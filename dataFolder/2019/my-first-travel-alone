Text: "There comes a time in your life when you need to escape, it is not the escape\
  \ from the routine of work, everything that goes wrong with your country or the\
  \ classic broken heart, it is that call of independence and adventure that gives\
  \ us every so often in our lives, this is how the need to make my first trip alone\
  \ was born. At that time, my job was to audit the distribution operations in different\
  \ parts of M\xE9xico, a very time consuming job and a limited budget, I visited\
  \ two neighboring states a week, a very tight schedule. Visiting the states of my\
  \ country and not being able to know them properly was generating in me some frustration.\
  \ Part of the work routine consisted of interviewing the staff, process that sometimes\
  \ leads to making friends, for some strange reason an auditor tends to get along\
  \ very well with audited personnel. During the meals the conversations became less\
  \ formal, which allowed me to inquire more about the local customs, the gastronomy\
  \ and the places that had to be visited. This is how I started doing the list of\
  \ the places I had to visit, at the end of November I decided to go to Playa del\
  \ Carmen in the state of Quintana Roo, I prepared myself properly, the budget was\
  \ reduced, the flight was practically free because of the miles I had accumulated\
  \ in my work trips during the year, I even got a free backpack, which along with\
  \ my dad's old military travel bag were my only companions during my trip.\n\n I\
  \ got some sort of a room that was really the living room of an Argentine girl who\
  \ had fallen in love with Playa del Carmen, she went there on vacations, but left\
  \ everything and decided to stay and live there, I have always admired people who\
  \ make such drastic decisions without looking back, maybe because I've never done\
  \ that, she became my tourist guide for the rest of the trip and every time I returned\
  \ from some experience there was an exchange of reactions from what I have seen\
  \ and learned, maybe because the common area of the apartment was where I slept,\
  \  anyway very enriching. \nI tried that the planning was austere, goal achieved\
  \ thanks to my Argentinian travel adviser, a napkin maps with the numbers of the\
  \ bus I had to take, quick advice on how to negotiate with the locals, where to\
  \ eat and most importantly the state of mind of how i had to live the experience,\
  \ \u201Cleave everything that you carry and enjoy this day\u201D, she said, and\
  \ so began I began my trip. \n\nThe first day I tried to do everything, I went running\
  \ early, the streets are dead early in the morning and the sun starts to rise, it\
  \ is an incredible feeling of peace and freedom, then I went for a carrot juice\
  \ and something else on the menu from a local market, that was the closest thing\
  \ to a routine that I had during the trip. In the afternoon I went for a walk, I\
  \ tried to talk with the locals, with very little success, I am not a person who\
  \ opens easily in a conversation, which makes the conversation very uncomfortable,\
  \ and so I become more of a spectator of what was happening around me, which led\
  \ me to enjoy my trip more. The rest of the trip was lighter, I put aside my planning\
  \ and went to visit places, took pictures, drank a beers, enjoy the sea, but mainly\
  \ I dedicate myself to observe, there is something magical in the sounds and gestures\
  \ that people make when they are in a natural and relaxed environment and that is\
  \ something that Playa del Carmen has, it allows you to breathe deeply and enjoy\
  \ the day.\n\nAt some point without realizing it, after the third day I started\
  \ to think that it was not such a crazy decision to leave everything behind and\
  \ live here, maybe if I had stayed longer, I would have another story tell."
