Text: "Everything changed after that one moment\u2026. Moment as soon as my father\
  \ hit the ground when heart attack hit him. I never thought poverty could lead my\
  \ family to this stage. But it surely changed me as a person for my lifetime!  From\
  \ being self-obsessed and selfish about myself at all the times I changed for good.\
  \ \n\nIt all began when I moved from a smaller city of India to the capital, New\
  \ Delhi. That move came with many challenges and many things to learn about life\
  \ at a very young age. I was only 5 when my parents decided to move cities for a\
  \ better lifestyle and opportunities for the family. Challenges associated with\
  \ the move made me independent because I had to face them on my own as my parents\
  \ had a lot going on at that time to keep us under a roof. Settling in the capital\
  \ wasn\u2019t so easy for me due to making new friends, fitting in with the new\
  \ lifestyle and people. The one thing that encourages me to work hard each day was\
  \ to be different and recognisable in the crowd of 1.3 billion.\n\nPoverty hit us\
  \ when my father was starting up his own financial business. We didn\u2019t have\
  \ much option other than sticking together as a family. Staying positive and supporting\
  \ each other was our biggest key to success. Financial hardship and stress led my\
  \ father into heart issues, which he could no longer handle. That news bursted out\
  \ to us at three in the night through his heart attack. That moment changed me hugely\
  \ as a person. I was shaken to see my father like that. The moment I grabbed him\
  \ into my arms and drove him to the nearest hospital taught me a lesson called \u201C\
  Life\u201D. In that moment I had realised I had been taking life for granted. Waiting\
  \ for taxi would have cause a big loss, so that dilemma forces me to drive all through\
  \ the way all alone.\nDriving my father to the hospital was the longest journey\
  \ itself. A young teenager who was just learning driving drove his father safely\
  \ to the hospital. A couple of day experience of driving helped me through. Watching\
  \ my dad drive, watching his footsteps move created an independent emergency driver\
  \ like me. My mom doesn\u2019t know how to drive then and I just took the responsibility\
  \ to save my father\u2019s life all alone.\nAs soon as I jumped in the car my body\
  \ was moving automatically. There was no planning and no thinking included in that\
  \ journey of how to drive. I just kept driving till I reached the hospital and admitted\
  \ my father. A couple of hours later my mother called and questioned me how did\
  \ I drive my father here, why didn\u2019t I wait for the taxi? how could I put myself\
  \ and my father in such risk. I had nothing to say except I did what needed to be\
  \ done. \n\nThat incident changed my family lifestyle forever. I took on role and\
  \ followed my father\u2019s footsteps. I did as he wanted me to do so. I was more\
  \ confident with my father from that day onwards. I was able to talk to him with\
  \ my heart open. Our father and son relationship just got stronger as we grew together\
  \ as a team. Poverty visited our doorstep occasionally but we had the power to overcome\
  \ that as a team. Eventually my father\u2019s business achieved its goal and we\
  \ started making more than enough money for a happy little family. Sometimes I still\
  \ can\u2019t believe how far I\u2019ve come with my family. Fighting through every\
  \ challenge, every problem, God tested us made us stronger as a family. All I learnt\
  \ from that experience was to give a try to everything and thinking \u201CI can\
  \ do that\u201D, make the difference in the society. That\u2019s what I am living\
  \ upon."
