Text: "One day on july 23 2013 i decided that it was time to travel to the unknown\
  \ , i had no idea it would be so beautiful . in that unknown country was this girl\
  \ that i met online. She was also so beautiful and i couldnt believe she was real\
  \ until i met her at that train station . shaking with fear and excitement i went\
  \ over to her . that wasnt everything her parents said to her dont go! dont go!\
  \ they forbid her to go out and meet me . but it was like a sign we both had that\
  \ forward drive to meet and our birthdays were almost the same hers on march 14\
  \ and me on march 13 . when i jumped online i thought to myself i need someone there\
  \ that can show me around so i went online and it was like our hearts just clicked\
  \ right at that moment . but lets go back to that moment where i was awestruck shaking\
  \ and in fear this was at the Porto train station in Portugal . was the best moment\
  \ of my life and to this day i am still with this amazing girl . but then you may\
  \ ask what about the inbetween what happened in the mean time. Let me tell you we\
  \ stayed at a nice house in porto . the first week her parents were calling her\
  \ everyday in fear of what might have happened . so the next couple days was scary\
  \ for her parents but as i built up the trust the fear started to fade away , 2\
  \ weeks later we are at her parents house Ola they said sounded to me like Cola\
  \ then as there whole family started to meet me and lots of questions they said\
  \ but now we are not scared anymore once we see who i was . what a relief i wasnt\
  \ such a scary person anymore but i only had a month there and then i had to go\
  \ back meet my other family in holland i was expecting it to be a long journey but\
  \ a good one . so as the month passed i had to go back to lisbon to catch up with\
  \ my flight there . so as i get there everything is okay then i started to notice\
  \ something fishy every 20 minutes there was a gate change for my flight it was\
  \ horrifying and then a 2 hour delay so i was like i got lots of time as i went\
  \ to the washroom there was 30 min left so lots of time for me. All of a sudden\
  \ there was no more time they had everybody borded and i wanted to go on and they\
  \ said the plane is just closing the doors we cant open it for you we are already\
  \ late so then i missed my flight . so i said okay i ll take an airplane in a week\
  \ . that was okay with the airline and it would cost me 75 euros . i said no it\
  \ was your fault in the end i still had to pay and so there i went back on the train\
  \ to barcelos where her parents where . i missed her already and she missed me to\
  \ so she was happy i was back for a little while longer then as the week went by\
  \ we did somemore sight seeing and hiking . there is so much to see in portugal\
  \ it was an amazing trip and i wont ever forget these memories there was one memory\
  \ that was my favourite tho the first time we were on our way to her parents we\
  \ missed the Barcelos estacao they call it so we stopped in viana do castelo yes\
  \ her parents were terrified at this point . i can imagine what they were thinking\
  \ who is this guy, what does he want . are we ever going to see our daughter again\
  \ and sure enough the next day we did take the train back what a moment that her\
  \ and me will never forget as i said best moment of my life . this was one of my\
  \ things i encountered while meeting my special someone . this is a true story \n\
