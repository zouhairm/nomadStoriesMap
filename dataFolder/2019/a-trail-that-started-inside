Text: "In January 02, 2019, I was in my hometown, alone and with no perspective at\
  \ all. I had a regular and boring new-year\u2019s eve, with a night spent with one\
  \ of my ex girlfriends and her family in her apartment.\nInexpertly, we had sex\
  \ after the midnight and it was a little bit comfortable, I confess. In fact, I\
  \ felt less miserable. \nBut when I came home, I start planning something in a hurry.\
  \ After all, I always try to find some adventure in my life, and I was decided to\
  \ not spent my free days at home. I needed to travel somewhere. Even if it was a\
  \ lonely trip. It would be an inner trip, but with some action, of course. So, I\
  \ made my decision: I was going to the mountains.  \nThere are some moments in our\
  \ life that we have to simply go. Pack our bags and go. You don\u2019t need to make\
  \ deep plans or schedules. Life is out there, just waiting for you to say hello.\
  \ \u2013 Hi, I\u2019m here. I came to see you. \nMountains, more that other places,\
  \ have inner connections with your real you. Some gods maybe rises there. Some mysteries\
  \ lives above the clouds, waiting for the braves that shall pass their limits and\
  \ face the unknown.\nIn January 3 I finally arrived in a place that I procrastinated\
  \ maybe for 15 years to be, afraid that I couldn\u2019t reach it alone. And it was\
  \ hard to admit that the path was easier than I expected. My heart felt rejoiced,\
  \ with the same feeling that I felt when I saw Disneyland for the first time. Or\
  \ the Monalisa on Louvre, or maybe Sistine Chapel, on Vatican. I was finally in\
  \ my Meca. Man! What a day! What a wonderful day. \nI had the most amazing 3 days\
  \ ever. Alone in my tent, with some neighbors, I confess, but with a considerable\
  \ distance. And the most honorable of them, shows up in the dawn, when nothing but\
  \ wind and bugs whispered outside. A mountain guar\xE1 wolf, an animal in extinction\
  \ in Brazil. Amazing creature that I could only hear steps at the grass. It was\
  \ amazing, but trust me, alone in a nylon tent, even if you know that should be\
  \ a stunning and harmless creature, you freeze. And to sleep at night became a luxury\
  \ at all. \nI try to climb the highest mountain at the park, alone. With no safe\
  \ equipment. Even knowing I wouldn't get to the top, I just wanted to try to go\
  \ as close as possible. Specially living to remember.  \nI did not meet no one at\
  \ that trip. I made no friends. I didn\u2019t ate nothing but noodles, cereals and\
  \ snacks. \nI felt cold, wet, loneliness and extreme tiredness. But I can\u2019\
  t remember a moment that I felt so alive in my whole life, as that day that I reach\
  \ a top of a mountain that I can\u2019t explain how beautiful, stunning and fabulous\
  \ it is. It was not the highest, of course. That one I stopped climbing when I realized\
  \ that I could really fall. And I turned back happy, but a little bit terrified\
  \ about the fact that I didn\u2019t know how to find the way back. But I did it.\
  \ \nI know, I could be dead. And I'm not proud of that. I should have more careful,\
  \ more fear and caution. Well, should I? I guess. \nThe only think I know is that\
  \ my days at the highs made me a different man. Again. Every trail is a path to\
  \ your inner destiny. A place with no bounds, no maps and no guides. \nAnd that\u2019\
  s what I have to say about my short January vacations. Those were days to be remembered\
  \ as days that filled some places inside me that no other times can do. And when\
  \ I got back, I was different after that. In a way that is hard to explain. It must\
  \ be experienced. And I really recommend it. \nNext time life gives you a break,\
  \ go find yourself in the highest mountain that you can travel for. Do it, and no\
  \ regret. \nGood luck. Just come back alive."
