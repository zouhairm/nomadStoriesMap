Text: "Bop-Kaap is unmissable. With its brightly coloured houses and streets filled\
  \ with history, it\u2019s on every tourist\u2019s bucket list for Cape Town. \n\n\
  I arrived early, ensuring that I would get to see the sun sleepily rise above the\
  \ flat rooftops. As I started to wander around, a small corner shop caught my eye\
  \ and I headed inside. \n\n\u201CDo you sell anything warm I could eat right now?\u201D\
  \ I ask the man behind the counter. He smiles as he points towards a display cabinet\
  \ of samosas. \n\nIf you\u2019ve never had a samosa, I highly encourage you to try\
  \ one. Meat, vegetables, and spices all perfectly packaged inside filo pastry- and\
  \ if it\u2019s slightly greasy, you\u2019ve got yourself an authentic one. \n\n\
  I buy one, bite into it and immediately buy another. He laughs and then asks me\
  \ why I\u2019m here so early. I explain how I know how busy it gets on a Saturday\
  \ morning, and how I wanted to avoid the rush. \n\nWe begin to talk about the neighbourhood\
  \ and it\u2019s story.  We talk about the Malays and the Indians and his own history.\
  \ \n\nI lean against the counter, drinking in every word as he beautifully describes\
  \ his life in his soft South African accent with a slight South Indian lilt.  \n\
  \nAs time goes on, more people come into the shop, and I finally ask \u201Cwhy are\
  \ the houses painted such bright colours\u201D guessing that they must\u2019ve been\
  \ asked the same question thousands of times. \n\nOne lady starts to laugh and tells\
  \ me \u201Cit depends on who you ask, but my favourite story is that they painted\
  \ the houses so they could tell which one was theirs when coming home after a drink\u201D\
  . \n\nWe all laugh, and I smile to myself; she feels familiar, they all do. \n\n\
  Standing there, I felt my own life reflected in theirs. A mix of cultures, a fusion\
  \ of traditions - being British born, but having a Jamaican soul. Everything clashing,\
  \ yet complementing at the same time. \n\nI stay a little longer, wanting to soak\
  \ up every bit of joy and happiness that seeped out of their smiles. However, I\
  \ eventually have to go and so I thank him for the samosas and the conversation,\
  \ and head back out into the streets. \n\nI look back at the collection of mixed\
  \ matched houses with a full stomach, heart and mind."
