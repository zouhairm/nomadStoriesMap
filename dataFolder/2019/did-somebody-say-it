Text: "\u201CJesus Christ, it\u2019s hot!\u201D At this point, it didn\u2019t even\
  \ matter anymore which one of us said it, our number of conversation topics declined\
  \ proportionally to the rising temperature. \n\nThe heat made it impossible for\
  \ me to think more than two steps ahead, my body \u2013 used to summer peak temperatures\
  \ I wouldn\u2019t even take a shower with \u2013 confronted with the fact that I\
  \ was basically walking through a sauna all day, simply switched into power saving\
  \ mode. \n\nIn no way I could have imagined this kind of heat and humidity before\
  \ actually stepping out of the plane \u2013 and now that I was here, it just made\
  \ me repeat the same outcry of agonized-joyful disbelief every ten minutes. Best\
  \ travel advice: Allow even the most basic things to impress you.\n\nLeaving our\
  \ accommodation adventurous and full of energy, we now \u2013 about an hour later\
  \ \u2013 were slogging each other along, three groaning puddles of sweat full of\
  \ spirit of discovery. \n\nEyes wide opened and pricking up my ears I tried to absorb\
  \ all the mysteriously familiar and yet so different images, sounds and noises all\
  \ around me: From the sweet classical music playing publicly all along the tartan\
  \ track which cushioned every step I was taking, being overlaid by almost deafening\
  \ cricket chirping everywhere, to the unbelievably high skyscraper not even a hundred\
  \ meters away from my walk underneath generously shady trees around this artificial\
  \ like with a replica of castle Neuschwanstein in its middle-\n\nThe further I immerged\
  \ into this strange now world, the more I discovered, the more surreal I felt. As\
  \ if I was an alien walking amongst earthlings I felt as if there was a thin but\
  \ insurmountable barrier between me and the inhabitants of this beautiful country,\
  \ as if I was walking in a parallel universe right next to them. Not in a bad manner,\
  \ no, just \u2013 a subtle alienation. Things like short eye contact, a friendly\
  \ smile between strangers, just overall taking notice of each other didn\u2019t\
  \ seem to be customary here. \n\nNext to the wrapped up, particularly elegantly\
  \ moving females our little marching column had more in common with the elephant\
  \ patrol of Colonel Hathi but there the heat\u2019s advantage came into play \u2013\
  \ we just didn\u2019t care anymore.\n\nExhausted as if we\u2019d just run a marathon\
  \ we settled down on one of the numerous benches aimed at the miniature castle.\
  \ \u201CDid someone mention that it\u2019s pretty hot?\u201D, someone chuckled beside\
  \ me \u2013 the heat was definitely starting to get to our heads.\n\nHappily limiting\
  \ ourselves to just sitting and breathing, people continuously streamed around us\
  \ like the current around rocks, two parallel worlds drifting past each other with\
  \ no contact are. But suddenly, a crunch.\n\n\u201CHello! Where are you from?\u201D\
  \n\nWe looked at each other, puzzled \u2013 then at the elderly men, who kept waving\
  \ an impressively huge paper fan, smiling at us with mischievously shining eyes.\
  \ I answered half-cautiously, never sure how people would react to our origin, half-curious\
  \ how this would turn out. Was it just an singular question out of curiosity about\
  \ our differing appearance with him on the way in the next minute?\n\nHis smile\
  \ grew even bigger. \u201CYour country helped us so much, they were the only ones\
  \ who would lend us money back then! Look around, all of this growth and prosperity\
  \ you see we could attain because of your help! Thank you and welcome!\u201D \n\n\
  Puzzled glances, a slight discomfort, hesitant smiles. Not only didn\u2019t I know\
  \ what he was referring to, I wasn\u2019t used to people associating positive historical\
  \ events with my country. We looked at each other, struggling with the same thoughts,\
  \ when the man\u2019s facial expression suddenly turned solemn: \n\u201CDo you believe\
  \ in a higher spirit?\u201D\n\nOh boy, where was this going? I nodded, baffled by\
  \ the course this whole conversation was taking.\n\n\u201CThen please pray for our\
  \ peninsula\u2019s reunion, just like your country reunited\u2013 you\u2019re our\
  \ role model for a possible future.\u201D \n\nI\u2019ve never heard such sincerity\
  \ and hopeful longing in a voice and suddenly realized that it was the same as ours\
  \ back then \u2013 our achievement was his goal. Our people were his people, we\
  \ all were the same.\n\nAnd suddenly, the alienness disappeared."
