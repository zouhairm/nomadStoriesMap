Text: "When we booked our trip to Russia, I did not know what to expect. It was the\
  \ first time traveling aboard and everyone indicated that Russia is a military country\
  \ where you are not allowed to smile. To my surprise, the Russian people were so\
  \ friendly and accommodating. Learning a few Russian words assisted me to be able\
  \ to communicate with the locals and to enjoy their awesome buildings. Churches\
  \ with real golden domes, the red plain in Moskau with it spectacular lights in\
  \ the night. It feels like living in a fairly tale. The most unbelievable was that\
  \ their is not littering and also almost no dustbins in Moskau. I noticed how clean\
  \ the streets were and that no one littered. The markets with all the little Russian\
  \ dolls and Russian hats are spectacular. You can negotiate the prices of the items\
  \ with the sellers and buy bargains of the most beautiful handmade items.  \n\n\
  The little towns in the country has a rich history and preserved their buildings\
  \ and status. To my surprise, I bought a beer at a local supermarket and when I\
  \ wanted to drink it, it was a beer syrup. Now at home I make pancakes and enjoy\
  \ it with my beer syrup - which takes awesome. Their local drink - kwas almost taste\
  \ like milk stout, but has no alcohol in it. The best Kwas can be brought from the\
  \ monks, who brew it themselves. \n\nPeterhof with all its amazing golden status\
  \ is describable beautiful. The atmosphere in  the park is peaceful and exciting,\
  \ with all the tricky items that Peter the Great installed in his time makes it\
  \ fun for the whole family.\n\nSt Petersburg, with its bridges opening at night\
  \ is breath taking and traveling on the river roads with beautiful Russian music\
  \ will make everyone feel loved and inspired.  \n\nI felt at home in Russia and\
  \ want to return to see and experience more of the Russian Glory."
