Text: "I never expected to visit my KOREA. Until this moment I didn't believe that\
  \ I visited it. It begun when I woke up on the morning of my birthday, my parents\
  \ pretended like they forgot my birthday, it was the best moment when i heard  that\
  \ they had booked a trip to Korea for me , my eyes were filled with tears and I\
  \ hugged them deeply... Korea is fast becoming one of my favorite countries to visit.\
  \ With each new dish discovered, with every Kdrama series that wraps us in its grip,\
  \ we fall in love with it more. Kpop culture has taken the world by storm . that's\
  \ why korea was my dream country. Also it had a rich history and offers its visitors\
  \ everything from the ultra-modern capital city of Seoul to villages where it seems\
  \ that time has stood still. The country has countless National Parks too, trust\
  \ me korea is the best destination. I have to wait two weeks brfore my travel but\
  \ I can't  wait because I'm so excited. Anyway The date of travel is approaching.\
  \ I was ready three days before the trip. Finally. it was time for me to arrive\
  \ at the airport. After completing the procedures. I was finally flying. I had to\
  \ get off in Dubai first then in Korea. I can't describe my feelings at that moment\
  \ when I got off the airplane. I'll spend a week there .I wish I could stay longer\
  \ but it's okay. First day and second day i spent it in Seoul, This capital represents\
  \ the futuristic race the country has run over the past years.  The pace at which\
  \ this city has been undergoing development is similar to those of Chinese cities.\
  \ It borders Incheon in the West and Bukhansan National Park in the North.  The\
  \ highlights can be visited in a few days but you will need weeks to discover all\
  \ areas of this stretched-out megapolis.I think to really enjoy a new country, you\
  \ should do at least a little research into the country\u2019s history and culture.\
  \ Even if you just watch some vedios about it and  it gives you more of a connection\
  \ with a place than not. By the way Visiting the DMZ is a must do when i was in\
  \ Seoul. The DMZ area can only be visited with a guided tour. seriously it was so\
  \ wonderful .Us another activities you can go on a walking tour in Seoul and discover\
  \ Seoul as a resident . Third and fourth day i went to busan my second best place\
  \ in korea , in Busan you will find yourself near the beach.  Haeundae beach is\
  \ a nice place to stay if you fancy a romantic stroll on the beach before you retire\
  \ to your hotel room. And the surprise was that the nearby Dongbaek park offers\
  \ splendid nocturnal views on the Gwangandaegyo bridge, better known as Diamond\
  \ bridge. OMG this two days the best days of my life. Nesxt day i returned to Seoul\
  \ to attend BTS's concert , BTS composed of 7 handsom talented boys , and my dream\
  \ was to meeting them, i love them so much .At first, I was so exited! I got to\
  \ meet  people who had the same interests as me! some of them had already been there\
  \ for hours! Personally, I waited over two hours for merch, and I met so many lovely\
  \ people, which I only knew for two hours! I loved standing in line, and I usually\
  \ don\u2019t like queues! It was very cool.The concert itself, was a whole other\
  \ experience. I still think many felt the same way as me during the concert it was\
  \ pefect i had so much fun i laughed , i cried ... the sixth day i was so tired\
  \ cause of the concert so i just visited some monuments in seoul . Last day i visited\
  \ lotte world so if you are looking for a fun place to spend a whole day, check\
  \ it out afterthat i bought some gifts to my parents to thank them for this amazing\
  \ trip then i returned to the hotel .  I have mixed feelings about leaving korea\
  \ in the next day but i'm-sure-that I will return in the future"
