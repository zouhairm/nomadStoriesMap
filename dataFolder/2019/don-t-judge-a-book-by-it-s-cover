Text: "Choosing Sri Lanka as our next vacation spot was not very welcomed by folks\
  \ around us, reasoning it by saying that it\u2019s like a trip to south India and\
  \ it\u2019s not a developed country etc. \nWhat we did not foresee was that we will\
  \ be mesmerised by everything there. Not only the places were beautiful, but extremely\
  \ clean and undoubtedly, better maintained than India. \nYes, the infrastructure\
  \ and people look similar to that of India but that attributes to the geographical\
  \ proximity. \nWe were overwhelmed by the fact that people indeed think progressively\
  \ and not just talk that way. \nBeing an economically weak country, Sri Lanka is\
  \ not regarded well as a tourist spot, atleast by Indians. But there is so much\
  \ beyond, that we need to see and learn. \nI didn\u2019t expect to find myself and\
  \ my family so delighted after visiting \u2018a not so fancy\u2019 holiday destination.\
  \ \nBeing vegetarians, the food was a challenge for us but it was manageable. \n\
  I was assured that I could walk on the streets at midnight and nobody would bother\
  \ trouble me. I mean how important and difficult it is to find a safe place for\
  \ women these days!\nShort , sweet and amazing was how my trip to Sri Lanka was."
