Text: "I never imagined that Yamaguchi had traditional culture where it\u2019s mixed\
  \ well with its nature in modern era. I was accompanied by my Japan Friend, she\
  \ is older than me. \nFirst place that I visited was Rurikoji Temple.  Beauty of\
  \ culture and nature were mixed beautifully in this place. The temple was a great\
  \ historical building with its Five-Storied Pagoda and its pond in front of the\
  \ temple. The place was so quite and I could relax well here while enjoying natural\
  \ scenery with bamboo around.\nThen,we moved to the higher ground. My Friend showed\
  \ me Amazing clap. I tried to clap my hands on a cold weather. \u201CI should take\
  \ off my gloves first,shouldn\u2019t i?\u201D I said.  \u201CYes, you should in\
  \ order to get clear voice back\u201D,she replied. I tried what she said, when I\
  \ clapped my hands, I heard the sound was back clearly. She whispered to me \u201C\
  Clap again,close your eyes and feel the Nature\u201D. The feeling when I closed\
  \ my eyes and clapped my hands toward the hill was so pleasant. I felt the peaceful\
  \ soul was back with the nature surround me.\nNot far from Rurikoji Temple, we walked\
  \ to the another gorgeus place. The place was decorated with nature view. The rivers\
  \ were on the right side and also on left side. \u201CI have surprise for you\u201D\
  \ she said to me. I replied happily \u201CWhat kind of another beautiful nature\
  \ place will you show to me again?\u201D. \u201CKeep walking, we\u2019ll see\u201D\
  \ she replied. My curiosity was answered when we had arrived. This place was ancient\
  \ cave. As we walked into the  cave,she introduced Cave\u2019s name was Akiyoshidai\
  \ Cave and described more about it. \u201CAkiyoshidai Underground 100m of National\
  \ Park, a large limestone cave of Japan. The Temperature is constant at 17 0C through\
  \ four seasons.\u201D She said. I also saw river inside the cave. What a beautiful\
  \ View! \nThen,we continued to Hagi City, The Town Of Hagi is a museum without roof.\
  \ I was surprised by the houses in this city. I saw all of these houses still maintained\
  \ the values of history itself. When I was there,I felt like I lived in truly ancient\
  \ of Japan. Hagi is one of rare towns in Japan where you can use old maps from Edo\
  \ Era for strolling. I was invited to Ceremony to have traditional green tea in\
  \ traditional house in Hagi. This Ceremony is for welcoming guest,green tea was\
  \ served by bowl. The taste was so good. \nJapan is one of modern country but it\
  \ knows how to keep the culture and its nature"
