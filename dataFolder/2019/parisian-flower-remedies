Text: "Business is booming in the florists across from P\xE8re Lachaise. Even in these\
  \ unsteady times, people flock from far and wide to adorn the tombs of the old heroes\
  \ they\u2019ve never known. \n\nIn the hotter, more humid summer months, the cemetery\
  \ sprouts rosemary and lavender thick and full. The florists double up as grounds-keepers,\
  \ fertilising the soil with a cocktail of composts to give some illusion of prolonged\
  \ life. You could be forgiven for mistaking the burial ground for an allotment.\n\
  \nPassed down through the generations, the P\xE8re Lachaise florists have been going\
  \ for nearly as long as the cemetery itself. Leaves and petals spill out from the\
  \ shop onto the street. There is a bouquet for every occasion: those that adorn\
  \ corporate boardrooms, those that commemorate soldiers and statesmen, that hail\
  \ baptisms and honour the dead perhaps, as well as those that ornament brides and\
  \ congratulate graduates. The florists are ever-present on the journey from birth\
  \ to death. \n\nNot far away from the cemetery the undocumented rose sellers weave\
  \ their way through the tightly packed terraces of a Friday night. They invade personal\
  \ space to tempt Cupid\u2019s bow. One euro for a single rose that has been carefully\
  \ stripped of its thorns and individually packaged. Umar, one of these vendors,\
  \ keeps twenty cents for every stem to send to his family far away. \n\nIt\u2019\
  s not easy; Umar\u2019s roots have been torn asunder time and time again. He\u2019\
  s taken his trade from Athens to Rome and from Rome to London and now he\u2019s\
  \ trying to make something of himself in Paris. \n\nIn some cultures, the idea of\
  \ publically declaring one\u2019s love in such a way seemed far too suspicious.\
  \ In London he went to many pubs but encountered fewer couples out alone together\
  \ \u2013 and if they were, they were either already too pissed to notice him or\
  \ too humiliated to want to engage.\n\nIn contrast, the Latin lovers would never\
  \ be seen without a cellophane-wrapped token of their affection. The trattorias\
  \ were heaving with vendors, plummeting the price of each stem and leaving profit\
  \ margins slim.\n\nFrance was a happy middle-ground, Umar learnt how to convince\
  \ Parisians this is what they needed. Speaking in broken English, he made bold declarations\
  \ on the impermanence of things and the speed at which time was passing. He very\
  \ publically proclaimed his love for the bar staff and inspired others to act upon\
  \ theirs. \n\nUmar issued tokens of gratitude as well as offerings of forgiveness.\
  \ Violet petulias for a pregnant belly; the florist\u2019s magic touch and the lively\
  \ bouquet ensured a safe delivery. Three of the brightest, proudest sunflowers bought\
  \ full recovery to a whole ward of bed-bound sufferers. Umar\u2019s floral instincts\
  \ had kept sickness at bay for as long as anyone could remember. \n\nThe neon-green\
  \ signs aloft Parisian pharmacies practically hum with electric lighting. They eye\
  \ is easily distracted, the mind frets about the ache here or the irritating burn\
  \ there. A city of hypochondriacs, there is always something to be relieve. What\
  \ if they know about Umar\u2019s green-fingered blessings? Is that not why the bars\
  \ and bistros heave with such youthful plenty?"
