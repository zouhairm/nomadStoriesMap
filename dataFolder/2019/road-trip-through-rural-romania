Text: "My grip tightened on the handrest and I felt my heart thump faster.  The car\
  \ began to float again \u2013 a weightless, free-flowing sensation as it drifted\
  \ towards the centre line.  Even most of the big trucks had pulled over by now \u2013\
  \ and they were professional drivers! Why were we still driving in this? The hail\
  \ continued to batter the windscreen and the wipers were working overtime but could\
  \ not keep up with the floods of water that were thrown up by the odd passing car.\n\
  \n\u201CRTR\u201D as we had dubbed it in our group emails \u2013 Road trip through\
  \ Romania \u2013 had started well enough at the Rembrandt Hotel in Bucharest. Wandering\
  \ through the streets we had seen the light and the dark, the beautiful and the\
  \ ugly; a city where the new was jostling for space against the old.  The ruinous\
  \ rooftop bars packed full of tourists enjoying an experience that the slick, steel\
  \ and glass buildings beyond could not provide, the kaleidoscope of colours of the\
  \ street art daubed across crumbling walls, and the filtered light that made its\
  \ way through the multi-coloured, hanging umbrellas in an alley. These were the\
  \ images that flickered behind closed eyes before sleep came, not the pristine whiteness\
  \ of the Palace of the Parliament; Ceausecu\u2019s colossus and the heaviest building\
  \ in the world! \n\nAfter the sun-filled days in Bucharest our real journey began.\
  \ We picked up the car that was to become the \u201CTrusty Duster\u201D and, as\
  \ the fear of coping with driving on the \u201Cwrong side\u201D subsided, began\
  \ to wonder what else we would encounter on our road trip through rural Romania\
  \ en route to Sofia, Bulgaria. The next few days passed with the radio, and conversation\
  \ full of laughter, providing the soundtrack to a whirl of yellow fields, fairy-\
  \ (or perhaps horror-) tale castles, mountains, spectacular gorges, richly decorated\
  \ churches, more churches and graveyards hung with beautiful flowers and brightly\
  \ coloured garlands.  \n\nThe joy we felt as the sun beat down on our pale, Scottish,\
  \ skins was tempered by the sight of farmers in the field.  Their skins had been\
  \ long ago browned by the sun.  They lumbered behind a plow pulled by a horse as\
  \ tired as they were.  The farmers, man and woman, hunched over, looked about eighty.\
  \ They were from another world, another century; one devoid of cars and iphones.\
  \ \n\nWe continued, more quietly, towards the Carpathian Mountains.  Our mission\
  \ for the day; hike to the top. After parking at a deserted ski chalet village,\
  \ we ambled up the grass and wildflower meadow under the ski-lift towers.  The going\
  \ got tougher higher up as the snow deepened.  The squelch of wet shoes convinced\
  \ us that the game was up and, reluctantly, we all headed down the hill and back\
  \ to the safety of Trusty Duster.\n\nOur second to last day dawned. Today was Transfagarasan\
  \ Highway day.  We had speculated the night before as to how far we would get on\
  \ the spectacular, twisty road - would the snow defeat us again?  By the time we\
  \ reached the massive concrete blocks that had been placed to prevent further progress\
  \ along the road, we were all happy to abandon the mist and drizzle for the nearby\
  \ caf\xE9. There we had our most Dracula-like experience of the trip.  The place\
  \ was deserted and we felt a glare as we crossed the freshly mopped floor. When\
  \ the manager, dressed all in black and deathly pale, began banging his head with\
  \ his hand as he repeated the coffee order for the fifth time, there was a little\
  \ bit of fear underlying our laughter. \n\nThat fear, however, was surpassed by\
  \ that I felt now. The hail stones hit with such force I was sure the windscreen\
  \ would shatter. \u201CPull over!\u201D, I said. \u201CEven the truckers have stopped\u201D\
  .  \u201CCan\u2019t\u201D, she shouted. We aquaplaned towards the centre line. \
  \ Suddenly, I felt the car regain grip.  A few metres further down the road, we\
  \ pulled over, amongst all the trucks, and sat in tense silence, waiting for the\
  \ worst to pass.   An hour later, the radio was back on, the sun was back out and\
  \ we drove on to Sofia \u2026 and the promise of salads."
