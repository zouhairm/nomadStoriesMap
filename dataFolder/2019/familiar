Text: "I called my best friend in a frenzy after booking my ticket, needing an outlet\
  \ for all my energy.\n\n\"I DID IT!\" I screamed into the phone.\n\nIn true best\
  \ friend fashion, she celebrated with me before asking what exactly it was that\
  \ I'd done.\n\n\"I'm going to Provendicales! And you should totally come too, we\
  \ need a vacation BAD, girl! In fact, just hang on, I'll send you a picture of my\
  \ itinerary so you can book the same route when you're ready.\"\n\n\"Are you sure\
  \ you're going to Providenciales? This ticket says Providence which is in Rhode\
  \ Island and not Providenciales in Turks and Caicos!\"\n\nAfter 30 minutes of side-splitting\
  \ laughter at the sheer absurdity of what that mistake would have meant if I hadn't\
  \ caught it in time, airlines were called and tickets re-routed. My trip was months\
  \ away, but I started planning my looks immediately. I decided to go for bohemian\
  \ chic with loose wavy curls and bright colors since it was a beach trip. I got\
  \ lost in the details of planning, making sure I was baking enough time into the\
  \ travel day to navigate rush hour traffic. I made plans to have someone to water\
  \ my fledging plants in the Texas heat and packed all 105 of the outfits I would\
  \ surely need on this trip because a lady must always be ready. Somewhere between\
  \ the excitement, the planning, and the packing, the time flew by and before I knew\
  \ it I was stepping onto the plane in Austin, excited to unwind on a beautiful beach.\n\
  \n\_In one of my earliest conversations with family after leaving my home country\
  \ for the first time, they had asked me what America was like, hoping to paint a\
  \ picture with my words. I tried to describe it as best as I could, and then they\
  \ asked me what it smelled like. The question was an aha moment for me because I\
  \ had spent the better part of a week trying to narrow down what it was that made\
  \ everything seem so foreign. It smelled of nothing. Ever since then, the smell\
  \ was always the thing I noticed constantly about a new place. I stepped out in\
  \ Providenciales and smelled the water before I saw it. The humid heat had a nostalgic\
  \ familiarity that made me relax and exhale so deeply that I wondered if I had been\
  \ holding my breath since I left home in 2014.\n\nAs we made our way from the airport\
  \ to the rented villas, stopping only to grab a can of the local brew our driver\
  \ insisted we try, I couldn't help but marvel at how calming I found the dusty roads\
  \ and quaint humble buildings. The landscape reminded me of the childhood road trips\
  \ my family would take from the bustling belly of Lagos city with all its palpable\
  \ rhythmic energy to the slower paced rural village my father group up in, with\
  \ its mango trees, lush forests and the nightly choir of crickets.\n\nThe first\
  \ thing we did after dropping off our bags was head to the weekly 'Fish Fry', where\
  \ there were tons of vendors, food sizzling on outdoor grills, a thick crowd of\
  \ bodies and an infectious party atmosphere. At some point in the festivities, a\
  \ dance battle occurred on stage between my group and another set of travelers.\
  \ There was no prize for winning but a lot of laughs, and a belly full of very strong\
  \ punch.\_ Providenciales was more picturesque than I had dared to dream, and it\
  \ was impossible not to gasp on seeing the majestic Grace Bay beach for the first\
  \ time. It remains the bluest water I have ever seen. I went to Providenciales to\
  \ get away from the sights that had become part of my daily routine, to remind myself\
  \ that there is more out there. I found the rest my body needed, peace for my soul\
  \ and a holiday romance sweet enough to inspire a dozen terrible poems. What I was\
  \ not expecting to find, however, was a zest for life that reminded me so much of\
  \ home."
