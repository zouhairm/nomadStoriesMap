Text: "Last summer I made the brave leap to go work at a summer camp in America; it\
  \ was honestly the best choice I\u2019ve ever made. It literally changed me for\
  \ the better. It was the first time I ever had to travel myself. Having to get from\
  \ Glasgow to Manchester then fly to JFK and finally get the bus the PA was so scary\
  \ for my first time going solo. When I finally got to Camp hearing all these America\
  \ accents it was like something out a TV show. I encountered some of the most unique\
  \ most extraordinary people ever. Our days off were unforgettable as we couldn\u2019\
  t drive cause we were Brits we took the bikes and cycled to lakes, beaches and made\
  \ the most amazing memories. After camp from almost getting arrest due to a police\
  \ man not believing that someone from Scotland was British/ had a British driving\
  \ licence as ID. To literally drowning in getting a concussion after slipping on\
  \ rock in Lake (don\u2019t worry I survived) just a sore head for a few days. \n\
  My most memorable travel story is the road trip from San Francisco to, Vegas via\
  \ LA and the Grand Canyon.  Me and 4 other amazing people had a grand idea of renting\
  \ a car to get us to Vegas, due missing our bus to LA was the cheapest option to\
  \ drive the 101 and I\u2019ve never been so glad to miss $30 bus. I wouldn\u2019\
  t have got to experience the west coast the way we did. After a few days in LA we\
  \ were going to Vegas for the rest of our trip, I told the group if we leave at\
  \ night we could drive to Grand Crayon and watch the sunrise then double back and\
  \ return the car in Vegas at 11AM. It was amazing idea. We set off in the hopes\
  \ of getting to mead view for 5am everything was going perfectly. It was 4.30am\
  \ when we thought we got there. We drove about this town trying to find the Canyon,\
  \ Beth said to pull over saying we should walked the rest of the way stretch out\
  \ legs. We randomly parked the car on the dusty sand road and we set off in basically\
  \ our Pjs, in the direction of what we thought the Canyon was in. An hour into this\
  \ walk and nowhere near this canyon just was getting closer to these hill things,\
  \ after and another 30mins the sun was up, getting extremely hot. We had no idea\
  \ where we were, and what direction we came in. \nAfter all it was a dessert. \n\
  No phone signal, no google maps, no water\u2026\nThinking of the best way to get\
  \ out the situation we copied mystery Inc and split up to search for a way out this\
  \ hell. Freya and me went off and then Beth, Melissa and Tasha in the other group.\
  \ An hour later in the sweating heat things weren\u2019t looking good, hearing a\
  \ mixture rattle snakes noises and birds of prey flying overhead and to top it off\
  \ I walked into a cactus not like a cactus you get from the garden centres. This\
  \ cactus pins were huge bigger than the length of my hand, and was stuck in my upper\
  \ leg, trying to pull it out was tedious everything went through the needle they\
  \ were so sharp it took about 20 minutes to ease it out. \nThen Beth miraculous\
  \ called to say someone found them, Janice the loveliest women ever. Saw our car\
  \ abandoned while walking her dog, she drove in and saw them by luck she also managed\
  \ to find us. To which she had then informed us we walked in the complete wrong\
  \ direction of the canyon. After being stranded in crayon Janice then drove us to\
  \ the store for much needed water and even dropped us back off at out car.\nJanice\
  \ the hero that saved the idiot Brits abroad!"
