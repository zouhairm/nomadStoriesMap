Text: "\u201CDo you want to get married?\u201D\n\nI was blissfully lost in meditation,\
  \ watching sets of waves roll over the glassy waters when Salah paddled over and\
  \ \u201Cpopped the question\u201D. After almost three months living in Taghazout,\
  \ a tiny fishing village on the Atlantic Coast of Morocco, this had become our daily\
  \ ritual - surf, eat, sleep. I thought I\u2019d died and gone to heaven. \n\nWe\
  \ were living in a one-room apartment with a drop toilet and a gas burner for cooking.\
  \ It was the simplest life had ever been and I\u2019d never known such happiness.\
  \ Three months might seem like a short time to know someone before charting a future\
  \ as husband and wife. But on Moroccan timelines, we were well overdue (and had\
  \ already been kicked out of one apartment for not being wed). \n\nLove was not\
  \ on my radar when I\u2019d arrived in this beguiling North African country, diving\
  \ head first into the chaotic medina of Marrakech. I\u2019d just come out of a tumultuous\
  \ relationship and was craving the freedom that travel offered and time to untangle\
  \ the complexity of thoughts in my mind.\n\nIn fact, Morocco hadn\u2019t even been\
  \ on my radar. I\u2019d been planning to return to South America and found a flight\
  \ through Casablanca that was cheaper than going direct. It was a split-second decision\
  \ to book and then I was there, dodging donkeys and carts laden with eggplants as\
  \ meat hung languorously in open-air stalls. \n\nThe narrow lanes of the Marrakech\
  \ medina felt stifling - it was the height of summer and the sun beat down relentlessly.\
  \ Camera-wielding tourists jostled for space while motorbikes aggressively beeped\
  \ their way through streets sign-marked \u201Cno motorbikes\u201D. Jet lag hung\
  \ over me and the persistent calls of touts trying to get my attention had me at\
  \ breaking point. I had to get out. \n\nI jumped on a bus and headed for the coast,\
  \ arriving in the whitewashed harbour city of Essaouira. Salt permeated through\
  \ the air and I suddenly felt I could breathe again. Regroup. \n\nAfter a couple\
  \ of days being seduced by Essaouira\u2019s evocative streets and fish market where\
  \ seemingly everything under the ocean was sold, I joined a group of English backpackers\
  \ heading south to a surf village I\u2019d never heard of. \n\nTaghazout revealed\
  \ few charms on first impression. A one-street town where men jangled keys trying\
  \ to lure holiday makers to apartments and a jumble of buildings blocked any views\
  \ of the sea. But as I ventured down side alleys, hole-in-the wall surf shops clustered\
  \ with boards led me to an azure ocean where waves broke with perfection. \n\nIt\
  \ was in the following days, marked by the tides, wind conditions and whims of Mother\
  \ Nature that I met Salah. \n\nDays turned into weeks as I kept pushing back my\
  \ plans to travel on, waiting for the thrill of the holiday romance to wear off.\
  \ But it never did. \n\nI was what you\u2019d call a \u201Cnon-believer\u201D and\
  \ never thought my ideas about the world would make me compatible with a partner\
  \ of Muslim faith\u2026or any faith for that matter. But with Salah they did and\
  \ the simplicity of our existence in Morocco and the strength of community in our\
  \ seaside village had me hooked. People lived not only by religion but an innate\
  \ belief that they were responsible for the greater wellbeing of those around them.\
  \ \n\nBack home in Australia, debate was raging about women wearing headscarves\
  \ in parliament and anti-Islamic sentiment was being propagated by right-wing groups.\
  \ It wasn\u2019t a world I was ready to return to. \n\nWe spent the next two years\
  \ travelling to all corners of Morocco - into the vast dunes of the Sahara Desert\
  \ and to the enchanting blue city of Chefchaouen - before flying east to Jordan\
  \ and island hopping through the Philippines. It was in those weeks and months living\
  \ out of one another\u2019s pockets that travel worked its magic, concreting our\
  \ shared ideal that the world was our oyster.\n\nIn a tiny village on the other\
  \ side of the world\u2026love can be found in the most unlikely of places."
