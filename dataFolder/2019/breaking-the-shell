Text: "I come from a simple family with ordinary values and ambitions, and for that\
  \ reason I was raised to become an ordinary girl. Even so, deep in my soul, I always\
  \ felt that despite living in a shell, I wasn't meant just for the ordinary. And\
  \ to find my inner purpose I decided to do what to my family sounded crazy and not\
  \ suitable for a girl: a long term solo travel.\n\nI discovered Malta at the age\
  \ of 25, while I was looking for a place to improve my English. I don't know exactly\
  \ the motives that led me to chose this destination, some people call it fate, but\
  \ after I arrived there my life was never the same again. And two months after my\
  \ first contact with this island, I was finally catching my plane to there. With\
  \ me, only an address, a bag, some money and a feeling of butterflies in my stomach.\
  \ But arriving at my accommodation other feelings started to appear. The place did\
  \ not look anything like the photos online. The neighborhood seemed dangerous and\
  \ dirty, with garbage on every corner of the streets. Strange places, strip clubs\
  \ and the worst part, no familiar faces. If something happened to me at that moment,\
  \ nobody would know. I couldn't stop thinking about my parents and what they would\
  \ say about this \"not suitable for a girl\" situation. \n\nSo I took a night to\
  \ organize my thoughts and decided that I would not fail with myself. In the next\
  \ morning I decided to pack my stuff, lock the door and get out of there. But to\
  \ where? I definitely couldn't afford a hotel and coming back wasn't an option.\
  \ Then a light came to my head: A hostel! I've heard good and bad opinions about\
  \ hostels, but one was unanimous: In a hostel you will never feel alone. After a\
  \ relentless search, stealing Wi-Fi from a couple cafes and knocking from door to\
  \ door, I've found an option that looked friendly and would fit my budget.\n\nI\
  \ rang the bell of Hostel Malti for the first time quite hopeless, imagining that\
  \ this would be my last option and that maybe I would have to find a way to recover\
  \ the key I left under the door of the other crappy apartment. Suddenly a guest\
  \ opened the door for me and, despite no one from the staff was working yet, he\
  \ kindly offered himself to show me the place. At that moment, when a stranger offered\
  \ me some help, I felt that my luck was finally changing and I could make that place\
  \ my temporary home until finding something better. And I was right about home,\
  \ but wrong about temporary. Because that place became my residence for the next\
  \ 6 months and also marked me for life.\n\nAt Hostel Malti I met people from everywhere\
  \ and learned lessons of life that I would never learn anywhere else. We were all\
  \ there for a reason, driven by a feeling that we were part of something bigger\
  \ than the ordinary values that were taught to us. Dozens of people with dozens\
  \ of incredible stories of life and a feeling of gratitude that united us as one\
  \ big family. Meeting those people and connecting with them made me realize that\
  \ something amazing had happened: My shell had finally broken, and I was ready to\
  \ face the world as I really am: A human being, special and unique, but not superior\
  \ to anyone else. No gender, no nationality, no skin color, no religion, no wealth.\
  \ Just me as I ever wanted to be: free, full and empowered.\n\nAnd before coming\
  \ back to my home country I decided to give another chance to the neighborhood that\
  \ I had fled in the begging of my journey, and for my surprise the image I had of\
  \ the place was just a reflection of my immaturity and prejudice. The neighborhood\
  \ was perfectly safe, clean, people were kind and they were there just living their\
  \ lives like everyone else. That taught me a final lesson that travelling makes\
  \ us see more than just our eyes and our minds are educated to believe. And that\
  \ is beautiful."
