Text: "A Bulgarian poet once wrote ''a person is really a person when he's on the\
  \ road''. And I not only agree with that statement - I live by it. There is something\
  \ about being on the road, which I have tried to explain to myself so many times\
  \ but I still cannot fully express it in words, it feels like they are not enough.\
  \ I believe travelling is the only way to experience the world and yourself, to\
  \ enrich both your culture and your spirit. It was on the road when I have released\
  \ some essential and important things about me, which I would not have otherwise.\
  \ One trip never ends - you always carry the experience inside you and, eventually,\
  \ it becomes a part of your true self. My first travel abroad was six years ago.\
  \ It was the very first time that I traveled without my parents, the very first\
  \ time I was on a plane among the colorful clouds and the very first time to collide\
  \ with different culture from the one I am used to, the Bulgarian one. This can\
  \ be scary for a little girl, but after all, it turned out to be an remarkable experience,\
  \ full of sunny moments and emotions, which I carry with me everywhere I go. I went\
  \ to Italy with my High school, which made the trip even more adventurous, since\
  \ I shared so many magical moments with close friends of mine. We visited Rome -\
  \ a city, which never stops, a city which takes care after its historical treasures\
  \ - the Colosseum, the Forum, the Trevi Fountain.. This capital is a combination\
  \ of the new and the old, it is very fast-moving and yet so, so peaceful. I was\
  \ stunned not only by the landmarks, which I saw but also by the atmosphere that\
  \ I felt... The one that you can find only when you are wondering without searching\
  \ for a certain building or street, the one that does not require any kind of equipment.\
  \ It is  more likely that you will be found by it. We visited Venice, the city of\
  \ love, which apart from its historical buildings - the impressive Saint Mark's\
  \ Basilica, Saint Mark's Square.. is full of music, tiny streets and places that\
  \ are waiting for you to explore. I remember how me and my closest friend, after\
  \ walking around the city, decided to sit down somewhere next to the Grand Canal.\
  \ We were chatting and enjoying the moment and every time a gondola passed by us\
  \ we were amazed. It was so simple and beautiful. Every time we traveled to another\
  \ city - Genoa, Pisa, Florence, Sienna, it felt like we are connecting some cultural\
  \ pieces together and by doing this, we were connecting some pieces inside of us,\
  \ as well. We were offered the best traditional dishes every region has - we got\
  \ to taste Italy in the best way, through its amazing food, we saw it through the\
  \ places we visited and we felt it through the atmosphere.  \n When an individual\
  \ does something new and exciting, such as going some place new, he should try to\
  \ make the best of it. Personally, I feel like traveling is a passion of mine. Every\
  \ time I end up in an unknown place, I feel refreshed, I feel brand new. As I said,\
  \ I cannot explain it... I can only feel it, which is even better, because I can\
  \ define it as something personal, precious, valuable. But somehow, I want to link\
  \ my  impressions and experiences to my words. I have always been keen on writing,\
  \ but only in a certain style. I would like to improve my skills and to somehow\
  \ convey something so beautiful in texts."
