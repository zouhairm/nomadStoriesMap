Text: "I arrived at the train station in Madrid at six o\u2019clock in the morning,\
  \ sleep deprived from a restless overnight train ride, but ready to explore. The\
  \ first thing on my agenda was a fool-proof introduction to the city; a free walking\
  \ tour. The tour guided us through famous sites including Plaza Mayor, Puerta del\
  \ Sol, and the Royal Palace of Madrid. After walking to an array of monumental landmarks,\
  \ we happened upon the greatest gem of all, the Monastery of Corpus Christi. \n\n\
  The tour finished near the rear entrance of the monastery, and the group quickly\
  \ dispersed, eager to continue onto the next items on their itineraries. A minute\
  \ later I looked around, to find myself alone, only surrounded by grandiose architecture.\
  \  The oversized oak doors towered twenty feet high, and I suddenly felt like I\
  \ had been shrunk into a miniature version of myself. It seemed as though I had\
  \ stepped into a dream, based hundreds of years in the past. On the wall to the\
  \ right of the door, at eye level, was a silver box, equipped with numbered buttons\
  \ and a miniscule camera. Fear grew inside of me, I took a deep breath, and with\
  \ a trembling hand, reached out and pressed a round button on this machine. A Spanish\
  \ voice sounded through the intercom system. Like a young child, unable to form\
  \ a sentence, a tiny high-pitched \u201CCookies?\u201D came out of my mouth. With\
  \ that, I heard something unlock, and a smaller portal hidden discreetly within\
  \ the colossal doors opened.\n\nThere were no sounds or signs of people around.\
  \ The musky, lingering smell brought me back to my innocent eight-year-old self,\
  \ walking nervously down the church aisle, anxious to receive the much-anticipated\
  \ Eucharist. Unsure of what I was looking for, I walked ahead and brought up face-to-face\
  \ with a six-foot statue of Jesus. His hands were at his sides, and his eyes appeared\
  \ as if he was disapprovingly questioning why I was there. I diverted my gaze from\
  \ his accusatory eyes, and to my left, was a long, dark hallway.\n\nHesitantly,\
  \ I walked ahead. When I reached the end of the corridor, nestled within the wall\
  \ was a lazy Susan, and to its right was a list with prices written on it. Unsure\
  \ of how to approach the situation, I attempted to pronounce the first line on the\
  \ list. \u201CMan-te-cados?\u201D \u201CNo\u201D, replied a voice from the other\
  \ side of the wall. I resorted to the next line down. \u201CPas-tis-sets?\u201D\
  \ After a short pause, I heard \u201CNo.\u201D Self-conscious of my horrible pronunciation,\
  \ I read the third line. \u201CPolo-voro-nes?\u201D \u201CSi\u201D, she replied.\
  \ With that, I took 13 euros out of my pocket, laid it on the lazy Susan, and with\
  \ a quick rotation, a box of shortbread cookies appeared in front of me. Breathing\
  \ a sigh of relief, and giddy with excitement, I walked away with a dozen perfectly\
  \ baked shortbreads.\n\nWithin this holy edifice lay a well-hidden production, creating\
  \ the most sacred sweets I had ever tasted. In Spain, when nuns enter the convent,\
  \ they agree to two things. The first is that they will cease contact the public.\
  \ The second is that they will devote their days to God and baking. Over the years,\
  \ I have had the fortune of seeing the Eiffel Tower, the Statue of Liberty, the\
  \ Taj Mahal, among many other famous landmarks. However, the moments that I remember\
  \ most are the unexpected surprises that I find along the way."
