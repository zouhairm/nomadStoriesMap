Text: "The scene: A small movie producers' office in Hollywood. The decor is old and\
  \ worn, and wallpaper is peeling from the walls. A window is open and a hot wind\
  \ occasionally blows the thin curtain inside the room. A man is sat at a desk. His\
  \ name is Stan and he is a movie producer. Soon, a second man joins him, sitting\
  \ opposite him. His name is Laurie. He is a writer. They begin to talk.\n\nLaurie:\
  \ I have an idea for a movie! \n \nStan (looking up from his desk): Great! It's\
  \ been a while, Laurie. I was beginning to worry. You wanna coffee?\n\nLaurie: No,\
  \ I had one at Starbucks on the way.\n\nStan (pressing the intercom): Candy, get\
  \ me a coffee, will ya. Now Laurie, tell me all about it.\n\nLaurie: Well, it's\
  \ set in Mexico City.... \n\nStan (interrupting): Mexico City! Mexico City? Seriously,\
  \ who sets a movie in Mexico City?\n\nLaurie: Have you ever been?\n\nStan: Well,\
  \ no. It's far too dangerous. Aren't there drug wars there? And what about that\
  \ pig flu?\n\nLaurie: No, no, you've got it all wrong. Mexico City is massively\
  \ underrated. It's an amazing place.\n\nStan: Sure, but for a movie? \n\nLaurie:\
  \ Yeh! Sure! It's got more history than it knows what to do with. The place is an\
  \ amazing historical city. It's completely unique, like no other city. And the people\
  \ are some of the most friendly you'll ever meet in a city of 20 million plus. As\
  \ far as dangerous goes, sure if you go walking into the wrong area of town at 3\
  \ am you're in trouble. Other than that, it's no more dangerous than any other big\
  \ city, I tells ya! As for drugs wars, I've never heard such a bunch of hot air...\n\
  \nStan: Really? But the newspapers...\n\nLaurie: Forget the papers. Drug Wars have\
  \ been blown out of all proportion, and Mexico City is the right place to shoot\
  \ this film. If you can handle a little pollution, it's got everything a film crew\
  \ will need. Great food, superb locations and the best bit Laurie? It's cheap!\n\
  \nLaurie: That I like, Stan! So what's the film about?\n\nStan: Well, it's about\
  \ people, really. It's about a moment in life when the chemistry between a group\
  \ of strangers is simply perfect, and something unique comes along for one brilliant\
  \ minute. It burns brightly and then, just as quickly as it came, it's gone.\n\n\
  Laurie: Break it down for me Stan.\n\nStan: It's about a group of travellers who\
  \ come together at a hostel in...\n\nLaurie: ...Mexico City...\n\nStan: ...right,\
  \ and for four brilliant days, everything just clicks.\n\nLaurie: Clicks?\n\nStan:\
  \ Yeh, you know. The mix of people is right. The setting is right. Everything just\
  \ works and what results is...\n\nLaurie: A Hollywood blockbuster!\n\nStan: Maybe,\
  \ Laurie. This film is not just about wandering around one of the biggest cities\
  \ in the world, taking in the sites. It's not just about seeing the Zocalo or learning\
  \ the history of a city that is over 500 years old. It's not just about partying\
  \ into the wee hours of the morning or enjoying a beer on a rooftop overlooking\
  \ the Cathedral. It's also about great conversation, and living for the moment with\
  \ a group of people that have never met before \u2013 and may never again - but\
  \ in the here and now, manage to strike up a vibe between themselves.\n\nLaurie:\
  \ Who are we talking about here?\n\nStan: I'm glad you asked. Let me tell you about\
  \ the characters.\n\nLaurie: Great! Good characters sell!\n\nStan: And these are\
  \ real people, Laurie! First, we have Gerry.\n\nLaurie: Gerry?\n\nLaurie is interrupted\
  \ by a man (unknown) who says...\n\nMan: 700 words or less? Stop being that person.\
  \ Travel writing isn't about word count. It's about expressing the experience, giving\
  \ people a sense of the experience so real, they can see it, smell it, feel it,\
  \ taste it and see themselves in the experience. That isn't a 700 word or less thing.\

  \nPS. This actually happened, and the story has just begun. You don't know the blind\
  \ date part yet"
