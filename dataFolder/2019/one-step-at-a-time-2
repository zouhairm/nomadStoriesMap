Text: "I had promised all of my people that I wouldn't hike through the Pyrenees if\
  \ the weather was bad.  When you start in St. Jean on the Camino the first 1-2 days\
  \ is hiking through the Pyrenees.   While there is some danger if the weather is\
  \ horrible, there is little doubt that people will tell you when not to go. I had\
  \ all of my stuff. I was unsure and scared. I didn't recognize myself. I felt broken.\
  \  \n\nI almost didn't go at all. I had called my sister, and told her that I may\
  \ not even get on the plane. I would fly from Portland to Chicago, spend the night\
  \ at her house, and then fly from Chicago to Toronto, Toronto to Paris, get on a\
  \ shuttle from one Paris airport to the other, fly from Paris to Biarritz, get on\
  \ a bus from Biarritz to St. Jean, spend the night and then maybe start hiking.\
  \  \"I don't think I can do this.\"  \"Just get to me. You are just flying to me\
  \ in Chicago. Just get to me and then you can decide.\"\n\nI got on the plane.\n\
  I flew to Chicago and spent the night.\nThe next morning, the household went to\
  \ work. I sat in my doubt. What was I doing?? I can't do this!! I became paralyzed.\
  \ I called my dad, \"I can't do it! I can't even get to the airport!\" He told me\
  \ to get an uber if I needed to but I was going to do this and he said, \"What did\
  \ your grandfather say when you went on an adventure?\" \"You can always come home.\"\
  \ .  \nI got in an uber and got to the airport and cried and got on a plane to Toronto.\
  \ \nI got in a plane in Toronto to Paris. \nI found the shuttle.\nI got in a plane\
  \ to Biarritz, now to not think about what I was trying to leave behind.\nI got\
  \ to the first albergue after I found the office to purchase my pilgrim passport.\
  \ \nThis was it. I was now a pilgrim. Kinda. I had to decide. Huge ball of anxiety.\
  \ Could I do this?\nI heard chatter around the albergue. It was supposed to be perfect\
  \ weather.\nShit.\nThe most perfect weather they had seen in a long time. \nShit\
  \ shit.\nThere was absolutely no barrier to hiking the Pyrenees.\nShit shit shit.\n\
  I panicked. I texted a friend. She replied, \"You climb. You can do this.\" I was\
  \ hiking the Pyrenees.\nI slept hardly at all, trying to adjust to the symphony\
  \ of snoring that would become my reality for the next 35 days in bunks across Spain.\
  \  \nI got up, put my pack together like I knew what I was doing. I got dressed,\
  \ went downstairs for breakfast and turned to the man next to me.\n\"Ari, can I\
  \ confess something to you?\"\n\"Of course.\"\n\"Ari, I'm scared.\"\nAri holds up\
  \ his fingers with a little space between them. \"This much?' He widens them a bit.\
  \ \"Or this much?\"\nI make a gap between my hands that extends and keeps extending.\
  \ \"This much.\" \n\"You can do this, Courtney. It is just step by step. Just follow\
  \ the arrows. You can do this.\"\nThere is a young man sitting next to Ari. \"I'm\
  \ scared too. Let's start together. I'm Michael.\" \n\"Dude, you are like 19...there\
  \ is no way.\"\n\" No, no,\" he exclaims in his Irish brogue, \"I haven't been training.\
  \ I bought my pack yesterday. We can do this together.\"\nI agree. \nWe finish and\
  \ set out. We become pilgrims with the first step. \nThe day is grueling and hot\
  \ and beautiful and hard and Michael and I end up on a patio in the middle of the\
  \ French Pyrenees in a place where I will stay for the night and he will continue\
  \ on to the next location and we will meet up 30 days later, yelling in delight\
  \ for having found each other again, squealing, hugging and crying that we have\
  \ almost made it.\n\nI have become the encourager for the fainthearted.  Because\
  \ I climbed the Pyrenees. We can do just about anything together.  We can do hard\
  \ things."
