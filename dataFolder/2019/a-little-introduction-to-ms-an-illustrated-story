Text: "On my 10th anniversary since my diagnosis, of Multiple Sclerosis, I am changing\
  \ professions from architecture to writer/sociologist, instead of investing my savings\
  \ into a masters degree I have launched a project to create an introductory guide\
  \ to MS, and believe me, it has been a crazy journey in just three months since\
  \ I started working full time on it.\n\nI want to share my experiences along with\
  \ other patients\u2019 experiences, doctors advice, and simplify some research I\
  \ have been doing over the last years in order to create consciousness about the\
  \ condition, involving an integral view, we are not only bodies to heal, we are\
  \ body, mind and spirit. This way I have approached the issue and been able to control\
  \ the condition without taking the aggressive medication I was prescribed initially.\n\
  \nI don\u2019t intend to find a cure for the condition but to create a guide and\
  \ a network of people who are struggling with similar issues,\nMS as a controllable\
  \ condition, not an incurable desease.\nEmpowering people to be responsible for\
  \ their own health from a positive outlook from people who have managed to have\
  \ quality of lifestyle even after years of their diagnosis.\n\nI believe we can\
  \ and must use technology in order to better our society, to help and connect people,\
  \ that\u2019s why I am intending to make this a free online book for future distribution,\
  \ initially in Latin America, since we lack quality information on the matter in\
  \ Spanish,\n\nI hope this to be my first of many social projects in which I am intending\
  \ to use the tools we have today to create an impact on different groups of people,\
  \ no society had been this connected ever before this era, and we are living challenging\
  \ times in which our societies are adjusting to the very quick pace of new technological\
  \ upgrades, \n\nWe can use this technology to create consciousness in a world that\
  \ is facing many challenges, global warming, automatization of labour, the end of\
  \ fossil fuels, water shortages, a growing gap among social classes, to mention\
  \ some.\n\nThis are some of the journeys I hope to be able to fulfill in a nearby\
  \ future, I know this story might have a big leap into the unknown, but thought\
  \ it was worth it to share it with you.\n\nEven if I do not win the trip, I thank\
  \ you for reading."
