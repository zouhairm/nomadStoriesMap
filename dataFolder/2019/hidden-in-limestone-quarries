Text: "When most people think of Parisian sightseeing hotspots, the things that come\
  \ to mind are the Effiel Tower, the Louvre and the gorgeous spires of the Notre\
  \ Dame Cathedral. What many people seem to forget is that the soil under Paris is\
  \ honeycombed with a landmark far older than even Notre Dame. The Catacombs; built\
  \ from limestone mines ageing back to the time of Roman empire and filled to the\
  \ brim with the bones of Parisians. Wealthy or poor, the bones of hundreds of years\
  \ of Parisians ended up in those dark, cold catacombs, arranged in spiralling patterns\
  \ and beautiful columns. \nWhen I went into the catacombs for the first time with\
  \ my grandmother, the first thing I noticed was the smell; it wasn't musty or dry\
  \ like one would think of bones that had been dead for hundreds of years. It was\
  \ damp, earthy and metallic like right after a thunderstorm in the middle of the\
  \ woods. Before we even got into the catacombs, down a circular staircase with at\
  \ least a hundred stairs there were three white rooms with flickering fluorescent\
  \ lights letting off an eerie blue-white glow. On the wall sat displays, explaining\
  \ what the catacombs were and rules for remaining safe in the catacombs. \n1. Stay\
  \ in the lighted areas\n2. No flash photos\n3. Don't Touch the Bones\nThen we entered\
  \ the actual catacombs, and they were organized, femurs on the bottom, stacked like\
  \ scrolls. Piled on top of them were the skulls of adults and children, cracked\
  \ and broken, with empty eyes that never stopped staring. The floor had small puddles\
  \ that glimmered in the lights stuck at random in the walls. The air was thick and\
  \ still, even though people were moving through it. I could hear a tour guide ahead\
  \ of us explaining how the section we were in was used in horror films. Somehow,\
  \ that made it worse when we passed the goat's skull tacked onto a stone pillar.\
  \ \nWhen we entered a chamber with a stone well in the center of it, my grandmother\
  \ and I paused, shivering from the cool air wafting in from two passages blocked\
  \ off with iron bars. I decided to peek into the well and see if there were either\
  \ bones or water in it. The well was filled with dark water that rippled with the\
  \ faint breezes. To my delight, I could see four goldfish swirling around in the\
  \ water. They were so peaceful in their dark world, just swirling around and it\
  \ was comforting; that in this maze of death and horror there were just four goldfish\
  \ minding their own business, eating the sparse algae. Behind the well was a sign\
  \ explaining that the fish were replaced every five years, as they did not breed\
  \ in the dark. \nIn the following chambers, there were stone plaques with prayers\
  \ scrawled on them in French, giving each church that had a graveyard in Paris at\
  \ the time their own unique section. There were some dried flowers sitting in some\
  \ of the skulls' eye sockets, adding some faded reds and yellows to the brown and\
  \ grey of the bones and stone. \nIn the final chamber, three prayers were scrawled\
  \ onto columns and the wall and there weren't any more empty eyes gazing at my grandmother\
  \ and I as we left the dark gloom to climb another spiralling staircase into the\
  \ bright sunlight of Paris."
