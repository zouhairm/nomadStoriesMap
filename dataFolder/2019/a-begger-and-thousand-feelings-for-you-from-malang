Text: "The plane landed smoothly in Juanda Airport, Surabaya, Indonesia. That was\
  \ my very first time for having a nice journey only with my sister. That was amazing.\
  \ I was a little bit afraid of someone around us, then we needed more than 3 hours\
  \ to reach our objective, Malang. \n\nI still remember how the sunset show the precious\
  \ gradation then smile at me. The orange and red of the sun hug me tight.  That\
  \ made me feel like you were next to me. I cannot count how many miles I have to\
  \ reach you. The sunset is full of meaning. Do you know, right? That day was the\
  \ best greeting ever.\n\nWhat will you do while waiting? Sleeping? Listening to\
  \ the music? Reading? \u201CNo\u201D. Dreaming? Ya! I was thinking about you and\
  \ I wish that we will have the best momment to share between the sunset in the future.\
  \ Also, I talked to my heart with thousands feeling. Happiness, yearning, hating,\
  \ oh no! That was complete.  An hour, two and finally we got there. Malang, a city\
  \ in east Java of Indonesia and a cold place.\n\nThe driver helped us to open the\
  \ car. The winds blew slowly and I can feel it right my bones. Malang is so cold.\
  \ My sister and I went to the room and lying on the bed with happy feelings. Inside\
  \ of my heart, I said, someday we will. I felt like, I sent a message by feeling\
  \ to you, my future. That was okay. I enjoyed it. \n\nThe next day, the sun appeared\
  \ earlier. No, I meant that, Malang is earlier than my hometown. I kept the jacket\
  \ in my body. I was hungry but i was moody. After making a decision to sleep for\
  \ a while again,  we went to outside and walking around to get meals for our first\
  \ breakfast there. I looked at the sky, smiled and sent my feeling, again and again,\
  \ to you through the air. How romantic we are!\n\nDay by day after my sister and\
  \ I taking a short trip in Malang, of course, after getting lost, I was shocked\
  \ by something that i have never find it in my hometown. It was about begger. Ya,\
  \ talking about beggar is  about humanity also. Seeing them with those conditions,\
  \ it was easy for me to see my self, have I done or completely success for doing\
  \ something for someone? For environment? I know that I am nothing but I always\
  \ want to be somthing for my country, for this earth. \n\nMalang has everything\
  \ for the people and tourist. The cold weather, also bright and clear sky. It was\
  \ easy for me to send my love for you from the sky. Malang has beautiful BATU. A\
  \ place with so many precious thing about green and the nature. This must be listed\
  \ for tourist. Malang, also, has the unique KWJ (Kampung Warna-Warni Jodipan). That\
  \ is a full color village. I felt like, my feeling appeared in that village. Yellow,\
  \ blue, red, pink, oh my God. How colorful my feeling is. Malang is about so many\
  \ parks, behind or in front of, there will always a a sound of those leaves playing\
  \ with air.\n\nMoreover, Malang is something that reminds me about a girl standing\
  \ under the stairs of Mall, smiling, then begging to everyone. It is about a 'Kuda\
  \ Lumping' dancer (traditional dance) in front of me while i was eating in a shop.\
  \ About a man with \u2018Tape\u2019 (traditional food) in his hands and walking\
  \ by his foot to sell those Tape. Malang is also about a boy selling celebration\
  \ card in a market and a secutrity in a church. That was all amazing for me. Such\
  \ a message from God to learn more then back to the real life and change what I\
  \ need to. Journey teaches me so many things. Of course, for you, my future, please\
  \ do not forget that from this, I will not let your heart go. Because I miss you\
  \ lots. So, let makes a trip together!"
