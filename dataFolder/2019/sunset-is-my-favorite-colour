Text: "I had left it all; the baggage of a bad relation and of a family that made\
  \ sure I am responsible for them; not that I did not like it--- responsibility.\n\
  I packed by bags and was hoping this to be my break, far far away.\n-----------\n\
  The beautiful Stone Town in Zanzibar and the alleys and streets decorated with artisans\
  \ and their paraphernalia, the fragrance of Zanzibari spices and people. There was\
  \ something magical about this town, it was beyond translation. I was dying to see\
  \ what the beautiful Indian Ocean has to offer-- had heard about the white sand\
  \ beaches of Zanzibar and the mystical element of the sea with splash of green and\
  \ blue. \n\nA one and a half hour long drive to Nungwi was an experience-- passing\
  \ through the hustle and bustle of the life of locals and sea on the side. I went\
  \ straight to the sea, I wanted to let it all go-- her, them. \nThat's the beauty\
  \ of a foreign place, no one judges you, we are all in acceptance of each other\
  \ here- our darknesses, flaws, choices and utmost our sex. I am bisexual. And it\
  \ was not working quite rightly for me in India. She chose to leave me and marry\
  \ someone--\xCD do not have the strength to fight it, was her justification. When\
  \ my family got to know about this, they wanted me dead, forgetting the years of\
  \ sacrifices that I had made for them.\n\nBut this was a different me. Happy and\
  \ high on a few pints of beer. \n\nI was least concerned and least bothered. I was\
  \ in love, with the sea and myself, I cherished the newness and had no regrets of\
  \ the post. Because this is what it is, society. They will judge you always.\n\n\
  I went near to the sea, dipped my feet, played with the waves and watched the sunset,\
  \ 'Sunset is my favorite colour', I said to myself."
