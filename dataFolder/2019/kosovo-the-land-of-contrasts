Text: "As usually before the flight I woke up full of excitement. Today I am taking\
  \ a flight to Kosovo. The country I know nothing about. Well, not really nothing.\
  \ As a political science graduate I was familiar with it's geographical position,\
  \ bloody fight for independence and the ethnicity of the majority of population.\
  \ However, I had no idea about the culture, traditions and culinary scene. Unfortunately\
  \ there is no direct flight between Lithuania and Kosovo, so I had a lay over in\
  \ Istanbul. At that time, I did not know, that I was eligible to receive a free\
  \ hotel stay from Turkish airlines, but the more you travel, the more you learn.\
  \ So, after the long travel I finally reached the capital - Pristina. The airport\
  \ in Kosovo is very modern and well-maintained.\n\tAlthough there are quite a lot\
  \ of flights going on, there is no direct bus from the center of the city and airport.\
  \ On a positive note, the taxi is not super expensive, you would pay something around\
  \ 15 euros per car. \n\tThe city of Pristina surprised me with the amount of the\
  \ cafes and people strolling in the late evenings. Thus, the city is absolutely\
  \ safe. One of the main attractions for me in every trip is going to the local independent\
  \ coffee shop to try what they have. Honestly, the quality of coffee in Pristina\
  \ was only comparable to the one you get in Italy. I would consider another trip\
  \ to this city just for the chance to sit in one of the cosy outdoor terraces and\
  \ sip amazing coffee. Another thing, worth to mention, is the nightlife. People\
  \ dress to impress and go out to have fun. All the night clubs were full of people,\
  \ locals and foreigners alike. The music playing was a mixture of the international\
  \ and Albanian bests. \n          There are many unforgettable places to see in\
  \ Kosovo, but this time I would like to focus on the capital. My personal favourites\
  \ of Pristina:\nNewborn Monument, Ethnography Museum, Mother Theresa Square, City\
  \ Market\n         Food in the country is simply amazing. Although there is a lot\
  \ of meat and bread on the menu, there are quite a lot of options for vegetarians\
  \ too. Not to mention how fresh and affordable food is. My personal favorite was\
  \ the pepper in the cream and some freshly baked bread. Also, I was lucky enough\
  \ to stop by an amazing shop, selling fresh baklava, which was super delicious and\
  \ made me come back couple of days later. \n\tKosovo is not full of tourists yet\
  \ and is still very undiscovered place. It is an ideal escape for people, who is\
  \ tired of the crowds and heavily touristic cities. My personal discovery was definitely\
  \ the fact on how safe and well developed country is. Despite the fact, that a lot\
  \ f people are still afraid to go to the place, I was amazed by the beauty of the\
  \ country. \n\tYou won\u2019t need public transport here, as distances are short\
  \ and you can easily walk there, but in case you need, taxi is a good option. Always\
  \ ask hotel or cafe to call a taxi for you. If you catch taxi on the street, agree\
  \ on the price beforehand. Another great plus is that you can easily travel across\
  \ Balkans. Skopje is only 2 hours away from Prizren.\n\tActually, it is not to difficult\
  \ to find a person, who speaks English. However, you would have more luck with German\
  \ and Italian. A lot of people used to work abroad or have relatives who does. I\
  \ believe that summer is the best time to visit the city, as you have long days,\
  \ a lot of greenery and fresh vegetables. Kosovo is relatively small, so it is easy\
  \ to visit other parts of the country as well. People are general very friendly.\
  \ Even f they cannot help you, they would typically ask other people around, if\
  \ they can help you. \n\tAll in all, Kosovo is a country of contrasts. Pristina\
  \ is affordable and safe capital, with an incredible cafe and nightlife culture.\
  \ My verdict is \u2013 visit the land of eagles now, while it is not too overcrowded\
  \ with tourists."
