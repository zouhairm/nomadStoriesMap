Text: "Unknown has great power for these unknown draws us towards new experiences\
  \ in life. It might be following a rabbit at night, trying out a new activity replacing\
  \ daily practice, exploring a new place in a foreign land, trying a new dish for\
  \ the first time, changing jobs or migrating to a new country \u2013 any small or\
  \ bigger leap towards the unknown is always fearful. But these unknown encounters\
  \ help us expand and evolve.\nDuring my Master\u2019s degree in Ireland, we had\
  \ planned a road trip in the giant Atlantic Way covering the entire ring of Kerry\
  \ starting from the Torc waterfall to the gap of Dunloe. The trip was essentially\
  \ on a car run amidst impressive and truly breathtaking scenery, but we couldn`t\
  \ resist stopping at every place in the hedge just to see what`s there. By the late\
  \ evening of day 1 of our tour, we reached the destination Portmagee through the\
  \ Ring of Kerry. With the fresh air, we were worn out when we hit the hay and slept\
  \ very soundly indeed.\n\nNext day we could not visit the world-renowned Skellig\
  \ Michael because of the bad weather and not so great sea conditions. Hence we decided\
  \ to do a drive towards an unknown road around the Valentia Island and headed up\
  \ in an insanely high road towards the Cliffs of Kerry. After the halt at one of\
  \ the cliffs we continued towards the road, which lead us to a Handmade Candles\
  \ shop, this studio was unique, exceptional and rare. One cannot resist from purchasing\
  \ such beautiful candles made with essential oils, cinnamon, honey, lime etc. children\
  \ can make their own little candles as a wonderful keepsake of their island adventure.\
  \ \n\nWe also spotted a cafe called the Knightstown coffee bar on this adventure\
  \ around Valencia island in the evening and was drawn to the very creative and interesting\
  \ cups hanging all over the caf\xE9. The bookstore as a part of the caf\xE9 had\
  \ an amazing selection, great prices, simply too many books to stack neatly.\nThe\
  \ third day was our returning back journey to Cork which we took through Cahersiveen\
  \ where we had our Irish breakfast. The Atlantic way looked more wonderful as we\
  \ entered the Gap of Dunloe. The ride up to the Gap is exhilarating enough, but\
  \ when we got to the top, we were blown away!\nWhile getting down the road we lost\
  \ our way again, with no internet and google maps we were stuck in the land of unknown.\
  \ This is when we decided to go with the flow and take the road that comes up ahead\
  \ without much thinking, this road leads us to one of the most beautiful landscapes\
  \ of the entire trip. The road was getting narrow but the view was breathtaking\
  \ and hence we decided to take some photographs and then move ahead with the journey.\
  \ This unknown road eventually guided us towards our destination Cork.\n\nTaking\
  \ the unknown road in a foreign land amongst the mountainous route could look scary\
  \ at the beginning but the adventure we had in this path are the memories for a\
  \ lifetime."
