Text: "Riding camels in North Africa and petting elephants in Southeast Asia. Long\
  \ nights and early mornings at Spanish Botellones and salsa bars. Tenting on a rooftop\
  \ in Nepal, surrounded by 360 degrees of Himalayan Mountains. Holding baby crocodiles\
  \ in Australia. The Taj Mahal, Mount Everest, La Alhambra, the Eiffel Tower, the\
  \ Coliseum, Buckingham Palace. Museums and castles and parks and rivers and oceans\
  \ and coffee shops and hostels.\nThese are all (or almost all) actual experiences\
  \ I have had over the years. As fun and wonderful as they all were, sometimes it\
  \ is difficult to share about those experiences once I am \u201Cback to reality.\u201D\
  \ What happens when you come home? What do you do when the dust settles, you\u2019\
  ve unpacked your suitcase, shown off your souvenirs, regardless of the fact that\
  \ you\u2019ve been forever changed, completely transformed by the experiences you\
  \ had overseas? How do you put words to your experiences? Well, I put it easily,\
  \ since I'm TV Reporter and Journalist who made dozens of stories for the local\
  \ TV stations and blogs. But this is not a story about how it was, rather how it\
  \ will be once I make a local connection between all these places I have visited\
  \ and my home country Bosnia and Herzegovina, still mostly recognised by war. My\
  \ goal is to change that oversimplified and widespread picture of Bosnia and to\
  \ offer more educative, profound and amousing perception of such beautiful country."
