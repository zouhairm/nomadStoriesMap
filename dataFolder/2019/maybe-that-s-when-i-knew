Text: "I have long come to the conclusion that spontaneous decisions end up being\
  \ the best. Sometime in rainy and muddy March in Moscow, hiding under the blankets\
  \ with my laptop and trying to do tedious job-searching, I got the courage to apply\
  \ for a volunteering work camp. It turned out to be life-changing. \n\nSo there\
  \ I was: quitting my job to spend two weeks volunteering at a jazz festival in some\
  \ remote village town in the south of Italy. Two aeroplanes, a train, a bus, three\
  \ full loops of my travel playlist and five cups of coffee later \u2013 there I\
  \ was. I stood there, at this empty station: suitcase too big for me to handle,\
  \ clutching at my ukulele, like a lost child in a supermarket.\n\nAll the way to\
  \ the house we talked, looking at each other through the rear-view mirror. I couldn\u2019\
  t have known it yet, but I could feel this warm fuzzy feeling stirring up in my\
  \ stomach \u2013 the anticipation of a new adventure. When we got there it was as\
  \ if the whole village had been waiting just for me. \n\nOn the first night, we\
  \ celebrated as if it was our last day on Earth. The 300-year old oak was wrapped\
  \ with fairy lights, but the stars outshone them. My feet hurt from all the dancing,\
  \ my teeth were red from all the wine. He picked up the guitar and played the only\
  \ song he knew. And just like in the books, it turned out to be my favourite. Maybe,\
  \ that\u2019s when I knew. That night I slept so tight I didn\u2019t even dream.\n\
  \nAnd when the festival started, it really was magical. I saw them all come in:\
  \ beautiful women in heeled sandals, men in linen jackets, teenagers, frantically\
  \ looking for someone to buy them a beer, old couples, holding each other and walking\
  \ in perfect symmetry. I poured beer and listened, mesmerised, to others speaking\
  \ this language that I was yet trying to tame.\n\nThe top of the castle was glowing\
  \ in all the blues, the purples and the reds of flashlights. The view from the top\
  \ was almost surreal: as if we were the only people alive in the middle of a dormant\
  \ sea. The rustle of a soft summer wind in the trees was in perfect unison with\
  \ the deep full whisper of a double bass. The smells embraced and cradled you around\
  \ every corner: freshly cut cheese, boiling pasta, sizzling steaks and fried pepper.\
  \ I wandered in awe holding in a plastic cup the ultimate taste of summer \u2013\
  \ Aperol, with a little too much Prosecco. Suddenly, someone\u2019s gentle nudge\
  \ woke me up \u2013 the sangria was ready, and it was time to dance. Maybe, that\u2019\
  s when I knew.\n\nOr maybe on that night, when we drove through the pitch-black\
  \ night highway, his hand, always holding a lit cigarette, resting on the wheel.\
  \ We listened to Tchaikovsky, silently, the beauty of his music matching the beauty\
  \ of the moment so perfectly, I held my breath in fear of disturbing it. \n\nOn\
  \ the last night, a grey-haired neighbour with smiling eyes told me something that\
  \ only he knew to be true, and was right, of course. And as we stood there, again,\
  \ under that 300-year old oak, trying to see the stars through its thick branches,\
  \ somehow I knew that this was just the beginning."
