Text: "''Neden ?'' (Why?)  Nedim asked knitting his dark thick eyebrows and stroking\
  \ his well trimmed long beard. I was looking at him through the rose-red colored\
  \ apple tea which his old grandfather offered me soon after I entered their gift\
  \ shop. I lowered my glass to my lips and pulled a steady sip and answered raising\
  \ my left eyebrow '' I don't know\". The tea was hot, so sweet with a little bit\
  \ of sourness. However I never thought that a hot beverage on a hot day can cool\
  \ me down. \n\nEarlier this morning, I decided to take a walk from Yenikapi to SultanAhmet-Fatih\
  \ to visit Hagia Sophia Museum (One of the most impressive museums of Istanbul;\
  \ built as a Christian church, then converted into a mosque, now serving as a museum.\
  \ It would take 32 minutes according to google map. Walking down a cobblestoned\
  \ street of \u015Eehit Mehmet Pa\u015Fa Yoku\u015Fu, I almost tripped down a stair\
  \ on the left side walk. Luckily, I balanced myself and looked down to the wide\
  \ entrance to a small gallery shop. I climbed down the four stairs and entered.\
  \ \n\n''Merhaba '' A tall broad shouldered man approached with a smile. His name\
  \ is Nedim Kaya - the owner of the shop. He speaks four languages: English, Italian,\
  \ Spanish and Turkish (his native language). As soon as I mentioned I was from Jordan,\
  \ his excitement lit the shop asking if I've ever been to Petra, the rose-red city\
  \ of the Nabataeans. ''No'' I answered while his grandfather handled me a clear\
  \ curved glass filled with a rose-red beverage (Elma \xE7ay\u0131)\n\n''Neden?''\
  \ he asked as his excitement faded in the two vertical creases between his eyebrows.\
  \  \n\n I continued drinking my tea as my eyes traveled between the Turkish flat\
  \ woven kilim rugs hanged on the back wall of the shop, the different Turkish sightseeing\
  \ models placed on the wooden shelves on both side walls and the colorful mosaic\
  \ lamps hanging from the ceiling. The sun -as it passes through the lamps - throws\
  \ colorful light shadows on the white marble floor.  \n\n''You mentioned earlier\
  \ you're Jordanian, but you don't look middle-eastern at all'' Nedim said scratching\
  \ his bald head\n'' I'm half Asian; my mother is from,'' I turned the terrestrial\
  \ globe- which is placed on his desk between us - and pointed to the southeast Asia.''\
  \ The Philippines.'' \n''I can tell she has strong beautiful genes'' he said looking\
  \ at me. I couldn't help but to blush. Now my cheeks match my dusty rose Hijab and\
  \ the apple tea in my cup.\nHe then turned the globe back pointing to a place in\
  \ Europe. ''My father is from Italy. '' he paused ,moved his finger and pointed\
  \ at a familiar place for me .''Petra, It's where he and my mother met and fall\
  \ in love,'' he sighed.'' I never met him ; He left us before I was born and we\
  \ haven't heard from him again ''. \n\n''GPS signal lost'' my phone suddenly said.\
  \ We stared at each other with our sobbed eyes and burst into laughter. \n\nI couldn't\
  \ leave without buying something, so I choose a nicely crafted model of the Hajia\
  \ Sofia Museum. Nedim wrapped the model carefully in a bubble wrap with the bubbles\
  \ facing the model .He wrapped it up entirely multiple times to  protect it from\
  \ breaking on my way back to Jordan. He gave me a bag with the wrapped model, along\
  \ with a local map and an envelope of Elma \xE7ay\u0131.\n\nI climbed up the few\
  \ stairs outside the shop and looked back. I thanked them for their kindness and\
  \ hospitality and promised that the next time I'm sipping a cup of Elma \xE7ay\u0131\
  \ it would be in the rose-red city of Petra."
