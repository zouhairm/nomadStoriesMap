Text: "It was early afternoon, but the sky was darkening as I boarded the bus in San\
  \ Lorenzo de El Escorial. I couldn\u2019t be sure of what I would find once I arrived\
  \ at my destination, but I had an idea. And it seemed that the ominous weather was\
  \ fitting.\n\nThe other travelers and I sat in silence, though our bus driver hummed\
  \ along to an English pop song. There were only five of us on this bus, which could\
  \ have easily held 50 or more, but the silence told me that each of us recognized\
  \ the gravity of where we were going. Each of us had made a conscious decision to\
  \ embark on this specific journey. With only one, nearly-clandestine bus going up\
  \ the mountain each day, it was a journey that the Spanish patrimonio nacional \u2013\
  \ state agency \u2013 had purposefully made difficult. \n\nI recognized this and\
  \ decided not to let it deter me. In my research, every traveler\u2019s review had\
  \ warned: \u201CDo not attempt this trip without a tour group. It\u2019s too confusing.\u201D\
  \ But my degree in Spanish had taught me enough history to fuel my resolve to visit\
  \ and enough language skills to navigate the way \u2013 I hoped. It was also my\
  \ first-ever solo trip. I figured that even if I made the attempt and failed, at\
  \ least no one would be upset with me. But I\u2019d caught the bus, and we were\
  \ on our way.\n\n20 minutes later, we arrived at our destination. A 500-foot-tall\
  \ stone cross \u2013 the largest in the world \u2013 extended out of the mountainside,\
  \ an imposing presence against the swirling gray sky. Built into the rock, under\
  \ the cross, was the entrance to a gigantic basilica. This was the Valle de los\
  \ Ca\xEDdos, or the Valley of the Fallen. \n\nIn theory, this is a monument to all\
  \ victims of the Spanish civil war, which raged from 1936-1939 and ended with dictator\
  \ Francisco Franco\u2019s rise to power. The remains of more than 40,000 victims\
  \ are housed at the monument, with soldiers from both sides of the war. According\
  \ to Franco, Valle de los Ca\xEDdos was meant to be a symbol of national atonement\
  \ and reconciliation.\n\nBut the truth, I learned, isn\u2019t so straightforward.\n\
  \nLight rain was beginning to fall, so I made my way into the basilica. It took\
  \ a moment for my eyes to adjust to the lack of light, and the first thing I noticed\
  \ was a sign stating that photos were prohibited. As if a camera could pick up anything\
  \ in the shadowy interior, I thought. The next thing I noticed were two formidable-looking\
  \ angel statues flanking either side of the entry hall. They held formidable-looking\
  \ swords.\n\nI walked down the central nave of the church, footsteps echoing. A\
  \ knot in my stomach grew as I reached the altar. There in the floor, in gleaming\
  \ white, was Francisco Franco\u2019s tomb. A small bouquet of fresh flowers wrapped\
  \ with Spanish red-and-gold ribbon had been placed thoughtfully on the stone.\n\
  You wouldn\u2019t know it from visiting, but for the past 40 years, Spain has been\
  \ debating: should Franco be buried elsewhere? In fact, if you didn\u2019t have\
  \ any context, you wouldn\u2019t learn much of anything from visiting Valle de los\
  \ Ca\xEDdos. There are no information placards, nothing to tell visitors what to\
  \ think or how to make sense of this place.\n\nThat\u2019s because Spain itself\
  \ still isn\u2019t sure what it thinks.\n\nWhen it comes to matters of their civil\
  \ war and the ensuing dictatorship, Spain has taken an interesting stance. It\u2019\
  s known as the pacto de olvido \u2013 the pact of forgetting. Rather than processing\
  \ the legacy of Francoism, Spanish society has essentially made a pact to pretend\
  \ it never happened; to focus only on the future and not the past.\n\nIt\u2019s\
  \ true that the monument has a history much darker than the narrative Franco attempted\
  \ to paint. It was built with war prisoner labor, and some have even likened it\
  \ to a concentration camp. Francoists and right-wing extremists still see it as\
  \ a pilgrimage site. \n\nBut as much as Spain tries to forget, there will always\
  \ be those who understand the importance of remembering."
