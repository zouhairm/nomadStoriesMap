Text: "The club was packing in the crowd as I took a sip of my margarita and waited\
  \ for the staff to set up my hookah. I looked around to see if there was anyone\
  \ I know in the venue. The Nigerian DJ spotted me and waved from the decks, in between\
  \ spinning the latest African pop music. I waved back and smiled. I heard some Arabic\
  \ spoken from the table next to mine and found some Sudanese youths getting on with\
  \ their weekend plans there. \n\nI watched the bodies and feet synchronizing on\
  \ the dance floor to the shaku shaku \u2013 a dance move that was making waves across\
  \ Africa. I was miles away from the continent but its vibe definitely filled up\
  \ the air in the club right here in Kuala Lumpur (KL). \n\nMy regular weekend trips\
  \ to Malaysia\u2019s capital had opened my eyes to the migrant communities there\
  \ and they were a seamless part of my travel experience, whether I\u2019m having\
  \ dinner at a Middle Eastern restaurant or checking in with the Nepali security\
  \ guards at the Airbnb property I\u2019m staying in. The same guards who watched\
  \ me leave in the middle of the night to head to the club where I get my fix of\
  \ my current obsession \u2013 Afrobeats.\n\nBefore I headed to the party that night,\
  \ a friend from the Gambia told me the Malaysian authorities visited his apartment\
  \ in what seems to be a raid to crack down on illegal activities specifically targeting\
  \ certain members of the migrant community. The unpleasant incident made him want\
  \ to leave KL and head home as soon as he could. \n\n\u201CDon\u2019t try to change\
  \ my mind,\u201D he said. I stayed silent knowing that despite my frequent presence\
  \ in the city over the last year, I didn\u2019t know what it was like to live here\
  \ and it was not my place to comment.  \n\nIt was just another one of the familiar\
  \ anecdotes I\u2019ve heard since forming friendships with members of the African\
  \ diaspora in Malaysia and I often wonder why their stories are left untold. \n\n\
  Almost everyone in this club probably has a fascinating story to tell, I thought\
  \ to myself. I sensed a flash going off from the corner of my eye, snapping me out\
  \ of my thoughts. I turned to see the club\u2019s resident photographer pointing\
  \ his device at me. I broke into a smile as we exchanged our usual pleasantries.\
  \ \u201CYou\u2019re back! When did you arrive? How long will you be here?\u201D\
  \ These routine questions made me feel welcome \u2013 I felt like I was coming home\
  \ to a place I belong \u2013 but they were also a reminder of my intermittent time\
  \ in the city.\n\nI needed a breather from the crowd. I put my hookah pipe down\
  \ and made my way to the ladies. I squeezed myself through a line of Asian and African\
  \ women in the washroom. As I stood over the sink washing my hands, the lady next\
  \ to me struck a conversation. Clearly tipsy but coherent, she told me she\u2019\
  s a Somali from Kenya and she\u2019s in Malaysia for her studies. I asked if she\
  \ likes living here and the somehow conversation led to her sharing a sour encounter\
  \ she had at home earlier that day. \n\n\u201CThat happened to my friend today too!\u201D\
  \ I exclaimed, surprised at the coincidence of hearing the same story twice in one\
  \ night. \u201CI\u2019m sorry to hear that happened to you today but I know you\
  \ can overcome this,\u201D I said. She gave me a hug and thanked me. Cupping my\
  \ face, she prayed for my spot in the afterlife before leaving the room. \n\nI don\u2019\
  t remember her name and I doubt I would recognize her if I see her again. But I\
  \ really hope her stories, and that of others, would be heard someday."
