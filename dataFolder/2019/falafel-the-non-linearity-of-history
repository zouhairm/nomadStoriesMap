Text: "In television and in the most traditional newspapers of Brazil there are tips\
  \ on how to maintain a good diet. On Saturdays the squares and public places are\
  \ busiest in the great S\xE3o Paulo because the famous 'fairs' take place. In these\
  \ fairs there is always a merchant selling Acaraj\xE9 which is a gastronomic specialty\
  \ of Afro-Brazilian cuisine: black bean, onion and salt in palm oil. There are several\
  \ ways to serve this dish, with pepper, dry shrimp, etc.\nOne day I went to the\
  \ fair as usual and a very smiling Bahian invited me to eat acaraj\xE9, at the time\
  \ I paid R $ 9.00 and it was very worth it. All that spicy flavor and the organization\
  \ of the dish led me to question the history of this food and all the social practices\
  \ that were behind this dish that emerged in East Africa and that only emerged in\
  \ the Brazilian lands because the African people brought that tradition, that knowledge\
  \ so enriching for Brazilian culture and cuisine.\n\nSoon after experiencing the\
  \ acaraj\xE9 I did some research and discovered that there is a close relationship\
  \ between the Arab Falafel food and the Acaraj\xE9. The text titled \"Origin of\
  \ falafel is motive for the establishment in the Middle East\" of Joseph Orenstein\
  \ describes that:\n\"The bean and chickpeas, common in the Middle East among Coptic\
  \ Christians in Egypt since the 1st century, would have traveled with the Arabs\
  \ through Africa from the 7th century. The Yoruba, who lived in what is now Nigeria,\
  \ Benin, Togo and Cameroon, would have learned to prepare it with the Arabs and\
  \ changed the chickpeas for the black bean-and called acara. Many Yoruba were enslaved\
  \ and brought to Brazil, especially to Bahia. The acar\xE1, of bean-fradinho (hydrated,\
  \ uncooked, like the chickpea of falafel), fried in palm oil, became acaraj\xE9\
  , a symbol of Bahian cuisine.\u201D\n(ORENSTEIN, Jos\xE9).\n\nThere are continuities\
  \ and ruptures over the discourses about what Falafel is, its history, and all the\
  \ ramifications throughout history. To live in Brazil is to make a jump in several\
  \ culinary and, consequently, in plural histories. It is savoring the unknown and\
  \ learning to live, in ordinary social practices, buying a fruit, going to the fair,\
  \ being open to questioning ... In a simple Saturday fair there are several cultures\
  \ and culinary gatherings. That inspires Brazilian citizens to question their history\
  \ and identity. Living in Brazil is exciting."
