Text: "\u201EToday I met my future wife for the first time. For one hour.\u201C said\
  \ Laxman.\n\nBelow us the Phewa lake in Pokhara was glistening in lilac-red evening\
  \ light while Laxman and I were standing barefoot in the garden. He gave me a shaky\
  \ smile obviously trying to convince himself that marrying a girl he had only seen\
  \ once was a really good life decision. \n\n\u201EHow was she?\u201C I asked.\n\n\
  Two weeks ago before I went trekking in the Annapurna mountain range no one was\
  \ talking about a wedding coming up. Yesterday I called to ask if my room was still\
  \ free. The connection was really bad so I understood something like \u201EUntil\
  \ when \u2026 stay? I \u2026 married. You \u2026 invited.\u201C\n\n\u201EWe connected\
  \ well from the first minute.\u201C he said.\n\nOne day later I was sitting on the\
  \ grass in the garden, amidst a group of women all of them dressed in red, pink\
  \ bougainvilleas lying all around us waiting to be crafted into wedding decoration.\
  \ Next to us the men were binding together long pieces of bamboo and palm leaves\
  \ into what should become the altar. Some children were playing at the swing laughing\
  \ joyfully.\n\nWhile my hands made decorations I was trying to make sense of this\
  \ marriage, so I asked Laxman\u2018s older sister Gyanu \u201EWhy did you arrange\
  \ this marriage?\u201C\nGyanu married her husband out of love and lives a western-style\
  \ life in Valencia. She explained \u201ELaxman is 36 years old and the oldest son\
  \ of the family. He never wanted to marry because he never had a girlfriend. But\
  \ he needs to marry. Firstly, because in our culture family is key to everything.\
  \ Secondly, it is about the status we have in our community. A traditional wedding\
  \ is about giving presents to our community: our relatives, friends and neighbours.\
  \ We owe this celebration to them.\u201C\n\nTwo weeks ago the family started searching\
  \ for girls, parents showed up with pictures of their daughters. They tried to match\
  \ class, religion and community to find the perfect partner. A wedding in Nepal\
  \ is not only about two individuals but it means two families merging together.\
  \ Until today the majority of marriages in Nepal are arranged that way. \u201EIt\
  \ will be her,\u201C Laxman said when laying eyes on a picture of a 26 year old\
  \ girl. Her name was Sunshine.\n\nIn the night before the wedding I was lying in\
  \ bed, wondering how Sunshine might feel right now. Tomorrow she would leave her\
  \ family and move to the house of her husband.\n\nThe morning air was fresh and\
  \ golden light flooded over the lake and the blue mountains. The priest and Laxman\
  \ were sitting on the floor in the garden, burning wood, painting red signs on the\
  \ altar, chanting prayers and the priest placed the red tikka (rice mixed with red\
  \ color) on Laxman\u2018s forehead. Slowly about 100 guests started showing up.\
  \ All women were dressed in red and golden saris, the colours of luck and prosperity.\
  \ Gold was shimmering on hairpins, on rings and necklaces. Laxman was sitting in\
  \ the middle of the garden surrounded by gold and red. The guests lined up to gratulate\
  \ by bowing their heads, folding their hands together and placing more tikka on\
  \ his forehead. In return everyone received their gift: a valuable red Sari. \n\
  Afterwards Laxman was leading the whole party to Sunshines house to take her home.\
  \ Laxman and Sunshine stood next to each other, the priest pressing their red-painted\
  \ hands onto a white cloth by this sealing the wedding contract. Their hands were\
  \ shaking slightly while exchanging the rings and looking into each other\u2018\
  s eyes.\n\nThe day after the wedding we were sitting together in the garden, overlooking\
  \ Phewa lake and the mountains once again.\n\u201EIt all depends on how we look\
  \ at things.\u201C Laxman said. \u201EThere are things in life we just have to accept.\
  \ Like my father\u2018s wish that I should marry. The real magic happened when I\
  \ embraced what I could not change. In this moment life surprised me and gave me\
  \ Sunshine.\u201C He paused and looked at his wife smiling \u201EYou!\u201C which\
  \ made her glow with a happy smile."
