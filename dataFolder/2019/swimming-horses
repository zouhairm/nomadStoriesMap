Text: "My mom has a way of ensuring I\u2019ll never forget our vacations. Sometimes\
  \ she books spectacular accommodations with panoramic views but, more often, she\
  \ almost gets us killed. \n\nInitially she had planned the Costa Rica trip as a\
  \ romantic getaway for herself and her partner. Weeks before, Thomas\u2019s fear\
  \ of flying prevailed and I was named his replacement. This in itself was hilarious,\
  \ because she had reserved experiences like romantic torch lit dinners on secluded\
  \ beaches and booked romantic suites complete with private hot tubs and complimentary\
  \ champagne. We bunked in rose petal scattered king beds for the majority of the\
  \ trip, laughing hysterically at strange looks from staff trying to pinpoint our\
  \ relationship. \n\nI loved Santa Teresa the moment we rolled up on its dusty streets.\
  \ The main stretch was peppered with colourful cafes, shops, hostels and motorcycle\
  \ rental stations. Nearly everyone I saw dawned a grin and a bathing suit. The town\
  \ was an embodiment of contentment and relaxation, a small paradise of pristine\
  \ beaches, surf culture, thriving art, fresh cuisine and outrageously friendly people.\
  \ \n\nAfter a few days of ocean side lounging, we grew restless. We found what was\
  \ advertised as a scenic horseback tour around a local ranch, complete with serene\
  \ sunset views from the property\u2019s beach. All we had to do was pick the tour\
  \ guide up on our way because his motorcycle was broken. \n\nCasey hopped into our\
  \ SUV and introduced himself as an American surfer who grew so fond of Santa Teresa\
  \ he moved there. He spent his days shooting surf footage and leading the occasional\
  \ tour. He mentioned that the ranch guide, responsible for tracking landscapes,\
  \ was unable to join us. This meant there might be some minor trial and error around\
  \ which routes to take. No big deal.\n\nMy horse was skittish, but I liked her so\
  \ I didn\u2019t ask for a different one. Her name was L\u2019Amora and she was not\
  \ particularly interested in following any sort of direction. We set out sauntering,\
  \ swatting mosquitos and keeping our distance from roaming bulls. \n\nStumbling\
  \ upon some difficult terrain, our best option was to jump a creek. When it was\
  \ L\u2019Amora turn, she shifted nervously from hoof to hoof, resisting my command.\
  \ She reared up on her hind legs three times, eventually taking the leap but nearly\
  \ bucking me off upon landing. I cackled with relief. Little did I know, it was\
  \ premature. \n\nAfter some revised hillside travel to avoid thick, hungry mud,\
  \ the sea appeared. A setting orange sun gently kissed its rolling waves and a pastel\
  \ sky stretched forever along the horizon. We paused, awestruck. \n\nThen Casey\
  \ saw the shore and let out a disappointed, \u201COh...\u201D. Detours had affected\
  \ our timeline and the tide was wrong. There was no sand, just water beating on\
  \ rock. \u201CThe quickest way back is along the beach,\u201D he said. \u201CWe\
  \ need to take it to get back before dark.\u201D\n\nSo we coaxed our horses into\
  \ torso high water, reassuring them as drifting logs assailed us. The clearing symbolizing\
  \ our path to safety seemed never to come. L\u2019Amora thrashed through pulsing\
  \ waves, leaping and rearing until finally land offered solace from water. I again\
  \ felt relief and it was, again, premature. \n\nCasey noted the sinking sun and\
  \ dangers of riding after dark. At his command, we kicked our horses into full gallop\
  \ and clung tightly to them. All remaining energy was spent on staying mounted.\
  \ Evening enveloped us. We couldn\u2019t see. We had no control. \n\nEventually,\
  \ legs trembling and bodies numb, we reached the stables, said farewell to our steeds\
  \ and drove back to town. I breathed one final sigh of relief, euphoric that there\
  \ were no more horse-related predicaments to endure, and mumbled something about\
  \ how I could use a drink. \n\nWhen we ran into Casey and his family at dinner that\
  \ night, I realized I was fond of him. Sure, he had facilitated one of the most\
  \ terrifying experiences of my life, but I had never felt such accomplishment. I\
  \ wouldn\u2019t trade that advertised relaxing ride for our riveting adventure...\
  \ it\u2019s just another fond addition to the list of ways my mother has almost\
  \ killed me in our travels."
