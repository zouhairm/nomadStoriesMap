Text: "Almost all of the ice was melted except on the top of the mountains and roads\
  \ with long valleys were flourishing in the month of May as I was looking out of\
  \ my window eager to reach our next destination which was Yamunotri. It was a trip\
  \ to Uttarakhand with my parents in which we covered holy Hindu destinations like\
  \ Kedarnath and Badrinath. We reached Yamunotri in the evening. It was super chilly\
  \ in there with the temperature of 0 degree Celsius which was a freezing cold situation\
  \ for me. We decided to visit the temple in the morning. After raining all night,\
  \ finally sun showed up and we began our journey to the temple which was a 13 km\
  \ distance that had to be covered on foot or on ponies. I was so excited for the\
  \ trek and as soon as we started walking, it started to rain again. When we reached\
  \ halfway, my Mom started having trouble breathing because of the low oxygen. After\
  \ some time, even I started feeling sick and we realised that we couldn't go further\
  \ in such situation. We had come so far and it was hard for us to go back without\
  \ visiting the temple. When the temple closes for winter due to snow, Idol of goddess\
  \ Yamuna from the temple is taken to Kharsali village. We decided to visit that\
  \ temple in Kharsali village where they keep this idol during the winter season\
  \ as we couldn't visit the Yamuna temple. \n               As we entered the villiage,\
  \ I saw tiny houses made out of wood and ancient designs of temples which were also\
  \ made of wood. Suddenly I saw a group of children playing in the front of a house.\
  \ They were busy running and laughing while we were trying to find the temple and\
  \ were roaming around in the village. One of the children saw me asking the address\
  \ to a local lady and around in two minutes, I saw all of those kids running towards\
  \ me. Youngest one of them said, \" Come, we'll show you the temple and even the\
  \ entire village. We're gonna take you to our houses in the end, Okay?\". Me and\
  \ my parents smiled and in the next moment those little ones became our tour guides.\
  \ They took us to the temple. They took us through the entire village showing us\
  \ where they keep their food(which was in the small huts made of Sheesham wood)\
  \ during winter. I was jumping, running with them through the grass as if I knew\
  \ them from childhood. Then we went to see the Shiva temple which had a natural\
  \ ground in front of it where boys played Cricket every evening. The most interesting\
  \ part of visiting these places was, We were getting so much of information from\
  \ those kids about each place. We went to the Shani temple, which, was related to\
  \ an interesting story that was told to those children by their grandmothers. That\
  \ temple was built by Pandavas(characters from famous indian epic called \"Mahabharata\"\
  ) and had two vessels in the temple, which, according to stories, interchange their\
  \ position every night of New moon. This temple also has some wordings written on\
  \ the walls which no one has been able to decode till date. These were the stories\
  \ I got to hear from my tiny friends, who also showed us their homes as promised.\
  \ The day ended with them giving me hugs and me noting down their parents' contact\
  \ number in hope of keeping in touch with them. My parents and I had become one\
  \ of them in no time. We said goodbyes and kept waving at each other untill we disappear\
  \ from eyesight.\n               That day I felt really greatful that I didn't get\
  \ to go up the hill. Otherwise I wouldn't have met my most welcoming buddies. Whenever\
  \ I think about that day, it spreads a smile on my face. I'll never forget those\
  \ friends of mine who made me realise that life leads you to even better places\
  \ if you fail to visit one. Those tiny tour guides are always going to be my best\
  \ travel memory."
