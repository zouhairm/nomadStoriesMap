Text: "In my thirties I experienced a shift in my life; loss of a relationship, a\
  \ new job, and a drastic move left me feeling unsteady. I was exiting a stage of\
  \ my life and entering the unknown. When my friend messaged me about going to Mexico,\
  \ it felt the revitalizing breath my story needed to begin this new chapter. So,\
  \ without much thought, I hopped on a plane. \n\nI was robbed within two hours of\
  \ landing. \n\nChaos was creeping up on me again and the panic only dissipated when\
  \ a friendly face smiled at me in the airport and Visa had reassured me everything\
  \ would be fine. That night we settled into our hostel and grabbed cold beers, fresh\
  \ tacos from a stand and had a conversation about why we were both there; finding\
  \ connections in our lives and comradery in the fact that we were both still sorting\
  \ our lives out. \n\nBuilding sand sculptures of elephants and mermaids on the beach\
  \ and a comedic incident with child-sized rain ponchos brought us to the original\
  \ purpose of our trip, our scuba certs. As luck would have it, the day we were scheduled\
  \ to begin our certification a massive storm rolled in. Since we were unable to\
  \ dive that day, the instructor decided to take us on a private tour of some local\
  \ cenotes; taking in this once in a lifetime experience resounded within us. We\
  \ felt the \u201Cwow\u201D reverberate in our chests as we took it all in. Looking\
  \ back on our last few days we realized that every single one of the days we had\
  \ experienced here had each of their own \u201Cwow\u201D moments and from that moment\
  \ on, we choose to set out in search for it daily.\n\nLife was sweet and lived to\
  \ the fullest after that. Our dives bled into nights filled with salsa dancing,\
  \ we followed music into rooms hidden by red curtains and emerged sweaty from dance\
  \ and with a room full of friends, I tasted the best pizza I have ever had in my\
  \ life in Bacalar, stone-cooked by an elderly Italian man before we set off to El\
  \ Canal De Los Piratas for a game of frisbee and music in knee deep warm water.\
  \ A taxi ride across the border to Belize was filled with the crackling voice of\
  \ a man who told us the story of his illegal crossing into the US and his prompt\
  \ return after he was left in the desert to die by gang members. Ancient school\
  \ buses carried us to warm waterfalls, whose worn stones acted like waterslides,\
  \ fry jacks and meat pies became a staple of our diet and exploration the staple\
  \ of our days. There came a moment where each day we wouldn\u2019t even have to\
  \ say anything to each other, we would just look over, with excitement in our eyes\
  \ and know that we had found our \u201Cwow\u201D.\n\nWe reached a day where the\
  \ going had been particularly tough, and we hadn\u2019t had our moment yet. It was\
  \ the end of the Mexican Independence Day and the carnival that had passed through\
  \ town was now taking everything down. Exhausted, we sat down in the park just as\
  \ an old man took out his guitar and started playing love ballads. We looked over\
  \ at each other and smiled. \n\nI\u2019ll never forget the moments of cenotes so\
  \ silent that you could hear your blood pumping or when all you had to do to feel\
  \ like you were drifting through space was to lean your head back in the water and\
  \ look up, or the private tour we received by a gracious mother who took us deep\
  \ into the sacred caves of her family. There she told us of her struggle between\
  \ balancing what was precious to them and their livelihood, the strain between being\
  \ a mother and needing privacy and reaching out to the world to sustain herself.\
  \ That moment made me appreciate the gift we had received there and the gift that\
  \ life really was. \n\nStepping off the plane I felt lighter and knew I had learned\
  \ the secret of gratitude and finding joy in the chapters to come."
