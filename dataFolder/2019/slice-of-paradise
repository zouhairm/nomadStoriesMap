Text: "Two years ago, I traveled to Goa, India, with my then-partner for a much-needed\
  \ break from work. We stayed in Palolem, in the South of Goa, Mecca of tourists\
  \ looking for sun, sand and cold beer. One morning, I was looking for adventure,\
  \ and my partner was hoping to catch a few extra hours of sleep. I rented a motorbike\
  \ from one of the local shops near our cottage and set out on my own. A friend had\
  \ recommended a bar in Palolem, stating that I \"had to go there\". It was a tiny\
  \ place, not well known to the tourists, and played Floyd on a loop. Trouble was,\
  \ she had no idea where it was nor could she remember the name of the place. Armed\
  \ with terrible directions, I took off on my bike, hoping I wouldn't get lost. \n\
  \nI got lost.\n\nI gave up an hour later and decided to go looking for Cola beach.\
  \ I'd overheard some people talking about it at dinner the previous night and since\
  \ my rock bar was lost to me, it seemed logical to head to Cola beach. \nIt's important\
  \ to note here that Google Maps does not work very well in Goa, especially on less\
  \ developed roads. Of course, I was following the Maps. I drove along a kuccha raasta,\
  \ a dirt road, almost fell over a few times, and wondered if I shouldn't just turn\
  \ around and head back to the cottage. Still I was determined to find the beach,\
  \ even if it was only so I could say I had. \nTen minutes later, I received my reward.\
  \ I found myself on the top of a cliff, with a view that made me want to cry. Water\
  \ so blue it hurt the eye to look at, sand so white and untouched by the garbage\
  \ so common on the beaches of North Goa. I stayed there for a while, unable to move,\
  \ drinking in the view, absorbing it and wishing I could live there forever. \n\
  Eventually though, I needed to get closer. I parked the bike at the top, found a\
  \ passable trail and headed down to the beach. At this point, there were a few things\
  \ I knew.\n\nFirst, Cola beach  wasn't known to a lot of people. Second, it was\
  \ a beautiful beach, surrounded by coconut trees. Third, it had an expensive resort\
  \ that was popular with honeymooners. \n\nWhat I didn't know, was that this white\
  \ sand beach was flanked on one side by a sparkling blue sea and on the other, by\
  \ a gorgeous, shining emerald lagoon! \nThere's very few times in life that I have\
  \ been struck dumb. Standing on that sand, the wind in my hair, the waves crashing\
  \ against rocks, all words were lost to me. There was something so moving about\
  \ the ferocity of the sea on one side and the peaceful waters of the lagoon on the\
  \ other. \n \nUsually, I'd go swimming, but the sea was a little rough so I decided\
  \ against it. Instead, I walked along the sand, took a dip in the lagoon and wondered\
  \ if I should go kayaking (nope, too lazy). The resort's bar was set a little higher\
  \ than the beach, so I headed up some steps to it. I ordered a cold beer, put my\
  \ feet up, got out my book and watched the sun go down.\n\nI got lost on my way\
  \ home, but it didn't bother me one bit. The day had been much more than I'd anticipated\
  \ or asked for.\n\nI had gone looking for a bar and found a slice of paradise."
