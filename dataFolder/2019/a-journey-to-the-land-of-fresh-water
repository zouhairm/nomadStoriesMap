Text: "Ahuelican once had a vibrant river that ate men. It flowed in benevolent and\
  \ violent cycles, Teo said to me one season ago. After many children, men, and women\
  \ were lost in this body, a group of villagers drained the lake. The swallowing\
  \ mud-filled roads would be no more. In its wake, German-made cars would eventually\
  \ come to pass.\n\nI met Teo when I visited Ahuelican for Day of the Dead in Mexico.\
  \ Teo is a middle-aged man of an average stature. He\u2019s formed by his glossy\
  \ brown skin and his calloused hands, both rough-yet-crystallized byproducts of\
  \ his labor. Our encounter began with a proclamation: coyotito! The name was inspired\
  \ by the coyote, a nickname my dad made for himself when he lived in the village.\
  \ As the son of the coyote, I naturally became el coyotito to Teo. I responded to\
  \ this new name and asked who he was. \n\n\u201CI knew your father,\u201D he answered.\
  \ \n\nMinutes prior, I had freshly arrived to Iguala, Guerrero from Mexico City,\
  \ the capital of Mexico. I quickly adapted to the midday heat by soaking through\
  \ my three layers of clothing. Thankfully, the main bus terminal was walking distance\
  \ to dozens of taxi drivers eager to pilot at overpriced rates. Before I made it\
  \ to the mob of taxis, Teo struck a conversation with me and offered me a ride back\
  \ to the village. I didn\u2019t want to impose but he insisted it would not be an\
  \ issue. After all, he had already bought groceries for the week with his wife.\
  \ Grateful for his generosity, I obliged and boarded the backseat of his black truck.\
  \ \n\nTeo\u2019s careful and patient wife followed, with Teo ending suit after shutting\
  \ her door. During the ride to Ahuelican, Teo asked me why I had returned. It had\
  \ been almost since my last visit. \u201CI\u2019m here to learn about and visit\
  \ the muertitos (dead) for Day of the Dead,\u201D I said. Upon hearing this, Teo\
  \ face sprung up. His smile produced a brilliance born from his amalgam fillings,\
  \ as he multitasked pushing past his back pocket and reaching for his cellphone.\
  \ After a few short-spurts of fiddling with his phone\u2019s settings, he found\
  \ it. \u201CYou have to see this,\u201D he let out.\n\nThe colors of a cempaxochitl,\
  \ or Mexican marigold, are among the most beautiful I had ever seen. The pedals\
  \ that I saw through Teo\u2019s phone were the color of a sad sun, a deep orange\
  \ with slivers of yellow. Though Teo\u2019s pictures I was provided a landscape\
  \ view of countless rows, each holding uniform weight, each proudly bursting primal\
  \ green leaves, each grounded by brown-but-dry soil. The name, Cempaxochitl, comes\
  \ from Nahuatl\u2014the language of the Aztecs and the most spoken indigenous language\
  \ in Mexico. Literally, it translates to twenty flower. But the real meaning is\
  \ represented through the rituals Cempaxochitl is used in, especially during Day\
  \ of the Dead. These crops, like all life in Ahuelican and its mountains, are fed\
  \ by the seasonal rains that produced lakes. As Teo\u2019s phone retreated, his\
  \ amalgam brace glared again.\n\n\u201CThese crops are being harvested for our rituals,\u201D\
  \ Teo began. \u201CI\u2019ll take you to see them when you\u2019re ready,\u201D\
  \ he said. \u201CI\u2019d like that,\u201D I ended. \n\nTeo and I continued to share\
  \ questions and conversation. In moments of silence, Teo\u2019s mom asked questions\
  \ in Nahuatl, their indigenous tongue. Between these transitions the ride was joined\
  \ by asphalt, winds, and crumbles. Sweat colluded at the ends of my fingers as we\
  \ overcame the countless mountains to arrive to Ahuelican. Unforgiving mudslides\
  \ and flaky boulders had terrorized the dirt roads, while our position in the sky\
  \ preordained deaths of the fallen.\n\nWe eventually abandoned the highway and drifted\
  \ towards the village\u2019s only road. Before reaching the end, Teo broke the stoic\
  \ nature we all had built. He remembered the river. He shared its short origin.\
  \ And to me, his tale illuminated Ahuelican\u2019s ongoing legacy: their relationship\
  \ with the water and the land are changing, but parts of the past remain and continue.\
  \ \n\nWe arrived not too long after. \n\nI shook Teo\u2019s heavy hand and said\
  \ \u201CTlazcamati\u201D (Thank You)\n\nTeo\u2019s amalgam shined back."
