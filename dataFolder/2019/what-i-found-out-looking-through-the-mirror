Text: "I could start to tell a story of how incredible It was when I traveled to Europe\
  \ for the first time. But I won't. I think life itself is already an unexpected\
  \ travel - and that's what makes it great to live. \nWhen I was in high School I\
  \ wouldn't imagine I'd live a hundred lives at the same time in college. And today\
  \ I can say that the college days were the biggest adventured of my life. \nI decided,\
  \ all of a sudden, to study jornalismo, so I could write about everything whenever\
  \ I wanted yo. And I did. I applied and passed the test, got into a great university\
  \ and everything was new.\nAs a studant, I traveled to the fascinating world of\
  \ knowledgement and relationships. I had the chance to get to know authors, movies,\
  \ books, stories, people I didn't expect to see. And everyday, after learning a\
  \ little of the unknown, I would have become a different person. \nMaking knew friends\
  \ after being ignored in high school was the biggest surprise, and also the best\
  \ thing that happened to me. Having people who I can trust in was a whole new level\
  \ of happiness. \nWhen people say that traveling changes who we are, that's true.\
  \ But it doesn't necessarily mean that you have to fly across the globe to discover\
  \ a new self. If you give yourself a little bit of confidence and the chance to\
  \ experience the difference between you and the boy next door, you will see how\
  \ incredible it can be. \nIn college, not I only discovered I wasn't so shy or so\
  \ insecure, but I found out that I am capable of talking to people, making friends,\
  \ falling in love and doing a big presentation in front of the class. I found out\
  \ that I didn't really know myself. \nAnd right now, writing this letter, I see\
  \ that I'm older but still I am learning, but knowing that I can write about whatever\
  \ I want to, if I want to. All I have to do is think about, do research, note everything\
  \ and right. That's it. \nOf course I don't know who I'm going to be tomorrow, but\
  \ today I know I want to write to live a thousand lives and help to change the world,\
  \ because that's what words do."
