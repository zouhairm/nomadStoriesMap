Text: "Gold and silver leaf, eyes of Horus, geometric figures, a diamond necklace,\
  \ a glamorous and elegant brunette\u2014my eyes didn\u2019t know what detail to\
  \ focus on first. I was finally standing in front of the Gustav Klimt's Portrait\
  \ of Adele Bloch-Bauer I nearly moved to tears. The noise of the busy museum faded\
  \ away as I became completely immersed in this painting and imagined I was transported\
  \ back to Klimt\u2019s studio at the turn of the century in Vienna. The portrait\
  \ and the controversy over its rightful ownership is a window into a different era\
  \ and also a painful moment of world history.\n\nMy travel motto is \"the more you\
  \ know about a place, the more you appreciate it\" so I read books, watch movies,\
  \ and listen to music related to my next destination in advance of my trip. Keeping\
  \ this in mind, I brushed up on my Austrian art history before my December 2018\
  \ trip to Vienna. In particular, I became very familiar with Gustav Klimt including\
  \ learning about the controversy surrounding the Portrait of Adele Bloch-Bauer I\
  \ and other paintings owned by Jewish families in Austria in the 1930s and 1940s.\
  \ It was an absolute treat to see some of Klimt\u2019s masterpieces such as The\
  \ Kiss and Judith at the ornate Belvedere Palace in person in Vienna. Their gorgeous\
  \ gold painted mosaic style Klimt is known for as well as the passion you can feel\
  \ in the paintings were remarkable to witness and feel in person. Post-trip I couldn\u2019\
  t stop reading more about the Bloch-Bauer paintings and devoured Anne Marie O\u2019\
  Connor\u2019s book, The Lady in Gold.\n\nLearning that Klimt visited the Byzantine\
  \ gold mosaics of Justinian the Great and Empress Theodora at the Basilica of San\
  \ Vitale in Ravenna shortly before starting work on this portrait helped me clearly\
  \ see its profound influence on him in the Bloch-Bauer portrait. However the most\
  \ interesting part of the story begins after the artist and the subject are both\
  \ long gone. This portrait as well as many other paintings and valuables were seized\
  \ by the Nazis during World War II. The diamond necklace in the painting ended up\
  \ on none other than Hermann Goring's wife's neck. The paintings ended up in the\
  \ Belvedere in Vienna. They erased Adele Bloch-Bauer's identity by calling the painting,\
  \ the Woman in Gold. This beloved painting was unofficially known as the Austrian\
  \ Mona Lisa. After the Art Restitution Act was passed and a lengthy legal battle\
  \ including an appeal up to the United States Supreme Court, the paintings were\
  \ finally returned to the rightful owners, Bloch-Bauer's niece and her relatives\
  \ in the early 2000s. They ended up selling the portrait of their aunt to Ronald\
  \ Lauder and his Neue Galerie in New York City where it remains on display today.\n\
  \nOver the past weekend, I made the trek from my home in the Washington, DC suburbs\
  \ to the Neue Gallerie in Manhattan. I was incredibly moved to visit the portrait\
  \ of the legendary \"Woman in Gold\u201D Adele Bloch-Bauer. I didn\u2019t expect\
  \ to find the culmination of months of learning about Austrian art history in New\
  \ York City, just a few hundred miles from my home."
