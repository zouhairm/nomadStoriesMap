Text: "We opened the train doors to embark on our journey to Laos. \nI had been hesitant\
  \ about this trip, as I was just starting a new relationship and didn\u2019t want\
  \ to leave my new boyfriend alone in Thailand.\nMy sister had convinced me last\
  \ minute that Laos would be a trip of a lifetime and being in Asia and not taking\
  \ advantage of exploring other countries would be a missed opportunity.\n\nAs we\
  \ arrived to Luang Prabang we really didn\u2019t know what to expect, we hadn\u2019\
  t booked a hotel and really didn\u2019t do any research on sightseeing or attractions.\n\
  We asked a tuk tuk driver to take us a hotel nearby the attractions that might have\
  \ availability.\nHe chose a cute little family owned bed and breakfast where they\
  \ had free bikes for guests and breakfast. \nWe immediately chose to stay there\
  \ and decided to ask them what was the best place to visit for travellers in town,\
  \ they said kuang si falls.\nNext Morning, we woke up early and headed to kuang\
  \ si waterfalls and didn\u2019t regret it. It is one of the most magical places\
  \ we have ever been. The jungle, the waterfall and serenity you feel there, it is\
  \ truly unbelievable.\nWe spent the majority of our time riding our bikes exploring\
  \ and eating at local coffee shops, it was truly a wonderful experience.\nOn our\
  \ last day in Luang Prabang my boyfriend called me and decided to end our relationship\
  \ giving the excuse that we had spent too much time apart. \nAs we took the night\
  \ bus back to Vientiane I just wanted to sleep and start another day that didn\u2019\
  t begin with the news of a break up. \nAt 4 in the morning our bus suddenly stopped\
  \ and a commotion of people whispering were getting off the bus in the middle of\
  \ nowhere.\nUnable to understand and confused by the whole situation we decided\
  \ to get off the bus as well.\nOne step off the bus, we soon realised we were on\
  \ top of a mountain in a one-way narrow road and a truck had blocked the entire\
  \ road, no cars could go through so we were all stuck there, with a huge line of\
  \ cars behind.\nOur bus driver told us that we were probably going to be stranded\
  \ for two days until they could get help and solve the problem.\nAll the locals\
  \ decided to get back to their seats and just wait.\nAnother girl traveler from\
  \ Austria that was in the same bus suggested we keep moving and stay together.\n\
  I don\u2019t know if it was because we had united as women travellers or because\
  \ I had just gone through a break up, but there was a sense of safety of girls uniting.\
  \  I felt that if we continued in this path together, it didn\u2019t matter where\
  \ we were headed, we would eventually be okay.\nAfter a while of walking we finally\
  \ made it to the other side where cars where able to move, and a kind tuk tuk driver\
  \ who was delivering groceries saw us walking, and asked if we needed a ride. We\
  \ asked if he could take us to the nearest bus station and he agreed, as long as\
  \ we didn\u2019t mind delivering groceries with him.\nWe sat there in the middle\
  \ of lettuce and vegetables stopping at every grocery store in town, handing out\
  \ the local produce to vendors.\nLooking out, I saw a reflection of myself smiling\
  \ through the rear view mirror. We got to see the most beautiful scenery that you\
  \ mostly miss on buses because of sleep or texting and calling on your phone. We\
  \ got to smell the breeze and witness the beautiful landscape Laos is blessed with\
  \ and we got to witness the kindness of people who just want to help other travellers\
  \ when they are in need. \n\nWe eventually did take a bus to Vientiane and did make\
  \ our flight back to Thailand, but I often think about that magical trip full of\
  \ adventure that I almost missed out on going."
