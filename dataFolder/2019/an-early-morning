Text: "The sun hadn\u2019t woken yet, and neither had I really. I yawned as we walked\
  \ swiftly across the damp cobblestone pavement. The tip of my nose was greeted by\
  \ the cool morning breeze. \n\nLush foliage peeped through the wrought iron fencing\
  \ and I clutched Gavin\u2019s hand a little tighter. It was rare not to hear the\
  \ honking of tuk tuks and inhale the lingering stench of dried cowpats, but I had\
  \ grown to love the uniqueness and chaos of his homeland.\n\nAs we approached the\
  \ entrance, I couldn\u2019t believe how many people were already lined up. I thought\
  \ we were early. The faces of the ticket tellers were stale, clearly unamused by\
  \ the ritual stampede of morning tourists.\n\nWe quickly joined the shortest line.\
  \ I leant over and kissed his cheek. The sun was beginning to rise and I could sense\
  \ his nervousness. He smiled at me \u201CI hope we get in before daybreak, I can\u2019\
  t wait for you to see it.\"\n\nThere was something about this place that had urged\
  \ Gavin to return all these years later, even if it meant an early wake up call.\
  \ He always said that it would mean the world to him to bring me here. Little did\
  \ I know it would soon mean the world to me too.\n\nAfter getting our tickets we\
  \ lined up in single sex queues. I felt hesitant to be separated but was soon distracted\
  \ as I admired the ladies dressed in colourful saris happily chatting away, adorned\
  \ in their golden jewellery. The clanging of their bangles had a charming allure.\
  \ \n\nMy eyes traced Gavin as he zigzagged towards the entrance. I imagined him\
  \ as a young boy, waiting patiently with his father as the crowds towered above\
  \ him. I was intrigued by the imprint this masterpiece had left on him and why he\
  \ felt such affinity with it.\n\nOnce we passed through the metal detectors we were\
  \ reunited and he looked relieved. \n\nI had started to feel nervous, \"what if\
  \ it wasn\u2019t everything I had imagined it to be? What if I feel empty when I\
  \ see it?\" The rhetorical questions lingered as I took a deep breath and smiled\
  \ awkwardly, \u201Cshall we go in?\u201D.\n\nWe shuffled forwards slowly with the\
  \ crowd, crimson brick walls lining the pavement to shield any chance of a premature\
  \ glimpse. I looked down and observed the array of sandals, faded from layers of\
  \ mustard dirt, their leather straps curling at the edges from the dry heat. I thought\
  \ about how many people had made their pilgrimage here to witness one of the world\u2019\
  s wonders. Right in that moment, we turned a corner and I looked up. \n\nIt radiated.\n\
  \nGavin stared at me, oozing with excitement and waiting for my reaction. Overwhelmed,\
  \ my eyes began to well up as he drew me into his chest. He gently kissed my forehead\
  \ and rested his hand on my head. \u201CI\u2019ve never seen something so beautiful\"\
  \ I said. I didn\u2019t know how it was possible.  \n\nI felt an instant and surreal\
  \ connection.\n\nThe morning sunrays had drenched the Taj Mahal and it glistened\
  \ with a champagne glow, exactly how he had described. Its presence was heavenly.\
  \ Masses of majestic white marble, symmetrical domes and meticulously detailed semi-precious\
  \ stones decorated the building. \n\nI was speechless.\n\nWe wandered through the\
  \ immaculately kept grounds before finding a small bench away from the crowds. We\
  \ sat in silence for a while, acknowledging the sheer magnificence of what stood\
  \ in front of us.\n\nGavin then began to tell the love story behind the Taj Mahal\
  \ and why it was so significant to bring me here. To him it represented the epitome\
  \ of never-ending love. \n\nMy palms were sweaty as he reached for my hand. Gracefully,\
  \ he made his way onto one knee and revealed a small black box. In true Gavin style,\
  \ perfectly orchestrated, he asked me to spend forever with him. \n\nSomewhere amidst\
  \ the flurry of tears and exhilaration, I accepted. \n\nA small Indian boy had dared\
  \ to dream of love, and on this day, his dream came true."
