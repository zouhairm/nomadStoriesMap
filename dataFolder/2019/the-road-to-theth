Text: "The front right wheel of the grey 4 by 4 slipped over the side of the gravel\
  \ road. Even though we were surrounded by small trees, and the really steep plummet\
  \ was behind us I still feared that going any further over the side of the road\
  \ would result in disaster. I grabbed the door, and tried my best to act like I\
  \ didn\u2019t just think we would tumble to our deaths. \n\nWe were driving along\
  \ the Rruga Gjecaj to Theth in Northern Albania, the road has astonishing views\
  \ and heart stopping drops. It is also the only road into Theth, and I was determined\
  \ to get there in one piece. I have trouble calling the path we were on a road,\
  \ it was no wider than the 4 by 4 that I was in; it resembled an ATV trail more\
  \ than anything else. To my right I could see a valley etched through the towering\
  \ mountains, some of which were snow tipped. When I made the mistake of looking\
  \ down I saw a vertical drop of mostly rocks and grass. \n\nI was intimidated by\
  \ the thought that I wouldn\u2019t make it to Theth; the first destination in a\
  \ trip that felt like it would define my ability to travel. I did however put faith\
  \ in my driver Zef Carku, and although he occasionally talked on the phone while\
  \ driving, I could tell this was a path he had driven many times before.\n\nI could\
  \ only imagine what my grandfather would say. I knew he would be proud, despite\
  \ the fact that he had insisted I don\u2019t go to Albania as my first solo trip\
  \ abroad. \n\nWhen I arrived in Shkod\xEBr, a small city in Northern Albania, I\
  \ had no idea how I would get to Theth. I decided to ask someone who definitely\
  \ knew the area better than I did \u2013a taxi driver. He couldn\u2019t speak much\
  \ English, so he called his manager who translated for me, and we struck a deal.\
  \ The taxi would bring me to Bog\xEB; a small town at the base of the mountain,\
  \ and then he would help me find a driver to bring me to Theth. \n\nWe drove to\
  \ Bog\xEB with little conversation. The taxi driver stopped at a small concrete\
  \ house that advertised a 4 by 4. The concrete was painted white and there was a\
  \ small patio made of wood with three metal tables and some metal chairs. This is\
  \ where we met Jef; he agreed to take me to Theth and gave me an ice cream cone\
  \ before we set off.  \n\nAt first the road was paved, and could fit two vehicles.\
  \ Before the road turned to gravel we stopped at a small restaurant called Buni\
  \ i Bajra Ktarit. It was where we could take a break before the next part of our\
  \ journey as well as marvel at the mountains. I had never seen a view like what\
  \ I saw in Albania, and looking out from the restaurants patio I felt as if the\
  \ mountains were watching over me, making sure that I completed my journey. \n\n\
  The road beyond the restaurant however turned treacherous, and the steep drop below\
  \ taunted me and gave me doubt. I still took pictures but I had to remind myself\
  \ not to stick my phone out the window where it would hang over the cliffs edge.\
  \ \n\nAfter our too close encounter, we began going downhill where the road was\
  \ surrounded by small trees blooming in the mountain air. The hostel I booked was\
  \ the first house we came across; Zef knew which one it was from the address I gave\
  \ him, which was lucky because I didn\u2019t. He knew the owners too, so they sat\
  \ down and chatted in Italian as I drank a peach Fanta drink that came to be my\
  \ favorite in Albania. \n\nAs I stared out at the hazy mountains beyond the stone\
  \ house that was my hostel I felt proud. I made it to my first destination, and\
  \ I didn\u2019t fall off a cliff. I figured that if I could make it passed that,\
  \ I would get where I needed to go."
