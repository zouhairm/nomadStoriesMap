Text: "When there is something in the heart, mind, or soul worth pursuing the good\
  \ majority of people want it immediately. It\u2019s human nature. Most of us are\
  \ not into delayed gratification. I know I'm not, but there is something to be said\
  \ about waiting.\n\nWhen I first resigned from my teaching job in 2010 because I\
  \ wanted to teach abroad, my family of happily content non-travelers questioned\
  \ why I wasn\u2019t just going back to Australia. The place I studied abroad when\
  \ I was twenty years old. The place I fell head over heels in love with and the\
  \ place that gave me my first taste of real international travel and freedom. But\
  \ I couldn't go back, not yet anyway. The world is big, beautiful and has so many\
  \ incredible people and places waiting to be explored. So what does a girl do? Books\
  \ a TEFL course in Prague and a plane ticket of course. As my year in Europe slowly\
  \ came to a close, I was filled with gratitude but ready to move on. My gut told\
  \ me so. That thing will take you places, if you really listen! \n\nAfter getting\
  \ back home to a serious case of reverse culture shock the desire to finally move\
  \ to Australia started coming on strong. However, just because I was ready to make\
  \ my dream a reality didn\u2019t mean the logistics were also working out. After\
  \ all, what kind of life would it be if everything went to plan. Not only is there\
  \ prep work, paper work and passports, but one of the more fortunate road blocks\
  \ was getting accepted into a Master\u2019s program. Talk about throwing a spanner\
  \ in the works. My dream of getting a higher education meant two more years of study\
  \ until Australia. That didn't sound too appealing, but advancing my life with education\
  \ did. Unfortunately I could not afford a 50k tuition bill. Sadly I thought I was\
  \ going to have to give up on one of my dreams. That is until the light bulb went\
  \ off, or rather I should say, until a good friend switched mine on. She suggested\
  \ I become a research assistant. 'Isn't that for super smart people,' I said quietly\
  \ to myself. Then as fast as I said that, I quickly said something else, 'this position\
  \ is for anyone with sheer determination.' Dead set on becoming a research assistant\
  \ to fund my education was the next vision and I made it happen. With perseverance\
  \ I landed an unheard of amount of research roles. I worked 70 hour work weeks for\
  \ two years. Graduation day finally arrived and so did a working holiday visa to\
  \ Australia!  \n\nI had no idea what was waiting for me on the other side of the\
  \ world. That was four years ago. As I sit here today in my apartment in Melbourne,\
  \ Australia writing this piece, I am overcome with the realisation that it is for\
  \ two new dreams. My passion for sharing experiences and Portugal. \n\nIs there\
  \ something you want to do or have? Something you\u2019ve thought about, dreamt\
  \ about, or are waiting for? Take actions toward making it happen, but don\u2019\
  t force anything. Let it unfold organically. It may take a day, two weeks, three\
  \ months, or in my case, years. Keep working for your dream and don\u2019t let it\
  \ pass you by. It will happen and It will be worth it!"
