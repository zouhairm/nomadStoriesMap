Text: "On a rainy July afternoon, we landed in front of a large stone arch adorned\
  \ with dragons and men in battle position, we had decided to leave China and discover\
  \ what Vietnam could offer us. The border was in a large mountainous area with no\
  \ population in sight. The statue of a buffalo-driven cannon, propelled by soldiers,\
  \ was synonymous that we were in an ancient battle zone. At six and forty-five,\
  \ with the last rays of light looming over the horizon, the patriotic colors of\
  \ both flags waved haughty before saying goodbye. \n\nIn the Vietnamese migration\
  \ office, a kind man in an olive-colored military suit asked us for the visa, we\
  \ didn't have it. \"I cannot let you pass,\" he said. In a reading error we had\
  \ confused our possibilities; the sharp needles of the news punctured our bodies,\
  \ driving through our skin as fierce jaws of hundreds of hungry fish. We were in\
  \ no man's land, neither in China nor in Vietnam, resigned in the midst of that\
  \ deserted Esplanade where thirty eight years ago, about ninety thousand Chinese\
  \ soldiers had attacked by three fronts the Vietnamese north, so expectant how they\
  \ surely would be, beating our spirits against the uncertainty of the future. \n\
  \nWe only had to go back to China, wait for our passport to have the permission\
  \ to enter again, just after thirty minutes of the departure, we did not know. We\
  \ walked in silence, observing as the arrival of the night shadowed that statue\
  \ of buffaloes, cannons and warriors, that ironic was presented as a solitary witness\
  \ that we also battled against what life offered us. On Amanda's cheek, a sad, disconsolate\
  \ tear descended into the dark pavement. In her I could clearly read her despair\
  \ and her anguish, what are we going to do, Ezekiel? She asked. I didn't answer.\n\
  \nIn front of the gateway to Chinese migration, the unimaginable happened; the time\
  \ of admission had expired. Without any possibility of entering any of the two territories,\
  \ our options were reduced to nothing; the greatest fear of any traveler was clambered\
  \ and stood before us, which enemy staunch of our destiny, foreigners without permission\
  \ of entry, in the midst of unknown countries.  \n\nBut the most important thing\
  \ in life is to struggle in the face of difficult situations. Despite the risk of\
  \ deportation, or confinement in a prison for finding us without legal documents\
  \ in an old conflict zone, we had to find a secluded space on that dividing line\
  \ of political ideas and camp until the next day. With our lighted lanterns we took\
  \ in the direction of that commemorative monument of the war episode, which to the\
  \ contrast of the lights that came out of our fronts, made that the men who propelled\
  \ the cannon and the buffalo that bleated by the effort take life again. In observing\
  \ them I could truly feel their flesh and soul heading for the zone of death. Like\
  \ us, they were also travelers in the lands of our planet, but they were traveling\
  \ for a different cause, they were doing it for a conflict. I thanked the life that\
  \ in opposition to them, we could travel by friendship and rejoicing, although monument\
  \ in honor of it did not exist yet. Another tear fell on the pavement, this time\
  \ it was mine."
