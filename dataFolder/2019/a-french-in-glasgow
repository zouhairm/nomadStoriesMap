Text: "I was, despite having timed my day to the minute, running late for my appointment\
  \ at \u2018The Clydeside Distillery\u2019 in Glasgow. The sun had half melted into\
  \ River Clyde, and the pigeons were making their way home. I saw one jogger, in\
  \ neon pink shoes, jog past me down the waterfront, past the rugged facade of Riverside\
  \ Museum, then the awkward slant of Clyde Arc, and only when she turned out of sight,\
  \ I could see the Clydeside Distillery humming on the horizon. \n   With the jogging\
  \ lady gone, I had nothing else to do but reflect upon the \u201Cincident\u201D\
  .  As alien as it seemed now, it was only last night that I\u2019d met this girl\
  \ at \u2018Potstill\u2019, a whisky-house right in the middle of Glasgow. \n   I\
  \ was learning to swirl my glass of whiskey, which took a few trials to get it right.\
  \ \n   Once, I swirled it so hard that quite a bit plopped out of the glass. I was\
  \ duly shamed for it by three old folks sitting in the opposite corner. They looked\
  \ quite comfortable in the discomfort caused by their huge bellies and stiff-thin\
  \ legs. They must\u2019ve been pals for ages, for they hadn\u2019t much to talk\
  \ about amongst themselves. Instead, they looked at naive outsiders like me, and\
  \ made fun of our \u2018wannabe\u2019 ways of swirling whiskey. \n   I quickly busied\
  \ myself with observing the most ideal-looking couple in the bar. The man must\u2019\
  ve been 6\u20192, wide-jawed, narrow-nosed, caramel-haired. The woman 5\u201911,\
  \ round-faced,  blue-eyed, straight-haired. Had I been him, I\u2019d be making love,\
  \ and swirling whiskey would\u2019ve been a pointless deed.\n   I was just about\
  \ perfecting my swirl when I saw another girl walk in through the door. Her swaying\
  \ legs said exactly how drunk she was. \u201CVery,\u201D was the word. She was followed\
  \ by two strong guys. With a divorce-lawyerish eye for details, I could tell that\
  \ one of them was her boyfriend. The girl, unbothered by onlookers, came upstairs\
  \ and found a place at the corner adjacent to me, while her boyfriends dutifully\
  \ queued up at the bar. \n   I swirled my whiskey again, sunk my nose deep, inhaled\
  \ the smokey flavours, dipped my tongue, and before I could savour it in, the girl\
  \ had crept in besides me. Any closer and I\u2019d officially be calling it an affair.\n\
  \u201CWhat\u2019s your name?\u201D she rumbled, in complete drunkenness.\nI told\
  \ her my name.\n\u201CYou\u2019re a very good looking guy.\u201D she said, not really\
  \ meaning it.\nI thanked her. Shamelessly. \n\u201CAre you from around here?\u201D\
  \ she asked.\nFrom India. Studying in London.\nWhat are you doing here? deeply exaggerating\
  \ every word.\nI told her I was tripping around the UK.\nBy yourself? She looked\
  \ really surprised. Not exaggerating, she was  genuinely surprised.\nI did not know\
  \ how to respond, but I managed a nod, \u201CYes, by myself\u201D.\nShe pitied me.\
  \ I pitied her.\n   The boyfriends came through, and with a gentlemanly show of\
  \ hand, one of them apologized for his girlfriend\u2019s misbehaviour.\n\n   Her\
  \ misbehaviour- made me realize I\u2019d gone \u201Cby myself\u201D for so long\
  \ that I\u2019d actually started feeling lonely. Friendship had as if become an\
  \ unknown territory, that I\u2019d lost way to.\n\n   I reached the Clydeside Distillery\
  \ ten minutes before time. I must\u2019ve rushed. I was welcomed by an old man,\
  \ dark and bald, with a jazz musician\u2019s charm about him. I assumed from his\
  \ crumpled uniform that he was the doorman. He ushered me into a cafe and asked\
  \ me to take a seat. Ten minutes passed quickly. The old man came back and asked\
  \ me to follow him. I was prepared to be handed over to a guide. But I stood corrected.\
  \ The old man was the guide. We reached a small room turned into mini-theatre. Two\
  \ benches lay side by side. On one of which I took rest. On the other, sat another\
  \ young man, curly hair and a hunch of humbleness on his back.\n   I sheepishly\
  \ kept looking at him from the corner of my eye. Our eyes met, and the inevitable\
  \ followed, we engaged in awkward half-smiles. I asked him, for I did not know where\
  \ else to begin, where he was from. \u201CFrance,\u201D he said, \u201Cand you?\u201D\
  \ The ice was broken."
