Text: "The Cemetery seemed like a city in its own, with an imposing gate, the pathways\
  \ between the graves that could be considered small roads, the tombs which could\
  \ be the monuments. Some were modern, some old, some abandoned, and some worshiped.\n\
  \ A graveyard is not the most common place for a tourist to go due to its morbid\
  \ aspect, but the First Cemetery of Athens holds great relevance to the city's identity.\
  \ As a Greek culture enthusiast, I just had to get there. Little did I know that\
  \ there was much more behind that location.\n During the breezy autumn, I left the\
  \ Syntagma Square and endured a steep hike of 15 minutes. Farther back the Panathenaic\
  \ Stadium, I came to find the main entrance that was set at the top end of Anapafseos\
  \ (Eternal Rest) Street, on the Mets Hill.\n Eventually, I reached my destination.\n\
  \ Being alone in the site of the dead did not seem macabre. Luxurious memorials\
  \ erected by talented sculptors cover the large area. This special location exudes\
  \ a white aura that can be attributed to the use of marble.\n The masterpieces transcend\
  \ beyond the landfills and typical crosses. Indeed, various artistic currents can\
  \ be appreciated in the collection.\n Taking a stroll around the burial ground,\
  \ it may feel like a visit to an open-air museum. That is quite true, as it constitutes\
  \ the largest sculptural park in the country and one of the largest throughout Europe.\n\
  \ Around St. Lazarus, the oldest church in the resting place, some tombs date back\
  \ to 1837. Among the thousands of graves, lie distinguished statesmen, politicians,\
  \ military leaders, revolutionaries, philanthropists, academics, actors, directors,\
  \ composers, singers, archaeologists, and writers.\n There are tombstones, temples,\
  \ busts, entire statues, many sleeping or lying down, some displaying a state of\
  \ contemplation or lament. It is noticeable that the artists created freely, even\
  \ occasionally adding sensual and erotic elements.\n The citizens, influenced by\
  \ the traditions of Ancient Athens, integrated patterns, motifs, symbols, and columns.\
  \ Consequently, considerable sums of money were spent.\n Family competitions for\
  \ the best memorial resulted in the impressive sculptures I was able to admire.\
  \ They provide an appealing glimpse into the history of this Mediterranean country,\
  \ from the 19th century through the present day.\n Aimlessly exploring the site\
  \ oxygenated by tens of trees, I came across, now I know, the most famous piece\
  \ in the cemetery. The Sleeping Girl portraits Sophia Afentakis. What caught my\
  \ eye was the realistic detail and expressiveness.\n The face of the sculpture is\
  \ calm, as if in an eternal dreamless sleep. The girl is dressed with a nightgown\
  \ carefully clipped up to the chest. Her hands seem to be alive while she is covered\
  \ with a bed sheet.\n Her hair is loose and her legs restlessly folded. Only the\
  \ cross that she holds in her hands is a sign that Sofia is not resting, but actually\
  \ dead.\n A few meters from where I was standing it begun a process of disinterment\
  \ that drove me out of my contemplation. I had never heard of such a thing, but\
  \ the process proves to be necessary since cremation is not allowed by the Greek\
  \ Orthodox Church.\n There is not enough capacity to bury everybody separately,\
  \ despite several extensions of the limits of the graveyard. After a number of years,\
  \ the deceased is dug up, the bones put in a box, and then moved to the ossuary\
  \ in the Plaza.\n Because of this situation, it can be concluded that the cemetery\
  \ is a living space that changes day by day.\n As the official closing time is 5\
  \ PM, I decided to put an end to my personal tour coated in a peaceful and relaxed\
  \ atmosphere when the clock struck 4.30 PM.\n The experience led to major reflexions.\n\
  \ The First Cemetery is a cultural heritage treasure not known to the public, perhaps\
  \ because people want to have the perception that death is \"distant from me\".\n\
  \ As for myself, I have understood how the study of the cemeteries contributes to\
  \ the reconstruction of fundamental aspects of previous societies.\n In Greek, the\
  \ words for monument (mnimeio) and tomb (mnima) both come from the word memory,\
  \ making burial grounds a place where continuity is present."
