Text: "Time machines are not only 'science fiction' - there are 'portals' in this\
  \ world that can transport us into the past. And in the case of Portugal this is\
  \ a past, full with flair, opulence & majesty. From the cities of Lisbon and Porto,\
  \ bathed in voluptuous luxury, to the Algarve, a stretch of beaches and towns along\
  \ the coast, we wander wide-eyed, imagining possible previous lives when we too\
  \ were proud to be a part of this burgeoning empire. Yes, kingdoms eventually do\
  \ crumble, yet here we find the spoils remain, waiting to luxuriantly lavish us\
  \ with a surplus of sensual satisfaction. The Azores will dazzle you with whales,\
  \ hot mineral springs and curious coastal towns. Evora will transport you back 2000yrs.\
  \ to the times of the Roman empire. Madeira, the 'Floating Garden of the Atlantic',\
  \ is ready and waiting to tantalize you with orchids and fine wines, with Laurissilva\
  \ Forest, harboring the world\u2019s largest concentration of laurel. Algarve presents\
  \ a backdrop waiting for the artist in you to paint pictures of your visit, with\
  \ stunning rock formations jutting from the golden beaches and azure waters; summer\
  \ resorts surrounded with olive and orange groves. Lest we not forget Lisbon, where\
  \ Tram28 awaits you, anticipating your eagerness to see & taste alluring alleys\
  \ doused in warm afternoon sunlight, a maze of cobblestone streets in the Moorish\
  \ quarter, eventually arriving at St. George's Castle, in the midst of arcadian\
  \ archi-texture. Obidos will lead you through her labyrinth of streets of stone,\
  \ where fragrant flowers assault you with their riot of colours all the more since\
  \ they stand out in contrast to the white-washed walls of the houses. Sintra, snuggled\
  \ in the low hills that grow into the Sintra Mountains on Lisbon's coast, will transport\
  \ you back almost 300 yrs. where you find yourself rubbing shoulders with the Portuguese\
  \ royal family in Pena's Palace, surrounded by exotic plants, trees and flowers.\
  \ The ancient ruins of the Castle of the Moors crowning the city\u2019s highest\
  \ hill, and the romantic Monserrate Palace with its subtropical gardens vie with\
  \ the Pena's. Coimbra is eager to increase your knowledge as she is home to one\
  \ of Europe's oldest universities and the magnificent Joanina Library. Aveiro will\
  \ charm you with her scenic canals, colourful bridges and charming gondolas as she\
  \ is known as 'the Venice of Portugal'. Her beaches will gently lull you into a\
  \ state of relaxation. When it's time to explore again, there is no dearth of architectural\
  \ wonders overflowing with art, to transport you to newer & older destinations,\
  \ as you may prefer. Porto invites you next, famous for its production of fine port\
  \ wine, the busy city of Porto sprawls along the hills overlooking the Douro River\
  \ in northern Portugal. At the heart of Porto is the charming pedestrian zone, the\
  \ Ribeira, an atmospheric place on the river, buzzing in live music, cafes, restaurants\
  \ and street vendors. Dominating this popular tourist setting is the Ponte Dom Luis,\
  \ a metal, double-deck arch bridge that links Porto to Vila Nova de Gaia, well-known\
  \ for its port wine cellars.  \nOn a day trip from Lisbon, you can see Sintra and\
  \ Cascais, filling the journey with coastal vistas, stunning mountains, castles\
  \ and surfers.\nSintra is unique because it boasts world-class scenery and landscapes\
  \ as well as medieval palaces and lavish estate homes from more recent times. A\
  \ walk along the trails of Pena Park will bring you to the Pena National Palace,\
  \ at the top of Sintra Mountain. Its 19th century design is the epitome of lavish\
  \ decor. Next is Sintra National Park and the Palace of Monserrate. At the national\
  \ park, you\u2019ll stand next to Cabo da Roca, the rocky bluff that also serves\
  \ as Europe\u2019s westernmost spot. Watch local surfers catching waves at Guincho\
  \ Beach, and then make your way to Cascais.\nThe small coastal town of Cascais is\
  \ the ultimate place to stroll barefoot in the sand, watching the waves roll in\
  \ on the shore of this traditional Portuguese fishing village. The iconic white\
  \ houses with terra-cotta roofs will become etched in your memory. Along the journey\
  \ back to Lisbon, enjoy pristine views of the scenic town of Estoril."
