Text: "My three days in Vienna, Austria was equivalent to three days in Hell. I arrived,\
  \ only to realize that my outbound flight awaited in Warsaw, Poland. There I sat\
  \ at the airport McDonald\u2019s, near breakdown with my 6-piece McNuggets and sweet\
  \ n\u2019 sour sauce. The scrumptious goodness that had fed me in the prime moments\
  \ of my childhood brought no comfort, only the taste of fried grease and salty tears.\
  \ \n\nBut you can get lucky in Hell. Between tear-blurred vision and soggy chicken\
  \ nuggets, one can find a direct flight to Poland leaving in two days for about\
  \ $35. \n\nLife moves on. I left for the store, $35 short - meaning, no room in\
  \ the wallet to eat out. At SPAR, cold locals and freezing tourists huddled after\
  \ Christmas, excusing each other to grab tonight\u2019s dinner from emptying shelves.\
  \ The line stretched far beyond short, hugging each corner of the store, serving\
  \ as the extra barrier shoppers did not need. From awaiting checkout, only one lady\
  \ remains ingrained in my memory four months later. I remember her because of her\
  \ face. And I remember her face because of her makeup. Tightly sharpie-d brows,\
  \ layers of white cake on flawless skin, paleness given bold color with hot pink\
  \ blush. Her look was finished with cropped fur as outerwear, and more fur for head\
  \ warmth. She wasn\u2019t there to do groceries, but her spouse was. Still with\
  \ purpose, she stood proud - and I admired from afar, a couple feet away. \n\nI\
  \ paid for my groceries. Ate my evening meal on a bench. My phone had died, but\
  \ I stumbled upon a Christmas market by ear. Tis the season, it was the last day.\
  \ I turned down wine from a heart-shaped mug (that you can keep) for some spiced\
  \ hot chocolate. Overpriced, but sometimes you don\u2019t pay for the drink - you\
  \ pay for the comfort, the warmth it brings in new territory. Went into a photo-booth\
  \ by myself, a check off the bucket list. With numbing fingers, I journaled about\
  \ how I had overcome Hell this morning. \n\nMeanwhile, Hell awaited at my hostel.\
  \ \n\nHell was that darn essay I had to finish for class...or so I thought. There\
  \ I sat, unmotivated to revisit academia in the lobby. There I fell asleep, only\
  \ to wake up to a stolen wallet from my fanny pack. Hell came crumbling. The leftovers\
  \ from SPAR became my next remaining meals. A free drink voucher, my breakfast for\
  \ the next morning. My phone - its camera - my only source of comfort. A couple\
  \ US dollars I would later exchange for a couple less Euros at the bank. My passport\
  \ and California Driver\u2019s License, my identity, my only ticket out. \n\n---\n\
  \nThe morning of the 28th, I left the hostel with my guard up. With time to spare,\
  \ I strolled the market outside Wombat\u2019s Hostel on my way to the station. Waiting\
  \ for me was a vendor and his jewelry stand. A conglomeration of everything from\
  \ pendants to bags, sourced from everywhere from Egypt to Southeast Asia. My eyes\
  \ interlocked with a pendant, refusing to unpeel. That was enough to instigate a\
  \ haggle. \n\nThe vendor asked me about the American Dream. We talked immigration,\
  \ money, success, purpose. But mostly, we talked love - the crossing of paths, the\
  \ law of attraction, coincidences. He mentioned Jimi Hendrix and long fingers, I\
  \ responded with my expired dream of violin and music school. I mentioned my love\
  \ story with a drummer I met at a festival. He responded, \u201CYou remind me of\
  \ my daughter.\u201D She met a violinist in Korea, who took to Vienna to extend\
  \ his musical career (and love life). We talked coincidences again, the interlinking\
  \ of mutual forces in one space, one matter. Before departing, he told me I spoke\
  \ from my heart, to do something with that voice. \u201CShare your stories, just\
  \ as you\u2019ve done today. Success will follow.\u201D And here I am doing just\
  \ as he suggested, awaiting success - but more importantly, doing what I love. We\
  \ said our goodbyes. \n\nI missed the last train to the airport. Our paths crossed\
  \ a couple minutes too long. But, at least I found an angel in Hell. His name was\
  \ Magd\u0119 (pronounced: Magdee) Charango."
