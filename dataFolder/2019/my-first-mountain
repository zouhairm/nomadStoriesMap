Text: "I don\u2019t make a habit of getting up at 1am. Especially not on holiday.\
  \ What makes it worse is that I\u2019ve only had three hours sleep, on the wooden\
  \ floor of a cabin packed with 100 strangers. Fingers of cold reach between the\
  \ floorboards and tickle my back, but it\u2019s the yelling that wakes me. The words\
  \ are Japanese, but there\u2019s no mistaking what they mean. It\u2019s time to\
  \ start the final leg of our climb to the summit of Mount Fuji.\n\nIt was hard enough\
  \ getting here, hachi-go-me, or \u201Cthe 8th station\u201D. For a few thousand\
  \ yen you can get a hot meal and sand-filled pillow in what you could generously\
  \ call a dorm. The guides I\u2019d read suggested it was a good way to break up\
  \ your climb, recouping some strength two-thirds of the way.\n\nTrue as this may\
  \ be, the guides are written by the kind of people who climb mountains. I am not\
  \ one of those people. This was my first mountain. And the preparation had given\
  \ me a sense of confidence I would discover I didn\u2019t deserve. \n\nThe climb\
  \ began from the fifth station, already 2300 metres above sea level. Devouring soft,\
  \ salty gyoza dumplings from the cheery (if spartan) canteen, I\u2019d thought it\
  \ curious that all the building there had sprung floors. It was only outside on\
  \ the tarmac I realised that the unsettling sensation of being on a boat was caused\
  \ by the altitude. \n\nThe Yoshida trail, the most popular of the four routes, started\
  \ gently. Its wide gravel path had a forgiving incline with breathtaking views over\
  \ the patchwork countryside below, or that could just be the thinning air.\n\nPlodding\
  \ upwards, I was passed by scores of intrepid octogenarians, their parkas zipped\
  \ tight around their weatherbeaten features, hollering \u201Cganbate\u201D (good\
  \ luck). The August heat may have been pushing 40 degrees down in the city, but\
  \ above the clouds it was getting closer to zero. \n\nAs the temperature dropped,\
  \ the light faded and the going got steeper. Walking turned to hiking turned to\
  \ scrambling. At one point, the path led to a sheer rock face painted with a white\
  \ arrow, as if I couldn\u2019t work out the only way was up.\n\nIt took me more\
  \ than 6 hours of grappling to reach the mountain hut. The nap and plate of hot\
  \ curry was much needed, but from the 8th station it\u2019s a further 3 hours to\
  \ ascend the last 500 metres.The plan is to make the summit for dawn, hence the\
  \ 1am start. And everyone else has the same idea. \n\nA glittering snake stretches\
  \ down the pitch dark mountainside, made of hundreds of torches. Conditions have\
  \ become even more hostile now, as though the elements have decided we\u2019re trespassers.\
  \ The wind comes in gusts cold enough to cut like samurai swords, and strong strong\
  \ enough that they threaten to shove me over the edge, to tumble like the loose\
  \ volcanic stones beneath our feet.\n\nI pass a girl doubled over with altitude\
  \ sickness, one of many. \u201CBut we\u2019ve made it this far\u201D I hear her\
  \ utter through gritted, chattering teeth. My sentiments exactly. \n\nAs the blood\
  \ orange sun peeks over the horizon, setting fire to the landscape, its rays cast\
  \ a gold light on the tori gate that marks the beginning of the holy summit. Finally.\n\
  \nIt\u2019s cliche to say that the top is otherworldly, but the craggy, pebbledashed\
  \ ground is all shades of grey, and the path loops around the gaping crater in the\
  \ middle that looks like it could swallow a weary climber.\n\nThe weirdest part\
  \ is the vending machines \u2013 testament to the ubiquity of Japans convenience\
  \ culture. I may be 3776 metres up, but I can still get hot coffee in a can. It\u2019\
  s the best thing I\u2019ve ever drunk. \n\nI get in the queue to use the highest\
  \ bathroom in all Japan, bringing relief in all senses. I made it. These are the\
  \ words of silent camaraderie on the faces of other climbers as we exchange jubilant,\
  \ bloodshot glances. \n\nThere\u2019s a proverb that says, a wise man climbs Mount\
  \ Fuji once, a fool climbs it twice. \nCall me a fool, because I know I\u2019ll\
  \ be back."
