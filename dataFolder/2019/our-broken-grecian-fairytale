Text: "Europe to me held a certain nostalgia. My boyfriend and I had spent several\
  \ weeks in the Winter throughout Germany and Netherlands, and it wasn\u2019t just\
  \ the memories that felt like ours. The entire essence of Europe\u2019s fairytale\
  \ winter just, belonged to us. Trekking through thick snow in Prague with 5 layers\
  \ of barely adequate clothing and suitcases that struggled to move, becoming wildly\
  \ drunk off cheap beer in Munich, and watching the year roll over in the center\
  \ of Amsterdam\u2019s celebrations, the Winter of 2016 in Europe became completely\
  \ ours. \n\nWe left and we broke up. Those memories slowly fade, but by the time\
  \ 2017\u2019s winter rolled over I still felt betrayed by the fact that the previous\
  \ one had not become frozen for me to keep forever. \n\n\nNow i\u2019m 20, vibrant,\
  \ and only slightly naive. I have a ticket to Athens in hand, and a best friend\
  \ awaiting my arrival. Over a month of backpacking Europe planned, and under 2 weeks\
  \ of accommodation and flights sorted. The spontaneity required to survive the next\
  \ 5 weeks has me, thrilled. It\u2019s Summer and no longer the Europe I know. \n\
  \nThis Europe belongs to me and Ellen. The Greek islands were destined to be our\
  \ paradise of a playground. \n\n\nWhen my 30 hour journey finally lands me in Athens,\
  \ my phone dies and I struggle to find my way to meet her. With darkness setting\
  \ in the sky I get on the first train in the station, decipher the Latin alphabet\
  \ to guess where I get off, and we are miraculously reunited. After a long year\
  \ apart, our reunion sets off a streak of over excited behavior. \n\nWe talk in\
  \ fake accents and made up languages. As we dance through the aged and dirty streets,\
  \ Ellen tells me that Athens is the least, \u2018European - looking\u2019, place\
  \ she\u2019s visited this Summer. I agree that it doesn\u2019t have the same charm\
  \ as the Winter cities I\u2019ve seen, but the allure of the upcoming Greek Islands\
  \ has us completely enchanted. \n\nSeveral days after arriving in Athens, we\u2019\
  re on our way to Santorini. We board the ferry in a whirlwind and euphoria rushes\
  \ through us 8 hours later as we get our first glance of the island. We are in bliss.\
  \ As we later spend our days sweating, hiking, singing and drinking, we realize\
  \ we love it. 20 years old and roaming the Greek Islands, we are in love with our\
  \ lives and the beauty that is in it. We are young and in paradise, and completely\
  \ carried away with our freedom. \n\nSo the sky is stained with sunsets each night,\
  \ and they\u2019re spectacular. Pinks and blues coat your every glance. The rich\
  \ ocean sweeps under the horizon, and the sky is as large as it will ever be. Crocuses\
  \ bloom above our heads as we wander the narrow, cobblestone paths in each Island,\
  \ and every quaint bar beckons for our entry. Santorini is a sweaty flurry of photos.\
  \ Ios is a blur of bar crawls. Paros is homely, warm and authentic. \n\nMykonos\
  \ arrives, and our spirits have gone mental. The beach resort we are staying at\
  \ hosts many groups of tourists and proudly presents a line of clubs only steps\
  \ away from the sand. Ellen and I look at each other, and decide that 3pm is the\
  \ perfect time for some, \u2018quiet\u2019 drinks before a beach party. That means\
  \ a bottle of Malibu down in an hour.\n\nStumbling in to Mykonos\u2019s iconic outdoor\
  \ beach club, we see the stars of the northern hemisphere and the blue, Greek ocean\
  \ we had come to love. But the view is better from a table. And the music requires\
  \ dancing to. And someone\u2019s giving us a handful of shots. \n\nTrekking through\
  \ unbearable heat in Santorini, becoming wildly drunk off Ouzo in Ios, and dancing\
  \ in the center of the tourists celebrating nothing in particular at all, the Summer\
  \ of 2018 in Greece was absolutely ours. I didn\u2019t find the love I did in Winter,\
  \ but I certainly didn\u2019t expect to find my broken bones collapsed pathetically,\
  \ over the floor, beneath the table, of the beach club in Mykonos. \n\nNeedless\
  \ to say, that was the end of my trip."
