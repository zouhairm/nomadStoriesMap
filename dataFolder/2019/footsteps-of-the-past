Text: "Walking through the cobblestone path in Old Jerusalem, I could not comprehend\
  \ the historical significance of the ground we were walking upon. I was ignorant\
  \ of the historical weight this holy ground had, being the apex of three global\
  \ religions and the cause for warfare, strife, and countless deaths. Who was I to\
  \ truly grasp its importance, a naive girl from Hawaii, who had not even heard of\
  \ Israel until attending college?\n\nIt was on my first day in college where I met\
  \ my best friend who grew up in Tel Aviv in a Jewish family. Having moved to the\
  \ states at a young age, this was her family\u2019s pilgrimage home and one in which\
  \ I was honored to be invited to partake in. However, despite being best friends\
  \ for years and learning the history of Israel in my courses, I was unable to entirely\
  \ grasp the significance of this land.\n\nThis was until we took a wrong turn in\
  \ the old city.\n\nWe had gotten lost in the footsteps of the past. The ancient\
  \ buildings and the tight, winding pathways all looked the same to me. At the time,\
  \ I did not feel the danger that my hosts felt deep within them. Within a second\
  \ after realizing that we had wandered into the Muslim quarter of Old Jerusalem,\
  \ my host\u2019s demeanor shifted, from a blissful feeling of home to one of dread.\n\
  \nThere was a heavy stillness in the air as if the city itself was holding its breath,\
  \ feeling the tense anxiety caused by the two religions encountering one another.\
  \ It was within these moments, as we scurried away as if racing from the past to\
  \ the present, that I realized we were not merely making a pilgrimage.\n\nWe were\
  \ not simply visiting the homelands of her people where historic events took place.\
  \ This was not just history but this was alive within the people who feel Jerusalem\
  \ calling them home. The fear within my hosts was a stark wake up to the reality\
  \ of the complicated past and present life of Jerusalem.\n\nDespite what strides\
  \ may be taken to resolve the conflict in Israel and Jerusalem, the harsh reality\
  \ of the terror ingrained within the people who call it home makes the idea of peace\
  \ for the foreseeable future simply that; an idea."
