Text: 'It was towards the end of my trip. Since I was pretty tired, I opted to use
  Uber instead of public transit for my ride to the Salzburg Airport. And that is
  when I met Andreas, my taxi driver. We started chatting immediately. It was as we
  were old friends, catching up. I can''t even recall the details of what we talked
  about. All I remember was that it was a very pleasant conversation.


  Then an interesting song came on through the speakers. It was a song that I had
  never heard before but it was quite catchy. He told me it was called "I Like Chopin"
  and it was a very popular song in the 80''s. I Wikipedia''d it and it actually came
  out in 1983, one year after I was born. While it was very popular in Europe, it
  never crossed over to the US. I can still remember enjoying the song with the windows
  down, breathing in the crisp, mountain air, not wanting to be anywhere else in the
  world at that moment.


  When I got home, I searched for the song on Spotify and listened to it on repeat.
  Every now and then, I''ll listen to the song and reminisce. I''m instantly transported
  back to that wonderful taxi ride, where two humans from different parts of the world
  bonded for a brief moment in time over Chopin, in the birthplace of Mozart.'
