Text: "The most harrowing part of quitting my job and travelling alone to a foreign,\
  \ beautiful country was the simple fact that I was one of approximately 8.2 million\
  \ Australians who go abroad each year. \n\nI felt as though I had spent the last\
  \ eight years of my life (since finishing high school) working towards a job and\
  \ a life I wasn't sure that I wanted. In a quarter life crisis that probably too\
  \ many millennials are familiar with, I realised that my entire life couldn't exist\
  \ within the hometown where I was born and grew up.\n\nConsequently, just like every\
  \ other 20-something with Insta-Envy and Pinterest Depression, I began the steps\
  \ to changing my life. \nThe allure of Spanish as a language, despite sounding so\
  \ exotic and fun, is that it is allegedly one of the easiest languages to learn\
  \ and is widely spoken in some form all over the world. \n\nBeyond the beauty of\
  \ the Spanish language was the promise of a bright, colourful, vibrant city and\
  \ culture. An opportunity to join a community of dynamic people who love their food,\
  \ art, architecture, and are knowledgeable about their agriculture and history.\n\
  \nIn my enthusiasm I applied for leave from my permanent position as a North Queensland,\
  \ high school English and Film teacher and booked a flight for a season where I\
  \ wouldn't freeze (from tropical to icicle? No thanks.)\n\nAdmittedly, being from\
  \ a small, supportive town with close friends and closer enemies (you know the saying).\
  \ They all seemed to agree. They wanted me to find happiness, but not at the extent\
  \ of missing a flight and being stuck in Hong Kong (Ni hao!), or being abducted\
  \ from my hotel (thanks a lot, 'Taken'), or worse still falling hopelessly in love\
  \ with a charming European and never returning to Australia (remain calm, Mum).\n\
  \nThis idea of dropping everything in my life, being unemployed, leaving my apartment\
  \ untenanted, and just hiking around a new continent with a backpack and a minimal\
  \ understanding of the native language, was scary. The list of things that could\
  \ go wrong were indefinite from breaking my wrist to a fire-nado!\n\nAs fireworks\
  \ exploded into the sky announcing the arrival of 2019 (and my year of literally\
  \ living a life I never thought I'd have) I found fear taking root in the pit of\
  \ my stomach. Had I made a mistake? Sure, as an idealistic, young girl wanting to\
  \ explore Europe I had figured whatever happened I would handle it. Although, now\
  \ that it was real and my ideas had become plans, I realised my time-frame to change\
  \ my mind was closing. I felt limited by an originally limitless opportunity. I\
  \ didn't know what to expect, I had never travelled solo before. Who do you turn\
  \ to when you don't know where you are? Or pull some 'Home Alone 2' stunt and land\
  \ in a city you weren't anticipating? Why would you go overseas with no one to rely\
  \ on? How do people do this? How do they take this leap into the unknown with no\
  \ apprehension or restlessness?\n\nIt wasn't until there was a power outage at my\
  \ local Car Wash with a dead phone that I learnt the answer. Sitting inside what\
  \ I believed to be my suds-covered coffin, unable to call my sister to say my final\
  \ good bye or the manager of the station to rescue me; I had a moment of clarity.\
  \ Shit happens... You. Just. Fucking. Deal. With. It. \n\nThe thought of hurling\
  \ myself into the unknown now empowers me. I am now delighted at the opportunity\
  \ to get into deep shit and have to figure it out for myself. \n\nFor those who\
  \ might be concerned for me during my trip. Don't be. I'm not an unseasoned traveller.\
  \ I've lost my phone in Japan, lost my luggage in Canada, and will hopefully be\
  \ losing myself along the La Rambla boulevard in May (and not my wallet!)"
