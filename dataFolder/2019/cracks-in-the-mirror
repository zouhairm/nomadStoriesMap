Text: "I have read many stories about arranged marriages, but I never thought I would\
  \ meet\nanybody in one \u2013 let alone a woman who was once a 5-year-old bride.\n\
  \nI held on tight as the old car fought with the bumpy road. A gap in the concrete\
  \ barrier\ngaped at us, where a large vehicle had broken through it and fallen over\
  \ the edge. Thin\nmetal wires poked out from the edges of the gap, untouched since\
  \ the accident. Rocks crunched under\nour tyres as the driver guided us along one\
  \ of Nepal\u2019s most dangerous roads, leaving\nKathmandu for the south.\n\nThe\
  \ jagged silhouette of the Himalaya mountains lay behind me as I farewelled the\
  \ cool air\nof high altitude and headed towards the flat, luscious national park\
  \ area of Chitwan. Dust filled my\nlungs at every breath. Scooters zoomed past us\
  \ and intoxicating swirls of incense seeped in\nthrough the window. Notorious as\
  \ one of Nepal\u2019s most fatal roads, it took 10 hours to arrive\nat our destination\
  \ only 170 kilometres away. The shattered side mirror of the car reflected a\nfragmented\
  \ image. Dark circles sat under my eyes; dust in every pore.\n\nA country so frequently\
  \ devastated by natural disasters takes its toll on weary travellers. But\nthe trip\
  \ would be worth it to meet Kharika.\n\nNepal had made headlines in 2015 when a\
  \ 7.8 magnitude earthquake took almost 9,000\nlives. Only two years on, severe flooding\
  \ affected over 100,000 people in the nation\u2019s south.\nFarmers lost crops;\
  \ families lost homes. But as I got out of the car, the yellow grass and\ncracked\
  \ soil showed no evidence of abundant water. Mud brick homes lay crumbled\nwhilst\
  \ makeshift huts stood erect as a silent reminder of prior events. The floods had\n\
  killed more than 70 people and destroyed thousands of homes.\n\nAt dusk, I arrived\
  \ at a small, blue house with a water pump in the front. Kharika\u2019s son\nwelcomed\
  \ us with flower necklaces and silky scarves \u2013 and a steamy hot plate of Dhal\
  \ Bat \u2013\ntraditional Nepalese curry without meat. I was anxious to meet his\
  \ mother who lived next door \u2013 the\nwoman I had travelled so far to meet.\n\
  \nEarly the next morning I knocked on her wooden door, and it opened a crack to\
  \ reveal a\nsmall, dark home. Kharika spoke in Nepalese and slowly shuffled to the\
  \ door. Bent over with\nage, the 95-year-old looked up at me and smiled. She embraced\
  \ my hands in hers. Her\nhands and feet were deeply cracked like the dirt floor\
  \ inside her house. I admired her golden\nanklets that jingled as she lead me to\
  \ sit on a crate at the front door. Only months earlier I had read her biography,\
  \ and now I was here.\n\nKharika had been a 5-year-old bride. Born in the 1920s\
  \ in rural Nepal, she was sold off to be\nmarried due to her family\u2019s extreme\
  \ poverty. She went on to have 12 children. Throughout her\nlife, she endured physical\
  \ and emotional abuse \u2013 for being a woman, for giving birth only to\ngirls\
  \ and for defying laws at the time preventing females from owning land. She fought\
  \ for\nher girls to be educated and equal. Locals threw rocks at her for not giving\
  \ birth to any\nboys. She was still having babies in her 40s, which was the life\
  \ expectancy of females at that\ntime.\n\nWithout a word of English, I felt welcome\
  \ in her home. Kharika gestured for me to\ntake a photo of us. I moved next to her\
  \ while her son explained that his mother had always\npreferred to live a simple\
  \ life. She had never owned a mirror. She hadn\u2019t seen her own reflection in\
  \ a long time.\nI showed her the photo of us. Looking from Kharika\u2019s face to\
  \ the photo, I noticed\nthe wrinkles on her small face and the grey hair reflecting\
  \ boldly in the picture.\n\nShe studied the photo and gingerly ran her finger over\
  \ the image of her aging skin; her\ntoothless smile and silvery hair. The corners\
  \ of her mouth rose slowly and her eyes widened. She whispered something.\nHer son\
  \ smiled and translated her words.\n\u201CWow!\u201D She grinned. \u201CI look fantastic!\u201D"
