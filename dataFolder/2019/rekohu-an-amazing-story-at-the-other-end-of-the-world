Text: "Rekohu - the islands of the Chathams sit an hour an half across the ocean,\
  \ east of Christchurch. They are the first ones to see the sunrise in New Zealand.\
  \ They consist of two islands, the main one Rekohu with Pitt Island next to it.\
  \ The Lieut. W. R. Broughton discovered the islands on November 29th 1791 and took\
  \ possession for the British crown. The islands were inhabited by the Moriori people,\
  \ the original Polynesian people who arrived on the island. The prominent chief\
  \ Nunuku proclaimed the Nunuku laws which forbade war, cannibalism and killing in\
  \ any form. In 1835 900 Maori came to the island and massacred and enslaved the\
  \ Moriori. The population which was 1600 fell to less than 100, 30 years after.\
  \ They kept their language. They are also well-known for their tree carvings on\
  \ the Kopi tree, which are a direct link with their ancestors. Therefore they are\
  \ sacred. In 1950 Miss Jefferson recorded the dendroglyphs and petroglyphs on the\
  \ island and wrote an article in 1955 'the Dendroglyphs of the Chathams' published\
  \ by the Journal of the Polynesian society.\nThe Kopi trees still exist and the\
  \ Islanders are trying to find a way to preserve them. Some have been cut and treated\
  \ to be displayed in the museums. But it is important to keep the tradition going\
  \ as they are the voice of the ancestors and we cannot lose this precious knowledge.\n\
  Rekohu is also known for its fisheries with the blue cod and kina, sea urchins.\
  \ in 1992 while the Moriori claim was active, the Sealords fisheries deal ceded\
  \ a third of New Zealand fisheries to Maori. The Moriori claims were heard and between\
  \ May 1994 and March 1996 the verdict became in favour of the Moriori case. This\
  \ led to a deal between the Crown and The Moriori in 2017.  \nThe last full-blooded\
  \ Moriori Tommy Solomon died in 1933 but since the creation of the Kopinga Marae,\
  \ a big effort is made to keep the culture alive and preserve the survival of the\
  \ language by creating learning materials.\nThe island is amazing for its history\
  \ and also some incredible rock formations such as basalt columns on one side of\
  \ the island. If very lucky you might find some petrified shark teeth in the main\
  \ lagoon.\nIt is quite a secret place. You have to earn it, but there is so much\
  \ to discover. You take a plane to the Chatham islands from Wellington and a few\
  \ hours later you will be in Waitangi discovering this incredible place. Don't forget\
  \ a warm sweater and the world will be yours. In Waitangi, there is a pub and great\
  \ kai moana - seafood.  When landing, have a look at the great view of the lagoon,\
  \ the colours are incredible. \nYou might be lucky and discover the local animal\
  \ life including seals, albatross, black swans, and the weka, a New Zealand bird\
  \ which is protected on the land but a delicacy on the Chathams. This bird runs\
  \ everywhere so you definitely have to put it in brine for a few days before cooking\
  \ it. \nThis island remains one of the most interesting places I have been to. The\
  \ colours are incredible from the dark mauve of the heather to the red ochre of\
  \ the rocks next to Waitangi which is more like the Nevada desert. When I went back\
  \ to Wellington I was invited as an artist to show some paintings. Having a visually\
  \ impaired son I did some touchable paintings of the dendroglyphs but only for blind\
  \ people. The woman came several times and touched them I thought something was\
  \ not right so I asked her and she told me that she could not see anymore but touching\
  \ the paintings reminded her of her time in the Chathams for her honeymoon. It was\
  \ so touching and she came back the next day and every day until the exhibition\
  \ closed.\nThis really a place to discover and research before you go."
