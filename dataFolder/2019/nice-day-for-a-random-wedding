Text: "\u2018Do you have a boyfriend?\u2019 Abdullah asked Lois, for the second time\
  \ that morning.\n\nHe\u2019d pulled over next to a cleft in the cliffs and was looking\
  \ at himself in the jeep mirror.\n\nWe climbed up through the sinking sand to see\
  \ markings by the Nabataens, prehistoric paintings that looked like elongated aliens\
  \ holding hands. In the flicker of light that passed over the carvings, I sensed\
  \ myself in an earlier version of the world, a lost kingdom, a page out of an old\
  \ holy book. Goats spilled down the rubble. The only mountains with names were those\
  \ where something significant had happened.  \n\nLois and I had met the day before\
  \ but stayed up late, lying on the floor of the Wadi Rum desert. After a traditional\
  \ Bedouin meal of chicken buried in the ground, we couldn\u2019t tear our eyes away\
  \ from all the stars coming out. It felt like we were on an uninhabited planet,\
  \ red as Mars, empty as the moon. At dawn, we\u2019d headed back to camp and seen\
  \ two camels moving in slow-motion across the dunes, like a hallucination. \n\n\u2018\
  My cousin\u2019s getting married today,\u2019 Abdullah told us, on our way to the\
  \ border. \u2018I can take you if you like.\u2019\n\nHe pulled the jeep towards\
  \ a goat-hair tent in the village before we had a chance to agree. \n\nMen were\
  \ sitting in the shade on cushions spread out along a carpet, in long white robes\
  \ and checked headdresses. A little boy brought us tea. I couldn\u2019t help but\
  \ fear we were intruding, two foreign women in a tent with all Abdullah\u2019s brothers\
  \ and uncles. The man next to us introduced himself as the groom. Shyly, I offered\
  \ him congratulations. \n\n\u2018There\u2019s a problem with the first wife,\u2019\
  \ Abdullah told us. \u2018I\u2019ll be right back.\u2019\n\nHe left us among men\
  \ smoking, leaning on their elbows to study us. \n\n\u2018You have boyfriends?\u2019\
  \ an uncle asked.\n\nIt was a question that bothered me back home. The truth was,\
  \ I was interested in Lois. I tried to read the meaning in her shrug. I told him\
  \ we were on our way back to Eilat, the Red Sea.\n\n\u2018You might as well stay\
  \ for the party,\u2019 the uncle said. \u2018The border closes at two this afternoon.\u2019\
  \ \n\nIt was more than an hour until we saw Abdullah\u2019s jeep again, in the distance.\
  \ I crossed the dust on foot to tell him we needed to get back. It was only in the\
  \ midst of having a word with him that I noticed the sheep, fully skinned, hanging\
  \ all around us. A half-dozen boys stood waiting, listening to my unintelligible\
  \ speech with knives behind their backs. On a blanket, a sheep\u2019s head stared\
  \ up at me, listening too. They were preparing the wedding feast. Abdullah\u2019\
  s arms were red up to the elbow as if he was wearing gloves. He promised we\u2019\
  d head out as soon as he was finished.\n \nI was anxious when I returned to tent.\
  \ Lois was undergoing an interview as a potential wife. Before I could tell her\
  \ about the situation we found ourselves in, we heard drums and trumpets nearby.\
  \ \n\n\u2018What is it?\u2019 I asked Abdullah\u2019s brother or nephew. \n\n\u2018\
  Why don\u2019t you go take a look? But please -- no cameras.\u2019 \n\nA stone\u2019\
  s throw away was music and singing. In the next tent, women in bright dresses and\
  \ dangling adornments were dancing with children. We had only taken a few steps\
  \ when they surrounded us, and without a word we were drawn into the dance. In our\
  \ hoodies and jeans, Lois and I swayed among the girls and grandmothers, their faces\
  \ painted, flipping their hair around in pure joy, like they were all in on a secret\
  \ as old as time, and inviting us to share it with them. \n\nThere were no clocks\
  \ in the desert. When I felt it must be nearing mid-afternoon, I asked Lois if she\
  \ thought we should see about getting out of there.\n\n\u2018Why?\u2019 she said.\
  \ She smiled and grabbed my hand. \u2018Don\u2019t you want to see what\u2019s going\
  \ to happen?\u2019"
