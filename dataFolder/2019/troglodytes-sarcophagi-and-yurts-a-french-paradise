Text: "\"Troglodytes, sarcophagi and yurts: one summer in a French paradise\" \n\n\
  As long as I remember, I have been feeling trapped at home. That feeling remained\
  \ somewhere in the back of my head and made me an insecure person during my whole\
  \ young life. But I decided to do something about it. So, I ended up in France.\
  \  \n\nI fell in love with the French language as a teenager and today the charm\
  \ of its spell still amazes me. I checked some ways of volunteering in the internet\
  \ in order to avoid spending a whole summer in my hometown feeling as a prisoner\
  \ of myself and there it was: Workaway at Dou\xE9 la Fontaine in a cave from the\
  \ Middle Ages called \u201CTroglodytes et sarcophages\u201D. Back then, I was still\
  \ studying History and the idea of travelling to France as a tourist guide sounded\
  \ just lovely.  \n\nI never thought about the possible risks of the experience until\
  \ I was in the plane: if I would fit in the house, what other \u2018workawayers\u2019\
  \ would be there, if I would get along with them, if it would not be some kind of\
  \ scam... But as soon as we landed, I stopped questioning everything. No more thinking,\
  \ it was going to be all right.  \n\nI arrived in that little village at night,\
  \ Fabienne picked me up at the station and I met the rest the next morning. For\
  \ almost two months I was given the opportunity to blend into a new context, speaking\
  \ a language that I love and perfecting it. I always had the feeling that when you\
  \ speak a language which is not your mother tongue is like those words were not\
  \ yours, but the words of someone else, someone more exotic, freer, smarter, better.\
  \ As I see it, as long as I was speaking French a new me was growing up.  \n\nThere\
  \ was always a story to tell back there. Philippe and Fabienne had a yurt in the\
  \ garden and they let stay outsiders who stopped by for just one night or maybe\
  \ a couple days via couchsurfing. I remember a family with three kids who were travelling\
  \ around 'les chateaux de la Loire' by bicycle but, if I still can remember vividly\
  \ one remarkable guest, that would be Sylvain. He was blind in one eye and he rode\
  \ a manufactured solar powered e-bike.  \n\nHowever, I had a routine, but it was\
  \ a nice routine to have. Working in the afternoon guiding tourists through the\
  \ caves and free mornings to travel around other towns and cities nearby, going\
  \ to wine tastings and bonding with the rest of volunteers.  \n\nDuring the whole\
  \ summer, we were two Spanish people, a French girl, a British guy and a Scottish\
  \ girl, a German girl, an Italian girl and a Chinese boy. Summer passed among karaokes,\
  \ barbecues, games, mini road trips, parties, hanging out in the garden while Gareth\
  \ played the guitar, eating the wonderful tarte aux prunes made by Fabienne, attending\
  \ jazz concerts in other caves, bowling, going to the movies, getting to know the\
  \ picturesque inhabitants of Dou\xE9 and this special family who, in some way, became\
  \ mine for a little while.  \n\nA funny anecdote regarding work? One day I had a\
  \ huge group to guide, maybe almost 50 people. During the tour, I mentioned the\
  \ name of the archaeologist who had found that cave over twenty years ago, Michel\
  \ Cousin, and one woman burst into laughter. I was wondering if I did or said something\
  \ wrong, but it was not because of me: her husband was Cousin\u2019s brother-in-law!\
  \  \n\nWhile I stayed in that little town, I felt like I was in my own bubble, where\
  \ problems could not reach and I finally could act like myself. I discovered a whole\
  \ new world and a way of life completely different than mine. I just wanted to run\
  \ away when I decided to fly there but I never expected to find something that enriching\
  \ and exciting. I think in a capitalist, individualist and m\xE9tro-boulot-dodo\
  \ world everybody deserves to experience that feeling at least once, if only to\
  \ become stronger and go back to real life."
