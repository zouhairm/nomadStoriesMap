Text: "I must admit, I didn't know anything about Prague. Even further, I didn't know\
  \ anything about the Czech Republic except that it was formally called Czechoslovakia.\
  \ Yet I had my one way ticket booked and have officially announced I was moving\
  \ there for a year. When people asked me \"Why Prague?\" I would give my honest\
  \ answer that it was where I found the most affordable TEFL program and found out\
  \ that it was one of the easiest countries in Europe to get a visa. I saved the\
  \ money, said my goodbyes, and got on the plane. \nI was 22 and this was the first\
  \ time I would be living on my own making the big move from my parents basement.\
  \ \nNow three years later I have been teaching english in Prague, traveled to 13\
  \ countries, and have even lived for four months in Greece. I went from having mental\
  \ breakdowns over not knowing where my life was going to completely calm go with\
  \ the flow type of gal. All because I took that chance. Before I found TEFL, I didn't\
  \ know about making a living overseas. I didn't think it was possible outside of\
  \ study abroads or volunteering. And now here I am, people from home messaging how\
  \ I was able to spend 4 months on the beach in Greece. Or how I am able to spend\
  \ a weekend in Berlin, wake up in Prague, then get on a bus to Krakow. \nWhat TEFL\
  \ did for me was more than just giving me a certificate allowing me to teach anywhere\
  \ in the world. It opened so many doors to the possibilities out there. Teaching,\
  \ Workaway, Housesitting, visas, etc. There are just so many to see that world that\
  \ people don't know about. I never thought I would be able to just hop on a plane\
  \ and make roots in a new country, but now that's something I could do without any\
  \ anxiety. \nWhen I graduated University, I did it the traditional way. Cubicle\
  \ box in the city with benefits and a commuters card. It was we were all striving\
  \ for after graduation in a country where jobs are so scarce. But, although I was\
  \ living someones \"dream\" I realised that living the next 50 something years heading\
  \ into the same office everyday, working for the weekends, and maybe two weeks vacation\
  \ a year, was something I couldn't bear. I wasn't inspired. I wasn't captivated.\
  \ And I certainly wasn't happy although that pay check made my bank account happy.\
  \ I was just breaching into the adult world and already I couldn't wait to find\
  \ a way back to adolescence.\nI refused to accept this had to be real life, being\
  \ raised with a generation that believed in self-worth and happiness. So I did my\
  \ research after a whimsical trip to Ireland and found TEFL. It was nerve-wrecking,\
  \ scary, and one the best decisions I have ever made. \nTake chances. That's what\
  \ I have to say from my story. I have never been happier and of course it's not\
  \ always bliss happiness. There's times I doubt myself, doubt my abilities, but\
  \ then I remember where I came from and how far I've come. Everything that I know\
  \ now with a future ahead of me that I'm finally excited for. \nI don't know where\
  \ I'll end up but I do know that I will let my love for travel lead the way."
