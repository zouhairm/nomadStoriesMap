Text: "Here at the Thatched Cottage Hotel, in the middle of the New Forest, I work\
  \ 5 hours a day, 5 days a week, taking care of the kitchen and the breakfast saloon,\
  \ usually. I'm a general assistant. In exchange, housing and food. Fair. Maybe even\
  \ fairer for me.  \nYesterday I took the bicycle that's available for the volunteers\
  \ (quite old by the way, it belonged to a rental) and went down the road. I was\
  \ recommended going by the right, on that same crossing I went to the left and saw\
  \ the church, on the last time.\nThe bike seat was loose and going backwards. I\
  \ thought it wouldn't be a problem, or that it wouldn't bother me much. Big mistake.\
  \ \nAfter leaving the village by the \"highway\", I found a large glade on both\
  \ sides of the road, where many horses freely grazed around. I thought I'd never\
  \ see \"wild\" horses. I'm still in doubt if they are really wild or not. If they\
  \ have owners or not. For they're completely free, no fences or anything like. \n\
  Inside a playpen - with free access in and out - some poneys. Or dwarf horses. I\
  \ found them very strange.  \nThe horses would organize on small groups on the vast\
  \ ground. When I got closer to one of those groups, they would step back. When I\
  \ got closer to one horse more ahead of the group (would that be the alpha male?),\
  \ he, intimidatingly, approached me.  Still I wasn't attacked by a horse, and have\
  \ never seen how it is, and don't wanna find out.  \nI went back to the bike on\
  \ my back, always facing the \"alpha male\". I ran to see if they would come after.\
  \ The pasture was better. \nI got back to the bike and followed the road, the seat\
  \ annoying me. I had to stick to an awkward position, my arms barely touching the\
  \ handlebars. I felt I was on an old scooter. \nI stopped once more to take some\
  \ pictures and rest my butt. I opened the phone map and saw that I could get to\
  \ Lyndhurst and complete a round back to Brockenhurst. \nAnd so I arrived, with\
  \ a lot of effort and pain in the butt, to the end of the road. And I came across\
  \ a very crowded highway. Single lane, as the one I just left, but very busy. I\
  \ would have to return by the same way: Some 7 km back, all with the broken seat.\
  \ And it started raining. I found a way to put the camera in the pocket of my waterproof\
  \ jacket and went on, all crooked, riding a crooked bike, in the countryside of\
  \ England, under the rain. \nIt could all be just a dream and I would wake up on\
  \ my warm bed. Could..."
