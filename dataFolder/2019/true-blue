Text: "As I prepared to continue on route 80 east through the Great Salt Flats, scuba\
  \ gear in the back of a pickup caught my attention. He was turning left onto a small,\
  \ straight, endless highway aiming south into barren land. I followed the truck.\
  \ We roll through a distant ribbon of mountainous rocks into another flat section\
  \ of The Great Basin. He turned onto a dirt road at a little sign that read, \u201C\
  Blue Lakes.\u201D \n\nIn the beginning of my travels, I was marketing-focused. What\
  \ I intended to tell people guided my decisions. Things like, \u201CI swam in the\
  \ Atlantic, Gulf of Mexico, and the Pacific in 10 days, driving!\u201D I believed\
  \ that my newfound freedom was the ability to choose the goal. \n\nOff-roading in\
  \ my rented Prius wasn\u2019t part of the plan. It kicked up dust and I feared for\
  \ the tires on the rocky terrain. Anxiety struck at the loss of connection to Google\
  \ Maps. And when I made turns I couldn\u2019t remember, I had to remind myself that\
  \ I was following someone, it\u2019s 2018, and I wouldn\u2019t die without the internet.\
  \ \n\nThis trip came about after leaving a career in business operations in the\
  \ digital marketing industry. If I had stayed, than I could have paid off my debt\
  \ in 7 years. I questioned that decision often and had no idea how I was going to\
  \ survive after spending my savings.\n\nSo there I was, at a weathered sign that\
  \ had a handful of bullet holes in a muddy parking lot that read, \u201CWildlife\
  \ Management Area.\u201D It was flat, with no water, and a boardwalk stretching\
  \ into dunes for longer than I felt like walking. I regretted following the truck\
  \ ...until I arrived in awe.\n\nThe initial silence of non-urgent sensory information\
  \ replacing the anxiety of underlying professional competition was shocking when\
  \ I left my job. My mind wanted to exist with alarm to fuel productivity. But once\
  \ calm, I had ignited an internal battle of motivational factors: a predetermined\
  \ headline vs an unknown experience. \n\nStaring out from the rusty, haphazard pier\
  \ upon Blue Lake surrounded by desert and distant low mountains was a stock remote\
  \ vacation view: picturesque. Scuba divers were stirring up the sediment 10 feet\
  \ below me. My view of them swimming was only hindered by the glare of the sky\u2019\
  s reflection on the surface of the water. When I closed my eyes the air felt cool,\
  \ but sunny, fresh, with a sense of preparedness. \n\nMy body involuntarily braced\
  \ for that initial chill when I dove in, but it never came. Blue Lake is geothermal\
  \ and 70 degrees at its surface. Compared to the 65 degree morning with a breeze,\
  \ I felt held and soothed once submerged. The deeper I got, the warmer it was. My\
  \ mind became engulfed with the sensation of my body being comfortably confused.\
  \ Gliding into the shallows, I am accustomed to digging my toes in for cool, solid\
  \ ground. Instead, I fell into 85 degree, underwater quicksand. It captivated me.\n\
  \nAt this time, I had been on the road for four of my five planned weeks. After\
  \ applying to dozens of open positions on the internet with no response, I had met\
  \ a band and was offered an opportunity to go on tour. Since then, I returned home,\
  \ sold most of what I owned, found work at a ski resort in California in winter,\
  \ and have accepted a job waiting tables in Alaska this summer. I will have my debt\
  \ paid off in 2 years. We are taught that building a foundation in one place is\
  \ the only way to be stable, but without the overhead and intentionally seeking\
  \ opportunity, being a nomad is now serving me better than a full time permanent\
  \ job ever has. \n\nIf we plan and execute our lives, the best we can hope for is\
  \ met expectations: A positive feedback loop lending itself to more plans, more\
  \ executions, and the same reward. I have now discovered a seemingly counterintuitive\
  \ set of goals, places, feelings and state of being using the instinct to simply\
  \ and  unpredictably turn left."
