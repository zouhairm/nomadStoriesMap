Text: "My grandma, mom and sister are all called Mar\xEDa del Valle. My paternal grandmother\
  \ was called Pilar. Many of my friends are called Carmen. To any listener - Spanish\
  \ speaker or not - they will just sound as authentic Hispanic names. What most don't\
  \ know is that each name hides a virgin behind it. \n\nWhen I asked my grandma where\
  \ her name came from she talked to me about her small village, Salda\xF1a in Palencia,\
  \ and how their virgin is Mar\xEDa del Valle (The Virgin of the Valley) because\
  \ she appeared to a shepherd in a close by valley. She then went on to explain to\
  \ me how her friend Africa was called like the continent because she was born in\
  \ Ceuta (one of the few remaining Spanish territories in Africa) where the Black\
  \ Madonna of Africa once appeared and now is venerated. My grandma explained to\
  \ me that at her time the newborn girl was commonly named after the virgin of her\
  \ village (or city) or as the saint of her date of birth. \n\nI then started to\
  \ grow hyper aware of the many regional cults dedicated to the Virgin Mary all throughout\
  \ Spain. For instance, I took Seville as an area of research. In Hispalis, there\
  \ are 17 \"coronated\" virgins and many more minor ones. When I changed schools\
  \ and one of the girls was called Macarena I asked her if it was because of the\
  \ Sevillian Virgin in the district of San Gil. She was in shock, and told me that\
  \ I was the first person outside from Seville that had actually guessed the origin\
  \ of her name, and hadn't thought about the song. To her astonishment I even knew\
  \ that the virgin has five tears of glass. All of her family is from Seville. \n\
  \nI quickly realized how the virgins told so much about Spain, about Spain's catholic\
  \ and devoted side, sometimes forgotten. As someone who has always lived in bigger\
  \ cities I was never aware of this, of its impact on my culture. After so much research,\
  \ and fascination, I decided to take action and look at my country and its customs\
  \ through the Madonnas. I first visited Salda\xF1a (Palencia), to see the Virgin\
  \ after which my grandma, mom and sister were named after. My maternal grandfather\
  \ was born in Nava del Rey (Valladolid) not too far away. The Virgin from his village\
  \ was of the \"Pegotes\" accompanied by a great party with mules, carriages and\
  \ the such. My maternal grandmother, was named after the V\xEDrgen del Pilar, a\
  \ Virgin that appeared on a \"pilar\" (a pillar). \n\nThen, going north to Castille\
  \ and the Mancha, where my paternal grandfather was born; Quintanar de la Orden.\
  \ Here I found the Virgin of the Piety. I then continued travelling South, with\
  \ the mandatory stop at Seville. I actually went on Easter, in the peak of religious\
  \ fanaticism. It was extremely interesting for me to see the different \"cofrad\xED\
  as\" (religious guilds) and their rivalry. Both of my friends named Carmen are from\
  \ the southern city of C\xE1diz. The virgin of the Carmen was the patroness of the\
  \ sailors, guiding them.  When visiting the Southern city I saw how land and sea\
  \ are one to \"gaditanos\". I ended my voyage at Ceuta, and seeing the Black Madonna\
  \ of Africa. \n\nThe incursion into this religious fanaticism and devotion showed\
  \ me how even the smallest villages can venerate different Virgins. I was able to\
  \ go back to my roots, to understand the names governing my family tree. I was able\
  \ to understand the names around me.  Having moved to New York for college, I have\
  \ discovered the world of film, of documentary. Looking back on this search of national\
  \ and self identity through the virgins, and trying to continue this trip - in vain\
  \ - through Google I have realized how obscure the topic is. In this sometimes fruitless\
  \ search I have chosen virgins for my future trips. For example, I have discovered\
  \ that there are many more black Madonnas, the most famous one curiously in the\
  \ North, Catalonia. I would love to travel through Spain and document with video\
  \ the different virgins, their appearances, stories, festivities dedicated to them."
