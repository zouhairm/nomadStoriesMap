Text: "I am afraid of heights. My nightmares are of rickety railings and endless falls.\
  \ It\u2019s that drop in my stomach, that physical sensation.\n\nI avoid heights.\n\
  \nHome of the world\u2019s first zipline, Costa Rica's Monteverde boasts a number\
  \ of zipline parks.\n\nFor days now I had studied their promotional flyers and for\
  \ days I had almost signed up for a canopy tour.\n\nOnly I was finding excuses not\
  \ to: It\u2019s late. I\u2019ve been walking all day. It\u2019s wednesday.\n\n\u201C\
  I\u2019m really afraid of horses\u201D said Inga who I met hiking on Cerro Amigos.\n\
  \nWe were climbing the world's steepest hill and chatting between breaths.\n\n\u201C\
  I\u2019m afraid, but I booked a horseback riding tour.\u201D\n\n\u201CIt\u2019s\
  \ heights for me\u201D I admitted to her. \u201CAnd everyone says this is the place\
  \ to zipline.\u201D\n\n\u201CSo are you doing it?\u201D\n\nIt was my last afternoon\
  \ in Monteverde. \u201CI really should.\u201D\n\nI walked back to the hotel very\
  \ slowly, stopped for lunch, had a coffee.\n\nI poked my head into reception.\n\n\
  \u201CAm I too late for the last zipline tour?\u201D\n\n\u201CNope, there\u2019\
  s one in 20 minutes.\u201D\n\nCrap. I had not anticipated that.\n\n\u201CFantastic,\u201D\
  \ I said. \u201CLet\u2019s book it.\u201D\n\nWhy am I doing this to myself, you\
  \ ask? For three days I had managed to avoid facing that I was running away from\
  \ something as trivial as ziplining. But knowing that Inga was out there facing\
  \ her fears....\n\nI waited for the courtesy shuttle. My stomach wasn\u2019t feeling\
  \ good.\n\nIt felt even worse by the time the tour lead stepped in front of our\
  \ group and started explaining. Cross your legs, dominant hand out, non-dominant\
  \ hand on the ropes. Never let go of the cable. Never grip in front. Break like\
  \ this. Hand signals. How will I remember all of this?\n\nThen it was time for the\
  \ first zipline. The queue ahead of me got shorter and shorter. It was my turn.\n\
  \n\u201CJump up!\u201D the guide instructed and clipped me in. \u201CRemember: hand\
  \ out, cross your legs, break when you see the signal.\u201D\n\nAnd then he pushed\
  \ me off.\n\nIt was absolutely... not frightening. The harness felt secure, breaking\
  \ was intuitive. The ride wasn\u2019t even that fast.\n\nFrom there every cable\
  \ got a little longer and a little higher - and I loved it!\n\nThe fresh air was\
  \ blowing in my face and the whir of the clip on the cable ringing in my ears. Open\
  \ fields and farm houses to my left, the canopy of the Monteverde Cloud Forest to\
  \ my right. Birds flying next to me, probably wondering what the heck was going\
  \ on.\n\nMore cables followed, each longer and longer. I even braved the Superman:\
  \ on my stomach, face first, 1590 meters - the longest in Latin America!\n\nBut\
  \ then came the Tarzan swing.\n\nAs I walked out onto the undulating metal platform,\
  \ I knew I wasn\u2019t going to do this. I pictured myself stepping off the grid\
  \ and plummeting 30 meters before the rope would start to catch me. My nightmares\
  \ of falling off towers came back in a blink.\n\n\u201CNext!\u201D shouted the guide\
  \ at the end of the platform.\n\n\u201CDo I have to do this?\u201D I asked.\n\n\u201C\
  It\u2019s just one step\u201D he joked.\n\n\u201CIt\u2019s not the step I have a\
  \ problem with.\u201D\n\n\u201CI can also push you.\u201D\n\nThat\u2019s not helping!\n\
  \n\u201CCan I not do it?\u201D\n\nHe shrugged. \u201CThen walk back to reception.\
  \ This is the last one.\u201D\n\nI let out the breath I hadn\u2019t realized I held.\n\
  \nI turned around and instantly felt a twinge of annoyance with myself. I had come\
  \ here, conquered all the ziplines, and yet I couldn\u2019t muster the courage to\
  \ face a few seconds of falling? I thought back to how the platform was swinging,\
  \ and how the girl in front of me had dropped and screamed.\n\nI suddenly realized\
  \ that it was okay for me to not enjoy a free fall and that, probably, I never would.\
  \ I didn\u2019t need to do something just because others were doing it.\n\nI had\
  \ made the right decision.\n\nSo I gave back my harness, bought myself an ice cream\
  \ to celebrate my achievement and enjoyed the fact that I had had a great day and\
  \ discovered a little more about myself."
