Text: "The music begin. I'm in a hospital in Siem Reap, Cambodia. The sound of doctor\
  \ Richner's cello takes me to a peaceful and hopeful atmosphere. \nSuddenly, silence.\
  \ A kind voice starts telling about the horrible time of the Khmer Rouge. All the\
  \ cruelty and its consequences. The good ones.\nI could understand a bit better\
  \ the joy I saw on the faces despite the recent violent past and the present without\
  \ great opportunities. Indeed, there was the possibility of a certain bitterness.\
  \ But I believe the most intelligent route would be joy. In a place where the reality\
  \ was marked by prisons, tortures, closures of hospitals and schools, forced labor\
  \ in the fields, having little is a lot, mainly because, in this little, freedom\
  \ and hope are included.\nAnd people like doctor Richner is a huge source of hope\
  \ and make you feel you can do much more of you time in Earth and do not have the\
  \ right to just blame the authorities. Everyone can make difference in small or\
  \ big scale. \nAfter being forced to leave the country during the red time, this\
  \ Swiss pediatrician was able to come back. Despite all the odds, he built and maintained\
  \ five hospitals, where 85% of the country's children are cared for, at no cost\
  \ to the families. \nThis man, who depended on donations of millions around the\
  \ world, had dinner with presidents, reunion with businessmen, took his time on\
  \ the weekends to play for visitors in Siem Reap to tell a bit about the Cambodian\
  \ reality and, who knows, take people out of the tourist bubble, where even poverty\
  \ can be a postcard.\nHe passed way in 2018, but his music and attitude will echo\
  \ in my mind forever."
