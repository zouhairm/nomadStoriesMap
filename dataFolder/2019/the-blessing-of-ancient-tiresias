Text: "Some say old Taleesa lost her sight by staring too much at the rapturing glint\
  \ of the snow. The others \u2014 the malicious ones, those too young to remember\
  \ \u2014 whisper about unrequited love and self-harm, snickering behind her back\
  \ like mischievous little rascals. Old Taleesa was indeed fond of winter, but the\
  \ blame for her illness was not to be put on the ghastly white expanse hugging Aujuittuq\
  \ like a cozy blanket.  \n\u201CThey came to us in the morning, and took 87 people\u201D\
  \ she rasped, her wrinkled, calloused hands ripping apart a form of bannock. I sat\
  \ there quietly, the Labrador tea cooling down under my fingers \u201CIt was in\
  \ August, I will never forget it. I had just kissed a boy for the first time. I\
  \ thought I loved him. How foolish, isn\u2019t it?\u201D\nShe paused, tilting her\
  \ head ever-so-slightly and looking at me with sad, motionless irises. She could\
  \ not see me, of course. It had been so long since Taleesa had admired the orderly\
  \ houses of Ellesmere or the daily rites of her people, the Inuit. And yet, she\
  \ jealously treasured the memories of life before Deportation, clinging to them\
  \ like an anchor to her past.\n\u201CWhat happened next?\u201D \n\u201CIt\u2019\
  s all a little hazy. It\u2019s been so long\u201D the silence was filled with the\
  \ scratching of my pen on the notebook \u201CThey brought us on a rusty ship like\
  \ cargo and left us on three different islands. We had no food and the caribou skins\
  \ were not enough for everybody. I was\u2026 always cold. Have you ever been so\
  \ cold that you couldn\u2019t move your fingers, Miss Ervaz?\u201D\n\u201CI can\u2019\
  t even imagine\u201D\n\u201CThe first months of \u2018Relocation\u2019, as they\
  \ call it, were rough. We took some time to adjust to the climate\u201D the cobweb\
  \ of wrinkles on her face contorted into a wry smile \u201CThe Inuit are shrewd\
  \ people, you see. We share food, we look out for each other. Things have gotten\
  \ better, but no one remembers Inukjuak anymore. Will you share my story?\u201D\n\
  \u201CI\u2019m a journalist, that\u2019s my job\u201D and like that, hours went\
  \ by, my notebook filling with stories and accounts of life in the Arctic. \n\u201C\
  You know. It\u2019s a funny human thing, building connections where, in fact, there\
  \ is just nothingness\u201D she muttered, huddled in her irnauti, when I rose to\
  \ my feet to thank her \u201Cwhen I was your age I would look at the snow. If you\
  \ stare too much into the whiteness, you\u2019ll start seeing cities and patterns,\
  \ beautiful landscapes, people waving at you. Sometimes, I thought I could see the\
  \ future. Sometimes it looked like Inukjuak, like home.\u201D\nAs I stepped out\
  \ in the perpetual twilight, the horizon encased among the stocky red buildings\
  \ of Aujuittuq, the chilly wind of the North kissed me goodbye. Crouching down I\
  \ thought about Taleesa and the blissful curse bestowed upon her. Was she a Saint?\
  \ A pariah? My gloved fingers stiffly dug into the hard blanket of snow -- the cold\
  \ was merciless, but I didn\u2019t want to avert my gaze.\nThe Inuit have more than\
  \ fifty ways to say \u201Csnow\u201D. None of those came to my mind at that moment,\
  \ but I thought that maybe, if I stared long enough, I would see a seven-year-old\
  \ Taleesa, still innocent and carefree, smiling at me from Inukjuak."
