Text: "Traveling to unknown/new places was alway been my motto. Beside enjoyment,\
  \ traveling can give you new experience and develop your capacity and empower you\
  \ to self-dependent. Traveling mainly gives a way of developing new ideas and conncept\
  \ about certain areas we admire or get amuse. Travel to certain cities, remote areas\
  \ or villages makes us familiar with new people their culture, ideas or simply saying\
  \ it makes us familiar with the indigenous knowledge of that places which might\
  \ be helpful on future decisions makilng and relationship building. \nI am from\
  \ mountanious country Nepal and student of forestry ( M sc and B sc) so of course\
  \ i like to travel in many concept or ideas. First of all i like to travel so i\
  \ can get more knowledge on native plant or animals of that places. Knowing the\
  \ ecology of certain areas can be great adventurous as from my background of my\
  \ study. Secondly, ethnobotany involves around plant and animal can be interesting\
  \ for improvement of knowledge on forestry background.\nAs it was well known fact\
  \ that from my study background been to lost places. I have been to bajang and bajura\
  \ as work or even taken as trip to beautiful remote district of nepal for more than\
  \ 20 days which becomes one of the beautiful travel trip of my career or life. \n\
  On the first day of our trip we take off from kathmandu capital city of Nepal. Along\
  \ with me we have three other member one was Kamal raj aryal our leader on work,\
  \ usha adhikari ecologist and other was sanjaya tamang who was our driver. We pritivi\
  \ highway and then join mahendra higway for the way to Atariya ( about 700 km away\
  \ from kathmandu). In the road way we went to butwal after watching beautiful mountain\
  \ on pritivi highway. After 10 hour of travel then we take rest at divya hotel at\
  \ butwal. On the morning at 7 am we take away from butwal and headed toward atariya\
  \ on the we have some lunch. It wa enjoyable watching big plain of terai region\
  \ with forest ( some are national park forest ). Then on second day night about\
  \ 6 pm we arrived at atariya and stay at hotel area. Then on third day, we take\
  \ away from atariya to sapebagar, achham. Along the way taking attitudes up to 1500m\
  \ from terai to middle montain crossing the beautiful city of dipayal. We gather\
  \ with some colleagues of kamal dai and others have some fest and quality time we\
  \ have good nap on their quater . On the fourth day morning we headed toward sodhang\
  \ our last vechile route than we headed toward our plot area on forest near ditang\
  \ village bajang district. Before leaving we find one local boy as a giude for traveling\
  \ to that village. We take away on sith day and walk on for three days, along the\
  \ way we get familiar with local people and their culture and food on night stay\
  \ at that place. Mostly we had roti and tarkale than we have special with wild mushroom\
  \ on one dinner. After doing field work on ninth day we then return to headquater\
  \ of bajang district and on eleventh day we went to headquater of bajang where we\
  \ observed hade bazar (small market) observed at certain day which was monday. After\
  \ mangalsen ( capital of bajang) we headed toward ranimahal situated at bank of\
  \ kaligandaki river. On the fifteen day of our visit to ranimahal then we had plan\
  \ to return to kathmandu but some knowledge on ranimahal was good for end phase\
  \ of our trip. Ranimahal was established by king mahendra for the pleasure time\
  \ of with queen. Of this remoteness that was kept as good place for lectures like\
  \ poem for kings of Nepal.\nAs i lives and grow up from valley of lekhnath near\
  \ pokkara city. About 1000 m elevation observing great change on elevation from\
  \ 500 m to 3500 m was great and delightful experience with different culture and\
  \ food. I have great influence by the people and culture from different place around\
  \ far west of nepal"
