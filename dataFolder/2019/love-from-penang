Text: "Going overseas is a greatest journey ever. We can see lots of new things which\
  \ is really important to be enjoyed. New friends, new experiences, new places, new\
  \ cultures, or even new love.\n\nSince last year, 2018 I had created my greatest\
  \ journey by going to the neighbour country, Malaysia. I went there not just only\
  \ for spending my time or money but I brought some mission which was actually to\
  \ be a loyal volunteer in International Leadership and English Language Camp (LELaC)\
  \ in University of Sains Malaysa, Penang. \n\nIt is really different when we are\
  \ going to some places with some mission than just for holiday, because we get more\
  \ values and experinces as well. So that happened when I was in Penang, I found\
  \ lots of things that never be expected. The things were I learned on how we cooperate\
  \ each other, dealing with overseas friends, maintain good relation and well-communicated.\
  \ In addition, I do really know the truth of happiness, which is when something\
  \ well-done by the teamwork. Beside that, the things that I never expected was getting\
  \  new friends in which we spread ideas, express opinion in a good way  that made\
  \ we well-connected each other for the future plan and anything. I think those things\
  \ is the real love that never expected before I went to Penang, Malaysia.\n\nActually,\
  \ lots of things that we can get by going abroad. Which could be an unforgettable\
  \ story of life."
