Text: "It takes a certain kind of crazy to drive a motorbike down the Ho Chi Minh\
  \ Trail, something I didn\u2019t think I had in me. On my first trip to Vietnam,\
  \ heeding warnings from my friends and even my doctor, I figured I wasn\u2019t up\
  \ for the adventure. I figured my nerves would get the best of me and I\u2019d overthink\
  \ every windy turn or patch of gravel. I figured I\u2019d never feel secure. But\
  \ on my last night in Saigon, listening to stories of newfound friends who had completed\
  \ the journey, a much stronger fear gripped me: the fear of missing out. So, a year\
  \ later, I found myself back at the top of the country, ready to create some stories\
  \ of my own. \n\tBuying a bike and learning how to drive it in a city like Hanoi\
  \ was a daunting task. I cautiously maneuvered through the mass of disorganized\
  \ traffic, teaching myself how to change gears as other drivers cut me off and horns\
  \ beeped incessantly. My rational mind was telling me this road trip was a bad idea.\
  \ But with each terrifying drive through the narrow, crowded streets of the Old\
  \ Quarter and along equally crowded tree-lined boulevards, my confidence increased.\
  \ When I met two fellow backpackers who were departing on the same route south the\
  \ next day, I knew the time had come. We would eventually become a group of eight,\
  \ finding new members for our crew in hostels along the way.  \n\tOur first drive\
  \ to Ninh Binh was not the liberating, breathtaking experience I had envisioned.\
  \ The three-turned-six-hour journey was all highway and, just as night fell, rain\
  \ came pouring down. It was an inconvenient time to discover that our headlights\
  \ didn\u2019t work and our hostel was in the middle of a rice field with no discernible\
  \ road. As lightning flashed, revealing the vastness of the field and the black\
  \ silhouettes of massive cliffs in the distance, I navigated my bike through the\
  \ mud with one hand on the accelerator and the other holding up my phone as a makeshift\
  \ headlight. \n\tThe breakdowns were plenty and the long days left us exhausted\
  \ when we finally reached our destinations well after dark. Still, we knew one thing\
  \ was certain: we would receive a warm, enthusiastic welcome. After a particularly\
  \ grueling day, a group of (supposed) high-ranking Vietnamese, Thai and Laotian\
  \ government officials invited us to join them for dinner. Treated to a traditional\
  \ family-style meal, complete with B\xFAn b\xF2 Hu\u1EBF (a soup with congealed\
  \ pig\u2019s blood) and lots of R\u01B0\u1EE3u \u0111\u1EBF (rice wine), by the\
  \ end of the night we were joining in their singalongs. In another town, a group\
  \ of rowdy teenagers invited us home to play video games and drink snake-infused\
  \ whisky. \n\tVietnam never failed us: the long, winding drives through mountains\
  \ overlooking lush canopies of green; the coastal roads grazing white sand beaches\
  \ and dotted with bright magenta flowers; even the most trying of situations had\
  \ a tendency to work out. \n\tOne day we set our route knowing there would be no\
  \ mechanics or cell service for 90km. The rest of our crew was ahead of us when\
  \ my driving buddy\u2019s bike broke down. Stranded on a cliff, we stared over misty\
  \ treetops that provided a beautiful view but reinforced our hopelessness. Just\
  \ then, things fell into place. The first two men to drive by pulled their motorbike\
  \ over to help us. One man\u2019s head was bleeding but the needs of two helpless\
  \ foreigners came first. \n\tPrepared for such an incident, they tied a rope to\
  \ Jack\u2019s bike and towed him down the mountain laced with switchbacks to the\
  \ next roadside town. I followed, laughing as Jack lit a cigarette and sat back\
  \ to enjoy the ride. Hours later, after an engine replacement and a hot meal prepared\
  \ by the mechanic\u2019s wife, we were ready to take off. We couldn\u2019t see the\
  \ road ahead, but the sky was lit up by millions of stars gazing down at us. I didn\u2019\
  t care if I made it out alive\u2014this was living. Whatever I\u2019d imagined driving\
  \ the Trail would be like, I never expected what I found: magnificent freedom."
