Text: "I didn\u2019t expect to find a hunting knife in the cubbyhole of my cab driver\u2019\
  s car. If it wasn\u2019t for my jet lagged induced cotton ball glaze I might have\
  \ panicked \u2013 but there was something about the fake fur seats, the pastry flakes\
  \ on the carpet, the plastic troll trinket dangling from the rear view mirror and\
  \ the tall, awkward stature of Ivan, my pick-up \u2013that all held together a certain\
  \ lightness of being that made me more curious of the situation rather than afraid.\
  \ \n\nBrought up on a farm in South Africa, I was the only girl in town I knew of\
  \ who boasted a collection of Matryoska dolls. I remember their dainty floral stares,\
  \ the smell of varnish and the cute squeaks of twisting them apart. I didn\u2019\
  t know it yet, but Russia had been romancing me for years, and it was only until\
  \ I touched down in Moscow that I finally returned its call. \n\nI asked Ivan about\
  \ his hunting knife. While lighting up a cigarette, he shot me glance through the\
  \ corner of his eye and said it was the Russian way. He then followed up to explain\
  \ that he enjoys boar hunting on the weekends, but reiterated that seeing a knife\
  \ or two is totally normal \u2013 I should get familiar with it. I accepted the\
  \ challenge as trucks whizzed past our cab, spraying the window with mist and water\
  \ from the road. Being early September, the summer rain had begun to slow, leaving\
  \ behind a rich display of flamboyant vegetation reaching out for the sun before\
  \ the icy grasp of winter sends them retreating back to the warm, depths of the\
  \ underground. \n\nWe travelled along a bridge over the Volga river, where the red\
  \ walls of Kremlin snaked along a portion of it. I asked Ivan what his favourite\
  \ thing to see in the city was \u2013 and after running through a list of landmarks,\
  \ he ended with a place that made him smile for the first time during our entire\
  \ meeting \u2013 the arcade museum. Just a few years ago, a group of students from\
  \ St Petersburg managed to save the last 60 remaining arcade games from obscurity.\
  \ In an ironic twist of inspiration from Nikita Krushchev, (the cold-war soviet\
  \ leader at the time) arcade games were manufactured secretly and the manuals considered\
  \ top secret documents as they were imported from the states. However \"fun\" these\
  \ games were intended to be, they were all crafted to instill patriotism and improve\
  \ the physical and mental skills required to serve the state. This means no high-scores\
  \ or self serving feather fluffing - only precision. Today, it\u2019s a great past\
  \ time for anyone off the street to enjoy. \n\nWondering why Ivan didn\u2019t think\
  \ the Kremlin wasn\u2019t a favourite on his list \u2013 he simply said he didn\u2019\
  t care about politics. I guess it\u2019s my favourite feature of Russia \u2013 the\
  \ irony. Lenin believed there was no life after death and yet - he remains. His\
  \ body is kept at 16\xB0c and at 80% humidity. Every 18 months he receives a bath\
  \ in glycerol and potassium, and every 3 years he receives a new suit. Sadly due\
  \ to the economic crisis the charity responsible for his preservation can't afford\
  \ to buy him a new suit this year. Even so, I think he'd be pretty stoked at the\
  \ meltdown of global capitalism.\n\nPulling into a narrow ally, past a mechanic\u2019\
  s garage, a barbershop and finally into the backyard of the backpackers hostel,\
  \ I asked Ivan if he\u2019d ever consider leaving Moscow. He parked the car, opened\
  \ the door for me and finally answered \u2013 \"would you ever leave a person that\
  \ understood you better than you knew yourself?\" And there it was, the Russian\
  \ way, a way of living to understand, rather than to enjoy. That night, I lay awake\
  \ to the sounds of Moscow at night and cast a thought back to that thirteen year\
  \ old girl\u2019s dream and where she was now. I realised that the life you live\
  \ and the one you dream of are two very different forces (but somewhere between\
  \ the swirling mist of night in a foreign land and the gentle fold of sleep, they\
  \ often find each other)."
