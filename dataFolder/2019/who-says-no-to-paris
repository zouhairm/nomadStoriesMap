Text: "Paris. One word and you are transported to a distant land where crepes and\
  \ croissants are your average meals and the Eiffel Tower is a daily sight. A city.\
  \ . .  an idea that has been written about, filmed, and photographed millions of\
  \ times, for one simply doesn\u2019t say no to Paris. What about Paris during the\
  \ Gilet Jaunes riots though? The riots began just before I visited. Seeing the news\
  \ headlines about buildings being wrecked and crowds getting tear gassed, I was\
  \ wary to go. But the tickets were paid for, Airbnb booked. . .  and who says no\
  \ to Paris? So, with a mix of excitement and hesitation, my friend and I boarded\
  \ our plane to France. We had no tour guide in the traditional sense but wandering\
  \ through the city of lights, the streets became our guide with the Seine acting\
  \ as a reassuring presence to determine our place in the city. \n\nHitting the cobblestone\
  \ streets as soon as we arrived, our first sight of Paris is what dreams are made\
  \ of: the Eiffel Tower, seen from a bridge across the Seine. The Statue of Liberty\
  \ stood illuminated in front of it, dwarfed by the beauty and height of the lattice\
  \ iron monument. The first of many staggering sights, we continued our explorations,\
  \ with the French architecture transporting me to a Paris of a distant time. The\
  \ haunting Gothic look of the Notre Dame was an intimidating sight, and even more\
  \ so from inside, with sky high vaulted ceilings. The nostalgic, reminiscent simplicity\
  \ of the nearby Shakespeare and Co. Bookshop put me in the mood for smooth jazz\
  \ and the classic modernity of the bustling French Quarter heightened my excitement.\
  \ But sights are not the along attractions people flock to Paris for. The city is\
  \ famed for gastronomic delights and I had my taste of French specialties: Nutella\
  \ crepes, escargot, beef bourguignon, wine, cr\xE8me brulee, . . . good thing we\
  \ didn\u2019t stay in the city any longer or I would have gained ten pounds.  \n\
  \nParis is also famed for its cultural history. An international center for art,\
  \ fashion, and history, there is no shortage of museums, with the illustrious Louvre\
  \ being most famous. With a baguette to share, we were content waiting in line at\
  \ the Louvre early in the morning to be one of the first to see the Mona Lisa. And\
  \ we did see her. One look was enough. Surreal as it was to stand in front of the\
  \ actual Mona Lisa, the crowd of people pushing around me, and the miniscule size\
  \ of the painting made me question why people idolize it. But art is in the eye\
  \ of the beholder of course, and my eye rested more lovingly on the paintings of\
  \ Monet. The Monet Museum warmed my heart and pleased my eye as I took to the impressionist\
  \ style more than Renaissance art. \n\nArt is not limited to a just the four sides\
  \ of a picture frame though, it is all around us and we saw it everywhere on the\
  \ streets of Paris: the casual chic of French women, the uncaring nonchalance of\
  \ baguette carrying people, the beautiful mess of crowed cafes. . . seeing the art\
  \ of Paris, both ingrained in the physical landscape and the living, moving public,\
  \ I began to understand why Paris has enchanted the minds and hearts, pens and lens,\
  \ brushes and voices of so many. Our long weekend past with blissful serenity with\
  \ barely any contact with the riots, barely. At the end of our visit, we had to\
  \ walk through police cars and ambulances due to the reignition of the riots. Ambulance\
  \ bells were a customary sound heard from the distance, but this was the first time\
  \ we had any real contact with the riots. Luckily the riots were not at its worst\
  \ when we were there and we made it through unscathed. I left Paris feeling wonderful,\
  \ amused and. . . full. Paris was everything I imagine it to be and also nothing\
  \ of how I thought it would feel. I don\u2019t know if it was the lights or the\
  \ river or the bakery scent always in the air that made Paris. . .  lovely."
