Text: "The month is October, the year 2018. I am about to fulfill my dream of visiting\
  \ the very south of Argentina at last. A plane is taking me to Ushuaia from Buenos\
  \ Aires... but first things first and this is departing on time from the capital\
  \ city. Some operators are having delays as their employees are on a strike, which\
  \ even led some flights to be scheduled for another day. Our neighbouring nation\
  \ is in economic turmoil and so are its' airlines. Once I'm up high, I can let go\
  \ and just enjoy of the journey in my economy class seat. Being myself a Uruguayan,\
  \ every time I fly above a snowy mountain peak I cannot help it but think about\
  \ the survivors of the Andes plane crash back in the 70s. Seeing some of these rocky\
  \ giants reaching out from the depths through the deep fog did arise exciment in\
  \ my heart, along with some hints of fear too. When I am trying to make sense out\
  \ of all these thoughts, we're landing at Ushuaia's airport. I have rented an apartment\
  \ a few miles away from the city center but as the check-in time is later I decide\
  \ to take a closer look to the city and the bay area. \nTaking my first steps into\
  \ a new, unknown destination to me is like a rite of passage no words can convey.\
  \ A pleasant situation filled with expectations, but unlike other times, today I\
  \ am in a Spanish-speaking place. If the worst was to happen, I can still use my\
  \ mother tongue. \nAt the port, a Russian icebreaker ship is preparing before setting\
  \ sail to the white continent. For a moment I wonder what would it be like to visit\
  \ the Antarctica, so close and far at the same time. I thought on coming on board\
  \ and say hi with my harsh Russian skills. \n\"\u041F\u0440\u0438\u0432\u0435\u0442\
  , \u043C\u0435\u043D\u044F \u0437\u043E\u0432\u0443\u0442 Gonzalo\", I rehearse\
  \ to myself. As usual my mind is (over)crowded with ideas, when I realize I have\
  \ to book some interesting tours I've seen on the net. My next trip is tomorrow,\
  \ to the Laguna Esmeralda. Went to bed early and was ready early in the morning\
  \ before the van came to pick me up. All my other mates to be for the day are Argentinian,\
  \ and I'm happy as Uruguayans are basically the same. Basically I can mingle among\
  \ the others without being noticed, just the way I like it. \nSnow refused to melt\
  \ long after winter's ended, and I couldn't help it but smile to this stubborn response\
  \ of nature timing. During our hiking trip I don't need to get introduced on the\
  \ beaver's impact to the landscape, it is brutally explicit. Some green forest areas\
  \ are contrasting with other barren lands that had plenty of dead trees and dry\
  \ wood... like a splattered paint by acclaimed Paul Klee. Only that there was no\
  \ beauty in this paint, that wasn't produced by harmonious hands, but carved with\
  \ teeth. They are the flooded forests by the beaver's colonies, a graveyard that\
  \ stretches yard by yard every moment. What happened with the cute, best hydro engineers\
  \ of the wilderness? Is it true life is on the brink of extinction and now animals\
  \ have gone mad too? Many years ago, people who were slowly populating these inhospitable\
  \ lands thought it would be suitable to bring a harmless animal that it could be\
  \ eaten, whose fur could be used too. It was a win-win situation. And so they decided\
  \ to bring one Canadian variant of this specimen. Beavers here found all the conditions\
  \ to reproduce, and no major natural threat to stop them from doing it. They grew\
  \ bigger, stronger and smarter than the average. In the past I was a staunch believer\
  \ all animals had some role to play in the world, in a micro and macro way alike,\
  \ and that the only kind of being capable of wrong doings was my own. But I was\
  \ wrongly mistaken, and I hate to be redundant with this word: wrong. \nNature has\
  \ proved wiser than humankind most of the times. The genesis of this mistake was\
  \ human, and so should the cure be."
