Text: "That Wednesday I had woken up in Italy and I went to bed in England. My Workaway\
  \ experience was about to start and I felt quite disoriented because of the sudden\
  \ change of country. My hosts had kindly ordered me a taxi so the first person who\
  \ I met at Stansted airport was Jude, my taxi driver. Jude had been given the address\
  \ but it was the first time he was driving a person there. As soon as we got closer\
  \ to my destination road, we both realised that it was a dismal path and there was\
  \ not even a single light along it. When we arrived at the house, Jude asked me\
  \ twice whether I was sure it was the right address. I nodded in astonishment as\
  \ well because the view was very different from the photos my hosts had previously\
  \ sent me since the house looked like an old and eerie castle which conveyed a spooky\
  \ feeling. A massive gate stood in front of us. Two falcon statues of stone were\
  \ staring at us from both sides of the gate, enlightened by two impressive chandeliers\
  \ which cast long, scary shadows on the surrounding garden. I got off the taxi,\
  \ took my luggage with me and said goodbye to Jude who left me despite being seriously\
  \ worried about my safety in that place. In fact, that scenery really intimidated\
  \ me but all fears suddenly went away when Melanie the landlady appeared behind\
  \ the gate and waved hello to me in an extremely welcoming and friendly way. Melanie\
  \ offered me a delicious piece of cake and introduced me to her husband Andy, a\
  \ chubby and cheerful old English man who made me try a glass of excellent sparkling\
  \ wine. It was late at night and they were both dead tired so they showed me my\
  \ room and said goodnight shortly after. When in my room, I met my roommate who\
  \ was a nice American girl called Bailey, a name that clearly reminded me the popular\
  \ Irish cream. One might say that I could have expected funny and exciting moments\
  \ just from that girl\u2019s hilarious name. Still, I was totally unaware of all\
  \ the weird events which later happened and at that point I could do anything but\
  \ sleep like a baby. \nOn the day after I woke up full of energy and I could not\
  \ wait to meet the other Workawayers and spend more time with my hosts in order\
  \ to get to know each other. As soon as I enthusiastically entered the dining room,\
  \ I stopped in disbelief. The other volunteers and Melanie were sitting around a\
  \ table, holding each other hands and saying a sort of prayers to spirits whose\
  \ names I had never heard of before. None of the guys nor Melanie seemed to notice\
  \ my presence so I silently kept observing what was going on from one corner of\
  \ the room. Their eyes were closed and they all looked very into what they were\
  \ doing like it were a matter of life and death. They were invoking the spirits\
  \ to appear in the room or move things in order to make them perceive their presence.\
  \ \u201CBeloved spirits of the house, we are praying to you to get to know you better\
  \ and become friends\u201D \u2013 they said- \u201CWe are not afraid of you and\
  \ please, forgive us for screaming in terror in front of you last night. It was\
  \ a long time that you did not show your figures to us so we were not prepared for\
  \ it. Please, dear members of this house, give us a sign of your presence now\u201D\
  . At that very same time, the door behind me opened all of a sudden and stopped\
  \ right in the middle of its usual rotation as if someone were holding it half-open\
  \ by hand. The spookiest thing was that nobody was there holding it. There was just\
  \ me staring at the half-open door in shock while the other Workawayers and Melanie\
  \ were smiling and joyfully celebrating the successful invocation. I could not believe\
  \ my eyes. I definitively did not expect to find a haunted house and a spiritualist\
  \ bunch of buddies."
