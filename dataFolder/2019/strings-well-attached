Text: "There\u2019s nowhere else in the world like India \u2014 and that goes for\
  \ everything, from its amazing culinary traditions to simply taking the train. India\
  \ has the second-largest rail network on the planet, and it\u2019s estimated that\
  \ 23 million people use the nation\u2019s trains every day. Given its sheer size,\
  \ it\u2019s perhaps no surprise that navigating the trains in India can be confusing.\
  \ And when you add all sorts of variables, from types of trains to the number of\
  \ classes available on any given route, there\u2019s a lot of planning that goes\
  \ into getting around by train. However, with a little bit of savvy \u2014 and our\
  \ handy list of tips below \u2014 you\u2019ll be navigating India\u2019s railways\
  \ like a pro in no time.\n\nBook in advance: India\u2019s railway is relied upon\
  \ heavily for domestic travel, which means that demand for tickets is high. If you\u2019\
  re planning on hitting up the major cities and sights, you should book your tickets\
  \ in advance (especially if your trip is only two or three weeks long). Ticket sales\
  \ open 60 days before the day of departure, and you should aim to buy your ticket\
  \ within the first day or two of any route becoming available. This is especially\
  \ true during the yatra season (which begins in April and runs into the summer)\
  \ and around major festivals like Diwali. During these times, domestic travelers\
  \ are crisscrossing the nation to be with family or making religious pilgrimages.\n\
  Register with Cleartrip Immediately: The most efficient way for international travelers\
  \ to book Indian Railways tickets from abroad is by using Cleartrip.com. The website\
  \ takes most international credit cards and provides an easy-to-navigate way of\
  \ searching routes, classes, and times. However, getting set up with an account\
  \ through Cleartrip will take time and patience, and requires registering with the\
  \ IRCTC as well (Indian Railway Catering and Tourism Corporation). You will need\
  \ a valid passport, which you\u2019ll have to scan and email to the appropriate\
  \ department. Then, over the course of one to several days, you\u2019ll receive\
  \ several emails containing different passwords, all of which you\u2019ll need to\
  \ complete your registration. Once you\u2019re registered, though, Cleartrip is\
  \ the simplest way to score guaranteed tickets in advance of your trip. For a breakdown\
  \ of exactly how to set yourself up for the online ticketing system, check out India\
  \ Mike\u2019s incredibly detailed explanation of the process (and trust us \u2014\
  \ it works).\nDecide which class is right for you: Figuring out what class of ticket\
  \ you should buy can be confusing, partially because the names of each class can\
  \ be a bit deceptive. Let\u2019s start with the basics: Sleeper or Second Class\
  \ are the budget categories on nearly every route, and these carriages make up the\
  \ bulk of most trains. Contrary to the Sleeper class\u2019 name, it\u2019s not exactly\
  \ the most restful option. These cars have open windows and lack air-conditioning,\
  \ and bunks are often so packed with other travelers that laying down may be an\
  \ impossibility. Furthermore, you\u2019ll need to take great pains to secure your\
  \ luggage under the seat with a lock and chain, and should make sure that all of\
  \ your valuables are zipped into compartments underneath your clothing. Still, prices\
  \ on even the longest routes in this class are incredibly low, and many travelers\
  \ find that it\u2019s a fascinating window into how most Indians travel.\nWe suggest\
  \ picking a 2AC ticket. This class is also offered on almost every major route (though\
  \ 3AC is a fine back-up if it isn\u2019t). These carriages are fully air-conditioned\
  \ and the beds come with linens and pillows. They\u2019re arranged in berths, with\
  \ four bunks sharing one side of the aisle, and two sharing the other. During the\
  \ daytime, the lower levels are converted into seats, while at night, people retire\
  \ to their own berths. The most private berths are the upper bunks on the two-bunk\
  \ side of the aisle, as they\u2019re closed off by their own individual curtain\
  \ (the four-bunk berths all share the same curtain separating them from the aisle).\
  \ We strongly discourage booking the lower bunk on the two-bunk side, as you\u2019\
  ll get bumped into by everyone passing along the aisle. Plus, when the seats are\
  \ converted into a bed, there\u2019s a horrible gap that makes sleeping a brutal\
  \ affair. These higher-category carriages are also generally safer when it comes\
  \ to petty theft, though it\u2019s still wise to secure your luggage. Meals are\
  \ available in these categories, though the constant stream of vendors that regularly\
  \ stop by the lower-class carriages will be absent."
