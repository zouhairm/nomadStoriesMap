Text: "Good day,\n\nMyself Umer i visited Netherlands in 2006,The Netherlands has\
  \ many gorgeous places and experiences to offer besides its beautiful capital city.\
  \ So, when you plan your Netherlands itinerary, make sure to include some of these\
  \ awesome day trips from Amsterdam. All of the places mentioned on this list can\
  \ be reached via public transport from Amsterdam in just a few hours, It\u2019s\
  \ also a shopping paradise with its numerous quirky boutique and concept stores.\
  \ In addition, you\u2019ll find a bunch of delightful cafes and restaurants here\
  \ that serve yummy food. That, minus the crowds of tourists you generally see in\
  \ Amsterdam, makes it a perfect choice for a day trip.\nNetherlands is famous for\
  \ its cheese. It makes for one of the best day trips from Amsterdam to Gouda. Every\
  \ Thursday morning from April to late August, there\u2019s the cheese market where\
  \ traders come to buy cheese. It\u2019s pretty interesting to watch and draws many\
  \ tourists.\nThere\u2019s a cheese museum too if you feel like to want to learn\
  \ more about it or you can just wander around and enjoy the beautiful buildings\
  \ and canals. The main square has a lot of cafes and restaurants and sometimes has\
  \ market stalls.\nGouda is easy to reach by train from Amsterdam and takes less\
  \ than an hour. If you want to drive, there are many parking lots around the town.\
  \ However, beware that on a Thursday morning, it can be very busy due to the cheese\
  \ market. Sundays are best if you want a quiet day trip as shops are still open\
  \ but it\u2019s much quieter.\n There are pretty canals, narrow houses, cute bridges,\
  \ plenty of bicycles, flowers everywhere and an extremely liberal culture. It\u2019\
  s the city that\u2019s gateway to Europe for many 20 and 30 something travelers\
  \ who start their Euro trips here.\nYes, Amsterdam is absolutely gorgeous and you\
  \ will not be able to stop yourself from clicking hundreds of photos while you\u2019\
  re there. But it\u2019s not Amsterdam\u2019s beauty that Wows me, it is the fact\
  \ that literally every kind of traveler will find something fun to do here is what\
  \ makes it special. Weather you\u2019re traveling to Amsterdam alone or with your\
  \ family, you will surely enjoy your time here."
