Text: "Bellary District in Karnataka boasts of a place called Hampi which takes us\
  \ back to the Thirteenth Century echoing the tales of the then glorious and flourishing\
  \ Vijayanagar Empire. It was the last Capital of this Hindu Empire. After several\
  \ invasions, it lost it's glory due to human greed for power and acquisition in\
  \ the 16th Century and left behind \u201Cthe Ruins of Hampi\u201D.\n\nIt was 2017\
  \ February, I reached Hampi from Bengaluru by train.I took the Hampi Express at\
  \ 10:00 p.m. which reaches Hospet (13 k.m. from Hampi) at 6:00 a.m. Coming from\
  \ North India even a clean railway station can seem like a tourist spot! My excursion\
  \ had begun the moment I saw a staircase, painted in different colours, with local\
  \ language messages about cleanliness on it.\n\nAs soon as you head out of the railway\
  \ station, an array of auto and cabs drivers surround you to drop you  either to\
  \ a hotel in Hospet or transport you to 13 km away town to Hampi. I stayed in Hospet\
  \ and the first thing the auto driver handed me was a Clear and Simple City Map.\
  \ It was the best tool for navigation as Google Maps did not work properly in many\
  \ places due to weak internet connectivity.\n\nAfter freshening up at Hospet, I\
  \ headed to Hampi. It\u2019s a 30 minute auto ride costing around INR 200-250. You\
  \ know you are in Hampi when on either side of the road you witness huge sepia coloured\
  \ boulders. The broken stones are aligned and placed one over the other in a way\
  \ that they look as if they were specifically placed that way. The architecture\
  \ of the Virupaksha Temple which no one could have imagined back then still stands\
  \ telling tales about the grandeur and mastery of the Vijayanagar artisans but also\
  \ a major part of the place is now just broken stones and monuments which remind\
  \ us of multiple invasions.\n\nIt was spectacular to go under the rock tunnel and\
  \ finally reach the Tungabhadra river crossing. To my surprise, there were hardly\
  \ any Indian travellers here. Mostly , foreigner backpackers were waiting to cross\
  \ over to the other side.I waited under a shed for the boat. The boat ride was barely\
  \ 5 minutes, which finishes by the time the conductor manually collects the ticket\
  \ fare from the passengers.\n\nThere I was on the other side! Paddy rice fields,\
  \ grafittis, narrow lanes and German cafes! Wow, that\u2019s not what I expected\
  \ in this historic town!  I was here to visit the monuments at this World Heritage\
  \ site but this was a different world, frequented by foreigners, yoga and Ayurvedic\
  \ spa centres around every corner and village men and women selling Indian stoles,\
  \ braiding your hair and putting henna on women\u2019s palms. \n\nBest travelled\
  \ on foot to explore the unknown sides of this gem, I stood there breathing in the\
  \ air of the hippie town of Hampi! I relaxed at the Laughing Buddha Cafe. I didn\u2019\
  t know that this city could have this rugged, trance feel to it.The cafe even served\
  \ alcoholic beverages in a steel glass (it's a historical importance town where\
  \ alcohol is banned but I was in India and it was the hippie town where everything\
  \ was available under the table)\n\nAfter a while, at around 3:30 p.m. I rented\
  \ a scooty to ride to the lake side and there I discovered Gandola rides. Youngsters\
  \ did boating in an inverted umbrella shaped boat, listening to music, taking dips\
  \ in the water. I put my headphones on and wondered about the Ruins, the broken\
  \ monuments, the pillars and how this magical mysterious town would have cropped\
  \ up! When I asked the locals about it, they just told me how foreigners made this\
  \ World Heritage site a partying place at night and a peaceful escape in the morning,\
  \ \n\nAs for me, it was time to head back to Hospet now as the last boat out of\
  \ this hippie town was at 5:30 p.m. I was out of the mysterious town transported\
  \ back to reality! This quirky town felt like some place abroad and it will always\
  \ be on my list for a quick getaway from the busy Indian city life!"
