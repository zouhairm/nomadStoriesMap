Text: "I was a 16-year-old High School student when my parents \u2014probably, anticipating\
  \ the XXI century shift of our world\u2014 wanted to send me abroad to an English-speaking\
  \ country to experience my first cultural immersion and prepare me for the future\
  \ by surpassing the limits of our Colombian territory and language. Therefore, I\
  \ enrolled in a program to pursue my senior year in the United States of America.\
  \ \nThe agency sent a package with pictures and a letter from the Mrs. who spoke\
  \ on behalf of the family responding to the one box I sent with pictures of me (this\
  \ was the time of very slow dial-up internet and expensive land phone calls) a letter\
  \ and other information. The people who chose me (a couple with two kids and two\
  \ dogs) lived in Denver. They picked me because of my name; the Mister\u2019s sister\
  \ and I were baptized under the same bravery star, both of us called Valentina at\
  \ birth gave them that Je ne sais qua feeling which convinced them to take me. They\
  \ lived in the Highlands area of the northern part of the city which in turn meant\
  \ I would attend the school on the north side. \nFeeling static, I packed my bags\
  \ and my dreams for a trip to Colorful Colorado; ready to see my life changing forever.\
  \ On August 11th, 2002, I landed at the airport and had my first significant shock:\
  \ all those years of studying English had not prepared me well enough to face the\
  \ cashier at McDonald's, despite being hungry my nerves got the best of me. The\
  \ words she muttered at the speed of light were as unknown to me as the local culture\
  \ or my way into the city. In a panic, and to avoid looking like a moron, I decided\
  \ to order a soda. O dear, when she went and asked what size I wanted, my knees\
  \ were shaking and I, sweating. Did I have exact change? \u201CO no, please let\u2019\
  s get this over with,\u201D I thought to myself. \u201CWhere am I? and what have\
  \ I done?\u201D, I added. However, since courage is my name, I knew I was ready\
  \ to face everything that came my way with the best attitude possible. \nBy Christmas\
  \ that year, I had accustomed to my new living, and I loved it. Nevertheless, the\
  \ situation behind doors was not comfortable: I was always forced to do chores around\
  \ the house and hated having to mop the floors on my knees with vinegar. The family\
  \ always seemed tense, and they would fight frequently. I wanted out, and my parents\
  \ thought the agency\u2019s service should improve, so they contacted the agency,\
  \ and the representative, in turn, contacted me to talk about whether I would like\
  \ to be transferred. I told her yes. She said looking for a different family could\
  \ mean a change in area and that implied a change of schools, so I dropped it. One\
  \ Saturday morning, without me expecting it because the Mrs. found out and felt\
  \ betrayed, I found myself homeless. With my rep\u2019s help, I contacted my friend\
  \ and neighbor Emily, asked her to pick me up before rehearsal (she and I both were\
  \ part of the School\u2019s musical play cast). She arranged with her parents to\
  \ take me in for the rest of the year and provide me with warmth and care.\nSoon\
  \ after we became a family, one I had to leave by the end of the school year, I\
  \ then lived the next 16 years, dreaming of the day we would meet again. They are\
  \ my family, and that\u2019s my blessing. Our connection from all those years ago\
  \ keeps on growing. This year, they opened their home to me again: The same house,\
  \ few changes around the neighborhood, and our bond stronger. Love is ageless. I\
  \ also reunited with classmates, and it was as if time had never passed us, sure\
  \ our lives had taken many turns, but we could still link our understandings, relate\
  \ to each other\u2019s experiences and enjoy blizzard days by building snowmen.\
  \ I also visited those who first opened their home to me, and made peace over bean\
  \ burritos, coffee, and conversation."
