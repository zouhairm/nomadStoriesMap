Text: "Meandering through Mozambique' s  sleepy grasslands in an overloaded 4x4 vehicle\
  \ quickly turns into a tropical frenzy of palm trees and street vendors selling\
  \ anything from equatorial fruits, honeyed nuts and  African style beachware, the\
  \ latter often boasting the country's proud local brew - Doshem. \n\nA prior Portuguese\
  \ colony, Mozambique's  bubbling coastal atmosphere is still home to a few incredible\
  \ pieces of arcitectural artwork which seem somewhat lost to a forgone era. However,\
  \ between singing to UB 40s cover of Red Red Wine and bartering for each lump of\
  \ pow bread at the local markets,  it's easy to miss out on the deeply moving, and\
  \ somewhat sombre history of this small East African country.\n\nEmbarking on a\
  \ thrifty tropical adventure, I never expected to find and experience  such humbling\
  \ insight into a part of the country's history such as I was able to when exploring\
  \ the haunted hallways of the legendary Choengoene Hotel. \n\nNestled between the\
  \ sand dunes, only a few kilometers from the town of Xai-Xai, the remnants of this\
  \ impressive multi-story resort form the  1970's now endures it's magnificent ocean\
  \ view in complete isolation. It's once proud Portuguese owners had fled with little\
  \ more than the clothes on their backs and returned to their home country in order\
  \ to escape a bloody  execution by Frelomo soldiers after the announcement of the\
  \ infamous 24/20 order. But, as history would have it, not every European family\
  \ was fortunate enough to reach the country's boarders within the 24 'grace period'\
  \ provided which the order provided for them to escape after Mozambique declared\
  \ its independenxe form portuguese rule. These are the lonely spirits of the family\
  \ who sought shelter in the Choengoene hotel and were brutally murdered within it's\
  \ doors.\n\nThe crumbling cement entrance at the back of the building, as well as\
  \ the dark and eery hallways leading up to the sleeping quarters thicken the haunted\
  \ aura of the hotel. \n\nOutside, the elongated front patio, with all it's cracks\
  \ and unearthing weeds, is still adorned with massive pillars decorated with turquoise\
  \ mosaic, all of which have began to wither from prolonged exposure to the tropical\
  \ climate. Most of the huge ocean-facing windows have also had their panes knocked\
  \ out, making the sparkling walkway below strangely enchanting.\n\nEven the onshore\
  \ wind howling through the building connects one to the reality that this piece\
  \ of Portuguese arcitecture played host to some unforgettable memories of visitors\
  \ who experienced Africa's coastal paradise in absolute luxury and abundance,  but\
  \ it simultaneously locks away tales of great tragedy and loss for many who called\
  \ this part of the world their home before the mid 1970's\n\nAs we embark on our\
  \ trek back to the backpackers, the hotel slowly sinks back into the sandy hollows\
  \ of the beach. For a moment I feel guilty for leaving seemingly just as my predecessors,\
  \ the Portuguese , who had long ago frolicked in its ballroom, toasted to good health\
  \ in its dining halls and tanned on the patio.\n\n Perhaps we had all given up to\
  \ easily on this soulful resort by the seaside... but the Portuguese sealed the\
  \ old Choengoene's fate long ago. They poured cement down the pipe works just before\
  \ heading out on their ships- Somewhat of a going away present for the locals who\
  \ may have intended to utilise the facilities post independence!\n\nToday, though,\
  \ the tropical sunset capturing the silhouettes of the palm trees and the dows on\
  \ the water restores a sense of peace to the land,  and lays to rest the war riddled\
  \ realities of a paradise lost."
