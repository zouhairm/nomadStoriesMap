Text: "Since I was little I adored seeking adventure, \nExploring new places have\
  \ been a great source of inspiration with my writing.\nThere are many ways to explore\
  \ the world such as reading, writing and traveling...\nThat's why I'm so attached\
  \ to write about far away places so my mind do the wandering...\nBut my feet can't\
  \ stand still, they crave to explore unknown lands, filled with beautiful views\
  \ such as a deep reddish sunset with dyes of purple and pink and evergreen meadows\
  \ that seem to never die.  My hair wants to feel the salty breeze from the alluring\
  \ sea, as my eyes can contemplate the diverse shades of blue, that get lighter as\
  \ the raving waves kiss the sand and I'll want to feel the moist sand on my toes\
  \ as I walk nearby as the wanderer I am.  \n\nThe wold is beautiful and it's ours\
  \ for us to take that leap and explore it's wonders,\n To enrich ourselves with\
  \ different cultures, learn about each nations history, \n Taste the finest meals\
  \ and take a glimpse of breathtaking realms.\n\nI would like to find new inspirations\
  \ so in my writing I can convey those experiences and feelings I had when I was\
  \ roaming those lands."
