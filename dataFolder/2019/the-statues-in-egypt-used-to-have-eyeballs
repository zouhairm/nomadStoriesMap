Text: "In 2005, the Cairo Museum was a mess in the best way. Hardly anything was labeled,\
  \ statues leaned against walls, artifacts were piled on top of each other, dust\
  \ everywhere. It was a treasure trove of ancient mysteries, a complete playground\
  \ for a starry-eyed 15-year-old such as myself.\n\nWhen I returned to Egypt 12 years\
  \ later, the museum had changed. Someone had tidied up. Gone were the piles and\
  \ the dust and the ambiguity. Everything had a place and a label. It shouldn\u2019\
  t have surprised me that the museum had gotten a spruce-up, but it was still disappointing.\n\
  \nAs I was guided through the heavy crowds, I felt excited to be back, but I missed\
  \ some of the old magic of this place. \n\nThen my tour guide, Emil, showed us the\
  \ most life-like statue I\u2019d ever seen. A bald, bull-necked priest with a staff.\
  \ You could almost see him breathing. And when he shined a flashlight into the eyes\u2026\
  \ they moved.\n\nWe gasped.\n\n\u201CStatues in Egypt used to have eyes,\u201D Emil\
  \ said. \u201CThe glass-and-crystal eyes are so realistic, modern ophthalmologists\
  \ cannot duplicate them. They're very rare today.\u201D\n\nHe shuffled us over to\
  \ a pair of statues, a Pharaoh and his Queen, and lit up their eyes too.\n\n\u201C\
  You see? Eyes. As real as yours or mine.\u201D\n\nWait a minute. Throughout history,\
  \ Egyptian statues had realistic inlaid glass eyes? I was so used to blank faces!\
  \ I'd always thought that far-off, pupil-less gaze was the style. It gave them a\
  \ quality of being between worlds. You could examine their faces so intimately because\
  \ they weren\u2019t looking back. They were too busy seeing what we might only see\
  \ in death.\n\nBut not these statues. These statues were ALIVE. \n\nCan you imagine\
  \ eyes on all the ancient statues? Eyes so real, they looked like they might blink\
  \ any minute? Can you imagine eyes on the Sphinx? My god, we\u2019ve been so foolishly\
  \ focused on the nose! My head was reeling with the implications. This was rocking\
  \ my whole world. \n\nEmil began to leave and that\u2019s when I laid eyes on a\
  \ statue that stopped me in my tracks. A young man sitting cross-legged, leaning\
  \ forward. He was staring right. at. me. His gray eyes held such depth, I couldn\u2019\
  t possibly be looking at a statue. This was a person. I felt like I could reach\
  \ out and brush the clay from his cheek and it would be warm. We were reaching through\
  \ time - an existential acknowledgment of each other.\n\nI snapped a photo and ran\
  \ to catch up with Emil.\n\n\u201CWhy don\u2019t the other statues have eyes?\u201D\
  \ I asked breathlessly.\n\nEmil was distracted, making sure we had everybody. \u201C\
  People break them, steal them. A statue is a house for a dead person\u2019s soul.\
  \ You take the eyes, they cannot see.\u201D\n\nSo Egypt was filled with blind souls\
  \ trapped in statues? I pulled up the picture I\u2019d taken. \u201CWho\u2019s this?\u201D\
  \n\n\u201CHim?\u201D Emil shrugged. \u201CA scribe.\u201D\n\nMy heart was pounding.\
  \ I\u2019m a writer. This is fate. \u201CCan you tell me about him?\u201D\n\nHe\
  \ nodded at my picture. \u201CThat one\u2019s a drunk, look at his eyes.\u201D\n\
  \nI looked at the picture. What? No. He looked sad, perhaps. Or tired. But not...\
  \ Ok\u2026 on second inspection, he did look a little inebriated. The whites of\
  \ his eyes were a bit red and one eye drooped. (Under the influence of divine inspiration,\
  \ maybe?)\n\n\u201CHe\u2019s a joke,\u201D Emil chuckled. \u201CWe joke about him.\
  \ The drunk scribe, gonna fall over any second.\u201D\n\nTourist astonishment and\
  \ awe, dashed against the rocks by the very tour guide who was supposed to covet\
  \ it. You may be thinking- So what if he\u2019s drunk? Further proof he\u2019s a\
  \ scribe! Yeah, I know. It\u2019s just\u2026 when you make a trans-dimensional connection\
  \ with someone, you hope they're sober enough to explain. Can you imagine if God\
  \ had been drunk when he ambushed Moses? \n\nSo perhaps I hadn\u2019t made a connection\
  \ with a long-dead kindred spirit. I\u2019m sure I\u2019m not the only entitled\
  \ white lady to imagine statues in Egypt were waiting for me. But I'm thrilled to\
  \ have discovered that, even when you think you've lost the magic, it's often staring\
  \ you right in the face."
