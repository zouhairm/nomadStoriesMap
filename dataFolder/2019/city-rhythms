Text: "\u2018Gridlock\u2019 doesn\u2019t even come close. Nearly two hours have passed\
  \ since I left the airport, and our minibus has barely made a dent in the thick,\
  \ crawling traffic that stifles Lagos' sprawling highways. Outstretched arms thrust\
  \ ice-cold bottles of water through the rolled-down windows, and I gladly hand over\
  \ a five hundred naira note ($1) to one particularly industrious street hawker who,\
  \ with her free hand, clasps a metal tray of groundnuts to her head in a remarkable\
  \ balancing act.\n\nI have come to Nigeria's largest city with a group of fellow\
  \ singers from my university in London. Evening falls, and as the seemingly endless\
  \ throng of faded yellow-and-white Danfo shuttle buses begins to thin out, I cast\
  \ my thoughts ahead to our first concert. Although I know admittedly little about\
  \ Nigerian music, I am excited to be singing with the Muson choir, widely celebrated\
  \ as one of the best vocal groups not only in Nigeria, but across the continent.\
  \ Arriving at the Muson centre, a bright and airy arts complex situated in the heart\
  \ of Lagos Island, we are met by members of the choir sporting ocean-blue kaftans\
  \ and red necklaces made with coral beads. The female singers\u2019 outfits are\
  \ complemented by their matching red gele, elaborate cloth head-ties studded with\
  \ white pearls. This is probably the first time that I\u2019ve felt underdressed\
  \ in a smart grey suit, and during the pre-concert photoshoot I kick myself for\
  \ not going with a more colourful tie.\n\nThree intense hours of rehearsals later\
  \ and the two choirs are ready to perform. The programme is a mixture of European\
  \ classical favourites (think Handel\u2019s Hallelujah Chorus), and West African\
  \ highlife music, a foot-stomping blend of Ghanian and Nigerian percussion, Western\
  \ jazz, and calypso rhythms borrowed from as far afield as Cuba. Our Muson counterparts\u2019\
  \ performance is a riot of colour, smiles, dancing, and most importantly, brilliant\
  \ musicianship. Their efforts have the whole audience on their feet, clapping along.\
  \ This is not the how the audience usually reacts when I perform the Messiah in\
  \ London\u2026\n\nTaking it in turns to present famous pieces from our respective\
  \ choral traditions, we wrap up the concert with a show of unity that encapsulates\
  \ the purpose of our entire trip: to show that music can break down borders. We\
  \ mix together on stage with the Muson choir, the bright colours of their kaftans\
  \ popping out against our dark suits. Together, we perform \u2018Messiah Baba Mi\u2019\
  , a stirring hymn written by Ayo Oluranti, a Nigerian who, rather fittingly, studied\
  \ composition in England. After the event, we celebrate over palm wine and English\
  \ cider. The focus on cross-cultural sharing extends, it seems, to alcohol as well\
  \ as music. \n\nThe next morning, I wake up with the aftertaste of sweet palm wine\
  \ sticky on my tongue, and the heady beats of highlife music still ringing in my\
  \ head. Remembering the thump-thump of the shekere, the hollowed-out gourd used\
  \ to accompany the choir\u2019s upbeat numbers, seems to be making my headache worse,\
  \ and throughout the rest of the trip, the beat sticks with me. I hear it in the\
  \ loud, vibrant market near the cathedral, blaring from a shopkeeper\u2019s dusty\
  \ radio over rumbling motorbike engines and honking horns. At a singing workshop\
  \ with schoolchildren in leafy downtown Ikoyi, a couple of the more outgoing kids\
  \ put on their favourite highlife tracks to show us their dance moves. Nigeria really\
  \ is a country defined by its love for music.\n\nHeading back to the airport early\
  \ on our final day, the congested chokehold of rush-hour traffic threatens to make\
  \ us miss check-in, but I am unconcerned. As the thin streams of morning light start\
  \ to heat up the minibus, I wind the window down, and from the stereo of the yellow-and-white\
  \ Danfo shuttle trapped in the gridlock alongside us, I catch faint strains of highlife,\
  \ the rhythms by now familiar and welcoming. I catch myself smiling, and turn my\
  \ attention once more to the music, foot still tapping."
