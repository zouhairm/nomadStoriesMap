Text: "Everybody that goes to Paris for the first-time basically try or expect to\
  \ visit the same all tourist famous places. Obviously is a great opportunity to\
  \ live all the scene movies, I particularly  must confess that I was one of that.\n\
  In 2017 I went for a few days to visit a friend, but it takes almost 3 months, it\
  \ was the love for the first sight. \nI never knew a place like this before, I thought\
  \ in my mind how come every single street and avanue could have apparently the same\
  \ taste but in a different clothes.\nLouvre, Gallery Lafayette, Jardins du Luxemburg,\
  \ Trocadero, Place V\xEAndome, Sacre Coer, Moulin Rouge and Versalles  are places\
  \ that really not be missed, but Paris is more than a touristic charming city for\
  \ the lovers.\nFor those like me who loves song, there is a lots of historical cemeteries\
  \ that's ideal to visit and knowing more about your favorite composer, artists and\
  \ singer.\nMontmatre for example, certainly should have a little part of this neighborhood\
  \ dedicated for divas tribute. There wasn't only bohemian painters, imagine walking\
  \ around and then make a stop in front of a Dalida's house, or have a chance to\
  \ see the France Galls tombstone made of glass, hear any gossip about Musidora.This\
  \ village besides having great restaurants and cafes, it's a place to sing and dream\
  \ of being a star.\nA sweet little tip, is to make a pit stop in a small pub called\
  \ Marlusse et Lapin, there, you can appreciate a drink, hear a good music. This\
  \ pub is far three blocks away the legendary Moulin Rouge, perfect for who wants\
  \ to extend a night watching a typical french show.\nAnother sensation of the parisian\
  \ night, it's a village called Le Marais, better know of being a mixed of jewish\
  \ and a gay neighborhood, the nightlife is full of discos, pubs and bars with a\
  \ dragqueen and talent shows. \nThere you can find at Banana Caf\xE9, Stella Rocha\
  \ a character from the parisian night, that could inform the days and the best places\
  \ to watch this shows.\nCharming, Paris is the right choice for all tastes, just\
  \ define which route you want to do!"
