Text: "Since I was a child, coming from a small town named El Tabo, on the Coast of\
  \ Poets of Chile. I had the dream to travel and visit many countries all over the\
  \ world, to learn about other cultures, languages and other traditions. And I made\
  \ it, I did my studies in tourism in Chile and after finish I went to travel. Were\
  \ 7 years, 28 countries and hundred of new friends in different continents and was\
  \ the most amazing experience in my life.\nOnce I returned to my hometown, with\
  \ new ideas and different perception of the world, I saw how wonderful is the region\
  \ where I am from and how lucky I am to have all my root connected to this land.\n\
  For generations my family has always lived in this beautiful land, keeping the traditions\
  \ and telling me stories about our ancestry. Then I though, \"This has to be known\
  \ by other people in the world\". The same I had the chance when I was travelling\
  \ and other people showed me nicely. \nMy land is named the Coast of Poets, named\
  \ like that due to 3 known Chilean poets that found in this land a place for inspiration.\
  \ Pablo Neruda, Nicanor Parra and Vicente Huidobro. \nAll of them chose this quite\
  \ place to live for the stunning views of the Pacific Ocean, their relation to the\
  \ Sea and the peacefulness that the town life has to offer; lost in between the\
  \ coast, cliffs, wetlands, forests, gorges and people. People that with their own\
  \ hands built this territory.\nThe Coast is few miles away from Valpara\xEDso and\
  \ Santiago. Our traditions are connected to fishing, handicrafts, country-work and\
  \ religion.\nWe have small towns in the country side in middle of valleys and hills,\
  \ are El Totoral and Lo Abarca. Places were you can see the town life with a colony\
  \ style, eat the best chilean food as \"Chancho a la Chilena\" (English: Pork in\
  \ Chilean style), drink different types of handmade liquors, see their old churches,\
  \ have a tour in a winery or have a carriage ride.\nBy the coast the small towns\
  \ El Tabo, El Quisco, Algarrobo, Cartagena live mainly of the sea products, were\
  \ you can eat them fresh. The same as Pablo Neruda loved the seafood and created\
  \ the Oda al Caldillo de Congrio (English: Ode to Conger Chowder). The towns show\
  \ us the past, with amazing constructions, old houses where the aristocracy in XX\
  \ century used to have for holidays and now in time they left behind leaving an\
  \ interesting tasting the past and future in our eyes. \nThe nature is amazing and\
  \ is possible to make a lot of hikes around. Like in Quebrada de Cordova Gorge,\
  \ El Peral Lagoon, big Wetlands El Yali, Tunquen, Cartagena and Algarrobo where\
  \ is possible to do a great bird-watching. \nThe Coast of Poets is a peaceful and\
  \ beautiful place undiscovered destination in the world. Were until now only Chileans\
  \ appreciate, what are you waiting for, take your travelbag and come and visit \
  \ this unique place in Chile!"
