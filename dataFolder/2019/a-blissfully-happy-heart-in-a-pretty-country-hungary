Text: "As a graduate student from one of the great universities in Hungary, I call\
  \ this pretty country as my second home. I left my heart there and went home with\
  \ uncountable gorgeous memories. \nIt was my first time travel abroad. I started\
  \ this journey without knowing a lot of things about Hungary. The thing that I knew,\
  \ Hungary is known as the heart of Europe. And then, I decided to come, I saw, and\
  \ I unexpectedly fell in love with this country.\nI stayed in a very comfortable\
  \ city, Veszpr\xE9m. I adore this city very much, it has clean and nice environment\
  \ and beautiful nature which encouraged me to explore this country more by expecting\
  \ more surprises.  Therefore, not even one month living there, I travelled to the\
  \ capital city, Budapest. I strolled around the city and visited some tourist spots.\
  \ \nWow! I did not expect this country as fancy as it with a very beautiful and\
  \ elegant capital city. Well, I knew it has Danube River and some beautiful bridges\
  \ from Google, but trust me, you will amaze all of these beautiful spots more when\
  \ you saw them real right in front of your eyes. Moreover, this capital city is\
  \ not really crowded; it is a big city, but calm and comfortable. \nFirstly, my\
  \ friends and I went to the fanciest and famous building in this country, the Parliament\
  \ building. We walked around the building while wondering how great life inside\
  \ there. We enjoyed some times, sitting on the bench in front of this building.\
  \ And then, we moved to the back side, staring at the Danube River which gave us\
  \ comfortable feeling while looking at it. From this side, we could see some other\
  \ beautiful buildings on the cross side of the river.\nNot enough with this adorable\
  \ building, we continued our adventure to the places that we saw on the other side.\
  \ In order to make it faster, we took Metro and bus to the Mathias Church, a Roman\
  \ Catholic Church with a graceful architecture. It was difficult to describe how\
  \ we amazed this pretty church very much. It has a very tall turret which you need\
  \ to make good strategies if you want to include all part of this turret as the\
  \ background of your picture (as we did). Moreover, the beautiful colored roofs\
  \ of this Church make it more attractive. Local people told us that this church\
  \ is active as a place with concerts, wedding, and tourism place.\nFrom this gothic\
  \ church, we walked to Fisherman\u2019s Bastion, in front of the Mathias Church.\
  \ It has lookout towers where we could see the beautiful view of Budapest. When\
  \ the sun was going down, the day was turning to be darker, this middle ages building\
  \ offered us a full of light and romantic landscape. We could even see a fancy Parliament\
  \ building with its brightness from this side. It is seen like huge pretty golden\
  \ chunks from here. Besides that, we could watch the beauty of Danube River with\
  \ light reflection from some buildings and bridges that gave lights made this city\
  \ looks very luxurious. \nWe did not stop our journey yet, from this place, we spent\
  \ some times at Buda Castle which offered us very beautiful and romantic landscape\
  \ as well. Yes, actually Mathias Church and Fisherman\u2019s Bastion are part of\
  \ Buda Castle, so we could visit them by our feet.\nTo find more happiness, we took\
  \ bus and metro to Batthy\xE1ni t\xE9r to have dinner in one of the favourite restaurants\
  \ with its best Palascinta, a famous and typical Hungarian pancake. \nAfter that,\
  \ we decided to continue this romantic and lovely night, we strolled around the\
  \ river\u2019s bank. We ended up sitting on the liberty bridge, having a very nice\
  \ talk while enjoying nice view and weather. We stayed till the late night without\
  \ being afraid of transportation for going home, because this city has late night\
  \ bus. We made lists to visit, like Citadella, Normafa hill, and also fancy city\
  \ centre. \nWell, it was an unforgettable trip, we saw and enjoyed beautiful Budapest\
  \ from each side. I had a very lovely day with my lovely ones in this lovely city.\
  \ What a blissful heart!"
