Text: "Sometimes I don't understand how I end up in such frightening but incredible\
  \ situations. \n\nI've learned to expect the unexpected. \n\nLive life in each moment\
  \ and aspire to make as many connections as possible with the people I encounter.\
  \ \n\nConnecting to others has always been essential to me because I have never\
  \ fully connected to myself. My father was born in Portugal but detached himself\
  \ from his family and moved to Montreal before I was born. I grew up not understanding\
  \ my passions, aspirations, and overflowing creativity. \n\nI went on a Europe trip\
  \ with my fellow classmates to explore Italy and Greece. I was gushing with excitement\
  \ to get a taste of my European roots. \n\nI always felt alien to those around me.\
  \ \n\nMy memories of Europe are filled with cafes, bistros and leisurely strolls\
  \ along cobblestone paths. Perhaps my most fond memory is visiting the island of\
  \ Capri, beautifully isolated and devoted to swooning travellers. Not only did the\
  \ picturesque island allure tourists; the locals were eager to develop relations\
  \ of their own\n\nSitting in a local pizzeria and basking in the Italian sun, a\
  \ tall, dark and handsome man approached me. He gently kissed me on the cheek, whispered\
  \ sweet nothings in my ear and gave me his business card.\n\nSafe to say I fell\
  \ in love with the island. \n\nRosey and reckless, I later purchased an outrageously\
  \ expensive bottle of perfume.\n\nI lost his business card the same day, leaving\
  \ it at the boutique where I splurged on myself.\n\nYears later, I noticed that\
  \ the bottle of perfume bore a detachable plastic figurine of Cupid and his bow.\n\
  \nLooks like Cupid had other plans for me. \n\nSelf love is key."
