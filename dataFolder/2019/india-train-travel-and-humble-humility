Text: "The mission began, to replace the passport that was undoubtedly taken  While\
  \ the passport thief was cashing in, me and my travel partner were sent on an adventure\
  \ way outside of our comfort zones.\n\nTime was scarce as the departing flight was\
  \ in less than a week, it was the weekend in two days, and Christmas on Tuesday.\
  \ \n\nMy strength was about to be tested in a way I had never experienced before.\
  \ We hopped on the next night bus and arrived to the Canadian Consulate in Mumbai\
  \ who advised us to head to Delhi for faster processing.\n\nDelhi isn\u2019t the\
  \ top destination for a lot of travellers, it\u2019s just the hub for flights. I\
  \ am not even exaggerating when I say: imagine the apocalypse, grey dusty streets,\
  \  few trees, no fresh air, and WAY to many people. The complete opposite of the\
  \ lovely beach we were hanging out on when the stealthy thief did their job.\n\n\
  We walked up to the ticket counter surrounded by yelling, hectic, Indians all trying\
  \ to purchase theirs as well. The sales counter told us there were no spots left\
  \ on ANY of the trains. We would have to purchase the lowest class ticket and wait\
  \ 8 hours until that train came.\n\nNo seats, and a whole LOT of people. This was\
  \ all we had, no choice.\n\nWe were scared.\n\nThe lowest class would mean we would\
  \ be one of the hundreds of people packed in like sardines. Without seats or working\
  \ toilets, let alone personal breathing space. We made a vow that only one of us\
  \ would sleep at a time and we took the upost caution to secure our valuables.\n\
  \nIn the 8 hour waiting period we found an english speaking employee of the station\
  \ who advised us to get on the next lowest class and just pay the fine that would\
  \ be imposed. He explained we wouldn\u2019t have seats, but at least we would have\
  \ a little standing space.\n\nThe train pulled up at 1:15am and we hustled in. While\
  \ everyone was sleeping in their designated spots the rest of us found whatever\
  \ space we could. I found a spot on the cool floor and sat up straight, reading\
  \ my book, meditating and then finally catching a few winks when I couldn\u2019\
  t keep my eyes open any longer.\n\nWhen morning came and the folks whom I was sitting\
  \ around started to awaken I was pushed to the middle of where the two trains met\
  \ and 4 bathrooms were located. Us \u201Cstanding class\u201D stood here for many\
  \ hours, no windows, no seats and with air that smelled of the toilet.\n\nAfter\
  \ 8 hours of the 16 hour train ride we had finally secured a spot where someones\
  \ cargo was previously sitting. We were amped on this new space as we could take\
  \ turns sitting on a plastic bag as well as peering through the crack of light that\
  \ came every so often as the cars moved around bends.\n\nJust as we thought our\
  \ new found space couldn\u2019t get any better  a passenger came and told us there\
  \ were seats if we would like to sit down. OF COURSE WE DID! \n\nThe people with\
  \ the assigned seats had woken up, felt compassion for us standing class and offered\
  \ to share their beds with us.\n\nWhen I saw down on a top bunk sharing with two\
  \ other men the chai and samosas sellers started to walk through. As we shared smiles\
  \ and chai my heart melted. I went from a cold hard seat and a hungry belly to a\
  \ warm plush seat and a full belly. \n\nPeople were singing, sharing food and lots\
  \ of laughs. Tears welled up in my eyes and I felt a wash of gratitude and safety\
  \ come over me. There was a love in this train car I had never felt before. A lesson\
  \ of true human nature in its absolute capacity to be kind. I didn\u2019t expect\
  \ to find this understanding of humble humility on my trip to India. \n\nEverything\
  \ ended up working out, we replaced the passport and our journey to India was sealed\
  \ with a memory of its true chaotic and beautiful nature."
