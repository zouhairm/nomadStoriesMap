Text: "\u201CTavrika is a large and very remarkable island, having many peoples ...\
  \ They say that Osiris, who harnessed bulls, plowed the land, and from this pair\
  \ of bulls people received their name\u201D.\n(Neoplatonic philosopher Stephen of\
  \ Byzantine, VI century AD)\n\nThe history of this beautiful and harsh land began\
  \ many centuries before our era. That days people called it Tavrika, that is, the\
  \ land where the ancient people Taurians lived. The Latin word Taurus, meaning \u201C\
  calf\u201D, became the name of this nation.\nSince those ancient times many centuries\
  \ have passed. Generations succeeded generations. Since ancient times, many cultures\
  \ have left traces here. Due to the exceptional natural and geographical properties,\
  \ Tavrika has always attracted people to itself. Cultures crossed here and over\
  \ the millennia traces of different peoples were saved: Taurians, Kimmereans, Scythians,\
  \ Sarmatians, Romans, Goths, Huns, Khazars, Pechenegs, Polovtsy, Armenians, Alans,\
  \ Russians, Mongols, Tatars, Turks, Genoese, Circassians, English, Germans and others\
  \ peoples.\nTavrika was a place where feats were accomplished and significant events\
  \ of dozens, and maybe hundreds, of ancient Greek myths, legends of the Crimean\
  \ Tatars, works of ancient philosophers took place.\nNow this land is called peninsula\
  \ of Crimea. Here every meter of land breathes with history, and nature still hides\
  \ incredible and stunning beauties from prying eyes and have survived to our days.\n\
  The peninsula in Soviet times was a favorite platform for filmmakers. Here you can\
  \ find everything: from boundless dry steppes to snowy mountains; from ancient cave\
  \ cities and wells to rocky seashores, which are not inferior to Portuguese ones;\
  \ from pink salty lakes to deep autumn shades of the stormy sea that famous painter\
  \ Aivazovsky loved to draw.\nWe will travel to a magical land that is little known\
  \ to Europeans and Americans. For several months the author of the article studied\
  \ historical objects and natural locations. And only every time you come here you\
  \ realize that you have studied only a millimeter of the peninsula. Always thanks\
  \ to local residents or other sources it is possible to find even more unknown places.\
  \ Because people don't know them it allowes them to remain beautiful and virgin\
  \ until now."
