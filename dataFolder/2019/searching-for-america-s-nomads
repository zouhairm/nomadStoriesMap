Text: "Images of Nomads may be firmly grounded in America\u2019s frontier past, but\
  \ the spirit of the American west lives on through communities and events offering\
  \ escapism from our modern lives.\n\nIf you tailed a wondering Gutter Punk across\
  \ tracks that scar America you would eventually find yourself in a lawless desert\
  \ town or spiritual festival, where nomads from all walks of life create new networks,\
  \ share stories and party. These symbolically chaotic communities don\u2019t rely\
  \ on money, branding or influencers and are one of the last remaining safe havens\
  \ from the grind of modern America.\n\nIn the Mohave Desert, one of the hottest\
  \ and driest places in the world, you will find Slab City, known as the \u201Clast\
  \ free place in America\u201D. It was once a marine base and gained its name from\
  \ the empty remnants of its buildings. In the evenings you can hear explosions from\
  \ the testing ground nearby. If it were in a city it might be called a slum, but\
  \ out in the desert this rag-tag colony of vehicles is simply an accumulation of\
  \ peoples without a home. \n\nSlab City has two distinct qualities: it\u2019s completely\
  \ free to live and completely lawless. This is thanks to disagreements over land\
  \ ownership, making Slab City a TAZ: A Temporary Autonomous Zone, which exists outside\
  \ of the normal laws which govern society. It is an example of one of the anarchic\
  \ anomalies which can occur in America. It even appeared in the award winning film\
  \ \u2018Into the Wild\u2019.   \nRainbow Gatherings channel the spirit of the Nomad\
  \ through their free love and free entry.  These events are organised by the not-for-profit\
  \ \u2018Council of the Rainbow Family of Living Light\u2019, taking place in a different\
  \ location every year, with the most recent event held in Georgia. These gatherings\
  \ are a chance to discuss issues which effect nomadic peoples, and preach a mantra\
  \ of peace and love.\nDifferent churches and temples set up tents offering food\
  \ and company, but the organisation itself doesn\u2019t follow any political or\
  \ religious cause, in fact some say they are the \u2018largest non-organisation\
  \ of non-members in the world\u2019. These festivals are run completely by volunteers,\
  \ who offer a range of stalls and events, from tobacco lounges (where you can buy\
  \ as little as a single roll), to veteran\u2019s camps, helping home nomadic war\
  \ veterans for the duration of the festival.  Sadly, the US Forest Service is in\
  \ near-constant conflict with the Rainbow Family, and has been dubbed a \u2018propaganda\
  \ machine\u2019 for trying to pass new regulations making the gatherings illegal.\
  \ We will have to wait and see if there will be a new festival in 2019. \nEvery\
  \ year Nevada\u2019s Black Rock Desert becomes a temporary home to tens of thousands\
  \ at Burning Man. Burning Man is a temporary city with no scheduled acts or corporate\
  \ sponsorship, instead it\u2019s a community of citizens connected by a subculture\
  \ who gather together to create spontaneous expression. It\u2019s \u2018not a festival\u2019\
  , though its world-wide reputation and online ticket sales are in conflict with\
  \ its image as a \u201Cdecommodified\u201D space. What started as a community gathering\
  \ in one of the loneliest places in America, Burning Man now attracts a city worth\
  \ of people into the desert. This new commercial angle sets Burning Man apart from\
  \ Slab City and Rainbow Gathering, as tickets sell for hundreds of dollars, outpricing\
  \ the true Nomad and enticing the 9-5 worker with the promise of personal and spiritual\
  \ enlightenment.   \n\nThanks to modern societal pressures, the land stretches for\
  \ many thousands of miles between oases where American Nomads can create community.\
  \ Now, havens like Slab City only exist because of land disputes, events like the\
  \ Rainbow Gathering are finding it harder to find venues, and the biggest events\
  \ like Burning Man creep towards conformity."
