Text: "Good Morning,\n\nMy name is Gabrielle Herman. I apologize for the length of\
  \ this e-mail.\n\nOn March 5, 2005, five days before my birthday, my father, SGT\
  \ Richard Herman was hit by an Improvised Explosive Device (IED) while serving the\
  \ US Army during the Iraqi War with the 42nd Infantry Division (NY). In 2008, his\
  \ medical description read: Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder with alcohol/drug abuse\
  \ and traumatic brain injury (also claimed as depression, an adjustment disorder,\
  \ and a personality disorder). Approximately one year later, my love and need for\
  \ him was silenced by his powerful need to end to his pain. He was found unresponsive\
  \ in his bed as a result of an adverse reaction to combined effects of methadone,\
  \ hydrocodone, and ethanol, exposing us to the pain and darkness that earned him\
  \ numerous military medals, decorations, and awards, including one of the most recognized\
  \ and respected: The Military Order of the Purple Heart (MOPH). That day, my father\
  \ became one of twenty-two veterans (2009) to die by suicide, every 65 minutes.\
  \ That day, my seventeen-year-old heart stopped beating, too. It is not the statistics\
  \ that make suicide real, it is when you love one of the numbers.\n\nBecause of\
  \ him, I am brave enough to start a conversation that matters, one that may have\
  \ saved his life. I believe you will find the letter sent to my mother and the postcard\
  \ sent to me to be different, but very interesting.\n\n\u202Ahttps://issuu.com/valleymagazine/docs/valley2015springspreads\u202C\
  \n(Pages 18-21)\n\nI was apprehensive welcoming 2019 as this May will mark 10 years\
  \ since his passing. In those years, I graduated from Penn State with a BS in Human\
  \ Development and Family Studies (2015) and continued my education to obtain a MA\
  \ in Mental Health Counseling from Brooklyn College (2017). I have been published\
  \ and/or viral, became a Certified Crisis Counselor, Level 2, for Crisis Text Line\
  \ (2016), achieved Certification in War Trauma (C.W.T., 2017) through the American\
  \ Academy of Experts in Traumatic Stress in collaboration with the National Center\
  \ for Crisis Management, in addition to other life successes. This year, I will\
  \ honor his end by celebrating a new beginning for myself, as a fully-licensed NYS\
  \ Mental Health Practitioner specializing in Psychological Trauma and Crisis Intervention.\
  \ I have attached my resume for your review of my work in both military and civilian\
  \ communities.\n\nI am always searching for new opportunities or partnerships to\
  \ raise awareness of veteran suicide, lack of proper health and mental health care,\
  \ and increasing drug and substance use rates among veterans. As an adolescent,\
  \ I felt as if the universe was conspiring against me. As an adult, I choose to\
  \ believe I was used as a vessel. Military personnel who survive war should not\
  \ lose their battle at home.\_I have found that sharing our story keeps his name\
  \ alive and in turn, I am afforded the opportunity to rewrite our ending.\n\nThank\
  \ you so much for your time and consideration. Please feel free to contact for clarification\
  \ or more information. I hope to hear from you soon.\n\nSincerely,\nGabrielle M.\
  \ Herman, M.A., MHC-LP, C.W.T.\nCertified in War Trauma\nAmerican Academy of Experts\
  \ in Traumatic Stress\nin collaboration with the National Center for Crisis Management\n\
