Text: "Bright lights. Tall buildings. Smog. Those are the first things I noticed as\
  \ I landed in South Korea. Moving across the world by myself to teach English was\
  \ definitely not something I had planned on doing in my lifetime. Sure it was a\
  \ dream of mine, but a pipe dream at best. However, here I was, a recent college\
  \ graduate embarking on a journey in a foreign land I knew absolutely nothing about,\
  \ for who knew how long. Little did I know that two and a half years later, Seoul,\
  \ the little town of 25 million people, would be called home. Moving to Korea was\
  \ exciting, eye opening, and not as scary as one might think. Most days living in\
  \ Korea were pretty normal. I woke up, got ready and went to work, then got dinner\
  \ and went home. The weekends were where life was challenged. Nearly every weekend\
  \ I was out exploring the city, old and new parts. Navigating around the city was\
  \ fairly easy. The metro system is one of the best in the world. Taking a cab around\
  \ was almost as easy, except for the language barrier. Many times I would say the\
  \ name of my desired location perfectly, and yet the drivers still wouldn\u2019\
  t understand. This was frustrating at times but overall it made me realize that\
  \ people can speak the same language and still have a hard time communicating. Communication\
  \ is so important and often times we take it for granted when it comes easily. I\
  \ was fortunate enough to meet several people with whom communication was natural\
  \ and uncomplicated. One of my close friends, a native Korean, taught me a lot about\
  \ Korea and its culture. Something that was very apparent to me was respect, especially\
  \ for elders. Anywhere you went, if there were elderly citizens, they had the right\
  \ of way, specifically the women. Older women in Korea can be somewhat rude, pushing\
  \ you in the subway to get through to a seat, staring at you because you don\u2019\
  t look like them, and snidely talking about you right in front of your face. This\
  \ didn\u2019t happen all the time but when it did, no one seemed to care because\
  \ these women have to be respected no matter what, even if they are in the wrong.\
  \ Another thing I learned about Korea is how big drinking and sharing is. Almost\
  \ every night I saw people, particularly middle aged men, out drinking. While choosing\
  \ to drink or not is a personal decision, in Korea it shows how strong your bond\
  \ with another is. They drink socially and with coworkers, friends, and family.\
  \ Rarely should one refuse a drink by someone they respect if they are offered it.\
  \ This was completely strange to me because I think drinking and nightlife are more\
  \ a friend event, rather than with coworkers. In Korea, the two are seen as the\
  \ same. Many people are close with their coworkers, and those who aren\u2019t might\
  \ go out with them out of respect. Again, respect was everything there. While the\
  \ drinking culture was huge there, Korea was extremely safe. I never feared for\
  \ my life or my possessions being stolen. I could go anywhere and know that I wasn\u2019\
  t in any harm. I will probably miss that most about Korea, being able to walk with\
  \ my friends at 2am and no one bats an eye at us. I have learned many other lessons\
  \ from living in Korea, and my outlook on life has changed a lot. I now value others\
  \ and their time more, I enjoy adventuring out and learning about things I\u2019\
  m unfamiliar with, and I try not to take things that I think should be simple, for\
  \ granted. I\u2019m very grateful for my time in Korea and I hope to be able to\
  \ experience other lands, just as I have here."
