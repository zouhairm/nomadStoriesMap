Text: "\U0001F3B5Take your old life and put a line through it, life is yours if your\
  \ willing to take it\U0001F3B5 - Eastside - Halsey, Khalid and Benny Blanco\U0001F3B5\
  \n\U0001F3B5Still think about you, only all the time\U0001F3B5- Kygo and Valerie\
  \ Broussard\U0001F3B5\n\nAs I sit sad and defeated in my car these songs blare out\
  \ through the radio and all I can think is that you can't live in the past, you\
  \ make decisions and you live your life. Sometimes you just need to move onto the\
  \ next adventure, but man that last one, that last adventure was one of a life time.\
  \ \n\nIt all started with mouse, it always does, something weird and wacky comes\
  \ out of no where and suddenly you find yourself working on a Disney Cruise Ship\
  \ in the middle of the Caribbean ocean. What an experience. I saw so many new places\
  \ around the world including, Mexico, Jamaica, Grand Cayman, Bahamas, Aruba, St\
  \ Thomas, Tortola, St Maarten, Porto Rico and more! To me however, travelling is\
  \ so much more than just seeing new places, I love the experience, I love the memories\
  \ and I love all the people you meet along the way. Working on board the cruise\
  \ ship I met people that to call a friend is an understatement, living in that situation\
  \ and experiencing everything together for such long periods of time, those people\
  \ that I now may never see again, will forever be like family. \n\nEach day was\
  \ a totally new experience doing the exact same thing. We'd wake up tired, go to\
  \ work tired, entertain hundred of kids for 10 hours, scoff down some mass made\
  \ gluggy pasta and potatoes, shower, still tired, nap a little and then perk up\
  \ for a fun filled few hours of social drinking with your best mates before the\
  \ music turns off at two, and everyone slowly wondered back to the Tetris cube bunk\
  \ bedded room we shared to get some more sleep in time to do it all again the next\
  \ day. It was hard, really hard most days, but it was also so fun. The kids were\
  \ hilarious, the games we played were epic, the injuries were endless and the parents\
  \ were difficult. We all loved our job, some more than others, but everyone managed\
  \ to get up each day and see the sunrise, and go to sleep each night having seen\
  \ the sunset. \n\nThe memories made in countries all around the world, with people\
  \ from all around the world are unforgettable. One of my best moments was at the\
  \ Christmas after party. I found myself in a room with a girl from Scotland, a guy\
  \ from Italy, another guy form Chile, and a third guy from Argentina. With me being\
  \ Australian we had five people, from five different countries, all with different\
  \ first languages, but with English in common, still able to talk about the stupidness\
  \ of management and the people that don't pull their weight. That moment taught\
  \ me that were all from anywhere, but we truly are all the same. \nI loved that\
  \ job now that I'm home, I miss every trip I've been on now I'm home, but we all\
  \ get tired and need your bed after a while. Was leaving a mistake? I don't know.\
  \ But we make choices and theres no point thinking \"What if\" in life, because\
  \ you'll end up missing the next thing. And I'm ready for another mind blowing memory."
