Text: "The simplest of questions, and it had left me speechless. The answer, I knew:\
  \ yes, or no. I also knew, of course, that the answer was one I didn\u2019t even\
  \ have to speak, that I could get by, likely, with either a head shake or a nod.\
  \ Yes or no all the same, but without the words. And, yet. I was stuck, unable to\
  \ answer, and feeling like a fool because of it.\n\nBefore me, Suddha stood expectantly.\
  \ Her wide brown eyes blinked patiently, and she appeared unaware of Prince, the\
  \ translator, between us. I wore a long white dress that covered my shoulders and\
  \ ran past my toes, into the red-gray dirt of Suddha\u2019s yard. When I didn\u2019\
  t answer immediately, Prince balked. He seemed to do some quick work in his head,\
  \ asking himself if he had gotten the translation right. He repeated the question:\
  \ Did I use Vodafone too?\n\nWe were in India to learn about mobile banking, an\
  \ increasingly popular phenomenon that allows users to spend, send, save, and receive\
  \ money through their phones. A cellular bank, if you will. To some, this may sound\
  \ simple, like something that already exists. But in the rural stretches of, say,\
  \ Tamil Nadu, India\u2019s southernmost state, there is no Venmo, no Apple Pay.\
  \ Even physical banks are few and far between, a fact that creates issues of accessibility\
  \ and financial autonomy for many citizens, particularly women. Mobile banking,\
  \ though, changes that.\n\nTo explore the extent of those changes,  I \u2013 along\
  \ with a team of two other undergraduate researchers \u2013 paired with Vodafone,\
  \ a phone company and India\u2019s premier supplier of mobile banking. Each day,\
  \ we took a white van to a new Indian village, passing by colorful temples and coconut\
  \ covered fields to quiet towns with lengthy names. Vodafone had granted us access\
  \ to their users, setting up focus groups in which we asked how mobile banking had\
  \ changed these respondent\u2019s lives, if at all. \n\nAfter this particular focus\
  \ group, a hoard of women had circled our team excitedly, jabbering in the rolling\
  \ consonants of Tamil, speaking to Prince and pointing at us. \u201CThey want to\
  \ ask you some questions now,\u201D Prince explained. Our team exchanged glances\
  \ and nodded, curious what those questions could be. Suddha, whom I remembered as\
  \ being this group\u2019s leader, stood at the front. Did we use Vodafone too?\n\
  \nCue me, feeling caught. The answer was no. Vodafone wasn\u2019t, to my knowledge,\
  \ even available in The States. But if I said no, the next question, surely, would\
  \ be why I was so interested in the workings of a phone and banking company that\
  \ I didn\u2019t use. And how to convey that? How to convey curiosity, and rely on\
  \ another person \u2013 an imperfect translator \u2013 to get it right?\n\nSuddenly,\
  \ I felt Prince\u2019s pain; the impossible position he was in each day. And, at\
  \ the same time, I began to understand the quiet we had so often received from our\
  \ respondents. Began to understand one\u2019s hesitancy to allow their words to\
  \ be mixed by a stranger, minced into a language completely foreign to their own.\n\
  \nAshwanth, the youngest of our trio and the only one able to understand Tamil,\
  \ replied simply: no, we didn\u2019t. The women murmured, wonderingly, to each other.\
  \ Some younger girls giggled. Suddha bobbed her head side-to-side and asked another\
  \ question: Ok. Then why we were here? What did we study?\n\nI looked at Suddha.\
  \ Her eyes met mine and I was struck by all the words we would never get to speak\
  \ to each other. By all the words I had but was unable to transfer to her. And,\
  \ within her, the same. So many words neither of us would ever know.\n\nI turned\
  \ from Suddha to Prince, who was tapping his pointer finger against his upper pant\
  \ pocket. \u201CLiterature,\u201D I said, wondering if there was any irony in that\
  \ fact. Prince repeated the word in different sounds. Hearing him, Suddha smiled,\
  \ caught my eye. She spoke, to him, words I couldn\u2019t separate or decipher.\
  \ Prince nodded in the typical Tamil way: a bobbing motion that I had originally\
  \ interpreted as a head shake. \u201CAh,\u201D he said, smiling. \u201CShe is liking\
  \ to read also.\u201D"
