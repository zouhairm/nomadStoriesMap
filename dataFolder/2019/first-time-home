Text: "As I looked through the rusty-tainted windows of Hotel Bilal in the suburbs\
  \ of  Karachi, I immediately felt at home in the land of my ancestors. It was midnight,\
  \ 14 August. Pakistan has turned 71 and the nation was brimming with hope for change\
  \ as Imran Khan was due to take helm in three days time. Streets were filled with\
  \ euphoric cheers and chatter lightly tapping my eardrums. Locals roamed between\
  \ short cottage-like concrete houses which are intercepted by lush tropical plantations\
  \ underneath overhead wires. It was exactly how my grandmother described 1960s Singapore.\
  \ The sky was a spread of orange hue as fireworks exploded in mid-air, along with\
  \ gunshots to mark the day. The illuminating fireworks infiltrated the city with\
  \ endless hope that cannot be seen by the eye but, felt deeply in the hearts. I\
  \ knew my experience at that moment in Hotel Bilal, can never be recreated.  It\
  \ was what to me, made travelling fulfilling. Moments which I know I will experience\
  \ just once in my lifetime. Moments that when they're over, cannot be replicated\
  \ in the next hour, the next years, or even the next life. \n\nI was born in Singapore\
  \ and my great-grandparents were migrants from Pakistan (then \"British Raj\").\
  \ Growing up a Pakistani-Muslim in Chinese-dominated Singapore, I picked up the\
  \ Malay language and not Urdu due to the former being Singapore's native language.\
  \ Being in Karachi for the first time was a lifelong dream. Only knowing the Pakistan\
  \ through the media, my image of my ancestral land is that of chaos, terrorism,\
  \ bloodshed, corruption, and the list just goes on. A nation in the slumps, devoid\
  \ of hope for peace. Is this what Pakistan is? It was not in line with the values\
  \ passed to my grandparents, my parents and me. Our values are that of selflessness\
  \ and kindness and our way is of love and peace. As a Media Analyst by profession,\
  \ monitoring the media daily, I recognise the nation faces serious challenges, but\
  \ I refuse for the media to craft my image of my original motherland.\n\nSo I came\
  \ here.\n\nI was humbled observing and experiencing daily life with the locals.\
  \ Smiles in poverty-stricken Karachi were infectious and more pervasive than in\
  \ wealthy Singapore. Pathways were sandy and men in sarongs carrying sacks and goats\
  \ were a common sight along with hungry children begging for food. The never-ending\
  \ honks of tuk-tuks infuses with the brimming smell of street foods in the air.\
  \ From the sweet saffron-scented Nihari which will set off warm saliva - to the\
  \ charcoal-baked fresh Naan bread. Naans are cooked in microwaves in Singapore but\
  \ here they\u2019re fresh and tears like paper releasing moist steam. Strikingly,\
  \ the people are unanimously friendly, helpful, loving, a stark contrast to the\
  \ Pakistan I knew from the media. Many areas were seemingly poor but peaceful. Life\
  \ was simple. Eating was happiness and not rushed in between meetings in Singapore\u2019\
  s CBD. Communicating with loved ones was an addictive joy and time with family were\
  \ not intercepted by smartphones.\n\nExperiencing life in Karachi was a reminder\
  \ of the poverty I could have easily be trapped in had my great grandparents not\
  \ taken the courageous step to leave  for Singapore in the 1930s. Without their\
  \ courage, I could easily be a kid begging money for food or a labourer pulling\
  \ carts under the scorching sun. I gained massive respect for the locals for their\
  \ valour against hardship which I cannot imagine coping through. They make time\
  \ to be kind and loving to one another whilst I habitually use time as a convenient\
  \ excuse back in fast-paced Singapore. The images I saw were not what the media\
  \ felt worth capturing.\n\nOn my last day in Hotel Bilal, I watched Imran Khan\u2019\
  s inauguration speech on a paper-width antennae television with locals in a crowded\
  \ lobby. My shoulders against the others and chatters in Urdu were beyond my comprehension\
  \ but I could sense the tones of hopefulness. Along with them, I hoped that one\
  \ day the peace I witnessed here will prevail to all parts of Pakistan. I hope that\
  \ the country\u2019s problems will ease and its stories of courage be shared with\
  \ the world.\n\nI hope.\n\nPakistan, Zindabad."
