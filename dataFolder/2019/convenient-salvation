Text: "Our fearless driver raced through traffic, incessantly honking his horn. I\
  \ was in the front row, clutching the dash and trying not to smush my seatmate as\
  \ we barreled around the turns. My husband Jerry and I were stuffed into a shuttle\
  \ van along with 12 other tourists headed to Koh Lanta Island. We had arranged for\
  \ a romantic getaway at a seaside resort there for a mere $35US a night. After the\
  \ spartan amenities we had been enduring on our backpacker\u2019s budget, we were\
  \ eager to trade up for some affordable luxury.\n\nThe offerings at the Blue Andaman\
  \ resort did not disappoint: our air-conditioned poolside cabana was large and private,\
  \ the beds were decorated with flowers and fancy-folded towels, and the Andaman\
  \ sea was just a few steps away. At night the restaurants and bars along the beach\
  \ came alive with music, colored lights and barbecue smoke. \n\nHaving just arrived\
  \ in paradise party central, it was time to celebrate! We toasted with shots of\
  \ local rum and headed to the Rasta-themed beach bar across the courtyard.\n\nSidling\
  \ up under the rattan awning, we kicked off our flip-flops and ordered a round of\
  \ Chang beers. \n\n\u201CChok dee!\u201D The staff cheered with us and queued up\
  \ the Bob Marley. With our toes in the sand, cold beers in hand and the salty ocean\
  \ breeze at our backs, everything was perfect.\n\nAfter a few minutes, though, I\
  \ wasn\u2019t feeling well. I hadn\u2019t had too much to drink, this was something\
  \ else. Something wasn\u2019t right. Jerry had struck a game of pool with a fellow\
  \ traveler, but I declined joining. I left my beer unfinished and went to lie down\
  \ in the room.\n\nWhen Jerry returned, I was pacing and fretting. He sat down on\
  \ the bed, asking what was wrong, baffled as to why my mood had turned sour.\n\n\
  I fell into his lap, sobbing and babbling incoherently.\n\n\u201CIt\u2019s ok, sweetie.\
  \ I\u2019m here, I\u2019ll take care of you,\u201D he petted me.\n\nMoments later\
  \ I was puking my guts out.\n\nJerry seemed fine and fell asleep. But then a few\
  \ hours later, he got up to pee and vomited instead. \n\n\u201CWell,\u201D he said,\
  \ emerging from the bathroom pale and shaken, \u201CIt\u2019s unanimous.\u201D\n\
  \nI had never had food poisoning before. Clutching my cramping belly, I cursed every\
  \ single thing we ingested that day.  Was the it the water they served with our\
  \ curry at the Krabi market? Was the fried chicken undercooked as I suspected? Was\
  \ our pineapple cut with unclean hands?\n\nHours passed with no relief. Then, after\
  \ flushing my guts for the umpteenth time, I took an icy shower and felt revived.\
  \ Jerry was still helpless and the last of our drinkable water was dwindling. We\
  \ were going to need help from the outside world.\n\nI threw a sarong over my shoulders,\
  \ tucked a pocketknife into my bra, grabbed a handful of baht and left him to venture\
  \ out. It was 2 a.m. The reggae bar was empty. My heart sank upon discovering the\
  \ front office dark. No one stirring anywhere, not even a single bro drinking by\
  \ the pool. \n\nI pressed on, accompanied by the stars and the chirping of moo frogs.\
  \ Under better circumstances it would have been a lovely evening stroll.\n\nComing\
  \ upon some locals watching soccer on their front stoop, I approached with caution.\
  \ \n\n\u201CHelp?  My husband is very sick.\u201D\n\nPuzzled looks. \n\n\u201CWe\
  \ need water,\u201D I pleaded.\n\n\u201CWater?\u201D They pointed towards the main\
  \ road. \u201C7-11.\u201D\n\nOf course! Open 24 hours!\n\nI bowed with gratitude\
  \ and limped away down the road, following the fluorescent glow to our salvation.\n\
  \nIn the past, 7-11 had saved us many times on the road in Thailand with quick,\
  \ cheap, and safe food and drink options. But on this harrowing occasion, the beloved\
  \ convenience store truly saved our lives. \n\nWhen I returned victorious, I found\
  \ Jerry waiting for me on the veranda, looking worried and about to fall over. I\
  \ sat him down and reassured him, offering him a sip of bottled water and a saltine.\
  \ We were going to be ok. After a long and painful night, the sky began to turn\
  \ from black to pink and dawn was finally breaking."
