Text: "The monk asked me to take his picture, handing me his smartphone. There were\
  \ two of them, with shaved heads, and thick, elegantly draped maroon and gold robes.\
  \ What I presumed to be Buddhists. We were standing in front of a giant redwood\
  \ tree that is almost older than the Buddha, and older than Jesus. Two thousand\
  \ and four hundred years old, to be precise, and I was trying to drive through this\
  \ same tree. \n\nJust off highway 101 near Leggett, California, a sign which read\
  \ \u201CDrive Through Tree\u201D led us a mile off course and into a tourist trap.\
  \ I don\u2019t know how this tradition of driving through trees was started, but\
  \ ever since I knew you could drive your car through a giant redwood, I\u2019ve\
  \ wanted to do it. So I paid the five dollar entrance fee and waited in line with\
  \ the other cars like it was a busy day at a fast food drive-thru.\n\nUs Americans\
  \ sure do love to drive through places. Even living things, apparently. And we\u2019\
  re even better at waiting in long lines. We watched a Toyota Sequoia reverse out\
  \ of line because it was too big to fit through the tree. I wondered if the irony\
  \ was lost on them. We watched two men on their motorcycles roll their bikes through,\
  \ and finally it was our turn. \n\nAs I stood in the opening of the tree, touching\
  \ its sappy ceiling while my grandmother took a picture, I noticed the two monks\
  \ walking up the road past the cars. They skipped everyone in line and came right\
  \ up to the tree, surprising us with where they came may have come from. There were\
  \ people and cars around, but it still felt that we were in the middle of nowhere.\
  \ And yet here were the monks, asking me to take their picture. Maybe 21st century\
  \ monks have Instagram accounts for such occasions.\n\nA third monk appeared and\
  \ started aiming his ipad up at the giant tree. At 315 feet, it was too tall to\
  \ see the top. After these few moments passed, one of them turned to me and told\
  \ me that I could now go through the tree. I wondered what I\u2019d have thought\
  \ or said had they not been monks. So we drove through the tree, just barely squeezing\
  \ through\u2014the whole time my grandmother muttering with worry that I might scrape\
  \ my car. I stopped halfway out the other side and took a picture of my car inside\
  \ the tree.\n\nThe average Toyota can last a good decade or three, if taken care\
  \ of. Trees on the other hand, are some of the longest living organisms around.\
  \ Coastal Redwoods can live about 1800 years or more, and are some of the tallest\
  \ trees on earth. \n\nThese trees have lived for thousands of years, mostly untouched\
  \ except for the fog and rain. Redwoods are habitats for many different creatures,\
  \ each level of their soaring height part of an ecosystem of various birds and insects.\
  \ Like nature\u2019s skyscrapers, with humans loitering at the bottom. Thousands\
  \ of peaceful forest years gone by and here we are in the point in history where\
  \ humans drive through trees and monks have iphones. \n\nWe are the obnoxious, gentrifying\
  \ newbies coming to set up shop and find a way to make money from something beautiful.\
  \  But perhaps the modern ritual of pointing our cameras and throwing money at something\
  \ is our own form of worship. If a monk will do it, it surely can\u2019t be harmful?\
  \  At least now the redwood logging era is over, though an estimated 70 percent\
  \ of the original trees are gone. We can finally stop to appreciate what\u2019s\
  \ left.  Modern humans are slowly learning to appreciate the natural world, albeit\
  \ in strange ways. \n\nBeing around such ancient trees, it makes me wonder what\
  \ this scene will look like in another thousand years. Will trees reincarnated as\
  \ monks come back to visit? Will the redwoods still be around? Will humans? Who\
  \ will prosper?\n\nI hope it\u2019s the trees. I hope it\u2019s both."
