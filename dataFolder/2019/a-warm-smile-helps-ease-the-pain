Text: "Thick flakes of snow are falling fast, and I can barely see the trail in front\
  \ of me. My ski instructor has skied ahead, beckoning me to follow him. But I cannot\
  \ make out his form in the distance, let alone the trail he left. Rubbing the outside\
  \ of my ski goggles does little to improve visibility. I feel the panic rise within\
  \ me. With no other alternative, I stab my ski poles into the fresh snow and push\
  \ off into the unknown. Adrenaline spikes. My legs shake. This was the decisive\
  \ moment on the slopes of Japan\u2019s Nozawa Onsen I\u2019d forever regret. \n\n\
  \nThat morning I\u2019d been in two minds as to whether I should ski or have a rest\
  \ day. My 51year-old knees had taken a pounding from a few day\u2019s skiing. And\
  \ Nozawa Onsen, as the name implies is teeming with both public and private onsens.\
  \ These naturally fuelled hot springs provide a traditional Japanese bathing experience\
  \ that sounded a very attractive (and relaxing) alternative. But unable to relinquish\
  \ my mom responsibilities, I had to ensure my two boys (18 and 13 years) would get\
  \ to their ski lesson. Confusion on the first day resulted in my lads missing their\
  \ initial lesson.  My plan today was to drop them at ski school and ask about taking\
  \ a make-up lesson.\n \nNegotiations with the ski school manager to \u2018bend\u2019\
  \ the cancellation rules allowed me a private lesson.  Perfect I thought. I\u2019\
  d ski for two hours and meet my boys back at the ski school.  My ski instructor\
  \ Doug, very non-Japanese (from England) took me to the middle section of the mountain.\
  \ I requested we stick to easy green runs given the poor visibility.  \n\nFollowing\
  \ what I thought was Doug\u2019s trail, I felt my speed build. My brain said slow\
  \ down, but before I could my ski tips plowed into a large powder embankment, stopping\
  \ me immediately. My body, however, continued forward and I face-planted in the\
  \ soft snow. Constrained in their boots my legs twisted awkwardly and I heard a\
  \ sickening \u2018snap\u2019 sound. \n\nDoug skied over and with his help, I removed\
  \ my skis and attempted to stand. Searing pain shot through my left leg. Ski rescue\
  \ was summonsed. My head swirled with jumbled thoughts. A single mum on holidays\
  \ with two kids, I was meant to be the responsible adult. This was only day five\
  \ of our 12-day Japan holiday. What was going to happen?\n\n\nAt Nozawa\u2019s small\
  \ village clinic, I\u2019m greeted by two smiling Japanese nurses who with limited\
  \ English indicated my ski boots had to be removed before entering. Japanese etiquette\
  \ requires no shoes inside. I can\u2019t publish the words accompanying that painful\
  \ left boot removal.\n\nThe medical staff seemingly prolonged my nightmare by not\
  \ providing any pain relief. And my basic Japanese meant I couldn't ask why. That\u2019\
  s when I met Dr. Katagiri. He was the first person (apart from Doug) since hurting\
  \ myself who spoke a little English. An understanding smile and kind eyes behind\
  \ silver-framed glasses created a sense of calm within my shocked body. Only momentarily\
  \ though as he reached out to straighten my leg for an x-ray, almost causing me\
  \ to pass out from the pain.\n\nOur Japan holiday was cut short when Dr. Katagiri\
  \ explained the results of the x-ray. \u201CYou have fracture to tibia, it\u2019\
  s bad and you must go home to have fixed.\u201D\n\nTwo days later, I returned to\
  \ the clinic to obtain medical clearance to fly home.  Not writhing in pain allows\
  \ one to take in their surroundings and have a decent conversation.  Dr. Katagiri\
  \ opened his phone and pointed to a collection of historical photos of the clinic,\
  \ which opened in 1767. \u201CI\u2019m the twelfth generation of Doctors in my family\
  \ to work at the Nozawa Clinic,\u201D he tells me proudly.  We are now Facebook\
  \ friends, forever connected by the power of social media.\n\nFour days after my\
  \ incident, I flew home to Australia for reconstructive surgery. During my journey\
  \ from Nozawa Onsen to Tokyo with crutches and a huge plaster cast on my left leg,\
  \ I received overwhelming compassion and a unique insight into the Japanese people.\
  \ A humbling experience that has forever changed me."
