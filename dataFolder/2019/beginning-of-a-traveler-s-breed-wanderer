Text: "Trip to Unknown Place,in between Unknown People,Unknown surrounding :\n\nI\
  \ can say  I experienced Travelling solo at unknown places of God's Own Country\
  \  KERALA . This time I planned to go on a full month Kerala solo trip ,wanna do\
  \ things which has never happened earlier ,wanted to feel the feeling of going away\
  \ from family and known people, wanted to be in middle of unknown people,unknown\
  \ place where no one knows me.  First time went away from home for a long duration\
  \ ,First time boarded visited airport/boarded flight, all together different feeling\
  \ at the time of Leaving home\nFirst time lived with unknown people in shared rooms,\
  \ experienced Kerala Traditional Martial arts Kalaripayattu , Kerala food ,their\
  \ rituals/local life ,prayers in temple and interacted with locals ,explored Kerala\
  \ and nearby places.\nIt was like all butterflies suddenly started flying in my\
  \ stomach at the time of Take off ,amazing view at the time of landing at Kerala.\
  \  I need to reach at Parasalla ,all Greenery around Roadside ,I can feel the pollution\
  \ free air, I hired a Autorikshaw and driver was very good English speaking,on the\
  \ way he was showing me and telling the names of places.\nI reached at the place\
  \ Dharmikam Ashram, its a Ashram where Ayurvedic Treatments/Marma massages given\
  \ to patients and also Kalaripayatu Training to students . I went their to spend\
  \ some time in Peace and learn little bit of Kalari.\n\nAshram is spread over acres\
  \ of space ,filled with Green long coconut trees ,lake,cafeteria,treatment rooms,lots\
  \ of Dogs/cats,Swami House,Reception,Temple inside,Practice area ,meditation room\
  \ etc  .Students who come for Training are assigned with some Duties and also taught\
  \ them discipline,it is like shown in Baaghi movie\nI opted for Dormitary stay as\
  \ It has 5 beds common Bathroom is outside,it also has medicine room which is used\
  \ for Ayurvedic treatment ,medicine preparation room where they use to prepare Ayurvedic\
  \ oils from natural leafs etc. \nAs I also need to do some work at Ashram, I opted\
  \ for the easy one i.e sitting at Reception and doing my office work.\nSwami ji\
  \ is a good person and funny,lot of exp in Treatment and Kalari. \nKalari Training\
  \ has a dress like Dhoti and Kaccha(Waist Belt) ,nothing to wear on top. Kalari\
  \ is the place made of Mud/mitti floor surrounded by walls and it is lower then\
  \ the floor surface. All swords bhala etc kept on walls around. First day I was\
  \ seeing that the Trainer teaching to do self spin by holding the students from\
  \ their waist and other some Exercises . \nThat night I was actually thinking where\
  \ I came and waana go in morning to explore Kerala and go home after a week as it\
  \ was totally different,sleeping in shared room ,food etc. Next morning I woke up,spoken\
  \ to more students there about Training then i asked internally to stay and judge\
  \ yourself for 1 month  .\nAdter 4 Days , my training also started as it is actually\
  \ difficult at this age to grasp physical strecting etc Their are different body\
  \ posures,pranam etc which we learned and made new friends. On every weekend we\
  \ use to go out and Explore nearby places like Kovalam,Poovar,Varkala etc.\nI spended\
  \ 1 month their and loosed good amount of weight too, After leaving Ashram, I expereinced\
  \ Railway Trip Kanyakumari to Rameshwaram,over oldest Railway Pamban Bridge,scary\
  \ feeling while seeing Ocean from train door. Visited Dhanushkodi where Two Ocean\
  \ Meet and major historic event took place Ram Setu at the time of Ramayana. From\
  \ Rameshwaram I stayed for 1 Night at Varkala Cliff beach ,awsm Cafe's,beach side\
  \ view , and also visited Wayanad with one of my Old Kerala friend ,Wayanad is very\
  \ nice hilly aplace,Tea plantation etc.\n\nAtlast I am back Home after a month with\
  \ lots of memories ,learned,experienced too much,seen a different way of life,After\
  \ this trip traveled full year every month and Travelling actually teaches .\nHappy\
