Text: "The sun kisses my face, a light breeze is rushing through my hair and the smell\
  \ of this beautiful summer morning is tingling in my nose. Perth main station, March\
  \ 5th 2019, 8 am. I am back in Australia, the country I fell in love with ten years\
  \ ago. Although I\u2018m not even filling half a square metre of that huge landmass\
  \ of 7.7 million square kilometres I feel cosy. Besides stunning scenery and amazing\
  \ wildlife I kept Australia in my heart as the place of lovely people from a great\
  \ variety of nationalities. This doesn\u2019t seem to have changed in ten years\
  \ when I discover the art installation saying \u201Cwe are one, but we are many\u201C\
  .\n\nI\u2019m taking a bus to Mandurah to stay at a friend\u2018s place. The city\
  \ stretches along the Indian Ocean with its 28 kilometres of canal waterways. Walking\
  \ along the wooden pier at the Esplanade which surrounds one of the huge river basins\
  \ I\u2018m curious to explore this city. The caf\xE9s are full of people and tourists\
  \ are on their way to a boat cruise. When I am about to leave for the harbour, I\
  \ look back to the water and suddenly a fin appears. A dolphin! Totally excited,\
  \ I decide to run to the jetty that reaches into the water. I take my shoes off\
  \ to sit down on the wooden surface at the far end of the jetty. I dip my feet into\
  \ the calm water with no clue if this stranger will ever come close. There are many\
  \ boats around and the fin is now really far away from me and the jetty. I decide\
  \ not to follow it by walking around the river basin because I\u2019m sure it is\
  \ so much faster than I could ever be. I keep my feet in the water which is refreshing\
  \ on that hot summer day. The intense blue of the sky I have only ever seen in Australia.\
  \ I hope so much for this dolphin to come to the jetty that I start squeaking, trying\
  \ to sound familiar to it. Not sure if it\u2018s my sounds, my feet doing circles\
  \ in the water or any delicious fish close to me, but finally its fin points in\
  \ my direction. Then one minute nothing to see from it. The next time it shows up\
  \ it is sliding slowly in and out of the water only 20 metres in front of me. I\
  \ continue squeaking louder and louder. And suddenly this beautiful sea mammel is\
  \ directly in front of me diving in circles around the jetty. At the beginning it\
  \ passes quite fast. After a while it seems to trust me swimming along slowly next\
  \ to my feet, watching me cautiously and curiously at the same time. The grey-blue\
  \ colored tone of its skin reflects the sun when the water rushes down. I fall straight\
  \ in love with this beautiful creature and am about to jump into the water.\n\n\
  This interaction goes on for an hour. When I\u2018m thinking this can\u2018t get\
  \ any better, the dolphin shows up forcefully breathing out directly in front of\
  \ me. The fresh water fountain sprinkles small perls onto my skin and clothes. This\
  \ is the best shower I have had in my entire life. Then my dolphin friend dives\
  \ away and I am so thankful for this one hour it has spent with me.\n\nI conciously\
  \ pause for a moment to enjoy my happiness. This once in a lifetime experience reminds\
  \ me of our responsibility towards nature. These creatures can do nothing but trust\
  \ in us humans to save their environment. Finally I know my purpose for life to\
  \ make sure what I do comes from heart. I want to be a travel writer to reveal the\
  \ treasures of nature and point out ways to save our planet from climate change\
  \ and pollution. I\u2019m convinced that raising awareness amongst travellers, nature\
  \ lovers and influencers around the world can have a big impact. In my opinion,\
  \ this is one of the most important jobs of my generation. Because what is there\
  \ to explore, photograph and write about if we watch our planet dying?"
