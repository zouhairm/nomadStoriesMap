Text: "\u201CThere\u2019s a village just like this one, over those hills.\u201D Mario\
  \ points at somewhere in the middle of the forest-ish nowhere surrounding us. \u201C\
  The narcos came there two years ago and started cultivating. I don\u2019t like the\
  \ narcos, but at least they have a proper bridge and a paved road, now.\u201D\n\
  I don\u2019t answer. Because, well, what could I say?\nSanta Teresa is lost somewhere\
  \ on the borders of la sierra. There\u2019s no water piping, no school \u2013 kids\
  \ have their lessons diffused on TV \u2013 and just one landline in the village\
  \ shop, that is also the village bar and classroom. There is only one road leading\
  \ here and it\u2019s unpaved, but that\u2019s not the problem: the bridge situated\
  \ little before entering the village is condemned. They still use it \u2013 what\
  \ else could they do? \u2013 but it\u2019s not safe. They\u2019ve asked the government\
  \ to fix it several times, but nobody ever bothered answering their requests.\n\
  The thing is, there\u2019s nothing special about this place. No profitable cultivations,\
  \ mines, tourist attractions, no renown natural beauties. Mario and the kids bring\
  \ us inside the forest to visit a lake and a cliff where part of a Hollywood movie\
  \ was filmed: this corner of seemingly untouched, luxurious nature climbs up through\
  \ ancient trees and undisclosed paths; we also go canoeing \u2013 \u201Cwatch the\
  \ crocodiles\u201D, says Mario dryly \u2013 and it feels like being in an Indiana\
  \ Jones film, say just as they are about to find the lost valley of guess-the-name.\
  \ But this is no famous spot, and no one ever comes here. The government has no\
  \ interest whatsoever in taking care of Santa Teresa. Plus, the villagers are Zapotecs,\
  \ one of Mexico\u2019s people, and it shows blatantly in their aspect.\nBeing Zapotec\
  \ is apparently not a good thing. Once, Mario and two of the kids bring us to the\
  \ city of Puebla. Together we enter the local cathedral. I\u2019m with Charlotte,\
  \ my Franco Mexican white-skinned friend, and we are walking a couple metres ahead\
  \ of the guys. A guard comes and tells them to stop following \u201Cthe two ladies\u201D\
  . We have to explain they\u2019re not bothering us, they\u2019re with us. \nWe\u2019\
  ve come to Mexico to do research about contemporary Mexican circus. To me, this\
  \ is also my first great journey, of the kind you expect will unveil some universal\
  \ truth. I\u2019ve imagined visiting cities, historical sites, circuses of course,\
  \ but I didn\u2019t envisage something like Santa Teresa. If we\u2019re here it\u2019\
  s because of the maromeros, a group of teens who practise an ancient type of acrobatics\
  \ dating earlier than la conquista. They literally dance on the rope. \nThe first\
  \ time I see it happen, the impression the village gives of being out of the world,\
  \ unsynchronised with reality, amplifies. The maromeros are around 16 years old,\
  \ they practise barefoot on a rope two metres over the ground. They wear traditional\
  \ costumes on stage, but now they\u2019re just training in their shorts and t-shirts.\
  \ There\u2019s no music playing, they sing for each other and clap hands. As I\u2019\
  m here, surrounded by trees, in this village where they have nothing and yet they\u2019\
  re so proud of sharing it with us, and I look at these kids almost flying over the\
  \ rope, feet moving fast and gently like they didn\u2019t even touch the rope, I\
  \ have the precise feeling of being confronted to actual, absolute beauty. Great?\
  \ Well, not really.\n\u201CWhen they hit legal age they usually stop practising\
  \ and leave. They try their chance crossing the border, they go to work for some\
  \ shitty exploiter in the U.S.,\u201D tells us Mario. He\u2019s the only adult male\
  \ I meet around the village. There are women of all ages, kids, old men. \u201C\
  Adult men are in the States, trying to make money to send home. Here, where we can\u2019\
  t even get a bridge fixed.\u201D\nWhen the time to leave comes I\u2019ve found my\
  \ truth, but it\u2019s heavy victory. There\u2019s all this beauty around, spread\
  \ everywhere, in every little corner, and we are unable to see it, protect it and\
  \ appreciate its value. \n\u201CCome back soon,\u201D says Mario, and I wish, I\
  \ will. And I hope when the day comes, somewhen will have fixed the bridge. Just\
  \ not the narcos."
