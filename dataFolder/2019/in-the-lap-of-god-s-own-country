Text: The destination was none other than our very "Indian" kerala. You find it very
  charming people much like to the soulful India can gift to an individual. The better
  it gets when one can connect it to the localites. I remember I was in Alleppey and
  I was travelling kerala like anything. Much to my amusement I got to met with this
  man called Hary. This man can be the definition of the word simplicity,wearing golden
  lined dhuti much like the other local people. This man made me realise the the travel
  can be just like nothing other than meeting people in their own culture and become
  the part of it just in a way to mend the gap between the culture differences. I
  made it two days stay in alleppey and this man took me to their soulful village
  just beside, with the scent of backwater in them. The wellness and richness I noticed
  while spending time with them was "Great". I just got mixed with them. They greeted
  me in a way that they know mw for years. I was given their own house to stay and
  watch their culture from very close. Much to my amusement I got to see the very
  kerala with them keeping hand in hand.I travelled by their boat, went fishing lived
  life once like them. I feel great to have experienced this. Kerala was once travelled
  to the fullest and I was the gainer.
