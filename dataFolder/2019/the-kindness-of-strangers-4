Text: "Mount Everest, what comes to mind when you hear its name? Is it excitement\
  \ or trepidation? Is it a sense of awe? Or just general knowledge of a famous geographical\
  \ feature learned many years ago.\n\nWe have just walked across a plateau that looks\
  \ almost other worldly. Covered in white sand it feels as though we are on the moon.\
  \ A pure white horse strides across the field, a little distance from us. It carries\
  \ with it an aura of mystique, as though it had magically materialised in this barren\
  \ but beautiful scene. And yet it looks more at home than I feel. I place one foot\
  \ in front of the other. Looking down I watch my small, laboured steps propel me\
  \ slowly forward. \n\nWe had finally made it to the start of the final trek to Everest\
  \ base camp, after days of walking behind us. This has been our pinnacle and that\
  \ of all our fellow travellers. The final achievement, the imagined destination.\
  \ What will it be like when we set foot there? For those few moments existing at\
  \ the threshold of the highest mountain in the world? \n\nI never imagined I wouldn\u2019\
  t make it. The days of walking had been tiring and the effects of the altitude could\
  \ be felt in my strained breathing, in the headaches that would come and go as we\
  \ acclimatised to greater and greater heights. But I had felt strong and well. To\
  \ not make it to the goal, that was unimaginable. \n\nBut suddenly my head felt\
  \ like it was gripped in a vice. I was in a halo of piercing pain, one that makes\
  \ you want to shrink into a tight ball, untouched by the outside world. Willing\
  \ the pain away I wished I had taken those tablets to help with acclimatisation,\
  \ too late.\n\nFor a moment, I thought maybe I can\u2019t go on despite having come\
  \ so far. Maybe I will never see with my own eyes this sight that has occupied the\
  \ imagination and the pursuit of so many. I don\u2019t remember what happened then.\
  \ Did the pain ease? Probably. Did my will overcome the limitations of my weakened\
  \ body? Perhaps. Whatever the case I kept walking.\n\nI remember delicate blue flowers\
  \ growing between rocks, I don\u2019t know why but I didn\u2019t expect there to\
  \ be flowers. I remember with a caught breath the awesome whoosh of furious sound\
  \ as an avalanche fell on a neighbouring mountain. I remember the sure-footed dogs,\
  \ who knows where they came from, who weaved effortlessly between the awe-struck\
  \ march of human bodies. \n\nBut most unexpected of all was the compassion of my\
  \ Sherpa porter. We could not communicate very much apart from gesture, yet in this\
  \ so much was spoken. I remember the warm kindness that emanated from his gentle\
  \ gaze as he walked silently alongside me, like a guardian protector. A young man\
  \ who had walked this path so many times before. A labourer who was paid a minimal\
  \ income to do such physically demanding work. He had carried my burdensome pack\
  \ all across these mountains whilst I had carried a light day pack with just the\
  \ bare essentials. He didn\u2019t owe me anything more.\n\nI will never be sure\
  \ of the reason for his kindness but I like to think that he respected me, as I\
  \ did him. And not only this but that he also respected these mountains, and knew\
  \ the immense privilege it is to stand amongst them, in awe of their beauty and\
  \ might. Being dwarfed by these majestic mountains, both wondrous and terrifying,\
  \ our human adventures fall into a different perspective. \n\nAnd with one more\
  \ weary step I arrived at Mount Everest base camp. The place was buzzing with excitement,\
  \ with people from all over the world celebrating a shared achievement. There were\
  \ flags of many colours and nations, strangers taking photos for one another, and\
  \ high fives to go around. My porter joined in the celebration, acknowledging our\
  \ joy in reaching this destination, for many of us the first and probably only time\
  \ we would stand on this revered ground. I gave him a high five. And in this small\
  \ gesture I hoped to communicate so much."
