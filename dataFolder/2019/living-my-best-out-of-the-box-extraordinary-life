Text: "Hello every body! Or should I say... sawattdi ka! Its so nice to meet you and\
  \ be able to greet you from Thailand wherever you are.\n\nMy name is Cecy Esparza,\
  \ I'm a mexican girl who just graduated from a tourism business management carreer\
  \ and begun a traveler and culture seaking dream life by coming to work a full year\
  \ in hospitality industry to Thailand.\n\nI honestly love my career in tourism business\
  \ but my true passion lies on the entertainment and cultural industry... everything\
  \ that involves arts, people, hospitality and human connection.\n\nI've been living\
  \ in Thailand for a month so far and I've couldn't be happier. This is my first\
  \ experience traveling alone but as I've already done in a past three week study\
  \ travel to Oregon, USA... I always manage to get out of the box unbelievable experiences\
  \ with people because my purpose is always to learn and connect!\n\nI'll never forget\
  \ that time I just randomly started talking to a fellow mexican guy who was selling\
  \ tamales on a farmers market we visited and an Australian men join the conversation\
  \ while my classmates just layed on the ground talking between themselves.\n\nI\
  \ ended up with a HUGE free tamal and while walking back to the university my now\
  \ new friend from Australia honked his truck at me to say \"Goodbye Cecilia!\" While\
  \ my classmates (and teachers) just stared in amusement.\n\nIn the month I've been\
  \ here in Thailand, I've already had a hand full of experiences...\n\nI met a Thai\
  \ yoga teacher trough a facebook event with whom I sat a whole evening after class\
  \ to talk about our own life experiences, she told me the story of how she managed\
  \ to get a yoga teaching course in India! And that she just started giving classes.\n\
  \nI also been to the most famous temples, malls and markets in Bangkok with work\
  \ friends and people I've met trough my internship agency.\n\nI've also joined a\
  \ traditional dance and music club at Chulalongkorn university just by passing by\
  \ one day (when I used the way trough the camus as a shortcut) and asking if I could\
  \ join!\n\nThey told me I could join for their big face presentation this year!\
  \ I'm so excited! And that I could help them with the singing and the design (painting)\
  \ of the scenario as well! (I'll tell you more about it later if you're interested.)\n\
  \nI love cooking in my kitchen, trying to learn Thai cuisine and tasting Thai street\
  \ food ad much as I can. I'm not afraid of scorpions or ants, I'm actually looking\
  \ forward to try everything and experience even more!\n\nLearning Thai to understand\
  \ and connect better, looking forward to volunteer and more!\n\nI came to Thailand\
  \ to learn about culture and art giving my best to connect with locals everywhere\
  \ I go. I want to travel not just because I want to say or think \"oh, I've been\
  \ there, I've done that\", I want to end up with a huge variety of stories and actual\
  \ friends to talk about.\n\nLearn the core of a culture, immerse myself in their\
  \ everyday life and project that trough the world with my writing. \n\nEven I dont\
  \ know that much about videography and photography yet, I have a special love and\
  \ passion about visual arts in general and I'm on my way to learning and getting\
  \ the best skills to spread the message...\n\nCulture, art, nature, humanity, love,\
  \ friendship and compassion, hand in hand with friends and new every day learning\
  \ in the way!"
