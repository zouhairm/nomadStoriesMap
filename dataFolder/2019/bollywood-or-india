Text: "When I was a child, I used to watch Indian TV serials.  I saw India through\
  \ Bollywood movies. I thought all families would live in homes with their grandparents,\
  \ uncles and aunts. They would all be speaking Hindi and know some English. I imagined\
  \ that the people of India as tall and dark, with big eyes and curly hair. Women\
  \ would be wearing saris that revealed their stomachs and girls would wear Panjabi\
  \ Kurta Baijama. Men in offices would wear suits but at home they would wear a top\
  \ that was long to their knees and instead of pants that had some sort of cloth\
  \ tied at the waist that covered their legs. From the movies I knew that the people\
  \ worshipped different Hindu Idols, would go to the temple to light oil lamps and\
  \ present split coconuts and banana to their Gods. In their weddings, brides would\
  \ wear beautiful colorful Saris with lots of gold Jewels. Men would wear long length\
  \ shirts and pants or Dhotis during the marriage ceremony the married couple would\
  \ go around a fire and take the oath of marriage. \nThese were all what I learned\
  \ about India from the TV serials and Indian movies. It all seemed exotic and interesting\
  \ to me. I dreamt of going there to see everything for myself. But when I grew older\
  \ the Indian serials were not televised anymore and I forget about India and all\
  \ those beautiful girls with the saris who were still dancing in my dreams.  \n\
  Time passed and I got the opportunity to visit India when I was 22. All my dreams\
  \ came back to me. I was excited that I was going to see everything that I\u2019\
  d seen in the serials. \nWhen I got off the airplane, the first thing I noticed\
  \ was the extremely hot weather of Delhi.  For an Afghan who lived in sub Zero temperature\
  \ most of the year, it was like jumping into a boiling oil vessel. It was more than\
  \ 40 Degree C. Delhi is a crowded hot city with many homeless people in the street\
  \ that I never saw them in the movies. Every 200 meters or so one will find a small\
  \ park with many people walking around, reading books and children playing nearby.\
  \ \nAfter few days in Delhi I went to Shillong, Meghalaya Sate in the Northeast\
  \ of India where I stayed longer. That place was a completely different world again.\
  \ I was pleasantly surprised to find that it was mountainous, green and cold place.\
  \ Even in summer I needed to use a sweater. People there were Chinese looking and\
  \ were short. Most of them were Christians. One could see many beautiful churches\
  \ there. Brides wore a white gown and grooms wore black suites during their weddings.\
  \ Mostly they were not living in joint family. Often men and women of marriageable\
  \ age fell in love and get married. At normal times women and men were dressed in\
  \ modern western style. Only few women in the community were wearing saris and also\
  \ few girls were wearing Panjabi Paijamans. Also women were dressed in special clothes\
  \ which were called Jainsam (the traditional Khasi female dress is called the Jainsam\
  \ or Dhara, both of which are rather elaborate with several pieces of cloth, giving\
  \ the body a cylindrical shape.)The language they spoke was Khasi which is tribal\
  \ language in that region. \nIndia was so very different from what I saw on TV and\
  \ Bollywood movies. Each state of India has its own state government; has a state\
  \ language. The culture across the country is very diverse and different. India\
  \ looks like a motley of different cultures, dress code and food habit.  It is one\
  \ of the most diverse countries in the world. Despite of their difference in religions,\
  \ ethnicities and customs, they all live together in peace and harmony. There were\
  \ ancient temples, old mosques and old churches. Descriptions in different tourist\
  \ spots were inscribed in English, Persian and Hindi. But the real beauty of India\
  \ is in its warmth of hospitality. Everyone from other countries should have a chance\
  \ at least once in his/her life time to immerse and experience this rich cultural\
  \ diversity."
