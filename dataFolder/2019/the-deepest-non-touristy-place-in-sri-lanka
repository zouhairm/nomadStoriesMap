Text: "Hundreds of filled sacks snaked inside and out of unstable buildings, full\
  \ of cobwebs. \nThe daylight filtered through the uneven beams with razor sharp\
  \ fainted rays and at times illuminated the vegetables and its swarming owners.\
  \ \nI had abandoned the heat and the sultry humidity for a moment, and I found myself\
  \ in the oppressive gloom of the market. \nOnce inside, I completely forgot about\
  \ the rest of the world.\n\nI really felt the lure of Asia, so I had planned this\
  \ trip for months. \nI realized that I was at a time in my life where I needed to\
  \ search for answers to my concerns about the unhealthy way of living of our modern\
  \ day society. I believe people these days rarely manage to connect with other human\
  \ beings, so I thought Asia in general was an obligatory travel choice in order\
  \ to find some answers, but our trip to Sri Lanka, in particular, happened purely\
  \ by coincidence.\n\nIn order to get to Colombo, the capital city, I used all any\
  \ anti-conventional means possible. I felt like it had to be a journey that permitted\
  \ to be totally in contact with the local culture and to enter the country and its\
  \ inhabitants\u2019 soul. I travelled for long hours and days with local buses.\
  \ I saw cities drenched by tropical storms, I slept in rooms with inevitable holes\
  \ in the ceiling and I rarely managed to clean and wash myself with hot water.\n\
  \nMy local contact was a man named Dinusha, a person who, due to unusual events,\
  \ was probably the primary cause of my presence in that country. My goal was to\
  \ connect with the local inhabitants so I asked him for advice. \"Visit the fruit\
  \ and vegetable market in Colombo, it's an experience that tourists don\u2019t usually\
  \ consider\", he said. I have to admit that he was right.\n\nI decided to go there\
  \ early in the morning, when the rest of the world was still asleep, unlike this\
  \ part of Asia. The area was near to the bus station and it was immersed in a filthy\
  \ and noisy environment, with a perennial unpleasant smell. The industrial buildings\
  \ appeared in all their degradation, with unsafe signs, blackened edges and non-existent\
  \ doors. I saw rooms full of open bags on the floor that were overflowing with an\
  \ immense quantity of fruit and vegetables. I chose an opening and I decided to\
  \ penetrate that unknown place, firmly believing that I could be a part of it.\n\
  \nI was sucked into an almost inconceivable spiral of outstretched hands, smiles\
  \ and photo requests, that absorbed me with no respite. Minutes quickly turned into\
  \ hours, but since I was overwhelmed by the pungent smell of vegetables, I struggled\
  \ to fully embrace the wonderful underground world I happened to find myself in.\
  \ Nevertheless, I felt like I was exactly where I needed to be. I saw eyes, hands,\
  \ legs. Being far from home and totally immersed in my surroundings, I felt as if\
  \ I lost all my certainties. \n\nWith my camera ready, I walked among the vegetable\
  \ bags, minding not to step on them and I noticed that some of the vegetables of\
  \ the bags mingled with those of the neighbor bag in a maze of rooms as far as the\
  \ eye could see. \nUnexpectedly, from the looks of the locals surrounding me, I\
  \ felt an immense gratitude, energy and positivity towards my visit and my persona.\
  \ I was the only foreigner there. \"Where are you from?\u201D, they asked, \"Italy\"\
  , I replied, \"Ah, Italia!!\", It was always the same exclamation in response. \n\
  Suddenly, a merchant with a long knife tied to his waistband (with all the intention\
  \ of extracting it), approached. \"Try one of these\", he said, and with that same\
  \ knife, he cut bright colored pieces of exotic fruit for us to taste.\n\nI felt\
  \ accepted in a new culture as a human being, without any barriers and without any\
  \ fear. \nI no longer felt like a foreigner. \nMost of my questions remained unanswered,\
  \ but I managed to find the connection I was looking for, by letting myself be carried\
  \ away by the strong cultural identity that these people never seem to have forgotten."
