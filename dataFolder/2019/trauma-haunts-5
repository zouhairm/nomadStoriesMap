Text: "The crowd cheered as the bartender crowned their friend with a football helmet,\
  \ spun him in circles until he stumbled, then punched him in the face, tore off\
  \ the head gear, and fed him a shot. \n\nThe bar, called Base Camp, was Lille, France\u2019\
  s attempt to mash Coyote Ugly with the spawn of Hooters and a night club. A furry\
  \ danced through the tiny room; scantily-clad waitresses carried whistles to make\
  \ people move. Shot flights garnished with sparklers, flashing red and blue lights\u2014\
  crowded, loud, and what should been a riot for my friends and I.\n\nYet, as they\
  \ threw their hands in the air, carefree and blending in, my chest grew tight. The\
  \ bar smelled increasingly acidic. Every light blinded me. Blaring music quieted\
  \ and painful memories replaced its tune: \u201CIsn\u2019t this what you wanted?\u201D\
  \n\nWhen I set out that night, I didn\u2019t expect to find myself hyperventilating\
  \ on the dance floor by the end of it. \u201CYou\u2019re over this,\u201D I told\
  \ myself, trying to breath. \u201CLet it go. Have fun.\u201D\n\nI lasted three minutes\
  \ and told my friends I had to leave. \n\nWe headed to the metro through crisp,\
  \ September air. Every sound, even lovely ones, rattled me like a new fear: Compact\
  \ stick shifts whizzing by, people pouring from bars onto the antique, lamp-lit\
  \ streets, my friends\u2019 laughter, my boots tapping on cobblestone sidewalks.\
  \ And I still couldn\u2019t breath.\n\nThe metro was hollow. Its last train departed\
  \ shrilly\u2014without us. My friends headed for home, but in a suffocated state\
  \ I refused to call an Uber. It didn\u2019t matter that Lille isn\u2019t particularly\
  \ safe. \u201CI just need fresh air.\u201D\n\nI propelled towards my bed, holding\
  \ cold keys between my fingers and cringing at each footstep. I gave myself whiplash\
  \ looking over my shoulder every five seconds.\n\nFresh air didn\u2019t help; I\
  \ saw every detail of my assault mirrored in the city. The regularly pretty and\
  \ plush streets smelled foul. Rancid garbage cans overflowed. Bottles shattered\
  \ in an alley. \n\nLille\u2019s elegant facades faded despite the moonlight, and\
  \ I chastised myself, bruised and alienated, for letting trauma steal adventure\
  \ from me. He was winning again. \n\nWhy was it so difficult to just have fun? \u201C\
  Why can\u2019t I just let it go?\u201D \n\nIt took thirty minutes to get home. My\
  \ key wouldn\u2019t unlock the door, as expected, and I collapsed in tears, breathless\
  \ on the stoop. \n\n\n\nThe next day, I dragged out the door with bags under my\
  \ eyes bigger than a French girl\u2019s waist. The city hadn\u2019t brightened by\
  \ the morning\u2014everything was dull, colorless, and quiet. The only sound was\
  \ a screeching tram, emptier than I expected.\n\nI bought coffee and a piece of\
  \ pomme-poire cake at my favorite cafe. Cl\xE9ment, the charming owner, winked at\
  \ me as he set down my order. \u201CExtra cr\xE8me chantilly, as you like.\u201D\
  \ \n\n\u201CMerci.\u201D I looked down. \n\nHe tilted his head, eyes crinkling around\
  \ the corners. \u201CHow are you today? You are a little blue.\u201D \n\n\u201C\
  Just tired,\u201D I lied. \u201CI went to \u2018Base Camp\u2019 last night.\u201D\
  \n\n\u201CNon,\u201D he gasped, the way I imagine every French person needs to gasp\
  \ each day: Wide eyed and empathetic. \u201CI hate that place! Too loud. They have\
  \ a drink, even, when the bartender hits your face. Crazy.\u201D\n\nIt made me smile.\
  \ I sank a fork into the cake, soft and spongy. It had a perfectly decadent sweetness\
  \ with the shortest crunch from the bake on top. Paired with a sip of creamy, earthy\
  \ latte, it was utter euphoria on the glummest morning of my trip.\n\n\u201CCut\
  \ yourself some slack,\u201D I sighed, then yawned. Relief. \u201CHealing always\
  \ takes time.\u201D\n\nI guess you can always count on patisserie."
