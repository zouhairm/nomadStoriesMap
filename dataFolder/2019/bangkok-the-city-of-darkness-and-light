Text: "Smile upon arrival, smile to say thank you, smile to gently decline an offer,\
  \ smile and kindly accept the ride and embrace the giant city of Bangkok. Embrace\
  \ the crowd where you could possibly wait for 300 people before you can book a taxi.\
  \ Then keep a smile plastered on your face in the daunting traffic because at some\
  \ point you'll find it rewarding.\nJust because they are not confrontational and\
  \ they tend to act satisfied, I am not sure this is the case though. Bangkok above\
  \ all is oozing misery.\nI was heading to the river side seeking a BTS station after\
  \ a strenuous attempt to walk\_ to the reclining Buddha temple and stumbled on an\
  \ array of colorful housing that clearly belongs to the less fortunate population\
  \ of Bangkok. I kept roaming around, wandering inside and coming day after day after\
  \ day...You may wonder what's attractive in poor people housing?  Tons of things;\
  \ colors, simple decorations, plantations, utensils, footwear carefully placed on\
  \ their doormats, glimpses of neat comfortable rooms that may host too many people\
  \ considering its capacity. The place is simply booming with love and life. Although\
  \ I can imagine their every day worries; whether someone will fall into the river\
  \ tomorrow cause the wooden support couldn't hold it, or if the house will be washed\
  \ away in the next flood of rain or whether they will be able to feed the family\
  \ tomorrow.\nWhen walking on the touristic side like the night markets or red districts;\
  \ you'll be pestered with the sex shops and go go bars. The girls will suddenly\
  \ block your view with their menus explicitly dedicated to numerous vaginal activities\
  \ you didn't think were possible. I couldn't exactly nor directly relate to the\
  \ slums I've seen in the morning, I know the sex tourism is also active because\
  \ rural families sell or rent their girls to foreigner. As a girl my self, the thought\
  \ was nauseating.\nBack to the riverside slums; stories of violence, drugs and sexual\
  \ abuse are most common. The inhabitants are people who left their home towns with\
  \ a dream of a relaxed and wealthy live in Bangkok. However they ended up in small\
  \ spaces suffering from unemployment, poor hygiene, fragile infrastructure and ignorance.\_\
  \ There are numerous efforts to help and support the kids in these areas for a better\
  \ future, like the\_one\_that father Joe initiated. Those immigrants flow to Bangkok\
  \ bearing dreams and expecting endless opportunities. Those dreams crashed at the\
  \ feet of merciless employers that demand an insane schedule in exchange for a small\
  \ salary. \nAs a tourist, I felt responsible, that I played a part of at least making\
  \ others aware of what  damage they incur and what we are encouraging while lazily\
  \ spending a slim amount of money. I've witnessed sick abusers renting those girls\
  \ and treating them worse than how they would treat a doormat...\nIt was heart breaking,\
  \ Bangkok was a city I loved for the misery it conveys not for the pleasure it brings.\
  \ It's something that you don't need to research, it's obvious like a colorful sunset\
  \ by the sea. It's dirty and while you are spending your day riding tuktuks, fancy\
  \ boats, shopping in those cheap mega malls and wandering around Patpong you may\
  \ try to act blind but the stench will prevail."
