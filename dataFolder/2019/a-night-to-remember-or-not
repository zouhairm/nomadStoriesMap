Text: "A soft breeze met my warm body. A body lost into the night in one of the streets\
  \ of Lapa in the city of Rio de Janeiro. My head felt light, maybe it was because\
  \ of all the shots of cacha\xE7a cinnamon that I had had, or...It was the guy in\
  \ front of me. He was doing a performance of a poem from a brazilian poet, Drummond.\
  \ My ears were capturing every word, and my mind was going far way with those words,\
  \ making a graphic animation with it: \u201CFrom the shattered bottle, on the floor\
  \ already serene...A thick thing runs off which is milk or  blood...I do not know\u201D\
  , he said. He finished the the poem and suddenly my soul came back to the right\
  \ place, making me realise that I didn\u2019t know where Ana, my sister, was. I\
  \ looked around. Near the bar some people spread around the place, my new hippie\
  \ friends selling their art...No sign of her. \n        I felt kind of anxious,\
  \ where is she? I didn't see her going away. I took a breath and turned to one of\
  \ hippies, R\xF4mulo, maybe he kewn where she was. He didn\u2019t. Making me realise\
  \ that, maybe, it was not a good idea to hang out with the hippies after all.\n\t\
  I went back to the beginning of the afternoon. The air was fresh, though it was\
  \ a warm summer, me and Ana, were exploring the center of Rio. When you\u2019re\
  \ there you fell impress with the beauty of the old buildings and, at the same time,\
  \ it\u2019s depressing because they are in the middle of dirty streets that smell.\
  \ We were on our way to a Salvador Dali exhibition. When we arrived at the museum\
  \ there were some artists selling their work, I made eye contact with one of them,\
  \ he called me. I said: \u201CI\u2019ll see it on our way back\u201D. I could see\
  \ he was doubting me, and said, \u201COk\u201D.\n\tI lost track of time looking\
  \ at the peculiar paintings of Dali, but hours later the hippies were still there.\
  \ I stopped again, \u201CI said that I would come back\u201D. The hippie, his name\
  \ was R\xF4mulo, responded me smiling, \u201CThat\u2019s true!\u201D. Ana was by\
  \ my side feeling discomfortable though she got hooked to the conversation. When\
  \ we were about to leave he said: \u201CWe\u2019re going to a sarau at Lapa. Wanna\
  \ come?\u201D. Me and Ana looked to each other, and I said, \u201COk. But first\
  \ we\u2019re going to go the hotel. We need to shower\u201D. He looked at me again,\
  \ \u201CLet\u2019s see if you show\u201D.\n\tWe were exhausted when we arrived at\
  \ the hotel. But, we went out. Arriving there, I saw the Lapa arches illuminated\
  \ with the soft light of the streets. I got the address of the bar and went in the\
  \ direction given by google. We saw the bar and then the hippies...R\xF4mulo went\
  \ towards me. He couldn't believe that we showed up, \u201CI thought you\u2019re\
  \ not coming\u201D. We got excited with the vibe, people reciting poems, listening\
  \ to good samba songs, drinking cacha\xE7a and enjoying the night. I wanted to be\
  \ part of that. I drank one chacha\xE7a, two...I lost the count and...lost sight\
  \ of Ana. I think she was talking to one of the hippies... I lost track of me, and\
  \ then I found myself again when that poet guy from the beginning ended the poem.\
  \ \n\tWhen I finished revisiting my memories I heard a voice calling me. It was\
  \ Ana. Apparently, she went to buy 80-cent beer in the street next door. I got mad\
  \ and said, \u201CLet\u2019s go back to the hotel\u201D. R\xF4mulo heard me and\
  \ offered to leave us at the hotel with his friend. Don\u2019t know what came into\
  \ our drunk minds, but we said yes.\n\tIt\u2019s absurd when I remember the decisions\
  \ of the younger me. Walking back to the hotel with strangers? We were naive. The\
  \ four of us walked drunkenly on the streets...talking and reflecting about art,\
  \ life...We saw two people on the way... Drags? Maybe, to be honest, I don\u2019\
  t remember. Everything was foggy. We arrive at the hotel. Nothing happened. We said\
  \ our goodbyes to the boys. Never saw then again."
