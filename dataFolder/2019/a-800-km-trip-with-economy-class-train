Text: "It is almost 8 years after the reformation of train transportation in Indonesia.\
  \ Many years ago, when you booked economy-class train ticket, you will get a railway\
  \ coach with a fan on the ceiling, a non-reclining seat, and busy hawkers hustling\
  \ all the time. What do you expect from a economy train that is designed and used\
  \ for low income people? That is the old story of economy-class train, now you will\
  \ face a complete different situation. You will have an AC, a reclining seat for\
  \ limited economy-class train, and no more hawkers! Having curious with the new\
  \ experience, I made my first economy-class train trip for a 800 km distance, from\
  \ Jakarta, the capital city of Indonesia, to Surabaya. It is gonna be an excited\
  \ journey.  \n\nIt was noon in December at Senen Station. Senen Station has been\
  \ known as the largest economy-class train station in Jakarta. Two hours before\
  \ my departure, passengers had started arriving. At the entrance, the Station Officer\
  \ started to inform the passengers of the train\u2019s arrival schedule. At 13.00\
  \ PM, the train enters the platform. I have a number 4 railway coach with a window\
  \ seat. As a traveler, I always choose a window seat. Window seat has many privileges,\
  \ it provides a nice view and more comfortable seat. Since I bought a premium economy\
  \ ticket, I have a reclining seat, so I can relaxed my body during the next 14 hours\
  \ trip. 20 minutes after entering the platform, my train was ready to leave the\
  \ station.\n\nYou can call him Budiman. He is my seat mate, and a high school teacher\
  \ in Solo, around 8 hours trip from Jakarta. He just had a two day training in Jakarta,\
  \ but he is not coming back to Solo. He will visit his family in Madiun, located\
  \ around 3 hours trip from Solo. \u201CIt has been 2 years since I leave my family\
  \ in Madiun,\u201D he whispered. \n\nHe can not leave his job in Solo. At least,\
  \ once a week, he will visit his family in Madiun. He wouldn\u2019t mind living\
  \ like this. \u201CWhenever I miss my family, I can visit them. It\u2019s not far\
  \ from Solo,\u201D he smiled.   \n\nI can hear a small chat from my back. Apparently,\
  \ there was a small discussion between an old man and a middle age woman. The old\
  \ man told the woman about his car rental business near Solo. Once, he answered\
  \ a phone call from his customer. The way the old man told about his business, make\
  \ the woman very excited.\n\nThat is the unique characteristic when you had a economy-class\
  \ train trip. You will meet various people, from a businessman, urban workers, teachers,\
  \ backpackers till farmers. They have their own stories, but their similarity is\
  \ traveling with a low cost. Yes, you can buy a train ticket with only a \xBC price\
  \ from executive class. \n\nOne that doesn\u2019t change, as a economy-class train,\
  \ it is usual when your train have to stop in each station, compare to executive-class\
  \ train. That was the excited part when you take a economy-class train trip. When\
  \ you had your train stop, you can chat with many people, from a Local Station Officer,\
  \ hawkers at a local station and other passengers. You will get a benefit from that,\
  \ communicating with other people. One thing that you can\u2019t get when you live\
  \ in a big city like in Jakarta.    \n    \nIt has been 11 hours and my seat mate\
  \ has left the train. Thinking that I have a new experiences in this train, I smiled\
  \ and relaxing my body before my arrival."
