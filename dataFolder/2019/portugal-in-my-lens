Text: "Portugal, In my Lens In the story of my journey, it will contain Portugal and\
  \ all its beauty, a digital nomad, I see Portugal as a historical break from the\
  \ inca tribal line and virtual, Portugal is an old nation born of the civilization\
  \ of travelers, they came to Indonesia in 1511 to the Malay region of Sumatra, West\
  \ Indonesia. In my wandering this time I can't possibly have many words because\
  \ of the natural beauty and splendor of the rest of the culture from the culture\
  \ that I will write, my lens that will explain, I hope you guys like it \n\nIn East\
  \ Indonesia, the Flores Islands which are mainly Roman Catholics, I once lived with\
  \ them as a television journalist, it was quite easy for me to get along with the\
  \ people, religious diversity became a beautiful acculturation of God's form here,\
  \ I often appreciate quite humane experiences and brothers on this island , whereas\
  \ I myself came from another region, precisely Java Island, which is predominantly\
  \ Muslim, because of that, the maturity attitude of eastern Indonesian people who\
  \ respect respect for differences between people makes the Indonesian father find\
  \ five basic social life, called Pancasila, what are those historical memories ,\
  \ the tolerance of the rest of Portuguese culture on the island of Flores which\
  \ is still maintained is a complement to the beauty of Indonesian culture"
