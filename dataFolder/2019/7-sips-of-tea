Text: "The green iron can has now become empty. We divided the last leaves into two\
  \ cups. I got a little twig; we were avoiding it for the last 18 months, but it\
  \ had to get into the cup of one of us eventually. \nNow, 7 sips of tea \u2014 and\
  \ 7 myths that were destroyed by the place from where we brought that tea.\n\n#1.\
  \ Even the biggest island could be passed over during 1 day.\nThe Azores. S\xE3\
  o Miguel. 20 km north of Ponta Delgada, the capital of island. Our host is Laura.\
  \ Her grandfather built that house in 1924. \n\u2014\tWhat it\u2019s like \u2014\
  \ to live on the island? \nLaura had visited her aunt in Lisbon, but her husband\
  \ never saw \xABthe big land\xBB. He told us that he couldn\u2019t imagine a day\
  \ without the voice of ocean.\n\nBefore our journey I knew that S\xE3o Miguel is\
  \ a big island. But I couldn`t imagine that 3 days by car wouldn\u2019t be enough\
  \ to look around it. \n\n#2 Tea is grown in Ceylon or in Sri Lanka.\nAnd in Europe!\
  \ Laura grows it in her yard. She showed me little sprouts with lush leaves. There\
  \ is a tea plantation on S\xE3o Miguel, the only one in Europe. \nThe tea in our\
  \ green can was from that plantation.\n\n#3 The pineapples grow\u2026 \nI never\
  \ thought how they do it \u2014 maybe on a palm tree?\nTurns out, every pineapple\
  \ has its own bush and sits on. That bush lifts his pineapple closer to the sky,\
  \ and only thin glass walls and ceiling keep pineapple from reaching the Sun.\n\n\
  #4 Cooking by volcano? Only if you are the Little Prince.\nAnd that\u2019s when\
  \ I tasted cozido. Batatas, potatoes, carrots, onions and 5 kinds of meat are put\
  \ into the mouth of a volcano for one night. The next midday you can taste that\
  \ dish. \nCould you imagine \u2014 cozido has a light smell of volcano and a perfect\
  \ condition of every ingredient. \nAs if volcano likes to cook more than to erupt.\n\
  \n#5 Fluffy mandarins.\nMandarin is not an exotic fruit in my country. So, I didn\u2019\
  t expect anything special \u2014 just mandarins. Then I found out something that\
  \ shocked me.\n\nFruits in their motherland and fruits brought to our countries\
  \ by planes and ships differ greatly. Formally they are very similar in color and\
  \ shape \u2014 kiwi, mangoes, pineapples, citrus fruits \u2014 but at home fruit\
  \ have some homey aroma and sun flavor. \nThose mandarins also had gentle white\
  \ bloom.   \n\n#6 To be lost in paradise\nCamellias confused me. I have never seen\
  \ trees with such bright and abundant flowers. They allure to come closer, to touch\
  \ the flowers, to smell them \u2014 but no fragrance, at all!\nWe walked through\
  \ the camellias garden together, and then we separated. \nAnd I got lost.\nIt was\
  \ fun at first, but after a quarter of an hour of searches the kidding was over.\
  \ I began to halloo \u2014 dead silence. \nSomehow I felt as all this story was\
  \ a fairy-tale \u2014 my prince, his white horse and the plane which brought us\
  \ there. \n\nAnd then kind camellias let him to come back to me.\n\n#7 In the middle\
  \ of the ocean you can be surprised by city culture.\nAzores white churches amazed\
  \ me with their delicate black roof lines, which looked like stems of hedge. I didn`t\
  \ want to step on the paving stones \u2014 so harmonic and so polished. Also the\
  \ hortensias \u2014 they seemed to move to the walls from the flower beds and settled\
  \ there in frescoes and graffiti.\nAt Laura\u2019s villa we had pearl soap cushions\
  \ and a jug with water to wash up in the morning. The stairs creaked wisely under\
  \ our feet, the centenary Portuguese watched at us from the walls, and every evening\
  \ Laura closed ancient wooden shutters \u2014 to protect home from the ocean. \n\
  \n\u201CWe won\u2019t tell you everything, \u2014 the waves said on our last night\
  \ there. \u2014 You still have questions about our black tiny sand, the oak with\
  \ roots in the ocean, the air thoroughly wet with moisture.\nAnd you won\u2019t\
  \ get answers. \nBut we present you with something. \nFeel \u2014 you are part of\
  \ world. The world is ambiguous\u201D.\n\nAnd I feel it."
