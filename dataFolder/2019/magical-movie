Text: "After riding 2 hours in the countryside of the city lakes at north India, cooking\
  \ chapati and singing with children\u2019s, we went to the unique bottle shop to\
  \ buy some beers. After that we stop to see some clothes in a little shop at the\
  \ corners of our apartment, when suddenly an old men start talking to my boyfriend\
  \ invited him to play chest. \nI wasn\u2019t hear at all when I go out and he start\
  \ talking to me. He told me that is the third time that he saw me in two days, and\
  \ that he is a palm reader famous in India and if we want that for free.\nWe thought,\
  \ for free??? No one does anything here for free. But we decided to trust. So we\
  \ put up to his motorbike and start riding across thousand of others , shouting,\
  \ feeling a little bit of Adrenalin, with none thought in our minds.\nSo we arrived.\
  \ A shop art in the middle of a little town with the most beautiful draws that I\
  \ ever seen. The old men look at me and says \u201Cyou first\u201D, so I lay back\
  \ in a little bed in the middle and he took my both hands and started crying. He\
  \ told me that he was waiting for me for many years, that I am TARA, a godnnes from\
  \ the stars, that he met me thousand of years ago in the same country. Then he took\
  \ his hand and put over my bodie and start talking about what I felt. I start crying.\
  \ Everything was making sense and was the first time that someone understood me\
  \ about my feelings. \nThen we drunk the best chai ever and when we say goodbye\
  \ he gave me two stars ruby, a precious stone, and when I understand all that he\
  \ told me I should comeback and gave him back. All that day I felt like floating\
  \ and then I understood that India have so many beautiful palace, landscapes and\
  \ amazing food. But India is the people that make you feel like in a magical movie."
