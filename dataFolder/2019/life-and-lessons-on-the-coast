Text: "A paradise compared to rainy New York, I landed in Naples before heading to\
  \ the old town of Ravello, located in the hills of Campania. With eyes glued to\
  \ the window of the car, I watched the beautiful winding roads that took me 1200\
  \ feet up the coast with a view of Pompeii and Naples on one end, and the Mediterranean\
  \ Sea on the other.\n\n\u201CFollow me,\u201D said a welcoming voice who escorted\
  \ me down the dirt road the car had parked, to my bed & breakfast directly outside\
  \ the town square. Quickly dropping my bags, the sunny skies and slight summer breeze\
  \ pulled me to the streets of Ravello. I popped my head into shops to sample limoncello,\
  \ watch vendors create leather shoes, and venture inside the infamous \u201CWine\
  \ and Drugs\u201D store. Hints of lemon poked through everywhere: the trees, pottery,\
  \ food, and apparel. As the sun set over the coast I sat enjoying a slice of tiramisu\
  \ with lemon. In the distance, I could hear a live concert in the town square. Squinting,\
  \ I could see the locals dancing with one another, all smiles and laughter.\n\n\
  In the morning I awoke to an Italian breakfast of pastries, fruit, sliced meats,\
  \ and beverages. As I tried to take my cappuccino to-go, I was met with heavy stares.\
  \ I quickly learned the Italian way is to slow down, sit, and enjoy your beverage\
  \ -- such a stark contrast from what I was accustomed to in New York. The fact that\
  \ there weren\u2019t any to-go lids to accommodate portability spoke volumes. Appreciative\
  \ for the cultural lesson, I finished my coffee seated.\n\nLuckily the locals forgave\
  \ me and I walked down the mountain\u2019s dirt road. Along my path I discovered\
  \ a modest family weaving baskets on the front porch. When I inquired about them,\
  \ the mother, Aggy, offered to teach me how to make one of my own. I took a seat\
  \ on their porch alongside a large pile of plants from their garden. Step by step,\
  \ Aggy taught me how to use my hands to weave; noting how flimsy plant rods slowly\
  \ formed into a strong, durable item. The father, Paolo, embodied hospitality as\
  \ well, rolling out cheeses, bread, lemons and fruits harvested from the family\
  \ grove. Bottles of prosecco and wine were passed and once completed, Aggy announced\
  \ that I was a part of their \u201Cband.\u201D\n\nThat afternoon I shuttled to the\
  \ hilltop town of Agerola to hike to Positano on a trek dubbed, The Path of the\
  \ Gods or Sentiero Degli Dei. While mesmerized by the views, I managed to meet and\
  \ converse with Anna, who kept me pumped up and motivated throughout the five-mile\
  \ hike. Anna, born and raised in the region, lived in the outskirts of Ravello with\
  \ her sisters and parents. As I described the beautiful sites back home in New York\
  \ she would always exclaim \u201CMama Mia!\u201D Along the trail, we enjoyed magnificent\
  \ views of the Mediterranean Sea, neighboring towns, homes and buildings from hundreds\
  \ of years prior. Nearly 3.5 hours later, after going up and down the hills, we\
  \ arrived at the quaint town of Positano where we watched the sunset together.\n\
  \nOn top of a lush grove, I met Chiara who was busy gathering the natural ingredients\
  \ of her family\u2019s grove to supply her cooking school. I entered her home 1000\
  \ feet above sea level, where I was practically in the clouds that foggy day. In\
  \ the kitchen, Chiara and her husband, Gennaro, laughed while sharing their generational\
  \ cooking techniques. Eight hours later I was still laughing with Chiara and her\
  \ family, who filled me with snacks, limoncello and wine in-between lessons. At\
  \ one point it started raining outside and Chiara exclaimed, \u201CLook, there\u2019\
  s the romance!\u201D To her, the rain wasn\u2019t ruining the day, it was adding\
  \ romance to the day.\n\nIn the heart of the Amalfi Coast, I am forever thankful\
  \ for three women who embraced me like family and reminded me to slow down: Aggy\
  \ for sharing the reward of patience, Anna for showcasing wonderment in the small\
  \ things, and Chiara for finding beauty in seemingly dreary moments."
