Text: "This New year's Eve, I didn't want to booze away into the new year. The only\
  \ outcome of doing that would be finding weird pictures of my drunken self and a\
  \ hangover that would've lasted at least two days. So I decided to take an impromptu\
  \ trip with my boyfriend and my family.\n\nWhere you ask? Oh only the world's richest\
  \ city once upon a time ago. Hampi, located in Bellary District of Karnataka, is\
  \ a World Heritage site, known to have flourished during the Vijayanagara Empire\
  \ around 900 years ago. Known as the City of Ruins, Hampi still stands on the face\
  \ of earth, majority of it torn apart but still majestic and gleaming in the hot\
  \ sun. \n\nI reside in Bangalore. And Hampi was about 6 hours of drive. Our hotel\
  \ was far from our destination and it took me a couple of fights with the destined\
  \ driver aka my boyfriend regarding navigation and a few extra hours to reach there.\
  \ On our way, we did pay a visit the well known Chitradurga fort and heard a fun\
  \ little tale. During the raid by the Mughal Empire, the fort was once used as a\
  \ barrier and housed armed soldiers and battalions. When one such soldier was resting\
  \ during noon and having his lunch, his wife called Oneke Obava, heard a rustling\
  \ sound. Apparently, the Mughal troops had crept in through a crevice in the fort.\
  \ Legend says, she fought off most of them using the log used to grind rice into\
  \ powder. Such are the tales buried in sand surrounding the city of Hampi. A little\
  \ bit of detour took us longer to reach.\nOnce we checked in Hotel Samartha Comforts,\
  \ we ordered food since we were famished and called it a night. The following morning\
  \ we drove down to Hampi and the sight that greeted my eyes was enough to transport\
  \ me back into time. I wished we had the technology to do so, maybe with glasses\
  \ that had time traveling powers.\n\nThe first monument that we took a tour of was\
  \ the Queen's bath. It is the most extravagant bath there is known to me. The word\
  \ extravagant would still be an understatement. Protected by a canal on all four\
  \ sides to keep away perverts and the like, the bath had unique domes arching above\
  \ me, each with a hand crafted and chiseled design. On all four fronts there were\
  \ changing rooms for the queens and the handiwork of skilled labourers were there\
  \ for everyone to view. To be astounded by just one of the many monuments in Hampi,\
  \ and I had more to look forward to.\n\nThe weather was scorching hot and dry, but\
  \ we made our way to ancient architecture, weaving a trail through time. The Hazarama\
  \ Temple, with 1000 scenes from the Ramayana, the Elephant Stable in its grandiosity\
  \ reserved for the royal elephants of the time. The Virupaksha Temple, standing\
  \ tall in all its sacred glamour, The Vittala Complex housing the musical stones\
  \ and the Stone Chariot. Domingo Paes, a visitor during 1520-22AD, remarks that\
  \ during the peak of its prosperity, Hampi had its streets filled with sellers of\
  \ precious stones, gold and with oxen attracting customers from in and out of the\
  \ nation. \n\nWe were awestruck at every point of our journey through the sandy\
  \ lanes of Hampi and we were exhausted due to the heat as well To take a break,\
  \ we had a lovely lunch at a restaurant called Mango tree, an aesthetic and lively\
  \ area. \n\nTo end the day, we decided to climb our way upto Matanga hill. And I,\
  \ being the unfit human that I am, was wheezing by the time we reached the top,\
  \ or close enough to it. But what took my breath away was not the climb but the\
  \ sun slowly setting into the west, a burst of orange and pinks all coming together\
  \ to an inexplicable shade and making it the most beautiful sunset that I have seen,\
  \ etched only in my memory\n\nI will soon go back to Hampi to explore more and for\
  \ a city who beckons me back for more, The City of Ruins does not disappoint me\
  \ one bit."
