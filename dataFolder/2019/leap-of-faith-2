Text: 'The Asian country with a totally different culture and a nature rich environment
  just held my senses back in the week long holiday trip. While the mountains were
  dripping with the fragrance of vegetation, the plains were soaking wet with abundance
  of rainfall taking over in the whole of the place.

  Kathmandu, the capital of Nepal was not only welcoming but it also had the essence
  of city feel to it which helped in attaining a blend of both living by the country
  side and living in the citylights. From  the spirituality attained in the lord mahadeva
  temple to the rejoice of night life in the night clubs everything felt to be completely
  different in comparison to my native place.

  Pokhra the state which helped in bringing out a new me by enduring me to take a
  leap of faith over the nice blue sky to the grounds of the city. The adventure sports
  loving people were not only crazy to enjoy it but also possessed another level of
  hospitality which lack in the rest of the world. The Nepalese cuisine was always
  something to die for providing large varieties of starters, Main courses, mouth
  watering deserts, and beverages.

  The weddings were also kind of different having the couples in simple outfits rejoicing
  towards a new dawn of their life.'
