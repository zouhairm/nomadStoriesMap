Text: "Since I was little my grandma and my aunt used to tell me everything about\
  \ their trips, to China, Italy, France, and some other countries in Europe. I remembered\
  \ to think I really want to be traveling one day when I grow up.  As I was growing\
  \ one of the biggest obstacles I had, or I think I had, was not having enough money.\
  \ When I say I think I had I said it because It was just a belief that I was learning\
  \ it in my environment and I believed it was truth.\n\nEven in college when I had\
  \ the opportunity to apply to a scholarship I didn't believe enough in myself to\
  \ stand up for myself and to go for it. For that opportunity that could have taken\
  \ me to California. But now I do believe that things are working for us, for a reason.\
  \ One of these reasons is to force us to grow.\n\nThat's what happened exactly 9\
  \ years later when I took a leap of faith into the unknown. For the first time in\
  \ my life, I was certain to move to another country. I always had a thing and still\
  \ have for Paris, however, I  chose California because I love the sun, the sea,\
  \ the beach and I just loved California. I remember I took this decision in a personal\
  \ development seminar and my best friend encouraged me to move and to prepare myself\
  \ by reading a book from one of our mentors. \n\nAnd so I did, with a couple bucks\
  \ in my pocket but a heart full of excitement, I moved to California. I was so happy\
  \ and so close to the beach, but by the second week in San Diego, I was cashless.\
  \ But this was just the beginning. I started helping my best friend with his dad\
  \ who was 100 years old at the time. He already passed away last year. He taught\
  \ me so much of how 100 years can pass by if you don't live your life to the fullest.\
  \ He made me laugh and, to be honest with you, he taught me patience as well. There\
  \ were days that I was driving me nuts, but something inside me, that inner voice,\
  \ my instinct was telling me to stay and so I did.\n\nI decided to be open to new\
  \ experiences, starting with learning new ways to think and also allowing the universe\
  \ to bring me marvelous things. While I was immersing myself in the culture I improved\
  \ my English speaking a lot, California style baby. And discovered so many places\
  \ either in San Diego, Los Angeles, Dallas, and some other beautiful places. As\
  \ I was discovering these places I understood that I was getting to know myself\
  \ in a way that I never did before.\n\nI really became more aware of my fears, but\
  \ also of how strong I am and how I can overcome a broken heart, how can I manifest\
  \ a new reality, and how blessed I am by just appreciating every moment. Because\
  \ of this leap of faith, I found one of my gurus in a meditation temple. Don't get\
  \ wrong I'm not the religious type, but I do believe we are spiritual beings living\
  \ physical experiences as Wayne Dyer once said.\n\nIn this journey, I also met my\
  \ sister from another mother, as Americans say. She remembers me that there's always\
  \ a solution for everything, she is the example that when you take a decision the\
  \ Universe helps you to make it happen. She helped me to certificate myself as a\
  \ Life Coach and to love myself so hard that I can raise my standards. She believes\
  \ in me, I love her.\n\nAnother person that really has touched my heart, is an actor,\
  \ with a great vision, and a great heart although he's always trying to hide his\
  \ feelings. He helped me to see the world with new eyes and although we're complete\
  \ opposites I love him dearly, we are now friends. \n\nAll these experiences have\
  \ made me what I am today, a strong and powerful soul. But this is not just about\
  \ me, it's possible for everyone that still believe in their dreams."
