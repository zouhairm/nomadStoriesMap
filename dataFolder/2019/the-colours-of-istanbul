Text: "Saturday. I got up so early and excited for the new day. That day I decided\
  \ to explore more of this beautiful city Istanbul. I sat on the bus and waited impatiently\
  \ to arrive at the planned place. The bus ride took so long.. During the ride, I\
  \ was thinking about the day and my expectations. Is that place going to be nice?\
  \ am I going to like it?\n\nAnd finally, the time for the last bus stop came. I\
  \ arrived in Aksaray and from there I started walking.. and I walked, I walked\u2026\
  \ up to the hill, through the neighborhood of Fatih and after an hour  I arrived\
  \ at the coziest and most colorful part of Istanbul.\n\nThere were so many tiny\
  \ streets and I was wondering which way to take. Somewhere in the distance, I saw\
  \ some colorful buildings shining brightly as if they were touched by the sun. I\
  \ went that way and heard some voices of women fighting and a policeman standing\
  \ there. I didn\u2019t understand the situation, I just walked by and freaked out,\
  \ because I didn\u2019t have my documents with me\u2026 and going out without documents\
  \ in a foreign country as a non-European can be a problem. Then I realized that\
  \ I am in Turkey and problem yok! (no problem).\n\nBalat, Istanbul\n\nI took some\
  \ pictures of course and continued my way. I was expecting so many tourists, but\
  \ it was empty. I could just only hear the voices of the angry women and some children\
  \ yelling  Anne, Anne!(mom, mom).\n\nAfter those buildings, I got into one very\
  \ empty street with no people living in the houses around. They were too old obviously.\
  \ I was walking around for some minutes, trying to find more things and I finally\
  \ arrived in front of one house for children which I believe was something like\
  \ a small theater. It was really nicely decorated, with drawings as clowns and dolls\
  \ in different colors. Inside, it was very small, of course, made for children to\
  \ fit in and it was full of toys. Around there were children jumping while getting\
  \ excited about the next game they were going to play and there were even some of\
  \ them selling books to the people passing by.\n\nTurkish tea\n\nThe other streets\
  \ were filled with more of those cute houses which had many vintage shops and cafes\
  \ above them. I got the desire to have a Turkish tea in front of one of them and\
  \ to enjoy the relaxed and silent Saturday morning in this amazing area. I ordered\
  \ my tea to the redhead waitress and I started reading my book. I could also feel\
  \ the smell of peacefulness, hot Turkish coffee and fresh simit in the air. From\
  \ time to time I could also hear the laughing of the people sitting at the next\
  \ cafe which was not destroying the atmosphere at all\u2026 instead, it was fitting\
  \ perfectly.\n\nAfter I drank my tea I walked a bit down the same street and I saw\
  \ some tourists, so I decided to follow them. After many hours in this neighborhood,\
  \ I heard some loud voices and I saw the crowd. There was a cafe full of people\
  \ taking pictures on the stairs colored in different ways. To be honest, this impressed\
  \ me a lot because it was made really good and the vibes were even better. There\
  \ were not many empty tables, I just walked in to see and even though we are in\
  \ early autumn already, at that moment I could feel the waves of the oceans and\
  \ the summer breeze which mace me feel fine.\n\nNext, to it there was a street covered\
  \ with red umbrellas and here is where I finished my wandering and ended up as in\
  \ a maze since I couldn\u2019t find the way which I came from. I took another one\
  \ which was longer and tired me so much, but I won\u2019t complain, because it was\
  \ really good and worth spending one Saturday there. Balat is really warm, special\
  \ and different."
