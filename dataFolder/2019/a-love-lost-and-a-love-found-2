Text: "Beautiful beaches,  breathtaking scenes, lovely people, and the most amazing\
  \ food I've ever eaten.  Puerto Rico was truly a dream. A paradise I never thought\
  \ I would experience.  Waking up every morning was better then the dreams from the\
  \ night before.  It doesn't get old being stunned by the scene of clean pure beaches\
  \ everyday.  You're stomach never tires of mofongo and platanos.  And you're heart\
  \ can not help but be constantly overflowing with contentment and joy.  I went to\
  \ Puerto Rico with a man I loved and fell in love again, but with the island this\
  \ time.   Today I do not have him in my life but the fondness that I have for PR\
  \ remains with me.  I embraced the language, and Latin rhythms from the night and\
  \ basked in the sun and waves by day. Exploring the cities I found that not only\
  \ people but places can captivate your heart as well.  \nEveryday was a new adventure\
  \ and I was enamored with every piece of the island that the sun touched.  And the\
  \ island was welcoming as well. Inviting me to enjoy all of what it had to offer.\
  \  Not only were the people accommodating but also very immersive when it came to\
  \ sharing culture."
