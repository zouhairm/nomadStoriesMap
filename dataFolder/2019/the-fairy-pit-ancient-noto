Text: "Everything starts from a demolished city, from that collection of ruins that\
  \ adds up in the space and become an image.\nWalls and fortifications survive, despite\
  \ all, they are relics, filled with memory and history. The earthquake in 1693 marked\
  \ this place, and the vegetation protected it.\nI\u2019ve not studied botany, but\
  \ I\u2019d like to give a name to everything. I content myself with recognising\
  \ the smell of aromatic plants, which is already a first form of cataloging.\nThrough\
  \ the underbrush I break up the landscape, then I look far away towards the rocks,\
  \ the canyons or better still the \u201Cquarries\u201D, like we call them here.\n\
  The exploration begins, the cumulative effect makes this place a succession of superimpositions,\
  \ a constant dialogue between Nature and culture.\nFor long time the openings among\
  \ the rocks have been tanneries, furnaces, mills, cisterns. Thus that place summarises\
  \ the history of humanity, of technology. The culture of stone becomes tale, in\
  \ a constant dialogue between space and time.\nThe exploration is composed of pauses\
  \ and changes: light, vegetation, rocks and sounds change, and from these changes\
  \ I sketch an archive of the crossing.\nSome landscapes seem to acquire special\
  \ qualities, and I try to figure out what holds me, why do I decide to stay despite\
  \ the night and the rain. I\u2019m not used to the night noises of the underbrush,\
  \ I look for a familiarity with the environment but I can\u2019t find it. I try\
  \ to give a name to every sound, recognising them and naming them seems to provide\
  \ some certainty.\nResuming the walk the quarries become background and the land\
  \ becomes damper, sudden rains slow the steps down but don\u2019t impede the crossing.\
  \ Someone lit a fire, I hold a mug of coffee in my hands and walk cautiously on\
  \ the wet ground For a moment I forget the destroyed city, the tanneries,\nI follow\
  \ the sound of water and the morning light.\nThere are moments in which something\
  \ unexpected irrupts in our daily lives, a mirage, jolts, fractures, visions. When\
  \ I saw the lake, I understood that the journey was over. I stood there for a couple\
  \ of minutes, then I heard some steps and someone saying: Here it is, the fairy\
  \ pit."
