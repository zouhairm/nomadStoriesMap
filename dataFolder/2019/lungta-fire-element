Text: "It was our second day in Thimphu, Bhutan and our guide Kinga took us to the\
  \ Jungshi Paper Factory to see how the locals make paper from the bark of Daphne\
  \ trees. As with all handicraft tours, there was a store at the end where you can\
  \ purchase products made from this paper. Upon entering the store, my eyes locked\
  \ on a black framed painting hanging on the wall. I stared at it for a while, mesmerized.\
  \ Before leaving, I asked the young man working there how much it cost but left\
  \ empty handed because it was out of my price range. That night, I had a very vivid\
  \ dream about the painting. In the morning, I told my travel companion Danica about\
  \ my dream and we agreed it was a sign. I needed to see the painting again, but\
  \ we were leaving for two nights in Punakha Valley. Since we had to drive through\
  \ Thimphu on our way to Paro a few days later, Kinga graciously agreed to take us\
  \ back for another look at the painting. When I walked into the store two amazing\
  \ days later, the wall looked different. The painting was gone, another painting\
  \ hanging in its place. On my behalf, Kinga spoke to the same young man who had\
  \ previously given me the price and discovered that the painting had just been sold.\
  \ Before the disappointment could sink in, Kinga informed me that the young man\
  \ was in fact the artist, Tshering Wangdi, and he had offered to paint another one\
  \ for me. We were leaving Bhutan in two days, which allowed just enough time for\
  \ Tshering to recreate the painting, let it dry, package it for safe traveling,\
  \ and drive the hour from Thimphu to Paro so I would have it the night before leaving\
  \ the country. It took about five hours to paint and Tshering sent progress photos\
  \ to Kinga to make sure it was the painting I wanted before I agreed to pay for\
  \ it. Tshering was picking up a friend at the airport in Paro the next day and said\
  \ if I was satisfied with the painting, he would drop it off at my hotel in exchange\
  \ for payment. However, since we were out hiking Tiger\u2019s Nest Monastery (Takshang\
  \ Goemba) that day, and Kinga didn\u2019t want any confusion leaving the money with\
  \ the hotel staff, Tshering agreed to leave the painting without payment and allow\
  \ Kinga to deliver it to him back in Thimphu after he took us to the airport the\
  \ following morning. In a quasi-drug deal style arrangement, I purchased the painting\
  \ from Tshering. The effort that went into this purchase is a testament to the generous,\
  \ trusting and happy people of Bhutan. The painting is called Lungta Fire Element,\
  \ and Kinga told me that lungta means \u201Cgood fortune\u201D. Essentially, I commissioned\
  \ a piece of art during my journey in Bhutan. I can\u2019t actually describe in\
  \ words what drew me to this painting, but I knew it was meant to come home with\
  \ me. It took more than a year before I opened the carefully packaged painting,\
  \ and to my delight, it was just as mesmerizing. Today, it hangs in my living room,\
  \ the first piece of art one sees when they enter my little apartment in Los Angeles.\
  \ When I returned home from nine months of traveling, I started by own business,\
  \ Lungta Consulting. I had recently posted an update to a blog I\u2019d written\
  \ about the painting with a picture of it framed on my wall. With my good fortune,\
  \ Tshering somehow found and commented on my blog. I had spent weeks unsuccessfully\
  \ trying to locate him on social media and somehow, he found me. Tshering and I\
  \ became friends on Facebook and after I told him about my consulting business,\
  \ I asked if I could pay him to draw me a logo. Less than 24 hours later, Tshering\
  \ sent me six logo options at no cost and while they were all beautiful, one stood\
  \ out among the rest and became the logo I am using today for Lungta Consulting."
