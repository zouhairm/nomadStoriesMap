Text: "There was once a time in my life when I had the pleasure of staying in a mansion.\
  \ The property was expansive, bigger than my own home, it boasted three floors,\
  \ rooms for the immediate family and extended alike, an area for a garden and goats,\
  \ both of which are raised the be sold for profit. My host was gracious enough to\
  \ offer me his own sleeping quarters. Upon my arrival, he presented me a series\
  \ of fine blankets for my use. He was so selfless for the fact that the blankets\
  \ I decided I did not need, he would leave them in my company in case I decided\
  \ I wanted another layer during the night. The walls have aged beautifully within\
  \ my habitation. Once white, with the passage of time and body, it has become a\
  \ golden hue. The richness of this home need not come from the monetary value of\
  \ the land or structures, for it has a plethora in the non traditional sense. This\
  \ room does not need a system to heat, because the love of family these walls have\
  \ seen have almost scorched my skin. As time passes and family members come and\
  \ go, the walls only grow in their power.\nI never in my life have eaten as well\
  \ as I did during this time. In fact, many times during this past semester, I would\
  \ be starving, not eating for more than twelve hours of the day. Each time that\
  \ I sat at the table, I was given a three course meal. Each plate presented to me\
  \ had a name in Hindi, another in Nepali, and one in English, but I would fill up\
  \ on the first two so by the time the third helping came around, I found it of little\
  \ interest learning the English names. \nNot only this, but the immediate family\
  \ saw it most fit to invite the grandparents into their estate on a permanent basis.\
  \ Both parties benefit, for the wisdom of life that the grandparents occurred can\
  \ now be passed on, and the other family members can take care of their elders,\
  \ further strengthening the bond of a family. \nBy no means does this family live\
  \ a typical life and in a typical home, but why would they? They have made their\
  \ own slice of paradise in a mortal world\u2026"
