Text: "A loud, bellowing, distressed sound echoed through the Jasper campsite where\
  \ we had just climbed into our little tent. It had come from the river which was\
  \ rushing past below the bank a stone's through away from our campsite. Unsettling\
  \ myself from the tent, camera in hand I decided to go and investigate... \n\nA\
  \ small group of people had obviously heard the same noise as they were gathering\
  \ in an open area near the riverbank. When we turned to look at a park ranger charging\
  \ down through the campsite with bear spray in hand, we suddenly became aware of\
  \ what was likely to have made the unusual bellow. As the minutes passed with no\
  \ sign of the animal or further noise, the excitement seemed to wane, so I decided\
  \ to make my way back along the bank, toward camp... until I ran into a roadblock.\
  \ \n\nPassing through trees with my eye on the far bank in case of a bear sighting,\
  \ I suddenly stopped dead as a large female grizzly bear lumbered into view having\
  \ scaled the steep river bank to emerge directly on the path 15m from me. As she\
  \ turned her long nose and dark eyes toward me, a couple of long seconds passed\
  \ as we both stood looking at each other, punctuated only by my increasing heart\
  \ rate\u2026until suddenly my flight instinct kicked in. \n\nMeanwhile back in our\
  \ tent, Taylor my partner had finally given in to curiosity and sat up to peer through\
  \ the gauze of the tent, as he did so the blue flash of my shirt caught his eye\
  \ as it moved rapidly through the trees. Before he'd had time to come to any rational\
  \ conclusion about why I might be sprinting barefoot through the campsite, the distinct\
  \ shape of a grizzly bear moved quickly through the trees behind me. \n\nI had turned\
  \ to run without any conscious thought, but as my mind caught up to my movement\
  \ I began to recall the age-old advice that 'one should not run from bears', looping\
  \ around off the track and back toward the tent I saw the bear head down the path\
  \ away from me, so in an excited mania I ran to the tent to tell Taylor of my encounter..but\
  \ Taylor wasn't in the mode for a story. \n\nIn frenzy of motion, Taylor had grabbed\
  \ bear-spray and a hunting knife and burst like a madman from the tent in his underwear\
  \ spraying sleeping bag and mat in every direction, just as I emerged between the\
  \ trees near the tent. Taylor, assuming the grizzly was still behind me and that\
  \ I had now lured it back to our campsite, had launched himself into the cab of\
  \ the truck and was hollering loudly that I do the same.\n\nI meanwhile was a little\
  \ bamboozled as to such a dramatic response, I had no idea that I had actually been\
  \ followed as my only glimpse of the bear had been after it had changed direction.\
  \ Taylor, now realizing that a bear mauling death was not imminent was able to explain\
  \ from the truck in his underwear that the bear had pursued me along the path as\
  \ I had run.\n\nThe next morning as we left the campground the park ranger confirmed\
  \ the situation: A female grizzly had lost her cubs near the campsite that evening.\
  \ Probably the number one bear situation to avoid. Perhaps I had been considerably\
  \ lucky to only get away with an ultimate Canadian experience and a good tale to\
  \ tell."
