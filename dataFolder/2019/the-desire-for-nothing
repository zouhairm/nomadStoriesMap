Text: "Seventy-hour weeks, the pressure of deadlines and excel reports and office\
  \ politics\u2014it was sucking me dry. I didn\u2019t have the physical energy to\
  \ work out. I didn\u2019t have the mental energy to\u2026well, do much of anything.\n\
  I had only been at the job for 9 months but it clearly was not a good fit, so I\
  \ spent what spare time I could searching for new jobs. But at that time if you\
  \ asked me what I wanted to do, the truth would have been NOTHING. Anything that\
  \ isn\u2019t work. Does anyone want to pay me to watch Game of Thrones on repeat?\
  \ I\u2019ll throw in a Stranger Things binge session for free. \nThere was only\
  \ one thing that piqued my excitement. But I had a good job that pays well, and\
  \ you can\u2019t jeopardize that for a job that pays less than $800 a month. And\
  \ I have two young nephews that I need to spend time with\u2014after all, I\u2019\
  m their favorite (albeit only) uncle. And I have older parents (sorry M & D) that\
  \ I need to be around, what if something happens to them? I\u2019d never forgive\
  \ myself. And a girlfriend of four years. Jeez, if I\u2019m lucky and she doesn\u2019\
  t break up with me, my best case scenario is\u2026a year of celibacy? In light of\
  \ all that, you can\u2019t possibly go to Spain and teach English for a year, can\
  \ you?\nYes, you can.  Y punto (and that\u2019s that).\nThis is about a leap into\
  \ the unknown, and should end here. There are no guarantees. But since you asked\u2026\
  \nGoing from the office to the classroom has been a breath of fresh air. It\u2019\
  s the closest feeling I\u2019ll probably ever get to being a rock star. Kids falling\
  \ over themselves to give me a hug\u2014literally, a stampede to hug me upon entering\
  \ class led to a nasty fall, which led to a strict no-group-hug policy--austere\
  \ but necessary. In my opinion, the best lessons are the ones that are the most\
  \ fun, which means I incorporate a lot of games, songs, and creativity into the\
  \ classroom to spice things up. Apparently there is room to improve, since a student\
  \ recently showed me a note that said \u201CEnglish is boring, but the teacher rocks.\u201D\
  \ \nIt also doesn\u2019t hurt to live in one of the most charming pueblos in one\
  \ of the most beautiful parts of the world, Southwestern Spain. Or that the rest\
  \ of the teachers at my school are friendly and hysterical (you haven\u2019t lived\
  \ until you\u2019ve seen a group of Spaniards perform \u201CI Want It That Way\u201D\
  .) \nAnd living and communicating in a new language means learning an overwhelming\
  \ number of things each day. It\u2019s like being 5-years-old but with the awe and\
  \ appreciation of a 31-year-old. My colleagues turned friends loved it when, on\
  \ a group trip, I tried to say that I love the town\u2019s cliffs but accidentally\
  \ told everyone I love the town\u2019s asshole.\nThere have, of course, been bumps\
  \ on the road. My apartment was a mess when I arrived, and I lost my cool after\
  \ not having hot water for a month (first time being angry in another language,\
  \ so that\u2019s something). My stomach is still giving me issues which a gentleman\
  \ prefers not to discuss. And of course, long distance relationships with loved\
  \ ones can be difficult. You can\u2019t imagine my FOMO when I learned that my Mom\
  \ and nephew are going to California Pizza Kitchen this week to learn how to make\
  \ homemade pizza.  \nOn the bright side, technology makes it easy to communicate\
  \ in different, and in some ways deeper, ways. I think that the change in my attitude\
  \ has made me a better friend, son, brother, and boyfriend. As a side benefit, I\
  \ no longer want to professionally binge-watch my favorite TV series. And while\
  \ I have no clue what I\u2019m going to do to pay rent when I return to the good\
  \ \u2018ole USA, I\u2019m excited by the options."
