Text: "There's this times you wish you had a camera, or an amazing music peharbs,\
  \ to really describe the feeling you get when you see something. I'm a synesthetic\
  \ person, so I see colours, sounds, and smells when I see everything, and when I\
  \ like it gets with me forever.\nThis story heppened when I was 9, in a small church\
  \ at Trancoso, Bahia - Brazil, me a small child just passing by historical places,\
  \ I love history, since I know myself, and to be in historical sites just make my\
  \ synesthesia pop up like crazy. I got in this small town with my mom and a group\
  \ of people with a guide, didn't know what to expect, lets just remember a child,\
  \ just want to play, but I was curious about the place. \nWell, it was a small village\
  \ and there was this beautiful church in the middle, seems like teletransporting\
  \ to the past, the local people sitting at their doors, talking with each other,\
  \ I just felt like they put me in the bus directly to 1500's, lets not forget that\
  \ this is one of the first cities of the country, and still feels like it has stopped\
  \ in he first years of it's existence.\nEverything was fine, and normal, untill\
  \ we get inside the church, and I wish I can describe how mesmerizing it was, specially\
  \ for a 9 years-old child with a not explainable passion for the past. \nThe walls\
  \ were painted like masterpieces with saints and scenes from the bible, all inspired\
  \ by renaissance painters,  with arabesques in the colour gold,  the acoustica were\
  \ so intense, you could hear your steps in the wood floor, even wearing flip flops.\
  \ The smell of old wood and smoker just added a mystical atmosphere. \nImediatelly\
  \ I got back to the past, it feels like I was there 509 years ago, I felt like part\
  \ of the past and part of the future, I felt one, whole, I started to unsderstand\
  \ the importance of my ancestors, the portuguese culture, the native culture, the\
  \ african culture, everything that create who we are today.\nI left he church still\
  \ feeling like I was in the past, and gets minutes to get back in my own time, but\
  \ the hunger to know better who we were, to study my own history never left. \n\n\
  I guess that's the most amazing thing from trips, you not only know diferent places,and\
  \ cultures, but diferent times as well, and some of this gets with you forever,\
  \ a everlasting learning. \nI still feel the smell of this place, the feeling I\
  \ get when I entered that church, it will stay with me forever."
