Text: "We gathered around the map. Our eyes scanned the coastline of Croatia, searching\u2014\
  for something\u2014but what, we didn\u2019t know. We were in Graz, Austria, at the\
  \ kitchen table of our hostel. There were three of us: Freddy (American), Julian\
  \ (German) and myself. Our trip was coming to a close, but we knew before it ended\
  \ we wanted to camp on a beach. After scouring FlixBus schedules and testing different\
  \ routes, we finally decided Pula, Croatia was our destination. \n\nWith backpacks\
  \ set, and tent in hand we began our journey. We first took a bus to Zagreb, Croatia,\
  \ where we stayed two nights. After our short stop, we caught an early bus to Pula.\
  \ The ride was absolutely treacherous. The air-conditioner had broke, and most passengers\
  \ spent the entirety of the ride finding unique ways to cool down. With sweat-soaked\
  \ shirts and glistening brows, we finally arrived.\n\nWe began the day by looking\
  \ around town and gathering supplies. We grabbed jugs of water and food, then charted\
  \ our path to where we would camp. Our best hope to find a good camping spot was\
  \ to head east toward the water. We grabbed a bus to a small town, Sisan, about\
  \ 8 km east of Pula. The bus stopped, and our adventure truly began.\n\nWith nothing\
  \ but the objective of reaching the water we set off, east, on the road. The heat\
  \ was sweltering and our bags seemed to just keep getting heavier. After walking\
  \ for a while, we reached a gravel part of the road. At that point, we had no idea\
  \ if it was right, or even where it led, but we decided to give it a try. As we\
  \ continued, we saw cars coming the other direction, the passengers in swim suits.\
  \ It gave us the sign that we needed. We trekked on, through the dust and blistering\
  \ sun.\n\nFinally, we reached it\u2026the water. We let our bags, the water jugs,\
  \ the tent, all fall to the ground and we ran for the crystal-blue cove. The water\
  \ was clean and refreshing, and the area was scattered with locals. We had made\
  \ it, but as the sun was setting, the issue became: where do we set up our tent?\n\
  \nWe grabbed our stuff, and continued along the water, searching for a clearing.\
  \ The areas we found were usually filled with trash, forcing us to keep looking.\
  \ Just as the sun was kissing the horizon, we found a spot. We quickly set up our\
  \ tent and whipped out the cooking gear. We brought our propane stove, pan and rice\
  \ to the rocky beach and began to cook.\n\nAs happy as we were to have arrived,\
  \ our beachside spot wasn\u2019t quite paradise. Bugs were swarming, forcing us\
  \ to wrap ourselves in our towels. They kept persisting, forcing us to cut our meal\
  \ prep early, and settle for crunchy rice. We retreated to our tent which wasn\u2019\
  t much better. As we had experienced before, the tent was way too small, and we\
  \ didn\u2019t have blankets or pillows, but this time, as a kicker, it was steamy\
  \ hot as well. \n\nWe tried to sleep, but I couldn\u2019t stand it any longer. I\
  \ left to get some fresh air. I walked down to the beach, and looked up. There,\
  \ floating like an apple in water, was the moon; bright, red and seemingly touchable.\
  \ Unbeknown to us, that night there was a blood moon. I yelled to Freddy and Julian.\
  \ We all sat on the rocks, just staring up at the red monster above us. After a\
  \ while, we returned to the tent and fell right asleep.\n\nIn the morning, we woke\
  \ up and swam in the salty water. With the sun beaming, we spent most of the morning\
  \ floating around. In the afternoon we packed our stuff up and began the journey\
  \ back. We weren\u2019t looking forward to the hike, so we immediately attempted\
  \ to hitchhike. Unlike on our way there, the first car we saw picked us up. It was\
  \ a young french couple and they brought us all the way back to Pula. We stopped\
  \ for beer and pizza and with them, and exchanged stories, preparing for where we\u2019\
  d go next."
