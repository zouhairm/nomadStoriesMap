Text: "The tailwind of a motorbike propels dirt into my eyes. Donkeys and rickshaws\
  \ compete with Careem cars for invisible parking spaces. The dusty facade of Zainab\
  \ Market belies the multilayered labyrinth stretching beyond the first few stalls.\n\
  \nThis city was never meant to be unknown to me. Karachi smells like donuts; like\
  \ the grilled air puffing from the back of an extractor fan. I find this more familiar\
  \ than the visual onslaught. My brother, nose crinkled, puts it more simply: \u2018\
  Sewage.\u2019\n\nDamp with sweat in the still air, we press through crowds of families\
  \ dressed in multi-coloured swathes of cotton. We are approached with friendly persistence\
  \ by a man with row of sunglasses dangling from his left arm.\nI point to my brother\u2019\
  s head. \u2018We already have\u2026\u2019\n\nI consider testing my limited Urdu,\
  \ but my tongue is suddenly too big for my mouth. Years ago, on a New York weekend,\
  \ my father tried to teach me his mother-tongue. I only ended up with mine.\n\n\
  The vendor adopts us anyway, designating himself our personal guide. Unspoken codes\
  \ prevent other salesmen from pilfering us. He ushers us through the overflowing\
  \ wares, subtly steering us toward his friends\u2019 stalls, left arm jangling like\
  \ a wind chime in the ruckus.\n\nThere is no air inside the bazaar. While my brother\
  \ asks where he can find a leather jacket, I am scanning ceiling-high racks of clothing\
  \ for a genuine Pakistani pashmina.\_ Hangers bearing sweaters cheekily emblazoned\
  \ with 'Deisel' and 'Geuss' are swinging in the dull breeze from electric fans.\
  \ There is a brief debate, loud enough to split the hubbub \u2013\_and my brother\u2019\
  s wish is granted.\n\nOur guide leads us swiftly through the maze to a half-enclosed\
  \ room lined with leather. Flies crawl along the underbelly of the overhead striplight.\
  \ The rancid smell of goat is overpowering; the vendors inform my brother it will\
  \ vanish soon enough. Before rupees and jacket are exchanged, before I realise that\
  \ we had left the midday sun far behind us, the room turns black.\n\nThe sound of\
  \ electricity is only noticeable in its absence. There are no generators here; we\
  \ are far from my grandmother\u2019s house in the suburbs. Almost instantly, phone\
  \ screens and torches become a light show. This is an old routine. Haggling resumes.\
  \ It seems louder in the absence of whirring fans. Still, by the time the blackout\
  \ is over, we have grown accustomed to the dark.\n\nThe label on the softest pashmina\
  \ reads Made in Bangladesh. Reluctantly compromising, I ask the women, \u2018How\
  \ much?\u2019\n\nAnother quick debate. I hear the word \u2018gori\u2019 and I know\
  \ they are referring to me. I want to tell them I am not a tourist, though I know\
  \ I\u2019ll be paying tourist prices. Silently, I vow to learn Urdu \u2013 for eavesdropping,\
  \ if nothing else.\n\nThe language follows us out onto Abdullah Haroon Road; the\
  \ sound incomprehensible to me, and yet unnervingly familiar. Like the smell of\
  \ goat lingering on my brother\u2019s jacket days later, my connections to this\
  \ place are intangible. On the balcony in direct sunlight, I can almost see the\
  \ fumes escaping the leather."
