Text: "It all started when the man in front of me swiped the card and wait. After\
  \ a while, he looked at me and said \"accepted\". London was there but most of all\
  \ my first solo trip. I won't say that i wasn't scared and a bit confused but it\xB4\
  s like if everyday i was feeling different, better, after i got my tickets. \nTime\
  \ to organice, read a lot in the web and finally day arrived. I remember myself\
  \ at the airport looking at every gate with the screen informing its destination\
  \ and imagining those people at the queue arriving there. It was a long trip and\
  \ when we landed i though of that picture we had in our english lessons: \"if you\
  \ are tired of London, you are tired of life\". Could i be more anxious? And there\
  \ i was, at Heathrow, looking to those faces, explaining to that guy at migrations\
  \ the reason of my visit, taking my luggage and finding out where to buy and charge\
  \ the Oyster to get to Oxford St. \nEvery step i made i had to be concentrated,\
  \ i was proving myself. After asking some people, Subway stopped at Oxford Station\
  \ and while i was climbing the stairs with my luggage, i started hearing the sound\
  \ of that crowded street full of people, of all nationalities with their own way\
  \ to be and feel. I wanted to cry of my emotion and from there, it was easy to get\
  \ to my hostel. I checked in and didn\xB4t care about my 15 hours journey, i left\
  \ the hostel and went straight to the bus with the help of my dear friend, Google\
  \ Maps. \nI needed to meet the Big Ben, to introduce myself and be known by it.\
  \ From that moment i just wanted to get lost the necessary times and discover something\
  \ new at every corner. Those building, its history, Les Miserables at Picadilly\
  \ or the theatre path next to the Tate, in front of St Paul. \nThat first night,\
  \ when i laid in bed my legs pained so much and i wrote how happy i felt for that\
  \ pain produced for a long walk. \nThe next morning i already had new friends from\
  \ the hostel and kept on discovering London together and the following cities we\
  \ visited. \nIt was 2014 and from that year to this days i couldn't stop planning\
  \ journeys. With friends or by my own i remain or increase that feeling when the\
  \ screen at my laptop says: \"Congratulations, your reservation is confirmed\".\
  \ For some time i though that i travelled so much as a way of scaping from my routine\
  \ but i knew that was what my friends said :). I just travel because i work for\
  \ it, i listen to travelers stories and i read about places and people who experienced\
  \ the same way. I travel because there is a big land to be discovered and nothing\
  \ is repeated in my next destination. There are people over there that i want to\
  \ meet and want to meet me, i can tell. I travel as a way of living and learning\
  \ much more than my city is able to offers me. \nEvery journey ends but i have the\
  \ friends i made and the pictures remained in my Instagram (pabloadad_trips) where\
  \ i upload every trip and describe all i felt in every place. Nowadays i don't care\
  \ that much if someone joins me or not, because my passion for discovering new places\
  \ is all that matters and makes me look forward to writing the website again and\
  \ booking a new ticket for a new adventure."
