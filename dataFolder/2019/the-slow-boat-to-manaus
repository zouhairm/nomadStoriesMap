Text: "Tiny white birds are framed against the dense greens of the rainforest, carelessly\
  \ riding the river breeze. Their only companions on the banks are dug out canoes,\
  \ bobbing in the wake of the slow boat to Manaus. The morning\u2019s murky waters\
  \ twinkle as the sun gains height, unperturbed by the waste that mars western waters.\
  \ \n\nIt rains every day. Twice a day. The dense, damp heat that hangs over the\
  \ water after each rain is punctured by spouts of harsh sun. It\u2019s hot, cold,\
  \ damp, dry, scorching and tepid- you can pass through every climate in an Amazon\
  \ evening. Always, the winds are high and the stars are bright. \n\nFor 3 nights\
  \ and 4 days we lived on the river. Passing cargo ships leave space for travellers,\
  \ mainly locals moving between the remotest villages on the Amazon riverbanks. They\
  \ strap up hundreds of hammocks, across 2 levels. Amongst the bustle of travellers\
  \ setting up their spot for the journey, friends engage in enthusiastic reunions,\
  \ snacks are shared out amongst fellow passengers, small children run wild, swept\
  \ up in excitement, and the same 4 reggaeton songs start their seemingly endless\
  \ loop. Most of the people taking this route are regulars, working and living at\
  \ different spots along the river. Cracking beer cans and settling down for a few\
  \ days of pool and music and relaxation, the boat\u2019s inhabitants are set for\
  \ their journey. \n\nI spent most of my time watching the river. The trees. There\
  \ were plastic chairs available, meaning I could sit and observe weird bugs that\
  \ I saw on the walls for hours at a time. You learn how to kill time, doing absolutely\
  \ nothing. How to disassociate. You can spend 10 minutes staring at some trees,\
  \ check the time and realise you\u2019d actually been there for 2 hours. Once you\
  \ take away all opportunity for electronics, or wifi, or contact with home, you\u2019\
  d be surprised how easily one can be entertained. With my roughly 0 words of Portuguese,\
  \ conversations with the crowds were impassioned on their end and deeply confused\
  \ on mine. \n\nEvery day, we woke at sunrise and slept at sunset. Breakfast was\
  \ served at around 5:30am each day. It was vile. Sickeningly sweet coffee coupled\
  \ with sickeningly sweet American-style white bread. All of this was lapped up with\
  \ what seemed to be a kind of rice pudding, which was, shockingly, sickeningly sweet.\
  \ After the first breakfast I never touched it again. There were beans available\
  \ for lunch and dinner, with the inexplicably ubiquitous farofa mix. Bedtime came\
  \ at 6pm. In the depths of nowhere, days from a city, the views of the milky way\
  \ are only disturbed by whirring birds and bats. \n\nAfter a few days, we all started\
  \ to get pretty disgusting. There were technically showers on the boat, though what\
  \ came out of the spout was around 50% ice water, 50% unidentified insects. I opted\
  \ out. After 4 days, the filth was a struggle. Theft is common, so rooting through\
  \ your bag for fresh clothing is unwise. Our flimsy day clothes clung to our skin\
  \ from the sweat in the air, the heavy humidity hanging over the days. Every pyjama\
  \ top, left to the elements during the day, was crawling in critters by the time\
  \ night fell. Showers were the best thing about Manaus. \n\nThere is almost no other\
  \ situation in life where you would meet the people you meet on the boat. They live\
  \ in villages in the Amazon jungle, taking multi-day cargo boats to work in the\
  \ towns and bring back food for their families. Even with abysmal language skills,\
  \ I had a group on the boat who looked after my belongings, shared their food with\
  \ me, and had long one-sided conversations with me in rapid Portuguese. There was\
  \ one other gringo on the boat, who was equally baffled. \n\nTake the opportunity\
  \ to see corners of the jungle inaccessible to most tourists- watch ecosystems shift\
  \ as rivers converge. Watch pink dolphins race the boat, toucans and parrots settling\
  \ amongst the locals on the broken, plastic chairs. Smell the remotest of Amazonian\
  \ flowers. Sail straight through the end of a rainbow. Embrace incomprehensibility."
