Text: "The majority of school-leaver trips abroad may result in alcohol poisoning\
  \ in Magaluf, clubbing every night in Ibiza or exploring fascinating architecture,\
  \ meeting wonderful people and enjoying the local delicacies in Barcelona. My friend\
  \ and I went for the latter. \n\nWe longed for that short moment where you feel\
  \ on top of the world; taking that first step off the plane and being exposed to\
  \ a lot more heat than us Scots were used to. Despite it turning out that the plane\
  \ door and airport were attached via a walkway, the climate still managed to mock\
  \ our full length trousers and denim jackets through the walls. My friend warned\
  \ me that she would use the phrase \u2018I\u2019m sweating\u2019 a lot throughout\
  \ this holiday. I kept this in mind as we headed to our hotel. We were absolutely\
  \ desperate to change our clothes, but perhaps even more desperate to explore where\
  \ we were. \n\nSo we headed to the beach. My finger only left the shutter on my\
  \ camera when purchasing a sparkly fridge magnet of the city skyline. We sweated\
  \ (at least, my friend did) down the road towards the hotspot.\n\nThen we saw it.\
  \ That haunting message graffitied onto the side of a lamppost. And yet, the message\
  \ was anything but light.\n\n\u2018TOURISTS KILL BARCELONA\u2019.\n\nWho, me? I\
  \ gasped. The further I strolled away from it, the more it was on my mind. Was I\
  \ killing Barcelona?\n\nMaking the decision of which restaurant to eat that night\
  \ was simple. We had to visit the most authentic tapas restaurant we could find.\
  \ And so we went to the one that fitted best in our price range. We asked the waiter\
  \ what he would recommend from the menu so that we could throw ourselves into the\
  \ culture even more. He suggested \u2018Pan a Catalana bread\u2019, it looked like\
  \ a strange mixture of toppings, but tasted like I\u2019d wasted 18 years of my\
  \ life not trying it. With a glass of sangria by the side, we toasted to being the\
  \ tourists who were not killing Barcelona, but celebrating it. \n\nWe presumed the\
  \ metro would be suited to us wannabe-locals. After all, I\u2019d been on the Underground\
  \ a few times; how hard could it be? We purchased some travel cards and headed for\
  \ the platform\u2026but which platform? Google maps had done well getting us this\
  \ far but it held back some crucial information. We had no choice but to ask the\
  \ first trustworthy person we could find. \n\n\u2018It\u2019s the other one,\u2019\
  \ she giggled. \n\nWe had just successfully mastered the metro (is what I wish we\
  \ could have said). On approaching the first stop, we watched very carefully how\
  \ on earth people managed to open the train doors. We held back when it came to\
  \ our stop, hoping that at least one local on our carriage would also be getting\
  \ off at what we thought would be the busiest of them all; old town.\n\nNo one got\
  \ off. Instead, some metro expert offered to open it for us. \n\n\u2018It\u2019\
  s okay, we know what we\u2019re doing, we\u2019re not tourists,\u2019 is what I\
  \ wanted to say.\n\n\u2018Gracius,\u2019 is what my friend said for me. \n\nWe began\
  \ to explore the beauty that was the Gothic Quarter. There was everything from cobbled\
  \ squares to dark alleyways. It was filled with fancy restaurants, bars (most of\
  \ which did not fit in our price range) and a Costa. \n\nAlthough my sweaty friend\
  \ could have done with an ice cold fruit cooler, we decided to eat at a different\
  \ restaurant. The one that had the best (and the only) Pan a Catalana bread I had\
  \ ever tasted. The waiter smiled on our arrival, remembering us from the previous\
  \ night. \n\nYou might even say we were locals."
