Text: "The Phone of the Wind\n\nBy Matt George\n\nThere exists the most extraordinary\
  \ phone booth in Japan.\nIt sits in a serene garden overlooking the Pacific Ocean\
  \ on the outskirts of a town known as Otsuchi. This blue, glass framed phone booth\
  \ holds within it a worn, black, bakelite rotary phone whose cables are neatly coiled\
  \ and attached to absolutely nothing. It never jangles with incoming calls and its\
  \ outgoing calls do not travel through cords and wires. Instead, this phone carries\
  \ within it meditations on life and death. It has become a site of pilgrimage for\
  \ the residents of the Otsuchi who are still busy untangling the grief that remains\
  \ knotted in their stomachs. A grief 7 years old. When in 2011 the Tsunami\u2019\
  s struck and three ocean waves, over twenty high, swirled through their streets\
  \ and found their bedrooms and their playgrounds. \nA centuries old town obliterated\
  \ in an hour. \n\nIn the horror of the aftermath, Itaru Sasaki, still a robust surfer\
  \ at 60 years old, salvaged the corner phone booth and nestled it in a hilltop public\
  \ garden. He then invited the town to step into this phone booth, anytime of day\
  \ or night, to make phone calls to their dead friends and relatives that they had\
  \ lost in the great Tsunami. An opportunity to say all the things to the dead that\
  \ they were never able to finish when their sisters and brothers and mothers and\
  \ fathers and children were still alive. \n\u201CBecause thoughts such as these\
  \ cannot be relayed over a regular phone line\u201D Itaru said to them, \u201CThey\
  \ must be carried on the wind\u201D.\n\nThis phone booth is now known as the Kaze\
  \ No Dewa.\nThe Wind Phone.\nAnd it is now a new type of shrine.\nAnd the pilgrimages\
  \ continue. Because grief is long and hard to carry. It\u2019s heavy and shifting.\
  \ And this phone booth is a place on earth where one might find the privacy to work\
  \ on their pain. A place to wrestle with the tragedy that roiled through their lives.\
  \ And all this was created by the same forces that are distant cousins to all the\
  \ waves that traveling surfers ride. Which is to say also that a surfer in Japan,\
  \ with a solution such as this, will never need common western ideas about anything.\
  \ He will be forever distinct and separate. And the best we can learn from this\
  \ surfer is to allow him to teach us two lessons. That we may laugh at the Japanese\
  \ for being so different, but never forget that they laugh at us for being all the\
  \ same. \nAnd the second lesson? \nNone of us are as smart as we think we are. \n\
