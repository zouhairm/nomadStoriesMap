Text: "I\u2019m a bit of a lone wolf, I like to observe the world around me and contemplate\
  \ the meanings of different people interacting. After a particularly nasty break\
  \ up I decided to spend a few days travelling, to see and do things I never had\
  \ a chance to do so while in a sedentary relationship.\nSo, I decided to travel\
  \ to Italy. I took 2 weeks off work and booked a flight to Milan and spent a wonderful\
  \ week travelling down the West Coast of Italy, stopping at Genoa, a little town\
  \ called Virago, a small town with beautiful empty sandy beaches and gorgeous lemon\
  \ pies. Of course, I stopped in Pisa and visited the leaning tower of Pisa. My journey\
  \ eventually culminated into the climax that is Rome. Even now, almost a year on\
  \ I\u2019m still in awe of the sheer history of that wonderful and strange city.\
  \ \n\nBut it was over too quickly.\n\nAs my week in Italy ended, I knew it was approaching\
  \ the time for me return to Scotland and I knew in my heart I wasn\u2019t ready,\
  \ so I did something I never have done before. I threw caution to the wind and booked\
  \ the cheapest flight out of Rome and so I ended in Budapest Hungary. I had nothing\
  \ booked and it was late when I landed in Budapest, but I was strangely calm. Surrendering\
  \ myself to the whims of fate I trusted myself to find somewhere. And that\u2019\
  s how I found myself in a hostel for the first time in my life.\n\nIt just so happened\
  \ that night was a hostel night out and we were brought around the Burn Bars. I\
  \ made friends with two girls from England who were just back from living in Australia\
  \ for a few years. They were both riveting characters and one confided in me that\
  \ she was working as a prostitute over in Aussie and when I told her of how I used\
  \ to write erotica, we bonded over some silly client requests we\u2019ve had over\
  \ the years. I do remember hearing one comment in the conversation that still resounds\
  \ in my head, \u201CYou\u2019re a writer? I would never have guessed.\u201D \u201C\
  What do you mean?\u201D \u201CWell you\u2019re not totally in love with yourself\
  \ and only talking about yourself.\u201D It was then I made a concerted effort to\
  \ make sure that I would keep on listening to what people had to say so that I would\
  \ always have something to say back to them.\n\nThe two girls were natural wanderers\
  \ and so disappeared into the night before long and I had to start the whole process\
  \ of making that connection with a stranger. But I was lucky again. The hostess\
  \ had taken a liking to me and introduced me to her boss, a fascinating lady from\
  \ the UK who had put Budapest on the traveler's map 10 years ago when she divorced\
  \ her husband back in the UK and set up hostels in the city. We were all in a Burn\u2019\
  s bar and there was Karaoke and this lady asked if I could sing and after hearing\
  \ my Irish accent, she declared that it is God\u2019s gift to hear the Irish sing.\
  \ So, I was drafted up to the stage and made to sing. I sang \u201CThe man who can\u2019\
  t be moved\u201D by The Script and \u201CMy life would suck without you\u201D by\
  \ Kelly Clarkson to standing ovation. I never knew I could sing.\n\nThe next few\
  \ days passed by in a blur as I continued to travel through Europe, I stopped off\
  \ in Berlin, Vienna and at a friend\u2019s request I stopped in Salzburg and was\
  \ pulled onto a tour bus for the Sound of Music tour (a movie I had never seen).\
  \ By the end of it, half of the American middle-aged couples wanted to adopt me.\
  \ It was a strange and bizarre experience but quite fun.\n\nI came home to my flat\
  \ in Glasgow, and I felt strangely tired but satisfied simultaneously. It was such\
  \ a rewarding experience to meet so many new people and to try new things. I might\
  \ be a lone wolf, but I still enjoy being with the pack."
