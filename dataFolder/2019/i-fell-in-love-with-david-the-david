Text: "\u201CAndiamo! Or as you say in the English, let\u2019s go!\u201D said Giuliana,\
  \ as she led us into the crowded room. She had told us about him but this was the\
  \ moment we would see him for the first time. As I walked through the crowd to get\
  \ a closer look, I was struck by his commanding presence and sculpture\u2019s exquisite\
  \ detail \u2013 the laughter lines on his face, the eyes that appeared to look right\
  \ through me, the accentuated leg muscles, the veins protruding from his hands.\n\
  My day began a few hours earlier in Florence\u2019s Piazza San Marco. My friend\
  \ and I were the only Aussies in a motley crew of tourists from more countries than\
  \ an international buffet at the local RSL. We were ready to explore \u201Cthe best\
  \ that Florence has to offer\u201D as the brochure had promised. Giuliana arrived\
  \ looking as fashionable and Italian as I expected. With her Gucci sunglasses propped\
  \ on her head and her Versace scarf twirling in the breeze, she looked like she\
  \ had just stepped off the runway at Milan Fashion Week. She introduced herself\
  \ and announced in accented English that we were about to be transported into the\
  \ Renaissance era.\n\nEverywhere I looked, I saw a building that tried to outdo\
  \ its neighbour in beauty and originality. Arched windows and brown shutters covered\
  \ the side of one building, giving it an old yet regal look. Next door there was\
  \ a tall red building with the most beautiful church-like stained glass windows.\
  \ The ornate etchings, decorations and columns on the walls of a modern store like\
  \ Zara made the franchise look like it had been around since the 1500s. I was in\
  \ awe at how young everything looked despite its age.\n\nWe made our way to the\
  \ Piazza del Duomo where we gazed upon Florence Cathedral, an intimidating yet intricately\
  \ designed church. At approximately 115 metres tall and with a large, recognisable\
  \ dome, it dominates the piazza and shows Florence who\u2019s boss. The fa\xE7ade\
  \ is made of green, white and red marble, which I took as an ode to the Italian\
  \ flag. The walls are crowded with elaborate arches, statues, panels and carvings\
  \ which, Giuliana explained, some of the Florentines thought were a little much.\
  \ This church didn\u2019t appear overnight either - it took 140 years to complete\
  \ the vision created by Arnolfo di Cambio in 1294. \n\nAfter thinking there couldn\u2019\
  t be anything more beautiful, we ventured to Ponte Vecchio, which translates to\
  \ the creatively named \u201COld Bridge\u201D. It was rebuilt in 1345 after the\
  \ original was destroyed by floods. In the early days, merchants such as butchers\
  \ and fishmongers would trade along the arch. These days it was a gold haven with\
  \ jewellers vying for your attention with their best wares.\n\n\u201CNow we go to\
  \ one of the best places to eat in Firenze!\u201D said Giuliana, as she led us to\
  \ an alfresco pizza place full of people enjoying the summer breeze. \u201CIf you\
  \ don\u2019t like-a pizza, you can go over there to have a pasta.\u201D\n\nI opted\
  \ for pizza and didn\u2019t regret it - the Margherita pizza smelt of fresh olive\
  \ oil and peppery basil. As I took a bite, the sweet tomato juices dribbled down\
  \ my chin and the delicate, milky mozzarella created an oozy, stretchy mess. I\u2019\
  d visited \u2018Little Italys\u2019 all over the world but nothing compared to this.\n\
  \nAfter our mouth-watering meal, we had just enough energy to stroll to the Galleria\
  \ dell\u2019Accademia, home to some of the world\u2019s most famous art. The gallery\
  \ was evidently popular as there was a long queue outside. Would we have to wait\
  \ in line? Absolutely not. Giuliana explained that the tour enabled us to skip the\
  \ line. She fleetingly named some of the works housed there, including Giambologna\u2019\
  s Rape Of The Sabines, and then mentioned the pi\xE8ce de r\xE9sistance that we\
  \ were frothing at the mouth to see \u2013 Michelangelo\u2019s David.\n\n\u201C\
  Most people are surprised at how small he is,\u201D she warned. Immediately, I was\
  \ a little disappointed. Wasn\u2019t he supposed to be a mammoth of a sculpture\
  \ considering his reputation?\n\n\u201DBut you decide for yourselves eh?\u201D she\
  \ added and then led us in with a loud and excited \u201CAndiamo!\u201D"
