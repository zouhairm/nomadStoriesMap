Text: "Landing was a moment I couldn\u2019t wait to finish; it took forever. Once\
  \ on the ground I just realised I was there but, there were not feelings able to\
  \ make me see if that moment was one of the uncountable other dreams of landing\
  \ in Paris.\nThe dream came true on a hot and dark Summer night that didn\u2019\
  t let me see the possible and incredible landscape I had always imagined to find\
  \ there. I was really tired after an eleven-hour trip from Brazil to France but,\
  \ my eyes and body wouldn\u2019t relax in order take mental pictures of every inch\
  \ of that place; pictures that nobody will ever erase from where they are.\nFrom\
  \ that previous darkness, some light started showing up and then I could see I was\
  \ approaching somewhere. My heart was out of control. Never had I felt so excited\
  \ before.\nEven more light; more and more but, a special one suddenly made me fix\
  \ my eyes in a specifc direction. The light of the Tower was guiding us into its\
  \ domains. Wow... years waiting for that moment and the Eiffel Tower itself received\
  \ me and invited me to get closer. \nI pinched myself to check if I was dreaming;\
  \ slapped myself stating that men don\u2019t cry. I cried.\nAs a warning, the light\
  \ disappeared. Later I discovered they use to turn it off at 1 a.m.\nOkay, no worries,\
  \ I thought. Let\u2019s hop out the bus and get to the hotel.\nBack in the real\
  \ world I could see an ordinary city and all its problems. Once again I asked myself\
  \ if it was real. I had dreamed of a total different Paris, not that.\nInside the\
  \ Uber car I got many compliments on my French that I had always studied. Then,\
  \ a call that the driver received made me smile and cry even more. I Korean couple\
  \ wanted the other two available seats in the car. Their location? The Tower.\n\
  The tears rolled down and I wasn\u2019t able to make any sound come out. \nThere\
  \ it was. The Eiffel\u2019s creation. In front of me... The Korean couple was lost\
  \ and the driver stopped right in front of the monumet; while there were some attempts\
  \ of communication involving a poor English from the Koreans and a furious French\
  \ from the driver, I was delighted and enjoying that present.\nNow, there was no\
  \ light. I was on fire and it made all be clear and visible.\nIt didn\u2019t matter\
  \ at that point if the light city was off.\nEven with no lights on, I could find\
  \ the beauty of Paris reflected on the expectations I had always had of it.\nOh,\
  \ the couple? The driver? \nForget them! \nEmbrace the moment and imagine that light..."
