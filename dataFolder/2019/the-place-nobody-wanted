Text: "It was a 3 hours journey by boat. I\u2019ve been living in Buenos Aires for\
  \ 8 years, but have never heard about Martin Garcia Island. \nCrossing the bay,\
  \ was impossible not feeling attracted by all those peculiar houses, suspended,\
  \ fearing the power of the river.\nAs the time goes by, the company of small boats\
  \ starts to leave us and suddenly we are navigating through R\xEDo de la Plata,\
  \ getting closer to Martin Garcia Island, which is settled between Argentina and\
  \ Uruguay.\nWhen the boat hits the shore, entering the island is unique. The landscape\
  \ is wild and it feels like the exile, like escaping from an imaginary war. \nOur\
  \ first step after arriving was tasting a local barbecue, which is always appreciated\
  \ by everyone that has the chance to visit these lands of South.\nAfter eating,\
  \ Claudia, our guide, tries to organize the big group, mostly formed by retired\
  \ elderlies, young couples and us, the restless photographers. Following her, we\
  \ found how ancient this place actually is. It was the reason for conflicts between\
  \ Charr\xFAas and Guaranties, even before America had been discovered. And after\
  \ that, things didn\u2019t get any better. It was the place everybody wanted, till\
  \ the 40s, when it was considered a National Park, belonging to Argentina. \nThe\
  \ walking tour is short since the village is small and the populace is 120 people.\
  \ The major point, showed by our guide, was the former prison, now turned into a\
  \ ruin. In this place, the Argentinian ex-president Juan Domingo Per\xF3n got captive\
  \ for about 4 days, in 1945.\nAs January heat consumes us, we keep following Claudia\
  \ and discovering that the island is an open grave of Argentinian history. For a\
  \ while, it was used as a real exile for ex-presidents and another bitten politics.\
  \ Holding a charming bell above the front gate, there is the house where the ex-president\
  \ Arturo Frondizi got arrested for 18 months in 1962. \nAnd, as long as we walk,\
  \ we can see that all the streets are paved.  That is because the island was also\
  \ a type of concentration camp for the exiled. For years, prisoners faced the lowest\
  \ working conditions in a rock quarry. And the parallelepipeds they took from there,\
  \ didn\u2019t only pave the island, but mostly the fancy streets of Buenos Aires.\n\
  When the tour is ended, everyone is allowed to explore the island independently\
  \ till 4 pm, when the only boat gets back to Buenos Aires. Decided to spend the\
  \ night, I and my photography pals choose to meet the aerodrome.\nThere, some light\
  \ airplanes were waiting to take the sky, a great chance for nice pictures and a\
  \ coffee break. The aerodrome is used to receive visitors, mostly from pilot schools\
  \ or some enthusiastic explores, who choose to spend their Saturday evenings eating\
  \ cake and enjoying the local hospitality.\nAfter appreciating the sunset from the\
  \ pier, we spent the night in one of the two hostels of the island. The next day,\
  \ we visited the famous bakery store and \u201CBarrio Chino\u201D, the most antique\
  \ place on the island. There is no maintenance of the old constructions, so the\
  \ vegetation enforced itself and we can see the roots mixing with the walls, creating\
  \ a sort of sad view, between singing birds and white and blue butterflies.\nAfter\
  \ having lunch an excellent fish dish, it was time to prepare ourselves to come\
  \ back to Buenos Aires.\nIn the boat, between complaints about the heat and the\
  \ bugs, people seemed terrified about the possibility of spending more time on the\
  \ island. It mesmerizes me how people can feel repulsed about the idea of being\
  \ with themselves. In my opinion, this place that after 2 days nobody wanted, seemed\
  \ to be the place I really wanted, where I would be able to sit on my desk with\
  \ all windows open and just stay alone and then\u2026 write."
