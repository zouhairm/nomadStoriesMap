Text: "I stood on the slopes of Mount Inari-san, beneath the vermillion gates of Senbon\
  \ Torii, and waved goodbye to my guide. The rain was still spitting, but it\u2019\
  d been pouring all day so that was an improvement. There were puddles on the steps\
  \ and my shoes were soaked through, feet like ice.\n\nThe Fushimi Inari Shrine was\
  \ the final destination on a day-long walking tour of Kyoto. I\u2019ve never been\
  \ one for tours, but this trip to Japan was my first holiday since separating from\
  \ my husband, and by the time I made it to Kyoto, loneliness was starting to bite.\
  \ So I signed up, and spent a day with Maki-san, a knowledgeable guide, and a gorgeous\
  \ French woman who said she was jet lagged but looked fresher than me. From the\
  \ Golden Pavilion to the Nishiki Market, our small group explored this ancient yet\
  \ modern city, our enjoyment undampened by the cool autumnal rain.\n\nAnd then night\
  \ fell while we were climbing Inari-san, and we went our separate ways, and I was\
  \ by myself again.\n\nI hesitated, unsure whether to keep climbing in the dark.\
  \ The stairway was steep and framed by thousands of torii gates, built so close\
  \ together they created a kind of tunnel. Each one was a square wooden arch, painted\
  \ vibrant red, donated by businesses hoping for good luck. But they were also supposed\
  \ to be gateways between the mundane and the spirit world.\n\nHow I longed to cross\
  \ that boundary, to leave my old life \u2014 with its heartbreak and its isolation\
  \ and its starting again \u2014 behind. I could believe that was possible in the\
  \ darkness, the way hanging lanterns cast hatched, red-tinged shadows across the\
  \ path. If I just kept going, what worlds would I discover?\n\nSo I climbed.\n\n\
  There were more tourists on the stairs than I expected for a cold, damp evening.\
  \ The way they pushed past me made me feel invisible. But they thinned out the higher\
  \ I went. When I came to a nondescript intersection with a toilet block, I paused.\
  \ Climbing Inari-san can take two to three hours, and I was hungry, lonely, and\
  \ starting to shiver in my soggy clothes. I\u2019d never felt more profoundly mundane.\n\
  \nMaybe I was asking too much from the torii gates? Even if I crossed their invisible\
  \ line, how would I know?\n\nI gave up my quest at that intersection, and headed\
  \ back down the mountain. As the crowds returned, I resigned myself to being invisible\
  \ again. So I was surprised when a tall figure, bounding up the stairs two at a\
  \ time, stopped right in my path. \n\n\u2018Hello again, old young lady,\u2019 he\
  \ said, in a deep voice with an American accent. He was young, his skin so dark\
  \ he would have blended into the night if it wasn\u2019t for a grey hoodie.\n\n\
  When I didn\u2019t answer, he leaned close. \u2018Oh, I see.\u2019 His eyes danced\
  \ in the lamplight and there was something kind in them. \u2018You don\u2019t know\
  \ me yet.\u2019\n\nI knew I should feel weirded out, even threatened, but I didn\u2019\
  t. I just held his gaze.\n\nHe smiled. \u2018See you soon, old young lady.\u2019\
  \n\nThen a group of tourists washed around us like the tide coming in, and swept\
  \ him away.\n\nI stood in the hatched lamplight and red shadows for a long time,\
  \ staring the way he had gone. Around me, the mountain with its tourists and its\
  \ puddles was still the same and yet, why did I feel like something had changed?\n\
  \nWhen you cross an invisible line, from the mundane to the spiritual, between the\
  \ past and the future, the old you and the new you, how do you even know? Would\
  \ there be a sign?\n\nEventually I got my legs working again, and emerged from the\
  \ torii gates to the main shrine. The world felt strange as I walked to the train\
  \ station. I was still a lone, suddenly-single woman in a country \u2014 in a world\
  \ \u2014 that buzzed with people. But Kyoto, damp and fluorescent, was alive in\
  \ a way I hadn\u2019t noticed before. Its crowds had become a heartbeat. And smiling,\
  \ feeling welcome, I joined the throng."
