Text: "I had dreamed about it for many years. Going to Iceland seemed to me like a\
  \ taste of utopia, but it ended up beign far better than that. \nThe second I set\
  \ foot on Icelandic soil, I found myself stuck in the middle of a mattress of snow\
  \ covering a small city with simple architecture and little noise. I knew beforehand\
  \ that Reykjavik was small and with a casual atmosphere, but never had I imagined\
  \ how lovely every corner of it could be. \nI could play snowball fights virtually\
  \ anywhere, go to the supermarket wearing pijamas and socialize with any random\
  \ stranger on the streets without a judging eye staring at me with disgust. On the\
  \ contrary, Iceland's inhabitants were at all times really warm, welcoming and open\
  \ to socialize. Not only were people nice on the streets, but also in bars. I was\
  \ at the smoking area at Dillon Bar when this friendly man came, introduced himself\
  \ and shook hands with me, starting a casual conversation and ending up at my table,\
  \ toasting, sharing life stories and having an amazing time. the same situation\
  \ occurred more than ten times in the three hours I spent there, and at all moments\
  \ people were open to share drinks, laughs, and have a good time.\nApart from its\
  \ people, Iceland also took me by surprise with its magnificent landscapes. I toured\
  \ around the National Park, which was covered by snow and scarcely populated. Across\
  \ the Golden Circle, I had the opportunity to indulge myself with the view of breath-takingly\
  \ beautiful cliffs, apart from the mesmerizing Gullfoss waterfall, which was partially\
  \ frozen and surrounded by the coldest wind I have ever felt. Additionally, a walk\
  \ around the geysers proved an inspiring, almost surreal experience, with its sulfuric\
  \ scent and the fury of its eruptions. Finally, the greatest highlight of the whole\
  \ experience: seeing the Northern Lights at midnight in the National Park. It was\
  \ about 11 pm and the light would not appear in the sky. Yet, I was delighted with\
  \ the clean view of the constelations and the deep black of the sky. Suddenly, a\
  \ white strike shimmered in the sky and the next thing I knew was they were there:\
  \ the Northern Lights started dancing in the sky with superb magnetism that provoked\
  \ tears of joy, of amusement and a smile that will remain eternally every time I\
  \ remember that hour of witnessing the most amazing natural phenomenon that my eyes\
  \ have ever perceived. \nAll in all, my dream of visiting Iceland came true and\
  \ proved my expectations low. Reality brought to me adorable people with open minds\
  \ and friendly attitudes, apart from the most moving sceneries I have ever found\
  \ in nature. With such a combination, and also including the simplicity of the lifestyle\
  \ and the calm which characterizes it, Iceland proved unmeasurably better than what\
  \ I had ever expected or imagined in my dreams. Even though I had only four days\
  \ to experience it in winter, I am pretty sure that summer there, with the intensity\
  \ of green everywhere, must be equally (or perhaps even more) inpiring."
