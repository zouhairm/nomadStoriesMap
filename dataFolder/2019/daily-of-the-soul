Text: "November 20,2012. I woke up in the middle of the night, hyperventilating and\
  \ a racing heart. I looked around, I was in my bedroom same bedroom since 7 years\
  \ ago, but it felt different. I was confused, flashback images from the night before\
  \ at my dad\u2019s funeral, keep playing in my head. I laid down, looked at the\
  \ ceiling and tried to calm my self. \n\nSuddenly my arms and legs were numb, my\
  \ head was heavy, I couldn\u2019t move and I started to sink into the bed. I couldn\u2019\
  t scream, I couldn\u2019t move. I heard my dad whispering  \u201Cmove, do not stay,\
  \ do not settle, reinvent yourself and give yourself to the world in the way the\
  \ world has been given to you.\u201D \n\nThe sunlight poured through the window\
  \ and into my eyes, I could hearmy dogs barking, I opened my eyes, something inside\
  \ had change. I called my mom, I told her I was going on a trip, I packed what was\
  \ necessary, loaded my car to ready my self for a solo adventure for the month to\
  \ come. Ready to meet people, collecting stories and writing screenplays. On the\
  \ trip I found a group that invited me to San Francisco for New Year\u2019s eve.\
  \ The following summer I traveled with my sister to Saudi Arabia, the Emirates and\
  \ Turkey. Eventually I visited different places in America, Europe, Africa and Asia.\
  \ I found a partner who loves traveling and I completely fell in love. After some\
  \ years of the adventure together we decide to split apart and take different routes\
  \ in life. I traveled more to heal, to put myself together, to learn something new\
  \ everyday, to create the best version of myself.\n\nTravel became a need and my\
  \ life change to work  hard for periods of time to save money, create independent\
  \ films that allow me to tell stories and travel around to keep finding stories\
  \ worth to tell. \n\nWhile more I travel the most I learn about the world, nature,\
  \ cultures, people and though all this I know more about myself and what I\u2019\
  m capable to do. Which I think is fascinating. Every trip, every project, everyday,\
  \ it\u2019s an opportunity for a new adventure."
