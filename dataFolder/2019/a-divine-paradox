Text: "On the train from Vilanova i la Geltr\xFA to Passeig de Gr\xE0cia, on the first\
  \ leg of our journey to la Sagrada Fam\xEDlia, I open at the dog-eared page in the\
  \ book I\u2019m reading, The Secret Scripture.\n\nSebastian Barry\u2019s lush prose\
  \ pulls me in and, word-by-word, I sink deeper into the world of 100-year-old Roseanne\
  \ McNulty. In the book, the elderly care home resident recalls her turbulent upbringing\
  \ in rural Ireland during the troubles of the 1920s with a religious society of\
  \ secrecy, exploitation, and hypocrisy bled through every page.\n\nThe thick bubble\
  \ around me, rendering inaudible the buzz of nearby conversations and the clatter\
  \ of wheels on the tracks under my feet, bursts as golden light fills the carriage.\
  \ A brief break in the rugged mountains hugging the coastline, too brief for me\
  \ to pull out my phone to get a good Boomerang, unveils the rising sunlight cascading\
  \ on the Mediterranean sea.\n\nFrom the train window, I can see the trickles of\
  \ sunlight reflecting on the teal water and dancing with the movement of the sea\
  \ like fish scales. \n\nAs the foaming waves ripple on the sandy beach below, the\
  \ theme of the day seems to be liminal spaces. Fiction to reality; shore to sea;\
  \ common ground to holy place.\n\n*\n\nVenturing inside, all-too-aware of being\
  \ an atheist in the house of God, I hush my voice and step carefully like I\u2019\
  m walking on glass. The inside of Antoni Gaud\xED\u2019s unfinished masterpiece\
  \ is staggering. With Gothic architecture, Art Nouveau, and geometric design blended\
  \ together like the marbling of paint, it\u2019s clear that every detail of la Sagrada\
  \ Fam\xEDlia has been painstakingly designed and crafted to epitomize beauty. \n\
  \nKaleidoscopic stained glass windows touch floor-to-ceiling, sculptures adorn the\
  \ walls, and, above my head, it looks like the night sky is floating beneath the\
  \ ceiling. The pillars inside, towering to the heavens, weave into a strange network\
  \ of veins, arteries, and smooth muscle like we are walking around inside breathing\
  \ lungs.\n\nIn the quiet area of pews in the middle of the room, I can see worshippers\
  \ lowering down onto kneelers to pray. One woman, in the front row, is shaking and\
  \ nodding her head with passion, like she is indeed conversing with the Almighty,\
  \ as tears spill down her cheeks.\n\nThe grandeur of the Roman Catholic bas\xED\
  lica is, however, somewhat dwarfed by the memory of only a half hour before. My\
  \ boyfriend and I had taken our obligatory tourist selfies by the green pond outside\
  \ the church and we sat at an outdoor bar until our time slot to go inside. With\
  \ beer and ice cream in hand, we dissected the church\u2019s fine details glistening\
  \ in the sun like clusters of spun brown sugar when a homeless woman approached\
  \ our table. In Catalan, she asked us for money and gestured to her mouth to show\
  \ her hunger. \n\nThe overwhelming majesty of la Sagrada Fam\xEDlia goes some way\
  \ to numb us to the social issues spanning the city, and the world, beyond these\
  \ expertly carved walls. But the paradox between the estimated 3,000 homeless people\
  \ in Barcelona, many of whom beg on the street and approach strangers for money,\
  \ and the erection of such a luxurious, monumental church, still under construction\
  \ 137 years after work began in 1882, cannot be ignored.\n\nWe step back out into\
  \ the Barcelona sun and I wonder how believers feel when they leave. Do they feel\
  \ cleansed of sin, glowing with a warm feeling of love and renewed spirituality?\
  \ I can only guess. I have never felt, and have on occasion almost been jealous\
  \ of those who do feel, the blind faith, unwavering devotion, and solace many people\
  \ take from practicing religion. \n\nAs we toddle along the street to a nearby souvenir\
  \ shop, squinting our eyes in the new light, I am glad I visited. La Sagrada Fam\xED\
  lia is a breathtaking architectural marvel like no other, yet I still feel conflicted,\
  \ almost guilty for gawking at its beauty.\n\nIf He exists, are the worshippers\
  \ kneeling in the pews, praying to a lavish sculpture of their savior on the cross\
  \ under a baldachin, somehow closer to God than someone praying on the ground in\
  \ the street outside?"
