Text: "A deep faint bang could be heard from the door but no one bothered to get up\
  \ and check the door. Presumably, everyone was in a deep sleep as I was. The only\
  \ thing that finally woke us all up was the alarm that annoyingly went off at exactly\
  \ 5am. \u201CThis sssucks,\u201D I stutter under my breath, so no one could hear\
  \ me because this was supposed to be a happy time with the whole family.\n\nThe\
  \ night before, we had arrived at the famous Caribbean Bay Resort to spend a sleepover.\
  \ One night at this heavenly resort had been one of the \u201Cbest nights out\u201D\
  \ with my entire family. I recall having a scrumptious meal under the night sky\
  \ with glimmering stars that make you wish you could see beyond the universe. Everyone\
  \ was very kind, I even got into a conversation with one of the chefs and complimented\
  \ his splendid meal, \u201CYou deserve some accolades chef.\u201D It is funny how\
  \ we bonded over a single meal, and talked as if we had known each other since the\
  \ beginning of life. Unfortunately, the night did not last forever.\n\n\u201CPut\
  \ on something warm, it\u2019s going to be cold for a while,\u201D my mother advised\
  \ us. I had shared the room with my two elder brothers that evening.\nWe were en\
  \ route to Zambia, were we currently lived, from Zimbabwe and the whole family had\
  \ decided to spend a night in Kariba. It was a convenient place, because of its\
  \ geographical location which serves as a border town between Zambia and Zimbabwe.\
  \ With outstanding monuments and safari drives to keep tourist engaged in various\
  \ activities.\n\nA tour van parked outside, at dawn. The night sky was just starting\
  \ to get invaded by the glorious morning sunrise. \u201CIf one has the perfect viewpoint\
  \ of the sunrise into the horizon, what more would they ask for.\u201D \n\nBefore\
  \ embarking on our safari adventure into the wild, I still found it very unfair\
  \ how my dad was not coming along. Well, he did have the privilege to get more sleep,\
  \ after all he was the only driver we had for the rest of the trip across the Zambian\
  \ border. \n\nThe marvelous scenes that I experienced 30 minutes after whining about\
  \ the sudden early morning adventure voyage shall forever be cherished. I indulged\
  \ every moment of it and felt as if I was \u201Cone\u201D with the animal kingdom.\n\
  \nThe tour guide drove about 45 minutes to the sight that had been scheduled that\
  \ morning, whilst he drove he shared so many local stories with us, about the wild\
  \ animals and the village people, he clearly described every aspect of the story\
  \ so well, and I felt like I belonged. I always pictured about \u201Cwhat I could\
  \ have done\u201D if I got caught up on the same situations the tour guide shared\
  \ with us.  \n\n\u201CSometimes the elephants pass through this village early in\
  \ the morning, leaving trails and footprints. The villagers often complain about\
  \ their markets being demolished in the process.\u201D\n\n\u201CDo lions also come\
  \ around? Do hyenas also travel in packs? \u201D My stunned soul, would bombard\
  \ the tour guide with more questions.\n\u201CI thought you\u2019d ask that young\
  \ man. They do and they usually cause threats to the community but it is our job\
  \ to keep everyone safe, including the animals because this was once their home.\u201D\
  \ \n\nWe got off the main road and headed down into the interior, the dry grass\
  \ closed upon us, stalky brush and deadwood, we finally appeared at the end of the\
  \ road and it seemed there was a different world on this side of the bush, it was\
  \ an ideal \u201Canimal kingdom\u201D and it was strikingly beautiful that I could\
  \ hardly believe it was real.\n\nAt this very moment, I felt as if I was one with\
  \ the world. I felt so complete in every possible way I could ever imagine and there\
  \ was nothing else that could take away my satisfaction. \n\nThis was one of the\
  \ most scenic routes and I would not hesitate twice to revisit Kariba. Especially\
  \ after my heart felt trapped to the place."
