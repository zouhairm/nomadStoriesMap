Text: "Sunday the 24th of Jan 2010 was the auspicious day, for me and my friends were\
  \ all set to be a part of the great treasure hunt [read census] of the big cats\
  \ held at Nagarahole. We reached the camp with mixed emotions, curiosity, excitement,\
  \ and fear being the most predominant ones. This was the first of its kind for us\
  \ and not to forget that we had to sign an agreement which stated that we would\
  \ be solely responsible for any catastrophic disaster (exaggeration much) that might\
  \ befall us. All the 10 volunteers were divided into 5 groups of 2 volunteers each\
  \ (a simple math you can do too), along with a gunman and a guide each for the 4-day\
  \ adventure.\nSome days it was a small trek of about 5 KM, while a couple of days\
  \ seemed to be strategically planned by a foe to test our brawn alone.\nBeing a\
  \ part of this census was a proud feeling for me, so naturally the whole world knew\
  \ I was a part of it. So when I got back, a lot of people asked me \u201CSo how\
  \ many tigers did you count?\u201D It was not a Hi-tea party I went to, where all\
  \ the members of the striped clan were invited and the census figures were simply\
  \ proportional to the members present at that party. And if your count exceeded\
  \ ours then it simply means that we conveniently excluded and dismissed those tigers\
  \ that spoke about deforestation or poaching. Our census included not counting tiger\
  \ heads but noting down pug marks, sightings, droppings (yes that counts too!) of\
  \ herbivore and carnivore animals.\nWhile sighting a tiger or any other wild animal\
  \ while on foot was the hidden motive for us, the inhabitants weren\u2019t a bit\
  \ cooperative towards our desires. Nonetheless there were many other experiences\
  \ that every mortal we come across will hear about. One such experience was during\
  \ our second day of trekking. It was just another day which found us gathered around\
  \ the ranger\u2019s office at 5 AM waiting for the guides so we could head straight\
  \ into the wild, hoping the second day won\u2019t be as quiet as the first. But,\
  \ in a jungle it\u2019s all about luck. A common saying in the jungle is that for\
  \ every big cat we see four would have seen us! \nUpon hearing alarm calls given\
  \ out by deer, we paused for a couple of minutes.  As luck would have it, we heard\
  \ a tiger snarl!  Slowly, we moved in its direction to realize that it was an epic\
  \ struggle between a bison and a tiger. One struggling for its life and the other\
  \ for its food.  All excited, we went closer standing just a few feet away from\
  \ the scene with just a layer of lantana standing between the two-legged and the\
  \ four-legged.  We heard a blood-chilling roar from the tiger and a painful call\
  \ from the bison and then prevailed absolute silence.  A couple of minutes later,\
  \ the guards slowly entered inside the lantana coverings. We had only seen such\
  \ a battle on television, and your sibling trying to snatch the remote being the\
  \ only being, to possibly cause you any harm. We were engulfed in a strange sense\
  \ of fear and anxiety about the fate of the bison. As our guards carefully walked\
  \ ahead with their guns, the tiger which had sensed human presence had decided to\
  \ make away from the scene. We slowly walked in to witness a sad sight of a very\
  \ huge female bison just killed! There were deep claw marks and clear signs of bite\
  \ wounds on the neck.  Not wanting to disturb further, we left the spot pitying\
  \ the bison and feeling extremely lucky for having witnessed a firsthand kill. We\
  \ reached our base camp with an amazing experience to narrate. \nTigers are our\
  \ national pride,\nWe kill them for their hide,\nWe are needy, we are greedy,\n\
  We do not heed to their plead,\nLeave behind our creed,\nOf killing tigers to feed\n\
  It is our duty to protect their lives,\nSo let them live,\nLet them breed and let\
  \ us stop bleeding\nthe country dry of tigers."
