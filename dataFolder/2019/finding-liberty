Text: "At one point, being restricted from entering almost all countries was the ordinary\
  \ reality of my life. It all changed when I was resettled by the UNCHR in Nashville,\
  \ Tennessee years ago. The chances for a refugee to be resettled to a new country\
  \ are as little as 1% sometimes. I was one of the extremely lucky ones. In addition\
  \ to a new safe home, my pending dreams were turned to goals instead. I always wanted\
  \ to travel the world, and with a simple state issued ID, New York was closer than\
  \ ever. I couldn\u2019t think of a better way to claim my newly acquired freedom.\
  \ \n     New York during the fall film festival was as I expected, hectic and unapologetically\
  \ diverse. I knew my task was rather impossible from day one with four days and\
  \ a limited credit card. My Airbnb reservation was at the city of Astoria in Queens.\
  \ While Astoria is famous for its Greek restaurants and delicious foods, I was mostly\
  \ content because my place was an awesome find! It proved that you might hit the\
  \ jackpot with some serious research. The town itself was not aesthetically impressive\
  \ compared to more NYC-like neighborhoods in Manhattan. It had this sense of practicality\
  \ in its architecture and small single-family houses. I didn\u2019t pay much attention\
  \ to the drastic difference since I prefer immersing myself in any traveling experience.\
  \ The fifteen minutes trip to Manhattan felt like a rite of passage. I understood\
  \ why commuters looked cranky and unwilling to acknowledge anything but their smartphones.\
  \ \n     Staying outside Manhattan wasn\u2019t all cons since I found this amazing\
  \ Turkish restaurant near Astoria\u2019s Ditmars Blvd station. \"TRUVA Cafe & Grill\"\
  \ instantly became my nightly spot after a long day at the city. I would sit at\
  \ this small table and have a huge Turkish teapot while listening to a collective\
  \ of many languages from Arabic, to Indian and Albanian. It\u2019s a refreshing\
  \ sensation to identify with the locals, and no longer be the odd person in the\
  \ group. I would stay in Astoria again just to sit for another two hours breakfast\
  \ at the \u201CFamily Corner\u201D breakfast diner. I also raved about this amazing\
  \ pastry place called \u201CMartha's Country Bakery\u201D. No wonder it had a fifteen\
  \ minutes stay limit as customers were pouring in nonstop. Foodies like me will\
  \ appreciate the smell of freshly brewed coffee in the morning along any of their\
  \ wide selections of deserts.  Can one eat six meals a day? Food in New York suddenly\
  \ became my medium of recognizing the multicultural side of the town. Dining out\
  \ in New York should be marked as a sacred ritual. I\u2019m also enormously jealous,\
  \ not many people have access to authentic international cuisines a few minutes\
  \ away from their homes.  Food in NY was my way of becoming familiar with its people\
  \ and appreciating their uniqueness. \n     Regardless of how you choose to explore\
  \ and navigate this city; it still has so much to offer for all tastes. Tourists\u2019\
  \ attractions vary to the degree of becoming overwhelming. New Yorkers are very\
  \ fast based like their city; imagine walking while others are almost jogging! While\
  \ this destination is not for everyone, it still deserves the credit for being a\
  \ true gem. I sat on this remote bench at the vast and spectacular Central Park,\
  \ the weather felt cold although it was early in October, yet I was warmed by gratitude.\
  \ I saw what others loved about this city beyond the billboards at Time\u2019s Square.\
  \ New Yorkers realize the notion that anything is possible if enough effort and\
  \ hard work are invested. I was inspired by this realistic yet magical view of life\
  \ evident in the majority of the places I visited. The realization that I could\
  \ join this crowd by choosing to live deliberately had left me with a serene feeling.\
  \ I finally arrived at a place that welcomed strangers like me over the decades.\
  \ The journey that led me wasn\u2019t a mere coincidence. It's the real essence\
  \ of America. As if I needed another testament, I ended my trip with a sailing trip\
  \ to Ellis Island. A closer view of the statue of liberty cannot be missed."
