Text: 'At one time when we were planning a vacation, we found a travel ticket to Singapore.
  It was still clear that this was my first vacation experience abroad. The city is
  not too big with a beautiful view of the plane before we land. Buildings and houses
  neatly arranged compared to buildings in my city. So many things I saw starting
  from the culture and atmosphere of the city that reminded me like in the mountains
  or villages. I wanted to invite my parents to vacation here, but unfortunately I
  wasn''t given that opportunity. In this place I study and see different cultures
  from my country. At night we walked along Orchard Road, Singaporeans who liked to
  walk quickly indicated they did not like to linger. When in a red light, without
  being told the passing vehicle will stop and let people pass. This culture may have
  become a good habit. I also see public vehicles in various places with the rules.
  I have heard that Singapore is a clean place, proven when everywhere I don''t see
  rubbish. Also when riding public vehicles may not bring food or drinks. Not to mention
  CCTV in all public places. At noon we took a walk to Sentosa Island, we took the
  tram. Again  I see an orderly culture when going up and down, putting people out
  before entering. It''s an interesting experience to take home and told an acquaintance
  or relative.

  I really like traveling, because I can share experiences, culture, language, and
  get to know people around. I also like photography and I hope that one day I will
  be given another chance and be able to travel around the world and tell the beauty
  and various portraits recorded in my photo.'
