Text: "We came to Korea completely unprepared. We didn't have any plans and routes,\
  \ to be honest, even we didn't know much about the country. Sometimes nice and helpful\
  \ to dilute the carefully planned spontaneous travel. In the visited Seoul: Namsan\
  \ Tower and Namsan Park, Gyeongbokgung Palace, Hongdae street (shops and street\
  \ musicians and singers), Olympic Park (can rent a free Bicycle through the app\
  \ \"OBike\" and go there), Hengshan Park (just walk, not to ride, checked, ahaha),\
  \ shopping complex, Coex (shopping and walking), the temple COGECA (small but interesting),\
  \ bongeunsa temple, Myeongdong (good and cheap shopping).\n What I liked?\n\n+ Good\
  \ safe and modern subway\n\n+ Toilets at every step (and in the subway at every\
  \ station at the exit)\n\n+ Good attitude to foreigners (we have repeatedly helped\
  \ to find a particular place)\n\n+ Service at a good level (hotels, restaurants,\
  \ shops)\n\n+ Enough to have an initial level of English (I advise you to learn\
  \ a basic set of words for communication)\n\n+ Nice warm weather ( from + 23 to\
  \ + 27 in September when we went)\n\n+ Security (Korea is considered one of the\
  \ safest countries due to the large number of cameras in the cities)\n\n+ Wifi everywhere\
  \ ( but my phone apparently is not so good to catch everything).\nThe trip left\
  \ a good impression about this country."
