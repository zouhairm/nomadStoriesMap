Text: "I dived my hand through the inside sleeve of my backpack, searching for my\
  \ passport. As my fingertips brushed the navy-blue cover, I released my breath.\
  \ It was a miracle they hadn\u2019t slipped it away from me. With my passport tightly\
  \ clasped between my hand and my chest, there wasn\u2019t a chance I was letting\
  \ it out of my sight after the events of the past 24 hours. No longer within the\
  \ sheltered bubble of resort life and my vacation job that I was forced to flee\
  \ from. I now walked the tattered streets of Cairo, crowded with locals celebrating\
  \ the end of Ramadan month. \nSeventeen-year-old Australian female, vulnerable and\
  \ alone. My future was unclear and my safety net had diminished the moment I bought\
  \ that one way bus ticket into the unknown. \n\n\u201CNonsense you\u2019re in Egypt\
  \ now!\u201D \n\nMy new companion graciously shrugged as he handed the money over\
  \ to the bus driver to compensate for my exceeded luggage amount.\nI had only met\
  \ him five minutes earlier and he was refusing to let me pay him back.\nSwallowing\
  \ the lump in my throat, I repeated \u201CShookrun Katear\u201D (Thank you so much)\
  \ for as many times as he\u2019d allow me to. \n\nThe crescent moon hung in the\
  \ air just between the highest point of the mosque and my destination, the night\
  \ air hugged me as I walked towards the square. Pushing my sleeves a little further\
  \ up my arms, I looked up again, and there it was, the sight I had come to see.\
  \ \nKhan El Khalil\u2019s aura was unmistakable. My eyes frantically darted from\
  \ each market stall, to the dozens of cobbled medieval buildings within the square,\
  \ frightened that I would blink and miss a glance. \nThe sounds of traders making\
  \ deals and working in their wares grew louder as I drew closer, the myriad of colorful\
  \ lights swath the alleyways and stalls.\nHundreds of faces reflected on the colored\
  \ ornaments, I couldn\u2019t help but dream of a house of my own decorated with\
  \ those treasures. \nAs I wondered through the magic that was Khan El Khalil, I\
  \ learned that the buildings were hundreds of years old and stores had been passed\
  \ down families from generation to generation. \n\nThe heavy stares from what felt\
  \ like everyone were undeniable, I drew plenty of attention probably because I hadn\u2019\
  t spotted a single other westerner in the area that night. \nI took a deep breath\
  \ and relaxed myself into conversation with the admiring locals. Generosity poured\
  \ from them through their actions and complimenting words. They seeked nothing in\
  \ return and believe me, I insisted on returning. \nHowever, I was met with a slap\
  \ on the hand by a gentle faced lady, when reaching towards my purse in attempt\
  \ to repay her. \nFrom gifts, to tours, to affection, to food and drink. I was left\
  \ with a content stomach and a bag filled with gifts, without spending a single\
  \ pound. \nMy new friend, a store owner took my hand and swept me through the Souk,\
  \ engulfed by sudden scents of cinnamon, cumin, spice and saffron, laced with gurgling\
  \ shisha smoke and spicy Turkish coffee.\n\n\nFestivities continued on until the\
  \ morning light and I embraced every moment, joy radiated from every individual\
  \ and contagiously latched onto me. I danced through the crowds and parted ways\
  \ with many. Translucent waves stung my eyes the entire night and, in the end, my\
  \ heart was full to the brim. \nI experienced God through everyone I had crossed\
  \ paths with. \nI was shown so much hospitality and kindness in a nation so undeserving\
  \ of the stigma that has been placed on it, growing up in Australia. We were interconnected,\
  \ the people and I, regardless of the obvious religious and cultural differences,\
  \ I was welcomed. \nAs comfortably as the petite Arab woman welcomed me, a stranger\
  \ into her home. I welcomed the anticipated unknown. Would I run out of money and\
  \ be stuck in Egypt? Or would I make a way to stay? I didn\u2019t know. But that\
  \ was no longer on the forefront of my mind. The bustling streets of the megacity\
  \ that is Cairo, had captivated my full attention."
