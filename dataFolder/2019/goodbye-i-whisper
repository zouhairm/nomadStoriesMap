Text: "I didn\u2019t expect to find myself, while walking across the Oberbaum Bridge.\
  \ My heavy heart pounds in the dazzle of the sun. The music playing nearby flows\
  \ into my ears, passing me like a cloud of smoke. I can feel the melody seep deep\
  \ into my pours and it makes me tingle from the inside out. The noise from the street;\
  \ the construction, passing cars, the tremor of the train tracks, the pluck of guitar\
  \ strings, laughter, cries, the wind\u2019s gentle talk!    \n\nA song, of a boat\
  \ in the middle of the ocean; no engine; just the wind to move it along. The language\
  \ is different to that of mine, but I understand the meaning of the artist; what\
  \ he wants to portray. The idea, to go with the flow of the waves and you'll eventually\
  \ end up where the world wants you to be, \"sei frei\"! The chords are beautiful,\
  \ with a tinge of melancholy, almost mirroring my feelings awaiting my immanent\
  \ departure. I look around at the bustling surroundings, a tall handsome man in\
  \ red patent stilettos, which elongate his muscular legs. I inhale a familiar smell,\
  \ I smile over my right shoulder remembering my first perfume as a teenager. A chic\
  \ looking, woman, runs across the street, ignoring the swearing cyclist and the\
  \ beeping horns from a front line of hankering cars. She skips onto the pavement\
  \ and lifts a little boy onto her hip. She kisses a bohemian looking man, in baggy\
  \ shorts and Birkenstock sandles. I watch as this visionary family sway down the\
  \ street in domestic bliss.  \n\nMy attention is brought to the rays from the sun,\
  \ shining on my arms. The tiny hairs are illuminating gold, my veins the warmest\
  \ blue, my heart, dreamy, for this city, which embraces me as if I were a monumental\
  \ statue. I desperately want to capture the intensity of the last moments, soak\
  \ up this wonderful feeling inside, but the fear creeps in and the shy tick-tock\
  \ of my watch brings me back to my anxious reality. Once again, I am reminded I\
  \ must return, yet conflicted with the thought that I belong here, plopped deep\
  \ into the history of the city that I have such desire to be a part of. The old\
  \ meets the new here, the differences go hand in hand, each entity accepting the\
  \ other.  My soul is alive with the surrounding activity. I crave the motion of\
  \ such big cities but also the nonchalant persona that Berlin brings.   \n\nI was\
  \ lost before I ran away. I was hungry before I was fed this culture, I was a stranger,\
  \ before I found myself. I won\u2019t recognize her when I return from where I came.\
  \ Now, far from home yet, I have never felt more loved, more connected, more grown.\
  \ They say you fall in love with people, fall in love with the curves on their bodies\
  \ and color of their eyes. I fell in love with Berlin, with the structures of the\
  \ buildings. The red stone architecture that stands tall and proud admits the eccentric,\
  \ neoteric towers. The educational murals that is the infamous Berlin wall. The\
  \ monuments, the Memorial to the murdered Jews of Europe, which holds so much power\
  \ and meaning but is belittled by the ignorance of the average millennial selfie\
  \ taker, pretending to be zen and embrace their inner yogi. The touristic ways can\
  \ be so insensitive to the heritage, the painful past and the glorious victories\
  \ of a country. I feel an apology forming in my mind.   \n\nThe vibration of my\
  \ phone drags me back to the reality, I check the time. Such a normal thing to do,\
  \ checking the time, but I\u2019m disgusted at the sentiment. I don\u2019t want\
  \ to leave but I know I must. I can't help but wonder if hindsight will thank me\
  \ for making the choice to return or will this decision haunt me, for not taking\
  \ the leap? It\u2019s a true case of should I stay, or should I go? Conflicted with\
  \ such indecision, I rise to my feet and taking a deep breath and walk towards the\
  \ train station, each step a struggle to take. I whisper such the sweetest goodbye!"
