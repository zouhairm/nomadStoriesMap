  \ start to find some places which I have to traval,after that I started first I\
  \ was gone for \"Ratanghar ford\", the Ratangarh ford is an a ford of India's biggest\
  \ king \"CHATRAPATI SHIVAJI MAHARAJ\" who from Maharashtra. It is 3000 ft mountain\
  \ and at the top of the mountain the ford was made. The ford was made in 1600BC.\
  \ It's a very good place for tracking purposes, and you also do the camping at top\
  \ of the mountain. But you have to take one civilian with you for your security\
  \ and for making food and etc.\n    After the Ratangarh ford I have searched an\
  \ another place to treak that names \"Sandan Whaley\" it is a big Whaley which is\
  \ 2500ft highted and there is an a waterfall which shine in Rainey season. So you\
  \ can enjoy yourself in a peaceful and soulful area and you can enjoy you freedom\
  \ there.\n\n                                                  THANK YOU !"
