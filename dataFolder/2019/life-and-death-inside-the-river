Text: "I saw myself floating in a dark blue abyss, watching as the light coming through\
  \ the small spaces between the rocks above would cut the silent water and reveal\
  \ the details deep down. I felt like flying inside a uterus full of nutrients, relaxing\
  \ my entire body, giving myself to a perfect rebirth opportunity. Actually, that\
  \ was how Chapada Diamantina killed me and brought me back to life.\n \nGetting\
  \ around had seemed to be a simple task so far since we had been so connected to\
  \ that place. There was a different sense of gravity brought up by the magnitude\
  \ of mountains and trees, their movements aligned with the climate and the wildlife.\
  \ After facing a fourteen-hour drive and entering a royal portal at Chapada's first\
  \ view, my friends and I were feeling like characters in a magic realism novel.\
  \ With a thrilling adventurous sensation, opened to experiences and empowered by\
  \ that freedom, we were driven into an incredibly weird death experience.\n\nChapada\
  \ Diamantina (Bahia, Brazil) is a river encounter territory and has some of the\
  \ biggest waterfalls in South America. That morning, we were headed towards Burac\xE3\
  o waterfall, located between the cities of Ibicoara and Len\xE7\xF3is. Of course,\
  \ we didn't think a tour guide would be mandatory or even necessary; we had underestimated\
  \ the wilderness levels of that dazzling greenery.\n\nGilligan drove for about one\
  \ hour and a half throughout a dusty road that took us deep inside the Bahian backlands,\
  \ the landscape swallowing us more and more each time we drove by a solitary hovel\
  \ along the way. I was apprehensive, and at some point suggested we should go back\
  \ \u2013 we were obviously going nowhere \u2013 but Dani kept on saying we were\
  \ almost there. The road was worse and worse and the path was getting steep. Then,\
  \ Lou saw a sign that said \u201CWelcome to Rumo\u201D right before these gloomy\
  \ little settlements. As our car passed through small brick houses, the few people\
  \ who were on the streets would follow us, moving their heads along. We went by\
  \ the phantom village and kept on driving.\n\nWay ahead Rumo, I was certain that\
  \ we were wrong and should come back. Then, we noticed two skinny dehydrated men\
  \ standing in the middle of the woods, and it was only when we stopped to ask for\
  \ directions that we saw they were armed with one rifle each. My blood froze for\
  \ a moment in time as I starred into their red stoned eyes. They caused a discontinuance\
  \ in the scene, a gap in space-time and made me question whether that day was real\
  \ or not. The men disappeared before I could come to my senses, and, as soon as\
  \ we had decided to go all the way back, we got a flat tire. This was when we died.\n\
  \nTerrified, thirsty and burning under the midday summer sunshine, we started the\
  \ journey back and ended up going through empty and surreal Rumo again. We stopped\
  \ there to check the tire and left towards the main road, which would never, ever\
  \ come. We drove and drove for what seemed to be an endlessly repeated moment, and\
  \ I was taken to believe, by bigger magic forces, that we were in purgatory.\n\n\
  With a shout of freedom, we finally got to the main road, and then met this guy\
  \ from the gas station who revealed to us that Rumo was an extremely dangerous place.\
  \ Gilligan laughed, nervous, Lou jumped from her seat, Dani looked up in shock.\
  \ Wow, we had survived a real near-death experience. Or had we? I was confused and\
  \ intrigued, but, as we headed back to Len\xE7\xF3is and decided to take a quick\
  \ look at heaven, I could start to understand.\n\nIn a perfect synchronic ending,\
  \ we saw the entrance to Po\xE7o Azul, a shiny blue cave where you could float and\
  \ look around the deep pit. The perfect silence and blueish shapes we could see\
  \ while moving slowly inside the water created the necessary after death experience:\
  \ it looked like we were healing in paradise. And that's how Bahia showed me nature\
  \ has destiny's mysteries within, and how small and important we're able to be,\
  \ at the same time."
