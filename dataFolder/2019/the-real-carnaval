Text: "The massive crush of bodies surround me as they each move in a common rhythm.\
  \ The blackness of night lies beyond the party but up close all I can see are garishly\
  \ painted faces and the bouncing, gyrating bodies of fellow dancers lit by lantern\
  \ as we follow a slow-moving box truck vibrating with the bass of our chosen anthem.\
  \ The revelry is composed of four tribes; each merrily painted a different color\
  \ and converging slowly from distant corners to meet at dawn in the center of St.\
  \ George\u2019s. My friend Kelly and I had joined \u201Cblue\u201D and proudly sport\
  \ opaque slicks of paint across our faces and arms. We compliment this with our\
  \ matching giveaway \u201CCarib\u201D headscarves (the best but also only local\
  \ beer in Grenada). I feel festive even when I look around me at the beautiful island\
  \ girls and know myself to be both overdressed and tragically uncool. But if I was\
  \ going to feel self-conscious, I would feel far worse about the dancing. While\
  \ I had over a lifetime achieved the level of moving my body to the beat, the greater\
  \ population here was on the next planet. The Grenadian people had a style onto\
  \ themselves. Both the women and men appeared able to disconnect their hips from\
  \ their body at will and make a sort of winding, swiveling, swinging motion to the\
  \ drumbeat. My earnest impression earlier in the day had elicited giggles, pointing\
  \ and whispering from the island children who spied my practice session. No matter.\
  \ The vibe was contagious and though we by appearance alone stood out from the locals,\
  \ nothing that night made me feel at all unwelcome. \nThis \u201CJ\u2019ouvert\u201D\
  \ is one of the seminal events that make up Grenada\u2019s Carnaval or \u201CSpicemas\u201D\
  \ as they had renamed it, adding a personal touch by rifting on their reputation\
  \ as \u201Cthe Spice Isle.\u201D The origins of the event are hazy but like Carnaval\
  \ appear to have evolved from the liberation of the West Indies from the colonization\
  \ of the French around the 18th century. The name, \u201CJ\u2019ouvert\u201D is\
  \ theorized to be a colloquial version of the phrase \u201Cjou ouv\xE8\u201D which\
  \ is the local Creole French term for \u201Cdaybreak.\u201D It is the night before\
  \ precursor to the \u201CPretty Mas\u201D parade which is the typical image that\
  \ comes to mind concerning Carnaval- participants dancing in parade rows wearing\
  \ extravagant costumes, festooned with feathers, sequins and ruffles. \nTwo nights\
  \ before this, we had found ourselves at the Cricket Stadium where we and a rancorous\
  \ crowd listened as different SoCa (Southern Caribbean) steel drum bands played\
  \ their original songs in honor of Carnaval and cheered for our favorites to win.\
  \ The location created an atmosphere akin to a high school football game where a\
  \ comfortable familiarity, excitement and competition permeated the warm August\
  \ air. People yelled between seats both at friends and strangers who favored other\
  \ songs than theirs. Women danced to the music and everyone screamed with abandon\
  \ to cheer on their favorites. A winner was selected but all of the songs created\
  \ were put onto a cd that the entire island seemed to blast out of their vehicles\
  \ on repeat for days afterward. Of course, I purchased my own from a vendor later.\n\
  The Grenadian fervor to celebrate their history and freedom through music and dancing\
  \ was a revelation to me. Dancing through the night to the soundtrack made for that\
  \ moment is the most free I have ever felt. Grenada\u2019s deeply joyful and expressive\
  \ traditions resonated to my newly realized core. I never expected to find myself\
  \ so in love with the wild abandon of Grenada and its\u2019 people. Though I have\
  \ not yet made a return to Carnival, that feeling of being purely alive is something\
  \ that I have never forgotten. On a regular basis, I attempt to recapture that feeling\
  \ by accepting whatever invitation is offered to try something new or to wander\
  \ and explore my city in the moments between the organized and responsible parts\
  \ of my life. Sometimes when nothing else satisfies, I dig out that old Carnaval\
  \ CD, take myself to Grenada in my mind and practice my SoCal dance skills around\
  \ the living room."
