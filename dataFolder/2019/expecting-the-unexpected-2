Text: "Telling a story with an unexpected end is totally expected. You're hanging\
  \ on the edge of the bed, waiting for that twist. I have always thought that when\
  \ it comes to adventure and traveling, an unexpected beginning is that twist that\
  \ makes you realize the unexpected. That's exactly how my trip to Bogota, Colombia\
  \ was. It was my first time outside of Mexico and I couldn't say everything went\
  \ as planned, because gladly it didn't. I arrived in Colombia 5 days before New\
  \ Year's Eve and I stayed at my best friend's house. His name is Juan Camilo and\
  \ he couldn't be more Colombian, and that's what I love the most about him, every\
  \ time he goes back to Colombia and he tells me about it, it's like if it was his\
  \ first time there. I think that's one of the reasons I wanted to go so much.\n\n\
  \ Apparently,  I thought I was going to be spending the whole week walking around\
  \ Bogota, experiencing the food, hearing the people say new words that not even\
  \ other Spanish speakers understand very well, such as 'chimba' 'vaina' and 'paila',\
  \ believe me, I wasn't trying to rhyme those words, it's just the beauty of them.\
  \ Nevertheless, I got to spend just two days in Bogota before we left to a small\
  \ town in Santander called Barichara, where we spent the last days before New Year's\
  \ Eve in a little and rustic hotel. Our days were spent walking around town during\
  \ the golden hour, eating the best dishes I've ever had, swimming during the day\
  \ and dancing salsa and vallenato all night, surrounded not only by Colombians but\
  \ by people all around the world, who like me, for at least one second felt like\
  \ we all came from one single place\n\nOn New Year's Eve we had dinner with every\
  \ single person at the hotel and even if I didn't know them very well, I couldn't\
  \ stop laughing at their jokes and smiling every time they tried to make a Mexican\
  \ accent. To be honest, at midnight was when the magic finally began. The tradition\
  \ is to eat 12 grapes and every time you eat one of them you have to make a wish\
  \ for the new year. It's like getting 12 birthday wishes, but they are filled with\
  \ purpose. You have to stand up for them, no one has to believe them more than you.\
  \ That specific night I was standing with my plate of grapes on my hands, looking\
  \ at everyone dancing, drinking and hugging each other with that special latin warmth.\
  \ On that exact moment, I realized I didn't know what I wanted to wish for, and\
  \ not because I didn't have any purposes or wishes for the new year, but because\
  \ for the very first time, I felt like everything I needed was to stay in that moment\
  \ for a little longer. What I really wished for, with only one grape on my mouth\
  \ was to be present in that moment and in every single one that came after that.\
  \ That was the magic of my first trip, finding the unexpected on a different land\
  \ and within myself."
