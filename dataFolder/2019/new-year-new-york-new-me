Text: "I stood at the bottom of the stairs at 42nd Street Station, New York City.\
  \ I had my phone in one hand, my camera in the other. This was it. I was about to\
  \ step out into Times Square. I was about to see New York for the first time. I\
  \ maintained my composure even though inside my heart was pacing. I am not the kind\
  \ of person who is so excited at Christmas that they tear the paper off. I slowly\
  \ unwrap each edge, making the moment as long as I possibly can. That is what I\
  \ was doing now. As I slowly climbed each step, I was greeted with loud bustling\
  \ symphony of cars, people and music wrapped in a myriad of colourful billboards.\
  \ My eyes widened and with that so did my smile. I could no longer pretend that\
  \ I was composed.  My eyes followed the length of the building as they touched the\
  \ sky. I stood in awe.  At 22 years old I had made it to the other side of the world.\
  \ Here I was alone in the unknown with everything I knew about New York coming from\
  \ a life of watching Friends. In that moment I knew I had made the right decision.\
  \ \nMy friends called me brave. \nMy tutors asked if I was sure I wanted to do this\
  \ semester abroad in a country where no other student was going. \nMy parents repeated\
  \ all the administrative things I had to take care of before I leave London. \n\
  And myself; well I was thinking of how for the first time in 22 years the melanin\
  \ in my skin would be something I had to think about. I know I shouldn\u2019t have\
  \ to but how could I not? It would be na\xEFve to ignore the political climate of\
  \ America.  \nIt had all been a rush; getting a visa, securing a dorm room, subletting\
  \ my current room. When I made it on the plane finally ready to relax, I remembered\
  \ I had to call my telephone network, followed by a quick call from my parents,\
  \ wishing me a safe flight and to send them a message as soon as I can. Finally\
  \ with everything that had to be done finally over, we were now ready to leave.\
  \ As if the world knew I needed a peaceful trip, I had two seats to myself. I fastened\
  \ my seat belt and routinely did all my checks before the captain informed us that\
  \ it was time to leave. I looked out of my window and there a beautiful orange sky\
  \ stared back at me. London was giving me one last hoorah and in that moment I sighed.\
  \ It is only then that I put my brain into neutral and emptied it out. It was time\
  \ to enjoy this sunset and look forward to what was awaiting me across the pond.\
  \ \nI stood at the bottom of the stairs at 42nd Street Station, New York City. I\
  \ had my phone in one hand, my camera in the other. This was it. I was about to\
  \ step out into Times Square. I was about to see New York for the first time. It\
  \ was in this moment that it finally dawned on me. This city was so much more than\
  \ I could have ever imagined it to be. I was brave, as I recalled my friends saying.\
  \ This experience not just going to class and furthering my education. It went beyond\
  \ my love for travel. This was a moment of growth and self love. This was my time\
  \ to get to know myself. I stood in Times Square taking it all in. I saw my reflection\
  \ on my phone. I could not wait to see who this girl would be in five months."
