Text: "\"Take the bus till Mundet and then go straight, it's simple you cannot get\
  \ lost!\" said the nice, beardy, scrawny man. I was literally seething, I knew it\
  \ was the last chance. \nFinally the bus arrived, the chubby driver asked me where\
  \ I needed to stop. I gently replied: Mundet. He checked me from top to toe and\
  \ he muttered that there wasn't it anymore and to get there I needed to walk nearly\
  \ one hour from the last bus stop. \nI huffed but i thought it was no big deal to\
  \ walk one hour. In for a penny, in for a pound right?\n\nMy name is Ernestine,\
  \ I did all the way down to Barcelona from Canterbury to finally find the missing\
  \ piece, my past was forcing me. \n\nI took a seat on the bus and I soon start looking\
  \ out of the window. The city passing by, all those colorful and and lively spring\
  \ flowers. I even start to fantasize about what could have happened next. After\
  \ a while I started noticing the other passenger through the reflection in the window.\
  \ A bespectacled boy, focused on the popular black mirror hoping for a call; a wrinkly\
  \ 65-ish old lady probably annoyed by the noise that the young students were making\
  \ at the bottom of the bus and lastly a man with a kind face, sparkly eyes and a\
  \ funny beret. \nSuddenly the bus stopped and the engine turned-off. It was the\
  \ last stop. \n\nI got off and as I probably appeared lost, the man with the funny\
  \ beret asked me if I needed some help. Without thinking I replied with a big YES\
  \ and i suddenly felt more confident and protected.\nAfter have told him everything,\
  \ we started walking all the long way while doing quick stopovers for street food\
  \ and stalls.\nBarcelona is such a welcoming city and it's so fascinating wander\
  \ between the tight streets. The funny man was silent just like me, enjoying the\
  \ incredible feeling that only travelers can comprehend. \n\nAn Eucalyptus, just\
  \ in front of me. This incredible mighty tree that woke up so many memories. In\
  \ a while I was at the entrance of the Labyrinth Park of Horta. I said goodbye to\
  \ the nice man, he knew I needed to do this alone. Before entering, I sat for a\
  \ minute to regain my strenght. Seventy years old are not a joke. \nWell, the Labyrinth\
  \ was my husband and I last place to visit. We traveled across all the continents\
  \ and cities. We chose a green, incredible, beautiful spot in every place on Earth\
  \ with the aim to plant a little Euclayptus. And this Labyrinth was the green heart\
  \ of Barcelona. The Euclayptus was already there, waiting for my smile and my memories,\
  \ althought the Labyrith was not so green anymore. \nI can't tell you what it meant\
  \ to lay my weary eyes on this visual. The park was full of Eucalyptus. My husband\
  \ was there, with me, in my eyes and in my beating heart. \n\nOn my way back home\
  \ I couldn't stop smiling, the last mark on the piece of paper we made together.\
  \ I made it. I finished it. I could hear his laugh and see his funny beret, just\
  \ like the kind man on the bus."
