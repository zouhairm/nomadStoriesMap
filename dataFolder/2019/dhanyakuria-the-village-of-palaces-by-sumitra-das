Text: "It was a winter morning when my husband and I chose to go for a long drive\
  \ to Basirhat a nearby place to Kolkata. While driving through Taki Road from Barasat\
  \ towards Basirhat the landscape started changing and suddenly we noticed an European\
  \ Medieval styled gate with two towers. On close observations it was perceived that\
  \ on the top of the gate there was a statue of two men fighting with a lion. We\
  \ got down from the car however my husband was not allowed to enter the castle by\
  \ the gatekeeper as it was an orphanage for girls. I was allowed though but only\
  \ to venture till the water body inside.  The water body didn't look like a moat\
  \ neither there was a drawbridge at the entrance. On the right top side of the castle,\
  \ there is a circular empty space on the, which looked like had housed a giant clock.\
  \ \n\n\nA village with many temples is common in any part of India, but a village\
  \ with many palaces is not. According to a local whom my husband was interacting\
  \ with whilst he was outside we were in a vallage of palace named Dhanyakuria, the\
  \ castle was built by landlord of a ZAMINDER family named GAINE. However, it was\
  \ never inhabited by the family as it was primarily built as a miniature of Windsor\
  \ Castle to please the British business partners of the Gaines and also because\
  \ it could not be completed due to World War II. He also advised to take the lane\
  \ beside the palace to go further interior to the village to find more palaces and\
  \ also to visit the ancestral home of the Gaines called the GAINEBARI which is a\
  \ 200 year old grand mansion. So to expect more unexpected we continued our journey\
  \ through the Benepara Road.\n\nThe GAINEBARI is an L-shaped mansion with 21 columns\
  \ where we were welcomed by the gatekeeper. He told us that \nthere are 60 rooms,\
  \ 30 on each floor, with an overhanging balcony that connects the row of rooms.\
  \ Access to the interiors of the Gaine Mansion was restricted. Inside the mansion\
  \ premises there is a three storied tower adorned with a dome named \u201CNazar\
  \ Minar\u201D where SEHNAI used to be played during occasions. The Gaines respected\
  \ diversity so they built the ground floor of Nazar Minar with round arches in line\
  \ of Hindu architecture, the first floor with twin arches of Islamic style and the\
  \ top floor with conical arches symbolizing Christianity. The Gaine family had a\
  \ joint venture business with the Ballavs and the Sawoos. They dealt with trading\
  \ of Jaggery, Jute etc.. So these ZAMINDERS also established mansions in this area.\
  \ There is a family get together at the GAINEBARI during Durga Puja. Many Bollywood\
  \ movies have been shot inside this palace. Inside the premise there is the temple\
  \ of the presiding deity of the family \u2013 Shyamsundar Jiu. The temple is also\
  \ L shaped and painted in peach just like the main building.\n\nA short drive away\
  \ there are two other well maintained majestic mansions which are much smaller in\
  \ size, belonging to two other prominent ZAMINDER families, the Sawoos and Ballavs.\
  \ The fresco decoration with Corinthian Pillars are the major attraction of the\
  \ Sawoo mansion. BALLAVBARI, known as House of Dolls amongst the locals, is very\
  \ interesting with idols on the terrace. It has a blend of Indian and European architecture.\
  \ The peacock symbolized royalty and power.\n\nAs we drove little further the road\
  \ encountered a huge Nine Pinnacle two storied RASMANCHA on the right. During RAS\
  \ Festival, idols of Radha Krishna get worshiped here. \n\nAt a stone throw distance\
  \ from the RASMANCHA we saw the gate of Sawoo BAGANBARI alias Sawoo farmhouse. A\
  \ huge gate adorned with Corinthian Pillars leads to a garden. This palace is impressive\
  \ too, but nowhere near in glamour and grandeur as compared to the GAINEBARI.\n\n\
  How to go: Dhanyakuria is in North 24 Pargana district of West Bengal state in India.\
  \ By road it is 52 km from Dum Dum area in Kolkata towards Basirhat via Taki Road.\n\
  Where to eat: There is no descent eatery at Dhanyakuria. It is advisable to carry\
  \ food and water."
