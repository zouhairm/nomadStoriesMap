Text: "50:50 - That\u2019s what I was referred to in school throughout my teenage\
  \ life because I was a boy who had feminine traits. My walk was \u2018girlish\u2019\
  , my voice was soft and my manner was sissy. Trust me, I tried to change. I copied\
  \ how the other boys would walk and talk and behave. But it would just not come\
  \ to me.\nI wouldn\u2019t even understand why people couldn\u2019t be nice to me,\
  \ or why I would be called out names everywhere I went. Every now and then even\
  \ my teachers would take a dig on me and leave the class in splits of laughter,\
  \ except for me of course. \n\nThere were days I would go back home feeling that\
  \ my head would explode from migraine. I would cry myself to sleep begging god for\
  \ a miracle. Something that would change me, or at least make me normal. \n\nI never\
  \ told my mom a thing because I was scared of making her sad. Moreover, I didn\u2019\
  t want her to know that I was \u2018the sissy boy\u2019 in school. I just felt that\
  \ being queer meant being disgraceful and I didn\u2019t want her to think of me\
  \ like that. Even though, I knew that she knew. \nI never had one single friend\
  \ in school because of course who would want to be associated with 50:50 (half boy,\
  \ half girl). For 18 years of my life I only knew mockery, despise and hate. Except\
  \ when I would be home, surrounded by my mom and my sisters. Only then would I feel\
  \ loved. \n\nBut everything changed in 2014 when I went to Sao Paulo, Brazil for\
  \ an Internship. For the first time in my life I saw people who were like me, people\
  \ who were accepted for who they were, and they were happy. Even though Brazil is\
  \ far from being completely bereft of prejudice it was still years ahead of what\
  \ India is and has been to me. \n\nOne week had gone by and I had already settled\
  \ down in my new place, while still adjusting to the culture and the language. It\
  \ was on one of these days as I was walking down the colourful streets in downtown\
  \ Sao Paulo, I came across a flyer that was about the annual Sao Paulo LGBT Pride\
  \ Parade. I had no idea what it was. So I googled about it and then decided to go\
  \ and see it for myself. Apparently, it\u2019s the largest LGBT pride parade of\
  \ the world that brings over 5 million people on the streets annually. What I saw\
  \ and experienced completely changed my perspective. All I saw was freedom, acceptance\
  \ and above all \u2018LOVE\u2019. Love in all its forms and all its glory. \n\n\
  It was there that I finally found out the answer to the question that had bothered\
  \ me and traumatised me all my life.\n\u201CWhy am I the way I am?\u201D, and the\
  \ answer was there right in front of me. \nAs clear as the sky on a bright sunny\
  \ day. \nI was Gay. I always were. \nI realised that I was never weird or a disgrace.\
  \ I was perfectly normal in this imperfect world. \nI had heard of the term, \u2018\
  tears of joy\u2019. But it was only until that day I discovered what it truly meant.\n\
  \nTravelling to Brazil was something I had never planned as a journey of self discovery.\
  \ It was purely meant to boost my resume for a better job and a good career. \n\
  But what I found out on that trip was something that would go on to change my life\
  \ forever. \nI found out that I would never ever have to feel alone, hiding in the\
  \ shadows and waiting for a cure to make me act manly, just so that I could fit\
  \ in. \n\nSome say, travelling heals and cures. Others say, it brings joy and happiness.\
  \ For me it turned out to be \u2018an answer\u2019."
