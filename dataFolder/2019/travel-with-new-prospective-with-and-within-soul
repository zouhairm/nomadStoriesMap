Text: "Sunrise was same as everday but that day i felt that this sun has risen only\
  \ for me, breeze was also same but that day i felt breeze was flowing only for me,\
  \ birds were aslo migrating same but that day i felt that they are flying only for\
  \ me...showing how high you have to fly. \n\nThe journey was started from somewhere\
  \ on earth , place was new for me but trees nearby were same providing shadows ,fruits\
  \ and peacefull sound of leaves,trees give fruits to us as of their own body parts\
  \ without any impromada of giving, this taught me how one should give others.\n\n\
  Breeze was moving lightly just carring all types of smells with it..either it is\
  \ good or bad it carries smell with him just doing his duty ..this taught me Renunciation\
  \ and untidyness of karma.\n\nSky was same long long and till all around where eyes\
  \ goes same in blue and bright, same decades ago and today also, this taught me\
  \ stability.\n\nNature is same but it taught me prospective towards life... After\
  \ this splendid journey with observation and learning from nature we reached destination..it\
  \ was at height top of mountains in sahyadri's mountain range ; just needed to open\
  \ the hands,mind and heart to feel the breeze, nature and sunshine. Accumulate them\
  \ in the soul and for the perfect journey of life, And to live this movement forever....forever.\
  \ The day was ended but feeling didn't the endless night sky above just said before\
  \ closing eyes for sleep that...world is infinite you just need a proper protective\
  \ to look towards it to really know the art of being more than living in life."
