Text: "My mind wanders, my soul seeks to return to where it can be secluded and feel\
  \ absobloominlutely. \nThe City, Constantinople, is History itself.  Somewhere in\
  \ the distance, I can still see Justinian consulting with Belisarius and Narsi at\
  \ the horse-race track on how to suppress the Nika revolution, while the atmosphere\
  \ vibrates from the loud cries of outrage and war from the Venetians and the Greens.\
  \ History has its own way to lure you, while in reality you are pacing up and down\
  \ Sultanahmet square and in the background the Mavi Cami pops up, with its six minarets\
  \ as guards and the Hodja voice calling upon the faithful. Further down, diagonally,\
  \ you can see the Yerebatan Sarn\u0131c\u0131, built on the first hill of Constantinople,\
  \ not well- known to the public, even though Dan Brown\u2019s \u201CInferno\u201D\
  \ seduces and challenges readers to walk down the steps and wonder around the Doric\
  \ style columns, coming up from the water and illuminated with red light. This is\
  \ a different, separate aquatic world, lost in the centuries, full of mystique.\
  \ \nClimbing the stairs, back into reality, you come across the Great Church and\
  \ the mind cannot help but stare at misty-eyed Solomon announcing to Justinian \u201C\
  we won\u201D. Your imagination surpasses the bleary vision of reality and in front\
  \ of you Epiphanios, Anthimos and Minas appear, chanting the Akathist Hymn from\
  \ the altar, while the church candle light trembles and Theodora and Constantine\
  \ wander inside the Great Church whispering. There is so much to see and feel inside\
  \ this Church. \nContinuing my tour, I make a stop at the Saint Irene church, in\
  \ the yard of Topkap\u0131 Saray\u0131. I strongly urge you to stop and gage at\
  \ the Sea of Vosporos, it is truly worth it. Indulge yourself spending time at the\
  \ Kapali \xC7ar\u015Fisi, past the Gate of Galata, take a big breath and inhale\
  \ the smell and taste of the Misir \xC7ar\u015Fisi spices, which will haunt your\
  \ bittersweet memories. Remember, we are not here for shopping. Focus on passing\
  \ by Yeni Camii before reaching the Eminonu neighbourhood in Karakoy, through Galata\
  \ Koprusu. When reaching Galata Kulesi, make sure to enjoy a cup of tea at the top\
  \ balcony, taking in the mesmerizing view of the old city; if you are lucky enough\
  \ you may even catch a glimpse of the Greek islands just across the sea. Then walk\
  \ towards the Dolmabah\xE7e with the enticing building; personally, I was more impressed\
  \ by the ever-moving waves that crush against it. Having spent time in Thessaloniki\
  \ as a university student, I cannot but mention the castle of Yedikule, where seven\
  \ towers, make up a cruel, unreachable, relentless prison. Let your imagination\
  \ run wild and envision riding a glorious white horse, while entering the city triumphantly\
  \ through its golden gate and climbing up the castle to gage at the sea of Marmaras\
  \ and the ships waiting to pass through the narrow straits of Vosporos. \nI have\
  \ saved the best for last, as we continue our journey on foot towards the Ecumenical\
  \ Patriarchate in Fanari. Ecclesiastical hymns arise in the air and signal greatness\
  \ through simplicity. Oh, dear Saint George, how I want to stay here in this small\
  \ oasis of New Rome, yet I feel as though I am being called from the alley down\
  \ the street, where numerous churches present before me the wonders of the history\
  \ of Christianity and ecclesiastical architecture. Suddenly, I see before me the\
  \ great Byzantine statue, in the form of an eagle with its wings spread wide open,\
  \ on the slopes of the fifth hill of the City and the dome buried in the arms of\
  \ the Golden Horn (Alt\u0131n Boynuz). It makes me whisper. The City, just like\
  \ an old lover, makes me want to come back, again and again, to sense, to smell,\
  \ to see, all those things I left behind and all those I did not get to feel simply\
  \ because I could not even imagine them."
