Text: "I never thought or imagined I would have the opportunity to trace the bloodline.\
  \ I have always wanted to find out where they came from , where did it start , why\
  \ did they come to America. \nWhen you marry a man he comes with all kinds of mysteries\
  \ and backgrounds .When I married Carlton his last name was Wadley, never knowing\
  \ his real last name was Perez, we had two children together, me the virgin bride\
  \ him the black man from New Jersey. \nThrough speaking with extended family I found\
  \ his father who was deceased was Portuguese. His real last name was Wadley . Carlton\u2019\
  s mother did everything in he power to pretend this man didn\u2019t exist. She gave\
  \ her children the last name Wadley, she hated him so much that all traces of him\
  \ were not allowed in her children\u2019s lives . \nCarlton and I We\u2019re best\
  \ friends we did everything together from reading comic books to jumping on old\
  \ mattresses in the back of the apartment complex we even had a couple jobs together.We\
  \ both thought it was a good idea to get married and live together. We married summer\
  \ of 1995 and then by 1996 I learned of his desire to know of his lineage, sometimes\
  \ it brought him to tears. He didn\u2019t know where he came from or anything about\
  \ the Portuguese culture. \nSeveral times he thought of changing his name to Perez\
  \ his fathers surname. Unfortunately Carlton did not want to hurt his mother so\
  \ he didn\u2019t explore his father or background. I truly believe it made him quite\
  \ angry , As African Americans we all have a great sense of not belonging anywhere\
  \ . We usually don\u2019t have any idea of where we come from , due to slavery our\
  \ families are spread about everywhere across the United States and abroad .\nThis\
  \ craving to belong , this fellowship, kinship even is only prevalent in white Americans,\
  \ as a race can trace their origins as far back as needed, unfortunately for us\
  \ it really takes some doing to unravel the complexities of a African American blood\
  \ line .\nI find now that my children feel compelled in the same way desperately\
  \ wanting to know where their combination skin tone and curls come from , why when\
  \ they tan do they become burned like a roasted peanut ( their words not mine) not\
  \ quite fitting into any mold available.\nMy lineage is nothing to sneeze at either\
  \ , having Dutch , Irish, American Indian on my fathers side, and ( Geechie ) American\
  \ Indian on moms side I have pretty much satisfied my mothers side of my bloodline.\
  \ \nTruthfully I know nothing about Portuguese people except what has been readily\
  \ available on tv , so unfortunately that is not much at all . \nI find it truly\
  \ remarkably sad that there are millions of people wandering America not knowing\
  \ at all where they come from . From what I understand family gives a person purpose,\
  \ a reason to keep on going ,\nIs this why so many of my\nPeople have just succumbed\
  \ to not knowing? Are they satisfied that they don\u2019t know their family crest\
  \ Or tartan! What about old world craftsmanship that is usually passed down ? \n\
  Truly I would love to take this travel journey to step on the streets of the unknown\
  \ and possibly bump Into a history that has long been forgotten in my children\u2019\
  s family. Even if it is learning the customs , foods , clothing of these people\
  \ who gave me part of the dna to make my beautiful children.\nI hope to have a backpack\
  \ and to travel this region on a eye opening, once in a lifetime journey of my family\u2019\
  s life , a opportunity to actually know ones self and be proud of where they come\
  \ from , it\u2019s aad that we all cannot have this opportunity of exploration in\
  \ our lifetimes, \nSo I would like to see how the seed did travel, just like the\
  \ flower in the meadow, A large wind makes it possible to disperse all of the seed\
  \ , and before you know it the meadow is full of new flowers \U0001F338 but I wonder\
  \ do they know where they came from? Do they ? What I do know is that flowers are\
  \ beautiful no matter their origin."
