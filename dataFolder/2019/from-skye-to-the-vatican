Text: "\u201CSpeed bonnie boat like a bird on the wind,\nOnward the sailors cry\n\
  Carry the lad that\u2019s born to be king\nOver the sea to Skye\u201D\u2026\n\n\
  Every time I hear this song I can\xB4t but feel sadness. I imagine the people that\
  \ fought and died in Culloden, Scotland dreaming of the Stuarts reigning again in\
  \ England. Nevertheless, it didn\xB4t happen\u2026\nI love British period drama,\
  \ and I am a big fan of Outlander, the famous TV show, as I am of royal history.\n\
  I have not visited Scotland yet, and still there is a calling that I must go one\
  \ day. I love the bagpipes music, the kilts and would love to visit a Scottish castle.\n\
  \nSince reading about Mary, Queen of Scots, I feel such a fascination for that land.\
  \ I read about the Jacobite\u2019s cause and learned about their desire of having\
  \ the Stuarts back in the English throne (which was occupied by the Hannovers then).\n\
  One of the characters in the Outlander TV show, was \u201CBonnie\u201D Prince Charlie,\
  \ the young pretender, who wanted to recover the throne for her family: the Stuarts.\n\
  \nHe was supported by the Jacobites, Scottish highlanders who wanted a Scottish\
  \ family back in the throne.\nUnfortunately, they were defeated by the English royal\
  \ troops, and many highlanders died in Culloden Moore, and with them, their dreams.\
  \ The bonnie Prince managed to escape, helped by Fiona, a fervent Jacobite woman.\
  \ \n\nDisguised as a maid, Charlie sailed to the Island of Skye and then to France\
  \ and Italy\u2026 and never returned to his family land.\nTwo hundred and seventy\
  \ two years later, I visited Rome and one of the places on my list was The Vatican.\
  \ After walking in the museums and the Sistine Chapel, I entered the St. Peter\xB4\
  s Basilica. I was so excited of being there. This is the largest Cristian temple\
  \ in the world and it is a place full of art, history and graves. \n\nI visited\
  \ the Popes\u2019 tombs in the lower floor and then returned to the altar. Then\
  \ started reading the names written on the graves, the years those people lived\
  \ and thought about the connections they may had to be resting in that sacred place.\
  \ \nAnd there it was: A monument to the Stuarts. I found \u201CBonnie\u201D Prince\
  \ Charlie\u2019s grave! Along with his father and brother\u2019s. The Stuarts as\
  \ the Scottish people were Catholics.\nWhen England separated from the Vatican,\
  \ so Henry VIII could marry Ann Boleyn, Scotland remained a Catholic kingdom. When\
  \ Elizabeth I, the last Tudor died, James Stuart ascended to the throne. As Scottish,\
  \ he was catholic, but had to allow the Anglican religion when the two kingdoms\
  \ were unified. \n\nA question came: Why were Bonnie Prince Charlie and his family\
  \ buried in St. Peter\xB4s Basilica? Well, his brother Henry Benedict was a cardinal\
  \ and for the Vatican, the Stuarts were the rightful heirs to the English throne.\n\
  I admired the marble grave, simple but elegant. Two beautiful angels in the sides\
  \ guarded it. The faces of the three Stuarts were carved in the elegant stone and\
  \ their names and royal titles were written in Latin. \n\nThis monument may not\
  \ be fit for a king and is descendants, but it is a place where they rest in peace.\n\
  I stood there, imagined the Culloden battle, the escape to France and then to Italy\
  \ and pictured Prince Charlie, an immature young prince, who fought for his cause,\
  \ joined by the Scottish clans in their last attempt to recover the throne for his\
  \ family. In my mind, I saw him, recalling on his mind, and the boat \u201Cover\
  \ the sea to Skye\u201D."
