Text: "*This is just a little part*\n\nDay 1 :\n\nWe landed, my boyfriend and I, at\
  \ Schiphol airport in Amsterdam. We then took the train that took us to Amsterdam\
  \ Centraal Station. \nSince then, we took the tram number 2 and we went down very\
  \ close to our hotel which was fairly well located, we were 13 minutes by metro.\n\
  After dropping our suitcases at the hotel, we decided to head for Dam Square, which\
  \ is the most important square in the old city of Amsterdam. On the way, we stopped\
  \ for lunch at Blue Amsterdam, a restaurant we found by chance and we were pleasantly\
  \ surprised! Indeed, we had a wonderful view of Amsterdam, not bad as the first\
  \ restaurant!\nAfter taking full eyes and belly, lol, we took the road again and\
  \ we walked the Leidsestraat and La Kalverstraat, these are the two main shopping\
  \ streets of downtown Amsterdam. We took the opportunity to make our first purchases,\
  \ it was stronger than us!\nAmong other things, we decided to taste the famous \"\
  space cake\", these are made cookies available in several flavors (chocolate, vanilla,\
  \ coconut, etc ...) but the particularity is that there is cannabis to inside. The\
  \ cookies were very good and the dose of cannabis was not high. It was 4 pm and\
  \ the night was already beginning to fall on Amsterdam, the perfect moment for a\
  \ small photo of Dam Square with its illuminated tree!\nAt the end of the day, we\
  \ returned to the hotel and looked for a place to dine. We wanted to go to the Hard\
  \ Rock Caf\xE9 Amsterdam but at 8pm there was already no table available and impossible\
  \ to book, super cool !\nComing out of the Hard Rock, we ended up in front of a\
  \ SUMO Japanese restaurant that caught our attention, so we were tempted. Well we\
  \ did well to enter this restaurant, the decor was beautiful, it felt like being\
  \ in Japan! Not to mention dishes, a wonder! If you are also visiting Amsterdam,\
  \ this is a good place not to miss.\n\nDay 2 :\n\nAfter a good night's sleep, we\
  \ went to Pancakes Amsterdam and of course had some pancakes. For my boyfriend it\
  \ was pancakes with maple syrup and bacon, and for me with strawberry jam, not very\
  \ light all that but so good!\nThen we headed to the Jordaan district, which is\
  \ for the record, located northwest of Amsterdam, and bounded by a few well-known\
  \ canals: the Leidsegracht to the south, the Lijnbaansgracht to the west, the Prinsengracht\
  \ to East and Bouwersgracht to the north. The district itself is crossed by 5 canals,\
  \ all listed as World Heritage by Unesco.\nWe had a nice part of our day in this\
  \ area. Indeed, we found Westerkerk, which is the largest Protestant church in Netherland\
  \ and dates from 1631, the house of Anne Frank, the museum of the tulip, symbol\
  \ of Holland, also the cheese museum, but also various shops vintage and bohemian.\n\
  We continued our walk outside the Jordaan district, and we joined the old Amsterdam,\
  \ in which there is the cannabis museum. What we have learned from this visit is\
  \ that there are more than forty different kinds of cannabis plants, it's huge!\n\
  All this walk made us hungry, so we opted for a noodle bar, Ramen-Ya. Again, we\
  \ were pleasantly surprised by the fine Japanese cuisine and also by the staff.\
  \ It was a real delight, yummy !\nAfter this nice little dish of ramen, we ventured\
  \ without too much itinerary at that time, and we arrived in the famous Red Light\
  \ District, the Red district! We especially understood when we saw several sex shops\
  \ next to each other.\nBut what is his story? It turns out that the red light district\
  \ of Amsterdam is the oldest district of the city. It is also located in the heart\
  \ of the historic heart of the Dutch capital, the Red Light District is represented\
  \ by the De Wallen district. Indeed, what is called red light district is actually\
  \ a historical nickname. The red color is actually linked to the red lights that\
  \ come to color the windows in which the prostitutes are exposed under the eyes\
  \ of passers-by."
