  It\u2019s prettier on Canada\u2019s side,\u201D what travelers who visit Niagra\
  \ Falls often say. The northern hemisphere was at the edge of fall, the time people\
  \ dread as leaves are dead because, \u201Cwinter is coming!\u201D \n  Walking through\
  \ the streets late evenings, you realize it\u2019s more than only a tourist spot,\
  \ green hills, fresh air & that overwhelming feelings of adventure. I decided that\
  \ instead of seeing all the pretty areas, i\u2019d like to see a day in the life\
  \ of those who call it home. \n  Kids playing on open grass fields, elderly taking\
  \ strolls & having a laugh; i stood there to watch this for sometime to see these\
  \ locals away from the falls & the noisy downtown restaurants & bars taking joy\
  \ in open outdoors. This had me thinking that traveling isn\u2019t only about taking\
  \ pictures at & of breathtaking spots but temporarily becoming a part of that environment\
  \ which makes travel feel so sensual, a new level you might say. \n  I adore nature\
  \ & so I tend to take more time than the rest to stay out longer & marvel at the\
  \ scenes; the falls is tremendoulsy wonderful in late evenings, the lights go out\
  \ after a while & there\u2019s the moon & stars that slowly start to appear after\
  \ you see a few then there\u2019s more. The heavy pours of water, a few droplets\
  \ hitting your face like a wet kiss on the cheek & cold air is what made me stay\
  \ at the viewing deck for so long. It gives you a sense of peace, a feeling of belonging.\
  \ You turn around behind you & there\u2019s lights of the resorts  & streets as\
  \ if they were decorations. \n  Visiting Niagra Falls has changed the way i perceive\
  \ traveling; it\u2019s about taking a part of the place with you wherever you go\
  \ & leaving a small part of you there too, nature is everywehre so find yourself\
  \ in different places."
