Text: "Veni, vidi, amari. Or at least these were the first words of my amazement when\
  \ I saw the famous Hungarian sea. \u201CSea? In Hungary?!\u201D - you would question\
  \ me. Yes. And no.\nI\u2019ve seen many places in my life, but the expression \u201C\
  Hungarian sea\u201D really left me wondering. You might have probably guessed by\
  \ now that I\u2019m actually talking not about the sea but the lake Balaton, which\
  \ is considered to be the Hungarian sea. Fairly enough, though, bearing in mind\
  \ it\u2019s significance for the Hungarian nation.\nAnd for thousands of those who\
  \ come to see it every year. Light-blue waters, pleasant traditional atmosphere,\
  \ many historical spots along with its size on the map make this Central Europe\u2019\
  s biggest lake a cherished destination.\nEarly in the morning we went to D\xE9li\
  \ railway station in Buda to buy the tickets. We were surprised by how unbearably\
  \ hot was it that morning in the Hungarian capital; the day before it had been raining\
  \ with the hugest raindrops I had ever seen, it was almost a tropical rain - yet\
  \ in the center of Budapest.\nThe train was fully booked, but we were lucky to secure\
  \ the places. Despite Balaton being a popular touristic destination, we didn\u2019\
  t hear any other language on the train except the Hungarian. The journey took us\
  \ two hours.\nHaving arrived to the station with the enigmatic name \u0160iofok,\
  \ we immediately went to the lake. Having good infrastructure, the area around the\
  \ water is ideal for tourists and locals, yet at the same time the natural beauty\
  \ is preserved and in some places remains nearly untouched. We rested on the grass\
  \ near the waterfront and fed the swans (one of the Balaton\u2019s must-have activities)\
  \ and decided to take a ferry to the Tihany Abby, which is situated on the top of\
  \ the hill on small peninsula which penetrates the lake. Many people immediately\
  \ go swimming, but I wouldn\u2019t recommend this if your main objective isn\u2019\
  t to spend a day sunbathing - the water isn\u2019t usually warm even in July, and\
  \ it\u2019s better to wait until the evening.\nWe took the ferry and arrived in\
  \ 30 minutes, changed for a small touristic train which resembled children\u2019\
  s locomotive and went up the hill through traditional picturesque Hungarian villages,\
  \ light-green pastures and cozy souvenir shops you can smell the aroma of lavender\
  \ from. Actually, you can smell it everywhere around the lake. Then we finally observed\
  \ the Abby which turned out to be a relatively small convent, but it had been established\
  \ in 1055 (!) in the times of Kingdom of Hungary, and revealed so much of the history\
  \ to us.\nTurning behind the convent, we got struck dumb by the view. This absolutely\
  \ tranquil view above the turquoise waters which I close my eyes now and see. Many\
  \ white sailboats like seagulls were slightly shaking in the rays of the midday\
  \ sun, merging in the yellowish orangeness of the day...\nThe area near the Abby\
  \ has many little cosy taverns. Unlike many popular places, Tihany surprised me\
  \ with the variety of special traditional restaurants, with the menu full of local\
  \ dishes. Being vegetarian, I decided to take a cold berry soup with custard and\
  \ almond - it went so good with the weather and the inimitable atmosphere.\nLater\
  \ we decided to burn some calories (I used to be so heavily into counting them!)\
  \ and take advantage of the territory. Large gardens with wild roses gently tied\
  \ up, soothing shadow of the trees, peaceful walking paths... there you\u2019re\
  \ really resting your body and soul. Nowadays such places are rare and precious.\n\
  I wouldn\u2019t allow myself to finish without mentioning unique souvenir shops\
  \ we saw after a walk. These shops were so cosy with local crimson roofs and chimney\
  \ that I wouldn\u2019t really call myself a chain spender, but I absolutely had\
  \ to buy something. The goods were memorable with such high quality. I bought some\
  \ lavender (no surprise!) pads, homemade honey and oils. And magnets. Can\u2019\
  t do without magnets.\nAnd now, every time I close my eyes and think about Balaton,\
  \ I recall white shivering sails, pacifying tranquility of the nature, calmness\
  \ and vast azure expanses of the lake. And lavender. Lavender, lavender, lavender..."
