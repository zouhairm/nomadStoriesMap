Text: "When I arrived in Rio de Janeiro I had all the first impressions that a tourist\
  \ does. Also called by \u201CWonderful City\u201D Rio has all things that makes\
  \ a perfect city like beaches, mountains and cool people. I had the opportunity\
  \ to stay in a native\u2019s home and know how people live there, I was in a city\
  \ called Niter\xF3i who is connected to Rio by a bridge. \n\nMaking a connection\
  \ requires time and talks, if you are a shy person it will be harder for you, but\
  \ with a little effort you can make many friends too. I had the opportunity to stay\
  \ with a woman who had a movie rental place, and my friend and I went there almost\
  \ every day to meet new people. In addition, we knew many people by starting a conversation\
  \ asking what kind of movie they liked. \n\nWith a few days, we had some friends\
  \ to hang out. One of them took us to a pool club, it was summer and we had a lot\
  \ of fun, besides the pool he made us a special lunch, with many traditional food,\
  \ it was very special for us, even though we knew some of the ingredients by the\
  \ fact that we live in the same country. Many customs from other states are different\
  \ from ours. \n\nAnother thing that you may know when you are staying with locals\
  \ is that they have jobs and commitments and you have to understand this. They cannot\
  \ go with you in all of your tours, but they will make an effort to indicate to\
  \ you very beautiful and interesting places. This is one of the reasons of making\
  \ different friends is important. \n\nBrazil is a very large country, it has 26\
  \ states, and all of them have different special things from each other. The most\
  \ important thing to make a local connection is being open to know people and talk\
  \ to them, be a nice person can make all the difference in your trip."
