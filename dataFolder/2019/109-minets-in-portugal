Text: '"I was born by the sea, which may surprise me?" by looking at the ticket I
  said. Stepping slowly aboard the plane the passengers began to nudge me in the side
  with their bags: Move!" Oh no, I''m still in thought. I boarded and ordered champagne.
  Well for you forever the blue sea and drank in one gulp. we landed on the lands
  of wonderful Portugal in the morning. the sun was warming the asphalt and slowly
  shuffling along. I had a photo camera on my neck. hmm, he does not come in handy
  to me and as soon as I said it all changed. I got into a multicolored tale of gingerbread
  houses. can not be. people watched from the balconies and smiled sweetly at the
  rising sun. it enlightened their faces with light. they drank coffee and chatted
  nicely shouting to their neighbors in the distance. I smiled, they shook me back.
  gesture I asked where I can buy coffee. they began to depict me how in the game
  krakodil some thick uncle with a beard named jo. as I understood it is the most
  excellent coffee. i went off. Joe made an excellent latte. the foam was aerial like
  clouds over the ocean. h sat ns shore and looked like gulls fly away into the distance
  happiness filled my soul'
