Text: 'We were a couple of two, a French guy and a Spanish girl, doing a road trip
  in Italy from Bologna to Napoli, stopping by Rome. We got lost in the train station
  the second day and we ended up in Venice. It was a bit scaring because it was late
  in the evening and there were no more trains to go back to Rome, our next stop.
  So we met an Italian 60-year-old couple by pure chance. They were saying goodbye
  to a friend of theirs when they found us without suitcases, without a map and without
  money. They didn''t asked for anything in return, they just accomadate us in their
  appartment making us feel it as our home.  We spent 2 days with them in Venice,
  they showed us every secret place in Venice: from the best local restaurants from
  the best small bays. They also showed us some photographs from when they were younger,
  where we could see the huge change this city had suffered. Venice was a broad palette
  of pastel colors. We were lucky to have them because it was impossible to have a
  better chance to get to know the capital of the Veneto region.

  Now we feel very lucky to have taken the wrong train, to have lost our suitcases.
  We stablished a so strong bond with them, they are coming to Spain in 3 weeks.'
