Text: "I trembled as I cautiously boarded the cable car. I had only heard of this\
  \ in what I then believed to be fiction and folk tales. How is it possible that\
  \ a climate can change so drastically from scorching hot to glacier cold? Austria\
  \ had been infamous for alluding its tourists to believe that it's summers were\
  \ hot so I had not understood why I had been instructed to bring a jacket.\n As\
  \ the cable car went up sluggishly, the lush green terrain gave way to grey dull\
  \ stones. I did not expect to discover any life up at those incredible heights but\
  \ I could not have made a sillier judgement. \"Look over there!\", one of my friends\
  \ shouted. She used her keen eyes to spot an Alpine Ibex that utilized its camouflage\
  \ in an attempt not to be seen. Black ravens dove across the sky, and I began to\
  \ wonder if this had been the same Austria we have just been in several moments\
  \ earlier. The cable car came to a relaxed stop but I could not have been more apprehensive.\
  \ \"I hope you all remembered to bring your jackets\u201D, my German teacher joked.\
  \ I realized that she had also been serious as we had an entire voyage planned to\
  \ go to the top of one of the mountains. The first step onto the grey rocky terrain\
  \ had been unlike anything I had experienced in my life.\n It immediately felt as\
  \ though someone had tampered with the thermometer and sent the temperature plummeting\
  \ down. The city of Innsbruck had easily been at least eighty degrees fahrenheit,\
  \ how had this been possible? As we followed our German teacher, everyone began\
  \ to realize that jackets were a necessity as a person could easily freeze at night.\
  \ Glistening snow capped the mountain tops of what appeared to be barren land. This\
  \ had just been the beginning, and we were going to climb to the top of one of the\
  \ mountain peaks ourselfs. Several minutes into the voyage, we found it difficult\
  \ to breathe. If had been similar to walking into a freezer. As we were walking,\
  \ something in the distance caught my eye. It had been a miniature green plant.\
  \ I could hardly believe it, how had anything been capable of growing up in those\
  \ tremendous heights? I observed as I approached it that it had small white \u201C\
  hairs\u201D.  Looking back on this moment now, I realize that I should not have\
  \ touched it but my curiosity persuaded me. What felt like soft leather during the\
  \ first few moments felt as though it turned to fire the next. Apparently this weed\
  \ had been a called \u201Cmetal\u201D. I knew of this because of rumors I have heard.\
  \ The oils of the plant irritate bare skin. It had not been too painful as it gradually\
  \ subsided but in those moments I discovered that even those kinds of defensive\
  \ plants can grow at high altitudes.We eventually found an open area at the mountain\
  \ top that tourists could stop by to visit. I had not been prepared for what I had\
  \ been about to discover next.\n\tWe were so high up that even some of the clouds\
  \ were below us, and they occasionally gave way to give us an astonishing birds\
  \ eye view of Innsbruck. Everyone in our group began to take pictures quickly. However\
  \ my instincts told me to be patient. Little did I know that patience would pay\
  \ off. There were numerous black ravens flying about and as I focused my camera\
  \ down on the city, one of the ravens accidently flew in mid picture. What made\
  \ it so unique is that the camera caught it in action mid flapping position as it\
  \ brought its wings above its head. Some of the clouds even had an exact outline\
  \ of the bird as it flew. To this day, that has been the most beautiful picture\
  \ I have ever taken and I would not change any details.\n\tIt goes without saying\
  \ that discovering Austria is more than its cities. Sometimes people have to venture\
  \ into the unknown and to a foreigner such as myself to that country, I could not\
  \ have been more culture shocked."
