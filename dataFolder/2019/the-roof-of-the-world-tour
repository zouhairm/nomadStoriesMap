Text: "It is still a mystery to me why the armoured car was turquoise blue with white\
  \ fluffy clouds painted on it, equally surprising that underneath it was based on\
  \ a Land Rover Defender 110 just like my own but these are the thoughts that drift\
  \ through my mind as I wait once again for my escort to exchange hugs and tea with\
  \ another police station on the road from Quetta in Pakistan to Iran.  The tea is\
  \ good, sweet with no milk and I have come to enjoy it, the fact that the constant\
  \ stops for tea are extending a drive that could take a day into a three day adventure\
  \ in Islamic culture can be seen as a good thing - it will be done when God wills\
  \ is now my mindfulness mantra.  People at home in Scotland pay for mindfulness\
  \ courses, here in Balochstan province you get it thrown in with the free police\
  \ escort, or you get impatient and rude as I have seen some German travellers react,\
  \ I prefer my way smile and take the tea, live in the moment.\n\nI have time, over\
  \ tea, to reflect on six months of travelling, from Turkey through Iran all of the\
  \ \"stans\", Mongolia, Pakistan, India and Nepal.  The biggest surprise of the trip\
  \ was the amazing friendliness of the people of Iran, having the good fortune to\
  \ pick up some hitchhikers from Iran in Turkey, and take them home to Terhan meant\
  \ that every place I visited in Iran I was looked after by their friends and saw\
  \ a side of real life that travellers rarely see.  As my truck restarts I am still\
  \ amazed that the 20 year old Land Rover has made it over 50 thousand kilometers\
  \ including the 4600m passes on the Pamir and Karakhorm highways and the desolation\
  \ of the Gobi desert, the latter was a close shave as I lost all the oil from the\
  \ engine 200km from the nearest town and 170km from the nearest road.  Thankfully\
  \ my supply of spares and tools was up to the job and we limped out of the desert\
  \ on a mixture of spare engine, gearbox and differential oil just about keeping\
  \ the engine lubricated.\n\nIt was an amazing life experience and just the way to\
  \ start an early retirement after a busy corporate life, I was encouraged to retire\
  \ after surviving two significant cancer experiences which have left me with a new\
  \ immune system after a transplant and the death of three close friends in a year,\
  \ as God Wills they would say in Isalm, in my case I took it as God \"tapping me\
  \ on the shoulder\" and reminding me of my mortality.  \n\nMy grandmother used to\
  \ say \"think of your life as a book Gerry, and then think what would you like the\
  \ next chapter to look like if it was a book\" . I think I have lived up to her\
  \ aspirations with this trip."
