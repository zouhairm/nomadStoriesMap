Text: "My first moments in Europe found me standing in the Madrid airport with two\
  \ huge suitcases, a pair of heels that were killing me softly, and the inability\
  \ to read a damn thing. Promising, right?\n\nThis wasn\u2019t how I planned to end\
  \ the year 2013. Back home in New Orleans, I had a job, a boyfriend, and a five-year\
  \ plan. Then in one day, two of those things were gone. The third one got scrapped\
  \ by default. I\u2019m not one to react to sudden changes in ways that would be\
  \ described as \u2018normal\u2019 or \u2018reasonable\u2019, so of course, my coping\
  \ mechanism was to apply for a student program in Spain. I thought the idea was\
  \ doomed from the start. Why? Because I did everything at the last minute. I even\
  \ mailed the application on the last day possible! I left the post office laughing\
  \ because I figured there was no way in Hell I\u2019d actually get in... but I did\
  \ (whoops). That\u2019s the thing about rash decisions: sometimes you just might\
  \ have to follow through. \n\nEndless paperwork, a visa approval, and several flights\
  \ later, I had arrived! In one month I set up a new phone, found a room, and opened\
  \ a bank account, which is impressive for someone with two semesters of Spanish\
  \ who can barely read or speak. I could practice Spanish every day, but that\u2019\
  s easy when almost no one in your neighborhood, or at your job, knows your language.\
  \ Finally after three months, I got a break: Easter holidays were coming and, of\
  \ course, I couldn\u2019t wait to travel. (Plus my contract was only for six months,\
  \ please believe I was going somewhere.)\n\n\nI decided on two cities in Spain:\
  \ Granada and M\xE1laga. Now, I know what you\u2019re thinking. You\u2019re thinking:\
  \ \u201CKhephra, why these cities? Were you entranced by the history of La Alhambra\
  \ de Granada? Did your love of art lure you to the home of Picasso?\u201D Trust\
  \ me, dear reader, I would love to say: \u201CBut of course! I was well read, cultured,\
  \ and had totally heard of La Alhambra!\u201D but my actual answer is: Hell no!\
  \ I chose these cities because they were cheap, with a large selection of available\
  \ rooms. Look, budget constraints are mighty and the struggle is real. \n\nI packed\
  \ my bag and set off. Was I scared? Absolutely! But who cares? I was in Spain: a\
  \ country I had only seen in my dreams. It looked great in pictures so I was bound\
  \ to enjoy them in reality. \n\nAnd enjoy them I did. In Granada I wandered for\
  \ hours, taking pictures, eating amazing food, and meeting people from around the\
  \ world. I lost myself in La Alhambra (no really, I got lost in the gardens. It\
  \ took me over an hour to find the exit.). I met a few locals and had so much fun\
  \ [and wine] that I missed the first night of Easter processions. The whole time\
  \ there I couldn\u2019t shake this feeling that I had once in Madrid. That I\u2019\
  d seen these buildings and streets before. It happened again in M\xE0laga. I didn\u2019\
  t get lost but every time I turned a new corner, I expected to see something from\
  \ home. The terraces, the architecture, I recognized things everywhere I went. Then\
  \ it hit me: I was in New Orleans. \n\nNow I know how that sounds but bear with\
  \ me. There are things you expect to find in Spain - paella, flamenco, bulls chillin'\
  \ in the streets, you name it (that last one isn\u2019t true). I also expected language\
  \ barriers, loneliness, and loads of tears. But what I didn\u2019t expect to find\
  \ were so many reminders of home on another continent. In New Orleans, we learn\
  \ all about our history with France but the Spanish influence is sometimes reduced\
  \ to a footnote. So to stand in an actual Spanish plaza and realize you\u2019re\
  \ in the country that built your home town, is almost overwhelming. On the way back\
  \ to Madrid, I knew that I\u2019d found something else: a purpose. I left New Orleans\
  \ looking for adventure and a change of pace. In Spain, I found something I didn\u2019\
  t even know I was looking for: My new home."
