Text: "Do you want to go to Barrow? Simple question.  Simple answer was sure! \nI\
  \ didn't admit that I had never heard of Barrow, had no idea where it was, knew\
  \ nothing about Barrow, but I was up  for it. \nThree weeks  later, I think I see\
  \ it. Yes, there is the airport - only strip of asphalt showing up in a wonderland\
  \ of white everywhere. The fields were covered in glittering snow crystals, the\
  \ multicolored homes were surrounded by white snowbanks, the  whole city sitting\
  \ on the edge of the frozen snow-covered Chukchi Sea, nothing but white standing\
  \ out, except for the red door of the airport hanger owned by Ravn Airways.\nWe\
  \ did two 360 degree circles to lose altitude and in we went, landing on Rwy. 07\
  \ in my friend's privately-owned Bonanza.  Lots of people don't make it due to cold,\
  \ inclement weather or fog, but here we were, ready to explore.\nBarrow is the northernmost\
  \ city in the United States, a fascinating Inupiat community composed ot 60% native\
  \ and 40% others, including Fijians, Samoans, Hawaiians, Koreans, Filipinos, and\
  \ Serbians,  with the native population declining due to intermarriage. Koreans\
  \ own 7 of the 10 restaurants in town. There are three main grocery stores in Barrow\
  \ (now renamed Utqiagvik) and one Quik-Mart, and the prices are high in all of them,\
  \ because all food and supplies have to be flown in, except for a few weeks in the\
  \ summer when the ice melts on the Chukchi Sea. There are no roads connecting Barrow\
  \ to the other seven communities on the North Slope.\nLife is rugged in Barrow.\
  \ The night we were there, in April,  it was -31 degrees Celcius but it gets much\
  \ colder in the dead of winter. The homes must be built on pilings or post supports,\
  \ so as to  protect the  permafrost, and also to allow the snow to blow through\
  \ under the houses. If you don't build on pilings, you cannot connect to city water\
  \ and sewer, as the house may buckle or bend causing breakage of the supply pipes.\
  \ Because polar bears sometimes wander into town, children are not allowed to play\
  \ outside without an adult present. \nFor heating, the community is reliant on oil\
  \ and there are several huge storage containers at the edge of town. For communication,\
  \ there is a bank of satellite dishes bringing TV and internet. The dishes are at\
  \ an angle of only one degree to the horizon because of Barrow's northern location.\
  \ Any dishes angled more up or down are broken. Not far from the dishes are two\
  \ large cemeteries with wooden crosses, as concrete would crumble in the harsh climate\
  \ and changes in temperature. \nThe locals continue whale hunting with two major\
  \ whale hunts per year. For the spring whale hunt, the Inupiat use traditional skin\
  \ boats and harpoons. The best skin to use is from the bearded seal or ogorook,\
  \ as the skin is durable and pliable, and lasts about 8 years. The men go out 6\
  \ to a boat, with the captain getting first choice of parts. \nHeading north down\
  \ a dirt road, you will come to \"The Top of the World\", where tourists like to\
  \ have photos taken. Access is restricted to Inupiats, on penalty of a $1500 fine\
  \ to anyone else who goes down this road (as of 2015). \nThe tiny spit of land leading\
  \ to Point Barrow separates the Chukchi and Beaufort Seas, which are collectively\
  \ known as the Arctic Ocean. Along this spit is the infamous Pigniq or Duck Camp.\
  \ Natives live here all summer in tents or shelters, without water or sewer, in\
  \ order to shoot the Steller's eider ducks on their migration between these seas.\
  \ The camp is jokingly referred to as the \"Hamptons of the North\".\nIf you make\
  \ it up  there, be sure to see the famous milepost in town and the Cathy Parker\
  \ artificial blue and gold turf field of the  Barrow Whalers football team. \nFar\
  \ too soon, it was back to the airport, and southbound towards Washington State.\
  \  I am glad I said yes, headed for Barrow, and learned much about life in the northern\
  \ Alaska."
