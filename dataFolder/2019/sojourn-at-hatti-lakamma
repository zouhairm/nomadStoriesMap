Text: "I woke up before the sun peeped into my window, the mild morning breeze brushing\
  \ against my hair. I was all set by 7 in the morning to visit Hatti Lakamma Temple,\
  \ an old temple in a small town called Yediyur, located in Tumkur district in Karnataka,\
  \ India. I wanted to visit the temple to pray for a PhD seat, which I had vehemently\
  \ been after since 2015.\n\nI heard the honking of my friend\u2019s bike on the\
  \ street, as I was putting on my leather jacket and boots, and quickly poring over\
  \ a map of Karnataka. \u201CRrrrrmmm, rrrmmmmm!!\u201D and off we headed out to\
  \ our destination on the Avenger motorcycle. Although it was quite pleasant in Bangalore,\
  \ my hometown, by the time we reached the temple it was scorching hot. All around\
  \ dotting the landscape were thatched huts, dirt roads lined with cow dung, cows\
  \ and street dogs. \u201COh, no! This looks like a very boring place,\u201D I complained\
  \ to my friend before we entered the temple premises. In response to my complaint,\
  \ he said, \u201CWell, let\u2019s see what the Goddess has in store for us.\u201D\
  \ I was barely enthusiastic because I usually find temples and rituals pointless.\
  \ Little did I know what the Goddess had under her hat. As we made our way through\
  \ the entrance, we saw sculptures awash in azure blue, golden yellow and light green.\
  \ We put our hands together and prayed for a minute in front of the idol of the\
  \ gorgeously decorated Goddess. I felt a sense of the \u2018transpersonal\u2019\
  \ \u2013 there was an element of mysticism which I couldn\u2019t decipher. Yet,\
  \ this feeling persisted and I felt like I was in a time machine, travelling back\
  \ to Ancient India, with a sense of inexact poignancy. Perhaps I was merely vibing\
  \ and resonating with the vibes of the temple. It was all heimlich: familiar and\
  \ yet strange. My friend transported me back to the present by tapping on my shoulder.\
  \ Observing a middle-aged man, he said, \u201CHe appears to be an astrologer. People\
  \ are consulting him for something.\u201D I was enticed by the suggestion and we\
  \ approached the man. I asked him in Kannada if he can fortell the future. In Kannada\
  \ we call it \u201CShastra\u201D. He nodded and told me to sit down and give him\
  \ some bananas and a hundred rupees. I hurriedly got the fruit and fished out a\
  \ hundred rupee note from my jeans pocket. The man lit an incense stick, chanted\
  \ a mantra and voila! His body posture changed and he started burping. Moments later,\
  \ I realized that he had gone into a trance state. \u201CI know you are here to\
  \ enquire about your higher studies. Believe me and trust me, the Goddess speaks.\u201D\
  \ Taking on the persona of Goddess, he said: \u201CI will have your back and make\
  \ sure you get a PhD seat. You will get a PhD seat in a place in Bangalore, a place\
  \ that you have already seen.\u201D I was baffled and awed at the man\u2019s words.\
  \ I thanked him whole-heartedly and my friend and I continued to explore the temple.\
  \ Colourful and mysterious, with an old-world charm, we were amazed at the dense\
  \ population of devotees at the temple.\n\nAnd so in 2018, I got into a university\
  \ in Bangalore, one that I had already seen \u2013 Jain University. Upon matriculation,\
  \ science took over the place of the temple\u2019s mysticism. On 25th January this\
  \ year, the day of my birthday, I received the Best Student Award from the Pro-Vice-Chancellor\
  \ of Jain University in my very first semester. What a marvelous journey from Hatti\
  \ Lakamma Temple to Jain University: from trance to transpersonal psychology!"
