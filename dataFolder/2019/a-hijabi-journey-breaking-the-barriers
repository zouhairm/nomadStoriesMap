Text: "Cold air softly touched my skin as I arrived at Ataturk Airport in the end\
  \ of October. I was at one of the international airport of Istanbul that is in Europe\
  \ side alone by myself. As a hijab woman, it\u2019s never been easy to travel alone.\
  \ Being a solo female traveler has been hard by some people and now I put a Hijab\
  \ on. But, I made it many times.\n\nThe temperature got warmer since I stepped on\
  \ my feet in immigration queue. Long wait of Immigration queue had given an early\
  \ welcome for me. It was the longest time to get checked by the immigration staff\
  \ in my whole entire life. In the midst of boredom, I heard the sound of a Caucasian\
  \ tourist and his friends playing the guitar to dilute the atmosphere. Many people\
  \ turned their faces to where this sound came from. However, seriousness seemed\
  \ to win the atmosphere. Not long after that, the sound of music and happiness turned\
  \ into silence.\n\nImmigration checks took longer than I thought. I didn't know\
  \ why, but the WiFi didn\u2019t  work at this airport, or maybe just my phone couldn't\
  \ be connected. What I was worried about was really happening. My friend, Sevval,\
  \ had been waiting for more than an hour. That was our first time meeting. I knew\
  \ her from a friend of mine and I didn\u2019t want to ruin her first impression\
  \ with this situation. \n\nIt seemed the problem of waiting didn't stop there. The\
  \ suitcase I carried was badly damaged. I finally went to airport staff to ask a\
  \ new suitcase. But, it was frustrating. He couldn\u2019t speak English. What a\
  \ surprise! I mean he was working at the international airport of a city frequented\
  \ by everyone in the world. So, I decided to go to lost and found center to ask\
  \ whether or not I could get a new suitcase. A very long procedure made me even\
  \ more uncomfortable with Sevval for waiting me that long.\n\nFrom inside the arrival\
  \ gate, I could see a Turkish girl with her worried face waiting. Sevval called\
  \ my name. I was very relieved to finally be able to say sorry. Because I could\
  \ not connect with WiFi, I could not contact her via whats app and he was forced\
  \ to send me a message via sms which was expensive.\n\nIn a country where not everyone\
  \ could speak English, it\u2019s imperative for me to have an internet package to\
  \ make my life easier. So, I asked Sevval to help me buy the internet package on\
  \ the way to the bus station. Her job finished to take me from the airport to the\
  \ bus station. A friendly tradition from Turkey, they treat their guests to eat.\
  \ So did Sevval, she bought me simit (turkey bread), sandwiches and juice. In my\
  \ native country, Indonesia, we also have a tradition of bringing gifts that will\
  \ be given to our hosts. I gave Sevval a typical shrimp cracker from Indonesia and\
  \ also Indomie which was quite famous.\n\nNot all information on the internet is\
  \ correct. My night trip from Istanbul to Bursa lasted longer than the information\
  \ I searched on the internet. I departed from Istanbul at 9.15 pm and I arrived\
  \ in Bursa at 1.50 am. It was a pretty scary trip for a solo traveler like me. The\
  \ internet package that I bought could not be used until the next day, no one could\
  \ speak English on the bus except a Chinese woman who also had difficulty communicating\
  \ like me. Fortunately, I've experienced exactly the same thing when in Thailand,\
  \ without internet and didn't know when to stop. Luckily, in the middle of the trip,\
  \ there was a woman who would go to Bursa and could speak English. When I arrived\
  \ in Bursa, the atmosphere was very quiet even there were no taxis. Moreover, the\
  \ distance from the bus station to my hotel which was in the center of city was\
  \ quite far away. Finally I hitched someone who also headed to the center of the\
  \ city. What a gambling situation! Being a solo hijab traveler has never been easy\
  \ for me. But here I am telling you about my story."
