Text: "It was autumn, 2018, we made a family trip to this place called yercaud in\
  \ Tamil Nadu. This place was a hill station and knowing my family for 23 years,\
  \ I knew it was going to be the same as all other holidays. In the hotel, good food\
  \ and back home. But this time it was different. A week at Yercaud and my heart\
  \ didn't want to leave this place. It's still there! This place doesn't have much\
  \ to offer in terms of sightseeing or adventure. But there is a man and he owns\
  \ a beautiful hotel. The Regent Hill Side Villa&Hotel! His name is Vishu Kalliappa.\
  \ \nA man straight out of my imagination, found in my reality. He's everything and\
  \ when I say everything, I mean he's a storyteller, a poet, an author, an artist,\
  \ A lepidopterist, an animal lover! Oh before I forget! His best friend is Carpet!\
  \ And carpet is a dog, a small little shitzu. This wonderland he owns is one place\
  \ of dreams for any animal, nature and peace lovers. We couldn't stay at the Regent\
  \ Hill Side, we discovered the place upon reaching there. 700 words aren't enough\
  \ to describe him or the heaven he owns. His name is all over Yercaud and and yes!\
  \ Ones are paleophiles. He has something tremendous for you. If one had to find\
  \ humbleness as a person. COME TO YERCAUD! \n\nThis trip was an eye opener and an\
  \ inspiration. Mr.Vishu Kalliappa is the heart of Yercaud. Meeting him and interacting\
  \ with him is a feeling like...going to school only for your favorite teacher changing\
  \ a dry boring chapter into something which embarks a story of love in your heart.\
  \ \n\nP.S: His chicken curry and Dosa is a feast and he's an amazing chef!"
