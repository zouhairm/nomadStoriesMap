Text: "\"My phone flashes with a message, \u201CIf there is a chance of the lights\
  \ tomorrow, my mom said she'd give us a ride.\u201D \nThat\xB4s what Jhoanne sent\
  \ me, without even realizing the joy she would bring me. A few hours later, we were\
  \ in the car with Osta \u2013that\xB4s my new Norwegian friend\xB4s mom- driving\
  \ down the 862\xB4s road to Kattfjordeidet, the full moon chasing us into the night.\n\
  Although not always necessary, it is recommended to get away from light pollution\
  \ to see the lights in action- the less light to compete, the more chance of seeing\
  \ the Northern light's brilliance. With every turn, my expectations grow. \nThe\
  \ clear night invites me to dream. The asphalt weaves its way between mounds of\
  \ snow. There is no side of the road. Jhoanne is telling a story about Vikings,\
  \ and their prohibition on saying hello to the northern lights, as in their culture\
  \ the lights are souls that travels to the world of the dead.\nWe are leaving Tromso,\
  \ between mountains covered in white, when the cars stops. I\xB4m touching the ice\
  \ with my boots, I take my coat, wrapping myself against the cold and step outside\
  \ of the car's warmth. It\xB4s so cold that I've lost count of how freezing can\
  \ our atmosphere get. Already, I can feel the chill seeping into my feet, it\xB4\
  s like the minutes are swinging by in front of me.\nI look to the sky and suddenly,\
  \ I am on my knees. It\xB4s impossible to capture the whole sight with my eyes.\
  \ It\xB4s raining green light, like someone is painting the sky. Little by little,\
  \ other colors begin to show, joining our visual party, purple and magenta are welcome\
  \ too.\nI\xB4m still on my knees, on the snow,paralyzed, amazed. It\xB4s like Medusa\xB4\
  s story, they say once you look at her, you can\xB4t escape her magic.\nOver and\
  \ over again I sigh, my breath creating a small fog in the crisp air. I\xB4m amazed,\
  \ I\xB4m excited, I\xB4m moved. For so long, I have waited and dreamt of these lights.\
  \ I wanted to see them with all my heart. And here I am. And here we are, me and\
  \ them. We kiss in the distance. We touch. They are inside me, and in this moment\
  \ I feel as if I could take them with me forever.\nThis moment, with the lights\
  \ dancing across the sky, will be hanging in my eyes for all my life.\nTime stops,\
  \ and I stand there, in that doorway to fantasy. Just right there. In the line that\
  \ divides the possible and the impossible, the real and the unreal. If I had a shelf\
  \ for the majestic moments of my life, this night would have a place in it. \nThis\
  \ night pushed me to believe, once more, that the impossible is possible, that every\
  \ dream can be true. There are no words to describe what can happen when the dark\
  \ and the lights from the sun became one, in The Arctic Circle. The sun, standing\
  \ in some remote place of the Universe, shooting magic with his wand."
