Text: "The first time I tried to stand in the ocean, I did a backwards somersault.\
  \ The second time I tried, I got salt up my nose.\n\nEvery time I endeavored to\
  \ wade in, the water would spit me right back out.\n\nThis was not the greeting\
  \ I expected from the Pacific.\n\nAs I lay where the ocean left me, my heart folded\
  \ in fear. I had imagined running up to a surfer in my sports bra, borrowing his\
  \ board and riding a couple of waves before flipping my salt-filled hair and jogging\
  \ back up the shore, but now I shivered with the challenge that was truly before\
  \ me.\n\nI watched more experienced surfers dive under the towering waves or glide\
  \ over the top of them and realized I would need a surf master to show me the way.\n\
  \nSo my partner, Trevor, and I called up Esteban. A Costa Rican surfing god who\
  \ showed up in a Volkswagen Jetta with two surfboards strapped to the top and a\
  \ trunk load of wet suits.\n\nAs he stepped out of his car drinking kombucha with\
  \ his honey tan chest bare over a wet suit, I understood why people pay $100/hr\
  \ for this.\n\nThis sport was not made for an average Mid Westerner. As I squeezed\
  \ my thigh-fat into the tight rubber one-piece, I immediately started sweating,\
  \ which of course made the rubber stick and even more difficult to pull up over\
  \ my body. \n\n\u201CTake your time,\u201D Esteban said as he laughed, \u201CGetting\
  \ a wet suit on might be the hardest part.\u201D\n\nOnce it was over my hips, Esteban\
  \ led us from the parking lot to the beach.\n\nWe had to practice popping up with\
  \ our boards anchored in the sand before we got to go in the water. \n\n\u201CLike\
  \ this,\u201D Esteban said as he demonstrated lying down on his stomach on the board\
  \ to jumping up into a low surfing position in one motion. \n\nBut by the sixth\
  \ or seventh time he said, \u201CAgain!\u201D I was starting to despair. \n\n\u201C\
  Faster! You are going to need to pop up much faster,\u201D he said.\n\nI kept practicing.\
  \ Paddle, paddle, paddle. Chest up, palms flat, toes curled. Then, pop up with my\
  \ front leg between my hands and back leg bent.\n\nAfter some time, we walked out\
  \ into the ocean until the water was about waist deep. A wave of decent size approached.\n\
  \nAs it crested and broke, a rush of white water pushed toward the shore. Esteban\
  \ pushed my board forward as the white water reached us and yelled \u201CPop up!\u201D\
  \n\nWith the white water on my heels, I jumped up into the surfing position. For\
  \ one second I really thought I had it, but I quickly realized my feet were off\
  \ center and the board flipped over, launching me into the ocean as the wave passed\
  \ over my head.\n\n\u201CAgain!\u201D my surf master yelled. Again and again.\n\n\
  As I popped up for what felt like the twentieth time before falling into the water,\
  \ I wondered if my dream of riding a wave would ever come true.\n\nEsteban measured\
  \ the time from the sun sinking toward the horizon and said, \u201CAlright, let\u2019\
  s try this more time.\u201D\n\nI got back into position and took a deep breath,\
  \ willing my tired limbs to follow instructions one last time. As the white water\
  \ began pushing my board forward, I pushed up against it and popped up on my board.\
  \ My feet were miraculously centered and I rode the wave in until the sand rubbed\
  \ my board\u2019s fin. I fell into the receding water and laughed.\n\nI thought\
  \ of all those tiny people dotting the waves at beaches stretching from San Diego\
  \ to Los Angeles. They dance in the space where two worlds collide: the water from\
  \ the deep and the rock from the land.\n\nWhile I was nowhere near good at surfing,\
  \ I had ridden a wave off the coast of California.\n\nAnd now I can say the last\
  \ time I stood in the ocean, I was on top of a wave."
