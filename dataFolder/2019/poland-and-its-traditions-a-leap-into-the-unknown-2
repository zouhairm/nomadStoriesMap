Text: "Bread, salt, and vodka. These are the essential elements of the welcome ritual\
  \ to Poland. I remember that my arrival in the country which for a time was my home\
  \ had the flavor of a piece of bread sprinkled with salt, and accompanied by a bitter\
  \ sip of vodka that burned my throat. Over time, I understood that this tradition\
  \ reflects the welcoming spirit of the country; that offers food to the newcomer\
  \ and that their celebrations are measured with countless shots. That welcome was\
  \ also accompanied by a plate of traditional food, which we thanked after more than\
  \ 6 hours of travel, and a warm welcome from the people with whom I would work,\
  \ and who would become family for a whole year.\n\nI arrived in Poland with a couple\
  \ of suitcases, all my work equipment, and I must admit that a little fear. The\
  \ first cultural shock I had when I decided to move to Poland was while preparing\
  \ the papers, and in the Spanish Health office, I was asked if Poland belonged to\
  \ the European Union. At that moment, for me, it seemed a question a bit dumb since\
  \ I grew up repeating the countries of the European Union and their capitals for\
  \ years in school. After a while living there, I discovered that that question showed\
  \ the ignorance of many people about Poland and its traditions. They even have a\
  \ misguided idea of a closed and unwelcoming population. Dragging these prejudices,\
  \ I would never have imagined I could adapt so easily to a Slavic country and its\
  \ way of life and its customs.\n\nI still remember that I took the piece of bread\
  \ and dunked it in the salt with some distrust. That was the first ritual of many\
  \ others. During that year and even later when I returned, I discovered so many\
  \ other traditions. Poland is a place that is deeply rooted in religion. That is\
  \ why Christmas becomes so important to share with loved ones. So, just before starting\
  \ the Christmas Eve dinner, a piece of wafer is exchanged along with the best wishes.\
  \ Although I have to say that my favorite was the Fat Thursday. That day, just before\
  \ Ash Wednesday and the beginning of Lent, everybody has to eat P\u0105czek (a kind\
  \ of stuffed donut). One of the images that I remember most clearly, it was walking\
  \ through the cemetery on All Saints' Day. This day is especially spectacular in\
  \ Poland. It is an annual holiday on November 1, when millions of Poles gather in\
  \ local cemeteries to commemorate their loved ones by placing flowers and candles\
  \ in their graves. A whole light show. For me, the cemeteries were always a place\
  \ of peace and tranquility, and I still remember that feeling and the warm rain\
  \ that accompanied us that night.\n\nThe importance of being part of all these things,\
  \ of living those traditions from within, both as a spectator and as part of them,\
  \ gave me the possibility of creating such a special bond with the place. The unknown\
  \ polish traditions have become part of me, of my memories and of what I am now.\
  \ I still smile when I remember my face of disbelief after that emotional reception.\
  \ A place is known when its traditions are understood, and even more so when they\
  \ are lived closely. Even vodka became natural and no longer stung in the throat."
