Text: "I had heard many things about Kigali and its warming people. At their heart\
  \ is the significance of their history which. Perhaps, it is the same way Parisians\
  \ now regard the Catacombs, Kigalians too regard their Genocide Memorial commemorating\
  \ the 1994 ethnic war with victims over 800,000. \nWhile I was having my first impressions\
  \ about Kigali in a cab on the way to Kigali Photography Centre, my, cab driver,\
  \ Japheth, entered into my monologue uninvited. But it was welcomed because he had\
  \ an interesting take on pan-Africanism. It\u2019s affecting when I see ordinary\
  \ people with noble ideas. \nHe said they are trying to make Rwanda just Rwanda\
  \ not Europe. Their development, he beat his chest, will be a thing to attract Europeans,\
  \ not the other way around. I was touched by his sense of pride. A lot of Rwandans\
  \ are optimistic about their country, the future of their country. He directed me\
  \ to the Kigali City Market to try it out when I exchanged ideas further with him\
  \ if I wanted to feel the real pulse of Kigalians and took it down in my notepad.\
  \ But instead I first visited the Kimironko market not far from the neighbourhood\
  \ I stayed. \nThe market was almost too orderly. You know, when you think of the\
  \ markets in Nigeria, take Oshodi for instance, it\u2019s always chaotic and disorderly\
  \ despite all effort to bring order into it. As I was saying all these down in my\
  \ notepad at the market\u2019s entrance, a man approached me for alms. But I declined.\
  \ \nBefore I knew it, I had been surrounded by curious onlookers and traders at\
  \ the market. It started with a girl who tapped her colleagues to look at me. Then\
  \ they crowded me. They touched me, touched my hair, examined every inch of my body.\
  \ My ID read I was on a road trip from Lagos and not a journalist, I told a boy\
  \ who spoke little English who had the impression I was a journalist. \nI thought\
  \ I had seemed to the people who crowded like some exotic species. Another young\
  \ man pushed forward his hand for a handshake. I received it. He introduced himself\
  \ that he sold fabric and owned a curio shop. He led me through a labyrinth of many\
  \ stalls. Curiously, he asked about my age on the way. I didn\u2019t know whether\
  \ it\u2019s to feel the gap of silence between us. I told him I was 27. He said\
  \ he was 26 and laughed that we were of the same age group. \nHe stopped abruptly\
  \ in a fabric section of the market owned by a fairly old man. He showed me around\
  \ different wears and design the fabrics had been made into. That\u2019s when I\
  \ confirmed my suspicion. He\u2019s just one those hustlers at the market who source\
  \ customers for traders for a commission. He showed me a jacket sown in Ankara fabric.\
  \ The price was 15,000 last. Nothing more, nothing less. I tried negotiating it\
  \ down, but the man wouldn\u2019t bulge. He felt deflated when I left but bid me\
  \ goodbye. \nThen I went to the market Japhet recommended earlier. The market was\
  \ bustling with life when I got there. There were some persons who were offloading\
  \ goods from trucks. The weight they lifted on their shoulders was staggering. \n\
  I went in the direction of a shopping plaza where I bought some items for my loved\
  \ ones. Unfortunately, I was charged twice for the items. I used my MasterCard on\
  \ their POS. The first attempt just went blank with no receipt of transaction. I\
  \ was urged to try it again so I did. I had been captured in a conversation about\
  \ the possibility of meeting Nigerian traders in the city \u2013 I wasn\u2019t paying\
  \ attention to the transaction. After the second attempt and the same result again,\
  \ I refused to try it once again. The lady told me to wait so she can call someone\
  \ to verify if the transaction had gone through. After several minutes, she said\
  \ it had and handed me the items. Unknowing to me I had been debited twice. It was\
  \ when I opened my email later after I\u2019d left the city that I knew."
