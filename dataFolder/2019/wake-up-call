Text: "There I was sitting on a lounge chair soaking up the Cape May coast on the\
  \ last days of August. Its ninety degrees out, the intense heat is felt even under\
  \ the shade of a blue beach umbrella. The ocean breeze, feeling less like a refreshing\
  \ reprieve and more like the breath of a dragon; I enjoy every smoldering second.\
  \ \n\nI set my things on my chair and prepare to face the blazing sun. I step out\
  \ from the shadows and towards the shimmer on the horizon.  With each step I take\
  \ closer to the surf, the more excited I become; the little boy within has come\
  \ alive and he is ready. \nI get to the edge and a wave crashes onto my feet and\
  \ suddenly I feel a chill through my spine. The whiplash of sensation leaves me\
  \ motionless, wondering how best to enter the cold embrace of the sea. Lost in thought,\
  \ a bigger wave removes the choice and knocks me off balance. The chilly greeting\
  \ invigorates me and I get up off the wet sand and charge towards the ocean as if\
  \ going into battle. \n\nAs I float weightlessly, I feel the sun warming me from\
  \ above; the ocean cooling me from below; I cant help but think back a week prior\
  \ when I had fallen prey to an assault. I wasn't hurt but I felt violated and angry.\
  \ My bubble of safety had been penetrated and seemingly innocuous choices throughout\
  \ that day had led me to a troubled soul and six blows to the left side of my face.\
  \ I was lucky the confrontation only left me with a bit of swelling and bruising.\
  \ I am grateful that as uncomfortable and infuriating the situation was it put things\
  \ into perspective. I needed to recharge.\nI kept putting self-care on the back\
  \ burner but this particular week was different I chose to take action. I wanted\
  \ to see lighthouses and dolphins but more importantly take some personal time.\
  \ So this particular week was different, I made reservations at a hotel conveniently\
  \ located across the street from the beach, packed my bags, and set off in my Red\
  \ Camaro for a two hour and thirty-seven minute drive for a much needed getaway.\
  \ \n\nAs if right on cue a wave knocks me out of my state of reflection and its\
  \ time to head back to the hotel and get ready for dinner. The sun is setting and\
  \ the once scorching heat has waned to that of a warm embrace. The restaurant is\
  \ half-mile away from my hotel and its time to put on my shoes and get going. I\
  \ start my trek and it's a beautiful clear night and the sound of music and people\
  \ enjoying their summer night fill the streets. I\u2019m entertained and despite\
  \ taking this trip by myself I don't feel alone. I finally reach my destination\
  \ and convince myself I won\u2019t eat in excess but I succumb to the siren call\
  \ of shrimp, pasta and bread. I didn't regret it. \n\nI would stay two more days.\
  \ Within that time I would climb up a lighthouse and get a birds eye view of the\
  \ cape, visit a WWII fire tower, sneaked a peak at a shuttered bunker, engorged\
  \ myself with all you can eat crab, and most exciting see a pod of dolphins up close.\
  \ It was hot, I ended up getting a sunburn and got a few more bumps and bruises\
  \ during my adventure but more importantly I took the time to refresh and reenergize;\
  \ looking forward to new adventures."
