Text: "Our Portuguese Way \n \nMy partner and I decided to celebrate 25 years of adventuring\
  \ together by walking the Camino de Sanitago the Portuguese Way. Our journey started\
  \ from our home in New Zealand, but our pilgrimage started amongst boats and nets\
  \ and coloured floats in the small fishing town of Agudela, just outside Porto.\
  \ For 14 days we took a leap of faith into the unknown following yellow arrows,\
  \ scallop shell markers and ancient stone crosses up the Portuguese coast, and inland\
  \ through the Galician region of Spain. \nThe pilgrims we met along the way generally\
  \ fell into two categories: spiritual or adventurous. We were there for the adventure,\
  \ however a huge part of the 280 km trek was undeniably religious. We called into\
  \ every church that was open, from imposing cathedrals adorned and gilded in Baroque\
  \ style, to homely village chapels decorated with flowers from parishioner\u2019\
  s gardens.\nWalking on a Sunday meant priests were at their posts. With the smell\
  \ of incense in the air, we were taken into dark vestries to have our pilgrim\u2019\
  s book stamped. Behind the scenes we were treated to the treasures of the parish,\
  \ golden chalices, vestments and artwork dating back centuries. The antiquities\
  \ were a constant reminder that we were walking an ancient path, one travelled since\
  \ medieval times, when Brueghel-esk figures, most likely with blisters, had similar\
  \ conversations about the friendliest Albergues, and the most comfortable beds,\
  \ the freshest fish, and best local wines. \nMost mornings we passed a group of\
  \ Australian ladies who\u2019s guide regularly got them lost, we spent two of days\
  \ discussing Trump politics with a couple from Colorado, and one afternoon we sung\
  \ a few Abba songs alongside an Italian opera singer. We met our favourite pilgrim\
  \ while bobbing around in a steaming mineral pool, a witty German woman, with grey\
  \ hair pulled back into a bun, a string of pearls and the ability to laugh with\
  \ a flip top head. When she found out we were kiwis she asked \u201CWhat the f#@!\
  \ are you doing here!\u201D We talked about the issues of the world for hours, leaving\
  \ the pool with wrinkly skin and a new friend. \nUnder big blue skies we rambled\
  \ through lush market gardens, the soil nourished by kelp washed up by the Atlantic\
  \ Ocean and harvested by local gardeners. Castles and ruins alongside stylish contemporary\
  \ art galleries, busy fish markets, mind boggling sculpture, outrageous street art\
  \ and many more fishing boats. We glimpsed into tiled and terracotta back yards\
  \ of small villages. Peeking over fences to see chooks, washing lines, and horreos,\
  \ we were close enough to smell what was cooking for lunch. Vintners shared handfuls\
  \ of red ripe grapes, ready to pop as soon as you touched them, juice staining our\
  \ skin all the way down to our elbows.  \nThe food along the trail was fresh, simple\
  \ and abundant. Salads were straight out of the garden and seafood was fresh from\
  \ the ocean. Small sardines fried whole became a favourite, we ate them like the\
  \ locals, enjoying their sweet crunchy heads, leaving nothing on the plate except\
  \ the squeezed lemon rind. \nIn M\u0101ori culture rain signifies tears and on the\
  \ last day of our adventure, it rained. Mindful we were walking in the same steps\
  \ that pilgrims had taken for centuries, we made our way through the old narrow\
  \ streets to the Praza do Obradoiro. We wept the kind of tears that come from somewhere\
  \ deep; they rolled down the front of our coats, mixed with the Spanish rain and\
  \ fell to the holy cobbles. We walked into the great square at each other\u2019\
  s side and stood in front of the Santiago Cathedral in each other\u2019s arms reluctant\
  \ to finish this adventure. \nThe following day we attended the pilgrim\u2019s mass.\
  \ We hobbled into the cavernous Cathedral and sat amongst the religious and the\
  \ adventurous who for their own reasons had taken a leap of faith into the unknown,\
  \ and made their way to Santiago. As the nun called out Nueva Zelanda and young\
  \ Tiraboleiros swung the Botafumeiro to deliver incense and our prayers to heaven,\
  \ our tears flowed again."
