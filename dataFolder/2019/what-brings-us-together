Text: "The boat was brought to a slow stop at a spit of sand along the bank of the\
  \ Irrawaddy River. It was December 31st 2009, and we had begun the day with Tai\
  \ Chi on the deck, as the boat languidly made it\u2019s way through this great river\
  \ of Myanmar. As I wandered along the river\u2019s edge, no sign of human settlements\
  \ or activity was in sight. A New Year\u2019s feast was being set-up on the sandy\
  \ outcrop. I breathed in the air - both sticky and fresh, my favourite kind. \n\n\
  Once the set-up was completed, we sat at tables lined with intricately patterned\
  \ cloths, our feet digging into the sand below. The group, about 20 of us, many\
  \ not fluent in a common language, began eating our appetizers and trying to create\
  \ conversation. The sun had set and we ate through the light of lanterns and a large\
  \ bonfire. An Italian man pointed away from the river, and there, just at the limit\
  \ of the bonfire light, were several teenagers and children, timidly inching toward\
  \ us. As we watched, more and more people came toward the New Year\u2019s party.\
  \ There were women carrying young children, men, boys, and young girls giggling.\
  \ Our group smiled and waved, a few of the children waved back as the young women\
  \ laughed and demurely looked away. Conversation once again broke out amoung our\
  \ group, wondering where these individuals had come from and how they had known\
  \ we were here. The locals pointed and looked and spoke amongst themselves.\n\n\
  Dinner concluded and entertainment began. Some of the boat\u2019s crew began playing\
  \ traditional music. The locals moved closer yet. They appeared enthralled by this\
  \ musical show, while us tourists, having been privy to many of these shows during\
  \ our times in Southeast Asia, were more interested in the locals\u2019 obvious\
  \ enjoyment and intrigue.\n\nIt was a small boy, of about 8, who began it all. He\
  \ moved up towards the bonfire and began to dance. It was the awkward dance expected\
  \ of an 8 year old boy, and our group, as well as the local group, began to laugh\
  \ together. A Frenchman stood and walked next the boy, holding his hands as they\
  \ twirled and twisted their way around the fire. Soon we had all stood and joined\
  \ hands around the fire, dancing and laughing. Most of the local kids and men had\
  \ joined us, and we waved and called to the women to join as well, who, after much\
  \ encouragement, joined as well.\nAround and around we went, a most random group\
  \ of individuals on a spit of land sticking out into the majestic Irrawaddy, dancing\
  \ in the New Year together, as one."
