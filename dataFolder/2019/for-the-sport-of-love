Text: "Oi! Rio de Janeiro, ominous enchantress of laid back \"life is better in flip\
  \ flops\" days with beware signs. So what if the crime rates are high, I left my\
  \ designer bag at home, took an \"I love rio\" bag from the local supermarket, a\
  \ towel, my camera and followed an olympic windsurfer friend just before the 2016\
  \ games. I got there right after a huge US sports brand had restituted the many\
  \ old open gyms with new hi-tec ones on Rio's endless beaches. The people here are\
  \ hyperactive, for the love of sport or the sport of love. Rio is a city on foot,\
  \ mainly barefoot or in havaianas. Basic prerequisite is the sun and everyone swarms\
  \ to the beaches, on bikes or skates, to play everything \"beach\" like volleyball,\
  \ tennis, football, altinho (which is a sort of soccer game where the players pass\
  \ the ball with the sole purpose of keeping it always high above ground) and of\
  \ course there\u2019s surf. You have to keep in mind that life is hard in the favelas\
  \ and sports are the best outlet for all the local youth! So surf really does save\
  \ us!\nI fell in love with a young Carioca surfer watching him steal the waves as\
  \ they hit the rock of Leme in Copacabana. Partly fascinated by his skill and majorly\
  \ dumbfounded by my lack of it. I caught some waves in Recreio under the guidance\
  \ of Andr\xE9, who, only much later, found out was a former pro surfer. That sort\
  \ of explained a lot. Before this little info came to notice, I thought Brazilians\
  \ had made a deal with the devil so they could catch waves a lot easier than the\
  \ rest of us and look a lot cooler doing so, or as cariocas say it was totally \u201C\
  irado\u201D, from the little that I got to see, as he only caught waves when I was\
  \ wiping out! Thankfully I had borrowed his rash vest to save me from further embarrassment.\
  \ I wonder if it still smells like my leather as he awkwardly declared when we said\
  \ our chaos, followed by an embrace and a kiss. \nRecreio is a world away from downtown\
  \ Rio, I took a taxi to get there in time for my lesson and was asked in Brazilian-Portuguese\
  \ if I knew that there were nudist beaches where I was going? Being a foreigner\
  \ do I even understand what he is talking about? A quick glance at the rearview\
  \ mirror, as my eyes rolled, was affirmation enough to procure an enquiry of my\
  \ preferences in going nude. Thinking it inappropriate to keep his daydreaming going\
  \ for the next hour of our ride I said no. Why, isn't it great to be a naturalist?\
  \ I guess I love clothes a lot, I am very cynic in fluent Brazilian, no matter how\
  \ scenic the route from Copacabana, to Ipanema, Barra di Tijuca and finally Recreio\
  \ is. In total astonishment nudism and toplessness are prohibited unless it's a\
  \ designated area, but the paradox is you can never go wrong with a thong. \nApres\
  \ surf I decided to take the bus for cost control and asked a local middle-aged\
  \ micro-salesman if that was the right stop, yes it was but it would take a while.\
  \ That was ok. What wasn't ok? Me claiming I had a boyfriend waiting for me in town\
  \ when clearly I wasn't wearing a ring and why isn't he with me? He was working,\
  \ it was a weekday only to be the recipient of more disbelief he could have been\
  \ a lawyer. Hesitate for a second in your response and they see window of opportunity\
  \ for ephemeral love. To this day I wonder what profession would be more convincing\
  \ and if I will ever perfect my language skills to fend off the fervent Brazilian\
  \ suitors? \nRio is admired for its geological splendour, the ocean, beaches, mountains\
  \ and natural reserves but if you ask me it's more of an astrological thing it has\
  \ going on cause it would be nothing without its cariocas, the locals. Ask Jesus\
  \ the Redeamer watching over the city who is within earshot with the stars, maybe\
  \ he knows where the magic starts."
