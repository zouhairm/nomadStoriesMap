Text: "It was a cloudy yet hot and stuffy day. Me and my friend were spending our\
  \ vacation days by the coast. Our road trip was not long, but it was worth the distance.\
  \ After a few parties, fancy restaurants and shopping, we wanted to spend the last\
  \ day of vacation on Campeche Island - a (really) small island located in Florianopolis,\
  \ Brazil, with clean waters and almost no people around. My friend asked for two\
  \ local friends to join us, and they accepted. I was actually excited.\nWhen the\
  \ said day came, the sun vanished away. We went to the beach anyway, and it was\
  \ worth the effort: the scenery was outstanding, with big rocks and lots of vegetation.\
  \ Being a fan of deserted, paradisiac beaches, I could not wish to be anywhere else.\
  \ Of course, the lack of sunlight did not stop us from playing volleyball or swimming\
  \ - even though the water felt a little bit colder than I expected. \nAlmost an\
  \ hour later, it started to rain. Despite that, we were having so much fun that\
  \ we did not want to leave at all. We sat under some trees, where the raindrops\
  \ barely caught us, and after a few minutes my friend stood up.\n\u201CAnyone hungry?\u201D\
  \nWe all raised hands.\n\u201CGood.\u201D She said. \u201CI brought some stuff to\
  \ eat. It is in the car. Be right back.\u201D\nAs she walked away, followed by one\
  \ of the guys, the other one stayed. He was tall, with curly black hair, and his\
  \ almond-colored eyes made me feel comfortable enough to start a conversation after\
  \ a few minutes of silence.\n\u201CSo\u2026\u201D I said, \u201CDo you like to live\
  \ here? I mean, near the beach. From where I come from, the mornings are foggy and\
  \ there is no seaview...\u201D\n\u201CWell, kind of.\u201D He answered with a bit\
  \ of melancholy in his voice. \u201CIt is not bad, you know. But I never felt like\
  \ I belong here, somehow.\u201D\nI wanted to ask why, but decided not to. I stared\
  \ at him, as he gazed at the sea. Ever since my friend introduced us, I felt like\
  \ he frequently looked at me, and, in the same way, something inside me had the\
  \ urge to know more about him. So, I seized the opportunity and started asking friendly\
  \ questions.\nAfter some time waiting, I started having goosebumps. It was getting\
  \ colder. I whispered:\n\u201CThose two should have been back already.\u201D\nHe\
  \ touched my hand gently, kind of surprised with its temperature.\n\u201CYou are\
  \ as cold as a corpse.\u201D He smirked. \u201CHere, come closer.\u201D\nHe embraced\
  \ me and I could feel the warmth in his skin, despite being a little wet. It was\
  \ awkward, but in a nice way. I did not felt my heart beat like that in a long time,\
  \ and I think he felt it too. As fast as the wind blow, I suddenly felt his trembling,\
  \ dry lips touch mine. And it all happened so fast that, even before I could react,\
  \ he pulled back and turned his head harshly to the other side. I only heard him\
  \ murmur \u201Csorry, I should not have...\u201D, and then I noticed my friend and\
  \ the other guy returning with bags full of snacks.\nThe rest of the day felt purely\
  \ normal - we could not stop staring at each other, hoping that what happened would\
  \ become our little secret. And then our paths diverged; I came to the hotel with\
  \ my friend, as the two boys went to their respective homes. The next day, I found\
  \ myself already hitting the road, back to my hometown, back to the routine. \n\
  I never forgot what happened in that mysterious beach, though it became just a distant\
  \ memory of someone I never met again. I waited for him to contact me, but he never\
  \ did. I thought of doing the same, but I never knew what to say. Sometimes, distance\
  \ makes things way too difficult for us to handle, and time has its own way of changing\
  \ things and changing people.\nWe carried on as time passed by. But just like raindrops\
  \ that always come back to the ground, maybe someday we will meet again."
