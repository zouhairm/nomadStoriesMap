Text: "The flight to Kazakhstan is long, almost 20 hours of remembering things I forgot\
  \ to pack, worrying if I would miss my layover, and generally second-guessing my\
  \ decision.\n\nThe day I left Los Angeles was one of the busiest days of my life.\
  \ I felt as if I had been preparing to leave for months, but in actuality, I had\
  \ only begun physically packing in the previous two days. I had been bubbling with\
  \ anxiety, and my last day I gave myself an impossible list of errands to complete.\
  \ Obviously, this just increased my overall nervousness and didn\u2019t lead to\
  \ the best state of mind when I left my parents at the airport.\n\nMy first flight\
  \ was about 13 hours long, and it felt it. I think I was wearing about 5 layers\
  \ of clothing as well as a pair of snow boots (which made is very difficult to hike\
  \ across the surprisingly large Istanbul airport). The flight itself was largely\
  \ unexciting, to my relief, but my second flight started with one of the more unusual\
  \ instances I\u2019ve had while traveling. After boarding our flight, the woman\
  \ across the aisle to me suddenly decided that she did not want to be on the flight.\
  \ Unfortunately, this woman did not speak any of the many languages present on the\
  \ large flight. This lead to a very lengthy and challenging discussion between the\
  \ flight attendants, the woman, and her friend (by phone), which eventually ended\
  \ in her exit. Somewhat obviously, but very annoyingly, this meant that the whole\
  \ flight had to be searched to see if the woman had left anything. When we finally\
  \ arrived in the early hours of the morning, Almaty was so dark, and I was so disorientated\
  \ that I felt I might have to ask if it was morning or night.\n\nI was picked up\
  \ by a taxi sent by the school and arrived at about 7 in the morning. Unfortunately,\
  \ this was two hours earlier than the dorm would allow, so I slept in one of the\
  \ TV rooms in the dorm. When I woke up I was foolishly expecting to be given a room\
  \ and a warm shower, but instead, I was whisked away along with the other exchange\
  \ students that had arrived to run a seemingly endless amount of errands. By the\
  \ end of my first day in Kazakhstan I had become familiar with various banks, a\
  \ hospital, an HIV clinic, and the \u201Cunderground\u201D, a stretch of tunnel\
  \ underneath the main street where everything from ice skating rentals to phone\
  \ contracts can be purchased. This, fortunately for me, was also the time to take\
  \ my ID photograph, which after the 48 hours awake and under stress, you can imagine\
  \ how stunning I looked.\n\nWhen I was finally returned to the dorm and given my\
  \ room, and the key that I lost yesterday, I was so tired it barely even registered\
  \ that this was my first night living in a new country, at a new school, by myself,\
  \ which is something that often occurs to me while I\u2019m walking around or eating\
  \ at a cafe, and it always makes me smile when I remember."
