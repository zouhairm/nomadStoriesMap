Text: "After a terrible break up. And being 27 at that time in my life I decided that\
  \ it was time for a big chango in my life. So I said to myself \u201C it\u2019s\
  \ now, no regrets!\u201D. So I chose Mendoza, Argentina. \nDidn\u2019t say good\
  \ bye to anyone, just send an email to my mother letting her know that I was leaving\
  \ for Mendoza. Left my laptop and my cellphone in my apartment. Dropped my flat\
  \ keys at one of my cousins house with a note that read \u201CI\u2019ll be back\
  \ soon, pay my bills I\u2019ll pay them back when I see you. Nico\u201D.\nThought\
  \ to myself \u201C I\u2019m gonna go old school on this trip\u201D and so I did.\
  \ Got on a bus to the airport with one of my guitars and a backpack full of winter\
  \ clothes ( it was winter time). Got the first one way ticket to Mendoza . Which\
  \ stopped in Buenos Aires for like 7 hours, no rush. Got to Mendoza and found the\
  \ cheapest place I could find for lodging ( shared house with individual bedrooms).\
  \ I had 1567 d\xF3lars left in cash, which was good money to live of for like three\
  \ months. \nWent out almost every night for te first two weeks. Slept with several\
  \ girls sometimes several at the same time. I felt how the emptiness of my last\
  \ heart break started to fill up with another kind of emptiness. No good! \nSo one\
  \ of the nights I was coming back home I found the door to the house busted. Properly\
  \ busted, the house was up side down. I spinted to my room and no wonder .. all\
  \ my stuff was gone. Except my guitar! Thank god I love this guitar! But none the\
  \ less all my money was gone also all my clothes and the worst part ! My passport!\
  \ So yeah. I was pretty much dead. No one knew where I was and the only one that\
  \ did, in case I would dare to ask her for money wouldn\u2019t be able to send it\
  \ my way cause I had no passport. Great! So after playing the guitar in the streets\
  \ for a few days I realized that it was not enough to make a living out of. So talking\
  \ to one of my roommates ( Diego we are still good friends, and I\u2019m god father\
  \ to one of his sons )he offered to lend me the money to go back home. But i said\
  \ no. \u201Dwhere can I go next\u201D I asked him ? He looked at me completely baffled.\
  \ And said. \u201Dwhat about Bariloche? Down south \u201C. Bariloche it is then.\
  \ He paid for my ticket. That simple action unraveled an enormous chain of events\
  \ which I don\u2019t think I\u2019ll be able to put in the remaining 239 words I\
  \ have left. \nAfter a 24 hour bus ride I arrived to Bariloche. Got out of the bus\
  \ knowing absolutely no one in town and asking for directions on the street I found\
  \ the city center. Got my guitar out and started to play. The streets were full\
  \ of people( it\u2019s a small town but on winter holidays it gets crowded , it\u2019\
  s a sky center town) and that afternoon I made like 20 dolars . That\u2019s good\
  \ money but this town is really expensive this time of year. It started snowing\
  \ and I at least 50 for food and accommodation. The night already dunked in and\
  \ I had no where to go. Snowing hard. Cold as f#%** and with nothing but what I\
  \ had on and my hunger to keep on going. As I was putting my guitar away a guy came\
  \ towards me and really politely asked me where was I from. I told him my short\
  \ traguc story. He said \u201C don\u2019t worry you can stay at our place. Hmmm\
  \ suspicious. But what could be worse than sleeping in the snowy streets?  He s\
  \ now one of my dearest friends. Thanks to him now a days I own a cabin in Bariloche\
  \ I lived there in this hippie for 3 months. When I headed back home I felt like\
  \ I was actually leaving my actual home. I met my wife in that community. Life is\
  \ weirdly lovely."
