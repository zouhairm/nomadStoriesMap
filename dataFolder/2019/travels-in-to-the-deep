Text: "This story is ancient.\nWell, it feels ancient to me-\n\nIt's abstract and\
  \ poetic and begins with part B\n\nthe ashram felt like a world afar\ndistances\
  \ to the stars\nsalty and pale nude\npurple stain and diamond dew \nthey might dance\
  \ till dusk if only\n\nif only -\nyes, my love, if only\n\ncomets left no comment\
  \ to be remembered-\nsmoke stained her mind \nas her body lay in grey cloth,\n\n\
  white -\nblack\nnoises on the rooftop-\nthe unrecognizable,\n\na bird flew in and\
  \ asked nothing of tomorrow -\n\nher paintings left unfinished-\nthe noise continued\
  \ and -\n\nfire\ndust, like flames of a magical threaded ern\nburning brilliant\
  \ brillance,,\n\nI'm cold\ncold?\nYes,\nWell,\nHere's a blanket my flame -\nMay\
  \ fireside and crystal warm, he lulled of her sensitivity,,\n\nHe kissed her toes\
  \ and they made love for the first time again .\n\nMaybe it's a curse -\nas the\
  \ history of her blanket was a faint type silver\nmemories, sometimes irremeberal\
  \ /\n\nsense maken knot -\nfirefly's fly at nay,\nhe had been witness to the willow\
  \ -\nto the dark night of yesterday's tears.\n\nAnd blast\n\nhold me,,\nshe made\
  \ a promise to herself that she was to not conjure out the devil .\n\nit was summer\
  \ and she couldn't afford to stop the ads,\nshe longed for a fan but - it was night\
  \ and the heat had cooled off in part -\nmaybe she would awake in sweats,\nwake\
  \ and tire\n\nthe tap kept turning on and she thought about water ----\n\nthe memory\
  \ of the rivers kept her safe in a melancholy calm type kind of mixed - way- able\n\
  \nshe wondered of the harp,\nand the burn on the carpet -\n\nshe blew a kiss to\
  \ life and -\nconsidered taking it back ...\n\nshe remembered the Adriatic and it's\
  \ deep unfamiliar tone and holes -\n\nsailing,\nsailing?\nYes, sailing my love\n\
  \nthe song had almost made her dance,,\nand at this moment she thought of her brother\
  \ -\nin his strong kind\nin his breathless rescue\nwith memories that may burn it\
  \ all -\n\nin broken bents the piano lulled her \nthe sheets kept her soft\nmade\
  \ her remember why she was blessed\n\nshe longed for a letter -\nwished she hadn't\
  \ thrown it away .\n\nhead from side to side from way to ways\ncan you hear it too?\n\
  \nSide by side\nA mile of lace\nAnd laughter, many of laughters -\n\nTrees amillion\n\
  I tire -\nI will hold you my dear,,\nPick you up from the gate -\n\nWhere u have\
  \ fallen\nin a heavy heap, I will shower you\nAnd I will not remind you tomorrow\
  \ of your sin -\nAs the shame may be most tormentable/ that the sincerest ash to\
  \ bear\n\nAshes,\n\nashes like dust burn to the floor - \n\nthere's a lot of fire\
  \ in this story\n\nit's a memory-\na memory of ?\nOf our shared indigo summers my\
  \ darling,\n\nMaybe it was love,\nFleeting intensity\nLust became a thick hatchet\
  \ of theory\nCoated in words and double ontondras\n\nAnd the academy might invite\
  \ her in\nWhatever that might mean -\n\nNow, it was her \nShe pictured herself-\n\
  In that white dress\nBulky and silky\nBeautiful but plumpy\n\nThe two paths diverged-\n\
  \nTrust he might say \nMaybe she had imagined it-\n\nThe weight of it immeasurable\n\
  Ever again?\nMaybe not,\nBut we have this don't we-\n\nAs others demanded their\
  \ attention and it was saved for a time more that of the solitudial\ntype\n\nI will\
  \ pick you up at 5am to dance- red\nI shall see you in the morning, he held her\
  \ hand in his heart as they barely touched\nmouthing\nWobbly and childlike \nMaybe\
  \ she might learn to swim\n\nThen she could do tricks or swim to the bottom and\n\
  Silence \nShe breathed for silenced anchor\n\nBut of breathing she did not say aloud\n\
  \nOf breathing pure she hoped indeed\n\nto sleep or to eat\nlike a story of the\
  \ once wise\nnow foolishly in despair\n\nShe wondered about love\nand its coat\n\
  it all felt like a deep nightingale with silver feathers\n\nshe liked to listen\
  \ to have the rain whimper and slow at the taste of the final night's eve\n\nthey\
  \ walked together, and, held hands at night\nit was young and they had both been"
