Text: "A plethora of red and gold mixed hue stretches over the sky , as dawn breaks\
  \ in slowly. The prolouge to sunrise has begun and the forest is waking up with\
  \ vaierty of sounds from birds. The dip in the temperature remains as the cold pinches\
  \ us in our bones, even when we are enveloped in blankets, waiting for a sight of\
  \ the most majestic of beasts , The Royal Bengal Tiger.\n\n\" Tiger's being solo\
  \ Hunter are master of camouflage, and that makes it elusive to sight it in the\
  \ wild. \" Says Ramesh our gypsy driver as we drive inside the park. \n\nTadoba\
  \ National Park, situated exactly in the centre of India, is renowned for it's Flora\
  \ and fauna. It stretches a remarkable six hundred square kilometre of forest mainly\
  \ sub tropical deciduous vegetation in nature. Sal , teak and wide grasslands form\
  \ it's landscape with tribal villages in and around the national park formed officially\
  \ in 1995.\n\nLike any forest adventure, Tadoba has it's own flavour. The hooting\
  \ of the owl , the screeching of nocturnal birds , the rustic footstep of the creatures\
  \ walking on dried leaves or the meditating sound created by crickets, make up for\
  \ an unmatched ambience here. Nodoubt people tired of concrete jungle lifestyle\
  \ flock here time and again in leap of an unknown.\n\nTadoba is a four hour drive\
  \ from Nagpur (nearest airport) via Chandrapur , nearest railway station to the\
  \ national park.\n\nThe tribe called \" Adivasis\"  constitute the prime human population\
  \ around the park. As you approach Moharli village the entry point of the park,\
  \ you find the local lifetysle intriguing.\nThe adivasi men generally seen, wearing\
  \ a white loin cloth from hips to knees called Dhoti , and the women in their simple\
  \ plain but bright coloured sarees, as you pass them.\nThe men mostly tend to their\
  \ farmland, and the children with big beautiful smiles tend to the family livestock.\
  \ The women are mostly seen collecting wood from the forest and busy in daily domestic\
  \ duty of cooking and water collecting in their earthen clay pots.\n\n Jagdish our\
  \ knowledgeable guide today belongs from the tribe itself. \n\" Our prime deity\
  \ \" Taru\" was a famed warrior , was killed while saving a kid by a tiger, according\
  \ to legend.  In his honour the forest is called Tadoba. \" He had informed us.\
  \ \n\nTaru's temple can be found in front of the Tadoba lake. Here a beautiful sunrise\
  \ is giving way to the landscape which can be considered a masterpiece.\nThe wide\
  \ plain in front, has brown and dry grass carpeted over it. At far around hundred\
  \ metres, the Tadoba lake shines. The lake serpents through the plain and goes out\
  \ of view as the vegetation grow from grass land to tall trees. The curtain of tall\
  \ and dense Sal veils the exact ending point of the lake. \nThe sky above the tree\
  \ is now fully pinkish red and the sun is almost up, bright orange orb. The glassy\
  \ water of the lake captures the reflection of the sky perfectly. \nAnd around the\
  \ lake, herds of spotted deer, wild boars , grey langurs and indian bisons is standing\
  \ on alert, knowing the majesty is very near. \n\nAs the  drama unfolds, slowly\
  \ in it's calm relaxing manner , the tiger named T6 makes it's entry.\nIt doesn't\
  \ seem much interested in the prey base that flocks around. \nThe whole attention\
  \ in air is centered towards the tiger. The herbivores are on high alert, screaming\
  \ alarm calls regularly , warning their mates of the impending beast.\n\nThe tiger\
  \ however , just keeps on his graceful walk.\nIt's true that a lion walks royal,\
  \ like king of the beast, but a tiger's walk can be best described as someone ,\
  \ who doesn't care who the King is , anyways.\n\nFrom my gypsies afar, I admire\
  \ it's power , the muscular frame built in beautiful yellow and black coat, that\
  \ slowly walks across the plain to the other side of the dense forest. I like a\
  \ ardent devotee try to take in the divine sight , as much as possible through my\
  \ eyes.\nBefore it vanishes, it turns one last time , right into my eyes, I am baptized,\
  \ in the forever love of seeking it for rest of my life."
