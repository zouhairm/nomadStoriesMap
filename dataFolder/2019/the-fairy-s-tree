Text: "Gusts of wind sent particles of rock flying towards me and every time I closed\
  \ my eyes I could see a shadow image of the clifftop monastery painted on my eyelids.\
  \  The chalky rock outcrop scraped my hand as the ledge crumbled in my grasp, and\
  \ the dust in my eyes made it hard to focus.  The sea of trees below me surged in\
  \ the wind, making my stomach churn.  For a moment I was afraid to breathe.  The\
  \ fading crack of falling shards interrupted the murmur of the wind through the\
  \ trees, and my sudden shriek of laughter surprised me almost as much as it did\
  \ Byamba.  \n\n\u201CAre you OK?\u201D  The head lama had traversed the cliff face\
  \ as agilely as a mountain goat and was peeking at me from inside a carved out grotto\
  \ further along.  \n\n\u201CI love it!\u201D I shouted, \u201CIt\u2019s been so\
  \ long since I\u2019ve heard the rustle of wind through the trees,\u201D I said\
  \ as I crawled inside.  The chill of the cavern air was a relief from the hot wind\
  \ outside.  \n\n\u201CThe literal meaning of our province is \u2018northern hilly\
  \ wooded place\u2019,\u201D Byamba said as he stared across the valley, squinting\
  \ in the sunlight.  It was hard for me to believe that the province was named for\
  \ the forest.  I\u2019d been in Mongolia for a year, teaching English in a nearby\
  \ village named for an ancient Uigher queen, and this remote mountaintop was the\
  \ first time that I\u2019d seen vegetation taller than my ankles.  The endless rolling\
  \ hills on the steppe surrounding my home made it impossible to discern perspective,\
  \ an agoraphobic\u2019s nightmare.  I\u2019d sent my mother a photo, and she\u2019\
  d replied, \u201CThat\u2019s just dust!\u201D \n\nByamba explained the recent problems\
  \ with desertification.  \u201COur environment has been destroyed by over-grazing,\
  \ deforestation, corrupt mining practices, foreign powers profiting from our resources,\u201D\
  \ he grimaced, \u201Cand our own people selling out.\u201D  Byamba and I were planning\
  \ a seminar at the monastery for regional high school teachers.  We wanted to help\
  \ them incorporate environmental issues into their lesson plans. The main buildings\
  \ of the monastery complex were further down the slopes, but I was on the full tour,\
  \ which included the isolated temples near the peak.\n\nHis trailing voice echoed\
  \ against the walls of the grotto as he walked, \u201C...and the monk remained in\
  \ this cave for twenty-five years, eating cheese.\u201D  \n\n\u201CTwenty-five years\
  \ of cheese?  Even in winter, when dairy products are scarce?\u201D \n\nByamba\u2019\
  s roar of laughter filled the cave, \u201CNo, no\u2026  not byaslakh, but byalaslakh.\
  \  You know, it\u2019s when you sit and reflect!\u201D  I sighed, making my embarrassment\
  \ palpable.  \u201CIt\u2019s ok, our words for \u2018cheese\u2019 and \u2018meditation\u2019\
  \ are quite similar,\u201D Byamba explained.  \u201COr maybe you are thinking of\
  \ the monks in Khentii Province, who reach nirvana through cheese consumption. \
  \ They say they have the best dairy products in the country!\u201D  \n\n\u201COh,\
  \ of course,\u201D my exaggerated nod belied the affected confidence in my tone,\
  \ and I giggled with him at his joke of the stately monks of Khentii amongst piles\
  \ of cheese.  \n\nWe continued to a clearing tucked beneath the mountain peak, thorny\
  \ berry bushes leading to the temple of the luusiin naga.  The bright reds and blues\
  \ of the temple glowed softly, a dollhouse replica of the palatial complex further\
  \ down.  The temple seemed to shimmer and expand as I stared at it, mesmerized.\
  \  \u201CThe naga are always around,\u201D Byamba explained.  \u201CCould be that\
  \ rock, that flower, anything really.\u201D  \n\nHe directed my attention to a gnarled\
  \ old tree.  Its tangled roots rose from the rocks and its branches held the whole\
  \ clearing in their grasp.  \u201CThat\u2019s the fairy\u2019s tree.  It has an\
  \ ear just there,\u201D he pointed to a misshapen knot with a small hole in the\
  \ middle.  \u201CAsk it anything, maybe the fairies will grant your wishes!\u201D\
  \  The tree loomed over me, luring me closer.  I crept through the stones and shrubs,\
  \ wondering which were fairies in disguise.  I scrambled up the roots and stood\
  \ tippy-toe, leaning into the trunk to whisper into its knotty ear.  The rough bark\
  \ scratched my cheek and the smell of the wood enveloped me as my whispered wishes\
  \ dissolved into the rustling of the leaves."
