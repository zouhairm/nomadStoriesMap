Text: "Reflection\n\nI\xB4m sitting cross-legged in the backyard of the beautiful\
  \ house in Christchurch, New Zealand, where moved in yesterday. \nMy Eyes are closed.\
  \ I take a deep breath and observe the thoughts and feelings that arise. \nI become\
  \ aware. I accept. I release. \nAs I dive deeper into the Ocean of my mind, I sink\
  \ into the space of peace with all that is and all that has ever been.\nI allow\
  \ myself to just BE. \nGentle rays of sunshine are warming my face and the Light\
  \ seems to dance in all colors of the rainbow in the reflection of my inner Eye.\
  \ My Body is relaxing deeper into itself and I\xB4m surrendering to the process\
  \ of melting into my surroundings. The wind is whispering his never ending wisdom,\
  \ while he is dancing with the leaves of the Trees. The Flowers and plants seem\
  \ to reach out for me, while my root is growing deeper and deeper into Mother Earth...\
  \ As I connect and open to the great Symphony of Life itself, every cell of my Body\
  \ is vibrating. I\xB4m alive.\nI\xB4m breathing as ONE with Creation. In Harmony.\
  \ In Peace. In Love...\n\nTime doesn\xB4t exist anymore. Only change. And everything\
  \ is constantly changing. The River of Life never stops flowing and as I learned\
  \ to embrace the challenges that await along the shores, I found more and more pieces\
  \ of myself that I never even knew I had lost. \n\nWho am I and what brought me\
  \ here on the Journey to my own Soul and therefor the Soul of all Creation? \n\n\
  My Name is Alena [greek: the Light] Merle [celtic: blackbird] Varchmin.  \nOne Year\
  \ ago I was a 19 year old girl, who got alone on a plane to Bangkog. Without plans,\
  \ without expectations, but with the strong believe  in a loving God, the Mission\
  \ to contribute my part in making the world a better place and the willpower to\
  \ face anything that will keep me from realizing my Dreams. \n\nEver since I\xB4\
  ve experienced countless miracles. I climbed mountains and faced storms within me\
  \ and around me. Eager to find out who I am and what my purpose is, I dared to question\
  \ everything I ever believed to be true and looked for answers in my own Heart.\
  \ \nThe more I asked the more answers I received and every answer lead to more questions.\n\
  \nOne year ago, I had no idea that I would remember lifetimes before my soul entered\
  \ this physical Body. I had no Idea that ancient memories of Lifes where I lived\
  \ as Shamana would come back to me.  \nI couldnt have imagined what it means to\
  \ experience being touched and healed by a Spirit of pure Love and Light. \nI had\
  \ no Idea that I was able to leave my physical Body and experience states of absolute\
  \ freedom and bliss, that I would wake up in my Dreams and be able to enter different\
  \ Realities, where I could fly and breathe under water. \nBut as I remembered who\
  \ I am and connected to my Soul and therefor the Soul of all Creation, I knew in\
  \ my Heart that all of it was real.\n\nI have been the Medicine Woman, the Dreamwalker,\
  \ the Voice of the Spirits for many Lifetimes in many Worlds  and now that I opened\
  \ my Eyes and understand who I am, I have to share all the beautiful truths I found\
  \ about the Mystery of Creation... \nI was born with a Mission and nothing will\
  \ ever keep me from living my Purpose. \nNow is the time for transformation. Now\
  \ is the time to remember and to reclaim the connection to  Spirit that has a place\
  \ in everyones Heart, if we open the door to unconditional Love, forgiveness and\
  \ Oneness. \n\nNamast\xE9 dear Reader,\nI hope that my Story will inspire you to\
  \ find back into your own Heart, so that you may discover the magic of Life for\
  \ yourself. I hope that you dare to believe in the Miracle and follow the path into\
  \ uncertainty. Great Treasures await the ones who follow the calling of a greater\
  \ Purpose and trust in the Love of the one who created everything..."
