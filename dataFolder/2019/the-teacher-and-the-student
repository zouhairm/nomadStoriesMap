Text: "We weren't given any specifics about the project, much less about the children\
  \ we would be working with, until the day before we started our volunteer work.\
  \  Holding on for dear life on the back of a moto taxi as we sped down dirt roads\
  \ that led us to our destination, I recalled the information that had at long last\
  \ been shared with us at orientation: We were volunteering at an in-patient rehabilitation\
  \ center for children in recovery for drugs and alcohol.  They greeted us with big\
  \ smiles and bare feet, pulling with all their weight on the towering, impenetrable\
  \ metal doors that separated them and the rest of the world.  We were invited in\
  \ to the jungle like finca, and a home that was rumored to belong to Pablo Escobar\
  \ in Colombia's not so distant, violent past. The irony brought a smirk to my face\
  \ and a reassurance to my spirit, that I had made the right decision in joining\
  \ this Sports Development program.  \nAdjusting to full time volunteer work, while\
  \ simultaneously studying for my yoga instructor's certification full time, had\
  \ proven to be a challenge.  One that made me feel like maybe I had bitten off more\
  \ than I could chew.  The project coordinator had given me the green light, I had\
  \ time allotted every day to teaching the children yoga.  As part of their rehabilitation,\
  \ all 32 children were also educated in the importance of making sound choices,\
  \ being self aware, cultivating mindfulness and embracing spirituality.  \"A definite\
  \ feat,\" I thought to myself as I watched their animated dancing, singing and swinging\
  \ from tree branches to reach ripe tamarind for sharing.  Every day we sat, wiggling\
  \ bodies, peeking eyes and giggly bickering.  We breathed.  We moved.  Awkwardly\
  \ at first, but progressing and growing every day.  The sparkle in their eyes as\
  \ they would have me witness just how much they progressed every time I saw them\
  \ made me believe in the power of positive influence, even and especially, outside\
  \ of your comfort zone. Delving into the art of teaching a yoga practice brought\
  \ me joy, but using the same practice that has had such an immeasurable impact on\
  \ my life, to help guide and influence children recovering from such a hard and\
  \ tainted past, brought with it a sense of fulfillment that I had never known. \
  \ A month flew by faster than I was ready for and with teary eyed goodbyes, the\
  \ most profound realizations were made: Regardless of background, we are all more\
  \ similar than we are different and we can help each other grow in ways unimaginable.\
  \  And by playing the role of teacher in the art of being grateful, present and\
  \ aware in their unfolding stories, I found that it was also my own story I was\
  \ uncovering, that the teacher, does in fact, become the student."
