Text: "The smell of sulfur had just reached us. My travel partner Caitlin slid off\
  \ her flip flops as our boat the\_King Thiras\_drifted closer to the jagged rocks\
  \ jutting out from Nea Kameni.\n\n\u201CIts about a 60m swim to the hot springs\
  \ so you will have to be a fairly strong swimmer,\u201D our tour guide Teresa announced\
  \ huskily, \u201Cget ready children.\u201D\n\nShe had been rallying us with cries\
  \ of \u201CChildren! Children!\u201D all day despite the fact that most of our group\
  \ bordered on 40 years old.\nI took a peak over the edge \u2013 the water which\
  \ had looked invitingly blue earlier was now rippling and dark; slapping ominously\
  \ against the bow. \_\u201CI think I\u2019ll have to sit this one out,\u201D I mumbled\
  \ to Caitlin.\n\n\u201CAre you sure? It could be really fun,\u201D she looked concerned.\n\
  \nThe boat swayed as someone far braver than me jumped straight off of the railing.\n\
  \n\u201CYeah, nah I\u2019ll be fine watching here,\u201D I tried to sound blas\xE9\
  .\n\nCaitlin hesitated before she nodded and headed for the line of bathing suit-clad\
  \ bodies waiting to climb the ladder into the Aegean Sea.\n\nI looked back towards\
  \ the cove where Teresa had pointed earlier. The hot springs were warmed by a volcano\
  \ and it smelled like a carton of old eggs but the waters were bursting with (alleged)\
  \ healing properties. I turned to watch everyone getting in.\n\nSuddenly, a blur\
  \ of folded tan skin and black spandex moved nearby. An old man shuffled over to\
  \ the line. His skin was browned and creased; his hair bleached white from years\
  \ spent under the sun. Wrinkles lined his face \u2013 especially deep around his\
  \ eyes and mouth \u2013 creating a crumpled illustration of many years spent chuckling,\
  \ thinking, cursing, grinning, living. He looked like the type of man who laughed\
  \ unreservedly and liked to speak with his mouth full of food. He had discarded\
  \ all of his clothes save for a tiny black speedo and a gold chain that glinted\
  \ in the mid-morning rays.\n\nI launched myself from my seat. \n\nI was not about\
  \ to be bested by an old man in a speedo.\n\nThe hot springs of Santorini in the\
  \ Greek Cyclades have a history of reputed healing. An active volcano rumbles faintly\
  \ beneath the surface of Nea Kameni island. The last eruption was in 1953. Warm\
  \ wisps of smoke drift up from the blackened volcanic rock. Fingertips pressed to\
  \ the hot, dried earth come back near scorched; reminding visitors to the island\
  \ just how not long ago 1953 was. Brilliant blue waters warmed by the heart of the\
  \ volcano lap at the edges of the island. They\u2019re said to be filled with therapeutic\
  \ properties especially helpful to the ailments that come with old age.\n\nMaybe\
  \ that explained the old man\u2019s eagerness to take a dip in the hot springs.\n\
  \nCasting one last look up to the deck, I loosened my fingers from the ladder and\
  \ jumped, landing with an ungraceful splash. The water was rolling in the opposite\
  \ direction of where I wanted to go. I pushed my doggy paddle to the extreme.\n\n\
  With salt up my nose and while spitting out mouthfuls of water I made it to the\
  \ rocky outcrop of the island and clung on. Stationary, I blinked water out of my\
  \ eyes. The sulfur was much stronger in the cove. Around me people splashed and\
  \ paddled. A few joined me on the rocks. We swapped bashful smiles, happy to be\
  \ in the hot springs, and happier still to be clinging to something solid. I breathed\
  \ hard and deep trying to summon up the will power to swim back. I wriggled my toes\
  \ near the surface of the water, surprised to see them tinged orange. The mud and\
  \ sand was slowly staining my skin with ochre streaks. Was this part of the healing\
  \ process?\n\nThe sun baked my hair onto my head and neck until it was stiff with\
  \ salt, manganese, and iron. Teresa waved from the boat calling us back.\n\nI thought\
  \ I caught a glimpse of the old man\u2019s head bobbing towards\_King Thiras. Letting\
  \ go of the rock, I paddled hard, determined not to be upstaged by the wrinkled\
  \ speedo proprietor yet again."
