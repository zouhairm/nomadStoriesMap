Text: "I have always been curious to find out unexplored facts about places, humans,\
  \ history basically every possible thing. I went to Indore and started exploring\
  \ nearby places. I found those places on the internet, read about all of them and\
  \ started visiting them one by one. \nSo the first place was \u201CRajwada\u201D\
  . I reached there and started writing about the places and people nearby kind of\
  \ agreed to the information that I was carrying along with me. I was confident about\
  \ what I was writing till someone texted me that, what you are writing about Indore\
  \ is incomplete. I could not sleep that night and started my research on the internet\
  \ about the history of Indore. I woke up and went to those places again and this\
  \ time I went to each and every street inquiring about the oldest human alive here\
  \ who can elaborate the historical facts about Indore. I soon realized that all\
  \ of them knew a part of history but no one could tell me about how did it all begin.\
  \ But when there is a will, there is a way. I kept on doing my research for the\
  \ next six months and concluded that whatever is written on the internet about the\
  \ history of Indore is TOTALLY WRONG starting from the first line itself. Here is\
  \ a brief of my research that clearly states that Indore started long before Holkars.\n\
  \nIf you are new to Indore and ask someone about the foundation of Indore the most\
  \ common and instant reply you get is \u201CHOLKARS\u201D. With all due respect\
  \ HOLKARS have very strong historical terms with Indore but the the question is,\
  \ who is the founder of Indore? And this has been answered wrong each and everytime\
  \ since decades.\n\nStarted in 1600 AD, existence of Indore actually came into being\
  \ from the village Kampel which is located 20 kms North-East from Indore. At that\
  \ time, Mughals were ruling India and gave the authority of Kampel to Rao Ganeshdasji.\
  \ Rao Ganeshadasji's position was later handed over to his son Rao Balaram. \n\n\
  Rao Balaram in the desire of getting a son travelled to take the blessings of a\
  \ renowned priest of 1600 AD at Lord Indreshwar Temple. It is located on the banks\
  \ of KAHNA RIVER which is now popularly known as KHAN RIVER(Khan Naala). Soon after\
  \ taking the priest's blessings Rao Balaram's wife, who was from Dhamnod, Geeta\
  \ Bai broke the news that she was expecting a child. On his next visit to Indreshwar\
  \ temple, the priest advised Rao Balaram to move near the bank of this river, also\
  \ known as CHANDRABHAGA(Hindi/Sanskrit terminology). Rao really liked the idea of\
  \ residing near Indreshwar Temple and passed an order to construct the first ever\
  \ palace of Indore. This place is now known as SHRI SANSTHAN BADA RAOLA.\n\nAfter\
  \ 1715 AD situation of Mughals started worsening as all Indian rulers and powers\
  \ were collaborating with each other under the \u201CHINDU PAD PADSHAHI\u201D movement.\
  \ Rao Nandlal and Sawai Raja Jaisingh of Jaipur used to support each other and were\
  \ in a very congenial brotherly relationship. Meanwhile, Peshwa Bajirao was rising\
  \ in that era and was in talks with Sawai Raja to make the movement successful.\
  \ In a conversation between Sawai Raja and Peshwa about Malwa, Sawai Raja made Peshwa\
  \ understand that it is a good deal to join forces with Rao Nandlal as a support\
  \ in Malwa rather than fighting against him. Moreover, it is impossible to plan\
  \ an attack on Malwa region by crossing the river without the support of Rao Nandlal.\
  \ Rao Nandlal also agreed to the proposal. Peshwa Bajirao sent Malhar Rao Holkar\
  \ as the chief of Peshwa in Malwa. \n\nBefore getting inside Malwa, Sawai Raja,\
  \ Rao Nandlal and Malhar Rao Holkar set up a meeting and officially declared each\
  \ other as brothers and signed a treaty which stated that they will not enter each\
  \ other\u2019s territory without sending prior notice and will not interrupt in\
  \ each other\u2019s operations.\n\nIndore holds a detailed history of more than\
  \ 300 years but THIS PART IS COMPLETELY MISSING FROM EVERYWHERE and this is how\
  \ I ran into the facts related to the history of a city which I never expected to\
  \ find."
