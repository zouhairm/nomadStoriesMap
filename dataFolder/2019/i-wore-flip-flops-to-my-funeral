Text: "Despite the widespread belief that the north of Spain lives in an everlasting\
  \ autumn from May till September, I decided, following the recommendations of iPhone's\
  \ weather app, to only pack a pair of flip-flops, a Bermuda short and a couple of\
  \ bright t-shirts for my brief excursion to Galicia. That was, of course, my first\
  \ (fatal) mistake of the trip.\n\nOn the boiling, sweaty morning of the 28th of\
  \ July I was up and running. And for about a hundred miles, everything went fine:\
  \ my soon-to-be long hair had been cordially invited by the wind to perform an impromptu\
  \ dance on The Killers greatest hits, and my confidence in getting there before\
  \ lunch was boosting. \n\nUntil trouble arrived: the left tire exploded, the car\
  \ went off the road and I crashed hard, really hard. I'd always thought near misses\
  \ were an extraordinary phenomenon,  something that would never happen to me. However,\
  \ while spinning in middle air, I realized that those close calls were as fascinating\
  \ and as interesting as the stories that accompanied them. And my story was not\
  \ over.\n\nAt this point in time, having kicked the front door of the car and with\
  \ my fluorescent vest on point, I put myself in the middle of the road. I shouted\
  \ like never before in my life but, at the same time, I felt voiceless looking at\
  \ the remains of the accident. A stroke of luck. It was quite soon when a red Toyota\
  \ came to my rescue. And, after lots of paperwork and phone calls shenanigans, he\
  \ proved to me that my luck hadn't run out yet. He would take me to As Neves, a\
  \ small village in Galicia where he lived with his family. He said to me that he\
  \ had found the right candidate. \n\nEvery 29th of July As Neves celebrate the cult\
  \ of Santa Marta de Ribaterme. It's your typical fashion Spanish romeria (or pilgrimage)\
  \ but with a morbid twist: each year people who've had near death experiences are\
  \ exhibited in open coffins while being paraded across the streets. And I, with\
  \ my flip-flops (shoes didn't survive the crush) and Bermudas, was the perfect candidate.\
  \ Legend says that the clothes you enter the coffin with, are the ones you'll die\
  \ on. I should've brought my pajamas."
