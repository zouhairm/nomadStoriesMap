Text: "Jahnavi, 21. \nThe past 20 years of my life have gone through the traditional\
  \ regimen that a young Indian girl has to abide by. The first 17 years of my life\
  \ went by in travelling back and forth to high school, the hockey practices after,\
  \ travelling to my tutor where in reality all I wanted was to get the hot chocolate\
  \ from the cafe next door. With a pocket money of just Dhs 200 per month, all I\
  \ could afford was an 'Eat Pray Love' written by Elizabeth Gilbert and travel at\
  \ least 3 countries through that and full fill my dreams, all within the span of\
  \ my head and within the reach of my bedroom.\nThis dream came true two months back,\
  \ when I actually managed to save up Dhs 6,000 to sponsor my own annual university\
  \ trip which unfortunately lasted for only 5 days. Well, I'm in third year now hence\
  \ it was high time I get out of the city for a bit. Can't stress on how it really\
  \ was high time! Extremely casual about the whole bag packing, winter clothing and\
  \ makeup essentials, I was well prepped then 80% of the students travelling with\
  \ me, only because of the hundreds of travel blogs that I follow on Instagram every\
  \ year.\nYou must be thinking which metropolis is so pricey where a 5 day trip comes\
  \ down to Dhs 6,000. but one of the most romantic destinations where a good pasta,\
  \ good signifying one that is full of cheese and fresh herbs and tomatoes but mostly\
  \ the cheese, simply the most complicated dish that could be pronounced from the\
  \ menu, costing 20 euros at least. Where beer is cheaper than soft drinks and is\
  \ available at the nearest grocery for about 2 euros and where all the classic brands\
  \ including Fendi, Prada and Gucci the one's that I look up to are located together\
  \ in the same lane on the streets of Florence one of the cities that I adored in\
  \ Italy. \nBut the one I loved the most, was Venice, where the Gondola ride was\
  \ an epitome of romantic scenes. I didn't expect to experience my first intimate\
  \ moment amidst all the breeze, churches, lovely architecture and delicious food.\n\
  \u201CCities were always like people, showing their varying personalities to the\
  \ traveler. Depending on the city and on the traveler, there might begin a mutual\
  \ love, or dislike, friendship, or enmity. Where one city will rise a certain individual\
  \ to glory, it will destroy another who is not suited to its personality. Only through\
  \ travel can we know where we belong or not, where we are loved and where we are\
  \ rejected.\u201D -Roman Payne\nAmongst Rome, Milan, Florence, Venice and the Vatican\
  \ City the city that I could adapt and relate to the most was definitely Florence,\
  \ the town where I ran to McDonald's with this Italian dude I met on the trip, where\
  \ I bought 5 bottles of wine, one of which I broke and was told it's a sign of good\
  \ luck, but i simply thought that cute Italian guy at the counter was trying to\
  \ rip me off because I innocently admitted being a tourist in the most beautiful\
  \ city just for two days. \nMost importantly the three different romantic connections\
  \ that I made in Venice, Florence and even in Rome the capital city where I bumped\
  \ into the smartest looking guy on the trip along with me on the Spanish steps,\
  \ ohh, the Spanish steps, couldn't match up to the love I have for the most romantic\
  \ country in the world. I would definitely go back in the next few years just to\
  \ taste the new additions at Venchi, spend an extra day at Milan only because I\
  \ shall have the cash then and will be able to afford the adorable pieces showcased\
  \ on the mannequins and have many more tiny love affairs and dine at the best restaurants\
  \ in each of the cities. \nThe tiramisu that I didn't get to taste, the guy at the\
  \ counter who's prediction was faulty, and the wish that I forgot to make at the\
  \ Trevi fountain are the reasons I'll go back to the place again."
