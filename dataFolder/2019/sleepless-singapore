Text: "I would never imagine that I could encounter such a similar soul, in a strange\
  \ city Singapore, who happened to come from the same city, study at the same university,\
  \ and now miraculously, stumble on each other, face to face, in a serene coffee\
  \ shop, simultaneously awkwardly and elatedly. It felt like Jesse and Celine in\
  \ Before Sunrise, except that we did not met on a train, but matched on Tinder at\
  \ the very first beginning. \nBack then, I was on a sponsored five-day trip, as\
  \ a WTA (Women's Tennis Association) Chinese Volunteer, to witness the hand-over\
  \ ceremony of WTA Finals from Singapore to Shenzhen, China; and he just got away\
  \ from the hustle and bustle of his mundane work.\nThat night was supposed to be\
  \ a quick date, as we had complete anonymity about each other before meet-up, yet\
  \ both of us know for sure that we might never see each other again in quite long\
  \ time. But it turned out to be a tender night, after our revelation of so much\
  \ in common; and we wound up roaming around and conversing deep into the neon light.\n\
  We went to the tournament together at that night. The final was fabulous, not just\
  \ the game itself, but everything around, the settings, the atmosphere and the audience.\
  \ The finale was staged in an indoor stadium, so that every bit of emotion, echoed\
  \ with the sound of strikes, cumulated and culminated with appalling applause. The\
  \ compelling acoustics and lighting during the breaks turned the match into a live\
  \ concert, where everyone seemed engaged in the scene. We held hands, and shrugged\
  \ shoulders to the beats and booms, intoxicated without alcohol, resolving in the\
  \ background of waves of cheers. The carnival was not unfitting with our Eastern\
  \ nature at all, but rather suited and soothed very well.\n\nDessert stalls were\
  \ our next destination, from where timeless source of comfort and consolation derived\
  \ for travellers and expatriates; a bowl of green bean soup is akin to a blow of\
  \ nostalgia from homeland. In Singapore, most of veteran stalls were run by Chinese\
  \ and their families, who migrated from Canton in Mainland China or Hong Kong decades\
  \ ago, and therefore the most traditional touches were well reserved in the dishes\
  \ as Diam Sam remains to be the crown jewel in Chinese culinary. We settled at a\
  \ table and stared at each other, silently, reckoning that years ago, we might just\
  \ pass by at the street corner on our way to school. Giggled, we began to swap stories\
  \ back then on campus, trying hard to find even more commons.\n\nAfter the gourmet\
  \ dessert, we continued to stroll on the road, even though most of stores were closed\
  \ and clock was ticking to midnight. Both of us knew there must be an end, as tomorrow\
  \ morning, I will be leaving this city, and he will go back to the cubicles for\
  \ another day of endless meeting; neither of us called to a halt. The streets seemed\
  \ to be endless, and we tireless.\nThere was a saying that Singapore never slept,\
  \ so were we at that night."
