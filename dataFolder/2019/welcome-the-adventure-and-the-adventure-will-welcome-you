Text: "\u201CLet\u2019s just split so we can do what we\u2019d love to!\u201D\nIt\
  \ was our very last night in Denmark, the last chance to create the most memorable\
  \ travel experience ever. However, travel mates are not always chosen to fit you.\
  \ So here it comes, after a long week of disagreements, I took the risk to suggest\
  \ the most rational way for people who had different needs and desires. \nFortunately,\
  \ it worked. And now we were free, with my two best friends, to explore a brand\
  \ new Scandinavian fairy tale within a few hours.\nWe took the train to Malmo in\
  \ hope to see the beauty of \xD8resund Bridge and actually failed, as it gets darker\
  \ very early in Scandinavia.\nAfter arrival, we literally took an elevator to get\
  \ out of the station, and it was kind of bizarre for me: seemed like in a fantasy\
  \ movie. And here it was: an unexplored city full of Christmas lights and amazing\
  \ modern architecture! While inquiring people we found out there were two main squares\
  \ in the city: big and small. We had a good appetite for discoveries, and we started\
  \ to search for the big one. Deceiving enough, almost everything was closed or was\
  \ going to close, as in Denmark. The streets were deserted, and we were walking\
  \ along enjoying the beauty of the Swedish calmness. It was much safer, although\
  \ we were all alone in a foreign country in the middle of the night. I didn't feel\
  \ discomfort or anxiety, and this was helping me to enjoy my time at a maximum.\n\
  We walked in the streets, then along the river, singing and laughing out loud most\
  \ of the time. When we were doing none of the mentioned, we were posing for good\
  \ pictures to update our Facebook profiles. And then suddenly my mate remembered\
  \ it was the last day to submit her UWC application. Hence we were obliged to find\
  \ a restaurant with a Wi-Fi connection and obviously, it was the most expensive\
  \ one in the whole Little Square. \nThe Cr\xE8me Brulee I ordered was the best Cr\xE8\
  me Brulee I have ever eaten in my life. More or less, we had a great time in the\
  \ restaurant, ignoring, of course, the fact that we were tired tourists not really\
  \ fitting in the dress code of that luxury place.\nAfter the application was submitted,\
  \ we went to the supermarket near the train station to do some shopping. I still\
  \ wonder why we were so confident of finding it open at 1 a.m., however, back in\
  \ time we were shocked with its closure. Nothing was left to do, so we went to the\
  \ station to find out when the train leaves. It is essential to add that a decision\
  \ was made to satisfy our starving stomachs with a Subway sandwich. Frankly speaking,\
  \ I was waiting for this particular moment since I had known about the Subway brand.\
  \ I would like to say that it justified my expectations, but all I remember now\
  \ is that the station cafeteria was extremely dirty and unpleasant. However, I kept\
  \ the \"Subway\" sticker which was on my sandwich, and I believe it is still somewhere\
  \ in my things (hopefully I haven't thrown it (yet)).\nMinutes were passing, and\
  \ there was no other passenger in the station. No one who could help us to get information,\
  \ to find the right gate, to understand what was going on. Taking into account that\
  \ our flight was in a few hours, it was frightening. And then a message changed\
  \ it all. Not even remembering how I connected to a WiFi and read the letter out\
  \ loud: \"There will be no train for today, so if you hurry, you will get to the\
  \ last free bus which will bring you to the airport.\u201D And then I saw the bus\
  \ from the window. \"We are saved,\" I thought. And I started running. It is quite\
  \ ridiculous, but there were only three places left on the bus. We were definitely\
  \ ON TIME. And we moved. We did it.\nBy the way, this was a lucky day for my friend,\
  \ as she is now in UWC Maastricht probably sometimes remembering this adventurous\
  \ night in Malmo."
