Text: "Valparaiso was once a bustling port, filled to the brim with sailors and merchants:\
  \ a flourishing trade route. Today, it may be a memory of its former glory, though\
  \ it is not without its charms. \nOn this particular day, I found myself in the\
  \ midst of the city, in a silent quarter towards the west, beside a simple church,\
  \ built and decorated in unfamiliar style.\nI was not alone here but might as well\
  \ have been. I felt alien amongst the natives, who stared boldly and coldly, wolves\
  \ to the slaughter. A lamb, I walked the stone steps to the entrance, a place to\
  \ hide, soon swallowed by the eerie silence of a place of worship.\n\n\u2018No hablamos\
  \ ingl\xE9s aqu\xED.\u2019\nSwept along a bay bordering the South Pacific Ocean,\
  \ Valparaiso nestles into the surrounding hills, covering them with a crawling carpet\
  \ of humanity. Even the stars here speak a language I am unfamiliar with. I have\
  \ been warned that local Valparaisians are not much given to welcoming foreigners,\
  \ and my distinct lack of Spanish tends to agree. \nThe stoic iglesia I had found\
  \ myself in earlier had been a haven of sanctuary amidst an ocean of chaos. The\
  \ local post office, in which I now found myself, was the distinct opposite. \n\
  Why was I here? To send a parcel: a parcel destined for Santiago. Unfortunately,\
  \ yo no hablo espa\xF1ol, and the people here no hablan ingl\xE9s.\nI find myself\
  \ at an impasse, unable to proceed, yet incapable of leaving before my task is complete.\
  \ What to do? Their eyes on me tell me all I need to know: how dare I come here\
  \ with the assumption that they will speak my language in a country that belongs\
  \ to them. For a moment, panic creeps in. I can feel the queue forming behind me\
  \ and the eyes beginning to roll. \nA moment of clarity reaches me amidst my panicked\
  \ haze: I came prepared, had planned for this scenario. Having already reached the\
  \ conclusion that to reside here, you must be prepared to speak their language.\
  \ I took out my phrases, pasted on the screen of my phone and previously prepared\
  \ while I reviewed a map of my route into town. Taking a deep breath, I dove into\
  \ the task in hand.\nLike the captains of the old ships long before, I had planned\
  \ my expedition well, leaving triumphant, my lack of package proof of my success.\
  \ \nI had done it! Emerging unscathed from the depths of the post office, to the\
  \ flickering light of the mid-winter sun, I found a new world before my eyes. One\
  \ that I could begin to understand, and one that has stayed in my heart ever since.\n\
  \nIn the chilly mid-winter of the southern hemisphere, where the nights freeze you\
  \ and the mid-day sun sometimes burns you, I had found a world of contradictions.\
  \ People looked at you with curiosity, because foreign tourists were a rarity here.\
  \ Beauty could be found high up amongst the colourful graffiti, on a boat upon the\
  \ bay surrounded by seals, or in the chaos of a country I would never fully understand.\
  \ Perhaps that\u2019s why a part of my heart is reserved for Chile and its people:\
  \ I am like them. Once the country embraces you, it will never let you go.\n\nOn\
  \ this particular day, I found myself in the midst of the city, in a silent quarter\
  \ towards the west, beside a simple church, built and decorated in unfamiliar style.\n\
  I walked amongst the natives, who watched me with interest. A traveller, I walked\
  \ the stone steps to the entrance, a place to discover, soon swallowed by the embracing\
  \ silence of a place of worship."
