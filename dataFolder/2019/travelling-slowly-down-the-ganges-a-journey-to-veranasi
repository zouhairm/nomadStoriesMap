Text: "PLEASE NOTE!!! MY FIRST APPLICATION I INADVERTENTLY  POSTED THE WRONG PIECE!!\
  \ \n\n\nThe first sight of Varanasi or Banaras is nothing short of breathtaking.\
  \ The city itself seems to ascend defiantly out of the mighty Ganges River in a\
  \ crescent shape, hugging the shores like an ardent lover.\n Ancient Ghats, rise\
  \ out of the river and lead into a massive network of narrow lanes piled high with\
  \ a jumble of houses, temples, palaces and ashrams. The main Ghat, Dasashwamedh,\
  \ is the centre of all activity where hundreds of bodies are cremated each day,\
  \ the funeral pyres burning day and night.  As you walk through the lanes away from\
  \ the river it gets a little less crowded, though never quite enough to avoid the\
  \ insistent Varanasi entrepreneur who will try to sell you anything your heart desires.\n\
  At the main Ghats, bodies slowly disintegrate as they combust atop piles of burning\
  \ wood, the smoke creating a permanent haze that drifts lazily over the river. \u201C\
  All the time burning, never to be stopping\u201D my guide explained. Along this\
  \ stretch of the Ganges, are intricately shaped temples and steps leading down into\
  \ the water. Some are painted in bright colours alongside disused Maharajah\u2019\
  s palaces, dark and soot-stained standing like menacing sentinels overlooking the\
  \ river. \nAbove the Ghats, a building, filled to the brim with stacks of wood emaciated\
  \ men and women with thin, wispy grey hair, dressed in threadbare rags sit silently\
  \ in the semi-darkness in the hope of securing a few rupees to pay for the wood\
  \ for their own pyres.\nMy guide points to a small child of indeterminate age who\
  \ was obviously very sick and said, \u201CThis child cannot be burned, they be too\
  \ pure. They will put in a boat and then sink him in the river. Same for women who\
  \ being pregnant and holy men.  The families will make too much cry, it drives me\
  \ crazy.\u201D\nIt was as if I was in a surreal dream bearing witness to the awfulness\
  \ of life and death, both ugly and beautiful at the same time. The smoke billowing\
  \ up from the burning bodies a group of impish boys clad only in baggy underwear\
  \ joyfully dive and jump into the river squealing with delight seemingly oblivious\
  \ to the rituals goings on around them. Beggars, knee deep in the shallows pan for\
  \ gold hoping for a find of a gold tooth or a nose ring that might have been overlooked.\n\
  Wandering through the network of lanes above the river is a mesmerizing experience\
  \ as squeezed between houses that sit on top of one another are temples of indeterminate\
  \ antiquity. Sacred cows wander nonchalantly along the confined spaces oblivious\
  \ to my presence.\n By day the city\u2019s dirt is on full display. Cowpats and\
  \ goat pellets are everywhere. Garbage is often piled in the alleys where cows and\
  \ goats forage amongst it along with the rats that feed on the garbage and dogs\
  \ and cats that feed on the rats.\nEven so, Varanasi wears its grime with an outlandish\
  \ sense of pride.\nThe city is far more alluring at night where the dirt and grime\
  \ are hidden as the shadows descend, filling the alleys and lanes with darkness\
  \ punctuated here and there by pools of light spilling from open doorways. Men in\
  \ grubby silk shirts huddle on doorsteps, smoking cigarettes \u2013 murmuring in\
  \ low voices. The sound of bells and the pungent smell of incense guide me to its\
  \ origins.\nA group of seven young and impossibly good looking Hindu priests stand\
  \ on a raised dais above the shores of the river. In perfect harmony they perform\
  \ a set of intricate manoeuvres, twirling their candelabras, the flames creating\
  \ a whirlwind of patterns in the night sky. In perfect unison, they hoist and twirl\
  \ their lamps, spinning them at great speed never missing a beat as if all seven\
  \ were one. \nMeanwhile, the Ganges drifts by, a mass of dark water past towering\
  \ temples, playing host to several sadhus, sitting cross-legged and silent on the\
  \ steps. In the distance, the sound of tambourines, beaten by pious devotees keeping\
  \ watch over the burning Ghats. \nAnd this was but my first day!"
