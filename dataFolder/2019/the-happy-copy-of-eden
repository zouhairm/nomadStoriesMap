Text: "Sailing on a 5 star cruise my family and I got to know the B side of our own\
  \ country. \nOur journey began for my grandfathers 50th marriage anniversary. We\
  \ started in Punta Arenas, where we got aboard the cruise and became lost between\
  \ magical nature. It was just us and the world. There was no phone signal and no\
  \ wifi aboard.\nEvery morning we woke up, took breakfast and prepared ourselves\
  \ for a unique experience. We got on zodiac boats and the guides took us walking\
  \ and hiking by lots of outstanding islands, we even got a very close view of a\
  \ glaciar on one of those boats and we were surrounded by nothing more than the\
  \ silence and pieces of ice in the freezing water. At every island we got to know\
  \ about the flora and fauna of the austral zone of Chile meanwhile we took magical\
  \ pictures that contained every colour that anyone could imagine. Of course part\
  \ of the tour was dedicated to teach the group how to be ecological and how to take\
  \ care of the precious envirinment that we were standing on.\nWhile the trip kept\
  \ going, the cruise went through the Strait of magellan, passing through amazing\
  \ fiords and finally It passed through the Beagle channel. \nThe trip\u2019s objective\
  \ was to descend the cruise and put our tiny feet at the end of the gigantic world,\
  \ Cape Horn.\nThat day we were so anxious and nervous because we were ready with\
  \ our lifejackets on waiting for the captain to allow us to descend. Finally we\
  \ heard music in our ears when he said that climatic conditions were good enough\
  \ for us to descend. This was no joke. As happy as we could be we went to the top\
  \ of the island to get our picture and I can promise that in 5 minutes, we saw havy\
  \ rain, snow, sun and a very heavy wind.\nAfter we could take our photograph we\
  \ were recieved by a marine that was volunteering to live there for a year with\
  \ his family. We talked to him and he told us his hostile experience. His kids had\
  \ to go to school online with internet that came fron a very special satellite antena.\
  \ I thought \u201Che is a country heroe\u201D.\nWe went back to the cruise and descended\
  \ one more time in Magdalena Island where i made a lot of new friends. The were\
  \ little with feathers and the couldn\u2019t fly, but they were very good swimmers.\
  \ My penguin friends sent a very nice goodbye to us and to our trip. \nI was very\
  \ happy when we came back to Punta Arenas because i had countless of good memories\
  \ that will stay in my mind for life. I happily can say just as our national anthem\
  \ sais \u201Ces la copia feliz del Ed\xE9n\u201D that Chile and this zone speciffically\
  \ is the happy copy of Eden."
