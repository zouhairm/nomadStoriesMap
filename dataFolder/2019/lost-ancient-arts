Text: "Recently I visited chowmalla palace it\u2019s a fine structural palace build\
  \ by the Nizams of Hyderabad. The palace is unique for its style and elegance. Building\
  \ of the palace began in the late 18th century and over the decades a synthesis\
  \ of many architectural styles and influences emerged. \nBut nowadays we can\u2019\
  t see these types of art anywhere. No one can make these type of fine style work\
  \ anywhere. As the generation is changing nowadays we are losing the tradition,\
  \ art and architectural importance these days. People nowadays are not interested\
  \ in these places, even I didn\u2019t know there exist such fine architectural palace\
  \ in my city until I started searching for places to travel and take pictures of\
  \ these things, I was very happy to see such a beautiful work made by people those\
  \ days, very impressed by there work they are soo beautiful that u can\u2019t drop\
  \ off your eyes from them. I was even disappointed about how the government was\
  \ badly taking care of such fine art work do to lack of proper taking care of the\
  \ work, by not maintaining them properly. \nIf we go into the history the word chowmalla\
  \ means four palaces. The palace belongs to the Nizams of Hyderabad and was their\
  \ official residence while they ruled the state. It is said that the palace is modelled\
  \ on the Shah of Iran\u2019s palace in Tehran. Over the years of its expansion it\
  \ has absorbed various architecture of empires like Persian, Indo-Saracenic, Rajasthani\
  \ and European styles. The Khilwat Mubarak is the heart of Chowmahalla Palace. It\
  \ is held in high esteem by the people of Hyderabad, as it was the seat of the Asaf\
  \ Jahi dynasty. The grand pillared Durbar Hall has a pure marble platform on which\
  \ the Takht-e-Nishan or the royal seat was laid. Here the Nizams held their durbar\
  \ and other religious and symbolic ceremonies. Its side rooms today house historical\
  \ exhibits, arts and crafts, and exhibits of nizams' personal possessions. In the\
  \ southernmost courtyard is a priceless collection of carriages and vintage cars\
  \ including a 1911 yellow Rolls-Royce and 1937 Buick convertible. Each and every\
  \ corner of the palace you can find a fine beautiful architectural work done. I\
  \ wonder how many day, months or years it took by the artist/workers to complete\
  \ the architectural work because we know that it isn\u2019t easy making those work\
  \ with your own hand without any machine help. At last I want to say we have to\
  \ preserve these work and maintain them for future generations because am sure we\
  \ won\u2019t get these fine art work in future."
