Text: Travelling is like a train on a railway track once u are on wrong track it may
  lead u in a wrong cave which have nothing except darkness but if you are on the
  right railway track then it may lead you to heaven. When we are travelling we are
  that train apparently and natives of our visiting country's that train track we
  don't know them at all but one sight connection with others can change your whole
  life. It is same like love at first sight. When a child take his first breath without
  being aware of anything that's the exactly same feeling we have when we travel to
  a new place and the best thing about it stranger people care for us like nurses
  for an infant that's the connection which goes heart to heart ..sometimes there
  is time when we may have communication problems but when we speak with our heart
  than everything is crystal clear. "Travel the world like its the only thing in your
  life and let it lead you from nowhere to somewhere" in this road you will find so
  many people who will push you close to you destiny and those people always seeks
  for heart to heart connection and if you can make a local connection than you can
  win every projection of a country. Doesnt matter what you achieve in life unless
  there is no one to value it and to do so we always have to quest for a connection
  and once you tethered with it you will always have a connection with it ...this
  connection will lead you to new experience, loyalty , adventure and a new Relation
  these 4 elements in life are enough to understand why connection in life is necessary
  so do you have these elements or are you still in elementary school ?
