Text: "Before coming to Macao, I thought Macao is luxurious city. After coming here\
  \ I felt that Macao is also a quiet place. \nBecause I was an exchange student.\
  \ So On August 13, 2018, I took a flight from Hangzhou to Macao. Before arriving\
  \ on this land, My only impression of macao was the casino. My dad told me that\
  \ my maternal uncle had lost lots of money there. At the time I thought there must\
  \ be a paradise for the rich.\nThe feeling of macao was totally different from Hangzhou.\
  \ It was even more fascinating, probably because there were so many casinos, Macao\u2019\
  s most magnificent building were casinos, and most of the casinos were connected\
  \ to the shopping malls. Except the shopping malls, there were also many street\
  \ shops in macao. These two days we walked around but didn't dare to take a taxi.\
  \ It is too expensive. On the corner of the street ,Gucci and prada were forced\
  \ to squeeze together, it seemed that beside the price of the tag, there was nothing\
  \ to highlight its distinguished status. It seemed that Macao was like that. And\
  \ this thing I felt just after staying for more than a month, but I quickly changed\
  \ my mind cause of the experience of going out to watch a movie. \nActually The\
  \ University of macao arranged two host buddies for me. They were very friendly\
  \ and enthusiastic. Once, they asked me: cris, do you want to go to watch a movie\
  \ with us ? Just 30 macao pataca for a ticket, I was shocked that , is there such\
  \ a cheap movie ticket in macao? I immediately agreed. The name of this cinema hall\
  \ and as well as the price of ticket was amazing , it called Love Cinema, The movie\
  \ I watched was called Happy Lazaro, that was a french movie . When we came out\
  \ of the theater, I was still recalling the scene of the movie. The film ended with\
  \ a tragedy, but it is often a tragedy which makes people to think. When we came\
  \ out, it was very late. The often crowded Ruins of St. Paul was cold and deserted.\
  \ At this time, I saw the other side of the city. Before, the street which used\
  \ to be full of people became empty, and the moonlight pulled the shadows of people\
  \ much longer. We walked on the short paved stones road. Compared to the dazzling\
  \ casinos which were separated by few streets, it looked so quiet there, which made\
  \ us feel relaxed. On an inconspicuous street corner, I saw a old granny sitting\
  \ alone outside the door, she just sat quietly outside the door. The shop she was\
  \ in was the only one in the nearby street that lit the lights. I don't know what\
  \ she is looking at, I don't know what she is thinking. The old granny found us\
  \ and started chatting with us in Cantonese. The general meaning should be to ask\
  \ why we are still outside so late, and we must pay attention to safety and the\
  \ like.\n\"I feel that the grandmother is a little lonely.\" I told my buddy.\n\"\
  Maybe.\" he replied."
