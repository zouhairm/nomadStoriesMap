Text: "The day had finally come, and I still did not have a chance to think of what\
  \ I was about to do. Six days walking and camping in the backlands of Brazil. 160\
  \ km in unknown and almost uninhabited lands with 49 other walkers, who I had never\
  \ seen, or even talked to before. It had been a hectic semester at university with\
  \ long hours in front of a computer screen or inside a classroom. I submitted all\
  \ my articles, packed my backpack and went to the bus station. While I looked at\
  \ all those high-rise buildings, the flashing lights, the cars honking while the\
  \ bus left Belo Horizonte, a city with 2.5 million inhabitants, and started to imagine\
  \ what my experience would be like. The trillion images and possibilities that crossed\
  \ my mind made me incredibly astonished and exhausted at the same time. I closed\
  \ my eyes and slept for 10 hours.\nI woke up with the bus dropping us in Riachinho,\
  \ a tiny village that received their few visitors with a bar with a shabby snooker\
  \ table rather than a bus station. From there, an old Kombi took us to Sagarana,\
  \ from where the walk started. I was still trying to process how we survived the\
  \ adventurous driving on the dirt road, how soil could be so orange and dusty, why\
  \ it was boiling hot in July, and who those fifty different faces were. Finding\
  \ no answers to my numerous questions I just followed the flow and walked with the\
  \ others to an immense geodesic dome made out of bamboo. We all sat in a circle\
  \ and listened to what each walker had to say. They were talking about looking for\
  \ life experience, for spiritual guidance, for new friends. I couldn\u2019t really\
  \ pay attention to what they were saying. I was too anxious trying to come up with\
  \ a magnificent speech to say when it would be my turn to stand there in the middle.\
  \ Of course, I didn\u2019t think of anything. And, as soon as I was in the spot,\
  \ everything went black and all I could say was \u201CI\u2019m not looking for anything,\
  \ but I expect to find a lot\u201D. It was true. And people liked it. I loved it\
  \ and embraced the sentence during my entire journey. \nWe camped under the stars,\
  \ and, sometimes, on top of very hungry termites. The heat was intense. We had no\
  \ shower, no toilet and not a very rich diet. We had what was necessary to live.\
  \ All of these made the encounters we had on the way even more valuable. The old\
  \ lady telling stories about her past and beautifully pointing out they were just\
  \ remaining leaves of a tree that was drying out. The activist man using unproductive\
  \ lands from big farmers to start new egalitarian societies. That little stray dog\
  \ that followed us for all those kilometres. The beautiful woman whose green eyes\
  \ made me rethink the meaning of relationships. The happy teacher in the middle\
  \ of nowhere who showed me storytelling is a brilliant and meaningful form of education.\
  \ The photographer who taught me how to find beauty in sadness. The Christian researcher\
  \ who taught me religion can also bring good stuff. The old man who let us pick\
  \ juicy oranges from his garden. The huge parrots flying just above my head. The\
  \ kind guide who cried when he saw that part of the native vegetation had become\
  \ soya plantation. The amazing doctor who showed me that a healthy mind is indeed\
  \ more important than a healthy body.\nOn the last, day each walker was given an\
  \ amulet with a different extract from the book The Devil to Pay in the Backlands,\
  \ written by Guimar\xE3es Rosa. In mine it was written \u201CSert\xE3o \u2013 they\
  \ say -, when trying to look for it, you never find it. Suddenly, by chance, when\
  \ we are not expecting, sert\xE3o comes.\u201D In Portuguese, \u201Csert\xE3o\u201D\
  \ refers to this remote region in Brazil that I travelled to. But \u201Cser t\xE3\
  o\u201D means \u201Cto be so\u201D. And that was what the walk meant to me. To be,\
  \ so intensively, a bit of everything."
