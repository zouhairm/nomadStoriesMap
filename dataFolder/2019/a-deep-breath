Text: "It was barely dawn when I shuffled out the door of my tiny hostel in Ao Nang\
  \ which was nestled in an uncommonly quiet alley. It was isolated from the shouts\
  \ of shop keepers, the bustle of \"farang\" bars with their overpriced beers and\
  \ loud western music, and the constant hum of scooters and tour buses speeding down\
  \ the main road. \n\nThe little beach town was still asleep as I reached the rough\
  \ concrete seawall and looked out on the blush of a Thai sunrise over the Andaman\
  \ Sea. The towering limestone cliffs in the distance felt like scattered lighthouses\
  \ in the vast and endless water, making the dark waves feel enticing and familiar.\
  \ \n\nI was alone. I arrived in Thailand five months before with a partner with\
  \ whom I shared the jetlag, the novelty of new experiences, the terrifying moment\
  \ of crossing a street in Bangkok, and the hilarity that comes from struggling with\
  \ language and cultural barriers. After months of trying to adapt, it was clear\
  \ this side of the world was too unfamiliar for him. He decided to return to the\
  \ comfort of the States, leaving me behind. So here I was on Christmas day, breathing\
  \ in the salt and sea, trying to find a lifeline and direction for the new year.\
  \ \n\nSuddenly, I hear \u201CMiss, sawadee khrap!\u201D I turn to find a waving\
  \ tuk-tuk driver who was here to whisk me away to the boat for my day-long scuba\
  \ excursion under that welcoming water. I stood up, brushed the sand from my hands,\
  \ and happily folded myself into the open-air taxi. After a few moments, I realized\
  \ I was beaming alongside the rising sun thinking of adventure ahead. \n\nIt can\
  \ be challenging to find instant community abroad, however instead of needing a\
  \ language, scuba divers can share the calling for the depths and unknown. They\
  \ are comfortable with the possibility, risk, and improvisation. They let nature\
  \ decide how the day will go and respect the outcome without question. I clambered\
  \ onboard, nestled into a beanbag on the top deck, and was immediately welcomed\
  \ by my fellow divers. Each sunkissed face showed a mix of excitement and ease,\
  \ a confidence that the day will be nothing but perfect. \n\nAs I let the air out\
  \ of my BCD and slowly descended on the first of three dives, a shipwreck 63 meters\
  \ below the surface, I panicked as the jagged cliffs of Koh Phi Phi blurred from\
  \ view. I last dove 10 years ago. Will I remember how to do this? What if my mask\
  \ fills with water or I have too much weight? I continued to sink\u2026 5 meters\
  \ down, then 10, then 20, and it\u2019s all ok\u2014the endless blue embraces me,\
  \ and I am reminded of the unique tranquility of the deep. With each exhale, jellyfish-like\
  \ bubbles float to the surface, carrying a little piece of fear away from me.  I\
  \ recall how to breathe evenly, how to equalize the pressure, and how to enjoy the\
  \ colorful chaos of this otherworldly experience.  \n\nAfter surfacing from the\
  \ last dive, I realized how much I needed this-- to submit to nature and let things\
  \ chart their own course. I had been too concerned with planning, predicting, and\
  \ forcing positive outcomes from my new situation that I was unable to enjoy the\
  \ incredible adventure on which I embarked many months ago. I clambered gracelessly\
  \ back onto the boat, shed my tank, BCD, fins, mask, and weights. I peeled off my\
  \ wetsuit and joined the other divers on the upper deck, who were happily chatting\
  \ in a patchwork of languages about their experiences under the surface."
