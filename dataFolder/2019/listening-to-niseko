Text: "When I got on my last flight to Niseko, the infamous ski destination for adrenaline\
  \ seekers and powder hounds, I\u2019d be lying if I said images of me hurtling through\
  \ waist deep powder weren't running through my head.\n\nWith an impressive annual\
  \ snowfall of 14 meters, thanks to the seasonal winds from Siberia, I was ready\
  \ for an action packed trip. I had prepared myself for the powder playground. I\
  \ bought a subscription to \u2018Backcountry Magazine\u2019, splurged on a second\
  \ hand GoPro and started following exercise regimes that pro-skiers and snowboarders\
  \ recommend. Having basically memorised the ski resort map, all 61 of its on-piste\
  \ runs and 11 backcountry gates, it was all I could talk about.  \n\nBut then I\
  \ went silent.\n\nOn day one me and my roommates had woken up at 7am, stopped off\
  \ at Seico-Mart to buy some sandwiches for lunch and prepared to ride all day. We\
  \ stood in line for first lifts, determined to make the most of the fresh 25cm of\
  \ \u2018champagne\u2019 snow Niseko had received overnight. I was giddy. Behind\
  \ us were groups that consisted of mostly Aussies all escaping the scorching heat\
  \ for some snow. \n\n3 laps down, my confidence was soaring. Then I hit the ground.\
  \ Hard.\n\n\u201CCall ski patrol, her arms pretty banged up.\u201D \n\nIt was the\
  \ first time I\u2019d ever broken anything. The Japanese medic team arrived promptly;\
  \ in their red and black uniforms, whistles blowing they carried me off on a fluorescent\
  \ clad snowmobile. Hours later when I received pain killers a Japanese nurse with\
  \ cheeks like peaches, asked me what my pain was on a scale of 1 to 10. I feebly\
  \ responded with a soft 5, although it felt a strong 8. After the days ordeal, feeling\
  \ deflated, nauseous and relatively despondent, when my roommates asked if I wanted\
  \ to drink away the woes at \u2018Wild Bills\u2019 I shrugged them off and went\
  \ to bed. \n\nI was heartbroken. My trip was ruined. Niseko was wasted on me. \n\
  \nTwo days nursing my pride and pity in my claustrophobic bunk bed, I decided it\
  \ was time to get out. My first stop, Seico-mart for some nourishment. This time\
  \ I wasn't rushing to grab whatever looked familiar and get to the slopes. I settled\
  \ on an tuna-mayo Inagiri, a traditional Japanese sushi snack food. A burley American\
  \  behind me chuckled, \u201CGood luck unwrapping that bad boy.\u201D I was confused,\
  \ it looked harmless. But he was right, the deceptive snack was packed in a maze\
  \ of plastic. It required opening three separate sections in a specific sequence,\
  \ in order to keep the crispy seaweed from being ripped away from the rice. I later\
  \ discovered this was to keep the seaweed from going soggy. Attention to detail.\
  \ That must be the mantra of Japan. \n\nStomach satisfied I hopped onto a bus to\
  \ the connecting town, Kutchan-cho. 300 Yen later I was roaming the streets searching\
  \ for Shu Ogawara Museum of Art. Nobody seemed to know the place I had read about.\
  \ Relatively lost, wading through the quiet snowy streets, I built up the courage\
  \ to ask a Japanese gentleman walking his slightly overweight pug. \n\n\u201COhayo\
  \ gozaimasu, sumimasen Art Gallery?\u201D\n\nBlushing, he nodded to my right. Tucked\
  \ behind a sea of frosted trees was a charcoal rectangular building with a massive\
  \ glass door. As I walked towards the gallery along the path that ran like a river\
  \ through the miniature forrest, I paused to take a photo. Before I reached for\
  \ my camera I realised how wonderfully quiet it was. Under a canopy of barren branches,\
  \ laced with snow I took a moment to absorb the strange world around me.\n\nIt\u2019\
  s rare to find places where all you can hear is your own breathe and the crinkle\
  \ of snow under your feet. \nNiseko wasn\u2019t just an action packed ski resort\
  \ filled with Westerners. Long before it reached the world stage it was a modest\
  \ and quirky Japanese town. \n\nOnly when I was quiet, could I really listen to\
  \ what Niseko had to say."
