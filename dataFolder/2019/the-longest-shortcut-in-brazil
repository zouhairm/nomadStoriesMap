Text: "\u2018\u2018Let\u2019s take a shortcut and go north\u2019, suggested excitedly\
  \ by my Brazilian roommates. I hesitated at first but then agreed only because I\
  \ thought travelling with locals I have a safety net. Little did I know that we\
  \ would be entering into the unknown, turning our shortcut into a four day adventure\
  \ full of surprises.\n\nWhen it was time to leave the tranquil isolated coastal\
  \ town of Jericoacoara, we had two choices. Backtrack south down the beach to Prea/Jijoca\
  \ in order to catch the comfortable highway bus to the next major town north called\
  \ Sao Luis. Or head directly north along the beach to the first bus station. We\
  \ estimated it was going to save us two to four hours travelling time. \n\nWhy not\
  \ try this idea of taking the road less travelled. However, we never imagined that\
  \ the shortcut would take four days instead of fifteen hours, using seven different\
  \ modes of transport. \n\nA friend of the Brazilians offered to drive us to Tabajuda\
  \ in his Landrover for a small fee. It was a short ride along the beach, whizzing\
  \ by dead tree stumps protruding along the water\u2019s edge.\n\nEventually we were\
  \ stopped by a river. We waved goodbye to our Landrover man as we hopped into a\
  \ little canoe to cross the river. Conveniently waiting on the other side were beach\
  \ buggies, ready to negotiate a deal to take us to Camocim. \n\nAlong the way, we\
  \ got side-tracked as the driver insisted we spend a little time in Ilha Amor instead\
  \ of going directly into town. A five minute walk behind the baraccas (beach bars)\
  \ and over a hill is a colony of lagoons nestled in-between the pure white coloured\
  \ sand dunes. So impressive and inviting, we just couldn\u2019t resist a swim in\
  \ the fresh water pools. We then paid the driver extra to drive the buggy through\
  \ the second river and directly into Camocim bus station.\n\nLuckily we grabbed\
  \ the last regular bus for the three hour ride to Parnaiba, but could go no further.\
  \ So we booked into a local pousada. The owners of a nearby restaurant fed us so\
  \ well with sizzling steak and potatoes. They became friendly and chatty with my\
  \ Brazilian friends. Of course I couldn\u2019t do any talking but the owners liked\
  \ us so much that they gave us extra food and then treated us a city tour by night\
  \ in their family car. Parnaiba is a cute town with a colourful and quaint port\
  \ area. \n\nThe next morning we could have taken a regular bus for the remaining\
  \ journey but the restaurant owners convinced us to depart by boat. By now I had\
  \ lost my inhibition to travel into the unknown. \n\nWe rented a hammock on the\
  \ top deck for the seven hour journey to Tutioa and watched the greenery and small\
  \ villages float by. As we arrived in the evening, we accepted the captains offer\
  \ to sleep on board in our hammocks for free instead of paying for a pousada.\n\n\
  The next morning, awoken by the sun, a noisy street market and the smell of fish,\
  \ we quickly organised a 4WD transfer to Cabure - the scenic way. Driving on unpaved\
  \ bumpy roads for 2.5 hours, the scenery was amazing. Lush green forests dotted\
  \ with bright white sand dunes! \n\nWe had to leave the rustic beach village by\
  \ hiring a speedboat. It cost us more but we couldn\u2019t wait until 4am for the\
  \ regular ferry to Barreirinhas. A definite must is to visit the Lencois Maranheses\
  \ National Park. We were wowed when we come across miles and miles of sand dunes\
  \ in the middle of a huge lush forest. We spent hours swimming in all the natural\
  \ lagoons nestled in-between. It felt out of this world.\n\nThen for the last section,\
  \ we reluctantly took an uninteresting regular bus to Sao Luis! \n\nMy Brazilian\
  \ roommates and the four day short cut taught me to never be afraid stepping into\
  \ the unknown in anything I do. The thought of the unknown is much scarier than\
  \ actually living in it \u2013 no matter how long it takes! I now love travelling\
  \ without a plan, so that every day is a surprise."
