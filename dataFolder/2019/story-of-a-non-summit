Text: "Dangling 1,000 feet in the air, one hand hauling up a rope, and the other strategically\
  \ draping the rope\u2019s slack over my legs, I struggled to find a comfortable\
  \ position to hang in my sweat-soaked harness. The rope cascaded over my legs as\
  \ I belayed my partner up a seemingly featureless vertical corner. \n\nRotating\
  \ my hanging body clockwise, I awkwardly leaned my left side on the sun-heated rock.\
  \ I was surrounded by mountains--jagged peaks and steep spires. Silhouettes of palm\
  \ trees sprouted along limestone ridges. I looked out at this beautiful park, \u201C\
  El Potrero Chico,\u201D or, the \u201Clittle corral,\u201D as many folks have nicknamed\
  \ it. Formed from the erosion of a doubly plunging anticline, Potrero Chico is a\
  \ unique geological area consisting of an oblong ring of mountains with a prominent\
  \ canyon cut into it. Vertical streaks of limestone and dolomite soar up thousands\
  \ of feet. Potrero Chico may not be the everyday tourist destination, but for rock\
  \ climbers like me, this place is a paradise.\n\nMy eyes skimmed the remaining 1,300\
  \ feet of wall above. \u201C13 more pitches,\u201D I thought. I was giddy with the\
  \ thought of making it to the summit. My partner, Kerry, and I had climbed a 800\
  \ feet route the day prior, which took a total of 7 hours. At that rate, this route,\
  \ which was 23 pitches, would take us almost 21 hours. We optimistically disregarded\
  \ this calculation, attributing our slow pace to \u201Ctaking our time,\u201D \u201C\
  poor rope management\u201D, and lots of pee breaks. Convinced that we could be more\
  \ efficient, we woke up at 4am the next day to start our 23-pitch journey. But as\
  \ I rested on top of the tenth pitch, belaying Kerry up, I started to doubt. The\
  \ noon-rising sun beamed down harshly, as if flashing a giant warning sign. A heavy\
  \ disappointment sank into my gut.\n\n\u201CYou got it, Kerry!\u201D I yelled down\
  \ encouragingly, as her weight pulled down on the climbing rope. The tension of\
  \ rope released and I took in more rope as she ascended a few more feet. I heard\
  \ the remnants of an echo. She must have shouted at the top of her lungs, but the\
  \ wind swallowed most of her words. Her weight pulled heavy onto the anchor system.\
  \ Minutes passed. Eventually, the force released and there was more slack to pull\
  \ up and coil over my legs. I was relieved when I heard her grunting and cursing\
  \ more clearly. \n\nI looked down and could see Kerry\u2019s helmet bob over the\
  \ edge. As she thrusted her leg over the roof, she took a deep breath and exclaimed,\
  \ \u201CHoly moly girl. That was crazy!\u201D I watched as she climbed the last\
  \ ten feet, her fingertips gently pulling down on the slim sharp edges. She smeared\
  \ her feet against granular imperfections, trusting that the friction would be enough\
  \ to keep her on the wall. \u201CWoohoo!\u201D I cried, as she scrambled up to the\
  \ right of me. \n\nWe high-fived and cheered and took a moment to recap the technical\
  \ moves from the last pitch. \nWe laughed at the chalk on our faces and the fact\
  \ that we forgot to put sunscreen on our backs. \u201CThat was epic!\u201D I exclaimed,\
  \ with a big fat smile on my face. Kerry responded with a loud warrior cry that\
  \ echoed throughout the valley. I was reminded of why I love climbing, why I love\
  \ being outside. It rejuvenates my soul. A small hot breeze sighed on my cheeks.\
  \ As I took a giant inhale, I realized that I couldn\u2019t help but be completely\
  \ and utterly happy in that moment.\n\nAs we journeyed down, I kept looking up at\
  \ the summit. We weren\u2019t going to summit that day, but my heavy disappointment\
  \ began to fade. I looked over at Kerry and we laughed at our sunburnt shoulders.\
  \ We promised each other that we would come back next year. We didn\u2019t make\
  \ it to the top, but we had a blast trying. I reminded myself of a quote a good\
  \ friend once shared with me, \u201CIt is good to have an end to journey, but it\
  \ is the journey that matters in the end.\u201D -Ursula K. Le Guin."
