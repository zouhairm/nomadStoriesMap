Text: "I bagged a bottle of water, 2 pair of cozy jeans, a bermuda and last but not\
  \ the least courage for overcoming little nervousness. My parents had just reached\
  \ home and may be about to call me to assure I was home too. To make them aware\
  \ of my upcoming jaunt could have been a potential threat to the entire plan. Thanks\
  \ to my packed up bag which was in their bedroom, and if I had to get that damn\
  \ bag I sure would have been checked and caught, and receive a huge no because all\
  \ they cared was safety for me being their \"ultra protective 200 lbs child\". I\
  \ payed the price, dropped my luggage, set my bike and off I went towards the destination.\
  \ No companion, a half charged phone, money that cold be spent right away in a matter\
  \ of a day and of course no luggage. The sound perception of reaching the designation\
  \ was endowed to me by my creator. It was a huge 2 days of gala where at least more\
  \ than half a million people gathered to listen to the divine preach of the scholars.\
  \ Holding an of array of what-ifs I reached and saw the place bustling where as\
  \ the mic was already taken incharge of by a renowned speaker. The weather in Bangalore\
  \ was dead cold and the sun was about to rest for the day, I was convinced my body\
  \ can absorb that amount of winter and stay lively because the setting sun until\
  \ then indicated signs of no bitterness from the weather. It was 11:30 pm and the\
  \ lights were shutting down one by one alarming everyone to sleep. Not a single\
  \ human present there could seen without a baggage. All set to sleep.\n\nBut may\
  \ be half an hour later even those who were covered with a blanket were shivering,\
  \ changing positions and struggling to sleep. Wearing a kurta over a full sleeve\
  \ T-shirt I snuggled, wrapped myself and tried sleeping. The entire picture seemed\
  \ like the last scenes from the movie Titanic where Leonardo DiCaprio gets frozen\
  \ to meet lord. Only thing different was I didn't die. After a long while a person\
  \ sleeping next to me in the canopy offered me his bedsheet and went out for a walk\
  \ with his friend because I kept hearing him saying \"no way we can lie down to\
  \ sleep, let's give him this bedsheet\". And for a man who is sinking a small baby\
  \ tube is enough to hold on to. I thanked him and slept around 2:30 am. Woke up\
  \ and got done with the morning prayer, met a couple of people I knew and exchanged\
  \ greetings and set myself again for a lonely wandering. I wasn't so tired and so\
  \ I roamed around searching for people I knew and jeepers creepers! I bumped into\
  \ my good friend and narrated him the story, he then praised my courage jokingly\
  \ and offered me his cozy mattress to sleep. Ah! I was knocked out so swiftly to\
  \ sleep. \n\nMoments later he seemed to have received a call from his friend to\
  \ pick him up from his place and bring him to the larger than life canopy we were\
  \ staying in. We were three, he took his car, and my mind gave a me an idea of taking\
  \ my bike along so that I could drop it and come back with them. I was subtly distracted\
  \ and I didn't take my bike. On our return I had to use the washroom to only come\
  \ out after a few minutes to see nobody I knew was there. I was glad I skipped taking\
  \ my bike. Because by that period of time my phone was absolutely unresponsive,\
  \ so no chance of contact through radiations any more. That was the last day there,\
  \ I had surplus amount of energy and patience by God's grace without food. Soon\
  \ after 10 pm we were allowed to leave the place. The crowd was obviously overboard,\
  \ to reach the parking lot took a dog's age. \nReached home finally, \nand realized\
  \ when the heart wants to fly, \nKeeping it in the confinement named dependency,\n\
  Is such an act of sly."
