Text: "The cab fare amounted to 56.56 Lira\u200A\u2014\u200Aas displayed on the BiTaksi\
  \ app\u200A\u2014\u200Aand my father fished out a note of 50 Lira from his wallet\
  \ before handing it over to the driver. And just when Baba proceeded to take out\
  \ the remaining amount, the tall, stout man\u200A\u2014\u200Ain his mid-thirties\u200A\
  \u2014\u200Alifted a palm to convey that he wouldn\u2019t have to pay the rest of\
  \ the fare. And this was after he helped my mother\u200A\u2014\u200Awho was then\
  \ diagnosed with lumbar spondylosis\u200A\u2014\u200Aget into the car for an entirety\
  \ of 3 minutes, turning the key in the ignition only after making sure that she\
  \ was seated comfortably. This was after he (not knowing the exact destination otherwise)\
  \ studied the GPS thoroughly and drove along the long, steep slopes of cobbled roads\u200A\
  \u2014\u200Aone adept hand on the steering wheel, the other clasping the phone,\
  \ a pair of astute hazel eyes switching back and forth between the road and the\
  \ mobile screen\u200A\u2014\u200Auntil we arrived at our destination in Hoca Pa\u015F\
  a.\nThe above event, however, was a sequel to an act of astounding generosity we\
  \ witnessed and received upon our arrival at the Ataturk Airport. Clad in a grey\
  \ t-shirt and a pair of blue denims, the strikingly tall young man pushed my mother\
  \ in the wheelchair\u200A\u2014\u200Aas he was assigned to do\u200A\u2014\u200A\
  and while doing so, he repeatedly leaned over to ask her if she was \u2018ok\u2019\
  , \u2018ok\u2019 being one of the fewest English words he was acquainted with. The\
  \ language barrier between us did not seem to deter him from striking up a conversation\
  \ with me, both of us resorting to nods, wild hand gestures, simple English monosyllables.\
  \ But after a couple of minutes, albeit to my shame, I almost gave up on holding\
  \ the conversation further when I utterly failed to comprehend a question he was\
  \ trying to ask me. So, I focused my attention strictly on the baggage carousel\
  \ when I finally spotted one of our two checked-in bags on the belt. But before\
  \ I could even proceed to collect it, he outran me and took hold of the bag before\
  \ smoothly mounting the ridiculously heavy item on the luggage cart. And this time,\
  \ I couldn\u2019t refrain myself from acknowledging his benign presence, giving\
  \ him a meek smile to thank him. Determined to make me understand his lingering\
  \ query, he then held up his phone to show me his question typed out and translated\
  \ in English on Google Translate. \u201CHow you go to hotel,\u201D it read. Mistaking\
  \ my initial silence \u2013 stemming from a bewildered appreciation for his effort\
  \ - as another failure to decipher his question, he proceeded to type again. Collecting\
  \ myself, I finally managed to answer his query to his satisfaction. Clearly happy\
  \ with his endeavour being a success, he then relied on the good ol\u2019 Google\
  \ Translate to ask me several other questions, mumbling and fumbling with his attempt\
  \ to guide me on transport, safe corners of the city, tourist SIM cards and more\
  \ until he carefully and patiently led my mother into our pre-booked cab stationed\
  \ outside the airport. \nAnd just when my cynical self presumed that this journey\
  \ couldn\u2019t get any better, our lady luck brought us in the company of the wonderful\
  \ staff of the hotel we stayed in\u200A\u2014\u200Aone of them being Nadir, who\
  \ introduced us to the unforgettable Turkish tea. A voracious reader, Nadir would\
  \ sit down with me and my father during the evenings and hold these long chat sessions\
  \ on Victor Hugo, Dickens, Orhan Pamuk and Turkish politics over multiple glasses\
  \ of Turkish tea. The other English-speaking member of the staff, Ibrahim would\
  \ gush over Bollywood while occasionally crooning songs from some iconic Hindi films.\
  \ And all thanks to these two golden souls, we toured the city extensively sans\
  \ the aid of a tour guide. One could say that this hotel was a lot more than Airbnb\
  \ and a little less than home.\nIn fact, upon our departure we realized that kindness\
  \ is where Istanbul is and a 700 word essay is not enough to illustrate the abundance\
  \ of benevolence residing in a city that rests unthreateningly on the crux of modernization\
  \ and humanity.\nTe\u015Fekk\xFCr ederim, Istanbul!"
