Text: "As I walked through the airport doors in New Delhi, the hot, humid air engulfed\
  \ me. Someone stared at me hard from across the street, near the taxi line. Then,\
  \ someone else. Before I knew it, everyone was staring.\n\nMy stomach lurched. Had\
  \ I made a mistake in choosing India for getting my yoga certification? Everyone\
  \ back home had nothing but negative things to say. They\u2019d been afraid for\
  \ me.\n\nWere they right? Was this a stupid idea? Had I finally pushed my passion\
  \ for exploring too far?\n\nI\u2019d traveled to third-world countries before, but\
  \ I was shocked that day. There were kids darting across multiple highway lanes.\n\
  \nMy driver was narrowly avoiding them. The living conditions were heart-breaking;\
  \ trash was piled up everywhere.\n\nWhen I finally arrived at my hostel, my emotions\
  \ were abounding. I was nervous, stressed, and uncomfortable. Then, I met people\
  \ in the lobby who changed everything.\n\nUpon speaking with locals and other friendly\
  \ travelers, I learned a lot. This shameless staring was not because I was a girl\
  \ traveling alone. It was simply due to how different we travelers looked.\n\nPeople\
  \ in many areas of India simply don\u2019t see a lot of white people walking around.\
  \ This was an important lesson. It reaffirmed my decision, and my love for traveling\
  \ and understanding different cultures.\n\nMy next stop was Rishikesh, a lush, northern\
  \ city serving as a gateway to the Himalayas. It\u2019s a pretty big yoga hub, so\
  \ it wasn\u2019t necessarily \u2018the path less traveled\u2019 I\u2019d fantasized\
  \ about.\n\nThat didn\u2019t undermine my experience, though. It was the very thing\
  \ bringing so many different souls together\u2014like a big universal magnet. It\
  \ allowed me to meet people from all walks of life.\n\nThe yoga school was deep,\
  \ spiritual, and raw. The swami and gurus cultivated experiences that were aimed\
  \ at breaking down our walls and peeling back our layers.\n\nThe techniques we explored\
  \ focused on working through emotional blockage. They chipped away at the accumulated\
  \ weights and burdens, not only from past traumas and pains, but from everyday life.\n\
  \nNear the end of the course, we all gathered around an elevated cushion where we\
  \ took turns sitting, answering questions from the rest of the group.\nSomeone always\
  \ asked the person in the chair the same thing: \u201CWhat did you learn from your\
  \ time here?\u201D\n\nOne particular girl in the course suffered from an auto-immune\
  \ disease and had very little hair left on her head.\n\nShe always seemed to be\
  \ self-conscious, trying to cover the balding spots. She would put her hair in a\
  \ ponytail most of time.\n\nEventually, she got this beautiful headscarf from the\
  \ markets that she clearly felt more confident and lovely in.\n\nWhat she didn\u2019\
  t realize was that no one saw her sickness. We embraced her for her kindness and\
  \ humor. She had pretty, crystal blue eyes and the personality to match. That was\
  \ what I saw.\n\nWhen it was her turn to answer the question, she explained that\
  \ she\u2019d come to try and learn a naturopathic way to heal herself.\n\nVoice\
  \ breaking and tears welling in her eyes, she said that instead, she\u2019d gotten\
  \ something better\u2014she had gained acceptance. \n\nShe\u2019d learned to love\
  \ herself, disease and all. There weren\u2019t many dry eyes in the ashram.\n\n\
  For my part, that month had given me the tools to be a better person. It was the\
  \ best experience I\u2019ve ever had.\n\nI chose that specific course to try and\
  \ open myself up; I wanted to be able to connect with people again. I was tired\
  \ of being emotionally broken.\n\nLeaving that ashram, I felt more light-hearted\
  \ than I had since I was a child. Now, I\u2019m determined to create that feeling\
  \ for as many people as I can.\n\nI\u2019ve always known I wanted to be a writer.\
  \ When I realized I wanted to positively impact people somehow, I thought that skill\
  \ was my only tool of doing so.\n\nAfter my experience in India, I know that I want\
  \ to positively influence people through yoga and meditation as well. I\u2019ve\
  \ seen its effects firsthand, and they\u2019re truly amazing.\n\nI went to India\
  \ to become a yoga instructor, but I never expected to find my purpose in life,\
  \ too."
