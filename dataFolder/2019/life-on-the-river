Text: "Much later, while walking the Portuguese seashore or hiking the Donegal mountains,\
  \ I'd look out past the horizon hoping for a glimpse of the Colombian coast. If\
  \ I could see the foam rising from the Caribbean, almost concealing the golden specks\
  \ of sand then logically I could see the Sierra Nevada mountains. After, I just\
  \ needed to squint a little more. Past the valleys, over the Andes and across the\
  \ Amazon rainforest. And there, with one foot in Brazil and one in Colombia, grasping\
  \ a machine gun, would be Mario. \n\nWould he still be as nervous as he was that\
  \ first night we met? Was he still dreaming of Europe? \n\nWe had taken a cargo\
  \ slow boat out of the Peruvian town of Iquitos and were headed to the Colombian\
  \ border. Flown in, sailed out. There was no other way. \n\nAmongst crowded hammock\
  \ beds, flying beetles and floating suitcases the man with auburn eyes lit cigarette\
  \ after cigarette.\n\nI had seen him the previous night, standing on the pier as\
  \ he embraced a young woman and the infant in her arms. And again the next morning\
  \ as we all leaned over the rusted railings to watch the deckhands grimace and strain\
  \ as they pulled a cow aboard. The workers bare feet slipping and sliding as four\
  \ stubborn hooves stood firm. \n\nThat evening as I stood on deck watching the orange\
  \ globe slipping beyond the horizon, the man poked his cigarette at me.\n\n\"You\u2019\
  re European?\"\n\n\"Yes. Irish. How did you know?\"\n\n\"You were speaking French\
  \ to your girlfriend. Je parle un petit peu Fran\xE7ais.\"\n\nHe told me his name\
  \ was Mario and he motioned to a group of men sitting on the floor as they slung\
  \ money and cards down. They were part of a group of new police officers traveling\
  \ to their post on the border. The pretend was going to be replaced with the real.\
  \ I asked if life was calmer since Colombia's peace agreement with FARC. He shook\
  \ his head.\n\n\u201CDrug traffickers with guns, submarines carrying cocaine. That's\
  \ life on the river\u201D, he said.\n\nHis smooth skin belied the obvious toughness\
  \ but the dreamer in him still shone through.\n\n\u201COne day I will visit France\
  \ but for now..\u201D\n\nHe rubbed his index and thumb together, \u201CDinero. In\
  \ Peru, it\u2019s complicated\u201D.\n\nHe was being kind. My two day old Peruvian\
  \ newspaper spoke of embezzlement, bribery and cheating coming out of faraway Lima.\
  \  \n\nHe was silent for some time as he pulled on his cigarette.\n\n\u201CWhy didn\u2019\
  t you and your girlfriend take the fast boat to Leticia?\u201D\n\nI told him we\
  \ wanted to travel slow, to not feel the pressure of time, to experience the Amazon.\
  \ It all sounded so superfluous now but he seemed to understand. He asked if I\u2019\
  d seen the spectacle earlier that day.\n\n\u201CIn two days, they will do another\
  \ 3-day journey back to Peru. More animals, more cargo, more lifting. And two days\
  \ after that again. And two days after that. The fittest work without a break for\
  \ as long as they can. The teenagers can go several months. Can you imagine?\u201D\
  \n\n\u201CLife on the river\u201D I said and he nodded.\n\nI asked about the woman\
  \ I saw him embracing.\n \n\u201CMy girlfriend and son.\u201D \n\nHe hoped to have\
  \ holidays in a few months to see them for his 22nd birthday but it wasn\u2019t\
  \ promised. He dreamed to take them to Paris to see the Eiffel Tower.\n\n\u201C\
  I don\u2019t think I\u2019d like the cheese but the wine would be great\u201D he\
  \ smiled.\n\n\u201CAnd the cognac\u201D I agreed.\n\nAnd for a moment we let that\
  \ image hang there.\n\nIt was getting too dark to see and it wouldn\u2019t be long\
  \ until the flying beetles returned so we agreed to speak more tomorrow. We shook\
  \ hands and he slipped away into the darkness of the night.\n\nWhen I woke the next\
  \ morning, the group of police were gone. Out on deck the white heat of the sun\
  \ was blinding. Deckhands hosed down the animals and wrestled pigs to the front\
  \ of the boat. Soon we would be arriving at another settlement and there was work\
  \ to be done. Another day of life on the river."
