Text: "From a distance our car must stand out, a little lone white fish in a sea of\
  \ red.\n\nFor hundreds of kilometres we drive, watching the landscape monotonously\
  \ unfold before us, a flat, unyielding pan of stubble over the red dust of Australia\u2019\
  s Murray Darling Basin. The CD finished it\u2019s second round and I turn it off.\
  \ The strains of songs about the trials of love and religion, heartbreak and art\
  \ seeming so out of place in a landscape that is assumed to support the city lifestyle\
  \ represented in these songs.\n\nWe are hundreds of kilometres from any city, but\
  \ this land is fundamentally connected to that life of high rises, subway stations,\
  \ cafe culture, fashion and theatre. A slice of sourdough, made with wheat from\
  \ the fields stretching out around us, being now consumed somewhere within that\
  \ faraway hive of activity.\n\nWe see the wind pick up, not because the leaves in\
  \ the trees move, but because the earth rises from the ground, sometimes in a swirling\
  \ funnel, sometimes in small breaths, settling in the paddock next door or onto\
  \ the road\u2019s hot tar.\n\nWe drive and drive. The aircon blows onto our feet\
  \ and faces, cooling our bodies while the 40 degree celcius air outside beats, relentlessly,\
  \ against the glass panes.  After hours of seeing no one we see three men, a man\
  \ with his two sons, presumably. As though they\u2019ve stepped straight out of\
  \ an RM Williams ad, they are all wearing Akubras, checked shirts, one wears a vest,\
  \ jeans and boots. They are such a rare sign of life that we both can\u2019t help\
  \ staring as we zoom past. This little team have walked across their bare paddocks\
  \ and are cutting down some of the shrubs that stand along the fence line. They\
  \ are killing the only green and living things in this red dust landscape.\n\nWe\
  \ are both shocked, speechless, and look at each other and raise our eyebrows in\
  \ a knowing look.\n\u201CThat\u2019s fucked,\u201D Henry says after a brief minute.\n\
  \u201CYes\u2026.we\u2019ve fucked it.\u201D I replied, it\u2019s a code within which\
  \ is distilled all our many hours of debate and conversation. I am obviously referring\
  \ to humanity\u2019s impact on our environment.\nWe laughed, briefly, mirthlessly...what\
  \ else could we do?\n\nThirty minutes go under our tires, we put on another CD,\
  \ the only other one we\u2019ve brought with us. It cheers us up a little and the\
  \ scenery changes. We are driving through hills now, heading east and out of the\
  \ river flats, but the colours are still ochres and brown with wizened trees dotted,\
  \ sparsely, over the land.\n\nThe town of Rutherglen approaches us along the winding\
  \ country road that takes us there. The fibro shanties on the outskirts quickly\
  \ give way to the more permanent federation style houses with their arched verandahs\
  \ and ornate windows. Suddenly we find ourselves on the main strip. \n\nRutherglen\
  \ has successfully rebranded itself as a rural destination for the city folk from\
  \ Melbourne. The main street is as thriving as any country town could muster on\
  \ a Monday morning. Two men in cowboy boots and big hats are chatting with big grins,\
  \ slapping eachother on the arm before stalking past eachother. Shops with newly\
  \ painted signs sparkle as we slowly drive past, like tourists. The names sing out:\
  \ \u2018Busy Bees Quilts\u2019, \u2018The Oppe Shoppe\u2019, \u2018Riverpark Butcher\u2019\
  , \u2018The Merch\u2019. We pass them all.\n\nThere\u2019s a coffee shop at the\
  \ old train station, on the other side of town, which has been revamped into an\
  \ arts precinct. It\u2019s open and a convenient place to park, so we stop to stretch\
  \ our legs. The garden is planted with yellow roses, clipped to look like chupa\
  \ chups, purple pansies pop up in the mulch and lush fluro grass flanks its edge.\
  \ The perfect terracotta paving directs us toward the cafe door and we proceed past\
  \ the verdant pot plants to find a seat inside.\n\nWe order and sit silently, browsing\
  \ the souvenirs and incidental homewares before leaving, coffees in hand. Buckling\
  \ up we head out again toward the agricultural desert."
