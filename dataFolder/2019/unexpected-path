Text: my sister likes travelling a lot. once time she asked me to join her trip and
  her friend go to beach. the beach is not really famous among us. at that time i
  already finished my examinations so i agree to join my sister's trip. we need to
  drive around 2 hours from our house. the located of the beach beside my city. we
  leave our house in 9.00 a.m. so we arrived in the beach at 11.00 a.m. before i told
  about my vacation in beach i will explained little about the joourney. when we pass
  the city / region road that's okay because the road is good but when we pass the
  road through the jungle oh that's so amazing. but that's still okay for me because
  that's just twisting and enough for 2 vehicle. after that we've need to pass the
  macadam road. oh that's make me so afraid. my heart beating so fast. there's not
  just rocks but also mud. that's road can make anyone who pass that road slip. we've
  need to pass that road around 30 minutes. after that we can see the beach. oh that
  so hot there. the beach has beautiful scenery and clear water. there's also stone
  that we can sit there and see accross the sea. and also there's a mini river at
  the center of beach sand. but something missed from there is cleanness the environment
  also the accessibility to go there. i think that beach can be potential tourism
  object if government give attention on that. so, that's all my little story about
  my last trip. i want to go overseas so i submit this story and i want to share my
  experiences.
