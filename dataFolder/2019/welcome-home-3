Text: "I\u2019ve meant to visit Ireland for years, but felt it required more research\
  \ than just rental cars and maps, museums or average temperatures. \n\nMy maiden\
  \ name is Kelly, so it\u2019s almost certain I have family there. It\u2019s the\
  \ second most common surname in Ireland; some 50,000 out of a population of 4 million.\
  \ Kellys are descendants of the Gaelic clan the O\u2019Ceallaigh, which means \u2018\
  troublesome\u2019 or \u2018bright-haired\u2019.  They were so prominent in East\
  \ County Galway and South County Roscommon, that it was known as \u201CO\u2019Kellys\
  \ country\u201D.  During the Middle Ages, several Kellys served as bishops and one\
  \ was even named archbishop. They distinguished themselves on battle fields, in\
  \ politics, archaeology, and in sport. And many must have been part of the great\
  \ diaspora as a result of the famine of 1846-50, which would have been around the\
  \ time my Kellys appeared in the USA.\n\nOn my dad\u2019s side I can go back only\
  \ as far as his father, Franklin Bamford Kelly, who died in 1925 when my own dad\
  \ was only four years of age. What little I know is that he was a bright-haired\u2019\
  \ redhead, owned a millinery shop in Philadelphia, and served in the usher\u2019\
  s society of Bethlehem Presbyterian Church, clearly not a catholic.  He must have\
  \ been born in the late 1800\u2019s and could have been 1st or 2nd generation. I\
  \ realize all this information is available, and I\u2019ve meant to look into this\
  \ for years.\n\nWe traveled to Ireland in September because the airfares were irresistible.\
  \ For just over $200 roundtrip, we flew from Providence. R.I. to Cork and home from\
  \ Dublin on Norwegian Air Shuttle, an expanding low-cost carrier. While planning\
  \ the trip, we came across A Taste of West Cork Food Festival, which gave us a focus\
  \ on the first part of our journey.  The festival showcases local foods, growers,\
  \ and chefs, as well as the beauty of West Cork, with dramatic land and seascapes.\
  \ And yet, this area of the Emerald Isle suffered most during the famine. This could\
  \ be interesting.\n\nWe landed in Cork, a small airport and easy to maneuver, rented\
  \ a car and started the challenge of driving on the left. One picturesque village\
  \ followed another, the roads varied between narrow and narrower, but we arrived\
  \ safely in Skibbereen, a village about in the middle of the festival area, and\
  \ our home for three nights. We\u2019d not pre-booked any festival events, so with\
  \ program in hand, I went in search of an event for our first night. Some small\
  \ venues were already sold out, but I secured tickets for a locally sourced tasting\
  \ dinner at The Church, a restaurant located across from our B&B. When I bought\
  \ the last two tickets available, the proprietor asked if it was all right to seat\
  \ us with others. Of course, I responded, the better to meet people. We picked up\
  \ fancy cocktails and hors d\u2019oeuvres, like smoked salmon on Irish brown bread,\
  \ on the way to our table.  A former church and now a stunning restaurant, the place\
  \ had original stained-glass windows and crystal chandeliers, the choir loft now\
  \ with more tables overlooking the main floor, pews now benches; it just oozed with\
  \ atmosphere. The place was packed, about 100 in attendance, many seemed to know\
  \ each other.\n\nOur table mates were all from surrounding towns.  After introductions,\
  \ they asked if this was our first trip to Ireland. I responded \"Yes, indeed it\
  \ is. I\u2019ve  meant to visit sooner, after all, I\u2019m a Kelly.\"\n\nThe woman\
  \ across from me said \u201CWelcome Home.\u201D"
