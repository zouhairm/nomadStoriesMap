Text: "It was very sudden thought to go on some trip and quite excited too. It could\
  \ be the changing life trip .So all bags packed , things took in luggages and time\
  \ to boared . And it's car journey to that place an quite amazing and wonderful\
  \ wether it was .All was singing and eating and laughing , that was quite wonderful\
  \ and cheerful time . \nI Never imagined that this is going to be happen . I meet\
  \ someone and it was a shop .A  small kid who even didn't had good cloths to wear\
  \ . He told me \" what you want \" I said some chips  and also the wether was so\
  \ raniy and cold so we just took a little break there  and it was quite beautiful\
  \ there . The wether was becaming so bad and it was very dangerous to drive . We\
  \ thought that we were going to trip and now what will happen . Then that small\
  \ child and his dad who was sitting in room there told that , stay here if u want\
  \ , it's small home but u can stay till the weather become normal . We all stayed\
  \ there and all was sad  that we couldn't go on trip . But that was the most beautiful\
  \ trip ever , the things which we saw there , the life of that small kid who used\
  \ to wake up early in morning when we even didn't dream of, and preparing tea and\
  \ snacks for the people , is something that touched inside of us . \nThat we all\
  \ go here and there for traveling and but there are lots of people who can't even\
  \ think to have small free time for themselves . We learnt so many things and that\
  \ is why that trip was really speacil."
