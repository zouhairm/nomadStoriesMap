Text: "I was standing at the eastern end of the country, admiring the sacred island\
  \ that locals call the eye of the crocodile, the eye of their ancestor. Two decades\
  \ ago, during Indonesian invasion, the locals would face death penalty, if they\
  \ entered the island.\n\nEast Timor is the newest country in Asia. It is also one\
  \ of the least visited countries in the world. The security situation remains an\
  \ obstacle. When I visited the country in August 2018, it was just two years after\
  \ the government considered it is safe for people to be outside at night.\n\nBut,\
  \ I had a mission to set foot on Jaco Island, located at the tip of the country,\
  \ simply because I couldn't find any Indonesian blog or vlog covering the island.\
  \ Challenge accepted!\n\nOnline, Jaco Island is an off-the-beaten-path tropical\
  \ paradise with one of the most beautiful beaches in the world. But I soon realised\
  \ why people do not go there --it is almost impossible to reach.\n\nAfter 27 years\
  \ of Indonesian occupation, East Timor was left with almost 90% of its infrastructure\
  \ destroyed. Public bus systems barely exist, internet quality sucks, information\
  \ online is limited, it's hard to getting around, there is no price and quality\
  \ standard for lodging, and poor road quality makes driving in East Timor dangerous.\
  \ You need to master the art of waiting and being okay with the unknown to travel\
  \ in this country. It takes a long time to move from one place to another. Also,\
  \ the currency is in USD, making it the most expensive country for travelling in\
  \ Southeast Asia --after Singapore.\n\nAll of those challenges make East Timor a\
  \ perfect destination for an adventurer. It is like an oasis in the world of you-can-find-anything-in-Google.\n\
  \nI arrived in Dili, East Timor on Saturday night after taking 12-hour day bus from\
  \ Kupang, Indonesia. People in Kupang and East Timor come from the same descendant,\
  \ they are called Timorese. I thought their personality and culture would be the\
  \ same. I was curious why they were split into two countries. Oh boy, they are totally\
  \ different. I experienced a kind of hospitality that hits home in Kupang, people\
  \ are warm and treat me like family. But, Dili has a Latin town vibe with gang-related\
  \ violence and bloodshed, like what I watched in the movie. I could almost smell\
  \ the blood in the air. \n\nI decided to get a host from Couchsurfing, because it\
  \ is the cheapest and most feasible way to get to Jaco. That was my first time using\
  \ the app. I did not have any idea what to expect. I would be accompanied by a stranger\
  \ in a country with a fragile security condition. Should I worry?\n\nI spent the\
  \ first three days in Dili, following my host wherever he went. He was being overprotective\
  \ by not letting me go out by myself. I had no option but to wait patiently for\
  \ the time to depart to Jaco. J and his friends kept delaying and changing the plan.\
  \ I was frustrated.\n\nEventually, on Wednesday 2 am, we left Dili and started the\
  \ journey to the east. We were going fancy with 4WD and a driver. I was elated,\
  \ this is way better than my expectation. We made a quick stop in Lospalos to pick\
  \ up their friend who is a local and had breakfast. It's the last city before Valu\
  \ beach which placed in the end of Timor island.\n\nThe road from Dili to Lospalos\
  \ is hazardous, hardly paved with many hollows. Yet, nothing compares to the road\
  \ connected Lospalos to Valu. It's not a road, it's a rugged train that coincidentally\
  \ not overgrown by trees. We were so darnn lucky no rain came, the path would be\
  \ impassable.\n\nThe moment after two hours hustling the trail was history as we\
  \ entered Valu beach. A short trip with fisherman boat would make it to Jaco Island.\
  \ I conquered the challenge! The view was beyond any word or picture could ever\
  \ describe. Crystal clear blue turquoise water, untouched reef, spectacular landscape,\
  \ highly diverse flora and fauna, no tourists, and no single plastic trash. It is\
  \ absolutely worth the endeavour!"
