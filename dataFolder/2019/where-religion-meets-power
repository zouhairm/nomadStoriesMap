Text: "Mount Athos. Technically Greece, actually an independent country ruled by christian\
  \ orthodox monks. Women can't pose foot on the peninsula, and a complex system of\
  \ Diamatronition (a kind of visa) and reservations in monasteries is needed to enter.\
  \ The only way to access the peninsula is a ferry-boat from Ouranopolis, the last\
  \ \"greek\" city, to Dafne. A village the local call the main seaport, while actually\
  \ is a wharf in the middle of the sea. There are no tourists in Mounth Athos, just\
  \ pilgrims.\nI had to sleep in monastery, being discriminated for being raised as\
  \ a catholic. Growing up in Italy it was the first time in my life. Some monks refused\
  \ to have contact with anyone from other religions.\nMoving across monasteries,\
  \ the local language changes, according to the patriarchate the monastery belongs\
  \ to. Not speaking Greek, nor Russian, nor Serbian, it was not such a big deal for\
  \ me. English is still a rarity on the island. Spectaculars \"sketes\", rooms facing\
  \ on the sea in the middle of nowhere where a single monk live a life of segregations,\
  \ are all over. If you are lucky you can still see some monks bringing food to them,\
  \ once per month.\nA greek post office in the capital city lets to ship letters\
  \ and postcards. It's amazing cheap, but four months later, I'm still waiting mine.\n\
  When in Mounth Athos you live with the rhythms of the monks. You eat with them (once\
  \ per day, around 4 pm), there are no shops or restaurants (in the \"capital city\"\
  , Kayres, there are two emporium, indeed) and feel asleep early without distraction\
  \ (and with not much electric power). The monks start the day around 2, with the\
  \ first mass of the day. During these masses they often worship relics, of which\
  \ Mount Athos is full. I watch the biggest piece of the cross on which Jesus died\
  \ (or at least they told me so). They still use the Julian calendar, and have their\
  \ own time system (they count the hours from the first mass, not after midnight\
  \ as pretty much the rest of the world).\nWhat did I learn from Mount Athos? An\
  \ old proverb says that when in pilgrimage, you need to do three things. You need\
  \ to leave something behind, you need to bring something from there, and you need\
  \ to embrace something new for the rest of your life. I left an old love there,\
  \ I learn a lot about orthodox habits, and I brought with me what it means to live\
  \ without TV, radio and internet in 2019. A country without factories, ADSL, technology,\
  \ that still lives pretty much as during Dark Ages. \n\nThank you Mouth Athos!"
