Text: "When I decided to visit my fourth African country (Togo) by road, I knew that\
  \ it was going to be adventurous; Togo is a francophone country that uses a different\
  \ currency (CFA) that I am not familiar with, has a culture (Food, clothing, music,\
  \ etc.) that I have not experienced, and has great ancestral histories. Before embarking\
  \ on this two-day escapade journey from Lagos, Nigeria to Lom\xE9, Togo, I have\
  \ already filled my mind and thought with lots of imagination about Togo and the\
  \ people of Togo.\n\nThe journey which start from Mazamaza in Lagos, Nigeria had\
  \ a double-decker bus filled with travelers from all walks of life; Students, fellow\
  \ tourist, diplomats, business men and women, etc. Majority have had their neck\
  \ pillows on and ready to sleep, while few others and I, who are on this trip for\
  \ the first time have fastened our seat belts ready to explore with our eyes, mouth,\
  \ and nose. We have not traveled far from Nigeria\u2019s border, when I started\
  \ to realize how nature have shaded her beauty with sea sands and Coconut trees\
  \ along the cost of Benin Republic. On getting to Cotonou which is the largest city\
  \ in Benin Republic I was quick to notice that they use motorcycle as a means of\
  \ transport, just like we do in Nigeria. Driving through the city, it occurred to\
  \ me that it is not having enough magnificent edifies like Nigeria\u2019s largest\
  \ city Lagos but there were things that caught my attention which I did not hesitate\
  \ to take picture of using my camera. The journey continued till we got to Porto-Novo\
  \ where we had our first stop over; It was an evening in that port city and the\
  \ weather was calm, full of stars and soft sea breeze. From my hotel room, I could\
  \ see the see port. Even though I could not see the ships because it was late, I\
  \ could see their lights and its reflection on the ocean. Seeing the lights from\
  \ the ships, cranes, and buildings close to the ocean and their reflection on the\
  \ water plus the stars in the heavens, was a vision of ecstasy. I almost stayed\
  \ up all night under the mild and friendly weather looking at the port. Our journey\
  \ to Togo continued the following day with us making our second stop at Lakonji;\
  \ The border between Togo and Benin Republic. A protocol in Lakonji requires that\
  \ all passengers will have to come down from the bus and walk through certain check\
  \ points while drivers also drive to certain check point meant for cars. On walking\
  \ to the other end part of the border which is Togo, I saw a lot just within that\
  \ circumference. There were black market money changers who were struggling with\
  \ communicating in English. They taught me how to determine the value of my currency\
  \ (Naira) against theirs using Dollar. In that same spot, I tried some Togolese\
  \ food like akume (made of corn), and zugbo (I can\u2019t say what it was made of).\
  \ The people there at the border were very friendly, they calmed my nerves and made\
  \ me to feel welcomed. Just right there at the border, I also learned some basic\
  \ languages like \u201CMerci\u201D, \u201CBonjour\u201D, \u201CBonsoir\u201D, \u201C\
  Bon mache\u201D and few numbers in French. When our driver came over, we all boarded\
  \ back and this time around, we went straight to my final destination Lom\xE9, Togo.\n\
  \nMy assumptions of the my road trip to Togo was adventurous  and indeed it was.\
  \ I thought that it was going to be a negative experience considering all the thing\
  \ that I was going to struggle with, but it ended up being positive and worthwhile."
