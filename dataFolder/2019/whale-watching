Text: "I didn\u2019t want to go. Our journey begins at the border of USA and Mexico,\
  \ traveling south in a packed van far from our familiar reaches of travel. My father\
  \ decided to take us whale watching three years ago. I didn\u2019t want to leave\
  \ the security of my home. Of the then seven kids, I must have disliked it the most.\
  \             Most of B.C. is a long, lonely desert no one inhabits except for a\
  \ tiny gasoline town. It was a warm weekend in early February. The date and time\
  \ is easy to remember because it was Super bowl Sunday when we arrived at Santa\
  \ Rosalia, a mining town. I fell in love with the strange town of brightly painted\
  \ houses set on a canvas of lush mountainside.                                 \
  \                    A French company bought it in 1885 for its copper mines. It\
  \ is known for its quaint wooden houses and an old church. The architect Gustave\
  \ Eiffel is said to have designed the church, the parts shipped on boats. My mother\
  \ told us all this as we sat waiting in the car.                               \
  \                    We continued our trip south, arriving at magical oasis town\
  \ of Mulege. Set at the mouth of Rio de Sta. Rosal\xEDa, it winds back into the\
  \ country in a jungle of palm trees below the hills. It is like getting to heaven\
  \ without knowing it. My parents had been here on their honeymoon about twenty years\
  \ ago. The hotel we stayed at was the same one my grandfather and dad stayed at\
  \ when they went on vacation. Because so much is hillside, the parking lot is on\
  \ one slanting side with the hotel across the street. It\u2019s red and white, with\
  \ some American\u2019s cars in the few spots in front of the hotel. We walk past\
  \ the gate and dead leaves into a small room with an adjoining bathroom. My sister\
  \ found black sharpie signatures on a cardboard behind the mirror. They belong mostly\
  \ to Australians and other wild minded individuals. We watched the rest of the game\
  \ at the restaurant. It was cloudy the next morning that we drove to see the mission.\
  \ It is built on a hill overlooking the main area of the oasis with the most spectacular\
  \ views for miles around. It gives a strange feeling to be out there with no one\
  \ but vultures and crows to keep you company. You are allowed to go inside the mission,\
  \ with its dark old pews and creepy figures set along the stone walls.       I was\
  \ sad to leave Mulege as we trudged 135 kilometers south to Loreto. An oblivion\
  \ of a desert, I immediately hated it. Too rough to be enchanting and I wondered\
  \ how people could live in places like this... but they probably had no choice.\
  \ I had a choice however, to be happy or sad about it and I could have liked it\
  \ if I would open my eyes.       Along the way I had begun counting crosses. The\
  \ crosses that adorn the edges of winding roads. Likely more common on roads in\
  \ M\xE9xico than in countries like the U.S. It speaks  to the dangers every traveler\
  \ faces when he journeys into unknown territory. I counted between fifty five to\
  \ eighty before I lost count. Some were white, some alone, either metal or wooden\
  \ on empty roads.            We saw the whales .A couple on the boat with us said\
  \ they hadn\u2019t been able to get a good glimpse of the whales. We were their\
  \ \u201Cgood luck\u201D, she said. A huge curtain of morning fog blocked out the\
  \ heavy sun and sat over the ocean. Their barnacle covered bodies slid under the\
  \ boat as we reached to touch them. For a moment the trip was forever worth its\
  \ ordeal.                                        The resilience and lively attitude\
  \ are impressive in a country filled with so much uncertainty, but most of all,\
  \ cactus. Perhaps it is their closeness with nature that teaches them to live this\
  \ way."
