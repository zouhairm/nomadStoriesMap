Text: '"If you are looking for the ''native'' Indians, go to Tamil Nadu"


  A south Indian state, Tamil Nadu is surrounded by the Bay of Bengal on East and
  Indian Ocean on the south. It is said that the south Indians are the natives of
  Indian land and the ones in North India are actually the races which migrated hundreds
  of years ago and hence the quote at the top!


  Needless, to say, a beautiful state, here are a few of the many places to visit
  on your trip to Tamil Nadu.


  1) Chennai (Formerly Madras)


  The capital city of the state of Tamil Nadu, Chennai is one of the Indian metro
  city. A hub of the cultural, social, commercial, industrial and the economic development,
  the city is famous for its amazing culture and the heritage. Chennai is home to
  more than 20 structures which can be considered as a part of the South Indian heritage.
  These structures include different museums, cinema halls and even the bookshops
  (cheer up if you are an avid reader). Known in the world for the clean beaches,
  parks and temples, Chennai is also an attraction among the tourists for the shopping
  of south Indian handicraft and clothes (especially sarees.)

  2) Mahabalipuram

  Ruled by the Pallava dynasty in 7th century AD, the city of Mahabalipuram is an
  ancient Indian town. Having brilliant monuments which are carved out of Granite
  and are a live example of the Dravidian architecture, Mahabalipuram has UNESCO classified
  world heritage sites. It is a must visit for the temples and monuments for the story
  behind every wall of these will mesmerise you!'
