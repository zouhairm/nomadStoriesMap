Text: "It was the first sunny day after storm in Rome. The city was just waking up,\
  \ streets were strewn with tree leaves and broken umbrellas that were thrown out\
  \ by people. My new friend Fabio invited me to have breakfast in a magnificent park\
  \ Appia Antica. A perfect quiet place to listen birds singing while first sunlights\
  \ were kissing my face. I was telling Fabio that I\u2019d like to explore new district\
  \ and after delicious chocolate cornetto with cappuccino he took me to Garbatella\
  \ by his old stylish Vespa. He dropped me off near public park and left for work.\
  \ There was no one around and that was the time when magic began. \n\nI was staying\
  \ in the middle of the park and checking directions with my online map. Suddenly\
  \ a flock of birds appeared above my head and I heard their screams. Hundreds of\
  \ seagulls were flying round and round over the trees, rising up to the blue sky.\
  \ I took my eyes off my phone and saw a homeless woman with three huge bags of food.\
  \ She was preparing some bread to feed these birds and they knew it. She started\
  \ to give them bread crumbs little by little to make sure that everyone would get\
  \ a piece. I made few steps back and I began to watch as enchanted. \n\nIn the same\
  \ conditions those birds were behaving differently. The leaders were gorgeously\
  \ catching flying pieces in the movement while others were fighting on the ground\
  \ to get some leftovers. There was one more type - they were just sitting on the\
  \ same place and waiting when they got something to eat without making any efforts.\
  \ Those birds reminded me humans. \n\nA homeless woman saw me and smiled. Her smile\
  \ was so warm and sincere, she had some special light in her eyes. She was glowing\
  \ with happiness. I couldn\u2019t wait anymore - I came to her to express my gratefulness\
  \ for this breathtaking moments. She seemed so shy and pleased at the same time.\
  \ She wanted to tell me her story but, unfortunately, I couldn\u2019t understand\
  \ Italian. I found some coins in my pocket, gave to her and asked to buy a good\
  \ breakfast in gratitude from me. \n\nAt that moment I realized how wonderful is\
  \ sometimes to take eyes off the phone screen and just look around, observe, notice\
  \ details and feel the present. This homeless woman reminded me that we should always\
  \ keep our eyes open.  \n\nI wished her a beautiful day and continued walking with\
  \ a wide smile on my face and goosebumps on my skin."
