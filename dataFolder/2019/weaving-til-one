Text: "As we inch our doors closed and tighten our borders as a nation, it\u2019s\
  \ mind-boggling that the doors to the rest of the world still remain so open to\
  \ us. I felt more at home and welcome in Ecuador, a country that was not mine, than\
  \ the one where I have lived all my life. It isn\u2019t hard to walk the streets\
  \ of New York and have no one\u2015not a single person\u2015look at you, but somehow\
  \ it is not uncommon to be welcomed into the lives and traditions of those you have\
  \ only just met in a country where you are a foreigner.\n\nPerhaps the best spur\
  \ of the moment decision I made while backpacking, was my visit to the Panama hat\
  \ museum. The cobblestone streets that led to the museum were warmed under my feet\
  \ by the morning sun. I arrived at the museum to find a small, open, unroofed gravel\
  \ courtyard in the middle and surrounding it were open rooms with displays of the\
  \ hats, processes, and materials. The security guard chatted idly as took me through\
  \ the first two rooms. Then I saw three people setting up and beginning to weave\
  \ along the edge of the courtyard. Each was sitting on his/her own stool in the\
  \ open air, shielded from the sun by the outcropping roof. This is where I stopped\
  \ awkwardly standing for a moment. This was the main reason I had made the journey\
  \ that morning. I asked to stay and watch, and they pulled a stool over for me and\
  \ one of the women pulled hers close to mine and began to show me what she was doing.\
  \ Soon she handed it off to me and said \u201Cahora intenta,\u201D meaning now you\
  \ try. The process looked so quick and fluid when she did it, but I was sure I would\
  \ mess it up. I politely declined, saying I\u2019d just like to watch, but this\
  \ seemed to be an unacceptable answer as she asked again. Not wanting to be rude,\
  \ I accepted, and she began to teach me. I wasn\u2019t sure what I was making until\
  \ I noticed the gentleman sitting across from me weaving in the same manner, and\
  \ he explained that it would turn into a snowman, as the holidays were right around\
  \ the corner. \n\nThe time flew by I sat for hours weaving alongside them, chatting\
  \ as best I could with my pieced together broken Spanish. A few others came and\
  \ went, some staying to weave, others just to chat for a bit. It seemed that the\
  \ tradition was something that attracted everyone, young and old, men and women\
  \ alike. My departure time had been determined before I\u2019d even sat down, with\
  \ my bus ticket purchased, and friends waiting for me at my next destination, I\
  \ begrudgingly said a bittersweet goodbye as they ask if I\u2019d be joining them\
  \ again on Saturday.\n\nThe third and final room remained a mystery to me as I never\
  \ made it past the people weaving. In the time I spent there, there was only one\
  \ other group of people that came to check out the museum, a couple who sauntered\
  \ through at a jaunty pace pausing only slightly to look at those of us weaving\
  \ and then moving right along to that third room adjacent to us and then back out\
  \ the door from which they came, seemingly content with their experience and ready\
  \ to move on to whatever was next. You never really know what you\u2019re going\
  \ to walk into or the type of experience that awaits you when you\u2019re traveling.\
  \ I had expected somewhat of a human zoo, to have a manufactured, perfectly tailored,\
  \ tourist \u201Cexperience\u201D, but what I got was so real and raw. So many of\
  \ the cultural experiences we pay for when we travel, though based on true culture,\
  \ often times come off a bit choreographed, like a fa\xE7ade. However, this unplanned\
  \ experience was mutual by nature, as I glimpsed into their lives I felt a part\
  \ of it, not a spectator, if for only a brief moment. Had I simply chosen a different\
  \ day to visit they very well might not have been there at all."
