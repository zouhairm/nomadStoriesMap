Text: "\u201CHave you never done cardio before?\u201D the instructor asked. People\
  \ around us sniggered.\n    My face burned even redder than it already was as my\
  \ friends and I trudged behind the group along the side of the mountain.\n    \u201C\
  Not in thirty-five degree heat,\u201D I wanted to spit back at him. \n    My friends\
  \ and I bitched about the instructor\u2019s embarrassing remark during the rest\
  \ of the climb. \n    We were in Omis, Croatia, where there are mountains, rivers\
  \ and the sea all within a one mile radius. No matter where we turned, there was\
  \ a completely strange and new view to be seen. There was a quiet sea side in one\
  \ direction, a river that reflected the sun in another, and surreal grey mountains\
  \ that stood out as if they had been photoshopped everywhere else.\n    Heights\
  \ was not my thing, which I had learned while walking along the wall around Old\
  \ Dubrovnik Town. I had quivered at the knees at every ascent of the narrow wall,\
  \ freezing still whenever someone nipped past me. But, then again, heights are worth\
  \ it. I saw a part of the world that I\u2019d never seen before, in a moment that\
  \ I could never relive exactly as it was. I saw the sky meet the sea as though the\
  \ sky could be beneath me. I saw clumps of islands where the trees and bushes buzzed\
  \ with vibrant greens.\n    Which is what led me to here.\n    I was the last person\
  \ in the queue, gracefully allowing my friends to go ahead of me. The harness was\
  \ drastically uncomfortable and I desperately needed to adjust my knickers but I\
  \ was too terrified to move anything in case that would be the cause for my imminent\
  \ death. I\u2019d rather live with a wedgie than plummet to my scenic end.\n   \
  \ I watched as people disappeared, one after another. They became part of the wilderness\
  \ as they landed as ant-sized idiots on the other side. \n    But it was the cheers.\
  \ Can I even describe them as cheers? They all screamed out, one after the other,\
  \ as if everything they had ever felt before was coming out in one noise. As if\
  \ they couldn\u2019t help themselves. \n    What happened after that first jump?\
  \ What feeling was it? \n    Those noises were one of two reasons why I didn\u2019\
  t turn around.\n    The second reason was the incredulity of watching people stand\
  \ on my level in one minute, and then become part of the sky in the next. They trailed\
  \ along the treetops and they blended in with the rivers beneath. There were tiny\
  \ people getting out of their tiny cars down on earth to watch.\n    \u201CLast\
  \ but not least,\u201D the instructor said when everyone had vanished to the other\
  \ side and it was only me left on this side. The fearful side versus the invincible\
  \ one. \n    I wanted to still be mad at him for his comment earlier, but my head\
  \ and heart thumped in unison as I stepped onto the wooden platform. \n    \u201C\
  Oh god, oh god, oh god,\u201D I whispered to myself. \n    \u201CTake your time.\
  \ Don\u2019t worry. No matter what happens, we are here to help. Nothing can go\
  \ wrong.\u201D I nodded at him, grateful that he was recognising my terror.\n  \
  \  And I jumped.\n    While I was moving at what felt like the speed of light, I\
  \ saw everything. I saw a shade of river that I hadn\u2019t seen that morning. I\
  \ could see the smiles, fist pumps and waves of my friends on the other side. I\
  \ could see the dot of a man who stood beside his car on the road beneath me, the\
  \ awed expression of his face. I could see the colours dancing together.\n    And\
  \ I could see that there was nothing between me and the sky.\n    I opened my mouth\
  \ and I screamed."
