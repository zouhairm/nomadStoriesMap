Text: "I shed away my tears in my 4 square meter rent room, away from my family and\
  \ loved ones. I knew it. Everything about life I have before will be different.\
  \ I am embracing new mindset as a woman through this experience.\n\nI packed my\
  \ belonging into a medium black suitcase and a big backpack, ready to embark on\
  \ a journey. It was my first time abroad, and it is going to be a long one. I never\
  \ thought that Castellon de la Plana will be a first city I ever visited. A small\
  \ delightful town in the southern part of Spain. I got accepted to join an exchange\
  \ program for a semester, which is 5 months more or less. Long flight and wrong\
  \ train took me hours to arrive in Castellon. A fresh and distinct air welcomed\
  \ me into this city. \n\nI was in the middle of confusion and fear at that time.\
  \ I was on my master degree and a long-time relationship. I was not ready for everything,\
  \ I just want to run away from it. He never knew I felt that way. While I am trying\
  \ to adjusting life, an unexpected news came from a short message on social media,\
  \ and unfortunately internet on my flat was down at that time. I run to the nearest\
  \ bike station, jumped right away, paddled my bike as hard as I could. I tried so\
  \ hard to be on the university to get internet connection. He told me that my husky,\
  \ Ang, he was disappeared. Not only that, my Pitbull was sick as hell. I cried like\
  \ I didn't care if anyone saw me like that. \n\nThat moment changes a lot of things.\
  \ I believe that there are things that beyond my control and I have to accept and\
  \ let go. I was blaming myself for what happen to my dog and he was blaming me for\
  \ not being there. It was a wreck. I was devastated. But, life must go on. I went\
  \ on with my amazing experience in Castellon and Spain. All the people I met, all\
  \ the places I have been, opened my eyes about being alive and enjoying every moment\
  \ of it. \n\nI am married with him now but it will be different story if I was not\
  \ going to Castellon. I know what I want now and believe I can make myself happy\
  \ with or without him. I am pleased that I have a moment in my life where I travel\
  \ away just to find me, my own self, that independent and strong young woman. Castellon\
  \ changed that ugly caterpillar into a butterfly. Butterfly who knows it's worth\
  \ and confidence to fly.\n\nNo one can blame me for things I never done. The sunshine\
  \ and the strong wind of Castellon change the way I see myself as a woman."
