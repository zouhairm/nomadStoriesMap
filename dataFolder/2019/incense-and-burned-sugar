Text: "I think it\u2019s probably fair to say that the pyramids look tall whether\
  \ you are five foot nothing or 6\u20193. But to my ten-year-old tiny self, to the\
  \ girl with the unfortunate middle parting and the strangely long denim shorts,\
  \ they were more than tall- gargantuan, vast and awesome, (in the old sense of the\
  \ word); solid weights of history that stretched to the skies on their tiptoes.\
  \ Being there, seeing them- it made the six hour plane journey, the gridlock, the\
  \ street vendor that told my mother she should bring us to his papyrus shop because\
  \ \u2018the pyramids are closed today\u2019, the queuing and the ticket price- all\
  \ worth it in less than a second, in the space between an inhale and an exhale.\
  \ Looking back now, I wonder if they are anything like tents- if, were they to be\
  \ moved, they would leave a paler patch of desert underneath, a scoring in the sand\
  \ to remember where exactly they had stood. I don\u2019t know who I think might\
  \ move them, or how, or what sort of a winch system they would have to use. But\
  \ it isn\u2019t what struck me about Cairo, or why I would go back.\nI don\u2019\
  t know whether it was the business of a tourist trap, or just the fact that I had\
  \ seen their image hundreds of times before, on postcards and documentaries so that\
  \ I knew at least in theory what to expect (not to say this meant that when I actually\
  \ was presented with them this lessened their impact- see above\u2026) but it did\
  \ mean that the pyramids aren\u2019t what keeps Cairo alive in my mind eight years\
  \ later. They were the expected. \nAmazingly, it wasn\u2019t the camel ride (great\
  \ fun, but ethically highly dubious in retrospect) or the trip to look at whale\
  \ bones (-whale bones! In the middle of the Egyptian desert!) though the joltiness\
  \ of rolling over hills in a scarcely-cushioned, metal-benched jeep with no suspensions\
  \ and too few seat-belts may have had something to do with this. It wasn\u2019t\
  \ even sitting on the thin streak of balcony dangling from the walls of the flat\
  \ of the family friend we had come to visit, in the aftermath of the abrupt Egyptian\
  \ sunset, drinking filtered water from heavy, opaque glasses and watching the traffic\
  \ below while my brother, 13 then, made my sister laugh by squishing my cheeks in\
  \ what he called (and still calls): \u2018fish face\u2019. Nope, none of that quite\
  \ made the cut. Neither did the oasis we drove out to in just a couple of hours,\
  \ where we took rare and rudimentary showers (a luxury, I have since learned, in\
  \ comparison to the sand-showers our Egyptian friend took while he was travelling,\
  \ but no luxury compared to the gritty glitz that Cairo had welcomes us with so\
  \ far), where we went to a pottery shop and picked out singular terra-cotta tiles\
  \ with original and ornate designs.\n\nNo, it was none of this. It was the markets.\
  \ \n\nRemembering, the markets of Cairo smell like incense and burned sugar, but\
  \ I am sure that this is an enormously rose-tinted adaptation of the mixing, lingering\
  \ smells of meat and leather, of vegetables on the verge of decay (in the late afternoon,\
  \ once all the fresh ones had been bought up and carted off back to homes across\
  \ the city), and the smells of different people\u2019s perfumes and sweat from the\
  \ crowd gathered between the stalls. Later, when I asked why we were so stared at,\
  \ our friend told me that a girl in the middle of the market not wearing a headscarf\
  \ was like a girl in a London street wearing a bikini, or no shoes. I didn\u2019\
  t mind. There, the market-stall owners hiss at you to get you out of the way as\
  \ they push wheelbarrows of stock through the narrow corridors of space between\
  \ market-dwellers, which was strange but funny. The point is, I would go back to\
  \ Cairo for the markets. Scents glamorised by memory or not, nowhere in the markets\
  \ in London, not even Brick Lane, or anywhere else I\u2019ve ever been for that\
  \ matter, have I felt the vibrations of life thrum so loudly."
