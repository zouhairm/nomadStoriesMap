Text: "I had the chance to witness the beauty of my country in an island called West\
  \ Nusa Tenggara with my mother and her co-workers. I should not have any expectation\
  \ about that journey, but I couldn't help it. I didn't expect to find such disappointment\
  \ traveling with elder people. They couldn't walk far, they were not interested\
  \ in the view, but so much for shopping pearls.  But I told myself that  came there\
  \ to have fun, to see beautiful places, so I did change my mind. \n\nMy story will\
  \ not be able to stand up against those amazing stories, I am not being sad or pessimistic\
  \ but I am just saying the truth. But I snorkeled for the first time, how I realized\
  \ that what we see in the outside, what I saw on TV about snorkeling was completely\
  \ wrong. I never thought that trying to breath like that takes time and when I finally\
  \ could do it better, I had to stop, I had to go.  It was terrifying and mesmerizing\
  \ at the same time. I am kid who never went out to see the world. My escape for\
  \ outside world was a TV and beautiful pictures on my calendar that drove me to\
  \ go to see those places. I didn't expect to find such an intimate and amazing moment\
  \ when the guide held my hand and guided me through the journey in the sea. How\
  \ I never thought that I would trust the guide whose name is still a mystery to\
  \ me but I still can remember his voice until now. \n\nThat trip also let me see\
  \ those foreigners who looked at me strangely because I wore long pants and long\
  \ sleeve shirt while swimming and I smiled at them anyway. I learned a lot about\
  \ myself and my mom in that trip. I learned that I sea scares and attracts me. I\
  \ learned that the people I traveled with not just some old people who need to get\
  \ away from work or showing off, but they are people. People who get scared of jumping\
  \ off the boat because they remembered their childhood, people who jumped because\
  \ they wanted to beat their trauma for accidentally fell off the boat when they\
  \ were younger or people like mom, who spent most of her childhood and found herself\
  \ scared of the water now that she is older, and she was up there, worried about\
  \ me, or people like me who found herself still being a kid and realized that I\
  \ am actually clueless and curious.\n\nOne of the best moment was in the bus. We\
  \ went back to town after snorkeling, and I saw this beach which had a high fence,\
  \ with grass, palm trees and some local people sat there. It was like a secret beach.\
  \ I promised myself to go back there. I promise."
