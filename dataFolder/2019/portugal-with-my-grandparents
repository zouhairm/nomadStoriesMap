Text: "Portugal was an astounding experience. I can say my travel was a journey of\
  \ a lifetime. My grandparents made this trip memorable; this is the first voyage\
  \ outside of the U.S. that I have traveled with both of them. Throughout the excursion,\
  \ I had to watch over my grandparents with my mother, my great aunt, and great uncle.\
  \ There were times that they drove me crazy, but I would not have changed it for\
  \ anything. They are babies, but much older and wiser. I have made wonderful memories\
  \ with them. \n\nSome of those memories included taking selfies with my grandparents\
  \ and great aunt and uncle, my grandpa taking pictures of my grandma with his camera\
  \ and joking around with my great aunt and uncle, during the guided tours. They\
  \ had wonderful stories to tell during our car ride to different cities. The stories\
  \ that they would describe would be about their childhood memories in Colombia.\
  \ Other stories that occurred during the trip were the admission prices for senior\
  \ citizens. Since my grandparents were above eighty, they were free. My great uncle\
  \ asked in the next museum; \u201Cso all of us that are eighty could go in for free\u201D\
  \ knowing well, that he is only seventy-five. It turned out that in this museum;\
  \ all seniors pay the same price. It was funny that he was increasing his age to\
  \ go in for free. It was hilarious that he was raising his age to go in for free.\
  \ \n\nAll of the \"kids\"; an endearing name for my grandparents and great aunt\
  \ and uncle, throughout the trip, made us laugh like no tomorrow.  Every time that\
  \ I walked around the area, they disappeared. They would either be taking pictures\
  \ of everyone and everything or shopping for more souvenirs. However, even though\
  \ they acted like babies at times, there was a positive side to this. My family\
  \ and I got lucky that our taxi driver in Portugal did guide tours around Lisbon.\
  \ We used his taxi car to travel to the different historical sites of the town.\
  \ It also made me realize that I want to be like them when I get older. I want to\
  \ be in my late seventies or early eighties and still explore the world and travel\
  \ with my grandchildren.\n\nGrowing up, I always thought history was boring. History\
  \ was my least favorite subject in school. I always dreaded going to class. As I\
  \ began to travel and began to experience history, I started to have an appreciation\
  \ for the culture and history of many different places. The place that changed my\
  \ view in history was the palace in Sintra. It is a village on a mountain, covered\
  \ by forests Sintra is the capital of the nostalgia and romance of the past. Every\
  \ design and detail in the castle; told a story and it gave me the desire to be\
  \ a part of that story. I felt like I was in a fairytale. \n\nThe architecture in\
  \ Portugal was aesthetically beautiful and had me in awe. Many of the buildings\
  \ that I saw in Portugal; were churches and they were magnificent. With the technology\
  \ in that era, the buildings were fascinating to experience at the moment. It amazes\
  \ me how all of the architects built these buildings with very little to no technology.\
  \ The structure and design of the buildings were hand-made. Some of the places that\
  \ I visited took many years to construct. Those places were Jer\xF3nimos Monastery,\
  \ S\xE3o Jorge Castle, Belem Tower, Pena Palace, and Pra\xE7a do Com\xE9rcio. The\
  \ architects had such creativity to build these treasures. \n\nThe majority of these\
  \ treasures were made of stone and had vivid colors to represent a symbol of royalty\
  \ or religious. The monuments in Portugal had Romanesque and Gothic influences in\
  \ its architecture. There was a variety of styles such as; manuelin and baroque.\
  \ In one of the cathedrals, the interior was made entirely of wood. It amazed me\
  \ that the architects created this beauty. Overall, the food was exquisite, the\
  \ culture was divine, and the people were welcoming. The visit to Portugal is an\
  \ excursion that I will cherish for life. I hope to make my way back to Portugal\
  \ soon."
