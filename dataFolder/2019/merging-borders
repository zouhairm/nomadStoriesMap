Text: "While me and my friend are across the border in Nepal, my gaze fell on the\
  \ numerous shops at Lakeside city in Pokhara that displayed red & blue hanging signs\
  \ \u2013 \u201C100% Pure Pashmina\u201D and \u201COriginal Cashmere\u201D. A pashmina\
  \ or cashmere sweater would make for a good gift for my father, who is turning 65\
  \ soon. Both him and my mother are busy packing suitcases two months in advance\
  \ for their first trip abroad.\n\nWith no data plan in our phones, we sought for\
  \ the very shopkeepers who sold them to help us know the difference (or lack thereof)\
  \ between a pashmina and cashmere. Hopping in and out of plenty such shops, we set\
  \ foot into a store that claimed to sell \u201C100% Pure Kashmiri Pashmina\u201D\
  .\n\nThe store kept heaps of cloths in stacks of huge rows and columns all around\
  \ the shop. Mannequins were draped in bright coloured sweaters and shawls. A young\
  \ fair skinned man, with a neatly kept beard, green eyes and spiky hair greets us\
  \ into his store.\n\nHis excitement of seeing us enter didn\u2019t fade even though\
  \ he realised we couldn\u2019t afford his exquisitely priced Kashmiri pashmina sweaters.\
  \ Xhafu visits his native in Kashmir - where his wife & family await him - every\
  \ winter. Goats used for pashmina shed their winter coat in the spring, following\
  \ which he returns to Pokhara. \u201CLike every other Kashmiri who has migrated\
  \ here to make a way of living\u201D. His eyes still glint as he shares his excitement\
  \ of experiencing the first snowfall at the start of every winter. \u201CI swear,\
  \ there\u2019s nothing like it\u201D. Home also makes him miss cooking the popular\
  \ Kashmiri Goshtaba. A yogurt based dish used with freshly slaughtered meat, the\
  \ cooking of which is gathered by all his family members.\n\nXhafu was keen to show\
  \ us more of his Kashmir. He drew out a large heavy silk carpet. One of Kashmir\u2019\
  s specialty, a unique design language is used to create these intricately hand woven\
  \ royal carpets. A centuries old technique, \u201Cis still alive in some villages\
  \ in Kashmir\u201D says Xhafu, getting out his phone and showing a 14-minute clip\
  \ on YouTube of the whole process. \u201CWe all are still alive too, somehow. Insha\
  \ Allah\u201D.\n\nAs we prepare to leave, he gets a call. It\u2019s his Chinese\
  \ tutor asking if he can make it an hour earlier than usual. Xhafu has a lot of\
  \ loyal clients - all over the globe - that purchase regularly in plenty during\
  \ the season. \u201CI have many Chinese clients. So I wanted to learn Chinese to\
  \ improve my business\u201D. He shows a couple of WhatsApp texts with his clients\
  \ in Chinese. \u201CAt least my Kashmiri pashminas get to cross borders in full\
  \ freedom. No constant frisking and hatred and proving your good intentions. Nothing.\
  \ Nothing\u201D. He laughs.\n\nIt was a hot sunny afternoon and we were preparing\
  \ to leave Pokhara. We visited all our local friends that we made on the trip to\
  \ say a final goodbye. Entering Xhafu\u2019s shop, we were surprised not to find\
  \ him. We approach the counter and we find him lying on the floor, having an afternoon\
  \ siesta. Oblivious of our entry and not wanting to wake him up, we left Xhafu in\
  \ that peaceful position and state of mind \u2013 so it seemed.\n\nBack home, my\
  \ father handles the Kashmiri Pashmina sweater with utmost care as if holding a\
  \ delicate little infant. He places it in the suitcase, meticulously folded, on\
  \ top of all the other clothes.\n\nIts been a year since my encounter with Xhafu.\
  \ While I recall my conversations with him, the national dailies & TV channels are\
  \ celebrating the Indian Air Force striking a terrorist camp in Pakistan \u2013\
  \ India\u2019s response to the Pulwama suicide bombing attack, dubbed as the deadliest\
  \ terror attack witnessed in three decades of Kashmir's insurgency.\n\nWinter is\
  \ over and spring arrives soon. As does Xhafu to Pokhara with his fresh flush of\
  \ pashmina sweaters and shawls from across the border. The image of him lying peacefully\
  \ in his store, with doors wide open, is an arresting image."
