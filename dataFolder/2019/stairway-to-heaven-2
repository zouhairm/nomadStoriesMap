Text: "Switzerland makes the rest of Europe feel much cheaper. Cities like Zurich,\
  \ Geneva, Bern and Lucerne are world renown popular destinations and live up to\
  \ it's solid reputation now that I've been there. Switzerland to be such a stellar\
  \ country.\n\nThere's a hotel called Hotel Villa Honegg which is a must visit if\
  \ only for the spa and the perfect Instagram shot because it is like the stairway\
  \ to heaven. It is the perfect blend of man-made architecture and breathtaking nature.\n\
  \nSwitzerland has always been a country I\u2019ve long admired and have profound\
  \ respect for.  Singapore has been constantly trying to emulate Switzerland's high\
  \ standard of living and world class banking system but now that the student has\
  \ surpass its master in these areas, it is with great humility to hear that Switzerland\
  \ is trying to learn from Singapore too. Even though Switzerland can be inaccessible\
  \ to most because the country can be rather proud, expensive, cold, discreet and\
  \ distant, but that\u2019s exactly how I like it because it\u2019s what keeps it\
  \ exclusive, pristine, divine, safe and stable. \n\nDespite Switzerland's morally\
  \ ambivalent reputation, it showed me their warm spots whenever I\u2019m with it\
  \ and make me feel so special and taken care of, I never once felt less than a first\
  \ class citizen. I\u2019ve been preparing my whole life to be with someplace like\
  \ Switzerland and my love for the country is as persistent as a glacier, falling\
  \ all over it's highest points, solidifying during the cold and not melting away\
  \ during the summer when things heat up but instead continues to thicken over the\
  \ years and over the centuries."
