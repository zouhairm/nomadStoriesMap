Text: "It was our second day of holiday in Gold Coast. \nI opened the windows of my\
  \ apartment and felt the wind breezing. The atmosphere in this place was very relaxing,\
  \ made me lazy going outside until it was getting hot inside the room.\n\n\"Where\
  \ will we go today?\" I asked my dad.\n\n\"Up to you, don\u2019t go too far and\
  \ come back here before dawn\" said him.\n\nI murmured in that time like ouch, we\
  \ had been nowhere but the time was limited as my dad asked me to back home early.\n\
  \n\"Let's go, we still have tickets of Wet & Wild and Australian Outback Spectacular\"\
  , I said to my punctuate dad.\n\nLong story short, we finally walked around one\
  \ block to take the tram to Helensvale.\n\nThen, I realized that our balance of\
  \ transportation cards was getting decreased since yesterday and we had to refill\
  \ the cards by that day. As soon as we topped up the balance, the tram came and\
  \ we went down in Broadbeach. I had an interesting experience when we were about\
  \ to go up, when I tapped my transportation card, the driver said that my balance\
  \ was inadequate.\n\nThough my English communication skill was not well, I tried\
  \ to explain if I had already bought it on the machine. Then, I showed the transaction\
  \ receipt. Well, luckily, I didn't throw all the proof of the transaction during\
  \ my trip in a foreign country. The driver smiled and finally asked me and my father\
  \ to get on the tram.\n\nIn the tourist location, we went around for a while because\
  \ my father wanted to go back to the apartment soon. So, we walked to the previous\
  \ bus stop to return to the city.\n\nI thought I was riding the right bus line but\
  \ along the way there were many different paths from the previous day. However,\
  \ I really surprised! I assumed it would not be a problem because, wherever the\
  \ way is, we would arrive at Surfer Paradise, near to our apartment location.\n\n\
  I realized that I was misguided when I passed Main Beach. The bus should have taken\
  \ us from Main beach to 'Surfers Paradise', but for some reasons, on the city ring\
  \ line, the bus turned on a path that I didn't know. We were getting away from the\
  \ path we should be headed.\n\nFinally, I decided to take my father down from the\
  \ bus and opened the GPS to find the nearest tram line. Moreover, the existence\
  \ of technology was very helpful.\n\nI needed time to determine the right direction\
  \ to minimize getting lost. My father can grumble if he went wrong for too long.\n\
  \nAs I walked, I saw a very beautiful view of the beach. I stopped on a bridge and\
  \ was shocked to see the scenery ahead. At first glance, I forgot that I was lost\
  \ and wanted to find a right way.\n\nI saw a calm sea with its ships lined up, even\
  \ though the sky was slightly gray, the weather was warm and relaxing.\n\nI looked\
  \ some people were fishing. Besides, there were some people playing the jetpack\
  \ and the fly board. \n\nMy view was broken when my father asked me to continue\
  \ walking. I dissolved in my daydream because of the beautiful sea view.\n\nHonestly,\
  \ I was happy to get lost here. I didn\u2019t expect finding a very beautiful sea.\n\
  \nOn my way to the tram line, I saw someone in front of me, I chased toward him\
  \ and asked, \"Good afternoon Sir, can you tell me the nearest tram that goes to\
  \ Surfer Paradise?\"\n\n\"Oh sure\u201D, He said. Then, he opened the cellphone\
  \ and he pointed in one direction.\n\nOh thanks God, I thought my direction was\
  \ right.\n\n\"Do you understand enough what I mean?\" said the man to make sure\
  \ I would not get lost.\n\n\"I get it! Thank you very much for your kindness.\"\n\
  \nSo to speak, I noticed people were very helpful when we needed help. They also\
  \ conducted a brief research on their cellphone to make sure that his advice would\
  \ help us. What an interesting lost in the city!"
