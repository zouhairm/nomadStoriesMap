Text: "The last letter i had from him in my hands was writing by a machine. For the\
  \ last ten years i was used to wait every month for the brown envelope containing\
  \ the lines who encourage me to keep dreaming. That old friend of my Grandfather\
  \ became my writing mentor. Moving in and living in different places such as Salamanca,\
  \ Murcia, Pisa, Marnay-sur-Seine and Munich never felt the monthly letter from my\
  \ mentor. I was afraid about my writings, my feelings, my failures and he was always\
  \ asking me about the places i visited. One day we start talking about Pessoa, whose\
  \ name was new in my ears. \"Have you ever been in Lisbon?\" asked me - No but i\
  \ would love to. Then he sent me just some lines of a Poem by Fernando Pessoa and\
  \ that was all. The last letter send by him. Two months after that i landed at Lisbon\
  \ Airport looking for the trails of Pessoa's literature. I get lost in Alfama sitting\
  \ by the small kitchen of the tiny bar around the corner. I was sitting there with\
  \ the last letter of my mentor and a city plan while eating a fresh made \"bolinho\
  \ do Bacalhau\". The old woman who brought me the bolinho whispered something in\
  \ Portuguese: prazeres was the only word i could understand. The day after I took\
  \ the Tram 27 beyond the city centre, passing by the Statue of Pessoa in front of\
  \ the Cafe A Brasileira leaving the loud tourist groups behind. First I felt alone\
  \ by the door of the Cemit\xE9rio dos Prazeres but i crossed it and get into an\
  \ architecture's museum. All that graves and family chapel building to last, some\
  \ of them getting old and showing its scars on the stone. I walked through the castles,\
  \ statues, words and musical scores of those who passed away. I can not say how\
  \ long it took me to the end wall of the cemetery. Suddenly the 25th April bridge\
  \ was shining in front of me, on the other side. I smiled remembering all tips and\
  \ recommendations about Lisbon that my mentor wrote me.  Suddenly a poem from Pessoa\
  \ crossed my mind: \u201CThe poet is a faker / Who's so good at his act / He even\
  \ fakes the pain / Of pain he feels in fact.\u201D Goodbye dear mentor."
