Text: "It was a chilly Friday of January in Delhi. Much was anticipated from the trip\
  \ to Jaisalmer in Rajasthan, partly because it was a deviation from the usual winter\
  \ shivers, and partly due to the vacation being sponsored. \nFor a non-Indian who\
  \ has lived across India, the diverse flavours in each quarter of its vast expanse\
  \ will have been well-acquainted with. A North-Easterner (with mongoloid features)\
  \ that I am, and having traversed the maximum of all corners of India, my being\
  \ addressed \u2018Unindian\u2019 in my own soil pierces my soul at times. While\
  \ Eastern India is known for sports, Western India, Rajasthan in particular, is\
  \ renowned for its pompous forts. I was in to soak in the \u2018in season\u2019\
  \ of Jaisalmer. In my hometown in Manipur, I would welcome the January showers,\
  \ but there I was, caged inside the four walls, to subdue the icy-cold weather with\
  \ no sunshine. \n\n\u2018I want to break free\u2019, my ringtone buzzed. I picked\
  \ up, not letting the song end. \nThe voice from the other side whispered, \u201C\
  Meet me at the old Delhi junction at 5.25 pm\u201D. \nMy Ola driver dropped me right\
  \ on time. I boarded from platform number 10. My friend was already seated. After\
  \ a while of chit-chatting, we set our berths, side lower and upper, and rested\
  \ unperturbed: the best part of a fortnight journey by train. \nThe next morning,\
  \ we hurriedly devoured the complimentary breakfast, and headed towards \u2018Jaisalmer\
  \ Fort\u2019 and its vicinity. The city bewitched us with its locales of monuments\
  \ constructed mainly of sandstones and lime mortar. The enchantment was all ours.\
  \ \n\nAt the counter, my friend gestured for two tickets with her fingers, handing\
  \ over 100 bucks. The guard asked for 200 bucks more. \n\u201CWhy, Bhaiya?\u201D\
  \ my friend retaliated. \n\u201CMadam, you seem to be accompanied by a foreigner\u201D\
  , quick came his response, while motioning towards my direction. I was immersed\
  \ in the massive beauty all around. My friend shook me to slur a few words in Hindi.\
  \ \nI was stunned for some seconds and replied hastily, \u201CMain kya bolun? (What\
  \ do I say?)\u201D.\nThe cashier smiled and handed us our tickets. In my head, I\
  \ was totally unpleased. \nWhen will this conundrum end? \nBrushing aside my thoughts,\
  \ we entered the highly embraced Fort. Once inside, we loitered around every nook\
  \ and corner, and also the neighbourhood. It was mesmerizing. Every palace, temple,\
  \ lake, fort, and even chabutara (raised podium) in each aisle of this city displays\
  \ a grand touch of Architecture mastery with simple \u2018sandstone and lime mortar\u2019\
  \ work. \n        \t\t\t     \nSome adorn lime polish replicating polished marble.\
  \ During our visit, we encountered a contractor, whose family and ancestors have\
  \ worked for the Royals since \u2018THIRTY-SIX\u2019 generations. Unbelievable!\
  \ I don\u2019t know my great-great-grandfather. I was so intrigued I made a quick\
  \ quid pro quo with him, his workmanship and my design. \nAfter a much accomplished\
  \ period, we tried Rajasthani Ker Sangri curry (local vegetable cuisine) at the\
  \ Top View restaurant, and called it a day.\nThe chitter-chatter of the hotel guests\
  \ awoke us. It was already 7.30 am the next day. The sun shone effervescently on\
  \ the window panes. We ventured out, all geared up for the pre-booked adventurous\
  \ Safari ride. The excitement was high to dwell in tents, while absorbing the sundry\
  \ desertscape. The bumpy ride was compensated for by the experience of dunes and\
  \ rides on healthy camels. The night invited with the exemplary folklore performed\
  \ by local musicians. There were only five tents in the entire vastness of the desert.\
  \ There was no network either. My mother needn\u2019t be worried. She was pre-informed.\
  \ \n \nAmidst the wilderness, our tent housed an amazingly hygienic attached toilet,\
  \ a rare scene in Indian outskirts. The fact that I could tread this soil without\
  \ a passport is a wonderful gift of being an Indian. All this beauty in diversity\
  \ makes my \u2018Unindian' looks a \u2018Much ado about nothing\u2019 (halfway through\
  \ the iconic movie). \nFor a sneak peek, I stepped outside. The moon hovered in\
  \ the blue sky, the stars galore. Not everything is hunky dory in this life, yet\
  \ each day is lived. On a happy note, we dozed off humming the melodious Rajasthani\
  \ tune."
