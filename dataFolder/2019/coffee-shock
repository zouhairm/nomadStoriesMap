Text: "The decision to buy a backpack and go to Asia was purely the result of cheap\
  \ plane tickets and a newfound friend ready to dabble in spontaneity. Dane and I\
  \ had both heard stories of Thailand- stories of warm weather and friendly people\
  \ and the ability to live on a dime. The term \u201Cculture shock\u201D had had\
  \ no reality in either of our experiences; so when we arrived in a foreign city\
  \ of 9.5 million, after 20 hours on a plane, it felt like we had been swallowed\
  \ whole. The air that permeated Bangkok\u2019s atmosphere laid heavy; the energy\
  \ suppressed but high, like an overloaded circuit. Clusters of people approached\
  \ and receded in continuous swells, conversing in sounds my brain could not make\
  \ sense of.  My generally calm demeanor was suddenly threatened by waves of anxiety,\
  \ and disorienting confusion. \n\n     Our Bangkok experience consisted of 14 hours\
  \ of comatose sleep, wandering through riverside parks in a daze, and arguing when\
  \ we got lost in our search for a sacred temple. Halfway through the second day,\
  \ sitting in front of a box fan with sweat-stained shirts and desperately tired\
  \ eyes, some things became clear: 1)This city was not the best place to start our\
  \ first oversea adventure, and 2) We both needed the quiet and comfort that nature\
  \ provides. We found an online post that mentioned a farm, established in Buddhist\
  \ principles, with ample opportunities to garden, and cook, and learn in a meditative\
  \ environment. Without hesitation, we made the call and headed north. \n\n     The\
  \ days spent at what I will refer to as \u201Cthe farm\u201D clearly represented,\
  \ in my mind, an episode of Survivor. A one room wooden hut- not entirely enclosed-\
  \ way out in the untouched jungle. No beds, only straw mats and limited bedding.\
  \ The days were hot, and I spent the nights shivering in fetal position under a\
  \ mosquito net. The darkness brought unexplainable sounds, ideas of potential fears.\
  \ \u201CShowering\u201D consisted of dipping a small bucket into a larger bucket\
  \ of water, and the toilets were low and had to be manually flushed. Women were\
  \ expected to cover up and refrain from speaking. The man who ran the farm imparted\
  \ his knowledge through riddles, in a low gruff voice, and smoked more cigarettes\
  \ than anyone I had ever seen. His wife cooked all the food in the Lanna tradition-\
  \ a unique culture of northern Thailand- which I  instantly fell in love. At meals\
  \ we ate with our hands; it was not polite unless you slurped your tea. It was as\
  \ if we had been plucked out of comfy California and tossed into some unknown wilderness.\
  \ My mind desperately searched for something familiar, but there was nothing familiar\
  \ there. When I looked to Dane- the one thing I did know- his eyes revealed a similar\
  \ state of panic. It was not long before we escaped.\n\n     As the van weaved its\
  \ way towards the wooden sign that said \u201CWelcome to Pai\u201D the trees making\
  \ up the surrounding mountains sported the colors of fall. The sign across the street\
  \ from the hostel read \u201CStart your day with coffee and a smile\u201D. The first\
  \ morning, when I made my way over, the streets were not yet buzzing with motorbikes\
  \ and the chill in the air required time to find sensation in my fingers before\
  \ fumbling in my pockets for coins, The man dripping coffee wore a smile so genuine\
  \ it made his eyes squint. He was surrounded by grinders and kettles of all sorts,\
  \ accompanied by a little (almost) white dog sporting a dinosaur costume over soft\
  \ curly fur. For the first time since arriving in Thailand, I smiled with ease.\
  \ The all too familiar scent enveloped my senses as I graciously accepted the glass\
  \ cup and took a seat overlooking the rice paddies and palms. In the background,\
  \ some jazz-y piano tunes began to play. Suddenly the world did not feel so big\
  \ and scary. It was like all my fears had dissolved in the steam and the sounds.\
  \ In this foreign land, it turned out all I needed was coffee and a smile to make\
  \ me feel at home."
