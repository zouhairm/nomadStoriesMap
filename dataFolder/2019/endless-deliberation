Text: "I lay under the shade of a tree in a park in Prague. My packed itinerary lay\
  \ crumpled in my pocket, having no relevance in the moment. I was engrossed in flipping\
  \ through the pages of my copy of Calvin and Hobbes: It\u2019s a Magical World,\
  \ when one particular strip gave me pause; Calvin was telling Hobbes, \u2018There\
  \ is never enough time to do all the nothing we want to do.\u2019\n\nI couldn\u2019\
  t remember the last time I simply relaxed on a trip. For me, the soul of a place\
  \ only came alive when you looked for it, and sitting idle can\u2019t do that, \
  \ the more I thought about Calvin\u2019s statement, the uneasier I got. The soft\
  \ green grass suddenly seemed prickly and uncomfortable. The smell of fresh pretzels\
  \ from a nearby street vendor seemed somehow polluted; the wind itself felt as if\
  \ it was lifting me of the ground, telling me to stop lazing around. Confused and\
  \ not wanting to leave, Logic took over to convince me to be more productive on\
  \ my vacation. His tone was harsh and authoritative; it had confidence, as if he\
  \ knew he was right. It was the kind of voice that forced you to follow it.  \n\n\
  \ He asked me, \u2018The previous 5 days of this solo Europe trip, how have you\
  \ felt?\u2019. Knowing my answer was \u2018accomplished\u2019 he went to explain\
  \ why I felt so. In Berlin, i got lost in the pandemonium only a congregation of\
  \ patrons of German alcohol can create, while exploring the Oktoberfest. I had been\
  \ to four museums in Berlin, and even found amazing things like a 3-hour free tour\
  \ of the city by stumbling into an ongoing tour. \nI roamed the city all night,\
  \ and had a great conversation with a drug dealer, who had run away from his step\
  \ father and got entangled with the mafia.  Vienna was a rollercoaster ride, both\
  \ metaphorically and literally. I bathed in the city\u2019s rich history of where\
  \ famous people, like Sigmund Freud and Mozart lived for hours. Though I don\u2019\
  t recommend it there were way to many people, it felt like a \u2018find Waldo\u2019\
  \ page. And even though it turned out to be an okay experience, I only know that\
  \ because I saw it. But doing what I was doing, which was essentially lying around\
  \ and doing nothing, I was achieving nothing. \u2018What will you tell people when\
  \ they ask you what you did in Prague; the city of castles. That you slept in a\
  \ park reading a book?\u2019 if I had to I could read while walking , it was more\
  \ efficient. The crumpled paper in my pocket felt heavy with the weight of ignored\
  \ significance. I would be happier if I achieve something. Wouldn\u2019t I?\n\n\
  To my dismay, I couldn't counteract this logic. He was right; I wasn\u2019t accomplishing\
  \ anything. The more I reflected, the more he seemed right. As I was getting up,\
  \ I heard a different voice in my head. Unlike Logic, this one was feminine, and\
  \ seemed sweet like honey. It\u2019s a voice you could listen to every day, all\
  \ day long. She introduced herself as Heart. \n\nShe just asked me one thing, \u2018\
  Who are you doing this trip for?\u2019 She waited patiently, until she heard, my\
  \ answer: \u2018Myself.\u2019 Satisfied, she offered me a single point of view.\
  \  She told me that this trip was about exploring myself through travel. This trip\
  \ was not about proving anything to anyone. No experience is worthless. This got\
  \ me thinking about the last few days, where I was ticking things off my checklist.\
  \ Although I was enjoying the satisfaction of ticking off items, I was also exhausted.\
  \ In Prague, I had already been to the castle, found a leather market, and seen\
  \ an open-air art exhibition, but I still felt I had to do more. \n\nLike a pendulum,\
  \ I was swinging both ways. Both sides were correct this confused me even more.\
  \ Travel is both of these ideas, and till this day I don\u2019t have an answer as\
  \ to what I prefer. I guess travel is to each his own."
