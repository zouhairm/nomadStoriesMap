Text: "\"The greatest benefit of travel is to walk in a situation, suddenly recognise\
  \ yourself,\" proclaims a glossy billboard. I pause briefly in surprise at the oddly\
  \ poetic English translation before joining the customary dance of elbows onto the\
  \ X\u012B'\u0101n metro. The warning lights flash, whistles screech, and the train\
  \ doors slam shut mercilessly. As the jostling feet become still, inquisitive eyes\
  \ lock onto mine.\n\nIt's a strange feeling to discover both the familiar and foreign\
  \ in one place. The stares and whispers are commonplace in China where my half-Chinese,\
  \ half-Caucasian face seems to be quite a novelty. The locals are quick to ask about\
  \ my background and I'm quick to oblige them in broken Mandarin. The curiosity is\
  \ mutual, as I  find myself searching for answers to new questions about my family,\
  \ about me. The streets of China breathe life into my childhood memories, ones that\
  \ have faded over time or were perhaps only ever colourful fragments of my dreams\
  \ from long ago. \n\nI twist and turn through X\u012B'\u0101n's crowded Muslim Quarter,\
  \ moving with purpose but without direction. A month in China has left me craving\
  \ comfort food of the non-cheeseburger variety and I'm content to trust where my\
  \ stomach leads me tonight. My head snaps around to the unmistakable clanging of\
  \ a spatula and wok, the food spitting and hissing from the roaring flame underneath,\
  \ tamed by the expert hands of a sweaty man wearing incongruous chef's whites. Chai\
  \ tow kway (fried radish cake) - it's my mum's favourite. And despite the throng\
  \ of people and mopeds jostling and weaving around me, I stand my ground as I'm\
  \ suddenly buffeted by a wave of nostalgia.\n\nMy mum has always been blessed with\
  \ a ferocious appetite, but no patience for cooking. On the rare days when she was\
  \ \"feeling rich\" after finishing work late in the evening, she would drive me\
  \ and my brother to a grubby food hall near our home in suburban Western Australia,\
  \ the only place where she could find the Malaysian hawker foods of her youth. With\
  \ sharp eyes on her battlefield, she would pace around and snatch us a recently\
  \ vacated table, only sharing with strangers as a last resort and with a tight smile\
  \ through gritted teeth. I learned the art of war in that food hall, and a love\
  \ for all things wok-fried.\n\nIn a haze, I aimlessly rub my full belly and meander\
  \ through the streets of the Muslim Quarter, which are still buzzing with activity\
  \ under the dark sky. Each laneway seems to share the same flashing neon signs,\
  \ vibrant hijabs covered with golden sparkling webs, smoke wafting from grills loaded\
  \ with spiced lamb skewers. An elderly woman notices my greedy eyes fix onto her\
  \ tray of hot, sticky persimmon cakes. She calls out and gestures to draw me closer\
  \ with an energy that belies her frail physique. The fruity caramel aroma of the\
  \ cakes caresses my face and I'm powerless. Moments later, my teeth crack into a\
  \ delicate crispy shell, sink into the impossibly soft dough, and through to the\
  \ luscious, molten centre of sweet persimmon. She grins at me, her eyes crinkled\
  \ shut and her mouth full of gaps and yellow teeth. We are strangers, but I know\
  \ her smile.\n\nI am sitting cross-legged on the cracked tiles of the kitchen floor\
  \ as the ceiling fan chops listlessly through the muggy Malaysian afternoon. My\
  \ ah-cho (great-grandmother) squats down opposite me, her ancient mortar and pestle\
  \ between her feet. She effortlessly wields the heavy stone, crushing roasted peanuts\
  \ with sugar and salt. Later that day, I will sprinkle the peanuts in her home-made\
  \ popiah (fresh spring rolls) for the first and last time in my life. She chatters\
  \ to me in Hokkien, as I pepper her with questions in English. We don't know the\
  \ words, but we understand each other. She scoops out a small handful of crushed\
  \ peanuts for me to taste. I squeal in delight with a mouthful of sweet, salty,\
  \ nutty goodness and she grins at me, with yellowed teeth and crinkled eyes."
