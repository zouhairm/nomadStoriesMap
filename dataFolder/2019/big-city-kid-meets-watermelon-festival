Text: "Big City Kid Meets Watermelon Festival \nSamuel L. Hollis\n\n\nMy old man,\
  \ who some say is my father (jury is still out) lives in a far away land, many kilometres\
  \ (miles for our non-Brithish readers) from civilisation; a town named Chinchilla.\
  \ \nFor years since he moved he has tried to convince our family and I to visit\
  \ his dream town (like I said, jury is still out), and then one day he took advantage\
  \ of my damned curiosity; he asked me to check out the famous (apparently) Chinchilla\
  \ Watermelon festival. I have to admit, check mate Dad, checkmate. I had to go witness\
  \ this phenomena.  Apparently it is well known, but my father also thinks that knowing\
  \ how long the Murray river is should be well known knowledge, so I digress. \n\n\
  I managed to get out of driving on the four hour trip, and I must say, I\u2019m\
  \ glad I did. Not even because I\u2019m a lazy sod (I am), but because I forgot\
  \ how beautiful the countryside of Australia is. For those who think Australia is\
  \ just one giant rural countryside, you would find yourself wrong, we actually live\
  \ in coastal cities for the most part (breaking the stereotype, I know). So most\
  \ of what I saw was new, kilometres (miles) of plains and nothingness, but every\
  \ ten minutes or so you will drive past a mountain range larger than any coastal\
  \ city (breath taking), or an abandoned cattle station that has been taken back\
  \ by the elements (hauntingly beautiful). A long forgotten sense of relaxation starts\
  \ to creep in and washes away all of that city clutter that had been sitting there\
  \ in my bones. A sort of sense of belonging that only nature can provide. \nI started\
  \ to get excited.\nReaching the tiny town of Chinchilla (and no, there are no Chinchillas\
  \ here, disappointing, I know), I now understood why I never ventured here, there\
  \ was nothing. They say that a rural Australian town judges its success off how\
  \ many fast food chains reside there, Chinchilla had one. After stopping off at\
  \ the one fast food joint (tasted like the city), we ventured into the heart of\
  \ the festival (good thing about small towns though, everything is within walking\
  \ distance). To my surprise (and childish pleasure), we were greeted by a watermelon\
  \ ballon so big it could block the sun out with ease. The watermelon theme did not\
  \ stop there, or anywhere really. Name something out loud to yourself now, I\u2019\
  ll wait.\n\nExcellent. Now whatever you just named, I bet you one crisp high-five\
  \ that there was a watermelon themed or styled item there. Balloons, helmets, cars\
  \ (so many watermelon cars), buses, clothing items, sculptures, and probably 100\
  \ other things that have escaped my memory. It is safe to say, I was shocked, stunned,\
  \ and so very glad that I came along, and I had not even joined any activities yet.\
  \ There were many, but these two reserved a spot in my memories forever. I now know\
  \ that you never really know someone, until you have versed them at Mario Kart,\
  \ Monopoly, and Watermelon Bungee Tug of War. Essentially you get thrown into a\
  \ rubber pit with, you guessed it, with watermelons, and tied up on a bungee chord\
  \ along with another participant (this case, my younger sister) and then try to\
  \ be the first one out of the cold, sticky pit. Due to personal reasons, I will\
  \ not disclose who won, but talk about the next activity, watermelon skiing. You\
  \ have not lived your life to the fullest, until you place your feet within two\
  \ fresh watermelons, placed on a 50 metre long rubber mat, and pulled along by a\
  \ rubber chord.\nHesitant at first, the ridiculousness of the situation overtook\
  \ me and I found my inner kid jumping towards the surface of my adult sensibility,\
  \ and pushing it over, resulting in me giggling like joyful child every time I rocked\
  \ the watermelon boots. My father, seeing this, walked over to me with a smug smile\
  \ on his face.\n\u201CBet you couldn't do this in the city?\u201D he asked. \n\u201C\
  No,\u201D I replied, as I put on my watermelon boots for the 50th time."
