Text: "\u201CAre you willing to leave behind the life you know for me?\u201D asked\
  \ a Bajau fisherman in Indonesian. Of all the experiences I imagined my life to\
  \ be decorated with, a marriage proposal was definitely not one of them.\n \nIt\
  \ was a chilly night and the stars above the patch of sea I was on in Wakatobi Marine\
  \ National Park had no shame tonight. Bare and abundant, they blinked enthusiastically,\
  \ unlike my heart which beat in a confusion synchronous to my mind. With my feet\
  \ hanging off the edge of a rickety wooden bridge I feared might collapse at any\
  \ given moment and land me into an agonizing carpet of sea urchins, I wondered how\
  \ to respond. \n\n\u201CWhere would we live?\u201D I humoured him. \u201CWhere would\
  \ you want to live?\u201D He asked with coy smile, almost as though he knew what\
  \ I was about to say. I pointed to the black abyss ahead of us. \u201COver there.\
  \ In the middle of all the seas in the world.\u201D  He threw his head back and\
  \ laughed a hearty laugh. \u201CI will build the sailboat first thing in the morning\u201D\
  \ he exclaimed and I sighed, exasperated. \n\nThe question was rhetorical obviously,\
  \ because the Bajau are known as \u201Csea nomads\u201D. They have spent generations\
  \ living on hand-crafted sailboats roaming the South East Asian seas before finally\
  \ building settlements at various coasts traversing over five countries. Imagine,\
  \ a hundred thousand people, spread across hundreds of islands over the Coral Triangle,\
  \ but besides speaking the same language, they are bound by their unshakable belief;\
  \ that they are descendants of the sea. \n\nSeven weeks ago when I embarked on this\
  \ journey to complete a university obligation to serve communities \u201Cin need\u201D\
  , my air-filled head was overflowing with ideas on how I could possibly help an\
  \ indigenous population I knew next to nothing about. I was in my last year of medical\
  \ school and I knew routine health examinations was an easy answer. I wanted to\
  \ do something more.\n\nAlthough, I have been fortunate enough to travel many corners\
  \ of the world, this corner took my breath away. In the weeks I spent there, not\
  \ a single thought about my life and prior travels came to mind. As I step cautiously\
  \ every day over the hazardous bridges connecting this village hovering over the\
  \ sea, I was not reminded of the Autobahn in Germany. As I devoured fish that was\
  \ caught but a minute ago, raw and bloody, I did not think about the hotel buffet\
  \ breakfast I particularly enjoyed in a hotel in the South of India. The many stripy\
  \ sea snakes that litter the floors of the sea I take my evening swims in didn\u2019\
  t bring to mind the many camels I saw aid in transportation services in Egypt. \n\
  \nWithin just a few days, the language barrier dissipated and I talked to countless\
  \ amounts of people with the humble intention of getting to know them and their\
  \ unique culture. I learnt how to find firewood, strip them of their bark and make\
  \ a fire to cook all kinds of fresh sea life (whilst eating it raw during the preparation\
  \ process). I witnessed a ceremony whereby the placenta of a newborn was packaged\
  \ with rice and salt in banana leaf and bamboo to be sunk into the ocean as a blessing\
  \ to the ocean. I showered in the open public wearing a dangerously loose sarong\
  \ and ate more fish in seven weeks than I had in my entire life. I assimilated.\
  \ \n\nThe most shocking experience being the marriage proposal, was more humbling\
  \ than it was shocking. I was exposed to cultures and traditions similar to my own\
  \ but herein lies the difference; I had the option to choose anything else. While\
  \ I aimed for a career, he aimed for a family. While I dreamt of stability in the\
  \ form of a medical degree, he dreamt of the stability in the form of good weather\
  \ to fish in and enough fish to make it to all the tomorrows he can have. \n\nTravel\
  \ is not something I ever did with the mere intention of learning something new\
  \ about some other place or people, but also to learn who I am."
