Text: "It was 2015 and my life had not turned out as I thought it would. I was thirty,\
  \ jobless, living out of my car, and sleeping on my family\u2019s couch in a sleeping\
  \ bag for Christmas. Earlier that morning, I had unceremoniously been handed a diary\
  \ that had been found in a box in the basement. My dad had written it twenty-seven\
  \ years earlier, after he had been diagnosed with stage four melanoma (skin cancer),\
  \ and been told that he had six months to live.\n\n\u201CCyrus, Darius and I got\
  \ back Saturday night from five days camping in Arches\u2026\n\nI am bothered by\
  \ how little C and D will remember if I die. At five, D will remember virtually\
  \ nothing of the trip and of me when he becomes an adult\u2026\n\nMaybe indirectly,\
  \ in a love for the outdoors or in a good feeling about that time in their lives\
  \ they will remember. But, boy, for me now, staying alive is the only solution\u2026\
  \n\nToday, when I go home, my job is to clean up the camping stuff, which I brought\
  \ in from the car last night. I have already washed the sleeping bags, which Cyrus\
  \ and Darius both peed in, even though they were dried on top of the tent. \n\n\
  I take out the red rubber catheter, which has been my companion for the past month\
  \ or so. Then, finally, the wounds relating to my liver surgery can heal for good.\u201D\
  \n\nI remember that Arches trip. I remember where we camped. I remember the juniper\
  \ tree my brother climbed, poking his head out from the branches, like a gopher\
  \ from its hole. While these snapshots exist in my head, none included my dad\u2019\
  s cancer. I remember the red rocks of Utah, but not the red catheter, which I am\
  \ sure he would have told us about, we were little boys, peeing in a bag would have\
  \ been up there with arm pit farts, in terms of hilarity. Maybe he was trying to\
  \ protect us until we were old enough to understand, but I do not remember alpha\
  \ interferon, or metastatic lesions. All of my memories are of a dad taking his\
  \ two boys camping; I never knew what he was going through.\n\nI wanted to respond.\n\
  \n\u201CDo you remember that trip to Arches?\u201D\n\u201CYes dad, I remember. I\
  \ read Desert Solitaire, and I went back. I took friends, and I can\u2019t wait\
  \ to have kids so that I can take them too.\u201D\n\n\u201CDid I give you a love\
  \ for the outdoors?\u201D\n\u201CYes dad. You did. I quit my job and did a road\
  \ trip to visit all 59 National Parks and celebrate the 100th anniversary of the\
  \ National Park Service.\u201D\n\n\u201CDid you stop peeing in your sleeping bag?\u201D\
  \n\u201CI sure hope so, because I\u2019m sleeping on the couch tonight. I can\u2019\
  t say the same for Cyrus, but he has three kids now, so one of them is surely continuing\
  \ the family tradition.\u201D\n\nI finished reading the journal, wiped the tears\
  \ from my eyes, and slept on the couch. The following morning I slipped out of my\
  \ sleeping bag, walked into the kitchen, and grabbed a cup of coffee. I sat down\
  \ at the table and turned to my dad.\n\n\u201CWhy didn\u2019t you ever tell me about\
  \ the journal?\u201D\n\u201CWell I survived, so it was kind of moot point. I also\
  \ forgot about it until I found in a box downstairs.\u201D\n\nI was not sleeping\
  \ in a sleeping bag on my parent\u2019s couch because something was wrong, rather\
  \ everything was incredibly right. I dumped the girl, quit my job, packed my belongings\
  \ into a truck and set off to visit all 59 National Parks. By the time Christmas\
  \ rolled around I had visited twenty-one of our parks and was just off of a three\
  \ week rafting trip down the Colorado River in Grand Canyon. \n\nI left several\
  \ days letter, to complete the trip. I took my dad\u2019s diary with me. I wasn\u2019\
  t looking for validation when I started the trip, but I had unexpectedly found it\
  \ written twenty-seven years earlier, as my dad was dying of cancer, wishing that\
  \ he could give his children a love for the outdoors."
