Text: "'Hurry, hurry!'\n\nAs I watched the half-conscious woman being carried down\
  \ the mountain, I felt a sinking feeling of despair, as I contemplated quitting.\n\
  \nIt's the best mountain trek for someone like you, they said. In reality, I was\
  \ just too na\xEFve. Having never climbed a mountain, never slept in a tent, never\
  \ experienced high altitude \u2013 I unwittingly challenged myself with 19,000 ft\
  \ worth of mountain.\n\n'Move aside!'\nPebbles grumbled under the feet of humans\
  \ scurrying down to safe altitudes. Another woman had been found unconscious while\
  \ on a quick toilet break. I hope she\u2019s okay..\n\nNature is made to respect.\
  \ Nature is a powerful, cruel god, who doesn't care you paid big bucks to \u2018\
  go on adventures\u2019. For its mercy, you start praying. \nI was only a weak mouse.\
  \ Braggingly dragging my feet and snapping pictures of my achievements, while porters\
  \ half my size ran up, and down, and up again - carrying water, and food and tents.\
  \ They were the real heroes.\n\n\u2018Some say the world will end in fire...\u2019\
  \ My English teacher would laugh if she knew I was quoting Frost\u2019s poem while\
  \ climbing Kilimanjaro! \nIf my world ended, it'd clearly be ice. \nMy hell doesn't\
  \ have one spark of fire in it. My hell is pitch black, and cold as a polar bear\u2019\
  s picnic.\n\n\u2018Pole pole\u2019 I heard The Professor, our lead guide, say. \n\
  After my pitiful gloves bailed on me, one hour into the climb, he\u2019d given me\
  \ his own mittens - and a vigorous rub to get the blood flowing in my hands again.\
  \ Lucy placed a couple of hand warmers in my palms. Let\u2019s pray for sunrise\
  \ now.\n\nHeroes they are. \nSmiling and playing cards with us, after they\u2019\
  d carried our stuff, put up tents, cooked our food. While we'd become soft in our\
  \ fake worlds made up of memory foam mattresses, AC and chai lattes. \n\nThey are\
  \ the heroes of this story. Tirelessly climbing up, and down, and up again, to achieve\
  \ the dreams and whims of a puny mouse.\nI was sure as cold black hell wasn't going\
  \ to quit now. After all the work our porters had put in, just to make it easy for\
  \ me. \n\nAs I finally approached the fluttering flags lining Uhuru, tears of exhaustion,\
  \ joy, and masochistic satisfaction started to flow down. I wasn't the weakling\
  \ I feared; I had conquered hell and turned it into paradise.\n\nAnd my heroes became\
  \ angels. The porters who carried me and my modern day comfort, so I can stand a\
  \ chance in hell. \nThey are the real heroes of this story. \nShaping dreams into\
  \ reality, 19 000 feet up towards the roof of Africa."
