Text: "My co-passenger on the bus from Bengaluru to Kushalnagar was an older woman.\
  \ After we exchanged partial life histories, she was the second person in 24 hours\
  \ to ask me why I was going to Coorg. She was also the second person in 24 hours\
  \ to treat my answer like it was the sanest reason to make the trip (\u201CI\u2019\
  m going for the coffee.\u201D). Two weeks after I turned twenty-five, I got carried\
  \ away and travelled 2400 kilometres from New Delhi to Coorg and bought coffee.\
  \ I returned with 70% Arabica mixed with 30% Robusta and stories of the kindness\
  \ of strangers.\n\nAt Kushalnagar, I was gearing up to negotiate with auto-rickshaw\
  \ drivers using a combination of the 3 Indian languages I spoke. Before I could\
  \ do that, my friend of 6 hours introduced me to her brother. She stated simply\
  \ that they would drop me off at the hostel. Once on the road, I sensed her brother\
  \ sounding grumpy about giving me a ride. The grumpiness vanished when he found\
  \ out I was also south Indian and in his \u2018hood for coffee. A guided tour began.\
  \ Highlights included a former finance minister's estate, a lecture on types of\
  \ coffee plants, and a deep dive into the history of the region. Further guidance\
  \ was given on my intended coffee purchase: I was to walk to Siddapur from my hostel.\
  \ In the market, near the petrol station, I would find Raju coffee mills. I was\
  \ to ask for 700 grams of Arabica and 300 grams of Robusta, mixed. At this point,\
  \ his sister registered her protest against these proportions. He stood his ground\
  \ and declared that if I wanted to make my parents happy and this trip a success,\
  \ this was the answer. Lastly, I was to tell Raju that Madhu had sent me.\n  \n\
  Siddapur was an hour-long walk. I\u2019m a city girl but I know what towns look\
  \ like. Small towns on the other hand, I had no idea about; especially in a region\
  \ where everyone I had interacted with owned coffee estates. When I was told to\
  \ go to a 'mill', I pictured a factory. I expected the petrol station to look like\
  \ the one I drove my car to. Before I knew it, I had walked the length of the town\u2019\
  s main street. My mobile data was failing me with poor connectivity. I purchased\
  \ coconut water in exchange for information about Raju and his coffee mills: dialogue\
  \ apt for a Bollywood thriller. The vendor pointed to a shop that advertised selling\
  \ coffee, opposite what resembled the ghost of a petrol station. I decided to take\
  \ my chances and walk into Laxmiganesh Rice Mill and Spice House.\n \nI met Raju.\n\
  \ \nA middle-aged, ever-smiling man, Raju could speak Tamil (my mother tongue).\
  \ His store had a unique mix of smells - freshly ground coffee and spices. He was\
  \ expecting me. Madhu had stopped by a few hours earlier to inform him of my impending\
  \ visit. When I insisted on the 70-30 mix, he mocked my sincerity by asking whether\
  \ I\u2019d be okay if it was 80-20 or 65-35. But he knew Madhu would hold him accountable.\
  \ I purchased multiple kilograms for family without considering whether my backpack\
  \ could take it. When I handed over a 2000 rupee note to pay, Raju stared at me\
  \ in disbelief. I wondered if the note was fake or if he didn't have enough change.\
  \ Raju hadn\u2019t seen the magenta spectacle before \u2013 it had been in circulation\
  \ only for a year. He stepped out of his store and asked passers-by for change.\
  \ Soon other store owners and passers-by joined him in looking at the note and exclaiming\
  \ utter fascination. From the girl who came to Coorg to buy coffee, I became the\
  \ girl with the 2000 rupee note.            \n \nAfter the excitement died down,\
  \ I asked Raju to recommend an evening coffee destination. I was to walk left, cross\
  \ the town bus station, and find the Udupi Hotel. This was the second time that\
  \ day I received guidance on where to find my coffee. It was also the second time\
  \ that day I received directions with a seemingly obvious landmark, leading to another\
  \ small-town adventure."
