Text: "By the time the passengers had emerged from the grey bulk of the Vancouver\
  \ transit centre, tickets scanned and bags weighed, the sun had risen over the city:\
  \ sudden and disarmingly bright. Grey, sun-bleached curtains were yanked irritably\
  \ across greasy windows. Neck pillows were unearthed, ear phones inserted. Jackets\
  \ strategically strewn across adjacent seats, a hostile declaration of claimed space.\n\
  \nAt 7:03am the Greyhound hissed into life and rolled into the city. I glimpsed\
  \ reflections of the bus as it slid across the tinted windows of high rises, listening\
  \ to the cheerful voice of the bus driver intoning stops and arrival times. The\
  \ woman across the aisle from me was a puff of grey hair emerging from a pink cardigan.\
  \ She had long fingers which worried at a plastic bag in her lap. In front of her,\
  \ a tangle of limbs snoring softly, was a guy around my age. I observed his disheveled\
  \ appearance: dark circles under his eyes, stubble and hair poking in all directions,\
  \ and diagnosed a hangover. It was going to be a long 17 hours.\n\nWe settled into\
  \ the rhythm of the day. Every few hours the bus would remain at a stop for long\
  \ enough to allow those traveling on to grab food or coffee. One time the bus began\
  \ to move off, except hungover guy was not in his seat: just headphones and a dog-eared\
  \ book. \u201CHey,\u201D I called lamely, half jogging to the front, \u201Cthere\u2019\
  s a guy not back yet.\u201D At that moment he emerged from the building, smiling\
  \ sheepishly. He held up a burger in a paper bag, shiny and clear in spots with\
  \ grease, by way of explanation. His name was Matt. He was headed to Jaffray: near\
  \ my destination.\n\nI stretched out across the newly vacated back seat and took\
  \ in the immensity of the Canadian Rockies. When the bus rounded sharp corners I\
  \ was thrust out alarmingly over cliffs which dropped away sharply from the highway:\
  \ the caboose of a train hanging on for dear life. I looked in awe at immense, jagged\
  \ mountains and lakes in shades of vivid blue. \n\n21 months left of a two year\
  \ youth working holiday visa stretched before me dauntingly. A blank canvas which\
  \ I was suddenly to fill on my own. I seesawed between feelings of freedom so boundless\
  \ it made me giddy, and aloneness so profound I had to blink back tears. I caught\
  \ the eye of old lady in the pink cardigan, and she smiled warmly. Her name was\
  \ Dierdre. The wool from the plastic bag in her lap was being transformed at an\
  \ impressive rate into a very small, green sweater. She was on her way to meet her\
  \ fifth grandson.\n\nThe hours rolled on and day turned into night. Matt and I stood\
  \ outside the bus at a small gas station off the Crowsnest Highway, enjoying the\
  \ crisp air and shaking out cramped limbs. The moonless sky stretched out above\
  \ us, peaceful and immense, peppered with bright stars. A gentle wind rustled the\
  \ tall fir trees, an ocean of small dark movements which stretched over the ridge\
  \ and beyond. It was quiet except for the occasional cheerful automated \u2018ding\u2019\
  \ of the gas station door. \n\n\u201CWhat\u2019s in Jaffray?\u201D I asked. The\
  \ tip of Matt\u2019s cigarette bloomed into a bright red in the darkness as he inhaled.\
  \ \u201CMy parents. Need some detox time,\u201D he said, with a directness that\
  \ impressed me. \u201CGone down a bit of a rabbit hole lately. Partying, wasting\
  \ money. I\u2019m having a quiet winter.\u201D \n\nI was touched by his candor,\
  \ and felt emboldened by the darkness. \u201CI just left my boyfriend,\u201D I volunteered,\
  \ \u201CI wanted to start again somewhere new.\u201D The little red ember bobbed\
  \ up and down as he nodded. The next stop was his, and he raised a hand in farewell\
  \ and gave me a smile as he stepped off. \n\nThen it was my turn. As we pulled up,\
  \ I found myself moving slowly, all of a sudden reluctant to leave the warm safety\
  \ of the bus. Dierdre gave me a reassuring smile and I smiled back, heartened. I\
  \ edged my way down the aisle, and stepped out into the night."
