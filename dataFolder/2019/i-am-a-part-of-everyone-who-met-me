Text: 'One day I read this saying "I am a part of everyone who met me" and I did not
  understand its meaning well, and since it was unknown to me, the way it might lead
  me to understanding is also unknown.I was on my way to India and felt it would be
  a great trip because when I put my legs in Rajiv Gandhi International Airport, I
  heard strange music with Hindu music, Sufi Islamic music, and Sikh strings vibrations
  And I learned that the state is a mixture, because music expresses their feelings,
  that music was able to reassure anyone that he will not feel alienated.

  I went first to participate in a scientific conference in Hyderabad, met people
  of different nationalities, we visited a group of famous teacher Charminar and its
  market, and found that each person, despite their different nationalities, find
  a common denominator between him and the Indians whether it is foodTheir food contains
  too many spices like us in Morocco, or the quality of the dress, which is very similar
  to the desert dress, or the fabrics you find in different colors, whatever your
  taste will find what suits you, whether clothes, almost every color and shape you
  will find, With regard to the foods especially the vegetarian food  and you can
  eat meat there also except for the forbidden cow,When I was walking, I discovered
  that the mixture I spoke about went beyond the visible dimension to the spiritual.
  In India, there are temples where the architecture of the Mongols overlaps with
  the Islamic style, or with Sikh and even Hindu thought, as if they are building
  their souls, not their hands.I went to the Taj Mahal after a separate train for
  more than 23 hours. I was very impressed by its unique architecture, which still
  tells the story of a historical love story. I visited New Delhi and found there
  many religious and other nationalities belonging to all the Indians.Such as the
  India gate, for example, may be the meaning of its establishment to show all Indians
  that no matter how different religions and values, but they unite under the banner
  of one stateI have experienced very difficult conditions, the Indians were assistants
  whether young or old, traditional or modern, and perhaps the worst was the difficulty
  of booking trains because of the great demand for tickets, but I faced those challenges,
  and I discovered a civilization full of symbols and colors,Maybe I''m Moroccan,
  but I felt that India gives you freedom of choice and freedom of choice in any field,
  so you feel there is someone who looks like you , you will find someone like you
  in belief, and another in your favorite color, and another in the way your clothes,
  when You go to India, you play the game of searching for yourself among others,
  a static beyond one billion means that every possibility exists there, generally
  you will discover that you are a part of everyone there.In India I understood the
  meaning of the saying "I am a part of everyone who met me"'
