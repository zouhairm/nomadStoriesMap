Text: "As the car stopped on a rocky, abandoned road of the village, we got more confused:\
  \ what language should we talk with this people?\nI opened the door of the car stepping\
  \ into the land which was said to be an Armenian-Azerbaijani village. To clarify\
  \ why this was so odd to me, I should probably let you know, that the war between\
  \ these 2 countries (Armenia and Azerbaijan) hadn\u2019t stopped since 3 years before\
  \ I was born. You can hardly find an Azerbaijani in Armenia, or vice versa. Instead,\
  \ you can easily find troops on both borders and hatred in societies.\nThis is why\
  \ studying in the same group with Azerbaijanis was already something new for me,\
  \ strange but still interesting. But finding out this village in Georgia called\
  \ Tsopi was even stranger. Little did I know back then that I was going to find\
  \ the best material for my Travel Blog out of google maps and far from smooth roads\
  \ of Western Georgia\u2024\nWe approached some people standing in front of an old\
  \ peeled building. My Azerbaijani group mate started talking to them in his native\
  \ language. Some of them entered the building with him to continue the interview\
  \ inside. I stayed there in the street, took the camera from my bag and started\
  \ filming the backyard. Three middle aged men were in my shot, talking in Azerbaijani.\
  \ I was looking to them through the camera when all of a sudden the language of\
  \ their conversation changed into Armenian. I turned the camera off, my hand was\
  \ falling down from this surrealistic scene I was witnessing.\n\u2022\tAre you Armenian?\
  \ \u2013 I asked them.\n\u2022\tWhich one of us? \u2013one of them laughed, looking\
  \ at my surprised face.\n\u2022\tWhich one of you is? \u2013 I smiled.\n\u2022\t\
  I am Armenian and this guy is Azerbaijani, - he said and patted slightly on the\
  \ shoulder of the man standing next to him. \nI turned my camera on and went on\
  \ filming. They were standing in front of me, holding each other\u2019s arms, talking\
  \ in my language.\n\u2022\tThere were times he stayed at our place and vice versa,\
  \ - told the Armenian one pointing to his Azerbaijani neighbor. \n\u2022\tWe grew\
  \ up together, we went to the same school. \nAnother man approached us while I was\
  \ talking to them.\n\u2022\tWhose daughter are you? \u2013 He asked me in Armenian\
  \ and put his arm on my shoulder to hug me.\nAsking this question is a \u201Cmust\u201D\
  \ in the villages of our region. Whenever someone from the city comes, it is either\
  \ someone\u2019s child or grandchild, who left the village long ago.\n\u2022\tShe\
  \ is a journalist from Yerevan, and this guy is from Baku.\nThe village was just\
  \ a few kilometers away from Georgian-Armenian border, were the peace ends and hatred\
  \ starts. \n\u2022\tMaybe you are young and you haven\u2019t seen it, but people\
  \ of these 2 nations used to live together peacefully long ago.\nIn several hours\
  \ I was standing in the middle of the nowhere, shooting the collapsed roads, when\
  \ a group of schoolchildren approached.\n\u2022\tSalam Aleikum , - one of them said\
  \ with a smile.\n\u2022\tAleikum Salam, - I answered in Azerbaijani.\nWe were in\
  \ the car again, hitting back to Tbilisi. My Azerbaijani groupmate showed me the\
  \ pictures he took in Tsopi.\n\u2022\tDon\u2019t forget to send them to me, - I\
  \ said.\n\u2022\tOne lari each, - he joked. \n\u2022\tArpi, do you have money? \u2013\
  \ All of a sudden our Georgian driver asked me.\n\u2022\tWhy? \u2013 I got confused.\n\
  \u2022\tIt\u2019s time to sell this guy to Armenians and get some money, - he laughed.\n\
  Our laughter followed his. \nThey will tell me it\u2019s not possible. They will\
  \ try to convince me these 2 nations cannot live with each other again. But I have\
  \ already seen another reality. \nI looked through the window as the group of dark\
  \ black starlings flew over the car. I lowered my head and opened the window. I\
  \ felt a sudden liberation. All the hatred I used to carry on with me fell down\
  \ from my shoulders. Finally, I could breathe."
