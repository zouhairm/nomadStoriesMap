Text: "A few years ago, I fulfill one of my biggest goals in life. To made a trip\
  \ to Chile and study one of the most garrulous and fulsome careers in the world:\
  \ Journalism. This experience gave me the opportunity to enhance my intrapersonal,\
  \ social, economical and professional skills in every way, and even though I still\
  \ don\u2019t have the right answers for every decision in my life, I\u2019m pretty\
  \ sure this adventure made me ask the right questions. So here we go.\n\nWhen I\
  \ came to Santiago, I made an exchange year in great university but surprisingly\
  \ none of my truly meaningful stories happened inside the classroom, but quite the\
  \ opposite.\n\nI\u2019ve met the bravest, adventuress and kindest of people throughout\
  \ my journey, one of them was Alicia,  a Latin-American woman inside a European\
  \ body, ready to become a pedagogue and teach our future generations the interpersonal\
  \ skills that the humans need in order to make the world a better place. We met\
  \ at the house of the famous poet Pablo Neruda called \u201CLa Chascona\u201D which\
  \ means disheveled so I thought \u201CWhat a great coincidence to meet you here!\u201D\
  \ since both of us hate to comb, then I realized it was my lack of knowledge about\
  \ feminism and gender equity what united us when she started yelling to all Neruda\u2019\
  s pictures \u201CWhy don\u2019t you shut up?!\u201D Referring to his famous poem\
  \ \u201CI like you when you shut up\u201D written to one of his many lovers. \n\n\
  Alicia introduced me to Lilo, a Chilean drummer with the most eclectic music taste\
  \ ever. The three of us became instant friends. So, we decided to live our greatest\
  \ adventure from the driest desert in the world (Atacama) to a magical island full\
  \ of myths and legends within the Patagonian land (Chilo\xE9). We survived a couple\
  \ of earthquakes, a hive of furious bees and more than fifty hours of travel by\
  \ bus, boats and free rides. But our most amazing story happened in Valdivia.\n\n\
  Lilo had a friend called Juan Ma who lived in a cabin within the Valdivia's forest,\
  \ so we asked him if we could crash his place and he totally agreed to. When we\
  \ arrived, the house was crowded so we introduced ourselves as \u201CEl tr\xEDo\
  \ escalofr\xEDo\u201D just to break the ice, and fortunately, it did. We were totally\
  \ rocking that party, until we saw a tall, serious man making one of Alicia's favorite\
  \ dish \"tortilla de papa\" by himself, so we decided to move to the kitchen and\
  \ start making small talk with him, until I saw one of his neck tattoos, an eagle\
  \ devouring a snake just like the one in Mexico's flag, I was so amazed to see a\
  \ non-Mexican person having one of our most symbolic animals in his neck, therefore\
  \ I asked him the story behind his tattoo and he happily agreed to.\n\nAlfonso spent\
  \ 3 years in a prison in Barcelona in one of the most controversial trials in Catalan\
  \ history. The reason: To hit a police officer who was using an illegal weapon (kubotan)\
  \ against one of his friends in a pacific protest. If you ask him if he would had\
  \ done it again, the answer would always be affirmative.\n\nAlfonso's prison had\
  \ a small window overlooking a mountain through which an eagle passed every day.\
  \ For him, looking out the window at the imposing bird gave him a feeling of unparalleled\
  \ freedom so he asked his Mexican friend who was also the official tattooist, to\
  \ capture that moment in his skin. He only knew how to draw Mexican eagles but folks,\
  \ that was not an impediment for a man in search of his freedom.\n\nThe three of\
  \ us were astonished by the story but Alicia had a special look on her face, like\
  \ when you see a family member that you haven't seen in over ten years.\_\n    \
  \          \n\u2013\tI can't believe it, you're Alfonso Hermoso?\n\u2013\tYes I\
  \ am.\n\u2013\tI protested for your freedom 9 years ago, I even sent you letters!\n\
  \u2013\tPeople sent me tons of letters but the ones that only matter where those\
  \ of my daughter.\n\u2013\tI need to hug you.\n\u2013\tWe need to hug everybody\
  \ in this party!"
