Text: "Writing on the Wall\nWhen walking Valpara\xECsos plan I sometimes find the\
  \ ground hard to slender on, the city whispers to me: \u201ETake your time, I am\
  \ not a quick fix. I won\u2019t tell you my story in a rush.\u201C So I stop and\
  \ try to listen to the often complicated and mostly hidden stories - slowly with\
  \ one foot in front of the other I try to decipher the writings on the wall of each\
  \ new city, now Valpara\xEDso. I find old houses full of history and broken walls\
  \ with new and colourful writing on it. While stepping the stones, climbing the\
  \ stairs and riding the escolares I encounter bellavistas over the port to the dunes\
  \ and thereafter the foggy horizont which will prevent me from seeing the magic\
  \ moment of the sun disappearing at a glance in the sea. La grande dame de la mer\
  \ hides her inner depths and only shows a silver sliver of her real tale and beauty\
  \ in the centre. But, there is more. Still: Que lindo.\nHowever high up between\
  \ the ravines, with every seeking step I take another story of this jewel reveals\
  \ itself. It\u2019s the story of it\u2019s people, of each individual one of them.\
  \ I see stones and steelplates being added to the houses, to this city, built on\
  \ hill after hill, and therefore adding to her and their accounts. Bit by bit their\
  \ narative grew as their houses, building something greater than themselves. This\
  \ way of story-telling seems to be a different kind of art, one I've never experienced\
  \ in this way ever before. And their chronicle was and is still growing. They keep\
  \ adding to it, for new arrivals, old friends, new vocations \u2013 room by room\
  \ adding to the city of Valpara\xEDso and telling the story of it\u2019s people\
  \ one house at a time. So I tread along the walls and decipher the signs created\
  \ by their growing. Their evolving colorfully filling the pages of its book. Radiantly\
  \ gleaming around dark corners, just like life. There is the need to treat carefully\
  \ while exploring the shadows and the freedom to jump joyfully in the broad sunshine.\n\
  Just like life Valpara\xEDso has and is both at the same time. Light and dark, ugly\
  \ and charming. Por ejemplo: Stumpling on the dirt I appreciate the kindly placed\
  \ water buckets all over the city for the countless dogs on the street. Surprisingly\
  \ well-nourished they display the great care the human inhabitants of this metropolis\
  \ have for these abandoned but now free-roaming companions.\nJust alike them, the\
  \ Porte\xF1os roaming the streets, filling the micros, hailing the collectivos and\
  \ driving the uber have taken me in their mids for a while. Not as their own, but\
  \ as a german gringa tolerated as well as supported in her quest. Her quest to understand\
  \ what life is all about. It seems to me, they all know the answer without knowing\
  \ \u2013 it\u2019s just me wandering around lost. But they call everything by it\u2019\
  s name and are satisfied with it. I sit and wonder, trying to read them while they\
  \ pass me by, not always with a smile on their faces but invariably with a stroke\
  \ in their hand for the next four-legged pooch or hound.\nI go on following the\
  \ writings on the wall. Paintings, sculptures, cracks and crevices divulge their\
  \ inner workings, their epic of want and need, old and recent, resistance and uprising.\
  \ A face divided by the windows of the staircase ranked with blooming flowers overlooking\
  \ mercado cordonal. Scribbles, often undecipherable, at times patterns for the local\
  \ football team as well as markings for the area of the local drug-dealer band.\n\
  But one writing on the wall I never expected to find and it has become especially\
  \ dear to me. Going up the alternate route to Santiago it sits in a wide narrow\
  \ curve climbing the first hill. Unassumingly it says:\n\u201EGl\xFCcklich\u201C\
  \nJust one single word in curved handwriting. \u201EHappiness\u201C in german. A\
  \ sign without a sender, a message for the finder. The writing on the wall guiding\
  \ me, leading the way on the grey dirty stonesnakes ridden by thousands upon millions\
  \ of stories each day up the hills. For now I stay."
