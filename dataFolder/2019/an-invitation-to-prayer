Text: "\u201CAre we really going to see another cathedral?\u201D Tyler asked. After\
  \ two weeks in Spain, my teenage son was tired of my fascination with churches.\
  \ Through Madrid, Granada, Valencia, and Alicante I dragged him into every cathedral\
  \ we passed. Although I claimed no religious affiliation, or belief in a higher\
  \ power for that matter, something about cathedrals (especially old ones) called\
  \ to me. \n\n\u201CSort of,\u201D I said. \u201CThe Sagrada Familia is a basilica.\u201D\
  \ \n\nTyler just rolled his eyes and said, \u201CWhat's the difference?\u201D\n\n\
  \u201CA cathedral is home to a bishop, but the Pope must designate a basilica,\u201D\
  \ I answered.\n\n\u201CI don\u2019t understand,\u201D Ty said.\n\n\u201CMe neither.\
  \ All I know is that basilicas are rare.\u201D On any other day, I might have googled\
  \ the difference, but I was anxious to begin our adventure.\n\nConstruction of the\
  \ Sagrada Familia started in 1882 and, when Gaudi died in 1926, the project was\
  \ less than a quarter complete. Large portions of the building were still under\
  \ construction and it is projected the building will not be completed until 2026,\
  \ 100 years after Gaudi\u2019s death. When finished, the Sagrada Familia will have\
  \ taken longer to be built than the Egyptian Pyramids and will be the tallest church\
  \ building in the world. It will have 18 towers, 12 representing the apostles, 4\
  \ evangelists, 1 for the Virgin Mary, and the last representing Jesus. \n\nDuring\
  \ our visit, only 8 of the 18 towers were complete. \n\nWhile waiting for the Sagrada\
  \ Familia to open, I walked around the building and admired the exterior, every\
  \ inch adorned with all kinds of sculptures \u2014 snails, turtles, lizards, and\
  \ snakes crawling up the pillars, life-size knights on horseback, cubist-style depictions\
  \ of Jesus hanging from a cross, towering columns in mosaic tile, huge sections\
  \ of wall adorned in an art d\xE9co stucco designs, and disciples, angels and trumpeters\
  \ in Romanesque-style. Everywhere I looked there was something different to see.\n\
  \nOnce inside, I became overwhelmed at the architecture and beauty surrounding me.\
  \ Rather than simple block or round pillars holding up the ceiling, all the pillars\
  \ in the Sagrada Familia start off large at the base and gradually twist and taper\
  \ as they ascend. Before reaching their full height, they branch out in all directions.\
  \ The vaulted ceiling and branched pillars, along with the soft rainbow of light\
  \ coming through stained-glass windows, made me feel as if I were walking in a forest.\
  \ As I looked up the pillars, I noticed their shape constantly changing, just as\
  \ real trees appear to do. The openness of these limbs allows for natural light\
  \ to stream through skylights between the branches. \n\nI stared up in wonder, my\
  \ mouth hanging open. All around me crowds of people held the same wide-eyed, open-mouthed\
  \ sense of wonder. Many people dabbed at their eyes and wiped their noses with a\
  \ tissue, feeling the same emotion overwhelm in this cavernous space. Some embraced.\
  \ My eyes filled with tears as I let the emotion of this sacred space wash over\
  \ me. \n\n\u201CHey Mom, I know you love cathedrals, but this is a little over the\
  \ top,\u201D Tyler whispered. \n\n\u201CBasilica,\u201D I sniffled. I looked at\
  \ him and gave him a little smile.\n\n\u201CWhat\u2019s next?\u201D he asked.\n\n\
  \u201CWe still have to go up the tower and look at the view,\u201D I answered, wiping\
  \ away the tears.\n\nWe took an elevator up to the top of the Passion tower where,\
  \ at 250 feet up, we saw the progress of the construction from an aerial perspective\
  \ and looked out over the city of Barcelona, white buildings with red, tiled roofs\
  \ set against a brilliant blue sky, a mix of old and modern. I took a deep breath\
  \ and let the wonder of this place lift my spirits. \n\nMaybe Gaudi had something\
  \ when he envisioned a church with architecture that lent an invitation to prayer.\
  \ In this moment, it didn\u2019t really matter who or what I prayed to, but only\
  \ that I had a sense of something bigger than myself. \n\nTyler and I looked out\
  \ at the city below us. \u201CStill think this is just another cathedral?\u201D\
  \ I asked.\n\nHe was quiet for a moment and then said, \u201CI think I finally understand\
  \ your obsession.\u201D"
