Text: "Unlike most thailand university student, i didnot have a 6 month exchange in\
  \ a foreign country. Nor did i quit my job travel the world like so many travellers\
  \ bloggers and people i met on travels.\nI had a moment of realization while gliding\
  \ through the air on the flying fish in bali. This is the best felling ever! What\
  \ i havebeen missing out for the past 3 years? That was the first time i flew out\
  \ of thailand in 9 months, and first trip abroad with friends. A trip changed my\
  \ life. Before that last minute trip(we made the decision a day ago), i've neaver\
  \ given much thought to travelling. Since that the Bali trip in 2018 i have caught\
  \ the travel blug and been in and out of thailand two times. \nThe two craziest\
  \ of my life - strikking of item after item on my bucket list, meeting people from\
  \ all over the world and pushing myself out of my comfort zone trip, trip after\
  \ trip. I've jumped out of plane in india divided into a beautiful oceans, scaled\
  \ the volcano in india, took a bike ride above the Taj mahal. I've travelled in\
  \ solo multiple cities, travelled as aunt with my adorable nephews, travelled for\
  \ the first time with my aunt in 19 years. I've gotten lost, gotten robbed and gotten\
  \ sick. Been drunk on the streets. Starved till i couldn't speak. The freedom that\
  \ comes with exploration and living each day to the fullest. The felling of waking\
  \ up every single days exicted\nI took a hiatus from travel. Instead, i made sacrifices\
  \ in my studies and social life. As a type this on a plane ride from india to thailand,\
  \ i want people to to know that travel isnot limited to short, unfulfilled weekend\
  \ trips. I want people to know that is possible to live a life of your dreams. I\
  \ want people to knos that it is the matter of choices you make daily."
