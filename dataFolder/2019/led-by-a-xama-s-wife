Text: "Brazil is known for its paradise beaches in Rio de Janeiro, big cities like\
  \ S\xE3o Paulo, and Carnival. But what I realised was I had never been to every\
  \ corner of my country.  And so I booked my tickets to Amazonas.\nOnce I touched\
  \ the high altitude and the airplane flew over the state of Amazonas I could see\
  \ how much I would explore the uncharted territory of a land where I have been living\
  \ for over 25 years and neither my dad nor my mom has ever been here, nor any of\
  \ my friends, I knew nobody, I was on my own.  On the plane I grabbed my camera:\
  \ my journey was about to begin. Through the window I focused on a wide river running\
  \ among the trees, brown and dense, it was not very fast though, it was flowing\
  \ smoothy and gracefully, the rainforest showed me big canopies, shades of green\
  \ composed by different dimensions of leaves, warm colours among them, it was alive,\
  \ my mind ran fast I noticed there were people calling it home. \nTo reach Amazona\u2019\
  s indigenous community was only possible by a boat trip which takes 50 minutes from\
  \ Manaus harbour. On the water I could feel the breeze of the new adventure which\
  \ was about to come.\nAnd as far as we got from the port I was able to see the Meetings\
  \ of Waters: two rivers, two different colors, two different densities, two different\
  \ temperatures, over than 90 species of fishes have been found out there. The Negro\
  \ River which is born in Columbia has a dark coloration due to the decomposition\
  \ of leaves; Solim\xF5es River is born in the Peruvian Andes and its brown appearance\
  \ is attributed to the minerals from the mountains. Our boat approaches and plays\
  \ between the boundaries, sewing the waters, effortless, there is no change, the\
  \ waters are still apart from each other and they keep asunder along the horizon\
  \ for the next 11 kilometers. Arriving in the village we were led by the xam\xE3\
  \u2019s wife, her funny Portuguese told us it was not her first language, a topless\
  \ middle aged lady wearing a grass skirt, getting to feel Amazonas nice weather,\
  \ I felt like taking my shirt off, however I held myself. \nShe drove us through\
  \ the land, our first stop was a wide saloon roofed by different leaves where we\
  \ sat down and watched our Welcome ceremony. The natives danced for us offering\
  \ all the beauty of their traditions, synchronised movements and rattles attached\
  \ to their feet, sometimes in circles and other times calling us from the audience\
  \ to be part of the festivities, a man stared me in the eyes and stood in front\
  \ of me, with a smile he grabbed my hand, in a few seconds I was there, in a man\u2019\
  s arms. A man who has lived his whole life in an indigenous community in Amazonas,\
  \ who has never experienced crazy traffic jams, missed buses, been late to work,\
  \ the purity of his smile made me smile, I danced as I had never done it before,\
  \ people clapping hands, celebrating. The energy took over the place. Playing a\
  \ type of harmonica, drums and more rattles, but this time by hands, all instrument\
  \ made by them, echoing in the space, echoing in my heart, blowing my mind. The\
  \ ceremony is over and there are some ants and fish for us to try, smoked on a rudimentary\
  \ stove made of rocks and firewood, there is also a young lady painting some indigenous\
  \ symbols on whoever wants it, I got a beautiful framed painting that represents\
  \ earth's fertility, mixed with red and black ink which later has become a real\
  \ tattoo on my left arm.  \nBeing in a place filled with topless girls with no mobile\
  \ phones to selfie their breasts was the kind of experience my S\xE3o Paulo\u2019\
  s roots would never give to me. Everything seems so genuine, the huts were built\
  \ at the exact height due to the flooding of the river, hammocks hanging comfortably\
  \ inviting us to take a nap in that long sunny afternoon, although the invitation\
  \ was irresistible it was time to proceed our journey to the next stop."
