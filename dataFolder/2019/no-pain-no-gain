Text: 'Me and my childhood friend woke up 2.50 am to trekking to mountain batur in
  Bali. So, we were 4 person in one group.our guide was guiding us to trekking till
  mountain Batur.We were so excited and walking continuous...but never know it''s
  not easy and never know  It will take time 2 hrs to go up but we both have no experience
  actually how far is this. And while trekking we were just omg why we come here?And
  scolding the friend of mine who suggested us for this trekking. I almost started
  cry pls let me get down. This experience only those who will know or who did this
  mountain batur trekking. After 2 and half hours trekking we saw the sun rise which
  is the best sunrise in the world. We were lucky enough. This journey is unforgettable.
  I was just surprise 5 hours trekking with that kind of mountain how we did. Everything
  is possible. Slowly but surely. So the last advice is please for travelling need
  enough energy,confident. We saw few old lady also trekked mountain batur. Trekking
  mountain Batur is worth decision to see the most beautiful sunrise ever. No pain
  no gain. So after sunrise enjoying the scenery we came down and after that amazing
  trekking .We had 3 days leg pain .We could not do anything ....spa massage nothings
  works with us........

  The most amazing trekking with childhood friends is unforgettable memory.

  Travellers never die.'
