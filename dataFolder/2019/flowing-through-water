Text: 'It was the rafting in Zanskar river in Leh.It was all going fine.Went through
  rapids,fought with it and then we were again ready to fight with the rapid and all
  of a sudden,rafter flipped and we all went along the waves of nature.4people were
  near the rafter so they got back in 30seconds , rest flowing somewhere, floating,
  along the rapid without rafter, omg that was just terrific.Still I remember the
  thing jiju was beside me.He helped me out, water was chilling. I was screaming please
  take me near to stone edges as again I saw the rapid near to me.I was so terrified.We
  couldnt go along the stone edges due to flow of water.And again met rapid.Then,I
  was so scared.Jiju was just guiding me to float up.But I was almost done with my
  energy.Still I was willing to float and stay above.Jiju was screaming for help help
  but there was no one around us.Then kayaking guy came after 8-9minutes.I got hung
  myself with kayaking boat.And then he went at the stone edge.and I got almost unconscious.but
  still conscious.then I came to know even my shoe was lost somewhere.I was freezing
  there, shivering, then after 5minutes of rest and breathe,we started again.Each
  one had his/her different story.But none was as terrific as this one as I and jiju
  were rescued second last. This rescue went on till 10minutes.And kayaking guy said
  if it went to 20minutes,then the person becomes unconscious.

  I was shivering too much.tried to paddle but back n neck was paining due to cold.I
  was really willing to complete 28kms bt body didnt help me.Almost after 1 and half
  hr,My body stopped shivering and came back to normal after changing clothes,vicks,jacket,cotton,etc.'
