Text: "When I first read about Marrakech, I was thrilled and ever since I wanted to\
  \ come, that was six years ago. \nI\u2019m currently 19, I didn\u2019t think though\
  \ what I was doing when I went out my house\u2019 s door with just a backpacking\
  \ bag, at firs I was having second thoughts about it and almost backed off but then,\
  \ all I thought about was my mother and the miserable life I had with her, ever\
  \ since she split up with my father, everything became so monotonous and a day couldn\u2019\
  t go by without us fighting and yelling at each other, I surely wanted to go to\
  \ college and finish a career but the fact that my mother was constantly pushing\
  \ me and comparing myself with very other successful girl she knew, so I got tired\
  \ of that, all I knew was that I had to get away, I had to run, it was for my own\
  \ good, so I made the decision to buy a ticket, a ticket to a faraway land and Middle\
  \ East was just the place for me.\nMy grandparents gave me some money to survive\
  \ until I found a job and could sustain myself, I was deadly scared when I arrived,\
  \ the first thing I did as I arrived was to look for a really cheap hotel, then\
  \ I started walking around looking for a cafe to work at to start, I found a lovely\
  \ one with a sort of gothic style, the owner was a French fourty year old lady,\
  \ she was gorgeus, kind and treated me so well, her name was Charlotte and she had\
  \ been living in Marrakech for five years, she had a twenty year old son who was\
  \ living in Canada and came to visit her every summer, she also had a twelve year\
  \ old daughter who was living in France with her father and his new wife, she used\
  \ to spend every holiday with her but this year she wasn\u2019t gonna make it. \n\
  After the first month in Marrakech, I started feeling like home, so free, so happy,\
  \ so me, every night I talked for a while with my grandparents, my mother was still\
  \ furious and my father didn\u2019t want to talk to me until I started college.\
  \ Nevertheless, I felt proud of myself for trying something new and for fighting\
  \ against my fears, everything was just fine I life and I felt complete. \nThat\
  \ summer, Eduard Lef\xE8vre, came to visit Charlie and he was a complete asshole,\
  \ he was so arrogant and proud, Charlie made him walk me home every night after\
  \ work but we just couldn\u2019t bond. One of those nights, some guy started following\
  \ us and he ended up sleeping at my place, after that day we went everywhere together,\
  \ when the summer ended, he had to live and everything turned complicated again,\
  \ the last day of summer, he made me a proposal and I said yes.\nI\u2019m currently\
  \ on my last year of college in Canada and this summer we\u2019re going to Marrakech\
  \ to visit Charlie. \nAt the end, everything turned out just great."
