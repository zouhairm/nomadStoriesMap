Text: "As the crowd at my holiday work party grew silent to hear the next round of\
  \ raffle winners...standing in the back, I took a small bite of my appetizer and\
  \ faintly heard...\"Chenea Gordon, you've won two tickets to Paris courtesy of Lufthansa\
  \ airlines!!\" \"I must be hearing things,\" I thought as I stood there frozen,\
  \ appetizer still in hand. As I heard my name repeated, I proceeded breathlessly\
  \ toward the stage, too excited to properly lift my long velvet dress as it dragged\
  \ the floor, my appetizer with it. My boyfriend (at the time) and I agreed to use\
  \ the tickets to spend my birthday weekend in Paris. Since my birthday always lands\
  \ on or around Thanksgiving Day, we decided to travel the weekend before the holiday\
  \ in order to be back in time with our families. Fast forward to November 13th,\
  \ 2015, as the people of Paris fell victim to a series of deadly attacks carried\
  \ out by the terrorist organization, ISIS. These attacks took the lives of at least\
  \ 130 people, wounded over 400 and led to the French government to temporarily close\
  \ its borders. \nI watched from my living room in Queens, New York, horrified for\
  \ those affected and scared to travel as our flight was scheduled to depart 4 days\
  \ after these attacks took place. Every social media outlet exploded in support\
  \ of Paris with hashtags such as #JesuisParis (I am Paris) and #PrayforParis. However,\
  \ after discussing my travel plans and fears with my parents and my boyfriend's\
  \ parents, we still decided to go. \nThe day of our flight, the French border had\
  \ already been reopened for a few days and flights continued as normal. Coming from\
  \ an airline and travel agent background, I am not usually uneasy on flights, but\
  \ due to recent events, everything made me jumpy. Fortunately, Lufthansa Airlines\
  \ has amazing customer service and it was a very comfortable, safe flight to Charles\
  \ de Gaulle Airport. I had arranged for us to stay in a spacious one bedroom Airbnb\
  \ for four nights in the 17th arrondissement and was anxious to connect with our\
  \ host once we cleared customs. Two hours later we were in the heart of Paris, in\
  \ our Airbnb discussing our plans for the next few days with our host. Originally\
  \ from Cameroon, Jean spoke fluent French and English and was very friendly. We\
  \ instantly made a connection with him and felt comfortable enough to ask how people\
  \ were recovering from the recent attacks. Jean plainly said, \"you know, life moves\
  \ on, it has to. Parisians are resilient. We won't move through our lives in fear.\"\
  \  \nAs our trip continued, we noticed that Jean's words rang true. Although security\
  \ around the city had increased and we would occasionally see four-men police squads\
  \ marching through train stations and neighborhoods, from my perspective Paris was\
  \ not reminiscent of a city riddled in fear and mistrust. Instead, the people were\
  \ warm, welcoming and living life busily. The rest of our days were filled with\
  \ losing ourselves in the contrasting pathways of Parisian streets, whilst spending\
  \ our nights bewitched by the dazzling lights on Avenue des Champs-\xC9lys\xE9es.\
  \ The spirit of the city is in its people just as much as it is in the dancing lights\
  \ of the Eiffel tower or the delicious French cuisine. I flew back home feeling\
  \ inspired to keep that resiliency alive in my own life and when observing current\
  \ events in and around the world. I am thankful to Paris for the surprisingly powerful\
  \ experience and thankful to Jean for the gentle reminder."
