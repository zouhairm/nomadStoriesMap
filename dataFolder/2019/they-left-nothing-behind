Text: "One may like very much La Havana, but even the most fanatical must admit that,\
  \ with its own rhythm and style, it is a city that does not breathe. After a few\
  \ days of walking around its streets and feeling tired of its tourists and vehicular\
  \ gases, I decided to escape from its dissipation, from its jineteros and from the\
  \ ubiquitous reggaeton that today invades their nights and days.\n\nThrough a long\
  \ day and an endless night of traveling, when I got off the bus in Baracoa, the\
  \ first Spanish settlement in Cuba, I engaged in casual conversation with a Brazilian\
  \ man. His name was Mota and, as he told me, he was making a photography book about\
  \ \u201Cthe last days of Cuba\u201D as we knew it. Baracoa would be the final step\
  \ of his two months trip around the country. His goal was to arrive at Mais\xED\
  , the most oriental town of the island, about 60 kilometers southeast. He invited\
  \ me to join him.\n\nI didn't know him and I didn't know Cuba, but if those were\
  \ going to be its last days, I wanted to be there.\n\nAfter some negotiations, we\
  \ found a smiling driver willing to take us. Through the window of his old Soviet\
  \ car, we admired the generous tropical landscape of the Guantanamo province. But\
  \ also we saw its most devastating aspect: once in a while, you could watch the\
  \ violent effects of Hurricane Matthew, who had passed over the region a few months\
  \ before.\n\nWhen we were leaving the last semi-destroyed hamlet behind, I could\
  \ glimpse the aim of our trip, the lighthouse of Mais\xED. But we discovered that\
  \ the place was not a big deal. Mota was visibly disappointed but devoted himself\
  \ to taking some photographs, certainly not very striking.\n\nI suggested that we\
  \ could walk by the coastline towards some buildings that appear to be within walking\
  \ distance. We arrived at an esplanade with three large sheds whose roofs had flown\
  \ with the hurricane. There was another building, smaller but in better condition.\
  \ Mota began to photograph everything but suddenly three soldiers appeared shouting\
  \ that we must not be there.\n\nIt could have been a very tense situation, however,\
  \ the tone that they used was as friendly as any other Cuban's. That place was,\
  \ as the officer in charge told me, a concentration camp for illegal Haitian immigrants.\
  \ The sheds were empty at that time, except for rows of rusted bunk beds, but they\
  \ had sheltered more than a thousand people.\n\nWe returned to Baracoa. Upon arriving\
  \ at the place where I was staying, my casa particular, I fell into a deep sleep.\
  \ In dreams, the lighthouse of Mais\xED appeared to me in the middle of a violent\
  \ storm, lighting in all directions with frenzy. Occasionally, its beam of light\
  \ fell over unknown faces with deep and resilient eyes. It was like one of those\
  \ old movies where we could see crowded and frightened people in the holds of old\
  \ ships crossing an inclement tempest.\n\nIn the afternoon at Mais\xED, I was struck\
  \ by the fact that the sheds' walls were free of any kind of human mark. Those places\
  \ had been full of people who had faced the unspeakable in the sea with a futile\
  \ hope of a better life. Nevertheless, they left nothing behind, not even a trace.\n\
  \nIn my dream, instead, those walls were cramped with messages."
