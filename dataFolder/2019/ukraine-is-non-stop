Text: "The sense of time and space leaves you completely after 15 hours on an overnight\
  \ train to Kiev, sharing vodka with fellow passengers who do not speak your language,\
  \ and barely sleeping more than a few hours. Only a few hours into our trip we turned\
  \ new men, creatures more tired and opened to everything, in a new world with new\
  \ rules that never stops and never sleeps.\nAround 1 AM we ran out of vodka, still\
  \ with many more hours to final destination. Thomas left the compartment to speak\
  \ to the train conductor, leaving John and I with our new friend Laszlo, a 50-something\
  \ year old business man, who was going on and on about brain energies. John apparently\
  \ had the strongest brain energy out of all of us, which was fine by me, because\
  \ I was in close second.\nThomas was gone for a long while, Laszlo called it quits\
  \ and fell asleep on one of the top bunks. Thomas returned after a short while with\
  \ a secretive smile. The conductor popped in soon after, handed us a bottle wrapped\
  \ in newspaper and left.\n\u201CHow much did it cost?\u201D we asked Thomas.\n\u201C\
  200 hryvnia (6 \u20AC)!\u201D he replied and unscrewed the top.\n***\nPrices like\
  \ this followed us for the rest of the week. Room for 5 \u20AC per night per person.\
  \ Same price for a dinner of gargantuan proportions. Cigarettes for 1 \u20AC. Bribing\
  \ three policemen: 10 \u20AC.\nWe lived like kings. Or rather like tourists, it\u2019\
  s up to you.\nAnd just like proper tourists we also booked a trip to Chernobyl.\n\
  ***\nOur guide, Sergey, picked us up with a minibus at the Kiev main station at\
  \ 8 AM sharp. Us and like 15 other British tourists who apparently spent the previous\
  \ night drinking, because we had to stop on the side of the road a few times for\
  \ them to puke.\nIn less then two hours we reached the first checkpoint of the Chernobyl\
  \ Exclusion Zone. Then the second one. It\u2019s hard to describe exactly, but once\
  \ you step outside of the bus inside the Zone, you feel like the air is heavier.\
  \ It isn\u2019t, in fact, spending a day in the Zone exposes you less radiation\
  \ then just on X-Ray, but you still feel the heaviness of the place and of its history.\n\
  Walking in the forest that used to be a town fills you with immense sadness for\
  \ all the lives that were lost in the initial explosion and in preventing an even\
  \ larger second one. You are in awe of the bravery of those firemen and volunteers\
  \ who knowingly chose death by radiation, so that many more millions could live.\n\
  At the same time, though, it is all so freaking cool. The nature taking over the\
  \ abandoned houses and streets. The main square now reduced to a meadow surrounded\
  \ by tall trees blowing in the wind. The radioactive dogs who are in fact not radioactive\
  \ and you can safely pet them. The massive sarcophagus covering the site of the\
  \ explosion. The whole freaking thing.\n***\nSergey said that drinking large amounts\
  \ of alcohol can mitigate the effects of radiation, so in the evening we ended up\
  \ in a bar called Banka, somewhere on the edge of the city centre. There we ordered\
  \ a traditional (read: touristy) drink called The Chime of Bells. The bartender\
  \ pours you 12 shots of vodka, gives you a worker\u2019s helmet, pulls out a whistle\
  \ and the procedure can begin. He blows the whistle, picks up a shot, hits you on\
  \ the helmet with it and only then can you drink it. Repeat 12 times. And the final\
  \ chaser? Champagne, stirred so that it froths in your mouth.\nAnd afterwards, because\
  \ this is Kiev and Kiev is non-stop, you stay in the bar, have a few more rounds,\
  \ talk with beautiful Ukrainian girls, leave at closing time only to find a non-stop\
  \ corner shop and continue drinking into the wee hours of the morning. Because this\
  \ is Ukraine. There is not stopping, there are no rules and there are no excuses."
