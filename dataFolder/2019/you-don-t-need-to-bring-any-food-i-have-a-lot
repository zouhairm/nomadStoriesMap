Text: "Prague, January 5, 2016\n\n\u201CMaryanna, I hope that you are enjoying Prague\
  \ and that you will find my place easily. You don't need to bring any food, I have\
  \ a lot for me and you.\u201D (Host number 12)\n\nThe story begins like this: Maryanna\
  \ decides to go to Prague from one day to the next. Maryanna makes a post in the\
  \ emergency Couchsurfing group and begins receiving zillions of messages from stupid\
  \ men who invited her to stay over \u2014 in the same bed, by the way. Maryanna\
  \ choosed the one that had about 100 references and no blatant trait of machismo\
  \ or second intentions in the invitation.\n\nMaryanna chose her twelfth host and\
  \ arrived there at 7:30 p.m., after a long walking tour in the sunny (disappointing\
  \ winter) Prague. The 116 bus has reached its destination. The destination was in\
  \ the middle of the nothing. Each house was 200m away from each other. Friends,\
  \ the girl in the blue backpack had a deep breath and went on to find the address\
  \ \u0160\xE1reck\xE9m \xFAdol\xED 54/96. The host wished it were easy to find his\
  \ house because he knew it would be difficult. And it was. After many laps, I was\
  \ entering through a rusty blue gate.\n\nI entered, sat down, and instinctively\
  \ asked: \u201CDo you have wifi here?\u201D. I didn't want to check my Instagram,\
  \ I just wanted to send my location to my mother in case of an emergency. Maryanna\
  \ was alone, in the middle of nowhere, with an unknown man who said without regret:\
  \ \"There is no internet.\" My pupil dilated and only returned to normal when two\
  \ elements appeared on the scene: a dog (TouchWood) and a cat (no name). I hugged\
  \ my new friends and thought, \"Stay close to me, I'm afraid.\" And they did not\
  \ leave. I had cat hair for months in my pajamas.\n\nThe evening went on normally:\
  \ we ate a warm soup and some moldy bread (keep this information) and he invited\
  \ me to a party. I went ... because I wanted to get away from there. The party was\
  \ incredibly bizarre and I loved it. They celebrated the 100th anniversary of Dadaism.\
  \ We left at 2am and he said we would have to walk on a footpath, but before that,\
  \ we would go to the supermarket.\n\nIf you have read this far, congratulations,\
  \ this is the climax.\n\nWe went to the supermarket. Outside. In the shed ... To\
  \ pick up \"trash\".\nMy host number 12 went into a huge trash can at 2 o'clock\
  \ in the morning and I did not understand what was happening. Until he takes a lot,\
  \ a lot, a lot of food from inside, enough to fill three boxes and a backpack. At\
  \ that moment the soup and the moldy bread rolled in my stomach and greeted the\
  \ newly rescued brothers. At that moment the phrase \"... You did not need to bring\
  \ any food, I have a lot\" echoed in my ears.\n\nThe embarrassment of someone who\
  \ was breaking an infamous paradigm over garbage pickers was cut off when host number\
  \ 12 took two bouquets of flowers, roses and yellows out of the basket. The symbolism\
  \ of it was so intense that I joined the man and together we made a fair of cherry,\
  \ banana, cucumber, yogurt, biscuits, moldy bread ... and flowers.\n\nAll my ignorant\
  \ fear melted away like a magic spell, and for fifteen minutes we passed through\
  \ a little moonlit forest, singing a song with wooden boxes on my head. We arrived\
  \ at the house (which I discovered was invaded) and I slept as tight as I had not\
  \ for days."
