Text: "BOLIVIA. Never a word made me cry so much. Don\u2019t get me wrong, it\u2019\
  s a beautiful country that I learned to love and care about but for the ten year\
  \ old me, it was horrifying. I had no idea where or what it was, but I didn\u2019\
  t care. The tears just kept falling down my face. Moving to another country, leaving\
  \ everything I knew and loved behind was too much for me but I didn\u2019t have\
  \ a choice. \n\nLeaving the airport, looking through the car\u2019s window I remember\
  \ being surprise. Everything was different but at the same time quite alike. I felt\
  \ I was in a parallel universe, not in another country.\n \nThe first person I met\
  \ was our housekeeper, Maria. We couldn\u2019t understand each other very well but\
  \ I liked her. She was indigenous and very different from the majority of people\
  \ I saw in the street. She used a lot of baggy clothes and long skirts with vibrant\
  \ colors. But the thing I most admired about her was her hair. She had beautiful\
  \ black her that was so long, it touch the ground. Every single morning she would\
  \ make a massive bun and then cover it with a fabric. I never understood why she\
  \ would cover such a beautiful hair. She was never able to explain it to me. All\
  \ I knew was that I wanted hair just like that, but I would never hide it, I would\
  \ want the world to see. \n\nMaria was quite young, maybe twenty or so, and didn\u2019\
  t seem to be accustomed to the \u201Cbig\u201D city. I still feel pretty guilty\
  \ about the day I made fun of her because she didn\u2019t know how to make instant\
  \ noodles. She hadn\u2019t even tasted it, and for me, that was absurd. At the time,\
  \ I wasn\u2019t aware how different our lives were and how the gap between rich\
  \ and poor was wide. \n\nAside from her and the fact that the city didn\u2019t have\
  \ a mall; everything else was similar to my country.  Quickly, I created my new\
  \ little world, and I was blinded to everything besides my school and friends. \
  \ It was all like it was back home. \n\nWhat finally opened my eyes was when Maria\
  \ had to leave and another Maria came into my live. She had a daughter around my\
  \ age that would come to my house everyday. I never question her about her life,\
  \ we would just watch TV, play with my dog or whatever.  She and her mom became\
  \ a huge part of my life. Once, I was going to travel with my family and Maria offered\
  \ to take care of my dog. So, my mom and I went to her house to leave the dog there.\
  \ \nWhen I saw her house, a mix of feelings came rushing through me. I was so surprised,\
  \ sad and horrified that people lived in those conditions. It took everything I\
  \ had not to cry. I couldn\u2019t let them see me cry because of where they lived.\
  \ The house was located in a big green field. The neighbors were really far away,\
  \ it was kind of scary. The house was basically a concrete box. There were no windows\
  \ or doors, just holes. There was just one room for four people with almost nothing\
  \ inside. I was never so ashamed in my life. As soon as I entered my car, I started\
  \ crying so much I couldn\u2019t stop. I didn\u2019t understand how they could be\
  \ so happy all the time around me, be so nice with me when I had so much. I don\u2019\
  t think I would be able to do it. \n\nThat day changed my life completely. It was\
  \ when I finally understood the world, how terrible and unfair it is.  But also,\
  \ the day I began to admire people for how strong and determinated they are to survive\
  \ while living life to the fullest, not letting obstacles stop them."
