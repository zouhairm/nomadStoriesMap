Text: 'Tio Gong Tau represent ancient knowledge of Black Magic in South Asia, where
  spirits and ghouls are not only family protectors but also magicians servants; the
  power of ancient traditions lay in the Island.

  Singapura is a syncretism of cultures and a meeting of global markets. A short sentence
  to describe a city-state that brings managers dreams on the heights of skyscrapers.
  But if for a moment we move away from the buzz of the offices and the streets more
  beaten by visitors we can encounter temples less than that of the "Buddha''s Tooth"
  of South Bridge Road, but equally important. For each block, there are at least
  one small temple resounding spells "to make a lot of money" and the silences of
  some old man with falling cataracts: a mix of colors and religious folklore, an
  initiatory path that sees the passage from the new temples of the god Money (the
  skyscrapers) and the Ancient ones; a perfect syncretism between the Eastern and
  Western canons.

  Streets are full of corners with offerings, candles, and incense, the joss papers
  are burned on the streets in tall containers, spells for the ancestors. Tao mediumistic
  performances revive religious nights in Pasir Panjang and Malay Bomohs can be book
  online for spiritual services.

  All the ancestry beliefs from neighbour countries mixed and evolved in the Lion
  City.'
