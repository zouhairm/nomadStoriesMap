Text: "Well, I really don't know how to start because what what happened to me was\
  \ crazy. In my last vacation, I traveled with my aunt, my uncle and my sister.\n\
  I study archaeology and my aunt is archaeologist, so our dream was to get to know\
  \ Egypt and all the mysticity that attracted us so much. Egypt is the reason why\
  \ I decided to study archeology. And I could not believe that finally I would go\
  \ to Egypt. It was my first flight, my first trip by train, my first cruise trip.\
  \ I remembered that I have the ticket flight, but I still could not believe it.\n\
  We had a stopover in Colombia, Bogot\xE1. We arrived at 8:00 a.m. approximately\
  \ and our next flight was at 10 p.m. so we decided get a tour for all day. A taxi\
  \ driver took us to the \"Catedral de Sal\" it's like a subterranean mine. And we\
  \ were amazed to know something like that. Then we go to the Botero's museum and\
  \ the day ended. Then we go to Madrid to get the flight to Cairo Egypt. And the\
  \ moment that in which I breathed that air, I almost cry. I remembered that we arrived\
  \ around 4 a.m. a person was waiting for us to get us to our hotel. Our hotel was\
  \ in Giza, we didn't see anything that night because everything was dark. I couldn't\
  \ sleep because I was so excited. The first day we went to the pyramids and I really\
  \ cried. I feel that nothing in this world would surpass that. After that day I\
  \ felt I could die in piece because my dream became reality. The next days we went\
  \ to museums, and the guide told us the story of the pharaohs and mythology. I was\
  \ the happiest person in the whole world. Then we flight to Answan to get the cruise\
  \ to Luxor. Our days was the best, we ended the days tired because we enjoyed every\
  \ minute. We went to many temples on the roads, we also had a guide for each place.\
  \ We felt the energy in the temples and we tried to connect with the places. Some\
  \ temples was really crowd and we can't appreciate like we would like. Then we stayed\
  \ in a hotel in Luxor because that was the capital of the country in ancient Egypt,\
  \ so there's many temples, many museums, many places to visit. We went to Karnak,\
  \ to the Valley of the Kings, to the Tutankamon tomb, to the Hatchepsut temple,\
  \ to Abydos and that was the temple that we surprised and really connect with the\
  \ place. I can't explain what we felt, but we stayed in silence looking the Osiris's\
  \ tomb around for a long time. The temple was almost empty and we appreciate better\
  \ than ever.\nTalking about the people was so kind and friendly, we felt different\
  \ tastes, different smells.\nAt the end of the trip we had a mystical experience\
  \ because like the pharaohs we went to subterranean earth (in Colombia) and then\
  \ we will make extraordinary things in our life to get the eternity life. It's better\
  \ than I can explain with words, but that is the idea.\nThen we traveled by sleeping\
  \ train from Luxor to Cairo to get the flight to our home with another perspective,\
  \ another vibes and another dreams."
