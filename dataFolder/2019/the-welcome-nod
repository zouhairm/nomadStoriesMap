Text: "I gripped the ticket firmly in my hand and tried to follow the steward's eyes\
  \ as it skirted the paper. India had very unique methods of organization, and my\
  \ best methods of coping included standing like a lost child. I pushed my head down\
  \ against the sounds and tried to understand. \n\nWhich carriage was that? No, that\
  \ one here. The worn steel moaned beneath the weight of its too-many passengers\
  \ while a smell of sewage wafted up and mixed unsympathetically with aromas from\
  \ the curry stalls. I'm fairly certain I booked a sleeper bunk, I gently argued\
  \ while my stomach turned.\n\nHe nodded to avoid the confusion of language, then\
  \ led me down the tracks to a similar carriage and pointed inside. \n\nAs soon as\
  \ I was on, I thought to hop off quickly and triple check things, but the steward\
  \ had already disappeared and the crowd surged forward, closing off my exit. The\
  \ only thing left was to crawl to the next soul that would pity me. There is a look\
  \ travelers wear, one that you thought was a smile, and it reads so easily as a\
  \ plea for help to more permanent beings. Maybe it was the wide-eyed wonder at the\
  \ amount of bodies that fit into so narrow a space; perhaps it was my mouth agape\
  \ with shock at the realization that the air-con was absent, and in their place\
  \ were fans from my grandparent's generation. Maybe it was the trickling understanding\
  \ of the fourteen hours that lay ahead. Maybe I was smiling less than I thought.\n\
  \nSeveral responded to my look, glanced at my ticket for only a second and then\
  \ smiled and nodded affirmatively. I asked specifics and was given the iconic Indian\
  \ head nod, more like a side-to-side bobble, whose meaning remains a mystery to\
  \ me. At no particular time the train pulled away, and there was no more use in\
  \ asking such questions. I finally settled into a corner side bench feeling like\
  \ a minnow swallowed alive by a much larger fish.\n\nThe train rattled on. Unfamiliar\
  \ names could be heard as the \u201Cstops\u201D, in true Indian fashion, would slow\
  \ the train just enough to exchange passengers before picking up speed again. At\
  \ each one, I couldn't help tensing and rereading the phonetics I had written down.\
  \ Despite having a time frame, I was deeply aware of how misplaced I was.\n\nI became\
  \ aware of a pair of glittering eyes staring at me. A face lit the hallway between\
  \ me and her, staring like only a child can stare, without shame or judgment. She\
  \ was small, maybe no older than five, with great big brown eyes framed by chubby\
  \ cheeks. She wore a red spotted scarf around her head like a Russian grandmother,\
  \ and her curly brown hair tumbled out from underneath it. \n\nOur eyes connected,\
  \ and she smiled. I smiled, made faces, and nodded playfully. She returned an exaggerated\
  \ attempt at the foreigner-style nod and giggled to herself. The family noticed\
  \ and encouraged the distraction. She nodded again, and I was obliged to return\
  \ it. Back and forth the nod went, until it grew into a caricature and she was in\
  \ fits of laughter. And then I was saved.\n\nThe family introduced themselves, offered\
  \ me what little food they had, and confirmed my journey. Theirs was only one stop\
  \ before mine, and they promised to remind me when they said goodbye. We spoke about\
  \ the money crisis, politics, and the weather, of the idiosyncrasies of culture.\
  \ The sister, who spoke perfect English, was getting married soon. The mother doted\
  \ on the babuskha-child. The brother worried about his job. I recognized it all-\
  \ it was yours, mine, and every family. They demonstrated the sleeping bunks to\
  \ me, tucked my pack among their own belongings, and insisted I rest. A fourteen\
  \ hour journey stretched into eighteen, but for all my sore joints and tired steps\
  \ afterwards, I always remembered that small gesture, the welcome nod."
