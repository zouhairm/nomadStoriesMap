  \ place of Oman where every year rain falls and makes climate cool breeze. Basically\
  \ Salalah is a type of greenery lush mountainous area like Muree area of Pakistan.\
  \ Capital of Oman is Muscat. I love lot Oman as I visited by my family and saw Muscat\
  \ and Oman. I experience many places of Oman and Muscat. Whole \nOman city is very\
