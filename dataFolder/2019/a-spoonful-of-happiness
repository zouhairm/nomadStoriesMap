Text: "I decided to take this trip alone without knowing anyone in this unknown place\
  \ and all I wanted was for life to surprise me . So I reached India\u2019s commercial\
  \ capital Mumbai and directly went to Novotel Juhu near to a popular tourist point\
  \ Juhu Chowpatty and slept straight for 6 hours due to jet lag . \nThings are wanted\
  \ to explore in Mumbai were written down on my notepad in phone and the first thing\
  \ I wanted to do was spent the night gazing at the stars in Marine Drive. Now Marine\
  \ Drive also known as Queen\u2019s necklace can be spotted by you from your flight\
  \ as you are almost about to land but it\u2019s a must visit place if you really\
  \ want to experience the beauty and serenity of marines , you can hear the water\
  \ splashing against the shore but still find that calmness within yourself . \n\n\
  Next stop early morning was Gateway of India. I googled all these places I wanted\
  \ to visit and really wanted those classic pictures with me laughing freely Gateway\
  \ in the background and pigeons flying away as I jump into the air and yes I did\
  \ get a ton of pictures from Gateway with the same setup I had in my mind.\nI also\
  \ spotted hundreds of people waiting to board their ferries for Alibagh, a distant\
  \ place from Main Mumbai also now famous for beach parties. \n\nAfter Gateway ,\
  \ I went to Colaba Causeway to shop for antiques and God ! I did not know it was\
  \ a flea market too what a rush but so much fun to see shopkeepers selling those\
  \ beautiful accessories at such less rates . I bought a handful of accessories and\
  \ diaries from Colaba .\n\n\n\nAt night I went to juhu beach well it\u2019s wasn\u2019\
  t like any other beach I have ever been too. It was a bit crowded and had couples\
  \ spending their time with mouth watering smells from the chowpatty where authentic\
  \ mumbai food pav bhaji and vada pav were best sellers .\n\n\nGod ! I ate a lot\
  \ but at the end I loved and cherish the experience of it all . Can\u2019t wait\
  \ to see you soon Mumbai! Xoxo"
