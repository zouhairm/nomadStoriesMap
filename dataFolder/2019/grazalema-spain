Text: "I live outside of Sevilla in a flat river valley. I became friends with the\
  \ local proprietor of my neighborhood bar who told me about a beautiful part of\
  \ Andalucia that was so much different than the Guadalquivir River where I lived.\
  \   This local bartender and his wife offered to drive me to the mountains of Cadiz.\
  \  We drove directly southeast and in two hours  we were in a part of Cadiz with\
  \ jagged peaks, azure lakes, kite flying and outlaw caves full of memorabilia. \
  \ The air was fresh and clean and the jaw dropping views make you linger at every\
  \ stop.  Passing the village of Zahara  there is a long turquoise blue resevoir,\
  \ with kayaks and a nice cafe overlooking the dam.  \n\nGrazalema is noted by many\
  \ Spaniards as the perfect place to train as a cyclist.  Many cycling athletes stay\
  \ for a week and train on the steep roads and curving roads.  They call it the little\
  \ \"Pyrenees\".  We cautiously passed many brave cyclists sweating up the hills.\
  \ \nThis part of Andalucia has the most rainfall.  Our winding roads were lined\
  \ with ferns, and dripping moss. The best part of the trip after lunch in the main\
  \ plaza of Grazalema was the appearance of a family of wild, horned, tawny goats,\
  \ jumping along the ridge crest near our van.  When we looked directly north from\
  \ our perch in town we could see Ronda in the distance.  These are fairly well known\
  \ destinies on the road called  the Pueblos Blancos.  \nIf you like castles, and\
  \ picturesque villages this is a step back in time.  The moors tried to capture\
  \ these towns but  the steep cliffs kept them from capturing the settlements  and\
  \ they could not enter the towns.   Oil paintings in the chapel of Zahara depict\
  \ the Moorish threat defeated by the Christians.\n \nOn the way back to Sevilla\
  \ we passed the road to UTRERA, a very famous flamenco town.   This entire day trip\
  \ was inexpensive and lasted 7 hours.\nWe were out of city traffic and pollution.\
  \ The quiet beauty of the white villages with flowers cascading down their walls\
  \ was a comforting change\nto Cathedral gazing.  These towns are known for their\
  \ hand crafted wool blankets from the local sheep.  There is also a huge furniture\
  \ workshop in the town of Bosque where they build tables and chairs out of local\
  \ wood and sell them to the public.\n\nIf we had kept driving south an hour later\
  \ we would have reached the famous city of JEREZ, which is just 20 minutes from\
  \ Cadiz.\nIt has a train station, beautiful beaches, gigantic cathedral,  a fort,\
  \ malecon and botanical gardens right near one of the most luxurious PARADORS in\
  \ Spain.  If you can't make it to Havana, Cuba, this is a very close version of\
  \ the malecon in Cuba.  It also resembles Cartagena, Columbia.\nThere is enough\
  \ pirate lore here to fill many books, and the people have a celebration of Chiringote\
  \ songs to teach about that every February.\n\nJust as you leave Cadiz, which is\
  \ actually an island connected to the land by a highway, you pass flocks of pink\
  \ and black flamingos.\nThese birds are not here in the winter, as they fly to Africa,\
  \ but the rest of the time they are quite visible from the highway.\n\nWhile driving\
  \ west on the highway towards Barbate you will pass a tuna museum and the town of\
  \ VEJER de la Frontera, perched on a giant hill like a mini Ronda.  The amazing\
  \ views of the  blue Mediterranean are presented to the town in a 360 degree view.\
  \   Vejer is also known for it's spas and hot springs.  These are the backroads\
  \ of Andalucia, and can be driven in 2-3 day trip increments at a cost of 85+ euros\
  \ for luxurious accommodations.  It's important to venture outside the larger cities.\
  \  Sevilla, Granada, and Malaga are metropoli with freeways and traffic problems.\
  \  They are wonderful cities to fly into with connections to train and bus systems,\
  \ but to see how the people lived in the past it is wonderful  to go to the Pueblos\
  \ Blancos up into the mountains of Cadiz.  They will surprise you with their beauty\
  \ and history."
