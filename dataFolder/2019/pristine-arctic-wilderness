Text: "I made my way upstairs where my rubber boots and down jacket were waiting in\
  \ the coatroom. I quickly bundled up and adjusted my face mask in the mirror, thinking\
  \ how ridiculous I must have looked. We were sailing towards the pack ice north\
  \ of Stor\xF8ya when I remember thinking, \u201CIt looks like someone threw buckets\
  \ of ice into the ocean\u201D. The cold air whipped my face, our boat chugging along.\
  \ \_It was here in the pack ice where we hoped to find polar bears and it was all\
  \ hands on deck for the search. While we encountered seals and birds, a good indicator\
  \ that bears were nearby, we couldn\u2019t find bear tracks. Our guides decided\
  \ it was best to move on and the following morning, we arrived at a tiny island\
  \ in the middle of nowhere surrounded only by sea and the occasional iceberg\u2026\
  \ the sad reality of a warming planet. Prior to disembarkation for this lesser visited\
  \ island, one of our guides had mentioned he\u2019d never come here without seeing\
  \ a bear. As we walked up and down the tiny, narrow strip of land called Karl XII\
  \ \xD8ya in Svalbard, our guides were constantly on the lookout\u2014even more so\
  \ than usual. After about two hours of photographing the landscape, it was time\
  \ to return to the boat. The captain had already pulled up the anchor and began\
  \ sailing in the opposite direction when our guide came knocking on our cabin doors\u2026\
  \ there was a polar bear!\n\nThe captain maneuvered along the desolate coast, turning\
  \ back towards Karl XII \xD8ya as we stood in the cold waiting for the perfect shot.\
  \ Three layers of shirts, three layers of pants, two layers of socks, waterproof\
  \ boots, a beanie, a face mask, a buff, a scarf, three layers of gloves, a down\
  \ jacket and I was still cold with the wind chill (but I\u2019m from sunny Los Angeles).\
  \ Standing on the bow of the ship with my 600mm lens, my hopes of getting a good\
  \ photograph were diminishing\u2026 The island was still too far away and the water\
  \ was too shallow to continue by boat. Suddenly, our guide said \u201COkay, let\u2019\
  s try with the zodiacs now\u201D and the entire crew came outside to lower two zodiacs\
  \ as we hurriedly grabbed more camera gear, stocking up on batteries. Less than\
  \ five minutes later we were racing across the water, buffeted by a ferocious wind.\
  \ For nearly an hour, we crouched low in the zodiacs photographing the bear from\
  \ a distance I never imagined possible. I had seen polar bears in the Greenland\
  \ and Canadian High Arctic, but never this close. We were so close to the shore\
  \ that at one point, the 3-year old female polar bear charged straight towards us,\
  \ barely stopping at the shoreline. Thanks to our expert guides who immediately\
  \ reversed the zodiacs, we quickly put distance between ourselves and the bear.\
  \ While photographing from a zodiac, fast shutter speeds and automatic focus are\
  \ essential. It was especially relevant in this instance. I never took my finger\
  \ off the shutter while we were reversing even though I could have easily lost my\
  \ balance and fallen into the icy water surrounding me. We continued to observe\
  \ as the bear meandered along the shoreline, at one point smelling where we had\
  \ hiked, before she settled in for a nap. \n\nAs we sailed back into Longyearbyen,\
  \ I couldn\u2019t help but reflect on this beautiful Arctic wilderness I had the\
  \ pleasure of experiencing. From incredible animal sightings to jaw-dropping landscapes\
  \ to being alone with nature, Svalbard holds an unmeasurable amount of beauty. I\
  \ trudged through mud, sand, uneven rocks, stayed out for hours in the bitter cold\
  \ and at times I was even waist deep in snow photographing some of the most pristine\
  \ wilderness I\u2019ve ever encountered. Svalbard looks like a landscape from the\
  \ end of an ice age\u2026 it's bare, the vegetation is sparse, and over half the\
  \ land is covered in glaciers. The bleak wilderness of Arctic Norway is dangerous\
  \ and unforgiving, but these conditions are part of what makes it so special. With\
  \ vast, creaking icebergs, snow-capped mountains, fjords, and an abundance of wildlife,\
  \ this archipelago is truly spectacular."
