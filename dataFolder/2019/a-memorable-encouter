Text: "The meaning of traveling may vary from one person to another, which is only\
  \ natural. But for me, the raw core of traveling can never be achieved without the\
  \ birth of a local connection. It was my first travel experience outside the country\
  \ \u2014 back in the summer of 2015 \u2014 and I had already spent 10 days is Germany\
  \ doing nothing but wandering in the streets absorbing the beauty of the small town\
  \ of \u201CBielefeld\u201D, trying different foods and drinks, and most of all doing\
  \ some shopping like a regular tourist. Don\u2019t get me wrong It was a pleasant\
  \ experience, but I still felt like a disconnected soul, only watching mesmerizing\
  \ landscapes and brilliant architecture from the outside of a picture frame without\
  \ actually indulging in it. Sure, I had talked to certain people; a barista, the\
  \ nice cashier lady, the girl trying not to sound envious while complimenting on\
  \ my new tan that added shine upon my already brown skin. But I had yet a long way\
  \ to go if I wanted to make this trip memorable, with only 5 days left for me before\
  \ packing my bags and heading back home. During those two weeks, I was staying with\
  \ my uncle and his family \u2014 who were Germans \u2014 and I already got to know\
  \ a lot of their everyday habits, but that didn\u2019t feel enough for me. I felt\
  \ like somehow I wasn\u2019t getting the true essence of the German culture due\
  \ to the presence of my Tunisian uncle and the close relationship we had. Three\
  \ days before my flight home, I got what I wished for. We were going to a birthday\
  \ party for my uncle\u2019s Brother-in-law Mike. Mike\u2019s family lived in a beautiful\
  \ contemporary house in the outside of a village in \u201CK\xF6ln\u201D, and I absolutely\
  \ LOVED that town. The gorgeous traditional details of the very rich German culture\
  \ were mixed with the breathtaking chic architecture in the most magical way possible.\
  \ Even the parks and farms outside the town were a work of art. We arrived at the\
  \ house, and I immediately felt the warmth of a loving family. Mike and his wife\
  \ had the cutest little girl named \u201CSophie\u201D. She was 4 years old and she\
  \ kept touching my hair because it was curly and unfamiliar to her, which I thought\
  \ was very sweet and flattering. There were a lot of people attending that party,\
  \ my uncle\u2019s family, Mike\u2019s parents, his wife\u2019s parents \u2014 who\
  \ were divorced \u2014 and their spouses. Luckily for me, they all welcomed me and\
  \ asked me all sorts of questions about my school, my family, and my interests and\
  \ hobbies. I in return took the opportunity to have fun and enjoy the simple pleasure\
  \ of experiencing first-hand the interaction with the locals and noticing all of\
  \ their little habits and the things they laugh at or even frown upon. Although\
  \ I didn\u2019t speak German, they used English to address me which I really appreciated,\
  \ but even when I wasn\u2019t part of their conversation I found myself very comfortable\
  \ observing their lifestyle. That evening eventually became one of my favorite memories\
  \ during that vacation, especially when I got the chance to go on a ride on the\
  \ back of what could easily be the most beautiful horse to ever exist. It was stunningly\
  \ white and golden brown with a royal vibe to its stride and long white hair pulled\
  \ into a braid straddling its side. It was my first time riding a horse and it couldn\u2019\
  t be any better, thanks to those lovely people that I had the pleasure to encounter\
  \ and will keep on hoping to pay them another visit very soon."
