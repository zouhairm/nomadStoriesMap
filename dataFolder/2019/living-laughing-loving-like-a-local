Text: "Sitting on the beach in Monterey Bay, Jamaica at the resort where I was staying,\
  \ I was first approached by \u201CJohnny.\u201D He asked, \u201Cdo you party, mon?\u201D\
  \  I just grinned and replied, \u201CI want to see the REAL Jamaica.\u201D  That\u2019\
  s where my adventures began!\n\nThe next two weeks found me in the village across\
  \ the street much more often than at the resort.  In fact, I grew to have a certain\
  \ disdain for the resort due to the way the locals were treated.  I learned from\
  \ the locals and got to see things through their eyes instead of just sitting on\
  \ the beach being served.\n\nOne of the first things I noticed was, of course, the\
  \ poverty.  However, this was almost forgotten as it was eclipsed by the happiness.\
  \  The lack of concern for material possessions was not only refreshing, but it\
  \ was also educational.  Johnny took me to his grandmother\u2019s house (where I\
  \ would have dinner later in my stay) and all around the village to meet everyone.\
  \  The friendliness and welcoming attitude of everyone I encountered was exhilarating.\
  \  \n\nI was soon playing soccer with the villagers, and the calls of \u201CWhite\
  \ Boy\u201D to pass the ball to them had no malice in them.  They simply did not\
  \ know my name, and I was the only white guy around!  Soccer became an almost daily\
  \ part of my stay as I looked forward to my walk across the street each day to go\
  \ join in the fun.  \n\nThe soccer was not the only reason I looked forward to my\
  \ walks across the street.  Fabian also made me look forward to my visits.  Johnny\
  \ had introduced me to her on the third day I was there, and we spent most evenings\
  \ walking around, watching the sunset, and talking about life.  I was constantly\
  \ amazed at how the things that typically stressed people out (especially Americans)\
  \ seemed rather silly to her.  Race was one of the biggest examples.\n\nHaving grown\
  \ up in the southeast of the United States, I had seen racism in all forms.  Then,\
  \ I served in the military and watched as cliques of different races grouped together.\
  \  There were the people, like me, who wanted to hang out with everyone regardless\
  \ of race, and the people in the small village where I was acted as if race was\
  \ of absolutely no significance whatsoever.  One night talking to Fabian I told\
  \ her how it was so nice to have race not be an issue.  She simply replied, \u2018\
  why would it be?\u201D\n\nSitting on the beach with my newly made friends was quite\
  \ an interesting experience.  The people who worked at the resort were not very\
  \ welcoming to the locals. One day, a young man with dreadlocks down to his knees\
  \ walked up to the shower on the beach to wash off the sand and the salt.  One of\
  \ the resort employees came running up yelling, \u201Cyou cannot use that pipe!\u201D\
  \  The ensuing argument about WHY he was not allowed to use the pipe was entertaining,\
  \ puzzling, and a little disturbing.  The entertaining part was that the young man\
  \ was standing underneath the shower the entire time the argument was going on.\
  \  The puzzling part was exactly why it was such an issue, and the disturbing part\
  \ was the condescension with which the employee spoke to the young man.  The conclusion\
  \ of this verbal altercation came when the young man flung his dreadlocks, now thoroughly\
  \ soaked, and sent what seemed like gallons of water through the air dousing the\
  \ employee.  Then, the young man smiled and walked off.  As I sat laughing at this\
  \ turn of events, the very defined lines between resort employee and non-resort\
  \ employee were very clear to me.  I was also clear on why I got along so much better\
  \ with the locals than I did with the employees.  \n\nThe experiences in the village\
  \ gave me a great appreciation of how happiness is achieved through the people around\
  \ you \u2013 NOT through things you have.  While I already had this kind of philosophy\
  \ to some extent, the time I spent in Jamaica definitely solidified those thoughts\
  \ and will stay with me throughout my life."
