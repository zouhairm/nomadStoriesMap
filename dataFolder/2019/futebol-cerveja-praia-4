Text: "Well said by some \u201CTravelling and exploring is the best way to know about\
  \ the people, places and their cultres and values\u201D. Brazil, a country in South\
  \ Ameria, famous for carnival, beaches and Caipirinha. Language spoken Portuguese,\
  \ and the accent differ according to the states in Brazil. I was all alone travelling\
  \ to Brazil from a country over the  seven seas: India. As soon as I reached Brazil,\
  \ landing to Florian\xF3polis, Santa Catrina, I had a family waiting for me, they\
  \ were like parents who looked after my accomodation in Brazil. Language being a\
  \ most important aspect wherever you go in the world, is like weapon to communicate.\
  \ In this case I was weaponless with the portugese language and I had to travel\
  \ and explore for 10 months. Brazil being a country that majority of the people\
  \ just know how to speak portugu\xEAs and spanish. The first barrier  I faced was\
  \ the second day in Brazil where I wanted to buy bread and some grocery, I literally\
  \ pointed out the things I wanted in the super market, in some situations I would\
  \ also use  Google translate it was like a cheat weapon to me so that I can communicate\
  \ with the people. I was encountered with this situation for 3 weeks, but later\
  \ I started understanding the vocabulary of the language, and trust me I started\
  \ speaking portugese in the 5th month. \nWhenever you want to learn a language start\
  \ talking with the native people of the place. Parties were something which were\
  \ whole to a new different level. The most fascinating trip I enjoyed was the Itaipu\
  \ dam: the biggest dam in terms of energy production after china, the dam is made\
  \ by two countries Pragyua and Brazil. I started my trip from the north of the Brazil,\
  \ Jerricocoara: well know for wide variety of fruits and sandunes beachs, and so\
  \ on till Rion de Janerio: well know for the beach Copacabana, this is were I tried\
  \ Caipirinha for the first time, this the place where Caipirinha is originated from,\
  \ also watched match in Maracana staidium for the first time, & now it was time\
  \ to go back to the home country India, with all the lovely memories of Brazil!!\
  \ Till then good bye, will see you with another intersting story of Brazil"
