  \ encouraged me to become the best .\nMother: Does not your father tell you about\

  \ You will continue your study abroad\n....\nI do not know that there are those\
  \ who look after my dreams other than me \n...\nThe decision to travel, I left my\

  \ to call it the country of love, whenever I look anywhere I find the Couples and\
  \ I find them hold each other, who laughs and who quarrels and who carries his love\
  \ and who accepts The hand of his sweetheart and the one who tries to hold on to\
  \ his hand and the one trying to get away from his hands\nI was watching all the\
  \ love situations that have long been resolved that I would love one day\n...\n\
  The days passed and everyday i get closer with him \u201C fadi \u201C\nSo that day\
