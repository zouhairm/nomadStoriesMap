Text: "Once I woke up in the morning sitting in front of the house my friend was looking\
  \ at me like satan for taking him for a ride around the block yes my best friend\
  \ my motorcycle RX135 he didn\u2019t let me stand on road giving me shit, we traveled\
  \ into the wildness of Nilambur rain forest giving a lifetime treat of view and\
  \ ride we gone deep into the forest to a mountain top the view from there changes\
  \ my life the sunset was something that had to be experienced and camped there for\
  \ the night there was some food left with I just ate with the campfire at night\
  \ , turned down the camp fire all that left heated ashes a sat there and looked\
  \ above the sky counting stars it was pleasant night I couldn\u2019t sleep much,\
  \ just staring at the stars as if it was first time in life, sunrise was another\
  \ experience with sun in red color I stood there as if I was standing at the edge\
  \ of the world and after seeing the sunset I returned with her yes my love my motorcycle\
  \ Melissa , we are one where ever i go she will be with me , I could talk to her\
  \ for a longtime as if time was moving fast and I couldn\u2019t talk enough, still\
  \ I was talking to her like sitting in the front talking about the travel story"
