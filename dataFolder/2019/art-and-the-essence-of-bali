Text: "All noise from the busy street behind faded away as I stepped into the shade\
  \ of the leafy entrance to the Agung Rai Museum of Art. I took a deep breath in.\
  \ The heady scent of incense lingered in the air, mingled with the humidity and\
  \ fragrant frangipani. I took a long exhale, and closed my eyes. Silence is hard\
  \ to come by in Ubud, the bustling cultural hub of Bali. It was my fourth day here\
  \ and already the constant drone of moped engines, steady stream of tourists and\
  \ relentless cries of street hawkers had begun to take its toll. The concealed entrance\
  \ to the museum seemed to offer respite from the mid-afternoon heat, so I followed\
  \ the path around to the gardens.\n\nDappled sunlight shone through a canopy of\
  \ leaves, and the sound of trickling water from a nearby fountain merged with the\
  \ gentle notes of a xylophone. I glanced to my right and saw an old Balinese man\
  \ sat up in a bal\xE9 (a Balinese gazebo) his head tilted to one side, his eyes\
  \ downcast onto the bamboo instrument before him. I smiled up at him as I walked\
  \ past. \u201CYou want to play?\u201D I heard him say. The music had stopped, and\
  \ the garden was enveloped by a delicious quietude, a sense of time standing still.\
  \ \u201COkay,\u201D I replied, and climbed up onto the bale to sit down next to\
  \ him. As I picked up the sticks to play, another man sat down quietly behind us\
  \ and started to play the flute.\n\nI learnt that Wayan and Bram were not only musicians,\
  \ they were also traditional Balinese artists working on commission for the museum,\
  \ and they took me over to see their open-air studio. Large canvases of unfinished\
  \ paintings were propped up against golden pillars, sketches were scattered across\
  \ the marble floor and empty coffee glasses were dotted amongst the boxes of paints.\
  \ Bram poured me a strong glass of coffee, whilst Wayan lit a cigarette and slumped\
  \ back in his plastic chair, contemplating his unfinished painting of a Kecak dance.\n\
  \nI sat on the cool marble floor next to Made, another resident artist, watching\
  \ him add careful black outlines to the trees in his huge painting of Mount Agung.\
  \ His paintbrush poised mid-air, he asked if I would like to add some myself. This\
  \ piece would soon be hanging in the gallery, a gallery which Queen Elizabeth herself\
  \ came to visit some years ago, and he wanted my clumsy hand to add the finishing\
  \ touches to his masterpiece? He must have noticed the confusion in my face, because\
  \ he smiled and simply handed the brush over to me. Tentatively, I added a shaky\
  \ stroke of black to the thin trunk of a tree. I looked back to Made, who simply\
  \ smiled and nodded.\n\nAnother man perched on the corner of the marble floor was\
  \ watching us silently with smiling eyes. He was wearing a headscarf like the other\
  \ artists, but instead of a paint-spattered T-shirt he wore a crisp white shirt\
  \ over his sarong. He was Mr Agung Rai himself, the founder of the museum. He began\
  \ to explain the concept behind his museum, where art transcends the gallery space.\
  \ \u201CYou must look for the art that is everywhere, not just inside the museum,\u201D\
  \ he said, waving his arm across the garden. \u201CSee the sunlight filtering through\
  \ the green leaves, the layers of branches, flowers and stone, the vibration of\
  \ the place\u2026\u201D He believes that the energy surrounding the gardens is what\
  \ draws people in from the street outside, and I wondered if that was why I was\
  \ there myself.\n\nWe sat for a while longer, talking and drinking coffee, before\
  \ I continued my walk through the grounds. As I wandered around, his words fresh\
  \ in my mind, I tried to notice the art around me. I stopped to look, to smell,\
  \ to listen, to touch, to feel\u2026 And I got the sense that something else was\
  \ at work here, an intangible essence that drifts in the air like incense smoke.\
  \ I realised that art is just one of the many threads that weaves into the complicated\
  \ fabric that is the spirit of Bali."
