Text: "I arrive at gate 34, Auckland Air port and already it feels as though I\u2019\
  ve arrived in another country. There is not a word of English spoken and I am the\
  \ only European in site. This is not a feeling I\u2019ve experienced before, as\
  \ I look around me I realise that I\u2019m also the only female. I wonder if I should\
  \ be scared but instead I\u2019m curious and excited. I\u2019m about to leave my\
  \ Anglo world behind. Where are all the women I wonder? \n\nFinally, two middle\
  \ aged European women arrive. One is a diplomat who has been visiting New Zealand\
  \ for medial treatment. She tells me that the men are returning home after the kiwifruit\
  \ picking season. She also tells me to make sure I boil my water. I continue to\
  \ bombard her with questions but mostly I\u2019m fascinated at the men around me,\
  \ by their dark skin, their thick afros and large smiles.  To me they seem African\
  \ but I find out later are Melanesian. \n\nI\u2019m visiting my friend Hanna. She\
  \ is the most exciting friend I had made in a long time and she had recently moved\
  \ home to Vanuatu. \u201CYou have to Visit me\u201D she had insisted. So six months\
  \ later there I was at Auckland Airport. We had chatted on the phone excitedly about\
  \ my planned visit and how much we were looking forward to seeing each other. We\
  \ had talked about art, about literature and about our complicated non-existent\
  \ love lives but not about Vanuatu. The reality was When I arrived in Port Villa\
  \ late that stormy night I had no idea what to expect. Aside form having some vague\
  \ pictures of myself sunbathing under coconut trees while drinking coconut juice\
  \ the only thing I knew about Vanuatu was that it was a bunch of tropical islands\
  \ in the south Pacific. \n\nWhat unravelled was a journey of intrigue and fascination\
  \ that couldn\u2019t have been further away from the postcard picture of what I\
  \ thought a tropical holiday was. The next morning it was as if I had woken up inside\
  \ a botanists dream. Vanuatu\u2019s rich volcanic soil and tropical climate meant\
  \ an abundance of growth. Everything was bigger, brighter, stronger. There were\
  \ huge Banyan trees with masses of long protruding roots that made them seem as\
  \ though they had come straight out of The Lord of the Rings. There were Frangipani\
  \ trees whose flowers littered the streets and fragrance mingled with mud and tar\
  \ and dust. And the markets were loaded high with fresh Herbs and Island Cabbage,\
  \ Yams the size of Banyan tree roots and Pawpaw, Coconuts and Sweet Bananas. When\
  \ it rained it seemed the sky cracked open and the contents of an entire ocean was\
  \ being poured in minutes, only to suddenly stop and evaporate in seconds leaving\
  \ a think mosquito filled mugginess in its wake. And there were coconut crabs that\
  \ ate coconuts which they cracked opened with their mouths.\n\nWhat I hadn\u2019\
  t realised was that Vanuatu was a developing country. There were no taxes and very\
  \ little infrastructure. Nothing worked in the way it worked in the first world.\
  \ Talking to people was more reliable than the internet and relationships were more\
  \ important than time. Things happened when they happened. The roads were filled\
  \ with potholes and people carried live chickens in their hand luggage. There was\
  \ no subway and busses were actually mini vans whose drivers after 4pm had a high\
  \ chance of being under the influence of Kava. I also learned that Santo was like\
  \ the wild west and that the police did very little unless you paid them.\n\nMy\
  \ time in Vanuatu taught me to expect the unexpected and to not expect anything\
  \ at all. I went from staying in an ex-military ballroom on a Kava plantation run\
  \ by about 20 cats and dogs, to discovering the underwater alien world of live coral\
  \ and to lean that a seemingly abandoned dirt road was in fact a highway into a\
  \ thriving jungle village ruled by a Kava King eager to feed me Kava and Cassava\
  \ and various tubers and treat me like an exotic princess. This kava Kings biggest\
  \ dream?  To pick pick kiwifruit in New Zealand."
