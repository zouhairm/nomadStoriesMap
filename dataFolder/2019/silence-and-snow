Text: "My Fitbit tells me that it\u2019s almost noon, but the sky above remains dark\
  \ and sunless. This isn\u2019t the same as the Arctic twilight I\u2019ve seen before\
  \ in Troms\xF8 or Reykjavik, which still has flecks of navy and cobalt on the horizon.\
  \ Here in Longyearbyen, there are no blue tones at all, January is black\u2014unrelentingly,\
  \ ceaselessly black. \n\nIn front of me are rows and rows of huskies\u2014maybe\
  \ sixty of them\u2014all tethered to small wooden kennels. Their barking is oddly\
  \ dampened in the wide open space of the paddock. They aren\u2019t huge creatures,\
  \ but each dog jumps up on powerful hind legs as I walk gingerly through them towards\
  \ the sled. \n  \t\u201CThey\u2019re excited, not aggressive,\u201D says my guide,\
  \ Andreas, perhaps picking up that I\u2019m more of a cat person. He doesn\u2019\
  t enlist my help as he selects dogs and untethers them from their kennels to tie\
  \ them to the sled. I instead stand on the large metal pedal that acts as a break,\
  \ pushing the heavy Caribou boots I\u2019ve hired down into the ground as hard as\
  \ I possibly can. \n\t\nWhen he has tied six dogs to the sled, Andreas motions for\
  \ me to take a seat on the flat part in front\u2014he\u2019ll stand behind, the\
  \ reins in his hand and a rifle at his side in case we encounter polar bears. I\u2019\
  ve been told it\u2019s highly unlikely, but I can\u2019t help scanning the dark\
  \ horizon, torn between desire to see them and fear. We\u2019re going out into the\
  \ valley, away from the tiny main drag of downtown Longyearbyen (an intriguing mix\
  \ of an old mining town and a burgeoning tourist hot spot) and out to where the\
  \ wilderness begins. Andreas shouts a command and the dogs are off, sprinting away\
  \ and within minutes leaving the lights of the shelter behind.\n\nNeither my camera\
  \ nor phone battery would withstand the cold, so I\u2019ve left all electronics\
  \ behind. All I have is wide-open eyes to record these memories. The valley is entirely\
  \ uninhabited; no human footprints or ski tracks mark the snow. The only other person\
  \ here is Andreas behind me. But in the twenty-first century, is there really any\
  \ such thing as remoteness? I\u2019m flushed by my luck to be here and yet simultaneously\
  \ aware that I\u2019m simply the forerunner of the many tourists that are starting\
  \ come here to experience the Northernmost town in the world for themselves. According\
  \ to the Svalbard tourism board, over the last decade the annual number of tourists\
  \ has risen from 41000 to 67000 in 2017. The archipelago is clearly on the map now\
  \ and I wonder whether there will ever again be the same isolation in these hills\
  \ that I\u2019m experiencing right now.\n\nI\u2019m wearing a thermal suit, gloves\
  \ and three layers of thermal underwear. Yet even through my woollen beanie, I feel\
  \ like I did as a kid when we drank cold drinks too quickly on a hot day. Brain\
  \ freeze, we\u2019d shriek at each other. That\u2019s precisely what I feel now,\
  \ as a grown woman in the dark of Svalbard. It\u2019s so fiercely cold that it is\
  \ as if the wind is blowing against my brain and crystallising it. In front of me\
  \ I see the flash of the dogs\u2019 paws as they run and hear the chink of the harness\
  \ and the shuffling of the sled. The pointed canine faces swivel back to us from\
  \ time to time, looking to Andreas for some kind of reassurance. He croons to them\
  \ with words I cannot understand. \n\nAt the furthest point of the valley, Andreas\
  \ stops the sled. Suddenly, there is nothing\u2014just quiet and darkness all around\
  \ us. I can dimly make out the black outline of mountains, but not see them clearly.\
  \ There are no birds to make a sound and now that we\u2019ve stopped, not even the\
  \ wind whistles past. I\u2019ve heard people talk about an \u201Carctic silence\u201D\
  \ and realise with a jolt that this is what I\u2019m experiencing right now. I can\
  \ hear only the sound of my breath and the slight movements of the dogs nuzzling\
  \ the snow. And, for that one exhilarating moment, nothing else seems to matter."
