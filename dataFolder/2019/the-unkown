Text: "Fall hit, the leaves falling from the tree, the cool breeze that hit your face\
  \ like a splash of water in a hot summer day I would have lived it except I knew\
  \ what that meant that I would soon be leaving forever.MY parents told me that in\
  \ fall we would be moving back to their home country in Mexico. I was raised in\
  \ Los Angeles a wonderful city full of diversity, beauty and where all my relatives\
  \ and friends lived, how could I ever leave my home behind!\n\nThe dreaded day was\
  \ here, it was also my fall festival my parents didn\u2019t even wait for it to\
  \ finish they showed up in the car with all the things packed, I remember the tears\
  \ running down my cheeks, the empty void I felt in my chest, my brain going over\
  \ the thought that tomorrow was going to be different that nothing would ever be\
  \ the same.\nWe drove awhile before we got the border that separated the US and\
  \ Mexico that\u2019s when it really hit me, there was no going back; as we passed\
  \ through the border check points into Mexico I felt a pressure in my heart, those\
  \ pressure you get when you\u2019re scared because that\u2019s what I was scared\
  \ of the new world that was out there.\n\nI was now in Mexico everything seemed\
  \ pretty similar of course the air felt different, I don\u2019t even know if that\u2019\
  s possible or it was just my mind processing the change. We were moving to the center\
  \ of Mexico in a State called Guanajuato which was about a 3-day drive.\n\nThe first\
  \ day was the worst, maybe I made it far worse than it actually was but I couldn\u2019\
  t enjoy any of it because I felt like I was betraying myself by doing so. Hours\
  \ passed, and we were now somewhere in Mexico with a beautiful beach, the sky was\
  \ gray, the wind made a sound so soothing that it took all my worries with it and\
  \ that\u2019s when I knew I was in love.\nI wasn\u2019t in love with a person or\
  \ a place or a moment or a memory, I was in love with the idea of all the possibilities\
  \ a new place could give me, all the things it could make me feel, all the things\
  \ that it was going to give me and that were going cure my soul from any negative\
  \ emotion I would ever feel.\nThat was traveling is to me, it\u2019s falling in\
  \ love with everyplace, every culture, every person you could ever meet, it\u2018\
  s destiny waiting to put you in out you\u2019re supposed to be in.\n\nMaybe it was\
  \ a moment in life, destiny or something in the air but I knew that my life was\
  \ going to change and that it was never going to be the same."
