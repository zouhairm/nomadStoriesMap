Text: "Enjoying Cambodia so much, I decided to stay here for a while and visit some\
  \ places which were recommended in my Lonely Planet guidebook. One place which caught\
  \ my attention was Krong Kampot which is located on the Southern coastline approximately\
  \ 155km South West from the capital city Phnom Penh.\n\nI decided to take a small\
  \ group bus from the capital city to Kampot, which only cost me $14 (US dollars\
  \ are widely accepted in Cambodia), and was air-conditioned and shared with other\
  \ tourists. During the 4 hour journey some of us shared our travel experiences whilst\
  \ others preferred to get some sleep.\n\nUpon arrival in Kampot, I was straight\
  \ away glad to see the calmness and tranquility of the local people. I had previously\
  \ come from visiting Siem Reap and Phnom Penh which, although very enjoyable and\
  \ definitely worth seeing, were extremely busy and the vast majority of tourists\
  \ flock there, particularly in high season, because of their incredible attractions.\n\
  \nWhat I didn't expect to find in Kampot was the French influence on the city. Many\
  \ French ex-pats had decided to call this place home and many of the bars, restaurants,\
  \ and local art shops were part-owned by French people or had French people working\
  \ there. I also saw that much of the architecture had a heavy French influence.\
  \ I found this fascinating and decided to do some more digging... What I discovered\
  \ was that Kampot was under French colonial administration during the 19th Century\
  \ and the 'Circonscription R\xE9sidentielle de Kampot' was one of Cambodia's most\
  \ important sea ports. However, I was still confused by the current 21st Century\
  \ influence so decided to ask some of the ex-pats. The majority of the feedback\
  \ I received was that it had become a popular place for creatives, digital nomads\
  \ and extended-stay travellers. Word obviously spread among the French that you\
  \ can live and eat extremely cheaply with the added bonuses that the weather is\
  \ incredible and your local tongue is also widely spoken and understood! Magnifique!\n\
  \nOther surprising findings of this charming city were found during the climbing\
  \ of the Bokor Mountain. After doing some reading about the mountain I decided to\
  \ rent a scooter and take a day trip there (I would advise only renting a scooter\
  \ if you have driving experience, otherwise tours to the mountain are very cheap).\
  \ \nFollowing the long a winding road up, I was continually having to stop to take\
  \ pictures of the surrounding incredible nature and view of the city. \nThen you\
  \ will be greeted by the Lok Yeay Mao statue where hunters and travellers come to\
  \ pray for protection. Below the statue, you can also find statues of the 12 Chinese\
  \ Zodiacs. \nContinuing the journey you will find Wat Sampov Pram, a beautiful Buddhist\
  \ temple where you can rest and find quiet time. \nThe most surprising part of this\
  \ mountain journey was the discovery of Bokor Hill Station. A collection of French\
  \ colonial buildings constructed as a retreat for colonial residents where, apparently,\
  \ 'the temperature was more bearable for them.' This collection of buildings includes\
  \ an abandoned Catholic church, a casino, and the abandoned Bokor Palace Hotel.\
  \ \nAnd this journey didn't end yet! My final finding on the mountain was the stunning\
  \ Povokvil Waterfalls. An area surrounded by wild nature and hiking trails. Near\
  \ the entrance you can find a cafe/restaurant where you can pick up some refreshments\
  \ and relax a while before attempting some of the trails.\n\nIf you decide to take\
  \ a trip to Bokor mountain I would recommend taking a tour guide for the first time\
  \ to make sure you see all of the attractions and get some knowledge of the local\
  \ history. Also don't forget to take plenty of water, food, and sunscreen. Take\
  \ a light jacket as it gets a bit colder towards the top of the mountain where the\
  \ air is a bit thinner. Allow plenty of time to get down the mountain before dark,\
  \ and then go and grab some fine French cuisine in the city to reward your hard\
  \ work ;)\n\nKampot and Cambodia will delight and surprise you. Be sure to add it\
  \ to your travel list! Bon voyage!"
