Text: 'Greece island Crete. Once, life was in full swing here, important events for
  the history of mankind replaced each other. Now life has been in a deep crisis.
  However, nature is not subject to boring politics and economics. Crete is beautiful:
  sea, sun, fruit. Tourist guides often go for tricks to attract tourists, talk about
  fabulous beaches, on which they shot advertising "Bounty" - heavenly delight. Of
  course, you immediately imagine a white beach, gentle sand and beautiful sea. To
  liven up this performance, I and my young man rented a cabriolet and went to the
  beach from an advertisement for a coconut bar. In the dangerous road we spent about
  three hours, our car refused to go, there were problems during the ascent into the
  mountains. But our dream of a beautiful beach led us. I was already dizzy from the
  constant turns - to the left, to the right. Well, a sign appeared on the horizon,
  and now I am taking a swim in the azure sea. Parking fee, there was almost no empty
  seats, but we left our car in the shade. With my eyes wide open, I hurry to the
  dream beach. Pebbles, 6 low palm trees, rocky coast - disappointment? Yes! After
  all, this is not the beach, which the guides so vividly described to us.'
