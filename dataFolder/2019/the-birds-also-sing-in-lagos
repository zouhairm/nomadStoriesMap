Text: "This morning, for the first time in Lagos, I heard the song of a bird. It was\
  \ not the crowing of a backyard, vagabond chicken getting ready to scavenge the\
  \ waste dump for breakfast. It was more like a migrant warbler crooning for his\
  \ coy lover or making up for what he lacked in looks with a grand song. It was that\
  \ type of birdsong you heard in the village bushes when you followed your grandmother,\
  \ who is now dead, to her cassava farm. I heard it in the bathroom at about 6:00am\
  \ as I readied myself for work and I thought, So birds sing in Lagos?\nPerhaps they\
  \ have been singing all the while, but the din of the city and its accompanying\
  \ anxieties did not let me hear. January was when I abandoned the small-town life\
  \ I had been born in for a chance to broaden the scope of my fortune by moving here.\
  \ Now saying the word \u201Cfortune\u201D makes me chuckle at myself; if fortune\
  \ came to me dressed in head to toe Gucci, I may not recognize her. Adventure is\
  \ a much more suitable word, for I have dined and commuted with it daily since my\
  \ sojourn.\nMy first week was smooth sailing. A new year found the city empty of\
  \ people who had migrated to saner and calmer parts of the country for holiday.\
  \ At the park, I easily found buses going to Victoria Island where I worked. Whenever\
  \ I arrived early, my boss would say, You are coming all the way from Ketu and you\
  \ are this early? Wait till next week; you may not be so lucky.\nSecond week came\
  \ and while I slept, people poured back into Lagos and I did not know. It was 6:23am\
  \ and I was still trying on new shoes. My host said to me, It\u2019s past six and\
  \ you\u2019re still here? It appears you don\u2019t want to go to work today. I\
  \ got to the park and there it was: a mammoth crowd. This was the evil day everyone\
  \ had told me to anticipate. The buses to V.I came but body mass and willpower were\
  \ working at my disadvantage; I was flung so far away from the car that in that\
  \ swift moment, the minutes I spent making up my face became futile. Another vehicle\
  \ came and the crowd surged towards it, and for thirty minute the theatrics displayed\
  \ again and again. People ran after cars like maniacs, like it was the last train\
  \ to heaven; they yanked at door handles without minding if they ripped them apart.\
  \ I stood aside and watched the way Monday mornings humiliated middle-class Lagosians\
  \ with no vehicles of their own. It was so\u2026deplorable. But time was ticking\
  \ fast. Either I joined in this charade or stood aloof and acted like this whole\
  \ stampede was beneath me. I had an hour\u2019s journey ahead of me; I had a new\
  \ boss I was dying to impress with my punctuality. I became so overwhelmed with\
  \ grief that I wanted to sit in the middle of the park and call my mother and cry.\
  \ Who sent me here? I thought of all the small towns I had lived in\u200A\u2014\u200A\
  Umuahia, Owerri, Ilorin, Nsukka\u200A\u2014\u200Awhere bike men would hoot at you\
  \ and ask you if you wanted them to take you to your destination, and on those bikes,\
  \ you can steal glances at yourself, pat your hair down with the windows of cars\
  \ that drove by. I looked at the heaving men and women in this Lagos park and knew\
  \ I did not want to be part of this. Thank God for Uber, even though I paid a week\u2019\
  s transport fare for a single ride.\nTo avoid running after vehicles like a mad\
  \ person, wake up early. I wish it was that simple. When it rains, crowing before\
  \ the birds may not save you. It happened to me once, sometime in March; I had to\
  \ beg to hitch a ride to Obalende. But fortune smiled on me when we moved our office\
  \ to Lekki and my boss offered me the boys\u2019 quarters. All I had to do was wake\
  \ up and climb the staircase and Viola! I was at my desk. No encounters with crowded\
  \ parks, no foulmouthed bus riders and conductors. This is every Lagosian\u2019\
  s dream and I, Lagos\u2019s latest greenhorn, was living it.\nHowever, by April,\
  \ after some unfateful sleight of hand, I was without a job. But I found being jobless\
  \ in Lagos is a laughable oxymoron. Jobless? How? Did I come all the way from Umuahia\
  \ to perambulate aimlessly in here? Tell your neighbour Not me! I sought and sought\
  \ for a job. A revered friend put in a word for me in a PR company and I had a new\
  \ offer within days but I was a bit unsettled about it.\nI had come to Lagos to\
  \ fulfil my protracted bohemian dream. I did not want another typical 9\u20135 job.\
  \ I wanted to wear clogs and juju jellies with rip jeans and asymmetrical tops on\
  \ workdays. I did not want to hop buses on stilettos. Having worked in the bank\
  \ before now, I found the corporate look too snobbish and pretentious and I wanted\
  \ none of that again. I kept the offer pending and by some gracious turn of events,\
  \ I landed a job in an art space.\nWhat I find most cherishable here is how surrounded\
  \ one is by opportunities. Perhaps I romanticise but it appears you are standing\
  \ within an inch of possibilities in spite of dirty buses and the absence of birdsongs.\
  \ It may take a little time to find fortune and she may not even be dressed in designers\
  \ when she comes; but I bet you she will come."
