Text: "I was not a spontaneous person. My life revolved around meal plans and bullet\
  \ points and worrying about what I\u2019d do after uni. Then on my year abroad in\
  \ Germany I found myself booking a solo flight to a place I\u2019d only seen in\
  \ Hangover II \u2013 Bangkok, in the Land of Smiles and elephant pants.\n\tA week\
  \ later, I found myself pressed against a fish stall as a red train blazed past,\
  \ slicing through the market like a knife in the morning\u2019s catch. The train\
  \ passed inches from my face, blocking out the sky, and if I\u2019d reached out\
  \ I could\u2019ve high-fived the passengers hanging from the windows. My old self\
  \ told me not to. \n\tThe train blared its horn, locals shouted at tourists taking\
  \ selfies in its path, and then it was gone, swallowed up by the market. I stood\
  \ amazed as the locals immediately lowered their awnings back over the track, their\
  \ tables of jackfruit and packaged durian \u2013 the world\u2019s smelliest fruit\
  \ \u2013 rolling out in the train\u2019s wake. People returned to their shopping,\
  \ the railway track an ordinary high street once more.\n\tMaeklong railway market\
  \ would never be allowed in England. It breaks dozens of health and safety measures,\
  \ I could hear my parents saying. But I was alive, full on noodles, and keen to\
  \ see if the rest of the day would top the morning.\nMy first solo trip wasn\u2019\
  t always this adventurous. In the beginning, I brought my old self along and spent\
  \ a sweaty day touring the temples, with the click of my camera and the odd \u2018\
  khup kun ka\u2019 as my only conversation. More a lonely sightseeing trip than a\
  \ solo adventure. \n\tIronically enough, since I\u2019d come to Bangkok to escape\
  \ rainy Europe, it was rain that turned my trip around. I planned to visit Ayutthaya,\
  \ Thailand\u2019s ancient capital, and would need to navigate the sky train and\
  \ buses myself, but the friendly guys at the hostel said it would rain and I should\
  \ go another day. My first thought: I\u2019m English, I\u2019ve barbequed in the\
  \ rain. Besides, I\u2019ve got an umbrella. My second: we don\u2019t get monsoons\
  \ in England. Maybe I should listen. Then I remembered a Scot who\u2019d asked if\
  \ I wanted to join him and some others for a day around Bangkok. I\u2019d turned\
  \ him down. I already had plans. But now\u2026 \n\tI got out my phone and told him\
  \ I was in. My \u2018solo\u2019 trip was suddenly everything I\u2019d imagined:\
  \ meeting like-minded people from all over the world; trying food with worrying\
  \ translations such as \u2018morning glory;\u2019 exchanging friendly smiles with\
  \ locals who then gave me a portion of their food insisting it was \u2018tasty,\
  \ tasty. You try.\u2019 (I can\u2019t handle spice, so I sacrificed my taste buds\
  \ for the sake of politeness.) I discovered bones I never knew I had during a Thai\
  \ massage that I swear almost broke me in two, and enjoyed a weird watermelon and\
  \ marshmallow cocktail at a bar stuffed with potion bottles. \n\tA highlight was\
  \ a snap decision to visit an indie night market with an American I\u2019d just\
  \ met. It was a favourite with local teens, and there were no other tourists in\
  \ sight as we browsed retro shirts and drank sweet pea juice from bamboo cups. A\
  \ local band played punk rock from a platform glowing under neon blue light \u2013\
  \ familiar music, but unfamiliar lyrics. We took a moment just to soak up the atmosphere;\
  \ the murmur of friendly bartering, the thrum of the guitars, the humid night air\
  \ mixing with the herby, meaty smell of noodles and chicken. My new friend found\
  \ it hilarious when I asked for water and no one understood me, until he stepped\
  \ in with his American \u2018wardda\u2019 and we were immediately handed fresh bottles.\
  \ Moments like that stood out for me far more than my lonely temple tour. By the\
  \ end of my adventure, I knew that solo travel doesn\u2019t mean \u2018solo\u2019\
  \ \u2013 the opposite is true.\n\tA year on, I\u2019m back in my familiar routines,\
  \ but inside I\u2019ve changed. I\u2019m braver where it counts, more laidback where\
  \ it doesn\u2019t, and a part of me always wonders: where next?"
