Text: "As I sat on top of the reddish sand dune, mouth slightly agape, mesmerized\
  \ by the twinkling lights that peppered the desert sky, I felt it. That sense of\
  \ wonder, utter and raw, that I used to only feel as a child, on Christmas morning.\n\
  \nCrinkling laughter brought me back from my reverie. I turned to the source of\
  \ the sound and amused chocolate eyes met my gaze. \nI guess for a Berber, born\
  \ and raised in the desert, the magical sights before me are business as usual.\
  \ I took his hand in mine, intertwining our fingers and just kept staring at the\
  \ Milky Way. \n\n\"You're getting emotional babe.\" How could I not? The last three\
  \ weeks have been nothing short of a crazy whirlwind of \" I never thought this\
  \ could happen to me\" moments. From arriving to the buzzing Marrakesh, a city with\
  \ so much rhythm that you could say it has its own soundtrack, to crying joyful\
  \ tears on a deserted beach in Essaouira, to this point right now, on a dune close\
  \ to Merzouga.\n \nI usually like my travels to be a mixture of well planned sightseeing\
  \ and off the script experiences, where you get lost for hours on tiny cobbled streets\
  \ and experience the full immersion in a foreign culture. \n\nBut for Morocco I\
  \ didn't plan a thing. I just winged it. \n\nI lived the fast paced life of Marrakesh's\
  \ Medina, feeling like a cat with ADHD, jumping from one colorful street to the\
  \ other, munching on the sweetest mandarines I ever tasted, bargaining on trinkets\
  \ and stopping for mint tea at every opportunity.\n\nI discovered the art of slow\
  \ living in Essaouira, where time flows unperturbed, where the sky bleeds orange\
  \ and crimson notes at sunset and the sea lulls you to sleep every night. \n\nI\
  \ learned to eat tagine like the locals, soaking tiny pieces of bread in the spicy,\
  \ savory stew and eating everything just with my hands, no cutlery in sight.\n\n\
  I ate fried fish from small street food joints, I drank wine while watching the\
  \ sun cast its disappearing glow over Sahara.\n\nOn a spur of the moment, I cancelled\
  \ my return flight and bought a new one for a later date just because I wasn't ready\
  \ to give up on this summer-ish piece of heaven in the middle of winter, to this\
  \ feeling of belonging in the middle of strangers. I wasn't ready to give up on\
  \ him. \n\nFrom all the experiences I would have never imagined I could have on\
  \ a random, unplanned trip to Morocco, finding love is the most surreal one. \n\n\
  I squeezed his hand once again and returned my gaze from the bright night sky, sweeping\
  \ over the dark shapes of the dunes. A shiver passed through my bones, the cold\
  \ air dropping more and more around us. \n\nIt was time to head back inside and\
  \ who knows, maybe,to reality."
