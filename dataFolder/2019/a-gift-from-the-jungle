Text: "I had fallen asleep somewhere along the Cuyabeno River and snapped awake when\
  \ my foot hit the warm water. There were twenty or so of us sitting two-by-two in\
  \ the boat, which slung low in the water and resembled a long canoe. There was no\
  \ cover overtop to protect us from the thick Ecuadorian sun. It was the final leg\
  \ of my long journey towards the Amazon that had begun the evening before, when\
  \ I boarded an overnight bus that took me to the city of Nueva Loja. From there,\
  \ the tour group I was with had driven a meandering couple of hours to reach the\
  \ river. I had stretched my cramped legs over the side of the boat, and promptly\
  \ passed out. \n\nNow awake, I absorbed my surroundings as we continued down the\
  \ river. The water, the trees, and the sky were all different shades of a murky,\
  \ relentless green that would come to render many of the photos we took over the\
  \ next four days dark and out of focus. Over years of history, the Amazon had been\
  \ painted as dreamy, dangerous, enchanted, unknown. And now, like so much of the\
  \ world, it had been reduced to this: a handful of tourists, most of us young, white\
  \ and English-speaking, seeking out an adventure we could share later on social\
  \ media.\n\nOf course, exploring a place as complicated as the Amazon be impossible\
  \ without someone who thoroughly understood it. Our guide\u2019s name was F\xE9\
  lix and he spoke to us in English only slightly brushed with a Spanish accent. Navigating\
  \ tourists through the Cuyabeno Reserve was his full-time job. He was pensive and\
  \ sharp-eyed, able to point to the dense trees that rose up on either side of the\
  \ river and say with authority: \u201CLook.\u201D Look at the sloth, the toucan,\
  \ the monkey. On the first day, he slapped a large mosquito on his neck and rolled\
  \ it between his fingers. \u201CUn regalo de la selva,\u201D he joked. A gift from\
  \ the jungle. \n\nIt quickly became apparent that our days were to be spent in one\
  \ of two ways: on the boat and off of it. On the boat, we fished for piranhas, watched\
  \ the trees for wildlife, and gazed up at the stars. Off the boat, we trekked through\
  \ the muddy jungle, stretched out to read in the sun, and swung from a Tarzan rope\
  \ into the river below. In the evening, we retired to thatched huts that looked\
  \ as though they could have been constructed by an Indigenous tribe, but featured\
  \ indoor plumbing, a queen-sized bed covered by a canopy of mosquito netting, and\
  \ a front porch strung with two hammocks. All of our meals were eaten together at\
  \ one long table in the main hut, traditional Ecuadorian food that nevertheless\
  \ catered to the vegetarian and gluten-free amongst us.\n\nOn our final day in the\
  \ Amazon, F\xE9lix brought our boat to a wider spot in the river. \u201CAnother\
  \ group saw the dolphins here this morning,\u201D he told us. \u201CBut we will\
  \ have to wait. Sometimes, they don\u2019t like to be seen.\u201D \n\nHe paddled\
  \ us around in slow, wide circles. We waited, watching the ripples in the cloudy\
  \ water with uncertainty, longing for a glimpse of one pert fin rising toward the\
  \ sky. Suddenly, F\xE9lix\u2019s confident finger pointed to a spot just a couple\
  \ metres ahead of us. \u201CLook!\u201D he urged, and there they were.\n\nFat, pink\
  \ and slippery, they looked nothing like the graceful, leaping dolphins most of\
  \ us knew from marine parks or trips to Cancun. Each of us gasped with startled\
  \ delight, awed to witness a piece of the wild magic that continued to persevere\
  \ in this mysterious jungle. Then the dolphins sunk beneath the water again, out\
  \ of sight, and we drifted away, back towards the world we knew."
