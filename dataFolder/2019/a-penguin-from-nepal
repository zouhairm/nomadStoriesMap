Text: "His first wife took all his money and left him. His second wife committed suicide.\
  \ He wants to be married again, so we\u2019re trying to find him a third wife.\n\
  That was the essence of the story our tour guide was telling us about one of the\
  \ porters in our group on our first full day on the Annapurna Circuit in Nepal.\
  \ We\u2019d gotten past initial introductions and progressed directed to the complicated\
  \ love life of the friendly porter in the red t-shirt. \n\nThese details were spilling\
  \ out as we sat under a corrugated steel roof decorated with fading prayer flags\
  \ hiding ourselves from the late afternoon sun. In addition to our match making\
  \ tour guide, our group consisted of 14 tourists, seven porters and one yellow dog\
  \ who had joined up with us sometime after we had set off from Nayapool. \n\nAs\
  \ fascinating as the human romantic revelations were, I had fallen hard for the\
  \ dog. He was medium sized, had the soft, floppy ears of a yellow lab, but a narrower\
  \ snout. Common sense told me to stay away because like most men you pick up while\
  \ backpacking, he was probably riddled with fleas and a bad attitude if things didn\u2019\
  t go his way. \n\nBut there was something about him that drew me in. And frankly\
  \ he was cleaner than I was at that point.\n\nI named him Penguin. I didn\u2019\
  t say this out loud, he was still just \u201Cthe dog\u201D to everyone else, but\
  \ to me he was Penguin. This was the first name that popped into my mind and it\
  \ was too absurd to dismiss.\n\nAs we got closer to the village of Ghandruk where\
  \ we planned to stop for the night, the porters went ahead to drop off our bags\
  \ in the teahouse and I\u2019d lost sight of Penguin. \n\nA surprise was waiting\
  \ for me when I arrived. Not only was Penguin still in our ranks, he was sprawled\
  \ out asleep in front of my door. The porters had put our luggage into our assigned\
  \ rooms, and Penguin must have followed my scent. I was charmed by his loyalty.\
  \ \n\nLater that night when I was getting ready for bed, another trekker knocked\
  \ on my window. Penguin, who had left his original spot after confirming that I\u2019\
  d made it safely to the teahouse, had returned to my door and was curled up in a\
  \ circle outside, my personal guard dog for the night. I slid open the window, handed\
  \ my camera to the other trekker and she took one of my all-time favorite photos:\
  \ me leaning out a window grinning ear to ear, while my new love caught some Zzz\u2019\
  s next to a pair of hiking boots too smelly to bring inside.\n\nThe next day\u2019\
  s trail led us down a steep valley, across a river and up the other side of the\
  \ valley. A sturdy metal bridge led across the river. After I crossed to the other\
  \ side and looked back, I realized the all of the humans in my pack had made it,\
  \ but Penguin was standing frozen, a few steps past the entrance on the opposite\
  \ side. I turned around, crossed the bridge again, scooped up Penguin in my arms\
  \ (who, God bless him, was not the lightest dog I\u2019ve ever carried) and brought\
  \ him safely to the other side.\n\nNow it was Penguin\u2019s turn to have his heart\
  \ burst with love, prancing around and wagging his tale as fast as he could. He\
  \ was filled with bravado and a few minutes later when some lazy oxen meandered\
  \ across the trail, Penguin chased them away to protect us. He continued on, running\
  \ down the trail and that was the last I ever saw of him.\n\nTwo days later our\
  \ group arrived at Dhampus and our guide had a message for me. He\u2019d spotted\
  \ Penguin on a leash outside a nearby house. The owners told him Penguin was their\
  \ pet, but he\u2019d been missing for a few days, no doubt having the adventure\
  \ of a lifetime.\n\nPenguin: if you\u2019re reading this, I still think about you\
  \ and I hope you think about me, too."
