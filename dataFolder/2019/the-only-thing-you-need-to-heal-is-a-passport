Text: "One year had passed since my father past away, one year that seemed to me not\
  \ enough time to embrace the pain of that loss. I decided to travel in a way I\xB4\
  ve never traveled before, a trip that could connect me with my father and my true\
  \ self.\nBuying the ticket and making time for it was easy, I followed my heart\
  \ and it  led me to the airport, the difficult thing was to know that I had to open\
  \ that drawer of mixed dark and scary feelings , my worst nightmare and memories\
  \ of my dad \xB4s illness, feelings that  I have had closed for one entire year.\
  \ Including the sourest feeling of all: PAIN. \n\nMy destination: El Camino de Santiago.\
  \ \n\nWalking 25 km per day, discovering and connecting with nature and culture\
  \ in a way I\u2019ve never done before; and following for 6 days straights the signs\
  \ to the right path, was the most pure experience of INNER SILENCE that I\u2019\
  ve ever had, It gets to a point that you don\u2019t even listen to yourself, I became\
  \ listening the voice of my father guiding me and telling me things he did even\
  \ knew how to express in life. \nAll the means to connect with him were there, music\
  \ the principal one. I took the music that I\xB4ve listened for 1 week straight\
  \ at his side the very last days of my dad\xB4s life. \n\nNature, adventure, great\
  \ food, wine, laughs, great company, discovering new places new people and physical\
  \ exhaustion. But, like I said before, going through the silence following the signs\
  \ to the right path, made my soul to heal in a way that I cannot even explain. If\
  \ you saw me you could think \u201Cthis girl is going to kill herself in no time\u201D\
  \ tears and tears rolled through my face and my clothes, the best metaphor that\
  \ I can think of to explain it is : like a water balloon that had been punched ,\
  \ the water been the pain of loss and the balloon feeling of connecting with him\
  \ closer and closer. Facing my reality and re connecting with my dad in a new way\u2026\
  . like I connect with god, you feel his presence, listen his voice, but he is still\
  \ not there. \nI took this trip to be with him again, just us, and to let him guide\
  \ me and feeling him close to me. \nThe highlight of my camino was the very last\
  \ day, the tallest and widest trees around me, inspired me to let him know that\
  \ this was my last day in which I would have full silence to listen to what he wanted\
  \ me to hear. In was in that moment that an song of my favorite artist started playing\
  \ that I didn\u2019t recognize, I immediately looked down to see the title of the\
  \ song and it said \u201Cwhen the time comes that I have to leave you\u201D \nIt\
  \ seemed like a joke, but the lyrics of that song were truly the words of my father,\
  \ his way of telling me I AM HERE AND I AM TALKING TO YOU: \u201C I wish I had more\
  \ time to see your dreams come true, God\xB4s timing is perfect, I know is hard\
  \ to understand, stop crying, he will take care of me, you were my happiness till\
  \ the end, don\u2019t feel sad, I\u2019ll never forget you,  I am inside your soul,\
  \ never forget me, take care of your life, take care of it wisely, wherever you\
  \ are I will be there by your side, stop crying,  I know one day will see each other\
  \ again. \u201C \nThere it was\u2026  the moment that I have cured my storm of pain.\
  \ That moment I felt free of it. The moment that I beat my worst nightmare.  \n\
  For me, Travel is investing on me, every place I go it becomes a part of myself.\n\
  \nMy destination: Camino de Santiago  \nWhat I learned: the only thing you need\
  \ to heal is a passport :)"
