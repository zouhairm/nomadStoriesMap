Text: "The Indian Ocean comprises of many creatures and species that one can never\
  \ see from the surface. In the deep waters, lie treasures, from both ship wrecks\
  \ and of marine life. \n\nThe southern part of Bali, near the Nusa Dua resort area,\
  \ is home to such treasures too. After a lot of water sports and beach activities\
  \ offered by The Grand Mirage resort, my cousins and I decided to bow down to the\
  \ great ocean and learn a thing or two about it. \u201CI\u2019ve to go Scuba Diving,\
  \ no matter what! It\u2019s on my bucket list\u201D, my 14 year old brother remarked.\
  \ \L\u201CSure, let\u2019s see.\u201D I responded.\n\u201CDi, you\u2019re chicken.\
  \ You\u2019ll chicken out, you always do. While the 4 of us will complete it.\u201D\
  \ \LSomewhere, I knew it was the truth. I\u2019d always chicken out. When you\u2019\
  re the eldest, you\u2019re always scared that the responsibility of rash actions\
  \ will fall on you, no matter the fact that you had no say in the decision making.\
  \ \n\n\u201CLet\u2019s do it.\u201D I said with extreme conviction on my countenance,\
  \ and extreme terror in my heart. \n\nFrom the resort, we were taken on a jet boat\
  \ to another part of the beach, where we had to change into our diving gears. I\
  \ wont lie. Changing into clothes that felt like complete rubber was more than amusing;\
  \ it was also difficult. The wetsuit socks make you feel like an incomplete mermaid.\
  \ You have double fins for feet but a gas tank instead of gills. \n\nWe waddled\
  \ like ducks to the boat and were taken to the middle of the Ocean by the professionals.\
  \ We were explained a few lingos. For example, to go back up, one was to show their\
  \ thumb and point upwards. Before diving in to the deep waters, we practiced on\
  \ the surface. Breathing underwater with a mask and a tank made us feel more alien\
  \ than martians. \n\nI was getting cold feet. I wanted to see the beauty I\u2019\
  d always seen in movies, experience in actuality the fishes I\u2019d just visualised,\
  \ and feel the ocean on my skin like I\u2019d never before. \nWe jumped into the\
  \ Ocean and practiced for 10 minutes more. I was scared to my core, but I wanted\
  \ to finish the task nevertheless. Maybe, this was courage. Doing something regardless\
  \ of how terrified you feel. \n\nThe diver now took us to the deep underwater. I\
  \ struggled for a long time for I experienced extreme pain in my ear. I went up\
  \ like 5-6 times and then.. I stopped. I asked myself, \u201CBhavya, do you not\
  \ want to see the beauty in this ocean? You\u2019re halfway there. You want to leave\
  \ this incomplete as well?\u201D And, for once, my negative self talk gave way to\
  \ a positive me. I said no under my weird mask and went all the way in. I left the\
  \ hand of my instructor and felt as if I was flying in the ocean. I felt free. I\
  \ felt brave. I did a cartwheel and I laughed.\n\nI saw Klein Butterfish and felt\
  \ them nibble on my skin while I fed them bread. It\u2019s very hard for a person\
  \ who wears spectacles to wear diving goggles and be okay with the fact that most\
  \ of the Ocean is blurry and one can mistake something dangerous for something extraordinarily\
  \ cute. But, without my sense of sight, I felt more. And I would never exchange\
  \ that feeling for a perfect sight. \n\nAfter being in the depth of the blue for\
  \ a very short time, I felt like I could do anything. Like I could conquer the world.\
  \ \n\nWe came out and everyone was talking about me. But I couldn\u2019t care less.\
  \ For what I\u2019d just experience, I wanted it to stay with me for as long as\
  \ possible. Linger in my mind, for as long as I\u2019m alive. I found a treasure\
  \ too."
