Text: "Food is the first thing that comes to mind whenever I pin a place to travel.\
  \ In March 2015, I managed to combine a work trip with my travel to Bangkok and\
  \ so, I was going to be in Thailand for two months. As a rule, wherever I travel,\
  \ I make sure I gorge on local food as much as possible. Not surprisingly, the day\
  \ I landed I decided to consume only Thai choices for the entire period.\n\nWe were\
  \ shooting in a bungalow in the Ongkharak district of Bangkok. The film crew was\
  \ a mix of Indian and Thai people. As the lunch break was announced, Indians queued\
  \ up for Indian food stalls while Thais queued up for the Thai stalls. A few Indians\
  \ were in the Thai queue, I was one of them. The Thai caterer looked little surprised\
  \ yet curious which quickly changed to annoyance when he saw some of the Indians\
  \ not only being picky about the Thai food but also making faces at the flavours.\
  \ By the time it was my turn, he was angry and blabbering in disappointment to the\
  \ production manager.  He said something to me rather sternly in Thai which I, obviously,\
  \ couldn\u2019t understand. A colleague behind me translated it for me. The Caterer,\
  \ sarcastically, wanted to know what I would pick from the spread to which I said,\
  \ \u201CEverything!\u201D. The colleague translated back for the caterer and instantly,\
  \ his anger changed back to surprise & curiosity. I took everything and grabbed\
  \ a chair close by. The way I was gobbling food, not just the caterer, his wife\
  \ and daughter too looked on, wide eyed. Even my Indian counterparts were surprised\
  \ at how I could adjust to that taste. Little did they know that every night after\
  \ finishing my work around 10 PM, I would step out to eat and try out anything that\
  \ was local. I was loving any part of any animal as long as the flavours were Thai.\
  \ This became a blissful ritual.\n\nMeanwhile, the catering family grew fond of\
  \ me, just by observing me imitating their food habits and eat their food their\
  \ way. We didn\u2019t know each other\u2019s language but the gestures of hi, hello\
  \ & thank you were more than enough to carry the relationship.\n\nOne day, I reached\
  \ the catering area during lunch break and was caught by surprise. There were no\
  \ Indians at the Thai stalls. I spotted a placard on the stall which said \u2013\
  \ \u2018Thai Food For Thai Crew Only\u2019. The Indian crew began teasing me pre-empting\
  \ my disappointment on seeing the placard. I tried catching the caterers\u2019 attention\
  \ but the entire family was busy putting food on the stalls. With my shoulders drooped,\
  \ I quietly queued up for the Indian food. Though the Indian food was good as well,\
  \ but I disliked being forced to violate the rule I had made for myself.\n\nWhile\
  \ I was still getting taunts from my fellow Indians and trying to make peace with\
  \ my destiny, someone tapped on my back. It was the Thai caterer. With a very characteristic\
  \ smile on his face, he pulled me out of the queue and led me to a table where a\
  \ bowlful of rice and some chicken preparation poured over it was placed for me.\
  \ I felt really touched & grateful at that moment and we shared a look, a look which\
  \ needed no words, in that look we understood each other. I turned to look at the\
  \ family; they were all smiles, too. The caterer gestured & asked me to go for the\
  \ food. While he left to take care of his stall; I ate with pride, gratitude & a\
  \ smile in my heart. \n\nI wanted to express to him my feelings despite the language\
  \ barrier. As I walked to the stall, the caterer and his wife came forward. I bowed\
  \ a bit and said \u201CKha Pun Kha\u201D \u2013 a negligible bit of Thai that I\
  \ knew. The caterer pointed 1PM in his wristwatch to me and gestured \u2018tomorrow\u2019\
  . I nodded in yes and left satisfied. I made a local friend that day with whom I\
  \ didn\u2019t need to talk and we shared & recognised our common passion."
