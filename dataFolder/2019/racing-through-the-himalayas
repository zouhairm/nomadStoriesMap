Text: "Sheets of melting snow slide from the warming galvanized roof, while mule and\
  \ yak stomp and shake free from the last white chill of yesterday\u2019s storm.\
  \ The mountains beside us are a carpet of powder and above us, only blue. Our guides\
  \ are making way ahead of the group to the next dig site, while we weary volunteers\
  \ meet the achy morning with exhausted mouthfuls of steadily thinning air. Packs\
  \ packed, we set out after them, to add our foreign footprints in the fresh flakes\
  \ of this virgin trail nestled in the frosted beauty of Nepal\u2019s Langtang Valley.\n\
  \nIn the grips of something primal, an unspoken race begins. I quicken my pace to\
  \ a run, heart banging like a war drum, to see just how close I can feel to the\
  \ feral forefathers who first forged this hoof-trodden path cutting stream, tree\
  \ and boulder. Bounding from rock to root, I scarcely notice that I have passed,\
  \ one by one, alien and local alike. Only one is left ahead; Pemba, our lead Sherpa.\
  \ As he falls to my flank, there is an exchange. Our eyes lock for a instant. A\
  \ nod to note that I must go on, and a smile of disbelief; I am the first outsider\
  \ to make a leg of the familiar route before him, and so I continue, open path before\
  \ me, stomping space until none can be seen behind, yet faster and faster, neither\
  \ chasing nor being chased, but obeying an ancient call my former city life subdued\
  \ to slumber.\n\nTruly, it is a sobering sensation, halting my labored lope at the\
  \ palpable wall before me: silence. Deafening, soul-stumbling silence. No wind through\
  \ the rhododendron, the dew dripping from each icicle hushed in the cushion of fresh\
  \ drift. Not a sound from those behind, not a stir of the life housed in this savage\
  \ range. The low din of nothing comes as a ghostly prayer from the untamed men who\
  \ have stood as I am now: alone in the wild. Deeply, eye\u2019s shut, I breathe\
  \ in their breath, their plea to carry with me back to the shackles of our busy\
  \ world of progress. A message: it\u2019s not enough to live when you can truly\
  \ feel alive.\n\nA few hours later, the team reunites at our next stop. We pulverize\
  \ stone, to ruble, to dust, clearing away the foundations of what used to be a school\
  \ before the great quake of \u201815. Our hands hummed in the harmony of labor,\
  \ shoulder to shoulder, tourist and townsmen united in our effort to replace the\
  \ clanks of hammers with the ruckus of kids kidding around. I feel a new and more\
  \ sacred bond with the strangers I have come to love as family. The proximity of\
  \ shared toil means more to me now that I know the consuming joy of a solitary pursuit,\
  \ free, where not even sound could catch me. That stillness still ringing in my\
  \ ears, through the cacophony of grunts, laughs, and sighs; a necessary chorus in\
  \ bringing Komin Shyamey Secondary back to life. \n\nThe sun disappearing behind\
  \ the ivory-capped summits signals our day is done. While I am watching the team\
  \ pant and awe at Himalayan majesty, Pemba pulls me aside. He holds me at arms length\
  \ with a force complimenting the sincerity in his eyes, and says nothing. Just searches\
  \ my face. He sees it; that place of change. Like any volunteer, I have come to\
  \ give, but he sees in my eyes what I have taken: an understanding of why, no matter\
  \ the weight on his back, nor the gradient of incline, Pemba runs first, alone,\
  \ always. We shake hands as equals who have reached a peak from which, there is\
  \ no return journey, and join the others circled around the tea hearth, smelling\
  \ sweetly the benefits of modern man\u2019s community."
