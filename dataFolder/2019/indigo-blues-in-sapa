Text: "Dawn breaks as the van snakes around the mountain faces of Northwest Vietnam.\
  \ In the pale blue light, we can see children in traditional garb heading to schools\
  \ perched precariously atop cliffs. IPods peek out from their bright green head\
  \ wraps as they walk past traditional H\u2019mong houses with no windows or floors,\
  \ flanked by vats of indigo dye and buffalo pens. \n\nMy wife and I hold hands as\
  \ the van bounces into Sapa, the Alpine city populated by Vietnam\u2019s ethnic\
  \ minorities. It\u2019s our first time in Asia since our pre-baby trip three years\
  \ ago. As the sun peers through evergreen branches, we are both aware that this\
  \ trip is a sunset on our unsuccessful attempts to get pregnant.\n\nThe H\u2019\
  mong language is different from Vietnamese. Vietnamese gurgles in vocal eddies and\
  \ spills over the tongues of speakers like the great rivers that cut through the\
  \ country\u2019s lowlands flow to the sea. In Sapa City, flocks of women clad in\
  \ indigo tunics chirp to each other in a language that sounds like the birds flitting\
  \ through the crisp mountain air. \n\nWe have come to Sapa to hike through the valleys\
  \ of terraced rice fields shadowed by Fan Xi Pan Mountain. We meet with our trekking\
  \ guide, G\xF2m, a young women with a jet black ponytail streaked with blonde highlights.\
  \ She is wearing traditional H\u2019mong calf guards and a neon pink North Face\
  \ jacket.\n\nOn a clear day like today, the farms serpentine over the slopes until\
  \ they are out of sight. G\xF2m\u2019s first question to us, the first question\
  \ everyone in Vietnam asks, is how old we are. The second question is if we are\
  \ married. There is a brief moment of confusion when we say that we are married\
  \ to each other, but she doesn\u2019t ask any clarifying questions. Here in Sapa,\
  \ like in rest of the country, our relationship is surprising but not offensive.\
  \ \n\nG\xF2m is 25 and married a boy from her village after a traditional bride-kidnapping\
  \ ritual. He takes care of their two daughters in the village of Lao Chai while\
  \ G\xF2m leads trekkers through her ancestral home. After a simple lunch of c\xF3\
  m g\xE0 \u2013 chicken rice \u2013 G\xF2m invites us to rest in the house where\
  \ she grew up. Her father built the house, and her eldest brother inherited it on\
  \ his wedding day. Sitting under the single electric light in the three-room house,\
  \ G\xF2m regales us with stories of her daughters\u2019 adventures growing up in\
  \ the same place as their mother. I watch her baby nephew play on the dirt floor\
  \ of the house that would someday be his and allow myself to sit with the sadness\
  \ that we will never know the feeling of passing down traditions.\n\nThe wind turns\
  \ the fronds of the bamboo forest into paper streamers as we wobble over rocks behind\
  \ surefooted G\xF2m. She finally asks us the third question that builds the foundation\
  \ of every conversation we\u2019ve had in Vietnam: do we want children? I steel\
  \ myself and say that we have tried, but it is hard. Assuming the details of fertility\
  \ treatments for gay women are beyond G\xF2m\u2019s comprehension of the world,\
  \ I don\u2019t try to explain, but she surprises me by asking, \u201CDoes the doctor\
  \ get you pregnant? Is it very expensive?\u201D I\u2019m taken aback by my own honesty\
  \ as I reply, \u201CYes. We\u2019ve tried seven times. The doctors say we should\
  \ stop trying.\u201D\n\nG\xF2m stops walking suddenly and turns around to face me.\
  \ In a forest opening overlooking bamboo stalks sliding into the valley mist, she\
  \ takes tight hold of my forearms. Looking intently into my eyes, she whispers,\
  \ \u201CI cannot imagine how hard that must be.\u201D Her candor and her empathy\
  \ hit me hard in the gut. In this moment, the deep understanding that transcends\
  \ culture and language and country dislodges a part of my pain. In this moment,\
  \ G\xF2m is giving me permission to grieve. Later that night, in our homestay with\
  \ other trekkers, she makes sure I am not grieving alone: she pulls out a two-liter\
  \ bottle of homemade \u201Chappy water\u201D. We shout, \u201Cm\u1ED9t, hai, ba...\
  \ d\xF4!\u201D and drink to nothing in particular. We drink to nothing together."
