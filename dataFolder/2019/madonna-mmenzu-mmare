Text: "Even if Italy has been unified since 1861 the historical differences between\
  \ north and south are deeply-seated in the culture of the people, especially in\
  \ those small villages where old practices and superstitions are part of the daily\
  \ routine. \n\nGiovanni, born and raised in the multicultural Bologna, led by the\
  \ idea that you have to know your home country before throwing yourself into the\
  \ world, bought some train tickets to discover his own land.\n\nRegion by region,\
  \ he discovered the strangest, typical words, the tastiest gastronomy and the richest\
  \ cultural heritage. Despite the number of findings, he didn\u2019t realize the\
  \ importance of religious traditions before arriving in Puglia. He ended up in Castro\
  \ Marina, a village that links the countryside to the coastline. \n\nHe noticed\
  \ how each house was painted by a different bright color. They resembled the typical\
  \ ones of Murano, a small fishing island near Venice. \n\nWhile the sun was fading\
  \ the buildings projected long shadows that, along with the silence of the streets,\
  \ made him believe that he was being catapulted in one of De Chirico\u2019s paintings.\
  \ \n\nThe crickets\u2019 call was now broken by the joyful shout of children playing\
  \ in the streets and by the call of the mothers compelling them to return home.\
  \ \n\nHe then realized how the villagers scrutinized his figure: they were wary\
  \ but meddling, as that village hardly saw foreigners through its streets. \n\n\
  That night he decided to hit the bar at the main square, place of excellent socialization\
  \ in every little village in Italy. Refreshed by the salty breeze, Giovanni took\
  \ an amaro and started conversing with one old man probably done playing cards with\
  \ his fellow companions.\n\u201CGood evening sir! What a nice one, isn\u2019t it?\u201D\
  \nThe old man implied a smile. \n\u201CI\u2019m Giovanni, I\u2019m here for vacation.\u201D\
  \ The boy wasn\u2019t sure whether to continue the conversation or not. \u201CI\
  \ was looking for a typical tavern, do you have some recommendations?\u201D asked\
  \ the boy. He knew that food always was the best ice breaker. \n\u201CSo you are\
  \ the foreigner guy in the city! Nice to meet you, young boy, I\u2019m Aldo.\u201D\
  \nThey shook hands. Aldo, Giovanni discovered, was not as old as he thought. He\
  \ was \u201Cjust\u201D 64 and he still dedicated his life to fishing. He was very\
  \ tanned and his skin strong and immune to sunburn. Wrinkled tired hands witnessed\
  \ a life of hard work.\n\u201CSo you all are aware of who I am.\u201D\n\u201CWell,\
  \ we\u2019re in a small village, the news always travels fast\u201D. They both laughed\
  \ \n\u201CSo, I\u2019m here to discover traditions, not only culinary of course.\
  \ Is there anything you can tell me about Castro Marina?\u201D Giovanni wanted to\
  \ find something unique.\n\u201CYou actually came at the best time of the year for\
  \ that. In two days there will be the Festa della Madonna di Pompei. It\u2019s the\
  \ most heartfelt event in the community\u201D\nFesta della Madonna di Pompei, he\
  \ discovered, is a very important religious event:\na procession will pass through\
  \ the silent streets of the city where the statue of Madonna del Santuario is carried\
  \ by local fishermen to the ancient harbor, a Mass is celebrated and the walk continues\
  \ at the seaside, fully decorated with lighting boats and garlands. As a final act,\
  \ the statue is arranged on a large illuminated boat that will navigate through\
  \ the bay, inside the natural caves. \n\nHe could have never imagined how a big\
  \ event it was; he saw how the city was fully\ncommitted. Previously during his\
  \ trip, he\u2019d never found such a strong feeling that links all people, from\
  \ kids to old people. It seems that time at the Castro Marina stopped 60 years ago.\
  \ Not only the architecture of that place but also for how people behaved: only\
  \ local dialect was spoken, children\u2019s life wasn\u2019t contaminated by technology\
  \ and religion was practically considered a social duty. In that small world, Church\
  \ was where people regularly reunited and religious events, like the one he had\
  \ the chance to live, truly helped to build and maintain the community altogether.\
  \ The unique treasure that he was seeking, in the end, revealed to be the importance\
  \ of traditions, religious or not, that people pass down."
