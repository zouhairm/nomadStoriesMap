Text: "The snow covered my heavy winter boots up to my ankles and a freezing cold\
  \ filtered through the joints of a frayed scarf that tried to protect my nose. I\
  \ don\u2019t remember exactly how many clothes I was wearing that night, but I was\
  \ sure it was enough to cushion a fall caused by the ice, or my clumsiness.\n\n\
  While walking, I desperately tried to warm my hands with my breath. Apparently,\
  \ my wool gloves had failed in their effort to keep their natural color, now purple.\n\
  \nTime passed, and in front of me my expedition partners, \"the Mexicans,\" kept\
  \ their eyes on the sky; expectant, impatient, curious and occasionally disappointed,\
  \ tired and aching, wishing more than ever a comfortable bed and a cup of hot chocolate.\n\
  \nEight hours of cold and darkness had passed; at that point, the pain in my numb\
  \ feet and burned cheeks was becoming unbearable. I did not tell, but I felt guilty\
  \ for taking them in that pursuit completely blind, alone, without a map or guide,\
  \ without knowing if what we were treading while walking was soil, pavement, or\
  \ perhaps a frozen lake that would transform our nordic adventure in a tragic newspaper\
  \ headline.\n\nAll that time I had the feeling that we were where everything finishes,\
  \ and that later on, we would see nothing but mountains and polar ice caps. If the\
  \ earth were flat, our location on the map would be right on the edge of the precipice.\
  \ Everyone calls it Troms\xF8, but for me, it was the end of the world.\n\nWith\
  \ no one around us, not a single soul attempting to face the harshness of winter,\
  \ we were only three girls at -25\xBAC and 9000 km from home hoping something extraordinary\
  \ would shake our lives. Having come this far, it was n\u2019t time to give up.\n\
  \nThus, our stubbornness kept us walking until we reached a vast field surrounded\
  \ by trees, we had gone so far away from the road that the sound of the cars had\
  \ become almost imperceptible, and instead, the wind shuddering the leaves of the\
  \ pines and the silence of nothingness, overwhelming and intimidating.\n\nWe were\
  \ about to flee in panic when we heard Iris, the youngest of the group, whose shout\
  \ of excitement broke the sepulchral silence.\n\n-They are here!-\n\nA faint grayish\
  \ light was painted on the clear sky; confused we followed it as it began to intensify\
  \ its color and extend its length. It's hard to try to find something you've never\
  \ seen, but my intuition told me that we had not traveled more than 5000 miles in\
  \ vain.\n\nThe halo of gray light began to turn green and move like a serpentine\
  \ dodging the wind; others appeared next to it, and in seconds a whirlwind of color\
  \ lighted the celestial vault.\n\nAn adrenaline rush ran down my spine; it was like\
  \ falling from the highest peak of a roller coaster. I had no doubts, we had found\
  \ them. The lights from the north had come to see us and danced about our heads\
  \ like graceful and delicate ballerinas. They touched the mountain, as the legends\
  \ of the Sami tribes said and I ... I had lost my speech.\n\nI stopped feeling cold;\
  \ I really could not feel my body, either. For the first time no thought crossed\
  \ my mind, no person came from my memory, only a genuine feeling of authentic gratitude,\
  \ fullness, and greatness. I also remember that I realized I could cry of happiness,\
  \ touched by that gift of nature, suspicious that something so magical could be\
  \ real, satisfied that we accomplished the mission. We hugged and waited until the\
  \ sky released the last flash of light.\n\nFour years have passed since that encounter\
  \ with the northern lights, and every time I close my eyes, I still can see myself\
  \ in that frozen cemetery that stopped being scary and became the perfect complement\
  \ to the most unreal experience I have ever had.\n\nMany times I\xB4ve been asked\
  \ what has been the happiest moment of my life; my answer is always the same: a\
  \ perfect moment, in the right place, a cold winter night in Norway, at the end\
  \ of the world."
