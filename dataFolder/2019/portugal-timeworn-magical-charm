Text: "\"People don't take trips, trips take people.\" Travel to me is all about rejuvenation\
  \ and learning. \n\nSo recently I went to chandigarh for my college competition\
  \ for four days after which we had to leave for Delhi. But instead of coming back\
  \ , I hopped on a bus to travel solo back a few days in Dharamshala (hill station\
  \ in Himachal , India). A little scarced but excited I thought WTF, am I crazy to\
  \ be doing this? Because I have never travelled alone in my life.\n But in the course\
  \ of next hour I became extra vigilant of my surroundings and suspicious of random\
  \ people who glanced at me as soon as I stepped on bus stand. It was 9p.m and there\
  \ was no taxi around because in hill station 9p.m is bit late. I was frightened\
  \ but somehow I managed to get some taxi after interacting with the locals after\
  \ which I reached my hotel. \n\nNext morning keeping my fear aside it dawned on\
  \ me that I was about to embark on one of the greatest adventures of my life and\
  \ I should make the most of it. In that instant , my excitement ate my fear and\
  \ I was ready to conquer all the beautiful places.\nOn day one I visited I planned\
  \ a half day tour which included tea garden, war memorial park, bhag dunga water\
  \ falls. And then I had spent the 2nd day for trek which was 10- 15 km ahead of\
  \ Dharamshala. And I still remember that I have not seen such a steep slope ever\
  \ in my life. It was really hard to make grip on snow but still I  managed to reach\
  \ the sunset point. It was one of most mesmerizing site I had ever seen in my life.\
  \ After completing my evening snack , I returned to bus stand and with heavy heart\
  \ left for Delhi. It did turn out to be one of best trips , even though it was little\
  \ short. \n\nEach of these moments are ingrained in my hearts as fond memories and\
  \ experiences.And as they say, \"Life is not measured by the breaths we take, but\
  \ the moments that our breath away.\"\nBeing an architecture student I always look\
  \ forward to such trips which nurtures your soul, and you get to know so much about\
  \ the culture , traditions of that place.\nNow it's time for Portugal!!! ( I hope\
  \ so\U0001F622)"
