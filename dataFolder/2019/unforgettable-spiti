Text: "\u201CMy heart will always belong here\u201D, I murmured before we started\
  \ our journey back from Chandrataal to Manali. \nRiding through the less explored\
  \ mountains of Spiti valley, my journey never ended and while writing this, I am\
  \ still in the desert mountains of this Middle Land between India and Tibet, as\
  \ short of words to describe the unmatchable serene beauty as I was while on the\
  \ back of Himalayan Bike as a pillion absorbing every landscape through this 800\
  \ Km journey from Manali to Chandrataal and back. \nThe regions close to border\
  \ are as beautiful as heated and intense, and often targets for political propaganda\
  \ but mankind here knows no fight, no hatred, no agendas. This valley reflected\
  \ warmth in less than ten degrees Celsius from all sides and welcomed us to befriend\
  \ and connect with Mother Nature. While every local here is reserved yet helpful,\
  \ their greetings saying Julay! while we waved them back to say hello and connected\
  \ with smiles and affection oozing from every bit of thin air, those voices still\
  \ bring a smile on this stressed face of metro life. \nThe valley was not only deadly\
  \ but also so enchanting that I ended up dangling my feet at the mountain edges\
  \ halts en route Manali to Lossar on very first day, the longest ride for 13 hours\
  \ that made our back, buns and everything sore! Rohtang pass was a bling with tourists\
  \ enjoying tea and bhuttaa (corn) and further route offered challenges for all riders\
  \ at every curvaceous turn with bikes kissing the ground and raising our beats until\
  \ we started loving the thrill. Off-roading is not for the faint-hearted. It made\
  \ us feel achieved every time we made through gravels, rocks, mini-to-big-riverbeds,\
  \ and other ardous challenges that burnt the tyres and quite often, set our souls\
  \ on fire. After we stopped by at kunzum la at 4550 feet and prayed at Kunzum Mata\
  \ temple \u2013 a three dome structure adorned in yellow, blue, red and white (wondering\
  \ how beautiful it looks when snow-clad during winter in -30 degrees Celsius), we\
  \ were unstoppable till Lossar, our first stop for a homestay. It is fascinating\
  \ how small mountain tops utilize space and make up a cozy guest house with hotel\
  \ service and the best part being interaction with locals for hours. We ended our\
  \ evening with rum and pahadi, Punjabi and nepali songs. \nSipping strong ginger\
  \ tea with bread-butter, we started our day riding towards Dhankar Monastery, our\
  \ next homestay. The terrain was rockier and we passed under young mountains that\
  \ were prone to landslides. Dhankar Gompa stood as a fort-like structure still mirroring\
  \ the ancient traditional capital of Spiti occupied by its rulers and judges. \n\
  The next day led us to Tabo Monastery, most calm place I have ever visited for prayers.\
  \ It greets people will a cool breeze in shadowed interiors, dark yet lit, a perfect\
  \ balance of light to see and touch the carvings of Om Ma Ni Padme Hum and dark\
  \ enough to enjoy solace amidst monks chanting the prayers and tourists wondering\
  \ about the calmness of this place and internalizing their initial experience with\
  \ Buddhism. \nPassing through the Pin valley, we headed towards Kaza, that which\
  \ hosts the highest post office and highest petrol pump in the world, which I would\
  \ describe as an urban village of Spiti with steep roads crowded by people walking\
  \ through shops on right and left, offering visitors to buy their ethnic clothing,\
  \ souveneirs, liquor, thentuk and thukpa to eat, sheesha and some hustle after spending\
  \ time in solitude for days. \nKaza to Chandrataal was the chilliest road with the\
  \ most beautiful scenic landscapes and we can still map out Chicham bridge in our\
  \ memories. The site at Chandrataal was a township in the middle of mountains with\
  \ deluxe tents, servicemen and a cosmopolitan tourist crowd under a Blanket of constellations\
  \ and glittering Milky Way. We sang through God\u2019s creation of this planet.\
  \ The last spot was a picture I would never forget, of the Half Moon Lake \u2013\
  \ Chandrataal! We were too engrossed to head back but it was then time to wave Bye,\
  \ See you soon, again! to this beautiful Indo-Tibetian region of Lahaul-Spiti."
