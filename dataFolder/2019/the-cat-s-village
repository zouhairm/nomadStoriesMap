Text: "The wending machine dropped down a soggy sandwich just as I heard the flutter\
  \ of the boards changing. I looked eagerly, only to find another 20 minutes added.\n\
  \nThis was my first tryst with an Italian train strike. Most people would think\
  \ themselves lucky to be stranded at the train station in fascinating Florence,\
  \ but this was not one of those days. It was grey, dull and wet. I longed for the\
  \ train that would take me to Trebiano, or as my airbnb host dubbed it as \"the\
  \ cat's village.\" \n\nBut instead of petting cats and walking under stoney arches\
  \ on a hillside, I was sitting cold, miserable, hungry and anxiously waiting for\
  \ my train that was already 3 hours and 10 minutes late. The worse bit was not having\
  \ any wifi to message my host to tell her about the delay, since she was picking\
  \ me up.\n\nSo hours later, I didn't even dare count how many, I rejoiced as I found\
  \ myself exiting the train at a sunny little Sarzana. It was a small station and\
  \ the only way to get to the street would be via the underground access. So after\
  \ that dreadful journey, I had to lug my 25 kilo bag down a series a stairs. That\
  \ was the easy bit of course, the real challenge was dragging it up on the other\
  \ side of the station. Oh well...\n\nJust as I braced myself to carry it up, two\
  \ tiny hands reached for my bag and a string of Italian followed. I tried to brush\
  \ them away, saying no thanks to the elderly man who tried to help. I've had the\
  \ same thing happen to me at Indian railway stations with the \"coolies\" or luggage\
  \ porters. But on closer look, I saw that this was a woman. So I thanked her in\
  \ my very limited Italian and starting dragging my bag. And then my ears picked\
  \ the words \"airbnb\" and what I could only assume was my name in an Italian accent.\
  \ This short, tiny lady with the salt and pepper hair who didn't seem to speak a\
  \ lick of English was my host, Laura.\n\nI immediately tried to explain the strike\
  \ and apologise for my tardiness, but of course she didn't understand a thing. I\
  \ followed Laura to a little beat up red car and we were soon off to the cat village,\
  \ which from prior googling I knew was a 25 minute drive away. But not even four\
  \ minutes into the drive, she made an abrupt stop and excitedly wrote \"ice cream?\"\
  \ on her google translate app while motioning to a gelato shop. Moments later, we\
  \ both were sitting in her car, quietly, but noisily slurping on some berry flavoured\
  \ gelato at golden hour. I liked this woman already.  \n\nWe finally made it to\
  \ Trebiano. Two cats lazily greeted me as I stepped out. Another sat in a window,\
  \ judging me. A mere three minute walk and about six other cats later, Laura unlocked\
  \ a big door and ushered me in. The place was stunning. I was supposed to have a\
  \ single room in this 3 bedroom house but it was a slow week so I had the entire\
  \ place to myself! Laura handed me a bottle of wine and I read \"1 hour, dinner\
  \ time. I pick you\" on her phone before she almost waltzed off. \n\nI watched the\
  \ sun set slowly, while sipping on red wine from my balcony. A cat lay across the\
  \ adjacent rooftop. We exchanged looks. It yawned and looked away. Rainy Florence\
  \ already seemed like a lifetime ago. \n\nI took my time, then got ready for dinner.\
  \ Shortly, Laura knocked at the door. She then took me a few houses over, to her\
  \ own place where she introduced me to her friend who was joining us for dinner\
  \ and who I soon learned was our translator for the night. Over her homemade spaghetti\
  \ and marinara sauce and some more wine, I grew fond of this sweet old lady and\
  \ a strong friendship blossomed. We still couldn't manage to have an exchange of\
  \ words without the aid of her app or her friend, but that didn't seem to matter."
