Text: "On a wet and windy night i found myself watching Rick Stein on BBC and he was\
  \ in Bordeaux and it looks like a beautiful city i think to myself. I enjoy the\
  \ show but the rest of the week I am really struck at how much the views of Bordeaux\
  \ have piqued my curiosity . \nBeing newly single and not having many friends in\
  \ the new city I have just moved to I was a little apprehensive of actually travelling\
  \ on my own. I asked my daughter but she was too busy with her university course.\
  \ \nAfter years of missing adventures,  I was learning to enjoy my own company wouldn't\
  \ this be the same just in France? \nI found exceptionally reasonable flights with\
  \ Easy Jet for a little 3 day break, which i thought would be not too long but then\
  \ not to short and I would get to see Bordeaux and get a feel of the city. \nI choose\
  \ to stay in an Airbnb  in a little town that was 35/40 mins from Bordeaux itself.\
  \ It was about 10 minute walk from the train station which was \nIn the middle of\
  \ wine country and had a little patio outside for enjoying the morning which in\
  \ September was absolutely glorious. If you have every lived in the UK a day with\
  \ out rain is a welcomed break . \nOn to Bordeaux itself. a beautiful city with\
  \ great winding streets and back alleys to get lost in. On my first day I didn't\
  \ make any plans I just decided to walk around and enjoy the sights. I went to Bordeaux\
  \ Cathedral which is beautiful, and exceptionally quiet which I found incredibly\
  \ peaceful . another place to visit was the Pont de Pierre \"Stone Bridge\" It connects\
  \ the left bank of the Garonne River. Fantastic views of the city as you walk along\
  \ the bridge.  My last stop for day one Place De La Bourse  Bordeaux's most known\
  \ landmarks. It is listed on the UNESCO World Heritage. I would highly recommend\
  \ seeing these as you can really see the beauty and elegance of Bordeaux.\nOn my\
  \ Second day I decided it would be silly to not check out the Wine Museum in Bordeaux\
  \ . Not only is it an impressive building, its a great way to actually learn more\
  \ about wine if you have a general interest, you can also have a few cheeky taste\
  \ testers there. I didn't have huge expectations as i had no idea what a museum\
  \ of wine would be like, it was one of the most enjoyable museums I have been to.\
  \  On my way back to the Airbnb I stopped and got some wine of course and a few\
  \ bits from some of the markets I had stumbled on. \nMy third day took me out of\
  \ Bordeaux completely the trains in Bordeaux are so easy to use and there are so\
  \ many nice places to have a day trip to. I chose Arcachon which is on the seafront.\
  \ Lovely place to enjoy some sunshine a nice walk and some delicious seafood. Also\
  \ little cafes to enjoy a beer or coffee outside. \nFor my first solo journey Bordeaux\
  \ was perfect. Lots to keep me occupied and so many sights to choose from to enjoy.\
  \ I felt incredibly safe there and didn't have any issues whatsoever. I would recommend\
  \ it highly to anyone and especially solo women travelers. This was the first of\
  \ my many solo adventures. At first yes it's scary traveling on your own but there's\
  \ something so liberating about exploring a city on your own ."
