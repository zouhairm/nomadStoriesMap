Text: "Portugal was bolder than Scotland. The people were more exuberant; the supermarket\
  \ queues less orderly. Even the colours were more vibrant than the muted tones at\
  \ home. The cliffs of the Algarve flaunted layers of red rock and different shades\
  \ of bright blue swirled together under the waves. \nIt was my first experience\
  \ of a family holiday in the sun. I couldn\u2019t quite get over the idea of wind\
  \ being warm. Heated like a hairdryer, almost? At that young age I didn\u2019t have\
  \ much else to compare it to. Even on the rarer days of sun in Scotland, wind was\
  \ anything but warm.\n\nThis breeze was mixed with spray from the sea \u2013 fresh\
  \ and salty. It lifted my hair as I leaned over the side of our rickety wooden boat\
  \ and peered into the water as we weaved along the coast.  As a family we sat balanced\
  \ out across the weathered seats to counter the buffeting waves. Our boat was smaller\
  \ than most, but the boatman skimmed it closer to the side of the cliffs and it\
  \ sat comfortably low in the water. We didn\u2019t talk much other than to comment\
  \ on how clear the water was. The undulating seaweed and anemones looked like silk\
  \ against the rough stones. Fish with names I didn\u2019t know darted about in slick\
  \ formations.  Not a single silvery sliver seemed out of place in the shoal. \n\n\
  Maybe it was something about all those sardines ganged together that did it, that\
  \ burrowed into my feeling of simple loneliness. A sense of dread rose up, flat\
  \ and ugly, and settled at the bottom on my stomach, worming into my sides. Sitting\
  \ in that small boat, in that moment it didn\u2019t matter where I was. It didn\u2019\
  t matter that the return to school was weeks away. All that mattered was the vastness\
  \ of a lunch break with no one to sit next to. The panic of walking between classes\
  \ desperate not to be seen, not to be cornered. Determined to relax, I was managing\
  \ to do anything but. Even now, with experience and time bridging a gap between\
  \ that moment, the anger of being trapped in my own head still feels sharp. \n\n\
  My eyes prickled with frustration. I kept my face angled away from my parents. Slumping\
  \ slightly lower on my seat, I wished I was alone and began to calculate how long\
  \ until I would be. The boat turned around a column of rock into a secluded cove.\
  \ Clusters of people were spread out across the sand under the baking sun like toast\
  \ crumbs in butter. An older man, nimble on the sharp rocks, was clambering near\
  \ our boat. He caught my attention and I turned to look closer. Something didn\u2019\
  t look quite right. I couldn\u2019t work out what was wrong with his swimwear? A\
  \ small and furry, grey triangle. \n\n\u201CIs that \u2013 \u201C\n\nI stopped myself.\
  \ He dived into the sea. My Dad blustered. \n\nNothing could be more British than\
  \ the way my Dad \u2013 with sun cream still dolloped on the end of his nose \u2013\
  \ tried to explain nudist beaches to an 11-year-old. I turned to my Mum who even\
  \ then had mastered the parental knack of appearing to have all the answers.\n\n\
  \u201CIn other countries people have different ways of going to the beach than we\
  \ do at home and, well, sometimes it involves not wearing any clothes. But don\u2019\
  t stare like that it\u2019s not polite.\u201D \n\nI sat back into the side of the\
  \ boat and laughed. I could still see the balding head bobbing leisurely along the\
  \ shoreline as the boatman steered us on. School seemed a lot further away than\
  \ it had done moments before. I stared out across the water. The sun pushed down\
  \ defiantly and for a moment I didn\u2019t see or think about anything other than\
  \ the overwhelming blueness of Portugal. I didn\u2019t expect to find that moment\
  \ of solace in the absence of swimwear. My eyes still squinting at the sunlight\
  \ dancing on the sea, I turned my head slightly towards my Mum.\n\n\u201CPeople\
  \ have different ways of relaxing I guess?\""
