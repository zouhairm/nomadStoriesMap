Text: "Vintage Houses, thick density of Muslim conservatives and a bag full of dreams.\
  \ Lived all my life in a rather comfortable, westernised and an Arabic  setting,\
  \ moving to a house full of relatives for my higher studies was exciting nonetheless.It\
  \ was just the family that I had in mind, five hours after my arrival, and two hours\
  \ across the street, I knew I was in a for a whirlwind.\nKuttichira, a small town\
  \ in Calicut, adjoining the city and the beach, is where my ancestors thrived as\
  \ merchants and landlords. It\u2019s history goes way back, as the Arabs set foot\
  \ for trade and the ruler provides land for them to make families, where my eighth-grade\
  \ cousin showed me the town and majestic Miskal Mosque. What surprised me was, we\
  \ had Parsi and Gujarati neighbours that were family. The architecture student in\
  \ me took over and before I realised, the homes were a maze that I walked into.\
  \ With over fifteen rooms, and impressive wood designs, and the rooms overlooking\
  \ a courtyard, it was definitely a sight to see. \nFour years now, as I move to\
  \ the north and to the south of India, Kuttichira has always felt like home. The\
  \ mystery and history I\u2019ve shared, and the connections I felt as I travelled\
  \ across the south, as I hunt along the streets of ancient trade, I want to discover\
  \ and get lost in the future and at whatever the town has to offer."
