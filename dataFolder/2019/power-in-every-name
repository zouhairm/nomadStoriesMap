Text: "Power in Every Name. \n\nTallship sailor. Humans pause, respond: You mean you\
  \ work on a ship that is tall? Or assume waitress on cruise liner - further from\
  \ truth. Reference \"Pirates of the Caribbean\". The ship steering \u2013 bless\
  \ her sunken soul - was a star. HMS Bounty hosted Marlin Brando and his film crew\
  \ with historic tales of insurrection: \"Mutiny on the Bounty\" - filmed in Tahiti.\
  \ A successful mutiny. \n\nArrived in Old San Juan come summertime, duffel bag and\
  \ five dollars in my pocket -  my savings spent on plane tickets. Attempted to settle\
  \ in the Bay Area, became increasingly restless. \u201COnce a sailor, always a sailor\u201D\
  .  Spent those dollars on Mojito with my crew-mates at a bar near the dock. \n\n\
  Two co-ed crew quarters on Bounty. Tossing belonging in an upper bunk, received\
  \ a tour. Second Mate told me proudly: Only been 11 fires in the past 10 years!\
  \  Concealed  a smile  - over 1 fire/year. Next came deck training: describe in\
  \ character to tourists occurrences on the original HMS Bounty. \n\nThe HM Armed\
  \ Vessel Bounty, deployed by the British Royal Navy for botanical missions, sailed\
  \ to Tahiti under command of William Bligh to harvest a Breadfruit: used to feed\
  \ plantation slaves - benefited empires overseas.\n\n\u201CUnrivaled  in color,\
  \ texture and weight-\nBreadfruit is just cause to celebrate!\nGlories draw empires\
  \ from lands overseas-\nsetting sail in search of Colonial Remedies.\nSo tempting\
  \ its prospects, so pleasant its care,\nbetween local women, no ship can compare!\n\
  Its spherical plumpness and promise of Bounty\ndrew Botanists and Sailors from every\
  \ county!\nAlas! Darling Breadfruit - in your historic play- \nYou catalyzed events\
  \ which are famous today.\u201D\n\nDaily work on Bounty was restorative - a double-hulled\
  \ recreational film vessel modeled after an original British Navy Vessel. The designer\
  \ was carpenter not shipwright so there were numerous problems  even when docked.\
  \ Tarring rigging 100\u2019 above deck was my preference - we shared all tasks equally.\
  \ Our work was seldom appreciated. \n\nWoke every morning to swab decks  \u2013\
  \ next, crew meetings. The ship took on water - less than ideal if sailing from\
  \ Puerto Rico to East Coast. In an upper bunk, seeping rain and sea water. Black\
  \ mold accumulated - every cabin. Rotating schedule  - we pumped out the engine\
  \ room 3x/day; bilge-diving was common.\n\nThe engine room was confusing. On Bounty\
  \ crew worked together on operations, teaching one-another. On weekends off we rented\
  \ a car - visited the local rainforest El Yunque. The sound of Coquis calling was\
  \ compensation for a week of rigorous work.\n\nCoqui: thus named for the sound.\
  \ Small rainforest frog. While mating, calling distinctly and constantly \u201C\
  Coqui! Coqui\u201D! We joked about these beautiful creatures - pretending they were\
  \ waking us with \u201CCoffee! Coffee!\u201D - anticipating long work days humans\
  \ and frogs alike understand.\n\nOld Carpenter was aboard. Visiting El Yunque he\
  \ was first to dive from waterfalls into natural springs below. I feared for his\
  \ life - he knew his strength. We passed many small villages on travels, one featuring\
  \ a unique billboard \u201COYSTERSCONDOMS\u201D. A streetside business like that\
  \ exists?!?\n\nOne night we finished work onboard - attempted to retire to dinner\
  \ on the Tween Deck. Damp conditions onboard encouraged roaches to procreate in\
  \ the interior . Walking through flying missiles was nightmarish. Eventually we\
  \ abandoned ship for 3 days while professionals bug-bombed. Our Galley never smelled\
  \ the same.\n\nTensions mounted as restoration and touring season wound down. Many\
  \ aboard nervous  - the HMS Bounty was not fit. Simultaneously, sailors were restless\
  \ with dockside and tourism work. Bounty fit for Atlantic travel?!? mentioned such.\
  \ Some listened, others called me \u201CWitch\u201D. I took temporary leave to attend\
  \ a wedding, hoping to rejoin after successful crossing.\n\nThis crossing never\
  \ took place. The HMS Bounty sunk in the Atlantic Ocean in Hurricane Sandy while\
  \ I was in the Midwest. Numerous were severely injured, 2 lost at sea. Desire to\
  \ sail and a lack of judgement led to destruction. Original HMS Bounty endured successful\
  \ mutiny - subsequently burned. Replica vessel endured mutiny of milder nature -\
  \ sank nonetheless. \n\nPower in Every Name. \n\nFor information on the HMS Bounty\
