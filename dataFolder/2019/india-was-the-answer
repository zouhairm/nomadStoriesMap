Text: "This story begins one winter night, when a cosmic spirit, an angel or the subconscious\
  \ mind told me something out loud that would change my view of life forever. \n\n\
  As my then girlfriend was laid down in bed, asleep, i was having a hard time catching\
  \ my dreams. Then i heard it,  \"REMEMBER WHO YOU ARE\", said my  sleeping partner\
  \ with a very sutil voice coming from her lips. She then proceded to question me\
  \ about my name, my favorite color and my heart. Finally she said \"Your roots will\
  \ move west\".\n\nFast forward and two months later i was done with life (i wasn't\
  \ unhappy but i felt i was traveling the wrong path), then decided to quit my job\
  \ and travel to India to become a yoga teacher and like Julia Roberts in the film\
  \ adaptation of Eat, Pray, Love (silly reference i know!), i was making a leap of\
  \ faith into the unknown, i was trying to REMEMBER WHO I WAS. Who i was before getting\
  \ a job, before getting into that relationship i didn't called into my life, before\
  \ staying put in one place and not asking myself what i wanted from life and if\
  \ i was happy.\n\nI didn't told you before but I love doing yoga! Spiritual yoga\
  \ practice and asanas changed my life when i was broken and lost after leaving medical\
  \ school, and i was broken yet again. I loved everything around the western sense\
  \ of  \"yoga\" and inevitably after some years of practice i wanted to become a\
  \ Teacher and spread the love i felt when i was broke, i wanted to become me again\
  \ and maybe in the way help others.\n\nI aknowledge This Was It, this was my opportunity\
  \ to pursue what my heart longed for and what my spiritual voices told me to do\
  \ so, this was the time to remember Who I Was! So i took a leap of faith into the\
  \ unknown, i booked a flight for a 2 month long trip from M\xE9xico to India, grabbed\
  \ my backpack, took my camera and left.\n\nI remember arriving to Delhi on an early\
  \ morning in September, it was monsoon season and the feeling in my body was that\
  \ of a wet summer morning (in a good way i mean), it felt like water mist was running\
  \ through my skin, as those drops of fresh water sliding from the grass and flowers\
  \ in early summer mornings. I took a long breath and proceded to take a bus that\
  \ would take me up north of India, i was going to Bhagsunag, an Himalayan town known\
  \ for the bohemian yoga scene and it's closeness to McLeodganj the Home of the Dalia\
  \ Lama and the Tibetan Government in exhile. I choose this place because in my mind\
  \ it was an open door waiting for me patiently, wide open as i fled from my western\
  \ capitalist life, whiling to receive me as it received those who have fled before,\
  \ tibetans and people pursuing the same thing alike, Freedom.\n\nAnd there i was,\
  \ in Upper Bhagsu, a mind blowing, heart melting and breath taking hill station.\
  \ A mountain height full of blooming nature, enormous trees and your typical everywhere\
  \ indian cow. I arrived at a lovely home devoted to teach yoga after walking up\
  \ the peculiar streets and pathways made of stepping stones and stairs carved into\
  \ the himalayan forest. In this place i met some of the wildest hearts, i met some\
  \ of the most kind souls and some of the most lovely humans. There is something\
  \ about the Himalayas, and about India in general that, just a certain kind of people\
  \ makes it through the \"ugly\", \"the under-developed\", \"the mess\" and experiences\
  \ all its colors, all its sounds and flavors and sights, all the 'Bliss'.\n\nI had\
  \ the opportunity to see this town for one whole month, i had the opportunity to\
  \ saw the tibetan monks taking a deep into the temple pool filled with waters coming\
  \ from the hills and the pouring monsoon. I had the opportunity to see the blending\
  \ of cultures and colors of the tibetan and indian people, i had the opportunity\
  \ to Remember Who I Was."
