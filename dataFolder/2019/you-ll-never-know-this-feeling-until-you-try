Text: "My story begin at 2016 year when I took the decision to go abroad, cause i\
  \ needed a change in my life. \nI was totally broke, totally bankrupt and a total\
  \ mess. So i just decide to take the first plane to Cyprus after New Year and to\
  \ spend 6 months volunteering.\nThe idea sounded so wonderful that i didn't  imagine\
  \ what consequences this would have inside me.\nWhen I arrived a woman from the\
  \ hosting organization took me from the bus station and drove me to the house that\
  \ all of 8 people (1 boy and 7 girls from different countries) will live together.\
  \ It was Sunday so everybody was doing something around or in the house. I went\
  \ in to my room that was really small, with one double bed that i shared with my\
  \ Romanian roommate, one window and a wardrobe. The first week was a disaster for\
  \ me. I was crying and thinking that a half of year i will not succeed to finished.\
  \ I wanted to take the plane to my way back, but then i saw in my roomie, the closest\
  \ friend that I've met from long time ago. So we start hanging out, laughing all\
  \ night, spending time together, sharing gossips and sharing the freedom and the\
  \ amazing places on that island. And the months were passing by... I met a guy who\
  \ take care of me when i get sick, gave me his car when i wanted to drive a car\
  \ without lessons on the highway (and a policeman caught us,but the story ends with\
  \ laugh), took me at my first Cyprus football match and after that in to the farm\
  \ of his closest friend where i hold a baby pig in my arms..and i was happy. \n\
  And one day, one sunny Easter day i received a call from Bulgarian airline company\
  \ for a job. For a cabin crew member. And I was... Oh, My God! My dream came true.\
  \ But the problem that i had 3 months more until my project to end. And if i wanted\
  \ to leave i should refund all the money for my accommodation, food and e.c. I couldn't\
  \ afford it ,so i \"create\" an accident in my family and  I pretended that i should\
  \ go back to take care of them. It was a long procedure ,but in the end i found\
  \ my place and my dream job and i was thankful about this experience, which made\
  \ me stronger and push me in to another adventure in Tunisia, which i will tell\
  \ you net time :)\nRegards, Andrea"
