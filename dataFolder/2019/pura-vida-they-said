Text: "As someone who was born and raised in a planned city from the Pampas - or else,\
  \ a chess board spread on flat argentinian land - there is something about the up-and-down\
  \ walks of mountain towns that dazzles me. When I moved to Costa Rica for the summer,\
  \ it took me a while to get used to not running out of breath while making my way\
  \ from the Foundation where I volunteered to the bus stop, several blocks up further.\
  \ Now I was jogging as four tiny sweaty hands pulled me forward and two more pushed\
  \ my back.\n\n\u201CIt went right there, teacher, I saw it!\u201D\n\u201CYes, teacher,\
  \ he saw it!\u201D\n\nThe boys squealed all at the same time as they guided me unbeatable\
  \ across the huge palm leaves of the backyard and up the old asphalt road. The youngest\
  \ one implored that we hurried while beating the rusty fence against the orange\
  \ blossoms that filled the hot summer air with its scent. They stopped sharply before\
  \ an enormous gray wall. Behind it, I knew for I could see it from the bus stop,\
  \ there was one of those modern curtain wall skyscrapers that seemed even more foreign\
  \ to the neighbourhood than myself. I rang the bell. A metallic husky voice answered\
  \ me from the intercom.\n\n\u201CYes?\u201D\n\u201CWell\u2026 hello. I work in the\
  \ Foundation down the street.\u201D Six supplicant eyes stared at me anxiously.\
  \ \u201CYou see, the boys were playing football\u2026 and they\u2019re pretty sure\
  \ their ball flew to your garage.\u201D\n\u201CYes, sir! Please- Our ball! I saw\
  \ it- He saw it, sir! Please!\u201D, they all shouted at the same time.\n\nSilence.\
  \ Some minutes passed before the disembodied metallic voice came back only to say:\
  \ \n\n\u201CNo balls here.\u201D\n\nSo it seems, I thought to myself turning to\
  \ the boys, who I expected would be disappointed. The oldest shrugged.\n\n\u201C\
  Pura vida!\u201D, he exclaimed. \u201CLet\u2019s borrow my cousin\u2019s. C\u2019\
  mon, teacher!\u201D\n\nThey ran down the street laughing their heads off. From where\
  \ I was standing I could see their houses just across the river. I was not supposed\
  \ to go there alone, it was a dangerous neighbourhood - so said the media, my host\
  \ family and everyone else. But the boys were waiting for me with glittering eyes\
  \ and expecting me to look after them just as much as I knew they would keep me\
  \ safe. Isn\u2019t that how you keep danger at bay? So I chased them.\n\nWe ran\
  \ beneath the orange trees, we ran until the old asphalt road became a narrow lane\
  \ and our sneakers lifted dust, and then we ran some more between the delicate arrayans\
  \ and the tall breadfruits. We crossed the wooden bridge and we dived in a parallel\
  \ city of cramped colourful houses of sheet metal rooftops. Walls were brightly\
  \ painted, flower pots were hanging from the windows, doors were open and locals\
  \ were sitting outside looking at their children play in the streets. At seeing\
  \ me, they would raise their hands smiling and call me teacher.\n\n\u201CPura vida,\
  \ teacher!\u201D\n\nPura vida in Spanish means something like pure life. Ticos say\
  \ it at all times to express their laidback attitude towards life. While I waited\
  \ for the boys to come back, I took a deep breath. The sun was hiding behind the\
  \ mountain and poured its golden light on the neighbourhood. I let the light, the\
  \ colours, the laughter and the warm summer breeze sink in. Somehow, I was home."
