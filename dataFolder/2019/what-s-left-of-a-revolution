Text: "It all started with a visit, on a Friday morning, in the Pink Mosque of Shiraz\
  \ - south of Iran. Famous for its colourful morning lights, this Mosque attracts\
  \ a lot of people Who come from the whole country (and world) to take pictures and\
  \ feel there instagram feed, as it is, in Iran, an unexpectedly popular social network.\
  \ \n  As we went out and were trying to get a taxi through Snapp - the local cheap\
  \ version of Uber - we heard screams and an argument started. We turned around and\
  \ three girls, we had briefly met in the Mosque before were arguing with the entrance\
  \ keeper. One of the girl was answering to him, of course we didn\u2019t understand\
  \ but we could feel the tension as everybody was staring at them. At some point\
  \ - climax of the argument - she took off her hijab and left her hair down which\
  \ increased the screams of the guard. Soon after the two other girls did the same\
  \ and walked away, past us, proud\u2019y Heading for the street. We were astonished\
  \ by what we had just witnessed, as you must know, taking off your hijab in public\
  \ is severely punished by the law. Still highly surprised and talking about it we\
  \ headed for our taxi and saw the same girls getting in their car. We hesitated\
  \ but decided to go and talk to them.\n  We ventured a shy \u2018hi\u2019 - talking\
  \ to girls in Iran canbe a bit risky when you are two men - and explained them we\
  \ had just witnessed the scene but we didn\u2019t understand what happened. The\
  \ one who had taken her veil first replied in a clear English that the man at the\
  \ entrance had asked her to put her hijab back on, insulting her. She, of course\
  \ had replied and had triggered the argument. We expressed our admiration and how\
  \ bold and brave this gesture was for us. And casually they invited us to join them\
  \ for lunch. \n  There we were, in her car, talking about feminism and women\u2019\
  s protest actions in Iran. They told us there were sisters and were fighting for\
  \ women\u2019s right in Iran regularly at their university. One might seem surprised\
  \ reading this as we had barely met. You just need to bear in mind that Iranians\
  \ are extremely friendly and curious, yet it was the first time we had been invited\
  \ by girls.  \n  So we shared a lunch and despite the fact we wanted to pay for\
  \ they tricked us on our poor Farsi knowledge and paid for it. \n  And we decided\
  \ to spent the whole afternoon together and we headed for Hafez\u2019s mausoleum.\
  \ Sitting in the shade of an orange tree we talked about our lives, our studies,\
  \ our dreams, our goals in lives, comparing both societies and changing subjects\
  \ as a man passed by, just in case it would be a government spy. Because this is\
  \ how it is in Iran, life hangs on two levels, the official one and the personal\
  \ one. \n  Iran was one of my favourite trip abroad, not only for its amazing architecture\
  \ and landscapes, but also as its people bear something genuinely humane in their\
  \ attitude - something we sometimes seem to have lost in the \u2018so-called\u2019\
  \ western part of the world ( I do not like this expression but it is probably the\
  \ less segregating).\n  Today we are still in touch and we regularly talk through\
  \ whatsap. They have invited us to come back to Shiraz and we might do. When I think\
  \ back about it, seeing her shiny ginger hair flying out of the hijab, fiercely\
  \ staring at the entrance guard, I can\u2019t help feeling admiration for these\
  \ three girls and I truly that one day they will be able to let their hair down\
  \ freely in their country\u2019s streets."
