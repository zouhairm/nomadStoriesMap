Text: "The first - and only - time I took charge of planning our annual vacation,\
  \ I felt a swell of pride when I booked an Audi A3 Cabriolet - a convertible full\
  \ of swag - to cruise the stunning Californian coastline. I had handpicked our cozy\
  \ Airbnb apartment, \u2018conveniently located\u2019 near downtown San Francisco\
  \ in an area intriguingly called the Tenderloin. \n\nArty and full of history, this\
  \ funky neighborhood is situated on the edge of the Financial District. What the\
  \ guidebooks and our host had failed to mention was the abundance of drunks. Stepping\
  \ out of our shiny car, we were welcomed by an empty beer bottle, hurtling our way\
  \ and sailing past my right temple. And after a sleepless night, bombarded by screams\
  \ from the street, we agreed that this was not the kind of funky we\u2019d had in\
  \ mind for this trip.\n\nStill, the excitement of the Golden Gate city and all that\
  \ it has to offer won us over. An early queue for tickets to visit Alcatraz Island\
  \ was more than worth it, and also blessed us with a taste of the bitter winds the\
  \ Bay Area is famous for. The standard tourist activity in the name of hopping on\
  \ and off the cable car provided the perfect window to appreciate the sophistication\
  \ and aesthetic of the city. What\u2019s not to love?\n\nBut in the shadows, fleeting\
  \ glimpses kept slipping out of the corner of the eye. \n\nThey dressed in worn\
  \ and torn clothing, staggering from alley to alley, never really seen on the main\
  \ roads, in broad daylight. Yet their presence was impossible to miss, felt on nearly\
  \ every corner of every street. The homeless, the drunk, the junkies. The walking-tour\
  \ guide who led us from the City Hall to Grace Cathedral was indifferent. \u2018\
  Beyond hope,\u2019 he said with a shrug. Not a single taxpayer dollar should be\
  \ spent on those who had failed themselves.\n\nAs night fell, the obscure figures\
  \ woke up slowly from one nightmare to another while tourists, such as ourselves,\
  \ lived the high life. We dressed up, arrived at State Bird Provisions, an acclaimed\
  \ restaurant with a perpetual queue, and thoroughly enjoyed the culinary experience.\
  \ Satisfied with a full stomach, I proposed an easy 25-minute walk from Anza Vista\
  \ back to the Tenderloin. Caressed by chill but gentle breeze and drunk with happiness,\
  \ my love for traveling was once again reinforced.\n\nBut about 15 minutes into\
  \ our stroll, my boyfriend subtly started to pick up the pace (to my dismay; I was\
  \ wearing dainty five-inch stilettos). I tried my best to keep up, and only had\
  \ a chance for a breather when we hit traffic lights, alongside a group of hulks\
  \ beaming in their San Francisco 49ers jerseys, clearly emerging from a victorious\
  \ game. We were only a couple blocks from our rented flat when, suddenly, a young\
  \ girl across the street pressed her purse to her chest and sprinted from the mouth\
  \ of an alley. I saw no terrors lurking in the dark and dismissed her behavior as\
  \ peculiar.\n\n\nThe night\u2019s mystery bloomed, then receded as the dawn broke.\
  \ It was our last day and while I reluctantly packed my bag, my boyfriend, an ex-cop,\
  \ said with a solemn expression that a man armed with a knife had followed us during\
  \ our night walk. He recalled with rare nervousness how the grimy, sneaky pursuer\
  \ inched ever closer, silently. Only when we were merged with the throng of muscular\
  \ 49ers fans did he retreat.\n \nMy eyes widened in the narrow room \u2013 I heard,\
  \ saw and felt absolutely nothing. That fleeing girl, she wasn\u2019t peculiar.\
  \ She acutely feared for her life. \n\nTwo weeks later, in the comfort of our plush\
  \ leather sofa, I almost choked on my coffee over news of a man mugged, stabbed\
  \ and killed in San Francisco, along the route we took that haunting night. \n\n\
  The fun to be had and beauty to be admired in the city somehow highlights the contrast\
  \ between those who live a life of abundance and well, those who don\u2019t. Desperate\
  \ measures are taken at times, and what\u2019s to be lost? Certainly not food, wealth\
  \ or hope."
