Text: "I was chilling out at the rooftop of my hostel in Udaipur when I started hearing\
  \ a loud noise of drums coming down from the street. I immediately asked to the\
  \ waiter at the restaurant what was going on. He had no doubts. From the music he\
  \ knew they were celebrating a local wedding. He explained to me that they were\
  \ doing the \u201Cbaraat\u201D or groom\u2019s procession. \nShortly afterwards\
  \ I started seeing a parade made of hundreds of people and in the middle of it the\
  \ groom riding a decorated white horse. \n\u201CAre all of them guests of the wedding??\u201D\
  \ I asked.\n\u201CThey are just the guests from the groom\u2019s side! The bride\
  \ and her family are waiting for them at the reception venue\u201D. \nI had heard\
  \ that Indians were overly obsessed with marriage but personally seeing such a crowd\
  \ was really impressive. I went down on the street to join the parade of guests\
  \ that were dancing and singing front and back the groom\u2019s horse.\nEveryone\
  \ was wearing a special outfit for the occasion, especially the women who were dressed\
  \ with colourful and adorned typical customs.  \nFor the first time I was not perceiving\
  \ any sign of misery in the streets. Happiness and joy were going to reign the town\
  \ of Udaipur for the rest of the day.  \nI started to walk following the herd, curious\
  \ to find out where they were headed. I began to imagine myself ending up in a gigantic\
  \ palace with walls covered by spectacular mosaics and a large garden with a small\
  \ fountain in the middle, and a tiger that freely roams around it. Damn, I\u2019\
  ve watched Aladdin too many times!\nI tried to mingle with the crowd to pretend\
  \ to be part of the party, but I guess without too much success given my blonde\
  \ hair and my poor clothes more appropriate for a peregrination than for a wedding.\
  \ All right, I will not impress anyone with my outfit but I can still rely on my\
  \ sympathy. \nI began to dance with some of the guests, when suddenly someone threw\
  \ some money in the air just over my head causing a bunch of crazy children to jump\
  \ on me to pick up the banknotes that had fallen down. \nI was later explained that\
  \ they do it to symbolically remove the negatives for whoever you are blessing,\
  \ besides being a way to give money to someone needy. \nStill wondering if that\
  \ person wanted to bless me, bless the married couple or generously make me some\
  \ charity given my poor outfit. What I was sure about though, it\u2019s that I loved\
  \ to discover these small cultural elements that make Indian traditions deeply meaningful.\
  \ \nI was keeping walking and dancing in the street, when Farid who happened to\
  \ be the groom\u2019s brother stopped me and asked for my name. \nAfter exchanging\
  \ few words, he invited me to join them at the ceremony and to stay for the dinner\
  \ with the rest of the attendants. \nI couldn\u2019t believe it. I started to quickly\
  \ get excited and without thinking it twice I accepted the proposal. \nThe location\
  \ was really nice, although it was slightly different from Jasmin\u2019s palace.\
  \ \nThere was a big room where the food was served and which looked out over a big\
  \ yard. In the middle of the yard there was a stage where the lounge sofa for the\
  \ married couple was placed. \nI could probably have taken a photo with the spouses\
  \ sitting on the decorated lounge coach but for shyness I didn\u2019t dare to ask.\
  \ The bride was simply gorgeous with her stunning red wedding dress full of beading\
  \ and embroidery. She was always surrounded by other ladies same as a queen that\
  \ fairly deserves to be in the spotlight on her special day. \nThat night was a\
  \ really special one to me because I felt fully immersed into the Indian culture.\
  \ \nIt wasn\u2019t a simple funny night but my chance to live first-hand an Indian\
  \ tradition from a truly local\u2019s perspective!"
