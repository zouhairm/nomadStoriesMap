Text: "Bordeaux is the most beautiful place in the world. If you don\u2019t believe\
  \ me, sit out by le miroir d\u2019eau watching the Summer sunset. The reflection\
  \ of thick pastels on the water remains uninterrupted. The dozens of children playing\
  \ in the oranges, pinks, and purples cause not even an inconvenience to its beauty.\
  \ It\u2019s without a doubt the most crowded place when temperatures rise, and for\
  \ a good reason. I\u2019ve taken upwards of a hundred photos of this sunset, all\
  \ without successfully capturing its alluring charm. One day, I hope to. \n\nI studied\
  \ abroad in Bordeaux, France my junior year of university. Like many other UC students,\
  \ I knew I needed to get out of the American university system for a short while.\
  \ At least long enough to catch a breath of adventure before succumbing to post-grad\
  \ life. I like to believe that I ended up there by fate, others may say it was simply\
  \ chance. A lot of things had to go right for me to end up in Bordeaux. By whatever\
  \ miracle, that\u2019s exactly how it worked out. It was my first time ever traveling\
  \ alone, let alone my first time being somewhere so unfamiliar to myself. Uncomfortableness\
  \ became my new level of comfort. \n\nWindow shopping down Rue Saint Catherine with\
  \ the occasional pause to stop and admire street performers was part of my daily\
  \ routine after class. Tram line B went directly from my university to Victoire,\
  \ the heart of downtown. I may have missed my stop once or twice while on the Tram.\
  \ This was either due to my inability to make my way through the crowds entering\
  \ as soon as the doors would open or because I had my nose in Stephen King or Dean\
  \ Koontz. \n\nSometimes, I would sneak away from the world and lose myself in my\
  \ favorite bookstore. Rarely (but often enough to keep my hunger for literature\
  \ satisfied) I\u2019d treat myself to a new book. I\u2019ve since gotten a kindle\
  \ for my travels, but it hasn\u2019t been effective in keeping me away from exploring\
  \ every bookshop I encounter. \n\nI learned how to open a bottle of wine, how to\
  \ ride a bike while eating a chocolatine, and how to successfully maneuver myself\
  \ into Bordeaux\u2019s crowded tram during morning rush hour. I began starting conversations\
  \ with people in bars, initiating study groups in my morphologie course, reading\
  \ books that may have been far above my level in French at the time. I taught myself\
  \ how to stick up for my friends, but most importantly for myself. I found a lot\
  \ of amazing places in Bordeaux, some secret and some that I only wish the entire\
  \ world could see. Some of these places found me. Bordeaux had so much more in store\
  \ for me outside of vegan burger joints and dashing friperies. There\u2019s so much\
  \ more to find outside of wine tasting and cannel\xE9s and even outside of the buzzing\
  \ student life. \n\nI didn\u2019t know that I\u2019d find anything particularly\
  \ life-changing beyond a memorable year abroad in Bordeaux. I sure as hell didn\u2019\
  t know that I\u2019d find the confidence or courage that has stuck with me since.\
  \ The most surprising thing that I found? I found myself."
