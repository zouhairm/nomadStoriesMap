Text: "14 June 2016 started everything. The six months before that date were so long\
  \ and intense. \nI flew to Australia. Alone. A 16-year-old-girl, not a common girl\
  \ or a special one, just me, myself and books. \nIt took 27 hours to get there,\
  \ Brisbane. \nI was there. The most beautiful month in my life had just begun. \n\
  Andrea and Paul are grandpa\u2019s friends and I lived with them for the whole month\
  \ I\u2019ve spent in Australia.\nThe most grateful thing I\u2019ve seen were the\
  \ people. The people there have their own lives and therefore they won\u2019t and\
  \ they don\u2019t think about other\u2019s opinion. They live they way the prefer\
  \ to. No one wil criticise you just for the pants you wear or the shoes you like\
  \ the most or the haircut you\u2019ve dreamt about. \nIn Australia I\u2019ve learnt\
  \ to love myself, to give myself an opportunity in every situation, easy or difficult.\
  \ \nPaul and Andrea are my second grandparents. These 2 people have  changed my\
  \ life completely. \nI\u2019ve seen and swum in the Great Barrier Reef, I woke up\
  \ every morning feeling good and happy.\nSunrises and sunsets were the best. The\
  \ sun was up befor 5a.m and went down after almost 12 hours. \n1770 was the city\
  \ I lived in for a month. Mornings were obviously fascinating, the sun reflected\
  \ every time differntly on the ocean. It was limitless. \nI found out how to live\
  \ boundlessly and happily. The sea, or better the ocean, gave me such a quiet sensation\
  \ that I could have stopped the time I was living in. \nI loved it. I loved Australia\
  \ and all the people I knew, the places I visited and the way I changed my mind\
  \ in how I can see the whole world today.\nYes, I\u2019d like to come back, I want\
  \ to come back. I promised them. I have to.\nI came back to Italy. \n30 days were\
  \ gone. They lasted a blink of an eye but they are so far vivid. I can remember\
  \ everything of my journey. It was my journey. The first of many.\nAfter few months\
  \ another adventure came suddenly to my doors.\nI left Italy, my Padua. 9 Februar\
  \ 2018. This time the time I lived abroad was much more longer. 6 months away. Alone.\n\
  It was my challenge with myself. A challenge to prove everyone that I am able to\
  \ survive, a challenge to change myself again, to grow new skills and meet meny\
  \ different people.\nThe destination was not Australia or see places where I was\
  \ sure I could have lived good, Germany. It was Germany where I lived for 6 months\
  \ in order to learn the language and figure out much more things about me I could.\n\
  The truth is one: I\u2019ve learnt German as my mother tongue and I need to come\
  \ back. \nAt first, it was not simple at all. It was difficult, more difficult than\
  \ I have ever expected. I discovered and looked inside myself. \nI succeeded."
