Text: "A Leap into the Unknown\n\nSwollen ankles, fat toes and eyes wide opened I\
  \ stepped off the greyhound, to what I thought would be to some fresh air but instead\
  \ I was hit with the most dangerous wave of heat that swept around me like a duvet\
  \ on a California king bed! Luckily my father rescued me from the intensity and\
  \ despair with a golden water bottle.\n\nI noticed black men riding horses. If that\
  \ wasn\u2019t strange enough the horse began showing off by dancing and galloping\
  \ around as I caught my breath and gazed into the scenery, shocked that my friends\
  \ were right. A Jersey girl was now in Texas. What a thrill! \n\nMy dad asked, \u201C\
  Are you okay\u201D?  Before I could respond, he laughed and said, \u201Cthis weather\
  \ is like back home, relax you\u2019re okay.\u201D The home my father referenced\
  \ was not the jersey stoop I grew up but Monrovia, Liberia. He began telling me\
  \ stories about his tribulations as a child; that resembled the anxiety of my panic.\
  \ The one and only time in his fifty-six years of living that he drank liquor to\
  \ aid his starvation. Or like the time he walked twenty miles in the pouring rain\
  \ to go to school wearing shoes with newspaper inside the holes to protect his feet\
  \ from the rocks. He told me about another time where he graduated with honors but\
  \ no one in his family went to his graduation.\n \nStanding by finally cooling off\
  \ my dad and I had to get to campus. Out of nowhere this sexy guy walks up. Looking\
  \ away while still listening to my father, I prayed that my dad doesn\u2019t embarrass\
  \ me. How does the saying go \u201CMan plans and God laughs\u201D. That couldn\u2019\
  t be truer. In the time it took for me to trash my empty piece of heaven, my dad\
  \ was approaching the guy asking him for a ride towards campus. Surprisingly, he\
  \ obliged.\n\nHe took us to a nearby motel that would be close enough in case we\
  \ had to walk to get some food, however the only food place that was five miles\
  \ away was McDonalds. My dad\u2019s colleague was meeting us later to get notebooks\
  \ and supplies.  As we waited, we bonded more. Limited funds so penny pinching was\
  \ a necessity. After returning from hours of shopping, we noticed our food was gone\
  \ the room was clean and there was no snacks insight. \n\nNo transportation, just\
  \ dreadful hunger. In the morning my dad called his colleague again to see if he\
  \ would be able to come to our rescue, however no answer. Hours went by and still\
  \ emptiness. My dad knew I wouldn\u2019t be able to last much longer without some\
  \ substance. So against my better judgment he walked. The commute would have been\
  \ ten minutes in a car. All he had was love and a wet washcloth on his head to protect\
  \ him from the heat. Sadly, I couldn\u2019t give him one of my many hats because\
  \ my luggage was stolen along the way. \n\nFreshman year of college I was known\
  \ as the fashionable girl with the loving father, and I wore this as a badge of\
  \ honor. Seeing the lengths and the risk he would go for my education and life gave\
  \ me the fire and drive to make him proud. \n\nGaining this opportunity to go million\
  \ miles away to school with financial hardships was the honor I wore for myself.\
  \ I took a leap so that other women would not be afraid to explore and reach new\
  \ heights. Everything was against me but with my hero putting his pride aside to\
  \ save me, I felt like I was becoming his hero by living up to his \u201CAmerican\
  \ Dream\u201D."
