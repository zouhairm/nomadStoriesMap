Text: "I pursed my lips into the smallest \u2018O,\u2019 and took another swig from\
  \ the mini bottle of Chardonnay. I willed the white wine to muzzle my mind, which\
  \ had taken to repeating the sound of the redwood when it fell inches beyond my\
  \ rented red Ford Focus.\nBut this was no job for a mini bottle. When the ancient\
  \ tree fell, it was the crash of a dozen bears barrelling for me, crumpled and immobile\
  \ in the back seat. \nI texted my high school crush, my most recent Facebook connection,\
  \ of my near-fatal encounter. He didn\u2019t respond.\nI didn\u2019t text mom. I\
  \ couldn\u2019t. \u201CYou are the first of you girls to travel on her own,\u201D\
  \ she had said. In her late twenties, Mom had broken up with her boyfriend and taken\
  \ a three-month tour of Europe by herself. All careening toward thirty, my two sisters\
  \ and I had yet to travel anywhere without a parent or a man. But now, I hardly\
  \ had an excuse. I was now fiance-less and had just read \u201CWild.\u201D About\
  \ two weeks out, I booked the flight to Eureka in northern California.\nThe morning\
  \ after the tree fell, I turned off my cell sans messages and found my way to Bull\
  \ Creek South trail in Humboldt Redwoods State Park. I pointed my barely broken-in\
  \ hiking books toward the most isolated path. \nI plowed through the largest stand\
  \ of old-growth redwoods. After the first hour, the silence made me feel as if even\
  \ my footsteps were intruding, so I sat.\nThe quiet wasn\u2019t the desolate, aching\
  \ silence I had known atop the Grand Canyon South Rim. This was close, the gathered\
  \ hush of a church confessional. \nSurrounding me were the titans, lush and settled\
  \ in their temple blanketed below in redwood sorrel. The wind coming off the Eel\
  \ River bowed one redwood more than 300 feet high, and it creaked like the door\
  \ to an attic thick with old tales for which I had no language. They had survived.\
  \ Some of them bared black holes in their 20-foot bases that still smelled of the\
  \ fire that carved the cavern. The Girdled Tree showed freely the scar from where\
  \ its skin was stripped to make an exhibition in San Francisco. So to better reach\
  \ the sunlight, three trunks more than a thousand years old fused and twisted their\
  \ burnt copper bodies to the sky like a ballerina in a pirouette.  \nFrom my stump,\
  \ the hamster-wheel of my thoughts slowed. I noticed my thighs pulsing, the sweat\
  \ droplets forming on the back of my neck, the slight wheeze at the top and bottom\
  \ of my breath. There was still that feverish scar beating under my skin, the one\
  \ that told the truth: I knew he wasn\u2019t right in the first year, but I stayed\
  \ another five. A beastly hunger was capable of convincing me to go back if it meant\
  \ not being alone.\nBut there was something else now too, a smooth, hard pebble\
  \ inside my chest. I got myself here. I had been among the strange and deep beauty\
  \ of creatures old and strong. \nBack in the parking lot, my younger sister called\
  \ me from Florida where she was waiting for her Army boyfriend to return from deployment.\
  \ \u201CI\u2019ve got to give it to you, I\u2019d never go off in the woods alone,\u201D\
  \ she said. I sent my older sister, teetering toward divorce but too terrified to\
  \ sign the dotted line, a few pictures.   \nBefore I left, I stood on the edge of\
  \ the Lost Coast off Cape Mendocino in northern California. The rocky crags and\
  \ steep bluffs prevented developers from slicing the land into subdivisions, so\
  \ they deemed her lost. The sea thrashed my hair against my eyes and rough pebbles\
  \ cut into my feet. \nThe thing mom doesn\u2019t like to tell about her Europe story\
  \ is the ending. When she returned, she sought out that old boyfriend, who became\
  \ my father and her husband until the divorce 25 years later. After my flight, the\
  \ high school crush picked me up from the D.C. train station. From his car seat,\
  \ in my pocket, I rolled two smooth, gray pebbles from the Lost Coast between my\
  \ fingers."
