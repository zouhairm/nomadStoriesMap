Text: "The day started out like any other, perhaps lazier. We stayed at a hotel in\
  \ Lagos,  (all 5 Star Hotel in Nigeria), and we had to check out at 12. At around\
  \ 11am we decided to get showered.  I stripped off outside the wet room and closed\
  \ the door behind me. Next thing I knew I was standing in the bathroom with a doorknob\
  \ in my hand.\n\nKemi heard the noise and asked what was happening. We laughed until\
  \ she tried the handle on her side. Nothing.\n\nWe utilized our cutlery like locksmiths\
  \ hoping to crack it. I stood stark naked, not a towel in the room, asking Kemi\
  \ to fetch help. I thought this only happened in movies! She returned with a member\
  \ of staff and I was staring down the possibility of a Nigeria man opening the door\
  \ on me in all my glory like some sort of flashing nutcase!\n\nWhilst he hunted\
  \ for tools I asked Kemi to post me my pants. I jumped into them as the guy returned\
  \ to attack the lock again. He cracked it revealing me wearing nothing but my boxers\
  \ and a grin.\n\nThe lady did not know where to look. He ran and we still managed\
  \ to shower, pack and check out before 12 o\u2019clock."
