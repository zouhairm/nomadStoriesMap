Text: "Welcome Home\nAfter living for one year in Buenos Aires, Argentina, I decided\
  \ to go on vacation to my native province, Salta, better known as \"La Linda\" because\
  \ of its landscapes, but I chose a place little known: The Yungas.\nI traveled 140\
  \ kilometers, in bus, for 2 hours from the Capital of Salta to the town of San Jos\xE9\
  \ de Met\xE1n, to the southwest of the province.\nWhen I arrived, David, the guide,\
  \ a 50-year-old man with gray hair, soft brown eyes that contrasted with a rather\
  \ rough face, was waiting for me in a 4x4 truck that seemed to have fought a few\
  \ battles. \nHe received me with a gift: a survival bracelet: 5 meters of string,\
  \ a compass, a magnesium tip to make a fire at one end and a knife at the other\
  \ end (now I know what to answer when someone ask me what I would take if I were\
  \ trapped in an island) \nBy the time of the year (november) I was the only one\
  \ who had bought the trip, so it would be only him and me in this journey.\n\nIt\
  \ took my breath\nThe Youngas\u2019s ecosystem represents 1% of the surface of Argentina,\
  \ but it has 50% of the country's biodiversity. The landscape is majestic and I\
  \ feel tiny in such immensity.\nThe weather forecast determined rain most of the\
  \ days, and in that situation we cannot go too far because the vegetation keep the\
  \ land off the sun and it cannot dry quickly. It is strange how, sometimes, we want\
  \ to be doing nothing, but when that moment arrives we enter into despair. Or maybe\
  \ we enter into ourselves? It was cold in the middle of summer, the fog had erased\
  \ the mountains that surrounded us, and at night I had to place blankets over my\
  \ sleeping bag ... We had just to respect the time of nature, as David told me.\n\
  Luckily, nature did not make us wait so long, and the sun began to take place among\
  \ the clouds. The perfect climate for trekking to the top of the highest mountain\
  \ in the area: \"La Medialuna\", whose name proceeds from the road that must be\
  \ traveled to get there.\nThe final tract was difficult. The way was steep and narrow,\
  \ which gave an adrenaline touch to the adventure. \"Jesus protects the people of\
  \ Metan\" was written on the iron cross, along with other inscriptions of those\
  \ who passed by. We walked 7.33 kilometers in total, with 459 meters in vertical\
  \ drop. From the top we could see the borderline between Met\xE1n and Rosario de\
  \ La Frontera, another town in Salta. The photos and videos cannot be compared with\
  \ the wonder that my eyes saw and kept into my memory.\n \nNatural potential\nAdvantageously,\
  \ when I hired the trip asked David to visit the \"Hotel Termas\" in Rosario de\
  \ la Frontera, the border town that we had observed at the top of the mountain.\
  \ \nThe hotel was founded in 1880 by the Spanish doctor Antonio Palau, who could\
  \ see the healing potential of these thermal waters that occur in temperatures up\
  \ to 90 \xB0 on account of a ground deformation, where water is filtered from the\
  \ mountain , then emerge to the surface with a great power (although some people\
  \ believe that the reason is that the mountain, where we find these kind of water,\
  \ is, in fact, a volcano) The hotel is entirely provided by this water, which is\
  \ then cooled in giant pools and it is distributed to the different rooms, even\
  \ people can drink it.\n\nThe greatness of simple things\nThe space is small to\
  \ describe what this trip meant to me. Keep myself far away from external noises\
  \ made me listen to my inner voice. I was delighted with each conversation I had\
  \ with David, he is an entrepreneur and a visionary, who also takes care of his\
  \ community development and respect nature. He encouraged me to listen to my internal\
  \ voice and take a chance for what I want.\nNature did not cease to amaze me at\
  \ every moment and make me feel that greatness is in simple things."
