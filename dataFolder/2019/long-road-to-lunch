Text: "His eyes were black, and they were looking right at me.  We both knew what\
  \ this meant.  It was my turn.  \n\nAs an Australian visiting my girlfriend\u2019\
  s large Asian family in Kuala Lumpur, having travelled via Singapore and the ever\
  \ congested causeway and highways in between, I was tired.  The endless traffic,\
  \ constant weaving to avoid crater sized potholes, and the lingering taste of the\
  \ durian I had eaten for breakfast hadn\u2019t made the long journey seem any shorter.\
  \  \n\n\u201CThey have seen you\u201D whispered my girlfriend as the car came to\
  \ a stop.  In front of us was a large one story house with a tin roof.  Like the\
  \ scenery we \nhad just been looking at for hours from the car window, surrounding\
  \ the house was dark green grass and leafy trees.  Rain was plentiful here.   As\
  \ were the number of other guests.  All of whom were Asian.  I on the other hand,\
  \ was not.  \n\nEthnically divided, Malaysia and its people are used to difference.\
  \  For centuries they have lived alongside other customs and cultures.  The question\
  \ was, would they be able to accept a tall, skinny, hairy Australian?  The best\
  \ thing I could do would be to make a good first impression.\n\nWith that in mind,\
  \ I was now trying to remember the rules of the game I had just agreed to play.\
  \  \u201CYou can bet in Australian dollars\u201D an old lady exclaimed for the third\
  \ time in about 10 minutes.  The crowded living room I was now in once again filled\
  \ with raucous laughter.  Fortunately I had exchanged some Malaysian ringgit at\
  \ the airport.  I should have exchanged more.  \n\nThe mahjong table was a proving\
  \ ground of sorts, and was where I found myself that tropical January afternoon.\
  \  Hunched over the green felt table trying to decide which tiles to play, I was\
  \ still to learn that speed was the hallmark of a good player.   Nevertheless, with\
  \ a beer at my elbow, having just been delivered with a \u201Creserved for you\u201D\
  , I took a sip and rearranged my tiles. \n\nDisappointment was likely what my girlfriend\u2019\
  s father felt at that moment, as he continued to look in my direction, waiting.\
  \  Around five feet tall and weighing sixty kilograms he was by no means a big man,\
  \ however his quick movements and lively repartee immediately indicated a worthy\
  \ opponent.  It would have been foolish to underestimate him.  A bead of sweat trickled\
  \ down my cheek as I finally made my move.\n\nAs I sat there under the ceiling fan\
  \ listening to the click clack of tiles, and being completely outplayed, a yell\
  \ came from the back yard. It was time to prepare the rooster.  \n\nAs I\u2019d\
  \ stepped out of the car that morning I had seen him.  Tall with golden feathers\
  \ and a red crest, he had been tied by his ankle to the fence with a long piece\
  \ of string.  Unfortunately for him that was not where he had stayed.  As the women\
  \ had surrounded him there had been an excitement in the air.  He must have been\
  \ able to sense it. The reason, he could not have been sure.  But one thing was\
  \ certain, if there was any consolation, not a person at lunch that afternoon would\
  \ have argued that the rooster had died in vain.  H\u01CEoch\u012B!\n\nThe constant\
  \ chatter in Mandarin, the red and gold decorations adorning the house, the unfamiliar\
  \ yet enticing aroma\u2019s coming from the kitchen, and the taste of a cold beer,\
  \ I realised now the excitement of Chinese New Year.  And all this before the neighbours\
  \ had invited us next door to watch a dragon dance with accompanying drums and fireworks.\
  \  \n\nAs the noise of the drums faded, and the haze of smoke and gunpowder cleared,\
  \ I got the feeling I was being watched.  And there they were again.  Those black\
  \ eyes looking right at me.  What did he want now?  Another game?  He came towards\
  \ me and offered me his hand to shake.  It was a small hand with a firm grip, and\
  \ as he looked me in the eye he said \u201Ccome back next year\u201D.  We both smiled\
  \ as I said \u201Cok\u201D."
