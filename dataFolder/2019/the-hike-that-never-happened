Text: "Like immigrants arriving at Ellis Island, our legs wobbled as we walked off\
  \ the boat. Where I expected a \u201CWelcome to Ometepe\u201D sign, a chalkboard\
  \ read, \u201CAA \u2013 Every Sunday. Open Step MTG.\u201D Who comes to an island\
  \ in Lake Nicaragua because they have a liquor problem?\n\nThere are two reasons\
  \ foreigners board the sketchy-looking boat brimming with toilet paper, rice and\
  \ Corona. The first is a volcano. The second is a volcano. Concepcion and Maderas\
  \ are fraternal twins \u2013 best described as Lake Nicaragua\u2019s D-cup and C-cup.\
  \ Concepion is active. Maderas has been dormant for so long you can swim in the\
  \ crater lake in its mouth. My plan was to take a bus from town to the trailhead\
  \ where I could hike up Maderas.\n\nThey say if you want to make God laugh, tell\
  \ him your plans. Heaven roared with laughter that Sunday. Heck, it could still\
  \ be hiccupping.\n\nFor starters, the bus I\u2019d read about in my Moon Nicaragua\
  \ guide never came. Apparently on Domingo, its wheels don\u2019t go \u2018round\
  \ and \u2018round. Imagining the bus driver, feet up and sipping one of the Coronas\
  \ I\u2019d sat on during the voyage, I set off, on foot. My black Chacos were gray\
  \ with dust when I arrived at the  town's main square. A sign taped to a tree greeted\
  \ me. It was a giant piece of paper (like on those rolls at elementary schools).\
  \ In all-caps kidnapper handwriting, two words were written: \u201CTOURISM OFFICE.\u201D\
  \ It looked as professional as a child\u2019s summer sign. But instead of lemonade,\
  \ it advertised a \u201CLong Walk on Mysterious Path.\u201D That didn't sound like\
  \ a return trip to me.\n\nThere\u2019s a saying in Africa: \u201CThis is Africa.\u201D\
  \ These three words answer any exasperated traveler\u2019s question about why something\
  \ that works in the Western world is done backward, if even done at all. In the\
  \ weeks I\u2019d been traveling, I\u2019d been thinking \u201CThis is Nicaragua.\u201D\
  \ I\u2019d witnessed a wedding party dance around a live electrical wire draped\
  \ over a pool, paid 10 times as much as a Nica would for a pineapple and even tried\
  \ to work from an internet caf\xE9 with no internet.\n\nStill, I had faith my hike\
  \ would happen. My legs had already ascended Mombacho Volcano. At 1,344 meters,\
  \ Maderas was only 50 meters taller. What I forgot, however, is that I\u2019d started\
  \ at the base of Mombacho. Now, here I was: two hours and five miles later, still\
  \ walking along the side of the dusty road. I was halfway to the trailhead. My sweaty\
  \ feet were worn raw from the Chacos\u2019 straps. Any water I\u2019d packed was\
  \ sloshing around in my bladder.\n\nSome say \u201CWinners never quit and quitters\
  \ never win.\u201D I say \u201CQuit while you\u2019re ahead, not dead.\u201D  Not\
  \ wanting be stuck on a volcano at night, I decided to turn around. I\u2019d return\
  \ to town and free my feet from their brandname bondage. Miraculously, a truck pulled\
  \ over. The Nica driver asked if I wanted a ride. Nodding, I walked toward the cab.\
  \ Shaking his head, the driver motioned to the back.\n\nSince the beggar who chooses\
  \ loses, I climbed into the truck bed. I was greeted by a silver-toothed smile and\
  \ a stench that all but slapped me in the face. In Spanish, the man told me he was\
  \ indigenous. I took a photo (captioning it \u201CHis tribe evidently had a dentist\u201D\
  \ on Facebook.)\n\nHe wasn\u2019t the source of the sickening smell. No, those noxious\
  \ odors came from the overflowing bags beside us. I\u2019d just willingly climbed\
  \ aboard the weekly dump run. But from the whiffs I got, the bags\u2019 contents\
  \ probably belonged in a compost bin. My free ride reeked of rotten produce. Every\
  \ time we hit a pothole, I struggled to keep in my stomach's contents. When we finally\
  \ reached town, I stumbled out of the truck \u2013 much like how I\u2019d arrived\
  \ on Ometepe. I was either dehydrated or drunk from the fermented fruit I\u2019\
  d been commuting with for the last half hour. \u201CThis is Nicaragua,\u201D I sighed,\
  \ before thanking the driver for humbling me with his hospitality. \n\nI started\
  \ to walk back toward the port. Maybe I could still catch the tail end of that AA\
  \ meeting..."
