Text: "Unruffled /The prairies of Bukidnon   02/25/19\nBy Ruffy Magbanua\nWherever\
  \ I may roam the distant land to see, I long to go back soon to sweet Bukidnon home,\
  \ Her lovely mountains high with forest old and grand, Bring memories to me the\
  \ home I long to see\u2026     --Excerpts from \u201CBukidnon, My Home\u201D, provincial\
  \ anthem of Bukidnon  province. \nDRIVING through a road less traveled to Bukidnon\
  \ at the onset of summer   is a bit nostalgic and  \u2018sweet\u2019 as pleasantly\
  \ manifested in the province\u2019s iconic provincial anthem. \nTravelers   have\
  \ taken this scenic Talakag-Lantapan-Aglayan Road as alternate highway, a great\
  \ escape from the crowded, chaotic Sayre Highway. \nThis new route is  traffic-free,\
  \ and  sports a scenic view of the Kitangland and Kalatungan Mountain Ranges.  And\
  \ the province\u2019s prairies are endless \u2013 a great, grand view of nature\u2019\
  s bounty.  Indeed, an awesome display of Bukidnon\u2019s  version of prairies of\
  \ the West.\nThis is the new highway that takes you back in time \u2013 fresh unpolluted\
  \ air, iconic villages, care-free kids at play and green fields far and wide.\n\
  To travel to this landlocked province is no longer one hell of a ride.   Thanks\
  \ to alternate routes  under the Duterte\u2019s \u2019build, build, build\u2019\
  \ program.\nOn the other hand, the old Sayre Highway, the national road network\
  \ that  cuts across  the province has been   on a never-ending road repair binge\
  \ since time immemorial.\nThis is still a picture of utter disregard of road safety,\
  \ truly a dismal display of arrogance and irresponsible engineering works of favored\
  \ contractors under DPWH Secretary Mark Villar.\n The province\u2019s patriarch,\
  \ Governor Jose  \u2018Nonoy Joe\u2019 Zubiri  may be   keeping a prolonged  lament\
  \ on  DPWH\u2019s penchant of \u2018butchering\u2019 Bukidnon\u2019s primary road\
  \ link to the regional cities of Cagayan de Oro  and Davao. \n Sayre Highway is\
  \ that portion of the national highway which starts from Puerto in Cagayan de Oro\
  \ City to Davao  City via Buda along the borders of Kitaotao, Bukidnon and North\
  \ Cotabato.\nThe 192-kilometer long highway  was named after Francis Bowes Sayre,\
  \ Sr., a professor at Harvard Law School who was the United States\u2019 High Commissioner\
  \ to the Philippines from 1947 to 1952. \n\t\t\t\t\t\nThe American diplomat spearheaded\
  \ the initial  construction of the Bukidnon highway, hence the name Sayre Highway.\
  \ \nAmid the vast green fields of corn, sugarcane, pineapple  and banana plantations,\
  \ this province of over a million people have been suffering from  \u2018prostituted\u2019\
  \ infra brought about by DPWH\u2019s bad habit of wasting people\u2019s money  on\
  \ never-ending repairs of Bukidnon\u2019s only arterial highway.  \nNoticeably,\
  \ there is no one  seems to bother complaining about except perhaps Gov. Joe Zubiri\
  \ who, by this time, may have  gone berserk on DPWH\u2019s  \u2018old school\u2019\
  \  mindset. \nOver the years, the construction of the widening road project of Sayre\
  \ Highway, as closely observed, is  moving in a turtle-paced fashion -- too slow,\
  \ already overtaken by time as DPWH continue to brag about its accomplishments under\
  \ a Villar mantra. \nForget Sayre Highway.  Take the new route to Bukidnon.  It\
  \ pays to experience the long and winding Talakag-Lantapan-Aglayan alternate road.\
