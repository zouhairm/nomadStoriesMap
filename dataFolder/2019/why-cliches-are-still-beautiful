Text: "hen I came to Paris, as every day dreamer, I wanted to fall in love. So I did.\
  \ I fell in love with being alive. Every journey starts somehow. Mine started with\
  \ what if. Two months of volunteering project brought me two different ways of looking\
  \ at this city that once you arrive, promises you all and nothing in the same time.\
  \ Maybe I should\u2019ve asked the Universe for, you know, normal stuff. The things\
  \ that you often ask when you go to the groceries shop even if you don\u2019t actually\
  \ need something. But instead of that, I asked for a journey full of magic, enthusiasm\
  \ and unknown. And I\u2019ve received more than I expected. I found what we call\
  \ la joie de vivre. I\u2019ve learned how to give more of myself by becoming a life\
  \ traveler. This may seem very complicated sometimes. Especially when you start\
  \ to grow up. But when you are young, you are challenging yourself to become fearless,\
  \ little by little. And I think, this is what traveling does. It opens a new path\
  \ where we can be us without really being us. I mean the old ones that used to doubt\
  \ about wearing a pink leather jacket or running the extra-mile or yelling \u2018\
  \u2019I love interstellar bees\u2019\u2019 in the middle of the stadium. Because\
  \ becoming yourself more and more as days are passing by requires a lot of bravery.\
  \ \n Paris. A leap into the history? A breathing masterpiece? A cultural clash?\
  \ A place that I could call home for almost two months. Louvre. Jardin de Tuileries.\
  \ Jardin des Plantes. Eiffel Tower. A rooftop at a dorm where I could see all the\
  \ city before the storm. The Bar \u2018\u2019Le Chat noir\u2019\u2019. This is not\
  \ a list, even I am the one that loves to keep her things organised. When you are\
  \ travelling you should keep on eye on what it suits you. Museums, gardens or bars.\
  \ This is more about a little shortcut with the things that you have to do when\
  \ you go to Paris. \nSo, do you want to make a new friend while you are staring\
  \ at Van Gogh portrait? Mus\xE9e d'Orsay might be the place to get some inspiration\
  \ for your daily life. (They have \u2018\u2019Starry night too.) Also, don\u2019\
  t forget about Mus\xE9e de l\u2019Orangerie, Mus\xE9e Picasso and Centre Pompidou.\
  \ And if you are in search for some food for soul and silence, Auvers-sur-Oise is\
  \ the perfect place for you. Or you want maybe to create even more deeper connections?\
  \ Than the Spoken Word Poetry Night at Chat Noir it may bring you some folks that\
  \ go as crazy as you when it comes to living life and art. And they will eventually\
  \ come with you for a picnic and a jazz concert at La Gare. And spend your last\
  \ day in Paris around you, on the roof of a very high building. Do you feel like\
  \ you are having a bad day? Then go to The Shoah Memorial. You will remember how\
  \ lucky you are just because you are breathing right now. If you feel more like\
  \ celebrating, go to Cafe des Psaumes. There you can listen songs that are still\
  \ keeping the rhythm of history inside them. Yes, the coffee is good too. As strong\
  \ as the sensations you have when you are staying across the Seine and you see the\
  \ lights of the big tower raising while you share some wine with a friend from your\
  \ country that happened to be there for holidays. (Sometimes I wonder what will\
  \ be the name of the movie that they will make about my life. \u2018\u2019Don\u2019\
  t use cliches in literature. Live then and leave them\u2019\u2019 Sounds as good\
  \ as pineapple on pizza, doesn\u2019t it?)\n\n\n          Dear younger self, allowing\
  \ you to grow is one of the best ideas you ever had. You need this. I mean, rediscovering\
  \ yourself by crossing borders, real or imaginary. Paris is a chapter of the kaleidoscopic\
  \ book that you have to sign as a way to say \u2018\u2019Thank you\u2019\u2019 to\
  \ this world that waits you to spread your joie de vivre.\n\n\n                \
  \                                              With love, \n                   \
  \                                           The traveler that will never stop chasing\
  \ the sunrise"
