Text: "Tunisia is a country with a colossal historical and natural variety. A country\
  \ that embraces an entirety of climates , a country that started its greek journey\
  \ with the company of Alyssa through a fascinating nature and a graceful heritage\
  \ towards the land of ancient mosaics!\n\nThe heart of viridescent Tunisia is the\
  \ ancient \u201CMedina\u201D which will be our first stop. Enrobed with a mythical\
  \ charm and a deeply rooted history, strong for 13 centuries, the walls of archaism\
  \ will welcome you scented with the fumes of \u201CChicha\u201D hybrated with Sufi\
  \ chants and folk culture. Visitors are embellished with \u201CEl machmum\u201D\
  \ and its walls are enrobed with arabic scriptures and drawings.\n\nWe will wrap\
  \ up this unique journey on day 3 where we arrive to Sidi Bousaid on bikes, a suburban\
  \ town that sits over the top of a rock cliff far away from the fuss and the fray\
  \ of a fast-paced life. The fruit of the sky swaying between the shades of blue\
  \ and white, know best for embracing the sea,a tourist favorite indeed! \n\nLet\u2019\
  s take a stroll between the sturdy building of \u201Chalq el oued\u201D that stands\
  \ as a symbol of social harmony ,a harbour its yachts and a home for beautiful beaches.\
  \ Its beauty is through its spanish castle that overlooks the sea.\n\nThe next day\
  \ will be an intro to the \u201CFatimi\u2019 culture starting with a gate to history:\
  \ El Mahdia.\nPassing through the ceiled alley \u201CEsqifa El Kahla\u201D. The\
  \ calmest of all cities known for its port and its \u201Cmedina\u201D.\n\nLet\u2019\
  s move on to something from the spirit of \u201CAmazigh\u201D to the \u201Cjamaa\
  \ el ouyoun\u201D know as Tataouine the planet of Tatoustine in Star Wars. We\u2019\
  ll take a walk between fantasy and reality from the grace of the mountains to the\
  \ internal beauty of the unique village of Matmata.\n\nWe will then take off to\
  \ Djerba the Island of Dreams as we leave the land to ascend a pirate ship that\
  \ will sail to the island of flamingos where will indulge ourselves in pearly beaches\
  \ and Tunisian food delights coming from the depths of planet earth.\n\nA barbaric\
  \ day overflowing with drawings and the ancient Djerbian architecture."
