Text: "Four years ago, I hopped on a plane for the very first time to live the biggest\
  \ adventure of my life. I was twenty-three, coming from a small town in the North\
  \ of France, stuck in an endless routine, doing a job I hated, hanging out with\
  \ bitter friends and living by the day. \nBut I have always been a dreamer. I knew\
  \ that somehow, I would find a way to escape. I would find the key to this exit\
  \ door I knew was there. I found this key in the shape of a young romantic man who\
  \ as soon as he met me, asked me to fly away with him. I saw the door open and all\
  \ I could see was a vertiginous blue sky. All I had to do was to jump. Is that craziness?\
  \ \n \nNo, it\u2019s called freedom. We booked a one-way flight to spend a year\
  \ on the complete other side of the world; a country I barely knew about. \nWe landed\
  \ in Sydney, Australia. We were two strangers lost in a busy city, wandering around\
  \ with our suitcases, exhausted and overwhelmed by the morning heat. We found our\
  \ hostel on Lamrock Street, right next to the famous Bondi Beach, and felt amazingly\
  \ relieved to finally put our luggage down. I had not slept for two days so I urgently\
  \ needed to rest.\nWe naturally woke up early the next morning, feeling absolutely\
  \ fresh and full of energy. It was five o\u2019clock and I saw a stream of light\
  \ passing through the curtains. I got up, opened the window: a charming little street,\
  \ a middle-age woman walking her dog on a quick pace along the white fences, and\
  \ I heard birdsongs. Right in front of me, the most colorful wild parrots I have\
  \ ever seen flying through the frangipani trees.\n\u201CGet up, we\u2019re going\
  \ to the beach.\u201D \nIt was so early but the city was wide awake. The stores\
  \ were already open, people were jogging, exercising, there was a soft energy in\
  \ the air, something I never felt before. Then, I could feel the sea breeze in my\
  \ hair, caressing my neck. We took our shoes off and started walking on the hot\
  \ white sand, to soak our feet in the Pacific Ocean. We stayed there together, staring\
  \ at the horizon, listening to the sound of the waves, the sound of the stand-up\
  \ paddles digging in the water. A memory of my dad came back into my mind: when\
  \ I was six, I asked him what was beyond the horizon. He told me \u201Cone day,\
  \ you will go there, and you will find out.\u201D \n\nThat was it, I made my way\
  \ beyond the horizon. I raised my head, and I saw a vertiginous blue sky. I looked\
  \ at the young man who brought me here, the one I truly fell in love with, the key\
  \ to my freedom. \nFor the first time of my life I could actually breathe. For the\
  \ first time, I didn\u2019t feel any weight in my chest. The pressure was gone.\
  \ I was going to spend a year off travelling around a beautiful country, getting\
  \ out of my comfort zone, and gaining experience. \nIt turns out I never left Australia.\
  \ We made friends along the way, we got stronger, and I learned so much about myself.\
  \ Going back to France in my old routine would be a massive step backward, why would\
  \ I ever do that? \n\nFour years ago, I hopped on a plane for the very first time,\
  \ and it was the best decision of my life. \nAustralia helped me to find peace and\
  \ serenity in the hardest moments. I feel grateful every single day of what I have\
  \ and all the things that I can do. Living in this country increased my determination\
  \ to be successful and most of all, it literally set me free. I can say it, since\
  \ then even though I am still not resident of this country, Australia is my home."
