Text: "In Machadodorp is where I now reside. In a block of flats which has an uncanny\
  \ resemblance to a colourful Lego creation. We live on the 3rd floor of a vacant\
  \ section, our couches are a moss shade of green and currently seat a few floral,\
  \ R10 cushions we found at the hospice store in Johannesburg.\nThere is not much\
  \ here and people find time to do menial things like wash their bathroom mats or\
  \ talk about the weather. I am sitting on the top of the staircase, at the top of\
  \ the 3rd floor looking out at my backyard; a few braai stands, a patch of grass\
  \ and a washing line; draped in boys underwear; Cars. I hear the same sounds, an\
  \ eager woman trying to get her point across to the other side of the line, randy\
  \ men in their weekend mood (though not limited to the weekend here) loud music;\
  \ either gospel on Sundays and then of course the House or R&B tracks which no chillas\
  \ is complete without. Today however, there is a lawnmower, a new addition to this\
  \ poitjie of sounds, one which I haven\u2019t yet heard here. It is alien and obnoxious\
  \ and although I reside on the third floor, crystal clear. \nMy arrival here in\
  \ Mpumalanga was a rush of anticipation, the drive long, dirt road promising. The\
  \ Farm, an unknown territory that inhabited makers, creatives, artists, oumas and\
  \ oupas and the men and women who worked together to keep the farm running. Those\
  \ who had become monumental links of this eclectic family. I was entering into it\
  \ too, one of dancers and cows and chickens and the dancing dog that would energetically\
  \ and elegantly run into the dance studio each day; Bella. \nI remember thinking\
  \ how vast the moment felt as I looked out at the green green field that stretched\
  \ out further than I could see. There was a mountain that presented itself to me\
  \ fiercely, an uncertain forest kneeling below and an enchanting pool of water I\
  \ knew we would swim in. I had never lived on a farm before and I couldn\u2019t\
  \ help but ponder on how life here was an organic experience. Whether it was being\
  \ woken up at 7am by a tractor; punctual. Greeting a herd of cows as you left the\
  \ dance studio, looking up to see a sky full of stars or just being surrounded by\
  \ nature in its purest form. \nIt was nothing like the city.\nIt was nothing like\
  \ Johannesburg\nI spent two months living on this tranquil piece of land where the\
  \ cows and chickens and dancers and dogs coexisted and where chocolate cake on birthdays\
  \ became ritual. Where recycling was taken seriously and plastic, paper, tin and\
  \ food waste was kept apart. \nAnd then we left, 20 minutes out on the dirt road\
  \ to where I now sit and watch flat dwellers sip their Hunters dry beer furiously,\
  \ it is a hot day and their throats are dry.  \nThere is not much here in Machadodorp,\
  \ two pubs, one tavern, a hardware store that burnt down, a PEP store and one grocery\
  \ store owned by foreign nationals; they have the monopoly in the town and have\
  \ everything from soap to salt. In Machadodorp, you can\u2019t make a quick McDonald\u2019\
  s stop or go out for lunch in Melville or Parkhurst. There certainly is no way you\
  \ can go window shopping at Zara or TopShop or at least just Mr Price. Which is\
  \ something you eventually become content with in a small town, when you realise\
  \ that life is not in fact about these inconsequential desires. The fact does still\
  \ remain though, there is an eerie sense of loneliness in this here, quietness which\
  \ one must get used to. \nThere really isn\u2019t much in this town but here I found\
  \ stillness. Peace in the self I have begun to excavate in the last year living\
  \ in Mpumalanga, Machadodorp. Every drive from the town Machadodorp to the farm\
  \ feels like driving through the dust that has brought me there. It is our last\
  \ day together on the farm and it is raining. \nPouring. \nThey are blessings, here\
  \ from Machadodorp, with love."
