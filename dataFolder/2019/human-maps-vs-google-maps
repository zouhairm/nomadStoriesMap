Text: "An adventure to the Himalayas needed a rocky beginning of its own, otherwise\
  \ it's just a beach holiday - flat and sandy.\n\nJust few days prior, me and my\
  \ college confidantes hopped on to our trip that had already got cancelled once.\
  \ Did we expect the trip to cancel again? Yes. \nBut even with Indian parents being\
  \ their true self, three girls made it to Delhi hoping to get on the evening bus\
  \ to Dalhousie, Himachal Pradesh. But that didn't happen. Due to the terrors and\
  \ the tension between India and Pakistan, and the tension building in the hearts\
  \ of our parents, we decided to hold back our trip and see where the trip is leading\
  \ to. From this point, cancelling all our pre-bookings, our trip went from a planned\
  \ holiday to on the go adventure guided by Human Maps. Why we call them that? You\
  \ will know. \n\nOur first 'human map' was a traveler we met at Zostel Delhi (a\
  \ great chill hostel BTW). She was staying in our dorm and she could outright guess\
  \ the disappointments in our faces. But man, was I in awe of her. You show me a\
  \ bold traveler who is not visiting, but exploring places, my eyes just got wide,\
  \ very wide. She had come back from her trip at the India-Pakistan border, and that\
  \ became our first guidance. Her words of confidence and experiences was enough\
  \ to get us motivated to re-book the cancelled bus to Dalhousie. God bless her for\
  \ the direction even Media news channels faced to give us. \n\nOur second encounter\
  \ with a 'human map' was the bunch of boys who were the management of our hostel\
  \ way up on the mountain. They were 23-24, while they looked 30, an epitome of the\
  \ perfect gentlemen you rarely meet these day. If you ask me, what direction did\
  \ they took me to, they didn't. But they opened my eyes to the life of local boys\
  \ who wait to turn 25 so that their family will get them married. This is their\
  \ sole motivation to face those himalayan dangers and earn money. And any which\
  \ ways, Google Maps is not just about reaching the destination, it gives you insights\
  \ on the destination as well. Why should 'human maps' be any different? \n\nNow,\
  \ we are headed for the last tale of 'human maps'. For a background story, our Dalhousie\
  \ to Mcleodganj journey was supposed to be via bus, a route that all travelers prefer.\
  \ But our local Dalhousie cab driver for two days convinced of an exciting road\
  \ trip opportunity till Dalhousie which would be faster, and would help us reach\
  \ directly our Hostel. We got tempted on the word \"Road Trip\". But lack of petrol\
  \ in Himalayas got us delayed by 4-5 hours. Trust me, as the day gets darker, the\
  \ cities get quieter. We actually removed THE GOOGLE MAP and tried reaching our\
  \ hostel post making it to Mcleodganj. But who were we to fool the Himalayan turns\
  \ with our technology. Human Maps were the only surviving thing at that city. We\
  \ got lost and took the help of an extremely good-looking man. We totally man-crushed\
  \ on him. He got us not only to our hostel, but ensured we checked-in to the place\
  \ safely. Now, the mancrush became gentleman-crush. Boy, did we learn our lesson\
  \ from mighty Himalayas? Yes, we did. We totally did. \n\nOver all, technology is\
  \ a great boon, but is a pain when it fumbles. \nBut Human Maps is a positive either\
  \ ways - if you get it right, you reach your destination, if you get it wrong, you\
  \ just have a beautiful experience."
