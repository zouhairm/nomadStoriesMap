Text: "I was afraid about my trip to Egypt. People tells you so many things, that\
  \ It was very difficult to keep my mind away from those thoughts. I had a ticket\
  \ with my friend from El Cairo to Casablanca, we planned to stay in Egypt nearly\
  \ 15 days, more than the average which stay for 10 days or less. We'll spend New\
  \ Year\u2019s celebrations in Athens and fly to El Cairo on January 2nd.\n\nThe\
  \ adventure began. Two women alone in Egypt. We didn\u2019t book a tour for those\
  \ days. Our plan was do it by ourselves. Not too crazy because is what we always\
  \ do, but the comments of travelers were deep inside our minds. We decided to be\
  \ aware but leave all previous comments behind. We had hostel reservations and knew\
  \ which transport use from one city to another. \n\nOur first contact was with cab\
  \ drivers at the airport. It was as we were told. People talking and talking, barganing\
  \ and trying to sell us the trip from the airport straight to Alexandria. It wasn\u2019\
  t really expensive, but for our budget it was, and we knew there were a bus doing\
  \ the same route. After asking a few people, we could find the bus station and the\
  \ bus to Alexandria. \n\nThe bus trip was weird in some things, like: stopping at\
  \ the side of the road or suddenly see a boy, in the middle of a bridge, that gave\
  \ packages to the driver. This package delivery included money, given in a very\
  \ discreet way.\n\nAfter a good trip we arrived in Alexandria. And we had our first\
  \ problem. There are several bus station in every egyptian city. We never realized\
  \ about that and the one we\u2019d arrived was really far from our hostel. No internet,\
  \ no roaming in our phones to contact the hostel. So, we decided to ask how to reach\
  \ the hostel at the Go Bus ticket office (this is a company highly recommended in\
  \ traveler\u2019s blogs). The employee didn\u2019t speak English, but the man who\
  \ was buying a ticket does.\n\nHe offered to procure a taxi for us and tell the\
  \ driver where we where going. At least, that was what we understood. This man got\
  \ on the taxi with us, talked to the driver all the way. Founded the entrance to\
  \ the building, took the elevator with us (the hostel was in a 10th floor) and he\
  \ didn\u2019t let us lonely until he, and we, were safe at the hostel front desk.\
  \ He didn\u2019t accept our money to pay the taxi. \n\nI know, this anecdote could\
  \ have ended badly, but not. \n\nMy friend and I had a few experiences like this\
  \ in our journey thought Egipt. A guest of the hostel was traveling with us on the\
  \ train back to Cairo, he accompanied us to the seats of the coach. Once we arrived\
  \ at the Ramses Station, he called us an Uber to get to the hotel in Giza and was\
  \ in touch to see that we arrived safely. Other day, a girl at the metro station\
  \ saw us looking the map and help us to find the right platform, offered to buy\
  \ our tickets but she didn\u2019t accept the money. She didn\u2019t speak fluent\
  \ English but sign language is global and with a smile and hand move she rejected\
  \ our cash.\n\t\nAll this experiences made us think what to believe. And we realised\
  \ you can\u2019t believe anybody, even your closest friend.  It's true what people\
  \ tell you about cultural shock, the harassment of salesmen, but it\u2019s also\
  \ true you\u2019ll find beautiful people ready to extend their hands to help you.\
  \ \n\nYou must go to that place and live it."
