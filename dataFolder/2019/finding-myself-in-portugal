Text: "She was there, and still couldn\u2019t actually feel that it was real. The\
  \ sand, the sun, the waves, the breeze...everything was exactly the same as usual,\
  \ but she wasn't. And once you\u2019ve changed, nothing remains the same. So even\
  \ though Lisbon was still Lisbon, Eva wasn\u2019t Eva anymore after that endless\
  \ summer of 2016. or at least she didn\u2019t feel like Eva anymore ). \nAnd it\
  \ sounds funny coz summer it\u2019s suposed to be the best part of the year, full\
  \ of fun, good vibes, new adventures, trips, new people. \nBut not this time, not\
  \ this summer. And it wasn\u2019t because there has been no trip or she hasn't met\
  \ new people, the fact that it was different was because Eva finally find herself\
  \ (maybe not completely, but a vital part of her) and in that search of Eva she\
  \ lost herself as well. I know it\u2019s sounds crazy, but I have a point - at some\
  \ point- . During that warm summer she could felt the four seasons of the year in\
  \ her hole soul, and it was pretty much as a strange and long trip into herself.\
  \ \nOh I\u2019m sorry , I started this story by the end of it, how stupid! Let me\
  \ restart this and tell how Eva became Eva, how Lisbon became Lisbon and how both\
  \ stop being themselves to became someone else and somewhere else in just one particular\
  \ summer. \nShall we start this journey togheter?"
