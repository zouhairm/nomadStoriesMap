Text: "To travel is to learn. And by travelling, we are making million leaps toward\
  \ the unknowns, while we are resolving the Socrates enigma, that says to us that\
  \ all what we know, is that we know nothing. Thus, every step we make, we are widening\
  \ our horizons of knowledge, and also, furthering our scope of doubts and unknowns.\
  \ We are nothing else except curious species.\nAncient emperors thought of raising\
  \ their armies and conquering new lands and incorporating the new cultures within\
  \ their central government. So, it was the Alexander the Great story. His father\
  \ united the Hellenic empire, just to lead his son road toward the greatest. Alexander\
  \ started his road toward the Near, Middle and Far East, with his intention to show\
  \ his strength, and to conquer the whole world during his road. He did achieve the\
  \ most of his intentions during the road. But within his spirit, it happened something\
  \ that he never foresaw. He always thought of conquering lands, but he never knew\
  \ that these lands, and cultures, will conquer his soul and spirit. Even though,\
  \ in the very beginning he was a typical Macedonian-Hellenic person (by his doing\
  \ and wearing), in the end of the story he turned out to transform into the new\
  \ culture, by wearing the middle east clothes, by loving Persian songs, and by adoring\
  \ his biggest enemy, the Darius. He organized a special funeral ceremony in his\
  \ respect, and also, did a big ceremony of marriages between his Macedonian commanders,\
  \ and the new land wives.\nMore important than the story itself, is the story moral.\
  \ Alexander the Great, Kublai Khan and other great emperor stories tell us about\
  \ how it is to expose our mind and our body, in the new civilization and culture.\
  \ It also shows that, no matter how much you appreciate your own culture (as being\
  \ the best one), in the end of the day when you expose your brain, into new cultures,\
  \ you will always be vulnerable toward changes, since there is no bad or good culture.\
  \ It is just, how open or closed mind we are, and how much we do travel, to see\
  \ these changes, during the road. Despite the fact that Alexander died in a very\
  \ young age, as 32 years old, he achieved, experienced and saw, much more than a\
  \ lot of people living hundred year. His story tells us that, it is not about the\
  \ quantity of living, but about the quality of the moments, and by travelling, we\
  \ are exposing to new experiences.\nObviously, me and my millennials aren\u2019\
  t intending to be the new emperors of the time, but, to better use the Alexander\
  \ story of exploring, and to learn by travelling toward the unknown."
