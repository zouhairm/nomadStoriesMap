Text: "Madrid is a beast of a city. Whirring metros, speed-walking pedestrians, brightly\
  \ colored and dramatically ornate skyscrapers all accompanied by the faint wafting\
  \ smells of churros and the delicate sounds of the Spanish language. But for a small\
  \ American girl like me with the ambition to spend an entire year in Madrid, I have\
  \ much less touristy items on my to-do list. \n\nMuch to my chagrin, it turns out\
  \ that \"to-do lists\" are on the bottom of Madrid's totem pole of priorities. Any\
  \ encounter with officialdom is a test of endurance. You want an extended Visa in\
  \ Spain? The queues are ceaseless, the office has flexible (read: unpredictable)\
  \ hours, and it seems the rules and regulations change every other day. I'd say\
  \ official inefficiency is a fine art in Madrid. Even attempting to use the postal\
  \ service is an ordeal that will drive any stand-up citizen to chugging vino tinto\
  \ with the most seasoned of Spaniards. But going hand-in-hand with this disability\
  \ to accomplish the most mundane of chores comes an unspoken rule: \"tranquila.\"\
  \ It\u2019s a word I find myself face-to-face with on more than one occasion. Always\
  \ uttered by a lightly smiling Spaniard empathizing with my embarrassingly apparent\
  \ frustration. \u201CTranquila.\u201D \n\nSo while the small American girl rushes\
  \ around with her pointless to-do lists of bank accounts and visa appointments,\
  \ Madrid smiles lazily and reclines back in its easy chair. Apparently, in Madrid\
  \ you're supposed to neglect all responsibilities and lay in the park at least once\
  \ a day. Furthermore, score even higher on your cultural fluency by bringing some\
  \ wine for your park blanket. \n\nWholeheartedly, I will say the Spanish got one\
  \ thing totally right: their unrivalled zest for life and their \"tranquila\" approach\
  \ to all circumstances. Spaniards prove to be inveterate celebrants, constantly\
  \ finding another reason for an impromptu fiesta. However, if no fiestas are to\
  \ be found, you can catch your locals indulging in wine and animated conversation\
  \ around ever corner... starting at 3pm. Forget that there are things to be done;\
  \ that can wait until tomorrow. If I were to translate the Spanish way of life into\
  \ three words, it would be \"nap, play, and be merry.\"\n\nThis brings me to another\
  \ of Spain's charmingly slow and inefficient habits: \"sombremesa.\" Sobremesa translates\
  \ loosely to \u201Cover the table,\u201D but this delightful term simply refers\
  \ to the time spent around the table with friends and family long after the food\
  \ has been removed. I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve had a meal in Spain yet that was\
  \ any less than 2 hours in length, with most meals leaning more towards 3. Initially,\
  \ the American in me inhaled my food and was eager to proceed to the next sight,\
  \ the next metro junction, the next grand palace. Not here, my friend. But, in turn,\
  \ meals have become my favorite events in Madrid. Small dinner gatherings have a\
  \ way of creeping on until midnight, laden with abundant laughter and Spanish-style\
  \ cheek kisses all around. The phrase that always comes to mind after a meal with\
  \ friends is \u201Cbarriga llena, corazon contento\u201D or full belly, happy heart.\n\
  \nDespite my rush and my initial judgement of the city, the daily pace proves to\
  \ be slower in Madrid. The word \u201Ctranquila\u201D echos throughout the afternoons\
  \ with more emphasis on enjoyment rather than achievement. It seems my only real\
  \ obligations, despite my opinions otherwise, are to just go out and tackle the\
  \ day with all the enthusiasm I can muster.  With this being said, it\u2019s no\
  \ surprise that when I hit the mattress each night I am fully worn out. Each day\
  \ holds a feeling equivalent to driving with the windows down. Madrile\xF1os have\
  \ \"tranquila\" down to a science. While here, it seems as though I am truly living.\
  \ Not just preparing to live later on when my bank account is full and my calendar\
  \ is empty. \n\nSo the story goes that my determined hurry found it's burial ground\
  \ in Madrid's \"tranquila.\" Beware to all my over-achievers; making a local connection\
  \ in Madrid means coming to peace with a simple three-syllable colloquialism: \u201C\
  tranquila.\""
