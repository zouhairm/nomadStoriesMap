Text: 'Imagine how I will travel to Portugal, that the first idea I decided to write
  it now. Oh no, it is hard. I just decided it five minutes ago to do it but then
  want to leave my laptop again and back to my other activity. Think again and think
  again, I never be a writer. As I know only write some medical record and medication
  prescription, never thought to write something like this. But this World Nomads
  advertising tickling me to write and inspire me to just not to be only an Imaginer.
  Overthingking about how to write or about my English that not good enough  are never
  push me to be the next level. Not only trying how to be a travel writer, but also
  win this project and get a trip to Portugal is out of my beyond imagination to prove
  to myself.


  Portugal especially Porto is one of my best country I ever visit. Remembering the
  old buildings everywhere, the long fancy river, and the students who still wearing
  black robe in the street were such as my best favourite than the other place. The
  smells of the rain remembered clearly on my imagination. Wondering ride the tram
  in the middle of the beauiful ancient streets, walking cross the amazing Dom Luis
  bridge, and also riding the Funicular dos Guindais were absolutely extraordinary
  pleasure. The ornamen in everybuilding walls are elegant and manificent, looks like
  an old-fashioned but still exotic in every part. All this century frames makes me
  want back there and see the other side of Portugal.'
