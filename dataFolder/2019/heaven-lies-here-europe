Text: We started off from UK to Netherlands , Germany, Austria, Switzerland,Florence,
  paris, Rome, Milan. But , I choose to talk about switzerland. Country of mountains
  , snow , beauty and bollywood's famous DDLJ. I am still Awestruck at its beauty
  even after 9 months. Mount titlis where they have a DDLJ poster put up and a mountain
  thousands of metre high from where you can feel the breeze and milky-white snow
  scenery.  Not for a moment will you ever feel obnoxious whilw in Switzerland. Heaven
  truly lies here. It holds a beauty which stays in my brain like a photograph clicked
  and saved forever.  It speaks class. Can you imagine a landscape of greenery and
  a cattle around with a mountain of snow behind? A river of fresh water flowing through?
  A gandola which takes you from ground (like a rope way) to thousands of metre high.
  Do you truly want to find yourseld amidst nature? Here it is! Nature have a natural
  flair of let you neet by yourself. Switzerland does that for you. It's like an inspiration
  which generates a sense of motivation to do things better bigger to achieve more
  in life and travel alot. It has its way of telling us the world has a lot to show.
  Europe probably has the best of people. As their attitude towards us was really
  good and helpful. In short if I have to put it up then I am going to say. It is
  a trip I would definitely go on again and a place to be worked hard for to pay a
  visit to.
