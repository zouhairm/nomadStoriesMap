Text: "Oman shaped this girl, Paulina into an anxiety survivor. The job forced her\
  \ to be calm and chill in every terms. Her office it\u2019s up there in the skies,\
  \ even you can see the calmness and feel those skies so blue and rub your eyes when\
  \ you take a look quite too because it stings a lot. Winds set the melody and make\
  \ you wanna dance when you have your ticket and visiting them with an aif craft\
  \ in the sky and pilot will sing \u201Cattention fasten your seatbelt brave for\
  \ the turbulance\u201D. The feelings when we can finally go to heaven, probably\
  \ it feels like kayaking. You hear the waves that makes you goosbumps all over your\
  \ body, and it moved your body slowly and calmly, as you move towards the sun, without\
  \ forcing it, you will be helped by the Mr. Winds that set a soft melody, so you\
  \ can move towards the sun, and its helping you with the reflection of the shine\
  \ that so bright and so warm feels so tickling. As long as i remember, since i carry\
  \ chaos inside me, peacefullness requires natural things. Travel helped a lot  of\
  \ mankind for mending their anxiety. But most of them mistaken the healing through\
  \ something more instant. gadget provide you the fake sound that feels like peace\
  \ feelings within minutes but it\u2019s only a fake ugly half ass hope for most\
  \ of us. people should realize that natural things you can compile them with other\
  \ natural things. In muttrah where you can see traditional market, and you will\
  \ be surprised the smell of fish which is so fishy and crowded, but lets take a\
  \ few seconds dont be complain, instead imagine that something so natural and precious,\
  \ you can feel it yourself, like literally with all your senses. Go to the beach\
  \ even in winter, turn on your recorder, record the real sound of the wave, so you\
  \ can repeat it again, again, and again, until you get fed up. High beating of your\
  \ heart means you have to hike higher in Wadi Shab, so you can conquer yourself,\
  \ the rock will help you, they are rough, some of them textured are soft , which\
  \ is you have to avoid because it may cause you slip. The color shows you sign and\
  \ clue to place your feet to the right spot, as you moving higher you are sweating,\
  \ you can hear your breath it\u2019s up and down, inhale them when you change your\
  \ feet, and exhale them when you move a little higher, and your eyes will be sting\
  \ either by the sun or by your own sweat, and you will try to avoid it as you are\
  \ keep moving, you feel your upper feet tighten, your hand shaking because they\u2019\
  re grabbing the rocks too tight, too long too strong. you feel the rope all over\
  \ you, you motivating yourself say \u201Ca \u2018lil bit more, you got this, you\
  \ will be the winner, you will conquer wadi shab\u201D. some of them survived with\
  \ the depth of the water , they swim a lot, a long way to go, a long time to go.\
  \ they bare with the cold of the water , they\u2019re legs and muscle been shattered\
  \ because of cramps, they dont care bout that. they sweat a lot, mistaken it as\
  \ a water from the lake itself, only so they can keep moving to see the beautiful\
  \ sink hole and the cave. it was so green and blue at the same time, smell of caporites,\
  \ reek of slippery tracks, but felt so challanging. People will forget themsleves,\
  \ their money, their medical conditions, their anxiety, their jobs, their depts,\
  \ their family, their bank account, their revenge, their pain, their hurts, their\
  \ pets, their belongings, their boss , forget how risky it was, forget that they\
  \ are dealing with a whole zone of nature, the gangster on Earth, forget the leader\
  \ it\u2019s not themselves, forget that the one that conquer them not themselves,\
  \ but the nature itself. Travel supposed to be natural. Nature things challange\
  \ you to conquer your true self, without you knowing that you are the one being\
  \ led by nature itself."
