Text: "Before I met Victor, we lived all Cuban clich\xE9s. It was our first international\
  \ trip together and we bought cigars, drank rum, and rode Old Russian cars. Yet,\
  \ when we arrived to the main plaza in downtown I thought of the experience as incomplete.\
  \ There was a lot Hemingway had told me. I even read \u2018magical\xB4 on the Internet\
  \ blogs. But I was not satisfied. \n We were there, in Old Havana, besides the street,\
  \ looking for a taxi that could get us back to our hotel. Fortunately we were not\
  \ lucky. All of the folkloric taxis (bike taxis named cocotaxis) were touring couples,\
  \ or families, and, as we were in Havana, there was no common taxi that we would\
  \ ride. I talked to my friends and the three of us agreed to sit and rest a while.\n\
  I could feel the brave Sun in my skin as we spread our legs, mid-square, to rest.\
  \ \u201CIt is like tuna\u201D, I thought, \u201CThey say is a fine meal. Yet, as\
  \ soon as it is canned, I lose delight.\u201D Then I turned back to watch my friends.\
  \ \u201CLet\u2019s wait\u201D, I said as I was waiting for something more than a\
  \ cab.\nThe plaza was then mainly populated by foreigners. In Havana I could identify\
  \ tourists mostly because of clothing. Cubans seemed more careless. In the Lacoste\
  \ store, in Old Havana, you could only hear English speaking. To hear Spanish you\
  \ had to go to the pier, where Cubans go to drink and talk. In other words, the\
  \ plaza was not a place of recreation. Not even for tourists, who were mainly shopping.\
  \ Cubans there tried to sell peanuts, rum, or even city guidance. The dynamic was\
  \ one of exchange, except for Victor.\nHe was about six years old and he was kicking\
  \ a deflated ball with his father and he wore shorts with no shirt nor shoes. Their\
  \ goal was improvised between two columns of a building. His father was the keeper.\
  \ Victor was the striker. Still sitting, I watched that young mulato score again\
  \ and again and again. And if there is something I cannot resist is watching someone\
  \ performing poorly on purpose. So I stood up. I left my friends. I asked his father\
  \ if I could come in as a substitute. And he agreed.\nI tried to talk with Victor.\
  \ He dared to make the goal bigger and I agreed. As we were sweating, I found out\
  \ they were from Matanzas. They have moved to Havana so the father could look up\
  \ for a job. Victor was then still a baby. All he knew of his birth place was from\
  \ stories. But he did not seemed to care now. He kicked the ball, and he seemed\
  \ happy, and I was happy and probably his father was happy.\nI had to jump a lot\
  \ and eventually regretted making the goal bigger. It did not matter. I did enjoyed\
  \ playing, and discovering that Victor did not wanted to become a professional goalkeeper.\
  \ \nTime passed by, and the Sun became less brave and my friends called me. In Havana\
  \ we had no Internet in our phones so I just waved farewell to my two play mates.\n\
  That trip happened in summer of 2016 and occasionally I still talk about it in parties\
  \ or friendly conversations. I try to tell them this story. Rum drinking, cigar\
  \ smoking, sea swimming are experiences that are canned for them even before going\
  \ to Havana. But the people, they are the ones giving you a good damn day."
