Text: "Rather chuffed with ourselves, my newly found travelling companions and I had\
  \ made our way from Costa Rica to northern Panama, with the intention of venturing\
  \ over to the Archipelago de Boca del Toro. The guide books spoke of idyllic sandy\
  \ beaches and swaying palm trees. Of psychedelic sea beds resting below sparkling\
  \ turquoise waters. I imagined relaxing in a hammock whilst sipping the juice of\
  \ a fresh coconut. Paradise is what I\u2019d envisioned. Adventure is what I had\
  \ longed for. \nI held this tropical image in my mind as I cautiously stepped off\
  \ the rickety jetty and onto the speedboat. The border crossing from Costa Rica\
  \ into Panama had been chaotic, and the manic drive from the border to the pier\
  \ had left my nerves rattled and my stomach shaken. Despite this, I followed suit\
  \ of my fellow passengers and tried to relax into my seat and embody an aura of\
  \ relaxed wanderlust. With my oversized rucksack in tow and my hareem pants bellowing\
  \ in the breeze; I certainly looked every bit the seasoned traveller. If only I\
  \ could stop my hands from fidgeting, I may have been convincing. I tried to brush\
  \ off my nerves and put them down to overly-cautious, unwarranted worries. Regardless\
  \ of my internal, worrisome monologue however; the grumble of the boat\u2019s engine\
  \ signalled that ready or not, it was time to set sail. \nWith no idea as to how\
  \ long the journey would take, I tried to remember all the exciting things I was\
  \ looking forward to seeing on the islands. Equipped with the wisdom of a few guidebooks\
  \ and an array of Pinterest pages, I had expected to feel a sense of familiarity\
  \ in these unfamiliar surroundings. Yet the tranquil image I had conjured was far\
  \ from the reality before me. Here I was, sat in what felt like a cardboard dinghy,\
  \ blindly bobbing across the Caribbean Sea. The scene before me was not what I\u2019\
  d pictured. The horizon was non-existent. A grey sheet of mist blended the water\u2019\
  s surface into the sky and the damp, murky air sent a cold shiver through my bones.\
  \ The oppressive fog was a far cry from the uninhibited freedom I\u2019d associated\
  \ with my adventure. \n\u201CHave I made a terrible mistake?\u201D \n\u201CAre we\
  \ lost?\u201D\n\u201CAm I being kidnapped?\u201D\n\u201CAre there sharks in the\
  \ Caribbean Sea?\u201D\nAll hope of finding calm on this voyage was quickly obliterated\
  \ and I found myself surrounded by a congregation of Hawaiian-shirt cladded tourists;\
  \ on the verge of a panic attack. \nMy mind got carried away with the factitious\
  \ plot it had created, and my passengers soon became characters of this fearsome\
  \ blockbuster. I tried to reason with myself and find reassurance. I searched for\
  \ an innocuous face I could cast as the hero of this saga. A Liam Neeson type character,\
  \ who would rise to the occasion and save us all. However, my fellow passengers\
  \ seemed to be blissfully unaware of the calamity of our situation. Fresh out of\
  \ ideas, I came to realise my only solution to this crisis: I would have to be the\
  \ heroine of the story. I would need to rise to the occasion and save our party\
  \ from kidnap, shark attack and shipwreck. A big task for a newbie traveller. With\
  \ my heart racing, I\u2019d never felt like such a fraud. \nCommitted to my new\
  \ role of saviour, I pushed back my shoulders and held my head up high. I closed\
  \ my eyes to summon some strength and courage. My eyes closed, I started to appreciate\
  \ my surroundings. The smell of the sea and the taste of salt on my lips. The warmth\
  \ of the sun beaming through the mist and the brush of sea breeze through my hair.\
  \ For a moment, I must have blended into the crowd of passengers. I may not have\
  \ conveyed an image of carefree, happy-go-lucky liberation. I may not have look\
  \ or felt like the strangers I had seen on Instagram and Pinterest. I did, however,\
  \ convey a sense of adventure and anticipation. Not a sense of naivety or fraudulence,\
  \ but an essence of hope and wonder. It was in that moment that I realised, that\
  \ I really was, a traveller."
