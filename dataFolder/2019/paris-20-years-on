Text: "I didn\u2019t expect to find that so much feels foreign yet strangely familiar\
  \ at the same time. The summer heat has my head spinning. I stop, close my eyes\
  \ and breath deeply; the air, the smells, my senses are tingling...is this real\
  \ or just a long imagined fabricated scene from a movie?\n\nIt had been 20 years\
  \ since I was last in Paris that should, in itself be a crime. I left promising\
  \ and eager to return, not imagining for a minute it would be two decades before\
  \ I stood again in that magical city.\n\nYet as I stand under the Eiffel Tower in\
  \ awe (again) and marvel at the solidity of it\u2019s mass of struts and beams,\
  \ the strength of its girth diminished by the presence of steely gazed heavily armed\
  \ soldiers their hands resting impatiently on their semi automatic weapons.\n\n\
  Such is our world now, such is our time, and we hardly give the soldiers a second\
  \ glance.\n\nThe Paris of my youth was foreign, exotic, exciting and genteel. A\
  \ cup of coffee could be consumed over several hours, with a free voyager experience\
  \ included in the price, as Parisians and tourists bustled past. No mobile phones,\
  \ no insta-gratification, no selfies...Paris before selfies... merde how did we\
  \ survive?\n\nI wonder what the Mona Lisa thinks of the humanity that ritually files\
  \ past. No longer seeing faces gazing into her eyes but electronic screens jostling\
  \ for position, a quick shot and unto the next inst- worthy shot. How many times\
  \ has she endured the drawl of a tourist saying,...\u201COh I thought it would have\
  \ been bigger?\u201D\n\nI didn\u2019t expect to find that with the constant change\
  \ in the world Paris, true to its wartime reputation would still have pockets of\
  \ \u2018resistance\u2019, where true Paris is alive. These pockets are getting harder\
  \ to find, but your search is time well spent and you will not be disappointed.\
  \ \n\nTo start your exploring off in the right direction, two of my favourite places\
  \ are still the Rue des Barres in Marais and Rue Mouffetard in the Latin Quarter.\
  \ These ancient roman roads are lined with family boulangeries still making the\
  \ most mouth-watering breads, the smell of which is enough to ruin any diet. I could\
  \ tell you the name of my favourite caf\xE9, but where would be the fun in your\
  \ exploration.\n\nThe other extraordinary thing travel opens to you is meeting other\
  \ people. Some are fleeting acquaintances, a steamy holiday romance (if you\u2019\
  re lucky, but usually doomed to fail) or by chance you meet a person whom you feel\
  \ you have known your entire life. That happened with my friend Michelle, we became\
  \ partners in crime, the dynamic duo of our day. She lived in Toulouse but was staying\
  \ at the same hostel in Paris, as she came up to scout out university. We quickly\
  \ became firm friends with a similar sense of humour, and sense of adventure we\
  \ became inseparable, until it was time for me to head home to Australia, my adventure\
  \ over. We promised to keep in touch, no mobile phones, or social media back then\
  \ and obviously I was going to be back soon...\n\nSo as I wait nervously near the\
  \ Eiffel Tower guarded by machines guns I wondered if Michelle had changed that\
  \ much, would there still be that connection? We have now been in touch by social\
  \ media, but the airbrush app my daughter showed me assists in ways the gym never\
  \ will. \n\nI didn\u2019t expect to find her seemingly unchanged, she still looked\
  \ exactly the same and my god it is true...French women do not get fat! It took\
  \ maybe two minutes of pleasantries before BAM we were back, talking and laughing,\
  \ about what I cannot recall.\n\nGo forth, be brave and you too will discover a\
  \ Paris that you didn\u2019t expect to find and hopefully one you will never lose.\n\
