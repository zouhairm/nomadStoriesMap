Text: "There was only one place I wanted to visit in Phnom Penh \u2013 Tuol Sleng.\
  \ I insisted on this to my friends while we were in Cambodia\u2019s capital for\
  \ 24 hours. I mentioned this to the kindly tuktuk driver who was keen on bringing\
  \ us around. But the driver suggested we go instead to Choeung Ek, one of Cambodia's\
  \ killing fields and now a memorial to the Khmer Rouge victims.\n\nI read about\
  \ Tuol Sleng in Pico Iyer\u2019s book, Sun After Dark, and since then, I wanted\
  \ to visit the place to differentiate its evocations from that of the Nazi concentration\
  \ camp I visited a decade ago in Dachau, Germany.  \n\nDachau\u2019s concentration\
  \ camp was where the Nazis experimented first its final solution to its Jewish problem.\
  \ In the 12 years of the Nazi regime, around six million European Jews died. In\
  \ the three years, eight months and 20 days of the Khmer Rouge (communist Cambodians)\
  \ regime, over a million Cambodians died. \n\nI gave in to visit the Choeung Ek\
  \ Memorial first, with reluctance. Choeung Ek was around 45 minutes of tuktuk ride\
  \ (around 17 kilometers) from Phnom Penh. It was a gated compound and had the alien\
  \ silence of a cemetery.\n\nChoeung Ek was, in fact, a Chinese cemetery before.\
  \ Now, only a Buddhist stupa reminded you of its Chinese past. The stupa housed\
  \ the over 5,000 skulls of dead Cambodians dug up from around the area.\n\nAt the\
  \ back of the stupa were few ground depressions where almost 9,000 bodies were unceremoniously\
  \ buried by the Khmer Rouge fanatics. Many of those who died there, according to\
  \ one note in the area, were blindfolded with the krama, Cambodia\u2019s ubiquitous\
  \ scarf, before they were shot. Against the undergrown and gnarled tree in front\
  \ of the stupa, another note said, Khmer Rouge soldiers banged children\u2019s heads\
  \ to death. \n\nOne could read the story of the Khmer Rouge regime in the small\
  \ museum inside the compound and a documentary was also shown every 15 minutes.\n\
  \nWhen we transferred to Tuol Sleng, which was the Khmer Rouge\u2019s equivalent\
  \ to the Nazi concentration camps, I was disappointed. It was a museum lacking in\
  \ narratives.  You get more idea of the Khmer Rouge regime and their victims in\
  \ Choeung Ek. \n\nMost of Tuol Sleng was left intact after the neighboring Vietnam\
  \ brought an end to the regime. The barbed-wired fence, iron-barred windows, classrooms\
  \ subdivided into one-holed cells the size of single beds had been left in their\
  \ places, untouched but cleaned up of blood.  \n\nIn a room, posted on boards and\
  \ walls were the black and white half-body photos of prisoners. They stared, unsmiling,\
  \ and defeated. Most of them bore marks of what they had undergone right before\
  \ their photos were taken. \n\nOne got a general idea of what happened there but\
  \ not of the particular stories of the prisoners and how they wove into the Khmer\
  \ Rouge story. The narratives posted on the walls of the empty rooms were a mesh\
  \ of incomplete political documents and historical narratives. A poem written by\
  \ a Cambodian in a correctional facility in the U.S. was one of those posted but\
  \ we were unsure whether he was a survivor or not for we were not told. \n\nA lot\
  \ were untold in Tuol Sleng.  In Dachau, the Germans did not wince in exposing its\
  \ past.  In Tuol Sleng, it was as though the Cambodians were reluctant to tell its\
  \ own.\n\nIt was understandable.  Tuol Sleng was a former all-girls school before\
  \ it housed the regime\u2019s enemy. In the handle bar in its former playground,\
  \ Khmer Rouge enemies were hanged and in the playground, they were shot.\n\nThe\
  \ rules that were usually posted in the school grounds were replaced with regulations\
  \ for the prisoners. \u201CWhile getting lashes or electrification you must not\
  \ cry at all,\u201D stated regulation 6.\n\nBeds brought into the classrooms and\
  \ water drums were used for torture\u2014beds to hold the prisoners while electrocuted,\
  \ drums to drown them in.\n\nThe Khmer Rouge was successful in turning banal things\
  \ like their krama, schools, playground, beds, water drums, and trees into instruments\
  \ of murder. Who would want to perpetuate the narratives of evil to these otherwise\
  \ neutral and innocent things?"
