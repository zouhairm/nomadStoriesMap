Text: "They say the hardest part of writing is the beginning, and I've found this\
  \ statement to be VERY true so I guess Im just going to \u201Cwing it\u201D.\nI\
  \ guess the beginning of me wanting to start writing came from beginning my travels\
  \ to Europe\u2026 so what better place to start.\n\nThis monumental move began on\
  \ the 14th of march 2018 when I said good bye to Australia and boarded my flight\
  \ to the UK. Being terrified of flying made this part even more petrifying, but\
  \ lucky a final good bye night out with friends that didn't end till the dawn glow\
  \ was upon us made falling asleep on this 14 hour flight a lot easier. After 32\
  \ hours of travel I landed in Glasgow. Now this was almost 12 months ago so the\
  \ memories aren't to fresh also an extreme case of jet lag doesn't help, but I remember\
  \ an overwhelming sense of surrealism through the whole trip over and arriving (the\
  \ parts where I was conscious anyway). As cliche as it sounds \u201Cit felt like\
  \ I was in a dream\u201D but it really is the best way of describing the feeling\
  \ of overwhelming thrill and disbelief. \n\nThe thrill certainly took a beating\
  \ when on my second day in Glasgow I picked up an amazing case of food poisoning\
  \ that left me bed ridden for two day and to top it off, this was also over St Patrick\u2019\
  s day! Lucky for me I was staying with my friend Sarah at her Gran\u2019s and we\
  \ all know how grandparents are with their grandchildren, needless to say I was\
  \ sufficiently cared for over the next two days of illness. The other upside of\
  \ this bump in the beginning of my trip was that a couple days kip in bed is enough\
  \ to cure anyones jet lag and I was ready to concur this new and foreign land!\n\
  \nBefore I even had time to properly explore this foreign city me and Sarah (who\
  \ had been living in Glasgow 6 months prior to me arriving) were off to our first\
  \ stop, the Isle Of Skye. For any who don\u2019t know of this beautiful part of\
  \ the world, it is an island off the west coast of the Scottish highlands. To get\
  \ here we had to take a 5 hour, yet again hungover (starting to see a rolling theme)\
  \ bus trip to Inverness. This small coastal city should be on anyone visiting Scotland\
  \ list. Inverness mixing this best of both city and small town in one making for\
  \ a brilliant day trip from the stunning architecture to the chilling river that\
  \ divides the city.\nAfter an impressing day trip I was lucky enough to grab a ride\
  \ with Sarah brother to Skye where Sarah and I would be staying. This is where I\
  \ first knew Scotland was going to be engraved on my heart for good. Everything\
  \ from the crisp life-bringing air entering my lungs to the rolling mountain fields\
  \ scattered with sheep and the occasional small cottage or ruin, leading to the\
  \ shore where the ocean gently lapped the land. I was captured by the beauty of\
  \ this remarkable part of the world, possible why I was later to move their, but\
  \ that is a story is a lot more than 700 words. \nOnce my 5 days of exploring the\
  \ intoxicating beauty of Skye was up, it was time to head back to Glasgow. Now time\
  \ to settle into my new life in this beautiful country and see the hidden treasures\
  \ this city was holding hidden just out of site. but also pick up a job to begin\
  \ saving for more content to add to my travel journal."
