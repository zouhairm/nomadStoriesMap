Text: In 2016,i went to south korea with my best friends. We are muslim, they are
  wearing hijab and i am not wearing hijab. while we were there, we were always the
  center of attention. maybe because there is a Muslim minority country.but in my
  opinion Korea is a country that is Muslim friendly and its people feel amazed and
  respect us well.everyone who met us said my friends were beautiful with their hijab
  and asked me why I wasn't dressed like them. some of them say they are getting more
  beautiful because of the hijab that makes the positive aura in them more radiant.I
  can only say that I am not ready to wear a hijab. even though I know the hijab is
  an obligation for a Muslim.my heart began to flare up because the Korean people
  who were not Muslims only knew the privilege of wearing a hijab. my period which
  in fact knew the law for a Muslim was an obligation instead of feeling ashamed.even
  though wearing a hijab becomes an identity for us as a Muslim, so it's easier when
  looking for halal food.after that I returned to my home country and was determined
  to use hijab. And it was called hidayah. uniquely I got the guidance to be a better
  Muslim in a majority non-Muslim country.
