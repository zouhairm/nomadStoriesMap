Text: "When I was 16 I travelled to the tiny town of Ponte De Lengo which is situated\
  \ in the Italian Alps. The town is a colourful explosion of fresh food, tantalising\
  \ smells and old Italian men shouting at each other from small market stalls. Whether\
  \ they were cursing each other or professing love I may never know. I was completely\
  \ enchanted and kept delving further and further into the town to try to soak up\
  \ as much of the local culture as I could. However, my curiosity gets the better\
  \ of me and I strayed beyond the russet cobble stone paths and winding walls of\
  \ the town into the wide open Alps.  \n\nI was never one to chase adventure. My\
  \ childhood can be determined as sensible and straightforward. Which is why stumbling\
  \ solo in the snow-capped mountains of an Italian town is not where one would expect\
  \ to find me. The bustling streets and hallowed church halls beckoned me back to\
  \ the safety of the travel tourist route and yet I moved onward. Several hours passed\
  \ and I found myself unaware of time. Every step I took I discovered a new world\
  \ of flowers, fauna and breathtaking landscapes. \n\nStanding in front of a mountain\
  \ that seems to have stood since the beginning of time is an awe-inspiring thing.\
  \ At this moment I could have realised how small or insignificant the woes of my\
  \ young teenage life might have been. But that would be too cliche no? Instead,\
  \ I realised how big the world was and how much of it I have yet to see.  How many\
  \ paths I had closed myself off too. \n\nIt was this trip and this moment where\
  \ I discovered my love of travel. That night when I had come back from my grand\
  \ adventure we went for dinner at a beautiful local trattoria. The owners embraced\
  \ us like family, a strange, distant pale and freckled family but family none the\
  \ less. After we had been thoroughly stuffed with rick local delicacies we went\
  \ outside and waited to drive home. I looked up at the sky and saw a literal blanket\
  \ of stars stretched as far as the eye can see. \n\nIt was mesmerising. It is and\
  \ will always be the most beautiful thing I have ever seen. To this day years later\
  \ when I close my eyes, I can immediately recall what it looked like we saw the\
  \ entire galaxy stretched out before us as if we had been swathed in a starry blanket\
  \ by mother nature herself. And yet still I didn't feel insignificant or unimportant,\
  \ I felt safe and secure. I mentioned I was not a risk taker but in this moment\
  \ I fell in love with the world, I realised its beauty and became devoted to it.\
  \ Since then I have taken every single opportunity to explore and experience as\
  \ much as humanly possible. \n\nSo many people only look as far as their front door.\
  \ But what you don't realise is that the person you become when you travel is the\
  \ person you wished you were when you were young. I will never stop travelling,\
  \ I will never stop learning and I will always be deeply in love with the cultures\
  \ and people this world has to offer. \n\nMy story may not be anything more than\
  \ a child walking her first solo footsteps in a mountainscape. But that's the beauty\
  \ of travel. Every day you step outside your door you have the opportunity for adventure.\
  \ You just have to take the first step."
