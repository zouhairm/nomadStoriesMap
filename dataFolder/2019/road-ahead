Text: "I didn't expect to find a new world in a place I never though to see, the North\
  \ of Ireland.  Roads from my place of home  the South off on an adventure of a life\
  \ time to follow the path of a TV show and experience a night before planned road\
  \ trip. Down winding roads that should not exist, flying past rivers lakes oceans\
  \ and creeks. The smell of green from the freshly grown grass the sounds of the\
  \ sheep, down hills on roads you cant see, to standing amongst the bare trees. Sights\
  \ like winter fell a fallen castle to old mansions and seals. TV vs Reality a glimpse\
  \ behind the scene of TV shows so great, playing archery and losing yet smiling\
  \ in defeat as my father \u2018chops\u2019 my head off in victory, my cousin laughs\
  \ on in amusement it all started because of tv shows and a plan the night before.\
  \ \n\nMoving off on a venture to photograph sheep only to get their behinds in wake.\
  \ Taking the easy route by use of the stairs, watching you family take the hardest\
  \ route, seeing in a dim cave that not really cares. Running in the rain to the\
  \ nearest escape route, to seeing the land on which great legend came from, while\
  \ pretty it lacks most you had desired like some things it was just not meant to\
  \ be, to live up to expectation. \n\nOnward we go backwards to seeing car parks\
  \ and murals instead, gone the green and forest of tree instead there is a jungle\
  \ of buildings, seeing the past mixed with the present the rows of flags that tore\
  \ at a country, too see it still plays part in to day society. Seeing the birth\
  \ place of an old ship, with sadness that follows, amazing to see the layout of\
  \ what was and the could have beens of the life that that where lost. \n\nDry that\
  \ tear as all is not lost on ward back to South I go. Memories of the different\
  \ side, part of a different year filled with an air of happiness, disappoint, history\
  \ and fun an unexpected journey that is near and dear to me and shall take a place\
  \ in my heart. A place I would have thought to see with places I never gave a glance\
  \ to nor even new they existed, some time the best is off the beaten path, the unexpected\
  \ can be the best that is what I found. Followed a road and let it take me to place\
  \ I never expected to find."
