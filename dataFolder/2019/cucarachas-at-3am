Text: "The intended plan: go to Honduras, take a week or two of Spanish lessons, take\
  \ day & weekend trips and a few days on the islands.\nPlans shot to sh*te...\n\n\
  Through a friend, I found the shoddy, poorly run Central American Spanish School\
  \ CASA) in Honduras. My friend however, attended classes with a private tutor while\
  \ she learned to Scuba dive on Utila Island. I signed up for classes at the main\
  \ school in La Ceiba, Honduras, yet I only attended two days. My experienced teacher\
  \ Karla, was the only redeeming factor relating to this school.  \n\nThe school\
  \ is located in the Sauce neighborhood of the city La Ceiba. There is nothing in\
  \ Sauce. It is a tiny community area, with fenced in homes, it does not even have\
  \ any restaurants. Though it is far from the central part of the city, the good\
  \ news is that taxis can be taken all over the city for 20 limpiras. (Which is equivalent\
  \ to one US dollar.) \n\nThe school tries to keep the students sheltered from the\
  \ rest of the city- the director promotes the city mall as a place to purchase needed\
  \ items and use the bank. The school also provides opportunities to take day trips-\
  \ at a grossly overpriced rate with their own tour guide. After only a little bit\
  \ of research I found that I could venture on these trips without the necessity\
  \ of their creepy tour guide.\n\nLa Ceiba is the third largest city in Honduras\
  \ and you need to take the usual travel precautions/cautions. (i.e; Do not walk\
  \ around alone at night, do not act like a loudmouth idiot tourist. Take taxis.\
  \ Pay attention to your surroundings. Do not get inebriated while you are out...\
  \ And females always need to be especially alert in any foreign country.)\n\nFortunately,\
  \ I met an awesome young woman from the states at the host family's sparse, dirty,\
  \ cockroach infested home. She offered me a few tidbits of information about the\
  \ family and her disgust with their lack of interest in their guests as well as\
  \ unhelpful and at times rude behavior.\n\nMy American friend explained that cockroaches\
  \ explored the home nightly and that she sprayed her room with Raid daily. Although\
  \ she advised me to do the same, I did not bother to follow her suggestion.\n\n\
  After two nights in my dingy room, I had not seen nor heard any of the large creepy\
  \ crawly insects, I thought perhaps those nasty things kept out of my room. During\
  \ the third night, I suddenly awoke around 3am, because I had a very vivid dream.\
  \ In my sleepy-awake state, I felt something crawling on my chest, only to find...something\
  \ crawling on my chest. Yep, I opened my eyes to find a 2 inch brown cockroach slowly\
  \ moving towards my face.  Horrified, I flung the beast off of me and jumped into\
  \ the middle of the bedroom. My heart beat at an abnormally high rate and I scanned\
  \ the concrete floors and walls for the culprit. Finally, I found the violator of\
  \ my sleep and dashed to my new friend's room and borrowed her can of cucaracha\
  \ killer. As I drowned the poor sucker in the vile liquid, I hate to admit my satisfaction\
  \ as it writhed on it's back with its many legs moving slowly. The thing's legs\
  \ wriggled until finally, it ceased to live.\n\nSleepless, I sat in the middle of\
  \ the next room on one of the cheap plastic lawn chairs. Until dawn, I remained\
  \ on vigilant watch for some of the dead insect's family members.\n\nExhausted,\
  \ I made my way into town, withdrew cash from the automated machine and made phone\
  \ calls to hostels. After I consulted my guide book I decided to head off into the\
  \ jungle. I reasoned, if I was to encounter large insects, at least they would be\
  \ exotic ones. That afternoon I ditched the host family and caught a pick-up truck\
  \ with some other travelers off for a jungle adventure."
