Text: "THE SHORES OF THE INDIAN OCEAN.\nMaking a Local Connection.\nA very hot place\
  \ no doubt have your bottle or tube of sunscreen with you, and that is a must have,\
  \ because if not careful the heat down at the Coast could give you a different layer\
  \ of skin that is just sun burns.\nLocated along the Coastline we find a place with\
  \ beautiful beaches, white sands as white as the Sands of Chale an Island on the\
  \ Indian Ocean also just at the Coast with a beach that anyone would choose there\
  \ last days to be spent on, not forgetting the breezy palm trees that are ideal\
  \ to seat under and just watch the tides at sea rise and fall from dawn to dusk.\
  \ Catch the sunrise and Sunset at my best spot which was at The English Point Marina,\
  \ it rises and sets beyond the ocean waters leaving the skies with a deep orange\
  \ or light purple hue. The aesthetic at the Coast gives one a warm feeling of romance,\
  \ best place to go on a honeymoon or vacation with a significant other the vibe\
  \ in the air is one of love through and through. \nThe food is a delicacy and the\
  \ variety is so wide you can never try it all out. Raging from local cuisine which\
  \ is the most affordable, finger licking and flavourful because of the assortment\
  \ of spices used to marinate and prepare the dishes made locally and purchased at\
  \ the spice market in Mombasa Old Town. These when taking an evening walk l would\
  \ always find myself stopping by the women along the road who are the local vendors\
  \ just to indulge. And now for the international cuisine which mainly consists of\
  \ sea food and which is the priciest cuisine at the Coast. From prawns, to lobsters,\
  \ to octopus, to calamari, to oysters the list is endless. Personally have never\
  \ tried sea food before and visiting the Coast it bids purpose to get in touch with\
  \ everything and that includes food. Therefore I dared to try out their specialty\
  \ which was sea food and kid you not I did not regret it. And just a tip I\u2019\
  d love to share visiting new places no matter how close or far it is from home and\
  \ you have an option of preparing meals by yourself I\u2019d advise you not to.\
  \ Try out their food its part of keeping in touch with their culture. Not forgetting\
  \ the very cute spaces they have as restaurants and coffee shops some just overlooking\
  \ the ocean and some even on the ocean called floating restaurants like The Moorings\
  \ floating restaurant the views and the ambience were simply breath taking.\n Their\
  \ culture is intriguing and some of their habits interesting. In one word I\u2019\
  d sum it up to them being lovers of life and loving the fine things in life which\
  \ I\u2019d mostly say just being on holiday all their life. They dance to the beat\
  \ of West African drums like they will never dance again, as though it is their\
  \ last dance. They move to the beats in a beautiful rhythmic pace that catches the\
  \ eye and keeps it glued to the performance and when it\u2019s over leaves the eye\
  \ begging for more. And one of the habits I noticed they have is doing things in\
  \ a slow way. They move in slow graceful walks and just perform tasks naturally\
  \ at their own pace. To them there is no hurry in life. Their historical sites that\
  \ make part of their culture are very educational. I also very much loved their\
  \ locally made artefacts that l took back home as souvenirs in memory of a beautiful\
  \ culture rich place l once visited.\n\nAnd about their culture I mostly loved how\
  \ polite and friendly they are always willing to assist and guide. Gave me a feeling\
  \ of being at home away from home and never once did I ever feel out of place or\
  \ like I missed home more than I was supposed to."
