Text: "I stood at the water\u2019s edge along the glitter strip of the Gold Coast.\
  \ Lost, confused, alone. I prayed to all the gods I didn\u2019t believe in, I asked\
  \ for the answer, my heart and I didn\u2019t know what was next, how could I continue\
  \ without a companion by my side\u2026\nIn the morning I was shunted awake by a\
  \ strong inner voice, \u201Cgo to India\u201D! The directive was crystal clear!\
  \ I felt purpose had arrived for me, at the very least\u2026An escape.\nFlights\
  \ were booked, a birthday present to my-self. \n\nIt was 3am in the morning when\
  \ Mehar was scheduled to meet me outside the New Delhi terminal. I was struck by\
  \ anxiety in the sea of drivers with handwritten signs welcoming \u201Cme\u201D\
  \ to their land\u2026\nI arrive by private taxi into Paharganj at four in the morning.\
  \ I see the road covered in an orange hue from a mix of dust and dawns approach.\
  \ Sleeping rickshaw drivers and scattered dogs decorate the streets\u2026 \nBy early\
  \ morning I am in Baljitnagar, bordering the slums. My senses are assaulted, but\
  \ I am just an onlooker.\n\nBy late evening I am at Kashmiri gate, headed on a Volvo\
  \ overnight bus to the state of Himachal Pradesh, morning comes and I arrive in\
  \ Shimla, I then transfer to a jeep whose carrying capacity seems to be the equivalent\
  \ of the bus ride, packed in like sardines I head off\u2026 \n\nElated after reaching\
  \ my final stop, I look up at the steep climb before me. Hiking for an hour arrives\
  \ me at Shiri village, a group of houses nestled in between Himachal\u2019s famous\
  \ high-altitude apple orchards and provocative cannabis plants. I meet my new family,\
  \ 15 people spread across three houses. I sit down for my first dinner with them,\
  \ chapatis, beans, rice and  smiles\u2026 I go to bed with an unsatisfied palate,\
  \ as I lay my head to the ground, the 8 gigantic spiders surrounding me reset my\
  \ fullness.  \n\nThe next day I awake and head to a nearby school, I was to be the\
  \ teaching the younger children English.\"So, you're here to teach..?\" Trying to\
  \ pacify the energetic erratic children with the presence of a tourist in the room\
  \ was about as practical as turning up at the train station with a waitlisted ticket.\
  \ No one could understand the kiwi slur\u2026 I am told to go home and try another\
  \ school. The next day I try a much larger school 3 hours walk away. \u201CWatch\
  \ out for leopards\u201D, I am told they have been coming and taking cows at night\
  \ from neighbouring villages. I do see a dead cow with a venue of vultures, sparking\
  \ excitement that this is a fresh kill from an Indian leopard (I learn later that\
  \ the cow had fallen down the steep hill). I walk into one class and begin trying\
  \ to teach English, yet again no one can understand, I am sent to sit in the playing\
  \ field. Lunch time comes, I watch the field flood of crimson uniforms as boys and\
  \ girls and play. \n\nMy volunteer teaching career has died before it had a chance.\
  \ It was decided since I am incapable to teach the children, I will join the family\
  \ of local farmers to harvest feed for the cows over winter. Awoken by the sound\
  \ of Aunty churning butter, armed with a sickle, I would head out to the high hills\
  \ every morning and cut a heap of grass. Midday thirst would send me back home for\
  \ the treat of a freshly picked kheera (cucumber). The afternoons were spent herding,\
  \ whiling away in the fields of the great Himalayan Cedar as I kept watch of the\
  \ grazing goats\u2026\nThe plan of teaching in India was flipped, it became the\
  \ immersion of the practices of the Shiri village people. \n\n\nOn reflection, I\
  \ realize how vivid these experiences are to me. This subject has highlighted to\
  \ me how important it is to relieve those scenes through the art of storytelling\
  \ using the medium of the written word, so they can live on for oneself and for\
  \ others."
