Text: "Volcanoes, it\u2019s true, are not dormant in Ecuador; they have lives of their\
  \ own, and stories. And Nelson would tell them. He sat beside me in the first row\
  \ of seats behind the bus driver. His hair was gelled and combed back. His polo\
  \ shirt stretched taught on his belly. We were leaving the cloud forest; the student\
  \ group for which I was responsible was nearing the end of their visit to Ecuador\
  \ and as we left, Nelson, who had lived his whole life among these mountains, told\
  \ the story of a broken heart.\n        \u201CThe clouds are to blame for Imbabura\
  \ Volcano\u2019s perpetual ire,\u201D Nelson said. \u201CYou see, Imbabura and Cotocachi\
  \ Volcano were lovers. Novios. Cotocachi sent messages to Imbabura by way of the\
  \ spectacled bear and the condor. Twirl your skirts, he wrote to her. I\u2019ll\
  \ love you for always.\u201D \nI translated for the students, Spanish to English.\
  \ Some were carsick. Some could have cared less about anything save the approach\
  \ of wifi signal after a week without electricity. But some, like me, delighted\
  \ in Nelson\u2019s tales, his dimpled, joking smile. These students sensed Nelson\u2019\
  s utter coolness, his authority of belonging, even through a language they did not\
  \ speak. \n\t\u201CWell, soon Imbabura stilled her skirts; Cotocachi was cheating\
  \ on her with another volcano from the south. When the clouds came up from the sea\
  \ to cover him from the gaze of Imbabura, Cotocatchi snuck visits to Volc\xE1n Pichincha,\
  \ who reigns over the city of Quito. He had seen how Pichincha wore houses and churches\
  \ on her neck at night like blazing diamonds. She was flashier, certainly, than\
  \ Imbabura, who wrapped herself in only a plaid patchwork of fields.\u201D\n\tThe\
  \ suspension of the bus groaned as we descended on the rutted road. I was adding\
  \ flourish to the story. I had been working as a guide for three months and had\
  \ heard it many times over. I had begun to make it partly my own. But was there\
  \ anything I could rightly claim, I wondered, in this role of translator? We passed\
  \ a red field of quinoa, pastured sheep and alpaca. We passed groupings of cinderblock\
  \ houses. Women in black skirts and white blouses swept their yards, with small\
  \ lumps of wrapped babies snug on their backs.\n\t\u201CThere she is,\u201D Nelson\
  \ said. He pointed through the windshield at Imbabura. \u201CDo you see where her\
  \ heart has been torn away?\u201D\n\tTwo-thirds of the way up the side of Imbabura,\
  \ past the point of inflection where farming proved impossible, a wide brown gash\
  \ opened. It was an enormous landslide; a part of the mountain had collapsed. \n\
  \t\u201CWhat really did it,\u201D Nelson said, \u201CWhat really tore Imbabura\u2019\
  s heart out of her massive, geologic body, was the way she found out about Cotocachi\u2019\
  s infidelity: Volc\xE1n Pichincha had a baby.\u201D\n\tA few of the kids in the\
  \ back had taken their earbuds out of their ears. They saw the others pointing to\
  \ the mountain. \n       \u201CTourists,\u201D Nelson said, \u201Cvisiting the town\
  \ of Ba\xF1os can see the baby mountain roiling in lava. They can bathe in the hot\
  \ springs heated by his temper tantrums. Imbabura hears the truth from the rumblings\
  \ of the volcano rumor mill. The pain of Cotocatchi\u2019s infidelity is so great\
  \ that she tears out her own heart in a bloodletting, a scree of rock.\u201D\n\t\
  Nelson sat back and let me finish the story for the students. I was kneeling then,\
  \ backward in my seat, pretending to rip my own heart out of my chest as I told\
  \ them the ending; No one had earbuds in now. Oh, but how I wanted those kids to\
  \ love Ecuador as much as I did! And so I embellished, and in my act was every embarrassing\
  \ tell of my unprofessional bias. I was afraid of this: that to make the story my\
  \ own, to claim that I, myself, loved Cotacachi\u2014and had landslides all over\
  \ my body as a result\u2014that this would be laughed at as outrageous, melodramatic\
  \ fiction, would expose me as so much more than just a translator.  \n\t\u201CCotocachi\
  \ tries to get Imbabura back,\u201D Nelson said, now just to me. \u201CHe sends\
  \ Imbabura lightning. But she wraps herself in storms, she thunders.\u201D"
