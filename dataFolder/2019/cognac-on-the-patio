Text: "After a couple hours in the car, and a quick stop at a supermarche in a nearby\
  \ town, we found ourselves in the cozy village of Cambremer, France. We unloaded\
  \ groceries and luggage and headed inside to check out the half of a stone home\
  \ we had rented for the week.  Stone walls, exposed beams, and weathered wooden\
  \ floors juxtaposed easily with the sleek modern kitchen appliances. We quickly\
  \ went to work on dinner, eager to eat and relax. The pizza we made wasn\u2019t\
  \ fancy, just simple premade crust and jarred sauce as the base, but it was made\
  \ richer with local toppings and whole milk fresh mozzarella. \nGrabbing plates\
  \ and pizzas, we headed out to the patio. There we enjoyed a relaxed meal and a\
  \ bottle of local cidre, chatting about our plans for the week. Plans to visit the\
  \ famed tapestry in Bayeux  and Monet\u2019s garden were marked on the calendar.\
  \ \nSoon we were joined outside by the owner of the home, who happened to be visiting\
  \ from London. He shared with us a bit of background about the town and poured generous\
  \ glasses of cognac. The conversation wandered from travel and personal histories\
  \ to celebrity gossip and the horror of American politics naturally, as if we\u2019\
  d all known each other for a lifetime. When darkness finally fell, we said good\
  \ night and headed inside. \nThe next day we toured  the area, returning in time\
  \ for supper. The town was small, with only two restaurants to which we could walk.\
  \ It was early for the evening meal by French standards, but the nearest restaurant\
  \ was already fully booked. The other lacked a fancy exterior but had room for our\
  \ group of four. We were quickly ushered out to a patio nestled in a private courtyard.\
  \ As soon as we were seated a clay pitcher of the house red appeared. The menu options\
  \ were limited,salmon with sorrel sauce, steak au poivre, and a forgettable chicken\
  \ dish. We ordered steak and salmon and tucked into our second pitcher. As we chatted,\
  \ a small window opened into the courtyard. The chef nodded to us and turned his\
  \ attention back to the food. As our conversation continued, we were enchanted to\
  \ hear quiet singing from the window. The chef sang and whistled while he worked,\
  \ his happiness apparent. It felt almost to perfect to be real. \nWhen our food\
  \ arrived, it became clear that music was not his only gift. Our table fell silent\
  \ as we took our first bites, knowing ,even then, that years later we would still\
  \ be searching for fresh sorrel and green peppercorns in brine to recreate this\
  \ meal.\nAfter paying our bill, a shockingly reasonable final tab, we headed back\
  \ to our rental, slightly disappointed to find the patio uninhabited. We grabbed\
  \ bottles of cidre and glasses, and sat ourselves in the plastic chairs outside.\
  \ A while later, our cheerful neighbor joined us, this time with calvados to share.\
  \ Again we filled the French night with laughter and comraderie.   \nIt is these\
  \ simple moments, that over a decade later still enchant, serving as a reminder\
  \ that Tolkien was correct in his observation that, \u201CIf more of us valued food\
  \ and cheer and song above hoarded gold, the world would be a merrier place,\u201D"
