Text: "I smiled intently as the first traces of cold air hit my face. The wind made\
  \ its way swiftly through the window and came straight for me, like it was meant\
  \ for me. The windy terrain was so unfamiliar but so were the rocks we had passed\
  \ and which were now behind us. These rocks of course were not going to be the last\
  \ we would meet. I had been told that the town we now approached was full of them.\
  \ The cold was stunning. When I started to see the first mountaintop houses, I adjusted\
  \ for the ride. It was during this stretch of time that I discovered for the first\
  \ time how uniquely endowed each of the towns we passed were. This cold wind that\
  \ now hits me was different, spectacular, and ecstatic. I did not know what to expect\
  \ moments from now. I did not know what Jos would bring, for me. But here I was\
  \ expecting the best. Here I was hoping that this warm welcome that nature gave\
  \ me was indicative of good things. I was just stepping into new territory.\n\n\
  When we met the slender plants, our driver announced that we were now on the Plateau.\
  \ The plants pointed upwards and had rough thorny edges. Many of the houses here\
  \ seemed to have them as fencing. I soon realized they were really just farms. I\
  \ was perplexed at how much there was for me to learn. Everyone in the bus was visiting\
  \ the Plateau for the first time.\n\n\t\u201CIt\u2019s Riyom,\u201D the driver announced.\n\
  \nHe got giggles in response. He was still trying to entertain his passengers when\
  \ the bus stopped. We were within reach of Jos, he explained. He parked the vehicle\
  \ and went off in search of someone that could fix it. We waited patiently. Night\
  \ was falling rather fast. When he returned an hour later, he explained that we\
  \ were not likely to beat the curfew. We exchanged glances across the bus before\
  \ someone asked what curfew he was talking about.\n\n\t\u201CWe would be sleeping\
  \ over at Marabajawa,\u201D he explained.\n\nFrom that moment, we all felt like\
  \ the vehicle was crawling. \u201CHow could it be so slow?\u201D But our driver\
  \ sped off nonetheless. He navigated through the darkness with expertise and ease.\
  \ We were all getting exhausted. The roads were dark. Only the headlights illuminated\
  \ the way. From the streets in Riyom, we had joined a highway and we had all become\
  \ apprehensive. The weather was still cold. Our driver had pulled on a sweater.\
  \ The rest of us just shivered. We were ill prepared for this. When a University\
  \ finally calls you, little else mattered. All you wanted was to secure your space\
  \ and finally become a student. The curfews, the cold or the roads did not matter.\
  \ We were so ignorant and perhaps overjoyed and did not know the precise distance\
  \ we were covering. Although we had set out before dawn, here we were after nightfall\
  \ still plying the quiet road and wondering why the hours added up and increased\
  \ rather than reduced. Each time, our driver would say we had thirty minutes to\
  \ get to Jos, but it quickly became two hours and more. Some of my fellow boarders\
  \ were asleep now. The weather no longer mattered, the rocks no longer mattered\
  \ and the strange plants did not matter either. I just wanted to get off this bus\
  \ and settle into a comfortable bed for my first night in Jos.\n\nThis was not to\
  \ happen though because as we got to Marabajawa, we met other vehicles there all\
  \ parked. People were either seating or standing or sleeping. We were past curfew\
  \ time. Our driver maneuvered his way to a comfortable parking position and turned\
  \ off the ignition key. Here was our destination for tonight. We continue tomorrow.\
  \ We leap into the unknown as soon as the first trace of light reaches us. Here\
  \ was where we would be spending the night.\n\n\t\u201CWhy is there a curfew anyway?\u201D\
  \ I asked whoever was ready to listen.\n\t\u201CThere\u2019s been a lingering war.\
  \ The Government is trying to curb it,\u201D someone answered from behind me.\n\t\
  \u201CHere, you might need a blanket,\u201D he added."
