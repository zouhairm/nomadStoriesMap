Text: "As I stepped off the plane, I was overwhelmingly surprised by the silence.\
  \ Chants of 'taxi, taxi' did not ring in the air unlike so many other arrival gates\
  \ on the continent. Instead, and rather preferably, I was greeted with the sounds\
  \ of elevator music, a popular genre in Brunei. This set the expectation of the\
  \ next 4 days.\n\nDay 1\nI checked into my \u2018hostel\u2019. I would have been\
  \ deluded if I imagined that a hostel in Brunei would be similar to any other in\
  \ South East Asia. The hostel lacked any type of party vibe probably because there\
  \ were no Aussies around, or rather, because Sharia Law in the kingdom prohibited\
  \ the selling of alcohol. I was later to learn that this was because The Sultan\
  \ (Hassanal Bolkiah) had become wearier of the afterlife in his old age and thus\
  \ was attempting to repent his sins by implementing the law in October 2013. Things\
  \ had not always been this way. I comforted myself by pretending it was the lack\
  \ of Aussies.\n\nDay 2\nI finally plucked up the energy to venture outside the four\
  \ cardboard walls where I was staying. As I aimlessly walked around the overly pristine\
  \ streets, I stumbled into Omar Ali Saifuddien Mosque. Along with The Golden Temple\
  \ in India, it was probably one of the most beautiful places of worship I have ever\
  \ seen. An elderly local decided to show me around and I couldn\u2019t refuse. He\
  \ had after all just saved me from a car as I attempted to cross the road to reach\
  \ the Mosque and its golden dome. After the tour around the Mosque, he bid me farewell\
  \ and I strolled into \u2018the heart\u2019 of the city. Expecting to find a buzz,\
  \ I instead found a solitary man drawing, a KFC and a big shopping centre. \n\n\
  Day 3\n\u2018Miss Lionnel, you must go here before you leave!\u2019. The Receptionist\
  \ at the \u2018hostel\u2019 pointed at a map of the city marked water village and\
  \ mangroves. I asked where it was, and he indicated outside the window. It was literally\
  \ a street crossing away. When I reached the waterfront, I found all the cries of\
  \ \u2018taxi\u2019 missing from the airport were in fact hidden here. Eventually,\
  \ I picked a man who took me on a tour at a reasonable price. First stop, The Mangroves.\
  \ This really was beautiful and for a moment I felt as though I was in paradise.\
  \ The vibrant green of the trees and the murky brown waters were really a perfect\
  \ match for the eyes. This was only slightly ruined when the tour guide told me\
  \ that crocodiles lived in the waters. Nevertheless, things picked up again when\
  \ we spotted an incredibly unique looking monkey: the proboscis monkey. Famed for\
  \ its funny, phallic shaped nose the monkey didn\u2019t seem bothered by us at all.\n\
  After 20 minutes downstream, we headed up to the water village. This is where the\
  \ life was. Children were laughing and running along the narrow bridges made of\
  \ old wooden planks that connected the rickety houses on stilts. Friends were idly\
  \ chatting. The water village even had its own school on stilts! Above all, there\
  \ was noise. It felt like a completely different country. It was only when we travelled\
  \ 5 minutes to cross to the waterfront, I remembered it was part of the same city.\n\
  \n Day 4\nDeparture day. After the previous day, I felt guilty of my sweeping preconception\
  \ of the Kingdom\u2019s capital. However, it was slightly justified again when the\
  \ receptionist told me that everything closes from 12pm to 2pm on a Friday due to\
  \ prayer.  I decided before leaving, to have another quick peek at the mosque and\
  \ visit the \u2018Royal Regalia Museum\u2019. The museum exhibited all The Sultan\u2019\
  s unwanted treasure and I was welcomed by a room-sized, golden chariot. I wondered\
  \ what his wanted treasure was like if this was his unwanted.\nBy the time it reached\
  \ 12, absolutely everything has closed and the prayers at the mosque echoed through\
  \ the city. During this time, I boarded the bus to Miri and exited Brunei with pop\
  \ music in my ears."
