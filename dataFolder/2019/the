Text: "I opened my eyes, unsure of where I am, again. It's the fourth time this week,\
  \ tenth this month. Traveling is a hard affair; although most people back home would\
  \ have staged a protest and called me an ungrateful donkey. \n\nBudapest was an\
  \ interesting city to arrive to. When my bus pulled into Nepliget - the People's\
  \ Park bus station - I was instantly reminded of a swanky, clean bus station in\
  \ Malaysia, where I was from. But once I stepped off the bus, the biting cold and\
  \ the smell of marijuana became my first sensations in Budapest. It was definitely\
  \ different than I remembered.\n\nI had been here before, specifically three months\
  \ ago, when I was chasing love across Europe. I had fallen in love with a man, and\
  \ that romanticism extended to include the city. I indulged myself in the tourist\
  \ attractions the last time I was here. Heroes' Square, the giant square bordered\
  \ with the statues of Hungarian kings, saw the rise and fall of my romance. Margit\
  \ Island, where I sat on the grass for the first time of my life and threw my head\
  \ back to laugh like the diversity posters of my university. My first taste of goulash,\
  \ which is underwhelming, to say the least. Budapest had seen many of my firsts\
  \ and my first time here had painted a beautiful picture of it all.\n\nIt's time\
  \ to rediscover the city on my own terms. \n\nIt was 6 pm when I decided to leave\
  \ the house. I live in the 8th district, the most ghetto district in Budapest city\
  \ center. I was supposed to go to Aurora, an underground bar/ event venue that hosted\
  \ the most hipster-sounding event. It was a quick 15-minute walk through the roughest\
  \ part of the 8th district. \"Never go there by yourself,\" warned my new flatmates.\
  \ Guess who's going by herself? \n\nThe first thing I noticed was the copious amount\
  \ of trash scattered by either side of the streets. Scavengers dug through the mountains\
  \ of sofas, desks and box spring mattresses. The weirdest part is, the gypsies aren't\
  \ the only ones paying attention to trash. At points of my walk, I've noticed people\
  \ picking up bits and pieces that they're interested in. A woman picked up a lamp.\
  \ A man dressed in a suit said something excitedly in Hungarian to his friend and\
  \ they both started dragging a broken armchair out of the pile. Two gypsies wrestling\
  \ over a pile of timber that another gypsy had ripped out of desks. To say that\
  \ it's bizarre is an understatement. \n\nThe familiar smell of weed wafts around\
  \ me as I walked closer to Aurora. It's settled in an interesting mix of a neighborhood,\
  \ surrounded by either incredibly new-looking buildings or old communist blocks.\
  \ Loud, colorful flyers adorned the entryway, promoting events that the bar is hosting.\
  \ The drag queen party looked incredibly promising - maybe that's a good plan for\
  \ next Saturday. I got myself a beer and hung around by the main bar for a while.\
  \ It's refreshing that no one is staring at me or trying to talk to me. People seemed\
  \ really chill and respectful here. \n\nWe got herded into the basement for the\
  \ language discussion that we were here for. It really shows the diversity of the\
  \ expat community in Budapest. The host of the meetup is an Israeli-American linguist.\
  \ People in my group were made up of Indians, Arabs, Germans, and English. And boy,\
  \ was the discussion intense. Turns out bonding over a shared understanding of languages\
  \ and a couple pints of beers is the best. When the meeting ended, I walked away\
  \ with a couple of new Facebook friends and a newfound appreciation for the city.\
  \ \n\nThe walk home was pretty uneventful, save for the fact that it's much darker\
  \ now and the streets aren't exactly well lit. Despite a few intimidating stares\
  \ from homeless bums, I've noticed that I don't feel unsafe at all. It's definitely\
  \ not as pretty as my skewed memories made it out to be, but I love a little chaos\
  \ in my cities. Budapest and I will get along just fine."
