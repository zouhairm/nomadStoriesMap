Text: "Shadows darkened, as the sun slowly slunk out of sight, the fading light cast\
  \ a gray haze over the brumal late March landscape. The warm low light brightened\
  \ inside the small cafe that had welcomed us with a comforting allure, after another\
  \ long day navigating endless serpentine roads. This kismet cafe was even more endearing\
  \ and reassuring than the gentle Icelandic Horses that would intermittently be spotted\
  \ alongside the smooth paved highway that circumvented the island\u2019s increasingly\
  \ well known Golden Circle. \n\n     Aga, the friendly waitress that took our orders\
  \ and made small talk about our adventures thus far. We spoke of the incredible\
  \ Svartivoss waterfalls in the South and the museum of witchcraft and sorcery that\
  \ we had visited in the North. She smiled a bright smile and nodded. We shared how\
  \ we were feebly attempting to catch the Northern Lights, late in the season as\
  \ it were and find as many hot springs as we could. \n\n     At this her face changed,\
  \ \u201CYou are looking for hot springs?\u201D\n     My trusted companion and I\
  \ smiled knowingly at one another. Her eyes searched us briefly, darted around the\
  \ small room and she left to make a phone call. When she returned her voice was\
  \ hushed as she pressed a small note with an address in my hand. She told us, it\u2019\
  s not really open, but it is ok if we went there. It wasn\u2019t far from the cafe,\
  \ as she had promised, the road rough, narrow and unlit. \n\n\tWe arrived at a compound\
  \ of a sorts, a wide low ranch house. Upon entering we found ourselves in a largely\
  \ empty space being built out. Aga, introduced us to our enthusiastic host who showed\
  \ us the work in progress; the unfinished wood countertop he had just built, where\
  \ he wanted to put the juice bar and eventually have snacks. He told us that this\
  \ is the oldest hot spring in Iceland. Built in 1891, it had gone through a period\
  \ of high popularity and then fell into disuse. \n\n      Outside, the night air\
  \ descended upon us, there was a flat concrete patio area that went up to the rough\
  \ cut natural rocks that framed the edge of the pool. He pointed out the changing\
  \ building across the pool that had resided there since the 1920s. We were overjoyed\
  \ at this vast ink black pool before us, with its delicate steam lifting off the\
  \ surface, reminiscent of a perfect cup of tea. In the darkness, we were denied\
  \ the gorgeous landscape that stretched, rolling in every direction but were granted\
  \ the breathtaking sea of stars that swam above us. Far from any light pollution,\
  \ we had only the waning moon\u2019s reflection on the water to distract from the\
  \ scatter shot of starlight. \n\n      It has come to pass that the Secret Lagoon,\
  \ has found much success and is no longer a secret at all. Swimming late into the\
  \ night in those soothing warm waters with our new friends, we got to share the\
  \ secret before it was out."
