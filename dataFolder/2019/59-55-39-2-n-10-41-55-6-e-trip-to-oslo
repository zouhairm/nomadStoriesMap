Text: "When my brother won a scholarship to Oslo I thought \"Wow! That is an amazing\
  \ place\", and at the same time making a trip to Norway looked like a really far\
  \ away dream. But then came Christmas and something so unexpected an amazing happened.\
  \ My aunt's Christmas gift for me was a trip to, can you guess it? Yes! A trip to\
  \ Norway. Such an amazing and inspiring gift, I was touched.\nAt March 7th, 2018\
  \ we arrived in Oslo at the most freezing night, my brother came to meet us at the\
  \ airport. We took the subway to his station and walk all the way to get to his\
  \ flat. I just remember thinking \u201CThe adventure was just beginning\u201D.\n\
  In the first morning, I had the strangest feeling, I had the impression of being\
  \ inside of one little snow globes that you shake and snow falls under the colorful\
  \ houses. The scene from the window was exactly the same! \nAfter a good breakfast,\
  \ we start our journey to the city. We visited the Akershus fortress, a medieval\
  \ castle built at 1290 and a resistance symbol for the Norwegian people. Today the\
  \ building has museums. Also, it's possible to walk through the historical constructions.\
  \ And the view of the sea and the city is breathtaking.\nAnother amazing place close\
  \ to the Akershus Fortress is Oslo City Hall. The building, besides being an administrative\
  \ center of the City, is also an artistic and historical monument. The outside wall\
  \ has many Wooden Friezes with themes of the Norse mythology such as the 'Valkyries',\
  \ the 'Goddesses of Destiny'. A very interesting thing, is that there are sculptures\
  \ with tributes to workers of the country, not big important famous people, but\
  \ the hard working people that helped build the country! As I stepped in I saw that\
  \ the place was filled with works of Norwegian artists. Each wall is a frame that\
  \ portrays and the history of the country and the origin of the people.\nAnother\
  \ amazing place to go is \u2018Vigelands Park' inside the Frogner park. It is one\
  \ of the biggest sculptures parks in the world. It has more than 200 sculptures\
  \ of Gustav Vigeland. There was so much peace in the air, it was truly amazing.\
  \ The day we went there, the place was cover with snow, and the sculptures seems\
  \ magnificent monuments under the \u2018white floor\u2019. Vigelands has a very\
  \ keen sense for human characteristics. It portrays people of different ages in\
  \ different forms and movements. You can feel the emotion expressed by the sculptures.\
  \ And they have such a realistic shapes that you feel like they could talk at any\
  \ moment. \nOslo give a lot of surprises for me. My brother's friends invite me\
  \ to the ski, borrow me the equipment and took me to the Winter Park, at the neighborhood\
  \ Tryvann. Miguel and Kirsten teach me the basic movements with the legs, and what\
  \ you have to do to ski. I slip on the ice a hundred times. They just said, \"Get\
  \ up. Get up and try again. You can do it\".  I tried the 'green' mountain. the\
  \ first time, slip on a lot of times, I was so afraid. In my whole life, I had never\
  \ pictured that. On the second time, I tried again and I could stand longer than\
  \ before. I was so afraid and scary. And in the third time, \"Oh my God\" I skied.\
  \ It felt like victory. This experience definitively is the biggest 'leap into the\
  \ unknown' of my life.\nDuring the trip, it was happening the Ski Festival in Holmenkollen.\
  \ Three days of competitions from the ski arena and cross-country ski all around\
  \ Holmenkollen jump. Oslo wasn't the same in this day. In every part, people were\
  \ talking and laughing. Families and group of friends having fun. The subway was\
  \ crowded. It is an unusual day in Norway. I admired this enthusiasm.  It seems\
  \ like the passion of Brazilians with soccer. Amazing. \nTo sum up, Oslo is a magical\
  \ place, with brave and courageous energy all around the place. An artistic and\
  \ historical place that preserve the good values of the people. Also preserve the\
  \ nature and the authentic beauty."
