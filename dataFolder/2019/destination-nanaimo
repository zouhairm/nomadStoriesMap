Text: "My heart dropped and my chest tightened as I realized that my debit card was\
  \ not working, even though I had called before I left on my trip. Was it my card\
  \ or the train ticket machine that was not working? This was only the beginning\
  \ of a very adventurous day. My day started at 4:30 am, when I heard my alarm go\
  \ off, this was it, I was heading off on my first solo trip. In a few short hours,\
  \ I would be in Vancouver, Canada. I jumped out of bed and got ready as quickly\
  \ as I could. Still making sure that I had everything that I needed, checked my\
  \ passport twice and all my cash/ debit card. Once passed security at the airport,\
  \ it was all on me, no one else to rely on. The sky was pitch black and that just\
  \ made me feel even more sleepy, but I was also nervous and excited. All that planning\
  \ and saving was paying off. Around 7:20 I was able to board my flight, I thought\
  \ I was in my seat, but I realized mine was across the way, woops\u2026 I felt bad\
  \ having to disturb the guy in the aisle seat once again plus having to go by two\
  \ people to get to my window seat. I got a window seat though, that means I would\
  \ get to see Vancouver as we landed!! Once landing I immediately headed to customs,\
  \ cleared it and picked up my bag from the luggage carousel. Walking out of airport,\
  \ I was immediately enveloped in that sweet smell of rain, unique to the North-\
  \ West region of the U.S. . It was quite chilly, but I was bundled up nicely and\
  \ did not mind much. I boldly walked into the rain, across the street, up the escalator\
  \ to the Skytrain. Even though my card would not work in the ticket machine, I would\
  \ not let it ruin my trip. I found the nearest ATM, got some cash and went back\
  \ and bought my ticket. My journey was officially beginning! It was a struggle maneuvering\
  \ local transportation, especially getting to Nanaimo on Vancouver Island. Getting\
  \ to the ferry terminal was easy enough, a light rain was falling as I got to the\
  \ terminal. After two and half hours on the ferry, I made it to Nanaimo!  Taking\
  \ off from the Vancouver ferry port, surrounded by the lush green hills, will stay\
  \ in my memories forever.  The rain made it look magical! Bursting with excitement,\
  \ I accidently got on the wrong bus, instead of going past my hostel it headed for\
  \ the local mall. Panic slowly rose in my chest, but the nice bus lady told me to\
  \ jump on the bus just ahead of us. She gave me a bus pass for my troubles, I quickly\
  \ ran and jumped on the other bus. Thankfully, this bus was going directly past\
  \ my hostel, in fact the bus stop is just right outside the main entrance. I breathed\
  \ a sigh of relief upon entering the hostel main lobby, grateful to be greeted by\
  \ one of staff members. It was so homey and comfortable inside, a very friendly\
  \ and almost family like type of atmosphere. Just what I needed after an unexpected\
  \ first day that taught me to trust my own instincts. I can handle anything that\
  \ comes my way!"
