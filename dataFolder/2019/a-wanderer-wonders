Text: I got the travel bug when i travelled to Israel and Egypt and the West Bank.
  I then taught English in Beijing for 1 year. I travelled to 10 cities in China and
  know the language moderately well. I actually wrote a letter to, David Cameron,
  the British Prime Minister about how I think a society can improve an economy. I
  then travelled to teach English in Istanbul which I thoroughly enjoyed. When I travel
  I travel alone but am never alone which is the beauty of it. I have camped in the
  Saraha Desert in Morocco and in Wadi Rum in Jordan. I make friends with locals and
  foreigners making sure I immerse myself into the culture. As the Bible says at the
  start, 'go to different nations and make friends'. I have friends all over the world
  who I still speak to on Facebook. Istanbul was the capital of two empires and it
  is an amazing city. Additionally I have travelled in my own country to London, and
  Edinburgh. I want to go to Liverpool and Bristol amongst other cities. I am a keen
  walker. Two years ago I travelled to Paris and had a great time. I stay in hostels
  such as St Christopher's Inn who was the patron Saint on travellers moreover I have
  also stayed in Abraham hostels in Tel Aviv and Jerusalem, Abraham was a significant
  figure in Christianity, Islam, and Judaism. Rome was also special to see. My most
  memorable experience was seeing the whole of Petra by donkey in Jordan. Travel is
  certainly the best education. Most of my friends are from the travel app named couch
  surfing.
