Text: "\"I'm going to bring this lovely novel too!\" I said, with a truly optimistic\
  \ and spirit that I brought through my Bromo trip.\n\nI got into the bus and sat\
  \ on the bench with my Mom beside me. We didn't really talk too much at that time,\
  \ and I just enjoyed the view while we went to Magelang, where the Bromo Mountain\
  \ is located. It was so great to have time to just sat and relaxed while you enjoying\
  \ the view along the road. \nI also read the novel that I brought, which was the\
  \ latest book of Harry Potter, and then fell asleep because it was already night.\n\
  \nAround 2 am, we arrived at the location and started looking for the toilets, which\
  \ was really difficult to find. Besides, there were so many people who sell the\
  \ hiking essentials to the visitors, like jackets, scarfs, etcetera. That place\
  \ is literally crowded. There was also many buses and other transportation. With\
  \ a dark condition, it was so difficult to just walk and looking for someone else.\n\
  \nAs we waited for the Jeep to take us to the hiking area, we were just sitting\
  \ on the cold bench and eating some snacks, because it was morning and our stomach\
  \ was screaming, wanted to eat something. Well, what could we do, right?\n\nAnd\
  \ finally, the Jeep has arrived, picked us up and took us to the place where we\
  \ have to walk with a very cold temperature, probably around seven Celcius degree.\
  \ Well, I couldn't help it, so I decided to went to one of the places where I could\
  \ eat and warm myself. And a bowl of a noodle was literally a very good idea. After\
  \ I finished my business with my food, I started walking again.\n\nEven though there\
  \ were some pressures at first, included the very cold temperature that hit me,\
  \ the ending was totally worth it. At 4:30 am, the sun rose up and the panorama\
  \ got me shocked and amazed. It was so amazing! The sun looked like it just showed\
  \ up from the bottom, and the gradient was really wonderful, a kind of combination\
  \ between the orange, red, and yellow color. \n\nUnfortunately, I froze out and\
  \ finally forced myself to wear a pair of my gloves. Well, my plan of tried to be\
  \ cool with the cold has been failed. Whatever. I don\u2019t care about trying to\
  \ be cool anymore. It could kill me. Haha.\n\nAfter we finished enjoying the sunrise,\
  \ our tour guide brought us to the place that I\u2019ve been waiting for my entire\
  \ life, which is Pasir Berbisik or you can call it Whispering Sand! It\u2019s the\
  \ place that fills with the sand, like seriously, there was only limitless sand\
  \ that you could see. I\u2019ve been waiting to visit this place because there are\
  \ so many friends of mine who already showed their experience right here. And it\
  \ looked like, literally, fun!\n\nAfter that, our tour guide picked us up again,\
  \ and this time he brought us to the place where the crater of Bromo Mountain is\
  \ located. I wanted to go closer to the crater, but then my Mom stopped me because\
  \ she didn't want to accompany me to go there. Instead, I rode a horse with my friend\
  \ to the starting way of the crater. Then we went back, without going to the crater.\
  \ \n\nAnd there's one more place that I've been waiting for so long, again, which\
  \ is Bukit Teletubbies, or you can call it Teletubbies Hill! It was named after\
  \ the cartoon title because the place looks like exactly the same as Teletubbies'\
  \ home. Teletubbies Hill filled with the grass and so do Teletubbies.\n\nAnd that\
  \ is actually the last place on Bromo Mountain that I visited. I went back to the\
  \ place where the buses parked and the driver took me and the other to the hotel\
  \ to take a rest. Along the way to the hotel, I started thinking that I didn't expect\
  \ to find that kind of great memories from this latest trip.\nThat was such a memorable\
  \ trip to remember!"
