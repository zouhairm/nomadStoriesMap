Text: "Sun beamed through the window illuminating rays of yellow dust floating throughout\
  \ the cramped boutique. The air in the shop was unvented, making it thick like smoke,\
  \ and filling my lungs with the same heaviness my shoulders felt from backpack straps\
  \ weighing on them all day. A long wooden shelf that held jars of vibrantly coloured\
  \ spices only emphasized my sharp hunger pains; especially after failing to find\
  \ a restaurant for lunch along the narrow backroads of Fort Kochi. What I found\
  \ instead, was a savory smelling beauty boutique that made my mouth water and my\
  \ stomach groan.\n\nAs the front door creaked closed, I noticed how many mirrors\
  \ were placed around such a compact room. Although no two were the same shape, all\
  \ of them wore a layer of the same yellow chalk, as if they\u2019d been stored in\
  \ someone\u2019s attic. The chipped mirror in the foyer stared at me. In its reflection\
  \ I saw light green eyes looking back into mine, with pale hair and cheeks, rosy\
  \ from the heat. This face clearly didn\u2019t belong in the back alleys of Southern\
  \ India.\n\nThe woman who was working abandoned her counter at the back of the room\
  \ and approached me excitedly. As she walked toward me, her dark hair and purple\
  \ sari swayed with her strides. Her deep brown eyes were soft. They were met at\
  \ the corners by crow\u2019s feet; the kind you get from laughing too much. \n\n\
  A pang of self consciousness hit my ego after the mental comparison of how out of\
  \ place I looked. My fair skin was sunburnt. My backpack made my my t-shirt cling\
  \ to my body from muggy humidity. My blonde hair gathered in a ponytail pasted to\
  \ my neck.\n\nTo my surprise, she exclaimed, \"You are so beautiful!\" as she touched\
  \ my hair with her free hand. A chunk of raw turmeric occupied her other.\n\n\"\
  Your skin is so white! I wish I had skin so white.\" Her accent was thick and took\
  \ concentration for my English trained ears to understand, but her smile was impartial\
  \ to language barriers.\n\nShe explained to me that the turmeric on the shelves\
  \ and in her palm was to grind into powder to rub all over the face. She said it\
  \ was supposed to make a woman\u2019s skin lighter, removing dark spots, \u201C\
  to appeal more to men.\u201D \n\nThe meloncholy in her tone was familiar to me.\
  \ We women are always too dark. Too pale. Too blemished. Too anything except what\
  \ we ought to be to appeal more to men. The multi billion dollar beauty industry\
  \ in my Western world relies on it. I was surprised to learn now, that whatever\
  \ beauty industry existed in this modest fishing village on the shores of South\
  \ India-- in her world-- also relied on a woman\u2019s self-doubt.\n\nI confessed\
  \ that I thought she was the beautiful one. \"Where I come from, everybody wants\
  \ their skin to be darker, like you.\" A bubble of disbelieving laughter escaped\
  \ her grin as if I\u2019d just told her my best joke. \u201CIt\u2019s true!\u201D\
  \ I claimed. \u201CWe use makeup to make it look dark from the sun. We even pay\
  \ money to go into tanning beds, which actually burns our skin browner.\u201D She\
  \ bobbed her head from shoulder to shoulder, as if to dismissively say, \u201CYeah,\
  \ right.\u201D \n\nI started to weave the tight aisles of perfecting spices and\
  \ cure-all remedies. The narrow displays presented me with a glaring awareness that\
  \ my fair skin tone wasn\u2019t that of the target customer's. The labels informed\
  \ me that I didn\u2019t have the right kinds of flaws for these antidotes to fix;\
  \ however, in this moment, it didn't bother me.\n\nApproaching the end of the vibrantly\
  \ coloured spice jars, I arrived at the chipped mirror by the door of the hazy boutique\
  \ once more. Glancing up, I smiled at my own dusty reflection this time, noticing\
  \ soft eyes. They were met at the corners by crow\u2019s feet; the kind you get\
  \ from laughing too much."
