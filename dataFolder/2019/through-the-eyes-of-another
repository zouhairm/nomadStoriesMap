Text: "As I sit here contemplating what to write it gives me that wonderful feeling\
  \ of accomplishments already made.  I began my adventure into travel blogging about\
  \ six months ago and have not stopped since.  As a lover of traveling all over I\
  \ really had no idea that this could be something done for a living, and alas I\
  \ have finally found my niche not only for blogging, but also for life.\n\nAs the\
  \ theme goes \u2018a leap into the unknown\u2019 could be considered the story of\
  \ my life.  For now, however, I will just go with the most recent adventure as it\
  \ were.  \n\nAll adventures would be considered leaps overall.  Mine began by RV\u2019\
  ing across the US, a quick cruise to Alaska, A run to Washington DC, a jump to New\
  \ Orleans for All Hallows\u2019 Eve, and then finally ending up in Aruba.  Yes,\
  \ tis a bit of an off-course whirlwind, but an amazing \u2018leap\u2019 into what\
  \ is now my life.\n\nMy adventure into Aruba was definitely the largest leap I have\
  \ taken thus far.  An amazing trip outside of the USA, and well out of my comfort\
  \ zone.  I got to feel the true aspects of island life.  Beautiful beaches, warm\
  \ ocean currents, cultures I had never thought I would see.  Being able to travel\
  \ throughout the island via tram or bus, meeting and learning from the locals, and\
  \ using that knowledge to seak and learn all I could from this \u2018leap.\u2019\
  \n\nAs my travel blog niche will tell you I am utilizing these leaps as not only\
  \ the ability to help myself, but also all others that have what I call \u2018social\
  \ ambiguities\u2019 (be it PTSD, Bi-Polar, anxiety, empathic, etc.).  Sometimes\
  \ even the smallest momentum can inspire those who feel they cannot overcome such\
  \ obstacles.  \n\nAruba itself was just that, an ability to see if I could get over\
  \ my own \u2018social ambiguities\u2019 and travel throughout.  From snorkeling\
  \ in the warm waters of De Palm Island, to finding some amazing food and socializing\
  \ with many people, my eyes have been opened to a whole new world.  I can travel\
  \ freely to see all that there is to see and share my stories to all that wish to\
  \ read.  To expand horizons and help people see they can do anything, even if through\
  \ the eyes of another.\n\nThank you for considering me to join you on this journey.\
  \  This may not be exactly what you are looking for in travel stories, but I do\
  \ believe that all stories should come from not only experience, also from the heart.\
  \  Please take a look at my travel writing at tripperdaily.com.  It would be an\
  \ amazing opportunity to travel and share even more, especially as, Tripperdaily."
