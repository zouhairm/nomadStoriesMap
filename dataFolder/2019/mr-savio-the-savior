Text: "It was my second time in Goa \u2013 the city people wish to be in India for\
  \ a chill weekend with friends. The movie \u2013 \u201CDil Chahta Hai\u201D had\
  \ increased the craze for Goa trip among friends on weekend. For me, this being\
  \ the second time down the line; I was the guide to our group. It was me who decided\
  \ the itinerary and also took the decisions right from where to eat to where to\
  \ stay.\nIt was our first day in Goa and me being the only one who could drive a\
  \ two-wheeler among the bunch of 4 girls, we decided to rent a car. Our hotel receptionist\
  \ gave us number of 2-3 taxi drivers, out of which we decided to go with Mr. Savio\
  \ after finalizing on the rates and all. We covered all the beaches of North Goa\
  \ right from Sinquerim to Vagator Beach on the first day of our trip. Thanks to\
  \ Mr. Savio, he was a very kind man who took proper care of us and made us visit\
  \ all the spots on time.\nIt was our first night at Goa and as any other young ladies\
  \ group would have decided, we decided to enjoy the nightlife at Goa by visiting\
  \ the nightclub. The best nightclub in our locality was \"Caf\xE9 Mambos\" at Baga\
  \ Beach which was about 1.2 km from our hotel room. That being a walkable distance,\
  \ we decided to walk the lane and reach the club. The other 2 not being a party\
  \ freak decided to stay in the room and save energy for the next day\u2019s trip.\
  \ So, we both embarked onto our destination \u2013 Caf\xE9 Mambos. We reached the\
  \ destination and came to know that it was Ladies night so there was free alcohol\
  \ for all the ladies in the house. We started to have drinks and went to the dance\
  \ floor. The dance floor was chic with the most happening crowd of Goa. We let our\
  \ hairs loose. Soon my friend started to drink more and more and I tried to stop\
  \ her, but she seemed in control; until the time she puked. I thought now we need\
  \ to go out of the club and get back to the hotel as my friend was sloshed. My trouble\
  \ began when she was unable to walk properly, I carried her to the nearest restaurant\
  \ and made her drink some lemonade and sit there till I figure out how to reach\
  \ hotel. It was almost 3.30 am and I tried reaching out to the cab drivers outside\
  \ but none of them was ready to drop us to such a close distance. I called our hotel\
  \ hoping to get some help there but nobody picked up the call. Then I thought of\
  \ calling Mr. Savio. I was in a dilemma whether to disturb him at this hour of time\
  \ but due to the situation I just dialed his number and luckily, he picked up my\
  \ call. I asked him if he could come to pick us up from Tito\u2019s Lane back to\
  \ the hotel at this hour and he said yes \u2013 \u201CMa\u2019am wait for 15-20\
  \ minutes and I will be there at your location.\u201D Those words gave me great\
  \ relief and I waited for him patiently. After around 15 minutes, I received a call\
  \ from him that he was there. I brought my friend outside and found Mr. Savio waiting\
  \ outside patiently with a smile. He helped me with settling my friend in the car\
  \ and dropped us back to hotel without any questions. That day Mr. Savio was my\
  \ hero - the savior. People like Savio make us believe that kindness still exist\
  \ in Humans. Mr. Savio was the local connection I made during this trip and I would\
  \ remember him throughout my life and contact him whenever I am in Goa. Our trip\
  \ went very good for the rest of the days with Mr. Savio being there to guide us.\
  \ It was one of the best trips of my life with all my close people alongside me.\
  \ We made memories for life. Moments don\u2019t last long but the memories of those\
  \ moments last a lifetime."
