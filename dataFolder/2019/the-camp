Text: "A leap-the most affirming action one can ever take in life. I often hear people\
  \ say, \"you have to take that leap\" but what happens when you never can tell what\
  \ you're leaping into. \nI often ask myself did Nelson Mandela know what he was\
  \ getting himself into when he took that leap?  Was it his courage or the believe\
  \ in the fact that a journey of a thousand miles starts with a step or it can as\
  \ well start with a leap. \nI was getting ready to leave for the mandatory service\
  \ in my country after graduation. My heart was taking several leaps, it leaped for\
  \ joy and despair at the same time. I was beside myself with joy because I was going\
  \ to leave the house in search for greener pastures, I was going to see a new place\
  \ and meet new people  but at the same time I was beside myself with sadness. How\
  \ would I cope?  Would I be able to eat their kind if meal?  What type of people\
  \ would I meet?  These questions and more filled my heart but I was up for the adventure.\
  \ I was going to stay in the camp for three weeks with soldiers deployed to train\
  \ and keep us in check. \nI had heard different news about how terrifying the soldiers\
  \ could be, how people lost their lives during the process and how rigorous the\
  \ training was going to be. \nFinally, it was the day for me to travel to where\
  \ I had been posted. I was up as early as 4:30am, prepared, I couldn't eat because\
  \ I had no appetite. I took my already packed bag and my leave, kissed my family\
  \ goodbye and I headed to the car park. It was going to be a twelve hour journey\
  \ on the road. I stayed at the park longer than expected but I tried not to fly\
  \ off the handle after all it would do me no good if I'd lost my cool. \nThe bus\
  \ finally left the park and we were on our way. To me this was moving into the unknown\
  \ because I didn't know what awaited me r what to expect and the driver just helped\
  \ me take big leaps. The road came with traffic, military roadblocks, police check\
  \ points and all the fun things that made travelling by road pleasant.\nWe saw tall\
  \ buildings, passed through urban and rural areas, seeing mud houses at some point\
  \ and mansions at some point. This journey was going to be worthwhile I thought\
  \ to myself. \nAfter going on for hours we decided to stop to get something to eat\
  \ but I was so scared of having a runny stomach later so I just took white rice.\
  \ We started our journey after resting a bit. After hours of being on the road,\
  \ it was getting dark, talk about the unknown, our driver had lost track of our\
  \ destination so we had to utilize people as GPS to track our way. We finally got\
  \ to the camp and it was all in a military setting. Would my fears play out here?\
  \  Would everything I heard happen?  The adventure was worth it but I had arrived\
  \  at reality. What happens when you don't know what awaits you beyond those gates.\
  \ This leap into the unknown was not going to be an easy one."
