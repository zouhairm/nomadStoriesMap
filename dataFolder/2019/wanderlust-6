Text: "I've the thirst for adventure. I desire to see every corner of the Earth, and\
  \ then maybe see them all a few more times. It is the thought in the back of my\
  \ mind, as you drive home from school or to work one day, to take that turn you've\
  \ never taken and find out where it goes. It is the most raw and yet the most poetic\
  \ form of human curiosity. It drives me in a billion different directions and traces\
  \ the tracks that leave all over the world. I think I've a deep desire to explore\
  \ and enjoy the world. To me, it means desire to travel around the world seeing\
  \ new things, smelling new smells, and experiencing other peoples cultures. It is\
  \ a unique way that has consumed me. Because of the wanderlust pumping through my\
  \ veins, I know that I wanted to leave after graduation. I long for the opportunity\
  \ to go to to school in another state and live on my own. I want to explore, and\
  \ create my own adventures. I live to see Fiji, Thailand, and Greece. I dream about\
  \ swimming with the dolphins in Maldives, or going fishing in the Bahamas all while\
  \ giving thanks to the man above who created it all. Traveling the world will not\
  \ make me a better person and happiness will not arrive to stay as soon as we leave\
  \ home. If you feel empty anywhere, then that void cannot be filled somewhere else.\
  \ Peace within yourself will only happen if you decide to open up and help others\
  \ or change yourself first. Somebody once told me, \u201CHave you ever thought that\
  \ you\u2019re just looking for an escape?\u201D And maybe I am. After all, there\
  \ is a world inside of us and perhaps we should explore that one first before going\
  \ out to see the real one. But wanderlust is what I believe in; adventure is in\
  \ my bones and somewhere out there. I hope that one day I can roam about a new place\
  \ to feel tiny and insignificant all over again. There are more mountains to climb,\
  \ people to meet, and a wondrous Earth that I call \u201Chome\u201D. Traveling abroad\
  \ changes people\u2019s perspective. We cannot simply grasp how immense the world\
  \ is, let alone the universe, until we are somewhere alone foreign to our existence.\
  \ Nothing can replace the unique feeling of being somewhere that makes you feel\
  \ tiny and insignificant in the best way possible. I don't know where exactly the\
  \ wanderlust will drive me, but someday it will. It will be blissful. I wait impatiently\
  \ for it."
