Text: "First time doing volunteering abroad as a english teacher in one of local school\
  \ located in Kamareddy 160 km from Hyderabad city, India\n\nPeople are really nice,\
  \ keep smiling\n\nEven most of them, they don't know English but they keep trying\
  \ to communicate with you\n\nLooking for a toilet? Yea! Body language starts...\
  \ going to local market, took a Bajaj for looking around the village, go to local\
  \ shop and try local dishes!!\n\nLove their outfits like Sari; most of women wearing\
  \ it and when you notice about them, they will look back at you and smile.\n\nCow\
  \ represent God in India, they are a lot of cows in the road. When we are on the\
  \ car and see them wanna cross the road. We must stop and pay respect for them :)\n\
  \nSmile is the only way to connect each others. They are nice and keep smiling..\
  \ even in the motorcycle, they will keep looking at you and wave their hands.. this\
  \ kind of how people connect each others.\n\nEven my children in the school, they\
  \ are mostly very kind and representing pure heart and smile.\n\nNot all happiness\
  \ in the world shaped by money, they are still enjoying their life even when they\
  \ have nothing.\n\nLanguage is one of the way to connect each others but not the\
  \ one and only way. Even you understand the language but you don't know their culture\
  \ then problems come..\n\nThrough volunteering then you will find sharing what you\
  \ have and getting know new knowledge is the most effective ways to improve what\
  \ you have. \n\nSharing and getting to know each others, smile and feel the connection.\
  \ Heart connect each others.\n\nNothing in this world is eternal. As long as you\
  \ have beautiful soul then it will keep till last.\n\nWherever you go. enjoy it.\
  \ Feel the happiness through travel, remember that people in the world connect each\
  \ others by their heart and minds.\n\nDo what you love like nobody is watching.\
  \ Feel the freedom! \n\nLast but not least, enjoy your life. Connect your heart\
  \ with people and try to enjoy it! No one will reject you, and you will find the\
  \ best way to communicate.\n\nWrite down anything you found, share it with people,\
  \ its not to show how rich you are but share it just for improving your self. This\
  \ is called self love and you know how to feel thankful as well."
