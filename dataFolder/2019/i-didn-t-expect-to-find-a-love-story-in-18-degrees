Text: "I didn\u2019t expect to find how to live a better life, happiness & a love\
  \ story at 12,500 feet in -18 degrees where only 50 families lived and struggled\
  \ every day to survive.\n\n \n\nIt was still dawn when I started driving from Rampur,\
  \ a small village in Himachal. We were a group of 3 friends meeting after 2 years\
  \ taking this almost impossible trip of dangerously beautiful, \u2018Spiti valley\u2019\
  \ in February when the temperature is -18 degrees and there is snow-covered roads,\
  \ frozen waterfall, frozen lakes, magical mountains and snow leopard in the entire\
  \ vicinity. We moved only for 6 miles towards Kaza and we were still enjoying our\
  \ road trip when we got the news that there was an avalanche 2 miles away from where\
  \ we were. Rahul looked scared and I asked him, \u2018Should we go ahead\u2019?\n\
  \nHe replied very firmly,\u2019 You never know when will we come back here again,\
  \ when we will all be together again, let\u2019s do this\u2019. And as we reached\
  \ that avalanche the narrow roads were jammed and I decided to get out of our car\
  \ and have a closer look at it. I saw a 15-year-old local girl, Tenzen. She was\
  \ climbing that avalanche to take a slide from the top to down and when she came\
  \ down, she smiled, she smiled like she is in heaven and she loved it. I decided\
  \ to go at the top and take that slide which everyone wanted to take and I reached\
  \ the top, it was freezing cold, I was scared but I decide, I had to do it. I had\
  \ never been that happy. It was a feeling which was not normal, it was a feeling\
  \ which one must feel in their life and I smiled like I never smiled before in the\
  \ past 2 years. I didn\u2019t expect to find out the solution to of all the major\
  \ problems, perspective. It\u2019s all about perspective, Tenzen\u2019s perspective\
  \ was bigger than mine & I learn about thinking big.\n\n \n\nWe reached Kaza & saw\
  \ people greeting us in the most amazing way possible and loving our presence. We\
  \ got stuck in snow and 4 people who were going home after work without any thought\
  \ stayed there and helped us until the car was out and I realised why they were\
  \ so selfless? They had no competition with us, they genuinely wanted to help us\
  \ without any selfish motive. Happiness was their priority and they resonated it.\
  \ They smiled & waved us goodbye. I didn\u2019t expect to get happiness from our\
  \ getting stuck.\n\n \n\nPrachi suggested we should stay with the locals and not\
  \ staying at a hotel and we stayed at \u2018Santosh Home stay\u2019. Santosh aunty\
  \ was somewhere in her 40\u2019s and we had the best days of lives there, from waking\
  \ up to the famous sea buck thorn tea to the heavy dinner of \u2018Rajma- Chawal\u2019\
  \ (a local dish), it was perfect. Being an author, I always keep looking for stories\
  \ & I asked her about her daily schedule? Sonam was her husband &  he was a teacher\
  \ and he treks 3 mountains to meet her every weekend while Santosh aunty take classes\
  \ of local women at home & she makes them aware about women\u2019s body and how\
  \ they can take good care of themselves. I got excited about them and then she told\
  \ me how they had a love marriage in 1998 and they knew each other from childhood.\
  \ And I kept on thinking how at the rest of  India, everyone is sceptical about\
  \ caste & religion, while this small village of 100 people are so progressive that\
  \ they support love marriages and the entire villages comes together & collect funds\
  \ for one marriage.\n\nI didn\u2019t expect to learn so much in -18 degrees where\
  \ people can hardly survive. I realised how much of humans they were and how much\
  \ of humans we are busy in doing a job we don\u2019t want to, competing with each\
  \ other, not liking each other. I didn\u2019t expect to find how to live at a place\
  \ where only 100 people lived."
