Text: "Japan is an assault on the senses- in the best way possible. Every street commands\
  \ your attention, every stranger draws out a warmth inherent to you. Perhaps part\
  \ of its charm is the strangeness of it all, and the conviction you get, sitting\
  \ on the side of a street, that everyone is their true-selves here \u2013 that you,\
  \ by association, have the freedom to exhale and expand into yourself, too. \n\n\
  It wasn\u2019t the quirkiness of the people, or the mystery of its cleanliness despite\
  \ the absence of bins that captured my heart this time round (my third visit), however,\
  \ but the disarming kindness of strangers on the street who stopped to give us directions\
  \ when they noticed how lost we looked, or who simply smiled on the train when our\
  \ eyes met. \n\nAnd nowhere was this more unprecedented than at the Happiest Place\
  \ on Earth \u2013 Disneyland. The mere knowledge that a business model existed with\
  \ the objective of making people happy was enough to leave me \u2018triggered\u2019\
  , and seeing the wonder in kids and adults\u2019 eyes was a testimony to the success\
  \ of Walt Disney\u2019s dream. \n\nDisneyland was one of the first places we booked,\
  \ and definitely the most anticipated. From the moment we set foot in the JR and\
  \ glimpsed the castle, to being held up at the gate because we hadn\u2019t printed\
  \ out our tickets \u2013 only to have the staff rush to print them out for us, all\
  \ the while thanking us in broken English for coming all this way \u2013 to the\
  \ welcome and applause we received every time the staff saw our first-time-visitor\
  \ stickers, we were greeted with the most magical and infectious warmth. \n\nWe\
  \ had experienced this respect and care since the beginning of our trip, but the\
  \ memory of this particular moment is something that puts sunshine in my bones,\
  \ and leaves me with its lingering warmth, forever. Lost and somewhat overwhelmed,\
  \ the three of us approached a staff member to ask for a map of the site, and were\
  \ offered instead, generosity beyond what we could literally comprehend. On registering\
  \ our first-time-visitor stickers (pro-tip for anyone going to Tokyo Disneyland\
  \ for the first time, this bad boy will get you anywhere), this member of staff\
  \ turned to his colleagues and together, started searching through a pile of brochures,\
  \ finally producing for us an illegible piece of paper with the date on it, and\
  \ a time. Somewhat perplexed, we took it, politely smiling and requested again the\
  \ map. After a back-and-forth exchange which lasted for longer than what any patient\
  \ party could endure, we slowly came to the understanding that what this man who\
  \ we could barely understand was giving us were free tickets to the 35th Anniversary\
  \ of Disney Light Show in front of the castle that night. The unexpectedness of\
  \ this man\u2019s kindness, despite the inconvenience it cost him to explain for\
  \ 10 minutes what undeserving grace looks like to three unassuming Aussie girls,\
  \ was what pushed me over the edge, and nothing I could do could hide the overflow\
  \ of tears that were now dripping from beneath my sunglasses. \n\n It\u2019s moments\
  \ like those, wrapped up in the most mundane moments in your itinerary, that are\
  \ the most special and which remind you that kindness needs no translation. The\
  \ gentleness in that man\u2019s eyes said it all \u2013 generosity is a universal\
  \ language."
