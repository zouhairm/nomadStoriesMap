Text: "Not many Tuesdays begin with rare landforms and end with human bones.\n\nMy\
  \ partner and I had planned this trek to the \"tingy rouge\" for days. We left Diego\
  \ Suarez very early, around 6am, in order to beat the harshness of the inevitable\
  \ sun. We arrive at a crater filled with towering, impossible looking spires of\
  \ sand and clay.\_ At one time this was all under water, and now the cliffs have\
  \ eroded away in jagged points to leave a Mars-scape found nowhere else on earth\
  \ (but probably plentiful on other planets).\_ It looks like a place where a film\
  \ director might choose to shoot the next \u201CStar Wars\u201D movie, and as we\
  \ clamber around I half expect to see an Ewok poke it's fuzzy head around one of\
  \ the pillars. No Ewoks this time, but plenty of Ring-tailed Lemurs, hopping hot-footed\
  \ from spire to spire on the already sun-warmed rusty clay. \n\nNot bad for 9am\
  \ on a Tuesday, we thought, successful adventure complete. Little did we know, the\
  \ adventure was just beginning. \n\nBack in our little yellow taxi with our guide\
  \ Roger, we drive terrifyingly fast over giant holes along non-existent \u201Croads\u201D\
  \ through the woods.\_ At some points, we have to both sit on one side of the car\
  \ to make sure there is enough weight to keep it from falling over on a steep sideways\
  \ incline.\n\nSomehow, we make it to Ankarana in one piece and in only 2 hours.\_\
  \ As we eat lunch at our hotel, the owners insist that we go out on one more afternoon\
  \ hike.\_ Though tired, we can never decline a hike, and we happily agree.  \n\n\
  Within an hour, we are at our next hiking route. Our guide, Francisco, is a young\
  \ man whose lanky limbs are electric with energy as he bounds along the path to\
  \ the park.\_ On our way, we see two snakes mating on the side of the road, twisted\
  \ around each other in a tangled, rippling dance and waving their bodies through\
  \ the air.\_ We watch mesmerized for many minutes before continuing on: Francisco\
  \ tells us we want to get to \u201Cthe caves\u201D before it gets dark.\n\nCaves?\
  \ We thought we were going hiking to see more tsingy\u2026 \n\nThe caves are huge,\
  \ meandering labaryths that we can feel before we get there: the soft pet-store\
  \ alfalfa smell of bat guano, the cold breath of an underground breeze.\_ We climb\
  \ up to the entrance of the first cave and stand in the dim half-light of the mouth,\
  \ the sound of millions of bats echoing around the chamber.\_ At our feet near the\
  \ entrance is a pile of what is clearly bones\u2026 I bend down to look closer and\
  \ am struck by how very\u2026\_human\_they look.\_ Is that a skull?\n\n\u201CHuman\
  \ bones!\u201D Francisco announces delightedly.\_ We are flabbergasted but he goes\
  \ on to explain that in the 1600s, a Merina king from Antananarivo held the people\
  \ of Ankarana under siege, and hundreds of them hid in these caves, unable to go\
  \ outside without being killed.\_ We continue through the wandering labarynth of\
  \ the cave, shutting our lights off at one point in order to see (or not see) what\
  \ it must have been like for the hundreds of people hiding here before the invention\
  \ of lights.\_ Many people died in the caves, and we see more bones scattered about\
  \ as we continue to explore.\_ Anywhere else I would guess that the bones were left\
  \ for show, strategically placed so that visitors might happen upon them and have\
  \ an \u201Cauthentic\u201D experience.\_ But here, in Madagascar, I know those bones\
  \ are sitting there from a mixture of respect for the ancestors,\_fady\_(taboo),\
  \ and laziness, untouched for these many centuries.\n\nFurther along the cave we\
  \ shine our lights on huge semi-formed stalagmites, their white surfaces rippled\
  \ like glittering coral.\_ And on the ceilings we see millions of bats: in some\
  \ areas of the cave the ceiling is literally covered with the furry little bodies,\
  \ wriggling and muttering angrily at the disturbance of our lights.\n\nFor an adventure\
  \ we had no idea we were going to have, this may be one of the best of them."
