Text: "The Ugandan hospital isn\u2019t nearly as crowded today as it usually is. Or\
  \ so someone says. It still seems congested to me. It\u2019s hot. I feel confined\
  \ and think I might faint. I plunge my head between my knees and stare at the African\
  \ dirt that clings to my toes. The red clay doesn\u2019t come off easily, and I\
  \ don\u2019t want it to. I want Africa to stay with me.\n\nWhen I lift my head,\
  \ I see them: women, everywhere. They\u2019re on the floor, multicoloured mats beneath\
  \ them. Their hands are wrapped around their large bellies, fingers splayed, as\
  \ if that will prod the baby along faster. They moan, and I watch their faces twist.\
  \ There are no beds for them. Not yet. Not until they\u2019re moments away from\
  \ delivering \u2014 and even then some give birth in the hallway.\n \nNow I see.\
  \ It\u2019s not just red dirt on the ground; it\u2019s blood. \n \nDr. Eve Nakabembe\
  \ meets me amidst the tangle of women on the floor. She\u2019s a senior gynecologist.\
  \ It\u2019s supposed to be her day off, but she needs to scrub in \u2014 a woman\
  \ is bleeding out from a ruptured uterus. She\u2019ll call when she\u2019s finished\
  \ surgery.\n \n\u201CPray for me.\u201D Dr. Eve\u2019s words hang in the thick air.\
  \ \u201CI only have three of the ten instruments I need.\u201D \n \nBefore I can\
  \ respond, she walks away.\n \nDr. Eve phones three hours later. Surgery is over.\
  \ She smiles when she sees me, but it doesn\u2019t quite reach her eyes. She\u2019\
  s tired. She thanks me again for coming, and I follow her into a room. \n \nWe slip\
  \ off our shoes. A woman is in a hospital bed, asleep. A man and older woman \u2014\
  \ her husband and mother, I think \u2014 stand at the foot of the bed, like sentinels.\
  \ \n \n\u201CThis is Judith,\u201D Dr. Eve tells me. She looks at Judith\u2019s\
  \ family. \u201CI\u2019m sorry,\u201D she says, \u201Cbut the baby has died. It\u2019\
  s a miracle Judith is alive.\u201D \n \nSuddenly I am crying. The woman on the bed\
  \ was pregnant for nine months \u2014 and all she will find when she wakes up are\
  \ fresh scars and empty arms. Judith cannot cry yet, so I cry for her. \n \nWe leave\
  \ Judith\u2019s room. As we step over women in a dirty hallway, Dr. Eve says she\
  \ hasn\u2019t drunk any water since morning. There are too many women to see, too\
  \ many babies to try and save. \n \n\u201CI have learned I am never finished,\u201D\
  \ she says. Later, Dr. Eve will tell me she studied medicine in Switzerland. She\u2019\
  ll tell me how she knew she couldn\u2019t stay. Uganda called to her, wooing her\
  \ back home. \u201CEvery day I go home and think, \u2018Maybe if I had stayed for\
  \ thirty more minutes, one more life could have been saved.\u2019\u201D\n \nShe\
  \ takes me to a room with mothers who have just delivered. I follow behind Dr. Eve,\
  \ who heads toward a woman and her baby in the center of the room. She talks to\
  \ the mother quietly. I stare at the baby lying on the bed. She\u2019s one day old.\
  \ \n\nDr. Eve looks at me. She sees me staring, then picks up the baby and places\
  \ her in my arms. \n\n\u201COh,\u201D I say. I stare down at her. \u201CHi baby\
  \ girl.\u201D I haven\u2019t held a baby this young or small before. I think of\
  \ Judith a few rooms over. This could\u2019ve been her. \n\n\u201CThe mother wants\
  \ you to name her baby,\u201D Dr. Eve says.\n \nMy head whips. \u201CMe?\u201D\n\
  \ \nShe laughs. \u201CThat\u2019s right. She\u2019d like you to name the baby.\u201D\
  \n \nI stutter. \u201CIs she sure? She just did all that work. I can\u2019t name\
  \ her baby.\u201D \n \nDr. Eve smiles. She\u2019s soft, but firm. \u201CTrust me,\u201D\
  \ she says. \u201CIt would mean a lot to her.\u201D \n \nI stare at the baby girl;\
  \ her dark, downy hair soft against her forehead. I think of naming her Olivia after\
  \ my sister, but it\u2019s not African and I want to honour the country I\u2019\
  ve come to love. I turn to the woman beside me: a woman who dedicates her life to\
  \ saving mothers, a woman who loves both God and people, and suddenly I know.\n\
  \ \nI look back at the baby girl. A girl who is now named Eve."
