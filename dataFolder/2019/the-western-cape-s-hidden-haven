Text: "Standing on the edge of the stoep the clear blue lagoon stretched out before\
  \ my eyes and soft white sand beaches called from below. Not a soul in sight. Everyone\
  \ still tucked away in their beds which was not surprising as it was before 7 am.\
  \ My family and I were renting a classic Cape Dutch house in the picturesque Chruchhaven,\
  \ a small settlement within the West Coast National Park - a haven for nature. \n\
  \nI closed my eyes, listening. The rustling of the leaves in the wind, the caw of\
  \ the francolins, the waves crashing on the rocks and the hum of a motorboat in\
  \ the distance began to paint a picture of the morning ahead. Taking a deep breath\
  \ I noted that there were no odours of diesel soaked cities where the air lingers\
  \ with the smell of tobacco and sweat.  Instead, I found only fresh air that carried\
  \ the unmistakable taste of the sea and the promise of a few lazy hours on the beach.\n\
  \ \nStretching into the moment of a landscape almost completely unpolluted by human\
  \ intervention I felt the dull ache of yesterday\u2019s activities. An almost nine-kilometre\
  \ walk along a winding tortoise-strewn road, where the odd buck could be spotted\
  \ by those with keen eyes and a curiosity for wildlife, leads to Kraalbaai beach\
  \ \u2013 a heavenly stretch of soft sand and cerulean water that rivals even the\
  \ most pristine Mediterranean beaches. You could spend hours floating on the surface,\
  \ letting the sun wash over your skin through the clouds before emerging ravenous\
  \ for a wholesome and hearty picnic lunch. A quiet afternoon filled with siestas,\
  \ books and early evening wine brought the day to a close. \n\nI didn\u2019t expect\
  \ to find this wonderfully serene place where nature and time seemed to stand still.\
  \ Where a tapestry of shining stars undiluted by street lights, and the allure of\
  \ animals uninhibited by civilisation makes leaving almost impossible. Brave fish\
  \ swim by and brush the legs of eager swimmers. Tiny field mice search for scraps\
  \ under the dinner table, careful not to disturb any guests with their presence.\
  \ I found with that I did not miss the call of the city, it doesn\u2019t have gemsbok\
  \ grazing outside windows in the early hours before the sun has even begun to light\
  \ up the day."
