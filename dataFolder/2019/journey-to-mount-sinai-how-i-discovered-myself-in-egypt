Text: "You know the place, because it is biblical. But, you don\u2019t expect what\
  \ I will tell you, I didn\u2019t either. When I arrived in Egypt, I was just thinking\
  \ about pyramids and mummies. And right away I knew I was wrong.\nIt feels so good\
  \ to be wrong. In that place, a 21 years old Brazilian girl would live the best\
  \ moment of her life. Egypt was so different of everything I knew. I was in another\
  \ country with an unknown culture, language, gastronomy and religion. But this is\
  \ the beauty of travel, right?\nIn the first weeks I thought I was just learning\
  \ about other people. But I was wrong again. I wasn\u2019t just learning about them,\
  \ I was discovering myself! I know, it is a little cliche. But, I had to live a\
  \ lot until I understood that.\nClimbing the mountain\nOne of the trips I made in\
  \ Cleopatra\u2019s country was climbing Mount Sinai. I wasn\u2019t expecting too\
  \ much about it, but I went to meet the place that Moses and Abraham made history.\
  \ So, me and my friends rented a bus to go from Cairo to Sinai.\nOn a cold Thursday\
  \ night, I arrived in the base of a huge mountain. There, I put a lot of layers\
  \ of clothing and a light in my forehead. And that was it, I started walking through\
  \ the place that would change me forever.\nAt the first hour, I was feeling really\
  \ bad. I started to panic because I couldn\u2019t breathe. When I thought I would\
  \ have to give up, a little Egyptian named Abdu went close to me and said: \u201C\
  You have to give life to all your bad memories\u201D.\nThat moment, I knew what\
  \ I had to do. I thought about every pain, every broken heart and I cried a lot.\
  \ But, I learned to transform my pain into success. Everything I remembered was\
  \ like a push to reach me to the top of the mountain. And I climbed it and saw the\
  \ most beautiful sunrise ever. In that moment, I never felt so alive!\nSo, thank\
  \ you Egypt for transforms me in my best version of myself. To give me the opportunity\
  \ to know who I am and to make me a citizen of the world. \nI can\u2019t wait to\
  \ share more with you!\t\nUntil next time,\nMariana"
