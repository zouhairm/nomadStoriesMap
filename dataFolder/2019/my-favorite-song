Text: "It was my most spontaneous journey.\nAt 1 o'clock in the morning I realized\
  \ that I couldn\u2019t just not go anywhere for Christmas. At 5 in the morning I\
  \ left the house.\nAn hour later it turned out that I was late for the bus, and\
  \ there was no suitable blah blah car. I was standing at the bus stop with a backpack\
  \ and did not know what to do. Go home? Finish the journey so it is not starting?\n\
  Never! I will go to Tallinn anyway.\nI drove to the nearest highway and started\
  \ the good old hitchhiking. So began my first hitchhiking to another country.\n\
  Although Estonia is a country where hitchhiking is not very popular, I still stood\
  \ on the highway a little. Always found good people who tried to help me. The last\
  \ was an Estonian who talked about his grandmother. She constantly treats him with\
  \ pies and worries about whether everything is good with his grandson. At that moment\
  \ I realized that all the grandmothers of the world are the same.\n\nI went out\
  \ in the center of Tallinn. People were walking around, and I had a feeling that\
  \ I had just teleported to this city right from my bed. It was as if these 6 hours\
  \ of hitchhiking were not, and all the drivers I just had a dream about. I had no\
  \ city map, no internet, no guide. In my hand was a phone with 15 percent charge.\
  \ But I was not sad. I just stood in the center of Tallinn and enjoyed the views\
  \ of the old city ...\n\nWherever I went, good people everywhere came across to\
  \ me: tourists from Colombia took pictures of me on their phone and sent me a photo\
  \ of whatsapp, a married couple explained where to go, and a local guy just treated\
  \ me to pizza. Wandering alone in the old town, I suddenly stumbled upon a beautiful\
  \ old church. Go inside? Of course yes!\n\nI was incredibly lucky - the Christmas\
  \ concert was just beginning at the church. Near the entrance lay brochures with\
  \ lyrics and prayers. The prayers were in Estonian and Russian. At some point, they\
  \ started singing these prayers in Estonian. Without knowledge of the language,\
  \ it was difficult for me to read it, but I sincerely tried to sing with them. And\
  \ suddenly a miracle happened. They continued to sing it, but in Russian. The peoples\
  \ who lived for so long together, and then lived apart, sang in the church in one\
  \ burst of soul in the same language. Estonian grandfathers tried to sing in Russian,\
  \ and the Russians in Estonian ... After the concert, people left the church and\
  \ congratulated each other, Russians and Estonians ... Only then did I understand\
  \ how warm this holiday was. Christmas ... It unites nations.\nWhile politics spoils\
  \ friendship, Christmas again makes us human ...\nWhen there was an hour home before\
  \ my bus, I returned to the old city to say goodbye to him. The city is like a man,\
  \ he is alive and he has a soul ... Goodbye the city, thank you, and I'll be back.\
  \ You gave me faith in people and good back.\nIt was a very beautiful evening.\n\
  Then I heard the Russian language. It was street musicians talking. I asked them\
  \ how to get to the train station, but in fact it was just an excuse for dating.\
  \ Two young guys with a guitar. They were terribly overjoyed to learn that I was\
  \ from Russia, and asked what I should sing goodbye.\n\nChristmas lights were burning\
  \ outside, beautiful guitar sounds were heard, a song sounded.\nIt was my favorite\
  \ song."
