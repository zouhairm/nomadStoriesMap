Text: "Tired of waiting for a company to travel, I decided to make my first trip all\
  \ by myself. The destiny: Thailand. I bought the flight ticket on sale. Then I spent\
  \ months planning all the details and reading about the country.\nWhen the big day\
  \ came, I had butterflies in my stomach, but I took a deep breathe and left for\
  \ my  adventure. After all, I had planned the trip for a long time, there was nothing\
  \ to fear.\nI started my journey in Bangkok. A city with many contrasts, between\
  \ Buddhist temples, chaotic traffic, modern buildings and intense heat.\nI explored\
  \ the beautiful temples of the city, visited Ayutthaya ruins, walked in the crazy\
  \ Khao San Road, drank the most expensive drink of my life in Sirocco Sky Bar (from\
  \ the movie \u201CThe Hangover\u201D), tasted the local food, made new friends and\
  \ learned about Thai culture.\nI continued my way in north of Thailand, knowing\
  \ more temples in Chiang Mai and Chiang Rai. There I was able to learn more about\
  \ Thai devotion to Buddhism, the meaning of their offerings and understand the importance\
  \ of these traditions.\nI also visited Karen Long Neck Village (the giraffe women),\
  \ a place that left me a divided feeling about be helping or not those people with\
  \ my visit. They live on the money raised from the sale of their handicrafts. But,\
  \ in a way, they are exploited by Thai government, which charge for access to the\
  \ tribe and keeps the money for itself.\nAfter meeting the Buddhist culture, the\
  \ most expected part of the trip arrived: Thai beaches. I went on to Railay Beach.\
  \ I had just arrived by boat and I was already impressed by the scenery.\nBoat trips,\
  \ more tipical food, a food poisoning in the middle of my way (I survived rsrs),\
  \ late afternoons with amazing sunsets. I was never tired of sitting and contemplating\
  \ that paradisiacal landscape and think: \u201CI am in Thailand, I did it\u201D\
  .\nMy last stop in the country was the famous Phi Phi Islands archipelago. What\
  \ a beautiful place. There I had more two adventures with big importance to me.\n\
  First was to do Sleep Aboard Maya Bay tour. Was amazing to meet that beautiful beach\
  \ and spend the night on a boat. Watching the sunset and sleeping under the starry\
  \ sky was worth the whole trip.\nMy second adventure was to dive in the Island.\
  \ I don\u2019t know how to swin, but new Brazilian friends that I had met during\
  \ the trip convinced me diving with them. I confess that when I jumped in the water\
  \ with the dive equipment I was in panic. But the instructor calmed me down and\
  \ in the end it was a beautiful experience to know the bottom of the sea.\nIn my\
  \ last day I stayed on the beach contemplating that beauty, to keep all that in\
  \ my memory.\nI just can say this was the best experience of my life. Opened my\
  \ eyes for the best company I can have in a trip: myself.  Of course to travel with\
  \ friends is good. But to have a time alone, in a new and diferent place, allows\
  \ to know yourself, make everything in your time, when and where you want, and teachs\
  \ you to overcome your fears. It was worth every second, and if I can give some\
  \ advise to someone I will say: Travel alone at least once in your life!"
