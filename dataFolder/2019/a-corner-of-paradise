Text: "Just half an hour away from the bustling town Benidorm, in Spain,  a small\
  \ piece of paradise awaits those who seek the most natural adventure. \n\nThe mountains\
  \ stand tall whilst an abundance of luscious waterfalls from the Fonts de l\u2019\
  Algar, cascade from the peak. \n\nA hot summers day will call for a dive from one\
  \ of the many rocks and pebble pools below. \n\nThe water feels so pure and fresh,\
  \ the initial splash will reawaken your senses and remind you of your inner primal\
  \ warrior, whilst you can repower your soul beneath the force of the flowing water.\
  \ \n\nAfter a day of splashing about, you will feel so refreshed and alive. \n\n\
  The three cafes on site all have great food and refreshments and they offer a Gelato\
  \ ice cream bar to satisfy your sweet tooth on a hot day. \n\nThe mixture of fresh\
  \ blue water and tropical foliage  adorn the outside of the pools and it is not\
  \ uncommon for the locals to collect their water at the top of the waterfall in\
  \ bottles. \n\nThe rocks are monitored  by lifeguards so you can be sure that there\
  \ is help on hand should you need it, but you must use your own common sense when\
  \ jumping, being careful not bash into any of the lurking rocks below. The divers\
  \ are all very competent at showing you the best places, if in doubt, let someone\
  \ jump before you, don\u2019t miss out because of fear of the cold, it\u2019s perfectly\
  \ safe and is a dive in a lifetime. \n\n\nAt the entrance sits a cavern with the\
  \ bottom of the cascade, through it is still very powerful and continues to trickle\
  \ all down the mountain and into the surrounding towns, but it does get chilly in\
  \ there as the sun doesnt poke through the cave much throughout the day. \n\n At\
  \ the top of the mountain is the treetop walk, and this will take you out to the\
  \ view of the mountains and the habitats around, taking in the air at such altitude\
  \ feels so invigorating and a sense of freedom is overwhelingly powerful as the\
  \ air is so open with a breathtakingly beautiful view. \n\n\nThe shops offer pots\
  \ of honey from the region, my favourite being the honey made with lemon flower\
  \ blossom, and many delights to take home as a souvenir. \n\nThe best souvenir though,\
  \ is the experience and the memory  that if just  for a few hours, you\u2019ve reached\
  \ a corner of paradise."
