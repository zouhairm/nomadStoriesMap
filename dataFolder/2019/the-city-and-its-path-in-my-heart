Text: "When being on a school trip to Barcelona, I had never thought that I would\
  \ have had such a strong connection to the city like I did. Everyday I look back\
  \ to when I was younger and in a new part of the world and I am grateful to have\
  \ had the opportunity that I did. I was exploring the city with a few of my friends\
  \ when we got lost, we were on a major street but did not know which way to go in\
  \ order for us get back to the meeting spot where our teachers were waiting for\
  \ us. Being teenagers and being lost in a city where not a lot of people spoke English\
  \ was scary. It was dawning on us that if we didn't get back that we would get into\
  \ a lot of trouble, so we walked to the beach and decided to start from there and\
  \ try and work our way back to the meeting spot. We were rushing because if we would\
  \ get there late then everyone would have to wait for us. When we got to the beach\
  \ we tried to look for a store or anything that was familiar to us. That was when\
  \ my mind started to remember the way back, the streets looked familiar so I guided\
  \ my friends through the streets and found ourselves back to the meeting spot. My\
  \ mind had fallen in love with the city, that it was exactly why it knew how to\
  \ get back. To this day, I can remember the streets, what they looked like and see\
  \ the older man playing guitar on the steps of the door to a caf\xE9. The city brings\
  \ back warm memories and I will never forget the connection that I made to Barcelona\
  \ and it making such an impact on me. I have not been able to go back, yet I look\
  \ at the photos that I have and remember every moment."
