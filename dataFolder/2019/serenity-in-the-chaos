Text: "I saw thousands of people buzzing around like ants in sugar, my ears were filled\
  \ with the piercing sound of horns being tooted in every direction. My eyes were\
  \ blasted with the contrast of beautiful bright colours of saris, painted buildings\
  \ and spices filling the streets. \n\nTo say the least my first moments of India\
  \ were a culture shock. I felt overwhelmed by all of the sights, smells and noises\
  \ surrounding my consciousness, however the more time I spent in this interesting\
  \ land the more I enjoyed it and embraced the differences about it. I loved the\
  \ adventure and spontaneity of it all, I loved the fact that every moment I would\
  \ see something new. \n\nOne of the main things that I loved about India was the\
  \ people, I admired the fact that even though people were struggling In their own\
  \ lives, they would still make an effort to be kind to me. The local people welcomed\
  \ me with open arms in to their country and homes. An example of this was when a\
  \ large family of 12 living in a tiny run down house asked me to come to their home\
  \ as they gave me a plate full of delicious biscuits and crackers, my heart was\
  \ filled with admiration with their generosity. \n\nThe people of India also demonstrated\
  \ a great example of no matter how chaotic the outside world is, if you can be at\
  \ a state of calm and feel balanced within, then you can go anywhere in the world\
  \ without allowing the outer world to overwhelm you,  therefore you are free to\
  \ live life without fear taking control. The way that they demonstrate this is with\
  \ their yoga and meditation practices, the country has a huge focus on these spiritual\
  \ activities and it shows in the way the people are often content, happy and grateful\
  \ even when they are in financial or survival hardship, because they have these\
  \ tools to focus inward. \n\nAnother highlight of this adventure  was the effort\
  \ that the locals put in to making India a beautiful place. They paint their houses\
  \ with the most beautiful mix of bright colors and patterns, the women wear eye\
  \ catching saris and dresses that radiate vibrant shades of warm reds, oranges,\
  \ yellows, or refreshing  blues, purples and greens. Not only that but they also\
  \ decorate their trucks with fresh flowers and painted murals. \n\nIn conclusion\
  \ going to India was the most amazing, beautiful and eye opening experience of my\
  \ life. It taught me the lessons of kindness and welcoming, it blew me away with\
  \ how beautiful, crazy and wonderful of a place it is to visit. But most of all\
  \ in taught me serenity within the chaos."
