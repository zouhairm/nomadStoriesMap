Text: "I try not to inhale the acrid metallic smell of blood. I subtly cover my nose\
  \ so as not to offend any of the workers, but the stench pervades. My boots feel\
  \ grimy standing on the cement, wet with bleach water. I avoid stepping on the diluted\
  \ blood rivulets, or contemplating the difficulty of later scrubbing this place\
  \ off the bottoms of my boots.\n\nI stand in a Tuscan slaughterhouse, next to pigs\
  \ I had raised with my host family. The pigs\u2019 eyes meet mine with confusion\
  \ as they line up, tail to nose. I look away. They cram in between black metal bars,\
  \ their snouts waving back and forth over the backs of the pigs in front of them\
  \ looking for an escape. I watch as their realization sets in that there is no way\
  \ out.\n\nThe air outside chills \u2014 the signal to slaughter to avoid the risk\
  \ of spoiling the meat. I pull my sweatshirt tighter around my neck. \u201CYou ready?\u201D\
  \ my host brother Antonio asks me in Italian. I nod, fighting back tears. I\u2019\
  m not sentimental that they are going to die. I knew this was their destined ending.\
  \ I raised them for this purpose - to create beautiful Tuscan salumi for the family\u2019\
  s restaurant in town. But the sound of the pigs\u2019 desperate high-pitched squeals\
  \ reverberates off the sterile concrete walls. I sympathize with their fear.\n\n\
  Our pigs are white with a black sash around their shoulders. They are the ancient\
  \ Italian breed cinta senese from this small section of Tuscany that nearly went\
  \ extinct until the locals and the Slow Food movement revived their breeding. Their\
  \ fat is beautifully marbled - perfect for salumi. These pigs are raised on a diet\
  \ of wild forest, Tuscan hills, kitchen scraps, and organic grains that were plowed\
  \ next door just a few summer months ago.\n\nThe machine stretches out across half\
  \ of the slaughterhouse room. The pigs are prodded up the wedge single file onto\
  \ the ledge of the machine that holds the width of their bodies. A quick bullet\
  \ in the middle of their forehead and their consciousness evaporates. Their limp\
  \ bodies flop into the scalding liquid below burnishing their skin of any remaining\
  \ hair. Their bodies tumble through the machine, removing, separating, disarranging,\
  \ until their bodies hang in pieces on a conveyor belt. Seasoned butchers wheel\
  \ the parts like solemn morticians into separate rooms to be expertly sliced.\n\n\
  We send four pigs through the machine that day. And four more four weeks later.\
  \ Just enough to fill the restaurant with enough prosciutto, soppressata, coppa,\
  \ lomo, and leaf lard to last a year. \n\nThey were all female - older mothers who\
  \ couldn\u2019t breed anymore. Their lives had been humane and meaningful. Their\
  \ terrain stretched over wheat-covered hills. They meandered through cool forests,\
  \ eating chestnuts and mushrooms. They conceived and bred babies naturally and on\
  \ their own terms, raising their litters to maturity.\n\nI turn to look into one\
  \ of our pig\u2019s eyes as she waits her turn. I try not to anthropomorphize the\
  \ water in her eyes as tears, or how the corners of her eyes slope downwards as\
  \ sadness. I want to offer a sense of relief in her last moments - a last back scratch\
  \ or tummy rub \u2014 to connect one last time. Pigs\u2019 sense of smell is strong\
  \ and they are notoriously intelligent. In her eyes I see primal fear. She registers\
  \ the smell of blood as death. Death of her kind. Death of herself.\n\nOur pigs\u2019\
  \ death was no tribute to the life they had led. It was technical and detached from\
  \ the beauty of their lives. But at least we knew the meat we ate and served was\
  \ from the pigs we raised and lived alongside.\n\nWe take our butchered parts and\
  \ drive an hour to Sienna. For a week we work steadfastly alongside a master salumi\
  \ maker \u2014 slicing, rolling, hanging each cut. We cover the meat with fresh\
  \ rosemary and juniper berries from the garden. And when we finish, the meat honors\
  \ the land of its origin."
