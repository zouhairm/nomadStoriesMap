Text: "Not many would ever think they would find themselves saying \u201CI would have\
  \ been fine if only that cop had not given me all of that whiskey.\u201D  Yet this\
  \ particular morning near the Brussels train station, a bit drunk with a sprained\
  \ ankle and three minutes of sleep, those words fell out of my mouth.\n\nThe prior\
  \ evening I had been at odds with Sara, as she gets rather grumpy when unrested.\
  \  I needed space.  Our hotel sat on the very corner of a large cobblestone square.\
  \  On a bustling weekend you will find a vast flea market covering Place du Jeu\
  \ de Balle, vendors\u2019 wares under tents and on blankets, thousands of items\
  \ begging for another chance at life.  However, this was the middle of the night\
  \ in the middle of the week.   Yellow streetlamp orbs highlighting wet cobbled ground,\
  \ dancing around lifeless trees casting light and shadows across the puddles, beckoning\
  \ me into the calm.\n\nThe small hotel requests no use of the lift after curfew.\
  \  Unable to find the stairwell lights, I left anyway.  This did not prove to be\
  \ an issue until it did.  One short tumble later, my need for solitude pushed me\
  \ forward.  Having sprained my ankle in my fall from grace, it was evident.  This\
  \ was not my moment of absolute genius.\n\nChoosing to sit on the porch, I imagined\
  \ delightful faeries flitting about mid1800s architecture and brickwork.  Around\
  \ 2:30 I was ready to turn in when it struck me.  I forgot my key to the hotel\u2019\
  s front door.  I called the hotel, a fantastic idea except everyone was very much\
  \ asleep.  There I stood in the middle of January in pink Spongebob Squarepants\
  \ pajamas, no jacket.  In case you are wondering, third floor windows are quite\
  \ difficult to hit with pebbles (nearly impossible with my aim).  \n\nMaking my\
  \ way to the only street with any traffic, I flagged down a taxi asking him if he\
  \ could direct me to a police station.  He said \u201CGet in no charge\u201D.  I\
  \ was promptly deposited on the exact opposite end of the now dauntingly large cobbled\
  \ square.  Regardless of the station being closed, I thanked the man and began the\
  \ long hike back.\n\nHobbling back, trying to not aggravate my ankle further while\
  \ wishing the wind would give me just a few moments peace, I spot two officers enter\
  \ the square.  I gave the best account of the night\u2019s events that my French\
  \ allowed.  The taller officer asked three questions. Are you cold? Are you in pain?\
  \ Do you drink Coke or Coke Light?  Definitely. Yes. Coke Light.  He disappeared.\
  \  A third officer drove up, exchanged a few words, and drove off.  The taller officer\
  \ returned with a soda and a tall glass full of amber liquid.  \u201CWhiskey ok?\u201D\
  \ as he handed both over.  \n\nThe third man returned, passed out food and left.\
  \  I continued talking to them while I worked on my whiskey.  They were kind enough\
  \ to share their fries with me when the effects of the alcohol were becoming obvious.\
  \ I was far less uncomfortable as the light airiness which I now felt was exaggerated\
  \ by the surreal world surrounding me.\n\nWe made our way across what remained of\
  \ the square. All of the liquids gifted to me had began to take a toll.  I needed\
  \ a loo.  The brasserie was not open at 4:30 but I quickly convinced the baker to\
  \ let me in just briefly.  Upon my return to the hotel I found the officers debating\
  \ tactics. The shorter officer pulled out a knife.  Within minutes he proudly stood\
  \ up having broken into the hotel.   After many thanks I limped my way back upstairs\
  \ and into bed accidentally waking Sara. Clearly still unrested, \u201CIs all the\
  \ noise necessary?\u201D Within minutes I was asleep.  Unfortunately, the 5:00 alarm\
  \ was aware of the time and decided to make us aware as well.\n\nStill unprepared\
  \ for a truce as we went downstairs and out into the city, Sara noted that I was\
  \ walking far too slow.  \u201CWhat is wrong with you?\u201D she demanded.  \u201C\
  Food then explanation.  I would have been fine if only that cop had not given me\
  \ all of that whiskey.\u201D"
