Text: "I have been on this Earth from last 21 years , the journey has been quite fascinating\
  \ till now but not anymore, it's much of a miserable now I keep listening to such\
  \ things by great influencers and motivators I even read it many times in books\
  \ that \"make your self at peace\" \"follow your vibe you'll end up at peace \"\
  \ and all but now one tells where to find it and what it is exactly, do you know\
  \ ? \nSometimes I believe there's no such thing like peace in the world it's all\
  \ some kind of non existing Thing we all keep talking about to make everyone to\
  \ believe in something to keep going or to keep trying for the place you always\
  \ wanted to reach, it's to make everyone believe at the end you'll fine from all\
  \ the problems of yours. I hope I really do that peace exist somewhere because everyone\
  \ need it , you know what I actually believe peace meat to be different for person\
  \ to person some people tries to find it in wealth , for some people it is meant\
  \ to be better health , someone is heart broken they keep searching for it in some\
  \ other person who can make them feel at peace , some people make their peace in\
  \ their family , some got no idea where to find peace because they got everything\
  \ still something shallow inside them needs something they have no idea about that's\
  \ what makes them miserable for something this is what happens with me I got all\
  \ the love one can ever have I got loved by most of the Peoples I know I got money\
  \ , good friends , nice health still I feel like something is missing which is more\
  \ important than all of this none of this matter none of this makes sense without\
  \ it , but what it is ? I also don't know what I feel like missing it's just like\
  \ some part of me look for a place that doesn't exist and that's what makes me think\
  \ is that place called peace which has no specific place aur form of achieve it\
  \ .\nWhy all this makes no sense to many of us, why we all feel like giving up everything\
  \ just for that one place so badly , what if that place doesn't exist for real it's\
  \ just written in books and novels for making you believe so that it exist , what\
  \ if this all was a lie or I'm the one who got crazy in the search of this word\
  \ or term I don't know what \" PEACE\" . \nI hope that it must be beautiful , and\
  \ I wish you all will make your self at peace like they say in the end. For me I\
  \ don't know what it is where it is , all I know is I won't stop until I found it\
  \ because I'll not be satisfied if won't find it in this life because one thing\
  \ I Know satisfaction leads to peace that I believe. \nTo be continued...... \u270C\
