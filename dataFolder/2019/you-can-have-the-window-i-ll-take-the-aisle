Text: "I sat on hard plastic, occasionally nodding off in the heat of the crowded\
  \ third class train carriage, and cursed myself. I had meant to buy first class.\
  \ Useless fans squeaked overhead, and passengers stared vacantly out the window\
  \ from their perches on armrests and cramped benches. Sweat flowed in one continuous\
  \ line from the top of my head, down my back, to pool on my seat. My heavy pack\
  \ was turning my thighs into pancakes. The crutches I\u2019d been relying on for\
  \ the last week pressed deeply into my skin, pinned between the bag and my knees.\
  \ After a bad fall while rock-climbing, I was halfway through a long trip across\
  \ Thailand to convalesce at a friend\u2019s farm for a few weeks. I just wanted\
  \ to sleep.  \n\nA few hours later, the train stopped and a couple clambered out\
  \ of the buzzing darkness of the jungle. The man\u2019s button up shirt, which might\
  \ once have been white, hung loosely from his lean frame. His dusty brown pants\
  \ ended in haggard lines about six inches above his plastic sandals. Carrying a\
  \ huge sack of grain in front of him, he flashed a toothy grin at the whole car.\
  \ Whether the bag was his own harvest to sell in a larger village, or a purchase\
  \ he was bringing home, I\u2019ll never know. But there was no mistaking his giddy\
  \ expression of pride and exhaustion. He surveyed the car, uncertain and beaming,\
  \ until a tiny woman appeared from behind him in a faded green dress and laid down\
  \ one of the ubiquitous plastic-weave picnic mats I had come to associate with everyday\
  \ Thai life. He smiled at her and they sat down on the floor of the train. \n\n\
  As if finally given permission, more and more of the weary passengers found something\
  \ to sit on, whether it was a plastic bag or a dirty shirt pulled from a backpack,\
  \ and plopped down in the aisle. A man in a suit even pulled a sheaf of papers out\
  \ of his briefcase and laid them down like some ingenious makeshift quilt before\
  \ stretching out on it. There were perhaps ten people in the aisle now. They shared\
  \ a relieved smile. No one was trying to be stoic anymore. There was some gentle\
  \ chatter and laughter between them and everyone closed their eyes. \n\nMy apprehension\
  \ eventually gave way to envy; there was plenty of room on that floor. My benchmates\
  \ grumbled as I opened my bag and fished out a thin blanket. My joints popped and\
  \ burned as I pulled myself onto my good foot. I laid my pack on the floor in the\
  \ middle of the aisle and unfurled the sheet beside it. I looked around at a dozen\
  \ pairs of eyes peering at me.  Using a crutch for balance, I lowered myself to\
  \ the ground, falling the last foot or so with a thud. The man with the grin was\
  \ snoring against the wall of the car, cuddling the bag of grain in his sleep. His\
  \ companion, however, was looking right at me. And unlike the other inscrutable\
  \ faces, she was smiling. I shrugged a little. She grinned wider and gave me an\
  \ emphatic thumbs up, so I laid down and closed my eyes. As soon as I did, the car\
  \ around me exploded with whispers and snickering. My Thai wasn\u2019t great, but\
  \ I definitely picked up \u201CFarang,\u201D the word for foreigner. I worried that\
  \ I was offending people. I worried about missing my stop. But I didn\u2019t worry\
  \ long, because before long I was out.\n\nI woke up to a man shouting through the\
  \ car, \u201CKrasang! Krasang!\u201D The train was slowing down and this was my\
  \ stop. I scrambled to my feet, shouldered my pack, and turned at the door to wave\
  \ feebly at whoever was awake. The woman in green laughed and waved back as I hobbled\
  \ down the steps. A lot happened on that trip, I got lost in the jungle, I fell\
  \ in love, and I nearly got thrown in jail. But to this day, one of the moments\
  \ that keeps coming back to me is the silent connection between a bunch of tired\
  \ strangers on a train."
