Text: "Passport, wallet, backpack, motorcycle helmet, sunglasses, boots, and one last\
  \ look around the apartment. One last loving kiss and scratch to my dog Pickles\
  \ who knows something is up by my bag at the door. My ex will pick her up in an\
  \ hour and watch her while I\u2019m away, still Pickles\u2019 look of sadness is\
  \ tear inducing. I have everything I need for a jail break or at least that\u2019\
  s how this experience feels. \n\nFor the last 5 years, this apartment might as well\
  \ been made of cinder blocks with my landlord being the chain smoking warden. My\
  \ social life has been destroyed by my weight of depression. The dark emotions have\
  \ been my striped pajamas, who have been my only sense of warmth. My soul has been\
  \ crawling trying to leave my skin, so I needed to make a change. I\u2019m more\
  \ of the go big or go home type, instead of just going to visit friends a few hours\
  \ away. I\u2019m going solo across the Atlantic for the first time ever to meet\
  \ and rely on strangers from Scotland and Ireland. \n\nMy depression doesn\u2019\
  t believe in making any sense clearly. I stop at my door, this is it. Once I open\
  \ that door the guards\u2019 are going to open fire trying to wound my adrenaline\
  \ loving demon who hides deep beneath my soul. I close my eyes, one last deep breath\u2026\
  fuck it. I open the door to the blinding, roasting fireball settling over the Vermont\
  \ summer sky. I\u2019m a free man. Next stop, JFK airport in New York City. \n\n\
  I should have stayed home. \n\nThe strangers I\u2019m visiting have become friends\
  \ through Facebook. I joined a motorcycle group that is based out of Scotland and\
  \ Ireland. We all ride the same bike and parts are hard to come by in the states.\
  \ After a year chatting with the group, I decided I wanted to break out of my turtle\
  \ shell and go meet everyone in person. When I mentioned this journey, a few Scots\
  \ offered up warm beds and even a spare motorcycle to ride. I settled into my seat\
  \ as the plane began to rocket towards the stars. I slipped on my head phones, clicked\
  \ my Scottish playlist on and drifted out of consciousness to the sweet voice of\
  \ Lauren Mayberry\u2019s sweet Scottish accent.\n\nHow do you explain for border\
  \ security that you\u2019re here to meet online strangers that are part of a motorcycle\
  \ group and you\u2019re heading over to Northern Ireland? I was waiting for the\
  \ dogs to sink their teeth into my American flesh only for their disappointment\
  \ to realize it\u2019s not haggis. The officer asked where I\u2019m staying and\
  \ I tell her with complete uncertainty, Linwood. To my luck she is from that neighborhood,\
  \ and she then asks how am I getting there? I said taxi, but thought to myself,\
  \ if my friends aren\u2019t on the other side of that door, I\u2019m going home\
  \ with you. I wasn\u2019t sure if anyone was going to be there to pick me up and\
  \ I don\u2019t have a way to contact them. She wished me a pleasant trip and down\
  \ the hall I went. I begin to feel proud of how far I\u2019ve come to get to this\
  \ hallway.\n\nI grew up traveling thanks to my mother, by the time I was 8 I\u2019\
  ve been to every state on the eastern seaboard and Texas. It instilled in me a sense\
  \ of adventure and exploration. I grew up in New Jersey where I was exposed to cultures\
  \ and food from all over the world, it\u2019s this base that makes me feel like\
  \ home in the unknown. We have hit a point in society where we are being separated\
  \ by our differences instead of celebrating them. I rather cross borders than live\
  \ within borders. I reached the doors, closed my eyes, and took a deep breath."
