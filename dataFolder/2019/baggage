Text: "Everything hurt.  We sat cross-legged at the top of the Pyrenees mountains\
  \ on the first day of the pilgrimage, our bags tilted on their sides and bulging\
  \ like stuffed mushrooms.  Three women: one whose marriage was in savage freefall;\
  \ a second mourning the clustered deaths of her mother and sister; and the third\
  \ whose post-partum depression led to unemployment.  All walking to find some sign\
  \ telling us what to do differently, to hear some voice granting us peace.  \n\n\
  My father suggested it after I lost my job: join him in walking an ancient pilgrimage,\
  \ El Camino de Santiago Compostela.  I had seen the Martin Sheen movie and knew\
  \ that more than a hundred thousand people each year took the six-week trek across\
  \ the Iberian Peninsula.  But how in the world could I do that, with two young children\
  \ and no experience hiking?\n\n\u201CWe\u2019ll see,\u201D I told my father.  My\
  \ misery seemed too trivial, the maternal guilt too overwhelming, my income nonexistent.\
  \  \n\nFor days after he asked, I kept hearing, \u201CGo,\u201D from somewhere inside\
  \ of me\u2014even after he postponed his own trip.  In mid-October, not two weeks\
  \ into unemployment, I arrived with a borrowed backpack and not-broken-in hiking\
  \ shoes at Saint-Jean-Pied-de-Port, a pastoral, mountain town in southern France.\
  \  Either this trip would teach me how to relax and focus on what\u2019s important,\
  \ or all the walking might leave me strong enough to just walk away.  \n\nA pilgrimage\
  \ is not luxury travel; lodgings are spare and trim, \u201Clights out\u201D is strictly\
  \ enforced, and everything feels communal.  The first few days, the silence threatened\
  \ to drive me mad.  In the evenings, I began joining the circles of people gathered\
  \ around small, plastic tables in single-restaurant towns, listening to people with\
  \ whom I had nothing in life\u2014yet everything on the trail\u2014in common.  Still,\
  \ I felt unmoored.\n\n\u201CThe Way\u201D features several well-recognized stops,\
  \ along with many easily-forgotten ones: Hemingway\u2019s vacation home, Pamplona\u2019\
  s Plaza de Toros, and the soaring architecture of Burgos\u2014all spots around which\
  \ I would design a typical vacation, thrilled by their liveliness, raciones, and\
  \ cheap beer.  Now, city noises jarred me, and I hurried through them to the hostel\
  \ where I would pick my way through the pell-mell backpacks and shoes, check for\
  \ bedbugs, and flop onto the bed, consumed by every aching muscle.  \n\nI had few\
  \ thoughts of my children but knew they were safe shuffling between grandparents\
  \ and my husband when he wasn\u2019t working, back in the Midwest.  I pushed the\
  \ guilt from my mind.  I became comfortable in the rhythm of this new life: its\
  \ slowness, its intentionality.  I meditated on the feelings which gripped me during\
  \ the day and were lost as soon as my eyes closed at night.  \n\nAfter a particularly\
  \ brutal 17-mile day, I messaged my dad, \u201CEverything hurts.\u201D \n\n\u201C\
  Keep walking,\u201D he wrote.\n\nTears stung my eyes.  I began to turn outward,\
  \ listening to stories of my fellow pilgrims to forget my own.  At dinner one night\
  \ I asked a 19-year-old Italian traveling alone, \"Why do you walk?\"  \n\n\"I have\
  \ disease of the lung,\" he said, then sensing my alarm he sighed, resigned.  \"\
  It's curable; I need a surgery.  I will get this surgery when I return home.  I\
  \ am just frightened.\"  \n\nThere was something about how he told his story\u2014\
  the way he picked at the hongos and twirled his beer mug in a tight circle\u2014\
  that made me doubt him.  There is no cure, I thought.  Nothing is certain.  \n\n\
  I complained a little less about what hurt after that.  Perhaps we wander not to\
  \ get lost, but simply to lighten our loads.  Weeks later, that\u2019s exactly how\
  \ I returned home."
