Text: "When you think of Cabo, you probably imagine spring-breakers and bachelorette\
  \ parties, and you\u2019d be right.  But I was unprepared for the innate beauty\
  \ that lay before me as I disembarked the plane.  A mountainous backdrop framed\
  \ a vast desert nurturing an array of cacti.  It was reminiscent of Palm Springs,\
  \ but as my taxi driver Luis headed west, I rolled down my window and saw the sparkling\
  \ blue sea, the dryness of the blistering heat dissipating with the cool ocean breeze.\
  \ \n \nBefore I go any further, I have to be straight: I love ferreting around different\
  \ areas in search of my next best bite. I am a server at a local bistro in Malibu,\
  \ California.  I was in Cabo because I won an invitation to the The Los Cabos Wine\
  \ and Cheese Festival from a contest I had entered.  I was comped at the Sheraton\
  \ Hotel, where the event would take place.  On my salary, I don\u2019t get to hob-knob\
  \ at a classy hotel in a foreign land, so my excitement was through the roof.  It\
  \ was stunning with its classic Mexican architecture and rich ornamentation of hand-painted\
  \ ceramic tiles and beautiful Baroque-style arches, which reminded me of Rome, where\
  \ I studied abroad.\n \nAfter passing a lush infinity pool overlooking the Pacific\
  \ Ocean, the view of desert, cacti, palm trees, and the sea living in perfect harmony\
  \ was breathtaking. I headed over to De Cortez \u2014 one of Sheraton\u2019s five\
  \ restaurants. \n \nI tried to suppress the urge to throw on an apron and take orders,\
  \ but this was my Cinderella weekend and I tried to be as attentive as the waiter.\
  \ He brought me the meal\u2019s opener, which included bright, and plump oysters\
  \ from Ensenada. The pairing, a ros\xE9 from Casa Madero \u2014 the oldest winery\
  \ in the Western Hemisphere \u2014 cleansed the palate. My most memorable dish included\
  \ saut\xE9ed seared scallops and a creamy lentil soup with a foie-gras infusion\
  \ that was rich and comforting. As I got to the bottom of the bowl, the infusion\
  \ became reality: buttery foie-gras alongside crispy bacon. I felt like a kid again\
  \ with a surprise at the bottom of my Cracker Jack box.\n \nFollowing a good night\u2019\
  s sleep, I relaxed by the pool and enjoyed a pi\xF1a colada poured into a carved-out\
  \ pineapple, because when you\u2019re in Mexico, why not? After some rest and relaxation,\
  \ I got ready for the main event.  In its 6th consecutive year, the event had grown\
  \ larger this year with more than 700 attendees.  Most importantly, all proceeds\
  \ were donated to the Los Cabos Children Foundation, at 999 pesos per person.  \
  \  \n \nIt\u2019s no secret that Mexico\u2019s booze of choice is usually beer or\
  \ tequila. However, Baja\u2019s Valle De Guadalupe has become extremely popular\
  \ with wineries and restaurants popping up like wildflowers. With this in mind,\
  \ I looked forward to a sneak-peak of some of Mexico\u2019s best wines.\n\nAnd after\
  \ all the arduous wine tastings, I realized that Mexican wine is like online dating,\
  \ you\u2019re unsure at first but then you realize it can offer complex, bold and\
  \ exciting possibilities.\n \n \nI chatted with Ben Benoit, a winery owner in Ensenada,\
  \ and he said: \u201CThe Valle de Guadalupe is coming into its own and although\
  \ it started producing wine in the late 1800\u2019s, it wasn\u2019t until the 1960s\
  \ that the wine making industry started blossoming.  Now a younger crowd of University-trained\
  \ [Mexico, France, Italy] winemakers is taking over 160 large and small wineries.\u201D\
  \ He also informed me the gastronomy scene was exploding with tons of chefs migrating\
  \ south of the border.\n \nAs I contemplated the opportunity in traveling to the\
  \ Valle De Guadalupe scene soon, I noticed the packed dance floor. With a live band\
  \ and a light (or heavy) buzz, guests were dancing, drinking, eating, and enjoying\
  \ each other\u2019s company.  With wine flowing from every corner of the hacienda\
  \ ballroom, I was glad this Cinderella didn\u2019t have to worry about the clock\
  \ striking midnight."
