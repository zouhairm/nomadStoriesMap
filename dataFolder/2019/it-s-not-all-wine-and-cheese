Text: "In 2014, I did something  crazy.  At the age of 55 with no retirement savings\
  \ to speak of,  I sold my house, quit my job, put my belongings in storage\u2026\
  and bought a ticket to France.  Armed with a one year tourist visa, a suitcase and\
  \ my camera, I embarked on a mission to discover the land of my ancestors, the land\
  \ of wine and cheese.  I had visited briefly twice before but hungered to know so\
  \ much more.  I landed in Annecy, at the base of the Alps, and began an incredible\
  \ voyage of exploration, discovery and unexpected delights.\nI didn\u2019t know,\
  \ when I set out, that I would fall desperately in love with this beautiful country\
  \ that is so compact yet so diverse and full of history.  In France it is possible\
  \ to drive from north to south or east to west in a day\u2019s drive, all while\
  \ passing through regions and villages that have hundreds and even thousands of\
  \ years of history.  This created an opportunity for awe and wonderment every single\
  \ day of my journey.\nI dwelled in a state of awe and wonderment, over simple things\
  \ like buying Dijon mustard in Dijon to wild things like climbing the slightly nerve-wracking,\
  \ cliffhugging path to the ruined Chateau de Peyrepertuse built at the top of a\
  \ cliff hundreds of years ago without the marvels of modern day technology.  Awe\
  \ and wonderment were present when I climbed to the top of Notre Dame or the Arc\
  \ de Triomphe for stunning views of Paris but also when I climbed the 901 stairs\
  \ (give or take a few - I was also trying to breathe while counting!) to the Puy\
  \ de Sancy which is at the top of the Massif Central mountains, a volcano range\
  \ in central France.  I didn\u2019t even know there were volcanoes in France! The\
  \ drive up high mountain roads in the Pyrenees  to cross into the Principality of\
  \ Andorra or to reach the Col de Tourmalet, a mountain pass  famous on the Tour\
  \ de France circuit, also make the list of awe-inspiring experiences, not to mention\
  \ incredible photo opportunities.\nThere are so many discoveries on my list of unexpected\
  \ delights\u2026underground lakes, caverns full of stalactites and stalagmites,\
  \ turquoise blue seas, medieval village after medieval village \u2013 I laugh now\
  \ when I recall how upset I was when I missed an opportunity during my first three\
  \ weeks in the country to visit a well preserved medieval village.  Little did I\
  \ know that I would find such villages everywhere and that each one would delight\
  \ me more than the one before.  I found many, many wide expanses of sandy beach,\
  \ warm Atlantic water, castles and chateaux by the hundreds \u2013 I knew that France\
  \ was a land of fairtytale chateaux by I was quite surprised by the number, especially\
  \ in the Dordogne region which lays claim to being home to 1,501 chateaux.  \nOne\
  \ of the greatest surprises was the discovery of prehistoric sites in France.  There\
  \ are many caves containing prehistoric paintings that have been preserved or replicated\
  \ for the general public to view.  My trip to the land of cheese, wine, chic couture\
  \ and world famous monuments took a completely different turn when I realized the\
  \ depth of the history that was accessible.  The history of World Wars I and II,\
  \ the Renaissance, and medieval times kept me intrigued but the ability to view\
  \ prehistoric sites was far beyond what I had expected.  The highlight, and perhaps\
  \ most comical moment for me, was the visit to the site where Cro-Magnon man had\
  \ been found.  I have always thought the name cro-magnon  to be a scientific term.\
  \  When I found out that \u201Ccro\u201D simply meant hole in the ancient language\
  \ of the region and that \u201CMagnon\u201D was the name of the man who owned the\
  \ property on which the \u201Ccro\u201D was located and where the five skeletons\
  \ were found, I couldn\u2019t stop laughing.  I shook my head for days.\nAh France!\
  \ I went with wine and cheese in mind and found so much more. I left part of my\
  \ heart there and find myself, unexpectedly, homesick for the land of my roots."
