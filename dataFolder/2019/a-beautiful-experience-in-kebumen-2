Text: "This story started exactly one week before the most beautiful trip in the entire\
  \ season of my life. I got the information that there will be a culture event in\
  \ Kebumen, Center Java, in 28  April 2018.\n This event will be followed by 15-17\
  \ countries namely, Malaysia, Thailand, Russia, Japan, Indonesia, Holland, Pakistan,\
  \ Syria and so on. So, I and my friends registered it as the representative from\
  \ Indonesia. We were so busy with all of the requirements that have to be fulfilled\
  \ by each of us before the deadline whether about the performance that we were going\
  \ to perform or other things.\nAt the first day before we go to Kebumen. We prepared\
  \ the traditional dance from East Nusa Tenggara, one of the province in Indonesia,\
  \ called Tebe and the traditional song \u201CTasi feto No Tasi Mane\u201D. We did\
  \ it with spirit because we are boys not girls. So, it was a little bit hard for\
  \ us to do the dance as smooth as girls. But, finally we were ready for this event.\n\
  \ We can\u2019t wait for the departure so we woke up in the really early morning.\
  \ We gather in Jakarta and went to Kebumen at 13.56. That was such a really long\
  \ trip because we just arrived there at 3.00 o\u2019clock in the morning. When we\
  \ arrived there, The Santri, Islamic students who lived in the dormitory, hosted\
  \ us friendly. We were very tired and sleepy at that time, but We had not enough\
  \ time for sleep \u2018cause we had to join the opening at 8 o\u2019clock. \nAt\
  \ 7 O\u2019clock, we started our first day with had a breakfast together and had\
  \ some small talk with the santri. After that,we were brought by the santri to look\
  \ around the dormitory and they told the history of Pesantren Al-Kahfi, the name\
  \ of the dormitory. We were so excited to hear that because Al-kahfi is the first\
  \ Islamic dormitory that built in Southeast Asia and had become the center of Islamic\
  \ study since the first it is built. In the afternoon, we got a lesson how to make\
  \ batik, traditional clothe in Indonesia, by the batik crafter. The participants\
  \ whose came from overseas were very happy to do that because it was their first\
  \ time. After we finished make Batik, we had another activity which played Gamelan,\
  \ traditional musical instruments in Indonesia. Even though I am Indonesian, I don\u2019\
  t know how to play it so we learned it as new lesson together, we were truly enjoy\
  \ these agendas so none of us felt bored or sleepy. While, the activity was running\
  \ I was thinking that I am very proud to be an Indonesian cause many countries came\
  \ here, not only for see the beautiful of our landscape but also learn in the process\
  \ about our culture. We ended it up at 9 pm. The agendas went very well at the first\
  \ day,\n\nThe second day is more attractive, because we had agenda to go to mangrove\
  \ tourism and participate in preserving magrove trees. we are given 5 tree seed\
  \ to be planted in the sea banks. But before that, we were taught about good planting\
  \ methods so that the mangroves could flourish, this one is memorable. After which,\
  \ we went to Menganti beach. We did not use our bus anymore most of us prefer to\
  \ use the boat to the bus. The sea is so blue and very beautiful I was never being\
  \ so happy more than this one. After we got there, we did many things like; swimming,\
  \ shopping, taking some pictures and trying some traditional food. At 5 pm, we went\
  \ back to the dormitory and prepare for the closing. Before this even be closed\
  \ we as representative of our country have to show our traditional culture, we show\
  \ what we had prepared and we did the best of ours as well as the others. \n\nI\
  \ was very happy to join in this event because I got many friends from other countries\
  \ and learned many things at the same time. I realized one thing, that we could\
  \ be Unity in our great diversity if we try to open and love the other."
