Text: "I had all the fun seeing the tombs of the Pharaohs and excitement filled my\
  \ face. Soon I didn't know what i was into.\nI got to the Reception of the Valley\
  \ of Kings indeed feeling like a King. I proceeded to the Parking Lot and that's\
  \ how it hit me. My Cab had left. Right. It was no where and had seemed to vanish\
  \ out of thin air.\nI dialed the Cab Driver (at the Reception) and he was somewhere\
  \ and for sure he had headed back to the City of Luxor.\nWith no local currency\
  \ on me and an ATM in a place with no ATM machines, reality hit me. I had to find\
  \ my way back to the city as soon as I could. The Thought of Twilight setting on\
  \ me lost in a place I didn't know made my fears out grow me. 'What exactly could\
  \ happen to me as I head back to the city?' I didn't know and I wasn't hoping for\
  \ anything bad. My contact to the person in the City had remained with my notebook\
  \ in the cab. And also having no local number to be contacted incase my Contact\
  \ got worried was also something to have me frightened.\nThere was no way I was\
  \ going to stay at the Valley of Kings for a night, I thought. I tried hiking rides\
  \ in vain. Putting reality into context, if I was the one at a back of a cab and\
  \ being stopped by a Foreigner for a Ride, in the middle of nowhere probably I would\
  \ have asked my cab driver to proceed. I could understand and clearly read the expressions\
  \ on the faces of many Tourists' whose rides I tried to hike.\n\nWith the mercy\
  \ of Google maps, I began to walk on the road amidst the Heat and the baking sun.\n\
  \ I woke to find myself trundling through a huge, bleached white desert stretching\
  \ out as far as I could see. Only the occasional spectacular rock formation broke\
  \ up the ocean of sand as it jutted up towards a sky.  To the side of my pillow\
  \ lay two cans of peach flavoured non-alcoholic lager - a gift from a friendly fellow\
  \ passenger who had insisted that I take them as I was crawling up into my bunk.\
  \ \nMy journey through Luxor Desert could not have been easier. As soon as I walked\
  \ into the nearest Village Center, I had been taken under the wings of the friendly\
  \ locals and guided up towards my surprisingly comfortable high rise Horse Carriage.\
  \ Soon after lying down at the back of the Carriage, I was drawn into a deep, fulfilling\
  \ sleep by the relentless rhythms of this galloping iron horse. \nAs our carriage\
  \ rumbled on though this wide open space, one of the oldest cities in the world\
  \ began to emerge from out of this brutally beautiful wasteland. Like a mirage set\
  \ amongst the desert haze, the wind snatching towers and the holy minarets thrust\
  \ up from the sands towards the unforgiving sun. \nI was in the city by Dusk, and\
  \ my only worry was how to find my contact person."
