Text: "My grandmother took me to Puebla, as a birthday present; to this day it still\
  \ is one of the most wonderful experiences I've lived. Upon arriving at the hotel\
  \ I was amazed at its architecture, it looked like something from out of a movie.\
  \ After getting settled we decide to got out for dinner, the streets had mixes of\
  \ modern architecture and 70s style homes, the plaza were we ate was filled with\
  \ flowers, vendors and artists.\n\nThe next day we decided to go to the market,\
  \ again the mixture of modern business with stores for the occult was breathtaking,\
  \ one of the most peculiar things was the pavement, some paths were painted and\
  \ upon following them it lead you to the local church, the ground was coverd with\
  \ different mosaics, and statues were surrounding it, the garden it had was mostly\
  \ cover with bushes and trees. The church happened to be closed that day so we didn't\
  \ see the inside, so we went back to the market, in one of the market stalls a woman\
  \ was selling \"moving dolls\" curious I asked her what she meang by it, she went\
  \ in and brought back a puppet, she showed me it had no strings, no batteries and\
  \ nothing that would make it move on its own except \"magic\", she \"fed\" her doll\
  \ and put it on the ground, I was shocked and freaked out when the doll got up and\
  \ started walking around, she tolds us that if I wanted one I had to be serious\
  \ about it because once you \"bonded\" with one it would never go away, to this\
  \ day I still have no idea how she made the doll move. \n\nThe next day we travel\
  \ to Huasca, first we went to a \"Elve museum\" the owner talked to us about the\
  \ different artefacts that made people belive in mischievous elves and stories about\
  \ people meeting them, the d\xE9cor\xE9 of the place was beautiful and brightly\
  \ colored, almost fairy tale like. After we went to Huascas waterfall, the stones\
  \ shined as if made of glass and the water was absolutely sparkly, some vendors\
  \ were at the entrance selling crystal gems and small shiny pebbles as souvenirs,\
  \ I still have the flower shapped bracelet my grandmother bought me.\n\nThe rest\
  \ of the expirience was way more calm, mostly shopping at the market and the local\
  \ mall."
