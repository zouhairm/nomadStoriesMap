Text: "\u201CI\u2019m sorry guys, I\u2019m going to be on the phone most of the night,\u201D\
  \ he shot us an apologetic look as he walked into our shared hostel room. I can\u2019\
  t remember how many beds were in that room\u2014 maybe ten?\u2014 but I\u2019ll\
  \ never forget the people staying in them that night.\n\tI was in England with a\
  \ friend. We were supposed to stay in Manchester, but a change of plans led us to\
  \ what may be the cheapest hostel in London. Our last-minute booking meant we were\
  \ switching rooms every night. On this night, our second last, we walked in and\
  \ snuggled up to watch Notting Hill, a very on-the-nose preparation technique for\
  \ plans the next day. \n\tWe were about to drift off when two guys burst into the\
  \ room. One pokes his head into our bunk and introduces himself. His name is William,\
  \ he is from the American South, and he is so charismatic, he could talk to a wall.\
  \ It\u2019s well after midnight when he walks in\u2014 the guy in question, on the\
  \ phone. His pre-emptive apology turned out to be entirely necessary. \n\tDuring\
  \ a lull in the hushed phone calls, William slowly begins drawing pieces of the\
  \ puzzle from him. He lives in Berlin. He is a music producer. He got into music\
  \ because of his godfather, whose funeral he is heading toward. When he talks about\
  \ this godfather, he lights up, but there is also a look of devastation there. The\
  \ death had been sudden. \n\tWe wonder, what instruments did his godfather play?\
  \ All of them, he replies. Do we have known any of his music? After some hesitation,\
  \ he tells us\u2026 maybe. Have we heard of Raspberry Beret? \n\tHis godfather was\
  \ Prince. \n\tI meet William\u2019s gaze across the dim room, our eyes wide. We\
  \ want to know more, though we don\u2019t want to pry. But the godson, he opens\
  \ up once the secret is out. His parents had owned a music shop near Abbey Road.\
  \ His father couldn\u2019t stand The Beatles because they always hit on his mom,\
  \ and had raced around Hyde Park with the Rolling Stones. Prince had taught this\
  \ guy how to tie his shoes. In these stories, he wasn\u2019t the mythical character\
  \ he is to the rest of us. He was a father figure, a mentor, a friend.\n\tIn the\
  \ morning, the godson was on his way to Minneapolis to pay his respects to his godfather.\
  \ William was off to Italy, and my friend and I had a date with Notting Hill. The\
  \ world seemed a little more compassionate that day. The chefs at the Italian restaurant\
  \ off Portobello Road made my pizza heart-shaped, and sang as they tossed the dough.\n\
  \tThe five of us in the hostel that night had little in common, and I doubt we will\
  \ ever cross paths again, though I hope we do. In spite of its metal bunk beds and\
  \ threadbare carpet, that room fleetingly became one of the most beautiful spaces\
  \ I have ever inhabited. When I look back, I imagine it more like a campfire, a\
  \ beacon that drew us in to tell our stories as we warmed ourselves around the shared\
  \ human experience."
