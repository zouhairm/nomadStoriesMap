Text: "Hitchhiking had been a breeze all the way from Berlin to Florence, but after\
  \ two hours standing on the side of a road in Puglia, Italy, my skin was pink as\
  \ sushi ginger, sweat was a bee sting in my eye, and my arm trembled at weight of\
  \ my outstretched thumb. \n\n\u201CYou should just take the train,\u201D someone\
  \ said. \u201CIt\u2019s easier.\u201D \n\nI turned, ready to rant about how such\
  \ a luxury went against the principles of my trip, which basically involved suffering\
  \ as much as possible for the sake of saving a few euros, but the words caught in\
  \ my throat. It was Pepe, the insane tamburello player from the drumming festival\
  \ I had just attended. Only yesterday, my jaw had dropped at the sight of him thrashing\
  \ away like a dislodged airplane propellor on the leather, then pressing the drum\
  \ to his face, ear and elbow in order to produce different tones, all the while\
  \ wailing out lyrics detailing \u201Chis own personal mythology.\u201D\n\n\u201C\
  I\u2019m getting my ticket now,\u201D Pepe said. \u201CCome on.\u201D\n\nA train\
  \ ride with a madman. How could I say no?\n\n--------\n\nIn southern Italy, the\
  \ cicada calls are as incessant as the blazing sun. Walking through an olive orchard\
  \ in July is like swimming through sound: sweat falls from the forehead in great\
  \ resonant beads, and the sizzling brain can no longer distinguish between what\
  \ is seen and what is heard. Since time immemorial, folk musicians, barely able\
  \ to hear themselves over the screaming insects, have had no choice but to synchronize\
  \ their rhythm to nature\u2019s metronome: \u201Cchaa-chaa-chaa-chaa-chaa!\u201D\
  \ \n\nProof of this is the tamburello, a kind of giant tambourine typical to south\
  \ Italian pizzica music. As the jingles hiss, the drummer\u2019s free hand pounds\
  \ thunderously against the skin. The result is a looping groove which causes the\
  \ spine to itch and even the most reticent of feet to dance. It is said that pizzica\
  \ perhaps goes all the way back to pagan times, when the music was used to induce\
  \ a trance state. This is not surprising, given the region\u2019s proximity to Northern\
  \ Africa, where trance rituals are practiced even to this day.\n\n--------\n\nAt\
  \ first our talk was incredibly small. Then Pepe said, \u201CLet\u2019s go to the\
  \ bar.\u201D After a couple drinks, the talk got larger.\n\n\u201CI\u2019ve been\
  \ called upon,\u201D Pepe said.\n\nI gulped. \u201CBy who?\u201D\n\nPepe looked\
  \ me in the eye conspiratorially. \u201CBy the drum god.\u201D\n\n\u201CThe drum\
  \ god?\u201D I repeated in lieu of an intelligent response.\n\nPepe nodded gravely.\
  \ \u201CHe was the very first god, who pounded the black leather of the void and\
  \ produced the vibration that became the universe. The drum god has many prophets,\
  \ but I am the principle prophet of the tamburello.\u201D\n\nI watched in awe as\
  \ Pepe\u2019s shaggy brown mop-top, enlivened by the humid air, swirled around him\
  \ like a halo of flame.\n\n\u201CInteresting,\u201D I said. \u201CAnd how do you\
  \ serve him, exactly?\u201D\n\nPepe\u2019s pupils dilated with the black leather\
  \ of the void. \u201CBy breaking open the tamburello. By showing people the possibilities\
  \ are infinite.\u201D\n\nHe was delusional. He was a megalomaniac. He was one hell\
  \ of a tamburello player. Most traditional musicians dedicate themselves to preserving\
  \ the boundaries of the art, so it can be passed down to the next generation unscathed\
  \ like a precious family heirloom, but a few, like Pepe, seek to shatter those boundaries.\
  \ Here was a guy so uninhibited he could play a drum with his face and on top of\
  \ that make it sound good. He was weird all right, weirder than a three dollar bill\
  \ -- and I was envious.\n\nI had nowhere to sleep that night, so Pepe invited me\
  \ to his place. The tamburello prophet, it turned out, lived with his mom. Over\
  \ the course of the evening, we toured around his small town. At the beach, ants\
  \ infested our bag of chips. At the ancient Norman castle where young people break\
  \ in to drink in the night, I fell in love with a new Italiana each time I blinked\
  \ my eyes. Above, the full moon shone down like a tamburello, and if you squinted,\
  \ you could see the face pressed against it."
