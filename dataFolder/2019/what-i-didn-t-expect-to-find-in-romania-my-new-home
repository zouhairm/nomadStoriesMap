Text: "There are moments in life that we dream big and so great are those dreams that\
  \ we make them as plans, but we know that they are not going to happen. So it began\
  \ like that\u2026 A journey that began with a casual conversation and a dream of\
  \ finding ourselves somewhere else.\nThat was how I met AIESEC, travel to be a volunteer.\
  \ AIESEC, which in the immensity of opportunities is a ray of sunshine for those\
  \ who, like me, think of a trip abroad in not an easy thing. However, this decision\
  \ was motivated by something different: Friendship. In a time where the loneliness\
  \ tormented me and the urge to get away from so many things that were happening\
  \ in my life ended up taking me to Romania, hand by hand with one of my best friends.\n\
  Both of us knew that this trip meant completely different things to each one, even\
  \ our motivations; however, we wanted  to venture together to new experiences and\
  \ simply enjoy our friendship.\nToday I know that a trip is not only the time you\
  \ actually spend outside home, there are a lot of things before getting there, the\
  \ decision seems easy but you are not really aware of everything that\xB4s going\
  \ to happen, how much you are going to change and that nothing in your life will\
  \ ever be the same. \nAfter months of planning it, I arrived to Romania, an extraordinary\
  \ country, full of history and beautiful castles. A country like no other, however,\
  \ hidden, and little known when someone thinks of going to Europe. That\xB4s how\
  \ I got there, to a country I knew nothing about, that\xB4s why I decided to go\
  \ there. \nCluj-Napoca was my home for six weeks, where I was able to find happiness\
  \ as pure as I\xB4ve seldom felt it, where everything fitted perfectly, where I\
  \ thought \u201CI could live like this the rest of my life and be very happy\u201D\
  . Cluj stole my heart, I close my eyes and when I think of it, it looks like the\
  \ most beautiful city I have ever seen, I can still feel the excitement of the first\
  \ time I saw, heard, smelled and felt it. \nCluj-Napoca is a small city compared\
  \ to others; it has clean air. Its buildings, churches and streets are accompanied\
  \ by the tangle of cables that goes through the whole city. Romanian flags are all\
  \ over the place, and needless to say, every step you take you are going to find\
  \ a Shaorma place.\n\nThis experience was something completely new for me, I met\
  \ people from very different parts of the world, where the only thing in common\
  \ that we had was that we were volunteers. So many cultures, and very different\
  \ religions came all together in a few bedrooms, four floors that were our home.\
  \ For six weeks we share food, dreams, laughs, small trips, work days, bus rides,\
  \ games, songs, party time, sunsets, long nights, rainy days, AIESEC roll calls,\
  \ Mexican nights, a lot of Turkish culture, fun and above all lots of love. \nI\
  \ was not prepared for an experience like this, I didn\xB4t know what to expect.\
  \ Being a volunteer is to leave a bit of yourself, share with many people a piece\
  \ of who you are, is to know a city as if it were yours, is to have a routine, to\
  \ go beyond the tourist areas, knowing that you\xB4re going to live the daily life,\
  \ what people normally do that is usually hidden to the tourists. Being a volunteer\
  \ is to leave a small seed hoping that in some way it will germinate and grow in\
  \ a positive way for the future our world. \nWithout a doubt, as well as it began,\
  \ it ended up being a trip motivated by the friendship, hoping to meet every one\
  \ of my new friends in some other place of the world. Today, seven months later\
  \ I think of Romania with my eyes full of tears, with an immense desire to return\
  \ to their lands, breathe the air and hug their people, a place that gave me so\
  \ much affection, love and happiness."
