Text: "As I bite into the juicy, spicy corncob for the second time, he tells me he\
  \ was only twenty-two. Only twenty-two years old when he illegally crossed the border\
  \ on foot from Nepal into Tibet. \n  \u201CIt was 1975 and Tibet was not open to\
  \ tourists.\u201D Kevin whispers, as if he still might get caught.\n  \u201CI wasn\u2019\
  t scared. I was young.\u201D\n  We eat dinner at the same table tonight: Kevin,\
  \ Graham, Mark and myself. Kevin and Graham are strangers, we met them just a couple\
  \ of minutes ago. We are now sharing a three-course meal and intimate conversations.\n\
  \  \u201CYou\u2019re from Australia? I worked in Australia about 30 years ago. Somewhere\
  \ up near Darwin, have you been there?\u201D \n  \u201CI was born there 31 years\
  \ ago.\u201D \n\n  A few moments earlier Mark and I had been walking down a street\
  \ with a long and complicated name, something starting with the letter K. We met\
  \ this street today; we met this city twelve hours ago. \n  We were still in that\
  \ mode where your eyes dart constantly as you walk, feverishly trying to keep up\
  \ with your steps in the distance they cover. Everything is crying to be seen. You\
  \ feel a bit overwhelmed, a bit in love with everything, and very hopeful. \n  The\
  \ commotion, the sound of happy chatter, and the warm evening light coming in through\
  \ the large windows in the back was what caught us both. An awkward peek, more sustained\
  \ curiosity, and then our feet followed our eyes and suddenly we found ourselves\
  \ inside the arcade style alleyway.\n  A collection of quaint looking shops lined\
  \ the edges and an abundance of big tropical pot plants drew us inward. The floor\
  \ was a bold chessboard pattern of white and grey. A tall, smiling blond man appeared\
  \ in front of us.\n  \u201CAre you here for the Everybody Eats event tonight?\u201D\
  \n  We had no idea what he was talking about and instinctively took a step backward,\
  \ afraid we had intruded.\n  \n  In fact we were very welcome here. It turned out\
  \ that Everybody Eats literally meant \u2018everybody eats\u2019. Including us,\
  \ a couple of curious backpackers in sweaty headbands and worn hiking boots. Including\
  \ the smart looking lady with curly grey hair and glasses at the end of our table,\
  \ and the two men in suits behind, sitting next to a young man in a torn and dirty\
  \ shirt. \n  With little shame or embarrassment, we all sit together at long tables\
  \ in this cosy arcade on the street starting with the letter K. The idea is that\
  \ you pay what you can, but there is no pressure to pay anything at all. There are\
  \ three courses, each thoughtful, balanced and healthy. The food is rescued from\
  \ waste, cooked up and served by generous volunteers.\n  \u201CI come here each\
  \ week to meet new people and hear their stories,\u201D said Graham. He is a pastor\
  \ and has lived here for four years. He\u2019s a long way from Darwin now.\n  \u201C\
  There is a similar event run every Tuesday in front of the library, I go to that\
  \ one too\u201D said Kevin. We don\u2019t know much about his present life, but\
  \ we do know that he was an avid traveller in his youth. He walked out of Tibet,\
  \ without getting caught.\n  \n  I was expecting to walk back to our run down hostel\
  \ and eat another bland bowl of pasta with a tin of tomatoes and a bit of grated\
  \ zucchini. I was expecting to scroll through the Internet and find something else\
  \ to discover in Auckland tomorrow.\n  I didn\u2019t expect to find this. \n  I\
  \ found out later that Everybody Eats opened in St Kevin\u2019s Arcade in Karangahape\
  \ Road Auckland in 2017 as a pop up social experiment. The aim behind the idea was\
  \ to break down social barriers and address issues like hunger, poverty, social\
  \ isolation, food waste, sustainability and climate change. It is completely non-profit,\
  \ and relies on volunteers.\n  \n  I barely have enough room for dessert. But the\
  \ oozing crumble is too delicious, and I don\u2019t want to leave just yet. I can\
  \ taste hope and I can also taste in some part my future; there is something in\
  \ this community I have to bring back home with me."
