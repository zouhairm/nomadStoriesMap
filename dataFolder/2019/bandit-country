Text: "Bandit Country\n\n'Don't take anything valuable with you. That place is filled\
  \ with wild bandits', the old Tibetans said, passing me a yak bone handled knife,\
  \ to slice a piece of meat off the bone.\nFor nine hours, we bounced along dusty\
  \ dirt roads, wound through snow peaked mountains and lush green valleys, happily\
  \ crammed in together, laughing, \u2018oohing\u2019 and \u2018aaghing\u2019, clutching\
  \ onto one another, as the bus wove around high mountain passes, balanced on narrow\
  \ cliff edges and splashed through rocky streams. This was was the Wild West of\
  \ Central Asia, the borderland between the old tribal provinces of Kham and Amdo,\
  \ inhabited by wild animals and nomads with their horses, sheep, yaks and black\
  \ yak hair tents.\nNearing the end of the journey, a concrete slab oddly appeared\
  \ from the landscape, the door swung open and out marched a man, dressed in a khaki\
  \ police uniform. Ethereally floating down a long pathway towards us, l realised\
  \ this was border control and we were entering a restricted zone.\nl slunk down\
  \ in my seat, nervously watching him surreally approach, dressed smartly in his\
  \ uniform, polished brass buckled belt, shiny black boots and moustache curling\
  \ upwards towards his ears. What is this regal looking Indian doing out here, manning\
  \ this outpost, l wondered. \nThe whole situation seemed incongruous to me and I\
  \ held my breath, until he waved us on and we continued towards the world\u2019\
  s biggest annual nomadic Tibetan gathering. \nI quickly became enamoured with the\
  \ nomads, with their elaborate dress, gold teeth and long knives slung off their\
  \ hips, especially the women, whose long black hair, decorated with amber and turquoise\
  \ reached down their backs. They beamed smiles of golden sunshine at me when l stunned\
  \ them with communicating in their language.\nSuddenly, a young Chinese policeman\
  \ appeared in front of me and in broken English, stuttered and stammered, asking\
  \ me for my passport. Plunging into the crowd, l tried to lose myself, but he soon\
  \ reappeared with another policeman, demanding to see my papers.\n\u2018I don\u2019\
  t have my passport on me\u2019.\n\u2018In China, you should always carry your passport\
  \ with you. This is a restricted area. You can\u2019t stay here\u2019, he barked.\n\
  Flanking either side of me, they marched me back through the gasping crowd, who,\
  \ stepping aside, created a vacuity, sucking us into the jeep and back to the police\
  \ station, where l was grilled for an hour about who l was, what l was doing, if\
  \ l spoke Tibetan, who l knew, where l stayed and where my passport was. Becoming\
  \ more and more heated, they rang their boss on the Chinese Tibetan border where\
  \ lies one of the biggest prisons. He insisted the two policemen drive me the nine\
  \ hour journey back to the village to collect my passport and report to the police\
  \ station. \nPausing at the guesthouse to get my bag, the cook asked me in  Tibetan\
  \ what was happening, causing me to panically shake my head and the police to look\
  \ at me quizzically, as l had denied knowing the language. Speeding out of the village,\
  \ the Jeep screeched to a halt at the police checkpoint. The regal looking Indian\
  \ policeman appeared, waving his arms and yelling at them to get me and my stuff\
  \ out of their car and pointing for me to go to the nearby crossroads. Although\
  \ not understanding a word he said, leaping out, l made my getaway.\nLooking into\
  \ the distance, l saw a van hurtling along towards me, with joyful folk music blasting\
  \ out the windows. Screeching to a halt, the driver, a long haired wild looking\
  \ young Tibetan man, signalled for me to jump in. For four hours, l couldn\u2019\
  t speak, fearing they were secretly conspiring with the police. \nOn a high mountain\
  \ peak, they stopped to relieve themselves and enjoy the view. Looking out across\
  \ the vast landscape, with its snow capped mountains and cloudless blue sky reaching\
  \ out into infinity, l realised that if not them, then who could l trust, for these\
  \ lawless wild nomads l had been warned to protect my valuables from, were a pure\
  \ force of nature, steeped in ancient lore, saving me from pirates of the law."
