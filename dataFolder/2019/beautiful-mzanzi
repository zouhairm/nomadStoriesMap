Text: "So a few years back I decided to actually start travelling and not dream about\
  \ it. I told myself, I'm going to start taking trip around South Africa to learn\
  \ more about my beautiful country and beautiful people. South Africa has 9 provinces\
  \ and 11 official languages, I can speak 6 of them and understand 2 more maybe.\
  \ I was born in Soweto( Gauteng) but lived part of my life in Polokwane(Limpopo).\
  \ These happened to be the two provinces I knew. Every year I then decided to take\
  \ a shotleft ( short trip) and visit one neighbouring province. I started with Mpumalanga\
  \ and had to visit it several times to get the most of it. Mpumalanga has a vast\
  \ Scenic view, starting from Byde River canyon which is a river that run between\
  \ the Drankensberg mountain. It is 25km long and about 750m deep. If you love nature\
  \ then you really need to visit this place. Burkes Luck Potholes would be the next\
  \ on the list, they where formed by water erosion years ago. One of the most incredible\
  \ art made by nature. The air around there is amazing. We then moved to Sodwana\
  \ caves, the caves are set to have been formed 240 million years ago. It a bit cold\
  \ and wet down there so be careful. Other points are a bit tight as well. You need\
  \ to see the beauty for yourself to admire it. A few waterfalls can be seen around,\
  \ Bridal veil falls being the best for me. You can also learn about Shangana Culture\
  \ at Shangana Cultural Village. You will be exposed to their way of living, rich\
  \ heritage and learn a move or two while at it. If I talk about Mpumalanga I would\
  \ not be able to tell you about other part of this amazing country. \n\nAnother\
  \ town to visit when you are in the Free state is Clarens, It was our stop over\
  \ to Port Shepstone in the Kwa Zulu Natal. Clarens is a small town that is surronded\
  \ by mountains was established in 1912 . Before you get to this small town there\
  \ is an interesting stop you need to make, its called Lesotho highlands water project.\
  \ This is where water from Lesotho is supplied to South Africa. I have always known\
  \ that some of our water was from Lesotho but didnt know how it got into this country.\
  \ I was very excited to be at this spot. Clarens has this old town feel and its\
  \ so calm for a city person like myself. Things to do around here includes river\
  \ rafting, Hot air ballooning, Abseiling and fishing. This town is often referred\
  \ to as Jewel of Free state because of its Titanic Rock, but now I know why. Its\
  \ is one of the refreshing places you can visit in the Free state.\n\n\nAs you go\
  \ pass Clarens you heard towards Maluti Mountain in the Golden Gate highlands national\
  \ park, these mountains are majestic. They are the highlands of the Kindom of Lesotho.\
  \ The scenery here is out of this world with the roads twisting and turning around\
  \ the mountains. There are countless mountain passes, roaring rivers and the most\
  \  unpredictable weather. You just want to get out the car and take it all in. The\
  \ Landsape, even the pictures I took did not do justice to the place. It is a long\
  \ drive but worth it. As you drive by do not forget to visit the Basotho Cultural\
  \ Village, accept their hospitality by taking a sip of their traditon beer( Jwala\
  \ ba sesotho) and engage in a game of Morabaraba. Consult Ngaka( traditional healer)\
  \ for an advise. \n\n\nIm still on the journey around South Africa. My next stop\
  \ is Port Shepstone, 6hrs from Clarens. A lot of people visit Durban in Kwa Zulu\
  \ Natal and not the surroundings which are so much better. A stop at Oribi Gorge\
  \ will be one of the highlights, it is a lush forest area. One of the highlights\
  \ of South Coast. It offeres spectacular scenery including the Samango Falls, wildlife\
  \ and fantastic bird watching. A photographer\u2019s and nature lover\u2019s dream\
  \ and offers wide panoramic views across the landscape. I am stil exploring South\
  \ Africa everyday...."
