Text: "I sat in the front seat of a local taxi as we coasted down the busy Autostrad\
  \ approaching Old Cairo. We passed the wondrous medieval citadel and mosque of Muhammed\
  \ Ali before crossing four lanes of dense traffic to our exit. We zipped by a donkey\
  \ cart, four grown men aboard a motorbike, and a teen sitting high atop a stack\
  \ of furniture in the bed of a small truck. Nine months ago I would have been stomping\
  \ on the imaginary brake and clenching my sweaty palms as we narrowly avoided a\
  \ dozen accidents and seemingly broke every law. But this is no concern now, it\u2019\
  s just life in Cairo as I know it.\n\nA strong sense of adventure had slowly built\
  \ within me up to this moment. After living in Egypt for almost a year and checking\
  \ off all of the sightseeing \u201Cmust do\u2019s\u201D, I sought to immerse myself\
  \ more in the local community. I bought produce off of the local farmer\u2019s donkey\
  \ cart, baladi bread fresh from family-run clay ovens, and practiced Arabic with\
  \ anyone who would humor me. \n\nI hoped to make another connection in the Moquattam\
  \ Hills of Cairo where there exists an area called \u201CGarbage City\u201D and\
  \ the zabaleen (garbage people). As the name implies, the place is chock-full of\
  \ garbage and emits a pungent odor that immediately leaves you breathless upon entering.\
  \ Heaps of Cairo\u2019s trash surround you and people of all genders and ages squat\
  \ along the roads to sort the garbage that collects here without end. Bags of food\
  \ scraps are hoisted into the air and disappear onto the roof where geese, pigs,\
  \ and goats are kept for eventual slaughter. Plastic bottles and aluminum cans are\
  \ compressed into cubes three meters high. Machinery sounds from every direction\
  \ as young boys, fresh out of school, blast music while driving their tuk-tuk. \n\
  \nCuriosity of Garbage City first struck me while riding with some expats to a popular\
  \ bazaar. They had lived here several years and had quite a negative impression\
  \ of the zabaleen, due primarily to the smell that lingers over parts of the city\
  \ when trash is burned. I feared that if I did not visit the zabaleen, I might take\
  \ on these notions myself, perhaps unjustly. \n\nA local guide, Bekhit, agreed to\
  \ show me his neighborhood for the next two days. I would discover unique stories\
  \ first and foremost from the zabaleen, but also pigeon fanciers, loom workers,\
  \ and a French nun. Bekhit lives in Garbage City with his wife and four children,\
  \ a boy (12) and three girls (10, 6, 3). Their community of zabaleen is about 90%\
  \ Coptic Christian and 10% Muslim, the exact opposite of the rest of Egypt. The\
  \ mood was noticeably tense when I visited as just the day before, a suicide bombing\
  \ occured at St. George's Church in the northern Egyptian city of Tanta. At least\
  \ 30 people were killed and the government had declared a state of emergency. Everyone\
  \ I met expressed concern not only for their own well being, but also for me, a\
  \ foreigner. Apprehension consumed me at times throughout the visit, yet there was\
  \ a strong instinct to connect with these people and uncover their true story. \u201C\
  Kullu tamam (everything\u2019s fine)\u201D, I always replied.\n\nAcross from one\
  \ of their cave churches was one of the most spectacular murals I have come across.\
  \ A Tunisian-French artist, eL Seed, painted a unique work of art that touches a\
  \ few dozen buildings. From just the right location each piece comes together to\
  \ form a brilliant multi-color circle with an Arabic message roughly translating\
  \ to, \u201Canyone who wants to see the sunlight needs to wipe his eyes first.\u201D\
  \ These words ring true no matter where you go, but particularly so when visiting\
  \ the underrated zabaleen.\n\nThrough recycling and repurposing, the zabaleen are\
  \ turning one city\u2019s trash into their own treasure. While their home is not\
  \ the most pleasant sight to behold and the smell remains with you long after leaving,\
  \ you have to admire the work that goes on here. There is a beauty that lies at\
  \ the hearts of these people, and once you have left here, you will forever be changed."
