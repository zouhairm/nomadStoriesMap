Text: "It was August 2016, and I had finished up my one-year contract as an Au Pair\
  \ in Luxembourg. For months I had anticipated and planned my next move, to Berlin,\
  \ Germany, where my friends lived. Although I had not found a job, I was told that\
  \ I had ninety days before I would have to return to the USA. A month passed, and\
  \ I still could not find an employer who would sponsor a work visa in Berlin. I\
  \ either did not have the exact qualifications, or needed to improve my German speaking\
  \ skills fast! In a moment of desperation, I took the advice of a friend and began\
  \ my job search in other German cities. I found luck in Munich. \n\nI had never\
  \ been to Munich, and I did not know what to expect, but my friends in Berlin gave\
  \ me warnings of an inhospitable environment. Looking for a place to live was grueling,\
  \ and I began working, as I continued to try and find a place to live that was not\
  \ temporary. \n\nDuring my first year of acquainting myself with my new city, I\
  \ joined online groups to meet people and find new friends with similar interests.\
  \ Since Munich tends to be more expensive than Berlin, I did not have a lot of extra\
  \ income to pursue everything my heart desired. I explored my free options more\
  \ often than not. I was thrilled to discover a free yoga in the park event! As the\
  \ day approached, and the weather turned our forecast into a rainy day, the yoga\
  \ session was rescheduled. I maintained contact with the organizer for updates,\
  \ but time passed and the event was cancelled. I gave up hope on my chance at free\
  \ yoga. \n\nThe first year, I lived in four different apartments and finally found\
  \ a lease for one year, with the possibility of an extension. It was closer to work,\
  \ but much farther from the city center. Little did I know that the yogi who had\
  \ planned, and cancelled, the free yoga in the park was also living in my new building.\
  \ It was too much of a coincidence to not be fate. However, I felt nervous for some\
  \ reason, and thought it was best to avoid him at all costs. I recalled my older\
  \ sister telling me about how awkward it was after she once slept with someone in\
  \ her old apartment building. So, my plan to live comfortably would have to include\
  \ no interactions with him. \n\nI did pretty well the first two months, only seeing\
  \ him in the hall once or twice and saying a polite \u201CHello\u201D, before darting\
  \ away. Then he posted another event online, and I responded. I didn\u2019t expect\
  \ to find my new best friend, but that was only the beginning. \n\nOver the next\
  \ few months, we began spending time together every week, and then everyday. We\
  \ ate dinner together, went grocery shopping together, traveled together, and made\
  \ plans to move together. It was like a marriage (especially since there was no\
  \ sex), but from the start he told me that he was not interested in me romantically,\
  \ and we were better off as friends. Subconsciously, I hoped his feelings would\
  \ change. Then we decided to go to Prague for one week and things exploded! \n\n\
  We were always very honest with each other, but I think we also danced around some\
  \ topics to avoid hurting the other person. As the deadline for our plan to move\
  \ got closer, feelings built up, and then were unleashed! We got in a huge argument\
  \ and decided that it would be best to cancel our impending plans, or lack thereof.\
  \ \n\nWith our plans cancelled, which seemed to be an ongoing theme in our friendship,\
  \ I ended up returning to the United States. Afterwards, we managed to stay friends\
  \ and still talk from time to time. A lot of soul searching and growth happened\
  \ during our time together, and for that I will always be thankful."
