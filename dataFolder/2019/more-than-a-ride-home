Text: "On a chicken bus with Sandinistas by chance?  Maybe not. \n\nWe mischievously\
  \ crept up the steps of the bus that was our magic carpet ride back home, to Managua,\
  \ Nicaragua. The warm night air that twirled around the necks of those who came\
  \ to Esteli to celebrate life became the silent still Sunday morning. I was alarmed\
  \ that there was not a taxi in site. My friends and I were oblivious to why crowds\
  \ of people were filling up these buses and heading to the capital. All we knew\
  \ was that we had a way back home.\n\nOn this worn yellow bus, you could find sons,\
  \ uncles, brothers, grandfathers, and childhood friends. While others searched for\
  \ seats, I noticed the letters FSLN on a man\u2019s shirt. I recognized it from\
  \ tagged walls near la Universidad de Centroamericana. It stood for Sandinista National\
  \ Liberation Front. In that moment, I didn\u2019t know what it stood for or even\
  \ knew much about the revolution, but this intimate journey to Managua, exposed\
  \ me to what those letters really meant. \n\nThe loud tenor hums of the bus were\
  \ upstaged by the stoic strokes of guitars in the Sandinista Anthem. Unsettled bodies\
  \ began moving and singing along to the music. Bottles of Flor de Cana kissed the\
  \ lips of the men. A boisterous man leaned into every note, holding some longer\
  \ than others. He beckoned my brother to dance with the same bottle he stole a kiss\
  \ from seconds prior. His titled baseball cap attempted to hide the years he\u2019\
  d been blessed with. Breaking my stare, I was met with faces that reminded me of\
  \ home. They danced and sang the fight songs. The songs that let them know who they\
  \ were fighting for and who fought for them; songs of gallant jubilee; songs that\
  \ was like our \u201CAin\u2019t Gonna Let Nobody Turn Me Around\u201D and \u201C\
  The Revolution Will Not Be Televised\u201D. \n\nAs we passed through the city, proud\
  \ women and children stood in their front yards waving their FSLN flags, seeing\
  \ us off. The bus driver honked as we hooted out the window. The forestry trees\
  \ that once lined our path had turned to open fields of grazed land. This allowed\
  \ me to rest. \n\nMidway through the journey, you either slept, conversed, or entertained\
  \ yourself. The Sandinista playlist was on a loop. Despite not knowing the details\
  \ of the revolution, by then, I knew the ad libs of the songs. \n\nThe sun exhorted\
  \ a heat wave that woke me. The bus had become tranquil. Many slipped into slumber,\
  \ except a few, including the boy with vampire-like eyes. He hung off the seat,\
  \ facing the back of the bus, looking for a fervent trouble, one that allows laughter\
  \ to escape the bellies of comrades. He began throwing paper at my friend\u2019\
  s head. I assume as a pastime. \n\nWe stopped. People rushed off the bus. The men\
  \ lined the fences as the women darted behind distant bushes. \n\nA vendor carrying\
  \ large bags hopped from one bus to another, shouting, \u201CPollo! Fresca! Papas\
  \ fritas!\u201D Many of us were hungry and thirsty. He passed out different flavored\
  \ juices like Communion from his large plastic sac. I snacked on papas fritas con\
  \ salsa picante. I didn\u2019t know how long this expected 2.5 hour trip had been.\
  \ Time did not exist on this journey. \n\nWe continued. \n\nAs we got close to Managua,\
  \ we became a procession, celebrating lives lost and lives won. Bus after bus coming\
  \ from cities like Granada, Leon, and Matagalpa, filing into one line. Small red\
  \ and black flags waved out the windows. Women and men shouted at each other and\
  \ at those who had ears to hear. Melanated limbs flailed out windows. Horns honked.\
  \ Their excitement was contagious. I too began celebrating. We finally made it.\
  \ \n\nWe bled into the city; here to commemorate the Sandinistas and their allies\
  \ who helped end Somoza\u2019s dictatorial regime in the Nicaraguan Revolution.\
  \ \n\nThe Trees of Life guided us to the jamboree, the celebracion de la libertad.\
  \ During my seven hour ride, I witnessed the liberty, pride, and honor that comes\
  \ with being a Sandinista. \n\nMy journey on this chicken bus had not been chance,\
  \ but a fostering summon."
