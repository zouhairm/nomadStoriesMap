Text: "As part of our final year in secondary school, every social science students\
  \ is obliged to go for a field study in Geography so as to be able to answer a question\
  \ in the final examination called the General Certification Examination. Here in\
  \ our school Government Bilingual High School Nkambe ( G.B.H.S ) we the students\
  \ about  50 students plus the teacher  decided to go for our field trip to lake\
  \ Oku. The reason we chose Lake Oku is simply because we are going to passed through\
  \ Ndu Tea Estate and study the weather station before we continue our journey to\
  \ the lake. Why chose the lake my parents ask me? Lake Oku from what we hear is\
  \ natural with a lot of feature to study, also concerning the formation of the lake,\
  \ it has a lot of interesting stories which is good for us to find out. Also we\
  \ chose the lake because we are going to pass at the weather station found in estate\
  \ and do some study about it, in fact our field trip to Lake Oku is going to be\
  \ an adventurer trip. \nAt about 8:30 AM from a distance we so a green field just\
  \ like a football field, same high, same color about 10000 hectares our teacher\
  \ Mr. Boris \u201Clook that is the tea farm and we are going to stop there to study\
  \ the weather station before we continue our journey to Oku\u201D. Then he ask us\
  \ a question what is unique about the tea farm? I answered by telling him the levelness\
  \ of the farm, the green nature of the farm, the surrounding of the farm which is\
  \ surrounded with trees and the workers doing their work. Mr. Boris please no noise\
  \ from anybody and the teacher presented our permission to the security guard indicating\
  \ that they are expecting us today. The main reason is to study your weather station.\
  \ We were taken to the weather station of the estate by the manager right in the\
  \ center of the tea farm. The manager said one of the main reasons of having a weather\
  \ station is to study the weather that affects the tea farm positively and negatively.\
  \ The measurements we take here mostly are temperature, atmospheric pressure, humidity,\
  \ wind speed, wind direction and precipitation. Nelson which is one of the student\
  \ asked a question why some instruments are exposed and some are not.  The response\
  \ from the manager was simple, he said some of the instruments need direct exposure\
  \ to what they are measuring like the rain gauge, anemometer but the rest need should\
  \ be sheltered in a vented box like this one usually called the Stevenson Screen\
  \ to keep direct sunlight of the thermometer and wind off the hygrometer  the manager\
  \ said. The environment was calm with fresh air breeze, no distractions from moving\
  \ cars and no dust in the air since it was in the dry season. It was about 10:30\
  \ AM that we continue our journey to Lake Oku.\nWe arrived Oku at about 4:00 PM\
  \ and as part of Africa culture, you can\u2019t enter a place without seeking permission\
  \ from the highest traditional ruler of the land and that apply to us, we can\u2019\
  t explore the lake without seeking permission from the gods and it is done through\
  \ the Fon of the village His royal highness Fon Ndifon the 3 of ok. He welcomes\
  \ us in his palace and with great joy. He told us how the lake was form. He said\
  \ the was a great fight between Oku and Mbesa over the lake. He took us to the lake\
  \ and he did some incantation after he smile saying that we are welcome to study\
  \ the lake and surroundings. On our way we discovered that is Oku is very hilly\
  \ and beautiful water falls from some of the hills, very thick forest and also animals\
  \ like rabbits, monkeys and snakes are found in the forest. The lake is always calm\
  \ as we were told by our host, we saw some fishes on the surface and there is a\
  \ big hall for visitor like us to rest. We were shown where people usually swipe\
  \ and the limit they can reach."
