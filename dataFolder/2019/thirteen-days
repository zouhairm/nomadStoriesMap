Text: "It was Thirteen days after Hurricane Harvey had catapulted unimaginably in\
  \ to Houston Texas on August 25. I was living in tropical Key Largo, and had just\
  \ started a new job and about to sign a lease for a cozy home. That is when Hurricane\
  \ Irma decided to make an appearance to the Keys. Thirteen Days had past since my\
  \ parents life had been tossed upside down in Texas, and I was about to see why.\n\
  Thankfully, I was able to find a way out of  a hurricane in less than 12 hrs, and\
  \ caught a flight headed for Texas. Everyone has a story, whether it was a good\
  \ one or horrible one,  I knew I would be expecting devastation and loss , unfortunately\
  \ for me it was much worse.\nAs I greeted my father, I could see in his eyes, the\
  \ sleep deprivation, the utter shock, the \u201CI\u2019m holding in my emotions\
  \ for my family\u201D, and it shook me to my core.  I had never seen that look in\
  \ his eyes, and his smile so distant ,as if it were painted on to hide something.\
  \  Something, that would not go away so easily. He drove his car down the roads\
  \ of our subdivision, music off, only the sounds of the rubber tires hitting pieces\
  \ of particles left over from the storm. My eyes widened as they focused on debris\
  \ mounds as high as a small tree, that filled the front yards of our neighbors.\
  \ My heart beat slower and my stomach had butterflies, waiting as our house came\
  \ into view.\nI gulped to hold back any emotions that were thinking of making a\
  \ scene, and braced myself, you see I too, like my father held emotions in to be\
  \ strong.  Placing my hand on the silver door handle, cold from the air vent that\
  \ I had moved, clicked open. As the polluted sun hit my face so did the stench of\
  \ the piles and piles of mold and mildew. Being careful of where I put down my rubber\
  \ soled shoes, I carefully emerged from the car, the steel object that was shielding\
  \ me from the truth. \nAs I walked behind my father, streams of memories floated\
  \ past me like it was a dream, flashbacks of nostalgia that had taken me and my\
  \ sister through childhood, stacked on top of eachother like they were building\
  \ a bonfire. \nUnlike my Father, my Mother wore her emotions on her sleeve, and\
  \ when I saw her in the house with a mask over her face cleaning, she gave me a\
  \ look that said it all. The flood waters that had once rose in the streets, were\
  \ coming out of her eyes like a message in a bottle was waiting to be opened.  And\
  \ it did.\n  In that moment looking around the house I once lived in, all I could\
  \ think was, I wonder if I will have a home in Florida to come back too. A radio\
  \ that was plugged into a faulty outlet,  in what was once a kitchen, alerted the\
  \ residents of Florida for a Category 5 Hurricane.  I didn\u2019t expect to find\
  \ this..Thirteen days after. What will the next Thirteen look like for me?..."
