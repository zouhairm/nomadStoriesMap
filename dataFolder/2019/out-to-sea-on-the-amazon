Text: "The boat is a medium sized one, and the nets hang from either side of the rafters.\
  \ Six of us pile in easily and take a seat. Naxi starts the motor and off we go\
  \ to join in the queue \u2013 first in line for the morning trawl. This morning,\
  \ Naxi\u2019s is the first boat on the river but he explains that this is not always\
  \ the case. It makes all the difference getting in line early because the first\
  \ trawl can often be the best one. But this of course all depends on the weather,\
  \ the tide and the moon.  The windless weather, high tide and small moon.\n\nToday\
  \ is a good day. The tide is high and the water is murky. The best time to fish\
  \ for prawns.\n\nI sat and listened as Naxi explained to us the art of fishing on\
  \ the Amazon River. Number one. It is in his best interest to keep the river healthy\
  \ and full of fish. Without a healthy river, there are no healthy prawns and without\
  \ healthy prawns, Naxi can\u2019t run his family business.\n\nThe nets are fit for\
  \ purpose \u2013 the holes are the perfect size to catch adult school prawns and\
  \ leave the young ones to mature. This is the breed we are after.  School prawns,\
  \ I learnt, are deliciously tasty for human consumption and can keep fresh for up\
  \ to six days if they aren\u2019t frozen.\n\nUnfortunately, much of the catch is\
  \ used as bait by recreational fishers as consumers increasingly go for cheaper,\
  \ bigger imported prawns.\n\nThe question that ran through my head that day was\
  \ how can one person catch so many prawns and have this be a sustainable practice?\
  \ So I asked. As usual, I asked all the questions.\n\nHow long does it take for\
  \ a prawn to reproduce? How many eggs do they lay at once? Does the trawling damage\
  \ the bottom of the river? Is there bycatch? And I received answers. Naxi was very\
  \ knowledgeable and happy to share with us his vast knowledge on the topic.\n\n\
  School prawns spawn hundreds of thousands of eggs at once and have a lifespan of\
  \ about 18 months. Once they spawn, they die. They are bottom feeders so spend the\
  \ majority of the time lurking on the bottom of the river. That\u2019s why murky\
  \ water is good for fishing. While we complain about a rainy day, the prawn fishermen\
  \ are usually pretty happy with the outcome.\n\nTrawling the bottom of the Amazon\
  \ does not result in the same destruction as it can in the ocean. There are no coral\
  \ reefs or seagrass beds to destroy.\n\nWe leave for the first trawl at 5:30am.\
  \ I watch as the nets drag behind the boat for 15 minutes. In comes the first catch\
  \ of the day. The bottom of the net is opened and the prawns are released onto a\
  \ stainless steel tray. As they flipped about, Naxi goes through the tray and removes\
  \ any bycatch, throwing it straight back into the water."
