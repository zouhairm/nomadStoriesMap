Text: "Black. Soot black. \nHis hair, the only part of him not covered by a blanket,\
  \ stuck up greasy and curly from baby soap. This was our introduction.\nHis mother\
  \ had gone to a social worker when he was three weeks old because it was becoming\
  \ more costly to care for him. We began that day unaware of each other\u2019s lives,\
  \ until the social worker called the baby home.\n\u201CI\u2019ll be dropping off\
  \ a month old boy,\u201D she said in a hurry.\n\nIt had been three months since\
  \ I had begun volunteering in a Johannesburg baby home, where four more experienced\
  \ women already spent their days caring for infants waiting to be adopted. Other\
  \ babies had already come and gone, but this one was different to me. The first\
  \ time I saw him, he was already bathed and dressed in cartoon robot pajamas.  We\
  \ welcomed him with distressing joy; a little boy slept in a stranger\u2019s house,\
  \ and somewhere that night, a mother was going home without her baby. He broke into\
  \ a smile and the other caregivers cooed with me. \u201CHave you ever seen anything\
  \ this darling?\u201D\n\nThere are no instructions for falling in love- it\u2019\
  s not science- but I think it must happen this way: Blow bubbles on his belly as\
  \ you dress him in the morning. Hold your breath the first time he laughs.  Dance\
  \ with him in the kitchen. His cheeks grew indiscernibly chubby; ruby shaded; made\
  \ his eyes disappear when he smiled.  \n\nCaring for babies peeled away all of the\
  \ shady hues in my life- the housemother\u2019s hands held the world together by\
  \ kneading bread; the way baby boy looked at his mobile was like an astronaut seeing\
  \ earth for the first time from space. All orphan care involves an element of distortion,\
  \ and brokenness shouldn\u2019t be romanticized, but what other explanation could\
  \ there be for devastation like this than that molecules and atoms had no choice\
  \ but to explode from trying to contain such wonder. Baby boy, he was the most iridescent\
  \ thing to be born from chaos.\n\nHe left the way he came. In rainbow blurs. \n\u201C\
  The social worker called,\u201D the housemother measured yeast into her dough, \u201C\
  and his mother wants him back. She shows up in the social worker\u2019s office daily\
  \ looking for him.\u201D \nMy heart thrummed quiet. \nShe loves him with the fierce\
  \ love of a mother, she can\u2019t feed him, and this is not her fault. How mangled\
  \ stories are sometimes. \n\nThe social worker passes the room where my shoulders\
  \ are heaving in secret.\n \u201CAre you going to be okay with this?\u201D She asks\
  \ gruffly. \nI pause.\n\u201CI don\u2019t know.\u201D But really, I wanted to say\
  \ I\u2019m trying to, I swear.\nI had watched the housemother whisper a prayer for\
  \ only them two and kiss his face for the last time.\nThen the social worker had\
  \ driven on, taking him far into the impoverished land where he is not unique. From\
  \ his car seat, he\u2019ll pass a ratty sign and barbed wire into a township strewn\
  \ with fatherless infants and unprotected women.\n\nThe first night after he left,\
  \ the municipality switched off all electricity. The sky turned amethyst with storms\
  \ while we stood around holding our palms against the sockets praying they would\
  \ feel our heat. A tinned roof house, an urban area, and five women trying to fortify\
  \ a baby against everything; this is how realms collide.\n\nFriends on my weekly\
  \ Skype call are puzzled at my grief. \n\u201CHe wasn\u2019t yours, you know.\u201D\
  \nOf course I know. But my heart still believed my arms that had held this baby,\
  \ the voice that hummed lullabies over robot pajamas, and the hands that shook bottles\
  \ to appease three am screams- all these nerve endings designed to signal belonging.\
  \  \n\nI crave retreat, but the housemother leads us on by unflaggingly stretching\
  \ out her arms to the next marvel who needs a home. Three million orphans live here\
  \ in South Africa, and for that we take up our place to fill the gaps in universal\
  \ guardianship. \nThe social worker texts us. \u201CHe has arrived back home safely.\u201D\
  \ \n\nI pack away his clean robot pajamas. Electricity is switched back on. The\
  \ bread rises."
