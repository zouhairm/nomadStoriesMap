Text: "Moments With Election Riggers\n\nAs we arrived at Disu, an area in Orolu Local\
  \ Government, Osun state, Nigeria, the mood of our motorcyclist changed from excitement\
  \ \u2014 informed by his sense of business \u2014 to that of apprehension. The tall,\
  \ fair son of the soil began to shiver, chattering like a toddler and twittering\
  \ \u2014 a twitter freighted with fear. \"If I had known we would journey this far,\
  \ I wouldn't have agreed to convey you guys. Look at it now, there is trouble everywhere;\
  \ everybody is shouting; they say they couldn't vote; they were not allowed to vote.\
  \ Do you think this trip would be safe?\" the man protested.\n\nI shunned him, pretending\
  \ not to hear the premonition in his narration. \"Calm down, man! Are you not a\
  \ man? We are also strangers here. Nobody ever thought it would be this terrible,\"\
  \ Dammy, a co-reporter, replied him.\n\nI had journeyed 176 Kilometers from Lagos\
  \ to Osun state \u2014 as a student reporter \u2014 to cover a rescheduled rerun\
  \ election earlier declared inconclusive by the Independent National Electoral Commission.\
  \ But unlike the main election, the rerun was full of tragedy.\n\nThe fear to be\
  \ fair, so as not to be democratically forced out of government, made the ruling\
  \ All Progressive Congress (APC) to devise all possible means to execute vote heist\
  \ on a grand scale that would help offset the deficit recorded in the first round\
  \ of  the voting exercise declared inconclusive. The People's Democratic Party (PDP)\
  \ was not also left out of plotting some political ploys to overcome the demigod\
  \ party, having been marginally ahead of APC with 353 votes before the election\
  \ was declared inconclusive. \n\nAn inch forward, there was a dramatic show of anger.\
  \ A man, encircled by both area and media men, was voluble. He was shouting at the\
  \ top of his voice with the veins in his neck standing in bold relief as if they\
  \ would burst. \"Look at it, look at some of the bullets shot at some of our people\
  \ earlier this morning,\" lamented the man, pointing at some two wasted bullets\
  \ on the ground.\n\n\"What was our offence?\" he asked,  furiously. \"We were not\
  \ caught courting the wife of their governor neither were we caught stealing the\
  \ ballot boxes, yet they were running after our lives. Even the policemen who were\
  \ supposed to be guarding us were rather guiding them, shooting at us sporadically\
  \ and making us teary-eyed by firing teargas.\"\n\nAs we traversed Kajola from Disu,\
  \ our motocyclist sang scary songs, silently, not even the reporter behind me could\
  \ hear him. The breeze blew his tiny voice in the air; I carefully listened as he\
  \ sang like an ancient troubadour, while he rode  speedily.\n\nThe road to Kajola\
  \ was a death trap. It was besieged by forests so thick that, they are capable of\
  \ accommodating wild animals. On the road, there was an exchange of duty between\
  \ violence and silence. Violence would come first and silence would follow for few\
  \ minutes before violence would break the silence again.\n\nAmidst the thick bush\
  \ of political ambush, we turned up at Kajola. Voting had started. Confusion beclouded\
  \ everywhere. The Kajola Community Primary School, a delapidated building where\
  \ the election was held had been turned to a mini-mart of vote buying and selling.\n\
  \nFear was noticeable in everybody's face, including the policemen. \"No escape\
  \ route here. Only one road leads to this place as you have all witnessed. Any attempt\
  \ to do anything funny won't be funny for you guys,\" a dark pot-bellied policeman\
  \ warned reporters, wondering \"why they made this horror place a polling unit.\"\
  \n\nOn our way back from Kajola, still riding pillion,  hardly did we travel for\
  \ 5 minutes at a stretch without being stopped by armed thugs. Frontwards, there\
  \ was a blue-painted bus ahead us. The bus which was crowded by armed hoodlums,\
  \ was a big hindrance to our movements. \n\nWith terrible feelings, I escaped the\
  \ tense terrain and headed to the collation center where Gboyega Oyetola would be\
  \ declared the winner of the violent election race. I thought the election would\
  \ be peaceful but it ended up bloodily and with a wounded heart, I traveled back\
  \ to Lagos, where I came from."
