Text: "On November 2018 me and my friend were looking for a breack from university,\
  \ a breath of fresh air. Why not looking for an adventure, a unique journey? So,\
  \ taken by the moment and by the discounts on the planes, we, by now \u201Cnonconfrmist\
  \ travel buddies\u201D, decide that December is a great month to travel. We had\
  \ only to decide one of the European cities that fascinated us the most. Both eager\
  \ to explore France, looked for the first cheapest flight from Palermo, and we find\
  \ it for Marseille. It would have been our mooring point, because soon, the desire\
  \ to explore, makes us think that in four days we can move from one city to another.\n\
  Finally we set foot on French territory, we immediately start from Lyon, not from\
  \ Paris, as tradition would like. Lyon, la \"petit Paris\" as I like to call it.\
  \ An elegant, charming city, with so much to offer, and at the same time on a human\
  \ scale. We fall in love with Lyon and its wonders, the locals and French food.\n\
  Two days later we continue with Avignon, a dip in history, we feel small inside\
  \ those medieval walls. In only 5 hours in the afternoon, like lightning in the\
  \ blue, we manage to see everything in time. We even manage to find the elusive\
  \ bus station in a remote parking lot on the banks of the Rhone. Don't ask me how,\
  \ it's a story on wich we often laugh about.\nAnd at last but not least, Marseille.\
  \ The beautiful and underestimated by many, Marseille. We dedicate her the last\
  \ night and the last day before the departure. Definitely a summer destination,\
  \ being on the C\xF4te d'Azur, but we choose to see her in December. Good nonconformists\
  \ and savers girls. Continuing with gloves and scarf, that had saved us from hypothermia\
  \ in Lyon and Avignon (I'm kidding! Or maybe not?) and no swimsuits. Maybe we'll\
  \ come back \"ma belle Marseille\". You are more beautiful than many people can\
  \ say.\nWe were a bit superstitious about the success of the adventure when it was\
  \ taking shape on our mind map, we almost didn't want to admit it to ourselves,\
  \ before leaving, that perhaps we had been a bit too daring. Anyone said us: \"\
  Three cities in four days?!\"; \"What are you going to do in Marseille? There is\
  \ nothing!\"; \"All these buses? You\u2019ll not see anything!\". What to say, the\
  \ seed of mistrust began to be planted, but the centuries-old tree of audacity was\
  \ deeper. Against every nefarious prediction, in spite of the clich\xE9s, we dive\
  \ into this self-organized journey not knowing what to expect. We find ourselves\
  \ winners in front of breathtaking views, problem solving, without leaving anything\
  \ to the unturned or unexplored. We made the right choices and we lived one of the\
  \ most unique and rare experiences of our lives. We have known so many people to\
  \ lose count. Everybody wonderful, profoundly different, but united by that dream\
  \ longing that only the journey can give. Both if it is lived with their own eyes,\
  \ or through those of the interlocutor whose feet perhaps come from distant and\
  \ mysterious lands. \nWhen everybody asked us back if we had fun, my answer was\
  \ and will continue to be: we got tired, we walked 20 km a day, but we would do\
  \ it again. We have rediscovered ourselves in other lights. French lights. Those\
  \ of communication at 360 degrees, even with those who do not want to communicate\
  \ (because yes, not all French people want to speak other languages, but we love\
  \ them also for this); those of the friendship that sometimes makes you angry, but\
  \ then passes with a laugh that lasts hours; those of tiredness, aware that if you\
  \ have the right person next to you, it seems to be divided in half; those of the\
  \ adventure that sometimes frightens, but that you face with courage for the sake\
  \ of knowledge. Yes, because \u201Ctraveling\u201D is \u201Clearning\u201D. Learn\
  \ to find the good and beauty where you would never imagined it existed. Learning\
  \ to rejoice, to love, to live.\nGood road to all travelers who dream with open\
  \ eyes and heart in hand, always."
