Text: "Built on juxtapositions, Ho Chi Minh City flourishes on exhausting contradictions\
  \ only deepening its charm.\n\nThose contrasting elements can be found every 20\
  \ meters or so at com tam stands where one cannot eat without dancing with danger.\
  \ \n\nCom tam is a simple meal consisting of broken rice, a choice of protien, veggies\
  \ and a small bowl soup. \n\nOn the one hand, com tam is a relatively safe bet.\
  \ I see my food choices sitting right in front of me, so I can decide for myself\
  \ if something does not appear edible. Ordering also requires little language, mostly\
  \ hand gestures. Therefore limiting the odds of receiving something I did not want\
  \ to about a 10 percent.\n\nHowever, com tam stands would also never pass health\
  \ codes in the United States. The amount of violations any given stand would receive\
  \ would make national headlines at home. In fact, it would be so atrocious that\
  \ it would actually be humorous. \n\nBut this is Vietnam. And it runs on com tam\
  \ stands like the US runs on fast food restaurants. So I eat at them and throw a\
  \ silent Hail Mary I won\u2019t find myself violently ill the next morning.\n\n\
  Let me be clear: I am grateful that Vietnam does not prioritize sanitation because\
  \ a Ho Chi Minh City without com tam stands is no Ho Chi Minh City for me. \n\n\
  I can\u2019t say definitively what makes com tam addicting and lovable. In theory,\
  \ it should be nothing special: rice, protein, and a bowl of soup that is basically\
  \ just lukewarm water and some leafy greens. \n\nYet, they bring such overwhelming\
  \ satisfaction. I never leave a com tam stand feeling like I cheated myself out\
  \ of a filling, healthy meal. Or perhaps it is the affordability that makes com\
  \ tam so irresistible. I pay only 25k VND ($1.07 USD) for full plate of food. That\
  \ makes sense: cheap, healthy, and satisfying. Three logical reasons to love com\
  \ tam. \n\n\nBut, being the romantic I am, I believe love should be based on more\
  \ than just logic. \n\nWhen I say I love com tam I mean I love it for more than\
  \ out of basic necessity; I love the atmosphere of the entire com tam experience.\
  \ \n\nIt\u2019s quick, but not in a way that makes me feel rushed. I can add as\
  \ much sauce and spice as I want and I\u2019m likely sitting beside people I don\u2019\
  t know either on a busy, city sidewalk or along a gravel road.\n\nSchools in Vietnam\
  \ break for nearly two hours midday. While I found this absurd initially, I now\
  \ see the major lesson those two hours can teach me: the art of dialing down my\
  \ speed. An uncomfortable task for an American. \n\nThe locals look at me funny\
  \ because I like to use chopsticks while I eat despite the spoons right in front\
  \ of me. Sometimes they even offer guidance, pointing at those spoons. I just smile\
  \ and shake my head \u201Cno.\u201D \n\nFirstly, I think chopsticks are fun and\
  \ will use them at every opportunity. Secondly, they force me to slow down. I must\
  \ take my time and taste each bite. I will not not shovel my food in my mouth like\
  \ a rushed American, stressing about teaching my next class. I want to be here,\
  \ in this moment, savoring not just the food but the seconds, too. \n\nDuring lunch\
  \ at a com tam stand I have the opportunity of forgetting. I forget about my previous\
  \ lessons. I forget I have afternoon classes. I forget about tomorrow\u2019s workload.\n\
  \nInstead, I remind myself where I am at the very moment: Ho Chi Minh City. Half-way\
  \ across the world and enjoying com tam on the side of the road I cannot pronounce.\
  \ \n\nI let everything else go for an hour or two and inhale this insane and extraordinary\
  \ experience.\n\nI just be. I acknowledge that tomorrow - or even the following\
  \ hour -  brings whatever it will, but my moment now will not be wasted fretting\
  \ about that. \n\nMy only requirements during this time are to eat the com tam,\
  \ enjoy the moments and throw a hail Mary that I don\u2019t end up sick. But even\
  \ if I do, hey, that\u2019s tomorrow\u2019s problem."
