Text: "International volunteering became a sort of annual ritual with me about five\
  \ years ago after a eye-opening and exciting four weeks teaching English in Kenya.\
  \ What began as one-time, lending a hand in some small way journey became a bi-yearly\
  \ excuse to explore less ventured and more interesting places in the world with\
  \ volunteer group benefits.\n\nThe act of volunteering has cannily become equal\
  \ parts self-serving travel support as much as an opportunity to do some sort of\
  \ good in the world. As a photojournalist, I am always looking for the off-the-beaten-path\
  \ sort of destinations and usually travel in spring or fall when the climates are\
  \ more bearable and most rainy seasons are dormant. Of course, there aren\u2019\
  t the mobs of tourists and college students in the background of every shot either.\
  \ Volunteering offers me the chance to get up close and personal with different\
  \ communities of the world without feeling like one of those tourists.  And besides\
  \ the satisfaction of helping other people out \u2014 and occasionally their fellow\
  \ Hominidae (Working on an orangutan reserve in Malaysia) \u2014 it is also a great\
  \ way to get acclimated to a less developed country \u2014 namely its culture, food,\
  \ language and customs \u2014 with the help, support and guidance of a local volunteer\
  \ team and the families you get to stay with.  A one or two week crash course, so\
  \ to speak. There is nothing more intimidating or a feeling of helplessness than\
  \ being dropped off blindly into an environment way different that our western world\
  \ without a clue. Just getting used to the creature conveniences we usually take\
  \ for granted \u2014 simple amenities like hot water, air conditioning and sit-down\
  \ toilets \u2014 can take some getting used to. Those squat toilets may be more\
  \ natural and beneficial to your system (so they say), but not when your bad knees\
  \ scream at every bend like mine do. Still don\u2019t know why they don\u2019t put\
  \ handlebars around that hole in the ground. While most homestay experiences may\
  \ take you out of your comfort zone for a spell, they also offer adventurous travelers\
  \ a bartering-type opportunity to help others in exchange for getting a helping\
  \ hand in return."
