Text: "If you had Goldilocks tendencies and happened to peek inside an average house\
  \ in Karachi after midnight, you would find its inhabitants sleeping soundly on\
  \ the floor.\n \nYes, it is true: some Pakistanis sleep on floor mattresses. It\u2019\
  s not that we disown the idea of beds. It\u2019s just that we like to utilize every\
  \ spare inch in the room. And that floor with the beige carpet? It\u2019s a King\
  \ size bed. That Persian rug in the living room? It\u2019s a motherfuckin\u2019\
  \ dream factory. \n\nYou can say Pakistanis are humble since we are down to earth,\
  \ literally hugging the earth as we sleep. You can also call us sprightly, because\
  \ we just ninja-roll out of our floor beds and start our day with a cup of steaming\
  \ hot chai. \n\nThe mattress serves as our trusty treasury, the plushy safe where\
  \ we store all our hard-earned savings. Ask any petty thief hanging around in a\
  \ bush in the vicinity and he will tell you: check under the mattress first.\n\n\
  Sleeping on the floor is great for your back, I tell all my friends when they enquire\
  \ curiously about the mattresses leaning against the curtains.\n\n\u201COh, yeah?\
  \ Then why do you still have neck pain?\u201D one of them challenged my wellness\
  \ technique one day.\n\n\u201CFrom reading your endless texts about your boyfriend,\
  \ SUSAN.\u201D\n\nMuch like the scene breaks in between a play, we will rush to\
  \ clear the mattresses and linen at the sound of a ringing doorbell, the signifier\
  \ of the unexpected arrival of guests. Pillows will be thrown hastily out the window,\
  \ and bed sheets will be stored away behind armchairs. Every room is a bedroom in\
  \ a Pakistani household.\n\nThe Charpai is an extension of the mattress. A four-legged,\
  \ hand-woven, elemental feat of woodworking which functions as a table during the\
  \ day and as a bed during the night. This is where you can have a group discussion\
  \ about the merit of mangoes during lunch, and toss and turn over the price of mangoes\
  \ once night sets in.\n\nThe mobility of the Charpai comes in handy especially during\
  \ the daily power outage. We may carry the Charpai outside to the garden and sleep\
  \ under the stars, like a luxury camping experience but without marshmallows and\
  \ with better toilets.\n\nYou can also say people from Karachi have a great sense\
  \ of irony, because despite the daily power outage which renders this metropolis\
  \ into a deep darkness, we still like to call it \u201CThe City of Lights.\u201D\
  \n\nSure, you could always buy a generator, but ours got stolen in the middle of\
  \ the night. Generator theft is common, as is car radio theft, cellphone theft and\
  \ people theft. I once met a guy my age who had been kidnapped twice. Not once,\
  \ but twice. He didn\u2019t even speak about it like a war veteran, with a distant\
  \ glimmer of pain in his eye. He talked about it with the nonchalance of someone\
  \ who visits the dentist five times a year. \u201CWait - you mean you don\u2019\
  t? That\u2019s crazy.\u201D"
