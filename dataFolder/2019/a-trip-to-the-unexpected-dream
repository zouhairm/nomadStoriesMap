Text: "Living in a country made up of 17.000 islands, Indonesia, is a privilege. Thus,\
  \ exploring the eastern part of Indonesia is more than a privilege. Never thought\
  \ in my life before that I would live in Tembagapura, Papua, for work. Its law of\
  \ attraction is still a misery for me.\n\nAfter living in Papua for 8 months and\
  \ during my one-week-holiday, I got my first chance to explore other city in Papua,\
  \ Jayapura, the capital city of Papua province.  At the beginning, I was a little\
  \ bit afraid, since it was my first time exploring a new place in Papua, alone.\
  \ Many questions came to my mind as I had heard many disadvantages news about Papua.\
  \ Yes, I was nervous yet excited.\n\nFrom Tembagapura, a mining and secluded town,\
  \ where I currently live and work as a teacher, and after a three-hour-journey by\
  \ the company bus through a rocky, bumpy, and mountainous road, I arrived in Timika,\
  \ the nearest town from Tembagapura.  In the plane before take off, a local looked\
  \ confused finding his seat before finally sat next to me; a tall man with Rasta\
  \ hair style walked barefoot and wore shorts, T-Shirt and a noken (a traditional\
  \ knotted bag from root).\n\nWhile I was enjoying the view through the window, suddenly\
  \ the man, who was sitting next to me, took out his camera. He patted me without\
  \ saying a single word. He then pointed out the view with his finger and camera.\
  \ I guessed, he doesn't speak Indonesian, only his local language, which I don't\
  \ understand. From his gesture,  I figured out that he asked me to take a picture\
  \ from the window. I then took his camera, took a picture, and returned his camera\
  \ back. Nothing was said between us. Just a smile, showing our mutual understanding.\n\
  \nShortly before landing in Jayapura, the Sentani Lake view from above mesmerized\
  \ me and I was in a deep thought, thinking how grateful I was. And after around\
  \ one-hour-flight, the plane finally landed in Jayapura. I searched for my guide,\
  \ whom I made a contact with before. Suddenly, a local came towards me and introduced\
  \ himself. I finally knew that he was my guide. He then drove me to the first destination,\
  \ Sentani Lake and \"Danau Cinta\" (Love Lake). During the trip, we talked about\
  \ Papua and its development since Papua joined Indonesia in 70s. From him, I learnt\
  \ new things related to how locals think about the Indonesian government regarding\
  \ to the current development in Papua and also the history during Dutch occupation\
  \ that I didn't get during my school time. We also talked about separatism movement\
  \ in Papua. Such a meaningful trip filled of history and knowledge.\n\nJayapura\
  \ is a beautiful city, where you can find a harbor and a hill to see Jayapura from\
  \ the top. Visiting Jayapura made me realize, that Papua is actually not really\
  \ left behind compared to other cities in Indonesia. There is a mixture of traditional\
  \ and modern locals. Thus, infrastructure development is still needed to boost economy.\n\
  \nIn the following day, my guide and I drove to the border of Indonesia and Papua\
  \ New Guinea, located in Skouw. The one-hour-drive went well. A long concreted road\
  \ is surrounded by trees and the sun shined brightly. We finally arrived at the\
  \ checkpoint. My guide got off the car, gave his identity and explained our purpose.\
  \ After granted the permission, we finally arrived at the border by noon. We parked\
  \ our car before the border and then walked to the border.  It was really a hot\
  \ day and the sun left its mark on my skin.\n\nWe saw people coming in and out through\
  \ the border; two different nationalities, two same races, and two similar world.\
  \ We then went up to a hill, where we could see the Pacific Ocean lying beautifully\
  \ in front of us. The breezy wind, the blue ocean, the calm waves, the palm and\
  \ coconut trees, and the long road heading to the nearest villages in Papua New\
  \ Guinea mesmerized me. I felt as I were in Hawaii!!! \n\nAnother unexpected dream\
  \ has been reached by seeing the ocean at the eastern border of Indonesia and its\
  \ neighbor country."
