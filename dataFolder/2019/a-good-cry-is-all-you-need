Text: "I cried my first night in Japan. \n\nHere I was in the country of my dreams\
  \ 7,317 miles from home and I was crying like a lost child in a shopping mall. \
  \ I tried to tell myself it was just fatigue from the plane ride. \n\nThe truth\
  \ was that I was scared. I was scared that the six months I was planning to spend\
  \ were going to be consumed by homesickness. I was scared I was going to get lost\
  \ in the labyrinth that is the Japanese train system.  Most importantly, I was scared\
  \ I had made the wrong decision in coming to a country so different from my own.\
  \ \n\nThat night I curled up in my futon and cried myself to sleep. \n\nI came to\
  \ Japan to follow my dream that began when mom brought home a book \u201Cwritten\
  \ backwards\u201D. I was fascinated. Soon I was consuming every volume of manga\
  \ I could from my local library.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t enough.\n\nI began reading all\
  \ I could about Japan. From the intricate art of the tea ceremony to the enthusiastic\
  \ wotagei of Japanese idol fans.  I watched hours of YouTube videos about life in\
  \ Japan, from the positive to the negative. \n\nI decided to take the plunge. \n\
  \nLearning Japanese was not just something I wanted to cross off the bucket list.\
  \  I wanted to eat what the locals eat, live how they live, and dive further into\
  \ the culture.\n\nI finally found a school that had everything I was looking for.\
  \ Located in Shibuya the school had easy access to train lines and was not far from\
  \ the famous scramble crossing, where every day hundreds of people crossed the intersection.\
  \ \n\nI decided to live with a host family. What better way to apply what I would\
  \ learn at my language school than with a Japanese family? \n\nMy parents were not\
  \ quite sure what to say. They were proud that I was so determined to fulfill this\
  \ goal. At the same time, I knew they would miss me terribly. Besides our dog, who\
  \ else were they going to worry over for six months?\n\nI packed my entire life\
  \ into two suitcases. The months seemed to crawl by. Every day I was excitedly crossing\
  \ off the days until I was in Japan. Six months, then three, then time was up. \n\
  \nWhen I said goodbye to my parents it was the hardest thing I\u2019ve ever done.\
  \ But with that goodbye came an overwhelming feeling of independence. I may have\
  \ already been 18 but, in that moment, I finally felt like an adult.\n\nFlying the\
  \ sixteen hours to Japan crawled by. When I finally touched down in Narita, a representative\
  \ from the school was waiting for me. I climbed into a taxi and drove two hours\
  \ to Yokohama.\n\nMy host mom helped me with my luggage and was so sweet my anxiety\
  \ melted away. Tamai-san and I chatted in halting English as she cooked dinner.\
  \  She showed me to my room and let me to unpack.  \n\nThat\u2019s when I broke\
  \ down. All the emotions I had shoved aside came out at once. \n\nSometimes a good\
  \ cry is all you need.\n\nBy the next morning I had pushed aside all my worries\
  \ and focused on getting to school on time for orientation. \n\nI had come to Japan\
  \ for a reason and nothing was going to stop me."
