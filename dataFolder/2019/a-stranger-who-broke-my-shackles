Text: 'I was travelling the world to rediscover myself,searching my path to freedom
  & happiness but somehow shackled to my past,unable to move on.Though travelled more
  than half the world, met hundreds of people but i was unable to open invisible cuffs
  in my mind & heart.Then i met a young enthusiastic photographer Ian who was totally
  different from me except for his passion to travel, know and explore the world.
  He was so full of life, seemed humming  while admiring & taking pictures of everything
  around him.He had a sparkling attractive carefree personality though his habit of
  speaking too much sometimes irritated me.Well actually we were travelling by the
  same bus from Agra to Jaisalmer.We have both came to see this wonder of the world
  Taj Mahal.We both were sitting beside each other not talking except for a slight
  smile we gave each other from time to time whenever our eyes met. Actually Ian already
  saw me not in a good mood at Taj so he thought it''s better not to say anything
  but forced by his talktive habit Ian just said "isn''t Taj Mahal a true beauty a
  flawless one, I find it''s a true masterpiece of love" to which a heartbroken &
  depressed me said "well I don''t find anything so special after all its a grave
  of two lovers".Listening to my sad answer he said "atleast you said lovers,no matter
  grave but where there''s love things become special, trust me dear it''s special
  magnificent incredible". His words had deep meaning that definitely touched me but
  I pretended as if I did not like what he spoke and just to ignore him I started
  fiddling with my cell phone. It''s was a long tiring journey with two stops for
  refreshments & we finally reached Jaisalmer - the golden city of India.As we entered
  I could see sand & dunes all over with camels grazing the little bushes of grass
  in vast lands.The scenic beauty, the breeze, the bright golden sun, the ocean of
  sand all was amazing but inspite of this beautiful painting of God I was lost in
  my own thoughts when I suddenly came back to the present by Ian''s funny shout "look
  look camel with his family, mom dad & a cute baby camel" after saying this he started
  taking pictures. He had taken pictures throughout the journey but the shine i saw
  while taking this pic was uncompared to all the previous ones.I smiled at him back
  and said "wow what a sweet family".

  I din''t wanted to be rude this time.I asked him to show me all the pics he''s taken
  during this journey. He gave me his camera & showed me how to roll it back to see
  all the previous pics and started looking outside the bus window as if there was
  some treasure outside. Anyways I dint pay much attention to his eccentric action
  & kept on rolling the cam.All pics were awesome,I realized he was undoubtedly a
  wonderful photographer.Two of last pics were of him, a girl & a child, I presumed
  his wife & son, pics were sweet, I complimented him for all the pics he took on
  the way, especially for his sweet family photograph & said it would have been great
  if they would have also come.He thanked me & said "I wish I could bring them along
  & show them the beauty of this world but ma''am they both are in a much more beautiful
  & a brighter place,i lost them last year in a road accident".After hearing this
  I was in a state of shock,couldn''t understand how could he be so full of life after
  such loss.I said sorry to which he said "please don''t be, I believe they are with
  me always, as I said where there''s love everything is special,all my travels are
  special because I know in every journey they are with me, there love is with me
  & that''s why I try to capture each & every moment". I smiled back at him, felt
  a connection, a connection of pain & emotions.I patted his shoulder & said let''s
  see & capture this beautiful sand, sun & breeze together my friend.He''s back to
  chicago but we are still in touch,we message,mail & talk on phone to each other
  sharing our travel stories.'
