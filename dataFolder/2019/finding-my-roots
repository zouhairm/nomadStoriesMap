Text: My parents never discussed their upbringing on the Azores Islands expect they
  met in the US  and ended up owning a Small Dairy Farm in the the central valley
  of Ca.  After their passing decided in my late 30's to adventure to Portugal and
  find my way to the Azores. I  headed to Sao Jorge My Dads Island via a freighter
  boat from Fail.  Landing with a beard and backpack headed into the village and stopeed
  at a market to inquire about my dads name.  He pointed me down the street and walking
  along came across a women riding on a donkey with her husband and son walking along
  side. In broken Portugese asked where pops house was.  They pointed down the street
  and said there would no place to stay and invited me to their house.  They turned
  out to be wonderful hosts and thought would any one in the US have picked up a stranger
  looking lime me to stay at their home Don't think so. They were right, my Aunt lived
  there the other that the bedroom with wood floors all the rest were dirt.  Cooking
  was wood counter with holes with a fire burning underneath. I cried but left so
  humble to find such wonderful people who treated me so special and I found part
  of my roots!
