Text: "My knees cracked as I stooped to tie my bootlace. Hours of cutting west across\
  \ I-90 had stiffened my joins. My hips ached, my shoulders were hiked to my ears,\
  \ and there was a permanent cramp in my right ankle from holding pressure on the\
  \ gas pedal--the 1994 Volvo Wagon did not have cruise control.\n\n\tMy friend reached\
  \ into my jacket pocket for the car keys. \u201CFeeling any better?\u201D \n\n\t\
  The night before, we had breached the arid regions of Washington state, crossing\
  \ the North Cascades. It was Colville National Forest, a seemingly endless wilderness,\
  \ that had presented us with the greatest challenges of the road trip thus far.\
  \ Maneuvering around sharp curves on mountain roads in the dark, a thick fog had\
  \ enveloped our car, and a high fever had gripped me tight. \n\nI remembered little\
  \ of the drive--just my friend glancing over her shoulder every now and then to\
  \ check on me as I lay under the blankets in the back. She muttered to herself about\
  \ the fog and leaned forward in her seat. Apprehension filled the vehicle like murky\
  \ water. \n\nWe powered through the National Forest, unaware at that time that we\
  \ could have pulled off on a side road and camped for free. The next morning, I\
  \ woke outside of a decrepit playground to the sound of swings squeaking aimless\
  \ in the wind. A cold grey morning, the hallmark of the Pacific Northwest. My friend\
  \ was already up and preparing porridge and tea on a picnic table. \n\nA road trip\
  \ is the best kind of trip for people who want to save money. As college students\
  \ on a tight budget, we slept at rest stops or campsites in National Parks, and\
  \ we went days without showering. Our meals consisted of boiled eggs, cheese, ramen,\
  \ oatmeal, and peanut butter sandwiches. Like many of the Pacific Northwest's wanderers\
  \ and van-lifers, we occasionally woke to a cop knocking on the car window asking\
  \ us to move on. \nAs my friend and I continued through the PNW, we stopped at charming\
  \ towns along the coast where we sampled pastries, art markets, and craft beers.\
  \ But it was always the land that called to us. We could park by a beach and fall\
  \ asleep to the crashing of waves.\n\nThe Pacific Northwest is a landscape of change.\
  \ It is at once quiet as it is clamouring. The nature here is deafening, and it\
  \ seems to gobble up everything from the landscape to the lifestyle. Wherever you\
  \ stop, someone can recommend a great hike or tell you the best place to buy farm\
  \ fresh fruit and honey. The mosses devour the stones, the ocean siphons rivers.\
  \ Everything is sensory. There is the ocean, the forests, the waterfalls, the caves,\
  \ the mountains. Here, you see that the world truly is spun of color. You get a\
  \ sense of the raw power of the earth.\n\nWe were reminded of this in the Three\
  \ Sisters Wilderness Area in Oregon. After picking up pink cherries and blackberries\
  \ at a farmer\u2019s market, we drove up a mountain road. We planned routes with\
  \ a single second-hand map of the US. \n\nI spread the crinkled sheet across my\
  \ lap. The blackberries dripped and stained Nevada. \u201CJust keep following this\
  \ road,\u201D I said as I handed her a handful of cherries. I stuck my hand out\
  \ the window, braiding ribbons of mountain air. Trees flashed green and brown around\
  \ us.\n\nSuddenly, nothing.\n\nWe were in the sunlight. All at once on this mountain,\
  \ the trees has dropped away. We found ourselves in a wide, black field of jagged\
  \ volcanic rock. We exchanged a look and couldn\u2019t help but laugh, the kind\
  \ of laughter that ripened the face. \n\nWe stopped to marvel at the formations,\
  \ the blackness. I touched the rocks, sharp enough to cut. Ancient white trees jutted\
  \ out from the old lava like bones. \n\nAll of this made me feel so small. \n\n\
  My friend placed a hand on my shoulder. We shared a breathless smile. My body settled\
  \ like a cloud against a mountain peak. \n\nSo this, I thought, is what love is.\
  \ It is beautiful and raw. It is fruitful, it is destructive."
