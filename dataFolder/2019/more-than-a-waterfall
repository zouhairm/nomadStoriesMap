Text: "I am a South African and I live in one of the 9 provinces of South Africa,\
  \ which is in Mpumalanga .Since I was young I have always heard or known that Mpumalanga\
  \ is one of the top places to visit in Mpumalanga. \n\nWhen I found out that  I\
  \ am in love with traveling, I decided to pursue my passion and Mpumalanga was the\
  \ first place I started at since its my home province hence MAKING A LOCAL CONNECTION.\n\
  I had already visited  most of the Game reserve and parks in mpumalanga, even the\
  \ big one Kruger national park. I wanted something different along the lines of\
  \ swimming or wayer diving BUT in South Africa its a well known fact that beaches\
  \ are found in only 3 provinces and mpumalanga is not one of them.\n\nNo need to\
  \ worry, there is a way of spending your holiday in mpumalanga underwater or on\
  \ top of it . I am not talking about taking a swim in the swimming pool, but am\
  \ talking about taking a swim or a dive in a different pool i.e a waterfall, YES\
  \ a waterfall. Mpumalanga is known to have some of the best waterfalls in Africa\
  \ and up there with the best in world.\n\nTo cut my story short, I decided  to take\
  \ a one day tour to the Mac mac falls in the Sabie town of  Mpumalanga province.\
  \ \nI drove all the way from my home town\nBarberton which is +_3hours to Sabie.\
  \ Before this trip I had only seen waterfalls on the big screen TV, it was time\
  \ I see waterfalls live.\n\nThe road to Sabie is a mountainous and green scenery\
  \ view, it was a beautiful site to see. Just after a 3 hours drive I arrived at\
  \ Sabie town and drive through outside of the town up north. Finding Mac mac falls\
  \ was easy because of the many signs scattered around the town directing a tourist\
  \ to different attractions of the town. Traffic is not big on the road leading to\
  \ the Mac mac falls. From town (Sabie) to the waterfalls it only took a 20 minutes\
  \ drive and then I was there.\n\nUpon arriving at the gate, I had to pay a small\
  \ admission  fee  and was given a day pass. I had to leave my car at the parking\
  \ lot. From the parking lot  tourists walk to the  Mac mac falls, along the short\
  \ walk, there are stalls selling handmade craft in the entrance. Moving along from\
  \ the stalls there is a pathway leading to boardwalks which leads to the waterfalls.\
  \ Unfortunately the waterfalls are long and therefore  are FENCED around tourists\
  \ cant reach them, they only have to watch them from the top, no swimming in them.\n\
  \nWhen I first laid my eyes on the waterfalls, I was in awe of the nature's beauty\
  \ it was the first time seeing something beautiful which\ncant be described  in\
  \ words. The waterfalls were falling from 70metres, making a beautiful pool of \
  \ water underneath. I felt a bit of regret that I only know this place now when\
  \ I am all grown up, I felt I missed out and no amount of visiting this place will\
  \ make up for the lost time. I vowed right there, that I will let the world know\
  \ about this waterfalls through my writing about my joys of seeing the waterfalls\
  \ for the first time. I after spending  an hour taking pictures and taking in the\
  \ peacefulness of the waterfalls, it wad time to move along to the nearby Mac mac\
  \ pools for swimming.  \n\nThe Mac mac pools are 3minutes drive from the Mac mac\
  \ falls. I arrived at the Mac mac pools while it was still hot, therefore a swim\
  \ was needed. The Mac mac pools did not disappoint either, from afar a big waterfall\
  \ falling onto the big pool can be seen. When I arrived the was a shallow pool,\
  \ where lot of people were swimming down to the small pools where  water reached\
  \ at knee length.\nThe water was warm from the big to the small pools. After swimming\
  \ it was time to drive back. I had fun.\n\nI encountered more than a waterfall ."
