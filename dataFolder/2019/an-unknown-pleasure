Text: "I arrive in Sacramento, California. It is nearing 11:30am. We arrive on a tour\
  \ bus, which I spend the majority of my year living on with twelve other people.\
  \ We pull up to a nice hotel with lush beds, chic bathrooms and accommodations that\
  \ could seem unnecessary to some with a broader perspective of comfort. However,\
  \ This is not why I am excited. I hurry into my hotel room, drop my luggage and\
  \ fill a smaller duffel and a backpack and head right out the door. I had a plan,\
  \ an arrangement, an adventure on the horizon. I call a colleague of mine who was\
  \ to accompany me on this journey. No answer. I wait thirty minutes, and still no\
  \ answer. \n   Now I am contemplating doing this solo. I wanted to bail as well,\
  \ I got nervous. I forced myself to go pick up a rental car, and drive east right\
  \ out of the bay area, all the way east until I found myself three hours out in\
  \ the small town of Mariposa, California. Mariposa County is home to none other\
  \ than Yosemite National Park. Yosemite is known for many things, from some of the\
  \ most breathtaking panoramas in the world, wildlife that is truly abundant, rivers\
  \ and waterfalls that are clear as can be, solid granite walls towering thousands\
  \ of feet overhead and a deep rooted rock climbing culture where athletes push to\
  \ the very edge of human capabilities. I was never going to bail, I needed to be\
  \ here. I stay in the small town of Mariposa which is about an hours drive into\
  \ Yosemite Valley and mingle with some locals from a wide range of cultural background.\n\
  \    I wake up the following morning about 7:30am and its go time! I set off for\
  \ the Valley. I approach a ranger booth where I paid my entry fee, and proceeded\
  \ into the park. Driving down winding roads as the sun breaks through the canopy,\
  \ I cant wait for that first glimpse. The surrounding forest finally breaks and\
  \ El Capitan is directly on my left. My jaw dropped, I was speechless. Golden fields\
  \ lay on the valley floor as the granite giants sit proud above. I make my way to\
  \ the car park and grabbed a turkey and cheese sandwich for the hikes. I set off\
  \ hiking the Mirror lake trail. The air is so crisp, slightly cold with a tinge\
  \ of pine that seemed to never fade. I encounter my first sign of wildlife on this\
  \ path. I spent time watching a buck that had been grazing on the spoils of the\
  \ valley. He starts to approach, and my heartbeat quickens. About fifteen feet from\
  \ me, He stands in the light. I slowly step back. The buck crosses my path and goes\
  \ on his way. I finish the trail and head on the trolley to the Half dome Trail.\
  \ \n   I was not going to Half Dome since a permit is required to summit the giant.\
  \ However, there are many other landscaped to appreciate along the way to the base\
  \ camp. I am hiking up rather steep inclines on a sturdy path. The further you go,\
  \ the less sturdy the trail becomes. I reach the base of Vernal Falls about an hour\
  \ and a half in. There are rocks sitting atop some grass about mid way up the falls.\
  \ I hike up to these rocks for a clearer view. As I reach them, I watch the water\
  \ cascade off the granite ledge and crash down into the pool below. The mist in\
  \ the air causes a rainbow that is constantly shimmering in front of the tan colored\
  \ wall. I enjoy that turkey sandwich here sitting on a rock with no company other\
  \ than my thoughts. I make my way up the the top of the falls, The Emerald pool\
  \ is what its called. I walk out on a group of rocks that lead towards the center\
  \ of the pool and as I gaze into the crystal clear water, a smile runs across my\
  \ face as I look forward for whats to become of the evening ahead."
