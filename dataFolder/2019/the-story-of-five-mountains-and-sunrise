Text: "There were six seats, and none of mine. Then suddenly, I got call to join the\
  \ 'sunrise hunter' trip. \n\nMe and my coworkers went to Posong, Temanggung, Central\
  \ Java, we need more than two hours to get there from my city, Yogyakarta by car.\n\
  \nOn the street, I asked to myself, \"What does make sunrise in Posong being so\
  \ special?\" I thought the sunrise will be as beautiful as in the beaches or hills.\
  \ But in fact, I am wrong.\n\nWe departed at 10 P.M. We passed through bright city\
  \ roads to the dark countryside that full of lush trees. We stopped once to get\
  \ some midnight snacks. At 1.30 A.M. we arrived at Wati's house. She is a villager\
  \ and owner of coffee grounds around Mt. Sindara. She allowed us to sleep in her\
  \ house.\n\nThen we started to go to Posong at 4.30 A.M. Posong is just 15 minutes\
  \ from Wati's house.\n\nWe passed rough and rocky village street to get there. Around\
  \ us, there are many coffee, vegetables, and tobacco fields. You might see the silhouette\
  \ of Mt. Sindara, although it was not really clear.\n\nAt Posong, we should hike\
  \ 35-50 meters to get perfect pictures of sunrise. It was not really high. \n\n\
  We found our spot and waited for the sun. The purplish tinge, slowly moved into\
  \ orange. While slowly changing, i could see the summits, not only one or two, but\
  \ five mountains in Central Java.\n\nI barely believed the sun illuminates the summit\
  \ of Mt. Merapi, Merbabu, Andong, Telemoyo, and Sumbing which was sturdy right in\
  \ front of me. You also could see Mt. Ungaran although at that time it was covered\
  \ by fog. Then when I turned back, i could see Mt. Sindara surrounded by vegetables\
  \ field.\n\nThere are at least 18 mountains in Central Java, and from Posong, you\
  \ can enjoy seven of them. \n\nIf I may give you suggestion, don't forget to bring\
  \ your jacket and shoes. You need jacket because Posong is highland, when we arrived\
  \ the temperature was around 11-12 Celsius degrees. But when the sun goes up, you\
  \ can take off your jacket.\n\nYou also need shoes because the street in Posong\
  \ is rocky. You do not need to bring food because there are many local people serve\
  \ simple food and hot drinks.\n\nThe coffee in Posong is very famous. Wati explained\
  \ to us that the coffee here is planted close to tobacco, therefore the nicotine\
  \ contained in the coffee is stronger. That is why, she said the coffee from Mt.\
  \ Sindara is the best."
