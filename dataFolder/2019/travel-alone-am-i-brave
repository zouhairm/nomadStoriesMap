Text: "\"Don't ever think you're extraordinary,\" I would tell every solo traveller.\n\
  \nCarrying a 25 pounds backpack alone wandering in a foreign land with strangers\
  \ passing by sounds pretty romantic, like a libertine. At least that's how Alexander\
  \ Supertramp portraited in Into the Wild. But in reality, it's much less romantic\
  \ than it sounds. Honestly, there's nothing special about travelling alone. There're\
  \ thousand ways to travel, and doing that alone is simply a choice of preference.\n\
  \n\"Damn girl you're brave! I wish I could have the courage to do that.\"\n\"No\
  \ I'm really not.\"\n\"Shut up, you are.\"\n\nI'm kinda tired of hearing comments\
  \ like \"it's so brave of you to travel alone.\" Uh-ah, no, I am not. I've never\
  \ considered myself as the brave kind, sometimes I even dare not to talk back to\
  \ my father. I chose to travel alone because I don't like drama, because I like\
  \ being quiet, because I hate to be restricted, because from time to time I don't\
  \ want to make compromise. I am stubborn, and I know that, so I'd rather go by myself.\
  \ And of course, having time by yourself is never a bad idea. None of these have\
  \ anything to do with bravery.  \n\nTravelling alone is actually a very common thing.\
  \ People do it everywhere. 80% of the people staying in hostels are solo traveller.\
  \ Their footprints can be found in every corner, they make friends from Arctic to\
  \ Antarctica. If you still think it's absurd, think of these people like the baby\
  \ birds that are being pushed from trees by their eagle parents. They learn to fly\
  \ by actually attempting to fly. \n \nIf I have to be honest with you, travelling\
  \ alone is in itself lonely.\n\nIt might be exciting and carefree in the first few\
  \ days, but the feelings wear off with time. With all the goodbye you say to all\
  \ the people you meet on the way, you are going to feel empty inside. Not gonna\
  \ lie, sometimes I would want to have someone besides me, to share my journey and\
  \ the views alongside. Then I turned around, there's no one.\n\nSo is travelling\
  \ alone particularly charming? No. Not a bit. When alone, you are more likely to\
  \ notice how happy people are surrounded by friends and family, you're prone to\
  \ be lonely. You'd feel homesick and sometimes you would feel tired of keep going.\
  \ You'll get lost alone, eat alone, and say goodbye to yourself alone. And is travelling\
  \ alone an achievement to be bragged about? Nah, they won't tell you all the stupid\
  \ and humiliating things they have encountered or done. \n\nBut take the leap, not\
  \ of faith but of curiosity, for the world is full of surprises and knowledge waiting\
  \ to pass on. Don't do it so as to be special, do it for your soul so as to fill\
  \ it with amaze. Be humble about it and be ready to be humbled by all the new experiences\
  \ and people you're going to go through. \n\nDon't go into the journey thinking\
  \ glory puts a halo above you. There's no point to fantasise about solo travelling.\
  \ It's not a symbol of bravery. Really, it's just a choice. You can do it too."
