Text: "To start the story off,  we were staying in a super cool Riad, which is a Moroccan\
  \ style hostel. The people who worked there were super friendly and were recommending\
  \ different excursions for us to do to make the most out of our Moroccan experience.\
  \ This, my friends, is how we learned about this Hammam. Now there are two different\
  \ types of Hammams in Morocco. The first type is the local Hammam, which all the\
  \ locals go to. We went to the second type, which is a professional Hammam, in a\
  \ spa type atmosphere. \nOur wonderful hostel lady walked us to the Hammam, which\
  \ looked like a little hole in the wall but, once inside, was a nice little spa.\
  \ Savannah and I decided to do a package deal where we got the traditional Hammam\
  \ with a massage at the end. I think it's safe to say that we actually had NO idea\
  \ what we were getting into. \nThey started by taking us into a little changing\
  \ room, where they gave us a locker to put our stuff in, and the items we needed\
  \ for the Hammam. These items were croc type shoes, a big scrub type glove, and\
  \ a little pair of undies, and that's it.  Now when I say undies, I bet you're picturing\
  \ actual underwear, but you couldn't be more wrong. These \"undies\" were an elastic\
  \ waist with a skinny rectangle cloth in the middle. \nSo we put those on (literally\
  \ those were the only things we had on) and, giggling nervously, shuffled into the\
  \ next room. When we heard the word bath, we pictured a pool of water of some sort.\
  \ Nope. The next room was a sauna with two benches in it. We sat awkwardly on the\
  \ benches, wondering what we had gotten ourselves into.\nThis is where things started\
  \ to get interesting. A lady entered and turned on a faucet of water which poured\
  \ into a little plastic tub. She took two buckets, filled them up with water, and\
  \ started pouring them all over us. She then lotioned us up from head to toe, back\
  \ to front, and left us to stew in our own juices for about 20 minutes. The weather\
  \ in Morocco was in between 95-100 degrees, so you can only imagine how hot it was.\
  \  When we thought we would melt into a pile of sweat, the lady came back in to\
  \ pour water all over us a second time and quickly left again. We laid uncomfortably\
  \ for some time again until she came back for scrubbing time. She put on the scrub\
  \ glove and went to town, exfoliating each centimeter of skin she could get to.\
  \ This wasn't a nice gentle exfoliation. I was nervous that I was going to look\
  \ down and see my skin scrubbed to pieces. She gave us another drenching to wash\
  \ off the scrub and bits of dead skin that now covered us and moved on to our hair.\
  \ \n After washing and braiding our hair, she left YET AGAIN to let us simmer for\
  \ a good bit. When she finally returned to give us our final bucket pouring, we\
  \ had probably sweated out a good five pounds. She poured the most refreshing cool\
  \ water over us, getting off whatever lotion and oils were left, being very thorough.\
  \ She even lifted up my boobs to make sure there wasn't anything hiding in any nooks\
  \ or crannies. We shuffled once again to the changing room, where we were dressed\
  \ in robes, and let out to wait for our massages, which were much less eventful.\
  \ After it was all over, we stepped back onto the streets of Marrakech, our skin\
  \ glistening and softer than a baby's bottom."
