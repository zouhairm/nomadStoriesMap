Text: "The last time I was in Saigon, I was 19 and one of the only things I remember\
  \ is my aunt\u2019s friend Maurizio (an Italian veterinarian who specializes in\
  \ camels or more specifically, the fleas found on camels\u2026.), smuggling rare\
  \ turtles back to Cambodia in his underpants. \_We bought them at the pet market\
  \ and he kept them in the safe of the hotel overnight. \_He was able to get them\
  \ back to his pond in Phnom Penh with no problem. \_Today that would never happen.\
  \ \_He would for sure be thrown into jail for smuggling or would have to pay a hefty\
  \ fine/bribe. \_Although, knowing Mauricio he probably would be able to talk his\
  \ way out of it. \_To say he is a character is an understatement.\n\nThis trip I\
  \ have been stunned by how much the city has changed. \_It is almost unrecognizable\
  \ from what it was in the 90s. \_Now I can understand how my parents feel when they\
  \ go back to places that they haven't seen in decades. \_It also makes me feel like\
  \ a crotchety old lady and that I should be saying things like, \"When I was young,\
  \ there weren't so many cars or tall buildings... \_Can you believe how expensive\
  \ things are now? \_Last time I was here I could buy a chicken for a dollar.\"\n\
  \nCrossing the street is still overwhelming but now there are more cars, not just\
  \ scooters, hurtling in your general vicinity. \_Getting from one side to the other\
  \ was like an exercise in zen meditation. \_Empty your head and keep moving. \_\
  Don't look at what is zooming towards you, just focus on getting to the other side\
  \ of the street, they will avoid you. \_For the most part this worked until I went\
  \ to visit a friend's family in another district and thought for sure I was going\
  \ to die. \_I felt like no one was trying to avoid me but instead they were gunning\
  \ for me. \_My friend's cousin had to stop in the middle of the street with his\
  \ hand up and usher me across. \_The confidence that I had acquired and the effort\
  \ to not look like a stupid tourist when I crossed the street disappeared instantly.\
  \ \_Fortunately when I returned to District 1 my zen attitude came back pretty quickly.\
  \ \_Maybe they are more used to tourists and understand that we can be like wild\
  \ animals, skittish and unpredictable.  Being on the back of a scooter is way less\
  \ stressful than being on foot. \_You really get a sense of how the traffic works\
  \ and why it works. \_Yes, everyone honks but no one slams on the brakes or seems\
  \ to have road rage. \_It is also amazing what people carry on their bikes - shop\
  \ signs, building materials, luggage, multiple children, dogs... \_And it really\
  \ does work.\n\nAs always, my favorite part of the trip was the food. \_Even in\
  \ B\u1EBFn Th\xE0nh market which is known for being a tourist mecca the food was\
  \ simple and delicious. \_I truly believe that it is hard to get a bad meal in Vietnam.\
  \ \_Fortunately, most dishes are pretty healthy so I didn't feel like I needed to\
  \ buy new pants to make up for overeating. \_The highlight was a homemade meal with\
  \ a friend's family and that was by far the best food we ate. \_Nothing else compared\
  \ after that. \_It was one of those meals where you leave the table in pain because\
  \ you stuffed so much in. \_Not only because it was amazingly good but because you\
  \ didn't want to seem rude by not eating enough. Unfortunately, my Vietnamese accent\
  \ is terrible. \_When I tried to say thank you, I was told that if I didn't do it\
  \ right I would either be saying \"orange\" or \"shut your mouth.\" I stuck to English\
  \ after that...\n\nThanks to my friend's family and the miles of walking I did,\
  \ I felt like I was able to see behind the scenes of Saigon and because of that,\
  \ build a deeper connection to the city.  I can't wait to see how it changes and\
  \ evolves between now and my next visit.  There definitely will be a next one."
