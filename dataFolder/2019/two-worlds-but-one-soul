Text: "I traced the smooth surface of this precious layer of fabric. Had my life have\
  \ been as smooth as this silky Batik, I wouldn\u2019t have travelled to this small\
  \ town in Central Java, Solo. As my eyes glued to the harmonious blend of blue and\
  \ purple surreal clouds, forming the pattern of Mega Mendung, my mind wandered to\
  \ somewhere else.\n\n\u201CYou get that tan skin from your mother. Your mother is\
  \ wicked, don\u2019t grow up to be like her. You don\u2019t want to be \u201Cpribumi\u201D\
  \ like her, right?\u201D My Chinese family said to me once when I was younger, after\
  \ my mom ran away with other Javanese man.\n\nOr that moment.\n\n\u201CYour father\
  \ is a good man. But his family is not. You know that when we tried to visit you,\
  \ brought you some grapes that you like, and they threw it away just like that.\
  \ They acted all mighty when they are not. You are a Javanese, remember that.\u201D\
  \ This time, my Javanese family said to me.\n\nI was torn between two worlds.\n\n\
  The two worlds that collided so severely, so mercilessly. I was a wanderer for a\
  \ long time. I was trying to find my true identity right after I stepped into the\
  \ adulthood. Their remarks, time over time, was built into something that I couldn\u2019\
  t no longer handle. I had no idea who I am. I didn\u2019t belong to Chinese. My\
  \ skin is tan, my eyes are huge, and I can\u2019t speak any Mandarin. I was surely\
  \ not a Javanese either. The language sounded alien to me, the food I didn\u2019\
  t like, and I hated my mom with all my might. I didn\u2019t want to be perceived\
  \ as a \u201Cpribumi\u201D like her, at that time.\n\nAnd that the tragedy of 1998\
  \ happened.\n\nI was 7 years old back then. It scared me to the bone. School had\
  \ us go home earlier. I was with my Chinese family at that time as my father had\
  \ my custody. We were in silence, while outside the riot broke. Watching TVs to\
  \ monitor the situation didn\u2019t turn out well. It got us even more afraid and\
  \ helpless. Later I knew that most of my friends\u2019 business were looted by the\
  \ other people, their homes were robbed, their lives were destroyed. The Chinese\
  \ people who had money were fleeing to Singapore and Malaysia, while the rest stayed,\
  \ facing the anger of the people. The scars torn so deep, even until today.\n\n\
  It worsened the situation between Chinese and Javanese people. Their hatred became\
  \ all the more hostile, like the water which reached its boiling point. And I was\
  \ trapped between the two ends.\n\nAs the subtle hint of sandalwood tickled my olfactory,\
  \ my senses came to me. My attention went back to this beautiful masterpiece of\
  \ silky Batik. I was struck. It was a silk fabric with the pattern of Batik. Silk,\
  \ which was widely known originated from Chinese people, with the pattern of Mega\
  \ Mendung Batik. I gazed upon the label on the fabric shelf. This pattern was from\
  \ Cirebon and that it was assimilated by the people in Cirebon and Chinese as the\
  \ Silk Road was opened.\n\nI glanced around this rustic small shop and found another\
  \ anomaly. I heard the thick-accent of Javanese coming out of a group of Chinese\
  \ Indonesian people. I noticed the smell of \u201Chio\u201D or incense and found\
  \ it in the corner, along with the worship table. Yet on another table, \u201Ckeris\u201D\
  \ or authentic Javanese blade and \u201Cwayang\u201D or Javanese puppet were stacked\
  \ up neatly. All of them belonged here.\n\nI was crying silently. I was relieved.\n\
  \nLittle did I know, on that one fine Saturday evening, I came to realize that I\
  \ was made up from two worlds. I didn\u2019t need to choose between worlds. I had\
  \ one soul, which was in a dazzling mixture of Chinese and Javanese, brewed perfectly.\
  \ And because of that, I could empathise with either people. I knew how it felt\
  \ to be Chinese, and I surely understood how it felt to be Javanese.\n\nThat silky\
  \ Mega Mendung changed the course of my life. That shop helped me to realise that\
  \ I was complete. Since I was born."
