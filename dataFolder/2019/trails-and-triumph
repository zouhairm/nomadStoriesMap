Text: "We won\u2019t make it. Approaching the mountain pass at a cautious pace, a\
  \ flurry of snowflakes disperse; soft crystalline missiles foiled by an impenetrable\
  \ wall of moving steel and glass. Driving the pass was at best, precarious. \n\n\
  It was never going to be an average holiday. Fitness the goal, travel the reward.\
  \ An opportunity to harness the majesty of New Zealand\u2019s vast mountain landscape\
  \ to inspire months of training for a destination race; an excuse to travel and\
  \ take a leap into the unknown. The Queenstown Marathon does boast, after all, to\
  \ have the most beautiful course in the world. \n\nNew Zealand\u2019s South Island\
  \ impresses even the most seasoned traveller. Gargantuan v-shaped mountains rise\
  \ from pristine lakes on a scale that inspires and humbles. Alpine melts flow across\
  \ ancient Greywacke ranges coursing into turquoise waterways, themselves formed\
  \ millions of years ago by glacial movements. Idyllic landscapes host time-worn\
  \ gold rush villages, robust stone farms, and award-winning wineries. It\u2019s\
  \ no wonder this region has diverse appeal, attracting adrenaline junkies, artists\
  \ and foodies alike.  \n\nAt 4am the alarm sounds in the lakeside town of Wanaka.\
  \ It\u2019s race day. Torrents of rain and wind buffeted the region in the last\
  \ 24 hours, ceasing only in the early hours of morning. The Crown Range Road to\
  \ Queenstown is damp and slippery for those travelling pre-dawn. Temperatures hover\
  \ around zero, and black ice threatens to close the mountain overpass. At 1121m\
  \ above sea level, the pass is the highest main road in New Zealand and is frequently\
  \ closed in treacherous conditions. We drive past the snow tussock corridor and\
  \ the old gold rush town of Cardrona. Concentrating at every turn, the headlights\
  \ reveal increasingly dramatic topography rising from the darkness as the road twists\
  \ through the landscape like a gymnast\u2019s ribbon. Thankfully, we encounter no\
  \ ice, and twenty-five minutes later we are travelling down picturesque country\
  \ lanes towards Speargrass Flat. \n\nThe dawn twilight cloaks the meeting point\
  \ blue hues, a thick blanket of frost crisp underfoot. Emerging from the car, my\
  \ breath instantly forms a white mist, betraying nerves within. What at times indulgent\
  \ and lonely destination travel goal, is now shared with a community of likeminded\
  \ locals and travellers from across the globe. Nerves make way for shivering exchanges\
  \ and excited conversations, as the sun peaks over the surrounding mountain range\
  \ illuminating the rural scene with rays of gold. Mesmerised, locals and visitors\
  \ alike pause to appreciate the beauty of nature and soak up the emerging warmth\
  \ of dawn. \n\nI meet strangers- increasingly feeling more like comrades, who also\
  \ run solo. We warm up and head to the start line, swapping stories of motivation,\
  \ challenge, and goals. Many are locals, but there are also participants from Hong\
  \ Kong, Singapore, USA, Europe and Australia. Some plan to run more destination\
  \ races around the world. Others just want to finish. The field is as diverse as\
  \ it is inspiring. \n\nWe race. The symphony of pounding feet helps focus my own.\
  \ The usually serene tree-lined lane is damp with retiring mist. Colourful runners\
  \ dot the road as distant mountain views hint at more beauty ahead. The pace settles,\
  \ allowing my gaze to extend beyond tall Hawthorn hedgerows into the affluent, still\
  \ sleepy worlds of private rural estates. The trail winds and narrows, and soon\
  \ meanders beside the turquoise Kawarau river, a hub of outdoor activity. We cross\
  \ the Shotover. Live bands and locals lend a supportive festival vibe and the weather\
  \ is sunny and warm. There is still some way to go. I revel in the distractions,\
  \ soaking up the sights, sounds, and experiences I otherwise would not have had\
  \ on holiday, and thank my legs for months of effort. \n\nThe road is closed. Snowflakes\
  \ fall, thick in the air. Glancing at my medal, I reflect on the race completed\
  \ just 24 hours earlier. A glorious day of sunshine between rain and snow, where\
  \ effort and perseverance were celebrated by locals and travellers together, in\
  \ a destination worthy of the hype. Today, it doesn\u2019t matter if we make it\
  \ through the pass. There is no finish line to cross, no medals to win. Just experiences\
  \ to enjoy, and time to linger with new friends."
