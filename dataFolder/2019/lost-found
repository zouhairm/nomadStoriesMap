Text: "San Diego, California, USA. I\u2019ve never expected to get that far, from\
  \ Morocco to France to finally step in the farest unknown.\nThe country is lacking\
  \ story they said but every person, connection, discussion is making yours, shaping\
  \ you and getting you closer to your life and spirit goal. \nThis part of the country\
  \ is Lucifer secret place, where he lost his wings, where he takes vacations giving\
  \ us a short image of hell and heaven, where the lights are turned off to make us\
  \ value the light, let it out and be that light out. \nLos Angeles, angels that\
  \ are looking for themselves, loosing themselves to humanity, empathy but also to\
  \ vices that are the royal road to success. \nThere, I missed humanity the way always\
  \ defined it and knew it, but then, it made me loose my repairs, to understand that\
  \ destruction is the last step of the cycle that allows the creation of a new one.\
  \ \nIve discovered kindness in the eyes of an old woman, the love she couldn\u2019\
  t express to her daughter, fear in the most crual ones, hesitation in the most ambitious\
  \ ones but courage and a will to survive and fight. Fight for the goodness and empathy\
  \ lost between individualism, the continuous race created by these snaps of life\
  \ that we write as our story."
