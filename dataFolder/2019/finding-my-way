Text: "Years and years of exploring, i find myself sitting in front of my laptop,\
  \ thinking to myself: 'What is it that i want to do with my life?'\n\nAfter a long\
  \ pause, i look at my web browser history. Tons and tons of travel blogs and websites\
  \ appear in front of me. It was then and there that i realise what i have always\
  \ wanted.\n\nI love travelling! It has always been my dream to travel the whole\
  \ world as much as i can within my means. I have travel with my family and friends\
  \ many times over the last few years. However, i have yet to do any solo travel\
  \ myself. \n\nNow don't get me wrong. I love my family and friends, i really do!\
  \ But, i really love the idea of flying out on my own and doing things on my own\
  \ without having to think about others; about what they would like to do, what they\
  \ want to eat and whether they are tired or not. I have always been the travel planner\
  \ among my family and friends. \n\nHowever just this once, i would really want to\
  \ do things my way, enjoy things at my own pace without having to worry for others.\
  \ Hence, on my birthday last year, i immediately leap into the idea of booking my\
  \ first solo flight and travel to London and Bergen for March this year. I wanted\
  \ this trip to be one that i could discover myself more and treat myself better\
  \ and hopefully this will be one of the most memorable and best trip i have ever\
  \ taken.\n\nAs i'm counting down to this upcoming solo trip which happens in about\
  \ less than 30 days, i am feeling both nervous and excited at the same time. Hopefully\
  \ when i am back from the trip, i will be able to share it with every other aspiring\
  \ soul to travel as much as they can because travel empowers us and trains us to\
  \ be independent, more knowledgable and helps us finds ourselves in some way or\
  \ another."
