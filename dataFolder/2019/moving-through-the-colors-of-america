Text: "I find that the United States and the European Union are similar in that they\
  \ are both a conglomeration of states united under a set of rules and regulation,\
  \ but independently each state or country has its own economy, language, and culture.\
  \ It always fascinated me that the U.S. could be made up of regions so fundamentally\
  \ different that the best way to describe the differences was by color coding them.\
  \ This could not be more of the case when comparing the bluest state on the spectrum\u2014\
  California with that of my home state of Texas which is more red than my MAC Russian\
  \ Roulette lipstick. \n\nAs soon as I graduated college I sought my own Manifest\
  \ Destiny and headed West for Los Angeles. I wasn\u2019t met with much backlash\
  \ other than the constant reminder of the high rent rates and parking situation\
  \ or lack thereof. I wasn\u2019t scared. I was more afraid of living the same life\
  \ I had for the past 22 years. My thirst for new experiences was getting the best\
  \ of me. That being said, it isn\u2019t a common thing for a Texan to leave the\
  \ state, at least for good. The ones that do generally wind up moving right back,\
  \ having failed to find the feeling of home in any other place and there is a reason\
  \ for that. \n\nWhether it\u2019s the cheap rent, super stores like H-E-B where\
  \ you can by avocados for less than 50 cents, no state-tax, and parking as far as\
  \ the eye can see, it's no wonder that Texans never leave. It's a good life in the\
  \ Lone Star state. However, for some the slow pace can make life a little dull.\
  \ Next thing I knew I was saddling up my Toyota Highlander, and heading West into\
  \ the sunset over the I-10 freeway. \n   \nUpon my arrival in the City of Angels\
  \ I was taken with the weather, the food, the nature, and of course the opportunity.\
  \ The cost of living in California is exponentially higher than in Texas, but it\
  \ wasn\u2019t the sky high rent, or the price of gas that got to me, it was the\
  \ cost of avocados and the quality of them. No longer could I buy a perfectly ripe\
  \ avocado for under 50 cents. I was in a land where people spent a dollar for a\
  \ glorified brick. \n\nAs I was transitioning from Texas to Cali culture there were\
  \ certain oddities about the people that were inconceivable to me. First, as I was\
  \ having a conversation with a woman about my big move she asked me what my sign\
  \ was. I\u2019m from the bible belt, my first response was, as in a sign from God?\
  \ She replied, \u201CNo your astrological sign.\u201D as if I should of known exactly\
  \ what she was talking about. I\u2019ve found that when in loss of conversation\
  \ topics in LA nothing makes people's eyes light up more than discussing the characteristics\
  \ of their zodiac sign. The next lesson would be the rules of street furniture,\
  \ although in Texas would mean it was free for the taking, in Los Angeles usually\
  \ meant it was infested with bed bugs. It was ludicrous to me that someone would\
  \ just leave their infested furniture on the street as if to say, not my problem\
  \ anymore and it was experiences like this that made me realize just how much of\
  \ an outsider I was.\n\nAfter what seemed like a series of unfortunate events, to\
  \ which people in LA blame on Mercury in Retrograde, some wonderful things happened.\
  \ Things finally came together for me in this place that had I given up on a couple\
  \ months prior. It was crazy how much had changed from my moving pains which crippled\
  \ me with loneliness and homesickness, but instead of letting my emotions get the\
  \ best of me I gave myself the time to become familiar in a new place. I still missed\
  \ my friends, my family, and the avocados back in Texas, but there was a shift happening\
  \ and a shift that happens to everyone who moves away from their home. At some point\
  \ I stopped adapting to life in Cali, and instead started building one."
