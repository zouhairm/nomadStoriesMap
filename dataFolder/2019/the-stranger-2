Text: My teacher once told me that" everything is the same" from our language,culture
  to religion etc, one thing pulls us together and another destroys us, humanity is
  the same everywhere in the world, people feel love the same way ,as well as pain.
  I didn't understand this then but growing older, having opportunity to travel to
  a few places, we realize a lot, sad is the fact that life teaches us too late. My
  story is simple, I once travelled outside Africa and getting to Benin republic a
  nearby country I was welcomed by my tour guide who took me to my Lodge and briefed
  me about my weekly schedule, he left after the brief meeting. The next day started
  with a tour round the country, I was super excited to meet new people and visiting
  new places, I was learning well, we got back after the first day and my tour guide
  left, I wanted to go out to get some snacks at the open space when it dawned on
  me that I couldn't communicate in the people's language,i decided to try I went
  out and when I got to the canteen I met the a young boy who was in charge of the
  shop, it was obvious he was my age and when I tried so hard to communicate I just
  couldn't , surprisingly he brought the exact snacks I wanted with a drink, I paid
  and left wondering how he knew . The rest of the week days, we spent smiling in
  the evening during long stroll, somehow we couldn't communicate but our hearts understood,
  this is not a story of love, it is a story of language, how a person couldn't understand
  my language but knew when I said I wanted water etc, how I couldn't understand his
  language but laughed at a funny joke and kept mute at the climax of a story.. it
  continued till i had to leave the country back to my home country. I remember him
  asking me why I didn't want a particular food when i said I didn't in my language
  under my breath, in the end just like humanity our language is part of us, it connects
  us from within, I never knew I would make a good local connection.
