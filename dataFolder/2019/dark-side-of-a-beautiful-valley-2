Text: "In December 2017, I along with my family decided to go on a vacation. After\
  \ a long discussion, all of us agreed to visit Kashmir, a conflicted region between\
  \ India and Pakistan. Being a citizen of Pakistan, I always fascinated by the sight\
  \ of Kashmir. It is said to be the most beautiful region of the country. We arrived\
  \ at the bus station in the morning and by the next morning; we were at the hotel\
  \ in Kashmir. After having rest for a few hours, we explored the beauty of Kashmir.\
  \ We rented a vehicle and started exploring the mountains. Kashmir is one of the\
  \ coolest places in Pakistan. The mountains were covered with snow, depicting beautiful\
  \ scenery. The light snowfall was proving the icing on the cake for the scene. I\
  \ wouldn\u2019t be wrong in saying it was heaven on earth. \nThe people of Kashmir\
  \ were the most hospitable people I had ever come across. We hired a guide who took\
  \ us to various places in Kashmir. While exploring the beauty of that area, we had\
  \ contact with an old person who owned a resort near the line of control, which\
  \ is the border between India and Pakistan. We had a conversation while having tea.\
  \ During the meeting, he told us about his life in Kashmir. He let us know about\
  \ his family, which lived on the opposite side of the border, and how that border\
  \ was affecting lives on both sides. While telling us about his life he sobbed by\
  \ remembering his parents, who were dead and because of the problems between the\
  \ two countries, he couldn\u2019t even attend their funerals. \nMost of the border\
  \ between India and Pakistan is a water passage, which is called Neelum River by\
  \ the people of Pakistan. The people on one side of the border can see their loved\
  \ ones on the opposite side of the border but can\u2019t reach them because of difficulty\
  \ in getting visa of the other country. Many people, living in the so-called heaven,\
  \ have the same story as that of the old man and have been trying to reach their\
  \ families for decades. \nBeing a citizen of Pakistan, the dark side of the beautiful\
  \ valley inhabited by people having beautiful hearts stunned me. The region is the\
  \ center of attraction for many tourists inside and outside the country, but, the\
  \ aboriginal peoples there live their worst lives with the grief of the absence\
  \ of their family. My family and I, being from the middle class, couldn\u2019t do\
  \ anything but to console that old man. \nThis vacation is one of the most memorable\
  \ vacations of my life. I could never forget the eyes of that old man filled with\
  \ grief. The government of both countries must take initiatives to improve the emotional\
  \ status of the citizens in that region. The United Nations should take the matter\
  \ seriously and make decisions. I, myself want to help my country fellows and aspire\
  \ to become a Foreign officer of Pakistan to solve this critical issue between the\
  \ two countries."
