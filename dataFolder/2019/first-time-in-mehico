Text: "I was away from home for the longest time I had been in my lifetime, yet not\
  \ even a third of the way through. Replacing the iconic Mall's Balls for the equally\
  \ impressive CN Tower. Beaches for snow, good coffee for ... Tim Hortons. The differences\
  \ were abundant, but not severe. I had wanted to travel on my university exchange\
  \ to Toronto. All was comfortable, but then my boyfriend suggested we meet halfway\
  \ in Mexico.\n\nMexico. The most I knew about Mexico was drug cartels and The Wall.\
  \ I had every intention of suggesting elsewhere, but hey, return flights were only\
  \ $300 and curiosity got the better of me. Armed with only some Duolingo I catch\
  \ my flight.\n\nI meet my boyfriend in the airport and we get a taxi to our accommodation.\
  \ The driver flew through the streets, narrowly missing cars. Driving through a\
  \ tunnel with the windows wound down I could not ignore a police siren blaring.\
  \ Overtaking us, a military styled truck with six policemen standing on the back.\
  \ Stoic looks on their faces as they gripped guns bigger than their torsos. I wonder\
  \ what I am doing, what have I done. \n\n\"First time Mehico?\" the cab driver jokes,\
  \ enjoying my expression I thought I was hiding well. \n\nWe were dropped off two\
  \ blocks too early, but only realised too late. It was quite late at night, a food\
  \ truck illuminating in the distance being the brightest light around. Even when\
  \ way closer to midnight then midday on a suburban street there were still people\
  \ around. Some roadworks on the left, a shopkeeper sweeping his storefront and people\
  \ huddling around the food truck. As I get closer I see that the group around the\
  \ food truck are watching a sports game. The sense of community was apparent before\
  \ I had even gotten to my accomodation. \n\nThe next day the road that leads to\
  \ the Palacio Belle de Artes is shoulder to shoulder, made more crowded by the amount\
  \ of street vendors. Street vendors that if they cannot have your money, they will\
  \ do their best to take your time. When approaching the building, the contrasting\
  \ yellow roof with the off white of the sculpted walls surrounded by angels, both\
  \ metal and concrete makes The Palacio Belle de Artes a non-comparable beauty. Ideally\
  \ viewed from the adjacent cafe on the eighth floor so that the perfectly kept gardens\
  \ and titanic hills can be enjoyed while tasting a rich Spanish hot chocolate. That\
  \ is until you realise Mexico's unfortunate high occurrence of earthquakes, and\
  \ you're on the eighth floor. \n\nI was struck by how homely La Condesa, a neighborhood\
  \ just outside of the CBD, was. A cafe on every corner of the perfectly structured\
  \ streets. The welcome difference being the beautiful colours of the houses. Due\
  \ to no space between them all would look like the same building without the bright\
  \ pinks, vivid oranges and light blues. Ordering a coffee in my broken Spanish I\
  \ enjoy the best coffee I found in North America. Looking at the cup I see it is\
  \ beautifully made with hand painted pink floral patterns. Putting the need for\
  \ my own set above my pride I ask the barista \"\xBFD\xF3nde est\xE1?\" while pointing\
  \ at the cup. My only way of finding out was asking \"Where is it?\" while pointing\
  \ at the cup. Perplexed for a second, wondering if perhaps the simple tourist does\
  \ not understand that if you drink coffee, it disappears, a look of understanding\
  \ came over her face and she said \"Puebla\". After an onslaught of graciases on\
  \ my part I look up Puebla, but without enough time to go I promise that next time\
  \ I will. \n\nUpon returning to frosty Toronto, I reflected on how glad I was that\
  \ I leapt into the unknown. I left with a respect and admiration for a country that\
  \ is not without its problems, but not to the extent of the portrayal by the media.\
  \ Travelling outside of my comfort zone has ignited my interest in the Spanish language\
  \ and taught me that sometimes $300 flights are well worth it."
