Text: "I should have stayed within the path... It was looking at me with forced indifference\
  \ but with an underlying tension... Unable to move and stricken by an irrational\
  \ laughter I kept sinking deeper and deeper.\n\nIt all started in yet another sunny\
  \ day during our trip in Costa Rica. We were staying in a hotel in the middle of\
  \ the mangroves of Tortuguero and, after seeing some turtles hatch the day before\
  \ I was hooked. I needed to see more nature in a more wild scenario. It was perfect\
  \ when a local guy offered to guide us through the jungle to see some wildlife in\
  \ its truest habitat.\n\nManuel - that was his name - helped us into his boat and\
  \ we started sailing up the river. He told us he knew the jungle very well because\
  \ he used to be a poacher, but he quit and started working as a guide because he\
  \ felt too guilty. After a few minutes of trying to decide if each floating branch\
  \ was in fact a branch or yet another caiman, we arrived at the start of our trekking\
  \ trail. Trekking trail is a big title, because there was just slightly more space\
  \ between the plants rather than being anything manmade.\n\nWe started walking through\
  \ the jungle and suddenly it was like being indoors. The trees felt like a wall\
  \ and the canopy was a ceiling. The humidity was dense and so were the smells. And\
  \ the sounds... there were so many sounds that it was hard to distinguish what was\
  \ coming from where.\_\n\nA tucan flew in front of us, nimbly avoiding the many\
  \ lianas that were hanging from the rainforest's canopy.\n\nA red-eyed treefrog,\
  \ the symbol of Costa Rica, lazily hanged from a leaf, as if it was feeling as the\
  \ country's flag.\n\nA group of five mantled howler monkeys that were swinging from\
  \ tree to tree stopped - both their swinging and their howling - and looked at us\
  \ curiously. After a few seconds they continued their path.\n\nThis was just the\
  \ beginning and, as a young biologist to be, it was too much for me in the best\
  \ of ways. I couldn't stop moving from side to side looking at every little animal\
  \ or sculpture-like plant. Everything was so alive in the jungle, much more than\
  \ in any forest I had been before. And nothing seem to care much that we, the outsiders,\
  \ were wandering around.\n\nIn my frenzy of discoveries, I walked outside of the\
  \ not-so-clear-trail and suddenly I was stuck. At first I did not understand what\
  \ was happening, as I kept trying to move forward. It just seemed that the forest\
  \ ground was lifting. Only it was the opposite. It was me that was sinking. In my\
  \ cluelessness I stepped on quicksand and one of my friends was sinking as well\
  \ not far from me.\n\nOne man in our group started to walk towards us to help us\
  \ out, but the guide pushed him very hard, making him take a leap forward. He turned\
  \ around confused and the guide yelled \"Es una sincejas!\" which roughly translates\
  \ into \"it's a brow-less\". We were still confused. The guide then pointed at the\
  \ floor and we saw a tiny snake rolled over itself right next to where we were.\
  \ Manuel told us that this kind of snakes, the velvets, were very venomous and could\
  \ kill us all in one quick attack, so we would have to move swiftly but without\
  \ bothering it.\n\nFor a while they struggled trying to lift us up from the quicksand\
  \ while the snake kept looking at us and showing its forked tongue to smell us.\
  \ Luckily, they eventually managed to bring us back up using some branches and the\
  \ snake did not move much during the cumbersome opperation. In the end, it was nothing\
  \ more than a scare, but it gave me a brief showcase of why the jungle is not a\
  \ playground. It's alive, it's powerful, it's dangerous and it's dangerously beautiful.\
  \ \_That is why I still cherish that experience as one of the best in my life."
