Text: "\"Est-ce que vous avez des batons de marche?\"\n\nI\u2019d spent the summer\
  \ working in France, but this was beyond my vocabulary. Do I have--? I\u2019d knit\
  \ my brows until the woman in the passenger seat craned her body around to look\
  \ at me.\n\n\"Batons de marche!\" she said, swinging her arms back and forth. Walking\
  \ wands? I\u2019d just shaken my head, confused.\n\nIt\u2019s not until I\u2019\
  m halfway up a mountain in the Pyrenees, facedown in a river, that I realize what\
  \ she\u2019d meant.\n\nAnd no, I do not have hiking poles.\n\nWhat I do have: one\
  \ men\u2019s steel-frame backpack, last used in 1976, borrowed from a coworker\u2019\
  s dad; a little food, purchased from a supermarket in the tiny town of Tarascon-sur-Ariege,\
  \ the last stop on the regional train; a map; the clothes on my back; and these\
  \ instructions from my coworker:\n\n\"Go to the roundabout. Hitchhike up the canyon,\
  \ then hike about a mile until you get to a tight switchback. A trail splits off\
  \ to the right. You\u2019ll pass three lakes and then arrive at the refuge des \xE9\
  tangs de Bassi\xE8s, a little hut where you can stay. The area is gorgeous, and\
  \ I met tons of other people. It\u2019ll be the best trip of your life.\"\n\nSo\
  \ far, it seems like the craziest decision of my life. In off-kilter French, I\u2019\
  d somehow managed to convince the couple who\u2019d picked me up to drop me off\
  \ on the side of the road in the middle of nowhere. I\u2019d found the trail, which\
  \ cleaves straight up the side of the mountain with no respite. The backpack\u2019\
  s frame digs painfully into my hips. The weight of it throws me off as I try to\
  \ leap from stone to stone across a shallow stream, leaving me soaked. So here I\
  \ am: wet, exhausted, alone, hoping that I haven\u2019t made a huge mistake.\n\n\
  I\u2019m in a bank of fog so thick that I can\u2019t see more than a few yards down\
  \ the trail. I worry that I\u2019ll walk right past my destination without knowing\
  \ it. Finally, I spot it: a low building hunkered down among erratic boulders. I\
  \ know that \u201Crefuge\u201D is just the French term for a hikers\u2019 hut, but\
  \ right now, it\u2019s really living up to its name. \n\nInside, the refuge is eerily\
  \ silent. After a few confused calls of \u201Cbonjour?\u201D a worker greets me.\
  \ She\u2019s around my age and speaks no English. My tongue is clumsy and I stumble\
  \ my way through the brief French conversation, but eventually she leads me to the\
  \ sleeping quarters. She gestures broadly. No words necessary to make her meaning\
  \ clear: I can have any bed I want, because I\u2019m the only person here. Definitely\
  \ not the hub of activity my friend had described.\n\nA little disappointed, I spread\
  \ my borrowed sleeping bag on a wooden frame and promptly fall asleep.\n\nI wake\
  \ in the morning to knocking. After a few bleary blinks, my eyes adjust to the sunlight\
  \ pouring through the small window, and I see the refuge keeper standing in the\
  \ doorframe. She gestures at me excitedly. \u201CVenez!\u201D she says. \u201CD\xE9\
  p\xEAchez-vous!\u201D \n\nConfused, I follow her outside. I guess my gasp is audible,\
  \ because she turns and laughs at the look on my face. \n\nIn the bright morning\
  \ light, I can see that we\u2019re beneath the headwall of a tall cirque. Steep\
  \ granite peaks flank us, snow still clinging to the tops of them even though it\u2019\
  s early August. Below us, where yesterday I\u2019d wound my way up a trail cloaked\
  \ in mist, I can see three lakes strung out like a necklace across the green glaciated\
  \ bowl. The view is stunning, but we\u2019re not the only ones appreciating it.\n\
  \nThe refuge is surrounded by a group of wild horses. They look up as we approach\
  \ them but seem totally unconcerned, continuing to graze contentedly. We sit on\
  \ a rock near the edge of the herd.  \u201CLes chevals?\u201D I whisper to my new\
  \ friend, and she nods, the corners of her lips turning up. We sit there in silence,\
  \ amidst the soft whicker of the horses and the stark beauty of the Pyrenees, until\
  \ it\u2019s time to head in and have our own breakfast."
