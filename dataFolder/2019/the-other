Text: "The guide\u2019s wakeup call pierced through frail polyester at 1:00 am. Climbing\
  \ out of our precariously pitched tent, Betsi and I were careful not to trip down\
  \ the thin ledge. It was an inky black morning, but we knew just how steep the mountain\
  \ of black-gray sand tumbled down. And more than that, we were painfully aware of\
  \ just how difficult it was to climb up it. Each step in the sand sunk a backwards\
  \ a bit, as if Misti herself was toying with us: \"You may try, mi amor, but did\
  \ you expect me to make it easy?\"\n\nI clearly had. Training every day by running\
  \ ought to have sufficiently prepared me, right? Wrong. Heck, I didn\u2019t even\
  \ think to bring winter gloves. In the Peruvian city of Arequipa, I had severely\
  \ underestimated just how cold it would get on the stratovolcano bordering the city.\
  \ The moment the sun set the night before, the temperature had plummeted. My Nalgene\
  \ that I left out of my sleeping bag last night? Frozen solid.\n\nBetsi was kind\
  \ enough to lend me her water while we scarfed down a quick breakfast with the rest\
  \ of the group. 1:30 am. Four other Calvin College students studying abroad like\
  \ us, five tourists, three guides. We were surprised to hear that one guide would\
  \ stay at base camp while we attempted an ascent.\n\n\u201CSomeone always ends up\
  \ turning back,\u201D the main guide told us with a shrug. \u201CSome just can\u2019\
  t take the elevation change.\u201D\n\nWith that enthusiastic vote of confidence,\
  \ we began the ascent at 2:00 am, armed with headlamps, 20-liter backpacks, and\
  \ walking sticks. I was the only one with nearly frozen hands.\n\nThe guide called\
  \ it an ascent, but surely he meant \u201Cextreme zig-zagging\u201D. Shuffling back\
  \ and forth, up this mountain of rocky black sand, the summit a faint outline above\
  \ us loomed like Pachamama, the ever independent, legendary, primordial Incan goddess\
  \ of earth and time. For, the goddess did distort time during that darkness. Each\
  \ step higher, each foot of altitude, each grain of sand that embedded itself in\
  \ our clothes and ratty shoes, she took liberties to further toy with our brains.\
  \ Were we really moving? Had we already passed this part of the route? \n\nAt 4:00\
  \ am the sky began to blush like chicha morado and cactus fruit juice. At 4:30 am,\
  \ the sun crested the eastern edge, dressing up Misti in ribbons of molten gold,\
  \ the likes of which had not been known to Peru since pre-conquistador times.\n\n\
  One by one, the rest of my group passed me by. The sun warmed my hands out of a\
  \ frozen purgatory of numbness, but the altitude wrapped its boa-constrictor grasp\
  \ tighter around my mind. I slipped back into a memory to my first night in Arequipa.\
  \ Months ago, when I had met mi hermana intercambio, my foreign exchange sister\
  \ from Paraguay, Araceli. \n\nA buxom, sprout of a woman with long black hair, Araceli\
  \ was nearly five years older I was. \n\nI remember pulling the cup toward myself,\
  \ the instant coffee had scalded my hands. Araceli had peered at me from across\
  \ the table.  \n\nAfter all the vocab words I had learned in college classes, vocab\
  \ about traveling, school, literature, emotions, the vocab of a simple dinner table\
  \ had brought me low in my nervousness; I couldn\u2019t remember the word for napkin.\n\
  \nAraceli smiled. \u201CServilleta.\u201D\n\nFrom then on, it became our custom\
  \ for her to quiz me on general vocabulary every time we had dinner together, in\
  \ a simple, nonjudgmental way.\n\nThe confidence cultivated in your home country\
  \ is humbled by the cultural difference of another where you become the \u201Cother.\u201D\
  \ You have to become comfortable with being uncomfortable. Fail well, take a deep\
  \ breath, and take a flying leap into the unknown.\n\nThe rest of my group summited\
  \ at 8:00 am and my humbled self summited all 19,101 ft. of Misti at 8:20 am.\n\n\
  Tomorrow will still get here, one way or another.\nYou\u2019ll figure out how to\
  \ get through dinner, one way or another.\nYou\u2019ll get to the top of the mountain,\
  \ even if you end up being the last one to summit."
