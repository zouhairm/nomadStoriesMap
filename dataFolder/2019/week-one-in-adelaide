Text: "I am currently studying as an exchange student in Adelaide, Australia for the\
  \ current 2019 semester. I've been in my apartment for almost a week and it is really\
  \ sinking in that I will be living here for the next 5 months.  The last few days\
  \ I have been settling in, making friends, and exploring the city and campus.  Of\
  \ course, I have also been to the beach three times.  The city and the campus are\
  \ both beautiful, but very different from back home.  Here in Australia the campus\
  \ feels separate from the outside world, there is lots of green space and lots of\
  \ outdoors vendors.\n\nHere in Adelaide, I am living in an apartment with eight\
  \ people in it, which is a lot, but so far I get along amazingly with all of my\
  \ roommates. I am the only Canadian, and there are also 4 Americans, 1 German, 1\
  \ Malaysian and 1 British girl. It's super fun that the majority of us have just\
  \ arrived in Australia and are all navigating some parts of being in a new country\
  \ together. It has been really interesting to get to know people who have lived\
  \ quite different lives from myself, most specifically in university. For example,\
  \ the American girls are all involved in greek life, which is something we do not\
  \ really have in Canada, at least not on the same level. On the other hand, it is\
  \ crazy how much we all have in common, most importantly our yearning for adventure.\
  \  \n\nAnd the city of Adelaide and its surroundings are filled with opportunities\
  \ to fill that yearning. In just over a week we have explored beaches, national\
  \ parks and gotten to know locals. I  as well have had the opportunity to learn\
  \ to surf. I have never been super comfortable in the ocean and this was quite far\
  \ out of my comfort zone. I was surprised when it ended up being an incredibly fun\
  \ day, I was also surprised I managed to actually stand on the surf board. \n\n\
  Coming here, for me was a crazy leap into the unknown.  I am still adjusting to\
  \ some elements of the different lifestyle here. I am trying new things including\
  \ foods, like squid, and I am having the time of my life.\n\nHeres to chapter one\
  \ of what I know will be a beautiful story."
