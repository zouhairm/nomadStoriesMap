Text: "Flying into Marrakech, the Atlas Mountains loom on the horizon, and it's easy\
  \ to see why the ancient Greeks imagined this imposing presence at the edge of their\
  \ world as a giant carrying the weight of Everything on his shoulders.\P\nMe, I'm\
  \ leaving the weight of the world behind me for a few days, and I'm doing it at\
  \ the edge of the Atlas in more ways than one. Like the Greeks of old I haven't\
  \ gone beyond the straits of Hercules (Gibraltar) before, and riding into the bustle\
  \ of the Medina I quickly realise that I have indeed entered a very different world.\P\
  \nMy young driver Mohammed enthusiastically extols the virtues of his good Muslim\
  \ wife and cousin who is never allowed to leave his house, and only breaks off his\
  \ monologue when he suddenly clips the rear wheel of one of the many mopeds that\
  \ swarm in front if us.\P\nThe car sends the moped and its hapless rider tottering\
  \ right into the arms of two armed policemen. They witnessed the whole thing, and\
  \ I fear the worst, but a rapid-fire exchange in Arabic is apparently the only consequence\
  \ this mishap will have, and so on we go through ever tighter alleys, weaving in\
  \ and out between people, dogs, food stalls, donkeys, mopeds, often missing them\
  \ by nothing but a hair's breadth.\P\nWhen we finally reach the riad I have already\
  \ come to the conclusion that Mohammed's wife has got the situation sussed, and\
  \ that my only hope of surviving this sojourn is to stay resolutely indoors. Luckily\
  \ my hostess, the lovely Maria, soon convinces me otherwise.\P\nShe shows me the\
  \ beautiful inner court yard with its ornamental pool and sky light, and my opulent\
  \ bed, which looks like something Scheherezade could have been telling her tales\
  \ in - the sight of which only strengthens my resolve - but then she takes me to\
  \ the roof terrace, serves me dates and mint tea, and as we look over the rooftops\
  \ of this medieval labyrinth and the last call to prayer of the day sounds in the\
  \ velvety darkness as it has for a thousand and one years, I feel as if the call\
  \ is for me, and me alone.\P\nSuddenly I cannot wait to go exploring tomorrow, and\
  \ Maria - who clearly has seen this reaction before - grins as if to say I told\
  \ you so...\P\nAfter a breakfast for sheiks that included snake pancake (thankfully\
  \ named after its shape rather than its ingredients), Maria insisted on taking me\
  \ to the main square of the old town. I thought her care for me a little overprotective.\
  \ How wrong I was! \PThe onslaught to the senses as you enter the Medina is difficult\
  \ to describe. Donkeys bray, music (like bagpipers on speed) plays, mopeds bleat,\
  \ the perfume of sandalwood and strange spices mix with car fumes and the wood smoke\
  \ from the hammams, and everywhere sights to behold, spilling out of the little\
  \ shops like cornucopias; multicoloured earthenware and cloth, even more colourful\
  \ merchants, wrought ironwork, food (one store apparently sold nothing but lamb\
  \ stomachs, another had two sets of cow's hoofs neatly placed in the street, making\
  \ me wonder if they had sold off the animal piece by piece from the top down), you\
  \ name it, it was there.\P\nWith Maria\u2019s assistance we got through the maze\
  \ without difficulty, in spite of me gawping at everything and putting questions\
  \ to her every ten seconds like an over-excited five-year-old.\P\nShe showed me\
  \ a donkey parking, caravanserais, shops where they kept live fowl, a man transporting\
  \ 3,000 eggs on the back of his moped at high speed, a snake charmer and a monkey\
  \ trainer having a violent argument while their respective wards faced off with\
  \ an air of inscrutable patience. She taught me the importance of choosing honey\
  \ patisserie-makers on the basis of how many wasps their wares attracted, and fishmongers\
  \ on the basis of how few stray cats they attracted. It was all rather marvellous.\P\
  Once Maria left me on Jmaa el Fna I got gloriously, impossibly lost in the souk,\
  \ where I spent hours wandering about, happily haggling, admiring the architecture,\
  \ dodging donkey carts, drinking it all in. Souking it up."
