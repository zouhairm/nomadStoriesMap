Text: "Traveling they say is part of informal education. And also it exposes one to\
  \ unique opportunities and open one up to different cultures and socioeconomic awareness.\n\
  When I first made visited Kenya in 2015,it was exciting feelings for me and I capitalized\
  \ on the opportunity to look for business opportunity which I was unable to align\
  \ and discovered bitcoin business.\n\nAfter a while I built a serious relationship\
  \ which friends I met in Kenya and we started developing business partnership that\
  \ translated into a little job creation and a mini profitable business to me and\
  \ my community of friends in Nigeria.\n\nMy journey to Kenya has remain indelible\
  \ to me because I I made new international friends and learnt new ways of life and\
  \ thinking and perceptions towards life drastically was altered. My thinking changed.\n\
  \nI have always longed to have a personal relationships with people from another\
  \ country in person outside through the internet or social media. Because they don't\
  \ take one  serious.\n\nThe experience was power packed,my first time of entering\
  \ the air plane. Was exciting. I was able to assimilate a foreign language and thought\
  \ of keeping a foreign relationship, just as my first employer in Nigeria where\
  \ i hail from,who married a Kenyan. \n\nAnd till date we both have really kept the\
  \ momentum of our relationship afloat. And of recent a friend of my got a contract\
  \ in Tanzania to supply Computer gadgets, and we needed some one to help us get\
  \ the quotations I mean process of these computers. \n\nI contacted her and she\
  \ didn't hesitate to do the whole process of helping us getting the process and\
  \ the whole process became a success to us. And I began to tell my friend here in\
  \ Nigeria. If I hadn't made that traveling venture to Kenya. We won't have been\
  \ able to have a head way in that business.\n\nAnother benefit of traveling to Kenya,was\
  \ my connection to be able to establish a coffin tea business importation into Nigeria,\
  \ which is also a lucrative business to me. And I have been supplying some hotels\
  \ coffin teas for some time now. \n\nI never knew that East Africa Kenya and Rwanda\
  \ had some much enormous Coffin tea in abundance. And I got them at a cheap price\
  \ over there than in Nigeria.\n\nOne of my exiting moment again,was when one of\
  \ my friends in Kenya contacted me over the social media in 2017 that he wants to\
  \ visit Nigeria. He came and little did I know that he was making plans to invest\
  \ into our oil industry business. \n\nAlthough till date we are still trying to\
  \ secure a license, but am confident that if he succeeds it will be a landmark in\
  \ our lives,and it will also help me to create employment in my country Nigeria.\
  \ Because I will be the representative here I'm Nigeria handling his business\n\n\
  Am still yearning for more opportunities to travel and see how the world culture\
  \ looks like,I have watched  different types foods on TV especially CNN. Visiting\
  \ Portugal will be a remarkable milestone in my life.\n\nI was so proud of having\
  \ a foreign friend visiting me in my country and my friends were envious of me having\
  \ an international friends that have an entrepreneurial mindset and wants to invest\
  \ in my country. \n\nI still want to travel so that I can still interact with people\
  \ and look our for international opportunity to see what I can import into my country\
  \ and make money,establish international relationship.\n\nIf given this opportunity\
  \ to be part of this Portugal unique trip. It will be a life time opportunity that\
  \ I would continue to Cherish because, it would enable me look for used cars,cloths,shoes,to\
  \ import into my country for me to create multiple chains of business. I also looking\
  \ forward to do my masters program and learn the language sir.\n\nAm looking looking\
  \ forward to get a positive response from your organization as I have indicated\
  \ interest of being part of the cutting edge as you shortlist candidates for this\
  \ international opportunity venture sir.\nGod bless you as I anticipated to be among\
