Text: "Not I one I am afraid of airplanes. Sleeping me is desirable, and falling asleep\
  \ is terrible - I will leave off to hear turbines.Only I fall asleep and wake up\
  \ here - I do not hear a turbine. But flight made off the soft landing and I saw\
  \ a sun. A sun above a sea. A sun of Africa! We went out next to an embankment and\
  \ followed by suitcases along her, I could not hold out certainly, left a husband\
  \ and suitcase, and with daughter born to the sea. Sand was surprisingly dense,\
  \ and water incredibly affectionate. A sea does not release. How to explain to the\
  \ husband, that can not I simply step back from a sea and go off farther to the\
  \ suites of rooms?Woman that passed us smiled, seeing as we in a travelling clothing\
  \ swash at shore. Yes, ahead month, but sea it right here and now.\n\nAt shore of\
  \ sea you understand that all of it existed for much thousand years to you, and\
  \ it will be perfectly to feel after you. Similarly Archimedes a few millenniums\
  \ to you sat ashore sea and accomplished opening, but you not Archimedes, and you\
  \ how hardly will leave such track in history of humanity. But there, at a glaze\
  \ sea it becoming is not important. you are not sad that you just one of milliards\
  \ of above-ground on a planet, you are simply happy from everything: salt water,\
  \ playing fishes, at times scalding suns, local tart wine, goat's cheese.\n\nAnd\
  \ these surprising locals that is truly glad to you. That you arrived to them on\
  \ an island and divide their daily happiness from the surrounding world. They all\
  \ are simply quietly happy,and when conversation calls about a sea, sun, fish and\
  \ other \u043F\u0440\u0435\u043B\u0435\u0441\u0442\u044F\u0445 of their life, they\
  \ simply consent and talk: \"Yes, it was\" lucky us. All and all on this island\
  \ talks : \"Guys, thank you that arrived. Do you depart exactly? you in fact understand\
  \ that this life exactly that life about that you do not wake to spare in her"
