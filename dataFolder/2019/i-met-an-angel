Text: "It was 3 o\u2019clock in the morning, me and my friend were in Cusco on our\
  \ way to Machu Picchu in a tourist van. The van was picking up the tourists around\
  \ Cusco, and we were so tired that we could barely open our eyes, but I am glad\
  \ I did, the van\u2019s door opened and I saw the divine figure: a tall guy with\
  \ curly blonde hair was illuminated by the light pole ready to enter the van. He\
  \ came in and sat next to me, and then I slept. I woke up in Ollantaytambo and I\
  \ turned my head to the right and he was there, sleeping like an angel. I was glad\
  \ I was not delirious, people say that big quantities of coca products can mess\
  \ with your head! We all left the van, took a train to Aguas Calientes and when\
  \ we got there we went to the venue where Machu Picchu tickets are sold, then the\
  \ guides splited us in two groups: the young group and the familiar group. I was\
  \ part of the young group with my friend and other people who were traveling alone,\
  \ and of course the intriguing guy was a part of it too. After we bought our tickets,\
  \ we all went to the main square and sat on the bench, and that was when my friend\
  \ realize that she forgot to do the check in for the flight she was going to take\
  \ that night. We were looking for free wi-fi but there was not any available there,\
  \ so she started to panic and suddenly we heard someone trying to get our attention,\
  \ we turned around and there he was, staring at us with those big blue eyes and\
  \ a smile on his face trying to speak Portuguese. He asked if we needed any help\
  \ with a cute accent and then offered to share his cellphone internet connection\
  \ with us, and then everything went well. We started to speak and he introduced\
  \ himself: Leo, from Germany, traveling alone. I knew that only residents could\
  \ have a SIM Card in Peru, so I asked him how he managed to get one, and he said\
  \ that he was actually living there for a couple of months, doing what an angel\
  \ would do: volunteering. Leo has my age and left his family to help people around\
  \ the world, starting in Peru, and after volunteering in some villages helping families\
  \ and children, he decided to take that little trip, where we met. I was just amazed\
  \ with everything that he told me, he was fluent in English and Spanish, besides\
  \ German of course, and was trying to speak Portuguese to help us, since my friend\
  \ and I were speaking in Portuguese. The guide took us to another van, we went in\
  \ separated seats and when we entered Machu Picchu we could not speak as much as\
  \ we could before because we needed to pay attention to the guide\u2019s explanations\
  \ and to one of the Seven Wonders of the World. A girl in our group injured her\
  \ leg and Leo was there to help, I do not know if I was paying more attention to\
  \ him or to the Incan city at that time, I have never met someone like him before,\
  \ so genuine and worried about others. My friend and I were running out of time\
  \ when we realized we were late to take an early train in the afternoon, we needed\
  \ to be in Cusco on time for her flight. I looked at him and said goodbye, he smiled\
  \ and wished us a good trip, I never saw him again. I met an angel at one of the\
  \ Seven Wonders of the World and his name is Leo."
