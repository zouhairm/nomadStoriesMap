Text: "If you have ever lived in Germany, you'd know that banking here can be a bit\
  \ of a challenge. Think of German banking as that eccentric and annoying father-in-law\
  \ who is really old and stuck up about the rules, and speaks words only he can understand.\
  \ After a lot of frustrating episodes, you learn to tolerate them. But who would\
  \ have thought that at times they can be downright hilarious?\_\n\nThe year was\
  \ 2015. I was traveling to Miami to attend the ADC Festival of Creativity. I was\
  \ excited to start the day with a Breakfast Burrito and end it with a Cubano at\
  \ Versailles. Explore the Graffiti scene at Wynwood and rub shoulders with a ton\
  \ of very talented creatives from all over the world at the festival. Later I would\
  \ carry on to New Orleans to attend the Jazz Festival.\n\nTo my horror, I discovered\
  \ on Day #1 that my \"International\" German bank card weren't working in the local\
  \ ATMs. I had limited cash. I shot an email to my bank hoping they could resolve\
  \ the issue quikly. But in the meantime, I just had to rely solely on my credit\
  \ card.\n\nAnyone who has been stranded in a city without cash would know how strange\
  \ it feels\u200A-\u200Ayou find yourself considering every purchase, every coffee,\
  \ each cab ride. Worse still is when you've just bought something, and then sheepishly\
  \ realise that your ability to pay for the said thing depends on the precarious\
  \ chance that the vendor accepts a credit card. Thankfully Miami is quite card-friendly,\
  \ so I could charge even a stick of gum to my credit card. But my time wasn't without\
  \ some awkward situations where I had to ask my friends if they would let me pay\
  \ for group lunches and dinners with my card and they could pay me cash.\_\n\nNevertheless,\
  \ I was determined to enjoy my time there to the fullest. The festival was fun,\
  \ a never-ending 5-day party with sun, music, booze, friends, tons of dips in the\
  \ sea and the pool, and tons of creativity.\n\nA week later the festival came to\
  \ a close, and I prepared to fly to New Orleans, which I had heard was way less\
  \ card friendly\u200A-\u200Aspecially the festival itself. Can you imagine buying\
  \ a snack and a beer inside the festival and holding up your credit card? I couldn't.\
  \ My hostel had also asked me to bring along cash for payment, cash I didn't have.\
  \ I was too embarrassed to even let my friends know about my NoLa-cash problem,\
  \ let alone ask for help.\n\nIt was our last day in Miami, we were packing up, saying\
  \ goodbyes, recovering from the hangovers. I was about to leave for the airport\
  \ when Laura and Marvin, a my friends from Costa Rica who were on their honeymoon,\
  \ came to my room and shoved 500 dollars in my hand.\_\n\n\"We are flying home directly\
  \ and we have American Dollars left over. We don't need them, so here.\"\n\nI didn't\
  \ know Laura and Marvin so well. I had met Laura a few years ago in New York, and\
  \ it was my first time meeting Marvin, her husband, but the festival had brought\
  \ us closer together. Still, I was amazed that they could trust me with their savings,\
  \ not even knowing if they will see me again or if I will return it. But in that\
  \ moment they were my favourite people in the world. I was overwhelmed with their\
  \ kindness. Among a swarm of thank you's, warm hugs and promises to stay in touch,\
  \ we said our goodbyes.\n\nI was surprised at how relaxed I felt when I landed in\
  \ the Big Easy. As I cabbed it to my hostel, I started to get excited about the\
  \ city, about the upcoming Po' Boys and the Jambalayas, the Sax and the Pianos,\
  \ and beers and the G&Ts. Just then I received an email from my bank, a complete\
  \ week after I had written to them. Their reply, in English:\_\n\n\"Thank you for\
  \ your email. We kindly ask you to send us your request again in German.\"\n\nI\
  \ was in NoLa. It was time to 'take it easy, but take it'."
