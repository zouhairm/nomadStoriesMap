Text: "Rio de Janeiro. Monday morning.\n\n\"Hey there! I`m arriving!\", Demi called\
  \ me, while I was hugging the pillow and trying to sleep a little bit more. \nJust\
  \ the idea of reaching the top of Pedra da G\xE1vea was enough for me to get goosebumbs.\
  \ \n\n\"Come on girl! You don`t want to miss the greatest adventure you have ever\
  \ had, do you?\" she insisted. \n\nSo I took a leap into the unknown and that was\
  \ only the beginning. While going through the Tijuca Range with its mysterious forest,\
  \ wild animals and irritating insects, we couldn`t wait for a moment to do the hardest\
  \ trekking and see one of the most beautiful places in Brazil from the top! Despite\
  \ the sun, which had almost burnt our skin, we were full of enthusiasm.\n\nSounds\
  \ great, right? But it wasn`t a piece of cake for us! I can even write a book of\
  \ good advice for those people, who have never done trekking before. It could be\
  \ a bestseller, I`m pretty much sure.\n\nFirstly, we were ran out of water and food\
  \ . We got so exhausted, as we had been working all day long as slaves. That`s why\
  \ we had almost nothing in the backpacks in 20-30 minutes. Anyway, it was easier\
  \ to continue the trip without a lot of stuff. I always try to be optimistic, you\
  \ see!\n\n- \"Tranquilo!\" - my friend told me. It`s a portuguese word, that can\
  \ describe the Brazilian way of life (\"take everything easy!\").\n\nHave you ever\
  \ tried to get to the top of a mountain without comfortable sneakers? I have! It`s\
  \ an unforgettable feeling when there is only one sole. It`s like being a pirate\
  \ with a wooden leg. Anyway, I was too excited to reach the goal!\n\n- \"Tranquilo!\"\
  \ - I said. \"Let`s move on!\"\n\nSomewhere deep inside the forest, among a lot\
  \ of stones we found a spring of water with unbelievably delicious taste! Fresh,\
  \ healthy water...and nothing else matter! The way to the mountain was getting harder\
  \ and harder. Under the blazing sun Demi lost a willingness to continue the trip.\
  \ I still don`t know what exactly happend, she was really interested in this trekking\
  \ before. I let her come back with other adventure seekers and continued to walk.\
  \ \n\n\"Never stay alone in a Brazilian forest Polina\" - people told me a thousand\
  \ times. What I`ve done? Exactly that thing.\nWhen you are in such a magnificent\
  \ place, you forget about fears. I couldn`t believe that I`d done a half of trekking.\
  \ There was a breathtaking view of wild nature on the one side, and famous Brazilian\
  \ beaches, which are always full of people in summer, on the other side. Worth it!\n\
  \nSomewhere among the clouds I met a guy (Luiz), who asked me to continue to climb\
  \ with him without any equipments. I felt braveness and confidence, so my answer\
  \ was \"yes\". I will never forget that moment, because I could fall down. Do you\
  \ remember my story about the sneakers? Yes, you`re right, I lost the second sole,\
  \ when I was trying to climb to the top of this huge mountain (I`m so lucky). \n\
  \nI realized that it was impossible to climb, but also that I had no idea, how to\
  \ come back to the ground. I was hugging that mountain as it was my first love and\
  \ crying, because my legs were somewhere in the air. That situation reminded me\
  \ the song \"I beleive I can fly\". Thanks God, that Luiz was near by me and knew\
  \ what to do. He took care of me as I was a crying baby. To be honest I`m still\
  \ alive just because of him. \n\nThe trip has opened my eyes. It`s important to\
  \ do want you want in your life, but the main thing is how to do it. You can always\
  \ reach a goal, but it`s better to be well-prepared. So I wish you to be brave and\
  \ curious during your adventure time, but with two shoe soles at least ;)"
