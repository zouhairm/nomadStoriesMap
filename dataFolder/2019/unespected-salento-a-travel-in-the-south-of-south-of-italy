Text: "I\u2019m sitting outside in the sun, surrounded by old man playing cards. I\u2019\
  ve ordered an espressino, a sort of little cappuccino, to accompany my puccia, a\
  \ local bread speckled throughout with black olives. I\u2019m in Salento, in the\
  \ southernmost part of the Heel of Italy. Salento itself remind me of a big chunk\
  \ of bread dunked in seawater. And bread here comes in many forms, each imbued with\
  \ meaning. \nI discovered a local songwriter, who defined Salento like a frisa.\
  \ Frisa is an hard bread, with secular history, to taste it you have to wet it with\
  \ water and then simply accompany with sweet red tomatoes and olive oil. Taralli,\
  \ frisa, puccia \u2013 homemade o direct from the local bakery- earthly solid, or\
  \ soft as a baby\u2019s cheeks, are a staple here, bestowing pleasure to the hungry\
  \ visitator. For local people they are also a reminder of the ingenuity of ancestors\
  \ who struggled in the hard conditions of the countryside.\nSalento is also women\
  \ sitting on the doorstep, keeping company during the hot evenings. This is a land\
  \ of little villages, with architecturally unique historic centers, each a treasure\
  \ to visit. Many churches and buildings are constructed of Lecce sandstone, a stone\
  \ that magically catches the light. I lost myself looking up to faces, flowers,\
  \ leaves, angels, demons, sculpted by the shadows. Taking a walk, you can find a\
  \ Bar Sport. Usually they aren't simply bar, but relics of the past. Every Bar Sport\
  \ hides an emigrant\u2019s story: people who left seeking work elsewhere but have\
  \ come home again. It seems to me that this is true today as it was in the past.\
  \ I met many young people who went to study abroad but they have returned. They\
  \ are strongly attached to their Salento roots.\nIt\u2019s these young people who\
  \ are keeping up traditions with a new approach: in Salento you can find a lot of\
  \ little farms developed with a particular respect for the environment. I found\
  \ in a news-stand a good guide to discovering these places: \u201CGuida Salento\
  \ Km0\u201D, edited by a young group, engaged in the enhancement of organic agriculture.\
  \ Following their indications you can do a travel into the real taste of this territory,\
  \ respectful and unexpected.\nYou could get around by car, or bike, or, if you like,\
  \ by train. Taking the train of Sud Est railway, from the main station of Lecce,\
  \ is an adventure itself. The rail road is almost 100 years old and covered a huge\
  \ part of this little territory, connecting many of the villages. Trains are often\
  \ old and slow, but they are a perfect opportunity to cross the various landscapes\
  \ of Salento to see stone walls, olive trees, flowers, red earth and empty spaces\
  \ under the wide sky. \nSalento is also the land where the sun rises over the sea\
  \ on the east side and sets on the west coast. In less than an hour you can cross\
  \ from one coast to the other and take in the different energies of the sun. In\
  \ summer you can find some place, on the west coast, where people clap grateful\
  \ to the sun dying into the sea. Every evenings is full of parties on both coasts,\
  \ but if you want to revel in an authentic part of this spirit, you have to find\
  \ dance hall or reggae night. From the 1980s this music has become the most important\
  \ artistic expression in this south of the south. Sud Sound System is the most famous\
  \ band.\nThis land is full of artists: photographers, painters, sculptors, writers,\
  \ filmmakers and especially musicians. While it\u2019s famous for the traditional\
  \ pizzica, you might be surprised at the different other kind of music there are-\
  \ from jazz to metal- which give sound and soul to this fascinating land.\nIn the\
  \ authentic Salento the true richness is transforming the power of landscape into\
  \ food, vibrations, good life and, above all, sharing. Earth, sea, wind are the\
  \ main characters in this land. If you take them in with curiosity and a mind open\
  \ to learning, you will find your own story to live, in this southern treasure of\
  \ Italy."
