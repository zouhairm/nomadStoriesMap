Text: "I grew up in a world where travelling, or seeing anywhere outside of the Maritimes\
  \ was a rare thing, once in a life time thing. Could never afford it, my family\
  \ lived a paycheck to paycheck lifestyle, no point in dreaming about London or anywhere\
  \ for that matter. But I did anyway, I dreamed of London, and travelling most of\
  \ my life. The words \"Keep on dreaming\" kept being the response, like it would\
  \ never happen. I wanted something different than my family situation, I wanted\
  \ freedom of my own. A London full of possibilities and lame humor, my breath to\
  \ be swept away by architect and city chaos. Movies, TV shows and books were all\
  \ I had, also many youtube videos, I must confess. I annoyingly always said, getting\
  \ to London was my one big dream, no matter what happened over there, or in between\
  \ getting there. When I was 18 I moved out of my parents house, into the little\
  \ city close by and started saving. Alberta, however was where I made most of my\
  \ money and my final decision. When I got everything in order, visa, plane ticket\
  \ all that jazz I made the jump and left everything I had in Canada, family, boyfriend,\
  \ job, cats, and social anxiety, and jumped into a world I longed for. I was home\
  \ sick for a place I never been too. \nIt was a terrifying, hectic, amazing thrill\
  \ and lasted 18 months all together of a lot of up and downs! There were so many\
  \ ups and downs! Getting my first job in a pub when I first got there, having to\
  \ pay 170 pounds a week for my rent!! Luckily my paycheck was roughly 180 a week\
  \ or so, and I had enough savings back home to last me a while. I had mental breakdowns\
  \ while I was over there. I even ended up going back home for a couple months to\
  \ deal with some of them. But went back and ended up in the South  Downs national\
  \ park for most part of my visa. Working in a small pub/inn called the White Horse.\
  \ We lived in the staffed housing the middle of nowhere, but it was where I fell\
  \ in love with hiking, and a certain person. The first part of my stay in England\
  \ was in London in a pub called the Half Moon where they played live music almost\
  \ every night. There's so many stories I can tell from the past two years, so much\
  \ drama from both places I worked at across seas. I'm sure I'll share a few in the\
  \ future. \nVisiting other countries while you're in the UK is so much easier as\
  \ well, I saw the Vimy Ridge memorial, a must see for Canadians, the story I have\
  \ for painting the picture of how I arrived there is amazing. And I can still remember\
  \ it like it was yesterday. I also got to see the Swiss Alps, many Italian and Spanish\
  \ cities. I accidentally walked into the fanciest place I've ever eaten in Oslo,\
  \ explored the upstairs in the events rooms and snuck a picture of myself in a tall\
  \ mirror with the intention of me returning to that restaurant in the future. I've\
  \ been to a couple countries, yet I still want to see more. I did that one big childhood\
  \ dream, now what? But how I view travelling isn't the same, I'm sitting in my apartment\
  \ back home thinking about the next big travel adventure. I don't want touristy\
  \ things, I dont was leisure. Before I wanted to go somewhere, just to say I've\
  \ been there. Now, I want to travel and learn something. Do something that could\
  \ help change society and the way people think. Engross in the culture, learn new\
  \ ideas. Find new stories within every person I meet. Volunteer, clean oceans, see\
  \ wildlife, protect them. Continuously finding my story over and over. Discovering\
  \ the worlds many stories, even through my social anxiety became my passion."
