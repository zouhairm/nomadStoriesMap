Text: "The train is cold as ice but the wagon gets promptly filled by Indian blood,\
  \ warm hearts and popcorns fried in soybean oil. The phenotypes are well defined:\
  \ the range of skin color goes from a light brown to a deep shining black; and these\
  \ ones are sometimes chubby and have either a wide thick moustache or a thin curly\
  \ one. Every of them captivate my mind with their externals differences but I know\
  \ that as humans, we are all the same. \nThis Khajuraho-Orchha train barely moves,\
  \ every mile it\u2019s an adventure of tramping and every stop a replacement: travel\
  \ bags are now curious unquiet black-eyelined kids that sit upon the old upper bunks:\
  \ this is the cheaper wagon, every square it\u2019s taken by sited humans or luggage\
  \ and there is no place for laying down nor breathing properly.\nI had bought in\
  \ Pushkar a Marguerite Duras book but it\u2019s hard to read and understand the\
  \ dispossessed and ascetic prose of the femme de lettres: time, up here, is like\
  \ a tapioca vegan cheese, tense, viscous and mutant. The backpacker Russian couple\
  \ that is sited aside me barely speaks: she is feverish and numbing; he is cold\
  \ as Siberia, maybe overwhelmed by train delays (three hours, just this one) or\
  \ maybe he has set up a defensive wall to protect himself from the few persistent\
  \ greedy Indian fellows that want to take you in tuk-tuk to anywhere, or into a\
  \ tour package at a remarkably exorbitant price.  So when I have heard him laughing\
  \ while he saw the gentle embraceable children climbing to the upper litters, those\
  \ soft foam rubber kids with elegant trousers or colorfully dresses, I understood\
  \ that there was life beneath the ice, that there was a tropical submarine life\
  \ of pierced corals, electric jellyfish and dolphins that speak in English. \nForty\
  \ miles and counting. The distance that has been leagues or imprecise signs now\
  \ is google maps. But the satellite cellphone precision it\u2019s just maths, it\
  \ can\u2019t tell us anything about subjective perception of space/time: if sometimes\
  \ long accountable meditations \u2013as writing or reading\u2013 are perceived as\
  \ a quick blink, going through another simple event is like dragging like a fugitive\
  \ slug that escapes from the sodium chloride that the on call housekeeper spread\
  \ for chasing it, for protecting her/his unspoiled home floral and plant arrangements.\
  \ \nWe are practicing patience, I read somewhere while travelling or I might wrote\
  \ it down myself, in fact it doesn\u2019t matter: who cares about the genealogy\
  \ of the tout \xE0 fait appropriate sentences that we should attribute to the human\
  \ genre. Furthermore, this is India. So patience between frayed bags, imitation\
  \ leather jackets and the Russian woman that takes Paracetamol with mineral water.\
  \ Patience when the whole world immobility asks me for interior silence. Patience\
  \ before my brain crashes in the Boredom Kingdom\u2026\nSuddenly, a joyful interminable\
  \ mantra starts flowing from an old archaic radio, tuned by a simple Hindu in his\
  \ fifties. He was looking at us while he was resting his head over the window but\
  \ without grabbing our attention or talking, like a respectfully and humble host,\
  \ ready to help some foreign really odd-strange buddies that would be staying in\
  \ his cheap \u2013yet honorable\u2013 Indian guesthouse.\nSo I grab the thread of\
  \ the mantra and submerge in an auto-guided meditation, following the flow of my\
  \ breath and raising the Kundalini energy up the spine to the third eye, and lowering\
  \ it, in a resting and pleasant cycle. At the very moment, another Indian opens\
  \ a window and oxygenates the flawed ambiance. Time, unexpectedly, begins to flow\
  \ in parallel with the satellite predictions. \nAnd when I finally open my eyes,\
  \ we are arriving. And to come out we have still to get across the river of dormant\
  \ people that have accommodated in the corridors, with the diligently help, bien\
  \ s\xFBr, of the still awaken Indians, including the radio\u2019s man, the unforgettable\
  \ and careful Indian that my memory will always delignate with acuity as I remember\
  \ the cheerful kids, the cold and heat Russian couple, the old smelly seats and\
  \ the heroic coming out of the motionless Khajuraho-Orchha train ride over the back\
  \ of a mantra."
