Text: "December exams mark the end of a semester, tiring nights, sleepy mornings and\
  \ loads of headaches. January, a new beginning, what would anyone want? To be away\
  \ from all the hustle and the monotony it brought.\n\u201COur seats have been confirmed\
  \ and hotels booked, we are leaving on fifth\u201D\nPapa told me this on a telephone\
  \ conversation and I could not believe as he did mentioned about having a break\
  \ few days ago but I wasn\u2019t sure if he was actually planning to have one. Filled\
  \ with delight, I started to pack my essentials as it was only a five nights and\
  \ four days trip. At that point in time, I was just excited about going, why? I\
  \ didn\u2019t know. Although, at the back of my mind, I knew what I wanted but somehow\
  \ things weren\u2019t coherent. \nSri Lanka! We were off to Sri Lanka.\n Hour before\
  \ the landing, I peeked down from the window and for a moment or two, I was held\
  \ back by something static. Down was a vast expanse of ocean and to my utmost surprise\
  \ there was something beautifully glistening upon the water, but it wasn\u2019t\
  \ moving, it was just there, motionless. \u201CI think its garbage in the water\u201D\
  , \u201CThis couldn\u2019t be ice, but it\u2019s so white\u201D came the speculations\
  \ from the passenger seats behind us. I was still looking down, gripped by the scenic\
  \ view when papa told me that those were waves, and we could see them as such because\
  \ we were at a height. It was a treat to my eyes, because it\u2019s usually buildings,\
  \ tons of houses but this, this was beyond reality for me. The waves, they were\
  \ still not moving. \nThe route from Airport to hotel, that was Colombo to Kalutara\
  \ was quite tiring and long, evening turned into night, merely in seconds. When\
  \ we reached our hotel, Tangerine beach Hotel, we were quite exhausted. After checking\
  \ in, we just lay in our rooms and then went downstairs for some dinner. I feel\
  \ that whenever I am out of my place, I lose my appetite but still wanted to have\
  \ some fresh air so we went for a la carte in the open area. I ordered a Shish Tauk,\
  \ and as usual failed to finish. The breeze was calming, I looked up at the sky,\
  \ and it was dark except for few stars twinkling sparsely. It was the first time\
  \ in my life that I was sitting beside the beach but unfortunately as it was night,\
  \ I could merely see the water which was gushing so rapidly. I just took a stroll\
  \ and walked to it just behind the boundaries. All I could do was to listen to the\
  \ waves. Closing my eyes, I took in all of it. At that very moment, I had never\
  \ expected to find myself at peace in a long time. This thought, refreshingly hit\
  \ me and I felt it in all of my nerves that had ached for tranquility. \nTo find\
  \ \u2018peace\u2019 at a place might seem insignificant to some but what blessing\
  \ it is might come as a surprise to many people out there. Life back at Lahore,\
  \ one of the busiest and liveliest city in Pakistan is so swift that it becomes\
  \ hectic and nerve wrecking to deal with even the petty of things. There is this\
  \ routine of waking early in the morning, ironing clothes, donning them in dizziness,\
  \ traveling to university, getting more headaches, returning to eat and sleep. Repeat.\
  \ \nThis place, where I stood was just opposite. No honking or harsh voices shouting\
  \ at each other. No lectures pouring out, assignments being gulped down, quizzes\
  \ being beaten up, midterms being panicked out and finals being flushed down. Also,\
  \ not to forget about some sets of people which could be blissfully avoided here.\
  \ \nThe next morning, as I walked through my room to the little balcony, I was stunned\
  \ to be waking up to something like this. The waves, as the tides had calmed down,\
  \ intelligibly danced in the golden of sunlight. Soothing, it was. After breakfast,\
  \ I went there because I had to. So near to that place so that my feet could touch\
  \ the glistening water."
