Text: "I am in one of the most vulnerable positions I have ever been, trapped with\
  \ a man who seems kind of crazy, and this might have been a bad idea.  \nWith odd\
  \ objectivity I asses my situation. I stretch out my legs on the passenger seat\
  \ of the enormous truck, bumping up and down as its springs adjust to the winding,\
  \ abandoned street of the Australian mountainside at night. The driver, Tom, short\
  \ but big with a boyish face, is the kind of man who has a lot to get off his chest\
  \ once you let him. The stories about him and his brother throwing burning spears\
  \ or knives at each other in duel-like games as children are rather harmless, but\
  \ the ones about his romantic life make me uneasy. That is what you get, entering\
  \ a strangers' vehicle just to reach Melbourne cheaply, I lecture myself. Yet, that\
  \ is not quite true. I longed for the experience to hop on and off someones' route,\
  \ using transport as a means to glimpse into their lives. So I listen, fix my eyes\
  \ on the road and ruminate over the likeliness of ending up in an episode of 'True\
  \ Crimes'.\n\"We're there\", Tom sighs eventually, with a voice that fits the eight-hour\
  \ drive we just finished. The vehicle comes to a halt at a gas station next to a\
  \ sleepy small town, illuminated too brightly for its absence of any sign of life.\
  \ In theory, I am going to catch a bus somewhere here. \n\n\"Yeah, no. You're not\
  \ catching anything here. Not tonight.\" The woman of about fifty at the counter\
  \ is obviously the kind who likes pulling off plasters in one go. She glances at\
  \ us warily and stems her hands on her hips as if adjusting to a firm stand helps\
  \ her to evaluate what she is seeing in front of her.\n\"No problem\", I throw in\
  \ lightly. \"I'll just walk through town to the next stop and wait for the first\
  \ one to come tomorrow morning.\"\n\"I don't think it's safe around here for you\
  \ at night, honey. There can be some shady guys outside\", is her second blow.\n\
  I am angry. Angry, that I have to trade independence for security, puzzled because\
  \ I don't know what to do about it, and above all, tired. And I know she is right.\
  \ \"You can sleep on the bed behind the front seats of the truck, I have to wait\
  \ here for the another driver until tomorrow anyway\", offers Tom.\nIt's the sum\
  \ of these acts of kindness that suddenly gets me. Not only had I a hugely interesting\
  \ ride while getting to know this man, but he basically encouraged me to loot his\
  \ little inbuilt fridge along the way. I step into his shoes and they feel worn.\
  \ He is not crazy, but he has a small cab for his wandering mind. There never was\
  \ any reason to worry.\n\nMy initial bringer of bad news vanishes into the kitchen\
  \ and comes back with a pen and paper. \"So we are here..\". The pen scratches over\
  \ the tiny sheet with a quick hand unbothered by neat standards, turning its emptiness\
  \ into a provisional map, including directions. \"Here is a breakfast diner to get\
  \ yourself something to eat, and this is where you take the first connection around\
  \ seven\", she finishes. Her face is now serious and attentive, searching mine for\
  \ evidence that I have understood everything she just explained. She hands me the\
  \ paper. \n\nAfter something resembling a rest in the truck, the sun rises and it's\
  \ time to part. I want to hand him a little chocolate treat I bought him along the\
  \ way. \"Just want to say thanks.\" \n\"Can't eat that. I have diabetes, you know.\
  \ Take it.\" Well, he is probably already full from that huge blueberry muffin from\
  \ the gas station he had. As I climb down the vehicle's stairs, he calls me back\
  \ for a quick hug. It feels kind of comical, but not out of place."
