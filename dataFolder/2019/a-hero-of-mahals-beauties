Text: "Finally I arrived at this famous Hawa Mahal in Jaipur city where this famous\
  \ back fa\xE7ade full of balconies that I only saw in postcard and TV now in front\
  \ of my eyes. I enjoyed my breakfast across to this hexagon balconies palace, this\
  \ magical palace really look amazingly pretty picturesque. After breakfast I tried\
  \ to walk around a few blocks to find the main entrance which is really hid inside,\
  \ queue for ticket entrance and make sure you keep the ticket as they will check\
  \ it again after you check out. Hawa Mahal had two large patio which is the center\
  \ patio has a water fountain which active everyday at 3 PM, no stairs in this palace\
  \ and only ramp if you want to climb to the tower, this palace shows a feminine\
  \ details of flowers and colors that remind me of a barbie dolls house, with the\
  \ earthy pink and cr\xE8me ambiance color, far away behind I have met this old guy\
  \ that made me really want to have a photo with him, and unbelievable unexpected\
  \ moment after we chat I found out he is the one who responsible for the restoration\
  \ of Hawa Mahal, means he is the head of contractor for Hawa Mahal, and for your\
  \ information he is also responsible for the restoration of all Mahals in Jaipur,\
  \ his name is Mr. Abdul, a humble person that instantly you can easily comfortable\
  \ to talk with and share ideas with him, in his simple appearance he is really a\
  \ famous contractor in India, he used a highly difficult technique to renovate this\
  \ Hawa Mahal which I found out most part already ruined and broken and mostly by\
  \ vandalism that I assume done by irresponsible tourists, and sadly to restore a\
  \ part of a handmade marble really took a crazy patience work and time consumed\
  \ as it made from marble powder mixed and the worker needs to set on the wall with\
  \ water and rub it with semiprecious stone until it smooth like marble, and magically\
  \ this marble really look like marble and also when you touch it keep cold even\
  \ though the sun really heat that time, very blessed that I can witness and learned\
  \ how to make this marble like, it\u2019s really a precious learning in my journey,\
  \ Mr. Abdul himself is very patience person and always make sure he restore each\
  \ part of this Hawa Mahal with traditional technique only, I have to worry how tourists\
  \ can vandalizing this beautiful heritage, so many things needs to be done to protect\
  \ this, I saw how they wrote on this heritage wall with no guilty at all and even\
  \ scratched this beautiful handmade marble heartlessly, Mr. Abdul said most part\
  \ of Hawa Mahal already newly renovated means what I saw mostly it\u2019s not original\
  \ made anymore, but you can still see the original marble in the main balcony which\
  \ is I saw government tried to put a protector line so nobody can ruined it, but\
  \ still it so difficult to educated people to respect this beautiful heritage, and\
  \ how a person like Mr. Abdul day by day restored and renovated it with his gorgeous\
  \ team. It was a truly precious moment to know Mr. Abdul. I didn\u2019t expect to\
  \ find that a simple old guy that I want to take a picture with is an awarded contractor\
  \ that renovated of all Mahals in Jaipur. I became a VIP guest of him for almost\
  \ half day and he showed me all parts of Hawa Mahal and I can easily in and out\
  \ the forbidden area which make me feel like a privilege guest ever. I really respect\
  \ Mr. Abdul so much, and I hope government can make some effort to educated local\
  \ tourist which I saw they didn\u2019t understand at all how to earn some respect\
  \ to heritage building, as I really love Hawa Mahal and wish this beauty still there\
  \ when I visit again, and hope they didn\u2019t lost the original part of Hawa Mahal\
  \ as it really precious and this is heritage historical building to the future."
