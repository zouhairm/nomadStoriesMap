Text: "\u201CMom, I\u2019m booking a one way ticket to Bangkok. See you in six months!\u201D\
  \ \n\nI was an 18 year old South African kid, besotted over adventure. I needed\
  \ to see the world from outside my sheltered home. \nTears rushed down my mother\u2019\
  s face as we parted ways at the airport, I was a big boy now, ready to see the world.\
  \ \nI walked out the airport and the buzz of \u201CThe East\u201D instantly captured\
  \ my soul. The smells of curries and spices, sounds of hooting \u2018tuk tuks\u2019\
  , sparkling city lights juxtaposed with the peaceful fisherman along the Chao Prae\
  \ River - all shook me into reality. I was miles from home for the first time, and\
  \ I was all alone.\nI was one of those minimalist travellers too, packing light,\
  \ cheap and living off the bare minimum. My budget was tight and I was going to\
  \ have make it last the next few months. My first meal was a bag of dried corn which\
  \ I continued to munch on all day.\nAfter scouring the big city for hidden gems,\
  \ treasures and temples, I was off on a 13 hour train ride north leaving from Hua\
  \ Lumpong station. Chiang Mai was the next destination. \nThe north of Thailand\
  \ is where I found moments of purest happiness and bits of my heart will always\
  \ be scattered in the ancient ruins of the old city. The cheap and tasty fruit stalls,\
  \ mouth-watering traditional rice dishes and effervescent culture drew me in more.\
  \ \nIt wasn\u2019t long before I made a few European travel friends at the hostel\
  \ and we exchanged our life stories. Lisa, Jim, Sophia and I began to explore the\
  \ enchanted Asian lands - temples, sightseeing and hours of painfully long taxi\
  \ rides. \nOn my 3rd day in Chiang Mai we plucked up the courage to rent scooters\
  \ and ride to a nearby waterfall. I was an eager novice driver with no past experience.\
  \ I also had rather less than average driving ability. The scooter ride started\
  \ and was going smoothly for the few seconds until the moment my breaks began to\
  \ stop working. I swerved out the way of oncoming traffic and found myself face\
  \ first on the Chiang Mai highway, with the scooter on top of me. The scars on my\
  \ legs and on my foot will forever remind me of that moment. However, this did not\
  \ hinder our adventure, I hopped on the back of another trusted traveller\u2019\
  s scooter and we continued to the \u2018sticky waterfall\u2019. We were all in a\
  \ hedonistic mind-set and nothing could dampen our spirits. The scorching hot and\
  \ humid Thai weather added to the experience. We reached the waterfall after driving\
  \ through miles of lush green rice paddies which was another tick off the bucket\
  \ list.\n The waterfall was magnificent and it had derived its nickname \u201Csticky\
  \ waterfall\u201D from the rough mineral rock deposits that are very easy to scale\
  \ up with the use of a couple ropes and trees. I was like a kid in a playground,\
  \ feeling freer than I had in years. This was the South East Asian adventure I had\
  \ been searching for, smiles of joy on every face. We engrossed ourselves in this\
  \ beautiful work of nature all day until it was time to scooter ride back to our\
  \ accommodation.\nThe day was coming to a close as my new found friends and I chatted\
  \ and laughed over our final dinner together, we all decided to try a Thai specialty\
  \ \u201Cpad kapow moo\u201D which had us all wanting more. In these finer moments\
  \ you begin to find life\u2019s greatest pleasures.\nThe magnificent thing about\
  \ travel is that you meet people from all over the world. Everyone\u2019s life decisions\
  \ had led them to that one exact moment in time where you all meet. \nEven when\
  \ you are a solo traveller you are never truly alone. Friendships are galvanised,\
  \ laughs are shared and individual growth takes place.\nMy friends and I shared\
  \ final goodbyes the next day and parted ways.\nThis one is for every soul I have\
  \ met and touched my heart along my travels, you are the beauty in humankind that\
  \ ,at the age of 18, I didn\u2019t expect to find."
