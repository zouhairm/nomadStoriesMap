Text: "The goat appears to be used to people staring at it curiously. That\u2019s\
  \ warranted. Dharavi, one of Asia\u2019s largest slums, surely sees no shortage\
  \ of people. This is where we stand.  The goat, perched lazily atop a pile of stained\
  \ and twisted plastic, gazes unfazed into my gawking face. It forms the outer edge\
  \ of a group, with two other goats perched on similar piles of plastic spread across\
  \ one of the thousands of alleyways spider-webbing across the slum. It\u2019s squinting\
  \ eyes push sideways into the corner of its sockets to inspect the new group of\
  \ noisy creatures invading its alley. The tour guide draws our attention and explains\
  \ that Islamic households keep goats for the better part of a year, ensuring the\
  \ animal stays healthy, after which it is killed, a practice that takes place on\
  \ Eid al-Adha, or \u201CThe Festival of Sacrifice\u201D. I look back to the goat.\
  \ It doesn\u2019t seem remotely concerned with this information and continues to\
  \ chew on the dry maize left in a steel bowl at its feet. The group begins to move\
  \ off down the alley, leaving me alone with the animal. I scratch the goat\u2019\
  s ear and silently wish it luck, and then I too hustle away, eager not to be left\
  \ behind, swallowed up by the slum. \nWe return to the bus, and back again to the\
  \ Hotel, another thousand experiences and stories radiating across my mind, to settle\
  \ in for another night of reflection and rumination. I think back on the past weeks,\
  \ travelling across India, delving into the culture, and forming a deep connection\
  \ with the people. \nMumbai, however, was an enigma.\n\nIt is quite an experience\
  \ to find yourself in a moment of complete and utter joy. A moment in which everything\
  \ but what is, is forgotten.  The focus becomes here, now, absolutely nowhere else.\
  \ When you snap into something inexplicable, and you become purely and wholly grounded.\n\
  That moment of pure joy. A feeling of senselessness. Of quiet chaos. I can still\
  \ feel it. I see the small notation on my phone everyday:\n\t\t\t              \
  \                                         \u201CThose on the roof of the West End\u201D\
  \nA warm night on the rooftop of the West End Hotel. Mumbai. The skyline glittering\
  \ all around, and we drank ourselves silly with gin from the bar in the lobby and\
  \ smoked cheap cigarettes. And we laughed, and I asked myself what it all means.\
  \ I felt that joy when it dawned on me that it doesn\u2019t have to mean anything.\
  \ And downed another cocktail and smoked another cigarette. How could I possibly\
  \ think of home? Or anything else for that matter? As far as I was concerned I was\
  \ right where I always both wanted and needed to be. Entrapped in bliss. And wonder.\
  \ Void of meaning or worry. And the horns honked in the streets below us, and the\
  \ gorgeous people giggled. And the cigarette smoke and laughter pushed out into\
  \ the Bombay smog. We went to bed at 3am and I laid awake and felt safe. The next\
  \ night would be our last, where we would all suffer in glee. But that is, I would\
  \ say, perhaps a story for another time. \nYou see Mumbai taught me something about\
  \ myself I never even thought to look within myself for. The senselessness ensures\
  \ a desire within me to accept myself, and love and nourish those I surround myself\
  \ with.The mad rush and ebb and flow of the city is what my mind moves to when I\
  \ think back on my travels. I was more grounded than I have ever been when I was\
  \ looking out across that twinkling skyline each evening. It was strangely intimate,\
  \ as if the city itself had stretched out and claimed me as one if its own. I imagine\
  \ Mumbai has quite that effect on many people. In those few days spent in that magnificent\
  \ metropolis, I was unaware of its power. I didn\u2019t know it then, but in a mere\
  \ 90 odd hours I had given my heart to Mumbai, and only realised the scale of what\
  \ that meant when I had left it behind, soaring out across the sky on my long and\
  \ arduous journey home."
