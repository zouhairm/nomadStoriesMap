Text: "The days getting slower and slower in the routine office of LG tower in Almaty,\
  \ Kazakhstan where I used to work for more than 1 year. Can you just imagine that\
  \ your days are not giving you anymore any colors as well as fresh breath of ideas\
  \ or even new emotions? I think this is an issue of XXI century, the concept of\
  \ fast life which people is facing everyday, I call it emotional burnout. Thanks\
  \ God, I have a my soulmate which is wild animal inside as me, and her name is Aika.\
  \ Aydana (me) and Aika(her) knew each other since University and it was love from\
  \ first sight, which has started with awkward compliments in order to build friendship.\
  \ But since we finished University, we have not speak much, due to separate lives.\
  \ \nAnd on the day X, when the air in the office was too extremely suffocating she\
  \ called me as she felt my state. And after \"hello\", there was no \"how r u\"\
  , it was just simply \"let's fly somewhere, i'm so tired\". Yes yes yes, somebody\
  \ heard me! Of course I will answer yes to Aika! What do you think? Yes we will\
  \ fly, and we fly as soon as we can. After that phone call we met on the lunch time\
  \ in tour agency (due to good discount, otherwise we would use skyscanner, airbnb\
  \ of course). And we sat in the tour agency office with no idea where we go. But\
  \ both of us, is in the tropical mood. And the agent said to try Goa, but both of\
  \ us heard that this place is kinda dirty and also it was piece of continent, and\
  \ our preferences were island life. Another advice was - Sri Lanka. I asked again,\
  \ Sri Lanka? Hmm... for sure we know it from history of geography classes at school,\
  \ but anyway what is Sri Lanka!? Where it is! And map shows that it is almost Equator.\
  \ And this is exactly where we wanted to be!\nSo after a long flight, we finally\
  \ reached this place, the warmth and humidity was just like milk to my skin. And\
  \ my eyes never seen so much green as here. But wait, ocean... I see ocean, I even\
  \  tried to swim in a ocean! God! life is wonderful and so perfect. The varieties\
  \ of flora and fauna here is just like you are in \"Jumanji\" movie. I can't believe\
  \ i saw so many birds, reptiles and peaceful pets on the beach. And those stories\
  \ about tsunami from local cute people which is so in good balance between their\
  \ culture and nature surrounded. \nAnd the other topic I would share it is natural\
  \ gems! Sapphires, rubies and other rare stones are mine there and exported all\
  \ around the world. And the story and place of Adam's peak! I truly believe that\
  \ first man in the religion came from Ceylon, otherwise this place is real Eden.\
  \ The way that local people just crawl palms in order to have free natural coconut\
  \ cocktail or small snacks as banana just shocked me in a good way. The simplicity\
  \ on how people get it from palms! \nAnd also the experience of a real jungle where\
  \ we need to be extremely careful and ready to meet worse reptile ever - crocodiles.\
  \ But this all was so catchy, cause we were thirsty for extreme and new emotions,\
  \ of course in instructed way. But yeah, the most emotional moment was for me the\
  \ surf balance on the water, and my first sledge of wave. I felt like I can everything\
  \ and i'm in a good friendship with water and nature around. People we met here\
  \ is just amazing! Such a diverse community, from different angles of world, here\
  \ I met a real friends who was also little insane and brave inside as us. \nAfter\
  \ 2 weeks spent in paradise, we were so sad to leave this place, we wanted to extend.\
  \ But it was new year eve and we need to go back to our families and work with a\
  \ new fresh head. This is trip was planned so good in my life path from a destiny!\
  \ Thank you life, you are wonderful!"
