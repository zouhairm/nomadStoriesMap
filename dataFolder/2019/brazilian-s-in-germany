Text: "I was living an almost one month at Germany and my friends said that we need\
  \ traveled to Cologne before comeback to Brazil, so we decided to go bye Flixbus.\n\
  Our first bus departures from Berlin to Cologne and we almost lost it!! We was at\
  \ the S-Bahn and we saw the time we had wasn't enough to arrive at the time, so\
  \ we get out and called a Uber - it was so expensive, I'll always remember it -\
  \ but we was at the central Busstation at time, just the bus driver almost killed\
  \ us, he fought with us in German and we just knew how say \"Entschuldigung\" what\
  \ means \"I'm sorry\", well whatever, when we arrived at Cologne, was a truly big\
  \ story just to find the S-Bahn, because the name was just \"tram\" and when we\
  \ found we took the first one to go to the hostel.\nAt the hostel we was at the\
  \ same room, 6 Brazilians at the same room, was a memorable night, we called to\
  \ a German friend that I have who live near this city and he comes to see us, than\
  \ we decided to go to a hip-hop club, but was quite boring, so we go out and start\
  \ come back to the hostel dancing and singing Brazilians songs - funk to classic\
  \ music -, so we decided teach this German guy how to dance \"Sarrada\", was the\
  \ most funny stuff ever!\nWell our first night was ending and everyone was so drunk,\
  \ so when we arrived at the hostel we just sleep. When we woke up in the morning\
  \ and we discovered out that if we give a Rating for the hostel on TripAdvisor we\
  \ won a coke per person, so we did and this was our breakfast! We start to see all\
  \ the tourist points in the city - important to say: Cologne is so beautiful and\
  \ happy, one of the most happiness cities I knew at Germany -, so in the end, to\
  \ take the bus back to Berlin, we almost lost it again, but wasn't our fault this\
  \ time! The trains was late, YES THE TRAINS IN GERMANY WAS LATE, I couldn't believe\
  \ it too, so we paid again an Uber, quite expensive again, but we need come back\
  \ to the German Institute at Berlin, so we didn't had a choice.\nAt the bus coming\
  \ back to Berlin we sat at the bottom of the bus and while we celebrated the victory\
  \ of Borussia (BVB) we spoke in Portuguese, everyone laughing and having fun, a\
  \ girl who was on the bench behind me, with a smile in her face, asked: \"hey, I'm\
  \ sorry, but I need ask, we're you from guys?\" And we answer everybody together\
  \ \"Brazil\", she laughed and said \"omg you're so Happy!\"! So we start talk to\
  \ her and tell her the stuffs we did at Cologne, like go to the \"Alles 1\u20AC\
  \ shop\" to eat lunch and dinner and walk for 8km by foot just to see all the city\
  \ in the minimum details. Was a memorable trip with friends I did at Germany and\
  \ now are like my family here in Brazil! \nWhen we was coming back to Brazil everyone\
  \ traveled to different countries, I traveled to Italy and Portugal in the flight\
  \ back and was amazing, another great 2 stories, but it's to the next time.\nThanks\
  \ to read until here and see you soon!"
