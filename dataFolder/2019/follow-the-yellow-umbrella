Text: "When you travel far, you have to make sure you\u2019re really making the most\
  \ of your trip. How you do that, however, varies from person to person \u2013 of\
  \ course there\u2019s no right method, each to their preference. To my mother, it\
  \ means going to as many places as you can with the amount of time/money you have\
  \ available. Yes, she\u2019s the kind of person that goes on those bus tours in\
  \ Europe that visits one country per day for 20 days\u2026 So it comes to no surprise\
  \ that on our first trip from S\xE3o Paulo, where we lived, to New York City, she\
  \ thought it\u2019d be a good idea to take a 5-day bus tour from NYC to Canada,\
  \ stopping at Niagara Falls, Montreal, Toronto and Ottawa, with accommodation included,\
  \ for only $99/person.\nThat\u2019s right, bus fare and hotels, all included during\
  \ 5 days for only $99 per person. If it seems too good to be true, it\u2019s because\
  \ it was. When we got to the bus meeting point in NYC\u2019s Chinatown, it became\
  \ clear this tour had a specific target clientele: Big Chinese families. So it was\
  \ that the first and only time I ever visited Canada, it was as part of those tourist\
  \ groups that follow a person holding a giant umbrella. Each one of us received\
  \ a pin with the tour company\u2019s logo; I still cherish mine as a memento and\
  \ reminder to never let my mom book trips for us ever again.\nIt can\u2019t have\
  \ been that bad, you might say. Well, think of long bus drives with Jackie Chan\
  \ movies as the only entertainment available. Think of old Chinese grannies sitting\
  \ next to you, chatting away in Mandarin and looking at you like they don\u2019\
  t really get why you\u2019re in a bus full of Chinese families (it\u2019s ok, at\
  \ this point you don\u2019t either). Or think how left out we felt that whenever\
  \ we passed by an important landmark, or just had to be informed of something by\
  \ our Chinese-American guide, it was about 5 minutes of Mandarin, jokes and questions,\
  \ followed by a simple \u201Cnext stop: Bathroom break\u201D (in perfect English,\
  \ I might add). \nAt least we still got to see some major Canadian sights, besides\
  \ Niagara Falls. I remember thinking how Toronto seemed very cultural, how Qu\xE9\
  bec\u2019s French sounded weird. How Ottawa looked boring (no offense to people\
  \ from Ottawa, we didn\u2019t really have time to explore), how Niagara Falls was\u2026\
  \ wet. One thing I wish I remembered was trying traditional Canadian cuisine for\
  \ the first time, maybe something like poutine? Unfortunately, all our meals were\
  \ in Chinatowns or all-you-can-eat Chinese buffets by the side of the highway. At\
  \ least I can now say I am a connoisseur of Montreal, Ottawa and Toronto\u2019s\
  \ Chinatowns, I guess. \nIf there\u2019s one thing this trip taught me, it\u2019\
  s that for me, personally, I\u2019ll just not remember anything of importance if\
  \ I visit more than one city in a short period of time. Also that Chinese grannies\
  \ really like candy and this will win them over (after a day or two of candy-sucking\
  \ and shared burps, they\u2019ll stop judging you and your Italian-Brazilian mother\
  \ for intruding on their holiday). Also: Jackie Chan is a beloved man in every culture\
  \ and amongst all ages."
