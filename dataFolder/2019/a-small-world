Text: "Certain places just seem to have a special magic attached to them. San Sebasti\xE1\
  n is one of those places. A friend from Couchsurfers recommended I add it to my\
  \ trip and I truly believe it was meant to be. \nOriginally, when I got off the\
  \ bus, I had a few worries about this part of my trip. \u201CWhy come to the beach\
  \ when it\u2019s supposed to rain?\u201D \u201CWhat am I going to do for 8 hours?\u201D\
  \nAs I was running from the beach to find cover from the rain, my first thought\
  \ was to go get tapas. Life had other plans. I ended up running into a choreographer\
  \ from France who was working on assignment here in Spain.\nA big part of a trip\
  \ like this is being open to people and the experiences that accompany them. I thought,\
  \ after Paris, that all this talk of \u201Cfinding\u201D one\u2019s self came from\
  \ isolation (a big part of the first leg of this trip). If you go back, you\u2019\
  ll see there was definitely a push/pull for me. Be alone and lonely or be with people,\
  \ but sometimes feel like you\u2019re missing out on the experience you deserve.\
  \ \nI\u2019ve come to the conclusion that you can do both.\nThe \u201Cright people\u201D\
  \ make it all better. There\u2019s no constrictions, no hesitations, or misgivings.\
  \ It\u2019s a genuine discourse between individuals that truly want to see how others\
  \ think. \nIt was whilst sitting eating Thai food, with French people, in Spain,\
  \ that I realized how small the world truly is. It\u2019s also when I began acknowledging\
  \ both the differences and similarities these places around the world seem to share.\
  \ Something I love about Europe, is that small talk doesn\u2019t exist. Today we\
  \ discussed our philosophies, politics, and everything in between. These are people\
  \ I just met! Still, time nor language barrier seemed to perturb the connections\
  \ that were made today.\nThere are so many people in my life that I don\u2019t know.\
  \ So many people that are just happy staring at the labels of my packaging; never\
  \ really hoping to move past that. I don\u2019t think that\u2019s my style. Moving\
  \ forward I\u2019m trying to not only account for when it\u2019s happening to me,\
  \ but also when I\u2019m doing it.\nYou can\u2019t window shop or check the serving\
  \ size when it comes to people!"
