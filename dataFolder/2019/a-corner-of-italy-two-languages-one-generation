Text: "The bedroom was dark, but I was laughing out loud as the note that Nicola had\
  \ tapped to the outside of the bedroom door was slipped back under by his boisterous\
  \ friends in the next room, who were trying to inspire us to join the party. Even\
  \ though I understood none of the Italian I watched with amusement, the solo member\
  \ of the audience, as Nicola rose again from his bed to have a passionate word with\
  \ his friends.\n\nIt was my first night in the college apartment in Udine, Italy.\
  \ When I discovered my train route ran through the home town of the young Italian\
  \ I\u2019d met in Scotland that summer I arranged to visit at the last minute. What\
  \ I didn\u2019t realize was that I would experience that little corner of Italy\
  \ with about half a dozen young Italians.\n\nSerendipitously Nicola had his mother\u2019\
  s car with him. Slightly apprehensively I buckled into the passenger seat the next\
  \ morning, not sure what to expect of Nicola\u2019s driving. There was no need to\
  \ worry though. The worst part was that the passenger seat belt had lost its red\
  \ release button, so every time we got out I had to wait for Nicola had to unbuckle\
  \ me!\n\nUnbuckle though we did at the town of Venzone with Nicola\u2019s friend\
  \ Dillon. In English the two of them explained to me how the Cathedral had been\
  \ studiously photographed and documented for inclusion as a World Heritage Site\
  \ 4 decades earlier. Just weeks after the photos a massive earthquake and aftershock\
  \ nearly leveled the whole town. Walking beneath the vaulted ceilings I looked at\
  \ the raw, grey stone walls with patches of plaster remaining, in awe of the people\
  \ who had laid out, marked, and reassembled every stone of the Cathedral exactly\
  \ where it had previously been in the years following the earthquake. \n\nNicola,\
  \ Dillon, and their other friends shared a level of historical knowledge that would\
  \ have put most any American college student to shame. Perhaps it was because these\
  \ young men were either studying to be teachers, or tour guides. \n\n\u201CIf you\
  \ want to have a research job most people go to another country because there is\
  \ no opportunity, or money for that here.\u201D Nicola\u2019s roommate Lorenzo told\
  \ me that evening. \n\nLike young people anywhere though concerns about the future\
  \ can be set aside. As a large dish of assorted seafood was placed on the linen\
  \ table between wine glasses it was clear the earlier thoughts on finding something\
  \ cheap for lunch had gone by the wayside. The cream colored umbrellas were still\
  \ shading the tables outside the restaurant, however the tourists had left the seaside\
  \ town of Grado for the season meaning Nicola, Lorenzo, another friend and myself\
  \ had the street front view entirely to ourselves.\n\n\u201CThis is the first special\
  \ meal for my birthday I have had.\u201D Lorenzo said with a mix of casualness and\
  \ pleasure. Was he really sure? Yes, he was. It alludes to the fact that perhaps\
  \ daily Italian cooking is so good it doesn\u2019t leave much leeway for \u201C\
  special\u201D meals. \n\nThat night though a big celebration had been planned in\
  \ the Venetian styled piazza. The American version of the birthday celebrations\
  \ would have involved quite a few cans of beer, but sophisticated as ever the Italians\
  \ brought bottles of wine, albeit with the contradictory addition of plastic cups!\n\
  \nOutnumbered 30 to 1 the language of preference for the night was Italian. Among\
  \ the young men were two other young women, both rather embarrassed about trying\
  \ their English. As the night wore on the air took on the coolness of fall. On the\
  \ walk back as the youngest girl began shivering I reached out to rub my hands up\
  \ and down her arms. Amazingly that was the key to unlocking her shyness.\n\n\u201C\
  They\u2019re useless.\u201D She said gesturing towards the men. I laughed inside.\
  \ How much she sounded like any woman.\n\nThe time to say goodbye came too soon\
  \ the next morning after our short night. I thought I owed a debt of gratitude to\
  \ my young Italian friends, but instead Nicola told me  \u201CThank you for reminding\
  \ me why I want to be a tour guide.\u201D"
