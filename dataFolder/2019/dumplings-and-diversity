Text: "\u201C Uh\u20268 um\u2026 shrimp and chive dumplings\u201D I said. As a west\
  \ coaster, I was unfamiliar with the speed of speech and movement that is so common\
  \ in tiny Chinatown dumpling houses, and in New York generally.\n  \n\u201COk ok,\
  \ 5 dollars, wait over there.\u201D The surly Asian woman pointed without looking\
  \ as she turned to drop the handmade pillows into one of the steaming pots. She\
  \ was flanked by towers of rising steam. The smell of hand-rolled dough mixed with\
  \ the aroma of chicken, pork, cabbage and mushroom was like a spirit taunting everyone\
  \ in the room until their food arrived. Only $5, how could such a deal still be?\
  \ Had I stepped back in time? Was the Archduke of Austria still alive? Was Elvis\
  \ still alive and thin?\n\nThe wait was short, maybe 5 minutes, but it felt like\
  \ forever, partly because I\u2019d walked from the Staten Island Ferry in the cold\
  \ to get these, and also, I knew how satisfying these dumplings would be. I was\
  \ a 7-year-old again, waiting all Christmas Eve for the Nintendo 64 I knew was under\
  \ the tree.\nAs the wait ticked by, the line grew. People\u2019s lunch dreams began\
  \ to manifest themselves; their grumbling bellies needed to be satiated. The crowd\
  \ was diverse, unexpectedly so being in the heart of Chinatown. The ages fluctuated\
  \ as the line snaked from the register across the shop to the front door. You had\
  \ the regulars, older Asian couples who came both out of habit and for the food.\
  \ Their orders were rung up and started without words exchanged. A tall, dapper\
  \ man in a striped button down and wool overcoat was picking up a to-go order. My\
  \ guess is he had to return to his high-rise office and yell things like \u201C\
  BUY, BUY, BUY\u201D and \u201CSELL, SELL, SELL\u201D into a phone. A group of large\
  \ construction workers who were working on the nearby park come in wearing steel\
  \ toe boots, yellow caution vests, and tattered jeans. They spoke a mix of English\
  \ and Spanish and somehow my two years of not paying attention in high school Spanish\
  \ prohibited me from understanding them. I assume they ordered a mountain of dumplings.\
  \ Also, a young Indian couple stood near the door, displaying all the awkwardness\
  \ that accompanies learning to date, the gawky glances, start and stop conversation\
  \ littered with umms and ughhhs.  \n\nThe line of people in that shop represented\
  \ how different this city was from most others and exemplified the diversity that\
  \ underpins this country. Other cities I\u2019ve lived in or visited--Phoenix, LA,\
  \ Seattle, San Francisco--people stay within their neighborhoods, choosing to surround\
  \ themselves with people who share a frightening level of similarity to themselves.\
  \ People who make about the same amount of money, have the same political view,\
  \ are of the same ethnicity; people choose to live in more and more segregated environments.\n\
  \nNot New York-- neighborhood boundaries do not exist to entomb those that most\
  \ match the collective makeup of the area while keeping all others out. These borders\
  \ are permeable membranes, through which people, culture, food and a collective\
  \ love for the city flows.    \n\nOnce my dumplings arrived the remaining restraint\
  \ I had vanished, I popped a still steaming one into my mouth, searing my uninitiated\
  \ tongue."
