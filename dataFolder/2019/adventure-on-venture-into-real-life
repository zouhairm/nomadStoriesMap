Text: "I am an engineer,preparing for my highers after taking a break in my professional\
  \ life.In these years I had seen many phases of life,be it good or bad or boring\
  \ or exciting to which now I feel a lot replenished and refresh as if I was in matured\
  \ then.Nonetheless I had trusted persons a lot than they deserved to which I got\
  \ hurt.I absolutely don't blame anyone rather I felt thankful to finally know my\
  \ myself and realised I too have the wings to fly,to fly long and see ,explore our\
  \ beautiful mother Earth.I took a break from everything and went to South India.I\
  \ got quite intrigued and also mesmerised to see the beauty nature has bestowed\
  \ on us.The Sunrise on Ooty hills is spellbound admist of cloud.Its coffee and chocolates\
  \ are awesome.Gokarna on North Karnataka is for sure a beach destination.Om beach\
  \ and kudle beach are amazing.I just sat down their on the sands enjoying wind and\
  \ witnessing beautiful blue waves touching my feet.Beach for sure is my happiest\
  \ place.I enjoy art, architecture, museums, churches and temples; anything that\
  \ gives me insight into the history and soul of the place I'm in. I can also be\
  \ a beach bum - I like to laze in the sand or float in a warm sea at sundown.With\
  \ the sky above, sand below peace comes within and then I realized salt water heals\
  \ everything.Theres nothing more beautiful than the way the ocean refused to stop\
  \ kissing the shoreline nomatter how many times it's being sent away.I just wanted\
  \ to thank ocean for making me humble,tiny, inspired and salty all at once.. Kodaikanal\
  \ (also known as Kodai) is one of the most fascinating holiday destinations of South\
  \ India. Nestled in the upper Palani hills of the Western Ghats, it is a misty hill-station\
  \ with mesmerizing scenic beauty, spectacular viewpoints, lakes and waterfalls enables\
  \ tourists to experience various things to do in Kodaikanal.From wilderness camping\
  \ to trekking routes, from museums to gardens, waterfalls and lakes, one can have\
  \ more things to do in Kodaikanal than any other hill station in this part of India.\
  \ Stroll along the hilly roads and pine forests, take a bicycle ride along the lakeside,\
  \ sail along the pristine lakes or simply be delighted by the view.I also visited\
  \ Ooty which is a popular tourist destination and offers travellers a range of things\
  \ to do. From checking out the local markets to visiting the lakes and waterfalls\
  \ and even eateries, there is a lot of scope for fun during your stay here.Whether\
  \ you\u2019re visiting this peaceful hill station for a weekend getaway or for a\
  \ longer break, you can\u2019t go back home without trying the chocolate and coffee\
  \ and soaking in the beautiful surroundings.I went to Kunnur too.Something that\
  \ everyone, including travel buddy, recommends is taking the toy train called Nilgiri\
  \ Moutain Railway. Obviously it\u2019s not really a toy but I guess it\u2019s called\
  \ one because of the novelty factor. It starts from the town of Mettupalayam, which\
  \ is just before Kunnur and goes all the way up to Ooty. Travel buddy says that\
  \ for a while when the train is moving uphill, it travels so slowly you can get\
  \ out and walk beside it.The road to Kunnur is so scenic, you want to make sure\
  \ you stay awake all through the journey. Especially if you\u2019ve decided to travel\
  \ first thing in the morning like us. Right after an early breakfast at Annapurna\
  \ in Coimbatore, we hit the road. We drove past fields of curry leaves and beetle\
  \ nut trees, and as we entered Mettupalayam, the sight of the Nilgiris on the horizon\
  \ cloaked in a thin layer of fog all made waking up at the wee hours of the morning\
  \ worth it.Something I learnt from my mini South trip is We live in a wonderful\
  \ world that is full of beauty, charm & adventure.Collect Moment, Not Things. We\
  \ travel not to escape life, but for life not to escape us."
