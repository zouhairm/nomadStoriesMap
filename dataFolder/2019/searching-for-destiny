Text: "I felt lost. I was going thru the motions in life, no sense of purpose, I felt\
  \ like what I was doing every day didn't matter and I wasn't going anywhere. \n\
  \  One day, I was so desperate for a change, that I got online and started searching\
  \ the internet for an answer, an opportunity. \nI came across YWAM, youth with a\
  \ mission. They had a base in Hawaii and they had a program for people interested\
  \ in photography and mission work. Yes, this was it!  My eyes got bigger, my heart\
  \ got excited. I was going to go, I had to go. \n  Over the next few months I made\
  \ all the necessary preparations for my journey, filling out the paperwork, fundraising\
  \ and saving the money. April 6, 2011, the day was finally here and I had my bags\
  \ packed! \n  I got on the airplane, not knowing really what the next 6 months of\
  \ my life had in store for me. Landing in Hawaii, surrounded by young people, like\
  \ me, who had a desire in their heart for something more. I was overwhelmed by it.\
  \ \n  Hawaii was so beautiful, this place, the community of people here, was oozing\
  \ with significance, what I had been searching for.\nThe three months in Hawaii\
  \ was amazing and a struggle all in one. My introvert self wanted nothing more than\
  \ to be in my own turtle shell, safe, protected. There was so much new, I left everything\
  \ that was comfortable with my old life. It didn't challenge me but I was safe there.\
  \ This was all challenge, yet I wasn't sure how safe it was. I took advantage of\
  \ every opportunity I saw. I went swimming in hot springs, hiking thru a jungle,\
  \ Stargazing on the mountain top, camping on the beach. I had so many wonderful\
  \ experiences. \n  We had a team discovery day planned out for us by our leaders\
  \ that led us on a fun scavenger hunt. At the end we would discover who our team\
  \ was that we would be traveling with overseas. We had a team of 5 girls and 2 guys,\
  \ 1 of the guys, David would be our leader in the Philippines for 3 months! \nThe\
  \ day before we left for the Philippines there was a strange interaction that happened\
  \ between me and one of the girls. It was over something small like returning someone's\
  \ keys to them, but the way she talked to me was not kind, it was off, like she\
  \ was irritated with me already. I remember thinking I don't want to go on a 3 month\
  \ trip with this girl. I found David our leader and sat down to talk with him. He\
  \ was able to comfort me and I decided that I was just being emotional and that\
  \ tomorrow would be better so I went back to my room.\n  The next 3 months in the\
  \ Philippines were some of the hardest months. The four other girls had paired off\
  \ and I was left really without a friend. Most of the time they treated me ok but\
  \ I felt separated and I longed for friendship that I didn't have on my team. Depression\
  \ and feelings of rejection became a very real part of my daily life. The food was\
  \ different and not always enough, the showers were sometimes out of a bucket of\
  \ cold water, and the beds were mostly mattresses on the floor with 4 others lined\
  \ up next to yours. I didn't have any privacy, I didn't have any comforts and I\
  \ didn't know how to cope. \n  Our last week we rented a house just for our team\
  \ and I spent most of my time in my room, watching movies, writing, trying to process\
  \ the last 3 months of life and pent up emotions. When we came back to Hawaii to\
  \ graduate from the program I still never really found reconciliation with my team\
  \ mates. I came home wondering what happened.. Life can be difficult but I realized\
  \ how important self care and open communication is. You can't pour out of an empty\
  \ container and you can't work thru issues unless you have the courage to address\
  \ them and to talk about them."
