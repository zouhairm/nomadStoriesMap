Text: "Something in the air is automatically different. It gives me a tingling feeling\
  \ in the pit of my stomach. My heart begins to beat faster, more curiously; although\
  \ my mind is oddly more at peace. I am home. This is what it feels like. This is\
  \ home. \n\nThere is an island vibe invigorating my whole body. The smells, the\
  \ sights, the sounds, everything excites me. As I pull up to my destination I can\u2019\
  t help but feel wonderment. The ocean breeze blowing, the sand conforming beneath\
  \ me, the mist of the sea caressing my skin. The people friendly, yet genuine, the\
  \ village rough but loving, the beaches vast yet inviting. As I walk along the beach\
  \ my skin is warmed by the Caribbean sun, my heart is full and my mind is free.\
  \ \n\nI thought, it couldn\u2019t get any better than this. I\u2019ve found my paradise,\
  \ I\u2019ve found my peace on earth. The sunsets, we\u2019re off to an adventure,\
  \ it\u2019s crab season, that means on a crab run we go. The breeze is cooler, the\
  \ moon is bright, the ocean is the soundtrack to our adventure. As a crab ran past\
  \ us we would capture it with a swift throw of a towel just as it was about to dissapear\
  \ into its hole. With a successful catch we added him to our bucket. The night was\
  \ coming to an end, our adventure priceless, laughs to live a lifetime, a story\
  \ to tell our grandchildren.\n\nBefore we got back, he pulled me to aside and told\
  \ me he was glad he got to experience this adventure... with me. I looked back at\
  \ him with surprised eyes and simply said, \u201Cuh/aw me too!\u201D I didn\u2019\
  t realize that this would be the beginning of our fate. A simple crab run, somehow\
  \ turned love story. Talk about a real island love story.\n\nThe next day I spend\
  \ avoiding the topic, not to make it awkward. I was still in lust over the island\
  \ breeze to consider anything... or anyone else. The day went by quickly, the sights\
  \ and sounds all blurred together after a long day filled with laughter, stories\
  \ and sightseeing. As night approached, my eyes heavy I fell asleep, little did\
  \ I know I would do one thing that would seal the deal. Call it fate, call it destiny\
  \ or just my Island Love Story. As I slept that night, unknowingly, I grabbed his\
  \ hand and held it close, I don\u2019t know why, I don\u2019t know how. But I slept\
  \ so peacefully. The next morning I didn\u2019t realize my actions had any impact.\
  \ But his heart now beat for me. I was now the apple of his eye. He knew I was the\
  \ only one for him. However, I wasn\u2019t convinced, I didn\u2019t even know what\
  \ I had done! He explained to me, when I held his hand, his heart was the fullest\
  \ it had ever been. He felt so warm and his stomach turned to knots, he felt overwhelmed.\
  \ He just knew. Skeptical to say the least, but I couldn\u2019t deny his feelings,\
  \ not after that explanation. \n\nFast forward, I still get the same feeling whenever\
  \ I touch down in this sweet island. But now, more than ever my heart is fuller\
  \ than I could\u2019ve ever imagined. The sounds, sights and smells excited me like\
  \ my very first time. My travels are evermore exciting now, because now every time\
  \ I hold his hand both our hearts swell, it\u2019s almost hard to breathe. Our island\
  \ love story unexpected, our journey continues and our story continues to write\
  \ itself. \n\nSomething in the air is automatically different. It gives me a tingling\
  \ feeling in the pit of my stomach. My heart begins to beat faster, more curiously;\
  \ although my mind is oddly more at peace. I am home. This is what it feels like.\
  \ This is home."
