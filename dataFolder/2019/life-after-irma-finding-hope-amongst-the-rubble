Text: "When I first met David and Sharon they were quite direct about their situation.\
  \  Life had dealt them a massive blow, and at this stage of their lives they felt\
  \ it was akin to a death sentence.  Now in their early 70\u2019s needing the assistance\
  \ of canes to walk, they had neither the means nor the ability to help themselves\
  \ out of the dire situation they were currently in.\n\nWhilst Hurricane Irma was\
  \ long gone from the island of St John, her effects were still being felt some seven\
  \ months later.  What had been lost was not merely homes; she had robbed them of\
  \ something far more important, and that was hope.\n\nChatting with them that day,\
  \ the pain and sorrow was etched all over their faces.  David, mostly silent, seemed\
  \ distant and withdrawn, at times staring off in to the distance. I wondered if\
  \ this was his natural demeanour or an ongoing effect of the severe PTSD I had been\
  \ briefed he was suffering.  Sharon took the lead.  Voice quivering and eyes devoid\
  \ of any discernible light, her expectations she said were \u2018nil\u2019. Their\
  \ fate she felt, had been sealed the day Irma came to town and the future lay before\
  \ them in a pile of rubble.   \n\nAs I wandered around the property with them, surveying\
  \ the monumental task at hand, I realised in that moment what it was that we were\
  \ actually doing here.  Having travelled thousands of miles from home seemingly\
  \ on a whim, it had taken four months, countless houses and a huge amount of soul\
  \ searching to arrive to this point.  Our job, or so I thought, was to clear away\
  \ debris and help sort through the destruction that Irma had left in her path. \
  \ When I signed on as a volunteer I had accepted the physical demands and I\u2019\
  d more than met the challenge.  Here I was now though, leading my last project,\
  \ and finally grasping the emotional impact our presence could have and the greater\
  \ need of those who were suffering.  It was the kindness and compassion shown that\
  \ would ultimately help heal moreover than any reconstruction we would do.\n\nOver\
  \ the course of the next two weeks our team worked tirelessly to find the remnants\
  \ of the life that David and Sharon once knew, high up on the cliffs overlooking\
  \ the stunning vista that is Coral Bay. Each day brought with it new challenges,\
  \ seemingly endless debris from the surrounding hills, and yet also a pure moment\
  \ of joy and happiness, helping to bolster the spirits of a weary crew.  A  kaleidoscopic\
  \ mosaic butterfly on concrete stairs, a happy turtle staring up at us from the\
  \ bottom of the pool floor or a stand alone pink flower surviving and thriving;\
  \ previously hidden under mounds of debris it gave us a glimpse into not only the\
  \ artistry of Sharon but also the love that had been present in the building of\
  \ their dream home.\n\nAs we worked each day to uncovered the remains of what was\
  \ left of the house, we started to witness a change in both David and Sharon.  Firstly\
  \ a smile here and there, next day a laugh, a spark in the eyes; subtle little reminders\
  \ that by simply showing up and assisting we were giving these two lovely people\
  \ all they really needed.  A reminder that someone cares and that in the end, when\
  \ all else that we have, all our possessions are gone, humanity is all truly matters\
  \ and what we can count on.\n\nStanding there on the last day I was content in all\
  \ that we had done for this lovely couple.  Whilst we may not have been able to\
  \ give them back the home they once had, we were able to walk away knowing that\
  \ they we had helped restore some hope, and that this was the greatest gift of all."
