Text: "Watching the sunrise 30,000 feet in the air is a view like no other.  I looked\
  \ at the pink sky from the plane window, the plane that was meant to reunite me\
  \ with my fianc\xE9. Life took a different turn however, and now the plane that\
  \ was meant to take me to someone I loved, was taking me on a joirney that I had\
  \ not planned. For the first time ever I was travelling overseas alone. \n\nI entered\
  \ my hostel in Scotland, apprehensive because I had never stayed in a hostel before.\
  \ Jet lagged and lonely I sat on my bunk and questioned my decision to use the plane\
  \ ticket. I went to bed early that night so I could get an early start the next\
  \ morning. \n\nBright eyed and bushy-tailed I began my adventure. Edinburgh in the\
  \ morning is beautiful. With a coffee in hand I strolled the empty Princes Street\
  \ Gardens, thinking to myself how nice it is to explore somewhere new before the\
  \ busy hours. I made my way through the city, exploring the alleys and secret courtyards,\
  \ taking the charm of the city in before the world woke up. \n\nWhen I returned\
  \ to the hostel I decided to take a break and charge my phone. A fellow hostel-goer\
  \ asked if he could sit with me and of course I said yes. We discussed our plans\
  \ for the day and discovered we both wanted to climb Arthur's Seat. He was planning\
  \ on going on a free tour of the city, and I decided I would join him. We started\
  \ the tour on the cobbled stones of the Royal Mile and made our way through the\
  \ Old Town of Edinburgh, while the tour guide revealed the secrets and stories that\
  \ make up Edinburgh's hidden history. The tour ended at the National Gallery, so\
  \ my new friend and I wandered through the portraits and landscapes of Scotland.\
  \ \n\nAfter this we headed to Arthur's Seat. It was a relatively short, but steep\
  \ climb to the top. Our timing wasn't intentional, but the sun began to set as we\
  \ climbed upwards. When we reached the top we were met with views that overlooked\
  \ the city of Edinburgh. The castle stood tall in the distance and the sky changed\
  \ to a blend of pink and purple. It was the perfect way to end the day. \n\nThe\
  \ next morning, a friend picked me up to begin a journey north into the Scottish\
  \ Highlands. It had been a dream of mine to climb the mountains that decorate Scotland's\
  \ Northen landscape. A year prior, I went on a two-day Scottish Highlands tour with\
  \ the same man who broke my heart a year later. The tour took us through Glencoe.\
  \ I remember looking at a specific Munro and thinking \"it's nice to look at, but\
  \ I want to know what it feels like be on top of that mountain.\" Ever since that\
  \ experience I had longed to go back. In an ironic twist of fate, life brought me\
  \ back to that same mountain. \n\nIt was winter so the climb was not easy by any\
  \ means. Snow and ice covered the 'Big Buichaille'. There were moments I was scared\
  \ and thought I wanted to turn back, but I kept going. After three hours of ascent\
  \ we made it to the summit. That moment, looking over the valleys and mountains\
  \ of Glencoe was incredible for me. I did it. I finally knew what it felt like to\
  \ be on top of that mountain. I knew in that moment that everything was going to\
  \ be okay. I understood that everything happened for a reason, and that the events\
  \ that had transpired, the good, the bad, the painful..they had brought me to where\
  \ I was, and they made me into the person I am today. My life had only just begun.\
  \ This unexpected trip inspired and encouraged me to brave a move across the ocean\
  \ to start a new life in the United Kingdom, where I am living today."
