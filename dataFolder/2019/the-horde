Text: "Being part of a long-distance relationship brings you to believe that every\
  \ little inconvenience during the long-in-between visits to your beloved one is\
  \ the fruit of the labor of some antediluvian divinity of unfathomable evil. \n\
  In fact, it is not unusual that the metropolitan service of Budapest gets interrupted\
  \ for a random reason, but even the trustworthy line 2? During my visit? Those Sumerian\
  \ gods\u2026\n\nIt was a summer night and thanks to the wonders of technology I\
  \ could find another way to reach the Keleti train station, proving that love indeed\
  \ wins over everything, including the Hungarian language barrier. I could not understand,\
  \ however, why there were so many police on R\xE1k\xF3czi street, with ambulances\
  \ popping out of an ever-growing crowd like mushrooms after the rain. \nA good while\
  \ later I could meet up with my girlfriend, and after making sure that we were not\
  \ in the middle of an anti-government protest we decided to investigate the origin\
  \ of such a pandemonium.\nWhat we found were many hundreds, thousands of reasons\
  \ for interruptions of traffic of all kind: the Keleti station was hosting a caravan\
  \ of migrants from the Middle East, the so labeled invaders, which embarked on a\
  \ journey across the Balkans and was skimming through Hungary, in hopes of reaching\
  \ a new home in the heart of Europe.\nIt is fairly easy to see migrants slammed\
  \ on television and on paper, shouted about and employed as tools of persuasion,\
  \ as pushes for political agendas and careers: a bunch of human beings which has\
  \ become not human, saloon gossip at best and fuel for discontent at worst.\n\n\n\
  It felt like a dense, dark mist of misery, like a wave suddenly crushing on your\
  \ chest and dragging you in the disorientation of a newly discovered emotion. We\
  \ started wandering in that pit of tired whispers and blank faces, trying to fully\
  \ grasp where and what we found ourselves in. We were walking among that dreadful\
  \ race of thieves and thugs, inhuman beasts bent on a holy war of mayhem, roaming\
  \ around like sheeps among wolves. Could this be the end of Civilization, screamed\
  \ with passion to the four winds by the local media? \nAmong the ominous chatter\
  \ which was filling the air, we could hear some loud thuds, like if something was\
  \ repeatedly hitting the floor, coming from the underground access.  It seemed like\
  \ there was some kind of agitation, although there were no police darting to that\
  \ position. It was not easy to find a spot where to lean from, but eventually we\
  \ got able to take a better look below.\n\nDisregard of the crushing ordeal, no\
  \ matter the hundreds of miles walked and the days of deprivation, a group of children\
  \ was playing football, with their parents around smiling and chit-chatting like\
  \ in any summer neighbor block party. Like shining stars in the blackest of the\
  \ skies, those kids were standing up and running, yelling, laughing, spreading all\
  \ around the unyielding feeling that everything was going to be all right. Home\
  \ was not just another word on the vocabulary anymore, but rather the very force\
  \ pumping life through the veins of all those faceless husks, an idea taken away\
  \ from these wandering souls and yet standing there, on the improvised football\
  \ arena of Keleti.\nI called out already my though luck for the metro jamming earlier,\
  \ but those antediluvian divinities managed to make that night of August warmer\
  \ than ever.\n\nThey were all gone by the following day, for theirs was just a brief\
  \ moment of respite. But their odyssey was finally getting close to an end."
