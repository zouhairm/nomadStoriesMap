Text: "Here I am, at a crowded train station going back to my hometown. I don\u2019\
  t want to return, but now I have no option. Can\u2019t afford my expenses here for\
  \ too long and the only reason I'm not losing this train is because the landlord\
  \ hit my door at five a.m. waking me up and demanding to pack and leave. Rude right?\
  \ Anyways, at least now I'm here in the train. The station is so ridiculously crowded,\
  \ why in the hell everyone decided to leave the city today at this exactly damn\
  \ time, it's not even weekend or a holiday. But personally I can\u2019t complain,\
  \ I just arrived in time and for my luck no one is inside this wagon, so I could\
  \ choose any seat in here.\n\nNow the train is finally leaving, finally. or sadly?\
  \ Since I don't want to return... It's not that my hometown is a bad place though,\
  \ it's just, going back feels like such a defeat. When I came I dreamed with new\
  \ friends and success, now I'm leaving with loneliness and failure\u2026 Actually,\
  \ more loneliness than failure, my life at this city felt just like this wagon,\
  \ big and empty, lonely.\n\nTired of watching the moving scenery through the window\
  \ after the train\u2019s departure, minutes later I left my seat together with my\
  \ backpack; on a walk, hoping to find a bar or a group of people somewhere. \u201C\
  I got to break this introvert behavior and mindset of mine, it leaded me to nothing.\u201D\
  \ It\u2019s what I strongly reaffirmed to myself while walking on the train. I passed\
  \ entered into another wagon, and the same setting as before I found: only an extensive\
  \ corridor ahead and no one on the seats. I continued to walk, entered into another\
  \ wagon ahead, and the setting was no different also. The same happened again, again,\
  \ and again. It was pretty much like the train had no end, or people in it. I stopped\
  \ counting wagons after passed entered twelve of them, and at this point things\
  \ felt super weird, \u201CThere is something wrong, why there is no one here? And\
  \ why so many wagons then?\u201D. The morning was cold, and when looking at the\
  \ windows you could only see a dense fog, together with some leaves and branches\
  \ trying to touch the windows in time to time.\nI sat into one of the empty chairs,\
  \ tried to use my phone but had no much success; it was turning on but the touchscreen\
  \ was simply frozen, plus: \u201CIs my phone clock wrong? The time it shows is exactly\
  \ the one It showed before I entered the train half an hour ago.\u201D \u2014 Right\
  \ after I took the train tickets out of my pocket, and when I read it not only my\
  \ town\u2019s name was blank but all timestamps ware the same as the time on my\
  \ phone, and in the train station\u2019s name that I departed from was written \u201C\
  Life\u201D. Confuse thoughts came on mind, but externally i had no reaction to what\
  \ i just read and imagined. \u201CWhen I woke up this morning I thought only my\
  \ abroad dream had ended, but now my life in general is over it seems\u201D I kept\
  \ my frozen facade while trying to think rationally about what was actually going\
  \ on, when suddenly heard someone frantically punching a door multiple times, and\
  \ when I looked around to see where the noise was coming from, I suddenly woke up,\
  \ in my bedroom at five a.m. with not a landlord but yes my mother, hitting on my\
  \ room\u2019s door, knowing that I had a job interview that morning.\nI never traveled\
  \ to anywhere, or lived by myself. Unfortunately my young adult life didn\u2019\
  t went as I planned when I was only a teen, and since things isn\u2019t going that\
  \ good, nightmares of me failing my plan of leaving my city haunts me every night\
  \ or so. But thinking again, I can\u2019t let fear steal my wishes and desires.\
  \ If I analyze, the dream I had was only a proof of where this negative mindset\
  \ I\u2019m living with is going to get me: in an empty train, departing from life\
  \ leading to nowhere."
