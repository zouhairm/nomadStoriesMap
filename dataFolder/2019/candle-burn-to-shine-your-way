Text: "Since my childhood, I was too talented in the field of music. All around me\
  \ noticed this, and they push me to develop my talent. When I was 19 years old,\
  \ I decided to travel to Belgium to present my country, Tunisia, in an international\
  \ cultural project named \"Nomad Youth\". The concept of this project is to organize\
  \ cultural events and festivals that mixes music, singing, media, dance, cynography,\
  \ which fights against racism. I met a lot of refugees, from sub-Saharan Africa,\
  \ Syria, Iraq, Pelastine ... each of them has its own history, its pains, its sufferings,\
  \ each one of them tries to preserve the smile to hide a pain. I wrote songs that\
  \ showcased their stories and shows their pains and I sang it before a large audience\
  \ in Rochefort-Belgium with the band \"Kameleon\".\nMaymoun: One day I took the\
  \ train to Liege. I felt that the path is too short. I was not satisfied, bacause\
  \ I had the desire to more please my eyes, because the landscape is too beautiful.\
  \ When I arrived in Liege, I was a little lost, I do not know the ways, but that's\
  \ the taste of adventure. I took a little walk in the streets of Liege, I was too\
  \ happy to throw greetings here, greetings there. People are too kind and smiling.\
  \ Well, I met the most beautiful Somalian girl, with her lovely smile, her funny\
  \ jokes, and her original hair, \"Maymoun\". She practices dance. Maymoun was a\
  \ member of our project. She is an 18-year-old Somalian girl, Maymoun was punshed\
  \ by her parents, especially her father, and went to Belgium to escape from this\
  \ suffering and begin a new life full of love, joy, justice and dignity.\nZekruallah\
  \ and Hasibullah: When I was in Rochefort I met a Belgian family who is having an\
  \ evening feast. They took me to play a football game, and there I met Zek and Hasib.\
  \ There are Twins who play Footbal in a team in the first league of Belgium. They\
  \ are too talented. Zek and Hasib are Afgans who suffered from terrorism that harmed\
  \ their country. They carry a pain in his hearts that push them to go to Belgium\
  \ and practice football and start a new life.\nMaryam : Violence, the vice that\
  \ harms all family relationships destroys a person's life. This is the case of Maryam,\
  \ a young Sin\xE9galienne who flees from the violence of her father. She was always\
  \ against the violence and injustice practiced against women. She was not convinced\
  \ of her situation, a mother and a father who are still in battle, yes a battle.\
  \ A battle that blew a lot of song and sank the tears of Maryam. So, Maryam decided\
  \ to wipe her tears and live a dignified life that respects the woman and that respects\
  \ the law. That's why she went to Belgium."
