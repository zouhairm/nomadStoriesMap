Text: "Wading the Porto rivers, exploring the suns that reigned from a rain swept\
  \ water stood a local. Impervious to the sun and chatter that clattered the surrounds,\
  \ she found herself talking to an Irish man awaiting a weekend in pastures newer.\
  \ \nShe stood in the warm air, hillside stretched, wiling and waiting, a man in\
  \ the light from the dark terrain, so peaceful and soulful. A language they shared\
  \ from the books they read, it was peaceful and soulful. Winding down to wine in\
  \ the in the barrios I called, savoured wines of Portugese hills so fair. \n\nWe\
  \ cared in each other a potential lover or a friend for a night, the warmth of the\
  \ air from the cool, strong night. The sounds of Vienna from a radio crooned, a\
  \ Scottish man singing of an unattained love, the city he read said everything for\
  \ him, as Porto did for me. Through the Rua Escura design, in time we kept track\
  \ of the streets which laid back a winery so finely traced the countries we placed\
  \ in symmetries Meditereanean lined. \n\nA paper lit fume shared the cigarette dream\
  \ over Bacalhau's salt, the flame of the paper furnaced the smell and taste of the\
  \ sea. Wanderers walked wondrously, waiting in tides and turns to step on the beach\
  \ they walked and waded. The water was calling in a star lit night, yet the two\
  \ walked through Rua das Flores as he placed a flower in her hair. That night they\
  \ flowered together through sheets and strides of cool smoked air tying together\
  \ in a mattress made linen luxury. A cigar coped cup covered their manners in a\
  \ manner that mattered to their synergy and symmetry. Rhetoric found phrases exchanged,\
  \ the Spanish flair shared this couple into the unknown where they held each other\
  \ in a sleep brought together for a night."
