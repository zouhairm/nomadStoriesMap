Text: "I looked at a handsome guy waiting for me right in the corner of arrival gate\
  \ Don Mueang airport. He seemed like worried, each seconds he glanced people who\
  \ just arrived. I smiled and waved my hands, I was sure, noticed him, ya it\u2019\
  s him, Johan, the one who would be my travel mate. He smiled back and approached\
  \ me. Then we left the airport to Eco House.\n\nThe situation of Bangkok was cozy\
  \ and no crowds at night. The bus was so clean and not full. We paid using cash.\
  \ It took fast until we got lost. Fortunately, he, my travel mate was a good map\
  \ reader. The driver bus and the assistant were so friendly, they guided us to stop\
  \ the alternative road to get closer of Eco house, they only used gestures to explain.\
  \ \n\nWe walked along the road which closed shops and food street seller surrounded.\
  \ Fruits, sausages, warm Thai food were available and seductive. But we kept walking\
  \ to the Eco house way, we passed an empty path, houses, residences, railway station\
  \ and finally we got it. A pale green gate with traditional house which gardens\
  \ inside and consist of fourth floors, each balcony had garden and dining out door,\
  \ so cozy and homie. Cats and dogs were welcoming, mewing, barking and approaching\
  \ with the fragrance colorful flowers refreshing our minds. We went to the second\
  \ floor and open the door, surprised our room was small but really clean, double\
  \ bed, shower, toilet, tables, bathroom equipments, hairdryer, water and coffee\
  \ sachets were provided.\nWe were calmly sleeping then.\n\nWe woke up early morning,\
  \ we exchanged gift from our own country, I gave him Indonesia gift and he gave\
  \ me France gift. We were extremely happy and closer and started travelling to Golden\
  \ Mount Temple or Wat Saket. We noticed lots of street food sellers, Tuk Tuk drivers,\
  \ Taxi drivers and minimarkets (7-Eleven). We got on Bangkok Canal boat, it was\
  \ available everyday, morning to evening, it brought us to seven destinations. It\u2019\
  s really cheap, always full of local tourists and foreigners, the boat took me fast\
  \ and we enjoyed side views left and right, boat could turn the upper/ceiling down\
  \ when it passed the bridges/bow. A driver and assistant had a good communication,\
  \ they concerned on passengers, they gave information for each stop/destination.\
  \ They also allowed us to sit in front of the boat (the edges). We were so happy,\
  \ taking pictures and recording video. Everybody smiling and laughing looking at\
  \ us. We couldn\u2019t control our happiness. Finally, we stopped and got our destination,\
  \ Golden Mount or Wat Saket.\n\nWe walked a bit the bridges. We found Wat Saket,\
  \ we changed our costumes to respect before entering temple. It\u2019s such a big\
  \ hill, we hiked, it contained of caffe, praying room, big bells, craft shops, and\
  \ golden mount on top, it was really big and the stupa was made from Golden. Lots\
  \ of prayers visited. We could buy flowers and hearts paper to write our names and\
  \ hang it to the branches for goodness and fates. We were excited and extremely\
  \ tired hiking up, taking pictures of each statues, sleeping Buddha statues, garden,\
  \ fountain, city view. After that, we had brunch at food stall near Wat Saket. We\
  \ ate sunny side up, Thai cuisine and snacks. The weather was so hot and crowded.\
  \ It\u2019s time for lunch for all people both tourists and workers. My travel mate\
  \ was just looking at me and smiled, it was tiring but happy, we got closer, talked,\
  \ discussing more and more till we found our same preferences. Bangkok was so cool.\
  \ It\u2019s the best choice for traveling even honeymoon. Lots of parks which concerned\
  \ on education, healthcare, so greeny provided trees, library, rubbish bin, notice\
  \ and caution for smokers, toilet, playground and gyms. Local people had high motivation\
  \ to keep clean and responsive to their country. They had awareness. Bangkok was\
  \ one of the most popular shopaholic in South East Asia. Asian and foreigners always\
  \ welcomed. I was not regret to spend my holiday in here. I got my travelmate. We\
  \ got closer. Our love was starting from Bangkok. To travel one country was never\
  \ enough so travel more."
