Text: "The jeep jerked to a sudden stop at a dead end in the misty Khasi hills. Mighty\
  \ unimpressed with the mud wall before me, I looked with question marks at my travel\
  \ companions. \u201CWe're in the right place,\u201D they replied to my unspoken\
  \ question. \u201CWe have to be.\u201D \n\nI was traveling across North East India\
  \ with a bunch of six boys I\u2019d only met two days before. My travel companions\
  \ had quickly caught on to my tendency to plunge into the deep end of unknown. At\
  \ this point, none of us had phone service. We were to spend the night camping before\
  \ the clear waters of River Umgot, India\u2019s only transparent waterbody, in the\
  \ state of Meghalaya. A steep trek through the dense jungle 40 minutes later and\
  \ my feet touched cold, wet sand. The river gurgled before me, reflecting a sprinkle\
  \ of stars. It was 6:30 pm. A spot of light was floating mid-air, like straight\
  \ out of Harry Potter. \u201CKayak across the river, come to campsite!\u201D yelled\
  \ a voice that seemed to come from nowhere. The light belonged to a boatman who\
  \ was using a single oar to bring along another empty boat across the pitch black\
  \ waters. I had decided to be the lead oarswoman on one of the boats and ran towards\
  \ the light to claim my place. Once we packed ourselves and our luggage in the kayak,\
  \ we set off with a powerful push. It was mid-December and the temperature was 1\
  \ degree C. It didn't take long to reach the campsite. We were welcomed by the cosy\
  \ sight of four tents illuminated by a crackling bonfire. Dinner was ready, complete\
  \ with lalchai or red tea. An Assamese classic, this tea gives a deep reddish liquor\
  \ and is consumed without milk. My night finally ended several hours later, with\
  \ constellations imprinted in my eyes and the cold having taken up permanent residence\
  \ in my bones. \n\nFrom 4:00 a.m., the orange ball of the sun began its journey\
  \ across the sky. My warm up began as I scrambled over the massive boulders by throwing\
  \ myself over each rock and dragged my lower body up, with my upper body clinging\
  \ on to indents in the rock with dear life. This continued for two hours until I\
  \ paused to grab my breath and found myself halfway up a nearly vertical rock face\
  \ that felt impossible to ascend. This is when I gave up and turned around.\n\n\
  Iridescent blue-green waters winked from 60 feet below. Colourful little boats levitated\
  \ over transparent waters. On the other side, the Khasi hills curved and jagged\
  \ to form multifaceted cliffs before greeting the sky. Soon, I began to climb down\
  \ to the rock pools. The ochres and ambers and silvers that streaked the rocks perfectly\
  \ complemented the cool aquas, ceruleans and emeralds of the waters. Little rainbows\
  \ sparkled where the sun met the water. Sea slugs, snails and silvery-blue fishes\
  \ darted in and out between my toes. An hour later, the group gathered at the shores\
  \ of the cove to indulge in some adventure. We began by ziplining across the river,\
  \ only to jump off the cliffs from 20 feet above right into the blue. The transparent\
  \ waters morphed depth perception - it felt like I was jumping straight into the\
  \ rocks. My mind and body were in an adrenaline-infused high. After repeatedly throwing\
  \ myself into the cold waters to my heart\u2019s content, I rejected boat service\
  \ in favour of swimming across the river, armed with nothing but a life vest and\
  \ a whole lotta optimism. Alternating between swimming and floating, I could tune\
  \ out the rest of the world and relish the astral show that the clouds were putting\
  \ on. \n\nTo leave the crystal paradise that already felt like home, was painful.\
  \ Already attached to the people's kindness and the lush landscape, I made fervent\
  \ promises to return. I knew that a part of me would forever linger here; straddling\
  \ the insouciance of youth and the nuanced foresight of adulthood. If you haven\u2019\
  t been yet, seek out this hidden paradise cove nestled between the Khasi and Jaintia\
  \ hills, and ask for Jason's camp. Prepare to find yourself and lose yourself; magnificently\
  \ so."
