Text: "As the dust filled the air and I tried to muster all the power that I have\
  \ to take one more step forward, as my inner soul plead for my soles to take rest,\
  \ I heard my instructor before me saying, \u201Cjust a few more steps, we are almost\
  \ at the top\u201D. This and the urge to discover one of the most beautiful sites\
  \ in India with my friends gave me all the energy I needed to climb just a few more\
  \ steps. This is a story of the time when I went to trek up the third tallest mountain\
  \ in Karnataka, India.\n\n\nThe hot and humid air of India did not leave us with\
  \ mercy, but it gave us the opportunity to embrace the beauty in its harsh environments.\
  \ Persistence might just be a word everyone knows, but I fully understood it on\
  \ the peak of Tadiandamol, when my instructor told my friend to be still under the\
  \ scorching sunlight above us and with a bug crawling on his face. The dry land\
  \ and our empty bottles during the journey did not ease our pain, however, it made\
  \ the peak ten times more beautiful because we got to see our whole journey in just\
  \ one perfect picture. \n\nBut the beauty of this whole trip was not just the peak\
  \ of the mountain, it was the journey we took to get there, the nature that we got\
  \ to witness before the final picture, and the harsh environment that got to our\
  \ body but left our mind in awe of its power. I was perplexed under the star, with\
  \ its beauty before my eyes, the pitch black nature and the cool air getting on\
  \ my skin, which made me reflect about the things I learnt from being here. I learnt\
  \ about friendship, and how you get not only yourself to the peak of the mountain\
  \ but your friend and the whole group as well. When we were out there in the nature,\
  \ we weren\u2019t just friends who came here for the same purpose, but we became\
  \ herd that moved together, in sync with our breaths, in sync with the nature\u2019\
  s motion, we moved together then to see the final picture, the picture that gave\
  \ our journey the purpose it needs."
