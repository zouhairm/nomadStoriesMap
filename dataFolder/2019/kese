Text: "Mucking around on the ferry caught the eyes of three young kids sitting with\
  \ their Mum so I asked them where they were going; \u2018To Kese, Dad\u2019s home.\u2019\
  \ They told me to come too.\n\nNext day, I was negotiating with locals to see if\
  \ anyone could take me and managed to secure a place on one of the fishing boats.\
  \ Jumping on board with five local men I thought this would be an adventure of a\
  \ lifetime or I\u2019d be making headlines for all the wrong reasons: tourist thrown\
  \ overboard, off remote Fijian islands...\n\nNinety minutes later we arrived, the\
  \ fisherman told me to wait as they sought out the locals. They returned dumbfounded;\
  \ I was expected. \nAs we walked up, the kids came running, squealing \u2018You\
  \ came, you came!\u2019 Turns out these were the Chief\u2019s grandkids, their first\
  \ time on the island having grown up in Suva. Their parents greeted me warmly and\
  \ introduced me to the family. Next thing I knew I was being wrapped in a sarong\
  \ and invited to participate.\n\n\u2018Follow our lead\u2019,  the children\u2019\
  s grandmother encouraged me as we danced from the huts towards the fire, each of\
  \ us holding a corner of the woven mat specially made for the grannies\u2019 homecoming.\
  \ I hummed to the tunes the women were singing, harmonising as best I could.\n\n\
  Each of the grandchildren in turn, was brought forward to the Chief, their grandfather,\
  \ as he blessed them, accompanied by drums. This was witnessed by the whole village,\
  \ each family group seated along the circumference.\n\nThe rapturous hubbub of laughter\
  \ and greetings was palpable.  I soon learnt it was National Fiji Day and many had\
  \ travelled home for their annual pilgrimage.\n\nLong into the night the celebrations\
  \ continued, everyone heartedly singing, deeply enthralled, catching up on what\
  \ had happened since their last visit. As I anticipated, regular offerings of Kava\
  \ ensued, though presented so differently to the precocious feel of conducted Kava\
  \ ceremonies I\u2019d experienced in the tourist traps.  \n\nSumptuous local feasts\
  \ were served in sittings: breakfasts of fresh seafood, marinated in coconut juice,\
  \ with breadfruit to mop up the savory sweet juices, topped off with cassava cake.\n\
  \nBack home a few weeks later I\u2019m sharing my photos from Kese with my Fijian\
  \ friend, he\u2019s incredulous. Unbeknownst to me I\u2019m sitting with dignitaries,\
  \ Federal Ministers and suchlike. He asks me about the band, I share how easy going\
  \ they were and how much I enjoyed their music. He tells me they are the Fijian\
  \ equivalent of the Beatles or One Direction at their height of their fame. \n\n\
  However it\u2019s the generosity of the Chief\u2019s family, the older women in\
  \ particular which stays with me the most. Invited into the heart of their community,\
  \ I\u2019m invited to participate alongside them in every way: sharing in tales\
  \ of family, love, the challenges and isolation of island life with the draw of\
  \ the city for young ones. With the heightened threat of climate change already\
  \ reaching their shores, they fear for their island\u2019s lives longevity. \n\n\
  A few days later as I\u2019m getting ready to depart, I\u2019m so conscious of my\
  \ privilege; I hug and thank everyone profusely sharing my contact details, reciprocating\
  \ as best I can with cash, clothing and novels a number had admired. I encourage\
  \ the family and the villagers to stay in touch and repeat my longstanding invitation\
  \ for them to also come and visit me in Sydney. \n\nAt the shore, as I hug the the\
  \ children\u2019s grandmother, the matriarch of the island goodbye, she shares again\
  \ her incredulity with my ease with island life, how I never once complained. \n\
  \nI thank her for her exceptional generosity. \n\nShe howls with laughter, she still\
  \ can\u2019t get over, how, I, a westerner, slept on the floor, so she could sleep\
  \ in her bed."
