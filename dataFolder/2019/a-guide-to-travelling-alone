Text: "A few years ago I was faced with the prospect of spending Thanksgiving alone.\
  \  So I went went to Kayak and put in a a max price point and trusted an internet\
  \ search to find my dream vacation.  Ho Chi Minh City (Siagon) came back at the\
  \ top of the list.  So I bought my ticket, went to amazon and bought a travel guide\
  \ and began planning for a 10 day adventure on the other side of the world.  \n\n\
  I read my travel guide faithfully as I planned for my trip,  I researched history,\
  \ found images of natural wonders and saught out ANYONE that had traveled to Vietnam\
  \ in the last decade.  As an analytical person, I figured a plan would maximize\
  \ an experience where I was only accountable to myself.  Exactly one week before\
  \ Thanksgiving I took my passport, carry on and and ample reading material to Newark\
  \ to prepare for the longest flight I'd ever taken in my life.  I should have known\
  \ the trip would be an adventure when during my layover in Japan I saw Taylor Swift\
  \ in the airport.  \n\nUpon arrival I checked into my hotel and headed to the nearest\
  \ watering hole.  I needed to see people, breathe fresh air and stretch my legs.\
  \  On my way to the nearest bar, I made a conscious decision to spend this trip\
  \ engaging with more people, try new something new once a day and to try and avoid\
  \ eating every meal alone.  These rules proved the form the foundation of for the\
  \ BEST trip I ever took in my life.  \n\nSince I arrived on Saturday night, I was\
  \ able to tackle the engage with more people people assignment immediately.  I was\
  \ fortunate enough to me a few expats that had only recently arrived in Ho Chi Minh\
  \ City themselves.  That night I soaked up some local air, local beer and foreign\
  \ company.  The next day I had lunch with a recent arrival, and he took me around\
  \ the city as we talked about the country, the people and things to avoid more than\
  \ things to do.  I reviewed my itinerary my personal tour guide and the local bartender\
  \ more confident in my choices than ever.  \n\nTwo days later I flew to Hanoi to\
  \ embark on a trip to Halong Bay.  I must say I did not know what to make of Hanoi\
  \ upon my arrival, and figured I would experience some food that hit closer to home,\
  \ and found a local \"Tex-Mex\" restaurant near my hotel.  What I didn't get in\
  \ authentic food, I was more than compensated with an authentic Tex-Mex and Vietnamese\
  \ experience.  I have never felt so welcomed as a tourist in my life.  I embraced\
  \ the difference of the experience, and was able to enjoy the authenticity of the\
  \ people.  I highly recommend spending a few days in Halong Bay, by the by.\n\n\
  My final stop in Vietnam was Phu Quac Island.  I was looking forward to a few days\
  \ on the beach enjoying a good book, the warm sun, and swimming in the ocean.  Upon\
  \ checking into my hotel I was fortunate enough to meet another group of tourists\
  \ who were there for pretty much the same reason I was.  It allowed me to experience\
  \ the trip on a deeper level.  I was able to share stories of my adventure with\
  \ people who had taken a parallel, while allowing my experience to be individual\
  \ and personal. \n\nUltimately, I returned to the harsh days New York City Christmas\
  \ season.  But, what stayed with me for months was the magnitude of the lessons\
  \ I learned on that trip.  I may have traveled to Vietnam alone, but I didn't have\
  \ a solo vacation.  By opening myself up to the experience, I was able to open up\
  \ my reserved self, let go of some control I have in planning, and find a way to\
  \ be in the moment more."
