Text: "The lions guarding the entrance of the cemetery were fast asleep. The only\
  \ sound as we climbed the steps to the city of the dead was the murmur of the wind\
  \ in the trees. My grandmother\u2019s grip on my arm was so tight it almost hurt,\
  \ but I didn\u2019t dare speak. On a cold winter\u2019s day, we had driven to her\
  \ hometown to visit the resting place of Verona\u2019s unsung lovers - my great-grandparents.\
  \ \n\nFar from the tourist-flocked sites of Romeo and Juliet, on the other side\
  \ of the river, lay a legacy of which my grandmother was the last keeper. Her brother\
  \ and sister had both passed, the former only days before I was born, the latter\
  \ when I was too young to remember. And yet I knew everything about Nino\u2019s\
  \ dazzling smile, Bianca\u2019s famous tempers, and the all-defying love that had\
  \ brought them into the world. I never tired of listening to the story of how we\
  \ all had come to be, and as we made our way to a dimly-lit wing of the cemetery\
  \ I turned to my grandmother, eager to hear the tale once more. \n\nThat\u2019s\
  \ when I noticed tears glistening in her eyes. \n\n\u201CNonna\u201D, I asked, \u201C\
  What\u2019s wrong?\u201D She looked at me, her face torn with shameguiltangerpainyearn,\
  \ and whispered, \u201CI\u2019m lost\u201D. \n\nWas it an early sign of dementia,\
  \ the disease that would eventually rip her from me, erasing the outlines of my\
  \ very existence from her memory, or simply the result of a long absence? To this\
  \ day, I cannot pinpoint the exact moment she started to slip away; but as I watched\
  \ her desperately look for cues amidst a multitude of graves, faded pictures and\
  \ withered flowers, I felt a wave of protectiveness wash over me. With time, it\
  \ would become a tide, a sea, an ocean. There was nobody around - nobody that remembered\
  \ that my great-grandparents ever existed, that my grandmother was once a child,\
  \ that this charming city had been brutally bombed, that young men had left their\
  \ homes to fight a war, that they had names and families and dreams. \n\nThere was\
  \ nobody around, except us. \n\n\u201CNonna\u201D. I took her hand. \u201CTell me\
  \ the story of how great-grandmother renounced her inheritance to marry great-grandfather\u201D\
  . We exchanged a glance, and I saw resolution harden in her eyes. She started to\
  \ speak with that soft voice of hers, in the accent she\u2019d never lost, even\
  \ after marrying a Sicilian and raising a Ferrarese.\n\nGreat-grandmother Angela\
  \ had long black hair, always worn in a thick braid. She only undid it at night;\
  \ the rest of the day was spent cleaning and washing until her hands were rubbed\
  \ raw. She was born a Giordani, and had been raised by a guardian in a villa too\
  \ big for them alone. Perhaps because she\u2019d been an orphan her entire life,\
  \ she dreamed of starting a large family of her own, at whatever cost it came. \n\
  \nGreat-grandfather Valentino had the looks and charisma of an actor, and a heart\
  \ of gold. But that was all he had to offer as dowry, and great-grandmother was\
  \ banned from seeing him. \u201CYou\u2019re never going to marry a bricklayer\u201D\
  , said her guardian. \u201CHe\u2019s never going to make you happy\u201D.\n\nHe\
  \ was right. Great-grandfather didn\u2019t make her happy. He made her a free woman,\
  \ a tireless fighter, and a mother of four. He built her a house and a family all\
  \ the money in the world couldn\u2019t have bought. And they loved each other until\
  \ the end, through wars and rationing and the loss of their third-born child. They\
  \ planted a seed that grew in my grandmother, who married a younger man: my grandfather\
  \ Andrea, a gentleman like they don\u2019t make them anymore. \n\nA smile had returned\
  \ to my grandmother\u2019s face. I saw it in her eyes before she spoke: now she\
  \ remembered. And so we disappeared down yet another corridor, our arms still linked,\
  \ a white head and a black one. \n\n\u201CBelieve in a love that is being stored\
  \ up for you like an inheritance\u201D, Rainer Maria Rilke wrote in his Letters\
  \ to a Young Poet.\n\nI know mine is stored in a cemetery in Verona. I try to honour\
  \ it every day."
