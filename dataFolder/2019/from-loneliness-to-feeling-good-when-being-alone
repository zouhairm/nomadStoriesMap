Text: "Her face was sunburned, but her eyes were cheerful. There is something like\
  \ immediate connection and I knew that both of us were there with a purpose. Took\
  \ a cr\xE8me from my backpack and sat down. We spoke the only language that people\
  \ all around the world know \u2013 smile. I wanted an approval that I can be there\
  \ for her. She was standing so close to me, I saw it as a sign. In the middle of\
  \ the Himalayas, the world stopped for me. There was just a moment of pure joy of\
  \ helping one beautiful soul grow. \n\nSomething went to my throat, tears started\
  \ to flow. I kept walking and fighting with my thoughts. What was the reason of\
  \ my sadness, I wanted to know. Why I felt they\u2019re living a poor life, when\
  \ their eyes spoke with inner peace. It was a flood in me, that needed to go out\
  \ and clean my feelings. Needless to say, I already changed. Getting to know with\
  \ the aspect of my personality I couldn\u2019t see before. The world we see is the\
  \ mirror of who we are. \n\nGetting to know within is the most beautiful gift a\
  \ travel can give. But a month ago I was afraid. Finally, everything seemed to be\
  \ OK and my therapy came to an end. Being alone with myself for 20 days was a test\
  \ and a terror. Like walking in the dark, you never know what you can find deep\
  \ inside. Seemed like a horror that I decided to get through. \n\nThe only distraction\
  \ from outer world during trekking are the sounds of water, leaves and birds. Walking\
  \ and listening to the instincts is an everyday calling. Like a worm from the outside\
  \ that hides a butterfly, the good things take time. Ten days to meet and connect\
  \ with the soul while conquering the ABC peak. Travel is a spiritual journey, meeting\
  \ with forgotten parts, picking them up and taking to a regular life. \n\nFrom loneliness,\
  \ I got to feel good when being alone."
