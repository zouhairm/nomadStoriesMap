Text: "I stretched on the bed, my eyes flickered the room. Across is the closet left\
  \ ajar, I sighted my aso-oke of many colors, a traditional attire. On the table\
  \ is a bowl of oil palm fruits and a bottle of water with a handwritten label, \u201C\
  Owu Waterfalls, Kwara State, Nigeria\u201D.\n\nThe train left by 1.00pm. I, with\
  \ eleven friends, eight ladies, three guys went on a tour. It was my first train\
  \ experience in Nigeria. \nThe engine bellowed. On board, we partied, played games\
  \ and other passengers joined. The ride took a while. Out of the train into the\
  \ early morning, the town seemed hazy and peaceful, a cool breeze brushed past my\
  \ face, there I figured the adventures had begun.\n\nA journey to the unknown.\n\
  \nLocated in Owa-Kajola village, Isin local government area, Kwara state. Owu waterfalls\
  \ is one of the tallest waterfalls in Nigeria, 120m above sea level, gushing 330\
  \ ft down an escarpment with rocky outcrops at the base as a natural swimming pool.\
  \ According to oral history, Owu was discovered some centuries ago by a local hunter,\
  \ Jimoh Aremu, who went in search of animals but found the waterfall. Myth claimed\
  \ there was a rainbow and a mysterious anaconda at the fall, also the louder you\
  \ screamed, the more the intensity of the fall. \n\nWith high expectations, accompanied\
  \ by a local guide, we meandered through the rugged terrain with tropical rainforest\
  \ vegetation, dense, lush and evergreen into the unknown. Petrichor! the earth breathed,\
  \ it rained the night before. Down the hill, we discovered a tree had fallen on\
  \ the road, the driver made a diversion but unfortunately got stuck in a ditch.\
  \ Oh, no!.\n\nPush Until Something Happens!\n\t\nI pushed along with my friends\
  \ while the driver accelerated. The tires were buried deep into the earth, I pulled\
  \ out my phone but phones were out of network. It dawned we only had ourselves in\
  \ the middle of nowhere. \n\nThe tree was an oil palm tree, Elaeis guineensis, with\
  \ reddish palm fruits. It fell as a result of the rain. The palm fruits, highly\
  \ nutritious, serve various purposes. The palm oil, red in color, derived from the\
  \ fruits, is used in cooking meals. The fruit also has an inner kernel where the\
  \ palm kernel oil, colorless, is extracted from. Zero cholesterol and rich in antioxidants,\
  \ kernel oil improves hair growth and nourishes the skin radiantly with anti-aging\
  \ benefits. The fruits can be used for making soaps and as feed for animals. Hmm,\
  \ this fruit is packed with all shade of awesomeness. The Banga soup as well, mentioned\
  \ Edem. Banga soup is a tasty delicacy indigenous to the southern region of Nigeria.\n\
  \nThe sun was scorching, tensions were high. It\u2019s over an hour and still no\
  \ headway. Are we ever going to find a way out?. \nTwo Fulani nomads moved with\
  \ their cattle. Help us! we pleaded. With their machete, the tree was chiseled and\
  \ pushed out of the way. Some stones and sticks to aid as balance while the driver\
  \ started the ignition and accelerated, we pushed harder.\n\nZoom! Alas! the bus\
  \ was out. Thank Goodness! We screamed for joy...\n\nFinally, to a stop. Our guide\
  \ led us through an unguided path. Twist and turn. Watch your steps!, I beckoned\
  \ to my friends. Tshiiii\u2026, the continuous rustling sound of the fall welcomed\
  \ us to her abode from afar. Lo and behold, I lifted my gaze at this magnificent\
  \ African beauty, oozing with pride and cascading fresh water from a source on top\
  \ of the hill forming a natural swimming pool by the base. Wow! Owu, you are indeed\
  \ a beauty!...\n\nThe lush green vegetation and its cool breeze calmed my nerves.\
  \ All I needed was a shower. Yes!, we screamed loudly and Owu poured out her contents\
  \ vigorously on us. The showers were indeed refreshing and rewarding. I didn\u2019\
  t get to see the giant snake, the story continued that it became a terror and the\
  \ villagers appeased the gods, it vanished...\nI found an empty bottle by the sitting\
  \ arena. \n\nSunset, It\u2019s high time we headed to the hotel. \nWith a full water\
  \ bottle and palm fruits in my backpack, I got the best souvenir ever."
