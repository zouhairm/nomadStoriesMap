Text: "Almost ten years ago I traveled to Lisbon for a short vacation while I was\
  \ studying my master in Spain. The city has its charm. There is the old part of\
  \ the center, where all the streets involve walking slopes, the ground is irregular,\
  \ and well, I recommend you walking with comfortable shoes and if possible stop\
  \ every so often to rest because your feet will end up turned into a crash.\n\n\
  We walked so much and saw so many different places in such a short time. In Lisbon\
  \ the streets are narrow; the sidewalks are narrower. So much so that if a person\
  \ came in the opposite direction you had to stop, wait for the cars to pass to continue\
  \ walking. We knew when we were in the right place, by the number of tourists around,\
  \ and we knew when we probably took the wrong address if we met a funeral in the\
  \ middle of the afternoon.\n\nChurches and castles were our most significant attractions.\
  \ The castle of S. Jorge seemed more as a fortress surrounded by nature and restaurants.\
  \ But with a beautiful viewpoint.\n\nSurely we had a short time visiting, but in\
  \ a next trip, I would like to sit in the park and talk with the old lady who has\
  \ a lot to say about the place that she has always lived. Or listen more from the\
  \ taxi driver about that part of the city in Porto where only has twenty years of\
  \ creation. And talking about Porto, the wine village and the port are just as unique\
  \ as the virgin in Fatima. But, you have to be careful with some pickpocket, especially\
  \ on the bus. \n\nEither way, it is never the same when you are a traveler as when\
  \ you are a tourist. Last time I was a tourist, now I would be a traveler, making\
  \ pauses, watching the rooftop of red brick, feeling the streets more than is my\
  \ foot and having a better connection than in 2012. Also, trying again a Francesinha\
  \ could be great."
