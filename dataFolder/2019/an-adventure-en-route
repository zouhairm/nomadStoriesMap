Text: "Gazing across the moon-like desert down into the valley of the ancient city\
  \ of Petra, the gloriously musty smell of the horse I was riding played in the air.\
  \ In that moment, I felt simultaneously so far from real life and yet more present\
  \ than I ever had. But this place was a long way away from where I had been just\
  \ the day before. \nAt twenty years old, this was my first major trip and I\u2019\
  d been traveling for over a month. I decided give myself a break and booked an organised\
  \ trip to Petra. It\u2019s association with Indiana Jones is an appropriate one,\
  \ there is something of a call to adventure about the whole place. From the majesty\
  \ of the infamous Treasury right down to the magical marbling of the rock itself.\
  \ \nOn my first day exploring I ran into Feras, a Petra local. Despite his main\
  \ residence being a cave, he added me on Facebook (we are still friends!) and recommended\
  \ I hike up to the monastery. A glance at the guidebook told me the monastery was\
  \ about a two-hour hike from where I was and I was already fried and dehydrated\
  \ from a long day in the beating sun. I starting making my way back towards the\
  \ entrance, resolved to get up early the next day and make it to the monastery before\
  \ the midday sun.\nAt the ticket office, however, my brilliant plan seemed foiled.\
  \ As my ticket had come as part of the trip price, I hadn\u2019t realised how expensive\
  \ a one-day pass was! My shoestring budget groaned as I stood paralyzed wondering\
  \ what to do for the best. Perhaps bemused by this dithering tourist, the proprietor\
  \ of the \u201CIndiana Jones Gifts Shop\u201D struck up a conversation with me.\
  \ I explained my predicament and he asked me how good I was at horse-riding. Failing\
  \ to see the connection, I said I was rusty but had a decent amount of experience.\
  \ He presented a cunning plan: as a Jordanian, he could get tickets for next to\
  \ nothing and he also owned a stables. If I paid him a small fee he would buy me\
  \ a ticket and let me go on the early morning warm-up ride his horses had to do\
  \ anyway. This would also get me fairly close to the monastery. \nThe next morning\
  \ and the half-light of 5am cast a glow over the horses as they kicked up dust.\
  \ Perhaps it was Petra\u2019s call to adventure which had challenged me to accept\
  \ the offer. Now here I was, readying two horses with a friendly stable master as\
  \ we prepared to ride out. Much of my riding experience comes from sweet but fairly\
  \ heavy set ponies. By comparison, this sleek Arab horse was the Ferrari to my Renault\
  \ Clio. Even in the twilight I couldn\u2019t help but admire her bright, chestnut\
  \ coat. Her saddle and bridle were complete with little tassels that made me feel\
  \ as if I were about join a Bedouin tribe. The smell of musty hay and leather shook\
  \ loose as I lifted myself onto her back and I knew I was about to have the experience\
  \ of a lifetime. \nAs we set off, I realised we would be riding parallel to the\
  \ valley of Petra yet high above it. Sure enough, we were soon peering down at glimpses\
  \ of yesterday\u2019s caves and monuments. The silence was deafening and beautiful.\
  \ Just the odd whistle of breeze and the dusty clopping of the horse\u2019s hoofs.\
  \ At the highest point we came to a long stretch of flat ground. The stable master\
  \ asked if I wanted to gallop and I needed no encouragement. All at once the wind\
  \ roared in my ears and I saw nothing but bouncing desert and azure sky. \nI think\
  \ about that gallop often. In that moment something about my new-found adventurousness\
  \ crystallised. Previously, I would have never seized chances or been present enough\
  \ to truly enjoy precious moments. I could have turned down the offer or made the\
  \ whole ride about getting to the monastery \u2013 but for whatever reason, I didn\u2019\
  t. That ride gave me the confidence to have adventures but remains my greatest adventures\
  \ of all."
