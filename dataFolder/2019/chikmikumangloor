Text: I can hold the moment in my arms as i own it,yes i own it .I am lying on the
  grass of this million year old mountain from which i can see layers of different
  feelings.These layers started from the base ground layer bangalore which is approx
  270 kms from chikamglur from where i started my journey .I just knew the the place
  chikmanglur which was a gift for a daughter from his father as a dowry .This was
  a heavenly gift for an angel who can just sit with peace of mind sipping coffee
  plucked freshly from her plantations on the mountains.These sneekiy peeky,lively
  and peaceful road makes an imaginary home in my mind.Journey started from eating
  idli and masala dosa as breakfast after travelling for like 70 kms we reached to
  bahubali temple which is so unpredictable for the views and for the steps that u
  cant even remember.The big bahubali standing as steady and shiny black as the volacano
  holding lots of  strong lava of so  many saints.the route is just like a river which
  flows and dance together.coconut trees on the edges will be your companions all
  the way to chikmanglur.You can hold the sun in your hand on the long highways giving
  you wallpapers for your devices holding you in the crowd and giving genuine presence
  through it.You just have to look at these wallpaper cum photos  cum memories which
  will tell their story of the whole journey without asking.Now we have reached to
  hassan city where shantaleshwar temple rules the city just by its presence.The carving
  and engraved gods will fascinate you and will make you think about the perfection
  attained through the intricay done on the walls, columns, floor and the ceiling
  of the temple.The garbhgriha is filled with the pleasant sound which silents your
  mind voices even if you are standing in the mid of the crowd. After acheiving half
  of the peace temptation started to crave more .I can now see huge mountains from
  80 kms itself.the tree canopy covering roads is welcoming me .I can hear the eco
  near the gorur dam of different worldy species .My focus is now on the mountains
  and  you know what  I didnt  even realised that i have entered the city . I am not
  tired mentally ,its just my body which cant absorb this purity.It will take a bit
  of time .let it be lying like a sponge.After taking a night break under the blanket
  of beautiful oddly stars my day started with blissful foggy morning and sun rubbing
  his eyes in between.I can hear the birds chirping near the manmade lake hirekolale.
  The lake is a mirror which reflects a positive image of yours as if it is a mirror.You
  dont need water to wash away your sleep reflected sunrays will work for you .Driving
  on the edges to see the buttermilk waterfalls scared me but gave me the eternal
  sunshine for creating a spotless mind for me.You will get natural massage and happiness
  therapy on the humpy and bumpy road while reaching up there . the height of the
  waterfall will remind you of your dreams as pure as the water and will cold feet
  you to stay longer and flush away all your pains through the flow of water.It will
  cry for you and for your pains to heal you.Till then the tan on the face started
  to show the struggle to attain the heights of chikmanglur. Temple in the mountains
  tells a story of bababudangiri who still live there  as blessing for the travelers
  welcoming through the relieved breathes. The train in the mg park leads you nowhere
  but will surely makes u laugh and giggle with the children ringing the bell hanged
  on the edge of the train door.the long walks on the streets can never make you feel
  lonely.I miss how people melt on your smile just After helping you. I thank king
  rukmanagada for giving this peaceful place to his daughter,I am happy and I think
  you are just like my father .
