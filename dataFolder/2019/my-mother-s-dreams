Text: "Bolivia is the guardian of my mother\u2019s dreams. At sixteen, she arrived\
  \ alone at the train station in Potos\xED, thousands of miles from her home in the\
  \ United States. At twenty, I stepped off a bus on the opposite side of the city.\
  \ I had missed her arrival by forty years, but she reminisced that nothing had changed\
  \ when I sent her photos of the dusty, winding streets outside the station. \n\t\
  We will see Potos\xED, she told me when I was growing up. But when her doctors told\
  \ her that her cancer made it so that she was too sick to travel, we stopped planning.\
  \ Potos\xED became a dusty relic of horn pipes, pottery jars, and silver jewelry\
  \ high up on the living room shelves. I always imagined my mother as a woman of\
  \ two worlds: in one, she was my mother. In the other, she was a \u2018shadow woman\u2019\
  , haunted by feelings of a life not quite finished and dreams of a country she would\
  \ never see again. \n\tWhen I turned twenty, I decided that I had to see it for\
  \ her. After I received my Bolivian visa, I promised her that I would find her house\
  \ in Potos\xED. This became my burden. I carried it with me along with a packet\
  \ of old postcards, a few of my mother\u2019s letters, and a fading polaroid of\
  \ an old brown adobe house.\n\tArriving in Potos\xED, Bolivia, I realized that the\
  \ city is a world unto itself, far outside of the realm of google maps. To find\
  \ an address, you have to ask around and pray that someone understands your broken\
  \ Spanish well enough to point you in the right direction. As I walked through the\
  \ central plaza under the shadows of crumbling cathedrals and government buildings,\
  \ I obsessed over the cobblestones. Like the faded pastel walls and the faint glow\
  \ of mountain mines on the hills around Potos\xED, they had known my mother when\
  \ she walked these streets as a teenager. Forty years later, I was begging them\
  \ to reveal her secrets. \n\t I wandered through the bustling streets surrounding\
  \ the market, past stalls of shouting street vendors and children with sweet smelling\
  \ pastries. The cobblestones gave way to dust. Behind me, the city grew quiet and\
  \ the world retreated until I was alone, counting house numbers in late afternoon\
  \ sun. A woman in the market had pointed me down a road towards the city walls.\
  \ I asked her about the address of my mother\u2019s house and she had eyed me questioningly\
  \ from her stall before brushing her hands on her apron laughing.  \n\tI was looking\
  \ for house number forty-six near la plaza central . I wanted to ask my mother:\
  \ is that what home is? A two-digit number on a brown adobe house? The gritty taste\
  \ of dirt, your dirt, on your tongue?  I counted down in my head as I skimmed past\
  \ doorways.\n\tHome is a building, a memory, a person. Home is a place that guards\
  \ your ghosts. \n\tForty-six. I blinked and it was in front of me. \n\t\u201CHow\
  \ do you feel?,\u201D my traveling companion asked me repeatedly. I silently stood\
  \ in front of an old, brown adobe house. The world was held its breath. Taking an\
  \ old polaroid out of my pocket, I held it up in front of me and snapped a picture\
  \ on my phone. Hoping for service, I sent the photo to my mother. \n\tIn that moment,\
  \ my mother\u2019s ghosts became my ghosts, and my heart ached for everything that\
  \ her illness had taken away. The people walking by stopped to watch me, a gringa,\
  \ as I stood silently on the sidewalk, trying to remember every last piece of the\
  \ house in front of me. \n\tMy thoughts were interrupted by the buzz of my cellphone.\
  \ It was a message from my mother. \n\tThank you for letting me see it all one last\
  \ time, she wrote. \n\tFinally, after years of dreaming, crying, and aching for\
  \ all that we had lost, I was in the land of her dreams. There, in the summer glow\
  \ of the late-afternoon Andean summer, I began to weep."
