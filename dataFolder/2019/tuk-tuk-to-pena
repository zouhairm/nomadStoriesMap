Text: "It was nearing six thirty, the sunset was ready to lay behind the trees and\
  \ above me was the bumpy, tight roads leading to the peak of the Sao Pedro de Penaferrim\
  \ region in Sintra. The wind was still, and the sun\u2019s heat dried me tirelessly\
  \ throughout the day. I was trying to hitch a shuttle bus to Palacio Nacional da\
  \ Pena, which eventually turned into a race against time. The local busses were\
  \ filled with eager passengers ready to see the palace that looked over Sintra.\
  \ \n\nI desperately waved my arms at a nearby tuk-tuk driving towards me, hoping\
  \ he\u2019d make a sudden stop. The local tuk-tuk driver greeted himself as Antonio,\
  \ and kindly offered to take me up the Sintra Mountains above the Portuguese town.\
  \ I got in the tuk-tuk, and we began to ride up the hills of Sintra making our way\
  \ to the grounds of the Pena Palace.\n\nAntonio was a middle-aged Italian man, who\
  \ told me the tale of how he ended up in Sintra in the first place. He moved to\
  \ Lisbon and worked as a hawker for a decade or so before he decided to settle in\
  \ the mountains. Antonio explained that he bought a tuk-tuk and starting his own\
  \ one-man riding service, so he could ride up the mountains as fast as he could\
  \ and feel like the King of the Hill when his passengers reached their destination.\
  \ He got a kick from speeding up the Sintra Mountains.\n\nAntonio drove the tuk-tuk\
  \ as if it was an old-school, arcade bumper car. The tuk-tuk swerved through the\
  \ narrow roads, and every sharp turn felt\u2026 Sharp. Yet, at no given moment was\
  \ I scared despite how hectic his driving was. My adrenaline was running at an all\
  \ time high as we maneuvered our way along the neighborhood of luxurious villas.\
  \ I\u2019ve never felt so happy and willing to ride up the Portuguese foothills\
  \ with a stranger and his worn auto-rickshaw while traveling a foreign country.\
  \ In all the adrenaline that struck my body during the ride, there was an overwhelming\
  \ feeling of ease that would follow.\n\nAntonio insisted that we make a couple of\
  \ pit stops on our way up to Pena. The hills were comprised of pastel-colored villas,\
  \ palaces, castles, and mansions that all met as the centre piece in the vibrant\
  \ landscape of Sintra. The sunlight revived the surrounding plants and flowers,\
  \ making the entire town of Sintra that stood below me appear picturesque. As I\
  \ turned my head, I could see the vivid red tower of the Pena Palace peaking over\
  \ the tall trees; we were almost at our destination. Antonio took me up the last\
  \ stretch of our journey, minutes before the palace was scheduled to close. I quickly\
  \ hopped out of the tuk-tuk as he advised me of his return in an hour to take me\
  \ back into town. \n\nI arrived at the gates and at a first glance, Pena Palace\
  \ manifested the characteristics of a fairy-tale kingdom, sitting at the top of\
  \ the Sintra Mountains so harmoniously. The palace\u2019s exterior had bright, pastel-toned\
  \ shades of red, yellow, pink and blue walls, with mauve Portuguese tiles. The Neo-Gothic,\
  \ Neo-Islamic, Neo-Renaissance and Neo-Manueline fusion of architecture was impossible\
  \ to overlook, as it told their own story of the eclectic collection of styles that\
  \ culturally diversified with time.\n\nAs I made my way through the palace, I stumbled\
  \ upon the backside terrace with an open view of the landscape. Sitting at the top\
  \ of the Sintra Mountains, the Pena Palace graciously hovered over the miles and\
  \ miles of Portuguese land that surrounded it. I sat on the ledge of the palace\
  \ gazing the endless fields that lay before me. In that moment, time was still.\
  \ The birds danced in the winds and I couldn\u2019t help but look at the ocean-blue\
  \ sky with the sun\u2019s incandescent light piercing through the clouds. I didn\u2019\
  t expect to find so much comfort and calmness in such a foreign place, but there\
  \ was something so contagious about the blissful silence. The surrounding trees,\
  \ the infinite skies, and the heat of the sun that projected onto the palace successively\
  \ captivated the natural wealth of Sintra."
