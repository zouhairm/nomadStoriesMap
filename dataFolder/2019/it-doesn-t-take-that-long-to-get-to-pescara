Text: "\"What possessed you to travel to Italy and spend three months living in Pescara\
  \ with your four young children, all under the age of seven?\" I asked my father.\
  \ I was referring to three months in 1966. My father, a physician in a small, rural\
  \ town in Michigan, had met a surgeon from Italy. Dr. Catacazzino invited us to\
  \ live in his summer home, in Pescara, along the Adriatic. This much I knew.\n\n\
  \"Oh, your mother was bored\", he replied, smiling.\n\nThis much I remember.\n\n\
  As the TWA plane sat on the tarmac in Detroit, we were served tea a tray of fairy-sized\
  \ sandwiches and pretty, tiny cakes.\n\nAwakening in Rome, disoriented from what\
  \ I now know to be jet lag, it was late afternoon, frenzied traffic noise coming\
  \ through the hotel room's open window. My father took me to a caf\xE9, cappuccino\
  \ for him, a Coca-Cola for me, served in a tall, thin glass with ice and a sliver\
  \ of lemon. Terribly exotic, I thought, my legs happily dangling from my chair.\n\
  \nThe Pescara house was pleasant, large, airy rooms with tall ceilings, a kitchen\
  \ that opened to a stone courtyard. We were immediately across from the Adriatic,\
  \ and we went to the beach every morning. We played foosball and ate an ethereal\
  \ baked treat dusted with sugar and filled with thick cream. One outing, wading\
  \ in water, I felt a sharp pain in my right foot and began screaming. A man who\
  \ had been net-fishing near me rushed over. As he hoisted me out of the water, I\
  \ saw a crab clinging to my little toe.\n\nSome mornings my father would awaken\
  \ me early, and after a breakfast of bread sticks broken over a bowl of hot milk\
  \ for me, cappuccino for him, we would walk to the open market. I marveled at the\
  \ chaotic mounds of ripe fruit and vibrant vegetables, the fresh fish shining languidly\
  \ over crushed ice. In the warm evenings, our family would walk about town, stopping\
  \ to watch the Punch and Judy puppet shows and to eat cones of roasted peanuts wrapped\
  \ in bright red or green crepe paper. The Italian women would often greet us to\
  \ admire my youngest brother, Richard, speaking lovingly of his head of rich, dark\
  \ curls.\n\nMy mother encountered unexpected challenges to keeping four young children\
  \ clean during our stay. It was a house directive, apparently, that hot water for\
  \ bathing was only available for one hour each morning. We each developed impetigo\
  \ and, consequently, were were all briefly quarantined in Chicago during a stop\
  \ on our return flight from Italy to Detroit.\n\nI returned to Michigan at the end\
  \ of that summer, to the arrival of fall and new school shoes to begin second grade\
  \ at George Allen School. One day, as  I stood in line for hot lunch in the multi-purpose\
  \ room, I spied a globe on the counter amidst other school supplies. I gave it a\
  \ spin, and, after making it stop, turned it slowly until I could see the lengthy\
  \ boot of a place I now knew first-hand. Keeping my finger on the globe's Italy,\
  \ I turned to the boy behind me and told him, \"See this place? This is Italy. My\
  \ family went there this summer!\"\n\nThe boy's name was David Brewer. He had crewcut,\
  \ blonde hair. He looked at me as though I had claimed I had landed on the moon.\
  \ \"That is impossible\" he stated emphatically. \"It would take a million years\
  \ to get there!\"\n\nI was horrified at David Brewer's implication that I was a\
  \ liar. But then, I started to consider that perhaps there was some truth to his\
  \ accusation. Much of what I remembered about Italy seemed so far away and so dreamlike.\
  \ And I really did not have evidence that I had actually been to Italy. No souvenirs,\
  \ no bits of red or green crepe paper from the puppet show peanuts. No photographs,\
  \ other than our family passport photograph. \n\n\"Why don't we have any pictures\
  \ from that summer in Pescara?\" I recently asked my now almost eighty-six year-old\
  \ father?\" He paused, and smiled and replied, \"Your mother was busy.\""
