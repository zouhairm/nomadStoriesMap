Text: "I stood at the base of the mountain, staring up, in awe of this Volcano.\n\n\
  Guatemala has a dramatic landscape scattered with volcanic peaks & rapid rivers;\
  \ breeding life in the jungles growing from its ashen soil. It's a paradise of natural\
  \ wonders. But none are more breathtaking than its volcanos, which showcase Guatemala\u2019\
  s rich rainforests against an arid moonscape as molten rocks tumble down above you.\
  \ \n\nWhile climbing to the limits of an active volcano is a popular tourist adventure,\
  \ it is not for the faint of heart. Something I quickly discovered as we began our\
  \ calf-crunching ascent through humidity & mosquitos. As we climbed higher & were\
  \ rewarded with countryside views, I got to meet my fellow travellers. A Spaniard\
  \ hiking back to back volcanos; a New Zealander we adopted on our trip. And Paulo.\
  \ Paulo didn\u2019t fit the normal demographic of travellers visiting Volcan-de-Pacaya.\
  \ He looked more like a well-to-do local. As I narrowly avoid tree roots & low-hang\
  \ vines, his life began to unfurl. \n\nPaulo was from Nicaragua and at first glance\
  \ you'd think he on holidays. But despite his charming smile, his eye held uncertainty.\
  \ He was working remotely in Antigua, a postcard-perfect town outside Guatemala\u2019\
  s capital. As much as he was enjoying his weekend adventures to coffee plantation\
  \ & lake cruises, his voice still longed for home. He urged me to visit Nicaragua;\
  \ to explore it vibrant culture; to climb even more volcanos. He described a landscape\
  \ similar to Guatemala. So much so he almost felt as if he were home \u2026 almost.\
  \ \n\nWe emerged from the moss green canopy to a jarring new world. We stood amongst\
  \ the rubble of past explosions, a moonscape devoid of life. We were high above\
  \ the clouds now and the power this mountain had over life in Guatemala was palpable.\
  \ Unfazed by the potential violence this Volcano could unmask, Paulo continued on\
  \ climbing down into the volcanic plain. \n\nPaulo was no stranger to violence.\
  \ His stay in Antigua no holiday, but rather an exile. As the precarious sulphurous\
  \ rocks shifted under our feet, so to has the political climate of Nicaragua; of\
  \ many countries in Central America truth be told.  \n\nWhile Nicaragua had been\
  \ stable amongst the civil unrest plaguing Central America, this changed mid-2018.\
  \ Following the removal of financial aid from Venezuela, extensive cuts were made\
  \ to social welfare benefits by President Ortega triggering. Since then the political\
  \ climate has continued to erupt with peaceful riots ending in hundreds kill and\
  \ the UN condemning Ortega\u2019s administration for the jailing, torture and extrajudicial\
  \ killings of their opposition.  \n\nPaulo was one of their opposition.\n \nTogether\
  \ with his brother-in-law, Paulo had help organise protests and political speak-outs.\
  \ Despite his own financial security, he stood against an autocratic government\
  \ that was taking from the poor of an already impoverished country. A Latino Robin\
  \ Hood, if you will. That was, until his brother was arrested. \n\nHe watch his\
  \ family live in fear awaiting any news about their son, their husband, their father.\
  \ He spoke so calmly about the chilling uncertainty he woke with every morning.\
  \ 'Is he alive?'  He spoke as if this fear was an every day occurrence; like this\
  \ question was the same as \u2018what's for dinner?\u2019. Because for many, it\
  \ was. \n\nThree weeks later, Paulo\u2019s brother-in-law was returned home ...\
  \ alive. \n\nAfter experiencing this uncertainty nearly destroy his family, he knew\
  \ he couldn\u2019t stay. Paulo was one of the fortunate ones. He could leave.  As\
  \ we continued our travels, we met many not as fortunate. \n\nWe\u2019d reached\
  \ as high as we could go. The heat waves were visible off the rocks that surrounded\
  \ us. As I looked up towards the crater, not even a kilometre away, I could see\
  \ molten lava tumble down towards us. Just as heated as the politics in Central\
  \ America, this Volcano too has the might to disrupt the homes, the livelihoods,\
  \ the lives of those in Guatemala. And yet courageously they live on, never know\
  \ which one might erupt.\n\nBut to leave your home, your livelihood, your life behind\
  \ in search of a better one - one free from fear - that a different kind of courage.\
  \ \n\nI stood at the top of the mountain, staring up, in awe of this man."
