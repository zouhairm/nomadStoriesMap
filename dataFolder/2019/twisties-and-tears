Text: "It is midnight. I am standing alone in Kathmandu airport, watching the baggage\
  \ carousel loop round. My bag has not made an appearance. It has been fifty minutes.\
  \ How long should I wait before declaring it missing?\n\nI begin to contemplate\
  \ the past twenty-four hours of my life, during which I had officially become a\
  \ solo-traveller. A university-drop out taking a leap into the unknown world of\
  \ adventure and travel. Is this what it is supposed to be like? I feel exhausted,\
  \ slightly shaky and a little nauseous.\n\nI focus my eyes on the baggage carousel,\
  \ trying to rid the anxiety from my mind. My bag will appear. I will make it to\
  \ my accommodation. Everything will be fine. At the hour mark I start looking around\
  \ the airport hall, attempting figure out what to do next. Out of the corner of\
  \ my eye I see something familiar; my light-blue suitcase has finally arrived -\
  \ the last of the lot. Relief floods through me as I collect my bag and begin to\
  \ think through my mental checklist:\n1)\tSuccessfully enter the country on tourist\
  \ visa \u2013 check.\n2)\tCollect baggage \u2013 check.\n3)\tTurn on phone and text\
  \ your family to let them know you are safe \u2013 \nI pull my phone out of my bag\
  \ to quickly send the message. \u2018No service provider available,\u2019 my phone\
  \ blinks at me. I sigh and put it away, the message will have to wait until I have\
  \ a Wi-fi connection.  \n\nOn to the next step: \n4)\tLocate driver with your name\
  \ on a sign \u2013\nI make my way to the exit and glance around the taxi stop. There\
  \ are no people with signs. The hotel driver has not arrived. Cool. \n\n\u2018Would\
  \ you like to share a taxi?\u2019 another traveller asks me. The recommendation\
  \ to \u2018avoid catching taxi\u2019s alone\u2019 flits through my mind.\n\u2018\
  Sure,\u2019 I reply, introducing myself and giving the name of my hotel to the Nepali\
  \ man organising the cars. He recognises my hotel and tells me not to worry, the\
  \ driver will take me there shortly. \n\n I settle into my seat and begin to chat\
  \ with my fellow traveller. He is from Japan and he also has no clue what he is\
  \ doing here. I start to relax a little; I am almost at the hotel, almost to a bed\
  \ and almost to a Wi-Fi connection. Perhaps I can do this solo-travel thing.\n\n\
  The taxi stops at a small hostel where the Japanese man will stay. We bid farewell\
  \ and the taxi driver turns to me, asking questions of me in Nepali. I do not understand\
  \ what he is saying but I know that he has no clue where my hotel is; my anxiety\
  \ returns. The streets of Kathmandu are dark, dreary and deserted. As we weave through\
  \ unfamiliar streets I think about my situation: I am alone in a foreign country,\
  \ my phone is not working, I have no idea where I am, the driver does not know where\
  \ to take me, I speak no Nepali and he speaks no English.  My mother would not like\
  \ this. \n\nOne hours of street weaving later, I spot the sign for my hotel and\
  \ excitedly point it out to the driver. I check in, drag my suitcase up the tiny\
  \ stairs and collapse onto the floor of my room. There is a pile of dog poo next\
  \ to my face. \n\u2018Welcome to Nepal,\u2019 it says tauntingly\n\nAt least I can\
  \ now let my family know that I am safe. I pull out my to do this only to discover\
  \ that the Wi-Fi does not work. Classic. I spot half a packet of Twisties amongst\
  \ my things, comfort food is exactly what I need. I reach to grasp the packet of\
  \ cheesy, Australian snacks but I knock them to the floor. As the snacks crash to\
  \ the floor, my nerves crash too; I begin to cry. I am 19, I am alone in a foreign\
  \ country, I am alone and the only thing I want is my mother. Why did I come here?!\n\
  \n*Disclaimer: this was my first experience of solo travel. Trust me when I say\
  \ that it has gotten SO much better."
