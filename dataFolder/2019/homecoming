Text: '"The steps I take off of the Underground are the last that have me rooted in
  Toronto. Each step transports me closer to a home I am unaware of. My feet plant
  into the concrete of the last step and I am surrounded by something that I thought
  existed for me in Canada. Warmth, despite the rain that falls on my blushed cheeks,
  hugs me, my heart leaping completely into the distant cobblestone streets. What
  I see before me evokes a familiarity that I can only conceive as spiritual.

  I think of staying here and in my soul, I am whole. There are only a handful of
  steps between me and a cranberry red phone booth. My mind finds itself invested
  in a dream of when I can grasp that cool door handle and pull, with the absolute
  certainty that Heathrow will never again meet the soles of my black and white Chuck
  Taylor''s."


  This is a story I wrote just after I arrived in London, England for the first time
  in 2010. Immediately, I began to cry. I had never felt so at home than when I walked
  up the steps of the subway into Picadilly Circus. The amount of emotion I experienced
  when encountering this new place filled with new people and new experiences is more
  than anything I had ever felt in Toronto. My mother likes to say that I lived in
  London in a passed life. I just think I belong there; I think I found my new home.'
