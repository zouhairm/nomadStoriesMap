Text: "I surface with only a short swim to the beach after a most exciting drift dive\
  \ where white tip reefs sharks darted in and around our group of divers keeping\
  \ pace and drafting us like a a NASCAR driver preparing to slingshot to the finish\
  \ line. As I reached the shore I remember it being balmy tropical morning and I\
  \ disassembled my gear on the beach in Puerto Galara PI and awaited the arrival\
  \ of the multicolored seaplane to take us to our next dive site.  Its bright tropical\
  \ paint mirrored the colors of the reef fish that gathered underneath it to feed\
  \ on the leftover crumbs from the pilots breakfast.  This is exactly how I envision\
  \ the beginning of my best adventure would start.\n \nAs I climbed aboard and stowed\
  \ my gear my excitement grew as the pilot, an old salty dog of a man sporting wayfarer\
  \ sunglasses to cut the glare, explained how we would be flying with a ceiling of\
  \ 1,000 feet for safety but it would be a bit of a bumpy hide.  I listened to the\
  \ whir of the engine as the plane turned toward the horizon and began to skim across\
  \ the water like jesus lizard until we had lift off.  I looked out the window and\
  \ admired the beautiful beach all the while containing my excitement of diving the\
  \ old warships at Subic Bay.  My Grandfather was in the Seabees and had been stationed\
  \ in the Philippines.  He told me so many war stories of the large ships he had\
  \ witnessed destroyed in the bay. Now I would get to dive on those very same ships.\
  \  As it turned out he was ordered to abandon ship along with 300 other sailors\
  \ after a Japanese kamikaze pilot attacked their ship.  That night I travel by boat\
  \ just offshore to a small inlet where that same shit that my grandpa other had\
  \ abandoned was lying in 100 feet of murky water list thing ever so slightly to\
  \ it\u2019s Portside.  As I tumbled backwards from the boat and took my first breath\
  \ of air from my scuba tank my eyes straining to adjust to the darkness I saw the\
  \ ship.  It was frozen in time and I realized that I was swimming in my grandfathers\
  \ footsteps.  The massive ship was daunting and served as a sanctuary for a vast\
  \ array of marine life.  As I glided along the top deck I saw the hole left by the\
  \ Japanese aircraft and envisioned the terror my grandfather must have felt to see\
  \ a plane come crashing down into his ships top deck.  I realized I had been down\
  \ for just about 20 minutes and needed to make my way back to the surface.  In an\
  \ uneventful acent and of course my 3 minute safety stop my mind wandered to the\
  \ convesrsation I would be having with my grandfather.  Unfortunately I never got\
  \ the chance to tell him my story and show him the pictures as he passed while I\
  \ was away.  I take comfort that he is other his mates that didn\u2019t make it\
  \ out that fateful day.  And I pray that fair winds and following seas will be with\
  \ him always."
