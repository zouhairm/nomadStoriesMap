Text: I was in Puno and I decided to take a tourist bus back to Cusco. The bus was
  nice and I recommed it because it's stops along the way in beautiful places. In
  one of the stops a was able to feed a small cabra a baby one was so nice and exiting!!
  Then you can see and colonial church that survive an earthquake. Along the way you
  can also take great pictures of the mountains. In that way I meet a guide who now
  is may friend we have been friends for almost 15 years now. But that's just something
  that always happens when you travel along you meet new people something that I love.
  Well but the interesting thing was when I was wondering around in one of the stops
  near the mountains I found a group a children playing while they were moving a cabra
  they were five and some of them were sitting. I came near them. I say hi. That say
  hi that were ashame. But I did not want to bother then so I asked then if I can
  took a photo of them because they do not like to have they photo taken. They say
  yes. Some of them look at the camera, some just took care of the cabra but for me
  was the most beautiful photo that I have ever had taken.
