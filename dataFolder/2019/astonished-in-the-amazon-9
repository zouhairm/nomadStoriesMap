Text: "Dizzy, and colder than ever before, I was lying on the steep hard ice that\
  \ got me in this mess in the first place. Calmly waiting for the emergency team\
  \ to come get me, all could do is shiver and try to convince myself that the pain\
  \ was shock from the cold and nothing more. Boy was I wrong. \nIn February 2017,\
  \ my mother and my 19 year-old-self went skiing in Panorama, BC, to enjoy the week\
  \ I had off from university. 2 days before we would leave, the rainfall of the previous\
  \ night created ample patches of invisible ice. It\u2019s safe to say half the mountain\
  \ turned into a downhill skating rink\u2026which brings me to my injuries. \nAs\
  \ I normally do, I was darting down a steep run. Within milliseconds I realized\
  \ I needed to slow down as the packing snow below my skis transformed into thick\
  \ ice in the blink of an eye. Using all my force to stop myself-I was too late.\
  \ Head first, I tumbled down the mountain and felt the weight of my ski twist my\
  \ leg in a way it should never be twisted. I tore my ACL and meniscus, pinched my\
  \ sciatic nerve, and was slightly concussed. Tears finally wet my cheeks when the\
  \ doctor at the hospital said my plans to hike in Peru in May weren\u2019t realistic.\
  \ \n\u201CGood physio,\u201D I told myself about the pain as I sat on the plane\
  \ to Lima. 3 doctors said I couldn\u2019t do it, but the best ACL surgeon in North\
  \ America said I could (thank you Canada for free healthcare.) \nNot knowing that\
  \ my meniscus was damaged, I set out on my \u201CAmazon Adventure\u201D with Operation\
  \ Groundswell, a \u201Cbacpacktivism\u201D company. The large attention-drawing\
  \ knee brace that joined me just happened to be a great conversation starter. Knowing\
  \ that my brace was strong and my ACL could not be torn more than it already was,\
  \ I had nothing to worry about. \nAlthough traveling to exotic locations was nothing\
  \ new to me, no trip has changed my life as much as this one-particularly the 4\
  \ day hike in the Peruvian Amazon. \nSee, before this trip, I spent too much time\
  \ surrounded by the wrong people. As much as I hate to admit it, for a few months,\
  \ I became extremely obsessed with how I looked. I thought fake meant pretty. I\
  \ couldn\u2019t leave the house without fake eyelashes or fake tan because I truly\
  \ felt my worth came from my appearance. \nEvery day became an agglomeration of\
  \ stress, anxiety and perfectionism-because I couldn\u2019t stand not looking perfect.\
  \ \nFast forward to my Amazon hike. \n\u201CIs it metal?\u201D he said in Spanish.\
  \ The most gorgeous man I\u2019d ever seen tapped my brace. Struck by cupid, I blurted\
  \ out \u201CNo, it\u2019s plastic,\u201D although it is very clearly metal. (Picture\
  \ me slapping my forehead.) \nFully enjoying the challenge of rain, mud, mosquitoes\
  \ and steep terrain, I was surprised to find that the hike included a quick stop\
  \ on a coffee farm, where I met-let\u2019s call him, Alejandro. \nEye contact with\
  \ him spoke to my soul. Looking into his piercing blue eyes made time stop. I always\
  \ thought the descriptions in romance novels were so strange and exaggerated until\
  \ I felt it myself; call it love at first sight if you wish. \nAfter leaving the\
  \ farm, my guides told me Alejandro said I was \u201Csuper bonita,\u201D meaning\
  \ super pretty. \u201CMe!?\u201D I exclaimed, \u201Cwith no makeup, covered in sweat\
  \ and dirt!?\u201D I couldn\u2019t believe it. \nThis is the moment my life changed.\
  \ I realized that no matter what you do, someone will think you\u2019re beautiful\
  \ and someone will think you\u2019re not. More importantly, you will always be beautiful\
  \ to the people that matter most. \nThis allowed me to release my constant stress,\
  \ start focusing on more important things than beauty, and start living life to\
  \ the fullest. Who knew that all it would take to relax was a severe injury and\
  \ hiking in the Amazon?"
