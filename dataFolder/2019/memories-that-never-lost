Text: "Every fairy-tale story contains a hero, heroine, villain and some captivated\
  \ situations. My story is a fairy tale for me but contains one ticket of Udaipur,\
  \ two girlfriends, and one thought to be self-sufficient. A year ago, we decided\
  \ to go on a blind visit of Rajasthan to search some peace on our hustle life. We\
  \ booked a train ticket of Udaipur, one hotel on Udaipur and started with great\
  \ zeal in our hearts. City of lakes Udaipur never let down to impress anyone with\
  \ its beautiful palaces and peaceful lakes as heard from many people and now it\u2019\
  s our time to discover that beauty and peace. When we arrived at the hotel they\
  \ informed us it took around 4 -5 hours for a room to get allocated. It was frustrating.\
  \ We dropped our bag on reception and started walking to explore exotic palaces\
  \ and lakes of Udaipur. We started with Gulab Bhag and exhibition of Vintage Car\u2019\
  s Collection. It was mesmerizing one side of the road the dense canopy and on other\
  \ side vintage collection of cars which we always see in old movies. Although we\
  \ started with a bad note regarding hotels but our day was going on Hakuna Matata\
  \ note. We hired one local vehicle as per locals it was best to wander around. After\
  \ coming back from the exhibition we got dressed traditionally because in Rajasthan\
  \ it\u2019s all about traditional dress and food. We first stopped on the royal\
  \ City Palace, it was too long and alluring that it took 3 -4 hours to saw each\
  \ and every painting, inventions and architecture of that Palace.  We visited each\
  \ and every location of Udaipur but still, there was no sign of stopping our mental\
  \ fuss. I was desperately searching that place where words become less than to explain,\
  \ moment got rapport to feelings, from where I don\u2019t want to move further and\
  \ there my fairy tales end. Exactly the same moment encountered me where we were\
  \ visiting one of the oldest and scariest temples near Fateh Sagar Lake. It was\
  \ neither looking good nor giving us the feeling of wow. We were wrapping up fast\
  \ because the next location was exciting and much more creative than this old place.\
  \ But who knows this was the moment we were looking for our whole journey. The Sunset\
  \ was about to get the start and rays were getting low of every second of time.\
  \ The lake was shining like a bar of gold and sun was looking like a color changing\
  \ pearl on the golden shimmering plate. The whole Udaipur had swollen those raise\
  \ and with a flick, it got to light up with thousands of lighted shimmer. The beauty\
  \ of Udaipur got enhanced by this moment. All my pain got vanished watching those\
  \ magnificent Mo but this was not the end as Mr. Shahrukhkhan famous dialogue \u201C\
  Movie is still not over my friend\u201D. Next day we encountered the art gallery\
  \ \u201CLok Kala Mandal\u201D. The gallery contains all the type puppets which were\
  \ showing the tradition of India, different postures of handmade painting. I never\
  \ aspect that the building who was rusty and smashed form outside contain the whole\
  \ history in it. There was a puppet show after beheld every mannequin and painting.\
  \ We thought it was just a normal puppet show but how can I forget never judge a\
  \ show from its arena. We were sitting on a plastic chair and watching the black\
  \ stages where two puppets were sitting. As soon as lights all gone and the show\
  \ got start those puppets got a life like us. One of the girl puppets came through\
  \ the ceiling of the stage and dancing like anything my hands were forcing me to\
  \ take out my camera and filmed it. Her belly was shaking like Shakira her moves\
  \ were making everyone jealous. How did these guys do? How they create a non-living\
  \ puppet into a living being? I think we were here to learn a lot and taking back\
  \ a lot from those who are working day and night preserving our tradition and heritage\
  \ for future generation. This is not the end of my fairy tale just beginning."
