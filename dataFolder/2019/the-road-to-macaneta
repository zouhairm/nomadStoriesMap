Text: "We joined the back of a queue of 4x4s waiting to be ferried across the Incomati\
  \ river to reach Macaneta beach.  \n\nMacaneta is a gorgeous stretch of beach only\
  \ 30km outside Mozambique's capital city, Maputo, which makes it a popular destination\
  \ for locals and tourists.\n\nThe only way to reach the beach was to take the pontoon\
  \ ferry from Marracuene.  The ferry was old and overworked with a temperamental\
  \ engine that fought a daily battle with a fast-flowing river hell-bent on carrying\
  \ it away.\n\nThe ferry carried six 4x4s at a time and took an hour to do a round\
  \ trip.  Six cars every hour meant the queue grew long, quickly.  Marracuene locals\
  \ made the most of the wait time by opening small bars with esplanadas right next\
  \ to the queue where you could get out of your car and enjoy a beer or two in the\
  \ sun.  Vendors set up alongside the dirt road selling cool drinks, fresh vegetables,\
  \ matches, cooking oil, and brightly coloured sarongs with a map of Mozambique and\
  \ umbrella marked beaches printed on them.\n\nYou could sit in your car, windows\
  \ closed and AC on, and watch the line inch closer to the ferry; or, you could get\
  \ out and sit on one of the esplanadas, enjoy a national 2M beer, and maybe get\
  \ chatting to a fellow traveller or local.  The choice is yours.  But, only one\
  \ of those choices gives you the opportunity to interact with local people, support\
  \ their businesses, and connect.\n\nThe experience is what you make of it.\n\nAs\
  \ we approached the front of the queue, I watched as the ferry operators guided\
  \ drivers onto the deck and into their spots.  As the weight shifted, so the ramp\
  \ raised up and down.  When we drove onto the ramp, with every full wheel rotation,\
  \ the ferry bobbed and groaned under our weight.  I was quietly terrified.  Once\
  \ all the cars were in place, the pedestrians came aboard and filled the spaces\
  \ between the cars.\n\nThe crossing was smooth, and the views of the river were\
  \ beautiful.  We stood amongst the community: mostly women, carrying gas bottles,\
  \ large bags of vegetables and charcoal, and children on their backs; some men in\
  \ sun-bleached clothes, carrying tools, bags, and bicycles; a few children with\
  \ small bags of peanuts to sell.\n\nWhen the ramp went down on the other side of\
  \ the river, the cars and people streamed off and headed down a potholed dirt road.\n\
  \nThere were no signs; you follow the electricity poles or other cars.  The road\
  \ was flanked by sugar cane and open marshland.  There were children minding cattle\
  \ and playing games in the tall reeds.  They shouted, 'sweeties', with cupped hands\
  \ as cars drove past.  The cattle criss-crossed the road, blocking the way, and\
  \ paying no attention to the vehicles.\n\nAfter just enough time had passed to start\
  \ worrying about being lost, we saw a sign for the beach lodge we were heading to\
  \ for the day.  It marked the end of the impacted dirt road and the start of a sand\
  \ track.    \n\nWith tyres deflated and 4x4 engaged, we accelerated our Pajero Junior\
  \ onto the sand track and sped on a repeating S-shaped route hoping not to get stuck\
  \ in the sand or crash into the mangroves.  It's heart-in-mouth stuff.  But once\
  \ the track opened up into a parking lot, relief and excitement replaced the anxiety.\n\
  \nWe had arrived at Macaneta, a wild and scarcely populated beach you can walk for\
  \ miles without seeing anyone except a local dog who might accompany you part of\
  \ the way.\n\nThe journey, in distance, was a short one; but, if you let it, it\
  \ can take you a great distance into the local community, nature, and yourself.\
  \ \n\nThe pontoon ferry has since been replaced by a bridge, which has made crossing\
  \ the river quicker and easier for everyone.  But it also means a connection with\
  \ local life is less likely.  I'm happy the community finally has the bridge they\
  \ needed.  Without the ferry, though, I wouldn't have had the opportunity to know\
  \ anything of their lives, which is the part of the experience that makes visiting\
  \ Macaneta beach an especially treasured memory."
