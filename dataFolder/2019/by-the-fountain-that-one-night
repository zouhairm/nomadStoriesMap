Text: "The concept of travelling is quite the tricky one.  \nFor me, though, travelling\
  \ is the key to unlocking unique experiences for each one of us. When we travel,\
  \ not only do we find ourselves surrounded by foreign streets, culture, food, music,\
  \ and folklore, but with a thousand different things about ourselves we didn\u2019\
  t even know we were looking for in the first place.\nThese places and sensations\
  \ can be breathtaking, but they\u2019re nothing without their people.\nAnd I\u2019\
  m about to tell you why. \nAbout three years ago, I travelled up to Europe with\
  \ my mother and aunt. It was the trip of a lifetime\u2014the first time I would\
  \ cross the Atlantic Ocean and set foot in places like England, Belgium, Amsterdam,\
  \ France, Italy, and Spain\u2026 \nI daydreamed about endless activities I wanted\
  \ to do, so when I landed in London\u2019s airport at 3pm on that cool, July afternoon,\
  \ I felt like I was about to venture into a whole new world.\n(Pretty dramatic,\
  \ I know, but I won\u2019t pretend I wasn\u2019t excited.)\nEach one of the places\
  \ taught me small things about myself\u2014like the fact that eating Belgium waffles\
  \ at 11pm at night is never a good idea. But it wasn\u2019t until I got to Spain\
  \ that I realized why this trip felt so special to me. \nIt wasn\u2019t drinking\
  \ coffee at the caf\xE9 in Paris, or staring at the sun setting behind London\u2019\
  s buildings, or smelling an overload of weed in Amsterdam, or throwing a coin in\
  \ the Fontana Di Trevi, or any of the things I\u2019d wanted to do. \nIt was what\
  \ I saw at the fountain near Puerta del Sol at Madrid one of the last nights we\
  \ stayed there. \nAs I sat there at dinner, something caught my attention from across\
  \ the street. It was a lovely melody, strong cords, and a catchy pace. I listened\
  \ for about five minutes before turning around to look at the source of the music\u2014\
  and I was captivated the minute my eyes landed on it.\nSitting at the edge of the\
  \ fountain, was a young guy. His fingers moved perfectly over the string cords,\
  \ eyes staring up at the sky. I felt like I was looking at the scene of a movie.\
  \ Like at any given moment a girl would come rushing up to him to declare her love.\
  \ \nBut nothing remotely similar happened. \nHe stayed there for the remaining time\
  \ of my dinner, just playing\u2014not for money, since there weren\u2019t any visible\
  \ coin holders, but for his own satisfaction. \nAnd that\u2019s when I realized\
  \ I\u2019d been searching for the wrong things in this trip. I didn\u2019t need\
  \ to be at the top of the Eiffel Tower or visit the ruins at Stonehenge. Instead,\
  \ I had to pay attention to the people around me. \nWhat I saw in the eyes of that\
  \ guy\u2014and excuse how lame this will sound\u2014is exactly what I felt some\
  \ time later when I visited New York and found myself walking right in front of\
  \ the New York Times offices in the 8th avenue. \nAs I looked up at that grey building,\
  \ I stumbled into my own self-constructed universe, where nothing else mattered.\
  \ I didn\u2019t hear or see the ocean of people around me. I dreamed of a future\
  \ where I got to sit in one of the desks in an office up there and do what I\u2019\
  ve always dreamed of doing: writing.  \nWriting has always been a passion of mine,\
  \ regardless of whether I ever get to see one of my books on a library shelf or\
  \ not, and playing guitar was certainly that unknown guy\u2019s passion as well.\
  \ \nThe same glint I saw in his eyes is the one I feel taking over mine each time\
  \ my fingers dance on top of a keyboard. \nPerhaps you\u2019re looking for a funny,\
  \ amazing story, but that one night in Spain, looking at the guy staring at the\
  \ sky as he played his guitar, as if the world around him didn\u2019t exist, made\
  \ me realize the magic a place holds comes from the feelings it awakes in people.\n\
  And I would love to be able to find that with this opportunity."
