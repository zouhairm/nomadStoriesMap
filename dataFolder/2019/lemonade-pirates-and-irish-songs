Text: "The sound of the jungle was both beautiful and overwhelming. Night had fallen\
  \ and though I couldn\u2019t see a thing, the sounds were so loud I was sure to\
  \ be surrounded by hundreds of insects, frogs, lizards, monkeys and who knows what\
  \ else. I was alone and lost, sunk well past my knee level in a puddle of mud. I\
  \ wanted to do nothing more than run to a safe, cosy place and yet, that was particularly\
  \ difficult at the moment: every time I tried to move forward, my shoe would remain\
  \ stubbornly stuck at the bottom. And I couldn\u2019t walk through the jungle at\
  \ night without shoes, that part was clear to me. I was just thinking the situation\
  \ couldn\u2019t get any worse when in fact, it did; a slimy something touched the\
  \ exposed skin of my right leg making me scream.\nEverything started months before;\
  \ when by a funny accident I met this easy going, interesting Colombian guy. Before\
  \ I realized, we had been talking for over an hour. Even though that was his last\
  \ day in Mexico we spent a great afternoon together and decided to keep in touch\
  \ after he went back to his homeland. Sooner than later we found out we were in\
  \ love, so in love that I spent the next months saving money to go and visit him.\
  \ \nLittle did I know that the trip wasn\u2019t going to be quite as I imagined:\
  \ he was very kind but also a busy freelancer, so I ended up travelling alone most\
  \ the time. I have come to feel grateful about it, an amazing door was open before\
  \ me, one I maybe hadn\xB4t dared cross in different circumstances. When I look\
  \ back I can almost revive the feeling of uncertainty and expectation I had all\
  \ the time, that at the beginning freaked me out and by the end, had become almost\
  \ addictive. \nI must confess that despite I am an architect and Medellin is certainly\
  \ a beautiful city, what I miss the most is the lemonade. Lemons there are so gorgeously\
  \ fresh and sweet; they can transform simple lemonade into glory, as I discovered\
  \ when I bought my first glass in a street market, a little intimidated by the strong\
  \ looking brunet man who sold it to me. \nCartagena\xB4s historical city is of such\
  \ beauty, it feels like time is holding its breath, as if a ship would arrive at\
  \ any minute filled with treasures, chased by pirates. You can spend hours admiring\
  \ the harmony of the wooden balconies, the richness of the colours, the serenity\
  \ it all inspires. \nNevertheless, I won\u2019t ever forget Cartagena  was one of\
  \ the most important ports for slave trade nor that if you dare walk some blocks\
  \ away from downtown, as an startled me discovered, local people will hurriedly,\
  \ almost anxiously advice you to go back to a safe area.    \nBut the best was yet\
  \ to come. I left a piece of my soul (and almost both my shoes) at Tyrona Park.\
  \ I made a travel buddy there, crazy and daring who would climb trees to get fresh\
  \ coconuts and sing Irish ballades while walking in the middle of the jungle. If\
  \ I had had a choice, I would still be there, waking up in a hammock in a fresh\
  \ morning, surrounded by the chirping of tens of birds. \nColombia embraced me with\
  \ open arms, naive as I was, there were always good people who would give me advice\
  \ and help whenever I needed it. Like a little girl and her dad who accompanied\
  \ me all the way to the central bus station to keep me from harm, and that kind\
  \ hearted old man who found me lost and covered in mud in the middle of the jungle\
  \ and was so surprised of finding me there and so amazed for my happiness to see\
  \ him, that patiently guided me back to my camp. \nThere is so much to learn when\
  \ you travel, about the world and about yourself, that in fact I\xB4m certain you\
  \ find your strongest, most confident, creative and resourceful self when you valiantly,\
  \ unwisely and stubbornly dare to make a leap into the unknown."
