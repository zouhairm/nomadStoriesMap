Text: "This story is about tracking back to my ancestry from Java, especially Yogyakarta.\
  \ I was doing my thesis and do my field work practice on 2016. That was also the\
  \ day I realize that I have to find my own path and purpose. Yogyakarta, is the\
  \ city where my great great grandfather began his own story. And yes, my grandmother\
  \ also told me his story, that he was a part of the Yogyakarta Palace family, but\
  \ yet he decided to choose to become a common people literally. This is also the\
  \ thing that I am thankful for it, that I can do my own life as a person, in general.\
  \ Be united with normal life when there is no one do special things only for us,\
  \ respect another by their own way, be who I supposed tobe, and have an option to\
  \ choose what we should do in the right way anyway.\nOn the one night, some friends\
  \ and me, we were walking down the malioboro street and saw everything sparkling,\
  \ not only the lamps, but this life. Some traders were offering their products,\
  \ and some people also bought the things of course, but some people only asking\
  \ and passed through. Children also cried loudly because that was the time to go\
  \ sleep, but their parent keep begging for a peny from the foreigner that passed\
  \ through them. There is also a sound full of emotions, like debating or arguing\
  \ of something that I didnt know about. Some horses with the coachman were walking\
  \ in front of us, acrossing the zebra cross to pick some customer up. Well, it was\
  \ quite sad for me to see them honestly. The horse was tired already, so was the\
  \ coachman. \nIn the other day, I decided to go to the Tamansari, one of the legend\
  \ in Yogyakarta. That is a place contain with the pond and stairs. The most famous\
  \ story from the people is the biggest pond is the place where all goddess took\
  \ a bath. I also visited the Yogyakarta Palace, but my step just stopped in front\
  \ of the gate, the guardian told me there was a royal event that only attended by\
  \ the important person. That would be the day that I realize that we are only a\
  \ few people that do our needs and responsibility, to live, to survive and to win\
  \ this life for something that matter for us. This is not a judgement at all, but\
  \ I confess this is only a choice that everyone could have if they want to live\
  \ this life. I know we might be not a very famous person, or the most busy person\
  \ in the world, but one thing that I am so grateful for it is because I can live\
  \ this life with also my lack and special gift that I have. I could say if I have\
  \ a second chance to get a new life, I would choose tobe a person who has a choice\
  \ and be who I supposed tobe."
