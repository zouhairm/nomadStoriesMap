Text: "Growing up in Pakistan all i dreamt of was a visit to the well known \"A Heaven\
  \ on Earth\"(Kashmir). When finnaly deciding to put my dreams into reality, I took\
  \ the road going up towards Dhirkot, which meant an immediate uphill drive.Minutes\
  \ later when I reached a vantage point, I stopped the car and got out to look down\
  \ at Kohala Bridge to see the opposite bank of Jhelum River. There were scores of\
  \ vehicles and colorful umbrellas at the picnic-point on the Pakistani side, while\
  \ the Azad Kashmir end had only a couple of modest structures that served as stopover\
  \ facilities for mainly public buses and the occasional explorers like me.\nThree\
  \ things strike you as soon as you go deeper into Azad Kashmir: The breathtaking\
  \ natural beauty; the simple and friendly nature of its poverty-ridden people and\
  \ the pathetic condition of the roads and tourist facilities as compared to those\
  \ in the adjacent Pakistani region, or in Indian-held Kashmir for that matter.\n\
  On a map Azad Kashmir looks a small strip of land, however, since almost the entire\
  \ terrain is mountainous, travelling from one town to another can be a long, time-consuming\
  \ and meandering journey made worse due to the condition of the roads and the ever-present\
  \ danger of landslides. After an over two hours drive up and down winding roads\
  \ from Kohala, I decided to spend the night in Dhirkot, a small town roughly halfway\
  \ to Bagh.\nAccording to legend, an ascetic named Kashyapa reclaimed the land now\
  \ comprising Kashmir from a vast lake. That land came to be known as Kashyapamar\
  \ and, later, Kashmir. Buddhism was introduced by the Mauryan emperor Ashoka in\
  \ the 3rd century BCE, and from the 9th to the 12th century CE the region appears\
  \ to have achieved considerable prominence as a center of Hindu culture. A succession\
  \ of Hindu dynasties ruled Kashmir until 1346, when it came under Muslim rule. The\
  \ Muslim period lasted nearly five centuries, ending when Kashmir was annexed to\
  \ the Sikh kingdom of the Punjab in 1819 and then to the Dogra kingdom of Jammu\
  \ in 1846.\nFinding a place to spend the night became a challenge like in most small\
  \ towns in Pakistan. I was advised to try my luck at the forest rest house a couple\
  \ of kilometers away.\nThe caretaker/cook/sweeper/cashier (no receipts or paperwork\
  \ formalities here) and manager of the facility of this beautifully located classic\
  \ rest house was a short stout middle-aged man with darting eyes. The  walk in the\
  \ forest the following day, with its flora and fauna, as well as the simplicity\
  \ of the locals, who were not used to having tourists, was an exhilarating experience.\
  \ The latter part was so much fun that I decided to resume my Kashmir adventure\
  \ on public transport after returning the borrowed vehicle to my friends in Rawalpindi.\n\
  From Rawalpindi I took another route this time, through Kahuta to Rawlakot, which\
  \ is an important large town famous for its bowl shaped location. \nA mesmerizing\
  \ artificial lake at an altitude of 6,499 feet, Banjosa, is about an hour\u2019\
  s drive uphill from Rawlakot. Lush green hill forests tower over the lake. Journalist\
  \ and broadcaster Raza Ali Abidi\u2019s short story, Pankharian, a sensitively written\
  \ tale in the backdrop of the 1965 war, is set around this lake.\nLocated at the\
  \ confluence of rivers Neelam and Jehlum, Muzaffarabad is named after Sultan Muzzafar\
  \ Khan, a chief of the Bomba dynasty (1652). Its estimated population is 750,000,\
  \ and the city has a very attractive look due to the snake like Neelam River flowing\
  \ through and around the city. It is a large city with fine hotels and shopping\
  \ areas. The roads and infrastructure is better than the rest of the region. Since\
  \ roads are almost the only means of transportation in Azad Kashmir, there is a\
  \ large bus terminal in Muzaffarabad. That is where I found the wagon for my return\
  \ journey via Abbottabad. In conclusion, one can say that Azad Kashmir is a beautiful\
  \ place to visit, and even a little investment in infrastructure and tourist facilities\
  \ would go a long way towards reviving the economy of this picturesque, but neglected\
  \ region."
