Text: "All the sidewalks are made of small mosaics, white and black, this insignificant\
  \ detail can tell us so many sides of this place, some century\u2019s ago, this\
  \ country was a big colonial empire, today one of the tourist jewelries of Europe;\
  \ the mosaics are finished and a regular highway sidewalk starts, some meters ahead\
  \ I begin to notice the distant sound of the sea behind small mounds of earth.\n\
  \nA mass of water and the wind that reaches my face, to mi left Peniche, to my right\
  \ Baleal, to the front the Atlantic Ocean and on my back Europe. Make a pause, and\
  \ try to imagine being standing here couples of century ago, some big boats that\
  \ maybe were drawing the first map of the Iberian Peninsula, maybe there were on\
  \ their way to discover the Cape of Good Hope.\n\nThat adventure spirit took the\
  \ Lusitanian culture to discover and conquer territories all around the world, but\
  \ what about today, so lets turn around and go to European mass land, and our way\
  \ there\u2019s a town call Ferrel, good place to stop and eat, is about twenty to\
  \ thirty minutes from the beach, maybe there are to two or three thousands inhabitants,\
  \ so is a small place, its very quiet, few cars on the streets, you can stay still\
  \ for over twenty minutes and just a couple of dogs and a cat can cross in front\
  \ of you, but that is good, because give you time to contemplate the facades of\
  \ the houses, instead of paint they have big mosaics, somebody said to me that this\
  \ tradition come from Spain, I asked him, what you like of them? And the man respond\
  \ that living close to the see the salt corrode the paint, and also its cheaper\
  \ to have mosaics than paint need to be put again every two years at least. If they\
  \ come from Spain, I don't care. \n\nThe surroundings of Ferrel is a oak forest,\
  \ because of sand the soil is poor, but still there are good plantings of potatoes,\
  \ these abundance even give work to migrants that are maybe starting their trip\
  \ into Europe. Ferrel is more than just a small town with beautiful mosaics facades\
  \ and small restaurants; it is a place that is a symbol of the fight against nuclear\
  \ power plants. \n\nA fight that started in 1976 and ended in 1982 with the cancellation\
  \ and abandonment of this type of projects in this area of the country, since then\
  \ the discussion around if its good for Portugal to have or not nuclear energy,\
  \ is an unclear discussion. Perhaps this chapter is not well known worldwide, but\
  \ the fact that almost two thousand people took the power to decide what is best\
  \ for the the community, speaks of the spirit of these lands, in a way, the same\
  \ can be tell about the seeds of the potatoes that even the acid soil, potatoes\
  \ will grow strong enough to feed the community and its migrants. \n\nFrom the beach\
  \ to the forest, from the mosaics to the sandy paths, you sense all these with a\
  \ quick look over the mounds of earth to the oaks of the forest, among the streets\
  \ of Ferrel, and in the taste of the potatoes chips; you can only think that you\
  \ are in the right spot to start a great trip into the land well known as Europe."
