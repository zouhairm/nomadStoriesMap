  \ another ten seconds, if I could make it another ten seconds, and then another,\
  \ I would conquer the frigid wind that was trying to push me back down the slope\
  \ that I was slowly cycling up. \n\nThe wind in Patagonia is infamous among cycle\
  \ tourists as being incredibly fierce and unrelenting, and while I had yet to tackle\
  \ the worst of it, the steady 7 hours of headwind I had faced that day, cycling\
  \ through endless grey, naked paddocks was taking its toll on my brain and knees.\
  \ \n\n1234-\n\nWHOOP. WHOOP.\n\nI look in my mirror and see a car slowing down behind\
  \ me. I frustratedly gesture for them to overtake me as I continue wobbling up the\
  \ hill. \n\nWHOOP. WHOOP.\n\nThe siren sounds again, and with lights flashing, I\
  \ realise it is a police car. \n\nUh-oh. \nMy heart thuds and I stop. The police\
  \ car pulls up beside me and the man in the passenger seat winds down the window,\
  \ and looks me over. A young woman, alone, greasy, wearing as many clothes as a\
  \ human could and straddling a 30 kg bicycle laden with all her possessions.\n\n\
  Feeling vulnerable, my body is tense as I peer in and see the other five policemen\
  \ piled into the patrol car. Their freshly pressed uniforms and immaculately groomed\
  \ hair contrast with the way they are squished into the car, smiling, laughing and\
  \ pointing at my bike, giving them the amusing appearance of being stacked into\
  \ a clown car. \n\nDisarmed by their grins, I soften as they eagerly ask me questions\
  \ about my trip and tell me to stop by the police station, it\u2019s only 2 minutes\
  \ away they exclaim and overlapping voices start telling me about their amenities:\
  \ hot water, fire \u2026 after the first two I tune out, already lost in the daydream\
  \ of defrosting my fingers from my handlebars. \n\nIt takes me another hour and\
  \ half to climb the hill and from the top I spot the outpost of Morro Chico. Morro\
  \ Chico isn\u2019t a town, or village, in fact \u201CMorro Chico\u201D refers to\
  \ the large-ish flat-topped mountain which rises out of the bleak Patagonian plains\
  \ and marks the border between Chile and Argentina. Morro Chico is a dot on the\
  \ map: a police station, a shed and four cows. \n\nBut as I spotted smoke rising\
  \ out of the chimney, it seemed like home. \n\nI knocked on the door and they warmly\
  \ welcomed me, sat me down next to the stove and brought me an endless stream of\
  \ super sweet instant coffee. Using the computer to translate, we talked, laughed\
  \ and exchanged photos of our homes and families; all of us thousands of kilometres\
  \ away from the people we loved. \n\nOffering me a sheltered spot to camp opposite\
  \ the station, I retreated, smiling and warm, for an early night.\n\nThe next morning\
  \ I woke up, and stuck my head out of my tent, only to be greeted by two fluro-vested\
  \ policemen carrying heavy-duty rifles, happily waving at me from across the street,\
  \ and shouting my name. \n\nHeading back to the station, we drank mugs of coffee,\
  \ and watched Chilean soap operas in the tidy, well decorated living room as the\
  \ officers rotated in and out of patrol groups. As I was getting ready to head back\
  \ to my tent for an afternoon siesta, I pause. One of the policemen opens up a cupboard\
  \ and shakes out a black cape, draping it around the shoulders of one of the youngest\
  \ recruits, I watch, intrigued as he proceeds to give him one of the smartest haircuts\
  \ I have ever seen. I jokingly ask if I can have a trim (I was badly in need of\
  \ one). Everyone laughs.\n\n\u201CNo, but seriously, do you have time?\u201D \n\n\
  Out comes the cape and the mobile phones as I get a haircut, carefully documented\
  \ by 4 laughing Chilean policemen and a grinning Australian."
