Text: "Bus transfer from Bangkok International to Domestic. \nI was the last to board\
  \ thanks to my punctuality. I saw two empty seats, one at the window and the other\
  \ next to this girl in her mid twenties. Naturally, I chose the latter. \nA few\
  \ minutes past and I asked her what time it was. Cliche', yes  but often breaks\
  \ the ice and helps you decide if you vibe or not. \nAs it turns out, from the bus\
  \ to the Airport Gate, we were both headed to Phuket for the first time and we'd\
  \ exchanged numbers and decided to spend a day travelling around Phuket together.\
  \ What we did not know was how would this day unfold. \nThe next morning, I hired\
  \ a scooter and picked her up from her hotel. And following are the list of things\
  \ we did:\n\n1. Covered 6 different beaches along the Phuket shore trying banana\
  \ pancakes and singha beers.\n2. Got drenched on the highway thanks to unseasonal\
  \ rains.\n3. Swam at the highest waterfall of Phuket in the National park with no\
  \ other human in our field of sight\n4. Raced our scooter 70 kms south to catch\
  \ the sun set at 'Prom thep Cape'.\n5. Post sunset went to the Phuket walking Street\
  \ and drank more beers, met random travellers.  To end the day, I dropped her at\
  \ her hotel and left for Phi Phi islands the next day. \nShe was French, 'Celene'\
  \ was her name. We knew eachother for 48hours from the bus to the final goodbye.\
  \  But she gave me one of the best days of my life I would never forget. \n\nPS\
  \ : She's not even on social media. \nWhen I travel to France, in the hind sight\
  \ I'd look for her.  Sometime somewhere. Hoping our paths cross once again."
