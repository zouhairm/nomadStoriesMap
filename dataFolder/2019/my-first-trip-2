  \ but yes i had a advantage that one of my friend was in goa as he was doing his\
  \ industrial training of hotel management and was already their in goa from 4 months,\
  \ but still  i had  no expectation about how my trip would go .\n\nwell the journey\
  \ started in evening were i need to board my bus from Hyderabad from a place  called\
  \ \"paradise fire station\" well i was so excited that finally i was going out to\
  \ a tourist spot were every Indian wants to go once in their life time. Well i need\
  \ to board my bus at 2100 hrs but i dint knew that on the very first step i  had\
  \ a hurdle and  was due to traffic and by miss communication with the bus driver\
  \ i missed bus, but yes with out any adventure their is no meaning of a trip, well\
  \ how ever i had a word with the management regarding the issue and i was so lucky\
  \ that my issue was resolved really quick and i got an other bus at 2145 hrs, finally\
  \ i boarded the bus and my journey begin well it depend on the traveler that how\
  \ quick it can take you to panaji the capital of Goa , a few can drop you in 13\
  \ hrs and a max of 17 hrs. well the traveler i was travelling had a halt of 30 mins\
  \ twice once it was soon after getting on the highway that was basically for dinner\
  \ , and then  the next morning when i woke up i was in Belgium , basically the second\
  \ halt were you can do your breakfast and get fresh-n-up.\n\nnow it was morning\
  \ 10:30 hrs and finally i was in panaji, and yes i had my friend waiting for me\

  \ in bambolim . i was so excited that i just wanted to drop my bags and move out\
  \ and explore Goa, as i was tired by travelling i thought of moving out in evening,\n\
  \nAs i was fully charged and was all set to move out  i decided to go and move around\
  \ the city so i went to sant cruze a lovely place were the church bell gives you\
  \ a mesmerizing felling the silence in the church made me feel my internal soul\
  \  the ring of the church bell made me relax and then after sometime i moved from\
  \ their and was walking on the streets of the city as in every street i can see\
  \ a small church so positive vibe all around and the coconut tree shade all around.\
  \ day 1 was interesting as i was knowing the streets of goa but the fun was about\
  \ to begin,next day i started a bit early and went to the beaches of Goa the very\
  \ fist was baga beach, so much of fun activity could be done their as on every beach\
  \ we have water sport game available was really a beautiful place to sit had chill\
  \ then i covered calangute beach  and its a 15 -20 mins journey as it was afternoon\
  \ thought of getting back home at bambolim now it was evening and as i was moving\
  \ around alone so me and my friend decided to party so evening around 19:00 we decided\
  \ to go anjuna beach a happening place were i could find a maximum people.\n\nThe\
  \ movement we step in anjuna beach  in a row i could see shag and the best shag\
