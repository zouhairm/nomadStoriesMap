Text: "It was the beginning of August, but I hadn't expected Scotland to be as hot\
  \ as it was back home. Edinburgh, despite my visions of grey skies and rain-slicked\
  \ cobblestones and crowds of umbrellas, was sweltering. To make it worse, the heat\
  \ wave had come in with the tide of attendees for the Fringe Festival. Everywhere\
  \ was packed, everyone was hot, and the day had only just begun.\n\nI would only\
  \ be spending the one day in Edinburgh, so my friend and I moved with the swarm\
  \ towards the Royal Mile, determined to see as much as we could. Specifically, as\
  \ millennials, we had a few Harry Potter-themed goals in mind.\n\nThe first of these\
  \ was the Elephant House, the caf\xE9 where J.K. Rowling reportedly worked on the\
  \ first drafts of Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone. Naturally, we felt we\
  \ just had to see it. Unfortunately, it seemed half of the city's tourists had the\
  \ same idea. The caf\xE9 is situated on George IV Bridge, in the middle of Edinburgh's\
  \ Old Town. The sidewalk, while far from narrow, was perhaps not built with the\
  \ supernatural knowledge that, one day, large groups of Italian exchange students\
  \ would be milling about outside, waiting to get a picture of the gleaming red facade\
  \ of a single small business that was already glutted with patrons.\n\nIt seemed\
  \ we would be unable to even get close to the building for some time. We debated\
  \ finding another, quicker, route to the Royal Mile, where the rest of our sightseeing\
  \ stops would be.\n\nBut when we drew as close as we could to the Elephant House,\
  \ we saw a Gothic building to our left with a sign reading \"The World Famous Frankenstein\
  \ & Bier Keller.\"\n\n\"Frankenstein?\" my friend read with interest. \"That could\
  \ be fun.\" The two of us were fans of horror and early novels, but more importantly,\
  \ we were overheated and needed to kill some time.\n\nThe moment we stepped inside,\
  \ we were met with a welcome rush of air-conditioning, the first we had encountered\
  \ in the UK. The pub itself was dazzling. The lighting was a mixture of soft orange,\
  \ like that of candlelight, and a sour-apple green that rang of Halloween parties.\
  \ Black-and-white Frankenstein movies played on large screens while plasma ball\
  \ lamps of various colours brought on the spooky old-school sci-fi feel.\n\nThe\
  \ highlights of the menu were the themed cocktails. While the best name was awarded\
  \ to the \"Bloody Mary Shelley,\" the drink surprisingly was not a twist on a traditional\
  \ Bloody Mary, but was instead a sweet, fruity drink with Amaretto and grenadine.\
  \ We very nearly paired that with the haggis croquettes before wisely deciding against\
  \ such an unholy union.\n\nFirst-timers might not know this\u2014we certainly didn't,\
  \ after all\u2014but occasionally the Frankenstein puts on a delightful surprise\
  \ show. Some of the lights dim while others flash false lightning across the bar,\
  \ and chilling organ music blares. From a hidden chamber high above the tables,\
  \ a bed of metal bars extends and is lowered down toward the thirsty pub patrons.\
  \ Upon it lies a large, familiar body. The suspended body lurches up and forward,\
  \ looking eerily about, as if truly brought to life, and some people do give a start\
  \ in their seats at the unexpected movement. \n\nThis might not have been the kind\
  \ of chill we originally sought out when we ducked in for a drink, but we had no\
  \ complaints.\n\nAs theme bars go, this was one of the coolest (literally, too).\
  \ It fit in perfectly with its Old Town location, right in between the Greyfriars\
  \ Kirkyard, which is rife with ghost stories, and the Elephant House caf\xE9, the\
  \ self-proclaimed \"birthplace of Harry Potter.\" It was a delightful discovery\
  \ of something so quintessentially Edinburgh.\n\nWe did end up getting a couple\
  \ pictures of the Elephant House, but our surprise trip to the Frankenstein more\
  \ than made up for the wait. Everyone knows you can't plan for everything when travelling,\
  \ but sometimes forgetting the plan can work out better. A new city can always surprise\
  \ you, if you let it."
