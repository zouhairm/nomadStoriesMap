Text: "It\u2019s incredibly difficult to fathom reality and thoughts. Merge the two\
  \ together to make one, but essentially thats what leads one to self-discovery.\
  \ Even without realizing, your life changes, evolves, not by choice but by fate.\n\
  \tMy story start with knowing, or thinking that I knew, who I was, where my life\
  \ would lead and what choices I had to make for a secure future. As a Hungarian\
  \ immigrant to Canada, where the average living conditions, the middle-class lifestyle,\
  \ was dramatically different and much less bountiful, a secure future was the goal.\
  \ I thought I had to follow the path my parents had imagined for their children;\
  \ go to university, get a degree, get a job and find a partner, get promotions and\
  \ get married, buy a house and have children, grow old together in a suburban house\
  \ while taking the kids to school and soccer practice, eventually watching them\
  \ go to university while you grow old, all this with a few hiccups along the way\
  \ because what\u2019s life without unforeseen circumstances.\n\tThis was the goal,\
  \ the ideal, or so I was told. But that cannot possibly all that life has to offer\
  \ and to discover. Mostly not for a girl who has always been drawn to exploring\
  \ and the taking the difficult, less popular, path. \n\tMy story started in Australia\
  \ but really begun to clarify in Fiji.\n\tFiji was, by no means, a culture shock\
  \ and exotic and my childhood dream destination. Fiji was everything I had imagined\
  \ - endless seafood, beaches, and pina colada\u2019s lying in a hammock watching\
  \ the sunset.  It was incredible, but not what struck me at the core, at the heart..\
  \ \n\tSo what exactly changed this? There\u2019s no real answer, but it was like\
  \ a part of me, locked behind a wall and itching to come out, finally had felt safe\
  \ and ready. I went off-track the regular resorts and immersed myself into the culture\
  \ and villages, at least as best as a traveller could. I had begun to know the locals\
  \ who humbly accepted me into their world for the short while. The interactions\
  \ with some of the worlds most giving people, who had little to give in such an\
  \ impoverished country, had resonated so strongly with me that I had finally let\
  \ that inner wall slip and crack.\n\tI\u2019ll tell you one story. It was April\
  \ in Fiji, cyclone season. There was one passing off the coast of Fiji during my\
  \ stay, and I was in the Coral Coast, where the cyclone was expected to come closest\
  \ to the land. We had no cell connection and no wifi, so no phone for days. I had\
  \ been in a hostel with other travellers and a group tour was there as well. We\
  \ were all talking and laughing and drinking kava. When you drink kava, a traditional\
  \ Fijian root ground up and mixed with water to make a drink, like tea, you sit\
  \ in a circle and one at a time the \u201Cchief\u201D hands you to bowl and you\
  \ clap, say \u201Cbula\u201D, drink the bowl and everyone claps 3 times after. So\
  \ there we were, drinking kava in a big group, and two girls beside me were on there\
  \ phones. One turns to the other and asks, \u201Care you connected to the wifi -\
  \ is your phone working yet?\u201D And it was at that moment that the first thought\
  \ that came to mind was: why does it matter? why are people on their phones? why\
  \ aren\u2019t you enjoying the moment? the precious times in life where you can\
  \ sit and connect with people, and a culture? I remember just being grateful to\
  \ be there, in the moment, not worrying about social media, my phone and just being\
  \ in the moment. \n\tI think that\u2019s when it really hit me, this was what I\
  \ want in life, the precious moments with people, immersed in a culture and their\
  \ land. That\u2019s who I was then, who I wanted to be in the future and the version\
  \ of me that I felt most in-tune with. It was the feeling of home in a place so\
  \ foreign to me, where I unfound myself to find myself at home."
