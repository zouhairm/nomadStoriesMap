Text: "Sometimes the best travel stories are found closer to home. Don\u2019t get\
  \ me wrong, I am a strong advocate of going out and seeing the world. There is so\
  \ much out there to be seen, so many places to explore, cultures to immerse yourself\
  \ into and experiences to be had. It\u2019s a big world out there. But you mustn\u2019\
  t dismiss the experiences you can have in your own country. \n\nMy story starts\
  \ as many travel experiences do. With a spontaneous decision. I thought to myself,\
  \ \u201CHey, there\u2019s a 12 hour music festival happening at Parramatta Park\
  \ today. Maybe I should go.\u201D \n\nWithin 30 minutes, I made the decision to\
  \ attend Sydney\u2019s Download Festival, purchased a ticket and was out the door.\
  \ Download Festival is an annual punk rock and metal festival which originated in\
  \ the UK and is only gracing Australia with its presence for the second time. It\
  \ brought legendary punk powerhouses like Pennywise and Sum 41, and metal veterans\
  \ such as Slayer and Anthrax, together with a great deal of local Australian Talent\
  \ like Luca Brasi and Frenzal Rhomb.\n\nFirst impression, I wasn\u2019t wearing\
  \ nearly enough black. It was a sea of black clothing and band shirts. I have never\
  \ felt so out of place in my life. Me, the over thinker, the man that plans for\
  \ every eventuality, dressed in clothes that might be acceptable to go out to the\
  \ city after. So it\u2019s clear to say I felt quite out of place in my burgundy\
  \ shorts, navy shirt and bomber jacket. My worries were soon put to rest when I\
  \ was caught up in the atmosphere. I\u2019m a massive music fan, and I was in my\
  \ element. \n\nThe food stalls were in abundance, offering delicacies from around\
  \ the globe. They offered Turkish gozleme, Greek pita, German sausages, American\
  \ burgers and more. The average amount you\u2019d spend on a meal is between $15\
  \ and $20, which is comparable to a meal in the city or any food at a similar event.\
  \ There were pop up bars offering draught beers, ciders and some other fun beverages.\
  \ The charging stations for us with no cell life was a welcome sight. \n\nThe free\
  \ water refills were great. You could bring in an empty plastic bottle and have\
  \ unlimited fee water for the day. Many people who go to day festivals are prone\
  \ to dehydration so I\u2019m glad this was implemented at Download. Luckily, the\
  \ weather was cool and cloudy. I feel like I really would have struggled on a hot,\
  \ sunny day.\n\nAn addition to the festival that I really liked was the \u201CSave\
  \ a Mate\u201D Tent. If someone was sick, injured, dehydrated, drunk or just not\
  \ feeling themselves, they could be brought to this tent where they would be taken\
  \ care of and just able to chill out until they\u2019ve recovered. It\u2019s a good\
  \ way to help keep festivals safe, and I am happy that it was there.\n\nThe music\
  \ itself was amazing. I came to this festival on my own which gave me the freedom\
  \ to go and see whoever I wanted to see. My highlights were Rise Against, Sum 41,\
  \ The Amity Affliction, I Prevail and Redhook. I had never been at the front of\
  \ the crowd before and for all of these performances I was front and centre, screaming\
  \ my lungs out along with the crowd to some of the best punk songs on the planet\
  \ (a claim I\u2019m willing to defend).\n\nI didn\u2019t expect to find myself having\
  \ such a good time. I was on my own, I didn\u2019t know anyone and I only knew a\
  \ few of the bands that were playing. But I am so glad I took this opportunity to\
  \ go. I saw all the bands I wanted to see and even discovered new bands I never\
  \ would have given a chance. As soon as I got home I saved all of my favourite artists\
  \ of the day on my Spotify for future reference. If there is something you want\
  \ to do but you are not too sure about it, give it a chance. I had a much better\
  \ time than I would have if I was at home on a Saturday."
