Text: "\u201CNo, Mary. That\u2019s the Gap of Dunloe, Mary.\u201D\n\nThe words are\
  \ spoken in exasperation by the elderly man behind the wheel. If I had to guess,\
  \ I\u2019d say he\u2019s 80, maybe even 85 years old. His wife, seated next to him,\
  \ is clearly Mary \u2013 and clearly won\u2019t let it go. \n\n\u201CI really do\
  \ think you should have turned right.\u201D\n\nTheir bickering continues but there\u2019\
  s a fondness underlying every word. I try to imagine how many years they must have\
  \ been married. \n\nDespite having only been in County Kerry for four days and only\
  \ a total of two weeks in Ireland, I know that the husband, Thomas, is correct.\
  \ Had he turned right, he would\u2019ve headed straight for the Gap of Dunloe and\
  \ not our joint destination, Killarney. The reason I know this is because I walked\
  \ to the Gap the day before accompanied by my boyfriend, who shares the backseat\
  \ of their old Ford with me.\n\nAnd because we just drove past a huge sign saying\
  \ as much.\n\nI decide it\u2019s wise to stay out of their argument and equally\
  \ wise to avoid looking at my boyfriend\u2019s face lest we both burst into laughter.\n\
  \nThe hilarity of the situation is perhaps exaggerated by our exhaustion, but it\
  \ is also owed to the couple\u2019s thick Irish accents, which we find amusing \u2013\
  \ and absolutely adore.\nLooking to distract myself, I peer at the car display.\
  \ It\u2019s currently 5 o\u2019clock in the morning.\n\nWhen we first set out from\
  \ our Airbnb at Carrauntoohil it was 4:30, and we were looking at a two and a half\
  \ hour walk to the nearest bus stop. Desperately hoping to shorten our travel time,\
  \ I stuck out my thumb at every passing car. \n\nLet me tell you; the roads are\
  \ pretty deserted at that hour in rural Ireland.\n\nExactly one car passed us in\
  \ thirty minutes. \n\nHe didn\u2019t stop. \n\nBut suddenly there was the old Ford\
  \ carrying Mary and Thomas, who rolled down his window and told us to get in despite\
  \ our state as dirty, tired hikers, each carrying a huge rucksack, and despite the\
  \ fact that the backseat was already occupied by a freshly ironed blazer and two\
  \ exceedingly white wedding invitations.\n\nIt felt almost sacrilegious to rest\
  \ my muddy boots on the carpet of their flawless beige interior. I think maybe Mary\
  \ felt the same, snatching those invitations as quickly as she did. \nThomas is\
  \ not faced at all and very chatty. Within a short while, he learns that we\u2019\
  re from Denmark, that before visiting County Kerry, we\u2019ve been to Dublin, County\
  \ Wicklow, and Galway, and that we\u2019ve been staying in a tent at Carrauntoohil.\n\
  \n\u201CRemember the tent in Galway, Mary.\u201D \n\nIt\u2019s a statement more\
  \ than a question. Of course, she remembers. \n\nThe Gap of Dunloe is well in the\
  \ past now. A tent in Galway, courtesy of their youth, becomes the present.\n\n\u201C\
  We were supposed to camp near the lake, but you took one look at the tent and refused\
  \ to set foot inside.\u201D Thomas recounts the story with amusement thick in his\
  \ voice.\n\nMy boyfriend adds, equally amused, that I\u2019m not fond of tents either.\
  \ Though I can\u2019t argue with the fact, I still give him the side-eye for selling\
  \ me out.\n\n\u201CWhy sleep in a tent when you can stay in a house.\u201D Mary\
  \ retorts.\n \nI nod in agreement and forgive her earlier transgression with the\
  \ road sign. \n\n\u201CWe did end up staying in a hotel,\u201D he concedes and tells\
  \ us of a matronly hostess who forbade them from sleeping in the same bed because\
  \ they were unwed. \n\u201CBut we did it anyway!\u201D \n\nI swear I catch a twinkle\
  \ of mischief in both their eyes from the rear-view mirror. From what I know of\
  \ 1960s Ireland, it must have taken guts to break from the norm.\n\nThe car comes\
  \ to a halt, and we exchange our goodbyes. Thomas and Mary are off to their wedding;\
  \ we\u2019ll soon be back home.\n\nAs we lift our bags and prepare to head downtown,\
  \ I turn to my boyfriend and put on my best Irish accent.\n\n\u201CNo, Mary! That\u2019\
  s the Gap of Dunloe, Mary!\u201D\n\nAnd just like that, all the pent-up laughter\
  \ comes pouring out."
