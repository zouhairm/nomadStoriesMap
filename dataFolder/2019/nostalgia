Text: "On a Saturday afternoon, Maura and I drive to Strasbourg. I am seeing her for\
  \ the first time in 9 years on a visit to Europe between jobs. As we fill in the\
  \ gaps between who we were in 2009 and who we are in 2018, we both remember a decade-old\
  \ conversation with another friend when Maura was going through tough times. Maura\
  \ had said to us, \u201CI just wish I had it together like you do.\u201D This friend\
  \ and I had exploded into laughter at the idea that we had it together.\n\n\u201C\
  Do you think we will ever feel like we have it together?\u201D I ask.\n\n\u201C\
  I think we see now that life is messy, even for people who appear to \u2018have\
  \ it together.'\u201D\n\nStrasbourg has meaning for both of us: we each studied\
  \ abroad here in college, though not together. It\u2019s been 17 years since I set\
  \ foot in Strasbourg, and I have ferociously guarded my sense of it as an idyllic\
  \ place that launched my love for travel. I\u2019m excited to return and nervous\
  \ that it won\u2019t live up to my sentimental memory-feelings. We reach Strasbourg\
  \ on a beautiful sunny afternoon, and I expect my heart to trip over itself with\
  \ adoration and warm, nostalgic memories.\n\nWe sit silently for the first few minutes.\n\
  \n\u201CI don\u2019t recognize anything,\u201D Maura admits.\n\nI agree with a deep\
  \ sadness. \u201CNothing feels familiar.\u201D\n\nWe walk across covered bridges,\
  \ through streets with timbered tall houses, to the famous Cathedral. We eat choucroute\
  \ and meander around the Parc Orangerie. Still no tripping hearts.\n\nStudying here\
  \ in 2001, I lived with a wonderful host family. When I flew to Strasbourg from\
  \ the US, I miscalculated my arrival time and showed up at their building door in\
  \ a cold January rain, several hours before they were expecting me. Maura and I\
  \ found their apartment building- I wonder if they still live here, 17 years later.\
  \ A distant, fleeting flicker of familiarity leaves me feeling more empty.\n\nMaura\
  \ drives home Sunday morning. I push down my sadness as I say goodbye. I wait to\
  \ see her car pull out, delaying the goodbye as long as possible. As I walk back\
  \ toward the downtown, I am desperately trying to turn everything I see into something\
  \ familiar. Have I been on this corner before? Is THAT the patisserie where I used\
  \ to get almond croissants every day around 4pm? I feel cut off from my previous\
  \ experience in Strasbourg and from everyone I know who is not here.\n\nI finally\
  \ realize what I\u2019m seeking so desperately. I want to feel what it was like\
  \ to be 20 years old on a trip I now knew would have huge significance in my life.\
  \ Before 9/11, in a world that felt safer, when I could hold the illusion that people\
  \ can \u201Chave it together,\u201D when my parents were both still alive and lived\
  \ in my hometown, when I didn\u2019t worry about student loans or getting a good\
  \ job or adult responsibilities. I want to travel back in time for however long\
  \ the gods will give me to feel lighter. I also realize this is impossible and it\
  \ is keeping me from enjoying this charming town for what it is, today.\n\nWhen\
  \ I relax and walk around, I find some places that feel familiar. I enter the university\
  \ to find a restroom and immediately recognize hallways I walked down and a green,\
  \ earthy atrium. I find the patisserie around 4pm and eat my croissant en amande\
  \ in Place Kleber. I stumble upon a nightclub we visited, Le Salamandre, which I\
  \ note doesn\u2019t open until 11pm and then only on the weekends. I salute my young\
  \ self's stamina and ability to dance with abandon, and then keep walking.\n\nAs\
  \ I pass the statue in Place Kl\xE9ber for the last time, I wonder whether it will\
  \ still be here in another 17 years. The world felt open and optimistic when I studied\
  \ here; now it feels darker. Maybe the world hasn\u2019t actually changed, but 17\
  \ years of life experience has darkened me. In any case, I miss my version of Strasbourg\
  \ before I\u2019ve even left."
