Text: "Malarial dreams descend once more.  Vivid people-filled imaginings float in\
  \ with each       \nNew Orleans heat wave, swirl around in the ceiling fan\u2019\
  s vortex, and land on my brain. \n     Under the heaviness of Louisiana air, why\
  \ NOT this more flamboyant answer to How ya coping \nwith da heat?  \n     Evenings\
  \ medicating with the required potent doses of tonic water, its quinine mixed with\
  \ more \nthan a touch of gin. \n                                               \
  \                _______________________________\n1983, Zaire\n     Prophylactic\
  \ tablets offer insufficient protection while camping at the Salvation Army\ncompound\
  \ in Kinshasa. Hungry Anopheles mosquitoes overpower the milligrams of chloroquine,\
  \ \nresulting in nausea, depleted energy, and a thumping headache.\n     The mission\
  \ commander hurries me into her air-cooled house, handing over a suppository\nto\
  \ stop the vomiting.  She efficiently pokes my butt with a shot of Vitamin B6, averting\
  \ her \neyes from my raggedy underwear.  Therapeutic doses of quinine pills follow.\
  \ \n     Many locals without access to meds cycle through waves of malaria, coping\
  \ with chills, fever, \nand delirium until the parasites subside.\n     My high\
  \ fever abates over several days of intense sleep studded with vibrant visions.\
  \ \n     Restored energy allows onward travel, so we climb aboard the next cargo\
  \ truck heading east.\n     A fee is charged per kilometer based on destination,\
  \ paid in full and dropped directly into the \ndriver\u2019s hands.  Brown-skinned\
  \ Paul and I are the only outsiders, joining twelve passengers perched atop\nempty\
  \ beer bottles and bulging burlap sacks of dried fish. We grab on to anything stable,\
  \ swaying with \nthe truck as the massive tires grind up the red mud road\n    \
  \ The air droops, and often spills over with steamy drizzle.  Fetid odors rise up\
  \ from the puddles.\n     The road wobbles through seemingly impenetrable forest,\
  \ until\u2026a clearing pops out.  A woman bent \nover a wooden stick pounds a bowl\
  \ of manioc root into powdery flour.  A pot of water for tea boils over \na smoky\
  \ fire.  A red brick chapel brims with drumming and hymns.\n     Stopping at dusk\
  \ we gobble rice and meat in a caf\xE9, dining with a fellow rider.  Twenty-year\
  \ old \nSulmani wants to study in France.  Hearing our cheap travel tales, his eyes\
  \ widen with possibilities. \n     The caf\xE9 owner slams something down, offering\
  \ his own comment.\n     Sulmani frowns with us at the distasteful descriptive \u201C\
  tourists\u201D and announces,\n          No!  They are travelers!\n     Unimpressed,\
  \ the owner mutters, and keeps banging pots.\n     Passengers sleep on the truck\
  \ along with the marketable items, covered by a heavy canvas \ntarp to repel possible\
  \ rainfall.  The stuffy darkness is full of body odors.  Along with the smell of\
  \ dried \nfish and the ubiquitous goat aboard, it is beyond awful.  I crawl to an\
  \ edge to poke my head out, \npreferring splashing rain to the claustrophobic stink.\n\
  \     In the morning the driver rips off the tarp.  The truck rumbles in fresh sunshine\
  \ through clouds of \nbutterflies, colored wings  brushing our faces.  Swarms of\
  \ iridescent flies reflect the light.\n     By early afternoon we are eager to gather\
  \ a feast from roadside vendors.  A few mandazi, fried dough \nballs tasting of\
  \ dense palm oil.  A hunk of smoked dik-dik antelope sold from a hunter\u2019s sack.\
  \  We share \nwith Sulmani, who offers sweet bananas.\n     Pushing on through sticky\
  \ air, our heads nod with warm lethargy, until abruptly, the truck stops.\n    \
  \ The wiry driver scampers up over the bundles.  Inflamed, his eyes furious, he\
  \ confronts a passenger \nwho has overstayed the prepaid distance.  There are no\
  \ coins in his pockets, and it is too late to kick him \noff.  The argument in loud\
  \ Lingala does not last long, as the driver snatches a shiny watch in payment.\n\
  \      Exhausted, his anger spent, the driver moans,\n      The malaria is back\u2026\
  \nclimbing down to lay out flat under drooping tree branches.\n                \
  \                                      ______________________________________\n\
  \     Back in our own warm latitudes, we sink into the climate.  Open windows, screen\
  \ doors, and \nless clothing.  Ice-cold foot soaks and alcohol rubdowns to cool\
  \ the skin.\n     Under stubbornly still wind chimes, visiting friends balk on the\
  \ front porch threshold, and decide to \ncome back in winter.\n     Brown-skinned\
  \ Paul eventually leaves me for an air-conditioned girlfriend.\n     I remain barely\
  \ clad, sweat pooling in crevices, succumbing nightly to heat-soaked reveries."
