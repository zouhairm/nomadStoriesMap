Text: "The Unknown \nby Gina McClifty\n\nFEAR: Defined as an emotion that nobody wants\
  \ to discuss, or even acknowledge.\n\nFear of being alone. Fear of change. Fear\
  \ of the unknown. It can be seriously excruciating. Excuse me, I think I need to\
  \ rewind the clock to a very specific, vivid moment in time. A moment I haven't\
  \ mentioned to anyone.\n\n12/01/2018\n\nFor as long as I can remember, I have always\
  \ had immense confidence in my independence. I love being alone, enjoy the challenge\
  \ of working independently, and always craved having my own space. I never could\
  \ have predicted the feeling that hit me the last time I saw my family.\n\nI like\
  \ to refer to that feeling as, crippling fear.\n\nAfter Christmas holidays together\
  \ in Europe, my entire family was flying home. \n\nAnd I made, the decision to travel\
  \ solo to Manchester for 10 days, then travel South Africa for an unspecific amount\
  \ of time. I brought this situation upon myself. But still, I had no idea the amount\
  \ of emotions I would feel over the space of a day.\n\nWe drove to the airport.\n\
  \nThen I was crazy excited.\n\nThen it was time for me to board.\n\nThen my boarding\
  \ pass was scanned.\n\nThen turned around and smiled at my family.\n\nBoom, I felt\
  \ like I couldn't breathe.\n\nFrom the moment I started walking down the corridor\
  \ to board the plane, my stage five freak out began. The flight was about 90 minutes,\
  \ and every one of those was spent trying not to have an intensely embarrassing\
  \ public breakdown. And it certainly doesn't help when your music library is the\
  \ nationally accredited playlist of emotional acoustic bangers. Thankfully, painfully,\
  \ and not without excessive squirming in my seat, I survived the flight. Straight\
  \ from a mini emotional breakdown, we dove face first into defensive overdrive.\
  \ The entire trip from baggage claim to the AirBnB, my predatory lookout skills\
  \ were heightened. Even a clearly reputable taxi driver received some serious stand-off\
  \ vibes. Sorry dude.\n\nIn retrospect, it probably wasn't the best idea to get an\
  \ AirBnB all to myself. I was sitting alone in a tiny apartment in absolute distraught.\
  \ I was crippled by an overwhelming amount of emotions. In between the dramatic\
  \ tears and the blind rage of not buying a U.K. adapter to charge everything I needed\
  \ to survive, I realised that this was probably a very big moment in my life. I\
  \ don't know how I had this epiphany, but it was very clear. Either I crumble under\
  \ the weight of it all, or I stand up. Somewhere beneath all of the fear, I knew\
  \ there was intention and clear purpose.\n\nI was there for a reason.\n\nSo, not\
  \ only did I MacGyver an adapter out of my bottomless bag of tangled camera and\
  \ laptop cords (seriously, don't ask me how), but I managed to persevere the emotional\
  \ storm. In between binge watching Friends on Netflix and binge eating Peanut M&M's\
  \ (not sponsored), I made it through the night; no impulse buying a flight home\
  \ or anything.\n\nAnd when I woke up, I laughed. I remember thinking, \"Man, I overreacted\
  \ last night. I'm glad nobody saw me. LOL.\"\n\nBut when I look back on it, holy\
  \ shit. What an important moment.\n\nNever did I think that fear could be so challenging,\
  \ yet so empowering at the same time. \n\nSo, to everyone that is afraid of something.\
  \ Please remember that nobody is perfect. Nobody has complete faith in themselves.\
  \ There is an abundance of fear and self-doubt in the world. It is okay to experience\
  \ a thousand emotions in a day. It is okay to feel lonely, to feel homesick, to\
  \ miss someone. It is okay to change your mind. It is okay to freak out. There is\
  \ a purpose behind every situation. You are supposed to be there, no matter how\
  \ emotional or hard it feels. Try to look past the momentary fear and see the meaning.\
  \ \n\nThere will always be some element of fear within the unknown.\n\nBut the unknown\
  \ is there to be explored,\n\nto find comfort in,\n\nAnd with which to flourish."
