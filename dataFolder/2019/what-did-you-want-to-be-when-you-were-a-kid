Text: "Psychologists say, that our wishes are the sincerest in the childhood. Kids\
  \ know what they want from this life. They know what they want to be. They know\
  \ how to be happy. They know how to make other people happier.\nLater, society imposing\
  \ its` opinions. And we forget about our sincere wishes. We forget about our character.\
  \ We forget how to be happy. We forget how to make this world better\nBut if we\
  \ dive into the childhood, we will remember everything. We will understand what\
  \ we should be, which profession we should choose and how we can be useful to others.\n\
  \u2026\u2026\u2026\n\n10/08/2013\n- Arina, what did you want to be when you were\
  \ a kid?\n- Mmm I don`t remember. Maybe a singer or dancer.. Haha, all normal girls\
  \ wanted to have this profession, right? \U0001F60A\n\n12/08/2013\nI went abroad\
  \ first time in my life. It was ERASMUS intercultural exchange for Ukrainian, Polish\
  \ and German students. We arrived to a little village near Berlin and met other\
  \ people.\n\nI met many fears there\nI had a language barrier, but continued to\
  \ speak English.\nI was afraid to meat people of other cultures. Maybe we could\
  \ understand each other wrong. But I continued to speak.\nI was afraid to travel\
  \ alone. I thought, that if my close friends and parents are not near, it means\
  \ that I`m lonely.\nI was afraid of being outcast\nI was afraid of being cheated\n\
  I was afraid\u2026\n\n\n20/08/2013\nSitting in the circle with 30 people of different\
  \ cultures, I understood how stupid I were one week ago. How stupid my fears were.\n\
  Together with other students, we talked a lot. We played a lot. We had fun a lot.\
  \ We became a big family. Even despite that fact that we knew each other only for\
  \ one week, we became a REAL family!\nDo you know how great this feeling is? I felt\
  \ it first time in my life. And I still remember how exciting it was.\n\n21/08/2013\n\
  Big group of intercultural friends is sitting near the fire and talking about life.\n\
  I`m looking at the fire and almost don`t hear what happens around.\n- Arina? Arina!\n\
  - Ah? (I`m taking my eyes of the fire)\n- And you? What did you want to be when\
  \ you were a kid?\n(My heartbeat speeds up)\n- Mmmm.. A traveler! I wanted to be\
  \ a traveler!\nI wanted to see all the world. I wanted to meet other people. I wanted\
  \ to face my fears. I wanted to show that everything is possible. I wanted to inspire\
  \ people to change their lives to the best. I wanted to help their wishes to come\
  \ true.\n\nI didn`t expect to find the answer for this question there, 1816 km far\
  \ from house\nBut now, on 28/02/2019, I know. Traveling is a best way to find all\
  \ answers."
