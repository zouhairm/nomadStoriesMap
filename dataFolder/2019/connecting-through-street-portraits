Text: "When I look at the work of other photographers I gauge my own responses to\
  \ see where potential unexplored interests lie. And it took me a surprisingly long\
  \ time to connect enough dots to realize that I have a tremendous interest in portraiture.\
  \ Not the stiff sort of studio portraits that I'd shoot during my short time as\
  \ a studio photographer, though those hold a certain fascination for me as well.\
  \ No, portraits with a backdrop of everyday life, in whatever form that takes for\
  \ the subject(s) in question. Be it the streets of Mumbai to Sao Paulo, street portraits\
  \ offered me a new window into the world of travel photography. \n\nStreet portraiture\
  \ is a lesson in connection. When I first decided I'd go and try shooting street\
  \ portraits I drove downtown, paid for parking, and very nearly psyched myself out\
  \ of my first day. The idea of walking around taking portraits, both in collaboration\
  \ with strangers and candidly, was incredibly intimidating. I'm reminded of an article\
  \ by photographer and writer Kirk Tucker titled \"The Passion is in the Risk.\"\
  \ Here, Kirk lays out how taking risks, from street photography to the very idea\
  \ of working as an artist, is inspired by the passion you feel for your art. And\
  \ he compares two images. The first is of three baggage handlers in Italy who aren't\
  \ very appreciative of him photographing them. One man wags a finger in his direction,\
  \ telling him to get lost. The second is a far safer image of a woman clearly absorbed\
  \ in a newspaper and a man with his back turned. Kirk's words on the second image:\
  \ \"There's no engagement.  There's little passion.  And when you look at this image\
  \ you tend to pass it by because it's something you've seen a hundred or a thousand\
  \ times before from every photographer who shoots in the street.  There's little\
  \ reward because there's little risk.  And without the risk there's no passion.\
  \  And the passion is what gets transmitted to the viewer.\"\n\nGranted, it was\
  \ by looking at portraits taken from a place of risk that had me standing on the\
  \ streets of Charlotte. I knew that there was passion in the risk even before I\
  \ started talking myself out of shooting. But what I found surprising was that I\
  \ could shoot despite the feeling. That I would build up momentum, step by step,\
  \ picture after picture. And that momentum would have me approaching people and\
  \ situations that would have been mentally off-limits from even last week's level\
  \ of engagement. I didn't expect to find that the forced intimacy of getting caught\
  \ taking a candid portrait will probably always be uncomfortable. You just never\
  \ know how people will react and there's a fear of standing out, of doing something\
  \ WRONG. You know you're not only well within your rights but you're actively appreciating\
  \ the beauty of a person and their environment. But the creeper vibe is hard to\
  \ shake. \n\nSo perhaps you instead ask to take a portrait of them, either because\
  \ you're scared to shoot a candid or because their face is so uniquely beautiful.\
  \ And your social conditioning takes yet another hit because the majority of people\
  \ say yes. Be it candidly or actively, there's a very curious moment when you as\
  \ a stranger with a camera engage with your subject. They see you or your proposal\
  \ to shoot some portraits and there's a brief inner war between child-like joy and\
  \ suspicion. I can usually tell what their answer is going to be before they actually\
  \ speak. If the response is conditioned and \"normal,\" it's going to be a rejection.\
  \ \"Mmm...\" or \"Well...\" Is always followed by a \"no,\" whereas a period of\
  \ silence and flickering facial expressions has a pretty good chance of being a\
  \ \"yes.\" And I didn't expect that I'd find so much courage to keep asking, to\
  \ keep not asking, and to just really let myself look strangers in the eye and SEE\
  \ them from a place of beauty and wonder. When I look for beauty it completely transforms\
  \ how I approach life. So much falls away and for that I'm incredibly grateful for\
  \ having found this form of photography."
