Text: "Nothing had prepared me for this moment. I sat between two friends, tears pooling\
  \ in my eyes. There was a soft creaking as we ascended, legs dangling, to the top.\
  \ I\u2019d avoided it most the day, opting instead to be the camerawoman and capture\
  \ those unforgettable moments as my friends defied gravity and common sense. They\
  \ were seasoned thrill-seekers, relishing the chance to turn fear into pleasure.\
  \ Knowing this, I\u2019d agreed to go to Dreamworld, and experience my first theme\
  \ park. And in a moment of weakness, I had agreed to go on The Giant Drop. My friends\
  \ couldn\u2019t believe their luck, and before I could take it back, we were strapped\
  \ in and rising beyond escape. \n\nThe surrounding shrieks got fainter and I gripped\
  \ onto the silver handles, not daring to test the security of the leather harness\
  \ around me. \u201CWhat on Earth are you doing?!\u201D I asked myself. But due to\
  \ the fact that I was barely tethered to the planet by a 119 metre-high pole, perhaps\
  \ this question was a little inaccurate. \n\nSuddenly, we stopped. I made the mistake\
  \ of looking down almost instantly. \u201CTell my parents I love them,\u201D I gulped.\
  \ My friends assured me that I was going to be okay, and that it would be over almost\
  \ instantly. The serene view of traffic moving across the Pacific Highway did little\
  \ to calm my nerves, and nor did the birds coasting the breeze around the trees\
  \ below. Beside us, the Tower of Terror II rocketed off into the darkness, the strangers\u2019\
  \ screams sucked into the tunnel with them. We were alone, 39 stories in the air,\
  \ and the only way off was to fall down.\n\nThere was the sound of gears clunking,\
  \ and then we were falling. My hair flew upwards, and the wind rushed my face like\
  \ a pack of bulls. For the third time that day, my stomach seemed to stay suspended\
  \ in one place as I fell, and my face froze, petrified. As we swung to a halt, I\
  \ let out the shaky breath I didn\u2019t realise I\u2019d been holding, and wiped\
  \ my eyes.\n\nIf you\u2019d told me three days ago when we\u2019d arrived in Brisbane\
  \ that I\u2019d be going on The Giant Drop, let alone to an amusement park, I would\
  \ have laughed at your naivety. A home of rollercoasters is no place for a person\
  \ terrified of heights, falling and the foreboding of turbulence. Yet, as we dismounted\
  \ from the clutches of the ride, I felt invigorated. Perhaps there was some sense\
  \ to this adrenaline-junkie lifestyle after all. \n\n\u201CYou did it! So, what\
  \ did you think?\u201D \n\n\u201CYeah\u2026 Terrifying. But good. I feel like going\
  \ for a run!\u201D \n\nLaughing, we made our way towards our next ride. Though I\
  \ wasn\u2019t fully convinced on the merits of defying gravity, I certainly wasn\u2019\
  t going to relegate myself to the camerawoman anymore."
