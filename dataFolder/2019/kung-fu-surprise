Text: "While living in China, a friend and I wanted to learn some kung fu.  We approached\
  \ the local university kung fu professor and asked if he would teach us some basics.\
  \  He agreed and we spent Saturdays for six months learning the basics of a few\
  \ types of Kung Fu.  \nAt the end of the semester my friend Peter asked if I would\
  \ be gifting our teacher something to return the \u201Cguanxi\u201D or favor.  We\
  \ agreed we thought it was likely he would ask us to tutor his son and Peter preferred\
  \ to give a small gift.   I was curious and I waited to see what might be asked\
  \ of me.  \nThe next class, after Peter handed Master Wu his gift, Wu looked over\
  \ at my empty hands, put his arm around me and said: \u201Cit\u2019s been great\
  \ having you in our class.  Would you mind joining our exhibition next month?\u201D\
  \  I smiled and said sure.  Master Wu said: \u201Cgreat \u2013 we practice every\
  \ day from 3-7\u201D and then he walked away.\nI thought I heard wrong and he meant\
  \ once or twice a week.  Well, it turns out that practice was every day for 4 hours.\
  \  Master Wu addressed my fears and told me he had a really easy routine for me.\
  \  So I started to learn the simple but cool Ba Gua Zhang or 8 trigram palm boxing\
  \ routine.  \nWhile I was making progress on my simple moves, I noticed there was\
  \ a growing crowd of legitimate kung fu students.  These were Professor Wu\u2019\
  s best student and they were very good at Kung Fu.  \nOver the course of the next\
  \ few weeks, as legitimate kung fu students did flips while fighting with Swords\
  \ and spears, I continued to perfect my rudimentary 90 second routine.  Even though\
  \ I was intimidated by the skills of the students around me, I felt ok about my\
  \ routine.\nAt some point, Master Wu approached me and said I would need to make\
  \ my routine 5 minutes.  I told Master Wu that I only had 90 seconds of material\
  \ and he said that I could just do some \u201Cfiller\u201D moves.  At least that\
  \ is my interpretation.  He showed me these somewhat ridiculous filler moves and\
  \ said just keep repeating them until I hit about 2 minutes, then carry on with\
  \ my planned routine.  He said it should be good enough, as long as I really perfected\
  \ the basic or filler intro moves.\nI was seriously doubting my decision to not\
  \ give Wu a simple gift, but pressed on, knowing that whatever this exhibition was,\
  \ it would be a new experience for me.  Then the weekend of the exhibition came\
  \ and we walked to the neighboring University to exhibit our skills.  I was expecting\
  \ a classroom with chairs pushed aside; then doing my routine for Master Wu\u2019\
  s teacher friends.  To my utter horror, the venue was a large stadium with seating\
  \ for hundreds of spectators.  I asked my friend if he could translate the giant\
  \ red banner and he said: \u201CCentral China University Kung Fu Championships\u201D\
  . \nI gathered the small bit of courage I possessed and stepped onto the mat.  There\
  \ were six professional judges and hundreds of Kung Fu loving spectators waiting\
  \ for me.  I forgot half my filler moves.  Some friends had come to watch and one\
  \ of them let out a huge chuckle as I struggled to remember my routine.  I just\
  \ saw red, my ears buzzed and I think I finished my routine.  Only about 100 seconds\
  \ had passed, but it was a lifetime for me.\nThe next week, Master Wu had a party\
  \ and handed out trophies.  I was pleasantly surprised to get one myself.  I assumed\
  \ I either lost or was the only one in the \u201Cforeigner who is terrible at kung\
  \ fu\u201D category.  The trophy said I got 2nd place and I was both surprised and\
  \ confused.  My friend explained that they can\u2019t give you a first place trophy,\
  \ unless you are good."
