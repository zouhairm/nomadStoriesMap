Text: "Nairobi looked so beautiful from aerial view. The city was endowed with a magnificent\
  \ spectacle of bright lights. As someone who loves bright lights, the city had me\
  \ at hello. I could not wait to land to find out what the city had to offer. About\
  \ an hour later, I had arrived at the hotel. I took a quick shower and jumped straight\
  \ into bed.\nI woke up to my phone ringing the following day.\n\u201CHello! Welcome\
  \ to Nairobi. I cannot believe you are finally here! We have a whole day ahead of\
  \ us. I\u2019ll come pick you up in 2 hours, sounds good?\u201D Said Njeri.\n\u201C\
  Hi Njeri! I am so excited. I have been counting down for us to hang out in your\
  \ city. I will be ready in 2 hours. Can\u2019t wait! I said\n\u201CSee you then\u201D\
  \ Said Njeri as she hang up.\nQuick flash-back, Njeri and I met a year ago when\
  \ she came to visit her sister in Malawi. We were introduced to each other by a\
  \ mutual friend and kept in touch via phone ever since. She told me many stories\
  \ about her home country, Kenya, and I had longed to visit. So I started saving\
  \ up. I could hardly believe I was actually here. In 2 hours, I was ready to meet\
  \ Njeri. She arrived right on time. The first thing on our to-do list was the 7D\
  \ movie experience. We drove to Thika Road Mall, commonly known as TRM, and went\
  \ straight to the cinema. It seemed quite small. The lady on the ticket issuing\
  \ counter showed us the list of movies that were available to be viewed that day.\
  \ Njeri was so excited when she saw a movie called Forest Gump and suggested we\
  \ watch it. I agreed. Not long after, the lady who had issued us the tickets ushered\
  \ us into the cinema room. She said we had arrived on time and there was no need\
  \ to wait. Contrary to what I had thought, the room was quite big. It was dark and\
  \ there were a good number of people. I asked Njeri why my seat was unstable. She\
  \ said hers was too. Not long after this, the movie began playing. Next thing I\
  \ know, we were in a forest, the whole cinema room had images of trees on the walls.\
  \ Even the ceiling! The same kind of forest as the one on the screen. That was a\
  \ little scary. I looked up at the screen and the movie setting had changed from\
  \ the forest to a rail way that span across the forest. Then our chairs started\
  \ rocking.  I held on tightly to my seat and asked Njeri what was going on. She\
  \ burst out in laughter. That was when it clicked to me that we were being given\
  \ a real life movie experience, so we would feel what was going on in the movie.\
  \ Did I mention that the rail way had many turns? Yes, we rocked from left to right\
  \ on our seats. That was fun until crocodiles and other animals started popping\
  \ up on the screen. That was when the screaming began. Plus the unpredictable chair\
  \ rocking, things became scarier by the minute. Then funny. I think Njeri was a\
  \ little more scared than I was. So I mostly laughed at her. Just as we had gotten\
  \ used to moving through the forest and animals appearing from nowhere on the screen,\
  \ the room began to rain. I mean actual showers. I could not believe this. The funniest\
  \ part was watching Njeri cover her face to preserve what was left of her make up.\
  \ After a few minutes, the cinema room lights were turned on, the movie had ended.\
  \ \nWhen we has stepped out of the room, Njeri confessed that she had never had\
  \ a 7D movie experience before. It was the best 7 minutes ever. The anticipation,\
  \ the unpredictable nature of the movie made the whole experience worthwhile. I\
  \ still wish we were given a heads-up about the rain. Perhaps Njeri would have saved\
  \ her makeup. But then again, I would not be teasing her about it till now, so I\
  \ am glad."
