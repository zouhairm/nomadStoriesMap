Text: "\"Be alert. You might encounter a bear or a porcupine..\" What!!\n\nWhen my\
  \ friends informed me about a weekend trek to Shali Tibba, I was both nervous and\
  \ excited. My thoughts raced back to the time when a relative was showing me the\
  \ Shali tibba peak from our house in Mashobra. From where we were standing it already\
  \ looked like a daunting task to trek the highest peak in all of Shimla hills. Though\
  \ it made for a pretty sight in the cool evenings of Mashobra, it seemed it would\
  \ be a fairly tough climb to undertake. \n\nWe were fifteen young enthusiastic trekkers\
  \ who drove from Shimla in six 4*4 All Terrain Vehicles. The drive to Khatnol from\
  \ where the actual trek begins is a 48 km ramble through hill and dale from Shimla\
  \ and goes via Mashobra, Dhalli, Baldiyan and Sahol. The route from Mashobra is\
  \ an uphill as well as a downhill ride, into a valley and then out of it. It is\
  \ mostly forest but with well defined trails.\n\nAlthough I knew I wasn't in the\
  \ best shape to undertake this trek, what kept me motivated was the good company\
  \ and the satisfaction of seeing myself atop Shimla's highest peak, one that I had\
  \ so dreamily wished to climb on a cold winter evening. \n\nAs I started walking\
  \ uphill from Khatnol, I came across dense pine trees and thick pastures on both\
  \ sides of the road. The valley was so deep that I preferred to walk in silence\
  \ and enjoy the merry chirping of the himalayan birds. It was then that I was told\
  \ to be on guard in case I encountered a bear or a porcupine. \n\nA little into\
  \ the climb and I realised I had made a big mistake. Not only did I already want\
  \ to give up and turn back but I was actually contemplating on requesting a friend\
  \ to carry me. Fear of embarrassment lead me to silence the voices in my head and\
  \ continue on the trek. Fortunately for me the regular practice of meditation helped\
  \ me stay grounded and control my impulses. \n\nIt was my goal to reach that peak\
  \ and reach it in one piece, no matter what it took. After seeing everyone around\
  \ me trek up the mountain with the speed and tenacity of agile cats, I was determined\
  \ not to be the only one to stay back alone. But alas! I was alone.. walking all\
  \ by myself for the most part of the trek. The saying that goes: \"the journey to\
  \ the top of the mountain is a lonely one\" had become true for me. \n\nEventually\
  \ I did have well- meaning friends who offered to walk with me and encouraged me\
  \ to pick up pace. It was as though they were all taking turns to keep me company\
  \ and I really did appreciate it. \n\nBut as I persevered and continued to trek\
  \ I did eventually reach the blessed peak. It only took several many stops to recharge\
  \ my energies but I had to remind myself that I was in a different place physically\
  \ and so not to compare myself with others. Small reminders such as these helped\
  \ along the way. Fortunately I did have a much older friend for company who was\
  \ also taking it easy and so the going became both interesting and enjoyable.\n\n\
  Once we reached the peak everyone got busy in making arrangements for a comfortable\
  \ stop over for the night. Tents were pitched, food was being prepared and liquor\
  \ was out. By dusk, all was ready and everyone had settled to a bonfire with lip\
  \ smacking food and drinks. Music had come on and by midnight everyone was happy\
  \ and drunk.  \n\nIt was during this time that a group of local men from the surrounding\
  \ villages were trekking up. They saw that we had settled to a bonfire and decided\
  \ to give us company. What followed was endless drunken conversations, sharing of\
  \ hash cigarettes, formless dancing and re-connecting with friends and strangers\
  \ on a land we all loved so much- Himachal Pradesh, the abode of the Gods. I had\
  \ never imagined that a simple trek would turn into one big dance party."
