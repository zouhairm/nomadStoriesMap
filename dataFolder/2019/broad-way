Text: "My hands lost grip of the wheel as I switched lanes, well at least this happened\
  \ in my brain. As the miles became more brief my heart was slipping into uncertainty.\
  \ I mean just yesterday I knew this was the best choice, but at this moment only\
  \ time would tell. Selma, Alabama, disguised more as my hometown. I thought I made\
  \ a you turn for a moment. The more I embarked towards my destiny the setting became\
  \ more unfamiliar. I thought I ran over a piece of a tree, but it was a piece of\
  \ the store. I know this may sound dramatic but this place was that run down. My\
  \ friend and I stared at each other in agreement, as if my thoughts slipped in his\
  \ mind, or his slipped in mines. Not much had changed In that city since Martin\
  \ Luther King. You know that feeling when you know you\u2019re headed to grandmas?\
  \ I\u2019m being naive as I say this because I understand everyone probably wouldn\u2019\
  t have had the same experience. That feeling of calmness, you just know not much\
  \ is up but whatever that Experince had in store, well yes! It was one of those.\
  \ On the flip side some of the scenery such as this ancient looking mall was worth\
  \ the captures of the camera. The watches of the night was reeling me in as the\
  \ sun hadn\u2019t set yet. Finally my friend and I arrived at our destination only\
  \ to find out we were in the boonies. All assumptions aside we actually enjoyed\
  \ our company. We felt as if we were at home. The people we met had the same accent\
  \ as we did, oh man we shared some laughs the minute we step in the building. The\
  \ dorms we stayed in looked like prison cells. We stayed out in this land for about\
  \ 4 or 5 months. Around every corner, upon every highway we shared those moments\
  \ of uncertainty, but having our maker on our side, we didn\u2019t have much room\
  \ for fear in our hearts. We traveled up and down the state of Alabama. One city\
  \ couldn\u2019t hold us. The late night stops at Krystal burgers, that was the go\
  \ to for a late night snack, having a comedian show passing through the drive thru.\
  \ Let me not forget the adventure we had over in Auburn, Alabama. I felt like a\
  \ baby bear venturing out on his own for the first time, climbing massive hills\
  \ to get to the store, skipping through traffic at a red light to get to the other\
  \ side of the road. This was only 1 of 1 time. The other time my car called a personal\
  \ timeout as we were heading to Montegomery one evening. It costed us at least nearly\
  \ half a day to fix her up to get to our destination. Coming into that experience\
  \ in Alabama was mad! It was fun while it lasted but there came sorrow with it and\
  \ that\u2019s all for another story, from city to city, this travel earned the title\
  \ of broad way, uncertain but endless possibilities when it existed."
