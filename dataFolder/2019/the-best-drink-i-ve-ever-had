Text: "Africa has always fascinated me but seemed so far out of reach for my personal\
  \ travels, that I\u2019d virtually written it off as somewhere I\u2019d visit in\
  \ my early twenties - until I landed a job at a travel company on team Discovery\
  \ Channel (aka Africa). I jumped at the first opportunity to get my feet on this\
  \ immense continent. 7 months later I was standing alone at the airport check-in\
  \ mumbling, \u201CI\u2019m here for the direct flight to Nairobi\u201D, about to\
  \ board a dreamliner to Africa to meet 7 strangers that I\u2019d be spending the\
  \ next 10 days with on a safari tour around Kenya.\n\nI departed the Nairobi airport\
  \ with my unfamiliar travel companions, and within 30 minutes we were in an open-topped\
  \ vehicle snapping photos of giraffes in Nairobi National Park. The experience was\
  \ already above what I\u2019d expected, and I had a feeling it would continuously\
  \ amaze me. \n\nSafari is all about early mornings, so come 6:30am, we were boarding\
  \ our first regional flight to Amboseli. The area is known for its breathtaking\
  \ views of Mount Kilimanjaro and extraordinary elephant herds, and if you\u2019\
  re lucky you can capture both together for the million-dollar photo. We were looking\
  \ over this exact scene at sunset, when I declared, \u201Cthis is the coolest place\
  \ I\u2019ve ever had a drink\u201D.\n\nWhat came the next morning is honestly the\
  \ only part of the trip that I should have predicted: I got sick. Picture taking\
  \ a 45 minute bumpy drive to the airstrip (which is essentially a dirt road), then\
  \ hopping on a 12 seater plane for two consecutive hour-long flights, then finally\
  \ a 90 minute drive through the hills of Laikipia to a remote lodge. Now picture\
  \ doing all that with the most aggressive upset stomach and the inability to keep\
  \ down any medicine. And yet as we arrived at our beautiful lodge built into the\
  \ rockface over the cascading river, I was determined not to miss any of the activities.\
  \ So, after a quick nap and an outdoor shower, I rejoined the group for our sundowner\
  \ drive. After an incredible sighting of two bull elephants in a territorial face-off,\
  \ we perched ourselves on the mountain and were gazing in awe at the rolling desert\
  \ landscape, when I started to announce \u201Cokay, this is the coolest place I\u2019\
  ve ever had a\u2026..\u201D and suddenly I was sick all over again. It will be impossible\
  \ to forget being sick in the Kenyan bush as the sky was getting darker, with my\
  \ guide saying enthusiastically, \u201Cyes! I hear the hyenas coming!\u201D\n\n\
  Although Laikipia was beautiful, I was happy to move on to our next destination.\
  \ Kitich camp is positioned deep in the Matthews forest with their closest neighbouring\
  \ camp a 3-hour drive away. We spent our days trekking through the trees and mountains\
  \ and swimming in magical freshwater pools. At the end of our second day, we drove\
  \ to a lookout where the mountains part and you can see Somalia on the horizon.\
  \ Changing my mind again, I just about shouted \u201Cthis is the coolest place I\u2019\
  ve had a drink!\u2019\n\nOur final stop was the vast plains of the Mara \u2013 one\
  \ of the most famous landscapes in Africa and where Simba calls home. The tented\
  \ camps are unfenced, and it was common to hear buffalos scraping up against your\
  \ canvas walls so close that you could hear the water sloshing in his stomach or\
  \ wake up to lion prints outside your tent. In our incredible time here we saw lions,\
  \ leopards, and cheetahs. On our final night, we slowed our vehicle in the middle\
  \ of the national park for our last dawa while we watched the sun go down behind\
  \ a lone acacia tree. As if on cue I said, \u201Cthis time I\u2019m sure, it\u2019\
  s the coolest place I\u2019ve had a drink\u201D\n\nWorking for a trip planning company,\
  \ you might wonder if I had known what to expect on this trip, but the magic of\
  \ safari is in the parts that you can\u2019t describe, photograph, or predict. We\
  \ crossed diverse landscapes with countless breathtaking views, but now I think\
  \ I can safely say, Kenya is the coolest place I\u2019ve ever had a drink."
