  D\u2009(G(z)))]\u201D is an elegant enigma. Not in the same sense as Einstein\u2019\
  s E=mc^2 by conflating the three basic components of our universe into just two.\
  \ Nevertheless, the art universe was shaken. The artwork created by the above algorithm\
  \ is ironic given three friends with no artistic experience found themselves richer\
  \ by $30.5 million rupees for its sale at Christies when the auction house bid art\
  \ created by artificial intelligence for the first time. The irony comes in the\
  \ form of this French artist collective\u2019s name: Obvious. \n\nAnd I say rupees\
  \ deliberately. \n\nWhile in Bengaluru on a dubious offshore excursion, I stumbled\
  \ upon the \u2018Gradient Descent\u2019 exhibition, held at the Nature Morte gallery\
  \ in New Delhi where the first AI art exhibition in India was opened. We eventually\
  \ ventured to a quaint cul de sac from one of the main artillery highway roads in\
  \ Bengaluru, and hidden behind a queasy but easily Google-able salon. I noticed\
  \ malapropos fecal matter on the pavement, possibly from a retired roaming, sacred\
  \ cow and the friendly but discerning stares from the local neighbours as we found\
  \ our bearings. Bengaluru has the character of a sleepy old town which has been\
  \ reluctantly churned into a bustling, dizzy start-up-obsessed metropolitan hub.\
  \ Streets like this reminded one of what it once was: the 'Garden City of India'.\n\
  \n64/1 I\u2019ve learnt is the address of an AI artist curator, Karthik Kalyanarama\
  \ but also the name of his research collective with his artist brother, Raghava\
  \ KK. They were the brains behind the exhibition, drawing international artists\
  \ into this burgeoning AI-Art field.\n\nOn welcoming us to his dida\u2019s home,\
  \ I was less than prepared for this impromptu visit. We were greeted by a formal\
  \ seating area, with a carved looming wooden swing-seat, cold marble-tiled floors\
  \ which I could feel as we had taken off our shoes, and the distinct smell of antique\
  \ brass. Karthik revealed the cognitive dissonance of his grandmother \u2013 she\
  \ was an antiques dealer but kept the most prized artefacts to herself. And yet,\
  \ there were kitschy plastic ornaments which adorned the place which added a neon-pop\
  \ of colour against the haze of gold, copper, and grand mythical depictions. I asked\
  \ why the paintings in Mysuru Palace and those hanging on the wall above all depicted\
  \ the people in an \u201Cinfantile\u201D way. He remarked that India\u2019s traditional\
  \ art did not go through the same humanist and classical development that western\
  \ art had \u2013 there was no need to create anatomically correct figures (well,\
  \ as no one usually has more than 10 arms and legs so this point was clear to me)\
  \ and therefore portrayed a multiple of scenes. I remember the turquoise sea of\
  \ marble tiles in contrast to the charcoal soles of my feet. The polyamorous culture\
  \ with a plethora of ethnicities, religions and norms, that art depicts society\
  \ was a truth I felt here. From the corner of my eye, I spotted sombrely an elephant\u2019\
  s foot ornament.\n\nKarthik invited us to continue our discussion over lunch, prepared\
  \ by a cook beforehand of a Masala Dosa with sambar and mint Chutney. I noticed\
  \ there wasn\u2019t any of the Idli and hustle I was now accustomed to. Time was\
  \ a luxury in Karthik's household. \n\nThe title of the exhibit is fitting considering\
  \ Gradient Descent is the most used learning algorithm in Machine Learning: a simple\
  \ optimization procedure which finds the deepest valley in multiple functions. \n\
  \nOnly days before we had cycled our way through a rural village in Seringapatam\
  \ Island. We meandered past rainbow sari drying down concrete steps where men bathed,\
  \ women washed and children swam against the gentle current of the river, a shade\
  \ of jade. There was only a slight valley in our journey: cycling through deep potholes\
  \ along the sugar cane fields.\n\n64/1 believes artists need to be more engaged\
  \ with the future, a large part of which is going to be determined by AI. \u201C\
  Technology in some form or other mediates all our relationships with the natural\
  \ world,\u201D Karthik commented. Through my own passage to India, I sensed this\
  \ could help us reimagine the new possibilities of our complex, cyborg age."
