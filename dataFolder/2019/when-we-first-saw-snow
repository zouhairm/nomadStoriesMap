Text: "2016 is one of the most beautiful years of my life. Because I've visited one\
  \ of the most beautiful places in the world. This country is not too far from my\
  \ country of origin, Indonesia. But the conditions are very different. From the\
  \ climate, weather, temperature, and nature. \n\nThis country is New Zealand.\n\n\
  The main purpose of the trip to New Zealand is to attend a geothermal conference\
  \ at Auckland University. But to be honest, that's not what we're looking for. But\
  \ to see snow in the mountains for the first time in life. Because as humans who\
  \ live in tropical regions, it is almost impossible to see and feel the presence\
  \ of snow. So after carrying out a scientific presentation at a conference in Auckland,\
  \ my friend and I immediately arranged a trip to the mountains on the South Island\
  \ of New Zealand. We don't want to miss this opportunity. \n\nThe next day, we flew\
  \ from Auckland to Christchurch. We know that the best way to travel in New Zealand\
  \ is to rent a car or camper van. So immediately we searched for a car rental after\
  \ leaving the airport. At the car rental site, we were surprised to see the requirement\
  \ to borrow a car is to have a credit card. And we don't have one. You know, we\
  \ are only poor students from developing countries who cannot afford to have a credit\
  \ card. The clerk gave us a solution that we could borrow someone else's credit\
  \ card as collateral, by making a statement.\n\nLuckily, the brother of one of our\
  \ friends who was in Indonesia was willing to lend his credit card as a guarantee\
  \ and at the same time made a statement. Finally we could fulfill the requirements\
  \ and we managed to borrow a car, even though it was only a small sedan.\n\nIt was\
  \ late, but summer made the afternoon longer. But we must keep hurrying. We see\
  \ maps and internet references. The South Island of New Zealand has many places\
  \ to see. We remain focused on the main goal of seeing snowy mountains. So we decided\
  \ the first destination was the highest mountain on this land, Aoraki Mountain.\n\
  \nThat same evening we rushed to drive our sedan to Aoraki Mointain. The journey\
  \ takes approximately 4 hours. It's dark already. We stopped at a small church parking\
  \ lot. We don't know where exactly. Visitors were quite crowded that night. They\
  \ stopped to take photos of the church and the bright starry sky. We also fell asleep\
  \ there until the morning. When the day is clear, we realize we are on the edge\
  \ of Lake Tekapo. And that church is the Church of the Good Shepherd, a very famous\
  \ old church.\n\nFrom a distance, it appears on the horizon of a row of snowy mountains.\
  \ Me and my friends immediately continued the journey to approach the mountain.\
  \ Then we passed Lake Pukaki, which was clean blue with a view of Mount Aoraki that\
  \ was getting closer. We speed up the pace of our car along the most beautiful side\
  \ of the lake I have ever seen in my life.\n\nSoon, we arrived at the Valey Hooker.\
  \ As a geologist, I was struck by the rocks that lay in these mountains. At first\
  \ glance, I learned that these rocks are evidence of tectonic movements on the continent\
  \ of New Zealand. Truly extraordinary.\n\nWe also walked across the valley produced\
  \ by glacier. Our eyes are always facing up, looking at the top of the mountains\
  \ covered in white snow. Some reflect the afternoon sun so it's very glare. We arrived\
  \ at Lake Hooker then sat by his side. Gawking in amazement. A view that we will\
  \ never forget.\n\nOh Yes, this is the most beautiful day of my life. \nThe day\
  \ when we first saw snow."
