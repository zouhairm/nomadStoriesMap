Text: "\"What ... !! ... camping out on Pulau Banyak ... ???, where is it ... ??,\
  \ you have been there before ... ???, are you out of your mind ... ???\u201D. A\
  \ few questions and responses as I invited some friends on an adventure,  Its normal.\
  \  As horrific events of earthquak and Tsunami disaster have just hit several areas\
  \ of our country. Lombok, Palu, Donggala and the Sunda strait are several areas\
  \ where the disaster has just struck, all in the coastal area. And, of course, due\
  \ to the severe aftereffects of the Tsunami which struck Sumatra island specificcally\
  \ the city of banda Aceh 13 years ago on December 26, 2006. Coincide it is also\
  \ we planned an adventure to Pulau banyak of 2018. \"Pulau Banyak is in Aceh Singkil,\
  \ never\", I answered briefly. Finally, it was just me and one of my friends 'Sura'\
  \ left.\nAfter a grueling trip of nearly 10 hours, 5 hours by motorbike and then\
  \ crossing by traditional boat from the port of Singkil we arrived on an amazing\
  \ island. Yup, the name of the island is Rangik Kecil Island. An island of exotic\
  \ beauty, with a land area of approximately five acres (5 ha), almost the entire\
  \ island is covered with palm trees and is deliberately planted as garden by the\
  \ local people, uninhabited, without electricity and fresh water facilities, there\
  \ is a lighthouse building about 30 meters high , clear sea like glass with amazing\
  \ coral, sloping beach and safe enough to snorkel, sorrounded by a vast  ocean,\
  \ which appears only a few nearby islands which are quite easy to access using speed\
  \ boats, traditional boats (can be rented and guided by local residents at a fairly\
  \ cheap cost, with a capacity of 8 people per 1 boat per 1 day only around Rp.800,000-Rp.1,500,000\
  \ depending on negotiations, usually the price depends on the distance and how many\
  \ islands we will visit) and kayaking (only if we bring it ourselves, because there\
  \ is not available yet).\nAt first we didn\u2019t know where to camp, but the friendliness\
  \ of the local people we met as soon as we arrived at the Balai island suggested\
  \ that we go to the Rangik Kecil island. After negotiating with the owner of a traditional\
  \ boat, luckily we were able to get a price of Rp. 500,000 for one transfer and\
  \ shuttle. Spending almost 4 days and 3 nights on this island is indeed quite an\
  \ extraordinary experience. Uniting with the universe teaches us about the meaning\
  \ of a struggle, the struggle for survival with minimal facilities, teaches us about\
  \ using things to the fullest and teaches us about planning a journey carefully.\
  \ These valuable experiences will only belong to those who are never afraid to take\
  \ risks. And, of course, satisfaction around enjoying the beauty of the island,\
  \ sunbathing  on soft sandy beaches and swimming all day, snorkelling, fishing,\
  \ enjoying sunrise and sunset, turning on the campfire at night while staring at\
  \ the stars, not necessarily getting an atmosphere like this once in a lifetime.\n\
  Pulau banyak is a cluster of tiny islands located in the Aceh Singkil district,\
  \ Aceh province which is directly adjacent to the Indian Ocean, precisely at the\
  \ western end of Sumatra Island, which is 26 nautical miles off Singkil, and can\
  \ only be reached by motor boat, from Singkil (3-5 hours), Sibolga (9-12 hours),\
  \ Nias (6-8 hours), Teluk Jamin (6-8 hours). Before the Tsunami there were 99 islands\
  \ in the archipelago, but currently only 63 are large and small islands. with a\
  \ majority Muslim population and certainly very friendly to local and foreign visitors.\
  \ Tourist destinations in this island are quite numerous, with a variety of different\
  \ characteristics from each island. there are many islands that are highly recommended\
  \ to visit in these islands; Pulau Balai (an island inhabited by native locals and\
  \ a transit island to other islands), Tailana Island, Small Rangik Island, Palambak\
  \ Island, Long Island, Biawak Island, Asok Island, Lambudung Island, Tapus-tapus\
  \ Island, Island Sikandang, Bangkaru Island, Tuangku Island and others. and it is\
  \ not enough for a month to explore the entire island in this archipelago, only\
  \ those hungry for adventure will be interested in conquering these islands. are\
  \ you one of them ... ???, let me know ..!??\nMukhlish Sidebang, March 2019"
