Text: "I found myself silently, but uncontrollably, crying into my breakfast at a\
  \ little caf\xE9 in Greymouth. Luckily, I was facing the window with my back to\
  \ the rest of the caf\xE9, so I figured my episode would go unnoticed. I was wrong.\
  \ After about 5 minutes a sweet older Kiwi woman laid her hand on my shoulder and\
  \ asked if I was all right. I looked up at her with tears streaming down my face\
  \ and gurgled that I was fine, and thanked her for asking. After all, I did not\
  \ know exactly why I was crying. There had been no bad news, no homesickness, no\
  \ pain or illness \u2013 mental or otherwise. In fact, I am normally quite capable\
  \ of controlling myself, and my tears. But these days nothing is \u2018normal\u2019\
  , is it. Neither for me nor, I suppose, for the world. \n\nTen minutes later when\
  \ I finally finished my breakfast and had composed myself, I stood to leave and\
  \ went to thank the woman for her kindness. She and her partner were in a booth\
  \ waiting for their breakfast to arrive. They turned towards me and she opened her\
  \ arms to give me a hug, during which I immediately started crying again. It felt\
  \ so good to have a big hug like that. I\u2019d been traveling for just over a month\
  \ by then, and though I met loads of nice people, I hadn\u2019t had any physical\
  \ contact. As someone who expresses love through touch, I was missing my daily quota\
  \ of hugs, which are readily available back home. \u201CI really am okay! There\
  \ is nothing wrong with me \u2013 I just can\u2019t stop crying,\u201D I managed\
  \ to get out between sobs. \n\nMy best explanation for what was happening was that\
  \ I was experiencing a big release old \u2018stuff\u2019: old thoughts, blocks,\
  \ patterns, emotions, etc. I told them as much. \u201CAh\u201D said the woman knowingly,\
  \ \u201CMelting ice.\u201D I nodded. They both looked at me with compassion. \u201C\
  It\u2019s about the journey, dear, remember that. Not the destination\u201D said\
  \ the woman. With that, she gave me another big hug. I said thank you to them again\
  \ between gasps and walked out of the caf\xE9.\n\nI am not a stranger to releasing\
  \ the old to make room for the new. This is actually what I help other people to\
  \ do in my line of work, and though there are heaps of ways to release, tears are\
  \ one of the most cathartic. I cried for around 5 more hours that day, all the way\
  \ to Franz Josef, and intermittently into the night. \n\nThe next 24 hours were\
  \ of the most unexpected and exhilarating of my life. That morning I had plans to\
  \ go heli-hiking - taking a helicopter up to the Franz Josef glacier and hiking\
  \ in the dazzling ice crevasses. It was expensive, but given the current state of\
  \ the planet, I figured I might live to see a time when this activity is no longer\
  \ available. \n\nOn the glacier, amidst feeling super high on life and receiving\
  \ epiphanies from the Universe, I heard our guide mention that tonight they were\
  \ starting a brand new overnight tour for folks to ice-climb, stargaze and sleep\
  \ on the glacier with dinner and breakfast included. They had been trying for years\
  \ to get the permissions to do this, and that day was the first ever day they would\
  \ do the tour \u2013 if they could get enough people.\n\nA few days before, I would\
  \ not have done it. Now, empty of tears and blocks, I felt so clear. I was in the\
  \ right place at the right time. I felt immense energy to do this overnight. In\
  \ the end, I and five other women became the first non-guide group to experience\
  \ the glacier in this way. I never expected to find that my own internal releasing\
  \ mirrored my surroundings so profoundly in this place of constant external release.\
  \ After a late night of indescribably beautiful stargazing, I fell asleep smiling\
  \ at the space my own melting ice had made for an opportunity like this to appear\
  \ for me. Waking only occasionally to the sound of large pieces of melting ice crashing\
  \ noisily down the glacial wall."
