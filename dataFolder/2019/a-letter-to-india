Text: "Dearest India,\nI remember saying to my sister before meeting you I thought\
  \ I was dying. As if I was creating space for something new to emerge. A little\
  \ melodramatic. But you know me so well now.\nI\u2019ve never met anyone like you.\
  \ I\u2019d heard so much about you, so I thought I knew you. How silly of me. \n\
  People had warned me of you. Told me you were dangerous, and I needed to be careful\
  \ of you. I don\u2019t like being told what to do or think, so I ignored them.\n\
  Remember when we first met? March the 17th, 2017.\nI was very vulnerable and scared.\
  \ I was out of my comfort zone and you didn\u2019t help. Within the first week you\
  \ took my phone, my money and shoe. Yes, one shoe. You smiled kindly, and said it\
  \ was my first lesson.\nI was angry and annoyed. How could you be so cruel? \nYet\
  \ I trusted you. You didn\u2019t expect anything and came without conditions. You\
  \ welcomed everyone as your friend, without judgment. You showed me how to pause\
  \ and enjoy the moment. Such as watching the cows wandering on the beach, listening\
  \ to the drums playing as the sunset kissed the blue ripples of the sea. \nYou introduced\
  \ me to ecstatic dance. A way to express myself without alcohol or the fear of what\
  \ anyone was thinking. With sweat dripping from every pore of my body, under a magnificent\
  \ Banyan tree, I finally reached my bliss.\nYou introduced me to new food. Bhelpuri!\
  \ I still dream of the delicious puffed rice vegetables dish with the spicy tamarind\
  \ sauce.\nYou introduced me to new ways of viewing life. The absence of my phone\
  \ and money showed me how much of the world I was ignoring and how generous people\
  \ can be.\nYou introduced me to parts of myself I had been hiding from.\nFor the\
  \ next 6 months you showed me all of you. It was hard to see all the sadness and\
  \ hardship sometimes. It was overwhelming.\nEventually, with patience and time,\
  \ I realised there is a tranquillity in your chaos. Beauty is your ugliness and\
  \ light in your shadow.\nI wanted to tell you as I may never see you again, that\
  \ you changed me profoundly. Deep within every cell in my body. \nIt wasn\u2019\
  t always easy, and I have difficulty explaining to others the real essence of who\
  \ you are. \nI do want to tell people about you, but not too much. That is where\
  \ your magic lies, your unknown.\nThank you for everything.\nYou are a gift, a great\
  \ teacher and a beloved friend.\nMuch love as always,\nCarly"
