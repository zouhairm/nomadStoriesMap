Text: "In-between each pull on her cigarette, the production editor puffed out tiny\
  \ clouds.  She hurried the cigarette as she paced through the alley, to lose the\
  \ stream of people wandering through Neal\u2019s Yard into the central hexagonal\
  \ seating area.  She looked distracted and unamused.  \n\nI've come to Neal\u2019\
  s Yard on the eve of the Brexit vote, for its distinctively European feel - with\
  \ eyes closed there are very few local voices, more Spanish, Italian, Arabic and\
  \ more.  The open slated windows remind me of a narrow Italian alley, turquoise\
  \ painted frames and olive-green flower crawlers on the terracotta walls have the\
  \ colour of Barcelona.  The thin spindled Seville orange trees transport me back\
  \ to Andaluc\xEDa.    \u201CLong gone are the Camden-esque alternative roots of\
  \ the area\" said the designer who had been working there for 8 years.  \u201CIt's\
  \ more boutiquey-now.\"  The colours, smell of roasted pistachios, watermelon shisha,\
  \ Neapolitan pizza, echo central Cannes and other cosmopolitan cities where all\
  \ things European collide.\n\nStepping outside Neal\u2019s Yard, the Monmouth street\
  \ air feels different as one leaves the cul-de-sac of cool and traditional.  I note\
  \ the 'Dumping is prohibited sign\u2019, jolting me from my European excursion,\
  \ back to the UK."
