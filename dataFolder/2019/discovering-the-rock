Text: "Travelling has been commonly known as a beautiful form of escapism. My reality\
  \ being chaotic, I was so desperate for a break that I decided to hop onto a train\
  \ to Mangalore all by myself right after attending my convocation ceremony. Travelling\
  \ alone for 18 hours by train didn't seem to rattle me until it actually sunk in\
  \ when the train started to move. But all I could do then was gaze out the window\
  \ and wonder if this decision was actually going to get me the little sense of calm\
  \ that I had been craving for. \n\nLooking back at that train journey, I remember\
  \ the details- the faces of the people in my compartment, the stations they got\
  \ in and got off at, the food they ate, the beverage sellers, the ticket collector.\
  \ I was so focused on everything around me, I didn't let my mind be at ease even\
  \ for a minute throughout the journey. I didn't listen to music, I didn't read.\
  \ I only observed. Until I realized that this is exactly why I had decided to leave\
  \ Mumbai. I didn't want to observe other people and preoccupy my mind, I had been\
  \ doing that for months now and I was truly drained out. However, by the time I\
  \ inferred this I had reached my destination and it was time to alight from the\
  \ train. \n\nI was living with my grandmother in Mangalore, at a bungalow that is\
  \ about 10 minutes away from the beach. The beach was my calling. The idea of being\
  \ by the ocean, amidst the rocks, sitting on the sand was what I had held onto while\
  \ making a decision about this trip. I was only looking for getting about two minutes\
  \ of tranquillity that the waves bring to you.\n\nThe Someshwar beach would come\
  \ quite close to being my home. Hence, when I reached there, the change hit me too\
  \ hard. The locals shared how they had been experiencing high tides for a duration\
  \ of over 8 months now. Due to this, the shore had reduced and a few rocks where\
  \ people could sit on top of were submerged under the water. Instead of a broad\
  \ seaside, what was left now was a thin and narrow strip of sand spread across.\
  \ While the change was disheartening, the comfort of just being there was very fulfilling\
  \ to the soul. \n\nI decided to trek onto the highest accessible cliff against the\
  \ sea, found a place right at the central front edge of it and parked myself there.\
  \ From where I was seated, I could let the vastness of the ocean consume me. The\
  \ sun was bright and spreading its shine on the waves of the ocean that made the\
  \ entire scene look like nothing less than a beautiful painting. Everything seemed\
  \ so much bigger than the constant ridiculous chatter in my head. \n\nWhile I was\
  \ lost in the ocean's serenity, a rock at a distance caught my attention. It was\
  \ being submerged constantly by the crashing waves. I focused on each wave, each\
  \ direction it hit that rock in and I didn't realize when I finally started conversing\
  \ with myself.  It was that rock that helped me look within and reflect. \n\nIt\
  \ was after 20 years of my life that I had discovered a rock that was hidden beneath\
  \ the boundless ocean that was me, surfacing only a little when the waves stopped\
  \ hitting it. It was here when I realized that there is a giant rock that was waiting\
  \ to be discovered. There will be waves coming at that rock from all directions\
  \ to hide it. But I realized that no matter how high the tide is, I had to swim\
  \ my way through it and find out what does the rock hold beneath the tiny tip seen\
  \ from atop the cliff. \n\nThe gradual decrease in the sun's bright rays brought\
  \ my attention to the time.  As I got up to get back home, I didn't leave the beach\
  \ with just the calmness I was looking for but with something bigger- the courage\
  \ of taking a dive into the ocean and going right at the bottom of it to discover\
  \ my entire rock."
