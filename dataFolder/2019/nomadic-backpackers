Text: "Life is an amazing journey with lots of eventful phases. So I believe in making\
  \ each and every event a happy one by fulfilling my dreams and aspirations. That\
  \ is through, exploring new cities, discovering new places, gaining knowledge regarding\
  \ their culture and moulding some or the other into my own life. The spirit that\
  \ thrive deep inside me renders me the opportunity to go ahead  and defy destiny\
  \ in my own way and \nit motivates me to travel all around the globe.\nI'm a born\
  \ princess so I was named Sarika, A complete extrovert with sarcastic nature, free\
  \ spirit, bibliophile, wanderlust soul.\nI'm a published author and a blogger too.\
  \ I love travelling and exploring new cities, meeting new people, communicating\
  \ with them, knowing about their culture their lifestyle everything. The new world\
  \ what I see everytime fascinates me more to travel each and everytime. Not only\
  \ that the more you travel the more humans you get to know the more you understand\
  \ what's going in this world. Not happy stories all the time sometimes it's sad\
  \ too. I find soo many people going through numerous hurdles and sufferings in life\
  \ which teach me that we've got a better life to live and not just curse it all\
  \ the time. But the happiness they have and the way they treat show us the humanity\
  \ and concern of those hardworking people. Same way travelling as always been as\
  \ my passion and I always dreamt of getting a job where I could just travel on and\
  \ on so if at all I get this opportunity I would be damn Lucky and I would really\
  \ do the best and also explore the country through my sheer imagination.\nMore than\
  \ all this I love to travel because I'm very curious to know about the lifestyle\
  \ of people in different countries and also implement free really great technologies\
  \ in my country to help people in every possible way I can not only my country each\
  \ and every country where people are literally having a difficult time."
