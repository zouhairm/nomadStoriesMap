Text: "We all think the most of ourselves, able to withstand any situation. But when\
  \ it comes to booking flights, I often wish I had a more realistic vision. Yet,\
  \ here I am, exhausted but excited. After opting for the cheaper flight I found\
  \ myself in a new country without much of a plan. You know that flight, the cheap\
  \ one that ends up being hours longer than the others with terrible take off and\
  \ landing times. Here's where the lack of planning starts to kick my ass. Near 3:00\
  \ AM and I've landed. I should be sleeping, but now it's time for me to take on\
  \ the city of Delhi and the country of India. While I was able to withstand the\
  \ gruelling flights and layovers it was just the beginning of my day.\n\nI set out\
  \ of the airport and into the unknown. Language, geography, climate, everything\
  \ different, even in the shade of night. I managed to find myself a tuk-tuk to take\
  \ me into town. Where exactly? I don't know, but the centre of the city figures\
  \ to be the best spot to figure out my day. Although my destination for the day\
  \ was out of the city and north some hours, I needed to figure out my new environment\
  \ and how to adapt. After some hours of haggling, after being dragged to different\
  \ places after many miscommunications I made it near city centre where's trains\
  \ and taxis were abundant. The process was similar to that of any foreign country\
  \ and experience and I was beginning to find my footing. \n\nI found myself in a\
  \ cab and heading to a smaller town that I heard much about. I had it mind as one\
  \ of my must do destinations. I sit in this cab, hot and still trying to comprehend\
  \ what I was doing. My life had brought me across the world. It felt almost normal\
  \ now that I was in a vehicle, sheltered in from everything. Hot and sweaty in the\
  \ back of a cab that would take five hours to reach my destination. After I get\
  \ dropped off at what I think my destination is, I began walking, quickly finding\
  \ myself lost. A man offers to show me the way, which ultimately is not the right\
  \ way. The interaction and kindness of this Indian native brought me peace and comfort.\
  \ Those feelings faded after I had found myself lost and alone again.\n\nThe overwhelm\
  \ begins. I don't know where I am. I don't know anybody. I'm trying to find a specific\
  \ place to stay and cannot. What am I doing? It's hot, I can hardly communicate\
  \ with anybody and I haven't slept in many hours. My emotions began to feel overbearing.\
  \ But I had a moment where I was nearly about to break. Tears welling and I stopped\
  \ to laugh. This is it. THIS, everything I was experiencing was exactly what I had\
  \ wanted. It's what I asked for. All of the unknowns and uncomfortable feelings\
  \ are what I wanted to experience. I knew that from this, I would grow."
