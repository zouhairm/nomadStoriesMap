Text: "I\u2019ve been travelling around Europe for the last few months . And I\u2019\
  ve found nothing but inspiration for my self and for other people . I believe you\
  \ find love and excitement in the smallest details and most random moments. A trip\
  \ around Europe last year helped me recover from an abusive relationship which I\u2019\
  ve openly spoken about on my social media. Now I visit cities and have started writing\
  \ about the taste of the unknown and being brave - not to just talk about what I\
  \ saw and what\u2019s there for others but what I felt and I\u2019ve found this\
  \ to really resonate with other people. I like to see where my feet take me and\
  \ then talk honestly with compassion to others about the flavours and smells of\
  \ places I\u2019ve been. I\u2019ve seen that it\u2019s already inspired people to\
  \ go further than they normally would and to be brave. I wish to inspire which showing\
  \ the achievable . My travel blogs aren\u2019t about the flashy cars or most expensive\
  \ food - it\u2019s about how anyone can travel and achieve the dream of seeing the\
  \ world - in search of things that really match with your individual energy. The\
  \ people and the way they are and how they experiences , out of your comfort zone\
  \ , can affect and shape you , and your opinions on the world. I\u2019d love the\
  \ opportunity to travel more and write about it and for my voice to be a comfort\
  \ , a laugh , and an inspiration to others :) . My current blog is at www.bebravedarling.com\
  \ - I\u2019m alone in the world we all are and I\u2019ve strived through adversity\
  \ - anyone can too. It\u2019s a new venture but I hope you enjoy the read !! My\
  \ insta is @betsykitten_cekcsnaps - or search ; The Book Of ChaCha - enjoy !! :)"
