Text: "The Romantic Pharaonic Guy\n\nIn the depth of night, In the middle of River\
  \ Nile, going to The Nubian Village in Aswan, \u200Ethe captain stopped the boat,\
  \ and started to shake it to right and left in an exciting way.\u200E\nWe're already\
  \ excited being chosen for a journey to South Egypt by Alexandria Library for \u200E\
  being creative writers, but shaking like that in the middle of nowhere, we wished\
  \ if we were \u200Edull-minded and believed the journey would be the last.\u200E\
  \nWe knew it was a punishment to force the boys to step down the roof and stop dancing,\
  \ \u200Eassuring that if they wanted to dance, the boat would share the dance.\u200E\
  \nYou know those gloomy people who feel offended if they saw somebody smiling. Having\
  \ no \u200Eother choices, boys accepted the rules, and captain set sailed again.\u200E\
  \n\u200E The moment he decided to pass across Aswan Dam was the moment Aswan Dam\
  \ opened \u200Ecausing a severe flood of water, making the boat shine in the dance,\
  \ this time almost \u200Eoverturned.\u200E\nWater reached us. Prayers started to\
  \ rise, I picked my cellphone and called my fianc\xE9e \u200Esaying only two words:\u200E\
  \n\u200E\u201CI\u2019m sinking.\u201D\u200E\nA moment of silence, then I heard his\
  \ voice from a full mouth:\u200E\n\u200E\u201CI\u2019ll have my lunch, and call\
  \ you back.\u201D\u200E\n\u200E~\u200E\n\nIn the presence of Pharaohs, I had a strange\
  \ feeling. I was wondering in Karnak aimlessly \u200Eon the Sphinx Alley, reached\
  \ the Great Hypostyle Hall, sneaked in between the shrines and \u200Estatues, and\
  \ reached a statue that I felt a progressive desire to sit on his legs, it\u2019\
  s a bad \u200Ething, I know, and put me to trouble, but I felt that moment I\u2019\
  m in love with that good-looking \u200Epharaoh. I had to deceive the guard who knew\
  \ by nature I\u2019m going to do something odd and \u200Ekept an eye on me. So,\
  \ I kept hanging patiently around the statue and once I jumped into the \u200Epharaoh\u2019\
  s lap and\u2026 \"Psss\u2026 Psssss\", I asked a passenger to take a picture. Unfortunately,\
  \ the \u200Ephoto doesn\u2019t express my feelings towards the pharaoh, as my eyes\
  \ were busy looking for the \u200Eguard and heart busy beating the hell out of me!\u200E\
  \n \n\u200E~\u200E\nI can say I made a discovery: Pharaohs were very romantic.\u200E\
  \nAt Edfu Temple, there are delicate paintings on the walls recording Pharaonic\
  \ couples in \u200Eromantic positions; Two of them hold their hands tightly, other\
  \ woman holds her man\u2019s arm by \u200Eone hand, and the other surrounds his\
  \ shoulder, I\u2019ll not tell about the \u2018looks\u2019!\u200E\n\n \n \n\nAnd\
  \ near Abo Simbel Temple, of king \u201CRamsis ll\u201D, there is a temple for \u201C\
  Nefertari\u201D; just a \u200Eroyal gift to the beloved wife!\u200E\nAnd \u201C\
  Hatshepsut\u201D temple, the carved masterpiece inside the mountain like a deep\
  \ stab in \u200Ethe mountain\u2019s heart, her architect \u201CSennmot\u201D designed\
  \ it for her. And next to it, lies the \u200Etomb of Sennmot, who was not a husband\
  \ or a king to have his tomb near the royal one, but \u200E\u200E\"the lover\" he\
  \ was.\u200E\nRight place but wrong timing, why aren't I 7 thousand years younger?\u200E\
  \n\u200E~\u200E\n\nAfter some struggling, we made it to The Nubian Village, I stepped\
  \ \u2013 bravely \u2013 to the land, \u200EI was the first actually, yet, I didn't\
  \ feel relief. Girls followed, but the boys were a bit late, \u200EI turned my head\
  \ and looked at them: They were gathering efforts having the captain among \u200E\
  them batting, hitting and kicking him. Immediately I felt relieved. \u200E\n\u200E\
  ~\u200E\n\nWhen I got back to Cairo, I didn\u2019t forget to break up.\u200E\n\u200E\
