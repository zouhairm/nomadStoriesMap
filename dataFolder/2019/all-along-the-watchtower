Text: "Since I was a child, I enjoy looking back. Not only metaphorically, but literally.\
  \ When someone passes by me, I can\u2019t avoid to look back and observe that person\
  \ disappearing in the distance. It makes me feel powerful, I guess. \n\nThe second\
  \ biggest wall in the world, after the Chinese, breaks Western Sahara into two parts.\
  \ On one side, Moroccan lands. On the other, Sahrawi territories. Both sides have\
  \ been in conflict for more than 40 years. \n\nMarch, 2018. I am at the door of\
  \ a cinema school in the middle of the desert. \n\nSahrawi people live 100 kilometres\
  \ away from the wall. They used to be tireless shepherds, a nomadic nation, but\
  \ now they are prisoners in a vast jail of sand.\n\nAll along the watchtower, Dylan\u2019\
  s classic, is sounding through the windows of Mohammed\u2019s silver van while he\
  \ approaches the cinema school. A long black turban covers his head. \u201CAre you\
  \ the spaniard?\u201D, he asks me. \n\nI follow him through the corridors until\
  \ the student\u2019s room. The sand has turned the white walls of the school into\
  \ a symphony of brown colors. We sit together on the carpet and he offers me a glass\
  \ of red tea. \u201CWhat are you searching for?\u201D\n\nI tell him I am in Western\
  \ Sahara shooting a documentary and that he could help me to find a story. \n\n\
  Mohammed is a cinema student, just like myself. After a few teas, our inner selves\
  \ connect quickly, maybe because we both are fascinated with Bob Dylan and the freedom\
  \ his words transmit throughout time. \n \nTwilight is dominating the sky, so we\
  \ head towards a little hill to contemplate it. Near us, a woman gazes in solitude\
  \ the lights of the horizon. She is wearing a blue and yellow veil. Right next to\
  \ her, an old shepherd chases a rebel goat. I look back to observe him but Mohammed\
  \ reprimands me. \u201CDon\u2019t do that here\u201D. He smiles at me and we continue\
  \ walking uphill.\n\nThe refugee camp of Bojador has the aura of a cloudy dream.\
  \ While Mohammed hums a Dylan song, I can see a kid fixing a rusted bike and a cat\
  \ sleeping in an adobe window. \u201CIf you really want to understand my culture,\
  \ you must visit the wall\u201D, he tells me.\n\nA few days pass and I am in Mohammed\u2019\
  s silver van heading towards the border. On the road we encounter a Bedouin guiding\
  \ a herd of camels. His back is curved but his steps are firm. I can feel nostalgia\
  \ in the eyes of Mohammed. He comes from a family of nomads, but the war against\
  \ Morocco ended that way of life for the majority of Sahrawis.\n\nWe arrive to our\
  \ destiny and Mohammed asks me to be cautious before leaving the van. In front of\
  \ my eyes, I can see an infinite dune full of watchtowers. Protecting one of them,\
  \ a young Moroccan soldier observes us.\n\n\u201CMy true land\u201D, Mohammed whispers.\
  \ \n\nCovered by desert\u2019s silence, we face the wall for several minutes. The\
  \ Moroccan soldier remains still, holding Mohammed's gaze, and I can\u2019t avoid\
  \ thinking of my favourite verse in All along the watchtower: \u201CThere must be\
  \ some way out of here\u201D. \n\nI wonder if the young Moroccan is thinking the\
  \ same thing.\n\nWalking towards the van, I feel the need of looking back. The soldier\
  \ is still there, staring at me, and on this occasion I am the one who averts the\
  \ eyes.\n\nIt feels like a defeat. Now I may begin to understand what it means to\
  \ be born in the middle of a war you haven\u2019t chosen. Mohammed doesn\u2019t\
  \ look back. He enters the van without saying a word. \n\nI don\u2019t know too\
  \ much about the Sahrawi-Moroccan conflict. I don\u2019t understand who are the\
  \ good guys and the bad guys. All I know is that there is an immense wall full of\
  \ watchtowers condemning two young men to be enemies. \n\nSitting in the van, through\
  \ the rear mirror I discern two Sahrawi women praying under a solitary tree. I turn\
  \ around to observe them while Mohammed starts humming a Dylan song. \u201COn the\
  \ road again\u201D, he whispers."
