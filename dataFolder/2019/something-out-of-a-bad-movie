Text: "The Balkan War had been over for a decade and the war tourists had basically\
  \ subsided. The remnants of war-torn Sarajevo had cross blurred into the same old\
  \ string of coffee bars that was expected of Western Europe. The \"seljani\" were\
  \ not masking themselves in designer clothes and large round-framed glasses pretending\
  \ like nothing ever happened. The disdain for the different ethnicities was hidden\
  \ in the glances shared as you would walk through the city centar. What became evident\
  \ that despite all their differences, there remained an unspoken bond between all\
  \ the Sarajevans that remained in the country throughout the 5-year-long war. \n\
  \     Mirko fancied himself as the man about town. His personal claim to fame was\
  \ that during the filming of the film, \"Welcome To Sarajevo,\" he was the personal\
  \ bodyguard of Marisa Tomei. Despite all the stories of all of their adventures\
  \ together, he never seemed to get one photo with her. We wrote it off that people\
  \ taking pictures with their cell phones was not a big act to capture life's special\
  \ moments in the mid-'90s. I met Mirko at a bar in his neighborhood of Ciglane.\
  \ As I was sitting at the bar trying to strike up a conversation with the bartender,\
  \ I remarked upon a song that was playing on the radio. I didn't understand what\
  \ the singer was saying, but it was a nice 80's rock anthem with heavy accordion\
  \ play, which seemed to be signature to a lot of Bosnian music. The bartender knew\
  \ as much English as I spoke Bosnian, so we weren't destined to be life-long pen\
  \ pals. In the midst of our awkward silence arose a voice which professed, \"I know\
  \ him.\" \n     I look over to my right and a few stools down along the bar sat\
  \ a middle-aged man with a full head of gray hair drinking what appeared to be white\
  \ zinfandel out of a glass with the bar's logo on it. He held a Marlboro Light close\
  \ to his mouth and squinted as though the sun was in his eyes. He wore a light-tan\
  \ leather vest and some faded jeans and work shoes. From his rough-skinned hands,\
  \ I assumed that this was a laboring man. He looked as though he had worked a lot\
  \ of long hours for a lot of years. \n     I turned to the man excited that there\
  \ may be an opportunity for discussion here. There weren't many Americans hanging\
  \ out in Sarajevo, just for fun in 2004. I said, \"what did you say?\" knowing exactly\
  \ what he had said. He told me he knew the man on the radio. The singer's name was\
  \ Tifa and he played with a band called, Bijelo Dugme (White Buttons). As a world\
  \ traveler, I am not a novice to people sharing unbelievable stories of their less\
  \ than epic lives. So, I asked him more. What I discovered, was that I was talking\
  \ to someone that was probably one-degree of separation from everyone else in the\
  \ Former Yugoslavia. He and I obviously had nowhere to be that day, so we shared\
  \ a couple of bottles of wine. Not two hours later, and I suspect that he felt that\
  \ I didn't whole-heartedly believe his story, he lures me with him in his beat-up\
  \ Yugo 4 car to a back alley behind the city cemetery.\n     We parked at the end\
  \ of the street and had to walk in because there was nowhere to turn around in the\
  \ alley. If you drove straight in, you had to back out. Mirko led me to a tall wooden\
  \ door and looked directly into a camera. He didn't knock. He didn't ring a doorbell.\
  \ I hear a buzz and Mirko opens the door and leads me to a beautiful restaurant.\
  \ We walk up to a table of people that knew Mirko well enough that they weren't\
  \ excited to see him but were happy to see him. He introduced me as Kris, an American.\
  \ It was an unusual assortment of folks you wouldn't typically put together. Among\
  \ the few at the table was none other than Tifa Mladen Vujicic, the former lead\
  \ singer of Bijelo Dugme. I learned more about Bosnia that night than any movie."
