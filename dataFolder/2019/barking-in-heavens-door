Text: "\"Life is either a daring adventure or nothing at all\" Helen Keller\n\n  \
  \  Lying on a bed, gaze lost somewhere on the ceiling and listening the harmonious\
  \ crashing of drops against the window, there I was in an eight-bed smelly bedroom\
  \ on a cheap, dirty hostel in Hamburg.\n\nFour days ago, my spicy odorous Philippine\
  \ host made of my knowledge that on Saturday I needed to checkout for the place\
  \ has been booked out for the whole weekend. I knew that wasn\u2019t the real reason;\
  \ it was already my second month there, I\u2019m talking about end of February,\
  \ and for the past three weeks I was paying half price, considering one day I woke\
  \ up with bed bug bites, so I realized he was just getting rid of me in a polite\
  \ way. \n\nHamburg isn\u2019t the best place to visit the first months of the year,\
  \ it\u2019s cold as hell, and pretty much always rainy and foggy, a yellow brick\
  \ road to depression if things are not going your way and I was on that path, two\
  \ months trying to find a job unsuccessfully, two months living in a place dirtier\
  \ than a pigpen, two months of accomplishing nothing for what I was there for.\n\
  \nAbout noon, I slowly walked to the counter with my baggage ready to do the checkout,\
  \ and emotionless, I asked  my host, while I was handing him my key card, if I could\
  \ leave my suitcase there while I looked for a place to stay, he replied that it\
  \ was ok, I mean he was aware of my current situation, we had been practically roommates\
  \ for the last two months. Now I was jobless, broke and no place to crash, what\
  \ a movie clich\xE9 I thought.\n\nI walked into the metro station, jumped in the\
  \ wagon, destination unknown, I sat and begun watching through the window like Rachel\
  \ Watson, getting mad at me for thinking that it was going to be easy, while I was\
  \ watching the clouds over the horizon passing by, resembling an old woman\u2019\
  s hair waving in the wind. I stepped out in G\xE4nsemarkt an old square in downtown\
  \ that I have always like and has a Starbucks.\n\n I only had fifty euros in my\
  \ pocket, but at that time I didn\u2019t care about anything, so I bought a six\
  \ euro coffe and sat in the middle of the square in front of Ephraim Lessing\xB4\
  s monument. At that moment I began to think about my options, I wasn\u2019t going\
  \ to call my parents for more money, that was a promise I had made to myself, so\
  \ I called the only good friend I did during that time in the hostel, it actually\
  \ was the most promising option; I called him and he was in Berlin, he told me \u201C\
  you should go to the Instant Sleep Hostel, it\u2019s more expensive but at least\
  \ it\u2019s cleaner\u201D. I hung up and stared at the sky while drinking my six\
  \ euro coffe and said to God \u201CThis is what you wanted? You wanted to see me\
  \ fail?, I am not gonna give you that pleasure, I\u2019ll pay for two days in the\
  \ new hostel and sleep like I deserve to, if after that I have to sleep under a\
  \ bridge it doesn\u2019t matter, I won\u2019t fall apart and you are not defeating\
  \ me, I\u2019ll get out of this one way or another\u201D.\n\nI finished my coffee\
  \ and went to the new hostel, it was way better than the old one but twice more\
  \ expensive, I paid for two nights, forty-two euros total. So I had left two euros,\
  \ but a hole new attitude against adversity. I went to pick my baggage to the old\
  \ hostel and the little Philippine opened the door and the first thing that he says\
  \ was \u201CAre you still looking for job?\u201D and I incredulous said yes, then\
  \ he replied, \u201CI fired the cleaning lady, are you interested?\u201D \n\nEnough\
  \ said, that day started a new chapter in my life, and I learned that before you\
  \ can succeed you need to struggle, fight your battles. As the old saying goes,\
  \ \u201CGod tightens but doesn\u2019t choke\u201D."
