Text: "I look out of the window as the bus winds slowly up the mountainside. As the\
  \ altitude rises, the forest erupts with the rusty colours of Autumn. The hills\
  \ are coated in a low mist. Temples and monasteries dot the mountain roads, framed\
  \ by a red and orange riot of Japanese maple trees. \n\nThe bus staggers to a halt\
  \ and I step out into the cold mountain air. Our guide, Kiki, leads us along the\
  \ main street of Koya-San; a jumble of shop fronts and shy gardens set back slightly\
  \ from the road. Eventually, we arrive at the Buddhist temple that will be home\
  \ for the night. The monastery is like nowhere I\u2019ve ever seen; all ancient\
  \ wooden eaves, tatami mats and quiet landscaped gardens.\n\nAfter dropping off\
  \ our bags, we join a tour of Okunoin Cemetery; the burial place of K\u014Db\u014D\
  -Daishi, founder of the Shingon sect of Buddhism. At the entrance we stop at a small\
  \ stone fountain to cleanse ourselves, rinsing our hands and mouths with fresh water,\
  \ before entering one of the most sacred spots in the whole of Japan. \n\nA rocky\
  \ path leads steeply downwards. By now the sun has set and lanterns cast a dim glow\
  \ over the dizzying cedar trees and moss-covered tombstones. We cross another bridge\
  \ and a pavilion comes into view; lined with lamps that flicker in the dark, warming\
  \ the cold November air. These lanterns, we are told, have been burning for over\
  \ 900 years. \n\nThe monks lead us behind the building to the tomb where, they tell\
  \ us, K\u014Db\u014D-Daishi sits in an eternal meditation. We are asked to close\
  \ our eyes, as four monks recite sutras in a low baritone, their voices filling\
  \ the still night air. The hairs on my arm stand on end. \n\nEventually, it\u2019\
  s time to wind our way back up the hill towards the monastery. I walk beside one\
  \ of the monks, who introduces himself as Sui. When he discovers that I\u2019m British,\
  \ he\u2019s keen to tell me all about the time he spent studying as an exchange\
  \ student at the University of Manchester.  That\u2019s how I end up on top of a\
  \ mountain in Japan, discussing Sunday dinners and the Manchester nightlife with\
  \ a Buddhist monk.\n\nAs we climb back up the hill, I turn to him, saying \u201C\
  I hope you don\u2019t mind me asking, but how did you train to become a monk?\u201D\
  \ He tells me animatedly about the mornings spent rising before dawn to clean the\
  \ monastery, mastering even the most menial tasks, with hours more spent on prayer\
  \ and meditation. The training is fraught with difficulties, he tells me, but the\
  \ trainee monks must learn the lessons hidden in those daily challenges. \n\nThe\
  \ novices must learn the lessons concealed in nature too, he says. Like the lotus\
  \ flower, which thrives in murky pond water, serving as a reminder that beauty and\
  \ goodness can grow even in the harshest environments. Sui tells me that, just like\
  \ the lotus, people can thrive under challenging circumstances. It\u2019s just up\
  \ to us to have the clarity to turn challenges into opportunities to build a better\
  \ version of ourselves.\n\nIt strikes me that the monk\u2019s life is worlds away\
  \ from my own day-to-day existence back in London; but something he says rings true.\
  \ Then it strikes me; maybe life isn\u2019t just about striving for some eventual\
  \ happiness. Maybe we have to make our own happiness, here and now. Perhaps the\
  \ key is just an open mind, perceptiveness and a dedication to being a better person\
  \ than you were yesterday.\n\nSoon, the monastery comes back into view and I say\
  \ goodbye to Sui with a warm smile. The following day, I jump on the Shinkansen,\
  \ speeding me towards the flashing billboards and dim karaoke bars of Tokyo. But\
  \ a little bit of that night in Koya-San remains with me. \n\nMy encounter with\
  \ the monk reminded me that travelling isn\u2019t just about collecting postcards,\
  \ ticking off a bucket list, or taking shots for Instagram \u2013 although those\
  \ are all fine too. It\u2019s about acquiring new ideas and perspectives that follow\
  \ us through life, whispering to us like voices echoing in the cold mountain air."
