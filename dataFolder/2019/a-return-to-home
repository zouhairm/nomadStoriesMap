Text: "I didn't expect to find a part of myself simply by being home.\nYet, lost and\
  \ lingering, a part of my soul was waiting to be retrieved. Waiting, in fact, for\
  \ 20 years.\n\nUpon entering through the gates of the family compound, the smells\
  \ were the first thing that hit me.\nWafting on the stifling tropical breeze, the\
  \ scent of familiar laundry detergent, boiling rice, and jepun flowers tickled my\
  \ nose.\n\nAlmost instantly, my mind was flooded with memories of a life long since\
  \ forgotten: The perfumed taste of holy water, the itchy scratch of my kebaya shirt\
  \ scrunched over my sarong at temple\u2026\n\nA voice reaches me and brings me back\
  \ from my visit with my memories.\nI look up and see a smiling, age-weathered face.\
  \ Despite decades having passed, my grandmother looked exactly as I remembered her.\
  \ \"Ariana?\"\nI smile broadly in return, \"Tu Niang!\"\n\nMore voices and faces\
  \ begin to emerge from various doors and enclaves of the family compound.\nAunts\
  \ and uncles whose names and faces I can\u2019t place grin widely as they approach\
  \ me, bombarding me excitedly with questions. Questions that I could only return\
  \ with a smile and befuddled look on my face.\n\n\"Ariana, you no speak Bahasa??\"\
  \ My uncle asks me in broken English.\n\"No\", I say sheepishly...\"I have forgotten\"\
  .\nTrying not to flinch in embarrassment, I make eye contact with each of my now\
  \ gathered family members, expecting hurt to shine in their eyes for me not knowing\
  \ their language, my own mother tongue.\n\nI had been warned by a family friend\
  \ not to be surprised if my family didn't come off warmly after all these years,\
  \ and that outright affection wasn't always common among Balinese. Therefore, I\
  \ was only slightly shocked when suddenly I was being embraced by arms from every\
  \ direction, my face held between many pairs of hands as my cheeks were vigorously\
  \ sniffed (the Balinese equivalent of a cheek kiss by way of greeting).\n\nBroad\
  \ smiles met mine, and I was ushered to a chair to share some makan (food) from\
  \ the local market.\nAnimated chatter continued flitting all around me, and I could\
  \ only smile as emotions that had lied dormant for 20 years were brought to the\
  \ surface.\n\nThe emotions I felt in that moment, however, were nothing compared\
  \ to what I felt a few hours later. The moment when I first beheld my father, whom\
  \ I had also not seen since I was seven years old.\n \nHis face looked so different\
  \ from how I remembered him, but his smile was the same. As we embraced for the\
  \ first time, he whispered in my ear \u201CI miss you so much, Ariana\u201D.\n\u201C\
  Me too, Dad. You have no idea. How are you\u201D? \nHe gently pushed back from our\
  \ embrace, his eyes full of sadness and said, \u201CSorry, I no remember any more\
  \ English...you speak Bahasa, yeah?\u201D.\n\nIf I had been embarrassed before,\
  \ the feeling turned to heartbreak as I realized my father could no longer communicate\
  \ in English, having not used it since he and my mother were together, before we\
  \ moved back to the states. Twenty years to share with each other, and we didn't\
  \ speak each other\u2019s language.\nFeeling hollow as my chest tightened and my\
  \ rising tears betrayed my smile, I looked away hoping no one would notice. My father\
  \ only took me in his arms once more, and while he held me, the weight of our silent\
  \ emotions pressed upon us like a tangible presence. \n\n                      \
  \                                                                              \
  \              ***\n\nBefore we parted ways late that evening, our time more light-hearted\
  \ after a few hours getting comfortable with one another and practicing English\
  \ together, my dad turns to me and says, \u201CI will go home now to sleep. But\
  \ tomorrow, do you want to meet your brother and sisters?\u201D\n\nGrowing up an\
  \ only child, I had always dreamed of having siblings. I emphatically nodded yes.\
  \ My dad again took me in his arms in a final good night\u2019s embrace. This time,\
  \ instead of empty, I felt so very full. I realized in that moment, if we could\
  \ not use words to communicate, we would use love. \n\nAnd that said everything."
