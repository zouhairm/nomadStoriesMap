Text: "Getting distance from a reality is the only way to look at it from a different\
  \ perspective, the one you'll need to realize how wonderful it is in all its imperfections.\n\
  I got to know to have been hired in UAE during my graduation day. Ten days later\
  \ I was flying to the craziest city on earth, having in mind to spend there 3 months,\
  \ just to get experience, and then come back. But no way to follow my plans as I\
  \ wanted. \nI got out of the airport and I couldn't breath. Sweating already, water\
  \ was stacking on my skin. \"E questo non \xE8 nieeente bedda mia!\", Marco told\
  \ me with his lovely Sicilian accent, helping me with my luggages, with those big\
  \ blue transparent eyes which could make clear and fun and shining everything around\
  \ you.\nThe first weeks over there were simply crazy. Absolutely no clue about what\
  \ I was doing, where I was, why, with whom. Everything around me was so huge, high,\
  \ wow, too much for a girl from an Italian southern village with 7000 souls.  Little\
  \ time later I was celebrating Christmas with 15 friends in my bedroom, Selvyn praying\
  \ for us, me holding the Bible, everyone believing in his own God (or whatever).\n\
  The time was flying away, I was growing up and I didn't know. The more they were\
  \ pushing me the more I was learning.\nBut the best part of my journey has been\
  \ something which any 7 stars hotel can replace: people. Everyone of them had his\
  \ own drama which became part of my drama, we founded each other, we completed each\
  \ other. When you're alone in a city where everything is so fake, birds are not\
  \ singing, the sun shines but doesn\u2019t make you tanned, you look for something\
  \ which can keep you warm.\nI got people from Uzbekistan who could sing Adriano\
  \ Celentano's songs with a perfect Italian pronunciation, people providing me broccolini\
  \ instead of bunch of roses to start the shift, people calling me \"miss Napoli\"\
  \ just because I knew where to look for something and get it, \"sunshine\", \"fighter\"\
  . I got people who knew how to read me even though I was not talking that much,\
  \ just being myself.\nI will never forget about the people met randomly on the beach\
  \ while I was enjoying a sunset alone, when the pink shadows of the sky were reflecting\
  \ on the glass of the windows of the tall skyscrapers, and everything seemed to\
  \ be a huge mirror you were part of. I will never forget about the friends coming\
  \ to my room without permission, opening the wardrobe, choosing a dress and pulling\
  \ me by my feet to convince me to get out of the bed when I really didn't want to\
  \ go party. I hated and I loved them so much, I am so thankful. I will never forget\
  \ the post it and the flowers left at the hostess desk for me, the teas made every\
  \ half an hour when I had the flue and just an espresso more when they needed a\
  \ favor. They knew me.\nI feel to have left something behind and to carry something\
  \ huge inside me. It's something that no picture, no song, no nothing in the world\
  \ can represent. It's written inside of me and it comes with me.\nToday I look at\
  \ myself from a different perspective. I know myself better and I know that I am\
  \ not the perfect person I used to think to be. And I love this. \nThe point is\
  \ that when you live an experience with all your commitment, with authenticity and\
  \ just being yourself with no filters you make memories, big souvenirs and when\
  \ you have to leave all this it's so hard. How can you push in a baggage something\
  \ huge like that? With a broken heart, I have to say goodbye.\nBut, \"A heart that's\
  \ broken it's a heart that's been loved\".\nThat's why I look back at all the people\
  \ who has been part of this, I see them smiling at me and I just acknowledge to\
  \ be lucky, blessed.\nI am alive."
