Text: "It\u2019s often said that an Australian doing a working holiday in an English\
  \ pub is as common as a pair of thongs, yet when  I came to the end of a job, with\
  \ nothing to do and decided to follow the footsteps of many other Australians heading\
  \ over to Europe for wider things, none of my friends had taken the trip, having\
  \ either continued on at university or straight into decent work, so I had no idea\
  \ of what to expect.\n\tI chose to go to an outer London pub rather than one right\
  \ in the city, and boy, what a pub did I score! Sitting right on the edge of the\
  \ Thames and opposite one of the little islands (known as aits) that dot along the\
  \ river, it was an idyllic spot where you could ignore the treeless and densely\
  \ built streets; and inside, surprise, surprise (?) all the other pub workers (apart\
  \ from the cook) were Australians.\n\tSo anyway, several months on, sitting downstairs\
  \ in one of the main bay windows eating our breakfast, I looked out and saw a little\
  \ older man looking through the gate and over the brick fence keeping the river\
  \ safe from the street (or vice versa). But then I did a double take \u2013 no way!\
  \ So I asked the one of the other people sitting with me what he thought \u2013\
  \ and he agreed, it was or looked very much like Bill Oddie. So we promptly ran\
  \ out and indeed, Bill Oddie it was, prepping for documentary on the aits of the\
  \ Thames. He very nicely let us take a photo with him, and we let him on with his\
  \ stuff.\n\tI did so much on the rest of that trip \u2013 went places and other\
  \ countries, forgot to go places (D\u2019oh!), spent time with friends, saw exhibitions,\
  \ plays, got a funny story about accents to tell, did stuff that the general public\
  \ can\u2019t do any more and even got my first boyfriend. But the Goodiest thing\
  \ of all was that random unplanned meeting. \nThe point of all this? Well, I guess\
  \ it\u2019s that everywhere is worth going to, the small and the big. So go where\
  \ you want to go, even if everyone else does it as well. You can never know what\
  \ is going to happen, because the choices you make are your own, based on you, so\
  \ it will always be an individual journey (even if it\u2019s on a bus with eight\
  \ other Aussies & listening to the Scottish bus driver\u2019s folk music), that\
  \ trip of a lifetime."
