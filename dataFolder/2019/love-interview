Text: "It all started with an interview I had to take in Li\xE8ge on August the 24th\
  \ 2015. I was living in London, and I had decided to travel by bus given the short\
  \ notice and the short budget on the day before, I was prepared for it, I had already\
  \ gone through those claustrophobic 35 minutes in the Eurotunnel countless times,\
  \ I had enough reading material to get me through those 7 hours just fine. Only\
  \ on that day, we heard the unexpected news of some migrants that were trying to\
  \ get through the tunnel on foot to reach the UK from Calais. We were told it was\
  \ gonna take a few hours, page after page and wandering around the limited shopping\
  \ and recreational area of the Eurotunnel, those few hours ended up to be nearly\
  \ 8. The bus carried on the journey smoothly, but adding up the time we were held\
  \ I reached Brussels North station at past midnight. I began to worry as I saw there\
  \ are no longer trains scheduled to reach my final destination, I asked the few\
  \ personnel left there at that time and they told me my next train would leave at\
  \ 6 in the morning and that they would be closing the station in a few minutes.\
  \ That would have given me enough time to get to my interview the next day, but\
  \ I would have been the victim of a sleepless and boring night, until... I saw a\
  \ girl who seemed to have my same problem, after that I recognised she was a passenger\
  \ on the bus I had just disembarked, she seemed to panic as she was understanding\
  \ she wouldn't have a place to stay for the night until her next train after 6 in\
  \ the morning. So with confidence I approached her and told her I was on her same\
  \ bus and I was having the same problem, I then just remembered of a fast food that's\
  \ open 24 hours \"I know a place that's open 24/7, I'm just gonna crash there and\
  \ chill...\" I was suggesting, \"Can I join you there?\" she promptly asked me,\
  \ \"Yes, it would definitely be a less boring night with someone else around me\"\
  . On the way to the place we kept talking, she's Asian, and having travelled around\
  \ Asia before I tried to guess her nationality \"Are you Korean?\", \"Yes! How did\
  \ you know?\" she replied with surprise. We grabbed a bite at the fast food, among\
  \ the talks I suggested we went sightseeing around and she agreed. After some minutes\
  \ of walking the dragging sound of our suitcases started getting overwhelmed by\
  \ the shouts of several drunk people shouting and clinking bottles of glass as we\
  \ were approaching the Stadhuis. The square looked better at night with the lights,\
  \ I thought, I had been there already a few times, but I had never seen it at night,\
  \ and sure had never seen it so filthy. The shattered glass was everywhere, but\
  \ we were not alone, we were sitting by the side, an homeless man was collecting\
  \ those unbroken bottles in a trolley, I guess he might have brought them to a refund\
  \ machine they usually have in supermarkets there that gives out an amount in voucher\
  \ to spend for every bottle. That's a good way to keep the environment clean, I\
  \ thought. We proceeded with our tour through the gallery of Saint-Hubert, the shops\
  \ were obviously closed, but it was much quieter and the windows were still displaying\
  \ the luxury goods they were selling. It's nice to look at stuff when nobody's around\
  \ in the shop or looking at you, you can stare at it and observe it as much as you\
  \ like. Time went by fast with her. We headed back to the station and I asked her\
  \ if we could be friends on social networks, and she accepted my request on the\
  \ spot. We left each other with a hug. The next morning was not as good as the evening,\
  \ I didn't get the job. But that girl, Jeeyeon, is now my wife."
