Text: "The doctor examined the two-inch gash carved into my shin. \u201CWhen did this\
  \ happen?\u201D\n\nI added the hours. The previous afternoon\u2019s Jeep ride through\
  \ southern Vietnam\u2019s pine forests, watching the blood leak down my leg. The\
  \ night spent hoping the bleeding would stop, and the morning discovering it had\
  \ not. Two hours waiting at a hectic hospital in soaked bandages before it abruptly\
  \ closed for lunch. A five-hour bus to this small beach town.\n\n\u201C30 hours\
  \ ago?\u201D I guessed. His eyes widened. He looked at my wound for another minute.\n\
  \n\u201CYou need stitches.\u201D \n\nHe gave me a fizzy liquid to drink and prepared\
  \ a needle. I looked away. When I was four years old, I would dash away screaming\
  \ before the doctor could wrangle me down for my shots. At 24 years old, I tried\
  \ to stay calm in a dingy clinic found from Googling \u201CEnglish-speaking doctor\
  \ Mui Ne.\u201D\n\n\u201CI\u2019m scared,\u201D I whimpered. The doctor\u2019s eyes\
  \ softened, and for a moment he looked like my father. My Chinese-American ethnicity\
  \ had confused dozens of Vietnamese locals over the past weeks. They would approach\
  \ me speaking Vietnamese, until they registered my sheepish smile. When I explained\
  \ I was American, they\u2019d look me up and down, and ask why I looked Asian. What\
  \ I at first found uncomfortable turned into affection for a country that treated\
  \ me like one of their own. One week prior, my bag had been snatched by motorbike\
  \ thieves, and one local after another helped me \u2013 chasing the thieves in vain,\
  \ finding police officers, and translating at the police station.\n\nThe doctor\
  \ touched my arm and promised it would only be a little pain.\n\nThirty hours ago,\
  \ I was hiking through a canyon along the Dasar River, in a group tour led by two\
  \ local guides. We learned to rappel from a rope tied to a tree trunk, and by afternoon,\
  \ we\u2019d accomplished an 18-meter waterfall and 32-meter cliff.\n\nThe grand\
  \ finale was a 65-meter waterfall. I stepped to the edge and took in the view of\
  \ sprawling evergreen forests in Vietnam\u2019s central highlands. Trying to keep\
  \ my fear of heights at bay, I trusted in my harness and descended, struggling to\
  \ keep my legs perpendicular. I leaned forward as I strained to hear our guide shout\
  \ something down to me, just as my feet slipped on rushing water and my body slammed\
  \ against the rocks.\n\nHanging in my harness, I glanced down and felt the paralysis\
  \ of fear slowly taking hold. A sharp rock jutting out had gouged out a chunk of\
  \ my shin. The second guide was at the bottom, 40 meters down. The first guide was\
  \ no longer in sight. I breathed. I hoisted my feet up, and my descent to the bottom\
  \ was a blur of rocks, water and blood. My clearest thought was wondering whether\
  \ the white exposed in my shin was bone. When I reached the ground, I motioned over\
  \ the guide. I cried in front of six strangers as he doused my leg with iodine and\
  \ wrapped it in bandages. The guides insisted a hospital visit was unnecessary,\
  \ and I believed them, until the bleeding wouldn\u2019t stop.\n\nJust as the doctor\
  \ promised, my first stitches were only a little pain. I left the clinic with a\
  \ shockingly low bill\u2013$25 without insurance. I kept traveling. I hobbled through\
  \ southern Vietnam and Cambodia and cleaned my wound every night. One month later,\
  \ I arrived in Bangkok and visited a sparkling hospital to see if I was healed enough\
  \ to go in the ocean. \u201COh my God,\u201D the doctor gasped at my wound. She\
  \ ripped the scab off, declared it infected, and gave me antibiotics to start the\
  \ healing process over again.\n\nToday, my two-inch teardrop scar on my right shin\
  \ is five shades of pink, hidden by black tights in the New York winter. The question\
  \ I get most after returning from my backpacking trip is \u201CWhat was your favorite\
  \ country?\u201D I despise it, because how can I possibly simplify seven months\
  \ of joy, adventure, grit and heartache into one superlative? So I rephrase it,\
  \ and answer, \u201CThe country where I grew the most was Vietnam.\u201D"
