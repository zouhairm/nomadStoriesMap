Text: "Positano has been my dream for years now and I am SO happy this was one of\
  \ the locations we were able to go on our couple travel. We stayed in Atrani, then\
  \ visited Positano a few of the days. There are the prettiest beaches everywhere\
  \ and the buildings on the cliffsides are unreal. If you are considering going to\
  \ Italy, definitely try and make the Amalfi Coast a priority!\n\nWe did a private\
  \ boat tour at sunset to  and it was amazing to see the city from the water! There\
  \ are lots of different companies you can book through but we used Positano Boats.\
  \ \n-GELATO: when in Italy you haaaave to stop at gelato shops when walking around.\
  \ Sooo good! \nSunrise and sunset are so beautiful! I only woke up for the sunrise\
  \ one of the days we were there and the colors were amazing.\nSomething that I LOVE\
  \ about so many places in Europe is the flower boxes on the huge windows and the\
  \ prettiest balconies. It\u2019s just so beautiful! \nWe stayed in an Airbnb that\
  \ had an outdoor private jacuzzi which was awesome! We pretty much always stay in\
  \ Airbnbs when we travel-I just think it's the way to go. \nThe cheapest time of\
  \ year to visit Italy is in the winter. From December to March, the cold weather\
  \ keeps most travelers at bay, and you can explore the country\u2019s incredible\
  \ museums and galleries to your heart\u2019s content.\n\nYou\u2019ll also be in\
  \ time for all the Christmas Markets and have an easier time finding cheap flights\
  \ to Italy. Another affordable period is between April and May.\n\nThe summer crowds\
  \ have yet to arrive, and the countryside is covered in a blanket of blossoming\
  \ flowers!\n\nItaly is one of the greatest places in the world; each city brings\
  \ its own type of beauty"
