Text: "Istanbul despite Hollywood\n\nAt the end of last year, we made the decision\
  \ to spend a different new years eve, totally different from all the ones that we\
  \ had spent in the history of our lives, many places came up in our conversation,\
  \ but this time, we put our destiny before the reason.\n\nWe agree that we will\
  \ not visit the places that our intellect or reason dictated, instead, we will take\
  \ a flight from a pre-established point -after four days visiting the place- looked\
  \ up for the cheapest flight and fly away, no matter where it was, simply following\
  \ the heart not the reason, as long as it was the cheapest flight and it take us\
  \ to another country, then so be it.\n\nThats the way that suddenly was in the table\
  \ the flight from Berlin, Germany to Istanbul, Turkey and with it, arises our most\
  \ irrational fears, I mean, the Hollywood film industry through a number of films\
  \ that has freed trough the world in decades, has made you believe that at the slightest\
  \ provocation you can go to jail for life, without any rights and in the most inhuman\
  \ conditions. \n\nYou imagine yourself according to your worst nightmares, that\
  \ you will end your days being the \"girlfriend\" of a semi-human being, almost\
  \ orangutan, that paints your lips and sodomizes you, if you are lucky, but could\
  \ be worst.\n\nYou also think that since your entry into the country, you will be\
  \ watched by a brutal police, repressive and if for some strange reason you seem\
  \ suspicious or for the simple fact of being Western or to cover the fee from their\
  \ boring work, they will exercise their authority in your person and You will get\
  \ into the mess of your life, leaving you bankrupt, vexed for life and traumatized\
  \ to attend it in endless psychological sessions.\n\nYou imagine that everyone will\
  \ walk down the street dressed in Taliban fashion (at least as the way of those,\
  \ who they present you in the movies) and women with strict Burka. Also that if\
  \ you don\u2019t kneel at the time of the call to pray, you would be stoned by a\
  \ crowd for be an infidel, in the good old fashion way.\n\nDespite all our stupid\
  \ and unfounded fears, fortunately our curiosity was and is always greater, and\
  \ thus Overcoming the deepest fears that American propaganda pours into your psyche\
  \ and after entrusting ourselves to the Gods, making our will, and of course,  contract\
  \ the broadest insurance in WorldNomads, we took a plane from Berlin to Istanbul.\n\
  \nFor us, the barrier language, always impacts, but is not fundamental, because\
  \ with a good electronic translator, a broad smile and a considerable number of\
  \ signs, we have always come out ahead. You will be surprised how many people speak\
  \ spanish -our mother tongue- or English.\n\nFrom the modernity of the Airport to\
  \ the old city, located in the Sultanahmed District is separated by a half hour\
  \ by taxi, I was struck by the number of huge cargo ships that can be seen in the\
  \ distance and are anchored in their coasts, I imagine their crews waiting to depart,\
  \ patiently killing time playing cards, listening sticky music with a glass of rum\
  \ on their hands and in a continuous succession of splendid sunrises and majestic\
  \ sunsets, like the one that I live that day.\n\nIstanbul, is not only on the border\
  \ of two continents, but is the obligatory way for trade between Europe, Asia and\
  \ Russia, through the Bosphorus that connects the Black Sea with the Marmara Sea\
  \ and the Mediterranean.\n\nIstanbul was love at first sight and I count the days\
  \ \"to return to your arms again\", as a famous old Mexican folk song sings.\n\n\
  Instead of making our worst nightmares come true, we find above all things a safe,\
  \ modern, comfortable, with all services, clean, a well preserved and wonderful\
  \ historical sites, very nice people, respectful, incredibly tasty food, culture\
  \ trade and history in every corner.\n\nBut what amazed me the most was the respect\
  \ for all races and religions, for animals, by the way, there are hundreds of cats\
  \ and dogs in the streets in a peaceful coexistence among all living beings."
