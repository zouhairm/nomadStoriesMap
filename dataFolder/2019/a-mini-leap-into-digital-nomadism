Text: "I rushed to the station in the early evening to catch my train to St Pancreas\
  \ where the Eurostar train departs to Brussels. This was my mini leap into the unknown\
  \ lifestyle of digital nomadism. \nMBO Partners' 2018 State of Independence in America\
  \ looked into digital nomadism. They discovered 17 million self-directed workers\
  \ seek to some time or another end up as digital nomads, a term referencing specialists\
  \ who grasp a location-independent, innovation empowered way of life that enables\
  \ them to travel and work remotely. I would hopefully beat the strange anxiety that\
  \ I had developed around remote working.\nI was about to loose my Eurostar virginity.\
  \ London St Pancreas provided a streamlined user experience. Oddly there were two\
  \ passport points: one for the UK border control and the other for the French border\
  \ control 5 paces away. \nI would be on the continent in less than 2 hours. The\
  \ train sauntered into the station Brussels Midi near to midnight. Like most train\
  \ stations at that time of night it didn\u2019t seem the safest. As I walked in\
  \ the night through beautifully lit streets, it was like the city wanted to give\
  \ me its best impression. This didn\u2019t really last; because when as I got to\
  \ my hotel and a lady was sat in the living room lightly farting at regular intervals\
  \ in the corner.  \nThe next day is the first of mini leap into digital nomadism.\
  \ I look for a caf\xE9 with Wi-Fi and plug sockets, which every digital nomad has\
  \ added as a psychological need along with food, water, warmth, and rest. The caf\xE9\
  \ nearby proves a good option with its lattes and warm cinnamon rolls. I feel at\
  \ home here as others sit at their table behind their screens. The whole menu is\
  \ in English, which I question. The reply is \u201Cthis is Brussels\u201D. Like\
  \ I\u2019m meant to know about the level of globalisation in the city.\nI have my\
  \ first online meeting. I ask the lady next to me to plug me in to the socket, but\
  \ it\u2019s busy. She laughs as I present her with an extension lead that has a\
  \ European continental plug. She can\u2019t argue with that. I\u2019m prepared for\
  \ nomadism and I\u2019m secretly proud.\nThe man next to me eavesdrops on the whole\
  \ conversation and proudly admits it as he opens a conversation with me after the\
  \ call. There isn\u2019t much privacy here.  \nIn the early afternoon the waitress\
  \ collides with another one, delivering a huge wet patch to her colleague. She spills\
  \ a large latte all over her and the rest splashes on the floor. My coat opposite\
  \ me escapes. It rests on a chair for the day that I am using as my left luggage.\
  \ The chair is also stopping my newly purchased purple hard cased hand luggage from\
  \ taking off on its own journey.\nThe day passes, appointments continue and then\
  \ 8 hours later the caf\xE9 turns to a busy evening vibe. I'm talking to no one,\
  \ but the man next to me who had been eavesdropping earlier is now with his new\
  \ fling, rubbing noses. It is getting awkward now. I'm wondering when these waitresses\
  \ are going to say something about how I\u2019ve been here since 11 am. I've had\
  \ a productive day. I really love this place but sadly I haven't seen so much of\
  \ Brussels.\nThe French eavesdropper\u2019s evening plans were now being decided\
  \ on as he suggested to his lover that they should make a night of it tonight via\
  \ the pharmacy, wink wink. They rub noses more than I am comfortable with. In the\
  \ UK affection isn't really so outwardly expressed in public. I now felt due the\
  \ close proximity of the table in the cafe that I might as well have been in their\
  \ bed next to them, as they were publicly spooning. He politely said good luck to\
  \ me when they left together and wished me well with my digital nomadism. I thanked\
  \ him and also wished him luck. I think I wasn't considering his career."
