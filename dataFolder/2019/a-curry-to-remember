Text: "The flashy signage, its neon lights piercing through the dark alleys of Havana\u2019\
  s old town, was itself an anomaly. It helped draw our attention though - to the\
  \ only Indian restaurant in all of Cuba. My tummy did a happy, albeit guilty, somersault\
  \ at the promise of familiar flavours from back home. Whatever happened to the resolution\
  \ of eating local. The total absence of golden arches and cheery colonels had made\
  \ sticking to this resolve easy\u2026up until this point.\n\nA green 50s Plymouth\
  \ that had driven into the narrow lane slowed down, the driver\u2019s impatient\
  \ glare urging us to get out of his way. As if on cue, we stepped inside the restaurant,\
  \ tentatively. Posters of iconic Hindi films and Indian pop art made me all fuzzy\
  \ inside, but also had me flummoxed at the incongruity of it all. This little Indian\
  \ outpost was in the heart of Cuba. Two countries that had precious little in common\
  \ - no joint borders, no shared history, no collective ideology. \n\n\u201CHad I\
  \ endured a 24 hour journey from Australia only to wallow in the familiarity of\
  \ the culture I was raised in. Shouldn\u2019t I be out there in the by lanes of\
  \ old Havana chatting up yet another erstwhile revolutionary and seeking out still\
  \ more little-known Cuban music haunts.\u201D\n\nI scanned the restaurant furtively.\
  \ The place was empty, save for two British men tearing into their naan bread. As\
  \ we pored over the menu, we were greeted by a kitchen hand. Hailing from Northern\
  \ India, he was delighted to see diners from the sub-continent. I was about to launch\
  \ into another \u201Cso much for meeting locals\u201D mental admonishment when he\
  \ mentioned that married to a Havana local, he was now as Cuban as could be. Partial\
  \ redemption. \n\nOutside, the evening was picking up momentum. Amidst the clinking\
  \ of cutlery and the hum of conversation, typical Havana sounds were wafting in\
  \ from the streets - a bongo beat here, a maracas jiggle there. Much as it tasted\
  \ authentic, the chicken tikka on my plate suddenly looked woefully out of place.\n\
  \nA bunch of Cuban diners who had sauntered in commented on the tikka animatedly.\
  \ Their interest, clearly not a consequence of disdain, but of anticipation at the\
  \ prospect of food that was so far removed from Ropa Vieja, the Cuban national dish.\
  \ The group was here to celebrate a special occasion, and the young girl who led\
  \ the pack couldn\u2019t stop marvelling at the kitschy d\xE9cor, the Indian diners\
  \ and this generous helping of distant exotica that was on offer so close to home.\
  \ \n\nDinner service was peaking. A few more Indian tourists showed up. Followed\
  \ by a German couple. There was then an excited bustle among the staff - the kind\
  \ that ensues when popular regulars visit. In this instance, it was a Pakistani\
  \ diplomat along with his multi-cultural family. Introductions done, we were soon\
  \ comparing notes about tikkas and daals on either side of the border. A sentiment\
  \ lost on his young Eurasian son, whose only contribution to the conversation was\
  \ Spanish monosyllables. \n\nWhile we were busy tucking in, a trio of Cuban musicians\
  \ had taken centre-stage. From foot-tapping local hits to Buena Vista Social Club\u2019\
  s chartbusting numbers, their infectious music couldn\u2019t have been more incongruous\
  \ with chicken tikka. \n\nAt that instant, the blurring line between local and global\
  \ was all but obliterated. Here we were, at first sight, just an innocuous bunch\
  \ of diners. But, more tellingly, a microcosm of the world today, free of restrictive\
  \ delineations. United in this moment in time simply by a love of curry and jazz.\n\
  \nOut on a street in old Havana, two chevys get into a noisy face off. Meanwhile,\
  \ inside an Indian restaurant on the same street, a motley gang of residents and\
  \ tourists from the far reaches of the globe join a team of musicians as they play\
  \ \u2018Happy Birthday\u2019. And my other half, belly full of comfort food, bashfully\
  \ blows out the candle that\u2019s perched atop a lime wedge on his Cuban mojito."
