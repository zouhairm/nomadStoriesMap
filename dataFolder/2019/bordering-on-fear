Text: "I tossed my bag into the luggage compartment and hauled myself onto yet another\
  \ sleeper buss as I began to bid farewell to Ho Chi Minh City. A quick self pat-down\
  \ ensured I had everything I needed to hit the road. I skipped up the stairs towards\
  \ my low-lying seat, thrust myself back and fixated my view on the manic ongoings\
  \ outside. \n\nHo Chi Minh had been a speed-run compared to other parts of Vietnam.\
  \ The city operates on a 24 hour basis with the handbrake firmly off. It had been\
  \ exhilarating and tiresome at the same time. I had enjoyed, but I was also looking\
  \ forward to pastures new. The hustle and bustle of lights and busy roads was going\
  \ to give way to a rural drive towards the Cambodian border. A welcome relief in\
  \ many ways. I shut my eyes and tried to cram in as much sleep as I could. \n\n\
  A few hours later I woke in a sweaty daze. I clutched at my pocket feeling around\
  \ for my passport and some loose change. \"I'm all good,\" I thought to myself before\
  \ launching into an internal tirade about the overuse of vehicle horns on the Vietnamese\
  \ roads. I had slept, but it was far from relaxing. \n\nAs my senses came to I realised\
  \ we were in fact at the Cambodian border crossing. Other passengers began to hop\
  \ off and I followed suit. I slipped into my flip flops and made my way through\
  \ the customs. It was the early hours and everyone appeared semi-conscious. Not\
  \ me. I recalled tales told to me by others of troubles crossing between two Asian\
  \ countries. \"I won't happen to me,\" I thought, \"not me.\" \n\nI made my way\
  \ to the desk. I was visually interrogated by the officer perched behind the perspex\
  \ glass and stood there for what felt like an age. The pause stretched and stretched.\
  \ He pointed left. I had been told to make my way over to an office that was offset\
  \ from the main walkway. I had not been let through. \n\nInside the office was a\
  \ bench and several officers dressed in teal blue suits. I sat down next to a woman\
  \ who looked to be emotionally numb. She was in her 30's or so. I almost felt like\
  \ we were in this ordeal together, bound by our stresses and worries. I was visibly\
  \ anxious and I think she realised. I had little previous experience of such situations.\
  \ \n\n\"Wrong visa!\" they shouted at me. I rustled my hand around my pocket looking\
  \ for a sheet which had legitimate confirmation. I had bought my visa before ever\
  \ entering Vietnam. I was entitled to a month long stay. I had done nothing wrong.\
  \ \"Wrong visa!\" they shouted again. I retorted and bit back but there was a clear\
  \ language barrier. My anger before to come to a swell at the fact I felt I was\
  \ being cheated. \"It's not your visa confirmation they want. It's money.\" The\
  \ lady to my right clearly knew more than me. \"You've got to pay they have your\
  \ passport. I'm waiting here for someone to bring me my cash.\" My God she was clearly\
  \ right. \n\n\"My diligence to check my pockets before getting onto the bus might\
  \ just get me out of this mess,\" I thought. I had a couple of notes change left\
  \ in my pocket. I whipped them out and began to negotiate my entrance into Cambodia.\
  \ There was a toing and frowing in conversation before a fee was finally settled.\
  \ I was handed my passport back, stamped and all. \n\nThrough I went to meet back\
  \ up with my sleeper bus. It looked homely and reassuring. A surprising constant\
  \ amidst the anxiety of bribing my way into another country. Before getting back\
  \ on I knew I would appreciate every clammy moment on that bus, every brazen sound\
  \ of its horn, and every pot hole in the road. Anything would be better than the\
  \ fear of being left behind at the border."
