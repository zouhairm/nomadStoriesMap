Text: "My Participation Medal: An Icelandic New Year\u2019s Eve\n\nEveryone knows\
  \ of the Lunar New Year, Chinese New Year - this is such a large celebration that\
  \ is widely celebrated in countries other than China. Iceland is not a country I\
  \ would associate with an extravagant and bold New Year\u2019s celebration. For\
  \ me, it was the perfect place to welcome 2017, but going in, I had no idea it would\
  \ be. After sharing my annual Christmas traditions with my family, I flew to Reykjavik\
  \ with a well planned itinerary and open mind. I found myself standing in the midst\
  \ of all the same elements I\u2019d find in my east coast Canadian province, and\
  \ this provided me with a great sense of comfort. I see lots of ice, rocks and water\
  \ where I reside, but Iceland took these elements and painted them in a way I\u2019\
  d never seen before. I was Snow White, with my black hair curly as can be, and princess\
  \ gown with thermal wear underneath. I stood within the Harpa Concert Hall, donned\
  \ in my costume as everyone else, preparing for the annual New Year\u2019s Eve race.\
  \ The light shone through the glass panels in the walls, displaying a ray of purple\
  \ and the phenomenal piece of architecture it is. As I ran through the race outside,\
  \ I captured the sights - the brilliant costumes, the waterfront and the sun voyageur\
  \ that sits by it. The Sun Voyageur is a site many tourists strive to see; it sits\
  \ atop a large floored section near the waterfront. It is very beautiful, I wanted\
  \ to go closer as many do, and within seconds, I slid! The dusting of snow, the\
  \ moisture and any hint of water on the flooring makes it a hazardous rink. I caught\
  \ my balance and stood back to admire this sculpture of meaning and promise to Iceland.\
  \ The day went on continuing to bring forth many moments of awe, laughter and peace\
  \ as 2017 drew near. Here in Canada, we have \u2018Royal Canadian Air Farce\u2019\
  , as a televised dig at Canadian politics and current events. Iceland has their\
  \ own version, but it only airs once a year, and that would be New Year\u2019s Eve.\
  \ This is an Icelandic tradition to watch this after a feast. And so I did just\
  \ that with the family I lodged with. They explained in English what was happening\
  \ in the program, and we shared many great laughs prior to the bonfires. The bonfires\
  \ are probably the most significant event in an Icelandic New Year\u2019s Eve, these\
  \ and the fireworks! The fireworks begin weeks prior and increase as time goes on,\
  \ or so it seems! The bonfires happen in town and also throughout every neighbourhood,\
  \ such as the one I stayed in. Some bring kitchen chairs, old papers or clothing\
  \ etc. These bonfires (which are largest I\u2019ve ever seen) symbolize moving on\
  \ from the past into the New Year, welcoming a brand new year and all it has to\
  \ bring. There is a distinct reason Icelandic tourism has skyrocketed, and it is\
  \ made up of several other reasons and moments. My moment as a princess on an outdoor\
  \ track brought forth numerous defining moments that began with my journey for a\
  \ participation medal."
