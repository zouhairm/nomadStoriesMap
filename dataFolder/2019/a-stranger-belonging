Text: "The Outback of Australia is more than just cork hats and kangaroos. In fact,\
  \ it holds a secret that nobody can ever prepare you for. Since my return I have\
  \ often expressed my love for the divinity of the vast landscapes, but no description\
  \ will ever quite capture it properly.\nA crucial pulse in this lifeblood of the\
  \ Outback is the inhabitants of its testing terrain. The Aboriginal Communities\
  \ of Australia. We had met a few people from this culture earlier in our trip, however,\
  \ they were accustomed to the civilised areas of places like Darwin and were not\
  \ calling the harsh sands, home. \nIt had been a dark and muggy early morning but\
  \ true to the Aussie form, it bled into a bright and blue skied, hot afternoon.\
  \ The promise of experiencing the bush awaited us and we were welcomed into a small\
  \ community of Aboriginal people. Beautiful yet scarred history embodied in the\
  \ talented men and women who sat undisturbed in the grass and red dust. We were\
  \ truly in the presence of authentic storytellers. \nTheir raw hands and deep eyes\
  \ set them aside from any other person we had met until this point. Their purpose\
  \ was so simple and great, they told their story and survived through the gravitational\
  \ force of those narratives. Tourists, travellers and explorers crave the colours\
  \ that illustrate the stories of their past. In the literal sense, it seemed we\
  \ had found the perfect opportunity to purchase the traditional Aboriginal artwork\
  \ that these women had painted. It was noted that it would be prudent to buy the\
  \ work in front of us; roughly cut items, sprawled across stained pieces of cloth\
  \ on the ground, garnished with ash from the fires being tended by elders. This\
  \ was instead of choosing one of the copious pieces that were hung up in gift shops\
  \ along the way. This way we could be assured our money would go directly to the\
  \ communities. This made the pieces far attractive.\nIt felt oddly honouring to\
  \ be granted permission to speak to these women and to browse their work, to learn\
  \ the stories each piece was telling. We were careful to maintain a high level of\
  \ respect and appreciate their way of life. \nTo continue our lessons of tradition,\
  \ we were tasked with learning the correct way to throw a boomerang. Slightly out\
  \ of character to our surroundings, we were aiming at a foam, yellow, kangaroo \u2018\
  target.\u2019 I had not expected to see such a contemporary item in this place.\
  \ We were to be coached by an Aboriginal man. He was gentle in his movements, focussed\
  \ and generous. His dry, broken heels were well accustomed to the ground that was\
  \ wholly foreign to us. Whereas we swatted flies and wore clothing to protect us\
  \ from their incessant presence, he graciously accepted their right to be with us.\
  \ His minimal and traditional attire, old and well worn. His love of the ground\
  \ where he stood. He belonged there. \nThe following moments will remain engrained\
  \ in my memory forever. We took turns to try and hit the target. I watched from\
  \ the side as our teacher patiently walked back and forth to the grasses to collect\
  \ our lost boomerangs. His face serene and accepting. There was little speech from\
  \ him, only slight, familiar discussion between him and our guide. We continued\
  \ to miss our target. Then, one of our group released the boomerang and it effortlessly\
  \ swiped the top of the Kangaroo\u2019s head. Rapturous applause came from our group.\
  \ At this moment, I saw our teacher, his face broken into full glee. He rocked happily\
  \ on his legs and clapped with the most beautiful smile of pure pride on his face.\
  \ That momentary demeanour, of true happiness. He was so happy for our friend and\
  \ his success which could easily have been overlooked. It was an emotion stemmed\
  \ from parting knowledge. I felt privileged to have looked over at that moment.\
  \ To have seen two generations and two histories combine, if only for a moment."
