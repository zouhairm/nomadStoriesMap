Text: "Sitting in an airplane, I could not believe that it was happening to me. I\
  \ was always dreaming of going to the United States, but I could never imagine that\
  \ I would be lucky to go there in my twentieth. I was travelling alone, a young\
  \ Russian student, a finalist of a contest that gave me that priceless opportunity\
  \ to jump out of my comfort zone and to dive deep into a completely different world.\
  \ \nWhat did I expect from that journey? It is hard to say. But this journey definitely\
  \ turned my life perception upside down. And it was my newly-found friend Harb,\
  \ who was the reason for such a great change.\nI have almost never thought about\
  \ how people of different religions view each other. I believe it is a great treasure\
  \ that there are so many nationalities, ethnicities and religions in the world.\
  \ How can anybody say that one person is better than another because of his or her\
  \ religion or any other aspect?\nHarb is a exchange student from Lebanon. Never\
  \ in my life have I met such a kind and sincere person as she is. She made my journey\
  \ so special: she taught me how to cook traditional Lebanese \u201Ctabuli\u201D\
  \ and explained me a lot of interesting aspects of wearing a scarf. Harb also told\
  \ me many awful things about the attitude of some people to Muslims. I saw how hard\
  \ it was for her to accept the fact that that was our reality. There was one day,\
  \ when she was not leaving her apartments for the whole day. As she said, it was\
  \ \u201CPunish a Muslim day\u201D. Although it was originally held in England, not\
  \ in America, her family back in Lebanon was worried, so Harb promised them not\
  \ to leave her room that day. I spend that day with her, and I could not believe\
  \ that such barbaric and cowardly acts happened nowadays.\nAmerica made a great\
  \ impression on me. However, the greatest impression was made by a young and strong\
  \ Lebanese woman, who believes fervently in her ideals of world peace and kindness."
