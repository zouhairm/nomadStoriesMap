Text: "I met her at the airport on my way to my first international trip on my own.\
  \ I remember feeling very anxious while I waited on the line for the flight to be\
  \ called. Hands shaking as I held my tickets. Then I felt a presence. Her energy\
  \ helped me calm down almost instantly.\n\nYou know, she's Sagittarian, a born traveler.\
  \ I am a Sagittarian too, but before her, I have never felt like I owned the features\
  \ from the zodiac sign I belong. I don't have a huge collection of countries or\
  \ cities I've been and I'm not always planning my next trip.\n\nNowadays I'm aware\
  \ our solar sign, the one we discover firstly, just with our date of birth, is not\
  \ the only thing that defines us astrologically speaking. I also know the Sagittarius\
  \ sign involves much more than the fact of being a good traveler. But took me time,\
  \ and she, this person I had just met, ended up playing an important role in the\
  \ process.\n\nLucky me she was going to the same place I was. She is from there\
  \ actually. It's funny because when I decided to go on this travel experience the\
  \ only thing expected was to make a deep local connection, meet a cool person who\
  \ could show me around. And I did.\n\nWith her I was able to experience things that\
  \ helped me learn more about myself and develop the virtues I was supposed to, just\
  \ by staying connected to each other, by the connections we made together or through\
  \ the places we visited. So familiar with everything, she even gave me a physical\
  \ map and made me carry it around to help me locate myself more easily.\n\nOne time\
  \ we decided to go together to Peru. The plan was to reach Cuzco by the end of the\
  \ day, but we missed our last flight and we could only take a new one in the morning\
  \ after, which meant we would have to stay at the airport a few hours.\n\nI probably\
  \ would have cried if I was on my own. I was so tired. But as we sat on the floor\
  \ next to Starbucks so we could reach the Wi-Fi, somehow I knew everything would\
  \ be ok. I was right.\n\nShe's very wise, you know. It's a shame you can't really\
  \ talk to her. She, or my inner self, as I prefer calling her, despite being Sagittarian,\
  \ is a very private person. I'm the only person able to get in touch. Thank the\
  \ universe she insisted on that map because I did learn how to locate myself so\
  \ I can find her. Thank the universe I was also awake enough to feel her presence\
  \ back then and we headed to the same way. We've been heading the same way ever\
  \ since.\n\nAs you can see, traveling within is no different and no less from traveling\
  \ abroad. Better yet when they go together, because these two types of traveling\
  \ complement each other beautifully. \"Travelling is not exactly about the places\
  \ we visit, but the new person we become when we return\", once wrote M\xF4nica\
  \ Barroso, a Brazilian life and career coach.\n\nIn the end, I qualify for the Sagittarian\
  \ title as well, because it can be true we Sagittarians like to travel around, but\
  \ our philosophical personalities, intellectual curiosity, and mystic side sometimes\
  \ lead us to a different kind of traveling. And as one of my favorites astrologers\
  \ always says, \"the journey starts within.\" What is your inner self telling you\
  \ today? Where do you want to go next? Never forget we are a living map and there's\
  \ always room for a new expedition.\n\nPS: You see, I've been seeing Portugal everywhere\
  \ lately and each time I do my heart beats differently. Knowing about this contest\
  \ could be just a coincide for the ones who wanna call it that way, but now you\
  \ know I'm a mystic person, and writing those words felt like the right thing to\
  \ do, so I prefer calling synchronicity. May the odds be in my favor."
