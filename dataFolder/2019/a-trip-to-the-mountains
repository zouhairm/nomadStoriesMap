Text: "\"It will all make sense one day.\"\nThese are the last words I can remember\
  \ echoing through the chambers of the hallway between my ex boss and my office as\
  \ I left.\nI had just quit my job and had no idea where I was going next or who\
  \ I was going to go with. As my hand pulled at the handle of the building I had\
  \ called home for the last time it suddenly hit me. I needed to escape. To the mountains.\
  \ Now. \nI sped home, packed enough clothes and food for a week into an old rucksack\
  \ and headed to the Berg. Defiance. Freedom. Air. I wanted it all.\nSo I drove North.\
  \ The uneven tar of a road I had traveled many times rocked the sun's glare into\
  \ my face, a light I had forgotten existed in the cold conundrum I called \"living.\"\
  \ Pink and white Cosmos stood shoulder high on the road's edge,  parading and dancing\
  \ in the wind as if to welcome this new found explorer into a world reinvented on\
  \ a whim. \nI reached Try-me rock ( a name given to it by the owners of the farm\
  \ I was squatting on) at 6pm, greeted by the dust of the day. \nIt was a giant of\
  \ a boulder, split over millennia into a overhanging cave with a view you could\
  \ not buy with a king's fortune. For hundreds of kilometres a sea of green veld\
  \ blanketed the land, interrupted only by the inconvenience of a small crevice or\
  \ ravine. A small herd of cattle tarnished the canvas to the right with dashes of\
  \ brown and white and black. \nA lone figure on a horse tending to that herd signaled\
  \ the only presence of a fellow human.\nSummer lent me an hour to tend to my bedding\
  \ and fire, a blaze most welcome with the cool breeze I expected so high up. \n\
  I had not planned to forage much aside from gathering firewood and collecting water\
  \ from the nearby spring so I dug into my rations and produced a tin of baked beans\
  \ for dinner. The nearby long grass I wandered through while collecting firewood\
  \ would make do as bedding for the night. \n\nA modest life for this new explorer\
  \ I muttered to myself. A field mice entered my cave, his high pitched call announcing\
  \ his fragile existence.  I obliged with two baked beans, more than enough for his\
  \ tribe. I am not sure if it was the smell of the camphor burning or the sound of\
  \ nightfall emerging, but a sense of freedom and peace overcame me, rolling through\
  \ my body. Not instantly, no. A subtle sensation, much like a slow acting painkiller.\
  \ \n\nIt was then, as I settled into my makeshift nest, that I spotted something\
  \ in the cave. \nAt first I thought it was the shadows of the furnace playing tricks\
  \ with my already fragile mind, but upon further inspection I noticed that when\
  \ the fire moved, the images remained.  Due to the absence of light, the images\
  \ were hard to decipher.  I grabbed a burning length of tinder and crawled to the\
  \ illustrations in question. Small black stick-like figures danced on the the rough\
  \ peachy exterior of the rock face. Some were gathered around an animal with a fat\
  \ belly and long horns and some were seated in a circular set up, perhaps a family?\n\
  And then, as my eyes drifted to the right taking in the images I saw it.\n\nSix\
  \ figures, all holding what looked like spears stood in a line. Below them a line\
  \ of red clearly marked the ground below them. ( The soil around Try-me is dark\
  \ red.) \nAbout 4 inches above the men was a yellow object with several sticks pointing\
  \ in all directions. A single line, also in yellow had been drawn from the yellow\
  \ orb down towards the men.  \nTo the right of the men stood another figure, twice\
  \ as tall as the six men, with a much bigger head and two dark eyes. \nAt that very\
  \ moment, in that lonesome place inside the cave, I realized that I had stumbled\
  \ upon an ancient account of an extra-ordinary event."
