Text: "Manisha applied thick kohl eyeliner with elegant precision as she squinted\
  \ at the grimy mirror above the sink. Patting down her colourful sari she reached\
  \ into her makeup bag and took out a packet of elaborate bindis. She offered us\
  \ one each, cocking her head playfully to the side.  \n\n\u2018Jaanu?\u2019 Let\u2019\
  s go.\n\nWe swayed into the dark alleyway, a little unsteady in our high heels.\
  \ Manisha took the lead, guiding us through the twists and turns of the dimly lit\
  \ lanes. The night bore down on us, full of the promise of the unknown, the forbidden.\
  \ For what may be obscured during the brightness of day is free to play in the shadowy\
  \ night. \n\nWith a final turn we emerged and were thrust onto a street thronging\
  \ with people and motorbikes. Neon lights blinkered down on Kathmandu\u2019s inhabitants\
  \ as they hurriedly went about their lives, oblivious to the secrets hidden underneath\
  \ Manisha\u2019s mask. With a flick of her wrist Manisha hailed us a cab and we\
  \ were momentarily cocooned from the outside world yet again.\n\nMy friend and I\
  \ concertinaed our saris into the backseat and as Manisha reeled of the name and\
  \ location of the nightclub we were heading for. The rapid-fire conversation coming\
  \ from the front seat was in Nepali, so we were mainly clueless to the negotiations\
  \ and flirtations going on. However out of the corner of my eye I spotted Manisha\u2019\
  s hand reach over and rest suggestively in the drivers lap. I nudged my friend next\
  \ to me.\n\nTransgender, gay, cross dressers, drag queens \u2013 these were not\
  \ words synonymous with the Nepali language. Locally the gay scene was referred\
  \ to as \u2018MSM\u2019 or men who have sex with other men. Within this terminology\
  \ the men are either \u2018ta\u2019 or \u2018meti\u2019 \u2013 roughly translated\
  \ in English as masculine or feminine. Ta\u2019s are \u2018straight\u2019 and hyper\
  \ masculine \u2013 soldiers, police offices, manual labourers; and almost certainly\
  \ married. Meti\u2019s are submissive with feminine traits, yet still expected to\
  \ marry women.\n\nWe reached a dark dirt road next to a rundown building somewhere\
  \ in Kathmandu\u2019s suburbs. It was far removed from the gaudy yet comforting\
  \ tourist district of Thamel that my friend and I had been exploring for the last\
  \ 2 months. Manisha turned to us and indicated that we should get out and wait for\
  \ her. The tiny Maruti taxi lingered for a moment then lurched forward and turned\
  \ around a corner. There was no question in our minds as to what was going in the\
  \ front seat of that taxi.\n\nWe had met Manish a few weeks before. Out of drag,\
  \ Manish was serious and dedicated to his job as a counsellor at the LGBTIQ centre.\
  \ Manisha however was mesmerising \u2013 enigmatic, mysterious and able to command\
  \ the attention of everyone in her vicinity.\n\nManish identified as gay and was\
  \ not overtly feminine. He wasn\u2019t trans and didn\u2019t have a burning desire\
  \ to dress in drag. This was unlike many of his friends, who asked us in fevered\
  \ whispers if it was true that in Western countries people underwent surgery and\
  \ were able to take hormones. Was it true, they asked, that if they took whole packets\
  \ of the contraceptive pill that they would be able to grow breasts?\n\nManish performed\
  \ this role as a meti so that he could go out and meet men and be accepted, if only\
  \ for a brief moment, in Nepali society. At the time his confession was startling\
  \ to me. But maybe we are all cross dressers \u2013 as we try on different identities\
  \ throughout our lives and discard other pieces of ourselves. We were the ones with\
  \ a limited view \u2013 that dressing in drag meant someone wanted to be a woman\
  \ or was somehow gender fluid. No, Manisha was simply a part of Manish, a character\
  \ he played and a mask he wore when he felt like entering a certain world. \n\n\
  Within minutes Manisha was back, striding triumphantly around the corner and out\
  \ of the shadows. We waited for her patiently outside the entrance of the nightclub,\
  \ letting the throbbing music pulse through our bodies.\n\nWith a wobble of her\
  \ head she uttered one word. \n\n\u2018Jannu\u2019. And we followed her across the\
  \ threshold eagerly."
