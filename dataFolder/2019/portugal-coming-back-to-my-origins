Text: "To all Brazilians who wish to know Europe without leaving the comfort of their\
  \ homes, it is a brilliant idea to have as destiny Portugal. Starting with the language,\
  \ of course gifted with its melody feature, there is a lot of familiarities to be\
  \ explored in every corner of this beautiful country. We can identify similarities\
  \ in buildings, houses and also in the architecture.  It's possible to recognize\
  \ little pieces of S\xE3o Paulo there, Rio de Janeiro also, and even Bahia. It is\
  \ wonderful  to walk every for each city place and discover our origins. It is as\
  \ if in a secondary way we belong to that peculiar place. From my brief visit during\
  \ the winter of 2016, I remember all details. Aromas, colors, sounds ... the sublime\
  \ flavor of cod and also the famous pastels of Nata ...\nI remember the wind of\
  \ Lisbon, whose strength had broken my fragile parasol, and it seemed that with\
  \ his strength he would be able to carry me during the walk to the Belem's tower,\
  \ which is situated on the banks of the Tejo's river. The memories of the train's\
  \ trip to Cascais, through which you can see the sea during part of the journey.\
  \ The noise of the unrelenting rain that had fallen upon my arrival in the small\
  \ town, but which had in no way overshadowed its maritime charm and its simplicity.\n\
  The brief passage through the dizzying city of Porto, where melancholy was transformed\
  \ into Fado, so sublime and nostalgic that it took my chest of emotion ... The Church\
  \ of San Francisco, whose interior was clothed with pure gold, had given me a vision\
  \ that would delighted my eyes and my soul deeply, leading me to tears ... The cellars\
  \ and their famous Wines and its peculiarities .... I remember that I almost staggered\
  \ after tasting so many and diverse wines , because it is unusual to me drink a\
  \ lot... But nothing is so incredible as getting drunk on Port wine, in Porto itself,\
  \ listening in Portuguese accent, the history of the rivalry between this and the\
  \ city of Lisbon, told by the Tourist guide.\nI can still remember my brief passage\
  \ through Aveiro, whose canals, to which the Portuguese call \"rias\", resemble\
  \ those of Venice .... What a charming little town. Before I said good-bye, I delighted\
  \ myself, as it could not be different, with the famous soft eggs, the wonderful\
  \ delicacy of the city.\nFrom these experiences that I will always carry in my heart,\
  \ I can certainly say: to all Brazilians who wish to return to their origins without\
  \ having to make \"Time's trip\", Portugal is, with no doubt, the perfect destination.\
  \ Let yourself be snatched away by the familiar charms of this country, which I\
  \ would call almost a second dwelling on the other side of the Atlantic Ocean."
