Text: "There are still a few minutes left in the episode and although it is late,\
  \ I feel compelled to get out of bed. I take my headphones off and stand up, angry.\
  \ I\u2019m trying to quit the habit, but I need a cigarette. \"All of those people\
  \ are probably dead,\u201D I say to myself. Still, I feel rage. Taking pride in\
  \ my capacity to remain stoic, I attempt to quiet myself. Then, without a warning\
  \ and for the first time in months, I start sobbing.\nThe sun was setting fast on\
  \ a cool summer evening in Germany. I looked left and then right. It was almost\
  \ like a maze. I turned a corner and saw a little boy dash around one of the pillars,\
  \ playing a mini game of hide-and-seek with his companions. The dark irony is that\
  \ the very place where the boy hid represents the deaths of people who had nowhere\
  \ to hide.  I looked at my friend Hans. His bleached blonde hair and blue eyes contrasted\
  \ with my dark complexion, no doubt inherited from my Mexican father. Looking at\
  \ the two of us together, you never would have guessed we were first cousins.\n\
  \ \u201CYou\u2019ve been here before?\u201D I asked. \nHe replied, \u201CYeah, we\
  \ visited when we lived here.\u201D  We walked all the way to the end of the memorial\
  \ and turned around. Local visitors and tourists were starting to walk back towards\
  \ Berlin\u2019s city center as night quickly fell.\nPrior to my senior year of high\
  \ school, I had never met a Jewish person. Six years later, the first Jewish person\
  \ I ever met was still one of my greatest friends. As I stood at the Memorial to\
  \ the Murdered Jews of Europe, I could not help but to think of my friend Ben and\
  \ his family. Growing up in the American Midwest, I thought about my own place in\
  \ history as a minority and the prejudice I had experienced. I realized just how\
  \ easy my life had been until then. I felt a surge of gratitude towards the heavens.\n\
  \ \u201CYou ready?\u201D asked Hans. I smiled softly and nodded.\nAs I stand on\
  \ my balcony, I find myself asking \u201CWhy?\u201D to no one in particular. After\
  \ a few stormy minutes, I breathe deeply and feel a secure sense of calm wash over\
  \ me. I wipe my face dry and close my eyes, thinking of the time I spent visiting\
  \ Germany. In the moment, the hallowed ground I travelled thousands of miles to\
  \ stand upon still speaks its truth to me.\n I return to the comfort of my bed to\
  \ finish \u201CWhy We Fight\u201D, the 9th Band of Brothers episode, to see how\
  \ those U.S. soldiers contend with liberating the Dachau concentration camp. As\
  \ the episode finishes, I marvel at the complexity of humans. In each of us there\
  \ exists a seemingly limitless ability to create, to save, to destroy. Wherever\
  \ we go, whenever we travel, history is whispering its lessons to us. Whether at\
  \ home or abroad, and as painful as it may be, we should consider the importance\
  \ of giving time to think about those that came before us. We should contemplate\
  \ deeply about our option to listen to them and most of all, to learn."
