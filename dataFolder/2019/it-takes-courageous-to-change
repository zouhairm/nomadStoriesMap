Text: "My journey begins in the place, perhaps, most important and unknown of all,\
  \ the dream world that lives within each one of us. Five years ago I left a very\
  \ successful career as a lawyer and decided to go back to university. I decided\
  \ to study journalism and seek new opportunities outside Brazil, where I live.\n\
  The courage to change came definitely after the heart surgery my husband had to\
  \ do. The certainty that life is very brief and that the world is very big has taken\
  \ care of us and also of our two children.\nIn 2017 I was approved to study Communication\
  \ at the University of Porto and we moved. The four, towards the complete unknown.\
  \ We had never even visited Portugal, we did not know what it would be like to change\
  \ with the whole family. How would it be the children's school, the food, the medical\
  \ care, in short, the resumption in another country.\nI still remember the breathtaking\
  \ sensation when, in the early days, the subway went out to the surface and I saw\
  \ the sky reflected in the waters of the Douro that mirrored the colors of Ribeira\
  \ on one side and Gaia on the other. After that moment, I was never the same.\n\
  We were taken in love by Portugal, especially by Porto. It was incredibly remarkable\
  \ to know the old chain of redemption, today, Portuguese Center of Photography and\
  \ to witness how man is, at the same time, able in the same physical space, but\
  \ in different times, to share prison and freedom. Before the place imprisoned people,\
  \ today, it opens the horizons with the diverse cultural expositions.\nThe church\
  \ of Lapa is another impossible place not to excite us. It is there that the heart\
  \ of D.Pedro IV of Portugal and I of Brazil is. And about that there is even a movie,\
  \ but it is good to say, it is not anyone who can have access to the place where\
  \ our affections live, because it is stored with seven keys, as a Brazilian musician\
  \ already sang.\nSurprises do not stop there. Two cemeteries that are part of the\
  \ European Cultural Routes of Cemeteries remain in Porto. The places where great\
  \ Portuguese personalities such as Camilo Castelo Branco, Jos\xE9 Ferreira Borges\
  \ and others rest, are considered historical cultural heritages of Europe. And in\
  \ both places there are guided visits with specialists in architecture and arts,\
  \ as well as musical concerts or literary events. All for free.\nJust a few kilometers\
  \ away, along the wide and well-cared roads, you will soon arrive in Guimar\xE3\
  es, the birthplace of Portugal, where King Dom Henrique was born and triumphed.\
  \ It was him who made those lands, says the history, the country we know today.\
  \ The visit to the castle is a wonderful immersion into the past. But it is possible\
  \ to go even further in time, for this, we only have to go a few more kilometers\
  \ and get to Coimbra. No library can be more shocking than the Joanina. To look\
  \ up and see on the ceiling the painting of four women representing the four continents\
  \ known at that time is a dazzle, not forgetting the gold and shine all over. And\
  \ there is so much more to be seen! \nThe leap into the unknown seems to have brought\
  \ me back. The smells, the flavors, the fresh breeze and the pulsation of so much\
  \ history impregnated in each hillside, in every monument, in every corner of the\
  \ city of Porto made me sure that my place is there. We are back in Brazil, but\
  \ in Portugal is where I want to be."
