Text: "Traveling alone to the Amazon with clinical depression wasn't easy.\n\nI taught\
  \ English abroad in Quito for a year and during one of the breaks, I bought an impromptu\
  \ 3-day trip to the Amazon. I rode in a shuttle for 10 hours through the night,\
  \ another bus for two hours and a canoe for two more to the inner rainforest. I\
  \ threw up pizza along the way from the motion sickness, but that's neither here\
  \ nor there. The whole time my fearful thoughts about street robbers and social\
  \ anxieties about speaking Spanish took over, but I wanted to challenge myself to\
  \ get out of my comfort zone. \n\nAfter the voyage ended, I met up with a group\
  \ of strangers to our site called Guacamayo (Macaw). \n\nThe group of international\
  \ travelers and I had no access to cellphone reception, warm showers, wifi or electricity.\
  \ We did, however, have access to seeing toucans, pink dolphins, alligators, night\
  \ lobsters, glow-in-the-dark trees, and more geographical wonders. \n\nI slept alone\
  \ in a bunk bed covered in a mosquito net in a wooden lodge. Nothing like seeing\
  \ a giant moth waiting for you in the bathroom or critters crawling around at bedtime.\
  \ The sounds of thousands of bugs and birds at night were terrifying, yet awakening\
  \ on a deeper level. Indigenous peoples have found ways to survive in the Amazon\
  \ on a daily basis while most of the world enjoys the comforts and luxuries of urban\
  \ civilization. \n\nEvery meal at the dinner table delighted me with dishes of plantains,\
  \ native fishes, and tropical fruits. The conversations with other travelers from\
  \ Denmark, the Netherlands, Australia, and Germany included topics of politics and\
  \ travel adventures. (I was grateful they spoke English most of the time but embarrassed\
  \ because my Spanish needed improvement.)\n\nThe outdoors and lack of technology\
  \ provided me with feelings of wonder and curiosity. Adventure and adrenaline washed\
  \ over me. We took daily canoe rides, and I did my best to avoid smacking my neighbor\
  \ with an oar. The canoe was narrow and small like the staircase that you pull down\
  \ to go up an attic. \n\nWe rode into an underwater forest with tree trunks that\
  \ popped halfway out of the water like stationary buoys. The levels of water change\
  \ during the wet and dry seasons, so everything you see from the monkeys leaping\
  \ in the trees to the snakes in the water change the scenery for everyone and every\
  \ visit. \n\nOur tour guide could call hundreds of types of animals just by changing\
  \ the tones and pitches of his voice \u2014 a handy talent for his livelihood! \n\
  \nAt the end of three days, I left with hundreds of mosquito bites, thousands of\
  \ pictures and a global perspective. With a mental illness as a daily challenge,\
  \ I felt a sense of growth that I had overcome parasitic thoughts during that time\
  \ and welcomed in adventurous ones with new eyes."
