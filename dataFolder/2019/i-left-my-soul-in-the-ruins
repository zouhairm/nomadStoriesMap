Text: "I didn't expect to leave my heart behind... \n\nTraveling through the ruins,\
  \ feeling the power of the souls that once walked these worn roads, history called.\
  \ It beckoned. It called to me like an old lover, a warm drink on a cold day; like\
  \ a hug that envelopes you fully. \nI walked the path of those before me. I became\
  \ a part of the scenery. I felt the pull like a taught string taunting me to stay,\
  \ and to never leave. Athens had taken hold of me and never wanted me to go.\nLike\
  \ all tourists, not knowing that they left their mark on the world once known, I\
  \ wandered with an aimlessness. My mouth agape and my soul absorbing every inch\
  \ of a country that birthed so many after. Not knowing that Athens had affected\
  \ me from the moment I set foot on its soil, my heart was forever changed by the\
  \ past. I crept through the ruins, past the shops with their multitude of smells\
  \ and sights, all the while thinking of all those that had come before me. Listening\
  \ to the echoes of a time once teeming with philosophers, mathematicians, artists\
  \ and scholars, the moment surrounded me with joyous arms. Athens was glad I came.\
  \ \nThis city with its modern adornments was excited to showcase its rich history\
  \ with a new visitor. Sure, I took the shimmering new rail from the airport to the\
  \ ancient section of the city, but it was a contradiction to the power felt by the\
  \ past. History out weighed the modern. Or so I thought. Surprised to find that\
  \ the modern and the ancient shared this city, I knew I had to immerse myself. \n\
  With a book in hand, sitting in the ruins of the Four Winds temple, I read the words\
  \ of another as he recounted. As if he were a man of that time, once long ago, when\
  \ Alexander the Great's father was schooled here, his words moved me to explore.\
  \ To venture outside of my comfort zone. To tell others of the draw this ancient\
  \ city has to one's soul.  \nTo explain it, there's a calm centre to its charm,\
  \ something that can't be explained or bottled. Visiting a statue here, enjoying\
  \ a thick rich Greek coffee there, all the while you wonder why you'd never been\
  \ before? \nWhy had it taken me so long to visit? \nWhy had others not felt this\
  \ pull too? \nI hadn't intended on coming here, but I never expected I wouldn't\
  \ want to go home. Like all vacations, you anticipate the arrival and hate the return,\
  \ though this was different. This country had evoked a need to stay. It had pulled\
  \ me in, making me feel that I never wanted to leave. So I took it all in, daring\
  \ myself to miss nothing. There was something for everyone, and at any hour it seemed.\
  \ \nTaking in the nightlife, there was a mix for all ages. Seeing parents with strollers\
  \ and young children filling the streets after dark, or late night revellers and\
  \ older families having dinner at the vivacious restaurants, it felt oddly traditional.\
  \ The daytime was reserved for the tourists, while in the glow of the lit Acropolis\
  \ the city bustled with its native inhabitants. I was enthralled and sad to go when\
  \ my time was up.  \nReturning home, with the vacation ended and the memory of Athens\
  \ a distant dream, I felt adrift. I had left a piece of myself behind. \nDid I really\
  \ intend on leaving intact? No. I suspect I didn't. Though no other country has\
  \ sucked me in quite the way that Athens, Greece had. It had welcomed me with open\
  \ arms, both the people and the culture, so that if and when I returned I knew that\
  \ I'd be accepted. Like a returned conquerer, I could come home at anytime and feel\
  \ as if I'd never left. \nA part of me will remain, to entice the next soul to feel\
  \ the history of this city, to show others the way. \nDon't wander through life\
  \ whole and never experiencing Athens. Leave a portion behind to be explored by\
  \ the next happy adventurer, like I did."
