Text: "It was another wonderful morning on Banyardala street, Yangon. I woke up at\
  \ six, which was earlier than anyone else in the flat so I could have enough time\
  \ to enjoy showering without anyone knocking on the door asking who was inside.\
  \ But most importantly, I wanted to have peaceful moments on the balcony drinking\
  \ milk and eating bread with peanut butter, watching the birds flying in front of\_\
  me, reading a book that I brought from Vietnam and then, writing. I did not know\
  \ what to write about but I just wanted to keep my hand moving to inspire and be\
  \ inspired, to love and be loved. I loved writing, that was why.\n\nThat day, I\
  \ wrote about happiness. Because after all, I was happy. Marco asked me the night\
  \ before, \"Are you happy?\" \"YES!\" replied I. To be honest, a simple \"yes\"\
  \ could not express how happy I felt. I was trying to find the right words but I\
  \ simply could not. That happiness was too great to describe. Or to be exact, you\
  \ could never describe any kind of happiness. You could just feel it. \n\nBut, let's\
  \ imagine this way! There was a bird who had been stuck on the ground for so long.\
  \ She wondered where she should go, which way she should take and where her home\
  \ truly was. All of a sudden, she just spread her wings and flew into the beautiful\
  \ sky. She just wanted to start a new journey without planning any destinations.\
  \ \n\nBefore, she was in an identity crisis struggling with herself. Was she from\
  \ the East or the West? Or was she such a messy mixture of those two? Why all she\
  \ ever wanted was to move while people already settled down? Was she going against\
  \ traditional values? Was she doing it right? Hundreds of questions were driving\
  \ her insane. However, since the very first start of that new chapter, she realized\
  \ that she was doing right. Her heart was beating faster and faster because of excitement.\
  \ The sky was her home, her life, and what she wanted. She was a bird, and hence\
  \ she had the right to fly. There might be a mess inside her but it was a lovely\
  \ and beautiful mess. People might need a certain place and be surrounded by certain\
  \ people to feel safe but she was flexible, she could feel like home everywhere\
  \ she went. It was okay to be homeless sometimes because she, herself, with all\
  \ the strengths and weaknesses, positivity and negativity, was home. She was extremely\
  \ happy as long as she could be herself no matter how wild it could be.\n\nIf you\
  \ changed the subject \u201Ca bird\u201D into an \u201CI\u201D, then you would know\
  \ my story in Myanmar. Before two months in Myanmar, I had carried the burdensome\
  \ responsibility to take one of two scholarships for master degrees in order to\
  \ meet the expectation from my family. On the other hand, I had always wanted to\
  \ take a new turn to discover myself. I had arrived in Myanmar as a successful scholar\
  \ who participated in a local youth empowerment project, but in the end, I was also\
  \ the one to be empowered.\n\nFrequent trips between cities liberalized me from\
  \ the chain of settling down. Sparkling eyes and smile from the audience in my workshop\
  \ of confidence and passion got me to realize how happy I felt when working on personal\
  \ development. Feedbacks when youngsters read my random notes as workshop materials\
  \ gave me so much hope on becoming a writer. Impacts that I made on the audience\
  \ really blew my mind on how great my capability could be if I left all the doubts\
  \ behind.\n\nConsequently, it was in my third week in Myanmar that it suddenly hit\
  \ my mind hard: I need to do what my heart was telling me to. Then, after finishing\
  \ a piece of handwriting about happiness, I opened my laptop and wrote two refusal\
  \ letters to two postgraduate programs to notify them I did not want to take the\
  \ scholarships. It was an unexpected decision, and so far it has been the greatest\
  \ one I have ever made!"
