Text: "I have been a homebody since my childhood. In spite of it, the love to travel\
  \ have remained deep down in my heart for years. To know the unknown and expect\
  \ the unexpected was my first ever choice. It hasn\u2019t been long enough when\
  \ I chose to took charge and work to cut down every wish I had all along the past\
  \ years. Which eventually took me to Quetta, Pakistan. The way to this city was\
  \ a dream I had for almost 6-7 years which came true on 19th January, 2019.\n\n\
  The craze to see and feel everything was visible through my expressions and intentions.\
  \ I was awake early morning, the gradually rising sun having an effect of rebirth\
  \ and helping me out to recharge myself for the whole day was just enough for the\
  \ start. I made my way to the main door of the bus and the first sight that struck\
  \ my eyes was the greenish meadows of Larkana, Sindh. The dim rays of the Sun staying\
  \ upon those leaves was just mesmerizing to my soul.  As soon as we crossed it we\
  \ were near Jacobabad, Sindh and the last station that lies within Sindh. \n\nAfter\
  \ crossing the border of Balochistan, the sight of houses build with mud and thatched\
  \ roofs was something to ponder over and learn about the culture and lifestyle of\
  \ Balochi people. In between those houses I saw a cotton field for the first time.\
  \ This was light brown in color as someone sees from distance but as the train stopped\
  \ I got to see a closer look. The white colored balls were as if snow falling is\
  \ hanging somewhere between the earth and sky. \nAs we move on we stopped near Sibbi\
  \ Junction, the best place I visited so far, Pehro Kunri. This was the place where\
  \ I exactly found peace, there I found silence, and there I looked for calmness\
  \ and serenity. The light Sun shine and the clear skies after a heavy rain just\
  \ added to the beauty of the place. The visuals I saw back then are a memory to\
  \ cheer and I find it soothing for my inner self every time I go through the pictures.\
  \ \n\nMoor joining to the mountains, and every mountain shaped uniquely and the\
  \ skies shining bright after a heavy rain giving the earthy aroma, the Petrichor\
  \ was mind-boggling. If I could keep something for all my life that would be that\
  \ pleasing fragrance. I kept on examining things closely, and find out a train lever\
  \ and a track-trace. It\u2019s really odd to say but my behavior seeing everything\
  \ for the first time was like moving back into my childhood. Wondering as if I was\
  \ born on that station, feeling everything around me, new and optimistic. I also\
  \ find a mosque in a desolate place like Pehro Kunri, it was resembling the love\
  \ people have with their faith and a symbol for peace by providing a shelter for\
  \ lost.\n\nMoving forward and reaching to Aab-I-Gum was something more eye-opening.\
  \ The purity and the eye-catching beauty, white stunning mountains covered in snow\
  \ and lovely shiny bright light coming through the skies was almost craving for\
  \ more to explore. Seeing this scenery again and again just not helped out to reinvigorate\
  \ but to revitalize for the upcoming travels. I also saw a goat at this station\
  \ and tried to pat him once and offered some fruits I had. \nQuetta was not far\
  \ now but the colder winds were easily felt here and to seek for more until reaching\
  \ Quetta was a wish here too. I met many people during these 20 hour travelling\
  \ and explored about multi-cultures Pakistan has. I can still recall the little\
  \ girl who was wearing a Sindhi Chola at Aab-I-Gum, playing on the bench and trying\
  \ to make fun by getting up and down. \n\nIn the end I would just say that I don\u2019\
  t really know how I will get to travel more with all the stuff I have on pending\
  \ but I know that the only thing a person should have for achieving something is\
  \ will."
