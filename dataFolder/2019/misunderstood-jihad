Text: "Bleeding dawn, mourning was prevalent, living was a surprise to discover. One\
  \ can clearly stipulate the religious beliefs backing this ideology of misunderstood\
  \ 'JIHAD' in Islam, that solidifies as terrorists. \n\nThey spare no one, women,\
  \ men, children. I do not think that this can be ever a religious ideology of any\
  \ religion. \n\nI had interviewed a few Muslims regarding the same: \n\n'Islam praises\
  \ peace, prosperity, and Jihad stipulates a defensive action to protect Islamism.\
  \ Anyone who violates it has no right to claim themselves Muslims, as we talk about\
  \ terrorists in this context, they have no place in Islam' - Aslam said. \n\n'Some\
  \ countries cooks terrorists to disturb the harmony of their rival countries but\
  \ they never know the time comes when their cat will cut their own hand.' - Arif\
  \ said.\n\n'Every difficult and demanding task has to be backed by some motivation\
  \ whether it is right or wrong, same can be seen in the case of terrorism, they\
  \ have been brainwashed with false Islamic extreme thinking from which they all\
  \ get connected and prepare to die for a cause. Now, that we all know that this\
  \ is wrong but one can only know the right or wrong when he/she thinks from their\
  \ brain instead of getting brainwashed from others.' - Prof. Rahman. \n\nPeace can\
  \ only be maintained by harmony in conducts.\n\nI'd saw Muslim community protesting\
  \ against terrorism in the name of Islam, at the same time I'd seen politicians\
  \ manipulating terrorism to their advantage, I'd seen mothers, sisters mourning\
  \ over their young blood loss, and I'd seen terrorists killing people without a\
  \ cause. \n\nThe world will fall short for violence but for peace, we have enough\
  \ people and things to love and live."
