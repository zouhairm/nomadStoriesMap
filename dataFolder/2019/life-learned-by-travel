Text: "Before shouldering any responsibility, I wanted to have sound knowledge backed\
  \ by practical exposure with an MBA. Though university and courses available in\
  \ my city, some better in other parts of India, I decided to go for the best.\n\
  And therefore I landed in Birmingham, UK.\n\nFirst arrival in Birmingham, \nIt was\
  \ late evening when I took a taxi to the BCU campus, more particularly at Curzon\
  \ accommodation. An in-house student working as a part-time employee welcomed me.\
  \ I was mentally and physically feeling jet leg due to nonstop flight journey from\
  \ my home in Vadodara, but the shocked given by desk clerk vapored out the jet leg\
  \ on saying that unless payment received accommodation room not possible. (due to\
  \ their lack of management, payment wasn't received previously). After discussion\
  \ with her and my father at home, she was ready to charge for a week and in due\
  \ course full payment.\n\nThe real shock of the 8.9 Richter scale was on its way.\
  \ Swiping my credit card she entered the entire term payment instead of one week\
  \ due to which my card got blocked for overcharged amount. As office hours were\
  \ about to end, staff started closing down.\n\nUnder a great trauma, seating on\
  \ visitor's bench, trying to find a way out I was blown by another bolt. The clerk\
  \ had gone home with lockers keys, keeping my luggage inside.\n\nIn fact, my journey\
  \ of physical travel ended at Birmingham Airport but my journey of emotions, feelings,\
  \ experiences, and every moment turning situations began with my landing in Birmingham.\n\
  \nA girl who joined the accommodation office today only understood my difficulties\
  \ and offered me shelter for a night. I went to her home barren handed, not even\
  \ having a toothbrush.\n\nToday's episode screened every moment of life.\n\nNext\
  \ day, difficulties started soothing down when dad managed wire transfer, but it\
  \ had shaken my inner-self to think afresh about my new aims,  goals, and perspectives\
  \ about life, people and society. \n\nMy real journey started at that moment.\n\n\
  Along with my IMBA classes, I used to spend 2 hours in the evening as a volunteer\
  \ to serve food to the homeless. I volunteered at Fire Service Station for giving\
  \ safety guidance to small kids of various age group and schools. And also worked\
  \ legally for 20 hours/week in night shifts. I learned a lot from all the 4 places.\
  \ Learned pity conditions of poor, how to re-live childhood by mixing with innocent\
  \ kids, the value of each hard-earned penny and educational knowledge from the university.\n\
  \nWe all, generally believe that journey, travel or voyage means moving a person\
  \ from one place to another, but for me, the meaning is altogether different.  From\
  \ the day of landing in Birmingham I started multiple travels where I came across:\n\
  Good friends and human beings who made me aware of various cultures, languages,\
  \ and customs, \nManagement of time, money and every other thing,\nMy own abilities\
  \ and strengths,\nUnderstanding of different situations and become a positive thinker\
  \ from inside out willingly.\n\n\nAnd I came across the way of living and understanding\
  \ my life with traveling within less than 1 year.\n\n\n\nThank You."
