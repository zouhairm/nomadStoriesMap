Text: "Hey everyone I\u2019m Max a Venezuelan boy who never was out of my country,\
  \ my first trip was for my birthday and I came to Cancun mexico eas my first time\
  \ to see other culture, food colors and people so was a lovely experience, I remember\
  \ my first night just looking around as a idiot listen all the different language\
  \ and accents that was just magical for me principally becouse in Venezuela is not\
  \ very popular for expats to go.\n\nI also meet new friends here and I expend my\
  \ last night with this beautiful Canadian guy who I meet at my hotel! I was just\
  \ in love with me I\u2019m his arms looking he start in the roof listening the ocean\
  \ on the back and just praying to god to stop the time in that night for ever.\n\
  \nFor my luck when I come back to Venezuela I was still in touch with this guys...\
  \ and well let me tell you that now he\u2019s my boyfriend and we are leaving together\
  \ in the same city that we fall in love so... it\u2019s always so many chances to\
  \ meet amazing people and discover beautiful places and cultures that for sure I\u2019\
  ll go somewhere else and look for next adventures and better experience every time."
