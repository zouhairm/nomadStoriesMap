Text: "\u201CIt cannot be\u201D.\nI turned my eyes towards Leo, two rows behind me.\n\
  I wanted to know if he witnessed the event or if even he succeeded in falling asleep,\
  \ in spite of the deafening boom we heard through the broken windows.\nThis time\
  \ he was awake, his eyes were rolling towards mine in the exact moment.\n\u201C\
  It cannot be\u201D I repeated, just to give me the time to elaborate something wittier,\
  \ I guess.\n\nPatience is not a virtue one can lack when embarking in an adventurous\
  \ world road-trip; but this time I could feel a slight tension in our giggles: since\
  \ 24 hours we were jumping on different bus seats to the rhythm of the incredibly\
  \ damaged streets you find between Varanasi, India, and the India Nepal border;\
  \ on the top of that, we were trying to recover from a food poisoning we got a couple\
  \ of days before.\n\nOur latter tiny-and-uncomfortable bus collected a series of\
  \ unfortunate events that in my mind were becoming allegorical: a first flat tyre\
  \ was followed by a small accident with a scooter, then another flat tyre and, finally,\
  \ here comes flat tyre n.3.\nThe other passengers, which were likely way more acquainted\
  \ than us with semi-eternal bus rides, didn\u2019t even bother to make a sound when\
  \ the tyre broke, and they all seemed very relaxed about it: the giant man with\
  \ the traditional Nepalese hat in the row next to mine was still enjoying his 3\
  \ hours-long nap (\u201Chow was he able do that?\u201D), the three-generations-women-only\
  \ family behind was still laughing since the beginning of the trip: almost everybody\
  \ is cheerful and relaxed in Nepal, but we didn\u2019t know it yet.\n\nThis time\
  \ there were no more spare wheels laying beneath the enormous charge of luggages\
  \ on the top of the bus, so the driver and his assistant made some people get off,\
  \ among them, Leo and I. Only when the bus, to our great surprise, went away leaving\
  \ us in the darkness, we understood the meaning of our expulsion: the youngest people\
  \ of the bus had to get off to lighten the bus so it could go back and get the tyre\
  \ changed to the nearest town.\n\nWe found ourselves, tired and heavily underdressed,\
  \ in the middle of the Nepalese highway in a cold December night, without really\
  \ knowing how much we would have waited for the bus to come back and without knowing\
  \ what to do.\nBut a group of Indian lads next to us seemed instead to be prepared\
  \ exactly for this kind of situation: one of them took out from nowhere a big portable\
  \ speaker and started dancing like crazy to an Indian pop song, followed soon by\
  \ all the group.\nAt first I stared, mesmerized by the incredible elastic movement\
  \ of the group and their incredible energy, then I couldn\u2019t help from keeping\
  \ my legs and I start moving as well.\nThis general euforia was soon passed to the\
  \ rest of the group and we ended all dancing in this improbable improvised open-air\
  \ club for a whole hour, until the bus finally came back.\n\nAs we got on the bus,\
  \ which were soon to bring us to our destination, I once again thanked life for\
  \ giving me the opportunity to get lost in the middle of a completely foreign country\
  \ and to find adventure, joy and meaning in there as well."
