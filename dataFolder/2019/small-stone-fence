Text: "It was a sharp, almost stabbing pain. Above the bone but below the skin. Straight\
  \ across my chest, with a slight tingly edge to it. I was sitting on a stone fence\
  \ a few feet off the ground. The air felt different. Everything was a little bit\
  \ more strained, took a little bit more effort. Surrounded by a small group of near\
  \ strangers, I felt shaken, but mostly, I was angry. \n\nI sat 4400 m above sea\
  \ level, surrounded by the serene mountain range of the Himalayas. Several locals\
  \ walked by with yaks carrying supplies up to the northern villages. The mountains\
  \ were beautiful. Beyond that, it felt like they were perfect. Towering all around\
  \ us, but so tranquil, almost elegant. \n\nWe were on day six of our eight-day trek\
  \ to Everest basecamp through Nepal. Beginning of the season, the trails were mostly\
  \ empty. Ten of us in total, we were led by a local entrepreneur, Indra Kemar Rai\
  \ (starting his own hiking tour company after years of working for others) and his\
  \ two close friends Raj and Indra (or as he suggested we call him, India two).\n\
  \nExperienced hikers all around, the three of them noticed on day four that I began\
  \ to exhibit the mild symptoms of altitude sickness. The other hikers and I took\
  \ Diamox at the start of the trek, a medication meant to prevent or decrease the\
  \ effect of altitude sickness. Still, concerned for my wellbeing, Indra insisted\
  \ my body needed more time to acclimatize to the conditions. We waited, and by the\
  \ end of the day, I was steady on my feet, dizziness and nauseousness near gone,\
  \ ready to keep going. \n\nDay six, my body was reacting to the medication, only\
  \ I didn't know that. I had experienced mild tingling from the Diamox before, but\
  \ nothing so intense. I thought I had to stop. Angry and beyond frustrated with\
  \ myself, I didn't want to but had already slowed the group down so much. A group\
  \ of people I barely knew besides Kerry and Crystal. Two dear friends who invited\
  \ us all on this trip as a way to bring their closest friends from across the globe\
  \ together.\n\nIndra sent the others on ahead. Sliding off the wall to the ground\
  \ bracing our backs against the small stone fence, he brought out a first aid book\
  \ and showed me a passage. I was experiencing a side effect from the medication,\
  \ but apparently, it would pass. The sky was calm, clear and so very blue. Again,\
  \ we waited, talking mostly nonsense for a while. Stories of his friendship with\
  \ Kerry and Crystal, how they all met, his love of these treks. I told him more\
  \ about Canada, my home and about everywhere travels had taken me. He looked at\
  \ me at a point, smiled so bright, so honest. He told me he knew this hike was challenging,\
  \ that our safety and wellbeing came first, but he believed I could finish. Ultimately,\
  \ of course, he said the decision was mine, and he would support me in whatever\
  \ that was, everyone would.\n\nThe following days were slow moving, the altitude\
  \ above 5000m only carries about 50% normal oxygen levels. Nothing was rushed. The\
  \ tingles less prominent but slight side effects still there, a few others felt\
  \ some of the impacts as well. We reached basecamp, as a team, at just after 2 pm\
  \ on September 11th, 2015. There were praises, hugs and cheers being passed in every\
  \ direction. Kerry surprised us all by proposing to his long term girlfriend Crystal\
  \ moments after we arrived. More hugs, more cheers. Everything felt worth it. Amongst\
  \ the chaos and excitement, I found Indra to thank him. Everyone was so supportive\
  \ through the whole trip, but Indra got us there, he got me there. I will forever\
  \ be grateful for the kindness he showed me and the friendship we now have."
