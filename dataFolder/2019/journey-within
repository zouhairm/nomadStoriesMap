Text: "Restless amidst the chaos of the never ending stressful, industrious and corporate\
  \ life, craving for more humanly interaction with nature, in quest of tranquility\
  \ and urge to find my true self, above all the expectations of those close to me\
  \ and default standards that fit me into the definition of a successful modest woman\
  \ in the society, I craved for a break. I was lost and was struggling my way to\
  \ find my own self.\n\nAdmirers of the law of nature say that this universe absolutely\
  \ likes speed, so don't delay or have second thoughts! When the impulse is there\
  \ and you can intrinsically and intuitively feel the compulsion from within you,\
  \ hit the road! That's what we ought to do and that's just what I did and ended\
  \ up in the north to witness the autumn of Hunza, known for its beauty and serenity\
  \ at its best! \n\nIt was early in the morning and I headed out for a walk through\
  \ the woods of Hunza, those red and orange leaves, birds chirping, falling berries\
  \ and traditionally clad women adorned with ornaments, carving wood, which would\
  \ very soon be converted into handicrafts and antiques, made me agree to how this\
  \ universe actually does like speed and there is no stopping.\n\nAs I walked through\
  \ the crooked woods, I felt nature was beginning to take over me, the cold breeze,\
  \ the smell of the soil, the feeling of nature, it was as if just as much as I was\
  \ in the quest of peace and figuring out what I really wanted to do in life, who\
  \ I wanted to be, this very place seemed like it was waiting for me to get there\
  \ and feel the tranquility. It was just there and then the the realisation hit me\
  \ hard. Might as well agree with what was penned down in Circa 3000 BC:\n\nAs above,\
  \ so below.\nAs within, So without!\n\nThe force of attraction of my positive feelings\
  \ was indeed channeling more positive vibes from nature to me, and that was the\
  \ moment I lived. It was as if the universe had begun to rearrange itself to make\
  \ it happen. I sat down, I was feeling good and it felt as if I was attracting good\
  \ my way. I felt it and it felt ecstatic. I was finally able to focus. My mind could\
  \ not stop fantasising who I wanted to be: A travel writer; an incurable romantic,\
  \ someone who loved nature, seeing and interacting with people from different backgrounds;\
  \ the inhabitants, someone who could feel the aura, the symphony every place had\
  \ that turned into music if you could feel and feel deeply, to be able to taste\
  \ the foods that had traditions blended with the ingredients, to walk through the\
  \ streets that had witnessed history! Every corner of the world holds a legacy.\
  \ However to find your own self you must find the unknown, and that can be possible\
  \ if you can fantasise and turn your fantasies into the realm of reality, only then\
  \ you're in a position to learn not only about the world around you, but within\
  \ you and beyond. \n\nAnd that my friend, is where I am off to now just as I close\
  \ my eyes again, I am a traveller into my soul ready to take a walk through the\
  \ world, pen down what I witness and photograph what my eyes would behold as my\
  \ memories, perhaps years down the lane, I will be a story teller, because we are\
  \ what we live, and I happen to be a firm believer of living in the present, living\
  \ every moment. That is what cherishes your soul and that is the experience you\
  \ can cherish with others. The revelation hit me hard 'Nothing can come into your\
  \ experience unless you summon it through persistent feelings and thoughts'.\n\n\
  I learnt, all that is to be done is to feel and fantasise. Believe and it'll come\
  \ to you. Live in the moments and let rest be history, to be told as a story. With\
  \ that, I found the unknown. I found myself. I found peace. It is just in being\
  \ who you truly are. Be you, and be bravely!"
