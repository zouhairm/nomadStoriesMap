Text: "Being a woman in this world is not easy. Sure things have changed over the\
  \ years, but it\u2019s still a challenge. As a result, at the age of 22, when I\
  \ lived in the US for a year, I had a hard time adapting to feeling safe, incredibly\
  \ enough. At first, walking the streets of quiet Providence, RI gave me anxiety\
  \ attacks.\nSo, traveling solo seemed a far-fetched possibility. After all, how\
  \ could I, someone who trembled at the idea of taking the bus after sunset, explore\
  \ the world by myself? In spite of that, I decided I wasn\u2019t going to let the\
  \ fear win and limit my freedom of movement. Little by little I started exploring\
  \ my new town by myself and soon I took my first solo steps in other places \u2013\
  \ going to the MET in New York, day-long tours in downtown Mexico City and Havana,\
  \ and even a three-day trip to New Orleans\u2019 carnival celebrations all alone.\
  \ \nHowever, the game changer was definitely my week-long vacation in Montreal.\
  \ None of my friends in the US were able to accompany me, so I had to go by myself.\
  \ The goals of this trip were to explore a new city, try new food and meet new people,\
  \ but also to spend some quality alone time. Don\u2019t get me wrong, I love being\
  \ around people, but every now and then a private journey is necessary and the city\
  \ proved to be a perfect scenario for it. \nMontreal is a vibrant mix of old and\
  \ new. While the Notre-Dame Basilica makes you feel like you are in a past century,\
  \ with its beautiful colorful vaults, while the pubs and restaurants in the Vieux\
  \ Port or Le Vilage blast the trendiest music hits.\nI was lucky enough to visit\
  \ Montreal during its 375th anniversary celebrations. There were events all over\
  \ the city and public transportation was free on May 17th so that everyone could\
  \ join the celebrations. Because of that, I even got to see Justin Trudeau\u2019\
  s speech live at Place d\u2019Armes. \nIf you like nature, the city offers great\
  \ options. Buying just one ticket, you can have access to the Botanical Garden,\
  \ the Insectarium and \u2013 my favorite \u2013 the Biodome, where you can see animals\
  \ from all over the world in the renovated structure of the Olympic Park. Another\
  \ option is visiting the Saint Helen and Notre Dame Islands. They were home to the\
  \ Expo 67, a grandiose event that forever changed the city. The first island houses\
  \ the Biosphere, a museum dedicated to the environment and offers a stunning view\
  \ of the area, while the second hosts the Canadian Grand Prix in F1. In those islands\
  \ I had one of the most memorable moments of my trip: after ten years, I finally\
  \ rode a bike again. I felt like a child, struggling to maintain balance, but it\
  \ was so fun. As I stroke through the park giggling to myself, I completely lost\
  \ track of time \u2013 so much so that I had to pay a fee for returning the rental\
  \ bike late.\nIf you prefer cultural tours, Montreal is also the place for you.\
  \ The Museum of Fine Arts has an impressive collection and offers discounts for\
  \ young adults. Also, the city is home to the famous Cirque du Soleil and you can\
  \ watch their newest shows in the dazzling Vieux Port. I\u2019d never thought I\u2019\
  d have a chance to see them live, but I got to watch \u2018Volta\u2019 just a month\
  \ after the opening!\nWhile there, I also visited the lovely adorned Portuguese\
  \ neighborhood and talked, in Portuguese of course, to immigrants who had been living\
  \ in Canada for decades and just missed speaking their mother tongue. Talking about\
  \ languages, In Montreal I practiced my poor French with the very patient and kind\
  \ Qu\xE9b\xE9cois people, who would easily turn to English when necessary. \nThus,\
  \ this journey in Montreal taught me to face my fears of exploring the world alone.\
  \ Ever since that trip, I made traveling by myself a habit and I experienced cities\
  \ like Los Angeles, San Francisco and Buenos Aires solo. I hope to inspire other\
  \ women (and men) to find the courage in themselves to do the same."
