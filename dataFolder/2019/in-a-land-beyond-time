Text: "The stony road clatters under the horses\u2019 hooves as we travel further\
  \ into the timeless mountains of central Kyrgyzstan. Here, at around 3000 meters\
  \ altitude, colours are intensified as the clouds paint patterns over the grassy\
  \ land before us, controlling whether we are freezing in the shade or sweating in\
  \ the sunlight. This country is referred to as \u201Cthe Switzerland of Asia\u201D\
  , but I\u2019d rather say that it looks like the lovechild between the old Wild\
  \ West and Tolkien\u2019s Middle-Earth.\n\nThe air is fresh, free from pollution\
  \ and easy to breathe, but its lack of oxygen quickly makes me out of breath. Yet\
  \ people are living here during the summer and they come here to hunt during the\
  \ winter. This is the land of the shepherds: people renting a piece of mountain\
  \ land from the local government on which they tend for cows, horses and sheep between\
  \ June and the 29th of September each year.\n\n\u201CWhy the 29th?\u201D we ask\
  \ our 19-year-old guide Beksultan, who, in very formidable fashion, always wears\
  \ his Adidas jumpsuit complete with its three stripes. \n\n\u201CBecause the wolves\
  \ come down from the mountains,\u201D our translator Nargiza says as if that was\
  \ obvious.\n\nThe shepherds live with their families in traditional nomadic huts\
  \ called yurta, a white circular structure of one room, built by either animal skin,\
  \ mud or \u2013 the more modern ones \u2013 tarpaulins. They don\u2019t build any\
  \ fences, but let the animals walk freely beneath the snowclad peaks and along the\
  \ silvery, twisting rivers. And that is what makes this place look like something\
  \ out of a movie: seeing herds of horses roaming free the way horses were meant\
  \ to do.\n\n\u201CIt\u2019s like you\u2019ve never seen a horse until you\u2019\
  ve seen them like this,\u201D my friend says as we admired the colourful beauty\
  \ of the animals.\n\nOn our fourth day in the mountains, we are invited for lunch\
  \ to the yurta of a mother and her one-year-old daughter Alina. The inside is shady\
  \ and cool, smelling thick of earth, smoke and horse, with a sour undertone of the\
  \ \u201CKyrgyz champagne\u201D, kymyz, which is a specialty of the shepherds. It\
  \ is fermented horse milk collected and made here in the mountains, then poured\
  \ into old PET-bottles or dried into cheesy yoghurt-balls before being sold to a\
  \ man in a rusty, military green hippie-bus replica. This man will then bring the\
  \ bottles down to the cities and villages where they will be sold in supermarkets\
  \ and convenient stores. \n\nAlina\u2019s mother interrupts her cooking of golden\
  \ apricot jam on the small wood burning stove when we arrive since it is custom\
  \ for the shepherds to invite passing travelers for tea. As we sit down on pillows\
  \ and dusty, stale smelling blankets, Nargiza and the young mother sets the low\
  \ table with bread, homemade jam and nuts. Later, as we sip weak black tea with\
  \ plenty of sugar, Nargiza explains to us that the father of the family is in the\
  \ nearest village to sell hay; a mere eight hours by car or three days away by horse.\
  \ We never get around asking whether he took the car or the horse for his trip.\
  \ \n\nAfter lunch, little Alina struts around in her pink outfit outside the yurta\
  \ while her mother puts on a scarf and grabs the pail to go and milk the horses,\
  \ a task that needs to be done every two hours. Alina peers at us, wondering what\
  \ kind of strange creatures we are. As my friend tries to win her friendship, I\
  \ can\u2019t help but wonder what her life will be like. Kyrgyzstan is developing,\
  \ but since poverty and bridal kidnappings are still a reality, and the growing\
  \ tourism industry is starting to affect the people and the nature, there is no\
  \ saying what will happen in the future. All I know is that for me, Kyrgyzstan went\
  \ from being an overlooked spot on the map to become one of the most fascinating\
  \ and naturally beautiful places imaginable."
