Text: "Tag along to know how it all happened, so placidly, very beautifully and a\
  \ bit crazily. After spending a week in pure serenity and serendipity, I am motivated\
  \ enough to share all the excitement and experiences. Have a happy read!\nThis country\
  \ has a lot to offer, if you are into history, or into beaches or into culture,\
  \ and if not, it can turn you to one.\nThe trip began from Split, the second largest\
  \ city in the country, forming the centre of the Dalmatia region. The energetic\
  \ Dalmatian breed of dogs belong here.\nSplit, to me came across as a very modern\
  \ town residing inside the Diocletian palace, which is a UNESCO heritage site and\
  \ the heart and soul of the city. The white marbles and the in-house limestones\
  \ left no stone unturned in beautifying the city and that supremacy can be seen\
  \ from far.\nMy personal favourite part of the palace was the Vestibule, rectangular\
  \ on outside, oval from inside and open from top. It is definitely a fascinating\
  \ one. The localites seemed to be pretty cool people, coming down to help when they\
  \ see you struggling for that perfect selfie with the gigantic 8.5 m tall statue\
  \ of the nerdy Gregory of Nin. \nThe narrow streets, the handicraft shops, the cosy\
  \ bars, it all renders warmth to the city and ambience. Strolling, getting lost\
  \ and relocating yourself was a wonderful experience. Later, I moved to the port\
  \ to enjoy the calming dusk by the harbour which was very fulfilling.\nThe next\
  \ day was strictly dedicated to the Krka national park, which was formed to protect\
  \ the Krka river. The Krka waterfalls were magnificent and the cherry on the cake\
  \ is that there you are allowed to swim.\nThe walk on the 2 km long wooden bridge\
  \ across the river was another enticement. Vanishing in the lush greens with the\
  \ surging and plunging sound of those falls vitalize you to the next level.\nThe\
  \ next destination was Hvar, the famous Croatian party island which is one of a\
  \ kind. Even a glimpse of the bright and shiny St. Stephen\u2019s square can leave\
  \ you awed. The view of the Pakleni islands from the city centre was alluring.\n\
  Croatia has a multifaceted natural value, right from the most beautiful beaches\
  \ to the most intriguing hills captured by a captivating fortress at the top guarding\
  \ all the city stretch at once. It was a short hike from the city to the fort which\
  \ ends with some breathtaking views of the city and the harbour. It was clearly\
  \ a photographer\u2019s paradise. Relaxing and witnessing the sun sink in the Adriatic\
  \ was the most satisfying deal of the day.\nThe next day followed some adventure\
  \ and exploration of a hidden paradise by a Boat tour. It was to the island of Vis,\
  \ Bisevo and Pakleni.\nThe pinnacle destination was the ravishing blue caves which\
  \ can make you go bonkers. Never in my life I have seen something this ridiculously\
  \ amazing. The iridescent blue glowing effect inside the cave without any light\
  \ source was mesmerizing. I was left jaw dropped.\nThen we moved to the green caves,\
  \ which was slightly bigger. Surrounded by bright rocky cliffs, the sea emited emerald-green\
  \ colour and this is the moment when you are bound to lose yourself in that picturesque\
  \ beauty of the landscape.\nThen we halted at Palmizana bay of the Pakleni islands\
  \ which was no less than a wonderland.\nNext day was assigned to the city of Bol\
  \ on the Brac island. Brac is known to be the biggest producer of limestone and\
  \ white marbles, which was even exported for the construction of The White House.\n\
  The Zlatni Rat aka the Golden Cape, a white pebble beach and one of the best beaches\
  \ in Europe resides here. It stands out because of its distinct tongue shape and\
  \ the tip is known to change its direction every two to three years due of the wind.\n\
  Overall, it was a blissful experience in Croatia, everything just clicked, perfect\
  \ weather, perfect season, perfect holiday, and a little imperfect me. \"Hell Yes\"\
  \ would be my recommendation for this place! Highly and strongly recommended."
