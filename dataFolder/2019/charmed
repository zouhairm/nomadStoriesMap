Text: "France 2012. Now, I was fifteen at the time, so I was travelling with my family.\
  \ We did all the touristy things, we ventured up to the top of the Eiffel Tower\
  \ and wandered the Champs-\xC9lys\xE9es. Next on the list was visiting the Sacr\xE9\
  -Coeur Basilica, a beautiful 1070s church. I remember thinking to myself, \nnot\
  \ another church'. After visiting England and all the churches they have to offer\
  \ there, and a few others along the way to Paris, my fifteen year old self could\
  \ not think of anything worse. Especially after seeing the amount of steps I was\
  \ about to endure. After a lot of convincing, and a bribe of a future ice-cream,\
  \ I steadily headed up to the top of those stairs. Closely following my family,\
  \ we reached a corner not too far off the white stoned church.\n\nThere was people\
  \ everywhere, although it took me a couple of minutes to realise that they were\
  \ even there. To my amazement there was a square full of artists and cafe shops\
  \ where people were eating croissants and ordering coffees. I remember being so\
  \ taken a back. It was the most incredible sight. There was culture everywhere,\
  \ in every different style of painting and drawing, from cartoon portraits to a\
  \ more realistic approach. I had never seen anything like this and I most certainly\
  \ did not expect it when heading to the church.\n\nMy parents maid my brothers and\
  \ I sit for a portrait, which is now hanging in their house. I remember mine made\
  \ me look like I had a very fat chin/cheek section. None of that mattered though,\
  \ I was so charmed by this little square that suddenly what originally felt like\
  \ a hike up the stairs became a faint memory that I would happily do again, just\
  \ to experience the people and culture in this beautiful city. \n\nWe continued\
  \ on through to the Sacr\xE9-Coeur, and the stunning views that surround the basilica.\
  \ On my way out, the only thing I remember thinking is that I cannot wait until\
  \ I'm older enough to travel by myself and get lost in cities to find the locals\
  \ and their markets off the beaten path, not too different from the one I had just\
  \ encountered."
