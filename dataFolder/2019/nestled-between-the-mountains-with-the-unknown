Text: "On my quest to finding pure serenity & solace I managed to stumble upon nature's\
  \ utopia. Nestled between Limpopo's vast and mountainous escarpement,I took a leap\
  \ into the unknown... \n\nSituated within Limpopo's lush and incredible anatomy\
  \ I travelled into the perfect sanctuary for a \"solace seeking\" traveller who\
  \ wanted to be one with Mother Nature. After driving within the mountaineering escarpment\
  \ with a diverse biodiversity and breathtaking view,I had reached my own backyard\
  \ Nirvana (MABALINGWE NATURE RESERVE). \nThe scenic route enthralled me within a\
  \ majestic variation of Avery species & abundant wildlife. I was engulfed within\
  \ wonder and a spike of chill when I reached the foot of her ethereal and garden-like\
  \ stature. \nThe scenery was reminiscent of the unbeknownst \"GARDEN OF EDEN\" that\
  \ had manifested right in front of my eyes. I was captivated & after a heartfelt\
  \ deep breath,I felt a sudden relaxation and silent acceptance from Nature. \nThe\
  \ 5 hour drive to our chalets couldn't matter because her beauty was both riveting\
  \ & never-ending. I felt aligned with her and spiritually at ease,due to her calming\
  \ nature. Arriving at our destination filled my heart up with a surge of both excitement\
  \ and caution, I didn't knowbwhat to expect from her,her beauty was silent with\
  \ a hint of eerieness that would leave one slightly unsettled. There was beauty\
  \ and mystery in this.\n\nNight had fallen and her embrace grew warmer and enticing.\
  \ The various sounds of the lively biodiversity that lingered behind the dense forestry\
  \ left me with great angst,but an unshakable sense of belonging and safety. \nSpending\
  \ the night with an HD view of nature was more than a sight to see & experience.\
  \ \nThe wildlife aided as her lullaby and the morning after called for a morning\
  \ hike to fully experience her spirit and anatomy. \nIt was always vibrant and lively,\
  \ never settling for domestication or civilization. She was too majestic to succumb\
  \ to my fear or inquisition. \n\nThe nights carried an eerie sense of melancholy\
  \ mixed with the density of the pure mountain air. \nThe morning breezes blew life\
  \ within my lungs and other places within me that remained suffocated and enclosed.\
  \ The view left me marvelled & more amazed with each angle the sun danced in the\
  \ clear blue skies. \nThe sunsets felt like home. They looked like burning amber\
  \ glistening within my eyes and leaving me in plain disbelief and wonder. \nWith\
  \ each waking day I was surprised to discover new and amazing species of insects,felines,ostriches,hippo's\
  \ and other unimaginable wildlife. \n\nThe MABALINGWE NATURE RESERVE gave an in\
  \ depth experience with activities like 'Mountain Hiking,Lion feeding,hippo watching,\
  \ River Rafting' and many action packed activities that would give one an unforgettable\
  \ experience that is more than money's worth. \n\nI had never experienced nature\
  \ to THIS degree. It felt like I gave her a visit and this was her domain. My respect\
  \ & need for conserving nature grew stronger and my affair with her grew more intense.\
  \ I was beginning to fall inlove with every dimension and aspect of her GRAND FIGURE.\
  \ \nThe skyline during the night looked magnified and the stars looked more personified\
  \ and near,the area's beauty was unforgiving and one could see that through spectators\
  \ facial expressions and evident gasps,that you could never get used to it's appeal\
  \ and experience. \nHer feral counterparts we quite interactive and gave me a \"\
  settled\" feeling. Imagine waking up to an exquisite and majestic view with fairly\
  \ interactive and grandiose ecosystem that embraces you, playfully. \n\nBeing isolated\
  \ in such a beautiful sanctuary brought memories and chills down my spine (that\
  \ I can still feel to this very day). \nIt gave one a sense of clarity & solace.\
  \ \nEven through her beaming magnificence,I found a sense of spiritual intuition\
  \ & calm.\n\nI took a leap into the unknown and it became one of the most fulfilling\
  \ and memorable experiences of my entire life. \nMABALINGWE NATURE RESERVE conserves\
  \ animals,botany & the entire ecosystem in a holistically harmonious experience\
  \ for both MAN and Nature. \n\nI went there seeking isolation and a weekend filled\
  \ with silence and peace of mind,but I left with an unimaginable experience with\
  \ nature. My weekend long leap into the unknown left me with a great appreciation\
  \ and unrelenting love for nature & conservation. \n\nTravel more."
