Text: "I\u2019ve never had this feeling before. A feeling of happiness that consumes\
  \ you and inspires you in the same time.  I have never thought that one small city\
  \ can do this to me.\n\tIt all happened unexpectedly, as maybe all of the great\
  \ things in our life do. During my time in Spain I wanted to spend a couple of days\
  \ in a small city of Cadiz just to change the atmosphere. I wanted to escape from\
  \ the noise of the large Spanish cities and to relax. However, by chance, I received\
  \ a lot more than I could imagine. \n\tDo you know this feeling of \u201Cclicking\u201D\
  \ with a city? A full connection to a place usually happens during the first minutes\
  \ in it, when you stop the rush, take a deep breath and start feeling better with\
  \ no reason. Walking through the town from a bus station, knowing nothing about\
  \ it and carrying my travel bag with me I already knew: that place was special.\
  \ A breathtaking mix of European and Moroccan culture, exotic plants and ancient\
  \ buildings, friendly locals who love their city as much as they can, narrow streets\
  \ that have seen more than any human being can imagine. All of this together throws\
  \ you into the deep water of unique history and a special kind of admiration. And\
  \ talking about water\u2026 Half an hour after my arrival I met a friend \u2013\
  \ a great Atlantic ocean, a Protector and Patron of the city of Cadiz. \n\tThis\
  \ new friend of mine has been supporting me during my days there. He showed me what\
  \ harmony really meant. He was walking around Cadiz with me, telling me stories\
  \ of what this city had encountered in past, how its good and bad days looked like,\
  \ what the locals did here and why they agreed on the thought that they lived in\
  \ the best place on Earth. He showed me how much people valued their ancient history\
  \ traditions and how they found balance between religion and modernity in the same\
  \ time. He let me dive into the atmosphere of happiness and harmony and the feeling\
  \ of being protected. He explained me which ideas of mine were good and which should\
  \ be altered. He made happiness a central point of his thoughts and even made me\
  \ cry because of it. So I made him a promise. I told him that I would be happy no\
  \ matter what. That I would say \u201Cno\u201D to things that didn\u2019t make me\
  \ feel right and that I wouldn\u2019t be afraid to do more to make my goals come\
  \ true. \n\tWhen I travel, I always know that some part of the information I receive\
  \ will be unbarred after the trip itself. I deeply believe that the traveler should\
  \ take some time to process what he\u2019s seen and that he has to make up his final\
  \ opinion only when some time passes. What I can tell now is that those two days\
  \ became a reference point and a final judgment for me when it comes to important\
  \ life decisions. I will never be able to forget that encounter with happiness and\
  \ will always remember that unexpected inner findings that my Great friend inspired\
  \ me to do. The promise of happiness made to something eternal happened to be a\
  \ way for me to become a better version of myself."
