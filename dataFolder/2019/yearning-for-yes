Text: "The laughs of children playing outside slowly played through my unconscious\
  \ mind as it transitioned from a state a dreaming to a full awakening. Softly I\
  \ awakened, realizing the children in my dreams were actually outside, and their\
  \ cries were serenading me awake into this final day of my stay in Siem Reap. It\
  \ was almost as if the universe was preparing me gently for this, quite literal,\
  \ holiday in Cambodia. \n\nCasimir returned to our house after setting out on a\
  \ quest to find beer because it was noon now and naturally, it meant it was time.\
  \ He greeted us with, \u201CDude, come sing karaoke with us\u201D. I could feel\
  \ it becoming a \u201Cyes\u201D day, where saying yes to new adventures would engulf\
  \ me completely into this new culture we\u2019ve been surrounded by in Siem Reap.\
  \ \n\nWe walked down our road, which in this village consisted of dirt paths. The\
  \ wild chickens and dogs lined the roads while keeping to themselves, cohabiting\
  \ this area with the humans. We passed the children who incessantly harbor the road\
  \ with their laughter, not afraid to bombard you with pleas to join them in their\
  \ games. The true beauty of children being outside and creating entertainment brought\
  \ an air of light to the streets. \n\nAs we turned the corner we arrived to our\
  \ friend Chin\u2019s house. He was a petite, fiery, Cambodian who was funneling\
  \ his soul into a native song through the microphone. \u201CCheers!\u201D, he yelled\
  \ as we all raised our beverages to the spirit of karaoke. One by one we took our\
  \ moment of fame with the microphone. The brigade of children came to join us as\
  \ we all coexisted as one community. One family. \n\nThis was the Day of 7. January\
  \ 7th, also known as the Cambodian Victory Day. Today commemorated the fall of the\
  \ Khmer Rouge regime that committed genocide on millions of Cambodians. Since the\
  \ day signifies a horribly dark memory, many keep a solemn remembrance. Not Chin.\
  \ Chin and his community felt otherwise, they felt proud of their country and what\
  \ they have become. The optimism and pride they held for their country and the progress\
  \ it has made in such little time was so large that it radiated everywhere you went.\
  \ So he carried on with his singing in the streets. \n\nWhen the sun began to fall,\
  \ the music began to heighten. The neighbors to our homestay just finished constructing\
  \ their house, so, to celebrate the housewarming and the holiday, there was a party!\
  \ There was a wall of speakers about 10 feet high, playing music so loud you couldn\u2019\
  t hear the person next to you. Monks gathered around to greet everyone arriving\
  \ and recited prayers to the neighborhood as a call to celebration. Although we\
  \ had to leave early the next morning for the airport, we couldn\u2019t resist a\
  \ true Cambodian celebration. As we said \u201Cyes\u201D to another event on the\
  \ agenda for the day, we were welcomed graciously with beers handed to us left and\
  \ right. It was almost as if the party was for us! Our new friends taught us the\
  \ moves to their dances, and around in a circle we danced all night. \n\nAll night,\
  \ the music continued to bless the house and permitted us to get only a few hours\
  \ of sleep before we had to leave. We walked outside, still groggy considering the\
  \ early hour, and were shocked to see a handful of our new friends who came to wish\
  \ us farewell. As we drove off, Chin yelled to us; \u201CHey, see you later my crazy\
  \ American family!\u201D."
