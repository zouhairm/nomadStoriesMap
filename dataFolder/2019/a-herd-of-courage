Text: "\u201CThis is how I am going to die\u2026\u201D I thought to myself while being\
  \ jostled around in the backseat of an old truck. \u201CPlease, God, if I make it\
  \ out of here alive, I promise no more solo adventures,\u201D I pleaded to the powers\
  \ above. I was in the outskirts of Chiang Mia, Thailand traveling with a group of\
  \ tourists and local driver.\n\n I impulsively booked a solo vacation to Thailand\
  \ and, maybe against better judgment, signed myself up on a volunteer trip to feed\
  \ and bathe elephants outside of the city.\n\n On my way to my hostel, I saw a small\
  \ booth set up in an outside market advertising local excursions. Intrigued, I greeted\
  \ the owner, a petite Thai woman, and read over the brochures. After much internal\
  \ debate, I decided to volunteer at an ethical elephant sanctuary. I was in awe\
  \ of elephants as a child, so I wanted to spend a day helping them. Elated with\
  \ a sale, the owner took my cash and handed me a yellow receipt. Exhausted from\
  \ my previous travels, I retreated back to my room and prepared for my excursion.\n\
  \n I woke up early, pulled my long brown hair into a ponytail, and packed my pink\
  \ backpack for adventure. I ordered a Thai iced tea to go and stood waiting with\
  \ my yellow slip. Approximately 30 minutes late, my ride appeared. After confirming\
  \ my booking, I climbed into the backseat, hoping not to be thrown out the open\
  \ back. The driver sped off to pick up the other volunteers in our group: a young\
  \ American female volunteering for medical school, two Swedish girls backpacking\
  \ through Asia, and a quirky older German couple on holiday. \n\nConversation flowed\
  \ until we were out of the city and into the countryside. The roads became less\
  \ pronounced and rocky, and locals were walking barefoot, staring curiously at the\
  \ tourists. I felt relieved getting closer to camp but held on tighter as the truck\
  \ turned onto a dirt road. I closed my eyes as we drove up a steep and narrow hill.\
  \ \n\nAfter a few minutes and several prayers, I opened my eyes and saw vast green\
  \ fields and a herd of grazing elephants. As we got closer, I noticed the animals\u2019\
  \ soft, wrinkled skin, fine hair, and calm demeanor. Once we parked, I hesitantly\
  \ approached them. After a few sniffs and a whiff of the food in my hand, they welcomed\
  \ my presence. The fear I felt that morning subsided, and I marveled at their intelligence.\
  \ \n\nThe elephants ate bountiful amounts of sugar cane, enjoyed mud baths to escape\
  \ the heat, and basked in the sun. My favorite elephant, a 400-pound \u201Cbaby\u201D\
  \ named Ella, loved to be stroked and almost knocked me over trying to sit down.\
  \ These creatures, abused in the tourism industry, astounded me with their continued\
  \ love and trust.\n\n The day slowly came to an end, and I remorsefully said goodbye\
  \ to the herd. On our walk back to the truck, I closed my eyes, relishing in my\
  \ new memories. Once seated, I held onto the exterior with steadfast grit and prepared\
  \ for the ride back to town. I was inspired by the elephants\u2019 courage and decided\
  \ to muster up some of my own. \u201COkay listen, God, maybe just one more solo\
  \ adventure\u2026\u201D"
