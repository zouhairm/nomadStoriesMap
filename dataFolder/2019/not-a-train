Text: "That morning I was dragging my suitcase on the steaming tarmac, which was becoming\
  \ sticky, when my phone rang. I was going to the train station where a boiling seat\
  \ of an old wagon would have been waiting for me, longing to bring my flushed body\
  \ to Tuscany seaside. I picked up the phone and the metallic voice on the other\
  \ side reinvigorated my mind, already blurred by the hot weather of August. It was\
  \ the message my grandma left two hours before to wish me a good trip: she was expecting\
  \ for me to arrive to her house in a small town with just a hundred of houses and\
  \ some local shops. I was a bit pestered about my trip: every year, the same holiday\
  \ in that little place full of elderly men and women, no friends, no new place to\
  \ go, therefore the routine annoys me and I annoy ordinary people. I usually spend\
  \ that month of the year reading books and walking around trying to find out something\
  \ new not to get bored in the mugginess of the summer. I stopped the message and\
  \ I put the phone in the backpack I had on my shoulder, then I arrived at the track\
  \ and I patiently waited for the train to open the doors: finally I got in and I\
  \ sit on a feverish seat, ascertaining that the lack of air-conditioning. It was\
  \ not a problem for me, because the best part of the entire holiday would have been\
  \ the train trip: I love following with my eyes every landscape outside of my widow,\
  \ wandering about places, times, stories. I usually surprise myself creating stories\
  \ and dialogues in my mind just watching what\u2019s outside the train: also a sycamore\
  \ could be the spark of a story that begins in the fields and ends in my imagination.\
  \ \nAfter a couple of hours, when the train was in the middle of its route, I heard\
  \ a shrill sound: it arrived even in my eardrum and I was obliged to close my eyes\
  \ and use my hands to protect my head. It was something automatic, like when a wave\
  \ hits you and you jump out of the water because you don\u2019t want to get soaked.\
  \ After an endless time, I opened my eyes and I found out the train had a problem\
  \ and the train driver sharply slowed down until where I was discovering that moment:\
  \ we were stopping for a few hours \u2013 as the announce was repeating- in a small\
  \ station in the hinterland of Siena. I asked the people around me if it was possible\
  \ to descend and spend outside the next two hours. The welcoming smile of the man\
  \ in front of me reassured everyone because he said it had already happened to him,\
  \ and after a while de problem would have been resolved. I took my backpack and\
  \ my suitcase and I decided to get out the train: as soon as my feet touched the\
  \ ground, I felt a kind of happiness I can\u2019t describe. I checked the time \u2013\
  \ 3:57 PM, when the hot sun of summer frees its energy the most- and I called my\
  \ grandma not to alarm her of my delay. \u201CJust a couple of hours and I will\
  \ be there\u201D, I said calmly, while I was exiting from the station and walking\
  \ down an unknown, crowded street. I turned off my phone and I dragged my suitcase\
  \ energetically, like I had a new force and the hot weather wasn\u2019t a problem\
  \ anymore. My eyes were shining and they wedged in every corner of the streets,\
  \ charmed by an accident that would have been the best part of my journey, exactly\
  \ because unexpected. I remember I spent all the time I had walking down those stranger\
  \ streets realising that it was what I had not planned the best part of my travel.\
  \ When I saw my grandma at the station, I smiled to her as I never did before: I\
  \ was happy before getting there, and ready to \u201Cbreak my train\u201D more and\
  \ more."
