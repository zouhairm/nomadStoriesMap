Text: "When we were staying at our hip hostel in Granada, I noticed a flyer for an\
  \ oasis on the Pacific called Surfing Turtle Lodge. It advertised cheap rooms on\
  \ the beach and your chance to volunteer with baby sea turtles. This opportunity\
  \ was one of the reasons Ilene and I came to Central America. I took a picture to\
  \ save it for future reference, and we proceeded with our journey through Nicaragua.\
  \ We spent a tranquilo five days on Ometepe, then ventured into the chaos of Managua\
  \ and Leon. Near Leon, we hiked up, then sled down the slopes of the youngest active\
  \ volcano in the country. After these adventures, it was almost time for us to split\
  \ ways with our new travel buddy, Atti, as he continued north into El Salvador/Honduras.\
  \ But one last desire lingered before we made our way south, back to Costa Rica.\
  \ I raised the question, \u201CSurfing Turtle?\u201D Atti, without hesitation, responded,\
  \ \u201CI\u2019m good, boy.\u201D Atti booked a dorm bed for $5 and we booked a\
  \ semi-private room for $18 total. We made the long trek to the isolated hostel.\
  \ \n\nAfter bussing, boating, and a horse carriage, we finally made it.\nThat afternoon,\
  \ we enjoyed the best of what the equatorial Pacific has to offer, and patiently\
  \ waited for the tournament festivities to subside. From our shared ocean view balcony,\
  \ we ate a typical Nica dinner and watched the sun dip into the unknown. As darkness\
  \ took over, Atti and I eventually made our way down to the beach to catch a glimpse\
  \ of the milky way. I hadn\u2019t observed stars quite like that since remote camping\
  \ in the mountains of Peru. We soon became distracted by movement in the sand. To\
  \ our amazement, two baby sea turtles were scurrying through the sand towards the\
  \ lights of Surfing Turtle. Atti picked one up and I cradled the other. They were\
  \ a bit frantic and needed to find the ocean soon. Their flippers felt soft, smooth\
  \ and cool, like a leather boot on a damp day. Ilene was up in the room, missing\
  \ out on a magical moment. I sent her an emergency alert text as we nudged the nuggets\
  \ towards the ocean. Ilene made her way down and the three of us scoured the sand\
  \ near the hatchery. One, two, three more turtles. We were amidst a very unique\
  \ experience. Only the three of us were helping these delicate creatures find their\
  \ natural habitat. Workers finally noticed the commotion and tended to the ongoing\
  \ hatching. They collected nearly 100 turtles from inside the hatchery and lead\
  \ them into the waves as other guests gathered round in excitement. Drunkards didn't\
  \ listen to the instructions of the workers and shined their cell phone flashlights\
  \ for a better look. Unknowingly, artificial light from humans can confuse baby\
  \ turtles, as their natural instinct is to head towards the reflection of the moonlight\
  \ on the ocean. \n\nWe have a delicate, double-edged sword predicament. Outsiders\
  \ may be quick to judge what\u2019s going on. At first, we were also a bit apprehensive\
  \ with the operation. Maybe the hatchery is too close to the action? Maybe partying\
  \ shouldn\u2019t be mixed with conservation? One should agree. But there\u2019s\
  \ a unique situation going on here. The underlying problem is that poachers scavenge\
  \ for turtle eggs to either eat or sell. Surfing Turtle Lodge found a solution to\
  \ this issue. They use proceeds from guests and events like the weekly volleyball\
  \ tournament to fund the purchase and proper raising of turtle eggs. In other words,\
  \ if Surfing Turtle didn\u2019t buy those eggs, the baby turtles we helped save\
  \ wouldn\u2019t even exist today. Be careful how you criticize and critique on the\
  \ surface. Dig deeper, and you will understand and find joy in efforts that people\
  \ are making to conserve what truly matters on our planet."
