Text: "Home, for many of us, has less to do with a piece of soil than with a piece\
  \ of soul. Every time I travel and a stranger asks me \u201CWhere\u2019s your home?\u201D\
  , I think of my family, or my closest friends or the songs that travel with me wherever\
  \ I happen to be. For me, my home has always been whatever I carried around inside\
  \ me and not a physical representation of sorts. In fact as a millennial, I feel\
  \ privileged and absolutely liberated with this feeling. Think about it. For generations,\
  \ our ancestors and perhaps even our parents were assigned their sense of home and\
  \ community at the time of their birth and barely had any chance of stepping outside\
  \ that paradigm. Today, it\u2019s a different story. Today, we are free to choose\
  \ our sense of home, create our sense of community, and build our sense of self.\n\
  \nAnd this realization completely dawned on me during my recent holiday to the beautiful\
  \ yet understated land of Laos. Hopping between Luang Prabang, Vang Vieng and Vientiane,\
  \ my heart met with many like-minded others and my brain found its creative fuel\
  \ in every conversation with a local stranger. A multi-faceted surprise of sorts,\
  \ Laos taught me the simple joys of life, the unmatched luxury of being content\
  \ and the sheer happiness of living in the present. \n\nThe real voyage of discovery\
  \ as Marcel Proust, famously said, \u201Cconsists not in seeing new sights, but\
  \ in looking with new eyes\u201D. And once you have new eyes, the old sights, even\
  \ your home, appear different. We are fortunate to be living in this age of movement\
  \ that brings with it some exhilarating new possibilities and opportunities. Where\
  \ we come from now is far less important than where we are going and home is no\
  \ longer a place where we are born but rather the place we become ourselves. So\
  \ many people these days practice a ritual of meditating in the morning without\
  \ their devices or go running after work in the evening to collect their thoughts\
  \ or leave their mobile phones back home when they step out to have a long conversation\
  \ with an old friend over coffee. Movement is a fantastic entitlement that allows\
  \ us to do so much more than our grandparents or even parents imagined. But the\
  \ movement is more meaningful when you have a home to return to, one that is not\
  \ just the place where you sleep but the place where you stand."
