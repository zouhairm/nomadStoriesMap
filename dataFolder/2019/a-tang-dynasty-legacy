Text: "My mind has been poisoned by the phenomenal history and epic culture here since\
  \ I was a kid. I got fascinated by the beauty of nature, food & philosophy of life\
  \ which exist over 4000 years. Some people had warned me don\u2019t go to China\
  \ it would be a real challenge and the country isn\u2019t beautiful as I thought,\
  \ Yet I know it was just a stereotype and misconception in society. Now I made it\
  \ here after 15 years dream to explore.  As I step down I felt the weather was very\
  \ humid it cause my lung\u2019s hard to pump some blood to sniff oxygen, affect\
  \ me hard to breathe. It was summertime in China the heat burned my body in and\
  \ out, I\u2019m a tropical girl but trust me hot weather in China was unbearable.\
  \ An old friend Jiaojio promised to show me something expulsion, I got excited again\
  \ although I got sticky and had excessive sweat. We walked around Guangzhou City\
  \ through the slum area crowded and smoggy. I felt a bit worried as the whole street\
  \ full of people, I saw a group of men playing mahjong game while on the other side\
  \ kids were running around.  \n\nIn China we used to judged women beauty by their\
  \ feet Jioajio tried to give me a clue what we were going to see, It\u2019s called\
  \ Foot binding! This custom was practice for over 1000 years, it was one of the\
  \ Chinese beauty trends. My mind starts to blowing up imagine this an ancient beauty\
  \ merely I wonder why she took me through the landfill, I almost threw up as I smell\
  \ the air, I saw most of the houses were wobbly, dirty, full of rubbish and lack\
  \ of sanitation, they lived in extremely uncomfortable circumstances. But People\
  \ seems tougher than I thought I couldn\u2019t understand one single word that I\
  \ heard so I cannot guess either they were fighting or talking, they were so noisy\
  \ and yelled to each other. Jioajio stopped in front of a tiny house \"Ni-hao\"\
  \ she said greeting in Chinese, an old lady coming in a wheelchair. She might be\
  \ around 90 years old her feet were really small wore beautifully embroidered shoe\
  \ just like doll size. Probably around 4 or 3 inches I stunned, tried to smile at\
  \ the same time. \n\nShe was an icon in her era, jiaojio started to unfold the story,\
  \ She was forced to had small feet in order to get a better husband. The custom\
  \ was practice from a Tang Dynasty as a status symbol among the elite. In the early\
  \ 20th century millions of Chinese women stood in devotion to serve their husband.\
  \ Foot binding practice turned into ethnic pride, the most desirable woman judges\
  \ within 3 inches feet, it was known as a \u201Cgolden lotus\u201D size. I was captivated\
  \ as I held her feet lies in my palm even so horrific imagined these feet forced\
  \ to be misshapen began when she was only 5 years old.\n \nIt was a barbaric action\
  \ of beauty for women to be chosen by men and married the elite. They need to sacrifice\
  \ their life, burden the pain for the rest of their lives. Women were considered\
  \ as slaves for the century, they had no voice toward everything and this culture\
  \ behaviour prevented a woman to cheat on her husband, Faithfulness cost extremely\
  \ expensive back in time.\n\nI guess my grandma was the last generation who practised\
  \ foot binding after the Tang Dynasty fell. As time changed women are able to speak\
  \ out against the old system, A beauty no longer measured by 3 inches feet. I staggeringly\
  \ surprised this lady was Jiaojio family.\n\nWe may from different places, however,\
  \ our culture has a resemblance about women right and beauty perception hasn't changed\
  \ through centuries sometimes to look beautiful women still have to feel the pain\
  \ just in a different way, I tried to assure Jiaojio!"
