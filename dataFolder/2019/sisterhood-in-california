Text: "Right now I feel flabbergasted at this life that\u2019s mine to live. I am\
  \ on my way back from vacationing with my soul mate for the first time in the really\
  \ sunny and equally as cold Santa Monica, California. We spend most of our time\
  \ high at the beach and on swigs. Her favorite is the egg swing because she feels\
  \ cuddled. We watch the water fighting the sand creating the shore. The birds peck\
  \ into the sand as little blonde kids chase after them until the kids decide they\
  \ want potato chips. Now they are the ones running away. The beach becomes a playground\
  \ of human and nature interaction. There are people riding bikes, searching for\
  \ lost rings, riding waves, exercising, picnics, and Zen space. \n\nEvery night\
  \ we go out to eat at a new place. One day we find the Dominican Republic flag painted\
  \ on the fence right next to our table reminding us home is never too far away.\
  \ We spend days filling our bellies and hearts with meals and laughter. Our vacation\
  \ days\u2019 smell of Mad Men and signs that serve as artifacts to stuff in our\
  \ memory boxes. We walk boardwalks full of birds and limes that are scooters. \n\
  Our conversations four years overdue that we are not sure will do more harm than\
  \ good or maybe just too heavy for starting over. Sometimes looking at each other\
  \ standing in the California burning sun remembering times we use to find rocks\
  \ to draw hopscotch in front of grandma\u2019s house in Canarsie. Even recollecting\
  \ memories we\u2019ve forgotten about ourselves. \n\nWe make it to Hollywood one\
  \ night not realizing how cold California can get when the sun goes down. We look\
  \ at each other smiling because we are living out our childhood dreams. We always\
  \ imagine what our future experiences will look like and walking down the California\
  \ streets right by the stars is completing a major experience. We find a red wall\
  \ and start taking pictures for Instagram. We walk a little further and find white\
  \ lights from the top of a star that glistens around in the moonlight.\u201DWait,\
  \ let me get a song.\u201D Of course, its Rihanna because we cannot feel like bosses\
  \ without her in our playlist. In the middle of all of our fun, we run into Rupaul\u2019\
  s star. You jump up and down screaming with excitement because the star finds you.\
  \ \u201CMels!\u201D You call your mom and show her, \u201CWhere is Elvis?\u201D\
  \ \u201CMa, I don\u2019t know. I haven\u2019t seen him.\u201D We explore a few more\
  \ blocks searching for Elvis\u2019 star for your mom until catching the bus heading\
  \ back to the mall area. \u201COMG! The ice cream shop is open!\u201D \u201CI can\
  \ do ice cream!\u201D The ice cream shop is all pink with teddy bears along the\
  \ entire wall.  It smells like marshmallows, sweetness, and good times. We give\
  \ each other the \u201CBitch, it\u2019s about to go down\u201D look. That night\
  \ we took an Uber home and knocked out. \n\nOf course, to every great moment, there\
  \ is always a pause for next time. \u201CTiff what if we don\u2019t go back? We\
  \ can start our lives here. I feel it.\u201D That thought comes to a quick close\
  \ when reality sinks in. We leave our beautiful house from Airbnb. I\u2019m going\
  \ to miss the gates that open up to beautiful stairs surrounded by different species\
  \ of desert plants. \u201CI do not know if I am going back Tiff."
