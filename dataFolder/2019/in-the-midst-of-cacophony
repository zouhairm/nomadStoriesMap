Text: "With my hand gripping tightly to my hat (I\u2019ve already lost one this week\
  \ to the wind), I sit aboard the bus, acutely aware that in spite of the crowd,\
  \ I\u2019m alone on New Year's Eve. By choice, sure, but not without unease. From\
  \ the centre of Reykjavik, we make our way to the suburbs. It is Iceland, there\
  \ aren\u2019t too many roads but before long we are no longer in sight of the \u201C\
  big church\u201D. On every street, in every yard, in every park - everyone is lighting\
  \ fireworks. I press my nose to the window, holding my breath so as to not fog my\
  \ view. \nOur guide explains - the fireworks are sold as a fundraiser by the all-volunteer\
  \ Search and Rescue Teams. These are the people who will come get your car unstuck\
  \ if you decide to ignore a sign regarding an unplowed road ahead, at no cost. I\
  \ make a mental note, in case I need to be rescued later. The perils of solo travel\
  \ are never far.  \nAhead, we see our destination. Frankly, it\u2019s hard to miss\
  \ - a bonfire, 30 feet tall, in the middle of an open field. The community has gathered\
  \ around it, bequeathing to the flames relics of the past year. It\u2019s cheesy,\
  \ but I reach into my pocket to make sure the receipt from my last date with my\
  \ ex is there - I\u2019ve got some things to move on from too. \nAs I stumble off\
  \ the bus, the guide grins at me, \u201CLook up.\u201D \nFor a moment I\u2019m confused,\
  \ but dutifully follow his direction.\nMother Nature is putting on a show of her\
  \ own. The Northern Lights flicker above. \nThe wistful performance catches me off\
  \ guard. With gentle but extraordinary majesty, the pale green ribbons of light\
  \ against the dark night sky leave me breathless and in tears. The weight of the\
  \ receipt in my pocket begins to dissipate, along with my pang of solitude. \nI\
  \ trip as I follow the group - my eyes can\u2019t decide where to look: the roaring\
  \ flames ahead, the sparkle of the fireworks, the magic in the sky. The lights take\
  \ their bow and I slip towards the very edge of the bonfire where volunteers are\
  \ keeping everyone at a safe distance. I can\u2019t understand how they keep their\
  \ backs turned to this sight, but I am grateful.\nBefore long, the crowd thins,\
  \ the fireworks become sporadic, and we\u2019re shuffled back aboard the bus. It\u2019\
  s just before 11pm. As we greedily munching on kleiner, we make our way once again\
  \ through the streets, now much quieter. According to our guide, everyone is inside\
  \ watching \xC1ram\xF3taskaupi\xF0 (New Years Eve Ridicule) - the extraordinarily\
  \ popular nationally broadcast comedy special. Somewhere around 95% of the population\
  \ of Iceland tunes in on New Years, he tells us, one of the highest rated programs\
  \ in the world. \nWe are among the few not watching. In part, the language barrier\
  \ would prevent us from fully grasping the satirical humour. But mostly we have\
  \ yet to reach our destination for the grand finale of the evening.  I lick cardamom\
  \ crumbs from my fingers and press my nose once again to the windows. The Northern\
  \ Lights are back - less vibrant, but ever beautiful. As we come to a stop, they\
  \ wave one final goodbye. \nSitting on the edge of a hill, we wait in silence and\
  \ darkness. \nAll at once, the city explodes. Every resident of Reykjavik is lighting\
  \ a months-salary\u2019s worth of fireworks all around us. There\u2019s no method\
  \ to the madness, just glorious exploding chaos, a near 360\xBA show of rockets\
  \ bursting overhead. With no rhyme or reason, they go off in every direction. \n\
  Under the roar of the explosives, I realise I\u2019m laughing. There\u2019s a catharsis\
  \ in this manic release of energy and emotion into the crisp Icelandic air. Every\
  \ time it seems to be ending, another amateur production begins elsewhere - a nearly\
  \ endless delightful screech. \nIt finally dies down, and - elated and emotional\
  \ - I trudge back to the bus. Heart full of joy, eyes full of wonder, ears ringing,\
  \ belly full of Icelandic donuts, pockets happily empty. Unexpectedly - and in the\
  \ midst of spectacle both natural and manmade, I\u2019ve found relief."
