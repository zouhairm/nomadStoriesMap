Text: "Several years ago, I went to the festival \"The Sun, Joy, Beauty\" in Bulgaria,\
  \ the city of Nessebar. I am an artist from Siberia and I participated in the competition\
  \ of open-air works.\n  When I arrived in Bulgaria, my baggage was lost. Phone discharged.\
  \ I cried all the way from the airport to the hotel. After bitter tears, I calmed\
  \ down and promised myself that this journey would be the best!\n  After my arrival,\
  \ two days passed and my baggage was found. I was happy and cheerful went to the\
  \ coast to draw. It was like a fairy tale! Around me were  ancient temples made\
  \ of stone, the waves beat on the rocky shore, white boats floated and the bagpiper\
  \ played ... I painted it all in my painting and took fourth place in the competition!\n\
  \  When I arrived in Bulgaria, it felt like I was in my home, to a warm and cozy\
  \ place, where there was always warmth, many friendly people and juicy fruits! I\
  \ would never have thought that Bulgaria could make such an impression on me! This\
  \ country was like a grandmother, who cared about me!\nAfter the contest, I had\
  \ a week left to study the terrain and culture of local peoples. I went to the Archaeological\
  \ Museum of the city of Nessebar, asked the Bulgarians about the local life, I learned\
  \ how the Bulgarian folk costume looks and how ceramic items are made. I went on\
  \ an excursion to Burgas, Sofia, to the castle of the Romanian queen. I didn`t know\
  \ what  was so special about Bulgaria, but it seemed  that everything was unique!\n\
  \  Sometimes I ran to the sea at night and talked with people who were sitting on\
  \ the beach. They told about local customs, about legends and peculiarities of mentality.\
  \ For example, in Bulgaria when a person nods his head vertically, this means that\
  \ he says no, and when he nods his head, horizontally, it means that he says yes.\
  \ In Russia, everything is completely the opposite! Many Russian words are similar\
  \ to Bulgarian in pronunciation and spelling, but have a completely different meaning,\
  \ because of this there are many reasons for laughter... People in Bulgaria are\
  \ very open and friendly, their charisma fascinates and delights. Every person I\
  \ met was like a piece of a magic puzzle from which it was necessary to assemble\
  \ all of Bulgaria.\n  Also in my journey there was a place for romance. Next to\
  \ my hotel room was a guy from Hungary. When I saw him, I immediately fell in love.\
  \ Only he lived with his parents and we could not constantly communicate with him,\
  \ so we wrote each other letters and threw them at each other on the balconies.\
  \ Six years have passed, and I still keep his letters.\n  I didn`t expect to find\
  \ so many interesting things in Bulgaria! During that time I lost my baggage , fell\
  \ in love with a Hungarian, found new friends and learned a lot about a stunning\
  \ country, whose culture has been preserved to the present! I am grateful that this\
  \ trip was in my life and I saw another beautiful country of this world!"
