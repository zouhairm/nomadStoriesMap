Text: "Bars with craft brews, tango shows and milongas, burger shops, lively pubs\
  \ and ballads, and restaurants serving from typical chorizo steak the local wines\
  \ to dishes from around the world. This is just a little of what the great Buenos\
  \ Aires has to offer. I could not exploring the city without experience the authentic\
  \ \"Argentinian way of night\u201D, especially in the Palermo neighborhood, best\
  \ known for concentrating the nightlife. \nWhen night falls, the neighborhood turns\
  \ into a \u201Cparty\u201D, young people giggling and drinking everywhere. It has\
  \ ballads of all kinds, such as Glam for the LGBT public or the Brazilian nightclub\
  \ Maluco Beleza - where division of musical style lies in each floor of the place:\
  \ the ground floor is for Argentines and the second for Brazilians, every one enjoying\
  \ their taste. On top of that, the nightlife starts only around 2:00 AM! While in\
  \ Brazil we, usually, leave at 10:00 PM, in there, all the bars just have only half\
  \ a dozen people.\nWishing to go out at night over the weekend, but no friends in\
  \ the city on that moment, I've chosen to go with the Pub Crawl. An \"alcoholic\"\
  \ tour that takes you to meet four different bars and one ballad during the night.\
  \ There is an initial meeting place where each person in the group gets an identification\
  \ wristband and move from one point to another either by walking or by a taxi organized\
  \ by the guides. In each bar the participants are welcomed whit a chupito and, in\
  \ the end, free access to the ballad. If you've never heard of the chupito, it's\
  \ worth to experiment! It's a hot drink, like tequila.\nEvery day of the week, the\
  \ Pub Crawl provides a different programming, varying also the prices - which always\
  \ goes from 150 to 250 pesos (equal to $4,00 to $7,00). The initiative exists in\
  \ several cities of the world, with a vocation for entertaining interaction, this\
  \ type of tourism boasts a power of socialization that surpasses any language barrier.\n\
  I tested the Pub Crawl tour for two days. The first day, I had LGBT programming,\
  \ because of the gay parade that happened in the city the same day. Maybe I was\
  \ not lucky in this night, because I went out in a group of - not so lively - 10\
  \ people to not so cozy bars. However, on the second day, the tour amazed me. When\
  \ I left with my friend at 11:00 PM, tired of the intense day, I confess that we\
  \ lacked courage. Then luck turned in our favor and we got back to the hotel at\
  \ 5 AM having fun, with Minnie's headbands on and glowing sticks.\nThat night, I\
  \ met the Vavok, Burkina and Chupitos bars, with all sort of games and drinks. And\
  \ I ended up in the Lolita club, dancing to the sound of Latin songs that I hardly\
  \ knew but they would not let me stay still, with a good surprise when playing Brazilian\
  \ funk! Already in matter of flirting, you will not see the famous flirting that\
  \ happens in Brazil... The Argentines talk more than kiss. \nFrom the many people\
  \ I have met, I will remember of Matias, an Argentine lawyer, who in a conversation\
  \ told me when he has been in Germany and had been threatened by Turks for exposing\
  \ his liberal opinion. Pedro, Brazilian young, who went to spend the holiday in\
  \ Buenos Aires with his friends, like me. And Fede, an Argentine who has visited\
  \ Porto Seguro (Brazil) and became enthusiastic to visit other beautiful places\
  \ from where I was born, Bahia.\nThe most outstanding memory of this experience,\
  \ however, is the feeling of night out in good company and safely in a city beforehand\
  \ unknown. Experiencing a new culture and adapting to it always a difficult task\
  \ but challenging. The beauty of the town with its street lights at the night, the\
  \ chats in the pubs, the dancing songs and the new friendships left nostalgic memories\
  \ of Buenos Aires."
