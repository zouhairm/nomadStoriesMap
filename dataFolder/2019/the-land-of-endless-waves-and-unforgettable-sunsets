Text: "One day I woke up and realized that life is too short to wait so I bought plane\
  \ ticket, I packed my surfboard and decided to see what is out there waiting for\
  \ me. \nMy story begins in the capital city Lisbon with very kind locals who had\
  \ helped me finding the right bus which took me to my not so expensive and lovely\
  \ hostel. While I was driving I was falling in love with unique architecture mixed\
  \ with old, gothic and brand-new buildings that in Lisbon fit together perfectly.\
  \ The city lies beside the river Tejo and is surrounded by seven hills, also seven\
  \ different view points where you can observe the beauty of this city. If you are\
  \ there, you also have to visit the oldest part with narrow streets named Alfama\
  \ and try their local seafood with good Portuguese wine and meanwhile listen to\
  \ their traditional live music called Fado. Nearby small, historic town Sintra took\
  \ my breath away and for a moment I felt like being a part of this authentic city\
  \ which has elements of fairy tale. Beside being a tourist, my purpose there was\
  \ also finding new surf spots and catching the swell. I packed my board and took\
  \ a train to a place called Cascais, I caught some good waves there, had the best\
  \ ice-cream in my life and met some friendly local surfers who invited me to go\
  \ on the road with them. Without any hesitation I went and I will never regret my\
  \ decision because they took me to the most wonderful places I\u2019ve been so far\
  \ \u2013 Cabo de Roca, the most western point of Europe; the place where the sky\
  \ kisses the sea and where are only countless miles of Atlantic ocean. While we\
  \ were waiting for the sunset there, and I have to say that the view on cliffs was\
  \ beyond beautiful, somehow I found myself out there in that limitless picture I\u2019\
  ve always dreamt of. On the way to Porto we also visited Ericeira, Nazare and Peniche\
  \ which are literally paradises for people who like water sports or maybe just enjoying\
  \ lying on the beach with cold Super Bock. Ancient town Coimbra has a lot of nice\
  \ places including uniqueness and unbelievably beautiful landscapes, hills, valleys\
  \ all around. We also stopped in Aveiro or I would rather say Portuguese Venice\
  \ where they have the best fish market and all traditional food you can imagine,\
  \ made with a lot of love because it tastes very good. When we reached Porto it\
  \ didn\u2019t impress me from the very first sight as for example Lisbon. A lot\
  \ of ruined buildings made total disharmony with all this wonderful views all over\
  \ the horizon. However, it has its own authentic, charming colour and they have\
  \ the best wine, called Porto. The architecture differs from capital\u2019s one,\
  \ but you can feel how every building here has a story. On my luck the same day\
  \ as friends had to leave me on my road I found really cheap flight (only 15$) from\
  \ there to the south of Portugal \u2013 Faro, even though the public transport in\
  \ Portugal is really fast and not so expensive I\u2019ve learnt to always look for\
  \ the plane tickets first, trust me because you can be surprise. When I finally\
  \ reached the south of the country I was amazed by its own magical charm. I really\
  \ enjoyed those wonderful, not so crowded, sandy beaches, kindness of Portuguese\
  \ people because you are welcome wherever you go and majestic sunset views with\
  \ ocean breeze in Cabo de Sao Vincente. \nHowever, it has been a really long time\
  \ since my trip to this magnificent country of art but yet when I close my eyes\
  \ at night I can still feel Lisbon vibes, climate filled with sunlight and warmth,\
  \ I am able to hear wild noises from Jardim Zoologico or sound of smooth jazz music\
  \ from Belem. Once in a while I feel how the tide carries us together while we are\
  \ waiting for the next wave out there. I still dream those unforgettable landscapes\
  \ of ocean shores, colourful streets of Porto and the taste of Pastel de Nata. \n\
  Now and then I am still there."
