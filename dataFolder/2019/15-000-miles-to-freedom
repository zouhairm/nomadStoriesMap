Text: "With a blank journal in my hand and a scratch-off map of the U.S., I hit the\
  \ road with a lofty goal to visit the contiguous 48 states. It was an odd time to\
  \ embark on such a journey, as the recent divisive political climate was threatening\
  \ my love for this country. What was happening on a macro level echoed in personal\
  \ life too, as I grappled with the realization that I had been living each day just\
  \ trying to survive circumstances no one should ever have to go through, but sadly\
  \ far too many have. I was lucky to rid myself of a toxic past but knew that healing\
  \ would take more than time; it required distance.\n\nSo began my epic road trip,\
  \ taking me from the Northeast's tallest mountain to the South Dakota Badlands,\
  \ the neon lights of the Santa Monica pier, and back to the honking sounds of New\
  \ York City. I've always loved to travel and knew this was going to be an incredible\
  \ journey; what I didn't expect to find was a renewed sense of self, safety, and\
  \ freedom. Out on the open road, as the wind blew in my hair, I didn't feel a rush\
  \ of adrenaline. Instead, for the first time in a long time, I felt at peace. \n\
  \nSurprisingly, it was in Nebraska where I found my greatest zen. The plains were\
  \ so flat, the wheat fields stretched for miles; the sky so blue and omnificent,\
  \ it looked as though I was inside of a Thomas Kincade landscape. I pulled over\
  \ and ran through a field of sunflowers, and laughed so hard when it was later made\
  \ apparent that I had become the talk of the town by doing so.\n\nThe nature around\
  \ me was so calming, and as the odometer increased, so did my admiration for the\
  \ terrain and beauty of this country. I never knew how magnificent the rainbowed\
  \ valleys of Arizona were or how the glow of Mount Rushmore at night could light\
  \ a spark of patriotism in even the worst of critics. For me, this was so much more\
  \ than a road trip, it was an awakening of my mind and soul.\n\nWho knew that sometimes\
  \ the antidote you're looking for isn't measured in teaspoons or milligrams, but\
  \ instead in miles? For me, it took 15,000 miles to freedom, and I'm never looking\
  \ back."
