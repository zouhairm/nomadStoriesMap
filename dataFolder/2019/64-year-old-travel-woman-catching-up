Text: "I used to travel. I traveled all over Europe, Mexico, Israel and more in my\
  \ 20's. Then I got married and had children. It's the same old story. So many of\
  \ my women friends experienced the same. I was brave and traveled independently\
  \ or with one friend. Some of my friends took semester's aboard or traveled with\
  \ teen groups. But the story repeats for all of us. Be Mom; with joy. stay at home\
  \ and always put the family first. \nI did this happily for 35 years.  I raised\
  \ two wonderful children, Have a perfect Grandson with another on the way, but always\
  \ I repressed my wanderlust. I watched Anthony Bordain, other travel shows.. read\
  \ travel stories on the internet.. but remained at mostly at home in rural Minnesota.\
  \ I was happy for many of my friends that could afford to travel and went to places\
  \ I yearned to see, but felt I'd never get there.\nIn the mean time, my Son Jesse\
  \ inherited my wanderlust. At 17, he started to take international trips. He did\
  \ this through college and afterwards works for 3/4 of the year and travels every\
  \ winter for 4 months. He has been to every continent accept Antarctica. That might\
  \ me next winter. He posts photos from Peru, S E Asia, Europe, Australia, Israel,\
  \ you name it and he seems to have been there.\nI make a bit on money on the side\
  \ making jewelry and in the past gave him 1/2 towards his travel, but after a lifetime\
  \ of spending on my kids, something changed in me.\nMy Husband has a small area\
  \ of comfort and isn't interested in traveling to exotic destinations. I started\
  \ to save.  (I thought maybe I can get in one more adventure before I retire and\
  \ can't afford it?). So this time, I'll go with a friend. He encouraged me. Seems\
  \ I'm the only one that stopped me from doing this all along.\nI always tell my\
  \ son how proud I am of how he travels and how happy it makes him. He encouraged\
  \ me to do the same. He asked what animals I like and I said Elephants, so he said,\
  \ go to Thailand and live on an elephant preserve for 3 weeks. It's cheap! \nNow\
  \ my son Jesse is proud of me, and is encouraging me to travel more.  He said, \"\
  what's the hurry\"; when I rattle off places I want to see.  I pointed out to him\
  \ that I\"m just getting older and no one knows for sure how long I can travel.\
  \ I had heart surgery two year ago and other health scares.  He totally understood.\n\
  I mentioned this to my girlfriend Lucinda and she has experience the same. So we\
  \ started to fantasize and asked each other where should we go?\nI blurted out \
  \ North Vietnam! She said lets do it and we are. We are going in 1 week for 14 days\
  \ and are going to  hike in Sapa, sail on Ha Long bay and fly to Angar Wat in Cambodia\
  \ for 2 days.  We are \"going for it\".  A wonderful fantasy adventure.\nMy son\
  \ said I should go to Portugal. He loves it there and today I saw you're contest.\
  \ Who knows what could happen.\nLife goes quickly, one should live not only for\
  \ their families, but for adventures!"
