Text: "On a recent trip to Bahamian Out Island Eleuthera, we decided to celebrate\
  \ one of our party's birthdays with a drive to to the southernmost beach on the\
  \ island, Lighthouse Beach.   We never made it there, as the last 5 miles of \"\
  road\" was just broken boulders and cave-like potholes, much too rough for a 10+\
  \ year old transit van to travel.  We reversed out of the road where another vehicle\
  \ had broken down and been abandoned, and travelled back up the island along the\
  \ Atlantic coast.  A few miles north, we passed a small idyllic B&B overlooking\
  \ the ocean, and out popped the home's namesake, Rose.  She hailed us down, asked\
  \ what we were looking for, and urged us to let her lead us to a beach nearby -\
  \ the most beautiful, she said, on the island.  She jumped in her little sedan,\
  \ and off she went, waving us to follow.  The road to our new destination was rough\
  \ but passable, and then we arrived upon  White Sand Beach, hidden gem of Eleuthera.\
  \  Rose accompanied us to the trail, hugged us all, and, with a sparkling smile,\
  \ left us to enjoy.  \nHere, we also  met a young family of 4, who had sailed down\
  \ from Massachusetts and anchored in the Caribbean bay on the other side of the\
  \ island from White Sand Beach when they also had been rescued by Rose as they were\
  \ traversing the island in search of the Atlantic side for a day of parasailing..she\
  \ picked them all up in a couple of trips and drove them across as well.\nAfter\
  \ a day of enjoying this otherwise deserted beach with the sailing family, we packed\
  \ up and travelled north, passing Rose's with a wave and smile, and ended the day\
  \ at inland Ocean Hole for a final swim, returning once down the coast to pick up\
  \ the sailing family who were also walking up to enjoy the Hole.\nA very special\
  \ day all in all, compliments of Rose - one of the best of the many examples of\
  \ some of the friendliest people in the world that Eleuthera will always be remembered\
  \ for.\n[Note:  this story would be accompanied by a picture of Rose, parasailers,\
  \ and a small map of the area with places mentioned highlighted]"
