Text: 'We(me and my good friend Gigi) are italian guys,especially we call us Sardinian
  travellers.We were driving through Latvia''s routes when we thought to change our
  destination.So we leaved the first route to go into the nature.We were listen to
  some kind of music looking to the factory,cows,people,lakes,trees.... when something
  strange happened.On the radio we became to listen Sardinian folk music and this
  was so cool cause we were so far away from our beloved Island!It was like a dream,also
  today I and Gigi we aren''t sure of what we thought about it,just 3 -4 minutes of
  craziness!That day i remember as my best travel.Gigi too thinks the same and when
  we go out together to drink a beer we Always remember about out Latvia''s experience
  so cool and crazy.It was absolutely  abnormal,in the nature listening to our folk
  music inspirated by the nature too,our style of life and old stories.So i advise
  all to travel in Latvia where people is simple and smart,nature is fantastic and
  food is really good!I also advise all to visit my Island,one of the 20 regions of
  Italy but certainly the better one with sea,nature,mountains,Nuraghi,histories of
  giants and Janas,superlative food and amazing people!Travel man,travel as you can!
