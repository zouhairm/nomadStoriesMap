Text: "Had I ever dreamed of traveling to Africa to visit the tribal people? Although\
  \ it was something I had read about in magazines like National Geographic, my desires\
  \ were more superficial. Yes, it would be amazing to go on safari and claim that\
  \ I had been on the other side of the world doing humanitarian work. But the local\
  \ connection that I made there far exceeded my expectations.\n\nI met my fellow\
  \ humanitarians and the leader of our organization at the airport. On the first\
  \ morning after arriving, our small group voyaged by jeep from the city of Nairobi\
  \ to a Maasai school some miles away to deliver books and give a presentation on\
  \ feminine hygiene to the older girls. The road was bumpier than any I had been\
  \ on before, and the ride was long. I found myself anxious and nervous to meet these\
  \ local children. Would they find us strange? How would we interact with their limited\
  \ knowledge of English and our non-existent Maa language abilities? \n\nWhen we\
  \ arrived, however, my doubts and fears were placated. Standing on both sides of\
  \ the pathway leading inside the compound were the colorfully dressed grades of\
  \ the Maasai school\uF02Dand they were singing. With the clear voices that only\
  \ children possess, they repeated a simple tune reciting, \u201CWelcome, visitors,\
  \ welcome! We have waited for you long time\u2026\u201D in a dual phrasal song in\
  \ which the genuine excitement of the message was transparent. Our facilitator informed\
  \ us that the garments that they were wearing were their very best clothing, and\
  \ not their average-everyday attire. They were well-adorned in the beautiful beaded\
  \ jewelry hand-made for occasions such as this. \n\nThere are no words to properly\
  \ describe the feeling of complete and utter reception from strangers whom you have\
  \ never met.\n\nFirst, they took us to their library. It was a single ten by ten-foot\
  \ room in their small wooden school house with almost all of the shelves bare. Those\
  \ that were occupied held torn and well-worn magazines or paperbacks. The few textbooks\
  \ they had were outdated and small in number; yet, the children strived to interact\
  \ with us in English, and I was surprised by their ability to communicate. How could\
  \ they have learned so well with only a single teacher and ramshackle books such\
  \ as these? Even the youngest kindergarten-aged children had at least a few words\
  \ to say as they commented on our long hair and the extraterritorial colors. \n\n\
  When we brought out of the jeep the boxes of various books that had been collected\
  \ through donation in Utah, the children were ecstatic. As we unpacked the boxes,\
  \ they helped us deliver the books to their homes on the shelves with speedy reverence,\
  \ taking great care to handle them gently. These books\uF02D books which some other\
  \ child had mistreated or forgotten\uF02Dwere a comprehendible treasure to the students\
  \ of this Maasai school.  \n\nNext, they showed us the land the school inhabited;\
  \ it was a small area that included the schoolhouse, a tiny garden, a cooking and\
  \ slaughter house, and a worship hall. For lunch they fed us fresh goat roasted\
  \ on a spit and placed on large banana leaves as we sat in a circle outside and\
  \ they watched us interestedly. Afterwards, they brought us to an open area where\
  \ several traditional dances were performed. To my surprise, we were pulled in by\
  \ friendly hands to join in with the movements and singing that was singular to\
  \ this small school near a village in Kenya. \n\nWhen it came time for our presentation,\
  \ the words that had originally seemed awkward or strange came out as fluidly as\
  \ a prayer. We explained the importance of feminine hygiene and bodily autonomy,\
  \ and these young girls who were beginning the stages that would deem them women\
  \ had never been told that they had a right to their own body and their own life.\
  \ They sang to us afterwards in grateful songs with voices of angels. And as we\
  \ painted the walls of their worship hall and let them braid our hair, I wondered\
  \ if there could be any other place where the most human of connections were made\
  \ without the use of vocal conversation"
