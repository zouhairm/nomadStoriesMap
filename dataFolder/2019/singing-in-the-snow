Text: "Mountains always have stories to tell. When you have countless footprints superimposed\
  \ on top of the other, you don't have lack of characters too. People of India visit\
  \ the Himalayas to lose those characters, more specifically to lose their footprints\
  \ in snow though the stories remain untouched, pure and untold. My story too started\
  \ somewhere I don't know and was going well untold. Neither had it any characters,\
  \ nor had it me in it. For someone who has been to the Himalayas, he himself is\
  \ the story. He himself becomes the story. So was my case.\n\nWe started as a group\
  \ of 7 literally sailing over the topsy-turvy path (a road made out of rocks) from\
  \ Gangtok to Lachung. After exploring the Himalayas through the Himachal region,\
  \ this was my turn to taste its beauty from the North Eastern State of India, Sikkim.\
  \ Though I was there with a friend, I traveled with no strings attached. The group\
  \ of 5 from Kolkata was in a whole different world and hence they didn't even appear\
  \ in cameo roles in my story. My friend was travel-sick, a word which surprisingly\
  \ isn\u2019t the antonym of homesick (what an irony!). So literally there I was\
  \ standing in the middle of Yumthang Valley, roughly 11,600 ft high, during the\
  \ coldest time of the year! Christmas was coming. And the bells were ringing.\n\n\
  The day before I reached Yumthang Valley was the coldest with temperature dropping\
  \ up to -12\xB0C. Snow showered love on me that night and I was more than excited\
  \ to dance out of sheer joy. The home stay at Lachung was our den for the night.\
  \ My blanket shivered more than me and the hiss of the heater couldn't even entertain\
  \ me. I was still stuck with the stars shining over my head as if there was no tomorrow.\
  \ One of them was taking a solo trip over the snow-capped mountains which completely\
  \ filled my 360 degree vision range. \"If someone could solo travel over those mountains\
  \ on a December night, that star could be me\", I thought and smiled secretly before\
  \ falling on to the dead cold bed.\n\nThe next day was the day I sang in the snow.\
  \ It was something I had never done before. The temperature was -5\xB0C, wind was\
  \ blowing. It was more difficult than I imagined. Being a full-time musician, I\
  \ anyway took it as a challenge to test my singing in such adverse conditions. As\
  \ soon as I completed singing, I got a fan. A lady solo traveler from Kolkata wearing\
  \ a dark red jacket and curiously looking for any drop of beauty she missed even\
  \ while talking to me. The big man-sized round rocks wearing white caps were my\
  \ audience before she peeped in to clap her hands. She suggested the hashtag #HighAltitudeSinging.\
  \ I found that really interesting and uploaded the video on Instagram right away.\
  \ In a way, you could say I took singing to great heights. (Ah! That joke hurts\
  \ I know)\n\nVisiting the Himalayas in December was on first place an out-of-comfort-zone\
  \ thing for me. Singing in the snow was no less than icing on the cake! Especially\
  \ when you had people back home trying to discourage the idea of travelling during\
  \ extreme cold weather, it indeed was a big boost for my self-confidence to have\
  \ even sung in that condition.\n\nBudget friendly travel, less crowd, blocked roads,\
  \ subzero temperature - I truly fell in love with off-season trips!"
