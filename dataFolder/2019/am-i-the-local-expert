Text: "After hiking up a steep, dusty path for half an hour, the five of us perched\
  \ on the edge of the abandoned, graffiti-covered cement bunker known as the Lanikai\
  \ Pillbox, staring at an awe-striking view of the hues of blue Pacific Ocean dotted\
  \ with two nature-laden islands. The midday Hawaiian sun warmed our skin while the\
  \ trade winds cooled the heat down to the perfect temperature.\n\n\u201CThis bunker\
  \ is called a pillbox. The U.S. military used it during World War II to spot incoming\
  \ invaders, because, after the Pearl Harbor bombing on December 7, 1941, they wanted\
  \ to ensure that Oahu wouldn\u2019t have another attack.\u201D\n\nI spewed out tons\
  \ of relevant information without a thought, because I was the expert. Instead of\
  \ asking questions to others, these Californians were asking me questions.\n\n\u201C\
  Can people go to those islands?\u201D Someone asked, gesturing towards the two green\
  \ specks.\n\n\u201CYou can kayak to Moku Nui,\u201D I said, pointing to the island\
  \ on the left, \u201Cbut it takes a couple of hours, and it can be tough depending\
  \ on the wave size. If you look, you can see the wave crests today \u2013 see the\
  \ lines of fluffy white? That means that the waves are large and kayaking out will\
  \ be difficult.\u201D\n\nWe looked at two kayakers paddling out in their bright\
  \ yellow boat. They weren\u2019t making much progress.\n\n\u201CWhen you finally\
  \ get there though, there\u2019s an easy hike around the island, where you can see\
  \ tidepools and another one of the main Hawaiian Islands,\u201D I explained from\
  \ personal experience.\n\n\u201CAnd the one on the right, Moku Iki,\u201D I continued,\
  \ \u201Cis military property, so no one can go there. Rumor has it that the two\
  \ islands were connected previously, but erosion wore them down.\u201D\n\nFour stunned\
  \ pairs of eyes stared at me and seemed to blink in sync.\n\n\u201CSarah, how do\
  \ you know all of that?\u201D\n\nI paused. I tilted my head in confusion and thought,\
  \ how do I know all of that?\n\n\u201CI don\u2019t know. I guess it comes with growing\
  \ up on Oahu.\u201D I looked down (partly in thought and partly in embarrassment\
  \ of my copious amounts of mysteriously obtained knowledge) and subconsciously traced\
  \ my fingers over the word \u201Caloha\u201D that had been graffitied onto the pillbox.\n\
  \nThat single term, \u201Caloha,\u201D encapsulates so much of Hawaii life. Most\
  \ people know it as meaning simply \u201Chello\u201D and \u201Cgoodbye,\u201D but\
  \ that Hawaiian word captures much more.\n\nCompared to its translation of \u201C\
  hello,\u201D \u201Caloha\u201D has a more welcoming connotation. While \u201Chello\u201D\
  \ is used as a formality when meeting an unfamiliar colleague, the same cannot be\
  \ said of \u201Caloha.\u201D Why? \u201CAloha\u201D connotes compassion, kindness,\
  \ and even love.\n\nPerhaps the more comprehendible phrase is \u201Caloha spirit.\u201D\
  \ One exemplifies aloha spirit through the smallest actions. Letting someone into\
  \ your lane when he or she signals. Giving a sandwich to a homeless person. Respecting\
  \ the beauty of cultural differences both in Hawaii\u2019s metaphoric saimin bowl-mix\
  \ of cultures and in the wider world.\n\nExpressing true aloha spirit is an altruistic\
  \ behavior, one that instinctually gives the needs of others, animals, and even\
  \ nature priority over one\u2019s own. For most people, aloha spirit manifests subconsciously;\
  \ it just seems like the right thing to do. But if we dig deeper, the reason is\
  \ simple: harmony.\n\nBy letting someone into your lane rather than speeding up,\
  \ you could prevent an accident. By giving a homeless woman a sandwich, she can\
  \ enjoy her first meal in days. And by respecting other cultures, if we think big,\
  \ the whole world could significantly improve. These simple acts of aloha spirit\
  \ can create a world filled with more harmony and less chaos. Each subconscious\
  \ good deed has the potential to have a further and greater impact on another precious\
  \ aspect of the world \u2013 whether that is another human, animal, or natural landscape.\n\
  \nLooking back on our descent down the Lanikai Pillbox trail, I realized that as\
  \ I expertly guided the group down, I also showed aloha spirit towards Hawaii\u2019\
  s nature. In between my slips down the steep slope, I picked up several pieces of\
  \ trash, including a Heineken bottle cap and a Ziploc bag. The decision to gather\
  \ these items wasn\u2019t conscious. I was compelled by aloha spirit."
