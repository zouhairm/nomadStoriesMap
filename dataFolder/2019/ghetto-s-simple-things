Text: "\u201CAnna! Come, I want to visit my mum and have dinner there!\u201D \nThat\u2019\
  s how I ended up at the back of Richad\u2019s motorbike. A 1964 red Vespa, an Italian\
  \ jewel trying to find its way in the busy streets of Yogyakarta, Jogja for those\
  \ who know\u2026\n\nIt was already dark when we arrived at the bridge, but I could\
  \ clearly see the big white entrance pillars so characteristic of Jogja, proudly\
  \ announcing in black capital letters, \u201CSayidan\u201D. The river is a border\
  \ between the old \u201Ckampung\u201D and the rest of the city, separating the historical\
  \ heart from the new urbanised area.\nThe first thing that caught my attention was\
  \ the massive gothic church that firmly stood in the middle of people\u2019s home.\
  \ \n\u201CThis architecture, here?!\u201D I thought, surprised. But according to\
  \ the Indonesian history, the Dutch occupation and the several migrations that have\
  \ plagued the country, this sacred Christian building just made sense.\n\nAs we\
  \ were going deeper into Sayidan, the narrow streets, locally called \u201Cgangs\u201D\
  , were getting tighter. The old Vespa and its big curvy bottom struggled to pass\
  \ through them. Everywhere was a great profusion of colours and drawings, not one\
  \ centimeter of wall or pavement was left untouched!! It felt like in Brazil, in\
  \ the middle of a colourful favela.\nSuddenly, the noisy Italian engine stopped,\
  \ continuing on freewheels, we were arriving. Every house looked so compact! Stuck\
  \ to each other along this gang, like an infinite, long and narrow path to nowhere\u2026\
  \n\nRichad\u2019s house was painted black and red, the current president\u2019s\
  \ colours, Joko Widodo. I couldn\u2019t resist to ask: \u201CSo here, you can paint\
  \ your house according to your political convictions?\u201D His answer was as simple\
  \ as the Javanese philosophy is: \u201COf course!! You can use any colour you want\
  \ as long as you like it!! Why not?!\u201D I just thought that would be impossible\
  \ in Europe!\nAs he invited me to come in, I banged my head in the door frame, \u201C\
  Damn!!\u201D. He couldn\u2019t stop scoffing at me but explained to me then that\
  \ it was a traditional building trick to force people to show respect when entering\
  \ someone\u2019s home. \u201CNow I\u2019m sure you\u2019ll bend your head!!\u201D\
  \nI was experiencing surprises and cultural discoveries at every step of what was\
  \ a routine family visit\u2026\n\nThe house was long, narrow and had low ceiling,\
  \ basically furnished. I still remember Richad\u2019s amusement as he told me: \u201C\
  It\u2019s like living in a bus you know!\u201D\nWe did pass through a few rooms,\
  \ some with mattresses on the floor, obviously bedrooms. Then we got to the kitchen,\
  \ at the very end of the \u201Cbus\u201D.\n\nThree women were seating here, busy\
  \ chatting and laughing out loud. Richad introduced me to his mum, then his aunties,\
  \ Santi and Tuti. His aunties were wearing hijabs, but all were smocking as Indonesian\
  \ men do!!\nI knew straight away I was in front of charismatic women. But, without\
  \ one minute, Santi was already up, insisting to lend me her chair and Richad\u2019\
  s mum filled up plates with a huge amount of rice and Javanese food: \u201CPlease\
  \ Anna, eat.\u201D My mouth couldn\u2019t believe how delicious the food was!! Or\
  \ was it the way they did naturally offered it to me? \nEverybody was so concerned\
  \ about my well being, even the temperature of my glass of water!! \u201CYou prefer\
  \ it cold or tempered?\u201D\n\nSo here I was. In the middle of a ghetto in Yogyakarta,\
  \ in the tiniest house, laughing to Javanese jokes I couldn\u2019t understand at\
  \ all, but their happiness was simply viral\u2026 Smoking with my friend, his Christian\
  \ mum and his two Muslim aunties, all of us under the benevolent eye of a gothic\
  \ church.\n\nIndonesia. A unique, crazy, cultural, religious and ethnic melting\
  \ pot that shows us that we can all live together in peace as long as the only concern\
  \ is to treat a stranger, or your neighbour, as a member of your family. Wherever\
  \ he is from, whatever he believes in and whoever he wants for president. That's\
  \ what I discovered that night...\n\nMatur nuwun Indonesia merdeka. (Thank you free\
  \ Indonesia in Javanese dialect.)"
