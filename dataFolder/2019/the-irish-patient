Text: "Since very child, little Rufus already projected the signals of a human being\
  \ \nwho  does  not  despair  under  any  situation.  He  loved  a  lot  to  take\
  \  care  of  the  sheep \naround the green and windy hills of Limerick. When his\
  \ grandfather left him alone with \nthe  curly-haired  animals,  he  used  to  entertain\
  \  himself  by  naming  each  one  of  them. \nAfter at night,  he  repeated  the\
  \ ritual of counting  sheep... his  own sheep.  However,  in \norder  to  make \
  \ the  process  funnier, he  matched  the  names  of  the  creatures  with  their\
  \ \nassigned  numbers.  So  the  71  sheep  were  all  identified because  Benny\
  \ the  Kid \nappreciated them in the same way and quantity.\nUnfortunately for O\xB4\
  \ Sully family and its farm, one biblical storm occurred on \nLimerick by the winter\
  \ of 1940. With almost no available resources at home, he decided \nto  look for\
  \ job so as to economically help his parents and brothers. A distant relative \n\
  offered  him  to  be  a  trucker  for  the  British  Army  during  the  Second \
  \ World  War.  He \nmostly had to transport injured privates who returned from the\
  \ battle line to their homes \nin  Belfast  and  surroundings.  This  is  the  time\
  \  when  Rufus  grew  up  by force  when  he \nknew  day  after  day  the  dark\
  \  and  incoherent  side  of  life.  while  driving  and  hearing \nsoldiers  testimonies,\
  \  he  always  paid  attention  to  the  regional  landscapes  and  planned \nwhich\
  \ crop he would bring to his farm, once this was ready so start cultivating again.\
  \ \nBen was specially attracted by the softness and properties of barley.\nBy the\
  \ end of the war, in 1945, he suddenly grew up in romantic affairs. Like \na  typical\
  \  Irish,  he  enjoyed  boozing,  although  he  preferred  wine  to  beer.  Therefore,\
  \ \ntaking  advantage  he  had  been  sent  to  the  south  of  Italy  to  collect\
  \  allied  released \nprisoners,  he  visited  one  vineyard  which  had  not  been\
  \  damaged  because  of  the \nexplosions. That day, fate put in front of him the\
  \ woman who later would become his \nwoman. \nIn one side of the road, Rufus spot\
  \ a tall but harmonically shaped woman. This \nblonde  was  wearing a  long  dusty\
  \  black  overcoat.  She  was  mysteriously  hitch-hiking, \nshaking her right thumb\
  \ like in a hurry, often glancing at every direction. Rufus picked \nher  up with\
  \ no hesitation.  Apparently,  she  was  running  away from a  high  grade Nazi\
  \ \nofficer.  Tania  Schbabauer,  his  own  daughter  and  secretary  could  not\
  \  stand  that \nenvironment any longer. She was rushing to Sicily, where she would\
  \ hide in a cottage \nand change her identity if necessary.\nUnexpectedly, one person\
  \ joined Tania\u2019s despaired escape: at first, he only felt \nhis duty was to\
  \ help somehow this poor woman. However, after a few minutes of listen \nto  her\
  \  carefully,  Rufus  was  being  amazed  by  an  interior  strong  sensation. \
  \ Suddenly, \nneither work nor family mattered. For some reason, he supposed love\
  \ was commitment. \nHe really felt in love for the first time and decided to take\
  \ commitment to the highest \nlevel. \nThat night, when the whole crew of the military\
  \ truck was sleeping, Rufus and \nTania left the vehicle, stole a horse and made\
  \ their way to the south of the peninsula. \nThey changed  the  original  destiny\
  \  when  they  met  a  gipsy  couple  who  offered  some\nroom in their tiny borrowed\
  \ ship. They were sailing to Yugoslavia. As the two fugitives \nwere afraid of being\
  \ caught if they waited for the next crossing to Sicily, they had no \nother choice\
  \ than heading across the Adriatic Sea. When the four members of the craft \nreached\
  \  Yugoslavian  shore,  Tania  and  Rufus  settled  down  in  an  abandoned  chapel.\
  \ \nThey tried to make their living growing basil and barley. After a tough year\
  \ and a half, \npractically isolated and starved, they conceived a child. Goran\
  \ brought light and hope \nspecially to Rufus, who little by little was being disappointed\
  \ about marriage life and \nstarted to miss his relatives in Limerick. Three more\
  \ years went by. The time they were \nnot  working at  the farm,  the family  spent\
  \  it around the magic  of  chess. Tania taught. \nRufus learned. And little Goran\
  \ was witness of the eternal matches. At the end, the baby \ntook the game quite\
  \ seriously...\nTO BE CONTINUED..."
