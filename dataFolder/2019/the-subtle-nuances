Text: "Throwing yourself into the deep end is how I like to live and this past weekend\
  \ was no different.\nAs I flicked through an Israeli mother\u2019s family photos\
  \ on her iPad I contemplated how I arrived in this situation, on a coach full of\
  \ Israelis from Napier to Taupo. Hitchhiking has never been my thing but when an\
  \ opportunity arises I take it. Being without a vehicle or access to public transport\
  \ while living and working in rural NZ has it\u2019s struggles but it has pushed\
  \ my inventiveness for getting around. This is my second year in New Zealand after\
  \ moving from the big smoke in Sydney and I\u2019ve revelled in the journey it has\
  \ taken me on so far, the good and the bad. \n\nThe transition and culture shock\
  \ was full of surprises; vowel skewing and the ever obvious rivalry between countries\
  \ I learnt the slang, adapted and tried my hardest to experience as much as I could\
  \ of the culture and way of life, with a bit of healthy banter thrown in.\n\nNew\
  \ Zealand is one of the only countries that seems to be doing everything right to\
  \ amend the past and the contrast is great in terms of Australia and love the integration\
  \ of native tongue into everyday life. Kia ora, Morena and the small greetings that\
  \ don\u2019t seem like much make such a difference in keeping Te Reo alive and I\
  \ love the challenge of new languages.\n\nFinding a way to connect with someone\
  \ as intimately as I did on this coach was astonishing in my eyes as we couldn\u2019\
  t understand each other and every word I thought I knew was just a derivative of\
  \ French which was definitely not of the same meaning. Our only source of communication\
  \ was this iPad and sharing of photos and lives. The smiles and excitement we both\
  \ brought to each other was uplifting and as I start to pack up my possessions for\
  \ a new deep end experience I thank everyone I meet everyday, as even a quick G\u2019\
  day and smile in the morning from strangers passing by has given me a confidence\
  \ in community and humanity that surpasses what I had known before.\n\nAs the top\
  \ hits in Hebrew bounced around my ears, we climbed through the Ahimanawa ranges\
  \ and I was not only excited for the Hebrew lesson I was about to learn but the\
  \ adventure that awaited as I stepped off the coach into the unknown. Shalom."
