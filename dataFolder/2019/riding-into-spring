Text: "\u201CThey have raisins,\u201D Cathy said in a conspiratorial whisper, pointing\
  \ her head toward a shelf in the small convenience store. A mile off our main route,\
  \ we were in search of fare beyond the ever-present candy and snacks. \nBicycling\
  \ 50-plus miles a day hauling a tent, sleeping bag, cooking gear and clothes made\
  \ food important. Very important.\nIt was early April. We were bicycling the Natchez\
  \ Trace Parkway, 444 miles of non-commercial green beauty that runs from Natchez,\
  \ Mississippi to Nashville, Tennessee. Established in 1938, the Parkway is a ribbon\
  \ of hardtop that follows a centuries\u2019 old footpath. \nWhy were we doing this?\
  \ The call of the road. United in our love of adventure we set off, heading north,\
  \ towards home in New Hampshire after a year-long absence. The Trace did not disappoint.\
  \ No stores, no hotels, no restaurants, no commercial traffic. Just miles and miles\
  \ of beautiful trees and emerging flowers. And an occasional polite driver of an\
  \ automobile. To access the services of civilization we needed to exit off the Parkway\
  \ for \xBD mile or several miles. On a bicycle several miles is a long unpalatable\
  \ way which is why we were constantly on the look-out for food close by.\nThe one\
  \ convenience on the Parkway is campgrounds, delightfully free. The first night,\
  \ the campground was full. Looping around the campground fruitlessly, we shared\
  \ the momentary panic of \u201Cwhere will we go?\u201D as the next campground was\
  \ five hours\u2019 ride and the daylight was fading fast. A lovely man watched us\
  \ ride by again and invited us to perch on the edge of his site. The outstretched\
  \ hand of a stranger reminded us that help was often close at hand.\nFurther on,\
  \ at the Meriwether Lewis Campground, of Lewis and Clark fame, we found a tornado\
  \ warning in force. Our tent suddenly seemed rather insubstantial. Nothing to do\
  \ but set up camp. An offer of tea from a man with a British accent in an RV at\
  \ the next site over sounded very good indeed.\nThe tea was hot and delicious. Our\
  \ new friends plied us with stories from their 12 years on the road. We were startled\
  \ when the couple announced they were nudists, and asked if we were, too. \u201C\
  Nope, just two lesbians from New Hampshire,\u201D I said nervously. They offered\
  \ us a berth in their camper should a tornado come along. As we scooted out of the\
  \ camper, they asked \u201CAre you sure you aren\u2019t nudists?\u201D Luckily,\
  \ the storm passed us by. For many days, we ran into the nudists again and again.\
  \ \nWe were thrilled to discover a restaurant located close to the Trace for the\
  \ rare treat of a cooked lunch served at a table with chairs. We could not resist\
  \ the daily special of chicken dumplings with a choice of vegetables \u2013 corn,\
  \ black-eyed peas, potatoes. Cathy snagged the last piece of coconut cream pie.\
  \ After the enormous lunch, it was difficult to move. Usually I mount my bicycle\
  \ like I am getting on a horse. Left foot on pedal, right leg swung up and over\
  \ the immense pile of gear on the back rack. That day I could not lift my leg high\
  \ enough to swing it over. I resorted to a graceless slither over the bar on the\
  \ bike. The bike shook a bit as we headed off.  \nSoon, an elderly man, also on\
  \ a bicycle, roared down a small hill, waving as he passed, heading south. \u201C\
  Going to Natchez,\u201D he proclaimed as he whizzed by, a huge grin on his face.\
  \ Later at a rest stop, we ran into the man\u2019s sag wagon. A group of men had\
  \ worked together for many years at a power plant. Now deep in retirement, they\
  \ cycled the Trace every year, taking turns driving the support vehicle. The man\
  \ joyfully shouting \u201CGoing to Natchez\u201D came to represent an essential\
  \ attitude of joy, appreciation and determination.\nAlways heading north, we found\
  \ ourselves perpetually cycling into spring, repeatedly encountering the amazing\
  \ scent of lilacs ushering in the new season. Usually ephemeral, we discovered lilacs\
  \ again and again as we headed homeward. We rode into the enchantment of spring,\
  \ again and again every day."
