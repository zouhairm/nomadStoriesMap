Text: "In February of 2017, I was standing in North Sumatra, a large island in Western\
  \ Indonesia, my canon SLR dangling from my neck as I watched fog roll over a plentiful\
  \ and stunning landscape. Foreboding rain promised superb lighting for the five\
  \ photographers who accompanied me in attendance for an educational workshop. With\
  \ mud almost rising passed our heels, slow spits of moisture sprinkling our skin,\
  \ we knew that the act of freezing this moment in our minds eye was just as important\
  \ as leaning in for the correct click of our cameras. Beyond the rain, there was\
  \ something both ominous and enchanting that stood ineffable between us; the Sumatran\
  \ Wildlife Sanctuary was going to be  important.\n\nI have had two anxiety since\
  \ I was five years old. I had been afraid to leave the side of my mother in kindergarten,\
  \ in high school, and even a few instances in University. The minimal amount of\
  \ solace I found, was through writing. I found that I could express myself and connect\
  \ to those who felt oppressed by their own mental health issues. I wrote poetry,\
  \ short stories, and eventually, pursued journalism. \n\nI had begun volunteering\
  \ for an organization called Photographers Without Borders, a non-profit that captures\
  \ the positive actions of grassroot organizations around the world. I was asked\
  \ as a journalist to go to Sumatra Indonesia to accompany a photography workshop.\
  \ While participating in this workshop as a PWB ambassador, we would document to\
  \ activities of the Orangutan Information Centre, and investigate the effects the\
  \ palm oil industry has on deforestation. The offer was literally unlike anything\
  \ I've ever been asked to do, but there was a lot in the way stopping me: my fear\
  \ of the unknown. \n\nHaving an anxiety disorder means experiencing many of the\
  \ following associated symptoms on a day-to-day basis; catastrophic thinking, hot\
  \ flashes, shaking, heart palpitations, racing thoughts, a sensation of doom. Essentially,\
  \ you could call it the 'worst case scenario' disease. So my anxiety lens could\
  \ only zero in on all of the factors of fear that would await me; new people, a\
  \ new country, a new experience, with miniature threads of social anxiety and situational\
  \ panic attacks. The icing on the cake too, was this: I'd never been on a plane\
  \ before, and in order to land in the capital of Madan in Indonesia, I had to take\
  \ three separate flights that would total to 19 hours plus in the air. And on top\
  \ of that, finding my way around mysterious airports on several continents. Seemingly,\
  \ a lot was against me. \n\nIt would have been rational for me to reject an experience\
  \ so massively intimidating. But I know, deep within my heart, that it would be\
  \ likely for me to never receive an offer such as this again. Regret would haunt\
  \ me.\n\nI have never been so content about any risk I've taken in my life. The\
  \ leap I took into several frightening new experiences changed me as a photographer,\
  \ an activist, a writer, a living being. \n\nI climbed the mountains of Sumatra,\
  \ met locals, observed the poverty that drives the employment of palm oil workers,\
  \ and watched the acres that were purchased by the CEO of PWB that would turn into\
  \ the Sumatran Wildlife Sanctuary. I travelled down rivers, climbed steps that were\
  \ almost 90 degrees, ran from a mother orangutan trying to protect her babies, and\
  \ experienced the transfixing exhaustion of travel. And it is because of this incredible\
  \ leap into the darkness that I have tasted this thrill of travel and constant desire\
  \ to magnify the stories and voices of those of less privilege. \n\nI would love\
  \ to be able to do this again through attribution of photography and my writing\
  \ style. I would want to showcase the stories of lesser known to the general public,\
  \ and to shine a light of awareness into the world."
