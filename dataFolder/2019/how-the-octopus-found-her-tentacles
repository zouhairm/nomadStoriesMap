Text: "~The Foundation~\n\nAlmost exactly a year ago to the date my life was a mess.\
  \  Now when I say mess, we\u2019re talking runny ice cream cone pouring down your\
  \ arms in sticky ribbons; without a napkin in sight kind of mess.\n\nI realized\
  \ that I was constantly looking for any reason not to be alone. I didn\u2019t know\
  \ how to be alone, because I didn\u2019t know who I was when I was alone.  It was\
  \ a horrifying and shocking realization.   How was I supposed to go through life\
  \ without knowing who I was, what I stood for, what made me happy, what made me\
  \ passionate, and what I wanted out of life? I decided to take 6 months away from\
  \ anything companionship related, to spend time with myself and understand what\
  \ made me, me!\n\nFor about two years the idea of a backpacking trip through Europe\
  \ had been brewing.  In my head I imagined that it was going to be this incredible\
  \ and romantic story that I would share with the love of my life.  As it stood,\
  \ that was not my reality.  I had the time and the money right now, and I was sick\
  \ and tired of waiting for someone that I didn\u2019t even know.  In an impulsive\
  \ moment I booked my tickets, told my mother, and left 3 months later with my backpack\
  \ and hula-hoop in tow. \n\n~Barcelona~\n\nMy first destination was Barcelona, Spain.\
  \  Abba\u2019s \u201CDoes your Mother Know?\u201D was blaring through my earphones\
  \ as we touched down onto the asphalt. Once outside of the airport, I was looking\
  \ to hail a taxi when I was informed that the taxis were on strike.  Oddly enough\
  \ instead of panic I felt exhilaration.  My phone was dead; all I had was the address\
  \ of my youth hostel, a transit map, and a vague Google Maps image in my head. It\
  \ took one wrong bus, one train going the wrong way, a miscommunication that ended\
  \ in a smooch, and 3.5 hours to find the hostel.  But I did.  And I was proud of\
  \ myself.  \n\nI loved Barcelona; I gorged on tapas, sangria, and I danced on the\
  \ beach until the sun kissed the sea goodnight.  \n\n~Lisbon~\n\nMy following destination\
  \ was Lisbon.  I was feeling very confident upon arrival, my phone wasn\u2019t dead,\
  \ taxis weren\u2019t on strike and I had booked my hostel months in advance.  As\
  \ soon as I got to the hostel and the taxi driver left, I knew something was very\
  \ wrong.  The building was giving me the creepy crawlies.  I chalked it up to my\
  \ being nervous but as soon as I got upstairs I realized the photos they had posted\
  \ online were not the actual hostel.  My bad feeling continued to grow and I eventually\
  \ checked out within the hour.  As I was leaving I found out that one of the girls\
  \ had been eaten alive by bed bugs.\nThe hostel that I called home for the week\
  \ was incredible.  The communal breakfast, the organized group activities, everything\
  \ was top notch. \n\nBarcelona paled comparison to Lisbon.  The sound of my feet\
  \ on the ancient cobbled streets still resonates in my memory.  The waiter who showed\
  \ me how to properly eat my seafood forever in my heart.\n\nWhile in Lisbon I decided\
  \ to go to the Oceanarium to seek out the octopus.  The octopus is an animal that\
  \ I always related to, as they are intelligent, resourceful, and very emotional.\
  \  It was while seeing this creature\u2019s grasping tentacles that I realized I\
  \ had changed so much, and I had come so far.  I was no longer worried about how\
  \ the world saw me.  I was happy alone, and almost preferred my solitude.  I had\
  \ learnt how to handle stressful situations without getting overwhelmed.  I had\
  \ discovered that my gut instinct was a good navigator. And I realized I was happy.\
  \  Something I hadn\u2019t truly felt for many years. \n\nBefore I left Lisbon,\
  \ I went to the tattoo parlour; where I asked the artist to tattoo the octopus onto\
  \ my clavicle.  I had earned my tentacles, I will always be a wild creature that\
  \ is sometimes misunderstood, and I am not only okay but also elated with that."
