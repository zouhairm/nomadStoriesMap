Text: "To Dig for Gold and Dive For Pearls (in Mississippi Dust)\n\n\u201CTo understand\
  \ the world, you must first understand a place like Mississippi.\u201D \u2013 William\
  \ Faulkner\n\nMississippi in August must be the Eighth Circle. I fumed. Bare soles\
  \ baking on concrete, I braced myself against an undulating onslaught of touch and\
  \ sight. Brown-skin limbs reaching, chain link heaving, air sagging on my damp shoulders-\
  \ Jackson, Mississippi was folding in on itself. The parking lot of Morning Star\
  \ Baptist Church swayed under heat exhaustion\u2019s languor.\n Just over the dulled\
  \ hum of condolences and one very stubborn horsefly, I could hear a voice. \u201C\
  I\u2019m just another four-hour flight away. How easy it would be to leave.\u201D\
  \ The campaign office in Philadelphia where I photocopied pink fliers and refilled\
  \ coffee cups as a lowly intern beckoned to me, sweet promises of air conditioning\
  \ and no health benefits. Anywhere had to be better than here. \nFive hours off\
  \ the plane, and I had already painted my mother\u2019s hometown in muted colors.\
  \ Where Philadelphia was iron and steel, Jackson was brushed cotton and molasses.\
  \  Where Philadelphia pulsated, Jackson sighed. I\u2019d driven past abandoned strip\
  \ malls, stretching green highway morphing into railed and riddled side streets\
  \ to Downtown Jackson. There, in the center of drive-thru restaurants and billboards\
  \ of Big Promises, stood the Capitol building. It was the pope towering over his\
  \ congregation, all white regality and detached divinity amongst the common. I looked\
  \ away, some unnamed shame sitting heavy in my lap. \nI kept driving to Brown Bottom,\
  \ the embittered pet name for the section of town my mother grew up in, where the\
  \ only thing being advertised were malt liquor and cigarettes. Big Mama, my mother\u2019\
  s grandmother, was to be buried there where she lived her whole life. Her entire\
  \ life was encapsulated by two Mahalia Jackson songs at Morning Star, oak pews swathed\
  \ in purple velvet. \n\u201CPut your shoes on,\u201D my mother broke through. I\
  \ slipped my heels back on, pouting. She wiped my brow with the sleeve of her button\
  \ down and handed me a funeral fan, a paper program on a popsicle stick. \n\u201C\
  Take your sister to the shade, please. I have to stay here and mingle.\u201D\nHand\
  \ in hand, we walked through the throng. Shade was a pitiful patch near a small,\
  \ sun-bleached home on the corner of Northside Dr. I leaned against a magnolia tree\
  \ in the yard, my little sister in her linen dress at my feet, enveloped in the\
  \ heady fragrance. Counting cars that kicked up red dust and listening as a lawn\
  \ mower droned somewhere in the distance.\n\u201CY\u2019all are Chapman girls?\u201D\
  \ On the house\u2019s screened porch was a woman, long magenta nails and crepe paper\
  \ skin folding around a feline\u2019s grin. Ms. Rita and her whisper-song of a voice\
  \ called to us. She drew us in. \nMs. Rita\u2019s dulcet voice was leaden. \u201C\
  Ya Big Mama was a pearl diver.\u201D I faltered. Big Mama had been a teacher.\n\
  Sensing my skepticism, she continued, \u201CShe dove for treasure. She looked past\
  \ the surface.\u201D\nAnd with Ms. Rita, we dove. The streetlamps cast her faces\
  \ in orange as she told stories of my little Big Mama, a girl with purpled knees\
  \ climbing trees, trees that held children\u2019s laughter from the branches and\
  \ dark secrets. Ms. Rita was Nina Simone casting Mississippi in blues and reds.\
  \ We were drawn onto the porch where my mother soon joined. Heads resting on shoulders,\
  \ legs entangled, we dove in creeks, collected pill bugs, and played \u201CRed Light,\
  \ Green Light.\u201D We did it all through Ms. Rita\u2019s tales of her and Big\
  \ Mama growing up in this place, this pressure-cooker of dreams.\n\u201CI\u2019\
  m hungry,\u201D my little finally whined.\nEven the cicadas paused to listen. Ms.\
  \ Rita called somewhere deep inside the home. Ms. Rita\u2019s husband emerged with\
  \ a jar. He held the jar out to me. Written across the lid, emblazoned in Sharpie,\
  \ was GOLDIE\u2019S GOLD TUPELO SALTED HONEY. My finger, encased in amber, met my\
  \ tongue. \n\u201CAnd that\u2019s Mississippi, girl. The sickly sweet. The salt\
  \ to match,\u201D Ms. Rita\u2019s laugh rang out into the dusk.\nThe air was cool,\
  \ and I was closer to home than I'd ever been."
