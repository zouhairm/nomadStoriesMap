Text: "I had always wanted to live overseas, but often found excuses not to. Whether\
  \ it was too expensive or I had too many social obligations back home, there was\
  \ always something preventing me from following that dream. One day, after talking\
  \ to a friend who had moved to Germany, I found the courage to follow through and\
  \ began looking for jobs in South Korea. While it was initially terrifying, it ended\
  \ up influencing me in many ways. It showed me the joys of travel, exposed me to\
  \ new cultures, and made me more confident.\n    Before South Korea, I had never\
  \ lived outside of Minnesota and had never been outside of the country. Travel was\
  \ always something I craved but hadn\u2019t been able to entirely experience due\
  \ to budgetary and life reasons. Once I decided to take the leap and move to South\
  \ Korea, I knew it would open me up to all kinds of travel experiences. While living\
  \ there, I was able to see many different parts of the country, as well as take\
  \ trips to other parts of Asia like China, Cambodia, and Japan. After finishing\
  \ a year in South Korea, I decided to go to Japan, where I\u2019ve been living for\
  \ the past eighteen months. Now, as my life in Japan draws to a close, I\u2019m\
  \ ready to begin another chapter in my life traveling around Europe. It all started\
  \ with the decision, and now I have a hard time seeing a life where I\u2019m not\
  \ often going to new places.    \n    One of my biggest concerns before going to\
  \ South Korea was how I\u2019d be able to handle living in a culture vastly different\
  \ from my own. I was studying the language before I left, but I knew that I wouldn\u2019\
  t be able to communicate with many people. I also knew that food and lifestyle would\
  \ be different from my own. One of the things I remember most was shortly after\
  \ arriving; I was taken out to dinner with South Korean colleagues. I enjoyed a\
  \ lot of the Korean food that I had eaten up to this point, but a lot of it was\
  \ stuff that I think most foreigners would be comfortable like soup or barbecue.\
  \ This night, however, we were eating something called sannakji, which is raw octopus\
  \ tentacles that are still moving around on the plate. I had eaten and enjoyed raw\
  \ meat before, but none of them were wiggling while I ate them. I thought it might\
  \ be rude to turn it down and I wanted to be open to new things, so I worked my\
  \ chopsticks to try and pick up one of the smaller pieces. It was difficult to get\
  \ the tentacle off the plate because their suction cups are still active, but my\
  \ colleague was kind enough to help me out. All in all, it wasn\u2019t as bad as\
  \ it looked and it ended up being a great night of food, drinks, and laughter with\
  \ my new friends. As the year went on, I\u2019d continue to put myself out there\
  \ for new cultural experiences, and I had one of the best years of my life.\n  \
  \   It was challenging to uproot my life and go across the world leaving family\
  \ and friends behind, but I quickly made new friends, and over time it began to\
  \ feel like home. Now, when I think about going to a new place, I don\u2019t feel\
  \ any of that anxiety or hesitation. I know that I am capable of living pretty much\
  \ anywhere and adapting to the situation. I also feel more confident in meeting\
  \ new people. Not having any social support forced me out of my comfort zone and\
  \ made me meet new people. Since living in South Korea, I have met all kinds of\
  \ new people from all over the world, and I hope to continue doing that in my future\
  \ travels.\n  \tMoving my entire life to a new country was stressful at first, but\
  \ it led to opportunities for further world travel, learning about new cultures,\
  \ and becoming more self-confident. It wasn\u2019t always easy, but in the end,\
  \ it wound up being one of the best choices I\u2019ve ever made."
