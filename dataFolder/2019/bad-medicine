Text: "\"Wake up, guys! We've gotta go see the chief. He thinks we tried to kill his\
  \ baby!\"\n\nI awoke to commotion in the abandoned schoolhouse where our medical\
  \ team slept. Our typically unflappable leader, Penny, was shouting as she yanked\
  \ us from our tents: \"Grab your headlamps! We've gotta go NOW!\" A feeling of dread\
  \ washed over me when I realized this outing was mandatory. After a sweltering day\
  \ in clinic, complete with hourly latrine runs thanks to some unwashed fruit, I\
  \ was beyond tired. Hiking through the jungle in total darkness towards an enraged\
  \ village chief seemed wholly unappealing and physically impossible. It didn't feel\
  \ like the safest venture either; our camp lay on the banks of the Amazon River\
  \ Basin in a remote Peruvian community, and the closest village was hours away by\
  \ boat. No one would be able to save us if things turned violent.\n\nI had treated\
  \ nearly 100 patients that day in our primary care clinic, which was housed in a\
  \ building with dirt floors and bats in the ceiling. Our medical supplies and equipment\
  \ were primitive at best; we had brought everything from home, and it all had to\
  \ fit in the tiny wooden boat that would transport us from the city of Iquitos to\
  \ several villages along the Amazon River. \n\nMost of our patients had seen a physician\
  \ only once or twice in their lives. We treated primarily women and children presenting\
  \ with ailments ranging from rashes to malaria to stomach pains to grossly infected\
  \ foot ulcers. I was struck by their stoicism and patience as they calmly waited\
  \ for hours to be seen by \"Los Doctores Americanos,\" undaunted by the ghastly\
  \ heat and abundance of stray dogs roaming the clinic. The women barely flinched\
  \ as they underwent pelvic exams on narrow wooden benches swarmed by mosquitoes.\
  \ The children's eyes spelled a mixture of fear, curiosity, and awe as they tentatively\
  \ approached me, giggling nervously as I applied my stethoscope to their chests.\
  \ \n\nAs a medical student, I was thrilled when Penny trusted me to see the village\
  \ chief, his wife, and their newborn daughter in clinic. Limp in her mother's arms,\
  \ with a cough, high fever, and profound shortness of breath, the baby was critically\
  \ ill with bacterial pneumonia. After administering antibiotics, I fashioned an\
  \ inhaler out of an empty soda bottle, hoping it would decrease the inflammation\
  \ in her lungs and help her breathe more easily. The baby quickly improved, and\
  \ I beamed with pleasure at my diagnostic skills.\n\nNow, we were trudging through\
  \ the muddy jungle at 2:00 AM to the chief's hut. A local had informed Penny that\
  \ the baby's condition had worsened, and the chief believed that my medicine had\
  \ poisoned her. I vacillated between panic and fury. Why had I thought that a grueling\
  \ medical trip would be a good initiation into South American culture? Why hadn't\
  \ I just gone to Lima or Cusco or hiked the Inca Trail to Machu Picchu like everyone\
  \ else? I hadn't prepared myself for the possibility that our patients would doubt\
  \ our good intentions, no less think we meant them harm.\n\nWhen we arrived at the\
  \ chief's house, the entire village was there waiting for us. The locals' narrowed\
  \ eyes conveyed suspicion, anger, and disgust; they seemed to say, \"who are these\
  \ white foreigners who come to 'help' and just mess things up?\" I immediately felt\
  \ ashamed at my earlier arrogance. Thanks to a dedicated Spanish interpreter, tensions\
  \ eased over the course of the night, and the chief agreed to return with us to\
  \ Iquitos, where his daughter received life-saving treatment.  \n\nWhen I reflect\
  \ on my time in the Amazon jungle, I remember the glorious sunsets that enveloped\
  \ our boat. The meals of chicken and rice encased in banana leaves. The heat. The\
  \ bugs. The smell of cooking fires. The way it felt to treat my first real patients.\
  \ But most of all, I remember the courageous people of that Peruvian village who\
  \ put their trust in my care and allowed me to treat them, knowing only that I was\
  \ a \"woman doctor from the USA.\""
