Text: "Day 40 of our 20,000km trip around Western Australia.  Next on our agenda:\
  \ a day tour to the Horizontal Falls, departing Broome 5.15am. We mill roadside\
  \ near our caravan park entrance in the pre-dawn gloom, our designated pick-up point.\
  \ Nearby loiter three other couples awaiting their collection by the mail truck.\
  \ Yes, tourists can subsidize the seldom-used but essential postal run from Broome\
  \ to Cape Leveque with the mail in their lap; a great little money earner for the\
  \ mailman. \n\nAs they clamber in among the parcels, we are whisked to the airport\
  \ in a mini-coach to board a sea plane, then flown to a large pontoon in the Buccaneer\
  \ Archipelago for a continental breakfast. Sharks circling the pontoon are hand-fed\
  \ theirs while we eat ours. Next comes the briefing and donning of safety gear before\
  \ straddling our mounts and holding on tight aboard a speedboat for daredevil runs\
  \ through the Horizontal Waterfalls, previously known by the old pearl divers as\
  \ Hell\u2019s Gate. These bays lie in hourglass formation, the tides rising and\
  \ falling much faster than their narrow openings allow, the water building up at\
  \ each gap before cascading down into its bay, creating the falls. During a king\
  \ tide the water level can vary by as much as 5 metres. Skilled skippers will only\
  \ pass through the gaps with a water height differential of up to 1.5 metres; any\
  \ attempt beyond this being truly life-risking. The first churning chasm is 20 metres\
  \ wide, the second less than 10 metres. We do each white-knuckled pass several times.\n\
  \nThen it was back to the pontoon for a post-adrenaline hot breakfast.  My husband\
  \ and I elect to take the optional extra, a scenic helicopter flight over the falls.\
  \ Dave sits in the front of the chopper \u2013 no doors \u2013 and we are James\
  \ Bond cool zooming low over tropical islands and glistening bays when a totally\
  \ uncool thing happens. Dave\u2019s magnetic clip-on sunglasses lenses suddenly\
  \ detach from his prescription glasses and plummet toward the ocean below.\n\nA\
  \ brief interlude on the incredible history of Dave\u2019s sunglasses lenses is\
  \ needed at this point. They have fallen out of a bus window (narrowly missed being\
  \ run over); been lost on a beach (we drove back some 10km to search for them in\
  \ the sand and actually found them); and fallen off the back of a yacht (someone\
  \ dove into the water and retrieved them as they sank).\n\nBut now, as the lenses\
  \ spiral downward, their luck seems finally through. 007 Dave swings out of the\
  \ chopper, gripping the skid to break his fall with one hand, while reaching down\
  \ to snatch his lenses from thin air with the other hand\u2026 just kidding\u2026\
  \ rewind\u2026 Dave watches helplessly as his lenses tumble towards the shark and\
  \ crocodile infested waters far beneath. But as the chopper lands on the top deck\
  \ of the pontoon, Dave bounds out and then down two flights of stairs to coolly\
  \ stoop down and sweep up his lenses \u2013 still in one piece \u2013 that have\
  \ somehow landed on the pontoon walkway scarcely 2 metres wide and surrounded by\
  \ sea. \n\nDave grins. \u201CI didn\u2019t expect to find those again!\u201D His\
  \ lenses live to die another day.\n\nShortly thereafter our seaplane glides back\
  \ in to pick us up, and the pilot alights. Of course, if this was a Bond movie,\
  \ the pilot would be a gorgeous female with sweeping blonde hair and impossibly\
  \ long tanned legs, bare feet and tiny shorts. Wait, this is our seaplane pilot.\
  \ Not kidding. And this being Dave\u2019s James Bond day, she beckons him to come\
  \ and be her co-pilot. Still not kidding. To the amazement and slight concern of\
  \ the rest of us passengers, Dave straps himself into the co-pilot\u2019s seat and\
  \ eyes off the cockpit full of switches and gauges like a bee in a florist shop.\
  \ \n\n\u201CDo you have a pilot\u2019s licence?\u201D asks one passenger nervously.\
  \ Hey, it never seems to be a problem for James Bond, just roll with it, dude. \n\
  \n\u201CDon\u2019t worry, I won\u2019t press the big red button\u201D says Dave.\n\
  \nPS - He went home with this brunette, not the blonde pilot. He also lives to die\
  \ another day."
