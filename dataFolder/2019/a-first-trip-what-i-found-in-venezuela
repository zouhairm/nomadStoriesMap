Text: 'I was eighteen when I left Brazil for the first time. I''ve always wanted to
  do something outside. No one explains how I learned Spanish by myself when I was
  ten. Nobody explains how I lived out for four years and how I went to college and
  survived if my initial plan was just make a four-month backpack - with my fortune
  of five hundred american dollars. Perhaps, cause the devaluation of the Venezuelan
  currency would lead to unmanageable inflation. Perhaps, cause the climate of dictatorship,
  demonstrations followed by deaths, lack of inputs, and disappearances of opponents,
  was something common just after the four days I have arrived. Perhaps, cause it
  was my destiny. Despite my fear and certainty that everything would go wrong, I
  decided to stay. How likely is it to take advantage of this situation? How can we
  make the world and people aware and make them understand that reality doesn''t reach
  us? Living in the city of Merida allowed me to leave the bubble. People from there
  are amazing and they need help.


  I want to find more places, and get the information to come, I want everyone to
  see that the Venezuelan sea is the most beautiful in the world, I want to find my
  roots in each place, and understand why I''m there.'
