Text: "\u201CDrink the juice, then we\u2019ll talk.\u201D I couldn\u2019t believe\
  \ what I was hearing. A cheerful young man came out of the back room to pour my\
  \ sister and I drinks. Here we were in Pamukkale, Turkey, the sun had gone down,\
  \ and we couldn\u2019t find our guesthouse. Taking the safe route, we walked down\
  \ a lit street and were coaxed inside a small tourist shop. The sparsely decorated\
  \ room was filled with about six men ages twenty to thirty and it was just Sierra\
  \ and me sitting in front of one of their desks. We had just walked down from the\
  \ travertines after experiencing its incomparable sunset. \n\tSierra picked up the\
  \ glass of mango juice and started drinking it quickly. Rule number one is don\u2019\
  t accept drinks from strangers and yet here she was. I punched her multiple times\
  \ in the side of her thigh and she glanced back at me with a look that said, \u201C\
  What is your problem?\u201D I took a small sip of mine to look polite and then asked\
  \ if they could help us find our way \u201Chome.\u201D They had been joking about\
  \ how much we were smiling and suggested that we liked them. It didn\u2019t make\
  \ sense to them why we were smiling despite being lost and the best answer we had\
  \ was \u201CWe\u2019re Canadian, we always smile.\u201D Despite the joking atmosphere,\
  \ I had a bad feeling about the situation but figured it was better than getting\
  \ lost in the dark. \n\t\u201CYes, I can take you to the guesthouse but one at a\
  \ time,\u201D the man behind the desk casually replied. I was not going to be separated\
  \ from my sister, so I immediately said, \u201CNo, we need to go together.\u201D\
  \ They mulled over what to do and agreed on using the scooter. Upon sensing our\
  \ hesitancy, they called out to the back of the shop and a timid young woman appeared.\
  \ We all proceeded out the front door back into the hot dark evening. The man and\
  \ woman went to the side of the building. It was quiet out on the street and I was\
  \ thankful that it wasn\u2019t raining like it had the night prior. A few seconds\
  \ later he pulled up on an old motorcycle and she came over with a bright blue scooter\
  \ looking very unsure about how to operate it. \u201COne of you will ride with me,\
  \ and the other will ride with her,\u201D he said, motioning for us to come over.\
  \ I immediately volunteered myself for the motorcycle since I felt more comfortable\
  \ with Sierra riding on the scooter with the woman. \n\tI was terrified as the engine\
  \ roared and we took off. \u201CHey, could you not go too fast?\u201D He obliged\
  \ and slowed down a little. The cool breeze was a nice shift from the relentless\
  \ daytime sun and thirty-degree weather. I quickly glanced back to make sure Sierra\
  \ was still there. They knew the area where the guesthouse was located but didn\u2019\
  t know the exact address. Luckily I remembered the street and was able to help.\
  \ I took a moment to appreciate that we were speeding through a small town in a\
  \ foreign country relying on the kindness of strangers. It seemed surreal.\nAs we\
  \ pulled up in front of our inconspicuous guesthouse, a giant sense of relief washed\
  \ over me. We graciously thanked the man and woman for getting us there and started\
  \ walking towards the entrance. Before they rode away we turned around and waved\
  \ goodbye. Sierra turned to me and asked, \u201CWhy were you punching me in the\
  \ leg earlier? I saw the man crack the seal of the juice!\u201D Somehow I hadn\u2019\
  t noticed and we started to laugh. \n\tWe were moved by their kindness, they really\
  \ didn\u2019t need to drive us. I found that it was a struggle to find a balance\
  \ between staying safe and making actual connections with local people. As young\
  \ women especially we need to keep our guard up but also be able to accept kindness\
  \ when it\u2019s sincere. Despite being in a vulnerable situation, these people\
  \ had shown the true hospitality that the Turkish people are known for."
