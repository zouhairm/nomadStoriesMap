Text: "There was a spatter of blood and a splash of entrails on the red suede of the\
  \ high-heeled boots the well-heeled woman next to me was wearing. It was on her\
  \ left boot, which had evidently ventured a little too close to the once-white sheet\
  \ we and a crowd of observers were hovering around. I stared at her bloodied shoe,\
  \ momentarily distracted from the spectacle taking place before us. We were in a\
  \ cavernous warehouse at one end of Hobart, the capital city of the Australian state\
  \ of Tasmania. Her shoe seemed suddenly incongruous, some strange intrusion of the\
  \ raw and the bloody into the civilised world.\n\nIn front of us, the last ten minutes\
  \ of a gruelling three hour performance orchestrated by the Austrian avant-garde\
  \ artist Hermann Nitsch was unfolding. In the final sequence, a crowd of performers,\
  \ once-dressed in white, were crowded around the butchered carcass of an enormous\
  \ bull. The empty space between the bull\u2019s ribs having been stuffed with blood,\
  \ milk, animal innards and bloodied fruits and vegetables. When cued by a piercing\
  \ whistle, the performers threw themselves onto the carcass, wrenching wet handfuls\
  \ of its contents to press against their clothes, their skin, their hair, dyeing\
  \ themselves red. The discordant blare of a brass band playing at one end of the\
  \ performance space accompanied the bacchanal writhing, failing to hide the tell-tale\
  \ squelch of bodily fluids and flesh colliding, again and again. A sour metallic\
  \ smell hung in the air.  \n\nBludgeoned by sound, my mouth dry, I watched as a\
  \ rotund man in a black fedora \u2013 the artist Nitsch himself \u2013 thrust his\
  \ arms up into the air at each barely discernible crescendo of the now thundering\
  \ music. Ecstasy, or something like it. Blood and guts flew. It was darkly comical,\
  \ or it wasn\u2019t, I couldn\u2019t decide. I wasn\u2019t able to think much of\
  \ anything, but in some visceral way, I understood something new. \n\nThe performance\
  \ was being staged as one of the centrepieces of Tasmania\u2019s winter solstice\
  \ festival, Dark Mofo. Utilising the carcass of a bull destined for slaughter, it\
  \ had attracted the ire of animal rights activists for weeks beforehand. Broadly\
  \ sympathetic to their goals, I had filed past the po-faced protestors into the\
  \ venue with some sense of trepidation, doubting my own judgment. \n\nI had half-expected\
  \ provocation for the sake of provocation, a battering of the senses which would\
  \ leave me only empty and drained. Instead, inside, I found something else. The\
  \ imposing physicality of this slaughtered bull and the enormous reserves of its\
  \ blood, previously extracted, was a blunt reminder of the toll we exacted every\
  \ day through our own consumption. \n\nAs the ritualistic performance progressed,\
  \ growing increasingly surreal, disgust and awe warred. Underneath it, there was\
  \ a growing understanding: that life and death have existed, always, in the closest\
  \ proximity to each other, and that our lives, no matter how refined and urbane\
  \ in appearance, are built in an inescapable way on slaughter and exploitation and\
  \ sacrifice. \n\nIt was appropriate, too, that I had come to Tasmania to witness\
  \ this. Australia\u2019s island state, the site of a near-extermination of Indigenous\
  \ people in the early parts of Australia\u2019s colonial history, is a forgotten\
  \ mourning ground and a graveyard, one of the starkest illustrations of a continuing\
  \ history of dispossession and violence with which we have failed to reckon. Here,\
  \ as at home, spilt blood was always sitting close to the surface. \n\nThe dissonant\
  \ strains of the music cut to a sudden, yawning silence as the marathon performance\
  \ drew to a close. All of a sudden it had ended, the spell over, and I was stumbling\
  \ out into the weak winter sunshine with the crowd. \n\nThe woman in the red suede\
  \ heels passed me in the crush. I noticed the entrails clinging to her boots had\
  \ fallen loose. The bloodstain, still visible, would be tougher to get out."
