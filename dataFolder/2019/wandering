Text: "I didn\u2019t expect to find a piece of myself in every city that I wandered\
  \ through.\nI\u2019ve never picked up a map, or so much as Googled the most popular\
  \ spots to eat. When I jump on a plane, my headphones serve as compass and my notebook\
  \ tends to lead. \nI\u2019ve learnt a great deal about myself this way. I know I\
  \ naturally veer left, though I\u2019m right handed. I think it\u2019s my innate\
  \ rebellion and desire to fight the status quo. I know I\u2019m only fussy in establishments\
  \ that have 4+ stars or look like what I\u2019m used to. But give me a street vendor\
  \ and a milk crate, and you\u2019ll not once hear me complain. I know that despite\
  \ growing up in the cold of Toronto, Canada; I\u2019d sooner perish in heat that\
  \ envelopes your body with sweat than drudge out with a snowboard or skis. There\u2019\
  s a type of silence when you are alone in your room, phone down, laptop tucked away.\
  \ Then there\u2019s the type of silence of being in a foreign country, where there\
  \ are thousands of people all around you, but they don\u2019t understand you, nor\
  \ you - them. They stare because you dress differently, hold yourself differently,\
  \ don\u2019t look like somebody who might frequent there enough to become a local.\
  \ Your phone is in hand, but it\u2019s stupid o\u2019clock back home, and nobody\
  \ but the receptionist at the hotel has much time for you. You\u2019re lost, and\
  \ not just because your headphones are a terrible, terrible choice of compass. \n\
  \nIn every city I\u2019ve ever travelled to, though it\u2019s always been in the\
  \ moments I expected it the least, I found crucial pieces to the jigsaw puzzle that\
  \ make up who I am.\nIn Kenya, I realised I am worthy of kindness; and though the\
  \ world would always be a place where bad people do bad things, I am never too far\
  \ from somebody who will greet me, then seat me, then lend me an ear. In the Congo,\
  \ I learnt that I am strongest for those around me who I love deeply. In any moment\
  \ where I feel alone, and like I can\u2019t continue on my path, I remember moments\
  \ that I overcame my biggest fears with but a hair of a second to make the decision\
  \ to do so. In London I came to understand that the way in which I express love\
  \ is not necessarily how I will receive it, and neither expression is \u2018right\u2019\
  \ or \u2018wrong\u2019. In Spain I learnt that my perspective is not gospel, and\
  \ just because my eyes saw blue does not mean yours saw it too. \nIn Johannesburg\
  \ I learnt that I am stubborn. Not horoscope, \u2018stars tell all\u2019 stubborn.\
  \ But the kind of stubborn that guarantees success, and many, many, many maiming\
  \ hardships. In Toronto, I learnt that I am most lonely at home. And in Melbourne,\
  \ my now \u2018home\u2019, I learnt that I have no home. That my headphones, and\
  \ notebook are as close as I will ever come. And my insatiable thirst to answer\
  \ the question \u2018why\u2019 is also the answer here. \n\nI didn\u2019t expect\
  \ to find a piece of myself in every city that I wandered through. But I did, and\
  \ I just can\u2019t stop wandering."
