Text: "Kolkata the City of Joy as it is called, is also commonly considered as the\
  \ 'Paris of the East' as there's a happy amalgamation of different cultures, styles\
  \ and moods, coupled along with numerous forms of industries and commerce and politics.\_\
  The City intrigues those who look beneath her seemingly impregnable layers of reputation\
  \ imposed on her over the years. She offers a zillion frames by the minute for the\
  \ perceptive eye and the open heart.\n\nWhen you walk the City, she offers herself\
  \ to you \u2013 and all you have to do is either absorb and move on, or freeze whatever\
  \ you can for posterity. Either ways \u2013 you make memories and you find that\
  \ a part of your soul finds anchorage here.\n\nRelish the rain kissed morning- with\
  \ the white marble monument of the Victoria memorial  or Marble Palace looming large\
  \ in the background. Savour the petrichor of this City- it\u2019s heavenly. Walk\
  \ barefoot on her grassy Maidan and catch the laid back city stretching herself\
  \ out here.\n\nTurn the corner in Sudder Street and suddenly the graffiti hits your\
  \ eye, and so do the City constants like the ubiquitous hand pulled rickshaw and\
  \ the enormous trams on road - the journey by tram via Red Road is amazing. Discover\
  \ the Rajbari at Shobhabazar, Baghbazar and the quaint shady bylanes of North Kolkata.\
  \ Add a colourful sari in the frame, and it\u2019s like salt to taste in a perfectly\
  \ cooked up dish served by the city.\_\n\nAmidst the hectic schedules of work and\
  \ even prayer, friends here find time to catch up with each other. Resound on to\
  \ the reverberating azaan at the Nakhoda Mosque, light up the incense stick at the\
  \ Kalighat temple, sing hymns at the St. Paul's Cathedral, meditate at Belur Math\
  \ or recite the Amrit Bani at Gurdwara Bara Sikh Sangat.\n\nA quiet moment spent\
  \ with the one who has gone. All that remains, are memories that glow softly like\
  \ the candles at the grave. Kolkata remembers\u2026 silently. fondly. deeply at\
  \ the South Park cemetery, or Gobra Burial ground or the Keoratala Mahashamshan.\n\
  \nMan, Bridge, River, City- all standing strong. Centuries have flown like the water\
  \ under this Howrah Bridge, Vidyasagar Setu and so many more. \n\nThe gastronomic\
  \ voyage is indeed something that cannot be penned. From the famous Kathi rolls,\
  \ to street side masala cha, from varieties of fried fish to the unending list of\
  \ delectable sweets. There is Jalebis,\_Soota Kababs,\_Dahi Papdi Chaat,\_Gaathia,\_\
  Dalpuri, Chai,\_Chilla, \_Chowmein, Bhel Puri, Jhaal Muri,\_Puchkas, Paw Bhaji,\
  \ Shingara, Aloo Puri, Fish Fry, ,Fish Kabiraji, fowl cutlets, mishti doi, Rosogolla\
  \ - the range that you will experience will be a delight for all foodies.\n\nThe\
  \ city of Tagore and Ray speaks it all. \nThe museum at Jorasanko speaks highly\
  \ of the rich cultural heritage. The knowledge hub speaks multitude with the Boi\
  \ para at College Street, the heaps of books is a wonder sight. The coffee and cacophony\
  \ at Coffee House is indeed a place to laugh your hears out. \n\nThe City breathes\
  \ life through all her pores. She is Kolkata.\_\nCome to Kolkata and leave the rest\
  \ to her!"
