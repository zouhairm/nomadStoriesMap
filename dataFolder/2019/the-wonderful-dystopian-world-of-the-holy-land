Text: "The word my uncles says the most is \u201Ccontrol\u201D. He uses it for everything.\
  \ I have been a couple of days in Israel with him and I already know why. My uncle\
  \ has lived here over twenty years; he is a Franciscan friar. Jerusalem is not exactly\
  \ beautiful. It is rather intriguing, an ancient maze in which different cultures\
  \ have built their beliefs one above the other. It is fun to discover all the layers\
  \ of this particular palimpsest; the way everyone adapts it to pray in a different\
  \ way. We cross one of the borders to get to Bethlehem. I eagerly look for Banksy\u2019\
  s interventions on the wall that protects Jerusalem from the Palestinian states\
  \ that surround it. \n\tWith my uncle I am able to go in any hidden passage I can\
  \ find in the convents; I see the old places where they used to make their own wine;\
  \ I climb up and above the dome in certain churches. My uncle arrives to any catholic\
  \ place and everyone runs to say hi to him. He speaks in different languages, I\
  \ hear his Italian, Hebrew, Arab; and he never looses this kind of sweet and slow\
  \ cadence in his voice. \n\t\u201CControl\u201D is still the word I hear the most.\
  \ There is a constant tension in every frontier. It is a violent process in different\
  \ ways, either they drag you down or rush you up. Some of the agents are nice, some\
  \ are direct, others look down on me. It is, of course, a complicated place, which\
  \ I do not understand completely, and yet I feel safe. My uncle says I could walk\
  \ alone in the middle of the night without the fear of being killed, kinapped or\
  \ rapped, as I would be in my own country. Control would give me such privilege.\n\
  \tEven the dessert is modified to obey the State. I hear that somehow they manage\
  \ to maintain a layer of a certain type of sand above the ground near the border.\
  \ Human steps are easily spotted with this technique. It sounds unbelievable and\
  \ yet it makes a lot of sense. But of course \u201Ccontrol\u201D is not the only\
  \ thing I am astonished by. The dessert is the most beautiful sea you could ever\
  \ behold. I take it in every single day, knowing I will miss it. Part of it is still\
  \ green; the winter rains have managed to paint it that way. Then the rocks begin,\
  \ with waves carved at the sides of the road. It seems as though the wind \u2014\
  merciless as it is in this part of the world\u2014 writes a code in the stone. There\
  \ are other parts in which there is nothing but land, that spreads into its own\
  \ emptiness. \n\tThe road leads us below the sea level. The Dead sea is very much\
  \ alive today. It is weird to see it so dark. Before, from afar, it looked clear\
  \ blue, like the color lakes have on maps. Waves are some kind of menace; the water\
  \ burns the vulnerable parts of the body. There are special instructions to get\
  \ in. One cannot really swim in it. One floats. We go slow, we cannot splash water\
  \ around. I sit and the water rises me instantly. I stay there effortless watching\
  \ the shore from far away. Behind me the dessert mountains look purple and it is\
  \ as though I could touch the sun beams that lighten up the water here and there.\
  \ A little bit of water finds its way into my mouth, the taste is salty, bitter,\
  \ oily, and yet I am glad I feel fully immersed into the waves. \nI take a minute\
  \ to be absorbed by what I am seeing. I stand in awe in front of the attraction\
  \ of different faiths, ways of life, words; in front of this landscapes that tell\
  \ me that somehow we still worship nature. I feel as though I can never take it\
  \ in completely. How can I ever be sure that I\u2019m not being na\xEFve when I\
  \ write something regarding Israel? And yet I have words, and thoughts and emotions,\
  \ and I am glad I lived through all that with a guide such as my uncle."
