Text: "What I expected to find walking around Brussels was the seriousness and strictness\
  \ of a north- european big city. Fortunately the European Union capital is not only\
  \ about offices and institutional buildings. Yes, there is the European head quarter\
  \ area and is absolutely worth a visit but the soul of Brussels is not only that.\
  \ \nBrussels is multiethnic, free and rich of underground artistic and cultural\
  \ life.\nThe belgian capital hosts the highest varieties of ethnies in Europe. \n\
  There you can find every kind of food, shops, people from all over the world. Walking\
  \ around you will heard people talking French and Flamish, the two official belgian\
  \ languages, but also English, Italian, Spanis, Arab, Chinese, Indian and so on.\
  \ \nBelgium has been a sicure shelter for political refugees in history. Karl Marx,\
  \ Victor Hugo, people escaping from European and South American dictatorship found\
  \ hospitality in Brussels in the name of freedom. Belgians are proud of this culture\
  \ of freedom and individual rights. They espress it in every day life when they\
  \ sit down on the square floor, such as the amazing Grand Place or the Flamish Place\
  \ Saint- Catherine, hanging out with friends, or when they claim their right to\
  \ pee in public... I know this last point was quite shocking for me too! A very\
  \ friendly atmosphere for the city of European Parliament! But Brussels is exactly\
  \ this, a big 'who cares', always respecting other people of course. \nThe variety\
  \ of ethnicities and the spirit of freedom in Brussels help to develop a very interesting\
  \ artistic scene. The city center, from Brussels Central throught Avenue Anspach\
  \ untill La Bourse, is full of street artists, singers and breakers. If you take\
  \ a walk on one of the city parc you will certainly find an on going jam session.\
  \ Events like free concert, political debates, exhibitions, vintage or local market\
  \ are spread around the city.\nBrussels defintely surprised me. Is not beautiful\
  \ as Paris is, is not crazy as New York, not unique as Rome but is a lot of cities\
  \ inside a big one. Not even that big actually. But what I loved most of Brussels\
  \ is the claim of freedom you can breathe every where."
