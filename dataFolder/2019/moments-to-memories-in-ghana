Text: "I had traveled 7,558 miles from California to Ghana to spend a month on the\
  \ west coast of Africa. I was staying at a local orphanage, a familial comfort since\
  \ I spent most of my time with kids in California. The wifi was decidedly slow and\
  \ electricity was a gamble but in Kasoa Ghana, the local connection made to the\
  \ people was quicker and much stronger than any high-speed network could ever promise\
  \ to be.\n\nMy first day in Kasoa, I met a six-year-old girl with the smoothest\
  \ complexion blushed pink in youth. She had full lips enveloping bright white teeth\
  \ and was even more energetic than she was angelic. Before I could ask her name\
  \ she jumped up with open arms, swiftly maneuvering her legs until she was mounted\
  \ securely on my left hip. I carried her dutifully, secretly pleased that Gifty\
  \ had chosen me to be the pedestal on which she stayed displayed for the rest of\
  \ the evening. \n\nWhen I met a new face, I bent over and introduced myself as \u201C\
  Hannah,\u201D following up quickly with, \u201Clike Hannah banana\u201D. Hoping\
  \ some sort of Mnemonic trick would help the kids remember and recall my name easily.\
  \ \u201CMadame Kwadu, Madame Kwadu!\u201D, they chanted as laughs ballooned in their\
  \ bellies and escaped in fragments through their open mouths. Kwadu, I quickly learned,\
  \ was the Twi word for banana. It also happens to be my favorite in the language.\
  \ \n \nThe electricity at the orphanage went off multiple times a day was no inconvenience\
  \ for the kids because the sun was always consistent and powered the brightest light\
  \ outside. Besides, there were too many futbol matches to be had, tires to be rolled\
  \ and songs to be chanted to pay any mind to an unsteady electrical grid. Under\
  \ the dimming sky, we sat on the sun-baked earth with legs splayed sharing the meal\
  \ of the night. Mary eagerly waiting to see my reaction and audibly pleased when\
  \ I smiled and told her that I also liked her favorite food, fufu. I did. I liked\
  \ the fufu, I liked the jollof rice, and I liked the red red. I liked it all, and\
  \ I liked it best eating it next to my friends.\n\nThey showed me their favorite\
  \ games, I showed them mine. Most importantly, though, they showed me the proper\
  \ Ghanaian greeting to use as I traveled around the country. It was a simple handshake\
  \ that evolved into a thumb clasp with a smooth slide and a final snap. I tried\
  \ it on everyone, persisting until I got it right.  At Kasoa market I shook hands\
  \ with a local vendor and he shook his head and laughed. We both laughed as we tried\
  \ multiple times to get the perfect snap but \u201Cmy American hands were too soft\"\
  , he said, a residual smile still on his face.\n\nBy the end of the month, I had\
  \ handwritten notes in large wobbly letters, friendship bracelets braided in all\
  \ colors and detailed drawings that filled a special space in my suitcase. I had\
  \ enough paper surely to wallpaper my room. Each markered page a personal profile\
  \ helping me connect moments to memory. \n\n\u201CMy name is Junior. My favorite\
  \ food is apple. My best friend is Madame Hannah banana.\u201D"
