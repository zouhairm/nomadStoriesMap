Text: "Impossible is nothing! Yes, I have now experienced it. How? \nI have to visit\
  \ Iran for a short course on spirituality. It was an unexpected trip to Iran,reason\
  \ being that I was having less than 50 dollars in my bank account. No expectations\
  \ of funds, no vision of how I would be able to book my tickets and get my visa\
  \ stamped. Being a person of faith, I never expect any favour from humans rather\
  \ I seek support from the almighty God, asking for what I need in the middle of\
  \ the night. As it is said in the Holy scriptures that 'ask him in the middle of\
  \ the night when there is no distractions'. Three days left and still I was having\
  \ absolute faith in him as he is the one who holds authority over what is beyond\
  \ our control. There is no doubt about the planning of the master planner. I got\
  \ a call from my cousin who is from New Delhi, India usually visiting Iran for business\
  \ purpose. He said that I am going to Iran and it would be awesome if I could join\
  \ him. He asked me to give him my passport so that he can get it stamped. We together\
  \ went to boom tickets and after three days left to Tehran together. The place was\
  \ magical from the moment I landed. The beauty, culture, architecture and the most\
  \ spiritual shrines were things which were ethereal. I attended the course in Tehran\
  \ and them went to Qom and Mashhad. Both the cities famous for shrines of a sister\
  \ and a brother.  The shrine of Hazrat Masooma Fatima at Qom is one of the most\
  \ spiritual shrine. She was a pious woman and was martyed at a very young age of\
  \ 25. It is said that no prayer on her shrine can be denied, and I can feel it now\
  \ as whatever I wished there is fulfilled by her grace. Another shrine at Mashhad\
  \ of Imam e Reza, the 8th shia Imam. I went to Mashhad alone and stayed in a four\
  \ star hotel all sponsored by my cousin Syed Hani. \nI shared this experience of\
  \ mine because this increased my faith in the God as when there was no hope but\
  \ still I have faith in him, he sent his help in a form of my cousin. What I experienced\
  \ in Iran is something which I cannot put in mere words. I experienced the divine\
  \ oneness in Iran. It was the most profound of all feelings, Iran is so close to\
  \ my heart that I can never forget it. It has been more than six months now and\
  \ still I live everyday reflecting on the spiritual trip to Iran. That robust is\
  \ the impression of Iran on my heart. One of the best thing I got from Iran is a\
  \ friend from Serbia who is studying in Germany. Also I feel blessed to be a part\
  \ of that course on spirituality. I met the family of the revolutionary leader Imam\
  \ Khomeini and asked her daughter in law about her experience with him. She replied\
  \ 'there are countless experiences but one of the most profound was that he used\
  \ to visit an old man and gave him food every evening and when his son died even\
  \ on that day he went to give him the food, she also said that she was lucky that\
  \ she was able to spend time with a true human as most of us are not spiritually\
  \ awaken to a level where Imam Khomeini was. Being the most powerful person of his\
  \ time his lifestyle was so simple that he consume a very little food, gave everything\
  \ in the way of God and had no worldly desires. Such was his character and belief\
  \ on God. He succeed in what he wanted because of his faith in God.  I learned how\
  \ essential is faith in life from this trip of mine to Iran."
