Text: "Traveling in Palawan earlier this year, I noticed my friend\u2019s gaze lower\
  \ to the scar on my right shin. \n\nShe asked, \u201Cwhat happened?\u201D \n\nI\
  \ thought of the sunny, hot day in Jarabacoa, the Dominican Republic. January 3,\
  \ 2015. \n\nThe van was packed with all the medications, fold-up tables, medical\
  \ record binders, medical supplies and volunteers for the day. Doing a final check,\
  \ I headed back up to the apartment into the supply area to make sure we had gotten\
  \ everything. That day, our medical outreach team was traveling to the villages\
  \ in the mountains far from Jarabacoa to set up clinic.\n\nAfter locking up, I came\
  \ downstairs. Little did I know that after crossing the street I would not be joining\
  \ my team for the day. Blinded by a parked van, I did not see the two motorcycles\
  \ turning into that same cross walk at full speed. Hitting me with great force into\
  \ my right leg, I projectiled into the street, landing on my lower lumbar region,\
  \ and scraping my head.\n\nBleeding, bruised, and severely disoriented, I was rushed\
  \ in an ambulance to the main hospital in La Vega with my friend, Melissa. With\
  \ severe pain after the head injury, my body experienced shock, and as a result\
  \ was shivering and uncontrollably vomiting. The paramedics held me upright as Melissa\
  \ gave me her sweater to hold onto. \n\nUpon getting to the hospital, I saw Dr.\
  \ Encarnacion, the physician our medical team was working with. My attention quickly\
  \ shifted as I heard nurses screaming \u201CChica Americana, Chica Americana,\u201D\
  \ as they rushed toward me. I saw and felt needles pointing at me from a myriad\
  \ of directions. All vitals and medical instructions were said in a tongue foreign\
  \ to me. Terrified, an extreme and utmost sense of vulnerability came over me. \n\
  \nTrauma. Shock. Needles. Sensory overload. \n\nMinutes later I was slowly sedated\
  \ waiting for my X-rays and went into another room for examination. \n\nI woke up\
  \ 48 hours later in the hospital room ready for my final check up to be released.\
  \ This was the first time I personally experienced trauma. Trauma, for me, meant\
  \ being on the back end of medicine. It meant truly being able to experience being\
  \ a patient. and understanding the lasting impact of the power of human connection.\
  \ \n\nAccidents happen. You never know when they will, how big or small they may\
  \ be and how much of an impact they may have on you. The memory of that experiences\
  \ will forever be embodied within the scar I left with."
