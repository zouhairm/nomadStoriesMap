Text: "After living years in the life of a young native of Brooklyn, I was definitely\
  \ ready to go to Cusco, Peru.  There were continuous set backs leading up to my\
  \ actual trip.  No one in Peru knew when I was actually arriving.  My liaison at\
  \ the Maximo Nivel contacted me to inform that my driver at the airport could not\
  \ find me.  The airline had pushed my flight back to the point where I wasn\u2019\
  t arriving until Monday.  I was especially proud to go to Peru to cross the lines\
  \ of language and national boundaries as a person fo Guyanese descent.  Finally\
  \ in the city, the citizens of Peru made me very aware of how Incan culture had\
  \ outlasted years of Spanish transfiguration.  My first day in Cusco was comprised\
  \ of wandering around the streets.  My adventures led me to a tattoo parlor where\
  \ loud techno music dragged me inside.  I was greeted by the figure of a dwarf in\
  \ front of a crystal ball, creepy yet mystical.  \n\tOn my last day of volunteering\
  \ I decided to get a tattoo of a figure to commemorate my trip.  While wandering\
  \ through the city, I was constantly grasping for my breath and insignificant moments,\
  \ which appeared to be grand.  The waiter, at the first restaurant I went to, asked\
  \ me if I would mind eating with someone else.  After I agreed to, he sat an architect\
  \ down at the table with me.  To be from a country where people of color are not\
  \ the majority made this a fantastic moment of pure chance.  I continued to wander\
  \ throughout the streets after my meal and found the studio of a painter who made\
  \ Contemporary artwork in the Gothic revival style.  The language barrier between\
  \ the artist and myself made the situation unique.  However, it could not compare\
  \ to when I actually met my other housemates.  We were all gathered in an effort\
  \ to change the world, from individual paths, but it felt like we were meant to\
  \ be together.  \tMy task in Cusco was to help finish the expansion of a kindergarten.\
  \  The site manager of the construction site who guided us was epically masterful\
  \ at contraction techniques.  In order to celebrate becoming 30, I made the choice\
  \ to go on an ATV tour of the countryside one day.  We visited salt mines that were\
  \ 100 years old.  Families pooled their money together to buy plots.  The community\
  \ built a pre-communist system that preserved the Incan way of life for future generations.\
  \  This was awe-inspiring but could not compare to happy greeting of my host family\u2019\
  s huge German Shepard and Dalmatian puppy.  There was a moment when my roommate\
  \ and I made the foolhardy decision to hike up the hills to see a statue overlooking\
  \ the city.  We eventually found ourselves climbing up a triangular moment for the\
  \ best views of Cusco.  \n\tWhen I was coming back to Cusco from zip-lining in the\
  \ country, after a day of volunteering, I could never forget seeing a group of young\
  \ people drawing on steps and wanting to join them.  Altitude sickness got the best\
  \ of me, but I had already scheduled another trip to Macchu Picchu on my last day.\
  \  I refused to allow illness to get in my way and hiked up the mountain.  I kept\
  \ wandering around the site asking the guards if I could go further.  They repeatedly\
  \ said that the site was closed, but I could see a bit more if I headed over in\
  \ another direction.  If I had any idea that this was what my experience was going\
  \ to be life, I would have planned to stay for at least one more week, a month at\
  \ best."
