Text: "The engine vibrated gently, causing my head to buzz softly against the car\
  \ window, as I gazed contentedly at the array of autumnal colours surrounding me.\
  \ Long, straight roads stretched out ahead of us: a true testimony to the postcard,\
  \ North American adventure I'd longed for.\n\nTwenty-one years-old and experiencing\
  \ solo-travel for the first time, I\u2019d dreamt of this moment for months. En\
  \ route to Cape Breton, Novia Scotia with Chloe, my new Canadian friend, I was starting\
  \ to feel as though I was checking off the boxes on my Great Canadian Bucket List.\n\
  \nTwo months previous, my mother had dropped me off at Glasgow Airport, for a semester\
  \ abroad at a Canadian university. In tears, I waved goodbye and boarded a plane,\
  \ knowing for the next four months I\u2019d be on my own. \n\nUpon arrival, my worries\
  \ were soon forgotten, after befriending a gaggle of other lost souls that were\
  \ attending the university as international students. We immersed ourselves in the\
  \ college experience and whilst the North American clich\xE9s we\u2019d seen on\
  \ television kept us entertained, I couldn\u2019t help but feel home-sickness lurking\
  \ in the back of my mind: the novelty of keg parties and \u201Cfrat\u201D houses\
  \ wearing thin. \n\nI\u2019d been put in touch with a family from Cape Breton Island\
  \ and was thrilled when they invited me stay for the weekend. I\u2019d learned a\
  \ lot about Cape Breton: an island with a strong cultural link to the Scottish Highlands,\
  \ due to the Highland Clearances in the 18th century creating a diaspora of Scottish\
  \ Gaelic speakers all over the world, with a large concentration having settled\
  \ in Cape Breton. As a scholar of Scottish Gaelic, the prospect of conversing with\
  \ Gaelic speakers residing in another country, enthused me greatly.\n\nAfter a two-hour\
  \ drive with Chloe, we pulled up into the driveway of a beautiful, suburban, family\
  \ home \u2013 a Canadian flag swaying proudly in the air above us. The front door\
  \ swung open and an enormous, black Newfoundland came bounding out to greet us \u2013\
  \ globules of saliva dripping from its mouth with each thunderous footstep. \n\n\
  \u201CThat\u2019s Jag\u201D, explained a woman, grinning as she approached the car,\
  \ \u201C- after Mick Jagger\u201D. It was Emily, Chloe\u2019s mother. She invited\
  \ us in, where a huge spread of food awaited us. \n\n\u201CHere,\u201D said Emily,\
  \ \u201Ctry this whiskey. It\u2019s local!\u201D. I despise whiskey but gladly accepted,\
  \ warmed by the sincere desire to share their culture with me. It stung my throat\
  \ and we laughed. As I slowly sipped the remainder of my dram, attempting to disguise\
  \ the grimace that spread across my face with each mouthful, Emily excitedly told\
  \ me of the itinerary they had planned for my visit. I couldn\u2019t wait.\n\nOver\
  \ the course of the weekend, Emily and Chloe took great delight in introducing me\
  \ to their friends and family, showing me the local sights and if it weren\u2019\
  t for the difference in accents (and occasional road signs warning of moose and\
  \ bears in the area) I could have almost believed I was back home.\n\nOn the final\
  \ evening, I was asked if I\u2019d accompany the family to a square dance: a weekly\
  \ occurrence in parts of Cape Breton. I eagerly accepted. We arrived at a small,\
  \ village hall full of bodies hurtling around a crowded dance floor with the noise\
  \ of fiddle music, stamping and loud whooping filling my ears. I was 2500 miles\
  \ from Scotland, yet couldn\u2019t have felt more at ease. The homesickness that\
  \ had been niggling at me, dissipated and strangers were soon approaching me with\
  \ wide smiles, inviting me to dance. \n\nDuring one square dance (and after having\
  \ only just managed to avoid several hide-speed collisions on the dancefloor), Emily\
  \ grabbed my arm and whisked me off to meet someone. It was an elderly woman of\
  \ around 90 years. \n\n\u201CThis is Anna\u201D, grinned Emily. I politely introduced\
  \ myself but couldn\u2019t help notice Emily\u2019s eyes watching me, waiting in\
  \ anticipation for my reaction. The woman spoke to me.\n\n\u201CIs mise Anne. An\
  \ ann \xE0s an t-seann duthaich a tha thu?\u201D.\n(\u201CMy name\u2019s Anna. Are\
  \ you from the old country?\u201D).\n\n\u201C\u2019S ann!\u201D (\u201CYes!\u201D\
  ), I blurted incredulously.\n\n\u201CF\xE0ilte! Tha e cho math coinneachadh riut\u201D\
  .\n(\u201CWelcome! It\u2019s so good to meet you\u201D)."
