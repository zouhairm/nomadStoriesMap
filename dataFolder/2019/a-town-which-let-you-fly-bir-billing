Text: "The best feeling in life is \u2018you dream of something and that comes true\u201D\
  , I had always dream of paragliding but because of my fear of heights has never\
  \ let me do it. Finally, the fate brought me to this place which is world famous\
  \ as Asia\u2019s highest gliding point.\n\nWe were in the middle of planning for\
  \ a Pahadi trip again, the first place came in my mind was Bir. Kull was little\
  \ reluctant for not going to this place, after some agreements and dis-agreement\
  \ we booked Hemsuta, Volvo. Hotel was not booked as we wanted to explore a bit around\
  \ before deciding our place for next three days.\n\nWednesday, we boarded the Volvo\
  \ @1900 hrs from ISBT Kashmiri gate, they stopped at two places once for Dinner\
  \ and for a small tea break. Ideally, we were supposed to reach early morning at\
  \ 730 but the speed of the driver and the clear road made us jump at Bir @0630 am\
  \ only.\n\nNeat and clean with attached washroom we took the luxury camp looking\
  \ at the rain and chilled breeze around.\n\nHad breakfast at the camp site and headed\
  \ for Mud house, it was about a km away from the camps. Little uphill, we tracked\
  \ up and set they\u2019re for an hour or so. So, this was a Britisher\u2019s mastermind\
  \ that he started constructing the house for the visitors. During the Jungle where\
  \ no one was around at least for 5-6 km. A location for the pure nature lovers.\
  \ We came down after some chitter chatter, roamed around went more down towards\
  \ the Jungle and saw the camp area there were lot of green veggies.\n\nThe Bon-fire\
  \ session started at 630ish and went on till mid night with some booze.\n\n\u201C\
  The weather was calm, I could not hear anything but that silence of peace,\n\nthe\
  \ silence of that dense jungle,\n\nthe silence I have not heard from years, the\
  \ silence of love,\n\nthe Silence of bring happy and relaxed, the silence of my\
  \ own breath,\n\nthe silence we are missing in our day to day life the silence of\
  \ existence of life everywhere\n\nthe silence which only broke in the morning with\
  \ chirpings bird\u2019s sound.\n\n \n\nToday we checked in homestay,driver dropped\
  \ us at the landing point from where we started for Billing the take off point it\
  \ was about 50 mins away the landing point & the fear started in me somehow. I was\
  \ seating on the ground could not really gear up myself to run and jump\u2026 but\
  \ Kull gave me a boost though he himself was little scared. & then\n\n \n\nFrom\
  \ I wish to I have done it \u2013 My experience of Para gliding was thrilling and\
  \ amazing I still feel the breeze around. That 20 mins freedom of flying with the\
  \ birds cannot be converted in words. Just collect a bit of courage, close your\
  \ eyes & Jump from the cliff?\n\n \n\nJust outside the room we kept a small table\
  \ and two chairs and started the evening with slow sound songs and loud talks, we\
  \ were the first guest to enter in the home stay and around 1030.\n\n \n\nWe headed\
  \ for Monasteries the next day, I wonder how these monasteries have occupied such\
  \ vast beautiful spots of Himachal Pradesh.\n\n \n\nWe skipped the lunch and headed\
  \ toward Palampur for Bajinath Temple.The Lingam is said to be existing there since\
  \ time immemorial and now worshiped\u2019 Temple was the shrine to the mythological\
  \ \u2018Lingam.I felt quite tranquil when I came out of Baijnath Temple\n\n \n\n\
  We were lucky enough that the rain stopped, and we did paraglide in an amazing weather,\n\
  \nWe were lucky that Pre-practice of paragliding world cup was going on and we could\
  \ see the army\n\nWe were lucky to the Lama\u2019s practice for the upcoming world\
  \ cup event.\n\nWe were lucky that we stayed in the Homestay and could have the\
  \ local homemade food.\n\nWe were lucky that we had the complete camp area exclusively\
  \ for us and the whole attention of the staff was on us.\n\n \n\nGuys, Travelling\
  \ has become the food of my soul if I don\u2019t get it on time I starve, I get\
  \ irritated.\n\n \n\nFollow me @AJTRAVELBLOG"
