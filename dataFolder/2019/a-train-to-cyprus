Text: "We escape a few days. Me and him. We went away. \"To where? \" \" To an island,\
  \ to seeing the sea \". A poetical response for the idea of feeling the course of\
  \ time as a caress in the cheek, in the full belly, in the warm kisses between silences.\
  \ With the simple intention of losing our thoughts in the dark sand or in a bottle\
  \ in the ocean.\nWe feel the routine very real \u2026 biting our feet with hunger\
  \ and desperation, mocking of us, for our red eyes looking for dream. We were half-asleep,\
  \ half-awake, without flavors in the mouth, without colors in the sky. So... we\
  \ fly.\nAnd Cyprus received us sleepwalking, with a sunset sky between oranges and\
  \ grays and a cool wind that told us that the high season not yet started. The city\
  \ was a repeated summer city at the foot of the sea, with a dark sand and a promenade\
  \ of salty souvenirs. Hotels standing in line as guardians of the sea, devourers\
  \ of tourists, looking at the horizon with their melancholy windows. The restaurants\
  \ were mixed between lights and typical foods of the place and, as a wild card for\
  \ the conservatives: international fast food appeared as crushed stickers on the\
  \ sidewalks. It did not matter, none of that mattered, it was not what we were looking\
  \ for. \nWe were looking for the passing of time wasn't interesting, for see the\
  \ sun stretch calmly in the sky, for the windows the sea said hello to us and to\
  \ have the pleasure of spending time in bed. We were walking without rhythm, nowhere,\
  \ wanting to reach the end of the world and from there contemplate the center of\
  \ the earth.\nWe escaped again: first on a bicycle and then in an upside down car.\
  \ We reached the end of the island and there we started walking along a dirt road\
  \ between the mountains that were sunbathing, watching the seagulls fly.\nWe find\
  \ the end of the world! It was exactly where I wanted to be: the fresh water, the\
  \ blue sky, the hot sun and you there, smiling like a child, discovering the simplicity\
  \ of being there as well, contemplating, with me, in a place where nobody could\
  \ reach us. We dreamed of not returning and not staying, but we returned, neither\
  \ sad nor hurt. We just came back.\n\nI dream of traveling when I\xB4m travelling,\
  \ I have my suitcase ready, my camera loaded and a toothbrush in my handbag, you\
  \ just have to tell me when we leave.\nI dream of traveling when I\xB4m travelling,\
  \ sometimes on a plane to an island and sometimes on the train that takes us home."
