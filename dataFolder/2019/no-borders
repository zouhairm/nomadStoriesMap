Text: "No Borders\n\nI pick up my baggage and proceed to leave the airport terminal.\
  \ This is a much-awaited trip and I was at the EuroAirport Basel. Wait! What do\
  \ I see? One gate says towards France, the other says Germany and then another says\
  \ Switzerland. One airport three exits to three different countries. Neighbours\
  \ all, peacefully coexisting, thriving in each other\u2019s success stories. \n\
  Where I come from, there is no peace between neighbours! Soldiers stand eyeball\
  \ to eyeball manning the borders, day and night. Bloodshed and unexpected violence\
  \ order of the day. Stories fed to us since childhood are vicious ones, of mutual\
  \ distrust and discord. Fast forward today I see my beliefs disintegrate.\nAs I\
  \ step out taking the exit gate towards Switzerland, a fine tree-lined road greets\
  \ me, with buses lined up. I have to board a bus that takes me to the town centre\
  \ of Basel, before that I peek over my shoulder, are there buses on the French side\
  \ too. The airport is on French soil. As I shuffle forward looking for a particular\
  \ bus number, unable to comprehend either French or German, I am greeted by an elderly\
  \ man. He noticed my confusion! After a polite enquiry he points me towards a bus\
  \ which would take me to the central bus station in Basel, Bahnhof Basel SBB. \n\
  The bus is filled with travellers and after a while it slowly winds its way out\
  \ of the airport and towards the city. The conversations in the bus are in languages\
  \ I\u2019m not familiar with German, French and Italian. I sat quietly observing\
  \ the easy camaraderie of the people in the bus. The borders were just a few kilometres\
  \ away and here it was a global reunion. If only all the countries in the world\
  \ could live so harmoniously. My chain of thoughts was interrupted by a slight cough\
  \ and a query \u2018Speak English?\u2019, asked a woman right next to me. A small\
  \ introduction and a few sentences later, I learn that the woman is visiting a friend\
  \ here in France but decided to take a day off and explore Basel in Switzerland.\
  \ Her EU passport ensured she faced no glitches in her travel plans. That easy huh!\
  \ She even offered me a few suggestions to save me some money, like live and eat\
  \ in France and visit Switzerland for its beauty and bounty. It was that simple.\
  \ After a getting a few more of such travel tips my stop arrived and I disembarked\
  \ the bus. The bus station was a busy town centre bustling with people, trams, buses,\
  \ shops, pubs and restaurants. Till now my trip to this beautiful country has been\
  \ nothing short of revelations and good insights. Even though I spoke none of the\
  \ local languages, I had no problem negotiating my way. The roads were spotlessly\
  \ clean, and being summer it was that time of the year when every nook had a flower\
  \ pot filled with bright fresh flowers.  \nWhen at a time the world is filled with\
  \ mistrust and negative feelings, a trip from the airport with no borders, to the\
  \ centre of a Swiss town opened my eyes and heart to such possibilities, that could\
  \ not be garnered by reading self-help books. So, as I board my next bus to carry\
  \ me forward on my journey into this wonderful part of the world, I cannot wait\
  \ to savour what else it will throw up. A leap into the unknown."
