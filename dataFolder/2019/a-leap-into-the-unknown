Text: "London is the country I first visited abroad. It was in the summer of 2014.\
  \ My school sent me to a summer school in London called \"Bell school\" St.Albans.\
  \ And here is it is a timely this moment. I'm at London airport. I feel like I can't\
  \ put it into words. London is a huge anthill with almost 10 million people. Having\
  \ arrived there, I was absorbed in emotions! It was amazing: we took a ride on the\
  \ largest Ferris wheel, and then went to the Madame Tussauds Museum, which I have\
  \ long wanted to visit. There I had the opportunity to take pictures with wax figures\
  \ of celebrities and go to the room of fear ... It was horrible, my heart was in\
  \ my heels! It was really scary, but I got over it, and then I just laughed at the\
  \ idea of the room. The Museum is full of interesting things to see. A 5 \u2013\
  \ minute walk from my place of residence-a nice lake. The people of London are very\
  \ polite, always help and support foreigners. And it is interesting to note, they\
  \ always have a Cup of coffee or tea in their hands. I really loved this city and\
  \ once i will come back!"
