Text: "It\u2019s early morning in San Juan del Sur, and in this serene moment before\
  \ all of the shops and restaurants open I would swear I\u2019m in a sleepy paradise\
  \ that the realities of the world cannot touch; one where monkeys dangle in trees,\
  \ and you drink out of coconuts, and every person who passes you buy warmly greets\
  \ you with \u2018Buenos Dias\u2019. But I know that isn\u2019t true. Standing on\
  \ the beach of the crescent moon-shaped bay, I watch the shadows quickly glide past\
  \ the statue of Jesus perched over this little beach town on the southwest coast\
  \ of Nicaragua. It\u2019s known for its surf-ready beaches to the north and south,\
  \ and in 2016 it was on the verge of a tourism boom that never came. \n\nWalking\
  \ along the stretch of airy beachfront restaurants the previous evening, each one\
  \ punctuated with strings of warm glowing lights and waves crashing in the background,\
  \ employees try to lure us in with menus and offerings. A peek inside reveals empty\
  \ tables, and I realize that our decision to dine there might be the difference\
  \ between profit and loss. With that, I start to absorb the far reaching impact\
  \ of the political strife that hit Nicaragua in April of 2018. Commonly referred\
  \ to by locals as \u201Cthe situation\u201D, the economic fallout of these political\
  \ clashes and the violence that has ensued has kept tourists away, and the owners\
  \ and employees of hotels, guesthouses, and restaurants are left to wait and hope\
  \ that people will come back before they have to give up their livelihoods. \n\n\
  I am caught off guard by the extent of its reach, but perhaps I haven\u2019t been\
  \ paying attention.\n\nAfter all, the taxi driver on our first night did offer to\
  \ rent his van to us on the spot, and when we said no, he continued to lower the\
  \ price with the hope that we\u2019d change our minds. At the beach, the surfboard\
  \ rental shops looked fully stocked \u2013 not one board missing from its place.\
  \ Then there were the heavily discounted accommodations, advertised by hastily made\
  \ signs hanging out front.\n\nMy morning hasn\u2019t been quiet because it is early;\
  \ it is because no one is here.\n\nGranada, the picturesque colonial town just an\
  \ hour away, has fared no better. Near the town centre is a pedestrian road lined\
  \ with restaurants and patios under a canopy of lights, and it sits empty \u2013\
  \ most restaurants not bothering to open mid-week \u2013 a tactic to survive the\
  \ deafening silence of a ghost town in the wake of a conflict last June. Eventually,\
  \ we do find the one place that is open and we are the only table there. I find\
  \ myself overcompensating with enthusiasm for every part of the meal and a generous\
  \ tip that I hope is taken as a gesture of confidence and support, and not concern.\
  \ \n\nNicaragua is not alone; this is a pattern that we have seen in other economies\
  \ that heavily rely on tourism, such as Turkey and Jordan in recent years.  It is\
  \ here, though, that I recognize my privilege and the potential impact of the travel\
  \ decisions I make. Of course, all of this is secondary to the violence that has\
  \ erupted in the country, the lives that have been lost. But once the political\
  \ conflict is over, I wonder what will be left of this hard fought tourism industry\
  \ that has been more than 20 years in the making \u2013 28 years after the last\
  \ political war. It\u2019s a quiet hum, like a refrigerator, that\u2019s easy to\
  \ miss if you\u2019re far enough away; but now that I hear it, my view is forever\
  \ changed. I\u2019m aware now that each day where tourists don\u2019t come is one\
  \ day closer to closing up shop. It is death by a thousand paper cuts, and for anyone\
  \ not living it, the urgency is easy to ignore.\n\nWhen my trip reaches its end\
  \ and it\u2019s time to leave, I hope I will be saying \u2018see you later\u2019\
  , and not \u2018goodbye\u2019; not because I wonder if I\u2019ll make it back one\
  \ day, but because I hope that if I do, it will still be there to greet me with\
  \ \u2018Buenos Dias\u2019."
