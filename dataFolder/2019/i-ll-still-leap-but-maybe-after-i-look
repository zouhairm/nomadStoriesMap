Text: "My favorite travel companion has become my daughter, who is exactly 30 years\
  \ younger than I am.  I have traveled with my spouse, and with friends, and with\
  \ family, but perhaps my daughter rates at the top of the list because she has the\
  \ energy and fearsome nature that I lack.  There's something about youth and the\
  \ ability to venture into unknown territories that propels me into taking risks\
  \ that I would not otherwise. \n\nKelli had finished up a stint at working with\
  \ a teaching abroad program in Georgia.  I found this the perfect opportunity to\
  \ join her and travel a bit together before she returned to the states and began\
  \ seeking employment.   From the moment we decided to embark on this adventure,\
  \  it was fraught with uncertainty.  The group Kelli had been with had already disbanded.\
  \  We arranged to meet with only directions from Kelli (and no cell phones) in an\
  \ airport with which I was totally unfamiliar.  I had never actually flown that\
  \ distance alone.  Still, I was not dissuaded from a chance to see more of the world,\
  \ despite my nervous jitters.\n\nWe met up with little problem, and laughed together\
  \ at the sight of Kelli's immense suitcase (which had housed all of her needs for\
  \ her time away), loaded down even more by the gift her host family had given her:\
  \ a set of silverware.   Our first hotel, though modest, had a lovely view of the\
  \ Aegean Sea.  We were such novices to international travel that our tiny balcony\
  \ and the breakfast on the rooftop made us nearly giddy.   We had pushed heavy luggage\
  \ from the train to our hotel across bumpy bricks and I was ecstatic to see Kelli\
  \ again, after 3 months of her absence. \n\nWe savored our evening meal out, and\
  \ took a leisurely stroll in our hotel's vicinity.  It had not taken me long to\
  \ notice that willowy blonde-haired daughter was ogled by almost all the Turkish\
  \ men.  Yet, we were new to the country and were enjoying our chance to stretch\
  \ our legs.   Several open storefronts caught our eyes and we ventured into some\
  \ of them for a look at what might become possible gifts.   \n\nAfter glancing through\
  \ the outdoor clothing racks, we found ourselves in a well lit room full of scarves,\
  \ purses, clothing and jewelry.  The store owner, of course male, greeted us warmly,\
  \ with more than a little interest in the lovely young woman I was with.  There\
  \ was at least one other customer present also looking about the store.  Kelli and\
  \ I split up and I did not pay much attention to what she was shopping for.  She\
  \ called me over for a look at some scarves she had found attractive, and I found\
  \ myself looking through them too;  scarves with patterns, scarves with lace, scarves\
  \ of various fabrics and sizes.   Both of us by this time were curious about their\
  \ prices.   We felt no pressure to buy as we had the next few days to stroll the\
  \ streets with opportunity to find something we wanted even more than scarves. \
  \ \n\nThe shopkeeper joined us with effusive gesturing and enthusiasm.   His other\
  \ customer had left the store and now we were the two left to focus on.   When he\
  \ understood our question, he gave us a number that meant little to us, but served\
  \ as a reminder that we could wait on our decision until the next day.    Almost\
  \ immediately  it felt apparent that he did not want to give up on a possible sale.\
  \    We stood and awkwardly thought about our scarves, but he had gone to the front\
  \ door and locked it.  I felt myself grow wary.  Why were we locked into the store?\
  \  We froze into smiling tourist faces and continued to say \"no probably not tonight\"\
  , while our anxiety and awareness of our gender increased.  After what seemed an\
  \ uncomfortably lengthy time, he unlocked the door for us, but I believe both of\
  \ us knew that we had tread on dangerous ground.  He was not happy with us as we\
  \ left, and muttered to himself.    We were subdued and grateful to return safely\
  \ to our small hotel room that evening."
