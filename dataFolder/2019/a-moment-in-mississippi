Text: "We show up in the great blues town Clarksdale, Mississippi and it's dead, very\
  \ dead, I can't believe it has enough life to sustain itself. A tiny downtown of\
  \ seemingly four streets but still eight-storey buildings from gone heyday booms.\
  \ Everything closed down or abandoned, paint peeling.\n\tMy close friend Robbie\
  \ and I catapulted ourselves west out of LA, first with Craigslist rideshares then\
  \ hitchhiking. We ran out of rides in Little Rock, Arkansas, and, wanting control\
  \ over how we get lost, hired a shiny little red Yaris. We have two days to get\
  \ to New Orleans for July 4th, and barely enough money to hire the car for that.\n\
  \tIn Clarksdale, an old white lady with a melodic, thick local accent walks up to\
  \ us on the street. We tell her we\u2019re from Australia and ask where she\u2019\
  s from, she looks around spreads her arms, \u201Cright here.\u201D\n\t\u201CClarksdale\
  \ your whole life!\u201D Cheerful.\n\t\u201C81 years.\u201D\n\t\u201CWhere can we\
  \ get coffee around here?\u201D\n\t\u201COh Ground Zero, definitely Ground Zero.\u201D\
  \n\tThe most touristy blues bar, flags of visitors\u2019 countries, kitschy, sort\
  \ of fake graffiti writing on every surface. The sort of place we hate. But for\
  \ sure the only place in town with any life. A hectic young woman seemed to be manager,\
  \ strangely a lot of staff but not many people. There was a tension in the air.\
  \ We sat at the bar and struggled to get service. There were all these people in\
  \ nice shirts filing in, seats set up facing the stage. We were pretty keen to get\
  \ the hell out of there and on the road to stranger things, the last place I wanted\
  \ to be was dim indoors with the whole road and finite daylight there for us.\n\t\
  A chatty security guard poured us coffee. He kept wiping sweat from his forehead\
  \ with a towel, and had been to Australia twenty years earlier in his time in the\
  \ marines, like so many men we met in Mississippi. \"There's a wedding on, the two\
  \ guys in white shirts, they're getting married. It's the first gay wedding in this\
  \ county's history. We're all really proud for them,\" the law having passed only\
  \ a few days earlier legalising same-sex marriage across the US.\n\tTwo young Latino-American\
  \ guys, both waiters at this bar. A thin guy and a larger guy, who was crying by\
  \ the end. An older black male celebrant did it, the crowd family, friends and regulars,\
  \ the room was full now and energy packed. The manager gave the rings, her tearful\
  \ speech, hysterical, it meant so much to everyone. The security guard pointed out\
  \ one woman in a suit, \u201Cjournalist.\u201D Me and Robbie watched from the bar\
  \ stunned, high on the love and gravity of it. The crowd ended up raucous, the emotional\
  \ peak of all this, and they got married in front of a drum kit. It was all over\
  \ in 10 minutes. Everyone piled out, and the couple was photographed embracing by\
  \ a brick wall with a big love heart painted on, a dozen friends around them and\
  \ a dozen more taking photos.\n\tWe left behind Clarksdale to cut on, the afternoon\
  \ latening, howling down those arrow-straight back-town highways, next to cornfields\
  \ corn so close you could touch it flying past.\n\tInto towns still so poor and\
  \ small how were they there, on this farmlands towns string, we drive a few blocks\
  \ around one Gunnison, kids out playing, little tiny cafes and diners set up out\
  \ the front of little homes with porches and plastic chairs and menu signs next\
  \ to the front window...\n\tJust seeing two blocks off the main road magic, just\
  \ residential streets and houses, normal houses, streets where people live and get\
  \ up and go out to school and work, grow up and get in love. How was I here.\n\t\
  Mississippi all dull greens and hazy grey skies flattening farms and nothing towns.\n\
  \tOnwards the bright red Yaris and Kanye blasting, me and Robbie in America 2015,\
  \ he does 70-miles-an-hour-plus howling, tearing down we're bigger than the road,\
  \ bigger than the earth underneath us, shadows are closing in and it's still afternoon\
  \ so late on this longest day."
