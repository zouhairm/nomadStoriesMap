Text: "Today we found another entry for The Incomplete Guide to Fabulous Places: the\
  \ Abadia de Sacromonte.  \n\nWe did not plan to go there.  We just headed off in\
  \ a direction we hadn\u2019t gone before.  We suddenly found ourselves at its arched\
  \ entry gate and decided, why not?  Up we climbed, to a spot higher than the Alhambra,\
  \ which we could see in the distance below us.  \n\nWe saw a long low roof from\
  \ which erupted a diversity of cupolas, towers and skylights.  We had no idea what\
  \ could lie below; something weird and strange, no doubt.  \n\nAs the clock struck\
  \ eleven, the thick door to the abbey swung open.  A small vestibule led to a dramatic\
  \ renaissance courtyard full of orange trees.  A massive dripping fountain stood\
  \ at its center.  A young dark-haired woman escorted us to the ticket booth.  She\
  \ unlocked a cabinet and removed a red tin box where she kept the money.  We paid\
  \ our entrance fee.  \n\nFrom the grand courtyard our guide escorted us into the\
  \ abbey\u2019s impressive library. She told us the dubious origins of the abbey,\
  \ built within a century after the expulsion of the moors. The remaining Moriscos,\
  \ desperate to prove their Catholic ancestry, \u2018discovered\u2019 small stone\
  \ caskets that contained the ashes of eleven martyrs from the first century, including\
  \ those of Granada\u2019s patron saint.  \u201COf course, the documentation to justify\
  \ this discovery is scant and perhaps fraudulent,\u201D she confessed, \u201Cin\
  \ fact quite likely completely fraudulent.\u201D  The Moriscos fabricated a series\
  \ of twenty-some \u2018books,\u2019 engraved on bronze disks, each \u2018page\u2019\
  \ about four inches in diameter, which told of the common ancestry of the Moriscan\
  \ Christians and the Catholics.  The disks, written in Arabic and Greek, were alleged\
  \ to have been found in the lime kilns with the saints\u2019 remains.  \u201CThey\
  \ are obvious fabrications,\u201D she added, \u201Csince Arabic was not a written\
  \ language in the first century.\u201D The Catholics promptly slaughtered the Moriscos.\
  \ \n\nWe left the library. Our guide opened and closed doors until we arrived at\
  \ the church, heady with the smell of flowers. She picked up a long heavy key lying\
  \ on a lateral altar and opened a side door.  We crossed a small patio.  She unlocked\
  \ a low gate and we entered the \u2018caves.\u2019  These caves were excavated in\
  \ the sixteenth century down to a level beneath the alleged first century lime kilns\
  \ where the saints\u2019 remains were \u2018discovered.\u2019  The domes of the\
  \ kilns are now ceilings of tiny excavated chapels.  In between the domes of the\
  \ kilns, roughly hewn subterranean passages connect a series of more formal chapels,\
  \ built in different styles during subsequent periods.  We were doing the pilgrimage\
  \ in reverse, she explained.  \"You should enter the caves first, take the serpentine\
  \ paths between the different chapels and the candle-lit domes where the relics\
  \ were found, and emerge at the patio that leads to the church.\" \n\nSo the Abadia\
  \ of Sacromonte delivered: a fine courtyard, an impressive library, a lovely church\
  \ and then the weird carnival of caves, all served up inside a legend of martyrdom\
  \ that may never have occurred.   \n\nWhat of the twentieth century will remain\
  \ in five hundred years?  \n\nOn my flight from Madrid, two Spanish women sat behind\
  \ me, a woman with Down\u2019s syndrome and her caretaker. As we sat on the tarmac,\
  \ speakers in the airplane played popular classics.  One that will persist beyond\
  \ the twentieth century entered our shared space: Louis Armstrong sang in his husky\
  \ voice What a Wonderful World.  The woman with Down\u2019s joined in, singing the\
  \ words in a loud, tuneless and high-pitched voice, a voice like nails on a chalkboard.\
  \  For me it was a minute of irritable and yet ecstatic dissonance.  Her disability,\
  \ her enthusiasm, superimposed over the purity of that brief simple ditty, made\
  \ me think of the intimacy that those tourists five hundred years from now will\
  \ have with the long-dead people of the twentieth century. It will be Louis Armstrong\u2019\
  s voice they will hear.  It will be Charlie Chaplin\u2019s face they will see. \
  \ Armstrong\u2019s brief song ended.  I assume the Spanish woman fell asleep. She\
  \ caused no further commotion until our arrival in Newark when, to the exasperation\
  \ of her attendant, she vomited after landing."
