Text: "We landed in Lisboa (local for Lisbon), Portugal via Valencia without much\
  \ expectations, after memorable experiences in France and Spain. But hold on - it\
  \ was a pleasant surprise for us, as we have experienced  in almost all our trips\
  \ the last leg of the trip is the most amazing. So here we were in Portugal, amazing\
  \ last leg of our Europe trip. \n\nThe people came across as very friendly and helpful\
  \ too, in fact this is the first time I experienced a hostel which had a common\
  \ dormitory. Most of the chores, had to be done by ourselves, and to tell you the\
  \ fast it was quite unique staying with travelers all around the world. We bumped\
  \ into a German traveler in the same hostel, the places which we saw in Lisbon because\
  \ of him, we couldn't had covered on our own. \n\nThough we had great expectations\
  \ about France and Spain, it was Portugal which surprised me most, as a package,\
  \ be it amazing palaces, castles, climate, monuments, history, its people and much\
  \ more. I didnt expect to find such a colorful country. Given a chance I would like\
  \ to visit one more time, the places which we planned earlier, but missed due to\
  \ only for days in out hands."
