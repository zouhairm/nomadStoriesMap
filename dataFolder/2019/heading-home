Text: "Heading Home\n\nDad arrived in Australia as a young refugee fleeing the Vietnam\
  \ War. It was around 50 years later when I was able to return to his home to meet\
  \ the cousins, aunties and uncles I had never known. Honestly, I had never learnt\
  \ much of my Vietnamese heritage, and it was excitement, but also hesitation, that\
  \ I boarded the plane for my first overseas trip\u2026 \n\nI arrived in Ho Chi Minh\
  \ City (Saigon to dad) as the setting sun started to be replaced by the glow of\
  \ neon lights. As we stepped out of the airport, the humidity engulfed me, but it\
  \ was nothing compared to the large group of people that had quickly surrounded\
  \ us \u2013 their smiles unknown but strangely familiar. Names were said, and forgotten,\
  \ hugs were shared and then 20 relatives and myself boarded into a mini van headed\
  \ to dad\u2019s hometown Ba Ria. I instantly knew the language barrier would be\
  \ a problem. As a child, I refused to go to Vietnamese school and now I found myself\
  \ in Vietnam for three weeks, with only dad who spoke English. \n\nOutside the streets\
  \ of Saigon were like nothing I had ever seen. Cars, scooters and pedestrians covered\
  \ every bit of road and sidewalk, but surprisingly they all danced around each other\
  \ cohesively. There seemed to be no road rules, but somehow the chaos worked. Inside\
  \ the van, relatives were laughing and juggling around cups of iced coffee coming\
  \ from a 20L jug cooler placed in the aisle. C\xE0 ph\xEA s\u1EEFa \u0111\xE1 would\
  \ go on to be my most consumed drink over the next few weeks, usually drinking it\
  \ for breakfast, morning and afternoon tea.  \n\nAs we made our way out of the city,\
  \ the scenery slowly changed. The roads got bumpier, and the flashing, neon lights\
  \ and concrete structures opened up into vast rice fields and endless darkness.\
  \ It was late when we turned onto the last dirt road and arrived at our destination.\
  \ The family home was basic; one main room, the kitchen, bathroom and two bedrooms.\
  \ It was insisted I was given one bedroom, while most of the family started laying\
  \ down thin mattresses and pillows over the main room\u2019s floor. We sat down\
  \ together to watch a Vietnamese soap opera, until finally with polite smiles and\
  \ a goodnight I retreated into the bedroom. \n\nI should have been thrilled at the\
  \ prospect of exploring a new place and getting to know more about my family, and\
  \ I was. But as I lay there on my first night, even though I was in a house full\
  \ of people, I felt strangely isolated and alone\u2026"
