Text: "As soon as I reached Nahargarh fort, a beautiful soul, standing beside the\
  \ road welcomed me with a big warm smile.\nNahargarh fort is located approximately\
  \ at a height of 700 ft and 15 km away from Jaipur city of Rajasthan, India.\nThis\
  \ beautiful woman in yellow and blue lehenga choli (traditional Rajasthani attire),\
  \ round nose pin and jhumkas (earrings) was standing outside citadel like a blooming\
  \ bud in sun. She was selling guavas there. I was starving since morning I asked\
  \ her for some guavas. While she was cutting those guavas for me I had a little\
  \ talk with her in which she shared her everyday experiences with me. \nOn asking\
  \ about her home, She said that she lives in the main city, which is approximately\
  \ 20kms away. For money she has to come every morning, leaving two small kids behind.\
  \ \n\"You're tough!\" I said after hearing her experiences. On which she replied\
  \ \"When you have two kids at home, and you know what kind of upbringing you want\
  \ for them, every struggle is worth.\"\nI was amazed by listening her experiences.\
  \ Her experiences were awe-inspiring. She was standing there in scorching sun for\
  \ a good life for her children. \nI loved her spirit. The best part about her is\
  \ that she had narrated me all her experiences with a big smile on her face. Without\
  \ a single demand of sympathy. \nI think that's what a modern women is like. Strong,\
  \ Relentless, Gritty and firmly Determined. \nWomen are strong and relentless. And\
  \ it's time they own it. They aren't damsel in distress. They are the warriors."
