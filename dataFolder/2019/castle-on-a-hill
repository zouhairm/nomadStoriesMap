Text: "One cold night in Edinburgh, my eyes locked with a beautiful blonde South African\
  \ man across the beer pong table. The hostel tournament was in full swing and I\
  \ was going to win. It's just like how all romantic stories begin.\n\nAfter a surprising\
  \ defeat, the hostel staff took us on a mini pub crawl to a bar with live music\
  \ and, more importantly, double gin & tonics for less than \xA33. It didn\u2019\
  t take many doubles until we were on the dance floor. He had moves; twirling me\
  \ around and dipping me, taking the prime opportunity to lean in for a kiss. Before\
  \ we knew it, it was 3 am and he suggested we go on a bit of an adventure.\n\nIn\
  \ Edinburgh, one of the main sites is the castle perched up on a hill overlooking\
  \ the city. Our hostel was by the nearby so it was only natural to check it out\
  \ before heading back. Upon the hill we stood there overlooking the lit up city,\
  \ chatting about life (as you do). It snowed lightly so we held each other close\
  \ for warmth, not ready to leave this incredible spot. It was so quiet, as though\
  \ we were the only people in the city.\n\nWhen the cold snow turned to rain and\
  \ it became too much, we went back to the hostel and sat on a leather couch by a\
  \ twinkling Christmas tree. I laid across his lap and we kept chatting not ready\
  \ to say goodbye. It was my first night in Edinburgh but it was his last. Eventually,\
  \ we kissed goodnight and said goodbye.\n\nI didn't expect to have a romantic movie\
  \ meet-cute on my weekend trip, but I look back on that night with fondness."
