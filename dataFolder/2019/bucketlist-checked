Text: "Definately it is not easy to decide where to spent my yearly holiday, was thinking\
  \ about exploring few metropolitan cities with it's lights, highest buildings, and\
  \ nightlife to chill the day. \n\nEver since I worked for an airline 15 years ago,\
  \ handled many people flew to Tbilisi, I have no idea what kind of the city is,\
  \ but it kept in my mind that someday, yes someday I should be able to go to this\
  \ place. Put this city as my bucketlist which I don't even know when I get a chance\
  \ to visit.\n\nStarted to get as much as information on a city called Tbilisi, in\
  \ a country called Georgia. From my hometown - Indonesia, I should traveled half\
  \ of the world probably to get to that city. When all my documents are done, early\
  \ this year I travelled, yes I did travel to Tbilisi. \n\nArrived morning at around\
  \ 5.30am in a cold winter time, i found Tbilisi is such an amazing city, the taxi\
  \ driver was drop me in front of the building of the apartment I rented, waited\
  \ and seated perfectly beside my black big luggage. I just realized that I can only\
  \ be able to check in on 2.00pm Tbilisi time.\n\nHonestly, I have no idea with their\
  \ languages, only few people understand English, even in a restaurant when i tried\
  \ to get some breakfast, I communicated with my hands and expression - I believe\
  \ this called body language.\n\nHave no friends or relatives, but i feel just safe\
  \ to travel alone to this city, Georgian if I may say are different, they don't\
  \ push if we say no, they make me feel comfortable and safe.\n\nThe next day, i\
  \ decided to see the Kazbegi - I was informed the immigration officer that I want\
  \ to see the Kazbegi when the officer asked me why I came to her country. Kazbegi,\
  \ never been here before, just saw the pictures on the internet, read few review\
  \ about the place, I definately didn't expect that Kazbegi is unbelievable beautiful.\n\
  \nWent through Zhinvali water reservoir, this is the first time also i tried 1 shot\
  \ of cha cha, i may said the taste is like tequila but....wow more strong! Prices\
  \ was surprisingly only 1 lari, imagined if I can sell it in my hometown - well\
  \ just a crazy thoughts.\n\nThe road to Kazbegi is surrounded by snowy mountain\
  \ which I never seen before, especially in my hometown, a tropical country. Fresh\
  \ air with beautiful scenery driven me crazy, I was thinking to screaming out loud\
  \ because of my happines witnessed the beauty.\n\nI knew it seems so irritating,\
  \ but I don't care I never saw tons of snow like that. \n\nVisited Orthodox churches\
  \ and tried to understand the history made me realized how beauty the world is,\
  \ with it's ancient history, people, cultures and many more. This made myself eagerly\
  \ wanted to travel more and explore more."
