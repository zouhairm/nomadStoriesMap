Text: "Leaving is the verb that I like most about the whole dictionary.\nSweden in\
  \ my head has always been a distant, different place and In five minutes, to push\
  \ myself I decided to go to Stockholm.\nI landed at night and as soon as I started\
  \ walking on Swedish soil I felt the magic of that part of the world.\nI explored\
  \ everything alone, it's not difficult, everything seems perfect and works, like\
  \ train and metro. It's not so grey How was in my mind. \nBut the last day I found\
  \ myself in a remote area of the city, in the cold and in the dark, the mobile phone\
  \ drained and a little scaried. \nA gentle man probably saw me, I was almost cried\
  \ and he came up to offer me a hot chocolate.\nI was scared but he started talking\
  \ as if we had always known each other. He told me about his life, and decision\
  \ he made. \nI decided to start him so I also said a lot of thing I had in my mind,\
  \ that i want to become a traveller writer but I am scared. He told me that I have\
  \ to do only things that make me happy, life can change and I have the power to\
  \ do it. \nHe became a friend.\nThanks Stockholm for showing me the beauty of solidarity.\n\
  You were always in my mind."
