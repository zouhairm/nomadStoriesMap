Text: "Its there. \n\nYou feel it. \n\nThat itch. Its not a physical itch but rather\
  \ this feeling you have at the back of your skull, deep in your chest, asking for\
  \ you to do something to relieve it. \nYou tell yourself that it\u2019s just passing\
  \ feeling, that you have \u201Cwork to do\u201D and that you don\u2019t have time\
  \ to just sit and day dream about the unknowns or what-ifs and go back to that gigantic\
  \ list of emails and tune it out.\n\nBut sometimes in the evenings after work you\
  \ allow yourself to humor that itch. You think about life outside that regular 9\
  \ to 5, or what a real vacation would feel like. You are so deep in thought you\
  \ can almost taste the saltiness of the ocean, and the heat of the sun on your skin.\
  \ Your ready to dive into that deep blue ocean when suddenly, you hear the sound\
  \ of a police siren, whizzing by your house. Reality checks in, and you realize\
  \ you\u2019re still sitting in that little apartment you can barely afford, eating\
  \ cereal for dinner because cooking takes time, and you\u2019re out of it right\
  \ now. \n\nThis isn\u2019t the first or the last time your going to feel this way.\
  \ You know that itch is going to continue. You\u2019ve even talked to your family\
  \ about it. How you have this feeling that this kind of business life just isn\u2019\
  t for you, and that you need to discover what\u2019s out there in the world. Every\
  \ day, you end up telling someone this and needless to say, the response is never\
  \ positive. It\u2019s the same old, \u201Chow could you?\u201D Or, a personal favorite\
  \ \u201CYou\u2019re not bold enough for that kind of adventure.\u201D  \n\nThat\
  \ one hits you. And for a while, you let yourself believe this. \n\nYou find yourself\
  \ making excuses like not enough resources, not enough time this year, not the right\
  \ people to go with. And ya they\u2019re right, maybe you aren\u2019t that bold.\
  \ You sit there and blame every outside force, and yourself, and let that itch turn\
  \ into an ache. \n\nThat ache begins to eat away at you. You think about it while\
  \ staring down that screen at work. On your hour and a half commute. While you\u2019\
  re out with that group of friends your trying way too hard to fit into. It\u2019\
  s difficult to just go about a day without thinking of the unknowns and What-ifs.\
  \ And all that worry and doubt you\u2019ve listened to over and over again just\
  \ comes up in your head when you least expect it. And for some reason it\u2019s\
  \ not just about the what-ifs anymore its more than that and\n\nGet. A. Hold. Of.\
  \ Yourself. \nBreathe. \nIn for four, hold, out for eight. \n\nYou go for a walk.\
  \ Air yourself out. Come back inside sit at your kitchen table, piecing together\
  \ whats going on. The reality of the situation is that your ache has become a pit.\
  \ You weren\u2019t listening to the itch when it was telling you to explore, or\
  \ to find your passion. Instead of allowing yourself to get out of your comfort\
  \ zone and try something you\u2019ve always dreamed of, you\u2019ve shyed away and\
  \ held onto these deep seeded insecurities. More than anything, you realize that\
  \ it\u2019s time for a change. Maybe its time you did give up that job that doesn\u2019\
  t make you happy. Maybe become okay with letting go of toxic attitudes that you\
  \ hear from others and trade in those negative feelings you\u2019ve internalized\
  \ for something positive. \n\nIts time to live for you. What that looks like exactly,\
  \ you\u2019re not quite sure. But you know its not here. And now, you\u2019ve realized\
  \ that\u2019s okay. You begin by taking out your pen and notebook and writing down\
  \ the things you want without limiting your hearts desires or creativity. As you\
  \ do this, three themes stick out among the rest. \n\nExploration. Travel. Happiness.\
  \ \n\nWithout all the negativity and doubt you\u2019ve put on yourself, you realize\
  \ these things are attainable. But the question is, will you allow yourself to try?"
