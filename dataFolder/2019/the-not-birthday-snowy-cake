Text: "The total silence in the magic forest, the hugest cone that I\u2019ve ever\
  \ seen, the majestic Etna, and my Sicilian hero. No, I don\u2019t want to tell you\
  \ an incredible story that happened on my birthday, I\u2019m just going to show\
  \ you how it might be odd to meet somebody who understands you better than you understand\
  \ yourself.\n\nSo, on the second day of my landing in Sicily, I booked a tour to\
  \ Etna. I thought it would be great to not celebrate my birthday at the peak of\
  \ the volcano. We, I mean two couples from Canada and Great Britain, two guides,\
  \ named Andrea and Mladen, and a little hobbit from Russia \u2013 me, started our\
  \ way to Catania. Our promising journey was stopped as quickly as it began \u2013\
  \ the van broke down from one hour from Etna. We decided to wait for a new car and\
  \ pass the time in the forest\u2019s small cafe. I bought a gorgeous cake. At this\
  \ moment, one pretty sad dog came to me. I gave it everything that it wanted \u2013\
  \ my \u2018not birthday cake\u2019.\n\n\u201CHappy birthday!\u201D Mladen smiled.\
  \ He had stolen up on me while I was feeding the dog.\n\u201CTssss,\u201D I whispered,\
  \ \u201CI don\u2019t want anybody to find out.\u201D\n\n\u201CYou should enjoy it.\
  \ You know I also celebrated my birthday here last year. When you booked this trip,\
  \ I thought you would do the same.\u201D After this, he always noticed where I was:\
  \ my every step, my every smile, my every word.  \n\nThe new van picked us up. Etna\
  \ met our company with snowy hugs and volcanic smiles. It was like a Soviet ice\
  \ cream with chocolate wrinkles. Mladen was as happy as a kid who was looking at\
  \ something great for the first time. \u201CI\u2019m not Italian,\u201D he told\
  \ me. \u201CI was born in Bosnia and Herzegovina. My parents were killed in the\
  \ war and one Sicilian family adopted me,\u201D he was very matter-of-fact about\
  \ his childhood.\n\n\u201COk, Cinderella,\u201D I called him so as to make him smile\
  \ and change the serious tone of our conversation, \u201CLet\u2019s go say hi to\
  \ Etna.\u201D We laughed a lot, he hugged me and threw snowballs at me. I don\u2019\
  t remember when I was so happy and felt a childish freedom. \u201CIf you\u2019re\
  \ a hobbit, I am Legolas, but with brown hair,\u201D Mladen joked. And I painfully\
  \ thought, \u201CMay I be loved and fall in love again?\u201D The snowball, like\
  \ my tear, was falling down into the crater.\n\n\u201CI\u2019m going to take a photo\
  \ of you jumping in the air,\u201D I said.\n\u201CI don\u2019t have such photos,\u201D\
  \ he was curious.\n\nYou know, this birthday topped my list of \u201CBest anti-birthday\
  \ celebration\u201D."
