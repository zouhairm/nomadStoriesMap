Text: "If somebody would have told me: \"This will be the most beautiful church you'll\
  \ ever see in a lifetime\", I would have never believed them. And yet\u2026\n\n\u201C\
  Is that supposed to be a church?\u201D I ask my boyfriend.\nRight in front of me,\
  \ I see a square-based building eaten away by time. The central tower, the one that\
  \ is supposed to host a bell, has an incomplete roof.\n\u201CDoesn\u2019t it look\
  \ like a stretched hand trying to reach for the sky that, exhausted, gave up on\
  \ its quest?\u201D I say. \nHe chuckles: \u201CYes, I guess so\u201D.\n\nThe building\
  \ stands in the middle of Berlin\u2019s richest neighbor. The worn out, beige, old\
  \ church definitely pops out among all the glass and concrete skyscrapers, whose\
  \ windows reflect the tint of the sunny sky. My boyfriend and I are stepping up\
  \ the stairs that welcome visitors. Above us, three heavily embellished arches and\
  \ a rose window without its glass. As I enter, I expect to see a bunch of ruins,\
  \ sand-colored stones, maybe a white marble altar... instead, I remain speechless.\n\
  The church is a beautiful work of art, decorated according to the Byzantine style,\
  \ although it was built in the 19th century. My eyes look frenetically left and\
  \ right, up and down, trying to capture in one glance all the magnificence of this\
  \ place. Green flowers forming a seamless pattern adorn the white floor. I glance\
  \ at the ceiling while my jaw drops: I stand underneath a round portrait of an emperor\
  \ created by millions of small golden and colored mosaic pieces. Behind the small\
  \ desk offering souvenirs to my left, the church ends in a semicircle. Along these\
  \ walls, there are several panels telling the tragic story of Kaiser-Wilhelm Ged\xE4\
  chtniskirche, which was bombarded at the end of the Second World War and never rebuilt.\n\
  Old pictures and scale model show visitors how big the church actually was; we can\
  \ only appreciate a third of it all. \nI can\u2019t help but feel the weight of\
  \ history upon myself. I am born in the lucky side of the world, I don\u2019t really\
  \ know what \"war\" is and I hope I will never find out.\nI suffer thinking at how\
  \ much we lose while we are too busy fighting each other on a base of some stupid\
  \ differences in skin color, religion or country that in the end, don\u2019t matter\
  \ at all. So much beauty taken down in the name of power. Men are able to create\
  \ wonderful things, and yet we are also able to destroy them so quickly. I leave\
  \ with a strange weight on my chest and the hope that history will not repeat itself."
