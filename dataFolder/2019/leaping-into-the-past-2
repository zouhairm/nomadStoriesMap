Text: "On May 26, 2017, I relocated back to a place that every fiber in my being did\
  \ not want to be. Initially, I fought it, while at the same time knowing that it\
  \ was something that I was supposed to do. That day, the life that I had built in\
  \ Atlanta, Georgia ended.  I and another friend of mine packed up the trunk of my\
  \ small silver Toyota Yaris. Each of us having half of the trunk respectively for\
  \ our belongings, and we left with our sons.  While not quite sure what our next\
  \ steps would be,  we were filled with a guided peace that still resonates within\
  \ us to this day.  I drove away from my home, my husband, the business I had built,\
  \ and acquaintances that could not understand why the life that I was living was\
  \ no longer serving me.  They couldn\u2019t see that in my beautiful home, with\
  \ beautiful family pictures that lined the walls, there was an energy that was suffocating\
  \ me.  In between the tufts of smoke from the incense that burned that lingered\
  \ in the air until it disappeared, was the painful stench of emotional abuse. A\
  \ stench that no incense could ever cover up.  In between the fibers of the carpet\
  \ was the residue of tears, and if you listened close enough, you could hear the\
  \ walls cry. \n                Upon returning to the Cleveland area, I was blessed\
  \ to have everything fall into place. My leap into my old world with my new reality\
  \ could have been worse. While getting adjusted, I knew I had unfinished business\
  \ that I had to attend to. I thought Atlanta, Georgia would be my last stop but\
  \ I was wrong.  I had lived so many of my formidable years in Cleveland.  Years\
  \ that brought events that caused me so much confusion, disappointment, and pain,\
  \ but I knew deep down inside there was a deeper reason for my return that was much\
  \ bigger than me.  \n\tDuring the years I originally lived in Cleveland, my family\
  \ fell apart. Both of my brothers mysteriously vanished.  They had become two of\
  \ the many victims plagued by mental illness. Upon my return, I was determined to\
  \ find them.  I found one of my brothers in a group home, struggling with the disease\
  \ of alcohol addiction. I found the other, on the brink of homelessness, not taking\
  \ his medication and extremely ill.  They had not seen each other in over 15 years.\
  \  As the months passed, they were reunited. They began to talk and spend time together\
  \ again\u2026we all did.  It was something  I never thought I would ever experience\
  \ again in my life.  My sister even traveled to Cleveland to be with us, to experience\
  \ family. Something many people take for granted, but for us it was a miracle.\n\
  \tIn March of 2018, my oldest brother so bravely began his battle with the disease\
  \ of alcohol addiction.  We attended meetings almost daily.  He began to see a light\
  \ and taste the sweet nectar of recovery.  I saw a light in his eyes that I had\
  \ not seen since childhood. For the first time in a long time, he began to understand,\
  \ that he was not powerless.  On May 18, 2018, while in the midst of his recovery,\
  \ he experienced a pulmonary embolism and just like that, he was gone. \n\tInitially,\
  \ truth be told, I almost lost my mind.  However, after a while, I forced myself\
  \ to use clear vision. I realized that I could have stayed in my beautiful home\
  \ in Atlanta with the crying walls and tear stained carpet. Instead, I chose to\
  \ follow my intuition and I spared myself the dull ache of regret that would have\
  \ plagued me had I not been here to experience my brother\u2019s final years on\
  \ this planet.  My siblings would have never been reunited and I would have missed\
  \ his final smiles and laughs and hearing him say the words \u201CI love you\u201D\
  .  My leap, afforded me a sense of peace that is priceless and if I had the chance,\
  \ I would leap just as high all over again."
