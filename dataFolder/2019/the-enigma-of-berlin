Text: "Berlin is not one city, but two \u2013 divided into day and night. After dark\
  \ it is possessed by an indescribable heaviness that lifts with the morning to briefly\
  \ reveal a light, spacious city, only to descend again. During the day Berlin can\
  \ forget, but at night its enigmatic past takes hold, wrapping you in memories.\
  \ \n\nBerlin does not tell its past, but bears it like the lines of a hand; the\
  \ graffiti scored on the Soviet flats and Prussian monuments record the years as\
  \ they pile up and weigh on the city. After dark, the graffiti turns black and white\
  \ and transforms into a spectre of the past-nights. It watches the present and unloads\
  \ its memories in silence. \n\nMy story takes place in the summer of 2014. I had\
  \ already spent a few days walking around Kreuzberg\u2019s colourful daytime streets,\
  \ entranced by the bright city and impervious to its heavy enigmatic twin. I had\
  \ been out at night, but had managed to stay (figuratively) within the daytime-city.\
  \ \n\nThen, suddenly, the weight of Berlin\u2019s memories flooded in, the graffiti\
  \ became spectral and the city clove in two. This happened while I was sitting on\
  \ a metal chair outside a caf\xE9 in the half-light of evening, when a man told\
  \ me the story of a murder that had taken place three weeks ago on The Beach.\n\n\
  The Beach was a riverside settlement in the east of Kreuzberg. One section of it\
  \ was a makeshift community overlooking the Spree, built on imported river-sand\
  \ and littered with Persian rugs, bicycles, armchairs, tepees and small tents. The\
  \ other section stretched around the corner. It was larger and contained more permanent-looking\
  \ residences, with washing draped over thin string and corrugated iron doors painted\
  \ with patterns. \n\nTo give any single classification of the inhabitants of The\
  \ Beach would be impossible; I remember a haggard woman in her thirties shuffling\
  \ around on the sand in heels and fishnet tights and a group of old Caribbean-looking\
  \ men sat staring wistfully across the river smoking pipes. Young people with skateboards\
  \ were arranged compact and cross-legged in close circles. A couple were leaning\
  \ over the edge of the river, their feet hanging down beside a rope that attached\
  \ a small raft to the shore. Scores of children with bare feet and wispy hair wove\
  \ their way through all of this. \n\nOne of the barefoot children (dressed in bright\
  \ red with almond-shaped eyes) had spoken to me asking for water I didn\u2019t have.\
  \ During our brief conversation in broken German she giggled and used the informal\
  \ \u2018du\u2019 before dissolving into a side-street. It seemed for a second that\
  \ she could have been some small newly painted mural, momentarily detached from\
  \ the wall before being pulled back in. She walked lightly, almost silently, embodying\
  \ the bright, modern, quiet expanse that these streets were during the day. My picture\
  \ of The Beach, bathed in sunlight and colour made the man\u2019s story seem impossible.\n\
  \nThe murder was a family affair, he told me. The family were not from the city,\
  \ so the police took only a fleeting interest in the case and ultimately the whole\
  \ thing silently blew away. In short: an argument had arisen at around midnight,\
  \ escalated and culminated in two corpses, which were then burnt somewhere on the\
  \ sand. The black and white spectral graffiti would have watched it all.\n\nThe\
  \ almond-eyed child and the murder left Berlin divided in my mind; not one city,\
  \ but two. My subsequent days were spent obsessed with the night and the ability\
  \ of its collective memory to so suddenly rear its head and pour out its heaviness.\
  \ \n\nIt was only during my last few hours in Berlin that I was shown one fragile\
  \ link between the two cities. Throughout Kreuzberg there were small windmills in\
  \ the trees, each attached to a radio. When the windmills began to turn, they generated\
  \ electricity that set off their radio, filling the streets of Kreuzberg with random,\
  \ intermittent music. This happened throughout the day and night - the gusts of\
  \ wind that set off these radios moved through both cities, impervious to heaviness\
  \ or lightness."
