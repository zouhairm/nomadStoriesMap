Text: "My existence in those moments, was nothing more than a small dot of consciousness,\
  \ striving to be careful on the small muddy width of land between the depth of the\
  \ valley and the mountainous road, while walking on the roads in the isle of Arran.\
  \ It was peaceful to have myself zoomed out for two days.There were certain moments\
  \ where it felt safe to turn back but it paradoxically felt safer to tread ahead\
  \ into the unknown distance that I had to travel till I reached a point where I\
  \ could take a bus back to the Lochranza youth hostel where I had put up.\nOn the\
  \ first day I had decided to walk till Pirnmill, which was just a stop in the wild\
  \ wilderness. The map reassured me like a protective parent that it wasn't a long\
  \ way from where I was, though in reality it was actually quite a distance to walk.\
  \ I made it to Pirnmill just in time to catch the last bus bound for the hostel.\
  \ \n\nHaving reached Lochranza, I took a warm shower and set out for a small meal\
  \ in the nearby Lochranza hotel. While I always feel conscious to eat alone at a\
  \ restaurant or a pub, this time I found refuge in my book 'Sydney to London-The\
  \ Long Ride Home' by Nathan Millward and enjoyed a tender haddock cooked in beer\
  \ and served with chips. Fish and chips are found everywhere in Scotland but you\
  \ definitely should not miss it while you are around the coastal areas. \n\nThe\
  \ next day I was out of the hostel by 8:30 a.m. I was sure I would feel safe and\
  \ comfortable walking in the bright daylight. I had planned to walk upto Brodick\
  \ harbour from my hostel, which was roughly about one-fourth of the stretch of the\
  \ isle ( approximately 25 km)\nI started walking and was actually taken aback by\
  \ what I felt after walking for one hour. It was not the time of the day that mattered\
  \ or the fear of wild animals or the fear of being raped. No, there was something\
  \ else to it. I was in the middle of nowhere. Yes I was somewhere between Lochranza\
  \ and Sannox but for me 'somewhere' had to feel like a place where you could halt,\
  \ in the sense of being in touch with humans. And here I was on the roads with nothing\
  \ around but wilderness. It was this insecurity brought about by detachment from\
  \ living souls that was haunting me, a profound realisation for a traveller who\
  \ was determined to seek peace in solitude! \n\nI kept walking and then stopped\
  \ at the Corrie tea room to take away a sandwich with baked vegetables and goatcheese.\
  \ I enjoyed every bit of it sitting on a stretch of rock, which pushed its way into\
  \ the sea. \nI reached my destination at last, detouring at times, visiting the\
  \ Brodick castle and shopping some junk jewellery, from a local shop. Later I took\
  \ a bus to Lamlash and Whiting bay. I was happy I had achieved what I had planned\
  \ for the day. \n\nThe next day it was pouring heavily. I and Martina, the girl\
  \ I made friends with on the way to the isle, got into a bus and reached the Glenashdale\
  \ falls and the Giant's graves. We plucked berries on our way while we walked through\
  \ the jungle, chatting away about our life. It was kind of funny how coincidentally\
  \ we kept bumping into each other throughout the trip as if we kept returning to\
  \ each other like the most careless people on earth, to take and give something\
  \ we had forgotten the last time we met. \n\nI reached Glasgow on the 8th of September\
  \ after staying for two nights in the isle. You have to do a solo trip sometime\
  \ in your life and may be you will feel what I felt. Believe me, it was not a big\
  \ deal finding a flashing moment of solitude, it isn't that amazing as it is hyped\
  \ to be but remember not everything on earth is hyped, only the things which have\
  \ some potential to stand out, are!"
