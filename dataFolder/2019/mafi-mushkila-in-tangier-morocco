Text: "The first time we visited Morocco, my husband did all of the planning for our\
  \ trip. Airline schedules, overnight accommodations, train routes \u2014 everything\
  \ was thoroughly researched and beautifully mapped out well in advance. When we\
  \ got off the ferry in Tangier and were ready to hire a cab to take us to our riad,\
  \ we wound up with a battered old jalopy driven by a man who didn\u2019t speak a\
  \ single word of English. We did a lot of map pointing and nodding among the three\
  \ of us, loaded the luggage, and were on our way.\n\nMike\u2019s Arabic was rusty\
  \ after 25 years, but as we bounced over hills and careened around the curves of\
  \ the coastal road, he taught me some phrases I would need while we were in Tangier\
  \ and Marrakech. Salaam alaykum: Greetings! Shukran: Thank you. Na\u2019am: Yes.\
  \ Laa: No.\n\nIt was nice to have the distraction, because the driver was going\
  \ at breakneck speed through the little villages and herds of goats. I was certain\
  \ the car was going to fall apart at any minute or else we would fly right off the\
  \ road and over the cliff into the sea. As we barreled around a particularly sharp\
  \ curve, the keys actually flew out of the ignition \u2026 and the car kept running.\
  \  \n\nWe looked at each other in shock. After a moment, Mike shrugged his shoulders\
  \ and said, \u201CMafi mushkila!\u201D The cab driver burst out laughing and repeated,\
  \ \u201CMafi mushkila! Mafi mushkila,\u201D his first words to us during the whole\
  \ ride.\n\nThat Arabic phrase, which means \u201Cno problem,\u201D has since become\
  \ one of my favorites. When the best-laid plans go awry, it\u2019s a reminder that\
  \ everything is still fine. We have done our best, and even if things aren\u2019\
  t perfect, the world has not ended."
