Text: "The sea is wafting in on a sunny summer breeze today; an interval of reprieve\
  \ after such blazing heat. Anyone who has passed through my hometown caf\xE9 in\
  \ Greenport has seen Aldo\u2019s collection of rum on the top shelves of the coffee\
  \ bar, including the iconic Havana Club.\n\nI grew up an islander hopping between\
  \ the North Fork, Shelter Island, and Manhattan for as long as I can remember. There\
  \ has always been so much debate about what it means to be local on the East End.\
  \ Although I have been on the North Fork my whole life, I grew up with a displaced\
  \ sense of identity having always yearned for a motherland. In pursuit of my own\
  \ Latin American identity, it occurred to me that I had to see Havana. It was a\
  \ gut feeling. It seemed that whatever I was hungry for I would find there.\n\n\
  Havana is a city in limbo whose economy relies entirely on tourism. It is a city\
  \ that endures between a generation who grew up alongside La Revoluci\xF3n and the\
  \ youth who do not associate with it. I arrived shortly after Hurricane Irene and\
  \ Maria hit, disasters that exacerbated already existing issues in Cuba. Havana\
  \ had recovered swiftly, but by word of mouth I heard that the farms had suffered\
  \ a great deal. And you could sense it. Aside from the normal restrictions that\
  \ existed, there were times when there were no eggs, no tomatoes, no coffee. There\
  \ was even a shortage of napkins. At one paladar I ordered a half roasted chicken\
  \ that seemed to have starved to death. Dining in Havana was very telling of the\
  \ state of economy for Cubans. And as I was told: the fish was set-aside for tourists.\
  \ That is not to say not all Cubans ate well, but many are food insecure despite\
  \ their monthly allotments. That is the reality.\n\nLa Guarida is considered the\
  \ most elegant restaurant in Havana that can satisfy even the most exigent of tastes.\
  \ The space was charged with history and dwelling. At once I felt lost in time as\
  \ if I were inside a castle and a wooden ship, simultaneously living and traversing.\
  \ The walls were riddled with family photographs of transient guests. Upon sitting\
  \ I realized that I\u2019d be dining besides the likes of Robert DeNiro, Uma Thurman,\
  \ Gael Garcia Bernal, Beyonc\xE9 & Jay Z. My jaw dropped just in time for dinner,\
  \ which then immediately crumbled in disbelief. If you could taste Hemingway\u2019\
  s \u201CThe Old Man and the Sea,\u201D it would taste like their smoked marlin tacos:\
  \ wholesome, perfumed, and simple. But while my whole dining experience was exceptional,\
  \ I longed for the conviviality of a home cooked meal. In my experience, true Latin\
  \ hood is witnessed inside the home. My hosts made me a meal that showed the same\
  \ meticulous care as La Guarida; a daiquir\xED better than from La Floridita (sorry\
  \ Ernest). Food was a reflection of wealth, but its execution was a demonstration\
  \ of hospitality and cultural pride that existed beyond the restrictions of their\
  \ regime. \u201CServir es mi mejor manera de hablar.\u201D Translation: to serve\
  \ is my best way to speak.\n\nI left Havana with a question I read inside a book\
  \ off the cobbled stoned street called Obispo. It was about the way Cuban identity\
  \ had been shaped throughout its history. While not necessarily my answer, Havana\
  \ did give me a thought to consider. For any migrant, islander, pilgrim, or gypsy\
  \ who has ever looked out and wondered what was past the edge of the sea: \u201C\
  Are we who have emerged, or the remnants of what has sunk?\u201D"
