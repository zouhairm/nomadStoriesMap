Text: "The first time that i visited Europe was last summer, I did the basics I mean\
  \ Paris, Italy , Prague, Holland, Belgium, Switzerland and Germany. The last one\
  \ is regarding I will talk:\nI remember that the first stop in the country was koln,\
  \ you must travel by train because in that way you can see the spectacular gothic\
  \ church. It\u2019s somethig scared because .. . you only have to put a feet in\
  \ the street to see the big church .. that\u2019s will cover all your landscape\
  \ .. you can\u2019t expect that the first thing you will see a soon you left the\
  \ train station it\u2019s the church .. I  saw every detail .. in a view of 360\
  \ . I could have the first picture about the German life ... they close all on sundays\
  \ , they love the summer and care the environment.. by the way yes they are a little\
  \ bit serious...\n\nAfter koln next step was Berlin that it\u2019s a must in Germany\
  \ ... I  went on summer so the time to practice running it\u2019s excellent .. they\
  \ have beautiful parks. And you can see handsome men .. I made running of 8 kilometers..\
  \ until the famous door ... I wen at 7 am that\u2019s the perfect time to make a\
  \ picture ..  no one will spoil your picture and the morning it\u2019s nice for\
  \ the light ... actually I try to made a picture one night before but it\u2019s\
  \ a little difficult to have one without people. At night the best dinner it\u2019\
  s a sausage .. they are the sousage\u2019s \nKings.. and a beer .. that\u2019s was\
  \ my first trip in German.. but in the winter I could visited again German this\
  \ time to make the Romantic road .. was beautiful.. I began in Berlin again for\
  \ the flight and because I rend a car.. since that moment I could see that something\
  \ was different in German .. the atmisphere was all Christmas.. they love Christmas..\
  \ and me too .. so was the perfec match .. I visited almost 10 Christmas market\
  \ in all the journey ... i know many people think it\u2019s not a good idea visit\
  \ Germany in the winter but ... i think it\u2019s the best .. you can see the castles\
  \ with snow , the towns with Christmas decorations and eat traditional food .. \
  \ gluwien and einspunch with a special person could be the best day of your life\
  \ .. Germany changes in winter .. the mountains the landscape it\u2019s better .\
  \ In the afternoon to take something hot after a long time walking around an American\
  \ coffee with a cake or a hot pretzel . And why not at night take a swim in the\
  \ hot pool. Wake up and see in the window snows it\u2019s a nice peace... \n\nI\
  \ just see another view of Germany ..and I love it"
