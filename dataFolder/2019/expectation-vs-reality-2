Text: "I won\u2019t get scammed. \n\nWe\u2019ve all said it, and we\u2019ve all believed\
  \ it. \n\nHaven\u2019t we all scoffed these words? Haven\u2019t we all backpacked\
  \ with that naive sense of untouchable confidence? I sure have. \n\nThere\u2019\
  s an exotic pull to Morocco that's both alluring and elusive. As backpackers, we\
  \ filter through tourist traps trying to find something genuine and real, and a\
  \ real Moroccan adventure isn\u2019t complete without a trek into The Sahara Desert.\
  \ A paradoxical landscape where we seek connection through isolation. \n\nMy two\
  \ friends and I booked a 2-night trek through our riad in Fes. It began with an\
  \ 8-hour drive, and an hour into our journey our driver realises he\u2019s forgotten\
  \ something; he doesn\u2019t speak English so we assume it\u2019s important. He\
  \ pulls over, leaves us at a closed roadhouse on the highway and makes a gesture\
  \ that suggests he\u2019ll be back. An hour passes and we entertain ourselves, another\
  \ 30-minutes pass and we develop a nervous laugh because our \u2018go with the flow\u2019\
  \ attitude is wavering. But, before hope is lost, he returns and we continue on.\n\
  \nMost tours take you in an air-conditioned car that stops at a few sights along\
  \ the way. Our car was not air-conditioned, and we did not stop - it was the height\
  \ of Moroccan Summer.\n\n12-hours later, we finally get out of the car and are shuffled\
  \ to camels waiting to walk us through the desert. This part of the trek was actually\
  \ a very beautiful experience, one that I won\u2019t get into now in the interest\
  \ of poignancy. \n\nAfter our night in the sand dunes, we moved to a hotel close\
  \ by, it was a modest place that was only half-built, but that\u2019s cool - it\u2019\
  s all part of the experience, right? The second day was ours to explore and we were\
  \ excited to visit the local village with a local guide - we thought it was all\
  \ included - it was not.\n\nWe considered staying in the hotel but were told the\
  \ power wouldn\u2019t be turned on during the day - we only paid to use it at night.\
  \ Frustration began to kick in, so in an attempt to change our mindset we decided\
  \ to pay the extra cost and explore the local area. A taxi was organised for us,\
  \ but he wouldn\u2019t pick us up from the hotel, the hotel manager dropped us to\
  \ him. We arrived in town and were hurried through the local village, and despite\
  \ paying for an all-day taxi had to walk 30-minutes in 45-degree heat to our lunch-spot.\
  \ As it turned out, this was just a souvenir shop where we were given food and coerced\
  \ into buying things. Our frustration began to grow.\n\nFeeling cheated, we abruptly\
  \ left and asked for our taxi to be called. He arrived 30-minutes late and during\
  \ the drive back said he would leave us at a gas station, the hotel manager would\
  \ pick us up soon. He pulled over and waited for us to get out of the car, but we\
  \ had no way to contact the hotel manager because he refused to give us his number.\
  \ We insisted on staying in the car. \n\nUnwilling to move, the taxi driver eventually\
  \ gave in and drove to a house where the hotel manager emerged from. Looking annoyed\
  \ we had rushed him, we jumped into his car and sat quietly on the ride home. Back\
  \ at the hotel, the staff still refused to turn the power on, and our frustration\
  \ reached its absolute height. \n\nLooking back it\u2019s all quite hilarious to\
  \ me now. What I can\u2019t shake is the feeling of being forced into that arrogant\
  \ westerner box. I never thought that would happen to me. I became an obnoxious\
  \ person making exclamations like \u201Cdoes nothing work in this place,\u201D and\
  \ hated myself for it. Everything the locals explain to you comes across innocuous,\
  \ and yet your blood boils. It\u2019s an awful feeling and I\u2019m searching for\
  \ a way to make sure I don\u2019t feel that way again. Now I\u2019m the one who\
  \ warns people against scams and laughs when they scoff back at me, I smile with\
  \ a knowing look and think to myself, I was once like you - good luck."
