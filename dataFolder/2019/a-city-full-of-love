Text: "This isn\u2019t a story about how beautiful a city or country is, nor about\
  \ meeting someone new. This is a piece of a little girl\u2019s experience who just\
  \ got a meaning of life, love, and reason why people always come home. For some\
  \ people, having a romantic relationship is often associated with having a partner.\
  \ That\u2019s exactly what I used to know. Unfortunately, not every relationship\
  \ ended up nicely. Sometimes, it\u2019s not our partner who missed us, not even\
  \ your roommate. At least, that\u2019s the thing that changed my mind when I visited\
  \ Jogjakarta in 2018.\n\n\u201CWake up, we\u2019re about to go to Sanden!\u201D\
  \ said my mother on the second day staying in Jogjakarta. At the moment, the sun\
  \ shone brightly, the wind blew calmly, and the swish of waves rattled on the shore.\
  \ It seemed a bit clich\xE9 like a story in some romantic novels, but it was exactly\
  \ what I felt. Unfortunately, I just had a fight with my ex-boyfriend. I could not\
  \ find comfort or calmness during the trip. But you know what, my father always\
  \ told me, \u201CJust enjoy the trip, you\u2019ll like it sooner or later!\u201D\
  .\n\nArriving in Sanden, the villagers greeted me pleasantly. They served us some\
  \ bakpia and tea in the middle of the conversation. I had no idea who they were,\
  \ but they said that they knew me well. In fact, they could explain what my habits\
  \ were when I was just a child. But, I didn\u2019t really care about it. The only\
  \ thing crossing my mind was just the relationship that ran aground between me and\
  \ the one I thought would accompany me when I grew up. No sooner had I thought about\
  \ him than one of the villager told me that there\u2019s a beach near Sanden. So\
  \ that, I decided to go there.\n\nI saw the waves hit the reef so many times. Gradually,\
  \ the reefs were eroded little by little. At that moment, what I felt were just\
  \ sadness and pain that were suffocating. Like waves and reefs, I was the reef that\
  \ had been eroded thousand times by waves. Maybe what they meant is just kissing\
  \ one and other, but it was clear that the reefs were destroyed by the waves at\
  \ last. And you know what, that\u2019s what I felt when I had a conversation with\
  \ him. But, the rice had become porridge. If the reefs were chest-filled, why couldn\u2019\
  t I?\n\nExperiencing not so good memories is something commonly felt by many people.\
  \ However, interpreting the pain is perceived differently by everyone. Like a reef,\
  \ I interpreted pain as a life experience that made me strong. What sometimes was\
  \ forgotten by me is probably the opportunity to love myself before I finally decided\
  \ to have a relationship with someone else. If I didn\u2019t know myself better,\
  \ how could I make peace with others?\n\nSuddenly, all sweet and bitter memories\
  \ flashed. For some reason, the time felt longer. At the end, the sun began to set.\
  \ I felt the warmth and comfort. I knew well that at last I had to end the relationship\
  \ between me and him. However, I can start a new relationship with someone else,\
  \ like the sun is shining to start the day. I can also carve out my own story, like\
  \ writer is taking a pen to write out the new page of book. If I get tired, I can\
  \ take a rest like a coma paused the story. I can also solve my mistakes, like the\
  \ eraser fixed the word. In the end, I know what the sun will always set and the\
  \ point will always end a story. The point is I just can\u2019t easily give up.\n\
  \nVisiting Jogjakarta made me understand that life was sometimes painful. It\u2019\
  s okay, I\u2019ve also felt the same thing. Just breathe and take a rest. A new\
  \ life is waiting out there. Maybe you have not realized it, but you will. Trip\
  \ to Jogjakarta gave me a very valuable life experience. For my parents, Jogjakarta\
  \ is exactly their home. But for me, Jogjakarta is a place to find love and reason\
  \ to interpret life better. My father is right, just enjoy the trip!"
