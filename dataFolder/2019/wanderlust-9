Text: "There is something to be said about leaping into the unknown for the first\
  \ time. Purposefully falling into places, you never imagined you could go; the exhilaration\
  \ and the fear are all symptoms heightened, chased by euphoria. \nI gripped my cellphone\
  \ in my hand, rushing in to the airport, late friend in tow. Travelling for the\
  \ first time without my family was terrifying, exciting and a major feat in and\
  \ of itself. Years of begging and rationalizing with my parents, I never imagined\
  \ this day would come for me. I am part of a culture that is bigger than my individuality\
  \ \u2013 but narrow-minded enough to suppress desires based on gender \u2013 however,\
  \ my persistence had finally won my parents over. \nWe rushed through security and\
  \ made it to our gate within the last minutes of our flight, \u201CI\u2019m sorry\
  \ ma\u2019am the flight is full, please wait here\u201D.  I could feel the tears\
  \ stinging at my eyes, fighting them back I began to pray fervently and shortly\
  \ thereafter we were told, to my immense relief, that we could board.\n        \
  \                ___ \nI felt new in Miami as if I had left behind the parts of\
  \ me that were afraid, the parts of me that held me back, the parts of me that said,\
  \ \u201Cwho do you think you are\u201D, I could be anyone in Miami, and I was. I\
  \ gave myself a new name and flounced through the city feeling the power of the\
  \ sun that would not display in Ontario for another 4 months!\nI explored the cafes,\
  \ the beaches, and I was impressed, especially floored by the colours of Miami -\
  \ it was like everyplace I visited spoke the language of summer. The restaurants\
  \ were chic, and the food delicious enough to make you come back for more; not to\
  \ mention they were the perfect places for quick Instagram worthy photos!\nMost\
  \ of all, the people of Miami were warm and inviting. During our late night, Pajamas\
  \ only, no makeup ice-cream runs I felt my insecurities fall away from the warmth\
  \ and love of the people of Miami. Everyone was open, everyone kind \u2013 in a\
  \ world where being an islamophobe is in fashion, Miami is giving out free hugs\
  \ and the comfort of it was refreshing!Now more than ever have I realize that I\
  \ will never be content with a sedentary life, I will always have this wondering\
  \ thought of what my next adventure awaits."
