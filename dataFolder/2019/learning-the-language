Text: "It is midway through February before I decide to take my first individual mentoring\
  \ class. I\u2019ve been here several months, but they\u2019ve mainly been spent\
  \ attempting to grasp the language \u2013 its lilts and twists, the local pronunciation,\
  \ the way words tangle in my mouth while I\u2019m speaking until I sound like a\
  \ cat hacking up a hairball of knotted phrases and broken syllables.   \n\nI\u2019\
  m going to be teaching the son of one of my neighbours. I\u2019ve never met him\
  \ before, nor his parents, and I\u2019m reciting Spanish phrases in my head like\
  \ a mantra of good luck as I approach their building. There seems something wrong\
  \ about teaching English here at times, this small rural town where shuttered shops\
  \ sleep every Sunday and where the mist rolls off the sea in the evenings like a\
  \ blanket tucking the town in for the night. Introducing the turbulence of the English-speaking\
  \ world to a secluded town steeped in local tradition feels like I\u2019m unsettling\
  \ a tranquillity that has been decades in the making.  \n\nI introduce myself to\
  \ his mother when she answers the door, keeping my answers short or reserved to\
  \ the occasional nod of my head. I wish I could find the words to express myself,\
  \ but the fear of stumbling over speech and warping the words keeps me silent. I\
  \ find out that our English lesson has displaced one of his scheduled football practices\
  \ and work to conceal my horror. Football is infinitely more exciting to an eight-year-old\
  \ boy than getting to grips with a language he studies twice a week at school. She\
  \ calls him out to greet me, and the hostility is tangible. \n\n\u201CMaybe a walk\
  \ would be a good idea.\u201D She suggests doubtfully, watching as he scuffs the\
  \ toes of his football boots against the door frame, his small hands shoved stubbornly\
  \ into the pockets of his shorts. \n\nShe demands two kisses from her son before\
  \ we leave \u2013 resentfully provided on each cheek \u2013 and we begin a slow\
  \ amble up the small hill that overlooks the coastline. The silence is gloomy, an\
  \ unspoken wedge between us, only interrupted by the rhythmic chiming of church\
  \ bells and the chatter of women wrapped in neat fur coats. \n\nIt seems warm to\
  \ me, far warmer than I\u2019d expect for a February back in Wales, and my bare\
  \ arms set me apart from the people we pass. The heat and the smell of eucalyptus\
  \ make the air heavy, a weight that seems to worsen as every attempt at conversation\
  \ I make is met with a downward glare and a kick at the dust that has settled on\
  \ the pathway we follow. By the time we reach the peak of the hill, and the short\
  \ chapel that crowns it, I feel like I\u2019ve already considered dozens of conversational\
  \ topics and dismissed them all. \n\nI open my mouth \u2013 ready to admit defeat\
  \ \u2013 when a movement to my right makes my breath catch. A lizard, fat and brown,\
  \ has fastened himself to the wall of the chapel and is basking in the sunlight.\
  \ \n\nI stop and stare, wonder washing over me. The only lizards I\u2019ve ever\
  \ seen this close have been behind a wall of glass \u2013 or at least a thick sheet\
  \ of plastic. Every ordinary detail \u2013 its beady eyes, the curl of its tail\
  \ \u2013 is inexplicably fascinating, and I resist the urge to blink, wanting to\
  \ capture every feature. \n\nI\u2019ve briefly forgotten about my silent companion,\
  \ until something grabs at my fingers. \n\n\u201CLagartija.\u201D He points at the\
  \ lizard, smiling, amused. I say it back, slowly, our eyes meeting for a moment.\
  \ \n\u201CLagartija.\u201D \nThe shift between us lifts the weight from my shoulders\
  \ and I smile. \n\u201CLizard,\u201D I say, sticking my tongue out between my teeth\
  \ in a poor imitation of the lizard next to us. His smile widens into a gap-toothed\
  \ grin.\n\u201CLizard.\u201D \n\nThe rest of our walk alternates between a newly\
  \ amiable quiet and the sharing of words, carefully spoken and slowly repeated.\
  \ I remember the excitement that comes with learning, and being able to share a\
  \ small part of the world with someone else, even if it is just a small, sun-bathing\
  \ lizard on a white-wash wall."
