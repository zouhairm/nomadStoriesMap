Text: "Before you can understand, take precaution; this is not like any other place\
  \ you have been, nor is it similar to any dream. Add it to the cup of wonders if\
  \ you will. Understanding this is damn near impossible, because for you to understand\
  \ you will have to leave with me. You must desire to leap with me, embark on the\
  \ unknown tour, this is your tour guide. Take a chance, have faith, feel how right\
  \ it feels to want more of what you\u2019re reading because you haven\u2019t stopped.\
  \ This is about... not being able to stop. Only knowing how to continue even though\
  \ you have no clue what\u2019s about to happen. I\u2019m telling you carefully now,\
  \ imagine imagining sights never before imagined, feelings you haven\u2019t felt\
  \ in so long, but when reminded of- you feel great. Imagine if you could close your\
  \ eyes and continue to read these words. Without any hesitation that\u2019s the\
  \ kind of magic you\u2019ll be wanting more of. You have no idea how to understand\
  \ what you have not been exposed to. I\u2019m I am telling you that I don\u2019\
  t know what I\u2019m doing here, I don\u2019t know what writing means, I don\u2019\
  t know how I know that this is so captivating I haven\u2019t said a thing about\
  \ a thing yet I\u2019ve found a way plenty... more than likely I have made a mess\u2014\
  \ I don\u2019t know. How about me journey to find the answers?"
