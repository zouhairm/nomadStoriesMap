Text: "This happened when we visited Zanzibar for the first time. As a part of exploring\
  \ Zanzibar we visited Kizimkazi a beautiful blue water beach near to a village called\
  \ Fisherman's Village. Beach there looked stunning and picture perfect with little\
  \ waves rushing to the shore, crystal clear blue water and with boats parked, everywhere\
  \ i looked was a absolute scenery.\n\nWe visited there because it was from there\
  \ that we had to take a boat to swim along and watch dolphins. Near the shore there\
  \ were small stalls that rent snorkeling kit. We rented 2 sets and got in the small\
  \ motor boat, which can carry around 6 people, and the boat moved towards the deep\
  \ end of the sea. When i looked down into the see from the moving boat i could see\
  \ the white ocean bed very clearly and it looked stunning. \n\nDuring the ride our\
  \ driver explained us how things are going to be and i panicked. He said sea is\
  \ really deep where we are going and only people who knows good swimming should\
  \ jump. My brother who was there with me knew swimming very well and he has done\
  \ it before. I was worried and i was trying to decide whether i want to do it or\
  \ not. But unfortunately even before I could decide we were there. \n\nThere were\
  \ so many boats at one place and when our boat reached there, i could see the dolphins\
  \ coming up the water and the going down deep and then we follow the dolphins as\
  \ the water was clear. Dolphins were beautiful to watch and this was the first time\
  \ that i was seeing a Dolphin live. I was excited to watch them. \n\nOur boat moved\
  \ together with dolphin and when we reached much closer the driver asked us to jump\
  \ and my brother jumped and it was my turn. i have never done a deep sea dive and\
  \ that was the first time. i was scared to death and i swam only in pools. Everyone\
  \ was shouting at me \"JUMP\" \"JUMP\". I looked at everyone and even though my\
  \ heart said \"YES\" and my mind said \"NO\", I listened to my heart and took my\
  \ leap of faith and jumped in the sea.\nThe moment i went inside the water i got\
  \ panicked and tried to swim vigorously. Water entered inside my mouth through the\
  \ snorkeling kit and entered in my eyes through the glasses which i was wearing,\
  \ and these made it worse. My eyes where burning and i was coughing. i was floating\
  \ up the water and was calling for the boat. Everyone got scared seeing me and boat\
  \ came near me. But just as when i saw the boat coming closer to me i saw myself\
  \ floating perfectly in water.\n\nThe driver and my brother pulled me up and the\
  \ driver scolded me saying something which i didn't understand as i was in a trance\
  \ state trying to understand what just happened. Inside my mind I was happy that\
  \ despite my fear i jumped and defeated my fear."
