Text: "Master Yoda stares down at me, armed with a severed leg in one hand and a chainsaw\
  \ in the other, while Mike Myers tends bar behind the counter. In this little corner\
  \ of Tokyo, where all the drinks cost \xA5666, I sip my beer and take it all in.\n\
  \nBathed in blood-red light and blasting heavy metal music, the bar seats just 8\
  \ people. Although measuring only about 100 square feet, every inch of surface in\
  \ this tiny den is absolutely covered with movie memorabilia and paraphernalia.\
  \ Posters, figures and collectibles, stacks upon stacks of movies\u2014 it\u2019\
  s a riotous amalgam of horror films, obscure and cheesy B movies, and cult classics.\
  \ Posters for Deliverance and Child's Play can be found next to Takashi Miike favourites\
  \ like Audition and Ichi the Killer, mixed in with various metal bands. A Terminator\
  \ figure poses between Pinhead and the Predator. Lined along the counter are VHS\
  \ tapes of movies with fantastically cheesy names like Deathgasm, The Nostril Picker,\
  \ and 2 Everything, 2 Terrible II: Tokyo Drift. An old-school CRT television set\
  \ plays an 80's horror movie I've never heard of. A relatively avid film enthusiast,\
  \ I recognise maybe a quarter of the materials on display. The sheer amount of detail\
  \ is staggering and I can\u2019t begin to imagine the time and effort it took to\
  \ collect it all.\n\nThe bartender, \"Mike Myers,\" is actually the proprietor,\
  \ X, a Japanese man in his mid-40's. A Wayne\u2019s World super-fan, every subsequent\
  \ visit has seen him sporting the same ensemble: black T-shirt, Garth's plastic\
  \ frame glasses, and messy, shoulder length black hair topped with the title character\u2019\
  s signature \"Wayne\u2019s World\" baseball cap.\n\nDespite the exaggerated attire,\
  \ however, over several visits I've found X to be surprisingly quiet and soft-spoken.\
  \ Discussing our mutual love of movies, he casually mentions that the prolific Japanese\
  \ cult director Sion Sono is a regular at the bar, and I'm not surprised. As the\
  \ director of Tokyo Tribe, likely the world's only Yakuza-rap-musical-comedy film,\
  \ I can see him feeling right at home here. \n\nLooking beyond the silly movie titles\
  \ and aggressive music, an unexpected depth of passion becomes evident. The bar\
  \ is an all out paean to X's two loves: film and heavy metal. And the dedication\
  \ that went into it is reflective of the quality and excellence that is expected\
  \ in Japan. Quality abounds everywhere. It's a place where ramen shops win Michelin\
  \ stars, pre-made convenience store food actually tastes good, and the food processing\
  \ and hygiene is so meticulous as to make something like raw chicken sashimi not\
  \ only possible, but popular (with locals anyway!).\n\nPride is taken in providing\
  \ the best possible experience. Tokyo's massive train system runs with world-class\
  \ precision. You can see blocks of ice shaved by hand right before your eyes for\
  \ your glass of whisky, and watch cream get freshly whipped to order to top your\
  \ slice of key lime pie. From luxury department stores in Ginza to humble used bookstores\
  \ in Jimbocho, you can encounter staff that are not only attentive but uncommonly\
  \ knowledgable. The bar's owner, X, seems to have a near encyclopaedic knowledge\
  \ of horror films and metal bands, making annual pilgrimages to various Scandinavian\
  \ heavy metal festivals. The bar exists because of this passion and his desire to\
  \ share it.\n\nThe track changes and a different song comes on, bringing me back\
  \ to surreality. I look around. Customers are talking to one another, discussing\
  \ their shared appreciation for this band, that song, or the unconventional cinematic\
  \ library crammed in together with us. The space transports you to its own little\
  \ world, encouraging intimacy and the making of new friends. \n\nX tells me that\
  \ he tends the bar himself each night before taking the next morning's first train\
  \ back home, and I can\u2019t help wondering what this home looks like. Is it like\
  \ the bar? Is it another canvas for his passion? \n\nThe night ends with a simple\
  \ act of kindness. As I prepare to leave, X asks if I have an umbrella. \u201CIt\u2019\
  s started raining,\u201D he remarks and, over my protests, hands me an umbrella.\
  \ I step out into the night, back into the real world, feeling oddly content."
