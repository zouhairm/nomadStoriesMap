Text: "Astonished!!!! Yeah really I would like to start the journey with these. The\
  \ pleasant climate started my day with some loaded energy in me. As I was new to\
  \ the city and unknown to the language the very first thing in my mind was to communicate\
  \ but atlast English helped me a lot . \nAs being lucky to born in a South Indian\
  \ family helped me to communicate in broken language there. First when I started\
  \ my day it was nearly some 6.30 in the morning I went to some local lake (agara)\
  \ the chirping of birds and blomming of flowers gave me some good vibes.\nLater\
  \ it was not the same picture as that , the traffic started whole around the city\
  \ as I came to know that during the peak hours this traffics are common for the\
  \ local commuters there.\nSo these was the scenario till around 11am.\nAfter completing\
  \ my brunch I started to travel in a local bus i.e bmtc so I took the bus till banashankari\
  \ metro as my destiny was Lalbagh botanical park , i need to take metro for the\
  \ short route and reach early there.\nAfter reaching to Lalbagh there were many\
  \ species of different plants it was more than some 50 . \nAs my day was very less\
  \ in Bangalore so I would like end here"
