Text: "I didn't expect to find fun while traveling for business.  I expected a boring\
  \ flight, a boring hotel room, and a totally boring experience.  In and out. No\
  \ fun. Nothing interesting.  But then I decided that when I travel for business,\
  \ I will arrange extra time to do something fun and/or exciting. While in San Antonio,\
  \ Texas, I found it all.  There for business purposes that would take about four\
  \ hours of my time, I set an intention to find something I actually WANTED to do.\
  \  I love caves and I love ziplining.  So, before leaving for the trip, I scheduled\
  \ in some \"down time.\" \n\nI decided to go ahead and schedule a ziplining experience.\
  \  I searched online and found a zipline near the city. I actually scheduled it\
  \ and paid for it so that I would not get to my destination and decide I was too\
  \ tired or did not have sufficient time to go ziplining. By paying ahead of time,\
  \ I locked myself into an experience I would love, and I would not miss it.  I had\
  \ paid for it, so I would do it.  \n\nI also found a cave tour and experience and\
  \ paid for that.  Spending my hard-earned dollars guaranteed that I would not find\
  \ an excuse to miss this unique cave experience. By setting the intentions, planning,\
  \ and paying, I worked my business schedule in such a way to benefit personally\
  \ from these one-of-a-kind tours. \n\nMy eyes opened, I planned necessary meals\
  \ around finding exotic new foods and trying the offerings at a local brewery. And\
  \ a local winery. Boring business meals became new adventures, courtesy of a \"\
  boring\" location.\n\nI decided and determined that business travel does NOT have\
  \ to be boring; it does NOT have to be ALL business. This opened my eyes to looking\
  \ around in \"boring\" locations and finding fun, exciting things to do.  After\
  \ this experience, fun business travel has become my habit. It just takes a little\
  \ planning, looking beyond the obvious, and rewarding myself for all my hard work.\
  \ I will never travel the same way again."
