Text: "Gazing out the window as the plane was circling the city, I could see hints\
  \ of sparkling lights amongst the dark background. I looked in awe at the lights\
  \ twinkling in the distance. I turned to my sister. \u201CIt doesn\u2019t look like\
  \ a village anymore,\u201D I commented. It was one in the morning and our plane\
  \ was finally about to land after a long journey from Toronto, Canada.\n\n\u201C\
  Do you think we\u2019ll be able to make it in time for the ser \xFB p\xEA?\u201D\
  \ The man behind us asked his friend sitting beside him. \u201CIf there are no delays,\
  \ we\u2019ll make it in time by 4.\u201D His friend reassured him; calculating the\
  \ three-hour drive to their hometown to eat the traditional food that their tongues\
  \ had been deprived of and salivating for since last leaving this foreign land.\
  \ The excitement felt by these two men echoed throughout the aircraft. The plane\
  \ had not yet hit the asphalt, however, the eager and impatient passengers unbuckled\
  \ their seatbelts and began taking their luggage out of the overhead compartments.\
  \ The tires of the plane finally hit solid ground, and the passengers on board erupted\
  \ into a round of applause.\n\nAs we left the aircraft, the smell of petroleum gently\
  \ caressed my nostrils, a subtle reminder that this foreign land was rich in oil.\
  \ We grabbed our luggage from baggage claim and walked towards the long line of\
  \ people waiting to enter the region. Hanging from the ceiling was a flag, red,\
  \ white and green, with a twenty-one-ray sun shining in the middle. It served as\
  \ another reminder that this land was not the same as the country down south. A\
  \ rush of adrenaline hit me as the immigration officer stamped our passports, smiling\
  \ coyly. \u201CWelcome home.\u201D\n\nHome. I was home, the land of my parents and\
  \ grandparents. A land that felt so real, yet so mythical all at once. A land that\
  \ doesn\u2019t have defined borders and can\u2019t be found on a map. A land that\
  \ had stirred my imagination since childhood: Kurdistan. A region that straddles\
  \ four countries: Iran, Iraq, Turkey, and Syria. Kurdistan: a word that drips off\
  \ the tongue as sweetly as honey. Kurdistan: the land of the Medes, the land of\
  \ my ancestors.\n\nBorn and raised in Canada, my family and I were considered part\
  \ of the Kurdish diaspora. My father was a Peshmerga fighter in the 1970s and 80s,\
  \ fighting against Saddam Hussein\u2019s dictatorship in Iraq. My mother was born\
  \ and raised in Erbil, the capital city of the Kurdistan Region of Iraq, and the\
  \ oldest continuously inhabited city in the world. My parents, although Iraqi on\
  \ paper and by citizenship, identified as Kurds from an imaginary country called\
  \ Kurdistan. That was their home.\n\nAs I grew older, my curiosity for Kurdistan\
  \ deepened. And here I was, my feet leaving the Erbil International Airport to a\
  \ bus that would transport us to the arrival area, where all of my relatives were\
  \ waiting impatiently for our arrival. \u201CI see them!\u201D my mom exclaimed\
  \ as she waved from the bus window. My siblings and I were standing at the gateway\
  \ to this new world that would be our home for the next two months. The bus finally\
  \ came to a stop, and the doors opened. Kurdish women wearing colourful dresses\
  \ that sparkled in the night sky threw chocolates, candies, and confetti into the\
  \ air. The women let out high-pitched vocals of ululation in celebration of the\
  \ arrival of loved ones from overseas.\n\nMen grabbed suitcases at random from the\
  \ bus. We were caught in the intensity of the moment, kissed and hugged by random\
  \ strangers as we tried to navigate our way through the chaos to find a familiar\
  \ face. \u201CDo you remember us?\u201D asked an old Kurdish woman hugging my brother\
  \ as tears dotted her face. No, she wasn\u2019t a relative, just a woman that was\
  \ happy to see young Kurds from the diaspora come back home. From that moment on,\
  \ I knew that the rest of the summer would be one of amazement and wonder. Overcome\
  \ with deep emotion by the warmth and friendliness within the first couple of hours,\
  \ I thought to myself: Welcome to Kurdistan. Welcome home."
