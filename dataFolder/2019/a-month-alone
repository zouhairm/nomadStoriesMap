Text: "Since I was a child I had a dream. A dream of going into the United Kingdom.\
  \ Sure, you could call me an Anglophile. I knew the map of England better than I\
  \ knew the back of my hand.\nWhen I finally stepped off of that Icelandic plane\
  \ and into Gatwick, it hit me like a brick that dream had finally come true- and\
  \ I was experiencing it alone.\nWhen I reached London, I felt so elated- tired but\
  \ so elated. The first thing I did was get a cup of coffee, and to my surprise there\
  \ was no drip coffee. I was totally fine though- I got my Americano, and with my\
  \ backpack strapped on my back, I left Victoria station- filled with glee!\nI went\
  \ and saw a few of the sights- Buckingham Palace being the closest thing to me.\
  \ I snapped a few photos, and went to find Hyde Park. My hostel was on the edge\
  \ of the park, so that would make it easy to find- well, easy enough if I was on\
  \ the right side of the park! As someone who is directionally challenged, I\u2019\
  m not surprised that I was not at the right side of the park. It was not a bad mistake\
  \ though- I found one of my favorite places in London during that trek to my hostel.\
  \ I was in London. I was in London and I had never been happier in my life!"
