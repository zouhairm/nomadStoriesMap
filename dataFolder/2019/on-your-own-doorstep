Text: "Isn\u2019t it funny how people go all over the world searching for that \u201C\
  something unique, unspoilt and original\u201D and actually, sometimes what\u2019\
  s on your own doorstep can be the most surprising and beautiful place?\nWhen I say\
  \ \u201Cyour own doorstep\u201D, I am referring more specifically to the island\
  \ of Sark. This tiny island, one of the Channel Islands, is charmingly referred\
  \ to by Wikipedia as \u201Cone of the few remaining places in the world where cars\
  \ are banned and only tractors and horse-drawn vehicles are allowed.\u201D And located\
  \ just over 200 miles away from my home in London, it feels like an absolute alternative\
  \ universe. A place where time has stopped and you are just taken back to a period\
  \ of simplicity and sheer, unspoiled and unadulterated beauty. \nMy visit to the\
  \ island of Sark was something of a chance encounter; my partner had won some free\
  \ flights and on a whim, we decided to check out the island of Guernsey. Whilst\
  \ there, the owner of our hotel recommended a day trip to Sark.\nNow, this will\
  \ sound cliched but the day we visited to Sark was one of those picture perfect,\
  \ classic British summertime kind of days. It was early May and there wasn\u2019\
  t a cloud in the sky and the temperature was unseasonably warm. And as anyone has\
  \ visited Britain will know, when the sun comes out to play, the friendliness of\
  \ us Brits goes through the roof. We talk to people in the shops, we smile at people\
  \ on public transport - even in London. \nNow, take that British cheer for sunshine\
  \ and add some Channel Islands general good spirit and welcoming vibe in there.\
  \ It was just the most perfect day. \nAs soon as we arrived at Sark, I knew this\
  \ was going to be a special experience. We disembarked from the ferry and were bundled\
  \ onto the shuttle between the port and the main centre of Sark. Now, remember what\
  \ Wikipedia said about there being no cars? Well, the shuttle was a tractor with\
  \ a trailer on the back. The twenty or so of us who had decided to visit Sark for\
  \ the day looked amusingly at one another as we bumped along the road, up the hill,\
  \ to the main square.\nUpon our arrival we hired bikes, got a map and decided to\
  \ spend a few hours exploring. My breath was taken away by what I saw. \nWild flowers\
  \ grew alongside the dust tracks that constituted the \u201Croads\u201D on Sark.\
  \ Tractors overtook us from time to time, the drivers happily going about their\
  \ daily business, seemingly oblivious to the fact that their main daily method of\
  \ transport would be considered unique or even bizarre by many. The sea sparkled\
  \ under the sun, its clarity and colour rivalling that I\u2019d seen in many more\
  \ \u201Cexotic\u201D places. (Seriously, the sea there could give Mauritus a run\
  \ for its money). And everyone was so friendly and welcoming. There was no sense\
  \ of us being \u201Coutsiders\u201D who were unwelcome. People were happy that we\
  \ were visiting and were proud of their glorious little corner of the Earth.\nLater\
  \ that afternoon we popped into a pub to grab a bite to eat and a drink following\
  \ on from our pootle around the island. The Grand National was on the television\
  \ in the corner of the pub and a group of locals were jostling around the screen.\
  \ This reminded me of home, and that no matter where you are in the world, there\
  \ will always be sport, people getting agitated by the result, and having a drink\
  \ or two along with it. \nAs we set sail for our return to Guernsey, using (of course)\
  \ our shuttle tractor service to get back to the ferry, I reflected on what a glorious\
  \ experience it had been. Two friends of mine had recently been to Machu Picchu\
  \ and waxed lyrical about how magnificent it was. Yet I reflected at how lucky I\
  \ had been. To not have to travel for hours on end to find something so unique,\
  \ special and so surprising. What a wonderful place."
