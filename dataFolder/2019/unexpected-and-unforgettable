Text: "Covering ourselves with warm coats and still shivering in the middle of summer\
  \ from the fresh and strong wind, we were going down the waterfront promenade trying\
  \ to get to the end of the world (Bout du Monde, like the people call it in Le Havre)\
  \ just to enjoy the rocks and the endless beauty of the sea, that is not the beauty\
  \ of its southern brothers and sisters \u2013 it\u2019s strict and severe, like\
  \ the beauty of all those northern lands where people always had to work hard for\
  \ their living, but who have generous and loving hearts. By \u201Cwe\u201D I mean\
  \ Samy, a Togolese, with quite a unique sense of humor, Lara, whose parents were\
  \ from \u201Cthe islands\u201D as French call them, Ben, the only \u201Ctrue\u201D\
  \ French out of all of us, John, who, born of the British parents, looked and behaved\
  \ in a very \u201CBritish\u201D way even though he grew up in France, and me, the\
  \ Russian one. But here we were, together, united by those strong ties of friendship\
  \ that would overcome distances and differences. No politics, no war. \nEven though\
  \ I love discovering new places, it was not exactly the destination I dreamed of.\
  \ It was John who insisted. And so passionate he was about the city he grew up in\
  \ that I couldn\u2019t but accept the invitation. But so grey and gloomy was the\
  \ day when we first saw it, and so grey and gloomy seemed the concrete of the city\
  \ center once reimagined and realized by August Perret, that I couldn\u2019t resist\
  \ thinking about the devastation the war once brought to the region. And even though\
  \ it is now rebuilt and calmly graceful, it still has this touch of grief, like\
  \ when you meet a person who suffered a great loss and you can still see it hiding\
  \ deep in his eyes. \nI live in a country that suffered a lot during WWII. I know\
  \ what it\u2019s like to still have the echoes of it within most of the families\
  \ even though so many years have passed. The memory of the war and the understanding\
  \ that the world still suffers, helps you treasure your peaceful life, and those\
  \ moments of just sitting side by side with people who are so different but who\
  \ are your true friends, joking around and wiping up sticky fingers after trying\
  \ those famous-here-also-chouquettes. It\u2019s like embracing the world and making\
  \ it more human. \nAnd still I loved the city. It had its own charm. The joy is\
  \ brought to it by the endless play of the cranes and bright colored containers\
  \ being loaded and unloaded. I never thought it would be that fascinating. We would\
  \ take a boat only to see how it looks like from the sea. And John would not be\
  \ tired to tell us everything he knew about this place even though at the moment\
  \ he had already moved away from there. His love spread to a point where he\u2019\
  d follow on-line streaming of the cruise ships arrivals and departures from the\
  \ port. We would listen to him describing the former glory of Queen Mary 2 and picture\
  \ ourselves standing among all those people on the wharf wishing safe journey to\
  \ those going over the Atlantic. Even though now the ships come and go pretty often\
  \ but still there is no comparison to what it once was.\nAnd then John would say\
  \ \u201CYou know, Le Havre has two cities: the upper one and the lower one\u2026\
  \u201D and we would all follow up in chorus: \u201Cthat\u2019s why there are so\
  \ many stairs\u201D \u2013 so many times he had told us about it that we learnt\
  \ it by heart. And we would climb up and down those endless stairs to discover the\
  \ other parts of the city, not destroyed by the war and reminding us about the rich\
  \ historical heritage of the region. \nAnd finally we would drive to the famous\
  \ Normandy Bridge to see the estuary of the Seine and feel this pulse of the river,\
  \ being like the pulse of the France itself\u2026\nIt was not the kind of tourist\
  \ experience I would expect. And that what I made it unforgettable."
