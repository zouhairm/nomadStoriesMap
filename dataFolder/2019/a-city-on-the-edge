Text: "La Paz is not a city where breathing comes easily. At 11,975 feet above sea\
  \ level, the air is thin and dry, catching like cold splinters in the back of your\
  \ throat. Because of this, the city\u2019s wealth is mapped by altitude: rich residents\
  \ live at the lowest depths of the valley, and as you travel up its sides, the people\
  \ get poorer. The air gets thinner, and thinner still. Eventually you reach El Alto,\
  \ an altiplano town where the poorest people live. But the alte\xF1os have their\
  \ own power, also born from the city\u2019s strange geography: all roads from La\
  \ Paz lead through El Alto. In times of conflict, the alte\xF1os block the roads,\
  \ effectively taking La Paz hostage. La Paz is said to be the highest city in the\
  \ world, but El Alto peers down at it. \n\nOne Wednesday I caught the telef\xE9\
  rico, or cable car, to El Alto\u2019s weekly market. Four people sat in the carriage,\
  \ and we had to distribute our weight evenly, one at each end of the two benches.\
  \ A guard stuck her head in to check on us, and then the glass bubble ticked along\
  \ its tracks and sailed up into the air. Looking down, I saw tiny figures on the\
  \ rooftops of their houses, hanging washing and reading the paper. We floated silently\
  \ on a wire above them. \n\nThen we arrived: El Alto, the heights. Disembarking,\
  \ I found my perspective had shifted - El Alto was no longer a distant point on\
  \ the city\u2019s horizon, but a city itself, the flat plains stretching to a sudden\
  \ edge. La Paz squatted in the valley below us, and there was nothing above us except\
  \ the deep blue bowl of an Andean sky. I followed the other passengers out of the\
  \ telef\xE9rico station and through the dusty streets. The city was gray and brown,\
  \ crumbling buildings whorled with the flaking remnants of old posters. \n\nThen\
  \ the market itself, an explosion of colour and activity. Suddenly the streets were\
  \ choked with it. Sellers spread their wares out under bright plastic sunshades\
  \ - some on tables, some on the ground. These makeshift stalls sprawled out as far\
  \ as the eye could see, a maze of home goods, used car parts, toys, luggage, shoes,\
  \ toiletries and anything else you could think of. I had wondered how I\u2019d know\
  \ the way to the market from the telef\xE9rico station, but like El Alto itself,\
  \ it arrived straight in front of me and seemed to announce itself: here, here,\
  \ here. \n\nAlthough the market bustled with energy, it also offered the peace of\
  \ anonymity: no one even glanced at me as I walked. I stopped at stalls with small\
  \ mountains of clothes piled across the tables, and women rummaging through them.\
  \ Like the market itself, the rummaging was polite, reserved. I pulled a garment\
  \ out of the pile to find the other end held by a young woman. \u201C\xBFLo quiere?\u201D\
  \ I asked. She shook her head and stepped back, smiling, letting me have it. \n\n\
  Hours spent wandering, rubbing fabric between my fingers, yielded a few treasures.\
  \ A striped cotton dress. A pair of brown leather ankle boots. A gray merino sweater,\
  \ made in Italy. Its delicacy seemed incongruous, up there under the harsh Andean\
  \ sun, but so much of El Alto itself was like that. A giant market where commerce\
  \ seemed unimportant. A city of the poor looking down on the rich. All roads from\
  \ La Paz lead through El Alto, but the alte\xF1os have their own roads, leading\
  \ outwards across the altiplano. \n\nShadows were stretching longer on the dusty\
  \ plains, and my cheeks were beginning to burn with the cold air. It was time to\
  \ leave the strange city on the edge of the mountaintop. I boarded the telef\xE9\
  rico again, my purchases in a bag by my feet. We swayed gently on the wire, the\
  \ city below us darkening to an indigo dusk. Behind me, El Alto receded, becoming\
  \ once more a spot on the edge of the horizon, a spot in the minds of the pace\xF1\
  as, the place they thought of when they glanced upwards. And as we traveled downwards,\
  \ that other city came rushing up to meet us."
