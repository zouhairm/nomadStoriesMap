Text: "Dad took his first brave step when I said I wanted to move to England for a\
  \ new adventure. Nearly sounding like he was on autopilot, he said \u201CI\u2019\
  m moving you in\u201D, which came as a surprise. He was finally letting his deep\
  \ desire to know the world echo outside of his mind, free from the shackles of his\
  \ personal misgivings, setbacks, and a larger system we haven\u2019t fully grasped\
  \ stirring up boundaries to effectively deny him the opportunity to fulfill that\
  \ desire. \n\nA silent and sensitive soul by nature, dad\u2019s always carried with\
  \ him a curiosity that\u2019s been met with contempt. The people around him have\
  \ thrown around words like \u201Cnaivety\u201D or \u201Cfoolishness\u201D to mask\
  \ a discomfort with his natural inability to fit into standard definitions of manhood.\
  \ I was one of those people \u2013  uncomfortable with his transparent displays\
  \ of love, his sensitivities to criticism, or the tears he released at every Bollywood\
  \ scene showing a daughter being married off to a new home.  I wished he was stronger,\
  \ bolder, more of a shield for the three women in our household.\n\nWith maturity\
  \ came my inklings that his sensitivity was his greatest gift, but it was only on\
  \ our trip that I understood that the powerful tools of empathy, sensitivity, and\
  \ love that I had deployed to keep me sane over the years were borne of his roots.\
  \ That we were so deeply connected on our ability to feel the air around us, to\
  \ have fondness in greeting new faces, and to embrace adventures with a kindred\
  \ passion. \n\nWhen we travelled through London and Paris, I watched him marvel\
  \ at new streets with gratitude. He made profoundly refreshing observations through\
  \ that childlike innocence that showed me his true gravity.  I saw the melancholy\
  \ and hollowness he often fights through with the routine he\u2019s settled into\
  \ at home disappear with the new sights. The optimism he always carried for the\
  \ world he was once restricted from fully seeing was finally confirmed for him.\
  \ In the happiness of finally touching pavements he never thought he could, he\u2019\
  d temporarily won the war on the lifelong burden of being in spaces where you\u2019\
  re never told that you are enough. \n\nAs someone fiercely protective of his expression,\
  \ his spoken observations sparked by the shock of new spaces finally liberated him.\
  \ Free from a routine that had subjugated him, I watched him blow away the dust\
  \ on the tools of his unique expression to describe to me how he felt seeing the\
  \ alien beauties of nature, concrete, buildings, and banter.\n\nHe felt the energy\
  \ come alive in me, too. He\u2019s seen the impact that toxicity has had on me in\
  \ the past \u2013 we both parallel our negative responses to environments too hostile\
  \ for our souls, not nurturing for the prettier parts of our human spirit that we\
  \ cultivate in hiding and in fear. Seeing me happy and rested in a new place helped\
  \ mend him vicariously. Together, we shared a flow of hope that being in new places\
  \ with new people held promise for being lifted out of a grayness we both see in\
  \ each other but are often too afraid to \u201Cmake a thing of\u201D. \n\nOn a train\
  \ back to the airport, we were talking about the next decade. He told me I\u2019\
  m a bird \u201Cwith no fixed nest\u201D. That my flightiness was something ingrained\
  \ in our genetics. That it served as a potion for rejuvenation, for solace, for\
  \ betterness. His empathy for my nature is born through an understanding of his\
  \ own. The faith he has in me keeps me afloat when I am sometimes wrought by fear\
  \ in my unfamiliar environment. \n\nAt the end of the trip, he pulled out his fitness\
  \ tracker to see that we\u2019d walked 100,000 memorable steps together, not counting\
  \ the first one he took when he leaped in with me. The tracks will stay on my soul\
  \ forever."
