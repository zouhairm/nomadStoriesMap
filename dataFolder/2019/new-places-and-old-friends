Text: 'Me and my partner had hired a car and driven from Frankfurt Germany to saint
  tropez in a period of 4 days and along the way we sore on Facebook one of our close
  friends who we knew worked on massive ships for the rich and famous was somewhere
  In Italy . We could get in contact with him

  Due to his reception so we just drove on and forgot about it. We stopped for some
  lunch and a quite unknown port just before saint tropez and as we were leaving we
  sore a man jogging . I turned to my partner and said that''s Marcus I swear . We
  followed hi

  For a bit and actually ended up pulling him over and it was him . Mind blown he
  gave us a tour of the incredible ship he was a crew hand on. It''s started with
  signing waiver forms and the tour of the most luxury place I''ve ever been started
  . There was rooms upon rooms that seemed to be filled with crystal and gold . The
  dhipeven had enough room to fit two huge jet boats and jets skis underneath along
  with a gym and movie entertainment centre. Marcus went on to tell us the ship was
  only ever occupied by people who didn''t work on it like 1 mo th out of the whole
  year . It was amazing experience and funny to think we could''ve been any where
  in Europe but my mate from my home town happened to run past me in a small fishing
  village.'
