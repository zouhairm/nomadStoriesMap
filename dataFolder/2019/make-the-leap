Text: "2015 - my final year as a business undergrad. Ever since I could remember I\u2019\
  ve wanted to study business. My dad was a business-man and even though I didn\u2019\
  t want to be exactly like him. I could appreciate the \u201Cdream to reality\u201D\
  \ experience you get when you start your own venture. The question was, \u201CWhat\
  \ business? What venture?\u201D. I didn\u2019t know what I\u2019d be doing next\
  \ year. I was hoping I\u2019d land a safe corporate job within the year and make\
  \ the migration from South Africa to Australia worth it for my parents. This was\
  \ our \u201Cland of opportunity\u201D. I knew in my heart I was just doing it to\
  \ make people happy, but hey, at least the monkey would be off my back. No more\
  \ of those \u201CSo what are you gonna do?\u201D or \u201CWho are you gonna be?\u201D\
  \ types of questions. \n\nThat night I was going through my student emails hoping\
  \ that I hadn\u2019t failed the last paper I submitted then BOOM. The subject line\
  \ reads \u201CDisney International Programs\u201D. The email was about doing a cultural\
  \ exchange where I\u2019d be working and living at Disneyworld for 6 months. I won\u2019\
  t lie, initially, I didn\u2019t think it was real. Live and work at Disneyworld?\
  \ 10 minutes into the application process I realised it was. How? The application\
  \ asked me \u201CWhat racial group do you identify as?\u201D. See in Australia,\
  \ it\u2019s illegal for employers to ask that kind of information in an application\
  \ process to minimise discrimination. I thought to myself, \u201Cthis is either\
  \ highly illegal or highly American\u201D. The latter was true and soon I\u2019\
  d be living stateside.\n\n\nMy first day in Orlando was an experience in itself.\
  \ It became very apparent to me that people thought I was American. Even though\
  \ I was black, with an Australian accent. I guess there hasn\u2019t been many African\
  \ Australians living in Orlando the past decade? \nI developed a \u2018work voice\u2019\
  \ after a few weeks; it became easier to fake an American accent than to convince\
  \ people you\u2019re Australian and explain your background. Apparently, this was\
  \ a common thing for my Aussie and Kiwi buddies. That was interesting, but let\u2019\
  s talk Disney.\n\nFull of purpose, people and direction, the highlights ranged from\
  \ road tripping to New Orleans with my roommates. Seeing Gator\u2019s College basketball\
  \ game. Going to all theme parks in one day (yes exhausting). Seeing your friends\
  \ in character. Eating as much Disney themed ice cream as possible. Working 13 hour\
  \ split shifts at 2 different locations so I could pay to see my uncle in D.C. \_\
  Or just asking for a discount on everything in the city because why live at Disney\
  \ and not take full advantage of the opportunity? When I wasn\u2019t getting free\
  \ entry to the parks and discounts on everything in the city as a Disney Employee.\
  \ I worked at two of their Hotel resorts. With co-workers from Spain, China, Japan\
  \ and Brazil, our manager would call us \u201CThe United Nations\u201D when we were\
  \ on shift together. The best way to explain everyday life there? Just a bunch of\
  \ young kids, from all over with different stories and so much in common. Just trying\
  \ to figure out where we fit in this world and what makes us happy. \n\n\n\nThe\
  \ purpose part came in the form of life groups within our dorms. It was this thing\
  \ we did where we\u2019d meet up, once or twice a week in someone\u2019s apartment\
  \ and discuss topics like our daily lives, upbringing, God and religion. It was\
  \ in these apartments conversing with these strangers that quickly became friends\
  \ I realised the natural gifting I had to inspire people via spoken word and writing.\
  \ It was like, I came to America to just experience the country, but I left with\
  \ so much more. \_In those 6 months, I went from not really knowing who I am and\
  \ what I\u2019m capable of, to having a clear vision of who I am and making friends\
  \ all over the world.\nNow I\u2019m back in Australia writing this thinking, \u201C\
  Imagine if I never clicked that email?\u201D \_To make a long story short, life\
  \ is crazy, make the leap."
