Text: "Eddie and I went to see a huge temple just outside Madurai, near the southern\
  \ tip of India. It was a beautiful day, so despite the distance we decided to walk\
  \ back to our hotel in town rather than take a rickshaw. \n\nAfter maybe an hour\
  \ of walking, we found ourselves in a coconut grove. All we could see in any direction\
  \ were towering palm trees. Spots of sunlight peeped through a  sky of green, propped\
  \ up by rough brown stilts. As we kept walking, we started to hear these thwocking\
  \ noises. Thwock thwock thwock\u2026. thwock thwock thwock\u2026 thwock thwock thwock.\
  \ \n\nWe followed the sounds until we came to a low wooden building with a fiber\
  \ roof of some sort (maybe parts of palm trees). A filthy old Royal Enfield was\
  \ propped up nearby, and a few token pieces of laundry gently drifted in the breeze.\
  \ We called out to see if anyone was around, and slowly made our way back through\
  \ the palm trees toward the strange drumming. \n\nAs we rounded a corner, we were\
  \ confronted with the sight of dozens of huge mounds of coconuts, coconut husks,\
  \ and de-husked coconuts. Three men were standing in lunghis, shirtless but for\
  \ a sheen of sweat. Each man had a deadly looking metal spike in front of him, and\
  \ was busy impaling coconuts in order to get the husks off. \n\nThwock thwock thwock!\
  \ \n\n\u201CHey!\u201D \n\nThe man who said it looked baffled but not unfriendly.\
  \ What were a couple of goras (white people) doing walking around here? \n\nHe was\
  \ the fourth man of the group, wearing a black tank top with a snarling tiger on\
  \ it, and loose pants. His English was scant, and our knowledge of the local language\
  \ was nil, so we communicated as best we could. Gestures were helpful. \n\nWe covered\
  \ the basics - who we were, where we were from, how we came to be wandering around\
  \ their slice of paradise. After a few minutes, their suspicion dissipated, and\
  \ everyone was at ease. The men husking coconuts had paused to listen to the conversation.\
  \ Eddie asked (through pointing at himself, the piles, and the spike, and attempting\
  \ to imitate their motions) if they\u2019d let him try one. The oldest man grinned\
  \ and beckoned him over. He picked up a coconut from one of the piles around him,\
  \ and demonstrated the thwocking method. \n\nThree quick stabs. Here, here, and\
  \ here, see? Thwock thwock thwhock! The husk slipped off the nut, and he chucked\
  \ the husk onto a mound of other husks and set the remaining pale green fruit on\
  \ a mountain of young coconuts nearby. He snagged another stringy brown cannonball\
  \ of a coconut, and handed it up to Eddie. His head waggled side to side, and his\
  \ Biblical eyebrows raised as if to ask if Eddie understood what to do. Eddie nodded\
  \ uncertainly and took the coconut.\n\nHe positioned himself as the gentleman had\
  \ - feet about shoulder width apart, knees slightly bent. Relaxed (or trying to\
  \ be relaxed). He raised the coconut up over his head and swung it down. Thunk.\
  \ The coconut was on the spike alright, but Eddie couldn\u2019t seem to get it off.\
  \ The man huffed and hip checked Eddie out of the way, shaking his head the whole\
  \ time. He pulled the nut off the spike and pointed at it, showing Eddie what he\
  \ did wrong. He then proceeded to lance it twice more, and threw the husk and nut\
  \ in their respective piles.\n\nI was too nervous about tripping near the spikes\
  \ to try my own turn at the nut cracking, but it was fun to watch. After that, we\
  \ all shook hands and assured each other that it was a pleasant interlude. Eddie\
  \ and I departed, and made it back into town just in time to watch the sun set on\
  \ our way to dinner."
