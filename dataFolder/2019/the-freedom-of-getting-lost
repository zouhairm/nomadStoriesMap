Text: "We were lost. \n\nSitting in a boat in the middle of the Atlantic, I listened\
  \ to the captain of our boat yell across the water to his comrade\u2014the captain\
  \ of the second vessel taking the twenty-six of us from mainland Belize to South\
  \ Water Caye, a 3.5-acre island off the coast near Dangriga. \n\nWe couldn\u2019\
  t understand them, not even the woman who boasted a clear understanding of Louisiana\
  \ Creole from her time in New Orleans. Though the national language of Belize is\
  \ English, the country\u2019s residents speak an amalgam of Spanish, English, Mandarin,\
  \ Maya, and Garifuna that manifests itself as a diverse language all its own called\
  \ Kriol\u2014a language influenced largely by English and some African dialects\
  \ in its origin. In actuality, Kriol is the first language of the majority of the\
  \ country\u2019s residents, not English. To the untrained ear, the words sound familiar,\
  \ yet put together in the lively, brisk way of native-speakers, an entire exchange\
  \ between two people can sound like a code-language whose translation seems just\
  \ out of reach.\n\nThe frantic gestures and forceful inflections of our two captains\
  \ told us what we couldn\u2019t decipher in their words: we were lost. Lost in the\
  \ middle of the ocean. Lost in the dark. \n\nThe captain of our boat waved left.\
  \ The other captain pointed right. The argument continued.\n\nWhen I heard we would\
  \ be traveling by boat across the ocean, I had pictured a large, sturdy vessel capable\
  \ of transporting all twenty-six of us with ease. What we were currently sitting\
  \ in remind me of two over-sized canoes, both rigged with loud, grumbling outboard\
  \ motors. The sun had set as we boarded the boats at the dock in Dangriga thirty\
  \ minutes prior. We could no longer see the mainland behind us, not even a glowing\
  \ window of a house or the dim lamp of the dock light. The captains used flashlights\
  \ to illuminate each other\u2019s faces. From what I could gather, they argued over\
  \ returning or continuing on, and which direction South Water Caye actually lay\
  \ from where we currently bobbing in the waves. \n\nYet as I sat with the others,\
  \ damp from the spray of whipping through the water, waiting for our captains to\
  \ decide our fates, I realized I didn\u2019t want to go back, even if we could.\
  \ Salt water stung my lips, teasing my tongue as I inhaled a deep breath of warm,\
  \ tropical air that lingered above the waves. A glance at the sky showed an endless\
  \ expanse of stars, neither familiar nor foreign. The creak and slap of water against\
  \ the sides of the rough wood became a beat to the song of Kriol being slung between\
  \ our two boats. I no longer had control of where I was going or what I was doing,\
  \ but as our captains yelled their final words and fell silent, I felt comfortable\
  \ with the uncertainty. I knew I would find much more than I bargained for during\
  \ my two weeks in Belize\u2014exploring buried cities, learning native dances, feeding\
  \ wildlife in the rain-forest, walking through monkey sanctuaries while dodging\
  \ golden showers, and learning that I really can\u2019t canoe\u2014yet giving up\
  \ control gave me my freedom.\n \nFor a fleeting moment, the sounds of the ocean\
  \ around us mingled with our breathing. One breath. Maybe two. A second later, our\
  \ boat\u2019s motor turned over. Then the other. And we were once more skipping\
  \ across the water, taking us exactly where we were supposed to be."
