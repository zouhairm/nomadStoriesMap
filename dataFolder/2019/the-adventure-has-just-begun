Text: "My entire existence on earth has been confined to a place I like to call \u201C\
  the black hole of Canada\u201D which the outside world deems as Saskatchewan. I\
  \ call it this because it seems many people want to leave, however, whenever they\
  \ try to escape its vast emptiness they are hopelessly vacuumed back into its antagonizing\
  \ suction, doomed to walk alongside the looming sheaves of wheat for all of time.\n\
  \nGrowing up I was unable to travel much because my mother was a young single mom,\
  \ living on her own, also in university, which meant we didn\u2019t have much change\
  \ to spare for leisurely travel. Being restricted my whole life to a singular environment\
  \ where the scenery is rather bland and quite nonexistent has influenced me to crave\
  \ adventure on a global scale. I have always dreamed of the idea of moving away\
  \ to travel the globe but actually taking the necessary steps for venturing out\
  \ into the unknown absolutely terrified me to the bone. Until I did it.\n\nNearly\
  \ nine months ago I ventured to Toronto for a music festival. While in Ontario my\
  \ soul came to life after being stagnant and jailed for what seemed an eternity.\
  \ This trip completely changed my life. It was then I knew where the next chapter\
  \ of my life needed to be written.\n\nAs fate played its cards, it granted me the\
  \ opportunity to move to Ontario three short months later. It was off a whim. My\
  \ original plan had been to work while saving up money to make the big move. That\
  \ is not what happened. Not even close. I had been fired from a job, and had only\
  \ a measly thousand dollars in the bank; my life was looking grim. I was in a place\
  \ of having lost all hope of fulfilling my dream of making the great escape when\
  \ my friend, whom I had met at the festival in Toronto, told me she had just bought\
  \ a house; she then proceeded to invite me to live with her in that house. I jumped\
  \ on her offer without hesitation. I bought a one-way ticket to Toronto that night.\n\
  \nThree weeks later I left everything I had ever known behind, besides whatever\
  \ I could jam into two suitcases. I stepped aboard that plane ready with anticipation\
  \ for adventure to unroll itself at my feet. It was me against the world. Nothing\
  \ has ever felt as empowering as that moment had. With all the odds against me,\
  \ I was able to make my dream come true and because of that fact, that is how I\
  \ now know I am capable of achieving all of my dreams."
