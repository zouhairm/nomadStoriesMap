Text: "Things had to change and I absolutely needed space to gain perspective. I felt\
  \ like ending it with that cycle of always holding back. For as long as I could\
  \ remember my dreams were filled with tales of adventures. I always wanted to spontaneously\
  \ Go but I never had the guts, confidence, money or free time. I had no cash, no\
  \ more job and a wedding coming up but at this point nothing made sense anyway.\
  \ I booked the first flight I found and listened to Jape\u2019s advice: \u201C To\
  \ pack my bag and go wherever I like.\u201D\n\nI landed in Fort Lauderdale at 6h30\
  \ this morning.\_I found out that visiting the Everglades and Little Havana could\
  \ be trickier than expected due to various reason: extreme lack of planning, dangerously\
  \ hot temperatures in the month of june and no car. Nonetheless, I just made my\
  \ way to Miami Beach and it feels amazing! I\u2019m very happy with my choice of\
  \ lodging. The Miami Freehand looks pretty, it\u2019s clean, affordable and I found\
  \ the staff to be very cordial. Just my kind of place!! Sitting next door at Shepherd\
  \ Artisan Coffee I noticed an unusual little blue bus kept on showing up. Trolleybuses:\
  \ Thanks to them, I got to explore the area (for free) in the cool air, hopping\
  \ on and off, here and there.\n\nThe second day came more as a challenge. I spent\
  \ most of the morning having the hardest time shaking off the feeling of not belonging.\
  \ I\u2019ve passed into doubt and self-judgement, paralyzed by the idea of trying\
  \ to talk with someone: \u201CUgh! Helloooo? Anybody in there? You\u2019ve been\
  \ dreaming of doing this your entire life! Grab your camera! Clear your mind.\u201D\
  \ \n\nIts funny when i\u2019m looking through a lens, I don\u2019t feel like I usually\
  \ feel. Everything goes much slower. Nothing else matters because its all about\
  \ colours, lines and emotions. Feeling refreshed after wandering the Ocean Drive\
  \ I stumbled upon my two German roommates. A small polite conversation with Anii\
  \ & Janaleein blossomed surprisingly quickly into an invitation to join them to\
  \ the Everglades the next day! \n\nI often feel like I live in some kind of movie\
  \ and this morning was no exception. The three of us cruising the highway in a white\
  \ convertible Mustang. The sun, the wind and the music\u2026 I don\u2019t think\
  \ It could have been more Perfect!\_ What surprised me the most about The Everglade\
  \ National Park? Its magnitude! This 6,106.61\_km2 hot and humid environment is\
  \ a sanctuary to a thousand different insects, plants and animals species, including\
  \ the notorious American Alligators. Seeing one from so close and riding in those\
  \ loud airboat really nailed one of my oldest bucket list thing to do! I wish I\
  \ had more time with the girls but we had to part ways on that same afternoon. \n\
  \nBack to square one, I had absolutely no expectations for what came next. I came\
  \ across the hostel activity board and realized I could get a free lift to the renowned\
  \ Ball&Chain Salsa Bar in Little Havana. Could the stars just aligned?! It surely\
  \ feels like it since everything is just happening without any of my help. I was\
  \ quietly sitting at the pool when this warm-hearted Peruvian laughter lit up the\
  \ entire terrace! I started talking with Sophia and  Melissa. Funny thing they were\
  \ both signed up for salsa and by the time the bus picked us up our trio had grown\
  \ to a dozen.\n\nThat day went on forever! Between the multiples mojitos, the profound\
  \ conversations about Love and politics, learning how to dance salsa and the Freehand\
  \ after-party, I remember thriving on the idea that we all had that One thing in\
  \ common: A desire for understanding, acceptation and openness. Getting the opportunity\
  \ to meet all of them and learn about lives and values is definitely one of the\
  \ most enjoyable experiences I have ever had! Coming back home, all I wanted to\
  \ do was to share my experience. I felt so energized! Ultimately, getting out of\
  \ my comfort zone and facing my fears pushed me to reach further than ever before\
  \ and I couldn\u2019t be more enthusiastic about it!"
