Text: "I grew up in a very close church community, where we went to church every night\
  \ and - literally! - four times on Sunday. Being forced outside the community felt\
  \ incredibly strange, but it was solo travel on a shoestring budget that was the\
  \ true leap into the unknown!\n     I recently went on a cruise that allowed me\
  \ to visit multiple countries cheaply. My low budget meant I ended up walking miles\
  \ in Grenada, with a paper map and no phone, to reach a forest preserve that I was\
  \ interested in. The fifty dollar taxi fare was just too much to pay for the slight\
  \ possibility of seeing a rare bird, so, off I walked under the hot tropical sun,\
  \ where it seemed everyone knew everyone else, many vehicles beeping as they drove\
  \ along. \n     Eventually I got to a place where the map was unclear to me, so\
  \ I asked a woman for directions to Mount Hartman. As she was going that way, she\
  \ offered to show me the way. We eventually went up a dusty dirt road that she said\
  \ was a shortcut, where I started to wonder if I was being led into a trap, but\
  \ was just the road she took to say hello to one of her friends! She showed me the\
  \ lane I was supposed to turn down and told me that when I came back this way to\
  \ the main road, I could catch the \u201Cbus\u201D by the sign for the sanctuary.\
  \ Seeing the sign would also tell me I had found my way back to the right place\
  \ \u2013 and the bus would take me back to the port for one US dollar!!! \n    \
  \ The sanctuary had a couple signs, but no people around, and the building was all\
  \ locked up, so I\u2019m glad I didn\u2019t pay fifty bucks to get there! The forest\
  \ was peaceful and I did end up seeing a few birds that I had never seen before\
  \ (we birders call them \u201Clifers\u201D). There were butterflies, lizards, cactus\
  \ and cattle. There were even a couple of large bats hanging from a tree branch,\
  \ like someone forgot to take down the Halloween decorations!\n     After leaving\
  \ the reserve, I returned to the main road, where I waited for a bus while chickens\
  \ pecked around me. Eventually a white van came along with a number one in the front\
  \ window \u2013 the only indication that this wasn\u2019t just a private vehicle\
  \ \u2013 so I flagged it down and got on board, finding seventeen seats in a vehicle\
  \ that should hold seven! When we got to the intersection I had walked through previously,\
  \ the driver turned the other way and I wondered if I should have walked, but it\
  \ turned out we just had to drop a passenger off at the airport \u2013 miles the\
  \ other way from where I needed to go. Then we picked up another passenger along\
  \ the roadside and I realized that the friendly beeping heard while walking along\
  \ the road was just their way of advertising that they would be happy to pick you\
  \ up! The driver then pulled over in front of a house and hopped out, along with\
  \ his assistant, leaving some angry passengers while they went and got a drink (of\
  \ water, I think!). After a few minutes they reappeared and off we went again, picking\
  \ up and dropping off passengers every minute or two \u2013 even backing up to pick\
  \ up folks we had driven past. Another minute or two and we were close to a beautiful\
  \ beach, so I got out, bought some supplies from the local supermarket and relaxed\
  \ on the beach. The water taxi was only five dollars and it took me right back to\
  \ the cruise terminal, while providing great views of the shoreline.\n     Walking\
  \ alone without any way to contact anyone was a little unnerving, but it made for\
  \ an enriching experience that I am thankful for. I saw many sights and really felt\
  \ the local atmosphere that I would have missed if I had paid for the expensive\
  \ taxi!\n     I highly recommend walking or taking transit when visiting a new place\
  \ - it's a great, inexpensive way to meet the locals!"
