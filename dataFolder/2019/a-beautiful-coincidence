Text: "I've always enjoy having freedom, so after a very bad experience working in\
  \ France and having no time for myself I finished my french school I quit my job\
  \  and I went to Mexico to get far away from all the things that were consuming\
  \ me. Being home felt good -the food was like heaven - but even if I was living\
  \ the life, deep down I still knew I wanted to go back to France. I had the aim\
  \ for new experiences and Mexico wasn't doing much for me. It was just that - a\
  \ beautiful escape with good food and lovely people. \n\nAfter two months of full\
  \ enjoyment it was time for me to cross the ocean again. I arrived in Paris and\
  \ then went to Roen to see a friend of mine before heading to Lyon -In reality I\
  \ was just trying to avoid the real life- the train back  was long, but before making\
  \ myself too comfortable I went  to the bank to solve some problems I had that needed\
  \ to be solved.\n\nWhen I arrived to the bank I sat with my bank advisor to what\
  \ seemed to not be very good news, and the first words that came out of her mouth\
  \ were \"I'm sorry for your loss\" -  I was confused. I had no idea what she was\
  \ talking about - I looked at her with my eyes lost in confusion asking for an explanation\
  \ and she proceeded to say \"yes, if I'm not mistaken, the friend who helped you\
  \ open your account has died...\" - I was shocked, my heart was pumping and my mind\
  \ was going crazy, I was so confused I didn't even know what to feel - I started\
  \ asking questions that she couldn't answer because the private policy didn't let\
  \ her.\n\nI left the bank with my eyes full of tears feeling more confused than\
  \ ever. I started typing a message to his wife to make sure all that was only a\
  \ 'lie' and it was only a mistake, but the response I got was heartbreaking: \"\
  Il est deced\xE9\"  was written in the first line of the message and it was the\
  \ last thing I knew about them. \n\nI will never forget the first time I saw his\
  \ beautiful ineffable blue eyes and when we said goodbye without knowing that it\
  \ would actually be the last time we would see each other.\n\nI never expected to\
  \ find a wonderful human being such as him -therefore I will be forever grateful\
  \ -, he gave everything without expecting anything in return, he loved his kids\
  \ more than anything in the world - and personally I find that beautiful-\n\nHe\
  \ was exactly what my heart needed, he make me grow within myself and he show me\
  \ that love is supposed to be free."
