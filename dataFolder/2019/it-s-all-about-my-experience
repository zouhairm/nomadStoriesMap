Text: Hey I am from India basically I m not a travel blogger I am a food blogger I
  love to explore new places and I love to hear their stories about food and recipes
  and about their calture I believe food is the thing which reflects so many things
  about some one ever country have their own food and recipes like if we are taking
  about India every state has their own food and every good has their story so this
  is what I want to explore and apart from that I really love to about other cultures
  and about their lifestyle how they live what are their beliefs and so many other
  things I also have my YouTube channel but because of the time issue I dint work
  on that. According to me we can learn so many thanks from travel it makes us depend
  and in the process of discovering places and other things we discover ourselves
  we all need a break from our daily routine and traveling makes our life more beautiful
  and exciting this is what I believe and now coming to the place which I choose .I
  choose Switzerland but  I saw in so many movies it's a wonderful place and I m a
  nature loving person I love to connect with natura and love to hear the stories
  of mountains and want to feel that peace.
