Text: "\u201CThe wind blew gently around me as a troop of horses walked past me. It\
  \ was early December, and the air was chilly. The air was filled with fresh pine\
  \ and horse dung. The temperature had just fallen the night before and I was bundled\
  \ up in multiple layers of clothing. As I walked past the forested base of the mountain,\
  \ I was plagued by a strange thought. \u201CCan I climb this thing?\u201D Looking\
  \ up, I could barely spot the monastery from below. It was a three-storied structure\
  \ built literally in the middle of the mountain.\n I knew that the trek to the top\
  \ was supposed to be difficult for first timers, but I had no idea what I was signing\
  \ up for. The Tiger\u2019s Nest, or the Taktsang monastery is one of the most prominent\
  \ Buddhist sites in the Himalayas. People from all walks of life come for this trek\
  \ and they find an immense sense of fulfillment after completing it. So I really\
  \ wanted to finish the trek.\n The Tiger\u2019s Nest sits on a precarious mountain\
  \ cliff at a height of 3,120 meters. Built in 1692 by Gyalse Tenzin Rabgye, it has\
  \ seen its fair share of difficulties. Many hikers in the past had even lost their\
  \ lives. The path has loose gravel, sand and stone debris that makes it harder to\
  \ climb. It takes two to three hours on an average to complete the trek. However,\
  \ I took around four hours to climb. Even though my legs weren\u2019t tired, I couldn\u2019\
  t breathe easily. The air lacked oxygen and I couldn\u2019t stop panting. The trek\
  \ though difficult was beautiful. At certain places, we saw frozen water, transparent\
  \ yet white. After four tedious hours, we somehow reached the top. \nWe were strictly\
  \ not allowed to carry our mobile phones inside the monastery. So we were unable\
  \ to click any photographs. As we entered the monastery, we were welcomed by the\
  \ murals of the four guardian kings: Vaishravana (North), Dhritarashtra (East),\
  \ Virudhaka (South), Virupaksha (West), found in most Buddhist temples. The monastery\
  \ had a total of nine temples, of which eight were open for public viewing.  After\
  \ entering the monastery, we were first taken to the room with the massive rock\
  \ that bore the thumbprint of Guru Padmasambhava. It was believed that if you close\
  \ your eyes, put your thumb forward, and place your thumb at the exact position\
  \ of Guru Padmasambhava\u2019s thumbprint, then you can repay your parent\u2019\
  s debt in this lifetime. In our little group of twenty, only three would be fulfilling\
  \ their debts. \nEvery temple in the monastery had a different story. The first\
  \ temple was the spot where Guru Padmasambhava meditated for months. It was believed\
  \ that the third temple had special powers where all your wishes came true. The\
  \ second temple had an interesting story. Now, the three devotees who were carrying\
  \ Guru Padmasambhava\u2019s deity were unable to complete their task. So they decided\
  \ to break the deity even though the voice from the deity begged them not to do\
  \ so. At that moment, they suddenly encountered a huge man. He had more strength\
  \ than the three of them combined. The gigantic man joined the deity and took it\
  \ to the top. When the three men recounted their encounter to the rest of the people,\
  \ it was henceforth believed that the gigantic man was the reincarnation of Guru\
  \ Padmasambhava. The monastery has faced many fires, but strangely every time that\
  \ particular deity is left untouched.\nAs we spent time hearing the stories of the\
  \ Tiger\u2019s Monastery, most of my fatigue and body pain simply left me. I was\
  \ feeling so much better. The best was how the monastery derived its name. Now,\
  \ it was believed that Guru Padmasambahava left Tibet on the back of his disciple,\
  \ Yeshe Tsogyal, former wife of the emperor of Tibet. Yeshe Tsogyal had the unique\
  \ ability to transform into a flying tigress. That is why the spot where the present\
  \ monastery has been constructed was named as the tiger\u2019s nest. Surprisingly,\
  \ if you see the monastery from a different angle you can see a tiger\u2019s impression\
  \ on the mountain. For me this was the best experience."
