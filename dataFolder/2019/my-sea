Text: "Dear reader, you know, I promised myself that these seven months spent in Marseille\
  \ will remain only in my heart and on the instagram. What could be more simple than\
  \ not to write? Especially when you don\u2019t have a computer. I have only a tablet\
  \ that, damn it, always changes words as it wants, and now you see \u201Ctherapy\u201D\
  \ instead of \u201Ctart\u201D in the text. \nYou know, I remember my first day in\
  \ Marseille. It was September 22 of 2017. It was midday, the sun was scorching mercilessly,\
  \ and I was going down the still unfamiliar street St. Victor when I saw a wide\
  \ wooden staircase leading to the harbor of the old port. A step, two, three ...\
  \ When I finally got to the first one, a landscape opened up in front of me took\
  \ my breath away: a lot of boats and yachts that peacefully swayed on the waves\
  \ of the blue, like the sky, sea. Oh, if only I could draw! The air was filled with\
  \ the smell of salt and fish. The sent was so tart that I began to cough and then\
  \ cry, but not because I felt pain, but because I was extremely happy. For the first\
  \ time in my life, the miracle did not happen to the heroine of the Disney film,\
  \ but to me! Tourists wandered around, a guide suggested a tour to Ife Castle, and\
  \ local fishermen sold fresh fish and wonderful shells. It seemed to me that I was\
  \ the center of this world.\nBut you know, my dear reader, I will never tell my\
  \ mom what happened today. I will not tell her that in the subway a group of drunk\
  \ people stuck to me. They insisted that I drink a beer and spend the evening in\
  \ their company. One of them started to pat me, saying that he wants my pants. \
  \ Do you know what disturbed me most of all? That I could do nothing: there were\
  \ eight of them; in the subway car. I pretended to be a foreigner, not understanding\
  \ or speaking their native language. One of them said to the others: \"It will be\
  \ easy as a candy. She will go off in the old port.\" When the car stopped, I ran\
  \ to the second door and jumped out of the car almost on the move. I will never\
  \ admit to my dad that I ran headlong to the Radisson Blu hotel, which stands right\
  \ outside St. Victor\u2019s Abbey, looking for the people.  You know, I sat on the\
  \ floor for half an hour burst out crying,  while slamming the door of my small\
  \ apartment in Andoume. When, finally, I came down, I decided to wash the floor\
  \ at 2 am. For some reason, I did it with lavender oil, which I brought from a trip\
  \ to Avignon.\nAnd I own here one of the best things in the world - the sea.  If\
  \ only you can see how beautiful it is. No wonder the cost is called Azure. The\
  \ water is clear, and the plants and fish are so magical! In general, Marseille\
  \ is a wonderful city with many ancient areas, or, as they are called here, Cartier:\
  \ Longchamp Palace and a huge port. So I tell myself - what could be more beautiful\
  \ than spend seven months on the sea shores of the Mediterranean? The sea nourishes\
  \ the soul and body. It is a pity that at the end of September on the beaches of\
  \ Catalan and Prado it is unlikely to meet the hot guys, only the grannies who are\
  \ over sixty and who walk topless on the beach. They have a flash mob right here.\
  \ They are having fun, and I\u2019m blushing...But the most important thing is that\
  \ I feel lonely. All my relatives and friends are miles away from me and with a\
  \ time difference of four hours. I feel that this letters is too long, it's time\
  \ to tie up. \nTake care of you, \nyour Dana."
