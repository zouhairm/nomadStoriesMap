Text: "I am Gustavo, from Sao Paulo/Brazil, and I\u2019ll tell you about the dream\
  \ I'm living now - which started in May of 2017. No\u2026 Actually, it started in\
  \ mid-2016 effectively, and I\u2019ll tell you why.\n\nI say effectively because\
  \ I was planning this journey long before boarding my first plane, doing things\
  \ like:\n\nDream a lot about the whole trip.\nMake the final decision to do it and\
  \ convince me why it was so important.\nPrepare myself and my loved ones (for over\
  \ a year!) to get used to the idea of me being gone for a long time.\nPlan and execute\
  \ my dismissal request out of the awesome company I had been working on for more\
  \ than 8 years, along with other commitments I had.\nSell my apartment, my car,\
  \ and other personal belongings.\nIt took me over a year to go through all of that,\
  \ and by the time they were all done, I could finally feel completely ready to start\
  \ my journey. \n\nBut then\u2026 I looked at my pocket and realized I still did\
  \ not have all the money I needed to travel all the countries I wanted. It's a huge\
  \ world, you know! So, I searched online to find out different ways and possibilities\
  \ to work abroad during my travels. \n\nThe results I got were even better as I\
  \ figured out I could exchange volunteer work for other services, like accommodation,\
  \ food and etc!\n\nThat was exactly what I was searching for. For me, not only the\
  \ travel itself was an important part of the whole process, but to feel part of\
  \ local cultures abroad and learn the most I could from each one of them.\n\nSo,\
  \ I got on a plane to Japan and my journey had had finally begun! \n\nMany countries\
  \ later, I crossed the Cambodian border and applied to volunteer on an NGO to teach\
  \ English to local kids in a tiny village called Kampong Prieng, 25 km away from\
  \ Battambang, which is still a small city but the third biggest of Cambodia.\n\n\
  This has been the best experience I've had in my life!\nFirst of all, the host is\
  \ a very nice and fun Spanish guy, who I could relate with right away after a warm\
  \ welcoming. He is one of the managers of HDLF (Human Resource Development & Language\
  \ Foundation), which is an NGO founded in 2015 by a very good-hearted Cambodian\
  \ teacher and his family. No wonder he is called \u201CMan Kind\u201D there. The\
  \ NGO goal is to build English schools around the country and help them become functional\
  \ and sustainable once they're in place.\n\nBefore continuing to read this, please\
  \ take some time to learn about the Cambodian history. It is very tough and, especially\
  \ during the Pol Pot\u2019s Khmer Rouge regime, really challenging.\n\nMy experience\
  \ as a volunteer was helping on the second school they are building (which has more\
  \ than 130 students now!). The food and accommodation in the school are simple (no\
  \ Western toilets or showers there), which gave me a whole new perspective of living.\n\
  \nI did build walls, teach English, cook, participate in rice farming, help as a\
  \ gardener, and whatever other functions they needed me to do. In fact, I even decided\
  \ to stay almost the entire month there.\n\nThis has been the best experience of\
  \ my life at so many levels. Helping those kids is something that completely stroke\
  \ me. \nI also learned that you don\u2019t need much to be happy (like a Western\
  \ shower or toilet) and that, to make another person happy, you don't need much.\n\
  \nI learned a lot by volunteering in an NGO in Cambodia and I will definitely come\
  \ out of this experience a much more complete human being than I was before. \n\n\
  With all my heart, thank HDLF team and all students, which I now call friends:\n\
  \"Arkoun!\", as they would say there : )"
