Text: "The hamlet of Pangniqtuuq, Nunavut sits 30 miles shy of the latitude line 66'33\
  \ \u2013 a minor technicality separating the town from the arctic circle doing little\
  \ to differentiate itself from the arctic climate, landscape and lifestyle.\n\n\
  Rocks, ice and snow form the mountainous landscape of Pangniqtuuq, carving a fjord\
  \ that leads through the Auyuittuq National Park. Black, blue and white primarily\
  \ colour the natural landscape in the freezing months, creating a picturesque yet\
  \ monotonous scene. The towering granite mountains cast a shadow upon the hamlet,\
  \ hiding the little sunlight available during the winter months. Somber and sunless,\
  \ it can be a bleak and bare existence in the town\u2026\n\nThis sub-arctic hamlet,\
  \ with its barren winter landscape, provided a blank canvass for me to start a new\
  \ adventure. Arriving at the end of winter, the scene was most unwelcoming and isolating.\
  \ My initial flights were delayed due to blizzard conditions, making me question\
  \ the validity of this daring decision to travel and work in this hamlet on my own.\
  \ Upon my arrival, thick low clouds blanketed the infamous snow-capped mountain\
  \ peaks for which Pangniqtuuq were famous. It was a bleak blank start.\n\nThen the\
  \ thaw season arrived. Daubs of colour started appearing in my blank canvass. As\
  \ professional connections merge into personal ties, friendship developed through\
  \ shared experiences. And very soon I found myself hosting a roommate every few\
  \ weeks. My lone survival budding into living with company. \n\nAs the ice thawed\
  \ from rock cliffs and mountain peaks, the tundra blossomed into an Eden of miniature\
  \ waterfalls and springs with vibrant yet unassuming arctic flowers. The wild, unpretentious\
  \ beauty of the tundra captivated our minds to explore and discover. The trailhead\
  \ was our doorstep. It only took one step to start.\n\nAs the sea ice broke, the\
  \ fjord, devoid of any activity except for snow machines throughout the winter,\
  \ teemed with marine excitement. Cruise ships, cargo barges, fishing boats and large\
  \ cetaceans crowded the narrow fjord. Families of bowhead whales and belugas floated\
  \ by, some seeking refuge from the hunting orcas. We had no television, but the\
  \ living room looked out to the fjord. We were audience to nature\u2019s show. \n\
  \nIt was in this sub-arctic hamlet that I found fulfillment. Though my stay was\
  \ ephemeral as planned, the memories were lasting. I discovered balance, found camaraderie,\
  \ and attained a life filled with a strong sense of achievement, belonging, and\
  \ fun. I only expected to exist in this hamlet and survive working and living in\
  \ a small, rural, arctic town. I did not expect to find such bounty and live life\
  \ excitingly."
