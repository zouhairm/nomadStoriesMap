Text: "The final strap was being carefully tightened on the harness. The click of\
  \ the links sounded notably amplified as the guide had undertaken the rigorous last\
  \ minute checks. \n\nLincoln, my 11-year-old son was bracing himself for a ride\
  \ of a lifetime, notching up yet another challenge on our great adventure. He was\
  \ about to embark on a giant leap into the unknown. He cast his blue eyes towards\
  \ me.  If he was feeling nervous at that moment, the expression on his face did\
  \ not betray him.\n\nIt was a chilly October day and the cloudless sky shone brightly.\
  \  I heard the faint sound of the waters gushing through the gorge below.  My mind\
  \ drifted back to the past.  Decades before, I stood at the same location as a young\
  \ woman, with nervous trepidation at the birthplace of extreme sport, contemplating\
  \ if I would face my own fears. \n\nNew Zealand was as exhilarating as I had remembered,\
  \ with changing vivid skylines; dramatic canyons weaved through the rocky landscape,\
  \ surrounded by snow-capped mountains and refreshingly cool.\n\nThe AJ Hackett facility\
  \ had grown considerably, now a tourist hot spot, which had drawn large crowds of\
  \ spectators and thrill seekers in pursuit of their own 'live fearlessly' quest.\
  \ The facility was buzzing with incessant banter and echoes of nervous laughter.\
  \   People from all over the globe congregated to unite in the Hackett phenomenon\
  \ - \"Live More, Fear Less\".  This was home to the original and most famous bungy.\
  \  A quick 30-minute drive from Queenstown - dubbed the adventure capital of the\
  \ world. \n\nMy gaze returned to my young son. His dad was right there beside him,\
  \ offering him words of encouragement and comfort.  Linc appeared to be excited\
  \ about racing with his dad on the zip line, alongside the emerald coloured waters\
  \ of the Kawarau River. \n\nA debate was going on in my mind. This was a young boy,\
  \ whose self-esteem plummeted and deteriorated at such a tender age, plunged into\
  \ crippling anxiety during the past year. Fears now consumed his world and he struggled\
  \ to find himself.  New Zealand had been a magnet for every nature lover, winter\
  \ sports enthusiast and adrenaline junkie for many years.  The adventures had only\
  \ grown bolder and more dramatic.  Would all of the new experiences from a visit\
  \ to the Land of the Long White Cloud help our son to take on a different perspective\
  \ of the world and live life more fearlessly?\n\nHe moved cautiously out onto the\
  \ launch platform, feet lifted up from the ledge, precariously dangling over the\
  \ gorge, hundreds of metres above the steep, grassy banks below.  In the distance,\
  \ I saw the young explorers as they bungy jumped off the Kawarau Bridge, gracefully\
  \ diving down towards the icy cold waters of the gorge. Collective cheers heard\
  \ from all the spectators with each brave, heart-stopping leap. \n\nEquipped with\
  \ a Go-Pro in hand, Lincoln flashed me one final look. He gave me a confident thumbs\
  \ up and smiled broadly as he was released off the platform.  The zip line propelled\
  \ at over 60 kilometres an hour travelling 130 metres parallel to the canyon and\
  \ in an instant; the ride came to an abrupt halt, shunting both of them wildly into\
  \ the air.\n\nThe guide manoeuvred the ride to turn the harnesses around so that\
  \ the boys were faced towards the platform and they were gently brought back to\
  \ the jump area.  As Linc approached, I saw that he had a look of elation etched\
  \ into his face and a deep sense of pride, that not only had he faced his fears\
  \ but also that he had conquered them.\n\nAs soon as he was in earshot, he screamed\
  \ with pure joy - \"I want to do that again! - This time, SUPERMAN STYLE!\"\n\n\
  I smiled to myself.  Tentative steps into a new frontier, now fuelled with his New\
  \ Zealand superpowers.  It was heart-warming to watch as his Kryptonite began to\
  \ slowly fade away."
