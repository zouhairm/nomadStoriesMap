Text: "I was crying and walking in the dark, just couldn\u2019t control myself. The\
  \ tears had made their way all over my cheeks. I didn\xB4t have any makeup on, or\
  \ at least not where it should be. I felt a huge pressure in my chest and definitely\
  \ didn\xB4t know what to do.\n\nI land London at Hearthrow Airport and headed in\
  \ search of the train station. I stopped at an ATM to take some pounds for my trip.\
  \  I waited for my money and at the exact moment it went out of the machine a man\
  \ took my money and my credit card and star running. I didn\xB4t know what to do,\
  \ it was already 10 pm and I couldn\u2019t believe what just happened, it\xB4s a\
  \ first world country, that wasn\u2019t what I was waiting at all. In my head I\
  \ imagine that some policemen would come out of nowhere and they would arrest the\
  \ thief and would return my belongings. But then I realized I wasn\u2019t on a movie\
  \ where magically something like that would happen.\n\nThe ticket collector talked\
  \ on the radio and I got to travel on the train to my destination, which wasn\xB4\
  t far away. I came out of the train station with the certainty that I would be alright\
  \ as long I arrived at the hotel. I push the door and enter, the place was dark\
  \ and scary, the man on the front desk was somnolent, without encouragement he assisted\
  \ me, he asked me for my passport and my credit card. I explained I had been robbed.\
  \ \n\u201CJust go away.\u201D He said. I could not believe it. \n\u201CLady if you\
  \ don\xB4t have money you better go away.\u201D\n\u201CCan I at least make a phone\
  \ call?\u201D\n\u201CYou are bothering me, and I\xB4m losing my time on you.\u201D\
  \n\nI went out, turn to my right hand and I walked.  I was lost in an unknown country,\
  \ even a different continent. I started feeling paranoid. A handsome man walked\
  \ towards me and spoke to me, I explained my situation. \n\u201CYou could come to\
  \ my place, you\xB4ll be fine and tomorrow I don\xB4t work so we can find someone\
  \ that can help you.\u201D He said.\n\u201CReally?\u201D\n\u201CYou are gorgeous,\
  \ and we can reach an agreement.\u201D He said.\n\u201CYea, well I\u2019ll pass\
  \ your kind offer, I\xB4m in trouble, and I\xB4m not looking for more.\u201D\n\n\
  I started walking fast and didn\xB4t turn around, I was furious, the whole situation\
  \ was a disaster. The impotence was making me really scared.  After a moment of\
  \ walking I calm down, I saw a Sainsbury\xB4s and realized it was open 24 hours.\
  \ I enter and notice I needed a membership to buy and to be there. The manager saw\
  \ me and asked how he could help me. I felt like an intruder. I guess everyone could\
  \ tell I was having a bad moment because I looked like a misaligned raccoon, and\
  \ my eyes were completely swollen and red. I explained everything, with details\
  \ and he looked concerned. He was about forty-five years old. \n\n\u201CStay here\
  \ until the sunrise.\u201D\n\nHe told me to sit down on a chair that was close to\
  \ the bathroom. I started to fall asleep, he came back and said, \u201CYou can\xB4\
  t sleep here. Wake up and go and grab some food. I\xB4ll talk to the cashier.\u201D\
  \xB4\nI grab a sandwich and a coke. He gave the money to the cashier. \nI could\
  \ only said, \u201CThank you.\u201D\n\nHe came close again and said. \u201CI\xB4\
  m from Ghana and I know how difficult it can be to be alone.\u201D\n\nAt that moment\
  \ some police entered to buy groceries, I asked if they knew where it was my embassy.\
  \ They communicated with someone on the radio and they wrote the address on my map\
  \ and explained me how to get there. \nThe morning came and the manager said goodbye,\
  \ he hold my hand, I felt a rolled paper. \u201CDon\xB4t open your hand until you\xB4\
  re outside the store.\u201D \nI asked him to write me his address on the map and\
  \ he did. \nOutside I open my hand, there were twenty pounds and a letter, \u201C\
  I wish you the best.\u201D\n\nA friend came out of nowhere.\n\nCielo Ju\xE1rez"
