Text: "I hated Italy. The moment I walked out of the airport, I huffed and puffed\
  \ white smoke. The Spring breeze cut through my thin blue shirt, and my mom gave\
  \ me a jacket to wear. Of course I smiled at her as I took it. I showed her and\
  \ my dad, smoking beside her, how happy I was to finally be with them after 6 years.\
  \ I wore the thick brown jacket and my body felt a little less cold. The gray buildings\
  \ right before me and their blue sky, sunny morning backdrop were lifeless and nonsense.\
  \ I couldn\u2019t wait to go back home.\n\nI went to Duomo, the city center, as\
  \ a tourist son of overseas workers. I took a photo in front of the white-marbled\
  \ cathedral with my family as part of the tourist act when you visit a country,\
  \ or, in my case, when I decided to see the reason why I didn\u2019t grow up in\
  \ the arms of a mom and a dad. I heard the counting from the stranger holding our\
  \ camera: \u201C1...2...3\u2026\u201D and I pretended to smile.\n\nAs we walked\
  \ around Duomo, my mom pointed out the spots where she would usually meet my dad\
  \ after their jobs. I didn\u2019t listen well, but watch the prison cell she called\
  \ Milan to check where I could buy tickets, eat cuisine that\u2019s not local, and\
  \ go for grocery shopping in an Asian supermarket. I looked at my mom as joy glazed\
  \ her eyes while she was fawning over the beauty of the city and how grateful she\
  \ was that Italy allowed me to reunite with her after years. I glanced at my father,\
  \ just right behind her, wearing a full-blown smile while holding the camera pointed\
  \ at us. I couldn\u2019t understand the celebration they had in them, but day by\
  \ day, I\u2019d grown to see pieces of their reasons.\n\nI joined them in their\
  \ everyday job, helping my mom fold clothes and prepare food for the priests of\
  \ a religious brotherhood. I tied the black garbage bag and asked my dad where he\
  \ would throw it. I drank a glass of water before I went upstairs to clean the carpets\
  \ with a vacuum. Then I got tired. I sat down in the kitchen area and my parents\
  \ told me to eat something. I watched them run back and forth to complete their\
  \ daily tasks, picking up where I left off.\n\nWhen a woman in her 60s walked in\
  \ the kitchen and called my parents, she handed them a thick white envelope. They\
  \ thanked her and told me, \u201Cwe can finally send this to your sister in the\
  \ Philippines so she can buy those sacks of rice and bottles of cooking oil good\
  \ for a month.\u201D My lips thinned as part of me understood why they had to leave\
  \ my home country to take care of other people instead of me.\n\nWe walked out of\
  \ the rectory, the white envelope still stuck between my mom\u2019s fingers. The\
  \ street lights illuminated the dark street. It was a starless sky in a quiet night,\
  \ but somehow the concrete jungle unraveled its beauty and it began to feel less\
  \ daunting by the minute. When the next dawn rose, I was back in the airport with\
  \ a luggage at hand. I gave the return ticket to the attendant by the gate and turned\
  \ around to see my parents waving goodbye. No longer was the joy present, but longing\
  \ again. And I knew I would be back."
