Text: "The year is 2016, i was 22 years old, when I decided to go abroud alone for\
  \ a exchange program. When I took the decision to go I was very confident that I\
  \ could do that, and that would be an amazing experience, but when the day to go\
  \ was aproching, i started to be afraid of the unknown and the language difference\
  \ and if i would be able to make friends and to talk to people, in this case, if\
  \ my english would be good enough for people understand me.\nWhen the time to go\
  \ came, i was very nervous to go to the plane. But I took a deep breath and I did\
  \ it, I entered to the plane.\nThe first stop before Ireland, was Holland. When\
  \ I arrived everything was new for me, but I felt that I took the right decision.\
  \ After a few hours waiting , i arrived in Ireland, and the things started to go\
  \ not so well. The company lost my bags, i was late to took my drive to the host\
  \ family. But in the end, even scare for maybe had to sleep at airport, everything\
  \ went fine.\nWas midnight when i arrived at the host family home, my first thoughts\
  \ was, nice house, nice neighborhood, maybe I did the right thing. The host mom\
  \ offered a tea, an Irish tea,  was a very good tea, and  when I asked about my\
  \ room I had one surprise. I asked for a single room, and there wasn't a single\
  \ room when i get there. I was suppose to share the room with a nice french girl,\
  \ that was waiting for me with the host mom, when i arrived at the house. I didn't\
  \ care much to share the room, because I shared my room with my little sister for\
  \ about  20 years, so that's ok, I thought. And the girl was so sweet and kind to\
  \ me, that I thought ok, I think was going to be nice to share the room after all.\n\
  The first day in Ireland was very interesting. I woke up, had to were the same clothes,\
  \ cause the company was still searching for my bags. My first thought was, the Irish\
  \ breakfast is not so different from Brazil. I had cereal, bread and jelly, Irish\
  \ tea and juicy. The only difference was the Irish tea actually. After the breakfast,\
  \ the host mom explained how to get the bus stop to go to the city center. Amandine,\
  \ my roommate was with me. And we talk about everything on the way to the city.\
  \ Was very nice, I learned a lot about France. \nWhen we get to the city center,\
  \ I thought that I studied in different school from my roommate. So she went to\
  \ school, when I tried to find alone my school. Was very funny, because the school\
  \ was very near, and i got lost and took the longest way to get there. Poor me,\
  \ i thought was the only time that i would be lost. But until the end of the exchange\
  \ program, i got lost like a hundred times. But it's like a rule when you are by\
  \ yourself exploring a different country.\nThe first school day was very nice, when\
  \ I got there, they applied a test, to discover what was my english level. I was\
  \ in level B2, almost advanced. When the class started another surprise, almost\
  \ everyone was from Brazil, in my class. Actually i really liked that, because i\
  \ felt more close to my country. And even spoken the same language, we always spoke\
  \ english. Because everyone was there to improve the language after all. So that's\
  \ what we did. \nAfter the class, i was very happy because i ended up making a lot\
  \ of friends and we talked about meet each other in front of school to got to a\
  \ pub. When we got to the pub, I had my first Guinness. And I discover my love for\
  \ beer in that, I'm sure of it. \nSo what can I say about all of this, is even if\
  \ you are afraid to go explore, meet new people, you have to go. Do it."
