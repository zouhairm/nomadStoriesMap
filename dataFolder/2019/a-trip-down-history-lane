Text: "In many different cultures, fairies are creatures that are associated with\
  \ all the good of the world. They will whisk you away to a wonderful adventure to\
  \ fight against pirates and what not. Or sometimes, they will simply bring you a\
  \ penny in exchange for your tooth. In the Highlands of Scotland however, the legends\
  \ of the fairies has taken a decidedly darker turn. Fairies in Scottish legends\
  \ are devious little creatures, they kidnap unsuspecting wanderers in the wood at\
  \ night, at least that is how my local tour guide puts it.\n\nAs I was touring all\
  \ around Inverness, I have joined a local tour which took me across the infamous\
  \ Loch Ness lake, and to the now ruin castle of Urquhart. If anyone have seen 1995\
  \ cult classic film, Braveheart, would know, Scotland had a long and bloody history\
  \ regarding the war whether it be against the English, or the wars within. \n\n\
  I waited for quite some time at the docks for the tour boat, the weather was erratic\
  \ at best, quite literally I can feel the rainfall is spilt right in between the\
  \ dock. To my right it is rather Sunny, warm and calm, to my left, tidal wave come\
  \ crashing onto the dock violently. This to give meaning to what \"British weather\"\
  \ meant and why weather is such a big topic for the British day to day lives. \n\
  \nFinally, the tour boat arrives, without hesitation, I took to the deck, looking\
  \ left and right for the now infamous monster of the lake, Nessie.\nNessie is such\
  \ an interesting creatures within the \"lore of monsters\". Everyone knows Godzilla\
  \ is fictional, but Nessie? With so many sighting of Nessie over the centuries,\
  \ one cannot help but wonder. As saying goes, \"there is always a bit of truth in\
  \ legends\".\n\nUnder the recommendation of the tour guide, I took to the passenger\
  \ deck of the tour boat, went to the food counter, and ordered a cup of delicious\
  \ \"Highland Chocolate\". Being the naive person, I haven't the faintest clue to\
  \ what it means. I took a few sip and quickly become intoxicated because it is made\
  \ with a bit of Whiskey.\n\nAs the tour boat docked and I am allowed onto this once\
  \ sacred land, I can feel the lore of this land come rushing out towards me. Every\
  \ brick, every rubble was there for a reason, centuries old conflict flashes in\
  \ front of my eyes for just a spilt second. As if I was transported through time,\
  \ participating in these sieges myself. \n\nI stepped into a theatre, and was shown\
  \ a short film introducing us to the history of this ruin. The film detailed conflicts\
  \ that I have never heard of, nonetheless, I was quickly drawn into the lore this\
  \ place, the mysteries and the wonders. At the end of the film, the curtains pulled\
  \ back showing us a grand view of the castle and the Loch Ness Lake. After being\
  \ shown the full history of the place, seeing this view and understanding the history\
  \ behind the ruins. \n\nAs my journey come to a close, I must bid them farewell\
  \ and conclude my trip. It is such a transformative experience and I would highly\
  \ recommend anyone who wish explore ancient ruins and love learning about history\
  \ to give Inverness and Loch Ness lake a shot."
