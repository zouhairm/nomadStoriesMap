Text: "The head.\n\n\u201CWhen we protest, we wear a lot of make-up, you know. In\
  \ order to be seen we use the accessories, we are entitled to put on every day.\
  \ The idea is to show we are there and tell the world to listen to us,\u201D Valeria\
  \ explained enthusiastically, barely taking time to catch her breath. She quickly\
  \ touched the tips of her brown curly hair and then, almost immediately, she resumed\
  \ talking: \u201CFemicides, the right to abortion, so many fights are ahead of us.\
  \ We have goals and we, the mass of people who feel underrepresented by our government\
  \ and deputies, we will persist. Should we move inside?\u201D she stopped her narration\
  \ only because a big raindrop splashed on her forehead and continued its journey\
  \ between her eyes and nose before it ended on her plate, on the top of the vegetable\
  \ pizza we shared.\n\n\u201CSure, why not,\u201D I responded, already wet from the\
  \ warm summer rain. As we grabbed the plates and were moving inside, she did not\
  \ hesitate to continue talking. \u201COh, and you were asking about the green handkerchiefs\
  \ \u2026 Firstly, the National campaign for legal, safe and free abortion was giving\
  \ them for free, now you have to pay for them. Think of it as the support for our\
  \ fight. As you can see, we are wearing them all the time, they became the symbol\
  \ of our demands. Am I talking too fast, do you understand me?\u201D \u201CYes,\u201D\
  \ I nodded. \u201CEverything is well understood.\u201D\n\nIn Buenos Aires, the city\
  \ where the sounds of chaos, quilombo, create the energetic, inspiring daily routine,\
  \ the feminist ideas are, indeed, well understood. Green triangular handkerchiefs,\
  \ pa\xF1uelos, symbols of an inclusive fight for a better future can be seen everywhere.\
  \ Girls and boys have them tied to their backpacks or wrists. On public transport,\
  \ in the classrooms, at work, at the concerts. All the time. The handkerchiefs are\
  \ present even in their homes; when personal becomes political these people do not\
  \ let others tell their story nor manipulate their principles.\n\nThe tail.\n\n\
  About five hundred kilometres away, in the small village of Pilar in the Santa Fe\
  \ province, the liberating freedom of mind that found its way to the streets of\
  \ the Argentinian capital becomes a faded memory. A souvenir from a reality that\
  \ seems to belong to another time and place. Here, you will not see a handkerchief\
  \ tied to anyone's wrist.\n\nIn Pilar, everyone knows everyone and there is very\
  \ little to do. If Buenos Aires embraces differences, Pilar, where machismo seems\
  \ to be unlimited, tends to prefer uniformity. In order to gain societal respect\
  \ young girls regularly have sex with older boys and men, they get pregnant and\
  \ while doing so they do not realise that the respect they obtained might be pathetically\
  \ false. They do not see \u2013 at least not yet \u2013 it is actually its own antithesis,\
  \ nothing but the result of oppressive cultural patterns.\n\nSixteen-year-old Sabrina\
  \ is one of them. Like her mother and grandmother, she is the child of the village.\
  \ Regularly attending parties where girls are supposed to show as much skin as possible,\
  \ she enjoys the feeling of belonging in her society. However, she might prove to\
  \ be the wind of change Pilar needs in order to transform for good. \u201CIt is\
  \ my right to decide over my body,\u201D she stated with a determined voice during\
  \ a New Year's Eve dinner as all the other guests were ready to fight her arguments.\
  \ This girl, who made her own triangular handkerchief because in Pilar they cannot\
  \ be bought, argued with them patiently, carefully choosing her well-articulated\
  \ thoughts.\n\nThe coin.\n\nTwo sides of one coin, that is what they are \u2013\
  \ Valeria, an educated woman in her early thirties from one of the richest districts\
  \ of Buenos Aires, and Sabrina, a teenager from a small village in central Argentina.\
  \ They do not only reflect the contrasts of the society, but are, more importantly,\
  \ a prediction of what the country one day might become. Both children of their\
  \ environment they do not only tell the story of less discriminatory world \u2026\
  \ They are the story."
