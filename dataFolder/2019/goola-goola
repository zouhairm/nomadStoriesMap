Text: "Goola goola!\n\nLate in the first day of our trek through Toraja, my guide,\
  \ Semi, and I neared a small village. The houses were elevated and were still built\
  \ to resemble the boats that had brought the first settlers here from Vietnam, hundreds\
  \ of years earlier.  As we reached the first houses, we heard the slapping of small,\
  \ bare feet on the clay, laughter, and screams of \u201CGoola goola!\u201D (\"Candy!\"\
  ) \n\nSince the Dutch colonial period, travelers through Toraja (in upland Sulawesi,\
  \ in central Indonesia) have carried candy to give the local children.  As I swung\
  \ off my daypack and dug the little bags of M&Ms from the bottom, Semi chatted with\
  \ the children in what sounded like yet another language.  So far, he had spoken\
  \ English, Dutch, Indonesian (a variety of Malay), and Torajan.\n\nSemi relayed\
  \ that it had been a long time since any outsiders had passed through.  The younger\
  \ children in fact had never even seen a Westerner.  One girl of perhaps eight asked,\
  \ through Semi, if she could touch my hair, which is light brown and so was unfamiliar\
  \ to her.  I stooped so she could, rewarding her boldness. \n\nOn this trek I noticed\
  \ that the children at each village demonstrated the same ambivalence toward me.\
  \  They were uniformly curious, friendly, and accepting, but could turn instantly\
  \ shy if I asked a question or raised my camera to take their picture. \n\nThese\
  \ same children who had run up to me screaming for candy now grew skittish as I\
  \ raised my camera and asked \u201CClick click?\u201D while bobbing my head.  They\
  \ shrieked and scattered, except for a couple of the older boys.  Hoping their decampment\
  \ was a sort of coy game, I remained and let the boys examine \u2013 if not handle\
  \ \u2013 my Nikon.  This did the trick.  Not wanting to be left out, the others\
  \ returned and were convinced by promises of more chocolate to gather for a group\
  \ shot.\n\nThe eyes say it all.  The oldest boy stands to the left, holding his\
  \ sister\u2019s hand and tentatively accepting his role as leader of the group.\
  \  Behind him and backing him up is his lieutenant, bold and mischievous. The boy\
  \ in the red is friendly and open, but content to hang back.  The leader\u2019s\
  \ sister smiles in spite of her fears, supported by her more cautious friend.  The\
  \ brave little girl who touched my hair has joined the shot at the last second and\
  \ so has to peer over the others. And the youngest boy is almost lost in the middle.\
  \  They huddle, holding and supporting each other.  \n\nI smile back.  \n \n[Obviously,\
  \ there is a photo which accompanies this story. May I send it somehow?]"
