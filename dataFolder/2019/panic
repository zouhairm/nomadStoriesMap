Text: "I\u2019ve always boasted about my internal compass, saying, \u201Chow could\
  \ anyone get lost, just retrace your steps.\u201D That is, until it happened to\
  \ me.\n\nIt\u2019d been a decade since I hiked the unmarked trail to Indian Staircase\
  \ through the Daniel Boone National Forest in the Red River Gorge. Usually, I camped\
  \ with my dog who couldn\u2019t make it up the rock climbing trail. This time, I\
  \ went alone.\n\nI woke to a muggy Kentucky morning, which led to the ferociously\
  \ hot mid-July day. After breakfast, I packed two large water bottles, an energy\
  \ bar and lunch. I felt prepared for the four mile hike. I was off.\n\nWhen hiking\
  \ unmarked trails there\u2019s always the feeling of, did I miss that turn? Is this\
  \ the right way? Maybe I should turn around. But being optimistic, I kept going\
  \ hoping the way would reveal itself. The right turn finally came, shooting straight\
  \ uphill.\n\nI came to the base of the Staircase - a 120 degree cliff with holes\
  \ carved in the rock for grip and a deadly fall down both sides. It was exhilarating.\
  \ The sandstone was gritty on my palms and the sun even more fierce atop the ridge\
  \ without the protection of trees.\n\nThe full-circle view presented miles of luscious\
  \ forest. I imaged how the glacier carved this gorge. I was atop the world. Nothing\
  \ existed besides the eagles soaring at eye-level.\n\nThe climb wasn\u2019t too\
  \ difficult, but backtracking would be too dangerous. The unmarked trail was made\
  \ into a loop. If only I could remember the way. I came to the familiar landmark\
  \ named frog\u2019s head, a prominent rock which jutted out over the ridge resembling\
  \ a head. This reassured me I was on the right track. With that piece of mind, I\
  \ decided to eat lunch.\n\nI knew the next landmark to look for was a rock arch.\
  \ I followed the ridge as it became heavily wooded with no trail. I made too many\
  \ turns with no markers. I had no idea where I was or where I came from. I was lost.\n\
  \nI tried retracing my steps, but every direction looked the same. I knew I was\
  \ going in circles because there was a recurring horrific smell of something dead\
  \ like nothing I\u2019ve smelt before. It was close. The panic set in. Was that\
  \ smell foreshadowing my fate? Was it a bear close by who\u2019d made a recent attack?\n\
  \nI ran out of water and my food was long gone. The sun was still strong, but on\
  \ the other side of noon setting fast. The panic grew. I started talking to my father,\
  \ who recently passed away, \u201CCome on dad, help me out. Show me where to go.\
  \ Please!\u201D\n\nI thought I saw someone out the corner of my eye. I yelled, but\
  \ there was no response. Maybe I was hallucinating. There was no giving up. I picked\
  \ a direction and kept pushing through branches thinking about what I had with me,\
  \ if I had to stay the night. I needed to find water, but there\u2019s no water\
  \ up that high and no rain in the forecast. The smell was back.\n\nAll of a sudden,\
  \ I ran straight into a park ranger, face to face. We were both startled. I screamed\
  \ I was lost and asked for help. \u201CRight now, I\u2019d rather help you than\
  \ look for a dead body\u201D he said. I was taken aback. I told him about the smell.\
  \ He had been out there following the same smell, looking for a missing person.\
  \ Someone reported a stray dog nearby and the smell.\n\nFor thirty minutes, I followed\
  \ him around as he searched for a body, staying far enough back so I wouldn\u2019\
  t have to see. \u201CPeople get lost up here all the time or fall off cliffs\u201D\
  \ he said. \n\nAfter no findings, he led me to safety at the base of the trail.\
  \ I thanked him, but I was still in shock. That unfortunate person was still missing.\
  \ I couldn\u2019t help but think, that could have been me. What were the chances\
  \ of a ranger being at the same spot and time in the middle of a forest? I\u2019\
  ve always thanked my dad for that."
