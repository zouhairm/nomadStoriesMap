Text: "I am the coldest I\u2019ve ever been. At a chilly minus 5 degrees Celsius I\
  \ waddle across Milan like a mattress with legs. When I spot her next to the fountain,\
  \ waiting for me. Windswept blonde hair, her eyes searching, wondering if I\u2019\
  m lost in the subway. I wave at her from across the street and her whole face smiles.\
  \ I see happiness mixed with relief. Upon reaching the fountain, Giorgia pulls me\
  \ into an awkward hug, which I instinctively return. She is taking me on a Patisserie\
  \ Tour in Milan. It is her first time conducting the tour and my first trip to Milan\
  \ so, as two-first timers we walk side by side to discover Milan\u2019s delicacies.\n\
  \nOur first stop Pasticceria Ranieri is a traditional bakery in Milan, that has\
  \ been around since 1967. Everything is freshly baked, every day. The owner, Maurizio\
  \ Rana stands proud behind his counter, gently coaxing us to try different things.\
  \ I don\u2019t understand his Italian, but I understand his passion. The passion\
  \ that drives him to wake up every morning and bake. A long time ago, that was me.\
  \ Behind the counter, proud of the croissants I saw across plates at breakfast.\
  \ Smiling to myself, I feel his passion course through my veins, and I give in.\n\
  \nI scan the display case till I spot a tray of Sfogliatelle. Curious about this\
  \ layered puff pastry, shaped like a curved cone with custard cream peeking out\
  \ from inside, I point at it and Maurizio smiles. He holds his hand up as if to\
  \ say, \u201Cwait!\u201D He goes into the kitchen that I can see through a glass\
  \ partition and brings one piece off a tray to hand it over on a paper napkin. The\
  \ pastry is warm and liberally dusted with icing sugar. I take one bite, and it\
  \ transports me to a world where calories don\u2019t count, and I can eat pastry\
  \ for breakfast, lunch, and dinner.\n\nGiorigia is talking to me but, I don\u2019\
  t hear a thing. I finish my Sfogliatella slowly, savouring the mouthfeel of this\
  \ light and airy pastry oozing mildly sweet custard. Once I\u2019m done, I apologise\
  \ for not listening and Giorgia smiles with understanding. She knows what it feels\
  \ like. Maurizio smiles at us and asks hesitatingly, \u201CGood?\u201D I look at\
  \ him and say, \u201CBellissimo!\u201D He responds with, \u201CGrazie mille\u201D\
  \ and I see the pride in his eyes. Like a parent whose child has just been praised.\n\
  \nMaurizio then says something in very quick Italian to one of his chefs and Giorgia\
  \ says, \u201CYou will now try something which is very famous in this shop!\u201D\
  \ Her eyes dancing like little grey stars, she tells me that Do di petto\xAE was\
  \ created over thirty years ago while thinking about a famous Italian Opera singer,\
  \ Katia Ricciarelli. I am given a golden shortcrust pie, topped with toasted pine\
  \ nuts and filled with a chocolate mousse that hides a heart of custard. Maurizio\
  \ tells us the secret of the crust is 700 grams of butter in 1,000 grams of flour.\
  \ I don\u2019t hesitate and devour the pastry with great gusto. The toasted pine\
  \ nut complements the creamy chocolate mousse, and the buttery texture of the pastry\
  \ is like nothing else!\n\nGiorgia then tells Maurizio that I was a pastry chef\
  \ in India, and I see his eyes light up. He asks if I would enjoy seeing the kitchen?\
  \ I say yes instantly, and we walk around the back of the display counter into the\
  \ heart of the shop. Maurizio explains things to Giorgia who translates for me.\
  \ He watches me, to see my reaction and waits patiently as my response is translated\
  \ for him. He wants to know about Indian desserts, and I show him photographs and\
  \ videos from my Instagram account. Maurizio whips out his phone and says, \u201C\
  I follow, okay?\u201D And just like that there is no language barrier anymore! We\
  \ then take a photograph together because I want to remember this day forever.\n\
  \nWe step out of the shop, and I no longer feel the cold. In fact, I relish the\
  \ cold dry air whipping across my face, ready for my next destination."
