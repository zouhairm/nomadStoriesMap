Text: 'The bicycle darts on the earth, the wheels magnetize the viscous soil. A small
  opening of light is not seen to the horizon. My balance holds up itself on the hope.

  To enter the black forest without provisions has been an idea adventuress and pretty
  risky.

  The chimera of the fear is not to stop to look me back. The sky confuses and mix
  it among the trees. The misty colors are evanescents. The disconnected road is like
  a slackline. Nothing down.

  For the first time, the reasons of my mind are the same of the heart. The landscape
  resembles even more to a deprived labyrinth of dimensions.

  I look for hopelessly comfort in the silence of the leaves, a truce to the internal
  tumult.

  While the branches carpet seems a ready tongue of ground to swallow me more and
  more, I perceive a hidden clearing: a tunnel in descent, in the sharp pain ramification
  that composes it.

  I turn and I cross it in dive-bombing rapid. Aware that a tiny life can contain
  a great ideal, the pleasure of discovery. Minutes of apnea, then the sudden shine.

  I squeeze the brakes, the back wheel massacres the soil. In front of me the imaginary
  eden you would hold. The place that frees me from the obscurity.

  A primitive sunset fills me the eyes and the soul.

  Now that the sight get lost in the immense one, throw the bike as an unsheathed
  sword, lie down me to the ground as defeated. Yes, but this time from the uncontrolled
  and amazing happiness.

  The path through the glory is over.'
