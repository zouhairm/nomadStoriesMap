Text: "\"Why Bangladesh? What is wrong with you? No one goes there to travel. It's\
  \ a poor country!\" \n\nWhen you have lived with someone long enough, you know how\
  \ they will react to a situation and you can conjure up their words. These would\
  \ have been my Moms\u2019 while she balked at the idea of my going to Bangladesh\
  \ for tourism. This is exactly why I wrote in a hurried abstract to attend a conference\
  \ in Dhaka. As predicted, the mere mention of a conference did not draw any response\
  \ of the kind and I breathed a sigh of relief. \n\nWith that out of the way and\
  \ the abstract accepted, I was excited for my new adventure. The only thing I had\
  \ heard about this country was its poverty summed up by a local phrase \"Bangladesh\
  \ ke bhukkad (the hungry people of Bangladesh)\". Not wanting to bias my opinion\
  \ with anyone's theories or conjectures, I decided not to read about the country\
  \ or talk to anyone who might have traveled there.\n\nThe day I landed in Dhaka,\
  \ I came face to face with a reality I hadn't realized until then. I looked like\
  \ them. They looked like me. In order to take an auto from the airport, I walked\
  \ in the direction of the auto stand. The offers for rides came flying past in Bengali\
  \ while I, bewildered, overwhelmed, tried to comprehend their words relying on the\
  \ meager similarity their language shared with my native Hindi. However, the look\
  \ on my face didn't go unnoticed and they soon realized I was not one of their own.\
  \ The offered rates saw an immediate hike, the expressions shifted to curiosity.\
  \ \n\nI finally made my way into the city after battling the traffic for 2 hours\
  \ while my host worried if I had gotten lost. Next day I walked into the Dhaka University\
  \ all geared up for the conference. From the registration desk to the snack counter,\
  \ everywhere I was inundated with Bengali until my perplexed look was registered\
  \ and I was asked, \"Indian?\" My affirmation immediately drew huge smiles. No sooner\
  \ had I said it that the word swept around the students and they jostled to meet\
  \ me, shake my hand, take a picture with me, and add me on Facebook. For a moment\
  \ I had no idea what was going on. I was a normal person. Why was I being treated\
  \ like a celebrity? Discussions of Bollywood floated around and participants vied\
  \ for my attention. I had never felt more popular in my entire life. \n\nMy celebrity\
  \ status continued throughout the conference. I was shown around the city, introduced\
  \ to 'fuchkas', Bangladeshi version of Kolkata\u2019s 'puchkas' and Delhi\u2019\
  s 'golgappe' which I fell in love with to the extent of having them for breakfast.\
  \ \n\nA visit to the National Museum next day gave me an inside view of the history\
  \ behind Bangladesh and its horrifying separation from India and Pakistan. I got\
  \ to know about the hundreds of lives lost in their struggle to continue to speak\
  \ in their language Bangla. I remember walking out of the museum in tears. I wished\
  \ that day that I could speak Bangla. This was the first country which wasn't mine\
  \ yet it accepted me as its own. I belonged here. Until I opened my mouth, I was\
  \ one of them. I had never felt a feeling of belongingness anywhere else in the\
  \ world outside of my country. We were one. We always had been. Wars had separated\
  \ us but everything from our skin color to our clothing to even language which several\
  \ states of India speak in, were the same. Why then were we divided by a border?\
  \ What purpose did it serve? These people did not get the same opportunities we\
  \ had. They had to start from scratch building their own economy while we their\
  \ brothers and sisters had a better chance of education and employment. They did\
  \ not choose where they would be born, neither did we. But the disparity continues.\
  \ \n\nI came to Bangladesh without an opinion. However, of all the things I could\
  \ have thought of, I didn\u2019t expect to find home. But I had found one. In a\
  \ foreign land."
