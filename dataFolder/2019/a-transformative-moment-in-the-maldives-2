Text: "It\u2019s well past daybreak when we land at Ibrahim Nasir, Mal\xE9\u2019s\
  \ International airport on Hulhul\xE9 Island by way of Dubai.  The terminal is the\
  \ central transfer station for tourists arriving in the Republic of Maldives.  From\
  \ here visitors travel by speedboat or seaplane to one of the 100 or so luxury resorts\
  \ propped up on stilts jutting out over coral islands scattered throughout the nearly\
  \ 3,000 square kilometres of the Indian Ocean archipelago. \n\nWe\u2019re almost\
  \ 14,000 kilometres away from home, and after a quick check on my iPhone, I realize\
  \ it\u2019s still yesterday in Toronto.  Somehow my husband and I have managed to\
  \ survive 25 years of marriage, endless sleepless nights worrying about how we'll\
  \ pay our mortgage, to eventually growing a family and business together.  What\
  \ we\u2019ve endured over the last quarter century has brought us to this point\
  \ in our lives, to this paradise, were we can finally exhale and celebrate all that\
  \ we\u2019ve accomplished as a couple.\n\nA young man with a slim build and a gentle\
  \ manner, a representative from Coco Bodu Hithi Resort, greets us in the airport\u2019\
  s Transfer Hall and guides us across the promenade connecting the terminal to Mal\xE9\
  \ Harbour.  One of the resort\u2019s speedboats, with a hull the colour of a yellow\
  \ Tang fish and an iridescent pearl roof, is tethered to the dock and waits our\
  \ arrival on board.  But before we begin the next segment of our journey, a crewman\
  \ hands us each a white tightly rolled moist hand towel so we can refresh ourselves,\
  \ and then hands us each a bottle of chilled water.  Once we settle into the white\
  \ leather Captain Chairs overlooking the bow of the boat, and our luggage is safely\
  \ stowed in the hold, the helmsman steers his vessel through the harbour and out\
  \ into the open saltwater of the Indian Ocean. \n\nCoco Bodu Hithi is located on\
  \ North Mal\xE9 Atoll, a 30-minute speedboat ride north of Mal\xE9, the capital\
  \ city of the Republic.  The searing heat reminds us we\u2019re only a few hundred\
  \ kilometres north of the equator.  From the air the distinction between the indigo\
  \ and emerald water that swaths the atolls, ring-shaped coral reefs, is distinguishable,\
  \ but skimming along the surface, the colours kaleidoscope together.\n\nFor a nation\
  \ defined by its water rather than its land, it\u2019s not surprising that the fisheries\
  \ industry and marine products are the principal trades and contributors to the\
  \ Gross Domestic Product, but despite being self-sufficient, the Republic was identified\
  \ in the 1970s as one of the poorest countries in the world.  It wasn\u2019t until\
  \ later in the decade and into the \u201880s that the tourism industry began to\
  \ expand and make a significant impact on the country\u2019s economic growth, which\
  \ was driven by government reform.  At an average ground level elevation of 1.5\
  \ metres above the sea, a little less than five feet, the Maldives is the lowest-lying\
  \ country in the world, which makes it the most vulnerable to climate change.  Scientific\
  \ estimates vary, but without question, rising waters caused by climate change will\
  \ swallow all or most of this stunning nation before the end of the century.  As\
  \ I begin to make a local connection, I reflect on the carbon footprint I created\
  \ to get to where I am today, speeding over fragile coral reefs teeming with marine\
  \ life that makes this one of the richest bio-diversified places that exist on our\
  \ planet.  While the Maldives isn\u2019t an easy place to reach or an inexpensive\
  \ place to stay, its tourism industry is thriving.  Ironically, the government\u2019\
  s promotion of human expansion into their part of the world is contributing to climate\
  \ change.  \n\nAs our resort appears on the horizon, the helmsman slows his craft.\
  \  The water is still, and the full splendour of this extraordinary place unfolds\
  \ before us.  The equatorial sun climbs higher into the sky, and I make a vow not\
  \ to take any of what I encounter in this enchanted sliver of the world for granted.\
  \  I am embarking on a journey that is life changing, and realize making a local\
  \ connection to a global issue is a transformative moment for me."
