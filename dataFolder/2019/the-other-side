Text: "When I got to Mexico in December of 2017 I thought I was there just for fun\
  \ and shallow learning, had really no idea of what to expect, besides get totally\
  \ nuts. Went to places ate a lot of local food( with extra pepper, please) and party\
  \ night and day before the youth course starts. So, a beautiful day I woke up a\
  \ little queasy. Did not know well what was passing but, then I started to throw\
  \ up so hard that I almost lost my brain by the nose.\nImmediately I went with my\
  \ host family to a doctor. His methods were a little obsolete he had a typewriter\
  \ on his room and the place seemed stucked on the seventies but, a few days later\
  \ I was not feeling better. The program I was waiting for began and I felt sick\
  \ again, visited other doctors yet were accumulating other diseases. By the end\
  \ of the day got a cry crisis and could not breath either.\nThe group was too kind\
  \ and they decided to make a local ritual that the ancestors taught to the next\
  \ generations which was wonderful to see. An indigenous girl called Bel\xE9n caught\
  \ a pine from deep of her bag, the accommodation had some candles they grab with\
  \ salt and made a star. The people intoned a pray holding each other\u2019s hand,\
  \ blowing up from their mouth a powder made with some Amazonia\u2019s herbs.\nAfter\
  \ all, they hold me and said some words that I barely remind the sounds because\
  \ it was a native language, might sounds crazy but I felt light and energized at\
  \ the same time due to their faith. After that day I learned to put so much more\
  \ value on other\u2019s people knowledge because I am a testimony that not only\
  \ rational creed counts but the esoteric do too so, let\u2019s give them their value."
