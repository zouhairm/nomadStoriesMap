Text: "New year. New me, was my choice for 2018.\nBeing a solo traveler is not always\
  \ fun for most of us. To me, It was the beginning of the adventure. \nI always travel\
  \ with my friends, sometimes I do not like their choices but I want someone to accompany\
  \ me. \nThis year I traveled differently and left my comfort zone.\nThe first day,\
  \ I decided to not book a fancy hotel to stay in but to couch-surf with a local\
  \ man who gave a whole new conception of locals' life. Meeting a group of 30 people\
  \ in Madrid to spend the new year was the last thing I expected me to do. 10 days\
  \ in Madrid opened my mind to more than 15 culture of different countries of people\
  \ that I just meet. Also saved money, free accommodation, and dinner sharing. \n\
  I tried the 12 grapes of luck. Eating 12 grapes at midnight on New Year\u2019s Eve\
  \ is a tradition in Spain. One grape for each stroke of midnight could change your\
  \ year to have 12 months of luck. The tradition consists of eating a grape with\
  \ each bell strike at midnight on December 31.\nI cannot lie that I was afraid of\
  \ chocking, as everyone focuses on eating all 12 grapes of luck, I was focusing\
  \ on, not to chock and die away and alone.\nI made friends from all over the world\
  \ that day. I felt lucky \"maybe because of the grapes\", where my year started\
  \ to be more fun and clear to me.\nwho would imagine that in some countries the\
  \ typical breakfast could be chocolate, Spanish breakfast is a dream came true where\
  \ the famous churros con chocolate in the chocolateria San Gines in Madrid is perfect\
  \ for chocolate's lovers. \nGran Via street in Madrid was a great place to spend\
  \ the day in, but I learned from locals that never eat in a touristic place because\
  \ food will never be good. So searching for restaurants in small corners to taste\
  \ the traditional Tapas, Jamon or tortilla was a challenge.\nAfter leaving Madrid,\
  \ I realized that I had never experienced the real fun in each country I have visited\
  \ before. I started to travel solo, meet locals, and try to discover the hidden\
  \ gems of any country I go to.\nI have been to Thailand several times before. Never\
  \ thought that I will come back as new me and find something different waiting for\
  \ me. Before 2018, I used to visit the touristic places, eat expensive food,  meet\
  \ no locals because I already have someone with me, and spend money I mean a lot\
  \ of money.\nI used to travel two times a year. \nIn 2018, I traveled to 8 different\
  \ countries because I saved a lot of money that I was wasting. \nI met local this\
  \ time in Thailand, they showed me unique places that tourists not usually reach.\
  \ The Wat Sampran Dragon Temple, 1 hour far from Bangkok, 17-stories high and wrapped\
  \ with huge dragon all over the building. I was the only person in that place, I\
  \ entered the temple and you get to go up through a tunnel inside the body of the\
  \ dragon. If you have never been to Khoa Yai park, you missed the beauty of nature,\
  \ wild animals, waterfalls, hobbit houses, Greece and Italy villages, and the amazing\
  \ sunflower field spending 3 hours to reach there was totally worth it."
