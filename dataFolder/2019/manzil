Text: Manzil is which i didn't expect to find but is always on search of it .. walking
  across miles or driving across rivers thought i would get this manzil of mine which
  is so far from me even in my dreams.. but to be honest never got their ....dreams
  do come in night only if we are not awake all night and  maybe the cause we cant
  make things all right .... soul searching is something which leads us to different
  places but this life and its formalities or do's and don'ts dont let us reach our
  manzil....   but than one day when 4friends from college decides to go on a trip
  of most famous place in country the place is so divine that people from the world  comes  their
  and resides there yes that place was rishikesh were you will find holy ganga and
  ghats and the famous yoga city and the calm we get their  in the shore of ganga
  and chaos from temples wowww that was something which took my heart away ..... small
  street cafes near the river and that soft music and evening and aonetimes started
  raining owww wowww that was something which i wanted to never stop... being single
  is best when you are on a trip and definitely soul searching in your mind.. your
  best friends are the biggest strength you have and when yku reach places like rishikesh
  you feel out of the world as you will wind people from all religion their musing
  in the music of sufi and yep maybe boozing too most probably in peace and high on
  the noise of the streets Nd khan khan from the temples the noise of bells and that
  ganga arti near the holy ganga... yes that's where you get  your peace of mind to
  be honest.
