Text: In March of 2016, I first went to Lisbon, Portugal to meet my soulmate. We met
  through a friend on FB, talked everyday. I finally decided we should meet... He
  took a 3 Hour bus ride from the Algarve to meet me at the airport. We happened to
  click immediately, he was very charming. We spent 11 days together, and I kept going
  after few months to visit. I absolutely fell in love with Portugal and continue
  to keep going back as there is so much to learn. I fell in love with the rich history,
  the people were amazing, and I even picked up some of the language. They have the
  best port wines, pastries, and of course the sardines.. I find that they are so
  rich in culture, actually take the time out to enjoy a cup of coffee.. I also fell
  in love with the buildings and castles. They have the best shopping, great food,
  and friendly people.. I would love to move there. I think I would enjoy writing
  a travel blog about my experience. I could envision truly being happy there... Life
  seems to be beautiful there... I would really enjoy this experience.. I would love
  to go back and explore Portugal. Thank you for your time..
