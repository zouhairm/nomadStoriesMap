Text: "\u2018Ticket please\u2019, a woman with an exhausted look and a heavy accent\
  \ approached me with her right hand stretched out. I just finished climbing down\
  \ a flight of stairs to a metro station in Budapest, excited about completing my\
  \ first solo trip in Europe. Budapest was my last stop before flying back home and\
  \ I was heading to the airport. \n\nWondering why she is not wearing a uniform,\
  \ I took out the ticket I purchased moments earlier and placed it in her hand. \u2018\
  It\u2019s not validated, you have to pay a fine \u2013 8,000 forint\u2019, she spoke\
  \ in an angry tone after a few seconds look at the ticket. Explaining that I tried\
  \ to validate it but couldn\u2019t and that I am a tourist who entered the country\
  \ the night before only landed me in hot waters. Then came the ultimatum, either\
  \ I had to pay or risk being jailed. I looked at my watch, the next train to the\
  \ airport was leaving in a few minutes. I couldn\u2019t believe what my last day\
  \ in Europe was turning out to be. \u2018Policia\u2019, the ticket controller started\
  \ speaking into a radio in Hungarian and that was the only word I could make out.\
  \ \n\nA guilt-ridden voice started tugging on my sleeves. I was on the verge of\
  \ paying the fine as a tall guy with spectacles carrying a backpack approached us.\
  \ I felt a bout of uncertainty as the two went on exchanging words in Hungarian.\
  \ Although I could not understand what they were saying, the change in her expression\
  \ a few seconds into the conversation made me believe things were going in the right\
  \ direction. \u2018Okay, okay\u2019, said the woman as she handed me back my ticket.\
  \ Caught between curiosity of what made her change her mind but still pressed for\
  \ time, I saw him start walking away. Clasping my hands in front of my chest, I\
  \ said, \u201CThank you\u201D. He gave me a smile \u2013 one that I would never\
  \ forget, if I ever forget everything I had seen in Budapest. I took comfort in\
  \ knowing that no matter how far I could be from home, there are souls that stand\
  \ by me and lift my spirits. \n\nI rushed to the airport and approached the check-in\
  \ counter gasping for air. \u2018Ticket please\u2019, the unpleasant ordeal earlier\
  \ flashed through my mind. In utter disbelief, I heard the man on the counter explain\
  \ the plane is overbooked and they are looking for volunteers who can take the flight\
  \ the next day. I couldn\u2019t overstay my visa. A few minutes later, my name was\
  \ called out. A woman walked up to me, handed me a boarding pass and said I was\
  \ upgraded to business class, as if going back home is not enough of a reward. \
  \ I finally sat back in the airplane with a nice meal, my favorite show and the\
  \ perfect companion \u2013 the thought of a kind stranger."
