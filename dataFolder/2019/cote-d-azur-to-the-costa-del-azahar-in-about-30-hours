Text: "A thrilling summer getaway? Yeah, I remember some of those, great memories\
  \ all of them. Whether am I particularly fond of any is something yet to decide,\
  \ although there\u2019s one whose ingredients make it fun to tell. A map, a train\
  \ pass, an entrance for a lifetime waited musical festival, no plan, a driver\u2019\
  s union strike, and about thirty hours to make it from the C\xF4te d'Azur to the\
  \ Costa del Azahar.\n\nThe whole trip started just East of the French Riviera. That\
  \ year the Benic\xE0ssim music festival had two of my top 3 favorite bands in its\
  \ lineup. Influenced by my \u201Cseize-the-moment\u201D attitude, I convinced myself\
  \ those nearly thousand kilometers weren\u2019t that much. \n\nI took the train\
  \ towards Marseille, and at the very last moment I made a stop in Nice. I just had\
  \ to go for a quick last swim at the C\xF4te d'Azur. Went back to the train, and\
  \ resumed my travel not having yet decided where to spend the night. Did I happen\
  \ to mention I had a map? Well, that\u2019s not unusual of me, but it\u2019s funny\
  \ to remember how, less than ten years ago, we used to travel with no mobile data\
  \ like nowadays. While looking through the windows at the as much iconic as mesmerizing\
  \ lavender fields, I checked on the map how far Avignon was, then I glanced at the\
  \ trains time table, and voil\xE0! I made up my mind. I was supposed to have some\
  \ free time to wander at Marseille\u2019s train station, but something changed in\
  \ the schedule. I check the trains, platforms, times, and I ended up rushing into\
  \ the line to get my pass converted into a ticket for my next trip. Time was running\
  \ out, last train to my destination was about to depart, and my only hope was an\
  \ extremely understanding and fast person at the ticket window. She looked at me,\
  \ then glanced at the clock, and she couldn\u2019t hide her astonishment. While\
  \ we were talking, I thought about the possibility to just stay in Marseille. No\
  \ need for that, she gave me the ticket, and a warm farewell like if we knew each\
  \ other from a long time. I ran to reach the platform, hop into the train a minute\
  \ before its departure.\n\nTime to enjoy the moon raising over Marseille through\
  \ the window train, while I promised myself to visit the port city one day. I took\
  \ a nap, and decided to relax, things were turning out well after all. At least\
  \ it lasted until I made it to Avignon. After arriving, someone asked me if I was\
  \ visiting to enjoy Festival d'Avignon. No, I surely wasn\u2019t planning on it.\
  \ There was I, not train back (or forth), no lodging reserved, and a city fully\
  \ booked. The town whose name is well known for being part of Picasso\u2019s most\
  \ famous works, was vibrant and festive that night, then I had no other choice than\
  \ walk the streets, eat, bar crawl, and search for a place to spend the night, all\
  \ while carrying my backpack. Finally, I found a room that served just fine to figure\
  \ out my next day itinerary. \n\nNext day I kept going to the Spanish border, changed\
  \ trains a couple of times, and arrived to Figueres, Dali\u2019s hometown, another\
  \ unexpected event. Clock kept ticking in the dusty train station, people were mumbling\
  \ about the strike, then someone told that the trains were going no further from\
  \ Barcelona. I would have to find a way to make it to Castell\xF3. After a big delay\
  \ I met one of my friends outside Sants. The festival had already started. We found\
  \ a buses company that was still running to Benic\xE0ssim. Once in town, we rushed\
  \ to the hostel, drop-off our bags, and ran through the streets to catch the local\
  \ transport to the festival venue. Breathless and tired, we reached the gig to meet\
  \ the rest. The crowd\u2019s excitement, the staging performance, the long time\
  \ wait to see them live, all added to the events from the past two days, contributed\
  \ grandly to the enjoyment that followed. Now, when I think of this dazzling trip,\
  \ I can\u2019t help to smile."
