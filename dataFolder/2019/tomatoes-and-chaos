Text: "\u201CCome on, get the ham already. It's a team effort, people!\u201D\n\nStanding\
  \ underneath a relentless morning sun, I began to feel antsy among my fellow La\
  \ Tomatina goers. We watched as a human pile formed at the base of a greased wooden\
  \ pole. Some merely drunk, others hungry for glory, each person attempted to scramble\
  \ up and grab a large and unappetizing chunk of ham at the top. As limbs and hands\
  \ flailed about, loud cheers erupted every time a chunk of thick lard was batted\
  \ away which meant someone had gained new heights by stepping viciously (and necessarily)\
  \ on the person below them.\n\nLila and I squeezed through the crowd to the truck\
  \ of whooping volunteers happily spraying people with a power hose. A young boy\
  \ stood with his mother from a high window shooting his water gun at the eager crowd\
  \ below. A giddy, elderly man snuck up behind unsuspecting victims to dump a bucket\
  \ of cold water over their heads (myself included), which I watched him fill repeatedly.\n\
  \nWe had stepped onto a lawless land.\n\nAs more arrivals funnelled into Bunol's\
  \ quaint and narrow streets, we got crammed more tightly together.\n\nI looked down\
  \ at my 5\u20190 partner-in-crime and we grinned at each other, looking silly with\
  \ goggles on our heads and phones inside plastic pouches hanging off our necks.\
  \ We bought the cases from one of the many locals selling merchandise outside of\
  \ the warzone.\n\nThe cold shock of the water spraying sporadically at the crowd\
  \ made us, along with the short woman beside us, grimace and laugh as we tried to\
  \ duck behind the taller participants.\n\nSuddenly, something hard hit me square\
  \ in the chest, leaving behind a mild sting. I looked down and saw a broken, mushy\
  \ ball.\n\n\"Oh my god, I just got hit! It\u2019s starting!\"\n\nThe reality of\
  \ La Tomatina 2018 set in immediately, just as the musky odour of warm moisture\
  \ and rotten vegetables assaulted my nose. We quickly slid on our goggles and closed\
  \ our gaping mouths as pieces of tomato splattered randomly across the crowd.\n\n\
  Multiple trucks filled with tomatoes inched their way down the street and bodies\
  \ crushed against them\u2014and us\u2014to get at the crimson ammo. I could hardly\
  \ breathe and I wondered briefly if crossing this world-renowned event off my bucket\
  \ list was really so important.\n\nMinutes later, the crowd loosened and I was able\
  \ to move my arms again. The fight began almost timidly, tomatoes being tossed rather\
  \ than thrown at each other. By the second round of trucks, however, we all became\
  \ bolder and I found myself scooping tomato slush from the ground and chucking it\
  \ across the crowd, not caring where it landed. At one point, a man smacked a pile\
  \ of crushed slop on top of my head and exclaimed a long, \"Aaay,\" like the Fonz.\n\
  \nIt was mayhem and I loved it. I revelled in it. I flung as many tomatoes as I\
  \ could get my hands on at complete strangers while being covered in a mixture of\
  \ dirt and juicy tomato bits. It felt surreal being in this swarm of 20,000 visitors\
  \ who were just as crazy as me for participating in this chaos.\n\n\"Betty! Someone\
  \ took my phone!\"\n\nI snapped out of my happy daze and looked down at Lila's panicked\
  \ face. Someone had ripped her phone from around her neck.\n\nAfter a failed attempt\
  \ to chase the culprit through the joyous red-soaked mob, Lila logged into my \"\
  Find My iPhone\" app and we ran to the Guardia Civil tent. Between my limited high\
  \ school level Spanish and superb charades skills, we got our story across before\
  \ an English-speaking officer arrived.\n\nSeveral officers dressed in plainclothes\
  \ borrowed my phone to tail the GPS that marked the thief\u2019s location. After\
  \ about what felt like an hour, they returned with Lila's phone and our day was\
  \ salvaged.\n\nOn the return train from Bunol to Valencia, we sat silently on the\
  \ floor, exhausted. Looking at my fellow La Tomatina passengers, I felt an overwhelming\
  \ sense of camaraderie and appreciation for the chance to be here.\n\nHappy birthday\
  \ to me, I thought as I fell asleep."
