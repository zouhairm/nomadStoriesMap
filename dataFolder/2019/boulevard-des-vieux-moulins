Text: "She wants to be a sage-femme. \n\nThe conversation crumbles between us like\
  \ the rocks beneath my sandals. They are not equipped for climbing to the windmill,\
  \ nor am I equipped with more than a hesitant grasp of her language. \n\nWords spill\
  \ amongst the murmuring of the crickets; the sun is setting above Nissan-lez-Enserune,\
  \ and they sing in force as we stumble among the white rocks and weeds of the fitness\
  \ trail. \n\nShe\u2019d kept her word, and taken me into the hills overlooking the\
  \ Languedoc countryside. She climbs the paths effortlessly, dark hair swinging behind\
  \ the bandana I gave her. She reminds me of a deer - gentle, fragile, wide-eyed\
  \ innocence \u2013 but her earnestness about becoming a midwife is profound, and\
  \ I find my words slipping away in admiration. \n\nWe continue upwards, following\
  \ the fitness trail once placed in these hills. Nature had disagreed: tendrils of\
  \ wildflowers and nettles circle the monkey bars, threatening to snag our feet as\
  \ our hands tingle against the rust. The trail has been abandoned \u2013 despite\
  \ the orderly vineyards in the valley below, the chaotic growth of thyme and lavender\
  \ beneath us whispers that nature will always reign. \n\nEarlier, I rode the H\xE9\
  rault bus as a chariot back from B\xE9ziers: I was the sole passenger, and watched\
  \ in sticky, sweat-driven fear as the driver swung through the narrow provincial\
  \ streets, skipping all the stops until mine, grimacing at the blazing heat. \n\n\
  We were all surprised by the heat: a burning tidal-wave that makes me long for air-conditioning,\
  \ or a sharp taste of winter\u2019s breath. None of this dry-lipped, shallow-breathed\
  \ aridity. \n\nWe stop to do sit-ups, on a moss-covered plank of wood gently sheltered\
  \ by the drowsy sun. We work in rhythm, rocking backwards and forwards. She tells\
  \ me, not even missing a breath, about her passion for gymnastics, her plans for\
  \ coll\xE8ge. I labour on, still tasting the brioche and Nutella from this afternoon\u2019\
  s go\xFBter, watching as she runs her fingers through the nearest plant. To me,\
  \ it is nothing more than a plant causing an irritating scratch, to accompany the\
  \ agonising pain of my mosquito bites. For her, the plant represents a gift: an\
  \ opportunity to show her grandmother how much she loves her. \n\nShe rubs a stem\
  \ of thyme between her thumb and index finger, snapping it decisively. We\u2019\
  ll later take it back to the village, discarding the freedom of nature for the present,\
  \ chatting with her brother about his broken foot, rap music thumping in the background.\
  \ \n\nBut for now \u2013 now, in this moment almost suspended in time \u2013 she\
  \ tucks the thyme into her bandana, and motions for me to follow her to the hill\u2019\
  s edge. \nI inhale, unable to speak. No words \u2013 not in her language, not in\
  \ mine \u2013 can describe the beauty of the open landscape. It\u2019s not that\
  \ remarkable \u2013 no gleaming rivers or futuristic skyscrapers or architectural\
  \ wonders to gaze at. Just fields, running towards the horizon, with the rosy glow\
  \ of the sunset caressing their edges. \n\nRising on the hill opposite is the Oppidum\
  \ d\u2019Ens\xE9rune, a Gallo-Roman settlement occupied from the 6th century BC.\
  \ Its weather-beaten eye stretches across the valley, where we blend into a millennium\
  \ of human civilisation. The beauty of these fields may not be remarkable, but they\
  \ possess a tranquillity acquired from a thousand years of stasis. Behind the Oppidum,\
  \ the sun gazes upon its reflection in the Etang de Montady, a lake drained in the\
  \ 13th century. The fields stretch as sun rays, with the water draining towards\
  \ the centre in a feat of medieval engineering indescribable today. \n\nShe wants\
  \ to continue to the moulins, but I linger, knowing that with my broken phone, my\
  \ memory is the only camera I have. The sun grazes upon the top of the hill, resting\
  \ its head upon the same fields that will remain for eternity. I see her check the\
  \ time on her phone, and suddenly she melts into a small silhouette, adjusting her\
  \ bandana with one hand. Here, I am at the boundary between the past and the future,\
  \ and it makes me smile.\n \nShe wants to be a sage-femme, but I think she\u2019\
  s already there. \n\nOnly a wise woman could bring me here."
