Text: "My journey starts at a Small and Medium Enterprise conference in Nairobi. This\
  \ is where I met  Galgayo Guyo whom in our chat mentioned that he came from North\
  \ Horr, Marsabit Kenya. I knew there was a Solar eclipse that had been advertised\
  \ in the media and the precise location to be seen clearly was Sibiloi National\
  \ park at the shores of Lake Turkana.\"I would like to visit North Horr one day\"\
  \ I told Guyo. We exchange phone numbers and that was it.\nMy phone rang at about\
  \ 3 pm on a Monday a month after meeting Mr. Guyo. The phone call was from Guyo\
  \ and that he was in Nairobi loading items into a lorry for their wholesale shop\
  \ in North Horr. \"Would you like to come\" responded Mr. Guyo. I love traveling\
  \ and that was what I was waiting for because it was coinciding with the solar eclipse.\
  \ I immediately parked my travel bag.\nThe journey started at 10 pm on the same\
  \ day, we sat in front of the lorry together with the driver for the long journey\
  \ ahead. The journey took us through the beautiful scenery of the northern part\
  \ of Kenya. We arrived in Marsabit the following day at 5 pm. We had to wait for\
  \ the nightfall so that we can cross the unforgiving Chalbi desert. Chalbi desert\
  \ is very hot that if we could cross during the day the tires will burst. We left\
  \ Marsabit at 9 pm and arrived at North Horr at 4 am, 30 hours after leaving Nairobi\
  \ we were finally to this place I longed to see.\nA week later after enjoying the\
  \ local food and camel milk, we left another 6-hour journey to Sibiloi National\
  \ park. The following day was the Solar eclipse event and many tourists were around.\
  \ Many cultural activities were pitched by the county government for our enjoyment.\
  \ \nI am so grateful to Mr. Guyo for his hospitality and the fact that I had the\
  \ courage to leap into the unknown."
