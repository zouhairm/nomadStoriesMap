Text: "It was a very fine morning I decided to leave my home for a few days, being\
  \ an Indian more over being a girl I want to do this thing secretly, For avoiding\
  \ unessasary drama  i told my parents that I am going back to my college where I\
  \ am teaching. Being a grown up women I escaped without any doubt. \nGreat confusion\
  \ was where to go, then I saw a bus named Thiruvanathapuram ( district in Kerala)\
  \ I got into the bus and I suddenly grab a side seat and started to hear my favorite\
  \ songs of Vijay( actor of Tamil nadu) who has got a lot of songs which tempts us\
  \ to dance even in public. Moving to my intentions to start this journey was quite\
  \ natural every girl wants to travel alone, most of the cases nobody allows her\
  \ to go out with out body gards named brother, mother,  father bla bla bla...\n\
  The road was too heavy lot of people, vehicle, more scooters and bike, to the people\
  \ who don't know about kerala the women's here are so educated and they are self\
  \ sufficient you never can see such lady drivers in any other country. Because of\
  \ the heavy pollution I closed the window then I realise some one is next to me.\
  \ A small glimpse of smile comes to my face, being an unmarried women and not in\
  \ a relationship to any one because of the wired characters of mine no one can adjust\
  \ me so I am happy that a handsome young man is near to me. While me looking  to\
  \ his face, driver sudden breaked the bus and that result a inflammation in my head.\
  \ while he treating me like a patient I asked him that are you a Doctor and he replied\
  \ No, after a breath he said I will become after one year. lot of people are leaving\
  \ boarding so many things happening and he is explaining about the beauty of kerala\
  \ being a Hindi speaking guy he enjoys a lot in my place, The back waters in Alappuzha,\
  \  the stunning beach the greenery and the food, little spicy any way people can\
  \ eat. \nAfter talking to him all his problems seems to be so fragile to me then\
  \ suddenly Teacher in me wake up, he is also escaped from his home. Suddenly I console\
  \ him and bring him back to my home and then I called his parents and discussed\
  \ everything. Talk openly to every one.\nI found my self as a responsible adult.\n\
  Sorry I didn't travelled much. if I get a chance I loved to....."
