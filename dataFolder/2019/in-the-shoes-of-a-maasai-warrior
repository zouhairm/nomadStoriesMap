Text: "Around 7 pm as I walked towards the hotel gate, the bicycle-taxi arrived as\
  \ planned. Right on time! He brought me to the Maasai woman in the village that\
  \ was making my Maasai-jewelry and waited with me as one of the beaded rings the\
  \ woman made me was too tight and had to be remade, it took much longer. In the\
  \ meanwhile it got really dark outside and she couldn\u2019t get the thread through\
  \ the needle eye, so the whole Maasai family on site had tried to help. Also I thought:\
  \ oh well, I'll just do that, but turn out; the needle eye was so small that even\
  \ I didn\u2019t succeed. One of the Maasai guys borrowed my glasses and claimed\
  \ that he could see through them, but he still couldn\u2019t managed to get the\
  \ thread through the needle eye. Eventually the Maasai woman ran in to a bar - in\
  \ the light - and managed.\n\nThe Maasai tribe outside multiplied. They were very\
  \ friendly, came and talk to me and introduced themselves one by one. They were\
  \ also curios who am I, where I came from, how come we have the same skin color,\
  \ how is life in Europe etc. They found me very interesting. I complimented one\
  \ of the Maasai guys on his shoes, made out of old car tires, so he told me I should\
  \ try it on. I didn\u2019t want to, but he insisted, so I did. I put on his shoes,\
  \ start jumping as high as I could, and shouted: I\u2019m a Maasai! I\u2019m a Maasai!\
  \ They all started laughing. Then one of the other Maasai guys gave me his weapon,\
  \ made of cow bones and metal spikes and said: Here! Take this with you! We joked\
  \ around, and then I gave them back their shoes and weapon.\nIn the meantime I had\
  \ to fit my ring and we talked further. I told them about me, my culture, my travels\
  \ and life in Europe and they told me about their culture and habits. I felt very\
  \ at ease and felt connected to the Maasai group. We had so much fun together, that\
  \ I felt connected. They treated me as if I was part of their family although we\u2019\
  ve first met. One of the Maasai guys even threw a necklace made of a shark tooth,\
  \ rope and beads, around my neck and said: \u201Cthis is for you, that you will\
  \ never forget me!\u201D\n\nMoments later my beaded Maasai ring was finally ready.\
  \ As it was very late and pitch-dark on the streets, the Maasai group had offered\
  \ to escort me back to my hotel for safety reasons. All of them. A group of about\
  \ thirty armed Maasai warriors. They wanted to make sure I arrive to my hotel safely.\
  \ I thought that was very sweet of them, but I said no, I\u2019ll be okay, that\u2019\
  s why I brought my bicycle-taxi. They insisted to walk me to the hotel still, and\
  \ I agreed. Once we\u2019ve got to the hotel gate, they hug me goodbye one by one,\
  \ and asked me if I will come back again soon as I was leaving Kenya the next morning.\
  \ Saying goodbye and paying my bicycle-taxi for the day, even he said: wow, they\
  \ really like you! They all waved at me as I was entering the hotel gate. As a woman\
  \ travelling alone, I have never felt safer in a foreigner country at nighttime,\
  \ being with locals I don\u2019t really know. It was a great experience I will never\
  \ forget."
