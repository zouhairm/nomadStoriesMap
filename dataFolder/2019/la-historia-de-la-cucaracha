Text: "Travelling on the collectivo #44, Belgrado to Caballito, I take a seat in the\
  \ 4 seat section of the bus. Two older ladies sitting across from me, spot a baby\
  \ cockroach on the window, immediately tension erupts. An emotional conversation\
  \ sparks between the two strangers, emitting disgust and slight fear. One lady scurries\
  \ through her bag, she is looking for something to attack the little finger sized\
  \ creature, constantly throwing phobic glances at the location of the moving pest\
  \ as if it might pounce any moment. I feel myself become protective, ever since\
  \ reading Kafka\u2019s Metamorphosis I've struggled to see the roach as a nuisance.\
  \ I feel the passengers sense my thoughts about their thoughts preempting murder,\
  \ a line has ben drawn and in my mind I urge the ancient evolved pest onwards and\
  \ upwards, free from danger.\n\nOne of the older ladies rises and approaches the\
  \ driver, filling his attention with her unease. He simply shrugs his shoulders,\
  \ I assume he is thinking \u2018lady this is a city we live in\u2019 she raises\
  \ her voice \u2018escucha mi/hear me\u2019 the force of her jitters penetrate the\
  \ bus and now we are all involved. One tiny creature that is capable of living up\
  \ to a week without its head, has united a bus full of strangers to collectively\
  \ lose their heads! \n\nPassengers abandon their travels, and swap seats. Finally\
  \ the small creature takes a courageous breath, cockroaches can hold their breath\
  \ for up to 40 minutes so for sure its a big one, and leaps! Landing on a ladies\
  \ hair, people sound alarms, flinch, fearing for their life! The lucky lady laughs,\
  \ what more can she do, an older lady sitting in front of me shakes her head and\
  \ turns to me with an eyebrow raised and declares \u2018la historia de el cucaracha!\u2019"
