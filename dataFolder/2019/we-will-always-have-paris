Text: "To love and to hate. Downstairs of Sacr\xE9 Coeur and for the first time in\
  \ a really really short life time I find myself lost and found. The person I use\
  \ to love the most just told the magic words to break my whole body and most important\
  \ my state of mind. \u201C I am a very frustrated woman\u201D, she said. And then\
  \ maybe because of that giant kind of building so sacred and pure we felt like tiny\
  \ ants trying to win this battle that had formed long ago. For a moment, time stopped,\
  \ it was just both of us and the tourists were in pause. It was winter, it was the\
  \ very last day of the trip, maybe it was that after a whole week without a chance\
  \ to see the sun we were just too tired to pretend anymore. After trying to catch\
  \ the face of the Mona Lisa or trying to get a seat in Cafe Flore, probably was\
  \ just too much for one week. The whole mother-daughter role was broke. I was there\
  \ hearing a person just telling me I have no future. But after all,  that\u2019\
  s the kind of magic I was for sure not expecting, I mean, the \u201Ccity of love\u201D\
  \ you know? Althought, I am very grateful for it. Now I now that my mother and I\
  \ we allways have Paris, where we discovered the things we needed to say. It was\
  \ the first time I felt love and hate at the same time, I felt like I was nothing\
  \ but also I felt powerfull because I just have told my mother the thruth in such\
  \ a unique place and who does that? For sure and even If I am not a religious person,\
  \ I won\u2019t forget Paris but specially I wonder how it would be to go back to\
  \ Sacr\xE9 Coeur. Maybe that place it is so wonderful that takes the best and the\
  \ worst out of you.  After this exact moment we just kept going, it was time to\
  \ go and see some Basquiat art work, how amazing was that? To see some disruptive\
  \ dialogue of some genius mind like Jean Michel\u2019s one  sounds  like good therapy\
  \ for me. Next day I was in Mexico and like she know best she just pretended like\
  \ nothing happened... for me everyhting happened, thank you Paris."
