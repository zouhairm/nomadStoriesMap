Text: "\"Dave, I can feel its testicles on my neck\". Its a phrase I probably never\
  \ want to hear my wife say ever again.\n \nAs we entered Mandala Suci Wenara Wana\
  \ or more well known as Monkey Forest in Ubud, Bali, we knew what we were in for;\
  \ No loose items, don\u2019t look the monkeys in the eye. The usual warnings, Seems\
  \ Fair, after all there are some 750 monkeys there after all so a certain street\
  \ smart is needed, if sometimes lacking in some.\n \nIts a fantastically spiritual\
  \ and breathtaking place, sacred ruins nestle among lush greenery and ancient Banyan\
  \ trees swooping down to blend human temple with nature in a seamless dance.\n\n\
  As we sauntered round, trying to find that place, that quiet peaceful place, the\
  \ place you only wish you can find away from the throng, the place that seldom exists\
  \ in a tourist heavy world, I felt a pull at my arm, a tender but purposeful tug,\
  \ its my wife, Colette, She must want to show me something. Oh, She does, she seemed\
  \ to be sporting the latest fashion Trend around her neck.Teenage Male Monkey.\n\
  \ \nWhat do you do in those situations, were British at the end of the day so we\
  \ ignore it long enough until it goes away, that worked for generations.  After\
  \ 10 minutes, its clear it isn\u2019t going away, its settled, its comfortable,\
  \ its resting its tiny little monkey hands atop my wife\u2019s head like a pampered\
  \ princess awaiting a dance, or an episode.\n \nTheres now a gaggle of tourists\
  \ taking photos of us, my wife wearing a living accessory, me trying to not look\
  \ the thing in the eye whilst trying to move it on whilst also trying not to make\
  \ a scene. Its not working, at all, its like a comedy sketch but this monkey has\
  \ sharp teeth and im red faced with embarrassment and sweating more than I should\
  \ be in that climate, which is no laughing matter.\n \n\u201COk\u201D I say \u201C\
  lets end this tomfoolery\u201D said in my (unconvincing) faux-macho voice, chest\
  \ out, head up, more surface area is the key to dominance (ive probably not read\
  \ correctly somewhere, clearly), I step forward..i regret it immediatly \u201CErm,\
  \ Colette, I looked it in the eye\u201D.\n \n\u201CYou\u2019re a prize idiot\u201D\
  \ she returns, \u201Cyou can hardly talk, im not the one with a monkey on my neck\
  \ like an overdressed Edwardian Dandy\u201D is my only rebuttal, slowly backing\
  \ away from this monkey and its teeth to the titter of dozens of onlookers.\n \n\
  Do I leave her to it, Do I just walk off? As if on queue, an unassuming Frenchman\
  \ near us offers a banana and the headscarf monkey, and it seems, ALL the monkeys\
  \ descend on him, like a low budget remake of planet of the apes. \n \n\u201CViva\
  \ la france\u201D I mutter as we make our escape.\n \nI hope he\u2019s ok, the French\
  \ are a hardy bunch."
