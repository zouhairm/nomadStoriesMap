Text: "I\u2019ve never been as lost as I was in Casablanca. \n\nDetermined not to\
  \ pay for a taxi, I decided I would walk back to my hotel and explore on the way.\
  \ I had eight hours before my flight, plenty of time. \n\nMorocco\u2019s sunbaked\
  \ Kasbahs and teahouses had mesmerized me, but the constant unwanted attention,\
  \ from tour offerings to thinly veiled threats of violence, made me wary. I wasn\u2019\
  t hiding in my hotel room, but I wasn\u2019t talking to anyone I didn\u2019t need\
  \ to. \n\nCasablanca felt safer and more European. However, as I began walking I\
  \ realized I was still far from home. The street I was on turned into a weaving\
  \ path, barely wide enough to allow cars to pass. \n\nSeveral twists later it turned\
  \ sharply and traffic stopped at the entrance to a bustling food market. I was still\
  \ sure I was moving in the right direction, so I stopped to buy a pita stuffed with\
  \ something that seemed adventurous but not adventurous enough reseat me in the\
  \ plane\u2019s bathroom. \n\nI turned to leave, only to realize I wasn\u2019t sure\
  \ what direction I\u2019d come from. Eventually, I picked one, figuring if all else\
  \ failed I could find a taxi once I found a road not blocked by the market. I underestimated\
  \ the size of the market.  \n\nAfter wandering in a series of circles and frantic\
  \ zigzags, I stumbled onto a plaza and saw moving traffic. I checked the time, I\
  \ was definitely not walking back to the hotel but a taxi would be fine.\n\nHailing\
  \ a taxi in Casablanca proved to be another challenge. Most were full or driving\
  \ too quickly. The few that pulled up drove away when they realized I could only\
  \ give the hotel\u2019s name in English. \n\nHalf an hour later I was ready to throw\
  \ myself into traffic.  Thankfully, at this point, a woman walked up to me. She\
  \ was about my age and had pin straight black hair and next to me she looked quite\
  \ put together. \n\n\u201CYou look lost,\u201D she told me, bluntly, but in perfect\
  \ English. \n\nShe introduced herself as Amira, said she lived in Casablanca, and\
  \ offered to help me hail a taxi. \n\nI would have rejoiced at the help but Morocco\
  \ had made me nervous, most of the strangers I\u2019d met wanted something. I started\
  \ to tell her I was fine but paused as I looked at the time. I either needed help\
  \ or to accept losing the suitcase I\u2019d left at my hotel. \n\n\u201CNone one\
  \ understands where my hotel is,\u201D I explained, holding my phone tightly in\
  \ my hand as I showed her the map. I\u2019d heard of people having their phones\
  \ stolen by helpful strangers. \n\n\u201CThe address is in English, they can\u2019\
  t read it,\u201D she said.  \n\nShe pulled up a map on her phone and handed it to\
  \ me. My hotel flashed across the screen. We tried to hail a taxi, without any luck.\
  \ \n\nAmira told me not to worry; her cousin was a block away and could drive us.\
  \ I paused again, this sounded like the first five minutes of Taken. Then, another\
  \ full taxi went flying by me, and I decided this was the best of bad options. \n\
  \nMinutes later a red car arrived. Amira got in the passenger seat and I timidly\
  \ sat down in the back. As we drove I watched the city pass, planning a series of\
  \ quick escapes at traffic lights.\n\n Amira told me about her university and her\
  \ life in the city. She asked what I had seen in Morocco and gave me a list of places\
  \ to see when I came back. She told me I had to come back. \n\nHer cousin drove\
  \ me to the door of my hotel and laughed when I said I\u2019d call a taxi from there.\
  \ \n\nAs we drove to the airport I relaxed, Amira and I compared travel stories\
  \ and university courses, and she translated the funniest bits for her cousin. When\
  \ we approached the airport she taught me to say thank you in Arabic: Shokran.\n\
  \nI headed into the airport with hugs from two newfound friends, and a promise they\u2019\
  ll be the first I call when I make it back to Morocco."
