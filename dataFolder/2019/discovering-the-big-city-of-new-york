Text: "Last year I went to New York city with my family for 13 days.\nWe decided to\
  \ do this trip to celebrate my parents  30th anniversay of wedding.\nWe booked a\
  \ flat in New Jersey and moved everyday by bus into the big city of Manhattan.\n\
  It was the first time for me in America. \nIt was a surprising impact to see the\
  \ height of all those skyscrapers, especially the big World Trade Center.\nWe visited\
  \ the most important monuments and museums. \nIt was a dream to see all the places\
  \ that we have only seen through the movies. It was like entering in a movie. \n\
  We saw the statue of liberty that it was beautiful but at the same time i thought\
  \ it was bigger than that. I had this impression also for other things as Times\
  \ Square. I don't know why. Maybe because of all the movies I have watched set in\
  \ New York; through the movies everything appeared bigger.\nBut even if i saw all\
  \ those places a million time in the movies, for me it was a dream came true to\
  \ be there and see that all those things really existed.\nThe first days we decided\
  \ to see all the most important things as the Moma, the National museum, the statue\
  \ of Liberty, Central Park.\nI was happy to discover  Central Park by cycling. I\
  \ dindn't expect to find a place in the middle of the park where the people was\
  \ skating following the music; i found it very entertaining.\nWe have  decided to\
  \ live for those days as american people do. So we tried the street food as hot\
  \ dogs and chips. We used the tube to move in all the city. We saw Brooklyn, the\
  \ most beautiful part of New York on my opinion, arriving through the Brooklyn bridge.\n\
  We went to find the places of some movies as the pub that has inspired the Pub of\
  \ \"How met your mother\", the Mc' Gees. We found some places where they have set\
  \ \"Gossip girl\" as the Central station or the fountain in central Park.\nWe spent\
  \ our time to visit the city but also we took some time to see museums as the memorial\
  \ of the twins towers.\nOn my opinion it was  a breathetaking experience. I wasn't\
  \ ready to know and see all the things inside the museum. But even if i was shocked\
  \ seen some videos and knowing some stories of people who died in that terrible\
  \ day, I think that everybody must visit the memorial and be more conscious about\
  \ that fact.\nIn those days we had also the possibility to visit the ONU and become\
  \ more informed about their service.\nVisiting Coney Island we found the mermaid\
  \ parade. It was very funny because we found a lot of people wearing mermaid clothes\
  \ moving from Manhattan to Coney Island by the tube.\nThere were beautiful mermaids\
  \ who were dancing through the parade.\n During the holiday one of the most beautiful\
  \ thing that I saw it was the view from the Rockfeller Center, during the day, and\
  \ the view from the Empire State building by night.\nIn the first one unfortunately\
  \ there was some fog so the view wasn't so clear.\nWe decided to retry to see the\
  \ city from another point of view through the Empire state building.\nWe went there\
  \ by night  and it was awesome. Seeing the city that never sleeps illuminating by\
  \ all those lights was incredible. Before arriving on the top of the building I\
  \ was scared about the height but when I was there i forgot everything and I just\
  \ enjoy the view with the Statue of Liberty illuminated in the distance.\nDuring\
  \ the last days we decided to go out from the city and visit also Washington and\
  \ Philadelphia.\nAll the holiday was like to live in a movie. You can't believe\
  \ that some places exist until you see them.\nI really enjoyed the trip and I will\
  \ keep all of the memories forever in my mind and through the pictures that I have\
  \ made."
