Text: "This story will be about travelling around Portugal and unmasking the identity\
  \ of a place often known as a quick sidetrip from Spain. I will explore all the\
  \ wonderful reasons to visit it in its own right - touching on the singular history\
  \ of the 'peaceful revolution' in the 1970s, the hard times of the global downturn,\
  \ and its emerging status as a culinary centre of Europe if not the world.\nAmong\
  \ this broader picture I will include all my interactions with the locals - who\
  \ speak English very well, are very friendly and eager to help - and how my tentative\
  \ attempts to push the envelope reveal a playful populace keen to step outside the\
  \ usual polite discourse for an unexpected cheeky laugh and banter.\nThis starts\
  \ at the airport when the incredulous immigration offical questions why I am coming\
  \ to Portugal - and only Portugal - for 14 days. I say \"reckon that's long enough?\"\
  \ and he breaks into a grin, stamps my passport, and sends me on to my voyage of\
  \ pasteis de nata and garlic clams. It continues with the various other interactions\
  \ had along the way, such as the restaurant concierge repeatedly saying \"No, we\
  \ have no tables. No, we do not serve food here. No, you cannot come in\" with a\
  \ sly smile that is begging for me to play along until he guffaws and opens his\
  \ arms, beckoning me inside his establishment as if by humouring his playfulness\
  \ I have delivered the secret password to accessing all the Portuguese pleasures\
  \ of the palate on offer. \nThe tendency of taxi drivers in Lisbon to try to clock\
  \ 200km per hour as they enter a tunnel, whilst enthusiastically humming along to\
  \ Michael Jackson's \"Beat It\" on the radio (not sure why he was not singing -\
  \ uncomfortable with the English lyrics or a falsetto in company?) will also be\
  \ explored.\nA sweaty and sizzling hot half marathon through Lisbon with escalating\
  \ occurrences of public urination could also make it into the article, if the tone\
  \ allows.\nIn short, the article will distill large and small scale observations\
  \ of Portuguese culture, food, sightseeing, history and ambience into a morsel that\
  \ will leave the readership salivating to try it all."
