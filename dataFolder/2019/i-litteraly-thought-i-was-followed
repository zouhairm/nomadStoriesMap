Text: "Sometimes, i question the nature of human beings.\n\nIt's ingenuity, passion\
  \ in exploration.\n\nThen i found, between the beaches and mountains of nusantara,\n\
  \nHuman Ingenuity.\n\nPeaceful abodes lie upon tranquil lands, filled with culture\
  \ and tradition. The lands of Indonesia is something special, cultivating, yet mysterious.\n\
  \nI spent my time at a local hostel in Indonesia. As a budget traveler it's expected\
  \ to have lots of experience (or a very-somewhat-helpful guide) to enjoy the islands\
  \ fully. I've tried the highlights of Indonesia such as Bali, Nusa Penida, and a\n\
  Jakarta, so i expect to find something different.\n\nSo, i arrived at Central Java\
  \ to start our unexpected journey through Javanese Mysticism. We persuaded a local\
  \ guide with many talents to join us on this journey and to explain more about our\
  \ destination,\n\n\"Gunung Kawi\"\n\nIt was considered that gunung kawi is the most\
  \ active paranormal location, among all others, in Indonesia. With our wits, and\
  \ a little bit of google maps :) , we found the so-called entry of the mountain,\
  \ hidden in plain sight over the woods that surrounded the area.\n\nTotal silence.\n\
  \nWe can hear the birds chirping, yet there is something beyond human presence in\
  \ the area.\n\nAnyhow, our local guide brought a priest to soothe us that it's not\
  \ a horror movie, but instead a pleasant experience. Hes very helpful and you can\
  \ tip for around 3 or 4 bucks and he'll consider that a donation to the local temple\
  \ / mosque and give it away to poorer people in the region. He explains that the\
  \ mysticism here is more about heritage and spirituality more than it is.. well..\
  \ mystic things? well he introduced us to other \"white-magic\" priests and we got\
  \ some good-smelling scented candles, javanese-cultural souvenirs and more stuff\
  \ that increases the tropical aroma for my (and yours too, as so if you desire that\
  \ ^_^)\n\nWell, it didn't end there. Panoramic views surrounded us when we went\
  \ to Jogjakarta through a cheap-flight deal with CityLink\u2122, that helped us\
  \ get a decent hotel (yes, you backpackers can afford a decent/good hotel there\
  \ for a wonderful price), and whilst the traffic wasn't new york-bad it was pretty\
  \ dense when we arrived there and we were stuck for a few now-and-then.\n\nNow,\
  \ what y'all foodies are waiting for\n\nWell, there isn't an option to put pictures\
  \ here and it would be unfair to put a link here but let's go into it!\n\nThe Satay\
  \ is a (Halal, and Kosher) dish composed of peanut sauce and Chicken/beef/lamb,\
  \ and the gudeg is also a recommended dish if you're not new to Indonesia, but new\
  \ to Java.\n\nIf you're a vegetarian (or vegan!) you can try the Urap, a traditional\
  \ Indonesian serving composed of vegetables, an add-rice-if-you\n-want dish with\
  \ a certain local feel.\n\nInternational dishes are available there too, but, well,\
  \ when in java, right?\n\nWell, this is the end. My brain simply cannot create a\
  \ simple-and-organic story, but maybe you can!\n\nApply in www.worldnomads.com to\
  \ win a free trip to Portugal with the best-of-the-best of travel bloggers\n\nBye!!\n\
  \nOk guys thats the best i can do, Well, i think this is our goodbye, judges, have\
  \ a nice day y'all, and keep traveling!"
