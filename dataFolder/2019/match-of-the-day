Text: "Overnight, I had become a love God. \nWomen responded to my overtures like\
  \ ducks to bread. I was no longer a pint sized underachiever with receding hair\
  \ and aching joints. I was a babe magnet, who radiated charisma and success. My\
  \ every swipe right was a match.\nTen years ago, I\xB4d have been naiive enough\
  \ to believe it.\n\nUsing Tinder in Indonesia is not like using it in London at\
  \ all. The socio cultural frames of reference are entirely different. For some women,\
  \ a western man there offers the chance of a more prosperous life, but he also (speaking\
  \ very generally) sees women as equal to a greater extent than an Indonesian woman\
  \ might have come to expect to be seen. \n\nThe naiive and the desperate flock to\
  \ such places. But I was neither. I\xB4d been travelling for a while and I was bored,\
  \ feeling the loneliness of backpacking solo in vast, chaotic Jakarta. I wanted\
  \ to meet Indonesian folks who weren\u2019t hostel staff, taxi drivers and museum\
  \ guides and who would engage me in conversations deeper than \n\u201CWhere are\
  \ you from? How do you like Indonesia?\u201D\n\nSo I looked up Tinder. And having\
  \ filtered out the \u201CDon\u2019t swipe if you aren\u2019t looking for marriage\u201D\
  \ crowd, and the ones who would clearly require financial compensation for their\
  \ time, one woman emerged from the pack by conversing with me like a normal person.\
  \ And that is how I met Desari, in Starbucks one lunchtime. An Englishman meeting\
  \ an Indonesian at the American empire\xB4s greatest forum, having met on a mobile\
  \ phone app. It was a very 21st century date. \n\nShe wore red lipstick which was\
  \ set off by the red roses on her brightly coloured hijab, which I complimented\
  \ her on. \n\u201CI\xB4ve been wearing it for three years. I used to show my hair,\
  \ but putting on the hijab changed my life.\nI had a relationship\u2026a boyfriend\u2026\
  and we broke up. I was lost in the world. But I put on the hijab and prayed more\
  \ to God. It gave me a new confidence.\u201D\n\nShe worked in human resources but\
  \ was a real career journey-woman. Desari had apparently done more jobs in her 25\
  \ years than I had in my 34.\n\u201CI was an English teacher for a while\u2026\u201D\
  \n\u201CI was a customer sales executive for a company\u2026\u201D\n\u201CI used\
  \ to be a travel agent\u2026\u201D\n\nI asked where I should go in Indonesia, apart\
  \ from hedonistic Kuta and the world heritage temples in Yogyakarta.\n\u201CTry\
  \ Sumatra. There\xB4s the tsunami museum and great beaches. And you can climb Mount\
  \ Kerinci. If you\xB4re really lucky, there are a few tigers to see there.\u201D\
  \n\nI was to remember this conversation and the warm, comfy caf\xE9, as I huddled\
  \ in my tent on the side of this accursed volcano, the howling wind preventing sleep\
  \ and bathroom trips. My guide and I had slogged up jungle paths for eight hours\
  \ and collapsed exhausted at four o clock in the afternoon, ready for a dash to\
  \ the top at sunrise. Like the hobbits scurrying up Mount Doom, we cursed as the\
  \ stones slipped and slid beneath our feet in the dark and the wind tore at us as\
  \ if trying to blow us back down. And there was not a tiger to be seen.\n\nI had\
  \ heard that young Indonesians have taken to social media in a big way, and Desari\
  \ proved to exemplify this amply. Within an hour of us parting, she had posted a\
  \ selfie of us on Facebook and apparently had multiple accounts across a number\
  \ of platforms. I couldn\u2019t help wondering (and I had seen similar things in\
  \ the Arab world), how does a Muslim square this blatant self-promotion with the\
  \ daily abasement of self before Allah?\n\nBut I liked Desari. For all the roses\
  \ on her hijab, she was no wallflower, that was for sure. A century ago, she\xB4\
  d likely have been a farmer\xB4s wife.\n In the last century, Indonesia has been\
  \ swamped by two tsunamis. Bandeh Aceh was devastated in 2004, but the whole country\
  \ has been drenched by a globalizing, capitalist tsunami of the mind. The aftermath\
  \ has it\xB4s faults. But it has given women like Desari new waves to ride."
