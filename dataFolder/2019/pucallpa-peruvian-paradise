Text: "I landed in Pucallpa Peru, were I would be staying a few nights before trekking\
  \ deeper into the amazonian jungle for a 10-day meditation retreat. The air was\
  \ thick with moisture that instantly condensed onto my skin as I stepped outside\
  \ of the airport.  I had arrived!  I was fully prepared to walk the mile or so to\
  \ check-in to my BnB, but decided to hire one of the many locals that now surrounded\
  \ me, quickly learning that the main form of transportation in the region was motokar.\
  \  The breeze rushed through me as we zoomed down narrow streets, surrounded by\
  \ other motos.\nThe next morning I was alerted by my phone that a local was interested\
  \ in meeting up.  At this point i had only tentatively planned out my day so i messaged\
  \ her back right away.  Her name was Janina, and she suggested we meet for lunch\
  \ at her favorite restaurant!  It should have been no surprise, that she arrived\
  \ on a motorbike.  A brief moment of hesitation crossed me as i hopped on behind\
  \ her, \u201CI wasn\u2019t wearing a helmet!\u201D  But I decided to go with the\
  \ flow and enjoy the adventure. Rays of sun beat down on my sticky skin.  Maybe\
  \ I should have grabbed a long sleeve to protect my skin like all the other locals\
  \ who were wearing only the sleeves in order to cover their arms.\nThere were no\
  \ menus at this open-air restaurant. Janina ordered for me.  She asked what the\
  \ daily catches were and chose her favorite.  We were served chicken soup and fried\
  \ plantains with a side of aji, a thick and potent sauce made from the orange aji\
  \ pepper.  And to drink, a glass of purple chicha.  Finally our main dish arrived.\
  \  A freshly fried fish covered half the plate, eyes and teeth still intact!  Rice,\
  \ beans and a small salad covered the rest.  The entire meal cost a mere 5 soles\
  \ (~$1.50)! \nAfter lunch I needed to use a restroom and the restaurant being little\
  \ more than a three-walled shelter had none. Luckily Janina lived a few blocks away\
  \ so we headed to her house to refresh ourselves.  The inside of Janina\u2019s home\
  \ consisted of a hallway to the backyard and two small rooms on either side, her\
  \ bedroom and a spare.  We headed to her kitchen, which was situated on the patio\
  \ of her backyard.  She also had two restrooms, both of which were also outside.\
  \  She pulled up a few chairs for us to sit back and relax.  They reminded me of\
  \ elementary school chairs that had seen better days.  We talked about life, traveling\
  \ and work.  She was originally from the desert, but fell in love with the jungle.\
  \  She had a bachelor\u2019s degree in tourism and runs a small tourist business\
  \ via social media outlets.  She was in the process of creating an actual website\
  \ for her business.  \nJanina and I headed for the streets.  We rode along the Yarinacocha\
  \ Lake until the dirt road turned to mud.  We browsed art and souvenir stands featuring\
  \ items handmade by the native Shipibo people.  We cruised through Pucallpa city\
  \ centre and made another stop at a port along the Ucayali River.  Small bananas\
  \ still bunched on branches, mangos, sweet round cucumbers, green oranges, tiny\
  \ limes and other fruits lined the stands as well as raw fish.  Janina suggested\
  \ I try the camu camu juice, made from the small, sour berries. We made one final\
  \ stop at La Lapuna, an ancient tree more than 200 years old. Janina explained how\
  \ these trees reigned before the urban construction of the city.  At last, we said\
  \ our goodbyes, and I thanked her for the beautiful day.\nThat evening, I watched\
  \ the sunset from a hammock perched on the roof of the BnB.  I listened to the sounds\
  \ of the rain forest, the zooming of motos, and live music from a nearby discoteca.\
  \  A hummingbird buzzed past as I reflected on my day."
