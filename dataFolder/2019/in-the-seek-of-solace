Text: "My hazy mind grasped the feeling of the frigid December morning winds hitting\
  \ my face as the Auto Rickshaw we were cruising on shook like a loose cannon. Graves\
  \ upon graves, ancient graves, and newfangled graves were spread all alongside the\
  \ not so ample mountainous and rugged road we were travelling on towards the shrine\
  \ of the 16th century\u2019s most popular Sufi saint Kastir Gul Alias Hazrat Kaka\
  \ Sahib located in a scabrous and hilly area around 12km south of the Nowshera District\
  \ in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Pakistan. \nWe believed that my 16 year old body possessed\
  \ a demonic spirit within it and so how on the suggestion of one of my neighbors\
  \ and a little research on the tomb we found ourselves on our way to seek solace\
  \ and spiritual satisfaction and a journey to out possess my body of the spirits\
  \ residing within it. But for me it was just another leap into the unknown as I\
  \ didn\u2019t know if this place could actually free me from the dead weight I was\
  \ feeling or it would be just like many other places I went to have it out. \nThe\
  \ Rickshaw stopped in front of a sloppy pathway that lead up to a beautiful, scenic,\
  \ and ancient looking architecture. \u201CI don\u2019t want to go in there\u201D\
  \ came out a voice from my half conscious body. My mind was in a haze but lucky\
  \ for me that I could remember exactly what was happening around me. But even in\
  \ my half conscious state of mind I couldn\u2019t help but admire what appeared\
  \ in front of me. Taking our shoes off, we walked into the white mausoleum.  Inside\
  \ the mausoleum was a grave about eight feet long covered with clothes of red and\
  \ green with verses in Arabic written all over it. The white marbled floor was cold\
  \ under my bare feet but there was a warmth lingering in the air inside the tomb.\
  \ The walls of the tomb were covered with a beautiful floral pattern and mosaic\
  \ work in the style of the Mughal architecture.  The tomb was like an enigma, beautiful\
  \ and mysterious. Hung high on the ceiling was a colossal and beautiful chandelier\
  \ in rose and gold, its yellow lightening was bright and causing the architecture\
  \ of the tomb to become more vibrant. It was nothing like I imagined or read about\
  \ on the internet, indeed a leap into the unknown. \nI was told by a thin and lanky\
  \ middle aged man with a full beard and a fancy traditional hat with sequins on\
  \ it to get down on my knees and repeat a verse with my head touching the eight\
  \ foot long grave of Kaka Sahib. And so with uncertainty and a nod of approval from\
  \ my father I did what I was told. \n\u201CTake the girl down to the next tomb of\
  \ Sufi\u2019s generation\u201D The man then instructed putting a pinch of salt into\
  \ my palm and motioned for me to swallow it. And yet again I was obliged to swallow\
  \ the white substance. So bare foot and with my slippers in my right hand and my\
  \ left hand intertwined with my father\u2019s we started to make our way towards\
  \ the next tomb that passed through a little market of jewelry, souvenirs and food\
  \ items. Taking a left from that market we came across a narrow passage with lots\
  \ of graves on the both sides of it. Climbing the two steps of stairs I was guided\
  \ to enter a long and dark room. The room was dimly lit with no windows for the\
  \ sunshine to surpass and with many long graves in it which I suppose was the generation\
  \ of Saint Kaka Sahib. I was greeted by an elderly, wrinkled man who gave me a reassuring\
  \ smile. Taking my hand in his, he stuck a long wooden stick between my three fingers.\
  \ \u201CWho are you?\u201D he asked in a calm voice. And so my process of exorcism\
  \ began after which I only remember stepping foot out of the dim room with a feeling\
  \ of solace and spiritual satisfaction. This leap into the unknown blew a new life\
  \ in me and helped me seek my solace."
