Text: "We had travelled 15 hours north by bus, from the glaciers of Chile\u2019s Patagonia,\
  \ to the middle of the country. For almost 2 weeks we had been surrounded by breath\
  \ taking landscapes of snowy tipped mountains, icy waters and our personal highlight,\
  \ Laguna San Rafael. Patagonia was an incredible, unique place but we were looking\
  \ forward to being back in civilisation. There are only so many times you can play\
  \ rummy with two people.\_\n\nOur bus bypassed the hectic and smoggy Santiago, and\
  \ headed for Valparaiso. We had heard Valparaiso was Chile\u2019s city of artists,\
  \ poets and painters \u2013 so naturally it was a must-visit on our \u2018To-Do\u2019\
  \ list. The coastal city is built on the steep surrounding mountains, and feeling\
  \ lethargic and weary after our bus ride we grabbed a taxi to our hostel, perched\
  \ right at the top of the mountain \u2013 great decision not walking.\_\n\nThe famous\
  \ street art we wanted to see happened to be down the mountain and on the other\
  \ side of town \u2013 we may have been travel partners for over 5 years but, not-so\
  \ deep down we were still those na\xEFve 19 year olds blindly stumbling around the\
  \ world. A humbling moment for us both. With the sun almost shining and the want\
  \ to stretch our legs we felt this was a perfect opportunity to walk off the excessive\
  \ bus snacks and see a different part of the city.\_\n\nWe knew roughly the direction\
  \ we wanted to aim for, and as long as we were walking downhill, we must be on track\
  \ (we'd thought). The streets were quiet, dainty and windy. The houses were very\
  \ modest and fairly well kept. There was an undeniable charm about the place, in\
  \ a rustic and run-down sense. As we turned one of many sharp corners, a blacked\
  \ out 4x4 passed us going in the same direction. It slowed slightly, then continued\
  \ down the road.\_\n\nDuring our quick twenty-minute Valparaiso research session\
  \ (a skimread of an out-of-date Lonely Planet, and a quick Google search), we knew\
  \ the city has had its problems and difficulties following the devastating earthquake\
  \ in 2010 \u2013 some of which are still lingering around today. Common sense and\
  \ a dash of good judgment seemed to be enough to keep you safe and still enjoy everything\
  \ the city has to offer. We had both visited \u2018riskier\u2019 places in the past,\
  \ and had somehow managed to leave them relatively intact.\_\n\nTurning another\
  \ corner, we saw the same blacked out 4x4 return \u2013 this time coming towards\
  \ us. The front window rolled down as the car came to a complete stop. In the front\
  \ were a man and woman who asked where we from, and where we were going. We were\
  \ warned that many of the children who lived in the area carried guns, and weren't\
  \ shy to use them.\_\nAfter successfully scaring the life out of us, he continued\
  \ driving away.\_\n\nAs grateful as we were for the heads up, we were already halfway\
  \ down the mountain. Should we turn around and go the way we came, potentially straight\
  \ into the hands of these gun-wielding 8 year olds, or should we continue risking\
  \ it and head to the city? It was really a lose, lose situation for us.\_\n\nThankfully,\
  \ we didn't have to make that decision because 30 seconds later a police car turned\
  \ up. With their limited English, our questionable Spanish and some crystal clear\
  \ hand gestures, the officers seemed to be re-emphasising the 'children-with-guns'\
  \ problem we had just wandered straight into. Just as we were finishing off our\
  \ game of charades with the officers (thank you very much theatre degree), our 4x4\
  \ friends returned and offered to take us down the mountain and drop us off in the\
  \ safety of the touristy spots. And before we knew it we had our own personal bodyguard/tour\
  \ guide showing us the sights and escorting us around the city. \n\nDespite the\
  \ kindergarten-mafia threat; Valparaiso is a beautiful city, full of some incredible\
  \ art and very generous and kind people. (Albeit some questionable children). My\
  \ only advise; spend an extra dollar a night to be in a decent location. Lesson\
  \ learned... until next time.\n\uFFFC"
