Text: "The very first thing I learned, on my very first international journey, is\
  \ how very American I am.  I met many people everywhere I traveled in Israel, and\
  \ even before I opened my mouth to speak, most people asked if I was an American.\
  \  I had never really thought of \u201CAmerican\u201D as a nationality before, but\
  \ I quickly embraced that national identity in a place where almost everyone I met\
  \ came from somewhere else.  \n\nMy friends, fellow Oregonians Paul and Don, were\
  \ also traveling in Israel, and we had met up at Abraham Hostel and decided to visit\
  \ Ancient Shiloh the next day.  We three came from a point of origin almost as far\
  \ away from Jerusalem as one could be and still be in the continental United States.\
  \  We had already traveled a tremendous distance to be there.  Even so, just getting\
  \ to ancient Shiloh on a Saturday morning was its own unique kind of adventure.\
  \  \n\nWe had enjoyed our breakfast together, and then had set out to try to find\
  \ our way to the park north of Jerusalem.  We were surprised to discover that mostly\
  \ all but the main streets in Jerusalem were blocked off.  Anytime we left a main\
  \ road, we found barricade after barricade, behind most of which peered Orthodox\
  \ faces bearing judgmental smirks.  In America, driving on the Sabbath is a perfectly\
  \ rational and normal thing to do.  In Israel, specifically Jerusalem, neighborhoods\
  \ come to a halt on Shabbat; walking is preferred, and cars are often not allowed\
  \ to interrupt. Our poor grasp of the Hebrew language also didn\u2019t help as we\
  \ rapidly learned that roads are not always named what Google thinks they should\
  \ be.  After some discussion, one small argument, and several U-turns, we had finally\
  \ reached our destination: and it was closed.  \n\nWe probably weren\u2019t supposed\
  \ to be there.  As soon as we stopped in the lot of the park surrounding Ancient\
  \ Shiloh, we all agreed it was closed.  Still, we got out without much further discussion,\
  \ gathered our things, and approached the unmanned booth in a hopeful sort of way.\
  \ When the \u201Cmagic eye\u201D triggered and the gate swung up, it seemed to us\
  \ to be an open invitation, so we walked on through.  \n\nThe world around us seemed\
  \ very silent after the noise of the highway, and our feet sounded very loud and\
  \ crunchy in the gravel.  The cool morning breeze was just beginning to give way\
  \ to the ever-present hot afternoon wind.  Our hike took us through a grove of olive\
  \ trees, where an Orthodox man and his two sons enjoyed a picnic lunch in the dappled\
  \ sunlight.  We passed without speaking, moving on beyond the shuttered gift shops\
  \ and empty administration buildings, to the flat-cleared rock where the big tent\
  \ had once stood.  This place, no longer sacred, was once the very dwelling place\
  \ of our god.   \n\nAfter a few moments of reading and fellowship we isolated ourselves\
  \ for prayer and meditation.  By myself, I removed my sandals and spread my bare\
  \ feet into the hot sand.  I closed my eyes and listened with my soul.  I spread\
  \ out my arms and stood in the sun and tried to pull the essence of Israel into\
  \ me.   I wanted to breathe her into my lungs; to take home her ancient secrets\
  \ and carry the taste of her dust in my mouth.  The hot wind felt like a spirit\
  \ blowing through me.  My prayer was silence; my meditation was an embrace of the\
  \ whole world.\n\nI found a new version of myself there in that ancient land.  A\
  \ depth of compassion, adventure, and childish awe was born inside me in this one\
  \ place I had only ever dreamed I might see.  I had placed my feet in the path of\
  \ my ancient ancestors, and it had changed me.  I found a sense of completeness\
  \ and a connection with souls of the past.   I will always be an American, but in\
  \ Israel I became something much more.  By opening my heart, I have become part\
  \ of the earth, part of the sky, and part of every people."
