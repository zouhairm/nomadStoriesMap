Text: "Have you ever wondered what is out there, beyond the usual, the routine of\
  \ the daily life? Most of us are too busy, engrossed in getting by from month to\
  \ month, wage to wage. How can we break out of this vicious cycle?\n\nIt can begin\
  \ by letting ourselves to dream a little. Or sometimes hitting full throttle on\
  \ life.\n\nI dreamed of being a traveler ever since I was little. On I went, a pup\
  \ of a boy, to join class excursions, trips with my mom and grandparents to lands\
  \ far and near, exploring castle ruins, museums, caves, islands, nature trails and\
  \ other exciting attractions, both man-made and naturally pristine. The idea of\
  \ and strive for travelling somehow seems to be embedded into my very being. It\
  \ has taken me as far as solo trips through the whole Europe and half across the\
  \ Atlantic Ocean, where I stumbled upon a true jewel\u2014an island that's warped\
  \ and twisted into beautiful shapes by the elements.\n\nIn the far north of the\
  \ Big Pond, Iceland lays invitingly next to its larger, snowy sister\u2014Greenland\u2014\
  yet seemingly more accessible and wildly alluring. \nWhy I came to this corner of\
  \ the world? To see things thousands of miles away, things hidden behind walls and\
  \ within rooms, things dangerous to come to, to draw closer, to see and be amazed.\
  \ As befits a movie quote, more often than not, it hits true and hits home for various\
  \ people all over the world. As it did for me. The Secret Life of Walter Mitty worked\
  \ as a bait and I gladly got hooked. Maybe I saw parts of me reflected in the main\
  \ character\u2014one of the endless Walters, stuck in a hamster's wheel, running\
  \ and not really knowing where to. But something in me chose the red pill (as per\
  \ Matrix saga), or the red car (as in the fictitious world of Walter Mitty), and\
  \ pressed the gas pedal hard.\n\nDuring wintertime, the travel fare from Europe\
  \ to Iceland doesn't dig deep into the pockets even for a budget traveler such as\
  \ me, and, thus, I embarked on my journey, which took me not only across space,\
  \ but also time. For Iceland enchants and creates a feeling that you have been transported\
  \ to an age, where you could encounter a living Viking village around the next bend\
  \ in the mountainside, or, if your imagination is as lively as mine, even a dragon\
  \ with a belly full of fire, atop Vatnaj\xF6kull or any of the number of gigantic\
  \ glaciers spilled across the island.\n\nUpon arriving in Reykjav\xEDk, the capital\
  \ city of Iceland, I was instantly awestruck. On my own, I embarked upon a regular\
  \ tourist trip. It took me to Gulfoss, a grand waterfall, frozen over while carving\
  \ its way through a deep gorge, down to Haukadalur Valley with the hot spring Geysir\
  \ that lent its name to all geysers on this Earth. Finally, I was able to float\
  \ in the happy warmth of a geothermal bath. A great ending to an even greater day.\n\
  \nLater, thanks to an open mind and no concrete plan, I luckily hit it off with\
  \ some of the other travelers, staying in the same backpackers' hostel, and joined\
  \ their adventure towards the nearby mountains.\n\nWhilst driving, I witnessed sights\
  \ which belonged to another world: towering mountains and wide, snow-covered fields.\
  \ On this day, one of my lifelong dreams came true\u2014the Climb. Snow. Exhilaration.\
  \ Breathless elation. Everything rolled together in one big feeling, and I felt\
  \ like on cloud nine. But maybe more importantly, I felt I was among friends.\n\n\
  Limited by time and rather exuberant costs of inland travel, I didn't have the opportunity\
  \ to greet the might of Eyjafjallaj\xF6kull, or to walk the sands on the famous\
  \ black beach of V\xEDk. However, upon returning home I came to a conclusion that\
  \ I was given, by this sometimes unforgiving, but truly magnificent landscape and\
  \ the people I met along the way, the very essence laid down in the quote.\n\nTo\
  \ see, to be amazed, and simply be happy."
