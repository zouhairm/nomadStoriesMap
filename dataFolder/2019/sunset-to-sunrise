Text: "On a train for 22 hours. \nI'll admit, that may not sound like a thrilling\
  \ adventure, but I'm here to tell you why it was a ride of a lifetime...\n\nAs the\
  \ sun sunk down over the bouquet of palm trees I heard the horns. The train pulled\
  \ into the San Juan Capistrano Depot announcing its arrival. You are able to enjoy\
  \ the excitement of it coming for just a minute. Just as you take out your camera\
  \ to get a picture, the conductors are yelling \"all aboooooard!\" There are no\
  \ boarding groups, no long lines, but definitely, an urgency to jump on this paused\
  \ transportation before it starts its engine again... and leaves you!\n\nTaking\
  \ my steps up to my assigned seat, my heart is still beating. Only is it when I\
  \ sit down in my window coach seat that I exhale and settle in. I was ready to start\
  \ my 22 journey on the tracks.\n\nSome modes of transportation may feel restricting,\
  \ but not the train. Once my heartbeat slowed down, I was off--- off to the \"Observation/Lounge\
  \ Car\" area of the train, or as I like to call it \"The Eyes of the Train.\"  This\
  \ area allows passengers to sit down and truly enjoy the views of the voyage- which\
  \ iisn't hard when three-fourths of your surrounding is transparent with windows.\
  \ I stay in this area, headphones in, pen and journal out, simply documenting what\
  \ I was witnessing. From the landscape to those also enjoying the views I can't\
  \ help but look at it all and feel free. There is something so liberating about\
  \ being surrounded by strangers and sights that are fleeting.  \n\nThrough California,\
  \ the headlights of the automobiles on the highway pierced through the darkness.\
  \ As we passed through Flagstaff, Arizona, the track lights reflected brightly off\
  \ of the glistening 13 inches of snow on the ground. All of the strangers, that\
  \ I sat there watching and wondering what their story was, had either departed the\
  \ train or gone back to their seats. \n\nWe are allowed a \"Fresh Air Stop\" at\
  \ certain parts of the ride. Passengers get five minutes to deboard the train, get\
  \ fresh air, get their nicotine fix, or just stretch their legs.  I opt to stroll\
  \ up and down the walkway, nodding my head at fellow \"fresh air stoppers\" and\
  \ taking in the differences of this new depot. until I hear a familiar charge, \"\
  all abooooard.\" \n\nHours passed and state lines were crossed. The palm trees of\
  \ California that turned into Arizona ponderosas, were now leafless aspens of New\
  \ Mexico. The change of landscape reminded me of the ever-changing aspects of life\
  \ that we may not be able to control or predict, yet can be so beautiful.  I go\
  \ back to my seat in solidarity with the other travel pillow-using riders who have\
  \ turned in for the night. Strangers sleeping all around me, and yet I felt at home\
  \ in my thoughts. There is peace.\n\nStreams of yellow and orange creeping over\
  \ the mountains of Nuevo Mexico started to knock on the door of my eyelids, encouraging\
  \ a lift. The calendar day had changed and three states later, it was a new day,\
  \ but with the same solace.  To welcome the morning, I ate a breakfast burrito (as\
  \ any typical New Mexican would do) and hydrated with the reasonably-priced bottle\
  \ of apple juice that they offered in their snack car.  Through catching my sliding\
  \ cards during my game of solitaire I would look up and appreciate the change of\
  \ terrain. From green to white, to now yellow and brown the ground went on my trip.\n\
  \nBefore I knew it, the conductor comes to me and says \"next stop is yours.\" \
  \ I hurried off the train, with the same urgency I had when I got on it.  As I stood\
  \ at the Lamy, NM depot, with my luggage in my hands, I stared back at the train\
  \ whose \"freight\" might as well be freedom. It yelled it's way out and headed\
  \ into the mid-afternoon sun.  I hope get to slow down and jump on a train, to get\
  \ to have the liberation that can be felt from such sunset to sunrise."
