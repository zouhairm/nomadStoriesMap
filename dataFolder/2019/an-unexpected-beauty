Text: "On my school vacations in July of 2010, me and my family decide to travel in\
  \ craving of knowing something different. In time, I had 10 years old and the weather\
  \ was freezing, but nothing that the comfort of a motor home did not overcome.\n\
  We left Carazinho, where we lived, towards one of the coolest cities of our state,\
  \ Cambar\xE1 do Sul. There, we passed three days visiting places of unique beauty,\
  \ riding horses, fishing, riding bikes and doing all the things that we didn't do\
  \ throughout the year. However, that tour still didn't mean \u201Cthat\u201D different\
  \ thing.\nWe always loved so much things involving water. Anything related to pool,\
  \ sea and rivers made us happy. But in that freezing weather, how can we find some\
  \ entertainment related about this? That's how came the idea to visit Arapey thermal\
  \ waters in Uruguay.\nWe dismantle and prepared our camp and motor home to leave\
  \ early next day. We leave at the daylight and my father drove up to the Porto Alegre\
  \ city, were we slept in the courtyard of a gas station. The next day we went up\
  \ to Quara\xED city, the only city that borders with two countries. So, the different\
  \ things started.\nThat day was very rainy, so we cannot appreciate the view like\
  \ we pretended to do, we traveled a long way until we got to Arapey city in Uruguay.\
  \ There, we arrived at our destination, a campsite.\nWhen I went to use the bathroom,\
  \ I got scared because I didn\u2019t saw any electric shower, just pipes coming\
  \ off the wall. I started to imagine take a cold shower in that freezing temperature,\
  \ so I went wash my hands and I found that in all water tap we got hot water. In\
  \ the morning we decided to take a walk around the area, and we saw a different\
  \ animal. We got closer to this different animal, and to our surprise it was a llama.\n\
  During the afternoon, with a more pleasant weather, we decided go to the pools.\
  \ During the course of the campsite to the pools area, we were dressing coats and\
  \ swimsuits under the winter clothes, a contradictory scene. When we looked at the\
  \ pools it seemed like big cauldrons boiling with people inside. The temperature\
  \ of the ambient and the heat of the water inside the pools which reached 40 degrees\
  \ formed a smoke that bleached our visual field. It was pure fun in that soup of\
  \ people!\nWe stayed a few more days visiting other regions and knowing other customs\
  \ and then we decided to leave home.It was almost noon when we approached the Bella\
  \ Union city, near the borderline. \nA small town with approximately 13 thousand\
  \ habitants and apparently poor, where the economy turned to the dependent commerce\
  \ on the tourists that visit there, a huge presence of old cars models, some of\
  \ them abandoned in the street and most of the houses built with stones and moss\
  \ greening in the walls. In that moment, the kids were leaving the school. All of\
  \ them dressing a white coat over their clothes and a dark blue bow around his neck,\
  \ a model dressed in his parents' time. \nBut what I did not expect to find was\
  \ that instead of backpacks and books, all the students had a green and white laptop\
  \ in their hands. That device was not very cheap and I was very fond of having one.\
  \ We were impressed with that evolution and when we got home, we searched of the\
  \ evolution. What should be done with the computer? The plan was: A computer for\
  \ each student could serve to encourage reading and thereby reduce the gap of knowledge\
  \ among students in private schools. They were free to take the laptop home with\
  \ them and their family members could also enjoy it. The teachers were forced to\
  \ learn how to handle the machine and teach the students. In Brazil there was an\
  \ idea of a similar program, but it never left the paper. Finally, what I found\
  \ in that poor and visually backward city was the action of a government concerned\
  \ to make way for prosperity, access to knowledge for all."
