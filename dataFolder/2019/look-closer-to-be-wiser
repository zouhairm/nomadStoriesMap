Text: "Look Closer To Be Wiser\nBy Dian Nafi\n\nI just have argued with my nephew\
  \ about this place. He insists the institution whom with he will collaboration is\
  \ a qualified one. But as long as I heard, that institution is affiliating with\
  \ the radical and extreme group, so I ask him to cancel his plan to make cooperation\
  \ with them.\nWho knows that only few days after those hard debate and arguments,\
  \ I am invited to that place, the center of that institution that I avoid previously.\
  \ All happens by coincidentally. My friend from my previous college who live in\
  \ Malaysia recently, call me. She will visit her daughter at that institution and\
  \ ask me to join them because a good purpose. She wants her daughter learn about\
  \ writing from me. She pays me for everything, travel cost, hostel and of course\
  \ tuition for two days workshop. Because this is my job, so I come professionally\
  \ as tutor, trainer and coach. \nI travel by train to Depok and everything that\
  \ I found later is quite different with I thought before. Moreover, it very surprise\
  \ me. What I see and feel is only beauty, peace, innovation and spirit of progress.\
  \  \nMy steps become steadier when I enter the district. I don\u2019t even find\
  \ something that scary as people out there talking about this place and institution.\
  \ Indeed I feel peace and comfortable. I also can feel the pleasant ambience. I\
  \ thought it is because people who live in this place and institution always read\
  \ quran, learning and talking about positive things. They apply what they learn\
  \ in their life so there are only good habit and behavior. \nPeople who meet me\
  \ from the beginning until the end of my visit, are all friendly, hospitable and\
  \ always give smile and soft words. I think that is their original style every day.\
  \ Not just lips service because they don\u2019t even know who I am. I come with\
  \ special invitation, so we can say I am only smuggler.\nThere are some buildings\
  \ that laid at some districts. All occupants stay there for years with various purpose.\
  \ Mostly they come from many islands of this country, Indonesia, for learning Islamic\
  \ knowledge and its cultivation.\nThey place me at their central office. Two-story\
  \ building with minimalist style architecture. I live with my friend and her daughter\
  \ at guest bedroom. We can make our own coffee every time we need. While I accompany\
  \ my new mentee doing her homework, I can also enjoy my coffee and read my newest\
  \ books that I just bought on bazaar around there. \nMy friend tell the story about\
  \ that place and institution who help her to make and accomplish her dissertation.\
  \ And everything I hear about that place and institution make me so proud with them.\
  \ They have noble mind to prepare the next generation. Not just to be smart people\
  \ but also spiritual person. A whole package.\n It is really great movement and\
  \ good for our country.  I can see the application on my new mentee. She is only\
  \ fifteen, but she has memorized 30 juz of quran. She is also diligent and absorb\
  \ my writing lesson quickly. Her writing can express well her thoughts and feelings,\
  \ but also applying what I teach her that weekend. \nSo I can say here, that we\
  \ should close closer to become wiser. Because sometimes the negative presume and\
  \ bad stigma that spread between societies, is not the real fact. Maybe because\
  \ some bad people don\u2019t want any other great and positive community have influence\
  \ and give good contribution to this country. So just come and look closer. \nBetween\
  \ my task teaching and coaching my new mentee in that inspiring place and institution,\
  \ I also have time to visit Masjid Dian Mahri. People also call it as Masjid Kubah\
  \ Emas Depok. The area is very large. The mosque is very beautiful. I am drowning\
  \ to enjoy the pole row, the aisles. Very lovely and attractive.  \nThere are many\
  \ other destination in Depok that I still don\u2019t have enough time to visit all.\
  \ But I promise I will visit Depok again for that purpose. And I also want to come\
  \ and visit that institution again."
