Text: "Travelling to foreign places ,local or international is an adventure. The ducoveries\
  \ one makes and classic items one finds is ,for lack of a better word,magical. \n\
  \n Mostly,I've traveled to my country's national parks and game reserves. I've seen\
  \ different cultures...rich cultures and tasted their unique dishes. I loved some\
  \ enough to ask for the recipe to try and master the art. \n\nBeing a nursing student,\
  \ the knowledge of natural healing herbs is quite intriguing. A shrub known as \"\
  mwarubaini\" is said to be able to cure forty different illnesses. A myth I'm yet\
  \ to discover whether it's true or not. Aloe vera treats stomach upsets and ginger\
  \ tea ,headaches. I only know little of these plants. \n\nThere's this time I'd\
  \ gone to a small village where baboons usually visit in the morning . To say I\
  \ was scared is an understatement. The babboons I was used to seeing were cartoons.\
  \ Smaller than the real ones and friendly. The ones I saw were mean and hungry.\
  \ I suppose the were males. It was a site to see and a memory never to be forgotten\
  \ with their bare bottoms and angry faces.\n\nMeeting new faces and walking on a\
  \ different ground is worth the muscle cramps and sun burns."
