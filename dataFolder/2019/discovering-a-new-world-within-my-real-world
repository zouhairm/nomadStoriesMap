Text: "I come from a little town in the north of Oaxaca, Mexico. So, in my town there\
  \ are a lot of beautiful places and small towns.\nMy friends invited me to do a\
  \ trip to a small town that is called Teoltalcingo, we had a expectation about this\
  \ place, beacause we thought that all will be like in mour town. During our way,\
  \ we were singing and talking about people, the river, food, etc. \nOh, it was a\
  \ surprise beacuse before to arrived to the downtown, there was a river,  a big\
  \ river and it was very complicated to move our car, so we had to work together\
  \ to make way, we got dirty and mud, all my friends used to travel with their best\
  \ clothes, but it was a bad idea.\nFinally, 8 hours later we arrived to Teotalcingo,\
  \ I wanted to eat somenthing, I was very hungry I had to work for hours and we had\
  \ to drink the river\xB4s water.\nIt not was like I imagined, I met poor people,\
  \ there\xB4s not a complete bathroom, there\xB4s not a complet house, there\xB4\
  s not a complete food, instead, there were many children whitout enough clothes,\
  \ without shoes and I was thinking about in how to help all that people, I forgot\
  \ my fun and I decided to talk with  that families and to make bigger my surprise,\
  \ in any moment they talk about money, food, clothes, shoes, they jus were talking\
  \ about happiness and they made me cry. \nThey invited us to swim in their big river\
  \ and take some tacos that they made in their houses, for me was incredible. I reacted\
  \ to this when I asked for the bathroom and really, their bathroom was not a big\
  \ room with a big door, I taked a shower in a small place covered by three pieces\
  \ of ruber, in a place were there werent\xB4n people, but during my stay I was very\
  \ happy and I understood that there are more importante things in this life to be\
  \ happy, I hyope to go again somje day to say \"thank you\" to all that people.\
  \ That trip changed my life. And that\xB4s not all. before to come back home, they\
  \ gave us a loto of fruits and vegetables, tortillas that they made one night before.\
  \ I arrived at home very happy and whit the sensation of a big hug that came from\
  \ innocent, strong and pure people. This trip was better than I imgined. THANK YOU,\
  \ TEOTALCINGO. :D"
