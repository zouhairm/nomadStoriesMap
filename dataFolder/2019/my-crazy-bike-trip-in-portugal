Text: "Where did the idea of cycling in Portugal come from? I don\u2019t remember.\
  \ Just suddenly one day something clicked in my head, and an idea appeared. \"Why\
  \ not?\" - I decided, and went to pack. It was an adventure and this is still the\
  \ best trip of my life.\nThe plan was to ride from Porto to Lisbon by bike and spend\
  \ about three weeks on the road (I was planning a very leisurely trip). Sketched\
  \ a route, booked hotels, and in the foggy morning went on the road.\nRiding a bike\
  \ between cities is amazingly interesting. You forget about everything in the world,\
  \ get off all tourist routes, and plunge into obscurity.\nI spent half a day on\
  \ the road, came to a new city, saw the sights, slept and went out again in the\
  \ early morning. Portugal, as it turned out, is perfect for road travel. There are\
  \ many interesting sights scattered throughout the country. Very often I came to\
  \ a small town, about which I knew nothing at all, and where I counted just for\
  \ the night, and suddenly I found many wonderful things: like a stunning view from\
  \ the cliff in Nazar\xE9, delicious cookies in Aveiro, or ancient aquiducs near\
  \ the Tomar.\nAlmost everything bad that could have happened on this trip happened.\
  \ On the first day my bicycle handlebar loosened and I could not make turns. It\
  \ turned out that my tools are not suitable to fix it. I already thought that I\
  \ would have to go all the way with this breakdown, but suddenly I found a repair\
  \ shop for mopeds. Nobody spoke English there. I gestured about the problem and\
  \ asked for help. The old master silently went for a wrench and fixed everything\
  \ in two minutes. At the same time he refused money for a cut.\nThe very next day\
  \ I got lost. I did not have internet connection. And at some point, I found myself\
  \ in the middle of the unknown. I didn\u2019t know where I was, and I didn\u2019\
  t have any idea where to go. People in the Portuguese outback, as it turned out,\
  \ speak almost no English. But everyone really wanted to help. I didn't even have\
  \ to ask for help. I was standing on the road, buried in a map, and the people themselves\
  \ came up to me and tried to suggest something, waving their hands and loudly explaining\
  \ something to me. And you know what? That helped. The crossroads behind the crossroads\
  \ they brought me to the right place\nMy bike broke again, I was stung by a bee,\
  \ it was too hot on some days, it was raining in others, it was difficult for me,\
  \ and at times I was very angry with myself for going on this unprepared trip. \n\
  I have seen many excellent tourist places in Portugal: the estates in Sintra are\
  \ very beautiful, Cape Roca is an amazing place (I later went back there to ask\
  \ my wife to marry me), the unfinished monastery in Batalha is fascinating. Portugal\
  \ is a country with a very long and rich history: here you can find Roman ruins,\
  \ traces of the Templars and Moors, palaces of the Romantic era, monuments from\
  \ the times of navigators, and many other things.\nBut the most important memories\
  \ for me were parts of the way far from these popular attractions. Workshop repair\
  \ mopeds with a silent master; the rise of the road on the way to Tomar (I remembered\
  \ it for the rest of my life); a small cafe somewhere on the way to Obidos, where\
  \ I, exhausted from the heat, ate three ice creams in a row; playing chess with\
  \ a local retiree in Aveiro; a group of cyclists who explained me local road rules;\
  \ some social center in Nazar\xE9, where I was allowed to use the Internet; a waitress\
  \ in Mafra who taught me to say \u201Cthank you\u201D correctly in Portuguese and\
  \ many other places and people.\nAll the most valuable you find when you plunge\
  \ into the unknown is my main discovery. This adventure can not be planned on the\
  \ basis of a guide. But the guide is still worth taking with you (as well as a wrench)."
