Text: "Hot summer and sea shining from my window. It's very blue ,but very boring.\
  \ Boring to me!   \n\nBroken up with my ex  boyfriend and suddenly friend, who is\
  \ Japanese,  came from London to enjoy the sea. I grown up in country Croatia in\
  \ which is just white people and not other nationalities so when we went to beach\
  \ people looked at him as he was some kind a exotic brid. We laughed a lot about\
  \ that. Mind that not harm in looking something interesting isn't it?\n\nMy friend\
  \ spend few days in my city, told me that I'm 'annoying with my self pity and crying\
  \ and the he is going to Austria meet with his friends there for some the film screening.'\
  \ \n \nI wish him to have a fun  and he proposed to go with him as I'm not doing\
  \ anything all day.\nSame day my ex came to see me which made me feel sick so I\
  \ decide that maybe travel to Austria is a good idea. So next day here it goes I\
  \ was at train station and here it goes I end up in Austria. Beautiful, but not\
  \ what I have imagined. I think the biggest shock was I end up sleeping in old monastery\
  \ and each time when I went to toilet there was a big statue of jesus staring at\
  \ me and I screamed each time out of fear. Mind that he looked creepy. Then soon\
  \ strange noises came up from the second floor and guy who run place said is just\
  \ a wind untile one night I bum into 14 year old boy who scremed stronger then me\
  \ by first confronting statue of jesus and then me. Turns up guy who run the place\
  \ keep second floor for problematic teens and run away kids. He was helping them\
  \ the best he could. So my sad ex story turn up almost in horror religious to social\
  \ problem. Honestly,  this is shortes I could put all this together as there no\
  \ words remaining."
