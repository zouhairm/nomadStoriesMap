Text: "Little did I know I would have such strong sense of attachment and tranquility\
  \ in the little town of Albi, Southern France. This town was almost like a paint\
  \ pot where you could easily lose yourself in the beauty of different shades and\
  \ hues of the dance of most vivid colours. Every building I found myself staring\
  \ for hours was unique with its middle-aged architecture but modest in style. That\
  \ was how Albi got to most of the people who are alien to itself, and shook them\
  \ to their very beings to be the most alive that they have ever been, by captivating\
  \ them to stare into its deepest streets and the stories of those teeny tiny figures\
  \ at its shutters on every window.\n\n       Yes, I was the best of myself while\
  \ I wandered through the streets of Albi, or took a little trip to its breezy bridge\
  \ hosting the river of Tarn. Five people with different stories, and the number\
  \ grew gradually in time, frequently found themselves lost into the stillness of\
  \ Albi and the Tarn. \nSun complimenting to another great afternoon in Albi, while\
  \ five of us took a little trip to the river Tarn. Everyone was in high spirits\
  \ and quite drowsy yet alert for the vivid coloured scenery before them. Everyone\
  \ was quite eager to eat what they packed in the small kitchen we all shared mostly\
  \ with laughter. It was the weather and mostly the very fresh air itself kept us\
  \ from ever wanting to go back to our modest house. That afternoon, even though\
  \ it was five years ago, still had its reminiscences vividly in our minds. That\
  \ juicy watermelon we freshly bought it from the market and the French cheese we\
  \ could never wait enough to eat with a good company of a bottle of red wine, and\
  \ the taste of river Tarn complimenting the rest, stuck on my mind and  still linger\
  \ today in my dreams. \nThat feeling while you watch a movie and see a convertible\
  \ car rolling along the longest highway while a pretty woman's shawl floats in the\
  \ air dreamily is pretty much the same with the every second of my exploration of\
  \ Albi. Never ever written a poem or rhymes myself, but this is what I feel when\
  \ I have a little throwback to that year of two thousand fourteen. That feeling\
  \ of fear that I would ever have to let Albi go would be my constant night dreams\
  \ that I woke up to a sigh to comfort myself with \"you are still here\"s.\n\n \
  \     From its cobblestone pavements to majestic brick cathedral of Saint-C\xE9\
  cile to the irresistible crepes welcoming you to take a bite while you appreciate\
  \ the stillness of Tarn, there is not a single memory that I would not want to celebrate\
  \ fifty years after then. Re-centering myself with these unforgettable experiences\
  \ that I had in Albi, well, was something that I did not expect to find surely,\
  \ and never could I imagine such a peculiar place encouring me to embark upon exploring\
  \ the newer ones."
