Text: "In October 2017, my sister and I embarked on our first ever sisters-trip to\
  \ Korea after watching the movie \"Train To Busan\". \n\nWhile we were on the train\
  \ to Busan, the train stopped at a station for more than an hour, businessmen started\
  \ leaving the cabin after making phone calls and we saw a couple of army men in\
  \ Seoul station.. everything looked like a re-enactment of the movie before the\
  \ zombie apocalypse happened! There were announcements made but they were all in\
  \ Korean, we couldn't understand a word and didn't have data connection as well.\
  \ We were pretty freaked and were ready to spot a zombie sooner or later, but after\
  \ some work in asking strangers around us, we got to know from the train attendant\
  \ that there was a storm ahead, which resulted the halt of the train. This left\
  \ us no choice but to alight and get to Busan by less conventional ways. We were\
  \ feeling lost but adventurous as we weren't sure how to get to Busan from there,\
  \ which was a 5 hours car ride. \n\nThankfully, it was a blessing in disguise. A\
  \ local man noticed two foreigners as lost as a blind pirate commanding his ship,\
  \ and he approached us with simple English to ask us if we were heading to Busan.\
  \ He was on a business trip to Busan and has offered to commute with us. We followed\
  \ him and got acquainted while we squeezed in the alternate train which took a longer\
  \ route but did ultimately bring us to Busan. \n\nIt was an hour long ride and we\
  \ got to know each other while he explained the local culture to us. He even offered\
  \ to bring us to our lodging and we ended the day with him bringing us to try Busan's\
  \ local delicacies. \n\nChecking off the list of things to do while travelling may\
  \ be the main objectives of all trips, however the surprise elements in each trip\
  \ have undoubtedly brought us unexpected returns. My Sister and I made a spontaneous\
  \ local connection and got to know more about the local culture, history and food\
  \ thanks to our new Friend, who we are still staying in contact with. \n\nMemories\
  \ and friendships forged are the best souvenirs from every trips."
