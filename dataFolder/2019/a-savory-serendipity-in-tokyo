Text: "\u201CYou don\u2019t like sushi? And you\u2019re going to Japan?\u201D\n\n\
  It was a question I had been asked a dozen or so times the week leading up to my\
  \ trip. There were many qualms I had for my first trip to Tokyo - and Asia - but\
  \ sushi was not one of them. I was headed to the culinary capital of the world,\
  \ the city with the most Michelin-starred restaurants, and a plethora of dining\
  \ options even for the pickiest of eaters. I was not exactly worried about disliking\
  \ sushi.\n\nMy first day in Tokyo I met my tour guide in Akihabara for a three-hour\
  \ introductory tour. She mentioned the three foods that everyone must try in Japan:\
  \ tempura, ramen, and sushi. I shrugged. Two out of three ain\u2019t bad.\n\nThe\
  \ next few days were filled with gluttony. I indulged in cheese corn dogs in Shinjuku\
  \ to takoyaki (octopus balls) in Ginza to the sweet, mochi-like dango in Harajuku.\
  \ My dinners included a multi-course tempura platter, bowls of mouthwatering ramen\
  \ with fried rice, savory pork and vegetable gyoza, and the delectable menchi katsu\
  \ (deep-fried hamburger). My taste buds were dancing.\n\nThe last day of my trip\
  \ approached. After a walking tour of the Asakusa area, a torrential downpour began.\
  \ I was hungry, but I needed shelter. I scampered over to the nearest subway station\
  \ and headed back to Shinjuku hoping the rain would lighten. Despite my wishful\
  \ thinking, it was still down pouring by the time I arrived. I had a ten-minute\
  \ walk to my hostel. My stomach continued to growl as I tiptoed through the puddles.\
  \ A small restaurant caught my eye. The sign - which I could only understand so\
  \ much of - read 160 yen a plate. Cheap food and no more walking in the rain? I\
  \ was sold.\n\nAs soon as I opened the door into the restaurant, I knew the abominable\
  \ mistake I had made. It was a sushi restaurant - equipped with a conveyor belt\
  \ whisking each plate around and around guests. Before I could even attempt an escape,\
  \ the hostess showed me to my seat. I sat down, calmly, knowing the menu would have\
  \ other options. She placed an English menu in front of me and I rapidly scanned\
  \ the menu. It became clear to me that there were no other options. \n\nI contemplated\
  \ for a bit. I could just leave, when will I ever be back here again? I could also\
  \ just order dessert, why not continue the gluttony? It had been years since I had\
  \ sushi due to my strong opposition, maybe my taste buds were desensitized enough\
  \ to stomach it. I studied the plates of sushi as they skated by me, cross-referencing\
  \ them with the menu in front of me. Fish, fish, and more fish. I began narrowing\
  \ down which one I could attempt first when an intriguing piece coasted by. The\
  \ seaweed rolled up ever so perfectly, packed with sticky white rice, and topped\
  \ off with a crab and mayonnaise salad. Worth a try, I thought. I snatched it.\n\
  \nI picked up my chopsticks and fumbled enough to clumsily seize the piece of sushi\
  \ and hastily maneuver it to my mouth. I tried to bite into it, but based on my\
  \ incisors\u2019 inability to cut through the seaweed and the diners\u2019 dismay\
  \ around me, I resorted to shoving the oversized piece into my mouth entirely. I\
  \ chewed it up fast to reduce my chipmunk-looking appearance and finally started\
  \ to taste it. My taste buds were not just dancing this time; they were spinning,\
  \ twirling, and bouncing.\n\nThe briny crab salad mixture complemented the sweet\
  \ vinegar-laden rice and seaweed. Pure bliss. I had no time to focus on my epiphany.\
  \ I grabbed more plates - sampling herring to shrimp to pickled ginger until I was\
  \ so full my stomach ached. \n\nAt the airport heading home, I read online that\
  \ taste buds change every 5-7 years. I was ready to try all sorts of new foods,\
  \ exotic foods I was too scared to try, never heard of, or thought I didn\u2019\
  t like. This savory serendipity opened my mind (and mouth) to endless new options.\
  \ But right now, I just want more sushi."
