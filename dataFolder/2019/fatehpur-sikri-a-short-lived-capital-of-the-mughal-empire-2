Text: "PROUD MUGHAL CAPITAL\nThe fortified city of Fatehpur Sikri lies just west of\
  \ Agra, home of the Taj Mahal. \n\nThe city was briefly the capital of the Mughal\
  \ Empire from 1571 to 1585, when then Emperor Akbar abandoned it to fight another\
  \ campaign, and it was eventually completely abandoned in 1610, due to an insufficient\
  \ water supply.\n\nTo get up to the entrance of the walled city one can take an\
  \ auto-rickshaw (costly!) or the government shuttle bus costing 10 Rupees per person,\
  \ leaving every 10 or 15 minutes. Clearly, the bus is the better option, but it\
  \ is not the height of luxury. The journey only takes 10 minutes.\nTRIBUTE TO A\
  \ SAINT\nThe story goes that Emperor Akbar established the city from the twin villages\
  \ of Fatehpur and Sikri, supposedly as a tribute to a famous Sufi saint who had\
  \ accurately predicted the birth of Akbar's much longed for son, Jahangir.\n\nThere\
  \ are licensed guides available at the ticket counter at the Diwan-e-Am gate, and\
  \ it is recommended to take a guide from there only, as there are many fake guides\
  \ roaming around. Fatehpur, a religious place, with the Jama Masjid mosque, and\
  \ the tomb of the Sufi Saint Salim Chishti, and Sikri, the main palace area, where\
  \ Emperor Akbar, his three wives, and son lived.\n\nTo enter the mosque area you'll\
  \ need to take your shoes off. Sadly, the area is dirty and poorly maintained with\
  \ lots of people, hawkers and beggars.\nWALLED CITY\nSitting on a 40 metre high\
  \ rocky ridge, Fatehpur Sikri is primarily built of red sandstone and is roughly\
  \ 3 kilometres in length by 1 km wide, surrounded by a 6 km wall on three of its\
  \ sides with the fourth side bordered by a lake.\n\nThe complex combines Islamic,\
  \ Hindu and Christian architecture, reflective of the religions of Akbar's three\
  \ wives.THE DIWAN-I-KHAS\nThe Diwan-i-Khas (Hall of Private Audiences) is a magnificent\
  \ structure featuring a single pillar (the Lotus Throne pillar) that supported Akbar's\
  \ throne. It is a plain square building with four chhatris on the roof.\n\nThe central\
  \ pillar has a square base and an octagonal shaft, carved with geometric and floral\
  \ designs, with thirty-six serpentine brackets supporting a circular platform connected\
  \ to each corner of the building on the first floor by four stone walkways.It was\
  \ a chilly and misty early January morning when we visited, with few tourists around.There\
  \ are numerous important monuments in Fatehpur Sikri such as the Panch Mahal a five\
  \ storey building meant for the royal ladies and mistresses, with the top story\
  \ offering a panoramic view of the surrounding area. \n\nOther buildings include\
  \ the Palace of Jodha Bai, Birbal Bhawan, Diwan-i-Aam and Karawan Serai. My particular\
  \ favourite, as you could guess from the photographs, was the Diwan-i-Khas.The Anup\
  \ Talao is an ornamental pool with a central platform and four bridges leading towards\
  \ it.\n\nThe various buildings that surround it include the Khwabgah (House of Dreams),\
  \ Akbar's residence, the Panch Mahal, the Diwan-i-Khas, the Ankh Michauli and the\
  \ Astrologer's Seat, in the south-west corner.As we were leaving we came across\
  \ an interesting structure, over which historians have been arguing whether this\
  \ had been a stable used to house 200 horses, camels, and elephants or simply servants\
  \ quarters.\n\nFrom the architecture of other historic \"stable\" buildings in Rajasthan,\
  \ the stone rings through which restraints could be run clearly suggests these were\
  \ for securing animals, and therefore it is, after all, a stable.And then it was\
  \ time to walk downhill and take our leave of this ancient monument.\n\nThe last\
  \ thing I noticed was a small tomb or sarcophagus structure on top of which rested\
  \ a drape covered \"body\". I do not know if the \"body\" was stone, and part of\
  \ the structure, or really a dead person, for I did not look, as one or two people\
  \ were placing flowers on it. Intriguing.\nGETTING THERE\nFatehpur Sikri lies about\
  \ 40 kilometres west of Agra in the Indian state of Uttar Pradesh. It can be easily\
  \ visited on a day or half day trip from Agra.\n\nBy bus the cost is around 50 Rupees,\
  \ but by taxi or private car it could be as much as 1,800 - 2,000 Rupees."
