Text: "Depicting the lives of local people:\nThe local people's lives in cities or\
  \ villages along with the beautiful scenery of the area are some of the things that\
  \ you can register in the camera frame. I may even be able to capture more durable\
  \ images by familiarizing local people and people in the region with their daily\
  \ life. These images are more than lasting for beauty, I respect the localities\
  \ and be aware of their culture, rules and beliefs and register them with portraits.\
  \ By doing so, I can beautifully depict the beauty and difference of people who\
  \ have no knowledge of them. For this purpose, I should always look smart and with\
  \ a sharp look around. I try to hunt moments and situations that reflect the culture\
  \ and tradition of the people of the region \nStorytelling with photos:\nLandscape\
  \ photography must have a special story and subject. No matter which scene I take,\
  \ photo must have a focal point. Maybe this is a bit strange, but only taking pictures\
  \ of mountains and forests without purpose will have no effect on the viewer. I\
  \ try to convey a message to the viewer with my own photos, also, by taking multiple\
  \ photos in a row from one area, I can define the story of the local people's life;\
  \ how they dress, how they work, where they live and where they are resting. I will\
  \ set a specific theme for my photos to give a graphic story. Iou can take a day\
  \ to wake up in the morning to sleep at night and portray my stories.\nTake as much\
  \ as i can. Perhaps this is the only opportunity I will have been traveling to the\
  \ city or country I want, so I have to get a lot of photos. I need a lot of patience\
  \ to capture beautiful and beautiful nature photos. Perhaps I record a moment, never\
  \ again in nature. So, I always ready to capture lasting moments.\n I am going to\
  \ write my travel story about places I visit. Sometimes by asking the people around\
  \ us to visit the most beautiful places, which we have not gone, I want to have\
  \ a fresh experience of trip. Portugal has a lot of tourist places of interest that\
  \ may be none of us has the experiences of traveling there. One the other hand,\
  \ any city chosen for tourism destination may be more attractive in the season of\
  \ year. Its important to choose the right time to travel to the place I am going\
  \ to go.\nI am going to introduce the spectacular places for traveling there and\
  \ telling my travel experiences and the benefits of traveling there. I will write\
  \ the sights of the city in which I visit, and will tell other audiences to select\
  \ as a destination for their trip. I can even tell the tourist facilities and exciting\
  \ moments. I will take good pictures and capture as well as from the best moments\
  \ of traveling. I am going to take some good pictures of the best moments of my\
  \ life in Portugal. I will write about the culture of the area that I am going for\
  \ traveling. I will do my behavior as close as possible to the tradition of the\
  \ area and, preferably, dress up appropriately to the place I am in. I try to respect\
  \ the sensitivities in the communities that you are presenting and do not go against.\
  \ I have to say that in this way, i try to make myself a people who are in the city\
  \ or village, and they trust me more and I can take photos of their faces or their\
  \ homes. \nBefore I go to destination, I will sure to find out that places of interest\
  \ to get information about culture of the people in the area and look at the picture\
  \ of travel guide for that city or region to determine which section is suitable\
  \ for visiting.\nI want to make beautiful photos on the trip, go to the heart of\
  \ the events. I go up the mountain to have a different look. I take photos of all\
  \ angles to find the best angle and then shoot."
