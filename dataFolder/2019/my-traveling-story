Text: "Being a travel lover I chose my destination to the love place \"TajMahal\"\
  \ situated in agra, uttarpradesh (India). 4.7km from the agra cantt railway station.\
  \ \nAs I stood on the entrance I saw the magnificent monument which took 22 years\
  \ to built. \nHistory symbolizes the love of a mughal king-Shah jahan in the resemblance\
  \ of his wife-mumtaz who died in 1631 after giving birth to their 14th child. \n\
  I went close to view the grave of his wife inside the place with high securities\
  \ of police to safeguard the world heritage. My eyes witnessed the hand art work\
  \ of 22,000 laborers, carvers, painters and masons carved on the marbles. 3.2m rupees\
  \ were spent to built the beauty what we see today. 7-8m tourists per year needed\
  \ to wore the sacks to keep the marbles clean. \nSurfing around I saw the palace\
  \ sats on the bank of yamuna river in red sandstones. Due to increment in the traffic\
  \ I saw the blurry picture of the palace. \nCurrently the heap of the monument is\
  \ getting infectious by the UVrays pentrating through the ozone hole detoring the\
  \ beauty in yellowish color. \n'India : the country of love & inspiration never\
  \ makes the traveler like me to sits at one place\".\nMany bollywood movies use\
  \ this place for the best contents & I too chose this white beauty for my traveling\
  \ story."
