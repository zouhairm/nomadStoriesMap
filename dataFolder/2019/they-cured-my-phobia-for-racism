Text: "At exactly 10am on the 21st of October 2017, I and two other students from\
  \ my university were at Muritala Mohammed Airport, Lagos Nigeria. We were getting\
  \ ready to fly for the first time. The pride of being chosen to represent Nigeria\
  \ in an international competition reflected on our faces and could be seen clearly\
  \ in the pictures we took to mark the day.  \n\nIt was 12pm when the boarding announcement\
  \ for passengers travelling to Argentina called out loud from the speakers, \"that\
  \ is our flight call\" Queen said. But for me it was more of a reminder that I was\
  \ about leaving Africa for the first time for a country whose majority consists\
  \ of people I consider white skinned, with bright pink lips and intimidating long\
  \ curly hair. Suddenly I remembered all the black racism home videos I had watched\
  \ and my heart skipped. \n\nIt was night when we arrived in Buenos Aires and though\
  \ it did not seem like night because the lights and colors of the airport blinded\
  \ my eyes. I started comparing the beautiful airport to the crowded one I had left\
  \ from in Nigeria. I was interrupted when I heard the lady who was supposed to check\
  \ me in struggling to pronounce my native name \u201Cchidera\u201D. She made a face\
  \ when I helped out with the pronunciation, she seem to hate my name or even my\
  \ voice I thought. \n\nA taxi was waiting for us with our names written on a placard\
  \ when we stepped into the cold which I rated 20 times worse than the harmattan\
  \ cold in northern Nigeria. The taxi driver seemed too happy to meet us; I couldn\u2019\
  t help but consider it a professional act. We drove in silence to our hotel, allowing\
  \ our eyes to do most of the communications with awed glances at each other when\
  \ we saw something stunning. \n\nThe hotel room was cozy, it beat my expectations\
  \ yet I couldn\u2019t get any sleep. It was a long night of tossing and starring,\
  \ with my mind set on tomorrow mostly thinking about what to expect or rather what\
  \ I expected from the foreign students.\n\nWe arrived at the competition arena by\
  \ 9am the following morning, the driver of the taxi we boarded couldn\u2019t speak\
  \ English and we were no good at Spanish either. Deciding on the price to pay him\
  \ almost created a scene as Mrs Fayomi our Chaperon felt the distance was too short\
  \ for the amount he was insisting on. How she couldn\u2019t see that the price is\
  \ fixed based on the kilometer covered is something I don\u2019t blame her for,\
  \ after all such systems do not exist in Nigeria.\n\n We were rescued from that\
  \ black people kind of situation (the caption I got from reading the faces of the\
  \ students waiting to receive us) by the English teacher at the arena. When we stepped\
  \ into the school compound it seemed like an alien invasion situation; the whole\
  \ school were staring at the three black African girls. The only consolation was\
  \ the smile on their faces. Nevertheless I felt like an Ape in a zoo exciting some\
  \ gyptian tourist. But then I was greeted by a kiss on both cheeks by anyone of\
  \ them I met. They asked questions about my nappy hair, they wanted to know about\
  \ Nigeria all at once. They smiled in every picture we took; we were like the stars\
  \ of the school said one of the students.\n\nStruggling through English and using\
  \ Google translators when English failed showed how much they wanted to communicate.\
  \ \nBefore the end of our stay, we taught them our popular shaku shaku hip pop dance\
  \ and we also learnt to tango. I personally got a lot of kisses and many biscuits\
  \ made from their native Afagou. The redness of their faces was an honest way of\
  \ showing how much they would miss us. I left Argentina totally disappointed on\
  \ my black racism expectation. The story I have is one that proves we are all people\
  \ first before any social class that exist in the status quo. How I will love to\
  \ travel more, my expectations are no longer limited to the stories in my home video."
