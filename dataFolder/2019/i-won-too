Text: "I remember I was flexing my toes and trying to relax when I heard about the\
  \ good news: France had just won the 2018 World Cup. My family and I was on a flight\
  \ from San Francisco, California, that expected to land in Paris just an hour after\
  \ the match's end and we had no idea what a \"win\" meant for our trip. \n\nPerhaps\
  \ we could see the festivities that night?\nOr maybe we would buy soccer jerseys\
  \ as our souvenirs?\nIs there a difference in the atmosphere of a country who just\
  \ won a World Cup?\n\nAs soon as we left the airport terminal, we saw Parisians\
  \ everywhere, shouting and drunk, elated at their country's win. We saw grown men\
  \ crying, getting into their cars with their families and friends, leaving to go\
  \ celebrate their country's win. Even the taxi driver we previously hired to take\
  \ us to our hotel called us, inebriated, apologizing for his inability to pick us\
  \ up because, well, he accidentally began partying too early. We laughed, told him\
  \ to stay safe, and found an available driver who said that he would show his patriotism\
  \ later that night.\n\nOnce we had put our belongings into our hotel room, my cousin,\
  \ brother, and I took the metro to the Arc de Triomphe to witness... well, whatever\
  \ there was to witness. Any expectation that I had was exceeded. People were playing\
  \ music from stereos larger than my body. They were standing on the roof of their\
  \ cars and hanging out of windows, waving around the French flag, screaming, \"\
  VIVA LA FRANCE\" on the top of their lungs as they navigated through traffic. Cars\
  \ were honking, fireworks were being set off, everyone was drinking, and I felt\
  \ so blessed to experience this moment with the thousands of people that were all\
  \ around me.\n\nThe next morning, I bought a French flag and I participated in the\
  \ festives with them. I had never traveled to a new country and instantly felt so\
  \ welcomed. It was an indescribable sense of community (which is really ironic,\
  \ considering I barely know how to speak French). I took all my vocabulary from\
  \ my five weeks of crash-course French classes and I found peers who were willing\
  \ to show me their \"local's guide\" to the best places to visit in Paris.\n\nI\
  \ didn't expect that.\nI didn't expect to be experiencing moments that others dream\
  \ of.\nI didn't expect to have the feeling of being \"home\" in a place outside\
  \ of California without even being a tourist first.\nI didn't expect to further\
  \ understand myself and my incessant wanderlust by learning more about others and\
  \ their culture.\n\nYet there I was, une Americaine \xE0 Paris, finding unconditional\
  \ love for this beautiful world by watching the proud camaraderie of a country I\
  \ was beginning to fall in love with."
