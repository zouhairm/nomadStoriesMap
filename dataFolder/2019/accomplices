Text: "\u201CCanarios!\u201D the waiter exclaimed after hearing our standard \u201C\
  dos aguitas\u201D directed toward the wait staff lounging in the doorway. Slightly\
  \ confused, we laughed and said we were Americans. \u201CWell, I\u2019m Puerto Rican,\
  \ a thirsty Puerto Rican,\u201D Vic added to be clearer.\nWe had stopped at one\
  \ of the tabancos or taverns that litter the center of Jerez de la Frontera, Spain.\
  \ Appearing like an oasis among the closed up shops during siesta hours for sweaty\
  \ tourists melting in the heat of southern Spain, it was only meant to be a quick\
  \ break. We needed to get back to our rental a few blocks away where internet and\
  \ tv awaited us with news of Hurricane Maria.\n\u201CAnd so we are cousins then,\u201D\
  \ the disheveled aging man in front of us tried again with an impish grin. His gray\
  \ hair, yellowing teeth and weathered skin were a contrast to his youthful aura.\
  \ But it was his near Puerto Rican accent that intrigued me most coming from a Spaniard.\
  \ \n Diego explained that \u201Caguita\u201D is a way of saying glass of water unique\
  \ to the Canary Islands in Spain. Vic ditched his usual disinterest in etymology\
  \ and began grilling Diego with \u201Cwell then how do you say\u2026\u201D. Soon\
  \ they were rattling off words that were common to both places. A \u201Cguagua\u201D\
  \ is a bus or van and \u201Cchinchoreando\u201D and \u201Cguachincheando\u201D both\
  \ mean hanging out in bars that serve rustic food. Like many Puerto Ricans from\
  \ the country, Diego\u2019s family also whistled a unique tune to call him from\
  \ a distance. A digression into the whistle language culture of the island of La\
  \ Gomera came next.\nTo the casual onlooker, we could have been old friends catching\
  \ up over cigarettes and glasses of the sherry wine that permeates the air here.\
  \ For Diego, our island connection trumped work obligations and formality. \nHe,\
  \ too was a world traveler, he joked. He migrated from the Spanish north coast in\
  \ summer to Andalusia in the early fall and then back home for the winter and spring.\
  \ Offhandedly he said he preferred Jerez for the American tourists who \u201Ctip\
  \ richly\u201D. \nWith a spark of hospitality our waiter realized we had drinks\
  \ but no food. He invited inside the dark tavern to cool off and grab a snack. Needing\
  \ to get back to check on family in the path of Hurricane Maria, we politely declined.\
  \ \n\u201CAhhh\u2026yes! Maria\u2026come this way,\u201D he responded. We collected\
  \ our shopping bags from the stone walkway reluctantly followed his tall frame through\
  \ the arched doorway. In an instant Diego had tuned the radio to the afternoon news\
  \ and laid out plates and utensils at the bar. By the time we had arranged ourselves\
  \ on the wooden barstools a spread of bacalao, olives, cheese, ensaladilla, chorizo\
  \ and sardines was in front of us. \nWith regular updates the hurricane in the background,\
  \ Diego continued explaining that he had hoped to travel more. Unfortunately, an\
  \ elderly mother tethered him to the Canaries. \u201CBut such is life,\u201D he\
  \ sighed with melancholy and resignation. I looked past him toward the young local\
  \ waiters relaxing without a care in the world. I thought it was a shame that they\
  \ let this nice old man do all the work.\nHours later we were high on cheap food,\
  \ hospitality and sherry. As we finally said our inevitable goodbyes, Vic slipped\
  \ Diego a thirty Euro tip with a handshake and warm embrace. He savored the noble\
  \ thought that Diego was saving up wads of colorful Euros in a jar for his family.\
  \ \nAt home a few weeks later, Vic was enthusiastically explaining the Canary Islands\
  \ connection to our family that had taken refuge with us after Hurricane Maria.\
  \ I had to hold back a smile as I watched him finalize his order for a DNA kit.\n\
  What he hadn\u2019t noticed was that our new friend shared his generous tip and\
  \ a cigarette with the other waiters before we even cleared the corner. I noticed.\
  \ However, thirty Euros is a small price to pay for lighting a genealogy fire in\
  \ a skeptic. So I silently applauded the tabanco waiters of Jerez de la Frontera.\
  \ Well played, sirs, well played for us all."
