Text: "Fatefully on my forest trails, a  crazy little boy outside the Danish Folk\
  \ school I attended, proudly showed off his two pox on his chest. He was so smug\
  \ about those pox as if he graduated from circles to the rhombus.\n\nMy friends\
  \ and I planned a weekend trip to Berlin before the incident and there could not\
  \ have been a more eclectic mix of people in a car. It\u2019s like the start of\
  \ a bad joke: What do you call a Hungarian Herpes sufferer ( her eye got infected\
  \ by the wind), a blind Danish woman, a freakishly tall Palestinian man and a sturdy\
  \ Peruvian? The best people you\u2019ll ever meet and the only people you need in\
  \ a crisis like this.\n\nIt started out as a slight rash on my chin which I misdiagnosed\
  \ as an acne outbreak. The next morning, large boils were concentrated on my forehead\
  \ with tiny pustules of fury scattered around my face. I looked at my face in disbelief\
  \ similar to watching a gruesome horror scene - you can\u2019t bear to look, but\
  \ you have to sneak a peek just to make sure the attractive woman is in fact gored\
  \ with a pitchfork and her entrails are lying on the floor.\n As I got dressed,\
  \ more boils and cysts and growths were spread across my stomach and thighs and\
  \ inside err... places. My scalp was filled with them. \n\nAdapt or die. I choose\
  \ death.\nFine, I guess I\u2019ll choose the other one.. \n\nOnce the doctor in\
  \ Berlin confirmed my condition, I was lovingly plastered with calamine lotion by\
  \ my Peruvian friend who was filled with so much sorrow as if I have just told her\
  \ my father died. Every time we made eye contact, her facial expression never seemed\
  \ to waver followed by the words, with a heavy Spanish accent: \u201COh my gah,\
  \ it looks so badt!\u201D  I can\u2019t blame her for her reaction. She wasn\u2019\
  t taught what not to do when adult friend is stricken with Chickenpox.\n\nMy travel\
  \ buddies\u2019 comforting words were met with mixed reviews:\n\u201CDude, you look\
  \ like Scarface\u201D\n\u201CIf you went to a club with me looking like that I would\
  \ want to know you and be near you\u201D\n\u201COh my little brick friend with cement\u201D\
  \n \u201CI\u2019m sure someone has a fetish for that\u201D\n\u201CDude the size\
  \ of this one is insane, but you\u2019re so pretty\u201D\n\nThe following day we\
  \ explored a Jewish Museum and not even Hitler\u2019s tyranny could put my problems\
  \ into perspective. I decided to go back to our hotel and got hopelessly lost.\n\
  \nFirstly I didn\u2019t have a cell phone. Secondly I didn\u2019t know the name\
  \ of the hotel and thirdly, I couldn\u2019t use my feminine wiles because who would\
  \ bed a clay-faced temptress.\n I travelled for what seemed like forever, ordered\
  \ a cappuccino and found an available bench in a crowded courtyard.\nThe masses\
  \ didn\u2019t want to disperse too suddenly because that would seem obvious and\
  \ so I took advantage of this fact and just propped myself next to this old couple.\
  \ Her dentures were close to falling out. \n\nAt this point I was too miserable\
  \ and tired to be concerned with the stares. \n I sipped my cappuccino like a smoker,\
  \ allowing the caffeine to slowly fill my lungs.\nThe dark crept suddenly.\n\nAs\
  \ night fell, a group of cool urban millennials approached me and asked me where\
  \ I\u2019m from. When I told them I\u2019m from South Africa, they hovered around\
  \ me, honoured to be close to a tribal queen. I accepted my servant\u2019s invitation\
  \ to go to a house party that night. \nWhile driving, I spotted my friends walking\
  \ with a police officer. Our car screeched to a halt as I jumped on them in all\
  \ my diseased glory. \nAll was forgiven once the party night started - one of the\
  \ best nights of my life.\n As I donned my tiara on my chalk-white face caught with\
  \ my right hand on green in a 4am Twista wrestle, I realised that what doesn\u2019\
  t kill you makes you a punk-rock tribal temptress."
