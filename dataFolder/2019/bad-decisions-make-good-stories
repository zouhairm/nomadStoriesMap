Text: "My travel story is really a series of short stories from 3 years of living\
  \ on the road throughout Europe... culminating in a existential peak and almost\
  \ farewell to my nomadic lifestyle on a beach somewhere near Lagos (the morning\
  \ I finally, inevitably, woke up in a different town from the one I was supposed\
  \ to be in).\n\nI left 'normal life' for an incredible opportunity - to work as\
  \ a Tour Guide around Europe with a coach company for youth travellers. I spent\
  \ the next 3 years living out of my suitcase, playing the teacher/mentor/mother/friend\
  \ to hordes of young travellers, even though the only real difference between us\
  \ was that I knew more about history and why you should never engage with a selfie-stick\
  \ man in Pisa. They liked to laugh as I sent them off into cities with my favourite\
  \ advice: \"Don't do anything I wouldn't do!\" and then I'd wander off for my own\
  \ adventures (or nap... my greatest nap was a 3 hour one on the cobblestones in\
  \ Piazza San Pietro. Somehow I was neither robbed or kicked out during it).\n\n\
  In a journey that was partly an escape from the average life that I'd never really\
  \ felt comfortable with, and an opportunity to be me with no strings attached, I\
  \ became the ultimate yes-woman. Swim in the Trevii Fountain a la La Dolce Vita?\
  \ Check. Stay up for 3 days in the Berlin clubs? Check. Wander through a foggy Polish\
  \ forest at 1am in the morning by myself? Check. Skydive over the Swiss Alps? Check.\
  \ Explore the ruins of a Latvian prison? Check. Find out that I'm allergic to tomatoes\
  \ at Tomatina? Check? ... okay maybe not everything went 100% the way I expected.\
  \ \n\nThe loneliness of living like a nomad, with people constantly coming in and\
  \ out of your life, sharing amazing moments, but never staying around took its toll.\
  \ A traumatising evening where I was sexually assaulted on the streets of one of\
  \ my favourite cities, and dealing with it by living life even harder was ultimately\
  \ one of the reasons I left the road.\n\nBut overall, I lived the sort of life some\
  \ people only dream about. The highs (sometimes literal) were plentiful, the pinch-me\
  \ moments constant. Being a single woman travelling the world in her mid 20's might\
  \ be a sort of cliche... but the many terrible decisions I made that (mostly) always\
  \ turned out fine...  if nothing else created a repertoire of ridiculous life stories\
  \ for me to share.\n\nI'm good with words. I have a large amount of ridiculous,\
  \ fantastic, intimate, silly, and sweet stories. But whenever I try to write them\
  \ down, I find it hard to figure out how. I can write a chapter or an outline of\
  \ an event, but figuring out how exactly to create the right story-path or narrative...\
  \ that's my struggle. So instead I have random notebooks and journals with snippets\
  \ of what I have to tell, and the encouragement of friends and strangers who tell\
  \ me that if I ever write a book about my ridiculous life, they would buy 100 copies\
  \ (I mean, they obviously won't, but I enjoy the compliment). But this opportunity\
  \ would give me the advice and kick up the backside to finally write down my travel\
  \ story properly."
