Text: "First, let me tell you my story, this journey happened not because I plan it,\
  \ but because I need to. I went to Dubai having a visit visa with 3 months validity\
  \ and to renew it, I need to exit the country. \n\n90 days happened to went on so\
  \ fast, and still not having the luck to get sponsorship for my residence visa,\
  \ boom! This terrific unforgettable trip burst into reality. It felt so surreal\
  \ when I first stepped in Armenia as being born in the Philippines and being a confessed\
  \ fan of just some Asian countries, I barely hear anything about this land between\
  \ Europe and Asia, plus it was really my first time being away with my family for\
  \ almost a week.\n\nThe weather in Dubai when I left was very sunny though it was\
  \ still quite cold as winter was not yet over, but since it's UAE, it will always\
  \ feel like the sun is closer than you whenever you're out. So I was only wearing\
  \ my typical T-shirt, pants, and sneaker on my flight, but then to my greatest regret,\
  \ the chill outside of the airport in Armenia greeted me as the snow was still falling,\
  \ and piles of shaved ice were everywhere. It's wet, people were on their boots\
  \ and gloves, while there I am wearing sneakers.\n\nHowever, as a die-hard fan of\
  \ the series Harry Potter, my heart can't contain itself from my rib cage as I find\
  \ the place similar to the book's setting. The buildings were built in bricks and\
  \ the smell of old magic potion was in the air. I am quite waiting for someone who\
  \ will grab his wand from his pocket and will shout, \"Expelliarmus!\" \n\nEven\
  \ the market place really feels like you're in Hogsmeade, which is why I mostly\
  \ enjoy walking through their alleys at free time, letting me experience what it\
  \ felt like to be transported into the book. You'll see a grandma holding a broomstick\
  \ wearing a typical old brown dress, vintage street lamp post with benches near\
  \ them, and cars sprinting in the high way which looked like from the 1960s.\n\n\
  Our first day was all about paying the lounge in Yerevan and buying the foods we'll\
  \ eat for about 6 days. What was nice in this country, everything was ALL-IN plus\
  \ it was cheap. I'll tell you how they define ALL-IN:  Transportation from airport\
  \ to airport was included in the accommodation with free breakfast; Kitchen and\
  \ laundry were also available; and my favorite, trip packages options with free\
  \ services was also in.\n\nSo as wise as I am, I already paid everything, including\
  \ 3 trips that I and my temporary friends avail. The foods were amazing, and trust\
  \ me when I say their meat and coffee taste deliciously different. It has an authentic\
  \ punch that you'll never have to other places.\n\nArmenia is a Christian country,\
  \ and so it was also their main tourist attraction. Most of our trips were actually\
  \ church visits which were mostly located in higher places, and since mountains\
  \ were close to the sky, you can't expect spring to come easily. But I am such a\
  \ blessed one witnessing how snow melts in stones, and how trees stayed sturdy despite\
  \ the cold. \n\nThe night in Armenia was also bright and lively, as underground\
  \ clubs were on, and most of the wine in UAE came from here, so alcohol was also\
  \ cheap. You can even buy on the street when you go out of the city.\n\nMy last\
  \ day in Hogsmeade was mostly sad, as I realized how fast the day and night comes,\
  \ and I think this was also the point where I started thinking how much of an adult\
  \ I am. Maturity strikes when you are becoming more and more aware of your surroundings.\
  \ Traveling alone really taught me the most important thing a human being should\
  \ carry everywhere, and that is respect, because even if the people are good, the\
  \ place is nice, everything is amazing, you can't describe how happy you are that\
  \ you've got to experience this kind of things, don't forget still that it's not\
  \ your country, so learn to adapt and adjust to everything."
