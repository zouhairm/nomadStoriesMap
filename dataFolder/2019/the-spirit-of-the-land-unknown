Text: "\u201CName the first thing that comes to your mind when I say Kerala, \u201C\
  I said.\n\n\u201CWhat if I told you about a tiny village settled at the foothills\
  \ of Govindmala, known as Payyallore. No backwaters, no beaches; only mountains,\
  \ forests, ancient temples, and so much history. It was so unknown that it was difficult\
  \ to spot on the map.\u201D My friend looked at me in disbelief and started scrounging\
  \ the maps about this land unknown.\n\nThere were still no hotels in this area,\
  \ even after 33 years of my existence. So, you would never know how it was to live\
  \ here. The only information you could get about this place was from the mortals\
  \ who lived here. They were in the last lap of their lives, with their children\
  \ settled far away in the name of opportunities. I was among the few whose aging\
  \ parents were still there, guarding the piety of their ancestral land.\n\n Just\
  \ then, my phone rang and I had to leave my awestruck friend.\n\n\u201CWe might\
  \ have to break the grave of your grandmother buried in the backyard if we want\
  \ to sell the house,\u201D said my mother with a heavy heart. I finished the conversation\
  \ and left the house without saying a word to my friend.\n\n My parents had to sell\
  \ my ancestral home because it was getting too difficult for them to manage. It\
  \ was a weird SOS in my heart. For me it wasn\u2019t a place; it was a feeling,\
  \ a familial one.\n\nI had this \u2018one last time\u2019 panic mode. I wanted to\
  \ revisit all the places that I went to as a child with my grandfather, in fear\
  \ of the inevitable change.\nSo, I jumped onto the first plane to Kochi. Kochi was\
  \ still 136.7 Kilometers to the nearest town from my village. After a 2.5-hour flight\
  \ and a 3-hour taxi ride, I saw the change in scenery once we crossed the Tamil\
  \ Nadu border and entered Kerala. From the dry arid landscape, spluttered with palm\
  \ trees to a more fertile, welcoming landscape laden with greenery, and coconut\
  \ trees. I knew I was coming home.\n \n\nAnother hour and we entered Palakkad district.\
  \ After dodging the messy traffic, humidity and unstable emotions, the taxi took\
  \ the turn from the nearest town, Kollengode towards Payyallore. It was a sloping\
  \ turn from there. It was like going back in time. A long stretch of tarred road\
  \ bulleted with hard, lashing rains. The road down to the village was flanked with\
  \ paddy fields on both sides, prevalent toddy shops and beautiful coconut trees\
  \ intoxicating the whole mood as I drove down. You could see the majestic, pale,\
  \ greyish, blue, colored mountain ranges getting bigger and bigger as you approached,\
  \ waiting with arms wide open and with an assurance that everything would be fine.\
  \ \n\nI took the turn into the lane further inside. I looked on either side, the\
  \ huge mansions covered with creepers eating them from inside and gnawing the emptiness\
  \ in them. I passed by the royal house which was known for its grandeur, its flourishing\
  \ generations. Now it was an empty cloak of sloping roofs shrouded like a pall of\
  \ gloom on the shriveled shoulders of the old caretaker. The people had gone; what\
  \ remained were the cement and stones they had put together. But those inanimate\
  \ objects were the only tie to the living dead in my heart, a connection I didn't\
  \ expect to find. Even in the diminishing light, I could see the stark demise of\
  \ the houses and generations that lived in those lanes. This isn\u2019t how I remember\
  \ Payyallore, my birthplace, the burial ground of my ancestors. \n\nNow it was known\
  \ by the Thirukachamkurishi temple, an ancient place of worship located at the foot\
  \ of the Anamalai range of the Western Ghats. It still held the paintings done by\
  \ my great- great grandfather. The royal family overseeing the temple was trying\
  \ hard to find a balance between sustenance and maintenance of the old-world charm\
  \ of the place.\n\nJust then I knew I had to call my friend, to come to visit this\
  \ place. I was among the few who could still share the spirit of the land unknown."
