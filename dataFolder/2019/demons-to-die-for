Text: "On a lark, I decided to apply for a TEFL program in Thailand. I would go through\
  \ training and be placed at a school, where I would teach English to local students.\
  \ They took my money, and I took my flight. Adventure awaited!\n\nThat was 9 months\
  \ ago and I am soon to be free once more. Today is the last day of my contract,\
  \ and from where I sit in the teachers' lounge, I can see exactly half of graduation\
  \ practice outside. Two lines of children form a channel for older students to march\
  \ through, carrying flags to\u2026 somewhere. The edge of my window interrupts the\
  \ viewing experience. Much like VIP rooms in sports arenas, what I lose in view,\
  \ I make up for in air conditioning. My students drill and follow orders like good\
  \ soldiers, weathering air quality that, at the time of writing, is ranked the worst\
  \ in the world. They all look bored, but I know the truth as well as they do. Even\
  \ this is better than class. As one of their teachers, I can\u2019t help but feel\
  \ the same.\n\nIn short, my job was a nightmare. I taught English to 9  different\
  \ grade levels in a public school with no curriculum and no records of past English\
  \ instruction. My students ranged from the brilliant to the mentally challenged,\
  \ to the violently unstable, to the profoundly uncaring. All of these types of students\
  \ shared a class based on age. Suffice to say, teaching difficulties at this school\
  \ were a reality long before my arrival.\n\nI did what I could. I basked in my small\
  \ victories I found. And I did my job. I drilled vocabulary, and taught sentence\
  \ structures, and invented increasingly outlandish games to captivate the fickle\
  \ imaginations of those age six to fifteen. But it was hard to feel success when\
  \ every day was a colorful demonstration in how little your students cared. Like\
  \ when they would say \u201Cgood morning\u201D to you as they would leave school\
  \ at 4:30 pm. Or when you give a \u201Ctest\u201D that is really just a worksheet\
  \ they already completed earlier that week, and they can\u2019t do it. Or when they\
  \ ask to go to the bathroom and never come back.  All of this culminates in the\
  \ faintest sense what collective disadvantage looks like, and how much of it can\
  \ be forcefully stuffed into a classroom.\n\nThe result of all of this was an unfrilled,\
  \ annoyingly present misery; which was what spelled the end for my 6 predecessors,\
  \ none of whom survived longer than a semester. Stories abound of their unraveling,\
  \ although I only got to hear them as I unraveled myself. I knew I could not continue\
  \ here. I would not quit, but I would not return. This was not worth my happiness.\n\
  \nThat is my calculus for leaving. But it really isn\u2019t my calculus. This is\
  \ the calculus that signed the marching orders for six English teachers. This is\
  \ why there is no curriculum. This is why there are no records. This is why every\
  \ student seems to have a different way to play \u201CHangman\u201D. This is why\
  \ every student knows so many positive affirmations with different accents. This\
  \ is why nobody at this school cares about English. Because why invest in something\
  \ if it isn\u2019t going to invest in you?\n\nMy reverie is ended when a roving\
  \ band of 1st graders knocks on my door, freshly liberated by recess. They gesture\
  \ excitedly for me to come outside. They want me to play with them. They have loved\
  \ me since the first day of class when I laid on the ground to demonstrate \u201C\
  swimming\u201D. My shirt was never the same, but every single one of them still\
  \ knows the word. I am their first English teacher. \n\nI think about next semester.\
  \ I think about leaving all my students. I think about how long it took for students\
  \ to stop calling me Teacher Ben. I pity my successor. Most of them won\u2019t understand\
  \ why it isn\u2019t me. How could they? They don\u2019t see my calculus. All they\
  \ will see is that I didn\u2019t come back, just like everyone else."
