Text: "Once I started my university I always wanted to travel abroad in an exchange\
  \ program, it seemed to be very hard way but not impossible. With a lot of effort\
  \ throughout my degree I could travel to Spain in the most amazing experience ever.\
  \ Madrid was an unimaginable world and I did not know what to expect of it. As I\
  \ was on my own, my arrival was a challenge. Crossing the hole city with two big\
  \ bags of 23 kg each one was very difficult but sweating in the hotter summer I\
  \ arrived to my hostal. I had only 4 days to find a place to live, because after\
  \ those 4 days I would have to attend to the university, a new challenge too. My\
  \ first 2 weeks in the university were to discover the public transport, new people,\
  \ the university, and last my friends through the hole semester. \nTime passed so\
  \ fast and all I could do was to travel around, see new places, new cultures, practice\
  \ my English and learn my degree but in other place. When the winter arrived, I\
  \ didn't expect to feel such that cold, I had not ever lived that before. I was\
  \ so amazed of see how in one place the temperature can drop from 40 degrees to\
  \ 0 degrees. Or the sun hours were reduced. Being in Christmas with friends was\
  \ something really different, we could laugh a lot and enjoy that night with the\
  \ difirent cultures. New year's Eve was incredible as well, being 4 hours in a queue\
  \ to get into the sol's square and at the end enjoy the midnight in the middle of\
  \ a street with a lot of people. To see the snow for the first time made me feel\
  \ so happy. But as everything has its end, I had to return to Colombia, with some\
  \ tears on my cheeks, but really happy of having been in Madrid."
