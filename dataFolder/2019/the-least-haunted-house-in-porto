Text: "Ambling along the rustic boardwalk that hugs the south side of the Duoro River\
  \ in Porto, you could be forgiven for casting your attention only to the other side.\
  \ Lego houses of powder blue and custard yellow, all stacked precariously up the\
  \ scarp. Towering industrial bridges that make you feel as though you\u2019re actually\
  \ living in a Petri dish, and the ship builders who carefully craft modest barges\
  \ to cradle port barrels from the UNESCO listed vineyards of the Duoro Valley, as\
  \ they have for generations. \n\nIt\u2019s February. A fine mist oscillates to plump\
  \ drops and back again, making my hair frizzy and completely unmanageable. The south\
  \ side of the Duoro River details the proud industry that has been looking outwards\
  \ for hundreds of years \u2013 the Atlantic offering fish and a gateway to the prosperity\
  \ of foreign markets. Despite this, the riverfront brazenly details layers of downturn.\
  \ Warehouses of exposed brick continue to wait for their inhabitants to come back\
  \ from that union meeting, despite rocks having violated their windows since the\
  \ 1910s. \n\nPorto\u2019s riverside is gorged with so many significant buildings\
  \ that they simply can\u2019t keep up with how much could be restored. On my right,\
  \ a parking lot with 6 RVs. The owners sip their instant coffee, seemingly unaware\
  \ of the sentry above. A mansion atop the escarpment, rambling vines reclaiming\
  \ the window sills with a colourful tile fa\xE7ade broken into bits. \n\n\u201C\
  How is it,\u201D I think to myself, \u201Cthat a place like this is disregarded\
  \ in plain sight?\u201D In Australia, this mansion would stoke the fires of imagination\
  \ for generations of bored high schoolers looking to light up. \n\nI climb the steps\
  \ up to the back, so used that they\u2019ve been smoothed into waves. Approaching\
  \ the stone and tile stairway that used to humble her guests, I feel a sense of\
  \ apprehension. I can taste metal on my tongue, my skin is prickly like I\u2019\
  ve drunk too much coffee that morning.\n\nEntering the hallway, not one person seeking\
  \ refuge emerges. Instead of being greeted by litter and rubble, the ceiling swoops\
  \ up into a symphony of colour and texture. Abstract frescos of plastic chairs and\
  \ someone\u2019s dog, names in red and blue, parables in Portuguese.  \n\nHow do\
  \ I explain the delight that comes from discovering the opposite of what you expect?\
  \  \n\nProceeding up the internal stairs, I tip toe slowly to avoid the holes where\
  \ the floor has fallen through. My skin continues to prickle, but I feel exhilarated\
  \ to be in this place. The second story has three large rooms with swooping views\
  \ over the river, each featuring new masterpieces. Fine grain line drawings in black\
  \ texter exquisitely detail the curvature of a woman\u2019s nose, depressions of\
  \ her eye sockets and pout in silhouette across one whole wall. More lyrics from\
  \ a Fado ballad across another wall. This broken place is a universe belonging to\
  \ the people who love it from the inside out.\n\nWhat\u2019s next? The third and\
  \ final floor. Expecting to find some kind of resolution that explains how this\
  \ quiet, broken and beautiful place exists, I find a better answer. Plain walls\
  \ here. This story isn\u2019t finished yet. \n\nAnd in this moment, I\u2019m reminded\
  \ of a conversation I first had with the hostel receptionist when I first arrived\
  \ in Porto. I had just passed a series of talented buskers when I arrived. Four\
  \ nose piercings and blue eyebrows, my assumption was that she would know where\
  \ the soul of Porto would be. \u201CAny gigs on this weekend?\u201D \u201CNah, Porto\
  \ isn\u2019t really like that. Not in winter anyway.\u201D Huh? I pressed a little\
  \ harder and she gave me some names to look into. \n\nShe and this house are one\
  \ in the same. A somewhat closed book, until you knock again and they concede some\
  \ of the glimmering energy pulsing underneath.\n\nOf course, this house has many\
  \ stories. While the one I was seeking \u2013 about being forgotten and lost in\
  \ time \u2013 is certainly true, the more immediate story tells of a city whose\
  \ culture grows between the cracks like moss; organic and uncompromising. This is\
  \ a truly old city and despite the ups and downs, its third floor will never be\
  \ a finished work."
