Text: "What is your first thought when you know you are going to Naples for the first\
  \ time in your life? Pizza, Vesuvius volcano, scooters, clothes hanging above the\
  \ street, loud cheerful locals....\n\nMy first impression was far funnier....\n\n\
  Me and my two dearest friends arrived to the airport in Naples on a very sunny warm\
  \ day in October. We were amazed by the weather purely because when we left England\
  \ we left behind all the moist, clouds and breezy breezes. \nExcitement was in the\
  \ air, I couldn't stop smiling. We decided to go by taxi to our apartment in the\
  \ heart of Naples to the \"Spanish Quarter\". Was it a coincident or just a bit\
  \ of luck I don't know, but we got a very entertaining taxi driver with a friendly\
  \ face and a very little English. In the next 5 minutes we agreed on the price and\
  \ we hopped into the back seats and waited to leave the airport....\n\nOur driver\
  \ jumped in the car quickly, he clicked his car seat belt on, switched on the CD\
  \ player, turned the volume up, started the engine and we were off to go to the\
  \ land of unknown....\n\nAfter 10 meter the car has stopped, our driver turned the\
  \ CD player's volume down, turned back to us with a huge smile on, and said: - No\
  \ problemo!\n\nWe looked out of the window, there was many cars trying to leave\
  \ at the same time and they all piled up in a roundabout facing to different directions\
  \ like little matchbox cars after a tornado.\n\nElectric window went down, our driver's\
  \ half body sneaked out of the window and the Italian communication with lots of\
  \ hand movement has started.\nSometimes accidentally or on purpose he touched gently\
  \ the horn front of him to make sure other drivers understood him. After a few minutes\
  \ meaningful discussion our driver has sat back, window went up, just like the volume\
  \ of the 90's top list winner song what was played, engine started again, we sat\
  \ back as well and we were off to go...\n\nAn other 10 meter slow rolling happened,\
  \ and the car has stopped again. Volume down, window also down, driver hang out\
  \ of the car with lots of beeping and talking in Italian and heavily signalling\
  \ with hands. He turned back to us with a proud smile as he thought he solved the\
  \ problem. \n\nWindow up, volume upper, engine start, car moves.... This time we\
  \ moved at least 20 meter. I looked at my friends and happily recognized they had\
  \ a surprised#puzzled#curious#shockedabitbutsmily face as well just like I had.\
  \ This was new to us! we came from the calm and cold blooded England where everything\
  \ is organized or at least look organized. Now we were in the middle of a south\
  \ Italian traffic chaos.\n\nThis time our driver went a little bit further and decided\
  \ to solve the whole traffic problem like a highly qualified traffic controller.\
  \ So volume down, seat belt off, door open, driver out....\n\nHe was jumping, dancing\
  \ and pirouetting between cars screaming and shouting to other drivers and shaking\
  \ his arms in every possible direction just like a maestro of an orchestra in a\
  \ concert. Other drivers to show how much they appreciated his hard work, constantly\
  \ were pressing the horn in different rhythm and they were waving their arms back\
  \ to him with similar \"friendly\" gestures. It was a great performance, a comical\
  \ symphony.\n\nWe sat back with my friends and we enjoyed the show....\n\nFinally\
  \ after a few unforgettable moment our driver managed to move the cars around. A\
  \ minute later he jumped in the car, door closed, seat belt on, volume high up,\
  \ engine start and we got out of the airport like we have never been there. \n\n\
  After all we were excitedly looking forward to the rest of our holiday in Naples....\n\
  \nIs it a story what will amaze and enchant you? Probably not, but maybe it will\
  \ entertain you for a few precious minutes just to imagine the whole situation what\
  \ we went through and maybe it will make you smile. If it so, then it was worth\
  \ to write it. :)"
