Text: "By 2014, I have been to Lisbon for three days and two nights from Paris by\
  \ using Bus. I arrived around 3 am (GMT-1) and need to wait until 6 am (GMT-1) in\
  \ the Bus station before reached the hostel. It was unforgettable and memorable\
  \ trip that I had ever occurred due to I never imagine before that I have an opportunity\
  \ come to Lisbon, Portugal. My mission at that time was about making a local connection\
  \ with indigenous people by learning the language, behavior and culture thru their\
  \ city planning and public station since I am a planner, researcher and architect.\
  \ It was lucky I am because my hostel is nearby with Jer\xF3nimos Monastery. The\
  \ Jer\xF3nimos Monastery or Hieronymites Monastery, is a former monastery of the\
  \ Order of Saint Jerome near the Tagus river in the parish of Bel\xE9m, in the Lisbon\
  \ Municipality, Portugal. In the hostel, I met with a traveler from French and she\
  \ is a writer. Even though I know her only two days during my trip in Lisbon but\
  \ I still keep her well on my Facebook. Her book traveler inspired me very well\
  \ therefore I am getting so excited when we can explore Lisbon together for two\
  \ days accompanied with one of the hostel's owner, we went together for sightseeing\
  \ and did some observation about exploring a correlation from people's behavior\
  \ with city planning include the city buildings characteristics, layout of public\
  \ transport and street shop along the street. I felt that I need come again to Portugal\
  \ because my mission to understand and explore the city, people, culture, food and\
  \ public facilities still need more guidelines thru this writing scholarship. I\
  \ believe that my writing skills will enhance by getting involve for day-to-day\
  \ process of this writing project scholarship due to I can fully immerse participating\
  \ to implement a range of writing services with more well structure and I certainly\
  \ would like to be considered as it truthfully matches my mission and visions for\
  \ my next career goals in 5 years\u2019 time. In my planning, I would like to publish\
  \ a series of research writing observation about a correlation among people behavior\
  \ and local culture with a city planning characteristics and the impact with public\
  \ facilities include the public stations layout. These series would be truthfully\
  \ useful not only for traveler but also for relevant parties such as students, researchers,\
  \ academicians, etc. who interested to understand more about the inter-connectivity\
  \ of circularity from city planning in Portugal. What is the difference the city\
  \ planning in Lisbon with another cities in Portugal and how traveler can find the\
  \ uniqueness easily during in Portugal by using the public transportation? I would\
  \ like to combine my writing with sketch and some of photos then the readers will\
  \ easily to understand and imagine the situations directly before they can see the\
  \ conditions itself by themselves. Some of sketch e.g. commenced from the people\
  \ interactions, city planning looks like, the overview of public stations, food\
  \ and snacks, restaurants and retails, and many more from every single corner of\
  \ the place. I also would like to attach the link video from unique event or ceremony\
  \ that I attended then the reader will get complete of stories about Portugal. Furthermore,\
  \ I would like to bring my writing with more details evidence in example that I\
  \ will attach the ticket prices, a free entry place, and other significant information\
  \ that would be supporting my writing. I am confidence that the style of my writing\
  \ is so unique due to have four combination in one package of stories which contains\
  \ of sketching, writing, photos, and relevant evidence. I also believe that my writing\
  \ stories will useful for movie documentary and not limited for commercial sector\
  \ but also full of education message inside. In conclusion, my last trip in 2014\
  \ to Portugal is still shallow due to I have no experience in writing at that time.\
  \ Lots of great memories need to share with well words and this writing scholarship\
  \ is the key to make it all come true. I do hope I am the one of the lucky winner\
  \ trips and I will commit to write the series stories started from Portugal."
