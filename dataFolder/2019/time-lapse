Text: "Embarking on a solo journey can be daunting. The difference of lifestyles,\
  \ the difference of social norms, and even the difference of what life there used\
  \ to be. The last of those being at the background of my mind, until a budding local\
  \ connection with a man in San Francisco, California USA. For years, I saw pictures\
  \ of the Golden Gate Bridge, and yet for years I kept telling myself that one day\
  \ I\u2019d make the trek. Fast forward into the midst of said trip, and was I ever\
  \ immersed into the city. Walking down the city hills and shoreline, I aimed for\
  \ a beach visit near the Pacific. The simple walk was taking more time than expected,\
  \ with my phone out documenting every uniquely built home and shrubbery around.\
  \ A man quite intrigued by my stop and stares, asks if this is my first visit. Without\
  \ embarrassment of being labeled as \u201Cthat tourist\u201D, I proudly stated yes.\
  \ He then proceeded to tell me how the city has vastly changed since the 1970s.\
  \ Colored with intrigue, I just had to ask why and how, not knowing I\u2019d be\
  \ taken on a time machine back to what the city was before I had ever been born.\
  \ The man started to stroll stride in stride with me down the hill, depicting an\
  \ even more vibrant area. In depth was spoken how the people were more welcoming,\
  \ the parks and fields in abundance of greens, and a booming social setting near\
  \ the beaches. At this point, I stopped once more to take a picture of the sun setting\
  \ along the coast. He admired my fortitude for nabbing the right photograph at any\
  \ time I could. I simply smiled, and stated that I was taking a picture of something\
  \ that surely hasn\u2019t changed since the 70s. As we kept walking and talking,\
  \ I felt my perspective shift off and on between that of a current tourist and a\
  \ critic of what my surroundings might\u2019ve been had this been 50 years ago.\
  \ We finally reached towards the beach shores with the waves crashing towards the\
  \ rocky side. Both giving each other a glance, only to look back at the scenery.\
  \ It was almost as if to communicate through that look, that some natural beauty\
  \ never changes. No matter the decade."
