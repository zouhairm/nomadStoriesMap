Text: "The city of Port-au-Prince welcomed us by hurling our luggage, bursting at\
  \ the seams, into one tap-tap and loading us like packed sardines into another.\
  \ Winding our way through the congested streets, vendors attempted to sell us everything\
  \ from water bottles to windshield washing, chasing after our open-air taxi as it\
  \ puttered along. The steel benches beneath us were severe, the roads jarring, and\
  \ the exhaust fumes sickening \u2013 the stop-and-go of every vehicle forcing us\
  \ to filter the air through shirts and bandanas. Every inch of the street crawled\
  \ with people and vehicles. No traffic lights existed, yet the cohesive understanding\
  \ between drivers rendered them unnecessary. \n\nHours later, fresh air and open\
  \ roads were at our disposal; we had arrived in the mountains. It was night. The\
  \ stars shone brighter than I had ever seen. We pulled up to the church and the\
  \ village of Bellevue greeted us. A flurry of hugs and kisses were exchanged. The\
  \ villagers helped us unload; effortlessly lifting our fifty-pound suitcases and\
  \ placing them atop their heads to carry into the church. A dinner of rice and beans\
  \ was doled out as we set up our cots to collapse into for the night.\n\nThe following\
  \ morning produced a breakfast of eggs, banana, and more avocado than you could\
  \ dream of eating. Coffee in hand, I stepped outside the sanctuary doors to indulge\
  \ in my surroundings. A clear sky, rolling green mountains; a serene blue lake dividing\
  \ two countries - the Dominican Republic mere miles away. Men farmed along the hillside,\
  \ women carried water from the spring, a donkey loaded with goods moseyed along\
  \ the dirt path beside its owner. \u201CBonjou,\u201D we exchanged in greeting.\n\
  \nThe team beckoned \u2013 they had begun unloading supplies \u2013 donation upon\
  \ donation of clothing, backpacks, toiletries, and food were systematically prepared\
  \ for the week ahead. One of our mission leaders, with a heart and a hope for the\
  \ children of Haiti, founded an education program that provides monthly tuition,\
  \ a school uniform and a hot meal each day through sponsor contribution. Fifty pairs\
  \ of shoes, designed to accommodate growing feet, were donated. And it was through\
  \ this donation that my husband, Frank, and I found Kendy.\n\nThe children lined\
  \ up. Shy smiles greeted us. We fitted their sandals \u2013 demonstrating how to\
  \ adjust the straps and hooks. Once every satisfied child had left, just a few pairs\
  \ remained. A teenage boy entered the sanctuary. He motioned to his feet. We asked\
  \ him to sit, removed a sneaker and offered our largest remaining pair. The taut\
  \ straps pinched his skin, his toes buckled in front, and finally we had to deliver\
  \ the news no one wanted to accept \u2013 the sandals were not going to fit. With\
  \ desperate eyes, he lifted the sole of his dilapidated sneaker. A gaping hole revealed\
  \ bare skin, raw and filthy from the earth. My heart sunk.\n\nFrank headed for our\
  \ sleeping quarters. I knew his plan before he returned with a pair of sneakers.\
  \ Kneeling beside the boy, he slipped them on and laced them up. They were a perfect\
  \ fit! Kendy beamed; his smile worth more than a thousand pairs of sneakers. I was\
  \ moved to tears.\n\n\u201CBarbara, is Kendy in the education program?\u201D\n\u201C\
  He\u2019s not.\u201D\n\u201CFrank and I would like to sponsor him. Will you let\
  \ him know he can attend school?\u201D\n\nThroughout the week, we watched as Kendy\
  \ attended lessons. He stayed late every day to catch up on the curriculum he missed.\
  \ At night, when he would play in the streets with his friends, he wore battered\
  \ sandals, but at school he always wore his \u201Cnice\u201D shoes. We wrote him\
  \ a letter; our words of pride translated into Creole. \n\nAs an amazing week in\
  \ Bellevue came to a close, we packed our bags, along with more amazing experiences\
  \ than could possibly be listed. We prepared to say our goodbyes, and there was\
  \ Kendy. He hugged us. He kissed my cheek, then the opposite, then the other, and\
  \ so on until he had me roaring with laughter! One last hug. What a joy to know\
  \ him. I look forward to when we meet again, with a new pair of shoes especially\
  \ for him."
