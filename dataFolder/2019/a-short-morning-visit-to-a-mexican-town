Text: "That Thursday evening I received the call from my father inviting me the next\
  \ day to Ciudad Manuel Doblado. \n\nI quitted my job by the end of December and\
  \ my entrepreneurial  creativity seemed to be stucked by the begining of February\
  \ because I have not finished editing the vision, mission and values for my new\
  \ business, as the digital marketing specialist I hired strongly recommended me\
  \ in our last meeting.\n\nSo, that evening the idea of travelling for free, though\
  \ to a very small town, filled me with enthusiasm. I was certain of something, there\
  \ must be something new to discover in any corner of the planet, or at least I was\
  \ determined to face this opportunity to escape from boredom with all the attitude\
  \ of an XV's  century explorer. \n\nMy father is a doctor and had to visit Ciudad\
  \ Manuel Doblado to perform a surgery, so that Friday as soon as he parked out of\
  \ the hospital I was left alone with two directions: the name of the street \"Rayo\"\
  \ (thunder in English) and that the downtown of the village was located some blocks\
  \ to the West.\n\n\nIt was 9:00 am and I hurried to walk briskly toward downtown,\
  \ eager to discover something to eat for breakfast.\nFour blocks away I arrived\
  \ to a very small square with a kiosko in the center and an old church in front\
  \ of it. Unfortunately there were piles of sand and cement all over the place, it\
  \ was going under maintenance and the church was closed. I felt disheartened thinking\
  \ that if that was the main square of the town, then I had totally miscalculated\
  \ the size of the town, I was expecting a larger place.\n\nDriven by hunger I continued\
  \ walking, another 3 blocks ahead I turned right to a nice paved street with iron\
  \ benches on the sidewalks.  And there I found it the main square with a lovely\
  \ kiosko, many trees, benches, a column made of stone and packed with kids and parents.\
  \ There was a kind of sports competition organized by the school of the town so\
  \ the place was filled with all the joyous vibe from children.  I walked accross\
  \ the square towards a medium church.  I loved the pastel tones of its painted walls,\
  \ the scent of candles litted for the saints and decoring flowers peaced my mind\
  \ and stomach.\n\nGot out of the church and walking again through the square I found\
  \ a small restaurant were I finally had breakfast. By 11:00 I was pretty satisfied\
  \ and continue my strading, some cypresses caught my attention and walked to the\
  \ building where were planted,  I read in the metal plaque hanging on the facade\
  \ of the small and simple building: Library.\n\nAs soon as I got into the library\
  \ I noticed it was really modest, I wondered if I could donate some books to increase\
  \ their stacks. I started looking for something to read, but with low expectations\
  \ to find it.  \n\nSuddenly, I found a real treasure: a collection of 20 volumes\
  \ of Grand Museums of the World, I chose the volume of the Hermitage Museum in San\
  \ Petesburg. I have always dreamt about visiting Russia. Among all the pictures\
  \ shown in the book, beautiful masterpieces painted by European artists, one really\
  \ made me fell in love; painted by Fragonard, \"Stolen kiss\" depicted a girl kissed\
  \ in a very intimate chamber by an admiror, she majestically wears a pearly silk\
  \ dress. \n\nI fantasized of wearing that suntuous dress while walking through the\
  \ aisles of the Winter Palace in San Petesburg.  It is wonderful how this very small\
  \ town helped me to transport myself to the most luxurious palace in Russia. At\
  \ that moment I made a promise to myself I will travel to Russia as soon as possible.\n\
  \ \nI would like to remind me this: never quit to find adventure everyday of your\
  \ life and most importantly be ready to encounter joy and beauty in the most unexpected\
  \ places and in the most unthinkable ways.  This is the secret to keep your heart\
  \ inspired, having a new destination in mind always, no matter how modest the location\
  \ seems and how unplanned the trip started."
