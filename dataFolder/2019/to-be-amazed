Text: "To be amazed. It becames dificult when you travel a lot and have all the information\
  \ on internet. Just some clicks and you can keep up with everything happening in\
  \ the world, all images, people, culture. \nEven though, I am still full of feelings\
  \ while travelling. I love or hate places, I feel astonished by spetacular landscapes,\
  \ I learn, I meet interesing people. But that pure and genuine felling of \"WOW\"\
  \ became rare.\nThen I arrived in Bhutan. A hidden country, so expensive that is\
  \ almost inacessible, simple in everything and everyone. And there, I go deeper\
  \ to a tiny village with only three hundred inhabitants to watch a buddhist festival.\n\
  I appreciate that someone explained before what it was about because seeing that\
  \ men with robes and colorful boots, tents with dragons and serpents stamped, exotic\
  \ flags fluttering in the wind, horses, unknown music and dance, I did not know\
  \ if I had arrived in a new reign of Game of Thrones or in a medieval city, if I\
  \ had travelled in time or space. Earth, 2017, seemed impossible.\nI was arriving\
  \ in a silver SUV and I was sure that I was looking like someone coming from space.\
  \ I had no idea about how to behave. I was solenely introduced to the district government,\
  \ to the farmer that would be my host, to monks with a thousand years and placed\
  \ in a VIP tent to watch the festival while a torrential rain falls. \nThey drum\
  \ beats and they recited mantras in such a grave and vibrant tone that, once again,\
  \ I just could imagine if I were in another planet, with another kind of human beings.\
  \ They were look to me, and I look back, completely breathtaken. \"WOW! WOW! WOW!\"\
  \ What a wonderful thrill took my soul and mind! The indescribable  sensation of\
  \ knowing nothing about that experience and just let my mind capture the unique\
  \ moment. Sitted on a treadmill, I felt extremely welcomed and snug. I felt myself\
  \ a part of that. \nLeaving behind that magical tent, I was taken by mountains to\
  \ the homely farm where I would spent the night. Everything was simple but very\
  \ organized and clean. The pans were shining in order of size together with spice\
  \ pots and other kitchen stuff. Memories of my family invaded me, and again, make\
  \ me felt at home. Of course, all the meals in that place were divine. Who takes\
  \ care of the kitchen like that would never be careless with savours.\nA young couple\
  \ were in the farm to welcome me. They gave me tea and took me to a hot spring,\
  \ where I realized how picturesque were the life there, with this only comunal shower.\
  \ Then the rain gave a break and I could see how beautiful it was around. A huge\
  \ snowy mountain range were iluminated by the full moon. All was peace and nature.\n\
  When the night falls, the numerous family came to have dinner. We all sitted on\
  \ the floor around a small wood burning stove to frighten the cold. Food and a smilling\
  \ baby passed hand to hand, sparkling happiness. They told me that all ingredients\
  \ were from the farm and organic, as everything in Bhutan. They served soup and\
  \ some mushrooms with a cheese so creamy and delicious that even being very spiced,\
  \ I ate again in breakfast. I was again amazed, but now for the food quality, and\
  \ told them that was one of the best meals I had had in my life. \nThey do not believe\
  \ and kept asking me how could it be possible if I had being in so much places.\
  \ I had no words to explain better. They have never being out of Bhutan and had\
  \ nothing to compare with that perfect moment.\nI made an effort to show them what\
  \ was in my heart. Suddenly I was in love with that untouchable place in the end\
  \ of the world. I just guarantee that there are no lies in my words. It was really\
  \ all of that."
