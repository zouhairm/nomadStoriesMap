Text: "I just remember very well two things about that trip. The first one is that\
  \ I was about to miss that plane. And the other, is that in some way it changed\
  \ my life.\nIt was a Friday night, and my flight to Dubai was about to depart from\
  \ Buenos Aires in two hours from the moment in which I arrived at the airport.\n\
  I never figured out why, but everything was extremely busy and messy. I was not\
  \ excited at all, and actually quite demotivated to make that holiday trip. I was\
  \ delayed and the idea of missing the plane,  didn\u2019t matter to me. But I wasn\u2019\
  t alone, my sister was with me to say goodbye. \nWe were having some coffee and,\
  \ the fact is, I was doing nothing to check-in. My sister started feeling uncomfortably\
  \ annoyed and she almost pushed me into that flight. With a firm tone she told me:\
  \ you will be going to the United Arab Emirates tonight, and we will see each other\
  \ again in a couple of days.\nI responded to the pressure and got into the plane\
  \ with total emptiness, not feeling joy or interest at all.\nAfter a first stretch\
  \ of uninterrupted eighteen hours, a layover of eight hours, and another flight\
  \ of two more hours, I finally arrived to the small country in the Middle East.\n\
  From that time, the lack in interest I was feeling, disappeared. I felt comfortable\
  \ immediately and the hunger for adventure mixed with hummus or cinnamon, started\
  \ to govern me again.\nDuring my stay in the UAE, I walked with no rest. Everything\
  \ was surprisingly different to my habitus and my culture but in such a nice way\
  \ that I was speechless.\nHabitus and Culture, both complex terms go with the human\
  \ being wherever the existing body decides to go, and see through its eyes, whatever\
  \ the frame this eyes are trying to see. \nI grew up in a little town two hours\
  \ away from the capital of Argentina. \nWhen I started travelling at the age of\
  \ twenty, I started meeting people from all over the world, and at the same time\
  \ started feeling all their experiences as real life lessons, as new lenses for\
  \ my eyes. \nThat evening near the beach of the Burj Al Arab building, in the beautiful\
  \ neighbourhood of Jumeirah, I made a stop in a cosy familiar restaurant to drink\
  \ some Arabic coffee.\nI took the book I had on my bag, and sat in a table in front\
  \ of the artificial river that crosses the city. A few minutes later, I started\
  \ hearing a loud female laugh. I decided to stop reading my book in order to be\
  \ aware of what was happening in the table where the laughs were coming from.\n\
  Of course I was unable to understand a word of the conversation, both the boy and\
  \ the girl that were sharing some coffee, the table and the conversation, spoke\
  \ in Arabic. But still, I continued looking at them and felt a very powerful feeling,\
  \ something beautiful. Even though I tried to find the perfect word to describe\
  \ that feeling during three years from that moment on, but I never did.\nNevertheless,\
  \ I still feel exactly the same when I remember that magical moment. Before hearing\
  \ the loud laughs of the boy and the girl, I saw them through my Western South American\
  \ eyes, and I saw a black burka with no face or mouth, and a boy perfectly recognizable.\n\
  But when all that silence was magically broken with the musical laugh of the girl,\
  \ I saw the young couple sharing a nice moment with each other, and truly enjoying\
  \ it.\nThe new view that my eyes were trying to capture through the new conceptual\
  \ lenses, was the organic fading off of a cultural prejudice that operated as my\
  \ eyes, until then."
