Text: "Upon arriving to Guatemala City, the polarity between the elites and the majority\
  \ of the population is stark.  The jaundiced, eroding buildings sit on quiet old\
  \ city streets - interrupted by a motorcycle whizzing by, revealing the slogan \u201C\
  Pizza Hut\u201D on its rear.  All throughout the city, such corporations emerge\
  \ ungracefully, revealing the ongoing influence that U.S. corporations have in the\
  \ region. Our taxi driver explains that eating such food is a delight, even considering\
  \ its expense - a delight that many Canadians indulge in due to its cheap price\
  \ and convenience.  While this polarity reveals the staunch and daunting imbalance\
  \ of power in Guatemala, the contrast is vivid with the peaceful, sharing community\
  \ of Nuevo Horizonte.\n\tThe cooperative of Nuevo Horizonte is located in the Northern\
  \ region of Peten and is home to approximately 450 people.  While many families\
  \ occupy the community now, the community was originally inhabited and founded by\
  \ a small group of guerilla fighters and their families who emerged from the jungle\
  \ at the time of the peace accords of 1996.   Tono Figuero, an ex-guerilla fighter\
  \ and leader of the community today says, \u201CThe community is basically a product\
  \ of the peace accords after 37 years of civil war\u201D (2010).  Along with Tono,\
  \ the other ex-guerilla fighters are still extremely important to the cohesion of\
  \ the community as they occupy most leadership roles and symbolize the struggle\
  \ that the majority of Guatemalans experienced during the dark years of the civil\
  \ war.  \n\u2026\nI was lucky enough to be able to interview Tono\u2019s son, Arnulfo\
  \ Figueroa, who is a high school teacher in the community. Arnulfo sees the need\
  \ for enhanced education to ensure that the younger generation does not lose touch\
  \ with the community.  In his opinion, this could be done through a rise in the\
  \ amount of teachers from the community itself and an alteration to the curriculum\
  \ so that it includes more truthful history, as opposed to following the national\
  \ curriculum\u2019s mandate.  Arnulfo is currently teaching them their own history,\
  \ what he calls, \u201Cour real history\u201D but feels as though this approach\
  \ needs to be taken more aggressively.  \n...\n\nDuring our stay in the community,\
  \ a few of us were told a firsthand story by the daughter of an ex-guerilla fighter\
  \ who was killed during the war.  Christina shared the verbal abuse that she experienced\
  \ from her husband, such as him uttering that she was useless.  This abuse was reminiscent\
  \ of her stepmother, who used to physically and verbally abuse her in secret.  She\
  \ said she would go to her room and cry over how much she missed her mother.  When\
  \ she was about 16, her dad tried to set her up with someone else and to avoid being\
  \ forced to be with him, she had a baby with the person she was dating.  Soon after,\
  \ she moved out of her dad\u2019s house to start a new life with her daughter Merlin,\
  \ who was named after her mother.  After escaping the abuse from her stepmother,\
  \ Christina was once again faced with despair when her daughter fell down when she\
  \ was one and her head began to sink in.  In order to get surgery, the community\
  \ helped her out but the procedure did not go well.  A group of Cuban doctors were\
  \ able to fix the complications with her brain.  She says that now, with the strength\
  \ that she has from that experience, she knows she is not useless.  Cristina knows\
  \ she can now survive anything as long as she has Merlin and the support of the\
  \ community.  \n\tChristina\u2019s story demonstrates the utter resilience that\
  \ the people in the community have and the strength that they gain from their hardships.\
  \  It also demonstrates the ability for women to stand up for their rights - facilitated\
  \ by having a support system like the one that the community of Nuevo Horizonte\
  \ provides.  \n\nNote: Academic piece written for undergraduate essay - have since\
  \ published articles, Master's thesis and am producing a documentary, but all revolve\
  \ around political issues and I would love the opportunity to hone my travel writing\
  \ capabilities."
