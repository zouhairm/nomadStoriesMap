Text: "After a long, sun filled day of teaching the English language to Russian-Speaking-Ukrainian-Teenagers\
  \ in Burgas, I made my way up the dusty hostel stairs. After saying goodbye to my\
  \ students, I would go on a lazy walk to the beach, the hidden side, where tourists\
  \ did not really go and only locals sat on the warm sand to anticipate the sunset\
  \ after a busy day. Only after the sun would take a disappearing dive into the sea,\
  \ I would go back to the place I called my temporary home.  Whilst staying there,\
  \ a night had not passed where I wouldn't go to bed with my imagination filled with\
  \ the tales told by the fellow travellers, the nomads, who stayed at the same place.\
  \ I would meet them, and learn about their life lessons provided by their uncountable\
  \ travels, in the upstairs area; the open kitchen, more precisely. Which is where\
  \ I encountered the protagonist of this story, old Janek. In retroperspective, I\
  \ would compare Old Janek to some sort of a mystically magical creature, such as\
  \ an elf. He was 76 years old, significantly older than everyone else I have met\
  \ at the hostel. His simple wisdom was conveyed through carefully chosen, yet poem\
  \ like flowing words. It felt as if he was filled with the wisdom of the ancient\
  \ tales. \nI observed him cut small vegetables into a single, beaten up pot, an\
  \ action he made with precise, slow, focused movements. Softly, I asked\n\"Where\
  \ are you from?\"\nWithout breaking the chop..chop..chop rhythm, he began his story.\n\
  \" I was born in Warsaw 1942. I grew up amid confusion, my family consisted of people\
  \ which reminded me of puzzle pieces attempting to fit back into a picture which\
  \ was impossible to be really constructed again.So I began to search for a means\
  \ of escape from the unspoken sadness; I found it in the Philosophy, Eastern Philosphy\
  \ to be precise. I could only find out as little as the pre-war books that have\
  \ remained could tell me, yet I knew I was hooked. It became my purpose to educate\
  \ myself further. Meanwhile, I managed to escape to Canada when I was 23, where\
  \ I got payed to become an aerodynamic enginner. For 10 years, I was payed well,\
  \ fed well, and believed I was happy. But my soul knew otherwise. I yearned to be\
  \ spiritually fed, not just physically. So I escaped again. This time, to South-East\
  \ Asia. Name a country in that part of the world, and I will tell you the name of\
  \ the village, of the mountain, where I lived, meditated, worked, and learned. I\
  \ now know what the true definition of Light is. I have traced my fingers among\
  \ the lines of Nirvana, or Enlightment, or whatever you want to call it. After over\
  \ 40 years, my soul is finally at the state of peace that allows me to comprehend\
  \ the world in the wonderful spectrum of colours, philosophies, melodies and voices.\
  \ So truth be told, I cannot truthfully say I one from one place.\"\n\"How so? Still,\
  \ is not the answer simply Poland?\"\n\"Righfully, my heritage is from Europe. Mentally,\
  \ I feel like I should say I am from Asia, where I learned how to live in accordance\
  \ of my soul. Yet my life's adventure really began in North America.\"\nEach of\
  \ these continents have shaped his being, his life story. Which part of this story\
  \ is the most significant? The beginning, middle, or the end? How can one determine\
  \ which mistake or choice was the determing factor that had influenced us mostly\
  \ in future decisions? \nJanek continued.\n\"The question of where I am from is\
  \ merely another way of asking \" Who are you?\". And that question my dear, I have\
  \ been asking myself for 76 years.\"\nChop..chop..chop.\nI didn't expect such a\
  \ casual question to confuse my way of thinking, nor did I expect his answer to\
  \ meddle with my personal sense of identity. However,  encountering a fellow immigrant\
  \ with a medley of cultural identities reassured me, an immigrant child,  that the\
  \ lack of feeling of belonging no longer had to be something shameful. No no, it\
  \ is only a part of my life's tale."
