Text: "Spending Christmas sipping cocktails on the beach in Bali with my sister -\
  \ idyllic right?  Just what the body needed after a manic few months at work and\
  \ one of the coldest, windiest New Zealand springs on record.  \nWell apparently\
  \ drunk me didn't agree.  My sister and I hadn't spoken in a while. We caught up\
  \ on Skype mid-work-christmas-party after a solid few hours of free champagne -->\
  \ both high on life and bulletproof.  \n\"Three weeks on a beach??? \" \n  \"We'll\
  \ be bored out of our minds\" \n    \"Doesn't sound intrepid\" \n      \"Where is\
  \ the epicness?\" \n         \"Indo is huge,  so many options\" \n            \"\
  Let's check out the other side of \n             the country\" \n              \
  \ \"Well what do you know,  there \n                 are flights to Indonesian Papua\"\
  \n                  \"DIVING ... \"\n                     \"BIRDS OF PARADISE\"\n\
  \                       \"Book it! \"\n                         \"BOOOOOK IIIIT\"\
  \nNothing sobers like the harsh light of day and a non-refundable flight confirmation\
  \ in your inbox. \"Sisterina ... What the hell did we do? We were supposed to be\
  \ sunning ourselves in mild luxury and instead were headed to the jungle?\" Just\
  \ roll with it, I was told.  Not a surprising response from her since we both knew\
  \ that I was going to be the one to dig our way out of this mess.  Between meetings\
  \ I frantically searched for accommodation and dive options in our budget.  Nothing!\
  \  Days...  DAYS of searching the dark reaches of Google results (I'm talking page\
  \ 15 people)  and I finally found a blog no-one seemed to have read on shoestring\
  \ travel in the island of Raja Ampat, West-Papua. The post listed the mobile numbers\
  \ of island villagers who offered homestays and backyard diving from fishing boats.\
  \ \nPretty much exactly what we were looking for,  except we needed a registered\
  \ dive outfit for our insurance to hold.  \"Send them a text\" it said...  \"in\
  \ Indonesian Bahasa if not a local pidgin\". Brick wall.  No Indonesian dialects\
  \ in my arsenal unfortunately.  \nNot to be put off I messaged the dates and simple\
  \ requests for a stay to all those families on islands that offered fancy dive Operations.\
  \  Within a few days responses started trickling in...  \"You stay\" \"My home\"\
  \ \"Bed Sleep\". \nClosing the most intelliagble response I let the family know\
  \ which date we would take a ferry from the airport town of Sorong, after two flights,\
  \  and overnight stay in the unbelievable ***hole of Makassar and a taxi ride to\
  \ the port in a vehicle held together by chewing gum (or so it seemed).  This would\
  \ take us to a main island in the atol, but hours away from the island we were supposed\
  \ to stay on.  \nI could do no more for the time being.  \n\nCome Christmas time\
  \ we luxed out in Bali,  raced around the neighbouring island of Lombok on scooters\
  \ and generally tried to keep any anxiety over our Papua trip to a minimum.  \n\
  Our connections to Raja Almost certainly met the intrepid criteria.  On the way\
  \ we picked up a crazy Swede with less of a plan than we had - and made it to the\
  \ ferry.  I was too nervous to take any congratulations as yet.  There was next\
  \ to nothing at the ferry port.  How were two half intelligible text messages going\
  \ to work???  We alighted on the crumbling platform,  surrounded by jungle and a\
  \ few fishing boats that had hastily made space for the gargantuan soviet-looking\
  \ cargo ferry. \n\nAlright,  we were here.  Now what.  Food bundles were collected\
  \ by the locals.  The odd passenger was whisked away in a fancy speedboat.  The\
  \ three of us edged our way between the cargo to the fishing boats - looking helpless\
  \ and very much lost.  Our saving grace actually.  Our host had found the ferry\
  \ time through what we subsequently understood to be a deeply efficient and effective\
  \ exchange of information between fishermen who shot between islands like a telephone\
  \ network.  He sidled up to us,  smirked at our bunny-in-the-headlights look that\
  \ singled us out as his guests.  Then whisked us away to the most perfect little\
  \ bungalows,  on the most perfect little island you can imagine - all white sand\
  \ and palm fringed,  surrounded by the best diving we had ever experienced.  \n\
  This trip completely changed our mantra - we now only travel to places that scare\
  \ us!"
