Text: "Budapest, end of January, it's snowing, my friends and I just arrived and we\
  \ all want to eat. The bus left us in the center of town, in front of the Great\
  \ Synagogue, the biggest in Europe, we can also see a big wheel overlooking the\
  \ town, everything looks traditional and pretty nice. As we were going to our appartements\
  \ we stopped in a local fast food, and tried a speciality : a langos (a salty donut\
  \ with cream and cheese). It was a bit fat but sooo tasty.... I absolutely liked\
  \ it. \nIt was around 6PM and it was already dark outside, we still decides to hang\
  \ out a bit to discover this unknown town. Our street was not well lighted but we\
  \ entered in a pedestrian street and it seemed to be another world. There were colored\
  \ light strings everywhere, the street was full of restaurants and bars which were\
  \ overcrowded, it was cold but nobody cared about it. We decided to stop there to\
  \ enjoy the atmosphere. After an hour or two we went back to our place and slepped\
  \ to be able to wake up early in the morning. \nThat's exactly what we did. We woke\
  \ up around 8AM, got dressed warmly, took a breakfast and went out. Everything was\
  \ white, it was still snowing and the air was fresh but it wasn't unconfortable.\
  \ We went on higher grounds, there was a kind of castle there, it was made of white\
  \ stones and everything was open. The view over the town was incredible : bridges,\
  \ traditional houses, churches, synagogues, a huge food market, the yellow tramway...\
  \ I felt transported into another era : the snow, the silence, the view and the\
  \ surrounding, I had no words, it was a very special time. \nAfter, we went to eat\
  \ in the food marker, I tried another speciality : the Poutine. It's a kind of soup\
  \ with pieces of meat, potatoes, and vegetables. I liked it but not as much as the\
  \ langos. \nThis afternoon, we decided to sleep for an hour and then to go to the\
  \ ice rink. But the ice rink we went to was a bit special because it was outdoor\
  \ in a very beautiful place : a lake near by a castle. It was magical, the night\
  \ came out ant all the monuments were lighted, there was some music on and it was\
  \ still snowing. My ice skating was not very good but I still felt like an artist.\
  \ We stayed there for a few hours and came back to our appartement to eat and sleep.\
  \ \nThe last day, we went to the bath and just enjoyed quietly. The bath we went\
  \ to were huge, the outside pool was my favorite. It was so warm we can observe\
  \ some smoke getting out of the water and flying in the air. The place was old and\
  \ very charming. There was statues and fountains, the ground and the walls were\
  \ made of tiles, everyone was talking quietly so we that we can enjoy the sound\
  \ of water. We could have stay there a full day, but we had to go and make our suitcases\
  \ because it was already time to go back home."
