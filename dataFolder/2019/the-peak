Text: "\u2018I will either pay for a flight lesson for you locally, or you can come\
  \ over to Alaska and we will fly up into the mountains and do yoga on the glaciers.\u2019\
  \ \n\nI was in my mid 50s. My marriage had ended, my parents had died, my daughters\
  \ had left home. I knew I needed to do something to refresh - this was not what\
  \ I was expecting. \n\nThe screen blurred as tears filled my eyes. I hit the comment\
  \ field and typed \u2018I\u2019ll come to you.\u2019\n\nTwo months later I was beside\
  \ the pilot flying out of Valdez and up toward the Columbia Glacier on our way for\
  \ a yoga photo shoot. We went low over ice floes where seals rested and then flew\
  \ over the Glacier itself. Over the great cliff of ice where it meets the sound.\
  \ We saw massive chunks of ice break free and fall, sending great waves far across\
  \ the bay. \n\nWe landed down on a black sand beach and set up. Camera gear and\
  \ outfits came out and we scouted around for the best icebergs and angles for our\
  \ shapes. I remember being in a deep back bend and feeling the sun shining on my\
  \ chest and face, I closed my eyes and I could hear the cracking of the ice and\
  \ the tinkling as the drops from the melting icebergs landed in the water. When\
  \ the sun moved and the tide came in we hopped back in the chopper to go to another\
  \ beach where the conditions and lighting were better. And so we set up again, and\
  \ a quick change of active wear, and did our search for the best rock or iceberg\
  \ for our poses. We laughed, fell over, adjusted and did it all again. Hour after\
  \ hour. \n\nAs the day wore on and it was time to head back to base, we loaded up\
  \ again and set off. We went back to town the back way, snaking up deep valleys.\
  \ \u2018Here your turn\u2019. I was being handed the controls. Me, who had trouble\
  \ parking my Fiat. My brain nearly melted. I took the controls in my hand and made\
  \ small adjustments, left, right forward, back. I felt the chopper slowly respond.\
  \ It was a bit like riding a unicycle. Or like holding a handstand, when your point\
  \ of balance is a tenuous thing and you need to make constant adjustment to maintain\
  \ the balance and not to fall. But this was so far to fall! I keep over correcting\
  \ but gradually began to get a sense of it. What an extraordinary thing to have\
  \ this control in the palm of your right hand. \n\nI had always dreamed of being\
  \ able to fly. Of being able to pick myself up and soar up a valley just to see\
  \ what was there. And here I was. I was so overwhelmed I could hardly think. And\
  \ then we manoeuvred onto the highest peak and the pilot gently set us down. We\
  \ scrambled out of the chopper and out onto the snow. As far as I could see, all\
  \ the way to the horizon, in every direction were snow capped peaks, with glaciers\
  \ snaking down the valley between them. \n\nI found the highest rock and I balanced\
  \ on my hands. I felt the enormity of the space around me, the wind buffeting me,\
  \ the others laughing and cheering. It was a peak pose. On a peak. At the peak of\
  \ a transformative experience."
