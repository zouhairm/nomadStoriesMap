Text: "We hadn't seen each other in five years.  She was my flat mate on Borgo Pinti\
  \ street, while studying abroad in Florence Italy during a sweltering summer.  Claire,\
  \ hailing from Boston, had just graduated from Harvard and asked who would travel\
  \ with her via a social media post.  I responded to her post with an affirmative\
  \ \"let's do it,\" and that was it.  Planning a trip through Europe had officially\
  \ begun from that moment on.  During the coming months Claire and I corresponded\
  \ back and forth sending flight information exchanging leads on where to stay and\
  \ what to see.  Claire liked to plan more daily details,  I was intent on a general\
  \ plan--figuring out the rest when I was there.  I wanted to challenge myself though\
  \ going head first into the unknown.  \n\nA few months thereafter, the adventure\
  \ looked me square in the face.  Sitting in one of the last rows on the plane, a\
  \ bit too close to the lavatories, It was the first time I had experienced anxiety\
  \ over flying.  My flight was two hours delayed in leaving. Some of that time involved\
  \ being stuck on the tarmac.  A flight attendant took pity on me and kindly offered\
  \ me a glass of red wine at no cost.  Her simple kindness eased my nerves, but yes\
  \ I did also accept the glass of wine.  Quietly,  I eased through it, knowing that\
  \ once I got there it would somehow work out.  I knew where both Claire and I were\
  \ staying in Montmartre, and I knew I would get there eventually.  I just hoped\
  \ she wasn't worried. \n\nSince I had left my cell phone at home in an effort to\
  \ disconnect, all I really could do was hope and trust it would all work out.  I\
  \ anxiously  got off the plane and took the train into the city.  Suddenly a wave\
  \ of near panic swept over me.  I couldn't figure out which bus to hop on to get\
  \ to the hostel.  Would Claire be there?  Is she worried?  The confused exhaustion\
  \ of traveling across seas had gotten to me.  My mind went haywire.  \n\nIt was\
  \ time to focus.  I had a map, and I had learned a few words of French to be courteous,\
  \ but people scoffed at me as I tried to seek help to point me in the right direction.\
  \ Either that, or they just straight up ignored me.  I was wheeling my little carry\
  \ on suitcase over the bumpy roads and sidewalks with a map in my other hand and\
  \ a look of worry on my face.  It was obvious I was not from around there.  Wandering\
  \ in what I hoped was the right direction, I suddenly was approached by a young\
  \ man who had noticed me asking for directions.  He spoke English!  Not only did\
  \ he speak English but he wanted to help me!  \n\nSure enough he lived in Montmartre,\
  \ where my hostel was situated and knew exactly the place.  Off we went!  He took\
  \ my arm and guided me along the street. Not being quite sure if I could fully trust\
  \ him, I insisted on towing my own suitcase as we hurried along.  He talked and\
  \ moved fast.  He pointed out general areas of the city and places he recommended\
  \ along the way.  \"Come this way, I want to show you something special.\"  I stopped\
  \ dead in my tracks, \"what, where the hell are you taking me? I have to go meet\
  \ my friend who is waiting.\"   He insisted and I protested, but finally he convinced\
  \ me. It was still light out, there were people around.   I followed him along a\
  \ side road  that wasn't as populated and my nerves were tense.  \n\nWe rounded\
  \ a corner and there was a little waterfall on a park hill, it was actually lovely.\
  \  \"see, I told you it was special.  now we go to find the hostel.\"  Off we went.\
  \  Another couple blocks and we stopped in the road partition.  He pointed across\
  \ the street,  \"there is your hostel.\"  I saw the sign, looked below and there\
  \ was Claire having a cigarette, waving at me.  He gave me a kiss-kiss and bid me\
  \ farewell.  I had arrived in Paris."
