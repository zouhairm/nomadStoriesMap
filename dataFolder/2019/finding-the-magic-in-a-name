Text: "The sword was gleaming in the full moonlight as it was pressed against both\
  \ my shoulders, one at a time. Each woman, all six of them, passed the sword between\
  \ them and each knighted me with my new chosen name: Bolt. I was kneeling before\
  \ them on a cool summer night in Wolf Creek, Oregon, at a \u201Cfairy sanctuary\u201D\
  \ for gay and trans men. I had heard of these safe spaces that were set up since\
  \ the 70's to create a sense of belonging, but didnt realize it would end up allowing\
  \ me to make space to belong to myself. Taking on a chosen name was my way of reclaiming\
  \ my sense of self.  It was then I realized that taking up suggestion to attend\
  \ this radical reclaiming witch camp from a girl I randomly gave a rideshare to,\
  \ was going to be something special. \n\nIt was the third day into the camp and\
  \ we were instructed to create affinity groups and create our own rituals or ceremonies.\
  \ A bunch of us had been hanging out on the smoking porch and we decided to team\
  \ up and have a thanking ceremony for Bumblebee. \nAmong the damp and wild grasses\
  \ of sanctuary were a number of handmade altars  created in memory of past members\
  \ and friends of the space.  Bumblebee was a bright creative force who used to aggressively\
  \ smoke cigarettes on that very porch. We felt it was only natural that we would\
  \ make a thanking ceremony for him by leaving little stones and tobacco it his black\
  \ and yellow painted alter. Plus, a naming ceremony for ourselves.\n \n \nThe sword,\
  \ now clasped in the hands of six new friends who also wanted to change their names,\
  \ was hidden element inside a cane with a plastic rams head on it. A \u201Cpocket\
  \ trade\u201D at the Rainbow Gathering just three days before, the sword would forever\
  \ bind us to that moment. Breathing in that warm summer air and feeling the intimacy\
  \ of the moment I took a meditative moment to soak it all in and be thankful for\
  \ the unexpected  but cathartic experience. \nTwo weeks later I was back at the\
  \ Wolf Creek Sanctuary to hitch a ride down to San Francisco with a couple driving\
  \ down to be vendors at a leather convention in the city. I was trying to get back\
  \ to my boats in the bay after my car had broken down days before. So I was more\
  \ than grateful to have these new friends lending me a lift down the 101 but their\
  \ car was not in the best shape either. So after several AAA tows over two days\
  \ we finally made it to San Francisco. Weary from the travel, the couple offered\
  \ to let me regain my strength with some tea inside their friends house before I\
  \ headed down to the marina. \nThe house I recognized from other friends of mine\
  \ pointing out they knew someone there but I couldn't remember who. We knocked on\
  \ the door and appeared a 300 lb woman with a blue beard tattooed on her face. She\
  \ smiled excitedly at us and hurried us into hery cozy dwelling. Her name was Wolfy\
  \ and while drinking the mint tea she had prepared,  she motioned for me to join\
  \ her in the next room. I walked into a large space lined with built-in bookshelves\
  \ encircling a bed and desk near the window. \nWolfy gingerly pulled several black\
  \ stones out of a box on one of the shelves and held them in her hand. She looked\
  \ at me earnestly and told me she had a friend who she help nurse in that room through\
  \ their unfortunate struggle with HIV. Before they passed away, they gave her those\
  \ stones and instructed her to give them to people she thought they would be friends\
  \ with if they were still alive. \nSomehow, even though just meeting me for the\
  \ first time, she felt I would be one of those people they would have gotten along\
  \ well with. Honored by the gift of these little black tourmaline stones, I asked\
  \ her what her friends name was. She told me his name was Adam but everyone called\
  \ him Bumblebee."
