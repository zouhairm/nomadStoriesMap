Text: "\u201CYou will be our first guests,\u201D read her email.   \u201CThe first\
  \ guests of the season?\u201D I replied hopefully.  \u201COur very first guests\
  \ and we are so excited,\u201D declared Assuntina.    This is how I became known\
  \ as \u201CLa Prima Ospite\u201D (the first guest) at a family-run agriturismo in\
  \ a small village north of Rome. \n\nPlanning my first trip to Italy 15 years ago,\
  \ I decided to attend a cooking school.  As I was researching possibilities on the\
  \ internet, I came across an appealing website for Fontana del Papa in Tolfa, Italy.\
  \   I began corresponding with Assuntina, the owner.   The rates for the week were\
  \ all inclusive and quite reasonable so I decided in February to book our stay in\
  \ June.    Assuntina could not have been more accommodating.  No deposit was required\
  \ \u2013 we could pay when we got there.  Although not in the official itinerary,\
  \ she agreed to arrange for a mountain bike and some Italian lessons for my traveling\
  \ companion who was not as keen on the cooking aspect of the trip as I was.  No\
  \ request was denied.  In retrospect,  I suppose I should have not been surprised\
  \ when a few weeks before our departure she let on that we would be their very first\
  \ guests.  \n\nWe arrived in Rome and rented a car for the hour long drive to Tolfa.\
  \   It took a bit of navigating to find Fontana del Papa.   We stopped for directions\
  \ in the town but none of the locals spoke much English nor did they seem to know\
  \ anything about an agriturismo in the area.   Driving back down the mountain from\
  \ the village without a clue of where we were going,  I started to think that perhaps\
  \ I had been duped or that I had imagined my long correspondence with Assuntina.\
  \  Gazing out the window, exhausted and close to tears, I saw a familiar image on\
  \ the horizon.  Yes, this was definitely the house pictured in watercolor on Assuntina\u2019\
  s website.  We pulled into the unmarked driveway located off a treacherous curve\
  \ in the road and parked the car in the field below.   \n\nWe walked toward the\
  \ stone farmhouse.  Seeing no one, I called out announcing our arrival.   Strangely,\
  \ we saw a variety of kitchenware and furniture all laid out on the grass.   Suddenly\
  \ an aproned woman, who was nearly covered in dirt from head to toe, appeared and\
  \ cried out \u201CMegggga!\u201D and I was enveloped in my first Italian abbraccio.\
  \  Following right behind were her husband, two of her children, a couple of barking\
  \ dogs and some squawking chickens, each with their own greeting for us.  She proudly\
  \ proclaimed that they had just finished installing the kitchen.  We were invited\
  \ to settle into our rooms and rest while they retrieved all of the kitchen items\
  \ and finished assembling what became our cooking school for the week. \n\nI could\
  \ have easily cancelled the trip when I heard the \u201Cfirst guest\u201D pronouncement\
  \ since I had not paid a dime before our arrival.   But I felt that it could be\
  \ a really special experience and it was.    We were not only the first guests -\
  \ we were the only guests that week.  We became part of this wonderful family and\
  \ not just for the week.  We cooked, we ate, we laughed.  We learned a lot about\
  \ wine and a bit of Italian.  Sometimes we were sent to pick herbs from the organic\
  \ garden or to retrieve the laundry fresh from the line.  Curious relatives from\
  \ nearby towns dropped in to meet the crazy Americans who came to visit the then\
  \ unknown Tolfa.   On our first visit to town for an authentic gelato, it seemed\
  \ as if every citizen turned up in the piazza to check us out and not so subtly!\
  \    We got a true taste of what it\u2019s like to live in a small village where\
  \ everyone knows everyone.  I learned two important travel lessons \u2013 to be\
  \ flexible and to go as local as possible.   Although it was my first visit to Italy,\
  \ it truly seemed like I was at home with family.   I have returned several times\
  \ to a now very successful agriturismo and I am always introduced to other guests\
  \ as La Prima Ospite!"
