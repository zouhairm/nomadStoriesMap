Text: "Even when we travel alone, it's the people we meet along the journey that can\
  \ make it something special. \n\nAs I write, I'm in Bogota, the capitol city of\
  \ Colombia, and I'm experiencing that something special right now. \n\nBogota is\
  \ a sprawling metropolis of over ten million people . It is home to amazing historical\
  \ and cultural treasures including many world class museums, ancient colonial streets,\
  \ buildings and churches. \nBut that's not what this story is about. This story\
  \ is about the most amazing, warmest and welcoming people I've ever met.\n\nColombia\
  \ is a Spanish-speaking country. In order to enjoy this trip to the fullest, learning\
  \ to speak Spanish was important to me. I found a language exchange partner who\
  \ lives in Bogota and together we worked on haring our languages for a few months.\
  \ \n\nUpon arriving at the airport in Bogota, there she was, along with her husband,\
  \ to welcome me and take me to my hotel. That was just the beginning. \n\nOver the\
  \ following days, I visited many cultural and historical gems, wandering around\
  \ the fascinating neighborhood of La Candelaria and visiting some of its spectacular\
  \ museums and sites with my friend and several of her cousins. Together we explored\
  \ the Botero Museum, home to a massive collection of art work by Colombia's most\
  \ famous artist, as well as works by Picasso, Dali and countless others. We also\
  \ spent a day at the Museo de Oro, the Gold Museum, which has over 5000 articles\
  \ on display. It's  very impressive. The National Museum of Colombia was another\
  \ highlight I shared with my new group of friends, which by this point now numbered\
  \ seven. But still, this was just the beginning. \n\nEvery day we were in contact,\
  \ sometimes just a quick message to see how I was doing or what the plans were for\
  \ the day, but mostly it was about making plans together. One night our entire group\
  \ even went bowling. A wonderful evening spent with new friends.\n\nIt was the weekends,\
  \ however, that took it to a completely different level. Parties that went on well\
  \ into the morning.  Road trips to small towns in the countryside, such as Sibate\
  \ and Alberguez.\n\nTraffic in and around Bogota is terrible, a near permanent traffic\
  \ jam, despite the fact that people are restricted from driving on certain days\
  \ due to restrictions intended to reduce traffic in the city. It doesn't work. At\
  \ all. The 27 kilometer drive to Sibate took about 90 minutes.\n\nSibate was a true\
  \ Colombian food experience as we shared a massive platter with different types\
  \ of potatoes, platano, arepas stuffed with cheese, yuca and several meats including\
  \ ribs, hen, chorizo sausage, a sausage made of blood - I didn't try that - and.....wait\
  \ for it..... cupybarra - one of the largest rodents in the world. It tastes kind\
  \ of like pork. The day trip concluded with fresh, delicious strawberries and cream\
  \ just a bit further down the road.\n\nAlberguez was easily the highlight of the\
  \ trip. There, a few hours out of Bogota, was my new friends' family property. The\
  \ weekend started with a great game of tejo, \nColombia's national game, in front\
  \ of a huge crowd of 30 or 40 people. It's a fun game that involves throwing a metal\
  \ disc at a board filled with mud or clay. The objective of the game is to get the\
  \ disc into the pipe set in the middle of the board, or to explode the little packets\
  \ of gunpowder set around the pipe. An incredibly enjoyable game.\n\nEverybody playing\
  \ and watching the tejo games were family of my friends. Parents, uncles, \xE0unts,\
  \ cousins and nieces. The entire group returned to the family property  for a night\
  \ of dancing and drinking Poker, a Colombian beer, and aguardiente, a delicious\
  \ sugar cane liquor flavoured with anise. Again the party continued deep into the\
  \ morning . Sunday was more tejo and home cooked meals and then back to Bogota.\
  \ \n\nThese are just a few of the family events I was invited to share. Thanks to\
  \ these wonderful, sincere and gracious people, I've enjoyed the most amazing travel\
  \ experience, and begun many new friendships that I cherish. It's been the real\
  \ Colombian experience, with special Colombian people."
