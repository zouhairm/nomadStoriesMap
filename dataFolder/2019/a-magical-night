Text: "It was nearly three am and a child and a petite elderly woman were playing\
  \ tug o\u2019 war with my arms. We were dancing, to use that term loosely, with\
  \ our arms interweaved together, hips swaying gently, and feet rhythmically stomping\
  \ forward and skipping backwards. Every now and then, the group abruptly changes\
  \ direction to mix things up (sometimes it takes a while for the other half to catch\
  \ up, which explains the tug o\u2019 war). \u201CThree more hours,\u201D I thought,\
  \ as I gratefully accepted a cup of what I thought was water but was actually potent\
  \ rice wine. \n\nI was at Pas-ta\u2019ay (\u77EE\u7075\u796D), the Ritual to the\
  \ Short People, a biennial ceremony held at the mountainous area of Nanzhuang Township\
  \ in Miaoli County, where the Taiwanese indigenous tribe Saisiyat (\u8D5B\u590F\u65CF\
  ) dances continuously from sundown to sunrise to remember and appease the Ta\u2019\
  ay tribe (\u77EE\u4EBA\u65CF). The Ta\u2019ay, though tiny (they were allegedly\
  \ shorter than 90cm), could snap people\u2019s necks at a 180\xB0 angle, and more\
  \ pertinently, knew witchcraft and had cursed the Saisiyat with no harvest unless\
  \ they internalise their teachings and commemorate them. \n\nThe wistful humming\
  \ of the same few verses by the group was supposed to be just that; a quiet reflection\
  \ of their past misdeeds, and the uniformity of movement a display of harmony and\
  \ unity. But the solemnity was undercut by the loud clanging of bronze bells attached\
  \ to the dancers' hips, and for me, the smell of Taiwanese sausages wafting from\
  \ makeshift stalls\u2026\n\nSo I caved in. I sheepishly apologised to the elderly\
  \ woman, and removed myself from the circle. As I casually strolled towards the\
  \ food carts, a young man of about twenty hurried towards me with a concerned expression.\n\
  \n\u201CAre you alone?\u201D He asked.\n\nI nodded, wary.\n\n\u201CYou shouldn\u2019\
  t be walking alone in the dark; what if the Ta\u2019ay spirits play a prank on you?\u201D\
  \ Then smiling wryly, he added, \u201Cthey especially prey on pretty girls.\u201D\
  \n\nCall me naive, or flattered, but I decided to take up on his offer to join him\
  \ back at his campsite, which to my relief, was a big group comprising of indigenous\
  \ people and local camp goers.\n\nBy then, the group was mostly drunk and toasty\
  \ from the alcohol, and was listening sleepily to the tribe elders regale tales\
  \ by the crackling campfire. A man got so intoxicated he fell asleep under his caravan!\
  \ (\u201CIgnore him, he\u2019s a lightweight,\u201D grumbled his wife). Nudged by\
  \ the young man, I loudly introduced myself \u2014 \u201CI\u2019m a Singaporean\
  \ university student on exchange!\u201D The chattering died down and the group shifted\
  \ their attention towards me.\n\nI felt like an extraterrestrial being amidst eager\
  \ scientists as they probed and bombarded me with all sorts of questions about Singapore\
  \ \u2014 Lee Kuan Yew (a perennial favourite wherever I go), its education system,\
  \ capital punishments, and Singlish, our creolised language that mixes English with\
  \ dialects and different mother tongues.\n\nIt was surreal to be atop the chilly\
  \ mountain, thinking that I was having an \u201Cexotic\u201D adventure far away\
  \ from home, and be transported right back home with these curious strangers who\
  \ knew so much about my country. To be frank, I have never been good at articulating\
  \ my thoughts about Singapore. It rightfully deserves admiration for its successes,\
  \ but I did not want to repeat the state narrative of us transforming from a \u201C\
  fishing village to a first world country\u201D.  Instead, I spoke about the sacrifices\
  \ and forgotten people behind the country\u2019s success. \n\nMaybe it was my candour,\
  \ or the special solidarity strangers feel being in a liminal space, but the mood\
  \ turned confessionary. \n\nThe locals begun sharing with me, and debating amongst\
  \ themselves, issues of Taiwan\u2019s stagnant economy, its struggle for independence,\
  \ lacklustre university education (\u201CTaiwanese educators don\u2019t care if\
  \ the students understand, they just stuff you like ducks for foie gras.\u201D),\
  \ and for the indigenous people, fear that the Saisiyat language might go extinct.\
  \ \n\nWe sighed and commiserated. Ah well, our countries will chug on regardless\
  \ of our concerns. Morning crept up on us, and it was time for papaosa, the sending\
  \ off of spirits ceremony. We parted ways, and I left in awe of this serendipitous\
  \ encounter. The magic of the Ta\u2019ay spirits lives on."
