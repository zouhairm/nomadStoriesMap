Text: "It was rapidly turning into a disaster. My first ever trip to Europe. After\
  \ months of planning & saving. Was swiftly, becoming, one chaotic episode, that\
  \ was going from bad to worse as the day of departure approached. Sitting at Mumbai\
  \ International Airport, waiting for the boarding to begin, I was hoping that a\
  \ miracle could save this trip. It did.\n\nOktoberfest was coming up. That, & the\
  \ fact that one of my closest friends & her husband had moved to Munich, meant it\
  \ was going to be one big party! What started as a conversation, culminated into\
  \ this trip, that I\u2019d imagined I would cherish for a lifetime to come..\n\n\
  But it seemed that destiny had some other intentions entirely. Now mind you, my\
  \ travel history with this particular female, has been disastrously successful (more\
  \ on that later), but disastrous, nevertheless. So this, we had coming. Right when\
  \ I was to travel to Munich, she had to go to UK for an official conference (can't\
  \ say no to the boss, no?) Weren't we in a pickle! My travel tickets were booked,\
  \ my visa had a limited validity, and what was to be a dream was collapsing with\
  \ every word she was uttering. Rescheduling, was not an option. It seemed, that\
  \ this, after all, was going to be a solo trip (semi-solo at best), which for me\
  \ particularly, was daunting. And therefore amid excited faces, at the departure\
  \ section of Mumbai International Airport, mine was the one, fit for a funeral.\n\
  \nBut the minute I landed in Munich (via Muscat, Oman; which has a shocking story\
  \ of a drugged illegal Nepali immigrant, but maybe later?); I knew, that this, would\
  \ be a vacation I would always remember. Anveet, the stranger who was a friend's\
  \ husband at the time, was a darling. He picked me up, suggested places I could\
  \ travel to, helped me with my bookings & told me the way things were done in EU.\
  \ \n\nSo off I went, to Delft, a city in Netherlands, known for its canals & blue\
  \ pottery & technical university. I was dropped off in the city & I went straight\
  \ to the town square in Delft. The weather was acting weird (I was told & can can\
  \ tell you, in Netherlands, that is commonplace). I was drenched & hungry & that's\
  \ when Otelli came to my rescue. It is this charming place in the main square, that\
  \ serves the best cheesecake I've had in my life. It was decadent & had the effect\
  \ that such foods do. I could now head to my abode for the next 2 days, Hostel Delft\
  \ (also, in the main square, they charge ~ 25 Euros per night). The owner was a\
  \ very friendly lady, who showed me to my room (clean place with 2 bunk beds & a\
  \ separate toilet & bath) & marked places I should see on the Delft tourist booklet.\
  \ I was glancing through it, making a broad agenda for the next 2 days, and a list\
  \ of things I wanted to cover, when I realized alone wasn't so bad, after all. Alone,\
  \ in fact was turning out to be rather interesting. And the coming days would be\
  \ a testament to this sentiment.\n\nThe next morning, I was up, before the sun was.\
  \ The early morning shower, though not a welcome one, was refreshing; especially\
  \ because the sun came through. I decided to wait outside Kek's (this eatery in\
  \ the main square had a wide variety in the vegetarian/ vegan/ no meant section).\
  \ I'd even picked out my breakfast - orange juice (which is a must have in Netherlands),\
  \ & avocado on toast. But they did not seem to want to open (it was Monday, they\
  \ were closed). I then headed to another venue on my list, Van Maanen. They had\
  \ a delightful breakfast spread, replete with freshly squeezed orange juice, salad,\
  \ scone, eggs, coffee & cake. Watching life bustle about (on myriad cycles, having\
  \ various functionalities, with kids & baskets & pets), is a moment, in itself,\
  \ that is very plain; but a moment nonetheless, that I will forever remember, for\
  \ it was a prelude, to the surprise that came next..."
