Text: "'Bohemian Rhapsody \u2018 just hit the screens and that\u2019s when we decided\
  \ that why not write down a little about this beautiful town that Freddie Mercury\
  \ grew up in! Yes! He was schooled in India in a beautiful hilly town tucked in\
  \ Maharashtra, Panchgani.\n\nHere are some travel tips if you do plan on visiting\
  \ this beautiful place and paying a tribute to the \u2018Queen\u2019 lead singer\
  \ Freddie Mercury!\n\n\nPanchgani was a British favorite before it became my favorite.\
  \ The perfect blend of hot and cold had British officers running to the hills during\
  \ summers, a lot of them even stayed back and married locals, thus giving this little\
  \ town the little English style cottages and sprawling lawns. Oh! You can spend\
  \ an entire day just walking by these cottages, taking in all that\u2019s left of\
  \ the colonial era! The weather is incredible and it will definitely be \u2018A\
  \ Walk to Remember\u2019.\nA typical breakfast of bun-maska, chai and a double cheese\
  \ omlet at Panchgani\u2019s oldest Parsi caf\xE9 Lucky\u2019s will cost you around\
  \ Rs.100 ($1.42) This little cafe has been here since Mercury's school days and\
  \ still remains a hit among the boys in the boarding!\n\nAnother place the boys\
  \ and Mercury would frequently visit was Akbar Ali, they serve some buttery and\
  \ loaded parathas for Rs.100 ($1.42) a plate! They were super scrumptious and filling.\
  \ Oh! they serve piping hot pav bhaji too!!\n\n\nThis quiet town is tucked in the\
  \ sleepy hills and doesn\u2019t experience a lot of activity, just the hustle, and\
  \ bustle of locals running errands during the day. After 7 pm the town is dim and\
  \ the breeze just sweeps away the chaos. These long walks in the evening had me\
  \ glowing. I suggest you take a romantic walk under the stars too!\n\nAnd maybe\
  \ you'll come across more places that Freddie Mercury had been too!\nI am a huge\
  \ fan of his and this trip somehow got me closer to the life of this late super-star"
