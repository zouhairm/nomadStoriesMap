Text: "Suddenly, I was unemployed and short on cash. I was living in Petr\xF3polis,\
  \ a small city near Rio de Janeiro. I was working at a factory, as a free lancer\
  \ designer, then my boss told me, the company was facing financial problems and\
  \ he would call me back in few months. What was I supposed to do? To look for another\
  \ job? Sure. But I decided to do that in another place. In one of the largest cities\
  \ in the world: S\xE3o Paulo.  The brazilian city that never sleeps. But how could\
  \ I do that without money? The solution was to sell my TV and another gadgets, to\
  \ make a reservation at a hostel and to leave.  That\xB4s what I did. So, I took\
  \ a bus headed to my dream. Five hours later, I was there, in the most crowded city\
  \ of the south hemisphere.  It was such a big risk but I wasn\xB4t afraid. I was\
  \ eager to live there. I was surprised with that new me, because I wasn\xB4t used\
  \ to be a bold person.\n\nI arrived there and took the subway to the hostel. My\
  \ roomates were a guy from Argentina, a  Japanese motorcyclist, who was travelling\
  \ the world and a Brazilian guy. The brazilian one was looking for a job too and\
  \ just like me, he had little money. So we spent some days together, trying to find\
  \ a place to work and a place to live. Because of our financial conditions, we had\
  \ to walk, walk and walk through the city, instead of taking the bus or the subway.\
  \ Our lunch and dinner were only hot dogs. Lucky me, the breakfast was included\
  \ on the hostel rate. The only time I payed for a real lunch at a restaurant, a\
  \ beggar, an old woman, entered the place and asked the owner, something to eat\
  \ and she was expelled by him. But I went to that old lady and invited her to have\
  \ a lunch with me.I wondered how it would be, to have nothing to eat.\n\nPaulista\
  \ Avenue was heaven to me. Monumental, surrounded by modern buildings. I usually\
  \ sat at some bench and kept looking at all that men in suits and I thought: \u201C\
  I belong to this place. I am a business man.\u201D I had a feeling that my place\
  \ on earth was in that concrete jungle and traffic jams. I felt home there. Such\
  \ a big city and at the same time, so friendly.\n\nTen days later and no job, my\
  \ money has gone. So, I had to left my dreams back. \nIt looked like I was a loser\
  \ because i didnt\xB4succeed, but I wasn\xB4t feeling like that. I was feeling as\
  \ a winner.\n\nBack home, time to look for a job. I read on the newspapers about\
  \ a company that was looking for a designer and  I went there for an interview.\
  \ It was a huge factory. They asked me to return the next day for a test. After\
  \ that, I was employed as an assistant designer.\n\nOne year later, I got a promotion.\
  \ As the new department supervisor, I started travelling to S\xE3o Paulo, on business.\
  \ But at that time, travelling by plane, taking cabs, having lunch at restaurants.\
  \ Walking in the same Paulista Avenue, where I used to sit at a bench and wonder\
  \ about my future.\n\nThat\xB4s the magic of the city. It was a ten days experience\
  \ that changed my whole life. Before that jouney, I was always afraid of taking\
  \ chances. After that, I was eager to accept every challenge I faced.\n\nAfter three\
  \ years I left the job and the city. Nowadays I live in Rio de Janeiro. But I usually\
  \ go to S\xE3o Paulo on business and vacation.\n\nS\xE3o Paulo and me, a never-ending\
  \ story."
