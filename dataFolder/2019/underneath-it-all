Text: "A picturesque mountain just a kilometer off, on the horizon darkens on a bright\
  \ summer day. I watch as the rain falls on the hill in the distance. The entie cloud\
  \ romantically sweeps above the gigantic, forested knoll slowly shushing back and\
  \ forth as the trees are lulled by cool winds. \n\nThe heat during the day is impractical\
  \ as the sun can be overwhelming all at once, especially in summer. The hopeful\
  \ traveller can find tranquility in the cool mountains and rainy forests. There\
  \ is much at play here in the rural areas as well as the bustling cities which are\
  \ full of markets and locals.\n\nA fluidity in Spanish linguistics is a neceaaity\
  \ here in the heart of the Central-South Americas. Any traveler will be well off\
  \ to know an interpreter as well. \n\nCommunicating with the locals will give one\
  \ the feel of really being a part of the culture and group travel is often preferable\
  \ as you may be able to start up a street-style futbol match with the local adults\
  \ and children. An interpreter may also be of good helpin finding potential deals\
  \ or events in the place you may be staying.\n\nMany of the areas of Honduras are\
  \ poverse, however, there is a sweet and jovial spirit to the people, culture, and\
  \ rich greenscapes. \n\nThe land is also home many beaches. A few where you can\
  \ even see other countries across the water. One dreams of swimming over and starting\
  \ a new life, perhaps as a trader of precious gems, with only a sun tan and contents\
  \ of the swimsuit you're wearing.\n\nIn any case, the emotional depths of any soul\
  \ can be found in the rain hitting that nearby, sun-soaked, rustling mountain. Perhaps\
  \ you will find a peace for you just off-shore, watching a hollow sunset cast gold\
  \ lining on some distant, foreign land."
