Text: "Varanasi, holiest of cities on the Mother Ganges, city of cows, funeral pyres,\
  \ and reincarnation, is the second stop on a family trip to northern India. As night\
  \ fell, our guide led us to the River Ganges for the evening \u201Carti,\u201D a\
  \ Hindu religious ritual. We walk through ancient streets so narrow that it is necessary\
  \ to travel single file, passing tiny shops filled with tantalizing objects of all\
  \ kinds - bangles, miniature goddess dresses, instruments, sacred pigments. Sometimes\
  \ we meet a cow, and then there is trouble! They are not at all mean, but they are\
  \ big and used to having the run of the road. Dodging their aromatic deposits is\
  \ a challenge, but only a few of us, and I was not among them, sanctify our shoes.\
  \ \n\nThe closer we got to the holy river, the more numerous the small shrines to\
  \ Ganesh (elephant-headed god), Durga, Shiva, and especially, Kali the Destroyer,\
  \ become. \n\nThe path we follow leads to one of the two sites where bodies are\
  \ cremated on funeral pyres. Wood is scarce in India, so it is startling to see\
  \ the huge piles of thick branches silhouetted against the thick, ashy sunset. We\
  \ taste the grit and acrid smoke as we emerge onto a the pyre site where three hundred\
  \ people are cremated every day. Only men are at the pyres.  Women are not allowed.\
  \ We are tolerated, however, as those who seek to learn of death are allowed. There\
  \ is no crying or mourning of any sort. If you die in Varanasi, you are released\
  \ from the cycle of rebirth.\n\nStep after step after step, on stone so old and\
  \ softly rounded by the passing of countless worshippers, we travel down to the\
  \ river and get into a boat as old as the earth itself. Rotting planks with no plastic\
  \ jugs for bailing - a leap of faith!  We row to a place where the evening  arti\
  \ is taking place.\n\nThe arti starts with a call and response between a priest\
  \ and worshippers. Four more priests then appear, and the ceremony gets into high\
  \ gear. With one hand, priests ring large bells to replicate the cosmic sound of\
  \ \u201Com.\u201D  With the other hand they make offerings of the five elements\
  \  - earth, wind, fire, water, and air \u2013 along with rice, honey and camphor,\
  \ using large circular sweeps of their arms. \n\nThe fire offering, or \u201Cagni,\u201D\
  \ lifted in praise to Mother Ganges is the most dramatic. Each priest holds aloft\
  \ large, triangular metal structures on which dozens of little flames glimmer. The\
  \ arc of the flames is mesmerizing. Cobra structures used to offer camphor. similar\
  \ to frankincense, are also fascinating.\n\nAll the while, musicians play a kind\
  \ of den-den drum, and rhythms accelerate and slow depending on the progress of\
  \ the ceremony. Supplicants pull bells suspended overhead on wires 20 feet from\
  \ the ground and 200 feet wide. \n\nThe ceremony closes with another call and response,\
  \ though different from the beginning \u201Cbhujans\u201D (holy songs).  Worshippers\
  \ come down to the river and set afloat a tiny leaf boat with marigold or rose encircled\
  \ flames after making a wish closest to their hearts desire. We set our leaf boat\
  \ out, too, from the boat.  \n\nWe disembark and climb up endless steps, past the\
  \ River Goddess and Boat shrines, then make our way through a lively, and at times\
  \ harrowing bazaar, back to the rickshaws where we ride two to a vehicle. We are\
  \ surrounded by a cacophony of sounds, a rush of bodies and smells (mostly good),\
  \ and a mind-boggling convergence of high speed tuk-tuks, taxis, cars, pedestrians,\
  \ motorcycles, cows, dogs, goats, pigs, and bicycle rickshaws. We bounce back to\
  \ our bus and return, exhausted, over-sensated and exhilarated, wondering how we\
  \ can ever explain the layers upon layers of what we have just experienced. \n\n\
  Dinner is in a daze. We return to our rooms to sleep and prepare for an early morning\
  \ rise\nand another wondrous day in Varanasi. I know, even then, though years and\
  \ distance may separate me, that my heart will always long for this captivating\
  \ city, and that I must, someday return."
