Text: "We all are travellers in this mundane but we forget our true self once we accustomed\
  \  in worldly phenomenon. Naturally,  I had been on that cocoon for three decades\
  \ and trying to live my life without complain until one day, I realised,  I should\
  \ travel. I just married and left Kathmandu after three decades of my life and resided\
  \ at  Biratnagar with my husband and in-laws. My husband was busy and I became restless.\
  \ This was totally different place than I grew up. In my hometown I could see lush\
  \ mountain early in the morning. Weather was perfectly balanced, it would be extremely\
  \ hot nor extremely cold.  But in Biratnagar, everything happened in extreme level.\
  \ Outside, when scorching sun roasted you, makes you sweat like cleaning face from\
  \ water and inside mosquitoes prefer to suck novice blood. Then, one day I decided\
  \ to travel Dharan, one of the cities of Nepal, a bit far from Biratnagar, to spare\
  \ myself from that heat. My husband didn\u2019t agree initially but he agreed at\
  \ last when I defied him to go there alone. \n\n\n\nWe rode Scotty and headed to\
  \ Dharan at dawn. Firstly, we reached latest modernise city Itahari and we crossed\
  \ Dharan in two hours. I felt cool and ease. After an hour, I saw fog, like a white\
  \ cloud moving with us among the trees of the roadside beneath the green mountain.\
  \ That feeling was amazing. I still couldn\u2019t express in words. The fog was\
  \ everywhere, at road, side of the road and above the sky. I should feel cold but\
  \ surprisingly I didn\u2019t, rather I was feeling like in heaven. It was such a\
  \ joy that it is true travel is better than arrival. And I was enjoying every bit\
  \ of it. And our decision to not take bus ride indeed remained good decision. \n\
  \n\n\nWe stopped at Bhedetar, which is 1,420 m high from the sea level. Bhedetar,\
  \ is quite renouned for unpredictable weather,  food and sightseeing. A moment this\
  \ beautiful hill station hides itself in the blanket of thick fog and another moment\
  \ it reveals itself as a crown of the Dharan. We sat one of restaurants of roadside\
  \ at the hill. The restaurant looked average but had in high place, thus, we could\
  \ see lush mountain afar. Tourists like us were busy to take selfie to catch the\
  \ view of mountain along with fog. We ordered  Dharane boar, famous meat among the\
  \ local people with thukpa. My husband drank thungba, a local liquor and we also\
  \ snapped some photos. After that, we rode again almost two kilometres towards west\
  \ and reached the Pathivara temple. It was one among the seven temple of Pathivara,\
  \ a temple of goddess. It\u2019s a belief the goddess can fulfill the wishes of\
  \ pilgrims. \n\nFinally, when we reached Namaste Fall, 8 km away from Bhedetar,\
  \ I couldn\u2019t stop my excitement. I reached up to the fall. It was 80 meters\
  \ high. When I entered the centre of the fall alone, I could swapped away by the\
  \ amount of water force. But still I took risk. Many domestic tourists were taking\
  \ photos with their friends and relatives. My husband didn\u2019t go under water\
  \ fall to protect camera, but that didn\u2019t stop me to venture my adventure.\
  \ It was such a liberal feeling I still can not express in words. Water was cold\
  \ but I didn\u2019t feel it. It was my me time with water. Nature is such a bless\
  \ and I was lucky enough to get that. I spent more than hours in water. Then, we\
  \ headed to search hotel to stay at night. We booked a room at lodge of Bhedetar\
  \ and dined local hen and rice. After three months, I was putting on blankets at\
  \ night and slept sound sleep."
