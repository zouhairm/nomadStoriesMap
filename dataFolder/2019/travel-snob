Text: "Traveling is like having an intense crush on someone.  You jump in with fear\
  \ and trepidation hoping to have something beautiful and accessible to everyone\
  \ choose you exclusively. You lust after it in hopes it makes you a better more\
  \ interesting and loveable person. Sometimes you actually fall in love with a place\
  \ and it fills you up in a way that is reserved only for family or long time lovers.\
  \ I expected all of these things when I started to hike and travel. I thought about\
  \ my traumas, I thought about my enlightenment, I thought about love, and I thought\
  \ about my fears a lot. What I didn\u2019t expect to find on the Inca Trail, in\
  \ the heart of the Teton National Forest, and in Zion National Park is I may be\
  \ a travel snob. I didn\u2019t expect to feel unwelcoming and ugly about my fellow\
  \ adventurers. I find myself wondering how to share and talk about my experiences\
  \ without hating people for not \u201Cgetting it\u201D the same way I do or hating\
  \ myself for feeling that way. A perception exists that travel is for people with\
  \ money or trendy emotional upheavals that are so monumental that the only way to\
  \ heal or become enlightened is to travel to exotic places and cure themselves with\
  \ filtered Instagram pictures of epic views. Is that true? Is that true of me? Have\
  \ my adventures made me a snob?\n\nAfter four days on the Inca Trail, hiking and\
  \ camping in the Andes Mountains my group came through the Sun Gate and into Machu\
  \ Picchu. This was a life long dream since I was in the sixth grade. It was my screensaver\
  \ and password on my computer for years. I collected books and stories about the\
  \ lost city in the clouds. It was a magical place with the souls of a lost culture\
  \ embedded in every step I climbed. On the top of Dead Woman\u2019s Pass I thought\
  \ about my weaknesses that are too many to count and I felt every slave and every\
  \ Inca Princess who walked that trail before me. But when I entered Machu Picchu,\
  \ I felt immediately annoyed. I was tired but full of wanderlust until a lady in\
  \ high heels swinging a Prada bag blew by the sacred stones like she was walking\
  \ through a Neiman Marcus. \n\nMy friends and I hiked thirteen miles through the\
  \ Orderville Canyon ending in the Narrows in Zion National Park. I swear I met that\
  \ same lady with the Prada purse sloshing around the Narrows with a million other\
  \ people posing and preening for the perfect postcard picture to post on their social\
  \ media sites. \n\nI happen to be lucky enough to know people who are privy to trails\
  \ in and around the Grand Teton and West Yellowstone Parks that are not marked or\
  \ known to many tourists. Last summer we ventured off the touristy trails for one\
  \ of these local favorite spots just in front of a group of young girls from Germany.\
  \ It was fun sharing the directions to the hidden turquoise lake with them. I wanted\
  \ them to feel the way I did about not knowing exactly if I was on the right path.\
  \ A group of men coming out of the trees heard us sharing the directions and one\
  \ of them looked at us and said, \u201CDon\u2019t tell them, it ruins everything.\u201D\
  \ I thought I didn\u2019t share their sentiments, but part of me wanted to tell\
  \ those girls how to feel about the grandeur and beauty before them. Part of me\
  \ wanted to tell them to put away their phones for a few minutes and contemplate\
  \ their mortality in the lake like a Sylvia Plath poem \u201Csearching the reaches\
  \ for what they really are.\u201D\n\nI didn\u2019t expect to find this hidden travel\
  \ snob inside me, but I have come to the conclusion that I need to keep a part of\
  \ it to preserve the essence of my experiences. I also need to allow for other people\
  \ to be where they are in the world and hope that a part of them falls in love with\
  \ these places enough to fill their soul and advocate for their preservation."
