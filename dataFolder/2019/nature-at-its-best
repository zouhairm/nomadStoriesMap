Text: "It all started with my trip to Island Palma in Spain one of the most scenic\
  \ and beautiful. What made me travel that place was the inventory model that I use\
  \ to optimize my tourist cost and a peaceful landscape city but I didn't know something\
  \ else was expecting me there. A really damn utter silence, a fearful one.\n   \
  \  I landed around 2:30 pm at Palma airport and I planned to leave by 4 pm to reach\
  \ Alucidia one of the most scenic beaches in that island as I am a photographer\
  \ I travel to less explored places. English language is not very common in this\
  \ small cities and this led me to a new unexplored place. The Bus dropped me to\
  \ a point some 5km before the main city which I thought was Alucidia as the buses\
  \ were not allowed to enter those areas but to my surprise it was not Alucidia something\
  \ really unknown. It was 6:30 in evening and I cannot find anyone just barren fields.\
  \ The worst which can happen to anyone is when you are without your network. It\
  \ was getting darker and darker, no vehicles no street lights.  \n    I totally\
  \ gave up on that day because I was thirsty, hungry but still I wanted to explore\
  \ and then I heard a waterfall at some distance. It is the nature which helped me\
  \ and I understand one must know basic tactics to survive any area. Shhhhh I heard\
  \ a waterfall, the very first thing I understood if there is water there is life\
  \ and since the water was flowing down so I make my way in the direction of water.\
  \ I waited near the water side for 2 hours took some of the best photos without\
  \ street lights and it was mesmerizing. I continued my journey more down and at\
  \ 3 am at night I found a beautiful city sleeping  and welcoming me. \n    What\
  \ a relief a big one Hah.... Just wanted to talk with many but 3 am no one somehow\
  \ I rented a hotel slept and it was still a dream to me that I survived that path\
  \ without my mobile in night at a really unknown place for 7 hours at night. I never\
  \ felt confident like this ever before. Wanted to know what was this place, it was\
  \ Porto Cristo. A beautiful city, on that day I traveled to yet another place Drach\
  \ caves, I was expecting no one but there were a lot of tourist, but what was more\
  \ beautiful to me was the back side of Drach caves where no one visits. It is a\
  \ narrow valley going down from Drach caves where one is allowed to go but with\
  \ own risks. Step by step I went down and people saw me from above. When I reached\
  \ down I was paralyzed with the beauty, from the small caves I entered a mighty\
  \ ocean, waves and the dark rich blue water, with an infinity display no end. No\
  \ one expect the sound of water. Wait I didn't expect anyone but the people who\
  \ saw me going down also came and looks as if I got a company. Then what I cancelled\
  \ my hotel reservation because the family had camps and they cannot find a better\
  \ place than this in the mouth of ocean. The whole night we enjoyed drinks, dance,\
  \ seafood and the best photography I could ever do in my life. Sometimes I feel\
  \ nature is the best medicine, it is your parent. The nature is always helping us\
  \ no matter in what situation we are."
