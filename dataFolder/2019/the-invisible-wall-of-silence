Text: "\u201CWHO ARE YOU?\u201D\n\nThe question, written in bold red letters, takes\
  \ up most part of the wooden wall inside of the shack. Underneath it, white papers\
  \ displayed right next to each other hold the answers to this not-so-simple query:\n\
  \n\u201CMY NAME IS KAMIRA KUIKURO.\nI HAVE SEVEN CHILDREN.\u201D\n\n\u201CMY NAME\
  \ IS KUSAKI KUIKURO.\nI HAVE FOUR CHILDREN.\u201D \n\nThe names are different, but\
  \ the sense of identity and belonging among women here doesn\u2019t seem to change\
  \ much across all ten papers that are hanging on the wall: \u201C I am a mother.\u201D\
  \n\nIt\u2019s been two days since I\u2019ve arrived in the Afukuri tribe which is\
  \ located inside the Indigenous Territory of Xingu, the first region to be homologated\
  \ in Brazil, in 1961. Even though we live in the same country, it feels like we\
  \ are several years apart. The closest city is located five hours from here making\
  \ access to food, proper sewage and hygiene very limited. \n\nEven with all the\
  \ difficulties that exist here, what strikes me the most is the uncomfortable and\
  \ almost palpable silence that hovers among women. Are the voices that want to shout\
  \ out their opinions but are blocked by a stronger cultural force. \n\n\u201CGood\
  \ morning, Sahit\xED,\" I say to the Cacique\u2019s wife as  I get up at 5:30 a.m.\
  \ \n\nHead down, she just nods back at me with a timid smile while spreading the\
  \ cassava flour on an iron skillet pan. \n\n\u201CCan I help you with anything?\u201D\
  \ I ask as I'm standing next to her.\n\nWith the corner of her eyes, she looks up\
  \ and waves at me as a sign of \u201CNo, it\u2019s okay.\u201D She's preparing beiju,\
  \ a typical indigenous food that resembles a tapioca crepe. \n\nAs the sun begins\
  \ to rise, her husband walks slowly to join us. \n\n\"Good morning,\" he says in\
  \ a sleepy voice. \n\nAs we are all sitting on a tree trunk, Sahit\xED keeps on\
  \ preparing our breakfast. The morning dew feels nice on my skin and a sense of\
  \ peacefulness fills the air. \n\n\"How do you make it?\" I ask her curiously.\n\
  \nThe question seems to come as train on a track. The words are almost coming out\
  \ of her mouth but, confused, she starts speaking carib with her husband who explains\
  \ the process to us in portuguese.\n\nOver the course of these days, that scene\
  \ happened several times. At breakfast, at parties. At first I thought: \u201CIt\
  \ must be the language barrier,\"' but after a while it started bugging me. In an\
  \ attempt to connect with them, I decided to change my strategy.  \n\nPointing my\
  \ finger at the iron skillet, I asked: \u201CCan you show it to me?\u201D\n\nShe\
  \ gently grabs my hands and starts guiding me. They are rough, and I can feel the\
  \ arduous weight that she carries from having to harvest and cook the food, build\
  \ houses, and to take care of her family. We spread the flour over the pan and wait\
  \ for about a minute. With an ear spatula made out of wood, we press down the beiju\
  \ so it sticks together. Now, she releases my hands and does a sing for me to flip\
  \ it to the other side. I look at her, she gives me a warm and confident look as\
  \ to say: \u201CYou\u2019ve got this.\u201D I clumsy flip over the tapioca. She\
  \ laughs. We both laugh. We look at each other and Sahit\xED smiles at me with approval.\
  \ \n\nWe eat the beiju and drink our coffees, just enjoying the blissful moment\
  \ we had. Right then, I felt I was finally able to bond, to connect. It might seem\
  \ ordinary to some, but to me, it was as if an invisible wall of silence was removed\
  \ between us.\n\nAs a person who lives in a culture where women have already conquered\
  \ so many rights despite all injustices that still dwell, it\u2019s hard to keep\
  \ in mind that every society has its particularities and believes.\n\nIt's clear\
  \ to me that behind the dark eyes, timid smile and silence of the Afukuri women,\
  \ lay strong and decisive persons full of dreams and opinions. Women who are not\
  \ only mothers, but who are the true responsibles for holding and preserving the\
  \ indigenous culture."
