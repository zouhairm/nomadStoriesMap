Text: "We\u2019d spoken of packing our belongings and leaving it all behind, but who\
  \ hasn\u2019t? It\u2019s a fantasy shared, perhaps, by every red-blooded human-being\
  \ roaming the earth and for good reason; there\u2019s a fundamental fascination\
  \ with the unknown. \n Tim- my large, red-headed brother from another mother- and\
  \ I had spent many days during the dawn of summer 2012 going on at length about\
  \ where we\u2019d go and what we\u2019d do should the moment to flee our hometown\
  \ ever come to fruition. \n We\u2019d buy a case of beer or a bottle of whiskey\
  \ and allow our childlike wonder full access to the possibilities. It was just how\
  \ I\u2019d plot my \u201Cfuture house\u201D when I was 10; hidden passways; a fireman\u2019\
  s pole from the second to first story; a slide out the front door.\n As rare as\
  \ these sorts of aspirations are in becoming a reality, I received a phone call\
  \ at dawn just after a night of celebrating Cinco De Mayo with a group of friends\
  \ over a beer-pong table. \n Tim- whom we\u2019d dubbed \u201CThe Ginge\u201D on\
  \ account of his head full of red hair- had been my partner at beer pong, and the\
  \ topic of abandoning our lives as we knew it had taken on a new fervor as the alcohol\
  \ we were consuming fueled the wild, endless possibilities jumping ship might enact.\
  \ \n \u201CWe could just drive and stop at every spot worth a damn from Ohio to\
  \ California, dip south down the coast, and make our way back east,\u201D he fantasized.\
  \ \n I met his ambition and fired back, \u201CThat would be amazing! Imagine the\
  \ stories we\u2019d be able to tell! I\u2019d have journals scribbled out from end\
  \ to end!\u201D\n \u201CWe could skydive in New York to put a fat period on the\
  \ whole trip!\u201D\n \u201COver Niagra Falls, no less!\u201D\n Our friends, more\
  \ often than not, would roll their eyes and nod being familiar with our rants, but\
  \ this seemed to only incite the Ginge to become more passionate on the idea. \n\
  \ It was likely the lack of shared optimism from our peers that had my phone ringing\
  \ at 7 AM the following morning, and despite the hangover that\u2019d only just\
  \ begun to dig its claws into my neck, I rolled over and answered it.\n \u201CGinge...\
  \ what\u2019s going on?\u201D I grumbled.\n He sounded as though the copious amounts\
  \ of consumption from the previous night hadn\u2019t phased him in the slightest.\
  \ \u201CPack your bags, brother. We\u2019re going west, and I ain\u2019t taking\
  \ \u2018no\u2019 as an answer!\u201D \n I sat up and tried to clear my head uncertain\
  \ I\u2019d heard him correctly. \u201CTim... Ginge... buddy... what are you talking\
  \ about?\u201D\n \u201CYou have money saved up from the Navy, right?\u201D\n I said,\
  \ \u201CNot a whole helluva lot, but a fair amount.\u201D\n He pressed on, \u201C\
  I get my monthly check for retirement from the Army. Between the both of us, we\
  \ should have enough to fund our adventure!\u201D\n \u201CTim,\u201D I said, pinching\
  \ my eyes, \u201CI\u2019ve gotta work today. I\u2019ve gotta work tomorrow, too,\
  \ for that matter. How do you suggest I explain to them I won\u2019t...\u201D\n\
  \ \u201CPaul,\u201D he interrupted, \u201Cit won\u2019t matter when we\u2019re lying\
  \ on Redondo Beach sipping Bloody Mary\u2019s and swimming in the ocean. I already\
  \ told you; I\u2019m not taking \u2018no\u2019 as an answer. I\u2019m on my way.\u201D\
  \n With that, he hung up, and I stood to my feet to make coffee. I\u2019d have to\
  \ be on my oral game if I were to talk him down from this madness. \n He arrived\
  \ within twenty minutes, and before he was even through the front door, I knew there\u2019\
  d be no talking him down. His Jeep was filled with luggage and his dog- Rex- was\
  \ anxiously waiting for his best friend to rejoin him in the front seat.\n I managed\
  \ two bags after a brief debate, and we were actually doing it... we were tearing\
  \ down the highway without a map but only following the signs that told us \u201C\
  west.\u201D \n We were probably on the road for forty-five minutes before what we\
  \ were accomplishing truly set in. \n \u201CLet\u2019s stop and get some beer for\
  \ the night.\u201D\n I stuck my head out the window and howled with excitement toward\
  \ the unfamiliar horizone before us."
