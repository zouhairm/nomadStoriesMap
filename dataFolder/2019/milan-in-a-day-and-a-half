Text: "Up until I was 20 point the only times I had delved into the world of solo\
  \ travel was going home from uni during the holidays. While this probably did not\
  \ actually count, as someone who had lived an extraordinarily sheltered (boring)\
  \ life, being able to travel on the train from Reading to Crewkerne by myself was\
  \ a bit too exciting.  \nFast forward to a few days ago, and I am living in Florence,\
  \ Italy, am over half way through my Erasmus year, and am going to a concert in\
  \ Milan by myself. I had never been to Milan before or had gone to a concert by\
  \ myself before, or literally any concert since the age when I was very in to the\
  \ Tweenies. \n\nI had my little overnight bag, had booked a hotel room right next\
  \ to the venue (the whole thing was theoretically a birthday present to myself as\
  \ my very low expectations for my 21st had not been met). I got the train to Milano\
  \ Centrale, tickets for which I really should have bought significantly more in\
  \ advance. I got the train from Milano Centrale to Milano Rogoredo, even though\
  \ a direct train to Milano Rogoredo would have made a lot more sense. I had googled\
  \ the bus route from the station to the hotel multiple times in the days before\
  \ but after half an hour or so wandering around aimlessly outside the station in\
  \ the 22 degree Milan heat and not discovering anything resembling the correct bus\
  \ stop, I gave up an got an overpriced taxi instead.\nThe hotel was lovely. The\
  \ room was on the 4th floor and was huge and clean and that night I don't think\
  \ I had ever before slept in such a comfy bed. \nWhen I got to the concert venue,\
  \ with around an hour to go before doors opened, the line for the entrance was already\
  \ huge. \n\nThe concert itself was amazing, I had never felt an atmosphere quite\
  \ like it ever. Everyone was enjoying themselves.\n\nThe next morning I learnt that\
  \ you definitely get what you pay for with hotels in Italy. The one star hotel in\
  \ the centre of Florence that I stayed in on my first night of my Erasmus year was\
  \ actually awful. This 4 star hotel was the opposite. After my 3 course gluten free\
  \ feast of a breakfast, I went back to my room, packed up my stuff, and checked\
  \ out. Afterwards I managed to successfully find the bus stop for Rogoredo, I felt\
  \ annoyed with myself yet also smug at the 12 euros I had saved myself. In order\
  \ to get to Milano centrale I even got to experience the joy that is the Milan metro\
  \ system (and I mean that, it was a lot less stressful than travelling on the London\
  \ Underground). \n\nIf I had to draw any conclusions from my overnight trip it would\
  \ be that I really need to go more places by myself. If I always had to wait for\
  \ someone else to want to go with me, I would hardly do anything. My other conclusion\
  \ would be that I am obviously even quieter than I previously thought I was, as\
  \ neither of my flatmates realised I had gone anywhere."
