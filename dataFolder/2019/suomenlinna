Text: "A trip to the very beautiful, Suomenlinna Island sea fortress was scheduled\
  \ for the last week in Finland. \n On the way, near the Helsinki harbour place,\
  \ I found a Denmark coin that I chose to keep as a souvenir. The journey to Suomenlinna\
  \ was beautiful; the sunny weather and the chill breeze with the seagulls partaking\
  \ in this safari and flying just some inches above our heads. We reached within\
  \ some minutes and on arrival were given a brochure that contained the map and other\
  \ details about Suomenlinna. We were asked to go in our college groups and first\
  \ make a brief video of around 4-5 minutes on our experience of the Finnish culture,\
  \ the practices that we would like to take back and the overall feel. We then passed\
  \ by the Island\u2019s Church and other old forts and saw submarines and other ships\
  \ that were probably not in use, by the harbour. My friend, Precilla and myself,\
  \ decided to choreograph steps and make some dance videos but another friend called\
  \ Nivedha got very jealous, I guess, probably because she couldn\u2019t dance, tired\
  \ and fed up and refused to make take the video. Seeing the blunt reaction that\
  \ she gave, Precilla and myself decided to smartly use our Professor\u2019s I Phone\
  \ and ask our dear friend, Shubham to make some cool videos for us, post lunch.\
  \ Then, we were scheduled to meet by mid day for lunch at the Restaurant Cafe Chapman\
  \ whereby I had Tuna fish for the very first time in my life and yeah, it was quite\
  \ good. Also, I had lentil soup which was really tasty and could also be used as\
  \ 'dal' for my rice, some veggies and some salad with some drinks.\nAfter lunch,\
  \ the entire team met to have a group photo but Precilla and I were still by the\
  \ forts dancing to \u2018balam pichkaari\u2019, with Shubham, very sincerely taking\
  \ the video for us. After all this, we were gifted Fazer chocolates as gifts by\
  \ our Finnish research partners, Amanda, Susanna and Pinja. We hugged them and bid\
  \ them adieu and I silently hoped so bad to meet them again in future. I shall cherish\
  \ that last moment with them. The next big surprise for us, Loyola students, came\
  \ from the Finnish Professor Sarii. She took us around the coasts of Suomenlinna\
  \ and then Helsinki with her husband, who instructed us in detail about the coastal\
  \ region, where we would be travelling and how we should behave like, in the waters.\
  \ \nThe boat they owned was quite fancy and owning one of them is an expensive deal\
  \ too, I heard. The boat had like three rooms and a small kitchen space and also\
  \ a toilet. \nWe wore really huge jackets to keep ourselves warm, the safety harness\
  \ belt, gloves, monkey cap and some woollen cloth to protect the ears. We got the\
  \ chance to even ride the boat and sit at the vanguard and enjoy the boat movements.\
  \ That was one of the most beautiful experiences that I would always cherish; sleeping\
  \ by the vanguard and gazing up at the sky and the beautiful borders of this amazing\
  \ country, and also waving off at random ship captains and people that passed by,\
  \ in the waters. Finally, by evening, we came by the Helsinki coast and had tea\
  \ with everyone, in the boat itself. What I realised that day was boats and ships\
  \ aren\u2019t as easy to handle as it looks like; tieing the ropes and parking it\
  \ by the harbour or even jumping on or off the boat carefully, needs attention."
