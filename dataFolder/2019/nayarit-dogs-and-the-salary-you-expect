Text: "At the end of the highway 200 of our country, there\xB4s a town where each\
  \ dog in the street has an owner, everybody feeds them and everybody know their\
  \ names; a small town where every person in the world finds the passion of living\
  \ a kind of \u201Cparadise\u201D with the essential of life. And, there I was, trying\
  \ to start a new conversation beside a taco fish food truck at 9 pm. Locals are\
  \ few in this side of the bay but, all of them have a strange and a beautiful story\
  \ that take them or their family to that place. As soon as I started to dinner,\
  \ one guy and his wife started to chat with me about the few pieces of tortilla\
  \ and how much dogs appreciate any food given by the humans.\nWe were chatting about\
  \ their kids and the small surf school beside the sea they have at Punta Mita and\
  \ the kind of tranquil life they have day by day. As soon, I realized I was not\
  \ paying attention at all, I was figuring out the huge debts I had to pay to the\
  \ hospital, to my mom and the big plans for studying a master then, a small light\
  \ of wisdom got through my mind\u2026 passed my thoughts and I realized that my\
  \ life was that: waiting and counting the days till the new payment arrives to my\
  \ job\xB4s card. \nHow fun and interesting was life with less winning the most with\
  \ some small talks not only with humans, also with pets."
