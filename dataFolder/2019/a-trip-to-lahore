Text: "I was sitting, it was 10 o clock at night. Just one hour left until it was\
  \ 11. My bags were packed. I was watching the clock.\nTick tock tick tock. \nMy\
  \ father called me. He told me the routes i need yo follow in Lahore. I sat beside\
  \ him and listened carefully what he told me. \nAt 11 o clock, I called an uber\
  \ and went to the railway station. The train was standing on the platform. I went\
  \ into the train, went straight up on my bearth and slept. I woke when me and my\
  \ sister reached Lahore. It was foggy there. We went to a friend's home where we\
  \ changed and ate breakfast. After that we went to the Dehli gate. There were so\
  \ many people waiting for photowalk.\nI took out my camera and started taking pictures.\
  \ This day was a very adventurous day. I went to the Heera Mandi (red light area\
  \ in Lahore). I wanted to see that area for so long, finally my wish got accepted.\
  \ I was feeling good.\nAfter this, we went to the market where I saw shops of khussa,\
  \ drums, and other musical instruments.\nWe went a bit further and there it was\
  \ the end of the photowalk. This day is a very memorable day of my life. Lahore\
  \ is a city full of culture and heritage and photographers like me who likes colorful\
  \ culture are always attracted to these cities. Like Lahore, I want to travel to\
  \ other parts of the world as well where there is culture, beauty and memories."
