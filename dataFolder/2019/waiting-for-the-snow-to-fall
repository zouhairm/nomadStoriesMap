Text: "A short young man wearing a black slick suit and with dandruff in his raven-black\
  \ hair was sitting next to me. Holding chicken feet with disposable gloves he was\
  \ eating them, lipsmacking. I had ten hours in the air ahead of me en route from\
  \ Wuhan to Moscow.\n. . . \n\nIn Guangzhou we checked into a small hotel in one\
  \ of the neighbourhoods, only 5 mins on foot from the zoo. The hall was always occupied\
  \ by stodgy men that talked loudly and ate peanuts, leaving the shells right there,\
  \ on the table. The neighbouring houses\u2019 occupants dried their laundry right\
  \ out on the street - they hung children\u2019s crawlers, panties, pants right on\
  \ the ropes in front of the windows. Old men sat on small plastic chairs in front\
  \ of the benches, smoked, played go, drank tea.\n\n\nThe subway was loud, stuffy,\
  \ full of people. People would look into you, through you; step on your feet and\
  \ painfully push with shoulders. The main business street of Guangzhou was packed\
  \ - a chaotic stream of people swapped you up and carried directly into the walls,\
  \ houses, signs, crashed into doors and hollered in an unknown bird language. It\
  \ was quiet only in midnight supermarkets - a girl with slick pulled back hair was\
  \ eating ramen right there in the shop, her head resting against her fisted hand.\n\
  \nYou open the hotel\u2019s window and your eyes get in a house; grey boxes spread\
  \ across many kilometres and disappear into the horizon, a soft lilac smog hangs\
  \ over the city; you close your eyes and see the emerald jungle. \n\n\u2026 sweet\
  \ water from a just cracked coconut, violet and gold sky of Tanah Lot, dragons frozen\
  \ in cinders, hungrily sucking on the slate monkeys, salt water streaming from nose,\
  \ ears, throat. A biker in a Harley Davidson helmet with a nut coloured skin cuts\
  \ in front of you - you own bike dies right in the middle of the street that immediately\
  \ overflows with honking, shouting and ringing. You drag your bike to the curb and\
  \ spend a good half hour looking for gas, a canister with the magical light-blue\
  \ liquid. The wind tears through the hair, you speed on the oncoming lane - \u201C\
  It\u2019s left-hand traffic here, are you mad?\u201D - sweating and groaning, you\
  \ turn left. In the evenings in the temple singing and gong are heard, under your\
  \ feet - flowers and biscuits, - all for the carnivore Gods. A hurtful bang on the\
  \ head - the rubber board, the sky is closing up with a blue veil, the sun, a sticky\
  \ pancake, sinks in the ocean; try to swim out but the cunning blue turns you upside\
  \ down every time, \u201Cit hurts, hurts, please stop\u201D - you almost cry when\
  \ whispering this, not realizing that you\u2019re talking to someone who doesn\u2019\
  t exist. Walking up the endless steps, sand in the eyes, hair tangled, the noon\
  \ sun ferocious; hands are scratching the tree; down there, a couple of hundred\
  \ metres below, there\u2019s a strip of snow-white sand, overhanging cliffs and\
  \ poisonous flora. The water crashes onto the shore, foam rises up to the knee or\
  \ even higher, a frame falls - \u201CThere was an earthquake yesterday, haven\u2019\
  t you heard?\u201D - man/white monkey, tied with ropes, is thrashing in the fire,\
  \ you slide your hands against the monkey sculpture bundled in a shirt, moss is\
  \ lightly pricking the finger pads...\n\n. . . \n\u201CYou funny girl, why are you\
  \ closing your eyes, do you think that the ocean will forgive and not notice?\u201D\
  \ - silver and ice eyes are laughing. I think I\u2019m starting to understand why\
  \ you like this huge heavy blue, that\u2019s ready to sweep everyone - you, me,\
  \ your bike, this whole world - away from this shore, so much.\n \n. . . \n \nI\u2019\
  m in worn flip-flops from the local supermarket, torn short and with sun bleached\
  \ hair, sitting right on the steps in front of the supermarket; I\u2019m chewing\
  \ on something and it\u2019s as if I\u2019m bored and I\u2019m waiting for someone;\
  \ bikes whizz by - loaded with Indonesians, their earthly possessions, dried crabs\
  \ and surfs; the sky is blazing with stars, the ocean insistently rustles. \n. .\
  \ . \nI raise my head to this sky and wait for the snow to fall."
