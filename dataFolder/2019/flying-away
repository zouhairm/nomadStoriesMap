Text: "When I was a little girl, I used to draw butterflies. Starting from the slim\
  \ body, then going on to the wings, with four little circles on their ends. My greatest\
  \ dream at that time was to fly. I was envious of insects and birds because of that.\
  \ Freedom, my unchanging desire. Today, the day before my thirtieth birthday, I\
  \ have decided to take the plane and fly for the first time. Destination? Unknown.\
  \ I will decide at the airport.\nI have prepared all I need: sweaters, trousers,\
  \ sneakers, my toothbrush of course.\nI go to the airport and start reading the\
  \ destinations: Milan, Rome, Madrid, Paris... Paris? Never been there... I decide\
  \ to take a ticket for the French capital. Two hours to take-off.\nI reach the waiting\
  \ room and sit down. My feet are tingling, while I see the planes flying away at\
  \ my side, over the glass wall. There is a young couple in front of me. They seem\
  \ happy, kissing each other, he has a tattoo on his hand. Alone, but I am going\
  \ to Paris. I will visit the Eiffel Tower, the high fashion streets, I will eat\
  \ croissants and wander along the Seine bank. But I also want to see what is unknown,\
  \ maybe the window of a decaying shop, a sunset on a poor house, a children running\
  \ after a pigeon.\nI put my scarf on my shoulders, a shiver passes through me.\n\
  Boarding time arrives: I walk with the young couple and a few other people along\
  \ a white corridor, carrying my little suitcase. Step by step, I enjoy my freedom,\
  \ while my fear of the unknown is slowly turning into excitement. \nIn my seat on\
  \ the plane, I am watching my town becoming smaller and smaller, darker and darker,\
  \ while the sun sets at my side and my feet rise from the ground.\nI am hanging\
  \ in space."
