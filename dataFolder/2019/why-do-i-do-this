Text: "It was summer. I had worked all year long to save money for the vacations and\
  \ there a was, at the base of the Sierra Maestra Mountain, about to fulfill my dreams\
  \ of mountaineering. I had one goal: to get to the highest point. It was still early\
  \ morning, I could feel the moisture sticking on my skin and the cold onslaughts\
  \ of the wind pushing my body back.  \nEverything was dark, I could only see a wide\
  \ path of stones in front of me. I confess that I was intimidated. It took me about\
  \ fifteen minutes to take the first step. I had decided to wear uncomfortable, but\
  \ pretty shoes, and all I can remember about the first kilometers is the contact\
  \ of my feet and the little pointy rocks on the road. When I recall those moments,\
  \ they come along with the pain caused by the stones and the sensation of a dense\
  \ air that stuck in my throat and did not allow me to breathe. I thought about stopping,\
  \ more times than I can count, I thought I could save some more money and return\
  \ the next year, but for some reason, I just kept walking. \nThe green did not take\
  \ long to appear. I made a pause, I needed to catch my breath. I noticed a sort\
  \ of natural stairways that rose up in the landscape. From that point ahead I was\
  \ able to admire countless paths drawn in the mud; a large number of leaves that\
  \ were dressed in peculiar shapes; and hidden close to the earth, some of the sweetest\
  \ berries I've ever tasted. It was comforting to walk to the rhythm of the trill\
  \ of endemic birds, watching the passages covered by beautiful vines and drink the\
  \ fresh water from the springs. The sun was up in the sky, the journey was ending,\
  \ but despite the natural beauties, fatigue overwhelmed me and it made me consider\
  \ the idea of \u200B\u200Bgiving up. \"Why do I do this?\" -I kept thinking and\
  \ also kept walking. I honestly believed  that when I reached the highest point\
  \ I would have the answer to that question.\nBut, for my surprise, I did not have\
  \ to go that far. A few kilometers before reaching the top, I stumbled on a road\
  \ from which you could see the division of the provinces of Santiago de Cuba and\
  \ Granma. From that narrow passage, I could observe the coasts of Santiago. The\
  \ sun bathed the sea, and in the distance, the waves became one with the clouds.\
  \ The wind blew, with the strength of the warriors who protected themselves in the\
  \ Sierra during our independence fights. The clouds were propelled towards the mountain,\
  \ I could see them approaching, then they disappeared and the particles of dust\
  \ and water droplets collided with my face. That was the moment where I figured\
  \ it out, I understood why I had continued the climb. \nI reached the top of the\
  \ Turquino , the highest point of the Sierra Maestra. It was pretty, but it was\
  \ not a big deal. I had already understood that a big deal was to have spent all\
  \ those kilometers of hard fight against the stones and the fatigue, to have been\
  \ able to enjoy every little moment and finally, to have reached the top."
