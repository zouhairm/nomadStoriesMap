  . I didn\u2019t expect to find what I am in a trip. But I did.\n\nIn 2010 I was\
  \ twenty six and I had all my work done. I had studied my degree in Economics and\
  \ my Master\u2019s degree in Advertising. I had certified my knowledge in two foreign\
  \ languages and I had my first real job. I had done everything I was expected to\
  \ do. My friends were starting their new lives by themselves or with their somebodies.\
  \ They were changing. Life was changing. And I wanted that everything stayed the\
  \ same. I had been preparing for that moment so hard that I didn\u2019t stop to\
  \ realize that kind of life just wasn\u2019t for me.\n\nMy somebody left me. My\
  \ friends and family didn\u2019t understand me. I quit my job and wrote a list of\
  \ all the places of the world that I wanted to visit. Most of them were in Italy,\
  \ so I bought an Interrail ticket and left my fears behind. Or so I thought. I am\
  \ aware that is not impressive, not even unsual. But I had never travelled abroad.\
  \ I had never travelled alone. I had felt the need, but I was too dependent from\
  \ everyone. Until then.\n\nI travelled by train from my hometown in Spain to Venice\
  \ for one day and two nights. When I arrived, the fog shrouded the Canal Grande\
  \ like if I were at the top of a mountain. I was so tired that I run into my hotel\
  \ and slept until the next day. I was scared of strangers. Of the night. I think\
  \ I barely spoke to anyone apart from the hotel staff and the restaurants waiters.\n\
  \nI cried in the bridges, throughout the \"sestieri\", in the whole lagoon. I cried\
  \ for the girl I had been ignoring for too many years. For the ordinary life I was\
  \ turning my back to. And I cried because I didn\u2019t have a hint of where I was\
  \ heading to. I guess I was just growing up.\n\nI arrived to the Tuscan town of\
  \ Cortona one sunny morning. The hotel manager was supposed to send someone to pick\
  \ me up, but she forgot. The station lays at the foot of a mountain, and it was\
  \ empty. So was the street. I finally found someone to get me a cab and went to\
  \ the hotel to left my luggage. I walked though the village, I ate a cherry and\
  \ lemon ice cream that still appears in my dreams and then I stepped into a church.\
  \ I stayed close to the door because it was full of well dressed people. I was surprised\
  \ by the neatness of the Italians to go to a mass. Eventually I realized I was not\
  \ attending to a simple mass, but to a funeral. When the night came, I dressed up\
  \ with fancier clothes, did my make up and went to a restaurant. I discovered the\
  \ \"zuppa ribollita\", I ate \"rag\xF9\" and drank red wine, even if I do not like\
  \ it. Then I went to watch an Italian movie to the local cinema and found out that\
  \ Italian has a lot in common with Spanish and especially with Galician, my second\
  \ mother tongue.\n\nNext day I had problems with my credit cards, but I handled\
  \ thanks to the kindest cab driver of Cortona, who took me to the station in exchange\
  \ for a promise that I would send him the money when I came back home. Then I travelled\
  \ to Florence.\n\nI didn\u2019t notice it at that time, but when I arrived something\
  \ had already changed. I went to have dinner. I talked to people. And I wasn\u2019\
  t scared anymore.\n\nI had a few stops in that trip and more unexpected events in\
  \ Rome, in Turin\u2026 But when I came back, I was closer to what I am now. I started\
  \ to pay attention to the girl who wanted to become a novelist and I started to\
  \ write. Eight years and a novel, a script and a bunch of short stories after, I\
  \ became a woman, a writer. A living clich\xE9."
