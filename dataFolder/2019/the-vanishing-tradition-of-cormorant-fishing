Text: "The late afternoon sky looks rather murky. The muddy waters of the Li River\
  \ churn in the erratic wind that blows in.  Hwang, my boatman, stops paddling and\
  \ points towards the corrugated ridges of the Karst mountains to our north. At the\
  \ point where the bluish contours of the mountains seem to merge into the river,\
  \ a couple of bamboo rafts bounce in the water, slowly moving towards us.\n\n I\
  \ am at Yangshuo in the Guangxi province of South China. A moody town with the breathtaking\
  \ landscape of Karst mountains around it, Yangshuo is also one of the last places\
  \ to have a glimpse of the disappearing art of fishing with cormorants. For over\
  \ a millennium, the local fishermen have sailed across the tranquil Li river without\
  \ using a rod, hook or a bait. They have lived a life amid a world of water, reeds\
  \ and the small islands with their specially trained winged fleet. Now this ancient\
  \ craft of fishing is almost gone and the remaining practitioners mostly serve the\
  \ tourism industry.  Their children will not take up this method of fishing.\n\n\
  Hwang explains the technique. \u2018The fishermen tie a loose hemp-made collar around\
  \ the throat of the cormorant, which they train for years to catch fish from the\
  \ water. The snare prevents the bird from swallowing their catch and the fishermen\
  \ retrieve the fish when they come back to the boats.\u2019\n\nThe bamboo dinghies\
  \ arrive shortly. Four cormorants, looking dignified in their black plumage and\
  \ white crests, are sitting patiently in the bows of the boats. The two rowers are\
  \ wiry middle-aged men sporting the classic goatee, handmade fishing jackets and\
  \ conical hats. They throw me quick smiles and light up the boat lanterns. Their\
  \ avian companions watch the proceedings in mild amusement, gently flapping their\
  \ large wings. \n\nThe fishermen scoop up the birds and cry out in a strange, piercing\
  \ falsetto. The cormorants immediately toss themselves into the river and bob up\
  \ and down with the gentle tide. The fishermen hit the water with the crude oars\
  \ and begin hollering a chant. And the birds are suddenly gone, diving into the\
  \ depths of the dark waters. As if piloted by an intangible communication, the bamboo\
  \ dinghies follow their trail. Hwang rapidly rows our boat to keep pace with the\
  \ watery drama. A few hundred yards into the river, the fishermen stop and with\
  \ a sudden swoosh, a couple of birds emerge out of the river. One of them is struggling\
  \ with a rather large fish. A fisherman throws a net over the birds and hoists them\
  \ up on the deck. He takes out the wriggling carp from a cormorant\u2019s beak and\
  \ whistles softly. The bird stiffens and noiselessly sputters out two more fish\
  \ from its throat. Taking the cue, its partner delivers its catch, a couple of midsized\
  \ carp, from its windpipe onto the deck.\n\nBoth the birds get a few small fish\
  \ as rewards, which they gobble up. Huang tells me that cormorants can keep an approximate\
  \ score of the fish they catch and if they are not compensated for their efforts,\
  \ they would refuse to dive. \nIt has got quite dark and it would be impossible\
  \ to follow the hunt any longer. I thank the fishermen, who, Hwang tells me, are\
  \ two brothers. With a deep bow, the men steer their boats further into the river.\
  \ Two more cormorants are waiting for their masters somewhere in the middle of the\
  \ Li river."
