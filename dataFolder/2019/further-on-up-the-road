Text: "\u201CJust five more minutes and we can turn around if we don\u2019t see our\
  \ turn. How does that sound?\u201D, I asked my wife as we drove along a road to\
  \ what seemed like nowhere on the north side of Hawaii\u2019s Big Island. \n What\
  \ would it hurt? We were on our honeymoon in a new place and feeling spontaneous,\
  \ and I couldn\u2019t help but think about what we were missing that was right around\
  \ the corner. The warm air and golden sun rushing into the cab of our rental jeep\
  \ didn\u2019t do anything to discourage us from turning around. We never get this\
  \ kind of weather in November back home, so we wanted to soak up every minute of\
  \ it. \u201CActually, could you stop at the next place you see? I need to walk around\
  \ a bit and stretch my legs\u201D, my wife responded.  \nAfter acknowledging that\
  \ I would stop, I started thinking about how we had spent a whole day of our one-week\
  \ honeymoon, one we would never get back, just driving around this huge island.\
  \ We had to find something to do that could salvage the day. As the regret started\
  \ to settle in and I tried to recall anything I\u2019d seen to do on the hundreds\
  \ of itineraries, I noticed a small building surrounded by the start of what appeared\
  \ to be a rainforest. The sign on the building informed us that it was the Kohala\
  \ Welcome Center.  Only one car was parked outside as we pulled in. I was sure we\
  \ were on the edge of the island\u2019s civilization and this was the last stop.\
  \  \nOnce we stretched for a bit, we decided to head back to the car, but the word\
  \ \u201Cmaps\u201D in the window of the center caught my attention. I decided to\
  \ linger for a bit and check it out since I had earlier decided to collect maps\
  \ of the area to frame one day. Upon entering, the first thing that caught my attention\
  \ was a massive canvas photo of a black sand beach and a series of cliffs that turned\
  \ into valleys. \u201CThat\u2019s awesome\u201D, I said out loud, not really meaning\
  \ to. \u201CHoneymoon?\u201D I turned and looked to where I heard the soft voice\
  \ inquire from behind me. A lady was sitting in a rocker. She appeared to be in\
  \ her late 60\u2019s but wore a youth and vibrancy that the island somehow adorned\
  \ on everyone. \u201CYes, ma\u2019am\u201D I replied. \u201CCongratulations! I\u2019\
  m Mrs. Annie. I moved here from Northern California.\u201D, she said. \u201CIf you\
  \ go further on up the road, that\u2019s what you will see.\u201D \nShe pointed\
  \ at the picture. \u201CReally?\u201D, My wife and I both asked in disbelief. \u201C\
  Yes, but first you have to stop in the town of Kapaau and see our statue of King\
  \ Kamehameha. It was the original that was lost at sea but found in 1912 and brought\
  \ out of the sea.\u201D \n Once we arrived in Kapaau, we navigated the streets of\
  \ wooden shops until we found the famous statue. He stood looking over the land\
  \ with one hand outstretched, pointing us onward. We reached the end of the road\
  \ and pulled off into a sea of other cars and made our way along the path that was\
  \ carved into the ground by previous adventurers. What we were looking for we couldn\u2019\
  t see until about halfway down the path. It was the actual version of the giant\
  \ picture at the welcome center. My wife and I stood there amazed. \u201CIt\u2019\
  s even better at the bottom!\u201D, someone called out. We knew we had to keep going.\
  \ \nWe spent hours at the bottom sitting on the black sand beach, building driftwood\
  \ huts, and letting the clear water run over our feet. I was thankful we had driven\
  \ and not done anything else this day or else I would\u2019ve missed what was right\
  \ around the corner. I was thankful Mrs. Annie pointed us in the right direction.\
  \  As I thought about this, for a moment I thought I could see Kamehameha in the\
  \ distance with his outstretched arm waving me on and urging me to look for adventure\
  \ in life where I might least expect it."
