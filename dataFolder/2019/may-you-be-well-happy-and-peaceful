Text: "It felt like going back in time. The moment I put my hand in the box pulling\
  \ out a white piece of paper, written back in Summer of 2017: \u201CMay you be well,\
  \ happy and peaceful\u201D.\n\nAnd so I left the note on the fridge of my new apartment,\
  \ partly covered by magnets traveled to my refrigerator door from Warsaw, Prague,\
  \ Bali, Berlin, Rome. No, I haven\u2019t been in Bali. That was a gift from my ex\
  \ boss when he came back from his honeymoon trip there. That magnet of a surfboard\
  \ was the only kind gesture he ever made towards me. But that\u2019s not the point.\n\
  \nThat note is the last thing I expected to find in an October evening of 2018,\
  \ while unpacking stuff from boxes hermetically sealed 11 months now. It has been\
  \ buried in that box together with some magnets from various trips, since the days\
  \ we broke up and I left your apartment of light and air.\n\nAnd so I am back in\
  \ the Summer of 2017. Around 7 in the morning, listening to this Buddhist Monk speaking\
  \ his kind words in a spacious, airy, sunny hall while he is guiding us to our first\
  \ mindfulness meditation session ever. And then I can hear him repeating these words\
  \ on the day we are vacating this soothing place, after he asked you to help him\
  \ pot some kind of plant and leaving in our hands two seeds, prompting us to plant\
  \ them with love and care back in our flat\u2019s terrace.\n\nCeylon was an apocalypse\
  \ indeed. Partly, the kind of Pandora's box one. This trip was supposed to be a\
  \ valuable present. Reality was proven kind of a curse. I remember how I couldn\u2019\
  t get used to the fact that it was getting dark by 6pm. Our life in the Mediterranean\
  \ was full of light and I got used to be lighten by the sun. And you have been my\
  \ sun, until this trip to Sri Lanka begun to reveal the contrary. We stayed under\
  \ the discreet burning sun of Sri Lanka for fifteen days and fourteen nights. Until\
  \ we finally got blackened. Still, I can feel the humidity of this Ceylonese city\
  \ of green, I can smell this peaceful jungle of curry, I can see these women of\
  \ saris and hear these men with tuk-tuks, I can warm my heart with their bright\
  \ smiles, cheer up by their colourful clothes and walls, soothe myself with their\
  \ ginger tea, be amazed by madame Helga\u2019s Folly and gaze the monkeys stealing\
  \ people\u2019s food by the lake: I am in Kandy.\n\nAnd Kandy was a revelation.\
  \ The fact that it was 'getting late\u2019 was at the same time a curse and a blessing.\
  \ We were staying at a Meditation and Retreat Centre placed at the top of the mountains\
  \ of Kandy, immersed in nature, where we could only listen to the birds singing\
  \ and wake up in a room surrounded with window walls giving us the stunning expansive\
  \ views of green and the city. Magic. \n\nI was getting ready to go to bed. You\
  \ were smoking one of our last cigarettes in the terrace while I heard you calling\
  \ my name with a sense of excitement. The same excitement you had when you were\
  \ calling my name two months back - in Paphos, while you were smoking in another\
  \ hotel\u2019s terrace, inviting me to share the moment of sunrise with you. Well\
  \ this time it wasn\u2019t the sun leaving. It was already dark and you invited\
  \ me to share this visit of fireflies. So magical. So unforgettable. A moment I\
  \ surely didn\u2019t expect to find. If a song equaled this moment it would be \u201C\
  Riptide\u201D sung by you, back in our living room. So, I cherish this moment of\
  \ apocalypse. I keep it in my heart and I burry the rest of it in the Pandora box.\n\
  \nAnd as I smoke my cigarette, staring at the city buildings of Nicosia covering\
  \ your terrace - the one we got used to lay on summer nights reading books and looking\
  \ a terrace of another building catching fire - I wish \u201CMay you be well, happy\
  \ and peaceful\u201D\u2026\n\nFrom Kandy, with love."
