Text: No lhamas, the preffix "Inca" being used for promotional things, the terrible
  traffic and not a single day of raining. On the other hand, so many things that
  remind me Brazil, agradable weather, beautiful places and a delicious drink called
  Pisco. That was a little bit about my first impressions on my leap into the unknown
  at Lima, Peru. My uncle Rodrigo is working at the Panamericano that will occur at
  the city in this year. So I went there in order to visit him, in the first place.
  He told me good things about the region, and my expectations were high. But I didn't
  knew that I'd feel so nauseous since I stepped at Lima Airport. The pressure is
  so different from Brazil, so I felt bad until the second day of the trip. Anyway,
  it didn't bothered me to enjoying all that the city could offer me, Rodrigo brought
  me to a shopping called Larcomar, that stays right next a gourgeous beach, and there's
  no ceiling to allow people enjoying the view. On the following day, we went to Paracas,
  a place which stays three hours from Lima, to visit a desert where the wind blows
  all the time, and its near from the sea. It was one of the most beautiful places
  I've been in all my life. The plan was staying three days in Paracas, so we stood
  at the best hotel of the place, it was in the middle of an Oasis. I certainly would
  come back to Peru, but I want to know Machu Picchu next time.
