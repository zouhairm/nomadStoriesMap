Text: "I opened my eyes to the sound of something munching grass outside my tent.\
  \ I unzipped the front door to find a dozen pairs of eyes staring back at me. The\
  \ cows looked as confused about my presence as I was theirs. They had not been there\
  \ last night. Surrounded by incredible snowy peaks that towered above 7,000 metres\
  \ in the Tien Shan mountain range in Kyrgyzstan, I was completely alone, except\
  \ for these curious cows who were now licking the outside of my tent. This was probably\
  \ my cue to get up and start walking.\n   \n    As I was making my way to the beginning\
  \ of the trail the previous morning, an elderly couple had kindly picked me up in\
  \ their battered minivan. The big lime green pack on my back must have caused them\
  \ to pity me; it was incredibly warm and I was sweating profusely already. The limited\
  \ basic Russian I knew helped me to communicate with the couple, as we bobbed along\
  \ the dusty dirt road leading to the trailhead. To our left I could see a desert,\
  \ with jagged rock formations jutting out of the sand, the gleaming summer sun amplifying\
  \ their reddish tinge. The heat and the scenery made it impossible to imagine that\
  \ the next day I would wake up to the cold grass glistening in a blanket of frost.\
  \ \n\n    The first day of the hike was quite strenuous and the path wasn\u2019\
  t very clear, but I managed to stay on track with my offline maps app. I kept shaking\
  \ my head at the scenery I was witnessing along the way, enjoying how miniscule\
  \ I felt peering up at these gargantuan mountains. Just when I thought that it couldn\u2019\
  t become any more picturesque, I spotted a herd of wild horses, grazing in the grass,\
  \ the snow-capped mountains serving as a surreal backdrop. I arrived at a vast open\
  \ space just below Ala-Archa pass where I would spend the night, without another\
  \ soul in sight. The tent I had just set up looked insignificant in contrast to\
  \ the overwhelming grandeur of the pass I needed to traverse the next day. It would\
  \ be a challenge, but I was looking forward to seeing what was on the other side.\
  \ The silence of my surroundings was almost eerie on this cold night. A certain\
  \ calmness enveloped me as I fell asleep with a smile on my face.\n\n   After wading\
  \ my way through the herd of cows and successfully ascending the steep pass the\
  \ following morning, I began to descend back towards civilization. Every step was\
  \ as breathtaking as the next, passing through lush valleys and green meadows. A\
  \ few moments after making the realization that I had gone around 24 hours without\
  \ seeing anyone, I encountered an unexpected obstacle. As I approached a small hut\
  \ with animals roaming around the backyard, a surprisingly wide glacial river was\
  \ blocking my path. The icy blue waist-deep waters were flowing rapidly. I was cursing\
  \ my maps app for not demonstrating the width of the river when a rugged, long-haired\
  \ man appeared on the other side of the river. He crossed over to where I was standing,\
  \ motioned for me to jump on his horse and proceeded to carry me across the increasingly\
  \ strong current. I hopped off the horse and carried on to find shelter for my tent\
  \ under a tree near a nomadic yurt camp. Before settling in for the night, a few\
  \ giddy children gathered around my tent and simultaneously erupted in a fit of\
  \ giggles any time I opened my mouth. Once again, I slept peacefully, despite the\
  \ cold resulting from still being at quite high altitude. \n\n    The next day I\
  \ would walk another 20 kilometres on much flatter, but equally beautiful terrain\
  \ to finish this astonishing hike and head off on my next adventure. I could only\
  \ hope that this experience would serve as a reminder that as a solo female, I needn\u2019\
  t hold back from doing what I want to do. It felt intimidating to go on this trek\
  \ alone, but deciding to plunge headfirst into the unknown of this seldom travelled\
  \ path rewarded me with an unforgettable experience and a great story to tell."
