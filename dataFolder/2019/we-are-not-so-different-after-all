Text: "In 2014 I had the chance to study Mandarin Chinese in the province of Hunan,\
  \ China. Before heading there, I was a little bit anxious. Actually, I was very\
  \ anxious! I was thinking of all the differences and the language barrier I would\
  \ encounter. Would I be able to communicate? Make friends? \nDon\u2019t get me wrong,\
  \ I had traveled abroad before, but I just didn\u2019t know exactly what to expect.\
  \ Nonetheless, that feeling didn\u2019t frighten me. It encouraged me to embark\
  \ on a journey towards the unknown.\nOnce I arrived in China, I started noticing\
  \ the differences. I truly believe this was mutual since they would stare at me\
  \ while I was eating, just to see if I could use the chopsticks properly. LOL!\n\
  Food was one big difference, but that doesn\u2019t mean it was bad. As a matter\
  \ of fact, I loved it. Although it took me a while to get used to the spiciness\
  \ and taste of stinky tofu.\nApart from the food, there were indeed some other differences.\
  \ However, from certain point on I switched a button in my brain \u2013 probably\
  \ automatically \u2013 and I started paying attention to the similarities instead.\n\
  What could a Brazilian citizen have in common with Chinese nationals?\nWhile I lived\
  \ in China, I played soccer pretty much every week! Chinese really love sports,\
  \ soccer included. The best friends I made were inside the pitch and I talk to them\
  \ to this day.\nAnother similarity I noticed the most is in the family realm. Around\
  \ the end of January 2015, the Chinese New Year was approaching us and one friend\
  \ of mine invited me to spend the holidays in his house, in the province of Hainan.\
  \ By the way, Hainan is a wonderful island, especially for those trying to escape\
  \ the cold winter like me.\nComing back to the subject, my friend had a big family\
  \ living in houses close by. They seemed very happy to receive me in their home.\
  \ I felt like I made part of their family right away, even though I couldn\u2019\
  t communicate very well at that time.\nAfter spending some days there, I realized\
  \ that spending the Chinese New Year with them was like spending Christmas with\
  \ my own family in some ways. We ate and drank a lot of food together and we wished\
  \ ourselves the best. Of course, during the Chinese New Year you don\u2019t receive\
  \ gifts, but Hong Bao instead (a red envelope with money inside).\nWell, at the\
  \ end of my one-year study program in China it really broke my heart to say goodbye.\
  \ The truth is that it didn\u2019t matter if we were different or similar in some\
  \ ways because, at the end of the day, our curiosity has driven us to communicate,\
  \ get to know and respect each other. It allowed me to interact, befriend, fall\
  \ in love and break my heart when leaving.\nI guess, experience the unexpected is\
  \ the best thing we can do to ourselves when traveling. Sometimes, having no guides\
  \ to follow, results in the best outcome we could have ever experienced."
