Text: 'I was in Venice on a tour that only lasted 8 hours. My sister told me she would
  wait for me after I finished my trip in a gondola and I left. I got off the boat,
  and I could not find it anywhere.


  I waited about half an hour and she did not show up. I started walking and at that
  time (2008) there were no smartphones with GPS or whatsapp to communicate, so I
  figured that Venice was not that big and, of course, I got lost.


  While walking I saw many alleys and beautiful bridges, but the most incredible thing
  was a small chapel in the middle of nowhere.


  I entered and began to see tons of violins, cellos and musical instruments and I
  was surprised when I discovered where it was: it was a chapel completely dedicated
  to Vivaldi.


  I stayed there for almost 2 hours reading all the stories and seeing all the instruments
  I played when I was alive. It was the best discovery of all!


  When I finally left, I followed the signs to Piazza San Marco and found my sister
  there with the rest of the group, but I will never forget that little chapel and
  my adventure in Venice.'
