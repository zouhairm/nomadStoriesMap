Text: "A leap into the unknown. A leap outside of the cozy, familiar borders of Europe\
  \ into the bigger world. This is the story about how I faced my fear of flying and\
  \ about how, as Italo Calvino wrote, \u201Cyou take delight not in a city's seven\
  \ or seventy wonders, but in the answer it gives to a question of yours\u201D. And\
  \ that question for me was: Can I do it? Can I really be on an airplane for 10 hours?\
  \ Read: how far out of my comfort zone can I push myself?\n\nHaving moved from my\
  \ small Italian hometown to Berlin in 2014, I had somehow given the people around\
  \ me the impression that I was a brave young woman always ready for the next adventure.\
  \ The truth is, I was still a terribly anxious person, relying on a strict routine\
  \ to make sense of the world and keep with my fears at bay. The biggest of which\
  \ was the fear of flying, that didn\u2019t seem to go away despite my frequent flights\
  \ between Italy and Germany. \n\nThings suddenly changed when an incredible travel\
  \ opportunity presented itself to me in April 2018. I was employed in the video\
  \ production department of a travel company when I received the task of visiting\
  \ Bird Island, a minuscule piece of land in the middle of the Indian Ocean, in order\
  \ to make drone videos of the destination. There was just one problem: getting there\
  \ would require a 10-hour flight to the Seychelles followed by a 30-minute flight\
  \ on a small propellor plane. \n\nTrust me, the irony of a drone pilot being scared\
  \ of flying is not lost on me. What makes things even more ironic is that I was\
  \ going to visit Bird Island: home to tens of thousands of birds, the lords of the\
  \ sky, the masters of flying. It seemed as if the universe was trying to send me\
  \ a sign: \u201Cyou can fly too!\u201D. So I took a deep breath and I stepped on\
  \ the airplane.\n\nIt\u2019s hard to describe Bird Island without using clich\xE9\
  s. Yes, it is like being in a postcard, the sand really is that white, the water\
  \ really that warm and turquoise. The vegetation is otherworldly, birds rest on\
  \ your shoulders, giant tortoises roam free\u2026 I could describe every single\
  \ square meter of this tiny little island and I would have something new to say\
  \ about each of them. \n\nWhen I arrived there, I already knew that I, as a human\
  \ being, am only passing through, while the Earth is here to stay; while that\u2019\
  s not really something I reflect upon very often, it was all I could think about\
  \ as soon as I set foot on the island. Looking at the night sky and seeing the Milky\
  \ Way, so bright and so near, I suddenly realised how small and insignificant I\
  \ was. Although it\u2019s probably not going to look good on the \u201Ccustomer\
  \ reviews\u201D section of the Bird Island website, that sensation really is the\
  \ thing for which I\u2019m most grateful to the Island.\n\nI wish I could say that\
  \ since that I\u2019m not scared of flying anymore, but I would be lying: what I\
  \ can tell you, however, is that I\u2019m a little less scared, because I saw where\
  \ flying \u2013 and facing your fears \u2013 can take you."
