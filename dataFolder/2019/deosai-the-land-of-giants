Text: "\"Wow! Look there!\" said I, to myself, when i had the first sight of Sheosar\
  \ Lake, Deosai, Skardu, Pakistan. I had just crossed a small hill and put foot into\
  \    Deosai, as Sheosar Lake marks the beginning of this deserted, world's second\
  \ highest plateau. Hills on the three sides and a giant plateau in the other, \n\
  Sheosar Lake stood there like a pearl in the shell. Clear blue sky, with clouds\
  \ floating fast; plateau stretching all the way long to horizon, with lovely flowers,\
  \ had me taken into them. Sitting on the edge, I wondered what other thing would\
  \ be heaven, if it isn't this place, right in front of me.\n\n      Although it\
  \ was really hard to leave that place yet my destiny was yet a long way into the\
  \ wild, where bears, leopards and birds resided. I started moving towards the plateau,\
  \ flowers could be seen all around with green bed everywhere. The streams of water\
  \ in the middle of the plateau were adding to the beauty. I kept on walking and\
  \ found a bear baby far in the east. I wondered how the creature is living in this\
  \ harsh weather with scarcity of anything edible. The trek continued and the nature\
  \ kept on bestowing me with the wonders of the mountains, streams and flowers. \n\
  \n       I had surely found myself while wandering in that unknown placed, it seemed\
  \ as if I had not known myself before coming here, that I belong here and not in\
  \ the hustle of the busy city life. I felt extremely motivated as I moved towards\
  \ the last lake of the area. Even today, sitting in my cabin at my workplace, whenever\
  \ I find myself stranded, I recall the Deosai experience and convince myself that\
  \ overcoming the difficulties will give me reward like none other, as I had there\
  \ in that deserted place. The zeal which it invigorates is like nothing else in\
  \ the world, travelling indeed invokes you to find the unknown you."
