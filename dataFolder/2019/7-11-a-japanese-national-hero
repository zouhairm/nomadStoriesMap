Text: "When people think about Japan, they recall the country\u2019s rich history\
  \ with the temples, samurai and tatami mat flooring. They see the modern city \u2013\
  \ flashing lights of its capital megacity Tokyo and the unbeatable speed of shinkansen\
  \ bullet trains. They see the wacky and the wonderful of the Harajuku girls, cosplayers\
  \ in the streets and bizarre attractions like the Robot Restaurant.\n\nConvenience\
  \ stores (\u2018konbini\u2019, in Japanese \u2013 a borrowed word shortening a phoneticised\
  \ form of the English \u2018convenience\u2019) aren\u2019t necessarily one of the\
  \ first things that come to mind for most people when they think about Japan, but\
  \ they really should be. The culture around convenience stores is actually one of\
  \ the most striking cultural differences between Japan and the rest of the globalised\
  \ world.\n\nOn a post-high school graduation trip, my best friend and I were on\
  \ a tight budget during a three week to Japan and the abundance of konbini single-handedly\
  \ rescued us from ever being without access to food or drink. \n\nWhere some people\
  \ might see 21st century, urban clutter-filled hell, convenience stores are the\
  \ saving grace of any traveller or local in Japan. In a Japanese context, the word\
  \ convenience in the title of these shops is no misnomer. Japan has konbini of every\
  \ shape and size on the corner of every street.\n\nIn any other country, I turn\
  \ up my nose at the pre-made food at convenience stores. It\u2019s a hard pass,\
  \ especially on the sandwiches, crushed in their wrapping with the stale, but simultaneously\
  \ soggy, day old bread. In Japan however, convenience store food is a source of\
  \ pre-packaged joy. There are even businessmen and families hanging around the seats\
  \ of the konbinis for a snack or quick meal.\n\nKonbinis exist in abundance to save\
  \ you. Maybe you need a quick meal on the way home from a busy day of sightseeing.\
  \ Possibly a snack in the middle of such a day. Perhaps you just need to pop in\
  \ for a minute to use their heated indoors to warm up a little after being in the\
  \ cold winter weather all day.\n\nWhen my friend and I missed the breakfast offered\
  \ with our budget hotel room, a Lawson\u2019s convenience store around the corner\
  \ provided us with breakfast: egg sandwiches. Initially, we\u2019d begrudgingly\
  \ bought this sandwich expecting the pungent smell and rubbery texture of boiled\
  \ eggs that have been left out too long. But, won over by the crystalline plastic\
  \ packaging displaying fluffy white sandwiches in a brightly lit section on the\
  \ fridge shelf, we bought them anyway. The bread was soft and the egg salad fresh\
  \ and mixed with delicious Japanese mayo. The egg sandwiches we had that first morning\
  \ were the first of many to come.\n\nAlmost two weeks later and hitting the mid-trip\
  \ slump while being away from home for Christmas for the first time, we decided\
  \ to splurge a little. \u2018Little\u2019 being the operative word in this scenario,\
  \ a trip to the convenience store near our hostel let us exchange gifts on a \xA5\
  300 (3.40 AUD) budget. We scored a little slice of home in this shop, but only because\
  \ we were in Japan. I came out with a small box of chocolate biscuits and a roll\
  \ of cookies, while I gave my friend a travel-sized tube of Kewpie mayo, a packet\
  \ of chocolates and a daifuku (a traditional Japanese, red bean stuffed rice cake\
  \ dessert). The box of chocolates I received, by itself, costs upwards of $5 in\
  \ Asian supermarkets in Australia, so receiving two snacks on our \xA5300 budget\
  \ was truly a Christmas miracle.\n\nWe were able to explore local flavours, get\
  \ some free street-side warmth and even purchase lip balm when the winter air had\
  \ made this a desperate need. While we\u2019d gone to Japan hoping to embrace the\
  \ culture, part of the trip was to learn that in Japan, whether it be a standalone\
  \ building with a carpark or in amongst traditional houses and shops, there\u2019\
  s no place in the world where the fluorescent lights of a 7/11 store is such a welcome\
  \ sight to all."
