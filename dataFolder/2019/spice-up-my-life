Text: "Austin was a pleasant surprise for a Brazilian girl, used to see everything\
  \ of every kind. But the capital of the conservative Texas in nothing resembles\
  \ the white trash we see on the news. \n\nInstead we find a pan with a mix of culture,\
  \ the perfect pinch of technology spiced up with a spoonful of music. \n\nBut that\u2019\
  s not the most interesting part of this. The keyword there is SHARE. \n\nIf we see\
  \ the culture of sharing as part of the future, in the capital of The Lone Star\
  \ that is the present. The concern about others and the planet is in all around\
  \ - from the trash cans divided into recyclable and compostable to the habit of\
  \ biking. \n\nA big city with economic interests, drowned in technology and which\
  \ is named by many as the new Silicon Valley but still manage to deal with people\
  \ and their differences in a special way is nothing but magical. \n\nMagic that\
  \ is not in monuments of worldwide known landscapes, but that leaks from every pore\
  \ of a chunky but comfortable mix of rednecks, latinos and foreigner students. \
  \ \n\nAmong the notes of blues, country music, Latin rhythms and rock\u2019n roll\
  \ the city goes in an invisible dance that lead you to think life is good and a\
  \ better world is possible. \n\nAdd to it the best food in United States, the kindest\
  \ service and a population with no fear of human exchange and you will be served\
  \ the best of both worlds: the growth of North America and the sweetness of Latin\
  \ America. \n\nIn times of crowdfunding and collaborative politics, is correct to\
  \ tell that Austin is foreseeing a new era in human relations: the friendfunding."
