Text: "I am Julia and I have already lived in Kuala Lumpur 1 year. This city called\
  \ one of the fast developing in Asia. But in case of travelling here is not a lot\
  \ things to do. The best choice to visit city - it is when you flight somewhere\
  \ else (Like Indonesia, Singapore, Thailand) and just choose 2 days layover in KL.\
  \ This time more than enough to visit all \"must see\" points. \nSo let`s start\
  \ my plan \"What to do in KL for 2 days?\":\n1) First, I recommend to start from\
  \ Batu Caves, as they are situated far from the City Center and it takes around\
  \ 1,5 hour to get there (if you use train; not sure that taxi will be faster - as\
  \ in KL is high traffic). The main cave is free, also there are some proposition\
  \ for extra payment. This place will be interesting for adults and children. \n\
  P.S. You should wear which will cover your legs and decollete. But If you do not\
  \ have it, there staff can provide scarf for money.  \n2) After - visit China Town,\
  \ where you can find thousands unnecessary things, which you want to buy. It is\
  \ very juicy place and common for Malaysia, as almost 35% of native livers is originally\
  \ form China.\n3) Slowly we move to Bukit Bintang - kind of night market with street\
  \ food. In this place, must try is king of fruits - Durian. You will smell it far\
  \ away from exact location.If it impossible for you, than order main traditional\
  \ food - Nasi Lemak. It is rice, boiled in coconut milk, with chicken, peanuts,\
  \ anchovies, cucumber and spice sauce.\n4) Evening come, and now time to one and\
  \ the most important one - visit Petronas Twin Tower. They are amazing. And in front\
  \ of the shopping mall, there are a guy who selling adorable grilled corn with coconut\
  \ water and chili powder. Take this corn and visit garden from another side of Twin\
  \ Towers to enjoy tasty snack and amazing view.\n\nThe next day, it is time to shopping.\
  \ In the capital of Malaysia represented almost all famous brand. Everyone can find\
  \ suitable for themselves. With this reason must visit Suria KLCC (shopping mall\
  \ in Twin Tower) and Pavillion (one of the biggest in Asia). \nI do not recommend\
  \ you to visit view point in the Twins Tower - as view is not so good and you have\
  \ to book it in 4-5 days before, Better choose famous bar Marinis, which situated\
  \ on 51 floor. From this place you can see Towers - and they are the main on whole\
  \ landscape of KL.\n\nAnd finish this day better in Rama V restaurant. Thai cuisine\
  \ is the best in Asia and this restaurant cooking it unbelievable. \n\nTime to go\
  \ back to the airport. Have fun and follow my trip list!"
