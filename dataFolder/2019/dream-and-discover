Text: "For the past two years I have gone on mission trips to the Dominican Republic\
  \ and it has change my life. I had never been out of the country before and I knew\
  \ almost no Spanish whatsoever. I discovered so many things, about myself and about\
  \ the world around me, that I never knew before. The rest of the world is different\
  \ from anything one would see in the United States. The culture, the security, the\
  \ laws, the geography, and even what they normally eat; it is completely unique\
  \ from every other country in the world. \nI went a second time in 2018 and I had\
  \ even more to discover. New foods, new people to meet, and new relationships to\
  \ create with the people around me. \nThe moment I stepped foot on the first plane,\
  \ I knew that this opportunity would change my life. These trips solidified my future\
  \ dreams of traveling the world and learning so much more. I have gotten the chance\
  \ to go to Guatemala in 2019 and my heart can\u2019t wait to explore the world more\
  \ and to learn so many more things. \nEverywhere I have traveled, I have kept keepsakes\
  \ and seemingly hundreds of pictures to remember these trips. \nTo go along with\
  \ my passion of travel and learning, I have always had a strong love of writing.\
  \ I currently write short stories and poetry and I have been since my 6th grade\
  \ year. A combined trip for my two passions is like a dream that hopefully I will\
  \ one day achieve, no matter what."
