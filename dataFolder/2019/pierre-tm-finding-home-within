Text: "Turning 40, was a beginning of an amazing time in my life. It was the start\
  \ of something new. I began a new mission in life. One I can only celebrate for\
  \ the first time, every time till I face 50 in the eye head-on. \n\nI am on a mission\
  \ to venture into the new unknown- 20 new nations over the span of 10 years. One\
  \ for every birthday; one for every step into a new chapter of life. I believe to\
  \ truly love life- is to be freaking hungry. In my pursuit  a fuller experience,\
  \ on that is uninterrupted and always hungry for more. \n\nThe journey began last\
  \ Spring as I high fived my dear long time friend, Pierre Boutinon. While we trekked\
  \ across Switzerland, a country more beautiful, more accommodating in person than\
  \ expressed in any book or journal I ever read. I rediscovered my lost fascination\
  \ in its castles and scenic views. I woke up every morning to a quiet breeze and\
  \ the sudden emphatic sound of a donkey calling its mate. The air is pure, food\
  \ local- made with attention.\n\nI was happy. I was home.\n\nAt first glance, people\
  \ are polite; cultured, kind and hardworking. Seen through their eyes, the Swiss\
  \ are not overworked. They are compensated fairly and rewarded for their hardships.\
  \ The weather was pleasant, clouds pillow-like and the skies blue. I pinched myself\
  \ a few times making sure this wasn\u2019t a figment of my imagination. It has happened\
  \ before, not knowing what the next corner will reveal. We trekked further into\
  \ the hilltops and valleys, meeting new people and savouring new foods. Pierre lived\
  \ in Switzerland for 6 consecutive years. He never saw Switzerland the way I had\
  \ seen Switzerland. He connected only to the country he had been living in. We had\
  \ a brief visit at the French border just to be turned around for their own reasoning.\
  \ We reconnected to my younger inner self- a child in Austria. There is a clear\
  \ distinction between the two sides of me, Switzerland and Austria when it comes\
  \ to bystanders. The view was just as peaceful if not majestic. I miss Austria,\
  \ as much as I miss my childhood. \n\nBefore arriving at Germany over great beers\
  \ and Austrian wieners, we detoured into untouched domain - Liechtenstein. A tiny\
  \ nation surrounded by the Alps with no border security or customs; we entered,\
  \ meandered and explored; all in awe. My camera captured every moment and I still\
  \ remember each one to this day as if it were yesterday. Their coffees were real,\
  \ roasted and bold with cream on the side as you choose- peel back, pour over, stir\
  \ and sip. This was the norm there. Women naturally offered cheek kisses as a greeting\
  \ without reservation. \n\nDuring the very end of my trip, I prepared a look back\
  \ at what I had discovered and who I became. Weight lifted- I was whole and rejuvenated.\
  \ Eyes wide open I gave Canada another chance. One I can celebrate, uninterrupted\
  \ and always hungry. \n\nIn the end, I am now one with myself - happy, content and\
  \ hungry for my next adventure."
