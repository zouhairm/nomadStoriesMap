Text: "Going to Ireland, my mom and I knew we wanted to stay a night in Dingle. From\
  \ our Rick Steve's Best of Ireland tour guide to friends' recommendations, we heard\
  \ of the small town in its namesake peninsula, which has a residency of about 2,000\
  \ people year-round but boasts one of the best food and traditional music scenes\
  \ throughout the Emerald Isle.  Wanting to lose ourselves from the N86 highway,\
  \ we took the scenic route to Castlegregory and Ballycurrane on the north shore\
  \ of the peninsula, the coastal towns quieter now that Autumn had finally nestled\
  \ in. As we got out of the brisk sea-scented wind of the beaches and into our powder-blue\
  \ Kia, one we promptly named Blue, we made our way south on R560 towards Dingle.\
  \ Little did we realize, this route goes through the steep mountains that create\
  \ a natural divider within the peninsula, and is also home to a section of road\
  \ named the Conor Pass.\n\nThe Conor Pass is Ireland's highest mountain pass, measuring\
  \ 1,345 feet above sea level. On a clear day, you can see the Skellig Islands off\
  \ the tip of the Kerry Peninsula, and if you squint your eyes, you can even make\
  \ out the distant shape of An Tran, the most southern of the Aran Islands. Of course\
  \ with this kind of view comes with a couple of hiccups. The pass has a strict weight\
  \ limit of 2 tons, as well as length and width restrictions, and it is also closed\
  \ during the winter due to inclement weather. The pass is not for the faint of heart,\
  \ as it lies in the middle of the mountainside and is one lane wide.  Don't fret\
  \ though; there are signs keeping you aware of when the next \"passing\" section\
  \ is, which are only wide enough for you to get over so the oncoming traffic can\
  \ go by you, though some of those signs run a risk of falling off the cliff.\n\n\
  Yea, we must have skipped that part of our guide books, because by the time we parked\
  \ at the last car-park on the northern side of the mountain and saw the road that\
  \ laid before us, we knew we were too far to turn back and go around the mountain.\
  \ And besides, we were in Ireland for an adventure, right? As we crept along the\
  \ path, already going at least 10 km under the speed limit, we slowed down even\
  \ more as the road continued to narrow. Even inside our little Kia, I felt like\
  \ we didn't have enough room between the rocky facade of the mountain to my left,\
  \ and the sheer drop of the cliff to my right. I don't know if I've ever braced\
  \ myself so hard before, and by the time our car went under a small waterfall (a\
  \ mere two minutes into the pass), my mom and I were both laughing with hysterics.\
  \ Coming to our first passing section, my mom said to me \"Think we can turn around\
  \ now?\" I still believe she was only half-joking. \n\nThese antics continued for\
  \ the next five minutes; the pass really isn't that long, but it felt like an eternity,\
  \ especially when we had company that had four legs instead of four wheels as we\
  \ experienced first-hand the sheer stubborn-will of Ireland's unofficial mascot.\
  \ Mom kept yelling, \"Get out of my way or I swear I will hit you! F**king sheep!\"\
  \ We were laughing with a continuous stream of tears rolling down our faces as the\
  \ sheep finally, albeit slowly, walked out of our way down the side of the road.\n\
  \nAs we pulled into the car-park that marked our finish line of the Conor Pass,\
  \ our jaws dropped at the landscape before us. Steep mountains with green grass\
  \ flowing like hair with the breeze, broken up only by the brown patches of bog\
  \ and dark grey waters of the lakes that spotted the valley below, the mist escaping\
  \ from the clouds and sweeping between the peaks. And as we turned to see our destination\
  \ of Dingle, tucked into the bay in the valley below us, we knew we took the right\
  \ path for adventure."
