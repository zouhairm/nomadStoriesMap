Text: "Living the dream for a year in Sydney came to a painful and heartbreaking end,\
  \ therefore I\u2019m here once again packing my entire life in a suitcase and a\
  \ hand luggage and heading to the airport. Not sure how to gather myself because\
  \ this is so totally what I don\u2019t want to do, but my visa is over and I must\
  \ board that plane with direction Bali. \nAt the gate I\u2019m still quite puzzled,\
  \ but a glimpse of excitement finds its way into my system and I look a bit more\
  \ positively at my boarding pass that indicates a window seat. Lucky me, I get to\
  \ see the Opera House for a last time through the glass of the giant mobile cinema\
  \ departing the gorgeous Harbour city. \nBetween tears and stumbles I reach my seat\
  \ and the last thing I want is human interaction. I\u2019m mortified noticing that\
  \ someone takes a seat next to me because I really hoped to have a bit of a personal\
  \ space considering my very vulnerable state. I\u2019m even more shocked to notice\
  \ that my neighbor is greeting me with a sincere smile and a pleasant voice, which\
  \ kind of feels comforting.\nNaturally I try replying on the same tone but my forced\
  \ smile gives up my pretended happy mood and I hear : \u201C What\u2019s going on\
  \ with you?\u201D A few minutes into the flight, Jack, my new friend is already\
  \ listening to my Australia stories and sharing a few of his as well. He\u2019s\
  \ patient and positive, understanding and compassionate. I like the feeling and\
  \ I feel totally comfortable sharing more and more of my stories and I genuinely\
  \ feel understood and accepted. \nI\u2019m still unsure what sort of magic is he\
  \ using to make me laugh out loud, but certainly lifts my spirit considerably and\
  \ gives me another reason to appreciate the Aussie easygoingness that comes handy\
  \ when your mood is on the floor. \nJacks positivity is indeed contagious and I\
  \ already picture myself flying back to Sydney in the near future. \nOn the other\
  \ hand, it seems that I am managing to inspire a bit too, my Transylvanian origin\
  \ creating a funny atmosphere filled with hilarious jokes. \nNext to great company\
  \ I\u2019m receiving a bunch of useful tips for Bali as well because Jack spent\
  \ most of his vacations there and knows the ins and outs of the place just as well\
  \ as a local. I feel really fortunate about having someone so bright on my side,\
  \ who is willing to share useful insights both about Bali and Australia.\nA journey\
  \ that I expected to be dull and sad turned out to be one of the most enjoyable\
  \ ones I ever experienced and all because of the greatness of a person that I may\
  \ never see in my life again. My sadness about leaving Sydney disappeared for that\
  \ while thanks to this stranger I met at the right time in the right place. Amazing\
  \ things happen when we expect the least."
