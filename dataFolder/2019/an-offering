Text: "Love.\n\nLearn. \n\nWork.\n\nThese three values are what the people of Lake\
  \ Titicaca align their lives with.\nLake Titicaca.\n\nThe world\u2019s highest navigable\
  \ body of water.\n\nFloating islands made from read.\n\nThe divide between the old\
  \ world and the new has never been so apparent.\n\nA woman of 66 years of age. Escaped\
  \ her first arranged marriage, only to be tricked into another upon her return home\
  \ three years later. \n\nShe\u2019s very lucky, she tells us. Her husband is a kind\
  \ and good man. \n\nFive children. Three boys and two girls. Another apparent divide\
  \ between the old and the new. \n\nHer daughters. Married when they were in high\
  \ school. Now living the same life on the Lake as their own mother.\n\nHer son\u2019\
  s. Their desire to venture to the neighboring city of Puno in order to study has\
  \ resulted in them abandoning their traditional upbringing to live a modernised\
  \ version. \n\nHer eldest 38. Her youngest 18. \n\nShe continues to work to provide\
  \ monetary assistance for her studying children. \n\nHer wise words of wisdom to\
  \ me: \L\u2018Have no more than two children!\u2019\n\nIt was heartening to see\
  \ a mother and father dedicated to offering their children the best lives they could\
  \ possibly provide.  Here.  On the other side of the world. In a country where opportunity\
  \ isn\u2019t readily available. \n\nA reflection of my own parents. \n\nAs we departed,\
  \ we were gifted small bouquets in thanks. Our guide, Ellie, encouraged us to make\
  \ a wish, and provide an offering to Copacati, Goddess of the Lake.\n\nAs we visit\
  \ the island Ellie was born on, he reflects on his childhood. \n\nHe and his brother\
  \ offered the same opportunities in life.\n\nHim. Now living a modern life in Puno.\
  \ Never married. Continuing his studies. \nHis brother. Moved back to the island.\
  \ Now married, with a son. Dedicated to traditional customs. \n\nI reflect on my\
  \ own childhood. \n\nWe are continually encouraged to live a life of meaning and\
  \ purpose. \n\nCaught up in the idealism that we have the capacity to create change\
  \ in the world. \n\nAfter so many years attempting to impact positive change on\
  \ a government level, and continuing to confront red tape, I very recently gave\
  \ up. However, realisation has finally hit.\n\nWe do have the capacity to create\
  \ change in the world.\n\nOur little segment of the world. \n\nBe the best you can\
  \ be. \n\nDo what makes you feel alive. \n\nSurround yourself with people who will\
  \ challenge and respect you. \n\nYou can create a segment of the world rich with\
  \ love and respect.\n\nWe certainly do have the power to make a difference. However\
  \ small it may be, it could mean the world to one person. \n\nAs we made our way\
  \ back to the mainland, I headed to the stern of our boat to make my wish and offering\
  \ to Copacati.\n\nOfferings to the Gods are integral to everyday life in traditional\
  \ South America. Despite my own beliefs, I continue to keep my mind and heart open\
  \ throughout my travels.\n\nRespect.\n\nIt\u2019s the most important lesson I\u2019\
  ve learned.\n\nAs I throw my bouquet into the ocean, my desires for the next 12\
  \ months are forefront of my mind.\n\nMy wish?\n\nTo have the fortitude to work\
  \ towards my desires, to continue to learn no matter the situation, and the commitment\
  \ to do it all with the love and respect I continue to find in small segments of\
  \ our vast world."
