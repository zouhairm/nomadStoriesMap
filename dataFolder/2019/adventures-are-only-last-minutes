Text: "People often tell you that when you plan a trip at the last minute, you end\
  \ up spending more and I openly disagree with this. Just like everything in the\
  \ universe, travelers are also not monolithic. And this generalization about traveling\
  \ is one of the biggest misconceptions that you spend more on impromptu travels.\
  \ Because I believe that if you are a budgeted traveler then you already know all\
  \ the hacks and you know how to save money. \n\nLike all my other travels, this\
  \ one trip I took to explore Skardu, a valley at the elevation of 2,500 meters in\
  \ Karakoram mountain ranges, happened to be too impromptu and last minute and all\
  \ the little planning I did went in waste as the journey began. So there are only\
  \ two ways to access the valley, either by air or by road. There is only one flight\
  \ per day from Islamabad, the capital of Pakistan and that too often gets cancelled\
  \ because of weather or sometimes for diplomatic reasons. In that case, you\u2019\
  re either offered to take the next available flight which not necessarily can happen\
  \ the next day, so in that case it is preferred to rent a car and hit the road.\
  \ And for people like me who are coming from extreme south of the country, Karachi,\
  \ also need to reach by air (2 hours), train (21 hours) or road (24 hours via bus)\
  \ need more time to get there. Yet, I only planned a 5 day trip, 2 days in prior\
  \ and began the journey with a rough itinerary in mind. \n\nUpon reaching Islamabad,\
  \ I found out that the flight to Skardu has been cancelled and we can take the next\
  \ flight, next day but the chances of getting a seat is 50-50 so I and the friend\
  \ with whom I was traveling decided to rent a car and hit the road without wasting\
  \ time. Since we were only two girls, we were a little nervous about the road safety\
  \ and security but without putting much thought we started the journey at 11:30\
  \ am from Islamabad. On the way, we have been told that Babusar Top closes at 08:00\
  \ pm and then opens at 04:00 am the next day. We thought that this might only happen\
  \ during snowfall season or in the days when there is some political or social unrest.\
  \ We took a 30 minute break in Abbottabad and started the journey again. As soon\
  \ as we crossed Shogran, the sun was setting and mobile signals were gone; with\
  \ that the map stopped updating and I realized the importance of off-line maps.\
  \ Soon we also realized that we won\u2019t be able to make it to the Babusar top\
  \ and we might have to spend the night somewhere.\n\nHowever, since we didn\u2019\
  t have any Plan B or discussed about where we are going to stay the night in case\
  \ of Babusar Top closure, we were in less or none position to negotiate. However,\
  \ upon reach that last spot, we noticed that it was a small market area which had\
  \ hotels to provide the lodging to heavy vehicle drivers and is not suitable for\
  \ ladies. The town was so remote that it did not even have mobile boosters, because\
  \ of which we were completely cut off from everything. As the night was getting\
  \ darker, it was getting colder and colder. We rented out a room and sent our driver\
  \ to sleep in it and we two girls spent the night awake in the car while the entire\
  \ town including dogs was sleeping. Occasional wolf howl kept us company throughout\
  \ the night. At dot 5:00 am in the morning, we started the journey again and while\
  \ enjoying the scenic Karakoram-Highway which is an engineering marvel on its own,\
  \ we finally reached Skardu at 3:30pm. In that 27 hour journey, I didn\u2019t sleep\
  \ at all, so I though upon reaching the hotel in Skardu, I might crash and sleep.\
  \ But at the mesmerizing sight of the Mighty River Indus, flowing in the arms of\
  \ the humongous Karakoram mountains, I forgotten my sleep and geared to explore\
  \ all that I could."
