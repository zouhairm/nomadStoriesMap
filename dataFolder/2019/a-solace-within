Text: "Life was encircling between making sense to stop making sense. To top it off,\
  \ the news of visiting our cultural land of India from my parent's, was the last\
  \ thing to spark off my excitement. After a taxing journey from our cousin's wedding,\
  \ we decided to spend the night at Vadodara and head to Gir National Park at Junagadh,\
  \ Gujarat, the next morning.\n\nMy mother, a woman of deep faith in the mystical\
  \ powers of the universe talks about gods as if she is in a working partnership\
  \ with him. Assuage, yet restless to unravel something unforgettable out of this\
  \ seemingly, far from stimulating, place. One of the locals sporadically coined\
  \ the words, \u201CSomnath Temple\u201D into my mother\u2019s ears which she instantly\
  \ jumped like a kid for a wonderland. \n\nAfter spotting the regal lions at the\
  \ Gir National Park we decided to head towards Somnath. It is situated on the seashore\
  \ of Prabhasa Patan at Saurashtra 70 km from Junagadh. Intrigued by the stories\
  \ in the air, we decided to find the folklore of the temple before visiting it.\
  \ A local preacher came to our rescue, \u201CSomnath is the first of the 12 Jyotirlinga\
  \ (pillars of light) shrines of Lord Shiva. Moon God (Soma) is believed to be cursed\
  \ for favoring one of his wives. He prayed earnestly to Lord Shiva at the exact\
  \ site of the temple. Lord Shiva appeared before the Moon God's penance and freed\
  \ him from the curse. Moon regained his brightness and Somnath became the sacred\
  \ shrine from there on for the devotees of Lord Shiva. He passionately further exclaimed\
  \ that the mythology is not just rooted with Lord Shiva but also with Lord Krishna\
  \ who is believed to have left his human incarnation here. Despite the temple being\
  \ invaded many times, millennium after millennium, each time it rose like a phoenix\
  \ from the fire. Symbolizing the power of reconstruction is always greater than\
  \ the power of destruction.\u201D\n\nThe stories were feeding me the knowledge to\
  \ unearth our cultural values. This expedition lead me not just to unleash the history\
  \ and architecture of the place but drew a superfluous feeling which was unfathomable.\
  \ I could physically feel my body shifting gears as I walked into the impressive\
  \ built towards the sanctum inhaling the gentle breezes of the Arabian. As we came\
  \ close by, our bodies were uplifted at the mere sight of the plush intricate carvings\
  \ coupled with the enchanting hymns, fragrances of the sandalwood and the enthralling\
  \ sound of the Arabian currents.\n\nWe stood there fixated, till my mother, the\
  \ hero of the family, asked us to follow her to complete the entire parikrama (circle)\
  \ of the sanctum. On completion of the parikrama, the high priest applied the sandalwood\
  \ paste with a marigold flower on our foreheads which instantly rang a bell within,\
  \ a knock maybe to cast off our transient selves. There was some magic in the air\
  \ which we were unable to discern with our naked eyes and shallow wisdom. Soon,\
  \ the dusk approached and so was the time for the evening chants by the priests.\n\
  \nTo my utter amazement the first prayer was offered to the Arabian Sea than to\
  \ Lord Shiva with the smashing of the drums and opening of the gigantic door, at\
  \ the perfect hour when the sunlight was bleeding slowly at the horizon. We were\
  \ facing directly to the Arabian Sea which was bountiful in its expanse. In that\
  \ very moment, I felt so powerful just like the raging waves of the Arabian. The\
  \ vigor within me was resonating with the swirling Arabian currents. It was after\
  \ a long time when nothing else mattered more than just to be in that very moment.\
  \ \n\nJust as rare as a sunflower in the desert, that was the rarity to witness\
  \ the serenity on our faces. Our eyes were gleaming as lustrous as the morning 8\
  \ am Sun. The solace we found within was irresistible. Everything felt transcendental.\
  \ I revived my lost connection with the law. As nothing changed in my life except\
  \ this: the desire of fame, fear, and hopelessness died; while courage, compassion\
  \ and hope were born. I was the same mirror, yet a little less tarnished."
