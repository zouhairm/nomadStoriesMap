Text: "It was something I had always wanted to do, but when it actually happened,\
  \ it was in unexpected and extraordinary ways. Starting from the 'city of dreams',\
  \ Mumbai, my journey went through the South, east, middle, a part of North and the\
  \ west India. My travelling took me to meet new and different people, all leading\
  \ completely different and enthralling lives, from different cultures, speaking\
  \ different languages, eating different types of foods, but all living for a purpose.\
  \ It was interesting to know their stories and discover their motivations in life.\n\
  What further multiplied the joy and learning of my journey was relying upon local\
  \ transportation and trying local staple foods.\nOf course while I met the best\
  \ of people throughout my journey, I also realised how humanity is the value that\
  \ ultimately connects everyone at their hearts. People like to be listened to, people\
  \ like to listen to you, people like to care and be cared, they understand and want\
  \ to be understood, all that matters is how open you are to mend your ways, open\
  \ to new perspectives and ready to get the real education, which is people and places.\n\
  No matter where my life leads me now, this journey I went through, the people I\
  \ met, that indispensable experience, those adversities that hid pleasure I now\
  \ realise, all that is now an inseparable part of me, a part of Ghazal \u2764\uFE0F\
  ...\nAnd I know this story will continue forever, regardless of the end of that\
  \ specific journey through India.\nI wish to travel and explore the whole world\
  \ with the same open heart and mind and justify the title of my story, An International\
  \ Citizen!\nInfact the title is so because I feel that the story is still being\
  \ continued, that I am still living it. I write a travel blog, where I like sharing\
  \ my travel experiences, fernbays, which is inspired from the word 'Fernweh', that\
  \ means an urge to travel more than wanderlust.\nI sincerely look forward to being\
  \ selected for this exploring and writing journey through Portugal, and continue\
  \ writing my story.\nThanks 'worldnomads' for this amazing opportunity \u2764\uFE0F"
