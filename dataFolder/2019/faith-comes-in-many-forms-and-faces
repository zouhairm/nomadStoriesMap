Text: "Despite the fact that I grew up in an Indian Hindu family and believed in the\
  \ course of karma (actions), I had never been so emotionally struck with the charm\
  \ of Kumbh Mela, a mass Hindu pilgrimage which takes place in the city of Prayagraj\
  \ (formerly Allahabad) and three other cities of India, at a rotation of three years.\
  \ The one that happens after 12 years is called MahaKumbh (biggest) and after six\
  \ years is called ArdhKumbh (half). Each Kumbh is grand in itself.\n\nAccording\
  \ to my grandmother, no human being should miss a holy dip during Kumbh. I would\
  \ often ask her, what is the fun of taking a dip in the freezing hours, when these\
  \ rivers are not even clean and pure. She would reply with conviction \u201CPeople\
  \ do it for their soul cleansing, for scouring sins. The rivers are extremely powerful\
  \ and pure. They never become dirty.\u201D I would look at my mother in disbelief\
  \ but these were some of the rare occasions when my mother would nod in agreement\
  \ with my Granny. \n\nThis year when I questioned my granny once again, my mother\
  \ poured her heart out, \u201CThere is something miraculous about faith and it makes\
  \ you do everything. You just have to put your heart to it. Kumbh is not an event\
  \ but a celebration of religion, culture and most importantly, faith.\u201D My father\
  \ read the unconvinced frown on my face and insisted \u201CYou must go there once,\
  \ to see and experience the magnanimity of the largest Hindu congregation\u201D\
  . \n\nEveryone talked about crores of devotees taking a holy dip, the procession\
  \ of the Nagas (the people who have abandoned worldly pleasures) in their real elements\
  \ and the significance of taking dip at the meeting point of the three rivers but\
  \ this was not all. I was seeking my own answers and some more questions. To pacify\
  \ my urge, it was important to travel to Prayagraj from New Delhi. And as they say,\
  \ where there is a will, there is a way. A writing opportunity came my way and I\
  \ experienced Kumbh on one most important royal bathing days. It was not just a\
  \ special day of Mauni Amavasya, but also very auspicious as per the Hindu calendar.\
  \ \n\nAnyone who has been to Kumbh in Prayagraj knows that the moment you sight\
  \ a pontoon bridge (floating bridge), you know that you are headed right. Kumbh\
  \ 2019 was spread over an area of 3200 hectare (around 8000 acres) and to cater\
  \ to the millions that had come to live-by, experience and thrive by the pilgrimage,\
  \ there was not just one floating bridge but twenty two of them. Almost 1 lakh e-toilets\
  \ were facilitated. Temporary tent camps had been setup. I couldn\u2019t stop myself\
  \ from getting overwhelmed. This was the biggest human gathering that I had seen.\
  \ It was amazing to see how humans were helping each other to realize their faith.\
  \ Millions of people had come from all over India and even abroad to take a bath.\
  \ Really? Even the thought of it left me perplexed. \n\nAnd finally, on the day\
  \ of Mauni Amavasyua, it was not just the throng of people that took me by surprise\
  \ but their enthusiasm at the wee hours of the day.  At the time of packing my bags,\
  \ the thought of taking a dip dint even occur to me but when I reached at the Sangam\
  \ (meeting point of three rivers), I was pulled in the enigma and events.  The ambiance\
  \ reverberated with prayer, chanting, saints, holy dip, devotion, people and pilgrimage.\
  \ I literally jumped in without a thought. I did it to respect the faith of my granny\
  \ and my parents. At one point, I also felt I must take a dip because if lakhs around\
  \ me were doing that, there was something right about it. I wanted to do it. \n\n\
  While the good people say that bathing in Ganga during the time of Kumbh washes\
  \ away your sins, I actually felt lighter. I felt like a different person. I felt\
  \ more convinced. I felt I had seen  faith in its many forms and faces. I had found\
  \ my answers."
