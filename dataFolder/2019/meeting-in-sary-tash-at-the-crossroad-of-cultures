Text: "Are you married? My smile hadn\u2019t been enough, or maybe it had been too\
  \ much. No-one here on the elevated plateau of the Alay valley seemed to be smiling,\
  \ not the man with two thumbs on one hand, nor the dark-eyed, dark-browed children\
  \ outside the boz\xF6.\n\n\u2018Do you have any children?...how old are you?\n\n\
  I spluttered and hesitated. I looked down at my wrinkled hands baked by the Taklamakan,\
  \ its sands from two weeks before encrusted under my nails and cuticles. \n\nNext\
  \ to me, the emptiness of the car seat where her husband had been sitting and driving\
  \ only moments before and blasting post-soviet synth pop from the crackling stereo,\
  \ seemed to grow to a gaping crevasse, impossible to bridge.\n\nEvery time I said\
  \ no I felt as though I\u2019d failed somehow, another cross on her imaginary score\
  \ card. It grated, it was at odds to my version of my journey. A woman travelling\
  \ alone in the mountains, I was empowered\u2026wasn\u2019t I?\n\nBut\u2026but I\
  \ have a degree in History from London, I don\u2019t want a husband, I sure don\u2019\
  t fucking want children and\u2026I recoiled catching myself grappling for the privileged\
  \ currency of my western world to protest her interrogation.\n\nHowever, out here\
  \ 3170 metres above sea level my thoughts withered before they ever reached my lips.\
  \ It wasn\u2019t just the dizzying altitude that was confusing but also the crashing\
  \ realisation that I\u2019d reached the physical boundaries of cultural understanding.\
  \ My ideas of being a woman, or being successful were shaped by city life in a world\
  \ of glass skylines and 4G. They couldn\u2019t hold out against the pungent, yeasty\
  \ kumis or the smell of damp, felted boz\xF6. They shrank in the hugeness of the\
  \ steppe, and became shapeless in shadow of the ominous black, snow-capped Kurumdy\
  \ mountain range.\n\n\u2018I have five children\u2026where are you going?\u2019\n\
  \nI tried to make peace. Your English is really good, I told her and it wasn\u2019\
  t a lie. Widespread corruption in Kyrgyzstan following it\u2019s forced independence\
  \ from the Soviet Union had resulted in a complex system of unofficial bribes and\
  \ payments in schools and low levels of education.\nJust over the border in China,\
  \ in an economy which dwarves Kyrgystan\u2019s and which spends much more money\
  \ on education and English is not widely spoken at all. Although this has much more\
  \ to do with a sense of national pride than GDP.\n\nRegardless, no-one had informed\
  \ my interlocutor because she spoke with a fluency which easily conveyed her overwhelming\
  \ disapproval.\n\n \u2018I am the English teacher here and where are you going?\u2019\
  \ she answered, no time for my desperate, patronising attempt at peace. Overcome\
  \ with my own inadequacy, I told her I had a boyfriend who was joining me in Bishkek.\
  \ I looked down at my dusty trainers. We both knew I was lying.\n\nHer husband came\
  \ out of the house, a small, whitewashed single room shack balanced above the dark\
  \ green grass of the valley. He was followed by several ragged, silent children\
  \ in bare feet.\n\n He clutched a white, plastic bag with his dinner and he was\
  \ smiling, because he was taking six foreigners to Osh and that meant money. 2000\u0441\
  \u043E\u043C for the six hour drive, the equivalent of \xA321 pounds.\n\n \u2018\
  My husband is a good man\u2019 she told me, leaving me to squirm in her parting\
  \ statement\u2019s ambiguity as her husband climbed into the drivers seat next to\
  \ me.\n\nHe reversed the car away from the white shack with a corrugated roof through\
  \ the other white shacks that make up Sary-Tash; the village marks the meeting point\
  \ of the roads flowing down from the Pamir and Tian Shan mountains, the geographical\
  \ borders of Tajikistan and China.\n\nI turned around to snatch one last look at\
  \ this woman who refused to play traveler with me. A red headscarf wrapped around\
  \ her proud, round face and surrounded by brooding, dirty, serious children outside\
  \ her small hut.\n\nIn that moment, against the ancient mountains and plains that\
  \ had stood, unchanging, through mongol warriors and silk road merchants and nomads\
  \ and now restless western travelers, she might just have been an incarnation of\
  \ Manas himself."
