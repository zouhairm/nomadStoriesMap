Text: "Following the plan on my concept of life, After finishing my studies, I decided\
  \ to leave my city in the Northeast of Brazil and move to Rio de Janeiro to work\
  \ as a journalist and actor. For two years, working as a reporter and living in\
  \ touch with people's suffering, I began to be interested in the causes of this\
  \ suffering, which increased, when I realized that, I was suffering from other circumstances,\
  \ then it wasn't just a question of social condition. Then, after repeated crises\
  \ of consciousness and unsuccessful in psychological sessions, I realized that I\
  \ could not manage my life. Next day on theater, we had for the first time, s I\
  \ decide to start doing meditation lessons for the first time, so I understood it\
  \ as a signal.\n\nAfter a year and a half of practice my life changed completely:\
  \ now I was vegetarian,  more compassionate and calm, a deep self work began and\
  \ I was getting myself known in the way that I could never imagine. It was time\
  \ to go beyond, to discover the spiritual meaning of life. Everything was losing\
  \ the meaning, I was more interested in studying myself and know about: Love, Humanity\
  \ and God. So I left everything that holds me In Rio, Job, bills and relationships.\n\
  In my parents' house, I didn't know exactly where I was going, and since I didn't\
  \ have much money, things got more exciting. So I started to do completely different\
  \ that time, wait for the right moment and signs. Finally, when I already had my\
  \ destiny and goals, I left. The goal was to participate in a meditation retreat,\
  \ also in the Northeast of Brazil and then go to a tourist and spiritual point called\
  \ Chapada Diamantina, total kilometres: 2392km. To make this trip more enjoyable\
  \ and easy, I decided to do volunteer work at the hostels of the most important\
  \ cities that I found along the way. It will also be a way to have more time getting\
  \ to know people and doing my meditations often.\n\nAt first, I felt scary for throwing\
  \ my self into the unknown, but it was too late for regrets. Following the plan,\
  \ I started very well:paradise cities, that made me feel  after fifteen days, how\
  \ life turns mild but intense  in the same way. Two hippies inspire me to be more\
  \ courageous, faithful and let the heart act as a compass in the roads. That experience\
  \ was intense because, I felt the compassion and the contempt from the people that\
  \ I met, So I learnt: The relationship with the others depends on the relationship\
  \ with yourself.\n\"Everything is connected\" you attract what you transmit \"This\
  \ became true and proves in that trip. Despite the difficulties,like sleep in the\
  \ gas stations, beaches and squares, I was thankful to found so much help always\
  \ found nice people to help. Then, I was already in Theo's car on the way to retreat.\
  \ Vipassana was incredible, I felt strong after getting so far. The opportunity\
  \ to stay 10 days in total silence doing meditation meditating,  made find peace\
  \ between me and myself, It was really difficult, but I did it!\n\n In Chapada Diamantina.\
  \  I had spiritual experiences with alternative societies, what made understand\
  \  how human are nothing without  spirit, and goes beyond concepts about religion\
  \ and belief . I studied with them, received some treatments that opened my mind.\
  \ \nSt. Francis of Assisi, a famous saint of the Catholic Church, left for us the\
  \ term \"Death in Life\".  It is  a expression, that means a revolutionary process\
  \ that you need to take to change your life, to fulfill your dreams that, for many\
  \ reasons, you are not able to do.  My leap into the unknown is not over yet, I\
  \ still traveling and helping everyone as best I can,  the Leap became a path. Today,\
  \ I  work as Holistic Therapist, developing the meditation, Yoga and other techniques,\
  \ I am so  grateful for the force that guided me for that adventure, yes[...]! I\
  \ think that I'm beginning to  understand what means God."
