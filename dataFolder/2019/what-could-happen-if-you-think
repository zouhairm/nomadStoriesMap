Text: "With less than 700 hundred words, this is the introduction of an unforgettable\
  \ trip to the unknown at the other side of the world.\n\nHave you ever tried just\
  \ to try? They say you can get to Rome just by asking, so I want to see if it also\
  \ applies when you just try. \n\nWhenever an opportunity came so easily, when you\
  \ don\u2019t even have to ask, it just came because of luck. However you wanna call\
  \ it: fate, destiny, coincidence or even accident. But here is the indescribable\
  \ thing, because I want your body to start making the opposite it always do. Imagine.\n\
  \nUsually, our brain catches what we see through our eyes, giving sense to this\
  \ images so we can understand them. When we imagine it\u2019s just the opposite.\
  \ Our brain recreates images and send them to our occipital lobes to see what we\
  \ imagine. \n\nNow that you have understand how it works, imagine that thing you\
  \ have always wanted. Maybe is that Ferrari you saw driving at high speed on the\
  \ highway the other day. Maybe is get to know that beautiful woman you always  say\
  \ \u201CHi\u201D, but every time you wanna talk to her you get kinda stupid and\
  \ can\u2019t really get to know her... No matter what you want, just imagine it\
  \ starts happening. Can you create those images? And can you feel it?\n\nNow it\u2019\
  s time for me to explain you how I felt that time I imagine a trip to Portugal,\
  \ and I got it, just by wanted it so much, just by creating images on my brain.\n\
  \nThis is the story of what could happen if you just think."
