Text: "On the days that it didn\u2019t rain, the sun came through the window and hit\
  \ my face like a brick. The singing birds at my window made for a pleasant alarm\
  \ clock, over the barking dogs in the distance. My roommate, Sangay, whose name\
  \ I mispronounced for the first two weeks, was always awake before me. With my eyes\
  \ still closed, I would hear her plastic flip-flops shuffling on the concrete floor,\
  \ followed by the sudden squeak of her bed as she sat down on its edge to pray.\
  \ Between smelling the incense and feeling the cool Himalayan breeze roll in, I\
  \ would eventually emerge from the depths of my covers and start my day. Together,\
  \ Sangay and I would make coffee and talk about Buddhism: this simple routine was\
  \ one of my favorite parts of the day. After, we would make breakfast together,\
  \ usually fried rice with eggs. On the days that Sangay and I didn\u2019t have class,\
  \ we would spend a few hours reading in a cubby in her window, which we would fill\
  \ with pillows and blankets. Both of us fit perfectly in there, and we had a beautiful\
  \ view of the mountains from this spot. For lunch, I would meet with my Canadian\
  \ friends, and we would catch each other up on our adventures. The campus was gender\
  \ segregated, and we all lived somewhat far apart from one another, so this was\
  \ an important part of the day for us. At suppertime, Sangay and I would prepare\
  \ a meal around 6 or 7, but sometimes the reality of 'Bhutan Stretchable Time' would\
  \ have us making dinner somewhere around midnight. Sangay liked to cook just as\
  \ much as I like to eat, so things worked out really well for us. She taught me\
  \ how to make \u2018momos\u2019 (cheese filled dumplings), and \u2018Ema Datshi\u2019\
  \ (chilies cooked in cheese) and many other dishes she enjoys making. In the evenings,\
  \ I would meet with my Canadian friend Alison, and we would reflect on our day.\
  \ Alison was my human journal. I told her everything, and she would listen without\
  \ judgment. Maybe she did judge me at times, but our conversations were therapeutic\
  \ nonetheless. Afterward, we would usually go for an evening walk with our roommates\
  \ to the market and buy some produce for the following days. We didn't have the\
  \ luxury of a refrigerator or other means of preserving food, so grocery shopping\
  \ was an everyday pursuit. Sangay and I would end the day working on our assignments\
  \ in bed, which often ended up in soul-searching conversations about our respective\
  \ views on life until we fell asleep. Sangay and I were similar enough to relate\
  \ to each other but different enough to surprise each other. Like myself, she found\
  \ comfort in a hot cup of tea, dreaded getting up for any class that started before\
  \ 8:00 am and secretly loved Justin Bieber. Although we shared much in common, we\
  \ had our differences too. One day, I told Sangay that I was going on a walk by\
  \ myself and she looked shocked. Sangay insisted that she join me, and asked me\
  \ if I was depressed. Confused, I asked my Canadian friends if they experienced\
  \ any cross-cultural misunderstandings. I learned that I might as well have told\
  \ Sangay I was going to take 20 shots of tequila at a bar by myself that afternoon.\
  \ In a collectivist society, doing things alone seriously deviates from the norm.\
  \ Although stark differences between Sangay and I presented themselves often, the\
  \ humanity we shared was always quick to follow. From procrastinating on our assignments\
  \ and sneaking out of our dorm to go get drunk in a field, it became clear to me\
  \ that Sangay and I were just two 21-year-old girls getting through university,\
  \ hoping that we would one day make our parents proud. My day to day life in Bhutan\
  \ taught me that humans, no matter what part of the world they are from, are more\
  \ similar than they are different. I try to keep this in mind when I travel because\
  \ I would otherwise miss out on connecting with locals like Sangay, who has become\
  \ one of my best friendships, and life lessons."
