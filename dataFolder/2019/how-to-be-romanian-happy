Text: "When I was 19 years old, I decided to visit Romania with a kind, older group\
  \ of southern evangelicals. Their goal was to bring medical supplies and cheer and\
  \ their message of hope to the Romanians. I remember thinking I knew what to expect\
  \ when I visited Romania. I couldn\u2019t have been more wrong. Not only was it\
  \ better and worse in someways that I could have imagined, but the Romanian people\
  \ stuck fast in my heart. I dreamed of hem for months after.\n My role on the trip\
  \ was interpretive dancer. Because of the language barrier I learned that I could\
  \ sign with my hands and move my body to music and somehow everyone in the room\
  \ still understood. Sometimes they cried with me as I danced.  I danced for villagers,\
  \ small churches, schools, orphaned children, prisoners in high security all men\u2019\
  s prisons, and children crippled in daycare nursing homes.\n I\u2019ll never forget\
  \ the Romanian heart. It beats warm and hopeful despite everything they have been\
  \ through. The difference between most Americans and Romanians is that despite many\
  \ of them being in what we consider abject poverty, they are much happier than we\
  \ are as what they consider \u201Crich\u201D. They\u2019ve figured out a secret\
  \ to life that I\u2019m still trying to work out. Someday I\u2019ll go back (as\
  \ I promised many of them I would) and find out how to be Romanian happy."
