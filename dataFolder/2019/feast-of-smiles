Text: "Bodies robed in loose clothing littered the square surrounding the bar, \u2018\
  Zoe in Yellow\u2019. In a few hours all hell would break loose and the area would\
  \ be bombarded with hundreds of partying backpackers. To the north of \u2018Zoe\u2019\
  s,\u2019, sitting inside a small bar with no name and evading the crowds, I sipped\
  \ a warming bottle of Singha with only the bartender for company.\n\nDusk was approaching\
  \ and the city was desperately clinging to the last rays of fading light, relishing\
  \ in the solace before inevitably succumbing to the night. Waiting for the customers\
  \ in the Indian restaurant across the street to vacate I welcomed the approaching\
  \ cool darkness. Feeling tired and homesick, eating amongst a busy group of people\
  \ had me despise exactly what the city had to offer: the people.\n\nI could have\
  \ easily walked off and found one of the other hundreds if not thousands of other\
  \ food vendors and restaurants in Chiang Mai, but my mood was stubborn. Finishing\
  \ my drink, the bartender, a gentleman of about thirty \u2013 sporting the best\
  \ moustache I had ever seen \u2013 promptly brought me another beer and smiled a\
  \ heart-warming grin. This smile did not stop at face value as many do, but reached\
  \ deep into my soul, not mimicking joy, but creating it. Surprised, and now intrigued,\
  \ I beamed back.\n\nAs an elderly woman walked into the bar carrying an array of\
  \ containers, the gentleman started moving furniture. He pulled small round tables\
  \ from every corner of the bar, joining four of them in the middle and covering\
  \ them in a floral cloth, creating a dinner setting.\n\nAs the guests who filled\
  \ the tables at the Indian restaurant were yet to disperse I took another pull from\
  \ my beer and took in my surroundings; watching the vast variety of people wandering\
  \ about. Suddenly, mid swig, I was startled by my bartender tapping me on the shoulder.\
  \ I smiled, nervous and confused. Following his finger towards the recently set\
  \ table now surrounded by five others, he motioned for me to join. \n\n\u201CEat\
  \ with us,\u201D he requested. Shocked, I tried to politely decline, waving my hand\
  \ as if waving away a fly, my stubborn heart set on Indian food. Moments passed\
  \ as everyone around the table stared, there were no smiles for those few seconds\
  \ and I selfishly realised the respect I was being shown. \n\nAccepting the invitation\
  \ and occupying one of the two vacant chairs at the table I was greeted with welcoming\
  \ grins and a smorgasbord of food. A plethora of fried meats and vegetables of numerous\
  \ varieties encircled the overflowing rice pot in the centre of the table. \n\n\
  The hungering smell was too much and the feasting promptly begun. Food flowed freely\
  \ amongst a twitching sea of rapidly moving bamboo chopsticks. More than once a\
  \ random pair of briskly moving utensils placed a portion of cuisine onto my plate\
  \ before disappearing amongst the chaos. Thai language filled the air, the crisp\
  \ sounds of words intrigued my ears and my taste buds cherished every bite.\n\n\
  We all ate hungrily until all that remained was a smattering of fish bones and the\
  \ odd grain of rice.  Thai was the language of the meal, however, the smiling was\
  \ consistent and it needed no translation. I felt extremely welcome. \n\nAs the\
  \ food disappeared, my new found family quickly dispersed as I insisted on doing\
  \ the washing up in the small sink at the back of the bar. I no longer felt homesick,\
  \ but gratitude and appreciation for such an overwhelmingly warm and welcoming gesture.\
  \ This chance encounter of human connection over a meal would be an experience that\
  \ I would never forget.\n\nFinishing the washing up I went to leave, noticing the\
  \ crowd in the square now building with the volume of the music. The bartender approached\
  \ me and grabbing my hand he thanked me for coming; his sincerity written in his\
  \ smile. Grinning from ear to ear I attempted to convey my gratitude, fearing words\
  \ and smiles alone were not enough. As I finally left the bar he waved after me,\
  \ until I was eventually consumed by the crowd of bodies and once again; lost to\
  \ the city."
