Text: "\u201COnce in Naples\u201D is a travel story from a life experience. It is\
  \ a soul deposit and it is more like a travel diary of events and emotions.\n\t\
  Five young people of six European countries are gathering together in a little town\
  \ nearby Naples. Erasmus programme is the reason why they are started not only thinking\
  \ about sustainability and all kind of its implementation, but also exploring themselves\
  \ and the others.  \n\tAt the foot of Vesuvius they will discover their will and\
  \ they will share their dreams. In view of the open sea, they will feel the true\
  \ freedom and the ruins of Pompeii will make them reflect on the past. Between Salerno\
  \ and Positano they will share the same smile and in the narrow streets of Naples\
  \ they will fall in love with... life.\n\tBut there are still remaining 30 atoms.\
  \ How can they be released from any trace of suspicion and cautiousness to make\
  \ these 14 days have meaning that will last for a lifetime?\n\tWell, it is the code\
  \ \u201CBora- bora\u201D that is ringing the bell inside their minds and call them\
  \ to speak the same language. To speak the truth which comes from their inside and\
  \ it burns them, like lava from Vesuvius in the past.\n\tIt is Fall and it is in\
  \ Naples, where everything began to make sense. Because it is a myth to believe\
  \ that adulthood occurs once in human life. We reborn ourselves by our ashes, like\
  \ Phoenix. \n\t30 Phoenixs once in Naples are dreaming the future while the present\
  \ is showing them the road, however, the labels are refers of the past."
