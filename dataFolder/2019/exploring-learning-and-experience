Text: "Life is full of unexpected surprises and challenges. Twenty-five-year-old Bhargavi,\
  \ who had completed post graduation in Law from National Law School of India University,\
  \ Bengaluru joined Chakrapani Associates, a Law Firm in Mumbai, as a junior. Observing\
  \ her excellent knowledge, she was asked to assist the team of lawyers, who were\
  \ dealing with the highly sensitive murder case. Bhargavi was asked to proceed to\
  \ Chennai in connection with the case. \n\nWhile returning from Chennai, she had\
  \ an unexpected surprise. \n\nThe Chennai-Mumbai Express train was moving at a high\
  \ speed. In the first class air condition compartment, there were only a few passengers,\
  \ mainly a marriage party. It was midnight. The train was just five kilometres away\
  \ from Gulbarga. Bhargavi, a lone young woman passenger, was waking up. She was\
  \ reading a magazine. One young man was waking up in the marriage party. Suddenly\
  \ two persons with their faces covered,  entered the bogie. One of them went straight\
  \ to Bhargavi. These two guys' aim was to attack the marriage party. But one of\
  \ them changed the original plan. It was not a mistaken identity but he did it purposely.\
  \ One person had a big moustache, long grey hair wearing blue half shirt and lungi.\
  \ Another person was clean shaved, wearing white full shirt and trouser. They appeared\
  \ to be robbers in the train. She became nervous and her body was trembling for\
  \ a moment. Bhargavi closed her eyes and prayed to God.  \n\nThe blue shirt man\
  \ asked, \u201CMadam, hand over your bag to me immediately. I warn you not to protest\
  \ or alert the other passengers.\u201D\n\nShe was in the fear psychosis for a few\
  \ seconds due to the sudden development. Probably, one of the guys had information\
  \ on precious things in her bag. Who gave them the information? She was in dilemma,\
  \ whether to act boldly or handover the bag to save her life. She was not a coward.\
  \ She was bold since her college days. She won a number of bravery awards during\
  \ her college days.\n\n\n \n\u201CWho are you? Who told you that I am having treasure\
  \ in the bag? If you insist me to hand over the bag, I will call the police and\
  \ alert all the co-passengers. I warn you to get lost from here,\u201D said the\
  \ young lady.\n\nIf the gold ornaments were not in her bag, then what was kept in\
  \ the bag? Why one of the guys went straight to Bhargavi instead of going to a marriage\
  \ party?\n\n\u201CYou may be bold. I don't bother your boldness. I want your bag.\
  \  If you protest like this, I will have to take out my revolver and shoot you at\
  \ the point blank,\u201D said the blue shirt man.\n\nThe other white shirt man was\
  \ silent and watching the situation. On seeing her pitiable condition, he thought\
  \ to help her. God gave him good sense.\n\nThe man in white shirt said, \u201CMy\
  \ dear friend, you can take her bag. Please do not harm her. You are forgetting\
  \ our original plan to attack the marriage party. Why did you change the plan? I\
  \ caution you not to attack a lonely woman. I know our job is to steal the valuables\
  \ either by force or by theft. In the case of a lonely innocent woman, we have to\
  \ show sympathy and follow ethics. Who knows what is stored in her bag? Snatching\
  \ a bag from her is not a problem. Let us move towards the marriage party and force\
  \ them to part with the treasure at a gunpoint. \n\n \u201CWe have no ethics. Our\
  \ profession is to steal valuables. Here, there is no question of ethics. You don't\
  \ know the reality. This woman is possessing precious materials in her bag. These\
  \ are more valuable than gold and diamond of the marriage party. If you want to\
  \ become a reformed man, you are free to do so. Don\u2019t preach me your ethics\
  \ to me.\u201D said his friend.\n\n\"Friend, why you have changed the plan only\
  \ after boarding the train? Can you tell me why?\"\n\n\"I will explain to you afterwards.\
  \ Now you simply follow what I say,\" said the man in blue shirt.\n\n\"Friend, I\
  \ will not follow your direction, unless you tell me the fact.\"\n\nBhargavi was\
  \ closely watching their conversation and planning to get rid of them. There was\
  \ a heated argument between them. Other passengers woke up due to their shoutings.\
  \ Some of the youngsters in the marriage party came to the rescue of Bhargavi. Sensing\
  \ the anticipated danger, one of them pulled the chain. The train was in slow motion.\
  \ The youngsters caught hold of the two robbers. They decided to call the police\
  \ at Gulbarga station. It was a tough time for robbers to get out of the train.\
  \ The white shirt man was possessing a revolver, said, \"If you do not free both\
  \ of us, I will take out my automatic revolver and shoot all within few seconds.\
  \ There are sufficient bullets in the revolver.\"\n\nThe youngsters out of panicky\
  \ released the robbers. Everything was over within sixty seconds. The train was\
  \ still in slow motion before the station due to the pulling of the chain. The robbers\
  \ got down and escaped in the dark. The blue shirt man snatched her bag. It appears\
  \ from their action that both were professional robbers. They were successful in\
  \ their mission. The young lady was thinking that this must be the pre-planned plot.\
  \ Whose brain was behind this? She could not get the answer. Bhargavi thanked God\
  \ for saving her life from the gangsters."
