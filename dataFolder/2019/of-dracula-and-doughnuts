Text: "I spent last Halloween in Transylvania--a circumstance that had little to do\
  \ with Dracula and more to do with the fact that Bucharest was the cheapest last-minute\
  \ destination from my home base of Paris. Up to that point, my only associations\
  \ with Romania were famous gymnast Nadia Comaneci, infamous Communist-era dictator\
  \ Nicolae Ceau\u0219escu, and Count Dracula himself--all characters worth knowing\
  \ about, but most likely not representative of everything, or anything, the country\
  \ has to offer.\n\nEven so, leaning into the possibility of discovering the supernatural,\
  \ I made sure to locate a cheap English copy of Bram Stoker\u2019s Dracula in order\
  \ to achieve the right mood. By the time we arrived in Bucharest, I had already\
  \ finished the scant chapters of the book that take place in the hilly forests of\
  \ Transylvania, and was now immersed in the docklands of smoggy London.\n\nAs Romania\u2019\
  s tourism industry grew following the end of the totalitarian regime in 1989, the\
  \ country found itself reluctantly capitalizing on \u201CDracula tourism,\u201D\
  \ deferring to the surprising number of people who come to Romania specifically\
  \ in pursuit of vampires. Dracula tourism has been a huge economic boon, but is\
  \ considered by many to be a betrayal of Romanian culture and history. Grand plans\
  \ for a Dracula theme park, complete with amusement rides and a haunted castle,\
  \ eventually succumbed to international outcry in 2002.\n\nBut my first few hours\
  \ in Romania convinced me that whoever is in charge of Romanian tourism should abandon\
  \ all efforts to promote vampires, and attract tourists through something entirely\
  \ different. Starving from an early morning flight into Bucharest, my friend and\
  \ I walked from our apartment to one of the city\u2019s oldest restaurants, located\
  \ in a luxuriously decorated Neo-Gothic building. From our table on the second level,\
  \ beneath a gilded ceiling and across from arched stained-glass windows, we felt\
  \ as if we were dining in a cathedral. We ordered the multi-course lunch menu for\
  \ a grand total of 24 lei (around 5 euros). As soon as the first course arrived--a\
  \ steaming swamp of Romanian-style polenta, topped with piles of shredded sheeps\
  \ cheese and a fried egg, the overall effect of which was a kind of deconstructed\
  \ and delicious macaroni and cheese--we knew that we would be spending the rest\
  \ of the trip eating constantly.\n\nDrawing from a stew of culinary influences,\
  \ from the Ottoman Empire to Eastern European cuisines, the Romanian food tradition\
  \ has been developing for centuries: meats prepared with unusual spice combinations,\
  \ sheep cheeses of all different textures, satisfyingly sour soups, stuffed vegetables,\
  \ hearty piles of polenta, and magnificent desserts. All the restaurants we visited\
  \ entranced us with an unexpected and compelling blend of sweet and savory flavors.\n\
  \nAnd Romania doesn\u2019t just excel at its own traditional food: in each place\
  \ we stopped, from capital city Bucharest to the small university town of Sibiu,\
  \ we found the sort of bars and cafes that would have been unremarkable in hipster\
  \ neighborhoods of Brooklyn or London, many catering to modern food trends and offering\
  \ an international selection. It was these cafes where I discovered the wonder of\
  \ white hot chocolate, which I am crossing my fingers will come into vogue in the\
  \ rest of the world.\n\nPerhaps because it was what I expected to find, I saw elements\
  \ of the gothic all around me in Romania--birds swooping around the roofs of Bucharest\
  \ at dusk like bats beginning to wake; the colors of both the buildings and countryside\
  \ as we drove up and down the valleys of Transylvania, all shades of orange and\
  \ brown and red; and disintegrating ruins of buildings with glassless windows and\
  \ intruding vines. Even the castle that once belonged to Dracula\u2019s real-life\
  \ counterpart was almost as spooky as advertised.\n\nBut the part of my trip that\
  \ sticks in my memory, that I still think about at least once a week, is the papana\u0219\
  i I had for dessert on my last night in Romania--a single doughnut on a plate, coated\
  \ with knobbly fried breadcrumbs, the interior as dense as a drenched sponge, sitting\
  \ in a puddle of tangy Romanian-style sour cream swirled with a tart berry sauce,\
  \ as crimson as blood."
