Text: "Whenever somebody mentions \u201CIslam\u201D or \u201CMuslim\u201D to a feminist,\
  \ it will come mind a restrictive place, where women rights are denied, as well\
  \ the possibility of sorority. In fact, I never thought middle-eastern women had\
  \ a body or could bond in a more intimate way then western, until I say them fully\
  \ naked in a Hamas Bath, in my first trip to Morocco last year. \nWhen I told a\
  \ brazilian friend about going there, she instructed me: you must go there, it\u2019\
  s a unique experience. And I thought to myself, okay darling\u2026 you might have\
  \ never seen people naked, but I\u2019ve been to some naturalistic beaches before,\
  \ and it\u2019s not a big deal to see other women unclothed. I mean, I major in\
  \ theater, I saw that all the time in college.\nThe day I got there I said to my\
  \ - amazing - host family that I wanted to try a Hamas Bath, because I was unfamiliar\
  \ with the concept. They told me they would take me there, give the instruction\
  \ to the Hamas Bath Lady and then come back to pick me up. None of the women I met\
  \ and became friends with wanted to join me. So there I went, my male friend and\
  \ the only contact I had in Morocco, his younger sister, and his mom, Fatma. \n\
  Fatma is this amazing woman that took me into her house without knowing me, cooked\
  \ me exclusive vegetarian meals, even though all of them eat meat and embrace me\
  \ as one of them. She speaks arabic and french, I speak portuguese, english and\
  \ poor spanish, so we had to communicate through gestures, smiles and eyes. \nWhen\
  \ the car stopped, my friend told me men were not allowed inside those places, so\
  \ his mom would take me in. There I began to to realize how sacred and safe those\
  \ places were. We got into a simple lounge with some women seated behind a departament\
  \ counter. They spoke in arabic. It seems to me that whenever you don\u2019t understand\
  \ the language, the sentences always seem endless. But then she began to walk, I\
  \ followed  her. \nIt was a big space with high ceiling, white tiles everywhere\
  \ and a lot of natural lightening from round windows placed very near the roof.\
  \ Like a locker room, but more more aseptic. Still kind of foggy and warm. Fatma\
  \ made a gesture for me to strip, and I thought here we go. I have many tattoos,\
  \ big, colorful and a tramp one. I never thought I\u2019d be embarrassed of undressing,\
  \ but the concept muslims have of tattoo is somewhat of impure, and I was so attached\
  \ to that women that gave me a roof, food, many of her personal beauty products\
  \ and hugs since I got there, that I didn\u2019t wanted her to have a bad impression\
  \ of me. \nI kept my panties on, she said something I couldn\u2019t understand and\
  \ made a gesture with her hand. I took it off, put on my purse, which she kept -\
  \ like a mom would do for a kid that goes to swim practice -, stood up and went\
  \ towards a metal door hidden in the back. She gave me a bowl full of stuff, lufa,\
  \ two kinds of soap, or moisturizing? I don\u2019t know, I was overwhelmed by all\
  \ the products and  the scene that I could figure it out. Fatma spoke with a lady,\
  \ said something to me and left.\nThe light and the tiles of that room were the\
  \ same of the previous one, very bright. It was much warmer in there. The room had\
  \ several half shaped moon, Moroccan style syncs, with concrete and tiled benches\
  \ in front of them. In a full, but still comfortable arrangement there were women\
  \ of all ages sitting, bathing, talking, bonding. I remember seeing bodies of all\
  \ shapes, none of them with tattoos. The one that stroke me the most was a little\
  \ girl, alone in the corner. She was playing with her pink plastic kitchen utensils,\
  \ and for the time I was there I could figure out who her mom was. The marvelous\
  \ thing is it didn\u2019t mattered, she was safe, and her mom knew it."
