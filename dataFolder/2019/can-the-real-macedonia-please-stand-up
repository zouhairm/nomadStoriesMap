Text: "If you're like me all you heard of Macedonia growing up in the 90's was stories\
  \ of war, Mother Theresa and Alexander the Great. So when I found a cheap flight\
  \ there while exploring Europe of course I decided to explore it on my own and find\
  \ what the real Macedonia was all about. Taking off with little more than a backpack\
  \ if clothing I had no idea what I was about to find.\nUpon arrival to my boat-themed\
  \ hotel in heart of the capital city of Skopje I was amazed to find an incredible\
  \ mixture of Soviet-style architecture set against the periodic art nouveau buildings\
  \ of the current presidency. The desk clerk greeted is with such a greeting of genuine\
  \ welcoming that made the entire hotel truly feel like home. In fact I found that\
  \ this hospitable kindness is so much ingrained in Macedonian culture that whether\
  \ you are ordering a coffee or bargaining at the world-renowned old bazaar you were\
  \ bound to leave with a smile. \nI made my rounds to all the \"tourist\" sites,\
  \ which I put in the quotations because Skopje is still a hidden gem rucked away\
  \ in the Balkans with very few visitors. The old bazaar was at the forefront of\
  \ my things to do given the incredible history I found it had upon a quick Google\
  \ search. I was again greeted by smiling faces all welcoming me into their cafes,\
  \ jewelry shops and tapestry stands. Honestly, I lost track of time meandering the\
  \ narrow streets of shops learning of the Macedonian ruby and the historic debate\
  \ of Alexander the Great the nation has with Greece. It was only at the 12 o'clock\
  \ call to prayer that I realized I had been wandering the streets for nearly 3 hours\
  \ just chatting with locals as though they were old friends.  Add in the beautiful\
  \ main square, delicious food and beer to rival those of Germany and Belgium Macedonia\
  \ was so much more than just a war-torn state lost in time to the ex-Yugoslav Republic.\
  \ It is a country of religious and cultural harmony, unmatched hospitality and a\
  \ history that though turbulent, has made Macedonia what it is today. Go now before\
  \ the crowds get word of all the riches Skopje, Ohrid and the rest of Macedonia\
  \ holds. And, as the locals will tell you, be sure to try the watermelon."
