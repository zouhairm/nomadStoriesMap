Text: "I was thirteen years old when i first went to Fiji Islands because of my dad\
  \ as he was transferred from India. I found myself in a difficult situation because\
  \ the time difference was six hours. The days became the night and vice a versa.\
  \ But, the best part of the islands was that it has lush greenery all around and\
  \ the roads were elevated at every corner. Then, we came across sand dunes where\
  \ we went on climbing for hours and hours. Fun though as we didn\u2019t expect to\
  \ find a clean deserted ocean filled with corals,crabs and trees on the other side\
  \ of the mountain. There are 360 islands around that place also called as Samoan\
  \ islands. From that we came across another mountain which paved the way towards\
  \ the clouds. It was raining on top of that place and everything looked serene.\
  \ We could only see the green places surrounding that area. \nWe went to one of\
  \ the islands where we were using a cruise to get there. Far away from the main\
  \ land, I saw colour of the water changing from light blue to dark blue as we were\
  \ approaching the island. The locals would welcome us with their traditional Bulla\
  \ dress. Boys over there seemed like they were Africa and would wear a flowered\
  \ shirt ,below that would be Bulla skirt. Women would wear Bulla bikini model dress\
  \ and hold Jasmine flowers to welcome us and give elders a traditional drink called\
  \ the cava drink which is served in pot like cup. Children get normal drinks or\
  \ chocolates . Well, we had all be fascinated to have that but, we were not that\
  \ lucky . \nSo, this was just a jist of what i had experienced . Once you go to\
  \ that land there is no coming back because the life ends quite early  and nature\
  \ is high. So, Fiji should be in everyone\u2019s bucket list for one reason atleast\
  \ that Christmas is being celebrated during summer season and in winter we get a\
  \ break. \nSimple life and there its even simpler."
