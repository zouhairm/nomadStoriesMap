Text: "The night of January 31st, when I boarded my first ever flight with 100 other\
  \ passengers, when I went past the shiny abode of clouds and thought I would soon\
  \ reach the moon, when there were 100 others but I felt lonely I had never thought\
  \ what I was about to witness in the next 3 days. On the morning of 1st February\
  \ I landed on Suvarnabhumi International Airport, Bangkok, Thailand.\n\nThe bright\
  \ sunshine reflecting through the steel roofs of the cabs moving outside the airport\
  \ were glaring into my eyes. The brightness of the Sun, and the different atmosphere\
  \ propelled me to explore the city in a different way compared to other tourists.\
  \ I decided to take the subway.\nThe organiser had booked a room for every delegate\
  \ in Windsor Suites & Convention. With my backpack on my back I reached the building.\
  \ The glares of sun reflected from it\u2019s massive structure and brightened the\
  \ entire area around it. I stood outside astounded, not at just the beauty of the\
  \ hotel but with how bright the Sun could shine. I took out my shades and made my\
  \ way to the room. A massive room compared to the hotel rooms back home. With white\
  \ walls, embarking peace to the soul, the white bed sheets on the bouncy mattress\
  \ just shouting comfort, and saying \u201Ccome to me, it\u2019s sleeping time\u201D\
  , a dim yellow light to create the mood with a study table just beside my bed with\
  \ a table lamp to create a working environment.\nAs the night arrived, I decided\
  \ to move towards the ocean, took a cab to reach the beach. During my journey I\
  \ looked at the traffic on the roads of Bangkok. I even realised, that no matter\
  \ where you are on Earth, it\u2019s always going to be too much traffic for you.\
  \ It\u2019s funny how everybody is in a hurry but everyone runs late. Soon, I reached\
  \ the beach. The beach, with it\u2019s small shacks had a different ambience from\
  \ the rest of the busy city. A silent ocean, rustling trees and the peaceful moon\
  \ reflected from the large mirror that water is. It seemed to be a different country.\
  \ As I walked down the beach closer to the ocean in it\u2019s high tide, I saw a\
  \ group of similar faces, sitting in a circle with a beer bottle between them. I\
  \ walked towards them, only to realise they were fellow delegates from the Organiser.\
  \ I was alone on that beach and decided there was no point in not trying to make\
  \ friends. I approached them, had a little chat and joined them for the game of\
  \ truth and dare.\n\nAs the bottle got bored of being rotated around the same monotonous\
  \ faces and we were out of ideas of questions and tasks, we decided to go the nearest\
  \ bar for a couple of drinks. A bar just round the corner named Drinks on me was\
  \ chosen. We entered the bar, a tiny ambience with a very low accommodation. We\
  \ were lucky enough to grab a table. A live music band performing just added to\
  \ the shabby-chic decor maintained by the bar. Don\u2019t get me wrong they all\
  \ are compliments. I ordered myself the recommendation, their famous classic gin\
  \ and tonic. We had drinks as we slowly lost our senses to the alcohol and the groove\
  \ of the music. We all talked and discussed our strategies for the upcoming conference,\
  \ and never understood how the conversation reached where we started discussing\
  \ the name of the hospital I was born in and some more adventures of me and everybody.\n\
  \nThe inevitable day had arrived. The gloomy morning of 3rd of February, I woke\
  \ up in my bed with the sadness of leaving the country which had given me so much\
  \ to think about when I go back home. I had booked a cab, with my luggage I left\
  \ the hotel. The overwhelming sadness took over me as I video recorded the road\
  \ I was travelling saying a final goodbye to Bangkok, Thailand. I reached the Suvarnabhumi\
  \ International airport. From the place I started this beautiful journey; I had\
  \ come a full circle."
