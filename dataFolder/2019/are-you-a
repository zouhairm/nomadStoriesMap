Text: "It is not well known that 120 years ago this year, Japanese migrated to Peru\
  \ for the first time officially seeking a better life like any other immigrants\
  \ around the world.  There is no differences between other nations, japanese are\
  \ also just human. \n\nI was so excited to see one of the world most wonder heritages\
  \ \"Machu Picchu\". The mystery has not been discovered fully and is so  fascinating\
  \ to learn the history of Inka. The people visit there looked that they were not\
  \ very interested in the history but more in taking photos, selfying photos and\
  \ not listening to what their guides were saying. The tourists did not even care\
  \ where they sit, stand or leave rubbish behind at the site. The Machu Picchu protect\
  \ officers told the tourists what appropriate or not, looking very sick of saying\
  \ the same everyday to them. \n\nI was the same among the tourists, taking photos\
  \ not knowing what the history of the site. \"EXCEPT\" I was collecting the rubbish\
  \ previous stupid tourists  left there! \n\nWalking and learning more and more about\
  \ the history of Machu Picchu, I felt i was shame what I had done there just 10\
  \ minutes ago. I felt more respect towards the site and stopped taking photos, started\
  \ looking around Machu Picchu. Most of all, taking photos is just waist of time\
  \ after all. Then I found myself trying to engage where I was and felt the air,\
  \ the mountains and the weather surrounded me. No one knows where the people of\
  \ Inka went. I was imaging whether they went down the mountains or were integrated\
  \ in other societies or relocated themselves into new ares. \n\nAfter I left Macchu\
  \ Picchu and Aguas Calientes, headed to the capital of Peru, Lima leaving behind\
  \ the spectacular mountain ranges.  \nLima was a good example of comparison between\
  \ ancient city and modern one just after machu Picchu: millions of people moving\
  \ around by buses and cars, the traffic was so heavy, there were shops everywhere\
  \ and more.\n\nI had no plans in Lima like I do not plan so much in my everyday\
  \ life. But accidentally I found the museum of japanese immigration to Peru en Jes\xFA\
  s Mar\xEDa Lima. As I am Japanese and volunteer as an interpreter for people from\
  \ overseas in Japan occasionally, I became interested to learn Japanese immigrated\
  \ into Peru! I It was other way around some Japanese immigrated to different country\
  \ as the people I help for in Japan. \n\nIt happened to be 120 years anniversary\
  \ for Japanese immigration this year 2019.  The history teller panels informing\
  \ me little history about the immigration but I believe there would have been more\
  \ both goods and not so goods happened during the settlements for Japanese, my ancestors.\
  \ \n\nSomewhere in the world, there are always people looking for better life opportunity,\
  \ and no one can stop it. It is natural as people have used to do for a long time\
  \ due to war, natural deserters or political reasons etc. I thought japanese moved\
  \ to Peru had one of the reasons to migrate. \n\nIn the same building, there was\
  \ a day care centre was attached and there are many peruviano-japanesa (peruvian-japanese)\
  \ elderies go for a day. \nMost of them are 2nd generation of peruvian-japanese\
  \ speaking Spanish. They are very much integrated into the Peruvian society very\
  \ well. One of the peruvian-japanese women I spoke to was able to speak little japanese.\
  \ My parents were japanese, said the woman. WHAT? What about you? you are not japanese?\
  \ talking to myself. This experience surprised me very much because they look so\
  \ much japanese but insides are not japanese at all. I learnt that this was how\
  \ people were integrated into new country and change their identity not noticing\
  \ they were doing it. Thinking about the people of Inka in Machu Picchu, they might\
  \ have been similarly mingled into new places.\n  \nRight now writing this, I am\
  \ in Australia living in different country. \nI am not married yet but one day my\
  \ kids may be saying \"I am Aussie\" not japanese...  lol\nThat is how the world\
  \ is and will be.  \n\nOnly god knows where we will be and life is like travelling.\
  \ No?"
