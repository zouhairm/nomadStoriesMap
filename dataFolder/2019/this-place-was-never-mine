Text: "Standing on top of the steps leading up to the enormous stone sculpture at\
  \ the entrance to the grounds, I didn't know quite where to look. Should I be staring\
  \ down the path to the wooden barracks, empty since 1945, that stood hauntingly\
  \ alone in the field? Or maybe if I shifted my gaze further down the path, I would\
  \ see the curved half-dome of the monument at the other end of the camp; the one\
  \ containing all of the ashes, where I would later sit, bare legs pressed against\
  \ the spring flowers and the grass, and cry. I would cry more than once on this\
  \ trip; more times than I could count, by the time I wheeled my carry on bag onto\
  \ the plane home, two weeks later. \n\n    I was in Poland with a relative, a Holocaust\
  \ survivor, to visit the sites. To bear witness. What I did not expect, was to be\
  \ absolutely bowled over by an attachment to a place I had never been. To be, as\
  \ I was for most of the days I was there, stunned into silence by how much my heart\
  \ ached for a language I might have known under different historical circumstances.\
  \ When I walked through the forests, the leaves beneath my feet felt heavier - the\
  \ trees taller. I found myself quietly taking photos and listening, and that those\
  \ two things occupied most of my days, and I was fine with it. On one of the first\
  \ days of being there, I ran out of film for my camera - I was on a two week trip\
  \ and, in the first two days, shot three rolls of film. So, after a brief detour\
  \ to find somewhere with the proper film, I reloaded, and we headed off again, into\
  \ new but somehow familiar territory. \n\n    We travelled to many different sites\
  \ - Majdanek Concentration Camp, the memorial at Treblinka, forests that were the\
  \ sites of mass murders, the memorial at Belzec, a place called Radegast train station\
  \ where we stood in a cattle car and I listened; I listened to stories of survival,\
  \ and to stories of loss so massive I couldn't quite wrap my head around it, but\
  \ at the same time, I could feel it in my bones. As we drove around the country\
  \ I talked to people - asking about their lives, about the history of these places\
  \ they called home. I stood outside of a small house near one of the last synagogues,\
  \ a place steeped in history and tragedy, but also a place of so many celebrations,\
  \ and wondered what kinds of people had walked across the floors; what kinds of\
  \ things the walls had seen. Memory can be a funny thing, especially when introduced\
  \ to trauma; the stories that I was hearing helped me not only get a better sense\
  \ of the place I was in physically, but of the space I was in mentally, of myself.\
  \ \n\n\n    For weeks after I got back home, I didn't sleep well. I went back to\
  \ school and stared at textbook pages and tried to figure out how to process this\
  \ feeling of longing for a home that was never mine, this aching for a time before\
  \ an atrocity that never happened to me, that happened decades before I was born.\
  \ As a writer I struggled to come to terms with it - how I could properly write\
  \ about this experience, how I could possibly do it justice. This place was never\
  \ mine, but as I slept on the flight back, my mind tossing and turning over every\
  \ detail of the trip, every small gust of wind or every long, deep breath of fresh\
  \ air I'd so thankfully taken, it felt like it could have been."
