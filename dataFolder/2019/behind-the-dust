Text: "There is something eternally alluring about ancient Chinese villages. No matter\
  \ how many one visits, they always seem to capture the imagination despite the fact\
  \ that most of them are relatively the same. They are usually built around a stream,\
  \ sometimes several, which meander through the village before emptying out into\
  \ the surrounding countryside. Across the streams stretch bridges and alongside\
  \ them run the village\u2019s paths, which are bookended by whitewashed buildings\
  \ whose namesake color has been slowly overtaken by the creeping, black march of\
  \ mildew across their walls. Ornate wooden carvings hang from the buildings\u2019\
  \ uppermost floors, and cavernous rooms fill their interiors, both tellers of the\
  \ village\u2019s past glories. The present state of the wood however, worn and faded,\
  \ tell of the current lack of it. And while many of these villages have the air\
  \ of a repurposed tourist attraction, there are still pockets within them that give\
  \ you a glimpse into what life was like when their purpose was being lived in rather\
  \ than visited. Down alleyways not meant to be looked down, through doors mistakenly\
  \ left open, if you look in the right places, a picture of life in the village still\
  \ exists and is essential to the appreciation of it.\n\nAnother trait all of the\
  \ villages seem to share, quite obviously, is their title of \u201Cvillage,\u201D\
  \ which means that no matter how interesting they may be, their capacity for exploration\
  \ is limited. So, after exploring all the corners of Small Likeng, those both hidden\
  \ and in plain sight, I soon found myself nearing its outer limits. As I drew closer\
  \ to the end of the path I was walking along, there seemed to be a perfect balance\
  \ between the dissipation of foot traffic on it and the buildup of dust in the storefront\
  \ windows, a testament to their limited visitors and even more limited sales. Fully\
  \ aware of this situation, I kept my eyes fixated on the scenery straight ahead\
  \ for I knew that any glance, however brief, at a given item would undoubtedly elicit\
  \ a desperate \u201Chello\u201D from the shop owner in an attempt to startle me\
  \ into eye contact and, as a result, lure me into their shop for a look.\n\nJust\
  \ before reaching the edge of town, my unflinching gaze was broken as I peeked over\
  \ to an antique shop that had caught the interest of my peripherals. The shop was\
  \ owned by a kindly old woman who seemed very proud of the different trinkets she\
  \ had on display, which were barely visible beneath the thick layer of dust sitting\
  \ on top of them. As I looked around, one particular item caught my eye: a tiny\
  \ vase yellowed by time with a traditional Chinese painting covering its body. I\
  \ had never seen anything like it before and enthusiastically told the shop owner\
  \ that I\u2019d like to purchase it. As I handed over my money, questions about\
  \ the vase\u2019s past coursed through my mind. Was it a family heirloom handed\
  \ down from generation to generation? Was it found buried in a field while a farmer\
  \ was digging a well? Was it painted during the village\u2019s heyday by one of\
  \ the many artists that called its streets home? I couldn\u2019t be for sure, but\
  \ one thing I did know: it was special.\n\nAs I began making my way out of the village\
  \ though, in a cruel blow to the contentedness I had with my purchase, I passed\
  \ shop after shop selling the exact vase I had just bought. With each one I convinced\
  \ myself that that must be the only other one in existence in a desperate attempt\
  \ to maintain the mystery that my vase had held just moments before. By the fifth\
  \ shop though, my mysterious antique vase had completed its sad and all too quick\
  \ descent into a common souvenir. Still clinging to some hope of its uniqueness,\
  \ I told myself that the vases are only from that particular village and am really\
  \ hoping I don\u2019t see one anywhere in Shanghai."
