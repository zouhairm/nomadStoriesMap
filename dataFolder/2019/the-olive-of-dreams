Text: "I still remember it perfectly. It was during difficult times in June, ten years\
  \ ago when the A1 epidemic in Mexico was taking many victims. At that time I was\
  \ a recent graduate of the faculty of Architecture, working as a draftsman, making\
  \ architectural plans for a hospital in the southern part of my country. \nI applied\
  \ for a postgraduate scholarship to Europe, a boarding program with students from\
  \ all Spanish-speaking countries to a small town called Palos de la Frontera in\
  \ the south, however this time to the south of Spain. My life has always moved in\
  \ this direction: the South. Unsuspectingly, I would travel the same route Christopher\
  \ Columbus travelled in 1542, but in the opposite direction. I would not conquer\
  \ continents but rather, embark on a voyage to self-search and auto-conquer. \n\
  I received the scholarship! And of coarse I was happy, I left my country for Spain\
  \ with a knapsack full of illusions. I went to this sort of boarding school that\
  \ functioned like Big Brother. I got to know Europe and was able to learn new thing.\
  \ I made new friends, most of them from South America; I discovered new idea about\
  \ Architecture, new songs, new places that were nowhere on my map, new hopes, new\
  \ illusions. I learnt new words, and a whole new Southamerican and European universe\
  \ which up to that point were unknown to me. \n\nIn exchange, many heard my music,\
  \ my Spanish, my not-so-good Portuguese.  Since the moment I arrived, I became aware\
  \ of many things. I perceived that all the Spanish-speaking countries have similar\
  \ needs, but also coincide in goodness and fraternity. I became aware of this through\
  \ the friendly words and greetings, which came from my classmates. In truth, time\
  \ elapsed quickly and everything seemed great (except for the applied physics classes\
  \ and the thermodynamics exercises, which no one wanted to remember), so simple,\
  \ so free, so new, so singular. Liberating. We would go for outings and I got to\
  \ know new and marvelous place like Seville, La Alhambra, Lisbon, Faro, Sintra\u2026\
  \ we travelled to Africa, and in Morocco we were able to learn about the arab life\
  \ in a cosmopolitan city called Marrakech; name which curiously signifies \u201C\
  go quickly\u201D. It is a city, different, where the past, the present, the culture,\
  \ the languages, get all mixed among the people and the buildings. Where anything\
  \ has a price, which can be bargained. When you first arrive, you have the terrible\
  \ sensation that you can get lost, and in effect, we did get lost. \nWe would walk,\
  \ leaving our footprints in the sand, on the detailed cobbled streets of Lisbon,\
  \ we would go for Tapas, we ate Portuguese Estofado while listening to melancholic\
  \ Fado songs. We would wake up, all jetlagged and run to see the sunrise, some would\
  \ play football while some of us smoked, sometimes we would all meet to have a good\
  \ Colombian coffee; anything was a great excuse to share and be together. \nWe would\
  \ all go together everywhere, some more together than other, but in the end we were\
  \ a great group. We would listen to the songs of the \u201Cshower singers\u201D\
  . We would share the little sound proof of the University dorm walls and in that\
  \ way, we were also able to share secrets. I would travel, we would dance, some\
  \ would play football, while some of us smoked, we drank coffee and we would also\
  \ speak of out countries. \nThis trip has been the most inspiring trip of my life\
  \ because I was able to discover that, the further away you are, you can observe,\
  \ you can touch, you can feel, you can smell things more deliberately. I filled\
  \ my knapsack with friends and experiences. \nTravelling is marvelous because it\
  \ fills you with valuable and profound memories; and remembering this particular\
  \ trip, is like self-recover.  Trying to grasp a moment in time with sweetness,\
  \ with love, with a lack of affection, with pain, with happiness. The adult me tells\
  \ the young me: you need to travel, life is beautiful, so short and fragile, that\
  \ this is the only thing that remains in the end; life experiences, the profound\
  \ moments.  The olive of dreams."
