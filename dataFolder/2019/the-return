Text: "I recently visited Djursholm, Sweden. A small village, filled with old, majestic\
  \ homes, it borders the Baltic Sea. My father was working for a month at the Mittag-Leffler\
  \ Institute, a center for the study of mathematics. My father is a mathematician,\
  \ and is sometimes invited to faraway places to teach and work with other mathematicians.\
  \ He invited me to stay with him in Sweden for a few days. I went, not realizing\
  \ what I would find. \n\tSweden holds a mythical place in my mind. When I was six,\
  \ I spent a year living in Djursholm with my family, far from our home in Virginia.\
  \ My father was on a sabbatical at the Institute. In my memory, it was one of the\
  \ best years of my childhood. Djursholm is a peaceful and safe community. The Baltic\
  \ Sea, cold and formidable, is one of the quietest oceans I have ever seen, and\
  \ one that has ice floes through springtime. It wraps Djursholm in an expansive\
  \ embrace. There is something about cold places, a stillness you don\u2019t find\
  \ in warmer climates.\t\n\tI attended public school where we called our teacher\
  \ by her first name. The children there were loving and affectionate. The children\
  \ of the Institute\u2019s faculty played together non-stop. The year we lived there,\
  \ it snowed more than it had in one hundred years. There were snow drifts 9 feet\
  \ high, and we built tunnels under the snow. Playing outside, we were totally unaffected\
  \ by the below freezing temperatures, enjoying ourselves while snow clumped on our\
  \ hand-knitted mittens. \n\tMy parents weren\u2019t so lucky. Their marriage was\
  \ on the rocks that year, and they were stressed. While the year in Sweden was one\
  \ of my favorite years, it was a difficult one for them. They eventually divorced.\n\
  \tGoing back there now, over thirty years later, I wondered if I would feel any\
  \ old tugs about my childhood. When I arrived, I was stunned at how it matched my\
  \ memory. The Institute itself a castle-like pink building up on a hill. The only\
  \ difference was the hill - it wasn\u2019t as tall as I remembered. But the yellow\
  \ house split up into faculty apartments was still there. I walked past the house\
  \ and peered in the window, having memories of sitting with my parents and their\
  \ friends, watching them drink wine. \n\tWe visited my father\u2019s friend Ingve\
  \ at the old-age home down the road. Ninety years old, and almost blind, he complained\
  \ of boredom at lying in bed all the time. I remembered Ingve well. This time he\
  \ called me a \u201Cgood lady\u201D instead of a \u201Cgood girl.\u201D I held his\
  \ hand and felt transported to a time of innocence. \n\tWhen it was time for me\
  \ to move on - I was headed south to Berlin to visit a friend - I visited Ingve\
  \ one last time. I kissed him on the cheek, and he made me promise I would tell\
  \ my mother hello, \u201Cfrom my heart,\u201D he said. \n\tAs I walked back from\
  \ the nursing home, I veered onto the street that led to the ocean. I began to sense\
  \ how parts of the soul of my childhood family still lived in this part of the world.\
  \ \n\tWhen I reached the sea, I looked out over the cracked ice, into the choppy\
  \ water. Despite the cold weather people were outside, getting exercise, taking\
  \ in the view. I found myself saying a prayer. My prayer took on a life of its own,\
  \ and I felt the souls of my family were being liberated from Djursholm. The parts\
  \ of us that had gotten stuck there were being seen and set free, to heal and resolve\
  \ their confusions and worries.\n\tI turned and walked back to the apartment. I\
  \ finished packing and stepped outside, pulling my suitcase through the icy gravel\
  \ to the bus stop. My father and I had already said our goodbyes that morning. As\
  \ I sat on the bus, I noticed that the little girl who had lived in Djursholm -\
  \ she was with me, inside of me. I don\u2019t know if she was there before, but\
  \ she was there now. \n\tI knew something had healed. And it was time to go."
