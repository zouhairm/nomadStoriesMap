Text: "I am a \u201CJersey Boy\u201D, through and through. The lyrics of Frankie Valli\
  \ & The Four Seasons and Bruce \u201CThe Boss\u201D Springsteen flow from my lips\
  \ easier than breathing, my heritage includes the stereotypical Roman Catholic Sicilian\
  \ blood (my mother raised us to stress we\u2019re Sicilian, not Italian), and I\
  \ love to boast about our coveted bagels without hesitation. Growing up, though,\
  \ I always found myself dispatching my astral projection beyond the borders of New\
  \ Jersey and New York City to answer the random questions occupying my mind; how\
  \ does a sunrise look in Zimbabwe? How clean are the waters of Kiribati? What do\
  \ they eat for breakfast in India? In January 2017, I would be able to live the\
  \ answer to one of those questions as my firm approached me with an opportunity\
  \ for an assignment to Bangalore (now Bengaluru). \n\nThree months quickly evaporated\
  \ and before I knew it, I was sitting business class on a plane to \u201CIncredible\
  \ India\u201D for two years. I have never been more restless than that flight, not\
  \ out of fear, but the idea of leaping into a culture drastically different from\
  \ my own was \u2013 exhilarating. Up to that point, I lived in South Carolina for\
  \ five years, which was my benchmark of experiencing a different culture. Disappointing\
  \ for a man rapidly approaching thirty.\n\nMy initial time in India, did not go\
  \ as I had imagined. In my first two months I was attacked three times, my flat\
  \ was initially infested with rats, and had no hot water. At night in bed, while\
  \ trying to ignore the scurrying sounds of rodents, I would stare out the barred\
  \ window and wonder if I made the wrong choice. None of my inner circle was able\
  \ to adjust to the hour difference, not even my family, so communication with the\
  \ \u201Chomeland\u201D was scarce and attributed to thoughts of isolation and loneliness.\
  \ It was on these nights where I could feel a wall being constructed within me,\
  \ stone by stone. There were bright spots here and there, such as celebrating Navaratri\
  \ and dancing the dandiya with friends in Hyderabad, exploring the lush hills of\
  \ Coorg, and visiting the mesmerizing Taj Mahal of Agra. By the end of my first\
  \ year, though, I was 30 pounds (15kgs) lighter, dark rings formed around my eyes,\
  \ and felt as if I endured enough pollution to knock a few years off my life.\n\n\
  Everything changed March 4, 2018. In an attempt to meet a few Westerners, I attended\
  \ a function at a local pub near Garuda Mall and while there, I met the most beautiful\
  \ and fascinating woman I\u2019ve ever met, Sneha. If I could describe her in two\
  \ words, \u201Clife-changing\u201D. I didn\u2019t know it at the time, but Sneha\
  \ was an accomplished actress in the Sandalwood industry (Bengaluru\u2019s Hollywood).\n\
  \nOver the next few months, Sneha taught me the philosophies of Hinduism, the epic\
  \ stories of the Ramayana and the Mahabharata, and further exposed me to India\u2019\
  s diversity, history, cuisine, traditions, and the oh-so-many festivals. We would\
  \ often sneak away (as our relationship was a secret) to admire the stone carved\
  \ temples of Karnataka or to teach me the local language, Kannada. With her, I felt\
  \ my wall crumbling and a yearning to explore and understand more of the world.\n\
  \nBy September 2018, Sneha and I were engaged and her family welcomed me with open\
  \ arms. Our wedding in November was covered by the news and accommodated 5,000 guests.\
  \ I am now so entwined with the Indian culture that I extended my assignment to\
  \ India by a year because there is still so much for me to learn and see. I wear\
  \ kurtas regularly, speak broken Kannada to the locals and, from time to time, appear\
  \ with Sneha when she is a guest on talk shows. I can\u2019t imagine my life now\
  \ without Sneha or India. When we move back to the US in 2020, I know we will be\
  \ taking India with us. \n\nOh, in case you were wondering, a typical South Indian\
  \ breakfast is idli, a steamed rice cake, with sombar and/or coconut chutney, but\
  \ Sneha and I prefer just the chutney. It\u2019s simple, healthy, and delicious."
