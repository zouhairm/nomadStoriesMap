Text: "It was a half days of waiting without certainty. I arrived in the Alenby border\
  \ between Jordan and Israel early in the morning, my visa status has been approved\
  \ at that time. I didn\u2019t expect that I need another official approval to pass\
  \ the border. I sat and wait in the waiting room, hoping that my name will be called\
  \ by the officer telling me that they allow me to pass every time I heard the phone\
  \ rang. They hold my passport. An hour, two-hour, three, there was no sign that\
  \ they will call my name even after a hundred phone calls. \n\u201CMr. Delyardy.\u201D\
  \ \nI heard the officer finally called my name after 6 hours. My heart beat faster,\
  \ between happy and worry. \n\u201CYou may pass the border NOW\u201D, he said. \n\
  I hopped into the transfer car to the next borderline. There was a long queue of\
  \ other cars on the other side. Here comes the second layer checking. One full-armed\
  \ officer knocking on our car\u2019s door for a random checking, the driver open\
  \ it, he stares to everyone in the car before allowing us to go through to the immigration\
  \ check. I passed the 3 layers immigration check and got my permit to finally enter\
  \ the country. Next destination: Jerusalem. I have already felt starving when the\
  \ minibus stopped at a restaurant in Jericho for transit. We stopped there for about\
  \ an hour or two before continuing the trip to Jerusalem.\nIt was about 5 pm when\
  \ I arrived in the old city, Jerusalem. The weather was getting colder, and a little\
  \ pouring rain. But it doesn\u2019t hold me to stay in my hotel room. I walk around\
  \ outside the wall of the old city, I want to feel the ambience, I want to breathe\
  \ the air, and see the people around. I see soldiers here and there, equipped with\
  \ rifle and gun. At the same time, kids running around and play a fool one another.\
  \ It seems like they just got used with the armed soldier around them.\nI order\
  \ street food kebab for dinner when I found myself getting involved in a conversation\
  \ with some locals. They notice that I\u2019m a tourist. They asked me to join them\
  \ out for coffee that night, they\u2019re Palestinian. There\u2019s no language\
  \ gap since every one of us speaking English. We talked like we were a long lost\
  \ friend. They ask me to tell stories about my country and my travel experience.\
  \ They shared their daily life in the conflicted area and their dreams of having\
  \ a chance to travel the world. They\u2019re facing difficulties, they said, especially\
  \ in travelling abroad. We spent hours of warm conversation and laugh and exchange\
  \ contact before they drop me back to my hotel.\nI spent the next couple of days\
  \ for a little tour inside the wall and continue with surrounding cities. I visited\
  \ the mosques, churches, and the famous western wall. Reminiscing history has never\
  \ been this good. I like the openness of the people of different religions to a\
  \ visitor like me. I was warned about the long-happening conflict between Israel\
  \ \u2013 Palestine before I arrived, and I can feel the tension somehow high in\
  \ the border. However, here inside the city of Jerusalem I feel at peace, I feel\
  \ secure to take a walk alone as a stranger in the middle of nowhere. I feel safe\
  \ to make a conversation with anyone I met. Warmly greeted by the priest, smile\
  \ on each other with the Jew on the street. I even talked with the soldier in the\
  \ gate of the old city, they said they are not supposed to talk too much, but it\u2019\
  s OK. Look scary at the beginning, but the ice just melted once we greet each other.\n\
  I did having a little-unexpected experience in Hebron. When there are suddenly soldiers\
  \ coming to the Mosque of Ibrahim without any warning where there were a student\
  \ visits inside the mosque. They\u2019re obviously looking for something or someone,\
  \ and we were stuck inside the mosque for a couple of hours. This trip unexpectedly\
  \ has brought me to another level of travelling experience. I will definitely go\
  \ back to Jerusalem."
