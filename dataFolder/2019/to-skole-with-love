Text: "\"Crazy mademoiselle from Kiev\" \u2013 they probably thought about me. If\
  \ a normal girl can come for a few days in a god-forgotten village without a boyfriend,\
  \ and even without a company of noisy friends, arguing that she did not want to\
  \ let her plans to ruin? Alone, with a giant backpack, camera and a book. Says she\
  \ will enjoy the silence and look at the stars, if it won`t be cloudy at night.\
  \ She sunbathes on the meadow between the river and somebody's gardens, walks in\
  \ obscure routes, trying to pat all oncoming cats and saying \u201CHello!\u201D\
  \ to dogs, while from the old-ones\u2019 greeting \"Glory to Jesus Christ!\" gets\
  \ into a stupor. Sleeps long, does not watch TV and does not even request a password\
  \ from Wi-Fi.\n\n\u201CShe is definitely weird. Or a witch. Well, at least she is\
  \ not hungry\u201D \u2013 is read in the eyes of Mrs. Orysia, who pours me a homemade\
  \ soup with white mushrooms and carefully serves sandwiches with Drogobych sausage.\
  \ \n\nYou are so slowing down in this small village, pinched between the mountains\
  \ in three hours away from Lviv, that when you draw attention to it, it seems unreal.\
  \ There you smile a lot. Everywhere in the streets it is a smell of pancakes, smoke\
  \ and apples. And so many cats that it seems like this city is theirs, not people\u2019\
  s. I made many pictures there, each of which \u2013 a separate memory which goes\
  \ beyond those photos.\n\nFor example, coming back from an unnamed mountain, to\
  \ which a path between the huts led. Sneakers of my \u201Cforest-spirit\u201D blew\
  \ in thickets not far ahead, indicating that I was returning the right way. However,\
  \ it seemed he was not sure that he is going right, because systematically, as for\
  \ self-complacency, looked at me. And we descended \u2013 turning around the turn,\
  \ until were lost in the streets of the forever dreamy village.\n\nAlso, it was\
  \ fun when you are sunbathing on the river banks, closing your eyes for a second\
  \ to fully enjoy the sun's rays, open \u2013 and a goat is near you. Such kind of\
  \ respected and horny one. And the right to own the whole territory and that piece\
  \ of grass that you are sitting on is read in her glance. Moreover, her \"mee-e-e\"\
  \ is so reproachful, as if you did lose all your conscience...\n\nIn the afternoon,\
  \ the fishermen come. They threw the hooks in the water and slowly moved along the\
  \ shore, as conveying the fish with their presence. One moment they probably got\
  \ tired of walking on grass, so somehow magically transformed their high boots into\
  \ waterproof overalls and plunged knee-deep into the river, testing their Fisherman's\
  \ fate there. During three days I have never seen any of them capture anything,\
  \ but they still did not look disappointed.\n\nOn the eve of departure, a ten-year-old\
  \ girl ran up to me and in a business tone inquired: \u201CYou are Helena?\u201D\
  \ \u2013 \u2018No\u201D. \u2013 \u201CAnd who is Helena?\u201D \u2013 \u201CI don\u2019\
  t know.\u201D \u2013 \u201CAlors, comment t'appelle tu et que fais-tu ici?\u201D\
  \ \u2013 \u201CJe m'appelle Eug\xE9nie et je me repose ici pendant mes vacances.\
  \ Et qui es tu?\u201D \u2013 \u201CDo you know French?\u201D \u2013 Her eyes were\
  \ full of surprise. \u2013 \u201CYes, as you see. So who are you and what are you\
  \ doing here?\u201D \u2013 \u201CI am Veronica; this is my younger brother, and\
  \ there \u2013 my uncle. He is a boss here until his boxers rest.\u201D And here\
  \ the boxers began to jump from the rock into the river. In such an ordinary mountain\
  \ river, you know, where the water is on the knee and solid stones at the bottom.\
  \ They swam to it, climbed a two-meter-high rock on the opposite bank and jumped\
  \ down, while their friends, laughing, took it all on the video. And while I, with\
  \ a fading heart, thought if they would kill themselves or not. [Hopefully, the\
  \ locals have guided them to the right rock]. Interesting performance and beautiful.\
  \ Especially when one of them, full of internal confidence, jumped gracefully, without\
  \ waiting anyone, and so calmly went to the shore, satisfied mostly with a jump\
  \ than just with himself... \n\nI think I will come back there again sometime. And\
  \ in the Lower Synyovydne, because the name is too nice."
