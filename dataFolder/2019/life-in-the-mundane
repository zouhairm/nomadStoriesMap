Text: "I didn't expect to find solace in cake. \n\nJust months before, I'd been blissfully\
  \ unaware of the shit storm headed my way. With love for another my anchor, I made\
  \ the journey from Barbados to the grey isle excited at the prospect of calling\
  \ it home. I explored the nooks and crannies of Huddersfield, a northern university\
  \ town almost as bored of itself as residents are of it. For me though, this boiling\
  \ pot of \"the everyday\" was the start of us truly building our lives together,\
  \ and I quickly fell in love with its mundane exterior. Below the surface, far more\
  \ volatile forces were at work.\n\nIn midst of my exploration and giddy-headed excitement,\
  \ betrayal reared its head. Less than weeks later, the man I thought I'd be with\
  \ forever, no longer shared my bed.\n\nHeartbroken, one night I wondered the streets,\
  \ unable to muster enough energy to stave off rain spatter or the homeless' quest\
  \ for spare change. The late hour suggested I stumble into a pub for comfort, and\
  \ I almost did, when flashes of red and pink caught my eye.\n\nA vibrant sign blazed\
  \ across glass promised gelato and beckoned me closer. I ignored the call at first,\
  \ the prospect of flooding into the street hours later courtesy of bitter dark ales,\
  \ appealing. But, something gave me pause and I gave in.\n\nCrossing the street,\
  \ I pushed the heavy door and entered. Pink velvet walls, leather booths, and fake-smiling\
  \ staff, made my first steps into this saccharine sanctuary a culture shock. I stood\
  \ still for a moment, considering escape, when from behind the counter a voice asked,\
  \ \"Eating in or taking away?\" My tongue moved over words foreign to my ears, and\
  \ soon I found myself sitting, menu in hand, deciding on options. My roving eyes\
  \ chose and I placed the order \u2013 salted caramel gateaux, for better or worse.\
  \ Ironically, I'm not a fan of cake, and never have been. Sometimes though, intuition\
  \ overrules tradition.   \n\nAs it arrived at the table, sickening sweet smells\
  \ that usually turned my stomach, haunted my nostrils like old friends instead.\
  \ The first bite passed my lips, and my chest tightened, as the prospect of being\
  \ alone in this new country took hold. Tears threatened collapse of my whip cream\
  \ dome, but I ate on, morsels forced into a stomach wanting to reject every crumb.\
  \ \n\nYet as I sat there, alone in my misery, looking out at the world, another\
  \ feeling began to take over. I watched couples holding hands on their way to parties\
  \ and taverns, took in the boisterous laughter of a group of rowdy twenty-somethings\
  \ peacocking past, and considered the merits of joining singing drunkards with no\
  \ fucks to give. \n\nMy lips twitched.\n\nA smile found the corners of my mouth,\
  \ and I swallowed each bite with more purpose. Comforting waves of peace flowed\
  \ through me, and for the first time in days, I didn't feel as if the world was\
  \ ending. \n\nSo, while this isn't my story of being lost in Barbados' gullies.\
  \ Nor is it the one of soaking in the Mediterranean along Spain's coast for the\
  \ first time. This is my story of my first steps to overcoming a pain I thought\
  \ would never be quenched. It is how I found comfort in for me, the oddest of places.\
  \ \n\nAnd now, I think I'll have another piece of cake."
