Text: "It was dark when we arrived, our senses exhausted after having engaged with\
  \ desert mountainous beauty since sunrise. It was a few days after the road from\
  \ Keylong to Ley had opened and we were fortunate enough to witness the transition\
  \ from full snow-cover. The flowers were yet to come I was told, but those things\
  \ we did get to experience; the half-frozen streams, snowfall and swirling winds\
  \ on Taglang La pass at 17,480 ft as well as the rainbow of earthly tones and unforgettable\
  \ textures seen on the inclines at lower altitudes were spectacular. It was definitely\
  \ worth the bumpy ride in a public bus that was driven with masterful technique,\
  \ the winding road travel broken up by brief stops in small villages along the way\
  \ for a comfort break and a plate of delicious lentils and rice or ladakhi kulcha.\
  \ \n\nIt was amazing to think that those communities were completely snowed in for\
  \ most of the year, relying largely on preserved foods. The bus driver too recounted\
  \ that water shortages were common and there were communities that relied on passers\
  \ by dropping bottles on the road. I was told the story of the ghost of Gata Loops\
  \ on that bus trip too, kindly translated for me by Veenut, a fellow sole woman\
  \ traveler I had met and become fast friends with a 5 am that morning. It was the\
  \ story of a man who had died of dehydration there and was said to haunt the road.\
  \ A small temple had been constructed and a pile of water bottles lay unopened,\
  \ left there as offerings. Whether or not there was a supernatural being lurking\
  \ there, I declined on leaving a bottle as I was more concerned about what all that\
  \ plastic would do to the earth. \n\nAs my new travel companion and I got down in\
  \ Ley, having watched the sun disappear over the low-lying buildings and stupas\
  \ I almost succumbed to a tout, but Veenut knew better and quickly ushered me off.\
  \ We got in a cab to an eco lodge a few kilometers from the main town and arrived\
  \ to discovered simple accommodation powered by the sun where all was recycled.\
  \ \n\nThe next day, we made our way to a co-op selling local goods, purchasing dried\
  \ apricots, apple, almonds and tangy sea buckthorn juice. A collection truck went\
  \ by and as the sound of the megaphone blasted, I caught sight of a poster down\
  \ the road that said \u2018Keep Ley clean\u2019. I came to know that since the blockbuster\
  \ film \u20183 Idiots\u2019 came out in 2009, domestic tourism had skyrocketed there,\
  \ to the point that Ley was choking on garbage. With the yearly influx of tourists,\
  \ especially in the few months when the roads were open, there simply were no systems\
  \ in place to manage the extra waste.\n\nAs we travelled in the coming days to nearby\
  \ places, the contradictions were confounding. The intense experiences of all that\
  \ the natural world had to offer, such as the rugged landscapes splattered with\
  \ yaks and Kashmiri goats, and the cool sensation as we reached down to touch the\
  \ water where the Zanskar meets the Indus river, were in stark contrast to the periodic\
  \ deposits of garbage. They could be seen dispersed across the landscape, more concentrated\
  \ in the areas that were higher in tourists. One of the places in which this was\
  \ most visible was the Nubra Valley, where people rode tired-looking two-humped\
  \ camels with a backdrop of these colourful piles of garbage, nestled in the sand\
  \ dunes. \n\nWhile effective elimination of garbage beyond \u2018out of sight, out\
  \ of mind\u2019 is a global challenge, I certainly became aware of my imprint in\
  \ a place where the balance was delicate, nature was so powerful yet vulnerable\
  \ and not completely captured and controlled by human intervention. I know that\
  \ any greater aspirational changes have to  begin with myself, and in this case,\
  \ it was carrying my rubbish with me that could not be recycled locally. I hope\
  \ that tourists, especially those travelling in sensitive ecosystems, become increasingly\
  \ aware of such issues and that innovative technologies can play a role in protecting\
  \ these places that need us on their side."
