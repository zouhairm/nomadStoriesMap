Text: "Summer Camp. 1971. Bayport, New York. My life for the next 30 days is perfectly\
  \ sandwiched into one small duffle. My best friend is by my side. We arrive at the\
  \ meeting point to board the bus and people from all different places are swarming\
  \ around us. The buzz of excitement mixed with anticipation is swirling through\
  \ the air. The alumni are greeting each other, laughing and hugging. The excitement\
  \ is contagious but at the same time we are hesitant. Will they like us? Will we\
  \ like them? Thirty days with strangers morning, noon and night?!  Fast Forward\
  \ to today. Lebanon Mountain Trail (LMT) Spring Thru-hike. 2018. Beirut, Lebanon.\
  \ My best friend, my love, habibi, is by my side and we have the same feeling we\
  \ did as kids off to summer camp. \n\nWe had been planning to join the LMT 30 day\
  \ hike since hiking some of the trails with friends in the summer of 2017. Gaby\
  \ grew up in Lebanon but left due to the war when he was 14. This hike would provide\
  \ the opportunity for us to explore his country from south to north, learning about\
  \ the mountain villages, local food and culture. We are very active hikers but never\
  \ did more than 3 days in a row so we increased our hiking distance and work outs\
  \ to physically prepare. We had not spent time in communal travel since we were\
  \ kids but this you really can\u2019t prepare for. \n\nThe first four days were\
  \ the hardest, mentally and physically. It was hot and our feet were achy. We were\
  \ adjusting to the daily routine of communal meals, hiking and sleeping. But none\
  \ of that really mattered because from day one, it was magical! The guides and co-hikers\
  \ immediately felt like family. The hosts of the guest houses were kind and generous,\
  \ opening their homes and their lives to us. The food, oh the food, fresh, local,\
  \ and abundant. The landscapes, views, flora and fauna, changed day to day providing\
  \ picture perfect photo opportunities day after day. We were a diverse group of\
  \ hikers from many countries, ages, backgrounds, which filled our days and nights\
  \ with engaging conversations. And best of all, we loved to have fun, on and off\
  \ the trail. Where else can 20 grown adults hike 22 km, share a home cooked meal\
  \ then unabashedly dance to Dalida with disco lights, sing Bandolero at the top\
  \ of our lungs, make hand puppets in the shadows, play musical chairs then hug and\
  \ kiss each other goodnight before heading off to bed to start it again the next\
  \ day. If I had to sum up this Lebanese experience in one word, it would be genuine.\
  \ \n\nSo, did we survive \u201Csummer camp\u201D? Just as when we were kids, we\
  \ reluctantly left after thirty days with amazing stories and memories of physical\
  \ achievements, adventures, dancing, singing, games, bellies full of fresh local\
  \ food but most of all new lifelong friends that touched our hearts who we will\
  \ never forget."
