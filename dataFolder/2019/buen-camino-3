Text: "\u201C\xA1Buen camino!\u201D \u201CHave a good Way!\u201D Before embarking\
  \ on one of the routes of Camino de Santiago I considered this uttering a simple\
  \ turn of phrase, polite, but distant and a touch impersonal, something Spaniards\
  \ might tell the neighbors they had seen once in their life if the said neighbors\
  \ shared their plans to go to Santiago de Compostela. I saw no reason why wishing\
  \ somebody \u201Ca good Way\u201D should relate to my future experiences. I imagined\
  \ that occasionally I would greet and be greeted by this phrase by other people\
  \ along the road. I didn't expect it to become the catchphrase and the essence of\
  \ my whole journey.\nThe Piligrimage by Paulo Coelho turned Camino de Santiago or\
  \ the Way of Saint James into one of the most popular pilgrimage routes in Europe.\
  \ Yet I had always been more fond history than philosophy or mysticism. I wanted\
  \ to walk down a part of the Portuguese route as my family had lived in that region\
  \ a long time ago. This journey seemed a way of reconnecting myself with a part\
  \ of my heritage that got lost during the flow of time, walking along the same streets\
  \ that might have been used by my ancestors and visiting the same historical sights.\
  \ I ended up getting more than I signed up for, and it was a good way indeed.\n\
  It was a good way not just because of the scenery that I wanted to see so badly\
  \ that I started on that journey. I did love the gray chiselly lanes surrounded\
  \ by fresh greenery, the towering trees that provided a much needed respite from\
  \ the broiling sunshine at midday, the tiny splashing waterfalls that resulted from\
  \ the heavy rains the previous weeks, the crumbling ruins of some old buildings\
  \ and the seemingly endless grazing lands and vineyards. I enjoyed the sweat smell\
  \ of fresh flowers many of which, as an urban dweller, I had never encountered before,\
  \ and the unusual taste of local home-made food that was particularly delicious\
  \ after a long exhausting hike, and the semi-constant sounds of wildlife that I\
  \ came to associate with peace.\nHowever, it was the attitude of people that stole\
  \ my heart.\n\u201C\xA1Bon Cami\xF1o!\u201D cheered a booking clerk, a vivacious\
  \ curly-haired woman with distinct Galician accent, when she came to see my companion\
  \ and myself off at the bus station. The day before she had sold us the tickets\
  \ to our starting point and seemed as excited as if she was bidding goodbye to her\
  \ friends before the vacation of their lives instead of virtual strangers. \n\u201C\
  Bom caminho!\u201D we heard stepping on the bridge linking Portugal and Spain. A\
  \ group of cyclists in matching uniforms shouted this greeting and waved as they\
  \ flashed past us in the direction of Valen\xE7a do Minho while we continued on\
  \ our way to Tui.\n\u201C\xA1Buen camino!\u201D was the phrase we exchanged with\
  \ every pilgrim along the way. It was the phrase that local people greeted us when\
  \ we walked past their houses. It was the phrase I considered  an exquisite taunt\
  \ during the third day on the road feeling a distinct ache from all the callouses\
  \ and overworked muscles. It became the phrase I later came to associate with heart-felt\
  \ encouragement to continue because everyone might need reassurance that the pain\
  \ would get better and your aim got closer with every step, no matter whether it\
  \ was a physical destination of Santiago de Compostela, or a spiritual one. The\
  \ road made everyone equal. \nI did get my reconnection with the past, though not\
  \ the way I had expected \u2013 not through the nature, or the buildings and cultural\
  \ sights, but through people and this feeling of community that united everybody\
  \ who uttered this simple well-wish \u201C\xA1Buen camino!\u201D"
