Text: "As we are sitting across from each other in small, red plastic chairs I take\
  \ a second helping of the corn-based dish that sat before us on a table brimming\
  \ with local delicacies. While enjoying the flavor bursts of the fresh herbs and\
  \ hints of chile, I noticed there were also bits of something chewy in the mix but\
  \ didn\u2019t give it a second thought. Johnny C\u2019est La Vie obviously wasn\u2019\
  t his real name but it was his online moniker (we were introduced on Facebook through\
  \ a mutual friend) and the one he used as a tour guide in Ho Chi Minh City, as it\
  \ was easy for Westerners to pronounce and had a celebratory swagger to it. \n\n\
  It was my second day in Ho Chi Minh City and in Vietnam as a whole. As my trip progressed\
  \ from this afternoon and I traveled city to city, I spent time with a handful of\
  \ different men (females were not an option) I had hired to take me on various excursions\
  \ via scooter & motorcycle. It wasn\u2019t until meeting the others that I came\
  \ to see how progressive Johnny was in a country that views women in a very different\
  \ sort of light than I was accustomed to. Little did I know what a genuine, fresh\
  \ breath of air Johnny would turn out to be in comparison to the other local guides\
  \ I would encounter on this month-long solo adventure. Half-way into the trip, I\
  \ started telling anyone that inquired that my (non-existent) boyfriend was not\
  \ able to come with me due to his work schedule. It was easier than trying to explain\
  \ why I chose to travel alone and why I didn\u2019t want to get married. \n\nHaving\
  \ not yet experienced the slight grimaces I would receive from the other local guides\
  \ when I would order a FIRST beer with a meal, Johnny\u2019s encouragement of ordering\
  \ a SECOND and THIRD beer didn\u2019t strike me as out of the ordinary. Nor did\
  \ his offer of cigarettes, and use of swear words and hilarious, graphic descriptions\
  \ as we swapped stories about our lives. \u201CShe was so surprised I have snake\
  \ and not mussel,\u201D he said while describing his mother\u2019s surprise that\
  \ he was not born female. I had no idea at the time, how I would look back on this\
  \ afternoon with a bit of awe and with an even more extensive sense of gratitude\
  \ than that I had felt in the moment. \n \nThe morning had been an emotional rollercoaster,\
  \ exploring the doom and Agent Orange babies of the War Remnants Museum, then navigating\
  \ the chaos of the massive Ben Thanh Market. When it was finally time for lunch\
  \ we pulled up to a tiny roadside restaurant with exclusively-outdoor seating. I\
  \ hopped off the back of the scooter and Johnny asked me what I would like to eat.\
  \ Not being the open-minded eater that I am today, I took one look at an aquarium\
  \ full of snails and another one full of frogs, and confidently said, \u201CAnything\
  \ but the snails and frogs.\u201D A little back-and-forth banter later, we compromised\
  \ that we would order the frog but I held fast to my decision about the snails,\
  \ deep-rooted from a ridiculously irrational fear I harbored since I was a child.\
  \ \n\nAs the neighbor\u2019s chickens pecked around at our feet, plate after plate,\
  \ the food began to arrive. The frog, savory rice cakes topped with fresh herbs,\
  \ roasted pork, fresh shrimp spring rolls, and the mysterious corn dish crowded\
  \ the table. To the surprise of my unadventurous palate, the fried, lightly-breaded\
  \ frog was quite delicious and after washing down another mouthful of corn with\
  \ my third beer, Johnny asked me, \u201CYou like corn, yes?\u201D I looked up at\
  \ him, the impish grin spreading across his face gave it away in an instant. \u201C\
  There are snails in the corn aren\u2019t there?,\u201D I asked. Still grinning,\
  \ with a slight nod he indicated yes, and we both burst out laughing as I helped\
  \ myself to another spoonful and said, \u201CC\u2019est la vie, Johnny, C\u2019\
  est la vie.\u201D"
