Text: "People travel for the heck of it, to find themselves, to see places they have\
  \ never thought existed, or just to get away. Me? Well I travel because it\u2019\
  s the closest thing we have to time travel. I can go to a museum in the morning\
  \ and get lost in the findings of the past and spend my lunch in the busy local\
  \ tavern of the present surrounded by the people of the present and finally end\
  \ my night on top of a skyscraper viewing the advancements of the city and dreaming\
  \ of where the future may look like. \nTraveling to me is finding bits of moments\
  \ that one captures in a camera, frozen in megapixels, to save that fraction of\
  \ history to recall whenever I wish. Like the busy streets of Guanajuato, Mexico,\
  \ remembering the chill of the rain, the cheese stuck to my chin from the one pizza\
  \ place in the plaza, listening to the parade of musicians playing in the streets.\
  \ Or the sticky heat that would cling to your skin as you stepped out of the subways\
  \ in New York, making your way to the bagels factory, savoring the buns delicious\
  \ scent as you approached closer to the door. Or climbing out of the car after a\
  \ 6hr drive, you finally get a whiff of the freshest air so crisp and so clean &\
  \ sequoias tower above you feel like an ant looking up at flowers at Sequoia National\
  \ Park. \nAnd the best part is...there\u2019s an entire world out there just waiting\
  \ to be known. Each person a different perspective and the possibilities are endless!\
  \ I want to make my travels known to entice others to find their adventures."
