Text: "Despite the fact that we were the only African tourists on the trip into the\
  \ Sahara desert, my best friend and I were clearly more out of our comfort zone\
  \ than the rest of the tour.  \n\u201CWhat have you gotten us into?\u201D my friend\
  \ muttered to me as she pulled on yet another layer of clothing. \nOf course it\
  \ would be me, the plot hatcher who would book a 4-day journey into the desert,\
  \ at the beginning of the Moroccan Winter while sub-Saharan Africa enjoyed tropical\
  \ temperatures back home. \n\u201CIt\u2019s not my fault, I mixed up the hemispheres\u201D\
  \ \u2013 really it could happen to anyone, I tried to reassure myself as I wrapped\
  \ the silky pashmina around my nose and mouth. My previous experience, almost two\
  \ decades ago, in the Sahara was limited to a refrigerated shuttle, which twisted\
  \ its way through the streets of Cairo to Giza, sparing us from becoming deep-fried\
  \ falafels.  \n\nHow could I travel to al-Magrib al-Aqsa, the westernmost country\
  \ in the Arab world and not experience an Arabian night? Curiosity had me wondering\
  \ what the appeal was to witness a massive amount of sand. This is how I found myself;\
  \ enjoy the pitching motion of my camel companion. (Side note: I rode a dromedary\
  \ and was told to call them such, but who has time to launch into the faults in\
  \ categorizing a one-hump as two?)\n\nHow do I describe and quantify what I saw?\
  \ I passed dune upon dune of browns and gold and reds with an inexhaustible amount\
  \ still to come. Riding for a full day is not for the faint hearted, as my lack\
  \ of expertise of animals failed to understand how the beast beneath me could summit\
  \ towering dunes without a single miss step in the flowing sands. It was enchanting\
  \ to watch the grains snake and flow like an invisible river, guided by the wind.\
  \ It was slightly disconcerting to see the footprints of our Berber guide and our\
  \ hoard disappear after every step. We left no trace as we journeyed for hours,\
  \ and one couldn\u2019t help but wonder who had shared the same imperceptible steps\
  \ as I had. This was the majesty of the Sahara desert, one of the harshest regions\
  \ in the world, roughly the size of the United States. Something of this magnitude,\
  \ its formidable force had spanned millions of years in Earth\u2019s history.  \
  \ I was merely a guest in its den for a couple of nights; it was I - the unknown\
  \ entity - that would come and eventually go while the expanse endured on. \n\n\
  As we journeyed, the sun followed us from behind, overtook us and we scrambled up\
  \ the dunes to observe dusk settling into the sand. I could hear nothing, except\
  \ for a shy wind, which rustled past my ears. It was in that moment where shadows\
  \ took over, and the temperature descended that I was faced with the eerie stillness\
  \ of a vast wilderness. My breath no doubt escaped me in plumes of white, yet I\
  \ could not even see my travel companion just ahead of me. I had to trust that our\
  \ guide was navigating from experience and was in awe how he could follow obscure\
  \ paths \u2013 in the sand? Steered by the stars? I\u2019m not sure.       \n\n\
  I was left to my thoughts, at first clamorous then hushed to match the peace around\
  \ me. I registered finally, the mystery of the desert. I found solitude within the\
  \ sands that did not offer vulnerability but strength. This was the feeling I would\
  \ take with me as I made camp for the night, and settled in front of the fire while\
  \ the Berbers drums occupied the silence.  There was an awareness of being fully\
  \ disconnected by the sheer enormousness of the Sahara, which separated me civilization.\
  \ Living an imitation of the nomadic life forced me to reflect on the noise of my\
  \ day-to-day living, and recognized what would it mean to allow for a little more\
  \ soundlessness in my life."
