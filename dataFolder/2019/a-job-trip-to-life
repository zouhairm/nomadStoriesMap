Text: "The job offer came. Kuala Lumpur. Later on, Gulf Countries, possibly others\
  \ in SE Asia. Time was of the essence; they wanted her to start right away. She\
  \ had no job, no plans to pay for a Master's Degree that would burden her parents\
  \ economically and leave her jobless a year later. She was impatient.  Malaysia...\
  \ 'Let's check the map.' Yes, that is what most people do over there when it comes\
  \ up. She had never been interested in East Asia. She majored in Arabic, despite\
  \ Dad always having encouraged her to learn Chinese. 'But hey... it seems a great\
  \ opportunity, a chance to have funds in a place that was never even in your radar,\
  \ my friend,' she thought to herself. The decision made, she informed her family.\
  \ After all, it was just for three to six months. What was going to happen? It was\
  \ temporary, building experience to land a better job once she came back.\n\nWhen\
  \ she first found herself completely alone in downtown Kuching, surrounded by billboards\
  \ in Chinese, she was in shock. A band was singing 'An Alien in New York'. She was\
  \ that alien. They invited her to sit and enjoy the show. She had been looking for\
  \ them; she had actually seen the musicians playing a Spanish song a week earlier,\
  \ surrounded by friends that reminded her of her own. The clarinet invited her to\
  \ sit down next to his friend. In an unexpected turn of events, she had just entered\
  \ the most fateful show of her life in that small city in the other side of the\
  \ world. She did not know yet, but she had just made a crucial local connection,\
  \ one that would change her entire life.\n\nSeven years later, on the same day she\
  \ got her job offer...\n\n'Uhm, let's see what I have to do today. Oh, look at this,\
  \ writing contest... It's a short one. I should try; this is the year of 'YES'.\
  \ Now, she is sitting at her home-office desk in Borneo, procrastinating on her\
  \ to-do list. Choosing the theme for her story is tricky. She took a leap into the\
  \ unknown when she accepted that job back in 2012, to a land she hardly knew about,\
  \ thinking she would be back soon. She did not know she would quit her first job,\
  \ finding herself in the street with her luggage and nowhere to go. A hostel sheltered\
  \ her for a few days. A tip for the charitable: never offer a spare room if you\
  \ don't mean it, for you never know when a creep might try to break into the hostel\
  \ room of the person you offered it to, making her run for the hills. \n\nShe refused\
  \ to go back with a feeling of defeat, so she took an internship in her field. But\
  \ it did not pay the rent, so she changed jobs. She was clueless that, there, she\
  \ would survive her own #MeToo ordeal. Took another job, and lived in a succession\
  \ of hotel rooms and six apartments over the years, each with its own set of housemates,\
  \ including six illegal kitties at some point. That short story goes like this:\
  \ four women living on one salary, in one room, harboring a mum cat and her kittens\
  \ that would be kicked to the curb should the evil condo laws find out about them.\
  \ At least one of those women had stayed back on a tourist visa. Talk about migration,\
  \ law, and borders... \n\nYears later, she did not know how hard the transition\
  \ would be from temporary traveler to permanent migrant. The biggest leap she had\
  \ taken so far, into married life, entrepreneurship, and motherhood. But the unknown\
  \ also brought miscarriage. That is the one thing she did not expect to find in\
  \ her own personal journey. She did not even have nausea. No one had ever mentioned\
  \ how often it happens. Local connections proved essential to heal the wounds: her\
  \ friends and partners in activism raising their voices to change the world, her\
  \ circles making her feel at home, her Mak-in-law, her best ally.  She took a job\
  \ to find experience, she did not expect to find herself and her future."
