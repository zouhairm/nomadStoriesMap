Text: "Some may say that travelling through rural Rajasthan, where farm meets desert,\
  \ in peak hot season, may not be the greatest idea for the inexperienced traveller.\
  \ However, sometimes this sort of advice falls on deaf ears. It happened to be that\
  \ the tickets were booked, and I was determined to take on 45 degree days just for\
  \ a taste of something outside of my comfort zone, and you can bet that is what\
  \ I got. \n\nWhile some days were more focussed on meeting fellow travellers and\
  \ sharing a beer, other days I was determined to be more involved in the \u2018\
  real\u2019 experience of India. This led me to a conversation with a man named Loganathan.\
  \ We talked in-depth about the trials of local life, and the opportunities that\
  \ were present in these small towns. It was a really important conversation for\
  \ me; I think its easy to fall into the trap of being a privileged tourist feeling\
  \ guilty or empathetic for a foreign, \u2018poorer\u2019 way of life. Loganathan\
  \ not only made me question what I saw around me, but told me he wanted to show\
  \ me two places that might make me rethink my perceptions of rural India.\n\nThe\
  \ next day, I only a vague idea of the itinerary for our excursion. After a bumpy\
  \ ride in the back of a jeep, in what felt like the middle of nowhere, we pulled\
  \ up to the \u2018Barefoot College\u2019. I struggle to find words for how surreal\
  \ this was. We found a community of women who were so educated; engineers, midwives,\
  \ entrepreneurs and more, all gathered in this environment building solar panels,\
  \ generating profit through social enterprising and choreographing performances\
  \ with messages about equality and empowerment to stage in local neighbourhoods.\
  \ There were women from all around the world: Fiji, Sudan, Mexico and more. We were\
  \ welcomed with open arms to come and engage with them, learn from them, and be\
  \ challenged by them. It was one of the most outward displays of empathy, community\
  \ and empowerment that I have ever been privy to. \n\nAfter many a conversation\
  \ and a shared meal, we piled back into the jeep - it had been myself and 2 other\
  \ Aussie tourists on the trip - and headed off into the dusk. We kept driving as\
  \ the sun was setting, full of anticipation and admiration from the experience at\
  \ Barefoot College. The car stopped outside a large concrete building, and we could\
  \ hear the sound of children and something that sounded almost like a video game.\
  \ The brief: we were going to visit the \u2018Night School\u2019, where children\
  \ who couldn\u2019t attend school during the day for various reasons, came to learn\
  \ at night. Although we were in a neighbourhood where many family homes didn\u2019\
  t have any form of toilet or fresh water, walking into the school it became clear\
  \ where the video game sounds were coming from; an iPad that had been linked to\
  \ a projector. This night school, with two teachers aged 17 and 20, was being provided\
  \ with Apple products to facilitate the learning that was taking place. The divide\
  \ between the rich and the poor in India is frustratingly and maddeningly clear,\
  \ but in this disadvantaged neighbourhood, there was an awareness of the importance\
  \ of these children being computer literate. As one girl who could have only been\
  \ 5 or 6 stood and drew the letters A and B on some learning app, we stood there\
  \ almost dumbfounded as we realised that we would never have even thought about\
  \ the clear importance of these children being taught IT skills here. \n\nTo say\
  \ that I was really put in my place by the time we got back to our accomodation\
  \ would be an understatement. I had truly seen a different side to a world that\
  \ I had considered to be disadvantaged, and without much hope for change. It is\
  \ one thing to travel to a place and see the things you want to see, and interpret\
  \ them in the way that your background and preconceptions enable you to, but its\
  \ another thing to question this and then grow. You have to step back and see past\
  \ the tip of the iceberg."
