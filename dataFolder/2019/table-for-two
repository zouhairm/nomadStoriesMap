Text: "Gurgle.\n\nMy stomach groaned as I pushed through the stagnant swarm of people.\n\
  \nHungry travelers filled the restaurants inside Incheon International Airport,\
  \ with more crowding the fourth floor in hopes of getting lunch before their flight.\
  \ \n\nEven the vending machine had a wait \u2013 perhaps to be expected considering\
  \ the constant activity in the thriving city of Seoul.\n\nWith everywhere packed,\
  \ I settled on a place called Myungga's Garden. My stomach growled again in protest\
  \ of the dozen others I stood behind.\n\nAnd as I inched closer, it continued in\
  \ anticipation.\n\nStep.\n\nGurgle.\n\nStep.\n\nGurgle.\n\nStep, and \u2013 finally!\n\
  \nThere was only one person ahead of me now. The mix of ginger and garlic wafted\
  \ through the air, and I was salivating at the thought of being next.\n\nThe hostess\
  \ returned from circling the mere living-room-sized eatery, muttering something\
  \ in Korean to the woman before me. Looking back at me, she gave a sheepish grin\
  \ then nodded in response to whatever the question was. Then the hostess turned\
  \ to face me.\n\n\u201CYou two can sit together, yes?\u201D She asked.\n\nI could\
  \ feel the introvert in me panicking. \n\nAs a solo traveler, I\u2019ve come to\
  \ relish the comfort of spending time, especially meals, alone. The thought of dining\
  \ with a complete stranger sounded daunting, and my limited knowledge of the Korean\
  \ language only made the thought more intimidating.\n\n\u201CUh\u2026\u201D I stuttered\
  \ before my stomach interrupted with a loud grumble, as if deciding for me. \n\n\
  The hostess pointed towards the only free two-person table nestled in the middle\
  \ of the restaurant.\n\nA waiter arrived within seconds, carefully centering the\
  \ table with a full pitcher of water and two cups he had balanced on one of three\
  \ trays. The woman asked about something on the menu, and the waiter returned to\
  \ the kitchen, leaving us in silence. Too scared of my own mispronunciation to engage\
  \ in conversation, I just sat stiffly in my seat. \n\nShe appeared to be in her\
  \ late 40s, though it was hard to tell. With a crease-free complexion, the only\
  \ sign of aging was the few gray hair sprouting throughout her otherwise jet-black\
  \ locks loosely hanging in a single braid. Her porcelain complexion radiated the\
  \ grace of someone who\u2019s lived without the constant weight of worry.\n\nThe\
  \ waiter returned with a plate of bulgogi beef lettuce boats drizzled in a thick\
  \ brown sauce and organized in a star formation. The savory smell made my stomach\
  \ grumble, somehow louder than before.\n\nShe laughed, generously motioning a hand\
  \ towards the plate. \n\nNormally, I would\u2019ve timidly declined \u2013 but once\
  \ again, my hunger silenced my shyness.\n\nOur waiter returned, pulling a pen and\
  \ notepad from his apron\u2019s front pocket. I had been so unnecessarily nervous\
  \ about the whole dining-with-a-stranger situation that I forgot about the menu.\
  \ Flipping to the middle, I pointed at the first thing I saw. \n\nBibimbap \u2013\
  \ a dish with meat, various vegetables and a fried egg on top. I had no idea what\
  \ bibimbap was beyond the picture, but it looked good. And at this point, I think\
  \ I\u2019d be happy with anything edible set in front of me.\n\nThe woman grinned\
  \ while holding up two fingers to ask for the same. The waiter scribbled our orders\
  \ before pivoting back towards the kitchen.\n\nNo more than 15 minutes later, he\
  \ returned balancing two basketball-sized bowls of bibimbap. Strips of seared steak,\
  \ saut\xE9ed shiitake mushrooms, a tangle of bean sprouts, thinly sliced carrots\
  \ and zucchini covered a layer of steamed rice. Crowned with a sunny-side fried\
  \ egg and sprinkled with toasted sesame seeds, the sight alone was enough to make\
  \ my mouth water. \n\nThe woman handed me a set of silver chopsticks. Forgoing the\
  \ comfortable choice, I traded my familiar fork for her offer.\n\n\u201CBon app\xE9\
  tit,\u201D she said, raising her glass for a toast.\n\nWith chopsticks in one hand\
  \ and cup in the other, I lifted mine to meet hers.\n\n\u201CBon app\xE9tit!\u201D\
  \n\nWe finished our meal in silent serenity \u2013 the kind I mistook as coming\
  \ only from solitude, up until now.\n\nBefore leaving, I wished her a safe flight\
  \ in Korean (or at least the best I could with Google Translate\u2019s guidance).\n\
  \nShe smiled and bowed, bidding me a farewell in English."
