Text: "My travel story. It will sound like your typical, moved to another country\
  \ to work story, but it isn't. For me it was a life changer. A deal maker and a\
  \ deal breaker. \n\nI heard of a job opening as an interpreter in Istanbul,  applied,\
  \ got it, and had moved to the unknown within a week. You might say it was a leap\
  \ of faith.\n\nNot knowing anything about Istanbul I was a bit intimidated at first.\
  \ \n\nMy first day there I checked into my hotel and went for a walk on the infamous\
  \ Istiklal street. You would say I must have had some sense of \"culture shock\"\
  \ but I didn't. It felt like home from the second I stepped onto that street.\n\
  That day led to 10 years of living in Istanbul. I would say that those 10 years\
  \ shaped my personality and my view of life.\n\nComing from a Lebanese family that\
  \ was very tight knit and protective, to live on my own for the first time was all\
  \ too bitter and sweet.\n\nI would say the sweet part of Istanbul was the people\
  \ I met. As cliche as that might sound. My previous fiance made my stay feel like\
  \ home. The friends I made gave me memories I will never forget.  The work I did\
  \ opened up my eyes to so many things in life. It made me shift my priorities drastically.\
  \ \n\nHaving worked with refugees who were seeking to begin a new life In the US\
  \ I learned how fragile and precious our lives are. I learned compassion from the\
  \ various people I met. People who were fleeing their countries, hoping for a better\
  \ future for themselves and their families. They taught me a lot these people. I\
  \ don't believe I can even sum it up into words. \n\nAnd that's my story. The story\
  \ that shaped my life."
