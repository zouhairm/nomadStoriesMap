Text: "Tokyo,Japan. It's 4 am in the morning and I'm sweating like I've never sweated\
  \ before. Nobody had told me summer weather was going to be so hot and humid - but\
  \ hey, part of the reason might also be that I'm at \"El cafe Latino\", a salsa\
  \ club in Roppongi, and I've been dancing for hours, literally. \nA guy approaches\
  \ me, he looks very Japanese - but still he has something different. We dance together\
  \ the whole night, one of those casual acquaintances you spend some time with and\
  \ that's it. He offers me some beers and I feel so confident I insist on saying\
  \ that Corona is an Italian brand. It's not. At all. But who cares.\n\nTokyo,Japan.\
  \ It's 4 am in the morning and I'm going out with some friends. We are near Shibuya\
  \ crossing... oh if you haven't been there before, go. Now. The crowd, the noise,\
  \ the images, it's like in the movies, but better. And all of a sudden. Him. The\
  \ Corona guy. I'm not shy and I scream \"YUUUUUUUUKI\". He turns and boom. He recognizes\
  \ me: \"ALESSIAAAAAAAAAAA\" (He still can't pronounce my name correctly - I notice).\
  \ We run towards each other, time goes a little slower for a moment. \n\nGuys, finding\
  \ that exact person in the middle of a 10000000000 people crowd is not fortuity.\
  \ It's destiny. \nBut this is only the beginning of my story with Yuki..."
