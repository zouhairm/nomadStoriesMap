Text: "The magic Kingdom of Morocco wasn\u2019t a real Eastern folk tale for me. I\u2019\
  d rather say it was a funny parody on a tale by the brothers Grimm. \nI found myself\
  \ there almost by accident, being a volunteer escaping Moscow during FIFA World\
  \ Cup.\nThroughout the whole travel, Morocco played with me the game \"Never have\
  \ I ever\u2026\u201D \nSo let the game begin!\nMy first impression of Casablanca\
  \ was expressed through disappointed \"Well\u2026?\" I didn\u2019t notice the charm\
  \ of the famous film or the popular song. I couldn\u2019t suspect that this bizarre\
  \ country had such a generous heart.\nI appreciated the hospitality of the locals\
  \ when some guys in the streets asked to marry them. Unfortunately this hospitality\
  \ didn\u2019t extend to the traffic \u2013 brazen drivers didn\u2019t let cross\
  \ the street even at the light.\nMorocco continued to show its mischievous temperament\
  \ in the Sahara. The romantic atmosphere of the starry sky was irrevocably spoiled\
  \ by a sudden appearance of a scorpion. In panic and terror I felt a strong punch\
  \ fall on my head. Never have I ever\u2026 been beaten by Genies. This was an achievement\
  \ I could definitely boast about.\nNever have I ever ... been at a music concert.\
  \ The Gnawa festival in Essaouira became the starting point for my love for the\
  \ rock band Hoba Hoba Spirit who performed the first day. Ironically, that day was\
  \ the only one when we hadn\u2019t been burned on the beach yet.\nNever have I ever...\
  \ Hidden my documents and money in underwear. It was 4 a.m. with my luggage in Casablanca\
  \ preparing to go to another city in the North.\nInternational Tangier met me, opening\
  \ its cordial embrace from the Mediterranean to the Atlantic. Here men didn\u2019\
  t try to pick me up so actively, prices didn\u2019t pry my last 100 euros out so\
  \ rapidly and drivers didn\u2019t try to kill me on the roads. Everything seemed\
  \ brighter and more diverse due to the mix of European and Oriental cultures.\n\"\
  Here you go\" \u2013 Morocco whispered sneaky sending a thief for my phone. Guess\
  \ who visited the police more than her volunteer project? Viva Tangier, one of the\
  \ safest cities in Morocco! Even criminal Casablanca didn\u2019t do such a dirty\
  \ trick to me.\nThe last days in Tangier were marked by the visit to the picturesque\
  \ Herculean caves and my picturesquely bleeding foot injured there.\nThe next journey,\
  \ the one to the Blue Pearl of Morocco, which began in a crazy way, couldn\u2019\
  t be normal in general. A stranger without pictures on Facebook suggests giving\
  \ you a ride? Why not! Oddly enough, he turned out to be a good man, so I reached\
  \ Chefchaouen in safe.\nBy that time, my 100 Euros had disappeared. It didn\u2019\
  t upset me, so my carelessness led me to Akchour. There, in mountainous \u201Cnowhere\u201D\
  \ with icy waterfalls, I spent time in heart-to-heart conversations with a local\
  \ school teacher. \nUpon return to the town, a lonely night waited for me on the\
  \ square. At night empty Chefchaouen looked like a play town full of jacks-in-the-box.\
  \ Two young Moroccans saved me from troubles, guarding me till the dawn. It was\
  \ an incredible dawn that we met on a hill overlooking the town and discussing various\
  \ philosophical topics.\nNever have I ever... Hitchhiked. Hitchhiking with a heavy\
  \ bag, a discharged phone and no plan wasn\u2019t a good idea. Especially when the\
  \ trip lasted at least five hours and you realized that you would arrive only by\
  \ night.\nThe motto \"Stupidity and bravery\" reached its apogee when I got into\
  \ the car with four strangers. While I was hiding my manicure scissors and trying\
  \ to memorize their distinctive features, they brought me to their families, comforted\
  \ me and found transport to Fes. There was another unplanned meeting waited for\
  \ me. A stranger, having seen me frightened and alone, came to the aid \u2013 she\
  \ was ready to give me everything she had.\nI wish I could be back... to walk across\
  \ dangerous areas in Casablanca, to get lost in Old Medina, to swim on the border\
  \ of the Mediterranean and the Atlantic, to dance to Berber music...  But most of\
  \ all I\u2019d like to regain faith in mankind over and over again."
