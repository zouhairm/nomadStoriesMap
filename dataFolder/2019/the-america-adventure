Text: "So three months ago this whole current experience was unknown. Let\u2019s rewind\
  \ from the present and go back in time to when it all began so you can fully understand.\n\
  \nThe date is the 31 October 2018, the time is 5:20 pm. It\u2019s time for local\
  \ South African Gareth to leave his home to start his new job in Sunny Florida in\
  \ the country of dreams, the USA. After a long flight together with many intense\
  \ security checks and stamped boarding passes. Gareth finally arrives in America.\n\
  \nThe Date now is the 1 November 2018, the time is 6:30 am.  Now it\u2019s time\
  \ for Gareth to start his first official day.  From having to learn to carry food\
  \ on large black oval trays to adapting to high country class standards like serving\
  \ drinks on the right and food on the left hand side as well as the different foods\
  \ offered like Salmon and the Beets, Berry\u2019s and Farro Salad.  \nFrom that\
  \ day forth the Hospitality Country Club life had officially begun.\n\nFast forwarding\
  \ to the present.\nAfter many double shifts later. Gareth now is a changed man.\
  \ He now knows world class hospitality standards, different types of foods and even\
  \ large tray carrying skills. \n\nThe moral of the story. Never be afraid to try\
  \ something new. If Gareth never left his home he\u2019s always known he would not\
  \ know what he knows now. So the question is are you ready to change your unknown\
  \ to a known experience? \nTake the leap, your adventure too is waiting to be discovered."
