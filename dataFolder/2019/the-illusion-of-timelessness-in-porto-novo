Text: "Porto Novo is a typical tasca down the street from where I live in Bonfim,\
  \ one of the oldest districts of Porto. The irony of its name is surely unintentional\
  \ and was only earned with the passage of time. Novo can be translated as either\
  \ young or new. Now I love this place, but there is nothing new or young about it.\
  \ Few things in the establishment, besides the n\xE3o fumadores sign, appear to\
  \ have been installed post-Salazar, and this includes the staff. Every time I pop\
  \ in for a lunch special, there\u2019s a slight sense of displacement, as if I\u2019\
  ve stepped into another reality. Time passes differently here.\n\nThe man behind\
  \ the counter that I always refer to as the turtle (slightly hunched back, extra\
  \ slow movements, typically sweatered) remarked, when I mentioned my Uruguayan heritage,\
  \ that he remembers the upset of the 1950 World Cup. He was exactly ten years old\
  \ at the time. Novo, he was not. Yet, without a doubt, he was a true gentleman,\
  \ who always made sure to wave to you in his slow, kindly way and ask how you were\
  \ doing, usually with a handshake for extra measure. \n\nHe wasn\u2019t the one\
  \ who normally served me though. That was O Senhor, always ready with quick steps\
  \ and firm movements. Buttoned-down polyester short sleeve tucked into grey slacks,\
  \ comfortable black shoes, receded grey hair waxed back. I can\u2019t help chuckling\
  \ to myself when recalling this one time when he was clearing what was left from\
  \ the previous customer, pulled up a wine glass in one swift motion, and noticed\
  \ that a perfect circle was left in the paper tablecloth. He was surprised and let\
  \ out an emphatic, \u201COoooooo!\u201D. Still enjoying the simple pleasures of\
  \ the job. \n\nPanado com batatas fritas e salada (breaded cutlet with fries and\
  \ salad) was a standard dish served by O Senhor. Always available no matter what\
  \ the dishes of the day were. Pure comfort food. Similar to what Uruguayans (and\
  \ Italians, I believe) call milanesa. The only difference in this case being the\
  \ substitution of beef for pork. This was one of the most common meals in my home\
  \ growing up and I felt a piece of nostalgic warmth with each bite.\n\nOne day,\
  \ as the panados and vinho tinto were churning their way through my belly, I lost\
  \ myself in reflection, looking around at the walls, the floors, the chairs. (\u201C\
  Her clothes are old, but never are they dirty.\u201D) Faded plastic signs in ketchup\
  \ red and mustard yellow bluntly labelling what\u2019s available: CACHORRO FRANCESINHA\
  \ PRESUNTO. Standard Porto snacks. Since when? These walls, these floors, those\
  \ little signs haven\u2019t changed for decades. All these regular customers must\
  \ feel a sense of timelessness when they pass through that flimsy glass, aluminum-lined\
  \ door. The same fridge filled with sobremesas greets them with sweet possibilities,\
  \ murmuring its electric hum. The same step and metal handrail to get up to the\
  \ bar to order a frothy fino.\n\nI imagine the asthmatic man propped up against\
  \ the wall at his solitary table feels a solidness in Porto Novo. As his health\
  \ declines and strength crumbles away, this caf\xE9 is nearly the same as it was\
  \ in his youth. I\u2019m now in that stage of youth, in my prime like the gentlemanly\
  \ turtle during Salazar, yet down that same mortal path I go whether I pause to\
  \ consider it or not. This is why the illusion of timelessness is so comforting.\
  \ It seems to expose the lie of our own mortality. Today will be like tomorrow and\
  \ nothing will change\u2026ever. And so, each patron snuggles into this warm, woolen\
  \ cloak of timelessness as they sip and chew, laugh and go ooooo! But, there\u2019\
  s no halting the march of time. The walls chip and the paint fades, as the door\
  \ endlessly swings open and closed, its rattle a bit louder with each passing day.\
  \ \n\nSo, we shoulder the load, ignore the future, plaster and paint the wall\u2026\
  we beat on, boats against the current, borne back ceaselessly into the present,\
  \ or propelled into the future, as the case may be.\n\nPorto Novo will always remain\
  \ novo in my heart. However old it gets. However old I get."
