Text: "I smiled as I watched the little girls clad in their blue Ankara skirts and\
  \ white tops with blue ribbons on their hair and with white shoes to match; clutching\
  \ their small handbags and hand fans, while laughing loudly as they walked down\
  \ the road. The laughter and loud banter brought back sweet childhood memories.\
  \ The dusty road and the fiery wind were no match for my wandering eyes. I bowed\
  \ my head and struggled to hold down my skirt with my left hand while clutching\
  \ my handbag, with my right hand firmly on my head to hold my scarf. A dangerous\
  \ journey, yes; but its Ndana\u2019s birthday celebration and I must attend. It\
  \ was getting dark and my body was showing signs of tiredness; I stopped over at\
  \ Kura, a local restaurant situated at the outskirts of the village beside a large\
  \ palm oil plantation to ask for directions. Finding directions to Ndana\u2019s\
  \ house was beginning to seem more daunting than I initially thought. There he was,\
  \ seated at the far left end of the restaurant reading a book with an ear piece.\
  \ I walked up to him and try to ask him for directions. He looked at me irritatingly\
  \ from head to toe before without saying a word. I looked around before I said in\
  \ a loud voice \u201CAna m acho ulo Ndana!\u201D He was silent and continued reading.\
  \ I knocked gently on the table and waited for him to say something. \u201CSpeak\
  \ English, I can\u2019t speak Igbo,\u201D he said as he put his book down and removed\
  \ his ear piece. I grab a chair and sit opposite him, looking into his eyes. Ignoring\
  \ his rumpled navy blue shirt and thick bushy afro hair; I couldn\u2019t help but\
  \ stare at his red lips, and brown eyes that seemed so lost yet innocent. For a\
  \ second I forgot I was tired and was there to ask for directions; I just wanted\
  \ to close my eyes and kiss those lips. When I finally got to speak, I asked him\
  \ if could show me the directions to Ndana\u2019s house in English. He smiled and\
  \ asked me to follow him. This stranger whom I have never met until I walked into\
  \ Kura was already making my heart beat fast and asking me to follow him even though\
  \ I was not sure if he knew Ndana\u2019s house or not. The bar man watched us as\
  \ we left the restaurant. His intense gaze startled me a bit but I felt it was a\
  \ ting of jealousy perhaps. I followed him, and we started walking through a deserted\
  \ narrow path. At a point, I was petrified but he encouraged me to continue that\
  \ it was few miles left. Few hours later, we stopped in front of a thatched hut\
  \ with only two huts built beside it. While we stood in front of the hut, I heard\
  \ quick footsteps in the hut. Ndana ran out from the hut, tying brown wrapper and\
  \ wearing blue bathroom slippers on her feet. She looked a bit taken aback when\
  \ she saw me and reluctantly, she hugged me while smiling at him. I knew that smile,\
  \ the one that quietly said \u201Cyou did not call me before coming.\u201D Still\
  \ smiling, Ndana took my left hand and tried to whisper into my left ear but I quickly\
  \ withdrew my hand, and feigned a smile. She cast a quick glance at him before looking\
  \ into my eyes. Nervous, I walked few steps away from her before taking my phone\
  \ from my handbag to make a call. I was visibly shaken as I raised the phone to\
  \ my ear. That call was the longest call of my life."
