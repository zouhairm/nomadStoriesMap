Text: "A magical traveling story started during my arrival in Morocco. I was seeking\
  \ to experience adventures entailed of humbleness, inspiring, and colorful. What\
  \ made my experience so enriching were the Moroccans that allowed me in their home\
  \ and welcomed me as a friend. I volunteered as an English teacher where I had the\
  \ opportunity to learn from the Moroccan hospitality, to work with Europeans in\
  \ a foreign country, and be inspired by curious students. My morning routine consisted\
  \ of waking up at the teacher\u2019s apartment, then using the hole in the floor,\
  \ then eating some bread with French cheese (le vache qui rit) with some yogurt,\
  \ and then walking to school while trying to come up with a lesson in my head. Although\
  \ simple, it was my way of trying to explore the culture; just taking a photo of\
  \ the famous statues would just make me become a stamp collector rather than storyteller.\
  \ Even this simple routine made me learn to enjoy people-watching, taking my time,\
  \ and laughing at every simple joke. I didn\u2019t learn this myself, but through\
  \ interacting with the locals. Each person in Morocco that I met had taught me something.\
  \ Each person was their own storyteller. Each person had something to add to in\
  \ my unknown journey. I learned what gratitude meant that whenever someone only\
  \ had $1, I would get back $10. I didn\u2019t learn these lessons through ease,\
  \ but to accept everything while traveling: to accept a bad one in order to experience\
  \ a good one. Anthony Bourdain said it well, \u201C\"I\u2019m a big believer in\
  \ winging it. I\u2019m a big believer that you\u2019re never going to find perfect\
  \ city travel experience or the perfect meal without a constant willingness to experience\
  \ a bad one. Letting the happy accident happen is what a lot of vacation itineraries\
  \ miss, I think, and I\u2019m always trying to push people to allow those things\
  \ to happen rather than stick to some rigid itinerary.\" \nThis motto I carried\
  \ with me when my sister, two Moroccan friends, and I took a taxi to the halls where\
  \ they always have weddings. Our new friends told us that they always host weddings\
  \ there on the weekends with many guests. So we dressed up to look fabulous and\
  \ \u201Ccrashed a wedding\u201D (gracefully) to enjoy the live music, the energetic\
  \ dancers and the family we were not apart of (haha). \nThe unexpected, the warmth,\
  \ the colorful decorations, the generosity became part of my adventurous stories.\
  \ When I travel, it makes me become a poet, a photographer, and a storyteller. It\
  \ makes me want to read more inspiring quotes by Rumi and Anthony Bourdain and wonder\
  \ how many more lessons I can learn through each person that is writing their own\
  \ story. Rumi once said, \u201CLive with no excuses and travel with no regrets.\u201D"
