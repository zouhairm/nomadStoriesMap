Text: "I was 22 when I went to Europe initially . I was so exciting because of the\
  \ fact that I was wondering almost everything about Europe and It was my first abroad\
  \ experience.  \n     My first experience was on border. I had gone to in Lviv,\
  \ Then ,I went to bus station actually people did not know English but they tried\
  \ to help me, It was so nice for me, I did not expect like that, after  I found\
  \ a bus  for going Poland. On the border, Polish Soldiers checked my stuffs with\
  \ dogs. I was so afraid due to the fact that I did not want to any problem. Actually\
  \ Soldiers were right about checking me because This was my first coming to Europe.\n\
  \     When I arrived to Poland, I did not trust to my English because I don\u2019\
  t speak English in Turkey. I thought  If I speak English , People can laugh to me\
  \ but I understood  my fear was nothing  after almost a couple hours . \n     Although\
  \  All of the Erasmus students come from variety countries, People tried to understand\
  \ each other and they tried to learn about the other cultures. I was not alone there\
  \ because people wanted to the same conditions for Erasmus. I thought sometimes\
  \  . We fought  almost 50 or 100 years ago but people wanted to make friends. I\
  \ liked this condition.\n      Moreover,  I was getting friends after every days.\
  \ When I went to outside, I saw familiar faces. People said to me hello in Polish\
  \ and I answered to them hello in Turkish.  When I talked with people , they asked\
  \ a lot of questions about my country. I tried to teach something about my country.\
  \ People were interested in my country because they only heard on TV about Turkey\
  \ bad news. When  I showed them about my Turkish cities, They were so surprised\
  \ and I asked questions about Poland , They always tried to teach something. After\
  \ 1 moth, I understood Polish culture. Actually, I realized that Polish culture\
  \ and Turkish culture are so similar.\n     Furthermore, When I talked with the\
  \ other countries people, I realized that Almost every country share the similar\
  \ things.  It is so incredible for me because we live different countries  and we\
  \ are different religion.\n     Finally, When my Erasmus finished, I came back to\
  \ Turkey. After 2 weeks , I talked with my parents and I said I want to go to Europe\
  \ again. Now , I am in Slovakia. I so happy here because I am free here and I want\
  \ to go on my life. I want to go on learning about culture, history. Actually, I\
  \ could go to in Portugal for Erasmus but This was not happen . I hope so , I will\
  \ come to Portugal  in one day."
