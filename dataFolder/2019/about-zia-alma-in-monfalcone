Text: "My travel experience began when I met Alma, known by all my friends and relatives\
  \ as \"Zia Alma\". I met her when I was very young, during a trip in my home town\
  \ in Italy. I went in Monfalcone to visit my grandmother and she introduced me to\
  \ Alma. \nMy home town was just like a trivial small city in Italy where you can\
  \ feel the traditions and the habits that mark the inhabitants but during the last\
  \ years everything changed and we all live together with different people from all\
  \ over the world: Indians, Slovenian minority, Moldavians, Albanians, Africans,\
  \ etc. we are not an Italian town anymore.\nZia Alma is like a sunshine in this\
  \ multicultural city. She represents the roots of Monfalcone and each sign on her\
  \ face show us what changes during these years mean to her. \nThe most beautiful\
  \ part of Monfalcone is the avenue with pebbles where my mother used to play when\
  \ she was a child. Children jumped the rope or played hide and seek when mothers\
  \ cooked pasta with ragout for lunch for the entire family. You can easily imagine\
  \ all those women in the kitchens with kitchen apron and wood spoon mixing the sauce\
  \ in a saucepan. There is a church with its bell tower and all around a park where\
  \ I used to go with my father each Sunday after the church service waiting for the\
  \ best part of the day: ice cream. \nNow everything is different and small shops\
  \ of Indians are the priority, there is also a kebab shop where young people go\
  \ after a hangover.\nWhen I go to visit Zia Alma, we always speak about all our\
  \ memories, mostly hers. She is now almost 99 years old and her memories are never-ending.\
  \ \nShe can easily remember the time when she started school and after five years\
  \ she started working as seamstress. First in the shop at the first floor above\
  \ the arch in front of the church and after that privately at her home. I often\
  \ bring her too wide t-shirts, too long dresses or too short jeans and she, happy\
  \ as never to silence my endless complaints, arranges them to perfection.\nI always\
  \ spend whole afternoons at home with her, without having a coffee, but talking\
  \ a little bit about everyone. She also tells me about her long and endless journeys\
  \ around the world, advising me never to waste the opportunity to travel the world.\n\
  When I went to university and then went to her to tell her I will graduate she was\
  \ so happy. At the party she wanted to go on partying after 1 am, even if the place\
  \ had to close.\nI like to listen to her when she tells me that, during the War,\
  \ she always went by bike around our city and when she came home, used the hidden\
  \ streets in order to not be found by the soldiers who would have taken away the\
  \ freshly picked vegetables. Although they were hard times, she manages to find\
  \ the ridiculous sides and beautiful memories that warm her heart.\nShe has a strong\
  \ and determined character and has never needed anyone to tell her what to do or\
  \ how to answer.\nAs a young woman she spent entire evenings dancing, always among\
  \ the people but she also always showed her skills and dedication to sewing.\nI\
  \ always laugh when I bring her pastries or chocolates because in five minutes she\
  \ eats a half pack. I could only get along with a good eater like her.\nWhen I tell\
  \ her about my work she is proud of me because my independence is getting closer\
  \ and closer. You should never depend on others, but always be autonomous in everything.\
  \ And you should never give up on travel (just to reiterate), so \"save money for\
  \ traveling as much as you can\".\nZia Alma is really good! She is an independent\
  \ woman who knows how to enjoy life and take every adversity. She is one of the\
  \ women of my life and she is the story of Monfalcone."
