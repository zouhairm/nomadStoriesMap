Text: "\"Life will always be a difficult challenge, Dan. Your only choice will be\
  \ how to respond to it. Be prepared to learn the lessons\". These words echoed in\
  \ Dan Fern's mind that Monday, November 3, 2014, like knives entering the flesh.\
  \ He could remember the unique tone of his grandfather's voice, which had repeated\
  \ this mantra since childhood. At age 24, Fern was now a young Brazilian lawyer,\
  \ who worked in the Government of Brasilia, capital of Brazil, dealing with adolescents\
  \ who committed crimes.\nHowever, Fern was not in his office interviewing the teenagers\
  \ who would have to serve their sentences, nor writing reports that would be read\
  \ by the judge responsible for judging the adolescents. He was walking along the\
  \ Am Rosenh\xFCgel, a street in Krems an der Donau, going from the hotel to IMC\
  \ Fachhochschule, where he spent a month studying Public Management and Leadership.\
  \ The intense November cold in Austria may seem freezing to a Brazilian, accustomed\
  \ to temperatures at least 20 degrees higher.\nHaving lost his mother at the age\
  \ of four, having never met his father, and having been raised by his grandparents\
  \ with every conceivable difficulty, Fern had reacted well to the challenges life\
  \ had brought him: he was a lawyer, he worked for the government, books on law.\
  \ He had also passed the exam he had brought him to this winter course in Austria.\n\
  That was the perfect chance to learn about Public Management, which could be used\
  \ in your government work, and it would be the first time you would leave your country\
  \ to meet other cultures, lifestyles, and countries. The Amsterdam stopover was\
  \ the first memory recorded in his mind as he watched live the scenes he was used\
  \ to see only on television.\nUpon arriving at the University, attending the first\
  \ fully English-taught class and seeing himself in that high-level academic environment,\
  \ Fern knew that his life would change forever, because he knew it was a unique\
  \ opportunity to make a leap into the unknown, learning the lessons life wanted\
  \ to teach.\nThat journey would also serve for an inner quest, which he had been\
  \ planning for a long time, since he read about the \"original energy\", that which\
  \ moves a person's life, leading to great achievements. Europe it was the perfect\
  \ place to do that.\nConsidering that he would have the weekends free, he decided\
  \ to study hard during the week days and to travel in the off-season. On the first\
  \ weekend, he went to Budapest, Hungary, and knew the bridges, the weather, the\
  \ castles and the pleasant view on the banks of the Danube. On the second weekend,\
  \ it was Bratislava, and it was the incredible view on the Danube, the squares,\
  \ the sculptures and the famous UFO Restaurant, which resembles a flying saucer\
  \ on the bank of a bridge over the Danube River.\nDuring the course, as part of\
  \ the class program, he met other wonderful cities such as Vienna, Durnstein and\
  \ Melk.\nBut it was on the third weekend, after an intense trip to Prague, in the\
  \ Czech Republic, that Dan Fern began to find what he was looking for. His original\
  \ energy. Seated on the steps of the National Museum of Prague (N\xE1rodn\xED muzeum),\
  \ a very intense thought occurred to him, and he was able to open his perception\
  \ to delve into it.\nThere, on a cold Sunday afternoon, he realized that we are\
  \ meant to evolve. Exit one condition and get to another better. To be able to know\
  \ that life will always present difficult and difficult challenges to be won, but\
  \ we can react well and overcome them. He had won.\nAt the end of the period of\
  \ study, and receiving his diploma, she received a warm hug from the University's\
  \ director, who, smiling, asked him how he was feeling after successfully completing\
  \ the course.\nDan Fern looked into the teacher's immense green eyes and said those\
  \ famous grandfather\u2019s words. \"Teacher, life is a challenge that leads us\
  \ to evolve. It\u2019s up to us to choose how to respond to it and whether we will\
  \ learn the lessons\u201D."
