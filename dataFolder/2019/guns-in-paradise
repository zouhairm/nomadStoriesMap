Text: "It had been over an hour since we had ditched the national highway. Our old\
  \ red Maruti 800 was wobbling through the dirt road. We were surrounded by pine\
  \ trees on both sides of the hill. Day light was disappearing and we had no way\
  \ of finding out where we were. Google maps didn't exist at that time so all we\
  \ could do was rely on our father's gut and navigation skills.\_\n\n\n---\n\nWe\
  \ had been preparing for this trip for days. Our mother made my younger sister and\
  \ me rehearse fake answers about ourselves.\n\"Where are you coming from?\"\n\"\
  Delhi\"\n\"What does your father do?\"\n\"He's a bank manager.\"\_\nAfter every\
  \ rehearsal my mother made both of us promise that we will not tell anybody about\
  \ who we were in reality. My father on the other hand prepared for the trip in a\
  \ rather unusual manner. He grew a stubble for the first time in his life. For our\
  \ road trip through Kashmir he also managed to borrow a bright red Maruti 800 which\
  \ looked like it had seen better days.\_\n\n\nThe day of our journey arrived. We\
  \ stuffed the car with all our luggage and just as we were about to leave, my father\
  \ took out his pistol and placed it under the driver's seat. My mother looked at\
  \ him but said nothing.\_\nMy father wasn't a bank manager. He was an officer in\
  \ the Indian Army and was stationed in Jammu and Kashmir. Given the insurgency situation\
  \ in Kashmir we were advised against the trip. We went anyway.\_\nAs our car exited\
  \ the military camp I rolled down my side of the window and let the crisp air hit\
  \ my face. I was too young to be afraid.\n\n\nTravelling by road in an unfamiliar\
  \ territory opens up your senses and allows you to experience and interact with\
  \ the place a little more holistically. It helps you brush off your touristy haste\
  \ and allows you to soak in everything that is on offer.\_\n\n\nAs we exited the\
  \ other side of the Jawahar tunnel, the mountains grew less menacing and eventually\
  \ flattened out. Our final approach to the Kashmir valley had begun.\_\nThe valley\
  \ welcomed us with all the colours of spring. Dizzy from our drive through the mountains,\
  \ we ordered ourselves a few cups of kahwa, the local tea. Outside the window I\
  \ could see men from the armed forces positioned every few hundred meters. Barbed\
  \ wires everywhere were draining the life out of spring.\_\nOver the next few days,\
  \ we travelled across the city of Srinagar, the summer capital of Jammu & Kashmir.\
  \ We visited temples which looked like military garrisons from the outside and forts\
  \ which had been stripped of their royalty. Our last stop in Srinagar was the Dal(lake\
  \ in Kashmiri). Dotted with shikaras and house boats, the Dal is encompassed by\
  \ Mughal era gardens, parks and hotels on either sides. It is in the Dal that hints\
  \ of an older, freer Kashmir still exist. A Kashmir that still dreams about happiness.\
  \ \_\n\n\n\n\n---\n\nAs the daylight died down, I felt the tensions rise up in the\
  \ car. My mother sat stiffer than usual and kept looking back to check if everything\
  \ is fine with us. Today was the last day of our road trip through Kashmir. We had\
  \ gone to the valley of flowers in Gulmarg and spent our afternoon having one of\
  \ the best Kashmiri meals of our trip. Everything had gone fine up till.\n\"Are\
  \ you sure this is where the camp is\", my mother asked my father.\_\nHe pointed\
  \ out towards the pine trees outside and said, \"can you see the wire going from\
  \ one tree to the other\", my father asked. My mother nodded.\_\n\"Where these wires\
  \ end is where we'll find the camp\", my father added.\_\nWe drove for a few more\
  \ minutes and we arrived to a military camp right in the middle of a pine forest.\
  \ We wouldn't need the pistol anymore."
