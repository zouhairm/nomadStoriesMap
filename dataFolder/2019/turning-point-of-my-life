Text: 'I visited Goa in 2015 when I was just 16 years old. When I visited over there
  the environment and the culture of that city is completely different.


  I made a connection of love in 10 days we''ll that time it was just the attraction
  but after 2 months of talk we realized its a love. Though my relation worked for
  3 years but recently I lost her in a accident so yes that trip was the turning point
  of my life. I will never forget that trip because I found the love of my life however
  I lost but still it will be there in my heart for the rest of my life.  Moreover
  I got to know about myself when I helped 7 girls to come out from a sex racket in
  Goa. The thing was like that there were few girls who were teen agers. Those girls
  were going on a beach and I found 3 boys who were looking them Constantly in a bad
  manner and then they offered a modeling photoshoot to those girls but I don''t know
  why I felt something fishy so I just followed them and got to know about the entire
  seen. And then I contacted police and took help from a localite person to get rid
  of that problem. That thing was the most amazing moment of my life. The best feeling
  I have ever get in Goa.'
