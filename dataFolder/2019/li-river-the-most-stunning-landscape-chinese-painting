Text: "In her first trip to Guilin, Evio found a connection to learn the meaningful\
  \ landscape painting through the wonderful scenery of Li River. \n\nIt is clear\
  \ that,  reminding Guilin my favorite spot here must be Li River. It was the most\
  \ natural- stunning landscapes, Li River has long laid claim to having the most\
  \ beautiful scenery in Guilin, China. It was just like a natural painting. Little\
  \ did I know, most of Chinese artists were inspired from Li River on his paintings.\
  \ \nMy first time to have cycling tour around Li River was a sunny day. Everything\
  \ was extremely attractive for me. The green scenery and the comfortable temperature\
  \ will let you to forget about the trouble in the daily life. Even in a summer day,\
  \ this place was also cool enough. The beautiful of Li River made me so happy that\
  \ I did not feel any tired during the cycling along the Li River.\nWhile, it was\
  \ not my solo trip. I had a scholarship of Grand Summer Camp Program in Guangxi\
  \ Normal University. So, it\u2019s only two weeks I am in Guilin. Besides I visit\
  \ to Li River, I've been just  waiting for learning Chinese painting in the class.\
  \ I like painting and sketching. I often joined the urbansketcher or sketchwalker\
  \ community in my hometown to capture buildings and historical places to be poured\
  \ into sketches by using pencils or watercolors.\nAs I had learned in class, We\
  \ draw a flower by using black ink, brush and watercolors to mix the media. My Laoshi\
  \ (means teacher) also said that Landscape painting is the highest form of Chinese\
  \ painting. In the north, artists paint towering mountain using black lines, ink\
  \ brushes, brush points to describe stones. While, in the south, artists paint rolling\
  \ hills and rivers from their native regions in a peaceful atmosphere with soft\
  \ wood ink. The two types of scenery and techniques became the classic style of\
  \ Chinese landscape painting. Of course, it is contrary to Indonesian painting which\
  \ are heavily influenced by western artists. \n\nAlong the route to Li River, the\
  \ scenery of bamboo, green fields and quiet hills were so wonderful. From the side\
  \ of Li River, the reflection of hills in the water, ripples, and all the scenes,\
  \ I felt that maybe I am in a dream. I heard from my Laoshi that Li River is always\
  \ beauty all year round even in sunshine, rainy, snow, mist, all the weathers. That's\
  \ why, it has a different beauties which can attracts tourists from all over the\
  \ world. So, my friends and I have so many taking of pictures along the Li River\
  \ route. Because it's a beautiful trip and our first summer in Guilin. Oh, I really\
  \ thanks to my friends who handle the bike very well so that I could catch many\
  \ interesting photos. \n\nInevitably, the beauty of Li River was poured by many\
  \ artists into the paintings. The wonderful view in a combination of  rivers and\
  \ hills. I feel so admired the beauty of Li River and also felt what other artists\
  \ felt. It feels like I found a bond of soul connectivity felt by artists who have\
  \ visited there. I want to capture it in my own sketch collection by using watercolor.\
  \ Unfortunately, at that time I had not have the chance to do live sketching in\
  \ Li River. Because we are in group and we will continue to the next destination.\
  \ But,  I take many of pictures with an attractive angle then sketch it latter.\
  \ \n\nEventhough I used to being in watercolor in painting, but I'm having a little\
  \ trouble when using an ink brush. My hand still feels so stiff. However, with My\
  \ little bit painting's skill, I can combine using Chinese ink as an urban sketch\
  \ or painting of monochrome that seems more interesting. Even I know, I still have\
  \ to learn more about the techniques of using brush ink. While, from Lu River I\
  \ learned a lot about the beauty of landscape painting that I have never met and\
  \ is characteristic of this country. It was so meaningful for me."
