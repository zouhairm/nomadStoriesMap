Text: "\u201CCan you imagine seeing them in the desert?\u201D, she asked, her eyes\
  \ locked upon the night sky. She had driven me out of town to watch the stars, like\
  \ she did every August since I was a child. However, that was the first summer I\
  \ spent home in four years, since I left for college. All the others, I had been\
  \ travelling.  \n\u201CValid for one adventure in the desert\u201D, read the homemade\
  \ voucher she got for her next birthday, March 8th. She looked at me trying to see\
  \ if I was joking. Ever since Dad got sick their world had been shrinking, and she\
  \ had come to accept it. They had grown used to travel through me, waiting for the\
  \ stories, the pictures, the long-distance call. He smiled at her from his bed.\
  \ He wasn\u2019t joking either. For once, it was time for Mum to fly.\n\u201CThen,\
  \ how much further to the desert?\u201D, I ask the driver, and he laughs at my impatience.\
  \ We have been driving eastwards from Marrakech for two days now, through gorges,\
  \ oases and brown villages born at the roadside. The car grows smaller every minute\
  \ and I \u2014the experienced traveler\u2015 cannot stand it anymore. However, Mum\
  \ is not complaining, so I don\u2019t say another word. She insisted that I sit\
  \ in the front to handle the conversation with our Moroccan driver. Unsurprisingly,\
  \ she has spent most of the trip speaking with him from the backseat. To our cicerone\u2019\
  s delight, not an embarrassing childhood anecdote has been left untold. \nTrying\
  \ to give Mum a seamless trip from airport to desert, I almost stripped her of everything\
  \ that makes an adventure an adventure. Luckily, Morocco had its own plans for us.\
  \ So, the same woman that never showed any patience for my disorganized bedroom\
  \ submerged eagerly into the orchestrated chaos of the Medina. She bargained hard\
  \ for a silver tea set that now has no place in our cabin luggage. She ate dubious\
  \ tajin in our fancy Riad, and tasty bread in a dubious street stand. She laughed\
  \ with our female city guide discussing how to keep Moroccan men in line. She experienced\
  \ that our neighbors to the south are something more than people to pity or fear,\
  \ depending on your newsfeed. She explored, conversed, ate, laughed, feared, complained,\
  \ thanked, was ripped off, was helped. And I was there to watch.\nNow, entering\
  \ the final stretch of our journey, we are greeted with a sandstorm. If the desert\
  \ thought that would keep us away, it only increases our enthusiasm. Soon, we glimpse\
  \ a sign: \u201CMerzouga: gate of the desert\u201D. The van stops at the edge of\
  \ the dunes, where asphalt comes to an end. A teenager in a blue robe emerges guiding\
  \ two camels that lean docilly for us. Mum was never fond of animals, but she chooses\
  \ the one in the front and, before I can protest, the placid beast lifts her effortlessly.\
  \ And to think she never let me have a dog.\nOnce the car has disappeared behind\
  \ the dunes, all there is to see is this unending world of sand. It feels unreal,\
  \ impossible that such place could exist, as if every line and every dune had just\
  \ been drawn for us. The silhouette of our little caravan against the sunset light\
  \ reminds me of those times the Three Wise Men brought me Christmas gifts during\
  \ the night, when Mum and I used to leave liquor for them and water for their camels.\
  \ Now I understand why they were always so thirsty. After a while, our young guide\
  \ stops the camels. We can walk the last stretch to the camp, he says. We do everything\
  \ but walking. We run, roll, crawl, up and down the dunes. We make sand angels,\
  \ we take pictures for Dad, we fill up bottles to take a drop of that ocean back\
  \ with us.\nHours later, exhausted, we stare at the night sky near the ashes of\
  \ our campfire. Of all the good reasons to come to the desert, the best one is to\
  \ see the stars. Of all the good reasons to travel, the best one is to someday be\
  \ back home."
