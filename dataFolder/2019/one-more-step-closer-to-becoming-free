Text: "With travel truly being the biggest desire on my heart it is also when I truly\
  \ feel whole. A defining moment in my testimony began in Perth, Australia that continued\
  \ into Kolkata, India and has continued to overtake my everyday thoughts as of now.\
  \ I know I\u2019m meant to travel the world and to inspire others by telling my\
  \ story. My story on how God set me free. God is the center of this story just so\
  \ you\u2019re aware I don\u2019t like throwing curved balls. I think people may\
  \ truly be in awe when they see how much God works through people in everyday life.\
  \ I think my story which consists of chaos,trauma, disfunction, sorrow, once in\
  \ a lifetime life experiences, spiritual encounters and much joy will really resonate\
  \ with people in a deep way. I think traveling the world is the most important thing.\
  \ Why? Because you see other cultures, you see other ways of functioning as a society,\
  \ you meet a variety of people, one thing you start to realize is we are all the\
  \ same. We are all equal. No one is any better or any less than anyone. In my opinion,\
  \ that\u2019s what this country maybe even the world, has truly forgotten. I hope\
  \ to reopen people\u2019s eyes, open ears and soften hearts so that we all see a\
  \ little more truth in the world."
