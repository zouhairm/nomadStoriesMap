Text: "I still remember those quiet afternoons leafing through old copies of National\
  \ Geographic magazine in the stuffy basement of my grandparents\u2019 house in Maryland.\
  \ My parents didn\u2019t travel much, but that was the one big trip we made every\
  \ year. Unlike me, they had a habit of napping after lunch, and I spent that time\
  \ rummaging through those dusty magazines, engrossed by how mysterious the world\
  \ had become. Ancient ruins of Angkor Wat, giant statues on Easter Island, modern\
  \ day tribes in Kurdistan. It was also the first time I saw a picture of Machu Picchu,\
  \ and I never forgot it.\n\nOn a cool misty morning more than two decades later,\
  \ divorced and searching for a new beginning, I boarded a bus in the rustic hillside\
  \ town of Aguas Calientes. Tucked away high up in the Peruvian Andes, this backpacker\u2019\
  s refuge was my final stop on a journey that had started two days prior in Gainesville,\
  \ Florida.\n\nI woke up at 4:30 that morning in my hotel room, adrenaline pumping\
  \ through my veins. I washed down an ordinary western breakfast with coffee and\
  \ freshly squeezed orange juice, grabbed my backpack and made my way through narrow\
  \ cobblestone streets to the bus terminal teaming with wide-eyed tourists. Next\
  \ to me was a young lady who turned out to be from Poland. She was about my age\
  \ with brown hair and hazel eyes that evoked a longing hard to put into words. When\
  \ the bus took off, I asked my Polish neighbor if she was meeting anyone up there.\
  \ She took a deep breath and replied, \u201Cno.\u201D\n\n\u201CThis is for me,\u201D\
  \ she said without further elaboration.\n\n\u201CIs that an English accent I detect?\u201D\
  \ I later asked.\n\n\u201CWell,\u201D she said, smiling. \u201CI lived in England\
  \ for a few years.\u201D\n\nAs the bus looped around the muddy road and we began\
  \ approaching the clouds, I started to catch glimpses of that picture I saw long\
  \ ago in my grandparents\u2019 basement, fluttering in and out like a distant hummingbird.\n\
  \nTo finally behold Machu Picchu is to approach something magnificently sublime.\
  \ There are few places in the world where feeling precedes sight itself. From that\
  \ first observation point, my Polish companion and I gazed into a world that was\
  \ as foreign as it was familiar. Mist was gently rising over the mountain top, and\
  \ granite walls still intact five hundred years later shimmered in the morning sun.\n\
  \nAs we continued to higher ground, long lines of people were waiting to take selfies.\
  \ A young couple, lying against a terrace, had their eyes closed. I wanted to ask\
  \ my new friend what had brought her here, but it felt obtrusive. We eventually\
  \ lost track of each other, and I made my way up the terraces for a better view.\
  \ \n\nWe ran into each other again on her way back down from the Sun Gate. Her face\
  \ was beaming with excitement.\n\n\u201CI couldn\u2019t make it all the way,\u201D\
  \ she exclaimed.\n\n\u201CMaybe I\u2019ll go for it,\u201D I offered.\n\n\u201C\
  Do it for me too,\u201D she said.\n\nAn hour later, sweaty and breathless, I finally\
  \ found the Sun Gate. I was over nine thousand feet high. A cool breeze washed over\
  \ my damp shirt. In the distance, stood the Sanctuary- ancient, regal, and very\
  \ much alive. In broken Spanish, I spoke to one of the guides who was kind enough\
  \ to tell me that the Sun Gate was the original entry point to Machu Picchu. I took\
  \ a few pictures hoping to run into my friend again, but that was the last time\
  \ I saw her.\n\nOn the bus ride back that night, I sat next to an Italian couple\
  \ and a young lady from Canada with close cropped hair who later shared that she\
  \ had gotten over a serious bout of cancer and now cherished each day as though\
  \ it was a gift. We told each other stories and laughed at our cultural stereotypes.\n\
  \nAfter we parted ways, as I walked back to my hotel room with only the moonlight\
  \ as my guide, I thought of our Inca forebears, and how little they truly knew centuries\
  \ ago of what they had gifted us that day, even for my Polish friend."
