Text: "My world shifted - too far to the left, and then the right. The pancakes I\
  \ was making, that had seconds before been I-Hop perfect, oozed into misshapen blobs.\
  \ I was aboard the fishing vessel Family Pride. Floating, but in over my head. \
  \ \n\nA month before, I had been standing behind the counter of Harborside Coffee,\
  \ smelling faintly of bleach and coffee, taking orders and butchering foam art.\
  \ Oblivious to my life\u2019s impending upheaval, its catalyst, a 6\u20192\u201D\
  \ gangly transplant from Oregon. He smelled overly ripe, carried his laundry in\
  \ a worn duffel and himself in a chipper \u201CI\u2019ve just conquered the world\
  \ by waking up\u201D kind of way. He was one of the many seasonal transplants that\
  \ show up in Kodiak, Alaska for the summer; dispersing as soon as the salmon season\
  \ came to an end - checks in hand, leaving the town feeling a little barren without\
  \ their rambunctious energy. They were not new to me \u2013 I had spent two years\
  \ at the top of the harbour, serving them coffee, watching as they transitioned\
  \ from unkempt, bearded hooligans to clean-shaven nomads.   \n\nThis particular\
  \ bearded hooligan was a friend who showed up every May, worked for a particularly\
  \ cranky, but effective captain; and then spent his winters traipsing the parts\
  \ of the world that allowed his money to stretch until he could come back and do\
  \ it all over again. Listening to his tales had always dredged up envy, but this\
  \ year was different, the envy had festered -- infected by a feeling of lethargy\
  \ -- and I was feverish with it.  \n\nI stood there, surrounded by cartons of milk,\
  \ dusted with Ghirardelli chocolate when his un-showered (total presumption) butt\
  \ wandered cheerfully in. He announced that he was going to Costa-Rica in the fall,\
  \ and since it wasn\u2019t his first time, he regaled me with stories of sunshine\
  \ and swells. I was trying not to pour any of my bitterness into his white mocha,\
  \ when out nowhere he tipped forward, practically falling over my counter to whisper\
  \ \u201CYou know Lil, you could fish this season. You\u2019re not stuck.\u201D \
  \ \n\nSometimes you just need to hear it said out loud.   \n\nWhich brings us back\
  \ to my first attempt at pancakes on my first attempt at fishing.  I had signed\
  \ up as the \u2018fifth man\u2019 on a fifty-eight-foot seiner that fished from\
  \ June to September for salmon. The boat was a cloudless blue, with yellow trim,\
  \ a top-house; and enough rust to make a junkyard jealous. The crew consisted of:\
  \ The captain, a man with an imposing physique, but a quiet watchfulness that left\
  \ me clumsy; a couple of young deckhands who made\n\u201Cthat\u2019s what she said\u201D\
  \ jokes on the daily, but were sweet and willing to do the dishes; and then last,\
  \ and also least, (because I couldn\u2019t stand the man) was the skiff-man. His\
  \ stomach poured as profusely from his grey T-shirt as his sweat, and when he wasn\u2019\
  t smoking and chugging diet coke by the litre, he was making comments meant to make\
  \ me uncomfortable enough to jump ship. He was every fisherwoman\u2019s nightmare,\
  \ and here I was, making him sloppy pancakes in a grease-streaked galley while the\
  \ waves played catch with our boat.  \n\nWhen I had finally managed to balance the\
  \ pancakes, and myself, albeit precariously; I teetered my way to the heavy wooden\
  \ door that served as a comforting buffer to the outside world, pushed it open,\
  \ and watched as my fellow crew-members, dressed head to toe in heavy, orange rain-gear,\
  \ slid as sloppily around the deck as the items they were trying to secure -- waves\
  \ sloshing their feet out from under them the moment they managed to regain their\
  \ footing.  The door created a frame for the turmoil, and it played like a film:\
  \ the deck-boards groaned theatrically, the crew screamed lines that were never\
  \ heard, the waves performed their own stunts and were relentless. My adrenalin\
  \ responded to the scene. I had never been so terrified of dying, or so acutely\
  \ aware that I was alive. I thought of the boat, tethered to nothing; as unstuck\
  \ as it got."
