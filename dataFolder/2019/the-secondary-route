Text: "It was a three hour long trip until the place chosen for a family weekend getaway\
  \ \u2013 the first my grandfather was participating in. Our relationship was based\
  \ mostly on the greetings on the occasional family lunch. At fourteen years old,\
  \ my conversations with him had never gone beyond \u201CHello, how are you?\u201D\
  \ and \u201CBye, see you next time!\u201D. Among my siblings, I had been the chosen\
  \ to keep him company through his trip. Considerably annoyed and scared, I entered\
  \ my grandfather\u2019s car: \u201CHello, how are you?\u201D both of us said before\
  \ the silence settled in. \u201CThis is going to be the most boring trip of my life\u201D\
  , I thought to myself before having the most enriching experience of my life. \n\
  He drove off my house towards the river. There is a road alongside the shore known\
  \ to be an appealing drive \u2013 it connects the oceanfront beaches with the city\
  \ enclosed in the river\u2019s estuary. The soft classical music coming from the\
  \ radio made the silence bearable. It was January and the grey sky was turning what\
  \ is usually a vivid contrast of a wild green riverbank and a colourful built city,\
  \ into an unhappy slosh of different grey tones. The wave intensity was reducing\
  \ as we drove towards the city. A tall red bridge with two pillars connected with\
  \ lighted strings is the first connection between the two shores. \u201CI could\
  \ probably reach the other side if I swam there\u201D I thought, even though, at\
  \ the distance, a cruise with what seemed like a couple dozen floors sailed easily\
  \ beneath the bridge. The traffic intensifies as we drive through the connecting\
  \ roads of the bridge and only softens once we pass the second bridge, one wide\
  \ enough to hold seven lanes of cars and with no end in sight. Its colour matched\
  \ the sky. \nI wake up suddenly, expecting to see an endless highway ahead and behind\
  \ the car. To my surprise, I see the same picture as before: we were still driving\
  \ alongside the river in a small road. I had slept for forty-five minutes according\
  \ to the car\u2019s digital watch. The radio was on the same station; we were still\
  \ going sixty in a national road; and my grandfather had the same expression. He\
  \ was a seventy-something fat man, with a round face and short thin white hair.\
  \ \u201CGood morning!\u201D he said smiling. \u201CWhere are we?\u201D I asked looking\
  \ around outside confused. The river had become extremely narrow and more aggressive,\
  \ the shores were now both filled with trees and small hills that covered the road.\
  \ \u201CNowhere exactly\u201D he replied. My confused look made him continue \u201C\
  In a few minutes we will reach the medieval town\u201D.  \u201CMonfortinho?\u201D\
  \ I asked. \u201CNo! We are still a long way from there! There is so much to experience\
  \ on the way!\u201D. He proceeded to tell to me that he did not like highways and\
  \ preferred delving into the national roads and get to know the small towns on the\
  \ way to his destination. This was a different trip than what I was expecting. \n\
  Once we got to the hotel, the rest of my family was already there. \u201CHow was\
  \ your trip? Why did you take so long? We left two hours later than you and already\
  \ got here a long time ago!\u201D. As my cousins mocked me and my parents disapproved\
  \ my grandfather\u2019s choice of route, I understood that none of them knew the\
  \ beauty of traveling: if you have a destination set, you end up missing the trip\
  \ until you reach it. The three hour trip had turned into a seven hour long adventure\
  \ with visits to castles, a discussion with the police, befriending a restaurant\
  \ owner, crossing flooded roads, and appreciating the beautiful sceneries. \nAt\
  \ dinner I was the only one talking. Describing the adventures of the day, while\
  \ the others had nothing to show for. I saw my grandfather smiling at me the whole\
  \ time. Despite the little conversations we had had during the day, the bond had\
  \ been created. It remains, to this day, our only connection, and why secondary\
  \ roads are always my chosen route when traveling."
