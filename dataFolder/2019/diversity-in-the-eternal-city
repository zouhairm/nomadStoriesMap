Text: "It was Spring break of my last year of my bachelor\u2019s degree. I was taking\
  \ my first international trip with the history department to Rome, Italy and what\
  \ a first trip it was. During the trip, we had a full itinerary, but I also had\
  \ to work on two school projects while I was there about the journey itself.\n\n\
  I remember getting off the plane after flying for nearly 10 hours from Columbus,\
  \ Ohio, where it was around 40 degrees, and getting hit with the Mediterranean climate\
  \ for the first time. It was culture shock to the extreme. After rushing through\
  \ security and customs in the Rome-Fiumicino Airport, I boarded the bus for the\
  \ trip to our accommodations north of Vatican City.\n\nWhile I was tired from the\
  \ long international flight, I couldn\u2019t keep my eyes off of the sites around\
  \ us. We traversed the city by bus, seeing the sites that I have only read about\
  \ and seen in pictures for the very first time. But two things stood out to me the\
  \ most; the amount of graffiti displayed throughout many parts of the city and the\
  \ high number of immigrants. \n\nWhen one thinks of the Eternal City, they typically\
  \ think of the Roman ruins for the deities, the Colosseum, the Pantheon, and the\
  \ Trevi Fountain. But this wasn\u2019t what I thought of while on the bus. I thought\
  \ of the beauty of the city, even with all of the glaring problems with colorful\
  \ graffiti on their buildings and overpopulation from immigrants.\n\nAsk one person\
  \ in Rome one problem that they would love to fix in their city and they will likely\
  \ say immigration. Immigrants arrive in Italy, but many of them decide to settle\
  \ in Rome because of the opportunities that the city offered. This trip was my first\
  \ time experiencing so many immigrants in person. And now I can understand why they\
  \ do it.\n\nThe director of the program told us that there would be a lot of beggars,\
  \ particularly around touristy areas, and that we should avoid pulling out all of\
  \ our money in front of them but to keep a few spare Euros in our pocket if we wanted\
  \ to give them any. I have since heeded her advice on all of my trips, domestic\
  \ and international.\n\nOne beggar\u2019s story, in particular, hit me hard. She\
  \ was an immigrant who had to leave her young children behind. She was trying to\
  \ raise the money to bring them over from Libya but was having trouble because of\
  \ the American way of thinking about beggars. In the United States, we have become\
  \ accustomed to thinking that beggars are only doing it for alcohol or drugs, but\
  \ that is not always the case, particularly in places like Rome.\n\nBeggars are\
  \ not always the only way that immigrants earn money in Rome. Many of them operate\
  \ small shop stands throughout various parts of the city. They sell trinkets to\
  \ tourists at a reasonable price, and these costs are supposed to be used to go\
  \ towards helping them have a better life in Rome. After talking with one man, I\
  \ learned this was not always the case.\n\nThis stand worker was an immigrant from\
  \ India. He came to Rome hoping to have a better life than he had there. He told\
  \ me of traveling from India to Europe before making his way to Rome, where he had\
  \ hoped he\u2019d be able to make enough money to survive on. But what he didn\u2019\
  t expect was that the owner of the stand would take the majority of his profits\
  \ for the business and only give him a small amount to live on. Having so much money\
  \ withheld was a devastating setback for the man who had hoped to have a better\
  \ life in Rome.\n\nWhile everyone thinks of Rome as the \u201CEternal City,\u201D\
  \ they forget that it is just like any other city. It has its problems just like\
  \ any other major city in the world. But Rome can overcome these obstacles because\
  \ of the great diversity of its citizens and tourists."
