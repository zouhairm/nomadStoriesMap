Text: "Non popular spots of Europe.\n\nI didn\u2019t expect to find Baltic countries\
  \ so beautiful and interesting.\nEverybody knows that the most popular countries\
  \ in Europe are France, Italy, Germany and mostly Central Europe. But the growing\
  \ tendency are little cities of different European countries and such as Hungary,\
  \ Baltic and Balkan countries.\nSo from my childhood I remembered the book where\
  \ two girls went for their summer vacation to Estonia and did some detective stuff\
  \ there. After reading I dreamed about going there. After 12 years I finally went\
  \ to see this country. All my family and friends asked me about - why are u going\
  \ there? Do u know that Estonian people don\u2019t like Russian? Its dangerous ?\
  \ (Funny thing is that all Russians think that people in all countries don\u2019\
  t like them)\n\nI didn\u2019t know what to expect from this trip. I tried to find\
  \ all the possible information and interesting spots in all internet. Finally Im\
  \ on farry from Finland to Estonia. Lots of children running and laughing around,\
  \ strict parents trying to follow them and me, lonely girl, trying to focus on the\
  \ beautiful Baltic sea.\n\nMy hostel was located in perfect place of Tallinn - Rotermanni\n\
  First time in my life I didn\u2019t run from one sightseeing to another trying to\
  \ see everything. First time in my life I spent every minute looking on locals and\
  \ their behavior. And first time in my life I feel relaxed and enjoyed the atmosphere\
  \ of the city. I spend in Tallinn 3 days. I started every day with tasty cinnamon\
  \ bread and coffee and finished day with perfect sunset over the Baltic Sea.\n\n\
  Then I went to Riga which reminded me Russia, but just a little. I was really surprised\
  \ of how green this city is. There are lots of parks and squares and so many kids!\
  \ Everywhere were sunny, greeny and funny. It was like I am in my childhood.\n\n\
  You know I faced lots of difficult situations such as fight on the streets, robbers\
  \ in my hostel and etc. But still, from this Baltic trip I remembered sunsets, beautiful\
  \ locals and atmosphere of nice loneliness.\n\n\"What she tried to say with this\
  \ chaotic story?\" - you think now. I tried to explain all of you that you should\
  \ stop expecting something from countries based on the Instagram pics, friends stories\
  \ and internet information. Just go and explore the world. You will be surprised\
  \ how different and unusual it can be!"
