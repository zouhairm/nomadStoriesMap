Text: "I got off the plane less than three hours ago, the sun begins to hide behind\
  \ the buildings of Buenos Aires, slowly, like the gears of an old and heavy clock.\
  \ TIC Tac. Time goes by.\nI sit on a bench in front of an imponent building that,\
  \ I supose, is the Colon Theater. I say that I supose because right now I have no\
  \ certainties about anything.\nI see people go by, come and go. Businessmen in suits\
  \ talking on their cellphone, looking at the clock. There are also tourists, like\
  \ me, who are calm, taking pictures, regardless of time. \nAnd in one way or another,\
  \ no matter how different these people are, they all run out of time equally. They\
  \ lose the time of the day, yes. But they are also losing something much more important\
  \ and precious, the time of life.\nThere is a fountain near me, the water runs,\
  \ adorned by angels and coins, but runs nevertheless, it never stops running. It\
  \ does not stop for no one. Never.\nTic tac.\nLife is like that, a constant ticking,\
  \ that goes through many adornments and moments, but that never stops running after\
  \ all.\nI grab the suitcases and start walking in search of a hotel, imitating a\
  \ bit the businessman in a hurry. I try to appreciate the architecture of the place,\
  \ I absorb the smells and the landscapes. I like this city, it has something inside\
  \ it that makes it seem like time stops.\nIt is getting dark and the city lights\
  \ start to appear. The streets are increasingly filled with cars and fancy dressed\
  \ tourists. I hear the click of a camera, there is a woman next to me taking a picture\
  \ of the Obelisco. I can not help thinking that in that there is no time in that\
  \ picture, that Obelisco, that person who was unconsciously pictured in the photo\
  \ are forever trapped like that, with no way out, in the city without clocks.\n\
  The sensation of claustrophobia that a photograph can cause is unbelievable, as\
  \ well as the incredible sensation of claustrophobia that hours, minutes, and seconds\
  \ can cause. We are small entities trapped within a clock, within a life, within\
  \ a manufacturing date and an expiration date. Trapped in a container of actions,\
  \ words, memories and moments.\n\nWalking I find a hotel that seems quite reliable,\
  \ it's already dark, it's cold and my bags are starting to bother me.\nI say hello\
  \ to the man at the reception, his name is Manuel. I ask him if there is a room\
  \ available for a week and he says yes. I check in and give the suitcases to another\
  \ man at the reception. I see that Manuel writes something down in a notebook:\n\
  \nEmilia Girolimetto,\nRegistration Date: 03/05/2003\nDeparture date: 03/12/2003\n\
  I can not help thinking about the irony of the situation, everyone, absolutely everyone\
  \ has these dates that Manuel as a God writes in the notebook. We all go in to the\
  \ same hotel and we all go out through the same door.\nTime passes for all of us.\
  \ \nYou and I have our minutes counted.\nAnd tell me, what is your registration\
  \ date and what is your departure date?"
