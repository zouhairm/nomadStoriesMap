Text: "My name is sandya, basically am from middle class family. Like everyone I done\
  \ by master's degree in science. After finishing my studies I applied for different\
  \ job roles and those are located in different locations of India. Reason behind\
  \ this applying from different places, no one knew it , expect me. Because I love\
  \ to travel \u2764\uFE0F and know the culture and life style of people . More ever\
  \ enjoy the nature and connecting with there tradition . More ever I love to travel\
  \ alone so that I can face new challenges through this I can find my self how can\
  \ I manage the things, how am surving myself . In this travel,  I first visited\
  \ Bangalore where I saw the different people coming from all over the India. One\
  \ side mostly people are fighting to live on other hand mostly people are enjoying\
  \ how to spend a time . More ever it feels like me a different person while watching\
  \ all things . But I felt some what guilty because I was not well prepared for my\
  \ interview and I didn't placed in it. Then I went to Chennai , here I saw merina\
  \ beach first my in my life . Full of water ...no space to fill it in your eyes.\
  \ Side by side horse riding beacy light , kids are playing and young people came\
  \ for date and old aged ones came for walk. Now a days malls are common in every\
  \ where those are structures of modernized looks keeping everyone inside at one\
  \ place and giving artificial happyness. Those are all good for shopping sometimes\
  \ not all the time. Then formality I attended an interview in Chennai. At that moment\
  \ they said they will call you..but still now I didn't get a call from them....so,\
  \ next where I went ....????? Hyderabad famous for biriyani , culture , heritage\
  \ , cinimas , food, life style ,. Employment etc....  Hyderabad is a very historical\
  \ place .Here I saw so many things , like Birla mandhir very devotional place .it\
  \ is situated at the top most of the hill and there are so many steps and these\
  \ are covered with white marbles .....while going up you can see feel fresh air\
  \ and more positiveness in your mind . Next day I woke up with messy hair and I\
  \ got fresh then I went for breakfast near some road side hotel....I had dosa ,\
  \ my mouth was craving ..while seeing ,it is so yummy and crispy...Then next followed\
  \ by I visited golkonda , chilukuri Balaji , Hi-Tech city , In orbit mall, sujana\
  \ mall and finally my day was ended at Tonique Bar. After this I traveled to pondichery\
  \ . Even though these is situated in India but somewhat region and people are following\
  \ France consitution and tradition... Fisrt day of my trip I visited some local\
  \ temples and evening I went to beach .....while going I saw so many buildings with\
  \ different structures and clean roads before reaching beach I visited arvindha\
  \ ashram surrounding this ashramam full of trees and cleans no pollution no vehicles\
  \ are allowed .only peace of mind. After this finally I went to beach very nice\
  \ and beautiful place I went to one shop where I ordered some Italian food with\
  \ one glass of wine . It was most beautiful day I my life sitting alone in beach\
  \ restaurant and watching stars and listening sounds of waves .wow,,!!!!!! It's\
  \ like mini heaven to me.  Ended this and all what happened to my job ?? Finally\
  \ I got it But I worked there one year after that I left my job and thinking myself\
  \ where I wants to go and what I want to do .. because I need break with my life\
  \ again I wanna see new place to live and watch people and rejuvenate myself."
