Text: "I am glad she didn\u2019t know what she\u2019d find there before setting off\
  \ for that new chapter. All along it felt like a parenthesis to her actual life.\
  \ An ongoing story revolving around her someplace far from everyone that made her\
  \ life what it was. Later on, she discovered that she escaped everything that made\
  \ her who she was. \nSunday night. Another Sunday, the third one she spent in Ko\u0161\
  ice. Yet the city remained a stranger to her, like someone who would court her but\
  \ never get a chance to date her. Preferring the comfort of her window view, she\
  \ had stayed in for days, making up excuses not to stroll around. Yes, she\u2019\
  d be wandering alone - but that was familiar to her. Good thing her bed had had\
  \ enough of her body. She dressed up, made her hair, put on a bold lipstick and\
  \ sweet perfume, not knowing whether she wished to impress herself, the city, or\
  \ a charming stranger. \nThe city was compact. Smaller than she expected and not\
  \ as impressive as she had hoped. Having travelled to other European destinations,\
  \ maybe there was nothing that such place could offer her. Baroque came to meet\
  \ Gothic, while simpler renaissance details tie the historical city centre together.\
  \ That was the direction she was heading to, leaving behind neighbourhoods painted\
  \ by communist history. She kept on walking. Steady pace, in her yellow coat, lost\
  \ in the music of a tired playlist. On Sundays all the cafes and bars close early.\
  \ And although she grasped she had little time, she kept looking around to find\
  \ a place that would share its comfort with her. Right then and there, nothing felt\
  \ more comfortable than warm street lights, the empty Hlavn\xE1 (main street) and\
  \ the freedom of a non-planned evening. She took turn after turn, into dark alleys\
  \ and narrow streets, then back to the Main Street and into another lane yet to\
  \ be strolled about. Nothing seemed to provide what she was looking for. Nothing\
  \ but the city itself. \nOnce again she was approaching the historical centre. However,\
  \ this time the street was leading her straight towards the daunting St Elizabeth\u2019\
  s Cathedral. Judged, she felt. For being so unappreciative of what was given to\
  \ her. The sudden and deafening ring of the church bell boosted that feeling of\
  \ guilt. Forced to remove her headset off her ears, she stood there, in the middle\
  \ of a crossroad, looking around in the dark and feeling the bell song shatter away\
  \ every element that kept her trapped into discomfort. When the bell stopped, she\
  \ didn\u2019t feel the need to get lost into her music once more. Instead, she kept\
  \ promenading the paved street. \nHave you ever heard what cold sounds like? Thick\
  \ silence that occupies the space around you. She is dominant, despite the sounds\
  \ that interrupt her. One might listen to the winter breeze whispering to the branches\
  \ of the trees, sharing secrets of the mountains. Or some barely audible chatter\
  \ of people having dinner and beer inside warm pubs around the Hlavn\xE1, were someone\
  \ to walk by them. Fast steps, luggage rolling on the paved street. These were pieces\
  \ of that night\u2019s soundtrack \u2013 thick silence, interrupted by incoherent\
  \ sounds. \nLuggage rolling on the paved street. That one really stood out in her\
  \ ears. After all, it was Sunday night, meaning the time had come for citizens to\
  \ return from their weekend get-away. As life returned to the city, she was reminiscing\
  \ her first days in Ko\u0161ice, the sound of her own rolling suitcase, the burden\
  \ of unpacking. Taking up some other space, needing to find new cosy corners and\
  \ bars to love. Before leaving her hometown, nothing in the world could make her\
  \ believe she would have such hard time to settle in. \nThat scene right there of\
  \ people coming home made her heart feel warmer. Although not drinking chardonnay\
  \ wine at a bar with low lighting, the sound of cold gave her the strength to not\
  \ need home. To be the stranger in a foreign city, embrace the unknown and start\
  \ building anew home. She started living for herself and the heart of Ko\u0161ice\
  \ seemed perfectly fitting for such a lifestyle."
