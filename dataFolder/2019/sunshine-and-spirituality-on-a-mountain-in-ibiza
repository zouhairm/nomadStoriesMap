Text: "This summer I found myself in a place I\u2019m sure many of us know all too\
  \ well, I had just walked away from a job I used to love but had transformed into\
  \ something else altogether.\n\nI found myself drinking wine one evening with my\
  \ parents, happy to be surrounded by their love, and yet feeling completely drained\
  \ by the events of the last few weeks. We discussed what I could do to put myself\
  \ back together again and the possibility of looking into yoga retreats. Several\
  \ glasses of wine later we had decided that a retreat in Ibiza looked the best,\
  \ and within minutes I was booking away, spending all the money I had saved over\
  \ the summer. \n\nThe next day I woke up knowing that I had made the right choice,\
  \ that I was choosing what was best for my body and mind. \n\nVery soon I was in\
  \ a picturesque retreat on top of the Ibizan mountains. I spent the beginning of\
  \ the week soaking up the sunshine, reading my book and enjoying yoga sessions twice\
  \ daily. But there was one thing I dreaded, the meditation. \n\nEvery evening we\
  \ would sit on the rooftop as the sun began to set and meditate. I would look around\
  \ and see everyone blissfully peaceful, crossed legged and, unmoving. I could feel\
  \ myself annoying everyone with my fidgeting but no matter how hard I tried I couldn\u2019\
  t get comfortable. In the end, I gave up most nights and enjoyed watching the sun\
  \ lowering on the horizon or the small cars moving along the road in the distance.\n\
  \nThen one morning we woke up before the sun had fully emerged over the hills below\
  \ and the sky was a dusty purple. We all gathered next to the yoga deck bleary-eyed\
  \ to begin our lesson in walking meditation. I wished at that moment that I had\
  \ stayed in bed watching the sunrise and dreaded being the only one who couldn\u2019\
  t meditate properly. \n\n\nWe were encouraged to walk mindfully around the mountain\
  \ path. We were told to feel every movement our bodies made, to understand if one\
  \ leg was stronger than the other. Walking and moving slowly, lifting each foot\
  \ inch by inch from the ground. \nWe had been told to practice a mantra as we walked\
  \ to help keep our mind from wandering, sa-ta-na-ma, with each step a new sound,\
  \ sa-ta-na-ma. \n\nSa is the beginning, infinity. \n\nTa is life, creativity and\
  \ all that manifests. \n\nNa is transformation, the end of something.\n\nMa is rebirth\
  \ and new beginnings. \nAs I walked on the rubble path around the mountain my mind\
  \ slowly began to clear. The mantras that I chanted rang through my body. With each\
  \ movement, I became more and more aware of my body. I focused on feeling the ground\
  \ below my feet, on releasing all my worries into the earth and connecting myself\
  \ to the earth with every step. \nWalking meditation was so beneficial because rather\
  \ than trying to separate myself from my surroundings, I was recognising my body\
  \ as intrinsically related to the nature around me. \n\n\nThe walking meditation\
  \ seemed to break through my very last doubts about the retreat and I felt myself\
  \ begin to relax and open up to all the beautiful possibilities of my week away.\
  \ \nRealising all the worry I was carrying allowed me to experience the rest of\
  \ the week with no reservations.  The next day, a few women from the retreat and\
  \ I, drove in a rented car to a local beach and spent the day swimming and sunbathing\
  \ in the glorious sunshine. We embraced the Spanish nudity and spent the day only\
  \ in our bikini bottoms and for once in my life, I wasn\u2019t embarrassed, mostly\
  \ because everyone on the beach was equally undressed, but also because I felt comfortable\
  \ in myself. Among these women in the Spanish sunshine, I truly put aside all the\
  \ things that had been holding me back and opened myself up to living completely."
