Text: "This simple verse below captures my mostly spirited experience that was Bhaktapur\
  \ - Kathmandu\u2019s little sister city. The lesson revealed to me was in resilience.\
  \ It resonated with the 20-year old me as I nurtured my own revival. This was during\
  \ a visit in December 2016. Eighteen months following the strike of the earthquake\
  \ at 11:56am on April 25, 2015.\n\nShake after shake, \nQuake after quake\nI will\
  \ get up, \nRe-calibrate\n\nOh how I could feel the resilient spirit of this country.\
  \ In Kathmandu, the rubble had been cleared and all major buildings were restored.\
  \ Boudhanath Stupa had just reopened and it was magnificent. \n\nYet, this concreted\
  \ city was not quite for me. Too busy. I heard there was an insightful old walking\
  \ city nearby that was also quite damaged by the\_7.8 magnitude earthquake. \n\n\
  Moving along from the notorious dust of Kathmandu, I decided to wander over to neighbouring\
  \ sister city, Bhaktapur.\n\nI rode east for an hour on the local bus to arrive\
  \ in the late morning.\_I meandered through a back street happily, while trying\
  \ to savour the last bite of my almost favourite Nepalese food - the vegetable pakora\
  \ (a deep-fried falafel-type pancake). A man in his sixties sat on his rusty stool,\
  \ scooped one-by-one up from the big fryer, placed a paper towel around each, and\
  \ fed his patient regulars. It was a following. Right at the front door of his home.\
  \ I held my pakora up against the sweltering UV rays and took a photo. I stared\
  \ at it in gratitude and continued on.\n\nI was suddenly discontented\_when my feet\
  \ arrived at red rubble. The street led me to were the red brick remains of an old\
  \ pyramidal looking structure with deformed elephant and lion guardians on the front\
  \ pillars. Just 18-months ago it stood tall as the Fasidega\_temple. Now, it barely\
  \ stood. The sword of the 2015 Nepal Earthquake had sliced two-thirds of this grand\
  \ temple that many locals and tourists once frequented. I tried to comprehend the\
  \ heartbreak of the local worshippers, and if they could salvage anything in these\
  \ ruins. Thankfully no lives were lost beneath this temple during the shocks. \_\
  \n\nFasidega temple in Bhaktapur had commenced major rebuild in 2018. I look forward\
  \ to one day, visiting the again spectacular temple. I am in awe of it\u2019s resilience\
  \ and that of Bhaktapur's local worshippers in making it great again."
