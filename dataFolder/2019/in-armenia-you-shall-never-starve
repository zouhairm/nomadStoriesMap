Text: "\u201CIf you were given a chance to see gorgeous mountains higher than the\
  \ Alps and embrace Stalinist-style architecture, would you say no?\u201D asked Alex\
  \ in a rush. It was summer as I sat idly in Hamburg. He just received a response\
  \ from the Chair of Expeditions Committee. Being asked to lead a group of young\
  \ volunteers at the Transcaucasian Trail in Armenia, he soon planned to depart.\n\
  \ \nI thought of a similar place I had been to before, Georgia. A pristine paradise\
  \ of deep valleys and endless vistas stretching across the border to my native Russia\
  \ suddenly evoked engrossing nostalgia. I immediately agreed and the next moment\
  \ we found ourselves in the almost empty departure hall of Hamburg Airport. A rather\
  \ late-night flight from Germany\u2019s Helmut Schmidt Flughafen seemed to be empty\
  \ enough to relax with luxurious extra-legroom and several Armenians chitchatting\
  \ around. However, I could not sleep.\n\nScrolling through outdated magazines, I\
  \ worried about our stay in Armenia. We did need a place to sleep in Yerevan. Deep\
  \ in my heart I would hope for a caring, warm host that truly captures the spirit\
  \ of Airbnb or at least a place at a decent B&B. But just as Armenia was thrilling\
  \ for Alex, so was it for me, too. Both of us were just two audacious travelers,\
  \ - headed towards the mysterious post-Soviet unknown.\n\nFrom the sky Yerevan was\
  \ dimly lit. Once our old Airbus had landed in the dark lands of a night Armenia,\
  \ we entered customs. I picked up our dusty backpacks from a shabby baggage carousel,\
  \ whilst Alex tried to figure out the Armenian roaming data. After some abracadabra\
  \ he announced we have a host address. A woman who lived in the city center of Yerevan\
  \ was a forty-second cousin on his friend\u2019s father\u2019s side. I had no high\
  \ expectations.\n \nOnce we left the airport, we took a cab ride. A driver, an energetic\
  \ young Armenian guy, talked nonstop. I had a feeling of being on the late-night\
  \ radio show. \"In Soviet times, the capital underwent a radical massive facelift\"\
  , the driver enthused. \"Following the architect\u2019s Alexander Tamanyan vision\
  \ the downtown of Yerevan was re-purposed...\" I wondered whether we should reward\
  \ his outstanding tour-guiding abilities in the end of the ride, too. \n\nAfter\
  \ passing the American University of Armenia, he stopped. We faced a multi-storey\
  \ Khruschev-era house with balconies that hanged ghastly from a typical fa\xE7ade.\
  \ The house had no lighting. The elevator groaned eerily as we went up. Soon we\
  \ stood in front of a chipped-paint metal front door. The corridor smelled of fried\
  \ onions. The smell my Grandma usually had reminded me of  a childhood, and seemingly\
  \ neverending joy that can only be found when you visit your old ones. I rang once\
  \ and we waited nervously. Finally the large door opened. I saw Nona.\n \nShort,\
  \ with tiny wrinkles on her cheeks, she was no older than 40. A pitch-back mop of\
  \ hair slightly touched a traditional Armenian shawl spread over her fastidious\
  \ shoulders. She whispered something indolently in English and invited us into the\
  \ house. It was two in the morning. I felt uncomfortable as I realized she had waited\
  \ for us eagerly so far into the night. After walking along a corridor decorated\
  \ with the colourful, variegated carpet \u2013 my Grandma and half of the Soviet\
  \ population had the same \u2013 we entered a small dimly-lit room. Next to the\
  \ neat bed I saw apricot seeds. Armenians believe that this fruit embodies the nature\
  \ of the Armenian Highlands, a birthplace of Indo-European people.\n\nNona gently\
  \ knocked at the door. I heard jingling sound of plates and spoons. \"I brought\
  \ you some pie. It\u2019s not good to sleep with the empty stomach. In Armenia you\
  \ would never starve\", whispered Nona. The next morning we were greeted with even\
  \ more food. The table groaned with freshly brewed coffee and pastry, goat cheese\
  \ and juicy cherries. The very next morning I also found out that Nona\u2019s husband\
  \ had stomach cancer. He laid in bed behind that one kitchen wall, a wall that divided\
  \ starvation from feast. \"In Armenia you would never starve\", whispered Nona again\
  \ and crossed herself."
