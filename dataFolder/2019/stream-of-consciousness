Text: "Every day, there are a hundred things we encounter along with a thousand ideas\
  \ in our head that follow. Most of those ideas, despite the fact that they are on\
  \ auto-pilot and they make us who we are, are often ignored and not given as much\
  \ attention. My travel story is going to circumvent around those ideas and narratives\
  \ and images around me that make me, make people around me who we are. I want to\
  \ tell the tale, not just to my current set of readers in this era, I want to live\
  \ to tell the tale even when I'm gone centuries beyond my death. I want to revel\
  \ deeper into this self-fashioning space to let the readers realize everything we\
  \ do on a daily basis make us heroes, no matter how trivial they may be. \nTo do\
  \ the same, I'm going to pen down narratives, thoughts, images that I capture and\
  \ people that I meet through this journey. A picture tells a story and that's what\
  \ I am going to use as my aid to narrate my tale and the tale of all the people\
  \ I encounter through this trip. My idea is to idolize everybody as the king and\
  \ queen of their own lives- which they are- the master of their soul and destiny,\
  \ but are often left to feel as though they are \"nothing\". I wish to make my readers\
  \ and people in the book feel like they have a bigger role to play despite their\
  \ 9 to 5 jobs, a monotonous household and an ordinary lifestyle- they're all extraordinary\
  \ for how they make others feel around them every single day. I  wish to bring out\
  \ catharsis through this piece of writing."
