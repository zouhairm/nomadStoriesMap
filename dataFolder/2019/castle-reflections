Text: "I hadn\u2019t seen my home country for an entire year, and even before that,\
  \ I had barely stayed long enough to realize that it wasn\u2019t what I had left\
  \ behind, or rather I wasn\u2019t the same person who had left the country in 2013,\
  \ bright-eyed and ready for college.\n\nI visited all 3 castles years after leaving\
  \ the shores of Ghana for undergrad. I had seen them multiple times before leaving,\
  \ but this time, they looked different. Although the stories hadn\u2019t changed,\
  \ my view of them was more intense, more vivid. The stories were not new, but my\
  \ understanding and appreciation of the places had been changed by a clearer view\
  \ of the world.\n\nMy first was the Osu Castle, still looking patriotic although\
  \ the president and his cabinet had moved away. It was no longer that building that\
  \ imposed on me as I ran across the lawn with the other children during a special\
  \ church service on Sunday. It now reflected what its history made it: a prison\
  \ for my people.\n\nThe Cape Coast castle had a more sublime effect on me. The white\
  \ walls had probably seen more torture than most places in the world, but it still\
  \ looked like the beacons of history that they have been. The heads were on the\
  \ ground, molded as they had been to represent the thousands who had wailed within\
  \ those walls. The weather tossed between sunny and rainy, as if unsure of whether\
  \ to mourn the lost souls of the castle or to celebrate that their descendants could\
  \ walk freely about the space when their ancestors had been weighed down by shackles.\n\
  \nAt the Elmina Castle, I perspired while trying to lift the punishment boulder.\
  \ The slaves had been expected to lift it to the sky when they were accused of some\
  \ wrongdoing. I tried to lift it, making it as high as my calves, with sweat dripping\
  \ down my face and hitting the ground that at one time had been soaked with blood\
  \ and feces. I walk on the same grounds that thousands had been chained in, and\
  \ I finally understood the significance."
