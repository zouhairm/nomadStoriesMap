Text: "During the night we had docked in Valpara\xEDso, Chile, one of the first ports\
  \ on the maiden world voyage of the Queen Mary 2.  I was up much earlier than I\
  \ would have liked, but I had to get to the theater to meet my group.  Volunteering\
  \ to escort passenger tours was a great way to get the tour, and sometimes lunch,\
  \ for free.  Usually all that was required was to count heads, possibly carry a\
  \ tour paddle, and occasionally bandage clumsy passengers.  Our tour that day was\
  \ to Vi\xF1amar Winery in the Casablanca Valley.\n\nWine making has a long history\
  \ in South America, first for sacramental uses and later, with the addition of vines\
  \ from France, fine wine making.  Some of the French imports have become so established\
  \ in South America that their French origins have been largely forgotten \u2013\
  \ think of Argentinian Malbec or the heavily tannic Tannat of Uruguay.\n\nI stepped\
  \ off the tour bus into a sunny January day and though it was mid-summer in the\
  \ Southern Hemisphere, it wasn\u2019t hot due to a cool breeze coming in off the\
  \ ocean.  That breeze, from the cold Humboldt Current flowing north along the coast\
  \ from Antarctica, helps the grapes ripen more slowly and fully, and maintains their\
  \ acidity which is a definite asset when making wine.  I paused and gazed out at\
  \ precise rows of wire trellises weighed down by vines at the height of their summer\
  \ growth.  Under an almost cloudless sky these rows spread across the valley until\
  \ they were interrupted by the foothills of the Coastal Range.  My reverie was soon\
  \ intruded upon as it was time for our tour of the winery and tasting room.  Susan,\
  \ the American intern who was running our tasting, introduced us to the winery\u2019\
  s selections, then brought out a bottle of red wine from an affiliate in Maipo Valley\
  \ and told a very interesting story.\n\nThe tale she shared began in the second\
  \ half of the 19th century.  Phylloxera, an aphid-like invasive species from the\
  \ Americas, had spread through the vineyards of Europe feeding on the roots, weakening\
  \ them, and causing the vines to wither.  Despite its historic role as one of Bordeaux\u2019\
  s core blending grapes, Carm\xE9n\xE8re had a finicky reputation and as vineyards\
  \ were replanted, Carm\xE9n\xE8re was left aside.  Years passed and the common thought\
  \ was that the grape had gone extinct and was lost to history.  Over a century later,\
  \ the Chileans wondered why their Merlot wines were off and unlike any Merlot they\u2019\
  d had.  So, in 1994 a French expert was brought in who determined that the Merlot\
  \ fields were a mix of earlier ripening Merlot and later ripening Carm\xE9n\xE8\
  re which made for an odd tasting wine.  The name Carm\xE9n\xE8re is thought to originate\
  \ from the French word for crimson because the grape leaves turn bright red in the\
  \ fall, and since Merlot\u2019s do not, this could have been a clue to their differences.\
  \  The vines were then separated, the Merlot improved and the rediscovered Carm\xE9\
  n\xE8re became forever linked to Chile.\n\nI fell in love with Carm\xE9n\xE8re.\
  \  A cousin of Cabernet Sauvignon, it\u2019s made into a dark red, medium-bodied\
  \ wine that, depending on where it\u2019s grown, has flavors of black plum, raspberry,\
  \ chocolate, and pepper (sometimes green bell, sometimes cracked black).  But beyond\
  \ the flavor, I fell in love with the story.  It intrigued me.  Perhaps, too, the\
  \ mild intoxication I was feeling was the result of traveling to a Chilean vineyard,\
  \ of being so far outside the usual me, or maybe it was simply because of the wine\
  \ tasting itself.  All I knew was that I was having a personal eureka moment that\
  \ my life could be different.  Later I would take wine classes, earn wine certifications\
  \ and find employment in the wine industry.  For the moment, however, these future\
  \ life changes would wait as I half smiled, half smirked to myself, shouldered my\
  \ daypack filled with bottles of Carm\xE9n\xE8re and smuggled them up the crew gangplank."
