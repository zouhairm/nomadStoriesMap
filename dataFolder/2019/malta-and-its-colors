Text: "In October of last year, I decided to travel with my camera to a country made\
  \ up of an archipelago located in the center of the Mediterranean Sea in southern\
  \ Italy, this country is Malta. I had an interest in being there, for the landscapes,\
  \ the islands, places declared as heritage of humanity, animals and especially for\
  \ listening to the sound of the waves of the Mediterranean. Malta is an island that\
  \ dresses in colors every day, but without a doubt my favorite colors are: sunrise\
  \ and sunset.\nOne day I was walking along the seafront of Sliema, I can not describe\
  \ the peace and tranquility that I felt at that moment with the sounds that the\
  \ waves of the sea on that rocky beach, I could see one of the most beautiful sunsets,\
  \ I saw the horizon, while the sun was hiding, meanwhile in the middle of two yachts\
  \ that I could see from afar, the moon appeared, at the beginning I did not know\
  \ what was so bright in the middle of those yachts, but as the seconds passed I\
  \ could see that It was the moon !! ... I was fascinated with what I was seeing\
  \ at that moment and as the moon continued to ascend from the view I had of the\
  \ horizon of the Mediterranean, it was getting dark and I could feel the calm sea,\
  \ undoubtedly the best thirty minutes of my life sitting in one of the natural pools\
  \ of Sliema.One day, I saw some green houses with blankets inside plastic covers\
  \ to protect their interior, large and clean to be garbage. There was no sign of\
  \ anyone or activity around him. What would that do? I thought about it daily while\
  \ walking around there.\n\nOne day in the afternoon I found this panorama: the cats,\
  \ the blankets, the feeders and the drinking troughs. How had the cats managed to\
  \ reach this state? Is someone busy collecting everything at the end of the day?\
  \ That there was some organization was clear because, at dusk, there was no trace\
  \ of cats or their comforts. So I investigated. \"Yes, there is a gentleman who\
  \ takes care of them. Everyone knows him as \"the catman\" and goes down daily to\
  \ take care of the animals. He feeds them, he takes out the blankets ... And then\
  \ he comes back to keep everything. So every day. People help him, give him money\
  \ to buy them, I think. It's true, you see him buying food at the supermarket. There\
  \ is another curious cat village located in Paceville, Here the animals live among\
  \ stuffed animals of elephants, lions, monkeys, panda bears and octopuses. For being\
  \ there is up to \"Piolin\", who I doubt that he feels calm between so much cute\
  \ kitten. They have very nice wooden houses, every time I decided to walk there,\
  \ I stopped to photograph them, the cats were adorable, fat and they posed for photos,\
  \ and you can see it in my photos!\nAs for beaches in the area there is one of sand\
  \ in St Julians. And there are also in Sliema several rocky areas where people bathe,\
  \ as it is enabled for bathing and multiple natural pools.\n\nFrom the area of \u200B\
  \u200Bthe Sliema Ferries, you can enjoy stunning views of La Valletta, located on\
  \ a peninsula surrounded by two ports, the Grand Harbor and the Marsamxett. It is\
  \ surrounded by the remains of a great wall that defended the city centuries ago.\
  \ It is a very small city, less than 2 km long. Many of its narrow streets are long\
  \ slopes and steep stairs. The city, is walking without any problem walking. In\
  \ the Barracca Gardens you can see impressive views of the 3 cities, Senglea, Copiscua\
  \ and Vittoriosa; separated by sea.\n\nI would definitely go back to Malta!"
