Text: "The place where nature meets people and lava meets glaciers. The real definition\
  \ of nature and its mesmerizing beauty can only be found in Iceland.\n\nIn my journey\
  \ around the world, Iceland is one of those amazing destinations which I won't be\
  \ tired of recommending to others. It's counted among one of those dream destinations\
  \ which people think to travel at least once in their lifetime. I still remember\
  \ the first sight of Iceland and it was so pleasing and exciting. Iceland was my\
  \ 50th destination and I feel so happy to hit the half-century with such an amazing\
  \ and surprising destination.  Iceland is a destination where you would like to\
  \ take your family for a wow experience. It comes under one of the safest countries\
  \ in the world and an expensive country to visit. The currency is Icelandic Krona.\
  \ \n\nThere's an interesting controversy between Greenland and Iceland, which amazed\
  \ many travelers; even me, that is- in spite of the name Iceland, it mainly consists\
  \ of greenery whereas Greenland is completely covered with ice. \n\nWater in Iceland\
  \ is completely portable as it comes right beneath the earth's surface. Though smells\
  \ like rotten eggs there's ample source of water. Icelandic people and many scientists\
  \ believe that their water is very pure and good for a healthy body and also helps\
  \ to recover fast from injuries and diseases.\n\nStarting right from the Keflavik\
  \ International Airport and driving towards the city, you will find  lava fields\
  \ on both sides of the highway and it really looks stunning on a bright sunny day\
  \ when the glare of the sun falls on these fields of big chunks of lava rocks, tempting\
  \ them to shine and give a magnificent welcome to visitors. \n\nThe lifetime experience\
  \ at Blue lagoon will always be one of your memorable moment forever and I mean\
  \ it. Visiting Iceland and missing out Blue Lagoon is really not acceptable. The\
  \ warm bluey waters surrounded by artistic vapors will invite you for a nice relaxation\
  \ time followed by silica mud mask which takes care of your beautiful face while\
  \ you relax enjoying the picturesque mountains with your favorite drink in hand.\n\
  \nI really enjoyed exploring the glittering ice caves and dark lava tunnel which\
  \ I would also recommend you to make your trip more interesting. The Hallgrimskirkja\
  \ church... I was so delighted seeing such a piece of architecture. The Sun Voyager\
  \ and its historical stories during the Viking period really amazed me. I was so\
  \ happy to see an erupting Geysir which erupts at every 5mins of an interval.\n\n\
  Iceland and its natural beauty couldn't be compared with any other countries. It\
  \ serves visitors with the best art of nature. Undoubtedly, this wonderful country\
  \ has really paved its way to my heart. This trip would always be one of my best\
  \ memories and recommended trip ever. \n\nThe destination which has become a dream\
  \ for most photographers to capture the dancing Aurora in the heavenly skies, a\
  \ dream of most nomads and traveler to experience the beautiful nature with their\
  \ very own eyes and last but not the least, the destination really received its\
  \ appropriate name \"The Land of Fire and Ice\". Iceland is one of those destinations\
  \ where you would like to go for a wow experience and one of the chosen destinations\
  \ to spend time with family."
