Text: "I never went to the nations. Nations always came to me. What define a nation\
  \ it's not territory, but people. We have this idea that land is the biggest border\
  \ between people, so we configured maps to limit territory, have international laws\
  \ to protect peace and what land can economic provide. But all of us forget that\
  \ the most important from land is what ends in a table.\n  I was invited for a Paquistanish\
  \ table in my hometown. It was at a shantytown, nearby. There lives four men who\
  \ was trying to left war behind. In respect, I wear long clothes, but cannot hide\
  \ in such clothes how amazed I was to know someone so different. I was there because\
  \ a friend was dating one of them.\n  When I stepped at room, it smells flour and\
  \ spicy, of course. They introduced themselves and said to have a sit on the floor.\
  \ I learned that a table is not made of wood, a table is made of eyes who talk.\
  \ Them they started to ask questions about my life. As long as they felt atmosphere\
  \ lightly growing, started to give me permission to ask. I asked for their family\
  \ and histories, dreams and fears. While they spreached I could hear bombs and screams\
  \ trough the window, kids being raped, families apart, shame, pain, anxiety and\
  \ the last breath of Lathika, dearest wife... It was war in a home. For some minutes\
  \ my heart was in Paquistan, that room was Paquistan soil, my blood was flushing\
  \ with my brothers.\n  They unrolled a straw rug and lunch was served. \"Roti\"\
  \ (kind of bread) with spicy tomatoes sauce. It really need a glass of water for\
  \ every bite or you will feel the chains of hell dancing in your tongue, but they\
  \ just call it pepper. I asked to learn how to do \"chay\" (black tea with caramelized\
  \ sugar and milk), it was very funny because for \"lala\" (big brother) it's almost\
  \ a sacred recipe and he tells it with a lot of details.\n  Them music started!\
  \ I was taking belly dancing classes, so we danced together without shame, I even\
  \ knew some songs (for their delight). A family in Paquistan, with songs, coloured\
  \ tunics and laughs. It was a proper embassy. We were all the same! And then I said\
  \ goodbye...\n  I felt the fear, the joy, the taste, the smell and the mourning\
  \ of a nation by listening to it's people. Words can erase borders and oceans. A\
  \ table shows more than places. Eyes can connect more than WI-FI. Blood, not places.\
  \ That's the real treasure."
