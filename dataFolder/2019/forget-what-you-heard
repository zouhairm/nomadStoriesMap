Text: "It was around the end of monsoon season. I\u2019d been in India for three days\
  \ and only crept the noisy streets near my guesthouse. The northern sky was black\
  \ with storm clouds but I needed an excursion. Like the status quo in Vancouver,\
  \ I left my iPhone behind in the room for the adventure of seeing Mumbai. I recalled\
  \ the refrain, \u201Cnever go anywhere without your passport\u201D, so I hung the\
  \ pouch around my neck, stuffed it down my waterproof shorts, and walked.\nAfter\
  \ a while, I found the Metro. An attendant told me, \u201CGo to the last stop to\
  \ see some interesting things\u201D. On the road below the last Metro station, there\
  \ were three ways to go; left, right, and straight. The slum to my right convinced\
  \ me to go straight and follow the alignment of the elevated Metro. \nAbout an hour\
  \ of enthusiastic walking passed. The tableau had melded into every clich\xE9 of\
  \ Indian cities shown in media; carts, cows, tuk tuks, street urchins, beggars,\
  \ decayed buildings, incessantly blaring car horns, and no tourist attractions in\
  \ sight. With my head down I shed my dignity, and lost my way.\nAs I walked, the\
  \ rain intensified. When I saw modern colorfully-lit signs, I thought I was getting\
  \ to trendy streets but behind the bright lights were dingy shops and unhygienic-looking\
  \ restaurants. Amongst the spoils of a forgotten world, I felt like I was on assignment\
  \ with National Geographic. \nWhen I reached a long bridge, which connected two\
  \ areas of the city, I was in a monsoon, my feet in water flowing over the sidewalk.\
  \ I muttered to myself that this wasn\u2019t right and I didn\u2019t know where\
  \ I was going. I figured a right turn onto the bridge might take me into less murky\
  \ waters. I passed dozens of low-slung lean-tos that covered raggedly-clothed people\
  \ on the wide sidewalk, I thought they were poor merchants, but they had nothing\
  \ to sell. I looked beyond the lean-tos to my right and, seeing a slum beside the\
  \ river below, realized the bridge people were outcasts who didn\u2019t qualify\
  \ for a home down there. The adults were preoccupied with survival, a toddler plodded\
  \ blank-faced to the edge of a shelter to see nothing there. I went unseen, a ghost\
  \ in Lululemon and Arcteryx observing the wretched.\nThere were no good signs ahead.\
  \ The apparent endless decay resigned me to stay on that side and find a train back.\
  \ In my panic, I recalled the exceptionally white legs I\u2019d seen earlier. It\
  \ was a bespectacled ginger man deep under an umbrella. I assumed naively he was\
  \ in Mumbai for some altruistic reason. It was too late, but I should have tried\
  \ him for directions. Furthermore, those legs were possibly close to an area where\
  \ tourists go. But bravado often translates to foolhardiness, and it kept me from\
  \ an easier route.\nAfter several tries, I found a security guard with faint English\
  \ and got reasonable directions to a train that would take me back to the Chembur\
  \ colony. \nDirections procured at the train station took me several stops and kilometers\
  \ too far. But the storm had stopped. \nI walked through the narrow, dimly-lit dirt\
  \ streets of a bustling Muslim community, felt I was getting lost again, and doubled\
  \ back over the tracks. I went a short distance on the other side to find a vibrant\
  \ walking street with remodeled shops, restaurants and hundreds of Friday night\
  \ revelers, families in traditional Muslim attire, and a few tourists. I enjoyed\
  \ wandering until my clothes were dry then found someone to get me an Uber. \nBack\
  \ in the bungalow I discovered the prolonged condensation in my shorts saturated\
  \ the edges of my passport. Under the laminate, ink bled over my photo obscuring\
  \ my face. I had to surrender the passport to the Canadian Consulate, get a replacement,\
  \ and apply for an exit permit to leave the country. \nAlmost four months later,\
  \ I was satisfied to leave New Delhi with what I went to India for; I saw beauty\
  \ in things not so glossy, I learned true patience\u2026 and to appreciate life\
  \ wherever I am."
