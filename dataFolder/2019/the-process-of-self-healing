Text: "An unexpected trip to Rishikesh-India.\nRishikesh is the yoga capital of the\
  \ world,and I without knowing that went there just to experience Rafting.\nI reached\
  \ there 5:00 am morning and the weather there took me in it\u2019s arms.I was tired\
  \ traveling 7 hours straight by a local bus but I got so relaxed by just being there.\n\
  The wind,mountains and the voice of flowing water took away all my tiredness and\
  \ I was all fresh and ready to explore.\nI had my morning tea at a stall there and\
  \ then went straight to the Ghat.\nI reached the Ghat and sat there for 2 hours\
  \ thinking of limitless boundaries.\nThe water so clear,the air so fresh and the\
  \ scenario so pure made me wonder why I wasn\u2019t born here,that\u2019s all I\
  \ wanted to know and then I realised the baggage that I carry with myself about\
  \ a lost of things say existential crisis is too much and then I started to think\
  \ about my life and it felt feeling light as if I threw my baggage in the flowing\
  \ water.I was calmed and relaxed and then sun rays started to hit me so I got up\
  \ and went to my hotel.\nI tried to sleep but couldn\u2019t thinking of how light\
  \ I feel and how blessed my life is.\nThen later that day I went exploring the shops,markets\
  \ and the ghar Aarti.\nLater that night ,I had the most peaceful sleep of my life.\n\
  I woke up fresh in the morning to experience what I had come for RAFTING.\nI went\
  \ rafting and what an what an amazing experience it was. I was thrilled and mesmerised.\n\
  The water surely has healing powers.\nThen somebody asked me there if I wanted to\
  \ for a 2 day yoga session and I immediately agreed.\nI went to the ashram that\
  \ was literally in the lap of nature.\nI had the time to think about so much related\
  \ to my life ,I contemplated and I felt like a better person.\nYoga and Rishikesh\
  \ have trueky changed me as a person.\nI recommend everybody to have this experience\
  \ once in a lifetime also the 5 day trip just costed my 8000INR which is very very\
  \ budget friendly.\nThe food and ambience is truely stunning.\nNature has made me\
  \ learn so much.\nThankyou Rishikesh\u2665\uFE0F"
