Text: "It is hot, and I\u2019ve already drained half my water.  I should have rationed\
  \ it out more carefully, but reason had yielded to need.  Samuel, my guide, wearing\
  \ sandals and a gray, wide-brimmed hat, appears unaffected; the uphill grind is\
  \ easy for him.  He shares a bit of his family history.  His grandparents had escaped\
  \ the reach of the Reich and made a home in England, and Samuel had found love and\
  \ peace in Israel.  He is expecting his first child.\n\tNearing the summit of Mount\
  \ Bental in the Golan Heights, we pass three Humvees.  Ahead of us, a troop of IDF\
  \ soldiers march upward, their weapons in open view.  It is a reminder of how volatile\
  \ the Middle East is.  I return my gaze to Samuel.  A question forms on the tip\
  \ of my tongue. \n\tThe ground shakes and a deafening wave rumbles over us.  My\
  \ question immediately changes. \n\t\u201CWhat was that?\u201D  Samuel pauses.\n\
  \t\u201CThe Syrian Civil War,\u201D comes his solemn reply.  \n\tStunned, I just\
  \ stare at him.  He turns away and continues the trek up the mountain.  I will my\
  \ feet to continue onward, my mind swirls with the reality of what the war would\
  \ look like.  Would I be able to see it?  The horrors?  \n      Another explosion\
  \ quickens my pace.  I catch up to Samuel and match his long strides.  The weight\
  \ of the war deadens the physical discomfort of the hike.  My mouth dry, I take\
  \ another gulp of water.  \n       \u201CYou should conserve that,\u201D Ofir, our\
  \ assigned security guard, says.  He is a former IDF medic.  He carries a pistol\
  \ on his hip, yet another reminder.  The Israeli is a few years younger than me,\
  \ and one look into his dark eyes shows me he had seen and experienced things he\
  \ wished he hadn\u2019t.  Admirably, he fights for joy in every moment, smiles often,\
  \ and hopes to tour southern Asia after he had saved up enough.  His eye is set\
  \ on the beauty of Vietnam.  \n      Taking his advice, I snap the bladder hose\
  \ back onto my backpack and continue the climb.  The wide path levels out as we\
  \ near the top.  One hundred meters ahead, cut into the earth, an Israeli lookout\
  \ post remains from a war fought decades ago.  Yossi, our driver, waits at the base\
  \ of the mountain.  He had fought in that war.  He drove an armored personnel carrier\
  \ in the Yom Kippur War.  In fact, just about everyone I had met thus far had fought\
  \ in one war or another. \n       \u201CWho are they?\u201D I ask, referring to\
  \ the two uniformed men standing at the edge of the lookout.  Samuel follows my\
  \ gaze. \n       \u201CThey are from the UN, keeping an eye on things,\u201D he\
  \ replies.  \nSamuel stops, and we look out over the Valley of Tears, Quneitra,\
  \ New Quneitra, and the sprawling, bleak desert.  An Israeli community, known as\
  \ a kibbutz, resides in the valley, its green farmland in stark contrast to the\
  \ Syrian sand.  Quneitra, a small town controlled by Al Qaeda, sits on the other\
  \ side of the border, and New Quneitra, a larger city controlled by Syrian President\
  \ Bashar al-Assad\u2019s forces, looms just north, not twenty miles.\n      The\
  \ quick rat-ta-tat-tat of machine gun fire rises from the desert cities.  The only\
  \ things we can\u2019t hear are the screams of men, women, and children who no doubt\
  \ perish.  My imagination fills in the gap.\nSamuel begins about the Six-Day War\
  \ and the Yom Kippur War, but another explosion interrupts him.  He apologizes,\
  \ visibly shaken.  A plume of smoke rises in the distance.  \n     \u201CIs it always\
  \ like this?\u201D I ask.  Samuel shakes his head.  \n     \u201CNo,\u201D he replies.\
  \  He takes a minute, asks if he should continue.  I nod, and he does.  I try to\
  \ listen, but the gunfire steals my attention.  I\u2019m drawn to the desert, to\
  \ help in some way, knowing I can\u2019t.  \n     \u201CTake some time to look around,\u201D\
  \ Samuel says.  Did he finish?  My mouth is dry again.  I go for a drink.  Nothing.\
  \  Did I drink it all?  I can\u2019t remember, lost as I am in the tragedy before\
  \ me.  My water is gone, as is my hope for their future."
