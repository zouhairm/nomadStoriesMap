Text: "Every time that I post a #tbt photo of the Atacama desert on my personal Instagram\
  \ profile, it gets much less likes than my silly selfies. Since I'm neither an awful\
  \ photographer nor a supermodel, I didn't have an easy explanation for that. I spent\
  \ a lot of time trying to understand why my family and friends weren't big fans\
  \ of those landscapes that took my breath away. Recently, I think a finally got\
  \ it: our minds just can convey the magnitude of the desert unless you're there.\
  \ \n\nLocated west of the Andes mountains, the Atacama desert it's a plateau that\
  \ stretches through a 1000-km strip on the Pacific coast of South America. The most\
  \ common way to get there is flying to Calama - a 147,000 people city in northern\
  \ Chile - and driving for an hour and a half until you get to San Pedro de Atacama\
  \ - the commune in the desert's heart. The Licancabur volcano towers over the city,\
  \ the desert, the Andes, and marks the Bolivian border, 33 kilometres away.\n\n\
  As soon as my best friend and I landed in Calama we got a holy-mother-we-are-in-the-middle-of-nowhere-with-no-surviving-skills-whatsoever\
  \ feeling. But San Pedro de Atacama has plenty of travel agencies, hotels, and hostels\
  \ to make a traveller's life easier. You can walk around the sandy streets researching\
  \ the available options, choose a travel agency and select the tours  - which have\
  \ to happen in a certain order to avoid altitude sickness. Once that's settled,\
  \ all you have to do is get your sunscreen and nasal decongestants ready for an\
  \ adventure at the driest place on Earth. \n\nOver that week, we saw multi colored\
  \ mountains that looked like sleeping dinosaurs at Valle del Arcoiris and felt like\
  \ we were actually on the moon surface at Valle de la Luna, watching an unbelievably\
  \ pink sunset. We took endless pictures of green and blue lagoons, sometimes surrounded\
  \ by other tourists, like at Piedras Rojas, or completely isolated from anyone else,\
  \ at Salar de \xC1guas Calientes. \n\nWe woke up much earlier than the sunrise to\
  \ watch boiling water sprouting from the volcanic ground at the geyser El Tatio\
  \ and went to sleep looking at the infinite stars of the Universe - the Atacama\
  \ desert has one of the clearest views of the night sky in the world. We rode on\
  \ the vastness of Salar de Tara, with no roads to guide us and not a soul in sight.\
  \ We floated effortlessly at the Lagunas Escondidas - saltier, more dense and more\
  \ lifeless than the Dead Sea. At last, we relaxed in the warm thermal waters of\
  \ the Puritama hot springs, in a well-deserved resting day.\n\nWe knew from the\
  \ beginning this trip would be something to remember. If not for anything else,\
  \ because it was us: two best friends travelling together, eating, drinking, and\
  \ meeting new people. Our surprise was how much we loved it and how much it changed\
  \ us. \n\nSeeing such enormous, untouched places makes you think about how much\
  \ the planet has changed in these brief 350,000 years that humans have roamed the\
  \ Earth. It makes you think about how tiny we are, how much us, these tiny creatures,\
  \ have accomplished, and how easily we can destroy magnificent things. \n\nWhat\
  \ I realised in my Instagram insight was that, before this trip, I had also not\
  \ been able to comprehend how big, bright, and far away the elements in the photos\
  \ of the Atacama desert really were. Even those pictures way better than mine, taken\
  \ by professional photographers could not capture it. There, you get to have a peek\
  \ at how our planet was millions of years ago. It's just too much for the scales\
  \ our brains are used to. After years kind of knowing a what a place looked like\
  \ before I got there, at the desert I was surprised to rediscover my love for travelling\
  \ in its most primitive aspect: seeing places with my own eyes and only then really\
  \ getting to know them."
