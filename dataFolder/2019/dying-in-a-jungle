Text: "On a journey to Guatemala, perhaps the thing I least expected to find was the\
  \ chance for a broken soul to fortuitously mend itself back together.  With the\
  \ passage of time, rather than becoming a footnote in memory, Guatemala has become\
  \ more captivating and mysterious than ever before.  \n\nI was eighteen and wanting\
  \ to die.  I cared for nothing, not even my own well-being, and in a last-ditch\
  \ attempt at something worthwhile, exhausted my finances for something new.  Like\
  \ so many nights before, I lay awake in the darkness of my first Guatemalan night.\
  \  This time, however, differed greatly, as I did not know the life a jungle embraces\
  \ when the sun hides; a constant bombardment of monkey cackles and bird coos.  \n\
  \nSomehow, in a haze of depression, I had traveled to some storybook land thousands\
  \ of miles from home.  For the first time in months, when all reason suggested I\
  \ be dazed and exhausted, I was more awake than ever.  Hidden in a remote village\
  \ in Guatemala, I not only learned how to survive in the jungle but how to survive\
  \ with thoughts of suicide.  \n\nAfter my sleepless initiation to this foreign land,\
  \ I traveled to Flores; a city with a subtle beauty that intrigues rather than impresses.\
  \  While initially interested in the colorful island, I quickly felt exhausted from\
  \ the tranquil sightseeing and mid-day meal.  I wished to instead surrender to my\
  \ demons in the glow of a hotel television.  As the hours ensued, while wasting\
  \ away my trip, I was interrupted by the sharp knock of my host, Anne.\n\n\"My husband...\
  \ Enrique... his mother died.  I won't be able to provide your dinner\" she informed.\
  \  Impulsively, I asked about the funeral.  Walking away, she somberly replied,\
  \ \"In the morning.\"\n\nSurprising myself, I offered to join.\n\nAs an unanticipated\
  \ American guest, I paid my respects to the deceased woman, along with the handful\
  \ of native mourners.  It was there, in a dilapidated rainforest graveyard, I began\
  \ to earnestly ponder the reality of death and life.  \n\nIn the end, we all die,\
  \ regardless of how we lived; that afternoon was my first revelation of this inevitable\
  \ fate.  It was only then did I see the beauty of tropical trees, hand-painted houses,\
  \ and black bean tacos.  \n\nDays later, having pondered the worth of choosing life,\
  \ my new friend Humberto and I hiked a rugged trail to the lookout of a river delta.\
  \  \"There are many crocodiles down there,\" said my guide, pointing at the water's\
  \ glass-like surface.  \"Don't get too close, unless you don't want to live,\" he\
  \ said with a smile, as if he knew the thoughts which had long plagued my mind.\n\
  \nAs we hiked from our perch above, we were stopped by a haunting feeling upon the\
  \ sound of a dreadful purr.  We turned, slowly, to find we were not only being followed\
  \ but were being hunted by a jaguar.\n\n\u201CSe\xF1or, you move down the mountain,\
  \ I\u2019ll hold him off,\u201D urged my now guardian angel.  He whipped out his\
  \ machete, ready to duel like a gladiator in battle.  I did as was told and wished\
  \ him luck.  \n\nThe minutes rolled into what seemed like days as I waited to hear\
  \ the blood-curdling cry of a slaughtered Mayan warrior.  Moments later, relief\
  \ overwhelmed my body as my protector emerged, unbothered and unscathed, as he had\
  \ casually scared off the wild beast.  \n\nI had now looked death in the eye and\
  \ knew I wanted to live. \n\nWhen the conclusion of my adventure approached, I took\
  \ a dim morning hike to find myself standing on a centuries-old temple, high above\
  \ the forest canopy.  As the new day\u2019s sun burned away the fog of dawn, I pondered\
  \ every moment that led me to such a scene.  Enthralled by the mystery of Tikal,\
  \ I thought to myself, \u201CHave I ever really lived until this moment?\u201D\n\
  \nPart of me died in that jungle; the fear of living was replaced with joy, passion,\
  \ and curiosity.  It\u2019s not the first place I imagined, but Guatemala, with\
  \ its vibrant culture and exotic landscape, brought the best part of me back from\
  \ the depths of a suicidal mind.  \n\nDying in a jungle; I was never more alive."
