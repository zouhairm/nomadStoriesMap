Text: "''Home, it is nice to be back!'', I pondered to myself as I gazed out the window.\
  \ The van cruised through concrete roads bordered by old mango trees, green rice\
  \ paddies and tall coconut trees. Infrequently, the pristine view would be blocked\
  \ by huge political or advertisement banners, but I was too excited to let the sporadic\
  \ growth gall over my love for Siargao. Two months since I left the island with\
  \ a beaten ego after Jing told me that there were no weak surfers.\n\n\u2018\u2019\
  Jing\u2019s Place!\u2019\u2019, the van driver declared as he handed over my backpack.\
  \ Jing owned one of the first fully all local homestays in General Luna. Already\
  \ in his fifties, he was still rocking surfer abs. A surfing legend to most, he\
  \ was the surfer dad that I never had.\n\nI marched into the homestay, Jojo welcomed\
  \ me, \u2018\u2019You're home Paula! Let\u2019s go surfing! Uncle Jing is already\
  \ at Secret Spot.\u2019\u2019 Itching to surf again, I speedily unpacked my bag\
  \ onto the bed to change. I clutched my favourite 8-foot long board and strapped\
  \ it to onto the motorbike board rack. I sensed a bit of'self-doubt and worry raced\
  \ in, ''Was it soon too to surf again after a bad reef cut?'', I questioned myself.\
  \ ''You have booties on Paula.'', I reassured myself as I revved the motorbike engine.\n\
  \nForty-five minutes until I reached the not-so-secret Secret Spot because of the\
  \ countless motorbikes parked along the roadside. I wandered 300 meters from the\
  \ parking before I finally heard the rustling waves.\n\nWith a waxed surfboard and\
  \ a Zinc cream covered face, I got on the board and paddled out. \u2018\u2019Nice\
  \ to see you again Tin!\u2019\u2019, jested Jing as he summoned his student over.\
  \ I felt great to be in the water again after having been partially immobile for\
  \ a full month after a minor surfing accident.\n\nThe first wave arrived, I attempted\
  \ to seize it but missed then struggled to get back on the board. As the sun rays\
  \ radiated stronger, so did my impatience. The only reason I signed up for the gym\
  \ was to surf better. Yet there I was plopping miserably like an absolute amateur.\
  \ It felt like a flashback from when I first arrived at the island in 2016, a total\
  \ wreck who lost her job with a failing relationship that wanted nothing but to\
  \ escape reality. Nothing was going right.\n\nWith jelly arms, annoyance grew as\
  \ I waited for waves. I had to deal with my inner demons called patience and trust.\
  \ I turned to Jing seeking assurance of which he responded with a smile.\n\nSurfing\
  \ is definitely not for people who loved full control, there are just too many external\
  \ factors to this sport. The sense of helplessness slowly crept into my nerves being\
  \ a person who relished in predictability.\n\n\u2018\u2019Yew!\u2019\u2019, jeered\
  \ one local surfer as another set of waves showed up over the horizon. Keep legs\
  \ together, paddle deeper with clasped hands, wait for the push, stand up with knees\
  \ bent and look far towards the shore, I told myself.\n\n\u2018\u2019This one Tin!\
  \ Paddle now, paddle hard!\u2019\u2019, coaxed Jing. I paddled, I felt the push\
  \ and the flow got to me. With a sigh of relief, I finally caught a wave, my first\
  \ long ride after a long time. The next hours, I rode one wave after the other with\
  \ much enthusiasm until I could not paddle anymore.\n\n\u2018\u2019Good session\
  \ today! Great to have you back again Tin.\u2019\u2019, said Jing as he patted my\
  \ right shoulder as I looked at him with a stoked face. I felt elated that he was\
  \ proud of me, but I was just happy to be back and ride the tides again.\n\nA supportive\
  \ surfing family living on a gorgeous island also struggling to find balance over\
  \ contentment and growth. ''Progress over perfection, be ready to ride the tides.'',\
  \ Jing would constantly quip. The Siargaonons and the island not only taught me\
  \ acceptance over my flaws but also of trusting life despite the unwanted changes.\n\
  \nAs I turned the engine off and laid the board on the rack, there was a sense of\
  \ peace and security, the very essence of home."
