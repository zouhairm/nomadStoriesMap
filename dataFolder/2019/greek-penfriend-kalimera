Text: "When I was 16 years old, internet was not an option. In 1996, there was a Center\
  \ in Europe (maybe Denmark or Norway, I don't remember) that made \"penfriends\"\
  , friends that send letters to each other without knowing the other person. \n\n\
  I am brazilian but I borned with a huge mega blaster love to Greece with no reason.\
  \ So, when my mom said that I could make a friend around the world by writing letters,\
  \ it was a dream come true.\n\nI sent one dollar in a letter asking for a girl friend,\
  \ my age, from Greece. Maybe a month later, I received a letter with Amanda address\
  \ and soon we began to write letters to each other.\n\nWe send so many letters!\
  \ About our teenager life, vacations, parents and our caotic love life. When email\
  \ were common and internet was at my home, we still decided to send letters. Full\
  \ of gifts to each other, my home is full of souvenirs and postcards from Greece\
  \ and lovely Greek Islands.\n\nTime went by and in 2013 ( 17 years after our first\
  \ letter), I had vacations with my  boyfriend and we decided to go to Athens and\
  \ visit Amanda.\n\nI sent her my flight information, but I did not have her phone\
  \ to call her if something was wrong with my flight. My boyfriend just said: \"\
  are you sure she is going to pick us up at the airport?\" and I answered \"I know\
  \ this with all my heart\".\n\nAfter almost 20 hours flight from Rio de Janeiro\
  \ to Athens, 17 years writing letters, I was there..in Greece! My heart was full\
  \ of joy and happiness when I saw the greek letters while we were waiting the luggage\
  \ to come.\n\nWhen the luggage was ok, we went out to the public area in Airport..\
  \ suddenly a lovely girl with brown hair, green eyes and a hat shouted \" Pati,\
  \ it's you! I am so happy you came to Athens. Let's go home. It is your home here\
  \ in Greece\"\n\nI guess that we hugged for 5 or 10 minutes, I don't remember. My\
  \ boyfriend was in charge with my luggage and we went to her father's car, who was\
  \ waiting for us. Amanda could speak great english, but all her family could not\
  \ and for any second, it was a problem.\n\nWhen her mother saw me, a greek mother\
  \ called Sonia, at her home, she gave me a big hug with lovely smile \" Patricia!\"\
  . \n\nIt was 5 days with Amanda and her family. Athens was so special with her all\
  \ the time. We went together to Partenon, Greek Museum and to her summer home in\
  \ Sunion. I learned that portuguese is much closer to greek language than I could\
  \ ever thought. I had the most fascinating food of this world (In my heart, brazilian\
  \ food and greek food are in first place together.)\n\nWhile I was thinking which\
  \ Island I should visit, I asked her \"Which Island is your favorite?\" and she\
  \ said \" There are lots of Greek Island you should go, but go to Santorini first\"\
  .\n\nSantorini! And we had a 45 minutes flight from Athens to Santorini. When we\
  \ arrived, I was crying. That feeling that mixes joy, happiness and a extreme gratitude.\
  \ Since that day, Santorini is my favorite Island in this planet (Sardegna just\
  \ tried to be in my heart but it is another history).\n\nAfter these vacations,\
  \ I was there in 2016 to celebrate 20 years of friendship.  In March of 2017, she\
  \ came to Rio de Janeiro for her first time.\n\nIf there are angels that connect\
  \ people in this planet, I am sure about this. Amanda gave me her city in my hands\
  \ with the best places to eat, to drink a beer or just places to take great photos.\n\
  \nAnd yes, we still send letters to each other with souvenirs of our cities, photos\
  \ and a lot of gifts."
