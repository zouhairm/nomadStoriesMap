Text: "My heart races as the bus approaches the checkpoint. I don\u2019t want to be\
  \ detained for 4 hours, like I was at the Jordanian border. I\u2019d gotten the\
  \ blessings from the Israelis to enter their country, despite their suspicions of\
  \ an earlier trip I\u2019d made to Lebanon. As a boy who grew up on the Canadian\
  \ plains I likened that feeling to being herded like cattle. I did not want to feel\
  \ that again, but I was determined to see Bethlehem, the historic town now within\
  \ the occupied Palestinian territories. The birthplace of Jesus Christ, and now\
  \ home to the infamous concrete wall that separates Israel and the West Bank. \n\
  \nAs I get off the bus and make my way towards the checkpoint I see what seems to\
  \ be an ocean of people. Not tourists, but residents of these lands. There are so\
  \ many people that their collective footsteps seem to upheave dust from the ground,\
  \ creating an artificial storm. Then I think to myself what a massive mistake I\u2019\
  ve made deciding to try to enter at this time - it is the first Friday of Ramadan,\
  \ and many of the Muslim Palestinians must be trying to enter Bethlehem to go pray.\
  \ As I get closer though I realize the people are not trying to enter Bethlehem,\
  \ but are leaving it. An Israeli soldier senses my perplexity, and approaches me\
  \ with assault rifle in hand. He tells me that many Muslims are heading into Jerusalem\
  \ to pray in the Old City. I am reminded just how much of a foreigner I am to the\
  \ ebb and flow of these lands. As I move forward I see a tall and long wooden wall,\
  \ with a walkway leading into it. This seems to be the way to enter the city, though\
  \ I am the only one who seems to be heading that way. I see a brooding soldier inside.\
  \ I show him my passport, he sees the stamp and with a nudge of his head he beckons\
  \ me through. I climb up a wooden ramp through the complex. I see the exit and step\
  \ outside. My senses are overloaded as I inhale more dust and my ears are attacked\
  \ by the shouts and screams of people in the distance. My jaw drops in awe to what\
  \ I am seeing.\n\nI am on a platform overlooking a maze of tall concrete barriers.\
  \ These are the final checkpoints. The way into Bethlehem is clear - but it is the\
  \ way out that is erupting and chaotic. I see soldiers waving the lines of people\
  \ through the labyrinth. These people are shoulder-to-shoulder, not an inch between\
  \ them, squeezed together by the immovable concrete. Children riding on their parents\
  \ soldiers. People leaning on each other because they cannot find space to stand\
  \ on their own feet. Soldiers shouting to calm and push the crowd, one hand waving\
  \ aggressively, the other tightly gripping their rifle. Again I think of cattle.\
  \ \n\nAs I walk down the platform closer to the checkpoint I hear a visceral cry.\
  \ I look left to see a child, crying a tsunami of tears. He is refusing to move.\
  \ I see his father fervently speaking to him, as if trying to calm him down whilst\
  \ nudging him forward. A soldier starts to approach the father. The father notices\
  \ and gets more visibly nervous. With his hands trembling the father decides to\
  \ throw his son over his shoulder, and the crowd keeps moving. The soldier turns\
  \ around and locks eyes with me. I take a deep breath and think what a fool I was\
  \ to stare as the soldier lumbers towards me. He gets close enough that I can read\
  \ his last name - Aarons. The words he says to me are simple:\n\n\u201CThis is just\
  \ the way things are.\u201D \n\nAnd once again I am reminded of how much of a foreigner\
  \ I am."
