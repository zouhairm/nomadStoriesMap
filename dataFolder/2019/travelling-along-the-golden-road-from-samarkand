Text: "Travelling the old Silk Road evokes romantic imagery of the desert, camels,\
  \ silk and spices. The renaissance of the Silk Road in popular imagination provided\
  \ me an opportunity to cast a curious, yet analytical eye to understand this resurgence\
  \ but also its historical significance during my recent travels across Uzbekistan\
  \ and Turkmenistan.\n\nSince declaring independence in 1991, both Uzbekistan and\
  \ Turkmenistan have had to create a national identity and narrative independent\
  \ of the Soviet Union, something which each has done by drawing on their rich histories.\
  \ The creation of a national narrative is used to legitimise the founding and subsequent\
  \ leaders. Of course, history of the region is not confined to arbitrary borders.\
  \ There are numerous intersections between the history of Uzbekistan and Turkmenistan,\
  \ and their neighbours. The \u201CSilk Road\u201D\u2014or \u201CSilk Roads\u201D\
  \ as there were different routes\u2014although a modern invention, is perhaps a\
  \ useful frame for understanding the development and transformation of not just\
  \ these two countries but of the region. The level of cultural, economic, social\
  \ and political interactions of the various civilisations and communities across\
  \ this region over time can be understood from the trade that occurred along the\
  \ Silk Roads.\n\nUzbekistan, as seen through the lens of art, architecture, food\
  \ and cultural history, is diverse. The various ethnic groups that populate the\
  \ country such as Uzbeks, Russians, Tajiks, Kazakhs, Karakalpaks and Tartars indicates\
  \ a rich cultural history. For example, the ornamentation of pottery and ceramics\
  \ we saw throughout Uzbekistan demonstrated the intercultural influence of China,\
  \ Islam and the indigenisation of these influences. The recurring naturalistic themes\
  \ such as birds, pomegranates, fish, flowers and other motifs appear throughout\
  \ both ancient and contemporary ceramics. At its simplest, geometric patterns not\
  \ only decorated ceramics but also walls of madrasahs, mosques and other architectural\
  \ forms. However, the design of Uzbek pottery also vary widely from region to region.\
  \ The prolific use of cobalt blue across Uzbek ceramic demonstrates the impact of\
  \ Chinese ceramics. Much of Chinese ceramic production was streamlined and standardised\
  \ with Jingdezhen becoming the largest centre of production not only in China but\
  \ in the world by the 14th century, as a result we see much less regional variation.\
  \ Whereas in Uzbekistan, ceramic and pottery production was very much, and still\
  \ is, localised. The style found in Bukhara today is earthy and perhaps cruder than\
  \ those made in Tashkent. \n\nThe cultural interactions as facilitated by the Silk\
  \ Road remains part of popular imagination today and are romanticised. Yet, the\
  \ artefacts on display in the museums in both Uzbekistan and Turkmenistan suggests\
  \ that the peoples of Central Asia from Sogdians to Sassanians to the Chinese were\
  \ as cosmopolitan, perhaps even more so than their contemporaries.\n\nTurkmenistan\
  \ felt subdued in comparison to Uzbekistan, as indicated by the number of tourists\
  \ at historical sites and general commercial activity. Ashgabat on first encounter\
  \ is new, glittering, excessive and perhaps paradoxically, sparse. Despite, my misgivings\
  \ for the Turkmen capital, travels to Merv, Nisa and Khorezm, conjured up images\
  \ of a rich cultural history with so many intersections with its Uzbek neighbour\
  \ and beyond. The huge expanse that is ancient Merv demonstrate what it was once\
  \ like as the capital of the Seljuk sultanate and a thriving metropolis of the Silk\
  \ Roads trade up until the 12th century.\n\nWhere Merv required an imagination to\
  \ visualise its grandeur, Nisa demands us to have an even more active imagination.\
  \ As the first capital of the Parthian Empire, which dominated this region of central\
  \ Asia from the mid-3rd century BCE to the early 3rd century CE, what is left of\
  \ it today are its fortress walls. There are sherds littering the sites in Nisa\
  \ and one can only imagine what daily life was like. The amazing rhytons\u2014ceremonial\
  \ drinking horns made from ivory\u2014I saw in the state museum in Mary, many were\
  \ found in Nisa. Trying to connect the details seen on the rhytons and the vast\
  \ expanse of Nisa, I can\u2019t help but imagine the excesses enjoyed by ancient\
  \ kings of the past. \n\nThe goods, people and ideas that flowed across the old\
  \ Silk Roads illustrate the cultural heterogeneity of the region. Plurality of culture,\
  \ ideas and people are critical to the flourishment of our own communities today."
