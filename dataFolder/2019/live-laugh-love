Text: "5 weeks ago I started solo travelling around Europe & Africa with a bunch of\
  \ strangers, alott of food, a whole lot of hangovers, Lots of sharing, Im leaving\
  \ with some of the coolest people that im proud to say are now my friends. We' ve\
  \ partied hard together, we ate tonss of local food together, we welcomed 2019 together,\
  \ we saw a part of the World together, we sang songs together, and thats the best\
  \ souvenir I got, these amazing people and their friendships. \nI travelled to Spain,\
  \ Morroco & Portugal. \nI still remember boarding my flight from Vancouver to Madrid,\
  \ I was having anxities & nervousesness and what not because I chose to go for the\
  \ unknown & I was solely responsible for myself to be able to trust few strangers\
  \ whom I had not yet met.  The cab ride from the airport to the hotel was about\
  \ 40minutes and I went with the flow having language as a barrier. I checked into\
  \ the hotel & there I met roughly about 35-40 strangers with whom I was about to\
  \ share an incredible trip. I did the Bernabeau Stadium tour with 5 other friends\
  \ (We ended up being friends after last nights dinner) next morning we drove down\
  \ to Granada and did a stop over in Toledo, Toledo is a world heritage city (not\
  \ many know) its beautiful and it was a cold morning when we reached there, we saw\
  \ the church, art galleries, walked down the allies and ate lots of churros !! Upon\
  \ arrival in Granda, we did a flamenko night and more Tapas!! I dont think it could\
  \ have been any more than a spectacular show watching the ladies dance inside a\
  \ cave! There was soo much energy, laughter and wine there! The next morning we\
  \ did the Alhambra palace tour what can I say that place is soo peaceful and a beauty\
  \ over looking the city of Granada. The following morning we boarded ferry and made\
  \ our way into Africa (Morroco) was unique as it gets, the earthy scent of Fes Medina,\
  \ the donkeys carrying day to day loads, the kaledioscope of carpets, the coconut\
  \ trees in Marrakech, the charm of morrocon lamps, Morroco has been unique in soo\
  \ many ways! Ooh not to forget the Hamam experience in Fes, it was awkward to begin\
  \ with, but leaving with a beautiful soft skin its all worth it!! City of Asilah\
  \ reminded me some how of Greece all the houses and the Medina was blue and white\
  \ & the calming ocean added more to the city. Morroco is far more unique than in\
  \ our wildest dreams! Heading back into Europe we went straight to lisbon! Oh Lisbon\
  \ is a city that is weirdly wonderful! Its very colourful full of art, history and\
  \ lots of sardines! For all the food lovers Time out Lisboa is a place to eat! There\
  \ is soo much so much to eat there! we did Sintra tour and Casicas its stunning\
  \ there, sintra is unique the architure there has been centuries old! Oh the ice\
  \ cream in Caiscas if you are there try it! Some say its the best in portugal while\
  \ others beileve its the best in the world! \nThe following morning we left for\
  \ Madrid, it was the end if our trip, I remember the first day when I came I was\
  \ shy, not so confident girl, fighting a battle of depression & anxiety, and I could\
  \ not thank myself enough to be able to do this trip in 10 minutes of planning,\
  \ I feel free, I feel alive soo much more confident and happy on the inside! I feel\
  \ doing things out of comfort zone is one important thing we do to ourselves, the\
  \ world has soo much to offer than being in a comfort zone! grateful & thankful\
  \ for myself for doing myself this! Lisbon I will be back!!"
