Text: "Mauritius has many stray dogs.\n\nThere are stray dogs in sugarcane plantation\
  \ fields, not as sweet as the cane they feed on - only as brutal. Stray dogs in\
  \ temples, feeding off fruit offerings like gods - leaving gods to starve. Across\
  \ the road from the cluster of clubs in Grand Baie, sniffing empty rum bottles for\
  \ water. Onetime, at the top of Le Pouce mountain with everyone else searching for\
  \ a feeling of freedom which is ironic for a stray dog - to dangle its tongue upwards\
  \ as if to taste clouds. As if starving gods are merciful enough to give treats.\
  \ And at all beaches - an average of 15 minutes away from everyone on the little\
  \ Island of Mauritius.\n \nI would come to know that Mauritian stray dogs are toothless.\
  \ Their barks are born as whistles when their tongues push against their gums. They\
  \ are nothing like the dogs back home in Northern Nigeria; dogs who can shoot a\
  \ gun if you recruit them - kidnap them. These ones are truly free. They are like\
  \ screams in a horror movie; like a theme that ties the story of Mauritius together.\n\
  \nOne morning, I was taking a reflective walk on a beach trying to convince the\
  \ ocean that I can be deeper than it. It was one of those fast walks you take when\
  \ you\u2019re too unfit to jog - so you convince yourself that you would be burning\
  \ the same amount of calories anyway - when I spotted a stray dog emerging from\
  \ the water. \n \nSo I know it can swim. \n \nMy heart pounded faster than my legs\
  \ would ever run. All the sweat I was waiting on streamed in. \n \nThe dog strayed\
  \ towards me with its tongue hanging so low it could taste the sand before deciding\
  \ to taste me. So low, it had no business tasting clouds. \n \nI once read that\
  \ hands intimidate dogs. I must have read upside down because my hands were intimidated\
  \ by this dog. I hid them in the lower hanging pocket of my hoodie and started walking\
  \ in slow motion. My thoughts were rambling in my Nigerian accent \u2018Chisos,\
  \ we go die here\u2019.  \n \nThe dog came so close its head was bowed at my feet.\
  \ Within a second, I kicked, screamed, and punched the air (quite unnecessarily).\
  \ \nThen I stopped. \n  \nThis wasn\u2019t fear.\nThis was anger. \n \nBy now, the\
  \ dog had run away. It would be pet by someone taking a deeper walk by the beach;\
  \ who did not fear it, but understood that it only needed its belly to be rubbed\
  \ and its fur stroked. Someone who knew that sometimes a need for love looks scary.\
  \ \n \nThat anger really comes from fear of not knowing how to love the unknown.\
  \ \n\nThat stroking a stray dog is tapping from its freedom. \n\nEverything I felt\
  \ the need to compete with were things I feared; stray dogs, the ocean, Dawn Idoko\
  \ from 10th grade. And things I will come to love. \n\nMaybe if I wasn\u2019t scared,\
  \ I already win. \n \nMaybe truly, fear is a toothless Mauritian dog bowing at your\
  \ feet right before you run, when you could just dance to its whistles. \n \nAs\
  \ much as Mauritian hotels are named after the dodo bird, you will never find one.\
  \ You will find an array of souvenirs shaped as the dodo bird, murals of dodos on\
  \ hidden walls in Port Louis. If you\u2019re lucky, during happy hour in the South\
  \ of Mauritius at a bar owned by the Flying Dodo Brewing Company, you can find a\
  \ beer named Dodo. Not much is said about the dogs who feed like gods and move like\
  \ waves in Mont Choisy beach - crystal-like and soothing. \n\nStray dogs encompass\
  \ the symbolic spirits of extinct dodo birds. \n\nIf you ever visit Mauritius, they\
  \ will be at the airport eager to teach you how to not fear the country. They will\
  \ be there with the sunrise every morning you walk to the beach, at the entrance\
  \ of the dodo-themed restaurant you\u2019re having lunch and across spicy panini\
  \ joints open until 4am. \n\nYou must stray towards them. If they take the first\
  \ steps, do not scream. This is not a horror movie. This is Mauritius. This is heaven."
