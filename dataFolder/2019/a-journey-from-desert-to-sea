Text: "A journey from Jaipur to goa. Jaipur, capital of Rajasthan state of india or\
  \ we can say jaipur , capital of land of desert. people living here have a dream\
  \ of seeing a sea or ocean...same it was mine. In final year of our graduation ,\
  \ a college trip was finalised from Jaipur to Goa. both the places are opposite\
  \ of each other in terms of geography . one is south pole other is north pole. A\
  \ journey started from Jaipur railway station. We were about sixty in number, the\
  \ first stoppage of journey was Mumbai (Maya nagari i.e City of illusions) approx\
  \ 20 hours train route, which was the longest train journey some of us ever had.After\
  \ reaching mumbai, we had 2 hr rest, then we went on site seeing the juhu beach\
  \ ...this was the first time i had seen so much water. At first glance i was shocked,\
  \ I got goosebumps, certain questions arised like what would happen if whole water\
  \ just start flowing towards me. I know it is strange, but this type of unusual\
  \ question comes in mind at some shocking stages of life. It took me 15 mins to\
  \ be normal , after then I started loving waves, its silence, chirping of birds,\
  \ etc  When i closed my eyes and realised all,  I felt that am in a heaven. Sooner\
  \ i was called from heaven to earth as our faculties announced that we have a little\
  \ time, at evening we have to leave for Goa.\nWhen a youngster in India hear a word\
  \ of goa, A cute and naughty smile arrives at face because goa is one of the most\
  \ loved place of India specially for youth.\nTravelling whole night and some portion\
  \ of next morning we reached our destination.\nAll over there were green lush, beautiful\
  \ scenes, new people, new language, new traditions, new style and many more.\nfrom\
  \ the nearby railway station to hotel , our traveller guide arranged two buses...\n\
  the first thing i noticed while seating in bus was, there were more scooties on\
  \ road rather than bikes , I was amazed to see , thats why earlier i mentioned an\
  \ opposite place to Jaipur.\nIn later part of day , we went to various famous beaches\
  \ like baga, vagator , calangute , Anjuna etc we enjoyed alot , the water here was\
  \ more clear than mumbai beach. May be because Mumbai is a populas city.\nwhile\
  \ we were departing from Anjuna  beach, a melodious sound i heared that was of Lamborghini,\
  \ all people were out with cameras and phones to capture its one image.\nIf you\
  \ went to goa , and missed a chance to explore goa by a bike , let me tell you ,\
  \ you missed alot. \nwe were aware of this fact , and got a scooty on rent , and\
  \ explored goa. petrol cost were cheaper and mileage  was good we went on a ride\
  \ of 50 km and saw Aguada fort, Famous church of st. Francis And  harvalem waterfall.\
  \ \nAlthough trip was short but it was  so memorable and we  all enjoyed alot .\n\
  we requested our tour coordinator to extend one day more but whole journey was fixed\
  \ and tickets were booked.\nNext morning , Unfortunately the train was on time,\
  \ we thanked goa for all its memories."
