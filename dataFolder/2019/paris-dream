Text: "We have finally left the unbearable heat of Rome; I am not longer dripping\
  \ in sweat and my feet no longer swollen.  We touch town in Paris. The cool air\
  \ hits our faces like a sweet relief; it is somehow calm in its chaos. We check\
  \ in to a little apartment like hotel, the lift is so tiny we must go one by one,\
  \ squashed up against our suitcase. It has sweet cottage like flowers on the windowsill\
  \ perfecting framing the view of buildings that ooze character. I have never seen\
  \ so many beautiful building in one place, a normal sight for the Parisan. \nItching\
  \ to explore, we saunter down the cobblestone streets, discovering a store dedicated\
  \ to cheese alone. The smell is intoxicating, a man dressed in white proudly stacks\
  \ what I assume is Gruyere on his shelves. Even the supermarket stocks what I would\
  \ refer to as \u201Cgourmet\u201D is just normal here. I feel very much at home\
  \ yet simultaneously question why we don\u2019t have this at home in Australia.\
  \ We buy some pate, cheese, baguette, ham and champagne for a picnic we plan to\
  \ have at the feet of the Eiffel tower. \nThere is an air here, hard to explain\
  \ as I soak it up in a caf\xE9 we found nearby. The waiter is dressed up and takes\
  \ pride in his service. There is a sense of relaxation, I must stop to breathe in\
  \ my coffee and savour every nibble of my fresh croissant stuffed with chocolate.\
  \  I see an elegant lady enjoying her croissant with a little dog on her lap. \n\
  We meet our French friend Camille at Notre Dame Cathedral. It is more than impressive.\
  \ It\u2019s imposing presence and history leaves me with a sense of awe. Its towering\
  \ spires and gothic structure could easily be studied for days. My eyes pour over\
  \ the detail in which a mere photo pales in comparison.\nThere is a local used book\
  \ store nearby, I ignore the kitschy Eiffel tower magnets and focus on the local\
  \ postcards. I find a postcard that I still have to this day. A black and white\
  \ snapshot of a young man in a suit and sunglasses at the book store reading, so\
  \ simple yet somehow has captured the essence of the moment.\nOur friend then leads\
  \ us to her local caf\xE9. Everyone speaks French, I am almost embarrassed to reveal\
  \ my accent and speak as we would stick out like sore thumbs. I want to be one them!\
  \ Our friend orders for us and I gratefully receive a giant slice a lemon meringue\
  \ pie. The buttery crust, creamy meringue and citrus lemon is so perfect- I am yet\
  \ to find a pie as satisfying. \nWith walking off the pie, we reach the stretching\
  \ grounds of royal past. It is everything I hoped for, it is lavish, beautiful,\
  \ and over the top- conjuring images of royalty strolling around their gorgeous\
  \ manicured gardens. I am not disappointed at all with Paris, there is simply beauty\
  \ everywhere you cast your eye, and the French accept this as normal and I feel\
  \ would not be happy with anything less than that. It is inspiring to live beyond\
  \ necessity and structural functionally. \nIt was only a mere four days in this\
  \ dream land, but made such lasting impact that left me wanting more. In this short\
  \ time, I was reminded of taking in the beauty of things in everyday life and enjoying\
  \ every bite. I saw not one but three different protests in and around the streets\
  \ of Paris. It was so foreign to me, a loud group marching and bellowing about their\
  \ concerns. This was also a vital reminder that perhaps we are too complacent. We\
  \ are not passionate like this about our government changes, our buildings, our\
  \ food? There is much to be learned from the French, even if we can just start with\
  \ a prefect croissant that can be purchased for a mere euro!"
