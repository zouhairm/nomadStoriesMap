Text: "Why are you traveling? What do you want to see, feel and learn from the trip?\n\
  These questions always filled my head every time I set foot out of the house, out\
  \ of my hometown. Whatever my purpose is, whether it is for work, family events\
  \ or traveling, I am always enthusiastic about what and who I will meet on my trip.\
  \ For me, every trip I have taken and will take is a very valuable experience in\
  \ this short life.\n\nOf course, of the many trips I have gone through, there will\
  \ be some that leave a melancholic impression in my heart. The first time I traveled\
  \ abroad was in 2016, I along with a group of co-workers took a 4-day and 3-night\
  \ trip to Malaysia and Singapore. We arrived at KLIA 2 airport on August 29, 2016\
  \ and in the first hours I was in Malaysia, I immediately fell in love with the\
  \ atmosphere of life there. The roads are clean, the traffic flow is neatly organized,\
  \ and the food is full of Malay influences, India, China and others.\n\nWe spentour\
  \ first night by exploring the Petaling Jaya area, seeing the night market full\
  \ of crowds there. There I found snacks that I had never seen and never tried in\
  \ my life, chestnut! An old Chinese woman selling chestnuts roasted with charcoal\
  \ in the market, I curiously asked her, 'what is this, ma\u2019am? \u201CThis is\
  \ chestnut. Do you want to try?\u201D She answered, and she gladly gave me a small\
  \ bag of chestnuts for free. I ate it with joy and admiration, in my heart I thought\
  \ how vast is this world and it is full of things I did not know, I was almost 30\
  \ years old and I didn't know what chestnuts are.\n\nWith that exciting new experience,\
  \ I was able to return to our inn and sleep well. The next morning after breakfast,\
  \ we check-out of the inn and went to the next destination: Batu Caves, to see Malaysia's\
  \ well known Hindu temple which is famous for its golden statue of God Murugan.\
  \ There is not much spiritual experience that I can get there, because I am an agnostic\
  \ and I am less concerned with spiritual matters, our group also had to quickly\
  \ depart from there to continue our trip to Johor Bahru.\n\nWe arrived in Johor\
  \ Bahru on the night of 30 August 2016, we stayed at the Golden Crown Hotel. The\
  \ next day, 31 August 2016 we had to miss the festive celebration of independence\
  \ of Malaysia, because we had to travel to Singapore. Singapore is well known for\
  \ its strict immigration policies and regulations in order to maintain the security\
  \ of it\u2019s citizens. There are not too many things that I can see in our short\
  \ visit in this small and rich country, we just spent time taking pictures around\
  \ the Merlion statue, having lunch in Little India, walking around at Gardens by\
  \ the Bay and Universal Studios. We ended our day by returning to Johor Bahru to\
  \ sleep.\n\nThe next day, September 1, 2016 was the last day of our trip. We went\
  \ back to Kuala Lumpur, boarded the Air Asia plane from KLIA2 airport and returned\
  \ to Indonesia. I am really grateful to be able to visit Malaysia and Singapore,\
  \ but Malaysia alone has captured my heart. How that delicious chestnuts and the\
  \ warmth of a malaysian chinese old lady's gestures have left a very deep impression\
  \ on me. I have a desire that someday I would go back there, to Malaysia, which\
  \ was full of color and love. Like the jargon that is often expressed in their tourism\
  \ advertisements, Malaysia is Truly Asia."
