Text: "Having been through a recent break-up and losing my dream job at the same time\
  \ earlier this year, the only escape-route that I could think of was a solo trip\
  \ to somewhere peaceful to get away from the depression and over-thinking that followed.\
  \ And the first place that came to my mind was Rishikesh since introspection is\
  \ the best form of healing. And what would be a better place to introspect own thought\
  \ other than the banks of Ganges in complete Beatles style. So without giving a\
  \ second thought I booked bus ticket of the very next day, hoped into the late-night\
  \ bus and there I was in Rishikesh early in the morning at 4:30. But being stupid\
  \ enough to not book a guest-house, I had to roam round in search of for an hour\
  \ or so, thankfully the local rishaw-drivers were sweet and helped me with a hunt.\
  \  After finding a place I took a rest till sunrise and then decided to leave for\
  \ some exploration. After having an amazing breakfast in the beautiful HoneyHut\
  \ caf\xE9, I went on to cross the Laxman Jhula(bridge). On the other side of the\
  \ bridge, there is this huge Shiva temple which has Lord Shiva\u2019s different\
  \ forms along with the statue of other Hindu gods and goddesses. After being done\
  \ with the tour of the temple as well as my lunch, I decided to go see the very\
  \ famous Lord Shiva statue at the bank of river Ganga. After having completed the\
  \ spiritual part of the day I wanted to sit on the river bank. Sitting there I could\
  \ feel the peaceful aura of the town. Sitting on the banks all to myself, the river\
  \ flowing on one side and the rocks forming a seat to welcome people who are in\
  \ search of peace on the other side, what else did I need! Then the day ended with\
  \ amazing Chinese food in the very famous Beatles Caf\xE9.\n\nThe next day I work\
  \ up early in the morning and went for a walk as someone told me that \u201Cif you\
  \ want to know the depths of a place, go on a morning walk, see the sunrise.\u201D\
  \ My plan was to visit The Beatles Ashram that day. So asking my way through and\
  \ then taking a lift from a local boy I reached the ashram. And frankly, the whole\
  \ hype is true, it is immensely beautiful, a sight to behold. Completely explains,\
  \ why out of all places the band decided to reside over here. It is close to nature.\
  \ Never have a seen a place that is a gateway of peace and majestic at the same\
  \ time. Trees all around and a beautiful view of river Ganga. That is one place\
  \ that left a strong impression on my mind, which is going to stay for a long time.\
  \ I got out of the ashram to head to Triveni Ghat and on my way back I befriended\
  \ a fellow traveler who was also on a solo trip. We decided to have lunch in The\
  \ Buddha Caf\xE9; it serves the best Mushroom Dimpsums. Then headed towards the\
  \ Ghat. The Ghat is popular for the unique style of prayer that the priests offer\
  \ to the river and the four directions. Once the prayers were done, we decided to\
  \ score some local marijuana. We sat on the river bank, got high and talked about\
  \ life in general. That very night I had to catch the bus for back home. So I had\
  \ dinner with this new friend of mine and left for the bus stop. And there ended\
  \ my 2 days solo trip.\n\nI wonder how much the place had to offer. Great places,\
  \ experiences, amazing food in fancy cafes and not to forget, a new friend. I had\
  \ so many memories to take back with me. They say every new experience teaches you\
  \ something and gives you a memory to get back to, that ends a lifetime. It is actually\
  \ true! Every word of it! I never felt that close to myself ever before. And to\
  \ me, knowing oneself is the most beautiful form of healing. The place touched my\
  \ soul in its own style."
