Text: "Given that most of my friends had spent their vacays backpacking around basically\
  \ anywhere else but Israel, I had the unique opportunity to travel throughout Israel\
  \ as an unknown \u2013 as a place that wasn\u2019t in every second post on my Instagram\
  \ feed, desensitising me to the sights before I had even set foot on the ground.\
  \ Israel would prove to be a land of extremes in all the ways I was not expecting,\
  \ and in none of the ways that people and the media had warned me.\n\nThe irony\
  \ and the paradoxes were apparent immediately. The modern coastline of Tel Aviv\
  \ felt like Los Angeles with extensive shorefront gym equipment, rollerbladers and\
  \ tanned, bikini-clad dog-walkers bustling along the esplanade. Red and white umbrellas\
  \ sheltered sunbathers along the coast in areas safe for swimming while the Mediterranean\
  \ confronted the shore with each break. Within a few days I would experience the\
  \ contrast of the more conservative and traditional Jerusalem with Orthodox Jews\
  \ donning extremely modest dress and black suits despite the sweltering heat for\
  \ which their faith would not waver. Jerusalem became a ghost town after the horn\
  \ signalled sunset on the Friday evening for the beginning of Shabbat.  In Tel Aviv\
  \ they played, and in Jerusalem they prayed.\n\nBelow sea level, the aquamarine\
  \ waters of the Dead Sea were made clearer by the pearly salt that lay beneath it\
  \ \u2013 a welcome sight after walking the top of Masada and driving through the\
  \ arid Judaean desert. It was 47C but the enticing water offered no relief from\
  \ the sun, the still water absorbing every ray and the salt slightly stinging my\
  \ skin. The dry heat was less bearable than what I had encountered Down Under, and\
  \ I began to understand why nothing could survive here given the heat and salinity\
  \ of the sea. We made our way to the Golan Heights a few days later, and walked\
  \ through lush vineyards and fruit orchards full of life; ran by a local Kibbutz\
  \ near the Lebanese border. I selected the perfect apple from the tree and crunched\
  \ as I walked, acutely aware of the snakes that we were warned often visited the\
  \ farm for water. \n\nAcross the country, the military presence was hard to ignore,\
  \ ever-present at any site that might be a possible target for terrorist activity\
  \ which depending on the circumstance, I felt either nervous or secure. Young female\
  \ soldiers were particularly interesting since they are less common and visible\
  \ in Australia, and their uniform did not stop them from accessorising. A trainee\
  \ praying in the women\u2019s section of the Western Wall searched for a crack to\
  \ place her carefully considered prayers while having to navigate the crowds with\
  \ both a standard issue assault rifle and an iridescent silver sequin backpack.\
  \ Khaki and sequins are in this Spring: you heard it here. \n\nThe threat of terrorism\
  \ was particularly pronounced in Sderot, less than a kilometre from the Gaza Strip.\
  \ The Bomb Shelter Capital of the World lived up to its name with bomb shelters\
  \ painted like whimsical fairy houses,  obviously trying to add ambience to children\u2019\
  s playgrounds despite the fact that their very purpose was to protect children from\
  \ rocket fire. The local police station displayed a wall of mangled rocket shells\
  \ that had been fired at the town over the years \u2013 a reminder of past traumas\
  \ and a warning of the possibilities to come. But everyday life continues on \u2013\
  \ I stroll past a kindergarten with children singing and laughing, and every house\
  \ has perfectly manicured lawns and gardens. \n\nI was on a bus on the way to Be\u2019\
  er Sheva, where the ANZACs won an unlikely battle in WWI. Just when I think the\
  \ contrasts in Israel couldn\u2019t be any more pronounced, I instantly forget where\
  \ I am. The streets are lined with variations of Eucalyptus and I see the familiar\
  \ colourway; greys, pinks and greens that saturate the landscape in Australia. Israel\
  \ is a land steeped in tradition, controversy and history, but the modern adaptations\
  \ have resulted in a rich tapestry of extremes that must be experienced first-hand\
  \ to fully appreciate them so they are no longer 'the unknown' by travellers who\
  \ are fearful of extremism."
