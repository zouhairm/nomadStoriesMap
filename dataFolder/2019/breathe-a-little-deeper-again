Text: "In 2017 I decided to quit my job in New York and move to Moab, Utah. I had\
  \ a moment on the subway in New York where I realized I desperately needed a change,\
  \ to break free from my normal. So I took a short term job at a ranch/resort in\
  \ the middle of no where in Moab. I grew up in New York and while you cant completely\
  \ classify me as a city girl, this was a very random bold move. \n\nI packed my\
  \ little white Jetta with \"Moab\" typed into my GPS.  Not soon after I crossed\
  \ the Colorado state line, my GPS took me to Highway 148. As it said 20 minutes\
  \ to my destination I started to panic, there had been nothing in sight around me\
  \ for the last half hour and this road looked like it lead into a desert abyss.\
  \ Where the f*** did I just move to I thought , where on earth even am I? Then suddenly\
  \ a herd of antelope leapt across the plain in front of me. I immediately stopped.\
  \ Seeing these animals fully free and wild sent chills and awe through my body.\
  \ The air was crisp and the sky a bright blue with nothing in site as far as the\
  \ eye could see besides me and these antelope. I watched them leap away and was\
  \ filled with this magical feeling that I was exactly in the right place at exactly\
  \ the right time. I drove off with dust kicking up behind me on this one lane road\
  \ leading into the desert in a moment of complete bliss about the unknown. \n\n\
  \ When I arrived to the ranch, I felt I just stepped into a John Wayne movie. They\
  \ showed me to my apartment where I would be staying and literally my front and\
  \ back door opened up to the dusty red buttes of Moab that yes, were in the John\
  \ Wayne movies. My life completely and drastically changed within a few days. Within\
  \ the first few months of living there I already felt that I could breathe a little\
  \ deeper, connect with myself, and see the earth in a new way then I was able to\
  \ before. I learned how to rock climb for the first time, and conquered fears I\
  \ did not even know I had. \n\nI was supposed to only live in Moab for a 6month\
  \ sabbatical. But I became hooked on the lifestyle. Why return to a hectic 9-5 lifestyle\
  \ trying to beat a hustle that only leaves me stressed out? Why do we do this to\
  \ ourselves? I would rather live a free life experiencing the world first hand.\
  \ Moving to Moab awoke something in me that has lead me on an incredible journey\
  \ and I haven't stopped. \nI am not sure exactly what I am doing or where I am headed\
  \ but I do know that the open road holds a certain kind of beauty that I want to\
  \ fill my life with. When we aren't happy with our life situation it is usually\
  \ for a reason and our heart is begging us to listen. Once I was able to let go\
  \ of the fear of the unknown, magic started to happen and I felt free. I know we\
  \ might not all quit our jobs for a new lifestyle but even little trips that we\
  \ boldly take into the unknown can re-connect us with ourselves and we breathe a\
  \ little deeper again."
