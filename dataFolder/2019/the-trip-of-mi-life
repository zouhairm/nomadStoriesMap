Text: "Good evening Worldnomads, this is my history. I am fascinated to dream about\
  \ traveling, getting to know new cultures, food, people and places is the most important\
  \ thing to do in my life. I have been traveling once a year since 2010 when for\
  \ work I flew to central America. I met new people, food and places. Since then\
  \ I have been trying to get to know a new country every year. \nI am from Peru but\
  \ living in California for eight years, this is an amazing country full of opportunities.\
  \ I am taking english classes but my dream is to travel the world and get involved\
  \ in new cultures and countries. Get to know the people needs and the opportunity\
  \ in each country. Each country has something special, and I am ready to find it.\
  \ I enjoy walking in the street or riding a bike in new countries. I like running\
  \ too, one of my thing is to run in new places. \nI don not know what are you going\
  \ to see on this words but I am trying to let you know that this world is amazing,\
  \ sometime I can close my eyes and I see myself walking in other places with new\
  \ people and new cities full of amazing things. \nMy dream to go to Portugal is\
  \ almost there If I won it, if not I will be pleased to keep getting news from you.\
  \ I have family in Paris, and one of my cousin is from Portugal, they are amazing\
  \ people and amazing food too. \n\nThank you.\n\nJavier Raygada."
