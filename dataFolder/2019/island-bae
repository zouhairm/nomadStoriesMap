  \ island of Koh Lanta sweating, slightly seasick and lugging my suitcase behind\
  \ me with my bag strung lazily over my shoulder. My first solo trip across Thailand\
  \ was taking it\u2019s toll, especially as I\u2019d just arrived from the notorious\
  \  party island of Phi Phi. I definitely didn\u2019t catch the memo to steer clear\
  \ if your inner 80 year old just wants a quiet spot to read and unwind. \n\n\u201C\
  Ugh! Just please get me to my hostel.\u201D\nSurely this island will be better.\n\
  \nI spent the next few hours lounging on a cushion on the floor chatting to strangers\
  \ and feeling my worries fade away. I was so content I actually contemplated whether\
  \ I\u2019d died and gone to heaven. I pinched myself then smiled as the birds were\
  \ whistling and the trees swayed with the light breeze. Time to check out the local\
  \ food.\n\nI walked up to the stalls on the main road selling cheap Thai dishes,\
  \ Pad Thai, Mango Sticky Rice and loads of tropical fruits. Today I needed something\
  \ amazing and vegan and found it at the most chilled beautiful beach bar I\u2019\
  d ever seen in my life. Vegetable and tofu Panaeng curry with my toes in the sand\
  \ and view of the sea and what\u2019s this?\n\n\u201CHey\u201D\n\u201CHey\u201D\n\
  \u201CWe have an art fair on tomorrow if you\u2019re around?\u201D\nI politely broke\
  \ gaze to glance at the flyer he held out to me.\n\u201CSure, I\u2019ll be there.\u201D\
  \nArt fairs are fun right?\n\u201CI\u2019m Felix.\u201D\n\u201CPhoebe.\u201D\nDamn.\n\
  \nLet\u2019s go to the animal welfare centre, theres a vegan cafe and cats and dogs!\
  \ Uhhh...sure.\n\nWhen I saw the dogs at the centre, I fell in love. I was able\
  \ to take a few on their lunchtime walk up the Pumpkin Walk hills and through the\
  \ gum trees and never felt more fulfilled.  I love connecting with animals and love\
  \ being in nature and realised I\u2019d never done any volunteer work before and\
  \ seeing how much I was able to help in a short space of time really inspired me\
  \ to do more. I felt like I was truly living my truth. As I came more and more,\
  \ I saw the little dogs as my friends and yep, definitely turned into crazy dog\
  \ lady.\n\n\u201CThat\u2019s so cool\u201D\n\u201CI know, I\u2019m pretty cool\u201D\
  \n\u201CSo what are you doing tomorrow morning? Can I take you somewhere?\u201D\n\
  Yesssss!\n\u201CWhere do you wanna go?\u201D\n\u201CYou\u2019ll see.\u201D\nThank\
  \ you, universe!\n\nWow, he looks hot. It\u2019s 8.53am and I heard the growl of\
  \ his dirt bike coming up the dirt path blowing sand up in his tracks. \n\n\u201C\
  Sawasdee Ka\u201D\n\u201CKap\u201D He nodded through squinted eyes in the morning\
  \ sunlight.\n\nI hopped on the bike and we drove to the other side of the island,\
  \ Lanta Old Town, an authentic Thai town and had coffee on the jetty overlooking\
  \ the harbour. \n\n\u201CWhat\u2019s up?\u201D I asked.\n\u201CThey\u2019re building\
  \ a new pier here, there never used to be one.\u201D\n\u201CFor the tourists?\u201D\
  \n\u201CYeah.\u201D\n\u201CThat must be annoying.\u201D \n\nHe\u2019d grown up in\
  \ Lanta and saw tourism spike over the years. He owned his own bar so it was great\
  \ in one sense but he loved his little island as it was. The waves still sounded\
  \ the same but the structure and scaffolding nevertheless spoilt the view. \n\n\
  We made our way to Pirates Paradise, right at the top of the island near the National\
  \ Park, except we didn\u2019t make it that far as we passed by a Sea Gypsy hideout\
  \ by the beach. You can only imagine my face when I was told sea gypsies are like\
  \ the pirate natives of Lanta. We walked down to the secluded beach. Not a single\
  \ person in sight. \n\nI\u2019d never felt happier. Lanta was perfect. He was perfect.\
  \ The monkeys playing in the trees were perfect. \n\nI turned to him \u201CIt\u2019\
  s been good to have you to myself today\u201D\nWe kissed.\n\n\u201CYou have mosquito\
  \ nets where you from?\u201D\n\u201CNo\u201D\n\u201CWanna see?\u201D\n\nThere was\
  \ a long pause. I evaluated all the lessons I\u2019d learnt so far, all the mistakes\
  \ and blessings, Yet I hadn\u2019t regretted a thing. \n\n\u201CWhy not?\u201D\n\
  He smiled.\nI smiled back."
