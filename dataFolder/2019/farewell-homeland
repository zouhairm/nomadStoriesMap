Text: "Is this really happening? A few meters away, a middle-aged woman stood between\
  \ two full-grown bulls that were poised to fight each other. With arms extended,\
  \ as if trying to break up the fight, and in tears, she shouted: \u201CStop! What\
  \ will become of me?\u201D\n\n\u201CMaria! GET OUT! They\u2019ll trample you!\u201D\
  \ I could hear myself screaming while Maria-Roman\u2019s granddaughter, Lily, clung\
  \ to me and wailed.\nI\u2019d been holding my breath for the longest seconds of\
  \ my life until, just as suddenly as the commotion started, it ended: the bulls\
  \ stopped huffing and stomped on opposite directions. They\u2019d been fighting\
  \ for three days and even nights, when their bellows, topped with Maria\u2019s worried\
  \ sobs, would repeatedly interrupt our sleep.\n\nSquinting in the fiery sunlight,\
  \ I think back on the reason why I\u2019m here, completely off-the-grid in my country\u2019\
  s highlands. A week ago, I left the relative comfort of our coastal capital and\
  \ headed to Huancavelica, a rural province in the Peruvian \u201CSierra\u201D where\
  \ 50% of inhabitants live in extreme poverty.\nIt is here, in the settlement of\
  \ Chacoya, that my mother was born 58 years ago. I\u2019d often longed to visit\
  \ but had no relatives left in the area. Out of sheer luck, I contacted Maria, a\
  \ 52-year-old native \u201CChacoyan\u201D kind enough to host me in her adobe home\
  \ that sat hillside.\n\nLily was only accompanying her until school started in the\
  \ well-developed city of Pisco, 200 kilometers of mostly unpaved roads away.\n\n\
  Our days were spent helping out Maria. We started at 5, when the roosters crowing\
  \ outside awakened us. The view that greeted us, vast green pastures with huge mountains\
  \ as backdrop and the clearest, bluest skies, was enough to make anyone\u2019s heart\
  \ soar. \nBut stepping outside was a different story. The icy, dry air that hit\
  \ us reminded me of our location: the austere Andes. If those pastures were green,\
  \ it wasn\u2019t due to nature being oh-so kind, but thanks to Maria\u2019s irrigation\
  \ methods and daily efforts.\n\nImmediately, we marched to the water well that was\
  \ 10 minutes away, each carrying 2 buckets. We made the trip thrice each morning.\
  \ Our hard work would definitely pay off considering what awaited us back home:\
  \ a delicious spread of cheese, bread, jam, potatoes and eggs (all homemade or home-gathered).\
  \ See, Maria had a barn next to her house, and she cultivated different types of\
  \ grains and vegetables in its surroundings. She once told me how much this helped\
  \ when rearing her 4 children, whom now were all adults, and all gone\u2013and she\
  \ was so happy they left.\n\nI wondered why, given the peaceful existence one can\
  \ live here. Maria looked at me with sadness in her eyes, \u201CThis is my ancestors\u2019\
  \ land, but I didn\u2019t want my children to grow up to be farmers. It\u2019s a\
  \ tough life; living here requires hard work and, little by little, we wear away\
  \ to nothing. We\u2019ll never learn to read, we\u2019ll never travel\u2026\u201D\
  \ She made all of her children study and leave. Her only dream was to see them all\
  \ become professionals, and they did.\n\nWhen Maria cried about the bulls fighting,\
  \ it wasn\u2019t out of love for them as pets. Although it was clear she respected\
  \ every animal she owned, the bulls were her only cash-generating assets. While\
  \ she took some of her cows\u2019 milk to make butter, and she harvested corn daily,\
  \ this was all meant for personal consumption. The bulls, however, helped with the\
  \ plowing, and when that was done she rented them to neighboring landowners.\n\n\
  Heading out to collect water might seem feasible for a couple of days, but doing\
  \ it everyday to survive is exhausting. \n\nLily will soon, like me, come back to\
  \ find no relatives in Chacoya. Some will wonder why she left, why she let her grandmother\u2019\
  s state wither to nothing, why she let their ancestral language disappear. But you\
  \ have to pick your battles. The \u201CMarias\u201D of this world already did when\
  \ faced with a government\u2013and a society\u2013that has completely forgotten\
  \ about them.\n\nOutside, the goats are bleating, and Maria is singing in quechua:\n\
  \nKawsaspaycha-kutimusaq, perlaschallay/\nWa\xF1uspayqa-mana\xF1acha\nIf I still\
  \ live, I'll come back, my little pearl (my homeland)/\nIf I die, this is goodbye"
