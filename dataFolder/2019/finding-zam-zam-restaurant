Text: "Taking vacation is incomplete without culinary, especially when  visiting new\
  \ place. The food can be traditional food, famous food or even famous restaurant\
  \ in the area. For the taste, it can be tasteful or tasteless. The easy way to find\
  \ out, I have to surf the web first, like I did before going to Singapore for the\
  \ first time last January in 2019. But I chose recommended restaurant from TV Show.\
  \ It is at Zam Zam Restaurant. It is Muslim Restaurant which is located on Arab\
  \ Street. That is one of the reasons why I decided to stay in hotel on Arab Street.\n\
  My expectation, my hotel location was near the restaurant, but my electronic map\
  \ directed me too far. I also had asked direction to the citizen, but it did not\
  \ work. I kept walking and my navigation led me to quiet road. It Looked like a\
  \ warehousing or I passed behind the big building. I met several Indian men with\
  \ mascular body passing by. So, I decided to come back and went to other path. The\
  \ more I walked I arrived at Indian Market. There are many Shops on the side of\
  \ the road. They sell Sari (Clothes for Indian women), fruits, necklace flowers,\
  \ etc. I turned out to end up to Little India from Bugis. No wonder I met Indian\
  \ people and crows during the trip.\nMy navigation showed that I was in my destination.\
  \ I looked around but there was not \u201CZam Zam Restaurant\u201D. Then, I made\
  \ up my mind to back to Arab street. I tried to ask direction to woman. She said\
  \ the restaurant was on Arab Street. So, my decision was right. I was excited again.\
  \ On the way back to Arab street, I found a picture of Indian woman as wall painting;\
  \ and I found colorful building which is used to photo backgrounds by people. The\
  \ place is instragramable. It looks like wall painting in Haji Lane. The different\
  \ is the wall painting in Haji Lane is picture characters, and wall painting in\
  \ Little India is just played with colour. \nIn addition, I found pretty building.\
  \ It seems a mosque. So, I came closer. I was right. It is Masjid Abdul Gafoor.\
  \ The color is buttery yellow and dark sap green color. The dome is surrounded by\
  \ minaret with crescent moon on it. When I entered the mosque, there was wall magazine\
  \ on my right side and Wudhu (ablution) place on my left side. It has unique architecture.\
  \ \nThen I continued my trip; and I was back at my starting point. While waiting\
  \ the green light at traffic light, I asked an old man to make sure I was on the\
  \ right path. Obviously, he would go to Zam Zam Restaurant too. He also did not\
  \ mind, I joined with him.\nEventually, Zam Zam Restaurant is on the side of the\
  \ road. It is in front of Sultan Mosque. Whereas several hours ago I looked around\
  \ the mosque, but I did not see it. It is just on other side of the mosque enterance.\n\
  The restaurant looks like the shop house. When I entered, the cashier desk welcomed\
  \ me. I sat on the first floor. Then, I ordered one portion of  Fish Rice Briyani\
  \ and a glass of Ice Tarik Tea. The drink was so yummy, and the food is too. One\
  \ portion is big for me. The taste is tasteful, spicy, and delicious. The price\
  \ is cheap. My struggle to reach this place after walking was paid off at the end.\
  \ By getting lost, I find more unexpected place and know better the way in Singapore."
