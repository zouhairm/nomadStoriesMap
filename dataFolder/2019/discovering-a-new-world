Text: "For three months I had poured over every how-to, what-to where-to I could get\
  \ my hands on. How to Avoid Travel Scams, Where to Stay in Morocco, What to Pack\
  \ for a Year Abroad. So, I thought to myself as I crouched behind a flimsy decorative\
  \ mirror and gold bohemian tapestry as a gang of four vengeful Marrakech teenagers\
  \ hunted me down in the labyrinth of the medina. I must have forgotten How do I\
  \ Get Out of This, Where do I go now and of course What the Hell was I Thinking?!\n\
  \ After a grueling thirty-five hour journey from Calgary, Alberta, I arrived in\
  \ Marrakesh just after midnight. I was picked up by a French speaking driver, courtesy\
  \ of my riad. He informed me that it was the Muslim holiday of Eid Al-Adha. I later\
  \ found out that this translates to \u201CFestival of Sacrifice\u201D.  \n It derives\
  \ from the story of the prophet Abraham having shown powerful obedience to God after\
  \ he was envisioned he was to kill his own son. Just before carrying out the ominous\
  \ deed, God stopped him and asked him to sacrifice a ram instead. Muslims observe\
  \ this holiday by slaughtering goats or other animals as a symbol of their faithful\
  \ obedience to God. My driver was excited to go home and celebrate with his family.\
  \ \n From the window I watched the night time action of the alien world outside.\
  \ Motorcycles darted passed us, helmetless passengers casually holding on by the\
  \ driver. White djellaba\u2019s billowing behind them. \n An unexpected amalgamation\
  \ of old city architecture obstructed with Western perfume billboards. I audibly\
  \ gasped when our vehicle was over taken by a horse and carriage. We soon arrived\
  \ at the walls of the medina. I expected I was very close to my riad. I could not\
  \ have been more wrong. My driver passed me off to a local man who only spoke Arabic.\
  \ He was to walk me to my riad. I felt weird having to be escorted. The man grabbed\
  \ my bags for me and motioned for me to follow him. I thanked my driver and followed\
  \ the man with my bags. \n He was hard to keep up with. Not because he walked at\
  \ a rapid pace but because I had just been whipped in the face with hot, heavy,\
  \ spicy air. I couldn\u2019t breathe without tasting the cumin, cayenne pepper and\
  \ ginger that seemed to float like dust in the street lamps. \n I stepped off a\
  \ space craft into a bizarre planet of bold colours, gawking robed men and a unruly\
  \ amount of cats. A lot of them missing ears or tails. Carpets were rolled out \
  \ presenting silvery trinkets and tagine pots, sandals and sunglasses, snakes and\
  \ post cards, wait SNAKES? I stopped dead in my tracks as I came face to face with\
  \ an Egyptian cobra and it\u2019s charmer. \nAfter twenty straight minutes of turning\
  \ left, right and left again, ducking through back alleys roofed with paisley carpets\
  \ and pottery shops and hidden holes in the wall, we arrived at my riad. Finding\
  \ a way out on my own would be no easy quest. \n The next day I would find myself\
  \ in several jarring situations. Despite my research and preparatory measures I\
  \ would still end up the victim of several travel scams. Pulled into shops, stalked,\
  \ harassed and attempted robbery. The  streets were quiet because of the holidays,\
  \ save a few desperate salesmen. I was a walking target with my sunburnt face and\
  \ friendly smile. \n After forty minutes hiding a mirror shop after escaping the\
  \ boys, the shock and adrenaline wore down. I drank the glass of water the shopkeeper\
  \ set down for me and with a new found bravery headed out to find my riad. I was\
  \ half convinced I would fly back to Canada but as I looked for my riad the heart\
  \ of the souk warmed up to me. I sat on the floor of a carpet shop and talked for\
  \ an hour with a local man over mint tea. I told him my horrifying story about my\
  \ unfortunate first day. He softly chuckled and sipped his tea. \n \u201CWell yes\
  \ darling. Everyone wants a piece of you. You are from another world.\""
