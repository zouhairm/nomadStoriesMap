Text: "I was running late due to my unsettled stomach.  I have always been an anxious\
  \ person, so I was not sure if it was the water or excitable nerves causing my bubbly\
  \ tummy.  That morning I had been thinking about the synchronistic timing of my\
  \ South Africa trip.  Having recently ended a relationship, I was praying this trip\
  \ would keep my mind occupied.  I was trusting in the cathartic ways of time and\
  \ travel for the heart but I was doubtful.  I paused for second to catch my breath\
  \ and take in the dusty surroundings of the Karoo.  I noted a subtle hint of manure\
  \ and dried pine in the air.  Then, as I came around the brush, there they were\
  \ basking in the morning sunlight, my breakfast dates.  Three enormous, African\
  \ elephants named Jabari, Bulelo and Malaika. \n \nToday\u2019s excursion was walking\
  \ and feeding the elephants.  I had no idea what to expect.  Was it safe?  Would\
  \ they suddenly get violent?  My anxious thoughts interrupting the moment\u2026\
  again.  The elephants arrived several years prior from the Kruger National Park\
  \ in South Africa when their parents were killed during a poaching spree.  Now,\
  \ the orphaned elephants reside within the well-protected grounds of Buffelsdrift\
  \ Game Lodge, approximately four hours east of Cape Town.  I stumbled down the dusty-orange,\
  \ path arriving just in time.  I noticed the elephants kept a watchful eye on the\
  \ two handlers with us.  One handler told me they devote their entire lives to feeding\
  \ and taking care of the elephants.  They go wherever the elephants go.  I pondered\
  \ this lifetime commitment as I walked next to the bigger bull Bulelo, meaning \u201C\
  thank you.\u201D  I was fixated on his strong oval-shaped feet.  Every powerful\
  \ step created a small plume of dust, as if testing the stability of the earth below\
  \ him.  All the elephants\u2019 ears were gently fanning to cool down; waving back\
  \ and forth.  My anxiety was slowly starting to subside.\n\nMaking our way down\
  \ a steep path to the watering hole the group of guests stayed back briefly while\
  \ the elephants rumbled directly to the water.  As we watched them slurp and sip\
  \ from the muddy shore of the watering hole, the handlers instructed the guests\
  \ to touch the elephants and take a picture.  Standing along the left side of Bulelo,\
  \ with trepidation, I reached out for my first photo opportunity.  He just stood\
  \ there accepting and receiving the attention; never flinching for moment.  I could\
  \ feel he had long, tickly hairs all over his dry, coarse skin.  I had never imagined\
  \ this moment and briefly looked into his large brown eye.  I quickly turned as\
  \ I did not want upset him but I was beginning to feel smitten. \n\nPausing at an\
  \ open, grassy area, the elephants patiently stood nearby for their snack.  Then\
  \ the handler demonstrated how to feed the elephant.  This made me nervous.  Now\
  \ it was my turn to feed Bulelo.  I quickly placed a prickly pineapple into his\
  \ cavernous mouth and jumped back.  However, like a good student, Bulelo did not\
  \ move an inch.  After getting his snack, I stepped forward to receive a powerful,\
  \ elephant hug.  Then unexpectedly, my heart began to expand.  I could feel his\
  \ leathery trunk encircle my shoulders and the weight was calmly moving me from\
  \ side-to-side, like a slow dance.  He was gentle and beautiful.  I held him for\
  \ an extra second, as I cherished this newfound friendship.  I reluctantly had to\
  \ let go from my amorous moment, to let the next guest take their picture.  Lastly,\
  \ I stood in the center of all three elephants.  They knew exactly what to do. \
  \ It was time for the group hug.  There I was with three powerful trunks encircling\
  \ my body.  I felt their warmth on my shoulders and their coarse trunk encircle\
  \ my waist.  My anxiety dissipated completely.  I did not know what to expect in\
  \ a place famously known for its raw nature but I definitely did not expect to find\
  \ love.  I never thought I would experience compassion and strength is such a brief\
  \ encounter, but I did.  I knew right then, I was deeply, whole-heartedly in love."
