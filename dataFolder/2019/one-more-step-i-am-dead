Text: "Arrived pushkar for a peaceful atmosphere of Sacred Lake before leaving to\
  \ Mountains which is located more than  one thousand kilometers. It is a  challenge\
  \ to reach my final destination as it has no proper roads and I had to cross around\
  \ 5 river passings. So I thought of spending  few days in between to prepare mentally\
  \ to travel through world\u2019s one of the most dangerous roads. \n\nFrom Pushkar\
  \ three students flew from Spain joined me by listening about the beauty of the\
  \ mountains. We spend days in exploring the beauty of lower Himalayas and they returned\
  \ after camping in a beautiful valley where we reached in a motorbike which was\
  \ their life\u2019s best challenging ride as they said.\n\nNext morning, I was waiting\
  \ for a public transport which has service daily once and no guarantee it will come\
  \ or not. My luck, a friend of mine who met in the Manali valley town recognized\
  \ me waiting for a lift and he had space for me in his car. Here I am, world\u2019\
  s one of the most amazing place, \u201CSpiti Valley\u201D where adventurers comes\
  \ from all over the world, the total population of the town is around 300 and no\
  \ mobile network or internet. When I am settled in a home stay and out for a meal\
  \ at night, I couldn\u2019t look at down as I am seeing most stars in the sky at\
  \ the same time and on the way I saw many people staring at the Milky Way and trying\
  \ to see a shooting star which is usually happens on daily basis.\n\nFrom next morning\
  \ I was so excited because I was going to explore many hidden heavenly places on\
  \ the earth such as worlds highest villages, post office, and cafes which is situated\
  \ in different places so I can only go one place in a day as I have to arrive back\
  \ in my motorbike before sunset. The roads are filled with muds and small stones\
  \ which had high chance of slippong down to valley easily, so everybody goes at\
  \ a very low speed with the help of legs on the ground. \n\nAnd today is my day\
  \ to go  Pin Parbati, The Pin Parbati Pass is a mountain pass in Himachal Pradesh,\
  \ India, at 5,319 meters. It was first crossed in August 1884 by Sir Louis Dane\
  \ in search of an alternate route to the Spiti valley. As I was so excited to go\
  \ and explore one of the most beautiful valley in the world, prepared my motorbike,\
  \ checked if everything is good with him and I started after a light breakfast.\
  \ I was moving on a machine through the valley of Kaza, feeling I was living in\
  \ my dreams and so excited to see the Pin Parbati, there is no proper road as usual,\
  \ so I was riding at a low speed for safety.  All sudden, I got something hit on\
  \ the motorbike, Yes!! I realize I have a life and death situation here, in ten\
  \ seconds the bike will  be going deep down to the valley from at least 300 feet\
  \ height, my mind was so quick to take a decision what to do in very few seconds\
  \ and I have decided to leave the Machine and save me jumping off from the motorbike.\
  \ I landed on the edge of the road which means one more step I am going down to\
  \ 300-400 feet. I step back, turned and I saw one of the so sad scene in the all\
  \ journey, a baby donkey, who hit me from the back it was dead instant because it\
  \ was running so fast and hit me so hard on the machine. I tried to get up, sudden\
  \ I realize I cannot get up and my body is paining, I saw blood, my torn jacket\
  \ and gloves and I am not able to move. I had no idea until another biker found\
  \ me and called help from the villagers. I lost my machine and I don\u2019t care\
  \ but the baby donkey stole my sleep for many days. After bedrest at the home stay\
  \ for few days, I have decided to go to the town for a better medical help."
