Text: "A loud thud on the window wakes me up. I'm sure of a thief or a ghost. Sane\
  \ and strong enough to not scream, I noiselessly walk towards the window with a\
  \ pepper spray in my hand, and I'm about to spray when the thief starts laughing.\
  \ It's Kanika! We both laugh for a moment, and then I slap her for scaring me. It's\
  \ 2:13 am. I invite her inside through the window. \u201CDon\u2019t you think the\
  \ summer vacations are going little monotonous?\u201D Kanika mutters. \u201COh!\
  \ So to make it interesting, you come to my house in the middle of the night and\
  \ haunt me! Huh!\u201D I chide.\nWe talk in low voices and what inspires us to walk\
  \ out of the house; go to others' houses and wake them up, nobody knows. All five\
  \ of us sit in a circle in the park nearby. With all the calculations of distance,\
  \ money, time, and safety, we plan a four days trip to Gangtok! At 5:00 am, we all\
  \ slid into our houses and wake up at 7:00 am. After rigorous manipulations and\
  \ emotional blackmails bombed on our parents, everybody's parents permit for the\
  \ trip. The packing starts. We reach the railway station by 11 am. The train arrives,\
  \ and the journey begins. Singing and dancing, we forget everything and enjoy train\
  \ travel. We arrive at New Jalpaiguri Station by 3:00 pm and book a shared jeep\
  \ to Gangtok.\nWe sit silently and enjoy the cool breeze (though it was summer)\
  \ slapping our faces! We pass silver fir, magnolia, alder, birch, bamboo, maple,\
  \ and rhododendron trees, ferns, lichens stuck on rocks, flowers in colors of red,\
  \ blue, and many others (whose names we didn\u2019t know). We cross steep and slippery\
  \ valleys, small waterfalls, many dragon-shaped gateways, orchids, step fields of\
  \ tea, some small bamboo houses with roofs made of tin, farmers carrying long grasses\
  \ placed in huge bamboo baskets tied to their backs, Tapi river, birds, butterflies,\
  \ insects, and the list is endless. Our silence breaks when a red panda comes out\
  \ of nowhere and goes somewhere into the dense forest. Rakesh (our best photographer)\
  \ clicks its picture, but it gets blurred. We all also try to capture but only the\
  \ trees! Everything seems great except for the part when the jeep halts so that\
  \ Nitesh could vomit after every five miles we covered! \nIt\u2019s 7:00 pm already\
  \ and we reach the beautiful village Pastanga and stay in Malinggo Homestay, cheap\
  \ enough for us. There we savour delicacies like momos, thupka, sinki soup, kinema\
  \ curry and take rest the entire night.\nThe next day it starts raining but stops\
  \ after a while and brings a vibrant rainbow along. The owner shows us the lovely\
  \ village, a mini waterfall, and amazing green fields. We meet locals, learn about\
  \ their culture, costumes, and cuisines; everything seems magical! Then we leave\
  \ for MG Market which is just 20kms away and shop everything that catches our eyes!\
  \ \nThe next day, off we go to the historical Enchey Monastery which was damaged\
  \ by an earthquake but still looks magnificent. Then we drive to the heavenly Banjhakri\
  \ waterfall where each drop of water sprinkling on us feels like washing away all\
  \ our pains. Later we head to Sikkim Himalayan zoological park where we cherish\
  \ a variety of flora and fauna.\n\nWe get ready for the next day's tour to Nathula\
  \ Pass located on the Old Silk Route that connects Sikkim to China\u2019s Tibet\
  \ Autonomous Region. We reach our dream destination and are checked for medical\
  \ fitness so that we don't have to struggle in higher altitudes. Luckily we all\
  \ pass the tests, and another adventure begins. All of us are awed to see the Indo-China\
  \ border where a thin wall divides the two countries. The soldiers on both the sides,\
  \ guarding their homeland and the national flag erupt patriotism in all the travellers.\
  \ Visiting idyllic Tsomogo lake, riding on yak, witnessing Baba Harbhajan Singh's\
  \ Memorial (hearing the soldier's heroic tale develops goosebumps on our skins)\
  \ was a phenomenal experience! We sing together, eat dried fruits and hot chocolate,\
  \ and play with the snow. The trip was a fantasy turned into a reality! The return\
  \ journey begins."
