Text: "\u201CYour good name, madam?\u201D\n\nThe man with the blonde highlights and\
  \ slick comb-back watches me in anticipation, eyeing this foreigner who clearly\
  \ has no intention of buying.\n\n\u201CWhere from, madam?\u201D he persists.\n\n\
  I did not come here to purchase plastic bangles, fake nose piercings or voluptuous\
  \ folds of sequined silk. I came, quite simply, to escape the madness. Ask any local,\
  \ they\u2019ll tell you that Old Delhi is a planet of its own. In Chandni Chowk,\
  \ one of the oldest markets in India, \u201Corder\u201D escapes the vocabulary altogether.\
  \ My dictionary of terms for weary travellers now includes:\n\nDriving on the correct\
  \ side: a mere suggestion, subject to interpretation \nRoad: an abstract concept;\
  \ all-in-one market, sidewalk, and local highway\nJewelry store: Purveyor of authentic\
  \ Indian jewelry made in China, cum sanctuary of Zen\n\nI have only myself to blame\
  \ for venturing into this maze at dusk, where mopeds nag the back of my shins, cows\
  \ and rickshaws pass inches from my face, and incessant honking is the symphony\
  \ to my evening stroll. But respite exists. You\u2019ll find it in the merchants\u2019\
  \ hovels, like this one, that line the treacherous alleyways. The men who sit below\
  \ their mountains of colourful fabric appear unruffled. Old eyes twinkle under the\
  \ glow of LEDs. Knobby fingers tinker with broken cell phones with surgical precision.\
  \ Inside these stores, a calm, industrious atmosphere prevails. Inches away, you\
  \ may be knocked out by a horse-drawn cart, but beyond the threshold where cobblestones\
  \ give way to linoleum, life is quite unhurried.\n\nI pick up a set of bangles and\
  \ twirl them between my fingers.\n\n\u201COne hundred rupees madam, special price,\u201D\
  \ chirps the assistant.\n\n\u201CEighty,\u201D I firmly reply.\n\nWhen heckling\
  \ for a price, never appear attached. (\u201CWalking away is the ultimate test,\u201D\
  \ I\u2019ve been told, \u201CIf they call you back, you\u2019ve won.\u201D) Like\
  \ a trained tourist, I nonchalantly gaze around the store. I might be a lost sheep\
  \ outside, but in here my position is certain. My eyes fall on the old man hovering\
  \ in the shadows. His tired face and droopy eyes seem to say, \u201CIs this really\
  \ a battle? Who came here seeking comfort, and what is to be won?\u201D\n\nI sigh\
  \ and turn to the assistant, who has now arranged six packets of similar sets for\
  \ me to examine. \n\nI offer him a sheepish smile. \u201CMy name is Rebecca. I\u2019\
  m from South Africa. What\u2019s your name?\u201D\n\nHe looks up in surprise. \u201C\
  My name is Saheed, madam.\u201D\n\n\u201CHow long have you been working here, Saheed?\u201D\
  \n\n\u201CSix months, madam. I am studying computer science but am not getting job,\
  \ so now I am helping Uncle with shop, madam. You know AB de Villiers?\u201D\n\n\
  Ah\u2026 the old AB card. Does this South African cricketer know that his name has\
  \ become a cultural bridge over which countless strangers traverse to establish\
  \ a fleeting sense of community? AB will crop up in about nine out of ten conversations\
  \ I have with locals, guaranteed. \n\n\u201CHe\u2019s our Sachin Tendulkar,\u201D\
  \ I laugh, \u201Cof course I know AB!\u201D\n\nDid I say something wrong? Saheed\
  \ stops his rummaging. His eyes widen and his mouth gapes open. \u201CUncle,\u201D\
  \ he calls out in excitement, \u201Cmadam knows AB de Villiers!\u201D\n\n\u201C\
  Acha!\u201D whoops the old man at the back. \u201CBest South African cricketer!\u201D\
  \n\nIt dawns on me that I\u2019ve been grossly misunderstood. I don\u2019t know\
  \ the first thing about AB -- or cricket, for that matter -- but the shining glee\
  \ that illuminates Saheed\u2019s face is priceless. Who would have thought that\
  \ the first two letters of the alphabet could morph into a symbol strong enough\
  \ to break tensions and build common ground? It\u2019s a gentle reminder that it\u2019\
  s in our nature to want to relate; to forge relationships on fragile beginnings.\
  \ I\u2019ve driven a tuk-tuk in Jaipur, marvelled at the Taj Mahal, tasted the best\
  \ biriyani in Hyderabad -- but nothing, nothing, comes close to moments like these\
  \ when walls crumble and preconceptions lay asunder. It transforms you every time.\n\
  \nI pick up two bangle sets and hand Saheed two hundred-rupee notes. I know I\u2019\
  ll never wear them - they\u2019re too small for my wrists. As I leave the store,\
  \ Saheed\u2019s voice follows me out the door, \u201Csay hello to AB for me, madam!\u201D"
