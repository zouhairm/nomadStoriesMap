Text: "Colorful and beautiful offerings on the streets, Buddhist temples in almost\
  \ every block, the sound of a hundred hectic motorbikes, small street food stands\
  \ selling satay, and two children coming my way whilst riding a bike. As they get\
  \ closer to me and we look at each other, I start noticing how a shy smile starts\
  \ to make its way onto their faces whilst I am suspecting they are onto something,\
  \ too. \u201CHello mister!\u201D is yelled at me in the friendliest way by the two\
  \ small boys that, for a second, made me go back to childhood memories. An unexpected\
  \ greeting and yet, not surprising given where I was.\n\nIt is my last day in Bali\
  \ and I am on a mission: walk/run 13 km to Denpasar airport, carrying a backpack,\
  \ in less than 3 hours. All the money I have left is equivalent to a coke, which\
  \ I do buy, and the clock is ticking. However, before those three hours start running,\
  \ I need to see someone before I leave. \n\nMr. Bali United is the nickname I had\
  \ given to a local Balinese, whom I befriended one week ago. The proud owner of\
  \ a laundry shop and proud supporter of, you guessed it, Bali United. On the day\
  \ we met and after communicating with heavy Italian level hand gestures, he assures\
  \ me that my clothes will be ready tomorrow. \u201CWhere you from?\u201D he suddenly\
  \ asks, as I was about to leave. \u201CM\xE9xico!\u201D is my enthusiastic response.\
  \ \u201COh! Good football! Rafael M\xE1rquez, Chicharito Hern\xE1ndez!\u201D he\
  \ replies, and I am happily shocked. It is funny how we now understand each other\
  \ perfectly as he impatiently looks for his phone to show me some pictures of his\
  \ beloved team. I had unexpectedly made a friend thanks to football and the need\
  \ for cleaning my clothes. The next day I come back and as I am reaching for money\
  \ Mr. Bali United surprises me yet again, \u201CNo, for you free!\u201D he says,\
  \ and I am speechless. Ultimately, he does not let me pay and all I could think\
  \ of is buying him something from the grocery store across the street, which he\
  \ does accepts and I am relieved. On my last day I say bid farewell to Mr. Bali\
  \ United with the promise of coming back. \n\nAlmost two hours have gone by and\
  \ I am not even halfway to the airport. I find myself walking on a major two-lane\
  \ freeway with no sidewalk, feeling cars and motorbikes passing by, literally, less\
  \ than one meter away from me. It is now clear to me. I am undoubtedly not making\
  \ it to the airport on time if I continue walking. However, in next to no time,\
  \ I see a tire repairshop and a truck trailer across the freeway. After crossing\
  \ on, what felt like, an Olympic 50 meter sprint, I search for the driver. The moment\
  \ I see him I rush towards him in desperate style. Even though the odds are clearly\
  \ not in my favor, my lifelong optimism kicks in. After saying \u201Cairport\u201D\
  \ god knows how many times, the driver seems to understand my request and makes\
  \ the \u201Chow much money do you have\u201D - sign, with his hands. \u201CNada\u201D\
  \ is my immediate response, as I make the \u201CI am hopeless and have no money\u201D\
  - sign. After experiencing an awkward pause, I simply thank the gentleman using,\
  \ repeatedly, the one word I had learned how to say in Balinese, \u201CSuksma!\u201D\
  \ \nThe gentleman, using his hands, tells me to wait and so I wait. I now see how\
  \ he walks towards the freeway, raises his hands, and stops a motorbike in less\
  \ than a minute. After discussing with the biker, I see how the truck driver pulls\
  \ money out of his pocket and gives it to the biker while he also points at me.\
  \ I am dumbfounded.  \n\nGenerosity and kindness simply do not do justice to the\
  \ people I saw on my last day in Bali. Two small boys riding a bike, a laundry shop\
  \ owner and a trruck driver make up for a memory of mine that shows the beauty of\
  \ our humanity and knows no age, no social class and no nationality. \n\nSuksama,\
  \ Bali."
