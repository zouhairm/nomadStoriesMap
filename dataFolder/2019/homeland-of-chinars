Text: "Listening to the static sound coming from his old radio placed carefully next\
  \ to his feet, Jameel rowed his boat through the backwaters of Dal Lake. He was\
  \ humming the tune of his favorite song. The sound of his hum and rhythm of the\
  \ oar were the only sounds one could hear on this misty evening, making the noise\
  \ coming from the radio fade away pretty much quickly from one's mind. Snow covered\
  \ the mountains of the Valley whereas fallen crimson leaves of the Chinar trees\
  \ painted a picture of a lingering Autumn that had overstayed. The sight beheld\
  \ a beauty of its own with nature mimicking the colors of war and peace as if the\
  \ colors knew it was alright to co-exist at the moment. As if they knew what tomorrow\
  \ was bringing. \n\nKashmir had been a disputed territory between India and Pakistan\
  \ and a war zone for almost 70 years now. Also called paradise on Earth by Mughal\
  \ emperor Jehangir in the 17th century, both the neighboring nations had fought\
  \ four wars over this piece of land, and the fifth didn\u2019t seem far away. Just\
  \ four days back both countries had engaged in aerial combats and then an uneasy\
  \ long silence had followed.  \n\nThe sudden voice of the news anchor from the radio\
  \ brought Jameel back from his thoughts. It was time for the local news bulletin.\
  \ The lady with a monotonous voice was narrating the ongoing events in the local\
  \ language. A thirteen-year-old boy had died in the crossfire in the North Kashmir\
  \ area. This news was about another internal war Kashmiris were fighting with India\
  \ and the Indian army which they believed to be the colonizers. Their houses burnt\
  \ to the ground. In other news, almost 250 Kashmiri students were sent back to their\
  \ homes in Kashmir from different parts of India. Jameel sighed and stared at the\
  \ floating weeds as if trying to make her voice fade again. He looked at me after\
  \ a while, his expression giving away his hesitancy. He spoke cautiously as if his\
  \ voice would shatter the calm but at the same time air too thick for him to stay\
  \ quiet. \n\u201CIs it the holiday season already there in Delhi, bubba? Or you\
  \ were missing home?\u2019. I could sense how he had masked the question \u201C\
  Did you return home because of the war?\u201D with politeness. Jameel had known\
  \ my family since my childhood. My brother and I would often go for rides in the\
  \ Dal on his boat or what he lovingly called Shikara. This tradition had stopped\
  \ almost five years back when I had moved to Delhi, the capital of India, for my\
  \ studies. So, for me to suddenly show up one day for the Shikara ride had taken\
  \ him by surprise. \n\u201CI had missed being home, Jameel. It has been a while.\u201D\
  \ I said. His question had suddenly made me feel an emotion I had kept at bay from\
  \ the last three days; the emotion of what it felt like to be without a home. I\
  \ had made Delhi home for five years only to return back to Kashmir with the feeling\
  \ of not having one. The same way the combat inflicted crisis had enforced homelessness\
  \ in Kashmir.. it had suddenly done in other parts of the country as well, for the\
  \ Kashmiris residing there. \n\nJameel let out a hefty chuckle and as if answering\
  \ his unasked question on my behalf said, \u201COne cannot abandon home, Bubba.\u201D\
  \n\nHe then went back to his humming. We rode in silence after that. The static\
  \ sound on the radio was back again and so was the hope of a return. A return to\
  \ homes, peace, and a winter full of snow."
