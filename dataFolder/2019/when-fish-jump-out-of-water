Text: "The sun burns my shoulders and I wear my sweat like a sweater. I linger on\
  \ the stone path towards the shrine. The sea is calling from my left, behind the\
  \ lush green trees. Below the trunks it\u2019s boulders all the way down, streaked\
  \ with the shadows of the trees. When the boulders reach the water, they sit like\
  \ giant bread crumbs baked orange.\n\n\nI leave the stone path to make my own. Every\
  \ step is a game of choice. Hop, hop, steady step and hop. The camera strap clings\
  \ around my neck for dear life. Such is a photographer\u2019s life. Dad told me\
  \ to protect the camera like a little sister, and he would disown me if he ever\
  \ found out I jump over water with her dangling for mercy. \n\n\nThat\u2019s when\
  \ I see her, standing up on the furthest boulder by the water\u2019s edge. She swings\
  \ her fishing rod with a practiced grace.Wearing a rice farmer\u2019s hat, she's\
  \ dressed in pink that screams against the great wild blue of the sea.\n\nTwo sides\
  \ wrestle within me. The photographer is twitching to keep this moment but the traveler\
  \ holds her down, knowing that taking some moments for later can hold it hostage\
  \ from the present. \n\nI watch her with admiration, feeling alien in a private\
  \ world. I don\u2019t belong here. I think of my family, always hiding in shopping\
  \ malls. This corner of Hong Kong is too beautiful not to explore, but sometimes\
  \ my throat still tightens when l encounter a local. The openness I felt back home\
  \ doesn\u2019t follow me around the world.\n\n\nI tiptoe away, careful not to disturb\
  \ the concentration of a master. I reach the bend where the island\u2019s trail\
  \ of rocky crumbs curves away. Lingering, I wonder what her story is. Does she come\
  \ here every day?\n\nShe turns. My heart flops in my chest, but the shyness melts\
  \ at the shine of her smile. I give her a small wave and she lifts a silver bucket\
  \ towards me. In scratchy Cantonese, she says I\u2019m a long way from the other\
  \ tourists. I mumble to her that it's a beautiful spot to fish. If she catches my\
  \ shakiness, she doesn't show it. Pulling me into easy conversation, her voice twangs\
  \ like a guitar string pulled too hard. I learn she lives just along the coast,\
  \ and how much more fish she caught in one hour this morning than the past five\
  \ hours.\n\nShe asks me if I\u2019ve seen fish jump out of the water. I shake my\
  \ head. She tells me to come, pulling out a black phone. She says her friend sent\
  \ her this video just a day ago. Angling from the glare of the sun, I look at the\
  \ shaky footage on the screen. There are yelps and hollers and whoas as endless\
  \ silver fish leap onto the dock like a wave. Although the water is murky and black,\
  \ the fish reflect the moon as they fling themselves out of the sea. It's as though\
  \ they are escaping fire. The person behind the camera backs away, showing fish\
  \ pouring in from all sides. Others on the dock are running away, while some stay\
  \ to record.\n\nI look up from the chaos in her phone to the clear seas behind her.\
  \ It looks so calm it could be a sheet, even though the past few days have gotten\
  \ windier.\n\nThe typhoon is coming, she tells me. When I head back to our apartment,\
  \ I meet another lady who shows me the same video. \n\nIn four days it comes. I\
  \ hide with my family, playing cards inside. From our window, we can see uprooted\
  \ trees and deserted taxis. The wind howls so loud, it echoes. In the news, street\
  \ signs fly in the sky and construction buildings tumble. Luckily Hong Kong escapes\
  \ the worst of it.\n\nWhen it ends, I leave the apartment feeling light. I look\
  \ around at the debris and wonder who I\u2019ll meet next. If fish can jump out\
  \ of water, I can talk to anyone."
