Text: "A nauseating screech roars up the escalators from the dim-lit depths of the\
  \ Tbilisi underground. I attempt to clutch onto my tightly duct-taped suitcase,\
  \ but I\u2019m propelled off the escalator and stumble outside into the thick afternoon\
  \ haze of pollution which permanently veils the city. A group of school children\
  \ tut as I sluggishly heave my luggage across the pothole ridden road. With no pedestrian\
  \ crossings, I do as all Georgians do; I brashly walk into the middle of peak-hour\
  \ traffic and hope that a forceful gaze will prompt the drivers to stop. The Soviet-era\
  \ cars swerve around me and force me into a game of dodgem.\nI head towards a row\
  \ of Mercedes mini vans which stand out amongst the swarm of rusting Soviet-era\
  \ cars. My eyes catch the stony face of a full-bodied, balding man who leans against\
  \ the drivers side of one van, smoothly puffing cigarette smoke towards the mid-winter\
  \ sun.\n\nIn many contexts, a young girl approaching an elderly man driving a white\
  \ minivan is a horror story waiting to happen. In this context, it\u2019s my only\
  \ way to Armenia. His spare leathery hand jingles a set of keys in front of my face\
  \ and he croaks in his Armenian accent \u201C35 lari.\u201D After the usual minute\
  \ or two of translation charades, I empty my wallet and jump into the van.\nBefore\
  \ I have any chance to slump into my seat and bask in the scent of melted cheese\
  \ and potato stewing inside the lobiani I bought, the van jolts forward and joins\
  \ the sea of yellow marshrutkas carting Tbilisians to their homes for dinnertime.\n\
  \nThe driver grabs my attention via the rear-view mirror and points to a stocky\
  \ man wearing a weathered leather jacket and a bejewelled crucifix around his neck.\
  \ \u201CSchool friend!\u201D he says before flashing his stained teeth with pride.\
  \ They laugh heartily together for most of the trip. \n\nThe rows of identical,\
  \ crumbling apartment blocks from the Soviet era fade and the mountainous countryside\
  \ emerges. The driver applies pressure to the peddle and he fearlessly takes over\
  \ every single car which appears in front of us.\n\nI attempt to capture the ever-present\
  \ and the ghostly aura it creates over the farmland on my camera, but I only capture\
  \ blurs. Wide motorways suddenly become tight, winding roads which hug the rocky\
  \ cliffsides. Semi-trailers now appear from the opposite side of the road. Whilst\
  \ I pray that he doesn\u2019t dare try to overtake the car ahead of us as a ten-ton\
  \ truck approaches (spoiler: he does) his school friend in the passenger seat is\
  \ fast asleep, snoring in fact.\n\nWe pass the border into Armenia and immediately\
  \ the road becomes bumpier. The blanket of smog looks denser than ever as the night\
  \ falls over mountains. We zoom past decaying villages which are guarded by stray\
  \ dogs and local men who spend their evenings chatting and smoking at the local\
  \ petrol stations.\n\n Each village tells a distinct story of Armenia\u2019s horrifying\
  \ past; a corroded ferris wheel towers over one, while in the next village, a closed\
  \ factory adorned with the hammer and sickle sits eerily beside a row of village\
  \ houses. \n\nI begin to think about my driver and his friend\u2019s pasts. Does\
  \ his childhood village still exist? Did they lose friends and family?\n\nAn hour\
  \ after pondering this, the driver abruptly pulls the van over and ushers me out.\
  \ His friend follows. My eyes adjust to the night sky and before me stands a memorial\
  \ covered in disintegrating photos and fake flowers. \n\nBoth men attempt to translate\
  \ why we have stopped here, but they don\u2019t need to. I see faces which resemble\
  \ that of both men. I see in their own faces a restrained sense of anguish and torment.\
  \ The cold becomes unbearable and after a grief stricken hug they return to the\
  \ van. \n\nNo longer do I look out the window for valleys and frozen lakes or smoke\
  \ bellowing from the chimneys in each village we pass. I now sit in awe at the sight\
  \ of two best friends who without telling me the specifics of their stories, have\
  \ sparked a fascination in me regarding Armenia\u2019s past and present through\
  \ one pitstop."
