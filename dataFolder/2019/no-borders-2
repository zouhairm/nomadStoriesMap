Text: I have travelled singapore recently. I learned many things there. I stayed in
  hostel cambell in ferrer park and people around the world used to live there and
  that was the first time in my life that i stayed there. Initially i met a boy and
  a girl from israel. We become good friends in 2 days we roaming around together
  at night i tried their food and they both love indian food. We used to share our
  cultures adtelling stories and history about our country. And in 3rd day we al met
  a guy from egypt . He is an accountant and his is an intern there. I speak to him
  and we had a great time together as we used to share our currency and telling the
  value of our currency. Then we met 3 guys from ghana. All of us become very good
  friends and ftom them i came to know that they all want to fo business in india.
  Then i met a spanish girl. She is very polite in nature andd working as a cabin
  crew in some airline. We clicked pictures and spend good time together and know
  each other' s cultures. We used to eat in one plate no racism no discrimination.
  People having diffrent cultures different skin are together at that time. And on
  other hand we people are fighting with each other in our countries. So i suggest
  that we should travel and explore the different parts of the world so that we can
  find to much of love. So spread love travel and forget about the borders because
  we all are same and having same souls and have red blood.
