Text: "I hear a short shout, followed by eerie quietness, and then, suddenly, a stampede\
  \ of footsteps accompanied by a crescendo of bickering voices. Typical.\n \nFrom\
  \ the age of eleven I have spent most of my time away from home. It\u2019s the same\
  \ with my siblings. Get-togethers come around rarely, but when they do, there is\
  \ always an initial overwhelming moment where we re-adjust ourselves back into a\
  \ family of six. Christmas 2018 was one of these occasions. For five days only,\
  \ we would all be together in India, for the holidays. We decided to mark the occasion\
  \ with a trip to the UNESCO World Heritage site of Hampi, in Northern Karnataka,\
  \ a six-hour drive from Bangalore.\n \nWe opted to drive ourselves through the merciless\
  \ roads of India. Our car, to make things worse, is an American model, so not only\
  \ were we tackling the order-less mania, we were doing so on the wrong side of the\
  \ road, adding to the already perilous journey ahead. Nevertheless, we were ready.\
  \ Our first stop: the bazaar.\n\nWe arrived into a bombardment of life. Dyes everywhere,\
  \ piled high with an angle of repose any geologist would be jealous of. The colours:\
  \ bright and vibrant, block printed against the homogenous clear blue sky. Women\
  \ sat feeding their children whilst supervising their stands, yelling inaudibly\
  \ at the innocent tourists trying to make their way through the marketplace. Pandemonium\
  \ had sprung out at the far end as one shop keeper accused another of stealing their\
  \ customers. Desperate street sellers loitered, eagle eyed, ready to launch themselves\
  \ at the next unsuspecting traveller. \u201CMiss, buy this drum\u201D, \u201Cvery\
  \ good quality, Miss\u201D \u201Cyou try. Try drum Miss\u201D they all urged simultaneously.\
  \ Other sellers appeared, someone thrusts a necklace into my hand. \u201CReal gems\
  \ Miss, look. Very real\u201D. I hold the necklace, not knowing what to do with\
  \ it. My hands are beginning to sweat. My heart is racing. The sellers won\u2019\
  t leave us alone. A high pitched ringing begins to sound as the world around me\
  \ slowly muffles. I thrust the jewellery back to its owner as I try to push away,\
  \ holding my sister\u2019s hand as I go. I urgently look for an exit, away from\
  \ the commotion, but it wasn\u2019t going to happen. I am in India, an electrifying\
  \ country where calmness is as foreign a concept as road rules.\n\nAs we waded through\
  \ the sea of people, we found ourselves at the bottom of a large, rather intimidating\
  \ flight of stone stairs. The hills surrounding Hampi are piled high with boulders\
  \ in all shapes and sizes, and look strategically positioned as if to barricade\
  \ in the ancient temples. With nothing to lose, we opted to climb up the stairs\
  \ to the unknown, away from the crowds and the tours below. We ducked and manoeuvred\
  \ our way through the crumbling ruins of smaller temples as the steps took us higher\
  \ and higher. As we gradually made it to the top, with yet more jagged rocks around\
  \ us, we were welcomed with a site to behold. Beneath us, and in the distance, lay\
  \ the dusty remains of the Achyutaraya Temple and its surrounding complex, basking\
  \ in the balmy afternoon sun, as if resting, peacefully, stuck in time. \n\nThe\
  \ six of us stood there in awe. Not only were we mesmerised by the shear existence\
  \ of the view, but the extraordinary fact we could share it together, as a family.\
  \ The calmness of the moment was a stark contrast to the chaos we had escaped from\
  \ just minutes earlier. The place was deserted. Minutes pass as we all savoured\
  \ the moment. The unfamiliar tranquillity of the Indian landscape was awe-inspiring;\
  \ where finally in the still silence, I was able to calmly exhale. \n\nThe serenity\
  \ of the moment is suddenly broken. \n \n\u201CHampi Christmas\u201D my sister yells\
  \ towards the open view.\n\nWe roll our eyes at her and laugh."
