Text: "In 2009, my dad celebrated his 60th birthday by traveling to Egypt. \n\nMy\
  \ two aunts and I traveled with him to help him celebrate. It was an incredible\
  \ experience but the part that really connected for me was when we were sailing\
  \ on the Nile River, we stopped at a local river village to tour their little island.\
  \ My dad and I found our way to a gathering of kids being kids and we decided to\
  \ see what the kids were up to. \n\nMy dad is a watercolor artist, amateur gourmet\
  \ chef, and former elementary school principal. He enjoys connecting with people\
  \ on universal levels like play, food, and art. In the two hours we were on this\
  \ island village, my dad befriended every child there by connecting his youthful\
  \ spirit with theirs. \n\nAlthough my dad doesn't speak their language, he was able\
  \ to teach them rock-paper-scissors through patient gestures and lots smiles and\
  \ thumbs up. I have never seen my dad laughing and enjoying himself as much as he\
  \ did in those two hours and even ten years later, it is one of the first things\
  \ I think of when I recall that vacation. \n\nThe smiles from all the kids and the\
  \ parents that were watching caught on like wildfire and before we knew it - 30+\
  \ kids were involved. He even managed to make sure the shy kids, the ones that stood\
  \ near the back and observed, were invited to enjoy the game. \n\nIt was also the\
  \ freest I've seen his spirit, except for the few times I've caught him painting.\
  \ My dad is a baby boomer raised in by parents born in the depression. He struggles\
  \ to share emotions with his children (my brother and I) which has been a source\
  \ of frustration for me as I attempt to model a healthier approach for my own adult\
  \ life. I believe for my generation (gen X and xennials) this is a common problem.\
  \ \n\nThe masculine energy of the world is changing, and I strongly believe in a\
  \ very positive way. My dad connected to his emotions via painting. I connected\
  \ to my dad via our travel adventures together and I learned to talk about my emotions\
  \ through writing.\n\nMy dad is getting to the age where travel is becoming harder\
  \ for him. He instilled in me a profound appreciation for travel and not just the\
  \ tourist ideals often marketed to people. He showed me the value in immersion in\
  \ a culture as a form of personal freedom.\n\nI would love to travel and write about\
  \ this concept/idea. I would love to honor my dad and when the opportunity presents\
  \ itself, I would love to travel with him wherever and whenever possible. He actually\
  \ has been to Portugal. I would love to try following in his footsteps and retrace\
  \ his adventures there. I would write about how travel is one of the most important\
  \ ways I connect to my own identity because my passion for travel is a direct gift\
  \ from my parents and it would make me very proud to discuss it through travel writing."
