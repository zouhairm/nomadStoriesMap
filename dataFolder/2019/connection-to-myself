Text: "We can\u2019t deny that all trip change a little of us, but there\u2019re some\
  \ whose changes us a lot. Travel is a search, and in that trip I found the most\
  \ important thing in the world, myself. Known as \u201CQueen of the lakes\u201D\
  \ Capit\xF3lio is the precious of Brazilian southeastern. Is paradisiacal place\
  \ and makes you feel like never before. There are canyons, surrounded by huge walls,\
  \ whose was flooded, forming natural pools of crystalline green waters, the biggest\
  \ water mirror of the world.\nWas a hard moment in my life, and I used to not believe\
  \ in myself, or that I could do something by myself and contrary all the expectations\
  \ watch such immensity made me feel better. Better because you feel so small and\
  \ insignificant person who starts to see life with other eyes.\nThere you have several\
  \ options of tours, for all tastes, whose is everything in the middle of nature.\
  \ There are many waterfalls and paradisiacal landscapes that leave anyone fascinated,\
  \ but in my opinion, the best is undoubtedly the \"Para\xEDso Perdido\" (Lost Paradise)\
  \ a place which you go through a beautiful adventure before reaching the destination.\
  \ First there is a trail that can be done by car, then there is a sudden steepness\
  \ that can only be done on foot, as it is in a kind of wide and slippery waterfall,\
  \ which makes many give up the climb.\nFor sure the popular saying teaches us that\
  \ \u201Cthe main one on a hike is the way and not exactly the arrival\u201D, but\
  \ in that case I have to disagree. Although the path consists of a wonderful landscape\
  \ - about 4 waterfalls and natural pools - the arrival is the best. It is so beautiful\
  \ and lovely that it makes us understand the name of the place, it really is a paradise.\
  \ Do you know that place you come in and just want to sit and admire? That\u2019\
  s the one. If I close my eyes now, I can still hear the noise of nature and see\
  \ the most beautiful sight my eyes have ever seen. The sound of the water falling\
  \ and beating so hard and powerful on the rocks, the birds in the trees, that silence\
  \ of nature that is sometimes the only thing that can take away all the pain and\
  \ anguish of our hearts.\nOn top of all that, there was still a cliff-like landscape,\
  \ you've reached everything. It's like reestablishing, reconnecting, loving yourself\
  \ again.\nDo you know that madness that we do in adult life, enjoying our independence\
  \ and knowing that if your mother was there you could not do it? That sense of freedom\
  \ and who is doing something wrong for the first time in life. That's what I felt\
  \ when I got there on top of that cliff. And that's why every time I feel disconnected,\
  \ too adult, too sad, I try to feel small again front all the immensity of our world."
