Text: "Since I was about six or seven, I\u2019ve been hugely fascinated with traveling\
  \ to Egypt. \n\nDid you ever see the movie Jewel of the Nile? The 1985 flick, starring\
  \ Michael Douglas and Kathleen Turner, is the sequel to the movie, Romancing the\
  \ Stone. Seeing this movie, and their adventure on the Nile, is what prompted my\
  \ desire to see the African nation. My wanderlust, as a whole, was largely birthed\
  \ and impacted by books and cinema.\n\nSo\u2026here I am-my husband alongside-fulfilling\
  \ a life-long dream to explore the sights, sounds, and tastes of this land, rich\
  \ with history. One doesn\u2019t have to be there long, however, before the very\
  \ in-your-face reality of Egypt\u2019s widespread poverty hits. Tourism, the means\
  \ that many Egyptian citizens provide for their families, has drastically fallen\
  \ since the 2011 revolution. Though being swarmed with sellers, of all ages, at\
  \ every tourist attraction was a bit overwhelming at times, it was nothing we couldn\u2019\
  t handle. It was nothing that took away from the joy of our trip.\n\nI fully expected\
  \ to be awed and amazed by the Pyramids of Giza. And I was. They were simply magnificent.\
  \ Touching the Great Pyramid for the first time was breathtaking and surreal. It\
  \ is a moment I will never forget and will forever be grateful for.\n\nWhat I did\
  \ not expect was Ahmed.\n\nThomas and I were exiting Edfu Temple when approached\
  \ by a handsome young man selling bracelets. After each \u201Cno, thank you\u201D\
  \ he sweetened the deal, increasing the number of bracelets. Eventually, he offered\
  \ all 12 he had for a mere three dollars. I offered him $2.00 for 4 of the wooden\
  \ beetle bracelets, strung on cheap rubber cords with already tarnishing metal accents.\
  \ He thanked us and we continued our exit. Ahmed followed, wanting to shake my hand.\
  \ He walked with us all the way to the carriage depot, talking to us and asking\
  \ me questions. When he could have been selling to other exiting tourists, he stayed,\
  \ getting to know his new friends. In such contrast to our interactions with other\
  \ sellers, that was quite profound to me. When I told him that we were from the\
  \ U.S. he replied, \u201CNumber one. The best.\u201D (That\u2019s a whole other\
  \ post, lol!) He asked how many children we had and look of amazement graced his\
  \ face when I answered five. He had such a sweet face and a beautiful smile.\n\n\
  Before we left, he asked for my hand and tried to put a bracelet on me. I told him\
  \ that I had enough and to keep the rest to sell. \u201CA gift for you,\u201D he\
  \ says. I let him gift it to me and place it on my wrist, then we took a picture\
  \ together. He accompanied us to the carriage, giving us high fives, and asked my\
  \ husband\u2019s name while we boarded. \u201CNice to meet you, Thomas.\u201D\n\n\
  And then, we were off.\n\nPeople. Connection. Memories. Spreading love. THAT\u2019\
  S what life is about! I will never see Ahmed again. I may not always remember his\
  \ name or even his sweet face. But I will always remember the encounter and how\
  \ it made me feel.\n\nSweet Ahmed."
