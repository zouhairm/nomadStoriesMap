Text: "The trees throw camouflage over a ridiculous amount of potholes on our winding\
  \ road across an expansive green landscape, slowing us down for a slideshow of contrast\
  \ and visual wonder.\nDriving in Mexico is an adventure in itself.  There\u2019\
  s a horse on the back of a pick-up truck, a field of pure white cows, a family of\
  \ three on a motorcycle towing a family of four uphill, also on a motorcycle.  We\u2019\
  re passed by license plate \"Jesus\" on a narrow and imaginary inside lane, rolled\
  \ through a town selling only pineapples... stalls, and stalls of pineapples, a\
  \ place where fruit, sewage and diesel battle for dominance of our olfactory sense.\
  \  \nWelcome to Tabasco, the home of cacao, sugarcane, melting Mariachis and flaming\
  \ towers of oil 'sploitation.\nThis is not a tourist town.\n\nI'm traveling with\
  \ Baron Hasselhoff, lover of chocolate from Wellington New Zealand.  His life long\
  \ dream is to visit the birthplace of his passion, and with some \"dulce suerte\"\
  \ (sweet luck) and many miles of Spanglish, we find ourselves on the doorstep of\
  \ a rarely visited biodynamic cacao homestead, Finca Cholula.\nWe're on the hacienda\
  \ patio in our rocking chairs overlooking a tiled bouquet of tropical flowers, and\
  \ despite the heat and anticipation of finally visiting a traditional cacao plantation,\
  \ the feeling is mighty relaxed as we wait for our host.\n\nAna Marina lights up\
  \ with enthusiasm when talking about cacao, making her more beautiful now than in\
  \ the many wooden frames displayed in the foyer of yesteryears beauty pageant glory.\
  \  \nThe farm was founded in 1802,  Grandpa Cholula bought it in 1914, but cacao\
  \ \"the food of the gods\" has been here since the dawn of time.\nThis place is\
  \ steeped in the sacred culture of cacao connection.\n\nAs we enter the plantation,\
  \ Ana Marina points out a family of howler monkeys in the forest canopy that moved\
  \ in when she was a little girl.\n\"There is no organic certification, fair trade\
  \ agreements, or biodynamic recognition.  All of these things cost money and time,\
  \ and we don't receive any more for the trouble.\"\nOur seal of organic approval\
  \ is the flora & fauna you see around you, the butterflies, bees and botanical variety.\n\
  Walking through 13 different species of cacao is extraordinary.   The canopy provides\
  \ shade for the flavors of the future and function of a dynamic forest.\nAt the\
  \ forest floor, we are shown a variety of edible and medicinal plants,  prompting\
  \ rich descriptions of recipes with ingredients available at our fingertips.\n Biodiversity\
  \ is the wolf of cacao; it guards against predators and disease, protects our native\
  \ strains and natural ecology.\n\"The people are moving away from this, buying leaves\
  \ from supermarkets for their tamales for example.\"  \n \n\nThe cacao fruit is\
  \ the size of a small football ripened to the shades of Fall, the seeds revealed\
  \ inside are sweet and filmy.  Fermented in the actual canoe that carried her Grandpapa\
  \ here through miles of mangroves, dried on the front porch her father built, roasted\
  \ in genius converted oil drums her brothers make.\n\nWe laugh, conversate and empathize\
  \ over the state of the Mexican chocolate industry, how it's rife with advice and\
  \ prospecting from  European multinationals like Nestle.\nGlobalization brings us\
  \ cacao, but it dilutes the traditional ways, the ancient Olmecs traded in Cacao\
  \ before gold, this is the home of chocolate.\n\"Cacao is not a commodity; it's\
  \ not a market; this is our culture.\" European chocolate is a sub product, it still\
  \ has value, it's still yummy, but how dare they bully the market into believing\
  \ there is just one taste, only one style.  Eating a bar of it makes no sense here,\
  \ it would melt.   Cacao is ceremonial; it represents diversity and life cycles.\
  \ In Mayan creation mythology, humans are partially composed of cacao! \n\nWe tried\
  \ the beans whole, in a pulp, as an exfoliant for our face, a moisturizer for our\
  \ hands.  Mama Cholula prepared a drink for us from the paste with a little sugar,\
  \ cinnamon, and water.  There is an air of ceremony while we drink our chocolate,\
  \ it's smooth, sweet & refreshing with the promise of getting a little bit high.\
  \  \nWe left with a feeling of dulce suerte.  \"That was spiritual baby.\""
