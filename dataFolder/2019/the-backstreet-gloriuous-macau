Text: "I never expect to spent so many days in Macau, until my flight to Taipei from\
  \ Hongkong canceled and the good price for another ticket its another 5 days. Most\
  \ of travel journal state, you can just easy travel one day to Macau from Hongkong.\
  \ Go around by all the shuttle from casino that easy provide from tourist. Its can\
  \ be done in one day.\n\nI been to Hongkong a couples time and decide to not to\
  \ stay in Hongkong and  just accepted Macau whatever that will happend, because\
  \ is the easy and close another place beside Hongkong.\n\nSince accomodation in\
  \ Macau its quite expensive for my wallet, i stay in peripery Macau area, near china\
  \ border, place where local people staying. Not in the middle of Macau stellar,\
  \ casino.\n\nBased on history, Macau its quite unique, have Portugal culture in\
  \ Chinese land. The things that never happend in anywhere. The whole area from Macau\
  \ from edge to edge can be explored by foot just in 3 hours. \n\nBeen to Macau Tower\
  \ and all casino that happening in tourist book guidence, make me spent a lot time\
  \ to explore all the alleyway in Macau.\nBreakfast with Portuguese way and drink\
  \ tea in Chinese way. I never expected my self to walk along one country in 3 hours.\
  \ But in the end since i start walk then suddenly its finish to another end of country.\
  \ If you going to north actually its abit hard because the geographical its uphil.\
  \ So if you decide to walk, better its from north to south. Or you can use bus,\
  \ the famous local public transportation.\n\nBecause Macau is one of the country\
  \ that doenst have debt make transportation in Macau its quite cheap.\n\nMacau its\
  \ not just casino. Macau always be a side dish of Hongkong destination. But if you\
  \ push back a bit to north far away from casino and all the glamorious Macau tower.\
  \ You can find another face of Macau. Acculturate Chinese and Portuguese culture.\
  \ You can find big plaza suddenly while you walking in back alleyway. \n\nSpent\
  \ one or two days in one place, i dont think i can state that i been to \"there\"\
  . At least 4-5 days after all the internet information been listed done, you can\
  \ find another gems and something that you never be expected. Its always nice to\
  \ not have expectation and list and find a good things. The deposit of small happiness\
  \ and easy target achievement."
