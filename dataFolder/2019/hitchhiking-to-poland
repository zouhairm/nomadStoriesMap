Text: "We get boarded to a ferry at Newcastle upon Tyne, ferry was about to sail to\
  \ Amsterdam, we paid much less than for plane tickets and also had breakfast included.\
  \ Just after sail we started to walk around the deck to see what's up. When it went\
  \ to dusk manage to sleep. We woke up about 5am and went to canteen for a breakfast\
  \ asap to make a reservation for the table next to windows with a seawiev. We could\
  \ take as many as we wanted so I started to make sandwiches for travel. Without\
  \ rush we spent rest of journey at breakfast until 10 while we made it.\nAmsterdam\
  \ was ahead, later in the city centre we've spotted a lot of tourists but also residents,\
  \ i've never seen city so well organised about traffic, cars, trams, buses, bicycles\
  \ train and boats, all of these were possible ways to move around the city, and\
  \ it was really enjoying to chill and be a witness of life in Amsterdam. Because\
  \ a lot of people there speaking English very well we didn't foundo any issues with\
  \ asking for directions, problems started appear when j realized that my mate wasn't\
  \ speaking German at all, so everything was on my own to communicate. First day\
  \ of travel finished just before nijmegen which is really nice town to visit. At\
  \ the afternoon we left nijmegen and crossed the border, finding ourselves in town\
  \ of kleve. In kleve we meet first Polish lads during our hitchhiking,  they luckily\
  \ were livng in this town, they helped us go find some cheap shop, after doing quick\
  \ supply we managed to move further regardless of going late, after another hours\
  \ we realized that heading to town of Goch wasn't really good idea because there\
  \ was no way to get east from here, we stuck in dead zone, however I was never going\
  \ to give up! At service we met another couple of hitchhikers who told us everything\
  \ we needed we had a stories to tell and informations to trade, due to be dad we\
  \ managed to spent night together with a campfire, next morning we went to close\
  \ lake and took a bath there, water was wonderfully warm, however time was most\
  \ valuable resource due to issue with crossing the Rein. It took us couple hours\
  \ to get back to Goch, then back to kleve to get to emerich um rein. When we crossed\
  \ the river we easily found someone who lifted us straight to Poland, in meantime\
  \ I had opportunity to visit pozna\u0144, and take a nostalgic walk around city,\
  \ due to staying there for a couple hours I decided to visit my friend there who\
  \ helped me to get where I was about to get. Thanks to him and all drivers who stopped\
  \ their cars and lifted us we get there just in time"
