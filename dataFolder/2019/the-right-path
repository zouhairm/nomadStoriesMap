Text: "I hail from a rural area located in the North Eastern part Kenya called Garissa.\
  \ I was surrounded by livestock since my communities are pastarolist. We move from\
  \ one place to another insearch of pastures and water. Our way on the move we came\
  \ across wild animals and we had to protect our Cattles from the deadly lions and\
  \ hyenas. After many years of movement,i had opportunity to join university in the\
  \ coastal region of Kenya a city called Mombasa. Mombasa is an island connected\
  \ to the mainland by bridges and ferries. The town overlooks a wide harbor, where\
  \ commercial shipping mingles with traditional sailing dhows.\n\nThe true heart\
  \ of Mombasa is found in the exotic old town, among the narrow winding streets and\
  \ Arab architecture. The air here is always heavy with the scent of spices.\n\n\
  At the water\u2019s edge is Fort Jesus, an imposing fort that stands watch over\
  \ the harbor.\n\nThe high gun turrets, battlements and underground passages of this\
  \ 16th Century Fort were the centre of a historic struggle for control of the Kenya\
  \ coast between the Portuguese army and the Shirazi Arabs. This war was waged around\
  \ Mombasa over hundreds of years and countless battles, and the Fort stands as a\
  \ testament to this tumultuous past.\nI had memorable days in Mombasa with full\
  \ of fun. These includes:swimming with dolphins at wasini island, scuber diving,\
  \ Swahili culture, beach walk, Mombasa night life and sky diving in diani. \nI traveled\
  \ locally to Nairobi, naivasha and kisumu .i had great time, interacted with different\
  \ kind of people with different cultures. I shared pictures with my friends on instagram\
  \ which earned me nickname 'vacation king'.I had good time and still there's a lot\
  \ to come."
