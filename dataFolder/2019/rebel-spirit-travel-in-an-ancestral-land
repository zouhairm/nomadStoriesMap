Text: "In early 2018, I spent two months in Ireland and Northern Ireland researching\
  \ and writing about rebelliousness in Irish literary and political culture. As I\
  \ moved from east to north, to west and then south, the language politics grew more\
  \ interesting. I discovered materials in the National Archive about my rebellious\
  \ great aunt, who was a member of Cumman na mBan and involved in the 1916 Easter\
  \ Rising in Dublin and the subsequent War of Independence.\n\nThis project is about\
  \ traveling in your ancestral land and making discoveries about who you really are,\
  \ about the past that made your life possible. It explores the difference between\
  \ objective knowledge that has been passed down through the generations, and its\
  \ real-life implications - in this case, seeing the result of the early twentieth-century\
  \ rebels' work in Ireland. The piece blends the travel writing spirit of Bill Bryson\
  \ and Paul Theroux with family and national memoir to consider my place as a visitor\
  \ to Ireland as a dual citizen and member of the sweeping and complex Irish diaspora.\
  \ \n\nAs a master\u2019s dissertation, Rebel Spirit was awarded a high distinction\
  \ by the University of Sydney\u2019s English Department in December 2018. I am now\
  \ working to expand it to a full manuscript.\n\n\n(I have other travel pieces in\
  \ the works, taking in Nepal, Bolivia and Thailand. As a graduate of anthropology\
  \ and a nomad and travel nut, my stories delve deeply into social and cultural issues.\
