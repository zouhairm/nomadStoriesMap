Text: "I am bustling along a city street, shuffling my feet in an orderly fashion,\
  \ daring not to deviate from the crowds path. We\u2019re moving towards the famous\
  \ Shibuya Crossing and given that it is more commonly known as \u2018The Scramble\u2019\
  , I expect total disarray. Thousands of people and cars rushing in different directions\
  \ is bound for complete disorder. Instead, I find controlled chaos which is strange\
  \ considering up to 2,500 people can cross this intersection at any one time. Unlike\
  \ other busy cities, the mood in Tokyo is peaceful and pleasant. \n\nI move through\
  \ the crowd of nameless faces, marvelling at the city\u2019s gritty beauty. The\
  \ sky is awash with grey, which I soon realise is typical for Japan. The buildings\
  \ dominate the landscape and the colour is provided not by nature, but by neon lights.\
  \ They blink and they glow before me, bursting with vibrancy and a language that\
  \ I can\u2019t understand. In addition to these neon signs, the colour of Tokyo\
  \ is provided by the people. They pace through the city adorned with animated outfits,\
  \ quirky hairstyles and kitsch accessories. As far as the Japanese people go, they\
  \ are typically quiet, yet loud when it comes to expressing themselves through fashion.\
  \  \n\nIn Harajuku this aspect of the Japanese culture is amplified, with \u2018\
  Harajuku Girls\u2019 living up to their namesake by parading their dress sense as\
  \ if it\u2019s a work of art. Not surprisingly, I meet two girls, both dressed in\
  \ clashing patterns, platform shoes and clips in their hair. When I ask for their\
  \ names, they respond in unison with the word \u2018Harajuku\u2019. I try to explain\
  \ that I am asking for their personal names, but they insist. So it\u2019s here\
  \ that I meet \u2018Harajuku 1\u2019 and \u2018Harajuku 2\u2019.\n\nJapan is the\
  \ land of the quirky, with hedgehog caf\xE9s and toilets that play the sounds of\
  \ the ocean when you\u2019re doing your business. Seemingly convenient functions\
  \ have been infiltrated into their daily life, serving it up to you with a dose\
  \ of strange, yet fun. It\u2019s the land of the unpredictable and just when you\
  \ think you\u2019ve got it all figured out, it will go ahead and surprise you. \n\
  \nAt times I feel lost in translation, struggling with the language barrier. I order\
  \ fries expecting something resembling hot chips, but I am served up cold, toffee-covered\
  \ potatoes instead (which, if you\u2019re wondering, are delicious). Or I point\
  \ to the pumpkin soup on the menu, only to be served a desert of cold, pumpkin-flavoured\
  \ cr\xE8me brulee (again, very delicious). \n\nThe Japanese culture has sucked me\
  \ in and spat me out like one of their numerous vending machines. I seek out a vending\
  \ machine serving soft drinks and I\u2019m not sure why I am surprised, but out\
  \ pops a canned, hot coffee instead. Further up the road there is a machine producing\
  \ origami kits for less than a dollar, and for dinner I order my meal through \u2013\
  \ you guessed it - a vending machine.\n\nJapan is a constant source of amusement\
  \ and excitement, except if you find yourself lost at night with a dead phone battery.\
  \ I wander the streets for hours, desperately trying to pronounce the name of my\
  \ ryokan or trace back my steps from earlier in the day. Eventually I recognise\
  \ a familiar looking shop and make my way back, ready to sleep on the mat on the\
  \ floor that serves as a bed. \n\nJapan is the land of contradictions - they are\
  \ futuristic with their bullet trains and their robot cafes, but fiercely traditional\
  \ with their Geishas and Sumo Wrestlers. They are bold in their habits and their\
  \ dress sense, but quiet and reserved in their character. It is one of the few places\
  \ in the world uninfluenced by American culture, visited by millions each year and\
  \ yet still remaining vastly unaffected. It\u2019s as if the Japanese have preserved\
  \ their culture, packaged it up, and are ready to serve it to you from a vending\
  \ machine - and from now on, that\u2019s the only way I\u2019ll take it."
