Text: "Rat-skewers at a border point, an elephant herd, baobab trees and an Ebola\
  \ check - I could tell we were moving up north. The road met the horizon in a haze\
  \ of heat rays and bushveld dusted in gold and copper reached the sky on either\
  \ side. The tar became sand, merging from an orange-brown to a white-grey, as the\
  \ Zambezi river ushered us in. We arrived in Lukalanya, a rural village along the\
  \ flood plains of Western Zambia.\n\nSuddenly, curious children started appearing\
  \ from their clay homes. Makuwa, Makuwa - white men. \n\nDavid Livingstone was the\
  \ first recorded missionary in West Zambia during the 1840\u2019s after traveling\
  \ north from the Cape Colony. Believed to have had good relations with the Mokololo\
  \ people, a branch of the Basotho, [who, after defeat by Shaka Zulu, also moved\
  \ to this region] was considered to have influenced Western attitudes towards African\
  \ ways of living and became known for his anti-slavery rhetoric. Fifty three years\
  \ after gaining independence from the British, armed with medical supplies and materials\
  \ to build wells, we arrived at the same piece of land. Perfectly preserved.\n\n\
  I appreciated the landscape from the roof of the 4x4, fitted with a straw sun-hat,\
  \ and a scarf around my bare shoulders. Excited children raced to the roadside waving.\
  \ I waved back. However, being born to a British father in South Africa in 1991\
  \ - just three years before the first democratic vote freed the nation from Apartheid,\
  \ and Zambia restored its multi-party democracy - the realisation of my appearance\
  \ made me cringe. \n\nOnce tents were pitched, mattresses pumped, portable generator,\
  \ fridge and gas stove plugged in, we were jokingly nicknamed The Palace by locals.\
  \ The residents welcomed us to the neighbourhood. Ensha, hande, clap, bend, repeat\
  \ - lower and lower we went in a competition of respect. We chuckled in truce, bums\
  \ centimetres from the ground.\n\nThe next morning, after my third wet-wipe-wipe-down,\
  \ I drew my eyebrows on in the moonlight and stepped out. I noticed a barefoot woman\
  \ carrying logs on her head. Across the path was a thin cloud of smoke, a simmering\
  \ pot of cassava pap balancing above the flames. Another woman collected water from\
  \ a newly installed well as the moonlight faded into a pink sky.\n\nWalking to the\
  \ next village, we passed old wells, stale with mosquito-infested water. A boy with\
  \ a deformed foot, aided by wooden crutches, ran to his homestead informing his\
  \ family that they had visitors. He asked me to read stories. Eight year old Kabele\
  \ wasn\u2019t able to go to school as it was too far for him to walk. \n\nWe strolled\
  \ past boys herding cattle in the field, while others giggled as they raced milk-carton\
  \ cars. The elderly sat chattering under shady green trees. Bra-less women in t-shirts\
  \ and wrapped skirts braided hair, weaved mats or hummed as they swept their homes\
  \ - a tranquil contentment with tradition.\n\nThat evening we sat around a crackling\
  \ wood fire under a canopy of stars. The clinic doctor told us about a boy with\
  \ a clubbed foot they\u2019d seen. They had arranged for Kabele to see a prosthetist.\n\
  \nShe also told us about a boy who came in, convulsing with his eyes rolling back.\
  \ He had untreated malaria and was taken by donkey-cart to the main road where an\
  \ ambulance would pick him up. She was unsure that he would survive. By miracle\
  \ he did.\n\nFamilies gathered to sing songs. The head chief joined the circle and\
  \ even danced. He reflected on the fact that we could all sit here together; \u201C\
  Mulimu ki yo Munde\u201D - God is good.\n\nI imagined what life might have been\
  \ like if settlers had gone about it this way instead. Perhaps they too could\u2019\
  ve sat around a fire, sharing ideas on ways of living life.\n\nIn Lukalanya it seemed\
  \ that less did offer more. Maybe this is what Livingstone was onto but died from\
  \ malaria before he could share this with The Palace, perhaps altering history."
