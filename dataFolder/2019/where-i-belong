Text: "I felt like an oversized bird standing in front of a classroom in Gulu, Uganda,\
  \ while 120 students donning blue and white uniforms stared at me. I explained that\
  \ I was splitting the class in half to debate their school\u2019s mandatory uniform\
  \ policy. I hopped from desk to desk, encouraging students to write their opinions\
  \ down which elicited embarrassed giggles, but very little writing. I spun the debate\
  \ into a competition to increase participation, promising to give one point for\
  \ an opinion and two points for a rebuttal. Insects droning in the grass outside\
  \ could be heard while the same ten students ping-ponged their ideas as 110 pairs\
  \ of eyes followed them. \n\_\nWitnessing the quiet debate, I felt the millet porridge\
  \ I had for lunch settle heavily. My summer in Gulu was inspired a few years ago\
  \ when I learned of the Lord\u2019s Resistance Army, a guerrilla group that had\
  \ terrorized the region with brutal tactics that included abducting children to\
  \ become child soldiers. My stomach churned as I realized that I was pitting students\
  \ against each other to enter a verbal fray when the aftershocks of a recent civil\
  \ war were still being felt.\n\nI had discussed the lesson earlier with my Ugandan\
  \ partner teacher, Ataro Alice, who was in her early forties with eyes that spoke\
  \ of more life experience than I could fathom. She taught English, which most of\
  \ her 7th grade students spoke, a vestige of British colonialism. She would often\
  \ say in her melodic Acholi accent, \u201CRemember that learning English is learning\
  \ how to communicate, which is the most important work we can do to excel ourselves\
  \ as well as Uganda and Africa.\u201D \n\nI initially held visions helping students\
  \ heal with the beauty of writing, but what I saw surfacing was my own ignorance.\
  \ What I saw were 7th grade students whose ages ranged from 12-22 years old because\
  \ education here was a luxury and not a given. What I saw were students carrying\
  \ a heavy burden on their still developing shoulders - trying to do the right thing,\
  \ give the correct answer, and not question the rules in place such as school uniforms\
  \ to excel not only themselves, but their country and continent too.  \n\nI wondered\
  \ if the money that I\u2019d spent to fly and spend my summer here would\u2019ve\
  \ been better spent supporting students\u2019 school fees. Ataro Alice saw the expression\
  \ on my face at the end of the day and said, \u201CDon\u2019t worry, the students\
  \ are learning, even if it doesn\u2019t seem like it. Forget about today, and I\u2019\
  ll see you later tonight.\u201D\n\nThe other American teachers and I had a Fourth\
  \ of July party planned at our compound that night. We hired a DJ and invited all\
  \ our Ugandan partner teachers to celebrate with us. Ataro Alice arrived, looking\
  \ regal in a silky blue gomesi, a traditional floor-length dress, with a creamy\
  \ white sash wrapped around her waist. \n\nWhen the DJ played a traditional Gulu\
  \ song with a steady rhythm of percussions punctuated by sharp whistles, the Ugandan\
  \ teachers cheered. They began doing the traditional Lakaraka dance which involves\
  \ pumping one\u2019s right foot and chest in perfect synchrony. Ataro Alice was\
  \ teaching me the dance which resulted in more laughter than mastery. Failing, trying,\
  \ and improving through sweaty persistence, I felt the buoyant joy of learning something\
  \ new. If I didn\u2019t care how I looked like on the dance floor, why did I care\
  \ so much about how I looked like in the classroom? \n\nThe next day, I entered\
  \ the classroom and wrote on the chalkboard, \"How can we better our school?\" \u201C\
  Today, you are all going to think of ways to make your school a better place. You\
  \ know more about this school, so please teach me.\u201D I asked them to discuss\
  \ their ideas in groups, and then Ataro Alice asked them to share. \n\n    \u201C\
  Raise money to create more scholarships.\u201D \n    \u201CHave upper grade students\
  \ tutor the lower grades.\u201D\n    \u201CDo more projects for the community!\u201D\
  \n\nUnlike yesterday, there were hands popping up everywhere while Ataro Alice facilitated\
  \ the buzzing conversation. I sat in the back unobserved, busily writing down notes\
  \ and feeling like I was right where I belonged."
