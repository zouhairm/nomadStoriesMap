Text: "Ladakh is a region in the Indian state of Jammu and Kashmir. Ladakh is renowned\
  \ for its remote mountain beauty and culture. It is a place like no other. The beauty\
  \ of the place can\u2019t be expressed in words. Visiting Leh Ladakh can be a great\
  \ experience as these places have a bounty of natural beauty. There is a bundle\
  \ of attractions in Leh Ladakh that are filled with extreme pristine beauty. Ladakh\
  \ with a unique characteristic that is a blend of Indian, Tibetan as well as Buddhism\
  \ linings make it a place which is worth paying a visit to.\nLadakh will feature\
  \ in the bucket list of every biking enthusiast in India. It is one of the finest\
  \ vacation spots in India. The highways leading to Ladakh are open only for a few\
  \ months in a year (around May-October) as they are covered in snow for the remaining\
  \ months.\nMy trip to Ladakh was not a long awaited one it was just a sudden plan.\
  \ The last day of my 4th semester exams, me and my friend suddenly planned (not\
  \ actually planned) a trip to ladakh. And Bollywood movies only added fuel to the\
  \ fire (enchanting scenes from 3 Idiots and Jab Tak Hai Jaan). So in the last week\
  \ of April, I finally got the opportunity to travel to Ladakh \u2013 a trip that\
  \ has given me memories worth a lifetime, a trip that has permanently inscribed\
  \ startling sights of this enchanting place in my mind!\nWe took a flight to Leh\
  \ and I must say that Ladakh has its own appeal. When you\u2019re about to reach\
  \ Ladakh, the very first glimpse of this snow laden heaven brings a twinkle to your\
  \ eyes! Just imagine looking down on a silent, placid, greenish blue lake \u2013\
  \ beautiful, isn\u2019t it?  Or imagine the sight of magnificent mountains greeting\
  \ you \u2013 that was a welcome I can never forget. There's nothing more enchanting\
  \ than nature's beauty in Ladakh... And then as you enter Leh, the characteristic\
  \ mountains (yes, the ones which our televisions have made very popular) greet you\
  \ with their silent white faces.\nThe days where the itinerary was covered presented\
  \ Ladakh in its true shining colors. It's a world of rugged valleys, snow-covered\
  \ mountains, endless hills, barren lands, clean and curvy roads and the mystical\
  \ Lamas where centuries old monasteries have still maintained their charm. The top\
  \ attractions of Ladakh are: \n1. Zanskar Valley \nWithout a doubt, Zanskar valley\
  \ is one of the best places to visit in Leh Ladakh. It is amongst the most deserted\
  \ places in the Himalayan range. The confluence of the Indus and the Zanskar rivers\
  \ is a rare sight. One can clearly differentiate between the two waters from a distance.\
  \ The steep terrains covered with snow reflect the heavenly skies. The tributaries\
  \ of the Zanskar River are famous for seasonal white river rafting.\n2. Pangong\
  \ Tso Lake \nRemember the breathtakingly beautiful lake from 3 Idiots where Kareena\
  \ Kapoor confessed her love? It\u2019s Pangong Tso, a lake amongst the popular tourist\
  \ attractions in Leh Ladakh, is situated on the Changtang plateau in eastern Ladakh\
  \ region. The lake offers an awesome site for camping and is the current hotspot\
  \ for all people traveling to Ladakh. Pangong Lake which undoubtedly is one of the\
  \ most peaceful (and obviously beautiful) places on this planet. Here you can stand\
  \ knowing that across the turquoise waters lie the mountains of an even more isolated\
  \  and gorgeous land \u2013 Tibet. The absolutely mesmerizing - the Pangong Lake"
