Text: "Though not the first solo, but by permission turned to be one. It all started\
  \ with a mail popping in my mail box about my click getting exhibited in Mumbai.\
  \ The leap of joy rush, and with same Adrenaline rush, I booked my tickets flew\
  \ to Mumbai. With baggages.\n\nBooked a room, shared with non. I took walks to many\
  \ places, escaped on the scenery. \n\nDay started with stroll at Marine drive though\
  \ it said to be visited at night (which I didn't missed) but day was beautiful too.\
  \ It was amazing. All people around were amazing.\n\nMoving towards Kala ghoda fest,\
  \ where my picture got exhibit, was an amazing thing to visit. The art and it's\
  \ creative minds. All were there. \n\nTowards the holy catholic Church, where I\
  \ rested for while and gate way on India and Taj, was something different to click.\n\
  \nBeing alone I was not allowed to take ferry to elephanta island. And retired home\
  \ tiring \n\nNight payed visiting to Haji ali Dargah. The peace and cold air, just\
  \ pushed my days tiredness in new freshness. Way back, the moon and city light from\
  \ Marine drive. Was something adorable to see.\n\nThe next day was fixed by a friend\
  \ whom I met. Befor he came, went to the tower clock and few nearby markets. With\
  \ him, tried local train to Bandra. Then a beach where sunset was perfectly painted.\
  \ The palladium, where traffic police were having their show. And ended up at eating\
  \ in an amazing restaurant.\n\nReturned hotel by 00:30 am.\n\nNext day was fixed.\
  \ Flight way back to home.\n\nMumbai, soon! I will return, won't let you miss me\
  \ more."
