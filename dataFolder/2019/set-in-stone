Text: "He had never seen his breath condense before. The cold air was sharp and biting\
  \ to someone who'd lived on a small tropical rock their whole life. It was as strange\
  \ and foreign as the shining marble obelisk which seemed to erupt from the frozen\
  \ earth. However, these sights paled in comparison to the building sheet of ice\
  \ encroaching over the reflecting pool, as the frigid 22 degree breeze drifted over\
  \ its waters; cutting straight to the bone. To this shivering boy from hawai'i;\
  \ the bends of the freezing Potomac were far more exotic than any warm, sandy beach.\
  \ He was as cold as he was captivated: not by the novelty of the experience but\
  \ rather the significance of his surroundings. \n\nAll around him hewn from marble,\
  \ limestone and granite were testaments to the life and work of countless individuals\
  \ for hundreds of years. And all around him they stood as resolute as the day they\
  \ were lain despite the frigid atlantic breeze. His only complaints came in memory\
  \ of the bite of each breath and hurt in his hands; for his mind was deafened by\
  \ the imaginary crashing of surf and the roar of jet engines. His eyes fixed, unseeing\
  \ upon the remaining water in the center of the reflecting pool. The tranquility\
  \ of the water allowed for the chaos of the battle to rage in his mind undisturbed.\n\
  \nThe battle was not one of blood and iron but of penchant and passion. The question\
  \ \"what do you want to do when you grow up\" left his dark complexion almost maroon\
  \ when he was unable to provide a satisfactory answer to his grandfather whom he\
  \ had met maybe a day earlier. \"Fly planes or science?\" he lied as though he had\
  \ any idea whatsoever. The reality was although he tested well, he surfed more than\
  \ he studied and he ran more than he read. He was petrified by the prospect of living\
  \ like his friends who were born and raised (and will probably die) on the same\
  \ rock of their parents and grandparents. Like history, where you come from is set\
  \ in stone but like the future, where you go is up to you."
