Text: "India, as diverse it is in culture, the landscape here is also varying. Lying\
  \ in The northern mountains, is a cold Deserted valley named Spiti Valley. It is\
  \ situated in the district of Lahaul and Spiti at a height of 4270 meters. The journey\
  \ to the valley is also one heck of an adventure specially the Manali - Spiti route.\n\
  The valley is blessed with the beauty and Nature. It is a cold desert in summer\
  \ and in winter it gets covered in thick snow. Having a population of 33 thousand\
  \ approx. Lahaul and Spiti is one of the least populated district in India. \nAs\
  \ mesmerizing is the nature there, the people of spiti also have beautiful hearts.\
  \ Always ready to help the tourists, locals make sure you are having a good time.\n\
  Locals never mind giving a ride and will even invite you for a tea. The smile on\
  \ their faces, even after living at a place with so basic facilities and harsh weather\
  \ makes you smile as well. They might not be rich or under the best conditions,\
  \ but still they seem happy. \nThe only thing they didn't liked, which one of the\
  \ locals told me about was the increase in number of hotels here. They believe it\
  \ is taking away the local culture. It was also the reason they have to face water\
  \ shortage. He told they are not against tourists or don't want them to come. Tourism\
  \ is what gets them money and jobs. They fell that it would be better if tourists\
  \ asked them for a room, and anyone who can help will help. There is no need of\
  \ so many Hostels.\nI was also surprised to know that there no doors in any of the\
  \ villages like around till 60 years ago. But since it started becoming a tourist\
  \ destination, the had to install doors.\nThis trip has really helped me to grow\
  \ and made me realize that to be happy one doesn't needs a lot like the people of\
  \ Spiti. Also it showed me how tourism can affect the local culture and lifestyle.\
  \ So, lets all try to get as local as possible while travelling, after all Traveling\
  \ is not only about seeing places its also about experiencing the local culture.\n\
  \nHappy Traveling.."
