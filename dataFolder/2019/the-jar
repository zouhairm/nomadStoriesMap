Text: "The jar\nMartina Vianovi\n\n\n\u201COver there! A tree!\u201D\nWe are driving\
  \ through the red land of Morocco. Nothing but dusty soil as far as the eye can\
  \ see, for days. We\u2019ve visited Fez, Rabat, Casablanca, then Marrakesh, Agadir,\
  \ Ourzazate. We had tajine, we bathed into the ocean, listened to the muezzin at\
  \ dawn, and woke up on the hostel\u2019s roof - too hot to sleep inside. It\u2019\
  s August, and we\u2019re now wandering inland, moving towards the desert.\n\u201C\
  A tree, a tree!\u201D\nCelebrations from the back seat. It\u2019s not a hallucination:\
  \ a huge tree is standing there, right in front of us, in the middle of nowhere.\
  \ Next to it, a tiny hovel, which looks like an abandoned stable. No roof, half\
  \ a door, a hole where the window should be.\nWe decide to stop the car to enjoy\
  \ the large, unexpected shadow of the tree. We get out of the car and stretch. We\
  \ sit in circle, yawning in the orange afternoon light. The heat slides into our\
  \ lungs as we breathe and laugh. Our eyes are burning behind our sunglasses.\nAll\
  \ around, silence.\nFrom the hovel, the head of a man slowly appears. He stares\
  \ at us, leaning to the jamb. He is going to tell us to leave, we think, we\u2019\
  re sitting on his land. Maybe he\u2019s going to yell, even shoot. We don\u2019\
  t know who he is, and he does not know who we are either. He stands there for a\
  \ while though, saying nothing, then disappears inside. Another bullet dodged.\n\
  We pull out our sandwiches from the backpacks, and start eating. But then he appears\
  \ again. Crooked and slow, he comes out of the hovel and gets closer. We start feeling\
  \ a bit anxious. He stands there now, next to us. His big trembling hands are holding\
  \ something we can\u2019t see. He leans forward, and drops the object to the ground.\
  \ He smiles.\nWe don\u2019t realize it, at first. Then we can\u2019t believe our\
  \ eyes: a jam jar used as a glass and filled with hot Moroccan tea.\nWe are incredulous.\
  \ We look at the jar, we look at him. We smile back. When we try to invite him to\
  \ stay and drink with us, he\u2019s already turning around, shaking his head. Tea\
  \ is for you, not for me, his gesture seems to say. Then, he waves in the sun before\
  \ vanishing into the hovel for good.\n\nShortly after, we get again into the car\
  \ leaving behind us the empty jar and all we had from the last suq we got lost into:\
  \ cheese, some bread, a tiny cake.\nNot enough but still, all we had."
