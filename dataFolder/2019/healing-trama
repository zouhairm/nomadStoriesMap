Text: "My dream was to go to Ireland and heal. I work with women and children leaving\
  \ domestic violence. I also work with people effected by substance and mental health\
  \ disorders. I worked three jobs for a year to do this. One morning I was  running\
  \ to get on a bus from Galway to Kilkenny. As I was getting on the bus it hit me.\
  \ I most  have brand a gallon of water. I mean I had to go to the bathroom bad.\
  \ This is a four hour buss ride. One lady on the buss was arguing with her boyfriend\
  \ beating he used all the drugs with out her. The entire time yelling at him. We\
  \ finally make it to Kilkenny. I took one step off the bus and it didn\u2019t even\
  \ hit the ground when a man running down the street ran me over. I found myself\
  \ on the ground. The bus driver yelling at the man who didn\u2019t stop. Al of a\
  \ sudden I released I had pissed myself. laying on the ground covered in my own\
  \ fluids. I couldn\u2019t help but start laughing.The buss driver looking at me\
  \ like I was crazy. Helped me up. Gave me my bag. I realized in that moment how\
  \ lucky I was and living your dreams are completely possible. My hostel was just\
  \ a block up the road. Please pick me for this trip it\u2019s actually my next dream\
  \ destination."
