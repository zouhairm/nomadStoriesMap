Text: "Sitting directly beside the framed louvres in my room trying to mirror the\
  \ conflicting feeling of fear and joy roaming on the streets of my mind as I view\
  \ the just-granted visa to visit Egypt for the first time. Cleaned my picnic shoes\
  \ off its past dusty experiences in readiness for the next climb on the sandy dunes\
  \ of Egyptian plains leading the route to the great pyramids, filled with different\
  \ footprints representing conflicting memories and experiences of previous wanderers\
  \ seeking redemption from their hurting past. This was my first time leaving the\
  \ country I once called home on a quest to knock off the first item on my bucket\
  \ list. \nI\u2019ve been a sucker for living in the past, engaging with the objects\
  \ of their archaic technologies and culture, and that was why I opted for a land\
  \ with well documented history, beautiful landscapes, defining memories as the land\
  \ of Egypt. I wanted to have a first-hand experience of the people, the land and\
  \ their culture, as the nation holds the key to the missives sent from the ancient\
  \ past in the form of huge structures, giving sight to their belief system and their\
  \ mental strength.\nI arrived in Cairo, the Capital of Egypt that had just survived\
  \ a revolutionary crises that ended the 30 years rule of President Mubarak. For\
  \ safety purposes, my tour guide advised I stayed in the urban area of the city\
  \ which I later conflicted, for it might deprive me of full interaction with the\
  \ feelings of the land and concerns of the people, thus I disagreed and opted for\
  \ the noisy suburbs, filled with rhythms and energy emanating from the sound of\
  \ the ney and oud whilst the people danced in circles despite the ravaging fear\
  \ hovering around \u2013 fear of losing another family to the crisis, fear of another\
  \ looming crisis \u2013 but all these fears bows in the present as we enjoyed the\
  \ evening.\nWith a prepared heart but a weak body still suffering from the backlog\
  \ of the fun of the previous day, we set course towards the plains covering the\
  \ enormous beauty that attracts people with their peculiar backgrounds, nations,\
  \ beliefs and drive. Different people visits the pyramids for different reasons.\
  \ One of my fellow tourist named Mashallah described how she believed visiting the\
  \ wonder is a way to cleanse the soul, in preparation for her final salvation. Though\
  \ I never believed her views, I was indeed enthralled with the passion and thrust\
  \ at which she delivered her views. Another sojourner, Reeves, a travel photographer,\
  \ embarked this trip trying to capture the unseen emotions of the ancient builders,\
  \ their unspoken works as they placed a boulder over another. Marc, on the other\
  \ hand was there just for the views, spanning through the land like an unmanned\
  \ lighthouse, looking over neighboring pyramids Khafre and Menkaure in search of\
  \ the love he lost to the hands of death few years ago. In all my interactions as\
  \ we harmoniously climbed the pyramid stones one after another, I could arguably\
  \ confirm that people visit historical sites for different reasons and purpose.\
  \ Some visit to find some sort of solace, some sort of solitude and connection with\
  \ their past, envisioning what prompted them to make silly and uneventful decisions\
  \ and seeking ways to strip themselves of the hurt. They all believed visiting historical\
  \ sites and cultures could be the cure they\u2019d ever needed. \nSome others just\
  \ like me, needed that break from the chaos of the present world, an escape from\
  \ the everyday life that is lived in a loop, always wishing for the loop to stop.\
  \ We wanted to experience the way of ancient lives were lived, in order to draw\
  \ out a sustainable plan, fit for living in this current dispensation amidst the\
  \ hurdles.\nMaybe the key to the future lies in the remains of the past, or maybe\
  \ they don\u2019t, but I have high hopes that one who is a student of the past never\
  \ makes the documented mistakes that leads to destruction."
