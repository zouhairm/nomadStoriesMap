Text: "The Gateway\n\tKo \u0305rudo: cold. Despite the warmth of the afternoon, the\
  \ water was freezing, and we looked at each other sidelong, second-guessing ourselves.\
  \ \n\tWe were standing on stone steps down to Lake Biwa, a basin of clear\u2014\
  cold\u2014aqua water stretching out towards mountains in the distance. It was broken\
  \ only by recreationalists and a gateway: a tall tiger-orange and black Shinto shrine.\
  \ A torii gate. Each is believed to mark the entrance from the mundane to the heightened\
  \ or the sacred. \n\t\u201CThink it\u2019s holy?\u201D I murmured, thumbing a streak\
  \ of sunscreen along my chin. We had swimsuits under our hiking clothes, and I wanted\
  \ nothing more than to take a dip after yesterday\u2019s trek. \nNot that that was\
  \ our only goal. A quick swim to the shrine and back meant pictures underneath the\
  \ gateway, a story, and a badge of honor for doing something crazy. At least until\
  \ we could one-up it next time. \nHe turned around, looking for someone to ask.\
  \ \u201CHow good\u2019s your Japanese?\u201D he grinned at me, knowing the answer.\n\
  \u201CSumimasen, \u2018holy\u2019 nodesu ka?\u201D Despite my sarcasm, I could probably\
  \ bridge the language barrier. \n\u201CThere\u2019s jet skiers. How holy could it\
  \ be?\u201D He was right. There were jet skis and paddleboards and kayaks, all drifting\
  \ around the shrine for that million-dollar shot. The only difference was they were\
  \ all natives. \nCold\u2014we could deal. Holy\u2014not a problem. Being foreign\u2014\
  probably what would do us in. \nIt wouldn\u2019t have been such a problem if we\
  \ weren\u2019t surrounded by Japanese sightseers. The steps behind us swarmed with\
  \ casual native tourists enjoying their afternoon. And they were about to see a\
  \ lot of exotic pale white skin. \nWe walked back to our packs stashed off to the\
  \ side of the stone steps. We didn\u2019t say anything but looked to each other\
  \ for reassurance. \nWould we really back down from our own challenge? The question\
  \ taunted me. I never backed down from anything. Not eating octopus, not a five-hour\
  \ hike, not taking a job in Japan. \n\u201CI\u2019ll do it if you do it,\u201D I\
  \ said softly. I could see the shrine in his eyes as he watched the waters behind\
  \ me, his nose wrinkling under his freckles. \u201CAre we about to be crazy gaijin?\u201D\
  \ he asked, taking back the word they whispered behind us. \n\u201CAfter the three-hour\
  \ train ride to get here, if we don\u2019t get in we\u2019ll be crazy gaijin.\u201D\
  \ His eyes dropped to my face, and he smiled. Together, we pulled the towels we\u2019\
  d bought from the kombini from our packs. Then we faced one another, and my eyes\
  \ followed his hands to his shirt hem.\n\u201CThree. Two.\u201D We stripped down\
  \ faster than the Shinkansen, ignoring the gasps behind us. I couldn\u2019t have\
  \ picked a more obnoxious yellow bathing suit if I\u2019d tried. \nBut the sound\
  \ of shock turned to cheers. We were suddenly getting claps and catcalls.\nSlowly,\
  \ we turned to acknowledge the crowd. Cries of kawaii and ko \u0305rudo met us,\
  \ simultaneously telling us we were cute and crazy. We were cute and crazy\u2026\
  and not in trouble. \n\u201CDomo,\u201D I bowed repeatedly, self-conscious and apologetic.\
  \ My shirtless travel partner followed suit, nervous laughter trickling from his\
  \ lips. Our awkward thanks sounded like questions; any moment they\u2019d kick us\
  \ out of the country.\nI looked at him, two wolf-whistles away from throwing back\
  \ on my clothes and running to the train station. Our eyes met, incredulous, our\
  \ stomachs full of butterflies, and I took a shaky breath. If we didn\u2019t do\
  \ it now, we\u2019d talk ourselves out of it.  \nThe gateway stood on the water\
  \ awaiting us: the mundane to the heightened.\nReady.\nWe looked to each other for\
  \ courage\u2014\n\u2014wondered what about adventures made us do crazy things\u2014\
  \n\u2014scampered to the water\u2019s edge\u2014\n\u2014and jumped."
