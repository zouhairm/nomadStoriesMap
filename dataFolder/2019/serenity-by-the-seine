Text: "Paris.  The city of lovers.  The ideal, if somewhat clich\xE9d, choice to finish\
  \ off a European honeymoon.  \n\nI had it all planned:  visiting Notre Dame to experience\
  \ a Gregorian Mass; checking out the treasures of the Louvre on a guided tour; scaling\
  \ the wrought-iron heights of the Eiffel tower with the City of Lights glittering\
  \ beneath our feet; and a nighttime stroll through the atmospheric chaos of Latin\
  \ Quarter, before retiring to our quaint hotel in a 17th century building.  It was\
  \ going to be perfect.  But you know what Robert Burns wrote about the best laid\
  \ plans ...\n\nI should probably backtrack.  My wife and I got married in 2016 and,\
  \ after saving for a couple of years, I decided to plan a trip to Italy for our\
  \ honeymoon.  It was to be the cultural and romantic experience of a lifetime, a\
  \ sort of mini-Grand Tour with only two weeks and a limited amount of funds to make\
  \ it happen.  I was determined to maximize our aesthetic, culinary and spiritual\
  \ opportunities as much as possible.\n\nWe were awestruck by the Duomo in Milan.\
  \  We fell in love with the beauty of Lake Como, and stoked our artistic fires by\
  \ visiting the Uffizi and Accademia galleries in Florence.  We participated in a\
  \ cooking class in the Tuscan countryside, and later did a walking food tour in\
  \ Naples.  We saw the Vatican and experienced the incredible beauty and unalloyed\
  \ chaos of the Sistine Chapel.  We indulged our love for the classics in Rome, visiting\
  \ the Colosseum, Nero\u2019s Domus Aurea, and the Pantheon, and topped it all off\
  \ with a side quest to Pompeii.  By the time we got to Venice we were getting pretty\
  \ tired, but still found time to visit the Doge\u2019s Palace, La Fenice, and St.\
  \ Mark\u2019s Basilica, and also take a trip to the outlying islands.\n\nThen it\
  \ was on to Paris, for one last event-filled day before heading back home \u2013\
  \ and that is when the proverbial merde hit the fan.  Anything that could go wrong\
  \ did.  \n\nMy wife got violently ill the night before we were to leave.  I accidentally\
  \ deleted one of our plane tickets on my phone.  By the time the plane touched down\
  \ in Paris at 10 am, my wife was sick, I was stressed, and all either of us wanted\
  \ to do was sleep.  \n\nHungry, tired and completely spent from our trip, we wandered\
  \ listlessly through Shakespeare & Company, an independent bookshop just around\
  \ the corner from our hotel.  At the adjoining caf\xE9, with the help of hot tea\
  \ and fresh Parisian scones, we started to relax.  We couldn\u2019t loiter all day,\
  \ however, and made our way across the street to Ren\xE9 Viviani Square, named after\
  \ the man who was Prime Minister of France when World War I broke out.  It is a\
  \ small, well-maintained public park, with a few benches, an interesting fountain\
  \ which is only accessible by walking under floral arches, and what I later discovered\
  \ is the oldest tree in Paris.  We found a bench and, appetites satiated for the\
  \ moment, sat down to rest.  It was a matter of minutes before my wife fell asleep\
  \ with her head on my shoulder.\n\nThe chimes of Notre Dame Cathedral, just across\
  \ the Seine, struck twelve.  And that\u2019s when the thought struck me.  There\
  \ I was on a crisp, early autumn day, sitting in a park in Paris with my beloved.\
  \  The sun was shining, the wind was lightly blowing, birds were chirping, the glorious\
  \ bells of Notre Dame were pealing, and for one brief moment, all was right with\
  \ the world.\n\nAfter leaving the park we mustered enough energy to see the highlights\
  \ of the Louvre, then came back and had dinner at a local restaurant in the Quarter.\
  \  We were exhausted.  We never did get to see the Eiffel Tower up close, and that\u2019\
  s just fine by me.  After all the experiences that we had, all the planning and\
  \ the running about, the moment I keep coming back to is that hour of serenity in\
  \ a small park by the Seine with my soulmate at my side.  Doing nothing, saying\
  \ nothing, and feeling completely fulfilled."
