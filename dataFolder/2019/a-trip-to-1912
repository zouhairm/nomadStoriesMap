Text: "It was a Friday morning, I was 28 years old, and my base camp was located in\
  \ Palma de Mallorca. I left the hostel without breakfast because I had bought a\
  \ train ticket to go to Soller, and it left at 8:40 am.\n\nI had not prepared the\
  \ day's itinerary, I didn\u2019tt know where I was going to go, all I knew was that\
  \ the train I was going to take was dated 1912, and it was exciting!\n\nI arrived\
  \ at the station and that train covered with wood was waiting for me. It was filled\
  \ with families, couples, mostly foreigners, and there I was, traveling to the past.\n\
  \nOnly vegetation was contemplated and peace was breathed by the train. It was slow,\
  \ but arrived at its destination, and that's where my amazements began.\n\nI arrived\
  \ at Soller, a rustic, stone village, which made you feel that you were at the beginning\
  \ of the 20th century. I went through the town and bought some local product.\n\n\
  I wanted to go to Port Soller, and I decided to take a tram that and what a great\
  \ choice! A magical and beautiful journey to the port, a walk that I would recommend\
  \ to the most reluctant.\n\nIt was close to lunch time, so after a short walk I\
  \ sat on the terrace of the restaurant Sa Barca. I looked at the letter, and I dared\
  \ to order a salad, a plate of mussels and a good wine. At the next table there\
  \ was a couple who looked at me with astonished face. What's that young girl doing\
  \ alone eating some mussels and a white wine? They told the waiter and laughed.\
  \ When I heard them I also laughed: \"the pleasure of traveling alone\". For dessert\
  \ I asked the waiter for a shot of some liquor to celebrate my delicious lunch.\
  \ He gave me to try an own liquor of the island called \"El Tunel\", I liked it\
  \ so much, and he gave me the label of the bottle, which I still have.\n\nIt was\
  \ already 4pm, I thought about going back. I took a bus to Palma de Mallorca, it\
  \ was running thought the coast, and halfway it made a stop at Deia, and on impulse\
  \ I decided to get off. What a beautiful town! It was a town built on the side of\
  \ a mountain, many slopes, but what a magical one!\n\nThey told me there was a cove,\
  \ I decided to go for a swim. You would arrive after half an hour of walking, you\
  \ had to cross a field, and I got lost. I didn\u2019t know how to go back or continue,\
  \ but luckily I found two lost Germans like me, and together we managed to reach\
  \ the sea.\n\nIt was a cove covered with stones, but beautiful, with transparent\
  \ waters, fishes, few bathers, and a rustic bar that made me think \"who goes down\
  \ every day on that hillside to run this bar in the middle of nowhere?\". Whatever\
  \ it was, that place was like being in a spa.\n\nWhen I came back, I walked with\
  \ a couple of English people. They told me that every summer they came to Deia,\
  \ they were in love with the place.\n\nI was going to take the bus and finish my\
  \ route, but before I had a lemonade in a bar that was a few meters from the bus\
  \ stop. All the juices were made with the own fruit of the owner's garden, with\
  \ which I could talk a little.\n\nI got on the bus to back. I was exhausted, but\
  \ deeply relaxed. From the window I could see a bit of Valdemossa, a town that I\
  \ signed up to visit on a next occasion.\n\nI arrived in Palma de Mallorca, I dined,\
  \ I got into bed, and I could only draw a huge smile on my face and thank the air.\
  \ Now I knew how the actresses felt in the 60s traveling on the island, but I didn\u2019\
  t have a convertible car, or a handkerchief to cover my hair."
