Text: "I didn\u2019t know what I\u2019m expecting to find the day I step on my feet\
  \ in the land of Papua, Indonesia.\n\nI just knew it must be something that will\
  \ beat all the beauty of nature and culture compared to what I\u2019ve seen in my\
  \ whole life.\nunfortunately I\u2019m not travelling that often, so my expectation\
  \ was pretty much less.\n\nPapua is the easternmost island of Indonesia, bordered\
  \ by land with the Papua New Guinea country,\nI myself call It the island of bird,\
  \  it\u2019s not because it has so many birds  although it probably do , I\u2019\
  m not an expert or knowledgeable about birds of Papua, Get a map and take a look,\
  \ it just because the island looks like a bird to me, with its head, beak and  body.\n\
  \nPapua have been tickled my mind since a very long time ago, an enchanting mystery\
  \ for me where I have never seen nor imagine before, I only heard the story about\
  \ how pristine ,diverse and rich with panoramic and culture this place is.\n\nSo\
  \ there I was, on my way to the biggest city on Papua island, Jayapura, on a plane,\
  \  through the window feeling amazing to see a stunning landscape as I watch the\
  \ runway  in the edge of the bluish Sentani lake, surrounded by lush green cyclops\
  \ mountains. \n\nFrom the outskirt of the city,using the taxi available at the airport,\
  \ I\u2019m heading to the heart of Jayapura city and leaving the highland lake area\
  \ behind, All along the way, where the sky is blue, traditional homes looks so tranquil\
  \ all along the lake, , trees that looks older than my grandfather covered with\
  \ vines with roots hanging and tangling, gives me a vibe of semi  jungle-ish view\
  \ on the side of the road like I\u2019ve never seen before, this made this city\
  \ feels different, \n\nMore than an hour later I arrive in the downtown. It\u2019\
  s still morning anyway, nearly brunch time and I have enough sleep from 8 hours\
  \ night flight from Jakarta. I dropped my luggage in the hotel room and heading\
  \ fast to find local traditional food with the help of my kind driver that I rent\
  \ for that day. \nThis is the same taxi driver that took me from the airport to\
  \ the city, I was able to negotiate to rent him and his car for that day with some\
  \ price that he offered, mind you it takes some amount of money but it still affordable.\n\
  \nMy driver takes me to a small shop to have papeda. Papeda is the common staple\
  \ food for native local for papuans and moluccans  in Indonesia. It is made from\
  \ sago starch, It has glue-like texture with clear color, sticky, gooey and chewy,\
  \ and pretty much tasteless for my taste but very fulfilling. Served with delicious\
  \ yellow soup,lime,fish and dabu dabu ( typical local condiment contains from chopped\
  \ red chili pepper, shallots,  bird eye chili, tomatoes), instead of varieties of\
  \ local food that we can find in this city , there are always western or Chinese\
  \ food for those who don\u2019t really keen on trying local delicacies.\n\nJayapura\
  \ is a bay city, surrounded by hills packed with untouched trees. Some people build\
  \ their houses on the hills among the lush green trees  with bright colorful paint,\
  \ the ethnicity of the local people is quite diverse,beautiful Beaches are easily\
  \ found within a couple of minutes using cars or motorcycle, very much in the inner\
  \ city. I won\u2019t forget how amazing I felt the moment when I saw many flocks\
  \ of bird fly above my head, so near and so free from the forest and hills  heads\
  \ to the open sea.\n\nThis City is alive during days and night especially on hang\
  \ out places around mall and shopping center, I'll be more than happy to have a\
  \ sips of local coffee in many cafes on the beachfront , then up on the hill away\
  \ from the beach and seashore, watching the horizon,  where stunning view of the\
  \ ocean  blew my mind when I finally reach there.\n\nI knew I expect less before\
  \ I got here, but it is when you expect less you are getting more than you thought\
  \ you might have."
