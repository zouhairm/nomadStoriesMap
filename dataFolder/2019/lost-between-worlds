Text: "I try to decipher the meaning behind each small ritual, from the burning of\
  \ cedar leaves to the inhaling of liquid tobacco. Their significance is lost on\
  \ me, a gringa. As the shaman finishes his prayers, he offers a cup of purple-red\
  \ liquid to the flames; the fire always drinks first. Known as the Vine of Souls,\
  \ ayahuasca is said to allow its vessel to commune with the spirit world.\n\nThis\
  \ right was once reserved for the medicine men and women of the Americas, yet mostly\
  \ white faces formed a circle around the ceremonial fire. Today, people cross oceans\
  \ to imbibe this unpalatable mixture for its insights and the promise of often painful\
  \ transformation. There were many reasons to be anxious. I was searching for answers\
  \ of my own, but if ayahuasca had a language, it was an ancient tongue I didn\u2019\
  t speak. \n\nThe brew seemed to come in waves.  When I was sure the medicine\u2019\
  s intoxication had passed, another rush of the vine surged through me and back into\
  \ the void I slipped. I awoke alone in a twilit desert. Unlike the kaleidoscopic\
  \ patterns and disjointed impressions that accompanied its earlier peaks, this vision\
  \ seemed clear and real. It is perfectly still here. An infinite expanse of barren\
  \ earth meets with the horizon in all directions, cliff faces forming silhouettes\
  \ in the distance. Although it appears lifeless, creatures hide in plain sight and\
  \ in the shadows \u2013 the desert abounds in life unseen. Caution led me to believe\
  \ that the darkness and open plains left me vulnerable to becoming prey, still I\
  \ felt safe. This is where the coyotes roam.  \n\nAmorphous red blurs began to take\
  \ form beside me. What a beautiful fox. 'No\u2013' a voice proclaimed 'that is a\
  \ coyote', as it materialised into the beast. We\u2019ve never met, but I sensed\
  \ that we have known each other for lifetimes. Like long-lost kin picking up where\
  \ we left off, we shared our stories and laughed at our misfortunes while entire\
  \ seasons came and went. Coyote is a fun, mischievous shapeshifter and captivating\
  \ story teller. His playful antics never cease to make me smile. Feeling completely\
  \ free in his company, I breathe a sigh of content and savour the time we have left\
  \ together. He breaks the silence and invites me to go into the desert with him.\
  \ \u2018We\u2019ll have some peyote!\u2019\n\nI\u2019ve heard of peyote in passing,\
  \ I only know that it is another \u2018teacher\u2019 plant. While I was honoured\
  \ by the sentiment, I convinced myself I could not stray any further. \u2018It'll\
  \ really take the edge off\u2019 he teased, overlooking my ignorance. Coyote was\
  \ clever and did not wait for me to contemplate a second time. Gently but swiftly,\
  \ an undeniable shift occurred. These were not the alien scapes of the aya-verse\
  \ I had grown accustomed to. New sensations washed over my consciousness, leaving\
  \ my body feeling lighter than air. Time slowed as the desert became an intimate,\
  \ ethereal realm where even the stones radiated their own colourful essence and\
  \ impossible beauty. I stood in awe. The coyote had shown me his home \u2013 our\
  \ home. \n\nAs the ceremony came to a close on this human plane, I could hardly\
  \ contain the tale inside of me. Still, I waited for a chance to speak with the\
  \ now exhausted shaman. True to animistic tradition, he explained that these plants\
  \ are especially powerful and intelligent. Although we had not consumed peyote,\
  \ its spirit had intervened in my journey. He referred to this 'a calling'.\n\n\
  My sober, rational mind would have tried to place a firm line between fantasy and\
  \ reality, but I no longer needed to dissect my experience, from a Western lens\
  \ or otherwise. I came here asking for why\u2019s and how\u2019s. I looked for reason\
  \ behind my daily struggles and solutions to my perceived afflictions. Instead I\
  \ was taught to accept all moments as they are. Walking only briefly beyond the\
  \ veil to explore worlds stranger than fiction, I found that it\u2019s ok not to\
  \ have all the answers. I only hope that someday coyote and I will meet again."
