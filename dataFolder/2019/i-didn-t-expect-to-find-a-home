Text: "The red sand, the low dry trees, the bright sun, the warm evening breeze. Those\
  \ were my expectations of the Gambia. When I fist arrived I remember seeing some\
  \ older men sitting under a baobab tree for shade, playing cards and laughing hard.\
  \ I did not know at the time that this impression would stay in my mind forever\
  \ as a symbol of appreciating the small things in life. Little did I expect that\
  \ coming back to the airport a week later would feel like leaving a new found home.\
  \ After walking in the red sand that I had dreamt about for SO long and enjoying\
  \ meeting SO many people everyday, I felt my cheeks hurt and came to the conclusion\
  \ that \u201Dthe smiling coast\u201D have had a deep and profound effect on me.\
  \ Early on I met a young man named Abdul who I talked to everyday, about life, the\
  \ meaning of it all, work, family and democracy - or the lack of it. I thought to\
  \ myself even before leaving that I would miss him and our late night conversations\
  \ deeply, and I still do. Traveling from a priviligied country to a country that\
  \ just implied true democracy makes you see things very clearly. If your basic needs\
  \ are not met, like enough food or money to pay rent, then all you have are the\
  \ things in life for free. It is free to smile, free to dance on the steet everytime\
  \ you hear a great tune, free to converse with every stranger you meet and find\
  \ interesting, free to take a walk, free to talk, free to have a great time no matter\
  \ where you are.  It really does puts things in perspective. I felt a bit sad realising\
  \ that in Sweden or maybe the whole of Europe, we lost track of these simple things\
  \ in life, due to our conctant battle trying to succeed and improve. In our battle\
  \ to own more expensive things,  we work hard, we want SOMETHING(?), we are chasing\
  \ some kind of approval  from everyone around us and sadly MOSTLY -  ourselves.\
  \ We've simply lost track. Being in a country where stability is not taken for granted\
  \ everyday matters, this was clear to me when I went to Kunta Kinteh (described\
  \ in Alex Haleys \u201DRoots\u201D) Island \u2013 an important historical site in\
  \ the West African slave trade. I travelled by ferry and from Juffareh with a Jeep\
  \ that was hardly working, with a guide called Yusuf and thought it was awful to\
  \ see and take in what had happened in Kunta Kinteh Island not too long ago. I asked\
  \ Yusuf how he felt about it and was surprised by his answer \u2013 \u201DI never\
  \ think about it, its not you, its not me, i am happy now, its got notehing to do\
  \ with us\u201D. This statement was reacurring with most people I talked  to \u2013\
  \ this presence in life seemed to be, maybe not a cultural thing, but a state of\
  \ mind coming from living in such a place as the Gambia \u2013 where nothing is\
  \ taken for granted. This is what I am taking home with me and why I cant wait to\
  \ come back with more important life lessons such as this."
