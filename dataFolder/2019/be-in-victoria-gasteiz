Text: "In a roughly one hour drive or two-hour train from Bilbao, you can be in Victoria-Gasteiz,\
  \ which makes Victoria-Gasteiz a perfect day trip from Bilbao or Getxo. It is also\
  \ possible to see all the sights of the historic part of the city in one day. I\
  \ didn't because I wanted a reason to come back and a few rain showers. Victoria-Gasteiz\
  \ is the capital of Basque Country and in the state of \xC1lava, Spain. At the foot\
  \ of the Pyrenees Mountains, the geographical border of Spain and France, Victoria-Gasteiz\
  \ developed into a significant trading city during the medieval times because many\
  \ traders stopped here while crossing the border.  Hence, many of the streets in\
  \ the historic area are named after different trades. For example, some of the roads\
  \ are Kalle Zapater\xEDa, Pintorer\xEDa, and Cuchiller\xEDa. Another nice thing\
  \ about the city is how easy it is to navigate due to it being an oval.\n\nIf you\
  \ take the train into Victoria-Gasteiz, the entrance of the old town is a straight\
  \ five block walk. Take Eduardo Dato street if you want a direct route to the visitors\
  \ center and Plaza de Espa\xF1a. Here you can get a map of the city and start exploring.\
  \ For the more adventurous soul, take San Antonio street and be greeted with Plaza\
  \ de la Virgen Blanca. From here you can start exploring on your own.  Victoria-Gasteiz\
  \ is also a passing city on one of the routes of the Camino de Santiago.\n\nOnce\
  \ I found my way to the Plaza de la Virgen Blanca, I became fascinated with taking\
  \ photos of this statue near Iglesia de San Miguel. This one was my favorite, despite\
  \ it having little flaws to the picture. It had just stopped raining, and the sun\
  \ began to creep out again.\n\nAfter walking around without a particular agenda\
  \ for the day, I began to search for the best place to eat. I first went to the\
  \ tourist center where I asked what streets might offer the best \"Menu del D\xED\
  a.\" A typical way of eating here in Spain. The Menu del D\xEDa is a fixed price\
  \ meal with three courses, wine, and bread. Each round will also have three or four\
  \ different options, and the last dish is a desert. The lady at the tourist center\
  \ recommended four different streets I could find something to eat. After checking\
  \ out all four lanes, I decided to go to a place called Maria la Gorda. I highly\
  \ recommend this place if you find yourself passing through Victoria-Gasteiz. Funny\
  \ enough, it is located just past Kalle San Francisco on Pintorer\xEDa. \n\nAfter\
  \ walking around for a few hours, I was starving. I needed carbs to make it through\
  \ the rest of the day. I was so hungry I forgot to take a picture of my monster\
  \ piece of lasagna that I order for my first course. Or maybe I was just busy drinking\
  \ wine and finally eating. The lasagna was fantastic and came with a spicy red aioli\
  \ to top it off. Yes, it was a blogging fail.\n\nFor my second course, I ordered\
  \ steak and french fries.  Accompanying the French fries were traditional Basque\
  \ sweet red Espelette peppers. Additionally, there was another hot green aioli to\
  \ dip the steak or chips on the side. \n\nFor dessert, I order my favorite dish\
  \ here in Spain, Arroz con Leche. In the middle of the bowl, there was also a small\
  \ scope of ice cream, and cinnamon sprinkled around it. Everything was delicious,\
  \ and I asked to take a photo of my server and the cook for the blog.\n\nAfter eating,\
  \ I wanted to find  Catedral de Santa Maria. Unfortunately, it is currently under\
  \ construction and it this point of the day mostly everything was closed for the\
  \ lunch hours. I also had to return at 6 p.m to meet with Carmen. So going inside\
  \ anything was out of the question. So I started wondering again. Luckily, there\
  \ is still a lot to see. Near the cathedral are the two murals, \"El Triunfo de\
  \ Vitoria\" and  Al Hilo del Tiempo."
