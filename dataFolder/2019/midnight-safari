Text: "It's about 11pm when I'm accosted by a tsunami of bomber-jacket wearing Uber\
  \ men, bellowing, \u201CTaxi!\u201D at me as I exit Jos\xE9 Mar\xEDa C\xF3rdova\
  \ airport, Colombia, on my way to the city of Medellin. Somehow, I slip by intact\
  \ and make for the official rank, where I think I'll be better off...\n\nThe foremost\
  \ driver grabs my luggage, scraping it over the edge of his tiny pastel-yellow boot.\
  \ Three buttons unfastened on his shirt are exactly enough to reveal a gold chain\
  \ and crucifix nested in his ample chest hair. He pumps my hand with Trump-like\
  \ vigour. A powerful waft of aftershave narrows my eyes. He seems confused, though,\
  \ when I share my hotel address with him, not remedied by either of us being able\
  \ to speak the other's language. I jump in regardless. \n\nIt's about 35 minutes\
  \ to my destination, says Luis (per his dash-badge), and 75,000 Pesos, I decipher.\
  \ Despite the specifics, I'm a little nervous. I tuck my hands under my thighs -\
  \ I don't know why - there's no seatbelts to steady me, much less keep me safe.\
  \ \n\nLuis impetuously whips his micro-cab around the traffic, shooting for some\
  \ kind of \u201CPB\u201D it seems. We climb towards the high mountain regions surrounding\
  \ Medellin, which has the moniker, \"La Ciudad de la Eterna Primavera\", the \u201C\
  City of the Eternal Spring\u201D due to its comfortable year-round climate \u2013\
  \ it's one of the reasons I decided to come. \n\nThe rising steepness presses me\
  \ back into my seat as we coil upward with a deep forest to our right, drop-offs\
  \ steadily getting droppier. I push my hands deeper under my thighs. Suddenly, the\
  \ green curtain falls away to reveal a magnificent clear view of Medellin, which,\
  \ for a moment, looks like it's had a giant pot of glitter spilled upon it, as midnight\
  \ lights glint and glow deep into the valley. Luis says the city has 3 million people,\
  \ in Spanish. I say, \u201CI didn't know it was that big\u201D, to myself. \u201C\
  And Bogota?\u201D, I ask with a curious hyper-inflexion. 8 million. The bonding\
  \ brings a smile.\n\n30 minutes in, I attempt to get more details from Luis about\
  \ where my hotel is. Nada. We stop in a lay-by where he calls a cabbie comrade for\
  \ help. He compacts our dilemma into a long breathless sentence, points left, then\
  \ right, hangs up, and drives away again, muttering something. \n\nWe're now in\
  \ a sharp descent, and Luis is swinging me into the windows, the tyres yelping on\
  \ my behalf. As we straighten out, he pulls his phone out again. I think he's bringing\
  \ up Google Maps. Nope. He's swiping left for \u201CNo\u201D and right  for \u201C\
  Yes\u201D on a dating app with the same hand on the wheel. Too shocked to speak,\
  \ I envision how Maria, 34, a brunette nurse from Envigado, cluelessly caused us\
  \ to sail off a cliff-edge into the shiny valley before I even discovered my hotel!\
  \ My hands are at maximum tuck.\n\nIt's gone midnight as we reach a remote restaurant\
  \ up a steep dirt road, where Luis finds another cabbie comrade - who is just leaving\
  \ - to interrogate. Between them, they make arching gestures to show we're on completely\
  \ the wrong side of the mountain. We set off again.\n\nLuis keeps swiping while\
  \ driving. I pray silently. After 15 minutes, we reach a residential driveway up\
  \ another hill. Five dogs surround us, barking furiously as the homeowner comes\
  \ to his balcony and points back the way we came. Luis apparently doesn't agree,\
  \ points in all directions again, shakes his head and away we once more. Hope is\
  \ all I have now.\n\nAbout an hour into our midnight safari, just around a pessimistic\
  \ looking corner, a run of lights appear like a landing strip, mercifully guiding\
  \ the way to the \u201CEco Bosque Hotel\u201D. Luis jumps out, scrapes my bag out\
  \ of his boot and demands another 25,000 Pesos for getting lost. I think of a dozen\
  \ things to say and don't say any of them. I pay. I'm exhausted. We made it. He\
  \ pumps my hand again. My eyes narrow again. \u201CAdios amigo!\u201D, he blares.\
  \ I reciprocate and head for my room. Hasta ma\xF1ana, Medellin - I'll be arriving\
  \ on a bus."
