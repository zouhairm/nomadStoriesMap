Text: "I had never ridden a train before until I was halfway across the world. It\
  \ departured from Leningradsky station in Moscow around noon, we'd arrived in Vilnius\
  \ next morning. Or at least we believed so. \n\nIt was a night ride along with 89\
  \ fellow Mexicans students and a bunch of unknown Eastern Europeans. After five\
  \ hours of laughing and playing cards with my friends, the teacher in charge of\
  \ my group approached to us with a hint of stress on his face.\n\n\"Guys, I'm very\
  \ sorry to inform of a change of plans in the schedule\" he paused, then added \"\
  but we have to get off the train like... right now, just in the next stop so please,\
  \ as quickly as you can, gather your stuff, form a line and just wait there, because\
  \ when the train stops, we have five minutes to get off... the 89 of us\". The man\
  \ who less than an hour before was laughing and making new friends on the cafe wagon\
  \ let us know that the travel agency never informed us (nor got us) about the Belarussian\
  \ transit visa to get us from Russia to Lithuania, so the wisest thing was to stay\
  \ in Russia that night and avoid any international affair with its neighbor.\n\n\
  So, a couple of minutes after the shocking anouncement we gathered in line, our\
  \ lugagge in one hand and the fear of the unknown on the other. Little more than\
  \ five minutes took us to descent from the train, in the middle of the night in\
  \ a lonely and obscure green station of a remote town in the border between Russia\
  \ and Belarus. Yeah, only in the movies.\n\nOne hour later, but I swear it felt\
  \ like an eternity, one passenger bus appeared from the almost-darkness of the night\
  \ to transport us to a hotel to get rest. What would happen the next day, was a\
  \ mistery even for the teacher in command.\n\nThree rides took for the bus driver\
  \ to get the 89 of us, plus our lugagge, to our gloomy shelter for the night. Where\
  \ were we? The name of the city was Smolensk.\n\nThe scenary was: we couldn't go\
  \ South bound, surrounding Belarus passing over Ukraine and Poland to get to Lithuania\
  \ because we didn't have the Ukrainian visa either, so the option was going North,\
  \ over Latvia and then Lithuania.\n\nThe next day, two passenger buses this time\
  \ brought us to one of the border crossings Russia has with Latvia (like with other\
  \ 13 countries) close to a town name Zilupe. We formed a very big line outside of\
  \ a booth, between two lines of cars and motorcycles fill with curious eyes watching\
  \ us from their windows.\n\nOne by one, we crossed the first booth, an unsmiling\
  \ russian officer stamped our passports and dispatched us to the next step; some\
  \ meters ahead, another booth, this as well with the long line of cars waiting to\
  \ cross after us. \n\nNever in my life I had seen patient drivers like those I witnessed\
  \ there, in the longest white night. It took four hours this time, in groups of\
  \ five people, to cross this booth, having our custom forms filled by hand by another\
  \ russian officer with the amazing translation services of the extremely nice and\
  \ professional, not to mention handsome, latvian tourist guide who crossed us there,\
  \ and took the best care of us.\n\nThe clock went from 10pm to 2am, the thermometer\
  \ went down and down and the light never fade. Jackets, scarves, blankets and even\
  \ towels appeared to cover us from the cold of the russian summer (to which we as\
  \ Mexicans weren't used to) and protect us from getting eaten alive by the mosquitoes.\n\
  \nThird and forth booths were just quickly passed, with the inquiring look of the\
  \ Russian (or Latvian) officers watching us and wondering how come 89 Mexican students\
  \ were crossing by foot. Some steps onwards, we could read the sign informing us\
  \ that we had made it to Latvia.\n\nWhat was ahead of us, still some hours to reach\
  \ Vilnius and enjoy an overdue hotel bed, a delicious western breakfast and some\
  \ more adventures to live."
