Text: "Thirty six: the number of people our coaster minibus from Kampala to Masaka\
  \ is designed to transport. It's just under a week until Christmas and Ugandans\
  \ are headed home to their extended families. \n\nThey're laden with suitcases,\
  \ parcels, packages, loaves of bread and bags of clothes \u2014 luggage that's quickly\
  \ stuffed, stashed, stacked and tied onto any available surface. Human cargo is\
  \ no exception, as mothers breastfeeding babies fit a second or third or fourth\
  \ child on their laps, rotating fussy mouths between vacant arms until they're collectively\
  \ quieted. \n\nOur conductors \u2014 two young men with high cheekbones and toothy\
  \ grins that eclipse half their faces \u2014 acrobatically jump and swing from metal\
  \ shelves overhead, fitting \"just one more\" on board until we've unhealthily exceeded\
  \ our bus' recommended bum-to-seat ratio.\n\nTwo: the number of hours my Lonely\
  \ Planet guidebook says it will take to arrive in Masaka. In all reality, it's the\
  \ number of hours we take to meander out of Kampala's taxi park, as vehicles don't\
  \ leave until they're full \u2014 and then some. \n\nOur conductors struggle to\
  \ close the door as we depart, contorting like human pretzels to fill the seemingly\
  \ non-existent spaces between limbs and luggage. As the sliding door clicks into\
  \ place, they flash me a bemused smile, the twinkle in their eyes indicating an\
  \ obvious amusement at my mzungu lack of faith. \n\n\"After all,\" their expressions\
  \ seem to say, \"This is Africa, where anything is possible.\"\n\nTwenty: the number\
  \ of minutes it takes to make our first stop, and the number of seconds it takes\
  \ for our coaster to be surrounded by locals selling Fanta, cellphone airtime, and\
  \ some sort of indiscernible meat on a stick. One by one, children bodysurf through\
  \ the windows \u2014 five youngsters reunited with their mother after a stay with\
  \ relatives in a nearby village. \n\nBack on the road, we pass a total of seven\
  \ traffic police with somewhat baited breath, who blink not an eye at 50+ passengers\
  \ squeezed and sweating in the muggy cabin, rationing water to avoid an all-too-imminent\
  \ bush toilet stop. It's a battle of thirst vs. bladder, no one wanting to force\
  \ yet another delay to our journey.\n\nFifty five: the kilometres left to Masaka\
  \ when we slow to a crawl, the vehicle's overworked engine vocally protesting as\
  \ it labours across bumps, potholes and dusty hills. Hoping to hide the troubling\
  \ rumble from his passengers, our driver blasts Celine Dion, as if \"The Power of\
  \ Love\" can deliver us to our destination.\n\nBut somehow her song does. Five hours\
  \ later, with little to no acceleration, our crippled coaster coasts into Masaka,\
  \ bleeding passengers along the road as they reunite with family. My maiden overland\
  \ voyage in Uganda, I have no way of knowing whether this is the norm.\n\nThat is,\
  \ until l glance at our seasoned conductors.\n\nTwo. Still smiling with impish cheekiness.\
  \ \"While anything is possible in Africa,\" their satisfied expressions seem to\
  \ say, \"Nothing is predictable.\""
