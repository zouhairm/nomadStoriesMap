Text: "As I was about to complete my fourth week working as a volunteer in Argentina,\
  \ Buenos Aires, a couple of friends of mine told me that they would come and stay\
  \ for two days in a Hostel downtown. Unfortunately, my experience as a volunteer\
  \ was not what I expected. I was about to take of a week earlier because of all\
  \ that happened. \n\nThe year of 2017 had just started and I was fresh out of high\
  \ school. It was holidays until the results of our National exam so I decided to\
  \ travel. Got a really nice opportunity to teach English for children in the Argentinian\
  \ Capital. I chose to go there to improve my Spanish and also to get to know another\
  \ culture by being immersed in a local family. That was all promised by the NGO.\
  \ They operate all across the globe. Not to blame them, as an organization, but\
  \ its true that the BA\u2019S committee was overload by that time.\n\nI ended up\
  \ with four others Brazilians in a house that was for sale, in a quite dangerous\
  \ neighborhood. For about 5 weeks we lived there meanwhile having to take two buses\
  \ and one train to our project. As we had to be there at nine we used to wake at\
  \ six. Having to wash our clothes in a bucket and to sleep in a mattress on the\
  \ floor became pretty standard. The biggest one was shared by me and the other two\
  \ girls. It was not easy, but looking back I\u2019m sure that I would have the whole\
  \ experience again. I grew so much on such a short time. At the first day at the\
  \ project, we were faced not with kids running around screaming as imagined. Instead,\
  \ we were pretty shocked to find out that we were actually allocated into a rehab\
  \ center, only for men, from 14 to 50 years old.\n\nThat we were pretty angry at\
  \ the NGO I won\u2019t lie, they were making promises that they simple could not\
  \ keep. They kept saying that staying at that house was only for a short period\
  \ of time. We volunteered at the clinic for about 5 weeks. One day heading back\
  \ home we together decided to put an end to all of that. It was pretty hurtful.\
  \ The problem was not the project, which we learned to love and to care so much,\
  \ always creating new ways to interact with the interns, whether by playing soccer\
  \ or cooking together. The thing is that we were to tired of asking repeatedly for\
  \ what was agreed.  \n\nAnd that takes me back to that weekend. The results from\
  \ our National Exam were out that Friday night. I really thought I would be accepted\
  \ for International Relations, at a public University in my hometown, Brasilia.\
  \ To get over that, we headed to a typical night at the most agitated neighborhood\
  \ in Buenos Aires, Palermo. The entrance was free in almost every club until 3 with\
  \ an open bar until 6. We arrived at a club at one and found out that we were the\
  \ first to arrive. When the club was full at 4, we were so wasted. I spotted a fight\
  \ about to start right where my friends were. It was jut in timeI to see one of\
  \ them being punched right on his face. I tried to go and separate them.\n\nThe\
  \ next thing that I remember was being forced out of the party. I encountered all\
  \ of my friends outside trying to figure out what just happened. Found out later\
  \ that my friend was actually the one that started everything by pushing the other\
  \ guy on the wall.  We were all drunk and with no idea on how to get back. I do\
  \ remember being the one responsible of staying awake. While standing inside that\
  \ bus I had a profound epiphany that came to me out of nowhere. Suddenly, I knew\
  \ that everything would be just fine. I felt as nothing could ever stand on my way\
  \ to realize my dreams. This I quite a rare occasion, everything was making sense\
  \ and i knew that I were at the right place at the right time ."
