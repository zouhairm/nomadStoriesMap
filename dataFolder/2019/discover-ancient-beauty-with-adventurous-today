Text: "Discovering Costa Maya Mexico in 8  hours is not for the Faint hearted. Travel\
  \ to costamya on the cruise MSC seaside was a adventure in it self . Costa Maya\
  \ is a small tourist region in the municipality of Oth\xF3n P. Blanco in the state\
  \ of Quintana Roo, Mexico, the only state bounded by the Caribbean Sea to its easthad.\
  \ Docking in Costa Maya for only 8 hoursmeant we had to do  as much as we can in\
  \ a short time Or you could opt to just relax  next to that swimming pool and mall\
  \ Built only for cruise ship travelers at the Costa Maya the port. The mall is beautiful\
  \ with authentic Mexican Shop\u2019s and even flamingo relaxing next to you at the\
  \ pool . My family and I love to Discover new things and Experience new cultures,\
  \ So we decided to go and explore! Traveling with a family of four you always have\
  \ to think double So we Decided to rent a Off road jeeps. I say off road because\
  \ there isn\u2019t really any roads to travel by but with a local map and sum Guidance\
  \ from a local, Traveling  through  The rain forest was an awesome experience one\
  \ that I will truly never forget .We had the opportunity to really see how the people\
  \  of Costa Maya live . Among the Mayan Ruins these humble poeple live a humble\
  \ live With the beautiful turquoise ocean on there doorstep. Traveling Past small\
  \ villages where all you need is in one street next to Each other in Makeshift ruin\
  \ buildings a Liquor store , the General wholesaler and a hotel ( Which I will not\
  \ recommend) We Found ourselves on a private beach. When I say private I mean none\
  \ of the other tourists who traveled with us on the Msc Cruise discovered This beautiful\
  \ white sand turquoise Ocean beach! It was spectacular the ocean was quiet,warm\
  \ and inviting. One of the locals advisers us on where to snorkel so we could see\
  \ the Mayan  ruins trapped under the beautiful turquoise ocean.  It\u2019s felt\
  \ like I could spend forever and a day snorkeling this site but one of the downfalls\
  \ traveling on a cruise is that you have to stick to the timetable . Once we decided\
  \ that we Kinda have to get out of the ocean The locals treated us with a Authentic\
  \ Mexican lunch.  Tacos and tequila ! Just saying that makes my mouth water. They\
  \ Explained to us the true art  of making a real tequila And made us taste all the\
  \ different variations,We were also educated on how to check If the tequila whe\
  \ buy Is real or not! But to be totally honest after all the tequila tasting I will\
  \ have to go back to get a better education on tequila bying. The tacos whas Offered\
  \ to us at just the right time. Nothing complements a good tequila quite like a\
  \ good taco and I promise Everything taste different in Mexico, I think it\u2019\
  s the Mexican soil. The Tomatoes and chilies tasted Wholesome Accompanied by the\
  \ awesome hospitality of the Costa Maya\u2019n  people this simple Heartfelt lunch\
  \ was Definitely one of my favorite meals on my trip to the Caribbean. We sadly\
  \ had to make our way back to the port to be in time to depart on our cruise but\
  \ Leaving Costa Maya I know I will be back to Exsperians more that this awesome\
  \ Authentic Mexican Port has to over."
