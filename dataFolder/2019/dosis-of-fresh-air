Text: "Sometimes while we travel we might see more than just a stunning view. If we\
  \ look with our heart we can also find answers to our questions when we least expect\
  \ it. \n\nLast winter, in the cable car on the way to the top of Mont Blanc, I was\
  \ feeling not only the atmospheric pressure hurting my ears as we climbed up, but\
  \ also the insistence thought of not being good enough for the life I chose. \n\n\
  After deciding for a path different from what\u2019s expected, I felt a huge weight\
  \ on my shoulders because I had to succeed and prove myself to be right.\n\n\u201C\
  It\u2019s impossible, you can\u2019t, you won\u2019t make it\u201D I was told...\
  \ and I started believing it. Everyday was uncertain and confusing for me. \n\n\
  As soon as the cable car doors opened I felt the pure and very cold mountain air\
  \ taking away all my insecurities, worries and fears. With every breathe I took,\
  \ everything started to make more sense. \n\nI was filling myself with an immense\
  \ dosis of appreciation for life!\n\nFinally I could breathe without any tension.\
  \ I felt freedom and excitement appropiating of my body as the snowflakes fall smoothly\
  \  in front of me. I did a snowball and threw it into the abism along with my deepest\
  \ fears and realized how far I have come. \n\nI went back down inspired to return\
  \ into reality been authentic. Since then, I stand to my beliefs leaving all doubts\
  \ up there and ready to adventure into my new life. \n\nI trust myself and the life\
  \ I chose feeling every day that amazing fresh air from the Alps in my lungs."
