Text: "Everything looks unexpected when you drive yourself out from your comfort zone.\
  \ Never thought of traveling and staying for one year in any European country. \
  \ The dream came true when I finally reached to Germany. This exchange program helped\
  \ me to learn and get out of my comfort zone. This one year journey and I have whole\
  \ Europe to travel. The confusion was driving crazy in the mind where to go, how\
  \ to travel, from where to start. The fact is true when you have a lot it always\
  \ ends up with confusion. Finally, I decided to travel outside of Germany and at\
  \ very first, my idea was to visit Prague the city of Bridges. Prague gave me extraordinary\
  \ and unexpected memories. The old town is crazy and the new town is way more creative.\
  \ Every place is unique and has a great architecture.\nDeciding to travel by bus\
  \ was a good option because then you end up your traveling in a pocket-friendly\
  \ manner. The best part is that you can see the places on the way and then get more\
  \ excited. For me, it was the time I was counting the minutes to get down in the\
  \ city. Always when you get into a new city, the first thing to target is to find\
  \ a place to sleep and dump your beg so that you can a walk around. The Idea of\
  \ finding a couch surfer was amazing as the person knows the city and surrounding.\
  \ The walk in the old town on that evening was immense. It is difficult to find\
  \ out a place but easy when you know some local. I remember those cobble path to\
  \ walk on. You can imagine the life of the people from history. The more I was walking\
  \ and exploring myself the more I wanted to know the surrounding. The life in the\
  \ European country is not how expected its way more than that. \nThe next morning\
  \ in Prague was way more exciting than my first day in there. Got to know the locals\
  \ and their culture. The bier in the old town tastes amazing, especially with the\
  \ typical Czech food. Although it was difficult to find vegan food but worth searching.\
  \ Meeting the local people and letting know their daily life as an outsider gives\
  \ a sense of cultural shock. I was loving being there and mingling with new people.\
  \ I didn't go there with a plan because that sound more purposefully to me. I keep\
  \ on walking and the city started changing its color. In the evening the Charles\
  \ bridge was filled with the happening surrounding. There was music, laugh, dance,\
  \ and a lot. On the very next day I was about the leave the city I started missing\
  \ it. The time spent there still pulls me toward it. My first-time experience as\
  \ a solo traveler in the European country went way more exciting as I thought it\
  \ to be."
