Text: "Every time I thought about going to Busan, I imagined it would be by train.\
  \ But, when you are in a hurry because it's a last minute trip, you basically have\
  \ no money left, and you are going to leave the country in two weeks, you don't\
  \ have much of a choice. That's how I ended up in a 6 hours trip bus to the coastal\
  \ city, with my so far best friend and roommate, a polish girl called Addie. \n\t\
  It was already my sixth month in South Korea, and I was extremely excited about\
  \ visiting a new city - mainly because I heard great things about Busan. Addie had\
  \ been there once before, but it was my first time. On the bus, we made plans, and\
  \ the first one was definitely going to a franchise of our favorite bar. Well, we\
  \ were going to get there by night, so there was not much we could do anyways. \n\
  \tOnce we got to the bus station, we texted our friend, Jinny. We were going to\
  \ stay at her house for the weekend. We asked for directions, using the subway's\
  \ wi-fi, and took the train. Lucky us, it was in the same line. Half an hour later\
  \ - it was around 11:30 PM - we arrived at the station. Jinny has told us to take\
  \ a bus, but in the maps it seemed so close that we decided to take a walk. I was\
  \ looking forward to breathing the night's air and take a look over the city. Neither\
  \ of us had data on our phones, so we just screenshot the away before leaving. And\
  \ soon, we realize that taking a walk was a mistake.\n\tBusan is a high mountain\
  \ city. So, after not more than five minutes, we faced our first round of stairs.\
  \ It was, at least, 100 stair steps. We grabbed our handbags and climbed it. Feeling\
  \ like winners when we reached the top, just to figure out there was more.  And\
  \ we couldn't even appreciate the view - there was no view, just weird alleys and\
  \ empty streets. When we climbed the second stair, and we saw there was even more,\
  \ we gave up. We decided to take the road - the away was longer, but easier apparently.\
  \ I was exhausted, but our craving to go to the bar was moving me forward - this\
  \ and the fact we didn't have any internet at the moment. \n\tWhen we finally got\
  \ to Jinny's house, she was in the streets, in her pajamas and looking worried.\
  \ I could saw the relieve on her face when she saw was. She immediately brought\
  \ us inside the house, and here was my surprise; we were welcomed with a warm hug\
  \ from her mother and the happiest dog I've ever seen. A lot of people think Koreans\
  \ are cold - and, in fact, some of them are. But these two women - and the dog -\
  \ were so kind and caring, I felt like it was my home too. The house was not big,\
  \ but comfortable. Our bedroom was prepared; cleaned and with an electric blanket\
  \ to protect us from the cold weather. And the dinner was ready!\n\tJinny's mother\
  \ cooked for us earlier. The table was full of Korean dishes and sides: bibimbap\
  \ (rice), kimchi soup and, my favorite, bulgogi (meat). The food was delicious,\
  \ more than I could imagine, and better than a lot of restaurants I went to. While\
  \ I was eating and talking to them about our trip and local cultures, I realized\
  \ that I had never tried homemade Korean food before. Actually, I had never stayed\
  \ at a traditional Korean house. \n\tThe thing is, during my time in Korea, I moved\
  \ out six times - I lived in goshiwons (small rooms), guesthouses, university dorm\
  \ and was currently sharing a studio apartment with two friends. But never a Korean's\
  \ family house. I even forgot about going to the bar, and so did Addie. We had been\
  \ by ourselves for so long, away from our own houses and family. And, for the first\
  \ time in so long, I was feeling so comfortable and warm, that I noticed I almost\
  \ forgot how good it could be just staying at home."
