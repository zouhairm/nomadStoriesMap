Text: "Last year I decided to start off the year by taking a day trip to the capital\
  \ of Norway, Oslo. I booked some really cheap same-day flights and was hoping to\
  \ cram all the Scandinavian sights and even a little skiing within a total of 12\
  \ hours. I had done this before in the past with cities like Cologne and Copenhagen,\
  \ so I really thought it was possible. It was the start of January and the weather\
  \ had really started to affect us heavily around Europe. The day that lied ahead\
  \ would have been considered a disaster and inconvenience for many, but as somebody\
  \ who strongly believes in pre-destiny, it came to my attention that in life it\
  \ is not always about the final destination, but the journey and memories you make\
  \ along the way.\n\nAfter being delayed to take off by 2 hours on the plane, we\
  \ did not really get to a good start. Being on a time crunch as it was only a day\
  \ trip for me, I had to start crossing out activities that I would not be able to\
  \ make anymore. After a short 1.5 hour flight, the pilot informed us that we were\
  \ not able to land the plane due to the heavy snow on the runway. After circling\
  \ around for another hour, the pilot had made a decision to divert to a town called\
  \ Stavanger, located a 6-hour journey from the capital. \n\nAs many passengers were\
  \ stressed about the diversion, we had started to become a bit vocal. Because of\
  \ this, everybody started to chat and share out their snacks and drinks whilst complaining\
  \ to the air stewards! We had learned that many passengers were from the United\
  \ States, and they were actually going to Oslo in order to catch their connecting\
  \ flight. We had all got to know each other and despite the total of 3 takeoffs\
  \ and landings in multiple Norwegian airports over a period of 10 hours, we actually\
  \ started to enjoy our time together and made light of the circumstances.\n \nThis\
  \ is where my travel story becomes bizarre. I had personally made friends with 2\
  \ people sat next to me on the flight, a man and a woman from New York. We had made\
  \ a pact that if we were to ever land in Oslo with some remaining time to spare,\
  \ we should all check out a few of the sights together. We were particularly keen\
  \ on Ice Skating in the park. When the plane finally landed in its final destination,\
  \ we then had to make our way on a 2-hour train journey to the airport, where we\
  \ were meant to land originally! We had gotten along so well and really got to know\
  \ each other. By the time we had reached the airport and made it to our connecting\
  \ flights, it was actually really emotional to part. We had only known each other\
  \ for about 9 hours yet we felt like we had gone through a lot together. Since that\
  \ day last year, we had stayed in touch via social media with each other and actually\
  \ 1 of them is now considered my best friend and travel soul sister. We have been\
  \ to Paris, Barcelona, Milan, Rome, Prague, Dublin, London, Amsterdam and Berlin\
  \ together! We also have upcoming plans this year to go to Los Angeles, the famous\
  \ Coachella festival and to spend my 21st Birthday in her home city, New York! \n\
  The beauty of my travel story is that although things are not always what they appear,\
  \ everything happens for a reason. We may get stressed about certain situations\
  \ (like we all were that day when we could not arrive into Oslo), but the outcome\
  \ of that situation was better than I could ever imagine. I have now made a friend\
  \ for life, that shares the same passion as me and we can continue together creating\
  \ memories around the globe for years to come (using the same airlines that got\
  \ us stranded..no hard feelings!)."
