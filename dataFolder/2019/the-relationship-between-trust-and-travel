Text: "Imagine, just for a second, that you\u2019re me.\n\nImagine that you\u2019\
  re in your late 20's, making your way to Italy. With your ex-boyfriend. \nImagine\
  \ you\u2019re about to enjoy simple and honest Tuscan flavours. With a messy and\
  \ complicated heart. \n\nWhile I may have checked in my baggage an hour before my\
  \ flight, I felt a heavy load in seat #23A. \nDaniel had ended our relationship\
  \ two weeks before our trip to Rome had started. We\u2019d spent months daydreaming\
  \ about sparkling transparent waters, archaeological treasures and homemade fennel\
  \ and prosciutto Tuscan pasta, with porcini mushroom and white truffle sauce. After\
  \ I\u2019d been served a dollop of fresh heartbreak, my ex was exasperated when\
  \ I wanted to pull out. It felt as if he had spat at my sensibility and was irritated\
  \ with my instinct to protect myself. My friends had encouraged me to not give up\
  \ on myself or my relationship with travel. My plan was to pretend my heart was\
  \ okay and to mask my need for healthy interdependence with unhealthy independence.\
  \  \n\nMost travel, and certainly the rewarding kind, involves depending on the\
  \ kindness of strangers, putting yourself into the hands of people you don\u2019\
  t know and trusting them with your life. But for every relationship that has been\
  \ strengthened by travel, there is one that has been fractured.\n\nMy past traveling\
  \ adventures had always made me feel lighter and fuller. This experience was different.\
  \ As our flight took off, I felt heavier and emptier. To quote Paul Young: \u201C\
  Pain has a way of clipping our wings and keeping us from being able to fly. If left\
  \ unresolved, you can almost forget that you were created to fly in the first place.\u201D\
  \ \n\nThis awkward travel invitation unfolded into a dancing lesson from god. If\
  \ travel were a person, he would be a kind and wise gentleman, opening the gate\
  \ for the caged eagle in me to remember who I was again and to soar. As the trip\
  \ unraveled, I learnt that my longings for a partner were simply yearnings to partner\
  \ again with my deep sense of curiosity and exuberance about the world. I gave up\
  \ on being a caged eagle in a zoo.\n\n12 days later, I felt my heart flop into a\
  \ pool of peace on the train ride back to Rome airport. The ringing of shame had\
  \ been replaced by the sensuous sound of water lapping against the walls of Venice\u2019\
  s ancient palazzi and the intoxicating fragrance of citrus blossoms in Sicily. A\
  \ kind stranger had helped me with my baggage at the train station. His sunglasses\
  \ slid over his eyes as he said goodbye to me and I sensed he was crying. I was\
  \ moved. He hadn\u2019t given me butterflies in my stomach. He had given me eagles.\
  \ My heart threatened to burst it was so full of love. The orange dahlias were still\
  \ smiling drinking up the sun. \n\nIt\u2019s easy to have a knee-jerk reaction of\
  \ mistrust as we travel through life and wrestle with our own hearts. It feels like\
  \ the best course of action, to protect ourselves by taking every possible precaution.\
  \  But this doesn\u2019t come without a price. In refusing to trust strangers while\
  \ traveling, we run the risk of missing out on trusting human connection\u2013and\
  \ what is travel without it?\n\nThe Italian summer continued to beat on like the\
  \ rhythm of a clothes dryer. After a fig and burrata pizza for lunch followed by\
  \ lavender pancetta, my belly was full. But my heart was fuller. Travel had expanded\
  \ me and there was fresh space to trust again. I closed my eyes to old ends and\
  \ opened my heart to new beginnings. Italy had drunk me up with its eyes and I no\
  \ longer longed for Daniel\u2019s attention.\n\nThe fact that I love travel interfered\
  \ with the plans I had for my life and the plans others had for me. My heart had\
  \ been apprehended by a great love that compelled me to live differently.  \n\n\
  Travel is like love. You cannot find it. You can only hide from it. It finds you.\
  \ \nLeaping into the unknown isn\u2019t painful. Holding onto an illusion of control\
  \ is."
