Text: "Leaving or not leaving, that is the question!\nMy instinct always says: go!\
  \ And so I did, for years, I experimented several experiences in different projects\
  \ and met people from all around the world. \nWhat we expect from these experience\
  \ is always something theoretical, what they become afterward is something we never\
  \ know until they become memories.\nThe beautiful aspect of this formula is that\
  \ the more the memories, the greater the expectations. They are directly proportional,\
  \ it\u2019s mathematical! \nSo, now I am here with a lot of memories from my trips\
  \ and an unfathomable desire to go, exactly the way I used to do when I was 20,\
  \ but with more awareness of what travelling means and still with the constant black-out\
  \ you necessarily have when going to some new and unexpected place.\nBecause, let\u2019\
  s say it, the cultural shock never ends, even if you are an experienced traveller!\n\
  \nBut, what are the aspect of a cultural shock? \nAfter one of my experiences in\
  \ Germany I realized that I had no idea, before leaving, about what I was going\
  \ to do. \n\nThe first fundamental thing to know (or to discover) when you go abroad\
  \ is where you are going to live, where your new home will be. Your new room, the\
  \ place where you are going to stay is the hardest point to imagine, every time\
  \ you move abroad. It\u2019s the most private space in your new universe, so it\u2019\
  s something that needs to be aligned to your needs, because it\u2019s where you\
  \ hide to face your difficulties.\n\nThen, how your working place is going to be.\
  \ It can be studying, working or also adventure with no definitions. How your colleagues\
  \ will be, and if you are going to find allies. What kind of difficulties you are\
  \ going to have and what you are going to love.\nOur job is an important part of\
  \ our life and contributes to make us feel happy or willing to run away from a place.\n\
  \nPeople, friends. One other essential part of our life. You never know if you are\
  \ finding a treasure or a big disaster of human relationships, and let\u2019s say\
  \ it, the older you are, the hardest it is to find good friends. People I am going\
  \ to deal with are one of the things that terrify me the most, but my experience\
  \ taught me that what the others say is not always true: I left pieces of my heart\
  \ in almost every trip I took. To people I met and I have a deep relation with.\n\
  I left one of my secrets in Sardinia, the confession I am afraid to tell in Leipzig,\
  \ my good vibes somewhere between Romania and South Africa and my best memories,\
  \ hopes and disappointments in Berlin.\n\nOther aspects you don\u2019t get to know\
  \ until you experiment them are things like local food (I am Italian and this is\
  \ an essential component of my trips). You can hear about how delicious food is\
  \ somewhere but you never know the real taste until you eat it, by yourself. Or\
  \ how (un)safe a city is. The articles you read about a city are never as true as\
  \ your own experience teaches: my family is from Naples, known as a dangerous city,\
  \ but my sister was robbed in Milan, known as a safe city.\n\nLast, but not least,\
  \ is the possibility of homesickness. Personally, I was never considering it, because\
  \ when I was really young it was easy to just go, with no problems or doubts. Now,\
  \ I am 28 and things are changing. The way I live the travelling itself is changing:\
  \ still with the spirit of a teenager but aware of what I am doing, why I am doing\
  \ it and where I am going to. And calling my family more often than I used to do\
  \ 8 years ago. \n\nFinally, every trip hides something unknown behind the corner,\
  \ it\u2019s up to us to decide if we want to get it and how much we want to invest\
  \ in it!"
