Text: "July 19th 2018: Indistinct chatter in languages galore, vivid attires and traditional\
  \ costumes, decadent delicacies from around the world and a myriad of ethnic groups\
  \ were all present. The auditorium at Robert Bosch United World College, Freiburg\
  \ was witnessing a Cultural evening put up by 153 students from 71 countries representing\
  \ their land, culture and ideas. Looking at everyone gathered there, I could not\
  \ help but marvel at our differences - there were beautiful Kyrgyz girls wearing\
  \ embellished \u2018beldemchis\u2019- traditional Kyrgyz skirts, proud African girls\
  \ with their impressive Senegalese twists dancing to their groovy tunes, young Taiwanese\
  \ boys playing and impressing everyone with their \u2018diabolo\u2019 tricks \u2013\
  \ a sort of giant yoyo which is juggled and balanced on a string - and the Egyptians\
  \ giving everyone a glimpse of their ancient culture.\nMiles away from home, all\
  \ of us were gathered in Freiburg, Germany. The weather was cold - the irony being\
  \ that Freiburg was the sunniest city in Germany. Beautiful trees surrounded the\
  \ auditorium and the dark cloudless sky was studded with diamond stars.  \nOne by\
  \ one each country talked about their culture and ideas. It was beautiful and mesmerizing.\
  \ The sheer diversity present in the human race was astounding. The attires and\
  \ dances and the songs that people sung hinted at our uniqueness as countries and\
  \ different ethnic groups. \nIt was a rather eventful evening and a rather spectacular\
  \ experience almost like travelling the world - in under 5 hours and witnessing\
  \ the all cultures under one roof. As I was thinking about all of this, the next\
  \ performance was announced. The Romanians and the Moldovans were presenting a skit.\
  \ It was a powerful skit about how the two countries were separated and divided\
  \ rather cruelly thanks to the politicians who would go to any lengths to fulfill\
  \ their power-lust even if the cost of it be the deaths of thousands of innocent\
  \ souls and destroyed cities. The citizens yearned for peace and togetherness but\
  \ the politicians would not allow it. I could not help but think as everyone stood\
  \ up to applaud the students, how similar it was to our situation with Pakistan\
  \ - a country who shares our history and culture but unfortunately all that breeds\
  \ between us is hatred. \nAs the night progressed, it became clear that despite\
  \ the differences that separated us, the values that were embedded in all our hearts\
  \ were the same. All of us had a desire for love and oneness. Our ideas and values\
  \ crossed all cultural barriers, political boundaries and social walls and coincided.\
  \ We might have slightly different dance forms but each form made our hearts exult\
  \ in joy, the songs irrespective of the language made us sing along, the food from\
  \ every region teased and tantalized our palates and it was evident that all of\
  \ us strived for the same things in life that is peace and joy. \n I did not expect\
  \ to find such variety in our world that made us unique and yet the similarity that\
  \ brought us together. I did not expect to find such diversity and yet such unity.\
  \ I stood in the United world college that night- cherishing our differences, celebrating\
  \ our individuality and yet drinking in the sense of oneness that surrounded us.\
  \ I did not expect to find a home among these people hailing from different regions,\
  \ speaking different languages, in a land so far away from home. \nNever had the\
  \ Sankrit phrase \u2018vasudhaiva kutumbakam\u2019 - the world is one family' made\
  \ more sense. \nAnd as we returned to our hostel that night, cold chilly wind forcing\
  \ us all to come closer sharing the warmth radiating from our bodies and hearts,\
  \ the bright moon in the cloudless sky shining on us - a bright source of light\
  \ in the darkness, symbolic of the light of love and unity that emerges victorious\
  \ over the differences that separate us. We walked through the fields, among the\
  \ long grown grasses, beside the \u2018Dreisam\u2019 - the serene gushing of the\
  \ river providing a soothing undertone to our deep conversations in the dead of\
  \ the night as we walked back with a new perspective, a deeper understanding of\
  \ the world and of the people that make it, realizing that it's a beautiful world\
  \ indeed."
