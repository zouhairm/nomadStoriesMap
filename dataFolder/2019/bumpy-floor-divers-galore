Text: "Parrying with the majestic sights of Radha beach at Havelock within 30 minutes\
  \ format won't have passed muster unless the need of the last moment ushered us\
  \ to the exotic, like anyother place at Havelock, for Scuba diving. \nThe moment\
  \ after the consent form signed in, in no time did all put their strips on, wore\
  \ off binges and buckled up for a would-be-diver spirit. \nDivers whooped as they\
  \ plunged into the shallow of the sea. That was the site where those 45 minutes'\
  \ session for underdiving headed, ofwhich first 15-20 minutes were reserved for\
  \ training, enough to ground oneself up while diving. \nI'd believed it to be a\
  \ complicated one but turns out as an easy peasy task anyone could afford to.Yea,\
  \ exceptions always come in way. Stay away high BP owners, heart disease roomers\
  \ and their neighbours. \nAnd there I saw the sea in gross by the shallows, all\
  \ blazing in its clear b'ful blue charm that seemed to have voiced -  I'm all defic\
  \ you'd have ever seen in your life. \nWe started off, then started over until the\
  \ conscience gave a go ahead call. \nDefying the gravity, unearthing some unexplored\
  \ hues of thrill, we were completely zeroed into the lit glory of underwater world,\
  \ Bay of Bengal. The weightlessness, b'ful coral formations, to-ings & fro-ings\
  \ of lovely marine species, all laid the foundation of that present breath. \nWhile\
  \ edging towards the seabed, makin' the driveway 30 meters down, some shifts are\
  \ likely to grasp you up :  The heart rate goin' down, blood pressure goin' up alongwith\
  \ respiratory rate and digestion as the body survives the increased pressure in\
  \ water than what under the same temperature it encounters in air. More precisely,\
  \ autonomic nervous system (ANS) is whole affected. \nTank of compressed air toted\
  \ on back, a hose for carrying air to mouthpiece, a facemask for covering the eyes\
  \ and nose, regulators that control air flow, gauges that indicate depth and how\
  \ much air remains in the tank were all the gears that outstretched the strip. \n\
  Then, poping the ears for equalising the pressure was another form of tactics that\
  \ was required to encapsulate the euphoria. \nPoping the ears?! Yes. By holding\
  \ the nostrils close through mask and blowing the nose. So when the head and ears\
  \ were pained for water pressure squeezed into the sinuses, we'd pop the ears up.\
  \ \nThe moment we reached at the limits, I touched the sea bed, standing. Over the\
  \ bumpy floor, dollops of corals. In front of us, was a hill of coral reef, majestic,\
  \ cutting above all as far as eyes could see, b'fully adorned with colourful sponges.\
  \ \n\nThere was one place where we weren't surrounded by corals but a clear way\
  \ across the pitch blue dark sea through which eyes could barely see. And hands\
  \ together, there goes the most thrilling moment ever God blew breath into inasmuch\
  \ the only exotic creature I could expect was a hammer hit white shark! Lol. How\
  \ perky would that be? \nRelax. We were far off the grid to meet that holy. \nAt\
  \ one time while in Scuba, the trainer would insist in sign language - dangle the\
  \ body upside down. Only I could prefer was to lean over upon 180 degrees to the\
  \ seabed,'cause a slight tilt in angling arms would rorate you, you've no idea of.While\
  \ leaning I recalled that chunk of training -  \n'If the water drips into you mask,\
  \ hold it pressing upside, then exhale from the nose.'\n' Dripping into the mask?!!\
  \ '\nThat was when I'd suppose to be practically applying were I laid upside down.\
  \ Nevertheless,the drip out practice hopefully went on the off chance to happen.\
  \ \nAt photography session, we met clownfish. Steadily it sashayed from it's humble\
  \ abode, sea anemone. Out then in, slowly. Ensuring the safety out of two paired\
  \ limbs, in the black strips. Ofcourse he did. Looked like if Mr Nemo was hankerin'\
  \ after heaven he'd come out on the porch atleast. \n\nIf you do one thing at Havelock.\
  \ Do this. Just buck up, step in, so sea would feel taken by your movings."
