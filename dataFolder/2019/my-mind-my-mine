Text: "I hope to soon relive the feeling I felt when we were in Mombasa, from arrival\
  \ to departure, it felt so strange, but, a good strange. It felt like we were embarking\
  \ on a new journey, starting from scratch. \nThe heat was moist, the air was dusty,\
  \ the area was vibrant and the people were so loud.\nIt felt so strange, yet, so\
  \ familiar. \nNights like this, I close my eyes and imagine I was in Mombasa, on\
  \ the back of the boda-boda, Ana in the middle, as we were driven through the traffic\
  \ of people in pitch blackness. \n\nI didn't expect to find my mind, my mine. \n\
  \n14th March 2017. A date that is now so significant to me. The day I left to travel\
  \ alone to Kenya. A dream of mine since I was 7 years old, 'I want to see East Africa'\
  \ I would often tell my parents. As a result, they would buy me Lonely Planet books\
  \ on the different regions in Africa. \nThis trip was not a holiday, I was off to\
  \ meet my friend, where we would volunteer at a Rescue Center. We had planned since\
  \ September 2016. \nI boarded the plane from Heathrow, London and landed in Nairobi,\
  \ Kenya. From Nairobi, I took a coach to Mombasa. Over 9 hours. Alone, no wifi,\
  \ no friends, broken earphones. Just me and the passengers. I used this time to\
  \ talk to God and embrace my surroundings. I was so thankful to be in the place\
  \ I had wanted to see for so long. \n\nAt last, Mombasa. Greeted by a large smile\
  \ and screams, I spotted my friend, Ana. Joy filled my heart as we embraced, Ana\
  \ had been here for a week and had been waiting for me to arrive. We hugged and\
  \ tears fled from our eyes as we remembered all we went through leading up to this\
  \ trip. \n\nI didn't expect to find my mind, my mine. \n\nEveryday I woke up with\
  \ a smile on my face. I had never felt such peace. Mombasa is a vibrant city. It\
  \ is filled with vibrant people, painted in vibrant colours and sprayed with heat.\
  \ There is a sense of community and you are somewhat forced to communicate with\
  \ others. It is very open. I have never felt so welcomed. My anxiety had disappeared,\
  \ despite the language barrier and being in a place that I had never been, I felt\
  \ at ease; I didn't expect to find my mind, my mine. \n\n\nIt has been two years\
  \ since I was with you, and since, I have been restless, frustrated and distant.\
  \ I feel out of place, disconnected and nostalgic; although I was with you for a\
  \ short period of time, it felt like a lifetime. \nI write about you often, so the\
  \ memories do not fade, I brag about you to my friends, to rid their preconceived\
  \ notions. \n\nI didn't expect to find my mind, my mine, in Mombasa."
