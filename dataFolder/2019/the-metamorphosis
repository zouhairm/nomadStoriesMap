Text: "The hike was only supposed to be an hour long. \n\nThat\u2019s what they had\
  \ told me at breakfast, back at the lodge, before also apologising that the only\
  \ guide available to hike with me spoke no English whatsoever. My broken, basic,\
  \ left-over-from-school-Spanish and I agreed, and it was with naive excitement and\
  \ expectations of seeing lots of cool animals that I set off on a morning hike into\
  \ Tambopata Reserve, in the middle of the Amazon Rainforest.\n\nThe way there was\
  \ easy enough. The ground felt springy as if there were plants waiting to burst\
  \ forth into the thick jungle air at any moment. The floor was alive with insects\
  \ crawling like a constantly moving congestion of conveyor belts, different species\
  \ in different directions. Down is the only direction I can properly describe since\
  \ I couldn\u2019t see more than a few feet in front of me at any given time. We\
  \ were surrounded on all sides by an impossibly detailed web of trees and vines\
  \ yet my guide forged us a path through, intermittently impersonating and echoing\
  \ even the strangest of birdsong, on the off chance it would bring an animal into\
  \ view. Our hike took longer than an hour primarily because of the language barrier.\
  \ Every few steps we would stop and play a game with our words, him passing me the\
  \ initial explanation and then me asking questions; repeating things in different\
  \ ways and a good deal of guessing would eventually lead to us having some sort\
  \ of understanding.\n\nThe other reason our hike took longer was the thunderstorm.\n\
  \nOnce we got to the midpoint of the hike, all hopes of seeing any animals were\
  \ dashed when it began to rain. And when I say rain, I mean jungle rain. I mean\
  \ torrential downpour. I mean that even in my waterproof trousers and poncho I had\
  \ no hope of keeping dry, so I ditched the poncho and took a shower. \n\nAnd all\
  \ the while, behind our backs, the jungle was undergoing a sort of metamorphosis.\
  \ Branches fell, streams turned into rivers, and puddles became lakes until the\
  \ jungle had become more swamp than anything else. Like a Rubik\u2019s cube with\
  \ different sections swirling around each other. But no, a Rubik's cube is not the\
  \ right metaphor. Instead, the rainforest is more like a serpent emerging from its\
  \ long sleep, lazily stretching out inside its skin as it uncoils to rise up slowly\
  \ to meet the charmer\u2019s flute of the rainfall, before flinging its skin off\
  \ entirely and becoming something wholly unknown. The jungle had changed. If there\
  \ had been any semblance of a path on the way in, it was now no more. \n\nI should\
  \ probably mention at this point that setting foot in the Amazon rainforest has\
  \ been a lifelong dream of mine. I grew up in awe of the planet and of Pachamama\
  \ (Incan Mother Earth Deity). The Amazon, with all of its luscious diversity and\
  \ vastness, seemed to me where Pachamama is at her most powerful. Something which\
  \ I didn\u2019t really understand until then.\n\nWe made our way back at a much\
  \ slower pace. We now needed to wade, and even swim at points, through the swamp\
  \ which the jungle had become around us. Communication began to transcend the language\
  \ barrier as we clambered over vines and swam through rivers which had grown and\
  \ swelled at an alarming rate whilst we were caught unawares. \n\nBut I was also\
  \ in awe. I don\u2019t think anything other than awe would be the right word. I\
  \ felt tiny and overwhelmed by the power of the rainforest, recognising nothing\
  \ of our route once we turned back around. I was surrounded by it and I could feel\
  \ how alive it all was. My lifelong fascination with the Amazon was finally being\
  \ realised; as we wandered, jumped and swam back to the lodge, I finally understood\
  \ how wild and fertile and unpredictable she was, alive with insects and animals\
  \ and plants I will never be able to learn all the names of."
