Text: "*click* and our trip was booked.\n\nIt took one discounted Facebook post, one\
  \ three day weekend and $3000 dollars later and we were set to explore the Viking\
  \ home land of Iceland. \n\nShort tips I learned before and during my discovery\
  \ of this fridged country was that, it's possible to explore by car within 24 hours.\
  \ Keep in mind thats if you don't stop to take in Iceland's vast landscapes. Which\
  \ it's hard to keep your eyes on the road since Iceland has three volcanoes on this\
  \ island. \n\nThe size of Iceland is small and doable in a week. The amount of hot\
  \ springs, volcanoes and glacers you'll find here is worth your time and money well\
  \ spent. However since it's not a \"cheap\" country expect your average meal here\
  \ for two to be around $60 US dollars ( burger and a sandwich).  The plus side to\
  \ this expensive country is that Icelanders dont expect or sometimes won't accept\
  \ tips, which saves you some extra pocket change. \n\nI reccomend Airbnbs for your\
  \ stay as you get to see for yourselves how the locals live and chat with their\
  \ family about heritage and learn first hand on what it's like to live in a country\
  \ that only has summer for two months, which wont get passed 70 degrees. \n\nOur\
  \ trip was merely by chance, a bright bold sign which read \"discounted flights\
  \ to Iceland\" and I was left with memories I'll cherish for a lifetime."
