Text: "Developing personally and professionally while traveling and studying abroad.\
  \ Not the results I would have thought about as a young child, growing up in a small\
  \ town in upstate New York. Growing up, I was generally very introverted and focused,\
  \ and not to brag, but generally at the top of my class. The product of a divorced\
  \ parenthood, my stepfather and mother were PhD-level educated, with constant teachings\
  \ and sometimes strict scoldings that reminded me to read constantly, question everything,\
  \ explore alternative perspectives, and interact with others who have alternative\
  \ points of view. My father worked in supply-side manufacturing, always reinforcing\
  \ the importance of hard work. \n\nIn 1995, at 10 years of age, I was given the\
  \ opportunity to travel with my parents to China, Japan, and Hong Kong. This was\
  \ my first global travel experience. It opened my eyes to a world of culture, language,\
  \ food, music, style that were very different from the small town I was accustomed\
  \ to inhabiting. Later, I started studying Romance Languages, and expanded my travel\
  \ exposure in Western Europe. \n\nWhile still very focused and career-driven, my\
  \ career aspirations started to include language and travel--whatever I worked on,\
  \ had to have a global component. Mostly, I was focused on French. From my very\
  \ first exposure at 4 years of age in ballet class, I loved the sound, the culture,\
  \ the food, the music, everything that was related to French language and culture.\
  \ \n\nWhen I started working after graduating from years of schooling, I was tasked\
  \ with creating a professional development plan for myself, which included focusing\
  \ on skill sets I wanted to develop (analytics, conflict management, leadership,\
  \ etc.), and also highlighting traits that enabled me to be effective, to be my\
  \ best self at work. \n\nWhere did those traits come from? In the age-old nature\
  \ vs. nurture question, I realized that I had developed or sharpened many traits\
  \ during my travels abroad: self-reliance, mental toughness, openness to other points\
  \ of view, creative thinking (exploring alternative methods to resolve a challenge),\
  \ social analytical skills--as I strove to understand what was going on around me.\
  \ All of these were traits I had to dig deep and find within myself as I faced challenges,\
  \ and worked through challenges, including language barriers and humorous miscommunications\
  \ that occurred while studying abroad. I carried all these traits with me into adulthood\
  \ and professional life, which positively impacted and influenced my work life.\
  \ Relationships arose or fell apart, based on the development of these traits within\
  \ myself. \n\nFrom my first global exposure at 10 years of age in China, to my most\
  \ recent visit to Paris, France, each travel experience forces me to think on my\
  \ feet, to be flexible and considerate, to work through language barriers, to consider\
  \ alternative points of view, alternative perspectives, so that I can thoroughly\
  \ enjoy and experience the place I'm visiting, and more importantly, learn more\
  \ about myself though each experience."
