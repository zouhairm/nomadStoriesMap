Text: "\"Omusongo\", the pleasant daily greeting at the matatu station, as I embarked\
  \ upon my journey.  Three hours, despite the flapping chicken under my seat of the\
  \ Nissan matatu minibus, allowed me to read the local newspaper. \n\nToday was the\
  \ only day when the tea trucks connect the interior mud roads - impassable once\
  \ the equatorial rains come every afternoon in the fertile Kisii highlands. I grabbed\
  \ onto the ladder off the back of the first truck, stuffed with Kenyan tea leaves.\
  \ \n\nSlightly embarrassed by my nation's coloniser heritage, I\u2019m told that\
  \ I'm the first white person, outsider, or literally \"wanderer\" - \"Omusungo\"\
  \ in the local Ekegusii dialect, or \"Mzungu\" in Kiswahili - passing by here since\
  \ the 1950s.\n\nI finally made it. Mr Omburi was waiting for me at the gate. His\
  \ stance was official, belly rounded over his suit trousers, and white shirt pulled\
  \ taught over it.  He, disappointedly, shook my hand and welcomed me through the\
  \ gate, shutting it behind me after he realised that I'd come alone. \n\nWe entered\
  \ his office, which appeared like a shell+core brick barn, with an imposing wooden\
  \ desk angled to the right hand side of the vast, empty unit.  The building had\
  \ wooden gables below the tin roof.  I looked up at the rafters as I took a seat.\
  \  African hornets, with their big, black, fat bulbous tail and weaponry sting,\
  \ buzzed around their nest.  But it\u2019s fine, I thought, they\u2019re way up\
  \ high in the rafters above.\n\nMr Omburi cut the pleasantries and got straight\
  \ down to business, with no offer of chai and mandazi. \"We very much need your\
  \ investment\", he said sternly. \"The government funds don't flow down to us\"\
  .  \u201CWe\u2019re too remote, and we\u2019re not Kikuyu\u201D.  Kenya\u2019s incumbent\
  \ president is from the Kikuyu tribe, as is Barak Obama\u2019s Kenyan father.\n\n\
  I smiled and nodded, listening intently, with one eye looking up into the rafters.\
  \ \u201CWhat're those hornets up to\", I wondered.  It was unnerving sitting below\
  \ them, despite the great height between us. \n\nAnd suddenly, plop. \n\nI wish\
  \ I had fastened my top collar, I cursed myself; slightly resembling a school teacher\
  \ in my conscious efforts to cover my skin in this traditional Evangelical community,\
  \ sporting a white shirt, collar open in the afternoon heat, and a full length skirt,\
  \ with my toes peeking out of the bottom through my \u201Caction sandals\u201D.\
  \  My long hair tied back in a pony tail, out of the way.  \n\nSomething crashed\
  \ down through the gaping opening in the back of my shirt collar.  Oh, no, was it\
  \ a hornet? What do I do now?  Did he see it?\n\nHe continued talking at me.  I\
  \ discretely smacked my back where the impact zone was. I patted myself on my back,\
  \ hard, with my arm across my front reaching over my shoulder.  \n\nI wanted to\
  \ rip my shirt open and throw it off, to scream, yank all my buttons open at once,\
  \ and run around the room like a headless chicken in my bra.  Damn it, why can\u2019\
  t I be one of those extroverted people?  Why do I have to think he\u2019ll think\
  \ I\u2019m hysterical, or worse, be branded as a witch or possessed with demons?\
  \  Mrs Nyanza, named after the province, in the village had warned me about witchcraft,\
  \ with dire consequences.  So I just discretely patted myself on the back again.\
  \    \n\nIt moved.  Oh God, it moved.  I felt it wriggle diagonally under my shirt.\n\
  \nPat. Then it stopped moving. I left my hand there, over my shoulder.  Am I brave\
  \ enough to let go?\n\nA few seconds passed, which felt like an age in the uncertainty.\n\
  \nI nervously took my hand away.  No movement. I pulsated on my shirt sleeve, pulling\
  \ from the top to tease it down the inside sleeve. With my arm facing the floor,\
  \ gravity helped ease it down.  Another jiggle, and it was at my cuff. \n\nOne final\
  \ twitch, and a gecko fell to the floor.  Lifeless. Fractured. Squished.  \n\nI\
  \ can\u2019t think of anything more witch-like than dead newts crawling from me.\
  \  But even if he did notice, he continued until the afternoon rains hammered down\
  \ on the tin roof. And the hornets kept buzzing in the sheltered rafters above."
