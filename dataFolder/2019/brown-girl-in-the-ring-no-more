Text: "Cacooned in a small island nation in the middle of the Indian Ocean was a black\
  \ haired brown teenage girl afraid to step outside of her comfort zone. She never\
  \ thought she would ever travel solo, but she did. It changed her life forever.\n\
  \           My story begins when I decided to apply for a short scholarship programme\
  \ in Thailand from my University. To my surprise I was the only student accepted\
  \ from Sri Lanka. The first thought that crossed my mind in that moment was an explicit\
  \ word. I had never travelled abroad at that point. The thought of travelling abroad\
  \ for the first time all by myself with little time to mentally prepare overwhelmed\
  \ me to the point of anxiety. I had no choice but to pack my fears along with my\
  \ bags. The day had arrived and as I stepped into the unknown, I decided I was going\
  \ to embrace this opportunity. Little did I know that it would go on to shape my\
  \ life and purpose forever. \n         The whole journey was an adventure in itself\
  \ as I had to figure things out along the way all by myself from the word go. I\
  \ learnt that most people are kind if I was humble enough to ask for help. I learnt\
  \ that the game of Cherades was in fact a universal language and a great form of\
  \ communication. I learnt that GPS and WiFi were my immediate best friends. Never\
  \ had I felt so small yet so full at the same time. My world as I knew it to be\
  \ had changed. All in all I discovered a new me. Most importantly I realized I would\
  \ do it all over again for the love of people, culture, adventure and self discovery\
  \ in the blink of an eye.\nWe fear the things of this world that could consume us,\
  \ not knowing that those very same things will bring us new life."
