Text: "'I didn't expect to find'\nOne day when I am at office, it was about 17:00.\
  \  I was already finish my duties for that day, so I decided to search various websites\
  \ in order to learn new things that continue worldwide.\n In professional, I am\
  \ a journalist but I manage health desk. So, when I proceeded to look some websites,\
  \ I got surprise to meet with headline written that \u2018Ready to take your travel\
  \ writing to the next level? I answered myself I\u2019m ready.\nYou know why? I\
  \ didn\u2019t expect to find that question which relate with trip to Portugal because\
  \ I love traveling and always I meet with new people and friends when I am in trip.\n\
  Also, that question made me to remember the day I traveled from Dar es Salaam, Tanzania\
  \ to Nairobi Kenya, last year. \nIt was amazing trip for me, because I met with\
  \ many journalists from several countries in Africa. I didn\u2019t expect to find\
  \ them in my profession because a lot of time I used to edit stories of my fellow\
  \ journalists in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania.\nIn that trip, I used 1.30 hour fright\
  \ from Dar es Salaam to Nairobi. I felt well and enjoyed enough, because I take\
  \ a lot of time to stay newsroom to edit stories because I am an editor. \nThat\
  \ trip it was about media management training; I stayed Nairobi in three days; two\
  \ for training and one for visit some areas which I adored with my fellows.  \n\
  Every area which we went, it was a new for me. But I enjoyed food, drinks and gym.\
  \ Although we used one day to go various areas after training in two days but was\
  \ amazing trip.\nBut that it was a good way for me to do many things because until\
  \ now, because when I met with new journalists in Nairobi, we joined to be friends;\
  \ even now we still to communicate and share things in order to make our mind to\
  \ grow. \nSurely I didn\u2019t expect to find new friends; while we were out for\
  \ visit, we shared some experience things about our nations."
