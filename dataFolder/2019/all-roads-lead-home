Text: "\u201C A part of me has died today and I cannot mourn. Because I\u2019ve forgotten\
  \ all the synonyms of sadness\u201D. \u2013 says the lead character in the opening\
  \ of Xavier Dolan\u2019s movie, \u201CTom at the Farm\u201D. He was mourning his\
  \ departed lover. At the evening of a cold January, my thoughts were more or less\
  \ the same, except I wasn\u2019t mourning a lover. \nCrying on the shoulders of\
  \ my sleeping friend was something I did on a bus full of people, but nobody saw\
  \ me. Every time I wanted to stop crying and decide to sleep instead, I cried even\
  \ more.\nI had never been to Macedonia before, had not known a lot about the place\
  \ either, except Alexander the Great. I should have been more excited for the things\
  \ awaiting us, for the places I had never step foot into, for the language I had\
  \ never heard before. The hollow in my heart didn\u2019t allow me to feel anything\
  \ but agony.  \nOhrid was smelling like burning wood and it was icy cold. We asked\
  \ a woman walking with her children  how to find the Pitu Guli street, and without\
  \ hesitating she started to guide us through some direction that we assumed was\
  \ the one we were looking for. Once we reached our destination, she said something\
  \ in Macedonian, we said something back in English,  and neither of us understood\
  \ each other. She smiled at us and we smiled back.\nThe owner of the hostel was\
  \ a middle aged man. He showed us our room, explained how the hot water worked,\
  \ told us not to turn off the heater when we leave the room because it will be cold\
  \ when we get back and gave us a plate of Turkish delight as a welcoming present.\
  \ Thanks to the kindness of two strangers my heavy heart lightened a little that\
  \ night.\nMorning was not as cold as the night and we took a tour to the city centre.\
  \ Surrounded by mountains, seagulls flying over, Lake Ohrid looked glorious. It\
  \ was the nicest shade of blue with little boats floating on. There were statues\
  \ of historical figures across the shore, looked like the guardians of the lake.\
  \ I saw a dog with one ear missing, followed her around for the whole afternoon.\
  \ We took lots of pictures, and I sent one with me cuddling the dog to my sister.\
  \ She immediately replied that they loved it a lot, and when I got home few weeks\
  \ later, found the picture sitting on top of the piano in the living room, printed\
  \ out and framed nicely. I find myself pretty in that photo, which is something\
  \ I rarely do. Perhaps happiness does look good on everyone.\nLater on we went up\
  \ to Kaneo, a cliff overlooking the Lake Ohrid, with an Orthodox church behind.\
  \ A Turkish couple were sitting at the bench and drawing, there were sounds rising\
  \ up from the church. At one point the sounds stopped. It was probably the unreal\
  \ beauty of the scenery made me feel suddenly so small and desperately crave a faith\
  \ in something, anything. I remember telling my friend, \u201CIf God really exists,\
  \ he must live  somewhere here\u201D. He didn\u2019t acknowledged me at all, I guess\
  \ he was also enthralled himself. A song came to my mind: \u201CI need serenity,\
  \ in a place where I can hide\u201D. It was a moment of total tranquillity.\nThere\u2019\
  s a video of me and my friends in a car that we had hitch-hiked. Bopping our heads\
  \ to some rap song on the radio, one might think that we were having the time of\
  \ our lives. In fact, that day we got denied of entrance to Kosovo at the border,\
  \ had no place to sleep and no idea what will happen next. When I think of best\
  \ memories in my life, this goes on the top 5, without any doubt. \nLeaving Leicester\
  \ for good was scary, it was the first place I could call home after all. But I\
  \ don\u2019t mind saying goodbyes now, since I realised that home has never been\
  \ a destination. The roads are home on their own, since they all lead there at the\
  \ end."
