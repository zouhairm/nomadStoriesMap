Text: "Two years ago from this date, it would not have crossed my mind to look up\
  \ the town of Glenside, PA. Things have changed since then, and now that I am married\
  \ to a Glenside boy, not only have I looked it up, but also travelled to and stayed\
  \ there. A small suburban town on the east coast, located north of the bustling\
  \ city of Philadelphia, Glenside is part of both the Abington and Cheltenham townships,\
  \ in Montgomery County of the state of Pennsylvania.\n\nLush and verdant at summertime\
  \ when I was visiting, the skies lazuline and magnanimous, and clouds floating by\
  \ leisurely like the shock of white on an old man\u2019s head, Glenside was beautiful.\
  \ The streets and houses were pretty as a picture postcard, gold-plated with sunshine.\
  \ An amateur birdwatcher, my first few weeks in the town also served as an essential\
  \ introduction to some of the Birds of America: the magnificent blue jay, the bright\
  \ shock of red that is the cardinal, the ubiquitous orange-breasted robin, the fluffy\
  \ little yellow oriole, and the whitish-grey mockingbirds, pottering around the\
  \ bright green manicured lawns, and hopping about on the piles of freshly-laid mulch.\
  \ Big fat squirrels and wild furry rabbits had the run of the land, sometimes peeking\
  \ out of the blossoming bushes of hydrangeas, the lovely pink and blue heads of\
  \ the latter swaying in the gentle breeze, a serene but riotous profusion of beauty.\
  \ Evenings there in the summer dispelled the notion that it must get dark after\
  \ six; there would be light almost until nine. But towards the end of evening, Glenside\
  \ would become surreal, iridescent, a thing of memory, lambent in the rose-coloured\
  \ light of summer sunsets.\n\nA few minutes\u2019 walk from the Glenside train station,\
  \ a route that I can now tread upon at will in my mind, was a two-storeyed grey\
  \ house with white windows, and a sprawling old oak tree in the backyard. Coming\
  \ around the corner, I always spotted the oak tree first, its branches Atlas-like\
  \ holding up the vast dark blue sky, streaks of it bleeding into the earth at twilight.\
  \ Those branches, limned with a light green moss, bent slightly inwards upon the\
  \ house as if in a protective half-embrace. The sound of the oak leaves rustling\
  \ in the wind, sometimes like the sound of pouring rain, and at other times like\
  \ the sea rushing in hungrily to meet the shore, stood out in the silence that often\
  \ pervaded Glenside. It was a kind of silence that seemed deafening during my first\
  \ two weeks there, as if my ears would explode in this intense loudness of quietude,\
  \ as if there weren\u2019t any people around, or they knew how to keep themselves\
  \ absolutely still. Slowly, as we walked towards it, the deck of the grey house\
  \ would appear in the line of our vision. Seeing the house lights switched on, my\
  \ husband and I would know that Mom and Dad were back from work (Mom is a school\
  \ teacher and Dad a physiotherapist, two of the hardest working people I have ever\
  \ met). That would mean sitting down to dinner together, probably out on the deck,\
  \ the leaves of the oak tree spread out against the sky in the shape of small star-like\
  \ dark green asterisks, reminding us of the tree, something far larger and older\
  \ than any of us sitting at the table. We would tell them about the sights we had\
  \ seen that day, the places we had been to, and the people we had met, and show\
  \ them the photographs which we had taken, including embarrassing couple selfies.\
  \ My husband\u2019s family loves to tell stories, the incidents and people in their\
  \ lives transformed into tales that never fail to bring forth good-natured laughter.\
  \ At dinner, I listened to those stories with rapt attention, absorbing them, memorizing\
  \ each detail, telling myself that these were my stories too, as was this family\
  \ that I was a part of now."
