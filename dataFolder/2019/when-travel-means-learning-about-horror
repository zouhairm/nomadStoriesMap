Text: "I was travelling for the last month. For the very first time of my life, I\
  \ had the time. The time to take the time. The time to meet new people, to be confronted\
  \ to new realities. I have just been quitting a great career as a title attorney\
  \ to study tourism and... write stories.\n\nI spent one month in Bali (hello Eat,\
  \ Pray, Love), some days in Singapour... and then, I arrived to Cambodia. What a\
  \ shock. What do we know about Cambodia? Not a lot. We know about the famous Angkor\
  \ temples. Maybe, we know a little bit about poverty, or about pollution... I knew\
  \ about Pol Pot and the communist regime of the \"khmer rouges\", but not much.\
  \ The horrors of genocides are so far from us, North Americans. We live in the American\
  \ dream, we are lucky to live in peace. We have the opportunity to say what we want,\
  \ when we want, as long as it is done with respect. \n\nBut in Cambodia, there was\
  \ a time when it was not like this (and still I will no pretend that people there\
  \ can now express themselves as here in America). A time, not far from now. From\
  \ 1975 through 1979, the country was governed by terror. In Phnom Pen, I visited\
  \ sadly renowned S-21 Prison and the Killing Fields. In those places, you can learn,\
  \ by listening to very good audioguides, an horror story. When a part of the people\
  \ of a country, tortured a bunch of other of them, for no (good) reasons. They got\
  \ them out of their houses, their jobs, their cities, their families. The reason?\
  \ They were educated. These people were teachers, attorneys (!), doctors, ... These\
  \ people had to renounce to everything they had. And their tormentors were other\
  \ Cambodians. How can a regime like this happens? Still, I do not understand.\n\n\
  If you go to Cambodia, in the capital city Phnom Penh, please to visit those sites\
  \ and do take the audioguides. I don't want to tell you too many details. But if\
  \ you are a little bit sensible, you are going to cry. Maybe, be a little be nauseous.\
  \ It is also possible that once or twice, you just stop listening, because it is\
  \ too much to take at once. But at the end of your day, you will be grateful. Grateful\
  \ for your life. And more tolerant.\n\nAnd you will see very poor people in this\
  \ country. Little bit of a chaos, sometimes. But, there is so much light into it.\
  \ In the smiles of the people, with their tumultuous history. The light upon the\
  \ big Tonle Sap lake or with the sun rising behind Angkor Wat temple will touch\
  \ you even more.\n\nBecause sometimes, travelling is not just about beauty, good\
  \ food, fun, great pictures and meaningful new meetings. It can be about learning\
  \ about the planet, find the unexpected, for the good... and for the worst. To learn\
  \ more about tolerance. To cry. To be shocked. And to change, a little bit, I hope,\
  \ and to become a better human being. After visiting Cambodia, I thought a bit about\
  \ Donald Trump. I thought also about all racist people of the world. Some people,\
  \ instead of taking selfies should visit meaningful places, that are not easy to\
  \ visit. It is not always just about vacation and fun. It is about all the meaning\
  \ of traveling."
