Text: "The luggage belt jerked into motion. From the corner of my eye I spotted them.\
  \ A lurid orange twist of Thai monks waiting. Waiting for what? Bags of robes?\n\
  \nI was in Chiang Mai and over the next week I would see the cloaked men wherever\
  \ I went. I spotted a monk drawing cash from an ATM; and on a particularly hot day,\
  \ I saw one of the devout men slurping a Seven-Eleven iced tea. With each fleeting\
  \ encounter more questions came up. I tried to store them in my mind. File them\
  \ in order of importance. You see, I was going to meet a monk.\n\nWat Chedi Luang\
  \ is in the centre of the Old City of Chiang Mai. It is where monks hang about to\
  \ meet foreigners and 'chat', so that they may practice their English. On arrival,\
  \ I saw the sign: \u201CMonk Chat. Welcome to Monk Chat Program. Drop in to chat\
  \ about Monk\u2019s Life, Buddhism, Thai culture and anything. Don\u2019t just stand\
  \ looking from afar and walk away.\u201D\n\nA small monk, sitting at a table, gestured\
  \ that I join him. I took a seat, his fingers were gathered in a loose heap on the\
  \ table alongside a brown sling bag. He never asked my name and I never asked his.\
  \ The first words between us came from him, \u201CWhere are you from?\u201D\n\n\
  He repeated my answer, \u201CCape Town\u201D. He search his brain for references.\
  \ He knew that it was a peninsula and that it was where Nelson Mandela once lived.\
  \ At times he searched for the right word. His mouth already open, lips all set,\
  \ but he\u2019d wait until the best one came and then carefully spill it out in\
  \ a tone that was just above a whisper. The delicate connection forming between\
  \ us kept being pierced by a conversation two tables away.\n\nI didn\u2019t want\
  \ to insult him with its trivialness, but he came to a pause, and... \u201CCan monks\
  \ own dogs?\u201D, I asked. He seemed to like the question. The dogs that live at\
  \ the temples are brought there. The monks take care of them and feed them. He smiled\
  \ when telling me that temple dogs never bark, they\u2019re quiet and silently observe\
  \ the monks\u2019 chanting and meditating.\n\nI asked him about his family. Is he\
  \ able to visit them? Yes, but for no longer than seven days at a time. Any longer\
  \ than that, and he has to stay at a monastery close by and drop in to visit them.\
  \ \u201CI can\u2019t hug my sister.\u201D He added out of nowhere. I knew that monks\
  \ were not allowed to touch females, but I\u2019d never thought about the rule applying\
  \ to family. I wanted to know if the same applied to his mother, but I couldn\u2019\
  t bring myself to ask him.\n\nHe went on to explain the other rules of being a monk\
  \ that accompanied celibacy. Some monks fall off the wagon. He believes that when\
  \ you choose to stray, it\u2019s you. There\u2019s something in you that doesn\u2019\
  t want to be a monk. I like that. No scapegoat, no sign of some evil force with\
  \ a goatee and a pitchfork poking you towards corruption or crime. \n\nOnce or twice,\
  \ in a response he would use the wrong tense, or forget to add the \u2018s\u2019\
  \ to make the noun a plural, but in the same breath he would correct himself. \u201C\
  Buddhism isn\u2019t a religion. It is the teach \u2013 teaching \u2013 of the Buddha\
  \ which is followed to lead a life of peace.\u201D \n\nHe has decided to be a monk\
  \ forever. So far 15, years.\n\nI wish I was so sure of anything. He said that being\
  \ a monk allows him the opportunity to be at peace. He said that it\u2019s impossible\
  \ for a person with a regular job and a normal life to be fully aware. Work and\
  \ traffic, alcohol and bills. Distractions that get between us and peace.\n\nI had\
  \ to go. It was time to return the bike. They had my passport, the place closed\
  \ at six and I needed to be on a plane the next morning. As I waved goodbye, I envied\
  \ his life. One of less 'stuff' and more peace."
