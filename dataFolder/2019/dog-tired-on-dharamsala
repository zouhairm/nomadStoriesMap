Text: "\"I know I am not going to die on the pass tomorrow, Dog,  but it sure feels\
  \ like it. \"  \n     Back in Nepal in a tent after almost 20 years, this is what\
  \ trekking again at 48 felt like.  In the middle of my sleepless night, waiting\
  \ for the 0330 start time to go over the 5125 meter Larkya La pass, I was talking\
  \ to a little  white dog. And also wondering if he was real. \n \n      My brother\
  \ and I had returned to this country for a variety of reasons- my main one being\
  \ curiosity about how Nepal had recovered after a series of unfortunate events:\
  \ including the 2015 earthquake whose epicenter was near where we were currently\
  \ hiking and which had claimed over 9,000 lives. Our guide and porter were from\
  \ the region hardest hit. \n \n          The last time we had been here we had finished\
  \ our trek to Gokyo without knowing who had become our new president. Imagine the\
  \ difficulty of trying to explain how the electoral college worked, what hanging\
  \ chads were, and not knowing 2 weeks post election night who our pre 9/11 president\
  \ was.   While on that trek, Nepal was experiencing her own year 2000 democratic\
  \ growing pains.\n      Maoist insurgents raided a police checkpoint a few kilometers\
  \ away from where we slept one night,  killing two soldiers.     We saw boulders\
  \ painted with leftover Maoist \"Vote for\" in English followed by the symbol of\
  \ a tree- markings from 1994 elections. Apparently the Maoists were mad as hell\
  \ at not getting seats in Parliament and were not going to take it anymore.   My\
  \ brother and I had descended in a tiny plane from Lukla back to Thamel and watched\
  \  angry W and Gore supporters on CNN.  One day later, I saw a Kathmandu square\
  \ filled with riot police and Maoist protesters. \n          Twenty years later,\
  \ with an altitude headache, a cold and diarrhea- I considered how we were all doing.\
  \ \n        Our 23 year old guide Nabin's home had been destroyed in the earthquake.\
  \ His family moved to the Terai (low country) and were saving slowly to rebuild\
  \ their home.  Villages along our 21 day trek were still being rebuilt. We visited\
  \ a brand new clinic attached to the Leru Monastery in the Tsum Valley-  it was\
  \ managed single handedly by a female Sherpa nurse.  Porters 20 years later were\
  \ consistently wearing shoes rather than plastic flip flops. Our porter Begg was\
  \ earning money to go to engineering school despite a disability- he had been blinded\
  \ in one eye as a child. The average annual household income in Nepal was $1,000.\
  \      Things fell apart- things were also slowly being rebuilt. Nothing easily.\n\
  \          I thought about this as my head throbbed and nose ran,  and at some point\
  \ in the middle of the night,  a small dog had joined me.  Together, we regarded\
  \ the starry Himalayan sky for a few very long cold hours.   \n         I woke my\
  \ brother up-  he worked as a ski patrol director in Summit County, Colorado.\n\
  \           \"There is a dog in our tent,\" I informed him in the dark- hoping it\
  \ was not hypoxia.  We were a days walk from any villages. It made absolutely no\
  \ sense that a tiny poufy dog would be here.\n          He sat up, concerned.  I\
  \ shined my flashlight into the corner. \n              Jon looked relieved.  \n\
  \              \"I thought you were hallucinating\" he said.  \n \n        The dog\
  \ kept Jon and I  company until Nabin greeted us with morning tea for the climb.\
  \  We looked at the dog, comfortably curled up in the tent, and I suddenly remembered\
  \ a question my brother had once asked my grandfather when he was a kid. \n    \
  \        \"Grampy,  do you think they'll remember me?\" he had asked as they entered\
  \ Mrs. Foster\u2019s Donut Shop, which they visited together just once a year. \
  \ \n             Head thumping and nose running, I turned on my headlamp and my\
  \ brother and I began our long walk, leaving those memories and questions in the\
  \ tent with the little white Nepali dog."
