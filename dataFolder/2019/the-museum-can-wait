Text: "It was not a random travel book in a hotel lobby, or a specific photo of a\
  \ blue-tiled building that captivated my interest in Lisbon. It was indeed, like\
  \ most of my visits, conjured up by flickering images and sounds within my memory.\
  \ A passion for Fado music, postcards of Portuguese fishermen, or snapshots of elegantly\
  \ dressed old lovers dangling off vintage balconies. But the traveler, a natural-born\
  \ wanderlust, is not only guided by passion, familiarity, and esthetic, the traveler\
  \ is above all else lured by an invisible voice that calls on him to visit a specific\
  \ place- and for some-that voice calls on them to return, again, and again, and\
  \ yet again. \n\nI had arrived in Lisbon on a balmy July night. My stay was in a\
  \ charming Airbnb in the calm yet accessible neighborhood of Rato, a fifteen-minute\
  \ walk from Alfama-Lisbon\u2019s most vibrant area.  I rushed to the supermarket\
  \ to grab a bottle of Prosecco, and a tarta de nata, Lisbon\u2019s most popular\
  \ cream-filled dessert, and as I opened my balcony door just in time to enjoy the\
  \ sunset, my attention was redirected to a white pony parked in the courtyard of\
  \ small kindergarten across the street.  The ease with which I settled into the\
  \ city, and the magic of the scenery that lay before me, hinted at what would become\
  \ one of my best trips to date.\n\nIn the room next to me was a German woman 20\
  \ years my senior. Her style of travel was as random and whimsical as mine, and\
  \ if any city inspired this kind of carelessness-it was Lisbon. She understood that\
  \ this was a city you savor, preferably with a nice coffee and Pau du Dios (bread\
  \ of God.) At first, she was aloof and stayed only for a few minutes in between\
  \ cigarettes, but eventually we started to talk about our reasons for traveling;\
  \ our reasons for being.\n\nOn the third day I invited her to join me, to which\
  \ she replied, \u201CI\u2019d rather go alone.\u201D But the next morning she had\
  \ changed her mind and decided to tag along. We caught the bus to LX Factory, an\
  \ old gutted thread factory, turned art and restaurant cooperative, perfect for\
  \ the abstract traveler.  After entering a few galleries and pointing at objects\
  \ we would adorn our homes with, we agreed that it was not too early to drink. \
  \ The woman who seemed weary of me, had now become my [traveler] in crime, one who\
  \ believed in letting go, and letting one moment guide you to the next.\n\nAs we\
  \ approached la Torre De Bel\xE9m, a small yet intricate tower built on the Tagus\
  \ river, we sighed at the queue in front of us, but to the right there was a shallow\
  \ beach with a few children playing nearby, so I smiled at Julia and said, \u201C\
  Would you like to put your feet in the water and imagine what it looks like instead?\u201D\
  -she happily agreed.  With only 2 hours until closing, I asked her if we could take\
  \ a taxi to Bel\xE9m Cultural Center, but she preferred to walk.  I obliged and\
  \ in less than 15 minutes we stumbled upon the entrance of the center, greeted by\
  \ a colorful market set up in the museum\u2019s courtyard. Every first Sunday of\
  \ the month you can get lost in an array of Portuguese cheese, wine, and soap, and\
  \ at the back, the Museu Cole\xE7\xE3o Berardo. But Julia had no interest in entering,\
  \ she preferred a glass of wine and blood-sausage sandwich to enjoy in the front\
  \ garden facing the Tagus. And how could I resist?\n\nThe most unpredictable day\
  \ had turned into my fondest memory of Portugal. The remaining 3 days were spent\
  \ convincing Julia to join me, which she did. In the end, with tears in her eyes\
  \ she confessed: \u201CEllie, you were the best part of my trip\u201D I will never\
  \ forget those words from someone who, like me, prefers to travel on their own terms.\
  \ I returned to Portugal that summer, mostly because I never got to enter the Berardo\
  \ and a few other attractions, but it was fine with me, because Julia was a moment,\
  \ I knew I could never replace."
