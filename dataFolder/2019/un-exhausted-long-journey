Text: "It was a long journey, as a child it was my first long trip I can remember,\
  \ it was 2002 where I was nine years old, I was traveling with my parents who came\
  \ to take me from Ukerewe \u2013 Mwanza where I was living with my grandma to Nkasi\
  \ \u2013 Rukwa to live with them and everything was amazing.\n My journey started\
  \ in the ship, looking at moving trees, rocks, to water which sparkles like silver,\
  \ standing aside the ship while approaching the periphery which seemed closer but\
  \ took long time to reach, looking at flying birds which fly through the sky and\
  \ land on the water and vice versa, without realizing, the journey through water\
  \ reached the end. \nI stepped out of the ship everybody was busy, so was my parents,\
  \ we approached the tax which took us to the guest house, the guest house room was\
  \ bigger than my grandmas\u2019 house, with beautiful curtains and fresh bed covers,\
  \ my mom told me to sleep early as we will wake up early to catch up on the bus\
  \ and we can't afford to miss it.\nWhile I was forcing myself to sleep, I couldn\u2019\
  t. I couldn\u2019t as I was excited, at the same time fear to fail to wake up early.\
  \ Another thing keep me awake was the light, as guest house was inside the Nyegezi\
  \ (Mwanza) bus stand and the bus stand light was lightening inside the room and\
  \ I couldn\u2019t tell if it was midnight or what, it was like the afternoon all\
  \ the time, unknowingly I fall asleep like a second heard my mom wake me up to prepare\
  \ myself.\nAnd after some time we were inside the bus, lightened with a morning\
  \ sun I wake up from my sleep and saw an amazing large plain ground with green grasses,\
  \ later on, I saw moving trees and rocks and likewise.\nFinally, we were in another\
  \ city also populated with people and businesses, my mom held my hand as we were\
  \ disturbed by touts of the bus stand, my dad yelled at them and they stopped bothering\
  \ us. \nWe entered the train stand it was not far from the bus stand, so we walked\
  \ there, we booked the train and we went to the guest house. Unlike Nyegezi bus\
  \ stand the train stand was a little quiet, I stood at the window looking outside\
  \ where there were train heads and other damaged trains packed, I was so excited\
  \ and couldn\u2019t wait to ride the train.\nFinally, the morning was there and\
  \ I was inside the train, it was a very cold morning and there were many people\
  \ running here and there through the windows selling waters in their buckets and\
  \ among them there were kids which were many than older people and among them there\
  \ were others who had the same age as mine and as the train started to leave they\
  \ were chasing it and some passengers were throwing some coins to those who they\
  \ bought the water from.\nWe reached Katavi in the morning and we directly get into\
  \ the bus which was going to Nkasi. Unlike other roads which were just full of grasses,\
  \ trees and others which had rocks, this one had special extra attraction which\
  \ was wild animals and wherever we reached one the whole bus shouted \u201Csee its\
  \ query\u201D \u201Cooh see its elephants\u201D \u201Csee its zebra\u201D, so without\
  \ even asking as it was my first time I said to myself ooh so that\u2019s query,\
  \ wow it\u2019s amazing. \nFinally, the long journey reached its end and my mind\
  \ was rewarding it from the beginning to the end, through all its transportation\
  \ facilities used, It was my first time traveling and first time liking the journey\
  \ and since then if you ask me what among my hobbies I like the most is TRAVELLING."
