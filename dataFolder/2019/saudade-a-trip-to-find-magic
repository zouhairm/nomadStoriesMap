Text: 'My travel story begins telling my journey, where I come from and who I meant
  to be ,how traveling to a place can make us rediscover ourselves and heal "saudade"
  , (a word with no translation in english and recurring theme in Portuguese and Brazilian
  literature wich means when you miss so much, that it hurts and makes you want to
  mourn with sadness because you remember the simplest moments, the most idiotic situations,
  the people ... and you feel out of place, like in a cage, tied up, prisoner, with
  lack of freedom...That feeling is called saudade). So this story is about why destiny
  guided me through another continent to this emblematic country, a source where magic
  has been present at the beginning of great stories such as Harry Potter by JK Rowling
  and also this experience could be the result of a self story tale about life and
  adventure. corners, meals, customs, secrets and people that are part of several
  stories which together will become in a new single narrative creating and showing
  the people that  inspiration blooms from magic experiences and those are the ones
  that lead you to believe in the power of love, friendship and happiness as a result
  how magic can be found in one place: Portugal.'
