Text: "I had the opportunity to visit this amazing country. I went with my best friend\
  \ to find joy and connect with our inner self in a culture totally different than\
  \ the one we grew up, back in the Caribbean. Our trip starts at the cosmopolitan\
  \ capital, Bangkok. First stop was the Wat Pho temple, a place where as soon as\
  \ you walk in, you get immersed with peace; the vibrant colors of the wall coverings,\
  \ golden sculptures inside the temple and distinct architecture already promises\
  \ this country has a lot to offer. We\u2019re hungry and looking for a local place\
  \ to eat... There is music playing and we followed the sound which took us to the\
  \ \u201Clocal place\u201D we were looking for! We sat at the table, the waiter brings\
  \ the menu along with two metal jars filled with ice; he shows us we can put it\
  \ in the forehead and the back of your neck, it was the most refreshing feeling\
  \ I\u2019ve ever felt, after spending the morning walking around the city. We filled\
  \ our table with typical plates to have a taste of their gastronomy. Ooh the food,\
  \ served in handcrafted plates, savory recipes and drinking coconut water from the\
  \ coconut. It was the best on the planet. After that we had a thai massage appointment\
  \ to get to, we took public transportation to get to our hotel and change, instead\
  \ of taking a taxi \u201Cuber\u201D we stood in the streets and waved to call a\
  \ \u201Ctuk tuk\u201D it is a three wheeler motor vehicle that has a built in back\
  \ compartment. It has a U shaped booth seating covered with an awning heavy duty\
  \ fabric, and metal rails; they all have different designs and vivid colors. You\
  \ are in direct contact with the outdoors and your surroundings; you get to enjoy\
  \ the warm breeze, smile and say hi to people along your trip. At our Thai massage\
  \ they give you a set of shirt and pants that looks similar to a karate uniform\
  \ but the fabric is lighter, soft, loose fitting, comfortable, and clean. They take\
  \ you to the room which has a dim light ambience, relaxing music and the mat you\
  \ lay on is in the center of the room on the floor. During the massage, you get\
  \ pulled, stretched and rocked at the hands of your therapist. Most use their elbows,\
  \ knees, and they can even walk on you. It can get a little rough but you can always\
  \ let them know to change the intensity. Afterwards you feel so relaxed and at peace\
  \ with your mind and body. The next day the North part of the country was waiting\
  \ for us, Chiang Mai. This city is mountainous and we planned going to an Elephant\
  \ Sanctuary called \u201CBaan Chang\u201D. One of the most humbling experience you\
  \ can ever be in, the best part is they include you in the Elephants\u2019 routine,\
  \ you get to treat them right. An orientation is conducted at the beginning of how\
  \ Elephants interact, what to expect, how you should behave around them and so your\
  \ adventure begins... During your first encounter with them, you grab a cross body\
  \ bag full of bananas, the Elephant choose who he wants to stay with along the day\
  \ and you start feeding them... They take the banana directly from your hands with\
  \ their trunk, the skin is rough and thick but as soon as you make eye contact you\
  \ get to see how playful and loving they are. The part you\u2019ll enjoy the most\
  \ is taking them to a lake where you get wet and wash them, it\u2019s as if you\u2019\
  re one with them, just amazing, carefree and loving. Last place of our trip took\
  \ place in the southern part of the country, it\u2019s called Phi Phi Island. We\
  \ took an hour boat ride from Phuket. They had private hotels only accessible by\
  \ boat from the main port of entry; they all had bungalows and villas, breathtaking\
  \ views to paradise. At that point we were so grateful and humble to experience\
  \ the country as is, from the places we went to how rich their culture is. Definitely\
  \ a lifetime adventure that enriched our souls!"
