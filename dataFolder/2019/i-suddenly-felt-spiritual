Text: "I was sitting alone on a stone, watching the river flow, not muddy and full\
  \ of plastic, as I had expected all rivers in India to be like when I was back in\
  \ Germany, but clean and with the magic of blue water coming from the mountains,\
  \ coming from the city of Rishikesh. I had left my friends for a while, just wanted\
  \ to enjoy the place, laughter and fun was not compatible with me right now. Several\
  \ pullovers had protected me from the cold in the morning, my limbs were still inflexible,\
  \ my mind a little bit slow and tired, the sunlight still raising upon the mountain\
  \ behind me, when a sadhu dressed in an orange fabric approached, humming with a\
  \ smile and dipping a little kerchief into the water. He must have noticed, that\
  \ I was watching him when he was searching for a place to meditate between the orange\
  \ flowers from a ceremony, which had been washed up. He waved his hand, telling\
  \ me to come over. Luckily, as I had learned some Hindi during the past 5 months\
  \ I was staying in India, I was able to answer his questions. For me it were just\
  \ the same questions all Indians used to ask me, but as there are so many foreigners\
  \ in Rishikesh, it was quite surprising for him, that I was able to answer. Since\
  \ the last 26 years, he told me, he lived here, spending his time watching the river,\
  \ praying and meditating. And then, somewhere out of his loincloth, he took a little\
  \ pipe. The wet kerchief which was still in his hand covered one side, as a filter.\
  \ Although I actually avoid smoking, I took the offer and shared the pipe with him.\
  \ I felt honored to be a part. The harmony, which was in the dreams of so many foreigners\
  \ coming to India and which I was hopeless to find anymore, as I was used to the\
  \ crowded buses, the noise and pollution all around and temples, where red-LED-hearts\
  \ are blinking, somehow started to arise. I remember that when I walk into a church\
  \ I suddenly feel myself becoming religious, although I am actually not. And now,\
  \ when I was sitting at the shore of the Ganga River, I suddenly felt myself spiritual,\
  \ although, I am actually not. Somehow, I was feeling joint, no more as an outsider,\
  \ but as someone who was in harmony, with the sadhu, who was in harmony with himself,\
  \ with the river, with his religion. Somehow I started to imagine a life, next to\
  \ the river, searching for peace and fulfillment of my soul, sharing lots of pipes\
  \ with other sadhus. \nWe had sat for quite some time, when suddenly he broke the\
  \ silence and with one word he destroyed all the harmony, which was settling in\
  \ my mind, rubbing his thumb and middle finger together, he said \u201CPaise\u201D\
  , which means money in Hindi.\nThis was not my dream, this was not my religion and\
  \ I again saw myself as an outsider, an outsider who had learned to communicate,\
  \ but who was still seen as somebody who was coming with money in his pockets. The\
  \ sunlight and my mind had woke up simultaneously. Harmony, maybe it is just a dream,\
  \ nobody will ever be able to find in our system, neither in the cities, where the\
  \ temples are blinking, where noise is all around, nor at the shore of the Ganga\
  \ River. My calm mind, only the effect of cold and tiredness? Even with an abdication\
  \ of home and family, the pipes he smokes want to be filled, want to be paid. I\
  \ felt insulted, was our talk, the same questions all Indians used to ask me, just\
  \ the beginning of a sales conversation? When I walked away, the river had lost\
  \ the magic of blue water and the sadhu, I had smoked with, was only a man with\
  \ too much time."
