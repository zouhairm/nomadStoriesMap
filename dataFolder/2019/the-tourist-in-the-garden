Text: "Botanic gardens have had a changing role throughout history, beginning often\
  \ as medicinal gardens for the study and cultivation of plants with healing properties\
  \ and going through many phases . Although their collections are more or less scientific,\
  \ they are continually adapting and serving the needs of their societies in evolving\
  \ ways as new challenges face those societies.\n\n\n\nThe  Alnwick Garden is one\
  \ of north England's most beautiful attractions, where acres of colorful plants\
  \ invite visitors to wander through rows of fragrant roses, manicured topiaries\
  \ and cascading fountains. But within Alnwick's boundaries, kept behind black iron\
  \ gates, is a place where visitors are explicitly told not to stop and smell the\
  \ flowers: the Poison Garden, home to 100 infamous killers.\n\n\n\nGardens and botanic\
  \ gardens have the same origins in an ideological framework, which includes moral,\
  \ social, aesthetic and economic considerations of the time in which they were created.\
  \ Lately, reflecting the current ethos, botanic gardens have undergone changes,\
  \ becoming part of a bigger design for nature conservation.\n\n\nErich From in his\
  \ book To Be or to Have presents  an abstract of D.T. Suzuki\u2019s 1957 essay \u201C\
  East and West\u201D , one of the more succinct statements contrasting ways of thought\
  \ and observing. To illustrate his point, Suzuki uses a poem of Basho and an equivalent\
  \ poem by Tennyson. Both poets have been impressed by a flower, but as Suzuki notes,\
  \ Basho does not pluck it.\n\n\nEcotourism is now defined as \u201Cresponsible travel\
  \ to natural areas that conserves the environment, sustains the well-being of the\
  \ local people, and involves interpretation and education\u201D (TIES, 2015). Education\
  \ is meant to be inclusive of both staff and guests."
