Text: "Each morning in Cuba I performed a ritual of pretending to like guava. I cut\
  \ the fruit up and shuffled it around the plate, stomached cups of its thick juice\
  \ in quick shots, and gradually perfected four Spanish words: \u2018si, guayaba,\
  \ muy bien\u2019. It was then that Norma asked whether it was true, what she\u2019\
  d heard, that \u201Cthe rest of the world is an economic disaster under capitalism?\u201D\
  \n\nI was sharing a room in Norma\u2019s house in Trinidad\u2014a casa particular\
  \ that she runs with her husband, Delfin. The pair are compassionate, expressive,\
  \ and can answer any question\u2014be it about bus times, directions, or toilet\
  \ paper\u2014with a slideshow of their granddaughters\u2019 quincea\xF1eras. Mobile\
  \ phones only recently became available to Cubans in the past decade, and we frequently\
  \ crowded around a tiny screen to look through photos of their grandchildren and\
  \ great-grandchildren. \n\nIn Trinidad, the past and present seemed to meet on street\
  \ corners: elderly women appeared between bars on windows, selling soap to tourists;\
  \ flat-screen televisions were awkwardly loaded onto horse-drawn carts; and small\
  \ crowds gathered at Wi-Fi hotspots under murals dedicated to the Beatles. I was\
  \ in the city as part of a historical trip and wanted to understand the conflict\
  \ that occurred in the region following the Cuban Revolution. \n\nSo far, my view\
  \ had been somewhat clouded by Ch\xE9 Guevara. His image was inescapable, with revolutionary\
  \ sentiments upheld in countless murals and statues around the country. In museums,\
  \ I had seen Ch\xE9\u2019s yerba mate gourd and metal straw, his boots, his pen,\
  \ his coffin, and even a peach seed with his face carved into it, but I often left\
  \ the exhibits with more questions than answers.\n\nDelfin was open with his experiences.\
  \ Despite scorching temperatures, it was nonetheless winter in the Caribbean, so\
  \ he stepped out in a coat and scarf and we walked to the main plaza together. The\
  \ cobblestoned roads and terracotta tiling were remnants of colonial times, built\
  \ at the peak of the sugar trade during the 18th and 19th centuries. Delfin noted\
  \ that many large buildings were once home to wealthy landowners, and explained\
  \ that prior to the Revolution, a very small percentage of the population owned\
  \ the majority of property. \n\nUnder pastel paintwork, travel agencies showcased\
  \ the waterfalls of the Topes de Collantes, a large nature reserve in the Escambray\
  \ Mountains. Immediately after the 1959 victory of the Cuban Revolution, this mountainous\
  \ region was a base for insurgents rebelling against Fidel Castro\u2019s government.\
  \ Delfin pointed out an old convent in the plaza, which, like many historic edifices,\
  \ had been converted into a national museum. Under large yellow archways, it documented\
  \ Cuban military responses to the Washington-backed counter-revolution and included\
  \ pieces of an American U-2 spy plane which had been shot down. \n\nThe \u2018Struggle\
  \ against Bandits\u2019 continued in the surrounding area until 1965. At the time,\
  \ Delfin was a teen living in Santa Clara. He was distinctly more reserved as he\
  \ described being shot on his way home from school at 16. There is a circular scar\
  \ on his forearm, which he briefly showed me, explaining that he nearly lost the\
  \ entire limb in the incident. Delfin moved to Trinidad with his family shortly\
  \ after, and vividly recounted the distress on people\u2019s faces, the injured\
  \ and deceased lying on the roads. The counter-revolutionary groups, he said, burned\
  \ fields and killed civilians.\n\nAt dinner there was more guava, and although I\
  \ had skirted the morning\u2019s question, Norma was still interested in life in\
  \ capitalist Australia. Neither she nor Delfin had travelled outside of Cuba, however\
  \ they knew about Australia\u2019s off-shore detention centres, the significant\
  \ wealth gap, and poverty. They were visibly shocked to hear that it is nonetheless\
  \ a wealthy country. \n\n\u201CIn Cuba,\u201D Norma said, \u201Cwe look after each\
  \ other.\u201D\n\nNorma and Delfin have lived through periods of immense change,\
  \ from the conflict and upheaval of the revolution and counter-revolution, to the\
  \ trade embargoes and diplomatic sanctions post-revolution. Since Cuba reopened\
  \ to tourism, they have again adapted, inviting foreigners into their home as if\
  \ they were family.\n\nAfter dinner, Delfin poured my half-filled cup of guava juice\
  \ back into the main jug, ready for the next morning."
