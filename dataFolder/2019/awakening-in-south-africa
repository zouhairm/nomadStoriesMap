Text: "When I visited post-apartheid South Africa, I had no idea what to expect. Young\
  \ and naive, I found myself on a plane with a group of classmates I had never met\
  \ before, going to a place I knew I didn't understand. Coming from a predominantly\
  \ caucasian school, this was the first time I was ever, not only the minority, but\
  \ the only white person, anywhere. Little did I know, this would be one of the most\
  \ defining months of my life. \n\nDespite the fact that everyone else already knew\
  \ each other fairly well, I managed to fit into the group rather well. It even became\
  \ a running joke throughout the trip that I must have checked the wrong box or thought\
  \ that South Africa was still predominantly white. During group discussions, one\
  \ student,  Charles, would usually stop and jokingly ask me if I knew the context\
  \ of certain words or understood what was going on. Before getting on the bus, there\
  \ would be a head count and everyone would say \u201Call 15 of us and one white\
  \ girl!\u201D I knew that this was all in good fun, but these situations still made\
  \ me very uncomfortable. But I tried to face that discomfort and forced myself to\
  \ understand the deeper meaning of the conversations we were having about race and\
  \ prejudice. Recognizing that the discomfort I sense, not feeling like I belonged\
  \ in the group, was fleeting for me, yet for these students and so many others,\
  \ it was inescapable. \n\nOne day, we walked through the Apartheid museum and I\
  \ felt an incredible bewilderment as I realized that segregation was legal in South\
  \ Africa until 1994, within my own lifetime.  It was not something I had seriously\
  \ ever had to consider or think about. Abs these classmates of mine still experienced\
  \ such discrimination similarities everyday in America, and I never realized the\
  \ full scope of it. During a food stop I was in line with one of the guys when a\
  \ woman working the register asked him if he was from Niger. Due to the accent,\
  \ it sounded as if she had used a racial epithet, so he naturally had a big reaction.\
  \ Luckily, our tour guide jumped in and cleared up the situation, but the group\
  \ ended up sharing stories of times they experienced that word. In that moment,\
  \ I became very aware of how little I knew about the day to day life of other cultures\
  \ in America. \n\nNot a moment too soon, we arrived at a \u201CShanty Town\u201D\
  , and received a tour through one of the homes. An entire family lived, cooked and\
  \ slept in a room the size of my dorm, yet they still offered us a meal and a smile.\
  \ As we politely declined, the gravity my privilege came over me. A group of kids\
  \ playing with a soccer ball ran to greet us and ask us to play with them, as some\
  \ adults showed us handcrafted knickknacks and paintings. I bought a hand-carved\
  \ chess set for $20. Our tour guide whispered, \u201CI\u2019m sure you can get it\
  \ for half price,\u201D and I wanted to scream.  After standing in this family\u2019\
  s home, how could I possibly buy this gorgeous set that probably took someone days\
  \ to craft for less than $20? \n\nBy the time we arrived at Robben Island, I had\
  \ finished reading a \u201CLong Walk to Freedom\u201D, so the weight of the moment\
  \ really hit me as I sat in silence. Chills ran through me as I stood in Nelson\
  \ Mandela\u2019s prison cell. The walls that confined him closed in on me. All of\
  \ this injustice, simply for fighting for equality, something that every human being\
  \ deserves. It made me realize that when my trip ended and I was right back in the\
  \ middle of my world again, I had to be aware of injustice at every corner. \n\n\
  I couldn\u2019t go back to the lack of awareness I previously had, and more importantly,\
  \ I didn\u2019t want to go back."
