Text: "New Zealand held a mirror up to me and my world. \n\nI sat on a plastic chair\
  \ on uneven ground surrounded by new and old friends, watching the cultural ceremony\
  \ unfolding in front of us. In the dimly lit firelight the Maori\u2019s danced and\
  \ sang with such passion that goosebumps rose across my entire body. Their faces\
  \ were tattooed in a strange traditional ink, but it was their expressions that\
  \ drew our attention. Their tongues stuck out, reaching the bottom of their chins\
  \ as their eyes opened wide in stares intended to terrify. The Haka they performed\
  \ was so loud that it shook the walls and I felt the vibrations of each stamp and\
  \ jump running across the floor and up my legs like pins and needles. I looked briefly\
  \ around the room, wanting to see if others around me were just as impressed with\
  \ the proud and aggressive cultural display in front of them. Most everybody\u2019\
  s eyes were fixed to the performance in awe. I noticed to the left of me a couple\
  \ people talking quietly in excitement, I heard the worlds \u2018amazing\u2019,\
  \ impressive\u2019 and \u2018skilled\u2019 leave their mouths in a distinctive kiwi\
  \ accent. I had noticed a lot in my trip that many New Zealanders from all backgrounds\
  \ came together to learn and support the culture of their Indigenous people, it\
  \ was refreshing. \n\nIn viewing the room surrounding me my mind became flooded\
  \ with thoughts at an alarming pace. I was taken away from the ceremony and temporarily\
  \ transported to the spiralling condition of my mind, \u201CI wonder how despite\
  \ colonialism and the atrocities committed by the invading British how they came\
  \ to be so proud of a culture the once attempted to slaughter? How did this relationship\
  \ form over time and who began the repairs, the government? No, can\u2019t be, at\
  \ home our government seeks actively to portray our indigenous community as dangerous,\
  \ pushing their concerns to the outmost corners of the political sphere. Can allied\
  \ state governments operating in roughly the same socio-economic and political system\
  \ really view their citizens so differently? Guess not. But we had an apology, we\
  \ apologised to the stolen generations, should that not make us acquire the same\
  \ relationship as they have here in New Zealand? I guess an apology is only truly\
  \ an apology if the actions of the apologising people follow through in an apologetic\
  \ manner. Surely the Tasman sea isn\u2019t a big enough divide to prevent us Australians\
  \ from seeing how a cultural mend can be achieved in the land of our cousins, just\
  \ across the way. Or are our eyes blinded to viewing what could be possible because\
  \ the journey to reaching it may be a long and tiring one? No country is perfect,\
  \ and I\u2019m sure the cultural relations in New Zealand are not as perfect as\
  \ they appear to me, but they are better. Shouldn\u2019t we strive for the same?\
  \ Or do we just value of first peoples less than they? Are we just worse people?\
  \ Is racism and inequality a more prevalent issue in our society? Why do we as Australians\
  \ not care enough what happens to our Indigenous people to create change? Can I\
  \ really be proud of my home. My country. No. Their country.\u201D\n\nThe loud roar\
  \ of an appreciative audience brought me back to reality. I joined in applause all\
  \ the while feeling guilty that I temporarily disappeared from the performance caught\
  \ up in my own thoughts. My eyes skimmed the room once more and I smiled. I was\
  \ so glad to have experienced this moment alongside likeminded people, all cheering\
  \ and standing up front their seats one by one in admiration. \n\nThe photos I took,\
  \ the landscapes and the picturesque scenes are the memories I displayed to my friends\
  \ and family back home. And perhaps that\u2019s part of the problem. But the etching\
  \ in my brain of our apparent inadequacy as Australians to recognise inequality\
  \ in a land of first peoples, is the memory I will take with me for the rest of\
  \ my life."
