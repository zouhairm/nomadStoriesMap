Text: "Words cannot describe a feeling. It goes as far as the mind could reach. It\
  \ goes as far as the heart could beat. I heard him tell his friend these words in\
  \ this soft voice. It reminded me of my grandfather who used to share a similar\
  \ sentiment as this young man. My grandfather was a very humble guy, he hated phonies\
  \ and all. In fact he hated everything besides telling stories about this place\
  \ he visited. He told me thousands of them and I figured it out that some were just\
  \ his sense of creativity. He used to tell me about this place in the West. He used\
  \ to call it an island of true believers, the peace makers. The Caribbean as he\
  \ described it, was filled with these beautiful women with dark brown skin and cavicious\
  \ bodies that fascinated every man in the island. Some women were tall, others were\
  \ short and all but what got me fascinated was how he arrived at that place. He\
  \ used to say that his arrival was peculiar. The sea was a bit furious and the ship\
  \ they were in was just a can from the junk yard of ships. It was hired because\
  \ my grandfather felt pity for this guy who owned the ship. He told him that he\
  \ uses the ship to feed his family and all. That\u2019s the thing about my grandfather,\
  \ he would think for others before thinking about himself. He took this ship because\
  \ he wanted to travel to North America. His passion for travel was something that\
  \ my grandmother couldn\u2019t even prevent, poor old lady. The ship sailed West\
  \ from the far West of Africa. For him, it felt good, he felt safe in the sea. His\
  \ vision was to reach America in one peace. The travel was a bit foggy, he did not\
  \ get the directions right because of the weather at sea and also because of the\
  \ can he was traveling with that he later regretted for taking the offer. In this\
  \ journey, as the sea became more and more foggy he began to read the map carefully\
  \ to avoid a bumpy ride. It was of course a long journey, spent nights and days\
  \ at sea. While in the boat, danger approached the ship. It was rough tides that\
  \ ended up forcing the to another direction, and the ship sailed. It went off to\
  \ a very rocky space that cracked the ship in shambles. The ship was now broken,\
  \ it had to be fixed in order to move again. This rocky place that he crashed in\
  \ was welcoming, there was a group of people that approached the ship to see if\
  \ there was no one hurt. Indeed there was no one hurt. These pepole, he started\
  \ calling them dark skinned people started to speak in this funny language, it sounded\
  \ like a language of children. You could hear people speak but you couldn\u2019\
  t hear what they hardly said. Cultures were a bit reserved but one thing that he\
  \ mentioned was that the place was filled with heavy smokers and most people smoked\
  \ marijuana. In a funny way, weed was seen as something important in society, even\
  \ the police smoked it before they could start their shifts. His vision in this\
  \ place was eternal, through his words I could tell that this place placed him in\
  \ between a boarder in his life. He told me that all he could think about was how\
  \ he\u2019d start over. Life is not easy, that\u2019s what he said, but with passion\
  \ everything could move with a better direction. He didn\u2019t say much about my\
  \ grandmother, he knew exactly what he was doing. It was clear that he was indeed\
  \ in the fog until he died last year. He died by a car accident, I find it funny\
  \ how he attempted to avoid accidents in his life. He marked something in life,\
  \ he was not afraid to live. He was not afraid to let his passion carry him far\
  \ and beyond. That is what he taught me."
