Text: "There were hundreds. Hundreds of iridescent bubbles in the air. However, what\
  \ was more astonishing \u2014 there were dozens of smiling faces, dozens of nationalities\
  \ and dozens of raised hands trying to catch the liquid spheres from a fairytale.\
  \ Taking a breath in, I\u2019ve decided to keep this in my mind forever.\n\nTypical\
  \ day of a globetrotter \u2014 all you do is explore the city and people around.\
  \ Strolling down Aker Brygge in Oslo, I heard a lot of kids\u2019 voices filled\
  \ with laugher and immediately headed towards. Instead of taking this hint for granted,\
  \ I started wondering. Free ice cream? You\u2019ve already know I wasn\u2019t that\
  \ lucky.\n\nWhile the road led me, I was intrigued by an initiator of joy. He turned\
  \ out to be a hippie working all day with a special rope to make hippopotamus-size\
  \ bubbles. Not only were the children fascinated but also grownups couldn\u2019\
  t resist traveling in time. I was petrified by the scene that brought the world\
  \ together for a while. The next second I recall myself catching bubbles like in\
  \ a video game for some extra points. \n\nI didn\u2019t expect to find a celebration\
  \ of unity and youth in such a moment. That man did nothing outstanding. He did\
  \ the most rewarding job ever."
