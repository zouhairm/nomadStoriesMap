Text: "It was such a great experience to me. It happened in the last summer which\
  \ was my first time going to abroad. I joined a volunteer program about summer camp.\
  \ I was worried about many things, of course. I had to live in someone's land without\
  \ people I've known. But that's the most challenging part. I love challenge and\
  \ I thought that I had to make it no matter how I tried to. Taiwan is what I am\
  \ talking about. A small-developing country that made me astonished. Travelling\
  \ around Taiwan with friends who came from different part of the world was utterly\
  \ special to me. I never imagined that I could make it which is my big dream to\
  \ travel around the world. I thought it might be my open gate to explore another\
  \ country.\n\nWhen I firstly arrived at Daoyuan International Airport in the midnight,\
  \ I had to stay at the airport because all public transportation don't operate after\
  \ 12 P.M. I stayed and slept at the airport with all my stuff. At the dawn, I took\
  \ a bus and went to Tainan for 5 hours. I was picked up by my Taiwanese mate at\
  \ Tainan bus-stopped station. We were going to NCKU to meet all committees and participants\
  \ who had arrived in NCKU. At the first time we met each others, I didn't feel like\
  \ a stranger. They were very welcome to me.\n\nI spent all my time with my 9 more\
  \ participants from different countries and the local committee. We worked so hard\
  \ to prepare the camp for students. Every time I was stuck with my session, my friends\
  \ always helped me by giving their ideas. We danced and hunted for dinner together.\
  \ Sometimes we went to night market to buy some taiwan traditional cuisine. Fried\
  \ Chicken or they called \"Shillin\" was my cup of tea. I do love it so much. But,\
  \ it was too hard to find spicy food in Taiwan. They don't like spicy cuisine.\n\
  \nAfter our camps have completed, we travelled around from south to north of Taiwan.\
  \ It was my pleasure to discover and explore beautiful places with its interesting\
  \ facts. In the last week, we moved to one city to another city. Making funny video\
  \ of saying hello or good bye when arrived in or left to a city. Even though, the\
  \ weather was too hot in summer, but we enjoyed every single moments we spent together.\
  \ I always remember when we laughed, talked, and shared to each others. However\
  \ we felt worn out, but when we had a talk together, that wouldn't be no more tired.\n\
  \nMany things I learnt during the program, such as sharing own culture and foods,\
  \ giving good impact to students, breaking out of my limits, and many more that\
  \ I cannot mention one by one. I have no words to describe everything that I lived\
  \ yesterday. That's my big reason why I would like to travel to another place. I\
  \ miss my students, my friends and anything that related to the program. My students\
  \ called me \"laoshi\" which means teacher. Even though, I have told them, don't\
  \ call me laoshi. But they still did. That's such an honour for me. \n\nMy one and\
  \ half months of summertime which I spent to find out who I really am and discover\
  \ something new. Time was too short. One and half months were not enough for me.\
  \ I didn't realise that I was falling in love with Taiwan. It was too hard to say\
  \ good bye to each others. I truly hope that we can meet each other in another place\
  \ and in another time. At the end, I brought my new family to Indonesia with all\
  \ sweet memories. Hopefully, someday, I could go back to the place where loves that\
  \ I've got from bunch of friends. Nothing could compare with it. I love you all."
