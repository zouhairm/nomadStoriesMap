Text: "When I was younger always dreamed traveling the world, in my high school I\
  \ worked so hard and got a scholarship to live 5 months in Canada, I was taking\
  \ English class but the program sent me to Quebec, they speak French all the time\
  \ but I didn\u2019t get disappointed, in the beginning it was hard to see other\
  \ others students only speaking French even if I was studying in a Irish school\
  \ in Quebec City. The first month was crazy I didn\u2019t know how to make connections,\
  \ and today I have many Canadians friends, but how I made friends? Well I offered\
  \ gum to them in my math classes, then I asked them \u201CHey, where is the best\
  \ poutine (dish from Quebec)?\u201D they told me where I could buy the delicious\
  \ dish, next week I was talking to them about the new Hunger Games movie, then I\
  \ was going to the movies with them. I didn\u2019t give up anytime, Snapchat helped\
  \ so much, everything was unknown to me, I was a shy teenager and it was easier\
  \ to talk by my networks apps and today I have another dream: travel abroad again\
  \ to see how things works to me, because I think too many times \u201CI could\u2019\
  ve done more things with my friends\u201D, I would like to record about my trip,\
  \ my experience on my Instagram @viagensabordo, and people will learn from me how\
  \ to make friends around the world."
