Text: "Colours that rush to be, nor waits for one moment to get to wherever it seeks\
  \ to stay, and so in passing leaves this trail of booming and vibrant, intense and\
  \ unapologetic hue \u2013 fireworks. In Tenerife children played with fireworks\
  \ on the beach well after their bedtime. Street buskers, well feed strays, clowns\
  \ and magical illusions takes over the night as you order yourself a cup of \u2018\
  Americano\u2019. The familiar that rushes to be, a hint of coffee illicit that waits\
  \ for no one moment to get to wherever it needs, and so flows warm in your veins\
  \ so that as you see even a pop of it, you know that life is there. Yes, one can\
  \ be that passionate about caffeine, but I guess ordering myself an Americano does\
  \ not defend my case. The silver sand between your Christmas festive toes, humidity\
  \ of holidaymakers, children on the playground and kite flyers could spell power\
  \ or perhaps, poverty- no, not that of famine, but I guess you could starve for\
  \ familiarity even in your own home. Rather this is the kind of poverty that\u2019\
  ll go over your head in nooks of comfort, it is the cultural thirst, and things\
  \ as bold as love or war become hard to miss just around the corners it touches.\n\
  \n Being from Australia, Tenerife was nostalgic jingles for Santa in his board-shorts\
  \ and that warm tanning sun. You\u2019ll find yourself on the red sand not so shy\
  \ behind the wave takers in their wetsuits and head up the peak of Montana Roja\
  \ Volcano, a rather darling hiking trail. That is if you opt for the correct footwear,\
  \ I wouldn\u2019t recommend flip flops.  This is where colours decide to begin or\
  \ end it\u2019s relentless, following the path, you can seek out quiet gems that\
  \ you\u2019ll promise yourself to hike to later. Being so close to the peak of the\
  \ Volcano, you\u2019ll feel the colour of being told a secret, the colour of ink\
  \ that had yet dried and unfinished stories. I did this hike in anticipation of\
  \ nightfall and the mid-summer\u2019s breeze waltz in with her dress, her lips and\
  \ the sunset colours that comes to surface her fingertips from one island to the\
  \ next. Like Ed Sheeran\u2019s song, the voices around you do fade out as you deeply\
  \ inhale and dissolve into the wilderness.  What is it about silent moments that\
  \ can remind you of sweeping agony? It\u2019s quite ironic that I fear the smearing\
  \ heat on the southern back road, vastly empty dryness and I am deathly afraid of\
  \ exhausting temperatures. Yes, the same heat that at I simultaneously take pleasure\
  \ out of. That may sound like some form of innuendo, but it was not. Unless you\
  \ consider the mind chewing colours that swallows what feels like being caressed\
  \ by an unclean bar of soap.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t that long ago when I sat still in\
  \ my room, stared at my giant Atlas stretched across my entire wall \u2013 you know,\
  \ the one they sell in Ikea? I forgot myself and seeing that blank canvas gave me\
  \ hope. It was satisfying each time I was able to add a red pin. The same feeling\
  \ of escape that would come to me in forms of flimsy attempts to end my life as\
  \ a 13-year-old, or finding the right medium to self-inflict pain \u2013 you know?\
  \  No, I guess, maybe you don\u2019t know. I must admit, I cannot recall why I felt\
  \ the way I did, but I did, and in these colourful moments, I give my earnest gratitude\
  \ to fail suicide attempts. The beauty of this island helps you temporarily escape\
  \ from our plastic world, a world that had wished everything happened yesterday\
  \ and find something you\u2019ll least expect. As you make your way down to muted\
  \ waves, you\u2019ll notice rawness on strangers faces and feel their anticipation\
  \ as you carefully descend the red sand. I took my boots off and walked on the soft\
  \ stones, letting the waves flirt with my ankles. This is the Canary Islands, a\
  \ place of escape and even though the sky was old, the locals were just like any\
  \ other tourist with a lot of interesting clothes on their lines."
