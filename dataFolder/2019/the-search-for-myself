Text: "As soon as I arrived here in Italy I didn\u2019t expect anything. My thoughts\
  \ were all around what it would be if I finally got to find the real me. Every street\
  \ I walked was a discover of my history, people history\u2019s. Life brought me\
  \ here to remember we all come from the same roots. \n\nMany times in life we travel\
  \ to places we have never been and we intend to persue the happiness everyone is\
  \ talking about  either in social media, or on the dinner time. \nThis time the\
  \ value of my trip basically resumes to be me. Exactly, myself.\nThe unknown is\
  \ depper than what we imagine. I had to come here to find out that even if I was\
  \ in China, Portugal, NY, I would not find what I really wanted if I didn\u2019\
  t go further into reanalizing myself.\nI had to come to Italy, to eat very good\
  \ food, to learn (as kid) a language I don\u2019t know, make a lot of mistakes,\
  \ suffer with the culture to find that happiness is: a smile in a busy day, a hug\
  \ when you are feeling tired after getting in 3 buses to go home, or even someone\
  \ cleaning the dishes for you.\nIt became clear to me in this trip that life is\
  \ made of small little good moments, like taking the trash out, feeling proud of\
  \ yourself because you could clean the house alone without any help at least 2 times\
  \ a week. Happiness from what I learned is achieving this opportunity that all of\
  \ us want of getting to bed early and waking up feeling rested. \nHappiness is also\
  \ being loved and feeling someone cares truly about you and this means that this\
  \ person may come to visit you when you live in a different country or not. It means\
  \ a very good friend make you think that prehaps you aren\u2019t never on time and\
  \ for this reason you are not achieving your goals. \nIn Italy I realized that my\
  \ life was more than staying at only one place, that my house could be anywhere\
  \ and that I could create dreams and make them come true if I have the guts to go\
  \ for it and the positive mind, all of what I saw in social m\xEDdia or dinner time\
  \ became kind of true but much more tasty. \n\nThe other day, I had a very good\
  \ package of food with me and a lady was trying to smell my beg at the metro. It\
  \ was funny because I felt uncomfortable but at the same time I wanted to say what\
  \ was in the bag. \n\nSometimes I get very tired of being myself. It happens that\
  \ playing another character cheers me up. For so long I have been myself and choosing\
  \ not to be was something I did to not get bored.  \n\nBasically, every time I see\
  \ a stranger that helps me, every time someone say Prego or another Italian word\
  \ I don\u2019t know I discover a new me. Every wine I take, every food I eat, every\
  \ restaurant I go, the streets with rocks that I find, alleys, people, problems,\
  \ all of this makes me feel I\u2019m a new person. \n\nThe way Italians deal with\
  \ the problems and with people make me feel special. Somehow I\u2019m now part of\
  \ their culture. This is more important than anyone can imagine. The saying here\
  \ is \u201C I\u2019m Italian and I cannot keep calm.\u201D It toke me some time\
  \ to understand that but now I see that\u2019s a matter of perspective. Some people\
  \ show their heart by just being who they are and not thinking too much of pretending\
  \ to be happy for example and because of that Italians own my respect. They are\
  \ who they are and this is what I want for me. Being respected for what I am. \n\
  \nI keep wondering how many ancestors Italians I had in my life. It\u2019s interesting\
  \ to think that I am in this ancient city called Rome and that so many history existed\
  \ before me.\n\nAs I said before, the trip is not only physic is also in our minds,\
  \ and this one got me the way. \n\nI\u2019m all in!"
