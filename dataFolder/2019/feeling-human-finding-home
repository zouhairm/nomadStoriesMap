Text: "As perplexing it may sound, there are only rare moments now which allow us\
  \ to feel human; not to feel constrained by any national boundaries. Because to\
  \ feel like a citizen of any particular nation-state has become too commonplace\
  \ in the contemporary political scenario all over the world. Particularly in South\
  \ Asia, with its bruised and scarred history and geography, this feeling tempered\
  \ with heightened sense of nationalism has been quite usual historically. But then,\
  \ if one is lucky enough, life also gives an opportunity to experience bonds beyond\
  \ borders.\nNow this was around a year back, my mother and I planned a ten day trip\
  \ to Malaysia. And of course, visiting Kuala Lumpur, the vibrant capital city of\
  \ Malaysia was definitely included in our itinerary. During our four day and four\
  \ nights stay there, we expected to go around the city on foot or on wheels; cars,\
  \ buses or trains. We were excited to experience the local culture there which in\
  \ itself has been an amalgamation of so many different cultures, from Chinese to\
  \ Tamilian. And as expected we did experience all of it to our delight. Kuala Lumpur\
  \ is one of the most hospitable cities in the world having people with the warmest\
  \ of hearts; one of the best cities in the world, I would say, especially for female\
  \ travelers. But the best travel experiences are those when the unexpected happens\
  \ to you, reminding us once again that the universe is full of pleasant surprises\
  \ for all of us. \nIt was our first evening at Kuala Lumpur. We had booked a hotel\
  \ in the area called Little India. As Indians, we somewhat wanted to be in the comfort\
  \ of our national embrace even in a foreign land.   \nHaving reached our hotel later\
  \ in that evening, we could not find any cheap restaurants nearby to have our dinner.\
  \ My mother and me walked around the area and finally came across this restaurant\
  \ which serves food almost 24x7. We went inside and were greeted by this very warm\
  \ middle-aged gentleman. He took our order and served us in a manner which made\
  \ us feel at home. We paid the bill and thanked him for feeding us with such kindness.\
  \ The following days that we stayed in that city, we could not avoid going there\
  \ for our dinners. We formed a strange affectionate bond for that place and the\
  \ people who worked there. They too started addressing us as their \u2018favourite\
  \ mother-daughter duo\u2019. And every time we went there for a meal, our mutual\
  \ affection for each other only increased. We started having conversations beyond\
  \ simply ordering food. We realized that the restaurant has been owned by an Indian-Tamil\
  \ who has mostly employed Pakistanis and Bangladeshis. Migration has become a way\
  \ of life for some people. They have accepted this destiny of building a home away\
  \ from home with all shades of anticipation, courage and love.  \nThe man who served\
  \ us dinner during our first night at Kuala Lumpur is a Pakistani.  There was another\
  \ young man from Bangladesh with whom we formed a camaraderie based on our rivers\
  \ and the rains. Once I asked one of them \u201CDo you guys ever fight over anything,\
  \ given that our countries have had bumpy relations with each other?\u201D And he\
  \ replied, \u201CWell, we do have our share of fights and arguments but not as products\
  \ of parochial nationalism...mostly over food...like which biryani is better...haha\u201D\
  . I thought what a wonderful topic to even argue about; not about borders, not about\
  \ flags, not about language. Yes, beyond the comfort or constraints of our nationalities,\
  \ sometimes life is kind enough to make us feel human again. Home can be found beyond\
  \ national imaginations. On our last day, as me and mom had our last biryani there,\
  \ we were left with teary eyes at this thought."
