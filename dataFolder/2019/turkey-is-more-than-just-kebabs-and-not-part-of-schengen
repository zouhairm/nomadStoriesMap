Text: "It was an unexpected departure from Europe for Australia 3 months ago due to\
  \ work visa troubles in Amsterdam. I was forced to leave behind an incredible job,\
  \ an amazing new relationship and my affection for bitterballen and Belgium beer\
  \ for 90 days. In case you didn\u2019t know the rules like me, there are currently\
  \ 26 Schengen countries and they are essentially borderless once you enter, as an\
  \ American you can spend 90 days and then must leave for 90 days. Fast forward to\
  \ 30 days in Melbourne, Australia and a blooming long distance relationship I was\
  \ desperate to find a way to see my partner. The catch, 26 countries in Europe are\
  \ off limits for another 60 days, I am left with Morocco and Turkey. What do I know\
  \ about Turkey? They have good kebabs, so I\u2019ve heard. It\u2019s safe as a solo\
  \ female traveler according to a Facebook group of online teachers and the ticket\
  \ is cheaper by a few hundred dollars, sold! I am spending a month in Turkey!\n\n\
  Google: Istanbul, Turkey, 432 million results. AirBnb: 300+ homes and the map shows\
  \ there are several waterways dividing the city. I suddenly realize I am more clueless\
  \ than I thought. After several hours I was intrigued to learn that this \u201C\
  waterway\u201D is called the Bosphorus Strait and divides the city into the European\
  \ and Asian sides. Istanbul is truly a multi-cultural city with history and architecture\
  \ that reflect the many empires that have ruled. Excitement takes over and I am\
  \ making some headway, I have an accommodation, some ideas of neighborhoods and\
  \ a history lesson in the making.\n\n28 hours later flying from Auckland to Istanbul\
  \ and with the Uber app and an address I land at Ataturk airport, apparently the\
  \ more convenient one (SAW airport is about a $50 Uber to Galata Tower compared\
  \ to $15). I purchased a sim card from Turk Telekom for the month and ordered an\
  \ Uber, a large Mercedes van arrived (the only option in Istanbul). Driving through\
  \ the city to my Airbnb I was mesmerized by the mosques and juxtaposition between\
  \ grandiose religious structures and nearly crumbling homes. I arrived at my destination,\
  \ looked around and then at my Maps Me (pre-downloaded for the city and no data\
  \ is used) to get oriented. I rotate to move the GPS and I am confronted with a\
  \ hill, and by hill I mean a 27% grade by my calculations.  Realization #1; I had\
  \ no idea that Istanbul is the sister city to San Francisco as far as steep streets\
  \ are concerned. Then there were the stairs up to my flat, realization #2 elevators\
  \ are scarce and stairs are steep!\n\nThat afternoon I went out and explored my\
  \ new neighborhood for the next month, starting with what I had just researched,\
  \ where to get a kebab, or in Turkish doner kebap. This was like nothing I had ever\
  \ tasted, I didn\u2019t really know what I was eating, but let me just tell you\
  \ that Turkish bread, meat, French fries, tomato and a pickled pepper was no joke\
  \ for my taste buds! Walking around Beyoglu on now what I realized was the European\
  \ side, the history was palatable. Galata tower, built in the 14th century in all\
  \ its glory was just as Instagrammable as it looked and the scale was impressive.\
  \ Wandering the streets and weaving up and down the hills for the remaining afternoon\
  \ I was pleasantly surprised by the architecture, amazing coffee shops, outdoor\
  \ patio seating complete with heaters and friendly matches of backgammon and simultaneous\
  \ shisha. The friendly people flashing a smile, shopkeepers delivering bread to\
  \ the elderly via a rope and a basket and the community cats and dogs taken care\
  \ of by locals.\n\nOver the next month, I explored the iconic attractions of Hagia\
  \ Sophie, Blue Mosque, Basilica Cistern, the Grand Bazaar, Taksim Square and so\
  \ much more. The city of Istanbul was a feast for this photographer\u2019s eyes\
  \ and a history lesson was at every turn for the global citizen I am so desperately\
  \ trying to become. Learning to speak Turkish, well, that is an entirely different\
  \ story! And then there was Cappadocia, a world of its own!"
