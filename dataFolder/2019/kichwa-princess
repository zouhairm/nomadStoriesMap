Text: "Black and white photos covered the crooked walls. They showed men wearing tall\
  \ feather crowns and women with seeds as jewellery layered around their necks. This\
  \ was little more than a wooden shack atop stilts amid the looming jungle. Yet,\
  \ it was a home.  \n\nWooden spears decorated with green parrot feathers were propped\
  \ against furniture. A bow and arrow lay casually on the well-used table, covered\
  \ in stains and scratches. The dust and dirt covered floor boards creaked as we\
  \ all sat on wooden stalls facing the Amazonian indigenous tribal women and her\
  \ daughter. This was her home and she was not what I was expecting. \n\nThere were\
  \ two small rooms. A living area and a side room with a mattress and blankets. With\
  \ no windows, a dim light shed shadows on the old photos, already stained with age.\
  \ Her clothes were smeared with mud and were well worn, evidence that she had a\
  \ hard-working life in the Amazon rainforest. We had been helping her and her daughter\
  \ that morning to plant banana trees in the rainforest behind her home. I was already\
  \ shattered from the work, the persistent humidity that was almost claustrophobic\
  \ at times drained me far quicker than normal. It was a relief when she invited\
  \ us into her home to get out of the rain that had started to fall relentlessly.\
  \ \n\nLooking towards our project leader, she began to speak in Spanish. \u201C\
  She wants to tell you all a story, her story, while we wait for the rain to ease\u201D\
  \ our projected leader translated gesturing to the indigenous women. \n\nSmiling\
  \ at us and touching her hand to her heart the indigenous women spoke \u201CSoy\
  \ una princesa Kichwa\u201D \u2013 I am a Kichwa Princess. \n\nI wasn\u2019t quite\
  \ sure what I was expecting, but it was certainly not that. She spoke with a strong\
  \ voice, one that had evidently fought and lived a life that I could not come to\
  \ comprehend. She told us that as the princess of the Kichwa tribe, a peaceful community,\
  \ she had duties and responsibilities but not a voice. At this point in the story\
  \ she started to talk softer, her voice calmer and more tentative. This was a change\
  \ from the fire of which she spoke with before and from that it was obvious this\
  \ story was about to take a different path. \n\nAt 16, she was forced into an arranged\
  \ marriage with a prince from the Waorani tribe. \u201CEllos son los conquistadores\u201D\
  \ she whispered. Our project leader translated as we all picked up on the fear in\
  \ her voice, \u201CThey are the conquerors\u201D. It turns out that there has been\
  \ a long history of conflict between these two Amazonian tribes, the Kichwa and\
  \ Waorani. The Kichwa\u2019s hatred towards the Waorani tribe is so strong that\
  \ they refer to them as auca \u2013 savages. Unfortunately, in her father\u2019\
  s eyes this conflict could only be settled if the two tribe\u2019s unit through\
  \ marriage. Her marriage to the prince.\nWith no support from her mother and the\
  \ future of peace for her people dependent on her, the Kichwa Princess had no choice\
  \ but to marry into the conquering tribe. As expected it was not a happy marriage.\
  \ \n\nI had learnt very quickly that the Amazon rainforest must be respected. It\
  \ was after all, wild and untamed and dangerous to anyone ignorant enough to assume\
  \ otherwise. I quickly realised this after finding various snakes in the toilets\
  \ and a tarantula on the ceiling of the female dorm.  However, if the Amazon is\
  \ the back garden for your children to play in it may not always end happily.\n\n\
  Her voice considerably quieter, the Kichwa princess briefly told us of the death\
  \ of her son. With the nearest hospital several hours away, a bite from a poisonous\
  \ snake rarely takes a turn for the better. Her daughter took her hand and the mood\
  \ in the air feel sombre. We learnt that her husband had abused her. \n\nAuca indeed.\
  \ \n\nIt was only the concern for her children that gave her the courage to leave\
  \ and reclaim her father\u2019s territory. To return home to Kichwa lands. That\
  \ was where we were sat before her, listening to this tale."
