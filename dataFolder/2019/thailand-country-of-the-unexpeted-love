Text: "I had fallen in love with Thailand and I was sure as well that it was the country\
  \ where I wanted to move in with my boyfriend. But that time it wasn\xB4t about\
  \ us, it was just about me, and love anyway.\n\nChiang Mai had the most special\
  \ energy I\xB4d ever felt in a city, but it was time to continue with the trip.\
  \ My next stop was Sukhothai and as I wanted to try as many means of travel as possible\
  \ I decided to take the bus, which meant 6 interesting hours to get there.\n\nWhen\
  \ I arrived at the bus station I couldn\xB4t help looking at a gorgeous boy; tanned,\
  \ deep brown eyes and a huge smile. \"Where would he be going?\", I thought to myself.\
  \ And I give an answer to that question as soon as I got into the bus, because there\
  \ he was, sitting all alone... But I passed and decided to cross the whole bus to\
  \ sit at the end of it, \"what are you thinking Ana? You have a boyfriend!\", I\
  \ said to myself.\n\nAs the trip continued I realized that choosing that seat was\
  \ one of the most horrible ideas I'd had. And just when I started dreaming of a\
  \ regular seat the bus stopped and some people began to get off the bus. So as skillfully\
  \ as I could I got to the first empty seat I found... And there he was again! Anyway,\
  \ at that moment I didn\xB4t care at all and I just sat and slept for a while.\n\
  \nAs soon as I woke up (wrapped in all kinds of clothes as the air conditioning\
  \ was full) I heard a voice that said: \"Looks like the North Pole\". I looked to\
  \ my left, and all blushed I answered with a smile to the handsome boy. His name\
  \ was Etienne and from that point, we started a conversation that would end once\
  \ in Sukhothai.\n\nIt felt like it wasn\xB4t the first time to see each other, the\
  \ conversation just flowed so naturally... It was the most similar thing to the\
  \ idea of \"love at first sight\" I\xB4d ever felt. And just before saying goodbye\
  \ he asked me for my telephone number. Of course, I couldn\xB4t oppose to that,\
  \ I was feeling butterflies!\n\nThe next day, he proposed me to rent a bike and\
  \ visit the Old Town, what we did. It was simply amazing and the sensation of love\
  \ kept increasing. In any case, the next day I was traveling to Bangkok and he had\
  \ other plans, so our time was running out...\n\nAnd there I was, at the night train\
  \ feeling so blue because of a stranger... Until I fell asleep.\n\nI arrived in\
  \ Bangkok at dawn, and after the energy that emerged from every corner of Chiang\
  \ Mai, Bangkok felt a little gray to me. But when looking for my Guesthouse, like\
  \ a vision... I saw him just in front of me. \"Etienne!\", I decided to shout out\
  \ loud while my heart was about to come out of my chest.\n\nThe collision was super\
  \ intense! I just couldn\xB4t believe that Bangkok could create such an epic moment.\
  \ It seemed like a romantic comedy scene by scene. Anyway, we said goodbye once\
  \ again... Though this time was different, I\xB4d see him again the next day.\n\n\
  The next day we met at night and after hours and hours of conversation and so much\
  \ feeling, the bar closed and we decided that it was time to go, so Etienne accompanied\
  \ me to my accommodation. We didn't want to leave, I dreamed of having the power\
  \ to freeze time. And after an eternal silence... He kissed me! I had been avoiding\
  \ that moment all night, but finally, I decided to let myself flow... It was just\
  \ simply magical.\n\nThat was the last time we saw each other, but like true love\
  \ stories, it had an ending."
