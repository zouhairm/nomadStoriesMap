Text: "I have a habit of waking up in hospitals in Asia covered in my own blood. The\
  \ second time it happened, I was in China. I\u2019d moved there on a whim a few\
  \ weeks earlier and wound up with a teaching gig on the outskirts of Beijing. I\
  \ barely knew enough Mandarin to order a drink.\n\nIt was the fourth seizure I\u2019\
  d had; they were too irregular for doctors to diagnose the cause. That didn\u2019\
  t matter much to the school that\u2019d hired me. A few days later, I was unemployed\
  \ and sleeping on couches. Most people would probably take that as a sign but I\
  \ liked Beijing, I\u2019d made some friends, and I was determined. I hadn\u2019\
  t even been to the Forbidden City!\n\nOne of those friends helped me navigate the\
  \ Chinese health system, figuring it was worth another shot. On a Wednesday morning,\
  \ we woke early and trundled through the smoggy post-dawn streets munching on jian\
  \ bing\u2013\u2013savoury crepes filled with egg, fried bean-curd, hoi sin and other\
  \ magic, a quintessential Beijing street snack. Crammed together in a subway carriage\
  \ full of half-asleep commuters, Jacques explained what would happen when we got\
  \ to the hospital. Basically, we\u2019d take a ticket and we\u2019d wait.\n\nMy\
  \ number was 812. It was just after eight in the morning and the corridors were\
  \ filled with people napping, snacking, chatting, waiting. According to a nurse,\
  \ we\u2019d probably get to see a doctor late in the afternoon. That wasn\u2019\
  t unusual, according to the university professor we found ourselves sitting next\
  \ to, on the floor beside the entrance to the blood lab. \n\nThe average doctor\u2019\
  s appointment in a public hospital in China lasts less than a minute, he went on.\
  \ Doctors see upwards of a thousand people a day. \nEven if the figures weren\u2019\
  t surprising, they couldn\u2019t have prepared me for the apparent chaos of a busy\
  \ hospital in the capital. Doctors, nurses, patients, porters, cleaners and technicians\
  \ tumbled through the halls juggling clipboards, test tubes, medicines and all manner\
  \ of alien paraphernalia, somehow making it all work.\n\nJacques and I took it in\
  \ turns to stretch our legs, for fear of losing our prized position. From a window\
  \ at the end of the corridor, an outer corner of the building, you could see the\
  \ city sprawling out toward the southwest. The early-spring sun spilled soft light\
  \ over everything and, even if there were no temples or grand imperial designs in\
  \ that part of town, there was a certain charm to the office buildings and shopping\
  \ malls springing out of the swathes of Soviet-style apartment blocks. I guess the\
  \ trappings of routine life can be so seductive when everything\u2019s a mess?\n\
  \nAs I turned to walk back toward our spot in the hall, a young woman with blonde\
  \ hair, hazel eyes and a black, broad-brimmed hat walked past. She smiled at me.\
  \ I guess I smiled back, but, head addled by painkillers, by the time she'd disappeared\
  \ around the corner, I wasn't even sure I hadn't imagined her.\n\nA month later,\
  \ braces on my front four teeth where I\u2019d knocked them loose during the seizure\
  \ and still with no idea what caused it, I took my first Mandarin lesson at a teahouse\
  \ in the hutongs, the collection of charming neighbourhoods of old Beijing still\
  \ intact in the middle of the city. Persistence had paid off: I\u2019d found a new\
  \ job and had even started performing music in a few small bars.\n\nAs the lesson\
  \ ended, I joined the queue for the sole bathroom. I was silently practising the\
  \ expressions we\u2019d been working on when the woman in front of me spun around.\
  \ She wasn\u2019t wearing the hat anymore but I still recognised her.\n\nHer name\
  \ was Micaela and she was from Argentina. An architect who was learning to play\
  \ the bass guitar. We decided to start a band. That never happened, although we\
  \ did fall in love. One year and five seizures later, I moved to Buenos Aires with\
  \ her and they finally stopped. I guess the Chinese health system works in mysterious\
  \ ways. Although, according to Mica, I just stared blankly back at her when she\
  \ smiled at me in the hospital."
