Text: "It\u2019s easy to call a place home when you find comfort inside of it.\n\n\
  It\u2019s already at 5pm and we\u2019re still had a long way home. With that bumpy\
  \ road, foggy air, in the dark, no, we needed a place to stay the night.  I was\
  \ a little pessimist, I hardly even found a toilet the whole day, how were we supposed\
  \ to find a hotel? \n\n\u201CNot a hotel you idiot. We\u2019re staying in a honai\
  \ tonight\u201D Adit, my friend joked me,\n\n\u201CCan\u2019t we just go home now\
  \ please?\u201D I whined, he didn\u2019t respond.\n\nHonai is Papua's Traditional\
  \ House. It\u2019s just a one round space made by lumbers that comes with a bonfire\
  \ to cook on the center and a pile of straws as a roof. There are no partitions\
  \ inside. The floor is full of dried grass as a base covering the ground and a thin\
  \ mat to sit and sleep on.  People used to live with their pig and dog inside mostly\
  \ with no separation. \n\nAdit called someone he knew from the area, eventually\
  \ we\u2019re staying in simon\u2019s honai. We were welcomed by simon\u2019s dog,\
  \ not the friendly type I supposed, and we parked our motorcycle outside the woody\
  \ fence that has no gate to open it which was very impractical. The fence was made\
  \ only for precaution Simon said, he was afraid his pigs would run outside and got\
  \ hit by cars. From outside, the house was steaming, smoke came from the roof\u2019\
  s gaps. It was 10 degree Celsius outside, any kind of heater were needed.  By the\
  \ door I saw Simon\u2019s family were gathered around the fire, no chat, just a\
  \ quite night for everybody having their own conversation inside each mind. We greeted\
  \ them and got only a smile to greet us back. Can\u2019t speak a proper Bahasa Indonesia\
  \ Simon told me.\n \nLince, Simon\u2019s daughter, wiped her hand on her t-shirt\
  \ as she offered it to shake my hand. This cute little girl couldn\u2019t stop looking\
  \ at me and Adit, happy to have two strangers at her house I guessed. Not long before\
  \ Simon offered us diner. His wife boiled us instant noodles in somehow I called\
  \ it a traditional way, she crushed the noodle into pieces, put some kind of grassy-veggies\
  \ in it, and then overcooked it. I wanted to help but she insisted not to. The noodle\
  \ turned out to be like a watery porridge. Even though the food was not the most\
  \ tasteful and we didn't catch each other's jokes, we had a great night. These people\
  \ seemed so happy, even they've lived their live without luxury. Luxury that we\
  \ always take for granted such as toilet, electricity, internet connection, and\
  \ a simple light bulb.\n\n\"Adit, I need to pee!\", ugh again?\n\nPeeing on the\
  \ open space? Well I\u2019ll never get used to this one. Simon\u2019s honai had\
  \ no toilet, his family have to dig a hole first to defecate then bury it after.\
  \ They also pee anywhere possible, prefer closer to the fountain.  \"Dear bushes,\
  \ I'm sorry I peed on you\". \n\nAs soon as the night went by, I found it hard to\
  \ sleep. It was hard to felt comfortable sleeping next to a smelly pig. Also it\
  \ was too foggy inside because of the bad circulation. However we'd freeze to death\
  \ if we put the fire down. Adit had trouble sleeping as well. We quietly spent the\
  \ night laughing at the situation. They gave us a thin blanket that didn\u2019t\
  \ make us feel warm at all, yet that\u2019s the only blanket they have. They hugged\
  \ each other to avoid cold. Maybe I was cold outside, but seeing them and their\
  \ sincerity warmed my heart. \n\nIn the morning, I stunned. \n\nSomeone is sincerely\
  \ happy leaving in honai, they find comfort with the surroundings. Who am I to judge?\
  \ Comfort can't be measured by the facility your house have. Comfort is whenever\
  \ you feel cold, you have someone to hug you. Comfort is to have an intimate dinner\
  \ with your family every night. Comfort is to leave peacefully side by side with\
  \ animals and nature. \n\nI've found a home in Wakuo District, Papua. A night to\
  \ remember."
