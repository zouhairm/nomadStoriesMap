Text: "I can hail a car in any street in Havana and anyone can instantly become a\
  \ cab driver and pick me up, setting a fare, depending on my destination, whether\
  \ it is in their way or not and whether someone else shares the trip. Transporting\
  \ people is neither a legal nor a regulated activity in Cuba, but many common citizens\
  \ earning no more than 25 CUCs (25 euros) a month can at least double their income\
  \ to bring more comfort to their families in this or some other way. This Saturday\
  \ morning makes me imagine a story behind the grandmother that I sit next to. She\
  \ is taking a beautifully dressed-ballet dancer to class. The girl has her hair\
  \ tightened up in a bun embellished with delicate flowers.\n\nWalking by the Malec\xF3\
  n, on a Sunday afternoon, I watch the dark-blue ocean and couples or families chatting,\
  \ eating or just fishing. My unique adventure is to dodge young boys pretending\
  \ to do me a favor by recommending that I visit the famous Buena Vista Social Club\
  \ because today is the remembrance of some revolutionary occasion or other that\
  \ I cannot even question as I am not familiar with Cuba\u2019s history. No doubt\
  \ this young boy is expecting some coins in return for such \u201Cvaluable\u201D\
  \ information.\n\n\nSome others, like Janet,  just create stories. Wearing dark\
  \ hair evidently dyed blond, a gold tooth and sunglasses, she accosts us as we enter\
  \ University of Havana to tell us her views and stories of the revolution, under\
  \ the contrasts of the bright sunlight and shadows of the trees. Unused basement\
  \ refuges and the so-called life tree, because some intellectual revolution leader\
  \ was executed under it are the stories she makes us enjoy. False or true, she captures\
  \ our attention to the point where we invite her for a couple of cocktails in a\
  \ house where Fidel Castro supposedly had revolutionary meetings many decades before.\
  \  I tip her so I believe she will dye her hair again or have some new fancy gold\
  \ tooth that will make her stand out from the crowd.\n\nSome more risky business\
  \ is the Casas Cooperativas or Cooperative Houses. Approached in the street, as\
  \ usual, a superbly talkative guy seduces us through to a grey room, sparsely furnished\
  \ and poorly lit by a corner bulb. It looks like a basement where we could all disappear\
  \ as there is no mobile signal or GPS in Cuba that could have allowed us to be traced.\
  \ As we enter we find poorly-set tables laden with fake cigars bearing  well known\
  \ brand names on sale for a third of the regular market price. Of course, these\
  \ merchants make their sales pitch pretending to be \u201Cexclusively illegal\u201D\
  , meaning that we will not have a chance to come back because they are open just\
  \ today to avoid the risk of being captured.\n\nAfter 6 days in Havana, we decide\
  \ to say goodbye in a central bar, with live salsa and son Cubano, customary in\
  \ most restaurants and bars in the city. We arrive at around 11:00 pm and sit at\
  \ the only available table, by a no-glass window that allows the wind to relieve\
  \ us from the heat. We share an amiable chat as passers-by stop outside for some\
  \ minutes to watch the show and go. Probably it is what they are used to. And as\
  \ we chat, I observe that, some steps further, there is a man with no legs, sitting\
  \ on a wheelchair. He is not a beggar, he appears to be just talking to some other\
  \ people in the place. He is not looking for compassion. And I wonder what is the\
  \ story behind another person that has not been as lucky as I feel.\nImmune to the\
  \ different faces that beggaring has shown along this trip, I decide to pull up\
  \ an imaginary glass on the window beside me, in order to enjoy the longed moment\
  \ of sharing a good time with my family, drinking some rum based beverages and eating\
  \ some luxury snacks for which I paid around three Havana average wages. An inequality\
  \ from which neither the government nor any tourist\u2019s altruistic desires will\
  \ soon change."
