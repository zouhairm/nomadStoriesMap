Text: "I had only three days to visit Romania. Being born and raised in Mexico City,\
  \ this Eastern European country seemed outlandish and out of reach, thus, thrilling.\
  \  I thought spending Halloween night at Bran's castle (better known as Dracula's\
  \ castle) would be the best entryway to this land and to keep the thrill going.\
  \ \n\nI arrived in Bucharest and headed immediately to Brasov, a small city north\
  \ of the capital. Although the average car ride is around 2.5 hours, I decided to\
  \ take the train that takes around four hours to get to the destination. It's a\
  \ slower option, but a much more picturesque one. The old communist design in the\
  \ stations prevails despite the fact the country ended with the regime over 30 years\
  \ ago, the lean lines of the buildings were broken by the foliage growing near them.\
  \ In late October, the more I got closer to Brasov, the colder it got and the more\
  \ the autumn showed its burgundy and mustard beauty.\n\nOnce I arrived, I hurried\
  \ to meet Nadia, my tour guide and friend, in the Centrul vechi (old city town),\
  \ a friend in common made all the arrangements between us and she agreed to show\
  \ me her hometown in detail. We jumped into her car and headed to Viscri and its\
  \ fortified church. \n\nWhite, tall and robust, the medieval fortified church stands\
  \ in the top of a small hill and it can be accessed somewhat easily by foot. In\
  \ the streets that lead to the church, one can find merchants offering homemade\
  \ jam or homemade tuica (a strong drink made of plum) and all the tools needed to\
  \ make them. Nadia explained to me that the church was a place for contemplation,\
  \ but also a community center and a fort. Down the basement was a room dedicated\
  \ only for the preparation of the Slanina afumata (smoked pork fat) a dish that\
  \ can be found in local restaurants and definitely worth trying. \n\nOur next stop\
  \ was on Sighisoara, the last inhabited medieval citadel in Eastern Europe. Place\
  \ of birth of Vlad III (also known as Vlad Tepes) the place is in the center of\
  \ the citadel marked with a placard near to a restaurant called \"Casa Dracula\"\
  . Full of narrow streets that may or may not have a dead end, the citadel's main\
  \ attractions are for sure the towers, being the clock tower the main entrance to\
  \ the fortified citadel and the most beautiful one as well. At noon, 15:00 and 18:00\
  \ the fully working mechanical clock puts up a show. Both Viscri and Sighisoara\
  \ are UNESCO world heritage.\n\nAround 11:00pm we were entering Bran and my heart\
  \ was pounding. I was remembering Jonathan Harker's descriptions of Transilvanya\
  \ in my head \"Soon we were hemmed with trees, which in places arched right over\
  \ the roadway till we passed as through a tunnel; and again great frowning rocks\
  \ guarded us boldly on either side\" However, Bran was nothing like it. Trees arched\
  \ and the frowning rocks guarded us in a bright and festive town full of life. There\
  \ was a Halloween party ongoing\n\nEvery attendee to the Halloween party was \n\
  rigorously dressed in a very elaborate costume, dancing and keeping themselves warm\
  \ with tuica and vin fiert (hot wine) and eating coznac a traditional sweet bread.\
  \ The party took place in the entrance garden of the castle. \"You're lucky, the\
  \ castle will be empty and that almost never happens,\" Nadia told me. The festive\
  \ environment distracted me for a bit from Castelul Bran rising high in front of\
  \ me. The uphill walk was invigorating and cold. The building from the outside reminded\
  \ me of the church in Viscri. The castle was renovated several times and it served\
  \ as a fort and royal residence for Queen Maria of Romania. As Nadia predicted,\
  \ the castle was nearly empty and we could walk around freely to find out it is\
  \ a delicate and elegant country house mixed with tunnels and passageways made of\
  \ stone. \n\nWe left the castle at 2:00 am in the morning, nevertheless, it has\
  \ never left my heart. Brasov is a destination everyone should experience at least\
  \ once in a lifetime."
