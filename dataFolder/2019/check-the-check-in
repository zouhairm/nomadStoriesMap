Text: "I am in a constant travelling mode since May 2018, without really a place to\
  \ come back to. Sounds dramatical, but is intriguing as a state of mind. Constant\
  \ transfer between airports, cities, friends\u2019flats made me perceive the time\
  \ and space as one. The circumstances of a never-ending movement is something that\
  \ for me, being a dancer and choreographer, seems ideal and creates a mindset to\
  \ see details, spot exceptions and irregularities of the landscapes encountered.\
  \ You travel, you gain space, but what kind of experiance is really stored in your\
  \ body? I just came back from Chile which I travelled from a perspective of body,\
  \ because the landscapes I have encountered are really filling you from inside.\
  \ Glacier Grey in Patagonia, Crater Monteraqui in Atacama Dessert, the Cementary\
  \ da Chacarita in BA - those places stay as something more then images. I have reached\
  \ for them in a collective and individual expeditions. And after spending a month\
  \ in South America I came back containing those places. The incredible structure\
  \ of glacier, with its fragility and massivenes, can affect in the most cellular\
  \ level. Proprioception is the sense of traveller. Getting lost in the dessert makes\
  \ you relate to other material structures around, which are antropomorphic. The\
  \ rocks, the streets are shaped somehow similiar to our body structure. So it was\
  \ Santiago de Chile, Calama, San Pedro de Atacama, Valle de la Muerte, Valle de\
  \ la Luna, El Tatio, welcoming the New Year sleeping on the dessert, .....  Torres\
  \ del Paine, Puerto Natales, most not expected jump to Buenos Aires. All of this\
  \ because I was performing on Santiago a Mil festival with the piece \u201ECezary\
  \ Goes to War\u201D but what I went for during this last month was not anymore a\
  \ trail of what Pinochet left behind, it was a very distinctive adventure, through\
  \ sets that are as unreal as some events on stage can be. So I am holding now an\
  \ idea for writing a kind of scenography. Putting pieces together in order to create\
  \ a travel mindSET. Welcome."
