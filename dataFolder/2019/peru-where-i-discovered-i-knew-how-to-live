Text: "I never expected it, but life is terribly incredible, and suddenly it puts\
  \ you in front of a new adventure, a new challenge.\n Per\xF9: where I discovered\
  \ I knew how to live.\nThe most beautiful challenge I could undertake: my first\
  \ trip to South America.\n\n18 hours of flight from Italy, 10 flights in 10 days,\
  \ hundreds of km traveled by car, altitudes never experienced until now, frenetic\
  \ rhythms, a land rich in spirituality that completely overwhelmed me.\n\nPeru puts\
  \ you at stake, and puts everything in question.\n\nPeru is a hundred journeys in\
  \ one, and those ten days have seemed like a lifetime to me.\n\nBut at the same\
  \ time those days passed in the blink of an eye, and today i felt this sweet nostalgia.\n\
  \nHow amazed me my dear, I never expected it.\n\nI had and I still have fairly clear\
  \ expectations about America in general, but South America could not really imagine\
  \ it.\n\nI understood, after this trip, that South America can understand it only\
  \ if you live it, if you live it intensely.\n\nPeru is much more than what is imagined\
  \ in the common imaginary, it is not only Machu Picchu and Inca.\n\nPeru is a world,\
  \ a world to discover. The trip to Peru was the first real journey of my life, the\
  \ journey of the soul, the journey of awareness. \nGoing beyond, in the field of\
  \ culture and altitude, look at the world with different eyes than usual.\n\nTo\
  \ look inside the eyes of the people, in the depths of the soul of every person\
  \ encountered during this journey, to look far away, to the most mystical past of\
  \ the ancient world.\n\nTravel to be happy. Travel the unknow to find myself.\n\n\
  Traveling the peoples, the cultures, and not just the places, as I had done so far.\n\
  \nPer\xF9 Was the journey of discovery, the discovery of the same, the spiritual\
  \ journey.\nThe journey of exploration.\nBecause in the world there is much more\
  \ than what our eyes can see.\nYou have to feel the jounery, you have to touch,\
  \ to taste, to marvel.\nThere is an incredible, surreal, mystical story.\nPeru is\
  \ the journey that overwhelms the soul.\n\nThere is no more fear, there is no more\
  \ sadness, there is no longer that sense of emptiness inside, there is no negativity\
  \ in the face of so much beauty...\nThe Per\xFA evolves you, for the better. \n\n\
  I walked roads that I did not think existed, I met people who changed my life, I\
  \ felt emotions never felt before.\nLeave and give up everything.\nI realized that\
  \ I was doing exactly the right thing.\nI discovered I knew how to live."
