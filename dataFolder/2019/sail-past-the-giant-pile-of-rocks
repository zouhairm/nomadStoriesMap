Text: "My first memories of Portgal were in my fifth grade social studies class. Americans\
  \ love firsts. Vasco da Gama was the first European to reach India by sea. \n\n\
  Europe apparently had awful food in those days. Spices from the Orient were the\
  \ answer. Also important was to spread the Catholic Faith and don't tell Pope Alexander\
  \ IV otherwise.\n\nOcean travel has always held a sense of wonder; the danger, the\
  \ beauty, the unknown, the gamble, the payoff.  The nation of Portugal produced\
  \ some of the finest seafarers of the Age of Exploration.\n\nHenry the Navigator,\
  \ Diogo Silves, Bartholomew Diaz, Pedro Alvares Cabral, Ferdinand Magellan, Gaspar\
  \ and Miguel Corte Real. All names I remember from that class twenty years ago.\n\
  \nAn eleven year old boy's mind sure goes in a lot of directions.  My bike was my\
  \ ship.  Exploring new frontiers of my rural Northern Wisconsin hometown.  The colors\
  \ in the trees had just changed and wearing hooded sweatshirts always made me feel\
  \ comfortable.\n\nThe vivid colors printed in my text book from 1987 smelled a certain\
  \ way too.  What were the late 1400s actually like? They teased me everyday.\n\n\
  I wanted to know everything about history.  \n\nHistory happens everyday.\n\nThe\
  \ greastest way to experience a place is to notice what the people that live there\
  \ do with their days.  The food they eat, the things they drink, what sports they\
  \ follow, books, bands, tv shows, the local news; those are the things I love most\
  \ about travel.\n\nA fun game to play is \"Who would I be if I lived here.\"  We\
  \ don't have trains in America like they have trains in Europe.  I know I would\
  \ have something to do with the trains.\n\nExploration is something you will never\
  \ have enough of once you taste it.  Funny thing is your always trying to get back\
  \ to the first flavor.\n\nMr. Balko told us the explorers he taught us about were\
  \ to sail down the coast until they saw a giant pile of rocks.  Apparently their\
  \ instructions was to sail further and build your own giant pile of rocks."
