Text: "It took me a few seconds to realize he wasn\u2019t asking me a question, but\
  \ rather a riddle.\n\n\u201CWait, can you say it again?\u201D I asked, having not\
  \ heard him clearly the first time.\n\nThe server spoke more purposefully this time,\
  \ enunciating each word with a Cantonese accent.\n\n\u201CI have rivers but no water;\
  \ forests but no trees; cities but no buildings. What am I?\u201D \n\nMy smile was\
  \ genuine. Not because I knew the answer\u2014I didn\u2019t\u2014but because he\
  \ was the last person I expected to take the time to initiate a friendly conversation.\
  \ \n\nI was in Hong Kong, a city known for its traditional culinary heritage and\
  \ contemporary food culture. I had been enjoying many of the usual suspects\u2014\
  dim sum, roast goose, beef brisket noodles\u2014but I found myself drawn to another,\
  \ lesser-known type of dining establishment: the cha chaan teng. \n\nLiterally translated\
  \ as \u201Ctea restaurant,\u201D these humble, old-school diners have been serving\
  \ affordable, no-nonsense comfort food since the 1950s. They specialize in a cuisine\
  \ known as \u201CHong Kong-style Western\u201D which\u2014not unlike this former\
  \ British colony itself\u2014is part-Chinese and part-Western, yet neither Chinese\
  \ nor Western. Like the retro decor that defines their unique aesthetic, their popularity\
  \ has declined, but some can still be found, leaving a residue of nostalgia on the\
  \ city\u2019s culinary consciousness.\n\nTo the uninitiated or unprepared, dining\
  \ at a cha chaan teng can be jarring and stressful. The seating is cramped. Complete\
  \ strangers share impossibly small tables. Service is brisk and impersonal. (\u201C\
  Efficient,\u201D to put it nicely.) One immediately feels the pressure to take a\
  \ seat, order, eat, pay and leave, all of which can sometimes be accomplished in\
  \ under 20 minutes. There\u2019s certainly no time for idle chit-chat, let alone\
  \ riddles.\n\nThat this particular server\u2014a wiry middle-aged man whose messy\
  \ hair was the same shade of grey as his oversized (and overworn) sweatshirt\u2014\
  was bending these unwritten rules pleasantly surprised me.\n\nI was left to ponder\
  \ his riddle between bites of Hong Kong-style French toast (a single slice of thick\
  \ deep-fried white bread, served with a pad of butter and an unknown type of syrup)\
  \ and sips of the famous milk tea that give these establishments their name. \n\n\
  \u201CI give you hint,\u201D he said. \u201CThree letters.\u201D\n\nHe continued\
  \ cleaning tables and serving food, moving quickly, but effortlessly, the way someone\
  \ who had been working here everyday for decades might. We casually conversed as\
  \ he weaved in between tables, stools, and people. He wanted to know where I was\
  \ from, how long I was visiting for, what I liked best about the city.\n\n\u201C\
  Hint number two\u201D he announced. \u201CFirst letter\u2026 \u2018M\u2019.\u201D\
  \n\nI was embarrassed that I still couldn\u2019t figure it out. \n\n\u201CI give\
  \ up,\u201D I admitted in defeat. \u201CWhat is it?\u201D \n\nHe paused for effect\
  \ before succinctly answering.\n\n\u201CMap.\u201D \n\nOf course! Maps have rivers,\
  \ forests, and cities, but no water, trees, or buildings.\n\nIt got me thinking\
  \ about maps and their relationship to the world. Maps are symbolic. They represent\
  \ things, but they are not identical to those things. People often confuse the two;\
  \ that is, they confuse models of reality with reality itself. As the scientist\
  \ Alfred Korzybski observed, \u201Cthe map is not the territory\u201D (or, perhaps\
  \ more appropriately, \u201Cthe menu is not the meal,\u201D as the philosopher Alan\
  \ Watts put it).\n\nThis is as true of geographical maps as it is with mental ones.\
  \ Ideas are useful, even necessary, but they can also be flawed or incomplete. My\
  \ idea of how a cha chaan teng server should act, for example, didn\u2019t quite\
  \ map onto reality. Not this server. Not this time.\n\nI could see that people were\
  \ queueing outside, poking their heads in to see when the next seat would become\
  \ available. As I got up to pay at the front counter, he promised to tell me another\
  \ riddle if I returned the next day. Unfortunately, I was flying back home that\
  \ very night.\n\nSitting on the airplane later that evening, I looked at the map\
  \ on the glowing screen in front of me: rivers, forests, cities. I turned to look\
  \ out on to the territory through the window beside me: water, trees, buildings.\
  \ The two are connected. But worlds apart."
