Text: "It was my first day to enter a Khmer classroom; excited, I followed the road\
  \ leading to Angkor High School. The room, typical and crowded, was filled with\
  \ noise and notes written in chalk.\n\nI stepped in, silence ruled.\n\nI smiled,\
  \ students fixed eyes in innocence.\n\n\u201CHello,\u201D said I. \n\nQuiet. No\
  \ move. \n\nDesperately, I gathered my strength and convinced them I was nice. I\
  \ started talking like a teacher. We danced the morning with The Gummy Bear action\
  \ song, laughing at each other\u2019s funny kiddie movements. Trust was gained and\
  \ they started smiling.\n\nIt was hard to convey a message. Cambodia has a single\
  \ official language called Khmer. Almost 90% of its people speak and write Khmer\
  \ script. We had to learn the basics of English.\n\n\u201CThis is a ball,\u201D\
  \ my fellow volunteer started. The students repeated in chorus. \u201CWhere is the\
  \ ball?\u201D she started asking. They pointed to her direction, honest. She handed\
  \ the ball to one student at the back. \u201CThis is a ball,\u201D the student tried,\
  \ timid. \u201CThis is my ball,\u201D he smiled awkward, lower lip trembling. The\
  \ whole class laughed \u2013 the boy gave in, he burst as well.\n\nThe room was\
  \ in chaos \u2013 filled with awkward pronunciations and disordered sentence syntax.\
  \ It was a nice try hard \u2013 pushing to limits, and learning. No one judged;\
  \ everyone was proud with the new English phrase learned; repeated a couple of times\
  \ and carefully noted down to his smartphone, not to miss any. Almost everyone in\
  \ the room of 50 owned an apple phone or a high-class android; awe to a third world.\n\
  \nWe started playing, quite strange for students who were used in a traditional\
  \ setup \u2013 the lecture method. Stretched out, bones and muscles coordinated\
  \ to advance in the game. The front liners posed ready, pushing the two chairs at\
  \ the side, passing the pressure to the seats, best foot forward, running to hit\
  \ the bell first. Alas, but no alas, spelling is wrong. Chance was given to the\
  \ next group. Just fine enough to bet for another.\n\nIt was a four-hour active\
  \ learning session and everyone was still grinning, and couldn\u2019t stop talking\
  \ about one\u2019s awkwardness. The clock was ticking 12, and the morning shift\
  \ kids were already packing their things, still chatting about what happened. We\
  \ were gathering our stuff and about to leave the room, too.\n\nShy, one boy advanced\
  \ to our direction.\n\n\u201CThank you,\u201D he uttered. It was the first time\
  \ the class became happy, he shared in broken English.\n\nSpeechless, we smiled.\
  \ He bid goodbye, bowing his head, his hands hitching up the strap of his backpack.\n\
  \nLeaving the room, I knew exactly what school children need, more than ideas, they\
  \ need the inspiration to love learning."
