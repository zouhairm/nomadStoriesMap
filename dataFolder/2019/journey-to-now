Text: "JOURNEY TO NOW\n\nMy journey, unbeknownst to me began when I LET GO of the\
  \ life I knew from birth to 2013 at the age of 60, with ups and downs, highs and\
  \ lows, ins and outs... and everything else in between, of course! LIFE never promised\
  \ any of us a bowl of unpitted cherries... n\u2019est- ce pas? So, I began the transition\
  \ from a \u201Chands-on\u201D Mother who raised, homeschooled and relocated a male\
  \ child, from San Francisco to New York City, in order for that child to attend\
  \ an Arts based high school, then either launch to a job or University. His father\
  \ is deceased, making me a single parent. Oh, btw he graduated from University in\
  \ May 2018! His birth\u2026 began the greatest journey of my life. \n\nThe aforementioned\
  \ is necessary to lay the groundwork for the journey that launched me out of my\
  \ \u201Ccomfort zone\u201D into the world that would become my NEW comfort zone.\
  \ After letting go of our beautiful apartment, which was a sponsored ad by Airbnb\
  \ on Instagram a few weeks ago, turning my back on an empty space and memories of\
  \ three years, locking the door, and facing the unknown for him, and me... there\
  \ was nowhere else to go but forward! The world awaited, as a nomad lifestyle beckoned\
  \ me to venture out in FAITH to know myself at that season in my life. Without my\
  \ Son to define me and my life for 18 years,  I am still his Mother, but on my own!\
  \ \n\nDuring an introductory class I was taking at The School of Practical Philosophy\
  \ in NYC, I intuitively heard during meditation \u201CStep out of your comfort zone\u201D\
  , which I interpreted to be the USA, my home up to that point.  \n\n\u201COnce you\
  \ make a decision the Universe conspires to make it happen.\u201D Ralph Waldo Emerson;\
  \ and conspire it did. \n\nThe stars aligned, unexpected serendipitous happenings\
  \ occurred, people moved within my path who would be instrumental in helping me\
  \ to connect the dots behind me as I took my first step across the northern border\
  \ to Canada, then Europe, and the UK. I joined the worldwide volunteer organization\
  \ HelpX, in 2013 and have since been doing work exchange, or hanging out at hostels,\
  \ Airbnb, or with friends whom I met along the way from around the world! My first\
  \ HelpX work exchange was upstate in Cambridge, NY near Saratoga Springs, at an\
  \ organic farm\u2026 I milked a goat! Work, in exchange for room and food, was quite\
  \ a departure from living comfortably in a beautiful apartment on the Upper West\
  \ Side in New York City, raising a child. However, the concept of \u201Cretirement\u201D\
  \ is not for me\u2026 \u2018til death do us part!\n\nIn reflection, now as I write\
  \ my submission, I recall to mind a determination to step out in FAITH, not really\
  \ knowing what that meant, but if I had waited before I knew I would not be where\
  \ I am now on my journey to\u2026 NOW! Passing through the portals of unexpected\
  \ experiences: many countries, languages, cultures, and people, getting lost several\
  \ times before finding my way again\u2026 a metaphor of sorts, I am definitely the\
  \ richer for it. I can\u2019t even imagine not having stepped out beyond the boundaries\
  \ of the past, to the present laying the groundwork for future adventures. It will\
  \ be six years, August 2nd, 2019\u2026 unbelievable. I believe this was my path\
  \ to journey and meant to be for a purpose yet to be fully revealed as I continue\
  \ to take bolder, and braver steps forward. \n\nI just recently returned from Hawaii,\
  \ the Big Island having been invited to do a work exchange by hosts looking for\
  \ helpers who could help cook and bake product to sell at the local Farmer\u2019\
  s Market. I was in Montreal at the time with temperatures hovering below zero since\
  \ mid-December 2018 to the third week of January, following completion of the fall\
  \ semester at University in NYC\u2026. so, accepting the invitation was most welcomed,\
  \ lasted one month.\n\nAs my intuition serves me, returning to my birthplace celebrating\
  \ the 66th year of my life adventure on March 4th, I arrived having grown to know...\
  \ who I AM!"
