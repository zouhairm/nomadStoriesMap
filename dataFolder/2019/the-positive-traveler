Text: "I\u2019m choking. The air tastes solid and hot in my throat as I struggle to\
  \ take a breath. I stared back into the cool confines of the airport debating how\
  \ bad life could be as an airport dweller. Surely English lessons to waiting travelers\
  \ could earn me some cash. Arriving in sweltering mid-summer Hanoi is a sticky business\
  \ and choosing winter travel clothes is now a top contender on my long list of Worst\
  \ Idea\u2019s Ever. The air is on fire and drenched with the smell of new possibilities.\
  \ More importantly, I have arrived with a thick wad of positivity and a massive\
  \ itch to spend it.  As I tumble myself into the air-conditioned interior of my\
  \ taxi I reflect on the events that have resulted in my first breath of muggy Vietnamese\
  \ air. \n\nI had been violently mugged in Cape Town and suffered a human bite. I\
  \ had to get blood tests as part of the post-attack treatment. \u201CYou\u2019ve\
  \ got HIV.\u201D My doctor stated plainly and then left me alone to process the\
  \ news. I wasn\u2019t prepared and the words echoed around my head silently while\
  \ my future gently crashed down around me. The doctor left me sitting on the emergency\
  \ room bed behind off-white curtains. My first thought was how I was going to handle\
  \ this. I knew nothing about HIV except the terrible stigma attached to it, but\
  \ I had two clear options in my mind - either I let this news affect me negatively\
  \ or positively. I smiled slightly at the pun I\u2019d made and then shook my head\
  \ at myself for finding the humor so soon after the news. A month later I\u2019\
  d booked my first one-way flight out of my home country to a foreign continent...I\
  \ was going completely and utterly alone. \n\nThe taxi driver eyeballed my warm\
  \ winter clothing when I gave him directions to where I needed to go and headed\
  \ off in what I hoped was the right direction. I had no idea where I was and I was\
  \ strangely calm, harboring a whatever-happens-happens attitude. The road is full\
  \ of bikes navigating the narrow streets, seemingly without rules. My eyebrows were\
  \ permanently raised in anticipation of crashes that never happened. A family drove\
  \ past on a squeaky Honda Blaze with a double bed (base included), racing past a\
  \ man in a straw hat with a wire cage of scorpions strapped to the back of his equally\
  \ scooter. Wires crisscrossed the skies above me as if some angry electronic spider\
  \ was trying to catch a fibre-filled meal. Street peddlers sold everything from\
  \ bunches of litchis to freshly BBQ\u2019d strips of pork wound around bamboo sticks.\
  \ The corners were littered with adults either seated on small, plastic kiddies\
  \ chairs or doing the Asian flat-foot squat. Kids weren\u2019t wearing pants. There\
  \ were no homeless people, no stray pets. It was a whole new world and the taxi\
  \ was my magic carpet. \n\nFast forward 3 months. I sit in my window seat, reflecting\
  \ on the events of the past three months and decide to assign my choice to go to\
  \ South East Asia the Number One position on my growing list of Best Decisions Ever.\
  \ Traveling with HIV is not easy as accessing medication in various countries can\
  \ be quite a pain and deters many people from taking the first step. I managed to\
  \ get a long term supply to see me through indefinitely. Traveling requires a large\
  \ amount of trust in the universe. International travel with HIV, or any other chronic\
  \ illness just requires a little more planning and a heck of a positive attitude,\
  \ but it\u2019s totally possible and unmitigatedly worth it. I strapped my seat-belt\
  \ on and awaited the g-force of take-off with a gigantic, accomplished smile on\
  \ my face. Next stop: Kuala Lumpur."
