Text: "First travelling to Japan can be very challenging to some foreign people mainly\
  \ due to the initial perception towards the country and people.. I personally had\
  \ some barriers prior to my trip to Tokyo and other cities in the country which\
  \ is well known for the beautiful flower of Sakura.. I couldn't speak Japanese and\
  \ was afraid that people can hardly speak english and no familiar sign on the street.\
  \ Moreover, the image that japanese people are not open to strangers had created\
  \ another pressure to plan the travel. \nAs one of the reasons for the visit was\
  \ to learn Japanese language and culture by interacting directly with people, I\
  \ had organized some preparations. I have intentionally decided to stay with japanese\
  \ family by selecting the host family in internet instead of staying in the hotel.\
  \  I also tried to find some japanese online friends through language exchange program\
  \ where I can learn Japanese with native friends while teaching english at the same\
  \ time.. \nThe preparations worked very well and had broadened my mind horizon towards\
  \ japanese people as well as building the initial connection with them. They actually\
  \ are quite open to foreign friend even though we never met face to face. \nDuring\
  \ my actual trip I could meet up with those friends and totally had changed my initial\
  \ perception towards Japanese people.. I personally felt surpised that they are\
  \ very open and \ndo not try to create any gap with new foreign people, and even\
  \ in some certain cases they are more open as expected previously. By making a good\
  \ connection with the local people, I could easily understand and learn the culture\
  \ happening in the japanese community."
