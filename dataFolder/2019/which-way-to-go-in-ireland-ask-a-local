Text: "As I boarded my flight to Cork, I had no definitive plans for when I landed.\
  \  Up until two weeks prior, we had been awaiting clearance for my friend to join\
  \ me on this segment of my month long European tour.  Having traveled on my own\
  \ before, I felt comfortable sitting in the uncertainty.  Had she come, the trip\
  \ would have been orchestrated by her needs for accommodation and travel style.\
  \  Instead, I was heading to the Emerald Isle for the first time only knowing that\
  \ I was leaving out of Dublin in five days. \n\nWithout anyone to turn to, I felt\
  \ the expansive and also stifling freedom to set my own course like a book where\
  \ you get to choose the ending. Ireland is a fantastic country to explore without\
  \ a plan, the inhabitants are incredibly kind, proud and want to share their country\
  \ with you. The woman behind the rental car counter recommended and even loaded\
  \ the navigation to head to the Blarney Castle. I was reluctant to go to such a\
  \ tourist magnet, even though I was there in the off-season, but put my trust in\
  \ her advice.  \n\nWhile hundreds of thousands of visitors come to the castle each\
  \ year to kiss the fabled stone that gives you the gift of eloquent speech, the\
  \ grounds are even more impressive and grand. The Poison Garden is full of plants\
  \ and descriptions of how they attack and affect us, like did you know that rosemary\
  \ can cause miscarriages? The Blarney House harkens of a castle from a fairy tale,\
  \ and at the Wishing Steps you make a wish while going down the steps backwards,\
  \ a harrowing task for a wish.\n\nOf course not to be missed, even with a long line,\
  \ is climbing to the castle top and puckering up to the stone. Each step brings\
  \ you into rooms and learning moments about how the castle was built, lived in and\
  \ how the stone earned the reputation of giving the gift of the gab. As my turn\
  \ to kiss the stone approached, I had a moment of wonder, in part thanks to the\
  \ amazing views a top the castle, and also that my sister, my grandmother along\
  \ with esteemed dignitaries like Winston Churchill had all done exactly what I was\
  \ about to do. All of a sudden, I didn\u2019t feel like I was traveling alone.\n\
  \nCarrying that feeling with me, I braved driving on the other side of the road\
  \ to Killarney. The Black Sheep Hostel was incredibly welcoming and cozy. The kitchen\
  \ buzzed with travelers from all over the world preparing and sharing meals. My\
  \ favorite part was the bathroom off the kitchen, which was full of inspirational\
  \ quotes hand written on all of the walls.\n\nAt the front desk, I wondered aloud\
  \ if I should drive the Ring of Kerry the following day. The local chap behind the\
  \ desk shook his head no and responded, \u201CTomorrow will be the nicest day ever\
  \ in Killarney, do not waste it in a car.\u201D He grabbed a map and lay out a few\
  \ routes to see some of the best parts of the area on a bike and then gave some\
  \ recommendations for the rest of my trip.  \n\nThe next morning, dressed in layers\
  \ appropriate for late September in Ireland, I headed out the door. The pace of\
  \ a bicycle affords so many options to see the landscape that would be missed at\
  \ 35 miles per hour in a car, especially if you are the one driving. Like riding\
  \ in the forest through a myriad of green mosses, leaves and trees and coming across\
  \ a family of wild deer to my left. Exploring the haunting remains of Ross Castle,\
  \ the sun glistened off the water of Muckross Lake and the crisp clean air filled\
  \ my lungs. Thank goodness for this recommendation as it was a highlight of my journey,\
  \ riding alone with my thoughts in awe.   \n\nWith such an amazing start, I smiled\
  \ at how everything works out, even unplanned, if you are open to input from the\
  \ people you meet.  Certainly, my leap into the unknown of this country would result\
  \ in a lifetime of amazing memories."
