Text: "There I was: alone and stuck. BUT THE CLOCK WAS TICKING...\n\nAllow me to rewind:\
  \ \nI recently took a complicated trip, with multiple stops, to fulfill an item\
  \ on my dad's \"bucket list\" for him: \"Go to Cincinnati, OH then to Washington\
  \ D.C. via bus/train.\" It almost went horribly wrong...\n\nYou see, in Cincinnati,\
  \ I connected with my dad's former classmates to show me around his old high school.\
  \ During my final hours in town, I opted to go back to the campus alone to do some\
  \ reflection.\n\n2:30 pm- I wandered the area, journaled at different spots, and\
  \ even went into the depths of the nearby woods. After a while, I looked at the\
  \ time & realized I had stayed a bit longer than I meant to.\n\n4 pm- I prepare\
  \ to leave when I checked my pocket and realized that the napkin my late father\
  \ had mapped out this trip on was missing.\n\nAs you can only imagine: I am frantically\
  \ running around the grounds, re-tracing my steps through all of the trees... crawling\
  \ on the floor to look underneath cars...etc. I did not want to lose THAT napkin...HIS\
  \ napkin.\n\n4:45 pm- I finally concede & decide that I just had to leave it...\
  \ As I'm driving around the building I see an older man walking and I figured I'd\
  \ give it one final shot. So I get out of the car to ask him if he's seen it.  As\
  \ I approach him, in the corner of my eye, there it is... this glorious 4\" x 5\"\
  \ sight of white on the ground\n\nNeedless to say----the amount of relief I felt\
  \ was EXPONENTIAL. I, then, jump back in my car- pop the address of the airport\
  \ into my GPS, and the battery of my phone dies. \n\nThere I was: alone and stuck.\
  \ BUT THE CLOCK IS TICKING...\n\n5 pm- I wave down a car. In it was a man & woman,\
  \ mid-30's, with two children in the backseat.\n\nI tell them how I don't know my\
  \ way to the airport, my phone is dead and that I'm in dire need of directions.\
  \ \n\n\"What time is your flight?\" they asked.\n\nI said, \"Well I'm not actually\
  \ flying out. I got behind schedule, but I just need to drop my car off at the airport,\
  \  uber it to the bus station... to catch my bus at 6 pm...because that  is my connection\
  \ to my train to D.C. tonight...\"\n\n\"I'm sorry, but the airport is about 45 minutes\
  \ away from here and another 30 to the station...I don't think you'll make it...\"\
  - the guy admitted.\n\nAt that point- the toddlers in the back were getting restless,\
  \ so I just told them:\n\"I'll just figure out what to do....this isn't your problem--\
  \ but I do thank you anyway.\"\n\nThe woman says: \"Does your rental have two sets\
  \ of keys?\"\n\nPuzzled, I answer: \"yes?\"\n\nShe continues: \"I know you don't\
  \ know us. But if you want, you can just go straight to the bus station and we will\
  \ go ahead and go there, pick up your car, and return it to the airport for you.\"\
  \n\nMy eyes immediately teared up. I could feel this offer was something SO uniquely\
  \ special...so I took a leap of faith.\n\nThey gave me a slip of paper with directions,\
  \ gave them the spare key. We exchanged business cards and I was on my way...to\
  \ finish the mission I had begun.\n\n5:45 pm- I make it to the bus station and send\
  \ them a picture of where I parked.\n6 pm- I leave on the bus from Cincinnati to\
  \ catch my train to D.C.\n\n6:48 pm- I receive a text with a picture of the rental\
  \ car receipt and a message from the woman saying my rental was successfully turned\
  \ in & that she's glad I am safely on my way to my next destination...and to have\
  \ a \"blessed evening.\"\n\nSure I saw a professional baseball game, the beautiful\
  \ city lights, rode rides at a national amusement park- but the highlight of my\
  \ trip to Cincinnati was definitely the affirmation of how sometimes in life, strangers\
  \ show up and deliver the strongest gesture of humanity... when you need it most."
