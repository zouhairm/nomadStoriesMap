Text: "Ireland was the dream. It could be the allure of rolling emerald fields, the\
  \ inexplicable mysticism that seems to pervade the inhabitants and the country,\
  \ or it could be that there persists in me a clich\xE9d romantic who yearns to be\
  \ called \u2018love' in an Irish accent. Who could tell what my reasoning was? I\
  \ possibly could but would prefer not to, considering the sheer embarrassment that\
  \ accompanies having a schoolgirl crush on a country.\nWould I turn down a pizza\
  \ in Napoli or a Paella in Barcelona? Most certainly not! But through sheer force\
  \ of will and a dash of happy coincidence, I found myself in Ireland. Aimlessly\
  \ wandering the lawns surrounding Malahide Castle, to be exact. It was here that\
  \ I got a message from Ernie. Before you start conjuring up notions of a puppet,\
  \ this was not his actual name. It is the name he used for acquaintances that were\
  \ otherwise unfamiliar and shockingly inept in Gaelic. We, therefore, will stick\
  \ to Ernie.\nOur Irishman in question had heard that my friend and I had plans to\
  \ do some countryside adventuring and had asked if he could accompany us on our\
  \ coddiwompling. We had been in Malahide for a while when Ernie mysteriously hopped\
  \ over a fence. We did not know exactly where we were, so it still astounds me that\
  \ he managed to find us.\nI cannot specifically pin down when exactly we had met\
  \ Ernie- what with the menagerie of people we had met and the faces we had seen\
  \ in the multiple pubs and places that Dublin offers up to its adoring tourists.\
  \ The salient point being that we did not really know Ernie, but this fact changed\
  \ rather quickly in the shadow of Malahide Castle. It was here on one of the aforementioned\
  \ rolling emerald fields that we learned who Ernie was. \nHe was from a large family\
  \ who all lived together on a farm out in County Kerry. His mother was a school\
  \ teacher and as such he spoke impeccable Gaelic. His mother's vocation was incidentally\
  \ why he held such an exotic name.\nIn true Irish form, Ernie found great pleasure\
  \ in speaking about the history of his country. He told us of their great defeats\
  \ and equally great moral victories. He spoke with passion and maintained a sculptured\
  \ balance between melancholy and joy. \nIt was an uncharacteristically sunny day\
  \ in Ireland and thus our countryside host suggested an extended adventure past\
  \ the bounds of Malahide. He suggested a place called Glendalough. This fjord was\
  \ about an hour drive away and promised views fit for the sublime sunshine. I say\
  \ the word fjord with confidence, but at the time I had no cooking clue what this\
  \ man was talking about, and no it was not a communication lapse from our vastly\
  \ different accents that produced my consternation.\nAt Glendalough, Ernie explained\
  \ that a fjord is created when a glacier wedges out a crack in a mountain. The ice\
  \ melts over an innumerable amount of years producing a little lake at the bottom,\
  \ the perfect prehistoric spot for 21st-century ice-cream. A more idyllic day in\
  \ Ireland does not exist. It is a country of magic. Not the abracadabra sort with\
  \ bunnies bouncing out of hats. But a magic that exists in the people. People who\
  \ feel their past with an earnestness that leaves you breathless. People that take\
  \ pride in the simple act of sharing the everyday nuances that define their culture.\
  \ Ernie bought us our final pints of Irish Guinness, in a bar just off O'Connell\
  \ Street. He taught me how to cook the famous Irish potato, not a normal potato\
  \ by any standard. He made us laugh just as much as he laughed at our South African\
  \ peculiarities.\nWhen people ask me about Ireland, I do not talk about Grafton\
  \ Street or Trinity College. I talk about the people I met, I talk about Ernie.\
  \ They say that you shouldn't meet your heroes. This is what I feared when I journeyed\
  \ to Ireland. Ireland did not disappoint. The people of Ireland are Ireland and\
  \ they certainly did not disappoint."
