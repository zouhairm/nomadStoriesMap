Text: "\"Take the Kiwi, dude!\" Hanzel yelled at me as I made the decision to book\
  \ a flight to Bratislava from Dubai to apply in person to become an Emirates flight\
  \ attendant. \n\nHanzel and I had the opportunity with the nonprofit, Rose 2 Hope,\
  \ to volunteer at the Dubai Fitness Expo. Yes, two jersey boys rocking beards, beanies,\
  \ and two kiwi plush toys somehow found seats on a modern DMC DeLorean to get to\
  \ the future. \n\nIn America, the Middle East, beards, and wearing beanies in hot\
  \ weather in certain places with high skyscrapers provoke funny glares. In Dubai,\
  \ we were shocked to be welcomed into the belly of a new melting pot covered in\
  \ cleaner metal skin all around the city rising from the ground. \n\nWe decided\
  \ to bring two kiwi plush toys after an inside joke, started by making kiwis appear\
  \ out of nowhere, made us realize whenever in doubt, do the most random choice.\
  \ \n\nAt the Fitness Expo, we meet many people from all around the world. Along\
  \ the people, we meet 4 Emirates Flight attendants. They all convinced me to apply.\
  \ I cut the trip in the future short to take the random choice of going to another\
  \ country where I ended up meeting friends of a lifetime all thanks to the philosophy\
  \ of Kiwi. \n\nIn Bratislava, I foamed a group called, Emirates Street Crew-anyone\
  \ who were denied to become an Emirates Flight Attendant.  I told the crew my kiwi\
  \ story. Along the rejected was a man who made me realize I made the right choice\
  \ to come to Bratislava.\n\n\u201CThat is too funny, I work for a Czech online travel\
  \ agency you may like. Have you ever heard of the website kiwi.com? You should apply\u2026\
