Text: "My peers were joyfully screaming as they ran around a play area in Charles-de-Gaulle\
  \ airport. I sat against a wall, looking on from afar, laughing occasionally and\
  \ snapping pictures with my expensive camera when an unfamiliar voice came from\
  \ behind me:\n\n\"Excuse me, miss. You have a lovely voice.\"\n\nI turned around\
  \ and faced an older woman.\n\n\"You're not from here\"\n\nI smiled, \"No, I'm just\
  \ on a trip.\"\n\n\"Oh, those are your friends?\" She pointed toward my group.\n\
  \n\"Uh, I guess you could say that. I don't really know them. We're just traveling\
  \ together; they're from my school.\"\n\n\"I see,\" she laughed, \"Well, you all\
  \ have lovely accents. Are you from London?\"\n\n\"No, no. We're from the northern\
  \ US, actually. Thank you, though,\" I said.\n\n\"Oh, I have a daughter there! would\
  \ you like to see my daughter?\"\n\nHer smile had a crack in it and she stared a\
  \ bit above my shoulder as she spoke. I shrugged.\n\n\"Here, I show you!\" And she\
  \ dropped her phone into my hands.\n\nHer daughter was pretty; they had the same\
  \ brown eyes. She was wrapped in a bright pink cloth with a blue flower design,\
  \ with wooden sandals on her feet. In her arms was a large wire-haired, shaggy dog.\n\
  \n\"I'm on my way to see her now. She's getting married, but not until Momma says\
  \ it's okay, of course!\" She threw her head back and laughed.\n\n\"I'm sure she's\
  \ pleased at the prospect of seeing you.\" I joked.\n\n\"Do you see your mother\
  \ often?\" She asked me, her tone suddenly serious. Her dark brows furrowed.\n\n\
  That made me stop and think. I wondered if my mother was approaching total strangers\
  \ to show them my pictures and talk about the university I got into and the hospital\
  \ I worked at. I wondered where she was. \n\n\"Often enough,\" I smiled. Now it\
  \ was my turn to seem distant and avoid eye contact.\n\n\"Well, I must be going.\
  \ I wanted a sandwich before my flight.\" She held her hand forward for me to shake.\
  \ I gave her my hand, and she pulled me into a warm embrace.\n\n\"Much peace to\
  \ you, young traveler. May you see your mother and find your home soon,\" she said\
  \ before turning around.\n\nI snapped a quick picture of this stranger on my camera.\
  \ A week away from home, and I finally felt like I made a friend. A sandwich sounded\
  \ like a good idea, or at least something to drink.\n\nI wandered around the airport\
  \ looking for a convenience store. After finding one and standing in line to pay\
  \ for my coffee, I noticed a newspaper sticking out.\n\n\"VICIOUS ATTACK IN PARIS\
  \ LEAVES ONE DEAD AND SEVERAL WOUNDED!\" It read. But I wasn't staring at the headline.\
  \ I was staring at the picture. Smiling up at me was the same woman I had just conversed\
  \ with, the one with the sad smile and the beautiful daughter.\n\nThe date of the\
  \ newspaper was from the previous evening."
