Text: "Less than two years ago, I realized a dream of to travel around Asia. Just\
  \ arriving in the first stop, I could feel how the connection and the people were\
  \ so good for me. After some days around Uluwatu me and my friend just decided to\
  \ go to Ubud to spend some days around the rice plantation. We booked a hotel, which\
  \ just is inside of a plantation of rice, just in the middle of nowhere, the connection\
  \ of the nature, with the people, were to strong. Each place, each guide, each Balinese\
  \ people, just was always ready to help us, to talk to us and to share something\
  \ good. Doesn't matter the circumstances, we always could see a big smile, in exchange\
  \ for nothing. Feeling extremely good, and at home, we rented a motorbike to run\
  \ around the island and to discover new things. We visited a lot of rice plantations,\
  \ withe their such small streets, which was really hard to pass by motor and with\
  \ 2 people. Many temples, with such beautiful views, not counting about the beaches,\
  \ simple and spectacular. Boys and girls ruining with their boards, to get the best\
  \ wave ever. Sirs and ladies, selling their own products and when wasn't possible\
  \ to sell they just tried keep some conversation, by they own English. \n\nAt the\
  \ last temple, we had a surprise, which one that could to prove all this connection\
  \ with Bali, one Sr. already passing the 65 years, asked if we were hungry, it was\
  \ later than 1 pm, we thinking about to have some lunch at the temple the answer\
  \ were yes. He just took  some coconuts, started to open it, and get off the skin,\
  \ cut it in three pieces, one to himself, one mine and the third one to my friend.\
  \ We didn't expected it, and also we wasn't thinking to have a coconut for lunch,\
  \ but the simplicity and the happiness on his face was indescribable and we could\
  \ say no. He was just looking for someone to spend some time, he told us about how\
  \ long he didn't get lunch with others. \n\nAfter it and after days in Ubud was\
  \ time to leave, leaving the hotel in the middle of the rice plantation, we said\
  \ to the owners how we felt so good in Bali and about ho many big hearts we had\
  \ met in there. He got so proud about their people and smiling just give us one\
  \ card to give us a ride till the next stop. \n2 days latter, already in Gili Trawagan\
  \ another Island in Indonesia, we received an e-mail, from the rice plantation hotel,\
  \ saying that we had forgot some money in the hotel. As the money in Bali is so\
  \ different from the USA dollar, we just though that it was a small amount. When\
  \ we replied asking if the money were from Indonesia, they replied back saying that\
  \ it was 10 notes of $100 USA dollar. \n\nWith all this experience in Bali, I could\
  \ \"understand\" that to them, the money is just a little thing and what's really\
  \ matter is what you have to offer beyond all the money that you can have."
