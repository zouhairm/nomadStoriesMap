Text: "I wasn't expecting my first travel experience to be so stylish, but when a\
  \ perfect stranger offers you the dressing room Winnebago from Priscilla Queen of\
  \ the Desert, you don't decline. They gave me no limitations, no 'bring her home\
  \ before 11pm', and definitely no guidelines on how to travel. So, with no experience\
  \ under my imaginary belt - I don't need one thanks to all the roadhouse breakfasts\
  \ - I headed out to see the red earth for the first time. Being Tasmanian, I was\
  \ surprised to discover you can't cross most states in 3 hours like back home. I\
  \ was even more surprised to find out that when you blow a tyre out in whoop whoop,\
  \ the RACT don't show up in their magical blue and yellow van. Instead, a man called\
  \ Trevor who doesn't make eye contact but knows how to fix a flat tyre does. He\
  \ looked at the motorhome, then at me, then back at the motorhome before getting\
  \ to work. To this day I don't know what Trev was thinking, but I'm forever grateful\
  \ he didn't leave me stranded. It's important to know I have selective hearing,\
  \ so when he said he was going home to Cadbury I didn't hesitate to follow at a\
  \ rapid pace. My mind set on a giant chocolate factory, it didn't occur to me that\
  \ perhaps dairy and 40'C days weren't a good mix. When we arrived at Cadney roadhouse,\
  \ my heart melted just like all my chocolate dreams. With a teary farewell, I continued\
  \ on my way to find a nice, normal place to rest for the night.\n\nA full moon was\
  \ rising, the air growing still and loud from cicadas nearby. A small motor inn\
  \ appeared in front of my eyes, perfectly normal in appearance. I passed a sign\
  \ as I drove in: Wycliffe Well. As the walls of the building came into focus, I\
  \ saw murals and statues of something I never thought to see in the middle of the\
  \ desert: aliens. Clearly I had to stay now. The whole place felt sad, like a dying\
  \ dream. It added to the creepiness and to my curiosity. Walking inside, the place\
  \ was covered from ceiling to floor in newspaper articles. \"Sightings at Wycliffe!\"\
  \ they screamed. \"Abduction Stories from the Northern Territory!\" \"Curious Disappearance\
  \ from Australia's Centre!\" Outdated computers were littered around on tables,\
  \ spluttering to life and providing access to an even larger database of stories.\
  \ But I was more interested in what happened to Wycliffe Well instead of what happened\
  \ at it. With less abductions since the aliens figured out that Cadney was not,\
  \ in fact, filled with milky goodness, the alien capital of Australia was more of\
  \ a memory than an attraction. A lonely site in the middle of nowhere, waiting for\
  \ something to happen. As I looked around, discovering some artistic toilet blocks\
  \ and a naked cockatoo that laughed at me, I realised something. The stories didn't\
  \ make this place an attraction for me. Wycliffe Well itself was what it was all\
  \ about. Someone's dream of seeing aliens connected people and places all around\
  \ the world, everyone wishing for the same dream and sharing their stories of mysteries\
  \ and UFO's. Even I could add my own story of a UFO sighting back home in Tasmania,\
  \ seeing a floating bullet-shaped craft start moving slowly before fading into nothingness.\
  \ This place was built and is constantly being built on stories. The frame of the\
  \ building may be old and neglected, but a place with heart can never truly die\
  \ when the dream keeps beating. \n\nI've seen many more amazing places since then,\
  \ but Wycliffe Well stays strong in my memory. If a series of unusual events could\
  \ get me to the alien capital of Australia, I learned that adventures are never\
  \ what you planned them to be. And that's all the fun of it."
