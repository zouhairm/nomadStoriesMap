Text: "Why do I say Prague is a mystical city? Because many castles and buildings\
  \ are looked \"dark\" and mysterious yet charming in this city. Plus, I came in\
  \ January which was cloudy and rainy which is the ambience was supportive to made\
  \ it mystical. Every road and building has its own attraction and history, especially\
  \ in the city center.\n\nThe first place I visited was N\xE1rodn\xED Muzeum or Prague\
  \ National Museum. This building reminded me of one of the scenes in the 007 Casino\
  \ Royale movie. A suggestion from me, come here at night because of the very good\
  \ lighting outside the building.\n\nThen, I walked to the side of the Old Town Prague\
  \ and this is my highlight. It took around 2 hours to strolling around and enter\
  \ several places in this area. Places I visited are Municipal House, Astronomical\
  \ Clock Tower, The Powder Tower, and The Church of Our Lady before Tyn. Along the\
  \ Old Town Prague street, many small shops that sell Trdelnik, typical Prague bread,\
  \ I stopped and I tried it. It was good with a hot chocolate. Continue on to Charles\
  \ Bridge, I took time to see the scenery on the edge of the bridge and enjoyed my\
  \ view. And last, I took the Tram to go to Prague Castle, a mandatory place to visit.\
  \ If you don't go there, I can say you haven't been to Prague. I recommend you to\
  \ come to Prague Castle first in the morning.\nAll the places I mentioned above\
  \ can be visited in one day if you start from 10 a.m. Don't forget to buy your transportation\
  \ ticket because controllers sometimes come and want to check your ticket.\n\nNotes:\
  \ If you brave enough, there is ghost city tour offers in Prague. Try it to feel\
  \ more mystical of the city!"
