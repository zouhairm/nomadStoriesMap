Text: "\u201CIf there is anything that Lebanon does not have a shortage of, it\u2019\
  s rocks,\u2019 says our guide as we round a sharp curve along a thick wall of limestone.\
  \ It is past 6:00 pm, and the sun has already set, but our bus continues to make\
  \ its way through a precipitous mountain climb, with dangerous cliff drops just\
  \ inches from our windows.  \n\nI close my eyes and recall the majestic tranquility\
  \ of our earlier walk through the forest of the Cedars of Lebanon in the Beqaa Valley.\
  \ In ancient times, these trees once thrived in Mount Lebanon, and are called \u2018\
  Cedars of God\u2019 because they are said to have been planted by God. \"The trees\
  \ of the Lord are watered abundantly, the cedars of Lebanon that he planted,\u201D\
  \ says the psalmist (Psalm 104).  Though we are far enough from what remains of\
  \ the cedar forest, I inhale its woody evergreen scent in my imagination to keep\
  \ myself calm.\n\nThe tour group is on our way to the Monastery of Saint Anthony\
  \ the Great of Qozhaya in the Quadisha Valley. Finally, we pull up what looks like\
  \ a dead end, with a small number of seemingly abandoned cars parked alongside the\
  \ street.  \u201CWhat are we doing at this forgotten place at the bottom of a deep\
  \ valley, in the pitch black night?\u201D I wondered.\n\n\u201CGet out, get out\
  \ the bus now,\u201D our tour guide encouraged us on, but I couldn't help but feel\
  \ that we were only being led to another stone wall.  With very little to go by,\
  \ we all inched toward a small gleam of light further ahead, which then opened up\
  \ into a spectacular spiritual haven. Shadows of worshipers, walking with deep reverence,\
  \ seemed to come out from the crevices. \n\n\u201CYou must know, that to understand\
  \ Lebanon, you must understand the conflict of our multiple confessions,\u2019 said\
  \ our guide.  \u201CLebanon consists of Muslim Shiites and Sunnis.  The country\
  \ also has twelve Christian confessions: Maronite Catholic, Greek Orthodox, Melkite,\
  \ Armenian Orthodox, Armenian Catholic, Syriac Orthodox, Syriac Catholic\u2026\u201D\
  \ he continued to list them but I couldn\u2019t keep up.  According to recent statistics,\
  \ Lebanon is 54% Muslim, 41% Christian, and 5.5% Druze, along with a small number\
  \ of other faiths.\n\nA recent Civil War, from 1975-2000, mostly between Christian\
  \ Maronites and Palestinian Muslims, involving shifting international alliances,\
  \ has resulted in a Lebanese society whose faith lives have been tested and strengthened\
  \ by the crucible of conflict and death.\n\nMost Lebanese Christian families (as\
  \ with Muslims) know someone who has died as a result of one war or another, or\
  \ has fought in the Civil War. No wonder then that they cling to their faiths as\
  \ young children cling to their mother\u2019s hem.\n\nAlmost immediately, I am drawn\
  \ to the Grotto of Saint Anthony, a natural cave dedicated to the saint.  At the\
  \ altar in front of the cave, a young couple both hold onto a grey, oblong, smooth\
  \ stone with a hole at each end. They are praying quietly, he in Arabic and she\
  \ in French, their lowered dark lashes veiling their eyes, as the candle smoke cuts\
  \ through the cave\u2019s mustiness.  They are probably praying for a child, as\
  \ this grotto is known for such miracles. \n\nCountless supernatural phenomenon\
  \ are attributed to Lebanese saints, most of whom are unknown to much of the world,\
  \ like Saint Charbel (1828-1898), whose intercessions after death have healed many.\
  \ \n\nFor me, the saint who most embodies the country of Lebanon itself is Saint\
  \ Rafqa (1832-1914), a Maronite nun who, despite her intense share of Christ\u2019\
  s suffering through blindness and paralysis, continually gave praise to God, and\
  \ maintained her peace and joy.  And she used her hands, the only part of her body\
  \ she could move, to weave beautiful patterns.\n\nThat is the way of the Lebanese\
  \ Christians I encountered. Without a doubt, every Lebanese I saw, personally knew\
  \ the pain of crucifixion in one way or another. Yet rather than giving visitors\
  \ bitter gall, they offered -  without cost - golden wax candles, scented frankincense\
  \ oil, and incense of myrrh."
