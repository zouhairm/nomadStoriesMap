Text: "There was a sense of victory in embarking on the much awaited hike at the optimum\
  \ time with the virtuous company. But soon the feeling started fading in since the\
  \ sun was nowhere to be found and the sky is clouded and so do our judgement. We\
  \ were still on the paved trails and waiting for the unknown and dangerous territory\
  \ to unravel itself.  Soon the cloud became the droplets but not big enough to devoid\
  \ us from the experience which was just few steps ahead of us.\n\nI sensed sudden\
  \ chill down my spine the moment I stepped on the floor of the Lava Field Territory.\
  \ It was sharp, slippery and uneven.  We managed to walk couple of minutes before\
  \ it was time to turn on the flash light. I took out mine and passed another one\
  \ to my husband. But to our uttermost shock one of them was of no use since the\
  \ light was too dim. A diminishing  ray of light which is no good for normal roads\
  \ whereas we have a dangerous roller coaster ride ahead of us on the Dragonstone\
  \ .(I am a  GOT Fan \uF04A).\n\nOne wrong fall and you can either cut yourself or\
  \ you can be in crevice filled with molten Lava. My mind was racing and everything\
  \ stopped making sense. I usually test all the logistics before mastering my packing\
  \ tasks. A speculation of what went wrong this time pointed out that the flashlight\
  \ was tested in a brightly lit room. \n \nWhen you are a budget traveler and have\
  \ the fear of #Fomo, you can\u2019t even risk of turning from adventure lying ahead\
  \ due to some logistics issue. My husband was trying to convince me that we can\
  \ manage with one flash light and also he was trying to avoid a huge disappointment\
  \ of an outdoorsy wife.\n \nThe biggest challenge in this hike is to find the destination.\
  \ It\u2019s a pitch black dark field and you have to follow only two rays of hope,\
  \ either it\u2019s a flash light of someone else or it\u2019s an orange light which\
  \ can glow in any direction. So you need to look down once with your flash light\
  \ on and then look up to follow your rays of hope. Even tailgating fellow hikers\
  \ was futile as it lasts only for fractions of seconds and soon they disappear because\
  \ everyone is fighting their own war.\n\nFinally after few hours of prayer and hope,\
  \ we could see some orange glow towards our left and we aligned our line of sight\
  \ towards the same. The closer we were getting to the glow, the scarier was the\
  \ danger beneath our feet. There was actually a very thin line between us and the\
  \ molten lava. \n Once we reached to the place where actual lava was flowing in,\
  \ there were couple of people surrounding it and taking selfies. It was breathtaking\
  \ view and you can forget your past journey while witnessing the blessing of Goddess\
  \ Pele.  \n\nOnce we absorbed the event entirely within our soul, it was time to\
  \ drift away as you should not inhale the toxic gas plumes from lava for long time.\n\
  \nThe return journey was more difficult because we can\u2019t follow the lava glow\
  \ anymore and there is no way to trace back your trail. Then my husband who is still\
  \ an old school chap who doesn\u2019t rely on GPS for directions finally spotted\
  \ one road light which was the only light on the paved road leading to the entrance\
  \ of the field. That light was also playing hide and seek with us due to lows and\
  \ highs of the cliffs on the molten lava deposits. Soon tripping and falling we\
  \ managed to reach to the gates .We came back alive from the mouth of Goddess Pele\
  \ unharmed. Soon when I hit the bed of my Airbnb, I realized how fear plays with\
  \ the wires of your brain because I had so many spare batteries in my pack but the\
  \ idea didn\u2019t even strike at any point.\n\nBesides It felt like Goddess Pele\
  \ was indicating that today is not your day and your insatiable travel soul still\
  \ need to witness a lot more wonders in the world."
