Text: "We went to this church, it's called Basilica. Lets leave the history aside,\
  \ begin the fun part. Had to walk up the hill, to reach there. As we did, we went\
  \ straight up to the lift. 50th floor, I Clearly remember. There was ground, first,\
  \ and the top of the church. But wait, there's more. As we reach, we had to walk\
  \ in this steep bridge with obviously nothing but black background beneath you.\
  \ Consider your virtual reality trauma giving you esctasy. As you walk, completing\
  \ 30 metres ahead you almost feel powerful, daring that you completed the fucking\
  \ bridge. \nOn the end of the bridge, comes the steep stairway. Imagine me, walking\
  \ with a go pro in my left hand, my camera wrapped in my neck, my camera bag because\
  \ I wish I could afford an assistant to hold all my other stuff. One Ray of light\
  \ falling from the triangle shed above you, camera, action, walk. Walk towards the\
  \ end of the bridge, climb the stairway, congratulate yourself for doing this all\
  \ by yourself. As you reach the top, out from the stairway, you realize it's fucking\
  \ worth it. 360\xB0 view of the colorful city round and round , I take 3-4 rounds.\
  \ Find a corner, where my group finds me only when they look for me. And I stay\
  \ still. Watch. Observe. Learn pretty much nothing. No deep thoughts. Just me, and\
  \ the view. The life goes by down there, and here we are above everything. Every\
  \ single time we all go to one of these places we realize the importance of a moment.\
  \ A moment you are ready to always remember. About the moment, couriousity arises,\
  \ how much it can be repeated in your head to make you feel content. The question\
  \ is, Can a good view of a city make you feel that way? Do you let it in? Or do\
  \ you take a picture of it, and move on. Never look back on that same place again\
  \ because you already did and you might feel it's a waste of time to remember. Goodord,\
  \ I hope not. I hope you remember that moment, close your eyes. Look back, smile."
