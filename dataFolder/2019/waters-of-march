Text: "Living abroad is full of curious experiences, the most humbling of which often\
  \ occur after initial culture-shock has subsided, and a sense of complacency has\
  \ set in. After three months of living in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, I was convinced\
  \ I had surpassed the many rites of passage that face foreigners living the city.\
  \ I had survived theft, a convoluted bus system, and late night walks along slightly\
  \ suspect streets. And yet, I was still afraid to even order a coffee in Portuguese.\
  \ Humility is perhaps the greatest lesson to be learned from traveling abroad.\n\
  \tMy lesson began like this: one night, as late-summer rains hammered the famous\
  \ mosaic streets of Copacabana, I decided to go out to recharge my phone card. However,\
  \ March brings heavy rains and floods that are notorious to the beach-side neighborhoods\
  \ of Rio. When the streets flood, you have two choices: stay inside, or dance through\
  \ the submerged streets barefoot, carioca style. When I reached the lobby of my\
  \ walk-up apartment, which I shared with a young French woman, the water had risen\
  \ so high that the lobby floor was also submerged. Undeterred, I waded out into\
  \ the streets. I pretended not to notice little bits of garbage idly floating past\
  \ me, or the blackness of the water as it reflected the city lights. But by the\
  \ third block was forced to turn back as the water came above my knees.\n\tI had\
  \ left my roommate Alice at home: a precarious choice, since our door could not\
  \ be unlocked from the inside. She was waiting patiently inside for me to return.\
  \ Our lock was so ancient, that as I went to unlock the door, the key snapped in\
  \ half. Suddenly, there was no way to open the door. Unsure of what to do, the irony\
  \ of the situation began to dawn on me. I, with my feeble Portuguese, was locked\
  \ out, while Alice, who spoke almost fluently, was trapped inside. Surely the roles\
  \ should have been reversed-- but it was up to me to find a locksmith, on a Sunday\
  \ night, while the streets of Copacabana were flooded. \n\tSpeaking through the\
  \ letter opener on the door, Alice and I decided on the best course of action. While\
  \ she called the landlord, I ran down to the lobby and knocked on the porter\u2019\
  s door. Our building\u2019s attendant was an intimidating young woman from the Northeast,\
  \ named Analine, who spoke in a dialect that was difficult to understand. I was\
  \ not exactly eager to ask for her help. \n\tI had to knock several times before\
  \ she answered, her tired eyes squinting in the light of the hallway. Clearly irritated,\
  \ she was about to shut the door in my face. I quickly stammered out an explanation,\
  \ which drew a blank look from Analine. With an exaggerated sigh, she opened the\
  \ door and let me into her kitchen, much smaller than my own. I sat on one of two\
  \ plastic folding chairs while she called every locksmith in the phone book. She\
  \ toyed with her dark hair absently, clearly less concerned than I was. After the\
  \ last call, she turned to me and said: \u201CAgora, esperamos.\u201D Now, we wait.\
  \ We sat there in uncomfortable silence for quite awhile. Perhaps sensing my impatience,\
  \ she removed a pan from the oven and placed it on the table in front of me. It\
  \ was p\xE3o de queijo, cheese-bread. \u201CMeu favorito!\u201D I told her. My favorite!\
  \ After that, we both relaxed and chatted idly, rarely understanding the other but\
  \ somehow finding kinship over the little Brazilian pastries. The locksmith took\
  \ several hours to arrive, but I learned something from Analine that night which\
  \ calmed my anxiety: rir para n\xE3o chorar. To laugh is to not cry. It is a Brazilian\
  \ saying that prescribes laughter in the face of crisis. \n\tBy the time my roommate\
  \ was freed, I discovered the importance of the carefree carioca way: sometimes,\
  \ the best course of action is to wait. We enjoyed several cervejas with Analine\
  \ that night, a connection that would have never occurred were it not for a decrepit\
  \ lock, the floods of March, and a healthy dose of helplessness."
