Text: "It was almost summer, but the hot weather was in the highest point in Singapore.\
  \ For me, it was not the first time in Asia, and for him, it would be his first\
  \ and greatest adventure. We were co-workers who won a challenge at work to go to\
  \ the other side of the world. We had never met before, until departure\u2019s day.\
  \  He was a shy and methodical person, everything was under his control and I was\
  \ a curious person who used to be a solo traveler.\nWe arrived at the airport and\
  \ we felt the Jasmin smell in our noses. We were at what passengers consider to\
  \ be the best Airport in the world. I could not imagine that every time that I felt\
  \ this smell, it would remind me of good memories. \n\nBesides the Jasmin, I remember\
  \ the pandan and durian smell all over the city. By the way, eating durian was an\
  \ interesting experience: due to the smell, the government prohibited eating this\
  \ fruit at closed spaces, so we had to go at a local Market to try it. Neither of\
  \ us liked it, but it was still funny.\nActually, having a dinner in Asia with someone\
  \ who had never tried another dish besides rice and beans was like playing my favorite\
  \ song to my favorite person. We were at Chjimes, a local venue with international\
  \ restaurants and good concerts. However, even there I had to insist that we should\
  \ try the local food for our first night, so that\u2019s what we chose. I forgot\
  \ to say that Asian food is spicy...he was hot and red. I made a historic explanation\
  \ about war and how it influenced the food culture. His eyes were shining as he\
  \ looked at me with attention. I was smiling because it was the first time I was\
  \ sharing such experience with someone. It\u2019s true when they say that food can\
  \ bring people closer.\n This colorful food that we were tasting holds Singapore\u2019\
  s identity: a multicultural city where you can find Malaysian, Chinese, Indonesian,\
  \ Thai people... It looks like each piece of Asia meets in Singapore. You can see\
  \ it at their gardens, with different kinds of flowers and plants. They say that\
  \ Gardens represent their people. Curious fact: even with all these gardens, Singapore\
  \ has been importing water from Malaysia. The water that they have is not good for\
  \ consumption. So they use it to keep the city brighter at night. Everybody who\
  \ goes there can see the light show in each tourist spot around the Marina Bay.\n\
  Our second night, we were looking for Marina Bay. I would like to go to the sky\
  \ bar, but he said that he had fear of heights. While Trying to convince him to\
  \ go higher, I decided to walk by. I like to get lost and find new places... So\
  \ he followed me. We walked by the Clarke Quay... and once again, we saw the colorful\
  \ and blinding lights around the river. It was crowded with young and drunk people\
  \ who were enjoying the happy hour, so we decided to walk further. Then we found\
  \ Gardens by the bay out. I confess I\u2019m not a good trip planner but I remembered\
  \ that these gardens were a must-go attraction and that there was a light show at\
  \ 9 p.m. We tried to buy the tickets, but unfortunately it was sold-out. We then\
  \ decide to go back to the hotel resigned that wasn\u2019t our night. \nOn our way\
  \ to the subway station, we were surprised by the gardens\u2019 by the bay experience\
  \ of music and light. The lights were dancing between the supertrees grove while\
  \ the song was playing in our ears. I started to cry. It was like a dream coming\
  \ true for both of us. He was splitting his attention between the colorful dancing\
  \ lights and me. We never spoke about this moment, but we know what we felt. We\
  \ were a perfect team: I had what he needed and he was everything that I missed.\
  \ At that point, I understood what it means when they say that happiness is only\
  \ real when we share it. Singapore will be in our memories forever."
