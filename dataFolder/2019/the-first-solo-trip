Text: "My backpack was firmly shut and held together by what then looked like flimsy\
  \ pieces of string. My travel clothes hung loosely on my body as I stood up and\
  \ picked up both of my bags. I could feel the weight pulling me down and the heat\
  \ of the London summer made me sweat profusely.\n\nIt was time to go. \n\nEverything\
  \ was ready. Passport. Itinerary. Phone. Charger. Yet I couldn\u2019t shake the\
  \ feeling of dread as I slowly locked my flat. It was difficult to process. I had,\
  \ after all, been looking forward to this trip for years. Why did the next 12 weeks\
  \ suddenly seem a mistake? I knew what I was leaving behind - a broken heart, a\
  \ past with no future - but not knowing what lay ahead was a lot more terrifying.\
  \ But it was the only escape. The only way to go. So I got in the lift and started\
  \ to make my way to the airport.\n\nThe journey was awful. I could feel how both\
  \ tourists and fellow Londoners observed me cautiously. Slightly overweight, carrying\
  \ two backpacks - one of which was almost bigger than me - and on the verge of tears,\
  \ I must have been a sight to see. To add insult to injury, I  worried I smelled.\
  \ \n\nAirport. Checked in my bag. I stretched my sore shoulders as I felt the relief\
  \ of not carrying 15kg extra. I vaguely remember the airline staff being nice. Security.\
  \ Immigration control. I called him. I shouldn\u2019t have. We still talked for\
  \ almost an hour. Afterwards, I cried. \n\nRoaming for hours around an airport can\
  \ feel relieving. There\u2019s nothing to do, and no excuse to stress. In those\
  \ moments you just\u2026 are. You have to wait. There\u2019s no choice. I questioned\
  \ once more whether I was making the right decision. Again, I decided to stick to\
  \ the plan. \u201CIt\u2019s only three months\u201D, I told myself.\n\nI looked\
  \ for solace in my notebooks. I tried to write yet the words wouldn\u2019t come\
  \ out. My flight was called. I silently prayed for the flight attendants to not\
  \ let me in. For something to be wrong with my visa. But through I went.\n\nThat\u2019\
  s when it happened. I remembered when in the movies from my childhood someone would\
  \ utter the name of my destination with reverence and nostalgia as if they were\
  \ longing for an unattainable home. India.\n\nI was on my way to India. \n\nAlone.\n\
  \nFinally. \n\nI\u2019m used to planes. Living far away from my family, but near\
  \ enough, means I spend much of my time flying back and forth. I knew to watch some\
  \ movies. To read my book. I made small talk with my seating partner and silently\
  \ judged his treatment of onboard staff. I nodded off. We landed after what seemed\
  \ an eternity. I stepped into Delhi\u2019s airport feeling disoriented and exhausted.\
  \ I was held for a bit longer than other travellers at passport control. \u201C\
  I\u2019m being sent back,\u201D I thought. This time there was no eagerness in my\
  \ mind. \u201CI\u2019ve gotten this far\u201D, I silently begged, \u201Cplease,\
  \ let me stay\u201D. \n\nOnce again I made it without an incident. I stepped into\
  \ Arrivals to find the shuttle that would take me to my hotel. The heat India\u2019\
  s July hit me with an unexpected force. I was covered in sweat, my mouth felt dry.\
  \ I listened to accents around me that were familiar yet foreign. \n\nThe barren\
  \ landscape of the motorway gave way to streets full of life. I saw urban scenes\
  \ which appeared to have always been in my memory. Just another city, with the same\
  \ infrastructures, the same behaviours, but so different that it was hard to process.\
  \ New smells, new sounds, new faces. The shuttle whizzed through a maze of alleyways\
  \ while I, hungrily looking through the window, took everything in.\n\nAnd then,\
  \ we were there. I met my tour mates and started bonding over experiences and our\
  \ curiosity. It\u2019s funny how you can become so close so quickly when you\u2019\
  re in a different country. Bags safely in a hotel room, and three tourists taking\
  \ a tentative step into the streets of Delhi. A leap into the unknown."
