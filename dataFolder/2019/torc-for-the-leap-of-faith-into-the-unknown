Text: "Standing on top of a solid rock amidst the romantic, tree-shaded, insurmountable\
  \ flowing waters of the TORC waterfall in the town of Killarney besides the Killarney\
  \ National Park, in the kingdom of Kerry in Ireland, and eyes glowing with hopes\
  \ and dreams for a loving and happy future; this moment in time, feels like a d\xE9\
  j\xE0 vu moment bringing links of past, present and the future in one moment. \n\
  Seemingly my own little personal moment of enlightenment, considering that enlightened\
  \ seers see the past, present and the future at the same time. \nTo add to the beauty\
  \ of the moment, there is my beloved standing high up on the side landing of the\
  \ waterfall making an effort to capture into his camera, the very state of my joy\
  \ and ecstasy in this very moment.\nThe irony of fate though, until today, I never\
  \ bothered checking the name of the waterfall\u2019s picture; the source of inspiration\
  \ to not give up and to make continuous efforts to make my way through the rocks\
  \ of hindrances in my life.\nIn May 2016, I took a leap of faith to come to Ireland;\
  \ with a purpose to peep into my beloved\u2019s world, Ireland. So, the focus was\
  \ to visit and enjoy few places; imbibing vibes and rhythm; diving into the cultural\
  \ heritage and history; connecting to the roots and heart of the place and culture.\n\
  Filled with hopes and dreams, I reached Dublin in the late evening, where my beloved,\
  \ wearing his saffron/Geru clothes was waiting to take me to his place in Tralee,\
  \ in the kingdom of Kerry. Further, I felt warmly welcomed by Ireland when I saw\
  \ the saffron dusky hues covering the sky; as an affirmation for amazing experiences.\
  \ Interestingly, here the sun can be visible as late as 11 pm at night and the hues\
  \ of dawn covers the skies again from 4.30 am.\nIreland appears as the physical\
  \ manifestation of Mother Nature in her full glory; a land offering experiences\
  \ of all four seasons in one day or even shorter spans of time. Before one can hold\
  \ the beauty of a moment in their eyes or the camera, it is transitioned into the\
  \ next beautiful scenery.\nWhile native Irish people embraced the summer sunshine\
  \ in their bright and colorful shorts, I had a few layers of clothing; when my body\
  \ was adapting to Irish summer of 12-25 Celsius; feeling like winters against Indian\
  \ summer of 35-45 Celsius. The styles of houses, the ways of living in Ireland,\
  \ all felt like a different world; albeit a promise land in the embrace of the beloved.\
  \ Like a small child, I felt the need to be told about everything pertaining to\
  \ living here. \nHowever, the vibe, rhythm and cultural heritage of these two materially\
  \ contrasting societies of India and Ireland are very similar. Ancient Irish, Celtic,\
  \ Druids and Pagan cultures have resemblances to Hindu Sanatan Dharma. Gaelic words\
  \ find similarities with words in Sanskrit. I was also told that Ireland was situated\
  \ near the equator previously; indicating some ties between the two cultures.\n\
  A lot has happened since that moment in TORC waterfall. I could still feel that\
  \ moment, filling me with gratitude, affirming clich\xE9 sayings of \u2018Destiny\
  \ and its mysterious ways\u2019, while I am basking in the beauty and blessings\
  \ of the place. \nBeing a science graduate, I notice an amazing metaphorical and\
  \ analogical correlation in the concept of the Torque in Physics and the TORC waterfall\
  \ picture in my life. TORC spelled as Torque in physics represents the twisting\
  \ force that tends to cause rotation. Interesting enough this TORC waterfall has\
  \ been the similar twisting force of faith and inspirations in my life helping me\
  \ navigate through the rocks of life.\nThe fated visit of an Indian girl to Ireland;\
  \ her first ever air flight before; executed with all administrative formalities\
  \ of Visa and bookings. Only the TORC force of inspiration and faith could devise\
  \ such endeavors. All I could feel was a rejuvenated TORC force assuring beautiful\
  \ destinations and experiences to enrich my soul. I hope to keep on exploring, experiencing\
  \ and expressing my being through this school of life in the process of evolving\
  \ into my highest potential."
