Text: "I\u2019d like to tell you about the unforgettable trip in Italy which I made\
  \ in September of 2017. I participated in International Workshop organized by Regional\
  \ Institute of European Studies of Friuli-Venezia-Giulia Region and bringing together\
  \ twenty one young people from various parts of Europe. One must mention that it\
  \ was an excellent experience which gifted me a lot of new friends, indelible impressions\
  \ and vivid recollections! I had a chance to live in one of the most beautiful cities\
  \ of Friuli-Venezia-Giulia - Pordenone which is famous for being a hometown of the\
  \ major representative of Friulian Renessaince, the painter Giovanni Antonio de\
  \ Sacchis called Pordenone. This ancient city is situated on the board of the river\
  \ Noncello, in the heart of Friuli. During the Workshop I\u2019ve visited the other\
  \ amazing cities and towns of the magnificent Friuli-Venezia-Giulia Region including\
  \ the Regional capital Trieste, Udine, Gorizia etc. I\u2019ve to tell that I admired\
  \ all the places which I\u2019ve discovered during my stay in Friuli and each of\
  \ them has a special place in my heart and my soul. During the days passed in Friuli\
  \ I\u2019ve met a lot of local residences which were very hospitable, gentle and\
  \ kind. The communication with them and the lessons of Italian language organized\
  \ in the framework of the Workshop helped me to improve my knowledge of Italian\
  \ language, Italian culture and Italian Cuisine. I could also amplify my network\
  \ of connections which could be useful for me in the future life. I hope so much\
  \ to return one day in the marvelous Friuli-Venezia-Giulia Region which I miss very\
  \ much and to visit again all the places and people which I knew thanks to this\
  \ fantastic voyage."
