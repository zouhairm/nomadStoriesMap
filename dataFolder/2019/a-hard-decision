Text: "A Hard Decision\nIt was a shiny Thursday afternoon in Dubai, United Arab Emirates.\
  \  Located in the Arabian Peninsula, I didn\u2019t expect anything more than a bright\
  \ sunshine. Dubai is known to be a place with year round \u2013 sunshine at least\
  \ so I read. Such a unique destination to choose I thought. This is a city that\
  \ attracts large numbers of tourist because it\u2019s a cosmopolitan. In my opinion\
  \ this city attracts a large number of tourist probably because of the ease of getting\
  \ a Tourist Visa. As I walked along with my husband struggling with handling our\
  \ toddler and the baggage at the airport I fantasized.  I can\u2019t wait to see\
  \ amongst others, the iconic Burj Khalifa (Tallest building in the world) with an\
  \ 829.8 m height! And the Burj Arab (built on an artificial Island) one of the most\
  \ luxurious and expensive hotel in the world.  I came out of fantasy when I saw\
  \ a man approach I and my family abruptly. \u201CHello\u201D! He said warmly. \u201C\
  Are you here on a visit?\u201D He asked. We told him we arrived to stay as residents\
  \ for two years. The look on his face was a surprise. He gave us a free ticket to\
  \ a dhow cruise dinner at the creek. He told us to expect a romantic experience\
  \ with fascinating lights from the creek and good food, music and entertainment.\
  \ We appreciated his kind gesture and continued to move towards the car park. But\
  \ the surprise on his face got me thinking\u2026\u2026 \n\n  My hubby and I decided\
  \ we should take a break out of our Country for the first time. We wanted something\
  \ different, an unusual experience and may be a greener pasture. The question was\
  \ \u201Cwhere do we go?\u201D after surfing the net and reading about so many countries\
  \ their culture, attractions, economy, Immigration policies etc., we decided to\
  \ settle down for Dubai. We\u2019ve never been there. All the information we had\
  \ were not first hand. But we decided to take a risk. One thing got us more confident\
  \ to move. It is a home to over a hundred Nationalities. Arabs, Asians, Africans,\
  \ Americans, Europeans and others. That shows a level of tolerance.  Thinking as\
  \ an Accountant, I wanted the move because it\u2019s an income tax free economy!\
  \  With the high rise buildings and world class structures that is hardly seen anywhere\
  \ else in the world, I guess this was the reason my hubby who is an Architect wanted\
  \ to explore this place. He would like to build his career in a challenging environment.\
  \ He wanted something more than the ordinary.\nA taxi parked. The driver helped\
  \ with our baggage and drove us down to the hotel where we would stay till we make\
  \ payments for a rented apartment. The drive was a long one from airport to Radisson\
  \ Blu hotel in Deira, Dubai.  Why Deira? My Hubby asked me when I was making the\
  \ hotel bookings. It\u2019s Deira because I read it up that\u2019s where a general\
  \ market is located. There you can get almost everything at very cheap prices. Travelers\
  \ and business people flood in large numbers to Deira market. We can expect to see\
  \ the gold souk. he ultimate destination for jewelry lovers. More importantly, I\
  \ also heard we can get our local dishes served at very cheap prices. I can\u2019\
  t wait to settle down and begin to explore. \n\nFinally we arrived at the hotel\
  \ and one of the new things we have discovered since we arrived in the Country was\
  \ that we had to pay for the taxi fare from a meter reader. There\u2019s no form\
  \ of bargaining or argument. Just pay whatever the meter reads. I guess I liked\
  \ the idea though. At least, there will be no form of cheating or brawling. The\
  \ magnificent hotel structure, the warm welcome from the hotel staffs and the neat\
  \ and fascinating hotel room made my day. The call for prayer woke us up the next\
  \ day at the early hour of the day. Welcome to Dubai. I told myself. I do not know\
  \ what the future holds for me and my family here; but I hope for the best as we\
  \ start up a new life."
