Text: "The site was spectacular, just as I had expected it to be: jungle covered stones\
  \ and incredible views over the tree-covered mountains and valleys below. I was\
  \ at Ku\xE9lap, a Chachapoya fortress in northern Peru. But, what I had forgotten\
  \ when planning my visit is that my body and altitude are not friends. I was already\
  \ feeling oddly tired and the afternoon headache that often hits me at a high altitude\
  \ was starting to settle in, making the thought of hiking the 10kms down to the\
  \ next village highly unappealing. \n\nI had hired a local guide to show me around\
  \ the site and, noticing my fatigue, she offered to put me up in her guesthouse.\
  \ I happily accepted her offer and my stay with her has come to be what I most remember\
  \ about my visit to Ku\xE9lap. That night gave me a glimpse into a life that was\
  \ the furthest removed from my own that I had ever witnessed. \n\nMy host led me\
  \ away from the archaeological site along a short path through the bushy vegetation\
  \ at the base of the site. We soon entered her yard and I caught my first glimpse\
  \ of her house, set in a yard of muddy grass surrounded by short trees above which\
  \ I could still see the stone walls surrounding the ancient fortress. The house\
  \ was a series of mud-walled rooms organized around a central courtyard. There were\
  \ a few small farm animals and pets hanging around.   \n\nMy host was very welcoming\
  \ and that evening, refusing my help, she invited me to talk with her in the kitchen\
  \ while she prepared dinner. The kitchen was a small room, at one end, there was\
  \ a table and benches, all painted white. We sat at the other end, where there was\
  \ a grill on the floor. I sat on a small stool, while she broke and placed branches\
  \ under the grill in order to maintain the fire that would boil the water for cooking.\
  \ As she tended to the fire, and then to the preparation of the potatoes that it\
  \ would cook, we talked. She told me that she had nine children, of which only three\
  \ still lived with her. \n\nThere were a few animals roaming around the yard and\
  \ some came into the room while we were talking. One was an enormous puffy chow,\
  \ it\u2019s puffy white hair contrasted with the setting. She explained that one\
  \ of her sons, who lived in Lima, had sent it to them as he did not have the time\
  \ and space to take care of it in the city. It had now visibly found a loving home.\n\
  \nDespite all of the small holes in the wall, the smoke from the fire was filling\
  \ the room, making it hard for me to breath. While it did not seem to bother my\
  \ host, who must have been accustomed to it, I had to politely exit a few times\
  \ in order to catch a few breaths of fresh air. \n\nWhen dinner was ready, I sat\
  \ at the table with her and 3 of her children who still lived with her. Our meal\
  \ was a soup with noodles, potato and a bit of boiled egg, accompanied by bread.\
  \ Maybe it was just my tired altitude-stricken body, but it was delicious. At the\
  \ table, I was invited into their conversation. I learnt that her older son had\
  \ spent the day helping some neighbours (not that I could see any) build a wall\
  \ for their house. They had been making the same kind of mud walls which now surrounded\
  \ us at the dinner table. It was hard work, and he would get up early the next day\
  \ to do the same.\n\nAs for me, I went to bed amazed at the lives that I had just\
  \ had a peek into. As I lay in my bed, I could hear music being played on a mobile\
  \ phone, coming from the area where the family lived: the sound of teenagers relaxing,\
  \ something familiar. Finally, I drifted off into a comfortable sleep."
