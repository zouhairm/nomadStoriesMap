Text: "Please don\u2019t call it my Eat, Pray, Love. While it\u2019s perfectly possible\
  \ my story involves divorce, emotional encounters with elephants, and overindulging\
  \ on cheese in southern Europe - I am not a cliche. This is not a movie. And I did\
  \ not fall in love with Javier Bardem.\n\nWhen I set sail for as far away as possible\
  \ from the dullness of depression, I had no idea I\u2019d find true happiness again\
  \ on a walking path through a rice field in Ubud, Bali. A path illuminated by thousands\
  \ of fireflies dancing to the rhythm of the frogs and Gamelan music reverberating\
  \ across the ravine and onto my porch. \n\nIt began with a one-way ticket to Chiang\
  \ Mai, Thailand, a hostel booked for two nights only, and a symbolic exodus from\
  \ San Francisco, my marriage, and a box containing the ashes of my beloved dog.\
  \ I hoped jumping into the abyss of unplanned chaos on the other side of the world\
  \ might shake me back to life. I was scared shitless. \n\nI wasn\u2019t sure where\
  \ I\u2019d go, but there was one place in all of Thailand calling to me with an\
  \ unexplainable force of wonder, whispering in my ear alone. The travelers I met\
  \ in Chiang Mai hadn\u2019t heard of Chiang Dao. And that\u2019s where I was headed,\
  \ to find What Tham Pha Plong, an ethereal Buddhist temple perched on the side of\
  \ Doi Chiang Dao, Thailand\u2019s third highest mountain. At 2,225 meters, it towers\
  \ dramatically over Chiang Dao. And when the sun sets behind it after a misty mountain\
  \ rain, you might feel as though you\u2019ve found utopia.\n\nWith reigning title\
  \ as one of the world\u2019s most visited countries, Thailand can leave the impression\
  \ of being overrun. Chiang Dao is the ultimate exception. So after two days of relaxation,\
  \ I awoke anew, and set off to find What Tham Pha Plong.\n\nAt the end of the road,\
  \ through a gateway into the Chiang Dao Wildlife Sanctuary, I entered sacred space\
  \ - a mountain monastery where the crowds fade away, and the only sounds remaining\
  \ are from a canopy filled with birds. Enchanting, otherworldly; it\u2019s a song\
  \ from the jungle, welcoming you to begin your ascent of 510 stairs to the top.\
  \ I set a meditative pace, silently absorbing teachings of the Buddha posted on\
  \ hundreds of plaques along the way, while embracing a childlike bliss in exchanging\
  \ smiles with the monks passing by. \n\nThe reward from the top of the golden chedi\
  \ is a never-ending view of the jungle. From here, it feels as though you\u2019\
  re halfway up Doi Chiang Dao, and it seems quite possible nothing will ever be the\
  \ same again. \n\nWhat largely makes Chiang Dao so captivating is how it\u2019s\
  \ not overwhelmed by tourism. It\u2019s a land for nature lovers, birders, artists,\
  \ and yes, even foodies. The area is most known for its top tourist attraction,\
  \ What Tham, or the Chiang Dao Cave. Here, a guide with a lantern leads you into\
  \ the dark, dank depths of the cave. It\u2019s bizarre and incredible, like Tom\
  \ Robbins meets Buddhist Thailand, with a whole new level of humidity - one without\
  \ fresh air. I saved this adventure for last, when my new German backpacker friends\
  \ joined me at the Chiang Dao Nest. We hiked, soaked riverside in the Pong Arng\
  \ hot springs down the road, and enjoyed incredible meals at both the Nest (Western),\
  \ and the Nest II (Thai). Because at the end of the road, in a romantic gem of northern\
  \ Thailand, the Chiang Dao Nest is home to an award-winning chef, who agrees that\
  \ a fabulous culinary experience has a place next to one of the most ethereal temples\
  \ in Thailand. \n\nI soon continued onward to circle the globe with spontaneous,\
  \ one-way tickets. I most certainly did eat lamb cooked on a spit during the Greek\
  \ Orthodox Easter procession in historic Plaka, Athens. And oh how I prayed, so\
  \ many steps of the way. But the love I found, on a walking path through a rice\
  \ field, serenaded by frogs, remained with me, and was for no one else but me. \n\
  \n\u201CWhen you realize how perfect everything is you will tilt your head back\
  \ and laugh at the sky.\u201D\n\u2014 Buddha"
