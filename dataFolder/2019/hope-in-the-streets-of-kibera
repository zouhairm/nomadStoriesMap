Text: "It did not take long for me to realize the curiosity was mutual. Dark brown\
  \ eyes met mine as I rounded the raw-edged corner that lead me to yet another narrow\
  \ alleyway. \n\nIt was midday in Nairobi as we weaved through the streets of Kibera\
  \ \u2013 the largest slum in Africa, and one of the largest in the world. Accompanied\
  \ by a local guide, we made our way through an entanglement of buildings where approximately\
  \ two and a half million people called home. The small mud shacks were built right\
  \ on top of each other as one corrugated tin roof ran into the next. Most without\
  \ electricity or running water, the absence of amenities drew the dwellers of Kibera\
  \ out of their settlements and into community as they shared what little they did\
  \ have access to. Fruit stands, hairdressers and metal welders set up shop wherever\
  \ they could find an inch of space. We sauntered methodically through the dirt-packed\
  \ lanes, stopping to exchange words with the store owners as we took it all in.\
  \ \n\nThere was so much to take in.\n\nIt did not take long for me to realize the\
  \ curiosity was mutual. The people of Kibera were just as captivated by our presence\
  \ as we were with theirs. Their way of life horrified me and humbled me at the same\
  \ time and this complicated paradox followed me well past my visit. \n\nThe orphanage\
  \ floors rattled to life as a hundred tiny feet stomped unanimously to the same\
  \ beat. The space was transformed as the children excitedly came together to perform\
  \ a rehearsed dance number for their small audience. My heart strings were tugged\
  \ at when a young girl closed the program with a poem about Kenya that she recited\
  \ from memory. She stood there confidently delivering every word with enough emotion\
  \ to shake you to the very core. \n\nWe handed out clothing, snacks and smiles.\
  \ Cautious yet gratified, the little ones filed by, quietly accepting all we had\
  \ to offer them.\n\nMy heart felt like a lump in my chest upon first setting foot\
  \ in this place. This place where sixty percent of Nairobi\u2019s population inhabits\
  \ only six percent of the land. Yet, instead of sadness I was met with hope. I was\
  \ greeted with grace and I was welcomed in as an equal. I was shown firsthand the\
  \ power of hospitality and the lengths that loyalty can go. \n\nAmidst the poverty\
  \ and the poor living conditions, I was taken aback by the people. By the resiliency\
  \ they started each day with and the courage to persevere through ill-fated circumstances.\
  \ \n\nI will never forget the look on his face when he waved us over to his shopfront.\
  \ His smile immediately put me at ease as he invited us into his home, gesturing\
  \ with animation. We barely fit inside the one-roomed structure where he and his\
  \ wife shared a bed with their only child. The bedroom was the living room, the\
  \ kitchen and the living quarters, which was attached to his store where he made\
  \ his livelihood. \n\nAnd his pride was overwhelming. \n\nThe tour did not last\
  \ long. It wasn\u2019t much, but it was everything. A brief surveyance of his home\
  \ and you could see all he had ever worked for. A moment in his presence and you\
  \ could understand how he continued to persist in order to provide for the ones\
  \ he treasured most. I have never felt love as I felt it on that day, crammed into\
  \ a mud shack with someone who fully understood what it meant to be a good neighbour.\
  \ \n\nIt is experiences like these when I am reminded of the tenderness of the human\
  \ heart and the way it continuously disregards space and time; driven solely by\
  \ its longing for connection. Midday in Nairobi I experienced sadness and I experienced\
  \ brokenness. I experienced love. I experienced humility and I experienced hope\
  \ in the most unlikely of places."
