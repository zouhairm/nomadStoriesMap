Text: "If your heart aches for adventures and your soul yearns for solitude, then\
  \ you must visit the quaint and beautiful hill station called Dharamsala! The town\
  \ is nestled in the snow-capped mountains of Himachal Pradesh and can be visited\
  \ all around the year. Located in the foothills of Dhauladar ranges, the town offers\
  \ a blend of rich cultural diversity and mesmerising scenic views. Owing its popularity\
  \ to its famous handicrafts, handmade carpets and garments, and the Dharamsala has\
  \ now become the cultural and traditional hub of Himachal Pradesh.\_\n\nI've visited\
  \ many beautiful places in this city. Tibet Museum is the first place. In a small\
  \ building in the complex of Dalai Lama's temple, you'll find the Tibet Museum.\
  \ The pristine white interiors are sparingly filled with photographs and Tibetan\
  \ artefacts. More than a museum, the Tibet Museum is a library of facts, documents,\
  \ videos, installations and objects related with the Chinese occupation of Tibet.\
  \ As you enter you'll be taken through the grim but fascinating methods the Chinese\
  \ used to intimidate the Tibetan people. Huge sepia tinted photographs tell you\
  \ how Dalai Lama escaped from Tibet into India dressed like a soldier, the Chinese\
  \ soldiers stationed at the Lhasa border and many more poignant scenes. A video\
  \ made by a documentary filmmaker takes you through the torment the Tibetan freedom\
  \ fighters live through even today. On the second floor you'll see images of optimism.\
  \ Like the first group of people who came to India from Lhasa.\n\nThe second place\
  \ is Dalai Lama Temple. The temple and the Dalai Lama complex is attached with eachother.\
  \ The temple has 2 floors with ample amount of place for the visitors to sit, relax\
  \ and perform meditation. The whole complex is painted beautifuly with spiritual\
  \ statues and paintings.\n\nThe third places, St. John Church.\nSt. John Church\
  \ in Dharamshala is also known as St. John Church in Wilderness. It is an Anglican\
  \ Church which is dedicated to Saint John. This church was constructed in the year\
  \ 1852, situated at Forsyth Ganj. It is built in Neo-Gothic architectural style\
  \ and features Belgian stained-glass windows that were donated by Lady Elgin (Mary\
  \ Louisa Lambton), wife of Lord Elgin.\_The church is on the way to McLeod Ganj.\
  \ It is situated amidst lush trees and grass. There is a cemetery nearby which makes\
  \ it kinda spooky. The Church has dark and cold interiors. I visited this place\
  \ when it was foggy and of course so cold inside. I would recommend you to wear\
  \ warm clothes. A peaceful place to visit!\n\nNext to the fourth places, HPCA Stadium.\n\
  What would it be like to watch an exciting match of cricket from a stadium at an\
  \ elevation of 4110 feet? Prided as the \"most attractive ground in India\" the\
  \ Himachal Pradesh Cricket Association is also one of the highest international\
  \ ground in the world.\_This stadium was built in the year 2003 with a capacity\
  \ of 25000 spectators. As a matter of fact, the Dalai Lama and the Tibetan government\
  \ in exile resides here and the Dalai Lama is also said to have witnessed some of\
  \ the IPL matches. The first one-day international match was played here in 2013.\
  \ This venue is also the first of its kind in India to use ryegrass around the outfield.\
  \ With a stunning backdrop of the Dhauladar Mountains and several snow-capped Himalayan\
  \ ranges, one cannot have enough of both the scenic beauty and cricket, of course!\
  \ It is, therefore, rightly said that if God played cricket, it would probably be\
  \ here!\n\nThe last places, Bhagsu Nag Waterfall\nThe majestic Bhagsu Waterfalls,\
  \ situated near the Bhagsu village, is one of the main attractions near McLeod Ganj\
  \ in the quaint state of Himachal Pradesh. Bhagsunag is a village situated about\
  \ 7000 feet above the sea level, which makes it a perfect location to enjoy the\
  \ beauty of a high-altitude spot.\_\nWhat a beautiful place nice to hang out, first\
  \ of all you have to physically active and fit for going there because you have\
  \ to climb the stairs for approximately 20 minutes. The water is crystal clear and\
  \ so chilled you will feel like heaven!"
