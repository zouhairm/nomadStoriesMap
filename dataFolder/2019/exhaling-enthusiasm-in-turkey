Text: "And\u2026lift up! I was ready for the 20 hours of travel ahead of me but certainly,\
  \ I wasn\u2019t ready for the experience that I was about to live.\nAfter a long\
  \ journey, I entered the city with the old fort. Hidden behind those walls there\
  \ were centuries of history and culture, I was in the fascinating city of Istanbul.\
  \ It was like no other place I had been before, with signs in a language that wasn't\
  \ remotely like mine and people talking in the rarest way. The sun was shining and\
  \ there was barely breeze, but despite the incredible heat of July, something urged\
  \ me to explore those streets. Outside, a European looking coffee shop stood next\
  \ to the entrance to an underground Roman cistern. I saw Egyptian monuments in front\
  \ of a new shopping mall and a majestic mosque that was right beside a barber shop.\
  \ Then I realized I was looking at the perfect combination of the ancient and the\
  \ modern. People of all races were strolling around in the paved streets. People\
  \ in shorts, people in burkas, people with turbans, people with hats. Tall, short,\
  \ old and young. Christians, Muslims, Jews, and atheists. Each person with a culture\
  \ so different and with its own an understanding of life, but that in this city\
  \ they appeared to have merged all into one. \nThe narrow streets led to the Grand\
  \ Bazar. I saw carpet shops, candy stores, hookas and lamps of every single color\
  \ and design. I saw perfectly placed tiles covering the ceiling and the walls. I\
  \ touched the soft and neatly woven carpets and tasted the typical apple tea and\
  \ the Turkish delights. I smelled the different species and the people's particular\
  \ odor. \u201CCompre! Kupiti! Buy! Anschaffen! Sat\u0131n almak!\u201D was all I\
  \ could hear from the yelling, enthusiastic sellers who were doing honor to the\
  \ place that has been for centuries a major venue for exchange. I could hear the\
  \ children laughing as they lined up in the ice-cream cart show, I could hear the\
  \ birds singing, but overall, I could hear the sound of the prayers from the megaphones\
  \ of the mosques, all at the same time, creating an ambiance of mystery and greatness.\n\
  I made my way down to the port and the smell of salt with fish and the crashing\
  \ of the waves with the rocks gave the ocean away before I could even see it. There\
  \ I thought of all of the histories of which those waters have been a witness through\
  \ the centuries. All the battles, all the great leaders, all the greatest cultures\u2026\
  \ just wondrous. \n\u201CWelcome to Topkapi\u201D were the words of our tour guide\
  \ as I entered the palace that served as home for the sultans in the golden years\
  \ of the Ottoman Empire. Beautiful, I thought, as I approached the main balcony.\
  \ Suddenly, my feet stopped moving and my eyes just got lost in the greatness before\
  \ me. The tips of the mosques shined like gold at the other side of the Bosphorus\
  \ Strait. The green trees and the white marble balcony rail contrasted with the\
  \ blue perfect sky and the deep blue of the ocean. My chest was filled with a warm\
  \ feeling of joy and happiness that I had never felt before. Like if I had been\
  \ there before\u2026 Out of nowhere, tears started falling down my face. I felt\
  \ so small, yet so big, I felt so privileged and humble. \u201CAre you all right?\u201D\
  \ my father asked with a worried face. \u201CBetter than ever\u201D I  answered\
  \ with complete honesty.\nUntil today, I don't know exactly what happened in that\
  \ majestic, perhaps magical city. Maybe something got into my eye and made me cry,\
  \ maybe I was just very sensible, maybe I got some kind of revelation or maybe I\u2019\
  m just a bit nuts\u2026 Still, whatever happened, I\u2019ll value and remember that\
  \ experience forever. Now, I just hope to continue to be crazy enough in order to\
  \ be marveled by the world around me. I only wish to find another place that makes\
  \ me exhale enthusiasm and surrender to beauty just like it happened that July,\
  \ in that balcony, in Istanbul."
