Text: "The city lights shining up at you from your tiny plane window give you your\
  \ first impression of this new country you are going to try calling home: there\u2019\
  s a lot of lights. Your mind wanders to all your family and friends back home, perfectly\
  \ content living their everyday life, a life you, not so long ago, were just as\
  \ happy fulfilling. You think of your mum and the partial grief you have caused\
  \ her by moving so far away but you reassure yourself that she knows it\u2019s simply\
  \ something that you have to do. Plus it gives her a good excuse to go and visit\
  \ a different part of the world. You consider your travellers backpack beneath you\
  \ in the luggage compartment of the plane and smile to yourself as you remember\
  \ how surprisingly easy it was to pack up your life, fill your luggage with 20kg\
  \ of travelling essentials and be prepared to have only a backpack full of possessions\
  \ with you for the foreseeable future. You remember conversations you had with friends\
  \ who had talked about living abroad but their priorities changed and life got in\
  \ the way. You wonder if they will regret not taking the leap when they had the\
  \ opportunity, knowing full well that the fear of regret at some point in your future\
  \ was a far bigger motivator in your decision than the fear of the unknown. \nYou\
  \ smile politely and answer seemingly endless questions from the customs officer,\
  \ justifying your reason for entering the country, the work you do and where you\
  \ will be staying, inwardly hoping that you\u2019ve done everything right and won\u2019\
  t be turned away before any of this adventure really begins.\nYou collect your luggage\
  \ and grimace at the weight as you swing your bag onto your back, perhaps at some\
  \ point you\u2019ll get used to carrying it.\nYou are inwardly bursting with excitement\
  \ as you sit on the tube, having heard dozens of horror stories about the temperature,\
  \ smell and general awkwardness of doing everything possible to not make eye contact\
  \ with any of your fellow passengers, but the novelty of it has you hooked.\nYou\
  \ spend the day just wandering the streets, marvelling at how it all looks exactly\
  \ how you imagined from photos and movies. The major landmarks crammed with tourists\
  \ but you know they are just as swept up in this city as you are. You cannot believe\
  \ how many people there are, the thought that the population of this city alone\
  \ is about a quarter of your home country population. You smirk as you think how\
  \ insignificant you appear amongst the masses but somehow feel validated in such\
  \ an encompassing city. \nYou excitedly gaze up at Big Ben from across the Thames\
  \ and are horror struck to see it covered in scaffolding. A quick Google search\
  \ tells you it\u2019s in the midst of a 4 year restoration project and you wonder\
  \ if perhaps you should have done a bit more research before arriving. \nYou\u2019\
  re asked countless times \u201CWhy would you want to leave Australia to move here?\u201D\
  \ which you respond with a laugh and a shrug, explaining how you just got bored\
  \ back home, plus the travel opportunities seem endless on this side of the world.\n\
  You think of back home often but not in regret or wishing you were back there. You\
  \ miss your friends and family but know that your constant pestering will at some\
  \ stage result in familiar visitors who you can excitedly show around your new backyard.\
  \ You have a list of places you simply must visit but quickly realise you probably\
  \ won\u2019t have enough time for everywhere, particularly when your \u2018countries\
  \ to return to\u2019 list starts creeping up on your \u2018countries to visit\u2019\
  \ list.\nYou know this huge life changing decision has opened up more doors and\
  \ will present more opportunities than you could ever imagine. \nYou know at times\
  \ it will be difficult and you will question it all, but when it\u2019s over and\
  \ you look back at it all, it won\u2019t be a decision that is regretted or taken\
  \ back for a second.\nIt\u2019s all in the life of someone living a working holiday\
  \ visa."
