Text: "I didn't mean to go to Paris again, it happened by accident; but then that's\
  \ what Paris does to you. Late night browsing on accomodation resulted in a 25 night\
  \ booking to Paris in an apartment with a balcony near Trocadero. I could not resist\
  \ the balcony. Twenty five nights in Paris sounded so romantic and maybe it would\
  \ be.\nWhat's a single gal to do on the loose in the City of Light, but swipe right.\
  \ And swipe I did. Galleries were seductive but French men even more so, I scored\
  \ myself two points for the double whammy, awesome hair AND a scarf. \nThe exotic\
  \ beckoned; a match with a French man with flowing locks; who cared if he smoked;\
  \ this was Paris after all. We met and he was exactly like his photo. The Palais\
  \ du Tokyo was an impressive venue for a date, so much better than a coffee which\
  \ is the usual Australian first date fare. His name was Zino, the art was fun with\
  \ little snails dotted on a sculpture and a fountain of breasts. How original and\
  \ how interesting. Over a wine in a pavement cafe we talked further, until I asked\
  \ him who he had holidayed with recently; \"my wife\" came the response. It was\
  \ adieu at that point but i had a wine to finish and as we parted I gave him a quick\
  \ kiss; it was Paris after all.\nMy next date was with a French man of a certain\
  \ age who again wanted to meet at the Palais du Tokyo, but this time was evening\
  \ and pre gallery he offered dinner. It could not have been more romantic; we were\
  \ chatting, drinking rose and it was all fairy lights and white linen tablecloths;\
  \ beautiful. At my shoulder the Eiffel Tower shone and did her magical twinkling\
  \ on the hour. It was pure romance. I would love to say that he swept me off my\
  \ feet but he decided to tell me about his HPV induced throat cancer and at that\
  \ point, lacking google or a medical opinion, i was thinking oh my goodness what\
  \ if he kisses me. My prince had turned into a frog and like with an \"it's too\
  \ risky I'm sorry\" I fled from the restaurant and vanished into a metro as fast\
  \ as my ballet flats could carry me.\nDate three was a lot more optimistic sounding;\
  \ he was American and a doctor; such a good catch that i was sure he would be a\
  \ fake. At least i would have my American in Paris. He flew in from Alaska and was\
  \ so badly delayed by his train that I sat by the pyramid outside the Louvre for\
  \ two hours using their WiFi to communicate with him on Hotmail ( which he turned\
  \ out to be ). He was tall, he was dark, he was handsome but who minds a cliche\
  \ at times like this. The attraction was instant. We walked by the Seine arm in\
  \ arm, we held hands, we kissed, and we talked. We dined; him with the English menu\
  \ and me trying to understand the French one. We drank wine of course, we walked\
  \ through the lovely courtyard of the Comedie Francais and back to his apartment.\
  \ He went pastry shopping in the morning whilst I brewed tea and he walked further\
  \ than intended for my escargot, and really nothing impresses a woman more than\
  \ a man who goes to extra effort for her pastry.\nOur days passed looking at art,\
  \ the stunning Nympheas in the Orangerie and the Picasso exhibition at the D'Orsay,\
  \ and wandering the streets stopping for coffee and kisses; we sat on the metal\
  \ chairs in the Tuileries gardens and fed the ducks.  We went up the Eiffel after\
  \ dark; is there any other time? Being kissed at the top of the Eiffel Tower should\
  \ happen to every woman once in her life (or twice). \nThere was no happy ending;\
  \ he ended up dating a Paris Opera singer and really who could compete with that?\
  \ Still, we had our moment and it will always be a fond memory for me and i hope\
  \ also for him. We'll always have Paris."
