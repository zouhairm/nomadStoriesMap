Text: "I had one foot on the clutch and the other hovered over the gas as the little\
  \ red Fiat rental rolled to a halt. I stole a glance at my passenger to determine\
  \ if it was a laugh or cry moment and after realizing it was neither, I hastily\
  \ cranked the ignition. \u201CHurry! We\u2019re in the middle of the road!\u201D\
  \ he exclaimed. \n\nI flashed a tight lipped smile at the three Italian businessmen\
  \ who were unmistakably chuckling at the American learning to drive a manual transmission.\
  \ Over the cobblestones we rattled, past gelaterias and leather shops until the\
  \ cobblestones turned to gravel and the town of Greve disappeared behind the hills\
  \ in the rear view mirror.\n\n\u201C Apartement in Winefarm\u201D the rental ad\
  \ read, \u201CImmersed in the nature of Chianti.\u201D As the automatic gate slid\
  \ open, a splendid scene was revealed. Endless rows of grapevines were divided by\
  \ helter-skelter squat stone walls. Every shade of green was represented in pines,\
  \ grasses, and vines. Farmhouses speckled the land. It was exactly as I imagined\
  \ my great grandparents\u2019 homeland. I could almost hear hollers from the adjoining\
  \ house- Nonna, undoubtedly wearing a faded apron dusted with flour, leaned out\
  \ the back door and waved a baguette like a white flag.\u201CKids, fresh pasta inside!\u201D\
  \ I snapped from my revery as the gate clunked into its open position. I swear I\
  \ heard the car sigh with relief as I pulled it into its parking spot.\n\nThe house\
  \ was charming from the outside- sandy stone outer walls, freshly washed red brick\
  \ steps, and iron lattice work surrounding the patio. But as we fumbled our bags\
  \ over the hearth, the back of my neck prickled. I looked around, expecting to find\
  \ something amiss. The three rooms were small and bare but as expected from the\
  \ photos. Yellow upholstered chair? Check. Gargantuan dining table? Check. Farmhouse\
  \ sink? Check. \u201CIt\u2019s\u2026 quaint\u201D I choked out.\n\nA bottle of wine\
  \ and block of cheese later, we sat on the patio watching the sunset. The moment\
  \ should have been purely serene. The arm of the man I loved was around me, cigarette\
  \ smoke wafted into the breeze, and spectacular reds scorched the sky. But instead\
  \ of savoring it, I fixated on my uneasiness. Later as I laid under the scratchy\
  \ bedspread waiting for sleep, I surveyed the bedroom again. All was in order.\n\
  \nBy morning, a lump rose in my throat and soon a river poured from my eyes. I pulled\
  \ on my scarf and rushed toward the myriad of greens for solace, leaving my bewildered\
  \ companion far behind. I trudged through knee high grasses, dodged towering vines,\
  \ and wove through clusters of trees wailing all the way. When my eyes finally dried\
  \ I took a deep breath of dewy morning air and looked around as if seeing my surroundings\
  \ for the first time that morning. I looked disapprovingly at my soaked pajama bottoms\
  \ and frowned at the disappearance of my scarf.\n\nAs I began trudging back to the\
  \ house, I mulled on an explanation for my experience. Thankfully, emotional outbursts\
  \ were out of character. On one hand, that meant there should be a logical explanation.\
  \ On the other hand, I worried, \u201CMaybe I\u2019m going insane?\u201D But as\
  \ the sun began to burn the mist off the fields, I recalled a conversation with\
  \ the \u201CApartement in Winefarm\u201D owner from the previous evening. As we\
  \ had bagged up our vineyard purchases, she chatted amiably about the history of\
  \ the apartment and of her late aunt who had lived out her last years there. Now,\
  \ as I stepped back into the drafty kitchen and shuddered again, I couldn\u2019\
  t help but continue to contemplate her aunt\u2019s demise.\n\nOur grand Italian\
  \ road trip continued without another tear. The \u201CApartement in Winefarm\u201D\
  \ experience will remain surreal in my memory for reasons completely outside my\
  \ expectations. Maybe late auntie thought I needed an emotional cleanse, or the\
  \ scene had just been too perfect for me not to spoil. But I still chuckle as I\
  \ imagine Nonna sipping her espresso and shaking her head sympathetically on that\
  \ misty morning as she watched my hysterics unfold."
