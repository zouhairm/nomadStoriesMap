Text: "I couldn\u2019t find a ride out of North Sydney, Nova Scotia and was hiking\
  \ through a wooded area looking for somewhere to set up camp. The sun had begun\
  \ to set and, with the wind blowing in off the ocean, it was colder than I thought\
  \ a summer night would be. With only a blanket and a hammock I was concerned about\
  \ the clouds that were coming in. Then, carried on the wind I heard the faint sound\
  \ of a fiddle. I remembered the advice a young artist named Jamie\u2019s gave me;\
  \ \u201CIf you ever hear music, you should follow it. It\u2019ll lead to a good\
  \ time.\u201D\nI trekked on and found myself down by the pier. There was a band\
  \ on a stage flanked with cars, their windows cracked so the people inside seeking\
  \ refuge could still hear the music. Benches created a semi-circle around the stage,\
  \ paint peeling from the salty ocean air.\nBetween songs an older woman sitting\
  \ on the bench turned to me and asked, \u201CWere you in Sydney Mines earlier today?\u201D\
  \n\t\u201CYes, where the museum is?\u201D\n\t\u201CI thought so. I was talking to\
  \ someone who said they saw a young man in Sydney Mines playing the\u2026ah\u2026\
  \u201D she motioned to the small bag at my side.\n\t\u201CUkulele?\u201D\n\t\u201C\
  That\u2019s it,\u201D she smiled. \u201CYou should go up and play a song.\u201D\n\
  \t\u201COh no, I only dabble,\u201D I blushed.\n\t\u201CCome on, it\u2019s just\
  \ for fun. They do a free show down here every night during the summer, though I\
  \ suppose tonight isn\u2019t very summery.\u201D The clouds still threatened rain.\
  \ \u201CSometimes they get big names, but usually it\u2019s a lot of local acts.\
  \ I\u2019m going on tomorrow night if you\u2019re around. I\u2019m Noreen,\u201D\
  \ she introduced herself. \u201CThe old guy on stage is Kevin, but I call him Willie\
  \ because he looks like Willie Nelson. The woman with the big guitar there is his\
  \ partner Rachel.\u201D\n\tI introduced myself and told her I was travelling coast\
  \ to coast across Canada. She told me about living in Sydney, growing up in the\
  \ area with thirteen siblings. She had been married three times, all of them happy\
  \ marriages, but she outlived each spouse.\n\tBy eleven the parking lot was empty\
  \ and the band was packing up. I got roped into helping Willie pack up his cargo\
  \ van with speakers and the PA system.\n\t\u201CWhere\u2019re you staying tonight?\u201D\
  \ Willie asked me as we hauled one of his giant speakers into the van.\n\t\u201C\
  I have no idea. I\u2019ve got a hammock so I\u2019ll probably just head back into\
  \ the forest and find a couple of trees to swing between.\u201D\n\t\u201CI don\u2019\
  t know if that\u2019s a good idea,\u201D Rachel said. \u201CIt\u2019s supposed to\
  \ rain tonight\u201D\n\t\u201CI\u2019m sure Willie can help you figure something\
  \ out,\u201D Noreen said.\n\tWillie looked around, his mind working. \u201CUse the\
  \ bandstand,\u201D he said finally. \u201CIt\u2019ll block the wind and the rain.\
  \ Here, help me move this.\u201D We laboured to push a bench deep into the corner.\
  \ \u201CUse that and nobody\u2019ll find you in here.\u201D\n\tWillie and Rachel\
  \ dove off in their cargo van but Noreen stuck around a bit longer. \u201CWould\
  \ you like something to eat? Here, let me get you something to eat.\u201D Never\
  \ one to turn down food, I followed her to her car. \u201CIt\u2019s not much but\
  \ it\u2019ll help you get by. I was visiting my sister today and we always buy a\
  \ bunch of sweets, but I can\u2019t eat most of them because I\u2019m diabetic.\
  \ I guess really I shouldn\u2019t eat any of them, but where\u2019s the fun in that?\u201D\
  \n\tShe handed me a bag and I looked inside to see cinnamon buns, some tarts, and\
  \ a cheese sandwich. Before she left for good she played a couple songs for me on\
  \ her Bodhran, a Celtic hand drum. \u201CI\u2019m sorry I couldn\u2019t offer you\
  \ a room for the night, but I\u2019ve got none to spare.\u201D\n\tI thanked her\
  \ for the bag of baked goods, telling her it was more than enough, and she left.\
  \ I settled into my little encampment for the night, safe against the wind and rain."
