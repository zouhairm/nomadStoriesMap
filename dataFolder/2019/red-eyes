Text: "When I was in Cuba I did not expect that people were having such a hard life\
  \ there and one day at the resort it was my last day and we went to have lunch.\
  \ The waitress came in and her eyes were bloodshot red and you could see that she\
  \ was really tired and she said was I\u2019m so sorry about my eyes I haven\u2019\
  t slept in a few days but sit down let me just get you guys plates and what would\
  \ you guys like to drink?  I was shocked because I couldn\u2019t believe someone\
  \ could be so tired that their eyes would be so red.  As soon as that happened I\
  \ felt a rush of just wanting to help anyone and everybody I had a small stash of\
  \ one dollar bills and I went around to every single employee working in the resort\
  \ and gave them a dollar when I came back I had left three dollars for her on the\
  \ table and she was crying her eyes out and I have never felt so much compassion\
  \ for a person. She honestly touched my soul because every person that I went and\
  \ gave whatever I could give I could see their face light up their eyes shine bright\
  \ after being tired all day it was the happiest day could be that day. I remember\
  \ she hugged me so tight and she said you are a friend you are my friend and that\
  \ day I decided everywhere I go I want to help and learn about the culture but also\
  \ the communities and the people that live there and find out ways to make their\
  \ lives easier"
