Text: "Argo \u2013 Fuck Yourself \u2013 Alan Arkin\u2019s famous dialogue from the\
  \ historical american drama film - Argo echoed in my mind as I touchdown on Riyadh\
  \ International Airport, Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. The atmosphere at the airport\
  \ took me to the climax of \u201CArgo\u201D wherein US embassy staff had a miraculous\
  \ escape from the clutches of Iranian officials in a planned coup. \n\nI was standing\
  \ perplexed in the immigration queue thinking if I have made the right decision?\
  \ Questioning my decision to visit \u201CAliyah\u201D an acquaintance who convinced\
  \ me to explore Riyadh along with her.  \n\nA stout middle-aged officer started\
  \ interrogating me in Arabic. I begged him to allow me to call Aliyah, as I could\
  \ only converse in English. But he did not pay much heed to my request. The officer\
  \ ordered me to head to customs office. I didn\u2019t expect to find myself in this\
  \ traumatic situation. What I was anticipating to be an exciting trip a while ago\
  \ was slowly turning out to be a forgetful journey.  I perched on a dilapidated\
  \ chair and braced myself to be grilled by these wise men (pun intended). Much to\
  \ my delight, the custom official knew English. He empathized on my ordeal and asked\
  \ the officer for my release. Finally, the immigration official smiled at me and\
  \ affixed entry stamp on my passport \u2013 whispering in my ear (perhaps the only\
  \ English dialect he knew) \u2013 WELCOME TO SAUDI ARABIA. \n\nAliyah wanted to\
  \ scream at the top of her lungs when she saw a sight of me but we were aware when\
  \ in Saudi, do as the Saudi diktat says. So, I silently followed her to the car,\
  \ met her family and started my Arabic expedition. \n\nYou will definitely fall\
  \ in love with Riyadh if you are a nature admirer. Widespread boulevard with tall\
  \ palm trees in the middle of the highway, Sunlight shimmering on the far-sight\
  \ deserts producing a mirage effect and a motorcade of GMC, HUMMER, BUGATTI, LAND\
  \ ROVER, BENTLEY alongside us gave a pleasant welcome.  \n\nWell if you thought\
  \ that my tryst with the phrase \u201CI didn\u2019t expect to find\u201D ended with\
  \ hard-fought battle at the airport, then you are sadly mistaken. But before I kill\
  \ the element of surprise, it is obligatory on my part to cheer about the hospitality\
  \ being shown by Aliyah.  Both of us explored the historical heritage of Riyadh.\
  \ We were in awe of majestic red sand dunes, glorious acacia valley, splendid king\u2019\
  s forest, magnificent thumamah park, calm lake kharrarah, and luxurious camel rides.\
  \ However, our visit to the magnanimous Kingdom Tower stole the show. It is an architectural\
  \ marvel. The front elevation of this marvelous building stands a class apart. Aliyah\
  \ was bragging about how she convinced me to visit Saudi Arabia. I would not shy\
  \ away from her statement, but that it was only her selling skills that acted as\
  \ a catalyst may prove to be an exaggerated claim. A huge factor that had strengthened\
  \ my resolve was the chance to savor authentic Arabic food. Special mention must\
  \ be made for Laham Mandi (mutton with rice), Faham Mandi (grilled chicken with\
  \ rice), and Knafeh dessert. For heaven\u2019s sake, please do not miss out eating\
  \ all of them whenever you visit Riyadh. \n\nNow that I have given you enough reasons\
  \ to plan your next holiday to Riyadh, let me tell you a brief story about how I\
  \ never went back from the kingdom. \n\nIt was meant to be the last leg of the trip.\
  \ I hosted Aliyah and her family for a dinner at Four Seasons in Kingdom Tower.\
  \ A prolific gentleman who was sitting on a couch about ten foot steps away from\
  \ us started making his way towards our table. He was an old friend of Aliyah's\
  \ father. He introduced himself to me as an executive at a telecom company. It makes\
  \ sense for you to know that I am a telecom engineer as my  \u201CI didn\u2019t\
  \ expect to find\u201D moment correlates to my academic background. An ordinary\
  \ discussion with the gentleman transformed into an employment letter for me. I\
  \ held my breath for a moment and inadvertently talked to myself \u2013 I didn\u2019\
  t expect to find a job on this tour?"
