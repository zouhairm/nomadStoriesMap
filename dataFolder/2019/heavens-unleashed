  \ Melville\n\nPakistan has been named the best travel destination of 2018 by the\
  \ British Backpacker Society. \u2018One of the friendliest countries on earth, with\
  \ mountain scenery that is beyond anyone\u2019s wildest imagination,\u2019 they\
  \ complemented.\n\nToday I want to share with you my travel to Neelam Valley, this\
  \ is one of most beautiful places of Azad Kashmir situated in Pakistan. Off the\
  \ beaten path, Neelum Valley offers you a chance to get away from the trials and\
  \ tribulations of city life and explore one of the most beautiful places on the\
  \ planet.\n\nA land of blue waters, panoramic valleys and breathtaking greenery,\
  \ home to God\u2019s manifestations of beauty in nature is the Neelum Valley, one\
  \ of Pakistan\u2019s most enchanting tourist destinations. Those who have set foot\
  \ on this land call it heaven on earth.\n\nThe valley features a number of small\
  \ village settlements, trekking trails, mountain passes and other unique scenic\
  \ features which are spread all over the valley. Halfway along your journey on the\
  \ first day, you will land at Keran. Exploring this beautiful village on the banks\
  \ of the River Neelum is the closest you may get to Indian Kashmir, which lies just\
  \ across the river. The riverbed here is narrow, and you can see past the gushing\
  \ waves of the river to a very similar life on the other side: women sowing seeds\
  \ in the fields, children playing along the banks and astonishingly similar wooden\
  \ houses in the middle of grassy fields.\n\nThe two main destination points are\
  \ Sharda, a quiet village one kilometre off the main road and connected via a hanging\
  \ bridge, and Kel, the largest settlement in the entire region. From Sharda, the\
  \ mystical Noorinar top can be sighted touching the sky. \n\nOn a day\u2019s trek\
  \ from the beautiful village of Dwarian is the Ratti Gali Lake, undoubtedly a tourist\u2019\
  s favourite retreat. The lake, situated at the border between Neelum Valley and\
  \ Kaghan Valley, at an elevation of 14,000 ft, features grassy meadows that beg\
  \ you to tread upon them barefoot.\n\nNight travel is highly recommended as the\
  \ idea is to savour every moment of your adventure. If your vehicle has a sunroof,\
  \ stick out your head and feel the swift air blow across your face as your jeep\
  \ lights navigate through the darkness.\n\nEvery nature exploration trip has its\
  \ climax and Neelum Valley offers its own at Taobat. The village is a few kilometres\
  \ short of the Line of Control, at the point where Neelum River enters Azad Kashmir.\
  \ At the heart of this small village, surrounded by green meadows, flows the Taobat\
  \ Nala or Taobat stream, with its blue waters reflecting the colours of the sky.\
  \ Crossing to the other side of the stream, you will find yourself at the banks\
  \ of the Neelum River emerging from a narrow gorge at the far end of the valley.\
  \ Vast grassy fields at the base of surrounding mountains, alongside the Neelum\
  \ River, are of a unique kind you will rarely find elsewhere.\n\nSince nights and\
  \ early mornings are a special time at Taobat, I spent some time one night beside\
  \ the Taobat nala admiring the overwhelming aura of the moonlit valley. As the late\
  \ hours of the night approached, the moon slowly peeked in from behind the gigantic\
  \ silhouettes of the surrounding mountains, its silver blaze increasingly reflecting\
  \ onto the gleaming Taobat Nala, as the voice of the stream echoed through the deafening\
  \ silence.\n\nThe rare specialty of the Neelum Valley lies in the variety of experiences\
  \ that it has to offer.  From dusty rocky roads to beautiful winding treks, from\
  \ heavenly green pastures to crystal clear waterfalls, and from excellent camping\
  \ grounds to well-maintained hotel accommodations, Neelum Valley is a complete tourist\
  \ package for all those who appreciate nature at its best.\n\nYou may be a parent\
  \ looking for a long due family vacation with your grown up kids, or a group of\
  \ young people in search for an adrenaline rush, or honeymooners looking for a memorable\
  \ night-out under the moon, or a solo traveler in search of his/her soul in the\
  \ purity of nature, Neelum Valley has all that you need."
