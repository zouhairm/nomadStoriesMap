Text: "Austraila. How do I even begin to describe my experience. What I thought would\
  \ be one of the greatest experience of my life, and up being something completely\
  \ different.  \nGreat, yes. Easy? No.\n\nI arrived the first week in November, I\
  \ came because being native to canada and still not understand how to survive the\
  \ cold, seemed like the best decision. Melbourne being my first stop, much colder\
  \ than I excepted, felt more like London that the stereotypically Austraila. \n\n\
  After looking through jobs sites such as backpacker online or gumtree. All I could\
  \ find was sales jobs, so if you are looking for job security, probably not the\
  \ place for you. \n\nHowever, the Victoria market is my second favorite place I've\
  \ been too. Handmade clothes, local food and delicious samples. If you come to Austraila\
  \ avoid popular food chains! You will wish you didn't just spend 14 dollars on a\
  \ Big mac. \n\nUnfornately, I had to leave Melbourne. When on backpacker job board\
  \ I noticed alot of posts for Bundaberg. So there I went, crossing 3 states on 2\
  \ buses and train. \n\nArriving in Bundaberg I didn't have much expectation....\
  \ My destination was a working hostel. The hostel had pool, a bar and more. I got\
  \ work right away, but if you don't know anything about Bundaberg it's all farm\
  \ work.... And Rum. \nMy first job wasn't so bad, it was sorting tomatoes. Little\
  \ did I know it was the end of the busy season, so my job was limited. For about\
  \ a month after work finished it. It was difficult to get more than 16 hours a week,\
  \ and that barely paid my rent.\n\n Only thing that made it worth while was all\
  \ the scandalous adventurous I got my self into. From Christmas on the beach drinking,\
  \ to punching a handsy guy in the face and to jumping into the hostel pool at mid-night\
  \ on new years. \n\nIn the end, friendship doesn't paid the bills. I changed to\
  \ another working hostel from a few friends I met at the hostel. \nAgain, got work\
  \ right away. \nMy job was to pick sweet potatoes (glamorous I know). From weed\
  \ pulling to picking up the potatoes, it was a relatively easy job. Only unsettling\
  \ thing was the farm owner, well he had a swastika on his hand. \nAfter my first\
  \ day, I was struck by bad news. My childhood friend died, he was a recovering addict.\
  \ I had asked for a personal day, as I think anyone would. After that, I got no\
  \ work.  I still believe it's because I asked for a personal day, but I could prove\
  \ it. \n\nMy final destination is tennant creek, but what's the destination without\
  \ the journey. My journey starts with a greyhound to Townsville, relatively normal.\
  \ Once I got to Townsville however it was raining, I didn't think much. Turns out,\
  \ it was a monsoon. Now i know what you are thinking, why didn't you look up the\
  \ weather? I'm pretty sure they get the weather readings from a fortune cookie,\
  \ don't rely on any weather reading in Austraila. With the Monsoon, ended up leaving\
  \ right before the evacuations.  The city ended flooding and had what I can only\
  \ describe as the most Austrailian thing I've ever heard. The floods cause crocodiles\
  \ to come into the town, which causes a major problem from the locals as you can\
  \ imagine.\n\nTennant Creek.... \nMy last stop of Australia. \nTennant Creek, is\
  \ mostly aboriginals. The northern territories government has some of the most strict\
  \ laws for alcohol I've ever seen. The liquor stores are open 3 hours a day. When\
  \ they open,  the lines are out the door and they scan your passport. You see a\
  \ place plagued my alcoholism and child rape and murder.  It's very different from\
  \ any prospective of Austraila I could think of. \n\nSo why am I here still? \n\
  Because even in struggle, there is beauty. Austraila is full of it. \n\nThank you."
