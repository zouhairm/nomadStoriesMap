Text: "Following the rental car pick up at the Lanzarote Airport, we set of to the\
  \ journey across the island towards our beach house. The one hour ride showed us\
  \ what we would later deem as Lanzarote's blessing. But at the time we saw only\
  \ dimmed horrors. The emptiness which surrounded us seemed monstrously hostile.\
  \ I couldn't spot the line between land and ocean since everything looked merely\
  \ like a dark void, absorbing light from my vision. The blackness of this forsaken\
  \ desert gave me the impression that we were literally in the middle of nowhere.\
  \ The stars, per contra, shined stupendously bright and cheerful. Hence I decided\
  \ to look up, instead of around.\n\nArriving at our destination, we found a ghost\
  \ village instead of the fishermen's one. The houses in Caleta de Famara were closed,\
  \ the gas station was closed, the store was closed. Empty streets were nameless,\
  \ quiet houses were numberless. Everything was just so eeringly silent, even the\
  \ waves muffled disastrously.\n\nAfter some time of cruising up and down the creepy\
  \ lanes, we spotted a guy. This Spanish guy with long dark hair, thin in his bleached\
  \ jeans and a bit muddy tee, was idly smoking by the car. He didn't speak much of\
  \ English. But after he smiled at us asking something which we understood was a\
  \ question about whether we surf, we recognised our fellow surfer there. Then we\
  \ showed him the map explaining what we were looking for. However, the address didn't\
  \ ring any bells to him.\n\nWe couldn't clarify the situation to our host since\
  \ our argument of \u201Estanding in front of the white house with big windows\u201C\
  \ covered pretty much any neighbourhood around. \u201EHand me your phone,\u201C\
  \ our Spanish friend said. I was really suspicious and nervous about giving our\
  \ stuff voluntarily to a shady streetboy stranger. I am ashamed of my prejudice,\
  \ especially since I come from a coastal town where things hang loose by their definition\
  \ and surfing is modus vivendi I aim to. The interpersonal suspicion I've developed\
  \ during my law studies in the Croatian Capital is one of the most dangerous things\
  \ I cure traveling. Anyway, the guy called our host saying \u201Esome chicos inglese\u201C\
  \ are waiting for her. She was there in a minute, jumping out of the house next\
  \ door. We thanked the Spanish guy and entered our house unaware that we are not\
  \ calling it a night yet.\n\nOur accommodation had big glass doors and windows.\
  \ I wasn't really comfortable with the fact that only a light lock separated us\
  \ from the outer world. Suddenly, a sound was coming from behind the backdoor. Someone\
  \ was growling and trying to get inside. Curiosity killed the cat, I thought. But\
  \ curiosity also kills ignorance, so I tiptoed to the door, took a deep breath,\
  \ grabbed the doorknob and opened it agressively. I was counting on my decisiveness\
  \ to shock the opponent. Two sparkling eyes with bared jaws were staring at me.\
  \ It was a Yorkshire Terrier, whom we shared our backyard with, smiling at me! Nevertheless,\
  \ as the scary starry night drained me, I told Mr. Yorki we'll see eachother tomorrow.\
  \ Admittedly, I double checked all the doors and windows before going to bed.\n\n\
  As the morning came, the village seemed much friendlier. Its black sandy streets\
  \ were framed with cacti, fishing nets and surfing kit. Opposed to the white houses\
  \ of Caleta, there was the wild Famara Beach beneath the majestic Risco Cliff. The\
  \ spectacular scenery was soothing my nature loving soul. After long surfs and longer\
  \ chills in the following days, our neighbourhood was getting cozier and cozier.\n\
  \nEventually, our porch became a living room for the Spanish guy, his crew and Mr.\
  \ Yorki. We were eating fresh seafood, drinking beer, making smoothies, getting\
  \ tanned, and listening to the Atlantic whispers. We didn't speak each other's language,\
  \ but we shared a common mother tongue \u2013 Taking It Easy. Thus we enjoyed siestas\
  \ in a place so innocent and magical a night visitor would easily be tricked into\
  \ finding it to be a forsaken desert in the middle of nowhere. It is remarkable\
  \ how life gets much nicer when you're jumping onto the waves rather than to conclusions."
