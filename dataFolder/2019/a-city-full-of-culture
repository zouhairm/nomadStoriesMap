Text: "Morning started with the sound of bells, I was wondering, who's ranging the\
  \ bell here! I rushed to the balcony, there was a vehicle called \"Tanga\" was standing\
  \ there. Yes, I'm talking about them city full of culture, the second city of British\
  \ Empire, kolkata! \nI barely knew about the city from books, so just started the\
  \ day with a high hope. Got on a Tanga and told the puller to bring me to a good\
  \ place for breakfast. He (the puller) was very friendly, he started talking to\
  \ me about the old kolkata and the places I must have to visit. We reached in the\
  \ new market place, there were small tea stalls around. I started walking. Decided\
  \ to start my day with a cup of tea. The interesting part about their tea was, they\
  \ serve it in a small clay cup. The aroma of clay takes the taste of hot tea into\
  \ another level. Finishing my tea, I proceeded into a stall, where they were making\
  \ chicken egg roll. I ordered one. They made it in front of me immediately, after\
  \ having the bite, it felt like I'm having a party inside my mouth! Full of spices,\
  \ lil tangy! It was so good. After satisfying my tummy, decided to go to the railway\
  \ station on Haorah, that was known as one of the oldest railway stations in Indian\
  \ subcontinent. After getting into the taxi toward haorah, I realized, I have never\
  \ seen a taxi like this. The ambience was completely different. It had some religious\
  \ gods images inside it with a different aroma. The driver dropped me in front of\
  \ the station. The station was fully crowded, and the bridge looks majestic from\
  \ the railway station. I looked down to the bridge, I sad there is a flower market,\
  \ so decided to go there. The local people bring fresh flowers there in the morning\
  \ and later it's been distributed to the whole city. I sas some people making fresh\
  \ dumplings near the market, even though I was quite full, the smell of fresh dumplings\
  \ just dragged me. After having some of those, decided to go to the college street.\
  \ This is the place where most of the prominent colleges and universities are, and\
  \ I was actually looking for the bookshops. Those bookshops were around 150 years\
  \ old. I was surprised seeing their collection of books, found some really classic\
  \ books. Later I went to the potters area where they work on the goddesses for puja.\
  \ I was simply started seeing the practice of pottery, the techniques were too delicate\
  \ but the professional potters managed the soft clay confidently. I tried to make\
  \ a lion by the help of potters, naturally didn't came out even near to perfect,\
  \ but I was happy! At least I tried. After my pottery session, I thought of going\
  \ to a local cafe, so I went to \"coffee house\" which was 1876. I never saw a coffee\
  \ house this big with the population of diverse age groups. I could relate every\
  \ lyrics of a famous song of coffee house and it was giving me goosebumps! I took\
  \ a cup of coffee with a chicken cutlets and finished it quickly. After finishing\
  \ my coffee, I went to the palace of Rabindranath Tagor, who was known as one of\
  \ the pioneers of bengali literature. After visiting the palace, I was really tired.\
  \ I wanted some rest with some real foods. So after asking some suggestions for\
  \ foods, decided to go to taste their hakka cuisine. Went to marquis street and\
  \ orderd some hakka noodles with chicken lollipops. I taste awesome and I never\
  \ had such flavorful food in my life. Later, I thought of watching a movie, so went\
  \ to a movie theater near new market. What a big movie theater! Took some popcorn\
  \ as my companion, went into the movie. This was a beautiful day with lots of activities\
  \ but the fun part was its food. If anyone can ever gets of an opportunity, you\
  \ must visit kolkata one."
