Text: "We went on a road trip that was an incredible feat\nAnd I was the navigator\
  \ in the passenger seat\nBecause here in Arizona there are many sights that cannot\
  \ be beat\nTake an adventure and you\u2019re in for a treat\nBut the question is,\
  \ can you take the heat?\n\nDriving on the highway where the earth turns red\nOn\
  \ 89A is the town of Sedona straight ahead\nBuilt in the rocks, the Chapel of the\
  \ Holy Cross stands majestic and true\nClimb up Cathedral Rock to an unbeatable\
  \ view\nSit on the rocks which are a deep copper hue\nOr go to the top and yell\
  \ Wahoo!\n\nAntelope Canyon was the next stop on our map\nAnd let it be on yours,\
  \ as many pictures you will snap\nEntering the tall sandstone walls, you walk through\
  \ the gap\nIf ripples were turned to stone is my description, my recap\nAnd believe\
  \ me at the end of the tour you will want to give quite the clap\n\nIf you want\
  \ a photograph like no other, my advice I will lend\nDriving in Page you will come\
  \ to a dirt lot, turn here I recommend\nGrab your mother, brother, sister, or friend\n\
  And walk the trail until you\u2019ve come to a dead end\nBecause here you\u2019\
  ve arrived at Horseshoe Bend\n\nLooking at the canyon and the river below, a wonderful\
  \ time you will spend\nA canyon this incredible and vast is hard to comprehend\n\
  As the scenery looks like a green screen and a little pretend\nBut to see something\
  \ so picturesque was my inspiration for the poem I just penned  \nAnd I can\u2019\
  t wait to continue this exciting weekend \n\nOne bright and early morning we went\
  \ to a place far and remote\nTo go somewhere which is only accessible by boat\n\
  The brilliant blue water surrounds the canyon like a moat\nA mile on the trailhead\
  \ is what you must devote\nTo reach the next destination of which here I wrote\n\
  \nOne of the largest natural bridges known to mankind\nRainbow Bridge on Lake Powell\
  \ is a true treasure find\nBy water, rock, and wind it was incredibly designed\n\
  The canyon walls surround you in front, on the side, and behind\nStanding 290 feet\
  \ into the sky, looking in awe brings a peaceful state of mind\n\t\nMonument Valley\
  \ of the American Southwest \nIs where Forrest Gump stopped running and finished\
  \ his quest\nThe sandstone buttes that stand tall and look like a hand\nAre called\
  \ the three mittens that I understand  \nAnd the view at sunrise or sunset was one\
  \ of the best\n\nA natural wonder that is utterly cool\nThe only place in America\
  \ where post is \u201CMailed by Mule\u201D\nComing here will make you feel as tiny\
  \ as a molecule\nHere I welcome you to the Grand Canyon- Arizona\u2019s crown jewel\
  \ \n\nStep up to the rim and you\u2019ll go wide-eyed\nSit on the rocks at Hopi\
  \ Point and great pictures it will provide\nI guarantee you won\u2019t find another\
  \ place worldwide\nYou will stand there in awe and put your worries aside\nThat\
  \ give you this feeling like no other, 100% bona fide\n\nNow Meteor Crater is a\
  \ visit we did owe \nWhere a long time ago on the Colorado Plateau\nA giant meteorite\
  \ hit about 50,000 years ago\nStand on the rim and look down below\nThere\u2019\
  s a giant hole in the ground that\u2019ll make you say whoa!\n\nOur trip is not\
  \ yet finished and would not be complete \nWithout a visit to America\u2019s most\
  \ famous street\nRoute 66 is a step back in time where nostalgia is sweet \nWhere\
  \ the oldies music makes your heart skip a beat\nThe bright neon lights are the\
  \ first thing you greet \nAnd to take a stroll in the evening the mood is pleasant\
  \ and upbeat \n\nSo that was the road trip of Katie and Kate\nA total of 1,000 miles\
  \ on highways, back roads, and the interstate\nBecause to be a tourist in your own\
  \ state\nOur history and land I did appreciate \nSo, take my advice a visit to Arizona\
  \ is terrific and great \nBut please remember to wear sunscreen and hydrate!"
