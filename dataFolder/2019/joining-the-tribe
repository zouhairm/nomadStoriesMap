Text: "Outside the town we crossed suburbs with small houses and took a straight road\
  \ that seemed to lead to the end of the world. After a while we diverted by lonely\
  \ unpaved roads. Extensive birch forests stretched in endless plains on both sides\
  \ of the way. It was difficult to cross with a passer-by, and the vehicles looked\
  \ abandoned. The barking of some dog was the only sign of life in the villages around.\n\
  \nWe left behind the city of Bayandai and took a secondary road that led to the\
  \ western shore of Lake Baikal. It was impressive to see that huge frozen surface.\
  \ The ice layer had to be very thick, since the vehicles circulated across it easily.\
  \ The icy wind hurt my face, but all that beauty was worthy.\"It's the most beautiful\
  \ lake in the world,\" said the guide.\" In summer it changes color all the time\"\
  .\n\nWe continued ascending. After Elantsy, the road alternated stretches of gravel\
  \ and asphalt, but the last stretch was very different. In summer, it was a small\
  \ strip of water that separated the island from the mainland and people crossed\
  \ it by ferry. Now the strait was completely frozen and allowed to reach Olkhon\
  \ Island by car. Our destination was a northwest town called Uzuri. There we would\
  \ stay with a native family.\n\nSome native people came to meet us in the vicinity\
  \ of the village. They wore very colorful clothes, and smiled all the time. Then\
  \ they took us to tents covered with a waterproof canvas mixed with wool. It could\
  \ have been the scenary from a movie about Genghis Khan. The guide explained that\
  \ we were in an \"ulus\" or family commune and the tents were yurtas of nomads,\
  \ the traditional Buryats home.\n\nThe yurt was divided into two parts: the western\
  \ side, with farm implements stored belonged to the men and the eastern side, that\
  \ was intended for women. There was a kitchen there. We were assigned the north-facing\
  \ side, which was reserved for the guests. Even without great amenities, the store\
  \ was very cozy. There was a powerful cast iron stove in the center, and the floor\
  \ was covered with brightly colored carpets. Feather pillows and fur blankets were\
  \ around. I was tired and sleepy, but I needed a bath.\n\nThe banya was very close.\
  \ It was a cabin with a fireplace, through which a warm steam emanated. Something\
  \ to thank, because we were at 25 negative degrees. A native woman invited me to\
  \ come in kindly, handing me some oak and soap tree branches. With gestures she\
  \ told me they were to rub the body. She also gave me a towel, a head cap, and a\
  \ bowl of tea. \u2014Sapsovo\u2014I said. The woman laughed. Then she closed the\
  \ door hermetically, so that the heat did not escape.\n\nThe parilka was a cabin\
  \ with a wooden bench and a stone stove with some red-hot stones on it. By pouring\
  \ water on them, those clouds of steam rose. Once inside, I took off my clothes\
  \ and tried to relax. It smelled like mint and grandma's soap. Then the steam became\
  \ a little suffocating, but I had a bucket full of snow and ice on hand to cool\
  \ me down. Snow and ice!\n\nThe last step consisted of a massage with the oak branches,\
  \ softened by the water. I decided to skip it and grabbed the bucket of boiling\
  \ water. Phew! It was burning. Impossible to use it without mixing with cold water.\
  \ Burning or freezing were the options, I thought, trying to mix the boiling water\
  \ with the small blocks of ice. At first, I wasted a lot of water, but soon I took\
  \ practice, and I dared to lather. It was not so bad after all. That system was\
  \ similar to the one used in modern spas. Rather more rustic, but with similar effects.\
  \ I felt proud and strong after fears vanished like steam. Ready to show everyone\
  \ that I was not a scary Westerner. Feeling a true Siberian."
