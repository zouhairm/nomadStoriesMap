Text: "In the Caribbean we have a saying, \"Caribbean to the world\" which tells of\
  \ our exploits out of our little part of the world into the great unknown. \n\n\
  I've lived all my life in my tiny twin-island country, Trinidad and Tobago, and\
  \ felt the strong desire to explore the vastness out there, to live in a country\
  \ where it would take more than 4 hours to drive from one end to the next. I decided\
  \ that a 1 week vacation wasn't going to cut it so I packed up my life and moved\
  \ to Sydney, Australia as my first stop.\n\nI remember how far I tried to stretch\
  \ my neck to catch a glimpse of the Sydney Opera House as I rode over the Harbour\
  \ Bridge for the very first time. I had seen these landmarks on television for as\
  \ long as I could remember and here I was actually seeing them with my own eyes.\
  \ Sydney is a city that impressed me from my very first day there. It has a little\
  \ something for everyone - there is the city feeling with tall buildings and bustling\
  \ streets, there are scenic beaches with sparkling blue water, and there are cosy\
  \ cafes lining the streets and tempting my taste buds at every turn.\n\nI sometimes\
  \ feel like patting myself on the back for choosing Sydney as the first place to\
  \ spend some extended time. I am definitely going to continue my travels and see\
  \ where life takes me next. I am on my way to living the dream of Caribbean to the\
  \ world, one country at a time."
