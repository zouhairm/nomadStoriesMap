Text: "In Bali, they call the sun god Dewa Surya. And all today, his golden chariot\
  \ has suffocated the blue of the sky, burning into every tree on the island, heating\
  \ the green fruit of the jungle, fermenting the small globes into a sour mush that\
  \ the monkeys pop into their smacking mouths, like Jello shots.\n\nIt\u2019s not\
  \ easy to walk quickly in an ankle-length sarong, and I nearly step on a drunk monkey.\
  \ He's all gray fur, long tail, and pink belly exposed, stretched out on the stone\
  \ path to the Shiva temple.\n\nNext to me, Bella sighs: \u201CNooooooo.\u201D And\
  \ her tiny hand goes into mine. \n\nFor a 3-year-old, she has a hell of a grip.\n\
  \nI\u2019ve never walked into The Monkey Forest this way. The long chains that usually\
  \ partition the South of the forest are gone, and that quiet space is now teeming\
  \ with women wearing shimmering sarongs and kebaya tops, their shoulders and backs\
  \ supple and straight, tall baskets of food and flowers balanced on their heads.\
  \ \n\nTilem. The monthly ceremony for the Dark Moon is tonight. \n\n\u201COh my\
  \ god, they look so cool!\u201D\n\n\u201CI gotta take a photo!\u201D\n\nA crowd\
  \ of tourists gather around us, the flash on their DSLR and iPhones click-click-clicking.\
  \ Once in a while, they stop when a young monkey climbs onto their shoulder. \n\n\
  One tourist yelps when one reaches into her pocket and steals a tin of mints.\n\n\
  None of the monkeys dare to jump on the Balinese woman.  \n\n\u201CCan I take a\
  \ picture of you?\u201D a young woman bends down to Bella.   \n\nBella looks up\
  \ at this Lululemon blonde. \n\nBella\u2019s eyes turn small, her mouth pinching\
  \ in, like an itsy rosebud. \n\nWithout a word, Bella keeps marching on, dragging\
  \ me with her. \n\nThe local women laugh as the tourist skulks away. Two women say\
  \ something to Ibu, Bella\u2019s mother, and all three laugh again. Their silvery\
  \ voices waft up to Dewa Surya, who is still perched on the horizon, his golden\
  \ crown almost quivering in anticipation of tilem.\n\nBella points at another inebriated\
  \ monkey. \n\n\u201COk, terimah kasih.\" I say \"thank you,\" one of the few words\
  \ I know in Indonesian.\n\nI want to let go of Bella, and wipe my sweaty eyebrows,\
  \ but she makes us take a sharp right turn. \n\nAnd now we are walking straight\
  \ into the gates of Pura Tirta Suamaia, the Shiva temple.\n\nJust a hop over the\
  \ overflow of a small creek nearby, and we\u2019re no longer in the manicured, open\
  \ jungle grounds. Here, the trees are closer together, tangled with vines, gekkos\
  \ clicking their tongues as they climb up and down the sticky, oozing barks, dragonflies\
  \ zooming in and out of the crevices, their wings the color of soap bubbles. \n\n\
  A dead firefly is stuck on a vine, swarmed with auburn ants. \n\nThere are two young\
  \ men at the gate, dressed in white sarong, white batik, white udeng covering their\
  \ dark hair. They are the priests-in-training.   \n\nThey nod when the local women\
  \ come in, when I come in with Bella. \n\nA group of tourists take a few hesitant\
  \ steps forward, the zoom lenses on their cameras raised into the temple courtyard.\
  \ \u201CSorry,\u201D the men in white tell the tourists, in heavily-accented English.\
  \ \u201CCeremony tonight.\u201D \n\nTilem. Tonight, for the dark moon, we ask Dewa\
  \ Surya to illuminate our darkest thoughts.\n \nAll around me are statues of Shiva.\
  \ Eyes bulging, his tongue unfurled from his mouth like a predator who wants to\
  \ taste your sweat before ripping into your spine. Death god. Destroyer god.\n\n\
  \u201CFollow what me and Bella do,\u201D Ibu tells me as we walk into the inner\
  \ sanctum. The sound of the priest\u2019s bells get louder and louder. \u201CWhat\
  \ you wish Shiva take from you?\u201D\n\nThe air now smells like burning honey.\
  \ \n\nIn front of me, I see rows of women and a few men, on their knees with palms\
  \ upraised, clumps of uncooked rice pasted on the middle of their foreheads, pasted\
  \ on the pulse point of their clavicles, eyelids fluttering shut as they pray to\
  \ the gods, as blessed water is sprinkled over their heads. \n\nSoon, it will be\
  \ my turn."
