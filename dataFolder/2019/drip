Text: "Drip. Drip. Drip. \nI\u2019m woken by the steady sound of water hitting the\
  \ vinyl tablecloth of the vintage RV I\u2019m staying in. It certainly wasn\u2019\
  t the wake-up call I was expecting, although I\u2019m sure no one expects to get\
  \ caught in the rain in the middle of the Mojave Desert. \nDrip. \nStill groggy,\
  \ I take a look around for anything I can find: pots, bowls, a weird decorative\
  \ vase. They\u2019re placed strategically around the table and along the floor,\
  \ giving the illusion of a yard sale I frankly wouldn\u2019t want to visit. As a\
  \ result, I\u2019m virtually eating breakfast out of my hands while carefully avoiding\
  \ the splash of the rainwater that is now being collected. \nDrip. \nI can\u2019\
  t help but laugh to myself. I should\u2019ve predicted that my visit would align\
  \ perfectly with the storm of the season. It\u2019s as if Nature herself could sense\
  \ my emotional state and felt the need to announce it to the whole valley.  She\
  \ painted the sky with a haziness that could have been plucked directly from my\
  \ mind and blended my swirling thoughts about the uncertainty of my future with\
  \ the swirling wind and rain beautifully.\nDrip. \nI brave the weather enough to\
  \ run to the car. I wasn\u2019t about to let Her ruin my meticulously planned vacation.\
  \ With the wipers wiping back and forth at full speed, you can barely see the extraterrestrial\
  \ terrain just beyond the window. \nThat\u2019s when I see it. The Joshua Tree.\
  \ Its twisted arms and spiky leaves demand attention against the rocky terrain.\
  \ \nYou can almost hear Her whisper \u201CTake this in.\u201D As the skies lift,\
  \ you can begin to appreciate its glory. Standing before me is a tree; a tree that\
  \ took generations of overcoming harsh conditions to simply exist, its bends and\
  \ curves revealing its resilience. Its stories can be traced across its bark. It\
  \ becomes strikingly obvious to me that there\u2019s beauty in patience and persistence.\
  \ Growth takes time. \nDrip. \nThe skies open up again with a downpour unlike before.\
  \ I race to my car and continue my journey around the park. The trip back to the\
  \ RV is slow thanks to the flash floods She throws my way. Despite all this, I feel\
  \ better somehow. Don\u2019t get me wrong, I\u2019m still an emotional wreck. My\
  \ mind is still overcrowded with worries, and my emotions are still unsettled. But\
  \ something about Joshua Tree provided me with a moment of clarity. I might not\
  \ have it all figured out. I might have obstacles and hardships standing in my way.\
  \ The road to my future might not be forged or even obvious yet.  Growth takes time.\
  \ As much as I\u2019d like to have an answer here and now, I know if I\u2019m patient\
  \ and persistent I\u2019ll get there someday. The journey might be riddled with\
  \ twists and turns, but that\u2019s just part of life\u2019s beauty. \nDrip. Drip.\
  \ Drip.\nThe pots and bowls and decorative vases are overflowing and water is dripping\
  \ on the vinyl tablecloth. \n\u201CI\u2019m sorry we had such bad luck with the\
  \ weather today\u201D, my friend\u2019s apology snaps me back to reality.\n\u201C\
  It's not what I expected but I couldn\u2019t have asked for anything better.\u201D"
