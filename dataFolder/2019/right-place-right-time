Text: "When I went to the Gold Coast in March 2018 being an adrenaline junkie I wanted\
  \ to experience the theme parks. I was travelling alone and had tried to map out\
  \ where to go and when before I arrived. On the first day it was easy to find my\
  \ way around town as I was using a mapping application. I went to Ripleys believe\
  \ it or not museum and Dracula\u2019s because I love wierd, wacky and scary things.\
  \ On the second day I took a train to somewhere because I had to catch a connecting\
  \ bus to go to SeaWorld because I wanted to go there on that day. After getting\
  \ off the train I tried to use my maps application to find the bus stop to catch\
  \ the bus to go to SeaWorld but it kept giving me wrong directions so I got lost.\
  \ Not having any mobile data I kept walking around streets trying to find someone\
  \ to help me. I eventually found a hotel and asked the receptionist where to catch\
  \ a bus. Evidently I caught the wrong bus and ended up somewhere else. I got off\
  \ at Helensvale bus station and asked someone else how to get to SeaWorld but I\
  \ caught the wrong bus again and went to Movie world instead. I went on some of\
  \ the rides, played some games at the arcade and bought a few souvenirs. At the\
  \ end of the day when I got back to my hotel I scrolled through Facebook and discovered\
  \ that my cousin and her son were at Movie world on the same day. I messaged her\
  \ and we decided we were going to meet up at SeaWorld the next day. On day three\
  \ I managed to catch the right train and bus to SeaWorld but when I arrived I received\
  \ a message from my cousin that she wasn\u2019t able to come because her son had\
  \ hidden her keys. I still went to SeaWorld, took lots of photos and bought a few\
  \ momentos then went back to the hotel. Back at the hotel I messaged my cousin that\
  \ maybe we could meet up and go shopping together. On day four I checked out of\
  \ my hotel, put my luggage in storage and went shopping at Australia Fair with my\
  \ cousin and her son. I bought some clothes and a few other things then said goodbye\
  \ and went our separate ways. I went back to the hotel to pick up my luggage and\
  \ put my shopping away then caught a couple of buses to the airport. I had lots\
  \ of fun exploring the Gold Coast but I was glad to be going home. I ate lunch at\
  \ the airport, caught the plane and flew to home sweet home."
