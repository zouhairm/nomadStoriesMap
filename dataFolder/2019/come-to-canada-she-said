Text: "One could class me as a man of comfort. I generally tend to favour consistency,\
  \ predictability and just a general awareness of the what\u2019s, where\u2019s and\
  \ when\u2019s of any given situation. One could consequently go on to class me as\
  \ viewing change as the enemy \u2013 a cause of friction and apprehension. \n\n\
  Growing up, the concept of change was non-existent. I lived in same town, under\
  \ the same roof, in the same school and all within the same network of familiar\
  \ people. This trend naturally expanded into my adolescence, impacting my work,\
  \ interests and overall way of living. \n\nWhat I now refer to as my \u2018quarter\
  \ life crisis\u2019, I reached a powerful yearning for things to be different. For\
  \ quite some time my mind, body and soul endured a three way duel, which eventuated\
  \ with me re-locating to a tropical island. Now, this was not just radically changing\
  \ my hair style or mixing my mornings up with a new cereal. I ended up moving three\
  \ and a half hours away from the realm of my comforts and taking that first true\
  \ step into the unknown.\n\nThe unknown can be re-phrased as \u2018not knowing\u2019\
  . From as deep as not knowing if you will fit in with new people or adapt to completely\
  \ new surroundings. To as petty as not knowing how to cook anything that is not\
  \ two minute noodles or successfully completing a load of washing. The game plan\
  \ was to commit to a short summer season stay and retreat back to my pre-determined\
  \ path. Over the course of what ended up being a year and half, I had socially,\
  \ mentally, physically and even spiritually grown. With this came a significant\
  \ shift in perceiving change as more of an ally \u2013 to be welcomed and pursued.\
  \ \n\nAt the peak of reaching island fever, my friend Dom pounced on this openness\
  \ to change. \u201CCome to Canada\u201D, she said, in such an insistent and persuasive\
  \ fashion. This was beyond just taking another step; this would be taking more of\
  \ a leap into the unknown.\n\nBy the time my visa was approved, Dom was already\
  \ in Canada. Naturally, I could not help but text-harass her with those probing\
  \ \u2018W\u2019 questions. What are we going to do in Canada? Where in Canada will\
  \ we go? When will I meet you in Canada? This man was so infatuated with having\
  \ a plan, that it was hindering the beauty of the unknown. It wasn\u2019t until\
  \ late one evening, when I was staring at a list of dates and flights, whilst anxiously\
  \ awaiting those \u2018W\u2019 answers. My good friend JB (Jim Beam) and given me\
  \ the nudge of clarity and confidence that I needed and clicked myself a one way\
  \ ticket to Toronto. \n\nFor the first week, I spent so much of my time within the\
  \ constraints of a fancy hotel. My courageous 16,000 kilometer leap from down under\
  \ was indistinguishable. I had traveled so far, yet I was essentially still in my\
  \ bubble. The second week in, I transitioned from the walls of leisure to the bunks\
  \ of budget. It was here where I met Franzie, who was that \u2018pop\u2019 that\
  \ I needed. Her personality was infectious. She was outgoing, impulsive and carefree\
  \ \u2013 traits of which I initially envied, but quickly grew to embrace. Our time\
  \ together was short, but not spared, immersing ourselves into the cultural offerings\
  \ that Toronto insisted we try. Our last night together was spent extending such\
  \ cultural awareness into an extensive range of local beers. The next morning I\
  \ met with Franzie for a farewell breakfast and she asks me \u2018Are you all packed?\u2019\
  \ As it had been my intention to stay in Toronto, I was genuinely puzzled. It turns\
  \ out that during our beer-infused rendezvous, my German comrade had booked me a\
  \ bus ticket and accommodation to join her in Ottawa.\n\nThe mystery of it all was\
  \ terrifying, but the rush of excitement that married with this fear was an undeniable\
  \ thrill. It was that distinct moment, the true essence of travel revealed itself.\
  \ \u2018Come to Ottawa\u2019 she said. Without the slightest bit of hesitation,\
  \ this man didn\u2019t have a plan and went on a 6 hour bus ride into the unknown."
