Text: "When you land in Lisbon, the smell is as\nDistinct as a hot NYC pepperoni pizza-\
  \ it\u2019s not pizza but a burnt orange smell that is a feast for the senses; it\
  \ must be lived. Taking EWR-LIS, TAP flight for the good part of 36 years on a yearly\
  \ basis makes the heart grow fonder... not on this last trip however. I packed up\
  \ shop. I left my job in a tiny wine shop in on Greenwich Ave in the west village\
  \ to come back home for an undefined period of time, 17/17 I like to call it. 17\
  \ years in Europe, 17 years in the USA and now a one way ticket to Portugal, I country\
  \ that has given me such emotional depth,\nBut a country that I also detest with\
  \ a passion. I guess Thomas Bernhard must have felt the same about his native Austria\
  \ - post WWII. A friend once told me \u201CLisbon is the perfect tonic for those\
  \ wallowing in self pity and sadness\u201D; it\u2019s where the land ends and the\
  \ sea begins - said one of those overly intelecutialized writers. But... i forgot\
  \ my two sons in NYC,  Seb and Xander, two names reminiscent of American slang nicknames,\
  \ blame the mum, she\u2019s a wonderful mother by the way...This adventure is to\
  \ begin, yet I am not quite certain how the heart will sustain the \u201C saudade\u201D\
  \ that one carries in the very fabric of his soul."
