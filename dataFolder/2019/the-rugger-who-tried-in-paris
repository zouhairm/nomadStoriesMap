Text: "Like every aspiring rugger,I too fancied and positively worked for the cause-the\
  \ upcoming u18 rugby tournament which were to be held in Paris (then in 2017). \
  \ I flexled every move of mine to woo the authorities.\nAnd boom! My hardwork was\
  \ rewarded and   I got a chance to step in Paris (too- pun intended). \nBringing\
  \ my always foreseen, dreamy and illusional fantasy to life- coming to Paris, the\
  \ most romantic city of all.\nOur first and the only errand was to the mighty French\
  \ Rugby Federation, commonly known as the FFR. It is the governing body for rugby\
  \ unions in France. Also responsible for the French national team and the Ligue\
  \ nationale de rugby that administers the country professional league. The FFR has\
  \ an impressive area spreading over an acre. With three full-sized rugby fields\
  \ and one having an over head over for to practice in the winters.\n\nIt was about\
  \ half past 12, halfway into our visit, being jetlagged from the 9 hour straight\
  \ flight from India. But this seemed to not bother us at all, as the environment\
  \ was an absolute nature friendly and alluring peice of work. The whole area was\
  \ full with greeny, with tall trees covering all the outer parts of every field.\
  \ The had their headquarters too located in there.\n\nAll the professionals  both\
  \ men and women playing for the French national team, resided in the premises itself\
  \ for any all trainings before any international tournament. I was constantly trying\
  \ to evade the thoughts of what it is like back in there where I came from.\nFFR\
  \ offered all the fanciable comforts to all he professionals there. \nMoreover,\
  \ we got to know about the Stade de France - national stadium of France, located\
  \ just north of paris with a gigantic seating capacity of 80,698 which makes it\
  \ the eighth-largest stadium in Europe.\nFurther, to sum up we ended at the  4th\
  \ position amongs the counties gathered there for the tournament. \nBut recalling\
  \ every bit of what happened in Paris around me,I could only think it as a place\
  \ as beautiful as a picture!"
