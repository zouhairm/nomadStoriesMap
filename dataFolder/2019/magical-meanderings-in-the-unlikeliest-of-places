Text: "\"You're moving where?  You cannot move there!  You will die!  The drugs! The\
  \ gangs!  It's all over the news!  A week's vacation in a resort is one thing, but\
  \ moving?  Like, living there?  You're crazy to even think about it!!\" \"Crazy!!\"\
  \n\nThis was the general feedback I received from many family members and co-workers\
  \ when I told them that me and my sweet love were leaving the rat race This was\
  \ in 2010 and there were all kinds of horrible atrocities occurring on a daily basis\
  \ in Mexico and being broadcast by the media who were warning people not to travel\
  \ there.\n\nRather than succumb to fear for the unknown, instead we had an epic\
  \ adventure, saw lots of the beauty of the US on the drive down and landed with\
  \ a sweet condo that would end up being our home for the next five years.  We made\
  \ friends, now, like family, some of our life's fondest memories to date, conceived\
  \ and raised a child there for the first 3 years of his life. 700 words will not\
  \ suffice to what can be elaborated upon in the myriad of stories that could be\
  \ told in regards to traveling to & dwelling in Huatulco.  \n\nWe were very fortunate\
  \ to have landed where we did.  A 2 level, 3 bedroom, 2 bath  air conditioned condo,\
  \ 24 hour on site security and a lovely big well kept pool with a surrounding wall\
  \ - the other side of which we later learned was the local drunk tank/cop shop.\
  \ I was tremendously entertained one late evening as I took a swim on the weekend\
  \ to hear a very slurred and loud rendition of the mariachi song \"M\xE9xico Lindo\
  \ y Querido\" emanating from behind the wall. \n\nLater that week I then watched\
  \ in amazed fascination when a man catapulted himself over the wall only to be pursued\
  \ by two officers whose efforts to catch him indicated that perhaps they were paid\
  \ a bribe to let him get a head start.\nI witnessed bribes come in many forms and\
  \ of varying degrees whilst living in Mexico. This is one aspect of the collective\
  \ consciousness you will encounter in Southern Mexico. No judgements, I observe\
  \ it as a cultural practice in this area of the world. It is what it is and an accepted\
  \ custom,  the dervitative intention behind it being one of survival and doing what\
  \ you know with what you have been taught.  \n\n As any good abiding Canadian would\
  \ do, I offered two 3 Litre Coca Cola bottles to the Telmex technicians I saw working\
  \ on the side of the road. As a result of my kindness the projected six week wait\
  \ for basic internet hook up was null and void after those cold bottles reached\
  \ their hands.  Coca Cola is consumed like water and made with corn syrup so basically\
  \ liquid sugar love. Immensely large trucks delivering it about town from the plant\
  \ in the adjacent neighbourhood ridden with pot holes that Mexicans call \"b\xE2\
  ches\". Giant crater like holes in the road that make for a real tactical approach\
  \ when in your truck and being mindful of the health of your vehicle's suspension.\
  \ A mix of low grade crushed rocks, powder and water mixed by hand is the filler\
  \ used for the massive potholes that appear after the rainy season.\n\nThey need\
  \ repaired roads for their parades. Witnessing and being a part of the \"paradas\"\
  \ that the entire community march in wearing traditional and intricatelly designed\
  \ garments is in unity and expression of their pride and love for their country/customs.\
  \ A humbling experience. When you are the minority amongst a large group of united\
  \ citizens from a different land, you feel humility and gratitude that they invite\
  \ you to celebrate with them as though you belong like familiy. \n\nI have an archive\
  \ of memories to share and I haven't even mentioned the most obvious appeal of the\
  \ bays, beaches, restaurants, community, locals and recreation.\n\nThe celebratory\
  \ nature of the country, its traditions, the people and the magical beauty that\
  \ are the Bahias de Huatulco make it a place that I would return to in a heartbeat.\n\
  \nTake a flight there and see if you agree!"
