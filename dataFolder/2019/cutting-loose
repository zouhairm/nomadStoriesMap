Text: "The music and rhythms moved the young couple through the spectacularly festive\
  \ darkness. Accompanied by rapidly exploding pops of flash photography, they inched\
  \ forward through the crowd. Shell shock, if not an antiquated descriptor, would\
  \ have fitted the expressions on their naive faces. But this was meant to be and\
  \ act of love and not war and part of a time-honored ceremony of traditional marriage\
  \ in their country. The bejeweled and bewildered bride leaned heavily on the esteemed\
  \ maid beside her, and the rest of the party, including a stunned and wide-eyed\
  \ bridegroom, clustered close and proceeded as a single entity to the waiting platform.\
  \ Lights, so glaring that they would have burned the skin had there not been a slight\
  \ chill in the air, bore down on the newly bonded family as one after another well-wishers\
  \ smiled and struck a pose behind them before moving into the lantern lit evening\
  \ beyond to consume a lavish buffet. The amiable guests devoured vindaloos with\
  \ all the seriousness of the fire-eater who stood off to the side and entertained\
  \ the bouncing children. The little ones, spun loose by the general air of excitement,\
  \ roamed clear of their preoccupied parents who remained seated to eat and laugh\
  \ and revel astride the long white picnic tables scattered throughout the night.\n\
  \nIf the bride felt as weary and trapped as she looked, I could most certainly sympathize.\
  \ While she was being bound for life through solemn vow in an arrangement unlikely\
  \ to be of her own choosing, I had been abducted for the duration of her deceptively\
  \ jubilant ceremony by the cousin of one of our hosts. Thoughtful as it was of them\
  \ to drive us through the dark Punjabi night to wedding venue after wedding venue\
  \ to gift us the authentic experience of matrimony Indian-style, they had turned\
  \ away for a moment and thus allowed me to be whisked away by an overly excited\
  \ cousin. This short and bird-like woman had latched onto me with all the enthusiasm\
  \ and gusto of a small child adopting a stray cat and furiously exhibiting it to\
  \ all the other children with nary a thought to its level of comfort nor personal\
  \ boundaries. A full twelve inches below my height,  she had an iron grasp on my\
  \ wrist and no resistance on my part, subtle or otherwise, could wrest her fingers\
  \ apart. \n\nPerhaps if I cooperated, I would eventually be forgotten and could\
  \ disappear stealthily into the crowd and leave my captor behind. I smiled and nodded\
  \ as she led me, our arms aloft, throughout the crowd and color to meet all of her\
  \ living friends and relatives. We did not share a language and she introduced me\
  \ with words I did not understand, but which presumably began with \"Look what I\
  \ found!\" I had not caught her name and I doubt if she had caught mine, but that\
  \ mattered little. I was her prize, a trophy that had been awarded to her unexpectedly\
  \ and she was apparently not one to despise opportunity.\n\nHaving exhausted the\
  \ interest of all in the novelty of her towering quarry, she quickly decided upon\
  \ a new opportunity to attract attention.. She would haul me into the undulating\
  \ swirl of the dance floor and teach me whatever I did not know. She underestimated\
  \ her the task before her. Unable to smoothly transition from disco to Bollywood\
  \ in one cathartic moment, I became the hilarious wealth of entertainment she had\
  \ intended. I was determined nevertheless, and she had, after all, let go of my\
  \ hand. It would have been too rude and too obvious to retreat immediately, so I\
  \ gamely stayed and tried to learn her ways.  Music and incense and fire filled\
  \ the air as we moved among the throng of other dancing women, a flowing rainbow\
  \ of saris and glowing copper skin. Across the grounds, the wedding party had finished\
  \ with their photographs. As the families were beginning to disperse, I saw the\
  \ face of the bride relax.  Apprehension was overtaken by abandon and I forgot to\
  \ flee."
