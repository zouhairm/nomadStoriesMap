Text: "Brazil is a huge country with many things to know. Each region of this enormous\
  \ country brings a chest full of surprises. In 2014 I made a trip that lasted about\
  \ 8 months. I left the South of Brazil and headed north through the West. I did\
  \ not have the money to make this trip, but I had curiosity and creativity. With\
  \ a backpack full of courage and other indispensable instruments I threw myself\
  \ into the unknown.\n\nI did not know what cities I could reach, even though I had\
  \ made a road map beforehand. When I immersed myself in this experience I knew that\
  \ for financial reasons the destinations could be changed at any time. I was excited\
  \ to know the many regional differences in my country. I was excited to find myself\
  \ elsewhere. I was curious to know what the unknown reserved for me.\n\nTravel is\
  \ always a complete experience. It involves all our senses, sensations and subjective\
  \ reactions. Traveling is integrating the world into yourself. The unexpected changes\
  \ of course on this trip led me to meet amazing places that I had never heard of\
  \ before. I worked on things totally different from the ones I was used to. I tasted\
  \ flavors I had never tasted. I heard different accents, songs and sounds. My body\
  \ danced in rhythms unfamiliar to me.\n\nAp\xF3s seis meses viajando cheguei na\
  \ cidade de Bel\xE9m, uma das cidades mais importantes do norte do Brasil. Bem ali\
  \ na regi\xE3o amaz\xF4nica. Meu cora\xE7\xE3o estava em festa e a cidade tamb\xE9\
  m, n\xE3o porque eu havia chegado ali, mas porque era \xE9poca de uma das maiores\
  \ festas populares da regi\xE3o: The Arraial do Pavulagem fest. I was enchanted\
  \ with all those people in colorful clothes and ribbons, holding scepters adorned\
  \ with sun and lunar symbols of Amazonian indigenous cultures. To dance to the sound\
  \ of Carimb\xF3 that is one of Brazil's immaterial patrimony  is to discover that\
  \ even if you are not close to the dance, your body will still want to dance.\n\n\
  And if one day you have the opportunity to taste a plant called Jambu do not miss\
  \ this opportunity. It is a unique experience. This plant will broaden your taste\
  \ perception. The Jambu will bring to your mouth a slight sensation of heat and\
  \ tingling, it is a different sensation, but very interesting. It opens the papillae\
  \ of your tongue sharpening your palate. Incomparable experience!\n\nI recommend\
  \ that you get to know the biggest street fair in Latin America. Knowing the Ver-o-Peso\
  \ fair is plunging through scents and Amazon fragrances that you will not feel anywhere\
  \ else. To taste the fruits and the craft beers of the Amazon is to present to your\
  \ body flavors that he will never forget. Or simply head to the huge rivers that\
  \ cut through the city of Bel\xE9m and watch the rain show that falls by 4:00 pm\
  \ and lasts about 15 minutes everyday in the same hour. It's beautiful! But above\
  \ all this, be open to knowing the unknown.\n\nTaking a leap into the unknown showed\
  \ me different ways of knowing the places, but also the people. In the last six\
  \ months of traveling through the West and North of Brazil I realized that I wanted\
  \ more. That's when I started going out to the busiest places in the cities with\
  \ the purpose of getting to know that culture. How I did this? Knowing and talking\
  \ to people. As in performance act I put a plaque hanging on my body with the following\
  \ question: \"What is your dream?\". People's dreams tell a lot about who they are,\
  \ who they want to be and where they are.  It was in these conversations that I\
  \ also met people who happily told me about all the wonderful culture of their cities.\n\
  \nGradually what was unknown became a source of inspiration. I was always on the\
  \ best track because whoever told me about knew exactly how to get there or what\
  \ to do there. When I set out to listen to people's dreams I understood my own desires.\
  \ Sometimes, only a leap into the unknown is capable of making us see with new eyes\
  \ what we thought we knew."
