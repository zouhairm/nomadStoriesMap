Text: "Growing up, I was a short bike away from my grandparent\u2019s home in the\
  \ east end of Toronto. In their adopted country of Canada, they purchased a small\
  \ but mighty semi-detached home, booming with traditional folk music and wafting\
  \ of home cooked meals, all while preserving the small village feel in an unfamiliar,\
  \ big city. \n\nThroughout my youth and into my teenage years, I spent every Sunday\
  \ afternoon in my grandparent\u2019s company. Alongside my siblings and cousins,\
  \ I was captivated by my grandmother\u2019s storytelling. The traditions, the celebrations,\
  \ the music, and the food! Her eyes would dance and her face would glow as she reminisced\
  \ on stories in broken English of the subjects she would learn in school, when she\
  \ first met my grandfather, and the dancing, of course, the dancing. \n\nEven though\
  \ I had never travelled to Macedonia before, I always felt a sense of familiarity\
  \ and comfort with hearing the name of my family\u2019s village. With their upbringing\
  \ and family life being vastly different compared to mine in Canada, I wanted my\
  \ own eyes to see what this other world was. \n\nWhile backpacking through Europe\
  \ in my early twenties, I was living the backpacker\u2019s dream: searching for\
  \ the cheapest plane or bus ticket to get me around the continent, hostel hopping\
  \ from city to city, and finding friendship in international strangers, who were\
  \ like myself, craving adventure.\_Moving into my sixth month of solo travel, the\
  \ feeling of missing home and family began to resonate deeply with me. As I would\
  \ venture through similar Balkan countries, I would often be reminded of my grandmother\u2019\
  s cooking and the traditional music, eventually pulling me to make the trip to Macedonia.\
  \ \n\nI knew visiting the village would be both an exciting and emotional experience.\
  \ My father, who had not been back since the 1980s, travelled alongside me. With\
  \ little confidence speaking the language, I spent hours quietly walking around\
  \ the village. With my heart full and eyes wide, I soaked in every corner of the\
  \ small knit village. With each passing street, I could hear my grandmother in her\
  \ thick accent, animatedly sharing how close her cousin lived to her doorstep, or\
  \ the route they would take to walk to class. \n\nComing back home to Canada, I\
  \ was equipped with new memories from an old village. Now, years have passed and\
  \ as my family continues to grow, we begin to write new stories to share, always\
  \ with back home in mind."
