Text: "Charles Darwin said it\u2019s those most adaptable to change who survive. \
  \ \n\nSix months ago, I broke away from a financially-sound government job helping\
  \ abused children of Victoria. External factors like the loss of my grandparents\
  \ inspired me to resign, absent any future prospects. I wanted to go back to their\
  \ homes in Mauritius, but work tied me down.\n\nI still wanted to help people, but\
  \ I needed a change.\n\nSince then, a lot has happened. I went to Chile, ate empanadas\
  \ and hiked summits. I snorkelled with endangered marine life along the Great Barrier\
  \ Reef. I wandered through the lush ancient Daintree Rainforest. I walked about\
  \ Uluru. I flew to Mauritius, spent cherished time with family and knelt for hours\
  \ at my grandmother\u2019s delayed Buddhist funeral. I side-stepped to \xCEle Rodrigues,\
  \ embracing the laid-back pace of life. Over New Year\u2019s, I hiked with cherished\
  \ friends across Ben Boyd National Park, starting 2019 on a beach to ourselves,\
  \ staring into the depths of the visible Milky Way, pondering the meaning of life.\n\
  \nSomewhere throughout the gallivanting, I decided the instability was counterproductive\
  \ to self-development. Darting across backdrops every week was fun, but I needed\
  \ time to think. Back home in Melbourne, distraction plagued me; friends beckoning\
  \ every night to hang out, endless notifications, always something new on Netflix,\
  \ and forever a corner to clean in my apartment.\n\nI was in a life crisis, living\
  \ exclusively in the present. I rarely planned further than a few weeks ahead. Existentially,\
  \ I had no guarantee the future even existed. So what to do and where to go?\n\n\
  I wanted to find the alliterative Es of life: to explore where I came from, escape\
  \ the concrete jungle, and exist anew. \n\nThat\u2019s when the unknown of the Gal\xE1\
  pagos started to make a lot of sense. \n\nAn equatorial archipelago 900km west of\
  \ mainland Ecuador, the Gal\xE1pagos houses a vast array of unique life and terrestrial\
  \ phenomena. It inspired Charles Darwin to develop his Theory of Evolution by Natural\
  \ Selection. And while Darwin\u2019s discovery transpired 184 years ago, I convinced\
  \ myself I could still find a new perspective on reality by visiting the islands\
  \ in 2019.\n\nTourists spend on average little over a week on the archipelago, rushing\
  \ through hotspots, scavenging for iconic marine iguanas, sea lions and blue-footed\
  \ boobies. I spent a month. It\u2019s one thing to capture sea lions resting along\
  \ the pier. It\u2019s another to find time to swim with them, observe their mannerisms,\
  \ and grow accustomed to their dynamics. Immersed in this lifestyle, reflecting\
  \ daily on how paradise affected me, I discovered the underlying beauty of the Gal\xE1\
  pagos and its application to my life.\n\nI\u2019ve always loved writing. I wasn\u2019\
  t exceptional, but I never gave myself an opportunity to harness my skills and achieve\
  \ much. I consumed Stephen King, Harper Lee, and George Orwell. I saw in them perfection,\
  \ without asking how it came to be, as Friedrich Nietzche once said. Their talents\
  \ and genius eluded me.\n\nImmersed in the tranquillity of the islands, I learned\
  \ to slow things down and appreciate things that take millions of years. In the\
  \ Gal\xE1pagos, fast food is sparse, fast internet is sparser. I found myself developing\
  \ a different routine. I walked for hours each day. I passed evenings with locals\
  \ without ever checking the time. I observed animals without restriction, revisiting\
  \ remote destinations of hour-long trails, opened to epiphanies on each journey.\
  \ \n\nFor all the deliberate slowness, I discovered that beauty takes time and hard\
  \ work. \n\nWhile the islands are beautiful now, their true beauty rests in the\
  \ millions of years of nature\u2019s \"best of times and worst of times\" that have\
  \ crafted what they are and what they will be tomorrow. Likewise, my writing must\
  \ endure such a journey. Just as the Gal\xE1pagos doesn\u2019t arise from the ocean\
  \ floor overnight, my dream of becoming an accomplished writer doesn\u2019t manifest\
  \ in the writing of a handful of articles. A mountain of hard work lies ahead. And\
  \ it\u2019s better yet to climb this mountain than to have never tried at all.\n\
  \nThe future is uncertain. But in knowing this uncertainty, I\u2019ve resolved to\
  \ adapt towards becoming an accomplished writer, just as marine iguanas have adapted\
  \ to swim."
