Text: "In every place we can find a world with all untold stories of a town or place\
  \ when it gets dark.\nSo here I wanna show you the real face of the world without\
  \ any special gift that I drawn from my people who around me but I can help you\
  \ to get it there and experience all I know about this magical world.\nYou know\
  \ it\u2019s good to be bad because we all learn from our mistakes and that\u2019\
  s makes us wiser or at least we ll do something better than nothing. So I started\
  \ my journey from the basement of the world and that\u2019s the place where almost\
  \ people live their life with all love and care.\nHere we can see different types\
  \ of people with different religions with different opinions and culture but moreover\
  \ we are humans and I can see here a lots of people who working all day long to\
  \ raise their family to make better life.\nThey don\u2019t even know the world changed\
  \ with all new technologies but still they are trying harder to make a mark on their\
  \ chapter of book. \nI can see their smile on their face may be they are just faking\
  \ to hide their emotions and don\u2019t wanna share that with you or to other people\
  \ who are not at all concerned about their life.\nI can see their tears on their\
  \ face that doesn\u2019t mean they are sad may be Yes but some time happiness makes\
  \ us to cry and some time they just need a companion or a tight hug to ensure that\
  \ everything will be fine."
