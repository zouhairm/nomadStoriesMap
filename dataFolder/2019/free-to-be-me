Text: "Have you ever wondered if you were born in the wrong place? Every since I was\
  \ a little girl, I\u2019ve had an attraction to the unknown and the \u201Cyet\u201D\
  \ to be discovered. I\u2019d imagine what life was like outside of my very small\
  \ city. Daydreaming about a place out there with greenery everywhere and animals\
  \ roaming freely was a daily activity, right up there with brushing my teeth. How\
  \ restricted is a safari? I couldn\u2019t answer that either. But a leap into another\
  \ country would solve all of that. Of all places Uganda! Some would say to be the\
  \ \u201CMother Land\u201D yes! That\u2019s were I am headed. After a long flight,\
  \ and slight pains all over my body from the cramped seats on the airplane; I\u2019\
  ve arrived. Even from the tiny airplane window I could tell it was worth the long\
  \ flight it took to get here. Just as I imagined. Greenery everywhere, and coming\
  \ from a girl who grew up in Las Vegas, Nevada, it doesn\u2019t take much for me\
  \ to appreciate what Mother Nature could do. I was so excited to be stepping into\
  \ a country filled with color. \u201CNo desert landscape here\u201D I thought to\
  \ myself. What to do now hmmm, FOOD! Yes, what is visiting a place with very rich\
  \ culture without tasting it\u2019s very rich culture? Just the thought made my\
  \ tummy grumble. I settled on the first restaurant I saw. I assumed it to be very\
  \ popular by the crowd. As I maneuvered my way past the crowd, I noticed that there\
  \ wasn\u2019t anyone seating customers. I scanned the place to see if I could pick\
  \ up on the custom of the locals. Seem to me that people are just finding a place\
  \ to sit. Just as the thought crossed my mind, I was approached by a big beautiful\
  \ dark woman with a beautiful big smile. \u201CCan I help you?\u201D I told her\
  \ I was hungry and I wasn\u2019t sure what to eat, she suggested Bunny Chow. That\
  \ sounds filling enough. She motioned for me to follow her as she showed me to a\
  \ cozy seat and table toward the back. She asked me where I was from. I complimented\
  \ her thick but lovely accent and started a conversation which her. Hours passed\
  \ as I ate the flavorful delicious bunny chow and chatted with the waitress between\
  \ her serving customers. She offered to show me around to great destinations. I\
  \ accepted, besides I hadn\u2019t planned anything out and am completely winging\
  \ this trip. Early the next morning, I received a call that woke me up in a panic.\
  \ I looked at the time and it said 5:45 am. The frustration set in instantaneously.\
  \ Who could possibly be calling at this hour? I picked up the phone and on the other\
  \ end was a voice much too excited for the hour. I quickly realized by the accent\
  \ that it was the waitress from the restaurant. Even her phone voice had the same\
  \ affect that her smile had. You couldn\u2019t help but become excited right along\
  \ with her. She said to get ready for a safari. Over the next few days we would\
  \ explore so much of Africa that I began to feel like a local. I felt so at home,\
  \ and at peace. Who would\u2019ve thought that I came here to find a new place and\
  \ ended up finding myself."
