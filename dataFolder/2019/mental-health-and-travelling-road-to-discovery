Text: "For the last 3 years I have suffered massively from mental health issues (depression,\
  \ anxiety etc), my life felt limited, and I confided to the comfort of my bedroom,\
  \ which in turn made my symptoms worse. I was too depressed to do anything, or find\
  \ joy in anything, I was close to suicide, I knew something had to change. \n\n\
  I got inspired by the book 'into the wild', and after reading several other self-help\
  \ books, I saw the light, the only way to get myself out of this mental state and\
  \ runt was to push myself, seek new challenges, see new things. \nLast year I climbed\
  \ Ben Nevis for 'The mental Health Foundation' and raised \xA32000, this liberating\
  \ experience was beneficial for not only the charity, but myself.  \nWith this in\
  \ mind I started to push myself and seek new environments, by mental health issues\
  \ slowly disappeared. It was comforting to not be defined by my past pain, find\
  \ myself, and be thankful that I had the opportunity to explore. The ideal of exploration\
  \ and escapism was the single thing that gave all my pain a flick of comfort and\
  \ motivation. \n\nThis profound experience and led to travelling being my life,\
  \ my fuel and my medicine. On top of this the comfort of writing, and putting my\
  \ thoughts into words, has been therapeutic, and made me a more thoughtful and ambitious\
  \ person, something that my mental health craves everyday.  \nTo be able to combine\
  \ these two passions and life lines into a travel writing scholarship would be absolute\
  \ dream for me, and something that would change and empower every fibre of my existence."
