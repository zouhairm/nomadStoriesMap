Text: "When you think of India, what\u2019s the first place that comes to your mind.\
  \ Now move to the second one- the colourful bylanes of Rajasthan. Jaipur - the pink\
  \ city is my inspiration and I feel that deserves a mention among the crowded cities\
  \ of India. I studied in Jaipur for three years and I despised it as soon as I arrived\
  \ there. After a few months and after finding the right company and early morning\
  \ trips to the whole Nahargarh-Jaigarh-Amer circuit and witnessing some breathtaking\
  \ views, jaipur grew on me. The constants were Rawat Kachori, bake hut at MI road\
  \ , rose lassi at Bapu bazaar, golgappas outside Sarogi Mansion and lots and lots\
  \ of Mirch ka achar. Someone told me that there is a Ganesh temple (Garh Ganesh)\
  \ in the centre and it\u2019s believed that that makes it difficult for people to\
  \ forget Jaipur. It was tough to leave college but Jaipur remained. Somewhere in\
  \ my heart. I went again with a dear friend  and then again on my own and then countless\
  \ times coz Jaipur is a treasure of heritage I miss in my own city. I had so much\
  \ fun playing dress up and posing in front of all the wonderful places that I have\
  \ been to. The colourful Patrika Gate , the dreamy Saheliyon ka Bagh, the mesmerising\
  \ Amer Fort where you can\u2019t stop taking pictures and the really fancy private\
  \ tour at City Palace. The four gates based on the seasons of India are carefully\
  \ crafted and designed . You have to literally stand there and have a window of\
  \ 10 seconds to move on because there is a crowd of amateur and professional photographers\
  \ ready to kill to take a nice picture without people. I have a series that I started\
  \ on Instagram called The tale of a Dancing Queen which became an instant hit as\
  \ I posed in front of all the Instaworthy places. There are small cute shops that\
  \ sell the most amazing textiles, block print , jewelry, sarees that probably no\
  \ one knows about. Atleast no one that I know is acquainted with them. @anokhijaipur\
  \ is one of the ethical stores that I know that sells but most of all takes care\
  \ of the local artisans. I went to their museum which is also a UNESCO world heritage\
  \ site built inside a 150 year old Haveli. I tried my hand at block printing as\
  \ well and the artisans are quite grateful for how the organisation function. And\
  \ the food, well I am off most of the food but couldn\u2019t keep my hands off the\
  \ laal maas and Kachori. One thing I am yet to do is visit the inside of Hawa Mahal.\
  \ I have heard it\u2019s quite wonderful. Perhaps next time. On this last visit\
  \ , I had a special breakfast at @fairmontjaipurindia which is a heritage hotel.\
  \ It will blow your mind literally. If you have ever seen the Jaipur filter on Insta\
  \ stories and if you see my pictures of Jaipur you would see that it\u2019s quite\
  \ spot on. @instagram has done a wonderful job in creating the absolute Jaipur Filter.\
  \ I would love to visit  time. I really wanted to get married there. But I would\
  \ love to spend a quite weekend and immerse myself in the Aravalli range. The hotels\
  \ I feel can make it break your trip and one such way of making the most of a heritage\
  \ city is that I divided my days in different hotels to get a feel of the best of\
  \ Jaipur. You go to vintage Narain Niwas Palace and go all royal or stay at 28 Kothi\
  \ which is a chic Boutique hotel tastefully decorated in the most quirky artefacts.\
  \ All in all I can say that your heart would be warmed by the quintessential Rajasthani\
  \ welcome and the hottest chilies in Laal Maas. Jaipur. You have been an amazing\
  \ host. Until next time, you have my heart and soul."
