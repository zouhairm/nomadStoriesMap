Text: "I befriended a butterfly in Beijing.  As a freelance international wine and\
  \ spirits judge my nose often brings me places that I never dared to dream, but\
  \ in between the sips and spits I have had the pleasure of discovering creatures\
  \ more precious than awarded medals.\n\n\tDuring a wine trip to the Republic of\
  \ Georgia it appeared as if the animals all had their own agenda.  Herds of cows\
  \ slowly traipsed sans herder in the middle of the road in front of our bus.  Two\
  \ thin old dogs lay quietly dignified in the dirt without so much as a whimper towards\
  \ our alfresco table that was heaped with grilled meats, vegetable spreads, and\
  \ long slender bread.  And then there was Chacha.  In Georgia Chacha refers to a\
  \ strong grape spirit made from the leftovers from wine production, but for thirty\
  \ minutes during a winemaker\u2019s discussion this particular Chacha was actually\
  \ the next door neighbor\u2019s grey tabby kitten who circled around the sealed\
  \ qvevri inspecting the work with her tail held high in the air before deciding\
  \  to plop down into my lap kneading her tiny claws into my brown linen dress while\
  \ I alternated between note taking, petting, and finishing up with a taste of tarragon\
  \ flavored Chacha (the non-kitten variety.)  We left the earthenware qvevri behind\
  \ and buried in the ground forming amber wines much like cocoons that allow you\
  \ to drink the butterfly and moved to the shade by the well to escape the sweltering\
  \ heat.  The winemaker pulleyed up a submerged basket of his wines from below, and\
  \ we explored the potential of these indigenous grapes of Kakheti while being treated\
  \ to his fresh homemade cheese (of which I snuck little nibbles to my mewing feline\
  \ friend under the table.)  During this time I felt that I could start a new life\
  \ in this backyard, but five minutes later reality set in, and with teary eyes I\
  \ whispered in Chacha\u2019s left ear that I loved her and was back on the bus for\
  \ the next wine lesson.\n\n\tIn front of high-ranking Chinese business men, as well\
  \ as approximately 320 wine judges from around the world, the opening presentation\
  \ climaxed with hundreds of butterflies released inside the building and into the\
  \ crowd.  Haidian district in Beijing is known for advanced technology and had provided\
  \ this 25th annual wine competition with scientifically enhanced experiences such\
  \ as facial recognition security, a water robot serving all hydration needs, and\
  \ massive glowing screens flanking the back of the entire stage. Upon liberation\
  \ most butterflies acted more as moths to a flame and immediately carpeted the gleaming\
  \ screens.\n\n\tAs I turned to leave I noticed a lone butterfly, wings gently flapping\
  \ and perched on one of the many rows of white chairs which were quickly being stacked\
  \ and ushered away.  There wasn\u2019t much time.  I extended my right index finger\
  \ and asked it if it would like a ride.  Surprisingly it hopped aboard.  Soon we\
  \ were slipping past the facial recognition security and taking a full ten minute\
  \ walk inside the palatial resort.  It never flew away. Exiting out the back door\
  \ and moving towards the pond I began to mingle and introduce it to a few fellow\
  \ wine judges.  It still didn\u2019t fly away.  Next we began to take lots of photos\
  \ together.  It never budged.  In fact, at this moment, the lovely creature with\
  \ vibrant orange stripes and scalloped black tips began unrolling its tongue and\
  \ appeared to taste me!  Perhaps the scent of Chinese ice wine still lingered on\
  \ my fingers.  How long does a butterfly live?  It seemed to be spending the most\
  \ of it with me.  I needed to say my goodbyes and enter the chandeliered tent to\
  \ attend a seminar on wine regions in China.  I carried the butterfly to a green\
  \ leafy plant beside the pond and later noticed that the gray linen dress with billowing\
  \ sleeves that I was wearing made me look as if I had wings of my own."
