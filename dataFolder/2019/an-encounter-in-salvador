Text: "People go to Salvador, Brazil for its cerulean beaches, colonial architecture,\
  \ and Afro-Brazilian culture. People like me, though, go for the history.\n\nOn\
  \ a Fulbright scholarship to research the biography of renowned Brazilian psychiatrist\
  \ Nise da Silveira, I spent 2018 jet setting across the country in search of dusty\
  \ archives that might tell me anything about her early life. And since Nise attended\
  \ university at Salvador\u2019s Faculdade de Medicina da Bahia, Brazil\u2019s first\
  \ medical school, the city was an important destination. \n\nUpon my arrival, I\
  \ was directed to Cristina, the school\u2019s head archivist. As it happened, it\
  \ was a big day for Cristina, who was leading a ceremony to rename the graduate\
  \ studies room. A stout woman, perhaps in her early 70s, with large eyes magnified\
  \ by even larger glasses, she commanded the attention of a group of professors.\n\
  \n\u201CA few years ago, I found a document that haunted me.\u201D\n\nIt had to\
  \ do with Ephigenia Veiga, the top student in the class of 1890, who lost out on\
  \ a prestigious award due to the faculty\u2019s sexism. \u201CToday, we attempt\
  \ to right that injustice,\u201D Cristina proclaimed, pulling a cloth off the wall\
  \ to reveal a plaque in Ephigenia\u2019s honor. Everyone applauded. Cristina grinned\
  \ victoriously.\n\nAs the crowd dissipated, I introduced myself.\n\n\u201CSo you\u2019\
  re the American who studies Nise.\u201D She\u2019d been expecting me, she said,\
  \ adding, \u201CYou\u2019re right to come to the source. People so rarely do that.\u201D\
  \ \n\nShe beckoned me to her office, pointing out portraits on the way, and complimenting\
  \ my \u201Cgood for an American\u201D Portuguese. She shared how, in preparation\
  \ for my visit, she\u2019d compiled a list of all the women to attend the university\
  \ from its founding through the early 1900s, as well as the titles of theses with\
  \ women-centered themes. Furthermore, she was so impressed by my interest in the\
  \ school\u2019s history that she invited me to view a room of closed-off archives.\
  \ I asked if she wanted to get lunch first, and she shook off the idea. \u201CI\
  \ eat a big breakfast so that I can work all day. People like us \u2014 we can live\
  \ on history alone.\u201D\n\nShe led me to a room with ceiling-high shelves stuffed\
  \ with accordion folders, each containing thousands of files. Over the next hours,\
  \ Cristina masterfully located documents pertaining to Nise\u2019s schooling. Together,\
  \ we reconstructed Nise\u2019s class schedule from 100 years ago.\n\nOver the following\
  \ days, Cristina took me under her wings. I loved watching her become giddy over\
  \ tiny historical details. A photograph of two 19th century professors \u201Cwho\
  \ definitely hated each other\u201D standing side-by-side could prompt uproarious\
  \ laughter. Busts of long-dead faculty could turn a walk down a short hallway into\
  \ a twenty-minute adventure.\n\nThe walls inspired reflection, too. \u201CJesuits\
  \ built all this, you know.\u201D The building, she noted, was originally a monastery,\
  \ dating back to the 1500s. She gestured to a stone-rimmed cavity outside. \u201C\
  That\u2019s a Jesuit well.\u201D\n\nOn my final day in Salvador, she took me to\
  \ Museu de Arqueologia e Etnologia, located in the narrow passageways beneath the\
  \ school. Winding through the museum\u2019s stone archways, we came to a brick wall.\
  \ Her raised eyebrows and pensive hands revealed that something on her mind.\n\n\
  \u201CDon\u2019t you see?\u201D she practically exploded. \u201CThese are Jesuit\
  \ tunnels!\u201D\n\nIn the 1500s, she elaborated, under constant threat of Dutch\
  \ attack, the Jesuits constructed underground escape routes connecting all the monasteries\
  \ and churches in the area. \n\n\u201CThey continue through this wall?\u201D I asked,\
  \ gesturing in front of us.\n\nShe flashed a conniving smile. Uncovering the tunnels,\
  \ she explained, would be incredibly expensive, and would require shutting down\
  \ the city\u2019s business center. \u201CWe\u2019ll probably never know where those\
  \ Jesuits were going to run.\u201D\n\nThe moment stuck with me, especially two weeks\
  \ later, back in Rio, when I heard from the school\u2019s librarian. Cristina had\
  \ suddenly passed away. The librarian thought I would want to know.\n\nI thought\
  \ back to our last moment together. Exiting the museum, I thanked her for all her\
  \ help. \u201CJust write that biography,\u201D she stated. She gave me a kiss on\
  \ each cheek and disappeared up a stone staircase to return to her work."
