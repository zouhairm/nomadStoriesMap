Text: "We both know it when we taste it: these are the best tacos in Tulum. On the\
  \ surface, they don\u2019t look much different than all the others. Same two-layer\
  \ corn tortillas. Same crunchy white cabbage, same sprinkle of fresh cilantro. Same\
  \ plastic-wrapped plate, even. But this spit-shaven pork is tender, fatty and deeply\
  \ marinated in a way that no other taco has tasted yet. And to top it all off \u2013\
  \ literally \u2013 there\u2019s a thin slice of sweet pineapple garnished on each\
  \ little masterpiece. \n\nTulum is no longer a secret destination for vacationers\
  \ or backpackers \u2013 its beach strip is one of the fastest growing 10 square\
  \ kilometers in Mexico\u2019s Maya Riviera. My travel partner and I chose to stay\
  \ at a hostel in town, and away from the luxury beach resorts, we discovered that\
  \ the pueblo of Tulum had a humble charm, a vibrant local population, and incredible\
  \ taquerias. \n\nThe problem was, we couldn\u2019t find them. \n\nWe were starving,\
  \ just off a bumpy bus ride, and all we could see in the glaring sun was an invasion\
  \ of upscale restaurants offering French and Italian cuisine. But we\u2019d already\
  \ set our rules: no pizza, no pasta. We were here for the tacos, and were willing\
  \ to settle for the Clif bars I stashed in my carry-on if we couldn't find them.\n\
  \nWe arrived hungry, and sun-struck back at our hostel, where we met our guide and\
  \ roommate, Natalia. Natalia had caramel skin, and a mane of kinky hair \u2013 she\
  \ was a long-stayer at the hostel and quickly explained the failure our daytime\
  \ taco quest: taquerias only open after dark. \n\nAs the vivid orange and purple\
  \ streaks faded in the sky, Natalia led us to Gran Promocion: a two-room taco restaurant\
  \ on a dusty side-street. It had red walls and low ceilings. Its dining room was\
  \ crowded with tired-looking Mexican construction workers gazing at the TV on the\
  \ far wall, eating in near silence like they were in their own kitchens after a\
  \ long day. I glanced over my shoulders, and the men offered me soft smiles. We\
  \ were three young women, out in shorts and tank-tops after dark, in a roomful of\
  \ men. Somehow, I\u2019d never felt so safe. \n\nThe following night, we set out\
  \ to try the taco-carts that formed a train of mini-kitchens around the town square.\
  \ I asked for two tacos at the only stand operated by two women. The chef smiled\
  \ from behind waxy red lipstick and slapped eight tortillas on the heat. \n\nWhen\
  \ I tentatively dipped a plastic spoon in the three salsas on display, her partner\
  \ wiped her hands on a pink apron and pointed only to the red bowl. \u201CPiquante!\u201D\
  \ she said, wagging her finger like we were her mischievous children. We blushed.\
  \ Then the chef passed us four tacos each. \n\nOn our last night in Tulum, we passed\
  \ a narrow kitchen with a single rotating spit, probably the tenth time we walked\
  \ by. While other taquerias had at least a dozen mismatched plastic tables and chairs,\
  \ this one had a single table with a white tablecloth, as if it was waiting for\
  \ a couple on a special occasion. As the waiter took away our single plate, we said\
  \ to him, \u201CMuy, muy Bueno. Muchos gracias!\u201D He squinted his eyes and bowed\
  \ in thank you. They were the best tacos in Tulum.\n\nOn Friday, we swished through\
  \ the automatic doors at the Cancun airport and, at the sight of Starbucks, slumped\
  \ our shoulders. It was a reminder of the anonymous international food we'd been\
  \ avoiding all week. But we needed coffee. A cheery young Mexican woman with the\
  \ peppy face of a garden-gnome greeted me. \u201CEspresso y un pochito leche?\u201D\
  \ I asked, reciting the words a barista in town taught me. She smiled at my feeble\
  \ Spanish and held a small cup up cheerfully, sharpie poised to write my name. She\
  \ was as courteous and sunny as our taco vendors, perfectly buoyant in her job.\
  \ And then I knew that we wouldn't miss Mexico\u2019s flavours most \u2013 it was\
  \ the soft-spoken, attentive people that we wouldn't soon forget."
