Text: "I\u2019d been on the back of a motorcycle before\u2014many times, in fact:\
  \ my dad\u2019s ridden one since I was twelve. But on the front of one? On the wrong\
  \ side of the road? On busy streets? In a foreign country I\u2019d only entered\
  \ two days prior? \n\nThe Thai men renting scooters along the roadside looked me\
  \ up and down as I handed them the few Baht required to borrow the half-motorcycle\
  \ half-Vespa contraption that reached speeds upward of 80 km per hour. All the other\
  \ women traveling in my group had opted to ride with their husbands, but I wanted\
  \ to ride my own. The stares I was receiving made me immediately wonder if I\u2019\
  d made the right decision, and when I sat down on my scooter, tapped the gas, and\
  \ it tried to escape from under me, I got really worried. \n\n\u201CIt\u2019s just\
  \ like riding a bike,\u201D I told myself. \u201CA really fast, death-trap of a\
  \ bike\u2026 On streets with much bigger vehicles trying to get somewhere in much\
  \ more of a hurry\u2026 You\u2019ll be fine.\u201D \n\nThe group was ready to go;\
  \ the plan was to head through town to a beach that boasted amazing views\u2014\
  about an hour\u2019s ride away. So, after having had only a few minutes\u2019 practice\u2014\
  getting a better handle on exactly how much gas was needed to go, yet not so much\
  \ the bike would take off without me\u2014I followed the group of far-more-experienced\
  \ riders to the main road, and we were off. \n\nThis first road had resorts along\
  \ the left side and the ocean along the right. Traffic was minimal and we could\
  \ just drive and enjoy the view. I\u2019d say my hair was blowing in the sea breeze\
  \ and I felt footloose and fancy-free, but really, my knuckles were white as they\
  \ gripped the motorcycle\u2019s handles, my hair was matted with sweat under my\
  \ helmet, and I didn\u2019t dare let myself even glance at anything but the road\
  \ in front of me as I kept my focus acutely on how much gas I was giving and trying\
  \ to remember which doohickey was the brake. \n\nAs the resorts disappeared behind\
  \ us, busier roads came into view. And they were smaller too. More lanes, less space,\
  \ higher speeds. My heartbeat started a drum solo. \n\n\u201CJust don\u2019t lose\
  \ the group. Don\u2019t lose the group. Don\u2019t lose the group,\u201D I repeated\
  \ to myself now. I tailed my husband\u2019s bike as if my life depended on it. I\
  \ didn\u2019t want to think about how much it actually did. Cars and trucks sped\
  \ by us, around us, into lanes that definitely didn\u2019t exist. There were traffic\
  \ lights, signs, and markings, but apparently no rules. People went where they wanted,\
  \ how they wanted, and as fast as they wanted. I didn\u2019t even know where I was\
  \ heading, never mind how to get there. The back of my husband\u2019s motorcycle\
  \ was all that mattered, as he followed the one in front of him. \n\nAt red lights\
  \ that weren\u2019t being ignored, I took in the bustle of the town. Most of the\
  \ shops looked temporary, sort of like food trucks back home, but if the trucks\
  \ were wagons and huts. The buildings were all tiny\u2014none of them more than\
  \ two or three storeys maximum\u2014and made out of what seemed to be clay or cement.\
  \ And everyone was on the move. \n\nWe were through the main part of town within\
  \ twenty or so minutes, though, when you\u2019re counting your every breath, time\
  \ seems to pass a lot slower. And just as I thought the most terrifying part of\
  \ the trip was behind us, we started along the beachside highways. I felt invincible\
  \ now though, as if I could do anything. So I watched with glee as my speedometer\
  \ reached 80\u2026 85\u2026 90\u2026 100. It was exhilarating. The wind had a saltiness\
  \ to it as I ripped through it and smiled. This was living. \n\nWe finally reached\
  \ the beach and the views did not disappoint, but I was eager to get back on my\
  \ bike and do the ride all over again. I hadn\u2019t realized my own courage until\
  \ that day, and now I\u2019ll never forget it."
