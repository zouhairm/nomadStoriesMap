Text: "Can a travel to unknown country feel like a trip to your grandparents? \n\n\
  Yes! \nIf you are traveling to a gorgeous city of Odessa in Ukraine.\nYou\u2019\
  ll be given a free and warm hug upon arrival from it\u2019s weather.\nHeedful taxi\
  \ drivers will give a feeling of long awaited arrival.\nAnd you will be struggling\
  \ to leave Odessa without few extra kilos of bodyweight, because it\u2019s one of\
  \ the pound for pound best cities for gastronomic tourism!\nJust look at this mix\
  \ of cuisines, which you can find on every corner \u2013 Jewish, Ukrainian, Russian,\
  \ Mediterranean, Caucasian & Turkic.   \nBesides that it\u2019s all mega-delicious,\
  \ the city has mentality of Jewish Mommas, whose philosophy based on a concrete\
  \ belief \u2013 \u201Cwherever the case, everyone should be well fed\u201D.\nThis\
  \ means that wherever you go \u2013 business meeting or an art event it, will be\
  \ served with appealing food, so prepare your power of will before going to Odessa.\n\
  \nI love to discover new places from the inside, like a local.\nAnd I\u2019ll share\
  \ with you my proven method to get this experience.\nI call it \u2013 \u201Ccherche\
  \ des femmes\u201D. \nIn French it means search for women.\n\nWhy?\nWomen are better\
  \ informants and guides.\nThey are more friendly, outgoing, like to communicate\
  \ plus more emotional and helps to catch real rhythm of the city and it\u2019s feelings.\n\
  It\u2019s an easiest and fastest way to know what\u2019s going on here, where to\
  \ find best locations for photos and which place have the most interesting stories.\n\
  \nTo use this method in Odessa is a pure pleasure \u2013 local women are so fascinating!\n\
  Here you can find shocking concentration of beautiful girls and I\u2019m not exaggerating!\n\
  Most of them are tall, sporty, with charming smiles, hair & accents. \nAs in any\
  \ other sunny port cities, they are friendly and connectable.\nNo surprise that\
  \ this place is one of the world\u2019s top destinations for sex tourism. \nThe\
  \ local temper is absolutely unique. \n\nI can only explain it by two factors \u2013\
  \ warm sea & mix of different descents.\nFor many ages, Odessa been under impact\
  \ of Turkic, Polish, French, Greek & Russian invaders. \nDuring era of Soviet union\
  \ it been filled with thousands of Jewish families.\nUnstoppable assimilation between\
  \ so many cultures gave born to a special swagger for all Odessa\u2019s natives.\n\
  And of course it\u2019s affected people\u2019s looks. \n\nTo make right connections\
  \ \u2013 find an event with your interests and join it!\nU will meet a lot of co-thinkers\
  \ there, because the city has solid population for it\u2019s tiny size \u2013 more\
  \ than one million. \nThe second plus of this crowdedness is that everybody know\
  \ everybody, which allows you to build your new network faster.\nFor example, after\
  \ only one event in the city, I already met a person to film a video with me, a\
  \ girl to discover city sightings and local opinion leaders.\nThanks to these people,\
  \ I was able to plan my whole week in couple of hours.\nTo check events in new places\
  \ I use Facebook calendar.\n\nAlso I use Tinder app \u2013 it shows you people around\
  \ your location.\nIt\u2019s been really helpful in every city I used to visit.\n\
  So if you want to have new emotions and friends, I will highly recommend you to\
  \ visit Odessa.\nThis city is extra friendly and it has interesting historical roots,\
  \ check it out to feel real southern hospitality!\n\nBest regards, Said."
