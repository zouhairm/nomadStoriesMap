Text: "The contradiction in a matter of hours left us lost. Waking up with rain pouring\
  \ down the streets, running through the Iowan roads lost between North Clinton and\
  \ the Farmer\u2019s Market. Mapping around, crossing bridges repeatedly over the\
  \ green river that splits the city, and then without any notice the sun dries up\
  \ our clothes and banishes the rain. \nTwo days within one; Iowa City\u2019s summers\
  \ are calm and joyous. Streets are empty and days are long. What I enjoyed most\
  \ were the books; books all over and bookshops shattered across the streets. The\
  \ Haunted Bookshop was my shelter, an old three-story house, typical American design\
  \ with squeaky wooden stairs and huge puffy couches. Cats looming all over, with\
  \ their royal walks and curious looks. I\u2019ve spent hours there without noticing.\
  \ \nLeaving the bookshop, with a handful of books, I walk down the streets with\
  \ people I met days before. The connections built were sudden and instant, a feeling\
  \ of d\xE9j\xE0 vu stroke me upon our first encounter. They were very strange and\
  \ yet very familiar. What made us close in a matter of hours was the passion we\
  \ all shared, the passion for writing. \nAmbitious juvenile writers discovering\
  \ an UNESCO City of Literature, this had to be special. Finding us a home thousands\
  \ of miles away from our homelands, a home harnessed by words. Just outside Iowa\
  \ City lies a vast gleaming lake: Lake McBride. With artificial sand shores on one\
  \ of its edges and kayaks spreading all over. I had my first kayaking experience\
  \ at McBride, with another friend, doubtfully holding the paddle with hands nearly\
  \ shaking. And then all of a sudden, we were moving with the water, our skin radiating\
  \ with the sun and our hands swinging nonchalantly. \nWhat I loved about Iowa was\
  \ its simplicity. So easy to move through its perfectly aligned streets and yet\
  \ monotone was never there. Each house had its own flare, each building had its\
  \ special mural. Colors all over, even at night; this little spot had life circulating\
  \ its veins and had so much to tell. \nWe casually woke up at 7:00 a.m., had a quick\
  \ American breakfast, waffles with strawberry syrup or maybe cereals and a fruit\
  \ salad. And then we headed off towards a new adventure. I walked through the city\
  \ with my phone in my hand, taking photos at times and forgetting that the phone\
  \ existed at others. Shambaugh House was a daily checkpoint for us. An ancient house,\
  \ with scents coming from a long-lost past. You could see it was a writer\u2019\
  s lair without even getting in. A white porch, amidst which a wooden swing that\
  \ danced with the sunset breeze accompanied by total solemnity, calmness like no\
  \ other. \nAn old cemetery lies 20 minutes away on foot. Dating back to the 19th\
  \ century, it didn\u2019t look like any of the cemeteries I\u2019ve seen here in\
  \ Lebanon. Very authentic and extremely rooted to the city\u2019s beginnings. Inside\
  \ the cemetery, lies a round wooden pergola, that overlooked the whole property.\
  \ I stood there for minutes with my hands clenching hard to the railing refusing\
  \ to leave. This standing spot had induced all the inhibited words residing in my\
  \ mind, the scene was so beautiful and so sad as well. The contrast was huge, and\
  \ the stories that could be written were endless. \nThe 14 days passed rapidly,\
  \ I didn\u2019t know how to accept the reality of leaving, of packing up my bag\
  \ and turning off my room\u2019s light. It was just as leaving a home to move to\
  \ another one. Cars were ready to pick us up; hugs, laughs, and tears and then it\
  \ was over. I was in the SUV, looking through the window and grasping these small\
  \ little moments that remained. I saw the corn fields that were perfectly aligned.\
  \ They were mildly yellowish back then. I gave the wooden houses a final glance,\
  \ and the Leaving Iowa City sign was just ahead. Cedar Rapids airport here we go.\
  \ I turned backwards and looked through the car\u2019s back window. I felt just\
  \ like a small child leaving an amusement park forcibly. I took a deep sigh, closed\
  \ my eyes and smiled."
