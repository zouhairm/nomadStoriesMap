Text: "Back on the road, I broke into tears --- again.\n\n\"Why does it matter so\
  \ much to me? I've only known them for five minutes! Is it always going to be like\
  \ this!?\"\n\nThat's what I asked myself, copiously crying while pedaling away from\
  \ Tania, Natasha, and Valia.\n\nThis meaningful event took place in the otherwise\
  \ inconspicuous town of Kiliya, located half-the-way between the better-known Izmail\
  \ and Vylkove on the Ukrainian segment of the Danube Delta. I was a little over\
  \ a month into a cycle tour that had started in Serbia, taking me along the Danube\
  \ through Romania and into Ukraine. The tour would continue for another four months\
  \ around Eastern Europe and Scandinavia. I was traveling alone. Or was I?\n\nSaying\
  \ goodbye started getting difficult a few weeks before at a gas station in Romania\
  \ where I had stopped to borrow the Internet. On my way out, I noticed the owner\
  \ Martin shed a tear.\n\n\"Why are you crying?\"\n\n\"Because I just started getting\
  \ to know you, and now you are leaving.\"\n\nThat watered my own eyes. I was only\
  \ able to hold it for long enough to get out of Martin, and his brother Florin's\
  \ sight and then surrendered to the first weeping episode of the series leading\
  \ to the peak one in Kiliya.\n\nI had entered the shop where I met Tania, Natasha,\
  \ and Valia only to buy bread. But I couldn't contain their excitement. And it built\
  \ further up as I explained that I was a traveler originally from Brazil, cycling\
  \ my way across Eastern Europe, with the loose goal of eventually reaching North\
  \ Cape, in Norway.\n\nAs I was leaving, it hit me hard that I might never see any\
  \ of the countless people I meet along my way ever again. I felt lonely and insecure.\
  \ I naively wanted all those seeds to develop into lasting connections.\n\nA little\
  \ later, I ran into a large group of cycle travelers on holiday. As usual, I stopped\
  \ to share some bike-touring camaraderie. They were traveling in the opposite direction\
  \ towards Izmail, starting from Odessa. We traded information about our respective\
  \ roads ahead, took some photos, exchanged a few hugs, and wished each other a happy\
  \ ride. They gave me the map they didn't need anymore, which I later passed down\
  \ to another traveler when I didn't need it either.\n\n\"Oh, just one more thing\
  \ --- you'll probably pass by a store called Mahazyn Kashtan. If you need any food,\
  \ please buy it there, and tell Tania, Natasha, and Valia that Mika from Brazil\
  \ says hi!\"\n\nI don't know if they did. But that's what I decided to ask every\
  \ party of bike travelers I met riding in the opposite direction during those few\
  \ days between Izmail and Odessa. This scenic ride along the Ukrainian side of the\
  \ Danube River and the Black Sea turned out to be a popular cycling holiday destination\
  \ for Ukrainians.\n\nA few days later, I was refilling my water bottles at a roadside\
  \ restaurant in the village of Zatoka when I heard an excited call, \u201CBrazilia!\u201D\
  \ When I looked back, another two-wheeled traveler approached me, pointing to my\
  \ bicycle, and repeating, \u201CBrazilia!\u201D\n\nThat's what \"Brazil\" sounds\
  \ like in Slavic languages. But how could he have known?\n\nHis name was Zhenya,\
  \ and it turns out he had been to Mahazyn Kashtan a day after me. The owner showed\
  \ him photos of my cycle-touring rig, which he recognized by the distinct yellow\
  \ and red panniers.\n\nWhether or not the other riders were heeding my request to\
  \ visit the ladies in Kiliya, I felt like our brief encounter had not been insignificant\
  \ to them either.\n\nWhen Zhenya caught up with me, we were 60km away from Odessa.\
  \ We agreed to ride those together. We parted ways shortly after our arrival \u2014\
  \ I wanted a hot shower at my host's in the city, and he wanted one last cold dip\
  \ in the Black Sea before catching a train back home.\n\nThe overarching journey\
  \ is ultimately mine. But it can still be shared with others whenever and for however\
  \ long it intersects with theirs. I travel solo, not alone. And I'll cry if I have\
  \ to."
