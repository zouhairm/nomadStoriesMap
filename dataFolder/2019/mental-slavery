Text: "Laying next to my friends couch,travelling in an ecstacy of romantic motion\
  \ filled with bliss of greenery in the land of \"God's Own Country\" been in my\
  \ own thoughts revolving into the deep woods surrounded by locals of this village(KUTTANAD,KERALA).I\
  \ didn't know that I was studying the people's way of getting into their traditional\
  \ culture with the backwaters filled with upfloded water and pasture of green layering.May\
  \ be next I would like to head upon the fishing sector of this remote village,helping\
  \ my hands to make a sure catch for their lunch with a special place covered up\
  \ in a bushy hut with all support and love of family towards me.Thinking myself\
  \ 'what a shine' no poor resembles the way of treating others in a small way.Gradually\
  \ my will for the unhidden tracks updated and keeped on saying #it's on me whether\
  \ to head forward with your friend or alone,I decided to go solo from their burning\
  \ my head(blazing smoke)paved into a forest with a stranger of their own culture\
  \ and just wanna kiss the ground and lay down there itself like it's hoping to a\
  \ new world.I know it's hard to bring me Into this unknown path but my will re-exhuasted\
  \ and grabbed a fruit of muberry(crazy tastes).Guaranteed to my life with a dangerous\
  \ move through the forest with hiden burdens(snakes,big cats,puma etc.) covering\
  \ the ALAPPUZHA DISTRICT,in the state of KERALA,INDIA. But still ain't not fully\
  \ satisfied until I get to know about the lifestyle of people residing I those tough\
  \ nature areas where anything can happen at any time, risking their life and not\
  \ giving up on the climate changes with a crisscross support from the mighty God.\
  \ Took a like a shot but I fell down looking at the shot of a child sharing of a\
  \ few loaf of bread with their brothers and sisters,my eyes rolled up and nevertheless\
  \ I got to them and hold them together with a tight hug and made some super shots,\
  \ I learned and got so Inspired from small childrens,how much they value their belongings\
  \ and I am definitely giving a spik to my life wherein everything is such a lost.Begining\
  \ to the riverside of the rural area(CHENGAMPUZHA) in which I worried so much of\
  \ having this moments back again to share with ma friends and colleagues that always\
  \ revolved around me ,waking up the dawn chasing the Sun rays with 365 days to waste\
  \ on like a lifecycle from Monday to Sunday, let that stop. I want to be the one\
  \ who stayed on the night and day 24/7:365 days in that place where love is striken\
  \ on the environment grasping all the best ways of fulfilling our mother nature\
  \ prudently. Such a devoted peace of mind would never occur again in my life, I\
  \ keeped on asking the villagers don't you find hard to stay here without any modern\
  \ advancements or facilities of providing education to your children?The answer\
  \ I don't wanna have was that -We are happy with the god given riches mainly the\
  \ basic aninity of livelihood in such a wonderful place covered with only plants,trees,wild\
  \ animals,waterfalls,riverside,forest etc. We don't need any money for staying here\
  \ all the things are available in the nature itself \nI,myself got ashamed to here\
  \ about a specified answer from their mouth thats like strings getting  stronger\
  \ and stronger.My journey from ALAPPUZHA TO KOTTAYAM DISTRICT was like a tough stain\
  \ removal for me walking through the forests, but everything had its own story to\
  \ express their sanity of life, not only the humans but the non-living things also\
  \ said try me#funnyhah.My mind got torcherd and always urged the need of staying\
  \ up here I. these woods still I sucked up all the hard times and moved on till\
  \ the morning when the sun comes on! Feeling divine as god as delivered me his blessings\
  \ through these capturings of the real reality of the people residing in KUTTANAD\
  \ PLACE with backwater filled up nervously getting drown anytime between the small\
  \ space of land and water.Both are synchronised with the lives of those indulged\
  \ there whether bad or good happens,(we will die in this precious land of God's\
  \ Own Country,KERALA.\n                                              -JIBIN THOMAS"
