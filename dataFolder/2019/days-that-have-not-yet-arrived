Text: "True Colombia. Palm trees slowly swaying in the winds of the Caribbean Sea.\
  \ Pi\xF1a coladas in a hand-woven hammock. Sudden downpours when you wear your best\
  \ backpacker sandals. Hoards of resigned, stray dogs searching for any attention\
  \ at all. Spiky breadfruit. Rice. Loads of rice. Police-force giving out soft drinks\
  \ to the airport travellers. Dogs sleeping in check-in queues. 7-year-olds manning\
  \ the customer service points. Corn arepa. Too many arepas. Heart-breaking divisions.\
  \ Rich El Poblado with flax seed shakes and 'zoo-like' rides on the Parque Arvi\
  \ cable car. Stories of hope and despair that make you admire people of this land.\
  \ Medellin's metro system - an emblem of forward-thinking and a chance to bring\
  \ two worlds together. Lunches on removable Ford track seats. Mouth-watering steaks.\
  \ Not enough mouth-watering streaks. Buses. Long bus journeys. Too much and too\
  \ loud \u2018vallenato\u2019 on those bus journeys. Never enough Lambada though.\
  \ Noone smokes and a day can't go by without a good megaphone announcement. Especially\
  \ at bus stations. Coffee at all times of the day but tinto! You'll find all the\
  \ good stuff in your local supermarket. Sigh. Holding fresh, red, berry-like coffee\
  \ beans in your hands while standing among banana, plantain and avocado trees. Mind-blowing.\
  \ 60-m-high wax palm trees. Mountains. Everywhere. Willys are jeeps here. Yes. Drinking\
  \ aromaticos while listening to a seemingly never-ending storm. Playing with boutique\
  \ (yes!) hostel resident dogs. Hiking in a Tomb Rider-like landscapes. Crossing\
  \ fast-flowing rivers on makeshift bridges while praying for life. Making it to\
  \ the other end. Best feeling ever until noticing that a local mother with a 2-year\
  \ old in her arms has just completed the same journey... wearing flip-flops. Jaw-dropping\
  \ mountain peaks covered in mist. Loads of mist. Loads of magnificently tangled\
  \ nature. Oversized and magnified-like to us Europeans nature. Nothing is what it\
  \ seems to be. Native bamboo grows next to ever-green trees. You have never seen\
  \ anything like that. A lone Samba dance in an ancient square followed by the most\
  \ delicious hot cup of anise canelazo. Arrival at Colombia's very own Gotham. Greetings\
  \ from 2,625m! 1.5-hr-delay due to the inner city traffic. 40-min long queue to\
  \ collect a taxi ticket. Must register to avoid any risks. Mischievous gato sculptures\
  \ at Museo Botero and the impossible to describe in its ingenious design the 'chanting'\
  \ room at Museo del Oro. Rejuvenating, world-class establishments that make you\
  \ feel a little bit like being back home on a Sunday afternoon. Not for long though.\
  \ Loads of police of any imaginable affiliation outside. Carrying a little bit but\
  \ possibly still too much. Waving down a taxi by tourists is a 'no' so a 7-km-walk\
  \ to the hotel in a safe part of town. Glorious sun. Suntan and slight dehydration\
  \ follows. Of zero concern. Graffiti. Loads of politically-charged graffiti. Volkswagen\
  \ renamed to Colwagen. A true traveller moment when taxi driver decides to drop\
  \ you off by a random roadside saying that it's a better spot to catch a bus to\
  \ Colombia's home of independence. Jaws dropping at the site of mountains encircling\
  \ the 120m x 120m public square coloured in hues of orange courtesy of local sunset.\
  \ The best pizza outside of Italy for supper? Music. Live music filling every inch\
  \ of this vast square. Gentle tapping of hands in rhythm of ridiculously good renditions\
  \ of 'Hotel California'. Fossils. 5hr-trek across dry, unforgiving land to say 'Hi'\
  \ to a 120-million-year-old baby kronosaurus fossil. \xA32-entry ticket each. Glimpsing\
  \ Colombian 'Stonehenge' that helped indigenas plan planting seasons. Pork cooked\
  \ in a 1-m-deep underground wood-burning BBQ. Fancy but overrated. More music at\
  \ night-time. More vinegar against mosquitoes. Balsamic vinegar wins. And why are\
  \ my beloved llamas pronounced with a 'j' sound here?!;) **it Lonely Planet edition.\
  \ Must've forgotten what their calling was back in 1972. And still two weeks to\
  \ go. - Soy de Polonia. - El Papa!\n\n*This seemingly thoughtless formatting is\
  \ full of thought. It is meant to be pose a challenge to anyone trying to 'decipher'\
  \ Colombia. It helps to represent my very own stream of consciousness, depicts thoughts\
  \ and feelings which passed through my mind that January."
