Text: "A Swedish friend had invited me to spend a whole summer in Sweden and, although\
  \ I was happy to travel, my tropical \u201Cme\u201D was struggling really hard for\
  \ being comfortable there. I felt defeated when I couldn\u2019t find black beans,\
  \ guava sweet or Latin music. Luckily, I met an Argentinian woman, living in Bj\xE4\
  rred \u2014the town I was staying\u2014 for 20 years. Besides the possibility of\
  \ talking Spanish, I discovered she was kind of weird: fascinated for multitudes,\
  \ like the fireflies for the light.\nAll my homesickness went away when she told\
  \ me about Sommarfest and the Cuban Salsa Festival.\n\u201CCuban Salsa, you said?\u201D\
  \ I was until that moment, depressed lying in a couch.\n\u201CYes. You\u2019re Cuban,\
  \ aren\u2019t you?\u201D, she said with the typical Argentinian accent. \u201CChe,\
  \ come with me. Let\u2019s dance!\u201D.\nAt the next day, we were in Lund, going\
  \ to the Sommarfest and seeking the place of the Cuban Salsa Festival. The town\
  \ was small and full of ancient buildings and very scanic houses, typical of that\
  \ region and different from the rest of Sweden. \nWe found the Festival in an old\
  \ skating space with graffiti and a lot of Swedish doing picnic while the Dj played\
  \ Cuban music. I recognized them quickly: not only the Dj, but the dance instructors\
  \ were from my homeland.\nAccording to a flyer, the party was arranged by a group\
  \ of Cuban with a Salsa Academy in Malm\xF6, a near city. The music and the heat,\
  \ made me feel like if I was in my Havana. I closed my eyes for a minute and when\
  \ I opened them, I found a beautiful Cuban girl. \n\u201CLook, Pily\u201D I said\
  \ to my friend \u201CIs a Cuban\u201D.\n\u201CGo close, che. Don\u2019t be shy and\
  \ move your hips\u201D.\nI walked slowly to the girl, touched her shoulder and she\
  \ turned to me. \n\u201CHola, \xBFc\xF3mo est\xE1s?\u201D, I asked her.\n\u201C\
  Excuse me?\u201D.\nThe truth punched me. The girl wasn\u2019t Cuban, she was Romanian\
  \ and a Salsa teacher in the Academy. At least I could dance with her, or that\u2019\
  s what I thought, because when the music started she moved with New York style.\
  \ I was traumatized. New York Salsa Style is the one a Cuban would never use. In\
  \ Havana, it was considered ridiculous. More fails in my seeking for Cubanity.\n\
  After a lot of attempts the girl was offended.\n\u201CYou cheated me. You are not\
  \ a Cuban, you can\u2019t even dance Salsa\u201D, she said.\nI was about to cry,\
  \ when Pily waved her hand, a few meters away from me. She was talking to a mixed\
  \ girl, and she looked really Cuban. She was with a Swedish guy, her husband I thought,\
  \ and was holding a baby.\nWhen I was near, she invited me to dance, while the man\
  \ smiled and took the baby. We dance in Havana Salsa Style. I also discovered her\
  \ name was Jessica, she was studying medicine but she decided to find a foreigner\
  \ man to marry and leaving Cuba forever.\n\u201CSweden is beautiful, for God\u2019\
  s sake. But in Winter the dark is the worst thing any Cuban could live. When I arrived\
  \ here the silence almost made me crazy. It drills your ears and you need music,\
  \ any music; mainly the Cuban music\u201D, she told me.\n\u201CWithout friends no\
  \ one is able to survive in the dark\u201D at that moment we were dancing still\
  \ and I was making a complicate move \u201CSome Cubans here, turns more Swedish\
  \ than the born Swedish. I met a lot here and all of them left me alone, but that\
  \ black guy\u201D she was pointing to the Dj.\n\u201CDo you miss Cuba?\u201D I asked.\n\
  She smiled sadly and answered:\n\u201CYou always miss your people. When it\u2019\
  s cold here is when I wanna be there. But I have a daughter now\u201D.\nIn that\
  \ moment, I completely understood Pily\u2019s attitude: why she invited me to Sommarfest\
  \ and why she loved crowded places. Although I was fascinated by Europe, its technology,\
  \ food and landscapes, as long as I stayed at Sweden I would be condemned to collect\
  \ Cuban music in my playlists, looking for black beans in the stores or dancing\
  \ Salsa. But of course, never New York Style."
