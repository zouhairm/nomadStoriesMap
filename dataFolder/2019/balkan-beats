Text: "I planned a month's trip to France confident that a friend would host me for\
  \ the entire duration. Obviously i could'nt afford hotel nights for a month during\
  \ peak tourist season in the south of France. ( Let me pseudonym this expensive\
  \ European peak tourist season phrase with \" Voila\" for future reference)Little\
  \ did I know , my friend would politely refuse and i would carry the burden of a\
  \ non refundable round trip ticket to Paris and a six week vacation at bay.\n  \
  \   Reworking my trip, scouting a cheap flight from Paris , i stumbled upon a 80\u20AC\
  \ one way ticket to Dubrnovik .Voila! The visa requirments fit in just alright though\
  \ not as convinient as travelling in western Europe on a schengen visa stamped on\
  \ an Indian passport. I landed in Paris with 60k INR praying for a pay day miracle\
  \ a week later to sail me through a month . Voila.\n   Croatia is divinely pristine\
  \  . It stands out like the north star in the sky in Europe . The country seems\
  \ installed with automatic anti-garbage and anti-pollutant features. The old town\
  \ DBV is something I've never seen anywhere. An entire city inside a fort to include\
  \ bars, restros , hotels, houses and even Chapels - all by the adriatic shore and\
  \ overlooking a set of scenic islands close enough to swim to.  A game of Thrones\
  \ fan cannot but miss Dubrnovik. . So cannot the young men and women who like to\
  \ party to wee hours in the morning. But Croatia could'nt handle the tourist volume\
  \ this summer coupled with the mileage received at the FIFA barely weeks ago - and\
  \ with no supply to meet demands it does not need an economist to predict what it\
  \ has in store for a backpacker. Voila! It also meant an exit from organised travel\
  \ which the internet facilitates as east as Philippines. It was also the beginning\
  \ of a unexpected discovery of the Balkans.\n     A 15\u20AC ticket and an hour's\
  \ bus ride gets you to the nearest town Kotor in Montenegro- The brand new European\
  \ country as young as 10 yrs in existence. Kotor is a fantastic see since it encloses\
  \ a bay which lies in the line of sight from various stretches of the city. The\
  \ fort built by Venetians overlooking the bay is another marvel. And to top it all\
  \ the cost of travelling drops to half of what Crotia demands. Sans a national currency\
  \ MNE trades in Euros and hostels start as cheap as 6\u20AC and a low budget room\
  \ for 15. The kotor fort is an interesting hour's climb to and on the house if you\
  \ pass the check gates before 7 a.m. The panaromic view from the top of the fort\
  \  of the kotor bay is the best I've seen till date.  Like DBV, Kotor houses a massive\
  \ town inside its fort at the base of the hill. A day tour to Lov\xE7en mountain\
  \ which houses a chapel is a must do om a guided tour for 29\u20AC and can be planned\
  \ with local agents in town. Local transport to Lov\xE7en is hard to find .The beaches\
  \ in Kotor and the nearby Her\xE7eg Novi are crowded in summers given the fact that\
  \ it attracts day tourists from neighbouring Croatia and Bosnia. So the best bet\
  \ to enjoy a peaceful beach time would be to move further south to Budva , Petrova\xE7\
  \ or Bar which was next in my itinerary.\n                             To be continued....."
