Text: "Having traveled extensively worldwide for the last several years in search\
  \ of a quality sustainable lifestyle and community, the one country left to explore\
  \ on my short list is Portugal.  It appears from interviews, travel stories, the\
  \ internet, and other sources to be one of the places left that has a quality of\
  \ community and sustainable rural living that may bode well during a global financial\
  \ reset.  Lacking the vibrant indigenous culture and population of an Ecuador or\
  \ Peru, my present stomping grounds, it does have a certain aire of resilience and\
  \ sustainability I am eager to check out.  \n\nMy plan is to visit this May and\
  \ early June to explore the possibility of living there in a self sustaining rural\
  \ environment and community that shares and supports each other and itself.  It\
  \ seems to have a flair for living and enjoying life that is attractive, but my\
  \ experience is nothing takes the place of personal experience and boots on the\
  \ ground, so off I go to discover the reality of it all. \n\nWhile I love the security\
  \ and stability of the Indigenous Culture in Ecuador, one that has survived and\
  \ even thrived for over 7000 years, I am curious if I can find a place for myself\
  \ in the Portuguese Landscape that will allow me to enjoy life during a time of\
  \ upset and reset, or if that is a pipe dream, and in fact I have already found\
  \ the best place to be during the next decade of change.  \n\nI am excited to venture\
  \ into the unknown, and taste and savor the local culture in Portugal, and see how\
  \ it resonates, and how I am received and hopefully accepted, something I have cherished\
  \ in my last decade of Ecuadorian adventure and residency.  It is the last place\
  \ left to discover on my preferred list of countries that may provide not only safe\
  \ haven, but a place to thrive and enjoy the flow of life."
