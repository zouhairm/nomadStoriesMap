Text: "I did not expect to find diarrhea.\n\nThis story starts in downtown Buenos\
  \ Aires. It was my friend Will\u2019s 27th birthday so we drank a bunch of heavy\
  \ IPAs, ate some incredibly fatty, rich food, and capped the night off with a few\
  \ Jameson shots to celebrate the fact that he is closer to death than ever before.\
  \ \nIn Mendoza, Argentina, the late night food is super poncho hot dogs with mayonnaise.\
  \ We (stupidly) decided that the best time to try one was at 4 AM, from a restaurant\
  \ with a visible litany of health code violations.\n\nI got extra everything on\
  \ my super pancho, including hot sauce, which was a huge mistake, my eyes and mouth\
  \ would not stop leaking fluids. A foreboding sign of things to come.\n\nWe had\
  \ about 3 hours of sleep before we stumbled downtown to meet our tour guide Oscar.\
  \  My morning poop was a watery violent affair, but after a night of drinking, that\u2019\
  s normal so I didn\u2019t give it a second thought. As we started walking towards\
  \ the car, my stomach sounded like it was screaming for help. A feeling of impending\
  \ doom consumed me.\n\nI, unfortunately, had to sit shotgun on the ride there. As\
  \ we started to drive and Oscar tried to converse with me, I had to focus every\
  \ fiber of my being on not shitting all over his passenger seat. I was sweating\
  \ bullets and analyzing the highway, looking for any makeshift bathroom. An emergency\
  \ area, rest stop, even a large bush, anywhere so we could stop and I could spray\
  \ liquid diarrhea all over the place. We were in the Mendoza countryside, there\
  \ was nothing. \n\nWhen we finally arrived, I barely got to take in the beauty of\
  \ Susana Balbo\u2019s house/winery before I annihilated her bathroom. I would do\
  \ this several more times before we left. I don\u2019t think it will ever be the\
  \ same. To Susana and the winery staff \u2013 I\u2019m so sorry, but it was your\
  \ toilet or my pants and I still had a full day ahead of me.\n\nThe Belasco de Baquedano\
  \ winery got the worst of it. The bartenders and staff went from warming greeting\
  \ me to angrily glaring at me after my 6th or 7th trip to their water closet. Since\
  \ there was nobody in the lobby they saw, heard, and smelled the horror I was unleashing\
  \ throughout the day. I learned a long time ago never to trust a fart, so I took\
  \ no chances. \n\nOscar, Will, and Christina had a lot of fun watching me suffer.\
  \ I found it funny on poop #3. By #5 I wanted to go home. By #10-11 I started to\
  \ plan who I was going to call to say goodbye because this is clearly the end of\
  \ my life.\n\nI literally shit myself into tears. I was praying to Allah (God obviously\
  \ wasn\u2019t listening) to make the horror stop. I was sweating, pale white, and\
  \ sobbing. It was a humbling experience. My cheeks were beyond raw from using the\
  \ worst toilet paper on Earth. Good thing we had to walk A LOT for both winery tours.\n\
  \nI also didn\u2019t learn anything about Argentinian wine because I was mostly\
  \ absent during both tours.  When I was present, I struggled to pay attention, what\
  \ little energy I did have was focused on not soiling myself.\n\nDespite my bowel\
  \ issues, it was THE highlight of our Mendoza trip. An unbelievable experience for\
  \ what we paid. I enjoyed the wine tastings and the veal tenderloin I ate at lunch\
  \ was the best steak I have ever had. Sure, the meal was broken up several times\
  \ for my bathroom breaks, but I had learned to take it in stride. No longer was\
  \ I ashamed. I was going to plow ahead and enjoy this day no matter what. \n\nI\
  \ could have complained, let the negativity consume me with shame and regret, but\
  \ I didn\u2019t. This taught me the first and most valuable lesson I learned while\
  \ traveling: just go with it, even when you desperately have to poop. \n\nI overcame\
  \ adversity and didn\u2019t end the day with poop in my pants. In my world, that\u2019\
  s how I measure success.\n\nwww.theoverlyopinionated.com"
