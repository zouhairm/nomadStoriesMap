Text: "Rays of light beamed over the water as the sun arose. It was going to be a\
  \ beautiful day at the beach. \nIt was a long time coming to visit a local beach.\
  \  I like to travel and sometimes traveling to a local destination is just as rewarding.\
  \ \nSitting in the sand feeling the warmth of the sun feels so good. I like to listen\
  \ to everything around me as I sit. The waves make loud crashing sounds and the\
  \ tide moving in and out has such a suction that it can\u2019t be ignored.  Seagulls\
  \ fly over head singing for their morning breakfast.  They can hunt but prefer to\
  \ wait for a Fisherman\u2019s bait to drop.  \nChildren are playing in the sand\
  \ and as they scoop sand with their shovels I hear crunching noises.  These noises\
  \ can be similar to a handful of potato chips being squeezed. \nI sit and listen.\
  \  I see so much around me.  \nFish flip and flop in and out of the water splashing\
  \ as they fall back in.  \nThe fishermen are patiently waiting to catch a big one.\
  \ \nA gray haired man is walking along the coast picking up shells and shark teeth.\
  \ \nKayakers are putting the kayaks in the water.  I can see the excitement in their\
  \ eyes and big smiles filled with laughter.  \nSqueek squeek I hear to the left\
  \ of me. It\u2019s a beach float and a little blonde girl about the age of seven\
  \ is squeezing it.  She obviously can\u2019t wait to float in the water with this.\
  \ \nHer mom is smiling from ear to ear and taking pictures of the little girl. \n\
  Swoosh I hear from behind me.  It\u2019s a frisbee being tossed back and forth between\
  \ two young boys.   Watching the frisbee being thrown tires me out.  \nIt\u2019\
  s a good beach exercise.  \nSpeaking of beach exercise, there\u2019s a beach yoga\
  \ class going on down the beach a few yards away.  I hear the instructor giving\
  \ instructions and to reach to the sky.  \nAs I sit here I get a smile myself. \
  \ I am so thankful to be sitting here right now and to be experiencing a beach in\
  \ my own community.  \nI had no idea that I could have so much fun so close to home.\
  \  I am blessed to have this beautiful beach only twenty minutes from me. \nAs I\
  \ pack up my towel and personal belongings I spot a dolphin flipping around frolicking\
  \ in the water.  This is a wonderful finish to my beach outing.  I will return again."
