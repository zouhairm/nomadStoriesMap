Text: "Hi, I'm Laurent. If we hear about Traveling, some people say \"it's a lot of\
  \ fun\" but some of them say \"so scary\". Well, i can not judge one of them and\
  \ say you are wrong. But, it's a good opinion that represent about people perspective.\
  \ That is beautiful. But, how you can say that is a beautiful? Are you crazy? Well,\
  \ hard to say that i am crazy or not because i feel those thing at first. The scary\
  \ moment and the fun moment in traveling when i start to travel. Travel is not about\
  \ how much money on hostel,motel, flight ticket or our clothes but it's more than\
  \ that. It's all about enjoy the nature, explore the culture, feel the weather,\
  \ learn a new language and the last of course the favourite part. It's all about\
  \ blending with people! \n\nAs we know, human is social creature and we can not\
  \ live with comunicate each other. That is why we make a language as spoken language\
  \ or sign language. Okay, but we have another problem. What is that? Of course,\
  \ about personality and communication. Like me, as introverted person, it's hard\
  \ to talk with new people either shy or scared that people in front of us will do\
  \ a bad things to us. So we decided to keep silent. But, back to previous words\
  \ we are social creature, we are comunicate each other and if we not. We can not\
  \ life. So, what is the tips for introverted person out there? \n\nFirst, we should\
  \ put smile on our face when people look at us. So people around us not scared of\
  \ us. Plus, if you are lucky people that look at us and see us smile at them, they\
  \ will start to approach at us,have a small talk or further like making a friend\n\
  \nSecond and the last,if we travel and we get lost don't be shy to ask. But, we\
  \ should look carefully at the right person. Like this, we can not ask with people\
  \ that walking fast or in rush. If we dare to ask to them. Maybe, they will give\
  \ you slap in your face lol. So, what is the right person for us to ask? Well, we\
  \ should look around and search for a people that is not busy like people that sit\
  \ on the park. But don't approach them like you want to kill no. Big no. But, walk\
  \ slowly , if your eyes and their eyes meet. Put a smile and if they smile at you\
  \ back. It means they can talk to you and they can give you direction. And if they\
  \ show you positive repsonse you can ask about small talk like where they from,\
  \ about their family and if you are super lucky maybe you get offer in their house\
  \ and can save lot of money. But, if we stay at other people we gotta know the attitude\
  \ like helping them clean the house, help them cook foods and many more.\n\nOkay,\
  \ this is my travel story. I hope you guys enjoy my odd story. \nThank you so much\
  \ for your attention \nHope you guys doing well. \nGod bless you"
