Text: "My idea of Cuba came mostly from social media and what little I knew about\
  \ its history. \nHavana on Instagram looked glamorous, retro-chic and I couldn't\
  \ wait to get on that plane!\nI wanted to take my own hashtag-worthy pictures in\
  \ the back seats of classic Cadillac's. I wanted to taste an authentic Cuban cigar\
  \ and sip cocktails made of the finest rum Cuba had to offer, but first I had to\
  \ get my outfits in order (of course).\n\nMonths of planning, ordering, and Pinterest\
  \ boards later, I crafted the perfect wardrobe for my Cuban Bae-cation. A collection\
  \ of lush fabrics, vibrant colors, headwraps, and strappy heels were piled high\
  \ in my brand new hardcover suitcase. I was prepared.\nMy well-traveled boyfriend\
  \ took a different approach packing a carryon with essentials and versatile outfits.\
  \ He shook his head at the sight of my massive suitcase and only offered \u201C\
  I hope you packed flats\u201D. I had. (rolls eyes)\n\nFrom the moment we landed\
  \ I knew Cuba was absolutely nothing that I thought it would be. \nThe airport needed\
  \ some major updates but their \u2018TSA\u2019 workers wore short skirts with lacy\
  \ stockings and red lips so I had hope for the sultry ensembles I packed.\n\nWe\
  \ stayed in Old Habana at a lovely flat on a street called Oficio. It was modern\
  \ and we could access wifi from the rooftop bar. Breakfast from Luis was included\
  \ with our accommodations. Every morning I looked forward to Luis, he didn't speak\
  \ much English, I speak very little Spanish yet we made each other laugh and had\
  \ a genuine connection.\n\nOld Habana was...old, and I mean that in the most beautiful\
  \ way. The preserved architecture was gorgeous and the people wore normal, everyday\
  \ clothes (go figure). Everyone walked with purpose on the narrow cobblestone streets\
  \ with sidewalks that were non-existent. The sound of a horn was a rarity, people\
  \ just knew to get out the way.\n\nEveryone had something to sell, a smile to offer\
  \ and a kind word for us. The homes we saw were very humble but, the spirit of the\
  \ people was abundant. They spoke English and could tell right away that we were\
  \ \u201CAmericano\u201D even with me in neutral basics. Yes, I was grateful I packed\
  \ some normal things or Lucy would have some \u201Csplaining\u201D to do.\n\n\u201C\
  Wifi-parks\u201D are a thing. They were always buzzing, full of locals. The city\
  \ is not technologically advanced. And when you\u2019re there, neither are you.\
  \ \nThe freedom to be unattached to my iPhone was awesome, and something I can never\
  \ do at home.\n\nWalking around one of the parks we met Andrew, a delightful older\
  \ man in a fedora. Playing his guitar and singing, he serenaded us, told us stories\
  \ about his life and shared his amazing energy. I'm not sure how long we chatted,\
  \ but we took dozens of pictures with him. \nI was away, but Andrew felt like home.\
  \ We enjoyed him so much that we tipped him just for his conversation. \nWe spent\
  \ most of our pesos tipping and it was money well spent.\n\nThe food? affordable.\
  \ The drinks? cheap. Both were good but not the highlight. The tour to Vinales was\
  \ magical, with beautiful views from every angle but still not the best part. Simply\
  \ walking the streets in Havana was enough for me.\n The singers who brought me\
  \ to tears, the children playing in the plaza and those nightly adventures that\
  \ ended with lobster or salsa bands were perfections.\n\nI went searching for shallow\
  \ pleasures, photo ops, and rum, but what I discovered was much more. Cuba is a\
  \ country full of proud people striving for a better life. Taking it all in, left\
  \ me with a new perspective on life here in America. \nThe access we have is unparallel\
  \ to places like Cuba and yet they have built their own economy up not by exporting\
  \ but with tourism. There are new hotels in development and more jobs on the way\
  \ for very deserving people. I'm already planning my next visit (with a carryon).\n\
  \nAnd as for my unworn outfits, there's always Miami!"
