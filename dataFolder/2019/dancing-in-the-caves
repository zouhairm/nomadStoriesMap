Text: "Cuba was full of surprises. From its gorgeous beaches in Varadero to historical\
  \ buildings in Havana, this warm country brings visitors all the sensations they\
  \ could be looking for in a fun vacation paradisiac place. But one city was different\
  \ from the touristic places: Trinidad. The city is very poor, but you will feel\
  \ welcome every time villagers try to communicate with you even if you don\u2019\
  t speak Spanish. Food is great and cheap, remember to eat fried shrimps and drink\
  \ canchanchara.\n\nThe city is bucolic, and all the green gives you a feeling of\
  \ connecting with nature. You can walk, dive, swim at waterfalls, ride horses and\
  \ watch birds, but the fun also extents at night time! If you like dancing you will\
  \ love: La Cueva, the nightclub inside a cave. To get in La Cueva (or Disco Ayala),\
  \ the adventure starts before the music. You will need to go up a rocky path in\
  \ the dark to get close to the entrance. Music is typical from the country, lots\
  \ of salsa and reggaeton.\n\nIt\u2019s OK to go alone, Cubans will request to dance\
  \ with you, but I would recommend to go with a group. Most people went there for\
  \ the first time hearing about it only by word of mouth. The club build inside a\
  \ natural cave is about  30 meters underground. The club opens around 11 PM and\
  \ there are five dance floors, three bars and cabaret acts performing until 3 AM.\n\
  \nVisitors would describe as unreal and \"one of a kind\". Dancing in la cueva is\
  \ a \"must do\" in your travel to Trinidad, Cuba."
