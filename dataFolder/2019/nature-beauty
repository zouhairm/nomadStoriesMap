Text: 'The day I open my eyes I saw a beautiful scenario which I cannot forget.I was
  small I may miss the beautiful scenery of the place I was born.Yes I''m talking
  about my birthplace "Gairibas".

  It''s a small village with many beautiful trees,colourful flowers,birds of various
  kind, moderate climates,small amount of population,small routes.The most beautiful
  thing about the place is the morning view.It was 4A.M. I wake up as my 12th boards
  examanination was going I just went out to wash my face that time I saw sun which
  was going to come out from the top hill of "Bhutan".Yeah, from my home in can see
  "Bhutan". That movement I just cannot capture it but I do screenshot in my eyes
  which is still visible whenever I close my eyes.The sun was rising through that
  Hills it seems like somebody is waking up from his long sleep.The land touches it''s
  sun''s first raystep. IT WAS The most amazing sight.

  I forget that I have to prepare for my exam,my mom just screamed at me and I was
  distrub  by my mom.

  After that I went to prepared for my exams.

  Next time It was sunny day I was returning back home from some work my mom has given
  to me and I was walking at road.After  that suddenly it start raining and I was
  like oh no I just started running but suddenly I realised that smell of roads like
  the scenario that rain just removed the dust of roads and it makes road so clean.Not
  only that it just cleared the dust of all locality and makes the village like newly
  bride.That was the second experience I had in Beauty of nature.I''m so lucky to
  be in this village.some people see this things only in television and phones and
  all but I''m just experiencing It Live so I feel very lucky to be in my Home town
  "Gairibas" .

  After that the third experience  I had is I was just going with my friends for a
  walk in evening. We were chilling,dancing,having fun and that very time one of my
  friend just screamed and called us we just run towards her that time what we saw
  was a small bird which was just hatched before 1 week ago in my view that bird was
  just trying to fly for a first time but he was not able to fly.That very time me
  and friends just catch him very smoothly and make her to try her first attempt to
  fly.After that we just help her out and after 3 4 tries she flys and the time she
  fly it was like so amazing moment that nature actually wants her to be in this world
  and increase the beauty of nature.This is the thing I travel and I want to travel
  it my whole life.I love nature and nature too loves me.I just want to experience
  more things about nature.This is my story of traveling to nature beauty'
