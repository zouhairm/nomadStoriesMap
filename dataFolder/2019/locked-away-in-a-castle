Text: "On this cloudless day in Southern Spain there is no escaping the relentless\
  \ sun as I walk through the massive metal doors of the castle. The castle is to\
  \ be my home for the rest of the summer. What have I gotten myself into? Six weeks\
  \ ago spending my summer in Spain seemed like a good idea. A language immersion\
  \ class with a local university seemed like a great way to get my father to buy\
  \ into my desire to travel.\n\tI am beginning to question my choices. This unknown\
  \ and foreign environment is leaving me I\u2019ll at ease. These cold marble steps\
  \ seem to go on forever as I struggle with my over-packed and far too heavy luggage.\
  \ Where am I being led? Why do I feel so alone when there are so many students around?\
  \ Holy shit, I am in Spain alone. I do not know anyone in this program. I do not\
  \ know anyone in this country. I miss home. I miss my parents. I miss my dog. I\
  \ miss the familiar.I don\u2019t even know enough of the language to order a drink\
  \ or to ask directions to the restroom. What was I thinking? Why did I not listen\
  \ to Dad\u2019s warnings? Why did I insist on getting my way?\n\tIn a panic I find\
  \ myself dialing my grandmother. She will know what to do. She will save me from\
  \ my hasty decision. \u201CGrandma, please buy me a ticket home!\u201D That was\
  \ all I remember pleading between sobs. I wonder what time it is in Illinois. Grandma\
  \ sounds, sounds as if I woke her. She did promise to talk to my dad about my concerns.\
  \ At least I think she did.\n\tMy tears and fears still present I find myself in\
  \ my first Spanish class. What was I thinking; I do not know any Spanish. Okay,\
  \ I know enchilada and margarita. Are those really Spanish words? In a fresh panic\
  \ I begin sobbing again. The instructor, Rafa, is squatting next to my chair trying\
  \ to reassure me that everyone gets homesick.\n\tIs it dinner time already? I have\
  \ no appetite. The program director, Hamish, takes notice and invites me to his\
  \ small and cluttered office. I cannot help but notice the bagpipes on his desk.\
  \ Hamish explains his heritage is Scottish and I share that my dad\u2019s heritage\
  \ is Scottish as well. With that bond, Hamish and I are soon talking about our love\
  \ of poetry and writing. Without immediately noticing I find myself much more comfortable.\
  \ My fears are forgotten. The castle is warm and comforting. My fellow students\
  \ soon become my closest friends. My Spain experience is the best experience of\
  \ my life. I want to travel the world!\n\tHowever, I can really live without waking\
  \ to Hamish and his bagpipes as my daily alarm!"
