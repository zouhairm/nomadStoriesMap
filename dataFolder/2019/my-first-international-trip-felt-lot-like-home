Text: "Like most people, I have awaited my first international trip. After waiting\
  \ for 26 years, excited as a kid, I took that first international flight to Sri\
  \ Lanka for the weekend. Once I landed, the 45-minute ride from Bandaranaike International\
  \ Airport late at night was pleasant, but my excitement could not contain my patience\
  \ to reach my place of stay in Aathma Colombo House. And the excitement was worth\
  \ it, each room at the artsy house here is named after Sanskrit words like Tantra,\
  \ Ajna and Kavya. With the view of the lake before you, with all the lush greenery,\
  \ you could immerse yourself in the tranquillity of the place.\n\nAfter spending\
  \ a day in Colombo, I headed to Galle. The name of this place, which is about a\
  \ three-hour ride from Colombo, is believed to be derived from the classical Sinhalese\
  \ term \u2018Galle\u2019, meaning \u2018port near the river Gin\u2019. The well-laid\
  \ roads and expansive highways take you along hills and farmlands, which is a great\
  \ stress-buster. You just feel like putting your headphones on and having some quiet\
  \ \u2018me time\u2019 while taking in the surroundings. On reaching Galle, my sheer\
  \ fondness for the road made me hope that the trip was longer.\n\nWhen you are in\
  \ Galle, you cannot miss out on the surfing options that are available. There are\
  \ many such activities hosted by Airbnb for travellers to learn about local lifestyle\
  \ of people. It was my first try at surfing with \u2018Go Surfing in Galle\u2019\
  . The host, Diluk Oshan, had a tough getting me to fight my fear of water. I\u2019\
  m sure teaching me to surf would have been an adventure for him. As I ended up carrying\
  \ my surfboard and walking on the shore, he shouted out to me saying, \u201CTry\
  \ it, don\u2019t be such a baby\u201D. Nevertheless, I would make an excuse each\
  \ time by saying there\u2019s a big wave approaching, and I would get back in only\
  \ once it recedes.\n\nThough all safety measures were taken care of for beginners\
  \ \u2014 tying one's leg with a leash to the surfboard and not taking us deep into\
  \ the water \u2014 it was quite difficult for me to surf. I was struggling even\
  \ in chest-level water whenever I would try standing on the surfboard. It seemed\
  \ lot easier when I tried it on the shore.        \n\nThe other experience I enjoyed\
  \ was the Galle Fort Walk by Atheeq, which was informative and fun. The host, Atheeq,\
  \ shared how this city in Sri Lanka was the worst affected one due to tsunami in\
  \ 2004. He also talked about how people associate a hill near the Galle Harbour\
  \ with some events of the epic Ramayana. Atheeq then took us through the fort area,\
  \ from where you can spot the remains of Portugese, Dutch and British architectural\
  \ structures.\n\nI was also given an insight into the history of Galle, and learned\
  \ that it was a major seaport, from where spices \u2014 especially cinnamon \u2014\
  \ were exported. The family court in the area still works with old typewriters with\
  \ Sinhalese alphabets on them. The laidback locals, the striking diversity of the\
  \ population, the colonial architecture and the overall serenity of the place make\
  \ you feel like spending your retirement days here.          \n\nAnd like that,\
  \ the tour ended at a gelato ice cream parlour on Peddlers Street \u2014 the perfect\
  \ way to end all that walking under the sun. The food and the locality have a distinct\
  \ similarity to Kerala and Goa. The people here, too, are hospitable, and you might\
  \ have a hard time convincing yourself that you\u2019re actually in another country.\
  \ With very little time left to satisfy the shopaholic in me, I managed to squeeze\
  \ in some retail therapy right before heading to the airport in Colombo.\n\nHeading\
  \ back home from my first international trip, I thought to myself, that I\u2019\
  d definitely want to visit this place again, especially when all I want to do is\
  \ surround myself with nature and kick-back with a cold one."
