Text: "It's about me and my man for a secret rendezvouse. Both persons at the very\
  \ different time zone, little did she know about him or what kind of adventures\
  \ would lead. Those hours become days and days become month without him, but here\
  \ she was, on the path, watching the bats flit through the trees. Until one day,\
  \ we both decided to meet for the first time and no one knows. Finally here i am,\
  \ Switzerland the most beautiful country I've ever seen with every mountain range\
  \ covered by those snows, those flowers and also foods. First day, I visited bern\
  \ which was very good city. We traveled by train, in bern trains very flexibility\
  \ while many long-hauls require reservations, many short trips don\u2019t, so you\
  \ can simply show up at the station the day of your trip and grab a ticket for the\
  \ next train \u2014 without paying an exorbitant last-minute fare. And foods, my\
  \ man told me the often that he eat are bread, he takes me to buy croissant, well\
  \ I'm asian so for me the important food is rice but trust me croissant so yummy.\
  \ So another food is kebab, this one is his favorites and i tasted it too. After\
  \ all the foods he takes me to altenbergsteg bridge, it was so cool with blue water\
  \ and i'm just walking around and sing. But switzerland can be very cold at the\
  \ winter, i can even feel my body but I'm glad my boyfriend gave me extra sweater.\n\
  Another day, we are going to zytglogge its a clock tower with very good architecture\
  \ its almost same with kota tua in jakarta but i think switzerland better. Take\
  \ a look in the inside so many chairs and there's Maschine too. Not much i explored\
  \ bern because that is so cold and i can't handle it. So even I'm sick, I'm so happy\
  \ to know bern also met my boyfriend who guide me and taking care of me. Switzerland\
  \ so wonderful even the snow made sick but believe me it just make the view of the\
  \ city look so beautiful. This little rendezvouse are just amazing, I'm not sure\
  \ can forget it. Such a lovely day i had."
