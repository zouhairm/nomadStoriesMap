Text: Traveling goes beyond ego, goes beyond photos and luxury, traveling is awakening
  awareness is to see how much the world is evolved is to realize that we are able
  to exert change in the life of another anywhere. That's why I like the unknown,
  to venture out and in this way I was wishing the taste of knowing the new, the desire
  to travel appeared I had some savings and in less than an hour I was already at
  the bus station buying tickets and reserving a room in hostel by Airbnb on mobile.
  I got home and still not understand what I did, I waited for the plug to fall yet
  I just went. BETTER EXPERIENCE OF MY LIFE, in fact the best things happen suddenly,
  arrived on the day of the trip I got the bus dawn I arrived in Fortaleza from the
  entrance to the hostel and went out to explore the city, meet people, see the routine
  of the city enter the flow of the place , a real immersion that transformed me every
  day, the bars, the incredible cafes and restaurants, the street foods and places
  left me in love with destiny, I could only see the immensity of the universe that
  the trip gave me, the peculiar smell of the night to the strolling along the shore
  led me to be captivated, a place, a desire. On the way back I understand how invigorating
  the destinations we know, how much to get lost in the middle of the city gives a
  cold in the belly but makes you feel alive. A taste for the unknown is the best
  experience. The basis in my dream of traveling the world is purposes, and this is
  one of the meanings of travel in my conception PURPOSE, I hope to be able to fulfill
  my desires and aspirations by modifying my being, to sit in the window of airplanes
  knowing that the world is on my side and I'm on his side, meeting him, traveling.
