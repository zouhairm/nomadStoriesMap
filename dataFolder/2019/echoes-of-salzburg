Text: "Echoes of Salzburg\n\n\_ \_ \_Seven hundred- how do you put a number to an\
  \ experience burnt in your memories forever? Sixteen- years ago when everything\
  \ around you blurred, the day I laid eyes on you. Twenty Fifteen- summer, there\
  \ you are flustered and propped on our luggage. Smiling nonetheless, leaping into\
  \ another unventured domain- with me. Train station: Salzburg, Austria.\n\n\_ \_\
  \ \_The night train trips we took across Europe had been our way of staving off\
  \ on hotel fees. We time our day arrivals, deposit our things in the rental station\
  \ lockers and hit the ground running. Back by night time at the station and then\
  \ we're off to our next destination. But Salzburg was different, we chose to moor\
  \ there. Old world and compact: it's Europe in a single bite \u2013 akin to that\
  \ bitter sweet chocolate Tacher cake we ate and downed with the local Stiegl lager.\n\
  \n     We missed a bus stop on our way to our hotel. Locals gave us directions in\
  \ English and we found the quaint property at the foothills of the Austrian Alps.\
  \ The pristine sun bathed the backdrop forest and - you sitting by the picture window\
  \ gazing outside. How still the moment was. As if on cue the mountain breeze broke\
  \ the daze and we set to start our day's adventure. In the bus, I remembered us\
  \ smiling at the curious little kid who kept side glancing at us. He was Asian like\
  \ us. The multinational vibe of the local commuters was very palpable. At the centre\
  \ plaza we booked the next day's early morning Salt Mine tour and off we go running\
  \ to make it to the ever-popular Fraulein Maria\u2019s bicycle tour. We went through\
  \ the sites and scenes of the classic movie \u201CThe Sound of Music.\u201D In and\
  \ around this walled city we pedalled vintage cycles ala von Trapp family. From\
  \ the gazebo to the gardens, atop the Hohensalzburg fortress and to the Abbey gates\
  \ we went. Off we breezed thru the side of the River Salzach, and crossed bridges\
  \ connecting the \u201COld Town\u201D Altstadt to the \u201CNew Town\u201D Neudstadt.\
  \ Dust clouds billowed behind us as we cruised the gravel road outside the iron-gated\
  \ Frohnburg Palace. And did we hear such spritely compositions emanate from the\
  \ 'yellow house' of the great W.A. Mozart? We then beheld the view across the lake\
  \ for the Rococo architecture of the Leopoldskron Palace. I earned my badge of honour\
  \ in hues of black and blue on my legs and thighs from the 3.5 hr long, hit and\
  \ miss bicycling.\n\n\_ \_ \_Sweltering, it was a particularly hot European summer\
  \ as the heat waves struck. In lieu of misting stations Salzburg has pure Artesian\
  \ water, free flowing from ancient drinking fountains abound the city. After midday\
  \ we took respite in a leisurely walk by the gardens. It was Paul\u2019s turn to\
  \ pedal his trike, a local university student part-time tour guide. A quick thumbs\
  \ up from Paul in our group selfie and off we go deeper in the city centre. We persistently\
  \ peruse for local street fares: a must on any of our trips. A pickled herring and\
  \ baby octopus was in order, our palates seabound while in the Alps. I can still\
  \ feel and taste the briny crunch of the sea asparagus it was served with. A pop\
  \ of lemon fizz soda at the refreshment stall across capped off this unforgettable\
  \ meal. Some weave stories of an ill-fated romance of Stephan Balkenhol\u2019s two\
  \ sculptures on permanent exhibit: \"Sphaera\" (the Man a top the Golden Globe)\
  \ and the \u201CWoman in the Rock.\u201D Their story echoes in the distance.\n\n\
  \_ \_ \_We have always leapt into the unknown: the surprise beauty that was Salzburg,\
  \ how our story started and how it ended. That was our last trip together. I looked\
  \ at the empty porcelain trinket box I secretly bought that afternoon at Salzburg's\
  \ Alter Markt. It was to hold a ring I was thinking of getting you one day. That\
  \ day never came for us. \"We will always have Salzburg,\u201D a whisper as I closed\
  \ the trinket box.\n\n     Nineteen-words short and I rest my pen."
