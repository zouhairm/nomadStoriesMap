Text: "After five hours of painting houses we got lost. Lina was really sure she knew\
  \ the way back to the tram station that brought us to the top of the favela Santa\
  \ Marta but, instead, we were immerse into the countless sidewalks that surround\
  \ the most colorful neighborhood in Rio de Janeiro. Now thinking,  staying for a\
  \ traditional on the top of the mountain would have been a good idea.\n\nGlobally\
  \ known as really dangerous, favelas hold the most of the population of the most\
  \ populated country in South America. For me and my friend Lina, Colombians, precaution\
  \ is something you live with everyday, so there was no doubt when we got the invitation\
  \ tow days before to a volunteer job painting houses in one of those mysterious\
  \ places, almost forbidden for \"gringos\", people from outside Brazil.\n\nAt the\
  \ meeting point, a park based on the bottom to the mountain, we identified a crowd\
  \ of disoriented people waiting for someone to take the lead into the activity,\
  \ and we were about to join them. Guided by staff of the promoter company we started\
  \ our way into the favela. Being seen by everyone around as the piece from a completely\
  \ different puzzle was something I am really sure all of us felt. After a 15 minute\
  \ walk through the main street we got into a house where we were provided with t-shirts,\
  \ glasses, gloves, brushes and paint tins. Tram up, another walk and we arrived\
  \ to a plaza with a Michael Jackson statue and mosaic. Surrounded by gift shops\
  \ filled with Jackson's souvenirs the local tour guide described how a few minutes\
  \ from a music video changed the prospect of the neighborhood and how 23 years later\
  \ people still feel connected with the iconic late king of pop. \n\nNow after all\
  \ that talking, we finally arrived into the purpose of this writing, painting with\
  \ colors the houses of people . You could say we were there to bring life back to\
  \ the people in need by improving with some colors the fronts or their houses but,\
  \ the fullness, the tranquility and the detachment from the material they put across\
  \ through their eyes said everything. The owners chose the color but they gave us\
  \ freedom to lay out our imagination.\n\nA schedule trip impeded us to stay longer,\
  \ the group did but me and Lina had to leave. Two minutes walking and we were already\
  \ lost. It was curious to realize how could you have one foot on the sidewalk and\
  \ the other on the roof of some house. Starting to worry we run into a woman who\
  \ looked as she just came back from work, carrying a bag with the groceries she\
  \ needed for the day, who helped us to find our way back to the station. Even when\
  \ the neighborhood seemed safe and friendly and we experienced no danger at all,\
  \ you will always fear to the unknown. Full of paint spots all over the body we\
  \ headed to our place in Zona Sul happy, but expecting to, at some point of our\
  \ lives, reach the harmony with which these people live, despite the problems in\
  \ which they are submerged."
