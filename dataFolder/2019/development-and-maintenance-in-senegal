Text: "Village of Belly-Thiowy about 750 km from the capital of Senegal, the modern\
  \ Dakar. I am there with Silvano, a Swiss big man president of the NGO that I follow\
  \ to document the modernization of the province of Matam. It is my first time in\
  \ Africa and my journey is intimidated only by the news that some days ago armed\
  \ Islamic extremists have been sighted in the village. I repeat: \"Emilio do not\
  \ give in to ignorance, you are here to discover a culture. So think about what\
  \ the people of your land say, Sicily; is it true? !!! \".\n\nAbandoned the main\
  \ road, we cross a dirt road: on the right fields, on the left the Senegal river\
  \ and just beyond the red earth of Mauritania. In front of us: boys on the scooter\
  \ and then men on horsebackL; they escort us into the village with songs and dances.\
  \ What remains imprinted on me? Smiles.\n\nGoing to the construction site, I learn\
  \ to know the workers better and inevitably their families. The Diallo, the Diow\
  \ and the Sow are around three families in the village. Lunch for me is one of the\
  \ most beautiful moments, of union and even if I belong to a distant culture, it\
  \ brings me closer; it will be that due to the divorce of my family and my removal\
  \ from home as a teenager I'm not used to a certain kind of atmosphere. But I throw\
  \ away the sad thoughts and I too dip my hands in the rice to taste its flavor,\
  \ today it is vegetables!\n\nIt seems that the construction site are proceeding\
  \ well and then I begin to visit the past works, it is an excuse to visit other\
  \ nearby villages. \nBut I realize that something is wrong: the infrastructure is\
  \ in ruins. Abandoned fields, non-functioning aqueducts and school rooms not in\
  \ use. \n\nWhy?\n\nThrough the province to find an answer, from Diomel to Garl\xEC\
  \ the situation is identical.\nThe people I meet say they do not have the economic\
  \ resources to keep some works, others ask for infrastructures to make the previous\
  \ ones work. Meanwhile, American rice and European mandarins are sold in the markets.\
  \ It makes no sense, I found that working the fields already built the population\
  \ could be self-isufficient. In many villages they grow rice, onions and bananas.\n\
  \nSilvano and I were stranded with the car in Tiengpeng, the times to fix it are\
  \ so long and I decide to walk around. Not far from the mechanic I see a party.\
  \ It is a party for the inauguration of a cheese factory, with ministers who rejoice\
  \ for their skills in having found the necessary funds ... a cheese factory ...\
  \ with 50 degrees celsius!\n\nI'm dejected, and in a few days I have to leave. I\
  \ decide to attend a last village meeting. This is a meeting of young people: they\
  \ talk about development.\nIn the middle of the chorus of voices asking for other\
  \ infrastructure, one stands out above all and captures my interest so I catch hardly\
  \ my Pular translator and not leave him! \n\nIt is the voice of Faty that calls\
  \ young people to take care of the maintenance of the infrastructure, because now\
  \ it is the real development for the village; we must no longer ask, but keep what\
  \ we have.\n\nMore calm with a message that comes from that small village, but could\
  \ be universal."
