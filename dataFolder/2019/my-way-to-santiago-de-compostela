Text: "Day 30 (October 30th, 2018) \n\nIn company of: We were officially a group of\
  \ 9 pilgrims. All of us from different countries, ages, languages and different\
  \ reasons to walk \"El camino\". We all met at different stages of our hiking, then\
  \ we missed each other and before getting to Santiago we met again. We kept as a\
  \ group during the last 2 days before we reached Santiago. - During the walk we\
  \ often said that with our languages and knowledge we could fix the world-\n\nWeather\
  \ conditions: Fresh in the morning, warm, hot, super-hot, the hell!!!\n\nDeparture\
  \ time: 8:00 A.M. \n\nKilometers walked: 20.8\n\nInjuries: Some bruses on my legs.\n\
  \nCondition of the pilgrim: Alive, reflexive and grateful.\n\nDiscoveries of the\
  \ pilgrim: I will never get used to say good bye but every time I do it with more\
  \ gratitude.  \n\nFunny things on the Camino: Plastic zipper bags when you hike\
  \ for weeks are precious.  \n\nMy feelings were contrasting\u2026. A mixed between\
  \ happiness and incredulity. I asked to myself: \u201CDid you really walk 800 kilometers?\u201D\
  \ Are you really here? Then I pinched my hand and\u2026Yeah! I was there!!!\n\n\
  It\u2019s amazing how a human body can adapt to any condition. My body in about\
  \ 10 days knew we were walking for a while and in consequence I learnt many more\
  \ things:  how to get packed my stuff in 10 minutes and be ready for the hiking\
  \ day in no more than 20 including having a light breakfast and brushing my teeth.\
  \ My body, my brain and my soul knew what to do: WALK! \uF04A\n\nThe sensation of\
  \ reaching Santiago is one of the most interesting and memorable sensations I have\
  \ ever had. We were walking as a group feeling proud of ourselves, each one in a\
  \ different way, the weight of our backpacks was completely irrelevant , we smiled\
  \ to people that were looking at us. In my mind the Cathedral would be in my right\
  \ hand side but actually it is on my left hand side. The building is impressive\
  \ and huge!\n\nCompostela: A kind of diploma that every pilgrim get once they had\
  \ finished the pilgrimage. After I got it I surprisingly also got a ticket for a\
  \ complimentary lunch in one of the oldest hotels in the world: \u201CParador de\
  \ Santiago\u201D . It was a hospital for pilgrims in the past and it was built in\
  \ 1499. The hotel offers 10 free meals for pilgrims every day and I got one! \n\n\
  Thought of the day: There are some moments in life where you don\u2019t know what\
  \ to do, it is a mix of excitement, madness and freedom, wanting to hug everyone\
  \ and cry. I\u2019m sure I wasn\u2019t the only one I felt that\u2026 the others\
  \ just look at me and smiled.\n\n\u201CO Cami\xF1o empeza agora\u201D\n\u201CThe\
  \ way starts now\u201D\nP.S. Compostela means \u201CField of Stars\u201D"
