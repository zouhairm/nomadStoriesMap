Text: "\u201CThrough there is the fowl house,\u201D she said. Everyone had told me\
  \ my husband\u2019s grandmother was lucid and I was starting to see why. She pointed\
  \ to a shaded path as I questioned whether I should crouch down and follow my husband\
  \ under the stubby, intermingled trees, but I had to. He led me through and there\
  \ it was, understated surrounded by more fallen branches.\n\nIt was all rust and\
  \ rubble. Traces of a past life were scattered around: outlines of flower beds along\
  \ the fenceline, an old puppy pen that was no longer used, and old four-wheelers\
  \ crushed by the old shed walls that have caved in since their prime. In the back,\
  \ remnants of an orchard with overgrown everything, grapes, peaches, nectarines,\
  \ and feijoas. Cats and dogs ran amuck and there was no peace by the house.\n\n\
  She led us through, giving me a tour and letting Andrew reminisce. This was her\
  \ home and where he spent most of his childhood. She clutched my arm and guided\
  \ me through, pointing to where things used to be, like the boat, and the horses,\
  \ and 1950s Jag they had. A diesel tank sat on the side, covered in dirt and rust.\
  \ She pointed to it and Andrew told me how one day after coming home from church\
  \ they found a couple of their dogs shot dead and the diesel tank drained. \u201C\
  Greed,\u201D he said, and turned away.\n\nShe stopped and signaled for us to go\
  \ on, she would wait. I moved forward with Andrew, he led me past the fallen shed\
  \ walls, said it used to house his granddad\u2019s boats. Now the cows get in and\
  \ trample everything. We slithered past an old, wrecked car - his granddad\u2019\
  s, until it was crushed. Old glass soda pop bottles piled up on the left side of\
  \ the path, on the right an overturned metal bathtub, and further down another wrecked\
  \ fence. It led out to a patio, probably more than an acre, covered in grass, thriving\
  \ in the shade. \n\n\u201CThis is it,\u201D he said. \u201CThis is the end of the\
  \ farm\u2019s estate.\u201D Behind us led up to the main farm and in front of us\
  \ a breathtaking view of the ocean. It was calm, and it was clear. He stood, shy,\
  \ embarrassed by the rubble, the mess that had been made of his once-spotless childhood\
  \ home because of greed and disease. But then, I didn\u2019t see the rust the same\
  \ way anymore.\n\nIt was beautiful. All of it. Every little piece that we passed\
  \ had a story, history, that contributed to its beauty, to my husband\u2019s beauty.\
  \ My eyes were opened to the history surrounding me in Mahia as we travelled over\
  \ hills and around bends, along the coastline and through farmlands with the people\
  \ who lived there. I never thought I would find such richness and life underneath\
  \ the rubble but it was there, and all I had to do was look."
