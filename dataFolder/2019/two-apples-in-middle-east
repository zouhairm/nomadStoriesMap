Text: "My first trip to another country came due to unpleasant circumstances. My uncle\
  \ who lived in Sharjah, UAE fell terribly sick one day and someone had to be there\
  \ real quick - and that happened to be me. Quick visa processing, irresponsible\
  \ packing and a few clicks later, I was at the airport filled with excitement and\
  \ worry. \n\nOf course the flight was late - holding a grudge against Air India\
  \ is a national aviator's pass time. Nonetheless, I was in UAE by 03:00 AM, more\
  \ worries than before. My SIM card showed no network and for a moment I couldn't\
  \ find my passport. The latter resurfaced as if by magic though the network was\
  \ nowhere to be found. I got myself a SIM card by Etisalat (or 'yeti salad' as I\
  \ like to call it) and stood at the arrivals, taking a few seconds to soak in the\
  \ essence of another country I did not know as much as I thought I should have.\n\
  \nMy uncle's friend received me and we were off - the cab ride was mesmerizing,\
  \ with the desert and palm trees completing the nighttime aesthetics. He handed\
  \ me the keys to my uncle's apartment and said he'd visit me at 9 in the morning.\
  \ I slept on the sofa; not the right amount of sleep I wanted but the cushioning\
  \ welcomed me in most loving manner. \n\nAs it is in India, so it was in India.\
  \ My uncle's friend arrived at 10, an hour late - I couldn't complain because he\
  \ was to take me to the hospital and show me around. Another cab ride made it evident\
  \ that driving here is much more pleasant than my homeland. The speeds, the turns\
  \ and the cleans roads - all that made my heart race.\n\nThe situation at the hospital\
  \ didn't provide the same feeling. My uncle was ill and they would need to keep\
  \ him under supervision for a month. That was my trip - a long journey to see someone\
  \ close just to see them not speak a word - age and corruption is a taxing concept.\n\
  \nWhat happened after his friend dropped me a few hundred metres away from the apartment\
  \ was what I treasure. While I walked in dejection, a man in his forties or fifties\
  \ extended his hand, with a green apple, that was tiny but looked rich in taste.\
  \ \"I don't want to buy, I'm sorry,\" I said. \"I wouldn't sell to someone this\
  \ upset, but I give these as goodwill.\" He caught me off guard but I was soon interested.\
  \ He had a crate full of apples in his car and soon enough, he was happy to hand\
  \ me another - \"If one does not make you happy, two should. These are fruits, so\
  \ don't feel that you'll look greedy. Have.\"\n\nThough I did think that there could\
  \ be something wrong, the warmth that emanated from him made me take both. We both\
  \ leaned against the wall and started talking. \"You can call me Omar. I may be\
  \ old but I am a good friend, I believe.\" He chuckled, the obvious intention being\
  \ to make me smile; or laugh.\n\nWe talked about our countries, culture, roads,\
  \ cars, history and everything we could in that 15 minute conversation. There was\
  \ a genuine exchange of knowledge from two sets of perspectives in a huge age gap.\
  \ I was 21. Once it was over, I felt better about everything. \"Thank you for this,\
  \ it was sweet of you,\" I said as I went to shake his hands. \"No hugs?\" That's\
  \ what he asked as he extended his hands for a hug and I was more than happy to\
  \ comply. Omar may seem clingy to some but he saw the isolation, sadness and loathing\
  \ of a young man in a foreign land."
