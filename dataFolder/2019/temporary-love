Text: "\u201CBuenas tardes se\xF1or por favor gong Atahualpa.\u201D My friend had\
  \ come to visit me and I was doing my best to express my perfected Spanish. The\
  \ taxi driver pulled up to the salsa club and I handed him $1.50. \u201CGracias,\u201D\
  \ I said...remembering to roll my R.  The club was similar to a rich person\u2019\
  s home. Beautiful flowers outside to welcome us and a resting area. We moved in\
  \ quickly and found a table. Two Americans looking around doubting ourselves every\
  \ time we saw the two step harmony and shuffle of the well-organized salsa dance.\
  \ Everyone was in pairs and dancing seemed to come natural to them, like it was\
  \ their first language. I whispered to my friend, \u201CLet\u2019s try it.\u201D\
  \ My head wrap was so big I made sure to add, \u201CDon\u2019t try to spin me, God\
  \ forbid this nappy hair is exposed and scare away the Ecuadorians.\u201D We tried\
  \ it and failed, tried again and failed. We kept stepping on each other\u2019s toes,\
  \ we forgot to appoint someone as the leader, and we kept missing beats. We laughed\
  \ and accepted defeat. We rushed back to our table and decided it was better if\
  \ we watched. Soon after our sweaty for nothing attempt, a man walked over dressed\
  \ in black pants, black shoes, and a black semi leather jacket with his long black\
  \ curly hair falling on his shoulders. \u201CQuieres bailar?\u201D He took my hand.\
  \ I replied instantly, \u201CNo hablo Espa\xF1ol.\u201D\n\nHe changed his language\
  \ as quickly as I denied his request to dance, \u201COh I speak English,\u201D he\
  \ said. \u201CDo you want to dance?\u201D I heated up internally and became immediately\
  \ impressed. He walked me to the dance floor and said, \u201CThe man is the leader\
  \ OK?\u201D I shook my head yes. Surely whatever he said I would do. \u201COK follow\
  \ I,\u201D he demanded with his broken English. The songs guided him as he guided\
  \ me, and the more we danced the more I played with the thought of love. The last\
  \ dance was much slower, he lowered his hand to the small of my back and guided\
  \ me. He whispered in my ear you are a good dancer. I heard I love you. I smiled\
  \ and realized I had forgotten about my friend. I said thank you for the dance and\
  \ proceeded to go my way. \u201CDo you have WhatsApp?\u201D The long-haired bilingual\
  \ dancer asked so I gave him my number and from that night for four months it was\
  \ the love from book stories. \n\nThe man and I found an apartment, found work,\
  \ and found the laughter in each other. The tradition of eating together and watching\
  \ movies on a laptop small enough to fit in the palm of the hand became our time.\
  \ The loud lovemaking- which made the American Mormon neighbors extremely weary\
  \ of us. The walking to bus stops and hanging clothes outside to dry, the arguments\
  \ about money, the job losses, the morning smoothies from fresh produce, and the\
  \ long conversations about religion, kept me in a foreign country considering a\
  \ lifelong love. \nMy friends in the U.S were graduating, buying homes, getting\
  \ married, and they seemed so happy. I watched from afar thinking capitalistic thoughts-\
  \ more. I wanted more. Love was nice, but a Master\u2019s degree, salaried job,\
  \ and a car sounded better. My reality was becoming miserable. The bilingual\u2019\
  d man with the long hair, with the love I had never experienced wasn\u2019t good\
  \ enough anymore. Capitalism, once it is learned, seeps within the being and the\
  \ only freedom one could imagine is the accumulation of more. More money, more goals,\
  \ more houses, more money, more lovers, more degrees, more traveling, more furniture.\
  \ The more ruined us. \n\nIt is the nagging spirit of comparison and the burdensome\
  \ emotions of what success looks like.\n \nMy lover held back on attempting to convince\
  \ me. He knew. The morning of Valentine\u2019s Day, the man woke me up with soft\
  \ kisses on my forehead and at the root of neck. He opened his phone with a one\
  \ way ticket back to the U.S. I cried, we cried and he led me to the kitchen. I\
  \ knew, he knew, we knew this would be our last meal."
