Text: "2 and a half weeks in paradise after a 19 year wait. \n\nIt was June 16th 2018\
  \ the biggest & most emotional day in history for me and my sister Kayla. The day\
  \ we finally got to go St.Kitts in the Caribbean. Why so emotional you wonder? Well..\
  \ that\u2019s where the 19 year wait comes in. Being born in the tropics but growing\
  \ up abroad from a newborn was difficult. \n\nAfter 19 years of living in England\
  \ we finally got our residence permit which meant we could do what we\u2019ve always\
  \ wanted to do for years, travel. Of course the 1st place we went to just HAD to\
  \ be our birth country!\n\nBut it didn\u2019t stop there. During the duration of\
  \ our holiday not only did we go to St.Kitts, we also done a little 5 day island\
  \ hop visiting the islands of Trinidad and St.Maarten, because why not right ?!\
  \ We deserve it! \n\nAfter the long dreaded 10 hour flight to St.Kitts the plane\
  \ finally landed. The Caribbean is known for its all year round sunshine and hot\
  \ temperatures, of course they have their storms now and again but as soon as we\
  \ arrived it started to pour it down with rain and everyone had to wait on the plane\
  \ until it subsided.  NOW...call me dramatic but I said to my sister; \u201C Do\
  \ you know what this means? It\u2019s the island crying because she knows we\u2019\
  ve returned home. She can feel us here.\u201D It\u2019s safe to say my sister &\
  \ I have a magical presence. \n\nFinally after 10 minutes the rain stopped. As we\
  \ stepped off the plane and our feet touched the ground the sun came out again,\
  \ I felt that 32 degrees Celsius heat and sun-rays beaming on my skin like I was\
  \ reborn. I was home, WE was home and it felt incredible. \n\nWe was only in St.Kitts\
  \ for a day before heading to Trinidad on the 20th to attend a Breakfast Cooler\
  \ Fete, \u201CFete\u201D (pronounced \u2018fet\u2019) in the Caribbean simply means\
  \ party. The vibes were out of this world, although with it being on a boat and\
  \ being scarred for life after watching titanic, I felt like I was going to die.\
  \ \n\nThat evening I went to the nearby cinema to meet with my friend Chyanne who\
  \ is like a little sister to me, it was our 1st time meeting after speaking  online\
  \ for 4 years. The trip had got better and better!\n\n2 days passed and it was June\
  \ 20th, time to head to St.Maarten. At this point me and Kayla were overwhelmed\
  \ by our experience so far and we were only 5 days in our holiday overall. But the\
  \ party never stops for island girls. During our stay in St.Maarten we went our\
  \ separate ways to spend time with our other sisters we had on the island, the time\
  \ for family & creating bonds. My older sister Kimmy drove me around both St.Maarten(Dutch\
  \ Side) & St.Martin(French Side). It honestly felt like heaven on earth, the exotic\
  \ views were breathtaking. \n\nOur little island hop was over, it was time to return\
  \ home to St.Kitts once again to finish the rest of our holiday.  Coincidentally\
  \ after landing guess what happened? Yes, it rained. She cried those tears of joy\
  \ for her girls landing again, my sister & I felt like royalty, like two Queens.\
  \ \n\nAfter returning we only had 11 days left but I can assure you those 11 days\
  \ were well spent. Like the annual St.Kitts Music Festival and White Sands which\
  \ has local and international artists perform over 5 days, shopping till we drop\
  \ & eating until we could barely walk. \n\nThe 11 days did indeed fly by and as\
  \ soon as you knew it, it was time to head back to England. The 10 hour journey\
  \ back was full of tears. 19 years away from a island so beautiful and so sweet,\
  \ the island where we were brought into the world and look, time couldn\u2019t wait\
  \ for us. \n\nWe laughed, we cried, we smiled and almost died, we argued and we\
  \ fete but this was a holiday we would never forget. Our 2 and a half weeks in paradise."
