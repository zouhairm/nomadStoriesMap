Text: "When I booked my trip to Myanmar last September, not many people were supportive\
  \ of my choice. \n\nMany of my relatives and friends said they would rather go somewhere\
  \ else and urged me to reconsider my travel plans reminding me of the fragile stability\
  \ in the country marred by the recent reports about violence against Rohingya, a\
  \ Muslim minority that populates the coastal Rakhine State.\n\nI understand that\
  \ politics and media play a great role in people's perception of certain places,\
  \ however, I wasn't going to let the political situation in the country determine\
  \ my travel choice. I'm a firm believer that underneath stereotypes, every place\
  \ has something special that an average tourist may not learn about from the glossy\
  \ brochures and travel guides. And I was eager to prove everyone wrong and tell\
  \ them that Myanmar is a truly unique country.\n\nI spent a few weeks conducting\
  \ my research on Myanmar. A new travel darling that has emerged as one of the most\
  \ enigmatic Southeast Asian destinations after the decades of the military rule\
  \ seemed appealing to me because it was off limits to tourists for so long. I was\
  \ thirsty for something new and undiscovered and Myanmar seemed like the perfect\
  \ place. \n\nAfter spending a few days in Hong Kong, I arrived in Yangon, the largest\
  \ city in Myanmar. Walking on the streets of this Southeast Asian city and visiting\
  \ Sule Pagoda at night was an unforgettable experience. It was surreal to be in\
  \ a developing country for the first time in my life and see how little people there\
  \ have compared to Western nations. \n\nBut despite multiple warnings from my friends\
  \ and family, I never felt unsafe. I never had anybody try to mug or attack me.\
  \ It was the opposite. People were smiling at me, asking to take pictures and trying\
  \ to help with directions and food orders even when their English was limited. \n\
  \nWhen I traveled to Inle Lake, a gorgeous freshwater reservoir surrounded by the\
  \ mountains of Shan State, I discovered rural Myanmar. I spent three days visiting\
  \ small villages situated around the lake and learning about how local people make\
  \ silverware, textiles, and paper from scratch. As I interacted with locals, I learned\
  \ that people in rural parts of the country truly cherish the contact with foreigners\
  \ because they have so little of it. \n\nWhile people at Inle Lake heavily rely\
  \ on tourism and agriculture for their livelihood and do need tourists' money to\
  \ survive, I've always felt that they genuinely wanted to interact with me and didn't\
  \ see me just as a walking dollar sign. I was appreciative of their curiosity because\
  \ after traveling in the developing countries for most of my life, I wasn't used\
  \ to it. \n\nWhile I couldn't drink the tap water and didn't always have the comforts\
  \ of the Western world that I'm used to, I enjoyed climbing pagodas in Bagan,  walking\
  \ up the hill barefoot in Mandalay and hearing the monkeys rumbling on the trees\
  \ above me. And it was exactly that feeling that made my memories about this trip\
  \ so special. The feeling of venturing into the unknown has left me longing for\
  \ more undiscovered spots. \n\n All these experiences made me feel like I was discovering\
  \ a new destination unfamiliar to most travelers, so I came back home feeling that\
  \ I've substantially grown on my travels. I recommend Myanmar to every aspiring\
  \ and experienced traveler because as the interest in this country grows, it's going\
  \ to continue changing. And as more tourists arrive, it will never be the same.\n\
  \nThe truth is, as the poorest country in Southeast Asia Myanmar has a fair share\
  \ of issues. But the ordinary people and the culture of the country should never\
  \ be viewed through the prism of politics. The Burmese people do their best to get\
  \ by and their kindness was truly amazing and overwhelming for someone who has never\
  \ been to this part of the world before. Despite all its problems, Myanmar remains\
  \ an amazing country that has taught me so much about appreciation, friendship,\
  \ and compassion, and I firmly believe that it should be on every traveler's bucket\
  \ list."
