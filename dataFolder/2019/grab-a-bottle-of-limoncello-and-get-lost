Text: "Wake up in the morning and surround yourself in the middle of cobble concrete\
  \ jungle, endless blue canals, smell of coffee, sun-kissed buildings, masks galore,\
  \ music and you're in San Giacomo. Now imagine two women, one mother, one daughter\
  \ often mistaken as sisters, with their two huge suitcases, backpacks and sweaty\
  \ bodies tumbling through the airport in Venice, trying to carry their bodies and\
  \ luggage from one side of the airport to the other to get onto a boat.\n\nYep a\
  \ boat. \n\nTwo huge suitcases, 10 other people on board, with their 20 suitcases,\
  \ S W E A T Y & tired, but boy were we hungry, hungry for food but hungry to see\
  \ what the city of water looked like.\n\n\nAs soon as we had arrived in Venice I\
  \ was speechless, this one island, hidden from the chaos and blubber of the airport,\
  \ hidden from the rest of the world, and no matter how touristy or picturesque this\
  \ place was I felt so at ease. Myself and my mother had luckily picked a very quiet,\
  \ local and calm location in the heart of Venice, San Giacomo, a place where Venice\
  \ felt more peaceful then any location I've ever emerged myself into. \n\nNever\
  \ have I been welcomed into a city so beautifully before, the locals of San Giacomo\
  \ made us feel so at home and were so kind to offer us an experience I'll never\
  \ forget. \"Get lost in Venice, you won't regret it\", and so the next two days\
  \ consisted of a lot of pasta, night scavenging to get across one side of the island\
  \ to the other, sunsets so beautiful, more pasta, music, festivals and culture so\
  \ special that I never wanted to leave this island. \n\nThough the real highlight\
  \ of this island for me was one special man, on our first night in Venice my mother\
  \ and I were extremely hungry, so we decided to clean ourselves up and quickly fill\
  \ our stomachs. We were drawn by a festival nearby our home, practically one minute\
  \ away. The heart of San Giacomo square held this annual summer festival which included\
  \ live entertainment for hours, with many locals partying it up, barely any tourists,\
  \ me and mum were captivated. We decided to pick a small little restaurant nearby,\
  \ our waiter a local elderly gentleman who was very kind to us and also charming,\
  \ making our experience enlightening and wholesome. Now you're probably thinking,\
  \ Jules, it's their job to be as kind as possible to customers, and tourists, but\
  \ this man was so much more than that, he didn't treat us like tourists.\n\nThe\
  \ next day we decided to obviously explore Venice and boy did we explore, I'm sure\
  \ me and my mother had walked across the whole island and every-time we found a\
  \ new location we were more and more captivated with this city, and more and more\
  \ eager to find limoncello and wear some new socks that weren't wet and gross. Throughout\
  \ the day we had bumped into this gentleman and talked with him about your journeys\
  \ in Venice, and we found ourselves back at his restaurant multiple times, and every-time\
  \ our relationship with him had changed, from customers to friends. \n\nHe was so\
  \ kind every-time, and would often bring us free drinks one day, and then discount\
  \ our meal in the end to 50% making us pay merely anything, his presence and hospitality\
  \ had become so loyal to us that he was another reason we didn't want to leave Venice.\
  \ By the end of the trip, many Spritz and pizza's later he had taught us some Italian\
  \ and stole our hearts by his genuine kindness. He had given us his email, and we\
  \ promised him we would come back and visit the local suburb of San Giacomo, and\
  \ saying bye to him was just as hard as saying bye to Venice, he was truly that\
  \ one stranger who had become our Italian grandpa and wise wizard guiding us through\
  \ Venice through his stories, food, drinks, language and kindness, and for that\
  \ reason Venice was so beautiful. \n\n\u201CVoi due belli, divertitevi, per favour\u201D\
  \ \n\"You two, beautiful, enjoy please.\"\n\nThanks to you Gianni, we did, thank\
  \ you."
