Text: "The morning sunrays were caressing my tired face. I opened my eyes slowly,\
  \ taking a glimpse look around me when I suddenly heard the pilot\u2019s announcement\
  \ \u2018\u2019Bienvenidos a Madrid\u2019\u2019. Ah, Madrid. I am already here. On\
  \ the seat next to me I could feel the man\u2019s impatience for finally landing.\
  \ He kept bouncing his leg until the plane didn\u2019t stop completely.\n\nIt was\
  \ around 9 am when we landed at the airport. I took the city map out of my ripped\
  \ jeans and ended up wondering \u2018\u2019Now what?\u2019\u2019. I asked a girl\
  \ for some help on how to get to the city center. Without asking her, she told me\
  \ about her Argentinian roots and that she moved to Madrid recently with her family.\
  \ I focused on her story and how amazed she was by Madrid and its people, so I didn\u2019\
  t even realize that we already walked our way out of the airport and were about\
  \ to catch the metro. She told me about her most favorite places in Madrid. Talking\
  \ about it, I could see her eyes were shining brightly. She truly was in love with\
  \ this city and I couldn\u2019t have doubted it at all. Googling pictures of it\
  \ I was always ending up astonished by the charm it has. I was sure I would go back\
  \ home really affectionate by Madrid\u2019s glamour, though I didn\u2019t expect\
  \ to leave my heart exactly there. They say hearts always know the way. Is it so?\n\
  \nWe finally arrived at the so endearing Puerta del Sol. Crowded and busy, nevertheless\
  \ in the distance, I could hear the Mariachi cheering up everyone and making the\
  \ vibes less stressful. The girl told me she is in a rush. I thanked her and then\
  \ we parted ways. \n\nThat 16th of October the air was different and special. Autumn\
  \ breeze was dancing around me and playing with my hairs, reddening my cheeks\u2026\
  \ I sat down in front of Puerta del Sol. \u2018\u2019It is 12:30 already\u2019\u2019\
  \ \u2013 I thought. He must be coming soon. I was observing the people around. Most\
  \ of them were travelers with heavy bags, maps, trying to find their next spot for\
  \ exploring. And there, suddenly, among all these faces I saw a familiar smile.\
  \ He came closer. It was him indeed. He tried to greet me with a two cheek-kiss\
  \ as in the Spanish way, but I required the third one. Because: The more, the better\
  \ \u2013 this is the motto of my nation.\n\nAfter laughing about our cultural misunderstanding,\
  \ in an instant, it became only me, him and Madrid. Walking on the Gran Via, all\
  \ the way to the fountain of Cibeles, Puerta de Alcala and till the Retiro Park.\
  \ It was one of those perfect autumn days when you just feel like holding hands,\
  \ laughing about everything and nothing, closing your eyes and appreciating the\
  \ moment. Getting excited together about the changing of the colors of the leaves\
  \ blown along the way, the birds, the gusty wind and scent of calmness. Near the\
  \ Crystal Palace, we decided to sit and rest a bit while enjoying our view on the\
  \ lake, where swans were gently swimming while beating the air with their wings.\n\
  \n\u2018\u2019Coming to this park for roller-blading and chilling at the grass with\
  \ my friends is my favorite activity\u2019\u2019 he tried to say it in English with\
  \ a weird Spanish accent which I found really cute and alluring. \u2018\u2019But\
  \ nothing can compare the sunsets at Templo de Debod. They are undoubtedly the best\
  \ in Madrid.\u2019\u2019 \u2013 he said with a teasing smile. I couldn\u2019t wait\
  \ more but ask him, to stand up and take me there, because the sun was getting ready\
  \ for its sleep and I didn\u2019t want to miss the so perfect sunset view as he\
  \ said. We arrived in an hour at one of those special places that Madrid has \u2013\
  \ Templo de Debod. We stayed in silence and listened to the whisper of the water,\
  \ the quiet movement of the people, the mystical and peaceful air, but at the same\
  \ time way so amorous and intimate. Eye to eye, heart to heart and held together\
  \ in rhythm without ever separating, we tried the art of flying. Ah, Madrid."
