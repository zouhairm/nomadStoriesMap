Text: "At the beginning of 2018, I told myself that I would go to an off the beaten\
  \ path destination. Figuring out where was a challenge, considering how big the\
  \ world is.\n\nI settled on Ukraine. I was NOT disappointed \n\nBefore I left, everyone\
  \ kept asking me \"Why the hell would you go there?? They dont like us over there.\
  \ They have martial law!\" Blah blah blah.\n\nI'll tell you why I wanted to go there\n\
  \nI wanted to go because it's different. When you think of Eastern Europe, Ukraine\
  \ is the LAST place you think of. On top of that, you're not even ALLOWED to go\
  \ to Crimea, but that's beside the point.\n\nTo put it bluntly, this place has seen\
  \ some shit. From the Chernobyl disaster, to having Malaysia Airlines flight 17\
  \ get shot down in its airspace, to the ton of protests that have taken place in\
  \ Maidan Nezalezhnost, and to only have gained independence in 1991, I wanted to\
  \ see it for myself rather than watch tv or read a book.\n\nArmed with that knowledge,\
  \ I proceeded to be great, and boarded an Amtrak train from St Louis to Chicago,\
  \ A British Airways flight to London Heathrow, and a LOT Airlines flight to Kiev\
  \ via Warsaw, a journey of 5,308 miles over the course of 29 hours, in order to\
  \ spend 5 days there.\n\nUpon arrival in Kiev, I was flabbergasted by the cyrillic\
  \ alphabet,  considering I didn't study it before I got there. I knew communication\
  \ was going to be an issue, but hey, that's part of the adventure right?\n\nMy first\
  \ impressions of Kiev were that it was very cold, considering IT WAS the middle\
  \ of winter, a pretty cosmopolitan city compared to what I've seen on television,\
  \ and not as easy to navigate as I anticipated. \n\nWhile exploring Maidan Nezalezhnost,\
  \  I get bombarded by people dressed in animal costumes. I let my guard down because\
  \ jet lag was slowing me down, and took a photo with them....only to be told that\
  \ it would cost 60 USD after the fact! Man I was upset, but it was an expensive\
  \ lesson to learn, and to always be weary of scams. \n\nBeing in Ukraine was a truly\
  \ off the beaten path experience. I even went to the Chernobyl exclusion zone, \
  \ which was a lifelong dream of mine after watching a ton of documentaries on it.\
  \ \n\nWhen I got back home, I was bombarded with questions like \"do they like black\
  \ people in Ukraine?\", or \"is it safe to go to Chernobyl?\"\n\nI love traveling\
  \ the road less traveled. It gives me more of a hands on experience, excellent writing\
  \ material, and a broader view on the world around me.\n\nI always travel with an\
  \ open mind, rather than have my mind get molded by media stereotypes."
