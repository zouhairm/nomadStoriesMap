Text: "Let me take you back to May 11th 2017. It was a rainy night in Milan and soon\
  \ after arriving I was warmly welcomed by my Host Mother at Cadorna Station. I had\
  \ a heavy feeling in my heart, fear of the unknown that came with being just 19\
  \ and away from the comfort of home.\nHowever, I was mostly thrilled and excited\
  \ at the prospect of spending the next year as an Au Pair in Italy. \nLittle did\
  \ I know at the time that I'd soon be living La Dolce Vita!  (The Sweet Life).\n\
  \nDuring my time abroad I discovered a new side to myself. I was eager to see and\
  \ explore so many more places, try new foods and emerse myself into the Italian\
  \ culture and way of life. I enjoyed soaking up the Tuscan sun and spending hours\
  \ walking around old historic hilltop towns and big cities, to boat trips on the\
  \ South coast in Puglia, and canal cruises in Venice.\n \nVenice was the most striking\
  \ place I visited. It was everything I imagined and more. It was special to finally\
  \ stand on St Mark's square and gaze upon the magnificent Basilica and tower beside\
  \ it. I cherish a particular memory during my time there and that was just watching\
  \ the gondolas making there way in all directions on the water. It was interesting\
  \ observing this way of life and on occasion I even heard the distant sound of accordion\
  \ music and Italian song entertaining tourists and locals alike.\n\nMy passion for\
  \ food, history and art brought me to both Florence and Rome. St. Peter's Basilica\
  \ in Rome really impressed me, regardless of race, colour or creed people from all\
  \ over the world congregated to learn more about the great Roman history and the\
  \ amazing intellect of the Renaissance artists and scientists. \n\nWorking as an\
  \ Au Pair enabled me to meet and become aquainted with some amazing people on the\
  \ way. I met people from all over the world at the Italian language school I attended\
  \ in Milan. I built a good relationship with my Italian host family and the people\
  \ I worked with, happy that they are good friends I am still in contact with after\
  \ I left.\n\nI have a special treasure here at home which I created in Italy. I\
  \ kept a diary with postcards I collected for every place I visited throughout my\
  \ year. I even have a postcard from Arles in the South of France and one from St.Moritz\
  \ in Switzerland when we were on holidays. \n\nWhen the time came to go home to\
  \ Ireland, I knew I would miss the life I had in Italy. Although I was only there\
  \ for a year, it gave me an insight into a different lifestyle. I look forward to\
  \ the day I can go back."
