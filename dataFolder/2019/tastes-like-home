Text: "January can be dull in Canada. The festivities of Christmas are wrapped up\
  \ and the anticipation of snow on Christmas day is quickly replaced with the realization\
  \ that the winter climate has set in for the next four months. But this year January\
  \ marked the start of a new adventure: I was running away. \n\nI was on my way to\
  \ Greece for a three-month adventure in the sun in a sleepy beach town of Leptokaria.\
  \ On arrival I was surprised: no one really pictures the beaches of Greece to have\
  \ snow on them. A quick Google search would have revealed the truth but in my inexperienced\
  \ brazen heart, I knew that it would be warm, and I didn\u2019t give it another\
  \ thought. Well, I was wrong and it was cold and snowy. To add to my first-time\
  \ traveler learnings, central heat is apparently a North American invention, so\
  \ it was cold in the \u201Cwet-cold\u201D variety that a prairie girl from small-town\
  \ Saskatchewan couldn\u2019t have previously encountered. \n\nOne particular lonely\
  \ night in my first week there, I stumbled across a local community gathering. All\
  \ the people of the village had excitedly drug their Christmas trees, recently ousted\
  \ from their revered thrones in family rooms, to the town square. The smooth, marble\
  \ tiles of the square began to disappear beneath the towering pile of expired Christmas\
  \ trees just as the sun dipped behind Mt. Olympus. As the light from the sun disappeared,\
  \ the dark pile of trees erupted into a giant bonfire. 15 feet of flames towered\
  \ over us, casting shadows that danced around while kids dodged between adults to\
  \ compete in a game of tag. A seemingly random sing-a-long broke out among the group\
  \ as they carried the melody of a familiar tune, with words I wasn't even able to\
  \ register. I was lost in a crowd, part spectator and part intruder, and yet part\
  \ of the tradition, even as an outsider.\n\nI wandered aimlessly through the crowd,\
  \ comforted by the warmth of the flames and carried by the tune of the familiar\
  \ melody. I approached an elderly lady with two worn cherry-red mittens and she\
  \ handed me a hot chocolate and smiled, a welcoming gleam in her eyes. My acceptance\
  \ of the drink was, seemingly, an acceptance of her hospitality, and she embraced\
  \ me like a friend. We exchanged no words but a smile of understanding. I continued\
  \ to wander through the cloud of smoke engulfing the crowd. I was in a place I couldn\u2019\
  t understand, participating in a tradition that gave me no bearings. And yet hot\
  \ chocolate in hand, fire roaring and smoke wafting around us, I felt a gentle shift\
  \ to embrace whatever I would encounter in Greece. This crowd had gathered to let\
  \ go of the Christmas season and the moments - good and bad - that had marked them,\
  \ and I was letting go of my desire to understand everything around me and simply\
  \ respond to what unfolded. I was halfway around the world and yet somehow I was\
  \ home."
