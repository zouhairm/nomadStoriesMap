Text: "The fresh wind on my face and hair while I sit in the back of my tuk-tuk feels\
  \ like a relaxed moment. I have been visiting temples since very early in the morning\
  \ and the heavy and hot air is making me sluggish. As I try to fight my lethargy,\
  \ I observe my surroundings. I have no idea which temple I am visiting next. I have\
  \ already visited dozens of them. As I leave behind all the buzz and crowded main\
  \ temples like Angkor Wat, Bayon and Ta Prohm, I headed to the less known temples\
  \ of Angkor, in Siem Reap. \nMy tuk-tuk driver stops once again which means we have\
  \ arrived to a new place to visit. He is not coming with me. He indicates me the\
  \ direction I should follow and tells me he would wait for me there. He had probably\
  \ been there a million times already. Although there are plenty of trees leading\
  \ the way to the temple and the shadow feels good, the humidity and the dusty road\
  \ are like knives stabbing my lungs.\nI look at my map carefully and I find out\
  \ that the temple I am about to visit is Preah Khan. It is past noon already and\
  \ not many tourists are around. One lady is selling cold drinks outside the temple.\
  \ Apart from the birds chirping, the silence is solemn. As I cross the small bridge\
  \ on the little lake that surrounds the temple, this calm is taken by loud laughs.\
  \ This unknown happiness hits me and I suddenly feel more interested in what is\
  \ happening in the lake than what is inside the temple. I grab my camera and start\
  \ zooming to see who are they, what are they doing there. They are children on a\
  \ little boat attached to a wooden raft having fun in the lake. I got curious about\
  \ them. I wanted to know their names, I wanted to absorb all that energy and learn\
  \ everything about those wild kids. \nI get out of my way to the temple and try\
  \ to figure out how can I get to them. I walk into the forest that surrounds the\
  \ lake. That is not an easy path full of mud and rocks. As I approach the area where\
  \ they are floating on the lake, I try to get their attention. I waved at them and\
  \ they came to the lakeside. They could not speak English very well but I used all\
  \ my body language skills to ask if I could get on the boat with them. Suddenly,\
  \ I was scared. I was a full gown-up much heavier than them. Could the boat handle\
  \ the weight of all of us? They were six girls and two boys around 15 years old.\
  \ They helped me to get into the fragile and amateur boat. They had no oar and the\
  \ only way they could move was with the help of a large stick bigger than themselves\
  \ that they used to push the boat through the lake waters. After a while the fear\
  \ disappeared and I started feeling like one of them. I could not know much about\
  \ them because of the language barrier but at the same time their smile and the\
  \ fact that they welcomed me on their boat was enough for me. \nThe short trip around\
  \ the lake finished and we got out of the boat safe and sound. I invited my new\
  \ friends to have a drink with me. They left the boat behind and they seemed excited.\
  \ The drinks were on me but they were the ones who filled my heart with kindness\
  \ and joy. \nI grabbed my coke and I continued my way into the temple to explore\
  \ the ancient treasures of the Khmer empire."
