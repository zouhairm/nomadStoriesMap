Text: "The bashful face of my boss asking for spreadsheets politely in a low tone\
  \ of voice on Monday was way too different from that arrogance, disrespectful behavior\
  \ from the last Friday (and all the days before that). \nWe were working on a business\
  \ project in Manaus, Amazonas \u2013 Brazil, and as we were there temporarily, I\
  \ was trying to enjoy the city to the fullest. So, I got to know all cultural spots\
  \ and eat all local delicacies until I received an invitation from my boss to go\
  \ fishing on Solim\xF5es River, on Saturday. I would never accept to hang out with\
  \ that kind of man in an ordinary situation, but would there be another opportunity\
  \ to go fishing in Amazonas? \nJohn, my coworker, was making eye contact to me,\
  \ through the room, as the boss was speaking softly about the spreadsheets. Bossy\u2019\
  s poker face as if he was always that sweet kind of person and nothing had happened\
  \ during the weekend was priceless.\nSo, on the day of the fishing I was expecting\
  \ to have a good time in a big tourist boat, and then I wore a bikini under my clothes\
  \ because, well I thought, maybe we could dive into the river to refresh. Obviously,\
  \ I had never gone fishing before (and had not asked details about the fishing).\n\
  As soon as we got to the harbor, I saw this small non touristy boat and the boatman\
  \ waiting for us. I even hesitated to get on the boat, but some bravery took part\
  \ of my body and I said to myself \u201Ceverything\xB4s gonna be alright\u201D.\
  \ I looked at John and he was laughing (of nervous, of course). Bossy was very confident.\
  \ He had arranged everything. Me and John were the \u201Ccowards\u201D.\nOn Friday,\
  \ the day before the fishing, Bossy knocked on my room\xB4s door in a hard and loud\
  \ way pretty early in the morning. He wanted to see some reports before heading\
  \ to the client. I was still sleeping! That was so aggressive and inappropriate,\
  \ but as we were sharing the same hotel and working overtime, the boundaries between\
  \ work and personal life were unclear. To him. But what could happen on the fishing\
  \ that could make him change immediately, water to wine (or Solim\xF5es River to\
  \ Negro River)?\nBossy was drinking all the beer he himself took to the boat and\
  \ when the boat was floating on a part of the river full of Victoria Regias (Amazonia\xB4\
  s water plant, a large circle-shaped leaf), Homer Simpson put a beer can on the\
  \ leaf, to check if it would hold or sink. John and I were not approving the environmental\
  \ joke, but we remained quite, as our boss was all fun and games.\nThen, after a\
  \ good \u201Crowing\u201D, after visiting an indigenous tribe (where they begged\
  \ us money!) laughing at crocodiles and such, we were somewhere fishing: piranhas!\
  \ Whenever we threw the fishhook came out one of those carnivorous fish. I never\
  \ thought fishing was so easy ! That\xB4s when we realized we were somewhere inside\
  \ the Amazonia Forest. Amazing and terrifying. I never expected to be into the woods,\
  \ even by boat, that was magical, but I kind of didn\xB4t realize how we got there\
  \ or if the boatman knew how to get us back. Our cellphones had no signals, it was\
  \ getting dark.\nSuddenly Bossy, on a break of good sense, asked the boatman to\
  \ take us back to the harbor. We sailed the forest out and, somehow, I felt safe\
  \ just looking at the boatman\xB4s face (he felt safe, I felt safe). But some inner\
  \ voice made me also look at Bossy\xB4s face: he was pretty frightened!\nWhen we\
  \ were already on the Negro River and we could finally see the harbor, but not on\
  \ a swimming distance, it started to rain and the boat began to rock. That\xB4s\
  \ when I saw the most wonderful thing I didn\xB4t expect to find on this trip: Bossy\
  \ was crying embracing the life jacket."
