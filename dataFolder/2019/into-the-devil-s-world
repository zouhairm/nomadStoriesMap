Text: "The dynamite blast shook the mountain around us. We all jumped, terrified and\
  \ looking for the exit. But the exit leading outside was more than a kilometer away.\n\
  \nI was sitting in the fourth deepest cooperative mine shaft inside Cerro Rico (Spanish\
  \ for \u201CRich Mountain\u201D), with my tour group of six people. The dynamite\
  \ had been detonated in a nearby mine shaft by a miner from the small city of Potosi,\
  \ Bolivia, which sits at the base of the 3,900 m mountain. \n\nMining is at the\
  \ very heart of Potosi\u2019s economy. Up to 15,000 local men make their way into\
  \ these mines daily, hoping to discover a mineral vein that will bring them financial\
  \ windfall. \n\nThe men have good reason to be hopeful; Cerro Rico holds the world\u2019\
  s largest silver deposit. Since the 1550\u2019s, over 60,000 tons of silver has\
  \ been extracted from the mountain. Current estimates suggest considerable silver\
  \ still exists, along with tin, lead, zinc and an alarming amount of asbestos. \n\
  \nMy group was led by Ronald, a former Cerro Rico miner who had parleyed his 20+\
  \ hour mining work days into more humane hours as a guide. As he led us through\
  \ the primary mine entrance, we walked in single file, making our way with only\
  \ the meager light from our aging headlamps. Within minutes, we were hunched over\
  \ as the space became progressively tighter \u2013 eventually crawling on our hands\
  \ and knees, and sometimes slithering on our stomachs, to get through the tunnels\
  \ between mine shafts. The tight spaces made me claustrophobic, causing me to panic\
  \ and inhale thick, dust-saturated air. \n\nRonald assured us we were safe. The\
  \ mine shafts were bare rock on most sides, supporting by criss-crossing layers\
  \ of aging, mineral-encrusted wood beams. In spite of assurances, I wondered how\
  \ long the thick beams had been there, and prayed they\u2019d hold up until I got\
  \ out of the mountain. \n\nMy tour group (and every miner in the mountain) had good\
  \ reason to be worried. In spite of being labeled a World Heritage site, mining\
  \ in Cerro Rico is unregulated and without safety standards. When the government\
  \ stopped subsidizing mines in the 1950s, small mining cooperatives evolved to extract\
  \ minerals. Today a maze of mine shafts and tunnels snakes through Cerro Rico, making\
  \ the mountain more like a piece of Swiss cheese. \n\nThe mining activity comes\
  \ with significant risk. Many suggest it\u2019s only a matter of time before the\
  \ mountain collapses. With this instability, it\u2019s impossible to know when a\
  \ mine shaft might collapse, pinning untold workers beneath the rock. Perhaps worse,\
  \ the miners inhale a deadly mix of gases and dust daily, leading to premature lung\
  \ disease. A miner\u2019s life expectancy is a short 35-45 years, compared to the\
  \ average Potosi non-miner who lives 60-70 years. \n\nFor the men of Potosi, the\
  \ potential income from mining in Cerro Rico outweighs the risk. The average man\
  \ working in Potosi earns about 700 Bolivianos ($100 US) monthly. In the mines,\
  \ they can earn up to 2000 Bolivianos ($290 US) \u2013 or significantly more if\
  \ they hit a silver vein. \n\nAs Ronald guided us through the mine, we often stopped\
  \ to talk to miners. We gave the men bags of whole, dried coca leaves. Ronald explained\
  \ these gifts were intended to thank the miners for allowing us into their realm\
  \ and as an offering to El Tio (\u201Cthe Uncle\u201D), the devil-like being that\
  \ is said to control the world beneath: the world of the miners. Every Friday, some\
  \ of the men gather at a clay statue of El Tio to say a prayer of thanks and leave\
  \ offerings \u2013 all in hopes that El Tio would graciously grant the miners protection\
  \ as they continued their work. \n\nAs the dynamite blast shook rocks from the mine\
  \ shaft walls and fell around me, I hoped my group had brought sufficient offerings\
  \ to appease El Tio. Being inside El Tio\u2019s world is humbling, evoking a sense\
  \ of unpredictability and dread. I found myself joining in with the miners to say\
  \ a little prayer, \u201CPlease, El Tio, continue to be kind.\u201D"
