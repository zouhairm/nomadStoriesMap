Text: "I\u2019d been followed to Italy by a wet, body-shaking cough and fever, and\
  \ both were getting worse. I suspected a chest infection, which meant antibiotics,\
  \ which meant a hospital visit. I had heard plenty about public services in Italy,\
  \ none of it good. I resigned myself to a long, frustrating day.\n\nBeing a tourist\
  \ town, Sorrento\u2019s hospital has a translator, named Maria, sitting by the door,\
  \ and I described my symptoms. \u2018Sorry to waste your time on something so trivial\u2019\
  , I said, \u2018but I'm diabetic, so -\u2018\n\n\u2018Diabetic\u2019 was the magic\
  \ word. Maria interrupted, urging me to sit. Within minutes I was admitted to Emergency.\
  \ Italian hospitals have a colour-coded triage system - code red is deadly serious,\
  \ literally, then it's down through yellow, green and white. Code white is presumably\
  \ for minor, time-wasting complaints, because they charge \u20AC25. Anything above\
  \ white is free. Italian or visitor, it doesn't matter: they waved away my credit\
  \ card. I was a code yellow.\n\nI was presented to a senior doctor, who asked staccato\
  \ questions about symptoms before passing me onto someone more junior. Maria followed.\
  \ Doc Junior approached with a lancet the size of a small sword and said he would\
  \ test my blood sugar, but there was no way I was letting him near me with that\
  \ horror. I held him off while I extracted my own, less terrifying lancet from my\
  \ bag.\n\nMy blood sugar level was three times what it should be, and that changed\
  \ everything. I was marched to a bed and instructed to lie down. The doctor approached\
  \ to my left with another sword - no argument possible now, he was taking pathology\
  \ tests - and a nurse appeared on my right with clamps for an electrocardiogram.\n\
  \nElectrocardiogram? \n\nWhile I was busy insisting the clamps were unnecessary\
  \ - that I just needed antibiotics - the pathology test was finished, and before\
  \ I could turn to defend my left flank a drip had appeared in my arm. This was getting\
  \ out of hand. The doctor said he would inject me with insulin. \u2018Sure\u2019\
  , I said, \u2018just let me get mine from my bag and -\u2018\n\n\"No\", Maria interrupted.\
  \ \"You have come to hospital and while you are in the hospital you will only use\
  \ the hospital's medicine\".\n\n... right. \n\nECG done, drip in, insulin injected,\
  \ pathology results pending, I didn\u2019t know what was next but hoped it involved\
  \ getting a prescription and being sent away. When I asked Maria when I might leave,\
  \ though, I was told I wasn't going anywhere, not until the blood sugar was down,\
  \ and then they'd need to take x-rays.\n\nX-rays? \n\nThe wait took an hour, during\
  \ which my blood sugar was re-checked twice - it was falling rapidly - and the drip\
  \ was replaced with a second bag, despite my protests that I had a perfectly good\
  \ water bottle instead. Eventually the x-ray studio was available, and an orderly\
  \ approached with a wheelchair.\n\nWheelchair!?\n\nThis was too much. \u2018I walked\
  \ nearly 3km from my hostel\u2019, I said, \u2018I can walk to the lifts\u2019.\
  \ But no, I had come to an Italian hospital, and Italian hospital patients get pushed\
  \ around in wheelchairs. I was at least allowed to walk inside the studio, but despite\
  \ demonstrating that I was fully ambulant I was ordered back into the chair to return\
  \ to the ER. There we waited - I was reluctantly permitted to stand - until the\
  \ x-rays arrived and showed that yes, I had a chest infection, and I was at last\
  \ prescribed antibiotics.\n\n\"You can leave now\", Maria said, \"but would you\
  \ prefer to be admitted?\"\n\nNo, thank you.\n\nTo my amusement, gratitude and shame,\
  \ the Italian health system took my illness far more seriously than I did. Within\
  \ two hours I was triaged, given insulin, had pathology tests, an ECG, an x-ray\
  \ and two drips. I was looked after by two doctors, a nurse, translator and orderly.\
  \ If I hadn't felt confident managing my condition I could have stayed. I wasn\u2019\
  t charged a cent. I\u2019d expected many things of Italy, but the best, most generous\
  \ health care I\u2019ve ever received wasn\u2019t one."
