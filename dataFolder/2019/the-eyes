Text: "I travel to expand the barriers of conditioning. To go over the limiting beliefs\
  \ that blindly guide us through life. I travel for the nature and the adventures.\
  \ I feel deeply connected and belonging when surrounded by natural sights. Although,\
  \ I find the biggest challenges in human connection. The beauty of overcoming cultural\
  \ and language barriers and finding the place where we all meet: deep in the heart.\
  \ \nI was in between sea expeditions, sailing from the Channel Islands back to Santa\
  \ Barbara in California when I decided to go the local farmers Market on State Street.\
  \ I planned to get some fresh food and then go back to the boat. I'd be heading\
  \ to Baja in Mexico in couple hours so I thought it would be nice to have a very\
  \ decent meal with the crew before we leave. \nI was slowly browsing through all\
  \ that green wonderland, tasting the fruit samples, smelling the flowery essence\
  \ that was typical from that place. I kept walking until I found the local musician\
  \ that was playing this very mellow but uplifting song. The perfect soundtrack for\
  \ that warm and golden day. I faced him and our eyes crossed. I saw his journey\
  \ is his wrinkles. We smiled at each other and when he finished he asked me \"what\
  \ brings you here?\". \"The people\", I replied. \"What about us?\" He kept going.\
  \ \"There is some wisdom you Californians carry around\", I said. \"Oh, I agree.\
  \ Do you what it is? No, I don't. It's the magic. We believe in magic. Then he went\
  \ on and started to play a next song.\nYes, definitely it was the magic. It was\
  \ the same mysterious element that would make me go back to that harbor once in\
  \ a while. The magic."
