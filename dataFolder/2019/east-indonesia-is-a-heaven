Text: "How can you live between the sea and the mountain but you never go there?\n\
  I'm watching videos about what my country has makes me want to feel that beauty\
  \ up close. I want to go around my country and see with my own eyes what my country\
  \ has. I live in Jakarta but I was born in Pematangsiantar, North Sumatra, one of\
  \ the five largest islands in my country. When I was in college I vowed to start\
  \ my journey from East Indonesia, East Nusa Tenggara.\nIt happened in May, 2018.\
  \ I went with my friends, travelling from Ende, East Nusa Tenggara until Labuan\
  \ Bajo, East Nusa Tenggara. It is around 430 kms. We went to Wologai village who\
  \ still retain their traditional customs. And for the first time, I can\u2019t step\
  \ on some land because it is the grave of their ancestors. They only use that area\
  \ if there is a traditional celebration. And we went to Kelimutu National Park to\
  \ get the tri-colored crater lakes. We need to climb thousands of stairs to get\
  \ those lakes. the tri-colored crater lakes have different color at the same time,\
  \ light blue, dark blue and green. That was really amazing !\nNext day we went to\
  \ Wae Rebo village. It is located in Ruteng, East Manggarai, 1,200 meters above\
  \ sea level. We need 3-4 hours to go there with trekking. It is a remote area, no\
  \ signal, no electricity. They make solar power plant and use lamp only from 6 pm\
  \ until 10 pm. I was so happy because I never trekking before and at the end of\
  \ the journey I see heaven, Wae Rebo village. The village completely surrounded\
  \ by panoramic mountains. The village has received the Top Award of Excellence from\
  \ UNESCO in the 2012 UNESCO Asia Pacific Heritage Awards. They have unique house,\
  \ tall, conical in shape and are completely covered in lontar thatch from its rooftop\
  \ down to the ground. We stay there at night and the air was really really cool.\
  \ I never regret to go there and I really want to go back if I have a chance.\n\
  We continue our trip to Komodo island. Finally once in my life, I saw Komodo dragon.\
  \ They are so big with slow steps but looks manly. We are so close and it made me\
  \ feel afraid but happy at the same time. They really really have a good attitude.\
  \ \nThen we start sailing on Komodo island, go to Padar island, Gili Lawa island\
  \ and surprisingly we found another amazing view. We found dolphins around us. I\
  \ think it\u2019s more than fifty dolphins. They swim exactly around our ship. Our\
  \ captain took the ship to spin in that area to play with dolphins. And yea, I also\
  \ found fly fish and dozens of turtles on the high seas.\nIt was only one side of\
  \ my country. There is still a lot more extraordinary scenery that my country has.\
  \ I wish I have time and chance to go to another place and find something that I\
  \ never find before."
