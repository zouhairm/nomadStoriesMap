Text: "At five years old my family relocated from Haiti to a modest city on the coast\
  \ of Florida. There was nothing spectacular about this place other than the fact\
  \ that it was in 1. America, and 2. It was not an island. There is not much I can\
  \ recollect from when I was that young, but I know for certain that at that time\
  \ I had never heard the word \u2018America\u2019 before, and I did not occur to\
  \ me that when I was told we would be moving my mother meant permanently. That being\
  \ said, it was hard for me to wrap my head around American customs, and trying to\
  \ fit into a culture where I felt there was no room for me. As I navigated this\
  \ new world the feeling only worsened, the feeling of being a square peg attempting\
  \ to fit into a round hole. I was an outlier looking in, my corners to sharp, my\
  \ accent too thick, my features too ethnic, in summation, I was too different. At\
  \ home, my family had no idea of the internal war raging within me, the embarrassment\
  \ and shame stemming from such an integral part of my identity. \nTherefore, over\
  \ the years I would go on to learn English, and while the disconnect between my\
  \ identity, my culture, and American culture would shrink, the feeling of not quite\
  \ fitting in never fully dissipated. I was constantly bombarded with the media\u2019\
  s portrayal of my country, as well as the endless patronization from my peers making\
  \ it difficult to conjure up confidence about where I came from. It was difficult\
  \ trying to connect the images of Haiti, in addition to the commercials being shown\
  \ on television to my memories. In my search for self-discovery, I would go out\
  \ of my way to find other Haitians with the hopes that they had the same memories\
  \ I had of Haiti. The idea of ever returning to Haiti was encompassed with longing\
  \ and trepidation. What if everything is as the commercials say? What if I no longer\
  \ fit in there either? What if, what if, what if. My world came to a standstill\
  \ when one sunny day in May 2016 my mother informed that our tickets to Haiti have\
  \ been purchased, and we would be spending half the summer in Haiti beginning June\
  \ 1st. I was struck with the feeling of dread knowing that I would finally be confronting\
  \ the reality for myself of what used to be my home. Time seemed to fly by, and\
  \ before I know it my family was packing up the car and I was being whisked away\
  \ to the airport. \nSurprisingly, when I arrived in Haiti I did not expect to find\
  \ myself. The entirety of summer 16 was filled with love and laughter. I gained\
  \ new perspectives and understanding. The first few days I reacquainted myself with\
  \ the landscape, reliving my early childhood memories whilst creating new ones.\
  \ Going to Haiti I was able to confront my fears, the idea that \u2018home\u2019\
  \ can only be one place completely dispersed from my mind. I realized that I can\
  \ still appreciate aspects of different cultures even if they do not align with\
  \ my own, that participating in other cultures did not have to mean I appreciate\
  \ mine any less. My neighbor Billy told me \u201C I was not any less Haitian because\
  \ I did not live in Haiti, or because Americans thought that my country was in shambles\u201D\
  . I tackled my fear of fitting in and realized I did not have to fit in with the\
  \ majority to belong. The notion that I can only relate to those who are similar\
  \ to me may be true on a marginal scale did not give me an excuse to not try to\
  \ form relationships with others. The relief was palpable, I felt reaffirmed in\
  \ my identity and confidence for the first time that I was ready to fully engage\
  \ in the world."
