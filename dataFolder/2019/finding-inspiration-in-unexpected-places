Text: "I am an Autistic Artist and Writer. The world can be an incredibly daunting\
  \ place, but there's so much to see and do. The Netherlands was a place I always\
  \ wanted to explore. The history, being so much older then what I am used to made\
  \ me feel like I was stepping in to another world. Initially, I came for the art.\
  \ Piet Mondrian being the main draw. I was in awe, staring at those masterpieces\
  \ in the Stedelijk Museum. You know how you \"dare to dream\" that one day you'll\
  \ see something in person that you've admired in magazines, on cans of hairspray\
  \ and in popular culture? This was my time and I felt as though I was in some kind\
  \ of magical daydream. \n\nI had seen something world-famous and highly respected\
  \ and I felt as though nothing could top this experience.\nThat is, until, I met\
  \ a living, breathing, Dutch Artist and saw him sing and dance while he painted.\
  \ His art, being his instrument and the colours being the vivid music I could see\
  \ coming to fruition in front of my very eyes. \nHis name was Harry and he welcomed\
  \ us in to his studio with open arms. His bright colours reminded me of the work\
  \ I do. \n\nHaving such an artistic experience abroad and meeting someone who truly\
  \ lived through his work was breathtaking. I still think of it fondly to this very\
  \ day."
