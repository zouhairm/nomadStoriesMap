Text: "I needed to get out of Canada, well the part of Canada I was residing in. The\
  \ most southern town in Canada, Kingsville Ontario. \nThere is nothing there, I\
  \ wanted adventure and something new. I had never been outside of Canada & the US.\
  \ I had never been on a plane, or felt the feeling of being 10,000 ft off the ground.\
  \ \nOne day my cousin texted me and asked me spontaneously if I wanted to go to\
  \ Iceland? And I thought that\u2019s different, my first time travelling, but to\
  \ Iceland? But of course I said yes, and the country I had the least interest in\
  \ travelling to became my second home. I fell in love with Iceland the second I\
  \ walked out of the airport and the sun rose, the first thing I saw was a huge sign\
  \ in a different language other than English or French, and that made it feel so\
  \ real to me. When the daylight hit I saw no grass, it was blue teal hot water and\
  \ lava rocks but heavy winds. The first place we went to within the first two hours\
  \ was the blue lagoon. Did I get massive windburn? Yes. Was it worth it?  Of course,\
  \ I\u2019ve never been in a hot spring before. Mountains, hot springs, volcanos,\
  \ glaciers were everywhere. This country made me fall in love with nature, all my\
  \ travels were in the US. Which is so commercialized and entertainment based, buildings,\
  \ shows, Hollywood. Iceland was small little beach houses, the ocean and horses\
  \ everywhere. There were no tall buildings or celebrities sightings. It\u2019s a\
  \ long ring road surrounded by rock and glaciers. Some places were hot and some\
  \ were cold. I saw the northern lights, the original geysir, hiked on tall rock\
  \ hills and snowmobiled on a glacier. I was sad to leave, I had fallen in love with\
  \ this place and still think about it everyday. I can\u2019t wait to bring my future\
  \ family there. Since then I\u2019ve just wanted to get on a plane again, so I visited\
  \ Alberta, Canada a few months after, my second time on a plane was in the same\
  \ year of 2018, I didn\u2019t want to stop and I never want to stop."
