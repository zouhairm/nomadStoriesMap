Text: "As my college career came to a close, the possibility of taking a trip to celebrate\
  \ became a reality. My closest friends and I had always planned taking a trip across\
  \ country together; but time can sure change plans. As the years went on, we simply\
  \ got separated. We went to different schools. We met different groups of people.\
  \ We grew to become ourselves. Of course when we are back in our hometown, we get\
  \ together, we have some laughs, and we reminisce about the great times. All those\
  \ laughs helped us forget that we never went west with the boys like we planned.\
  \ Joey could never afford it, Mike was working all the time, Cody fell of the face\
  \ of the earth; Andrew and I were the only two willing to head west and see that\
  \ California coast. We tried to get our whole group to go, had we waited for the\
  \ boys to get their sh*t together, there would be no story to tell. So come spring\
  \ break of our senior years, Andy and I booked a ticket to Cali. We booked our room\
  \ in a small hotel in Redondo Beach. We thought it was a nice deal and not too far\
  \ from the City of Angels. Graduation came and went, our families wished us well,\
  \ and away to the west we went. Our flight out of lovely Newark International was\
  \ delayed 3 hours. We got up early just to sit in the terminal until mid day. Andrew\
  \ was a little sour, but I was golden; for I knew I would be In California soon\
  \ enough. Our rental car expierence was the next obstacle we did not prepare for.\
  \ Andrew looked up a cheap rental company that we both never heard of. When they\
  \ hit us with the final price\u2014 it was shockingly double what we had expected\
  \ to pay. I was upset about the money. But Andrew summed it up perfectly\u2014 he\
  \ looked at me and said \u201Cdon\u2019t sweat it bro, we\u2019re here\u201D. Drew\
  \ was right. We got to Cali. The sun was shining and we were all smiles. We then\
  \ got to our hotel. Oh. My. Goodness. We spent a total of 10 minutes in the room\
  \ before deciding to head to target and buy a bedspread! We were laughing the entire\
  \ time, for nothing could bother us. We got ourselves to California, like she had\
  \ planned and discussed for years. Our boys back home were texting us things like\
  \ \u201Cgood for you bro, you got there\u201D. The rest of the trip went wonderfully.\
  \ We sampled the West Coast\u2019s finest medicine, toured the studios, swam in\
  \ the Pacific, and hiked out in Malibu. We had the best Mexican food of our lives.\
  \ We met beautiful women in Santa Monica. We toured the celebrity houses. We did\
  \ it all. Although we were hit with things we were not prepared for. We were never\
  \ phased. Our spirits were never diminished. We went west and lived it up. The trip\
  \ provided laughs that will last a lifetime, and memories that will  last even longer.\
  \ As we headed home, ready to enter the real world, we both had an understanding\
  \ that we will be back west some day. I\u2019m glad we decided to just go. Because\
  \ waiting for the things you want gets you nowhere. If you are uncertain or nervous\
  \ of traveling to a place you have never been, consider this: would you stay put\
  \ in your comfort zone forever, or would you go west and evolve into your true self.\
  \ Drew and I are still best friends, and can not wait to take another trip and not\
  \ know what to expect. That\u2019s more than half of the fun."
