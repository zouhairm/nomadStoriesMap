Text: "I am not new to arriving in a country where I barely know the language, but\
  \ this time the experience was amplified by encountering for the first time a nation\
  \ where the Roman alphabet was not in common use. It was like arriving in another\
  \ world, and the attitude of the immigration and customs officials towards an unfamiliar\
  \ passport represented the first unsettling challenge of my trip. I thought I was\
  \ off to a bad start. After having been delayed for what seemed to be an eternity,\
  \ and after my host had been made to sign some or other indemnification, I was introduced\
  \ to the real Russia - a country of peoples frosty on the outside, but hearty as\
  \ a hearth on the inside. I was soon consuming a rich bowl of borscht and munching\
  \ on black bread, both staples of the winter Russian menu.\n\nMy adventures into\
  \ the interior of Moscow began promptly on the next day with a trip to the Red Square,\
  \ and an attempt to visit the Moscow Kremlin in vain, because it was closed for\
  \ the day. There was nonetheless not a shortage of things to do, as I explored the\
  \ splendour of the department stores at GUM, and the remarkable frescoes on the\
  \ walls of the colourful and eccentric Saint Basil's Cathedral. The wintry weather\
  \ was incidentally my first experience of snow, since I come from, and have always\
  \ lived in the tropics, and I took full advantage of the opportunity to try my hand,\
  \ or rather, my feet, at ice-skating at the mammoth VDNKh ice-skating rink. It showed\
  \ me the playful side of the Russian Muscovite public and that they too, apart from\
  \ popular belief, have a zest for life and all things fun. Reminders of Russia's\
  \ Soviet past that is still very fresh scatter across the cityscape of Moscow, with\
  \ tributes and statues here and there of some or other leader of the Communist Party\
  \ of the Soviet Union, notably the very many busts of Vladimir Lenin. This is in\
  \ stark contrast to entirely lacking Tsarist legacy in Moscow, but for a massive\
  \ contemporary artwork on the banks of the Moskova river. One can discern from this\
  \ the policy of erasure of the Bolsheviks in Moscow. \n\nGardens, ice cream wrapped\
  \ in paper, ducks navigating frozen waterways, people hurrying about their business\
  \ to avoid being outside in the cold, and nighttime activity of the young people\
  \ in Moscow's many anti-caf\xE9s punctuated the rest of my time in the city. It\
  \ was entirely worth the risk, to plunge into the unknown, to dash stereotypes,\
  \ to challenge misconceptions, to banish prejudice and to appreciate the cultural\
  \ differences of a proud and hospitable people. I came away from Moscow with a new\
  \ attitude, new comrades, and luckily for me, a new desire to learn a new language."
