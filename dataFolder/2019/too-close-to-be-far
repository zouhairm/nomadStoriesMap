Text: "Travelling, who doesn't love travelling? But how about travelling when your\
  \ body is one part and your mind in another one? This was my experience on my first\
  \ travel to Portugal. I have always wanted to go to this beautiful country, but\
  \ I never imagined what was about to happen. Life changes every single day, but\
  \ often we aren't prepared to face this changes. I guess that's the beauty of life,\
  \ the power to adapt, to resist, even when you feel you are not prepared. \n\nLet\
  \ me begin by saying that there's nothing that I love more in life than travelling\
  \ and speaking several languages. That was precisely the beauty of that country,\
  \ that I could visit it by learning a culture and by speaking Portuguese. So, I\
  \ was in Porto, this astonishing city full of wonderful people, delicious wine,\
  \ cheap food and a gorgeous river to walk by and to sit next to it to read a book.\
  \ For me knowing a country goes beyond going to its famous touristic places, it\
  \ means loosing between the streets, talking with local people, eating in traditional\
  \ little beautiful restaurants (not in Mcdonald please), reading about its history,\
  \ and just contemplating the view it offers us. Who did I learn this from? My grandma,\
  \ one of the most beautiful and wonderful persons I have ever had the chance to\
  \ meet. This is actually her story, I think you as readers should know for me it's\
  \ an honor to be writing about her.\n\nIt hadn't been an easy week. Let me explain\
  \ you, my family lives in Colombia (Yes, that's right \xA1I am from Colombia!) and\
  \ for days they have told me that my grandmother was not feeling good, they had\
  \ to take her to the hospital and she was there for almost a week. She was 94 years\
  \ old (yes, as you can guess now, she is not alive anymore, but don't worry I promise\
  \ you this story doesn't have a sad ending) so her health state was not the best\
  \ one, but still I saw her as the strongest woman on the earth. Off course, I was\
  \ feeling really sad because of that, but my family told me to continue travelling\
  \ since that was my grandma's favourite hobby. But one night things got ugly, and\
  \ I had the worst night. I was afraid of watching my phone, cause something on my\
  \ mind told me there was something wrong. However, when I got the strength to do\
  \ it, I saw the message of my parents: \"Your grandmother is no longer with us.\"\
  \ \n\nAs you can imagine I was devasted, I cried like a little child and I just\
  \ wanted to go back home, to be there with my family, just not to feel alone. Sadly,\
  \ this was not possible for me. It was too expensive and my family told me that\
  \ it was not what my grandma would have wanted. So I just had to accept it. I put\
  \ on my shoes and even though it was the darkest and coldest day I knew I had to\
  \ do it for her. If not, I would have disapointed her, and definitely that was not\
  \ I wanted. As my family told me, she was going to be by my side, and my eyes were\
  \ going to be her eyes. So I went to Porto's  funicular, I bought a one-way ticket\
  \ (because I just wanted to walk through the streets and to get lost in them). On\
  \ my way down I cried like a have never do it before, I drank a glass of wine, I\
  \ walked along the river but just for a while because the pain was too strong, so\
  \ at the end I just went back to my room to sleep. But the next day everything changed,\
  \ I went to Foz Beach, I sat down in front of the sea eating a \"Tapioca\" (traditional\
  \ portuguese dish) and there I had the perfect final conversation with my grandma,\
  \ I found the peace I was looking for and that I didn't expect to find so soon,\
  \ but that's a story to be finished in another occassion..."
