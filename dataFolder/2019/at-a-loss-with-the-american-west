Text: "We drove out of Los Angeles at dusk while Kim & Jessie by M83 played on the\
  \ radio. The glittering city got further away in the rearview, framed by a West\
  \ Coast sunset straight out of a retro postcard. I\u2019ve never seen dark blue\
  \ melt into a fierce orange so seamlessly. The gradient felt so unashamedly Californian,\
  \ I wanted to drink it in and keep it forever. \n\nForever doesn\u2019t last, unfortunately.\
  \ The glimmering city lights faded into the background and I focused on the road\
  \ ahead of us. Reality settled in again. Tomorrow was the beginning of our American\
  \ West road trip. An adventure we had excitedly been planning for months, but now\
  \ seemed like a sad task - an expensive distraction. Shaun and I had separated barely\
  \ two weeks ago and here we were. Driving in silence down the 405 freeway while\
  \ M83\u2019s euphoric synths filled the air. Although sad, I couldn\u2019t help\
  \ but smile in that moment.\n\nWe arrived in the small town of Sedona late in the\
  \ afternoon. The sky was alight with violets and pinks, adding a hazy nostalgia\
  \ to the stunning red rocks, ablaze in the setting sun. I was immediately filled\
  \ with a spark - a burning need to explore right away. I wanted to scramble Sedona\u2019\
  s big rocks and take it all in from the highest point I could haul myself up to.\
  \ Of course, that would have to wait until tomorrow. I barely slept. \n\nThe warm\
  \ days that followed gave us something. We enjoyed solace together, lifted from\
  \ the burdens of domestic arguments and furniture splitting. We were together and\
  \ alone at the same time. I soaked myself in the eerie silence that descended between\
  \ the natural pillars of Cathedral Rock. The warm earth pressed against my bare\
  \ skin and it felt alive beneath me. I felt peace and unease in equal parts; there\
  \ was a natural spirit in this place that left me feeling connected.\n\nFor once\
  \ in my life, I was happy to sit still. We found a quiet flat up a side of Bell\
  \ Rock during our climb and sat there for a while. Two exes, side by side, elevated.\
  \ The dust of the earth filled my pores, the scent of the sky filled my lungs and\
  \ our shared acceptance of that moment filled my soul. The silence was no longer\
  \ tense. Everything was okay between us. We were as we should be and it felt better\
  \ than before. \n\nLong days faded into cool, crisp evenings. On a drive back to\
  \ our hotel room, I convinced Shaun to pull over so we could check out the night\
  \ sky. One thing we had never agreed on, was the worthiness of stargazing. However,\
  \ this one night, the feeling towards it became mutual. Sedona\u2019s dark sky exploded\
  \ into thousands of glittering specks, eager to shine. They cast a faint glow over\
  \ the land below, giving the rocks a deep red blush, barely visible among the black\
  \ night. I heard Shaun mutter a \u201CWow, okay.\u201D under his breath as he stepped\
  \ out of the car. He finally understood my fascination with outer space. He saw\
  \ it looking back at him, he felt the small feeling it gives. Peace by day and peace\
  \ by night were completely different concepts here. The land made you feel small,\
  \ the universe made it known that you were insignificant. Again, I was comforted\
  \ by the fact that Shaun and I were okay. There was a bigger, more exciting picture\
  \ out there. \n\nI will always have those long drives through the West. Never in\
  \ one place long enough to feel acquainted, but long enough to touch the warm earth\
  \ and let it change us. Although the weight of reality waited for us back at home,\
  \ this was not home. America was our dreamscape, and Sedona our deep sleep."
