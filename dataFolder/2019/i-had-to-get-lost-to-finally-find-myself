Text: "In the middle of nowhere, lost between snow mountains and frost lakes, there\
  \ was I, sick after two days, weak and as lonley as never, but learning a priceless\
  \ lesson... \n\nFor a long time I thought that I had to get away from the people,\
  \ that the world's greatest problem was human kind, so than I started to practice\
  \ trekking all by myself, I had climbed many mountains crossed many tracks, but\
  \ that one was kinda especial.\n\nThe year was 2017, the same year I had conquer\
  \ great things, was the one I had lost the only one that mattered to me, my beloved\
  \ grandmother, the woman who rised me. After that I decided to cross the hardest\
  \ track I've ever been, and after some researches I decided to go to Patagonia,\
  \ all alone as I used to.\n\nPatagonia it's an huge place, with stunning landscapes\
  \ and a great wildlife. There, in the same day you can face a Sun of 25 oC, and\
  \ suddenly face a snow storm with 180 km/h winds. A place as beautiful as hard.\n\
  \nThe circuit I've planned to go by would take 7 days of trekking to be completed.\
  \ I started the track and at the final of the third day of walk I got sick, an aggressive\
  \ virosis that took me down while I was alone into the woods between the cold mountains.\n\
  \nThere was I, with a 25 kg backpack, 1 day of walk of distance from the closest\
  \ rescue point. The only option presented to me in this situation was to be strong.\
  \ So even without been able to eat or drink anything, I put on my backpack and decided\
  \ to carry my body through that mountains until the rescue point.\n\nBut after 7\
  \ hours of walking, I stopped to breathe, and than I realized I was in the most\
  \ beautiful place I've ever seen in my whole life. I was seated on a rock, the only\
  \ one in a great field, which was covered by a short yellow grass, where I could\
  \ see very far, but couldn't see no one. As the background there was only an imponnent\
  \ ridge composed by dark mountains with white snow on top.\n\nBefore a I could think,\
  \ I felt something I can't even describe, my eyes were dizzy and the first thought\
  \ in my head was, \"I've never felt so happy, so complete ... I want to take a picture\
  \ to show to Grandma when I get back\" right before that, I remembered that she\
  \ would not be at home. The next thought was \"no, she's here\" and then I cried,\
  \ by pure happiness, and I decided not to photograph that place.\n\nThis moment\
  \ will always exist, only in my memory and perhaps when I close my eyes, it will\
  \ be the last thing I will remember, and I will be at peace, anyway. The fact it's\
  \ that that day I found out a great teaching... That I shall not get away from the\
  \ people, but look for e get close of good people, I found out that when something\
  \ it's so good, so beautiful, we need someone who we love to share it, I found out\
  \ that happiness really only its real whe it's shared.\n\nAfter that I walked until\
  \ the rescue point and even that my body was broken, I felt as my soul had been\
  \ fixed."
