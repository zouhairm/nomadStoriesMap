Text: "I had no opportunity to thank him again. We both went our ways, without exchanging\
  \ numbers or an email address. I didn\u2019t even know his name. It was not the\
  \ money that left me speechless, but his random act of kindness that touched me.\n\
  But let\u2019s start at the beginning. I was on my way from Germany to Taiwan flying\
  \ over Zurich and Shanghai.  I reached Zurich at the break of dawn. Got myself an\
  \ ridiculously overpriced coffee, which I hoped would wake me up before I boarded\
  \ my plane to Shanghai. On the plane I sat next to an Chinese man in his mid 40ies.\
  \ For the flight attendants bought us lunch and I could feel that my seat neighbor\
  \ was eager to start a conversation, but he couldn\u2019t speak English. So he chose\
  \ different ways to communicate.  With a bright smile he offered me fruit bonbons\
  \ and chocolate that he pulled out of his backpack like a magician, who pulls rabbits\
  \ out of his head. It went on like that. Until he saw me reading a German book.\
  \ He started talking to me in German. He didn\u2019t speak well, but enough for\
  \ a conversation. He told me that he was working as a waiter in a Chinese restaurant\
  \ in Germany.  He told me that he has to work overtime a lot. That\u2019s why he\
  \ spends most of his time with his Chinese colleagues and seldom with Germans. \
  \ He was on his way home to visit his family in Shanghai. I had never been to Shanghai\
  \ nor China, so I started to ask questions about his country. It wasn\u2019t hard\
  \ to tell, how happy he was to share some stories about his home with me. He told\
  \ me about eastern medicine and showed me which point to press on my hand that would\
  \ help me to relax and fall asleep, because I told him that I always had a trouble\
  \ falling asleep on the plane, while everyone else  around me was dozing off as\
  \ soon as they where in their seat. He continued telling me about customs and food\
  \ in China and how much he had loved it to be a chef.  Around 10 years ago, he used\
  \ to work as a chef in a restaurant in Italy. You could see is eyes light up just\
  \ thinking about it. He showed me pictures and I could tell how much he would love\
  \ to go back to these times in Tuscany. By now Shanghai was only one hour away.\
  \ He asked me, if I had Yuan, the Chinese currency, for my stopover, I shook my\
  \ head. It was only a 5 hours stopover and I didn\u2019t bother to exchange money.\
  \ He grabbed into his magical backpack again pulled out his wallet and gave me two\
  \ notes. I didn\u2019t want to accept it, but he insisted. For a coffee he said,\
  \ so I took the money. I felt more thankful for the gesture, than the money, assuming\
  \ it might be worth 3 Euros to buy a drink. The plane landed, I thanked him again\
  \ and we said our goodbyes. I had 5 hours to kill. It took me one hour, to figure\
  \ out how to get Wi-Fi. Once I finally had it, it was kind of useless, because most\
  \ of the websites I use are blocked in China. Then I decided to buy a coffee. I\
  \ checked how much money the man from the plane had given me. I stared at the currency\
  \ converter on my phone with confusion, the screen said 30 Euros. A man who had\
  \ didn\u2019t earn much, had given me 30 Euros, just because he wanted me to feel\
  \ welcomed in Shanghai, his home. I was blown away by so much kindness that was\
  \ expecting nothing in return. I wanted to thank him again, I wanted to tell him\
  \ how much his gesture had touched me. But I couldn\u2019t, because I didn\u2019\
  t even know his name. I couldn\u2019t stop smiling that day, sharing his kindness\
  \ with everyone I met along the way. From the money I bought a neckless that whenever\
  \ I wear it, it reminds me to be kind to strangers, it can make their day."
