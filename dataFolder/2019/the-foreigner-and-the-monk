Text: "I had just arrived in Thailand. I was set on the idea of becoming an English\
  \ teacher here. I had met a friend on my first day here, that wanted to take me\
  \ to see a couple of temples. We walked around the city all day and ended up at\
  \ Wat Phra Singh. Both of us were really tired, we had been walking for a day and\
  \ I was recovering from a jetlag and I stretched out my legs and pointed them towards\
  \ the Buddha statue, without even thinking about it. As I walked out of the temple,\
  \ I saw the signs that said: \"Don't point your feet at the Buddha\" it is known\
  \ to be very impolite in Thai culture, and I had completely forgotten about it.\
  \ I felt so bad about it and the fatigue really kicked in at this moment, so I started\
  \ crying. My friend tried to calm me down and she took me to sit inside the temple\
  \ garden. \nSuddenly my friend looks up and says: \"Oh, don't worry, she's fine\"\
  \ to the person standing behind me. I look up and I see a monk, with a very concerned\
  \ look in his eyes. I told him about what happened and he said to me: \"don't worry,\
  \ we all make mistakes. Now at least you know you'll never do it again.\"\nI smiled\
  \ and introduced myself to him: \"hi, I'm Cat, I want to be an English teacher here.\"\
  \n\"Oh, I want to learn more English!\" he said.\n\"Well, maybe I can teach you,\
  \ and you can teach me Thai.\"\n\"Deal!\" he said.\nAnd so my beautiful friendship\
  \ with a monk had started. We met in the temple's garden every weekend and taught\
  \ each other our languages. We discussed culture, religion and meditation and we\
  \ just talked about every day life.\nI lived in Thailand for 2 years and he has\
  \ remained one of my closest friends, that I'm sure I'll see again."
