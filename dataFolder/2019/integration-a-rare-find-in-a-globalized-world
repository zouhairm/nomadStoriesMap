Text: "When you see latin american culture you find it hard to disconnect it from\
  \ europe, as a latin american I have find it strange how we have diversified from\
  \ spain throughout the years. I lived in Brazil for a while and in it's case it\
  \ is somehow special and different from what I could have expected, they have a\
  \ multicultural tradition rooted in their language, cuisine and lifestyle. In this\
  \ strange country there are blue eyed yellow haired vikings coexisting and sharing\
  \ a culture with dark skinned curly haired dancers, lots of people from asian descent\
  \ and indigenous people who have still to connect and share their view of the world.\
  \ You have all this people living at this country under one flag and language, you\
  \ cannot avoid to ask yourself how did this come to be? How this country emerged\
  \ and built itself in a different manner than other countries in south america,\
  \ you see how the coexist and share a multicultural tradition from which the whole\
  \ world could learn a bit. I wonder how where the first explorers that arrived at\
  \ this strange country and why did it evolved in such way, but specially how do\
  \ they manage to complement and mix different views and beliefs. I don't presume\
  \ to say that they have it all figured it out, but this is a special case that could\
  \ only be compared to India, they do have issues, but they have managed to maintain\
  \ a national unity and their own diversity. I think it's intriguing and funny how\
  \ history in this ironic twist might reveal an answer for europe's issues in one\
  \ country which was a former colony of one of it's not so glorious members at this\
  \ time period. I'd say there is something special about Brazil, how they recieve\
  \ newcomers, how they enjoy life and give the world a different perspective, how\
  \ they have people believed to be some of the most attractive of the world after\
  \ all this genepool mix, some of the best athletes of the world even though they\
  \ may come from humble origins they manage to become some of the greatest in history.\
  \ \nI lived in Brazil for over a year and traveled there with friends after, even\
  \ though I could barely speak portuguese back then it was one of the best experiences\
  \ of my life, and it openes my eyes to true empathy towards others. Getting to know\
  \ someone else's reality is a difficult task, my favorite example is a word that\
  \ only exist in brazilian portuguese: \"Saudage\" kind of means to miss someone,\
  \ but it's truly an untranslatable word that has african roots... in other words\
  \ to understand its meaning you must get the feeling and then try to find the closest\
  \ translation in your own experience. This is the process in which you get to understand\
  \ someone else's feelings, situation and culture without making so many assumptions,\
  \ trying to change it with your own beliefs or believing it to be the same as your\
  \ own. This example on itself changed my way to view the world when I was only trying\
  \ to understand what someone was saying or when I was trying to buy something, ask\
  \ for my needs or just trying to get my message through. This is the kind of experience\
  \ that changes people and brings a new view, the multicultural and globalized view\
  \ in a profound and respectful manner. In order to change the world and make it\
  \ a better and just, we have to change ourselves, share experiences with others\
  \ and discover what each one can bring to the table, for we don't know what may\
  \ come after as a result and just that might be the spark for answering the questions\
  \ of old, finding solutions for unsolvable matters, and for a better world for the\
  \ generations to come."
