Text: "I was eighteen. I was eighteen and confused when I arrived in One Miles Beach,\
  \ New South Wales , Australia. I\u2019m seating in the back of a pick-up truck,\
  \ filled with pots of paint. The pick-up belongs to my uncle, he is a painter. A\
  \ house painter. He left Europe more than twenty years prior of my arrival in Australia\
  \ , leaving far behind the life of a \u201Dhomme d\u2019affaires \u201C he was holding\
  \ on for so many years. We stop at a crossroad. A long creature is lying down on\
  \ the road, right by the car. I observe the animal with a ferocious curiosity.\u201D\
  \ It\u2019s a Kangaroo\u201D says my uncle. \u201CHe\u2019s dead ? \u201C I ask,\
  \ \u201C oh yes, you will get used to see them, we\u2019ll make you try Kangaroo\
  \ meat if you like!\u201D. So perturbed by this first encounter with an animal I\
  \ dreamed all my childhood, I nod faintly. As we arrive at my uncle\u2019s house,\
  \ I can\u2019t help but picturing him, arriving in this land, and building the house\
  \ of his dream. \u201C I built it from scratch \u201C my uncle said, as I\u2019\
  m gazing at this home encercled by so many magestics trees. It\u2019s winter in\
  \ Australia, but it feels like an European spring. A few hours later, my uncle quickly\
  \ sets a bond fire in front of the living room\u2019s large windows, facing the\
  \ sea. Gathered around the fire, my uncle, my aunt and I, are burning marshmallows\
  \ on a stick. My uncle tells me that tomorrow we will build a bridge. \u201C A bridge!\u201D\
  \ I say, picturing us building a viaduct on top of an immense canyon. \u201C I found\
  \ a shipwreck on the beach this morning , we will desmantle it and use the wood\
  \ to build a bridge over the current in front of the house \u201C my uncle says.\
  \ I grew up in the countryside but I never felt more like a city boy than during\
  \ this bondfire talk. Exhilarated by these upcoming adventures, and the time-difference,\
  \ I decide to bravery wake up early in the morning. As I\u2019m walking outside\
  \ attempting to see the sun rise, I see my uncle already up and waiting for me a\
  \ the truck. \u201CLet\u2019s go? He says. The shipwreck ressembles more of a wood\
  \ raft that Robinson would have build, than an actual boat. My uncle starts the\
  \ chainsaw and starts cutting the boat in pieces. \u201CHere\u201D says my uncle\
  \ while he places a huge piece of wood on the back of my shoulders. \u201C you know\
  \ where the truck is\u201D laughs my uncle observing me struggling with this monstrous\
  \ piece of wood on my skinny body . To reach the truck, I needed to go trough a\
  \ small area of Forrest , which  overlooks the sea. As I\u2019m walking through\
  \ this opaque wilderness , I hear a loud laugh. Stupefy , I look around me, nothing\
  \ but agressive trees and bushes. Confused, I start walking again, and the loud\
  \ guffaw strikes again , but this time , it doesn\u2019t stop. It\u2019s one, two,\
  \ three, four persons laughing in the same time, but I can\u2019t see anybody .\
  \ Fearful, I drop the piece of wood and starts walking back,  but now I can distinguish\
  \ one of the laughs , I recognize my uncle\u2019s voice. Here he is, a few steps\
  \ behind me, looking at me with the funniest look. \u201C Look up\u201D my uncle\
  \ says, and here I see , a tree full of parrots, laughing out loud and holding themselves\
  \ upside down on the branches. \u201CThey are clowns\u201D my uncle says, \u201C\
  I call them laughing parrots \u201C says my uncle as he picks up both of our blocks\
  \ of wood and starts walking toward the truck ."
