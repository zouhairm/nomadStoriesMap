Text: "We boarded the 7:15am high speed Italiarail train from Santa Maria Novella\
  \ station in Florence to Venice.  In two hours we will arrive at our destination.\
  \  I was giddy, and excited as a school child on its first field trip.  Visiting\
  \ Venice was a dream that was finally coming true.  The train sped through the country\
  \ side and my anticipation grew.  Finally, we reach the Venice Maestre station,\
  \ the last stop before crossing over the lagoon into Santa Lucia station, Venice.\
  \  Soon, I get my first glimpse of Venice in the distance.  I pull out my IPhone\
  \ to record our arrival.   We gathered our belongings and follow the crowd of commuters\
  \ and other tourists out to the station.  My heart was pounding with excitement.\
  \  We stepped out of the station, I am in a daze, speechless.  No History book,\
  \ pictures, paintings or anything else I had previously seen on Venice, prepared\
  \ me for what laid before me.  I stood there for a few minutes, gasping, absorbing\
  \ the energy.  I try to get my barrings, and we board the vaporeto that will take\
  \ us to our hotel.  The vaporeto was brimming with people all speaking different\
  \ languages, all with that excitement that we only experience when traveling to\
  \ unknown places.  We made our way through the grand canal, and I could not contain\
  \ my tears, I thanked the universe for bringing me here, to this marvel.  I wanted\
  \ to hug it, caress it, tell it that I was in awe of its magesty.  I had finally\
  \ made it, and I could hardly absorb all I saw, the buildings, Palazzo\u2019s, architecture,\
  \ the colors, the water taxis, the barges,  conversation taking place on passing\
  \ boats, the gondolas, etc.  The vaporeto let us out at The Academia station.  There\
  \ was a drizzle and a light fog over the pond.  The weather, added to the atmospheric\
  \ mysterious mood that Venice exudes.  We quickly got ourselves lost, but were able\
  \ to redirect ourselves and were quickly on route to our hotel.  I had booked a\
  \ room at Hotel Palazzo Nani Mocenigo.  The boutique hotel, a newly restored property\
  \ in a Gothic Venetian 15th century Palazzo, is located just off the grand canal.\
  \  After checking in, we were escorted to our beautifully appointed room.  Our room\
  \ elegantly decorated, with upholstered walls in rich chocolate, silk damask and\
  \ Murano glass sconces felt like a beautiful gift box.  A sumptuous bed was laid\
  \ out with thick, cotton robes and slippers.  The spacious bathroom was done in\
  \ white marble with elegant toiletries that smelled of fresh lemon grove.  There\
  \ was the much convenient coffee station and snackbar in our room.  The room looked\
  \ out to the courtyard and gardens.  The hotel is a perfect mixture of old Venice\
  \ with modern touches and attention to smallest details.  A wonderful, friendly\
  \ and gracious staff saw to our needs and organized a private tour of a Murano glass\
  \ studio. \n\nWe spent our days wandering the alleys, getting lost and discovering,\
  \ eating but mostly walking hand in hand in silence, along the canals and just marveling\
  \ at this incredible experience and the beauty of \u201CLa Serenissima\u201D.\n\n\
