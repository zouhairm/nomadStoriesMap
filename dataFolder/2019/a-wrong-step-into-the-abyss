Text: "Tall palm trees provided the shelter I yearned for as beads of sweat kept drifting\
  \ down my forehead. Swallowed up by the dense forest, the muffled song of the Lesser\
  \ Frigate bird echoed. Looking up I saw the sun peeking between the branches and\
  \ I could tell it was almost noon.\n\nEvery now and then a motorbike would climb\
  \ up the steep hill carrying children and their amused laughter would break the\
  \ silence. Pits and bumps along the dirt road made a wonderful obstacle course even\
  \ for people walking, like me.\n\nI looked down at the map on my phone Not for long\
  \ now-  I thought - Straight ahead for one kilometre. The path suddenly changed\
  \ into a dirt track site, no one in sight except for a few goats and dogs. Plastic\
  \ basins scattered around the floor and clothes on racks were the only reminiscence\
  \ of human life. I picked up the pace and moved forward. \n\nThe map stubbornly\
  \ showed a turn to the left where there was no path to follow.\n\n\u201CAre you\
  \ okay?\u201D, someone said in a thick French accent.\n\nI turned around and found\
  \ a man dressed in khaki shorts and open sandals and carrying a backpack. The porcelain\
  \ skin tone gave the impression that he had just arrived. I smiled back at him:\n\
  \n\u201CHello! Yes, thanks. I want to find a viewpoint nearby but my map is not\
  \ being a great help.\u201D, I answered. Having realized that we were headed in\
  \ different directions, we exchanged pleasantries and parted ways.\n\nMy destination\
  \ was just 10 minutes away and I needed to get there soon or I would miss my boat\
  \ back to Ao Nang.\n\nStruggling through dense spiky bushes, invisible spider webs\
  \ and hearing crawling noises in the fallen leaves, I had to return for my flip\
  \ flop repeatedly. Another branch dodged and there it was in the distance: clear\
  \ blue sky, a fine line drawn by a mountain covered in green tapestry, coming down\
  \ to a narrow strip of land surrounded by sand on one side and long tail boats on\
  \ the other. In the middle, some buildings hid the hustle of tourists making their\
  \ last minute shopping of goods made in China.\n\nThis view deserves a picture,\
  \  I thought.\n\nI set the timer and jumped from the rock I was on to the ground\
  \ underneath.\n\nThe ground was far from a consistent clay texture dirt. My feet\
  \ had landed on branches and leaves and had sunken. I looked up at the rock from\
  \ where I had jumped and it looked bigger and further from my reach.\n\n\"Beep,\
  \ Beep...\"\n\nI hurried up the other rock in front just before the timer was off.\n\
  \n\u201CClick.\u201D\n\nI approached the bigger rock again and it felt smooth and\
  \ slippery beneath my fingers. I struggled to get a grip somewhere on the surface\
  \ as I knew the ground was slowly collapsing under my weight.\n\nA mist of frozen\
  \ air washed over my brain and I started panting. I couldn\u2019t hear the heavy\
  \ breathing as my mind\u2019s focus was set on finding a plan to get myself out\
  \ of there. I could feel I was gasping for air.\n\nIt suddenly dawned on me that\
  \ there was nobody in sight who could help and even if I screamed nobody would know\
  \ where I was. I was trapped somewhere in a forest on Phi Phi Don.\n\n\"You can\
  \ make it!\", I blurted repeatedly out loud as a boost to myself. Drips of cold\
  \ sweat diving down my spine as my body began to shake.\n\nI stretched my left leg\
  \ as far up as possible and stood precariously on my tiptoes. My right arm sat on\
  \ my elbow and began a lifting motion.\nThis is not working, I thought.\n\nAnother\
  \ impatient attempt. My leg began to slip. I pushed my knee harder against the surface\
  \ until I felt the skin burning and melting. My teeth clenched as I tried to lift\
  \ the rest of my body.\n\nMy right elbow was stretched and its skin was shaved off.\
  \ As soon as my body was lifted I rolled over to the side and got up.\n\nIt was\
  \ nearly time to board the boat."
