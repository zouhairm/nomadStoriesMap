Text: "After three months of hard work in a restaurant, we were ready to leave Punta\
  \ Del Este. As always, uncertainty was our friend, the cosmic rhythm of the travel\
  \ left us in some point in the route. The time was slow, the sun just up of our\
  \ heads, letting us know that we had to be somewhere at 20:00, just when the sun\
  \ goes down. Anxiety came; we had heard that there in Uruguay people use to hitchhike,\
  \ a totally unknown practice in Colombia. So we were waiting,  talking about life\
  \ and how we were so far away from home bringing to reality one of the dreams of\
  \ our childhood. \n\nSuddenly our first experience came in the shape of a white\
  \ old van, Danny was its driver, an Argentinian musician that wanted to rest alone\
  \ in the extraordinary landscapes of Uruguay, his goal was Punta del Diablo, a little\
  \ town of fishermen in the boundary of brazil.  \u201CIt is my first time,\u201D\
  \ he said. Then, we experienced together the solidarity of a shared dream, travelling.\
  \ He looked tired. The drive was hard from BsAs to that point; nevertheless, he\
  \ smiled every time we speak about how different were our cultures even though we\
  \ share the same beautiful language. He talked about his band and how is like to\
  \ be a man that live with music. The story was spinning alone, we only heard it.\
  \ \n\nEverything was good, the warm \"mate\", the music and the landscapes, but\
  \ after two hours of journey, the van stopped and we had to move. Our backpacks\
  \ was our home, almost 13 kg of dreams were meticulously packed, and despite of\
  \ that we decide to walk until another dreamer picked up us. After a few minutes,\
  \ another old car appeared, a Mercedes benz stopped just after our signal . There\
  \ were two man, and old peasant and a person who seemed to be a traveller like us,\
  \ don Carlos y Agust\xEDn. The first minutes were the longest, we speculated about\
  \ their lives and how the absolute azar that was behind the encounter. Don Carlos\
  \ said that he had been in Colombia a few months ago. He was amazed about the mountains,\
  \ strange for him in his flat country.  At the end, he left us in the route again,\
  \ but a little bit closer of our destiny. Just before leaving, he opened the window\
  \  and said \u201Cwhen you arrive there, ask for Carlos Mozo in the police station,\
  \ they will tell you the indications to my Hostel, I will let you stay the night\
  \ just for $180 Uruguayan pesos, you Colombians were too good with me\u201D. We\
  \ thought about how lucky we were, Uruguay is not a cheap country, a beer cost 120,\
  \ a good deal. \n\nNow, we were three dreamers, Agust\xEDn, Javi and I, walking\
  \ to the north again, there was 2 hour left before the sun goes down. We keep walking,\
  \ praying that someone want to travel with three strangers. Agustin was a cook like\
  \ javi, they talked a lot about that, I just observed them and took pictures. Fortunately\
  \ for us, lucky was there again. A huge truck stopped, then we were leaning on the\
  \ top, receiving the wind and the latest sunbeams on our faces. \n\nThe day was\
  \ dying and we arrived just on time. The sun was setting behind us. We asked for\
  \ the beach. We were sweating and tired, but before ask about Don Carlos hostel,\
  \ we wanted to feel the sand in our foot and swim in the cold water of the ocean.\
  \ The sound of our backpacks in the sand was dried. Our shoulders were destroyed\
  \ but our souls full. We decided who goes first to swim, Javi won. I saw how the\
  \ colours in the horizon were changing in the east. Then the most beautiful thing\
  \ I\xB4ve ever seen. Something started to climb above the ocean. White, brilliant\
  \ and beautiful was the biggest moon in my life, I was amazed, and for two single\
  \ minutes I felt alive. All the pain in my body disappeared, I cried like a child\
  \ while Javi was in the ocean shouting me, juaaaaan look at the moon!!!. The first\
  \ moon."
