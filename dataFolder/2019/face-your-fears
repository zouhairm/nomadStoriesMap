Text: "Three years ago, I was lying on the bed thinking about my desire for traveling\
  \ to apply for the faculty I want, which is located in another city far from mine,\
  \ I still remember my fears of traveling; can I adapt with strange people similar\
  \ not to me in customs, thoughts, or even accent? Can I endure living apart from\
  \ my family? Who will take care of me when I feel sick? And my decisions, it will\
  \ depend on me without sharing it with others. Nevertheless; I cannot hide my desire\
  \ to gain this experience and travel testing myself. I used to read about travelers\
  \ and explorers, books talking about journeys, and fictional adventure stories;\
  \ all of these inspired me to travel and experience true pleasure instead of reading\
  \ it. I admit I felt fear of the unknown, traveling alone to a city I did not know\
  \ anything about, but my urge to experience another kind of excitement and to live\
  \ and see what explorers wrote in their works was bigger than my fears. During my\
  \ troubled thoughts, I remembered my mission to convince my father on permitting\
  \ me to travel.\nYou may wonder: \"is your father's opinion a problem for you?\"\
  \ Regarding my family, it is not familiar to let your daughter travel alone all\
  \ of this distance and my father did totally agree with that. Thanks to my insistence\
  \ on traveling and my urge to experience true pleasure, my father agreed to let\
  \ me travel. It was my biggest battle for me and I won.\nLet me start with the feeling\
  \ of happiness in a day when I started to prepare my luggage, it was like I was\
  \ building my small house in my hands, and booking my ticket, it was like I had\
  \ touchable insurance in my hands for my delight. In this day, I had combined sentiments\
  \ of excitement and confusion from the unknown.  I was ready to start my journey\
  \ and leap into the unknown, though.\nI discovered that time spent in the bus to\
  \ arrive at my destination was the perfect time to give space for myself and clear\
  \ my mind like yoga or better for me because I was so lucky that my destination\
  \ passed through breathtaking landscapes. I did not feel the bus was moving, I felt\
  \ instead that the plants were dancing and logs were running while leaves were speaking.\
  \ All of these movements always reminded me with my best memories and imagining\
  \ I achieve my dreams in the future. Is there better feeling than that?\nAll my\
  \ fears of traveling dispelled. I never imagined I could have close friend from\
  \ various cities. I enjoyed talking with them sharing our customs and differences.\
  \ I meet many persons with different personalities and I learnt how to deal with\
  \ them. Traveling made me know my new qualities in my personality I would not imagine\
  \ I had. I discovered I am able to face the problems alone and make quick decisions\
  \ in some situations required, I learnt how to take care of me without depending\
  \ on my family, take the responsibility and I learnt to be free. I eventually grew\
  \ up. \nI found another life in traveling and finally experienced a little of joy\
  \ that I used to read in books about traveling by explorers. Traveling fueled my\
  \ spirit, built my personality, opened my mind and taught me many lessons of life.\
  \ And I never thought I would find all of these fun and delight from thing I was\
  \ afraid of just thinking about. All what I did that I faced my fears either traveling\
  \ alone or convincing my father. I discovered all of these just by traveling from\
  \ my city to another, what about the whole world?"
