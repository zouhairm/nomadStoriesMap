Text: "I decided to take the trip to \u2018find myself\u2019.  After the traumatic\
  \ experiences of the past few years I needed some time alone.  I needed rest, recuperation\
  \ and time to think.  Which is how I found myself in Chiang Mai, a city in a mountainous\
  \ area in northern Thailand, a long way from my home in Sydney, Australia.\nThis\
  \ wasn\u2019t the first stop on my trip, I\u2019d already explored other areas of\
  \ Thailand, staying everywhere from fancy resorts to dusty and drab hotels.  I had\
  \ spent a week on a spectacular secluded island getting massages, body scrubs, indulging\
  \ in fresh, delicious foods.  But I still didn\u2019t feel any better.  I was lost.\n\
  Since arriving in Chiang Mai, an ancient but vibrant city of over 131,000 people,\
  \ where remnants of the past collide and mesh seamlessly with the modern world,\
  \ I had continued exploring, tasting and experiencing, trying to find myself.\n\
  After visiting several of the beautiful, ancient temples, adorned with the most\
  \ intricate of details, winding my way through countless market stalls and selecting\
  \ antiques and local handmade items, I was ready to venture further and head to\
  \ Kuet Chang in the Mae Taeng District of the Chiang Mai province.\nWith less than\
  \ 6000 people living in Kuet Chang, A tambon made up of 8 villages, it was a far\
  \ cry from the hustle and bustle of Chiang Mai \u2013 although being the location\
  \ of the Happy Elephant Home, a must-see place for me.\nWith social media constantly\
  \ abuzz with tales of cruelty towards elephants in Thailand, I wanted to spend some\
  \ time in an elephant sanctuary, where these beautiful giants were loved and cared\
  \ for following their rescue.  After careful research I decided that Happy Elephant\
  \ Home sounded perfect.\nTravelling on a bus towards Kuet Chang I was pleased to\
  \ see the number of people coming along to care for the rescued elephants.  As I\
  \ stared out the window watching the change of scenery from city to smaller villages\
  \ and then to jungle, I couldn\u2019t help but feel excited.\nShortly before arriving,\
  \ the driver announced there was one stop before arriving at the Happy Elephant\
  \ Home.  When we pulled in, the bus emptied\u2026leaving only me on board. \nI still\
  \ hadn\u2019t quite shaken off the shock when I finally arrived at my destination.\
  \  I was the sole visitor that day.\nShortly after arriving I changed into a colourful,\
  \ traditional Mahout uniform.  Following this my guide who worked as a Mahout, or\
  \ elephant keeper, explained that I would work with her for the day.  I was to prepare\
  \ food for the elephants, feed them, play with them, bathe them in the river and\
  \ shower them with love.\nWith a bag full of bananas, I made my way over to the\
  \ elephants where I heard the stories of their past.  Looking into their eyes I\
  \ felt a strange recognition.\nI spoke softly to the gentle giants who had been\
  \ so mistreated, while holding out bananas for them.  While it took a little time,\
  \ and the babies trusted me fastest, eventually the big girls were pushing their\
  \ trunks into my bag searching for food.  \nThat day I played with the elephants\
  \ in a mud bath on top of a mountain, before walking down it bare foot with thick\
  \ mud oozing between my toes and continued barefoot through the jungle.\nAt times\
  \ I felt scared as I walked along narrow tracks and looked down at the long drop\
  \ beside me, but I held on to the elephant\u2019s trunks and kept going, all the\
  \ while feeding them until I came to the river.\nOnce there, the elephants walked\
  \ into the water and flopped onto their sides, letting the coolness wash away the\
  \ mud.  As I stood in the water washing them, I looked across to the other side\
  \ of the river to a different elephant \u2018sanctuary\u2019 where people were riding\
  \ elephants and I knew I was in the right place.\nLooking into the eyes of the giant\
  \ but gentle elephants, understanding the suffering and torment they had been through\
  \ and seeing their willingness to trust again, I felt a part of me begin to shift.\
  \  As though part of that hole was starting to fill again."
