Text: "The hairs on my arms began to stand in excitement as the native man took us\
  \ past the flowing river the security men at the gate of the Secondary school had\
  \ told him to stop at. They had conversed in a \u2018bgbagi\u2019 native language\
  \ and all I could understand was one of the security man\u2019s gesticulation of\
  \ a flowing stream. He stopped for a second time, and this time he conversed in\
  \ Hausa language with a man who was with his wife. They seemed Fulani to me because\
  \ of the markings on their faces. He had asked  for direction about a group of hikers\
  \ who had passed by not too long ago. Soon his motorcycle came to a stop. Not by\
  \ the shinning mass of dusty golden sand but by the efforts of our transporter who\
  \ now explained in \u2018pidgin\u2019 English that we should follow the foot prints\
  \ and we would soon caught-up with adventurers like our self or soon behold the\
  \ waterfalls in the mountains before us.\nNature had long beckoned on me for this\
  \ wonderland in Karishi not far from my suburban neighborhood. Karishi felt like\
  \ the sights of nature I had always seen in movies or I had read in books. It was\
  \ like the mountain regions of Europe, the countrysides of the United States and\
  \ the rainforests of South America all encompassed as one. The curbs of the guinea\
  \ corn plantation at the foot of the mountain were looking healthy and strong. Nature\
  \ had sure taken care of its own. The cows here would surely have plenty to eat\
  \ and the village settlement here was in all the real sense an Eco-village. Everything\
  \ was made from nature and maintained by nature. The huts were made from nature\
  \ and recycled back to nature. \nThe floor of the pathway was etched with finely\
  \ carved and polished precious stones mixed with shimmering sands and beautiful\
  \ flowers. The air here was clean and sweet. The mountains  kissed and hug each\
  \ other with every sight and made enough way for the wind to pass through. The trees\
  \ offered freely their shades and made sweet music when they chorused with the wind\
  \ and the waterfall flowing from a distance unknown. Although I couldn\u2019t look\
  \ into the eyes of the sun it burnt so bright and left a tingling sensation on my\
  \ dark skin as it made the waters and sands sparkle. The water smelt like fresh\
  \ herbs and like the early mornings would relive its moments here, again and again.\n\
  As I stepped through the marble rocks that nature had laid leading up to the top\
  \ as if there was a king on a throne and a glory to behold, I whistled out to the\
  \ gray and white monkey who had just drank from the waters flowing down in-between\
  \ the marble steps and had not given me a second glance. He hopped into the trees\
  \ in the bushes by the sides and swung into the distance far away for my eyes to\
  \ see. With each step I took, I would travel. I would be a writer, or an inventor\
  \ and most definitely an explorer. I would be a scientist, I would study the plants,\
  \ the animals and the hidden corridors yet unknown. If I could I would want to blow\
  \ with the winds so I can easily discover the nooks and cranny\u2019s of this magnificent\
  \ natural lands.\nI squeezed my slander body through the narrow gates of rocks tangled\
  \ with giant tree roots. All I could hear was the gushing sound of the waterfalls\
  \ as I held tightly to the roots. Nature was drumming and my heart was pounding.\
  \ With each pull and climb up through the narrow path, I thought of my homeland,\
  \ I thought of the Niger Delta, I thought of my country and the endless beauty unperturbed\
  \ that abound. \nFinally I was here; in my mind and with my body. With nature, in\
  \ harmony and underneath the waterfall I had come to see."
