Text: "As we stepped out of South Africa into a neighbouring yet distant previously\
  \ Portuguese ruled Mozambique, the skies had their own story to tell which had peace\
  \ written all over them. People were friendly and ready to lead us into the world\
  \ of exploration. Everybody was busy in many different languages trying to reach\
  \ out and welcome their country's visitors. All I heard was \"Bem Vindo\" \"Welcome\"\
  \ and \"Sawubona\", the rest was just translated into love as I watched these local\
  \ people mumbling with smiles and respect.\n\nWe were the  lead to our hotel \"\
  \ Hotel Cardosso\" in a very busy yet welcoming city of Maputo with a lot of government\
  \ buildings on one side and busy roads. All the hotels; lodges and inns were full\
  \ of chilled foreigners which kept me looking forward to explore the place and gave\
  \ me more interest to find out what could have attracted these tourists from all\
  \ over the world. \n\nAt hotel Cardosso, the hospitality and respect could fill\
  \ a 10 ton truck if were to be measured in volume. Their seafood was out of this\
  \ world. Who goes to Mozambique and not dig in on the fresh biggest king prawns\
  \ and lobster, fresh from the warm Indian Ocean? Foodporn was mastered, the art\
  \ had started from the fisherman,the chef did a perfect job of preparing and the\
  \ amazing finishes to their very huge plates that I ended up wanting to leak. \n\
  \nOh yes this was the country where everybody and everything around wanted to make\
  \ us feel welcomed. As I would speak in English, they would say \"nao comprehendo\"\
  \ in a subtle way that I ended up understing them. They were very popular and one\
  \ of the best for weaves then that I was sold and had my hair weaved. We woke up\
  \ the following morning and went for breakfast in a pool club, that's how it's called.\
  \ While we were sitting there waiting for our scrumptious breakfast(the smell was\
  \ a killer), some people were swimming while waiting for their food. Oh wow what\
  \ a breath taker. Their city life was superb.\n\nA big part of us wanted to see\
  \ their tropical side of things from the word go. A day after we were off to Inhaca\
  \ island in a boat that took about two hours to get there. The boat was so full\
  \ as everybody was probably dying to be in an island and to experience the beauty\
  \ along the gorgeous palm trees. Inside the boat as it was scorching hot, they had\
  \ their best cold local beer which is still my favorite M2. Ohhhhh what a malt!\
  \ We finally got to the island and everything changed for the best. They were normal\
  \ lodges but we wanted the raw-ness of the island, a touch of originality of the\
  \ place so we booked at home-turned to lodges by local residents which was not fancy\
  \ but it was worth every cent. It was closer to a bee hive, we walked through dunes\
  \ of sand to get to beach so the exercise part was taken care of. Every morning,\
  \ we went to the beach and picked our breakfast from local fishermen, took it to\
  \ the restaurant by the sand and they would prepare it for us. Everything was just\
  \ so tropical, swimming was the order of the day. \n\nI would go there again anytime\
  \ and recommend everybody to go there for the best tropical experience and hospitality"
