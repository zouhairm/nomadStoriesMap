  \ visiting Prague includes; the naturally blooming flowers that beautify the city\
  \ in Spring. The streets, parks and garden are nicely decorated with flowers that\
  \ gives a cozy atmosphere which makes one wants to go out for sightseeing. In the\
  \ long run, people visit nearby parks at this time of the year for various activities\
  \ such as watching the fountain, reading a book, walking a dog, exercising, going\
  \ for a short walk with loved ones or just out to enjoy the weather.\n\nAnother\
  \ thing a tourist can find interesting is Czech traditional cuisine. The most introduced\
  \ one is \"Knedlicky ve Brambory\", known in English as Czech dumplings. This special\
  \ meal is made with meat sauce and dumplings which can be taken with a glass of\
  \ beer or a red/white wine.\n\nThe Czech Republic is famous for having many breweries\
  \ \" Pivovar\" in Czech. However, most breweries are found in the sub-urban regions\
  \ of the country. Tourists are amazed on how a bottle of beer could be cheaper than\
  \ a bottle of water, yet citizens drink responsibly. A beer in Czech is called \"\
  Pivo\" and some famous brands are; Pilsner Urquell, Staropramen, Kozel and many\
  \ more.\nThe Charles bridge, astronomical clock and the Prague castle are definitely\
  \ places one should visit during his/her stay in Prague. \n\nThe night life in Prague\
  \ is amazing, this is because there are lots of activities one can engage in such\
  \ as clubbing, seeing a movie at the cinema, joining friends for karaoke. And the\
  \ fact that there are convenient transportation system that keeps the trams, metros,\
  \ buses and taxies running even till late hours at night. \n\nThe locals are friendly\
  \ to tourists, most especially when they try to say something to them in Czech.\
  \ For example, having a conversation like; \"Dobry den\" Good day in English, \"\
  Dejkuju\" Thank You, \"Nashkladano\" Good bye.\n\nIn conclusion, it's advisable\
  \ to be a registered member of expat.cz; an English website in Czech Republic that\
  \ helps one get the most of happening events in the city as well as other activities.\
  \ The exchange rate of other European currency to Czech Kroner is favourable to\
  \ tourists in possession of such, as a result, residents of many neighbouring countries\
