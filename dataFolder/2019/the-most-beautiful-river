Text: "\u201CThe Tagus river is prettier than the river that passes through my village,\
  \ but the Tagus is not prettier than the river that passes through my village because\
  \ the Tagus is not the the river that passes through my village\u201D.\n\nA verse\
  \ by  Alberto Caiero.\n\n A nice opening of one of the most beautiful Portuguese\
  \ poems.  \n\nIt was hard for me to decipher what the poet means at my first reading\
  \ long time ago. Moreover the poet\u2019s real name was Fernando Pessoa who wrote\
  \ as well under the heteronyms Ricardo Reis and Alvaro de Campos. A weird story\
  \ and this river\u2026\n\nIf you fly from whenever into Lisbon, the Portuguese capital\
  \ and the center of the one of the vastest empire in the human history, the plane\
  \ always goes in a south direction, then flies over the pristine cliffs and forests\
  \ of Serra de Arrabida and over the 20 mile long Costa Da Caparica sand beaches,\
  \ as if to show you what is awaiting you in and around Lisbon.\n\nAnd then it comes\
  \ \u2026.the Tagus River! Magnificent, alluring, mingling with the Atlantic ocean!\
  \ The winds are almost always strong and the aircraft plunges over this twinkling\
  \ water, hovering above the 25th of April Bridge (a mere copy of the Golden Gate\
  \ bridge in San Francisco, USA) and the statue of Christ the King (a  mere copy\
  \ of the famous statue in Rio de Janeiro, Brasil).\n\nSince my first visit in Lisbon\
  \ I have learned my lesson - it is the river that is important! The Tagus was always\
  \ and is vital for Lisbon and Portugal. It was from this river that the caravels\
  \ of the great maritime explorers sailed in the 15th and the 16th century. It was\
  \ from here that one of the greatest earthquakes ever to happen, hit the city and\
  \ the whole of the Iberian peninsula, causing thousand of  deaths, floods, fires\
  \ on that All Saints' Day in 1755. It was from here that during the World War II\
  \ so many people find their exodus to the New World. It was from here that the Carnation\
  \ revolution  started in 1974. It was here that the Portuguese always had and still\
  \ have the hope to hail the coming of the New Emperor, the one who will bring peace\
  \ and prosperity in the world\u2026.\n\nI used to sail many times with my friend\
  \ Rui on a traditional wooden boat on the Tagus. Our first encounter was provoked\
  \ by the river - I wanted to cross it and asked him if he knows the fastest way\
  \ to do this.\n\n\u201CYes, I know\u201D, he replied and went on walking by the\
  \ riverfront, leaving me perplexed on the question, in a doubt if he was just rude\
  \ or mad. Than he turned, with a face still looking to the other side of the river\
  \ and said: \u201COk, come with me!\u201D. It is a Portuguese way of dealing with\
  \ life and rivers  - both of them flows permanently and it is not a good idea to\
  \ stop them if you do not have a good reason to do so!\n\nFor the years of my friendship\
  \ with Rui, The Tagus and Lisbon, I have seen the thousands faces of this gorgeous\
  \ river coming from Spain, passing through big part of Portugal and going into the\
  \ ocean right next to the Portuguese capital. This river gives lives, diverges people,\
  \ connects worlds, turns the water into straw-bale-like path, sails enormous cruise\
  \ ships, small fisherman boats, ferries, children toys\u2026.\n\nBelieve it or not\
  \ even crossing the 10 minutes stretch from Praca do Comercio, the main Lisbon square\
  \ to Cacilhas on the opposite bank - is like going to another country - everything\
  \  is so different.\n\nI can now open my eyes - I have no fear of The Tagus and\
  \ its winds anymore! \n\n\u201CFrom The Tagus you can go all over the world\u201D\
  , my mind reminds me again the verse of the poet.\n\nI want it all, I want to sail\
  \ it from its springs to the ocean, to be part of the its life and its people -\
  \ those who live besides and with it! \n\nCome, join me on this trip, the plane\
  \ is already landing in Lisbon and The Tagus is waiting!"
