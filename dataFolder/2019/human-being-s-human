Text: "For the umpteenth time in his life, he cursed his destiny for what he was about\
  \ to commit. Was there no other choice? The answer came immediately, loud and clear,\
  \ in the form of a couple retching he barely disguised. In the last three hours\
  \ he has been tormented by cramps. His body necessitated it\u2026 His mind craved\
  \ it. He wondered when he had reached the very bottom. \nIf only that frigid wind\
  \ was gelid enough to anesthetize his internal throe\u2026. He anchored his mind\
  \ on the whiteness and candour surrounding him, trying to blend his soul in with\
  \ the tons of snow blanketing the town and caressing its roofs \u2013 maybe it could\
  \ absorb some of his sins. Blasts of cold air kept gusting down from the mountains.\
  \ Abruptly, his father\u2019s face loomed in the blizzard. Stern eyes, the same\
  \ gaze he had that last time, whilst being dragged away.\u2026 Focus! He just needed\
  \ to focus. Dad wasn\u2019t there anymore, he wasn\u2019t anymore.\nThe stream of\
  \ life was rushing all around him, indifferent; inebriated with wine or with New\
  \ Year\u2019s Eve thrilling adrenaline.  The 2019 was expected to be the year of\
  \ the rebirth for the newly baptized Milan of Romania, proud of all its new-born\
  \ companies which has outsourced to fatten up the insatiable rapacity of the western\
  \ world with another land\u2019s lymph; Italy, worn out and parched, started to\
  \ become such demandingly fussy as a spoiled ex-wife.\nAnyway, none of this makes\
  \ any difference, where he comes from. Where he comes from, death is expiated by\
  \ living. Where he comes from, those who don\u2019t terrorise fall ill from terror.\n\
  It\u2019s time for action. Detached, a predator, heightened senses, his tenseness\
  \ barely betrayed by his heartbeat and the blood roaring in the ears. The black\
  \ wolfish eyes scanned the crowd looking for his pray\u2026and pierced her.\nShe\
  \ stood out from the crowd. It was evident she didn\u2019t belong to that place:\
  \ nobody in that fallen city had such sophisticated clothes, the light-heartedness\
  \ she oozed and, above all, that artless and unarmed look. Nobody wanders so unarmed,\
  \ here. A fish out of water. The perfect target.\nSpellbound, overwhelmed by the\
  \ market and its chattering pout-purr\xEC. Bewitched by the stalls, meandering around,\
  \ trailing the fragrances of local delicacies, unable to decide where to start from.\
  \ Ca\u0219caval, the countless variants of Ciorba, o a couple of sarmale? Anyway,\
  \ for what it is worth, she could have bought the whole stall, considering the price\
  \ difference between Italy and that place. \nSo far, she had been seduced by that\
  \ town, in spite, or maybe precisely because of, its myriad contradictions. Timi\u0219\
  oara has lordly immense squares, parlour worthy of the finest Austro-Hungarian nobility;\
  \ its grandiose palaces, mostly in the Art Nouveau style with few Baroque brushstrokes,\
  \ commanded respect. Nonetheless, they jarred with the recent urban sprawl, resulting\
  \ in innumerable suburban soviet blocks, an inconsolably ailing concrete jungle.\n\
  People were diffident. Not just diffident, actually; she would describe them as\
  \ totally ramshackle. \nShe could sense the intrinsic two-facedness of that city,\
  \ she could breathe it in the melancholy yet peaceful snowflakes falling silently.\
  \ Downtrodden by the vestiges of an ancient splendour, its every atom of was shaking,\
  \ as to forewarn her that nothing was what it seemed. \n \u201CHey, do you have\
  \ a lighter?\u201D - asked a pair of eyes popped out at the corner of her sight.\
  \ They were mournful dark eyes, having probably seen too much suburbia, recounting\
  \ what they hungered but never had. She didn\u2019t know his name, but immediately\
  \ grasped something bad had changed him. She sensed his soul was wounded, yet good.\
  \ He seemed vulnerable and lonely, and in desperate need to share.\n\u201COf course,\
  \ here you are!\u201D\nA couple of set phrases and he kept her in check. He fobbed\
  \ her off with the story of Adina, her hospitalised teen-age girlfriend. She accepted\
  \ to accompany him. Such a foolish reckless! American? No, she said she was\u2026\
  \ Italian! How the hell could a Mafia\u2019s cultural output be that gullible?\n\
  However, he had to admit the was something magnetic in her, in that gracious and\
  \ unpretentious gait, in that frank smile. She wasn\u2019t a breath-taking beauty,\
  \ still seductive."
