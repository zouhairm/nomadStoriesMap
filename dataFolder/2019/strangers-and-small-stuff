Text: "Boarding school at age six forced me to be extremely flexible. There\u2019\
  s never been time to sweat the small stuff. Forget your swimmers on the farm? Tough\
  \ luck, you\u2019re not swimming this week (this is a much bigger deal if you grew\
  \ up in Northern South Africa with 45 degree summers). As a result I\u2019m one\
  \ of the more easy going people I know. Don\u2019t you hate it when people say they\u2019\
  re easy going but they\u2019re really not? (Thanks every dating app I\u2019ve ever\
  \ tried.) Well, I really, really, am easy going. \n\nWhile traveling I\u2019ve survived:\
  \ broken down busses in Cambodia, running out of fuel in Zimbabwe, lost luggage\
  \ just days before a big wedding, elephants blocking roads, multiple flat tyres\
  \ (including half a dozen on gravel roads and 40+ degree heat), walking 3.5 km in\
  \ 90% humidity to avoid being overcharged by a taxi driver, countless visa applications,\
  \ sleeping at airports and running to my gate more times than I care to remember\
  \ (in an attempt to conquer my severe \u2018FOMO\u2019 I always leave just enough\
  \ time to get to the airport). \n\nAs a millennial I obviously feel entitled to\
  \ some award, prize, or trophy for surviving all of this. I also feel entitled to\
  \ at least a ribbon for never having missed a single flight (all that running to\
  \ gates and aggressively pushing my way through security sure paid off). \n\nToday,\
  \ however, was the closest I\u2019ve ever come to not boarding my flight in time.\
  \ \n\nAfter two incredible days of diving with my sister in the Great Barrier Reef,\
  \ Cyclone Nora brought us rain. Lots and lots of rain. Apparently in Tropical North\
  \ Australia rain equals fallen down trees, flooding, and a closed highway. Suddenly\
  \ the 27km between the Great Barrier Reef and the airport in two hours seemed impossible.\
  \ As a true optimist I checked Google Maps and walking would\u2019ve taken five\
  \ hours. New tickets at $400 was not an option and a missed flight would also mean\
  \ not traveling to New Zealand for the next part of our trip.\n\nLuckily problem\
  \ solving is in my skillset, so here\u2019s what we did: we ran to the highway 20kg\
  \ bags in tow (1km has never felt so far), flagged down a stranger heading in the\
  \ direction of the airport, hit up an Uber driver and told him to wait on the other\
  \ side of the closed highway (he was totally on board with this), jumped over roadblocks,\
  \ changed cars, raced to the airport and pulled down the plane Fast & Furious style.\
  \ Ok that last part didn\u2019t happen. The flight was miraculously delayed by 40\
  \ minutes. Phew. We made it with enough time to grab a coffee. \n\nIn the words\
  \ of my very wise little sister: \u201Cfunny how seemingly important things become\
  \ so unimportant in times of crisis. Now turn on your mobile hotspot so I can access\
  \ the internet.\u201D Millennials indeed. \n\nDon\u2019t sweat the small stuff.\
  \ We never have, why start now?"
