Text: "When I was young, I idolized this country. Cartoon stories like Sailormoon,\
  \ Doraemon, and Candy-candy were colored my childhood. Eventhough I am grown up\
  \ now, I still love anime. Almost all anime tells a little bit about Japan and this\
  \ makes me want to travel to Japan, since anime promotes Japan very well.\nI was\
  \ born to a simple family in Indonesia. Our monitary currency and economic condition\
  \ in Indonesia is not strong, so for me, travelling to Japan seems a little bit\
  \ expensive. Additionally, tour service to Japan is extraordinarily expensive. However\
  \ my determination keeps me going. With a very limited budget, I flew to see Japan,\
  \ I didn't use a tour service, I backpacked as an Indonesian say \"travelling with\
  \ gut & brain\"\nThe first time I searched in Tokyo is Japan's subway map. When\
  \ I read Japan's subway map, it gave me a headache, I thought people needed a special\
  \ skill to understand that route. The subway map is not as simple as any country\
  \ that I ever visited like Singapore, Hong Kong and China. And that made me realize\
  \ that I depand on the people of Japan so much, in case I got lost.\nThe first time\
  \ I saw japanese people, they looked so stiff, they didn't have a smile on their\
  \ face, and they look just like a typical serious person. But don't let their appearance\
  \ fool you, Japanese people are the most welcome people and helpful people. Everytime\
  \ I felt confuse and got lost in a teritory, I asked the local people to ask and\
  \ they helped me spontaneously in reading a map and showed the road. They even guided\
  \ me to the place several times. Eventhough they look stiff, once we asked them,\
  \ they suddenly smiled, and were willing to help us.\nI remember when I was in Tokyo,\
  \ I wanted to do a journey to Hitachi Seaside Park and I did a lot of research about\
  \ the subway line before I went. However, in the middle of my journey, I had some\
  \ confusion about my next line. At that station I didn't find any English\u2019\
  s alphabet, all I saw was Japan's alphabet named \"Kanji\" . When I stood behind\
  \ the queue, which I didn't know whether it was the correct train, I asked a woman\
  \ whose age is around 50, she couldn't speak English. Fortunately, I brought a picture\
  \ of Hitachi Seaside Park and I showed it to her, and although she couldn't speak\
  \ english, She left her queue line and asked me to follow her, we walked around\
  \ 300M until we reached the correct line, then that a woman asked a young jappanesse\
  \ gentlement who was standing next to us, who was on the same train with me, and\
  \ then the woman said goodbye and went back to her queue line, The young gentlemen\
  \ who can spoke a little bit of English told me \"The woman who escort you to this\
  \ station, told me that you want to go to Hitachi.... so, after 3 stops you must\
  \ get out to the train and searching for the bus\"\nI also found a friendly atmosphere\
  \ in the restaurant, Since I brought a very limited amount of money to go there,\
  \ I always chose a low budget restaurant to eat juat like Yoshinoya. However, even\
  \ Yoshinoya is a low budget restaurant where still have hospitality standart. Everytime\
  \ I open the door of the restaurant, the waiters greet us with say \"Irasaimasen\"\
  \ which means \u201C Welcome\u201D . After we finished our food and were ready to\
  \ go home, the waiters said \"Arigatau gozaimatzu\" which means thank you very much.\
  \ \nWell, local people's attitude in every country is unique and I really love to\
  \ observe and interact with local people. In Japan,  I was really amazed with local\
  \ people\u2019s attitude. So far,  Japan's local people are the most welcome, kind\
  \ and helpful. I had a very good time in Japan. This is my writting about local\
  \ people in Japan, hope I can write about local people in Portugal."
