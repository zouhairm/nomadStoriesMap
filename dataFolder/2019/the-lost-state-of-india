Text: "Route:\n\nBhubaneshwar-Ganjam- Daringbadi - Dasinbadi- Chilika- Bhubaneshwar\n\
  \nSolo bike ride is something very close to my heart, it makes you feel the closeness\
  \ to nature and discover you inner voice! The ride to Daingabadi was planned well\
  \ before in advance in my mind but was not sue how safe it will be to ride on that\
  \ route due to recent Maoist attack in that area, my bike having Maharashtra No.\
  \ plate and moreover it had been through a recent makeover of camouflaged print.\
  \ Adding to it like a cherry over the cake was I being non Odian \u2013the city,\
  \ people and the routes were new! Though exploring new places is like one of the\
  \ most exciting thing for riders, I finally decided to take up a chance and decided\
  \ to ride towards Daringabadi.\n\nRide started on Saturday evening at 6pm. Weather\
  \ condition was clear and Indra Devta seemed to be blessing people of Odhisa with\
  \ pleasant breeze adding up to the mood, clear road surrounded by dark green mountains.\
  \ Distance from Bhubaneshwar to Daringabadi is 230_kms and I was pretty sure, it\u2019\
  s not possible to cover the entire route during late night hours. Also from localities\
  \ of that area, I had heard many stories about the Naxalites in those parts. Deciding\
  \ not to take further risk, I decided to take halt at Aska which is 170 km from\
  \ Bhubaneshwar.\n\nPreferring PwD guesthouse is like a trump card for riders as\
  \ it is cheap, well maintained and most of the time are vacant. By paying just 150\
  \ RS you could easily get a decent room amidst the dense forest. Have you ever experienced\
  \ being all alone in a king size room, surrounded by forest? If not then I must\
  \ say you must! If you are fortunate enough you will fall asleep soon otherwise\
  \ there are going to be moments where you will start visualizing white images and\
  \ hearing baby\u2019s laughter. \n\nNext day was going to be a complete adventure,\
  \ I woke up early morning and kick started the ride towards Daringbadi which was\
  \ around 75 km from Aska. \n\nRoute to Daringbadi is through heaven, dense green\
  \ forest which makes you feel more cheerful and the ghat on the other side symbolizing\
  \ the danger. It seemed to be symbolizing the reality of life where you have happiness\
  \ on one side and the wretchedness on the other side! One wrong move and your life\
  \ will flip 360 degree!  Blissfully song was being played on the music speaker of\
  \ my bike, roads were empty with just one or two heavy vehicles passing by and everything\
  \ seemed to be perfect! As the destination was getting closer, my excitement was\
  \ increasing and I could feel the butterflies in the stomach.\n\nThe view indeed\
  \ was amazing with clouds covering the view ahead, cold breeze all over and the\
  \ mist kissing you over the face! The environment was soothing, healing in which\
  \ was the hidden cure of humanity. There are couple of more places to visit like\
  \ butterfly park, Daringbadi nature park, Daringbadi lovers point. \n\nHowever I\
  \ couldn't find any couple, but some couple of dogs! \n I left for Dashingwadi waterfall\
  \ which was suggested by Localities there and is just 12kms away from Daringbadi.\n\
  \nIt\u2019s one of the most unexplored waterfalls and cannot be found on Goggle\
  \ Maps. The route to Dashingwadi is quite isolated and after travelling certain\
  \ distance on would surely get the feeling as if he is the last human on the planet.\
  \ Fortunately after riding half of the distance, I was able to see another human!\
  \ Without wasting a second, I stopped near him and asked him the route. That human\
  \ was a blessed soul and asked me to come along with him as he knew the exact destination!\
  \ \n\nParking my bike into the bushes, I walked 100 steps ahead and witnessed the\
  \ beautiful view of waterfall. \n\nThe sound and the power of pounding water makes\
  \ you forget all the sad things in the world! Taking some beautiful clicks, I started\
  \ by ride back to Bhubaneshwar.\n\n\nAs they say, short but sweet and filled with\
  \ lots of experiences, I reached back to Bhubaneshwar at 8pm.\n\n\nInsta : dsrimagination\n\
