Text: "Much like young, single women discerning where it\u2019s safe to travel alone,\
  \ ethnic minorities are also confronted with the same question. It\u2019s a sad\
  \ state of affairs, but nevertheless an uncomfortable reality, that having a darker\
  \ shade of skin could expose one to attacks from the more close-minded. I will be\
  \ honest that I did have this fear in deciding to go out of my comfort zone and\
  \ visit a place like Warsaw, which is often portrayed as a contemporary reincarnation\
  \ of 1960s America, with police dogs gnawing away at the knees of African-American\
  \ civil rights activists. \n\nInstead of my knees being gnawed away, rather, I was\
  \ plunged into a culture very different from my own. The language, the etiquette,\
  \ the food and more were all different to that I\u2019m familiar with but as opposed\
  \ to being brushed away on the basis of being an outsider, I was regularly welcomed\
  \ with smiles and smatterings of Polish greetings. Walking around, it was somewhat\
  \ comforting to see that other minorities were as crazy as me in deciding to visit\
  \ Warsaw. I recall walking into the city centre only to see a black man give me\
  \ a fraternal nod and smile, to which I dutifully returned, almost telepathically\
  \ saying to each other: \u201CI\u2019m not the only one who is here\u201D. And there\
  \ were also Asian tourists in the Warsaw Old Town, posing with various landmarks\
  \ and signs. Furthermore, walking around, I was comforted to hear Spanish being\
  \ spoken by quite a number of people. \n\nWarsaw is portrayed as being a hostile,\
  \ backward and isolated enclave but that wasn\u2019t my experience at all. In fact,\
  \ if the reactions of the locals were anything to go by, they have certainly seen\
  \ ethnic minorities before; this I gathered on the quality of just being able to\
  \ be \u201Cinvisible\u201D whilst I gaze at the architecture without being gazed\
  \ at by others as a human oddity, though understandable if it\u2019s the first time\
  \ they have seen someone who is clearly an outsider. \n\nAt least on the issue of\
  \ safety, having a darker shade of skin shouldn\u2019t put one off visiting Warsaw.\
  \ In fact, visiting Warsaw was an educational opportunity for me, as I encountered\
  \ names altogether different from \u201CJohn Smith\u201D. I struggled to pronounce\
  \ some of them, just as some have difficulty pronouncing my clearly ethnic name,\
  \ but on that front, we are more alike than different. Though on the issue of names,\
  \ it came as much surprise to me as I rushed to the airport when my Polish Uber\
  \ driver pronounced my name correctly the first time round. Now that is a lot more\
  \ than can be said for those at home!"
