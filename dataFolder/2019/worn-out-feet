Text: "Thank you. Thank you for revealing to me truth; when my selfish consumeristic\
  \ youth had taught me \u2018that money was the way to being free\u2019. I had once\
  \ believed; that having a key, and a door of my own, to a three-bedroom home; would\
  \ in fact complete me...Little did I see, my consumptionistic reality.\n\nI\u2019\
  d become a clone, with choices deeply sewn; into my \u2018comfort zone\u2019; Oh,\
  \ how little did I know! \n\nBut you helped to wake me, shook me up! You filled\
  \ my cup - with what you lived without. No doubt; much more life giving; you gave\
  \ rather than getting. A pilgrim on the road, with all that you owned, worn though\
  \ \u2018holy\u2019 clothes, a tattered rucksack upon your back, shoes breaking through;\
  \ from a troubled and sorded youth; you had now given way to; a much more righteous\
  \ truth...\n\nThat life means much more; when you own much less...\n\nYou offered\
  \ me grace that day, upon the Camino\u2019s way. We walked 35k, and to me you gave:\
  \ Your language (teaching me Spanish). You wove me a flower crown (as though I was\
  \ a queen), you showered me with dignity and shared with me your dreams. You also\
  \ let me listen to your story, about your \u2018fall from glory\u2019. In broken\
  \ English we would often guess - what each other meant. Then even in silence, you\
  \ still offered me your presence...A present worth a thousand words (that neither\
  \ of us could understand)! You had been travelling by foot, daily, for three years.\
  \ Back-and-forth; Whilst others talked-the-talk, you walked-the-walk; of laying\
  \ your burdens down. This Compestella cost you your whole life! Not because of sacred\
  \ sites, laying stones down in piles, or having paid the price; to \u2018make wrongs\
  \ right\u2019...But because you wanted to overcome...And OVERCOME YOU DID; Rid of\
  \ addictions, torment and afflictions, unlocking freedom within your own home...the\
  \ Cathedral, Temple and Kingdom of you own heart! You gave ALL that you owned, and\
  \ in doing so; lightened my load. By being true to yourself. \n\nYou said that others\
  \ often misunderstood. Carrying the burdens of their own judgements and opinions;\
  \ they\u2019d state \u201Cthis Camino\u2019s not for drunks - the homeless wanderers.\u201D\
  \ Then there were others; who were shocked to discover, they\u2019d stayed the night\
  \ beside another, nomadic travelling street-dweller. However there were also those\
  \ who let you in, paying the cost for warmth that evening, light transmitting, illuminating,\
  \ carers of us all. They said \u201CGive what you want, and take what you need\u201D\
  , and that you did (always without greed!) Giving your wisdom as feed; to those\
  \ of us who were hungry. Hungry to see; life from your reality. Thank you Jorge\
  \ for spending the day on 17th of the 8th, 2016."
