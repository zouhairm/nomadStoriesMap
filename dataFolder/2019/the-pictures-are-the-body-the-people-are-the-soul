Text: "Cue Instagram- an online world filled with pictures that will make you think\
  \ your life is simply not that spectacular.  This is how I felt when I booked my\
  \ flights to Bali, Indonesia. Despite being an avid traveler, the photos of Bali\
  \ made me think I was missing something from my life. Luscious trees, crystal waters,\
  \ blue skies and dramatic landscapes. A step far beyond Europe in my eyes. I wanted\
  \ to witness the beauty of this country for myself, but what I found was more than\
  \ what those pictures could ever portray. \n\nWe all know what we see on the internet\
  \ is the best of what a country has to offer. What we don't know is what \"the rest\"\
  \ of the country entails. I didn't expect to find myself, after an 18 hour flight,\
  \ sitting in a taxi for over an hour and hardly making it outside the airport district.\
  \ I didn't expect the generosity and hospitality of a nation so poor, an extra \u20AC\
  1 would make their day, and I couldn't help but acknowledge the self-pity the Western\
  \ society hold for themselves. I didn't expect that at 5 a.m in the morning I would\
  \ witness streets bustling with Balinese people doing their daily shop- motorcycles\
  \ with trays of eggs strapped on the back; people pushing small carts filled with\
  \ chopped up meat exchanged in a matter of seconds for thousands of Indonesian Rupees\
  \ as the locals drove by; fruits and vegetables in baskets, passed over with smiles\
  \ and waves. No shouting to get the attention of the locals, that was reserved for\
  \ tourists only. It was beautiful  to watch. An entire different world existing\
  \ before tourist time kicked in. \n\nI met many local people in my time in Indonesia.\
  \ Many of them were nice out of a societal pleasantness, whilst others shone as\
  \ being part of the soul of the country. One evening my partner and I enjoyed surf\
  \ lessons and beer by the sea. The waves at the beach were monstrous, and despite\
  \ my instructor's best efforts I must admit I failed terribly in this endeavor.\
  \ Despite the fact, it was one of my favorite evenings on the tiny Indonesian island,\
  \ not for the activity, but for the conversation. Ade, a proud Balinese citizen,\
  \ discussed with us why it was he would never leave his home country. Despite our\
  \ arguments that countries in the West earned more money and had a better standard\
  \ of living, his arguments always seemed to make our own feel empty. \"It depends\
  \ what you mean by a better standard of living, my friends.\" he said, as he stroked\
  \ his pet dog- Whiskey \" Look at my life here. I wake up early , I buy my groceries\
  \ from people I know and trust. I spend my days on the beach listening to the stories\
  \ of people who come from far and abroad and I think to myself \"It sounds to me\
  \ that every country has its issues.\" If that is so, why would I leave? This place\
  \ is beautiful, and yes we have our faults, but so do you, my friends.\" He really\
  \ struck us with that one. Now it became clear to me how the nation could be so\
  \ hospitable despite their poverty- they could recognize the good for the good,\
  \ and the bad for the bad, and accept that as it was. We left with a deeper understanding\
  \ of the country, but did have one last question. \"Hey, Ade!\" My partner asked\
  \ as we packed up to go \" how does it feel to be in an earthquake?\". Ade turned\
  \ and started to swing his hips \"Man, it's just like dancing, just gotta move with\
  \ the rhythm.\".\n\nI didn't expect to leave this country valuing the conversations\
  \ and mentality of the people over the Instagram worthy photo's I had on my camera.\
  \ The scenery had been breathtaking, beautiful, awe-inspiring, but they were places\
  \ ,and what we had gotten were stories. Stories which showed us the good and the\
  \ bad , and a nation which persevered through all of it. Stories which, on our return\
  \ home, would allow us to say- go for the people, not just the places."
