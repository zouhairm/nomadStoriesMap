Text: "There is a city in the world that connects Asia with Europe, it has had many\
  \ names around history but today we know it as Istanbul. The only time I have been\
  \ there was on January of 2015, I had too many expectations and I can assure you\
  \ that all of them were completely satisfied; but none of them were as magnificent\
  \ as the pleasure that I felt when I got lost. You will wonder, and I would be surprised\
  \ if you do not, why can be a pleasure to find yourself in a city where no one understands\
  \ you and you are not able to understand anyone... It is a bit frustrating, I can\
  \ not denied it. But when you are in a city as full of tourism as Istanbul, and\
  \ where everything is though in order to please the foreigner, it is good to find\
  \ some place where you are actually able to experience what is the real life of\
  \ the city. \n\nI have to start saying that we did not pretend to get lost, my family\
  \ and I were at Sultan Ahmed Mosque, one of the most recommended of tourist guides,\
  \ we got out of there and walked into a park, it was cold but sunny and some children\
  \ were running in there. We got hungry so we walked around the neighborhood looking\
  \ out for a place to eat. Suddenly, we realised that we were lost, we walked one\
  \ block, maybe two, and we found a little bazaar, it was like being in Aladdin's\
  \ movie. In a corner, a small boy was selling orange juice, my sister wanted some\
  \ and so did I, my father took out some money from his pocket and ask the boy in\
  \ spanish \"how much is it?\". Of course the boy did not understand any word that\
  \ he said, we were not longer at the downtown, he knew nothing about spanish as\
  \ we knew nothing about turkish. My sister asked in english but the result was the\
  \ same, he did not get a single word; so we had to be clever because we were not\
  \ giving up on the juice: my dad point one glass and then point the money, the boy\
  \ got it, he raised one finger and we understood that the price of a glass of juice\
  \ was one turkish lira. \n\nAfter we drank our juice, we walked around the neighborhood\
  \ and found a bakery, we went inside because I needed desperately a toilet. Perhaps\
  \ there was not any restroom in there, the place was so comfortable and warm, the\
  \ baker knew a little english and he noticed that I was charmed by one of the small\
  \ cakes he had in the counter, he gave it to me, when my father as how much, he\
  \ said it was free, it was a gift. Then we asked him about a toilet and he pointed\
  \ a cafe in front. We said goodbye and thank you. I finally could go to the restroom\
  \ and, when I went out, I tried my cake, it was the best thing I have ever proved\
  \ and I do not even know its name. \n\nWe realised that there is no really boundaries\
  \ for communication, and we have no regrets of getting lost. From now on, we start\
  \ to get lost on purpose, you should do it once, I promise you would be surprise."
