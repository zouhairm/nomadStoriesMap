Text: "It was a eerily cool evening before my 21st. The flair of doing something extraordinary\
  \ was at its highest. I didn't want the rustic dinner celebration ritual; I needed\
  \ it to be adventurous and different. The lowly skies sang a varied song over the\
  \ distant hill. The golden spattered rays painted the walls with the shadow of plants\
  \ on my window pane. Their colour was on the brink of life; the dull purple and\
  \ tamed green. I sat with my coffee mug, listing out the variety of activities I\
  \ could do. In bold I had Travel/Trek. Something within me needed an escape from\
  \ the mundanity of periscopic reality. Insanity within the folds of my mind craved\
  \ a relentless peace. The joy within my veins faltered, bearing on just a thread\
  \ of hope for tomorrow. I needed an escapade to make me sense life again. It was\
  \ all a pretence. When my parents asked about what special I would be doing I replied\
  \ smiling, \u201Csame old\u201D. Even though every bone in me wanted to skydive\
  \ away from existence.\nIn the spur of an endowed moment it was decided to venture\
  \ to the closest escape we could plan under an hour. This national park in asia\
  \ is most visited, accounting to a 2 billion footfall. The ease of being located\
  \ amidst the metropolitan is the only other speciality than being a huge park over\
  \ the suburbs of Mumbai.\nThe adrenaline coursing through the veins, it didn't feel\
  \ real anymore. The bold sun and the meek monkey walked on fours with us to the\
  \ Kanheri caves. The civilizations portray similarity in houses and monumented structures.\
  \ It is a perfect spot for a long walk with a view, a few boulders, very few.\n\
  A travel brings people together. It lets you recognize each other, bond with each\
  \ other and grow to know each other. These college buddies and me parked the car\
  \ to climb onwards onto the concrete steps leading us to history. The stone structures\
  \ built on a mount, the eery beauty in every crave, the silence in the breeze, the\
  \ outlines by the sun, the mixture of nature in leaves and rocks. Dome shaped monuments\
  \ stood in the center of caved architectures with supporting beams and echoing audio.\
  \ Every tourist bowed to capture the perfection of a dull room, lighted oh so dimly\
  \ by the raging sun. \n\u201CIt is similar everywhere\u201D said my friend, looking\
  \ over the multitudes of ways through the rocks accompanying the stone hedges of\
  \ look alike house. The only thing that changed for them is the view through irregular\
  \ openings from higher stances.\nI stared out in the open atop a wide hill as the\
  \ monkey made its way to us. Not a minute did he take his eyes off, waiting on us\
  \ to make any sudden move. If we did open a bag of chips, we could have surely been\
  \ scratched in pretence of acquisition. The widespread of greenery and vague desertification\
  \ made the air serene, fast and sweet. The beauty of all this lay in the silent\
  \ waves flowing over us.\nWe had the silence to take us away from the atrocities\
  \ at least for the timing, calming our worried souls and quenched the burning thirst\
  \ of unfulfillment. In this moment all we felt was whole and complete and wonderful.\
  \ \nIt is not about what you learn when you travel, it is about what you experience.\n\
  Like the shade of green on the leaves of trees that dance in the sun or the dries\
  \ grass splattering through the high winds of a barren stone hill, or the narrow\
  \ path that can lead you home. A home filled with peace and harmony, with no external\
  \ noise, with no thoughts, just you being ready and alive."
