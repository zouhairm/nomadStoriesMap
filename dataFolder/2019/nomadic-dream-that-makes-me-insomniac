Text: "The story is about a solo trek which is one of the toughest trek in the western\
  \ Ghats of Maharashtra. \nOne night when i was unable to sleep & dreaming of traveling\
  \ to new places & experiencing the new things. I toon my phone & started surfing\
  \ in the Google for trekking place near me,  there I come to know about \"DHAK BAHIRI\"\
  \ one of the most toughest trek in Western Ghats. After gathering some idea about\
  \ the place i got of the bed at 3: 00 am at mid night, graved some sweets, cookies\
  \ & 1 liter water bottle & started my journey by bike in the chilling night. \n\
  The destination is around 250 kms, & I started without any planning,  without any\
  \ route map, my hands started freezing while riding the bike.\nOn the way I spoted\
  \ a lake at early morning when the sun was not yet rised and there was a little\
  \ bit of light due to skylines before the sun rise.  I witnessed the most beautiful\
  \ morning of my life that day,  hearing the chirping of the birds & the breeze/mist\
  \ on the surface of thr lake was just flowing, it seems like i am in a heaven. This\
  \ mesmerizing view i will not forgot in my life. \nAfter spending some time at the\
  \ lake to wait for the sun to rise above the water level & the hill lines,  I continued\
  \ my ride towords the DHAK BAHIRI. After riding for more than an hour from the lake\
  \ i reached the starting trail of the trek. I parked my bike under a tree,  locked\
  \ it & started the trek without any idea about the route map.  \nInitially i lost\
  \ the route many times, than i observed the small red ribbons are tied to the brances\
  \ of trees & need to follow those to reach the base of the hill. I continued my\
  \ trek through the jungle all alone without any safety measures,  singing loudly,\
  \ dancing all the way,  the Execitment at that point time can't be expressed in\
  \ words. After 2 hours of jungle trek finally I reached the base of hill without\
  \ any problems. After standing at the base when i looked at the hill all the excitement\
  \ was blown off & started feeling nervous,  well I can say afraid. But after standing\
  \ there for few minutes & gathering all my courage I decided to climb the hill &\
  \ finish my trek. \nThe route to the destination was very steep,  almost 80 to 90\
  \ degree vertical.  Ropes & some rods are already tied at some places to help the\
  \ trekkers.  I started to climb the first cliff of the hill with a very nervous\
  \ mindset by holding the ropes for the safety.  And the intersing part is i came\
  \ back to base after completing the 1st cliff without continuing further. I kept\
  \ of mobile phone on video recording & started to climb one again,  this time I\
  \ was very confident & excited. I came back again to take my phone. Literally i\
  \ climed the 1st cliff of the hill thrice which I was afraid & nervous earlier to\
  \ attempt. \nFinally i hiked to the destination which was a small temple which is\
  \ carved in the hill. After reaching the top when i looked down the route i come\
  \ across,  i stay stunned for a while. I took my water bottle,  had some sip of\
  \ water and sat there for 15 mins looking around the jungle. \nAfter some rest I\
  \ headed back towards the bike,  by the time my all energy was drained off,  was\
  \ breathing heavily, somehow i reached back to bike,  had some buttermilk & lemon\
  \ water at the village nearby & headed back to home. \nInteresting & highlighting\
  \ point is i didn't spaot a single human being throughout my trek since it was a\
  \ weekday. \nBut even after all the risk I have taken this trek is my all time favourite\
  \ trek. I am planning to go there once again in the monsoon to witness the beauty\
  \ of the jungle,  water falls & the grernary."
