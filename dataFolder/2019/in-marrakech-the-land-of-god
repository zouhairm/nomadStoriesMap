Text: "One evening on what started off as an innocent, little roam around the popular\
  \ square Jemma el Fna, we found ourselves lost without knowledge of where we\u2019\
  d ended up than amid chaos. Mopeds appeared out of nowhere and filled up the crammed\
  \ pathways, pathways that accommodate either only pedestrians or mopeds- not both\
  \ together yet somehow with caution and diligence the system is normality to the\
  \ locals and tourists just have to abide. It did cross my mind a few times how fortunate\
  \ we are from westernized countries, the practice of safety whether as a pedestrian\
  \ or passenger in a car is such a foreign concept in Marrakech. It felt like being\
  \ in the hub of a train station in India but, perhaps a little less turbulent at\
  \ times only that would be a lie. The captivating foreign sound of musical pipes\
  \ and horns went off in the unknown distance as if to hypnotize and welcome us with\
  \ a magical sound of Moroccan culture and the further we walked, we found ourselves\
  \ right back to the square only this time welcomed by snakes, groups of men sat\
  \ in circles singing to the banging drums. Such revival.\n\nI\u2019d watched so\
  \ many travel documentaries on Marrakech that had left me with a growing interest\
  \ as most documentaries do. The thrills of good editing skills, visual effects,\
  \ winning soundtracks that sound like compiled greatness by the world's best orchestras\
  \ alongside a brilliantly articulated narrator\u2019s accent. I knew we\u2019d definitely\
  \ arrived and felt a great sensation of excitement mixed with caution. There was\
  \ pollution sitting in the air from those same mopeds and local delicacies being\
  \ cooked at street corners, it reminded me of late winter afternoons in South Africa\
  \ when I\u2019d spend weekends with my Father\u2019s parents. We all seemed to flock\
  \ around the shops at that time of the day where days were short and night time\
  \ too felt shorter if you were a kid having to wake up for school to that morning\
  \ chill. One odd feeling about the winter during childhood was the ability to sense\
  \ time before the sun could rise. Before light peaked through the curtains. I never\
  \ used an alarm clock to get up for school, by the time my parents stopped waking\
  \ me up getting up at a specific time was very natural and it had to with the stillness\
  \ of the moment, the tone around me, usually vibrations which I still do experience\
  \ now and then as an adult. \nLater in the day parents either just knocked off from\
  \ work so moms would be cooking and needing an item of ingredient or bread for the\
  \ following morning, usually a child would be sent to the shops and it is that memory\
  \ of passing each street corner, where a welcoming of smoke by the group of people\
  \ stood around a small fire either selling hand made snacks or fruit and vegetables,\
  \ in most cases it would be a group of lads just hanging about and making unnecessary\
  \ noise but those were the highlights and essence of late winter afternoons in rural\
  \ places. Much like the cars and mopeds going by each second in the little streets\
  \ and around the medina as if it were London rush hour, followed by this one distinctive\
  \ smell of Marrakech one could never forget. An aroma of mixed fragrances such as\
  \ jasmine, mint, lavender and incense. Each morning of our holiday we embraced the\
  \ winter sun far better than the uncertain English summer, I\u2019d wake up to meet\
  \ Nico upstairs on the rooftop of our Riad, sunbathing as we awaited our Moroccan\
  \ breakfast. I\u2019d always heard that travelling as a couple brings you closer\
  \ to each other, it was on this trip that I experienced that meaning. We fell more\
  \ in love and engaged with each other as ever before, comfortable enough to open\
  \ up about future travels together elsewhere and back to the city we felt had become\
  \ our adopted home. The more we explored Marrakech every day, the more I saw a lifetime\
  \ of happiness and eternal love with him, we belonged."
