Text: "Carbonara is delicious. Paella is mind-blowing. Escargot is basically a carrier\
  \ for garlic and butter so it's magnificent. Sm\xF8rrebr\xF8d is subpar. It is a\
  \ popular Danish cuisine which can be equivalised to those ham sandwiches you used\
  \ to eat for school lunch, only without the top piece of bread. Sure, Sm\xF8rrebr\xF8\
  d comes in a surfeit of varieties and recipes, no matter how many types of it I\
  \ tried, it always ended with a shrug. The delicacy is not gross or even bad, but\
  \ it also does not make you gorge every last bit until you are crying from both\
  \ excessive fullness and excessive happiness the way Carbonara does. It does have\
  \ the same heart jumping affect Paella has nor the inevitable large smile that grows\
  \ across your face after taking a bite of the buttery goodness that is escargot.\
  \ Nope. Just a shrug and a stomach full enough to get you through the day until\
  \ your next meal. \nI spent 5 months living in Copenhagen, Denmark, studying at\
  \ the University there. As a child, when I would hear about travel through stories\
  \ or movies or books, there was always this fascination with the food. After all,\
  \ food is one of the main pillars of culture. Its the epitome of experience. So\
  \ when I arrived in Europe for the very first time, ate my first European delicacy,\
  \ and all I got was salami on rye bread and some sort of mayonnaise-like spread,\
  \ I was feeling as subpar as the Sm\xF8rrebr\xF8d. I wondered if Denmark could possibly\
  \ be my great travel adventures like  Elizabeth Gilbert and Rosemary Mahoney wrote\
  \ about. Perhaps my \"Eat, Pray, Love\" experience would be \"Tentatively Eat, Pay,\
  \ Shrug\". \nI was wrong. Not about the Sm\xF8rrebr\xF8d. It's still not amazing.\
  \ But Copenhagen would absolutely be my great European adventure. Turns out, food\
  \ may be a pillar of culture but the foundation has always been the people that\
  \ surround it. My travel story is the moments spent drinking boxed wine and talking\
  \ to your two new friends till 3 in the morning on the rooftop overlooking the city.\
  \ It was the night I spent explaining American Football to friends while we ate\
  \ the tacos made on the single hot plate. The story is getting lost during a weekend\
  \ trip to Bergen, Norway but not caring because the pain in your stomach is from\
  \ laughing, not fear. It's watching the sunrise between the Copenhagen colorful\
  \ houses in Nyhavn seen on every post-card after spending an entire day walking\
  \ around the city with two people who went from strangers to family. A few wild\
  \ parties, dinner dates for 12, random dance parties. \nWhen I hopped on that plane\
  \ last year to move to a foreign city all alone, I had no intention of finding a\
  \ family. I had no expectation that the 5 months I would spend in Copenhagen would\
  \ end with long, tearful goodbyes to the greatest people I have ever met in my life.\
  \ I expected my travel story to be about how amazing food is and what grand architecture\
  \ there is in the castles. But the truth is, no matter where you go or why you go,\
  \ the good stuff is always found in the people."
