Text: "As the airplane touched the ground I breathed a sigh of relief. I had been\
  \ traveling for what seemed like forever and was in reality a full 17 hours. I looked\
  \ out the window and saw signs on buildings in an unfamiliar language in an unfamiliar\
  \ environment. Trees in exotic colors of green and orange were foreign to my dusty\
  \ Las Vegas home. The taste of adventure was waiting for me outside the plane. I\
  \ felt as though I were a little kid again waiting to open the biggest present under\
  \ the Christmas tree\u2014except the present was a week in Prague and I had no idea\
  \ what was in store for me.  \n\n\nI got through customs quicker than expected and\
  \ headed for the exit, where I saw my boyfriend, Will, who was studying abroad for\
  \ a semester. Our eyes locked, and running into his arms felt like home. We spent\
  \ the day walking around the city sharing stories of our semester apart, thankful\
  \ for this time together. \n\n\nThe next day marked the 100th anniversary of Czechoslovakia.\
  \ Prague was decked out in the national colors: red, white, and blue. It was cloudy\
  \ and cold, making the outdoors look less and less appealing, but I couldn\u2019\
  t stay inside! We made our way to Wenceslas Square to see the national military\
  \ parade, which happened to be the largest the country had ever mounted. Rank upon\
  \ rank of young soldiers marched by, followed by older veterans. I gazed in awe,\
  \ watching the crowds around me celebrate their love of their country. I thought\
  \ to myself that this was a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity, witnessing a moment\
  \ in history. I felt grateful and lucky to be able to travel to such an amazing\
  \ country and experience this in person. \nAs the day got colder, Will and I found\
  \ a coffee shop to keep us warm. A group of people walked past with Czech flag stickers\
  \ on their faces. We had seen the stickers advertised on the metro but did not know\
  \ what they were all about. I asked the group where they got them and learned there\
  \ were booths around town handing them out. This marked the start of another adventure:\
  \ the quest to find the face stickers. We trudged through the streets and indeed\
  \ saw several booths, but all were out of those stickers. We were getting numb from\
  \ the cold, and I was almost ready to give up, when I caught sight of a booth in\
  \ the next block that appeared to have some stickers displayed. Could they be the\
  \ ones Will and I were looking for? They were! We bought a bottle of wine to celebrate,\
  \ and called it a night.  \n\n       \nAll too soon my trip to Prague was ending,\
  \ and it was time to go back to Las Vegas. Just thinking about saying goodbye to\
  \ the city and to all the people who made my trip the adventure I had hoped for\
  \ made me cry. I felt many different emotions that last day. I was grateful for\
  \ spending a week with my best friend, sharing experiences in such an exciting new\
  \ environment. And I was sad and angry to be going back to my everyday reality without\
  \ him. I dragged my feet as I finished packing, and kept putting off when to leave\
  \ for the airport. But I made the flight.\nPrague had been magnificent. I got the\
  \ cultural immersion I wanted, picked up a bit of the language, and had some unforgettable\
  \ experiences. I met a cross-section of people that reminded me why I chose journalism\
  \ as a career. It\u2019s not to sit behind a desk five days a week, longing for\
  \ the weekend, but to get out and listen to people\u2019s stories and to share them\u2014\
  along with some of my own."
