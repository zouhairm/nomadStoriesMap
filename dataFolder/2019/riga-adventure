Text: "As long as I can remember, I have had the urge to explore new places and experience\
  \ exciting things. Due to the economic situation in my home country, I was not able\
  \ to travel as much as I wanted during my childhood. A few years ago, I realized\
  \ that the excursions to the neighborhood countries are very cheap. Since then a\
  \ lot of friends asked me how to do the similar. The thing that stopped me from\
  \ further exploration of the world, up to six months ago, was my fear of flying.\
  \ I overcome it when I was invited to the conference in Vienna, Austria. The flights\
  \ there and back were short and I really enjoy them.  Knowing my nature, I knew\
  \ they are just the first of many more to come.\nI have always found the Baltic\
  \ region interesting, but I had not been on my ''must visit'' list. Since I am interested\
  \ in psychology, I applied for the ''Mental Health among student population'' seminar\
  \ organized at the beginning of December 2018 in Riga, Latvia. I completely forgot\
  \ about it and when I got the e-mail of acceptation, I was positively surprised.\n\
  Then my leap into the unknown started. The moment of my long-time dream coming true\
  \ felt surreal.  For the first time ever I booked my own flight tickets. For the\
  \ first time ever, I was about to have the connecting flights. It was the second\
  \ time that I traveled abroad all by myself, but this was the first time by plane,\
  \ to a completely unknown land, in which I was coming in the middle of the night.\n\
  My journey began 2 days after my twenty-sixth birthday. I was really excited and\
  \ everything went perfect. Everybody I asked for anything at the airports was lovely\
  \ and 2 hours layover at Vienna airport was more than enough. When lending in Riga,\
  \ I found a cab within 5 minutes.This seminar was also the first occasion ever that\
  \ I was a roommate with a person I had never met before and that nobody else from\
  \ the participants spoke my mother tongue. Anyway, all worked out well.\nI had only\
  \ three days there and I decided to make the most of my free time. I am known as\
  \ sensitive to the cold, but not even low degrees and snow stopped me from exploring\
  \ the beautiful Riga by walking ( it really isn\u2019t as cold as you probably think).\
  \ The art nouveau architecture in Riga of the center of Riga really amazed me, as\
  \ well as their Christmas market in the Esplanade park that has a Ferris wheel and\
  \ a rabbit village. Every day we had dinner at some of the restaurants in the Old\
  \ town. I liked that since I always want to try local food. At first, some of the\
  \ dishes, like beetroot soup, potato pancakes, and rye bread pudding, might seem\
  \ odd,  but on the last day, you want to take all the food back to your home. \n\
  I only disliked the fact the daytime was really short. Nevertheless, Riga is so\
  \ magnificent that even nighttime sightseeing was fun, especially with an interesting\
  \ group of people. One of the best memories was walking back to the hotel from the\
  \ old town when we missed the last bus which took us more than half an hour.\nMy\
  \ road back home was via Copenhagen and while waiting for the second flight I thought\
  \ how much I learned on this trip. \nNot only have I met amazing people and learn\
  \ how to organize a mental health-related campaign, but I also visited one of the\
  \ most beautiful cities and meet the astonishing culture I knew nothing about and\
  \ realized how strong and capable I am. The things I thought would be tricky went\
  \ so easy and effortlessly. It all encouraged me to plan the next solo trips, and\
  \ one of them came soon afterward. In February this year, I visited Dusseldorf and\
  \ experiences I got in Riga helped me feel more free and encouraged on the trip\
  \ to Germany."
