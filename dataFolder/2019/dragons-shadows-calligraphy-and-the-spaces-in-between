Text: "On 13th of December 2016, I left London for what became my longest journey\
  \ in Asia so far. I did not know it at the time but I was not to return to Europe\
  \ for two whole years. Armed with miniature puppet shows, travel sketchbooks and\
  \ a camera, the essential part of my journey consisted in dogmatically avoiding\
  \ airplanes, so as to let myself flow between unknown places without skipping anything.\n\
  \nIn December 2017, I crossed the Chinese border for the very first time.\n  \n\
  After successfully obtaining my Chinese visa in Ulan Bator, I took the train and\
  \ minivan to Beijing, and during that journey, I suddenly recalled China used to\
  \ be one of my biggest early childhood secret fantasies. \n\nTo my great surprise,\
  \ the air in Beijing was clear! It was cold, dry and sunny. The food was absolutely\
  \ delicious. I was tired and thrilled.\n\nAs I strolled through hutongs (alleys),\
  \ avenues and parks, feelings and impressions from previous places were revived.\
  \ \n\nSurely, Mongolia was still deeply imprinted as this was where I had just come\
  \ from. But somehow, vivid memories of last Spring in Hokkaido also flashed in my\
  \ mind : I remembered feeling pretty sure I had found the ultimate Land of Dragons,\
  \ you know, those huge flying reptiles who spit fire, steam and smoke... They were\
  \ invisible yet spitting all over the island during my entire six weeks rambling,\
  \ in the form of volcanoes and onsens (natural hot springs), so I had easily figured\
  \ Hokkaido was nothing but one giant dragon of many mouths.\n\nWell, now in China...\
  \ dragons were all over, obviously. But in a completely different form, a much more\
  \ literal one, in that dragons were represented everywhere, in architecture, paintings,\
  \ statues, tea sets, even cookies...\n\nYet, in a slightly more inconspicuous way,\
  \ one thing was certain. I was once again in a land of high contrasts, brightly\
  \ hued shadows and those beautiful negative spaces that trigger emotions of complete\
  \ wellbeing and prevail in most Eastern philosophies. I could see this everywhere,\
  \ even in the way of brewing tea.\n\nMy experience of Mongolia had been strikingly\
  \ different as it was so vast and desolate, and its Sun so superiorly bright it\
  \ seemed to overexpose thus practically cancel most shadow possibilities; instead\
  \ it would cast nothing but light on the dust and micro crystals generously scattered\
  \ as much on the ground as in the air.\n\nBeijing... What else can I say?\n\nI was\
  \ well into my second week when I stepped inside the Forbidden City at last, guided\
  \ by shadows and noble crow calls, hunting for dragons and various other ornamental\
  \ creatures around every nook and corner.\n\nCalligraphy seemed omnipresent there,\
  \ like a raison d\u2019\xEAtre, so I was maybe starting to grasp pieces of its meaning.\
  \ If not, I was surely falling under its spells. How could I not? Even old men were\
  \ painting ephemeral characters with giant brushes dipped in water on the pavements\
  \ and parks of the capital city. These water calligraphies elegantly mingled with\
  \ the fine shadows of semi-naked trees. Then, as they dried, they faded out and\
  \ disappeared like magic. Thuuift! Yet, if you looked more carefully, you would\
  \ notice that they did in fact leave ghostly marks behind, which in turn could perhaps\
  \ cause you to re-feel the recent presences around this spot, of a man doing tai\
  \ chi, a passerby/a fl\xE2neur, a singing lad, a street sweeper, a slow cyclist,\
  \ a boy and his yoyo, an old couple taking turns in sitting in or pushing the wheelchair,\
  \ a rainbow ribbon being skilfully flown, a group of women merrily dancing to nostalgic\
  \ tunes... So I was catching myself looking at the World the way I look at calligraphy,\
  \ breathing smoothly, and perceiving the various movements and moments of the calligraphy\
  \ act.\n\nIt was fabulously refreshing to feel that such a massive and dynamic city\
  \ boasting hectic urban lifestyles, like any other big city, was yet able to reflect\
  \ a spirit and liveliness that were mostly gentle and delicate rather than hostile\
  \ or oppressive."
