Text: "I nearly cancelled my trip to Bali several times. My mind threw up all sorts\
  \ of unflattering mental images and unpleasant scenarios. It ran through a litany\
  \ of cons and why I really shouldnts. I love to travel and was really surprised\
  \ at the amount of resistance I experienced. Deep down I knew it had to do with\
  \ fear. Fear of the unknown, fear of travelling solo for an extended period of time,\
  \ fear of not having the container of a retreat or a training or anything at all\
  \ to fall back on that would give me a sense of structure. I was to be on my own,\
  \ for three weeks, in a place half way across the world. Nearly having cancelled\
  \ the trip, I finally got tired of my own indecisiveness and committed myself to\
  \ this adventure. \nI now sit on my balcony in Ubud, into my sixth week of the trip,\
  \ having extended my stay by an additional four weeks. \nIt is hard to put into\
  \ words what I found here in this beautiful, magical land that feels like a vortex\
  \ of love and deeply transformative healing. I felt it\u2019s heartbeat and sensed\
  \ it\u2019s deep, soulful aliveness the minute we pulled out of the airport parking\
  \ lot. I was spellbound as we sped by countless stone statues of Hindu deities,\
  \ the ancient looking ruins or half ruins that gave the place an air of mystique,\
  \ never desolation. The blackened stone carved into the most intricate patterns\
  \ decorating every entryway into a maze of family compounds. Every entryway and\
  \ alleyway a mysterious passage into an unknown world. I couldn\u2019t stop craning\
  \ my neck, wanting so much to not miss a thing, which of course was impossible.\
  \ \nWhen we got to Ubud, where so far I have spent the majority of my time here,\
  \ I was welcomed with open arms into a Balinese family compound where they told\
  \ me I was now a part of their family and to feel at home, never hesitating to ask\
  \ for anything at all that I may need. I spent the next few weeks moving around\
  \ Ubud, I lived with a Balinese family, I lived in a small villa in a rice field,\
  \ I lived in a small artists village right outside central Ubud, I took yoga and\
  \ ecstatic dance classes, I took tours to beautiful temples, I choked up when I\
  \ looked down into the valley and beheld the majestic mount Batur and Agung volcano\
  \ crowned with soft white clouds. I ate Balinese dishes and enjoyed the abundance\
  \ of healthy food options that Ubud is known for. I\u2019ve felt my body relax and\
  \ my heart and mind open in ways I never thought they would after taking some boundary\
  \ and limitation shattering classes, like conscious movement and contact improv.\
  \ I faced my fears when I took scooter lessons and my soul melts every day at the\
  \ deep earthy warmth and smiling hospitality of the Balinese people. \nI never thought\
  \ one could fall in love with a place, but now that it\u2019s happened to me, I\
  \ can say that it\u2019s been one of the most magical and gratifying experiences\
  \ of my entire life. I feel I have fallen deeply in love with not just this island\
  \ and it\u2019s people, but with the whole world and with life. \nI am now and forever\
  \ grateful."
