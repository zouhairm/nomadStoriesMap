Text: "Lately, there had an awareness that her heart needed to be exfoliated. Too\
  \ much residue had collected in its crevices; a build-up of old, sticky things like\
  \ the gnawing familiarity of her room, the unchanging texture of her carpet, the\
  \ sameness of the chipped end of her bedside table. It clung to her heart and weighed\
  \ it down. A gentle exfoliation was needed. Naturally, she bought a train ticket\
  \ to somewhere. Where? That was unimportant. What was important was the difference.\
  \ \n\nShe was quite alone in the train compartment. One might expect a stranger\
  \ to enter the compartment for purposes of a story, but the truth is that she was\
  \ the only stranger there. She gazed out of the window, pretending to look at the\
  \ bustling station, but she was really examining herself in the faint reflection.\
  \ She felt as faded as it looked. \n\nShe settled back in her seat and let herself\
  \ sag, like when you squeeze a mop cloth dry of all water. \u2018Slack\u2019 is\
  \ an even better word because it has lack in it and her face lacked an ampersand.\
  \ It was the end of a sentence. \n\nThe train chugged sluggishly to life and the\
  \ station slid backwards into a corner of her head. Travelling to a place always\
  \ has a spell of in-betweens: the coming and the going. It was easy to arrive but\
  \ it was difficult to leave. It always felt like you\u2019d left something of yourself\
  \ in a place that you won\u2019t find again; that when you were leaving, you would\
  \ be suspended in a limbo of sadness over the transience of what you\u2019d felt.\
  \ But for now, she was in the in-between of arriving. There was a breath of anticipation;\
  \ an interest in disembarking into a different station; the thrill of sitting on\
  \ a new bench not seen before. The same sights in a different place made it a familiar\
  \ adventure. When the train puffed into the station, she examined it with an eager\
  \ hunger and felt a layer drop away from her heart. She\u2019d arrived.\n\nThe taxi\
  \ dropped her off at the cottage she\u2019d rented for three days. She was pleased\
  \ to see it had a wild garden and a pond fringed with overgrown reeds. The gate\
  \ creaked, as it looked like it would have, when she swung it open. Dropping her\
  \ bag in the kitchen, she headed to the bedroom to scrutinize the bedside table.\
  \ This one wasn\u2019t chipped but it was wobbly; the drawer slid open in the pleasantly\
  \ noisy and cheerful way that only old wood possessed. Nothing was inside except\
  \ a faded receipt for orange juice and eggs. She took a pleased breath. Others had\
  \ passed through the cottage and left afterimages of their stay. It felt like a\
  \ friendly message. \u2018I had eggs and orange juice,\u2019 whispered the kitchen\
  \ table. \u2018Fingers that are not yours pulled me open,\u2019 murmured the bedside\
  \ drawer. More residue crumbled away from her heart onto the floor and she kicked\
  \ it under the bed for spiders to eat. That\u2019s what made their webs so sticky.\
  \ They dined on viscous heart dregs.\n\nShe went to the store in the evening and\
  \ returned with her own receipt: beer, a loaf of bread and some milk. The receipt\
  \ was placed within the same drawer for the next traveller to find. For a while,\
  \ she would be briefly known to a stranger through a piece of paper. The idea gave\
  \ her a solemn excitement.\n\nThe sun had sunk a while ago and an earthy coolness\
  \ settled upon her shoulders. She had travelled to find a different night and now\
  \ night had done the same. This was their halfway house; a secret tryst of old friends.\
  \ A wicker chair and the beer accompanied her to the pond. The crack and the swift\
  \ hiss as she opened the beer greeted the rising moon as it crept into the sky and\
  \ swam into the pond. She gazed at it in the pool of water as it gleamed waveringly,\
  \ shrouded by the reeds. And then she caught sight of her face.\n\nHer face no longer\
  \ lacked. It shone brightly in the water. \n\nAnd bloomed anew like a nocturnal\
  \ flower."
