Text: "It was in the capital of Malaysia, Kuala Lumpur that everything I had ever\
  \ claimed to know disappeared. The world seemed to of been placed on fast forward.\
  \ Someone had brought the volume up to maximum. Dizziness set in. My eyes could\
  \ not keep up with the morning rush of the city. Panic set in. How was I expected\
  \ to explore this city when I had no clue how to cross the road in front of me.\
  \ I was only 12 hours from Australia, a country I had just spent the past six months\
  \ in. It felt like worlds away. This was it though. This was what I had always wanted.\
  \ The unknown, the chaos, the true feeling of being in Asia, alone. It was time\
  \ to sink or swim. I had to make the most of this opportunity.\n\nIt was a quick\
  \ realization that life in the west can be a sheltered life. Suddenly, I was in\
  \ a place where a lot of people live hard lives and work long hours just to make\
  \ ends meat. It didn't take long but I began to find myself thriving in this environment.\
  \ Eating food that I had never known before and loving them. Meeting people, talking\
  \ to strangers and making a connection. From that time onward, I was hooked. Travel\
  \ became my sole purpose in life. It was and is all I wanted to do. What was once\
  \ a dream became an active obsession. I couldn't stop the urge to see new places,\
  \ eating new foods and meet new people. My life changed instantly. Sitting on a\
  \ plastic stool that first night with a bowl of clay-pot rice in front of me, it\
  \ was the first time in my life that I was exactly where I wanted to be. \n\nLooking\
  \ back to that time in Kuala Lumpur, I cannot help but laugh. Since then, my travels\
  \ have taken me to places such as China, India, Cambodia and many more. It then\
  \ took me back to where it all began. Upon returning to Kuala Lumpur, I was flooded\
  \ with memories. Four years on and countless cities and countries later, yet I remembered.\
  \ I remembered the streets, the little oddities that I had seen. It all felt so\
  \ familiar. The feeling had changed though. It was as if the city had slowed down.\
  \ I came to the realization that it was not the city that had changed, but me. I\
  \ was far more accustomed to this way of life now. Cities like New Delhi, Hanoi,\
  \ Kolkata had shown me how fast life really can be. I had seen a poverty line far\
  \ lower than what exists in Malaysia. It was an emotional time.\n\nThey say the\
  \ road changes you. I had always been adamant that this was not the case. I felt\
  \ that I was that same 22 year old. I couldn't be more wrong. I had lived a life\
  \ those past four years that was so different to anyone I know. A steady job and\
  \ a steady income seemed so safe that it frightened me. My outlook began to change\
  \ from that moment. My website www.roamingirishman.com was launched shortly after.\
  \ In truth though, this was years in the making. It was on the streets of Kuala\
  \ Lumpur, that events began unfolding. I failed to realize the significance of that\
  \ first meal, that first day in the city. It shaped my life and changed the path\
  \ I was on. The Roaming Irishman was born in those moments, I just hadn't realized\
  \ yet."
