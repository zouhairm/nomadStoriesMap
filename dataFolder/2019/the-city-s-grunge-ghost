Text: "The city sounds mix together like a potpourri in my psyche that I\u2019ll carry\
  \ forever; the Westlake Terminal vibrates inmutable making never ending time-space\
  \ connections. Seattlelites waiting for their transport to get to the edges of town,\
  \ everyone carrying stories about this northwest city that once flirted with the\
  \ name of \u201CCity of Grunge\u201D home of tech companies, Jimi Hendrix and edgy\
  \ vibes.\nBut there\u2019s a price to pay to walk these streets, this city synonym\
  \ of progress coexist with ghosts\u2026\nI board the subway to Pioneer Square; hustling,\
  \ passengers getting on and off, checking their phones, they don\u2019t notice a\
  \ passenger is being attacked by ghosts or they might as well know, no one helps,\
  \ nobody ask what are this ghost she\u2019s fighting? Why the tremors and aggressive\
  \ conversation with nobody, why the seizures? This ghosts threat to kill the victim\
  \ in the middle of this subway, we pass near indifferent trying to get wherever,\
  \ we normalize it, although we don\u2019t see the ghosts we name them. I get off\
  \ on my stop hoping a burst of air will clear that scene; these entities taking\
  \ citizens of all sorts in broad daylight aren\u2019t that scary phenomena anymore,\
  \ now they appear in public leaving a trace of used needles, human waste, homelessness\
  \ and buzz due to the ambulance that left murmur and traffic behind.\n\nThese experiences\
  \ with the ghosts of addiction in Seattle have become personal, I couldn\u2019t\
  \ help but judge addicts as weak, spoiled by the system that offer a way out, I\
  \ got angry thinking about the high rates of suicides and addiction here, but low\
  \ rates of addiction and suicides in El Salvador where I\u2019m from, where poverty\
  \ and corruption are  scary poltergeists. I felt stronger than them, I felt inmune\
  \ to the ghosts of Heroine, Fentanyl, Meth, etc. I\u2019m here to experience the\
  \ bright lights, the modern times utopia I though. Underestimating the gates of\
  \ sorrow where these ghosts wander.\nOn a February 14 the day exhaled a golden afternoon,\
  \ with noisy festive people carrying flowers celebrating Valentine\u2019s and hectic\
  \ Starbucks, the ghost visited me as an overdose of pharmaceuticals, it travelled\
  \ through a text message from my Mom back in my country, it was scary. My Uncle\
  \ chatted with this ghost letting himself go to dead. I felt guilty, anger and emptiness\
  \ in waves drowning me. I cried remembering the faces of the addicts of Seattle,\
  \ remembering the indifferent NO! I said to them. Once I classified drugs epidemic\
  \ as first world problems, once I was inmune, that moment I understood the pain.\n\
  Cold months went by; the winter lasted so much in this region, my lens and filter\
  \ of reality were gloomy too, my uncle, couldn\u2019t kill himself that day and\
  \ went in a coma, the ghost couldn\u2019t take him like it takes so many here, I\
  \ tried to be happy because he was alive and to connect here my home, and I couldn\u2019\
  t.\nBut a trivial event changed my outcome: I went to get coffee before work, I\
  \ sat to wait  and a guy sat next to me. \u201CHe looks Junkie\u201D I thought.\
  \ How is it going? He said, \u201C Could be better\u201D I replied. Then he told\
  \ me a resilience story, a reminder of human will, \u201CIt\u2019s beautiful today\
  \ I just woke up 3 days ago from a coma of heroin overdose, my family stood by me,\
  \ I\u2019m grateful to be here now\u201D\u2026 as he wrote something on his notebook.\
  \ I held tears, I felt warmth, I told him how proud I was and to never give up to\
  \ the ghost, although I didn\u2019t knew him I realize my words deep down were to\
  \ my uncle, to me. He said goodbye, \u201CI have a detox therapy this afternoon\u201D\
  \ and left.\nI never saw him again, yet I feel him, I feel them, I made a human\
  \ connection in this corner of the Earth. I can\u2019t make the drugs problems in\
  \ society go away myself, it requires a change in the system and even though my\
  \ uncle is still in a coma to this day, he makes sure I greet the victims of drugs\
  \ with a smile every day I walk the streets."
