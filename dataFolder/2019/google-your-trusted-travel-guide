Text: "It would have to be the trip I took to Australia. I come from and live in Papua\
  \ New Guinea.\nI\u2019ve been to Australia a couple of times \u2013 back in the\
  \ day for high school excursions, a family tour to Cairns and another to Canberra\
  \ for a conference, but this trip to Australia has to be the most daring and well\
  \ \u201C a leap into the unknown\u201D.\nIt was out of love. Purely out of love.\n\
  It was to a place called Orange.  Located in the New South Wales. \nThanks to Google\
  \ \u2013 I got to know so much more about the place and obviously how to get there.\n\
  Trust me, there are no oranges there! I later got to find out.\nI wanted to surprise\
  \ this special person. We had started this cold war (forever this war!) and I felt\
  \ I had to make it up to him.\n\u201CI\u2019ll go see him\u201D I told myself and\
  \ not telling anyone else.  I was going to do this without anyone knowing. Well\
  \ \u2013 only the people who had to help me get there.\nHaving a professional background\
  \ in Computers, most of my time is spent on the internet and on the computer \u2013\
  \ so there I was on Google, searching \u201CPapua New Guinea Port Moresby to Orange,\
  \ Australia\u201D\nI had to take a plane - domestic flight, from where I was in\
  \ Alotau, Milne Bay Province (at the time) to Port Moresby and then get on the international\
  \ flight from Port Moresby to Brisbane, another plane trip to Sydney and then since\
  \ there was no flights, I think, at the time to Orange, I considered the option\
  \ of using the train and the coach services \u2013 from Sydney to Bathurst and to\
  \ Orange.\nFor my return travel, I had got my ticket from Sydney back to Brisbane\
  \ back to PNG.\nI had searched for all the possible options online through Google\
  \ search and had come up with my travel itinerary.  Paid for my flights online and\
  \ the coach service AND the train.\nThe timings of the train and coach service and\
  \ the arrival time of my flight in Sydney was very close that if I missed one part\
  \ of the travel, I\u2019d miss it all.\nThe other thing \u2013 I was on a transit\
  \ visa to Australia \u2013 which allowed for me to be in Australia for only 72hours!\
  \ 3 days! \nI was so determined to do this trip and confident that I could pull\
  \ it off.\nThe only two people I got in touch with, who knew I was doing the trip\
  \ was a Kenyan friend, I met at work some time back, who was my friend\u2019s colleague\
  \ in Orange.\nI had emailed her to check if he would be in town that weekend, seeing\
  \ that he usually goes out hiking and camping.  Fate was on my side- she replied\
  \ back to tell me that he would be.\nThe other person was my best friend in Port\
  \ Moresby, who would be picking me up from the airport and dropping me off for my\
  \ international flight to Australia, early hours of the morning.\nSide note \u2013\
  \ I was 4 months expecting my son \u2013 who is 8 now! So I had a travel companion\
  \ :)\n\u201CYou are crazy doing this trip!\u201D My best friend told me.\nI had\
  \ very limited Australian Dollars and my friends helped me out with some cash, enough\
  \ to at least get me a snack, some credits to call and bus fare incase anything\
  \ \u2013 otherwise I was on my own.\nThe plane trip from Port Moresby through Brisbane\
  \ to Sydney got me arriving 10 minutes earlier to my advantage.\nI am so grateful\
  \ for maps, and signboards and helpful people along the way who directed me to the\
  \ train station \u2013 I made it to my train a minute before the train doors were\
  \ closing.\nWhat a relief it was to be sitting in the train!\nThe temperature started\
  \ dropping as we did the many stops and on the coach I went to Orange.\nMy friend\u2019\
  s colleague was waiting for me and took me to his home.\nSurprise pulled off! Mission\
  \ accomplished!\nBy the way \u2013 I missed my return flight back \u2013 but that\u2019\
  s another story!"
