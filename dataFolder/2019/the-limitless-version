Text: "Sitting at the backseat of our travel bus, I was cursing that very moment when\
  \ I signed my name for this official trip. Surrounded by cars, jeeps, motorbikes,\
  \ and a hell of a lot of pedestrians, our bus was mercilessly stuck in the traffic\
  \ on this narrow lane at the hills of Dhanaulti, Uttarakhand. And, there was no\
  \ way it can move ahead. The only option that we were left with was trekking, and\
  \ the camp area was still around 3 miles away. \n\nIt was 10 o-clock in the morning,\
  \ and we hadn\u2019t have our breakfast yet. Moreover, when your body was moving\
  \ like a pendulum in the bus whole night, and you hardly got a good sleep, then\
  \ you may just not show up with your backpack for two hour long stroll. Nevertheless,\
  \ when we started trekking, the alluring views of lush green landscapes and friendly\
  \ encounters with the locals made us feel what we would have missed out on had we\
  \ travelled to our camp area via bus. A look at the small and broken shops of the\
  \ locals and their hospitality might just fill you with generosity, and urge you\
  \ to question your demeanour if you were at their place.  \n\nSomehow, as we reached\
  \ the venue while slithering down the slope from the main road, the exhaustion took\
  \ a toll on us, and we decided to take some rest. Though, my body wanted me to slow\
  \ down, my mind was constantly wandering in quest of an amazing story that can make\
  \ people feel inspired, amazed, or at least entice their inherent explorer to come\
  \ out and experience what this beautiful world has in its store for them. I have\
  \ always been fascinated by such stories that manage to create a magic in someone\u2019\
  s life. And, I wanted to have one! \n\nThe whole day passed swiftly, and as the\
  \ evening approached, we were all set for a bonfire party. Our return journey had\
  \ been scheduled for the next evening, and thus, I wanted to make the most of every\
  \ moment. I love parties, loud music, and a gathering of lively people who just\
  \ want to have fun. But, something was missing that night. I was again cursing myself\
  \ if I travelled the distance of around 300 kms just to experience a bonfire party\
  \ amidst the snow-capped mountains! The music was so loud, I could barely hear anyone\u2019\
  s voice. Still, my ears were quite attentive to hear a tune that may just enliven\
  \ my soul. \n\nAnd, here came the last day of the trip. Our manager asked everyone\
  \ to gather near pantry corner for a discussion over what to do next before departure.\
  \ Due to time constraint, it was decided to indulge in some adventure activities\
  \ available in the campsite only rather than exploring nearby surroundings. Everyone\
  \ was quite excited to demonstrate what a sport they are. As they went one by one\
  \ to partake in rope walking, I was all there to boost their enthusiasm, \u201C\
  Yes, you can do that.\u201D Some managed to cross the halfway, while some just gave\
  \ up. When few of us were left to participate, a friend of mine asked me to give\
  \ it a try. As the guard was binding safety belt, I asked him what if I fell off\
  \ the rope midway, how he would be going to rescue me. And, he asked me to have\
  \ faith in myself. There is nothing a thin girl with a height of 5\u20191\u201D\
  \ cannot achieve. As I begun walking on the rope, a few of my friends started cheering\
  \ me up, while some assured me it\u2019s okay if I too couldn\u2019t complete the\
  \ challenge. By the time I reached midway, I started shivering. I took a deep breath,\
  \ and reminded myself what a limitless person I can be. With focus on the center\
  \ of every criss-crossed rope to maintain balance, I took one step at a time. And,\
  \ voila! I won the challenge. Everyone was agape and aghast how a tiny girl with\
  \ short legs managed to do that. And, so was I!"
