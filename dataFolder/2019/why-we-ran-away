Text: "It\u2019s probably a Tuesday when James says, \u201CI remember why we ran away.\u201D\
  \ \n\nIt feels like a Tuesday. Most days feel like Tuesdays. Like days without consequence\
  \ or label or importance. Nothing days.  \n\nBut what James says cannot be true.\
  \ I never told him. I never told anyone the real reason and besides, James and I\
  \ have only known each other for a few weeks. We have not run away together anywhere.\
  \ We have stood still together in the same city and in the same hostel and are similarly\
  \ friendless and drink the same cheap Escudo as everyone else. \n\nJames is from\
  \ England and fresh into adulthood and his face shows it. He is enough years my\
  \ junior that his existence reminds me that I am too old to be living the same life.\
  \ His hair is short, curly, and always attractively disheveled. His cheeks are always\
  \ a bit pink, he is tall and lean with proper posture, and only speaks post-pensiveness.\
  \ His quiet demeanor is either a sign of nerves or coolness. It is anyone\u2019\
  s guess. During the day, he cleans the hostel to earn his keep and during the night\
  \ he DJs for the insomniacs and jetlagged guests in the lounge.\n\nJames and I have\
  \ one primary thing in common, neither of us are supposed to be here. A friend of\
  \ James roped him into this trip. He was working on a farm with his friend in the\
  \ Argentinian wine district when he decided it was boring. So, he left his friend\
  \ behind, crossed over into Chile, landing at La Chimba. He isn\u2019t sure when\
  \ his friend is coming to meet him only that his friend is coming. James seems indifferent\
  \ about this whole trip. But he could be scuba diving near the Great Barrier Reef\
  \ and seem equally indifferent. Or maybe, he is in shock. \n\t\nIt is anyone\u2019\
  s guess. \n\nNo one remembers much here. It\u2019s how Santiago got its nickname,\
  \ \u201CThe Vortex\u201D. Some people remember when they were just passing through\
  \ before they fell in love after attending their new lover\u2019s family\u2019s\
  \ asado a week after meeting, before they had trouble locating parts for their broken\
  \ van or motorcycle, or before they decided Santiago made a suitable hiding place\
  \ from their ex-boyfriend. \n\nMost people can\u2019t remember how long they\u2019\
  ve been here. \n\nNo one knows when they\u2019re leaving.  \n\nTravelers, non-travelers,\
  \ transplants, all of their backstories begin with their arrival abroad never with\
  \ their departure from home and never with home itself. \n\nI came alone. I tell\
  \ people that I came to this hemisphere because I want to learn Spanish. They laugh.\
  \ I laugh. The conversation changes. That\u2019s how I like it. \n\nJames never\
  \ explains what he remembers because I never respond. Instead, we gaze at the Andean\
  \ range which wraps around the borders of Santiago\u2019s sprawl, snowcaps blur\
  \ into a thickening smog, and we stand at the center.\n\nBut then maybe, Santiago\
  \ isn\u2019t a vortex. Maybe, I\u2019m in shock.\n\nIt is anyone\u2019s guess."
