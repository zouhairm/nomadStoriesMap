Text: 'Life can be funny at times it can be a roller coaster ride of so much emotions
  .

  The unexpected discovery of a new location ,the thrill that comes with finding out
  a new style of living ,the excitement that accompanies the process of learning a
  new language ,all of this relates to our everyday lives.

  I am one to embrace new cultures ,try out new food , understand the customs and
  traditions of the natives of a new place,how they came to existence ,their rules
  ,their history ,their moments the events that led in one way or the other to the
  beauty of this new place.

  Practically is like ,taking a piece of paper and from the onset ,viewing and realising
  green pastures ,morning sunshines and chilly cold breezes.

  The type of animals and wildlife that coexist in this mix of cultures and traditions,how
  modern life has influenced it''s core.

  Drawing infinite lines of sand bays ,the early waves from the water bodies .

  The essence of the location for a moment you are immersed in a new habitat a great
  scenery,you have a fresher perspective ,you have a heartbeat of new sightseeing
  and above all soak in the location and all of its awe and beauty.'
