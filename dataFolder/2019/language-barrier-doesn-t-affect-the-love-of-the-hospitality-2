Text: It was the fine bright after noon when i arrived at a small town call Dilijan
  in Armenia , it was my first trip internationally from India and i am really nervous
  where i will go and how the actions and reactions will take place where very few
  people understand my language. I am travelling to Armenia for a voluntary work and
  have to stay with a local host family who probably do not know English, hence when
  i stepped out of the car it is unexpected to me to live with a family who even doesn't
  understand what i am saying . With a smile on my face and a sense of in security
  i went into the house , they showed me up my room and i find it good. I am kind
  of person who loves to interact and talk with people but when i went to common dining
  room we all are unable to communicate  but soon after a small talk we all are using
  sign language to communicate and the flow of words are not with mouth instead they
  are flowing from my hands  and the actions this is a really wonderful experience
  , though i am away from my home i got my mom dad and a brother who loves me like
  a family and soon i because a part of the family in each and every celebration and
  i didn't even realize they i am not in my home . But this is not the end i am also
  currently leaving with them with a lots of joy. so in my opinion language are the
  man made things that may differ but emotions are natural and one cannot lie with
  it and the love from the actions which i am getting are memorable part of my life.
