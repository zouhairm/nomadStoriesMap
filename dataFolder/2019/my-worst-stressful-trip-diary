Text: "After a busy year of too many events, I decided to travel to ease the stress\
  \ so, I booked a flight ticket and got set for my trip. \n\nMy flight was slotted\
  \ for 1:43pm so, I set out early understanding that you can't predict Lagos traffic.\
  \ \n\nI started my journey to the airport and to my greatest surprise Lekki epe\
  \ expressway way wasn't really choked as usual aside the regular traffic light control.\
  \ While the bus was on transit, we were all calm enjoying our trip and suddenly,\
  \ a fellow commuter had stated an argument with the bus conductor about alighting\
  \ at a particular bus stop and the driver didn't stop because that wasn't a designated\
  \ bus stop.\n\nThis argument got really serious and in Lagos buses, once the conductor\
  \ is at fault its almost like the judge pronouncing a death sentence because, over\
  \ 60% of the passengers in the bus will lash out at him. \n\nLagos is a very busy\
  \ metropolis so, people sometimes vet their anger at work or other engagement for\
  \ the day on these bus conductors and other road users. After the issue was resolved\
  \ and the passenger alighted, we continued the journey till we got to cms which\
  \ was the finally busstop. \n\nBefore we got to cms the conductor, was meant to\
  \ give some passengers balance but in Lagos its called \"change\" which he didn't\
  \ have that was another episode of lashing for him and trust me, some Lagos conductors\
  \ can be frustrating. \n\nI got to cms and I decided to order a taxify that will\
  \ take me straight to the airport. I ordered the cab and I called the driver to\
  \ tell him my destination and between central bank building to saka Tinubu Square\
  \ took him am estimated 15 minutes because, Lagos Island is a very busy place too\
  \ and you must understand the route if not, you will fall a victim to lastma and\
  \ other road warden officers.\n\nWhen he finally arrived I told him I have less\
  \ than 30minutes to be at the airport so he said \" oga mi, no problem\" he started\
  \ the journey and I was impressed with his driving and we had some light discussion\
  \ with a light music playing on the background and it was an interesting ride. We\
  \ saw 3 different accidents that one at third mainland bridge the bus was completely\
  \ burnt down, the other was a Mercedes Benz have a coalition with a truck around\
  \ oshodi expressway way and the third just before navigating into airport road proper\
  \ we saw corolla in another coalition with a bus. \n\nI got to the airport and the\
  \ driver parked, he said \"oga abeg rate we 5 star and I told him I will and I did\
  \ as promised. \nAfter our conversation, I went straight to Dana Air desk for checkings\
  \ only for the lady at the canter to tell me the flight was about to take off and\
  \ I told her it can't be because I still had like 20 minutes she smiled and checked\
  \ me in. I got on the plane and it was a smooth flight. I had a brief discussion\
  \ with my seat partner and it was a nice chat. We had the child on board that kept\
  \ on crying almost till we landed and I wondered why. People brought out their phones\
  \ when we landed and some were taking pictures, other were calling but I was already\
  \ tired so I reached out for my phone and I called a few people to let them know\
  \ I have arrived. \n\nArriving at obong Victor attah Airport in uyo, getting a cab\
  \ to my destination was another issue I had to bargain because I didn't know my\
  \ way around so, I made calls to confirm price and we reached an agreement. I felt\
  \ the peace and although the journey from the airport took about 2 hours but the\
  \ roads were free and the atmosphere was different on like Lagos. I got to my destination\
  \ and I was already exhausted but I was happy because I met the people I haven't\
  \ awe in years."
