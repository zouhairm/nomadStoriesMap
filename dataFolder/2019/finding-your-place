Text: "A year and a half ago I had the fortune of knowing a great country, Canada,\
  \ with spectacular landscapes wherever I went, regardless of the season, whether\
  \ summer or winter. At that time I was working for a Mexican company dedicated to\
  \ moving, as well as accompanying students to international destinations during\
  \ short stays and my main function was to coordinate the logistics during that week.\n\
  \nNow, the first time that I traveled under that plan was to Toronto, an impressive\
  \ city with diverse activities and very cool attractions such as the CN Tower or\
  \ Toronto's Island; nearby, you can visit other regions such as the Niagara where\
  \ you can see besides the impressive waterfalls a nearby town called Niagara on\
  \ the Lake surrounded by Lake Ontario and famous for its vineyards along with a\
  \ product produced in a few countries: \"Icewine\".\n\nIt is worth mentioning the\
  \ following during these trips with the company did not have much time or freedom\
  \ to perform personal activities, either go to a neighborhood of my own interest\
  \ or even know the nightlife of the city due to the structure of the program.\n\
  This situation didn\u2019t worry me at all because I knew the responsibility in\
  \ my hands and I enjoyed that, I won\u2019t lie at the beginning I was scared, imagine\
  \ the situation: first time you leave the country, to an unknown destination in\
  \ charge of more than 40 people which most spoke only Spanish and learning to do\
  \ the job itself, pretty scary. It was an experience full of amazing adventures\
  \ also of some strange situations and others of emergency, but fortunately, nothing\
  \ that I couldn\u2019t control.\nThen I had the opportunity to know Montreal, a\
  \ city in which I spent almost two continuous months. I also traveled every week\
  \ to Ottawa and Quebec City where I found one of the most relaxing sensations: sitting\
  \ on the Dufferin terrace, in front of the Ch\xE2teau Frontenac hotel with the view\
  \ of the Saint Laurent river listening to street performances playing saxophone\
  \ or violin, a magical moment where I stopped thinking about everything and just\
  \ enjoyed.\n\nIt was during this period that I found myself navigating in a sea\
  \ of mixed feelings: on one hand, I was leading groups of students every week who,\
  \ I must admit, some of them were extraordinary people, they help me to have a splendid\
  \ week; however, I was falling into a monotonous lifestyle which didn\u2019t make\
  \ sense to what I was doing, because despite knowing the city and its surroundings\
  \ I felt powerless to not be able to visit places of my interest like bars, museums\
  \ or even any nearby mountain.\n\nSomething that helped me cope with this feeling\
  \ was knowing about my mother's family in Montreal, yes, as you read, we usually\
  \ have distant relatives of whom we don\u2019t know anything about them, well this\
  \ was one of those cases.\n\nDuring the first week of visiting the city, my mother\
  \ sent me a message, mentioning my aunt, \"check with her for the possibility of\
  \ meeting\". I contacted her and it was until the second week that we were able\
  \ to meet. It was a very weird feeling, I met my aunt Diana and my cousins Flor\
  \ and Jennifer, it was the first time we saw each other or even talked in our lives,\
  \ nevertheless, we had a great time and since then we\u2019ve maintained contact,\
  \ as well as trying to get together every time you were in the city.\n\nIn the end,\
  \ you could say that I developed a special bond with the city of Montreal due to\
  \ lifestyle, but the main reason was for the people I met as my aunt, my cousins,\
  \ and friends in the city so I am happy to have had the fortune of living that exceptional\
  \ experience and if I can be honest I'm seriously thinking of moving there but first\
  \ I need to know the world."
