Text: "Following the crowd had become a theme in my life and once again I found myself\
  \ following the crowd. We had just finished a conference at the MGM Grand Las Vegas\
  \ and over 5000 women had filled the main arena and were now leaving it. I was walking\
  \ with the crowd, enjoying the atmosphere of excited women and listening to the\
  \ optimism that now filled the air. 2015 was the year everything was going to change.\
  \ 2015 was the year to be \u201CUnstoppable\u201D. Anyhow that\u2019s what I and\
  \ all the women in the arena had decided. \n\nSoon enough I found myself outside\
  \ the MGM. We had decided earlier on, another walk down the strip was how we would\
  \ spend the rest of the hours left that night. The crowd dispersed as they poured\
  \ out into the side walk. I realised we were at the back of MGM. The sky was dark\
  \ and the air was warm. The now familiar odour of garbage filled my nose and brought\
  \ me back to reality. I looked around and realised that we had found ourselves in\
  \ the middle of the strip. We could cross over but we would be met with a ten foot\
  \ fence (this may not be the actual height but it definitely looked like it). The\
  \ small group I now found myself with, decided to walk along the fence on the road\
  \ and wait for a gap to try and get back to safety - the footpath. At this point\
  \ the strip now seemed busier than ever. I could hear shouts and screams. Laughter\
  \ and loud music. From the street I could feel the pulse of the city. Perhaps though\
  \ it wasn\u2019t the city\u2019s pulse but my own I felt pounding in my ears. My\
  \ heart was pounding so loudly now as I followed I think, about 12 people all walking\
  \ along the side of the road. The cars felt so close and the previous night of admiring\
  \ all the different luxury cars cruising the strip no longer appealed to me.\n\n\
  Finally we came to an escalator, otherwise known as \u2018the gap\u201D. One by\
  \ one each person jumped up, helped by two others to clamour up onto the wall then\
  \ jump down onto the footpath. I was petrified. How had I found myself in this position?\
  \ Why didn\u2019t I pay attention? Would I die on the streets of Las Vegas? Tupac\
  \ had been shot here and they never found his killer! Was this my fate? Silently\
  \ I said a prayer for my 4 young children, who I had left behind in Australia. Oh\
  \ and my husband! He was not allowed to remarry! With these last thoughts I jumped\
  \ up and was grabbed by both arms. Two complete strangers telling me it was ok and\
  \ I was almost there. With one last push I was up and over the other side. As my\
  \ feet hit the footpath the tears started to fall. The complete strangers who I\
  \ had just met, all shared the same relief. We had not become a statistic of the\
  \ strip. As I watched others being helped over (the group included a mother with\
  \ a baby in a pram!) I realised a part of me would be forever left in Vegas. \n\n\
  I began to see \u201CSin City\u201D as a \u201CCity of Redemption\u201D instead.\
  \ The many stories of people coming to this city to lose themselves was probably\
  \ one of the things that had prompted me to come. \u201CDisneyland for adults\u201D\
  \ my friend had told me and I had believed him. I realised that I had taken Vegas\u2019\
  \ promise of bright lights and fun very seriously. I had been very determined to\
  \ lose myself in this city but instead I had found myself. As I said goodbye to\
  \ the new friends I had just made, I took time to say goodbye to the girl I was\
  \ leaving behind, on the other side of the fence. I imagined she was lonely but\
  \ the ghosts of the strip would keep her company. With the promise of many adventures\
  \ and following the fun Vegas has to offer, I took the girl who jumped the fence\
  \ by the hand and headed towards the Bellagio."
