Text: "Losing direction is like quicksand. It would sink you deeply if you let it\
  \ in. That is how I feel - a 2nd-year university student, cramping books and writing\
  \ reports just for the sake of passing. \n But all it takes is a big leap of faith\
  \ and doing things differently. The turning point for me has to be my solo adventure\
  \ to Malaysia during the last spring break. \n The one thing that I didn\u2019t\
  \ expect to find the most out of carrying a 7-kg rucksack every day, making friends\
  \ with basically anyone on the street, trying out exotic foods, \u2026 (also known\
  \ as travel): myself!\n\n Coming to Malaysia, I did not know that I would encounter\
  \ so many people of different colors, all in the same land. Evan- a local friend\
  \ whom we met during a conference, took me on a day trip across Kuala Lumpur. It\
  \ was a rollercoaster ride for me, culturally. \n Our first destination was the\
  \ Buddhist Temple of Thean Hou, where I felt so belonged since I also followed Buddhism.\
  \ But that connection did not last very long as we reached our second destination:\
  \ Batu Caves. It was definitely the fastest cultural shock I ever experienced, only\
  \ 2-hour drive apart! \n Batu Caves is a Tamil shrine dedicated to the Hindu population\
  \ of Malaysia. It was so fascinating from praying Nam M\xF4 A Di \u0110\xE0 Ph\u1EAD\
  t (how Vietnamese Buddhist pray) at one part of the city to seeing people worshipping\
  \ Hindu\u2019s statues and paintings at another. What caught my attention was the\
  \ Hindu god of war- the big golden statue you would see first entering Batu Caves.\
  \ My \u201Ctrip to India\u201D was enhanced even further with Evan taking me to\
  \ have Banana Leave Rice. It was the staple and pride of Southern Indian cuisine.\
  \ Again, it was such eye-opening to have wise words of, closing the top leaf side\
  \ over the lower leaf after eating to pay respect, coming from a Chinese guy (Evan\
  \ is a Chinese-Malay).\n  My solo travel experience in Malaysia continued with me\
  \ going to the southern city of Melaka. There I met my generous and hospitable Couchsurfing\
  \ host: Fendi. Fendi was so kind that he offered me a free ride back from Melaka\
  \ to KL. I guess I did leave a good impression as I was \u201Cbehaved\u201D enough\
  \ to follow him on his praying day in Melaka. It was the hottest Friday afternoon\
  \ ever and every Muslim guy in town was flocking to the city mosque. Fendi told\
  \ me, with pride that every Friday is the Friday praying for men and all men stopped\
  \ working to go to church. I had the wonderful experience of seeing Muslims listen\
  \ to the Quar\u2019an and doing various steps of praying. Even though I was not\
  \ a Muslim, I could sense a state of tranquility overshadowing the mosque.\n\n I\
  \ said goodbye to Malaysia with big gratitude and appreciation. The stories I heard,\
  \ the experiences I had, and the friends I made in Malaysia, all made a mark in\
  \ my heart. So powerful and impactful was it that a desire to share them to the\
  \ world hit. With a hope that everyone would feel the same way that I felt, I had\
  \ found my way to writing, or more specifically, travel blogging.\n \u201CFind something\
  \ that gets you up in the morning,\u201D they said, but it\u2019s frustrating when\
  \ you are in the dark yourself. Has it ever occurred that it\u2019s because you\u2019\
  ve not experienced life enough? Travel does not directly lead me to my self-realization,\
  \ but it gives me the perfect space to reflect on myself and uncover other parts\
  \ that I am not aware of. After my trip to Malaysia, I discovered that I can express\
  \ myself through writing. I know that I have a lot to learn, but this is an amazing\
  \ start that pulls myself out of the quicksand that I mentioned earlier.\n  My story\
  \ starts with traveling. What about you?"
