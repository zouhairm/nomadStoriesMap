Text: "It all started in January 2016 when I had a dream that I was at the centre\
  \ of a square sorrounded by tall buildings.I saw myself standing in the middle of\
  \ the grounds feeling ecstatic that I was gracing the presence of a mighty kingdom.In\
  \ the vision, I walked majestically with unapologetic confidence through two huge\
  \ doors and then I woke up,only to realise it was a dream.Fast forward one year\
  \ later,I received a scholarship to study at Australian Catholic University's Rome\
  \ campus for a summer intensive unit.I was on cloud nine trying to contain my almost\
  \ exploding joy.Now,just to give you a bit of my background, I was born and bred\
  \ in Kenya,East Africa,in a family of staunch catholics,hence, growing up all I\
  \ heard was how Vatican was the host of Catholicism. \nMoreover,I have a strong\
  \ desire and quest to learn about other people's culture,way of life and being and\
  \ so it only made sense that I would end up in Italy.\nOn the 5th January,2017 I\
  \ rose up like a colonised nation about to get their independence, so ready to embark\
  \ on this journey of the unknown.It was truly a mixture of excitement and fear or\
  \ better yet a roller-coaster of emotions. I get on to the longest flight of my\
  \ life from Sydney to Dubai and then to Rome.On the first week of our stay in Rome\
  \ we learnt that we had an audience with Pope Francis at the Vatican auditorium.The\
  \ night prior,my sleep took a flight without me and I was hit by the insomnia that\
  \ accompanies you when your brain is boiling out chemicals of excitement.\nThe day\
  \ was here,the sun was shining shyly and I was excited to step out, however,my brain\
  \ had not yet registered that I was in Italy and not Australia and the sun was only\
  \ showing off but not showing up as it was in winter and it was freezing outside.I\
  \ dashed back to the hostel to grab the warmest coat I had and got on my long warm\
  \ boots.\nAs we approached the street that  separated Rome city with Vatican City,it\
  \ just hit me that I was in one country and by making few steps I was in another.That\
  \ was quite fascinating to be honest.Anyway,we are now walking torwards a long queue\
  \ for security checks and off we go to the Vatican church.As we got there,I looked\
  \ around and in a split second the vision I saw exactly one year ago materialised\
  \ before my eyes.I realised that in the vision I was actually standing in the middle\
  \ of St.Peter's Square in Vatican. I had never been there before or even seen images\
  \ of the place and that was so surreal. \nNow,like I mentioned before being brought\
  \ up in a catholic Church meant that my upbringing was shaped by a lot of it's teaching\
  \ and virtues and those beliefs in some way shape or form, shaped my identity,character\
  \ and even life goals.\nI remember getting closer and closer to the main doors of\
  \ the Vatican church and when we got there I saw this really huge,wide,dark wooden\
  \ doors open and as I made one step in I felt this sense of peace like I belonged\
  \ there.I remember just having tears down my cheeks and feeling blissful.\nIt was\
  \ as though I was glimpsing the unknown and at the same time,I was coming back home.\n\
  I walked in so slow as not to miss a beat,it felt as though I was meant to capture\
  \ every painting that Michelangelo had done on the ceilings,every sculpture enticed\
  \ me,every statue spoke to my soul,every detail on the floor was communicating in\
  \ a foreign language but yet I comprehended with clarity.\nMy next unreal moment\
  \ was watching Pope Francis stand next to me as he blessed people in the Vatican\
  \ auditorium,while making his way to the podium for a speech.\nAs I narrated my\
  \ experience in class the following day,my classmates were intrigued and one of\
  \ them shed tears of joy as she couldn't believe how being at the Vatican meant\
  \ to me while she stated all she wanted was to take some pictures and keep the memories.It\
  \ was truly a leap into unknown."
