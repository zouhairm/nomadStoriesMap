Text: "So I was in my travel days to Kasol, Himachal Pradesh, India (Snow Chain of\
  \ Mountains). I was accompanied by one friend of mine and we were on our trek to\
  \ the summit of Kheerganga Snow Mountain. Kheerganga is located deep in Parvati\
  \ Valley (Kullu Valley) and is perched at an altitude of approximately 2950m.one\
  \ can take a private Volvo bus that leaves from Majnu Ka Tila or Rama Krishna Ashram\
  \ Metro Station in Delhi. A recommended and timely option is taking the HRTC Himsuta\
  \ Volvo that leaves from ISBT Kashmere Gate. All the Volvos from Delhi leave in\
  \ the evening and reach Bhuntar at around 5 am to 7 am in the morning. Bhuntar is\
  \ the village from where the road diverges for Parvati Valley, it is also the confluence\
  \ point of Beas River with Parvati River. Ask the bus to drop you near the Bhuntar\
  \ bus stand from where you have to catch a bus to Barshaini. Barshaini comes after\
  \ Kasol, Manikaran and is the last motorable road in the valley. Buses from Bhuntar\
  \ to Barshaini are frequent and the distance is usually covered in approx. 2-3 hours.\
  \ It is better to have breakfast in Bhuntar while waiting for the bus.Around 45\
  \ mins before reaching Kheerganga, there is a beautiful view of a flowing waterfall\
  \ on the path itself. There are two very scenic caf\xE9s with gorgeous views here.\
  \ In case accommodation is not available at Kheerganga, one can sleep in the common\
  \ space for a small charge.\n\nWhen you\u2019ve walked and walked, the path will\
  \ wind one final time and the first of the yellow and blue tarpaulin covered huts\
  \ can be seen. This is the start of Kheerganga, there is a cluster of huts and caf\xE9\
  s near the temple and natural hot water spring which can be covered on a 10 minute\
  \ walk. The temple and hot water spring pool is located on top of all the huts and\
  \ campsites.Where to stay in Kheerganga? : Kheerganga has become a very popular\
  \ destination for young adventurers during the summer months. There are around 8-10\
  \ huts offering rudimentary staying facilities in Kheerganga. Depending on the season,\
  \ weekend crowds and whether \u2013 it is easy to find accommodation in Kheerganga\
  \ even if you haven\u2019t booked in advance. There are options of private huts\
  \ and rooms for couples at 400-500 Rupees per room. Common sleeping space is available\
  \ (a comfortable bed and blanket) at around 100-200 Rs. per person. Remember that\
  \ the bathrooms are mostly shared ones and it is almost impossible to find a room\
  \ with an attached bathroom. While it is possible to trek to Kheerganga almost throughout\
  \ the year, in peak winters the path may be snowed out and the tents and other accommodation\
  \ options may not be available. During off-season enquire beforehand from the villagers\
  \ of Barshaini & Nakthan, with regards to the same. Basic idea of the costs for\
  \ trek to Kheerganga: Volvo tickets from Delhi to Bhuntar & back \u2013 2000/-.\
  \ Bhuntar to Barshaini (to & fro) \u2013 200/-. Stay at Kheerganga (or other villages)\
  \ \u2013 200 per day. Food is expensive \u2013 Rs. 500 per day. It's a must visit\
  \ place. Forgot to tell you that my friend and I even lost our way while on the\
  \ trek of Kheerganga and we almost had an encounter with a bear in the deep forest\
  \ of the mountains, where climbing up. The forest was so dense that even moonlight\
  \ couldn't touch the ground...but we made it somehow. I won..lol\nSo that was a\
  \ memorable moment.\nSee you guess on the other side of the world...Adios !!!"
