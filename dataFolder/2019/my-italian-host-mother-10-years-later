Text: "I heard my name being called when I got off the train in Umbria.  A well-dressed\
  \ woman in her seventies, a little hunched over, with celeste colored eye shadow\
  \ and a bright green hand bag emerged from the crowd on the platform. She was visibly\
  \ fatigued from her efforts to identify me. \n\u201CJordan! Jordan!\u201D she continued\
  \ at the air.  \n\tShe hadn\u2019t remembered me when I called and didn\u2019t recognize\
  \ me either. After reminding her who I was on the phone, she had invited me to visit\
  \ her country home Citta delle Pieve. Unlike the first time I\u2019d met her when\
  \ my Italian was non-existent, we were able to converse easily. She took me to lunch\
  \ in the center of town. \n\u201CThis is my student.\u201D Carla announced dramatically\
  \ to the trattoria. \u201CShe is a famous writer in Rome.\u201D A collection of\
  \ friends from town looked at me in awe. \nThe first statement was true. Carla hosted\
  \ me in her home 10 years ago during my study abroad semester in Florence. She had\
  \ defined my experience in Italy. She was the first contact I had with the language,\
  \ the food, and with many of the delights and peculiarities of the culture. She\
  \ was exuberant in her speech, waving her hands in indecipherable gestures as she\
  \ talked, looking upwards at the ceiling. She prepared foods so rich that the smells\
  \ wafted out into the street. She was passionate in both her love and disapproval\
  \ a behavior she modeled in her relationship with her yappy Jack Russel Terrier,\
  \ Napoleon.\n I completely fell for the bella vita during that time. Never had I\
  \ eaten so well nor passed my days so enjoyably, studying Renaissance art and strolling\
  \ the streets with my American friends. Each night I returned home to a Tuscan meal\
  \ prepared by Carla.\nThe second part of her speech at lunch was less true. I had\
  \ returned to Italy to live as an adult and had been in Rome for two years. Far\
  \ from fame, my life hadn\u2019t felt nearly as inspiring as it had during my cushy\
  \ four month stay at her place. \n Adult life in Rome was a completely different\
  \ reality. My efforts to establish myself legally, economically and socially had\
  \ zapped my energy and enthusiasm for creative pursuits. I found myself frequently\
  \ doubting my choice to move altogether. But, every time someone asked me why I\
  \ had decided to move to Italy, Carla came to mind. I finally decided to get in\
  \ touch. Luckily, my study abroad university still had her landline number on file.\
  \   \n\tLater, after lunch, she probed about my love life. I talked about the frustrations\
  \ of cross-cultural dating and how, so far, Italian men had failed to live up to\
  \ their romantic reputations. \n\u201CWell, I think that love is universal,\u201D\
  \ she said. I remembered thinking how such a statement was hard to argue with.\n\
  The next day we went to Montepulciano, a Tuscan village known for its red wine production.\
  \ I feared for my life as we took windy short cuts through gravel roads along vineyards.\
  \ She gripped the wheel tightly and held her face close to the dashboard as she\
  \ drove.\n\u201CI\u2019ll just have a little wine at lunch,\u201D she said. \u201C\
  That way I can still drive back.\u201D I nodded, slightly nervous and amused.  \n\
  Back in Citta delle Pieve Carla shared some poetry she\u2019d written. Out of a\
  \ kitchen drawer she presented a collection of poems, \u201CPensieri di una Casalinga.\u201D\
  \ \nThe writing revealed deep reflections on the life of a stay-at-home Italian\
  \ mother and wife, parts of her I hadn\u2019t heard about. She read with vigor poems\
  \ about the pain of young widowhood, as well as the joys and sorrows of raising\
  \ two sons.\nAt that moment I realized that what had inspired me about Carla, more\
  \ than her cooking or any of her eccentricities, was her authenticity. She was fearless\
  \ in her display of vulnerability. I was beginning to understand that the dreamy\
  \ illusions I\u2019d gathered about life in Italy were of my own making. \nVisiting\
  \ Carla reminded me that life is beautiful not just because we are in Italy, but\
  \ because life has a way of always giving us something to write about."
