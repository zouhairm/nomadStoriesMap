Text: "Travelling has it own advantages. Feeling I had to know my country and every\
  \ counties with in it and our cultural activities, I decided to make used of every\
  \ opportunities that comes my way in other to know how my fellow county men react\
  \ to strangers or different tribal group. I live in Monrovia, which is the capital\
  \ city of Liberia. \nI visited Buchanan, Grand Bassa, my county of origin I connected\
  \ easily with the people there because we are of the same tribe, I was treated well\
  \ and I enjoyed been there.\nI also visited few other counties and their hospitality\
  \ was very different from that of what I received from my county. When I was in\
  \ Gbargna, the people the was so excited to see me and I received a great welcome,\
  \ they respected my as their fellow country man. They wanted me to be part of their\
  \ cultural lives, like joining our native society and becoming member of the tribe.\
  \ These people believe so much in agriculture. \nMy trip to Bopolu, Gbarpolu was\
  \ not great, the people there behave as strange as you the stranger, no good welcome\
  \ and everybody is busy with activities as if you was there since your childhood,\
  \ they don't actually care about strangers. These people live like they are in the\
  \ capital city of Liberia while stranger are like those from the interior part of\
  \ the country. Travelling to that part of Liberia is stressful because of the lack\
  \ of good roads, people get down from the cars to get to some villages along the\
  \ roads.\nThe best welcome and hospitality I ever received on mi trip was in Yakapa,\
  \ Nimbia. The people are so nice that you will want to live the rest of your live\
  \ with these people. The city has a varies of different tribal group which help\
  \ in the process of making it one of the best place to live. The city never sleeps\
  \ and love is all over. But they are very traditional people who believe and worship\
  \ gods and perform witchcraft act. Ritual are done there for riches, wives, husbands\
  \ and families.\nConnecting with the locals help you understand your culture and\
  \ how people welcome stranger or visitor. I have experienced live on the road as\
  \ it impacted me in a great way.\nTravelling is a way of knowing hiding things."
