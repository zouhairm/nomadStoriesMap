Text: "I was 14 when I took my first trip outside of my city and it was in Cape Town\
  \ where I learned to appreciate food. Me and my cousin were visiting her older sister\
  \ who was a post graduate at the University of Cape Town. The tedious bus ride from\
  \ Johannesburg Park station was about 14 hours long. I remember gnawing through\
  \ the window at key objects me and my cousin found interesting, she became responsible\
  \ of taking note of each and everything on a piece of tissue paper, from rivers\
  \ that seemed like they stretched across borders, to strange looking rocks in certain\
  \ parts of the Northern Cape and finally, the idea of feeling like we were starring\
  \ in a cow boy and rock and roll orientated movie because of the dry, quaint and\
  \ dated looking towns the bus drove through, quite an experience.\n\nArriving in\
  \ Obsevartory which was our stay for the entire trip, we settled in and took our\
  \ first deep breaths of the nature driven and affluent city of Cape Town. More than\
  \ anything, that is what stood out about Cape Town, how clean, posh and immaculate\
  \ the streets looked, how the Table Mountain always found a way to make itself seen,\
  \ bold, beautiful and massively huge. It seemed even more profound in the mornings\
  \ when the mist hogged each and every corner of the mountain. Speaking of the mountains,\
  \ our first outdoor adventure was hiking, and it took place at the University of\
  \ Cape Town. The activity pulled out of me - grit, annoyance, the art of patience,\
  \ definitely heavy breathing and funny enough, the ability to have the urge to stop\
  \ for a minute, to take in a moment. Wait, before riveting up the mountain and upon\
  \ arriving at the campus, we got to choose sandwiches from a small vendor beside\
  \ the main building and I could remember this because it was one of the worst sandwiches\
  \ I had ever had. It seemed like it was sensitive to the wind and Cape Town is absolutely\
  \ common with abnormally cold breezes. Upon arriving at the top of the mountain\
  \ with the sandwiches in our hands, the cheese was all of a sudden rubber and the\
  \ tomatoes were sullen. The bread was just incredibly dry. There goes our lunch,\
  \ I for one could not finish my sandwich.\n\nWhat is a trip to Cape Town without\
  \ the beach? A mediocre one that is. Me and my cousin had the pleasure of visiting\
  \ the Camps Bay beach during our travel. I remember the long walk we took the train\
  \ station and how hungry I was throughout the entire struggle. The irony of it all\
  \ is how frantic my aunt seemed when it came to packing lunchboxes for the trip,\
  \ it was only when we got to the beach that I was not sure about what I was anticipating,\
  \ the eating part or collecting shells. Again, only when I took a bite of the panini\
  \ bread was when the glee on my face instantly faded to dust. I realized that it\
  \ was again one of the potential foods to have been the worst I've had during the\
  \ trip. Chasing waves, building sand castles and scribbling my crush's name on the\
  \ salty sand was not as exciting and heart throbbing when I acknowledged how I did\
  \ not enjoy the eating part of the entire experience. \n\nCape Town is generally\
  \ a cold city and visiting the beach was basically being at the peak of the ice\
  \ land. I think that whole notion was clearly reflected on a picture of me and my\
  \ cousin cringing at the breeze with ice - cream in our hands. Which lead to us\
  \ running toward the next train back home, as we could not stand the wood cutting\
  \ coldness that came with being at Camps Bay for just a few hours. Arriving home\
  \ to a supper consisting of greenery, turkey and white substances was my last straw\
  \ when it came to my visit to Cape Town. I told myself that, in terms of traveling,\
  \ I would never ever compromise on good food, especially if it is one's first time\
  \ in a new and vibrant city like Cape Town."
