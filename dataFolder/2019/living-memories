Text: "It was finally happening! I was traveling to England! Besides the usual excitement\
  \ of any trip to a different country, England was always a enchanted land to me.\
  \ I grew up listening my parents telling stories about that far away country, where\
  \ they met and got married before my elder brother was born. To a child - or even\
  \ an adult - everything about that place seemed magical and fascinating. The seasons\
  \ were all switched, the glass in the windows were swirled, temperatures could go\
  \ below zero degrees and, during a time of the year, the sun would set in the middle\
  \ of the afternoon. Blame it on my parents' tone when they talked about there, the\
  \ way our voice shifts when we talk about something we miss; or maybe on the painting\
  \ on the living room, my mother was never too tired to answer us when we asked what\
  \ was that. \n\"It is a pub we used to go with some very dear friends near where\
  \ we lived.\" \nAlong the years, many of these dear friends went visiting us in\
  \ Brazil, taking tea and biscuits made with fruits and herbs we have only heard\
  \ about, speaking in a different language, full of sounds we could barely understand.\
  \ Some of them ended up being very present in our childhood, like a favorite uncle\
  \ that once in a while would come and create all those new memories with us. England,\
  \ then, was the place all of them lived, and my imagination could only go wilder\
  \ and wilder when I thought about how would be the home of those people so different\
  \ than me and all I had around.\nSo yes, I was curious and excited. I've been that\
  \ way my entire life. \nWe would get there in the beginning of the fall, no snow\
  \ or temperatures below zero, but that made no difference for me. I was finally\
  \ going to taste that place I knew from stories, movies and pictures. \nWe landed\
  \ in Heathrow and went straight to St. Albans, a small town not far from London,\
  \ where my parents lived. I recognized some streets from the old lithographs we\
  \ had hanging on the wall for many years; also my father pointed out some places,\
  \ mentioning the pictures we had back home. Somehow, I knew those streets. I constantly\
  \ had that familiarity feeling on my feet, while I had so much amazement on my eyes.\
  \ \nBy the third day, we went for lunch. It was going to be this big reunion of\
  \ the long time no see friends, and many of them were going to meet me for the first\
  \ time, after more then two decades. Some others I could only try to remember, while\
  \ my father kept telling me the time one or another went to visit us and we exchanged\
  \ words, finding out our languages could have some similarities. \nSo we got in\
  \ the car and drove till the parking lot, coincidently meeting a share of the group\
  \ over there. Hugs and cheering, the group started to walk towards the meeting place,\
  \ while already trying to catch up the news. Walking on the sidewalk, we were passing\
  \ in front of a front yard, carefully maintained, with green grass, some stones\
  \ and colorful flowers. And then, just as I was kinda left aside of all the talk,\
  \ my head turned and I saw the building. It was The Three Hammers, that building!\
  \ The very one we had on our wall for more than twenty years. My feet stopped while\
  \ my jaw was dropped. I could barely blink while my eyes were trying to catch every\
  \ possible detail, the brick walls, the many chimneys, and the pointy tainted roof\
  \ tops. I was mesmerized to see through the windows some figures moving inside the\
  \ place. It was alive!\nAnd then I realized the entire group was standing, waiting\
  \ for me, trying to figure out why I was so behind. My father wasn't so surprised,\
  \ but still he was waiting some explanation. And I could only say \"there is no\
  \ frame around it!\"."
