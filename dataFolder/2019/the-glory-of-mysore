Text: "To perfectly describe Mysore/Mysuru  - It definitely seems like a portal to\
  \ History and Back in Time !!\n\nMysore is  Grand, Historic and Mystical ! The whole\
  \ time I was there, I was in complete awe of how such monuments and people existed\
  \ back in time . Mysore being the earlier province of Karnataka, holds great significance\
  \ for the people here .\n\nUnlike any other major cities in India , Mysore still\
  \ reflects most of its Architecture, Culture, Work, Food and People as back in the\
  \ time of Kings and Queens .\n\nMysore is visited by both locals and travelers from\
  \ around the world for its Majestic Monuments, The Great History, Festivals, Food\
  \ and Nature! It could be everything you can make of it .\n\nNow, Mysore is located\
  \ in the Southern part of Karnataka , close to the capital - Bengaluru . And there\
  \ are loads of places to see in Mysore and in a close distance from it.\n\nWHAT\
  \ TO SEE :  \n\n Even though Mysore is not vast in area, there are loads of attractions\
  \ in and around Mysore .  \n\nMysore Palace :   \n\nOf course the palace was my\
  \ first priority !! The home of the Wadiyars Built around 600 years ago ; has immense\
  \ history and beauty to it. It is like travelling back in time and Re-living those\
  \ moments !! The Palace has two parts - The Residential Building (Built 600 years\
  \ ago) and The Main Building (Built 100 years ago) . I emphasis to check out both\
  \ of them for complete history !!  \n\n\nChamudeshwari Temple -\n\nThe temple dedicated\
  \ to Parvati; is situated on top of the Chamundi Hills . It is Lush and covered\
  \ in Nature and is a must visit to pay your respects one who visits Mysore! It is\
  \ divine and a calming experience in total . Also visit the Nandi Temple in the\
  \ Foot hill of Chamudi Hills while coming back. It is believed to be Monolithic\
  \ structure of the bull (carrier of Lord Shiva) .\n\n\nMelody World Wax Museum -\
  \  \n\nIt has a world record for largest collection of authentic musical instruments\
  \ from around the world !! Not very time consuming but it is very interesting to\
  \ see some musical instruments and old electronics !\n\n\nSand Museum -  \n\nArtists\
  \ carved beautiful sculptures on sand and mud depicting Indian Mythology and so\
  \ much more . Definitely worth a visit. \n\n\nShuka Vana - \n\nHome to Exotic Birds\
  \ like - Parrots , Parakeets, Cockatoos and more!! Sukha vana is a must visit and\
  \ its free !! You will witness some of the amazing and adorable people friendly\
  \ birds . It is all enclosed in an Ashram which also you can take a tour of .\n\n\
  \nBonsai Gardens - \n\nIn the same Ashram , you can also find Bonsai Gardens well\
  \ maintained . There are more than 100 trees/bonsai which you can stroll through\
  \ after watching the birds . (Entry fee applicable) \n\n\nLalitha Mahal -\n\nOne\
  \ of the Oldest Heritage Hotels in Mysore , Lalitha Mahal definitely holds some\
  \ History and lots of beauty. Located amidst nature , it is perfect to experience\
  \ some royalty . We visited the Mahal for Lunch and spent the afternoon there !\
  \  \n\n\nJaganmohan Art Gallery - \n\nHome to one of the most famous painters of\
  \ India - Ravivarma ; this art gallery holds some of the priceless paintings of\
  \ him and other great artists . Some belonged to the Mysore Palace which were later\
  \ shifted in the Gallery . This place is a much visit for Art and Literature lovers!!\
  \ \n\n\nSt. Philomena's Cathedral -  \n\nThis church is a Roman Catholic Church\
  \ depicting Neo-Gothic style architecture built in the year 1936 . This is one of\
  \ the most iconic places in Mysore as it tells very much about history and its marvelous\
  \ architecture .  \n\n\nTipu Sultan Summer Palace - \n\nThis was one of my favorite\
  \ places in Mysore !! All credits to its beautiful interiors and just the feel of\
  \ royal-ness . This palace is located in Srirangapatna ( 20 km ) from Mysore . And\
  \ is definitely worth the visit !! Make sure to visit Mayura Riverside Restaurant\
  \ near Tippu Summer Palace for an afternoon lunch or snacks and drinks !! \n\n\n\
  Balmuri Waterfalls - \n\nLocated just near the Tippu Sultan Summer Palace , is the\
  \ Balmuri Waterfalls by river Kaveri . It is definitely one of the most relaxing\
  \ places to visit in Mysore.\n\nMysore has been one of my favorite places in  South\
  \ India to visit ! I hope this inspired you to head towards Mysore soon :) \n\n\
  HAPPY TRAVELS !!"
