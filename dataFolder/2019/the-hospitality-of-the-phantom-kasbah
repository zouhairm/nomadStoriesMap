Text: "Kasbah's valley is known like a magic place but we didn't expect that magic.\
  \ Walking outside the city of Agdz we found ourselves into a vast palm forest with\
  \ very tidy vegetable gardens in the fresh shadow of the tall palms. It was that\
  \ moment of the day when light and dark meet, when time is losing its consistency\
  \ and even matter starts to follow other dimension's rules. Silence all over, just\
  \ wind and birds singing their melodies.\nExactly like many stories of magic where\
  \ an unexpected guide lead to Wonderland, a white rabbit appeared in front of us,\
  \ with the shape of a pick up, and drove us through the palm sea.\nHe left us at\
  \ the bottom of an old kasbah. Like old castle's ruins, Taliouine appeared totally\
  \ abandoned since many years. Keeping the sacred silence we walked all the way up.\
  \ Even bird were no longer whistling. Cob buildings, a third of them collapsed,\
  \ windows and doors without frames, rocks, wires, dust.\nWe finally got into the\
  \ \"main square\". A little open area in the heart of the kasbah and at the first\
  \ step into the square everything suddenly changed. We felt watched. Many widen\
  \ eyes came out from the darkness, voices approaching and an hand touching my shoulder!\n\
  In just a moment we were surrounded by 20 people, talking to us, gestures and loud\
  \ words to be better understood, but we didn't. The result was the caos.\nI think\
  \ smile is one of the global expressions, common for everyone, so we smiled and\
  \ Indeed it worked perfectly, immediately the whole kasbah was miraculously alive\
  \ again and was laughing.\nThanks God, and i still have to choose which one, in\
  \ the group there was a young girl speaking English so we had the possibility to\
  \ communicate more precisely. \nEven though was impossible to talk in that caos\
  \ and even without knowing Berber we understood that they were trying to invite\
  \ us somewhere, instinctively we said yesand started to follow the elder woman.\
  \ She brought us in an area nearby with just  bamb\xF9 cane as roof, we figured\
  \ out that was the kitchen: three small fireplaces on the ground, few big pots and\
  \ some wood tools. We seated on the floor and the rest of the big family gathered\
  \ around. All of them seemed very enthusiastic and curious, from young kids to old\
  \ women, it was amazing to have all of them so close that we could see ourselves\
  \ in their eyes.\nImmediately Grandma gave us soups and a special plate of local\
  \ dates. The situation, more calm now, was perfect for Fatima to translate the river\
  \ of questions that we were asking each other. The real connection between two different\
  \ cultures, unique and precious moment, no bad intentions, no judgements, just pure\
  \ sharing of customs and traditions, habits and daily life. What are people doing\
  \ in your country? In what are they believing? How are they behaving? Even differencies\
  \ were bounding us closer and closer. I felt part of the family when they invented\
  \ us at home, in the common sala. There, sitting barefoot on the carpet, admiring\
  \ their evening pray, playing with Taha, two weeks old, the last born, exactly there,\
  \ in the middle of nowhere, i felt home, i felt part of something bigger, i felt\
  \ part of the whole humanity. Till now, 2 years later, that one is the most meaningful\
  \ travel experience I've ever lived.\nThe evening went perfectly on. We kept speaking\
  \ and playing, they prepared a room for us and we slept there. That night i fell\
  \ asleep hearing the night pray from the loud speakers of the minaret. Early in\
  \ the morning we had to leave, Marrakech was waiting for us at 12 and we were in\
  \ the most alive phantom Kasbah I've ever been, 400 km far away. Fatima wanted to\
  \ cook us the amazing traditional breakfast: black coffe, olives, dates, honey and\
  \ msemen with jam. \nLeaving that place wasn't easy, without nothing more than \"\
  Thanks\" and gratitude in the eyes to express the love we felt and I'm feeling writing\
  \ theese few words."
