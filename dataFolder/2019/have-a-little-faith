Text: "You must have heard the saying \u201CTravel is the only thing you buy that\
  \ makes you richer\u201D; and while that might be a cliche, I would one hundred\
  \ percent agree with that statement. \nBack in 2015 I decided to pack up and make\
  \ my biggest dream a reality, I moved to London on my own, without any notion as\
  \ to what the future would hold. All I really knew was that I wanted an adventure,\
  \ I wanted to explore, and I wanted to figure out what it was that I wanted to do\
  \ with my life; basically my own \u201CEat, Pray, Love\u201D. \n\nI had been there\
  \ on a trip once before, so I knew the city a little bit already, but living there\
  \ entirely was a whole different story. I never expected to have a place feel more\
  \ like home than my actual home. I was never keen on living in a big city, but London\
  \ is such a vibrant, diverse place it feels like you\u2019re living in multiple\
  \ different cities instead of one. It was definitely a learning curve, and the experience\
  \ definitely tested me in many ways, but isn\u2019t that exactly what solo travel\
  \ is about? \n\nAt almost every job interview I went to, I always got asked the\
  \ question \u201Cwhat would you say is your greatest achievement?\u201D or \u201C\
  what are you most proud of?\u201D and at first I really had to think about it, what\
  \ was I most proud of? In my short life, what had I done so far that truly stuck\
  \ out to me? And as I was trying to think of the answer to this question, in a different\
  \ country, a different continent, it hit me! This, being here in London, this was\
  \ my greatest accomplishment. The fact that I had a dream, I did everything in my\
  \ power to make it happen, and actually accomplished it. I moved to London on my\
  \ own, with no job, no friends, and no place to live. Fast forward through the time\
  \ spent there, and I have made friendships with people all over the world that will\
  \ last a lifetime. I moved into a house with people I didn\u2019t know, and they\
  \ became my family. I have had adventures in places that I only ever dreamed of.\
  \ I had the amazing opportunity to be able to work in many different places and\
  \ industries, ultimately exposing me to the industry I want to work in and giving\
  \ me an entirely new dream to strive for. And all of that happened because of me!\
  \ I made it happen, and for someone who hasn\u2019t always necessarily been completely\
  \ confident in their own abilities, that was a truly amazing feeling. \n\nI was\
  \ in search of a career path and on that journey I found a place that I have never\
  \ felt more myself in. I found a confidence that I never thought I would find. I\
  \ have more faith in myself and my abilities than I ever thought I would and that\
  \ is worth more than anything money could buy me (except maybe my own private jet)."
