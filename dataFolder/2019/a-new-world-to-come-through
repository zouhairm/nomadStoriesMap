Text: "What if going through the daily bound routine of life your heart wants a break\
  \ and you start to ponder what do you know about yourself same was the question\
  \ I came through so in order to find myself I started to focus on myself tried to\
  \ know what pleases me and what not but when their is choas in surrounding how can\
  \ listen to voice of your heart, the questions that are unanswered residing in your\
  \ unconscious so I tried to find a peaceful place inorder to answer the questions\
  \ in my mind and travelling was the best option for me to fullfil this task. I convinced\
  \ my family as being a brown girl you have to gain permission through a whole session\
  \ of round table conference by your family.\nWhen finally they granted me permission\
  \ I was there in the valleys where birds sing songs for you instead of some pop\
  \ music by artists , the nature communicates with you , where the peace around engulfes\
  \ you in a soothing embrace. I travelled to the valley of Gilgit baltistan , going\
  \ through the lush green valleys of skardu. The valley was lush green with beautiful\
  \ lakes and to my surprise dessert was also there like who could have thought there\
  \ would be a dessert in a place of glaciers\n But the nature aims to surprise you.\
  \ The road to skardu was rough and dangerous but as my father says \" beauty demands\
  \  a tribute\" . The rough journey seemed nothing when we arrived at the lush place\
  \ of passu. A perfect place for meditation I would recommend as a psychologist.\
  \ The world around me was so quiet and peaceful that my inner voice was heard by\
  \ me. I stood there closing my eyes listening to what my heart had for me the questions\
  \ that bothered me in the middle of busy day started to make sense. The soothing\
  \ wind touched my face calming me to the core . Yes nature reminds you of what you\
  \ are . I was more then relaxed and when we entered the main city skardu it was\
  \ a whole city of young and livily people . What a culture they have and especially\
  \ being a foody I loved the taste their firstly their was a taste for my soul then\
  \ the taste for my appetite and both were wonderful. \nI loved the city that still\
  \ has my cherished memories and an unforgettable part of my memory ."
