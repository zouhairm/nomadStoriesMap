Text: "The last Cercan\xEDas train leaves Madrid\u2019s Atocha station at midnight.\
  \  The public washroom closes at eleven.  Half asleep and tipsy, I realize how desperately\
  \ I need a bathroom.  The climbing backpack usually carried with ease feels heavy\
  \ on my shoulders.  The station guard in unsympathetic.  Eight minutes until the\
  \ train leaves, no bathroom nearby; there is no choice but to endure the fifty-minute\
  \ ride through Spanish suburbia praying I do not pee my pants.\nIt was a long day.\
  \  I left my flat in Alcal\xE1 de Henares at six in the morning and spent the day\
  \ romping and climbing with a local friend in La Pedriza, a natural park on the\
  \ southern slopes of the Guadarrama mountains with magical granite outcrops.  La\
  \ Pedriza is rock that embodies epic adventure, think Charlton Heston in \u201C\
  El Cid\u201D and Arnold Schwarzenegger in \u201CConan the Barbarian,\u201D just\
  \ two movies to film in the park.  I was excited to have my turn playing in the\
  \ rocks.  But climbing in La Pedriza is hard.  There is a saying: to climb in La\
  \ Pedriza, you need \u201CPedriza faith\u201D because the walls are so flat all\
  \ there is to climb on is friction and faith.  We left the park around seven and\
  \ went to my friend\u2019s apartment for pizza and beers.  The climbing, too little\
  \ sleep, and speaking Spanish all day took its toll on me, but I was happy. \nWe\
  \ pull into Alcal\xE1.  Of course, the washroom is closed.  I exit the station and\
  \ my heart sinks at the sight of the empty taxi line.  The flat I\u2019m staying\
  \ in is a forty-five-minute walk away.  My phone is dead so I cannot call an Uber.\
  \  I am dreaming of bed and desperate for a bathroom.  The nightguard wanders around\
  \ the deserted station, harsh artificial lights accentuating every wrinkle on his\
  \ face.  He pays no attention to the small girl with the large backpack.  The guard\
  \ at Atocha left a bitter taste in my mouth, but I approach this guard and ask him\
  \ to call a taxi for me.  He is friendly and happily obliges.\nAfter calling the\
  \ taxi, I hope he will let me sit in silence.  I am uninterested in making small\
  \ talk at this early hour.  But he notices the climbing shoes hanging off my backpack\
  \ and asks me where I had spent my day?  We start talking and he hells me anecdotes\
  \ about his younger days climbing on his own Pedriza faith. He remembers one of\
  \ the lines I climbed, \u201CSur Clasico\u201D and compliments my ability.  I am\
  \ trying not to pee.  \u201CI\u2019m too old to climb in La Pedriza now, so I let\
  \ my faith take me to Santiago\u201D he recalls wistfully.  The conversation turns\
  \ to the Camino de Santiago, or Way of Saint James, a pilgrimage undertaken since\
  \ the dark ages m in the north of Spain that ends in Santiago de Compostela.  He\
  \ pulls out his cracked cellphone and shows me pictures from the Camino, pictures\
  \ of people he walked with: a girl from Germany, a man from Andaluc\xEDa.  He shows\
  \ me landscapes and scenery, lush greens and beautiful cities; even the albergues\
  \ in which he stayed.  The guard is so genuine in this moment, he insists I must\
  \ do the Camino at least once.  This guard was not the first person to talk about\
  \ the Camino with me.  It had come up at post-climb beers the week before.  Almost\
  \ every climber I met intended to make the pilgrimage themselves at some point;\
  \ some soon to \u201Cdiscover themselves\u201D and some when they retired and had\
  \ time to \u201Cconnect with the Way\u201D.  But what is so compelling about the\
  \ trek to Compostela, or further, to Finisterre and Muxia?  Why does every pilgrim\
  \ want to write their own account of the pilgrimage?  \nIt seemed to me the only\
  \ method to understand the draw of the Camino was to walk it myself.  So now I pack\
  \ a backpack much heavier than the black climbing bag the nightguard noticed.  I\
  \ am ready to cross the Pyrenees, another set of Spanish mountains I have so loved\
  \ to climb.  Maybe this will be my true epic adventure; the kind I can write poetry\
  \ about upon my return."
