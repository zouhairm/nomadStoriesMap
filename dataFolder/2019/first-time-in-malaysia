Text: "If anyone asked you to say something about Malaysia, what would you say? A\
  \ year ago, I knew about some island called Borneo, some airport in Kuala Lumpur\
  \ and something about an advert \u201CMalaysia Truly Asia\u201D. I knew that these\
  \ places existed, but that\u2019s about it! In reality, I cannot say much because\
  \ I know so little unless I have experienced it! \nSince there are many public holidays\
  \ in May, I was send by Malaysia Airlines for a 10 day sponsorship tour to write\
  \ about the harvest festivals. My first flight was from London to Kuala Lumpur and\
  \ then from Kuala Lumpur to Kota Kinabalu, where I attended the Kamataan festival.\n\
  Kamataan is a harvest festival celebrated annually for all of the month of May in\
  \ Sabah. On the 30\u201331 May, the festival concludes with a newly crowned Unduk\
  \ Ngadau Kaamatan. I got the possibility to attend the beauty pageant in KDCA hall,\
  \ because this year the host district was in Kota Kinabalu and believe me, all the\
  \ finalists were really, really beautiful! But if you are going to Kamataan and\
  \ you think the locals celebrate the festival everywhere and anywhere, you\u2019\
  re wrong. The only place where you can drink the rice wine (which by the way is\
  \ 40% alc. by volume), sing karaoke, eat and drink for friendly prices, that\u2019\
  s in the KDCA hall. \nFor those who are really interested in culture, history and\
  \ traditions of local people, you definitely should make a stop in Mari Mari cultural\
  \ village. The space is inside the jungle so you can better imagine how the tribes\
  \ used to live in Malaysia many years ago. For example, did you know that the tribes\
  \ were making vests from wood which protected them from the poisoned arrows? Or\
  \ if a woman wanted to marry, she had to make a fire from bamboo and the man had\
  \ to hunt an animal and hang it on the wall?\nAs more harvest celebrations took\
  \ place in Borneo, I moved to the northwest part of the island, to Sarawak. Surprisingly,\
  \ the festival didn\u2019t take place in centeral Kuching as I expected, but in\
  \ the small village (about 60 km behind the city) Annah Rais Longhouse.\nTo give\
  \ you a better insight as to why the locals are celebrating Gawai festival at this\
  \ time, I made a short interview with one of the habitant, Mata Kanay. \nGawai Dayak\
  \ is an annual festival celebrated by the Dayak people in Sarawak on 31 May and\
  \ 1 June. It is a public holiday in Sarawak and is both a religious and a social\
  \ occasion celebrated since 1965. The British colonial government refused to recognize\
  \ Dayak Day until 1962. They called it \u201CSarawak Day\u201D, it was a national\
  \ day, regardless of ethnic origin. Two years later \u201CSarawak Day\u201D was\
  \ gazetted as a public holiday acknowledging the formation of the Federation of\
  \ Malaysia. For locals the festival became a symbol of unity, aspiration and hope.\
  \ Mata Kanay explained to me the underlying meaning of Gawai. Nowadays, for locals\
  \ it is a Thanksgiving Day marking a bountiful harvest and a time to plan for the\
  \ new farming season. All families of the village meet up, decorate the village,\
  \ prepare the traditional food and celebrate together. He told me, that few years\
  \ ago they celebrated the festivals with locals only, without any outsiders but\
  \ now some of the tourists stay in their village, dance and drink with them! When\
  \ I saw how happy the people are, their smiles, traditional folk costumes and the\
  \ energy they had, I decided to stay overnight and support the local families, because\
  \ during the Gawai all the money from tourists is divided into all the families\
  \ of the village. \nOverall, Malaysia and the local people have made a big impression\
  \ on me. It is a modern country where most people speak English yet they have preserved\
  \ their culture really well! It is a place rich in nature, tradition and culture.\
  \ It certainly isn\u2019t the last time I visit Malaysia. I'd love to come back\
  \ someday and definitely for more than 10 days this time.\nNow, if I ask you after\
  \ reading what I had to say, what would you say about Malaysia?"
