Text: "Swipe right. Swipe left. A quick pause to show my friends what\u2019s on the\
  \ profile to get a few giggles and on with the swiping. Sometimes, it was a rapid-fire\
  \ swipe right to get the highest number of matches possible in 1 minute to win the\
  \ Tinder game. After a string of bad dates and horrible chat conversations, it is\
  \ impossible to take this app seriously. How could you find a soulmate with a swipe\
  \ right? What if you accidentally swiped left, does that mean you have lost your\
  \ soulmate forever? \nA profile picture of a chef at work popped up. He had fiery\
  \ red hair and a look of concentration on his face. Serious. I like serious. I swiped\
  \ right. A message popped up. \u201CAre you doing anything fun today?\u201D A refreshing\
  \ starter, I thought. I invited him to a Brazilian festival but he could not make\
  \ it because he was visiting the Cu Chi Tunnels. Ah, tourist! This won\u2019t last\
  \ very long.\nI was an hour late. I met him at the Ben Thanh Food Market. He no\
  \ longer had red hair, but he was wearing a red shirt. The date felt like a weird\
  \ version of Before Sunrise which started with a conversation over a dish of Pad\
  \ Thai, a typical backpacker\u2019s default. And, so I decided to whisk him away\
  \ to the restaurants, cafes and stalls that lined the long Truong Sa and Hoang Sa\
  \ streets that flanked the Nhieu Loc-Thi Nghe canal to get some authentic Vietnamese\
  \ food and Saigon Red beers. \nWe walked past the zipping and beeping motorbikes\
  \ and scooters and the luminescent bridges until we got to the main street where\
  \ we hopped on a taxi to the Baltic Beats music events in a place called La Fenetre\
  \ Soleil where us expats tend to congregate. A couple of cocktails and a few shots\
  \ later, we ended up heading home together and I woke up the next day to hear him\
  \ mumble, \u201CHospital\u2026\u201D And, I was like, \u201CAre you OK?\u201D\n\
  It turned out he was trying to tell me that he needed to get back to his hostel\
  \ to get his bag and head to the airport to catch his flight to Cambodia. Ah, the\
  \ usual ending to a tourist and expat date night! I groped for my phone, got him\
  \ a Grab, and it was time to say goodbye. \nSomehow, this farewell did not go as\
  \ planned. He sent me several messages from the airport and as the exchanges kept\
  \ going, I couldn\u2019t help but wonder when the residue of a magical evening would\
  \ fade and we can go back to the reality of being strangers again. \nThe messages\
  \ kept going until he returned to Vietnam to spend a few more weeks with me. Exactly\
  \ six months later, we found ourselves getting married in Hong Kong with a witness\
  \ that he literally stopped on the street. In his basketball shorts and with a fresh\
  \ cling wrap on his new tattoo, he signed our marriage contract, joined the wedding\
  \ photo and was off to wherever he was heading. \nTo this day, I still wince at\
  \ the question, \u201CHow did you two meet?\u201D He immediately answers, \u201C\
  Tinder!\u201D and I can\u2019t help but make a face. It feels like we\u2019ve become\
  \ some sort of testament that one can now find a soulmate with a swipe right. To\
  \ me, it was all about fate and good timing. We swiped right at the right time."
