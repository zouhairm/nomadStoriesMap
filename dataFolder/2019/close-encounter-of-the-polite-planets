Text: "I looked up flights to a nearby planet known as Mars.\n\nSheesh! These flights\
  \ were expensive, but I realized that nothing was going to stop me from embracing\
  \ the love I always wanted.\n\nI pictured my future wife waiting for me. Her skin\
  \ was a mocha-esque color and when we made love it felt like we could cure the universe\
  \ of hate. Our hearts breaking a part over the years only to mold into one when\
  \ we met at the arrival terminal on her planet. Our kiss so deep that I would feel\
  \ indebted to her with my life.\n\nMy friend Joe said, \"Maye, there's a reason\
  \ the application process for a passport, and the flight is so expensive. It's because\
  \ dating an extraterrestial is against Earthian Laws.\"\n\n\"Well, maybe Mars is\
  \ onto something we're not. Because it's legal there. I'm aiming to meet my wife.\"\
  \n\n\"You love her?\"\n\n\"Yes. I've never wanted to do something so bold or so\
  \ god damn crazy that I'm willing to risk it all for her.\"\n\nJoe looked up at\
  \ me and with every bulge of my vein popping out of my neck with eyes only focused\
  \ on him and the passport; he slapped and approval stamp onto the passport and handed\
  \ it over.\n\nTSA kicked me back several times before I was granted an escort to\
  \ the gate. I heard over the loud speaker \"Mars Ship will be arriving in several\
  \ minutes. Please have your boarding pass.\"\n\nAll I see at the gate is the President\
  \ of the United States with his cabinet and the Head of Travel and Security. \n\n\
  \"Son, what is it you're aiming to do?\" President asked.\n\n\"I'm going to walk\
  \ through that gate. Not a damn yellow toupee'd president or his dimwitted cabinet\
  \ is going to stop me.\"\n\n\"Is that right?\"\n\nI stood astute and still. I was\
  \ very nerved by his posture. He stood 6'2 or so it looked. I was 5'8 with 153 pounds.\
  \ When angry, I swelled up to an astronomical 5'10 and 190 pounds. I was willing\
  \ to do what I needed to do to bust through the line of dumbhats and douchewaffles.\n\
  \n\"I have an Executive Order that explains only those qualified can travel.\"\n\
  \n\"I bought my plane ticket and have my passport. Doesn't that qualify me?\"\n\n\
  \"You an astronaut?\"\n\n\"No.\"\n\n\"Work with NASA?\"\n\n\"No. \n\n\"Then, you're\
  \ not qualified. End of story.\"\n\nI calmly placed my bags down.\n\n\"Sir, with\
  \ all due respect, my future wife and I have been through hell. We have had our\
  \ marriage requests denied here many times. My dreams are like disco balls...shining\
  \ through the emporium of the concaves of my heart. I, one day, pictured I would\
  \ get to meet my wife face to face to dance on the floor under a crystal ball to\
  \ our beloved wedding song. To grow old and not wither. I had dreams where I wake\
  \ up at the moment of the purest beauty about occur and it happened too many times.\
  \ Now, you're the dream stealer....so you back the hell off... Or, I will show you\
  \ what 30 years worth of never getting that dream and finally getting that dream\
  \ today will feel like.\"\n\nAs he stared at me, the fluid drained from his face.\
  \ He looked like an overwrought car. By this point, his pride had begun to take\
  \ over until the whole airport turned silent and looked at him. \n\nA deafened silence\
  \ was accompanied by blank states and dissatisfaction. And, then, click clack! Click\
  \ clack click clack click clack click clack.\n\nThe First Lady had taken my hand\
  \ and with a thick accent said \"If it's love he wants, it's love he gets. There\
  \ is an Executive Order against who can fly the ship, not who can fly on there.\"\
  \n\n\"But...\" - he was stopped.\n\n\"And, there's damn sure no EXECUTIVE. ORDER.\
  \ AGAINST. LOVE.\" \n\nShe offered her hand....I looked at it, and accepted her\
  \ invitation onto the ship to see my wife.\n\nThe crowd of desperate pedestrians\
  \ looking for compassion found it! As I looked back at him, I liked to think so\
  \ too.\n\nI will always remember those words.\n\nNo. EXECUTIVE. ORDER. AGAINST.\
  \ LOVE.\n\nBy god damn."
