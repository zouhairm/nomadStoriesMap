Text: The Chicago in state of Illinois is place where I visited in Christmas time
  it was so fun visiting there the down town of Chicago filled with Christmas lights
  and the snow skating was fun the pretzels was mouth watery dishes and visiting of
  bean which holds the entire view of down town Chicago was very fun which covered
  entire view of the place .Dancing  to the Christmas songs have apple pie cake  and
  travelling through out the place and I had bought one dog named dumbo which was
  profound key to my happiness it has also travelled with me and my other dog Sasha
  it has been to Chicago bean which we had a picture together it was my happiest moment.I
  have experienced so much happiness when the snow fall began and temperature went
  down. Going to many restaurants and places like the Buffalo Wild Wings and grabbing
  some hot potato wedges and travelling to other restaurants as well .I have been
  in love with the place .I enjoyed every part of my journey .well I went to zumba
  classes which were part of my fitness routine which was also one of my good moments.Cooking
  and learning to cope with the climatic changes ,shopping in malls ,travelling threee
  hours from place we live in wood drive to the mall which is located  like farther
  to the place where we live and shopping my favourite watch and scents and visualising
  the snow every where and the smell of animal which is common there is always interrupting
  in our journey it was the funny moment ,bringing our new dog home travelling to
  the place of  kennel  and getting it was memorable moment and we have been to an
  another place before thatwhere I tought of buying the dog but was not as good as
  one we bought .well I liked the warm preztels there were almost found like in few
  places the bun was super tasty and almost a mouth watering dish and travelling in
  car getting new vehicles ,changing cars and heading to our destination.The people
  were warm and lovabale .Then we travelled to a warm place where I got a live music
  band which was very nice and some snacks at mid night going trough heavy snow fall
  and reaching the destination and I enjoyed every moment and the temperature on that
  day went down and it was so cold due to snow storm in the area I loved the people
  there and the mainly the mineeapolis city which is threehour drive from our place
  .Itwas a good place
