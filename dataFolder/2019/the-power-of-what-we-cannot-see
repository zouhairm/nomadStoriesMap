  \ by the pool. \u201CNow we wait,\u201D she adds while rubbing sunscreen in her\
  \ arms. I give her a positive look. I know that the next two weeks will be tense,\
  \ even if we are waiting in heaven on earth. \n\nWe are two girls in their bikinis\
  \ sunbathing, in vacation. Yes. But our visit to is also diplomatic. One of us may\
  \ not return home, might stay in this location. \n\nTo ease her mind I suggest the\
  \ Ubud spiritual staples. At the same time my inner skeptical jeers. I ignore it,\
  \ wearing my best friend hat and holding my confession. \n\nFirst, we walk it off.\
  \ Scooters come and go in both directions along the compressed road. We line up\
  \ in the narrow sidewalk, skipping over open sewers and colorful handmade blessings.\
  \ Excited locals try to get our attention, and it is hard to resist the endless\
  \ offerings of hanging rattan goods. \u201CCome in! I\u2019ll take care of you!\u201D\
  \ says a masseuse. \n\nAnd suddenly I have daily mat dates. Flowing with the rhythm\
  \ of my breath. The soothing and elongated voice of Ketut guides my following move.\
  \ \n\nInhale. \n\nMy hands slide and my knees shake as I stretch my arms to form\
  \ a wobbly warrior pose. \n\nExhale. \n\nDrops of water run through my face and\
  \ one of them gets into my eye. Winking I look up and the sun shines in the clear\
  \ sky. For the first time in my life I have felt what a drop of sweat feels like\
  \ in my sight. I collapse. \n\nKetut smiles saying \u201CAnchor in your breath\u201D\
  . I struggle and I lack poise. And I hate to admit that I am starting to enjoy this.\
  \  \n\nEvery day Xime is more at ease. The clock is ticking but we let it be. It\
  \ must be the place where we hide. Durian tastings, rice field catwalks, swinging\
  \ out our emo talks. \n\nWhat is a luwak? We ask. They don\u2019t answer but make\
  \ us try its primal discharge in coffee cups. It\u2019s nice! \n\nThere\u2019s a\
  \ volcano, want to hike? There\u2019s no toilet for hours but what a sunrise!\n\n\
  We visit a local home. Bless a house, what a shore! Offerings for the spirits of\
  \ the earth and the sky, the death and the alive. So much time it takes to keep\
  \ up with the cleanse of all divine.  \n\nGorgeous temples that excite my eyes.\
  \ Got your period? You can\u2019t say hi. How will they know? I ask. It\u2019s karmic\
  \ energy. The will charge you, the gods up high. In this life or the next, you\u2019\
  ll pay the price. Do you believe? She asks me back. I am not sure, but I must comply.\
  \    \n\nA man named Wayan reads my palm. He guesses all my fears and lacks. Want\
  \ a boyfriend? He is nearby. I want my visa! Xime replies. \n\nBali days give us\
  \ joy, open our spiritual senses and made our friendship deep. Maybe magic dust\
  \ in all the noodles we devoured? It was something we didn\u2019t foresee. A visit\
  \ short and sweet. Just like this rhyme. \n\nBut the day that I fly back home arrives,\
  \ and we still have not heard from them. I am hoping that a sneaky government email\
  \ would drop in her inbox while I pack my bags. Hopes are in vain. My taxi arrives\
  \ and her fearful sight catches mine as she approaches to hold me tight. I know\
  \ she resisted the idea to be here alone. But this experience will help her grow.\
  \ \u201CYou will be fine!\u201D I promise excited. \u201CBelieve in the power of\
  \ the mind\u201D. I jump in the car, see her disappear when we turn. \n\nPassport\
  \ in my pocket, air in my lungs, karmic energies, the power of thoughts, love and\
  \ friendship bonds. The power of the things that we cannot see is in the way they\
  \ hold us back, lift us up and shape us without our consent. Whether we believe\
  \ or not. \n\nTwo weeks have passed and my phone rings. Balinese number, I know\
  \ who calls. I smile to the sky excited to know that she is coming home. There was\
  \ nothing to worry after all."
