Text: "You taught me that feeling 'local' isn't confined to one place. It about the\
  \ way that you explore the one you are in. How you savour its moments, understand\
  \ it. It\u2019s about knowing that you are a person of the world and you will never\
  \ feel at home in just one place ever again.\n'Did you see the colours? Really see\
  \ them?'\nWe both saw that crazy sunset.  \nWe are in semi remote Pemuteran. The\
  \ wild north-west coast of Bali. I am dog sitting 5 crazies in a one room 'villa'\
  \ with their heads resting on my lap each night as we listen to the wailing and\
  \ chanting of a weeklong traditional funeral ceremony. You have just moved into\
  \ the village after getting a plate put in your collapsed chest, thinking that you\
  \ will never use it to feel again.\nI am taking a break from people. You have been\
  \ watching me walk those dogs every day and finally insist that i have a drink with\
  \ you at the makeshift bamboo bar.  The owner, Robot, brings us a coconut and a\
  \ Bintang. Its spills into dinner. We agree on a motorcycle ride the next day as\
  \ you need to do a visa run to Singaraja. A deal. We will ride no slower than 70km/h.\
  \ \nWeaving and truck dodging on one of Bali's main (and totally tourist-less) thoroughfares\
  \ I watch the dial hit 90 more than once. Not even the locals ride this fast in\
  \ Bali. Your stripy blue scarf keeps you visible to me even when I can\u2019t get\
  \ around a truck or bus that you manage to dart past. There are no other 'bules'\
  \ in the city. But there is an exceptional monument to cattle in its centre and\
  \ I do interrupt more than a few men pissing against their peach coloured front\
  \ walls as I try what you suggest and take photos of 'real life'.\n18 months later\
  \ I meet you at your new home in South East London.\nI\u2019ve been separated for\
  \ over a year. Nothing about my \u2018real\u2019 life was the same after the way\
  \ you looked at me during that sunset. Everything broke down and was rebuilt. A\
  \ restlessness awakes in me \u2013 I spend some time in India, in Cambodia. \nYou\
  \ call me and I jump on a plane from Sydney. 60 hours of travel to spend about half\
  \ that many hours sharing your world yet again. And you give me my favourite travel\
  \ story yet.\nGirl arrives in big city and is noticed barely picking at her food\
  \ at dinner. She\u2019s always pretty candid \u2013 and talks about the fact that\
  \ living alone has left her barely remembering to cook or eat. Food has always been\
  \ complicated by body image issues and eating disorders anyway.\nShe is told to\
  \ remember that eating is social and important and something she needs to relearn.\
  \ \nThe next night girl is asked to meet at a local pub. And is quickly taken to\
  \ a little council flat with a rusted swing set out the front where she is cooked\
  \ a traditional Polish soup (two Slavs hanging together) and a very fancy omelette.\
  \ \nWhen she is asked later what her highlights of London are \u2013 it\u2019s a\
  \ local produce market where the cheese for those omelettes is bought from a stall\
  \ with moss covered gravestones lined up behind it. It\u2019s a coffee shop that\
  \ plays classical music, sells cactuses and lets you sit there long enough to go\
  \ through all 50 artists in the \u201950 Artists that you should know\u2019 book.\
  \ It\u2019s going to see Renzo Piano\u2019s exhibition and learning that architecture\
  \ is poetry.  Then studying poetry in the back streets and alleys of every place\
  \ that you are privileged to see.\nYou taught me that travel isn\u2019t about seeing\
  \ \u2018sights\u2019. It\u2019s about living and breathing the part of the world\
  \ that you find yourself in. Feeling its heartbeat and aligning it with your own."
