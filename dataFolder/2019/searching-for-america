Text: "The sun rises early in Denver, peeking over the plains and reflecting off the\
  \ face of the Rockies. I was here to catch a westbound train to California, where\
  \ I would live in a van, sleeping under the stars, exploring vineyards and granite\
  \ monoliths. \n\nIt only seemed fitting to take the long way there, to \u201Cfeel\
  \ the country\u201D as John Steinbeck wrote. \n\nI guess, like Simon & Garfunkel,\
  \ I had gone to search for America.\n\nThe trip on the California Zephyr would be\
  \ a 35-hour journey across four states, one that wouldn\u2019t end until bay met\
  \ sea and the country ran out of land. With sleepy eyes and wet hair, I boarded\
  \ the train and slid into a table in the lounge car, lost in the haziness of morning\
  \ and the nostalgia of train traveling.\n\n\u201CIs this your first trip on the\
  \ Zephyr?\u201D a middle-aged man asked from the table across from me.\n\nWith a\
  \ \u201Cyes,\u201D he was in my booth, asking me questions and filling me in on\
  \ the trip ahead.\n\n\u201CDon\u2019t tell me your name!\u201D he said with a sparkle\
  \ in his eye. \u201CYou need a train name.\u201D \n\nAs he sized me up and gave\
  \ me a very romantic French name, I quickly realized that the train was more than\
  \ a method of transportation. It was a place where you could be anyone you wanted\
  \ to be.\n\nMy new friend David was rugged and bohemian, living in a cabin high\
  \ in the Colorado hills and scraping up a living from painting. His voice carried\
  \ the enthusiasm of a child, his grey hair years of experience.\n\nHe asked what\
  \ I did, and I rattled off an answer about a corporate job and bigger dreams, eagerly\
  \ inquiring about his life as a wandering artist, one full of risk but also practical\
  \ wisdom.\n\n\u201CYou have to find your art,\u201D he said. \u201CEach of us has\
  \ an artist in us. You just have to find it.\u201D\n\nIn this world where anything\
  \ was possible, I almost believed him.\n___\n\nThe California Zephyr is a historic\
  \ rail line that starts in Chicago and ends in San Francisco, mountains bleeding\
  \ into deserts, traversing narrow passages and open terrain. As it climbed its way\
  \ out of Denver, businessmen nonchalantly read newspapers as if they had never left\
  \ their kitchen tables, and I watched the country go by, David\u2019s words echoing\
  \ in my head.\n\nI\u2019d always had a gypsy soul trapped in a responsible body,\
  \ and this week on the road was awakening restlessness in me. It wasn\u2019t just\
  \ that I loved to travel. It was that discovery and exploration made me feel alive,\
  \ and the disconnect between that feeling and my day-to-day life was disconcerting.\
  \ I always felt that if I\u2019d been more talented or richer or luckier, I could\
  \ be one of those people who lived an extraordinary life. Instead, I was stuck being\u2026\
  typical. \n\nBut this idea that art is not something you possess but something you\
  \ find resonated with me. Maybe those people I envied were just normal people who\
  \ found a way to create within the confines we all face. And maybe, like the train,\
  \ we each had a moment where we got on and off, and we had to embrace the journey\
  \ that was uniquely our own.\n\nA stop at a station interrupted my thoughts, and\
  \ I noticed David standing with a bag in his hand. \n\n\u201CFind your art, Yvette!\u201D\
  \ he said, and he went off on the next leg of his journey, one filled with twists\
  \ and turns, like the life he encouraged me to live.\n\nAs the end of the line disappeared\
  \ into the fog, it felt like a new beginning. It had only been 35 hours, but I\u2019\
  d eaten breakfast in the Rockies, dinner in the desert and lunch in the Sierra Nevada.\
  \ I\u2019d seen Reno with its neon casinos, and the Central Valley with its lettuce\
  \ and pomegranates and Sacramento, with its big-box stores and interstates. \n\n\
  And most importantly, I\u2019d gained perspective \u2013 that this life I was living\
  \ was extraordinary. In each moment, I could choose to create, to find my art, to\
  \ architect my dreams.\n\nI\u2019d gone to search for America, but in a way, I\u2019\
  d found myself."
