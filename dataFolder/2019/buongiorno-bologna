Text: "Licking chocolate drips of gelato from my fingers like a child, I watch a busker\
  \ near me slowly roll and smoke a cigarette before packing his things. Shaggy hair,\
  \ leather jacket, cigarette dangling from his lips as he puts his guitar away. He's\
  \ got an image to protect, of course. He's got an image to protect, but not me.\
  \ I'll just be over here licking chocolate from my fingers like a child and grinning\
  \ to myself. Because it's the little things in life.\nAs soon as mister tough guy\
  \ packs up, two young buskers take over his spot. I watch them set up, appreciating\
  \ the girls aesthetic with her bowler hat, oversized sweater, and black skinny jeans.\
  \ She glances over and smiles at me, eyes crinkling behind round, gold wire frames,\
  \ and I return it immediately. She reminds me of home, and after months away already,\
  \ some part of me wants to know her.\n\nAcross the square, movement catches my eye.\
  \ Something bright and lively, and I realize there are jugglers playing together.\
  \ There's my cue! I gather my stuff, throw some coins in the buskers case, and head\
  \ off to join my circus people. I plop myself down on the ground nearby to watch\
  \ them play, but quickly move in to talk to the brightly clothed strangers when\
  \ I catch words of English floating between them in the air.\n\"Hi! Where are you\
  \ guys from?\"\nNew York and Serbia. They just met today. And now Texas.\nThis is\
  \ what I love about traveling. You make and break groups to fill a purpose in one\
  \ moment of time. You meet and form connections with people you will never see again,\
  \ but in that moment, you are friends and you are solid in your uncertainty. Connected\
  \ in your disconnect from a standard way of life. You are all you need in this moment,\
  \ and you will never meet again. Traveling reminds you to stop questioning the future\
  \ and just enjoy what's in front of you. I hope I will bring this home inside of\
  \ me.\nAs we juggle and play and share our experiences, I see the guitarist of the\
  \ busker duo pass near us.\n\"Ah, bravo!\" I call out, giving him a few claps.\n\
  \"Grazie! Sprechenzie dutech?\"\nI laugh, understanding the question, but not where\
  \ it came from.\n\"Uh, no...sorry.\"\n\"Ah, inglese?\"\n\"Si, per favore!\"\nHe\
  \ joins our group as if the four of us are old friends, and we sit like this, discussing\
  \ life for nearly an hour.\nEventually, Serbia says it's time for him to go. New\
  \ York says he'd like to stay and juggle. Italy and I go for pizza and a beer, which\
  \ I had set out to find four hours earlier, but when you're following the wind,\
  \ time becomes meaningless.\nWe wander the streets, eat pizza, stop at pubs, and\
  \ discuss all manner of topics for hours without a lull, until the last bus to his\
  \ home is leaving well past the witching hour. We drift reluctantly towards the\
  \ bus station, guitar and amp in hand, laughter carrying us through the cool, dark\
  \ night. \nAs the bus turns the corner, he takes my hand, grinning. \"It's been\
  \ a pleasure getting to know you. Please, if you ever need anything in Bologna,\
  \ or if you even just want to busk with me, give me a call! I will be happy to be\
  \ your friend here!\" He slips his card into my hand before releasing me, and with\
  \ a dramatic flourish, and an extra grin for the road, he's behind the closing doors\
  \ of the bus, and vanishing into the night.\nAnother friend, made and gone. Another\
  \ open-hearted invitation.\nWhat more could I ask for.\nI sing to myself as I walk\
  \ back to my hostel. Another beautiful day, passed and gone. I look forward to the\
  \ next."
