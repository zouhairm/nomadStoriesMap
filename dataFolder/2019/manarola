Text: "In high school, my friend Victor once told me about running into a classmate\
  \ during summer vacation. In Belgium. In a chocolate shop. \n\n\u201CIt wasn\u2019\
  t even famous or on a main street,\u201D he said, \u201Cbut we walked in and there\
  \ he was with his family. It was so random.\u201D\n\nI don\u2019t even talk to Victor\
  \ anymore, but I like that story because it amazes me, the singular randomness of\
  \ the universe. \n\nI thought of Victor\u2019s story when we \u2013 my boyfriend\
  \ Tom, and our friends Julia and Sam \u2013 arrived in Cinque Terre because the\
  \ place was not just touristy, it was filled with Americans. There were plenty of\
  \ Aussies and Europeans too, but I was surprised by the number of Asian Americans.\
  \ It was as though we\u2019d all decided to leave the sameness of where we came,\
  \ only to end up all together in a small crowded seaside town where, despite the\
  \ hills and narrow passageways, one could hardly turn a corner without hearing a\
  \ familiar American accent.\n\n\u201CWouldn\u2019t it be crazy,\u201D I thought,\
  \ \u201CIf we ran into someone we knew?\u201D\n\nAs our last evening approached\
  \ we had not run into anyone we knew, but we had eaten, hiked, boated and swam our\
  \ way around all five villages. At 5pm we hiked back up the winding hill roads from\
  \ our last excursion of the day, and I dragged my feet behind the rest who hoped\
  \ to secure a dinner reservation at the Trattoria dal Billy. \n\nI trudged past\
  \ a narrow staircase rising above to my right. I saw a man\u2019s shoes, his khaki\
  \ pants and then glimpsed his face at which I smiled briefly \u2013 another Asian\
  \ American \u2013 as I walked past.\n\nWe both stopped. \n\n\u201CDo I know you?\u201D\
  \ he said.\n\nIn an instant, I did. \n\n\u201CWe went on a few dates in Orange County,\u201D\
  \ I said, amazed, \u201CWe met on OkCupid.\u201D\n\n \u201CBetty.\u201D\n\n\u201C\
  Brandon,\u201D he said.\n\n\u201CI remember.\u201D\n\nAnd there in hills of Manarola,\
  \ I was stunned by the probability of the impossible.\n\nHe was an engineer from\
  \ Portland and when we met, lived in Huntington Beach. He played the guitar, made\
  \ his own beer and knew how to fly planes. He was close to his parents. He did a\
  \ very good Elvis impression, which amused me at first. \n\nOn our third date he\
  \ took me to Ruby\u2019s on the Pier. He held my hand and offered to buy me a kite.\
  \ When he dropped me off, he leaned in for a kiss. \n\n\u201CI really, really like\
  \ you,\u201D he said.\n\nThe kiss felt like construction paper.\n\nThe next day\
  \ I texted him the truth: \u201CI think you\u2019re a good guy. I just don\u2019\
  t see you in a romantic way and don\u2019t want to waste your time.\u201D\n\n\u201C\
  Wow, he wrote, \"I knew the kiss was bad but I didn\u2019t think there\u2019d be\
  \ such a huge fallout.\u201D\n\n\u201CNuclear,\u201D I said. \n\nWe decided to be\
  \ \u201Cjust friends\" and never spoke again.\n\nWhich is to say we caught up just\
  \ enough.\n\nHe was still single. A few months after we\u2019d dated, he had moved\
  \ back to Portland to be closer to family and was now in Cinque Terre with his folks.\
  \ It was their first night, but it was apparently going to rain the rest of the\
  \ week. \n\n\u201CLooks like you\u2019re taking the good weather with you back to\
  \ New York,\u201D he said. \n\nBy then Tom, Julia and Sam had emerged from the restaurant.\
  \ Brandon and I walked toward them. Tom, unsmiling, shook Brandon\u2019s hand a\
  \ bit harder than necessary.\n\n\u201CMy folks and I have a 7PM reservation,\" said\
  \ Brandon, \"So if you guys eat here around that time, it\u2019ll be even more awkward.\"\
  \n\n\u201CWe couldn\u2019t get a reservation,\u201D Julia said glumly. Rather than\
  \ feel relieved, I was disappointed too.\n\n\u201CWell,\u201D someone said. The\
  \ chance encounter had come to its end.\n\n\u201CGood seeing you again,\u201D Brandon\
  \ said. He nodded towards the others, \u201CEnjoy the rest of your trip.\u201D\n\
  \n\"I hope you guys do too,\u201D I said, because I did.\n\nAn hour later, Julia\
  \ went back to the restaurant and got a reservation for 9:15PM. By Italian dinner\
  \ standards Brandon and his parents might have just started their aperitifs. But\
  \ by chance, we didn\u2019t see them."
