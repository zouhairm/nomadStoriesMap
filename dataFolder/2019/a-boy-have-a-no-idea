Text: "This is a story of 30 -year-old boys who have no idea, what he is doing, why\
  \ he is doing and for whom is he doing. He failed in love, he failed in the job,\
  \ he failed in business, he failed in life, He has no clue what did he do, why does\
  \ he live? The days are passing without doing anything just passing and passing.\
  \  The cute and the smiling face is now dull, inner strength or motivation is completely\
  \ down. only the love whom he loves a lot now a days she doesn't have talks to talk\
  \ to him. He saw the world depends on materialistic things, not on human love. Suddenly\
  \ one day I decided to go out of the home to any random place and I moved out and\
  \ this is the time when I started my traveling towards my own life, now I wants\
  \ to see the every and each corner of the world, I want to fly, I want to run, I\
  \ even want to fall.. but don't want to stop.\n\nI started walking to the highway\
  \ and continuously I walk 6 hours and crossed a 40km distance and reached the first\
  \ village of my travel, this place name called Kosi where I sit for few hours and\
  \ had rested and start thinking to some specific place to travel and I decided to\
  \ go someplace where I found the mountain. So I decided to go, Spiti Vally, after\
  \ this I take the bus to Delhi and reached the palace majnu ka tila to catch the\
  \ next but for the destination. First I reach Manali it took around 13hour from\
  \ Delhi to reach Manali and when I reached there the beautiful Manali is dancing\
  \ in rain wow. I checked into the backpacker's hostel and fresh after this I went\
  \ out to explore some cafe to drink or to eat something randomly I choose one cafe\
  \ and ordered. This was the first beautiful movement for me drizzling rain and enchanting\
  \ view of mountains. still, remember this feeling. I also meet there some fellow\
  \ solo traveler there we chat and we eat together it was fun.  Next day I took a\
  \ sharing cab to move to Kaza, I started my journey with eating a sandwich which\
  \ I packed from one cafe. The road was terrible but the views compensated for everything.\
  \ I reached in the evening and I choose to stay out a whole night with the sky and\
  \ the stars. it was the clean sky with hundreds of stars, milky way, and many falling\
  \ stars. this moment was my best memory from my trip. \nNext early morning I decided\
  \ to go famous key monastery it was around 14km from Kaza. I walked some distance\
  \ and then took a lift from a tractor and I reached the key monastery, first time\
  \ I saw the monks their, I played games with young monks at the monastery. I saw\
  \ the cultural dance of some native tribal and after this, I decided to go to the\
  \ kibber village and stayed. There was an open field from where I could see the\
  \ enchanting view of the whole village surrounded by the mountains from all the\
  \ sides.  I am able to hear my breath there and I shouted there the eco voice was\
  \ amazing. it was around 14000 ft height I am at and stayed there in village homestay\
  \ and ate local food. Next day in the morning I saw the pea fields and ate a fresh\
  \ one from the plant. I had my breakfast and chatted with a homeowner who was a\
  \ charming lady. she told me many interesting stories related to their culture and\
  \ kibber.\nThe best thing she said to me that the whole village lived like a family\
  \ and there is no concept of poor and rich there, which I still remember and like\
  \ the most and fall in love with that place. I hugged her and took leave from kibber.\n\
  \nA story is still there but the words are less so hope I will meet you guys and\
  \ follow the story ahead hopefully. :) :)"
