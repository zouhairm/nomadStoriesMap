Text: "Yitzhak Rabin was murdered November 4,1995, at a peace rally in Israel. PM\
  \ Rabin was killed by an extreme radical fanatic, who was also an Israeli. The square\
  \ that Rabin was murdered in is named after him, \"Rabin Square.\"\n\nIt's the year\
  \ 2019; one of my daughters lives in an apartment right next to Rabin Square. It's\
  \ the center of Tel Aviv, quite impressive, sun always shines brilliantly on the\
  \ over size square; but it\u2019s the peace that hits you. It\u2019s a main attraction\
  \ for local Tel Avivians to hang in at almost any hour, especially at sundown. In\
  \ every corner, and between the fountain and lily fish pond, benches and chairs\
  \ are offered for relaxing in the square. I thought it would be crazy noisy, given\
  \ the location, as it remains a popular venue for many rallies, musicals and events\
  \ of all kinds. I was wrong.\n \nAcross the street from Rabin Square was my first\
  \ stop, to buy fruits and vegetables. Unexpectedly, the guys in the market were\
  \ speaking Arabic between each other but, as the Israeli clientele streamed in,\
  \ they switch to perfect Hebrew. The strawberries, cases of them lined the entrance;\
  \ they couldn\u2019t be resisted from the temptation of their scent. Neither could\
  \ the barrels of cucumbers, peppers and tomatoes. Their colors so bright, made it\
  \ is easy to envision in my salad. This is the neighborhood fruit store, it's owned\
  \ by Arabs, Arab Israelis. They insisted on carrying my packages across the street\
  \ to the apartment because my purchase was too heavy for me to carry. The guys wished\
  \ me a Shabbat Shalom (peaceful Sabbath,) and would see me next week, \"Inshallah,\"\
  \ (God Willing) they said.\n\nLater in the day my daughter confirmed that I went\
  \ into the right place for the fruit and veggies, and she also mentioned that the\
  \ guys there are cool, and many people really do get along around here. At times\
  \ if she is short a few shekels, credit is given without a second thought. There\
  \ is more to the story in the Middle East. \n\nIt has been said that America is\
  \ life in Israel. Freedom is the prominent vibe that is experienced in this country,\
  \ which has also been the story about America. Now, I\u2019ve experienced this in\
  \ Israel.\n\nThe other direction down the same block, and just minutes away is the\
  \ Yam (beach.) I parked myself in view of the volleyball games on the sand, and\
  \ windsurfers, who ride the waves all year \u2018round. There is also dancing on\
  \ the boardwalk, that draws a lot of attention, I stood watching for nearly an hour,\
  \ the people danced from happiness, as the smiles radiated all around. This can\
  \ be seen every Saturday (Shabbat) morning. \n\nI was surrounded by peace in every\
  \ direction.\n\nWhen I made my way towards Yafo, I discovered a mini city inside\
  \ the bigger city of Tel Aviv. I stumbled upon Arab Israelis who were into their\
  \ big game of Sheshbesh (backgammon.) They are serious players as their gaze didn\u2019\
  t wander off the board, they had many spectators. Many Israelis wait on line across\
  \ that street to buy pita baked with Zatar (a tasty herb,) the smell makes it irresistible.\
  \ Farther down the road I went for what is reputed as the best hummus in this land.\
  \ The entire area of Yafo is a feast for the eyes. It has the blend of Israelis\
  \ and Arabs living around ancient ruins, a story filled shuk, and the calmness of\
  \ the Mediterranean green sea as the back drop. \n\nThis is Tel Aviv, so many faces\
  \ to Israel. Given time, I encourage you to explore the inside of this remarkable\
  \ city, and then onto another side, on Israel's Northern border. \n\nThere the view\
  \ is inclusive of Syria in the background and Lebanon in full view of the Israeli\
  \ children playing in the playground as they giggle along. The north may be my favorite\
  \ corner of Israel, it is near the borderline, and the air is fresh and feels delicious,\
  \ coupled with a sense of peace. The vibe is intense and it\u2019s affect is calm.\n\
  \nShalom, the common thread through the region, this is the real side."
