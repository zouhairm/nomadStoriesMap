Text: "I met Eslam in June 2016, he was my intern at AIESEC in Delhi University  and\
  \ we became great friends during the 3 months of his stay. When he left Delhi I\
  \ promised to see him in 2018 in Egypt after finishing my graduation. Two years\
  \ of our lives went by, It was 2018 and I was President at my local committee. I\
  \ had to go and represent my local committee at an international conference and\
  \ by coincidence it happened to be taking place in Egypt. I was there. After two\
  \ years. Living my promise because of a coincidence. I finished conference and found\
  \ time to see him. It was unbelievable but it felt like we had met yesterday. We\
  \ went across beautifully streets of Cairo. Partied at the Lake city boats on Nile\
  \ river. Drank on the holy nile and threw the bottles when we saw Nile police following\
  \ our boats. I didn\u2019t expect to find Egypt so beautiful and the people of Egypt\
  \ so welcoming and crazy. Sitting by the beautiful Red Sea beaches of Hurgada watching\
  \ sunrise was something I didn\u2019t know I was craving for. Peace, that\u2019\
  s what I could feel all around me. How would expect to find the most beautiful and\
  \ hot dresses and gowns in a country where females covered themselves in beautiful\
  \ burkas but I did and I loved trying them out and brought some back home with me\
  \ to \xCDndia. I have waited since my childhood to see the great pyramids of Giza\
  \ and then I had opportunity to see it one day with Eslam, by a side of my friend,\
  \ we walked around the sand and watched the beautiful wonder of the world. I did\
  \ my first horse ride there and then we went inside the pyramid, excitement hiking\
  \ up all while we climbed up to see the mummy room, pretty exhausted and disappointed\
  \ to only find the mummy bed, but an exciting experience for lifetime. \nI still\
  \ remember when I looked down from flight to the entire city of Cairo, I only saw\
  \ brown and grey colours which was so different from my country which is colourful\
  \ and green but when I walked about the streets, it was so beautiful and calm. I\
  \ never knew something so different would make a place in my heart. I have promised\
  \ Eslam to see him again, maybe in some different country this time. I miss him\
  \ and I miss Egypt."
