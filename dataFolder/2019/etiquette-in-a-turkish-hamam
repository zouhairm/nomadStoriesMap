Text: "The day I arrived in Turkey was the day Recep Tayyip Erdogan was elected as\
  \ the country's president. As a leader who'd previously claimed that women shouldn\u2019\
  t laugh in public, I was wary as to what I'd discover whilst there.\n\nDuring my\
  \ trip, I decided to visit a hamam in the rather tourist-barren city of Sivas, hoping\
  \ to enjoy a soothing spa treatment. As I entered the women's section, I discovered\
  \ that this hamam was not accustomed to foreigners wandering into its historical\
  \ setting. \n\nOnce inside the humid echo chamber of the baths, it quickly became\
  \ apparent that when the Turks go to their local hamam, there\u2019s no time for\
  \ prudishness. The first rule when setting foot in a hamam is to get relatively\
  \ naked and get relatively comfortable with it. I was greeted by bare breasts in\
  \ every direction, totally transparent pants, women being scrubbed down by others\
  \ and I immediately felt ridiculous wearing my bikini, so off came the top half;\
  \ my inhibitions preventing me from baring all. \n\nUnfortunately, my Turkish was\
  \ non-existent so explaining the process to me proved difficult. In my mind, I was\
  \ there to enjoy a relaxing massage and exfoliation. As I was clearly failing to\
  \ understand anything in Turkish, one woman kindly offered to explain in German\
  \ what I was supposed to be doing. Sadly I don\u2019t speak German, but I eventually\
  \ realised they wanted me to go into the sauna for a while so I\u2019d sweat, which\
  \ would then allow the women to successfully exfoliate my skin.\n\nAfter sitting\
  \ in the sauna for approximately fifteen minutes, I grew impatient; I wasn\u2019\
  t sweating enough. Jumping jacks and running on the spot soon sorted that out, after\
  \ I deduced that exercise in a sauna would likely induce sweat.\n\nFinally, I emerged\
  \ and clearly glistened enough because a burly woman got me to lie down on the sallow\
  \ stone slab in the centre of the baths. As I lay in anticipation, I noticed an\
  \ intriguing series of gaps in the roof's brickwork, allowing sunlight to burst\
  \ in at intervals, which created intricate patterns around the walls. At last, I\
  \ was going to earn my relaxing treatment. Chomping on some gum and giving me curt\
  \ orders as to when to lift limbs, the woman vigorously scrubbed me down with a\
  \ rough flannel. Not quite the tentative care I was expecting. Next came the full\
  \ body massage. The woman rubbed a bar of soap between her hands and got started.\
  \ No muscle escaped the pressure of her firm hand and it certainly released some\
  \ tension in my body, although at the time I felt more like a chicken breast being\
  \ bashed to become an escalope. \n\nAfter my treatment, I learned from two girls\
  \ that many Turks go to the hamam as a weekly ritual or for special occasions. The\
  \ girls, curious as to why a pale, blonde foreign girl was in the baths this week\
  \ and keen to practise their English, approached me and struck up a conversation.\
  \ They had come to the hamam with most of the women in their family to bathe before\
  \ a cousin\u2019s upcoming nuptials. The girls were astonished to discover that\
  \ my parents had allowed me to travel abroad without their supervision, or that\
  \ of a brother or husband. \n\nAfter recovering from their bewilderment, they encouraged\
  \ me to plunge with them into the little swimming pool, neglecting to tell me that\
  \ it was freezing cold. Admiring how I did a little breaststroke around the pool\
  \ in a bid to retain some body heat, they asked me how I\u2019d learned to swim\
  \ and if I could teach them. And so an impromptu swimming lesson began, where the\
  \ girls at least pretended to appreciate my demonstration of how to do \u2018froggy\
  \ legs\u2019.\n\nThis intriguing interaction marked the end to my baptism of fire\
  \ into the Turkish hamam experience. I entered the baths expecting a well-priced\
  \ massage and a little scrub down but left as a semi-nudist swimming teacher, with\
  \ a newfound appreciation for my freedom to travel without the scrutiny of my family,\
  \ and to laugh hysterically in public without offending my country's leader."
