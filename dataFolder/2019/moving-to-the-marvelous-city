Text: "It all happened so suddenly. The Law School I had been accepted to gave me\
  \ just two days to personally confirm my enrollment there. And I lived 1100 miles\
  \ away from it. \n\nObviously, I couldn\u2019t miss that opportunity. So, I \u2014\
  \ a teenager from a little town who had never traveled \u2014 hurried to buy an\
  \ airline ticket to Rio de Janeiro. As I got in that plane, I really didn\u2019\
  t know what I was gonna find, but I did know it would be an unparalleled experience.\
  \ I didn\u2019t know a soul in that city: no family; no friends; no nothing. Also,\
  \ Rio is probably Latin America\u2019s most dangerous city, which drove my parents\
  \ crazy. \n\nDespite all that, I always had the urge to leave the nest and explore\
  \ the world. Spending all my life just in one place was limiting my talents. It\
  \ is impossible to know yourself if you have nothing to compare you with.\n\nAnd\
  \ so I went.\n  \nBefore landing, a frightening yet extraordinary feeling: the plane\
  \ has to fly across the mounts \u2014 and I mean the plane literally avoids them\
  \ with a zigzag movement. Thus, the runway is alongside the sea. The waves actually\
  \ get just a few meters close to the airplane; you can hear them. As I got into\
  \ the city and started talking to people and listening to their dialects, I realised\
  \ something: I also had a dialect \u2014 a very weird one actually.    \n\nI also\
  \ understood why Rio is still nicknamed \u201CThe Marvelous City\u201D, although\
  \ it has so much violence. Beautiful people; paradisiac beaches; the Sugarloaf;\
  \ and, of course, the Cristo Redentor and other wordly-known cultural landscapes\
  \ are some of the things that keep the city rolling and the put a smile on people's\
  \ faces. \n\nI went to see the Christ as soon as I could. I found it completely\
  \ different than the pictures. It is utterly impossible to know the vastness of\
  \ this World Wonder without actually going there. As soon as I climbed it, I got\
  \ speechless. The nature contrasts beautifully with civilization in this city. Entire\
  \ neighborhoods filled with modern buildings are cut by the world\u2019s biggest\
  \ urban forests. There is no end to this city's diversity: the streets are filled\
  \ with both imperial and contemporary architecture that fit very well together.\
  \ Also, as I would soon discover, the 19th century-style buildings often hide modern\
  \ enterprises and sometimes even crazy nightclubs within them.      \n\nI took a\
  \ deep breath and rejoiced: I\u2019d be living among all these beauties for the\
  \ years to come."
