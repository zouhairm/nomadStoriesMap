Text: "There\u2019s a joke among my friends that there are two things I actively look\
  \ for while travelling: graffiti and old men. As much as I hate to admit it, they\u2019\
  re not entirely incorrect, although I rarely seek out the old men. \n\nIn this case,\
  \ that\u2019s not entirely true. I was wandering around Edinburgh while visiting\
  \ some cousins on spring break and got sidetracked by an antique store on West Bow,\
  \ Bacchus Antiques. While I was browsing wares I knew nothing about, the owner was\
  \ quite happily ignoring me in favour of rubbing an antique ring along a pair of\
  \ strings. Indulging my nosiness, I pretended to browse the counter in front of\
  \ him to see what he was doing. My complete lack of subtlety cut short my snooping,\
  \ yet somehow led to an hour and a half of antiquing lessons.\n\nWhile I recommend\
  \ visiting Billy at Bacchus Antiques, I am obligated to warn you that he is the\
  \ quintessential crotchety old shopkeeper. My time there was some of the most delightful\
  \ abuse I have ever experienced. He was simultaneously delighted and dissatisfied\
  \ by my jokes. I spent 15 minutes teaching him slang, which appalled him and delighted\
  \ me. In return, he would tell me some obscure bit of information about Victorian\
  \ antiques, or how to tell if something was made well or not. We became so familiar\
  \ over the course of an hour that when the shop was invaded with actual customers,\
  \ I was pulled aside to ask how I was related to Billy, since he was actually somewhat\
  \ nice to me.\n\nConfident in our relationship, I started pointing at the canes\
  \ he had hung over his desk and asking if he had any \u2018Lucius Malfoy canes,\u2019\
  \ until he pulled out a cane that was actually a fishing rod (he claimed he used\
  \ it to deter robbers), a cane that had a wine opener (which was kept away from\
  \ me to prevent me from reverting back to my \u201Cstudent ways\u201D), and a cane\
  \ that had an actual sword in it. I was actually allowed to pull the sword from\
  \ the cane, but Billy hovered behind me with another cane, I assume in preparation\
  \ of a duel.\n\nFollowing my lesson, that was abandoned in favour of actually selling\
  \ something, I eventually slipped out while Billy was lecturing a group about keys.\n\
  Billy, despite his best efforts, somehow convinced me that every shopkeeper I met\
  \ that day wanted to be my friend. That was not true. I spent most of my afternoon\
  \ bouncing from bookshop to bookshop, and in one, I bounded up the register and\
  \ immediately started questioning him on the book he was repairing. I had already\
  \ wandered around the antique section of the store and stroked the spines of many\
  \ books, so I assumed he knew that we were kindred spirits, he and I. He did not\
  \ know, apparently. When it became obvious that I would get no more than a couple\
  \ words out of him, I tried another store.\n\nI have never seen so many different\
  \ layouts of shops as I did that day \u2013 there were shops with basements of books\
  \ and prints; shops with ten different rooms; shops with spiral staircases made\
  \ for elves; and a shop that you could only access the first couple feet or so,\
  \ it was so filled with items.\n\nAs the day drew to a close, I decided that I would\
  \ do one more shop and head back to the cousins I was staying with. I chose the\
  \ shop that had no sign, very little light, and a dirty window. You know, the prettiest\
  \ one. I walked two steps into the store and immediately wanted to leave. My politeness\
  \ demanded that I at least look around before I leave, but my rationality demanded\
  \ that I not touch anything because there was a layer of grime on just about everything.\
  \ Both parts were overridden by the owner of the shop, who rapidly offered me tea,\
  \ a job, a necklace, and asked to take my photo.\n\nUltimately, I ended my day by\
  \ high-tailing it down the street to get away from the shopkeeper, although I did\
  \ come away with an odd pearl necklace."
