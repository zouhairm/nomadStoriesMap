Text: "I was watching Black Swan, shut inside the four-walled green cubicle that I\
  \ called my \u2018room\u2019. Natalie looking into the mirror seemed to stare straight\
  \ through the screen at me. My stomach growled, I was hungry. The cell phone vibrated,\
  \ I had kept it on silent. \u201CBuzz buzz\u201D it crawled on the table. Picking\
  \ it up I held it against my ears, fiddling with the earphones. \u201CHello?\u201D\
  \ there was a pause on the other side, then she spoke, \u201CWanna go somewhere,\
  \ out to the hills? There\u2019s a train tonight. In two hours.\u201D I sat there\
  \ quietly repeating the words to myself.\n\nIf it wasn\u2019t for that particular\
  \ call on that evening, I'd have never known what I was missing. With a new sense\
  \ of purpose, excitement flowing in my veins, I trembled with anticipation while\
  \ I packed my bag. On a sudden impulse, I had decided to escape that green box for\
  \ one day. To go somewhere in the dark night. The whole crazy idea of going somewhere\
  \ unknown, unplanned, reminded me of Dean in \"On the Road\". I felt high on adrenaline.\
  \ Nothing could deter me.\n\nWe boarded the train two hours later. We bought tickets\
  \ to the general compartment. It was a noisy hen coop. People rushed inside before\
  \ the train came to a full stop at the platform. Wave after wave climbed in, skirming\
  \ through the doors. We managed to slip through with them. People travelled all\
  \ night standing or with barely enough space to sit. It was winter and as the train\
  \ sped through paddy fields, a bone-chilling breeze seeped through cracks in the\
  \ broken window panes. The wind whistled through the compartment, teeth clattered,\
  \ the skin dried, people huddled together, inch by inch closing the gaps in between,\
  \ to take the body warmth from each other. \n\nIt was difficult to sleep that night.\
  \ I kept shifting, checking the time, nudging the people around me, trying to find\
  \ a comfortable spot to lean on. Early morning, just before the break of dawn, the\
  \ train halted at a small station named Chhatna. We got down there with our bags.\
  \ The sky was dark. Brilliantly lit with tiny prick holes, scattered on the wide\
  \ umbrella above us. It was beautiful, standing there underneath the open sky, shrouded\
  \ in fading darkness. Birds weren\u2019t up yet. Silence reigned. \n\nWe took a\
  \ jeep. There wasn\u2019t enough space for all of us to fit in and the next jeep\
  \ wouldn\u2019t be there in another hour so we climbed onto the roof of the car,\
  \ sitting amidst luggages. It was cold and windy up there. The roads flew beneath\
  \ the wheels. We howled into the last remaining echoes of darkness. The freedom\
  \ in the air was slowly creeping in, intoxicating us. In the distance, small shapes\
  \ could be distinguished. Silhouettes of Susunia hills were beginning to appear\
  \ in the horizon. \n\nAt a random bend in the road, a tiny settlement spread over\
  \ the hills starting beside a small tea shop, we got down there and stood waving\
  \ at the jeep that drove away until it became a speck in the distance. We asked\
  \ for food at the shop and they served us hot tea with a loaf of bread each. It\
  \ was strange, the taste of the tea. Dilute but wonderfully scented, as if made\
  \ of snow; if snow could have a particular taste this must be it, I thought. \n\n\
  We spent the entire day going around this little town. People walked about leisurely,\
  \ trekking uphill and downhill, in a slow steady gait. They talked in low murmurs,\
  \ smiled a lot in response. We trudged along, panting up the slopes, red-nosed and\
  \ out of breath, stopping here and there to admire the view. Like petty thieves,\
  \ we were stealing fragments of bliss, etching them into our memory. The sombre\
  \ hills, the small town secluded from the outside world connected only by the thin,\
  \ dusty trail of jeeps leading to the railway tracks. The local inhabitants and\
  \ the way they dressed, their colourful accessories. The strange flavour of their\
  \ tea and the taste of bread, softly melting in the mouth, slightly pungent. \n\n\
  I had tasted freedom and it left me yearning for more."
