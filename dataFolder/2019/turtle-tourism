Text: "2017 had begun with a blast. My husband and me had planned a vacation to Kolthare,\
  \ a tranquil village in the Ratnagiri with an isolated beach. February marks the\
  \ beginning of the Turtle Festival in Kolthare, a significant reason to plan for\
  \ a trip. Villagers of this small place along with nature conservationist organizations\
  \ strive to protect the eggs of endangered species of Olive Ridley Turtles. Late\
  \ February/early March is the time when these young hatchlings hatch and find their\
  \ way to the sea. We would never want to miss this beautiful sight. Watching a new\
  \ life come to this earth is a sight in itself. \n\nAll the bookings were done well\
  \ in advance- travel, stay, food. We certainly did not want anything to go haywire\
  \ on this trip. \n\nThe resort that was booked looked amazing in the pictures- beautiful\
  \ ambience, comfortable rooms, lush greenery, photos of mouth-watering meals...\u2026\
  \ all looked so yumm!\n\nWith much anticipation about the entire trip I finally\
  \ left. The road trip was extremely scenic. It gave us some really beautiful views\
  \ of the nature. The abundantly flourishing forest road, chilly winds, the not-so-hot\
  \ sun all gave us pleasant vibes. January was indeed at its best! \n\nAfter five\
  \ hours of a wonderful drive we reached our resort. We looked at our mobiles to\
  \ check what time it was. That\u2019s when we realised, we had been away from the\
  \ digital and virtual world all this while. The beautiful drive had all our attention\
  \ driven away from our smartphones. And now there wasn\u2019t any network. \u201C\
  Welcome to an authentic vacation\u201D, we said to each other!  \n\nWe settled down\
  \ in our rooms and headed for lunch. The photos of their mouth-watering meals had\
  \ already made us feel more than hungry. And as expected, the meal was delicious.\
  \ Everything was cooked in a typical Konkani style with loads of coconut in all\
  \ preparations. We thought we could feel the hint of the local flavours in the meals.\
  \ \n \nWe headed back to our rooms to rest for a while after the hearty meal. We\
  \ did not to rush around but recharge, rethink, re-align, meditate, chill, hang-out\
  \ and looked forward to have conversations with other like-minded travellers and\
  \ the locals around. Later got ready to hit the beach and get a view of the much\
  \ talked about turtles on the beach. We decided to walk down the beach from our\
  \ resort and experience the vibe the place was offering. Initially it felt creepy\
  \ to us as the beach was a bit far off from the resort and we could see nobody around\
  \ but we still took a chance. \n\nThe sound of the waves hitting the shore was clearly\
  \ audible. The light breeze made the leaves sway gently. We had been living with\
  \ an overload of human population around us. But there was not a single human around\
  \ for about 900 meters. This human silence was hypnotic. We were thinking and perceiving\
  \ the world with the help of pictures, sounds and silence the place was showing\
  \ us. \n\nAnd suddenly we heard something pass by under the heap of dried leaves\
  \ on the muddy road. It got us back to reality in a jiffy. Frightened, we walked\
  \ as fast as we could to reach the beach. We were now longing to see someone around\
  \ us. After a couple of minutes we could see some civilization. And we heaved a\
  \ sigh of relief! \n\nThe locals were kind enough to show us the way to the beach.\
  \ There was only one narrow lane which led to the beach. It was a small unpaved\
  \ path. Looked shady to us but we went ahead reciting all possible names of gods\
  \ in our minds. \n\nAnd finally, experiencing our pounding hearts, we reached. After\
  \ living through all sorts of mixed feelings during this entire walk, we went in\
  \ trance looking at the small creatures crawling around all over the shore. We automatically\
  \ went into silence and didn\u2019t want converse. The sight of the small turtles\
  \ and the sound of the waves got us back to serenity.  \n\nOnce our hearts were\
  \ full of the mesmerizing experience, we walked back to the resort with no fear\
  \ and much more at peace."
