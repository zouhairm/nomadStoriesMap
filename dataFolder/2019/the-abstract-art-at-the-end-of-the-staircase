Text: "Delhi is only 268 km away from Jaipur. It takes about three and a half hours\
  \ by train and five-ish hours by car to travel from Delhi to Jaipur. And yet, in\
  \ all the time that I have lived in Delhi, I have only been to Jaipur twice. \n\n\
  The first time I went to Jaipur was also the first time I sat on an airplane. I\
  \ think the airplane ride was the highlight of the trip for me. Sure, the architecture\
  \ and the forts were nice. And so was the market. But I was in 2nd grade, visiting\
  \ Jaipur on a school trip. I was wrapped up with my friends. The city itself didn\u2019\
  t leave that much of a mark on me. And so, after I came back to Delhi on a train,\
  \ I promptly put the city out of my mind. \n\nThis was part of the reason why, after\
  \ growing up, I didn\u2019t want to return to Jaipur, even though it was close by,\
  \ was comparatively cheap and a place that I could easily discover over the weekend.\
  \ Besides, Jaipur is a \u201Ctourist city\u201D\u2014a city for foreigners to fawn\
  \ over. I, who lived in Delhi, came in contact with old architecture every other\
  \ day. I doubted if the forts in Jaipur, which I had seen already, would hold something\
  \ new for me. \n\nBut, as it so happens, I ended up going to Jaipur\u2014for a literary\
  \ festival\u2014in a car this time. As great as it had been to soar over the clouds,\
  \ for anybody going to Jaipur from Delhi, I would definitely recommend the road.\
  \ The route is scenic\u2014about two hours into the road, the green agricultural\
  \ fields that surround Delhi are replaced by the fauna of the desert. Low dills\
  \ dot the landscape. The deep brown of the hill and the dark green of the trees\
  \ was like a balm to my eyes. \n\nOn entering Jaipur, I felt an imperceptible shift\u2014\
  something I couldn\u2019t quite pin down. But this city, quiet and sleepy where\
  \ Delhi was boisterous and loud, instantly caught my attention. The first thing\
  \ I noticed after I entered the city proper was that the Hawa Mahal, the crown jewel\
  \ of Jaipur, seemed much smaller to me now as compared to the image that I carried\
  \ around in my head. It was then that I realized that I had obviously changed since\
  \ the time I had last been here\u2014and in a sense the city was new for me too.\
  \ \n\nI eventually didn\u2019t spend too much time at the literary festival, the\
  \ city was far too engaging. I didn\u2019t expect the Gol Gappas there to taste\
  \ different from the Gol Gappas I had back at home, but they did, in a nice way.\
  \ I didn\u2019t expect to find a shop almost hidden away in the bustling market,\
  \ or to find a pair of dusty, and yet exquisitely beautiful, bangles in a corner\
  \ of the shop. I definitely didn\u2019t expect to find an Absurd Art exhibition\
  \ in one of the old forts\u2014the one where Rajput rulers used to live. Seeing\
  \ a Dalek replica in an old, small room, or climbing the big-unwieldy staircases\
  \ only to be find an abstract sculpture at the top was an utterly strange, and yet\
  \ at the same time a delightful experience. \n\nThere was much that I didn\u2019\
  t expect to find, and much that I did end up finding. Jaipur, only five hours away\
  \ by a car, seemed like a different world altogether. The sleepy town, the strange\
  \ things that I found in that sleepy town, and the sudden realization that a long,\
  \ long time had passed since I had been in second grade made this a surreal, mind-opening\
  \ trip. A trip that I am glad I went on."
