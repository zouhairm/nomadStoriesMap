Text: "As the cab turned onto a crammed, one-way street off the broad and lush thoroughfare\
  \ of Avenue de Liberdade in Lisbon, my mood turned apprehensive.  All I had been\
  \ thinking about while sitting in bumper to bumper traffic from the airport was\
  \ my raucously grumbling stomach and how much I wanted to go to bed.  It was 20\
  \ hours of travel from Charm City, USA to this moment, and I can\u2019t sleep on\
  \ planes, trains or autos.  To say this dark and tiny side street did little to\
  \ inspire hope of finding a quick and tasty meal, would be an understatement; but\
  \ I kept repeating to myself \u201Cyou\u2019re always a pessimist when you\u2019\
  re hungry\u201D and attempted pushing my apprehension aside.\n\nOne block later,\
  \ my cab finally pulled up to the Lisbonnaire Apartments, my home for at least 3\
  \ days.  I went through the motions of my check-in and asked the vivacious gentleman\
  \ at the front desk, where I could go for a delicious and expeditious meal to improve\
  \ my demeanor.  Without hesitation he tells me to walk right out of the front door\
  \ and a \u201Cfew\u201D blocks down on the left I\u2019ll find a neighborhood caf\xE9\
  \ matching my criteria.  I dropped my bags in my room and immediately walked back\
  \ out the door. \n\nAlthough I did turn right out the front door, I never clarified\
  \ his definition of a \u201Cfew blocks\u201D.  After walking the same three blocks\
  \ four times, I finally decided the place with the green awning reading \u201CCaf\xE9\
  \ Tora, Cascais Remo\u201D was the one.  I walked in, surveyed the scene with weary\
  \ eyes and perked up a little. The restaurant was brightly lit, with a neon sign\
  \ over the bar and a fridge full of meats and other supplies for the kitchen behind\
  \ the bar. In the back, right hand corner was a group of six 50-something gentlemen\
  \ having an animated conversation, wine and beer in hand.  A young couple and their\
  \ 4-ish year old son sat eating dinner and watching the soccer match on the television\
  \ over the entry door.  Another older couple sat in the window, talking quietly\
  \ and sipping on wine from the bright green ceramic pitcher in front of them.\n\n\
  Clearly, this was a neighborhood caf\xE9 with regulars and, as any Anthony Bourdain\
  \ fan will tell you, regulars are always a positive sign.  \nThe solitary waiter,\
  \ a tall man with thinning gray hair, approached me.  I foolishly reached for my\
  \ Portuguese phrase book, but the pressure of people walking in behind me resulted\
  \ in my just smiling at him and raising my index finger to signal one.  He glared\
  \ back at me, gruffly motioned to a table and hands me a menu, asking me something\
  \ in Portuguese.  As I silently cursed myself for not learning basic Portuguese,\
  \ I said \u201CSim!\u201D and hoped I hadn\u2019t agreed to give him my first born\
  \ child. \n\nI quickly started looking up the words I didn\u2019t know (a.k.a. all\
  \ of them) on the menu in my phrase book.  As the waiter came back with a silver\
  \ bowl of garlicky smelling olives and basket of bread and butter, he stood over\
  \ me with the wariest of looks waiting for my order.  I stumbled through ordering\
  \ bronzino and answering \u201CSim!\u201D and \u201CObrigado!\u201D (thank you)\
  \ to any question.  With a clear look of apprehension on my face during each interaction,\
  \ the surly waiter appeared to be progressively amused by me.  I would find out\
  \ four nights later why.\n\nAs I scarfed down the juicy olives and warm bread with\
  \ soft butter, he reappears with the not one, but three plates.  The first full\
  \ of steamed and buttered potatoes, the second hosting a salad and the third dish,\
  \ much to my awe, was a whole (head-on), perfectly grilled bronzino.  The best thing\
  \ about this fresh, flavorful and delicious food was it cost a mere 15 euros!\n\n\
  Upon my return 4 nights later to try their grilled cuttlefish, I was greeted by\
  \ the same waiter.  This time I said hello and asked for a table for one in near\
  \ perfect Portuguese.  He smiled broadly at me, grandly waves his arms and in perfect\
  \ ENGLISH, says \u201CWelcome, back!  Please sit here.\u201D"
