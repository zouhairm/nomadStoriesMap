Text: "The wind was blowing so strongly under the torrid sun. Loud foot steps were\
  \ everywhere accompanied by the noise of colorful luggages. My flight was early\
  \ in the morning from a cold weathered Melbourne to a warm Sydney. It was nearly\
  \ a one day escape, I arrived in Sydney at 6 A.M and left that Opera town at 7 P.M.\
  \ An affordable black van drove me to downtown from the airport and my first destination\
  \ was Bondi beach. Right after I stepped my foot out of the van, I walked around\
  \ without any exact place to visit, I just wanted to feel the western lifestyle\
  \ without doubting anything. People were having so much fun and the energy got into\
  \ my soul, basically the atmosphere was just mesmerizing. \n\nAlong with my stroll\
  \ around the beach, I stopped by an ice cream truck which I personally think it\
  \ is typical in Australia but it is rare to be found in Indonesia so I gave my self\
  \ a chance to try then. The seller was lovely, he delivered some jokes even though\
  \ the queue was long. I figured out that the local people are respectful in their\
  \ own unique ways. \n\nI didn't get into the water because the time was limited\
  \ but I made sure that I enjoyed every inch of the beach. I stared at people laughing\
  \ with their relatives under the pretty blue sky, it was more or less about an essential\
  \ weekend environment in Sydney. It was dope because it differs from my Asian life.\n\
  \nSome hours well spent, I moved on to the Opera house where I finally met my friends.\
  \ I was surprised that it was more than what I expected. The buildings, the facilities\
  \ and even the cruise, everything was memorable and I couldn't get my eyes off of\
  \ those. Sydney Opera house was known for its weekly shows but without the shows,\
  \ this architecture is already fascinating. They say no one would ever get bored\
  \ of seeing this magical building and I do believe in that phrase, I have seen it\
  \ and proven that it has its own charisma.\n\nI experienced the tram, once. My Indonesian\
  \ friends who live there were being my tour guides for awhile, we went to a small\
  \ shop as I wished because I just wanted to engage more with the locals. It was\
  \ definite even the small restaurant tasted like big restaurants' dishes in my home\
  \ country including the looks. Nevertheless, I didn't have too much time anymore\
  \ since the clock was ticking and I needed to go back to Melbourne. I remember getting\
  \ on the black van one more time around 5 P.M.\n\nThis journey was the easiest that\
  \ I have ever experienced, I didn't contact with any strange or specific events\
  \ or people but I was mentally renewed and I have to say that this trip helped me\
  \ to find myself, the only thing that I didn't know I was looking for."
