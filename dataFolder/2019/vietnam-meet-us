Text: "It w as in 2012. We met each other in a bus going to Hoi An. He was from Australia\
  \ and I fell in love at first sight. I was traveling with a friend, and he too.\
  \ When we arrived to the city, we were talking about wich guesthouse would be better\
  \ to stay in and decided to look for one together. We found a beautiful one very\
  \ quick. That night was the moon festival in the town. As we heard between fishermen\
  \ on the area, that place celebrated every months the moon festival and all the\
  \ streets were decorated for a couple of days with many candles and lights guiding\
  \ you on the way to the river. We left our staff on the room and were ready to discover\
  \ the city together. When we came to the river, night had been covered the sky with\
  \ a cool dark tone and all the sky lanterns were dancing together on it. Freedom\
  \ sensation started to draw a smile in my face. I was impressed. We took a boat\
  \ on the river to send a sky lantern and make a wish. The fire was illuminating\
  \ his face and I couldn\u2019t avoid to feel something really deep inside of me.\
  \ It was weird. After all this walk, we needed a drink and went to a crowded bar\
  \ very close. Her friend and mine were talking together with some people inside\
  \ and he and me decided to stay outside. A long conversation about our lifes even\
  \ we were strangers. My English was not very good and sometimes I couldn\u2019t\
  \ get what he was saying. I will always remember the moment I told him \u201Cyou\
  \ should teach me English cause I am a little bit lost sometimes\u201D. He replied\
  \ me he couldn\u2019t and I asked why. \u201CCause a teacher couldn\u2019t kiss\
  \ his student\u201D Then he kissed me in the most tender way I never had felt with\
  \ someone. Vietnam had envolved myself since that morning and now I was in the middle\
  \ of something that would be the beginning of a big story. His name was Nathan.\
  \ And it happened in Vietnam."
