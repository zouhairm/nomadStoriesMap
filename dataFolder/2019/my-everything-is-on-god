Text: I like a  traveling to a beautiful areas and once upon a time I was traveling
  to malam jaba we decided that we go there with my friends and teachers and we start
  to collect the money form the students and teachers but still the money is enough
  we decide that we collect the money from MNAs of our village we go to collect the
  money but he say us that is that the month end we have no money this time you guys
  come in next month we say that OK sir . When we come again to the village MNAs they
  didn't want to meet us  we try many time to meet her but can't. Our friends decide
  that we need to collect more money from our friends we that to our friends and the
  answer of our friends is yes we give more money for this traveling trip and our
  luck is that when we enter to the swat there is the branch of our collage we stay
  here and our money is safe to stay in hotels and I learn that we think positive
  then our God help us we enjoy to much on that trip thank you God....
