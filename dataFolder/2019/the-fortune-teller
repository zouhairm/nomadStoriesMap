Text: "My father always told me, people yearn to know the future. Often turning to\
  \ psychics and fortune tellers when they feel desperate, this is when they lose\
  \ hope in life.\n\nIn 2016, I hit rock bottom. I was desperate to find love and\
  \ it seemed a goal I could not achieve. This is when I decided to travel to Istanbul.\
  \ I had heard whispers of a gypsy psychic who was known by the name Nouria. I could\
  \ not resist the temptation, the possibility to learn of love and successes hidden\
  \ in my future. Thus, I packed my bags immediately to take a leap into the unknown.\
  \ \n\n\nTwo days after leaving New Zealand, I arrived to Istanbul exhausted yet\
  \ an eagerness to discover my future kept me awake all night. I had Nouria\u2019\
  s address saved on my phone. She lived in one of the poor neighbourhoods in Istanbul.\
  \ Her house was located on the last corner of the street. \n\nThe road to Nouria\u2019\

  \ wires were sprawled over the ground between alleys. All of the walls were covered\
  \ in graffiti. Graphic drawings conveying specific messages from the public to the\
  \ government and the masters of the state.\n\nNext to Nouria\u2019s door hung a\

  \ buttered bread in his hand. He was eating the bread without responding to the\
  \ child's miserable looks. I knocked on the door and an old woman with grey hair\
  \ in short braids answered. She was wearing a dark-coloured tunic, a red scarf through\
  \ her hair and a long blue skirt. She greeted me reassuringly into her home which\
  \ was surrounded by scented candle and gem stones.\n\nI was nervous, Nouria did\
  \ not strike me as warm person, she seemed quite frightening and difficult to read.\n\
  \n\"Drink this cup of coffee, dear\" she said.\nI hesitated and questioned myself,\
  \ would she poison me? For a while thoughts raced in my head, but I was there with\
  \ a purpose. I drank the coffee and gave her the cup to make a reading. She held\
  \ up the cup and looked at me for a moment and said..."
