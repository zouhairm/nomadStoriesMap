Text: "There is this felling of not-belonging to any place anymore for some people\
  \ \u2013 including me. And it usually happens after a change, which can come from\
  \ a specific knowledge, an experience and, as well, a good trip. We change, meet\
  \ so many different out of our bobble things. We change and don\u2019t come back\
  \ anymore. And by this way, our initial place looks different, there are thing that\
  \ we meet and don\u2019t exist there, no one to share a different through. There\
  \ is something missing. But as well, anyplace we go doesn\u2019t fill everything.\
  \ All our background isn\u2019t there too. \nAnd there can turn to a dark place.\
  \ We can fear whatever we have to face that is different, cause we don\u2018t want\
  \ to change and don\u2019t belong even more. We can want to fit so much that we\
  \ adapt as we can in a single place hoping to blend in there. Or we do the opposite,\
  \ trying to find a place we can fit, what can make us travel a lot and cause a lot\
  \ of disappointments. I suggest that we embrace this hard felling to throw some\
  \ light on it. We are not going to find a home, a place to belong like this and\
  \ that\u2019s ok. \nEven if I couldn\u2019t travel a lot, as a kid I went to some\
  \ place that definitely changed me.  The first that I remember  was when I went\
  \ to a native village God knows where here in Brazil. That was an astonishing complete\
  \ different living that I have just seen in books. Even back then I could notice\
  \ how much that was modified \u2013 by the outrageous colonization process. That\
  \ already taught me that the books may be teaching wrong some stuff. I kept  this\
  \ things with me and later understood so many more. But the main memory was the\
  \ fish I ate. And I didn\u2019t  even like fish. And I never more in my life ate\
  \ a fish that good, not even my grandma could do that \u2013 and grandma food was\
  \ always the best. It was a totally different way of cooking, that I can\u2019t\
  \ describe because I don\u2019t remember the details, but it was in the middle of\
  \ the trees, right in the fire, no pans, pots or whatever. It was simple and right\
  \ there I already learn that the simple things in my life make me way happier. And\
  \ I keep some stuff I brought from there still now on my desk. \nThe two next places\
  \ I went was camping\u2019s. And I fall in love again and again and again with all\
  \ this things that change me. The adrenaline, the experiences. I still remember\
  \ the first time in a zip line. In a tree climbing. In just staying up all night\
  \ chatting with friends, or reading, or even cleaning with my father all the water\
  \ that came in the tent. All things that gave me news perspectives. \nAnd then I\
  \ didn\u2019t fit anymore where I was and came to an age to go to college.  A little\
  \ girl from a little town, the first of her family, went to another city to live\
  \ by herself hoping to find a place. And she didn\u2019t find. She found love, peace,\
  \ self esteem, problems, friends, problems. She didn\u2019t fill that fit there\
  \ as well didn\u2019t fit in her hometown. She has pieces in this places, relationships,\
  \ moments, memories, but none are her home. But she found the begging of another\
  \ trip that leads to inner acceptance. And in this place is transformed in home.\
  \ In her little studio, is home. With friends, is home. With the parents, is home.\
  \ Somewhere learning something, is home. Felling good and complete with all the\
  \ different parts of yourself \u2013 including the insecure one - is home. And every\
  \ other single place in the world, that we visit and bring the souvenirs, is our\
  \ house. The place that we live in. Where we eat, sleep, throw parties where there\
  \ are friends from different places in every single room, take care and through\
  \ the live can know every corner."
