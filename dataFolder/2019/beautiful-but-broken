Text: "It was the dead of winter when I set foot in Berlin. A holiday done on a whim.\
  \ The wind ate my face as I trailed my luggage along the city\u2019s cobblestoned\
  \ walkways, on my way to the Airbnb apartment.  \n\nHailing from Singapore where\
  \ skyscrapers and parks are aplenty albeit artificial, I found Berlin to be a far\
  \ cry from what I was used to. It\u2019s like if your mother isn\u2019t a really\
  \ good cook\u2014you take some time to get accustomed to any new dish she concocts\
  \ and in the end you tend to favour it for the nostalgia more than for what it really\
  \ is.\n\nWhile battling jet lag, I tried to make the most out of my trip. What better\
  \ way to do that than a fun 3-hour walking tour around Berlin, I told myself. Regretting\
  \ putting on loafers for this touristy adventure, I reached the meeting point 10\
  \ minutes early\u2014the Starbucks adjacent to Hackescher Markt S-Bahn station.\n\
  \nAfter an attendance check, our group\u2014a good mix of Europeans, Middle Easterns\
  \ and just one Asian (me)\u2014set out on the tour. Following closely behind our\
  \ tour guide, Torben, a boisterous and loud American, made me forget that my feet\
  \ felt like ice blocks.\n\nWe ventured deep into Berlin\u2019s rich but tragic past.\
  \ Acting as a prelude was the Berlin Cathedral, the cornerstone of the city\u2019\
  s gritty architecture. With the pure white snow blanketing the foreground, it stood\
  \ gloriously proud. I wouldn\u2019t have known the great amount of hardship it withstood,\
  \ World War II being the last chaos it endured.\n\nI never really thought much about\
  \ World War II. My indifference to something that happened so long before my time\
  \ came from growing up in Singapore in a very sheltered environment. The only hardship\
  \ I knew of was the Japanese Occupation of Singapore in World War II, thanks to\
  \ my Social Studies class in primary school.\n\nAdolf Hitler\u2014I can\u2019t remember\
  \ the exact moment when I first heard this name but it must have been through the\
  \ internet. As you can imagine, the tour was an eye-opening experience.\n\nWe huddled\
  \ in a circle, trying to keep warm while still maintaining personal space at what\
  \ seemed to be a random square.\n\n\u201CWe are at Bebelplatz\u201D, said Torben.\n\
  \nOkay, so it wasn\u2019t just a random square after all.\n\n\u201CMore than a century\
  \ ago, 10th May 1993, on these very grounds, around 40\u2019000 people gathered\
  \ to witness what we now call the Nazi book burnings\u201D, said Torben.\n\nAll\
  \ books that challenged Nazism were thrown in an open fire and burned.\n\nIn the\
  \ middle of Bebelplatz was a glass window on the ground. Peering down the glass\
  \ window, I caught glimpse of rows of empty bookshelves. It was like peering into\
  \ a soulless room.\n\nNot too far from Bebelplatz lies the Holocaust Memorial in\
  \ its eerie, melancholy. Numerous black blocks in the shape of coffins, forming\
  \ a maze, as a memorial for the Jews of Europe who were murdered under Hitler's\
  \ reign. If you hadn\u2019t guessed by now, I was on the Third Reich Walking Tour\u2014\
  the one revolving around Hitler\u2019s crimes against humanity.\n\nThe last stop\
  \ was Hitler\u2019s bunker site. I cannot fathom what it must have been like to\
  \ be him\u2014the guy responsible for millions of deaths in Europe. According to\
  \ Torben, Hitler took one last look at his madhouse before committing suicide. We\
  \ will never know though, if he had done it with any remorse whatsoever.\n\nShortly\
  \ after, we all dispersed and feelings of saudade crept up on me. Maybe it was because\
  \ I didn\u2019t see a ray of sunshine that cold winter day, or that I got a little\
  \ too attached to the people in my group, or that the stories told by Torben lingered\
  \ on in my mind.\n\nUnlike the movies or an award-winning novel, there is no crux\
  \ in this story.\n\nI can tell you, however, that I did not expect to find myself\
  \ savouring life and appreciating the things I had back home. If you look closely\
  \ enough, you can still see the remnants of World War II well alive, albeit in tiny\
  \ fragments.\n\nBerlin is beautiful but broken, just like every one of us."
