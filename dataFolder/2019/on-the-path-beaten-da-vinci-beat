Text: "Milano. Early May, early morning. Chilly, but the spots the sun hits are warm.\
  \ Elsewhere on the sidewalk, in the shade, winter feels like it has not been gone\
  \ too long.\n\nMost of the stores have not opened yet but the panetterias are just\
  \ slowing down, as the cappuccino, caff\xE8, and brioche rush at their bars reaches\
  \ the morning\u2019s finale. On the path leading to them and from them little flaky\
  \ crumbs and cigarette butts are sprinkled. A napkin here and there, likely dropped\
  \ by a tourist in too great a hurry to see the sights.\n\nAlong the well-trodden\
  \ vias pedonales, the herds now flock to the city\u2019s center for walking tours,\
  \ souvenirs, and photos taken with immortality in the background. Of the thousands\
  \ who built the great Gothic duomo over centuries, no names remain, and the Galleria\
  \ Vittorio Emmanuele only seems to remember his.\n\nNameless people twirl countless\
  \ heels three times clockwise over the mosaic balls of a bull in the ground. It\
  \ brings good fortune, the guide books say. You will return to Milano.\n\nA photograph:\
  \ the same clich\xE9 pose, different face. Then the souvenir shop and some gelato\
  \ while the next tourist does the same. In minutes, the gelato will be consumed.\
  \ Tomorrow, the souvenir misplaced. The photos, promptly shared and as promptly\
  \ forgotten. Like these footsteps, already, by the street.\n\nFew tourists will\
  \ make it off the beaten path and onto narrower, quieter streets. There, the sights\
  \ are more mundane: people opening stores, sweeping courtyards. Walking children\
  \ to school and stopping by the market for a few tomatoes, to be had on crusty bread\
  \ with fresh basil and olive oil for lunch.\n\nNo grand immortality in the redundancy\
  \ of the everyday and everylife. The locals know better than to waste time seeking\
  \ it; the gelato is melting, the tomatoes ripe.\n\nYou and I, and the crowds, find\
  \ ourselves in the Piazza di Santa Maria delle Grazie. To the right, the church\
  \ housing Da Vinci\u2019s Last Supper. Outside it, a depressing line. There are\
  \ moans about us, but you and I smile. We do not take a right, but a left, crossing\
  \ the street along the same path Da Vinci himself beat for three years, twice a\
  \ day.\n\nFor three years, from 1495 to 98, a young Leonardo worked on a fresco\
  \ 4.6 meters high and nearly 9 meters long\u2026 by day. By night, and early in\
  \ the morning, as dew formed, he cultivated a secret vineyard behind the Casa degli\
  \ Atellani.\n\nWe leave the tourists and immortal painting behind for the minuscule\
  \ plot of land, unpretentious, on which, centuries later, Malvasia di Candia still\
  \ grows. This grape variety will yield a crisp, dry, white wine, some time around\
  \ the month of September. Not meant for immortality, but as Da Vinci intended, to\
  \ be served with friends and conversation.\n\nThe Last Supper does symbolize a climactic\
  \ moment in religious and artistic history; a revolution in perspective, depth,\
  \ detail, colour, and technique. And thus, unfortunately, today it is one of the\
  \ most admired and reproduced paintings. But you and I are in a secret garden, drinking\
  \ wine, a forgotten Da Vinci masterpiece. The sun warms us. It is almost midday.\
  \ Soon, we will follow the path back for lunch. And then, maybe, gelato."
