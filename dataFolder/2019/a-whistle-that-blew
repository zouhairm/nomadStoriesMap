Text: "Do you have a whistle? I was interrogating in the 3rd shop holding a paper\
  \ with a checklist in one hand and a bag full of hopes. The bag had a pair of trekking\
  \ shoes, a raincoat and a few snacks. I hoped that these things would make my trek\
  \ a successful one. After the affirmation of the shop owner a whistle was added\
  \ to it. I wondered about the use of a whistle on a trek and I couldn\u2019t find\
  \ an answer that made sense. \nNext day when I climbed the bus I realized how foolish\
  \ it was of me to call my city as small. Around fifty people from this small city\
  \ were present in the bus and none of the faces seemed familiar to me. We all started\
  \ the journey towards a place called \u201CSandhan Valley\u201D. The package included\
  \ rappelling, due to which I made a decision to go on this trek all alone. Being\
  \ an introvert it was not easy to make such a decision. I wanted to give it a shot\
  \ for the sake of my intrest in doing new things, but my instincts told me that,\
  \ there is something more than that hidden in this journey. \nNext day, as the journey\
  \ started I met a person. This person attracted me the moment I saw him. There was\
  \ a kind of connection that I felt towards him. He had a charismatic personality.\
  \ I think he emitted positivity. I was soo much engrossed in my thoughts about him\
  \ that I totally ignored the information that our leader gave. Later I came to know\
  \ that rappelling was canceled due to heavy rainfall and we were taken to a fort\
  \ which was around 1200 meters in height. \nLuckily I was in the same group as that\
  \ of the person with whom I felt this strange connection. It was only after the\
  \ whole journey that I realized what this strange connection was, it was love. \n\
  Throughout the trek he taught me two most important lessons needed in life. This\
  \ feeling of mine was not only love at first sight, it was backed up by his perceptiveness.\
  \ \nThe first thing was about having faith in our own self. While climbing there\
  \ was an instance where I felt that I couldn\u2019t climb anymore. My other group\
  \ members motivated me by lending me a helping hand. He motivated me by saying that\
  \ \u201CI am capable of climbing the highest mountain only if I trusted myself.\u201D\
  \ Isn\u2019t it the same with problems in life? The more we take help from others\
  \ the more dependent we become. If we try to solve them ourselves we might find\
  \ our hidden potential. I founded mine by climbing the fort on my own. \nSecond\
  \ thing was when I  lost my way returning back from the fort. I was about to cry\
  \ when I heard a voice. My panicked emotion was suddenly changed into relief. He\
  \ told me that in panicking about the lost way I didn\u2019t bothered to enjoy my\
  \ view. I made a revolution and realized he was correct. The view was breathtaking.\
  \ It felt like the painter is master in his art and anybody would stare at this\
  \ picture for copious hours. He taught me that occasionally in situations of crisis\
  \ all that we need to do is wait and let the view sink in. Because sometimes even\
  \ being lost is beautiful. \nAfter returning from the trek all that I wanted to\
  \ do was to confess my feelings for him. I was clear with what my instincts had\
  \ to tell me. I went in front of the mirror and there he was, emitting all the Positivity.\
  \ I didn\u2019t expect to find a new me on this trek who didn\u2019t depended on\
  \ others and heard her inner voice. Yes, I confessed my love to myself. \nWhile\
  \ unpacking my bag I saw the whistle and blew it loudly, just as we did when we\
  \ reached on the top of the fort to symbolize our achievement. This whistle symbolized\
  \ my achievement of learning the greatest lesson in life \u2013 to love myself."
