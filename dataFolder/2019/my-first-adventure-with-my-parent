Text: 'Even though am the seventh child I got a rare opportunity to visit my country
  with my parent. In this amazing trip riding four different airplanes for the first
  time made me feel  blessed. The land dressed in green the sky shaded with clouds
  and amazing cold breeze with tiny drops of rain it was the best ''welcome home''
  greeting. Being in a town without TV, AC and the restroom is roofless was a joyful
  experience.  Living in a village full of friendly  people where i go willingly to
  sleep by 10 pm was weird; I couldn''t believe myself.  reaching  a point where am
  truly  exhausted from daily activities such as: walking around  the town, visiting
  relatives and playing with my cousin. Even more surprisingly is getting up early,energetic
  and manage to stay awake till the night. what I can''t forget is that night where
  I and for unknown reason looked up to the sky and encounter for the first time an
  imaginary scene, sky full of shining stars and in different colors i never knew
  that the stars had this variety of colors.I didn''t expect to enjoy all my days,  find
  joy in simple activities and have a summer without  boredom.'
