Text: "I was in Hyderabad and suddenly my gf invited me to Bangalore as it was the\
  \ 14th Feb next day . I had a chat with her on Friday evening and as it was weekend\
  \ I had no other plans except meeting my girlfriend . One things was letting me\
  \ slow was my bank balance , my wallet only hqd money for the survival for the whole\
  \ month as I was a student back then! \n\nSomehow I borrowed some money and booked\
  \ the train ticket for the return journey.\n\nNow it was time to leave Hyderabad\
  \ , soon I packed my bags and told my friend to drop me to the highway which leads\
  \ to Bangalore \nEventuality he dropped me to the highway where the actual rides\
  \ starts \nI got one local auto who was going to the same direction for 30km which\
  \ was 2/10 of my journey . I took a truck from there which was going to Bangalore\
  \ , my destination\n\nThings were quite good till he told me he has to meet his\
  \ friend and he will be back within an hour or so , so I had to be seated in the\
  \ truck \nHours past he didn't came back \nSo I moved in thinking I will get another\
  \ ride \nBroke af had 3 bananas during the day , walking and waking \nSoon I saw\
  \ the same truck passing by and giving me a fuck \nThat was the same truck I was\
  \ travelling in \nI missed it , I walked and one car stopped and took me to Bangalore\n\
  Finally I reached Bangalore but not at the correct location , my phone was off and\
  \ I had the location but not the right flat no. I slept on the streets and in the\
  \ morning mu gf came out and waked me up and kissed me on my cheek and said I love\
  \ u"
