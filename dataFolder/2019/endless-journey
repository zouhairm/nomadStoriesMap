Text: "I was very aware that my first time traveling from Barcelona to Cervera in\
  \ train I needed to check exactly the train stations, prices, schedules. So I did\
  \ it, I wrote down in a paper the train number, the stations available, hour and\
  \ I was ready for the next day to go.\nI woke up very early in the morning, take\
  \ my shower, teeth brush, summer clothing. It was supposed I must go to the main\
  \ station called \"Sans\" but checking the stations map, I decided to start my travel\
  \ from other station called \"Arc de Triomf\", near to my place and I want to check\
  \ a new station.\nIt was 7am and I was already on the station, but the ticket cabin\
  \ was closed, I needed to wait until 7:45am, so I was to take a breakfast on a beautiful\
  \ tiny restaurant near to the station, I asked for a \"tortilla de berenjena\" it\
  \ was delicious, with a cup of \"capuchino\". Now the tickets sale was ready, I\
  \ told the salesman \"Please one to Cervera\", He answered, ok you are just on time,\
  \ 11 Euros please. I paid and I went to the train stop, I wait only 15 minutes and\
  \ I started my travel.\n In Cervera I was headed to visit some family members, So\
  \ I was very excited, new Country, new city, first time in train, visiting family\
  \ I haven't seen in several years. I called them: \"I'm in the train right now!!!\
  \ We are on the way\", They answered, \"Ok great! in 2.5 hours you will be in the\
  \ town, keep calling us please\"... I was enjoying the travel, I completely forgot\
  \ to call, and after 2.5 hours, They called me again, \"hey were are you?, the train\
  \ is here, all passengers are out by now, we cannot see you...\" (they were thinking\
  \ I was playing with them), Me:\"I'm still on the  train, we are still on the way,\
  \ let me check... at this moment I can see the sea, it's beautiful\", They:\"Wait\
  \ what? there is no sea in Cervera...\", Me:\"oh common you are kidding me right?\"\
  , They:\"You are in the wrong way, you are going to Cerb\xE8re... France!!\", Me:\"\
  oh no, now what?, what can I do?\", They:\"Wait tell us as soon as you are on Cerb\xE8\
  re\", ok, I was really confused, first time on traing and lost, hopefully I talk\
  \ to the supervisor and He told me, you can find another train there... \nAs soon\
  \ I was there I tried to talk to the woman selling the tickets, first in Spanish...\
  \ nothing, then in english... nothing, \"Seulement dans Fran\xE7ais s'il vous pla\xEE\
  t\". I felt lost.... Finally after many tries I bought a ticket for the next station\
  \ returning to Spain.... just 1 Eu, pretty close, in Portbou Spain, I called my\
  \ family, Me:\"oh I'm embarrased, I don't understand why the guy in Barcelona gave\
  \ me a ticket to France\", They:\"Don't worry, it's supposed you must say Cervera\
  \ Lleida to be sure\", Me:\"hmm thanks for telling me now, the next time I will\
  \ do that way\" Once in Portbou I could talk in Spanish with the people there and\
  \ found the way to return. But no train was able to send me to Cervera directly,\
  \ I needed to do the whole trip back to Barcelona and there buy the ticket to Cervera,\
  \ so, another 3 hours returning to Barcelona, then I bought the ticket to Cervera,\
  \ 2.5 hours and I was on my destination with my family. Starting at 7am I was in\
  \ Cervera at 6pm, very long trip for a 2.5 hours trip. Talking later with friends\
  \ in Cervera, they talked about lots of people with the same problem, not only me....\
  \ but nobody believed they need to tell this to new travelers to Cervera. Now I\
  \ was very specific: \"Please tell everybody how to ask for the train ticket. 'Cervera\
  \ Lleida' \""
