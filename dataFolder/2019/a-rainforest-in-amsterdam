Text: "Cobbled streets and inky canals threaded with the whiff of coffee shops are\
  \ what I expected when I arrived in Amsterdam, but the startlingly blue butterfly\
  \ and thick Amazonian Rainforest were a complete surprise.  \n\nIn mid-November\
  \ when the air is beginning to cool and the sun still warms, Amsterdam\u2019s well\
  \ worn streets are overrun by a new calibre of tread \u2013 those of the avid film\
  \ festival attendee. IDFA \u2013 The International Documentary Film Festival is\
  \ a calendar highlight for documentary film lovers and makers alike, and takes over\
  \ the city for about two weeks of every year. But this year, while debates rang\
  \ out on hallowed theatre stages, and film execs drank too much at industry events,\
  \ I found myself late one night at the interactive documentary exhibition. It was\
  \ emptying out but they had one last ticket \u2013 \u201CIt\u2019s yours, you won\u2019\
  t regret it,\u201D said the lilting Dutch accent. \n\nThe Virtual Reality headset\
  \ hung suspended in a closed off area and I didn\u2019t even have time to ask about\
  \ the film before someone was fitting it tightly around my head. \u201CYou ready?\u201D\
  \ came a disembodied question, my awkward head-encased nod was correctly interpreted\
  \ and suddenly I was on a canoe moving swiftly across the Amazon River. Seated across\
  \ from me was a woman with a gaze so steady it made you forget about the pixels\
  \ it was composed of. Her skin was painted a rich red, which stood out against the\
  \ deep greens of the forest moving swiftly past us. Hushahu is her name and she\
  \  is the first female Shaman of the Yawanaw\xE1. \n\nAs the remarkable interactive\
  \ documentary unfolds, the magic of virtual reality becomes indistinguishable from\
  \ the shamanic magic of Hushahu. Amsterdam has vanished beneath the smoke of her\
  \ ceremonial fire, and the linoleum floor I was standing on moments before, has\
  \ been replaced by earth being pounded by the feet of tribal dancers. \n\nI learn\
  \ about the radical 100 year old Tata who made the extraordinary move to induct\
  \ Hushahu into the shamanic teachings of the Yawanaw\xE1 culture, and how his foresight\
  \ paved the way for female shamans, empowering women and securing the future of\
  \ his people. Just as I was on the verge of settling into the gentle voiceover and\
  \ the tropical jungle visuals, Hushahu, my Amazonian feminist warrior, begins to\
  \ transcend. Using the Ayahuasca medicine she is able see a world where connection\
  \ is tangible, a world that is humming with life, a world not quite visible to the\
  \ human eye \u2013 unless it is encased in a VR Headset. Abruptly I begin floating\
  \ and rising high above the fire, her voice is the string held tight to the vertigo\
  \ that threatens to overwhelm me. And then I am back in the forest, but a forest\
  \ unlike no other. And suddenly her words make sense in a way that moments before\
  \ was only intellectual. The trees all around me come to life, connected with an\
  \ otherworldly light, the sense of  connection she is talking about becomes palpable,\
  \ it\u2019s a connection between all living things, thus eradicating ideas of loneliness\
  \ and isolation. (It\u2019s not easy to unobtrusively wipe away a tear when you\u2019\
  ve forgotten you\u2019re wearing a headset.) A flash of blue catches my eye, a butterfly\
  \ skitters through this Avatar-esque forest of light, the magic is so immersive\
  \ at this stage, its wings beat a wind against my cheek. \n\nThe film comes to an\
  \ end and the credits role, but the when the headset is removed, I can\u2019t shake\
  \ the feeling of Hushahu still being there with me in the room.\n\nThe cobbled streets\
  \ are once again beneath my feet, the canals have firmly replaced the snaking Amazon\
  \ River, and yet something has shifted. Perspective is malleable, and there\u2019\
  s nothing like a chance encounter with a medicine woman from the Amazon jungle to\
  \ show you just how much."
