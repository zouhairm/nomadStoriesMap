Text: "The moment i saw him i knew that wearing the red blouse had been the best choice.\
  \ Pink can be too flashy, and this guy looked exactly as descripted on his Bumble\
  \ profile; inteligent and academic. So naturally i expected to project the same.\
  \ \n\nAs if first dates were not scary enough by themselves, now for some reason\
  \ i had decided to adventour and add the cultural, language and religious difference\
  \ factors to this first rendez-vous. Maybe it was just the romatized idea of the\
  \ Pocahontas tale, maybe it was the desesperation of a lifetime of singleness, maybe\
  \ was destiny ponting towards my true love, or maybe i just was the thrill of adventure\
  \ that comes along with your first experience abroad.\n\nWhatever the reason now\
  \ there was no way to step back, behind a pair of monture glasses the most intimdating\
  \ pair of blue eyes i have ever seen were now staring at me. Then it just rested\
  \ to face what for many travelers can be one of the scariest experiences in every\
  \ new adventure; face a native in his language, hoping that all what you are as\
  \ a person don't get lost in translation.\n\nAn awkward hug and the traditional\
  \ ice breakers sentences set the beggining of the encounter. Probably Orlando Florida\
  \ is not the number one destination of an experimented and brave traveler as it\
  \ is for most of the average amercan tourists, however the past eight months i had\
  \ been there have become the greatest  adventure of my life. Working for the biggest\
  \ entertaiment company in the world has given me the oportunity to experience the\
  \ multicultural dream i had wished for a long time. The random words in Chinese,\
  \ Norwergian, Portuguese, Arabic and many other languages that i hear everyday at\
  \ the bus or at the crowded backstage hallways give me, paradoxically, a sense of\
  \ satisfaction and at the same time a hunger to see more, hear more, experience\
  \ more and learn more.\n\nAnd yet there i was, a little paralized hoping that my\
  \ english high school lessons were enough to keep the pase of the conversation with\
  \ this PhD english student. Back in Mexico the idea of using an app to meet someone\
  \ always seemed as lame as unnecesary.Why should i should an app when all what you\
  \ have to do is just to start a conversation with anyone at any random place? But\
  \ here to do something as simple as that made my head overthink even more than usual.\
  \ What if this random person don't understand my accent? What if they don't like\
  \ foreigners? Wha if i don't fit on the beauty standars of this place? By agreeing\
  \ a meeting with someone you met on an app, at least  you have the certain that\
  \ you were carefully selected by the complex procedure of being swiped right and\
  \ not left.\n\nAfter buying a couple of beers the conversation directed to the topping\
  \ we had waiting for; Faith. Being raised as a Catholic in the norm in many Latinoamercan\
  \ countries, specially in Mexico where every sacrament received, comes along with\
  \ a big familiar party and a respective huge ammount of food. So i guess that for\
  \ a former Atheist and new born Catholic it would be normal to think that me, as\
  \ a Christian Mexican woman, would follow the rule as devoted Catholic. And i, as\
  \ could be expected tought that he, as a Christian American man would follow the\
  \ rule as a faithful Protestant. However the more you explore new places and new\
  \ people you'll discover that life is not commited to fullfil your expectations.\n\
  \nAfter turning my Catholic beliefs for a Protestant faith at the age of 16 i never\
  \ thought that meeting a Catholic American man would be so appeanling. A little\
  \ naive as usual, i thought that finding a man for whom faith could be a real conviction\
  \ and not just a cultural tradition would be easier in America. Afer all America\
  \ is the land of the free isn't it? And also, after all the number of Protestants\
  \ in America is bigger that the number of Catholics. However you never know when\
  \ will you play againts the odds."
