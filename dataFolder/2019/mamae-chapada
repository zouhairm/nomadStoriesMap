Text: "I remember thinking this is the birthplace of the world as we know it. Wilder\
  \ more powerful things belonged here. My friends and I cruised along in a rented\
  \ SUV amidst the red dusty roads and lush greenery, howling at the moon and hopping\
  \ from one geological marvel to another. The rock outcroppings in Chapada dos Veadeiros,\
  \ a national park outside the town of Alto Paraiso, are some of the oldest on earth,\
  \ estimated at 1.8 billion years. If we are made from dirt, then this land was filled\
  \ with our ancestors.\n \nAccording to locals, the close proximity of massive crystal\
  \ caverns beneath the surface of the park cause a higher electromagnetic frequency\
  \ and are rumored responsible for the abundant palpable energy. My good friends,\
  \ Vincenzo and Alex, met up with me in Brazil to travel to this uncommon pocket\
  \ of hippie culture. The only thing we knew before arriving was that it had beautiful\
  \ waterfalls, but the land had more to show us. \n \nJust outside the national park\
  \ sat Vale da Lua, Valley of the Moon, where local families claimed the land as\
  \ their own and charged us a fee of 5 reals to enter. A mile into the trail, Vincenzo\
  \ pointed toward a sizeable boulder in the distance and took off with the frame\
  \ and agility of a Kenyan marathon runner. \u201CTake a picture! I\u2019m going\
  \ to meditate on that rock!\u201D He leapt off the trail bounding through the low-lying\
  \ bushes. The next moment we saw him slip and disappear from the horizon as if into\
  \ a man-shaped hole. Suddenly he shot one noticeably different hand into the air\
  \ and yelled \u201CBros! My Hand!\u201D \n \nWe both clambered over to him and saw\
  \ that three of his fingers no longer sat parallel. Rather they had chosen three\
  \ separate directions entirely. (We\u2019d later find out that in addition to dislocating\
  \ his fingers, four of them were broken in the fall.) Being trained as an EMT and\
  \ son to an avid outdoorsman, I knew just enough to understand we had to set them\
  \ back in place. \u201COne.. two.. three,\u201D I counted, and then yanked forward\
  \ on all three, only putting two back into place. \u201CPut them back before it\
  \ really starts to hurt!\u201D he shouted. Okay one more time\u2026 Yank! And the\
  \ third finger finally slipped back into its socket. They appeared parallel once\
  \ more. Relieved I leaned over and kissed the top of his head, since the nearest\
  \ hospital was hundreds of miles away.\n \nI rushed back to the entrance of the\
  \ valley and asked the makeshift corner store if they had any ice. Luckily they\
  \ had more than just packaged peanuts and candies. I came back and we cleaned up\
  \ his scrapes. It seemed like he was going to be okay. We all breathed a sigh of\
  \ relief. The next question was should we continue on. With little deliberation\
  \ my friend said, \u201CWell yeah, what did we come here for?\u201D \n \nThe rocks\
  \ abutting this river valley were shaped like a Klingon\u2019s forehead. Carved\
  \ out crevices were formed over time by shallow pools of water lining the narrow\
  \ slot canyon. We giggled our way down the valley over the crater white rock and\
  \ through the ice blue water, delighted that we hadn\u2019t turned back. At the\
  \ bottom of the valley, a sign saying A\xC7A\xCD in big bold letters pointed to\
  \ a small trail.\n \nQuartz crystals lined the ground like common pebbles around\
  \ the A\xE7a\xED shack. Soon our bellies were full on organic vegan delights like\
  \ sesame-seed-crusted caramel cashews and sandwiches packed full of veggies and\
  \ hummus. An Israeli brother and sister who welcomed us with tan skin and even wider\
  \ smiles ran the cafe. They lived in a house that they accessed by ATV a mile out\
  \ from the river. My friend nursed his now oversized fingers and bit back the pain\
  \ as we tried to absorb the beauty around us.\n \nThat day our ancestors broke us\
  \ down and had us spanked, just to build us up again into wilder more powerful things.\
  \ As sunset fell, we watched hyacinth macaws fly by in twos and threes. We were\
  \ the only ones to visit the caf\xE9 all day."
