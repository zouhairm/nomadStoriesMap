Text: "\"That's Chalee sitting on the back!\", she cried looking at motorbike that\
  \ zoomed past us.  \"That's Chalee and John, I am sure\", she added. \n\n\"Then\
  \ they must be heading to the usual place\", her friend said. \n\nI had just arrived\
  \ that evening and met my couchsurfing friends, both being English teachers living\
  \ their dream expat life in Ratchaburi, a small town in Thailand.\n\nAfter finishing\
  \ Thai-iced-milk-tea, our dinner dessert; we decided to get onto the scooters and\
  \ go find Chalee and his mate. The scooters raced through the less-crowded-late-evening\
  \ roads of Ratchaburi. Being an Indian, I had seen and done worse than that. So\
  \ I calmly enjoyed the race, sitting behind my Colombian friend. They were enjoying\
  \ the freedom and lack of strict rules Thailand had  offered them, I thought. \n\
  \nThe scooters came to a halt in front of a pub, one of the two coolest places in\
  \ town for a night hangout, according to them. For this expat community, their choices\
  \ were pretty straightforward in Ratchaburi, either here or there. That was how\
  \ they were able to track down the exact table were Chalee and John were having\
  \ a drink. \n\nFrom outside I could see the few tables inside, the Thai people who\
  \ were having their evening good time and the local Thai band playing some music.\
  \ Then there was John the motorbike riding  German and Chalee a middle aged Thai.\
  \ Their table testified that they had chugged down quite some beer already. As we\
  \ entered, I could see most of the eyes following us. Maybe because of the presence\
  \ of a hot Colombian or because of our collective exotic value in that small town.\
  \ \n\nI was introduced to the two, though Chalee was busy on his phone. \n\nFor\
  \ the English teachers, it was their usual hangout spot as it was the only cool\
  \ place in town according to them. The other cool place was Chalee's house, my host\
  \ explained.  \n\n\"Is he also an English teacher?\", I couldn't contain my curiosity.\
  \ \n\n\"Haha..No. He is our good friend. He is one of the few people here who speaks\
  \ good English. So we hangout with him. He is a great local help too for us. And\
  \ more importantly his house is really cool. Maybe you should check it out\", she\
  \ told me. \n\n\"Finally he finished talking to his wife. Now meet Loong Chalee!\"\
  , John announced.\n\n\"Don't call me Loong Chalee. Don't make me older. Loong is\
  \ used for uncle. Yes, I am close to 60. But look how young I am!\", gulping a mouthful\
  \ of beer Chalee protested. He then leaned forward and introduced himself with a\
  \ big smile and firm handshake. \n\nI had no way to know how many bottles down he\
  \ was, but at the end of our conversation, my one night plan for the small town\
  \ of Ratchburi got extended to one more night. Chalee had invited me to stay at\
  \ his place for the next night. Being a no-plan traveler, it wasn't difficult for\
  \ me. \n\nNext day I was at the big gates of his home and saw him sitting at the\
  \ outside bar-cum-kitchen-cum-sitting area which he had built all by himself. There\
  \ was a Pizza oven too next to it, built by himself. \n\nHe was on a video call\
  \ that evening. He signaled me to come inside and sit. \n\n\"Sorry, I was talking\
  \ to my wife\" \n\n\"Oh, its alright, where is she?\", I asked.\n\n\"She is at her\
  \ home, not too far from here. But I live here alone\". I wanted to know more, but\
  \ I controlled my curiosity. \n\nOver the dinner, when he was drunk, he started\
  \ to reveal. \n\n\" She is almost 30 years younger to me. Her father doesn't allow\
  \ her to marry me. But she is in love with me! I don't know why! How can one be\
  \ so stupid! We don't live together. But we call everyday.\"\n\n\"Oh and we are\
  \ going to Laos for 10 days by bus! That is the time I get to spend with her, every\
  \ year for the last 10 years! And we're going next Friday!\"\n\nTheir annual 'love\
  \ vacation' was about to begin! And there I was still trying to process how blind\
  \ love can get!"
