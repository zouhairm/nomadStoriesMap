Text: "In this twilight of the Gods we call the 21st century, very few categories\
  \ remain unscathed from malicious scrutiny. People don\u2019t trust politicians\
  \ and they don\u2019t believe journalists; they\u2019re suspicious of pediatricians\
  \ trying to inoculate their children with vaccines \u2013 some of them don\u2019\
  t even think the Earth is round. Yet, when my father considered his opportunities\
  \ after medical school in \u201870s Italy, he made a choice that would end up assuring\
  \ my family a good living for the years to come. He would be a dentist. \nFor years,\
  \ as I grew up and made my own choices, everyone would lecture me about what a chance\
  \ I was giving up on, taking up languages instead of taking on the family dental\
  \ office. Being a dentist was pictured as the best a young girl like me could work\
  \ towards \u2013 especially as my country\u2019s economy crumbled in front of our\
  \ eyes. It was stable. It was well paid. It was pretty flexible. And, perhaps more\
  \ crucially, someone one there would always need a dentist. Then came Luis.\nWe\u2019\
  d met him leaning on his faded vintage car, right outside the tourism office. 10\
  \ CUC each, round trip. The equivalent of 10 dollars. That bumpy road stretching\
  \ between the powdery center of Vi\xF1ales and the white sands of Cayo Jut\xECas\
  \ was the kind of nightmare no taxi driver in his right mind would want to take,\
  \ the lady in the office had told us. Its craters were enough to send any car to\
  \ the mechanic for days, if one wasn\u2019t careful \u2013 but Luis was one of those\
  \ taxi drivers who risked it all the time. \nMy father, my sister and I had agreed\
  \ enthusiastically - two Australians in flip flops and flashy sunglasses waved feebly\
  \ at us from the passenger seat, before diving his head right back in some colorful\
  \ video on YouTube. Luis closed the cab door behind him. We drove off in that cloud\
  \ of black smoke that cars leave behind when something in the engine isn\u2019t\
  \ quite right. It was a great day for an adventure. \nHe had been going up and down\
  \ that same, old, rugged road on his taxi colectivo for who knows how many years.\
  \ You could tell by the way his strong, tan hands quietly turned the steering wheel,\
  \ carefully avoiding any pothole big or small; finding his way around even the most\
  \ insidious of fallen branches. Breathing in the humid air of summer in Cuba from\
  \ the half-rolled down windows of a classic \u201850s American car, we hung on to\
  \ every turn of the wheel like children hypnotized by a good fairytale. \nLike dark\
  \ islands in a sea of green fields, or lonely lookouts protecting the locals from\
  \ unknown dangers, the extraordinary mogotes \u2013 that someone with no imagination\
  \ would call geomorphological mountainous formations \u2013 passed us by as we ventured\
  \ away from the valley, into the forest. \nLuis talked away as if he was driving\
  \ some friends around for pleasure on some four-lane freeway. The stories about\
  \ Cuba and its bizarre laws \u2013 those imprisoned for illegally sacrificing cows\
  \ and the men who sold fresh lobsters in the depth of the woods to escape the State\u2019\
  s scrutiny \u2013 paraded in front of us as he sung his hopes and his fears about\
  \ the country he loved. The forest made way for a rougher path made of thin sand,\
  \ stretching between crystalline ocean waters. Luis had made it yet another time\
  \ \u2013 a modern Charon ferrying tourists towards snorkeling and palm trees. He\
  \ decided to stay around a enjoy the sun, that afternoon. \n\u201CWhere do I sign\
  \ to live your life?\u201D, my dad asked, jokingly, as we headed back leaving the\
  \ first shades of sunset behind us. \u201COh well, se\xF1or\u201D. His reply still\
  \ follows me around, a reminder for a privilege I\u2019d rarely stopped to think\
  \ about before. \u201CI used to clock in every morning and leave covered in sweat,\
  \ blood, and saliva every night\u201D. All he got was 50 dollars \u2013 the same\
  \ 50 dollars he made by driving up to that beach, avoiding those potholes, making\
  \ friends with strangers every day. \u201CWhen I got tired of it, I just bought\
  \ this cab\u201D."
