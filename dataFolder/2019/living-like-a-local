Text: "I never knew what \"live like a local\" really meant until I found myself in\
  \ a dimly lit patio in the South of Morocco, surrounded by 10 women serving bottomless\
  \ steamy mint tea and piling up in front of me all the wedding photos from the years\
  \ prior.\L\L\n\n\"Oh, j'aime \xE7a!\" I chirped while looking at some heavy-looking,\
  \ spikey Berber jewelry \u2014 only to later find out that you never say \"I love\
  \ this!\" in Morocco, unless you really want that thing. \L\L\n\nAs I was starting\
  \ to sweat at the smell of some more food being put on the stove, my husband came\
  \ through the door: the women were very excited to tell him about something while\
  \ pointing at me and then pointing back at him multiple times over.\L\L\n\nThe deal\
  \ was made: I was set to pose for a Berber wedding photoshoot later that week.\n\
  \n\L\LI met my husband one year prior, on a one-month trip to Marrakech: but this\
  \ was the first time I met his family on the other side of the Atlas mountains,\
  \ in Ouarzazate. \n\nWe all think we are seasoned travelers, that we can really\
  \ get to know a culture on a short trip... until life comes to you in the form of\
  \ a big loving smile and an intuition: \"I feel like I'll see this land again soon\"\
  .\L\L\n\nYou don't get to feel a place until you make real, human connections \u2014\
  \ and that doesn't happen in a few days.\L\L\n\nAn impromptu trip through the dusty\
  \ \"road of Kasbahs\" to a family picnic is not the same as going there with a guide\
  \ and a group of other travelers.\L\L\n\nWalking at night through abandoned concrete\
  \ monsters that should have become shimmering resorts is not the same without someone\
  \ who knows the story of their rise and fall.\n\nThe classic visit to the Ait Ben\
  \ Haddou Kasbah takes an unexpected turn when you stop on the side of the Draa river\
  \ because it's time for \"gouter\" (snack), steamy teapot and all. Sightseeing can\
  \ wait! \L\L\n\nMy visit to the \"door to the desert\" ended with my carefully arranged\
  \ Berber photoshoot: the same 10 women buzzing in and out of the room, wrapping\
  \ this long, white embroidered fabric around me, with at least 45\xB0 Celsius outside\
  \ and guess what \u2014 a steamy teapot on the stove and the smell of mint, almonds,\
  \ and delicious pan-fried dough in the air. \L\L\n\nYes, being married to a local\
  \ was definitely the best way to live like a local. I guess I'll have to find another\
  \ way for the next country I'll visit though!"
