Text: "We didn\u2019t know his name, so we called him Puppy. The first girl to arrive\
  \ at the house asked the staff about him, only to be told he belonged to the neighbours.\
  \ He ran around delirious that day, snapping at our heels, pirouetting through the\
  \ air, trying to herd us all together like sheep. \n\nNo one could figure out what\
  \ breed he was. He had short black fur with white splotches. His pointy ears flopped\
  \ over like a terrier\u2019s. We made a game of guessing as we sat around underneath\
  \ the frangipani trees and introduced ourselves. It was awkward, meeting fourteen\
  \ total strangers. Puppy was a welcome distraction. He licked our ears and fell\
  \ over his legs whenever he tried to stand. \n\n\u2018Your owners are so lucky,\u2019\
  \ cooed a Kiwi girl as she scratched his neck.  \n\n\u2018Should we feed him?\u2019\
  \ asked a fellow Australian. \n\n\u2018Nah,\u2019 said another, \u2018he\u2019ll\
  \ just get dependent on us and we\u2019re leaving in a month.\u2019\n\nWe were in\
  \ Canggu, a rural town on Bali\u2019s coast, to take a writing course and learn\
  \ Indonesian. That first night, everything was new. The unyielding humidity. The\
  \ sharp, acidic wine. We piled into GoJeks and followed our teachers to a local\
  \ bar for dinner. When we came home at midnight he was still there, curled up asleep\
  \ on the outdoor couch. \n\nPuppy didn\u2019t know a thing about discipline. We\
  \ tried to give him commands in Indonesian as we slowly learned new words. Tidak,\
  \ Puppy! Ya, Puppy! He blinked at us and continued doing the opposite of whatever\
  \ it was we wanted. In the mornings, we hopped on our scooters to start the journey\
  \ to class. He\u2019d go into a frenzy, jumping in front of us as we rode and darting\
  \ across the busy morning traffic. \n\nHe did other things that scared us. His favourite\
  \ was climbing onto the roof of the two-storey house and sprinting around, his claws\
  \ rattling on the terracotta tiles. We were flanked by a pig slaughterhouse on one\
  \ side and a temple on the other, so he had a marvellous time rifling through the\
  \ bins. I won\u2019t bother you with the details of what he left some days, spread\
  \ like a grotesque flat lay, across the lawn.     \n\nBut we loved him. Our resolve\
  \ faltered and we fed him leftovers. Seaweed crisps here, a slice of bread there.\
  \ He gobbled it all up so quickly that we should have been suspicious. After my\
  \ own dog died, he attached himself to me, nuzzling his wet nose into my neck as\
  \ my tears matted his fur. \n\nI can\u2019t remember when it changed. He didn\u2019\
  t fade gradually. One day he was in our faces, rambunctious as ever, and then the\
  \ next day he wouldn\u2019t get up. \n\nWe left him bowls of water. His head was\
  \ too heavy for him to lift it and drink. Some of the girls started asking around\
  \ about his owners. Where did they live? Could they take him to the vet? One member\
  \ of staff, a local young man, gave us an answer through Google Translate. \n\n\
  'No home. Stray.'\n\nThe next day, we sent him to a vet that ran on charitable donations.\
  \ Our time in Bali was almost finished. They vet didn\u2019t call us back with updates,\
  \ and we didn\u2019t ask for them. It didn\u2019t look good. No one was brave enough\
  \ to risk finding out. We distracted ourselves with other goodbyes and one by one,\
  \ left the country. \n\nTwo weeks later, we all got a message in our Facebook group\
  \ chat. \n\n'You guys. The hospital emailed me! Puppy had Parvo but he survived.\
  \ They\u2019re releasing him today.' \n\n'He\u2019s alive!!! Hang on, releasing\
  \ him to who?'\n\n'I don\u2019t know.' \n\nStray dogs lined the streets of Bali.\
  \ Maybe he\u2019d get adopted. More likely, he wouldn\u2019t. We looked up how much\
  \ it cost to fly a dog from Indonesia to our home countries. None of us had the\
  \ money. \n\nHe would have liked it here. Sleeping like a prince in Izzy\u2019s\
  \ old bed, misbehaving at puppy preschool, running around like a possum on the roof.\
  \ Terrorising the pedigree poodles at the dog park. I would have let him, you know.\
  \ I would have kept his name."
