Text: "I am feeling the sun kissing my face as its light reflects in the landscape\
  \ flashing by next to me.  My stomach is tense, and I lean my head back with a little\
  \ smile on my lips out of mere excitement. I can\u2019t believe it\u2019s finally\
  \ happening: I\u2019m going on my first solo trip. My head is spinning with expectations\
  \ and stories I\u2019m making up in my head about the people I\u2019ll meet, the\
  \ food Ill taste and the things I\u2019ll see. I\u2019m dreaming about meeting a\
  \ handsome dark haired israelian who will show me around. A curly girl who will\
  \ tell me a story work remembering. Sunsets that will take my breath away. Streets\
  \ filled with new spices and flavours that will explode in my mouth and embrace\
  \ my taste buds with new sensations. I cannot help myself but to dream about what\
  \ it will be like, though I know deep down all these expectations might end up giving\
  \ me a huge disappointment instead. But I know that this is the moment when I should\
  \ allow myself to dream big dreams because I have never experienced any travels\
  \ like the ones, I have done solo. Like the great writer H.C. Andersen said: To\
  \ travel is to live, and if there\u2019s anything like travelling, its dreaming.\
  \ Dreams can take you on a journey, a journey where all of your emotions are at\
  \ play. The feelings are all over the place, they are being swirled around and surprises\
  \ you. But one dream that never flirted with my travel fantasies was losing my passport\
  \ in the middle Jerusalem. \n\nLosing my passport alone in the middle of Jerusalem\
  \ surely was exciting. With my heart high in my throat Id walk back my steps from\
  \ the day and ask every shop or person Id meet if they had seen it. The dust was\
  \ dry on my body, my nose a little red and sunburned which I knew Id have to deal\
  \ with later, but as for this moment there was nothing else I could think about.\
  \ The perdition I had lost myself in contained anger and disappointment in myself:\
  \ how could I have lost something so important and precious? The one thing that\
  \ would leave so much trouble and leave a scar over my sunny memories from my Israel\
  \ travels. I was like a fire burning everything in bright laughter and spontaneous\
  \ decisions that leads me to trouble like this. As I was walking around with busy\
  \ feet I felt like I was in a mix of a heat jumping out of my chest and a fire ablaze.\
  \ I could sense a metallic taste in my mouth and I could hear my heart beat faster\
  \ and faster, relentless to the deep breaths I was letting in through my nose. My\
  \ senses were like a single petal in a field of flowers, except for the lingering\
  \ sting. But oh the moment my phone started ringing and the receptionist from my\
  \ last hostel mentioned his name in the phone, I could feel a river of water of\
  \ relief running through my body. It would be okay. And afterwards, one of my best\
  \ travel stories to tell. Who had after all been travelling solo in Jerusalem, lost\
  \ their passport and find it returned to them, all within a few hours? Though to\
  \ me it had felt like years passed in those moments, it is now one of my most treasured\
  \ memories from my trip. A little extra spice to feed my hungry adventurous soul."
