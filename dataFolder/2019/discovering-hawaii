Text: "I was at the Vancouver airport. My flight was in 3 hours and I still had no\
  \ idea where I was going to go and what I was going to do. Some people call it irresponsible,\
  \ I call it open-mindedness. When you plan nothing, anything can happen.\n\nThis\
  \ was the 1st trip where I didn't plan anything, I was going into a new country\
  \ with no hotels, activities, or transportation planned.  This was the best trip\
  \ I've had yet. The best thing I found with this leap into the unknown was the connections\
  \ I made.\n\nI stayed at a hostel for 2 days and met other travellers to go and\
  \ watch hula dancing at Waikiki beach. For the remaining my stay, I was with a host\
  \ on Couchsurfing. We went to the Hilton and watched the fireworks and then went\
  \ to a Karaoke Bar and I got drunk with a complete stranger. I met a local who showed\
  \ me around the island and brought me to secret spots only a local would know about,\
  \ as well as the Haiku Stairs & the illegal Sacred Falls. I also met people while\
  \ skydiving, scuba diving, and surfing.\n\nBesides having amazing adventures, the\
  \ second best thing about travelling is the connections you make. They are so profound\
  \ and meaningful. These relationships you make with these \"strangers\" make a big\
  \ impact on who you are and they affect who you are for the rest of your life. On\
  \ my previous trips, I've met some really great people who did just that. Dan from\
  \ the UK at Solstice (Stonehenge) said: \"When you meet someone you meet a little\
  \ bit of yourself in them.\" Anthony from Milan at my hostel who told me \"Travelling\
  \ is one big game of charades.\" Or even my Iceland ice cave tour who told me: \"\
  What is life without amazing adventures.\" \n\nWithout travelling and taking a leap\
  \ into the unknown, I would have never met these travellers/locals. I wouldn't be\
  \ the person who I am today without the impact that these people have made on me.\
  \ This is why you should always take risks and meet new people. That's what I think\
  \ life is about."
