Text: "What do you think of, when you think about Africa? Poverty, crime, segregation,\
  \ lack of education? If so, then this story is for you. Those answers were true\
  \ for me a year ago, before I traveled to Morocco for a few weeks in winter. As\
  \ a 19-year-old, who has visited 20 countries by this age, I had that crazy urge\
  \ to see as much as possible and Morocco satisfied that request. There was nothing\
  \ I did not want to learn: I read parts of Koran before my journey, read a lot of\
  \ blogs and sightseeing tips, so there was nothing that could stun me. Or so I thought.\
  \ My trip lasted for 2 weeks and there was not a day to go by, which has not revealed\
  \ something new about this whole other world. My first impression was surely negative.\
  \ There are no laws for driving on the streets, people constantly shout at each\
  \ other, streets are not as clean as back home, everybody is staring and few English\
  \ speakers. Sounds promising, huh? Well, lesson #1 - first impression is not always\
  \ true. I was lucky enough to use Couchsurfing - website for free accommodation\
  \ with the locals, as my hosts were my guides into the Moroccan life. The first\
  \ person was a Peace Corps volunteer, who has spend a year working in a Moroccan\
  \ school, where he has taken me. After that visit stereotypes about lack of education\
  \ were swept away. Imagine your child knowing French, Arabic and Spanish by the\
  \ age of 8? And that is not an exception, it is a rule for most Moroccan citizens.\
  \ They study religion and medicine and everything one needs to call the person intelligent.\
  \ Which leads me to another discovery - Morocco May be everything but poor. I do\
  \ believe poverty is a state of mind. Even though the country does not have the\
  \ brightest economy in the world and is considered one of the third world countries\
  \ - whether you come to a restaurant or to someone\u2019s home - there will always\
  \ be olives, dates and bread for you, as a guest. It is free and nothing, but appreciation,\
  \ is required in return. It is not about marketing, it is about loving your country\
  \ and wanting the visitors to feel not only welcomed, but feel like home. And I\
  \ truly did. Particularly, when visiting the small towns. I have traveled to Chefchaouen-\
  \ the blue city, where I would stay with a woman, who raises two boys without a\
  \ husband, only with her mother. Nevertheless, she does Couchsurfing, travels and\
  \ has a job of her own. It is not an easy job to be raising two children by yourself\
  \ and especially in an Arabic country. But she loves the place, where she lives\
  \ and hosts people in order to show why, and share the culture of this magnificent\
  \ state. One may try to dispute that she would be a lot happier in Europe, with\
  \ social help and moral support, but I believe there is nowhere one can be happier,\
  \ than home. And it is amazing that even in one of the most conservative countries\
  \ on the planet she has managed to be happy the way she is. Taking my journey to\
  \ the very south of Morocco - the biggest desert on the Earth, I have seen the entire\
  \ country from the window of the travel bus. We have seen villages, where people\
  \ would exit their houses to look at tourists and towns, where I was not able to\
  \ spot one woman. Nevertheless, there was not a point in my journey, when I would\
  \ not feel safe. Did you know, that the unwritten rule of Morocco is that if nobody\
  \ shouts a compliment to you or reacts to your appearance - it means they are insulting\
  \ you? People there are not reserved and ignorant, if they have a compliment for\
  \ you - they will not miss an opportunity to share it with you. \nBy the end of\
  \ the 14 days I fell in love with this magical country and its people. It taught\
  \ me to appreciate the things I have and my home, no matter how many flaws it may\
  \ have and for that Morocco left me eternally grateful."
