Text: "It was another tough period when you feel your soul heavy and exhausted ,you\
  \ need so bad to escape all this distortions and shut down your mind..\n\nI was\
  \ wondering Which place could recover & heal my soul & while i was searching i noticed\
  \ that there is a city in the south of Egypt Called Shalateen .. it is in borders\
  \ with Sudan but why nobody i know went there before .. why nobody talk about it,\
  \ why i Can\u2019t imagine even what does it look like ??! \n\nWhen people say south\
  \ of Egypt the image pop in your mind is Aswan ..\nTemples ,colored houses ,awesome\
  \ nature ,kind people..\nBut i discovered that the south of Egypt is  farther than\
  \ that  ..so i decided to discover this place, it was an adventure to go there by\
  \ my own ..it was like i\u2019m going to nowhere ..mystery\n\nI got the sleeping\
  \ train to Aswan then i got Microbus to Shalateen with the local people most of\
  \ them merchants ,some women get clothes and fabrics to sell in Shalateen ,Some\
  \ men are Camels Merchants going there to make some deals, that kid in front of\
  \ me hugging his mum and looking at me with his brown wide eyes and smile to me.\n\
  \nThey are all so kind and everybody was offering to host me ..  that make me feel\
  \ safe and encourage to continue that trip.\n\nI have enjoyed the road so much ,it\
  \ was surrounded with colored Mountains and in winter all that Mountains turns green\
  \ .\n\nAfter 5 hours we passed many time through the way with armed forces stations\
  \  blocked the road ,they were asking if there any illegal stuff with us and i was\
  \ wondering ..if i have any illegal things would i admit it that way!! They just\
  \ trust people when they ask \n\nI got to the hotel ..thank god there was a hotel\
  \ ..\n\nThe houses so simple some made of wood , some of metal  ,people live very\
  \ poor life even there was a lot of gold digging places\n\nthey live on sheep herding\
  \ and fishing .\n\nwomen there wear a colourful Sudanese saree (toub) and they make\
  \ cool braids looks so awesome ,when i was walking at the market i saw a very colourful\
  \ graffiti for a pretty girl wearing a blue traditional costumes i was looking astonished\
  \ at it and wondering could i wear one like this to take photos while the women\
  \ here don\u2019t like to take photos as a conservative manner .. and i did and\
  \ i really liked what does it feel\n\n\n\nthe traditional food their  (salat) meat\
  \ cooked on rocks.\n\nAnd traditional drink coffee called ( jabna)\nthey make time\
  \ for jabna  specially around fire at night\nwomen drink it \u0632together when\
  \ their  husbands and kids are out it was like a social activity , and i was wondering\
  \ what their conversations and stories would look like ? do the girls dream of prince\
  \ charming ? do they live love stories like novels and the girl go to meet her lover\
  \ next to that far tree at the sunset? , do girls here dreaming and want to access\
  \ their dreams , a lot of questions pop on my mind specially when i have watched\
  \ a painting of their wedding traditions  and it was super surprising .. the wedding\
  \ hold for many days and they cook plenty of food to celebrate with their relatives\
  \ singing  and dancing , some dancing in lines some dancing with swords and young\
  \ men make a compition for jumping ,the guy who can jump higher is the most fit\
  \ and athletic \n\nalso they have a very strange act ,the groom hit his  friends\
  \ with a whip to show his power and strength and to his friends bear being beaten\
  \ as a complement !! ..\n \ni met on town an old man taking a private place making\
  \ it as a local museum .. the place contain old books about Shalateen\u2019s history\
  \ ,old statues he told me he had found on the desert but it look like antiquities\
  \ ,i guess this man setting here since the beginning of history."
