Text: "Ijen Crater also known to Indonesians as Kawah Ijen is one of the most recommended\
  \ tourist site in Indonesia. It is also the largest acidic lake in the world and\
  \ is popular for its mesmerizing blue fire flames in the night. Located in the East\
  \ Java Island between Bondowoso Regency and Banyuwangi Regency. \nThere are two\
  \ routes we can take to reach Kawah Ijen. From the west via Bondowoso - this route\
  \ is shorter but way steeper and in bad condition, therefore, it is recommended\
  \ to use all-wheel drive vehicle but then it becomes quite expensive. After that,\
  \ there is a 8 km long walk parallel to the road to Pos Paltuding which is the starting\
  \ point of the trek to Kawah Ijen. The other but more popular route is from the\
  \ east via Banyuwangi which is suitable for all kinds of vehicles including motorbikes,\
  \ regular car to get to the starting point of the Kawah Ijen Trekking.\nWe chose\
  \ the eastern route via Banyuwangi because it\u2019s the same beautiful and lovely\
  \ place where I was born. It is way easier to travel via this route and also pocket\
  \ friendly. We woke up early morning around 1am and started to drive up the mountain.\
  \ \nAfter reaching the start point, we wore out warm jackets, hiking shoes and also\
  \ headlamps for hiking uphill in the dark. On my way up a stretch of never-ending\
  \ hills I saw a few miners passing-by with their baskets on the top. It took us\
  \ about one and a half to reach the top.\nAfter reaching the summit, we took a short\
  \ break, catching our breaths before preparing ourselves for the excursion. We all\
  \ covered our noses and mouths with a filtration mask to avoid direct contact to\
  \ toxic sulfur gas which may result in skin-burns. We climbed down into the crater\
  \ to see the blue flames, which is occurs near the huge cloud of sulfur gas oozing\
  \ out of lava. Sulfur mining has been ongoing at Kawah Ijen since 1968. The combustion\
  \ of the sulfuric gases creates a blue glow, which has become famous as the \u2018\
  Blue Flame of Ijen Crater\u2019. The sulphur fumes are strong, putrid, and definitely\
  \ not good for lungs. It is strictly adviced to wear a gas mask before stepping\
  \ inside Kawah Ijen. We were informed about this beforehand so that we are mentally\
  \ prepared. In case one has breathing problem like asthma then it is a definite\
  \ \u201CNO-GO\u201D though one can always have a good view of blue flame from a\
  \ safe distance. There is no need to push the limit and risk health to get in the\
  \ close proximity of these blue-flames.\nWe could see miners walking out of the\
  \ crater carrying baskets full of sulphur which they will sell for earning their\
  \ livelihood. We could see ceramic pipes installed on active gas vents by some mining\
  \ companies to speed up the natural process. These pipes channel gas into the mountain\
  \ then condense it into liquid sulfur which drips and freezes into sulfur collected\
  \ by miners. The miners then have to excavate the sulfur out using shovels and then\
  \ pack it into a red basket and carry it back to the edge of the crater which is\
  \ then dropped to edge of the road. \nThe wind will changes directly quite often\
  \ and this may cause a sudden gush all of the gas right onto your face, engulfing\
  \ you for up to a minute in the foul sulfur gas, when that happens it\u2019s advised\
  \ to not stay down there too long get away for that gas cloud. Anyway, we enjoyed\
  \ the extraordinary phenomenon and then returned to the top to watch the mesmerising\
  \ sunrise. \nThis was an interesting place to be at with all those big mountains\
  \ actually blocking a fair share of sunrise light.  We could enjoy the sunrise from\
  \ anypoint of around the crater. We really enjoyed the epic and large scale natural\
  \ beauty of Kawah Ijen."
