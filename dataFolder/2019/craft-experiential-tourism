Text: "Craft Tourism is one of the industry, which can help in harnessing the true\
  \ potential of the craft ecosystem. Tourism and crafts are highly interlinked. A\
  \ tourist is always seeking an experience that is memorable and enriching and along\
  \ with it, a tourist wishes to carry craft souvenirs as a memoir of their travel.\
  \  According to UNEP and UNTWO (2005), It is estimated that tourists spend around\
  \ 40 per cent of their budget on souvenir purchases and other craft products.  Recent\
  \ trends show that tourism earnings have come to rely more and more on the craft\
  \ component (UNWTO, 2001). Henceforth, it becomes important to develop systems to\
  \ systemise the production value chain. Another aspect is to plan and develop engaging\
  \ craft experiences for the tourist. This has lately been a very popular trend.\
  \ It not only increases the consciousness of the tourist about the craftspeople\
  \ and craft processes but also makes the tourist aware of the social, cultural and\
  \ environmental challenges associated with the craft sector. Handicraft has been\
  \ regarded as the carrier of local culture and history. A tourist buying a craft\
  \ item means he/ she is knowingly or unknowingly buying a message to be taken home.\
  \ (Baruah & Sarma, 2016). One of the key components of craft tourism is to engage\
  \ the tourist/consumer with the local craftspeople and production process. Allowing\
  \ tourists to engage directly with the supply chain provides not only the opportunity\
  \ to share knowledge and raise awareness of the creative process, but also help\
  \ in deeper understanding and value-building of crafts. Tourism can be a considerable\
  \ force for the conservation of historic and cultural heritage and can stimulate\
  \ arts, crafts and other creative activities within communities (UNEP & UNTWO, 2005)\
  \ \n\nHence, I am looking forward to travelling and document, Simultaneously analyse\
  \ the scope and future of Craft Experiential Tourism around the different parts\
  \ of the World."
