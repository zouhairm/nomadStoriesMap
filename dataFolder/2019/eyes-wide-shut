Text: "\u201CThe name\u2019s LG, like the company that sells gas\u201D he\u2019d said,\
  \ in his southern American twang.\n  \nIt was the first evening of our ten day tour.\
  \ We were five international strangers: An Italian, two Americans, a Swiss and I,\
  \ dining around a restaurant table on the top floor of one of the highest hotels\
  \ in Athens. \n\n\u201CCivil Engineer, Master\u2019s degree,\u201D LG went on, whilst\
  \ forking at his salad suspiciously. Half an hour into conversation and still only\
  \ one person had spoken. He was yet to take a breath. \u201CI\u2019m a real meat\
  \ and potatoes man so Greece is a lot to get used to\u2026 In our hotel room, they\
  \ don\u2019t have the hand towels like they do in the U.S.\u201D\n\nA smile was\
  \ contrived before I directed it towards the window, at the ancient Parthenon reigning\
  \ upon the Acropolis, still holding an elevated dominion over time. Its backdrop,\
  \ the sky, resembled an inverted ocean of shrimp, amber and coral coloured waves\
  \ washing away the sun. \n\n\u201CWhat about you, Miss?\u201D He finally inhaled.\
  \ A half-eaten pitta pointed at my face. \u201CI can tell by your accent you\u2019\
  re British. What 'cha think about this Brexit?\u2019 \n\nTwenty- three hours clean.\
  \ A mere twenty-three hours clean of the golden brown Brexit I was trying to rehabilitate\
  \ from. It consumed me. It consumed the country I called home and everything inside\
  \ of it. I tapped my veins and prepared the syringe, injecting the table with a\
  \ shot of hopelessness, throwing in a final smack of anger before my muscles relaxed\
  \ back into my chair. The day\u2019s dose was done.\n\nThe Italian woman took advantage\
  \ of the silent space my fear occupied and entered it gracefully, like regal hands\
  \ moving into silk gloves. At the time, I could do little else with her words except\
  \ trivialise them, because such profundity is like diamond seas on unexplored planets,\
  \ heating away beneath powerful stoves. Reduction is inevitable.\n\n\u201CIt\u2019\
  s like the Indian philosopher Krishnamurti said\u201D she began. My eyes rolled\
  \ without conscious will. \u201CThe world is as it is because we are as we are:\
  \ judgemental, greedy, violent and fragmented in ourselves. There is war outside,\
  \ separation outside, because there is war and separation within.\u201D\n    \n\
  \                                                                              \
  \                                    ***\n\nDay nine, in the big brother world:\
  \ Our group, thirty people strong, have visited a museum in Delphi which the Greeks\
  \ once deemed the \u2018naval of the world\u2019. We are told that wisdom of humanities\
  \ collective past can be found here.\n\nOur guide for the afternoon, Kat, is asking\
  \ if we can understand what she\u2019s just said, and we give her reassurance. \n\
  \n\u201CI don\u2019t want it to be all Greek to you\" she says, bursting into a\
  \ joyous warming belly laugh that makes LG chuckle from behind. He slaps his thigh\
  \ a little. The Italian woman, Sofia, stands next to me, carrying the heavy backpack\
  \ of a retired French woman.\n\nOur knowledgeable Greek Shephard sweeps across the\
  \ wooden floor of the gallery, and we, the herd, follow. In front of a giant painting\
  \ she stands. Depicted in this art, a curly haired woman sits with her legs crossed\
  \ on a white bull, staring ardently across the horizon. \n\n\u201CWhere are you\
  \ from?\u201D the guide remembers to ask, to which LG shouts \u2018Planet Earth,\u2019\
  \ and we all laugh: The un-travelled Americans, the pizza and pasta loving Italians,\
  \ the loud Spaniards, the arrogant French, the methodical Germans, even the stiff\
  \ upper lip, tea drinking Brit, with all her judgements and fears, with all her\
  \ divisions and boxes. We laugh, whilst standing together in the birthplace of our\
  \ western civilisation, because that\u2019s what we humans do in times of turmoil.\
  \ Laughter soothes the wounds. It masks the horror of living in a world that no\
  \ longer thrives, but instead resembles the dismembered limbs of a wild, majestic,\
  \ endangered animal. Countries divided like us. Walls built inside out. \n\nKat\
  \ draws our attention to the caption of the painting before us.\n\n\u201CThis is\
  \ the story of Princess Europa\u201D she relays with sadness, \u201Cbecause Europe,\
  \ a beautiful name, comes from two Greek words meaning open eyes.\u201D  \n\nShe\
  \ sighs, shakes her head a little, and we stand there for a while, my fellow human\
  \ beings and I, trying desperately not to blink."
