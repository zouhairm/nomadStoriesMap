Text: "I\u2019ve never thought that a hurricane could bring me so many joy and opportunities\
  \ to my life. In 2017 I was in Florida state doing an English course for non-native\
  \ speakers. In this same year, the hurricane Irma hit the Caribbean islands and\
  \ the U.S.A. I can remember the day when we received the notice about the hurricane.\
  \ All Floridians citizens and residents received the same message in their cellphones,\
  \ it was a hurricane alert message. My cellphone rang pretty loud at the same time\
  \ as my friends and my sister\u2019s cellphone. When we checked it up, it was the\
  \ hurricane alert. The hurricane Irma was predicted to hit Florida in a category\
  \ 3. A hurricane scale goes from scale 1 to 5, then the category 3 was just in the\
  \ average. All of it was new for me, as a Brazilian, I\u2019ve never passed through\
  \ an experience like that one. We don\u2019t have hurricanes in Brazil, and I didn\u2019\
  t know what to do and what not to do.\n\nWhen I chose Florida to make an English\
  \ course I was not expecting a natural disaster as one of my experiences abroad.\
  \ I went to my course on that day and the only subject that everyone was talking\
  \ was about the hurricane, and how bad was the experience with the last hurricane\
  \ Mathew. My first thought was, it\u2019s a joke and everything will be fine, but\
  \ it\u2019s just partially true. The hurricane was real, and it had already hit\
  \ some islands and it was about to hit Florida. \n\nThe tough to flee far away from\
  \ that hurricane was intense in mind. In that same day of the hurricane alert, I\
  \ went to Walmart to buy supplies for the \u201Cbig event\u201D. On Walmart, the\
  \ shelves weren\u2019t empty and everything was going just like a normal day in\
  \ Florida.\n\nMy plan to fly to another state went down the drain when the Governor\
  \ of Florida stopped the airports and nobody could leave or enter the state. On\
  \ Wednesday the hurricane had already made landfall in the northeast Caribbean.\
  \ While this monster was passing in the islands, the Governor of Florida pressed\
  \ us to evacuate the state by car.  At this moment my plans had changed, and I needed\
  \ to buy as much water and food as I could to the unexpected road trip. When I arrived\
  \ on Walmart to buy my supplies, the market was crowded, the shelves were empty,\
  \ and had a huge line to buy water. I could describe this moment like a scene of\
  \ an apocalyptic film, desperate people, empty shelves and suddenly the city was\
  \ starting to become empty. With all supplies in hand, we needed to make an escape\
  \ plan.\n\n\tFirstly we did not know where we would go until an old friend of my\
  \ father called him. He invited us to stay in one of his house in Indiana. Now we\
  \ had a route, Terre Haute. Before we left  Florida we prepared our house for the\
  \ hurricane. For that we put sandbags on the doors and windows, we also put as much\
  \ furniture as possible on top, just in case to have an inundation. After doing\
  \ all that, we started our long trip to an unknown place, it took us about 28 hours\
  \ on the road. The traffic was horrible, had moments that we stayed stuck in traffic\
  \ for about 1 hour. After this stressful travel by car when we arrived at our destination.\
  \ It was a small town, my first impression wasn\u2019t good. It was just like the\
  \ countryside, Terre Haute seemed to be pretty boring. There, I visited a University\
  \ and I ended up finishing my English course there.\n\nThe hurricane just helped\
  \ me to find a better school to improve myself and my English. In my first day of\
  \ class, I notice that my classmates were from totally opposite cultures. My classroom\
  \ was made from people of Mexico, Congo, Italy, Japan, China, Saudi Arabia and Brazil\
  \ ( I was the only Brazilian in this university). Then, we started to learn not\
  \ just about the English language, but, we also learned about the world, life, and\
  \ about respect."
