Text: "At 18, I left my home in Romania and flew to the U.S to live the dream. At\
  \ 21, I have lived in New York for the past 3 years, I had everything I thought\
  \ I wanted: a full scholarship, an education, friends I dreamed of, a team to hang\
  \ out with, but I didn't have one thing. I didn't have myself and I did not own\
  \ my actions. I was acting by default and I was not happy anymore because \"my dream\"\
  \ was not actually mine. It was other people's dream of me having a status quo,\
  \ pretending to be successful and happy by living in the \"concrete jungle\". In\
  \ December 2018, I could not breath anymore as I was draining in my own feelings\
  \ and thoughts. \"Whose life am I fucking living?\" - this question kept bothering\
  \ me day in and day out. I took one last breath in New York City, I dropped out\
  \ of college, I hugged all my beloved, marked my lips on their cheeks and on December\
  \ 18th, I flew to Mother Bali, not knowing if I was going to come back or pave my\
  \ own track. For one month straight, I was confused. I joined an amazing internship\
  \ at Karma House Bali, where we developed an awesome charity - #TheHappyMattressProject\
  \ - 100 beds for 100 Balinese kids in 100 days - we achieved our goal in less than\
  \ 20 days. And this is when the click happened. I fell in love with simplicity and\
  \ kindness, with spreading rather than taking, with loving rather than judging.\n\
  \nOn January 15th, I said \"New York, I will see you later!\" and this is how I\
  \ missed my flight back to America, but I boarded on the plane of my own life. Since\
  \ then, I haven't missed any other check - ins. I stayed in Bali for one more month...I\
  \ met Lina, the artist; Jeinar, the sweety pie; Luca, the Italian Dutchy; Alex,\
  \ the Californian Tarzan; Joel, the Mexican Zeus; and lastly I met myself... I started\
  \ reading people and not only books, I started watching them and not just movies,\
  \ I started living among people and not only among masks. I flew to Bali with a\
  \ damaged heart and a shaky confidence, with a troubled mind and an empty soul...\
  \ A week ago, I left Bali with a fixed heart, tranquil mind, wild soul and unshakable\
  \ confidence. I left New York with my brakes on, now I am cruising through life\
  \ with no brakes but with a love that can adjust any speed and direction. I came\
  \ back to Romania and I have seen beauty and possibility in places I didn't even\
  \ dare to look before. Out of fear, out of entitlement. \n\nMy travel story was\
  \ not a leap into the unknown, but that was the closest story theme that would make\
  \ for. My journey was an unassisted jump in a Black Hole, with a 21 year weight\
  \ of misconceptions wrapped around my ankles. I am here now, living a life I am\
  \ constantly changing and adjusting, but I am living my own life, on my own terms,\
  \ making sure I get to spread just one message: \"There's only one rabbit you have\
  \ to chase: your happiness. Everything else unfolds once you chase the root of all\
  \ magic!\""
