Text: "I went to Portugal with my girlfriend for eleven days. First we stayed in Praia\
  \ de Macas. The Beach and little town were nice. With our car we drove a short way\
  \ to Praia de Ursa and this was amazing. We were there two times, one time with\
  \ high tide and one with low tide. The beach and rocks are so great! We stayed there\
  \ till sunset and took lots of photos and videos.\n\nNext we went to our house in\
  \ Sintra. The nature and gardens around Sintra are really nice. Also Convent of\
  \ the Capuchos, Regaleira and our Favorite: Castelo dos Mouros. We had such a nice\
  \ view from this old castle. Sadly it closed 15 minutes before the final sunset,\
  \ but the time before was so great. Also there are less people before it\u2019s\
  \ closing and you have the best view at this time. Our host gave us the Queijadas\
  \ de Sintra. Wow they smelled so good. For us these were better than the Pasteis\
  \ de Belem (still very good).\n\nWe finished our trip with a nice three days in\
  \ Lisboa. Our favorite place there was LX Factory. Nice place to drink and to eat.\
  \ Also the view from Christo Rei is incredible.\n\nSo we had a really wonderful\
  \ time in Portugal and will come again!"
