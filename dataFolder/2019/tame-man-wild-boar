Text: "Looking over the menu, I saw something safe and familiar, with just enough\
  \ hint of the exotic to make me feel brave. \u201CWild boar honey sausage with crispy\
  \ bread.\u201D Sausage? No problem. Wild boar? Dangerous!\n\n\tAt 39 years of age,\
  \ I was on my second international journey.  A lifetime of dreaming about travel,\
  \ and I was finally doing it.  Everything felt new and strange.  This wasn\u2019\
  t some cool character in a movie, moving through exotic city streets with confidence.\
  \  This was me.  My eyes were wide, and I was trying with all my might to simultaneously\
  \ take in everything and not look like an idiot.  It was my first night in Florence,\
  \ Italy.  My partner and I were sitting in a small, family restaurant on a quiet\
  \ street, in a city I only knew from history books.  I was about to have real Italian\
  \ cooking.  Not Italian I used to get at the local joint in my small Maine hometown.\
  \ Not Olive Garden.\n\n\tThe waitress arrived to take our order.  Perhaps a bit\
  \ smug, I ordered the sausage.  I\u2019m not going to pretend I speak Italian. \
  \ Like many of my fellow Americans, English is my only language.  I\u2019ve found\
  \ throughout Europe, most people can spot Americans, and if not, they know when\
  \ we open our mouths.  They take pity by switching to English.  On the one hand,\
  \ I\u2019m always a bit ashamed I can\u2019t speak more of the local language. \
  \ On the other, I\u2019m relieved beyond words.  This waitress looked at what I\
  \ pointed to on the menu, then looked at me.  She took a moment to think about how\
  \ to be tactful and then she said it.\n\n\u201CSir, you know that this dish is served\
  \ raw?\u201D\n\nI\u2019m not a quick-witted fellow, but my brain did some amazingly\
  \ fast work in that moment.  Perhaps I could call it Social Algebra.  Raw meat is\
  \ bad.  Americans have a reputation for being somewhat boorish.  I\u2019m representing\
  \ my nation abroad.  This is a neighborhood restaurant; they\u2019re not going to\
  \ poison friends and family.  I\u2019m a coward in a foreign land.  When in Rome,\
  \ the saying goes.  I\u2019ve never particularly liked the taste of uncooked meat,\
  \ and only warmed up (sorry) to medium rare steaks in my late 20s.  I don\u2019\
  t want to be \u2018that guy.\u2019  I must be brave in the eyes of my lady love.\n\
  \n\tThis was the kind of speed calculation I hadn\u2019t been capable of since I\
  \ was a little kid trying to get out of trouble when my mother caught me doing something\
  \ wrong.  For just a moment, I saw the Matrix.  I was The One.\n\n\tIt all went\
  \ down in no more than a second or two.  I paused, in real time, for the briefest\
  \ of moments.  Then I broke out of my comfort zone and leapt into the great unknown.\n\
  \n\t\u201CThat\u2019s fine.\u201D\n\n\tI said it as though I ate the raw flesh of\
  \ wild boar every day.  I was Temujin.  I was Odysseus.  I was Beowulf.  I wasn\u2019\
  t just a paunchy middle aged American taking his first few baby steps into a larger\
  \ world.\n\n\tMy moment of exaltation was short lived.  I waited in nervous anticipation,\
  \ hoping beyond hope that I hadn\u2019t made a mistake, that I wasn\u2019t setting\
  \ myself up for a travel horror story.  After a few minutes the waitress brought\
  \ me the boar.  I sliced off a piece, put it on a bit of crunchy bread, breathed\
  \ in, and popped it in my mouth.\n\n\tIt was glorious."
