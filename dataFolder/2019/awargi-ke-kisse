Text: I went to rishikesh last year in the month of August. It was my road trip  with
  my family from sirsa (haryana) to rishikesh (uttrakhand) .we reached over there
  in early mrng around 5 am and we directly went to lakshman jhoola nd then i booked
  a room in a dharamshal kind of place just in front of lakshaman jhula. That place
  was quite amazing. The view from there of that entire place was spectacular. Everything
  seemed so amazing so natural. All the time we were there it was raining non stop.
  The weather was quite pleasant and relaxing. My family was too tired from the journey
  so they instantly slept when they checked in the room bt i didn't because i was
  damn excited to explore every single street of rishikesh. So i immediately took
  bath and got ready and did all puja and all things in the temple which was within
  the dharmshala nd just after that i threw my self in the local streets of rishikesh.
  First of all i had breakfast at a very nice restaurant just near Lakshaman jhoola
  and then i went to several ghats nd then to om triyambakam temple which has 12 floors
  which was damn amazing .i enjoyed the local beauty of that place. Mountains were
  so foggy and river water was so chilled and due to heavy rainfall the water level
  was increasing constantly. I explored the very places of that tourist place. It
  was all fun. And i really want to explore more and more local beauty of such amazing
  tourist places.
