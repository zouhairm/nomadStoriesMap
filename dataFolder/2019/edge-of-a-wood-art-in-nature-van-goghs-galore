Text: "Who would expect to find Van Gogh in a Dutch forest? De Hoge Veluwe National\
  \ Park, Otterlo was where I discovered Vincent Van Gogh with countless other artists\
  \ and sculptors.\nWhilst visiting friends in Akersloot, north of Amsterdam, they\u2019\
  d planned a quintessential Netherlands excursion \u2013 cycling alongside canals,\
  \ past windmills, picturesque villages, tulip fields. With the forecast dreary,\
  \ they suggested instead visiting the Kr\xF6ller-M\xFCller Museum, east of Amsterdam.\n\
  I had spent an afternoon at the Rijkmuseum, with several thousand of my closest\
  \ friends, vying to view the Vermeers and Van Goghs; queuing to even enter the room\
  \ with Rembrandt\u2019s 'Night Watch' \u2013 the frustrations of over-tourism. My\
  \ hosts assured me, \u201CKr\xF6ller-M\xFCller is different\u201D.\nAn easy hour\u2019\
  s motorway drive took us to the westernmost park entrance; I was lulled by the surrounding\
  \ forest\u2019s leafy lushness. Cyclists on White Bicycles, available free for loan,\
  \ rode leisurely along the myriad paths crisscrossing woods and grasslands. \nOutside\
  \ of the low-profile gallery, already there were sculptures and installations to\
  \ delight. No barriers separated patrons and artworks. Wenckebach\u2019s, now iconic,\
  \ 'Monsieur Jacques' stood as doorkeeper, bearing a striking resemblance to Alfred\
  \ Hitchcock. Later, we would enjoy lunch at the caf\xE9 named for this well-fed\
  \ gentleman.\nThe museum invites strolling; appreciating art from many angles. Moore\u2019\
  s chunky red travertine 'Sculpture with Hole and Light' left me speechless. Its\
  \ silky hardness, fluid lines and hollows beckoned. The guard, moving discreetly\
  \ forward, agreed with me, \u201CIt\u2019s tempting to touch. Thank you for not\
  \ doing so\u201D. Chastened, I retreated, dropping my hand, turning to be spellbound\
  \ by Marini\u2019s exuberant 'Horse and Rider'.\nQuickening steps and an obvious\
  \ buzz of anticipation was apparent as we neared the museum\u2019s heart, the Van\
  \ Gogh Gallery. \nThis gallery quietly boasts the world\u2019s second largest Van\
  \ Gogh collection. Ninety paintings and one hundred and eighty drawings, gathered\
  \ by Helene and Anton Kr\xF6ller-M\xFCller from 1908 to 1929 - their entire collection\
  \ a cultural endowment for the Dutch people. Did 'Edge of a Wood', her first Van\
  \ Gogh purchase, plant the seed for the site of Helene\u2019s grand gallery?\nOnly\
  \ forty of his works are displayed at any time; still it was breathtaking to view\
  \ such extraordinary art, arranged into Van Gogh\u2019s central themes. Works to\
  \ the left focus on nature; to the right on people. \nLooking ahead was a distraction,\
  \ so I imitated my artistic friend, absorbing each piece: the delicate 'Roses and\
  \ Peonies'; postman Joseph Roulin\u2019s flamboyant beard and the painting\u2019\
  s vibrant background; the drab ordinariness of 'The Potato Eaters', with Van Gogh\u2019\
  s preparatory portrait studies. I expected another security guard to intervene when\
  \ a man inclined inches from the mesmerising 'Caf\xE9 Terrace at Night' \u2013 gorgeous\
  \ golds, brilliant blues and the stars\u2026 Oh my stars! \nWhilst, undoubtably,\
  \ the Van Goghs are the superstars, every piece in this museum is stellar. Masterpieces\
  \ by Picasso, Mondrian, Monet, Seurat and many others express Helene\u2019s joyous\
  \ celebration of the development of modern art.\nAfter lunching with Monsieur Jacques,\
  \ our exploration continued into the Sculpture Garden. Paths meander through the\
  \ twenty-five acres of rambling parkland. There\u2019s no rush, no bustle. Adults\
  \ stroll, children tumble among trees, excitedly discovering surprises around each\
  \ bend as the 160 sculptures reveal themselves. \nEveryone gravitates to Dubuffet\u2019\
  s 'Jardin d\u2019email' \u2013 this mighty, floral, enamel work must be clambered\
  \ up to and over. Childish exuberance is encouraged for all ages. Here, you can\
  \ touch! For outside is hands-on art. Art that tempts, teases, intrigues, invites\
  \ \u2013 coarse, bronze spheres; chunky chairs for imagined conversations; Snelson\u2019\
  s Needle Tower to sit under, contemplating the clouds. \nAn older couple stroll\
  \ beneath an avenue of beech trees, oblivious to Penone\u2019s 'Otterlo Beech' hiding\
  \ in full view. Had they even realised, they might have found figures hidden in\
  \ the roots. Wending our way back past the small lake, with Pan\u2019s 'Floating\
  \ Sculpture, Otterlo' (an ever-shifting, giant bath toy), I delightedly discovered\
  \ Rodin\u2019s 'Squatting Woman' - one final star in this firmament.\nCollections\
  \ without crowds; room to roam and be captivated - Kr\xF6ller-M\xFCller Museum is\
  \ indeed different. Who could blame the Netherlands people if they kept this for\
  \ themselves, insulating it against the stresses of over-tourism? Had my friends\
  \ not shared this Dutch treasure, I would have remained none the wiser, none the\
  \ richer. Thankfully, they shared."
