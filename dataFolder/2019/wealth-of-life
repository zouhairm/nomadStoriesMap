Text: "\u201CHave you visited Taj Mahal?\u201D, from the other end of the phone, my\
  \ best friend back in my hometown asked me. I was in my third year of higher studies\
  \ in my ancestral country, India. I gave it a few seconds of silence before I answered,\
  \ \u201CNo\u201D. \n\nMy life had pretty much been normal and planned up. If there\
  \ is anything that my family would proudly award its generations would be for academic\
  \ excellence. Aside from the ideology, growing up in the bustling Jakarta had imbibed\
  \ me with the aims and goals revolving around achieving a remarkable career as well.\
  \ Perhaps, my grandparents had migrated from India to the Indonesian archipelago\
  \ with the same visions. I knew the world exists, but always made my own realm of\
  \ existence. Travelling, was an implication of wealth \u2013 set in my mind \u2013\
  \ which I would do once I am well-off, merely to boast it around. \n\nDuring my\
  \ formative years, my late mother would describe bits and pieces she heard from\
  \ her parents encircling the Country of the Indus and the heritages it bears. Subconsciously,\
  \ I started to wonder about the land of my origin. That curiosity led my decision\
  \ to pursue my undergraduate degree in India. It was a five-year stay. I never involved\
  \ myself into anything apart from the university and flying back home for pauses\
  \ till my third year. \nRecalling the question thrown upon me a few minutes earlier,\
  \ I realized that in the last three years I have not actually delved into this country\
  \ to discover the beauty hidden in the words of my mother.  Bearing no second thought,\
  \ I booked myself a fastest-train ticket to Delhi \u2013 that was my first train\
  \ journey \u2013 joined by some of my friends. \n\nAs the day approached, I was\
  \ jolted with the rush of excitement that I was not prepared for. It was a 28-hour\
  \ journey that broke all my scepticism about the idea of it. Making connections\
  \ with fellow travellers and perceiving their stories were juxtaposed with my prior\
  \ concept. After a long haul, the carrier pulled its break. I stepped out to a view\
  \ of commuting travellers, porters, shopkeepers, families \u2013 it could be the\
  \ same picture, it was still India \u2013 yet it was different. \n\nFollowing a\
  \ few hours of pleasant car journey from Delhi to Agra on the next day, I stood\
  \ with numerous inquests at the pass booth of one of the world wonders, Taj Mahal.\
  \ Owing myself an explanation I paid an audio guide to let it all hang out. While\
  \ I moved forth to unveil this amorous lady \u2013 as the Mughals referred it \u2013\
  \ I froze at the first sight of the magical white-marbled structure that fitted\
  \ its complete existence flawlessly against its archway. Enchanting in reality,\
  \ graceful yet impeccably bold, the so-called monument of love. I immersed myself\
  \ in the exploration. The birds chirping above the majestic dome, the shaft of sun\
  \ rays that are pierced through the Yamuna Ghat reflecting the intricate architecture,\
  \ the optical illusioned artwork put together, the parchinkari inlay amalgamated\
  \ in it. They flew as an ocean of unwavering emotions. \n\nTangled amidst the carved\
  \ pillars \u2013 of my own perception \u2013 this token of love commenced by Emperor\
  \ Shah Jahan for his consort, Mumtaz, had gifted me a treasure. I realized the world\
  \ is beyond my judgement. Conceivably, home is not wholly the place I had longed\
  \ to go back to every Summer or Winter intermission. A phrase I encountered in my\
  \ childhood, penned by an influencing Tamil poet \u2013 Avaiyaar, made sense that\
  \ moment, which translates as \u201CWhat you have learnt is as much as the amount\
  \ of sand held in your fist, whilst the knowledge is as big as the world itself.\u201D\
  \n\nThe short trip I took ripened as a path to my \u2018home\u2019, the sphere I\
  \ was given life at, which was yet to be embraced. With each further step, I have\
  \ been taking since then, I become more and more connected to this horizon of life.\
  \ Travelling \u2013 is, indeed, an implication of wealth \u2013 of knowledge."
