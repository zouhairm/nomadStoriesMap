Text: "Feeling adventurous, we made our way to the bus station in Penang and spent\
  \ the better part of an hour trying to find the right bus. The \u201Cbus terminal\u201D\
  \ was really just a series of retail stores on the side of a road.The only option\
  \ we had that day was an overnight bus that would take approximately 10 hours. It\
  \ departed at 9:00 PM so we assumed it would arrive in Kuala Besut around 7:00 AM.This\
  \ was also our first overnight bus experience in Malaysia. We had no idea that bus\
  \ drivers like to crank up the A/C to the point of freezing. We were unprepared\
  \ and did not bring a sweater or blanket. Sleep did not happen.At around 5:00 AM\
  \ the bus driver stopped at a dark, dusty intersection in a sketchy part of town\
  \ with only one street light. The town had a creepy vibe. The driver flicked on\
  \ the lights and began shouting at the remaining passengers. The bus had dropped\
  \ off many people along the way and the only passengers left were other backpackers,\
  \ obviously headed to the same tropical island destination.We could not understand\
  \ what he was saying but it was clear that he wanted us to get off the bus. He opened\
  \ the storage compartment underneath the bus and began unloading several over-sized\
  \ backpacks.\u201CPulau Perhentian, yes?\u201D he said with a devilish grin.\u201C\
  Yes. But where do we catch the boat?\u201D we replied, thoroughly confused and not\
  \ impressed that our backpacks were tossed on the dusty road.He smiled and nodded.\
  \ He clearly did not understand.Fortunately, one of the passengers could speak Malay,\
  \ so he translated. Apparently we had to wait at this dusty intersection in Jerteh\
  \ for 2 hours to catch a local bus to the ferry terminal. That was not a part of\
  \ the plan. We made it very clear when we purchased our bus tickets that Kuala Besut\
  \ was the final destination. There was no mention of a bus transfer.We finally arrived\
  \ at the Kuala Besut ferry terminal around 6:30 AM. Tired and cranky, we went to\
  \ the ticket window and learned that boat was not supposed to leave until 9:00 AM.Still\
  \ feeling confident from our recent negotiating success, we managed to convince\
  \ the boat driver to depart early because our group now totaled 11 backpackers.\
  \ It became clear that transportation availability is highly negotiable in Malaysia."
