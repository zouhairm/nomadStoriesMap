Text: "There's nothing easier than making a tired pilgrim happy. It takes a glass\
  \ of red wine, cold water to dunk tired and overheated feet into, a fresh slice\
  \ of watermelon, easygoing conversations after miles of nature sounds only.\nDuring\
  \ my travel by foot on the Italian Francigena route, I stopped for one day of rest\
  \ at Casa Lazzaro.\nOnce a Capuchin convent abandoned in the dust and the trash,\
  \ it was brought back to life by local nun Anna in 2003. Now it stands like a stone\
  \ jewel, nestled between the town of Acquapendente and the Laziale green, as an\
  \ oasis for travelers, who can take a break under its lived cloister or the gentle\
  \ shadows of the surrounding wood and orchard.\nAfter a communal dinner, the volunteers\
  \ invited us pilgrims to gather to the Casa\u2019s crypt. The room was chilly and\
  \ dark except for the flickering flames of little white ceremonial candles. We sat\
  \ in a circle on wooden church benches, still dressed in short pants, technical\
  \ t-shirts and overwashed socks. \nOur faces, baked by hours under the sun and shadowed\
  \ with fatigue, betrayed our curiosity. I could tell everyone was wondering what\
  \ we were doing there.\nThe quiet atmosphere felt heavy like a thick and warm sauna\
  \ fog: you could only hear our breathing and the noises of nervous foot tapping\
  \ on the floor while we were waiting for something to happen.\nThen Enzo, the head\
  \ volunteer, sat with us and took a paper out of his pocket.  During dinner he talked\
  \ and preached like a kind father, rough hands flailing to materialize unending\
  \ Christian faith in his words.\nHe stood still and serious as he started reading:\
  \ \u201CAs you set out for Ithaka, I hope your road is a long one, full of adventure,\
  \ full of discovery\u2026\u201D \nI was vaguely familiar with the poem: the verses\
  \ of the Greek author talked about life and finding Ithaka amidst monsters like\
  \ Ulysses did.\nAt the end Enzo faintly asked, voice echoing: \u201CWhy are you\
  \ doing this journey?\u201D\nThe silence that followed was unbearably awkward -\
  \ no one expected this to be a conversation and wanted to share his thoughts aloud\
  \ to almost strangers.  \nBut a man spoke up: \u201CMy destination is the Vatican.\
  \ I don\u2019t have much time left and this will probably be my last trip. I\u2019\
  m grateful I could leave. \u201C His hands were fidgeting and his eyes were glossy\
  \ with an emotion I couldn\u2019t name.\nIn the afternoon the same man lent me his\
  \ bar of soap and dispensed to me pilgrim life hacks confidently while I was washing\
  \ my clothes in the garden sink . \nI wondered if giving advices was a way to gift\
  \ others his experience before a terminal illness could rip it from him.  \nEverybody\
  \ was quiet when Mila\u2019s words broke the silence again.\nI knew her: I met the\
  \ old Dutch lady many times during my trip. With a bandana on her head and age lines\
  \ around her smile, she always seemed younger than everybody else in a room. I said\
  \ hello to her that same afternoon while she was helping the volunteers to cut potatoes\
  \ for dinner, singing Bella Ciao loudly and swaying her hips in the tiny volunteer\
  \ kitchen.\nIn her stilted English, she exclaimed: \u201CI\u2019m retired and I\
  \ traveled from the Netherlands to come here. Life isn\u2019t over when you are\
  \ old!\u201D. She was holding her husband\u2019s hand tightly. I felt myself smiling.\n\
  When she finished talking, there was a long pause. Someone coughed.\nI thought,\
  \ \u201CWhy am I doing this?\u201D.  Truthfully I was just filling my days with\
  \ incessant walking and new places because I hoped to escape from my anxious thoughts,\
  \ still attached to home yet intent on finding something at the end. \nPeace, maybe.\
  \ My Ithaka, I reasoned. \nHeart pounding, I told everyone my story. Probably. I\
  \ still don't remember what I said. \nThe session came to an end and the girl beside\
  \ stood up to hug her friend. For the first time during this trip I felt lonely,\
  \ but pleasantly so, as I embraced my daemons, my Cyclops. It was time to take my\
  \ backpack and go back to the road. Ithaka could wait."
