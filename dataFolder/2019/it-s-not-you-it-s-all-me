Text: "One. Two. Three. Four. I didn\u2019t stop counting the steady, almost numbing,\
  \ rattling sounds of the wheels of the tram, until a middle-aged woman in a dark\
  \ blue coat with a white and purple strip around one arm stumbling from one foot\
  \ to another waved at me and muttered: tickets please. After sliding my valid-for-two-weeks\
  \ ticket back into my purse \u2013 only foreigners buy that \u2013, I could finally\
  \ return to the sea of thoughts rhythmized by the pulsation of the vehicle that\
  \ all of a sudden meant the world to me. I\u2019m not a foreigner. I\u2019m home.\
  \ I find myself in two parallel realities as I gaze outside into the endless, delicately\
  \ flying fog. \nI have just finished an exam in one. I depart from the musty and\
  \ congested hallway of the university building and step out into the heat that causes\
  \ me to recoil. It\u2019s almost summer. The Danube looks calm from this side of\
  \ the city. I\u2019m pushed aside to the curb by an influx of people marching up\
  \ the subway stairs. It\u2019s rush hour \u2013 I think to myself. This is the fourth\
  \ time I\u2019m taking my routine route today. Class at eight in the morning, lunch\
  \ at home, exam at three \u2013 there, back, there and now back again. Once on board\
  \ of the tram, I seize a rear-facing seat \u2013 this was the best I could get and\
  \ I don\u2019t object. I free myself from the weighty purse that defies all characteristics\
  \ of an adequate school backpack and in a blink of a moment, my eyes are closed\
  \ and I\u2019m searching for the earphones hiding in that deviant, bottomless purse.\
  \ I am determined to forget about the sun burning adamantly through the untinted,\
  \ retro windows and the slight nausea triggered by the back-way travel. When I open\
  \ my eyes, we are in Buda, at the other side of the bridge. My trip was shortened\
  \ solely by one stop! Time must have stopped \u2013 I harshly conclude. Ten more,\
  \ ten more \u2013 I tell myself \u2013 and you are home. \nIn the second reality,\
  \ a thin layer of snow covers the landmark: the Gell\xE9rt Hill, the Liberty bridge\
  \ and the university building have dressed up in white, even the Danube decided\
  \ to stop flowing and act as a mirror showing Pest to Buda and Buda to Pest. The\
  \ minuses reign the temperature of these days, and I am wearing all the attire I\
  \ could fit in my suitcase. Still, I don\u2019t feel the cold. I\u2019m on the tram.\
  \ It\u2019s serene and quiet today. Everybody is at work and tourists occupy the\
  \ city in these daily hours. But I\u2019m not one of them. My two-week ticket smoothly\
  \ slights back into my purse and I gaze outside causing my body to be inundated\
  \ with joy and pride. The endless chain of bridges cuddling and holding the separated\
  \ land tightly, the magnitude of the Gell\xE9rt Hill leaning forward and adumbrating\
  \ the sleeping river, the Buda Palace smiling and greeting the Parliament on the\
  \ other side \u2013 they are all old friends, existing and breathing together winking\
  \ at each other as they notice my inner state. They have probably seen this before,\
  \ but I haven\u2019t. They seem apologetic and understanding, but I wrestle as guilt\
  \ crawls into my amazement and admiration towards this place that I call home.\n\
  I didn\u2019t expect to find the feeling of shame within myself triggered by this\
  \ mundane act: I visited my homeland. It was the abashment of the realization that\
  \ kept me paralized: I have changed. I have perceived the world wrong so far. Is\
  \ it right now? Have I become better? Or is it solely different? These questions\
  \ echo in my ears during all the ten stops on my way home. I don\u2019t have an\
  \ answer. But I do know one thing: it\u2019s not you, my dearest city, it\u2019\
  s all me."
