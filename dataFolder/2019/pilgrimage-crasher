Text: "At 3:00 AM, I found myself solidly in delirium sitting cross-legged on the\
  \ floor of the temple's upper level. My neighbors were close enough for me to feel\
  \ their warmth, the vibration of their chanting, and the rhythm of their swaying.\
  \ I swayed along with my head respectfully bowed and covered, but I peeked under\
  \ lowered lids at those around me who were reverently performing their devotion.\
  \ In my exhausted state, I suddenly wondered how I got there.\n\nThe invitation\
  \ was last minute, an opportunity to fill an empty spot in a truck heading north\
  \ to Punjab and the border of Pakistan with a few colleagues and friends on a road\
  \ trip for pleasure. Two of the travelers were Sikh, and one Sikh traveler, Guru,\
  \ revealed he had never made the pilgrimage to Harmandir Sahib, or Golden Temple,\
  \ so he had an ulterior motive. We arrived in the bustling town of Amritsar filled\
  \ with shops selling religious paraphernalia and colorfully dressed guards armed\
  \ with swords. When Guru had to negotiate vigorously for us non-Sikh companions\
  \ to be able to stay at a hotel near the Golden Temple, I began to worry. The invitation,\
  \ I had assumed, came with an understanding that I was allowed to be in this holy\
  \ place. When I expressed doubt, my friends reassured me. \"All are welcome.\"\n\
  \nThe Golden Temple was a magnificent sight. An ornate and somewhat boxy building\
  \ gleaming in gold with its perfect reflection in the surrounding pool. As we marveled\
  \ and strolled around the large pool, pilgrims bathed in the holy water and prepared\
  \ to enter the temple. After exploring the town and enjoying a meal, it was dark,\
  \ and I was road weary. But the evening was just beginning. Guru told us the worship\
  \ and ceremony he wanted to attend would be sometime in the middle of the night,\
  \ and we should all go with him to see the inside of the Golden Temple. So, late\
  \ in the night, we dressed and headed out to the ceremony. \n\nThe inside of the\
  \ temple was covered in gold and elaborately decorated similar to the outside, but\
  \ the atmosphere was hushed despite the crowd. I wandered around with eyes wide\
  \ as Guru named some of the holy items in locked cases. Suddenly, people were moving\
  \ into the temple quickly and finding places to sit on the ground. The chanting\
  \ began and went on for what seemed like hours. I tried to adjust my sleeping feet\
  \ without disturbing anyone as my eyes became dry and my head began to swim. The\
  \ fatigue along with the hypnotic sounds and movement rocked me into a deep meditation.\
  \ When it ended, I barely noticed the time passed until I tried to stand on my complaining\
  \ legs. As I walked out of the temple, I received the customary gift of Kara Parshad\
  \ in my cupped hands and left awed by the openness and generosity of the Gurdwara.\
  \ I ate the sweet gift with gusto and rubbed the ghee into my hands, filled with\
  \ gratitude at the experience.\n\nThe remaining ceremony was a blur of holy items,\
  \ swords, and speeches. After spending the whole night in and around the temple,\
  \ we finally went back to the hotel around dawn and slept like only all-nighters\
  \ allow. Our long drive back to Delhi was delayed by a morning detour to the Pakistan\
  \ border to see the border guard pomp, and I arrived home with just enough time\
  \ to pack my bags and call a taxi to the airport. As I took my seat on the plane\
  \ thoroughly exhausted, the whirlwind images of the last few days moved through\
  \ my mind, and I smiled at the serendipity of my last trip in India."
