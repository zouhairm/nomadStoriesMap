Text: "Until I visited Amazonia in July 2018, I had never heard of the Ticuna, an\
  \ indigenous people of Brazil, Colombia and Peru. When I planned to spend a few\
  \ days in Leticia, a small Colombian town surrounded by the Amazon jungle for miles\
  \ around, I was more appealed by the idea of carrying a chimpanzee or a sloth.\n\
  \nLooking at the endless forest through the plane\u2019s window, I was naively imagining\
  \ breathtaking landscapes, multicolored flowers and thousands of different animal\
  \ species. Having barely got off the plane and gasping for breath, due to the sticky\
  \ and dusty air, my shirt drenched with sweat; I assume all of this contributed\
  \ to reinforce the tropical image my younger self had always had about the Amazon\
  \ jungle. \n\nLeticia is located on the border of Colombia, Brazil and Peru. If\
  \ you wish to travel there from Bogot\xE1 or anywhere else in Colombia, you do not\
  \ have any choice but to take the plane, as the thickness and hostility of the rainforest\
  \ has - fortunately - prevented so far any malicious company from destroying its\
  \ biodiversity by building large highways. Then, its location makes it a heaven\
  \ for drug, gun or timber smugglers, but also for young tourists in search of adventure,\
  \ as we were at that time, my Colombian girlfriend, and I, freshly arrived from\
  \ France. \n\nAfter having navigated on the Amazon river, seen dolphins and, as\
  \ long dreamed, hold a sloth in our hands, we decided to be more \xAB\_adventurous\_\
  \xBB and to spend a night in the luxurious jungle, accompanied by a Ticuna guide\
  \ who would explain us everything about his community\u2019s culture, history and\
  \ language. We knew we would not take ayahuasca and undertake a spiritual trip;\
  \ however, we were both curious to be able to go deep into the jungle, and above\
  \ all, to learn more about an indigenous culture. \n\nObviously, the jungle was\
  \ not as colorful as my younger self had imagined. Yet, I was mesmerized by the\
  \ lush greenery and the richness of the biodiversity: I was deep inside the \xAB\
  \_lungs of the planet\_\xBB. Above all, I was amazed by our guide\u2019s faculty\
  \ to know every single plant or fruit and by his lecture course on \xAB\_how to\
  \ survive in the jungle\_\xBB: here, a tree whose red and cold bark can help cure\
  \ a headache if you stick it to your forehead; there, an edible fruit that you can\
  \ easily find in the rainforest. Though it is very unlikely to happen, if I were\
  \ to get lost in the Amazon jungle, I would certainly not be able to find my way\
  \ out; however I might survive two more hours thanks to him. \n\nThe coca leaf has\
  \ been brewed for tea and chewed for ages by indigenous peoples in the Andean region,\
  \ whether it is for medical or traditional use, and is a cornerstone of the indigenous\
  \ cultures. That night, as were listening to our guide\u2019s stories and the myths\
  \ the members of his tribe have been transmitting orally for centuries, we prepared\
  \ ourselves mentally to go hike in the jungle during the night. However, we did\
  \ not chew coca leaves or brew them for tea; we ground coca leaves in a metal container\
  \ under which we had set a fire, and our guide mixed them with the ashes from the\
  \ fire. \n\nI felt like my tong was anesthetized for a few minutes, as a tiny feeling\
  \ of euphoria was growing into me. It obviously did not last long, and the taste\
  \ in itself was not unbelievable. Nevertheless, that very night, before we went\
  \ out in the jungle, we could share a part of his culture with our guide, while\
  \ listening to his proverbs and myths. \n\nHaving lived in Colombia for several\
  \ months before this trip, I had had the opportunity to discover this country; I\
  \ had climbed El Pe\xF1ol of Guatap\xE9, admired the wax palms of the Cocora Valley\
  \ or danced cumbia in Cartagena. Yet, and as my experience in Leticia shows again,\
  \ there is always a part of mystery in this country. I guess that is what Garcia\
  \ Marquez\u2019s \xAB\_magical realism\_\xBB was about; and I guess it is one of\
  \ the main reasons why I love this country that much."
