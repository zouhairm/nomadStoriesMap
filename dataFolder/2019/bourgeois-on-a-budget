Text: "As a gay man backpacking solo through Europe on a tight budget, I didn\u2019\
  t expect to find myself in the audience of a 150-year-old Parisian theatre, crying\
  \ over the sight of a naked woman \u2013 yet there I was.\nMidway through a month\
  \ of hostel-hopping through Italy and France, a post popped up on my Instagram feed\
  \ advertising the 'Jean Paul Gaultier Fashion Freak Show' in Paris \u2013 which\
  \ happened to also be featuring an exclusive performance by burlesque icon Dita\
  \ Von Teese on the very weekend I was in the city.  After already two weeks of day-to-day\
  \ budgeting, the idea of spending a couple of hours pretending I was not poor whilst\
  \ watching a French cabaret with the local bourgeois crowd seemed very much appealing\
  \ to me, and with the sacrifice of a day\u2019s spending money I reserved myself\
  \ a single seat in the back row of the theatre.\nPutting on my best outfit (my only\
  \ pair of trousers with the least worn shirt in my suitcase), I made my way by foot\
  \ to the show\u2019s matinee performance \u2013 the Lafayette Boulevard creating\
  \ a gauntlet of Paris\u2019 worst winter weather for me, the sideways rain and strong\
  \ winds determined to make my appearance even more obviously not that of a fancy,\
  \ French local than it already was.\nThe venue of Gaultier\u2019s \u2018freak show\u2019\
  \ was to take place in the historical Folies Berg\xE8re, an 1869-built theatre which\
  \ has become a symbol of Parisian life through the famous performances that have\
  \ graced its stage.  Arriving early with my windswept, inside-out umbrella in tow,\
  \ the Folie Berg\xE8re\u2019s untouched interiors are a parallel world to the one\
  \ I was just walking through.  The lobby\u2019s mirrored walls reflecting the light\
  \ of a large chandelier as well numerous matching candle wall sconces, all working\
  \ together to illuminate the large staircase in the centre of the room, which is\
  \ also flanked with its own chandelier and set of candelabras, all flaunting the\
  \ not-so-subtle colour palette of blue, pink, purple, green and a dash of gold \u2013\
  \ if anyone was ever needing a physical definition of flamboyantly camp, I had found\
  \ it.\nUshers greeted me at the doors of the theatre\u2019s auditorium, busily running\
  \ to and fro to escort every guest to their seat.  With very little French vocabulary\
  \ under my belt, an usher explained my seat number to me in the local language,\
  \ but choosing to come across as stupid instead of just admitting my ignorance,\
  \ I nodded and smiled whilst making my way to a seat I assumed was mine.  As time\
  \ went on, I noticed as I was sitting in my seat that each guest would offer the\
  \ ushers a small tip once at their seats, not only did I now look stupid, I also\
  \ appeared stingy.\nThe show commenced, and a variety of acts took to the stage:\
  \ human-sized dancing teddy bears stripped, aerialists presented a repertoire of\
  \ mid-air sex positions, and dancers performed various choreographed routines supported\
  \ by live vocalists.  With my limited knowledge of the language, I spent much of\
  \ the time trying to make some sense of what I was witnessing, however, as the show\
  \ progressed I doubted knowing the language would have assisted in finding any cohesion\
  \ between the fun, yet odd, assortment of acts.\nFinally, a top-hat wearing silhouette\
  \ appeared on the stage, the music begun and the stage lights brightened, revealing\
  \ the mystery figure \u2013 Dita Von Teese.  Adorned in the most precisely fitted\
  \ black suit to accompany her hat, Dita, with the aid of two male assistants, began\
  \ to perform for the audience \u2013 without any apparent effort, her clothing began\
  \ to disappear from her body, soon dancing in nothing but a thong and nipple pasties.\
  \  Any attempt to describe the enchantment of watching Dita\u2019s body\u2019s discipline\
  \ throughout the performance would not provide justice to such a moment, and to\
  \ comment on the impressiveness of her snow-white skin only verges on sounding Jeffrey\
  \ Dahmer-esque \u2013 however, this was the moment I began to well with tears. Why?\
  \ Perhaps it was exhaustion from travelling, or the over-whelming realisation I\
  \ was the only non-French speaker in an audience of thousands, or maybe the fact\
  \ it was just a damn magical moment for little gay me."
