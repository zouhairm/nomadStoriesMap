Text: "The silken scarves and jewelled saris flashed by in glimmers of colour as our\
  \ rickshaw driver sped through the winding entanglement of alleyways in New Delhi.\
  \ A cacophony of spice traders, merchants, and chai-wallahs hawked their wares,\
  \ as barefoot children ran gleefully amongst the traffic, dodging and diving the\
  \ watchful adults. I was on a real-life roller-coaster, with no safety bar. Day\
  \ 1 in India and it was impossible to comprehend another 21...  \n\nPause. \n\n\
  This wasn\u2019t what I had anticipated getting off the plane.\n\nYou see, every\
  \ year the conversations seemed to get louder. No longer whispers about a place\
  \ on a bucket list, they were now anecdotes from friends, descriptive articles in\
  \ magazines, exuberant voices on podcasts. All singing from the same song sheet.\
  \ \u2018Go to India\u2019, they hushed. \u2018This place is more different than\
  \ you could possibly imagine\u2019, they murmured in excited tones.\n \nBut I\u2019\
  d always been a bit of a traditionalist with my travel. It\u2019d always been based\
  \ on preconceived notions of what I \u2018think\u2019 a place would be like. It\u2019\
  s hard not to do this, when we can \u2018see\u2019 what the world has to offer at\
  \ the push of a button. \n\nSo, when my partner decided to take up a Yoga Instructor\
  \ course in Goa, India, I wasn\u2019t overly enthusiastic. I had expectations of\
  \ a noisy, busy, polluted heatwave of a place, that would suck me in, chew me up\
  \ (whilst making me violently ill), and spit me out the other side, a little worse\
  \ for wear.\n\nI didn\u2019t expect to be wrong.\n\nI expected India to assault\
  \ my senses, but not to hit me in the face with whirlwinds of unimaginable colour,\
  \ smells of 1000 spices and fragrances, and voices of clarity, eagerness and desperation.\
  \ A choir of castes, breathing together in unison. I expected chaos, confusion,\
  \ and disorder. What I got was energy, enthusiasm, and an exploded sensory system.\
  \ \n\nI expected to be stopped in the street by beggars, but not by a young boy,\
  \ looking at me with an open smile and ball in hand, leading me between the melon\
  \ carts to where he and his sister were playing cricket. Barely an item of clothing\
  \ between them, yet the happiest people on the planet. \n\nI expected long monotonous\
  \ travel across dry arid landscapes... but not buildings the size of mountains,\
  \ with aeons of history oozing from, every brick. Temples, Palaces, and monuments,\
  \ murmuring to each other like old friends, stained in memories. \n\nI expected\
  \ to read arduous lines of history about forgotten photographs.  Instead I walked\
  \ in the footsteps of Mahatma Ghandi and was moved to tears in the very spot the\
  \ \u2018great soul\u2019 was assassinated, literally feeling an energy of a time\
  \ and people, who fought and strived for independence from imperial rule.  \n\n\
  I expected pollution, but not the overwhelming sadness at the sheer scale of human\
  \ trash visible on Chow patty Beach in Mumbai. A seething mountain of rubbish, akin\
  \ to a living, breathing organism. Getting bigger by the day, with nothing to combat\
  \ it or control it.\n\nI expected to keep my distance. I didn\u2019t expect to fall\
  \ in love with a country, and a people. I didn\u2019t expect to have \nmy opinion\
  \ of a place turned, twisted, and flipped on its head, all in the space of 3 weeks.\
  \ I barely kissed the surface of this vast expanse of land they call Bharat. But\
  \ the taste of the surface was enough for me to want so much more.\n\nQuite simply,\
  \ I left India feeling inspired. A country of over 1.3 billion people, a mass of\
  \ religion, culture, and comradeship. Nothing should work in this place. Nothing.\
  \ Resources are stretched well beyond their limit. But you can\u2019t help but notice\
  \ an industriousness, and assiduousness. From the spice traders of Mumbai to the\
  \ Gondola punters of the Backwaters, people are busy, and these people are just\
  \ so very inspiring.  \n\nMakes you think\u2026. Maybe we should just remove expectations,\
  \ stereotypes and premonitions. Maybe the best way to travel is just to let go \u2026\
  \ and see what comes.\nBecause when you do, wonderful things can happen. Things\
  \ you don\u2019t expect.\nAnd maybe, just maybe\u2026. That\u2019s what travel is\
  \ all about."
