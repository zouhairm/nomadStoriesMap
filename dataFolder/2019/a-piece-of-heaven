Text: "Born in a third world country, you never even think about exploring your own\
  \ country. You take every chance you get to hop on that plane and go somewhere abroad\
  \ and explore the world. I made the same mistake. Being born in Pakistan and living\
  \ there for 18 years i never really though that there was anything to explore here.\
  \ I took every chance to go to Europe and Americas. Until finally, when I decided\
  \ to go back home for Summer vacations was when I along with my friends made a random\
  \ and quick plan to visit Gilgit- Baltistan Province of Pakistan. Instead of flying\
  \ of there we decided to drive up there. It took 3 stops and 2 days to finally reach\
  \ Gilgit Baltistan, and It is only fair to say that this road trip changed my life.\
  \ I discovered the beauty that i never did while travelling anywhere else in the\
  \ world. I discovered peace, I discovered hospitality. The beauty that left us all\
  \ mesmerized. The mountain ranges that felt like portraits made up in the sky, the\
  \ fast gushing rivers whose sound just left the ears wanting more. I discovered\
  \ that a country, my country  which is popularly known to the media for being unsafe\
  \ has a region which has never even been reported to have a crime. Zero crime rate!\
  \ Yes! \nWe stayed at the Shangrila Resort, the resort is located right beside the\
  \ Attabad lake, which is the most blue and beautiful lake that my eyes had ever\
  \ seen. The lake also offers plenty of water activities for the the water enthusiasts.\
  \ And the peace loving people the resort offers an amazing bonfire, where you can\
  \ just sit and relax, roast some marshmallows and watch sky full of stars while\
  \ the sound of waters and springs calms your ears."
