Text: "\u201CGood Afternoon ladies and gents. My name is Sydney and I will be your\
  \ guide. Today we will take the boats on the river and we will go down right before\
  \ you\u2026plop! Over the falls. Hopefully we don\u2019t lose anyone\u201D he said\
  \ laughing followed by nervous giggles from the group.\n\nWe had arrived the day\
  \ before at the Epupa Falls on the Kunene River, which forms a natural border between\
  \ Namibia and Angola. Lined with palm trees and strips of beach with the sound of\
  \ rushing water, it was a paradise in the dry desert.\n\nEveryone stood to attention\
  \ as Sydney starting explaining the safety rules: \u201CYou put the life jacket\
  \ on, over your head and you tighten it like this\u201D demonstrating on my father,\
  \ who didn\u2019t seem too impressed by the flimsy floating device, that barely\
  \ covered his big belly. \u201CThank you Sir, now ladies and gents when the water\
  \ gets a bit choppy, you hold onto the boat and you put your oars in the boat. Don\u2019\
  t lose your oars! You\u2019re going to need them!\u201D Knowing that at the end\
  \ of the river was a 37 metre drop of crushing water. I quietly repeated to myself:\
  \ \u201Cdon\u2019t lose your oars.\u201D A futile attempt to reassure myself. We\
  \ were then loaded onto the back of an old truck, boats and all along a little dusty\
  \ track. We passed the local Himba village, where the women gathered outside their\
  \ huts. With their children nestled between their legs and vigorously rubbing their\
  \ dry bodies with otjize. A natural ointment made from butterfat and plant resins,\
  \ which coloured their skin red, similar to the cloud of dust that was following\
  \ the old truck as it made its way. It seemed like a very long drive being tossed\
  \ back and forth when eventually we turned towards the river.\n\nThe boats were\
  \ quickly unloaded from the truck, and we were left standing along the cool flowing\
  \ waters of the Kunene. Once on the river, Sydney started to point out interesting\
  \ birds and animals along the river banks, to our left and right. He guided us to\
  \ a little island in the middle of the wide Kunene. With only large rocks and reeds\
  \ as inhabitants and a small sign reading \u201Cno man\u2019s land\u201D. \n\nSydney\
  \ started recalling stories of the border war fought on this very river. Telling\
  \ us how the soldiers of the SWAPO (South West African People's Organization) would\
  \ attack the SADF (South African Defiance Force) at night by crossing the river\
  \ with the cattle from the local village. Huddling closely to the cattle and becoming\
  \ nothing but anonymous dark shapes of the river, the perfect ambush in a war later\
  \ known as the Bush War. The river that was quiet and peaceful, became a war zone.\
  \ A war that many have forgotten and with it the lives of those who were lost. For\
  \ a moment, Sydney stands in silence along with my father, who recalls his own memories\
  \ as a solider. Sydney breaks out a smile and says: \u201CThere is a strong solider,\
  \ who was injured and survived\u201D We all look at him with puzzled expressions,\
  \ wondering what solider still lives here\u2026Sydney starts to giggle and says:\
  \ \u201CIt is our crocodile. You might find him lying on one of the many other islands\
  \ and rocks or maybe even this one. But this poor croc, is an injured solider, it\
  \ has only 3 legs! He lost it during one of the fights. This croc is my protector,\
  \ he looks after us and the river.\u201D\n\n\u201CRight ladies and gents, let\u2019\
  s get back onto the water and maybe we can find our friend, the croc.\u201D said\
  \ Sydney as he started making his way to the boats. With slight hesitation, we got\
  \ back onto the water. And as we made our way down the river, I was looking towards\
  \ the river banks of Namibia, with the warm sun beating down on the red soil, and\
  \ with the palm trees waving in the gentle breeze, and in the distance, lay a large\
  \ mass of grey and green. Sydney caught my eye and with a quick grin, he pointed:\
  \ \u201Cover there, my croc.\u201D"
