Text: "When I flew out of Montreal on January 1st (my extreme version of new year\
  \ new me) I certainly had not expected to find a woman who would glimpse into both\
  \ my coffee and my future the very next day. It was at the end of a long a maze\
  \ of alleyways that sprawled shisha bars, street vendors and countless cats (Istanbul\u2019\
  s unofficial watchdogs) that I found the Majestic Cafe. A cold rain had been falling\
  \ all day. Although I found the white fog enveloping the city to exude mystical\
  \ warmth (I give credit to the lively artistic youth and the fivefold daily prayer\
  \ calls), I was suffering through a particularly nasty episode of jet lag and had\
  \ been walking up and down busy streets for many hours. I sure was looking forward\
  \ to a hot cup of Turkish coffee. \n\nThe third floor caf\xE9 was virtually empty\
  \ except for a few kittens napping the afternoon away on purple cushions and a turtle\
  \ hanging out in a wide aquarium. When I asked a human for coffee I was informed\
  \ that I could pay the equivalent of two more dollars and get a reading. 80s music\
  \ was playing from speakers I could not see. \u201CA reading?\u201D was my confused\
  \ reply. The man explained to me that some gifted people in Turkey made a living\
  \ out of reading the fortune of customers by analyzing their leftover coffee grounds.\
  \ Why not.\n\nI sat and looked around and made eye contact with a black kitten that\
  \ had just woken up and was stretching around. On my right a lady with big curly\
  \ hair and long green nails and a cigarette hanging from her lips was doing a tarot\
  \ reading for a woman who seemed to be all ears. When I got my coffee I let it slowly\
  \ take the chill off of me as I read a collection of short stories that had been\
  \ given to me by a friend: \"Fairytales for Lost Children\" by Diriye Osman. The\
  \ harsh truth was that it was only the first day of my trip and I was feeling utterly\
  \ lost. I had recently graduated from university and I worried that I was poorly\
  \ masquerading an escape from the responsibilities of adulthood as a self-discovery\
  \ trip. I had always been skeptical by nature but I was anxious for someone to tell\
  \ me it was all going to be okay and I was ready to give a Turkish fortune teller\
  \ a shot. I mean, why not.\n\nI got to read through three stories, all of them featuring\
  \ young people on the brink of self-revelation, when I was asked to flip my cup\
  \ upside down on the saucer and swirl it three times counterclockwise in order to\
  \ loosen the sediments inside. I had to wait five nervous minutes for them to drain\
  \ down. The fortune teller turned out to be a kind-eyed girl who I estimated to\
  \ be just about my age. She inspected the dried coffee inside the cup, on the saucer\
  \ and then inside the cup again. She spoke no English so a translator described\
  \ to me in eerily precise details a toxic dynamic that defined my family life and\
  \ correctly identified its source. He advised me to take the opportunity that would\
  \ soon present itself to me for it would turn into something great no matter what\
  \ the odds initially looked like. \u201CSomething about culture,\u201D was what\
  \ he repeated several times. He announced a sickness and a pregnancy and a long\
  \ trip composed of many short ones. I thanked them both and left with my understanding\
  \ of the universe a little shaken. The rain had stopped.\n\nI have now been on this\
  \ trip for six weeks and that first day seems to be from a distant past. In my travels\
  \ I have discovered the stories of many and have been writing one in the form of\
  \ a novel. I no longer think that I am running away from my responsibilities - I\
  \ am embracing the uncertainty that lies behind life and its opportunities. I am\
  \ writing something about culture and I think it could turn into something great."
