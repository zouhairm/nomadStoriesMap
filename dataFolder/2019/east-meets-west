Text: "The taxi took a mere 20 minutes through the noisy, polluted traffic of Kathmandu,\
  \ where my plane had landed, until it reached Boudhanath, the second greatest settlement\
  \ of Tibetans outside of Tibet. After settling into the simple but clean and airy\
  \ concrete room of the nepalese guesthouse in Boudhanath, I decided to immediately\
  \ explore the place, in order to find something to eat. I had not eaten anything\
  \ at all besides a tepid morning tea in the guesthouse in Thamel, the touristic\
  \ area of Kathmandu, where I had spend my first night. It had not been a lucky choice\
  \ and after a rather sleepless night, I had been too eager to find my way out of\
  \ it, to consider a more substantial breakfast. So as soon as I had my bags stored\
  \ in the room of the guesthouse and the key to it in my pocket, I stepped out into\
  \ a small gardened compound before reaching the gate. In the crisp nepalese mountain\
  \ air, I started walking towards the Stupa, the centre around which the Settlement\
  \ had been built: a huge, sacred, ancient Tibetan Stupa in the midst of Nepal, that\
  \ small, unknown country in the high mountains of the Pre-Himalaya. It was such\
  \ a different setting than the one I knew. Walking through the small, winding streets\
  \ full of Tibetan monasteries of all sizes and small shops with everything a Tibetan\
  \ household or a religious offering would require, shops full of little statues,\
  \ cooking vessels, pulses, fruit and much more, I was stunned to find myself very\
  \ unexpectedly in what seemed to be a completely self-contained little and very\
  \ busy world full of diversity and colour. Tibetan monks with robes of the different\
  \ denominations they belonged to, and of varied ages, from school-aged little boys\
  \ to old, wrinkled men, were peacefully walking the streets under colourful umbrellas\
  \ to protect themselves against sun and rain. A black thin stray kitten approaching\
  \ my walking feet with big hungry eyes, Tibetan housewives hurrying along in their\
  \ Tibetan traditional dresses with the long decorative apron of a married woman.\
  \ Guesthouses and shops of all types sprinkled along those little labyrinths of\
  \ cobbled streets, I walked down the external walls of monasteries decorated in\
  \ gold with dragon-heads and paradise-birds. I did not really choose my way, it\
  \ led me by itself towards the centre of it all, the Stupa, enormous, magnificent\
  \ and yet humble in the simplicity of its paintings and its colouring, set against\
  \ the impressive sky at such an altitude, a thousand little prayer-flags moving\
  \ in the wind. Monks, housewives, tourists, shopkeepers, all of them busying themselves\
  \ in different ways around it, praying, taking pictures, calling out to sell merchandise.\
  \ \n\nI spotted one of the little caf\xE9s and stepped up to the first floor, found\
  \ an empty table in the terrace, sat down and looked straight upon the upper part\
  \ of the Stupa, with its painted eye, white and grey clouds so close they seemed\
  \ tangible objects, so beautiful they seemed painted on the clear blue sky. Monks\
  \ sitting at the tables around me, as well as tourists and pilgrims. At a table\
  \ to my right, a saffron-clothed monk playing with his cellphone, at the other table\
  \ two monks vividly engaging in a philosophical conversation with a tourist. No\
  \ introspected, silent practitioners here. Chatty, joyful eyes, full of life, hilarious\
  \ laughter now and then. Very much alive and very happily interacting with the colourful\
  \ world of individuals coming from all stages of life, from all countries around\
  \ the world. A place where worlds meet, East and West, mundane and spiritual, in\
  \ happy chatter, each one hungrily taking in the other. Monks happy for the exchange,\
  \ the breaking of the routine, the taste of the outer world. Travellers stepping\
  \ - often for the first time and only time - out of their mainstream busy schedules\
  \ into the exotic world of Eastern monastic life, philosophy lived through monks\
  \ garments, gaining insights into the awareness of secluded, disciplined, meditating\
  \ minds. Minds that turned out to be very lively and eager to interact."
