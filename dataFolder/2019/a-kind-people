Text: "Driving from Gorizia to Grado, we stopped at the cemetery where our friend\
  \ Robs' mother was buried. We paid our respects and continued on to Grado where\
  \ we would meet some of Rob's family. Grado is a small, beautiful beach town on\
  \ the Adriatic sea and the people there don't see many Americans, mostly European\
  \ visitors on holiday. After a long and delicious meal at a local restaurant with\
  \ great conversation, we walked to the families small hotel and sat in the courtyard\
  \ laughing and talking, well trying to talk, with broken Italian and broken English.\
  \ The people were kind and sincere and the conversation was good. After an initial\
  \ day in Venice and the next day in Gorizia, Grado felt like the real start to meeting\
  \ the people of Italy. \n\nAs we left Grado, I knew one day I would return. The\
  \ history, the sea, and especially the people, still beckon me to return. Driving\
  \ to Tuscany, my husband became ill, very unusual for him. Rob handled all of the\
  \ driving. As we made our way to our Agriturismo, Fonte Bertusi in Pienza, night\
  \ set in. \n\nWhen we arrived we found our apartment. Tom was very sick and we had\
  \ no food so off we went to find food while Tom tried to get warm. We drove and\
  \ drove but it was almost 10 pm and what we did find was closed. Finally, we came\
  \ across a small bar that appeared to be ready to close as well. \n\nWe went in\
  \ and spoke with the owner of the bar, explaining we had just arrived and we were\
  \ looking for dinner. He went to his own kitchen and made use sandwiches to take\
  \ back with us and wouldn't let us pay. I paused for a moment, soaking in the genuine\
  \ kindness we had just experienced. WIth food and wine in hand, off we went back\
  \ to our apartment. \n\nDuring the night, Tom's fever grew very high and he was\
  \ having trouble swallowing. It was at that moment I realized what I had missed\
  \ while I planned every detail of our first trip to Italy and that was what to do\
  \ in a medical emergency. I was in a foreign country, I didn't speak the language,\
  \ I had no idea how to get help. Desperate, I called my sister, a nurse, at home.\
  \ She talked me through my fear and suggested finding predizone the next morning.\
  \ \n\nAfter a sleepless night, I awoke to find Tom's fever had broken. I went to\
  \ find breakfast and met the owners. three wonderful souls. They sent me back with\
  \ a tray full of food for my husband. Afterwards, we drove to town and found the\
  \ medication for Tom. \n\nWhere ever we went, people would smile at us and when\
  \ I tried to speak Italian and trampled on the words, they would patiently help\
  \ me pronounce the words, all the while smiling. I never felt concerned about where\
  \ I was or getting by because the friendly faces of complete strangers made me feel\
  \ safe and welcome. It was hard to leave this wonderful country. My husbands' heritage\
  \ was here and I knew as we left Rome, we would return. \n\nToday, I stay connected\
  \ with many people I met on that trip through Facebook and I dream of the Tuscan\
  \ hills, the history, the beauty, and the people we met that welcomed us without\
  \ hesitation. \n\nOne day, I will return and enjoy reuniting with these kind people."
