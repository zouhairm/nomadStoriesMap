Text: "An orphan, my great-great grandfather made the treacherous sea-voyage from\
  \ India to South Africa under the \u201Csupervision\u201D of his second-uncles.\
  \  They hoped for a better life - they ended up as indentured labourers sugar cane\
  \ plantations.  Hard, back-breaking work with little reward.  \n\nMy great-grandmother\
  \ did a little better.  She was married off to a shop keeper\u2019s son.  My grandfather\
  \ grew up sleeping on tomato boxes.  My grandmother was taken out of school to cook,\
  \ clean and take care of her younger siblings.  My father had to find work straight\
  \ after school to support his family.  \n\nMy ancestors toiled hard so that we could\
  \ have the quality of life that they couldn\u2019t imagine in India.  And now, we\
  \ were going back.    My parents wanted to visit India to pay homage to our motherland.\
  \  As a sixth generation African-born I felt it a kind of betrayal \u2013 as if\
  \ we were acknowledging a bond to a country other than my own South Africa.  \n\n\
  En route to New Delhi, I mused over the juxtaposition of our journeys.  Mine, in\
  \ an airconditioned plane with two meals, snacks and a glass of wine - compared\
  \ to that of a 12-year-old boy leaving his home through a danger filled port in\
  \ Calcutta.  My expectations were not high: noise, pollution, dirt, traffic, hooting,\
  \ smog, beggars...  I\u2019m ashamed to think that I had already made up my opinion\
  \ of the country from media and what others had told me of their visits.  \n\nWhen\
  \ we arrived, Aman, our energetic young tour guide welcomed us with garlands made\
  \ from pungent marigolds.  On the way to our hotel in an air conditioned mini-bus\
  \ he pointed out local landmarks and gave us an idea of the attractions that we\
  \ couldn\u2019t afford to miss out on.  I was tired and grubby, but his excitement\
  \ was rubbing off on me.  I wanted to see more of this city that my blood was part\
  \ off.\n\nEarly the next morning, we drove to the Qutab complex.  Driving in Delhi\
  \ is an artform.  Back home, my father is infamous for his ability to weave through\
  \ traffic.  In Delhi, his manoeuvres seemed like child\u2019s play.  Where the road\
  \ was marked for four lanes, there were six rows of traffic.  No one seemed to obey\
  \ the traffic signals and somehow, there were no accidents.  The Qutab Minaret is\
  \ neighbour to an odd, but interesting, mix of Hindu and Islamic architecture: a\
  \ 12th century mosque built from the portions of 27 Hindu and Jain temples, as well\
  \ as a 5th century iron pillar used for Hindu worship.  \n\n After feeding the bright\
  \ green parrots with seeds bought from some local children, Aman took us back to\
  \ the city, to the Jama Masjid -  a 17th century mosque built by the notorious Emperor\
  \ Shah Jahan.  As it is a practising mosque, we hired thawbs, long sleeved, ankle\
  \ length robes and entered.  Back home in South Africa, Indians - as an ethnicity\
  \ - are a minority group. Our culture, be it of a Hindu or Islamic background, is\
  \ generally viewed as exotic.  As I grew up in a mixed community, I\u2019ve always\
  \ had to justify our conservative traditions to my friends.  Not having to debate\
  \ the reasonableness of the thawb was strange and liberating in a way.  The sincerity\
  \ of the worshippers\u2019 faith was breathtaking against the combination of marble\
  \ and red sandstone architecture.  In the courtyards, families sat against walls\
  \ decorated in old calligraphy scripts.  The sense of peace was a jewel in the bustle\
  \ and noise of Delhi.\n\nWith only breakfast lining our growling bellies, Aman arranged\
  \ for bicycle rickshaws to take us for a snack in the adjacent Chandni Chowk, a\
  \ bustling market place.  The smell of spices reminded me of home.  In a grimy tea-room\
  \ in the market, Aman ordered aloo parathas \u2013 curried potato filled flatbreads.\
  \  Instinctively I tucked in using my fingers.  Out of habit I looked up to see\
  \ who would be watching me eat in such an \u201Cunrefined way\u201D.  \n\nNo one\
  \ was.  Eating without cutlery is the norm in India.  I was normal, not exotic or\
  \ weird.  I belonged.  It was in this moment I realised that I am African \u2013\
  \ and Indian."
