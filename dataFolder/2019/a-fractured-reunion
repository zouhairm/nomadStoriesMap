Text: "It was my cousin\u2019s wedding.\n\nIt was my cousin\u2019s wedding and I didn\u2019\
  t know. \n\nI didn\u2019t know who she was or who she was marrying and I arrived\
  \ like an unwanted intruder on the day her life would change. I followed your advice,\
  \ baba and left to see the place you dreamt of and had never seen. And now here\
  \ I am, helping your family on the other side of the border to make payesh (a sort\
  \ of rice-pudding) as the children of the house look at me curiously. \n\nIt was\
  \ my cousin and I didn\u2019t know her.\n\nYou never told me about her baba or maybe\
  \ you didn\u2019t know either. You were always one who looked at the past and never\
  \ moved on. \nI stirred the milk in the pot and watched my aunt pour the jaggery\
  \ into the swirling mix. \u201CWhere is the rice Rana?\u201D she called in Bengali.\
  \ \u201CAre there no helpers around other than family?\u201D I asked. \u201CNo,\u201D\
  \ she said, \u201CHer wedding is small and only family, she decided.\u201D \n\n\
  Family, I thought. How does one whose existence was never known earlier become family?\
  \ You would have asked that baba. But I won\u2019t. \nI watch the peas being poured\
  \ into the vegetables and stirred over a low fire when I see my cousin stand by\
  \ the door her hands patterned with henna folded over her red sari. I got up and\
  \ walked towards her as she smiled at me. \u201CLong time no see sis?\u201D she\
  \ laughed as she wrapped her arms around me as we walked to her room where a few\
  \ friends were laughing uncontrollably.\n\nShe sat in front of the mirror and opened\
  \ her box of red lipstick and looked at me in the mirror. \u201CSo, how do I look?\u201D\
  \ she asked, her kohl layered eyes gazing at me. \u201CYou look beautiful\u201D\
  \ I smiled. \u201CHmm,\u201D she continued, \u201CYou have your Dhaka accent.\u201D\
  \ \n\n\u201CMost of it,\u201D I reminisced,\u201D The ones I managed to salvage\
  \ in spite of being ridiculed at school.\u201D She looked at my reflection for some\
  \ time while fiddling with her ring and then got up abruptly. \u201CDo you still\
  \ have the diaries your grandfather wrote his military and daily expenses in?\u201D\
  \ she asked. \u201CUmm...yes, my baba has them.\u201D I said startled. \n\n\u201C\
  You have been helping with the food all evening. Don\u2019t you want to see the\
  \ house he lived in?\u201D  \n\nYes, I would love to, I answered. We went down the\
  \ stairs and stood outside the door as a friend of hers rushed in \u201COh where\
  \ are you going Rubi?\u201D she asked, \u201CWe should be getting late.\u201D \u201C\
  Don\u2019t worry, I\u2019m just showing my cousin her grandfather\u2019s house,\u201D\
  \ she laughed. The friend tilted her head and looked at me with surprise, \u201C\
  Cousin? How come I never saw you around?\u201D she asked. My sister laughed and\
  \ told her \u201CDon\u2019t bother her now Lila. Rohini is waiting for you upstairs.\u201D\
  \ \n\nShe pointed at a large house a few meters away. It was partially lit up and\
  \ there were people standing on the balcony, their saris waving in the cool evening\
  \ wind. \u201CWho lives there now?\u201D I asked. \u201CYour grandfather\u2019s\
  \ brother\u2019s family. They did not choose to leave during the riots. Did your\
  \ baba not tell you about this?\u201D \n\nNo, I reply, there was a lot he did not\
  \ say. Maybe it was too painful to bring up stories of a homeland he had never seen\
  \ and always wanted to return to.\n \nPerhaps he thought a child growing up decades\
  \ later in Kolkata would never understand what it was. \n\nThat\u2019s where he\
  \ was wrong, I decided as I crossed the shadowy road and walked up the steps to\
  \ my ancestral house. I saw a man strolling out of the house dressed in pajamas\
  \ along with a few children laughing around him with sweets in their hands.\n\n\
  I walked up to him. \u201CHello, Uncle,\u201D I said in Bengali, \u201CYou will\
  \ not recognise me.\u201D"
