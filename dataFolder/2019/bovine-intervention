Text: "I was elated to be in Mumbai, but how to spend my first day? I decided that\
  \ the Markets and Souks were where I would end up if left to my own devices, so\
  \ why not just take a local tour? The only tour available would be auf Deutsch.\
  \ \n\nDie M\xE4rkte von Mumbai began at 3:00pm, well into the most sweltering heat\
  \ of the day. I had always envisioned the Indian markets as a rough-hewn Pier One\
  \ Imports, minus the stemware and potpourri. My utopian notions were dashed when\
  \ we arrived at the Crawford Market, a warehouse style indoor/outdoor bizarre -\
  \ an epicenter for spices, produce, and animals. The Beasties were to be sold as\
  \ pets, not groceries. Nonetheless, they were crammed into cages and stacked on\
  \ top of one another, a m\xE9lange of breeds and species. Our guide Nira, spoke\
  \ flawless German, but with a bouncy cadence not normally associated with the language.\
  \ Nira ushered us through the market, a patient and comforting touchstone amidst\
  \ the mayhem. We attracted a throng of small children; an enterprising few were\
  \ begging or peddling trinkets, but most of them were transfixed and probably amused\
  \ by the milling throng of cargo pants and neon visors.\n\nThe second market we\
  \ visited, the Chor Bazaar (Thieves\u2019 Market) is infamous for peddling recycled\
  \ stolen goods. Such a cacophony of sounds, crammed bodies, vehicles, and beasts\
  \ - all vying for the limited turf within the crowded streets and crumbling buildings!\
  \ \n\nA fellow traveler complained that we were whipping through this market without\
  \ being given sufficient time to browse at any of the stalls. In the nick of time\
  \ and right before an uprising, Nira explained to us her master plan: \u201CEs gibt\
  \ viel besserre Sachen bein naechsten Markt.\u201D There is much better stuff at\
  \ the next market. Then in an attempt to uplift the group\u2019s dour mood, she\
  \ led us to a cow stall along the outskirts of the market. The cows, being sacred\
  \ and all, were habitually fed sugar by families with small children, hoping to\
  \ gain favor and good luck. And crows, being vile and disgusting, came to graze\
  \ on the prolific cow-patties produced by the sacred beasts. Akin to Hitchcock in\
  \ Bollywood, behemoth black birds overran the trees. \n\nI should have seen it coming\u2026\
  I suddenly had the sensation of an egg breaking on my head, and then it ran onto\
  \ my cheek\u2026Standing in what was perhaps the filthiest most rancid smelling\
  \ place I have ever been - an avian scavenger, a winged rat - defecated on my head!\
  \ No one in my group even noticed, but a local man stared at me as if frozen in\
  \ time, his next movement seemed contingent upon my reaction. \n\nWell, my reaction\
  \ was to pretend it didn\u2019t happen; I\u2019m not sure what dignity I thought\
  \ I was preserving with excreta dripping down my neck. I ducked around the corner,\
  \ scoured myself with Purell and Wet Ones, and rejoined the group.\n\nWe schlepped\
  \ back to the bus, retracing our tracks through the souk; by now, it was rush hour,\
  \ thus augmenting the pandemonium. Our last and final stop was the Colaba Causeway\
  \ Market - a spot geared for tourists, with English speaking vendors and a superior\
  \ quality and selection of merchandise compared to the previous two markets. By\
  \ this point, however I was dehydrated and traumatized by my recent avian assault.\
  \ So, when they turned us loose at this market I bought\u2026a bunch of random crap!\
  \ I was flummoxed and temporarily robbed me of my ability to discern: I\u2019ll\
  \ take this groovy Indian shirt/dress, a bronze Ganesh, 3 Buddhas, this lovely Hindu\
  \ Saraswati, 4 Wooden Elephants, a pair of Balloon Pants, and an ESPIRIT shirt with\
  \ the tag cut out! \n\n\u201CHenna tattoo, Ma\u2019am?\u201D\n\u201C Sure why not.\u201D\
  \n\nNo matter! I returned to my hotel, elated by what I was able to take in a few\
  \ short hours, grateful for hot running water, and ready for whatever awaits in\
  \ the coming days!"
