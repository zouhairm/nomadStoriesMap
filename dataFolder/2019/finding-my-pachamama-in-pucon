Text: "My senses grew to life as the sun crept over the peaks and troughs of the Andean\
  \ escarpment. It was 6am. Our Cruz Del Sur overnight bus had toured us from Santiago\
  \ City, Chile, southbound through the picturesque Andean Lakes Region.\nMy forehead\
  \ rested on the frosty bus window. My breath fogged the glass. I could still taste\
  \ the sickly sweet Dulce De Leche Alfajores served for last night\u2019s dessert.\
  \ \nA lone street sign raced past my window: \n\u2018Beinvenidas a Pucon!\u2019\n\
  Pucon: A quaint town hidden in the Patagonia region of southern Chile, home to indigenous\
  \ inhabitants of the Andes, the Mapuche. \nPucon\u2019s\u2019s natural surroundings\
  \ had caught my eye, as I eagerly booked a seven-day tour of Chile. It was the first\
  \ week of my solo three-month travel adventure across South America. A young university\
  \ graduate, set to \u2018find\u2019 herself, or to \u2018at least give it a crack\u2019\
  .\nAs our overnight bus swung around the mountain-side, the silhouette of a grand,\
  \ stoic volcano painted itself into the backdrop of a quiet, undisturbed Andean\
  \ town. \nCurious, I turned to our Argentinean guide, Andre, stirring from his sleep\
  \ in the seat behind mine. Andre already knew the answer to my question: \u201C\
  Amiga! That is Volcan Villarrica!\u201D\n\u2018Villarrica\u2019 is a Mapuche word,\
  \ meaning \u2018House of Pilan\u2019, a revered spirit in Mapuche Mythology. Asserting\
  \ herself as one of Chile\u2019s most active volcanoes, Volcan Villarrica is one\
  \ of only five in the world known to have an active lava lake at its crater.\nAs\
  \ we reached the town of Pucon, I felt the warm hospitality of a ski town beckoning\
  \ us in. The wide-set stone streets were strewn with wooden apr\xE8s-ski lodges.\
  \ The town reminded me of winter holidays with my family, nestled in the Snowy Mountains\
  \ of New South Wales, Australia. \nPucon smelt like home.\nOur bus dropped us at\
  \ a partner tour agency in town, and, before I could say \u201CBueno\u201D, Andre\
  \ had booked our Volcan Villarrica climb for the following morning.\nAt 6am the\
  \ next day, we met the local guides in town. Rodrigues, Alejandro, and Miguel; three\
  \ striking Mapuche men, greeted us with appealing enthusiasm. They handed us crampons,\
  \ ice-picks, and a gas-mask for the peak.\n\u201CWhat is your name?\u201D Asked\
  \ Rodrigues, gesturing charismatically towards me, among the circle of tourists.\n\
  \u201CMi nombre Claire\u201D I replied\n\u201CBonita. Here in Chile, your name is\
  \ Clara!\u201D... \nI blushed.\nOur group of six spritely travellers jumped into\
  \ the rickety, grey Chevrolet truck, for our ride through the opulent Huerquehue\
  \ National Park, toward the foot of Volcan Villarrica. \nAs we started the hike,\
  \ we assumed our ant-trail formation to begin our ascent. I purposefully slid behind\
  \ Rodrigues. I was curious. I wanted to know more. \nThree hours into the hike,\
  \ Rodrigues turned to the panoramic view, and whispered to me: \u201CPachamama has\
  \ done great things here\u201D. \nRodrigues explained Pachamama as the \u2018Goddess\
  \ of Mother Nature\u2019; central to the belief system of indigenous tribes in the\
  \ Andes. The Mapuche people believe that Pachamama controls the balance between\
  \ humans and nature. By giving to Pachamama, she will give back.\nI had barely noticed\
  \ our five hour-long hike up the slippery volcanic rock crests and ice- laden slopes.\
  \ I was stolen by conversation with Rodrigues, traversing every topic under the\
  \ sun; from family and love, to Chilean politics, most notably the Pinochet regime\
  \ of the 1970\u2019s. \nWe could smell the summit before we could see it- the stench\
  \ of sulphur was intolerable. \nWere we on Mars?\nOnce adjusted to the gas-mask,\
  \ I took a moment to observe my surroundings; to take in the panoramic views that\
  \ only those who had climbed Villarrica deserved to see. \nTo the north, Villarrica\
  \ revealed some of her forty square kilometres of glacial ice peering out from the\
  \ spines of the Andes mountain range. To the south, she had painted fluorescent\
  \ blues and greens that weaved generously through the lush forests and tranquil\
  \ lakes.\nIn that moment, I understood; Pachamama has given the Mapuche people the\
  \ gift of Pucon. \nThey hadn\u2019t found Pachamama, but she had found them.\nRodrigues\
  \ saw my moment of clarity; \u201CClara, she gives us time here, and she gives us\
  \ home. That\u2019s why we must always look after her\u201D."
