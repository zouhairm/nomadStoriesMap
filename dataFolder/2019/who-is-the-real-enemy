Text: "Another volley and a few grenades with toxic agents fall to the ground. One\
  \ lands right next to me. Tears start to stream down my face. The gas is ripping\
  \ up my lungs and my coughing is impossible to stop. I\u2019m wading through the\
  \ furious crowd, trying to escape. Barricades, piles of broken glass and smoke from\
  \ the burning tires: Not exactly how I imagined my trip to Paris. \n\n   The police\
  \ are starting their offense against the protesters. I\u2019m trying to stay to\
  \ the side. Thank God I\u2019m not wearing a yellow jacket. They pass by me. Others\
  \ are less fortunate. Some are pushed down to the sidewalk, some are hit with batons.\n\
  \n   A few hours earlier, such a string of events was hard to imagine. It was another\
  \ beautiful morning in France. I woke up at my friend\u2019s apartment in Longjumeau,\
  \ a small town which is today considered as a suburb of Paris, but one hundred years\
  \ ago used to harbor comrade Lenin and other Russian revolutionaries.\n\n   I go\
  \ to the local bakery to buy my morning baguette and socialize. The weather is sunny\
  \ and the flavor of France is in the air. Normally it smells like croissants, freshly\
  \ brewed coffee and Dior perfume. Nevertheless, the public opinion is just like\
  \ a century ago. People talk about social injustices and the upcoming yellow jackets\u2019\
  \ demonstrations. \n\n   At the time I was an intern at the Russian Embassy. This\
  \ day I got an assignment in the city. I had to collect two credit card machines\
  \ from the shop downtown so that guests of tonight\u2019s embassy ball would have\
  \ a convenient way to pay for the extra drinks.\n\n   I have to call a taxi to get\
  \ to the shop. Half of the city streets are blocked; we are stuck in a traffic jam.\
  \ Not only is the radio talking about these protests, so is the driver and every\
  \ person that I encounter. Meanwhile, I get a chance to see everything with my own\
  \ two eyes through the taxi window. The yellow jackets are marching on the Champs\
  \ Elysees, waving their banners, French flags and singing La Marseillaise. \n\n\
  \   We can\u2019t move further as the road is blocked. I get out of the taxi and\
  \ am forced to walk the rest of my itinerary. Out here on the streets, everything\
  \ happens. The French riot police are on offense, forcing the protesters to retreat.\
  \ Some lay unmoving on the ground, some are running away. I help one young man who\
  \ is about my age to stand up. He swears, accusing the police officers. Then, he\
  \ declares the police to be the \u201Cenemy of the people\u201D. As a Russian, I\
  \ can\u2019t help but explain to him the origin of the word. We talk about politics\
  \ and about history. My new friend expresses his communist beliefs. I share my views\
  \ on how communism hasn\u2019t worked out that well in my country. Then, we both\
  \ agree that socialism like in Scandinavian countries might be a good idea. \n\n\
  \   It\u2019s getting dark by the time I reach my destination. I enter the shop,\
  \ cover the check, collect the machines, and hail another taxi to get to the ball.\
  \ Just a couple blocks away from the diplomatic site, I have to leave the taxi again.\
  \ To pass the barricades, everyone has to go through the same security check point\
  \ as I do. The Presidential Palace is located on the street just past it. Dressed\
  \ in a tuxedo, I show my Russian passport.\n\n\u201CDo you work here?\u201D, the\
  \ policeman asks. \n\n\u201COui, monsieur\u201D.\n\n   When I finally arrive to\
  \ the ball, I don\u2019t feel like making friends with these people anymore. The\
  \ whole luxury of this aristocratic party seems excessive and vulgar to me. How\
  \ can they be feasting in times of plague? Here, the nobles are also talking about\
  \ the yellow jackets, but mostly in derogatory terms. After having paid for an invitation\
  \ that costs just as much as the average monthly wage of a French worker.\n\n\u201C\
  If they want to live a good life, these people have to work hard instead of merely\
  \ strolling the streets\u201D, the nobles say."
