Text: "By the fourth playing of the Kenyan version of \u201CJesus is Marvelous\u201D\
  , I knew I was in for a memorable road trip.  My driver and colleague, Wilson had\
  \ offered to drive me to Naivasha, about an hour and a half outside of Nairobi where\
  \ we both lived.  Wilson was a Security Coordinator and I don\u2019t know if it\
  \ was his title or his contagious spirit, but talk to anyone and they will tell\
  \ you that just being near him makes a person feel safe.\n\n\u201CKwa!\u201D, yells\
  \ Wilson as we speed steadily down the steep escarpment that carves into the Great\
  \ Rift Valley.  As a student of Swahili, Wilson likes to keep me on my toes.  His\
  \ favorite phrase to shout at mzungus, or foreigners, is \u2018kwa\u2019, literally\
  \ translating to just about any preposition you choose.  The meaning doesn\u2019\
  t matter as much as the decibel in which it is voiced.  \u201CKwa\u201D had become\
  \ somewhat of a greeting between us, confusing most Swahili speakers within hearing\
  \ distance.\n\nOne time, Wilson and I visited a refugee camp in Tanzania to oversee\
  \ the building of some classrooms and a satellite office for our resettlement organization.\
  \  I loved traveling with Wilson.  Tasks that, from the outside, seemed daunting\
  \ or dull suddenly overflowed with side-aching and cheek-hurting laughter. It was\
  \ the dry season and the strong winds easily swept up the dehydrated red earth and\
  \ sent it swirling around everything in its path. Our seasoned Tanzanian driver\
  \ could barely see the road in front of us.  \u201CTake my picture KWA this dust!\u201D\
  \ Wilson shouted.  The driver and I looked at each other.  Did he mean \u201Cin\u201D\
  \ the dust?  Into the dust?  By the dust? For, on, or under the dust?  We didn\u2019\
  t have too much time to think about it before Wilson was out of the car, hands in\
  \ the air, spinning through the dust storm, looking as free as the wind itself.\n\
  \nThis time, Wilson\u2019s, \u201Ckwa!\u201D meant \u201Clook at those baboons BY\
  \ the road!\u201D  Nearly every drive down the escarpment affords opportunities\
  \ to see baboons closer than you may want to.  Five baboons sat together, sharing\
  \ food scraps and grooming each other incessantly, dangerously close to both the\
  \ speeding cars and the steep drop off below. The mother baboon\u2019s gaze caught\
  \ mine.  As we stared into each other\u2019s mzungu eyes, we both rocked side to\
  \ side in time to the infectious rhythm of \u201COh, it is wonderful! It is marvelous\
  \ and wonderful.\u201D\n\nFor the rest of the drive, I kept the window down, my\
  \ hair flowing in the breeze that smelled of grilled corn and wood fires. I felt\
  \ KWA Kenya. This country - the people, the animals, the air, the laughter, the\
  \ history - was in, on, under, by, and through me.  Life was marvelous.  And just\
  \ like my friend, Wilson, I felt like shouting it."
