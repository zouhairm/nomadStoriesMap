Text: "I have never lived in a van before.  I have foggy memories of family motorhome\
  \ trips in Texas when I was three years old.  My oldest brother insisting on starting\
  \ the fire, my Mom cooking simple meals on the stove top, and my Dad behind the\
  \ wheel with a thick mustache and very short shorts, but it was the 80\u2019s after\
  \ all.\n\nMy husband and I, however, quickly embraced camping as a favorite pastime\
  \ of ours while living in California.  One of our very first excursions together\
  \ was to Joshua Tree in June, nearly 10 years ago.  We drove with the Jeep top down\
  \ in the dry, desert heat, as we observed the thermometer rise from 85 to 105 in\
  \ a matter of hours.  Our hair blown, our lips dry, and our spirits rejuvenated,\
  \ we explored the ancient rock formations, while drinking cold beer and watching\
  \ the slow and steady sunset.  It was pretty magical, and I think that experience\
  \ solidified our thirst for nature and adventure and skies and campfire, all while\
  \ discovering everything California could offer.\n\nA few years later, we were stalked\
  \ by a giant bear in Big Bear.  I would say that\u2019s a fitting name, don\u2019\
  t you think?  Another time, we got caught in a torrential rain storm in the desert\
  \ and due to the fear of flash flooding, we slept in our cramped car for the entire\
  \ night.  We have camped under giant Sequoias and swam in a cold swimming hole naturally\
  \ carved in rock formations within the great Sierra mountains.  We returned back\
  \ to Joshua Tree many times, but our last camping trip really took it out of us.\
  \  The campsites were entirely full upon arrival, so we ended up sleeping in a dusty,\
  \ dry, dirty parking lot, with the relentless heat beating down on us like a sting\
  \ you can\u2019t relieve, and it was awful.  After that experience, camping was\
  \ not as desirable to us as much.\n\nNow, we are here in New Zealand, a beautiful,\
  \ clean, vast, and extraordinary land.  We are living out of a camper van and there\
  \ is a child-like joy I\u2019m beginning to discover all over again.  I don\u2019\
  t get regular showers, I don't have a mirror, I don\u2019t have AC, WiFi, or even\
  \ a proper mattress to sleep on, but you know what?  It is bloody amazing at times.\
  \  I\u2019m literally living in something that can turn on at any given moment,\
  \ hit the road and see new sights every single day.  We slept in a sleepy beach\
  \ town our first two nights, next to a sulfuric lake the next night, and by the\
  \ most picturesque, ocean-size lake last night.  We awoke this morning, with the\
  \ heartbeat of waves booming down on the lakeshore, packed up our camper van and\
  \ hit the road \u2014 passing by forests as giant as they are in fairytales, volcanoes,\
  \ hundreds of sheep, and geysers.  If this isn\u2019t freedom and adventure, I don\u2019\
  t know what is.\n\nWe may be a bit dirty, fighting off viruses, and exhausted from\
  \ being sick, but I have not slept more soundly in a long time and there\u2019s\
  \ a quiet peace and contentment that\u2019s starting to wash over me.\n\nI feel\
  \ as though I have already seen so much of this wild country having spent hours\
  \ on the road, through twists and turns, up mountains and then back down, across\
  \ gravel and paved, with a handful of bumps along the way.  Tonight, we have set\
  \ up camp beside a glacial lake, hugged by towering mountains.  I am standing outside\
  \ of the van, and the wind whips through, but somehow I still feel warm.  I tilt\
  \ my head back to peer up at the night sky, and it is the brightest I have ever\
  \ seen \u2014 stars so splashed around, it\u2019s like there are a million, glistening\
  \ holes in the sky.  I don\u2019t think I have ever seen a sky so alive\u2026\n\n\
  I don\u2019t think I have ever been so alive."
