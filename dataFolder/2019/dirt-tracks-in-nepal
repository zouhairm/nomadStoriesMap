Text: "The shout was unexpected: \u201CWhy are you doing this?\u201D\n\nThe pain in\
  \ my lower back had begun around the third or fourth ascent. The narrow, mud-dried\
  \ path cut vertically up through once wild hills now set aside for vegetables, or\
  \ baari, as they\u2019re called in Nepali. It was my first time using a doko, the\
  \ traditional, conical bamboo-weaved baskets that perch on the forehead but pull\
  \ on the neck and lower back. I was drawing attention from the neighbours.\n\nI\
  \ had been living in Kathmandu for 2 months with my British-Nepali partner, Laxmi,\
  \ whose family grew up in these hills in the district of Sindhupalchok, a two-hour\
  \ drive northeast of the capital. Laxmi\u2019s uncle, Ram, was 75, and lived with\
  \ his wife, Savitri, in the village of Teenghare. Their four children now lived\
  \ in Kathmandu or abroad. As with many villages in Nepal, it was the elderly who\
  \ had been left behind and who now dotted the green terraces. Once carefully cultivated\
  \ paddies, now left unfarmed due to a shortage of farmhands, had begun to recede\
  \ back into the grasses, or made way for welcomed dirt roads, a rudimentary network\
  \ of connection and interconnection across the sides of steep valleys. \n\nHelping\
  \ Ram and Savitri carry some wood\u2014which I was shown how to pack and balance\
  \ like a Jenga puzzle in my doko by Ram\u2019s youngest daughter, Srijana, who had\
  \ travelled with us from Kathmandu\u2014felt like the least I could do. But in doing\
  \ so, I was unexpectedly stepping outside my circumscribed role as ostensible son-in-law\u2014\
  a view the local men were quick to voice. \n\nAnother shout: \u201CIt would be better\
  \ if didi carried it!\u201D \n\nIn Nepal, the heavy lifting tends to be done by\
  \ the women. These were not the main trekking routes where male porters carry obscene\
  \ loads up and down mountains. These were the smaller, unseen paths cutting across\
  \ the foothills where women carry daily loads of wood, grass feed, bedding for livestock\
  \ up and down, back and forth between the hills and their homes. These routes were\
  \ not for tourism, but for Nepal\u2019s principal economic activity: agriculture.\n\
  \nThe good work I believed I was contributing was being undone by the unexpected\
  \ cultural transgression\u2014a fact confirmed by the gentle yet somewhat pained\
  \ expression that met me at the hilltop. \n\n\u201CPlease, sit\u201D Ram insisted,\
  \ in a hurry to bring the ordeal to an end. He pulled a small stool from the doorway\
  \ of his one-room hut that had, until recently, provided shelter for him and Savitri\
  \ since the earthquake in 2015.\n\nIt was a bric-a-brac affair; a simple wooden\
  \ frame against which tin sheeting, slate and branches had been propped, all covered\
  \ with multicoloured tarpaulin. Ram and Savitri had pieced it together themselves,\
  \ their meek attempt at defence. Just two months earlier, a clouded leopard had\
  \ clawed its way in, metres from where Ram and Savitri slept, and made off with\
  \ a valuable kid goat. The experience had left its mark in Savitri\u2019s constant\
  \ patching and layering of materials, to do whatever she could to bolster the humble\
  \ structure. The hut contained three small dung-mud stoves built into the floor\
  \ and one bed tucked up on the left-hand wall. A prized cow occupied the right-hand\
  \ side in an area separated with a wooden beam. Cooking utensils, aluminium water\
  \ jugs and wood were neatly piled on the floor, and plastic bags full of rice and\
  \ flour and spices hung from beams out of the reach of mice that skirted the room\u2019\
  s periphery, though they were thought to bring good luck.\n\n\u201CLeave the doko\
  \ here\u2026 sit down. Tomorrow I will introduce you to the village\u201D, said\
  \ Ram. \n\nRam had received only the first instalment of his earthquake reparation\
  \ money, and had built the bare-bone structure of a new utilitarian two-room house\
  \ where 5 of us would share a bedroom for the next 3 days. Later that night, as\
  \ I lay in bed, amidst what I thought were growls, I dared myself to make a dash\
  \ to the newly built toilet cubicle which was as yet doorless and lay directly opposite\
  \ a new shelter which housed 3 goats. \n\nUnable to read the landscape, I thought\
  \ better of it."
