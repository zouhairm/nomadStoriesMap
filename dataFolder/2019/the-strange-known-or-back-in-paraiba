Text: "Prologue \n\nWhen I was 15, I had a very hard fight with my father, due to\
  \ that I had to leave my little city in Para\xEDba, a province in the north of Brazilian\
  \ backwoods. For long years I didn\u2019t come back, I can\u2019t just forget what\
  \ happened. Time passed, I solve my problems with my father and finally, I diced\
  \ to visit my parents.  I take 4 hours on an airplane, others 2 in a car trip and\
  \ finally 2 with my father in his van. That\u2019s when my story starts. \n\nThe\
  \ Arrival \n\nOn the airplane I look at the window, I wish would arrive as soon\
  \ as possible. While I listen to the songs of Gilberto Gil and Caetano Veloso. Particular\
  \ music is in my mind, \u201CBack In Bahia\u201D that\u2019s about missing home\
  \ and try to stay strong while you\u2019re so far from there. The airplane land\
  \ and I got hit by the hot breeze, 20 degrees hotter than S\xE3o Paulo, where I\
  \ live.  Then I thought \u201CI\u2019m at home\u201D, even knowing that I\u2019\
  m still 400 kilometers away from my mother\u2019s house. That means 2 hours by car\
  \ and more 2 on a van.  \n\nThe meddle \n\nOnce in the car, I see the rivers that\
  \ knew so well. They are almost dry; the ground announces the drought times had\
  \ begun.  My heart is full of sadness and guilt, \u201Cwhy I didn\u2019t stay here\
  \ and help my mother? What else I\u2019ll find?\u201D. I arrive at Campina Grande,\
  \ in the middle of the way, I finally met my father. That is another impact, he\
  \ is old, I couldn't imagine in all my life that my father could be so aged. I realize\
  \ time has been passing to him too. Something is in the air, a very strange one,\
  \ the streets seem dirty. All this is like a dream that seems real, but a little\
  \ bit wrong pictured.  \n\nEvery star is a bonfire. \n\nAfter all, I\u2019m in my\
  \ city, Prata. From the car\u2019s window, I watch known people passing. It\u2019\
  s like to look throw an aquarium glass, the stranger known.  Everything is as I\
  \ can remember, houses full of colors, full star\u2019s sky. Scorpion's constellations\
  \ over my head, as used to be. Stars burn their blue fire over us, like bonfires\
  \ spilling they light. I\u2019m happy that I can barely recognize my world. It hadn't\
  \ changed totally, yet.  \n\nIt\u2019s S\xE3o Jo\xE3o party, a typical one that\
  \ celebrates the harvest and the life of three saints of Catholic Church (St Paul,\
  \ St. John and St. Joseph). We celebrate and make bonfires. That\u2019s the biggest\
  \ traditional party of north and northwest of Brazil. The party is full of means.\
  \ The entire city becomes red and bright, the bonfire\u2019s light dance in the\
  \ walls and some sparks flight into the air. They seem like little stars crossing\
  \ the sky\u2019s darkness. I'm fell living in a tale, everyone is happy and proud,\
  \ every night my friend Natalia makes us a bonfire. \n\nDurst Glasses \n\nSomething\
  \ had just changed on me, I don\u2019t know what or why those things aren\u2019\
  t the same as it was in my childhood. Is impossible don\u2019t realize the problems\
  \ of that society lifestyle, the machismo that makes everything a little bitter.\
  \ Then I realized that despite the fact I was born there, I can't feel fully connect\
  \ anymore. Everything has a little dust.  \n\nSert\xE3o (backwoods); a river. \n\
  \nMy vacation\u2019s days end, I\u2019m crazy to go back to S\xE3o Paulo. My airplane\
  \ takeoff. I go back, in my mind, to the moment that I across the city gate. That\
  \ also takes me to Grande Sert\xE3o Veredas, my favorite book. In the book, the\
  \ main character across S\xE3o Francisco\u2019s river and it breaks his lives in\
  \ two parts, what passed and what will be. That represents a very hard change, he\
  \ wasn't the same anymore, it\u2019s a transition. That whole vacation was my S\xE3\
  o Francisco crossing, that splits my life. After that Vacation, I start to make\
  \ my degree (now I\u2019m a teacher). I also start therapy, that was very important\
  \ to understand all the emotion that the trip brought to me."
