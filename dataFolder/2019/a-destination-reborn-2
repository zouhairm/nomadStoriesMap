Text: "Like the spine of a sleeping dragon, dramatic limestone mountains rise above\
  \ the luscious paddy fields of central Laos.\n\nIn the middle of it all, you'll\
  \ find Vang Vieng.\n\nA serene town set against a backdrop of limestone karst, shrouded\
  \ in mist and rain, cutting through the countryside of Laos the Nam Song river flows\
  \ through Vang Vieng offering one of Asia\u2019s most picturesque locations for\
  \ adventure.\n\nOnce a small agricultural community, it became a hedonistic jungle\
  \ town after it was \u201Cdiscovered\u201D by western backpackers. Over the years\
  \ the secret got out, and Vang Vieng became a symbol of everything wrong with backpacking.\
  \ A town heaving with bars and clubs catering to tourists who came to get as shitfaced\
  \ as possible and do drugs flouted local customs and treated this place as their\
  \ playground. The surrounding landscape and its activities were ignored in favor\
  \ of the river, which became lined with bars selling drugs, cheap drinks, and fun\
  \ times.\n\nBut after the government cracked down on the river party culture in\
  \ 2012, I found a very different place when I came in 2015. All around me were signs\
  \ of a previous era: zip lines and rope swings sitting unused, bars long ago boarded\
  \ up, and fading signs advertising cheap drinks. Vang Vieng\u2019s riverbank was\
  \ a reminder of the town\u2019s recent past, like a modern Gomorrah.\n\nNow there\
  \ was barely a peep coming from the surrounding area, no blaring music, no backpackers\
  \ are jumping into a too-shallow river. Just a few kayakers, tubers, and friends\
  \ are enjoying the day\u2019s final warmth from the sun.\n\nAs I went further out\
  \ of town, away from the backpackers, and guided Chinese and Korean tours. I discovered\
  \ that the people who lived in the rural mountain villages outside of Vang Vieng.\
  \ Shops, markets, and various Buddhist temples give way to dusty roads that lead\
  \ me to ethnic minority villages hidden away in the valleys of the mountains. There\
  \ other volunteers and I helped with the building of a school in the village, so\
  \ the children didn\u2019t have to walk kilometers to the next closest school. \n\
  \nWhen it was time for a local festival, the locals were more than happy to welcome\
  \ me into their homes, this led to a day of drinking beer and celebrations as me,\
  \ and the other volunteers moved on from house to house taking in both the smiles\
  \ and hospitality of the locals.\n\nWhen I first came to Laos, I didn\u2019t know\
  \ what I\u2019d find in Vang Vieng. Was I to find a cultural crossroads or a den\
  \ of debauchery? What I did find, was a people who have adapted to both the demands\
  \ of tourists as well as the government to use the blue lagoons, hidden caves, towering\
  \ cliffs, and picturesque landscape to their advantage. \n\nSo Instead of a haven\
  \ of immorality. I had found an eco-haven who reinvented its identity to both preserve\
  \ and cash in on its natural beauty."
