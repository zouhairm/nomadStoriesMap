Text: "Cobblestone winding along the dusty landscape with the brilliant blue backdrop\
  \ of the Mediterranean Sea. I walked and breathed in the sea air and tried not to\
  \ get too lost in the beautiful buildings surrounding me, but failed nonetheless.\
  \ My cousin, who was serving as my tour guide rambled on ahead about something.\
  \ I paid little attention however as I was focussed on not tripping along my path,\
  \ my legs far too used to the flat prairies of Manitoba.\n\n Eventually she led\
  \ me up a path that took us far past the tiny houses and plastered walls of Santorini\
  \ and onto a large, public terrace. Flowers blooming and greenery everywhere, I\
  \ hardly noticed the huge wall behind us until she remarked that she had never seen\
  \ this place either. I turned around and immediately was struck by the looming,\
  \ ancient slab that stood between us and something unknown. I knew I needed to see\
  \ what was behind it. \n\nConvincing her to climb over the wall was a struggle,\
  \ and getting over it was another battle. Once we finally made it, it was haunting.\
  \ Unsettlingly quiet and devoid of even the smallest insects, we took it in. It\
  \ appeared  to be an abandoned village, cavernous buildings tarnished by the elements\
  \ and windows blown out by countless storms. Wrecked furniture and knick-knacks\
  \ lay strewn about with other odds and ends littering the ground. Peeking into the\
  \ nearest husk I was able to make out a staircase to nowhere, accompanied by what\
  \ looked like a rusty barrel. I wanted to go further in and explore but it felt\
  \ almost wrong to disturb what felt like an ancient grave site. It was a bit like\
  \ looking at some ancient skeleton - you knew it belonged to someone at some point,\
  \ but now it was simply a bleached shell, forgotten and abandoned behind an innocent\
  \ wall curled with ivy and beautiful pink flowers. \n\nSantorini is a small touristy\
  \ town, cheerfully painted in bright whites and blues, with the sea encircling it.\
  \ But even the locals have places to explore and new haunts to find. You just have\
  \ to look and see and let fate draw you towards new adventures."
