Text: "Throughout life, we are faced with various situations that sometimes are beneficial\
  \ to our lives and on the other, bring great lessons that we never forget. When\
  \ I set out to bring the title of the story: Just walk to meet an elephant; there\
  \ occurred in my mind a retrospective of almost everything I have experienced throughout\
  \ my life, from which I began to walk through the country. In the present history,\
  \ I bring aspects related to culture (traditional authorities, music, dance and\
  \ circumcision, hunting), gender relations, economy and youth.\nAngola is a multicultural\
  \ country with more than 10 national languages, namely Umbundu, Kimbundu, Kikongo,\
  \ Fiote, Nganguela, Nhaneka, Cokwe, Ngoya, Hungo, Kwanyama, and others derived from\
  \ these languages \u200B\u200Bjust mentioned. For ten years, I have been around\
  \ the country, where I had the opportunity to experience a lot that currently makes\
  \ me feel grateful for the opportunity and knowledge of the various matters on Angola\
  \ As I have presented the legend of this history, traditional authorities play a\
  \ very important role in the Angolan culture, they present themselves as local authority,\
  \ either by coercion in case of illicit behavior as well as problem solving, where\
  \ EKanga ( traditional judgment) where the problems are solved and sentenced the\
  \ defendants, without the intervention of the police. In this Ekanga, when someone\
  \ is found guilty in a particular crime (infidelity, robbery, witchcraft), he is\
  \ put on a hard punishment, pressing the middle part of the ears and the skull with\
  \ two trunks called Olomwango and rubbing gray on his face, this happens in almost\
  \ every provinces. In others to prove the innocence of someone who is denying a\
  \ case, this is taken in an Ombala (Palace of Sobas) sitting in a chair and if guilty\
  \ dies. As for the traditional authorities, the majority have two to three women.\
  \ In the province of Cuanza Norte, municipality of Bolongongo, I met a river where\
  \ there is no fishing, in case someone tries, as soon as they eat the same fish\
  \ is able to die, followed by some relatives, depending on the amount of fish caught.\
  \ For this, only Soba can authorize fishing.\nThe music is characterized by songs\
  \ and some musical instruments like batuque and rattle tied about to the legs, accompanied\
  \ by palms and dances like: Olundongo, Tchianda, most of the times. Circumcision\
  \ is an annual practice which involves young teenagers in the sense of these pass\
  \ to life flatters, this occurs in the months of June to July each year and the\
  \ same process is called Evamba, Etanda and Mukanda. And this is done in cold blood,\
  \ without anesthesia and artificial medicines, the cure is natural \"I personally\
  \ am one of these young people\". This practice is associated with hunting, where\
  \ each one of the circumcised ones has the obligation to always catch an animal\
  \ to offer to his Naw\xE3 (person who is in charge of accompanying the treatment\
  \ of the circumcised. also has very traditional cultural aspects, such as the house\
  \ Etambo where the hunter spirits of the hunter rest, this is much more seen in\
  \ the province of Huambo and Bi\xE9.\nIn the provinces where I passed, women are\
  \ even submissive to their husbands, women do almost everything at home (take care\
  \ of the family, confection of food, etc.), in gender relations, man is always the\
  \ head of the family, taking into account the local culture. In one of the municipalities\
  \ of Huambo province, one of the women interviewed said in the umbundu language:\
  \ \"Alume kacitava okuti vakava enene, sanga olo\xF1ga\xF1ga vimbo vitepuluka\"\
  \ (that is to say in Portuguese, men should not get too tired because babies may\
  \ decrease in the village).\nThe economy of the rural population is very much based\
  \ on family agriculture and small and large animal husbandry. But in these the woman\
  \ has much more power in corn, chickens, goats, and perhaps pigs, while the ox is\
  \ only the husband who rules.\nIn rural areas, polygamy is a normal case, a man\
  \ can have more than three wives and they live together without problems, even in\
  \ some places, such as Cuanza Norte, Namibe, Cunene and U\xEDge, a husband, can\
  \ live with more than three wives in the same house and sleeping in different rooms\
  \ by daily or weekly scale."
