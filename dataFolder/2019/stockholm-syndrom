Text: "I couldn\u2019t clearly understand how victims feel something towards their\
  \ captors until I myself became a captive. Stockholm captured me by its beauty and\
  \ unique colorfulness, mixed with simplicity and elegance. I won\u2019t deny it\
  \ \u2013 I fell in love with this city in a matter of only a few hours. Its narrow\
  \ streets, laid with pavement, on which you will certainly stumble in some places;\
  \ its colorful houses that surround you from all sides, and, God forbid, you miss\
  \ at least one; the themed shops and restaurants, where you want to spend all your\
  \ money without even thinking. It is simply astounding how easily you lose your\
  \ mind there, be it from its beauty or the beer you drank. However, every love story\
  \ has its own brief foreword and I would be an egoist if I didn\u2019t tell it.\
  \ \n\nBefore falling in love with the perfection of Stockholm, I almost died on\
  \ the ship.  A great start to a beautiful story, right? I started my trip from Riga\
  \ by ferryboat, dreaming about chilly wind, sea breeze, and a couple of cocktails\
  \ to sleep better. However, as always, my dreams did not exactly correspond to reality.\
  \ The waves at open sea reached five-six meters in height, I was swung not just\
  \ from side to side, but in a circle, not to mention the terrible vibrations that\
  \ I felt when the ferry cut through the waves. I accidentally remembered the \u201C\
  Titanic\u201D, after which I became even sadder because Leonardo DiCaprio was not\
  \ by my side, in his place was only my best friend. The next morning, I woke up\
  \ green like seaweed in the sea, feeling a terrible headache and still without Leo.\
  \ Nevertheless, this did not prevent me from quickly whipping myself into shape\
  \ and going ashore into my captivity. Getting off the ferry, we found ourselves\
  \ in a fairly simple residential area, where I tried (in vain attempts) to find\
  \ the very multi-colored houses and famous pavement I was promised. A couple of\
  \ metro stations later, I already fell in love with the style of clothes of the\
  \ Swedes and their Scandinavian appearance, and I found myself in the very center\
  \ of beauty.\n\nIt seemed that that place could not get any more beautiful. I was\
  \ surrounded by flawless small houses, various attractive signs of cafes, and the\
  \ aroma of freshly baked goods hovers, it seemed that this city knows no boundaries.\
  \ The snow has started to fall, forcing me to look at the architecture of the city\
  \ through the prism of fluffy snowflakes. All that was missing wonderful music to\
  \ feel like a fairy tale. Having a quick dinner and saluting to Swedish beer, my\
  \ friends and I set off to travel through the old town, slowly moving towards the\
  \ modern part.  There we had the luck to notice a huge iced circle without any fences,\
  \ in the middle of which stood a monument, with small light bulbs diverging from\
  \ it in different directions, creating something akin to a dome of pure light. One\
  \ could safely step on the rink in shoes. Remembering our carefree playful childhood,\
  \ we all rushed there, not afraid to fall or to seem like complete idiots.\nHaving\
  \ had enough of rolling and falling, we dived into the modern part of the city,\
  \ which blew me off my feet. Shopping centers, it seemed to me, merged into one\
  \ another, even being in different buildings. When you go into one and go down,\
  \ you find yourself in an underground passage, where there are various shops, and\
  \ among them, there is an entry to the subway, an exit to the square, and ... the\
  \ next shopping center. In the midst of this entire maze, people are in a hurry\
  \ to be somewhere, not losing themselves in the exits and crowds of tourists.\n\n\
  I was only a day in this city, capturing its entire atmosphere only superficially,\
  \ but I already fell in love with it so much that I'm still thinking about the next\
  \ time I could visit it. This story is without thieves, without sudden meetings\
  \ with famous people or funny embarrassments. This is the story of a novice traveler,\
  \ who suffered from the Stockholm syndrome."
