Text: "I have made myself a promise to visit a different place at least once a year.\
  \ This time, my husband and I decided to visit ''Little Greece\", better known as\
  \ Club Mykonos in Langebaan on our west coast. It is best described as our own Greek\
  \ styled village with modern twists like the casino for patrons who like to take\
  \ the chance of winning some money and a spa offering luxurious treatments to those\
  \ who would just like to release the stress from the city.\n\nAs Club Mykonos is\
  \ a self-catering accommodation, we went to get some things to cook for breakfast\
  \ at the Laguna Mall where you can buy everything you need. It also has a beautiful\
  \ shop with local curios associated with Langebaan such as mugs painted with dolphins\
  \ or star fish shaped plates.\n\nOne afternoon we decided to go try the local cuisine\
  \ at Die Strandloper restaurant which is synomous with it's famous seafood dishes.\
  \ All the courses are cooked on an open fire. You can enjoy the grilled line fish\
  \ or crayfish with lemon butter or the smoked mussels. They are all scrumptious\
  \ and you will savour every bite. The atmosphere is open and friendly which encourages\
  \ locals and tourists to mingle.\n\nOn day three of our trip we decided to take\
  \ a drive to the town of Paternoster which is a little fishing village north of\
  \ our stay. There we met some local fishermen who sold us some crayfish at discounted\
  \ prices. As crayfish is expensive in Cape Town the was something I didn't expect\
  \ to find and we made a local connection as well. These fishermen are very humble,\
  \ hard working and are definitely knowledgeable about the sea. You can see how easily\
  \ they skipper their boats and pull the nets with their fresh catches. We had a\
  \ great time talking to them about the history of the town and how much they enjoy\
  \ living there.\n\nWe decided to take an hour long boat cruise on the lagoon where\
  \ one can enjoy the tour of Club Mykonos via the water by having some bubbly and\
  \ snacks. One will learn of the local celebrities who have homes in the area and\
  \ also about the local wildlife. Tourists can also enjoy yacht trips out of the\
  \ bay if that tickles their fancy.\n\nBy walking alongside the lagoon, you can see\
  \ the local birds such as the African Oyster Catcher (they are now an endangered\
  \ species)  if you enjoy bird watching and find many more by trekking along the\
  \ shore. \n\nThe shoreline at the beach which is just metres from your accommodation\
  \ in Langebaan is also great for watching the beautiful orange sunsets - with your\
  \ partner or alone it is quite a sight to behold. Birds will be flying above your\
  \ head to their nests for the evening. You can enjoy a picnic on the beach with\
  \ your partner in the amazing ocean atmosphere surrounding you.\n\nFor breakfast\
  \ the next day we had bacon and scrambled eggs with sausage, grilled tomato and\
  \ mushrooms which we made in the beautifully renovated kitchen. We enjoyed this\
  \ on the balcony overlooking the ocean and the harbour with the yachts moored, beautifully\
  \ floating like a moving painting.\n\nFor lunch we decided to have chicken which\
  \ we grilled in the oven with some salad all bought from PicknPay at Laguna Mall.\
  \ That we had beside the pool just before having a leisurely swim. I enjoyed a lovely\
  \ bubble bath and my husband had a cool shower after which we just relaxed in the\
  \ breezy living room, watching the bouquet of channels on the television.\n\nThe\
  \ television also runs the adverts on where to find good local cuisine and entertainment\
  \ in and around Club Mykonos. At the time we were there Heinz Winckler, a local\
  \ artist, performed at the harbour amphitheatre in the evening. It was a fun time\
  \ and we also made new friends and local connections for business at the event.\n\
  \nThe entire experience of visiting the West Coast was unexpected in so many different\
  \ wonderful surprises which I will remember always. I will definitely return to\
  \ explore the rest of the towns on this friendly, peaceful and vibrant coast."
