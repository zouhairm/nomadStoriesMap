Text: "If I think in that phrase, I move to four years ago in a plane looking at the\
  \ country painted green. I, with my degree just printed, a book and a luggage arrived\
  \ to Ireland to know the culture which I had studied so much about. I was ready\
  \ to test all my years of study and to embark on a life far from my loyal protectors;\
  \ my parents.\n\nFinally, I arrived at night...late, very late. I arrived to a house\
  \ in an unknown neighbourhood and, in spite of the time, there was a woman waiting\
  \ for me with a cup of tea and a bar of chocolate. Having my heart beating hard,\
  \ I got into Marion's house...\n\n- This is your room, this is the bathroom and\
  \ here you have the wifi's password....Do you like peanut butter?\n\nI was there,\
  \ holding a piece of paper with passwords, standing in front of smilling woman asking\
  \ me what I liked eating. I was in the country of my dreams... If I hadn't eaten\
  \ during all my stay, it would have been fine by me.\n \nIt was day again, I woke\
  \ up in the bed that would be mine for the following six months, I took my cellphone,\
  \ I read messages from my supportive brother, my friends and one dissapointing message\
  \ from someone that I left in my home country. I abandoned my cellphone, had a shower\
  \ and went back to my dream come true.\n\nAfter breakfast, I took my books and went\
  \ to my new university. I got out home and I saw a shining sun, something very unusual\
  \ in Ireland....the country was welcoming me.\n\nDuring my days in Galway, I talked\
  \ about Literature, wrote essays, presented a project in my bussiness class, visited\
  \ cliffs, travelled by bike, drank beer listening a Celt band, met new people, made\
  \ friends and walked under the rain with a wide smile.\n\nThose days taught me to\
  \ be alone without feeling lonely, broke cultural boundaries, discovered that all\
  \ of what I had learnt had had huge results and that it only depended on me keep\
  \ growing. I learnt to get rid of all the weight that deprived me of walking light.\
  \ I learnt that life is what I make of it.\n\nI came back home leaving one part\
  \ of me in Galway and bringing one part of the city with me. Some day I will go\
  \ back to that city where I fell in love with life....that place that made me understand\
  \ that I have to love my life no matter where I am."
