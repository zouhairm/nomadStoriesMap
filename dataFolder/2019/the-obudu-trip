Text: "My leap into the unknown occurred in 2013 during my final year at the University\
  \ as an undergraduate. There was this course titled tourism which involved travelling\
  \ to a particular destination as the practical aspect of the course. On this faithful\
  \ morning, my colleagues and I were in the university compound as early as 5am in\
  \ preparation for the great journey ahead. Our chosen destination was Obudu Cattle\
  \ Ranch Calabar Cross River State. At 7am,the commercial buses that would convey\
  \ us to our destination arrived the school compound and we began to load our luggage\
  \ into the buses which totalled eighteen in number. We did not leave the University\
  \ compound until 8am because of the necessary exit papers we needed to get before\
  \ leaving the university premises. As the journey began, I was filled with enthusiasm\
  \ as our destination was the southern part of the country, \xE0 region i had never\
  \ been to before. Our vehicles stopped severally on the way to enable us buy edibles\
  \ and ease ourselves. At about 7pm we entered a local market at top speed and one\
  \ of the buses nearly knocked down a hawker, we were only saved by providence as\
  \ we were later told that an event like that could result in the vehicle being set\
  \ ablaze. We arrived our destination in the middle of the night due to the slow\
  \ speed of the vehicles. One frightening event that occurred on the road was when\
  \ the bus I was in had a fault at about 1am some miles to a small village. Everywhere\
  \ was dark and my bus was the last bus on the road, every other bus had left us\
  \ behind. The driver said the fan belt of the bus was bad and he had to change it\
  \ right there. My colleagues and I started a little protest against the driver but\
  \ he warned us not to make any noise as the villagers might wake up and think they\
  \ were about to be attacked by armed robbers, unfortunately for us, the village\
  \ was an agrarian community, we did not understand their language and they did not\
  \ also understand ours. We remained calm and quickly helped the driver to fix the\
  \ damaged fan belt. Soon we were on our way, and we arrived our hotel in Calabar\
  \ at exactly 2am in the morning. My bus was the last bus that arrived the hotel,\
  \ my friends and I couldn't get a room, we had to sleep at the gymnasium till morning.\
  \ In the morning, I went out with my friends to have a view of the city of Calabar.\
  \ We had breakfast and went back to our hotel. In the evening, we strolled out to\
  \ have a traditional cuisine. Very early the following morning, we were on our way\
  \ to the famous Obudu Cattle Ranch at Obudu local government in Cross River state.\
  \ Obudu cattle ranch appealed to the eyes and it was a wonderful place to behold.\
  \ The entrance to the ranch was decorated with a big cow head with long horns carved\
  \ out of wood. The ranch itself was atop a hill while at the base of the hill were\
  \ several buildings, guest houses of different designs, some built with planks,\
  \ others with bricks. Also at the arrival office of the ranch were various cultural\
  \ artefacts on display for tourists. There was a standard sized swimming pool at\
  \ one of the hotels and the lawn around the place was well kept. We slept at the\
  \ base on the first night, then very early the second day we departed for the cable\
  \ car station. The cable car was a mini bus that could accommodate a maximum of\
  \ five people, it had a hook at the top through which it moved along a very strong\
  \ cable. We were educated at the cable car station on how safe the cable car was\
  \ and how it was the latest technology in the world. My cable car departed the station\
  \ and soon we were off the ground, only suspended in the car with a hook attached\
  \ to the cable. Each downward movement of the cable car saw me and my crew perspiring."
