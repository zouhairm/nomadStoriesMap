Text: "For many years, I traversed the globe not realizing that my very first travel\
  \ at barely five years old would initiate who I would become. It was a remarkable\
  \ peregrination, bestowed with efficacious lessons I could not register then, and\
  \ even later, did not expect to find.\n     This journey began one ordinary morning\
  \ when I left Saigon with my father and little brother. We stood facing my mother\
  \ at the train station; it was her grand goodbye to us, a parting surreptiously\
  \ planned and intended to be insignificant. In actuality, I was standing before\
  \ a monumental moment, but its affectivity escaped me: I can't even remember it.\
  \ Nevertheless, the ensuing concatenation of events would be even more monumental\
  \ and I would began to remember...\n     I remember being in a crowded train, sitting\
  \ next to strangers, and suffering a bout of anxiety whenever Father was out of\
  \ sight -- I felt so lost! Fortunately, he would reappear and I would be reassured.\
  \ Perhaps that is why, years later, getting lost does not worry me, for I am always\
  \ somewhere, not nowhere. And while I was occasionally left in the care of strangers,\
  \ Little Brother always had Father. That experience was effectively a springboard\
  \ to my being independent, especially.\n     We headed north to Hanoi on the Reunification\
  \ train, then fled to southeast China, hoping for a boat to Hong Kong. We tried\
  \ for a boat one night, but it was full, leaving us behind to wander in darkness,\
  \ in peril. Nearby, buffaloes stood fixed, dogs barked, and crickets chirped. At\
  \ one point, Father stumbled over a gravesite and kowtowed for forgiveness. Then,\
  \ strangely, a stranger appeared and sheltered us. Whatever reason made him apologize\
  \ to no one, but some bones some feet under, it was wisdom, quite frankly. There\
  \ presented an opportune lesson, though adventitious, to always respect my surroundings\
  \ and people -- offend no BODY no matter where!\n     Eventually, we found another\
  \ boat (heading to Macau) and boarded a thirty-footer that floated about thirty\
  \ skinny people for thirty long days. Go figure! The future me would discern such\
  \ coincidence as plain sailing and in hindsight, it would have been safe to interpret\
  \ that as fair winds ahead, but the reality at the time spared no room for such\
  \ an insouciant thought.\n     There were challenges during the passage, particularly\
  \ with food and sea conditions.  At some point, Father threatened to fight because\
  \ he was fed up with our food ration being calculated unfairly, thereby gaining\
  \ us a bit more portion.  On another occasion, the sea threw a tantrum and everyone\
  \ became seasick, except us.  An astounded lady remarked upon our vigor, but on\
  \ that cue, I coughed up what paltry food was left undigested. \n     \"Say no more!\"\
  \ Father exclaimed, fearing that we just got jinxed. Looking back, that incident\
  \ taught me to count my blessings and to not let my guards down, especially when\
  \ others have it rough.\n      As our sea trial approached the end and Father saw\
  \ a celebratory billboard advertising the refreshing Coca-Cola in its classic bottle,\
  \ his heart jumped with elation and he smiled marvelously for Macau, our haven.\
  \ A year and a half passed before we moved on to America, arriving there almost\
  \ exactly twenty-four months after our departure from Mother, from Vietnam. Years\
  \ zipped by and I adapted, and then adopted this foreign land as my beloved country.\
  \ When I was almost an adult, I was posed a peculiar question:  Are you American\
  \ or are you Asian? And I would be asked that again by various people. It was at\
  \ once annoying and enlightening.\n     Sure, I look Asian and eat Asian food, but\
  \ I was raised in America eating American fast food. I speak English fluently, but\
  \ now stumble with my native tongue. I left Vietnam hardly attending school only\
  \ to learn afresh and aplenty in America. Oftentimes, I do not feel I belong anywhere\
  \ or to any culture because I have been influenced by many places. To answer that\
  \ question I have to track back to the chapters of my life and rediscover how everything\
  \ led me to me.\n     The answer is quite unexpected.\n     I am a traveler -- that\
  \ is what I am. That IS what I became."
