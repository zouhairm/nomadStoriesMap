Text: "I didn\u2019t look forward to visiting my country of origin as a child. My\
  \ family and I moved to Italy from Albania when I was just four years old, and over\
  \ the years I ended up distancing myself from my homeland not just geographically\
  \ but also on an emotional level, as I rapidly and spontaneously acquired the culture\
  \ and the language of the new country. What I did unconsciously was to replace the\
  \ inner traces related to my native country that I had been assimilating during\
  \ my early childhood with other cultural footprints. It was only when I went back\
  \ to Berat \u2013 the town where I was born - at the age of 17 that my perspective\
  \ in this regard became clearer. In fact, that time I went to Albania driven by\
  \ the desire to reconnect with my roots, but I actually experienced a lot more and\
  \ now I\u2019m going to tell you how it went\u2026\nHave you ever been to a traditional\
  \ wedding in true Balkan style? Well, during my stay in Berat I did just so, since\
  \ there was my cousin\u2019s wedding. I soon discovered that Albanian weddings are\
  \ totally different in comparison to the Italian ones: they have to be always celebrated\
  \ on Sundays and starting from Thursday night, for the days prior to the wedding,\
  \ the bride and groom\u2019s parents put loud folk music on in their houses for\
  \ most of the day. The folk songs are purposely loud so that even the neighbourhood\
  \ can hear them! This is because in the Albanian tradition, marriages are considered\
  \ so important that they involve not just families and close friends, but also the\
  \ neighbours who can freely come by and wish the spouses a prosperous future as\
  \ a couple. At first, I found these local customs and the general shared excitement\
  \ quite odd and unfamiliar and I felt like a fish out of water, but at some point\
  \ I realized that if I had kept on making judgments, I would have denied myself\
  \ the chance to fully enjoy the festive atmosphere around me. Therefore, in true\
  \ Albanian style, I spent the rest of the days through nights of laughter and folk\
  \ dancing with a bunch of strangers, and eventually I felt right at home!\nEven\
  \ though I could understand it, I\u2019d lost the skill to speak my native tongue\
  \ fluently over the years. Anyway, during this particular journey I wanted to interact\
  \ a lot more with my grandma, something that I gave up doing in the previous years\
  \ mainly because of the language issue. Surprisingly, I wished I\u2019d done this\
  \ earlier, because, due to our willingness to understand one another, we managed\
  \ to communicate and empathise even across the language barrier. My grandma amused\
  \ me with funny and romantic stories about her teenage years, and even if my Albanian\
  \ was quite basic and a bit funny, we both appreciated the mutual attempt to understand\
  \ each other. \nMy grandma\u2019s house \u2013 where I stayed \u2013 was located\
  \ in a quiet rural part of the town and as it was the middle of summer, in the afternoons\
  \ I could enjoy the relaxing \u201Csinging\u201D of the cicadas combined with the\
  \ soft rustle of leaves and the pleasant breeze that would gently brush my skin,\
  \ an absolutely idyllic sensation which is quite rare in an urban environment much\
  \ like the one I live in Italy. As a child though, instead of appreciating special\
  \ things like this, I would compare the two realities and complain about the differences\
  \ most of the time. For example, I remember that when someone would invite me to\
  \ taste local food, I would be too fussy to try it. Only when I put aside prejudices\
  \ and complaints, I started experiencing things as they actually were and not as\
  \ I thought they might be. As my approach changed, I discovered that Albanian cuisine\
  \ is a lot influenced by the Turkish and the Greek cuisines, so its typical dishes,\
  \ apart from being really tasty, are also the products of historical heritage and\
  \ multicultural contacts! Overall, thanks to this journey I\u2019ve learnt that\
  \ curiosity and empathy are probably the most essential ingredients when it comes\
  \ to travelling."
