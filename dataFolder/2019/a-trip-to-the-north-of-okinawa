Text: "While a bit clich\xE9 to say, there is nothing like Spring Break--and that\
  \ is true even in Japan.  I was in Osaka for a semester-long study abroad, and my\
  \ spring break plans included a visit to both Tokyo and Okinawa, all within one\
  \ week.  My time in Tokyo was excellent.  I was able to meet a few friends from\
  \ the area and see many of the sights I had bookmarked in my trusty guidebook. \
  \ Even got to check a stay at a capsule hotel off of my list.  Still, my trip to\
  \ Okinawa loomed somewhat ominously.  I would travel incognito and did not have\
  \ a full grasp on the Japanese language.\n     The AirAsia flight landed in Naha\
  \ and I managed to find my way to to my beachfront hotel via a convenient monorail\
  \ system and my own two feet.  The first few days on the island were spent visiting\
  \ some Ryukyu Kingdom historical sights and nearby museums in the city.  I was looking\
  \ for a little more adventure though, and decided to try and venture to the far\
  \ north of the island.  What's more--most of the beaches I found in the city were\
  \ closed due to the early March temperatures.  I wanted a beach that was open.\n\
  \     I visited the large bus stop not far from my hotel and struggled to communicate\
  \ my destination.  While I thought I did a good enough job, I was eventually led\
  \ to the one employee that spoke passable English.  I was grateful.  He told me\
  \ exactly where and when to stand to head off to the Ocean Expo Park in Nago.  This\
  \ complex included Emerald Beach, which I understood was open.  The next day I followed\
  \ his instructions and hopped on a bus for a three-hour trip through the wilderness--after\
  \ leaving the large metropolitan area that is.  It was a beautiful ride through\
  \ the woods and along the ocean.\n     The centerpiece of the Ocean Expo Park was\
  \ the Churaumi Aquarium, which I had little interest in despite the good reviews.\
  \  Once off the bus, I headed to the north edge of the property for Emerald Beach--only\
  \ to find out through multiple people that the beach was actually closed until the\
  \ first weekend of April.  Apparently I looked lost enough to get some extra help\
  \ from the employees.  They let me know of a swimming place on the coast within\
  \ walking distance from the large complex.  I followed their directions to find\
  \ a wonderful blue swimming hole sheltered from the waves that many others were\
  \ already snorkeling in.  The water was certainly cold, but the experience was worth\
  \ it.\n     After this, it was early afternoon.  I decided to venture back to the\
  \ Expo Park, and again headed straight past the large, impressive aquarium.  All\
  \ the people in attendance seemed to be in the aquatic area, and the rest of the\
  \ complex seemed nearly deserted.  I followed signs and continued walking south,\
  \ through some forest walkways and a replica of a native Ryukyu village.  After\
  \ a long walk I reached the Tropical Dream Center--a breathtaking complex of plants\
  \ and sculptures.  This was also deserted.  The aquarium must have been a real draw.\n\
  \     I had a few hours left before the return bus, so I continued walking south\
  \ through the Tropical and Subtropical Arboretum Areas.  The Expo Park was little\
  \ more than a normal park down at this end, with little to do as far as touristic\
  \ things.  The plants and views were beautiful, and the lack of people for several\
  \ hours now felt surreal and slightly unnerving.  I decided to go the Banko Forest\
  \ at the end of the long path before walking back.  On the way there I encountered\
  \ hedge mazes and elegant sculpture gardens.\n     My isolationist journey ended\
  \ at the Banko Forest, which turned out to be only a children's area with several\
  \ families.  As it was getting dark, I quickly headed back to the main part of the\
  \ park to stand by my bus stop for the bus that I hoped would come.  It did, right\
  \ on schedule, and I was soon heading back through the dark landscapes to the city,\
  \ having had a self-defining and memorable day all alone in Japan."
