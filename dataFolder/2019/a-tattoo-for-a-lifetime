Text: "There they were. Numbers engraved into this old man\u2019s arm, burning their\
  \ way through my eyes with their grey and partly vanished ink. A tattoo for a lifetime,\
  \ a tattoo of which I thought people would try to get rid of. But there he was,\
  \ this old man, holding up his arm and showing one of the most cruel memories of\
  \ mankind, partly with pride, partly with the doubt on his face about whether I\
  \ would believe him or not. He was a survivor. \u201CI was in Auschwitz.\u201D he\
  \ said.\n\nIt was one of these colorful, early summer days. The world was dunk into\
  \ sunshine and the air smelled fresh and light, when I jumped into a train with\
  \ the destination Nancy, France. The train should lead me through the southern part\
  \ of Germany. It was an 8-hour train ride and I wanted to let my thoughts wonder\
  \ around, while staring outside of the window to see the beautiful endless green\
  \ fields rushing by. My head was empty, when I realized that an older man was sitting\
  \ across from me. I didn\u2019t know for how long he has been sitting there, but\
  \ what I noticed immediately was that he was one of the talkative people. I wasn\u2019\
  t really in the mood to talk, but when he saw that I was a traveler, he opened the\
  \ conversation about the good old times and how these were actually not good old\
  \ times, but somewhat darker than now and how beautiful it is that everyone can\
  \ travel nowadays.  I gave him a brief smile knowing that the chat wouldn\u2019\
  t end here, so I tried to force myself to engage into this conversation. How come\
  \ he was so passionate about traveling?\n\u201CI have a mission\u201D, he told me.\
  \ He was a traveler, a restless mind himself, he used to live in South Africa, moved\
  \ to New York and now came back to Germany because he was on this special mission.\
  \ \nThe train just went along his story and I wondered how a man that age, he was\
  \ around 90 already, was so full of life and curiosity. He carried such a young\
  \ and interesting soul in an old body around, so I finally asked him about the mission\
  \ he mentioned.\nAnd in that moment, without any hesitation, he rolled up his sleeves\
  \ and showed me the horrific numbers that were engraved into his lower arm. A sudden\
  \ silence filled the empty wagon of the train. The old man had a fierce look, as\
  \ if he was trying to determine if I was good or evil. But his oval-shaped dark\
  \ brown eyes were filled with kindness and trust when he broke the silence.\n\n\
  His travel story started with his deportation by the Nazis to the Netherlands and\
  \ from there across whole Germany. Once he was saved in 1945 and fully recovered,\
  \ he was hiding for a few years. Only at a high age he decided to come back to Germany\
  \ to start a journey of sharing his story in schools. He talked freely and vivid\
  \ about his past, there was no pain involved, just a certain relief that today was\
  \ different. \n\nHe was a survivor, a traveler, an open minded person with a travel\
  \ mission. And I realized the reason he still carried his tattoo was, that he wanted\
  \ to remind the people to stay open and be aware of the gruesome past that once\
  \ was so real on so many Central European grounds. Everyone has a different travel\
  \ story, it is not always pleasure, it is a mission to educate, wherever you go.\
  \ You are a part of history and it is our duty to tell the stories we experience.\
  \ The tattoo was his reminder that history cannot repeat itself.\n\nAs the train\
  \ got closer to the boarder of Germany and France he slowly got up and thanked me\
  \ for sharing the ride. He arrived at his destination, his birth town where his\
  \ father once had a candy shop. When he was just about to head out of the wagon\
  \ he said: \u201CMy name is Heinz, so you don\u2019t remember me by the numbers\
  \ on my arm.\u201D"
