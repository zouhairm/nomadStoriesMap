Text: "Nothing is sweet than going for a trip, I was always stressed up with my college\
  \ work that I forgot about life. So I took a week vacation to the the pearl of Indian\
  \ Ocean, \"Sri Lanka\". Sri Lanka is my motherland but I spend my 15 years of studies\
  \ in India that I forgot the beauty of Sri Lanka. I use to hate Sri Lanka cause\
  \ of my relatives, always behind me. But this time I didn't want to spend my time\
  \ at visiting my family that I took a train trip to Galle, one of the magical places\
  \ in Sri Lanka. Galle I would describe as a place of dreams, magical, peaceful.\
  \ When I entered the place  Galle, I was truly love struck. The place was peaceful,\
  \ colour textured. I can smell the breeze of the sea, the gulls singing, the hawkers\
  \ shouting in their language, Singhalese. \n\nI didn't want to stay in a high five\
  \ hotel and camped at a boutique hotel which was near the breeze, luckily my room\
  \ was next to the beach view. \n\nSo I started my adventure by starting with old\
  \ galle, I started by visiting the old galle fort. A city made by the Dutch around\
  \ 1663 I guess. The fort covered the entire area and there were shops, restaurants\
  \ everywhere. This place was covered with poets, writers, and mostly foreigners\
  \ and some decided to settle at the Galle fort by setting houses.\n\nSo Galle fort\
  \ was covered with religious places like temples, church and mosques made with great\
  \ architecture. \n \nLater I started watching the beach, stayed till the sunset,\
  \ walked to the narrow pathway. Sri Lankans loved to walk in this narrow pathway\
  \ as it was like a jog for them.\n\nAfter a long day in beautiful Galle Fort, nothing\
  \ is better than having a nice with a Sri Lankan meal- I had the greatest and the\
  \ most traditional food in Sri Lanka that is  curry, rice, papadums, beetroot with\
  \ cinnamon, sweet potatoes, green beans, dhal, and sambals which locals call, \"\
  \ Kiri bath\".m It was really good! I really could taste the food mum prepares for\
  \ me whenever she's in Colombo.   I sat in the rooftop of the  restaurant with spectacular\
  \ view of the sea and waves ringing to my ear. So I stayed in Galle for 3 days \n\
  \nThe next trip was Ella, which I took a day trip by train. I decided to see the\
  \ hill top of Sri Lanka. Ella was famous for falls especially the places made by\
  \ the Demon king, Ravan. \n\nElla as I can describe is a peaceful small village\
  \ site in the middle of a beautiful green countryside, with spectacular views! clear\
  \ skies, it's actually hot during the day and cold during the night.\n\nElla is\
  \ nested with 1000m of elevation. You could see farmlands growing vegetables, tea\
  \ plantations, and rice fields  making the landscape very lush and green. Places\
  \ covered with small shops, museum and you find anything what you want as villagers\
  \ too can speak English.\n\nWhat people come to Ella for is the hiking. Ella is\
  \ a spectacular place for hiking! So I hiked to Adams peak. I may got cuts, tired\
  \ myself but anyhow reached the peak of adam and could see the view of the hills\
  \ of Sri Lanka. \n\nI spend my trip in Ella visiting the Ravan falls, bathing in\
  \ it. I visited the palace which was just a tiring tour, I visited tea plantations.\
  \ Met tea pluckers, Ella was famous for strawberries. \n\nAnd then went back to\
  \ Colombo to meet my family though it was not actually my plan but I anyhow visited,\
  \ I spend the night with my cousin and had a great dinner and tasted the king of\
  \ foods, kottu. I can hear the fast cutting of the roti. The next day I visited\
  \ Colombo fort, the independence hall, parliament place, where it was pure rich\
  \ in buying things up to your budget. I sat to see a movie I don't even understand\
  \ but enjoyed the thrills and cheers from the fans out there.\n\nAlas it was time\
  \ to head back home  to Bangalore, but to tell the truth I had a blast visiting\
  \ home."
