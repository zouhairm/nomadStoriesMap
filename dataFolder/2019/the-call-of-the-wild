Text: "As we flew over the scenic regions of Tanzania, we ogled at the picturesque\
  \ snow capped Mount Kilimanjaro from the right side of the plane and the Ngorongoro\
  \ crater from the left. While the plane was descending, we could make out scattered\
  \ herds of buffalo and wildebeests that appear like little black ants dotted across\
  \ the extensive plains of the African savannah. Upon landing at the Seronera airstrip,\
  \ we were ushered to a busy waiting room packed with mainly American and European\
  \ retirees, all stylishly decked out in smart looking safari explorer inspired outfits.\
  \ Their khaki coloured sartorial inclinations and ensembles reminded me very much\
  \ of a fusion between Indiana Jones and Ralph Lauren. \n\nEn route to our safari\
  \ lodge, the geographical terrains and typography dramatically shifts and changes\
  \ rapidly. Green undulating hills and mesmerizing flatiron rock boulder formations\
  \ set against cyan blue skies sprinkled with fluffy tufts of gossamer cirrus clouds\
  \ make the most stunning backdrops. The endless plains and vast landscapes stretched\
  \ as far as the eyes could see, and are littered with the ubiquitous prancing impalas\
  \ and hartebeests. Statuesque giraffes saunter across the boundless grasslands filled\
  \ with iconic acacia trees housing swallow\u2019s nests. At times, our vehicle bobbing\
  \ up and down on the bumpy dirt roads will come up just mere centimetres away from\
  \ the precariously long and prickly spikes of whistling thorn bushes. Our convoy\
  \ stops by a bloat of hefty hippopotamus cooling themselves off in the river. The\
  \ broad canopies of umbrella thorn trees provide much needed shade and reprieve\
  \ from the scorching heat for these sun sensitive \u2018river horses\u2019. Every\
  \ minute or so, a rotund hippo will entertain us by surfacing up to yawn and blow\
  \ out a fine mist of air bubbles that dissipates into a fleeting rainbow. Nearby,\
  \ sinister looking Nile crocodiles lazed by the riverbanks, as a troop of furry\
  \ baboons curiously looked on from a safe distance by the babbling brooks. Everything\
  \ that I saw and experienced while on the fifty minutes ride to the lodge reminded\
  \ me of descriptions straight out of Danish Baroness Karen Blixen\u2019s memoirs\
  \  \u201COut of Africa\u201D.\n\nThe great wildebeest migration that takes place\
  \ annually is the largest overland terrestrial mammal migration spectacle on this\
  \ planet. Starting from the Serengeti national parks in Tanzania, a staggering 1.5\
  \ million animals fend for their very lives while attempting to cross the Grumeti\
  \ and Mara rivers in a chaotic frenzy to get over to Maasai Marai game reserve in\
  \ Kenya in search of fresh grazing grounds and drinkable water. The whole river-crossing\
  \ scene looks like a surreal apocalyptic cesspit filled with fear, anxiety, and\
  \ panic. Amidst the maddening mayhem, upset mother wildebeests frequently lose sight\
  \ of their forlorn new-borns in the frantic disarray of horns, hooves, and hides.\
  \ This is Darwinian\u2019s evolutionary theory of \u201Cthe survival of the fittest\u201D\
  \ at its most raw, unadulterated, and animalistic. By nightfall, nocturnal scavengers\
  \ such as bands of sly jackals and cackling hyenas with their nefarious grins come\
  \ out to scour the battlefields for any gory leftovers that the hungry vultures\
  \ might have left out. \n\nThere is something enchanted and ineffable about seeing\
  \ these safari game creatures roaming freely and flourishing in their natural environments.\
  \ The animals are happy, healthy, active, and fit as can be as evident from their\
  \ robust musculature, luscious eyes, and glossy hides. This is in sharp opposition\
  \ compared to the lacklustre and languid animals that we see neurotically pacing\
  \ inside tiny cages at city zoos. Unperturbed by our presence, lions and elephants\
  \ will walk right next to our land rover. There was a palpable electrifying energy\
  \ in the atmosphere and an elusive \u201Cje ne sais quoi\u2019\u201D quality to\
  \ it all. One is left to wonder how these capricious and unpredictable wild animals\
  \ might behave next. My inner child was beaming and I was so trigger-happy with\
  \ my camera that I ran out of both battery power and memory card storage space.\
  \ With a pair of binoculars in my left hand, and my camera in my right, I thought\
  \ to myself that this has got to be the best day of my life. I felt like a kid living\
  \ out his childhood fantasy from Walt Disney\u2019s \u201CThe Lion King\u201D."
