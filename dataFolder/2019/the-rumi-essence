Text: "December 4, she said, mild depression\nJanuary 4, I decided, wild vacation\
  \ \nTraversing through the woods in the intercity rail, \nTo achieve nothing - my\
  \ holy grail\nGazing out at the fresh green, then across, noticing the charming\
  \ family pack \nLullabied into a pendulum slumber by the train track (here\u2019\
  s a pun, to add to some whack)\nJust as I flipped another page of my Jerry Pinto,\
  \ \n\u201CWhat are you reading? Can I take a look?\u201D said the man, eyeing it\
  \ with a squint \n\u201COh, sure\u201D and so began the usual banter, now with a\
  \ glint \nI learnt of the Biblical origins of his name, and before we knew,\nPavel\
  \ and I found ourselves arrived, waiting at the taxi stand undecidedly, until there\
  \ remained just a few\n\u201CWhere are you headed?\u201D \n\u201CI don\u2019t know\u201D\
  \nSo, we hopped onto a taxi, asked the driver to drop us along a familiar route\n\
  Only to find my dear traveller friend, Hrishik, roaming about  \nMysterious and\
  \ kind, graciously offering to walk us to a makeshift bamboo shack \nHe insisted,\
  \ \u201CJust a short walk. Come on, let me carry your backpack\u201D\nAnd just like\
  \ that, with ease and breeze, some company for my tired feet, \nSlipping over majestic\
  \ rocks, we paused, expanding our sight into where the blues greet\nEach other,\
  \ in blur and a silent usher \nSand for floor, candle flame for light, waves to\
  \ wake up to,\nMy humble abode was just right \nBut the gods had other plans - Off\
  \ we went from Half-moon beach to Paradise, \nAs Hrishik, a blessing in disguise,\
  \ offered his hammock for a sweet paralyze, \nIn the dead of the night, the night\
  \ was alive with stars beaming into our eyes, \n\u201CYou want to see planktons\
  \ in the ocean? This is the time.\u201D \nEcstatic, I stripped out of my clothes,\
  \ made a run for the sea,\nAnd whaaaaaaaat did I see?\nLiving stars in the ocean\
  \ that moved with me\nSplashing myself with this bioluminescence, filled with such\
  \ effervescence \nI took a dip and another, downed a sip and went further, to be\
  \ engulfed by what they call The Rumi Essence\nThe surface of the sea was indeed\
  \ a mirror to the sky above me!\nI dipped in nature, I slept in nature, tossed away\
  \ the concrete ceiling \nLapped in a blanket, swung in a hammock, palm shade for\
  \ the dreamy morning eyes, \nHere I am putting words to this inexplicable healing\n\
  I didn\u2019t expect anything of what unfolded\nBut I\u2019m glad I went ahead anyway,\
  \ blindfolded\nOnly to be remolded."
