Text: "Your ticket miss? \u2014 a white-toothed conductor asked me on the train from\
  \ Glen Cove to New York. Of course I had a ticket, but it was lying somewhere in\
  \ a bottomless backpack, in which there were a jacket, fruits, sandwiches, a bottle\
  \ of water, a red umbrella and a whole bunch of small things that should have been\
  \ useful during the day in Big Apple, right?  \nIn front of me a man with big blue\
  \ eyes and messy hair was sitting. Can I help you? \u2014 he asked me with a smile\
  \ and sparks in his eyes. It was weird to hear his question. In Belarus, country\
  \ where I am from, a stranger rarely hurries to assist in such a situation, he would\
  \ rather wait for a real catastrophe or do nothing. Being shy and looking at my\
  \ knees, I said that was fine. I found a crumpled ticket and gave it to the conductor.\
  \ \nCentral station. I was standing at the door of the braking train. The stranger\
  \ stood next to me and wondered where I was going. The first point of my plan was\
  \ the Rockefeller Tower \u2014 I was seeking to see an aw-inspiring view from the\
  \ top. He offered to guide me so that I would not get lost. While we were walking\
  \ he was curious where I was from and what I was doing in New York. I felt his sincere\
  \ interest and was struck by his openness and tact. He brought me to the park on\
  \ Sixth Avenue, stopped and showed where I should go further - he apologized he\
  \ needed to go to the office and he could not continue the tour. He gave me his\
  \ number (on the contrary in Belarusian men often asks for a girl\u2019s number)\
  \ and said that if I had any problems, would text him and not be shy, because he\
  \ would gladly help me. My cheeks ached with a grateful smile. I believed that there\
  \ were wonderful people who loved to be useful just for nothing.\n11 p.m. I was\
  \ back at the station. Of course, I had not call my stranger (by the way, his name\
  \ is Robert). I was waiting for my train, which would take my tired legs straight\
  \ to a lonely mattress in my rented apartment. Staring at people and imagining what\
  \ each of them could do, I met the gaze with the big blue eyes. Robert stood on\
  \ platform number 5 at 20 paces from me. How could it be?! We came to each other\
  \ and laughed hysterically. \nAll the way back, we were talking about his work,\
  \ about my big American trip, about his children and a puppy, and whether all Americans\
  \ were like him. Robert offered to throw me on his car when he found out that from\
  \ the last stop I had to drive another 10 kilometers by bicycle to my house. I tiredly\
  \ agreed. \nRobert has become my good friend. We met a lot and even ran together\
  \ in the morning. He showed me California and Montauk, taught how to grow tomatoes,\
  \ and I taught him how to treat indigestion with mint tea. Two years have passed\
  \ since then. We still send post cards to each other on holidays and plan to meet\
  \ somewhere in Europe."
