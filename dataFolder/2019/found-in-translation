Text: "My grandmother left Vietnam in 1972 when she was just 23 years old, leaving\
  \ with my grandfather and 3 little boys. She left Saigon in the midst of inconclusive\
  \ peace treaties between the US and Vietnam just three years before Saigon would\
  \ formally reunify with the Socialist Republic of Vietnam. She left behind her brothers\
  \ and sisters to start an American life. My situation could not have been more drastically\
  \ different as I arrived in Vietnam for the first time at 21 with my parents. We\
  \ arrived at the Ho Chi Minh city airport prepared to meet the family that my grandmother\
  \ had left behind. \n\nWe weaved through the organized chaos of the airport trying\
  \ to locate family whose faces we had never seen. \n\nMy father was quiet, I could\
  \ tell he was nervous. He left Vietnam 45 years and had lost his ability to speak\
  \ Vietnamese as a little boy assimilating into American culture in Ligonier Pennsylvania.\
  \ My father had learned to suppress his differences as people of Vietnamese descent\
  \ were viewed with suspicion after the war. \n\nWe coordinated our trip with my\
  \ grandmother\u2019s niece Kieu My who told us, \n\u201CThey\u2019ll be waiting\
  \ for you at the airport with a van.\u201D  \nWe had no idea who that \u2018us\u2019\
  \ meant or why it warranted an entire van. We only knew that we would be staying\
  \ with my grandmother\u2019s youngest sister\u2019s M\u01B0\u1EDDi for the next\
  \ four days. \n\nI scanned the transient faces in the crowd hoping someone would\
  \ show a sign of recognition. \nOur family saw us before we saw them. A group of\
  \ about ten people gasped, smiled, or cried as they gestured to us signaling that\
  \ they had found who they were looking for. \n\nWe approached the crowd of young\
  \ and old and began to exchange names and hugs. We met M\u01B0\u1EDDi who was crying\
  \ tears of happiness. She spoke to us in Vietnamese while we could only respond\
  \ with helpless smiles and \u2018thank you\u2019s\u2019. M\u01B0\u1EDDi reached\
  \ for the little girl next to her who looked around 8 years old and repeated her\
  \ statement in Vietnamese. \nThe girl then spoke to us slowly in English, she said,\
  \ \u201CAunt M\u01B0\u1EDDi says she is very happy you are here.\u201D \n\nIt soon\
  \ became evident that communication would be slow as the only family members who\
  \ could speak Vietnamese and English were my two little cousins, aged 8 and 13.\n\
  \nI asked this little girl her name and how she knew English, she responded with\
  \ intense concentration explaining, \u201CMy name is Nguy\u1EC5n and I go to school\
  \ on the weekends with my sister to study English.\u201D I later learned that Nguy\u1EC5\
  n\u2019s ability to speak English, although time-consuming and expensive, is an\
  \ investment for her future as many young Vietnamese children dream of attending\
  \ school in the US.\n\nWe communicated with hugs, smiles, and hand squeezes. My\
  \ great uncle said the few English words he knew exclaiming, \u201CVery happy\u201D\
  \ while the other members had little Nguy\u1EC5n repeatedly translate \u201CIt has\
  \ been so long since Frank was in Vietnam.\u201D And \u201CWe love you and your\
  \ family.\u201D I have never felt so much love from people I had just met. \n\n\
  Their warm disposition and words made me forget that these people were strangers\
  \ to me just fifteen minutes ago."
