Text: "You must have heard about CouchSurfing hospitality service. People from all\
  \ around the world host each other and surf each other\u2019s couches. There are\
  \ few places in the world which can compete with this country in terms of hospitality.\
  \ Still, you must have heard that lots of things are forbidden in Iran, including\
  \ CouchSurfing. In fact, it is widely used in Iran, but you should not disclose\
  \ you\u2019re using it.\n\nIt was early September, +40 C outside. We have travelled\
  \ half of the country. Our next destination was a mountain Kurdish town next to\
  \ the Iraqi border. \u201CIt\u2019s one of the most beautiful mountain town in the\
  \ region,\u201D we read in Lonely Planet. The day before the trip we texted to our\
  \ next host. He confirmed he was waiting for us and also wrote, \u201CSorry, I can\u2019\
  t pick you up, my wife had a baby today. So my friend will meet you.\u201D What?!\
  \ A babyborn?! We felt frustrated and lost at the same time. \u201CAre you sure\
  \ it\u2019s fine if we come?\u201D - \u201CYes, we\u2019re waiting for you.\u201D\
  \n\nWe wondered what to expect. In Ukraine, our home country, you don\u2019t accept\
  \ guests when you have a baby born in your house. Once, I didn\u2019t see my close\
  \ friend until her child turned 6 months old. \n\nWe didn\u2019t have plan B and\
  \ decided to go to our hospitable friend-to-be and see what happens. While in the\
  \ town, met by his colleague, we were brought to the house and introduced to our\
  \ host Abbas, his wife, the baby born, its grandparents and aunts. Then we were\
  \ having slow talks over endless tea ceremony. \n\nIt was getting dark when we saw\
  \ more people coming to the house. \u201CThis is the day when all our relatives\
  \ and neighbors come to greet the baby born and its parents,\u201D they explained\
  \ to us. Ten people, twenty people, then we lost count of people. Few of them were\
  \ speaking English, but we were having long discussions till midnight, using our\
  \ body language and very simple phrases. Tired and overwhelmed, I went asleep on\
  \ the floor in the room of Abbas' mother-in-low. While starting my Iranian travel,I\
  \ could never imagine to end up in a local Iranian family with a baby born in the\
  \ next room. God bless CouchSurfind!"
