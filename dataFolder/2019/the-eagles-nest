Text: "Jagged stones take to the car like hacksaws, catapulted from the cars tyres\
  \ beneath. It\u2019s the day after a night of wild storms that have lashed the Styx\
  \ Valley in Tasmania, but does it look any different because of this? Patches of\
  \ decimated trees lay haphazardly along the side of the road guarded by big yellow\
  \ caterpillar\u2019s, just one weapon in the logging industries arsenal. \n\nThe\
  \ sky is a stormy grey, the air charged with an earthy aroma. Raindrops spew intermittently\
  \ against a backdrop of defiant trees mourning over fallen comrades. We haven\u2019\
  t passed another human soul in a solid 40 minutes when we see the first sign warning\
  \ us. We are in logging country now. Turn back. Do not enter. \n\nMy friend and\
  \ I are meandering along a road that has no name, past giant trees and temporarily\
  \ discarded logging equipment; the mountains soaring above and the beautiful Styx\
  \ river stained a deep clear brown. We are in search of Tasmania\u2019s tallest\
  \ trees. Particular pockets of ancient giants we have heard whispers about, found\
  \ scribbles of in second-hand maps and dredged from the depths of the internet.\
  \ This patchwork of information ensures we don't really know what it is we are looking\
  \ for. We drive slowly on the unsealed roads dodging potholes and rocks, blatantly\
  \ flaunting the terms and conditions of our hire car. We laugh nervously with the\
  \ ding of ever pebble ricocheting off the chassis.\n\nThere are no signs or directions\
  \ plastered on giant green boards warning us where to stop or where to turn. We\
  \ read the terrain, looking out for various features those before us have noted\
  \ - forks in the road, stretches of rivers, mountain formations and distinct trees.\
  \ We estimate that we have about 20 minutes left to drive before we need to pick\
  \ up the journey on foot. \n\nAs we round a corner we are abruptly halted by a large\
  \ tree we did not expect. It has fallen naturally in last night\u2019s storm and\
  \ laid itself to rest over the road. Almost in protest against the destruction occurring\
  \ in the valley. We sit in a kind of calm disappointment. After deciding there is\
  \ no way forward and with the rain still falling we agree to turn back.\n\nLike\
  \ all good adventures, time passes differently. After a while of driving back along\
  \ the road we start to feel we are approaching where we started but we can\u2019\
  t be sure. We round a  sharp corner and screech to a halt. There in front of us\
  \ is a enormous wedge tail eagle, as giant as the standing trees around us. The\
  \ upward slope we teeter on puts us at eye level with the creature, perched only\
  \ metres away. It\u2019s devouring a wombat carcass, and we stare in childlike reverence\
  \ \u2013 unable to believe the sheer size of the thing. The textbooks never prepared\
  \ us for this. In that moment we feel small. I\u2019m sure there is nothing in the\
  \ hire car fine print about eagle attacks? \n\nThe eagle, steadfast, finishes it\u2019\
  s mouthful. It\u2019s eyes trained on us through the windshield. We are face to\
  \ face with an eagle in what many call \u2018Tolkien country\u2019, the symbolism\
  \ is not lost on us. Almost as though it is hearing our thoughts it prepares to\
  \ take off. Stretching it\u2019s wings it jostles towards us before breaking into\
  \ a charge. It\u2019s eyes still trained on us. It\u2019s huge and it\u2019s fast.\
  \ It\u2019s coming right at us. We duck instinctually, despite being in the car,\
  \ as in the last seconds before collision it\u2019s wings outstretch and its claws\
  \ launch it upwards. We can hear the stones fleeing beneath the great eagle\u2019\
  s feet and the whoosh of its wings as it passes directly above us. \n\nWe sit in\
  \ awed silence."
