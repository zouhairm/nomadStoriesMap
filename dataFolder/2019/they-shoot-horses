Text: "Oh, the dung beetle! What a terrible fate to have a team of kids find interest\
  \ in your existence, I can only imagine it\u2019s fear to this day as they all gather\
  \ around it while Fahron pokes it with a stick he found in the attic of the local\
  \ church. Soccer was a morning communion in Freetown, the rising of the sun signaling\
  \ the weeks end. For the local children this meant the transition from weekly responsibilities,\
  \ such as crab fishing, and twisting organic hemp wicker, to 48 hours of unsupervised\
  \ freedom. This group of kids in particular, \u201CThe Preying Mantises\u201D they\
  \ prefered to be called, spent every Saturday morning gathering near a field a few\
  \ blocks away from the port to play soccer. I can honestly say to this day, I have\
  \ yet to see a professional game as entertaining, and intense as the one I witnessed\
  \ between these kids. A mangled mash up of twisted legs, powerful burst of energy,\
  \  pushing, shoving, lost toothed smiles, and of course, the occasional flow of\
  \ tears. \u201CI am the flame of Futbol\u201D, one kid would exclaim as he marched\
  \ and stomped about the field, arms swinging, head held high after making yet another\
  \ goal. The kid was good, averaging about 4-5 shots a game which I shamelessly was\
  \ keeping track of. In fact, I was so enveloped in his victory lap, that I hadn\u2019\
  t caught what a little girl found to be extremely important. \u201CWait, stop! You\
  \ almost stepped on that Dune bug!\u201D You could almost feel the energy of the\
  \ field perk up, so much so that I too was interested. Dune bug? Never in my 20\
  \ years of living have I heard of that, I remember having the faint notion that\
  \ this could potentially  be some foreign insect I could only find during my time\
  \ abroad. As the kids and I shifted our focus though, we found a quiet little dung\
  \ beetle, pushing a ball of feces slowly along the field. I simply gave off a chuckle,\
  \ the children became vultures. They were on it in an instant. \u201CWhat do you\
  \ think it\u2019s thinking?\u201D \u201CCut it open.\u201D \u201CGive it a rock\
  \ and see if it can push it.\u201D \u201CHand me that stick.\u201D The next few\
  \ moments were some of interest. I zoned out for a while, watching a barg break\
  \ away from the port and sail out into the blend, until I heard something that snapped\
  \ me back into the conversation. \u201CWhat is Buddhism?\u201D One kid asked. \u201C\
  It\u2019s when you\u2019re dead and come back as something else.\u201D A girl gave\
  \ a face of contempt. \u201CYou would come back as this, Alias?\u201D Another kid\
  \ perked up, \u201CI would be an alligator. Pap says Alligators can rip through\
  \ anything.\u201D \u201CI would be a chip.\u201D All the kids burst into fits of\
  \ laughter. \u201CI would be a ball.\u201D \u201CI would be a mouse.\u201D \u201C\
  What\u2019s that thing called that spits?\u201D \u201CLlama!\u201D More laughter.\
  \ \u201CI would be a llama!\u201D \u201C I would be a Horse.\u201D \u201CI wouldn\u2019\
  t be a horse.\u201D \u201CWhy not?\u201D \u201CBecause they shoot horses.\u201D\
  \ \u201CWhat?\u201D The kids continued to poke at the helpless insect, who at this\
  \ point abandoned his quest, and was simply seeking an escape of any kind. \u201C\
  Who shoots horses?\u201D I asked after a shirt space if time trying to understand\
  \ that statement. The kid in front of me shrugged, \u201CI don\u2019t know, I saw\
  \ a white man do it once on TV. He shot the horse,\u201D the kids right hand began\
  \ to mimic a gun, \u201Cand put on his hat and started marching.\u201D I was feeling\
  \ a little uneasy, but mostly still confused, when the kid continued, \u201CMy mom\
  \ says white men do it all the time, they use it until they don\u2019t need it,\
  \ and then they shoot horses. Sometimes they shoot people.\u201D This big statement\
  \ coming from the mouth of a child who just moments earlier was laughing about a\
  \ Llama, sent me into a spiral. Their conversation continued normally before they\
  \ all decided to head back to eat. I chaperoned them home, and found myself a quiet\
  \ place by the port to read that night, the image of a murdered horse forever trapped\
  \ in my mind."
