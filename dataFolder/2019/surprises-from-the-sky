Text: "I'm in love with northern lights. I have tried to find them three times, and\
  \ only one was successful (barely): Iceland. I traveled alone: I rented a truck\
  \ with a tent on the roof and wi-fi, I collected a lot of places on google maps,\
  \ I read about the forecasts of solar activity and icelandic weather, and I was\
  \ ready to start my roadtrip. I had almost an entire week, from sunday to saturday.\
  \ \nI started with Reykjanes peninsula, with the amazing bridge between continents\
  \ and Valahnukur, the first demonstrations of the unique geography of this island.\
  \ The sky was fully covered with clouds. Then I headed to Reykjavik, feeling the\
  \ compulsion to stop on every blue sign which marked a touristic attraction: craters,\
  \ little geysers, and just on the first day!\nThe clouds were getting dense with\
  \ every minute. I decided to start the week with Golden Circle. It was september,\
  \ and even with clouds, wind and cold, I fell in love with the views. A walk at\
  \ Thingvellir national park, the sunset at Geysir, and the night not far from there,\
  \ with a storm so strong and horrible, that I googled if it was possible that a\
  \ truck with a tent on the roof could overturn with strong winds. But I survived!\n\
  The next day I finished the Golden Circle: a relaxing time at Secret Lagoon, I visited\
  \ Gullfoss with rain, I had a pause at the stunning Kerid crater. When I approached\
  \ Reykjavik again, I had to decide: north or south? The weather forecast was slightly\
  \ better to the north, so I started the Ring Road on that direction. \nI drove straight\
  \ to Akureyri, the main city of the north, followed by the clouds. Another night\
  \ without northern lights. The next day, I decided to continue east to Egilsstadir,\
  \ not without taking some time to appreciate the impressive Godafoss and the beautiful\
  \ area of Myvatn. I thought that I was close enough to spend the night at Seydisfjordur,\
  \ so recommended on travel guides. The little rain that followed me all the way,\
  \ turned in heavy rain, which barely let me see the road, one of the most beautiful\
  \ and dangerous roads of Iceland. I cried behind the wheel! But I did it, again.\
  \ And the first light of the day let me enjoy that colourful path to the beautiful\
  \ church of the town. One less chance to see the northern lights, though. \nI had\
  \ to continue with the Ring Road. But first, a little deviation to Hallormsstadhaskogur,\
  \ one of the most important forest on the country. I did a little trek, enjoyed\
  \ the views, and the I found a little community with a farm and lunch for tourists.\
  \ Then I returned to route 1, for a long day of driving around the fjords of south\
  \ eats Iceland, with some breathtaking views, which made my driving even slower.\
  \ For dinner time I arrived to Hofn, and I wanted to continue to Jokulsarlon after\
  \ that, but the weather again had different plans: the constant and heavy rains\
  \ that affected the south of Iceland during the week ruined a bridge on route 1,\
  \ right after Jokulsarlon. The road will be closed until monday.  Not only I couldn't\
  \ finish the Ring Road and I'd miss the south of Iceland. I'll have to return in\
  \ 1 day, what I made in 3 days. \nI felt terrible. But I like to think that the\
  \ viking gods decided to gave me a little reward. That night, going back to my camping,\
  \ for the first time I saw the green lights dancing in the sky. I took my camera,\
  \ tripod,  my jacket, and a bottle of chocolate liquor reserved for that occasion,\
  \ and went up to a little hill to appreciate the show. I cried -yes, again- but\
  \ from happiness. \nThe next day I drove, and drove, and drove. And again I was\
  \ surprised for a few episodes of lights on the north west part of the island. I\
  \ parked the truck on the first site I could, put my camera and tripod on the roof\
  \ of the truck, and took my favorite picture ever. The icelandic skies can always\
  \ surprise, and amaze you."
