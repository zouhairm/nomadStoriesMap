Text: "I wasn\u2019t organised\u2026 at all. No hotel booked, no tours organised,\
  \ not even a trip from the airport planned.  I lugged my backpack off the airport\
  \ collection table and walked into the nearby coffee shop to escape the hustle and\
  \ bustle.  The crowds outside clamored to leave the confines of the building and\
  \ launch out into their next adventures.\nBut I wasn\u2019t sure what I would do.\
  \ In fact, I was a lot unsure.  I had been travelling for a month already so I knew\
  \ I would be okay once I got started.  I just needed a breather and the strength\
  \ to face the hordes of taxis and motorbikes, waiting to pounce the moment I stepped\
  \ outside. I wished I was a man, or least a taller or older girl so I didn\u2019\
  t look so vulnerable.  But I was neither\u2026 I was just me.  And I needed a few\
  \ minutes to plan some immediate steps in my head, then I\u2019d be fine.\nThe coffee\
  \ was muddy and gone too soon.  The crowds had died away, the caf\xE9 emptied and\
  \ yet still I baulked.  Then the empty coffee cup was collected, and I could feel\
  \ the tension of \u201CI hope you hurry up and leave soon so I can close the shop.\u201D\
  \  \nI shuffled through my hand scrawled notes and flicked aimlessly through a pamphlet\
  \ on the table.  Time was ticking. I couldn\u2019t stay here forever.  Through the\
  \ windows, I could see the taxi drivers lounging at the airport entry and leaning\
  \ on the bonnets of their cars.  They\u2019d obviously gotten used to long periods\
  \ of waiting in the tropical heat between irregular flights.  Then they seemed to\
  \ transform into competitive beasts when tourists appeared through the exit and\
  \ afterwards return to their local personas, laughing and joking amongst their work\
  \ colleagues.  \n\u201COk, it\u2019s easy.  I just need to get out there and choose\
  \ a taxi, any taxi\u2026 or a motor bike.  Then negotiate the fare.  But what\u2019\
  s the exchange rate again?\u201D Suddenly, my brain didn\u2019t want to compute.\
  \  \u201CCome on, this should be easy\u2026 Never mind, how about I pick a ball\
  \ park figure and see what they say?\u201D  The waitress shoots me a few daggers.\
  \  I\u2019ll need to move on soon. \n\u201CWhat about a hotel? I guess I could just\
  \ see where I end up.  I could just go into the middle of the city.  There\u2019\
  ll be something available there.  It\u2019s not like I\u2019m in a busy tourist\
  \ destination.\u201D In fact, the city of Phnom Penh had not long opened its borders\
  \ to tourists like me.  It was the early nineties and there was every chance that\
  \ there wasn\u2019t going to be many places to stay at all.  And the dirty, dilapidated\
  \ coin phone on the wall didn\u2019t seem like it was even working to contact a\
  \ hotel, even if I wanted to. \nIt was late afternoon so there wasn\u2019t any time\
  \ to organise travel north to Ankor, where I was headed.  I rose to leave, heaved\
  \ my backpack on my shoulders and slowly walked towards to exit.  The heat engulfed\
  \ me, and the perspiration beaded on my forehead as soon as I walked outside the\
  \ doors.  The drivers looked up, alerted by a new movement, and started to surge\
  \ forward. I steeled myself for the onslaught. It was time to do it. \nI straightened\
  \ myself up, scanned the crowd and quickly chose one of the motorbike riders.  Luckily,\
  \ I had worn shorts and not a skirt. I lumbered onto the moped behind the young\
  \ rider, who looked as if he had just won the lotto. \u201CPhnom Penh, Miss?\u201D\
  \  I nodded, relieved at having finally made a decision. \nI gripped onto his shirt\
  \ as he over-revved the bike\u2019s underpowered engine, ready to transport his\
  \ heavy load. He grabbed my hands and wrapped them around his slim waist. I would\
  \ need to hang on as I took the leap into the unknown."
