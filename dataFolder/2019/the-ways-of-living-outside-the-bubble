Text: "There\u2019s this moment in life when saying things like \u201Coh I can\u2019\
  t live without my hot chocolate in the morning\u201D doesn\u2019t make sense anymore\
  \ because you realize in order to truly experience your trip, you need to adapt\
  \ and for that you can\u2019t need anything.\n\nSince I can remember, I wanted to\
  \ go away. Don't know exactly why, maybe growing up in a country where violence\
  \ is part of reality, had fed my desire to escape. Also believe when you are a teen\
  \ it intensifies. I wasn\u2019t any different going to sleep every night dreaming\
  \ about getting on the first plane to the United States, but this never happened.\n\
  \nWhen I was seventeen, finishing high school and with my dreams of studying in\
  \ an American school like those in the movies crashed, my English course offered\
  \ to me and to the rest of the class a group experience to study abroad for one\
  \ month. Had my hopes back again.\n\nHowever, after a little research I found out\
  \ ways to spend less money studying abroad but for that I would need to go alone.\n\
  \nAfter a long speech to my parents about how responsible I was for a girl in my\
  \ age, everything set I was going to Canada alone for two months to study English.\n\
  \nHere is the thing, when you travel alone there's this whole \u201CI want to get\
  \ to know myself better\u201D vibe that everyone talks about. Yes, that might be\
  \ true. It's indeed a good opportunity to learn more about ourselves, but they don't\
  \ tell you that the only way to do that is through others.\nSo look carefully at\
  \ those to your surroundings, not just pass by them, listen to what they say, that\u2019\
  s where the best lessons are. I realize there\u2019s so much more to existence then\
  \ I once knew.\n\nPeople have so many beliefs, ways of living. And we limited ourselves\
  \ into thinking there\u2019s only a single way to do things.\n\nThe Family which\
  \ I was staying with was vegetarian so even the food and reasons why people chose\
  \ not to eat meat was a discovery for me. And Canada is also a multicultural place,\
  \ so I had classes with people from all over the world.\n\n\n\nI found out that\
  \ kissing in the cheek when greeting someone like we do in Brazil can be offensive\
  \ for other cultures and then I began to change, and broke the bubble I lived in.\
  \ When I got there, I was full of myself but learned to lose it all, let it go,\
  \ be a chameleon.\n\nI used to believe that in order to travel we need to earn a\
  \ lot of money and seeing people traveling from place to place working in exchange\
  \ for accommodations instead of obstacles I saw possibilities.\n\nI also thought\
  \ that happiness was something you reach when you complete the checklist of life\
  \ finish college, get a job, travel a little, get married, get a dog and a baby.\n\
  \nAnd end up figuring out happiness is a single moment that will sometimes last\
  \ just a few minutes, when you wish time will freeze. And that\u2019s why we appreciate\
  \ it so much because it will pass so quickly, and we will be left with the feeling\
  \ of wanting to go back.\n\nThe unknown for me was more than just finding out a\
  \ new culture, or that I can go a day without a hot chocolate in the morning, was\
  \ about looking at mundane things I\u2019ve always looked but seeing them differently,\
  \ questioning my on beliefs. Are they really mine or someone told me that I should\
  \ think that way and I never wonder about it?\n\nThat\u2019s when the unknown begins\
  \ when you start to ask questions. Is every road ahead of you simply a long dark\
  \ tunnel, why can\u2019t it be a beautiful night? Found out my answer just one step\
  \ outside the bubble."
