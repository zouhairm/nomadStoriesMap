Text: "I admire the beauty of my country, unique places and special destinations,\
  \ so every time I feel nervous or upset I know that time come for an adventure and\
  \ I take the chance to discover every spot in it.This time my choice was a place\
  \ which a heard about it a long time ago but I didn\u2019t had the chance to visit,\
  \ Zaghaoun a small place near the cost, rich and full of historical and archeological\
  \ places.\nI prepare my bag and my camera, thrilled and excited i headed towards\
  \ my destination.\nWhen I arrived there, the first thing I noticed was  fluffy white\
  \ clouds hovering around majestic mountains also the partition of colors was amazing\
  \ white on the top , gray and brown in the middle and green on the bottom . I had\
  \ followed signs to reach an Archaeological site sat down between the mountains.\
  \ A barber and abandon village \u201CZriba olia\u201D, a place where I thought that\
  \ time stopped for a moment, empty old houses, stairs in every direction and extended\
  \ walls.\nStep by step I started climbing the mountain next to the village, looking\
  \ for a camping site. I found a flat land on the top with an amazing view, artificial\
  \ lakes in every corner and if you focus enough you could see the Mediterranean\
  \ Sea.\nNext to my tent i sat down enjoying the sunset eating ships and chocolate,\
  \ then I started counting stars until I slept.\nThe next morning I started my day\
  \ taking pictures after that i went to visit the temple of water, where ruins and\
  \ sculptures reanimate ancient event.\nAfter a while I took a place under a olive\
  \ to rest, a man herding sheep comes close to me, he band over and with a wrapped\
  \ package in his hand hi smile and told \u201Cenjoy my son\u201D at the be begging\
  \ I didn\u2019t understand but when I open it I found a hot piece of meat, I raised\
  \ my head to thank him but he had disappeared. I couldn\u2019t resist the smell\
  \ so i took a fork from my bag and I swear that the taste was unbelievable, the\
  \ flavors and the texture just amazing.\nBeing free, curiosity and enjoying the\
  \ nature beauty are my triggers to continue traveling, wishing that someday I fulfill\
  \ my dream \u201Cdiscover every corner on this planet\u201D."
