Text: What an insane period of travelling have I had last year in Turkey!For the first
  time of my life I  became dabbling in spending some time abroad alone, inspired
  by freedom, the unknown and awe.  From then, adventure has become my second me which
  keeps me alive as taking a break from ordinary things and doings, through travelling,
  can rebirth a love. There are endless adventures around the corner from us. Being
  invited into houses and families and lives of locals during Erasmus+ project in
  Turkey, fulfilled the need to belong and at first - to myself. No matter where we
  happen to be, it's always about the people. Me? The place is only a container. To
  miss somebody is my heart's telling me there was/is a connection made, there was/is
  a meaning shared intimacy, a two-way effort. I will miss Turkish people because
  of the added value to my happiness and freedom, because those people helped me move
  forward and find myself in myself! I did not know I can take a plane and fly! I
  did not know I can speak English, understand and be understood! I did not know I
  can feel at home being far away from my real home, however- being with the best
  finding- myself! I have understood that travel does not change a person, travel
  challenges and a challenge is what changes a person! Let's take a step outside our
  comfort-made-zones and start to explore and start to live!
