Text: "20 years ago, I walked into a diner on the Sunset Strip in Los Angeles. It\
  \ was a crisp, autumn evening with neon lights running the length of the boulevard.\
  \ If L.A. had ever cared about seasons, the sidewalks would have been strewn with\
  \ freshly fallen leaves. But Hollywood is not a real place, so everything was 'just\
  \ so', palm trees standing tall, reaching into a cerulean blue field of endorphins.\
  \ At night, Sunset Boulevard transformed into a time-lapse parade of perfect smiles\
  \ on former prom kings and queens with aspirations of fame, fortune, and a lifetime\
  \ of cinematic orgasms. \n\nThis part of the strip presided over a clutch of nightclubs\
  \ where legends honed their craft in an endless search for that perfect chord. So\
  \ it was only fitting that I should walk into this particular diner -- Mel's Diner\
  \ -- with James Iha, the guitarist for The Smashing Pumpkins. I relished the stir\
  \ that this caused upon our entrance. As the hostess showed us to our table, all\
  \ of the attention was on James, but I basked and beamed in the reflected light\
  \ of a bonafide rock star. I wasn't a hanger-on, exactly, because I don't think\
  \ James had those kinds of relationships. He was a genuine dude. A deep thinker.\
  \ But I did have that -- less than admirable -- new-to-Hollywood pride at having\
  \ a famous friend. The feeling of validation. The feeling of being somebody. Fame\
  \ is infectious. And even good people turn into pricks in Hollywood when this sort\
  \ of thing occurs. La La Land is a machine with bastardized and monstrous gears\
  \ in perpetual motion, and if you come out of Hollywood the same person you entered\
  \ into it, you can count yourself lucky. Very lucky.\n\nWe sat down at our table\
  \ with all kinds of eyes on us. I pretended not to notice. I asked James something\
  \ I had been pondering for the several weeks we had been galavanting around town.\n\
  \n\"How did you end up becoming such a great guitarist?\" I asked him.\n\nJames\
  \ put down his menu and thought for a moment before he answered.\n\n\"When I was\
  \ in high school, I had a friend named Javier that played the guitar. Javier was\
  \ gifted beyond belief. People would go nuts while he played in the halls between\
  \ classes. It was almost as if he were the instrument -- not the guitar -- and God\
  \ was playing him. I watched him intensely. I studied his finger positions as they\
  \ moved from chord to chord effortlessly. I tried to crack the code that was his\
  \ essence. He knew many songs by rote and played them flawlessly, and with such\
  \ style. Even the most technically difficult pieces eminated from his guitar strings\
  \ without strain or sweat. It motivated me. I practiced every night for hours. For\
  \ a while, my fingers were in terrible shape, but I was driven to match his prowess.\
  \ I kept at it. Hundreds of hours turned into thousands. One night, a magical thought\
  \ appeared in my brain. I realized I would never, technically, be as good as Javier.\
  \ Even if I practiced ten hours a day, for the next ten years, it would never happen.\
  \ And it occurred to me that I didn't even want to be the best guitar player in\
  \ the world. I wanted to write the catchiest riffs. Not only did I realize this\
  \ was my true desire, I also realized that I was capable of it. So I concentrated\
  \ on creating melody and riffs. I shifted focus. And that's it...that's the answer\
  \ to your question. And, by the way, our drummer is many times better at his instrument\
  \ than I am at mine. He has an utterly shocking level of talent.\"\n\nI stared at\
  \ James, my mouth agape. Because I loved his story and I loved the way he told it.\
  \ \n\nListen to the song \"Today\" by The Smashing Pumpkins sometime soon. Listen\
  \ to the first 1.5 seconds of that song and you will understand what James was saying.\
  \ Almost anyone you know -- literally anyone -- can identify that song in 1.5 seconds\
  \ beyond a shadow of doubt.\n\nThe world needs more songs like \"Today.\"\n\nAnd\
  \ it always will."
