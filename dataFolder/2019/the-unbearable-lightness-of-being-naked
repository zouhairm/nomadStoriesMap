Text: "I stumbled upon Daphne on the dusky rooftop of a riad in Marrakech.\n\nThis\
  \ six-foot Canadian with man-sized feet was the only other guest there, and she\
  \ was naked. Or mostly naked, which is startling for me at the best of times, but\
  \ particularly in Morocco - a conservative north African Muslim country.\n\n\u201C\
  Oh, er, hello!\u201D\n\n\u201CHi,\u201D she said, blowing a plume of smoke and looking\
  \ up briefly from under a straw hat propped on top of a riotous pile of hemp-yellow\
  \ curls.\n\nShe wore the tiniest bikini bottoms and was bent over a fine piece of\
  \ silk, sweat glistening on her freckles, and rolling between her bronzed breasts,\
  \ as her fingers, blackened with henna, drew delicate brush strokes across the fabric.\
  \ \n\nEmbarrassed, I turned to leave, when she said, \u201CI hope you don\u2019\
  t mind. I love the sun and I need to work.\u201D\n\nDaphne wore her skin as comfortably\
  \ as a child, so I found I actually didn\u2019t mind (although I had to stop myself\
  \ from blurting out sun safety warnings). My daughter, who was three, thought this\
  \ was just grand and stripped to her panties. In the coming days, she\u2019d end\
  \ up bare-bottomed, riding Daphne\u2019s naked back in the pool while my red-faced\
  \ husband kept his eyes firmly on his laptop and pretended nonchalance as he groped\
  \ blindly for his mint tea.\n\nDaphne designed scarves and was based in Berlin,\
  \ but her spirit was as free as any Berber\u2019s. It was in Morocco that her creativity\
  \ really bloomed. She travelled alone and explored the souk and twisting back alleys\
  \ for fabric. She found a lean-muscled man in a whitewashed corner who devotedly\
  \ spun silk for her all day on an antique loom. \n\nAnother skinny man became her\
  \ driver, beaming in delight as Daphne hiked up her Berber robe, straddled his motorbike\
  \ and stuck out her Birkenstock feet like boat paddles before they roared off, helmetless,\
  \ into the midnight throb and throng of Djemaa El Fna square.\n\nDaphne did her\
  \ best to be modest. She really did. To ward off harassment or disapproval, she\
  \ stained the tips of each finger, to the first knuckle, black with henna to indicate\
  \ she was a married woman, which she was not. She always wore a black Berber robe\
  \ in public to cover as much of her lanky limbs as possible, but it turned out to\
  \ be a men\u2019s robe. She should have known, because it billowed around her tall\
  \ frame perfectly.\n\nYet, instead of unsolicited catcalls or mutterings, she somehow\
  \ drew admiration, chivalry and kindness. Men and women alike were almost protective\
  \ of her, as if she needed guarding from her unconsciously wild and trusting self.\
  \ When she was crippled by menstrual cramps, the ladies from the riad kitchen gathered\
  \ in her room like hens, clucking advice and handing her cups of cinnamon tea to\
  \ take with the Ibuprofen I\u2019d dispensed.\n\nNo, there was no way Daphne could\
  \ hide her light under a bushel. My own light, of course, was quite comfortable\
  \ under its bushel until Daphne began to fan its tiny flame.\n\n\u201CI\u2019m going\
  \ to a hammam,\u201D she said one afternoon when she found me lounging in the courtyard\
  \ with the riad\u2019s baby tortoise for company. \u201CCome with me.\u201D\n\n\
  It wasn\u2019t a question. I stuttered, thinking of a million reasons I couldn\u2019\
  t - my legs needed a shave, for one, and, two, I don\u2019t do publicly nudity.\
  \ Ever. I heard myself saying, \u201CSure!\u201D\n\nFor one glorious hour I learnt\
  \ to be naked, like a child, lying on my back on a warm, marble slab alongside Daphne\u2019\
  s Amazonian limbs, while an aya gently scrubbed, sloughed and soaped our skin, her\
  \ hands as tender as a mother\u2019s.\n\nAfterwards, we strolled, still naked, through\
  \ the hamman to take a dip in the cold water pool and cool off. A young, European\
  \ couple was waiting their turn on loungers. They looked away shyly. And we? We\
  \ just glowed and glowed.\n\n\nEverything about her was haram.\nHer lamp razed bushels\n\
  as fast as she tried to stamp\nthem out with feet as big as men\u2019s.\n\nShe set\
  \ my own lamp alight, \ndragging me out of myself \nand laying me bare \non warm\
  \ marble\nas if it were nothing."
