Text: "New Delhi, 2017: While serving sentence in my self-imprisonment, with existing\
  \ notions of character disorder lurking in my head. Diwali, the Hindu festival of\
  \ lights was fast approaching, and I needed to escape into something with both my\
  \ body and soul instead smoking myself to peace, like every now and then. \nMy shifting\
  \ religious adherence and pleasure for travel took no issue when my mind was fixed\
  \ on seeing His Holiness Dalai Lama who abodes at Dharmsala at the foothills of\
  \ Himalayas. With limited fund that I made by swindling and a half-tormented mind\
  \ full guilt I boarded my trip. My habit of taking the wrong choices had me take\
  \ some refreshments while the bus had its dinner halt. My body copied turns and\
  \ curves of the road as the air around me started to get thick and cold. I couldn\u2019\
  t sleep at all.\nIt was 3 AM In the foothills of Himalayas, I get down from the\
  \ bus with a seriously nasty sensation in the head combined with an urge to throw\
  \ up. My stay was around 9km up the mountains and with no chance of public transport\
  \ this early or an already exhausted me making the climb. As the last resort I hired\
  \ a cab that would take me two thirds of the journey. As karma I had to pay up a\
  \ loot for the service of the cab, but as if that wasn\u2019t enough, have to carry\
  \ on the rest of the trek. After exhausting my water and power, the possibility\
  \ of a collapse seemed imminent. Left with no option, I had to wash my face and\
  \ drink up water from a body of running water which only resembled a brook. By five\
  \ I reached the hostel and with little pleasantries slept on the terrace inside\
  \ a blanket that I carried.\nI don't know who all I hugged in my brief sleep but\
  \ the fur in my mouth suggested one of them was probably the hostel owner\u2019\
  s dog. After a late breakfast I joined up a party of trekkers going up hills. us\
  \ to an isolated waterfall where we spent time till noon. The return trek gave me\
  \ a glimpse of the sun crashing into the long Dhauladhar mountain range, so unexplored,\
  \ so beautiful.  \nI spent the next day seeing and learning about the little Tibet\
  \ in India and his holiness the Dalai lama of whom I was a very strong follower\
  \ of, despite being a Hindu. Museum of Tibetan culture and history, the exile of\
  \ His Holiness and the many self-immolators, a strong living memory of a peoples\
  \ struggle for freedom. My anxiety and curiosity grew fast paced as I went through\
  \ the monastery. The monks some as young as me, sitting so calm, paying no heeds\
  \ to the otherwise irritating tourists like myself. What gives them this peace,\
  \ god ? What makes them not think of a career, money or women. \nOn the final and\
  \ most awaited day of my trip I realized that his holiness is on the other side\
  \ of India giving teachings. I felt so void. While desperately trying to cheer myself\
  \ up at a Tibetan restaurant gulping down dumplings, I imagined the possibility\
  \ of ever making it back here again. Life\u2019s toll for a second chance is time,\
  \ will I have it? \nBefore leaving back to the urban heartland of India, I visited\
  \ the St. John in the Wilderness Church, which is the final resting place of James\
  \ Bruce, who was Governor-General & Viceroy of India in 1861 during the British\
  \ Raj. To think, over the years the people who came and made India their home, in\
  \ a land of paradoxes, from the Turks, British and among many now Tibetans.   \n\
  With a heavy heart I boarded my bus back to Delhi, to the city that functions in\
  \ anarchy, to be again put into the never-ending cycle. Limping across the bus to\
  \ my seat , I realized, I had forgotten about Buddha. So, I lit myself a smoke and\
  \ went to peace."
