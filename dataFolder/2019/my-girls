Text: "Never take it off they told me as the bracelet was wrapped around my wrist.\n\
  I haven\u2019t.\nIt doesn\u2019t set off metal detectors and I tell nurses to find\
  \ another vein \u2013 it\u2019s religiously significant.\nNo more bad luck they\
  \ said. That one didn\u2019t quite pan out but whenever I look at my left hand,\
  \ I remember My Girls. The same goes for my right but showing a finger that was\
  \ broken and not set properly doesn\u2019t have the same effect when you step off\
  \ the bus from Lao Cai.\nPea-soup fog and freezing temperature greets the few tourists\
  \ who were stupid or brave enough to visit Sapa in January. They scurry to their\
  \ lodgings as I pull the sleeve of my jacket up.\nYoung H\u2019mong girls who wait\
  \ for the bus in the pre-dawn chill don\u2019t try to sell me anything, I\u2019\
  ve shown my passport as it were. I produce a picture, three smiling faces above\
  \ embroidered jackets. They run at pace towards The Market. I grab a tout and get\
  \ a room. Sliding into bed after washing the train filth off me there is knocking\
  \ at the door.\nZa is one of My Girls, she rubbed Russian skin cream on my exposure\
  \ burn last time I was here, but it\u2019s her son Jean in the basket on her back\
  \ that reminds me she is a woman now. Five years is a long time and it would have\
  \ been rude not to bring gifts.\nI am told to dress and rushed to The Market so\
  \ her citrus can be guarded by her grandmother before we find Lily. Vu is guiding\
  \ tourists around the hills and isn\u2019t expected back for days. When I give Lily\
  \ her fruit, I remind her that she hand-fed me lychees when Za was attending to\
  \ the burns on my face.\nWithout a child, stall or tourist group to manage, Lily\
  \ takes me to play pool while Za does grown-up things. Sapa has many bars with pool\
  \ tables but My Girls have their favourites and I am roundly defeated in all of\
  \ them. News travels fast in small towns and it\u2019s not long before we\u2019\
  re tracked down. Not because my legend preceded me \u2013 I\u2019m the only foreigner\
  \ not hiding in a hotel.\nWhen Lily barks at her cousins and nieces for trying to\
  \ sell me trinkets, I remember three young teenage H\u2019mong girls berating a\
  \ Vietnamese man in the middle of the street. The local Vietnamese didn\u2019t intervene,\
  \ they knew the damage he could\u2019ve done to tourism if I hadn\u2019t survived.\n\
  Lily informs me my guide was sent back to Hanoi that evening before telling my tale\
  \ to the younger girls. They don\u2019t believe her, so I recall the time I was\
  \ abandoned descending Fansipan. It\u2019s easy to tell H\u2019mong the story; they\
  \ know how cold it is, which river I\u2019m talking about and roughly how far I\
  \ walked. Like most people they\u2019re impressed I could fall off a cliff yet only\
  \ break a finger and the jumping from ledge to ledge bit, but they shrug their shoulders\
  \ when I bring up the rat hunting hermits who fed me and pointed out the shortcut\
  \ to town.\nVu returns early from her trek due to the weather and we spend the rest\
  \ of the night drinking beer as she massages my finger. I tell her how effective\
  \ the opium she\u2019d rubbed on it after the fall was. She laughs at me as if I\u2019\
  m a child stating the obvious.\nZa knocks on my door. It\u2019s my last day. I fly\
  \ home from Hanoi tomorrow. She takes me to The Market where I sit with her grandmother\
  \ by the fire, eating mandarins and shaming tourists into paying a fair price for\
  \ the product. I don\u2019t think they expected to find a westerner with knowledge\
  \ of global exchange rates in the corner of a Vietnamese market (I\u2019m told I\
  \ don\u2019t look like a banker in Australia), but ten cents, is only ten cents.\n\
  I receive gifts from the stallholders with humility. The H\u2019mong are generous\
  \ people and it would be rude to refuse. My Girls see me off. Za wraps a bracelet\
  \ around my wrist.\nFor Good Luck this time."
