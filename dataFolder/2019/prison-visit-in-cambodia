Text: "There are pieces of my phone scattered all over Ho Chi Minh City. They take\
  \ it apart and sell the pieces, that's what I was told. I got it stolen just a few\
  \ hours after a New Years celebration by a guy on a motorbike. In a matter of seconds,\
  \ I felt completely cut off from my family on the other side of the world. At that\
  \ moment I thought I knew what feeling alone meant.\nJust about a week later, in\
  \ Phnom Penh, I was typing away on my new replacement phone, trying to explain to\
  \ my tuk-tuk driver Nick where I am. I have already gotten used to miscommunications\
  \ due to them usually not speaking English well and me not speaking their language\
  \ at all. After he finally spotted me, I picked up the bag with some food and toiletries\
  \ and climbed in the tuk-tuk. \u201CReady to go?\u201D \nJP prison is quite a ride\
  \ out of the city, hidden from everything and everyone. I was dropped off at the\
  \ gate where I had to show the guard my passport and explain to him what was I doing\
  \ here. I am visiting Yoshe Ann Taylor, a love-scam victim who was tricked into\
  \ smuggling drugs. Here she is, in the middle of Cambodia, with her children growing\
  \ up without her in Australia. She is facing more than 20 years in a Cambodian prison\
  \ where no one speaks her language.\nThe guard nodded and sent me on my way. There\
  \ was nothing but eerie silence and tall prison walls surrounding me. Everything\
  \ felt abandoned, except for a man sitting on a low wall. He introduced himself\
  \ and told me he got his tuk-tuk stolen and is now waiting for a policeman to talk\
  \ to. He pointed me in the right direction towards the prison entrance. I thanked\
  \ him and wished him good luck.\nThe guards were not keen on the idea of letting\
  \ me in to see her. It was Sunday after all. No visiting hours today. After some\
  \ talking, I accepted my defeat and started walking away, but remembered just in\
  \ time to ask them if I could at least drop off the bag with goods I brought for\
  \ her. Silence. Then, they started talking to each other. After a while, they hesitantly\
  \ decided to let me in. After leaving all my belongings outside I was led inside\
  \ and left to wait for a while.\nYoshe is a sweet woman. In one short hour we were\
  \ given together she was talking to me about her life and what led to the situation\
  \ she's in. She was telling me about how the prison is overcrowded, her not being\
  \ allowed outside a lot and getting no more than one visit a month. Tearing up,\
  \ she told me about feeling lonely and forgotten. After what felt like only a few\
  \ minutes, a guard came and informed us about our time being up. We said quick goodbyes\
  \ and I was on my way out.\nThe prison walls looked even blander when I was walking\
  \ out. I felt like I never knew what being alone meant. When I walked out of the\
  \ gates Nick was talking to his friends, still waiting. Absent-minded, I climbed\
  \ in the tuk-tuk. He started the engine and smiled cheerfully. \u201CReady to go?\u201D"
