Text: "Tears stream down the faces of the 2711 concrete slabs. It is raining in Berlin\
  \ and it's as though the Holocaust Memorial is designed to be viewed in this weather.\
  \ An unnamed superstition inside me whispers that it would be disrespectful to use\
  \ my umbrella here. I allow the drops to also stream down my face, as I reflect\
  \ on the fate of the murdered Jews of Europe. Memories of Auschwitz flash into my\
  \ mind, from my visit there 3 years ago: walls lined with black and white identification\
  \ photos of both the terrified and the unsuspecting, remnants of tiny dresses and\
  \ coats, a mountain of shoes\u2014 \n\nFootsteps. \n\nI am shocked back to the present,\
  \ by the sound of rapid footsteps. \n\nA couple playing catch and kiss\nTourists\
  \ with their selfie sticks\nWhile all I see is brokenness\nGot shivers down my spine\n\
  As she stands and smiles\nDo I look prettier than the dead?\nHer smile asks from\
  \ her tilted head\nNo dear, the dead are shining bright\n6 pointed stars in the\
  \ skies\nWhile the point you take aint right\n\nWho takes joyful selfies at holocaust\
  \ memorials or pays homage to mass genocide with lovers\u2019 folly? The memorial\
  \ itself has already made me ill at ease, but these actions make me queasy. Can\
  \ travelers really be this superficial and ignorant? I\u2019d expect not. The very\
  \ reasons I travel are born of curiosity and respect for the world and humanity\
  \ as a whole. I want to learn from cultures and people. I didn\u2019t expect to\
  \ find this. \n\nIn this moment I also don\u2019t expect that in the coming months\
  \ I am to learn of my own ignorance. That my first real life experience of Germany\
  \ will show me that I unconsciously packed some embarrassing preconceptions about\
  \ this country and its people. I am embarrassed to admit that, upon entering Germany,\
  \ I harboured a notion that most German people would be direct and cold. A post-war\
  \ hangover, unknowingly learnt at school. I\u2019ve never believed any subset of\
  \ people belong entirely to a homogeneous group. Since I was a child, I\u2019ve\
  \ always defended those unjustly judged. So I didn\u2019t expect to discover this\
  \ about myself. \n\nGrowing up in an Antipodean island nation, on the other side\
  \ of the earth to Europe, it\u2019s easy to adopt stereotypes simply as a product\
  \ of your education. When the topic in history class is WW2 and you\u2019re trying\
  \ to memorise all the different perspectives, you learn about Nazi Germany and it\
  \ becomes simplified to \u201Cthe Nazis\u201D or \u201Cthe Germans\u201D. The words\
  \ become almost synonymous. You do not consciously differentiate the two and, since\
  \ your interaction with German people is limited, you are unlikely to be forced\
  \ to. You are far removed, to the extent that the tragedies of history seem merely\
  \ stories in books. The people are characters, assigned \u201Cgoodies and baddies\u201D\
  \ qualities that help aid the narrative. \n\nWhen confronted with reality, you\u2019\
  re forced to see humans. In Germany, and throughout Europe, I came face-to-face\
  \ with the endless kindness, openness, and hospitality of German people. \u201C\
  For some lunch\u201D, the maternal-eyed lady from Frankfurt proffered, as she handed\
  \ over a 20 euro bill- a generous addition to our busking bag full of coins. \u201C\
  Who\u2019s coming with me tomorrow?\u201D, Bernd, a German traveler, asked the entire\
  \ hostel- eager that nobody would miss out on a day trip to the beach. \u201CCall\
  \ us any time, if you\u2019re in Frankfurt\u201D, Harold and Sabine offered, handing\
  \ over their number after only spending an hour together on a walking tour of Ljubljana.\
  \ \u201CProst!\u201D, a group of young men exclaim, handing me a beer as I sing\
  \ on the streets of Passau. \u201CSo great to see you\u201D, Marie welcomes me into\
  \ her Dusseldorf home after only one hour of conversation in Thessaloniki a few\
  \ months before. I was definitely no longer no longer dealing with characters from\
  \ history books, but humanity. Wanderlust forces us to observe ourselves, as we\
  \ observe others. \n\nAs I stand here judging others amidst a memorial to death,\
  \ I am about to embark on a death of my own. Death of ignorance. \n\nDanke sch\xF6\
  n, Germany. Yours remains my favourite (truly) beautiful language in which to say\u2026\
  . Thank you."
