Text: "I peered along the line of the reef wall and watched the retreating shapes\
  \ dwindle, become dim specks, and then vanish. The whole encounter took only a few\
  \ minutes but it was something I will never forget.\n\nOver the past six days I\
  \ had got to know every contour of the reef. The hollow where the octopus hunkered\
  \ and blended with rock and bleached coral. The overhangs under which lion fish\
  \ hovered in suspended animation. The round coral  formation that was  home to a\
  \ number of eels, a medusa head when in late afternoon they extended to feed.\n\n\
  Six days ago we should have boarded a flight to Britain. Whilst reassembling our\
  \ belongings, checking under the bed for stray shoes, we became aware of the images\
  \ of volcanoes on the wall mounted television. Adjusting the volume we learnt of\
  \ the volcanic ash cloud that had grounded flights across Europe.\n\nIf you are\
  \ to be stranded then there are worse places than a resort on the Egyptian Red Sea.\
  \ \nIn order to ensure everyone from our plane was together, we were moved to an\
  \ all inclusive resort. Diving was out of the question. This might be the day our\
  \ plane would arrive, flying and diving are dangerous bed fellows. Completely self\
  \ contained, away from any village or town, the only possibility of exploration\
  \ was in the water. \n\nSo the hotel reef became my world. The tide, winds and currents\
  \ traced distinct patterns. Early morning would see the octopus hunting, morays\
  \ snaking across the sea bed, lion fish on their last patrols. Mid morning the tide\
  \ was in and the water formed deeper, warm pools atop the reef. Brightly coloured\
  \ parrot and Picasso fish poured in to feed and luxuriate in these temporary lagoons.\
  \ The afternoon saw wind. The dangerous surges on top of the reef meant it was time\
  \ to snorkel the reef walls. A  jigsaw of vibrant coral reflected the sun using\
  \ a rainbow spectrum. Swarms of tiny green and orange fish jumped in and out of\
  \ intricate coral heads. Down below grouper plucked at the wall and blue spotted\
  \ rays flew above the sandy floor. Occasionally a turtle would visit.\n\nDay five\
  \ brought welcome news. The holiday rep had been told there was very little chance\
  \ of flying the next day so we were given the go ahead to arrange a diving trip.\
  \ Four of us planned to travel further up the coast.\n\nJust before midnight a letter\
  \ was slipped under the hotel door. A good news, bad news situation. We had finally\
  \ been given a flight time but it was tomorrow, no diving. I woke before dawn, there\
  \ was still time for one last snorkel. An orange glow lit the east as I stepped\
  \ out in wet suit and neoprene boots. The lawns were speckled with egrets and a\
  \ few song birds were welcoming the new day. Two gardeners were turning on sprinklers\
  \ which drew the egrets to the disturbed ground but no other guests.\n\nI swam across\
  \ the incline of the reef, spotting the octopus in one of its familiar bolt holes.\
  \ About ten minutes had passed when I found myself staring into the blue. I am not\
  \ sure why, perhaps it was just the habitual checking that all divers tend to do,\
  \ or perhaps I knew something was coming. Out of the blue emerged three shapes.\
  \ The pod of dolphins swam directly towards my goggle eyed face, then turned in\
  \ line with the reef. As I swam to catch up with them they veered and executed a\
  \ perfect semi circle, re-establishing their original trajectory just behind me.\
  \ For a few glorious seconds we were swimming in parallel. Their silver smooth bodies\
  \ moved effortlessly through the water next to mine. Aerodynamics meant that they\
  \ were soon ahead. I stopped and watched them disappear.\n\nI no longer cared that\
  \ I could not dive. I had swum with dolphins, not the dolphins of caged aquaria\
  \ or reserves, but dolphins who had chosen to honour me with their presence."
