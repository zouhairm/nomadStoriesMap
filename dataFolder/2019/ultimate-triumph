Text: "The pub\u2019s glass doors were condensed with fog and cerveza; my hand left\
  \ an imprint when I pushed them open. I walked toward the bar and a plate of tostones\
  \ appeared. The warm, steaming fried plantains glistened with oily specks of salt\
  \ and pepper. Crisp, creamy bites played with my tongue. As I sipped a cup of dark\
  \ caf\xE9 Americana, I was intrigued by an old man surrounded by expats and locals,\
  \ holding court. I made my way to his side and was introduced to 97-year old Se\xF1\
  or Luis Hess.\n\tHis face was a refugee\u2019s roadmap. The pockmarked roads from\
  \ lips to eyes pulsed with each word as he recounted his tale. \n\t\u201CThey say\
  \ I single-handedly cut the highway from Sos\xFAa to Puerto Plata, with nothing\
  \ but a machete. I was alone, but it was just a footpath. And if you saw her river-green\
  \ eyes and smelled the coconut oil on her mahogany skin, you would have done it,\
  \ too.\u201D  \n\tOver many glasses of rum, Luis told me how he found love, and\
  \ how he founded Sos\xFAa.\n\t\n\tIn 1938, thirty-one countries and dozens of international\
  \ organizations met to try to figure out what to do with hundreds of thousands of\
  \ Jews needing to flee Nazi persecution. In the end, many countries expressed sympathy,\
  \ but only one world leader offered the Jews refuge. Trujillo.\n        This violent\
  \ dictator who had three decades of horrendous violations of human rights, of oppression\
  \ and massacres, was the only one willing to provide safe harbor. The irony of this\
  \ twist of fate was that he agreed to bring Jews to the Dominican Republic in hopes\
  \ they would interbreed with the locals\u2014to lighten the blood lines. Trujillo\
  \ hired Luis, a Jew who had already fled Germany, to serve as his translator and\
  \ establish a Jewish community on this tropical island. The first Jews to arrive\
  \ included no single women. Trujillo had manipulated the visa process so he would\
  \ have only men arrive. Lonely men. To assure they would intermarry and pass their\
  \ genes to the local women\u2014the goal to exterminate the darker skin tones Trujillo\
  \ disdained. Jewish emigration ended in 1941, and at the final count, the DR was\
  \ only able to take in about 600 settlers. \n       Luis was the first settler,\
  \ and now part of a well-established Jewish community in this coastal town, where,\
  \ each Passover, hundreds of Dominicans gather for a community Seder. Elbow-high\
  \ in matzah meal, together they create an assembly line forming hundreds of matzah\
  \ balls. They grind the local bacalao to make gefilte fish. My interest piqued,\
  \ Luis suggested I go find Mr. Katz, another of the original refugees, one of only\
  \ a handful left who still lived here full-time, with his established car mechanic\
  \ business, and extended family. \n\tAs I walked through town, there was the constant\
  \ annoying buzz of the motocicletas, and the smell of gas fumes spewed from the\
  \ conchos and guaguas. I passed the original synagogue that had been turned into\
  \ a museum. The sign read:\n\n       \"Sos\xFAa, a community born of pain and nurtured\
  \ in love, must, in the final analysis, represent the ultimate triumph of life.\"\
  \n\n\tI entered a neighborhood that consisted mostly of small shacks of plain cement\
  \ blocks topped with zinc roofs, in classic DR style. The air was filled with the\
  \ mouth-watering aroma of arroz y frijoles. In one compound the house rose above\
  \ the others, with painted clapboards, a shingled roof intact, and a yard full of\
  \ children\u2019s toys. There was a garage\u2014a rare commodity in small Dominican\
  \ towns, never seen in the barrios\u2014and the driveway was full of vehicles in\
  \ different stages of repair. \n\tAs I approached, three young Dominican boys charged\
  \ toward me, heading from the direction of Colegio Luis Hess, school books in their\
  \ hands, backpacks swinging. One child almost knocked me over and immediately turned\
  \ back with a sincere, breathless \"lo siento.\" \n\tKicking their futbal back and\
  \ forth, they headed for home, past the colorful broken-down shacks. It could have\
  \ been any small town on any Caribbean island. They were wearing the familiar bright\
  \ yellow and navy school uniforms, laughing and teasing as they rushed by. Sweat\
  \ beaded on their coal-black skin. And on their heads, they wore yarmulkes."
