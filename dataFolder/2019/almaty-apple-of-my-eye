Text: "Landing. I am looking through the plane window and see majestic mountains covered\
  \ with heads of snow. Light fog hugs the city and can\u2019t see the top of skyscrapers.\n\
  \nI am almost shivering, way excited. Entering the airport, reading the titles,\
  \ hearing the language my grandmother talked me to. Started crying at the customs\
  \ when they asked what is the purpose of the visit. I came home. The home I have\
  \ never been to. My Motherland, I have been separated from you but I found my way.\
  \ The land of the great warriors, romantic nomads. The Great Steppe. \n\nThe story\
  \ of my family is full of dramatic events. My ancestors left Kazakhstan many years\
  \ ago and in 2016 I visited Almaty, Kazakhstan for the very first time in my life.\
  \ Strangely, I have never been before there but as soon as I stepped into the country\
  \ - I felt like I lived there all my life. \n\nSpeaking Kazakh to everyone was the\
  \ strange feeling, earlier I could only practice it with my family. This language\
  \ sounds like a song, beautiful. While we are driving to the hotel, I talk to the\
  \ taxi driver and absorb views greedily. Seeing blue and yellow flag waving makes\
  \ me almost cry again, but I hold myself. Suddenly the mountains appear in front\
  \ of me. I freeze for a few seconds, feels like they are calling me. The first thing\
  \ I will go to see will be the mountains, decided. \n\nI just cannot take my eyes\
  \ from the breathtaking scenery all the time I am on the way to Shymbulak mountain\
  \ resort. Half of the mountains are icy, with snow glittering in sunlight. The other\
  \ half is green and seems velvet, you want to touch it. At the top I see a man with\
  \ giant bird sitting on his hand. It is the golden eagle! The bird from the flag!\
  \ Back to the nomadic days, Kazakhs used to hunt with golden eagles, nowadays most\
  \ of hunters \"berkutchi\" live in Mongolia, keeping the art and secrets of falconry.\
  \ I ask the man whether I can hold the bird for a few seconds - so heavy! \n\nMountain\
  \ air explodes my lungs, I close my eyes and listen to the silence while I am on\
  \ the top. I think I found myself. Yes. Going from one depression to another, made\
  \ me insensitive in so many ways. But here I feel myself alive. I expected getting\
  \ to know the place, where the history of my people began. I got this and even more.\
  \ \n\nI ate food as delicious as my grandmother and mother cooked for me: beshbarmak,\
  \ kumis, lagman, pilaf. The bread just from the tandoori is something out of the\
  \ world. I chewed so many red crunchy juicy apples and understood why they call\
  \ Almaty apple city. Alma stands for apple from Kazakh language. And drank liters\
  \ of black milk tea. \n\nI rode the horse - first time ever - and I think I never\
  \ felt happier: wind was blowing through my hair, heady scent of the steppe and\
  \ the moment of absolute freedom. \n\nMy eyes witnessed the lake, changing its color\
  \ from emerald green to turquoise blue - Big Almaty Lake. The freshwater lake is\
  \ surrounded by mountains like the youngest sister by over-protecting brothers.\
  \ \nSpent night in the yurt - portable house of nomads. At night the stars are so\
  \ big and clear.\nBargained in local market - bazaar - like ancient merchants did,\
  \ crossing the Great Silk Ray. \nListened to street musicians, playing dombra -\
  \ national Kazakh stringed instrument. \nSeen night Almaty from Koktobe hill.\n\n\
  But the main treasure of Almaty are people I met: hospitable, friendly and kind.\
  \ Nobody said \"no\" to me, when I asked for help.  \n\nI am that nomad who travelled\
  \ around the world but returned home. \nI found my heart where I left it - in the\
  \ heart of Eurasia."
