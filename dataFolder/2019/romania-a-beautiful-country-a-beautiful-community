Text: "From a little corner in Northern Ireland to Romania; a country which I hear\
  \ little about, but a culture which negativite comments circulate. My travels to\
  \ Romania had one purpose only and that was to contribute to the building of a home\
  \ for a family in need, but after landing in this beautiful rural country, I was\
  \ intrigued to learn about the community that comprises this unique place that left\
  \ me feeling as though I had travelled back in time. From the horse-drawn carriages\
  \ to the collecting of water in buckets, I felt in like I was in a different world.\
  \ Far from the capital of Bucharest where typical tourist attractions lie, I was\
  \ situated in the rural countryside, where lush green trees, sunflower fields, and\
  \ brightly coloured houses were all around. \nI knew there was a distinct uniqueness\
  \ as soon as I landed in the airport which resembled a shack and had minimum security.\
  \ That feeling of being in a different realm hit in and continued as soon as ascended\
  \ the bus which transferred me, and my luggage in an attached trailer, to my accommodation.\
  \ The journey there was a memorable one as I passed many little quaint towns in\
  \ which cows and horses wandered the quiet roads as if they were vehicles. Up into\
  \ the hills, green lush surrounded me and I felt at ease at the wondrous views of\
  \ nature encapsulated me. As I previously felt, I was excited to begin what I was\
  \ there to do, however, after discovering the uniqueness of this beautiful yet quaint\
  \ country, I was intrigued to discover and explore more; including the inhabitants,\
  \ who I found to be lovely, welcoming and sincere souls, completely erasing the\
  \ prejudice, which is sadly  widespread, that most Romanians are \u2018gypsies\u2019\
  \ or \u2018crooks\u2019. \nMy first day on the worksite and I was surrounded by\
  \ the green hills which bordered the entirety of the area. The skies were blue,\
  \ the sun was shining, and as I played with the young children of the area and the\
  \ countless stray dogs, I got a sense of what Romania really is. It is a community\
  \ of bliss, despite its old fashioned ways and poverty, it is a quaint country which\
  \ beholds purely natural beauty and inhabits grateful, optimistic and carefree souls.\
  \ I truly felt at peace here and made real connections with the community, who were\
  \ both welcoming and sincere."
