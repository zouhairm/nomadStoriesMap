Text: "I arrived in London in 2016, the nicest city I ever been in, when I landed\
  \ I got stuck in the heathrow airport and I had no idea about what I gonna do to\
  \ go to the Hotel. Thinking about what I will do, someone crossed my way as he was\
  \ in rush his scarf felt down, i took the scarf and called him to take it back.\
  \ after taking the scarf, I took the opportunity to ask him about address, ,where\
  \ can I find that Hotel?\n\"Actually, I am heading close to that Hotel\" he said,\
  \ he dropped to the Hotel and he offered to show me the city in the following day\
  \ which i accepted, and we became close friends, I went to visit his family living\
  \ in another town called Evesham, They are really nice and consider me like their\
  \ family. I moved from the Hotel and sted at his flat, he has seen me as his son.\
  \ We talk every day, I gained an english Dad and friend, I consider an amazing and\
  \ priceless thing. \nTravelling makes you tell great stories, meet great people\
  \ through your path, give knowledge about cultures, languages, ect..\n\nI really\
  \ want to participate to that program, that will enable meet great people all over\
  \ the world. Thanks"
