Text: "Four months ago I set off on a voyage of discovery around the country that\
  \ has many mixed connotations associated to it. Some referring to it as an Apartheid\
  \ State whilst others advocate its beauty and its spirituality. Certainly this year\
  \ it has come into mass prominence with it being the host of the Eurovision Song\
  \ Contest. For me Israel always holds a special place in my heart due to my family\
  \ history and also my religion. However, I did want to explore it further and separate\
  \ the fact from the fiction. \nJerusalem was an eclectic mix of old and new. Its\
  \ beauty runs throughout the capital with it being one of the holiest sites for\
  \ Christians, Muslims and Jews. It was such a fascinating cit seeing all religions\
  \ living harmoniously side by side. The old city is divided into four quarters with\
  \ an Armenian, Christian, Jewish and Muslim one. The sheer fact that these quarters\
  \ exist in close proximity and harmoniously emphasise its uniqueness as a city.\
  \ It was overwhelming seeing many Jews on a Friday night walking directly passed\
  \ Muslims on their way to the Western Wall (Kotel). Similarly, on a Sunday morning\
  \ Muslims were walking past other areas to go to the Al-Aqsa Mosque. This hybrid\
  \ of religions, faith and personalities is truly special and worth a trip to Jerusalem\
  \ to view. \nI strongly urge people to explore for yourselves the true marvel of\
  \ this spectacular holy city. When you are there you feel like time eludes you and\
  \ you feel very close to natural surroundings and beauty. Although people do tend\
  \ to think of Jerusalem as closed it is actually a largely open city for all to\
  \ embrace. d \nOn looking back at my time in Israel I see it as a truly intriguing,\
  \ fascinating and overwhelming country. From the wonders of the North like the Golan\
  \ Heights to the beautiful snorkelling sea of the South in Eilat. Israel is a plethora\
  \ of different cultures, nationalities, cuisines and heritages. Overall I wouldn't\
  \ have it any other way and looking back at my time it was Jerusalem that held a\
  \ special light in my heart and one that I am dedicated to ensuring persists with\
  \ more visits."
