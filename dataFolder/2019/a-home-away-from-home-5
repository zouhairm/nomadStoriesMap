Text: "Laying in bed wide eyed and staring at the glow in the dark stars I placed\
  \ on my ceiling as a kid, wondering where this adventure will take me, mentally,\
  \ spiritually and even physically. I have no sense of direction so no clue where\
  \ exactly I would physically be in the next 48 hours. Six months pier I was sitting\
  \ in my bible class in Cannon Beach, Oregon asking my friend what she was going\
  \ to do next. She told me she was going to Israel.  Curiosity took over me and an\
  \ urge for adventure, I asked, How? There is this school, Calvary Chapel Bible College,\
  \ they have campuses all over the world. One of them is located in Golan Heights,\
  \ Israel. While you\u2019re there you have an opportunity to study and travel all\
  \ throughout Israel for three months. That summer I worked in the beach town and\
  \ saved for this trip of a lifetime instead of saving for a car like my parents\
  \ suggested. I was going to travel and I couldn't be any more sure of my decision\
  \ then that summer. My friend wasn\u2019t able to go, so I would go alone. Of course\
  \ I wouldn\u2019t really be alone, I was going to meet people there. But, there\
  \ could be a small chance that this whole thing could be a big hoax and I get kidnapped\
  \ and taken advantage of. But that was the least of my fears. I was laying in my\
  \ room staring at the stars, thinking only about the train ride. The plan was arriving\
  \ at the airport in Tel Aviv, Israel, go through a security check, fetch my sisters\
  \ large orange suitcase that she lended to me and drag around my broken carry on\
  \ bag, go to the train station, get a ticket, get on the train and make sure I get\
  \ off at Ako. With my sense of direction I was terrified I would get lost. Then\
  \ I would be lost, and alone far far far away from my home, my security, and my\
  \ feeling of safety. But I was far from alone. When I arrived I was a mess, I was\
  \ unsure and felt lost. But I started reaching out the the people around me. This\
  \ beautiful woman in her black and white  hijab told me to go left then right to\
  \ get to the train station. I arrived in the train station with people rushing by\
  \ ready to buy train tickets. Not being able to read hebrew, I saw this girl who\
  \ looked about my age who was in a Israeli army uniform buying a ticket. I asked\
  \ for her help and she was unbundently kind and willing to. We got my ticket and\
  \ she directed me to the downstairs where the train for Ako will leave. I went down\
  \ the escalators dropping my bags, and the same girl was there. She saw that I was\
  \ a mess, dropping my bags and noticed my distress. She grabbed my bags and put\
  \ them on the train for me. She ended up on the same train as me, and told me about\
  \ this app that would tell me when to get off. The alone feeling went away when\
  \ we started to talk, about her story and mine. When she left she asked the people\
  \ on the train around us if anyone was getting of at Ako. I got nervous once again\
  \ because none of them were, but that quickly went away because this woman with\
  \ curly hair said she would help me. She continued to make me feel at home while\
  \ speaking the language I understood. She told me that she was a flight attendant,\
  \ and about her travels. She showed me pictures which reminded me why I was there.\
  \ She gave me her number if I needed help for anything. When she left she asked\
  \ for the people to let me know when to get off, and they did. A man helped with\
  \ my suitcase and I made it to Ako! I was far away from home, feeling at home and\
  \ not alone because of a helping hand, a story, a kind person."
