Text: "With a lofty bounce, screech and roar of reverse thrust, we touch down on the\
  \ Mumbai tarmac. I peer out the window into the humid orange haze as I\u2019m sure\
  \ the wheels of our plane scuttled the improvised tin roofs of the sprawling village\
  \ that surrounds the airport. The spicy air desaturates colour and defuses contrast,\
  \ creating a monotone, moody landscape that\u2019s exotic and eerie. I see children\
  \ playing cricket in any open space amongst the chaos of tiny homes, pausing only\
  \ to wave at the jumbo jets rumbling over their heads.\n\nMy hotel is a grand building\
  \ of colonial style that stands proud and exuberant on a dusty, chaotic corner.\
  \ I head straight for the cool of the hotel bar. It\u2019s a dark, musty space furnished\
  \ with gaudy golden chandeliers and studded leather lounges that seem to drink your\
  \ soul. I sit drinking gin and tonics amongst the scent of old leather, incense,\
  \ fresh-cut lemons, peanuts and mould that grows psychedelically in dank corners,\
  \ fed by the Indian humidity. A cricket match flickers on a TV in the corner and\
  \ the quiet bar sporadically erupts as the staff celebrate another Indian wicket.\n\
  \nAfter just the right amount of gin, I stumble onto the dusty street and fall into\
  \ the chaos of colour, sound and charcoal-filled spicy air. I\u2019m part of the\
  \ thrum and melody of interweaving people pulsing as a single mass of bright sari-clad\
  \ bodies, swarming like goldfish in an unpredictable stream. \n\nSuddenly an auto\
  \ rickshaw swerves, almost toppling at my feet. The driver wipes his sweaty brow\
  \ and says \u201Cbar, cold beer?\u201D.  This is a winning pitch and I crawl into\
  \ the small rick, lurching off into the convulsing traffic.\n\nWe arrive and my\
  \ driver, Salim, cuts the engine. \u201COk, we go\u201D he says while holding the\
  \ rick as if to make sure it doesn\u2019t topple over as I get out. He leads me\
  \ to a small door with a large bouncer and I\u2019m now wondering if this was a\
  \ good idea. \n\nWe climb a dark, slender staircase and wind our way to a pulsing\
  \ light ahead. As we enter the bar, an Indian dance number hits us. It\u2019s like\
  \ a beautiful Bollywood movie. A band plays on stage as women sing and dance in\
  \ ornate saris while the audience make it \u2018rain\u2019 rupees on them, flicking\
  \ money up in to the air and letting it slowly spin and waft through the smoke-filled\
  \ room before reaching the floor where it\u2019s trod on by barefoot dancers in\
  \ golden toe rings and glittering ankle bracelets.\n\nSalim slaps my leg with vigour\
  \ and shouts \u201Cgood huh?\u201D. I pull out some fifty-rupee notes and try to\
  \ shower them with grace. Instead, my fat sweaty fingers stick to the paper notes\
  \ causing the whole wad to fly out of my hand and straight into the face of a dancer.\n\
  \nThey finish their song and a small man in a black vest and bow tie sweeps up all\
  \ the money with a giant broom before the next song starts. It all seems too comical\
  \ to be real. \n\nSuddenly, it all stops. The lights go out and staff hurriedly\
  \ grab our beers and cigarettes before disappearing into a back room. I look down\
  \ the staircase and see police coming up. Now I\u2019m thinking of \u2018Banged\
  \ up Abroad\u2019 and I\u2019ve just thrown my only potential bribe money into a\
  \ dancer\u2019s face. \n\nThe police go to a side room. The wall is glass so we\
  \ see them produce what looks like a notebook, and the bouncer puts money in it.\
  \ They have a brief conversation and the police leave. \n\nAs the door slams shut\
  \ behind them, the dancers re-appear as if nothing happened and the music pulsates\
  \ again. Our beer and cigarettes also appear back on our table exactly where they\
  \ were\u2026 Did this really just happen?\n\nWe stumble out the bar laughing and\
  \ I question Salim about the momentary \u2018shut-down\u2019. He wobbles his head\
  \ and says \u201Cno issues\u2026 All the time like this\u2026\u201D. We crawl into\
  \ his rick and Salim looks at me. \u201CWant to drive?\u201D. Despite the urge,\
  \ I decline. Enough excitement for my first eight hours in Mumbai. \u201CAnother\
  \ time Salim\u2026 another time\u201D."
