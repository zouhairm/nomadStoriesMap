Text: "Antarctica. \n\nDark. Abhorrent weather. Windstorms. Barren. Cold.  Empty.\n\
  \nIt had always held an appeal though. A final frontier of adventure, reserved for\
  \ the bravest or perhaps the stupidest. Never could I ever had imagined finding\
  \ myself in a windswept city in southern Patagonia, ticket in hand and contract\
  \ signed for a job I wasn't entirely qualified to do, waiting to board a simply\
  \ massive aircraft bound for the frozen continent. Everything about the experience\
  \ was new, and all my fear and worries suddenly took a backseat because it all just\
  \ felt like a dream anyway.\n\nNobody I had asked could quite describe what it was\
  \ like to get there for the first time and now I know why.\n\nImagine. Rows of jumpseats\
  \ in an old Russian military jet, a screen in the front displays the view from the\
  \ cockpit. \nA sea of bright cloud reveals itself to actually be a vast expanse\
  \ of snow and ice as a thin blue strip materialises in the middle. This is  clear\
  \ blue ice  thick and ancient,  and hard as tarmac, providing the only suitable\
  \ landing strip for thousands of kilometres around. \n80,000 tonnes of aircraft\
  \ touches down and and people clad in the loud colours of technical outerwear start\
  \ to jostle. \nSunscreen, goggles, fur, down, gloves.\n\nThe door to the plane is\
  \ opened and the frigid air stings noses and eyes as you disembark down a set of\
  \ steep aluminium steps. This place is new and ancient at the same time. Spectacular\
  \ mountains form an amphitheatre around the runway, their dramatic summits seemingly\
  \ low as the glacier on which you stand , thousands of metres thick, wraps around\
  \ and masks their true height. Like an iceberg in the ocean, the bulk of these peaks\
  \ remains unseen.\n\nA halo surrounds the sun, illuminating the frozen air, turning\
  \ ice particles into glitter.\nNothing prepares you for the feeling of blissful\
  \ insignificance. \nFear and doubt are gone, they don't matter in this place that\
  \ is bigger than anything you have known. It is an absolute privilege to be surrounded\
  \ by such abundant beauty and this is only the beginning.\n A motivation to absorb\
  \ as much of this place as possible fills you up. This continent will change you,\
  \ enrich you and grow you.\n\nBright. Clean. Pure. Calm. Inspiring. Alive. Maternal.\
  \ Home.\n\nAntarctica."
