Text: "April 2016, a month that changed my life. I was on a solo trip all the way\
  \ from New Delhi, India for a performing arts camp in Graz, Austria. After the week\
  \ long workshop, I planned to explore the country a little more and took a train\
  \ ride to Salzburg. After spending 2 days in Salzburg, I planned to head of to Zurich,\
  \ Switzerland. The day I was leaving, I found myself in a fix as I had a train to\
  \ catch in 3 hours and I had misplaced my suitcase key.With a big suitcase and a\
  \ heavy backpack, I spent an hour searching for the key. Apart from that, I learnt\
  \ from my father, that my grandfather wasn\u2019t keeping too well. This added an\
  \ additional stress and hence, I felt helpless and miserable.\n\nWhile all this\
  \ was happening, I found a cafe very close to the main Salzburg Hauptbahnhof and\
  \ decided to eat something before I took the train. I entered to a vibrant little\
  \ space with photographs all over the walls. Most of the photographs were of people\
  \ of different age groups and candid shots of happy smiles. I was quite intrigued\
  \ and felt positive as soon as I made myself comfortable. The cafe wasn\u2019t quite\
  \ full so an old gentleman made his way to take my order. I ordered my food and\
  \ complemented him for the aesthetics of the cafe. He was quite charming and made\
  \ a conversation in return. He asked where I was from, how did I like Salzburg and\
  \ so on. While talking to him, my eyes went to a cute little photo frame that was\
  \ kept right in front of me. I made my way to pick it up and ask uncle Rob about\
  \ who was the person in it. As soon as I asked him who he was, Uncle Rob kept quite\
  \ and just smiled.\n\nAt first I found it a little absurd and didn\u2019t ask further.\
  \ He got me my sandwich and milkshake and I had a great time before I left for Zurich.\
  \ On my way out of the cafe, I looked back to a poster stuck behind the door. I\
  \ knew how to read German so it was easy for me to translate. After reading it,\
  \ My eyes went numb and I couldn\u2019t move for a bit.\n\nThe poster said, \u2018\
  \ Today is my grandson\u2019s birthday so leave a message for him on the box kept\
  \ on your left. Up there in heaven, he will get your blessings.\u2019 Given below\
  \ was a picture. A picture I had seen a couple of minutes back on the photo frame\
  \ kept in front of me. \n\nI couldn\u2019t leave. I had to know how this happened.\
  \ I turned back and found a lady mopping the floor. I went to her and asked how\
  \ this had happened. She then sat with me and told how Uncle Rob lost his son, daughter\
  \ -in- law and grandson, Russel in a car accident 3 weeks back. \n\n\nI couldn\u2019\
  t control my tears and ran out of the cafe. That\u2019s when something struck me.\
  \ I heard a voice within. It said, cribbing over small problems will get you nowhere.\
  \ There are people in this world, whose problems are endless but they still stand\
  \ strong and smiling, because life has to go on.\n\nI went back, and wrote a letter\
  \ to uncle rob with my email ID on it and told the lady to pass it to him. I then\
  \ made my way to the railway station, and called my family to let them know how\
  \ much I miss them and how I thankful I was for everything."
