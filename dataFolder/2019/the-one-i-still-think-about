Text: "The one I still think about is someone I may never meet again but I think again\
  \ and again...\n\nI had been speaking to a beautiful small petit lady before I left\
  \ from England. Now this sounds all desperate, but really, I was enhancing the visit\
  \ to my real friend in my life. I was building a local connection already and I\
  \ hadn't even touched my feet on the Filipino land! Little did I know I was to be\
  \ shown places even my friend hadn't seen from living there temporarily. \n\nShe\
  \ was asking intelligent questions about me and why I wanted to visit. She also\
  \ said:\n\n\"Why are you coming here? \"To which I replied \"I'm coming to meet\
  \ you!\"\n\nA person who has many questions before they meet someone is intelligent\
  \ and also gifted in life experiences. More questions again and again. I'm not committed\
  \ to too many questions but I had a good feeling and replied again and again.\n\n\
  In the general sense of things I was there to meet anyone who I can treat like I\
  \ would like to be treated. In figures, I had 500 matches and roughly 100 conversations\
  \ which went nowhere apart from Mara's. How wonderful to have 1 persons full attention\
  \ than 100's of semi-attentive people in your life...\n\nOur first meet was the\
  \ perfect click over and over again.\n\nThe first day which I thought would just\
  \ be a nice walk around an old Spanish fort area called \"Intramuros\" by Manila's\
  \ Pasig river turned into a full blown holiday romance for a week. It is very safe\
  \ to agree that a local connection was very successful. This doesn't always happen\
  \ in such a short period of time but our personalities matched as we kept in touch\
  \ she's the one I still think about over and over again.\n\nIntramuros' Spanish\
  \ history and architecture was painting the real picture of the Philippines. A grid\
  \ like compound with local cooking overshadowed by Western fast foods and Churches.\
  \ It was total ecstasy as I believe I have a keen eye for maps and I didn't even\
  \ locate a Spanish fort in central Manila.\n\nDue to the success of our day we invited\
  \ her friend out with my friend to the nightly live music bar in Makati. To our\
  \ disbelief both girls got up and sung for us on stage. \"Evanescence - Bring me\
  \ to life\" was definitely making my heart beat faster for this girl. This song\
  \ has real POWER to enhance a mind as long as you are willing to tap into your emotions\
  \ without fear of reprisal. We danced the night away after.\n \nOver and over again\
  \ I tell myself that I never really get experiences like this in England which makes\
  \ me think whether I actually enjoy England or whether I should travel around the\
  \ world and find where fits me! The words BRING ME TO LIFE are on my mind again\
  \ and again....\n\nA day or two later Mara and I ended up in Venice... Venice in\
  \ Manila that is. Overshadowed by tower blocks with fresh brand new Hollywood movie\
  \ type looking buildings which are safe from drowning. It was mildly amusing to\
  \ say the least. I have been to the real Venice so I wasn't pretending to be impressed,\
  \ but it was romantic and another great thing having a local connection because\
  \ I didn't see this on the map either....\n\nTo conclude this adventure which only\
  \ lasted 9 days in the city Manila. That feeling of being sent off at the airport\
  \ by Mara was really hard, harder than leaving my best friend to be honest, but\
  \ life is all about feeling things and experiencing things whether you have to endure\
  \ pain or happiness from it again and again."
