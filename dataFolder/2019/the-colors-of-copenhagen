Text: "Few weeks before new years eve, i broke up with my ex boyfriend.\nWe had many\
  \ plans for this holidays, most of them to stay in the northern part of Italy and\
  \ go to some ski resort there.\n\nBut everything changed in the moment , so i had\
  \ to recalculate my plans. I didn't want to stay alone in the center of Milan, although\
  \ it's a big city that always had traffic with things to do but suddenly this place\
  \ seemed a bit empty and lonely to me.\n\nA few days later, as someone had heard\
  \ my thoughts, i received a phone call from a good friend, he booked a ticket to\
  \ Copenhagen, he was wondering if i want to join him. \nTurns out that also a good\
  \ friend of mine Isabella, who is originaly of Denmark, planned to spend the New\
  \ Year there. \nTo tell the true ...i wasn't was enthusiastic about the idea, because\
  \ I never planned to visit this cold contry and i didn't know to much about this\
  \ place.\n\nSince I define myself as a spontaneous person, I decided to join to\
  \ my dear friends, and in less than an hour I already had a plane ticket and hostel\
  \ to stay in.\n\nAfter one week, im on my way to an known...\nWhen I got to the\
  \ city Copenaghen, it was late, around 23:00...tired and dreaming about my beauty\
  \ sleep, Isabella met me and took me on a night tour(fun fun fun!) in the city.\
  \ \nBut this tour didnt last for to long because we reached \"Christiania\". \n\
  I had no idea what the story was behind this city (they say it's a city but it looks\
  \ more like a neighborhood). \nWell at home when I did a little resurch of the recommended\
  \ places, \"Christiana\" was among the first sites to visit. \nBut it was under\
  \ the title \"City of Hippies\" or \"Freetown Christiania\". \nWell, almost all\
  \ the streets were dark,so it was almost impossible to see something,\nAfter a while\
  \ we reached a central bar that was open.\n\nThe smells in the place were very strong,\
  \ I understood straight where we were and why the city calls \"Freetown\".\nTtw,\
  \ they had a really tasty juice, sweet and made of some fruit. \nToo bad I was too\
  \ tired to remember the name, but i remember exactly how long it took to reach her\
  \ parents place.\n\nThe day after we met our other friend Aviv , and we went to\
  \ our hostel \"Copenhagen Backpackers\" right next to Copenhagen Central Station.\n\
  Honesty in the beginning i was not to much high up about to stay in the hostel ,\
  \ because of 2 reasons: first, i saw to many scary movies that calls \"hostel\"\
  .\nSecond , it was my first time so i didnt know what to expect for.\nBut i had\
  \ 2 good reasons to try it : first , I wanted to meet new people and second it was\
  \ a cheap option for this period ( i was a broken student).\nThe place was very\
  \ cosy and homey with a good design touch of inviting place.\nBut the sun outside\
  \ was much more welcoming so i had to go outside and enjoy of what this city has\
  \ to offer .\n\nIf you want to hear the rest of the story or see me writing about\
  \ new places, I'd love to have the opportunity to write about one of your trips.\n\
  \nBest regards,\nAnastassia Bol."
