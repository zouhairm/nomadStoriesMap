Text: "What a perfect title for the story I am about to tell you. In 2014 after graduating\
  \ from University, I was eager to start working in a field I am passionate about,\
  \ International Cooperation. \nI searched for a job in several international organizations\
  \ worldwide and unexpectedly ran into a job opportunity in Trinidad and Tobago.\n\
  First of all, I did not know where Trinidad and Tobago was nor did I know anything\
  \ about its culture, language or what to expect. Nevertheless, I enthusiastically\
  \ accepted the offer and made arrangements to reach the country.\nStarting from\
  \ the arrival at the airport, the hustle to find accommodation, beginning a new\
  \ job, making new friends and even falling in love, Trinidad and Tobago was keeping\
  \ me many surprises.\nI arrived in Port of Spain roughly two days prior to my first\
  \ day of work. I had little to no-time to settle in and find my landmarks. However,\
  \ within the first few days I met several people from all over the world who, just\
  \ as me, landed in T&T by a series of coincidental events and little by little started\
  \ exploring the country and its hidden gems.\nTrinidad and Tobago is a twin-island\
  \ nation in the Caribbean at the bottom of the Antillean chain. A young country\
  \ that became independent from the British in 1962. Trinidad has a petro-economy\
  \ which has fostered the industrialization of the country, and principally of the\
  \ capital Port of Spain. Tobago is a smaller island, what we usually think of when\
  \ evoking the Caribbean.\nI discovered how multicultural the country was. Strolling\
  \ through the streets of downtown I could realize I was in a true melting-pot nation.\
  \ People from all ethnicities, Indian, Chinese, Syrian, African, European and Latin\
  \ gathered in the same place; smells of spices, fresh fruits, fried chicken, tailpipe\
  \ emissions and raucous cars playing soca music fusion to  awaken my curiosity.\
  \ \nThroughout the days that suddenly became months, I was delighting myself with\
  \ roti, doubles, callaloo, curry, chow, bake and shark, crab and dumpling, corn\
  \ soup, pholourie, provision and other delicacies. I was \u201Climing in the Avenue\u201D\
  , wining to soca songs and spending my weekends at Maracas Beach.  In other words,\
  \ I was becoming as locals say \u201Ca trini to the bone\u201D.\nLater on, we slowly\
  \ approached the magnanimous T&T event, Carnival. It usually starts after Christmas\
  \ and just before Ash Wednesday. It is true that Trinis live and long for Carnival,\
  \ it is so embedded in their culture that it seems like everything revolves around\
  \ it. The famous \u201Cf\xEAtes\u201D are the starter\u2019s flag of this annual\
  \ celebration. J\u2019Ouvert is the official opener of Carnival, the parade starts\
  \ at dawn and you can expect to dance to the latest soca songs while getting splashed\
  \ with mud, paint, grease and whatever else people have in their hands until the\
  \ sunrise.\nOnce the sun is out, you better shower very quickly and get ready to\
  \ \u201Chit the road\u201D. Masqueraders fit in their costumes and the party goes\
  \ on until Wednesday morning when Carnival ends and \u201Ctabanca\u201D takes over\
  \ the people. \nTrinidad and Tobago alongside with its cultural richness, explosions\
  \ of diverse musical forms, religions, architectural jewels and traditions was definitely\
  \ unknown to me but at the end that leap into the unknown will remain one of the\
  \ most wonderful experiences I ever lived."
