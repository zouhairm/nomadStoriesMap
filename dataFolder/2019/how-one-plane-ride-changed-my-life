Text: "No matter how many times I fly, there\u2019s always a distinct anxiety that\
  \ comes with boarding every flight. But this flight in particular brought out a\
  \ new set of emotions. I was boarding a plane to New Zealand where I would be teaching\
  \ indefinitely. At 23 years old I was leaving behind everything, and everyone I\
  \ knew. \nAs I boarded the plane, fighting back tears,  I found my seat and felt\
  \ the knot in my throat begin to tighten. Then I noticed a brightly dressed woman\
  \ bobbing down the aisle, ticket in hand, scanning the seat numbers with her eyes.\
  \ She stopped in front of my seat and smiled. She plopped herself down in the seat\
  \ next to me and the knot in my throat began to losen. We had brief introductions.\
  \ She told me that her name was Althea and that although she was raised in Fiji,\
  \ she\u2019s been living in the United States for the past 20 years. I asked her\
  \ how old she was when she moved. She told me that she was 23, and that she had\
  \ moved across the world by herself. I laughed as I told her about my situation,\
  \ the knot slowly forming again. Upon hearing this she grabbed my hand and gave\
  \ it a tight squeeze. We sat like that for the rest of our 12 hour flight. \nBy\
  \ the end of the flight, Althea and I had become true friends. We shared our fears\
  \ and dreams, our thoughts on the world. We talked about our families, and friends,\
  \ and she jokingly talked about how much I would like her son. Once we landed, she\
  \ let go of my hand, looked me in the eyes and gave me some words of advice. The\
  \ knot was gone, completely undone. \nWe stayed in contact while I was teaching\
  \ in New Zealand. Our friendship flourished even 8,000 miles, and 20 years apart.\
  \ As I neared the end of my teaching contract in New Zealand, I began planning a\
  \ trip to Fiji on my way back to the States. I messaged Althea about suggestions,\
  \ and she insisted that I stay with her family in their village. She put me in contact\
  \ with her son who had taken off a week of work to show me around. This level of\
  \ kindness was not something that I was remotely used to. \nArriving in Fiji I was\
  \ a bit skeptical. I knew very little about the man that would be showing me around,\
  \ and everyone seemed unnervingly friendly. But my fears ended up being wrong. My\
  \ time in Fiji was undoubtedly the most amazing week of my life. Althea was right,\
  \ I did like her son very much. He took me on adventures that made me feel like\
  \ I was living in a cheesy, \u201Csoul searcher\u201D movie. One day we took a sailboat\
  \ to a deserted island where we swam with small sharks and sting rays. We woke up\
  \ every morning and walked to the village\u2019s plantation where he climbed coconut\
  \ and mango trees to collect fruit for us for breakfast. We swam on empty world-class\
  \ beaches everyday at sunset and climbed over sandunes in the dark to get back to\
  \ the village. \nDuring my time in the village, I became as close with Althea\u2019\
  s family as I was with her. We played games, and drank kava. We told stories and\
  \ watched rugby... so much rugby. When the day came for me to leave, they held a\
  \ Lavo (a Fijian feast) in my honor and told me to consider them my Fijian family.\
  \ \nAs checked into my flight to go back home, I felt the familiar knot forming\
  \ in my throat. But this time was different. I was different. This time there was\
  \ no kind woman to hold my hand, instead there was a whole village waving goodbye\
  \ from the gate."
