Text: "With all the elements of the beef burger assembled I carefully wrap it in a\
  \ napkin, stow it safely in my bag and exit the hotel restaurant. Nobody follows\
  \ me as I make my way down the path and past the swimming pool with my contraband\
  \ goods under a dark, Caribbean sky. \n\nI make it past the perimeter of the hotel\
  \ and my feet sink into powdery sand as I call out, \u201CMedina?\u201D \n\nA beaming\
  \ face greets me out of the dark, \u201CHello, my friend\u201D Medina says softly,\
  \ resting his shotgun against a palm tree and looking at me expectantly.\nI reach\
  \ into my handbag and pull out the incriminating beef burger; the smell of fried\
  \ meat would linger in my bag long after this holiday was over. Medina unwrapped\
  \ the food much more carefully than was required and sank his teeth into it with\
  \ a look of happiness on his face.\n\nA week previously my family and I had landed\
  \ in the Dominican Republic for a once-in-a-lifetime holiday. It was five-star,\
  \ all-inclusive luxury\u2026as long as you didn\u2019t look too closely. Lying on\
  \ the beach one day we noticed the hotel security guards sneaking around the palm\
  \ trees; we realised they\u2019d hidden bottles of water in the sand around the\
  \ base of the trees and were taking swigs when they thought no one was looking.\
  \ Their drinks didn\u2019t look very refreshing after being out in the sun all day\
  \ so we brought them new ones which they were quick to hide from view.\n\n\u201C\
  We\u2019re not allowed to be seen drinking\u201D they informed us.\n\nIt was then\
  \ that my family and I became food mules for the security guards. During the day\
  \ we\u2019d sneak them cold drinks and at night we\u2019d bring them food from the\
  \ hotel restaurant, a significant upgrade from the days-old leftovers they were\
  \ supplied with for lunch which would often leave them unwell. They\u2019d tell\
  \ us about themselves and they\u2019d ask us questions about life in England. A\
  \ life much different to their own. One of the guards in particular spoke good English\
  \ and he was keen to practice. We learnt that Medina was from Samana, a village\
  \ 215km away from the resort in Puerto Plata where we were staying and that he had\
  \ a young daughter but didn\u2019t get to see her very often because of his job.\n\
  \n\u201CI\u2019d like to show you my village\u201D, he informed us one day. Perhaps\
  \ the Caribbean sun had got to us, but we agreed to let this foreign stranger take\
  \ us to see his home.\n\n After a sticky and dangerously overcrowded four-hour minibus\
  \ journey where we became very good friends with the other passengers (mum had the\
  \ wonderful luck of being sat on a stranger\u2019s lap for the duration) we arrived\
  \ in Samana. Medina showed us his house first. We ducked under a line of washing\
  \ to see a tropical blue fa\xE7ade, the fading, yellow wooden door gave way to a\
  \ small room compartmentalised by lace curtains. Each section served as a different\
  \ room; it was compact but functional. Medina couldn\u2019t contain his excitement\
  \ as he showed us his new fridge; an item he\u2019d been saving up a long time to\
  \ buy. He pulled out bottles of soft drinks to show us how cold they were, a luxury\
  \ for him and his family and a necessity too, considering the sweltering heat that\
  \ was pulsing through the hut.\n\nAfter a tour of his home, Medina introduced us\
  \ to his family. We could only communicate through Medina acting as translator but\
  \ we felt welcomed by their smiles and gestures. They sat us on white plastic chairs\
  \ and gave us plates of rice and meat which we ate on our laps whilst chickens and\
  \ pigs strolled lazily around our legs picking up anything we dropped. There were\
  \ no fancy tablecloths, flowing wine or ma\xEEtre d\u2019s, but was it luxury? Maybe\
  \ the real luxury was in building a friendship that would last long after we left\
  \ the Caribbean, maybe it was in the memories of a cultural experience that couldn\u2019\
  t be bought and just maybe it was in the smile of someone as you handed them nothing\
  \ but a burger."
