Text: After leaving his house a guy with just 16 years old threw himself into an adventure.
  He traveled to another country where he met people he never thought he would. This
  story talks more about opportunities and learnings than any touristic aspect. It
  is about how this guy figured it out the meaning of home being away from it and
  understood the meaning of Family being surrounded by strangers. It goes beyond any
  physical experience. This story talks about problems, about struggling about falling.
  The story is about being homesick, depressed. I want to share my story because I
  want the people that are outside there to know that is normal going thru this. I
  want them to know that they are not alone. That they do not have to frustrate themselves
  because they are feeling something like that. I want them to no give up. My story
  won't talk all about perfection.  It going to be focused on how you can find yourself.
  Find the meaning of your life. Redefine the terms that we learned as a child. It
  is about how to be fearless. How to see yourself as a sufficient being. I want this
  story to be the words that I needed to hear when I was in these situations.
