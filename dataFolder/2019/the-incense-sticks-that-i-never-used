Text: "My first trip alone on my first salary from my first job had it all - nervousness,\
  \ getting over it, being open, traveling alone, no Internet, fresh air, new places,\
  \ experiences and also becoming friends with a stranger (and myself)! It was a little\
  \ over a month after my 22nd birthday. After years of always having people around,\
  \ I wanted to give myself a long awaited gift; a trip by myself. Living away from\
  \ home in Bangalore, I was on a budget. So I decided to take a weekend trip to Pondicherry.\
  \ Soon, I had purchased a bus ticket from and back to Bangalore for Rs.1600, booked\
  \ a guest house at Auroville for Rs.500 a night, inclusive of breakfast and dinner.\
  \ I gave myself an allowance of Rs.1500 to spend while I was there. With only that\
  \ much of a plan, I leapt into the unknown. I left on a Friday night. I arrived\
  \ next morning by about 8AM. Auroville is farther away from the main bus stand.\
  \ In 2011, there was no Uber to get me an easy ride. So after some haggling, I found\
  \ myself an auto rickshaw that settled for a bargain price of Rs.200. \n\nGoogle\
  \ map was not an option to get directions to the guest house because I didn\u2019\
  t have a smart phone. A phone call to the guest house was sufficient. Pondicherry\
  \ didn\u2019t seem too different from Chennai, my home city. I was uncertain about\
  \ my decision to travel to Pondicherry. But the gates to another world opened as\
  \ I entered Auroville. Greenery stretched as far as my eyes could see. Life was\
  \ visibly in a different order there. I began feeling grateful about my decision.\
  \ My first stop was at the Auroville cafe for breakfast.\n\nIt is a self-service\
  \ restaurant. The guests have to both collect the food and also leave the plates\
  \ back after finishing their meal. I was pleased by the sense of self-worth that\
  \ the workers there had; no ill-treatment like the other places in the Indian hospitality\
  \ industry. I then took an auto-rickshaw to my next stop, Aurobindo Ashram. I spent\
  \ some time in meditation and then visited their store. I wanted to buy myself something\
  \ but something cheap. So I bought myself a pack of incense sticks. I don\u2019\
  t remember ever using them. \n\nWith no laptop or Internet, I had time in hand.\
  \ So I began walking in the French part of Pondicherry to simply experience its\
  \ distinct colonial architecture. I walked into a cafe for a delicious but overpriced\
  \ lunch. I was still getting over the nervousness of being alone in a new city.\
  \ Being close to the Promenade beach, I decided to walk to the beach in the scorching\
  \ heat of the afternoon sun. I sat there watching the sea. An hour later, I headed\
  \ back to Auroville. Going back, I sat on one of the benches at the guest house,\
  \ reading the only book that I had carried with me. I\u2019m no book lover but desperate\
  \ times call for desperate measures! Finishing dinner, I decided to call it a night.\
  \ Next morning, after breakfast, I headed over to another cafe in Auroville. I was\
  \ finally getting used to being by myself. Sitting there, I did my favourite thing,\
  \ writing. I penned down a poem. Next up, I walked into another restaurant. I sat\
  \ at one of the tables in the lawn to have lunch. Sitting at the next table was\
  \ a gentleman in his sixties. He began a  conversation with me. I learnt that he\
  \ was Edwin, a Belgian living at Auroville. Our long conversation about his life\
  \ in the Auroville community eventually took a pitstop at his place for a coffee.\
  \ At about 7pm, I left to the bus stand, got dinner and took my bus back to Bangalore.\
  \ That Sunday night seated on the bus, it all came back to me. I definitely hadn\u2019\
  t see too many places in Pondicherry as I had hoped for. But I had unlocked the\
  \ unknown. I had finally travelled alone with no Internet and experienced a slice\
  \ of life (and definitely a lot of good food), at the Auroville!"
