Text: Mom always said, Darling! Every day is a new day and every beginning is by our
  side so make it worth living. I always thought this phrase is lame but slowly as
  the leaves  gets shedding and changing, I woke realizing that life is a journey
  and every day I exclaimed oh! Will i ever see this world the same?. My travel diary
  started the day I joined for my Master's degree in social work. My life completely
  change, I slowly begin to see the changes that were taking place before my eyes.
  Walking conundrum I was searching for a new beginning. I was born in a small and
  beautiful state of India called Nagaland. Nagaland a place with beautiful sunsets
  and hills. The place where you find the sweetest fruits, the freshest vegetables
  and the most delicious rice. Nagaland a place with the people wearing the most colorful
  dresses and a place with  beautiful bamboos and flowers around you. The place where
  many cultures meet to make this world even more beautiful. The place where children
  fill your heart with love and people use songs and dances to express every feeling.
  Nagaland, the place where we got even more convinced that no matter the challenges
  the world is facing today, the mankind has all the potential to fill this world
  with more love, compassion, music and peace. Seeing is believing they says but for
  me experiencing is believing in oneself and with the things around us. So as an
  individual we should believe that everyday is a memories... Memories created with
  lots of underlying stories of love, happiness and sorrow.
