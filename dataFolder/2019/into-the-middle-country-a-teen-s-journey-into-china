Text: "\"Travel is not a matter of money, but a matter of courage.\" - Paolo Coelho\n\
  \nI spent a week in China when I was fifteen. \n\nI didn't know what I'd find. I\
  \ didn't know who I'd encounter, and most of all, I didn't even know if I had the\
  \ courage to take the fourteen hour flight to Beijing. I had spent the last four\
  \ years learning Mandarin, and not once did I get to speak it to a native without\
  \ stuttering or apologizing profusely. It all built up to this one, massive trip.\
  \ \n\nDay one, I awoke with the rising sun. Sunrise on the 24th floor of a hotel\
  \ facing the east would do that. Everything about the mists and smog that surrounded\
  \ the city on that June day cast it in a familiar haze, but the setting seemed so\
  \ foreign, yet so comforting. \n\nBy day three I was settled. My flight was to Xi'an,\
  \ and I couldn't miss it. There, I discovered myself. \n\nI found myself buried\
  \ in the food, the roasted lamb with seasonings I couldn't identify; in the ramen\
  \ of a Shanghai high-end restaurant; in the beauty of the night lights and a brick\
  \ wall older than the souls that walked it; in the friends jabbering over city traffic\
  \ and the dinner theatre that served the best Korean barbecue I've ever had. \n\n\
  I danced in the middle of a Shanghai market in the rain, completely lost to myself\
  \ and how the winds took me. Friends grinned at me, and soon joined. We were the\
  \ weird American tourists that somehow found joy in the world. \n\nMoral of the\
  \ story: travel won me over. Travel stole my heart and ran off to the four corners\
  \ of the world, leaving me to ever yearn and chase for it. Travel is my first love,\
  \ and one day, it'll be more than just a nineteen-year-old's curiosity to see the\
  \ world. One day it will be my career."
