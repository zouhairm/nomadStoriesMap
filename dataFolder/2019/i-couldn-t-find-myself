Text: "The first time I traveled to Portugal was during my exchange experience as\
  \ a student.\nLots of people told me about how amazing Lisbon was and I was so overexcited\
  \ but I wasn't expecting to find loneliness. I felt lost.\nGoing to Portugal was\
  \ not my first experience abroad and I thought I was a master at leaving home, creating\
  \ connections and learning to love a place, so I was bold and said to friends and\
  \ family \"Do not worry I will be fine!!\"... And I was sure a I would have.\nWhen\
  \ I arrived the horrible truth hit me like the 28 the famous tram in Lisbon: I was\
  \ not happy. \nI couldn't make any friends, I was missing home and I couldn't fall\
  \ in love with the city. I was not myself and I could not manage to feel like the\
  \ person I was in Italy, but why? I was the same person that took the plane! Same\
  \ red hair, same green eyes and same beer belly but still somehow that person didn't\
  \ come to Lisbon with me. \nI started looking for myself. I tried to find the happy\
  \ places for me, the happy activities and the happy cheer-me-up moments but it was\
  \ impossible 'cause I could not find myself anywhere; the only thing I found was\
  \ loneliness.\nBut why me? I left my hometown and lived in Germany for one year\
  \ and no bad things happened.\nI left my hometown to study in another city that\
  \ adopted me and no bad thing happened (beside writing the thesis).\nI left my friends,\
  \ my parents and I was fine, why Lisbon was so hard? \nFor the first time in my\
  \ life I was not managing to adapt to a place and it was horrible.\nI hated the\
  \ people that said to me \"YOU WILL BE HAPPY!\" because they lifted my hopes over\
  \ the clouds.\nThen the truth hit me: it is not about the place you go is about\
  \ the place you leave. It is not the person you are going to become, is about the\
  \ person you are leaving that changes everything.\nI started to realize that you\
  \ mind and your heart have to be in the mood for travel, change and the leap of\
  \ faith that you must make to enjoy the travel. \nApparently, for the first time\
  \ in my life I was happy in the place I was and I was not in need of making another\
  \ change and that's where the loneliness comes from, from the fact that I did not\
  \ want to prepare to take the steps that are mandatory to be made when it comes\
  \ to traveling: learning the language a little bit, meeting new people and interacting\
  \ with a different culture and instead I embraced loneliness.\nWhat I would like\
  \ to say is that traveling is not always happiness and is not always about smile\
  \ but is also about sadness and about tears. \nWhat I learned from finding loneliness\
  \ is that it is possible to learn from anything if you want to do it and for the\
  \ first time in my life I realized that bad thing and bad experiences are the real\
  \ life changing ones. As a matter of fact, finding a lesson when you are sad is\
  \ way harder than when you are happy.\nIt took me awhile but then I completely changed\
  \ my mind and I  feel in love with Lisbon.\nNow after years I can say that I am\
  \ happy for not giving up on the magic of Portugal!\nSo, I couldn't find myself\
  \ and I found loneliness... But I am so glad that I did!\n\nAndrea"
