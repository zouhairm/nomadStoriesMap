Text: "Like every young brown girl, I was expected by my family to be \u201Chomly\u201D\
  \ or domestic. And like every young brown girl, I wanted to explore- the world and\
  \ myself. God knows how much of a struggle I had to put to get out of the house\
  \ and embark on my own journey from north India to the very south- Goa. India is\
  \ so full of different cultures. Every few hundred kilometers you\u2019re introduced\
  \ to a completely new one, and Goa was a few thousand kilometers away from home.\
  \ \nWith houses painted in rich vibrant colours and chapels all around the state\
  \ you can very clearly see the colonial influence. People call Goa the place to\
  \ drink booze and pass out on the beaches but it is so much more than that. \nGoa\
  \ is it\u2019s people who make you feel at home. Goa is it\u2019s Forts, each aesthetic\
  \ building that holds so much history. Goa is it\u2019s beaches, the sand that rubs\
  \ across your feet and makes you feel calm. Goa is the sound of the ocean, which\
  \ calls you back for another adventure. Goa is the view of the setting sun where\
  \ all your problems fade away, and it is just you in the moment, getting lost in\
  \ the beauty of this magnificent place and simultaneously finding yourself. \n\n\
  I lived near the Calangute beach and every morning had a nice brisk walk alongside\
  \ the ocean. Finding food was never a struggle, if Goans love anything more than\
  \ partying-it\u2019s food. The sheds all across the beaches and even in almost every\
  \ corner of the state had thousands of delicacies to serve. \nThe Bollywood fan\
  \ in me got hyped up every time I\u2019d walk through a place where some iconic\
  \ scenes from movies were shot. \nBut the best day had to be the one where I took\
  \ the cruise around Panaji. They let you take part in some water sports mid-course\
  \ like deep ocean swimming, parasailing etc and of course I did it all. Though dolphin\
  \ sighting was the highlight of my day. \n\nWhen you\u2019re traveling to an unknown\
  \ destination, you\u2019re bound to get lost or make mistakes. But that is okay.\
  \ That is the part of the experience and those are the moments that make great stories.\
  \ Like the time when I spent an entire day driving to Goa Karnataka border so that\
  \ I could see the Doodh Sagar waterfall, which is the largest waterfall in India.\
  \ But I reached there are 4:30 and they stop allowing entries after 4:00 so I had\
  \ to drive all the way back to Calangute. But to drive across the Western Ghats,\
  \ listening to the Goan radio, interacting with people along the way, seeing the\
  \ real Goa and not just the tourist attractions; was an experience I wouldn\u2019\
  t exchange for the world. \nTraveling to unknown places has since become a passion.\
  \ The thrill to find your own way and the joy of meeting new people and learning\
  \ about their way of life is one of the most satisfying experience in life. \nGoa\
  \ as a place will always remain close to my heart. I learnt so much and I got so\
  \ much from it. \nThere was a shirt in one of the stalls I saw that said \u201C\
  It\u2019s better in Goa\u201D and even though it\u2019s a weird thing to put on\
  \ a shirt, it\u2019s actually the truth."
