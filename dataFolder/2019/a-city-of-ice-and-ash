Text: "Travellers who come here expect only cold flames.\n\nVisitors gaze with morbid\
  \ fascination upon the high, baroque walls of the Zwinger. They tremble at the awful\
  \ figures that menace from the Hofkirche and at the traces of charcoal on gothic\
  \ stone, they shudder. One by one they turn from this looming hulk that threatens\
  \ to cast the modern concrete, the airy glass, the bright umbrellas and the glistening\
  \ shopfronts into insignificance.\n\nThe opera house conjures officers in grey-green\
  \ jackets, their caps laid politely on their laps, long, pale hands folded as the\
  \ fat blonde sings. Tourists in jeans and worn trainers intermingle with ballgowns\
  \ and tuxedos in the plush Semper bar, disguising their discomfort with over-hearty\
  \ laughter, their manic excitement putting the ghosts to rout. From the lofty Frauenkirche,\
  \ meanwhile, bombs are envisioned bouncing into screaming crowds.\n\nThe thing that\
  \ happened is whispered with raised eyebrows, is rarely contrasted with what is\
  \ now and what came before. English is spoken, as in most places, with embarrassment,\
  \ but here with a special kind of shame. Barmen, waiters, tour guides find their\
  \ eyes unmet; locals passing by discover their presence has a curious dimming effect\
  \ on foreigners\u2019 conversation. Battered copies of Farenheit 451 are held shyly\
  \ against chests or slipped slyly into coat pockets. \n\nHuddles of murmuring travellers\
  \ look up at the rebuilt roofs, stare at memorials and are, for a moment, silenced.\
  \ Then, with relief, steins are quaffed and conversations begin about tomorrow\u2019\
  s train to Prague. These are the city\u2019s visitors. For them, it is a shell filled\
  \ with cold, old smoke - they come, they absolve themselves, they go.\n\nWhen we\
  \ arrived, we found ice and light and heat.\n\nA room with a sloping roof and a\
  \ window full of wintry sun. Expanses of clean grey along which we would trot in\
  \ search of coffee and strudel, in cafes whose glass walls framed a scene in which\
  \ old and new bled into one another. Workers hurrying past, their breath rising\
  \ like steam from the blackened buildings.\n\nIn high-ceilinged rooms, we wandered\
  \ among gilded nudes, snatched babies, tortured martyrs, embattled heroes. Squat\
  \ heads and tall foreheads, out of proportion with strangely twisted torsos, earned\
  \ conspiratorial giggles. Eyes wide, we pointed out bizarre monsters and grotesque\
  \ faces, our own racked with silent laughter. Thigh to thigh we sat, mesmerised\
  \ by daydreaming cherubs.\n\nAcross the river we rummaged through the more recent\
  \ past, holding up snatches of vanished lives, flinging open cases and bags and\
  \ books to surprise ourselves. The guardians of the treasure trove were pleased\
  \ to see us there in our thick coats and beckoned us over to ration books, crumbling\
  \ maps, musty postcards bound with elastic bands. These postcards showed us the\
  \ time before - in them survived the words of friends, families and lovers, refugees\
  \ from a moment of destruction.\n\nIn the dim light of the concert hall, I could\
  \ make out your shape across the gallery. Rows of heads stretched forward as the\
  \ horns took up their call - when I looked, the pale oval of your face was turned\
  \ my way. Afterwards, we sat watching glittering passers-by acting out their own\
  \ dramas, the womb-like red of the furnishings reflected in our negronis.\n\nI left\
  \ you writing, to claim my own place in the city. Circling around churches and halls\
  \ that eyed me warily, I climbed the palace walls and befriended the gargoyles and\
  \ angels, made my way around to view the mute fountains from every angle. Down again\
  \ and into shops, with books and artwork and souvenirs, and out again and round\
  \ and round trying to get back, a deep shiver setting in, my hands stiffer and bluer\
  \ with each step. When I think of Dresden, I think of you then, blowing on my hands\
  \ as I try to explain to you what I saw, what the city showed me and me alone. I\
  \ think of sweating in a hot bath in the room with the low roof, and you writing\
  \ at the desk with the rotund Frauenkirche watching through the window. I think\
  \ of a city of warmth and ice, shrugging a dusting of ash from its shoulders and\
  \ waiting, patiently, to be seen."
