Text: "Writtingnomads\n\nBeing travelled to Bulgaria is not even part of my life plan.\
  \ It was just ad hoc. A decision I made by a spur of moment. I never knew a country\
  \ name Bulgaria exist until I watched Vampire Diaries series whereby the female\
  \ lead character\u2019s doppelg\xE4nger was born in Bulgaria. It seems like the\
  \ practice of witchcraft was very common back then for them to maintain their youth\
  \ and makes them looks more alluring. That was it. That was then. That\u2019s the\
  \ only thing that i knew about Bulgaria until I saw a promotion of the flight fare\
  \ going to Athens for just less than 500 dollars. A deal that i would cry for if\
  \ I miss the catch.  So i booked the flight for 12 days and I was thinking on what\
  \ I want to do in Athens for 12 days since Acropolis tour will just take less than\
  \ a day.My travel buddy suggested that we might want to take flight to go somewhere\
  \ from Athens and Balkan was popped out from her mouth then. I started my research\
  \ and found flight to Sofia Bulgaria for less than 100 dollars. Bulgaria is part\
  \ of Balkan territory so lets give it a try and so i choose Sofia, capital of Bulgaria.\
  \ I ditched another popular cities because I am so sick of scammers, beggars and\
  \ over flooded tourists everywhere. I just want somewhere peaceful, just local and\
  \ less touristy. I dont put so much hope on it. We waited patiently until the arrival\
  \ of the day. We need to clear immigration from Athens to Sofia. Not sure why because\
  \ I thought EU country does not required that but after i read somewhere, it is\
  \ something to do with Schengen or Non Schengen countries visa.They are just EU\
  \ memberstates, something like London and Paris when you want to cross the boarder,\
  \ you still need to do the immigration clearance. Back to the story, we arrived\
  \ in Sofia finally. I am a cabin crew member so i have this common practice of mine\
  \ whereby I will attached my crew credential/authority card altogether with my passport.\
  \ When immigration officers know you are a cabin crew they will be more friendly\
  \ towards you, and it works greatly so far with me because sometimes they will give\
  \ you hard time with numerous ridiculous questions about where are you from, what\
  \ are you doing in their country etc etc and thats how I escaped from that.  Being\
  \ one of European conservative country, the elder generation cant speak English\
  \ that much. So to make our life easier, we approached the youngsters to ask for\
  \ directions and information. Besides, the are big numbers of older generation in\
  \ Sofia as they said the birth rate are critical over there.The funny part is when\
  \ I took tram or train rides, i barely can sit because 80% of the population is\
  \ elderly people so I need to give up my seat at all times. The wordings are similar\
  \ with Russia. I\u2019ve been to Russia before so its not that difficult to decipher\
  \ the code. For instance, PECTOPAH means a restaurant. Going to Sofia is one of\
  \ the greatest memories of my life. Its not packed with the tourists. The local\
  \ just enjoying their lives. They are so laid back. Easy to find meals that suits\
  \ my dietary. The cathedral, synagogue and mosque are just walking distance to each\
  \ others. As a proof that every religion respect each other\u2019s practice and\
  \ live in harmony despite of different practices. It is one of the affordable european\
  \ country to visit. The public transport is quite efficient. It is a modern classic\
  \ type of place.l forget to mention, the view Vitosha Mountain is extremely stunning.\
  \ If you are on your tight budget and really wish to see something that is similar\
  \ with Swiss Alps, Vitosha Mountain is the answer. Upon landing in Sofia, I was\
  \ in awe overlooking the white ground full with snow, with the mountains as the\
  \ backdrop. Such a beautiful creation it is.\nI made the right decision of going\
  \ here. The people are friendly, the place is peaceful and it is super cheap, you\
  \ dont need to break your bank when u travel to Sofia. On the day of our arrival,\
  \ there were snow showers and being a typical asian girl, having a snow is something\
  \ that we really looking forward to because it is not easy to experience this at\
  \ all time. We giggled in joy upon the snow showers session as if like playing in\
  \ the rains back then in our country. Dear Bulgaria, sure I will be back one day.\
  \ This is the most memorable experience ever in my life and Bulgaria, you hold a\
  \ special place in my heart, ever!"
