Text: "\u201CShe could die at any moment, make this trip count\u201D I solemnly swear\
  \ to myself as I look over from the driver\u2019s seat at my sister. The spring\
  \ sun was piercing the mist, unveiling the granite tops of the mountains in Tasmania\u2019\
  s Freycinet National Park, two and a half hours north of Hobart  As our car bounced\
  \ along the winding, rough, gravel road, my mind raced. I couldn\u2019t stop thinking\
  \ about why we were here.\n \nWe had taken solace in Tasmania to escape the reality\
  \ that in a week the person I loved most in the world would undergo 6 hours of life-threatening\
  \ open heart surgery. At age 31, Rebecca had grown into a majestic young woman -\
  \ tall, lean and athletic with thick long curly brown hair like a Dutch doll. The\
  \ news was an unexpected shock to our family. We couldn\u2019t comprehend that in\
  \ just a number of days she would be dancing with death.\n \nRebecca\u2019s bucket\
  \ list request was simple, to go somewhere remote. No phones. No Internet.  Her\
  \ wish was granted in rugged Tasmania, a land of raw and untouched natural beauty.\
  \ We slowly pulled into our first \u2018no distractions\u2019 adventure, a trek\
  \ on the Wineglass Bay Track. The thin, twig-like trees that greeted us were separated\
  \ by a meter of a well-trodden yellow dirt path, acting as a red carpet welcome\
  \ to my family. \n \nWe began our ascent, clambering up red rocks that mimicked\
  \ giant nuggets of honeycomb. I constantly misplaced my footing as I tried to tame\
  \ the wild thoughts that had plagued me ever since hearing the news: \u201CWhat\
  \ will I do if she doesn\u2019t survive?\u201D, \u201CIf something goes wrong, how\
  \ can I afford to pay for her?\u201D, \u201CHow will I tell work I need 3 months\
  \ off to care for her?\u201D, \u201CWhy is this happening to us, she\u2019s so young!\u201D\
  . The relentless questions and thoughts tormented me as I fought to hold back tears,\
  \ robbing me of experiencing any pleasure in such a magical, natural wonderland.\n\
  \ \nAs the sun continued to beat down on our backs, I began to watch my long legged\
  \ sister effortlessly glide up the steep path. Our arms brushed up against the green\
  \ shrubs that marked our way. We were welcomed to the summit through a foliage-encrusted\
  \ walkway that flirted with what was about to greet us. Stepping onto the platform,\
  \ I was immediately struck by the sight and how insignificant my problems were.\
  \ Greeting us was a view of an endless forest that hugged the semicircle beach of\
  \ Wineglass Bay, I could see why it is voted one of the most beautiful beaches in\
  \ the world with its paperwhite sand and azure blue water. Rebecca slid her elongated\
  \ fingers into my hand and pierced me with her green eyes, a soft smile gently lighting\
  \ up her face.\n \nShe was the calmest of us all. Peaceful and serene, shrugging\
  \ off any fear of death as if it was nothing. I remembered the promise I made. Holding\
  \ the map in my hand, I found all I needed was to guide my own mind. I held onto\
  \ her as I leaned over the railing to soak up the view of the valley below, squealing\
  \ with delight as I spotted a humpback whale spouting on its journey bound for Antarctica.\
  \ A truce was signed as the battle in my mind came to an end. It no longer mattered\
  \ if she\u2019d live or die, it was where I was with her right now, enjoying the\
  \ gift of time I had, that counted. A lesson I\u2019d take with me on the days and\
  \ weeks to come."
