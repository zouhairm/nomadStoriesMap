Text: "Think of Bali and the next word that pops up in my mind is Love! From the moment\
  \ I set my foot in Indonesia from Malaysia, things had been quite a rollercoaster,\
  \ right from immigration stamps to clearing custom checks. \n\nNo matter the words\
  \ that follow, I will never be able to truly describe the indelible memories of\
  \ Bali that have been etched deep in my mind in their complete essence. The truth\
  \ is it was inevitable for me to not fall in love with the tranquil beaches, the\
  \ islands, the red & frosty sunsets and most importantly, the lovely people I met.\
  \ Getting to meet backpackers from all walks of life and from different parts of\
  \ the globe in their rawest form made this trip worth every moment. The warm feeling\
  \ emanating from strange people in strange places is what keeps your heart light\
  \ as you explore the unknown. The best part about solo backpacking is the fact that\
  \ when you travel you don\u2019t need to pretend to be someone else. You end up\
  \ bonding effortlessly with every fellow travel mate who seems to share your vibe.\n\
  \n\nSouth of Bali \u2013 Kuta and Seminyak Beach: Surfing for the first time!\n\n\
  I  had made this pact with myself that I will try at least one new adventurous activity\
  \ every year. I had already tried snorkeling for the first time in Thailand this\
  \ year and I thought why not try surfing as well! In case you\u2019re wondering\
  \ if swimming is a pre-requisite for surfing, let me tell you that it\u2019s absolutely\
  \ not. Our trainer instructed us for the first twenty minutes on how to keep our\
  \ balance on the surfboards. We couldn\u2019t risk being clumsy on the sea because\
  \ many people do end up having to get stitches after having hurt themselves with\
  \ the fin boards beneath the surfboards. The first hour I was mostly exasperated\
  \ with falling off the surfboard over and again. As I gradually started to get my\
  \ grip and realize my mistakes, I thankfully got on pretty good for the next couple\
  \ of hours. Once I could successfully balance on the surfboard, the victorious and\
  \ exhilarating feeling that followed was totally worth the exhaustion that comes\
  \ along in this stint. I do suggest that you don\u2019t return from Bali without\
  \ going for a surf.\n\n North of Bali- Ubud: A day meant to be for Hiking Indonesia\u2019\
  s active Volcano!\n\nFrom here onwards things just started getting better and better.\
  \ This was the day when I had to get ready for the ambitious sunrise trek to Mount\
  \ Batur which was the main reason for me to visit Indonesia. Lately because of the\
  \ Tsunami that had hit the northern coast, the weather wasn\u2019t getting any better\
  \ and I was quite concerned about the fog. Fortunately, the very night that I left\
  \ my hostel along with the other hikers from at 2 a.m. for the trek, the weather\
  \ started clearing up and I must say that I haven\u2019t been under such a starry\
  \ night in a very long time.  I was so jittery with excitement for the trek. It\
  \ takes about 2 hours of climbing up the accent over a rocky terrain which is a\
  \ little exhausting yet greatly rewarding. \nThe view that lay unraveled in front\
  \ of our eyes was too surreal to be true. After a moment of hype, we all calmed\
  \ down and enjoyed our moments of solitude while taking in as much of the spectacular\
  \ sunrise as we could.\n\nVisit to the Nusa Penida Islands; Snorkeling at Crystal\
  \ Bay : Getting there and the beaches to explore\n\nWanderlust-stricken souls who\
  \ have been keeping track of the travel feeds on the internet would know what I\
  \ am talking about- the breathtakingly beautiful Nusa Penida Island. This heavenly\
  \ island has a possibility of getting submerged in the ocean and that\u2019s the\
  \ reason it has flooded the internet. \nSomeone had said, \u201CTreacherous roads\
  \ lead to beautiful destinations\u201D. You would agree as much as I do if you do\
  \ ride a bike till here. When we finally reached there, I was like, \u201COh dear!\
  \  Glad I made it here.\u201D  Bali was the best thing that had happened to me this\
  \ year on Durga Puja"
