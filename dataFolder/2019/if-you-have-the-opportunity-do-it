Text: "My eyes filled with tears as I saw the Sanctuary of Santa Luzia getting smaller\
  \ as we advanced the road. Six months before, Carnival eve in Brazil, everybody\
  \ was excited about the festivities and I could not think of anything else: \u201C\
  I'm going to Portugal!\u201D. Anxiety had taken my mind, I had already remade my\
  \ luggage at least three times and checked my documents about twenty. It was my\
  \ first trip to Europe and my first trip alone! I was unable to sleep on the plane\
  \ and arrived in Lisbon very worried about not losing the connection. Another forty\
  \ minutes flying and I was in Porto. I was too excited!\n\nMe and Viana, it was\
  \ love at first sight! I remember thinking \"I arrived\" when I saw the large Combatentes\
  \ Avenue. At the end of the avenue I could already see the Train Station of Viana,\
  \ on the top of the hill, in the background, the Sanctuary of Santa Luzia, and to\
  \ my left, the little street that today I remember as my home - \"Rua do Anjinho\"\
  . I got out of the car to my adventure.\n\nIn the first week, I went to the school\
  \ where I would have my classes. It was there that I had my first contact with some\
  \ ERASMUS students. When you are away from your blood family, the ERASMUS students\
  \ become your family.\n\nIn my ERASMUS family, there were Brazilians with whom I\
  \ traveled and shared homesicknesses. With my Polish, Czech and Spanish relatives,\
  \ I spent an Easter holiday. My Romanian sister couldn\xB4t see me at a party without\
  \ shouting \"shot\" and what followed that were a lot of tequila all night long.\
  \ I also enjoyed meeting my Italian family for a chat in the afternoon. I used to\
  \ leave home at 11 pm to meet my Portuguese family at Caf\xE9 Paris, I will never\
  \ understand the Portuguese's habit of drinking coffee at 11 pm, but I can understand\
  \ perfectly why they always meet friends to talk about life. This was the first\
  \ thing I didn\xB4t expect to find in Portugal, a new family that welcomed me with\
  \ open arms.\n\n\nOf course, when you are away from home not everything is easy,\
  \ so that was how I learned the second thing I didn\u2019t expect, the need to grow\
  \ up in record time. I had to deal with a lot of stuff that I never needed. When\
  \ you're on the other side of the world, you need to manage things by yourself,\
  \ and that was my second lesson.\n\nAt the end of my student exchange, I decided\
  \ to take a trip with a Brazilian friend that I met in Viana. We planned everything.\
  \ We bought tickets, booked accommodations and Couchsurfing, chose activities, everything\
  \ was right! Two weeks before, it was Soccer World Cup, Brazil game, we went to\
  \ watch on a big screen that was placed near to home. My friend drank two liters\
  \ of beer and went back home carrying a skateboard from another friend of ours.\
  \ About forty minutes later, I was leaving Viana to Braga and got a call from someone\
  \ crying \"Bruna, I was riding Giu's skateboard and I fell!\" We took her to the\
  \ hospital and... fracture! In two different places. She went earlier to Brazil\
  \ and I saw myself on a trip through nine cities and four different languages. On\
  \ the trip\u2019s eve, I despaired. I called crying to my mother \"Mom, I don\u2019\
  t think I can do this! I'm a woman, I'm going to travel alone. What if there's a\
  \ problem on the plane? My friend broke her foot, it could be a sign! \" Everything\
  \ was going through my head, from an air disaster to a turtle biting my heel. My\
  \ mother calmed me down and I went. And it was one of the most incredible experiences\
  \ of my life! I met people from several different cultures, incredible places, and\
  \ most importantly: I was able to get to know myself and that was the third thing\
  \ I did not expect to find. \n\nSo I leave you with two messages that I learned\
  \ in my travels everything happens for a reason and if you have the opportunity,\
  \ do it!"
