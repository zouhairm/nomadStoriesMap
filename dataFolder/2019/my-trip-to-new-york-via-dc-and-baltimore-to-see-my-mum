Text: "To be honest it was two days before my birthday and I had my son with me, and\
  \ hoped to connect with my daughter in Canada to come to New York and join us on\
  \ a trip to try and celebrate my birthday in Disney World Florida.\n\nI planned\
  \ it well and booked my car hire at the same time as booking my British Airways\
  \ return ticket for my son and I at the time, my mum was expecting, too in New York.\n\
  \nBut what i didn't expect to happen,  I arrived at Washington DC with my son, from\
  \ London our first trip to DC ever, and I was shocked that my joy was dashed as\
  \ i got to the British Airways Car Hire Desk at DC, Airport,\n\nSo when I arrived\
  \ at the Car Hire Desk and was told sorry there was no car reserved for you and\
  \ don't worry your paid money will be refunded when you  returned to London? I was\
  \ devastated, I queried why I got no phone calls? no emails no letters from either\
  \ The British Airways or it's Car Hire company even two weeks after the holidays\
  \ flights and Car was hired and paid for? The reply I got was even more shocking,\
  \ as am told it was only decided the very day I was to pick the car up and they\
  \ were sorry and couldn't communicate with me whilst i was in flight and on air\
  \ traveling from London to Washington DC, to me it was pathetic, excuse, most unexpected,\
  \ lame excuse and sadly ruined my holidays,  I had tight budget, how get a new Car\
  \ Hire.\n\nAll my plans were shattered as Florida suddenly seemed far out of my\
  \ reach, so i took the amtrak to Baltimore the very next day after breakfast as\
  \ advised that's the best way to go to New York, to visit my mum,  I was sad still,\
  \ and my hotel manager noticed my heavy frown, and walked up to me asking how can\
  \ such a beautiful face be so sad, and I told him what's eating  me, and he said\
  \ it's that all? i said is that not enough? \n\nHe said give me five minutes. with\
  \ his help,  I went off to Enterprise Motors  in Baltimore the very next day on\
  \ the 19th which was the day before my birthday and picked up a Nissan car, and\
  \ drove to New York without a Sat nav, as my son had the printed road directions,\
  \ advising us to have my son read instructions whilst i drive. The journey was terrific,\
  \ but as I entered New York, a car ram, hitting my car sad!\n\nThen a local dude\
  \ got in the car and literally showed me, my mother's address,  i saw my mum and\
  \ was Happy for the 1st time since arriving in the USA. \n\nI drove back to Baltimore\
  \ and handed the keys trying to explain another car rammed my car's arse in New\
  \ York, Enterprise motor staff took the keys and said it's ok Helen, you insured,\
  \ and it's nothing just a tiny bump. and they handed me a birthday cake, and said\
  \ together \"Happy Birthday Helen, \n\nI shall never forget my Marriot Hotel manager,\
  \ getting me a car at all to go see  my mum, I will never forget how hard it was\
  \ to decide not to risk mum's life, for my own pleasure of inclusion, lest I live\
  \ to regret it if she had asthma attack on her way back alone without me, on the\
  \ amtrak, I will never forget the Enterprise motors staff giving me a birthday cake,\
  \ was most unexpected, and I will never forget my legendary drive on American road,\
  \ whilst my son was pissed off to and fro, wishing I could let him drive, but how\
  \ a seriously discipline me, was abiding by the law that, says son has to be certain\
  \ age, and added to car insurance to drive and i didn't want to spend my birthday\
  \ in police cell, in case we get pulled over for speeding, given he is a young star,\
  \ and that pissed him the hell off to and fro."
