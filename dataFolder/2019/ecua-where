Text: "The question: If someone gave you a ticket to go anywhere in the world, but\
  \ you had to leave now, would you go?\n\nBorderline cliched, that question had always\
  \ been accompanied my a laugh in my mind and a strong stance on it being a hypothetical\
  \ that was impossible. An impossible question that entertained me enough to work\
  \ up the perfect answer \"I would 100%, without a doubt, leave right now\" in hope\
  \ that if this impossible situation ever arose, I would at least be wearing comfortable\
  \ shoes and have a fully charged phone.\n\nThe early days of post-university was\
  \ kept company by unemployment and \"No, I do not have 10 years work experience\
  \ as a working professional, can someone please hire me now\". The job market was\
  \ unkind and my parents couch uncomfortable. If life was an upbeat movie with a\
  \ good ending, this would be the point where a fairy god mother waves her wand and\
  \ boom, employment and taxes. Nevertheless, my life was the furthest thing from\
  \ ever being a movie. Unemployment afforded me all the time to lose myself in social\
  \ media stalks and YouTube binges. I guess a good internet stalk has its purpose\
  \ as I found myself mindlessly completing and submitting an application to volunteer\
  \ teaching English in Ecuador. Ecuador, was that a country?\n\nMy life is low key\
  \ a movie because less than a month later, I received a follow up email for this\
  \ volunteer program. A quick interview, some documents signed and few weeks later,\
  \ the organisation had booked my return ticket from South Africa to Ecuador. A quick\
  \ Google search confirmed that Ecuador was actually a country found on the western\
  \ coast of South America, on the equator. I guess this wasn't a ticket to anywhere\
  \ in the world but it did wear the \"but you need to leave now\" dress quite fittingly.\
  \ A hypothetical, impossible situation became my reality as I was given barely a\
  \ few weeks to inform my family and friends that I was about to move to Ecuador\
  \ for the next year. This announcement was greeted by confusion and multiple \"\
  Where is Ecuador?\" questions. \n\nDid I know what I was getting myself in to? No.\n\
  Did I know anything about Ecuador? No.\nWas I still going to go? Absolutely yes!\n\
  \nThis was my adventure and it beat my parents couch every single time. Ecuador\
  \ was a country on the equator and I was being placed in a town called Playas that\
  \ was on the coast (according to emails) helped me pack my suitcase and buy a bottle\
  \ too many of sunscreen. I immediately stopped learning German on DuoLingo as my\
  \ brothers told me that the official language was Spanish. I avoided google searches\
  \ and Ecuador related information as the fear of knowing too much might pull me\
  \ out of this adventure before me. What is the other cliche, ignorance is bliss?\
  \ The moment I received flight confirmation, a conversation with myself decided\
  \ that I would just go and hope for the best - something that was completely out\
  \ of character. \n\nI travel itinerary just shy of 24 hours, I landed in Quito.\
  \ Tired. Confused. Lost. Doubting this decision and questioning my entire existence.\
  \ I should have at least started learning some Spanish prior to leaving South Africa.\
  \ Zero service, signs that made me question whether I was dyslexic and the wish\
  \ that my movie fairy god mother would appear to help me out in that moment. I am\
  \ all for the adventure but had I just taken it too far, and does this place come\
  \ with English subtitles? Among all the inner doubt on this major life decision\
  \ to move continents, there was a calm and a persistent feeling of it will be great\
  \ and you are exactly where you're meant to be.\n\nMy bags and the sense that I\
  \ had already begun the biggest adventure of my 20-something life, I waited (low\
  \ key was stranded) for 3 hours before a driver waddled in to take me into the Ecuadorean\
  \ night and onto the next chapter of this unbelievable and slightly insane journey."
