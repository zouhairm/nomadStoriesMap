Text: "We wanted wilderness. Somewhere nobody would find us, somewhere we could dance\
  \ naked around a fire like shameless pagans and hoot like happy owls. We volunteered\
  \ in villages flat as the Earth once was, before Eratosthenes proved it round, and\
  \ wanted the opposite so headed to the Caucasus, the glaciated mountains separating\
  \ the Republic of Georgia from Russia.\nJenny and I met up in Tbilisi, at the only\
  \ map store in the country, and found a freckle of a lake that was guarded by a\
  \ mountain pass and being June, the snow was still going and Jenny didn't know what\
  \ a mountain was, she'd been sea level her entire life. No matter what she asked\
  \ I had to be cool, wear an expression on my face that read piece of cake. \nAfter\
  \ a few days acclimating we reached the slope, 3100 meters straight up with just\
  \ some vague switch backs carved by mountain goats, and if we were going up that\
  \ hill I couldn't break my cool. Half the time I was shaking, we cried a few times\
  \ when on all fours, afraid too look down at a chasm below. After scrambling 6 hours\
  \ we got there and Jenny took a photo I'll show my kids some day; Clouds and snow\
  \ all around, I'm wearing a turquoise jumper and jeans torn at the knees, holding\
  \ a meter-long missile I found sticking in the ground.\nHeading down, we slipped\
  \ on snow banks, scrambled on scree fields, maneuvered around boulders, and finally\
  \ got to the valley. The valley was long and green as a key lime, purple and red\
  \ wildflowers dotted the meadow, and in the middle was Lake Tanies! Shaped like\
  \ a kidney bean and clear as the air with little streams of snowmelt draining to\
  \ feed it. We threw off our clothes, filthy with perspiration and grit, screamed\
  \ and jumped in. We swam frantic circles until we were numb, then hobbled out and\
  \ laid under the sun. \nWe were alone! Well... For about 20 minutes until two soldiers\
  \ came dawdling down the pass. We dressed fast, like momma just pulled into the\
  \ driveway before schedule. The soldiers enigmatic, mainly because of the language\
  \ barrier, and told us to follow which we did, because it's best to listen to people\
  \ with guns. \nTheir outpost was a trailer, outhouse, and gym surrounded by Ovcharka's-the\
  \ largest dogs in the world and when non-domesticated, not something to mess with.\
  \ They foam at the mouth when angry and when they see something they don't like,\
  \ they're angry. \nThey escorted us inside and we spoke with the commander in our\
  \ elementary Georgian. At the end of the valley was the border into Chechnya. Russia\
  \ forcefully grabbed two regions from Georgia a few years prior, and the two are\
  \ not fond of another. The soldiers pointed at our shoddy tent, second hand boots,\
  \ and jeans, and said a storm was starting tonight and would last several days.\
  \ Of course I acted cool, but when Jenny said maybe we should stay with them, I\
  \ casually agreed. An hour later the rain came, and came strong, the valley had\
  \ no trees. The tent would've been soaked in an hour, we had no choice but to settle\
  \ down.\nWe talked as much as we could all night. We saw family photos, ate meals\
  \ of tinned fish and baguettes that would rival those in Paris. One soldier had\
  \ a knack for cooking and would make bread from scratch and cook in a wood-burning\
  \ stove. We stayed in that kitchen 4 days, and were escorted everywhere, because\
  \ of the dogs-we weren't prisoners. At night we slept on the gym floor in our sleeping\
  \ bags below a poster the soldiers venerated of Ashley Tisdale. The night before\
  \ the storm let up, the soldiers kicked around an old generator till it cranked,\
  \ then attached a TV and satellite. The commander mustered up a bottle of chacha,\
  \ Georgian moonshine, out from hiding and we watched the first game of the World\
  \ Cup. The next day the soldiers walked us to where they found us and we thanked\
  \ them for their hospitality and giving us that twenty minutes of privacy."
