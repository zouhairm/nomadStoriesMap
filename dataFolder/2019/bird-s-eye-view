Text: "The uncharacteristically forgiving October enjoyed by onlookers is the same\
  \ which the competitors curse. Mongolia is famously frigid, but on day two of the\
  \ Golden Eagle Festival, I can comfortably go without a coat. Speculation circulates\
  \ that the eagles are prone to indolence in warmer temperatures. The more likely\
  \ explanation is that they are spooked by the hordes. Over a thousand spectators,\
  \ comprising locals and tourists alike, are gathered in the Bayan-\xD6lgii province\
  \ to watch the Kazakh eagle hunters demonstrate their prowess at the annual celebration.\
  \ Each hopeful hunter begins in the same way. One after another they stride out\
  \ and bait the eagles with raw meat, calling out to them in variations of rich bellows\
  \ and piercing whoops. Their entreaties reach for the mountain where the echoes\
  \ dance from peak to peak. The countdown would start. Every once in a while an eagle\
  \ might take flight, only to circle back around to the craggy cliffside. And even\
  \ more rarely, one would achieve the desired trajectory\u2014the leisurely sail,\
  \ the torturous tangents, the sharp climactic dive\u2014at last, descending triumphantly\
  \ on the expectant forearm of its master.\n\nA dwindling but proud band of nomads\
  \ still continue the centuries-old practice of capturing an eaglet at birth for\
  \ the purpose of training it to hunt alongside humans. The birds are well-suited\
  \ to detecting prey along the vast, flat Eurasian steppe, which on this afternoon\
  \ is disturbed by bustling activity. The scene is compelling in its strangeness,\
  \ its seeming incompatibility: hunters saunter about in the ancestral garb as drones\
  \ swirl overhead. Their robotic hum competes with the sound of folk music being\
  \ played on the dombra. Here in Mongolia, my senses are treated to a surreal experience,\
  \ a blend of futuristic and traditional elements.\n\nThe eagle hunters cede the\
  \ spotlight to riders, who gallop through the makeshift arena picking up coins off\
  \ the ground in stunning displays of horsemanship. It is around this time that I\
  \ decide to abandon my viewing spot for a survey of the main stage. Minimally furnished,\
  \ it has little more room for anything other than a narrow table from which judges\
  \ oversee the sporting events. One of them is a regal elder with whom I meet eyes.\
  \ He is striking in his furs, worn over a Western-style collared shirt. I raise\
  \ my camera inquisitively\u2014and he nods gently in consent.\n\nHis air of composure\
  \ and otherworldly calm comes in stark contrast to the commotion just below. A small\
  \ assembly of contestants swarms the base of the stage, agitating over what I can\
  \ only gather are the results of the most recent round. A dozen upturned faces demanding\u2014\
  a verdict? A recount? I can only guess at the meaning of the dynamic gesturing and\
  \ impassioned voices hurled in the direction of the scoresheet. Once again, I raise\
  \ my camera. But the crowd is too large, too unruly for me to be able to get a shot.\n\
  \nJust then I feel a tap on my shoulder. I turn to find an extended hand, a leathery\
  \ invitation onstage at the request of the elder. Before I know it, I am hoisted\
  \ up and and offered a seat beside him on the bench. From this special vantage I\
  \ can appreciate in perfect clarity every detail of the festivities\u2014every furrow\
  \ on the imploring hunter\u2019s brow, the dramatic flourish of dust that kicks\
  \ up whenever a horseman successfully swipes a coin. The gloating antics of the\
  \ victor, his joy matching my own. I can hardly dare to believe my good fortune,\
  \ the new altitude. For the moment I inhabit the perspective of a golden eagle,\
  \ with a privileged view up to the far hems of the landscape. My gratitude is inexpressible\
  \ through words; in any case, none avail themselves in a shared language. I try\
  \ instead to convey thanks by way of a hand to the heart, an earnest smile. The\
  \ elder\u2019s gentle nod of consent becomes a nod of comprehension. My winged missive\
  \ alights. Between us not a word exchanged, but all understood."
