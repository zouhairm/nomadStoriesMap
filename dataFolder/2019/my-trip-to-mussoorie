Text: "Firstly Hello to all the Judges !!\nThe culture, weather and beauty of Mussoorie\
  \ is totally different and unique from other hill stations. Mussoorie is a hill\
  \ station of Uttarakhand. I have traveled to many other hill stations in India with\
  \ my friends and family, but when I visited Mussoorie for the first time last year,\
  \ I found that Mussoorie is the best out of them. I have heard people saying that\
  \ Mussoorie is 'the Queen of Hills' and I also recognized that this is totally true\
  \ through my visit. On my visit to this beautiful hill station I found a lot of\
  \ adventure sports activities like river rafting, rappelling, Rock Climbing and\
  \ bungee jumping here. The weather is always pleasant here. \nOur office every year\
  \ take us on a vacation , this year we planned to go Mussoorie where we spent three\
  \ days and two nights vacation in the beautiful hill station. Our journey started\
  \ on 18 October's night by bus. Our office has arranged 4 buses for its employees.\
  \ We reached Mussoorie early in the morning around 8 am. We stayed at Dunsvirk Court\
  \ in Mussoorie. It is on the top of hill and off the Mall Road. They welcomed us\
  \ with a big smile and lot of warmth. We were given executive rooms on first floor,\
  \ which were nice, cozy, neat and clean. I would call it a 5.0 star property. We\
  \ felt very close to nature here. All the recreational activities we did in these\
  \ three days refreshed us up from the daily tiresome life. I will share a little\
  \ information on some of the must watch places in Mussoorie that we visited in our\
  \ trip. Our first visit was to Company Garden. This is a very famous Garden, has\
  \ a large collection of flowers and plants.Once you reach there and if you are with\
  \ children, there are couple of rides for kids that they can enjoy, and little pond\
  \ where boating can be done. The pond is too small for boating hence will only be\
  \ enjoyed by kids. If you are all adults, avoid it. Then we decided to take some\
  \ rest in the hotel and in the evening went out for shopping in mall road. The other\
  \ places we included in our visit list are SOHAM Heritage & Art Centre, Shedup Choepelling\
  \ Temple, Mussoorie Christ Church, Nag Devta Temple and Jwala Devi Temple. We also\
  \ enjoyed watching Kempty Falls and Jharipani Falls. Another must visit place in\
  \ Mussoorie is Benog Wildlife Sanctuary. This is really a bird-watching heaven and\
  \ home to several species of exotic birds such as White Capped Water Redstart and\
  \ Red Billed Blue Magpie. We also had a visit to Happy Valley. There we could see\
  \ a Tibetan school and a Buddha Temple. We also visited Dhanaulti , because of its\
  \ famous eco park. The main tourist spot in Mussoorie that we enjoyed a lot is the\
  \ Mussoorie Adventure Park. We had great fun there, enjoyed almost all the adventure\
  \ sports namely Sky Ride- Superman Zip Line, valley crossing, Rock climbing, Rappelling,\
  \ Zip swing, Rope course, Trekking Camping etc. Really our holiday trip to Mussoorie\
  \ was unforgettable. We returned on 21 October night with lots of memories in our\
  \ mind."
