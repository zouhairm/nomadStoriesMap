Text: "Ni Made always work long before us in the morning. When the cockerels squawked,\
  \ we could hear her shushing them. If we stepped outside, we\u2019d be sure to see\
  \ her urging her children to follow their morning rituals at the sacred tree, or\
  \ singing as she washed the dishes after breakfast. \n\nShe always had to be up\
  \ first, she told us. Before her husband, the children, her husband\u2019s parents,\
  \ and her husband\u2019s brother and his wife that lived with them. She was chief\
  \ woman of the family compound \u2013 she had many duties. Every morning, before\
  \ they stirred, she was lighting the incense on the daily Hindu offerings to the\
  \ gods, praying at the family temple, making sure that everything was in order for\
  \ the coming day. \n\nIn the evenings, she would sit outside with her eldest son,\
  \ cutting and twisting coconut leaves into square baskets. These baskets were filled\
  \ with flower petals, pieces of fruit, sweets and plastic jewelry, and left outside\
  \ every morning, noon and night for the gods, to keep the family safe. \n\nNi Made\
  \ worked in a bank \u2013 she was not a stay-at-home mother. While her husband and\
  \ sons worked in the paddy fields, and her daughter attended school, she worked\
  \ in the one large bank in the town, counting and sorting money. In the evenings,\
  \ she would return home, cook the dinner, help the children with the homework, and\
  \ perform the nightly religious rituals required. Hearing about her day constantly\
  \ made me feel exhausted. \n\nShe was constantly emphasising the importance of education\
  \ to her children. As someone who had left school at the age of ten, she had self-taught\
  \ herself English through listening to the Australian tourists that traipsed through\
  \ the nearby town of Ubud every day. She knew that for her sons and daughters, there\
  \ would be more opportunities if they too could speak English and studied hard.\
  \ She pushed them to speak with us, these awkwardly white Europeans that took over\
  \ part of their home for the summer months, but for the most part, they were too\
  \ shy. \n\n The Balinese have more birthdays than Westerners, Ni Made told me. One\
  \ day, she took out an enormous calendar and she began to explain the concept of\
  \ the festivals to me \u2013 each family member has two birthdays per year, there\
  \ are regional festivals specific to the individual villages, there are Bali-wide\
  \ festivals celebrated everywhere, there are festivals for each God, and every Balinese\
  \ person has one particular god that is their patron, so they celebrate on that\
  \ feast day too. \n\nI was lucky, Ni Made told me. I would be in Bali for one of\
  \ the village\u2019s most important festivals \u2013 held only every ten years,\
  \ to honour the dead. As we passed the massive temple every evening on our way home,\
  \ we heard the drums beating, the hum of musical instruments and the rising, rhythmic\
  \ voices of the Balinese singers. \n\nEvery day we saw more and more wooden figurines\
  \ arriving at the central meeting point in the village. Here, the processions for\
  \ the festival would start, we were told. Each of the figurines represented a different\
  \ family from the village \u2013 the families would come, jump around and follow\
  \ the figurines as they travelled from the central point to the festival site, where\
  \ they would be burned as offerings to the gods. \n\nIn times gone by, Ni Made told\
  \ me, the figurines would contain the actual remains of the dead from each family.\
  \ Now, however, the figurines contained tributes symbolising each family member\
  \ instead \u2013 a treasured object or toy perhaps.\n\nThen, the day before the\
  \ festival, she told us she wouldn\u2019t be attending. \n\n\u201CIt is my blood\
  \ time,\u201D she said. \u201CI am unclean. I cannot go.\u201D \n\nWe tried reasoning\
  \ with her. After all her hard work? Surely she had to go! But she shook her head,\
  \ sadly. \n\n\u201CIt is my religion,\u201D she said.  \n\nWe were told that if\
  \ we had our periods, we too should respect the Balinese customs and not go to the\
  \ festival. Out of almost 60 Western women, only two stayed at home."
