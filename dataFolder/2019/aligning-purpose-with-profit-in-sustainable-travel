Text: "The year was 2010, and we were walking a beach in Palawan, Philippines, that\
  \ was only shared by a nesting sea turtle and clownfish in the offshore reef. It\
  \ was paradise like we'd never seen before. And importantly, rarely seen online\
  \ before either. A gravel road (now paved) linked the sleepy fishing village of\
  \ El Nido to the rest of the modern world and it made for a very bumpy ride in.\
  \ \n\nI bent down and picked up a plastic water bottle that had a bunch of Thai\
  \ writing on it. I thought how cool it was that this bottle had floated all the\
  \ way over from Thailand! My thoughts now on that bottle are very different. \n\n\
  In the same year, I rode two elephants in Thailand - 'what an experience!' I thought\
  \ back then, trekking through the jungle high up while this gentle giant showed\
  \ us its backyard. My thoughts now on those elephant rides are very different. \n\
  \nAnd on the same trip, while walking the streets of Hong Kong, we saw shark fin\
  \ soup for sale on the streets. Although I didn't try it, my friend did and literally\
  \ nothing out of the ordinary crossed my mind. My thoughts now on that streetside\
  \ soup are very different. \n\nFast-forward nine years, and I now am the founder\
  \ of a sustainable travel content hub, www.ecoescapetravel.com, and only align my\
  \ travels, writing, photography, and filmmaking with purpose-driven sustainable\
  \ tourism. My experiences back then linked up with my educated mind now helped me\
  \ understand my role and duties as a traveller and industry professional. Those\
  \ experiences, and one professor. \n\nAfter that trip in 2010, I enrolled in Toursim\
  \ Management at university in my home country of Canada. While studying, I had the\
  \ opportunity to participate in an agro-tourism project in Costa Rica with the Rainforest\
  \ Alliance and my university. This ultimately was a turning point in my studies\
  \ and future career and I knew that anything I did needed to align with purpose\
  \ and sustainability. \n\nMy level of oblivion was admirable as I was a 19-year-old\
  \ backpacker in South East Asia. I now understand the importance of aligning purpose\
  \ with profit for a sustainable future in travel. With tourism hitting an expected\
  \ 2 billion people by 2021, the industry needs to work with communities, environment,\
  \ and culture to ensure a sustainable future, and so the industry doesn't collapse\
  \ under its own weight. \n\nStorytelling and content have an opportunity to work\
  \ these subtle educational tips in so young and old travellers also understand how\
  \ they can do their part, and digital media is the biggest influence of that. \n\
  \nVideo, photography, and writing are sitting on a content goldmine to make travel\
  \ the next plastic-straw free movement. Continuously aligning written travel storytelling\
  \ with purpose will encourage a sustainable future for travellers, communities,\
  \ and destinations worldwide."
