Text: "It's the beginning of a new day, the sunlights come through the window, the\
  \ alarm sounds with the same annoying ringtone as always, and once again, you have\
  \ to come back to your routine, your daily life. Shower, breakfast, school, job,\
  \ same people, same talks, same feelings and emotions\u2026 but you are not satisfied,\
  \ you need something more, you need that sparkle to Iive.\n\nSo... the life gives\
  \ you your turn to change the air. Maybe an erasmus year, internship abroad, volunteering\
  \ program or a simple trip. What a better thing to scape from everything than travel?\
  \ Why not? (Even better nowadays that it became the new social currency from millennials).\n\
  \nFinally, you are there. Enjoying the wonderful life with no responsibilities,\
  \ no regrets, no fears, no limits. But you perfectly know that these is not you\
  \ really, right? These is not your home and these is not part of your routine. \n\
  \nAnyway, you are learning a lot from the travel encyclopedia: sense of locations,\
  \ resilience, limits, empathy, patience, confidence, self-trust, and the list goes\
  \ on and on...\n\nBecause only when you are far away from home you realize some\
  \ life lessons to feed your sense of belonging, the inspiration of your life and\
  \ motivation to move forward. That is, exactly, the travel-break even point, when\
  \ you are empowered to conquer the world, which is not high enough to get known\
  \ and where the limits don\u2019t exist. The point where you are cheerful and fearless\
  \ as f*ck. \n\nThen you come back... Home, sweet home!\n\nIt's the beginning of\
  \ a new day, the sunlights come through the window, the alarm sounds with the same\
  \ annoying ringtone as always, and once again, you have to come back to your routine,\
  \ your daily life. Shower, breakfast, school, job, same people, same talks, same\
  \ feelings and emotions\u2026 but you are not satisfied, you need something more,\
  \ you need that sparkle to Iive.\n\n\nSo... Who you really are when you travel?\n\
  \n\n\nMastering the art of travel give the most precious gifts in life, the best\
  \ memories, the best friends and the best landscapes that any photo can assimilate\
  \ it. It gives you the maturity to accept your reality and to make realities wherever\
  \ I go. Because you decide your own destiny. Because you are your own teacher. \
  \ Because the world is your home. Because your home is where your heart go. \n\n\
  For all the chances that you have, for all the people that you know, for all the\
  \ places you have been, for all your failed attempts to speak french, spanish, chinese\
  \ or any language, for all the cities that are gonna keep many stories and for the\
  \ coincidences converted in the best experiences of our lives.\n\nTake a moment\
  \ to thanks for all the opportunities that you take, all the people that you know\
  \ and all the places you have been. THANKS TO THE WORLD! THANKS TO YOUR HOME!\n\n\
