Text: "We drive slowly through the dense bush. The old troopy bounces along the bushwhacked\
  \ track while next to me on worn bench seats the girls \u2013 four of them aged\
  \ seven to eleven \u2013 chatter and heckle the driver. \n\n\u201CDo ya even have\
  \ ya licence miss?\u201D says the youngest.\n\n\u201CI reckon I\u2019m a better\
  \ driver than you miss!\u201D from the middle.\n\nRebecca navigates these untended\
  \ tracks with confidence. She has been living in the small Aboriginal community\
  \ of Woolah, hidden off the highway in Doon Doon Station, since taking the Principal\u2019\
  s job at Dawul Remote Community School. \n\nMy first visit to Doon Doon is for only\
  \ a day with a small group of guest science teachers.\n\nSunset is around two hours\
  \ away. Dappled light breaks through woolybutt, ironwood and the medley of eucalypts\
  \ as the sun dips towards a high and distant ridge. A disused and decaying wooden\
  \ cattle ramp appears, out of place among overgrown spinifex and colourful native\
  \ shrubs. \n\n\u201CThe edge of the property used to reach here until the cattle\
  \ station moved closer to the highway,\u201D Rebecca explains. \u201CThis whole\
  \ place used to look totally different. The bush has done a great job of growing\
  \ back after the cattle were moved on.\u201D\n\nThe troopy crosses a dry creek bed\
  \ lined with tall thin natives, thirsty in the dry heat. When the monsoon rains\
  \ come this creek will flood and the trees will store what they need. \n\nAs we\
  \ near the river the girls clamber over us excitedly and have the doors open before\
  \ Rebecca can kill the engine. On foot we navigate over large rocks and down a steep\
  \ sandy bank to reach an exposed section of river bed. \n\nJaloorr-mageny, monsoon\
  \ season, ended months ago but the river still flows several feet deep in the middle.\
  \ The girls romp in the natural playground formed by exposed boulders with lines\
  \ that show where the river swells, some over our heads.\n\nOne of the girls appears\
  \ holding a stone.  \u201CReckon I can hit the other side?\u201D\n\n\u201CGo on\
  \ then\u201D says the eldest, searching for her own stone.\n\nThey giggle as the\
  \ throw falls well short of the plump pandanus roots dangling from the far bank.\
  \ The next throw bounces with a clack off a protruding rock. All four have another\
  \ turn each, the youngest almost falling in the river. \n\nThey tell me how the\
  \ pandanus roots are strong enough to climb if they do fall in.\n\nWhile we throw\
  \ and skip rocks I ask the girls about their favourite part of today\u2019s science\
  \ lesson.\n\n\u201CThe gravity game\u201D says the youngest, remembering when we\
  \ launched a tennis ball off a rainbow parachute. \n\n\u201CI liked the rockets\u201D\
  \ says another because her balloon-rocket flew furthest. \n\nThe older girl stays\
  \ quiet so I ask if she likes science at school. She shrugs and fidgets with a rock.\
  \ From behind me Rebecca says: \u201CI told these mob you girls knew a lot about\
  \ the night sky. They can\u2019t see a lot of stars down in Perth, there\u2019s\
  \ too much other light.\u201D\n\nAt this the older girl\u2019s face brightens and\
  \ turns to the pale late afternoon sky, a few thin clouds promising good stars tonight.\n\
  \nShe tells me about the Emu that lives in a dark patch between stars in our Milky\
  \ Way, to its south the Kangaroo. How their ancestors knew when the three seasons\
  \ and eight seasonal stages were changing based on where these figures were.\n\n\
  How everyone is born into a totem animal or plant; taught the Dreamtime stories,\
  \ the ways it shaped their land.\n\nThis is all new to me.\n\nSonglines carrying\
  \ more than forty thousand years of scientific observations and cultural wisdom\
  \ are disappearing with a dwindling population of Jarrakan speakers.\n\nThis is\
  \ a place tamed and respected by a culture more ancient than even the oldest of\
  \ my European ancestors. \n\nEventually we pile back into the troopy, the girls\
  \ play fighting with sticks for a few minutes first. \n\nThrough the rear window\
  \ the sun is setting behind the ridge, bathing the bush in fiery deep oranges and\
  \ pinks. The girls are quiet, nodding with tired as we bump and jostle our way back\
  \ to the gravel road of Doon Doon."
