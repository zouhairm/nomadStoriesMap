Text: "Bhutan, the land of serenity, could be a fully completely different world altogether.\
  \ Far away from the garishness and glamour of the fashionable society, it's a land\
  \ of sensitive those that love their culture. Being the sole country that measures\
  \ its progress in GNH (Gross National Happiness), it offers a contemporary perspective\
  \ on the way to develop while not polluting it\u2019s ecological and cultural heritage.\n\
  \nBhutan has its own holistic set values for development, which is not about how\
  \ rich can they get but rather how happy can they be. Even while taking census government\
  \ has included the question \u201Care you happy?\u201D For the Bhutanese, milestones\
  \ achieved have been equality, almost zero crime rate, and development of local\
  \ schools, healthcare centres and many more. Which have always proven to have a\
  \ vision towards improving the quality of life rather than quantitative measures\
  \ such as how wealthy their economy is.\n\nWhenever we tend to visit a place; we\
  \ tend to simply don\u2019t soak within the physical and technical aspects of the\
  \ place however additionally the metaphysical aspects. There area unit things one\
  \ cannot learn from the web or from referring books, however, ought to be knowledgeable\
  \ about an experience to totally soak it in. Thus to understand Bhutan, it's necessary\
  \ to experience it. Experiencing Bhutan has definitely raised several questions\
  \ while simultaneously answering many. \n\nThe country\_that\_hasn\u2019t\_however\_\
  fallen prey to cultural\_restoration\_includes a\_heap\_to supply. Here it is not\
  \ just about visiting, but also learn about how the people over there have maintained\
  \ the style of living from the past till now. In this fast-paced world where things\
  \ change drastically in the blink of an eye, Bhutan has helped us learn how one\
  \ can have a progressive mind while being true to one\u2019s culture. People over\
  \ there have a sense of responsibility,\_for them the technological advances of\
  \ the \u201Cmodern world\u201D\_square measure\_to boost\_farming techniques and\_\
  care\_facilities. In no\_approach, they need\_to be compromised in their culture.\
  \ Here the culture and tradition\_simply\_don't\_stay\_to be followed on special\
  \ occasions\_however\_rather as\_the simplest way\_of life\_that\_explains their\
  \ open minds to varied\_concepts. They have their roots deep and wings\_robust\_\
  to soar high. We all\_should\_have introspected at\_your time\_of\_however\_the\
  \ political agendas, economy\_and style\_weave\_along to take care of\_the culture\
  \ and\_do not\_erase it from the memory of the place;\_Bhutan is a\_robust\_example\
  \ for\_a similar. \n\n\nVisiting Bhutan is entering a different world altogether,\
  \ a world proud of its own self, a world from\_which we all can learn from."
