Text: "I was born in Addis Ababa and left the country when I was twelve years old.\
  \ I returned for the first time after twenty eight years. When I left he country\
  \ it was under very difficult circumstances. The country was under communist rule\
  \ and every move you made was monitored.  When the plane landed at Bole internet\
  \ airport in Addis Ababa it was a nerve wracking moment . Once I got through immigration\
  \ I started noticing the familiar passive aggressiveness of the airport porters\
  \ . Once getting my bags I noticed my uncle waving to me he had obtained a special\
  \ permit to come into the airport to greet me. I waived excitedly to him and ran\
  \ to hug him . He said he had a taxi waiting outside . The taxi was the blue and\
  \ white fiat that I remember from my childhood. The young cabdriver was excited\
  \ to get this fair and helped us load my luggage. The sky was a perfect shade of\
  \ blue and the temperature was mild and pleasant. Once we exited the airport parking\
  \ lot I noticed donkeys and herds of sheep, literally pushing past the taxi we were\
  \ in.  There were young boys referred locally as \u201Clistros\u201D wearing shabby\
  \ shorts and T-shirt\u2019s anxiously looking for their next customer who wanted\
  \ their shoes polished. \nA few miles down the road the streets were lined with\
  \ women wearing their traditional garb with little piles of potatoes, onions, jalape\xF1\
  os and various spices for sale. The women chatted idley amongst themselves and had\
  \ their hands on their forheads meant to shield them from the sun. There were cafes\
  \ with outdoor tables up and down the road . I asked my uncle if we could pull over\
  \ and get a macchiatto from a childhood spot named Flamingo conveniently located\
  \ at the end of the road before reaching Mesmel square.  This place was unique because\
  \ the waiters would come to your car to take your Order and actually bring your\
  \ order to you on a tray to your car. We stopped and ordered three macchiatos and\
  \ my uncle specified that he wanted his \u201Ctekor yale\u201D which translates\
  \ to \u201Con the darker side\u201D . Simply put he preferred his macchiato with\
  \ more espresso than milk.  I asked if they had a Bomboloni as the last time u had\
  \ one of those delicious pastries was when I was a child. To my delight the waiter\
  \ said they did and if preferred it with pastry cream or Marmalata . I opted for\
  \ the pastry cream one. \nWithin minutes 3 machiattos and one Bomboloni arrived.\
  \ The macchiato was creamy rich and perfect in every way. Served in a short glass\
  \ cup one could see the layers of the espresso, mild and froth.\nThe taxi driver\
  \ and my uncle were quick in drinking their macchiatos and I took my time savoring\
  \ mine. As I had slept on the plane I wasn\u2019t tired. After paying our waiter,\
  \ we drove through Meskel square and past the ECA on the right and Jubilee Palace\
  \ on the left. The street was divided in a way that traffic going up was in the\
  \ left and traffic coming down was on the right.  In between these two avenues was\
  \ a park with a huge statue of Vladimir Lenin gesturing as though he was making\
  \ a speech. This statue evoked a lot of feeling for me , I resorted to that child\
  \ that was fearful of communism and the mere mention of Lenin would terrify me.\
  \ But that is a whole other story. We proceeded through the traffic light and went\
  \ up the hill past the Hilton Hotel a popular destination in Addis and a hangout\
  \ for the elite.  Designed in unique traditional architectural style it was definitely\
  \ one of the best places for tourists and locals ( those who could afford it ) would\
  \ go for various activities.  The pool was especially unique as it was shaped in\
  \ a traditional Ethiopian cross and to top it off it was heated. If I\u2019m not\
  \ mistaken this was the only heated pool in Addis at the time.  I had made reservations\
  \ for a single room for myself as I didn\u2019t want to be a burden to my uncle\
  \ and his large family."
