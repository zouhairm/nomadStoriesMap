Text: "Leaving or not starting? An important part of the world youth community is\
  \ divided on this question of Shakespearian appearance. Personally I am on the side\
  \ of all those who have opted for the first choice. Of course, nothing against those\
  \ who choose to stay. Both are decisions that require the individual a certain amount\
  \ of courage.\nDespite the interest in an experience abroad, for many people it\
  \ could be equated to make a leap into the darkness. In that case, I recommend taking\
  \ a long run and throwing yourself in the air! I do not deny the presence of darkness,\
  \ but I guarantee that it could only be in the head of the individual. As the experience\
  \ is lived, knowledge illuminates the things of the new world that is being explored,\
  \ removing objects, faces, identities and languages \u200B\u200Bfrom the darkness\
  \ and the unknown. Little by little a dimension until then completely unexplored\
  \ looms in the mind of the adventurer. At this point, it does not matter if this\
  \ new reality is better or worse than the original one, what matters now is the\
  \ pure knowledge of things, be it conducted for mere survival or out of pure love\
  \ of knowledge. Everything is questioned starting with oneself and one's own choice.\
  \ One wonders what the real reason for the departure is: has the journey been undertaken\
  \ in the perspective of a better life or in search of novelty?\nLet's jump back\
  \ and try to tackle the main problem with departure: how can I leave? For those\
  \ who want it there are many opportunities to leave, the main ones being offered\
  \ by volunteer camps, seasonal jobs and, for students, by Erasmus projects. My travel\
  \ story begins with the participation in an EVS (European Volunteering Service):\
  \ by taking part in this project we leave alone, without actually being one. The\
  \ association of the country of origin, which I later referred to as the base organization,\
  \ works in harmony with the foreign host association, which I will call the host\
  \ organization. While the former acts as an intermediary and mediator, the latter\
  \ is the true creator of the project to which she adheres and takes charge of its\
  \ realization on site. As for my adventure, I took part in a two-month EVS entitled\
  \ Come as you are, published by the Scambieuropei association from Bologna and proposed\
  \ by Epeka, a Turkish organization host active on the disability front. Getting\
  \ used to new situations, learning to relate to the local community and demonstrating\
  \ one's skills is certainly not easy. It requires humility, a desire to learn, a\
  \ predisposition towards others, the ability to get involved without being overwhelmed\
  \ by difficulties as well as a certain amount of diplomacy. All seasoned with holy\
  \ patience. It is common to have the feeling of having to start all over again and\
  \ it is easy to run the risk of being discouraged by obstacles and complexity. It\
  \ is an activity that can present both difficulties and facilitations. For example,\
  \ it can facilitate linguistic and cultural learning, increase the ability to communicate\
  \ and social relations, also increasing enthusiasm and the desire to do. With the\
  \ journey we learn along the way: it is an experience that therefore leaves room\
  \ for the traveler's learning and personal growth and they have been useful to grow\
  \ even the negative facts. I therefore advise you not to be afraid of difficult\
  \ or hindering situations that may be encountered during the course of the service.\
  \ On the contrary, it is necessary to take them into account before leaving and\
  \ obtain antibodies to best address them. Basically - relatives and teachers have\
  \ always told us - the difficulties strengthen the personality and make the experience\
  \ more valid."
