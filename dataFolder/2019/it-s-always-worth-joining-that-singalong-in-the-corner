Text: "I didn\u2019t expect to find myself carrying a symbolic gift to my own country\u2019\
  s consulate to the top of one of the Caucasus\u2019 highest mountains. \n\nI\u2019\
  ve never considered myself patriotic. Don\u2019t get me wrong, I\u2019m grateful\
  \ to come from a country that gave me easy access to education and clean water.\
  \ The longer I\u2019ve lived abroad, even in countries like England and New Zealand,\
  \ the more I\u2019ve come to appreciate growing up in Canada, where bathroom faucets\
  \ have adjustable temperatures and houses are insulated. But I\u2019m uncomfortable\
  \ with Canada\u2019s colonial history. I\u2019ve never stitched a Canadian flag\
  \ to my backpack or had a maple leaf tattooed.  So I have to say it felt strange\
  \ to be standing jelly-legged in the blinding sun at the peak of Mount Kazbek, holding\
  \ a flag commemorating twenty-five years of Canadian-Georgian diplomacy.\n\nMind\
  \ you, it was a trip full of the unexpected. I hadn\u2019t expected the van we\u2019\
  d bought in Russia, where my husband grew up, to require two weeks of repairs before\
  \ we could even begin building a bed and kitchen inside it. I hadn\u2019t expected\
  \ to finish building said interior only three days before my Russian visa expired,\
  \ leaving us just seventy-two hours to drive from the Moscow region to the Georgian\
  \ border. And I especially hadn\u2019t expected our fuel pump to break while we\
  \ were parked in the border queue, a mess that began with everyone behind us having\
  \ to back up and help us push the van to the side and escalated to my husband fixing\
  \ the fuel pump while I, panicking about overstaying and never being allowed back\
  \ to see my in-laws, hitched across the border only to discover on the other side\
  \ that I had no money or phone service.\n\nWe\u2019d never climbed a mountain before,\
  \ but after everything that came before it, the journey up Kazbek almost felt like\
  \ a rest. \n\nAlmost. It was, of course, exhausting. We were exhausted to start\
  \ with. We\u2019d spent one day below the mountain in Stepantsminda, gorging ourselves\
  \ on hearty stews, tomatoes a thousand times more red and ripe than any ever seen\
  \ in a North American supermarket, and hachapouri \u2013 hot, cheesy flatbreads\
  \ wrapped around fried eggs. We\u2019d slept in a campground where horses grazed\
  \ among the vans. And then we\u2019d begun the climb, lugging a tent and three days\u2019\
  \ worth of food.\n\nWhen we arrived at the disused weather station where climbers\
  \ acclimatize to the altitude, all I wanted to do was sleep. I was lying in the\
  \ tent before the sun even set. \n\nAnd then my husband came in and said, \u201C\
  There are Russians inside playing guitar!\u201D\n\nMy husband never instigates anything\
  \ social. I drag him out \u2013 to dinner, to drinks, to people\u2019s houses. It\
  \ seemed mean to back out when he finally wanted to party. \n\nSo we went inside.\
  \ The weather station was a cold concrete building without plumbing. People in down\
  \ jackets cooked on gas stoves, and sure enough, a big group was singing and drinking.\
  \ Otkuda? they asked us. Where are you from? My husband said Russia, and half the\
  \ room nodded. I said Canada, and they got weirdly excited.\n\nI\u2019d received\
  \ warm receptions as a Canadian tourist before. And, okay, the signatures covering\
  \ the walls showed that Kazbek\u2019s visitors are usually Polish, Ukrainian, Estonian\
  \ \u2013 Canadians here were rare. But this reaction was still absurd. My Russian\
  \ isn\u2019t fluent, and with so many people talking animatedly I couldn\u2019t\
  \ follow why this was such a big deal. And then a man in a yellow parka introduced\
  \ himself as Ilya and explained that our countries were about to celebrate twenty-five\
  \ years of diplomacy. He would be climbing to the peak alongside us, carrying a\
  \ ceremonial flag.  \nWould I hold one end for the photo?\n\nWe left early the next\
  \ morning \u2013 two am, so as to make it to the peak by noon. Ilya\u2019s party\
  \ included an older man who had to turn back, so I ended up carrying the flag myself,\
  \ posing proudly for the photo with our Georgian guide. The flag made it to the\
  \ ceremony and I made some lasting friends. \n\nHave you ever gone to bed early\
  \ on holiday? Imagine what you might have missed..."
