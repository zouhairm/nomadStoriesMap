Text: "In the summer of 2017 I took a trip to visit my brother in Japan. Buying a\
  \ Japan rail pass in advance to travel across the country, dreams were a common\
  \ theme of my trip to as I watched the rain drops scatter along the windows of the\
  \ Shinkansen, stretched out in long globules as they shot off into the night below\
  \ as I glided along the rails of those high speed trains, or watched the spinning\
  \ water wheel of Kurosawa\u2019s Village of the Watermills beyond the sprawling\
  \ Wasabe fields of the hidden Gem of Azumino where I nearly touched the clouds of\
  \ Nagano\u2019s mystic mountains. Yet, I wouldn\u2019t come to know the true meaning\
  \ of dreams until I reached Sakurajima, a small island off the coast of Kagoshima,\
  \ a city near the southern most point of Kyushu. \n\nSakurajima is home to an active\
  \ volcano and towards the end of my time on this amazing island full of monasteries\
  \ and hot springs I took the second last bus to the island\u2019s lava viewing area.\
  \ When I got there, stepping off the bus and not knowing what to expect, I immediately\
  \ felt the ground rumbling as a deep, unsettling feeling came over me. Looking up\
  \ at the volcano I heard the loud gurgles and hisses of combusting materials. The\
  \ Fury of Nature read a sign after I climbed the steps to an elevated platform where\
  \ I could watch the volcano spew out ash, hissing menacingly at the world below.\
  \ Apparently, the whole town had gone up in smoke half a decade before, villagers\
  \ running for their lives as everything they\u2019d ever known went up in smoke.\
  \ Reading this and feeling the shaking ground at my feet, tears came to my eyes\
  \ as I bowed down to the mountain before me, suddenly aware of how insignificant\
  \ I was, in awe at this one facet of nature that might incinerate me in an instant.\
  \ \n\nThe next day I took a ferry to Yakushima, another island full of old growth\
  \ forest, with trees as old as Gilgamesh, and deer, sea turtles and monkeys that\
  \ seemed to have grown accustomed to tourists, not even flinching when you went\
  \ right up to them. I was set to meet my brother there and on our first day we took\
  \ a swim in a large river, with waters that trickled down from the mountains above\
  \ it. I told him about the volcano, about everything I\u2019d experienced, and the\
  \ thoughts I\u2019d had on the ferry on the way over.\n\n\u201CYou know I\u2019\
  ve been having a lot of thoughts lately about the possibility of the ending of our\
  \ species,\u201D I told him as we waded into the water, and took each others hands,\
  \ beginning to circle around each other playfully \u201Cand it\u2019s the first\
  \ time I\u2019ve ever felt okay with the possibility. What I couldn\u2019t help\
  \ thinking was that most of our lives we go around thinking that when we go to bed\
  \ our brains create our dreams in our sleep, but this time I couldn\u2019t help\
  \ thinking that it\u2019s not our brains that create our dreams it\u2019s the other\
  \ way around. It\u2019s our dreams that create the world around us.\u201D\n\n\u201C\
  It\u2019s funny,\u201D he told me,\u201CI didn\u2019t think you\u2019d catch on\
  \ so quick, but I had the same feeling when I first came here. Welcome to Japan!\u201D\
  \ \n\nReaching his hounds out towards me I gripped onto his and we we began to circle\
  \ around each other, laughing playfully in the water as the distance between us\
  \ began to dissipate as if we had begun to forget which one of us was which, or\
  \ as if looking down upon ourselves from the mountains above, as if in a dream."
