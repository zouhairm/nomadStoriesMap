Text: "The moment my nostrils inhaled the air of Mumbai, I Knew I was about to start\
  \ a love affair with India. I quickly deleted the App Weather since it kept telling\
  \ me that Mumbai is all about \u201Cunhealthy air quality\u201D, unable to tell\
  \ that there is life in that \u201Cunhealthy air\u201D. A few minutes later, my\
  \ very sensitive nose started bleeding but I ignored it. Tissues did the job. \u201C\
  It\u2019s all part of the adventure\u201D, I kept telling myself.\n\nThe encounter\
  \ wasn\u2019t great though, for I soon discovered that my bag went missing after\
  \ a delayed connecting flight. You guessed it right, \u201Cit\u2019s all part of\
  \ the adventure\u201D. Anything could fit under this category whenever I am traveling.\
  \ It was the rule I followed when I was lost in the middle of nowhere in the English\
  \ countryside. The same rule empowered me when I was in the borders between France,\
  \ Germany and Luxembourg, trying to find my way while crying by the bank of the\
  \ Moselle River. Tissues did the job. That rule did not comfort me as much as it\
  \ made me enjoy being confused and yearn for more adventures to come my way. That\
  \ is exactly why I chose to embark on a road trip around Mumbai right after I left\
  \ the airport at dawn, instead of opting to get some rest in the hostel. I was \u201C\
  bag-less\u201D anyway, which made it easier for me to go around the city. \n\nFatigue\
  \ eventually goes away but funny memories remain. However, fatigue always makes\
  \ sure to stick around for some time. After a busy day of exploring and eating delicious\
  \ food that my stomach was not familiar with, I joined my group and we set off towards\
  \ Panchgani on a 7-hour journey. I was actually part of the Caux Scholars Program,\
  \ an academic program on peace building organized by the Initiatives of Change Foundation.\
  \ It was a fantastic program, but its best part was not the academic one. It was\
  \ the fact that it forced me to experience borrowing pyjamas from a stranger once\
  \ we reached the center at night after vomiting on the only clothes I had during\
  \ the bus trip. Tissues did the job. It was also all the songs, the inside jokes\
  \ and the meetings over meals.\n\nOne of these meetings was with Rajmohan Gandhi,\
  \ the grandson of Mahatma Gandhi. It was extremely insightful. However, the moments\
  \ I shared with one little girl in the remote village of Bichukule weren\u2019t\
  \ less interesting, even though we only spoke in sign language while enjoying the\
  \ temple music and building stone fences in the fields. We will forever be kept\
  \ in each others\u2019 memories for we marked each others\u2019 first day of the\
  \ New Year.\nOn that eve, I made sure not only to stay up for fireworks but also\
  \ for the first dawn of the year after an exciting hike up to the majestic Asia\
  \ Plateau in Panchgani. It reminded me of the hike I had in Switzerland up to the\
  \ Swiss Alps to enjoy the sunrise. It seems that I\u2019m always chasing sunrises\
  \ everywhere in the globe.\n\nContemplating the Plateau from above that morning\
  \ made me think of those who feel forced to post their \u201Cnew year\u2019s resolutions\u201D\
  \ online just because everyone else does. Basking at the early thin layers of the\
  \ sun made me feel that growth is not really about constant change but rather about\
  \ sticking to one\u2019s values in this crazy world. This is what my grandmother\
  \ taught me. She was an illiterate woman but a peace advocate. I am proud that I\
  \ shared her story in front of activists from around the world while her picture\
  \ was supporting my back. It was emotional, but tissues did the job.\n\nI still\
  \ recall very vividly my eagerness to translate all my emotions into words while\
  \ documenting my trip on Instagram. I wouldn\u2019t just post a picture with an\
  \ emoji. A picture is for capturing the moment, but a short reflection attached\
  \ to that picture could add life to the lifeless. This is my way to get familiarized\
  \ with the unknown, and to turn any wild experience into a unique memory to cherish\
  \ for a life time."
