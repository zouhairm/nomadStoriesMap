Text: "I am an aquatic creature and for me to think of an island has always been synonymous\
  \ with paradise. I did not like that Laos did not have sea but I was happy to discover\
  \ that in Laos there was a place, apparently paradisiacal, which they called the\
  \ 4000 islands; They are located in the south of the country and very close to the\
  \ border with Cambodia. Si Phan Don is an area of \u200B\u200Bislands located in\
  \ the Mekong, also known as the Laos beach. The most important islands are Don Khong,\
  \ Don Det, and Don Khon, these last two are linked by a bridge and are well known\
  \ in the backpacker and traveler environment.\nFrom the moment I learned of its\
  \ existence, I began to investigate and I was already dreaming of this part of the\
  \ trip in a natural and almost wild place located in the middle of the Mekong; ideal\
  \ to rest, disconnect from the world and relax walking between paddies and contemplating\
  \ the sunsets ...\nFrom Pakse we travel in a van; approximately three hours by road\
  \ to the village of Ban Nakasang. The pier is about a hundred meters from the bus\
  \ station and rows of food shops, bars etc. are appearing along the way. In the\
  \ background, there is a ticket office where you can buy the boat tickets and for\
  \ less than one euro you can get on the boat that will take you to the chosen island.\
  \ \n\nArriving at the islands is already a pretty adventure; navigate in a narrow\
  \ and colorful boat that crosses part of the Mekong to go to the jetty of Don Det,\
  \ our chosen island. When you get closer to the jetty you start to see the palm\
  \ trees and the huts built on stilts on the banks of the river ... When you get\
  \ off the boat, you come across a road flanked by bars, restaurants, tourist agencies,\
  \ and small shops ... 4000 islands do not lack anything! Well, sometimes the light\
  \ goes out! But that's normal, and it always comes back!  There are hot water and\
  \ wifi ... I expected them to be wilder, but with all that, the islands are perfect\
  \ for disconnecting.\n\nWe chose Don Det because we had read that it was the quietest\
  \ and the most backpacking environment, for being the wildest. When we arrived,\
  \ we had to choose the accommodation; It was low season and they gave us the best\
  \ prices but in some, the wood on the walls was too far apart and mosquitoes could\
  \ enter (In this area there is dengue and malaria) In others there were only double\
  \ beds or there was no place to all ...After visiting several lodgings, we saw some\
  \ beautiful bungalows and went to ask there and a man with no sense of being Laotian\
  \ began to tell us about the wonders of the place ... He told us that this was the\
  \ best lodging he had found on the whole island and that also the restaurant was\
  \ great. That man was Dutch and had been staying at Don Det for 5 months ... That's\
  \ how we met the Flying Dutchman!\n\nThe truth is that the Dutchman was right and\
  \ we could not have chosen better accommodation! The bungalows were superb and the\
  \ restaurant was terrific ... The family that ran the business became our family\
  \ in Laos;  the lady cooked great; she washed our clothes and was aware of every\
  \ detail. The day we arrived She bought Nutella to make pancakes ... the biggest\
  \ and richest pancakes I've ever seen! And the rest of her family was super friendly!\
  \ They had a grandmother who did not understand anything we said but she greeted\
  \ us and smiled. She was lovely!  I remember that one day Stephanie asked for the\
  \ dinner bill and told her: The bill? and she came out with a beer! \nThat day we\
  \ settled down, went to see the surroundings and then we went to the jetty to see\
  \ the sunset.\n\n\_The place where you can see the best sunset, that night was just\
  \ for us! And while it sounded I do not know what background music ... we contemplated\
  \ the sunset while we talked about our traveling adventures."
