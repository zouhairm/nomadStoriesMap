Text: "I have been to many places in Europe, then why am I writing about Bali ? When\
  \ we visit Europe we are well aware of the beautiful continent and the culture and\
  \ prosperity there. But Bali was a total surprise package for me. I visited Bali\
  \ 3 yrs back, when Bali was not even on the map for Indian tourists. The first ever\
  \ picture I saw of Bali was of Ulun danu Bratan! I was taken aback by this serene\
  \ beauty sitting in holy water lake. And when I searched about it, I was in for\
  \ a surprise to find out, it was a Hindu temple! Being a Indian Hindu by religion,\
  \ I never expected to find such a huge hindu religion followership in country which\
  \ has a dominant Muslim religion. \nBali is mostly flocked by Australians and Japanese\
  \ tourists. For most of the people it's a leisure honeymoon destination and for\
  \ others it's a beach vacation. But Bali has more to it. Very few places are touristy\
  \ and still have substance to it. Bali is not only offers turquoise ocean but also\
  \ culture and heritage. It is best of both worlds. Although being orthodox Hindu\
  \ by religion, Bali has gauged it's potential as a beautiful vacation spot and has\
  \ adopted itself according to that. Best time to visit Bali according to me is just\
  \ after the wet season is over or you can take a chance in wet season too! It is\
  \ beautiful all year round. \nPlaces like Goa gajah, ulun danu, batwan temple bring\
  \ u so close to their existence. Locals in Bali take pride in their religion and\
  \ respect it. I think, this emotional attachment towards one religion keeps them\
  \ United. I didn't expect to find such beautiful potrayal of a religion in such\
  \ a small place. To me Bali is so different than Indonesia and even other places\
  \ in the world. Place which is inconspicuous on the map and in world economy, still\
  \ shows immense richness. Being from a Hindu dominated country I felt less of a\
  \ Hindu in Bali when I saw their faith and respect for their culture and heritage.\
  \ Beaches are beautiful, villages are even more beautiful, but what is surprising\
  \ is the faith!  I didn't expect to find more of me in a land which was little known\
  \ to me!"
