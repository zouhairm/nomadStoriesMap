Text: "This autumn, a renewable engineering placement brought me into Colombia - a\
  \ fast developing latin country with conflicting history owing to Mr Escobar. I\
  \ thought it was only the culture difference I need to be prepared for, but the\
  \ land unfold its biodiverse geography to me in surprise.\n\nIn my first week when\
  \ settling down in the city of Medellin, sampling Colombian supremo coffee beans\
  \ and trying out salsa classes are the two must-do, and also became my first step\
  \ of learning Spanish from interacting with the locals. Music and the love for their\
  \ famous black liquid are infused in the blood of every Colombian, and slowly, it\
  \ becomes part of my life and I didn\u2019t realised how much I have missed these\
  \ two until departure.\n\nMaybe people would picture the country with gunfire in\
  \ the poor neighbourhood, drug manufacturing sites in the forest, lazy people on\
  \ the street and so on. True these, but they\u2019re becoming less common in the\
  \ society since the internal war ended 2 years ago. Nowadays, people take buses\
  \ to work where busker performs his/her new piece and merchants sell snacks & small\
  \ gadgets. 8am to 5pm is the standard working hour but hey, we\u2019re still in\
  \ Latin America so 3 breaks are expected during working hours: a break for morning\
  \ tea, a 2-hour break for lunch, and another break for afternoon tea is the standard\
  \ protocol. Work is important, but enjoying life is more important is the spirit\
  \ in the culture.\n\nDuring the 3 months working in Colombia, I flew out to Tatacoa\
  \ dessert which once was a fertile river valley before it dried out, and managed\
  \ to sell some of the solar panel my company works on to help sustain the basic\
  \ energy supply for tourist phone charging, lights at night etc. The desert itself\
  \ was impressive, would say it\u2019s the superposition of Cappadocia, Turkey and\
  \ Zhangye, China, but more importantly, I felt so sorry for what global warming\
  \ can do to a once lively happy land for many life forms.\n\nAnother unforgettable\
  \ destination would be the week in Amazon jungle, it is so primitive but amazing\
  \ at the same time. I have to confess, at one point, I couldn\u2019t tolerate the\
  \ 50+ mosquito bites on my legs and decided to take the first boat out of the wild\
  \ jungle in the morning, an indigenous man took me into the jungle and stopped at\
  \ a tree. He slit the tree skin open and asked me to put on the blood looking liquid\
  \ from that tree onto these mosquito bites. Suddenly, all the itchy feeling annoyed\
  \ my for hours all gone. That was the very second I\u2019m in awe of Mother Nature\
  \ - where the cause is, where the cure is too. Living in the heart of Amazon jungle\
  \ means I had to fish my own meal out of the world\u2019s longest river, and many\
  \ times, I had to have chicken-tasted piranha for dinner. I had the chance to go\
  \ into Ca\xF1os Cristales where the only place in the word creeks are filled with\
  \ groups and groups of red corals. Waking up witb bird singing and going to bed\
  \ with insects chirping, trying not to let hairy spiders and lethal but rainbow\
  \ frogs jump on me all the time and eating the fishes I\u2019ve never seen in my\
  \ life as daily meal,  there is no other eco-tour experience can be like this!\n\
  \nAnother highlight would be the weekend I spent in Cartagena de Indias, a place\
  \ was mistakenly considered as the land of India when Columbus first sailed across\
  \ the Atlantic. Local Palenqueras used to put up colourful traditional dress to\
  \ sell fresh fruit in shops and restaurants, this line of business has been transformed\
  \ by some American tourists giving generous tips after taking a photo with these\
  \ beautifully dressed business ladies. Nowadays, these ladies have become the walking\
  \ Colombian street artist who instantly charge $1 when a photo is taken.\n\nWhat\
  \ makes my Colombia so great is people always see the good things out of anything\
  \ and try to stay happy with family and friends, the country is an unbelievably\
  \ real beauty with so many geographical features, and the food is so unhealthy but\
  \ so good!"
