Text: "I would have never thought I would visit the western beaches of France, if\
  \ it wasn't for M. \nM. and I love to sit cross-legged on the couch and talk through\
  \ the night about the world, life and passions. On the one night we were sharing\
  \ our childhood holidays memories, he was so enthousiastic that he started drawing\
  \ maps and plans on scraps of paper, down on the living room table. \nBut that was\
  \ not enough: he wanted so much to be accurate that he decided to show me everything\
  \ on satellite view on his computer: the coast, the beaches he used to go find sea\
  \ shells and build sand castles, all the tiny islands with their names and their\
  \ lighthouses, and also the spots he used to go fishing or buy seafood directly\
  \ from the farm. \n\nIt was fascinating how many things he had to say about his\
  \ summers in Brittany. After telling me passionately about the celtic heritage,\
  \ the force of the natural elements, the tides, the traditional food and beverage\
  \ of Finist\xE8re - which comes from latin finis terrae and means \"the end of the\
  \ land\" - I was so charmed by both the beauty of the places he described and the\
  \ way his eyes were sparkling while talking. I had no doubt: I wanted to see that\
  \ place with my eyes, that End of the Land. So, I asked him to be my guide. \n\n\
  It was the end of November when we landed in Brest and the weather was as windy,\
  \ cold and moody as we expected, but while we were walking on the massive harbourside,\
  \ I had a strange feeling, like something was missing. I asked M. why Brest looked\
  \ so severe and where the city historical center was, because I couldn't see ancient\
  \ buildings anywhere. He told me that the city was strongly bombed during World\
  \ War II and that almost every building had to be rebuild. That both explained my\
  \ feeling and answered my questions. \n\nWe drove on our rented car to the countryside,\
  \ where M.'s grandparents' home was. They both died years ago and there was no one\
  \ there anymore. The old, tiny house was perched on the small hill, right in front\
  \ of a wild beach. From there, we could see and hear the ocean relentlessly swinging,\
  \ its salty smell carried to us by the wind. \"I used to wake up in the morning\
  \ to the waves and seagulls\",  M. told me, before showing me the small path we\
  \ had to take to walk down to the beach. \nThe tide was law and there was no one\
  \ except us - but at that time of the year, that was no surprise. Covered in our\
  \ coats, scarfs and whool hats, we walked towards the water on the fine grey sand\
  \ covered in seaweeds of all bizarre shapes. \n\"Come here and see!\", M. screamed\
  \ at me through the wind, as I walked through some piles of rocks left uncovered\
  \ by the low tide. Then, he looked at me smiling, and with both his hands, he raised\
  \ a wet rock from the floor, to discover a small green crab with bright red eyes\
  \ and said: \"I know these little ones very well! They are the angriest!\".\n\n\
  M. showed me breathtaking beaches made of sand, wind and massive rocks standing\
  \ proudly against the ocean, we could climb on them to watch all around, the water\
  \ on one side and the land covered with wild grass on the other. I was initiated\
  \ to the local cuisine, delicious cr\xEApes with caramel and buckwheat galettes,\
  \ apple cider and liquor, and tasty fish and seafood coming from the ocean have\
  \ delighted our meals.\n\nDays were short then, and when the sun came down to embrace\
  \ the ocean and disappear underwater, I noticed that unlike other places, Finist\xE8\
  re and its people respect darkness. With nothing but the stars and the lighthouses\
  \ to spark a little light in the bay, the ocean and the sky were united in a mystical\
  \ beauty, the same that I saw sparkling in M's black eyes, when he first told me\
  \ about this place? It is the magic of the End of the Land."
