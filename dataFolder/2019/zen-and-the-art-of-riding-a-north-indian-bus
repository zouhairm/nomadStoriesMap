Text: "I will always remember the terror that characterised my maiden voyage on an\
  \ Indian bus. My companion was constantly letting me know that the worst is yet\
  \ to come. With an apprehensive smile, he told me to \u201Cimagine it\u2019s a free\
  \ roller coaster ride\u201D.  The fact that his knuckles were turning white as he\
  \ grasped the blemished steel railings in front of us, betrayed the cheery disposition.\
  \ He knew very well how some drivers have a deep rooted, demonstrably suicidal flirtation\
  \ with the impossibilities of the road. I would soon come to learn it too. \n\n\
  There appears to be a competition between busses and trucks. When the journey becomes\
  \ a little too ordinary for the taste of the drivers, they have to spice things\
  \ up a bit.  This occurs by overtaking trucks or other busses with the width of\
  \ a hair to spare, on an impossibly narrow and blind turn. Every time this happens\
  \ and there is no collision, I feel like a small miracle has happened. \n\nIt can\
  \ only be a person born completely without fear who proceeds to pursue the career\
  \ path of steering an ancient rattling TATA bus, up and down the winding foothills\
  \ of the Himalayas on a daily basis. The driver\u2019s recklessness can be totally\
  \ infuriating, scary and amusing.  It can even become inspiring after a few hours\
  \ of contemplating the minuscule space between the wheel and the edge of the road.\
  \ Another contribution to my silent bursts of existential despair is the fact that\
  \ I can be nowhere else, except for that seat on the bus. I have absolutely no control\
  \ over the situation. This lack of control, and the ultimate surrender to fate,\
  \ can drive you crazy or set you free. It was a urgent and visceral lesson in trust.\
  \ \n\nMost vehicles in India are decorated extensively. They are adorned with colourful\
  \ plastic flowers, strings of multi-coloured neon lights and elaborately embroidered\
  \ fabrics. Apart from the general d\xE9cor, it is ubiquitous to have a designated\
  \ space for the deities.  Tiny portable puja (ritual prayer) shrines. It generally\
  \ contains a framed picture or a statuette of a few gods \u2013 complete with a\
  \ little incense holder.\n\nAt some point I seriously started to contemplate if\
  \ the drivers have some supernatural skill \u2013 do they drive with telepathy?\
  \ Or on good Karma? Why not? The air in India is infused with the mysterious, irrational\
  \ and absurd. Most things seem to function beyond the scope of logic and reason.\
  \ I couldn\u2019t help but wonder if in this regard, it is better to be approximately\
  \ right than precisely wrong. \n\nOne day I was on a particularly long, bumpy and\
  \ terrifying ride. Immensely sleep deprived, I could no longer motivate myself to\
  \ continue with my mantra of endurance.  It was raining and the road had suffered\
  \ from dramatic erosion. My nerves were wrecked, I was a living emulation of fear.\
  \  Countless hours of this mental state can really test a person. \n\nSomewhere\
  \ along the road something changed. I had a lot of time to think about my way of\
  \ thinking.  One of my most profound teachers and mentors once taught me to \u201C\
  sit with the discomfort\u201D. While it is never pleasant in the moment, discomfort\
  \ is one of the sincerest ways of learning and growing. Remembering her words, I\
  \ sat with the discomfort. \n\nGradually, I began to enjoy the teasing of fate,\
  \ the rapid corners, the impossible overtakes. Most of all \u2013 the incredible\
  \ views of the massive, awe-inspiring mountains.  I no longer had a tiny heart attack\
  \ every time something impossible was about to happen \u2013 because I had learned\
  \ to trust. I could finally concentrate on the lives and universes of the people\
  \ in the places we passed through. There is such an abundance to get lost in. What\
  \ a cruel, crazy, beautiful world. \n\nAfter a sufficient number of insane journeys\
  \ on the roads of Himachal Pradesh, I found that. I had unintentionally achieved\
  \ a state of Zen. Facing your potential death on such a constant basis has a way\
  \ of calming the soul, which I paradoxically found much more amusing, playful and\
  \ rewarding than intentionally trying to do so."
