Text: "It is four AM and my over exuberant boyfriend is singing as he cracks open\
  \ our cans of milk. The heat is already teeming in from under the door. A bowl of\
  \ cornflakes, a conspicuously blue poncho, and some eyes-half-shut lacing up of\
  \ my sneakers and we're off. \n\nWe have Machu Picchu on the inside of our eyelids\
  \ in postcard-accurate detail, and we race the sun to her gates. We trudge (or in\
  \ Ian's case, prance) past the line for the buses. Ian shakes his head at them.\
  \ \"Fourteen dollars to skip all this fun!\" There is a steady thud shuffle stomp\
  \ of other drowsy feet accompanying ours, and I find myself drawn along by the insistent\
  \ hand of a competitively early riser. \n\nThe bottom gates open on cue as we arrive,\
  \ beating the sun by a generous forty minutes. And now comes the stairs.\n\nThe\
  \ Incan citadel looms somewhere above us and the march of the crowd is almost eery\
  \ in the dawn's reverent quiet. The forest here is dense and mercifully cool, and\
  \ I find myself wondering if the haphazard jumble of steps are themselves relics\
  \ of the 15th century. Five AM and already the trail is bustling. I lose count of\
  \ the number of times I stop for my screaming legs and panting. There is a sense\
  \ of urgency to the trek, both because of the growing queue at the top, and because\
  \ last night's adventurous dinner is gurgling away rather unsettlingly. I find myself\
  \ suddenly very accepting of the idea of two dollars for toilet paper, so long as\
  \ they let me in quickly.\n\nThey are their own story, the details we remember post-travel.\
  \ As accurate as any story is but with some of the details hazy or missing. When\
  \ we search aimlessly for sleep in a Colombian airport at three AM, or argue in\
  \ scant Spanish with a shifty taxi driver - these are the moments I console myself\
  \ with the notion that this will not make the final cut of memory. And yet, I am\
  \ writing to you of Machu Picchu and food poisoning.\n\nThe view is spectacular\
  \ though. Made better by the two hour walk with an irritable ache in my gut and\
  \ no fitness training. The local dogs that follow us up the steps as if something\
  \ very important is happening. Beating even the most determined to the top, only\
  \ to be sprayed by an angry Peruvian man with a hose.\n\nThe clouds linger, pirouetting\
  \ around the sides of the mountain. And we are the postcard. Hand-woven woollen\
  \ ponchos in a sea of plastic rain coats. The shrill phweee! of a furious official\
  \ as we climb an ancient stone, stand too close to the edge, explore in the wrong\
  \ direction. \n\nAnd we are the postcard. The looming cliffs, the alpacas, the young\
  \ girls selling vibrant friendship bracelets, the packed sandwiches, the rain that\
  \ empties half of Machu Picchu for us, the darting around tour groups, the moon\
  \ temple, the laughter bouncing down the side of the Andes.\n\nWe are the postcard."
