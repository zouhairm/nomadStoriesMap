Text: "\u2018Kalimera Dominique,\u2019 read the warm reply email from Panayotis. \u2018\
  You can come at any time you want here in Lexi-Logos and start getting courses in\
  \ Modern Greek. Our courses are open all the year. Schedules change all the time\u2026\
  .There is nothing to prepay\u2019.\n\nThe response personified everything I imagined\
  \ about the Greeks \u2013 accommodating, unhurried, honest. It suited my preference\
  \ for spontaneity. After all, here I was, attempting to book daily language lessons\
  \ two weeks out from my arrival. \n\nI told Panayotis I\u2019d start on Monday 4\
  \ June. \u2018Your daily schedule will be 12.30 to 2pm,\u2019 came the reply. \u2018\
  I hope this is suitable and as you are flexible, we could maybe move it sometimes\u2019\
  . I was charmed.\n\nI\u2019d first visited Athens with school, aged 16, and had\
  \ fallen instantly for the head-spin of aromas, activity and artefacts. Since then\
  \ I\u2019d pitied the tourists who stop by only to climb the Acropolis, then join\
  \ the throng in some disingenuous, fake cobble-stoned square on Santorini or Mykonos.\
  \ Almost in protest, I\u2019d be spending three weeks in Athens, alone.\n\nMy mission\
  \ \u2013 besides being nonconformist \u2013 was to learn basic Greek and live the\
  \ Athens of an Athenian. But the potency of my romantic teenage memories left me\
  \ unprepared for Athens amid a depression.\n\nOn Google Maps, my Airbnb on Artistotelous\
  \ Street, near Victoria Square, seemed an easy walk to centrally-located Lexi-Logos.\
  \ It was also a few minutes on foot from the illustrious National Archaeological\
  \ Museum. So it had to be safe. \n\nThe taxi driver who escorted me from the airport\
  \ was quick to correct me. He strained in his best English to caution that going\
  \ out after dark, or anywhere east of my street, were off limits. The square itself,\
  \ home to Victoria metro station, overspills with refugees and their belongings.\
  \ I\u2019d heard UN Refugee Agency reports that over a million people had reached\
  \ Greece in 2015. Now, as an Australian who\u2019d always taken her space for granted,\
  \ I understood in physical terms what that meant. \n\nOn day one of class at Lexi-Logos,\
  \ I trailed 28th October Street \u2013 heeding the taxi\u2019s advice \u2013 and\
  \ observed the visual markers of global financial and refugee crises unfairly thrusted\
  \ upon the Athenians: immigrants huddled on broken pavement, mounds of uncollected\
  \ rubbish festering under June sunlight, scaffolding supporting dilapidated buildings,\
  \ boarded-up shops. A Maria Callas fan, I\u2019d been keen to see the crumbling\
  \ neoclassical mansion that had once housed the last true prima donna, but I was\
  \ too distracted to enjoy it. \n\nThe change of scene when I reached Lexi-Logos\
  \ in Kapnikareas Square was a welcome relief. Kapnikareas sits incongruously half-way\
  \ down the Ermou shopping street, which still thrives in protest to the economy.\
  \ The square is distinguished by the diminutive 11th century church of Panagia Kapnikarea,\
  \ one of Athen\u2019s oldest. Even more marvelous than its exterior gold mosaic\
  \ of Madonna and child, is the aerial view from Lexi-Logos\u2019 rooftop classrooms.\
  \ \n\nPanayotis may be relaxed about student admissions \u2013 and about lighting\
  \ a cigarette or receiving a phone call during class \u2013 but he masters pedagogy,\
  \ sets an ambitious pace, and will get you speaking Greek if that\u2019s your goal.\
  \ \n\nAs the city that birthed philosophy, Athens is almost designed for study.\
  \ As bookshops close their doors around the world, here bookshop-cafes are ubiquitous\
  \ and serve an essential oasis from bustling street life. \n\nSneak out the back\
  \ of Poems and Crimes, on Aghias Irinis Street, and discover otherwise missed street\
  \ art and a leafy deck to revise your lesson over a freshly made salad. In this\
  \ city you\u2019re never lonely, so be prepared to share with locals feeding stray\
  \ cats. \n\nAt aptly named Little Tree Books and Coffee, on Kavalloti Street, under\
  \ the Acropolis museum, you\u2019re guaranteed to remain undistributed as you muddle\
  \ through homework for hours on a single frappe. Maybe because they know the tiny\
  \ but meticulously curated selection of English books by and about Greeks is so\
  \ absorbing that you\u2019ll be back. \n\nBut these are just two of many. As I progressed\
  \ through my lessons, the more I noticed how adversity was energising Athenian people\
  \ and venues. If I pitied the 24-hour traveller, the Athenian would surely mock\
  \ me for thinking I\u2019d see their world in three weeks."
