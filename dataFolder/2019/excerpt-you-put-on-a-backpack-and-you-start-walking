Text: "Along the muddy trail between the first two glaciers on the W path, we stop\
  \ for a quick snack of trail mix.  Sitting on some high rocks beside our green and\
  \ yellow backpacks, Best Friend starts picking out the sweet yogurty bits from the\
  \ mix. I turn to her and murmur \u201Cyou keep that up, I break your hands.\u201D\
  \ \n\nThe conversation had started a month before:\n\n\u201CWhat do you know about\
  \ backpacking?\u201D she implored.\n\n\u201CYou put on a backpack and you start\
  \ walking,\u201D I answered. \u201CYou don\u2019t know how to walk?\u201D\n\nAnd\
  \ so it was decided. Instead of lounging on the beach in Rio, as she would have\
  \ preferred, Best Friend and I would hike through the Torres del Paine national\
  \ park in the heart of Chilean Patagonia.  \n\nOn that southwestern edge of South\
  \ America, where the map shows the land cookie-crumbling away, we would be treated\
  \ to glaciers retreating; the cuernos (horns) of rock, big as houses, offering up\
  \ sharp-toothed impressions of geological time; and the famed torres : monoliths\
  \ of stone rising high into the clouds. At the time, though, our knowledge of the\
  \ place was limited to postcard images, empty of the wind that would batter us and\
  \ the storms that would sweep like meteorological dust bunnies across the sky. \n\
  \nThe first leg of the journey was a flight from Santiago to Punta Arenas, where\
  \ I would meet Best Friend.  I sat on the left side of the plane, as instructed\
  \ by the travel agent, so we could see the whole length of the Andean cordillera\
  \ \u2013 the mountains a geological crumpling of land, where the North American\
  \ and Pacific plates had collided. \n\nPunta Arenas is charming and windswept and\
  \ small. The last major town as you head south in this region, it is home to an\
  \ Air Force base, and some shops and restaurants reflecting the tourism business\
  \ that dominates in the five un-snowy months of the year. We would spend a few days\
  \ there with a Chilean friend -- a gracious hostess, who took us out to see the\
  \ small local penguins that colonize the beach, and to the cemetery that is famous\
  \ for its monuments and topiary trees, and to the town statue whose toe is burnished\
  \ from the kisses it demands in exchange for good luck. \n\nBut we were headed to\
  \ Puerto Natales, the gateway to Torres del Paine, so we thanked our friend the\
  \ next day and took a four-hour bus ride across the gruff countryside. We arrived\
  \ to a Spanish-style town, houses huddled up, and the peaks of the Andes standing\
  \ shoulder to shoulder, watching mightily as if warning us what was ahead. \n\n\
  Though this has never been confirmed, there is a standing agreement between Best\
  \ Friend and me that I am the stronger of the two, and that my pack  - in addition\
  \ to the clothes and the food that we split up - would contain the tent as well.\
  \ My guitar, and anything else we realized was not necessary, would stay at the\
  \ hostel until we got back. However, I pack my bathing suit wherever I go. \u201C\
  You know that the only water there is from glaciers, right?\u201D Best Friend astutely\
  \ pointed out. I nodded like I knew that. The bathing suit stayed at the hostel.\
  \ \n\nAnd then sunrise, and the van, and the entrance to the park. There we were,\
  \ map in hand. This was what we had been building towards: just put on a backpack\
  \ and start walking. We walked. The sky was expansive and we were, immediately,\
  \ fortunate and small. The ground went from paved parking lot to Patagonia muddy\
  \ and then the first push from rock to rock, and then the slippery bits when we\
  \ had to begin to warn one another to step here, or grab that branch. Walking became\
  \ something more than walking as the boulders grew up around us and we moved along\
  \ the path with purpose."
