Text: "The first time I though about visiting Bosnia and Herzegovina I could situated\
  \ in the map with difficulty. I knew that the capital was Sarajevo. But I didn\u2019\
  t recall that much about the history behind this city and its importance for the\
  \ history and diversity of Europe. We had a renting car at Banja Luka\u2019s Airport\
  \ to go to Sarajevo and everything was great until we saw ourselves driving between\
  \ the Bosnian mountains, literally like a roof above the road. Overall, driving\
  \ is fine in Bosnia and the toll motorways are not expensive. When arriving to Sarajevo,\
  \ you realize you are not entering a big city nor a really old one. But what you\
  \ see quickly is that you are in a post-war city where some of the bullets holes\
  \ are still there. Some building hide them, others are completely abandoned and\
  \ remain a leftover of the war that took place between 1992 and 1995.\n\nInside\
  \ the city the majority of the architecture looks fine, but still very different\
  \ from the European cities. You can walk around the markets, eat a tasteful Turkish\
  \ bread full of meat and raw onions (Cevapi) and drink Bosnian coffee. Look, you\
  \ can feel Sarajevo is different! It was founded in 1461, so it is actually quite\
  \ new and currently the largest city in Bosnia and Herzegovina. I was keen to understand\
  \ more about the culture in this country when I discovered the history of religious\
  \ and cultural diversity of Sarajevo, where you can find a mosque, Catholic church,\
  \ Orthodox church and synagogue in the same neighborhood. \n\nBeing Islam the biggest\
  \ religion in the country, it is said that one should not leave Sarajevo without\
  \ climbing up the hill overlooking Sarajevo city and counting the amount of minarets\
  \ of the city. Really difficult task to accomplish. In fact, the exact number is\
  \ not clear. There were more than thousand mosques, but it is estimated that 80%\
  \ of them were damaged or destroyed during the conflict. Sarajevo has great night-life\
  \ too, you will probably find plenty of smoky places with life music to enjoy, also\
  \ nightclubs and standard cafes.\n\nNature in Bosnia is amazing. Apart from the\
  \ huge mountains and the green, there are more than ten different waterfalls you\
  \ can visit, as well as lakes and rivers. We decided to go to the south of the country\
  \ and visit \u201CKravice Falls\u201D in our way to visit two other cities: Mostar\
  \ and Po\u010Ditelj. It is peaceful and quiet place if you go when the water is\
  \ too cold, and during summer it is lovely for a swim and plenty of people. Kravice\
  \ Falls are inside of a natural park. Therefore, it is recommendable to check the\
  \ schedule and the price. \n\nPo\u010Ditelj is a small village and a leftover of\
  \ the Ottoman Empire. Super medieval, super cool. There, we stop to eat and visit\
  \ the city. The Sahat kula of Po\u010Ditelj, where watchmen and military guard the\
  \ city, and the Hajji Alija mosque are worthy to see if it suits in your plans.\
  \ On the other hand, Mostar is much more a touristic city. It has a really beautiful\
  \ center full of narrow streets and nice restaurants. The Stari Most or bridge of\
  \ Mostar it is full of people taking pictures, but you can go down close to the\
  \ river to have a nice view of one of the most famous historical monuments of the\
  \ former Yugoslavia. Moreover, Banjaluka offers the picture of \u201Cthe other Bosnia\u201D\
  . It is the second largest city in Bosnia and it has different architecture, similar\
  \ to East-European countries. It is beautiful town is surrounded by rolling green\
  \ hills. The Museum of the Republika Srpska is a must-see in Banjaluka because it\
  \ helps to understand better Bosnia and the history that Bosnia and Europe will\
  \ share forever."
