Text: "Even her smile was serious. Big black curls and bigger brown eyes, she wore\
  \ a pink cotton dress and sparkly sandals, and couldn\u2019t have been two years\
  \ old yet. I had been taking photos of the words of the Virgin of Guadalupe painted\
  \ in eight indigenous languages before stopping to watch her toddle along rows of\
  \ pews in one of Oaxaca City\u2019s myriad churches. The girl tripped on nothing,\
  \ as babies do, her face smashing flat against the stone floor. She didn\u2019t\
  \ move. \n\nHer father, in black jeans and a tidy, tucked-in shirt was carrying\
  \ a bulky duffle and he rushed to pick her up and wipe the dust off. She didn\u2019\
  t cry. \n\nI cooed at her braveness in Spanish. Her dad grinned at me: \u201CShe\u2019\
  s tough.\u201D I could only nod: Indeed she was. \n\n\u201CWe come from Guatemala,\u201D\
  \ he added. Then in English, he chirped: \u201CAmerican Dream!\u201D He told me,\
  \ \u201CWe\u2019ve been sleeping in the plaza,\u201D before adding the chorus in\
  \ English: \u201CAmerican Dream!\u201D\n\n\u201CDon\u2019t do it,\u201D I wanted\
  \ to say, filled up with colonialist wisdom and all my sleek passported, smooth\
  \ border crossing experiences. Because, I remember the dust and sun and mesquite\
  \ scrub of the Sonoran desert between Mexico and Tucson. I remember stopping at\
  \ the crosses where human remains had been found, and how just one day in the crippling\
  \ desert heat renders a body unidentifiable. I remember working in the migrant shelter\
  \ in Guadalajara: the way the men ate so quietly, as if they feared even their food\
  \ would be taken from them, and how we never had enough size 28 waist pants for\
  \ all those skinny boys heading to what they call, \u2018The Other Side.\u2019 There\
  \ were never enough socks for those walking across Mexico. I remember translating\
  \ documents for an asylum case for a man who ran away from the cartels, translating\
  \ all the things they could do to a body, and I remember the news reports of the\
  \ endless unmarked graves of migrants along the tracks and in remote ranches here\
  \ in Mexico. \n\nThe afternoon sun dribbled in through the heavy church door, and\
  \ we stood talking, and I thought of these things.\n\nI wanted to say, \u201CThe\
  \ American Dream doesn\u2019t exist anymore.\u201D There are friends here in Mexico\
  \ who don\u2019t talk much of their deportation stories, like Don Julian, who watched\
  \ his daughter\u2019s wedding in the States by Skype. There are babies, still in\
  \ the States although their parents were deported\u2014babies who I think must look\
  \ like this girl, now bobbling off in another direction, her father behind her.\
  \ Her dress was so clean and pink, and there was still so much road to travel. I\
  \ can\u2019t help but think that if they arrived to the north, would she be plundered\
  \ from his arms, like what happened to thousands more who crossed the border?\n\n\
  Pico Iyer, in one of his more famous essays, touches on responding to the dreams\
  \ that others tender to you: Do you matchmake an illusion, or attempt to strip those\
  \ you meet of the one thing that sustains them? I don\u2019t know if anyone can\
  \ come up with a satisfying answer. I neither want these many possible horrors to\
  \ befall this father and daughter, nor do I wish to crumble his dreams between my\
  \ fingers like broken flowers. \n\nBecause, what do I know of the American Dream?\
  \ I too left my homeland to find the life I wanted, and wasn\u2019t interested in\
  \ others\u2019 opinions of what I should do. I too pedaled my fortunes across countries,\
  \ and am filled up with dreams. Because, I too have children\u2014not much older\
  \ than this baby girl\u2014and I too would put them into a leaky raft, if Home was\
  \ aflame.\n\nWeeks later, I am still thinking of them, and repeat like a mantra,\
  \ \u201CQue les vaya bien.\u201D May it go well for you. May this father and daughter\
  \ somehow hear my whisper, as if the wind will carry it to them. And, in telling\
  \ and retelling the story, in writing it, this wish will pour onward, around them\
  \ and around everyone who is doing hard things for their children and the ones they\
  \ love. May it go well for you."
