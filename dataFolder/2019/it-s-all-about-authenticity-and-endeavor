Text: "Anything dealing with authenticity and the original one tend to receive much\
  \ attention from people. And I am the one who easily to dive deep into the allure\
  \ of chastity. It was around 10 a.m., I rode my motorbike to the old factory in\
  \ Surabaya, Indonesia. My first stop was the soy sauce factory. The aroma of soy\
  \ sauce was suddenly burst out into the air, it was a sign that I reached to the\
  \ right place. Not-too-ample building, only a small factory inside the alley. It\
  \ is placed on Sidonipah (street) II/3-5. I saw a bunch of people, I guessed the\
  \ workers, mostly were women, ranging from young to around 70 years old. Their spirit\
  \ and hardwork, I adored with how they worked cohesively. \n\nUnfortunately, I did\
  \ not get a permission to come inside, only permitted looking from outside. The\
  \ owner told me to come back with at least 10 people not only one person. It was\
  \ a bit dissapointed since I could\u2019t deny how curious am I to know about the\
  \ process in making soy sauce and the \u201Csecret recipe\u201D. But, however, I\
  \ had a chance to talk with the owner, getting closer to the workers, captured their\
  \ activity in packaging the soy sauce into the bottles. Bottles used are divided\
  \ into two, glass bottles and plastic bottles. They were produced two thousand bottles\
  \ of soy sauce per day. \n\nIn general, soy sauce is made only from soybeans, wheat,\
  \ and salt. Kecap Cap Jeruk Pecel Tulen (soy sauce) has been established since 1937\
  \ and ran into three generations. This home industry founded by Hwan Kieng Hien\
  \ and his wife, then continued by his children and grandchildren. They had approximately\
  \ 50 workers. They kept the tradition alive by preserving traditional production\
  \ techniques with natural ingredients. According to a research, the main ingredients\
  \ used here include black soybeans, water, and salt. They also added brown sugar\
  \ and spices. Moreover, soy sauce here was a liquid and consisted of aroma and flavor.\
  \ Normally, soy sauce is made by a two-step fermentation process from wheat flour\
  \ and soy beans with a mixture of molds, yeasts, and bacteria. The important factor\
  \ need to be considered was they must give characteristic aroma and flavor to the\
  \ soy sauce. The quality control of soy sauce in this factory was conducted in industrialized\
  \ testing and calibration laboratories at Jagir Wonokromo (street) No. 360, Surabaya.\
  \ \n\nFinally, it was such a nice experience for visiting the old factory in Surabaya.\
  \ What makes them survive until now is because their authenticity and endeavor in\
  \ producing soy sauce. And the natural ingredients are the best option and their\
  \ success key."
