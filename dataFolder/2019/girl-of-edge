Text: "my life has transformed since I went to this exotic place, Koh Samui. I could\
  \ remember very well about all the details about the situations, emotions, physical\
  \ of myself back at that time. I was despair, depressed, low spirited for almost\
  \ 2 years after battle with my divorce. It was a darkest period of my time and I\
  \ have lost. Then, I saw the adds of a month intensive yoga teacher training in\
  \ the tropical island. I was in doubt to take the leap because financial issue and\
  \ I have to sacrifice all the commitments with clients. But my gut told me to do\
  \ it so with all the courage, ton of fears, curiosity I flew to Koh Samui. It was\
  \ my first experience travel solo in the new place. All the mixed feelings make\
  \ me want to explore about the myself, this teacher training, the paradise, the\
  \ locals and culture. My yoga school just perched on a cliff, in the jungle, overlooking\
  \ the ocean. \nMy days would like pranayama (breathing practice), morning yoga practice,\
  \ healthy brunch, connect and making new friends. yoga theory/methodology, group/self\
  \ study, evening yoga practice, healthy dinner buffet watching the sunset from the\
  \ cafe where is located on top of the cliff. Through these busy schedule we conncected\
  \ to our deepest self and tp others, to the nature surrounding us. Once of week\
  \ on our day off, we went to sightseeings, try local delicacies, explore the island\
  \ with motorbike. Back in 2013 a very little amount of Asian tourist like me, so\
  \ whenever I go people always thought I'm a local and start to speak Thai with me.\
  \ Majority tourist were from Eastern Europe so Asian but unfortunately I can't make\
  \ the best of this opportunity of being suspected as a local, The locals are nice\
  \ and friendly, they love to engage and speaking more to me. \nThis whole experience\
  \ allows deeper connections with the spiritual and physical being that surround\
  \ me. It was truly amazing period time in my life, life changing experience, the\
  \ boundless connection and friendship. I started believe in myself again, became\
  \ a new person with more confidence, my perspectives of life has been expanded widely,\
  \ I start to see things differently. Since then, I start to falling in love with\
  \ Koh Samui, humble enough to called this place as my second home. The magical of\
  \ this place make me want to come back every year to venturing inward, to rejuvenate\
  \ and reconnect with my deepest self. \nI become a yoga teacher since then, teaching\
  \ and sharing my passions to others become my purpose. It also drives me to travel\
  \ more after that, Go to places solo and connect with everything in that new place.\
  \ Yoga can absolutely heal from life\"s sorrow and achieve happiness through self\
  \ love, compassion and kindness. It a perfect match with travelling, I can find\
  \ myself more every time I travel. I travel and I do yoga by myself in the nature,\
  \ beach or find some yoga studios to practice. It beyond the words how these experience\
  \ already change my horizons since my first solo travel. Whenever I go I do yoga,\
  \ whenever I travel I explore the unknown, I travel deep into myself."
