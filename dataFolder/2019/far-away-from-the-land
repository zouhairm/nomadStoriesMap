Text: "'There is nothing to be scared of on this ride', I declared lying flat on my\
  \ stomach, clutching the handles as tightly as I could. The Ringo ride was about\
  \ to start and we both were excited to take it. \n\nAntra, my friend from school\
  \ days, had agreed to take this trip with me to this coastal town in south-west\
  \ India, named Gokarna. I had turned 23 and I wanted to start it with some adventure\
  \ sports. The ringo ride started and I could feel the force with which the waves\
  \ hit my body from below the ring.  The vast expanse of the Arabian sea in front\
  \ of me and the majesty of the evening sun left me mesmerized. The motorboat took\
  \ speed and it was as if I was surfing on the waves. I was superwoman in that moment.\
  \ Riding on the waves, reaching for the horizon.\n\nJust then, the motorboat took\
  \ a U-turn. I lost my grip on the handles. The high speed of the boat and the centrifugal\
  \ force threw me far into the waters. I was a discus in that moment. Flying in the\
  \ air, reaching for the sea. \n\nI dropped with a thud and splashed into the waters.\
  \ I didn't know how to swim but the life-jacket kept me afloat. I was right in the\
  \ middle of a nat-geo set, lost in the middle of the sea, far from the lands with\
  \ no idea what could come and engulf me from below the waters. The person on the\
  \ motorboat came closer and asked me to swim to the ring. I was a buoy in that moment.\
  \ Floating on water, reaching for the boat.\n\nRealising how hopeless I was, he\
  \ threw a rope for me and pulled me to the boat with it. Now the task was to get\
  \ on the ring. I am a lean person with zero muscle strength. The person on the boat\
  \ put all his might to pull me up and almost lost his balance in the process. I\
  \ was a dead-weight in that moment. Pushing against nothing, reaching for nothing.\n\
  \nHe somehow managed to get me next to Antra again. She rolled her eyes at me, for\
  \ my performance on the adventure was nowhere near my excitement for the adventure.\
  \ We were now heading back to the lands. I could see the mountains sprawled over\
  \ the shore, lined by tiny people on the beach. Leaving behind the horizon, the\
  \ sun and the infinite sea, we were headed back to safety. \n\nThis adventure started\
  \ with a superwoman and ended in dead-weight. The year 23 was a nice start, a good\
  \ lesson about uncertainties in life as we enter adulthood. Before the ride, I didn't\
  \ expect to find myself in the middle of the sea, nothing to hold on to and nothing\
  \ to reach out for."
