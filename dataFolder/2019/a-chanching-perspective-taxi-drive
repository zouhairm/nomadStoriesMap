Text: "I have always loved to read. When I was small, I got impatient when my father\
  \ was not able to read me \u201CHeart\u201D by Edmondo de Amicis for many Sundays.\
  \ I got upset and started to read the rest of the book by myself. Since I was not\
  \ used to reading and I was still learning how to do it, It took me many days to\
  \ finish it. Nonetheless, from them on, I have always been an avid reader and writer.\
  \ Though, now I think some books were not appropriate for my age, for example being\
  \ 8 years old and reading the complete version of the Count of Monte Cristo (which\
  \ is still my favorite book).\n\n Not only reading leads to good stories, listening\
  \ to our grandparents or starting a conversation in a coffee shop can also make\
  \ us listen to wonderful narrations, especially when one is travelling. I had the\
  \ fortune to be able to do so as an exchange student in France, and it is amazing\
  \ how many different tales I was able to collect, some with disappointments, other\
  \ with unexpected but appreciated acts of kindness. \n\nWhile I love reading and\
  \ writing, I have not been able to pursue these dreams. Most of my writings were\
  \ destroyed when my parents reformatted the family computer and, my mother still\
  \ thinks all my books are just a waste of space. Most people in my surroundings\
  \ do not really think I can live exclusively from these passions.  So, I became\
  \ a lawyer and it hasn\xB4t  allowed me to accomplish my aspirations in the way\
  \ I expected or would have liked. I have learned a lot and I like my job, but I\
  \ want to be passionate with what I do.\n\n It was in one of my usual work days\
  \ that I encountered a story which I was not seeking. How ironic it that, I thought,\
  \ as many others, that only by travelling in a faraway land  can we encounter wonderful\
  \ narrations and didn\xB4t realize the richness that surrounds us. That day, I did\
  \ \u201Ctravel\u201D, but I was just taking a Taxi, as Uber didn\u2019t want to\
  \ accept my payment (it still doesn\u2019t), in order to reach a governmental office.\
  \ \n\n I had been having a very bad day: I lost some of my money, was having personal\
  \ issues and had a non-planned heavy work load at the office. Nonetheless, I still\
  \ had to go to that governmental office, at the outskirts of the city, which was\
  \ more than one driving hour away.  As I angrily complained my problems to the taxi\
  \ driver, he consoled me and told me a little about himself. Eduardo worked as a\
  \ taxi driver in the day, and as a security officer in the nights. He had a special\
  \ needs kid along with his other children and wife at home. He did not make a lot\
  \ of money, but he was not resentful. He also told me about a boy he drove for in\
  \ the weekends, some years ago. A handsome rich teenager whom contracted HIV. Lots\
  \ of girls still approached him, but when he told them his condition, no one wanted\
  \ to be with him if sex was not on the table.\n\n The taxi driver reflected that,\
  \ money or not, good looks or not, every human needs a friendly helping hand. The\
  \ taxi driver also saved 4 children in a hospital explosion (which actually happened\
  \ not far away from my home), he received media attention for some time, but was\
  \ not really officially awarded. At the end of the day, he brought me to the government\
  \ office, waited for me an hour, took me back to the office, charged me less than\
  \ the correct price, gave me his number in case I needed help, smiled and, wished\
  \ me that the rest of my day improved. It was better thanks to him. \nI could tell\
  \ you about many adventurous and flashy or tragic stories I have encountered, but\
  \ I prefer to share my brief meeting with this man that happened during an everyday\
  \ \u201Cusual\u201D journey. There are many rich stories around us, wealthy because\
  \ of the people within them, we just need to pay a closer look."
