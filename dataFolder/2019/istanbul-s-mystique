Text: "Having never been farther than France and Germany I ventured farther West to\
  \ Turkey five years ago. Being from the U.S.A the culture was a leap into the unknown.\
  \ English is my only language. Although Having traveled to three foreign countries\
  \ total in the past, it has never been an issue. The natives always seem to take\
  \ to my Southern Charm. \n\nIstanbul a picturesque city by the sea. Being a Christian\
  \ who is unbiased towards others whose belief set is different than mine, I was\
  \ swept away by the  intrigue of the beautifully adorned mosque above the sea. \
  \ Prayers were recited three times a day throughout the city on loudspeakers. Along\
  \ with Turkish food, welcoming locals, the culture was something for books to rave\
  \ about. \n\nI immensely enjoy traveling to mysterious new cultures and have a niche\
  \ for writing. I always will cherish my Istanbul memories. From the sea, the city\
  \ square, the lovely mosque, the people, the whole cultural experience will always\
  \ be a breath of fresh air in my mind. \n\nI would love this opportunity to travel\
  \ to Portugal and take in all its wonderful delights! I would love the people the\
  \ most I think. Historic places are a sight for sore eyes, but the power, the intrigue\
  \ is always found within the lovely inhabitants of any culture."
