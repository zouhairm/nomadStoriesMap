Text: "Without any planification, I wake up one morning last September with an urge\
  \ for a break from my current world. I opened my laptop and I booked an all inclusive\
  \ to cancun for 5 days. All by myself, in a 5-star adult only hotel, I discovered\
  \ for the first time the joy of traveling alone to a new destination. \nSun, sand,\
  \  water, alcohol, sexy bikinis, swimming suits and most importantly happy people\
  \ from all over the world, coming to spend good moments and have fun - with no limits\
  \ let\u2019s say! \nI was mesmerized by the scenery and the beauty. I was equally\
  \ taken back by an old story that I lived when I was 19 years old. She and I had\
  \ an undeniable chemistry, and for the whole stay I spent pretty much every waking\
  \ moment remembering her in more ways than one. I recalled how we talked so much\
  \ about everything from what we\u2019d name our future kids to whether or not we\u2019\
  d retire at 35 years old or younger in an island like Cancun - Ha! \nI shared the\
  \ name \u2018Noah\u2019 for that hypothetical unborn son. She shared the name \u2018\
  Leah\u2019 for that hypothetical unborn daughter, and just like that our children\
  \ had identities. We could have never know then that we\u2019d separate and that\
  \ each one of us would have a different weird kind of life. \nThere was a marriage\
  \ happening on the sandy beach that Saturday in Cancun resort. I\u2019ll never forget\
  \ her asking me what I thought about marriage and if I might already know the person\
  \ I\u2019d marry. Little did we both know that life would turn against our love,\
  \ and that we would grow to chase this love for the rest of our lives. \nStill,\
  \ I filled cancun with sleepless nights, parties galore, romantic solo walks on\
  \ the beach at sunrise imagining a whole lot of puppy love. \nThis trip made me\
  \ realize that she never quite left my heart and mind. If only I was to see her\
  \ walking in front of me in cancun where we\u2019d come back into each other\u2019\
  s arms and pick up where we\u2019d left off. \nInstead, I decided to focus on enjoying\
  \ the moment, the nature and the people. When I tell my friends and family about\
  \ my experience there, i tell them about the deep blue andnclear water that Surrounds\
  \ cancun; it looks nothing like the water you see in the Mediterranean Sea. The\
  \ beaches consist white, powder like sand that sinks when you step in it. \nThere\
  \ are many fun things to do in cancun such as testing how high you can go on one\
  \ of their parasailing trips or, if you are scared of heights, taking out a jet\
  \ ski into thenawesome waves of thengulf, or going on a scuba diving or snorkeling\
  \ trip. \nDancing with the dolphins is not as much fun though, because I\u2019m\
  \ the wild dolphins are 100% different than the ones that have been trained to be\
  \ around people. They are more protective and aggressive in the wild, but all and\
  \ all swimming with dolphins is one experience in my life that I will never forget.\
  \ \nOne more thing I decided to do while in cancun is go on the XPOR tour. It was\
  \ a combination of many activities. I did zip-lining, river rafting and the river\
  \ swim. The first thing that I did was go river rafting. The rafts looked as if\
  \ they were made out of wood with a seat carved out and a little compartment in\
  \ the middle of the hand paddles you use to get around. The paddles were tied around\
  \ my hands in order to move around all the curves in the river. After this experience,\
  \ I went zip-lining. There were seven different zip-lines, my favourite ones were\
  \ those that went under a waterfall and into the water. I felt like I was on top\
  \ of the world when I was going over trees and the river of the zip-lines. The river\
  \ swim was one of the last things I did on this tour.\nMemories are favoured forever,\
  \ specially amazing memories like the ones I made in Cancun. It\u2019s a legendary\
  \ and charming destination for everyone."
