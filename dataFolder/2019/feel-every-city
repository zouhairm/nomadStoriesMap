Text: "Have I ever been on trips? Oh yeah! Did I have unforgettable impressions? Of\
  \ course yes! Did I get really important experience? And again yes! \nI think almost\
  \ everyone in our time wants to travel, to see the world, it's supposedly a kind\
  \ of \"mainstream\" of the twenty-first century, so I'm not an exception ... I'm\
  \ dreaming about a round-the-world trip and I have been already in some European\
  \ countries, but now when I\u2019m twenty, at first I want to see my motherland,\
  \ because we have a lot of incredible places here, which must necessarily be visited\
  \ by every Ukrainian. That is why I have already walked in the unsurpassed quiet\
  \ streets of Lviv, spent an active time in fussy Kiev, sunbathed in the wonderful\
  \ Odessa, saw the enormous fortresses and castles of Mukacheve, Uzhgorod and Ivano-Frankivsk,\
  \ relax on the beaches of Iron Porto and Kirillovka ... and visited many nice towns\
  \ and cities. In my opinion this places are really interesting, they bring joy and\
  \ good mood, but besides this, there is another fact that connects me with each\
  \ of these cities. I bet that you do not know what I mean, but my friends and relatives\
  \ have guessed at once!\nI got lost in EVERY city that I had an opportunity to visit,\
  \ yes, you didn\u2019t make mistakes, just get lost! This is normal, of course,\
  \ because there were new places for me, but I'm an exception to the rules, for me\
  \ such situations are ALWAYS. And of course it happened to me at the most untimely\
  \ moment.\nFor the first time I get lost in the city of Lion, we rested with the\
  \ class, visited a lot of museums, and when, finally, we were given the opportunity\
  \ to walk freely without any supervision or control. My friend and I immediately\
  \ decided to find the famous \"Workshop of Chocolate\". Having learned the road\
  \ (teachers told us the way) we started our trip. But what our surprise was when\
  \ we, having wandered around the center, met our mentors again, they repeated one\
  \ more time the location of the store, but in spite of this, after an hour we understood\
  \ that we are in the industrial district of Lviv. However, we were not lost, bought\
  \ a map (such a huge one that could only be kept together!) And still returned to\
  \ the center where we met our group. By the way, we still got to the workshop, but\
  \ only the next day with other peers.\nNot once I\u2019m lost alone, so in Odessa\
  \ I could not even figure out which direction I should go to the hotel, although\
  \ it was already the third day of the trip! Then I stayed alone, confused and with\
  \ tears in my eyes. The same situation happened in the Iron Port, despite the fact\
  \ that it is a small populated town. I can talk a lot of such \u201Cadventures\u201D\
  , all my friends are accustomed to this and almost never let me alone, or just after\
  \ having made sure that I clearly understood where I should go.\nWhy have I been\
  \ taught such adventures? In the first place, to restrain my emotions and avoid\
  \ confusion, I am a person who loves to keep everything going according to the plan\
  \ and such situations lead me to despair; I was always afraid to talk with passers-by,\
  \ because I'm not very sociable person, but now (with my experience!), I can easily\
  \ communicate with any stranger. Probably, I even became more confident in myself,\
  \ maybe someone would call my problems a trifle, but my \"walks\" caught me by surprise\
  \ and seemed to be a real tragedy, although now I really recall some of them with\
  \ a smile on my face. And finally, the main sense: I saw many different sides of\
  \ the cities, not typical touristic places which everybody likes and enjoys. I saw\
  \ simple employees hurrying to work, families walking in the streets, people who\
  \ smiled and cried, I saw even homeless with alienation in their eyes. I think,\
  \ thanks to my losses I felt the real cities, the spirit and the atmosphere of each\
  \ of them."
