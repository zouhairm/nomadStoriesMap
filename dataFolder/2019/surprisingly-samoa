Text: "A refrigeration truck pulled up next to us as at the lights. \n\n\u201CWow!\
  \ That\u2019s Tip Top ice cream from home!\u201D I said. \n\nMy friend and I salivated\
  \ at the idea of a sweet treat to acclimatise to the Samoan heat. The delivery man\
  \ cruised alongside us, with a cheeky grin, before signalling to our driver that\
  \ he wanted our numbers. We laughed and politely declined. Our driver signed to\
  \ Mr Tip Top that he wasn\u2019t so lucky. He showed us his heart breaking. \n\n\
  God and pick-up lines are alive and well in this small Pacific nation.\n\nThis meet-cute\
  \ turned our mundane airport transfer conversation from regurgitated religion and\
  \ land facts into romantic matters.\n \u201CIf you take the bus and there are no\
  \ seats left, you just sit on somebody\u2019s knees\u2026 that\u2019s how a lot\
  \ of relationships start,\u201D laughed our driver.\n\nAfter checking into our resort,\
  \ we found some freedom through hiring a car. The Red Rocket, a small and slow-to-start\
  \ hatchback, was to be our trusty chariot. We soon learnt that the main features\
  \ of the skinny sealed roads were gaggles of chickens, roaming dogs, and random\
  \ speed bumps; which not only kept the speed limit down but also marked the approaching\
  \ villages. The stirring of creatures alerted the children to come and wave at the\
  \ sunburnt palangis driving past.\n\nWe had seen enough volleyball nets to want\
  \ to pull over and join in with a couple of the kids playing. Within five minutes,\
  \ the mamas fanning themselves from inside the fales watched as two teams of four\
  \ expand to a match of 20-aside. A young man took a shine to my friend and began\
  \ asking introductory questions.\n\n\u201CMy name is Days\u2026 Days Of Our Lives,\u201D\
  \ he smiled before asking, \u201CDo you have a boyfriend?\u201D\n\u201CYes, back\
  \ in New Zealand,\u201D she replied.\n\u201CBut do you want a boyfriend\u2026 in\
  \ Samoa?\u201D he tried.\n\nIt was a good time to leave this over-crowded match.\n\
  \nOur mid-winter vacation to escape work had surprisingly turned into evading a\
  \ flurry of flirtations from the locals. \u2018Safe\u2019 spaces were tourist hot-spots\
  \ like the refreshing Piula Cave Pool and the vibrant Apia Flea Market. These places\
  \ were peppered with few foreigners; a delicious taste of feeling that we had stumbled\
  \ across some new secret sites. \n\nThe Red Rocket really showed us a good time\
  \ \u2013 belting out Samoan hits, drifting along the coast, climbing through lush\
  \ overgrown plantation, and boosting through a knee-deep ford. It took us on supermarket\
  \ trips to see aisles of super-sized Spam and waited patiently whilst we zipped\
  \ over to Manono Island on a motorboat, to bathe in a jaw-dropping sunset. This\
  \ was where we fell in love with island life and all of its unbridled beauty.\n\n\
  For our last afternoon, we went to the west side of Upolo and found an isolated\
  \ beach to top up our tans. While trying our hand at weaving from the fauna, a young\
  \ shirtless man magically appeared and offered to construct us a basket. He edged\
  \ closer to me as he asked more questions and left when he realised that his lines\
  \ were falling flat. It was getting easier to cut through the charm and cheese.\
  \ \n\nTo celebrate our week of relaxation and rejuvenation, we slipped into party\
  \ mode. It\u2019s surprisingly easy to go from snoozing to sipping on sweet tropical\
  \ cocktails in coconuts. Our evening out began on Rock Da Boat in the Apia harbour\
  \ - a floating nightclub with a DJ blaring dance music out into the starry skies\
  \ and a waitress passing around a large plate of fried chicken hors d\u2019oeuvres.\
  \ A group of fa\u2019afine cased the boat in search of fresh talent. Unsatisfied,\
  \ they opted for an early exit via water taxi back ashore. \n\nA week in Samoa was\
  \ like opening a Christmas morning stocking; filled with treasures that were all\
  \ surprises. Lounging off a hangover under an airport fale, we knew that we if we\
  \ had stayed any longer we could\u2019ve been married from a bus trip; living our\
  \ days playing volleyball off raffled land in one of the church lotteries and feasting\
  \ upon Spam and Tip Top ice cream. This was surprisingly, Samoa."
