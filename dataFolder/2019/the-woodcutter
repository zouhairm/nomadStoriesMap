Text: "I had never met anyone who had fought in a civil war before. \nWe were in the\
  \ front yard of Dragica\u2019s house, setting up the warped wooden table we had\
  \ just taken out of the shed. Her uncle Milutin and a couple of her friends were\
  \ coming for dinner. It was the hottest July central Serbia had seen in years, with\
  \ 34\xB0C that day, but outside it was slowly cooling down. I fetched a couple of\
  \ extra chairs while Dragica skirted the table and together we set up the mismatched\
  \ plates, glasses and cutlery. \n\n\tBack in the kitchen, she took a tray out of\
  \ the oven, handed me a fork and showed me how to s mash the eggplant while she\
  \ put the baked capsicums aside and filled them with a stuffing prepared in that\
  \ afternoon. Uncle Milutin was used to being far from men, she warned me. He lived\
  \ in a hut in the middle of a mountain, twenty kilometers north. The white rabbit\
  \ tattooed on her bare, plump shoulder hopped as she shrugged. \n\tShe put another\
  \ tray in the oven, a mix of sauerkraut and cabbage, and then sliced onions and\
  \ potatoes that she tossed in bowl with vinegar, sugar and oil. He had moved there\
  \ after the factory where he was employed had been bombed in 1999, during the Kosovo\
  \ War. He became a woodcutter. Twice a week he would walk down the mountain to sell\
  \ wood and see his daughter. \n\n\tMilutin was a short, broad-shouldered man in\
  \ his mid-fifties with the thick, lean muscles expected on much younger men. He\
  \ wore a faded kaki shirt over a white, yellowed singlet and a pair of brown shorts.\
  \ An olive-green beret covered his hair and deep wrinkles accentuated the strange\
  \ aura of wisdom on his sun-beaten face. While the other guests were drinking wine,\
  \ he drank lemonade and was silent while all were joking and laughing. His bright,\
  \ light-blue eyes were kind and inquisitive. \n\n\tAt the end of the meal he put\
  \ his beret on the table, brushed his hair back and smiled as he addressed his niece.\
  \ He seemed to be asking about me. Dragica replied in a few sentences. He gave a\
  \ nod of approval and said a few words.  \n\n        \u2018You are right to travel\
  \ the world,\u2019 Dragica translated. \n\nAnd then he spoke again, only pausing\
  \ to allow his niece to keep up with the translation. When he was my age, he was\
  \ Yugoslav, not Serb. His passport, like mine today, used to open all doors, thanks\
  \ to Tito\u2019s neutral stance during the Cold War, so Milutin had travelled the\
  \ world in his youth, with his girlfriend, and later with another. Then one day,\
  \ it stopped abruptly. Serbia waged three wars in less than a decade. He was forty-two\
  \ years old when he was sent to fight in Croatia.   \n\n\tEveryone around the table\
  \ had sobered up. Milutin took a sip of lemonade, and remained silent. He rolled\
  \ up his sleeves. I noticed the date 1992 tattooed on his forearm underneath a symbol\
  \ I had spotted on other Serbian men. I couldn't imagine what it would feel like\
  \ to go back home and be sent to war in my forties, having known peace all my life.\
  \  \n \n\tDragica inquired about the tattoo, on my behalf. Milutin put down his\
  \ empty glass and answered. Dragica\u2019s voice trembled as she translated: a big\
  \ mistake from his time as a soldier. We do things in life that we end up regretting\
  \ deeply. Under certain circumstances we believe that we don\u2019t have any other\
  \ choice. How many horrors has he witnessed, perhaps participated in, I wondered.\
  \ \n\nHe put his beret back on, stood up, and put his arm on my shoulder.\n\t\n\t\
  \u2018To follow everybody, to obey, is easier\u2019 he said. \n\nDragica translated.\
  \ He withdrew his arm and started clearing the table. He stopped and stared at me\
  \ with emotions I had never read in anyone\u2019s eyes, and then he walked inside\
  \ the house with a pile of plates in his hands."
