Text: "In the spring of 2016 I was in my final semester of graduate school, living\
  \ with my boyfriend of two and a half years, and beginning to apply to jobs for\
  \ after graduation. I was very comfortable, living a \"normal\" life for a 24-year-old\
  \ trying to line things up for the next phase of life after graduation. Then I was\
  \ unexpectedly offered a trip to South America and Antarctica when a spot became\
  \ available in a group to run in the Antarctica Marathon. Without hesitation but\
  \ with many nerves, I accepted. There's only so much you can do to prepare for not\
  \ only a trip you yourself have never taken but that most people will never take.\
  \ Being the type of person that likes to plan, I had to change my mindset for this\
  \ trip.\n\nBefore long, I was in a ballroom in a Buenos Aires hotel, meeting a group\
  \ of people from around the world whose passion for running inspires them to regularly\
  \ travel to new places. Later that week, I celebrated my 25th birthday with two\
  \ new friends in a quiet restaurant on Ushuaia's main strip. And in the following\
  \ two weeks, the new experiences only multiplied. I trusted my life to a crew aboard\
  \ a research vessel as we crossed the Drake Passage and to our tour leaders driving\
  \ small, inflated zodiac boats (which evidently leopard seals sometimes puncture\
  \ with their teeth). Scientists on board taught our band of runners about petrels,\
  \ penguins, seals, and whales; about glaciers and sea ice; and about the history\
  \ of Antarctica and how the political climates of many countries impact the research\
  \ that takes place on the continent. Our band of runners completed a cold and somewhat\
  \ dangerous race and - on a different day - many of us dared to dip our bodies into\
  \ the Antarctic Sea in a true-to-its-name \"polar plunge\".\n\nAnd then I arrived\
  \ home, back to the comfort of my regular life. Immediately I realized I wasn't\
  \ ready to give up on adventure and go back to my mindset as it was previously.\
  \ Thinking long and hard about the trajectory I was on, I decided to make a few\
  \ adjustments in order to keep the fire alive. I wanted to remain slightly uncomfortable.\n\
  \nThis desire to be uncomfortable took me to Ireland on a solo trip, where I made\
  \ a good friend in another female solo traveler from France. I fell so in love with\
  \ the country that I accepted a job offer and lived there for two years, where I\
  \ navigated life with different political, healthcare, and social systems. \n\n\
  The desire to be uncomfortable took me to the jungles of Myanmar, where I ate noodles\
  \ on the side of a road on a mountain as I swapped stories of travel and life with\
  \ a new friend from Hungary, whom remains a good friend to this day.\n\nThe desire\
  \ to be uncomfortable will soon take me to Mount Kilimanjaro, where I won't bathe\
  \ for over a week and I have only a slight idea of how I'll manage my toilet habits\
  \ or my long, greasy hair while on the mountain. But that's part of the fun, isn't\
  \ it: to figure it out, and to figure it out together with the people around you."
