Text: "In Canada, moving four-hundred miles from home doesn't even get you out of\
  \ the country\u2014but in a distance equivalent to some European countries, differences\
  \ can bloom in unpredictable places.\n\nAfter my final year of university, I decided\
  \ to enroll in the Explore program, an experience where students learn French while\
  \ traveling another region of the country. I'd never been further than an hour from\
  \ Toronto. Now, I was about to be seven hours from the entirety of my universe.\
  \ But I was still going to be in Canada, the country of my birth. How much changed\
  \ from one province to the next? This was an experience to try something new, but\
  \ I wasn\u2019t prepared for a small city in the heart of Quebec: Trois-Rivi\xE8\
  res, aka Three Rivers, where the Saint-Maurice River meets the Saint Lawrence. \n\
  \nThe residence housing the students backed onto a park, with a running trail winding\
  \ around the edge of the campus, across a street, and to the ridge of a hill, overlooking\
  \ an expanse of the city. While bingeing on buttery croissants and chocolate \xE9\
  clairs makes the soul happy, it doesn't do much for the stomach. I pulled out my\
  \ old running shoes, which I brought with zero intention of using, and started a\
  \ slow jog through the trees. Here, surrounded by narrow aspens, I might blink and\
  \ believe I was home. Approaching the street, everything started to shift.\n\nOn\
  \ my first night in Trois-Rivi\xE8res, my roommates and I walked to the plaza across\
  \ the street, the furthest we were willing to go after a day hopping from plane\
  \ to train to bus. A Canadian Tire sat opposite a Thai Express and a McDonald's.\
  \ A familiar sight, like we had never left our own corners of the country. Until\
  \ we came to the street and realized something terrifying: the laws of traffic as\
  \ we knew them no longer applied. \n\nGone was the blinking man, signalling safety\
  \ to cross. The lanes opposite each other didn't flow at the same time. Instead,\
  \ each of the four lanes took turns, one by one. North, East, South, West, repeat.\
  \ That night, a street corner almost became my home. My roommates and I stood transfixed\
  \ in confusion for nearly twenty minutes, until working up the nerve to make a mad\
  \ dash for the other side, at a time chosen more by hope than logic.\n\nLuckily,\
  \ everyone survived.\n\nThis time, jogging through the woods, I was alone, without\
  \ my roommates beside me, but a week had passed since that first night. Crossing\
  \ the street in Trois-Rivi\xE8res was now akin to how I crossed in Toronto, with\
  \ perhaps a pinch more danger. This single laneway was, quite literally, a walk\
  \ in the park. With a push of speed, I made it between one car and the next, the\
  \ woods and the campus at my back, the hill at my front. \n\nPeaking the hill, the\
  \ trees on the ridge faded away, revealing Trois-Rivi\xE8res before me. Slate-gray\
  \ roofed houses, some with above-ground pools and small decks, dotted the landscape,\
  \ a cookie-cutter village. But these weren\u2019t the detached homes I was used\
  \ to or even the townhouse-style semis found in some neighborhoods. These pale-paneled\
  \ homes were built one atop another, with towering, metal staircases leading to\
  \ the upper-floor units. It was a wonder half the population didn\u2019t tumble\
  \ down the precarious steps in the icy winters and spend the entire season in hospital\
  \ with broken bones. \n\nOverlooking Trois-Rivi\xE8res, I finally realized I wasn\u2019\
  t in a Canada I recognized. This mundane landscape had transformed into an alien\
  \ world in my eyes. I hadn\u2019t expected to find the unknown, but even close to\
  \ home, it exists in the simplest places. In a new location, anything can be reinvented,\
  \ turning what you\u2019ve always known into something extraordinary."
