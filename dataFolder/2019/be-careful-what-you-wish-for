Text: "We lock eyes. It looks angry. It is in the middle of the road. Am I in its\
  \ way or is it in mine? Rules of the road point towards the latter because IT is\
  \ a lot bigger than me.\n \nThe day before I had entered Khao Yai National Park\
  \ in Thailand with my husband Tim and 10 other adventurers.  We would be riding\
  \ our bicycles for 3 weeks through Thailand, Cambodia and Vietnam. The road to the\
  \ park entrance was nine miles long, all uphill in an endless series of curves.\
  \ \n \nBlessings for a safe journey had been bestowed on our bikes that morning\
  \ by a Buddhist monk in a temple in Bangkok. After arriving in the park we hiked\
  \ around scoffing at the signs warning of \u201Clions and tigers and bears, oh my\u201D\
  . We delighted in the macaque monkeys alongside the road and were disappointed by\
  \ the lone sighting of a porcupine during our \u201Cnight safari\u201D.\n \nEarly\
  \ the next morning Tim and I get on our bikes and leave as soon as there is light.\
  \ The zigzagging road to the exit is all downhill and Tim is quickly out of my sight.\
  \ I am blissfully enjoying the tranquility when from ahead of me I hear a trumpeting\
  \ sound. Baraag...baraag\u2026what is making that sound?... It kind of sounds like\u2026\
  .an... and as I round the next bend my suspicions are confirmed. It sounds like,\
  \ and is, an elephant.\n \nIt looks perturbed. It is not moving. I make a mental\
  \ spreadsheet -ride like the wind, stop, play dead? I conjure up every Planet Earth\
  \ show I have ever seen.  No clear answer emerges as momentum brings me directly\
  \ in front of the elephant. I call on karma and muster intense good will to convey\
  \ through my eyes that I am sorry, I mean no harm. Please don\u2019t hurt me. I\
  \ jump off my bike but my eyes never leave its eyes. I do not sense a flicker of\
  \ understanding or compassion for my predicament. I do notice that the elephant\u2019\
  s trunk is raising and that I am the intended recipient.\n \nMy eyes follow the\
  \ movement of the extended trunk reaching out towards my right shoulder. Thwap,\
  \ the trunk strikes me and with the force I am thrust off the road.  As I am rolling\
  \ I decide to play dead because I can\u2019t think of anything else to do. I remember\
  \ that my Aunt Carol believed that I had a guardian angel and I hope she is watching\
  \ now.\n \nAs I stop face down I cover my still bike-helmeted head with my hands.\
  \  I can sense that the elephant has followed me to my resting place and wants to\
  \ subdue me further. Out of the corner of my eye I see its foot lifting off the\
  \ ground and moving towards my prostrate body.  I will it not to crush me.and simultaneously\
  \ wonder whether Tim will remarry after I am gone and hope that I have not ruined\
  \ everyone\u2019s vacation.\n \nThe elephant\u2019s foot connects with my left shoulder.\
  \ The contact is firm but not obliterating. I brace myself for another blow but\
  \ none follows.  An interminable amount of time passes without a sound.\n\nAt last\
  \ the stillness is broken by the rumbling sound of a diesel engine approaching.\
  \ I picture my rescue vehicle until I realize with a sinking heart that the rumbling\
  \ is coming from the elephant, still in the road. FINALLY I hear my name being shouted\
  \ from whence I had come. I yell back that I am alive and soon after I hear a scuffle\
  \ and shouts.\n\nFrom the other direction I hear Tim\u2019s voice calling my name.\
  \ I crawl up the embankment and emerge from the bamboo forest to his incredulous\
  \ eyes. He is standing next to my bicycle with its twisted handlebars. Soon the\
  \ others join us and we trade perspectives, Rashomon-style. Their shouts to me distracted\
  \ the elephant and it charged them, stomping on a couple of bikes, before fleeing\
  \ into the forest. As our guide joins the group he proclaims that this is the happiest\
  \ moment in all of his guiding career and concludes by remarking, \u201CWell you\
  \ wanted to see an elephant!\u201D"
