Text: "Till 2016, I wasn\u2019t particularly eager upon travelling to North-East India,\
  \ I was prejudiced. I would have never known about the jewelled beauty of our land\
  \ if I hadn\u2019t kept my bias aside. Now when I consider, I feel embarrassed about\
  \ my subjective attitude. The place that left me to reevaluate my opinions, instilled\
  \ me to explore more of real India and altered the traveller in me is Mawlynnong\
  \ in Meghalaya. The charm of the place, the beauty of people and their drive to\
  \ keep the place clean brought an upheaval in me. This inspired me to encourage\
  \ responsible travelling. But yes this is not about me. This is about Mawlynnong,\
  \ a village in East Khasi Hills district of the state of Meghalaya, India. It was\
  \ awarded the \u201CCleanest Village in Asia\u201D in 2003 and till date, it has\
  \ retained the recognition of its award.\nAfter spending few days in Shillong, I\
  \ could not wait to reach and spend some time in this village, away from the urban\
  \ jungle. I had heard a lot about the two-tier living root bridge but it takes 4\
  \ hours to trek down. I wasn\u2019t informed, there was another single tier living\
  \ root bridge at Mawlynnong. When I reached, the first thing I wanted to have breakfast.\
  \ At a dead-end and there were two small huts. I was sipping water from a mineral\
  \ water bottle. When I wound up, a boy turned and gently advised me of putting the\
  \ bottle in a waste bin located near. I was dumbfounded by his attention and sensitivity.\
  \ Then he escorted me inside the village. I walked on the cobbled road flanked with\
  \ thatched Khasi huts and moved past the gardens adorned with colourful blooms.\
  \ Not only is this the cleanest village but one of the prettiest that I have seen.\
  \ To keep the village clean there is a bamboo basket outside every house. I was\
  \ greeted warmly in the guest house made of bamboo. The best part was I was in a\
  \ digital detoxification mode amidst the luxury of nature, there was no internet.\
  \ After my lunch, I went out for a walk and hiked down to the most spectacular natural\
  \ bridges made of roots of gigantic rubber tree. The roots make a pathway cross\
  \ a stream. The hardy roots have grown to form a cantilevered and intertwined mesh\
  \ helping villagers to commute. I was astounded to be face-to-face with one of the\
  \ living root bridges. This place is also kept clean and I was in awe to see kids\
  \ walking up and down removing fallen leaves and carrying water bottles for hikers.\
  \ What took me 45 mins to hike up back to the village, took less than 30 mins for\
  \ the kids. They guided me back to the village because it started raining. I realise\
  \ it\u2019s the simplicity and the warmth of the people that make Mawlynnong special.\
  \ They were beaming with happiness while serving me early dinner of rice, dal, potato\
  \ and red chillies. Cleanliness is a way of life here. All houses have functional\
  \ washrooms, plastic bags are banned, smoking is prohibited. The rules are strictly\
  \ followed and defaulters are charged heavily. The village gets its own manure which\
  \ is converted from the garbage dug into a pit. People not only keep their houses\
  \ clean, they step out to sweep roads and plant trees, which is a part of their\
  \ lifestyle. I was surprised in a very pleasant way to know, here the children of\
  \ the family get their mother\u2019s surname and the wealth is passed down from\
  \ the mother to the youngest daughter of the family. It\u2019s a living example\
  \ of women empowerment and the village has acquired 100 percent literacy rate. Since\
  \ this village is on the India-Bangladesh border, we are able to view the landscapes\
  \ of Bangladesh as well from the place. They have constructed an 85 feet high viewing\
  \ tower, but what\u2019s special is the tower is made of bamboo and you will be\
  \ overwhelmed with breathtaking views. What we expect in an urban society, but fail\
  \ to achieve, Mawlynnong has achieved it all. There is cleanliness and there is\
  \ simplicity."
