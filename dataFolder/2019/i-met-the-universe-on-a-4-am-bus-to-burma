Text: "I met the universe on a 4 a.m. bus to Burma for a visa bounce. It approached\
  \ shyly but my heart recognized it before even I consciously did so.\n\n\u201CHi\u201D\
  \ I said. He looked creeped out. Then was forced into the last seat on the bus next\
  \ to me.  I thought I\u2019d sleep until the border, but the little light and I\
  \ laughed all night until the blood moon sank heavy and the sun breached through\
  \ the Eastern Thai mountains. And when it did, we continued to weave laughter around\
  \ blurts of honesty and rawness, which is the best and only way to do it. We spent\
  \ eight hours on a sweaty bus packed with strangers. We were never strangers. \n\
  \nSix hours in we were talking creativity. He, a genius filmmaker. Myself, a writer.\
  \ He explained that sometimes he feels too unorganized to have motivation.\n\n\u201C\
  Maybe it\u2019s not that our tangible messes keep us from alignment, but our emotional\
  \ internal messes\". \n\nWhen we don\u2019t have solid practices of connecting to\
  \ ourselves we feel disoriented and disconnected from our calling. We don\u2019\
  t have access to the stream of our subconscious, the river beneath the river. Stagnant.\
  \ Standing in a cloud of fog throwing spaghetti at walls that we can\u2019t even\
  \ see.\n\nWe don\u2019t live as if to be led, and that is, perhaps, the big tragedy\
  \ of mankind. The universe is all the time, everyday screaming and flailing its\
  \ arms trying to get our attention, to lead us where we are meant to be, and we\
  \ do everything in our power to look away from the path ahead.\n\nWe squander our\
  \ emotions and call it noble. We dilute our truth with tonics. We fear solitude\
  \ like it might just eat us alive. We cage ourselves as to divert adventure and\
  \ risk. \n\nWe are stuck in inaction. \n\nFeeling in alignment with my path is the\
  \ best feeling I\u2019ve ever known. Like wandering through back streets of Spain,\
  \ being lead by some electricity pulling you left and right down street corridors\
  \ and into lush gardens. \n\nIt\u2019s pure. It\u2019s flow.\n\nThat is how our\
  \ lives were intended to unfold in every second of every day.\n\nBut to access that,\
  \ we have to be better listeners.\n\nAnd that takes time and practice and solitude.\n\
  \nThere are times when I feel like I\u2019m writing poems and feeding them to a\
  \ black hole. There are times when I wonder if the self-care work I am passionate\
  \ about is a denial of \u201Creal adult life\u201D or I\u2019m the only sensitive\
  \ hussy who needs it out here.\n\nBut the more I acknowledge that fear, the more\
  \ people reach out to me in need of guidance. I am not a guide. I only have a tool\
  \ bag of tools that clean out people\u2019s ears to hear to the guide within themselves.\n\
  \nThe universe says to me every day, Hold on, tootsie pop. We need people like you\
  \ here doing this work.\n\nIn strangers on buses and friends feeling lost and seeking\
  \ connection.\n\nDO YOUR INNER WORK! I want to shout from the mountain tops. But\
  \ I can\u2019t. It comes with the unfolding and everyone must learn the lessons\
  \ themselves. Ahh, the mystery and the magic of metamorphosis.\n\nI trust it. I\
  \ trust that by helping myself, I help the world.\n\nSo friend, if you feel lost,\
  \ if you feel stagnant and hurt, disorganized, and anxious, it is a blessing. It\
  \ is your emotions guiding you into your inner world, where finally you can embark\
  \ on the real journey. \n\nIf we drop in daily to our hearts, we get to co-create\
  \ our lives with universal grace. We are unshackled from this place of inaction.\
  \ Fear releases its grip from around our necks. We drop in. And that dropping in\
  \ is thrilling.\n\nAnd when the universe meets you on a 4 AM. bus to Burma, you\
  \ will recognize it deep in your bones and sing music into a dark and dirty kind\
  \ of night."
