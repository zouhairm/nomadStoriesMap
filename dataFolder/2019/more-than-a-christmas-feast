Text: "On Christmas morning I woke up to gut-wrenching news. \u201CChelsey,\u201D\
  \ my boyfriend said tentatively, \u201Cmy aunt and uncle\u2019s house has been flooded.\u201D\
  \ My throat tightened as I tried to make sense of his words. This was my first Christmas\
  \ outside of Canada. I had recently joined him and his family in Davao, Philippines.\
  \  Tropical Storm Vinta, had fiercely flooded parts of the southern island, Mindanao.\
  \ My initial plans to relax at the pool seemed ridiculous when faced with the reality\
  \ his family was just dealt. \n\nUpon arriving to their suburb, I found myself knee\
  \ deep in murky, muddy water that crinkled my nose from its musty scent. As I took\
  \ each step, I found myself bumping into household items and other random debris;\
  \ forcing me to cautiously consider each movement. All around me, people scurried\
  \ about, trying to save their personal possessions while others urgently swept mud\
  \ from their homes. The sound of animals in distress filled the air; roosters screeched\
  \ and dogs bellowed.\n\nWe climbed our way up the slippery, mud-caked steps to his\
  \ uncle\u2019s house and my heart sank as my eyes processed the damage in front\
  \ of me. I pitched in and began collecting delicate family photos. I tenderly wiped\
  \ off mud and debris and lay them down on a clean sheet to dry. These photos offered\
  \ a glimpse into years of memories including birthdays and Christmas celebrations\
  \ of the past. Wooden floors heaved while walls bubbled and distorted from the saturation\
  \ of mud and water. The pile of furniture collecting in the corner looked worse\
  \ for wear. \n\nAfter hours of sorting and salvaging, we waded carefully back through\
  \ the flooded streets. As an obvious foreigner, I was aware of the local residents\
  \ noticing me. I wondered what they thought of me being in the middle of this and\
  \ I felt guilty knowing that I eventually had a safe home to return to. My eyes\
  \ locked with some people who were cleaning out their homes and to my surprise,\
  \ I was met with many smiles. I blinked back hot tears and took deep breaths as\
  \ people waved and wished me Merry Christmas. \n \nLater that evening, as we shared\
  \ stories from the day\u2019s events over a traditional Filipino meal, my boyfriend\u2019\
  s aunt comforted me by stating \u201CAll these things can be replaced but we cannot.\
  \ Let us celebrate and be thankful for that which we have.\u201D I looked around\
  \ at my new friends and family who were laughing joyfully. I knew this was going\
  \ to be a very different Christmas from what I was accustomed to but I could never\
  \ predict just how unique this one would be."
