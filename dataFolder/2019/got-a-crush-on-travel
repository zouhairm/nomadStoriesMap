Text: "So it is about 3 years ago when I decided to see my sister after a long time\
  \ since she settled abroad leaving all her childhood memories behind. Of course\
  \ she was married with an IT expert who had high level of ambitions in life and\
  \ why not. She herself is from the same back round so found him to be the best match.\
  \ Soon after, they were blessed with a baby boy who now is 13years old. So this\
  \ is about Australia. They say if you want to feel all climate at once, Melbourne\
  \ is the place to be and if you don't like the current climate situation, wait for\
  \ five minutes ;)\nThey are right. I didn't expect to feel all type of weather conditions\
  \ like rain and cold then wind and sun at once but I thank God for giving me strength\
  \ to quit my job and apply for Visa though of course it is very difficult for a\
  \ working person to be random like this but today, I couldn't be more happy of that\
  \ decision.\nThe moment we landed, we were greeted so well that I wanted to just\
  \ hug the airport staff and really, they made the immigration so easy that I couldn't\
  \ feel any less then India. Guys, I know Australia is badly known for racism, trust\
  \ me, it's not true!\nEver heard of be good, find good? It works!\nSo when we stepped\
  \ out, I found my sister, her son and my brother standing out and since the pool\
  \ of emotion got so high, we shouted, cried and wrapped around each other so much\
  \ that even Australians who were waiting for there beloved ones started to feel\
  \ a little numb.\nWe took a taxi and drove to my sister's place and while on the\
  \ way to her home, I could see my travelling dream coming true. It was so much good.\n\
  \nThere is a biggie that I didn't narrate here, butterflies in the stomach?\n\n\
  While being on the plane, there was a person I noticed who was noticing me as well!\
  \ \nA person who when I looked at, felt like I have been knowing him from ages.\
  \ Not really but felt like :)\n\nToday, he is my boy friend and we are planning\
  \ to take our personal and travel life to take a step ahead.\n\nBut picture abhi\
  \ baaki hai mere dost!"
