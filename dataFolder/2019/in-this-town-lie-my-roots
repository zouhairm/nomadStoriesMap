Text: "I woke up to the sound of a rooster. It was still dark and surprisingly cold\
  \ considering the fact that I was in The Dominican Republic. Today the people of\
  \ this town were \u201Cwalking the saint\u201D ... whatever that meant. I stepped\
  \ out of the room to find that everyone was already getting ready. My great-aunt\
  \ handed me a bucket and a towel, and took me to the backyard were I was supposed\
  \ to take a shower. I was still half-a-sleep, it was cold, and I was about to take\
  \ a shower in a backyard with a bucket of ice cold water. \n\n      As we walked\
  \ out of the house I could see people already making their way to the church. This\
  \ was Banica. The place my mom had always talked to me about. A young man had brought\
  \ out the statue of the Saint: San Francisco de Asis, the patron of this little\
  \ town. I quickly noticed his missing thumb. I knew the story behind it. Apparently\
  \ my mom had broken it as a child. We started walking. People were singing and chanting\
  \ and I was too tired to make out the words to the songs. As we walked, I noticed\
  \ the houses. They were small and painted in many shades of blues, pinks and greens.\
  \ Most of them had zinc roofs that looked like the wavy lays chips my cousin Javier\
  \ likes to eat. I dozed off trying to block out the singing from the crowd and suddenly,\
  \ all of the stories my mom had told me about her childhood had started to come\
  \ to life. \n     \n           We passed by the park were I could see my aunts and\
  \ uncles laughing and playing on the sun clock. We turned the corner were my great-grandmother\
  \ was selling selling lottery tickets and caf\xE9 con leche in her bodega. Then\
  \ we came upon my grandparent\u2019s old house. It was painted in a peach color\
  \ and despite its humble and simplistic look, I found that it looked welcoming.\
  \ Here I saw my mom sitting on a branch of her favorite limoncillo tree and my grandfather\
  \ playing his trumpet in the living room. We walked further, stumbling on rocks\
  \ and at that point, I was regretting the fact that I had chosen to wear sandals.\
  \ Finally, we had reached a river. The famous Artibonito, on the other side of this\
  \ river was Haiti. The current was strong and the river was bordered by Framboyan\
  \ trees in bright shades reds and yellows. \nI sat down on a big rock to rest. It\
  \ was mid-day and it had already started to get hot. I dipped my feet into the cool\
  \ water and I envisioned yet again, another one of my mom\u2019s anecdotes. In front\
  \ of me I saw my grandmother washing her family\u2019s clothes. She was knelt down\
  \ on the edge of the river and she had stopped to pull back her hair away from her\
  \ face. She then laid each garment that she had washed on the big rocks to dry,\
  \ and as she waited, she talked to the other women that had also come to the river\
  \ to do laundry.  \n\nI sat there admiring the scenery. The sun was burning my shoulders\
  \ and the current of the river was running through my feet. We had finished our\
  \ walk. People were now eating and dancing. I thought about my shower that morning;\
  \ in the backyard, with cold bucket of water and I thought to myself \u201CIn this\
  \ town lie my roots,\u201D as I smiled and stepped into the river."
