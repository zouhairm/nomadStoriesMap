Text: "I just woke up on Sunday, still the weekend, asking myself what I\u2019m going\
  \ to do today? I barely know Munster now. Let\u2019s start walking and running around\
  \ and go back to prepare myself for another week in Germany. \nSo, it will be a\
  \ walk for just half an hour.\nTake little things with me, phone, headphones, small\
  \ amount of money, bus ticket (in case I lose the directions).\n\nWhich direction\
  \ will I take? Actually it doesn\u2019t matter that much as the whole city is beautiful\
  \ and I trust my feet, every time they take me to a new direction of my destiny.\n\
  \nI keep walking till I find myself in the old city. It\u2019s one of my favorite\
  \ places here, the old architecture, the stone road and I always wonder how it has\
  \ been reconstructed like this after World War II.\n\nI walked till I found many\
  \ of metal safety barriers, many people around the place, music and sound system\
  \ and people around the barriers who looked like they are waiting or just watching.\
  \ I don\u2019t know exactly. I forgot about my walk a little bit and had some curiosity\
  \ what is this about. I stopped there trying to figure out by myself but I can\u2019\
  t make sure if it is just a sport event or something else . I tried to ask the old\
  \ woman beside me but she couldn\u2019t speak English. I moved to walk through narrow\
  \ lanes to come closer. I walked and asked again a young girl who could barely speaks\
  \ English to tell me with sporadic words \u201CMarathon, 42 km\u201D. Now I know\
  \ what I\u2019m looking at.  It looks interesting and I\u2019ve never watched a\
  \ marathon before. Let\u2019s change my plan and stay a little bit longer to watch\
  \ it.\n\nIndividuals, couples and groups participated in the Marathon and here they\
  \ came to the end point where others were waiting for them. Some of them were clapping,\
  \ some of them were worrying but it\u2019s like all people came to support. Actually\
  \ me too, At the begging I was just staying to watch and observe the event but then\
  \ while every participant came to the end, I found myself smiling, clapping , or\
  \ even warring about those people, who look so tired and weak but also so strong\
  \ to fight themselves and continue to the end.\nThis little girl who participated\
  \ with her mother was so close to the ending point and her body was fighting with\
  \ vomiting and her mom never stopped encouraging her and never told her to quit!\
  \ \nI walked again to come closer and maybe find another inspirational stories and\
  \ I found an old man holding the metal barrier who was just waiting without being\
  \ bored.\n\nKids holding cute instruments to express their support, and there was\
  \ a whole family who was waiting at the beginning of the reception line. I found\
  \ worried parents on the other side who were holding a cheering sign. I asked the\
  \ young woman who was beside me about them because it seemed that they were supporting\
  \ and waiting for the same person. And she told me that they are waiting for their\
  \ daughter who is participating for the first time.\n\nTime passing and it seem\
  \ like most of participants arrived. Worry has been increased in this family\u2019\
  s eyes especially the parents but it seemed that they have never lost their faith\
  \ in this girl.\nI became more curious to wait for this girl even if the event seems\
  \ like has already finished. \nSuddenly I found one of those family members holding\
  \ two little girls and making them jump over the barrier to walk with the expected\
  \ girl the rest of the way. Yes she came. I took a look to the parents to find the\
  \ mother crying and the father holding the sign, the whole family showing their\
  \ all support and pride of her.\n\n\nOn my way back with this unexpected inspiration\
  \ I kept thinking and actually believing that we all need people who believe in\
  \ us, wait, support and showing their support in another kind of marathons that\
  \ have more obstacles and ups and downs, The Marathon of life."
