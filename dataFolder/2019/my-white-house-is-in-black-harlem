Text: "Whenever I ask people about their experience of big city life, they often tell\
  \ me how much they love the anonymity associated with it. They treasure being able\
  \ to encounter hundreds of strangers per day and remain unwatched by them. To them,\
  \ constantly being looked at (but not seen) somehow makes them feel vulnerable yet\
  \ concealed in a pleasurable way. I can never relate to this. As an international\
  \ student from Botswana, a third-world country, I've only lived in Montreal for\
  \ about a year and have already discovered big city life to sometimes feel cold,\
  \ hostile and isolating. I can understand why there is a comfort in remaining unknown\
  \ - but I also understand that if people don't know you, they also don't care about\
  \ you. Anonymity can often equal irrelevance. \n\nBefore visiting New York City\
  \ in February, I'd been living in Montreal for only a year. Montreal, often described\
  \ as the boiling pot of North American and European cultures, had definitely been\
  \ a dazzling experience, but what I hadn't expected was how idiosyncratic French-Canadian\
  \ culture was compared to American culture. Or at least, compared to the American\
  \ culture I'd seen on TV whilst growing up in Botswana. After a year, even though\
  \ I'd fallen in love with Montreal, I'd decided that it was to time to witness a\
  \ more full and familiar account of the so-called \"North American experience.\"\
  \ So I saved up and took a trip to New York City. With three hundred dollars in\
  \ my wallet, I stayed with my friend at her university's residence building for\
  \ seven nights. \n\nBefore visiting New York City, I'd often heard of it being referred\
  \ to as its own 'bubble' that is politically and culturally separated from the rest\
  \ of America. Upon arriving and regarding its size, I immediately realized this\
  \ is wrong - it's not a bubble, it's a planet. Walking through one neighborhood\
  \ feels like walking through the smallest part of an entire world. There is an infinitude\
  \ of things to do constantly unraveling around of you- whether in the form of multi-cultural\
  \ caf\xE9's, sullen yet entrancing jazz bars, or relaxing city parks. On my first\
  \ night, my friend invited me to a poetry slam at Nuyorican Poets Caf\xE9, in Manhattan's\
  \ East Village. Among the poetry slam line-up were various immigrant poets and poets\
  \ of color. I found it quite beautifully ironic that my first night in Trump's America\
  \ was at a show where the performers passionately celebrated multiculturalism, ethnic\
  \ diversity and immigration. All of my anxieties about being a black African traveler\
  \ (who is also gay) in America were immediately calmed. The ambience of the poets\
  \ caf\xE9 was divine - outside, a painting of Jimi Hendrix sings at you to enter.\
  \ Even though the building seems old and historical, once you've entered, the atmosphere\
  \ is contemporary. There is a well-equipped bar and a moderate seating area, amphitheater-style,\
  \ surrounding a stage where you can hear poets and musicians from different ethnic\
  \ backgrounds celebrating and lamenting life in America. After the show, my friend\
  \ and I headed to a queer party at the Knockdown Centre - an art center in Queens.\
  \ I was again amazed by the mixture of modernity and ancientness - beneath the medieval-looking\
  \ golden chandeliers were punks in fishnets dancing to electronic music. So far\
  \ this wasn't the New York I had expected, but the one I had secretly wished for.\n\
  \nBut the pivotal moment of my trip was my day in Harlem. In 1984, the president\
  \ of Burkina Faso, Thomas Sankara, visited NYC and said in a speech: \"Every African\
  \ Head of State who comes to New York must first pass through Harlem - that is why\
  \ we consider that our White House is in Black Harlem.\"\nI felt this sense of welcoming\
  \ immediately. I walked through the streets for only a few moments, and was bathed\
  \ in the warmth of strangers smiling at me, singing to themselves as they walked\
  \ the street, dancing to music in their headphones etc. I entered the 'Red Rooster'\
  \ restaurant, which boasted a casual interior with an Afro-Caribbean aesthetic.\
  \ After ordering my food, I spotted an unexpected connection to home - a painting\
  \ of Nelson Mandela on the wall. Suddenly, I felt all of my anonymity dissapearing."
