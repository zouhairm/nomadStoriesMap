Text: "I\u2019ve been to Europe three times in my life (so far). The first time I\
  \ visited Europe was because of a boy (isn\u2019t that how all great romances begin?).\
  \ I was 23, and in a very long-distance relationship with a wonderful boy from Sion\
  \ Mills, Northern Ireland. It was quite the serious relationship, and I spent the\
  \ summer of 2009 with him there, so as to meet his family properly. While the relationship\
  \ wasn\u2019t meant to be, my love affair with travel started that summer. Together,\
  \ we explored Londonderry and Dublin on foot. I got to see the scars that were still\
  \ left by the Troubles. I got to drink Guinness straight from the source. It was\
  \ a truly enlightening experience. \n\nMy next foray overseas was for a study abroad\
  \ trip to Ukraine in 2012. On that trip, I got to explore Kiev and live with a host\
  \ family for the duration of my stay. I also added Ukraine, Poland and Germany to\
  \ my growing collection of passport stamps. While I love travel, Ukraine was my\
  \ first country to be deposited in without at least a rudimentary ability to communicate\
  \ (or even read) in the language of the country. It was VERY disconcerting, to say\
  \ the least. The most valuable lessons I learned on this trip were 1) always use\
  \ a real toilet before an 11-hour flight, and 2) sparkling water is nearly indistinguishable\
  \ from still water when the label is in Polish. \n\nMy most recent trip was the\
  \ trip of a lifetime. In November of 2018, I planned the most amazing trip for my\
  \ grandmother, my boyfriend, and myself. For fifteen days, we traipsed across England,\
  \ Scotland, France, the Netherlands and Iceland. I got to walk down the streets\
  \ of the Beatles\u2019 Liverpool, see the mountains of Glencoe, visit Anne Frank\
  \ House, stand at the top of the Eiffel Tower on the 100th anniversary of Armistice\
  \ Day, see the Christmas lights on Oxford Street and Shakespeare\u2019s birthplace,\
  \ the total darkness at 10am in Grindavik, Iceland, and I even drove in both England\
  \ (terrifying) and Iceland. This was the kind of trip that makes the return to everyday\
  \ life in Oklahoma seem impossible. \n\nBecause of these experiences, I\u2019ve\
  \ grown restless\u2014desperate to accrue more vacation leave (I used something\
  \ like 92 hours in November on my last trip) so that I can plan my next adventure.\
  \ I\u2019m a firm believer in the Tolkien poem line, \u201CNot all those who wander\
  \ are lost.\u201D \n\nI am a wanderer, and I would love to encourage readers to\
  \ a life of wandering."
