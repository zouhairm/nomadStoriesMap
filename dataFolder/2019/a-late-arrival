Text: "It's dark, and it's late. Too late, most would say, for this part of the world,\
  \ where guides say 'give it a miss' and governments say 'do not travel'. Where journalists,\
  \ less hyperbolic, simply state the facts: \u2018India's poorest state.\u2019\n\n\
  I arrived at the border at 8, but it's approaching midnight by the time I make it\
  \ across. Bribes demanded, bribes denied, a lengthy negotiation culminating in an\
  \ eventual welcome. I\u2019m sick, tired and alone. My train left long ago. \n\n\
  The immigration officer got out of bed to stamp me in, a late arrival well past\
  \ closing time. He\u2019s dressed for this weather, possibly even overdressed: vest,\
  \ hat, scarf, jacket. Maybe he\u2019s sick too. At this time of year, when the fog\
  \ sets in and holds the layer pollution low over the land, only the very lucky stay\
  \ healthy.\n\nIt\u2019s only the officer and me, so I ask him for directions. I\
  \ no longer have business at the station, but I have nowhere else to go. I\u2019\
  m half hoping for a lift, but settle instead for enthusiastic arm-waving and a few\
  \ words of encouragement. \u2018Turn right at the crossing,\u2019 he says, \u2018\
  and just walk along the tracks. You can\u2019t miss it.\u2019\n\nI love a good shortcut,\
  \ especially at a time like this, and I take his advice. Down the dusty road, under\
  \ the gate at the level crossing, out on to the tracks. There\u2019s a well-worn\
  \ path by the rails and I follow it, taking confidence from the fact that it\u2019\
  s there. I might be alone now, I think, but I\u2019m not the only idiot to have\
  \ given this a try.\n\nThe dirt path meanders left and right as the tracks diverge,\
  \ converge and diverge again, giving trains the chance to sort themselves into platforms.\
  \ The pollution holds just enough of the city light for me not to lose the path\
  \ as it wanders around thickets, over mounds, and eventually ends at what looks\
  \ like the start of a platform. An elevated concrete path, unadorned, no more than\
  \ a metre wide. I climb the metal stairs and walk between two empty trains. I hear\
  \ distant clinks and scrapes: people scraping together a living from whatever the\
  \ empty carriages have to offer.\n\nFour young men appear. They approach me, just\
  \ to say hello. They\u2019re friendly enough: they fix their hair by phonelight\
  \ and we take a couple of selfies. I ask the way and they point to the other side\
  \ of the tracks. The bad side of the tracks.\n\nThe words of the immigration officer\
  \ in my ear, I ignore them. I try to project confidence as I bid them goodnight\
  \ and walk for five, six, ten more minutes along the concrete path, expecting a\
  \ station that never comes. Instead I reach a dead end: the concrete stops abruptly,\
  \ trains on two sides, a steep drop ahead.\n\nIt\u2019s only now that I notice how\
  \ high this narrow platform is. It\u2019s risen as I\u2019ve walked and is now a\
  \ few metres above the ground, more than I can jump. Not prepared to go back, I\
  \ try a couple of train doors, and one opens obligingly. I walk through an open\
  \ train, then another, to a platform closer to the ground. The trains are soaked\
  \ on the inside, and I belatedly realise I\u2019m in the cleaning yard. Nothing\
  \ here but concrete, pipes, and dripping trains. It\u2019s surreal to see these\
  \ moving cities, usually so alive, so dead.\n\nNow I can see the edge of the yard,\
  \ and I\u2019m willing to take the plunge. It\u2019s still a few feet to the grass\
  \ below, but I see a way out now, so I dangle my feet off the concrete and let myself\
  \ go.\n\nSplash.\n\nThe grass isn\u2019t grass but sludge, knee high, slightly thicker\
  \ than water, a thick layer of moss on top. Whatever comes out of an Indian train\
  \ when you hose it down. I stop myself from taking that thought any further.\n\n\
  I wade across the sludge, climb stairs, jump another platform, climb a fence, find\
  \ solid ground. The station isn\u2019t far from here, I see its bright lights up\
  \ ahead. As a place to spend a night, it suddenly seems like heaven."
