Text: "Stairway to heaven (or hell), Varanasi is a place where people are taken when\
  \ they are dead. I was there because I wanted to feel alive. Hindu traditions mark\
  \ Varanasi as the place where souls embrace carelessness and float away in nothingness.\
  \ I wanted my soul to embrace carefreeness and float away in reality. \n\nOn one\
  \ late afternoon during my week-long trip, I start strolling through the very lively\
  \ lanes that lead to the famous Assi ghats, imbibing the beautiful chaos of the\
  \ narrow, unkept streets. The sound of mantras being chanted in temples around transport\
  \ you to a magical land. The stench of urine drags you back to reality. Motorbikes\
  \ and rickshaws hastily carry people and their dreams from one destination to another,\
  \ reminding you to not get in their way. An invaluable lesson in the art of living,\
  \ I suppose. People are carrying out mundane, everyday chores of life with a zest\
  \ that is infectious. Shopkeepers and sellers are hospitably aggressive in selling\
  \ all sorts of rainbow-hued things, ascertaining the Darwinian \u2018survival of\
  \ the fittest\u2019 theory. \n\nI could hear the subdued tones of divine River Ganga\
  \ flow at a distance. I walked aimlessly as if almost sure that the winds would\
  \ guide me to where I belong. I knew in my heart that my destination isn\u2019t\
  \ far. More so, I knew it in my head because I had put it up on GPS. I was more\
  \ than sure that it would guide me in the right direction. Calculative recklessness\
  \ is called smartness when you are a solo, female traveler. \n\nI was on the lookout\
  \ for a rustic caf\xE9 called Pizzeria that overlooks the serene waters of the ghat.\
  \ I fancied watching the sunset in solitude, sipping a good, caramel-flavored milkshake,\
  \ and engaging in the luxury of contemplation while surrounded by wise words of\
  \ men from ancient times. Instead, I found myself perched on the stairs of the ghat\
  \ that was abundantly dotted with people, without any drinks to satiate my thirst,\
  \ and distracted by the clamored, unimportant banter of boatmen. GPS (and the winds)\
  \ had failed me as I was unable to locate the caf\xE9. \n\nI resisted all thoughts\
  \ of dejection and chose to make peace with my present surrounding. After all, that\
  \ is what I had come to the city for- to embrace reality with open arms. \n\nWe\
  \ were all gathered there in solidarity to share this end of another day. As soon\
  \ as I felt the absence of something to sip on, a shabbily dressed boy, not older\
  \ than 10 years, stepped beside me clinking glasses of lemon tea. I knew he was\
  \ God-sent. He adorned white teeth that shone from behind his playful smile. \u201C\
  Didi\u201D, he called, and extended a glass of hot tea. Chirpily reciprocating his\
  \ smile, I accepted the glass and asked for his name.\n\n Guddu Rangeela, he announced.\
  \  \n\nI noticed his eyes gleaming and for a moment wished to be able to look at\
  \ the world through those eyes. He did not shy away from letting me into his childhood\
  \ when I asked about his whereabouts. His mother had left the house when he was\
  \ two. His father works as a labor in a nearby factory and is often not home. He\
  \ spoke with a sage-like casualness that sounded liberating. \n\nI let him go, handing\
  \ him some money I had in my pocket. He walked further and then stopped to count\
  \ his earnings. He looked back and we shared a hearty smile. He had earned enough\
  \ to happily enjoy a few ice-creams for the day. \n\nI spent some more time embracing\
  \ my companionship amidst the beautiful chaos of the ghats of Varanasi. I understood\
  \ that the most carefree way to live life came through acceptance- of self, and\
  \ its reality. I didn\u2019t expect to come face to face with life and have it smile\
  \ back at me through Guddu.\n\nTwilight had come, and I calmly gathered my thoughts.\
  \ Misty-eyed and ready to depart, I was positive that this unpleasantness that dawned\
  \ on me now, will bring light to the deepest and darkest corners of my being and\
  \ drive my curiosity in a direction that is entirely mine. \n\nHar Har Mahadev!"
