Text: "\u201CI don\u2019t like any of this food!\u201D - my five-year-old daughter\
  \ said after our first meal in Piracanga, Brazil, declaring it would not be easy\
  \ our one-month standing there. We had just started our family sabbatical year:\
  \ my husband and I together with our two kids (the girl who did not like the food\
  \ and her two-year-old brother). \n\nPiracanga is an intentional community in the\
  \ northeast of Brazil. Intentional community means that people who lives there chose\
  \ to do it and are committed to some values and rules the place have: vegan meals,\
  \ solar power (what means no refrigerator at homes, no hairdryers, low use of electrical\
  \ devices such as notebooks and cellphones, hot showers only when the sun is helping),\
  \ only biodegradable products and cosmetics, no alcohol and no drugs, no disposable\
  \ products (which for us meant no regular diapers!). \n\nBut is it only a place\
  \ of NO\u2019s? Fortunately, NO! If you arrive there by boat, you will first see\
  \ a wonderful and conserved sea, followed by a white-sand beach, which finish in\
  \ a natural river together with a coconut grove. It has a stunning natural environment,\
  \ which were preserved and also improved by the local community. \n\nBesides the\
  \ amazing natural scenario, the community is working on developing new forms of\
  \ society arrangements, running a holistic center, one of the most innovative schools\
  \ of Brazil to its children, their own bank and financial system, vegan restaurants\
  \ and cafes, and working on water conservation, reforestation, permaculture and\
  \ artistic projects. All together with fantastic and very receptive people, mainly\
  \ from Brazil, but also internationally mixed. \n\nAnd how was this month there\
  \ for us? We arrived to participate on a volunteer program called \u201CSeva School\u201D\
  , in which my husband worked 3 hours during the morning and I worked 3 hours during\
  \ the afternoon. Our routine was settled basically towards seva work and kids arrangements,\
  \ beginning on sunrise and finishing some hours after sunset, as there were no lights\
  \ on the paths (I would say streets, but definitely they did not were like streets\
  \ we are used to). \n\nWithout refrigerator, we had to plan very carefully our meals,\
  \ going to the local market 4 times a week, what lead to a fresh and basically organic\
  \ food and it turned to be delicious for everybody! We are not vegan, and so we\
  \ had to learn a lot of vegan recipes to ensure the variation to kids and also for\
  \ us. After all, it was very good not to have refrigerator!\n\nWhat was a real deal:\
  \ laundry! As our son was on diapers, we changed for cloth (non-disposable) diapers\
  \ during the time, and so we had to wash 5-6 diapers per day without washing machine,\
  \ together with our regular clothes (in our bags we carry clothes for 10 days, which\
  \ means we have to wash every week). To turn this deal into fun, we invited the\
  \ kids to join us on the task and as with all concerned to water-playing, they loved\
  \ this! The same happened to the cold shower, we created a play game associated\
  \ to the shower-time, so they also turned the bad into a lot of fun!\n\nWe learnt\
  \ a lot from being out of our comfort zone, but this we already know from our previous\
  \ trips. What was new for us is that at the beginning of our sabbatical year, we\
  \ were very concerned about the kids and how they would face the changes. And this\
  \ first destiny show us that actually they deal much better than us adults, and\
  \ also has a lot to teach us how to have a new and fresh look to the world. \n\n\
  They are inspiring and great adventures! Sometimes they stuck in the beginning,\
  \ but after our month there I could hear from my daughter in our last meal there:\
  \ \u201CI more or less like this food. If we live here, I think I will love it!\u201D"
