Text: "The first time stepping off the bus in Vietnam's second largest city, there's\
  \ an almost instantaneous reaction to the body. The thick warm air surrounds you\
  \ like a blanket, waking you from the 8 hour overnight state previously known, eyes\
  \ glued, hair misplaced, as if to welcome you to Ho Chi Minh City. The sounds of\
  \ engines and motorbikes ring across your face in a crescendo of senses, dragging\
  \ your attention left, right, then forward when the gap quickly arises. There's\
  \ an unwritten rule to the roads here; walk straight and don't hesitate, the locals\
  \ are much more accustomed to evading you than you are them. On the other side of\
  \ the road, the sparks of fire and smells of pork, chicken, beef fill the air; the\
  \ fresh scent of coriander and thai basil dance across your palate in a wave, enticing\
  \ you over. Pho bo, pho ga, banh mi, bun moc, bun mam, all made in front of you,\
  \ behind a smile. You sit on the plastic stool, knees to your chin and wait, bringing\
  \ with it anticipation of the first experience of life-changing Vietnamese street\
  \ food. The smile is reciprocated as you lean into the warm, silky broth; delicate\
  \ spices, fragrant leaves and a calculated combination of craft and care go into\
  \ one bowl of pho, as for the local people here, food is communication, hospitality\
  \ and culture.\n\n\"I didn't expect to find love here\", you thought. \n\nAfter\
  \ locating your hostel, you leave your bags in the room and begin to meander through\
  \ District 1, and find yourself at on of the large openings of Ben Tanh Market.\
  \ The stalls and ceilings to this famous cornucopia are awash with colour and splendour.\
  \ Traditional reds, oranges, yellows melt above you in a sensational spectacle,\
  \ and fantastic fabrics flow across the walls like embroidery. Beneath them lanterns\
  \ line the floor as if directing a plane at night in purples, blues and burgundy,\
  \ and the local traders are excited and animated to show you their goods. There's\
  \ an amazing energy in these halls, one that's hard to ignore, and you find yourself\
  \ engaging with every striking piece you find, every garment that catches your eye,\
  \ when suddenly the gaze is broken and one scent takes over. A saccharine swell\
  \ comes over you and the smell of freshly roasted coffee entices you through the\
  \ crowd. Eventually the stall is revealed through the sea of people and there sits\
  \ an elderly woman, silent, humble, as if waiting for something. As you approach\
  \ the stall the scent becomes stronger and stronger and you proceed with \"ch\xE0\
  o ch\u1ECB\". The elderly woman rustles in her chair and gestures to the tables\
  \ behind her. Row upon row of perfect jars of every coffee imaginable; honey coffee\
  \ and vanilla, coffee from the high mountains, coffee from the tropical region of\
  \ Dalat, coffee from the digestive system of a weasel. A smile grows across her\
  \ face to mimic yours as your amazement becomes hard to conceal. The woman offers\
  \ you a small cup of warm dark brew and asks you to take your first sip. It evokes\
  \ emotions, previously unregistered and your amazement grows into something more.\
  \ \"I didn't expect to find love here,\" you thought. Her daughters bring over a\
  \ beautiful old filter system, clean but weathered, and begin to demonstrate the\
  \ process of traditional Vietnamese filter coffee. As it slowly drips down into\
  \ the turquoise china cup, the woman holds out a pan of an inviting creamy substance.\
  \ \"C\xE0 Ph\xEA Tr\u1EE9ng\" she announces, and your spectrum of senses are changed\
  \ forever.\n\nIt's easy to be swept up in the energy of this place, the directions\
  \ of pedestrians and vehicles coexisting and colliding, there's almost a pull to\
  \ follow large bodies of people when the opportunity arises to cross the road. But\
  \ this is how you fell in love with this city, with the food, its people and culture;\
  \ the juxtaposition of old and new that effortlessly intertwine themselves. With\
  \ coffee beans roasted with a passion for flavour and pho made with a passion for\
  \ the process. No, you didn't expect to find love in this city, but it would seem\
  \ you found something more."
