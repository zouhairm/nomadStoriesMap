Text: "Okay, so this is the story about how I got lost in the desert in my PJs. At\
  \ the Mojave Desert River museum (Btw there is no river anymore), I realized that\
  \ some of the prehistoric human artifacts were found on the Mud Mountains which\
  \ happens to be right behind my trailer. So instead of sitting in the trailer to\
  \ enjoy the cockroaches and the silence, I decided to take a walk to the mountains\
  \ after 4 pm (before that the weather is too hot to walk). I take a bottle of water\
  \ and my camera and started walking. Mars (utterly enthusiastic dog at the ranch)\
  \ decided to come with me. Since there were rattlesnakes and other kinds of underground\
  \ animals (rabbits, squirrels, and lizards mostly), the underneath of the ground\
  \ was full of tunnels. Most of the time, dry soil didn't have enough strength to\
  \ carry my weight so if Mars or I happened to step on one of these underground tunnels,\
  \ they tended to collapse immediately. Therefore I started to follow Mars not to\
  \ botter a rattlesnake and get bitten. As I told you, Mars is utterly enthusiastic\
  \ and gets distracted a lot (I might be the same but let's blame Mars since he doesn't\
  \ have an Instagram account) thus the way we followed to the Mud Mountain was full\
  \ of zigzags. Around 6 pm, I finished half of my water (which should have been the\
  \ sign to start going back) and the mountain was still not anywhere near. As I had\
  \ only a quarter of my water left, I felt like it should be to sign to turn back\
  \ home. As I turned I realized that I could no longer see the trailer, the ranch\
  \ nor the abandoned house that I walked past. There was a little valley kind of\
  \ structure between my place and the mountain so I wasn't able to see any kind of\
  \ artifacts. I looked up at the sun. I have a maximum of an hour before the sun\
  \ sets and one and a half hour before the complete darkness. I checked my phone\
  \ I had no signals. Since we have been walking in zigzags, it wouldn't make sense\
  \ to walk exactly the opposite of the mountain because I could have ended up in\
  \ a further place than home and will not make back home before dark. As time passes\
  \ the weather started to become cold so my thin PJs wasn't comfortable. Mars was\
  \ the happiest of two of us because he found and started to eat the skull of a dead\
  \ animal (it seemed like a dog skull and the skull wasn't bleached and has some\
  \ rotted meat on it so I would guess it wasn't older than 3 months or so). Therefore\
  \ I was kinda disgusted by Mars but he was the only creature I could have trust\
  \ around me and well he is a dog anyways. While I was trying to decide which way\
  \ to go, I realized that the old lady at the ranch was mentioning everything according\
  \ to their cardinal directions. I mapped the ranch in my head to understand where\
  \ does the Mud Mountain falls according to cardinal directions. I decided that the\
  \ mountains were at the Southwest of the ranch. I used the sun to locate myself\
  \ and start walking to the Northeast. I tried to walk fast because if the sun goes\
  \ down, I will lose the sense of my location. Eventually, the sunset and I started\
  \ to panic mildly. Then I saw the abandoned house in distance and I was home after\
  \ 20 mins of walk in the twilight. In the end, I had a story to tell and Mars had\
  \ a disgusting skull to eat. \nThe lesson learned: \n1. The things seem closer than\
  \ reality in the desert since there nothing to compare the distance.\n2. Knowing\
  \ the cardinal directions is important if you are in a desert.\n3. Let somebody\
  \ know that you are taking a walk into the desert.\n4. Don't go out in PJs.\n5.\
  \ Take more water.\n6. Last but not least take a dog with you. (I might be disgusted\
  \ by Mars but well I still love him)"
