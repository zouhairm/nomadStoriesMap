Text: "It was almost spring time when i first saw this enchanted city. The old and\
  \ beautiful castle was in the top of the main street, and in the end, the Hollyroad\
  \ Park, an amazing view of the past. The entire city of Edimburgh makes you breath\
  \ history, feel like you\u2019re in some Sherlock homes movie. The people there\
  \ has a strange habit of seat in somebody\u2019s sepulture and eat their lunch!\
  \ So bizarre! The cemeteries are part of the culture, as the gost histories and\
  \ the amazing views you have if you climb some hills (wich can be harder in the\
  \ summer, but always pleasent.) the end will never disappoint you. The Highlands\
  \ are the closest you can be to the serenity, you gonna see nature untouched by\
  \ the cities, and gonna breath the same air that the brave made history fighting\
  \ for a better and independent Scotland. Also, i can\u2019t forget to say something\
  \ about the nightlife in Edimburgh! It\u2019s magical (in such many ways!) if you\u2019\
  re a harry potter fan, you can discover the meaning behind the characters histories\
  \ and names, even the school that gave the idea of Hogwarts. Everything you don\u2019\
  t know (yet) is there, and you can get a tour by walk and with an great guide. The\
  \ other option is enjoy the music there and the bevereges too! If you\u2019re able,\
  \ try the whisky and be amazed by it\u2019s taste. To go further you can even visit\
  \ some whisky factories and have a delightful day ( in many ways \U0001F609). This\
  \ city got my heart, my mind and is my little heaven in this crazy world we have\
  \ here. If you\u2019ve never been to Scotland before, don\u2019t miss it! And book\
  \ you ticket as soon as possible \u2764\uFE0F"
