Text: "The young girl reached for the machete lying on the steaming New York asphalt.\
  \ All five adults crowded around the farmer\u2019s market stall and the kelly green\
  \ canoe gasped and lunged. Her small hand recoiled and her blue eyes turned to me,\
  \ puzzled. We chuckled and I said, \u201Cthe machete is too sharp for a six year\
  \ old, but I have an important job for you with this rope.\u201D\n\nAs we began\
  \ threading the rope through the crude punctures dotting the upper rim of the canoe,\
  \ securing the makeshift birch and twine benches we had fashioned, I thought about\
  \ her instinct to grab the tool and to join in on canoe maintenance. Over the last\
  \ fortnight, I had fought to recover a bit of that impulsivity and go-get-em attitude\
  \ in myself. \n\nTwo weeks earlier, I found myself in a white pine barn on a low\
  \ mountain in Vermont. I was preparing to set off on a two-week journey from Fort\
  \ Edward, New York to Beacon, New York. Ten strangers, paddling five canoes and\
  \ camping in parks, would learn about the Hudson River from the closest seat we\
  \ could find. \n\nUpon arrival, I was introduced to two tall British men and one\
  \ sandy-haired Latvian. Each man held an orange machete with a thin coat of flaking\
  \ rust decorating the blade. Though I had my instructions, I waited for the oldest\
  \ man, a Brit of around 50 years with a pouting lower lip, to gesture toward the\
  \ machete on the earth floor before I picked it up and began to hack at my own pine\
  \ log. He gave his permission, my journey began.\n\nThat log and that machete broke\
  \ through the soft skin of my unworked hands. Blisters formed and muscles knotted\
  \ in my shoulders and forearms as I inexpertly fashioned a paddle with a slim handle\
  \ about two meters long. A gnarled bit of amber pine, which I was not able to hack\
  \ away, became a crook for my hand during the 200 plus miles I would use that oar\
  \ to move water from the bow of my canoe to the stern.\n\nAs I watched the banks\
  \ change from forested perches for American bald eagles near Saratoga National Historical\
  \ Park, to gravel and sand repositories behind cement retaining walls in Troy, and\
  \ to views of the Vanderbilt Mansion balanced atop the bald head of Hyde Park on\
  \ the eastern bank, the crude gashes left unsanded on the plane of the paddle were\
  \ with me; that pine log, that machete, my hands, had taken me there. And I had\
  \ waited for permission from a man I didn\u2019t even know to get started?\n\nAfter\
  \ lashing canoe seats for fifteen minutes or so, my young friend found driftwood\
  \ and cardboard and knew they could be put to use. She asked me to use the small\
  \ blade I carried to cut sails from the cardboard. Wriggling one bit of wood into\
  \ a notch in another, she erected a mast and we tied the cardboard sail to it with\
  \ blue twine. When her ship wouldn\u2019t stand upright, we supported it with more\
  \ wood and twine. Charcoal from our campfire soon materialized, and our ship had\
  \ a paint job!\n\nBy the time the vessel was complete and deemed seaworthy, my cheeks\
  \ were sore from smiling and my partner\u2019s cheeks were smeared with coal, as\
  \ if she had just climbed out of one of the fifty foot high chimney stacks along\
  \ the river, relics of the Hudson\u2019s 19th century ice industry. \n\nNo permission\
  \ had been asked, commands had been given, and a whimsical and authentically unique\
  \ ship had been engineered. My fortnite journey down the Hudson, my revelations\
  \ of agency and learning what my own hands could create and where they could take\
  \ me stood in relief to a six-year-old\u2019s imagination and fearlessness, as yet\
  \ untested - as yet in tact. I left Beacon wondering, \u201Cwhen I had been taught\
  \ to ask permission?\u201D\n\nI may have been taught, but I was able to unlearn.\
  \ A canoe, a paddle, a river, don\u2019t require permission."
