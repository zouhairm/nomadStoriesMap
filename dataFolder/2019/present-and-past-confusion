Text: "I used a train to go thousands of kilometers and thousands of years to see\
  \ where life had begun in Aswan and how everything changed. My journey started at\
  \ the central train station in Cairo where you could different people from different\
  \ backgrounds and cultures are all waiting together for one train to go to their\
  \ destination together. A 15-hour journey with my enthusiasm to see what monuments\
  \ counting their birthdays in thousands have to tell and a surprise that people\
  \ living nearby are not aware of what they have. \nEarly next day, we went out from\
  \ the train visiting the high dam. To be honest, I didn\u2019t hear the information\
  \ I needed to hear on this tour. After that, we went to Philae temple which was\
  \ first in Island of Philae before being moved to the Island of Agilika. The temple\
  \ was built in the Ptolemaic era and used for worshiping goddess Isis. There was\
  \ a belief that the island surrounded by Nile because of her tears over her murdered\
  \ husband Osiris. After finishing the temple tour, I met Nubian people selling African\
  \ souvenirs and explaining their stories and translating few Nubian words into Arabic.\
  \ After some time, we went to El Nabatat Island, where you can enjoy the February\
  \ sun like never before. I had an unforgettable walk among the rare plants with\
  \ the smell of coconut and natural essences sold by locals.  Then heading to the\
  \ Nubian village where you could see the colorful present of Nubia in its houses\
  \ and spices. I had an Egyptian tattoo of Horus eye. I had a Nubian treat of bread,\
  \ black honey and a cup of tea. With the next sunrise, we arrived to the Kom Ombo\
  \ temple which was built to worship Sobek and Horus, they worshipped that crocodile\
  \ to prevent him from hurting their children. Nile is famous for the crocodiles,\
  \ I have seen a few, whilst moving to the Nubian village. I bought a colorful scarf\
  \ and necklace there. There was a Souq with lower prices in both Luxor and Aswan,\
  \ they have a variety of prices and collections. Remember not to lose yourself at\
  \ the shops and forget to have a nice walk by the Nile. The next day, I relaxed\
  \ while sailing through Isna lock to go to Luxor was magnificent. The locals usually\
  \ take small boats to sell their products to ships. \nArriving to Dendra the next\
  \ day, we took a horse carriage to the temple, it was a nice experience. I hoped\
  \ that we could have a chat and get to know more about him. The next day, we went\
  \ to Karnak temple which had decayed monuments from different ages starting from\
  \ the middle age until the Ptolemaic era, hearing how the Egyptians used to place\
  \ Obelisks in place was complicated as rocket science rather beautiful as dancing\
  \ to a song for the Beatles for the first time. The great hypostyle hall with colored\
  \ paintings took my heart from the first look. My mind was blown the moment I knew\
  \ that all these paintings in all the temples used to be colored, but they were\
  \ hidden for years and lost their colors gradually. At night, I went to Louxor temple,\
  \ it has a better look at night because of the lightings over the kings faces. It\
  \ was nice to visit Abu Elhagag mosque built over temple ruins and you can see Pharaonic\
  \ paintings on the walls. I couldn\u2019t say goodbye to that trip without passing\
  \ by the amazing kings and queens lived before in the valley of kings and then Hatshupset\
  \ temple at the Qurna in Louxor where I have passed by locals making souvenirs from\
  \ stones and I saw the whole process my friend even tried to share them in stone\
  \ breaking and I bought a key holder with a nice Heliograph writing on it. I wasn\u2019\
  t ready to return to the present. I said goodbye to my beloved guide Aly and went\
  \ to the station where I took the train and slept the whole road so tired, but so\
  \ happy and grateful for all those memories and sights from the past."
