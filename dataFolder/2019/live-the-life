Text: Born and raised up here, has been mesmerized by its beauty, where the nature
  calls you in its lap, come I take you to India. From the dense forests of Bengal,
  to the white charms of Himalayas; your soul gets completely drowned with the oceans
  of South India, and the culture of West will not let you leave the country. From
  experiencing the tuff mornings of the busy bee Mumbai, or to the soothings evening
  In Mysorie, I think India has to satiate the need of every traveller. The place
  you had want to live your life for, the place you had never want to live, the place
  where you would believe what true love is, the place that makes you feel complete.  Every
  person like any other country wakes up to monotony life, and yet they end it by
  spending evenings either in the cafes or the restaurants. People are lovely here,
  though they seem frustrated from their routine lives however each one is opening
  arms to you and welcome you with great hospitality. Saints have found their aim
  of living by disappearing in the mountains and temples and mosques have adopted
  the humanity. India is unique, in culture, in people, in diversity, in natural beauty,
  in mountains, in oceans, just everywhere, and you have achieved, peace.
