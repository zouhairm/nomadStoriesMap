Text: "Since that evening was my last one in the city, I thought it is a good time\
  \ to explore its night life and gay culture. Cambodia is very tolerant of alternative\
  \ sexuality, and Phnom Penh\u2019s gay scene is intimate and easy to navigate- most\
  \ gay pubs, bars and cruising areas are concentrated within the South-Central district.\n\
  \nI picked the very popular and amusingly named Love Spa for my evening. Located\
  \ at the intersection of Streets 105 and 350, it isn\u2019t difficult to miss except\
  \ for the faded board that announces its existence. The two story building contains\
  \ a spa, steam room and plunge pool on the ground floor, and private cabins and\
  \ a caf\xE9 on the first floor which hosts cabaret shows on Tuesday and Saturday\
  \ evenings.\n\nUnlike Bangkok\u2019s commercialized and overcrowded gay scene, the\
  \ crowd here is almost entirely local\u2014most visitors are young Khmer students\
  \ and professionals\u2014and an Indian man attracts attention. I do not speak Khmer,\
  \ and so had to rely on my very limited knowledge of French to communicate with\
  \ the other patrons.\n\nThe city boasts of a fairly good number of gay-owned businesses.\
  \ One that is popular with tourists is the Blue Chilli Bar, not very far from the\
  \ National Museum. It is a gay and lesbian bar run by a Khmer/Thai couple and they\
  \ have their own drag show on weekends. Witnessing the open gay culture in the capital\
  \ of a comparatively impoverished nation that is still recovering from the traumatic\
  \ period it went through so recently, it is difficult to comprehend what holds back\
  \ gay entrepreneurship in India. Why even a metropolis like Mumbai does not have\
  \ a single dedicated gay pub or restaurant, and why people have to rely either on\
  \ mobile apps or risky rendezvous on local trains to meet other gay men, I will\
  \ not understand."
