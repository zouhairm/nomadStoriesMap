Text: "An impromptu trip led to me preparing to take on Wales\u2019 highest peaks\
  \ in the most unconventional attire: a pair of jeans, shabby sneakers, an olive\
  \ hoodie and a leather jacket. It was early October and the rain was pouring. Hard.\
  \ Murky puddles were vibrating with each drop of rain tumbling towards the ground.\
  \ Led by the iciest of winds tiny transparent sky divers were jumping head first\
  \ into the madness bellow. To its credit, though, the Snowdonia Nation Park would\
  \ be better described as a tame beast rather than an outright madness. It is wilderness\
  \ somewhat packaged up for consumption. It is where the spectacle of unhinged nature\
  \ is combined with the soft shuffle of sheep making their way through the tall yellowish\
  \ grass. And it would have been so much prettier had the clouds not been there.\
  \ \nEven so, Snowdonia\u2019s beauty is quite overwhelming, all 2,140 km2 of it.\
  \ I took in every blade of grass, every rumble of the wind, I tried to memorize\
  \ every scent and feeling\u2026 for about 20 seconds. Then, in true millennial fashion\
  \ I started taking pictures. \u201CMy mom will love these\u201D, I thought to myself\
  \ as I snapped another one. When checking to see whether any of the pictures had\
  \ tuned out decent I noticed something. A girl in a yellow jacket and a maroon beanie\
  \ with a cartoon peach on it was present in all my shots. I got closer to her. We\
  \ didn\u2019t talk but after walking together in silence for a while there was a\
  \ sort of mutual understanding between us. An unspoken thing.  I\u2019d stop to\
  \ take pictures and she slowed her pace so I could catch up. I watched her as she\
  \ made her way up on top of Tolkien-esque paths paved with large boulders, through\
  \ steep valleys carved by centuries of Mother Nature\u2019s elements hard at work.\
  \ Now I made sure to include her in my pictures.\nFinally, after running over the\
  \ line in my head a couple of times I managed to blurt out: \u201CWe sort of match\
  \ with the scenery.\u201D She looked back at me understandably confused. I tried\
  \ to reiterate: \u201CThe colors, I mean. You\u2019ve got the yellow and red, I\u2019\
  ve got the green.\u201D  Suddenly she smiled and the wind must have stopped for\
  \ a second because I couldn\u2019t feel the cold anymore. \n\u201CYou\u2019re right.\u201D\
  \ she said. \u201COne hell of a day we chose for a hike isn\u2019t it?\u201D\nI\
  \ asked if she liked peaches (she did) and if she was a student (she was not). \n\
  \u201CI actually work in accounting.\u201D she half-screamed trying to cover the\
  \ howling of the wind. \u201CI join these kind of trips sometimes to clear my mind.\
  \ Meet new people.\u201D \n\u201CWell today is your lucky d-\u201CI feel over the\
  \ edge of the hill.\nFortunately, the drop wasn\u2019t dramatic. I crawled back\
  \ up in one piece. I kept reassuring her I was fine but Peach-girl insisted we rest\
  \ for a while. The sky had cleared a bit but my wet clothes amplified the crushing\
  \ cold running through my body. A thousand needles were simultaneously pressing\
  \ against my thighs. The hoodie underneath my jacket had tuned a darker shade of\
  \ green, completely soaked. She grabbed one of my hoodie sleeves and twisted it.\
  \ Streams of water started pouring out. We laughed wholeheartedly. \n\u201CI\u2019\
  m so hungry!\u201D she exclaimed.\n\u201CAnd tired.\u201D I chimed in. \u201CMaybe\
  \ we should go back, I think we\u2019ve seen enough.\u201D\nHad we, though? An elder\
  \ lady was swiftly approaching from the opposite direction. Chloe, my Peach-girl,\
  \ shouted: \n\u201CExcuse me! How is it up there? Is it worth going?\u201D The woman\
  \ replied in a raspy voice: \u201COh, it\u2019s really foggy and windy but there\u2019\
  s a gorgeous lake.\u201D Chloe and I looked at each other, teeth clattering.\n\u201C\
  Should we go further?\u201D she asked.\n\u201CI think we have to, yeah.\u201D \n\
  Sunshine was now filtering through the thick clouds. The horizons were clear and\
  \ vividly colored.\n\u201CIt would have been so much prettier had we hiked on this\
  \ type of weather all along.\u201D I sighed. \n\u201CI guess so.\u201D said Chloe.\
  \ \u201CBut we truly earned this sunshine, didn\u2019t we? I think we\u2019re quite\
  \ lucky, you and I.\u201D\nI smiled. \u201CI think so too.\u201D"
