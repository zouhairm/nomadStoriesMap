Text: "The border guard in the front of the minibus moves slowly and methodically\
  \ past muted rows of passengers, eyeing closely each and every document and peering\
  \ from passport to face to passport again. First the elderly babushka next to her\
  \ husband, floral shawl wrapped tight around her head; now the young mother, hushing\
  \ the little bundle cradled in her arms. I keep quietly telling myself that I\u2019\
  m glad to be here but the tension is so thick you can practically cut it with a\
  \ knife.\n\nA pungent mixture of stale sweat and alcohol hangs heavy in the air,\
  \ condensation drips lazily in fat droplets down the inside of the windows. It\u2019\
  s stuffy - someone behind me stifles a cough - but we all must wait our turn. The\
  \ heated proximity of so many human bodies crushed together sits in stark contrast\
  \ to the dusting of frost covering frozen fields that disappear off into the night.\n\
  \nSoon the uniform, green and immaculate, looms large next to me. I hand over my\
  \ documents and smile weakly, but the glare I receive ends my insincerity. An eternity\
  \ passes, another cough; then a decision is made. \u201COff\u201D, he growls in\
  \ deep Russian, signalling towards the door. I mouth a silent protest but I\u2019\
  m instantly cut off; there is no room for debate here, no opportunity for dissent.\
  \ \n\nI guess I shouldn\u2019t have been surprised because I\u2019d been warned\
  \ that something like this might happen. Almost as soon as I\u2019d confessed to\
  \ friends and family of my plans to visit Transnistria \u2013 a self-declared pro-Russian\
  \ breakaway state wedged uncomfortably between Moldova and Ukraine \u2013 I started\
  \ hearing all the warnings: Isn\u2019t it dangerous? What happens if something bad\
  \ happens? You must know the embassy won\u2019t be able to help you, you\u2019ll\
  \ practically be on your own. You\u2019d be stupid to go \u2013 because you just\
  \ don\u2019t know what\u2019s out there. I waved their concerns away, more irritated\
  \ at what I saw as fear of the unfamiliar than their genuine concern for my safety.\n\
  \nBecause it\u2019s true that in many ways Transnistria is anonymous, a blank space\
  \ on a map that I bet most of us in the rest of the world have never even heard\
  \ of, let alone be able to point out. It would be fair to say that it has a bad\
  \ reputation; this thin strip of land lying along the banks of the Dniester River\
  \ owes its existence both to the heavy presence of the Russian army and as a centre\
  \ of dubious economic activity: gambling, arms smuggling, people trafficking and\
  \ the rest. Born out of the agonies of a bitter civil war at the fall of the Soviet\
  \ Union, surrounded by states hostile to its existence and recognised by no other\
  \ independent country, half a million people call this place home. \n\nYet that\u2019\
  s half a million lives; half a million stories. This is the real reason why I want\
  \ to see Transnistria with my own eyes \u2013 not because of some intangible danger\
  \ but to take a leap and witness this hidden world in person, to meet those who\
  \ inhabit the places that the rest of us know so little of. For surely this is one\
  \ of the essences of travel \u2013 to render the abstract real and to not be held\
  \ hostage by our reservations.\n\nBut such lofty ideals will have to wait for now.\
  \ As I\u2019m frogmarched towards an uncertain and potentially uncomfortable interrogation\
  \ in a dingy-looking cabin I can\u2019t help thinking that perhaps, just this once,\
  \ I shouldn\u2019t have made that leap into the unknown."
