Text: My life is a journey of my soul with my soul mates to the cuddling nature. The
  travel which gives you peace of mind and refreshing experience. We always travelled
  to the common places finding hidden gems inside. I would like to share our  blissful
  experience in Meghalaya, India. As you all know that India is the heaven for travellers.
  North-east of India is one of the surprise packages. It's a true mixture of calm
  and wild nature. Breathtaking mountains, waterfalls, blowing wind, scenery, mist,
  clouds, cleanliness makes Meghalaya very special. Apart from common tourists places,
  many other hidden places are available to see locally at few kilometers if you're
  ready to wander! It's going to the blissful destination. Wild nature portrayed by
  huge and scary waterfalls flowing from the back rocks throwing cold water flowing
  down to the calm paddy fields. Driving through thick clouds in dangerous ghats passing
  from one mountain to the other is another Bourne voyage. Eating local food is truly
  delicious. Combing through the markets for window shopping is joyful. In my opinion,
  anywhere you visit, always try to explore local markets with locals. Travel own
  self and get the maximum out of the trip.
