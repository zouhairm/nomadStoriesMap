Text: "Climbing up the narrow stairs from the bathroom window upon the rooftop was\
  \ Joan setting up the grill, he is Joaquim\u2019s father. Three or four kilos of\
  \ cal\xE7ots laying on his left, on the other side numerous packs of sausages, between\
  \ fuets and butifarras. Joan was smiling while he refined the last details of the\
  \ delicacy he was preparing for his family and their Mexican guest. \nIn the kitchen,\
  \ there was Rosa, Joaquim\u2019s mother preparing the aioli. The classical Spanish\
  \ sauce made only from extra virgin olive oil and garlic cloves, only oil and garlic.\
  \ Nothing else. \nA year earlier I came across Joaquim and Anna in a volunteer program\
  \ in Ciudad Juarez, Mexico. That January afternoon they\u2019ve adopted a young\
  \ Mexican man, now I felt like a Fontseca Falgueras, a traditional Catalan family.\
  \ Bakers and owners of Patisseria Falgueras since 1911 in the little coastal town\
  \ of Vilasar de Mar, about 30 kilometres from Barcelona along the Mediterranean\
  \ coast. \nThe butter and sugar aromas reigned their home. Right next to the pastry\
  \ shop was the also family owned cafeteria, Petit Falgueras, where Anna and Quim\
  \ ran the business. The day always started with caf\xE9 con leche accompanied by\
  \ Tosta de tomate with jam\xF3n ib\xE9rico. \n-\tMake sure you give him the good\
  \ kind. Quim told his mother so I could try Spain\u2019s gourmet Crown jewel. Worlds\
  \ apart in flavour and texture from what I\u2019ve tried in Mexico or anywhere else.\n\
  \nRubbing the fat until it dissolved was necessary to really appreciate the quality\
  \ of the Iberian ham, that was the seal of excellence; alongside the acorn smell\
  \ or the dark Brown colour that differentiates it from all the imitations. That\
  \ was only the appeticer, the real feast was cooking in the rooftop of the bakery,\
  \ below the Fontseca\u2019s place. All in the same old building.\nCalcots come from\
  \ the same family as onions, the circumference is smaller but the tail is larger,\
  \ they only harvest on the Winter. Cal\xE7ots de Valls is the official name, EU\
  \ protected geographical indication. The right method to cook them is directly on\
  \ the grill and let them simmer until the inside is soft and the peel comes out\
  \ with ease. Grab them by the tail, dip the cal\xE7ot in a special sauce anyone\
  \ can grab on the nearest supermarket and right into the mouth. Repeat the process\
  \ until you get tired or run out of cal\xE7ots. The symphony cannot be compleated\
  \ without butifarras, a Catalonian bratwurst, beer, wine and cava. \nAnna and Quim\
  \ constantly interrupted the family and reminded them to speak in Spanish, their\
  \ main language is Catalan. Football, political similarities and corruption between\
  \ Spain and Mexico, and Catalonia\u2019s gourmet culture were common topics during\
  \ the meal. No words could have come out of me, my mouth, nose and ears were occupied\
  \ absorbing every tiny detail from the typical Sunday lunch at the Fontseca\u2019\
  s. \nCatalans do not consider themselves to be Spaniards, their cultures have tremendous\
  \ differences considering they share the same geopolitical space. Food and family\
  \ always complement each other in almost every country of the western hemisphere,\
  \ even with different languages being talked on the same table. A great dish Works\
  \ better than the best translator around. \nThe moon could be seen from the distance\
  \ as I left their home towards the airport. My first day of school in Madrid was\
  \ a flight away."
