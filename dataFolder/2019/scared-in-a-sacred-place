Text: "SCARED IN A SACRED SPACE\nIt was six months ago when I was roaming on the streets\
  \ of Delhi with a friend of mine when we came across  Hazrat Nizamuddin Aulia Dargah.\
  \ In the narrow streets full of shops all covered with the sounds of butcher\u2019\
  s knives making delicious kababs bustling with customers, beggars, devotees and\
  \ street vendors on both sides. As I passed through it, I looked around in amazement\
  \ through bright bazaar and met some curious eyes.  My friend asked me not to look\
  \ them in eye. Suddenly a stranger stopped me in way asking to leave my shoes with\
  \ him then another came telling me about different packets of offerings for the\
  \ shrine in different size. I looked around and noticed that my friend was gone.\
  \ I moved forward looking around when I saw my friend waving at me at the end of\
  \ street. He bought me a white handkerchief to cover my head along with chadar (cloth),\
  \ flowers, and incense sticks to offer at the shrine (dargah). Leaving our shoes\
  \ outside, barefooted we walked inside. Passing through those narrow lanes on our\
  \ way to dargah I saw poor kids in ragged clothes begging for food and money. I\
  \ took out a penny and gave to a little boy. The boy surprisingly went running back\
  \ to shopkeeper nearby to deposit his penny. I could not understand and moved forward.\
  \ I saw some people gathered at a place burning incense sticks in different stands\
  \ which then were picked up by an old man who dipped half burned sticks in water\
  \ and as soon as they cooled down collected them in a large white bag. I stood wondering\
  \ to see how they commercialized their religion profiting so well in God\u2019s\
  \ name. I stood there long enough to be noticed by others as stranger to this new\
  \ place. Two Muslim men dressed in white standing outside the shrine came to us\
  \ and took out a register asking us to write our names. I thought it was some tourist\
  \ entry book so I wrote our names but next to it there were three different columns\
  \ asking us to donate. I looked in my friend\u2019s eyes questioningly. Hastily\
  \ he took the pen to write and paid. Then he moved on to enter the holy dargah and\
  \ pointing to the notice just outside dargah  he went inside and  asked me to wait.\
  \ I have had it now and I was red with rage. The notice outside the shrine said\
  \ \u201CWomen are not allowed inside the sacred space.\u201D\n I was pushed by crowd\
  \ to join other women standing all around the dargah trying to look inside from\
  \ the little spaces in beautifully built walls. Curiously I tried to peek in too.\
  \ It was a room crowded by men and all I could see was some men\u2019s hands or\
  \ some men\u2019s head.  I felt excluded. In that one moment I felt generations\
  \ of women\u2019s pain. I wondered if I travelled back in time. I doubted if this\
  \ was the Delhi I know.\nIn next moment I was distracted by large chunks of men\
  \ going inside a hall to say their prayers (Namaj) With their white caps on they\
  \ stood nicely in lanes to read their Namaj. I couldn\u2019t dare to enter wondering\
  \ if I am allowed to enter. Then an elderly man walk towards me and started shouting\
  \ on me for standing near the gate. He said \u201CDo you not know this is not a\
  \ place for women to stand? You have a separate place to pray. Leave immediately.\u201D\
  \ His eyes were red and so were mine. \nBut soon I felt someone\u2019s fingers pressing\
  \ on my arms dragging me behind. My friend whispered \u201CDon\u2019t oppose, it\u2019\
  s not safe\u201D and in great hurry he got me out of that place. As I left that\
  \ place I turned back to see women praying endlessly and I hoped they were praying\
  \ for freedom from this place because I have never felt so scared in a sacred space."
