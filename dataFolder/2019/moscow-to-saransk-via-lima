Text: "I looked at the departures screen and saw that train 3704, the last train from\
  \ Moscow to Saransk, had already left.\n\nI couldn\u2019t understand how at first.\
  \ Eventually I came to heartbreaking realization that my phone had been set to the\
  \ wrong time since I had stepped in Russia, only hours before. In one of those inexplicable\
  \ twist of fate, my phone\u2019s clock, seemingly confused by the country\u2019\
  s 11 different time zones, had capriciously reprogrammed itself to the wrong time.\
  \ \n\nIt was sabotage by phone.\n\nThe train I was supposed to board was leaving\
  \ without me, taking with it all the hopes of me watching my country\u2019s national\
  \ team play its first World Cup match in over 30 years \u2013 the sole purpose of\
  \ my trip. I had been in Russia for just a few hours and already the months of planning\
  \ and research had been undone by my carelessness and the faulty electronics of\
  \ my phone. Betrayed by my phone, I had to find a way of getting to the city of\
  \ Saransk, some 400 miles East of Moscow.\n\nDesperate, I pleaded with any of the\
  \ attendants at the train station who were willing to hear me out. Their limited\
  \ English and my non-existent Russian made it near impossible to reach any type\
  \ of meaningful understanding. As the minutes passed, and as my anguish grew, I\
  \ began to see more and more white jerseys with the characteristic red stripes across\
  \ the chest \u2013 Peruvian fans, who, guessing by their faces, were in the same\
  \ dire situation as myself. \nI was no longer alone. I approached the group of strangers\
  \ hoping one of them had conceived some sort of master plan that would get us all\
  \ to Saransk in time. They were sharing stories about how they managed to get themselves\
  \ stranded in Moscow.\n\u201CI also missed the train\u201D one said.\n\u201CWe were\
  \ scammed by a phony travel agency\u201D said a father and son duo who had made\
  \ their way from Peru for the occasion.\n \u201CI just got to Moscow and figured\
  \ it would be easy to find a train\u201D said a guy in his early 20s.\nScared of\
  \ being ridiculed, when the turn came to share my story, I told them my flight had\
  \ been delayed making it impossible to make it to the connecting train.\nThere were\
  \ eight of us in total. It was decided that the best and cheapest way to get to\
  \ Saransk was to hail a cab and haggle until we could reach an agreement on price\
  \ and destination. With the help of one of the attendants, we managed to lure a\
  \ taxi driver willing to make the 9-hour drive with no questions asked. \nIt was\
  \ 2 AM by the time we set out on the 9-hour trip. We were all tired, hungry and\
  \ jet lagged. Despite this our spirits were high - someone had pulled out a bottle\
  \ of vodka. As the bottle made its way around the car, we talked about how excited\
  \ we were about the next day\u2019s match; about how long we had waited for this\
  \ game. \nWe shared stories about where we had grown up back in Peru and where we\
  \ lived now. We found out that most of us no longer lived in Peru. All of us agreed\
  \ on how much we missed the food back home. It was easy to talk to these strangers,\
  \ it felt like being back home and talking to my old friends. During the ride, we\
  \ bonded over our shared experiences and memories of home.\n\nWe made plans to meet\
  \ after the game and celebrate, regardless of the game\u2019s outcome. \nPeru ended\
  \ up losing the game but what a game it was."
