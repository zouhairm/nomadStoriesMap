Text: "\u201CIf you wish to enter, follow me and don\u2019t speak English. Don\u2019\
  t act conspicuous.\u201D\n\nWe are right in the middle of Tokyo\u2019s crowded Shinjuku\
  \ neighbourhood, with bright neon lights and many people swarming about but the\
  \ atmosphere makes me feel as if we are about to be kidnapped. Still, there is no\
  \ choice but to follow the guy, it seems he is our only hope if we want to experience\
  \ the exclusive host clubs in Tokyo. My friend and I have been trying to get in\
  \ from club to club for almost an hour with no luck.\n\nIn contrast to the usual\
  \ nightlife, to enter the host clubs in Japan, one must be scouted and invited in\
  \ rather than just walking up to the door of a chosen establishment and paying.\
  \ And despite us being two females looking quite homogenous to the locals, conversing\
  \ in English acts as a deterrent for any undercover scouts in the crowd. Even when\
  \ we knock on the door of these clubs and make it to as far as the reception desk,\
  \ one reason or another is given and we are refused entry.\n\nIn the end, it was\
  \ sheer luck that we ran into a female that just left a club in the elevator. She\
  \ was in tears and I asked if she was okay. After she finds out about our situation,\
  \ she wanted to help us out, connecting us with the guy we were following.\n\n---\n\
  \n\u201CWhat type of guy do you like? Cool? Cute? Mature? Charming?\u201D the host\
  \ asks as we sit in a club about half an hour later, bringing in a huge album of\
  \ boys along with their nicknames and characteristics. \u201CMay I pour you a drink?\u201D\
  \ another one asks, patiently waiting. Despite the low lit atmosphere, it\u2019\
  s a bit of a hit to my conscience to be ordering people off a menu so I just told\
  \ them I am open. All of them look decent and in suits anyways.\n\nFirst time at\
  \ a host club apparently warrants a roster of hosts to come in rotation, and at\
  \ the end of the night, the patron can choose their designated host who will be\
  \ their sole entertainer in the subsequent visits. \n\nHost club experience, in\
  \ its essence, is the \u201Cboyfriend experience\u201D where females come in to\
  \ talk to someone who listens without judgement, texts regularly and remembers important\
  \ dates and details. In return, you pay a steep price for each visit and buy expensive\
  \ drinks which will be counted as your designated host\u2019s sales, and the hosts\
  \ are ranked monthly. Apparently the ranking matters a lot because those at the\
  \ end of the list have extra duties that no one wants to do like serving the other\
  \ hosts and even cleaning the toilets.\n\nBased on how clear-cut they categorize\
  \ the hosts according to their personalities, I was expecting them to be acting\
  \ out a role, pretentious and corny but the genuinity takes me by surprise. \n\n\
  \u201CNineteen?\u201D I gasp upon hearing Kaito\u2019s age despite me also being\
  \ in my early twenties. \u201CHow about school?\u201D I ask worriedly before being\
  \ able to stop myself. He doesn\u2019t miss a beat, smiling and telling me that\
  \ he goes to school and this is a part time job for him, even though it is tiring.\n\
  \nI ended up listing him as my designated host when I left just so his rankings\
  \ would go up. I first noticed him when an older host was ordering him around after\
  \ all. Maybe this is how the regular patrons get sucked in, spending money, wanting\
  \ to support their boys.\n\nI didn\u2019t expect at all for Kaito to keep in touch\
  \ but he religiously texted me long after I left Japan. He promises to work hard,\
  \ both for school and hosting, a very Japanese train of thought that you must work\
  \ hard in everything you do.\n\nI truly didn\u2019t know what to expect apart from\
  \ trying not to be human trafficked in Kabukicho district but the humility I felt\
  \ from meeting Kaito is very unexpected. I hope he really does work hard, and one\
  \ day be able to make use of the people skills he gained from hosting in something\
  \ he wants more."
