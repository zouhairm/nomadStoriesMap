Text: "Having visited a country I hold dear to me. Not only have I experienced the\
  \ joys of waking up to a friendly & safe neighborhood, I have also gained personal\
  \ insight to their day to day life. China is known for its rich culture, authentic\
  \ food and fabulous tourist destinations. But what makes China different? Not only\
  \ is the cost of living affordable, their means of transportation is super convenient.\
  \ From renting a bike, to catching a cab/bus, to simply traveling by subway. Being\
  \ a South African in Beijing with the major language barrier, I had no difficulty\
  \ in touring this beautiful city, all I had to do was download an app and I was\
  \ set! Not only is the transportation convenient, but also making payment is, yes,\
  \ you guessed it... Super convenient! WeChat is China\u2019s most popular app. This\
  \ is ideal for people who tend to misplace their wallets. The only downside to this\
  \ beautiful city is the smog! Not only were the temperatures ridiculously low, the\
  \ air pollution was ridiculously high. But don\u2019t let that discourage you, the\
  \ winter will be over soon and hopefully the smog reduces, China is a beautiful,\
  \ convenient, people friendly country. Definitely a country to add to your bucket\
  \ list!\n#china #beijing"
