  \ already and I\u2019ll be there soon!\u201D \n\u201CYou sure? Okay so you just\
  \ need to get off at Colma, I\u2019ll pick you up from there.\u201D\n\u201CPositive!\
  \ Alright thank you! See you!\u201D I hung up the phone after saying goodbye.\n\
  Okay so, from the map itself I have to take the red line in order to reach Colma.\
  \ Which is no big deal, I mean, I just have to get on the right train... or else\
  \ I\u2019ll be riding the one to Fremont.\nI hurriedly ran down the stairs and found\
  \ myself in a platform between two rail tracks.\nSo, which one?\n\u201CHi, I\u2019\
  m sorry, but can you please lend me $2 so I can go home? I don\u2019t have any more\
  \ money.\u201D A girl in a tan coat came up to me suddenly when I was studying the\
  \ map again.\n\u201CUh? $2?\u201D I said hesitantly.\n\u201CYes, only $2, please?\u201D\
  \n\u201CWell\u2014\u201C I looked around and my eyes met a guy who shook his head\
  \ slowly to me, as if he\u2019s indicating that I shouldn\u2019t give this lady\
  \ anything, \u201CI\u2019m sorry, I don\u2019t have any changes.\u201D\n\u201CToo\
  \ bad.\u201D She rolled her eyes and walked away from me, only to approach another\
  \ person.\nWhat is her problem?\nThe guy who caught my gaze earlier came up to me\
  \ and smiled. \u201CYou did the right thing, don\u2019t give her anything, she does\
  \ that to everyone here. I\u2019m guessing you\u2019re not a local?\u201D\n\u201C\
  Nope, I\u2019m just here for the summer. I\u2019m attending summer course at UC\
  \ Berkeley.\u201D I smiled back to him. \u201CThis is my first time taking the BART.\u201D\
  \n\u201COh that\u2019s nice. Where are you going?\u201D\n\u201CI\u2019m visiting\
  \ my aunt in Daly City? But she told me to get off at Colma.\u201D I showed him\
  \ the map from my phone. \u201CSo I need to take the red line?\u201D\n\u201CYeah,\
  \ it\u2019s this way.\u201D He motioned the left side of the platform to me where\
  \ a train came to a stop few moments afterwards.\n\u201CWell, thank you very much!\u201D\
  \ I let out my nicest smile to him and shook his hand. \u201CMy name is Rianti.\u201D\
  \n\u201CElliott.\u201D He beamed back and followed me to the train in my surprise.\
  \ \u201CI\u2019m taking the train too.\u201D\n\u201COh, I see. Where are you going?\u201D\
  \n\u201CHome?\u201D He smiled again. His smile was infectious, he made me want to\
  \ smile all the time too. \u201CSo, summer course eh?\u201D\n\u201CYes. It\u2019\
  s just for a month.\u201D\n\u201CWhere are you from?\u201D\n\u201CIndonesia.\u201D\
  \n\u201CSo you\u2019re not American?\u201D His eyes twinkled at the information.\
  \ \u201CThat\u2019s interesting, I thought you were American. You came here alone?\u201D\
  \n\u201CYep, I came here on my own. Can you believe this is my first international\
  \ trip and I flew like, thousands of miles alone?\u201D \n\u201COkay you got me\
  \ girl, tell me more about it.\u201D He leaned towards me in fascination and I responded\
  \ back in excitement.\nElliott and I talked about a lot of things ranging from my\
  \ summer course, his job at Chicago to US politics in the span of about 30 minutes\
  \ of our trip.\nBy the time we reached Colma, it was almost dark already and the\
  \ fog already rolled in.\n\u201CBe sure to put on your coat, it\u2019s going to\
  \ be very cold.\u201D Elliott gently tapped my shoulder and got out the train with\
  \ me.\n\u201CSo you live around here too?\u201D I asked him while I\u2019m putting\
  \ on my coat. \n\u201CUh, no. I live in Walnut Creek.\u201D He smiled beguilingly.\
  \ \u201CI should\u2019ve got off in MacArthur back then and took the yellow line\
  \ but I want to make sure you\u2019re home safe.\u201D\nI was taken aback by the\
  \ genuine sincerity of his tone and smiled, \u201CThank you very much Elliott.\u201D\
  \n\u201CYou\u2019re welcome. I had an interesting time, can I take you out sometime?\u201D\
  \nI couldn\u2019t hide my excitement when he said that and before I knew it, we\u2019\
  ve exchanged phone numbers.\n \u201CSee you later Rianti.\u201D He nodded to me\
  \ as he got on his train. \n\u201CSee you soon, Elliott.\u201D I managed to catch\
  \ a last glimpse of his smile before the train door closed.\n\nWell, that was unexpected.\n\
  I smiled to myself contently."
