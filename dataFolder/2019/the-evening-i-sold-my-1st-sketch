Text: "Unexpected, unplanned, like almost every other trip of mine. I ended up in\
  \ Udaipur for the 2nd time after a long trip covering most of Rajasthan! I decided\
  \ not to venture, but instead just spend my time by the ghats. It was around 6-7pm\
  \ and the lights glittered on the banks across the ambrai ghat. It was a peaceful\
  \ dawn. \nJust as I was warming up in my poncho against a wall on the ghat, a small\
  \ boy came and sat next to me and started emptying his small carry bag full of sketches.\
  \ They were exactly how a kid would draw, mountains, small houses, disproportionate,\
  \ yet nice and colourful to  look at! He asked me to unplug my earphones and quoted\
  \ the price of each sketch. I was mildly amused! I let him keep talking and took\
  \ pleasure in seeing his entrepreneurial skills. When he was done, I showed him\
  \ all that I had in my wallet, a 100Rs. note. I wanted to help him and offered him\
  \ the 100Rs. note in return for a sketch. He refused! I was taken aback! His concern\
  \ shifted from selling his sketches to my insufficient funds. I convinced him  otherwise\
  \ by saying that I had my friends who would lend me some money for the night. He\
  \ still wasn't convinced. It struck me then, I took out my sketchbook and tore a\
  \ page out of it which had a sketch that I had made in Jaipur. I asked him to go\
  \ sell it for an amount that he felt, would do justice to it. His eyes shone! He\
  \ liked the idea and struck a deal to share half the price of the sketch with me.\
  \ I again tried convincing him to keep all the money but to no avail. \nHe took\
  \ the sketch and strode confidently into the bustling crowd at the ghat. \nFast\
  \ forward 10 minutes and he was back with 80Rs. It was a moment of sheer joy! My\
  \ sketch had been sold! I am not a budding artist or looking to set up a gallery\
  \ in my future and this wasn't about the money! The way the evening had unfurled\
  \ rendered me speechless. The maturity in this 11 year old kid, his attitude towards\
  \ life despite his poverty, all of this shook me and left me with pure happiness.\
  \ All I wanted to do was to talk to him the whole night. We did so! We spoke and\
  \ spoke and spoke. He advised me, told me about his parents, took deep interest\
  \ in my whereabouts. We were totally disconnected from the world and immersed ourselves\
  \ in each other as though we were long lost close acquaintances. \nIt was time to\
  \ leave, I had to have dinner and board my bus to get back home. He grabbed my luggage\
  \ and offered to carry it. He ran forward and got chocolates for me and my friends.\
  \ My friends had arrived by then and were deeply moved by him. We took him for dinner\
  \ and filled our hearts with the joy and glitter in his eyes. \n\nAs unexpectedly\
  \ as he arrived that evening, we saw him fade away slowly in the mob. He was Hitesh,\
  \ the 11 year old boy whom I might never again meet but will never ever forget."
