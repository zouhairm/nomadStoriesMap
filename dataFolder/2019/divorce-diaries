Text: "It was my last hope to escape into the world of me alone.World was known to\
  \ be crooked and game of twisting law to ones advantage.Then I found out the world\
  \ is not too small.It is not what it seemed to be.A trip to Thailand was a game\
  \ changer.The tastes of food we're different.The looks of people were different.\
  \ The energy that people share are spellbound. Beaches and shore seemed to meet.\
  \ Adventurous paragliding and snorkeling gave me a realization that there is beauty\
  \ in unknown. I knew I could fly if I wanted to and go even deep oceans if I wanted\
  \ to.It was just the matter of self confidence even in the game of life.I wanted\
  \ to live in a world of clarity,but now nothing is much more clearer than solitude.The\
  \ cruise ships gave an idea to let loose and get to know new people.And,I found\
  \ there everyone is in search of mental satisfaction.All the merrymaking around\
  \ was a bit annoying in the beginning but it help me break the ceiling.As a girl\
  \ I was always scared to Meet new people.People always tend to learn things in the\
  \ hard way.I felt I should have traveled more before I got married.\nThe begginings\
  \ we're always boring and I now come to the fun part.I met chandramukhi. She was\
  \ a travel guide and seems that she made up that name because she came to know I\
  \ am an Indian.A very enthusiastic person with a smile. \nLanguage was a problem\
  \ for most of the people there and they felt shy on seeing a foreigner.The busy\
  \ people trying to make up for the whole day was speeding through the streets.The\
  \ alcazar show was a dance show of diverse nation's.The woman dancing were extraordinarily\
  \ beautifull.I came out if the show and took pictures with them.Then a person from\
  \ the crew told that they are not woman,they are men and they looked like goddesses.I\
  \ was astound on hearing it and thought \" no wonder why they are eight foot tall\"\
  . My head was near their hips but I gazed at their beauty.  \n\nLife was cruel with\
  \ me,but I found my way out of it through this travel.I would love to explore more\
  \ because I came to know travelling is the best way to learn life."
