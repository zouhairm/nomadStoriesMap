Text: "Since I can remember my dream is to visit as many countries as my money can\
  \ afford and well my money can only afford a coka diet. After few small jobs I made\
  \ my passport without any plan, was more about having the possibility of being ready\
  \ to any opportunity.  They came. I went to Italy, France and Belgium as a backpacker.\
  \ Then Turkey to a summer camp. Then Romania for my Erasmus. I never had a lot of\
  \ money, but I was there when the scholarship came.\n\nBeing in Romania as a International\
  \ Relations student and Harry Potter fan was something unique.  The country has\
  \ so much to see and do, the people are just incredible and I had the best time\
  \ of my life there with my best friends: Serena from Italy, Judith and Mara from\
  \ Germany. Together we were impossible, really. I have many good memories of us\
  \ together travelling around inside of Ursula, our white Dacia Logan, also some\
  \ bruises and broken eyeglass, but well, they are part of my experience. We were\
  \ always up to any trip and from nowhere we decided that we had to go to Chi\u0219\
  in\u0103u and Tiraspol, in Moldova. \n\nAs we were living in Bucharest, we took\
  \ a 9 hours train to Iasi, the city in the border with Moldova to then get a minivan\
  \ until Tiraspol. In the border the office started to complain saying \"You are\
  \ brazilian, you need a visa to Moldova, I won't let you pass.\" and I was saying\
  \ to him the we no longer need any visa to Moldova, but well, took a while, but\
  \ I made it.  From Chi\u0219in\u0103u to Tiraspol was just fine, in the border we\
  \ had to leave the minivan and cross the immigration again.\n\nTo the ones who are\
  \ not familiar with the area: Tiraspol is the second most famous city in Moldova\
  \ for something really important, they are the capital of Transnistria, a not recognized\
  \ country that has its own currency, politicians, passport and speak ucranian and\
  \ russian as first language, not romanian, as expected. The area is just... complicated.\
  \ They don't think that they are moldovians, but russians even if they have Ukraine\
  \ in the way and since they don't really exist, is a problem to be there if get\
  \ in trouble (please, don't take photo of the military force there you can get in\
  \ trouble with KGB).  In the immigration you don't get a stamp, but a paper, which\
  \ is pretty much a souvenir. Before we got there a lot of friends told us: be quiet,\
  \ don't talk too much and try to get a lot of attention, is dangerous. Well, I'm\
  \ a black brazilian, is hard to make people don't look at me in a country where\
  \ they don't have a black person living there. But I decided to try my best. \n\n\
  I was the last one in the immigration room and a friend was waiting for me. I game\
  \ my passport to the officer and kept waiting for my paper. He asked few stuffs\
  \ about my stay, why I wanted to visit and what is the brazilian opinion about Russia.\
  \ I wasn't expecting that, but I answered. Then he started to call everyone in the\
  \ office to see my passport and they were trying to guess how to pronounce my name\
  \ and making fun of everything, at this point I was afraid that I couldn't pass\
  \ and curious: \" Why my passport was the only one that they did that?\"\n\nIn the\
  \ end the officer game me back my passport, saying: \"Isn't common to get brazilians\
  \ here, we really like soccer, do you know Pel\xE9? Also do you have any brazilian\
  \ coin? Is for my collection.\" That was unexpected. I was expecting someone serious,\
  \ no smile, no fun and in the end all the steryotype that we heard went down. I\
  \ got gifts, socks, discounts and free moldovian wine.\n\nThis is a reminder: having\
  \ brazilian coins with me became a sign of friendly behaviour, maybe someone that\
  \ is expected to be rude is just waiting for a sign like this.\n\nI'm Camila and\
  \ this was my story."
