Text: "I lived my whole like in poverty with aid being my daily food. I was supported\
  \ by SOS from childhood that I almost forgot what poverty felt like. I had about\
  \ 3 meals a day, an education, medication and several other things. I am sure you\
  \ have already made up your mind that this is not the definition of poverty. Well\
  \ to me, I was poor. My definition of poverty was further polished in the holiday\
  \ I had while doing my research in Kenya. My friends and I decided to venture and\
  \ struggle to fundraise 5000 dollars to fly us to Kenya and fulfill our life destiny.\
  \ \n\nKenya is a developing country whose development has rocketed since the early\
  \ 2000s. It has however got the biggest slum, Kibera in the whole world, that is\
  \ located in the center of Nairobi, Kenya's capital. Kibera is the biggest slum\
  \ in Africa and the world but it is a place with the happiest, warm hearted and\
  \ kindest people I have met. It was a shocking but also nice to stay in an environment\
  \ knowing that people around you will not treat you like a stranger. In Uganda,\
  \ slums are just the worst place you could ever live. It is better to live in a\
  \ Ghetto than a slum. Neighbors in a slum always enemies, ready to gossip and challenge\
  \ each other whenever possible. This is not the case in Kenya.\n\nWhile I was doing\
  \ my tour in Kibera with a lady named Nasiku Lebala, I was offered a full night\
  \ experience in a shack and was offered a day today experience in Kibera. I loved\
  \ this experience as it was non among others. I have been to developed countries\
  \ such ad Dubai and Canada and realized individuals in these developed countries\
  \ have more stress and are rarely as happy as compared to poor people. It is however\
  \ expected that poor people should be sad and quiet as compared to rich people.\
  \ This surprised me and left me amazed. I had a totally different perspective of\
  \ Kibera when I was in Kenya."
