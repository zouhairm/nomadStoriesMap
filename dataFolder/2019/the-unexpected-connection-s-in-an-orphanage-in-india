Text: "Disembarking the elegant MV World Odyssey, our floating university with over\
  \ 600 students, I experienced how much I lost contact with kids. It was a small\
  \ orphanage in a rural part of India which exposed me in a dusty backyard to over\
  \ 40 playing kids. \n\nWe, and by this I mean our 20 students big group from all\
  \ over the world arrived with a rusty metal bus shortly after lunchtime at the orphanage.\
  \ The air was humid and hot in the burning Indian sun shining intensely from above.\
  \ Rajit a tall Indian guy dressed in a white shirt with brown pants gave us a warm\
  \ welcome and showed us our accommodation for the next three days. He generously\
  \ presented us his barely furnished principal's office with some old air mattresses\
  \ scrambled together on the PVC covered floor.\n\nAfter unpacking and laying down\
  \ our backpacks, 40 kids welcome us enthusiastically running around and screaming\
  \ in joy in their red school uniforms. The school play-yard is covered with brown\
  \ dust which is swirled up with every step, giving my beforehand white shirt a rather\
  \ earthy touch. All the other students in my group directly begin playing with the\
  \ orphans. Whether it is taking up an old stitched ball to play soccer or taking\
  \ them on their shoulders to run around. I am the only one standing kind of awkwardly\
  \ around not knowing how to interact.\n\nI ask myself: \u2018Where does this barrier\
  \ come from? Will I be a good father at some point if I cannot even play with kids?\u2019\
  \ Hence I try to copy the other students. Fake it until you become it, right? A\
  \ little bit unease I begin engaging with my underdeveloped soccer skills but hardly\
  \ catch a ball. Even little boys run me out. But the movement and interaction let\
  \ me loosen up over time.\n\nOn the second day, it is time to visit the classrooms\
  \ during school-time. Many kids laugh at me as my long legs hardly fitted under\
  \ the small wooden tables. Great! Now I can at least become part of the community.\
  \ As the loud metal bell rings in a high pitched tone it is time to play again (or\
  \ at least this is what the kids think). This time I want to give it a try and mimic\
  \ what I saw yesterday. I hold a little Indian boy in my two arms like an airplane\
  \ and make him feel like superman swinging him from side to side. This approach\
  \ looks apparently to exciting that soon I find myself being pulled forcefully by\
  \ other kids into their adjacent classrooms. Shifting in a cluster of little excited\
  \ monsters from one classroom to the other I do not really know where I should actually\
  \ go.\n\nThe third day I feel much more at ease playing with children. Some even\
  \ come to me after lunch demanding \"airplane airplane airplane\". To bad that it\
  \ is almost time to leave the orphanage. As a last act of community, we sit together\
  \ in their improvised church. This multifunctional red building without windows\
  \ and a stone floor holds enough space for all children and us students for a final\
  \ prayer. We sit close together on small mats which overlap each other and cover\
  \ almost the whole ground. Shortly before the prayer starts two little cute boys\
  \ and a girl come to me demanding in unmistakable body language to sit on my lap.\
  \ This ask I cannot turn down and relax surrounded by all these little energy bundles\
  \ in a moment of silence for the prayer feeling almost like father. After some last\
  \ \"airplanes\" and tears I leave the orphanage a little bit sad but also in deep\
  \ gratitude for this exciting and transformative time with no more fears on how\
  \ to interact."
