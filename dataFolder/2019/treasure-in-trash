Text: "Sitting in the backseat of the four-door sedan we awaited his return.  Mounir,\
  \ a Coptic Christian by birth, returned, jumped in the driver\u2019s seat and handed\
  \ us a water bottle filled with vodka and soda. I was a bit hesitant about having\
  \ an open container of alcohol in the car but with a big smile he assured us it\
  \ was ok. \n\nWe met Mounir by chance. Matthew had to run back to the coffee shop\
  \ we were at earlier in the day to retrieve my cell phone charger.  When he heard\
  \ a familiar language amongst the sea of people speaking Arabic he immediately stopped.\
  \  \u201CHey, are you guys American?\u201D, he asked. Turns out Mounir, a local\
  \ Egyptian, grew up in the states and was hosting his long time childhood friend,\
  \ Brian, from Knoxville, Tennessee. \n\nIt was comforting to have finally met a\
  \ local. Cairo had been a bit overwhelming.  From the cars constant honking, to\
  \ the street vendors fighting for your attention, this city had rightfully earned\
  \ its nickname Cairotic. Later that night we met up with Mounir and Brian at a rooftop\
  \ bar overlooking the Nile. Mounir admitted the city could be a bit rough and was\
  \ happy to show us around.\n \nA couple of nights later we were sipping on vodka\
  \ as we drove out of the dusty city. On the way to our destination we passed a huge\
  \ cemetery known as The City of the Dead. \u201CPeople live in there on top of the\
  \ graves\u201D, Mounir said. I couldn\u2019t believe it! He\u2019d later prove it\
  \ by driving us through to see the families living amongst the tombs. \n\nWe finally\
  \ reached the outskirts of Cairo and  pulled into a slum called Garbage City on\
  \ the hills of Mokattam. Inhabited by Coptic Christians they were amongst the city\u2019\
  s poorest. Mounir explained to us that Garbage City and its residents were an integral\
  \ part of keeping the trash out of Cairo. Every day these families went into the\
  \ city, collected the garbage via pickup trucks and donkeys, and transported it\
  \ back to their homes for separation and recycling.\n\n As we weaved our way through\
  \ the bumpy, small dirt roads of the slum you could see trash piled high everywhere\
  \ even inside the buildings. Occasionally we\u2019d stop and Mounir would roll down\
  \ his window to ask the locals for directions to the church. In those moments reality\
  \ hit as the stench from the garbage outside creeped in. \n\nThe car finally slowed\
  \ to a stop as we approached what seemed to be the entrance of a fortress. A couple\
  \ of men approached the car and asked Mounir for his identification. In Egypt your\
  \ religion is marked on the back of your ID. These men wanted to verify he was a\
  \ Christian and not Muslim before allowing us to enter the church grounds. \n\n\
  After explaining to the guards that the rest of us were American tourists he was\
  \ given the greenlight and we rolled through the gates. Surrounded by high walls,\
  \ absent of garbage and children playing soccer we had entered a different world.\n\
  \nIt turned out the church was closed but  Mounir was determined to show us the\
  \ inside. He disappeared for a while and when he returned he brought Youseff, a\
  \ pastor and guard. Mounir later confessed it took a bit of convincing and a small\
  \ bribe to get Youseff to let us in.\n\n\nOnce he unlocked the gates, we walked\
  \ through and stood in complete awe. Before us stood an open air church. This was\
  \ not your typical place of worship. It was illuminated by the moonlight and open\
  \ to sky above. The story is that a piece of paper blew into the lap of a man that\
  \ had the bible verse, \u201Cand on this rock I will build my church, and the gates\
  \ of hell shall not prevail against it.\u201D  So the dynamite was purchased and\
  \ the mountain was blown up to begin construction of The Cave Church of St. Simon,\
  \ the treasure amongst the trash."
