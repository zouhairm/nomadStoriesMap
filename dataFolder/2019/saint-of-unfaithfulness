Text: "Our footsteps tread on wide pathways of concrete and faux cobblestone, the\
  \ vacant streets brimming with sea wind and the exhilarated silence of this fleeting\
  \ moment. In a couple hours, the Santa Monica Mall that spans three city blocks\
  \ will be flourishing with tourists, vendors, and dreamers trying to make the day\
  \ last an eternity. But we\u2019re here first, walking from the stop on Columbus,\
  \ just up the road from the famed pier.\n \n\tOlya continues the conversation we\
  \ had on the bus, before our minds wandered into the lulling silence of a humming\
  \ engine, vibrating window glass, and exasperated sighs of early-morning commuters.\n\
  \n\t\u201CAmericans are so friendly. They really like to help.\u201D \n\n\t\u201C\
  Hmm, well I\u2019m glad. I think we just try to show the best we can be when we\
  \ meet new people. Though, in a way, it kinda feels like showing off. How are people\
  \ in Russia?\u201D\n\n\t\u201CIn Russia, people are nice but they mind their own\
  \ business. They take time. If I ask someone in Russia for help, they think \u2018\
  why\u2019re you talking to me I don\u2019t know you\u2019.\u201D\n\n\tWe laugh,\
  \ then keep asking each other questions about what it\u2019s like to be Mexican,\
  \ if Russia is scary, the difference between Northern and Southern California, and\
  \ Anastasia. All the while, I\u2019m amazed at how friendly of an American I\u2019\
  ve been, to adventure with this girl I met in an empty LAX lobby just an hour ago.\
  \ \n\n\tI asked her to look after my bag while I went to the restroom to rinse the\
  \ muck of a close-quartered Morrissey concert off my legs. It was when I walked\
  \ back, avoiding the married construction worker who fled back to the lobby seconds\
  \ before me, that I truly appraised her. In the starless LA hour of four, you couldn\u2019\
  t see the dirt still on my shins, yet she had the undeniable quality of stardust:\
  \ glistening, curly auburn strands on fair shoulders, poised gray eyes and pursed,\
  \ pale lips. She nods when I say thanks before telling me in a delicately shy voice\
  \ that she is Olya, \u201Cnot Olga\u201D,  from Moscow. I introduce myself, then\
  \ she asks how far away Santa Monica is. \n\n\t\u201CI wanted to maybe see it before\
  \ I leave California.\u201D\n\nMy hand slumped into my shorts. \u201CLet\u2019s\
  \ see, I\u2019m pretty sure it\u2019s close,\u201D I say, thinking back to a faraway\
  \ day filled with kites on the beach.\n\n\tShe stares down while my thumbs volley\
  \ over the phone screen, their nails briefly glowing with each tap. My eyes trace\
  \ the coast line corralled by the soft, blue light of the Pacific. A bus stop right\
  \ outside the airport, a thirty-minute ride, and a bus coming in twenty. \n\n\t\u201C\
  Could you maybe\u2026 come with me?\u201D I\u2019m taken aback, considering the\
  \ flights we both have to catch. A moment later a woman comes round the hallway,\
  \ the construction worker rises to meet her, embracing each others\u2019 hands and\
  \ sharing a kiss before disappearing through glass doors. I look back to her.\n\n\
  \n\tA couple of blocks away now, I see the grassy bluff overlooking the waves we\
  \ hear hushing Santa Monica Beach. The sun hasn\u2019t truly risen, yet its permeating\
  \ light surrounds us, leaving no room for shadows. The pier is a hazy silhouette\
  \ against the indistinguishable horizon sharing a blue softer than a blanket, but\
  \ the Ferris wheel tells us we\u2019re here, and Olya smiles.\n\n\tWe stride together\
  \ to the boardwalk, telling her about the incarnations of myself that have shared\
  \ this place before now. Yet this is the first time something new is happening for\
  \ both of us, the Californian boy and Russian sojourner, a sunrise here. From a\
  \ bench, we see it peak from the east behind the rides and lampposts in a vivid,\
  \ magical slush of watercolors while the western horizon separates into violet and\
  \ indigo. We fall silent then look to each other, and again feel like I\u2019m seeing\
  \ her for the first time. Daylight gave her fresh color, revealing a gentle tan\
  \ that made the edges of her smile even sharper. Sitting so close, I see something\
  \ familiar lingering on her lips, a greater yearning, and I realize I\u2019m not\
  \ the best I could\u2019ve been."
