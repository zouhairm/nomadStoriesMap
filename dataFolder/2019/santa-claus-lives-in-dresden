Text: I was in a press trip in Germany, that passed by the cities of Berlim, Hamburg,
  Frankfurt and Dresden. This last one, had been part of Oriental Germany, before
  the fall of Berlim's wall. To go there, our group took a train that made a stop
  in leipzeg, also ex-communist part of the country. In this stop,that would be of
  20 minutes,  I left the station to see the city. Backing to the platforms, I got
  hipnotized by a girl's accessories shop. I don't remember the time I passed there,
  by when I paied I heard the announcement of my train going. I ran, and I ran, but
  it was useless. I left the train and the whole group, that took my luggage with
  them. In a place where nobody speaks English. I tried hardly. Well, a nice old gentleman
  saw my despair and said he was also going to Dresden. 5 minutes. In the other side
  of the huge station. We crossed the plataforms running. The old sir, with all white
  hair, bear and mustache surprised me running well. We took the right train in time.
  There, he told me he was math teacher in Dresden University and told me curiosities
  about the time when Germany were two different countries. In Dresden, his city,
  he took his old, stylish and well cared car and delivered me in kempinsky hotel,
  where all my colleagues were amazed by my adventure.
