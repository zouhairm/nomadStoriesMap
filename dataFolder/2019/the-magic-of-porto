Text: "What does it spring to mind when you line up long black wizarding robes, neo-gothic\
  \ spiral staircases and sinister stories about Salazar? I bet you associate all\
  \ these with the Harry Potter fantasy novels about a young wizard and his friends\
  \ in Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. However, the magic is real and\
  \ it exists in Porto, Portugal. While living and teaching in Porto, the author of\
  \ the bestsellers J.K. Rowling got inspired by the student uniform capa e batina,\
  \ the top-rated old Lello bookstore and Portugal\u2019s notorious dictator. Even\
  \ though you may not be familiar with the Harry Potter franchise, you would be astonished\
  \ by the miracles Porto has to offer. \n\nIn October 2018 I jumped on a plane with\
  \ a backpack to explore pretty Porto. To get a better taste of the city, I did not\
  \ book a hotel, but instead I stayed with a resident whom I acquainted on couchsurfing.\
  \ Couchsurfying is a hospitality and social network platform for travelers who stay\
  \ with hosts for free and live the city through the eyes of locals. My host was\
  \ a project manager of the Port of Porto and a former gymnast who had Turkish and\
  \ American roots. We started out our tour from an autumn festival in a beautiful\
  \ park in Matosinhos. We walked the cobbled streets of the city, did calisthenics\
  \ on the beach and ate out at family run restaurants called tasca. I am truly grateful\
  \ I befriended someone who was very genuine and trustworthy. The mere fact that\
  \ he opened his home for me and gave we numerous tips about the city was amazing.\n\
  \nFollowing my host\u2019s advice, I joined a free walking tour, which started in\
  \ front of the majestic white building of Porto City Hall. Guided by Gisel, an enthusiastic\
  \ young actress born in Porto, I was fully immersed into the history and urbanity.\
  \ I learned about the fight between absolutism and liberalism, colonial past, the\
  \ Carnation Revolution, decriminalization of drug use, the mayor Rui Moreira\u2019\
  s policies for the revival of the city and the rebellious spirit of tripeiros (Porto\u2019\
  s locals). However, the most important advice Gisel gave to the group was to not\
  \ mess with elderly ladies from downtown because they can make one\u2019s life very\
  \ miserable. \n\nMy fl\xE2neuring ended up on the bank of the Douro river where\
  \ renowned wineries welcomed wine tasters. How could I have missed not trying one\
  \ of Portugal\u2019s famous port wines. I was sitting at a table facing downtown.\
  \ Every sip of the chilled ruby-red tawny wine offered an explosion of fruity and\
  \ refreshing taste. The sunlight was reflecting in the tiles (aka azulejos in Portugal)\
  \ of the houses along the river. What a truly magical experience! I am looking forward\
  \ to coming back and diving again into Portugal\u2019s wonders."
