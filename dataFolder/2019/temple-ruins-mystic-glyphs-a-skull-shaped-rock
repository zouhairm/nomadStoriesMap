Text: "If there is a place in India that mesmerises and baffles at the same time,\
  \ it is the mystical land of Wayanad. For there is something about this densely\
  \ forested hill district of Kerala that has something for every kind of traveller.\
  \ \nMy fascination with Wayanad goes back a long way but it wasn\u2019t until late\
  \ 2017 that I finally got a chance to explore a locale replete with forests, waterfalls,\
  \ trekking routes and truly ancient, historic trails. \nWayanad is amongst the top\
  \ listed places to visit in Kerala with a plethora of tour companies and operators\
  \ offering to take you anywhere and everywhere, but that was too easy. I wanted\
  \ to explore the place entirely on my own and I set out into the unknown with no\
  \ preconceived notions or ideas.\nLanding in Sulthan Bathery, the first pit stop\
  \ had been a Jain temple ruin site, right in the middle of the town. Opening a window\
  \ into a bygone era, I felt like a time traveller who got transported to the time\
  \ when Wayanad was home to a thriving Jain population. One can still see an exceptional\
  \ example of ancient rock sculpturing tradition here, despite the structure having\
  \ weathered in time. \nAn aspect that works well for travellers and backpackers\
  \ in Wayanad is the friendliness and helping nature of the local population. While\
  \ language can be a barrier, but the people will go out of their way to help you\
  \ with places and commute options. The unknown slowly dissipates into a surreal\
  \ familiarity. \nAfter interacting with the people at a local bus terminus, I next\
  \ set out to a site, which is perhaps the only place where one can see Stone Age\
  \ carvings dating all the way back to the Mesolithic and Neolithic Age in South\
  \ India. \nTo reach Edakkal Caves, you need to trek through coffee plantations for\
  \ about 45 minutes before stumbling upon three different sets of ancient carvings.\
  \ These petroglyphs are believed to be more than 7,000 years old and to this date,\
  \ haven\u2019t been deciphered and continue to baffle both field experts and tourists.\
  \ And also, there\u2019s a naturally formed fissure here that will astound you with\
  \ its near-perfect symmetry. If you\u2019re obsessed with prehistoric sites and\
  \ ancient human carvings, this is IT!\nA place that has numerous waterfalls and\
  \ untouched water bodies, one place that really fascinated me was the Hridaya Saras\
  \ or Heart of Chembra. It is not every day that you come across a heart-shaped lake\
  \ but atop the Chembra Mala, which is the highest mountain peak in Wayanad, you\
  \ would. What makes the experience of arriving at this lake truly enriching is the\
  \ trek along the peak, where clouds pass by and you would find birds chirping to\
  \ their heart\u2019s content. \nOne of the places that I had really wanted to visit\
  \ in Wayanad was the Phantom Rock, a towering assembly of rocks locally known as\
  \ Cheengeri Mala. Resembling a skull, from which it gets its name, the rock formation\
  \ is a bit of an unusual destination, but it offers a rare vantage point to relax\
  \ and reflect on the surreal surrounding landscapes. \nUnless you are an expert\
  \ rock climber, climbing the Phantom Rock was no mean task, as I learnt the hard\
  \ way. But, I happened to find a few local women who chose to chill at the place\
  \ on a random day and helped me through the caves by using tree branches as ropes!\n\
  Choosing to travel solo and that too for the first time, worried me initially but\
  \ Wayanad made that trip not just experiential but also empowering. Winding roads,\
  \ pristine waterfalls, vast tracts of tea and coffee estates are all out there for\
  \ travellers to see but to truly understand what this mystic land of forgotten civilisations\
  \ is all about, you need to set out on your own."
