Text: "Appearances are everything on Amman's Culture Street\n\nBy Alex Ray*\n\nA tiny\
  \ blue and grey Tourist Police kiosk sits at one end of Culture Street, a 350 metre\
  \ strip of low-rise apartment buildings in Shmeisani, an inner suburb of the Jordanian\
  \ capital Amman. The tourists mostly hail from the wealthy Gulf states: Saudi Arabia,\
  \ Qatar, Kuwait and the U.A.E. \n\LWedged between a 24-hour supermarket, a 5-star\
  \ hotel and late-night shisha cafes, the two-man kiosk affords a clear view of the\
  \ entrances to two dimly lit bars, La Gitane and Byblos. \n\nInside, men pay steep\
  \ prices to drink with women who get a commission on alcohol sales. Some are from\
  \ eastern Europe, in Jordan on temporary work permits. Others are refugees from\
  \ war-ravaged Syria, Yemen and Iraq.  Women from other Arab countries such as Lebanon,\
  \ Morocco and Algeria are also in the mix. \n\nThe women mostly do not drink alcohol.\
  \ Each night, they leave the bar with patrons under private arrangements that allow\
  \ management to claim it abides by Jordanian law, which outlaws prostitution.\n\n\
  Street prostitution is also not uncommon but mostly confined to safer daylight hours.\
  \ Refugee women wearing abayas, the head to toe black drapes favoured by society's\
  \ most conservative elements, loiter in small groups. Their faces are sometimes\
  \ covered, only to be revealed to the drivers who pull up to inquire about their\
  \ services. \n\nLate in the afternoon a beaten-up sedan pulls up in Culture St \u2013\
  \ shari\u2019a thaqafa in Arabic. The male driver says goodbye to the heavily made-up,\
  \ pudgy young woman wearing a fluoro pink tank top and leopard print leggings. The\
  \ first of many women to arrive over the next hour, she keeps her eyes on the ground\
  \ as she quickly covers the few metres to La Gitane's discreetly marked doorway.\
  \  \n\nBy 11 pm young touts are stationed outside Byblos and La Gitane to invite\
  \ any foreign-looking men inside for \u201Cmusic, drinks, girls\u201D. Distorted\
  \ Arabic pop music and football commentary pour down the street from open-air shisha\
  \ bars serving portly women and men lounging in Abayas and Dishdashas, smartphones\
  \ in one hand, shisha in the other.\n\n\LShortly after midnight the 24-hour H&H\
  \ supermarket is packed with Jordanian, Saudi, Qatari and Emirati young men begging\
  \ for one last alcohol sale, hours after the liquor section was locked up for the\
  \ night. \L\LAt 3 am drunk young men and women exhausted by dancing stumble from\
  \ a nightclub underneath the Kempinski Hotel. Valets wait to whisk them home to\
  \ upmarket suburbs such as Dabouq, Abdoun and Sweifieh. \n\nAt dawn, a lone woman\
  \ wearing fishnet stockings, a short skirt and leather jacket sits on the wide median\
  \ strip outside Byblos. \u201CDo you want anything? I have to go soon,\u201D she\
  \ says. \u201CWhere are you from?\u201D I ask.  \"Iraq\" she replies.\L\LFrom 8\
  \ am, the street fills with office workers arriving for work. \n\nAround mid-morning,\
  \ wearing shorts and singlet I pass the police kiosk on the 200 metre walk between\
  \ my apartment and the gym.  A blue-uniformed officer calls out to me in Arabic.\
  \ \u201CHey, young man! Why are you undressed?\u201D \u201CWhat do you mean? Shoulders\
  \ are not forbidden,\u201D I reply. \u201CThis is an Arab, Muslim country, I will\
  \ tell you what is forbidden and what is not, show me your ID!\u201D he commands.\
  \ \L\n\nSent packing with a warning to cover my shoulders, I wonder at the apparent\
  \ double standards.  Police ignore thinly-disguised prostitution but will not hesitate\
  \ to enforce the law that forbids kissing in public. \n\n\LIn Jordan, keeping up\
  \ appearances is highly prized and a recipe for contradiction. Internationally,\
  \ Jordan depicts itself as one of the most progressive Arab nations, while domestically\
  \ it maintains a conservative Muslim self-image. Witness the clash between Culture\
  \ Street\u2019s sordid nightlife and traditional family values. Jordan has persistently\
  \ high rates of so-called honour killings \u2013 the murder by male relatives of\
  \ women and girls considered to have brought the family into disrepute. According\
  \ to Human Rights Watch, Jordan registers an estimated 15 to 20 \"honour killings\"\
  \ each year. The rate of \"honour killings\" has jumped by 60% since 2016, according\
  \ to the\_Sisterhood is Global Institute\_in Amman."
