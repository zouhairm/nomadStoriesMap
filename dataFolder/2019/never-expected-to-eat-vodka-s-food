Text: "We were in Cambodia, the place where most people told us to come, visit Angkor\
  \ Wat and move on to another country. But after visiting a fishermen village we\
  \ felt we had much more to discover in this country: the local people and their\
  \ inspiring life stories.\n\nSo we\u2019ve decided to stay around for 3 weeks. Towards\
  \ the end of the tour, we arrived in Kampot - a river side small town, in Southern\
  \ Cambodia. \nOne night we went for dinner without making the usual \u201Cresearch\u201D\
  \ on where to eat. \n\nAmong old French colonial buildings, there was a great variety\
  \ of restaurants offering all types of food. However, the owners of the majority\
  \ weren\u2019t really Cambodians. \nLooking a bit more on the streets, we saw a\
  \ place having an oldish, but authentic look: Lemongrass Bistro. It had a Cambodian\
  \ expression all around. They had a small bar outside, the tables were also outdoors,\
  \ some of them directly on the street itself. We noticed they also \u201Crented\
  \ scooters\u201D. So a place that offered services from food, beverage to transportation\u2026\
  \ We were a bit skeptical about it but since we were starving, we decided to eat\
  \ there. \n\nWe looked on the menu, chose the dinner and then, while waiting, I\
  \ started to look better around. My eyes fell on an old newspaper article, hanging\
  \ on the wall: \u201CConnections with the Killing Fields\u201D. \nSince I knew food\
  \ would take a while until was served, I started to read the article. A Canadian\
  \ tourist wrote a book about a Cambodian nicknamed Vodka and his life after the\
  \ Killing Fields. The newspaper article was explaining how the two of them met and\
  \ how the book was written. \u201CAmazing story\u201D I thought. \u201CDid other\
  \ people notice this article?\u201D \nI lifted my eyes to check, but everyone seemed\
  \ busy with enjoying their food. It was then when I noticed that the walls of the\
  \ Bistro were decorated with handmade paintings. There was also a short announcement:\
  \ \u201CFor SALE: Vodka\u2019s paintings\u201D. Interesting, maybe we would buy\
  \ one at the end of the dinner. \n\nThe food arrived and we enjoyed some delicious,\
  \ traditional Khmer dishes. While talking with my husband about the article I just\
  \ read, I saw a dusty bookshelf and noticed that among the Bistro\u2019s menus there\
  \ was one book, in many copies. I got close to it and noticed that it was exactly\
  \ the same book I just read about, in the article.  On the back of the book, it\
  \ was mentioned that proceeds from the sale of the book will be given to Vodka.\
  \ Didn\u2019t think twice and bought 2 copies. \n\nWhile waiting for the bill, I\
  \ checked the book and read few fragments. It was an impressive story about the\
  \ survival of a Cambodian that passed through civil warfare, land-mines, government\
  \ corruption  and dangerous jobs. He had spent one year of his life living in a\
  \ ground hole, hiding from the soldiers.\n\nI was so surprised by these bits I was\
  \ reading that I wanted to ask the waiter if someone knew Vodka, or why were they\
  \ selling his books, paintings etc. Didn\u2019t get to ask my question because when\
  \ the waiter arrived, he smiled to us with all his face and said: \u201CThank you\
  \ for buying the books. Vodka is actually the cook that prepared your dinner tonight\u201D\
  . I felt goosebumps and I asked if we could meet him.\nHe came from the kitchen,\
  \ touched and happy that we read his story and bought the books. I felt an indescribable\
  \ need to give him a hug. A hug to that brave soul that can be an inspiration for\
  \ all of us. No matter how tragic his life once was, he became a warm, positive\
  \ person, melting your heart with his lively smile.\n\nPeople like him travel with\
  \ you in your memory long after you have left their country. They teach you about\
  \ gratitude, about acceptance and about choices. I met people in the past with sad\
  \ life stories that turned into grumpy, selfish beings because of their sufferings.\
  \ Vodka is the proof that we have the power to decide if we let the past to define\
  \ our future life journey."
