Text: "Chania was overrated and I wasn\u2019t impressed.  It was old but not with\
  \ the character of Athens, and the streets were loud and busy.  Crossing the traffic\
  \ was terrifying and I witnessed two accidents in my first night there.  This wasn\u2019\
  t what I came to Crete for.  Seeking out more of the relaxed island feel, I caught\
  \ a bus for Falasarna Beach.  I packed just my day pack with a book, a bottle of\
  \ water, some sunscreen, one of my credit cards, some snacks for the bus, and a\
  \ little cash.  The rest of my things I locked at the hostel.\nThe bus twisted through\
  \ the city streets and through the many types of neighborhoods.  Near the edges\
  \ of town were newer houses up on cliffs overlooking the ocean that reminded me\
  \ of Malibu and in the inner city was poverty with tattered houses and children\
  \ playing in the streets in worn and ripped clothing.  As we left the city the landscape\
  \ went from mostly sea level to rolling hills and then mountains and passed through\
  \ small towns and the occasional restaurant along the way.\nThe stop for Falasarna\
  \ Beach had two choices: the big beach and the little beach.  I said farewell to\
  \ the family that I had been chatting with as they departed at the first stop to\
  \ Big Beach.  I stayed on as the bus confidently sped down a dirt road that couldn\u2019\
  t have fit two vehicles.  The final stop was the Little Beach.  I was traveling\
  \ alone and thought that a little beach sounded less touristy and more my style.\
  \  The bus dropped me off and departed and as I looked around I realized there was\
  \ no beach in sight. \nInstead, in front of me was a restaurant straight out of\
  \ a storybook.  It had a stone patio area with large trees and an amazing view of\
  \ the sea.  There was a plump older woman outside sweeping who waived hello as I\
  \ followed the path down a gravel driveway, hoping that I was heading to the beach.\
  \  It wasn\u2019t the water that stood out to me first, but the brightness of the\
  \ pink flowers that grew on the bushes on the walk downhill.  It was something that\
  \ I had noticed in Athens as well.  The flowers looked brighter in Greece and the\
  \ fruits taste sweeter.\nAt the bottom of the hill the gravel turned into sand and\
  \ I took my shoes off and walked towards the water. I had to take a deep breath\
  \ and take it all in.  The water really was that blue/green color that you see in\
  \ pictures.  The beach ranged from soft sandy spots to rocky areas and on either\
  \ side it was surrounded by black rocks.  It had everything a girl could want. \
  \ The day was hot and swimming alone in the ocean is awkward so after I put my feet\
  \ in the water and took some pictures I relaxed in a chair with an umbrella and\
  \ read a book.  There was a staff member that came by and collected the 6 euros\
  \ for a day of use of the chair and it was worth every penny.  With the busy city\
  \ far from my mind I relaxed and absorbed my surroundings.  This was Greece!\nAfter\
  \ I couldn\u2019t sit in the chair any longer (I was going to get my money\u2019\
  s worth), I hiked back up the steep hill to the restaurant.  Inside I was able to\
  \ pick from many choices that I was told Maria had prepared for the day.  I chose\
  \ the gemista (stuffed tomatoes) and a stuffed zucchini.  It came with bread as\
  \ a first course and I enjoyed my meal under a tree with the wind blowing my hair\
  \ on the stone patio.  Dessert was simply amazing, smooth and creamy with just a\
  \ hint of chocolate.  In an attempt to find it again I showed the picture all around\
  \ my travels but never found it again.\nThe bus ride back was a sleepy content one\
  \ and that night I packed my things to carry on my adventure in the morning.  Chania\
  \ might not have been the right city for this trip, but Greece was definitely the\
  \ right country."
