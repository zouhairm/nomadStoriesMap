Text: "It was March, 2018 when I moved to this beautiful island, called Palma de Mallorca.\
  \ I arrived from South of France, where I stayed for a while, after living and working\
  \ on Bahamas. I have never been to Mallorca before, but I heard a lot of promising\
  \ things about that island. When I arrived, I felt like I am at home. It\u2019s\
  \ hard to describe with words, but I finally found my lost home that I was looking\
  \ for so many years. Mallorca has a special spirit and beauty that is surrounding\
  \ the island. I had a chance to live there for 8 months, but it felt like a few\
  \ centuries. Spanish is a language that I knew from before and is definitely one\
  \ of my favorite. I understand more then I speak, but living there, helped me to\
  \ improve my language skills. I was really inspired by fresh markets on Sunday around\
  \ the island. I am vegan and that was one of the things I really loved. Fruit and\
  \ veggies smelled differently in a positive way. Taste was delicious and you could\
  \ feel the difference from other countries. One of the things that was also interesting\
  \ , was my english car, which I got from my boss. I drove on the left only once,\
  \ while living on Bahamas with european car. But I never drove on the right with\
  \ an english car. It was quite difficult, I must say, but I got used to it. My boss\
  \ needed me in England, where I got another car, a proper English one. I think,\
  \ this was one of the most challenging thing for me to drive in England for the\
  \ first time in my life. I am good with google map, but that wasn\u2019t enough\
  \ for me in order to drive correctly. I was shaking and I was so terrified how I\
  \ am gonna survive. But I did and it was kind of fun at the end. In general I love\
  \ challenges and no matter how hard it is, I will never give up. I will always find\
  \ a solution. Unfortunately, I had to leave my home where I left my heart, but I\
  \ know I will be back again. \U0001F51C"
