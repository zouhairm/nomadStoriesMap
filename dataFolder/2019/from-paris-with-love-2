Text: "Paris is the city of lights, but most refer to this as the city of love. Paris\
  \ is filled with romance and love. Love of the history, love of the food, love of\
  \ wine, and of course love for another. As a little girl, one has always dreamed\
  \ of going to Paris with a significant other and get swept up in the romance of\
  \ it all, it\u2019s almost impossible not to now that I\u2019ve actually gone. \n\
  The Arc de Triumph has the best views in the city in my opinion. If you are into\
  \ love, the wall of love at Montmartre was breaktaking. Who can go to Paris and\
  \ not stop to see the Mona Lisa and really take it all in, well at least from where\
  \ the rope and stantions allow you to. \nAs a single women who had just turned 30,\
  \ i found the expectedly unexpected in Paris. \nThe food, the wine, the pastries\
  \ are probably some of the best I\u2019ve ever had. That means a lot coming from\
  \ a wanderlust and foodie. The history and architecture just walking down the street\
  \ made one stop and really appreciate how far our world has come. \nHowever, none\
  \ of this was what I left with. I found love in Paris, but it was a love of myself.\
  \ A love for the adventures I was about to embark on. Paris has a way of making\
  \ you feel like the impossible is not only possible, but within reach."
