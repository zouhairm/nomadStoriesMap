Text: "October, 2013 catapulted me into Bali, Indonesia. I had never traveled that\
  \ far in my life, not to mention traveled that far alone. Up until that point, I\
  \ hardly knew anything about Bali let alone had any desire to go Southeast Asia.\
  \ Yet, Life had cleared the way and I was moved beyond understanding to go. So ...\
  \ I went.\n    After 17 hours of travel and a long layover in Australia, I finally\
  \ arrived at my quaint hotel in the wee hours of the morning tucked away in the\
  \ jungles of Ubud. I was greeted by a charming staff member whose presence felt\
  \ so kind, comforting and oddly familar. I was shown my to my room and promptly\
  \ crashed into a deep sleep. \n   The next morning as I sauntered into breakfast,\
  \ I was greeted again by the same staff member and a few others who shared the same\
  \ comforting presence and familiarity. Their eagerness to exchange pleasantries\
  \ and inquire more about me really sparked something in my soul. Even though we\
  \ had just met, these interactions bore a strange resembleance to a reunion - a\
  \ celebration of meeting up again with a long lost friend. \n   What transpired\
  \ over the next couple weeks was equally as surprising and heartwarming. Wherever\
  \ I went, I was met and embraced by others with a spirit of celebration, deep welcoming\
  \ and an ease in connection -  with perfect strangers. Even time spent in an elephant\
  \ sanctuary with those giant, magical creatures felt natural. I\u2019d have these\
  \ strange but joyful sensations that maybe I \u201Chad\u201D been here before ...\
  \ with all of these people and animals ... from some other distant lifetime. \n\
  \   Well, it was all so incredibly touching and impactful that several months later,\
  \ I uprooted my life and moved to Bali. And these people that I hardly knew yet\
  \ felt like family, welcomed me even further into their hearts and lives.\n   Mayun\
  \ helped me find my first living quarters and taught me how to ride a motorbike\
  \ in his village. I rode around and around the soccer field, getting my bearings,\
  \ while the little kids outside giggled in delight at the sight of me. \n  Mayun\
  \ also took me to one of his soccer games my first night back in Bali and further\
  \ arranged for me to have a healing ceremony with his uncle - a priest. His uncle\
  \ gave me this tiny vile filled with a mixture of healing ingredients. When I meet\
  \ a man I am truly interested in, I\u2019m meant to pour some the liquid on my right\
  \ hand and shake this person\u2018s hand! ( Mayun and his wife also took me to the\
  \ movie theater in Bali).\n  Indrah, another kind soul, drove me clear across the\
  \ island to a spiritual center for a service. He waited for me while I attended\
  \ and then brought me back - also reluctantly allowing me to treat him to a coffee\
  \ at a Starbucks! Dewa another soul-friend showed me a beautiful, local temple and\
  \ then introduced me to his sweet family at their home. He played guitar while his\
  \ sister and I sang popular American songs. \n   Perhaps one of the more magical\
  \ moments was a time I got to share my own healing capacities with some of my new\
  \ friends. Some of my talents and abilties include energy work and intuitive card\
  \ readings. One day while visiting the hotel where my friends worked, a line accumlated\
  \ near the couch I was sitting on. Mayun had told them about my work and suddenly\
  \ people gathered to share with me their current trials and heartaches, hoping that\
  \ my healing abilties and inspiring messages might bring them some answers and relief.\
  \ It was such a touching moment to again have these seeming strangers bear their\
  \ souls to me - to open their hearts and trust. \n    One of the many lessons I\u2019\
  ve taken away from all of these experiences is the profound nature of connection.\
  \ It doesn\u2019t require much at all to begin and make a difference - a smile,\
  \ a curiosity, an openness, a kindness offered. These ingredients can put together\
  \ a magical concoction for meaningful friendships and changing life trajectories.\
  \ It sure did for me. And I hope it did for them too."
