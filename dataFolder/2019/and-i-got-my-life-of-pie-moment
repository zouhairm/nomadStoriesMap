Text: "I woke up too early that day. Not because my wooden bed was too basic or because\
  \ I didn\u2019t sleep well worrying that there was absolutely no stuff in my room\
  \ except a single yellow lamp and my cellphone was anyway out of range. All this\
  \ was new for me as I never had travelled alone. But I could not sleep that night\
  \ as I was excited for the big day. The day for which I travelled more than 2064\
  \ Km from my hometown Pune to the east coast of India- Sundarban. To have a single\
  \ sight of the famous stripy big cat of Bengal. \n\nThe time I headed off to my\
  \ journey, I was already dreaming like I am travelling through the narrow water\
  \ channels between the mangroves and suddenly I spot something in between the breathing\
  \ roots on the bank. Eyes. Still and Green. Looking at us. This by the way obviously\
  \ no other person on my boat- not even the local fellow rowing the boat could spot!\
  \ I whisper- \u2018\u2018Guys we have a Tiger at 11 O\u2019Clock!\u2019\u2019 All\
  \ eyes run towards there and he stands up posing with all his glory like he was\
  \ waiting for my camera to make that click sound. \n\nI was almost about to take\
  \ a selfie with the Tiger when I saw my boat and noticed that it\u2019s not going\
  \ to be a row boat. In fact it was much bigger and considerably noisy. Some peculiar\
  \ question came in my mind which suspended all the dreamworks. I stepped up and\
  \ grabbed a seat trying to imagine a different version of the story. A Japanese\
  \ woman who sat next to me started talking to me. I could not understand much, but\
  \ all I could catch was her elation and the word \u2018Tiger\u2019. The forest guide\
  \ on the boat, sipping Indian tea looked at us without a single expression. Maybe\
  \ he is thinking that the naivety is in abundance here, I thought! As the boat started,\
  \ enough doubts made their way to my dreamy picture. The water channels were big\
  \ and it was not possible to spot any animal with a clear view until you use a bino.\
  \ \n\nThe Sun was becoming hotter and hotter and I suddenly felt too foolish. There\
  \ was hardly any possibility for some Tiger to be so be so self obsessed to come\
  \ out of the mangroves in that temperature just to get clicked by a bunch \u2018\
  touristy\u2019 tourists. And a starry-eyed girl was left in the middle of Sundarban\
  \ forest at the mercy of a potential poser!  Well, and guess what, this time I was\
  \ right! \n\nStill, as I took my plate of a simple Bengali dinner back in my village\
  \ stay that day, I was not sad. Apart from all the \u2018realization of the reality\u2019\
  , I had seen beautiful Blue and Black Headed Kingfishers, lot of Herons and Mudskippers,\
  \ a stunning Monitor Lizard entering into the forest with its signature walk and\
  \ two sunbathing Crocodiles. I had seen Spotted Deers, Antelopes, Wild Bores, monkeys\
  \ playing on the mud and not a single footprint of a Tiger!\nI was just about to\
  \ finish when the local guide came all charged up. \u2018\u2018Who\u2019s coming\
  \ with me for a boat ride?\u2019\u2019, He asked. It was 9.30 in the night and around\
  \ 10 of us were in two small rowboats, floating right in the middle of narrow mangrove\
  \ channels just alongside the village. \n\nIt was too dark to spot anything even\
  \ if we had a good moonlight. Was that risky? May be yes. But I could not find any\
  \ reason to say no to it. Nobody was speaking. Trying to feel the silence, catching\
  \ up remote sound of Herons. I was looking at the paddle going forward and backward\
  \ and I watched it for the first time! Little sparkles. I slowly put my hand into\
  \ the water and moved. My heart was pounding just like I would have found my hidden\
  \ big cat! \nIt was Phytoplankton! Silent stars sparkling in the water with each\
  \ movement. The poser in my dreams had taught me something in that single day. And\
  \ a starry-eyed girl had got her \u2018Life of Pie\u2019 moment right there!"
