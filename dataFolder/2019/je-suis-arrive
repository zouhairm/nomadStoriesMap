Text: "He and I had been exchanging emails for months. We had recently started video\
  \ chatting, so I was sure he was a real human being. He was charming, well-spoken,\
  \ and decidedly French. \n\n\u201CWhen are you coming to Paris to visit me?\u201D\
  \ He would always end our Skype conversations with this question. \u201CI want to\
  \ show you my city.\u201D\n\n\u201CI don\u2019t know\u2026\u201D I would reply.\
  \ I had moved to Germany a few months prior, and had not yet been to Paris. It seemed\
  \ risky to me, an American, to jaunt over to another country in order to meet someone\
  \ in person. Sure, online he was witty and well-spoken. His first message to me\
  \ was so poetic that, despite the 1,000 kilometres between us, I couldn\u2019t resist\
  \ replying. And we had a lot in common; our conversations would last for hours,\
  \ and we still never ran out of things to say.\n\nFinally I decided, what did I\
  \ have to lose? So I booked a flight and hotel for a weekend in the city of lights.\n\
  \nHe was thrilled. Every day he told me he missed me, he had so many things planned\
  \ for the weekend, and he simply couldn\u2019t wait until I was there with him.\
  \ Then, the day before my flight, I got this email from him:\n\n\u201CDo not come\
  \ to Paris. I won't be there. Something happened\_down South\_that requires my immediate\
  \ attention. I'm so sorry.\u201D\n\nI wrote back that I was so disappointed to hear\
  \ the news. But, the flight and hotel weren\u2019t refundable at this late date.\
  \ I tried to remain friendly and upbeat in my email, but inside I was terrified.\
  \ My first solo adventure, with no one to meet me and show me their favourite secret\
  \ spots in a huge city. Not to mention, I\u2019d expected to have a romantic weekend\
  \ with an exotic Frenchman, and instead would be in Paris, alone. I had second thoughts,\
  \ third thoughts, back and forth in my head as I packed my suitcase. But ultimately,\
  \ I got on the plane.\n\n\u201CJe suis arriv\xE9!\u201D I proclaimed in my last\
  \ email to him. \u201CLet me know if there\u2019s anything I shouldn\u2019t miss\
  \ while I\u2019m here!\u201D I never heard from him again.\n\nIt was a rainy weekend\
  \ in January, which seemed apropos to my bruised ego and heart. Walking the damp\
  \ cobblestone streets under a blanket of gray clouds made me feel like the protagonist\
  \ in a French movie. I smiled bravely in the occasional selfie in front of the Arc\
  \ d\u2019Triomphe or the Cat\xE9drale Notre-Dame. I took a walking tour, during\
  \ which I met a fellow solo traveler, and told her my story over lunch on the Ile\
  \ de France. I used my broken French with numerous bakery owners, as I buried my\
  \ sadness under layers of gleaming \xE9clairs and colourful macarons. It was far\
  \ from the passionate rendezvous I had envisioned.\n\nBut, as I boarded the plane\
  \ home, I thought to myself, \u201CI did it.\u201D\n\nI didn\u2019t need another\
  \ human to meet me at the airport, to help me find my hotel, to be responsible for\
  \ showing me a good time. I did it all on my own. I still felt sad, but also proud,\
  \ and somehow, liberated. Maybe my trip wasn\u2019t perfect, but, it was better\
  \ than never seeing Paris. And although it can be lovely to share a travel experience\
  \ with someone you care about, it can be just as rewarding to do it alone."
