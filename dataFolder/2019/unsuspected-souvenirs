Text: "The small beach town of St. Simon's Island, Georgia, was enchanting. Its quiet\
  \ streets and friendly locals made you feel as though you were on a remote island\
  \ all its own, rather than a barrier island off Georgia's coast. I couldn't have\
  \ expected to find everything that I did\u2014including a new love\u2014in this\
  \ wondrously different landscape from my home. The area is known for secluded beaches\
  \ and wildlife-filled marshes, along with giant, sprawling live oaks lining streets\
  \ and taking up whole fields of their own. An abundance of Spanish moss wafted softly\
  \ in the cool breeze from every branch of every tree that we saw, giving a whimsical,\
  \ almost ethereal touch to the island.\n\tThough practically in my backyard, St.\
  \ Simon's Island feels a world away. It is only a five-hour drive from my home in\
  \ Atlanta, but I was surprised and enlightened to learn that Georgia, where I\u2019\
  ve lived my entire life, contains such a uniquely beautiful coastal area. While\
  \ in St. Simon's, I learned just how diverse and beautiful my home state can be,\
  \ and came to appreciate it in a completely new way\u2014for many reasons.\n\tThis\
  \ quaint town was so unexpectedly magical that my travel companion and I fell in\
  \ love in\u2013 perhaps  due to the seclusion this wonderfully peaceful place offered\
  \ from our busy, day-to-day lives. Several times, we walked along the beach holding\
  \ hands as two men together, something that can usually be fraught with anxiety\
  \ in small, Southern towns. However, we felt completely accepted, a fact that convinced\
  \ me even more that this place was magical. Throughout the trip, we were overtaken\
  \ by the calming effects of the clear air and the quietness of the town and romantic\
  \ feelings blossomed where I didn't know there was space for them. St. Simon's gave\
  \ us the chance, acceptance, and freedom we needed to truly bond, away from everyone\
  \ we knew and the pressures of life.\n\tWe returned home with something neither\
  \ of us thought we would: a partner.\n\tWe discovered a charming, towering lighthouse\
  \ at the southern end of the island that is still in use, keeping ships safe as\
  \ they come into the ports. Together, we climbed the 106-step spiral staircase to\
  \ the top and came out on the deck into the crisp, afternoon air. From this vantage\
  \ point, we stood together, shared a tender kiss and quietly looked out at the sea.\
  \ The day was chilly and overcast and a light fog had settled in over the water,\
  \ giving a mysterious, almost isolating feel to our location. At the moment, we\
  \ truly felt alone and fully embraced each other at the edge of the lighthouse.\n\
  \tOn this particular cloudy day, what we couldn't see from the lighthouse was close\
  \ neighbor Jekyll Island, a place that we discovered the next day contained just\
  \ as many wonders and adventures as St. Simon's. One of those wonders is its unique\
  \ Driftwood Beach, a coast of sand littered with driftwood, fallen and decayed trees,\
  \ and a wall constructed of boulders. It's said to be one of the most romantic beaches\
  \ in the U.S.\u2014a theory that proved accurate in our case. It's weird to think\
  \ of driftwood and dead trees as romantic, but I believe the oddly shaped trunks,\
  \ the silence of the area, and the view of the lighthouse in one direction and the\
  \ ever-continuing Atlantic Ocean in the other contributes to this effect.\n\tDuring\
  \ this trip, I learned more about my state\u2014and about myself\u2014than I thought\
  \ I could. The way I see people and places and the way they can affect me has changed.\
  \ My time on St. Simon's Island opened my eyes to the fact that you don't always\
  \ have to travel far from your home to have great experiences or to meet\u2014or\
  \ become closer to\u2014people that could change your life forever. Sometimes these\
  \ experiences are closer than you would expect\u2014you just have to be open to\
  \ finding them. The person I went with\u2014and our relationship\u2014changed dramatically\
  \ over the course of the four days we were gone, and we have since returned with\
  \ an entirely different dynamic.\n\tThese are souvenirs that I will never discard\
  \ or forget."
