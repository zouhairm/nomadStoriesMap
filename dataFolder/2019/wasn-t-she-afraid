Text: "Still with my eyes closed, I can hear the adults talking outside and someone\
  \ moving pans around the kitchen, between the noise of the neighbor\u2019s power\
  \ generator and the whistle of the bird that seems to live on the backyard. When\
  \ I open my eyes, I see the gray mosquito netting hanging above me and the thin\
  \ cotton mattresses standing against the cement wall, indicating that the girls\
  \ are up already.\nIn a fast movement, in order to accomplish the silly bet I made\
  \ with myself, I try to get rid of the net hung in the ceiling. I ignore the fact\
  \ that the bed is very close to the ground, so I hit my feet really hard on the\
  \ concrete floor and immediately regret of it. I remember the stories told the night\
  \ before about the frequent visits of scorpions, which is why they advised us to\
  \ never walk barefoot.\nWhile I have my \u201Cmata-bicho\u201D \u2013 which means,\
  \ literally, something like \u201Ckill the animal\u201D, what corresponds to \u201C\
  breakfast\u201D, in Portuguese from Portugal \u2013 half of dozen of people enter\
  \ and leave the room, starring curiously at me. All of them greet my parents and\
  \ the host couple, promising to return later for the religious soir\xE9e. Among\
  \ those people there is a woman, around 24 or 25 years old, who leaves her little\
  \ daughter under the care of the host mom, so she can go to work at a Angolan street\
  \ market, known as \u201Cpra\xE7a\u201D. Little by little I get closer to the girl,\
  \ doing funny faces in an attempt to become friends with her and, after a few minutes,\
  \ we are playing together in the yard, building little mud houses with the other\
  \ kids that have joined us.\nWe spend the entire day playing. We went to the dry\
  \ river, where the adults were caving wholes looking for water, to play nearby the\
  \ big \u201Cembondeiros\u201D \u2013 typical national trees, also known as Baobab\
  \ \u2013 and, altogether with the older girls, we sew up some dresses for the rag\
  \ dolls.\nAt the end of day, as agreed with the girl\u2019s mother, she returned\
  \ to pick her up and was surprised to see her daughter playing with me.\n- Wasn\u2019\
  t she afraid? \u2013 she asked astonished pointing to the girl.\n- Why would she?\
  \ \u2013 questioned the host mom \u2013 She was very enjoyable the entire day.\n\
  - Oh, it\u2019s because she has never seen any white person before, so I thought\
  \ she\u2019d be scared!"
