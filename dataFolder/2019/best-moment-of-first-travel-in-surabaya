Text: "I was high school student when i expected to backpacking overseas. i knew that\
  \ i don't have enough money for travel overseas at that time, so i made mini plans\
  \ to travel in home country with my friend. I chose Surabaya city which located\
  \ in east java to travel because i read some news and books told about Hitler's\
  \ grave was there (it's like conspiracy theory) and i went there to proof it also\
  \ visit Surabaya zoo to proof what Australian ministry said in news . Surabaya is\
  \ second biggest city in Indonesia. Mostly, they speak Javanese. Surabaya has full\
  \ of heroic memories in past. It\u2019s called heroic city in Indonesia. The only\
  \ trouble here is so hot temperature.\nso i arrange low budget to go to Surabaya\
  \ in my last holiday at high school. i brought Rp. 700.000 ($47) and i thought i\
  \ bought much moneys. my friend and i stayed 3 days 2 night in Surabaya. we don't\
  \ booked hotel because we thought my cousin's house was choices. so we start our\
  \ trip from Solo city at 20.00 pm. we ride a bus (we pay $2,5) for 10 hours and\
  \ stopped in Sidoarjo to met our schoolmate. at morning, we headed to Surabaya by\
  \ minivan (or angkot). i told my schoolmate that we want to proof hitler's grave,\
  \ visit surabaya zoo, visit my dream university and ended to my cousin's house.\
  \ Oh ya, I also have penpal from Surabaya. So I want to meet local to tell me about\
  \ Surabaya vibes.\n\tAfter we arrived to Surabaya, my friend and I was stopped in\
  \ Surabaya zoo. We visited that zoo and felt that was so quiet from any animals.\
  \ I believe many animals die, I\u2019m sad to know it. But, it was nice zoo for\
  \ visit. It\u2019s good for refreshing at weekend. Then, we check out from Surabaya\
  \ zoo to Surabaya iconic statue. We made a selfie :0 and we opened our maps to check\
  \ our next routes. We were shocked because it was complicated to find some places\
  \ from real maps. and We decided to rest in my cousin\u2019s house. At noon, we\
  \ went to hero monument to commemorate the services of hero. When we back to home,\
  \ my auntie cook local food, it called kupang. It made from small shells, it was\
  \ so yummy.\n\tNext morning, we were going to explore the biggest mosque in Surabaya\
  \ : masjid al-akbar. It was nice mosque with blue color. The area around there was\
  \ nice and friendly. We meet local there and told us about cheap shopping merchandise\
  \ close from mosque. After it, we went to Institut Teknologi Sepuluh November (ITS),\
  \ one of best university here. We meet the local again that guide me around this\
  \ campus. The campus was like forest, because full of tress. I love it much.\n\t\
  In our last day, I passed my dream university: Airlangga University (now, I\u2019\
  m a student there \uF04A). I\u2019m heading back to Yogyakarta City. I cancelled\
  \ my trip to proof Hitler\u2019s grave because I don\u2019t have enough time. Actually\
  \ I\u2019m so sad about that but at all, Surabaya give me more reasons for travel\
  \ to others cities even overseas."
