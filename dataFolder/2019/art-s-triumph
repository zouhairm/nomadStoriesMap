Text: "\u201CScotland? What do you want to go there for? They have a different accent\
  \ and use the pound and that\u2019s as much difference as there is between here\
  \ and there.\u201D\n\nMam\u2019s voice rang in my ear as I wound my way down Edinburgh\u2019\
  s Royal Mile. \n\nExactly Mam. Imagine living next door to your cousins and never\
  \ bothering to call for a cup of tea. Not knowing anything about them except that\
  \ you\u2019re of the same family tree. \n\n\u201CIt\u2019s better I go now instead\
  \ of in a year\u2019s time when it\u2019s quite possible that I\u2019ll need to\
  \ buy a visa for travelling outside of Europe Mam.\u201D I had replied.\n\nSheer\
  \ luck, or maybe fate, landed me here upon the closing day of a festival I confess\
  \ I had never heard of. The world\u2019s biggest arts festival - The Edinburgh Fringe\
  \ Festival.  It\u2019s not difficult to surmise why Edinburgh is the lucky host\
  \ of such an inundation of artistic talent once you have set foot within the city.\
  \ Traipsing through the cobbled streets, the spectres of luminaries and sorcerers\
  \ gone by whisper in your ear enticing you to follow this path to the Witch\u2019\
  s Well or that one to the real-life Diagon Alley. \n\nThe breath of the bohemian\
  \ soul flitted between us all, breathing childlike amazement into concrete adult\
  \ lungs. Ravenous eyes gnawed upon the lines of glittering wooden stands, ripe with\
  \ silky cashmeres, luxurious liqueur-infused chocolates and garlands of garish tartans\
  \ competing brutishly for attention. A velvet swathed display crawling with jewel\
  \ encrusted insects rattled ominously but remained upright despite the jarring blow\
  \ it received from two youths wrestling past on their way to the next street performance.\n\
  \n\u201CShall we move further away from the castle so we have a better view of the\
  \ show?\u201D I asked my partner when the sun began to drift lazily below the smattering\
  \ of chimney tops peppering the skyline. \n\nAll around us, a battle was being fought.\
  \ Whimsical turrets pierced the bruising sky in a call to arms while wrought iron\
  \ balconies clamoured together, facing the modern, glass-fronted architecture that\
  \ colluded in their upheaval. The visceral struggle of a city clawing tooth and\
  \ nail to resist modernisation, and with over 75% of its buildings holding a listed\
  \ status, we have to admit it\u2019s winning. \n\nWe followed the deluge of people,\
  \ bustling like ants in one direction. Prince\u2019s street was so heavily pregnant\
  \ under the swell of eager eyes it seemed as if it had burst, washing waves of onlookers\
  \ down upon the rolling gardens nestled at the foot of the castle. From somewhere\
  \ down below the sweet smell of marijuana drifted up to us, mingling with the tangy\
  \ excitement rolling off the crowd.\n\nThere was not one face in that crowd that\
  \ was not rapt with joy. No bristling conversations about foreign trade policies\
  \ or scathing remarks about the \u2018vampiric\u2019 European Union and immigrants.\
  \ Here we stood, a coloured flag of race and religion on common ground ardently\
  \ awaiting the largest annual fireworks display in the world. Would the removal\
  \ of the United Kingdom from Europe change this place? Would it infringe upon this\
  \ outpouring of jubilant creative expression?\n\nTssss - thwa thwa! \n\nSprays of\
  \ red and gold bloomed across the indigo sky, bleeding scintillating showers of\
  \ stars down upon us. An acrid smell of sulphur assaulted us and it was as if the\
  \ extinct volcano on which the castle stubbornly sat had rumbled to life after millions\
  \ of years of stony silence.\n\nThe thunderous crackling of the fireworks wasn\u2019\
  t enough to mask our synchronous caws of appreciation and it was our appreciation\
  \ that drew us together - that bound us into a single, great, organism. For art\
  \ has its own way of bringing us together and making us whole.\n\nArt will continue\
  \ to live, breath, grow and flourish - regardless of divisive, rigid politics. Art\
  \ is a natural expression of the soul, it will always adapt and resist. The proof\
  \ is in the bones of bonnie Scotland\u2019s capital. Art will triumph."
