Text: "We all relate more than we know,\n\nWe never really tell the odd stories behind\
  \ the way we meet certain strangers. \n\nSometimes we feel too fragile of the depth\
  \ of openness and honesty it require. \n\nAn old friendly Irish man I met in Nairobi\
  \ is amongst one of the strangers I came across in my story. It was a connection\
  \ of depth wisdom, kindness and authenticity.\n\nI only knew him for a short period\
  \ of time in my life but he taught me an important life lesson to  that I took an\
  \ oath to align with my own personal growth.\n\nBeing born in Mogadishu, raised\
  \ in Nairobi until the age of 8 before migrating to a little countryside town in\
  \ England meant my lense of view and perspective of life was sheltered from the\
  \ harsh reality that unfortunate individuals live as life.\n\nIt was the summer\
  \ of August  2018, I decided it was the right time to go back to Nairobi after so\
  \ many years. \n\nJacaranda Avenue was a gated road covered with fresh purple petals\
  \ all along the walk pathway. The essence of it all made it worth the afternoon\
  \ walks that usually involved taking some sodas to the security guards and wondering\
  \ around the estate.\n\n\nAn old white man started walking towards me one afternoon,\
  \ I noticed  the celtic cap he was wearing, it looked similar to my partners football\
  \ jersey. \n\n'Hello there , good'afternoon'. \n\nI heard the Irish accent and couldn't\
  \ help but confirm that he was a celtic fan. Feeling homesick and a sense of relation\
  \ to England could only bring a grin out of my mouth.\n\n'Hello, I like your cap\
  \ '*pause* celtic is it ?. I stuttered\n\n'Oh your a fan of them' he responded surprised.\
  \ \n\n' I'm from England, but I was raised here and back home to finish some social\
  \ research.\n\nHe looked at me with such a serious face and said ' research, at\
  \ your age, you look about 15'.\n\nI awkwardly giggled and said ' I'm 25, I still\
  \ get asked for my ID in England'\n\n' what's your research on then' .. \n\nFrom\
  \ that afternoon we frequently bumped into each other on afternoon walks and he\
  \ exchanged  wisdom that brought a sense of belonging in my individual identification.\
  \ When your born into a nation that is considered as a failed state and are given\
  \ no choice to migrate, your journey usually ends up revolving around accumulating\
  \ different cultures and dealing with frequent marginalization of labelling. \n\n\
  This connection allowed me to understand in depth the systematic separation of nations\
  \ that we never talk about, the history of us all as one human race.\n\nUps and\
  \ downs,\nTears or laughter,\nRain or sunshine,\nWe all share the same sky,."
