Text: "A bangalore based boy who was pampered extremely by his parents till the age\
  \ of 23 steps on a journey to Guruvayur.. a sacred place in Kerala. He was so pampers\
  \ that he wanted to break the shell of being and travelling with his parents. He\
  \ boards a train to Guruvayur and checks into a hotel there. He was so fascinated\
  \ and wanted to lear more about his religion.For him this was not only a trip but\
  \ an eye opener  for his self understanding of Hinduism.he started to visit all\
  \ the temples in Guruvayur and realised there is a lot in this world and Hinduism.\
  \ From Guruvayur he boards a train towards ernakulam to visit a place called kochin.\
  \ He wanted to experience the culture there and for his narrow luck he experienced\
  \ the art of kochin the binaelle an art festival. He fell in love with the city\
  \ and returns back to Guruvayur. He couldn\u2019t sleep the whole night because\
  \ this was the last night of his solo trip to kerala. He spent the whole night in\
  \ a tea shop smoking and drinking tea and listening to old Malayalam songs at the\
  \ end you would be glad to know that person is me and this is my last day in Kerala\
