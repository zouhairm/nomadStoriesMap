Text: "\u201CSolo poco mas, por favor\u201D, I requested gripping the chipped yellow\
  \ handrail beside the open door, asking if we could drive a little further in order\
  \ to save myself a climb.  The response from the driver came, not through words,\
  \ but through a series of convincing engine revs as he urged his mass of metal to\
  \ continue  up the hill. Then, a minute later, upon recognising my homestay as we\
  \ rounded a second corner, I hopped off calling \u201Cchau, gracias\u201D behind\
  \ me and headed for the curb.\n\nThe journeys at the beginning of my time in Valpara\xED\
  so, however, had been a markedly different, less assured affair. \n\n- - -\n\nI\
  \ found myself standing in front of a metal gate covered in an array of climbing\
  \ flowers, beside me Teresita, a short, bubbly woman who was the \u2018Madre\u2019\
  \ of my homestay. We were waiting, or rather I was, to take a bus to Plaza Sotomayor,\
  \ just a minute or two walk from my Spanish school in the centre of town. \n\n\u201C\
  Baja al camino y toma los cinco uno dos al centro\u201D Teresita had instructed\
  \ as we walked out of the house, speaking very quickly \u2013 as is common for a\
  \ lot of Chilean people. This statement had made little sense to me at the time,\
  \ but when, upon spotting the 512 bus at the top of the street, she gave me an encouraging\
  \ nudge in the back I realised what she had been meaning. \u201CVamos, vamos\u201D\
  .\n\nI waved down the bus (or micro as the local service is referred to) and while\
  \ boarding heard the driver shout \u201Cquinientos cuarenta\u201D over his shoulder.\
  \ Though, his eyes remained fixated on the road despite the lack of traffic in the\
  \ hills; perhaps just a force of habit.  Seconds later a defined hand followed his\
  \ request in anticipation of payment, but when none was immediately forthcoming\
  \ he trained his impatient gaze on me. This meant, however, that he then became\
  \ the recipient of a blank, almost stunned, expression that had taken up residence\
  \ on my face as I searched for the English translation. \n\n\u201CQuiniento cuatenta\u201D\
  \ he repeated. Still lacking a translation and judging that I had taken enough time,\
  \ I resolved to reach for the thousand peso note stowed in my back pocket. The safest\
  \ way to settle my debt and avoid further embarrassment. \n\nMoments later as we\
  \ lurched away from the curb I was sent stumbling backwards into an empty seat beside\
  \ a man in a fluorescent jacket and across from a lady who was dressed for a day\
  \ at the office. The driver on the other hand, appearing to be framed by his surroundings,\
  \ was casually picking out my change with one hand, and wrestling the oversized\
  \ steering wheel with the other. Both of which seemed to have been glued onto the\
  \ ends of a pair of puppet-like sticks that emerged from a creased, off-white shirt\
  \ that had been unevenly rolled to the elbow just below a set of large sweat patches.\
  \ .\nThen, whilst taking a minute to settle myself more comfortably in my seat \u2013\
  \ one of thirty uniquely ripped faux, grey leather ones aboard that had been crudely\
  \ bolted onto an industrial metal floor \u2013 I noticed the beginnings of sweat\
  \ patches on myself as well as the morning got warmer and the sun burnt off the\
  \ sea mist that had settled overnight.\n\nHaving now joined the traffic on Calle\
  \ Chacabuco I watched as we sped through the streets and they transformed from grimy\
  \ backstreets, building works, and graffiti to cleaner architecture and the intricate\
  \ street art and murals that Valpara\xEDso is renowned for. It then occurred to\
  \ me, as I caught a glimpse of the port between a couple of buildings, that I would\
  \ soon have to signal to the driver that I wanted to get off which, judging by the\
  \ other passengers simply consisted of standing by the door. \n\nAs I did this,\
  \ hoping that I was right, I counted my change that I had held in my hand throughout\
  \ the short journey into my bag. Four hundred and sixty pesos left. Quiniento cuatenta\
  \ had meant five hundred and forty."
