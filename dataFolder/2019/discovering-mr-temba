Text: "\u201CYou are sick? Are you vomiting, madam?\u201D \n\t\nI read the text message\
  \ and can\u2019t help but shake my head and snort. I know exactly how Mr. Temba\
  \ would say that to me if he were here, head cocked like an inquisitive parakeet,\
  \ eyes glittering with mischief behind the wiry beard that gives him an illusion\
  \ of maturity. It\u2019s exactly how he looked at me as I stumbled out of the toilet\
  \ tent at Kilimanjaro base camp at 3 a.m., wiping the acrid taste of my regurgitated\
  \ dinner from my mouth with weak disgust.\n\t\nI couldn\u2019t believe he\u2019\
  d heard me out there in the frigid, damp hours approaching dawn. I\u2019d fallen\
  \ asleep to whispers and jovial laughter from the mountain guide tent a few meters\
  \ away - he\u2019d surely been up much later than I had. Not only that, I\u2019\
  d rather figured him for the last person to check up on me. He filled the role of\
  \ comic relief amongst his fellow guides, spreading vaguely believable rumors with\
  \ a serious countenance. His sarcastic remarks would most definitely get him fired\
  \ from any trekking job stateside. And yet, there he was, the sole person in camp\
  \ taking notice of my groggy and pitiful state.\n\t\n\u201CMadam, I heard very loud\
  \ vomiting. Was that you?\u201D \n\t\nAh, there it was. Never without a joke - but\
  \ I could tell he felt genuine concern. There was a soft heart in there under his\
  \ clownish masquerade. I was glad he couldn\u2019t see my weary face despite our\
  \ relative proximity to the freakishly bright, gargantuan moon suspended dreamily\
  \ overhead.\n\t\n\u201CI\u2019m okay, Mr. Temba. Just ate something funny.\u201D\
  \n\t\n\u201CGo rest, madam. Try not to be sick in your tent.\u201D\L\t\n\n\u201C\
  Thank you for the advice. Very kind.\u201D I manage a chuckle though I feel like\
  \ hell.\n\t\n\u201CYes, madam. You are welcome.\u201D Apparently feeling he\u2019\
  d satisfied his duties, he turned and ambled back towards bed with his uniquely\
  \ springy and bowlegged gait, lanky legs clad in the faded, worn jeans he spent\
  \ every moment of this trek wearing.\n\t\nI was not naive - I knew that mountain\
  \ guides in Tanzania were not flush with gear. Temba himself wore said jeans tucked\
  \ into unlaced boots with frighteningly smooth soles, ground down to a dull shine.\
  \ He was a funny character, that one. We referred to our other leaders by their\
  \ first names, but somehow he remained Mr. Temba to our group, always. Amadeus didn\u2019\
  t particularly suit him anyway. \n\t\nI hardly realized he was full of it until\
  \ he began spinning tales to the point of ridiculousness. By then I wasn\u2019t\
  \ sure if a single word he said was truthful. A gangly, surprisingly baby-faced\
  \ mass of contradictions, he was always ready with a subtle one-liner as he sauntered\
  \ along the rocky trails with a huge, folded umbrella casually hooked over one wrist.\
  \ He was an incongruous sight to say the least, but somehow entirely himself.\n\t\
  \nAfter a few days on the trip, he confided that he wanted to teach special needs\
  \ children, but required money for the certification programs. Guiding paid relatively\
  \ well. Somehow, despite his signature sassy attitude - he told our group once that\
  \ if we needed to warm our hands we should put them down the front of our pants\
  \ - I could see him working with kids. They\u2019d adore his gentle spirit and silly\
  \ clowning. We all did. \n\t\nHe was everyone\u2019s favorite and he knew it. After\
  \ all, who else did I overhear singing Rihanna songs with mirth-inducing solemnity\
  \ as I made my morning trip to the bathroom? Who else would get embarrassed because\
  \ I caught him dancing to Justin Bieber when he thought I wasn\u2019t looking? Our\
  \ group still references classic Mr. Temba incidents when we reconnect.\n\t\nThe\
  \ man definitely has staying power. When he told me that he\u2019d stay in touch,\
  \ I should\u2019ve known that would mean random messages at odd hours and spontaneous\
  \ What\u2019s App Swahili lessons. Now, as he fires teasing comments, I\u2019m far\
  \ from surprised. I understand that beneath the bravado is a sweet, dedicated soul\
  \ - and out of everything I brought back with me from Tanzania, our enduring friendship\
  \ means the most."
