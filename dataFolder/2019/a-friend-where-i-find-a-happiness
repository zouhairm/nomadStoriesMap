Text: Hello, I am Ade yati. I am Indonesian. Many years ago, I expected to have foreign
  friends. And by the time, finally I have many foreign friends. They come from different
  countries. But I have one best friend from Belgium. His name is Ettejani Bilal.
  He lives in Antwerp, Belgia. He ia not from Belgium originally. He is from Al-hoceima,
  Morocco. Them he moved to Belgium many years ago because his father got a new job.
  That we know, Belgium is the biggest producer of chocolate. I told him that I really
  like chocolate, but he isn't allowed me to eat too much because it is not good especially
  for the teeth. After that, he told me about the culture of his country especially
  in education. In Belgium, there are two types of school. First, school that speak
  dutch and German and second school that speak  French. He goes to school that speak
  french. But his siblings go to school that speak dutch and German. Besides that,
  he can also speak Amazigh (his own language) ), English, Arabic, little dutch and
  of course French. Day by day, I know him a lot. We share our own language together.
  He teach me French as well and I teach him Indonesian language, and also Javanese
  language ( my own language). He often send me a romantic words, we know that European
  people are romantic, and also him. For the first time, I got surprised but now I
  am usual with his habitual. He is very romantic man. I really wanna meet him. Why?
  To satisfy my curiousity. To know his cultures as well. To speak with him face to
  face. I wish I could meet him soon.
