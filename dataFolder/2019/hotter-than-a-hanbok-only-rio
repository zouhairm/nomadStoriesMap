  \ to calculate.\n\nIt was one of those hot summer days. Well, nothing compared to\
  \ the Brazilian summer. Let's face it, it's hard to imagine someplace warmer than\
  \ Rio de Janeiro. However, it was hotter than I imagined. Hotter than I dreamed\
  \ Korea could be. My body was prepared for the heat, but my mind? Not!\n\nI expected\
  \ to wear elegant looks, get the makeup intact and find a beautiful \"Oppa\", that's\
  \ what we call the \"crushes\" in Korea. However, I ended up sweating like a pig.\n\
  \nIf it discouraged me? Not even a little. I was determined to experience what Korea\
  \ was best for. My friends, all native, asked what I wanted to do. I decided that\
  \ more than the modern and technological side of Seoul, I wanted to live the traditional\
  \ and historical side. You know, see the architectural and cultural relics scattered\
  \ throughout the city.\n\nAfter a long talk in a coffee shop... Koreans love coffee\
  \ after lunch. I felt at home in this, although it was strange that they love iced\
  \ coffee in the summer. For me, coffee has to come down burning no matter the season\
  \ ... we decided that our destination was the Changgyeong-Gung palace. Originally\
  \ built as a summer palace for the kings of the Koryo dynasty.\n\nTo visit the palace,\
  \ it is charged \u20A9 3,000.00, but if you are wearing a Hanbok, Korean costumes\
  \ from the Joseon Dynasty, admission is free. The rent of a Hanbok, even if simple,\
  \ is much more expensive than the entrance. However, we decided that I deserved\
  \ a complete experience. So we went to a store specializing in Hanbok rentals. I\
  \ admit I was kind of lost, everything was so beautiful. My luck was the experience\
  \ and fashion sense of Danah and Yerang because if it was up to me or Myung-Pyo\
  \ we would never be able to decide. Together, we decided on a Hanbok whose Jeogori\
  \ (which refers to the upper part) was light blue and the Chima (which refers to\
  \ the skirt) was dark blue. Unfortunately, the Hanbok do not have pockets so we\
  \ had to rent a traditional purse. The clerk, very friendly, lent me a traditional\
  \ Korean fan.\n\nAnd everything was perfect ... until I left the store. Remember\
  \ the heat? It looked much worse under the many Hanbok cloths. However, Changgyeong-Gung\
  \ palace was so beautiful and preserved, that it was like stepping back in time.\
  \ I forgot everything as I walked. There was nothing to get my focus inside. Neither\
  \ the cuteness of Danah, or the funny comments of Yerang, Myung-Pyo trembling when\
  \ trying to speak Portuguese, or the heat ... Nothing caught my attention more than\
  \ the beauty of that place. Even the air changed in there. I'll never forget how\
  \ I felt. It was a funny feeling as if the technological Seoul I met days before\
  \ did not exist anymore. How could I be in the same place? It seemed impossible.\
  \ It was breathtaking.\n\nAs soon as we visited everything we were allowed to do,\
  \ there were parts that visitors could not enter, it was as if they pushed me back\
  \ and everything returned to normal. So I ran to the store to get my clothes.\n\n\
  Tired and sweaty, we went by subway to the house we rented and met other adventurous\
  \ friends. There, we eat and drink the memories of an unforgettable journey."
