Text: "Kuta Beach got me see in the dark. I have never known that I could find a lot\
  \ of things in the dim light, and I couldn\u2019t help by the excitement of a meeting\
  \ with my own self. \nBack then I was having a night walk. Bali at night, look a\
  \ little bit different. Amount of people on the street increased when the sky got\
  \ darker. \nI stopped across a long wall, the gate to get into Kuta beach. Snapped\
  \ in my head all of the sudden to come in there at the time. \nThe lights from nearby\
  \ restaurants, bars, and caf\xE9s illuminated small part of the beach, the rest\
  \ of the beach outspread beneath the dim light of the night. I ended up sitting\
  \ on the seashore. Small waves and the sound of water splashing the rocks, gave\
  \ my mind a therapy. \nI was not the only one sitting on the seashore. There are\
  \ others. Most of them seemed to have a deep talk. Some of them are laughing, and\
  \ some of them walking near the wave.\nKuta beach at night got me fall in love.\
  \ I came again the next day, to the beach. As usual, I was sitting on the seashore.\
  \ At the time I wasn\u2019t expecting the fact that there was a foreigner come near\
  \ me and was sitting a few centimeters away from me. He then said suddenly, that\
  \ he was once wanted to be a world traveller, but he was too afraid to start, until\
  \ he started it in his old age. He wasn\u2019t physically aged to me. I assumed\
  \ he is about 35 or so. \n\u201CThere are too many things we have to manage. A bunch\
  \ of promises are await, though some of them left abandoned. We are confused of\
  \ priorities. We are confused of decisions. We are confused to judge.\u201D\nHe\
  \ turned his gaze to the black ocean. I was able to feel the regret from his tone.\
  \ He was right. We give people promises that burden ourselves to death. He was right.\
  \ It was so hard to choose, what I should better do next, what is the better way\
  \ I should have picked. There were too much things to think about other\u2019s sake\
  \ until we forgot to drop the decisions for ourselves. \n\u201CSomehow I feel this\
  \ is too late for me to be someone I used to be dreamed of becoming\u201D\nHe lowered\
  \ his head down in between the talk. If words work to cure, I have a bunch to say.\
  \ I asked him whether he has any plan forward instead.\n\u201CI wanted to lost myself,\
  \ on the places in the world, for whatever how much the time left of mine\u201D\n\
  He didn\u2019t say much but I have gotten a lot from that. He left the place after\
  \ that. In some situation my crazy thought says that he might be someone God has\
  \ sent me to wake me up in this world. I just came a few mils away from my place\
  \ in Java, yet I already got this \u2018slap\u2019. I can\u2019t imagine what if\
  \ I come to more places and meet different people with different thoughts and perspective?\
  \ \nAfter that night I keep on coming to Kuta beach. If it wasn\u2019t because of\
  \ Kuta, I would never meet the man. The more nights I came, the more plans I have\
  \ gotten in my head. Maybe back then I was too much burdened by my old regrets.\
  \ I should have known that regret turns people into someone they couldn't expect\
  \ to become. I should\u2019ve forgiven myself, for everyone mistaken something they\
  \ couldn't turn back to fixed. \nBefore my flight back home, I came to visit Kuta\
  \ for the last time. It was about 10.30 am, I walked from hotel where I stayed,\
  \ to the beach. The wind passed against my face right when I arrived there, as if\
  \ trying to say \u2018hi again\u2019.\nIf Kuta was a person, I would like to hug\
  \ it. I will pull it tight then whisper thank you for helping me finding myself,\
  \ and to introduce me who I really am and what I really want in my life."
