Text: "Surrounded by hundreds of tourists on the most popular street of Barcelona\
  \ - Las Ramblas, I felt like I lost winter this year. When I left the city few months\
  \ ago, the summer was coming to the end. Today, getting off the metro in Plaza Catalunya,\
  \ the pleasant air of spring reminded me that I literally missed one season.\nAutumn\
  \ and winter in Ecuador were similar to our European spring, except that the equator\
  \ line runs across the country, so the sun rises and sets at the same hour. I never\
  \ really felt spring there, it was more like the accumulation of different seasons\
  \ during the day. Cool mornings, warm air around twelve o'clock and brisk afternoons.\
  \ \n- You came back! - my best friend Sophie saw me in the crow and greeted with\
  \ a bug hug. \nExactly 8 weeks ago Sophie was the last person I said goodbye to\
  \ before taking my flight to Ecuador. Every time I go on a journey, saying goodbye\
  \ to her is the hardest part. \n- What a pity you missed Halloween! I had a lot\
  \ of ideas for our costumes. Are you sure you did not meet any handsome vampire\
  \ or zombie on the plane? She asked intrigued.\n- I know it sounds strange, but\
  \ there was a very handsome guy sitting close to me and although we exchanged a\
  \ few glances, I did not want to talk. In the end, we got off the plane and each\
  \ of us went different way.\n- You missed the chance? What happened? - Sophie was\
  \ surprised by my sudden lack of interest.\n\"Something has changed in me, Soph\
  \ ...\" Ecuador changed me. I didn't expect to find so much love and appreciation\
  \ for myself... I feel like I don't need anyone else to bring the best from me.\
  \ I do it on my own.\n- Tell me! How did it happen that you and Aaron broke up in\
  \ Ecuador? You sounded very mysterious on the phone and I worried a bit...\n- Let's\
  \ start with the fact that I hurried too much, Soph ... I made the same mistake\
  \ as always. I followed a boy whom I barely knew and this time it was not a different\
  \ city or even a different country, but a different continent. I think fate has\
  \ taught me a lesson.\n- Don't mess with destiny, after all you followed your heart!\
  \ You had nothing to lose. If you didn't go, you would never really know him. I\
  \ am proud of you girl! -  Sophie's positive actitude was one of the reasons why\
  \ I valued her friendship so much. \n- You know.. I don't regret anything, no decision\
  \ that I made. But I promised myself that I would never put a man above my dream\
  \ again. Never! - I admitted bitterly. - Do you remember how happy I was on the\
  \ day of departure? How much did I dream about this trip? It all went away when\
  \ he changed his mind. He got scared of commitment, so I found myself alone at the\
  \ other end of the world. He said his dreams changed during the summer and I was\
  \ no longer included in his plans.\n- Oh, darling ...- Sophie sighed softly, trying\
  \ to find the right words for this absurd situation. Another one on my already long\
  \ enough list of love failures. -That's why you decided to go on your own and visit\
  \ Ecuador alone. Now I understand ... But look at it from a different angle, you've\
  \ achieved something amazing! Show me one person you know and who would not pack\
  \ up his things in this situation and come back home. You stayed, despite the pain\
  \ and disappointment, you fulfilled your dream. Only that matters! You continued\
  \ your journey alone for months! \n- For all my live I've been taught that no matter\
  \ how much I achieve and how far I get, I will never be fulfilled if I don't have\
  \ a man at my side.  It's over. I found my love in Ecuador and the person I love\
  \ the most today is looking at me in this mirror. - I said, smiling to myself in\
  \ the storefront."
