Text: "I stared at the horizon, watching the waves crashing on the shoreline. A light\
  \ breeze brushing over my face as I inhaled deeply. I was 25 years old, single and\
  \ alone for the first time since 16. Numbed by despair, I sat wiggling my toes in\
  \ the warm sand of Juhu Beach. I had travelled nearly 8000 miles to my mother\u2019\
  s hometown of Mumbai to escape the reminder of solitude. \n\nI closed my eyes, turning\
  \ off the outside world, if only, for a moment. I felt someone\u2019s gaze on me.\
  \ I turned my head to see a woman staring back at me, so vehemently, it was as if\
  \ her eyes bore into my soul. \n\nShe was a young woman, small in stature, with\
  \ crows feet hugging her tired eyes. She studied my every detail, slowly, so as\
  \ to not miss anything. I spoke broken Hindi to learn her name. As I asked another\
  \ question she appeared fearful, reluctant to reveal too much by answering more.\
  \ This reluctance was a custom I was all too familiar with.\n\nAisha and I sat silently\
  \ as the murky water swept over the sand erasing evidence of visitors. I made eye\
  \ contact with Aisha once again. She inhaled and then revealed she desperately wanted\
  \ to run away. She was forced into an arranged marriage, a custom I knew little\
  \ about. While she knew her parents had her best interests at heart her medical\
  \ degree was not up for compromise. She longed for the day she could finish her\
  \ education and live life on her terms. She was stuck at a crossroads. \n\nI was\
  \ touched she sought solace in me, a perfect stranger. Before I could express this\
  \ I was interrupted by a soft ringtone. Briefly glancing at the phone screen her\
  \ eyes widened. She ran toward the bus station without so much as a goodbye. \n\n\
  I returned my focus to the tides. I instantly felt liberated, blessed that I had\
  \ the opportunity to determine my own future. I was single with a sea of options.\
  \ I would find my fish one day."
