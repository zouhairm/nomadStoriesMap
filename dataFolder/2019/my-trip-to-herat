Text: "My trip to Herat\n\nSometimes the best part about going away for a little while\
  \ is the pretending process. Like when we pretend to have more money than we can\
  \ actually afford to spend. Or when we pretend that we haven\u2019t even thought\
  \ about work once. In any case, if you really need to silence your worries for a\
  \ few hours (or even a few days), a quick trip to the Cultural city Herat will do\
  \ the trick.\n \nBack in 2013 we were staying in the wild city of Herat. It was\
  \ loud, it was colorful, many different smells run through our noses. It was truly\
  \ a wow-experience to get to know Herat. One day we got the opportunity to hop on\
  \ a bus to a desert adventure. It was a bus tour with local guides on their way\
  \ to the far desert, stopping at a few small towns in the mountains. On the way\
  \ we crossed the shabit dam Adraskan district, and there are tons of tiny villages\
  \ hidden in the middle of nowhere. Really impressive\nWe spent the day in a small\
  \ group of tents. In a bigger tent, we all came together to have lunch. After enjoying\
  \ a kichiri ghosht landi and Vegetables, our new friends started to play some music,\
  \ and everybody started singing. The most impressive part of the whole day, however,\
  \ was something different. Have you ever seen 1 Billion stars? This is how we felt\
  \ whilst watching the clear sky in the cold desert. We both have never seen so many\
  \ stars.\n \n\n there is really only one way to reach this elite \u201Ccrown city,\u201D\
  \ and it is by crossing over the unbelievably beautiful mountains. The Strand, this\
  \ majestic, 40-mile-long mountain connects Herat to capital of Afghanistan in one\
  \ side and to neighbors country like Iran and India through chabahar, this city\
  \ has been recorded as the 100 beautiful city  in the entire world.\nBeautiful enough\
  \ for side seeing and long enough to travel and enjoy the clean weather. Unfortunately\
  \ it is similarly in Danger to travel some of the Districts And there are the Human\
  \ enemies, which fight against the freedom of living, women freedom and so on.\n\
  We decided to wake up early tomorrow of the day. We wanted to watch the sun climbing\
  \ up behind the mountain, and feel the first shafts of sunlight. This is when we\
  \ took the photo, trying to freeze those good travel memories\n\nHowever, once across\
  \ this awesome city , there are dozens of four to five star restaurants , featuring\
  \ some of the most beautiful oceans as well as the cultural foods . The average\
  \ cost for a dish at these restaurants range between 200afg to 800 afghani, which\
  \ may seem like high-end dining for most of us, but would be considered \u201Ccomfortable\u201D\
  \ for the affluent folks in Herat."
