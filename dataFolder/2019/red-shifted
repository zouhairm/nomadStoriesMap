Text: "The thing is, I don't even like camping.\n\nNevertheless.\n\nI went to see\
  \ the Outback because somewhere I'd heard that you simply had to see it if you went\
  \ to Australia. Uluru-Kata Tjuta National Park is a UNESCO World Heritage site.\
  \ It's a unique ecosystem. It's home to the oldest living culture on earth. Also\
  \ it's red, so red it red-shifts your vision and every other color becomes strange,\
  \ and it's huge, and Priscilla, Queen of the Desert was filmed there. Pictures don't\
  \ do it justice, they say. I brought my camera anyway. \n\nMy friends made sure\
  \ to remind me that I cannot set up a tent or start a fire. But that was at home,\
  \ and here I was different. I pressed my forehead against the bus window. It headed\
  \ for our first campsite as I watched trees that stretched bleached arms towards\
  \ a white sky, and kangaroos hopping in the distance, and hoped for real-life tumbleweed.\
  \ \n\nIt was hot on the bus, hot in the sun, hot for days. But I'd already taught\
  \ myself to like or at least endure anything. It's a superpower. I can talk myself\
  \ out of hating an experience so well that I actually love it, or at least what\
  \ it says about me. On that trip I ceased to hate sweating. Ceased to hate the layer\
  \ of dust on my skin after sleeping outside. Ceased to hate\u23AFeven, came to a\
  \ distant alliance with\u23AFthe long-armed, palm-sized bugs that dwell in the corners\
  \ of Outback port-a-potties. It was more than learning to like those things. It\
  \ was pushing away from the self that believed I couldn't.\n\nUluru itself is a\
  \ monolith, a thousand feet tall, six miles around, shaped by the wind over thousands\
  \ of years. Its outline is featured on postcards, billboards, logos, movies, TV\
  \ shows, all of which project it both into the outside world\u2019s imaginings of\
  \ Australia and Australia\u2019s imaginings of itself. On the base walk, which winds\
  \ through fine reddish dirt halfway around Uluru's circumference, I moved economically.\
  \ I conserved my energy to look, and to listen to stories about the Anangu people\
  \ who own the land and to see where the stories wrap themselves across the landscape.\
  \ I decided, in much the same way I decided many other things on that trip that\
  \ I wouldn\u2019t limit myself by any rules about who I was. If I wanted to be a\
  \ camper, I could be. I could appreciate it, and I did. \n\n\tFrom the ground, Uluru\
  \ seems the image of permanence. From a human temporal perspective, too: the Anangu\
  \ people have lived at Uluru for at least ten thousand years. I took careful pictures\
  \ of the pictograms on the rock, imagining ancient artists. I was wrong. \"The Anangu\
  \ are still here,\" the guide reminded me. \"They paint those. What you saw will\
  \ wash away in the next rain. Given, it doesn't rain much.\"\n\n\tI went to bed\
  \ hot but woke up in the middle of the night, freezing, in outer space. There was\
  \ nothing. There were stars. The day's cloud cover had passed through and all the\
  \ heat had been sucked up into the universe. In my sleeping bag, I wasn't some home\
  \ version or Australian version of myself. I was seven, laying on the beach in Virginia\
  \ with my mother, looking up at a sky that was deep in the same way. I was seven,\
  \ twenty-one, I was untethered from myself. It was like being alone\u23AFnot only\
  \ without anyone else, but without myself. It was like not existing at all. \n\n\
  \tThen, in the morning, it rained. Everything was green, and back at Uluru it must\
  \ have been washed clean. I roused myself for another hike, and I took in more amazing\
  \ scenery, and then a few weeks later I flew home and struggled to explain that\
  \ being there had been like being someone else, or maybe no one, and yes everything\
  \ had been fun because I'd decided I was a person who always had fun, and there\
  \ was something really terrifying about realizing that I was so flexible. Almost\
  \ flexible enough to bend with the wind into nothing, to cease to exist."
