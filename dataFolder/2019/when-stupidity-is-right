Text: "\u2014 Oh, God, look, what is written on the stone!\nAnton jumped up from the\
  \ stone and read with a changing face: \xABAnton Ignatov died here in a fight with\
  \ a bear on 13.06.2009\xBB. Anton wasn`t Ignatov, but this didn`t change matters.\
  \ We instantly froze as if due to a strong wind.\nI looked at the bending tops of\
  \ the pines and thought that 10 years ago these tops just as indifferently watched\
  \ when  a bear was killing a man.\nWe changed our mind about the dinner so we packed\
  \ up quickly and walked further along the ruined road. We went from 7 a.m., there\
  \ were about three and we had no idea how much more we would have to go.\nSilly\
  \ twenty years old children! In the morning we woke up in a tent on the banks of\
  \ the raging Katun River, breathed deeply, numb from the overwhelming power of the\
  \ Altai Mountains, the place where is Russia\u2019s spine and its carotid artery.\
  \ But It was unbearable to see here people around listening to music in open cars,\
  \ swallowing rivers of beer, hurling cans into Katun. We just wanted to stay eye\
  \ to eye with Altai.\nSo, we walked along a poorly delineated path, in light sneakers,\
  \ without any equipment, without even thinking that the road could lead nowhere.\
  \ Have you ever walked for 12 hours, without any purpose or experience, simply because\
  \ you have legs, you can go and therefore you go?\nWhen twilight began to gather\
  \ over the taiga, we became frightened. Fatigue, uncertainty and awareness of our\
  \ own stupidity. Everywhere there was a rotten smell \u2014  exact sign that the\
  \ bear had buried the victim for saving his future dinner. The water was over long\
  \ time ago and I was ready to drink water squeezed out of juicy moss.\nWe weren`t\
  \ led astray because we didn`t know where we were going. But we are definitely lost.\
  \ It was impossible to cry or to stop, it was impossible to go further and there\
  \ was no one to blame. Silly twenty years old children!\nDarkness is especially\
  \ strong before dawn. After 14 hours in the taiga, without seeing the sky and horizon\
  \ we saw a spacious green mountain valley where calm reigned. Quiet, clean and indescribably\
  \ tasty river flowed through the meadow. We drank, dropping to our knees like animals,\
  \ and beside us drank horses from the wild herd. We followed the sunset line and\
  \ saw smoke.\nA man of indeterminate age was sitting near the fire. He poured us\
  \ a hot drink from the pot and offered to put up our tent near his house. And his\
  \ house was dug in the ground and covered with several logs. He seemed to be about\
  \ 80 years old but he moved with the agility of a teenager and certainly more agile\
  \ than we are. His speech began to murmur like a mountain stream, he knew how to\
  \ feed on the gifts of the forest. \xABAre you a shaman?\xBB, \u2014 I asked naively.\
  \ \xABNo\xBB, \u2014 replied he too tricky. He invited us to stay, and we stayed\
  \ with him for two weeks. Maybe, the most important weeks in my life."
