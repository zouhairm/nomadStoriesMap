Text: "It was the spring of 2014 and I was unemployed, homeless and broke. I remembered\
  \ an old friend telling me about how he spent a summer in college living and working\
  \ in Yellowstone National Park and I thought why not?. I applied and 2 days later\
  \ I got a call offering me a job in the housekeeping department. I packed my bags\
  \ and 3 weeks later I was on greyhound bus to the first National Park Yellowstone.\
  \ ( I'm an aspiring writer currently working on my 1st novel about my time and adventures\
  \ in Yellowstone. Here is the Prologue) \n\n\t\t\u201CChayah, do you think hell\
  \ is hot?\u201D\nThe sad teenager I had the pleasure of sitting with at Tulsa memorial\
  \ hospital, floor 6, known as the psych level, never understood that I hated my\
  \ real name. Evie, my name is Evie, I secretly thought to myself. Then I felt bad\
  \ because this poor boy had attempted suicide more than fifteen times in his young\
  \ life, and all I could do was think about myself and my future. I guess I had grown\
  \ bitter, after all, I didn\u2019t go to fucking college and get a Bachelor degree\
  \ in international affairs just so I could get paid ten bucks an hour to make sure\
  \ the patients on floor six don\u2019t suffocate themselves with one of the facility\u2019\
  s soft pillows.\nI tried to do my job, but the boy tossed his bread at the wall,\
  \ and I realized I wasn\u2019t being selfish at all. I wanted to do something more,\
  \ I needed to be happy, and I wanted to start over before I too became a resident\
  \ on floor 6. \nThere was a time when I felt free, in Peru, volunteering and giving\
  \ water to the needy overseas. It was a work and study abroad program through my\
  \ college, and I felt like this was exactly what I was destined to do. I didn\u2019\
  t make a dime, but I felt like I was doing something good. \nIt had almost been\
  \ a year since I graduated from the University of Oklahoma and after a shitty summer\
  \ that I don\u2019t care to talk about I packed up my things and told my friend\
  \ who I lived with at the time that I needed a change.\nPenny wasn\u2019t pleased,\
  \ but I packed my bags and headed south to Dallas in my old Dodge (Blue Saturn)\
  \ car that I was certain would crash in the next twenty miles leaving me with my\
  \ thumb up on I-75 hoping to come across a trucker headed to Dallas. I was heading\
  \ to Dallas to stay with my sister Fari. Three months later, I was still unemployed\
  \ and checking my email for responses from the multiple places that had my resume\u2019\
  . Nothing, not one offer. \nMy sister was supportive, but I was far from optimistic\
  \ after three months of being unemployed. I didn\u2019t know what else to do, and\
  \ then my old friend from college gave me the light bulb I needed. He told me about\
  \ his six-month seasonal position at Yellowstone National Park. I thought, that\u2019\
  s interesting, it couldn\u2019t hurt to try; so I did. \nTwo days later, no joke,\
  \ a recruiter for the park called to interview me. I got the job, and I couldn\u2019\
  t stop shouting to my sister who looked confused.\n\u201CDoes this mean you are\
  \ going to be leaving soon?\u201D\nI knew she didn\u2019t want me to go, especially\
  \ considering baby sitters in Dallas charged twice as much as she had to pay me.\
  \ \n\u201CI\u2019m sorry girl, but this is good for me, I have to go\u201D\nMy sister\
  \ and I didn\u2019t speak for a while after I left, but I never regretted leaving\
  \ for one of the most beautiful places on the planet. You know how, when you imagine\
  \ something, and then it is either not as good in reality, or it turns out better,\
  \ but never does it turn out exactly the way you had imagined? That is exactly how\
  \ Yellowstone was. I had imagined all the things the Yellowstone experience would\
  \ be once I arrived. However, the Yellowstone experience was absolutely nothing\
  \ like how I imagined...It was better."
