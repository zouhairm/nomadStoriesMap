Text: "I\u2019ve just married the love of my life and we were on our way back home\
  \ from our honeymoon along the Garden Route in South Africa. We\u2019ve spent a\
  \ glorious week in tranquil Wilderness with its mountainous backdrops, and small-town-friendly\
  \ guest houses smugly overlooking the lagoon. It was the perfect location to reflect\
  \ on the new journey on which we\u2019ve embarked. We loved the peacefulness the\
  \ past week afforded us, but we were ready for some adventure again. We decided\
  \ to keep to the theme of our recent nuptials and celebrate the end of our honeymoon\
  \ living on the edge.\n\nSo, on our way home, we stopped for a brief walk through\
  \ the world renowned Knysna Forest, home to the mysterious phantom elephants, smart\
  \ enough to have evaded human sight and capture for the longest time. I\u2019ve\
  \ only ever read about these elusive giants back in school and it felt completely\
  \ surreal to finally stand here and take it all in. Although we couldn\u2019t see\
  \ them, we could certainly feel their mystical presence. \n\nFurther enroute we\
  \ stopped in Oudshoorn, the Ostrich capital of the world and an absolute must for\
  \ anyone visiting South Africa and who consider themselves true adventurers. In\
  \ Oudshoorn we went riding on the backs of real-life African Ostriches, checked\
  \ out the Ostrich museum and ate an Ostrich sandwich for the first time. All of\
  \ which were unforgettable experiences! \n\nNot really comfortable with confined\
  \ spaces, I decided to let my inhibitions go and dare, what I thought would be the\
  \ last adventure of our trip, the Congo Caves. It was lit! No, I mean it really\
  \ lights up in there, which transforms these caves into something out of this world\
  \ with the most amazing rock formations dating back millions of years. We\u2019\
  ve had the most venturesome day, but little did we know the day\u2019s adventures\
  \ were far from being over. \n\nSatisfied and a little tired from all the excitement,\
  \ we decided to take the \u201Cshort way\u201D home through the Swartberg Pass,\
  \ and it turned into the longest drive of our lives. Though, beautifully scenic.\
  \ \n\nSo, on a dirt road, best ventured with a 4x4, we found ourselves smack in\
  \ the middle of absolutely nowhere with our little old Honda Civic 1.7, and not\
  \ a single soul in sight, except for the family of baboons that we spotted a little\
  \ earlier. We were already too far in to turn around and, I must admit, way too\
  \ mesmerized with what lay in front of us and the Spectacular views that surrounded\
  \ us from all angles over both the Klein and Groot Karoo. The entire way we gawked\
  \ at the interesting geological rock formations. I\u2019ve never seen anything like\
  \ it, and it was so beautiful it scared me. How could this place even exist? Was\
  \ I in a dream? Did I just die in that cave back there and go to Rocky Mountain\
  \ heaven? I guess it was the unexpectedness of it all that blew me away. \n\nAs\
  \ with many of South Africa\u2019s passes that our traveling hearts have taken us\
  \ on in the past and since then, we spotted many baboons, presumably very happy\
  \ at the sight of human life. Unfortunately, we weren\u2019t so lucky to encounter\
  \ the leopards and caracal said to also be roaming the Swartberg Pass. Still shaking\
  \ with excitement, we came to what we would learn is known as the Wall of Fire -\
  \ a sight that until today I\u2019m unable to forget. A towering rock face that\
  \ glows fiery red in the setting of the sun, and the most amazing piece of natural\
  \ landmark I ever saw.\n\nAfter nearly two hours and 23.8 km of one discovery after\
  \ the other, we felt our wheels hitting the tar road. We were on our way home! We\
  \ wanted a day of adventure but ended up getting so much more than we bargained\
  \ for. \n\nThe thing I discovered with traveling through South Africa is, no turn\
  \ is a wrong turn, you just discover a new adventure and our life together has been\
  \ filled with many other adventures ever since."
