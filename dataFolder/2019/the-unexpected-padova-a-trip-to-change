Text: "I have always been addicted to travel planning. From Porto to Wroclaw, from\
  \ Budapest to Vienna, Paris to Rome, Brussels to Berlin: I always wrote the perfect\
  \ script before every trip. Each destination previously decided, already knowing\
  \ which train to take and which street to cross. Traveling with everything planned\
  \ has several benefits, but we rarely face the unknown. \nIn 2012 I was living in\
  \ Portugal and I went to Italy, to know Rome, Venice, Pisa and Florence. Something\
  \ in the Italian way has attracted me in a manner that I decided to return and live\
  \ there. As usual I started to organize my life in that sense. After living almost\
  \ four years in Portugal in 2014 I returned to Brazil and, in 2015, started college\
  \ (law course) and Italian classes.\n2017 arrived, and with it the moment of applying\
  \ to the internship program that I was looking for and the moment of choosing the\
  \ city in Italy I wanted to live. I was surrounded by options, including the famous\
  \ Rome, Florence, Verona and several others. It would be natural for me to choose\
  \ one of the most known options, a city that I could know before even arrive there.\n\
  But for the first time I decided to take a risk and confront the unknown. I chose\
  \ the city of Padova, a city that I never heard talking about and did not have any\
  \ information. I decided to not search much about Padova, only the necessary to\
  \ arrive there. 200 000 inhabitants, Italian language, half an hour by train from\
  \ Venice. The other information I decided to find out only when I started living\
  \ there.\nSaid and done, I moved to Padova literally taking a leap into the unknown.\
  \ I arrived in the city on a cold night, without internet or any telephone connection.\
  \ I remember laughing alone, walking in circles trying to find the super market\
  \ that was right next door.\nThis was the first of many times that I would walk\
  \ laughing alone, sometimes shedding tears of happiness. Each 'Buon giorno, per\
  \ favore' (good morning, please) was special and different.\nI saw myself talking\
  \ to people I would never met if I had found a house in the internet. I choose to\
  \ face the mission of walking hours by some days to find the perfect place to stay\
  \ during my adventure. And I found the place I could call home for six months, and\
  \ shared the house with two amazing girls from Greece (a culture that I a culture\
  \ that I knew nothing about).\nI decided to buy a used bike as soon as I find my\
  \ house to be my faithful company in every new adventure. The feeling of the cold\
  \ wind of less four degrees in my face, the sounds of the rivers I was crossing...\
  \ every second is in my memory.\nFor the first time I just let the life guiding\
  \ me, and was living the trip in a different way. I met people and places that I\
  \ never expected, and discovered the pleasure of these unexpected meetings.\nIn\
  \ one day I was taking a train and going to a close city, in the other I was getting\
  \ on a bus and going to the beach. In a week I just decided to take a plane to Portugal,\
  \ in the other I was in a boat party in Venice's waters.\nI discovered the possibility\
  \ of being organized and at the same time work with the unexpected. Travel to Padova\
  \ without knowing everything was the best choice that I could make. Discovering\
  \ old churches, huge museums, technology centers, different foods and drinks: each\
  \ place I went was the result of looking for the unknown.\nFrom all the trips I\
  \ have made, for sure going to Padova was the special one. Most important of all,\
  \ I allowed me to know myself by leaping into the unknown."
