Text: "There is more than one amazing trip I had, deciding which to describe it\u2019\
  s the difficult part. But, what is travelling really about? Is it about the people\
  \ you met?, the places you visited?, the food you tried?, the amazing views?, the\
  \ comfort and fanciness?. From my point of view, travelling it\u2019s more about\
  \ the things you learned from the experience, the way you felt and how the trip\
  \ changed the way you perceive the outside world. \nBased on that statement, I will\
  \ talk about the trip which impacted my life the most. I was 26 years old, I just\
  \ got a full scholarship to study abroad, first time I was going away that far from\
  \ my family, tacos and the chaotic city life I am used to as a Mexican. I left all\
  \ that stuff behind to pursuit a \u201Cdream\u201D and to live in a place I consider\
  \ now as the opposite of Mexico in many aspects. \nFirst day, I was received on\
  \ the front door of my new place by a girl of my age with a big smile and a hug;\
  \ I will discover soon that was highly unlikely coming from an unknown British girl\
  \ so let\u2019s say I was pretty lucky because I spent with her all year of my stay.\
  \ \nSoon, I was immersed in an extremely different kind of lifestyle, cycling to\
  \ school three days a week, going out to dance salsa on Wednesday night\u2019s,\
  \ learning new words such as \u201Caubergine\u201D, \u201Cscone\u201D or \u201C\
  cuddle\u201D, trying food products from the supermarket presumed to be Mexican style\
  \ which actually tasted like Indian food.\nEvery day it was so stimulating to my\
  \ brain and senses, I needed all my attention to catch and understand every word\
  \ people was saying to me, I have never coexisted before with people from such diverse\
  \ nationalities. I made friends with Thai, Malasian, Spanish and Italian people\
  \ from school, and I was roommate of Indian, Chinese and German girls, interacting\
  \ with them all time I was learning from their cultures, their way of thinking and\
  \ expanding my own mind-set without even noticing. \nI can confess I felt sometimes\
  \ a bit uncomfortable in a country like UK, mainly due to its neatness, strict rules\
  \ and lack of sun, but at the same time I admire its beauty, I will never forget\
  \ how green the grass was, even after a night of snowing, the grass remained fresh\
  \ and full of colour, I used to think the landscapes looked like they were already\
  \ \u201Cphoto-shopped\u201D.\nEven though not every day was smooth and easy and\
  \ I had to confront myself against loneliness and home-sickness, such struggle had\
  \ great consequences: I realized I cannot blame anyone for the outcomes of my own\
  \ actions, as obvious as it sounds, taking that statement to practice takes certain\
  \ wisdom. In addition, I discovered new activities I enjoy practicing with others,\
  \ like acroyoga, which I practice since then!\nThen, how did this trip make me feel?\
  \ I would say it refreshed my spirit, I felt greatful, inspired to create the life\
  \ I want, at some point invincible and truly blissful. Definitely it changed the\
  \ way I used to think about the unknown.  Thus, I am not the same person before\
  \ and after this great adventure! I guess it\u2019s part of nature to be constantly\
  \ looking for a change, and I would encourage everyone to try, to look after another\
  \ version of themselves by having great enriching experiences far from home."
