Text: "A random comment to my dad - \u201CI'm going to India\u201D and a blurry dream\
  \ of India set the stage years before this journey commenced. This would be the\
  \ first holiday without my father and I felt it was too lengthy of a time - encompassing\
  \ Christmas Eve, Christmas, my 61st birthday, New Year's Eve, and New Year - to\
  \ be at home without family and solo in Latrobe, Pennsylvania. The proclamation\
  \ and my desire coincided at the right time.\n\nA cacophony of sights, sounds, and\
  \ smells overloaded and pounded upon my senses. Honking horns, from every vehicle\
  \ imaginable, had a language of their own; chaotic traffic patterns; animals wandering\
  \ the streets or swinging from ledges or wires, smoke from open pits and cremations;\
  \ tangled kite string wire lying on the streets; electrical wire wound in circles\
  \ on poles; human waste and traffic; sellers barking their wares; and, trash heaped\
  \ everywhere were part of daily living. Contrary to what most people say, I found\
  \ India to have an excess and are abundant. They as yet haven't found a way to harness\
  \ this energy into a constructive way of life.\n\nObserving bodies being cremated\
  \ and participating in the Arti rituals on New Year's Eve gave me life changing\
  \ impressions on the concepts of life and death. What a difference between the evening\
  \ ceremonies on the Ganges with the fire and dancing and chanting and offering flower/candle\
  \ 'boats' on the water to the calm and quiet of New Year's Day with a Holy Man's\
  \ blessing. \n\nWhat dismayed me more than the experiences was a fellow seasoned\
  \ traveler's laughter at a comment our Naturalist guide in Ranthambore Reserve made\
  \ regarding the 'scientific method' used to study and track wildlife. Perhaps their\
  \ 'scientific method' meant 'intuitive process'. The traveler based the meaning\
  \ on his connotation. I shook my head while remembering an article stating 'research\
  \ in the west does correspond to results from the east's method of study; and, with\
  \ less time, money, and effort involved.\n\nMy first hot air balloon ride in Jaipur\
  \ was indeed an accomplishment, especially since I thought I was afraid of heights.\
  \ I initially declined the optional tour, yet thinking if that ride were canceled\
  \ then I would reconsider. The heavy fog did prevent the early morning ride and\
  \ was rescheduled for the afternoon. It was as good a sign as any to go. The ride\
  \ was glorious and not anything I anticipated. The village met us before take-off\
  \ and after landing celebrating this event like it was the greatest thing on earth.\
  \ My dad had been my anchor and I wanted to feel what it was like to be un-tethered.\
  \ I felt light and calm as we lifted over the land.\n\nMy soul connected to India's\
  \ soul and I received the message that India is our 'shadow land' and its soul takes\
  \ in everything humanity is unable to see or acknowledge or resolve. Their impoverishment\
  \ is ours; their overabundance is ours, and India will continue to be our shadow\
  \ until we listen and consciously act.\n\nThis passage from Robert Johnson's book,\
  \ Balancing Heaven and Earth, succinctly describes and supports my impressions:\n\
  \nSimanta taught me much of what I understand about India's history and philosophies.\
  \ For example, India does not sharply separate ego and shadow as our Western culture\
  \ does. India does not bar unpleasant human traits and experiences from every day\
  \ sight. There are no asylums, few hospitals as we are used to them, and almost\
  \ no orphanages, and life in all its extremes washes over one every day. The shadow\
  \ is represented in every corpse one passes on the street, every madman (they are\
  \ consider to be possessed by God) who comes by, every gigantic hole that trips\
  \ one up on the street while walking at night...\n\nAfter such an experience, one\
  \ becomes innocuous to life and death, and learns to live. India was an experience\
  \ I wouldn't have missed for the world."
