Text: "Not \u201CEat, Pray, Love\u201D. Single Travel. \n\n\nPeople travel alone,\
  \ constantly. I understand that. But it is new to me. While I have always admired\
  \ the brave women who do it, on a certain level, I guess, I have feared judgment.\
  \ And loneliness. I have been single for a long time now, but I hate being alone.\n\
  \nThen, recently, the calling to travel began. This time it was not the generalized\
  \ want for a vacation to anywhere. I could no longer stand to agree to traveling\
  \ to \u201CX\u201D city with a friend, just because she was planning a trip to go\
  \ there, and I lacked options. Nor can I fathom taking a $2,000 yoga-retreat trip\
  \ to Guatemala to stay at a resort and practice yoga daily. In Guatemala. Essentially\
  \ I am saying that the socially-acceptable single-female travel is no longer for\
  \ me, apparently.\n\nInstead, visions, and stomach butterflies, of Bali began to\
  \ flood my mind. Oh, and South Africa, too. My head, heart, and soul all gave a\
  \ resounding \u201Cyes\u201D when I viewed photos of the temples, plant-life, beaches,\
  \ volcanoes, amazing snorkeling, yoga, native cuisine, and even scooters, in Bali.\
  \ I mean, and what of the Chef\u2019s Table episode featuring Will Goldfarb\u2019\
  s move to Bali, and embrace of local ingredients in his new Balinese restaurant?\
  \ You may find yourself unsure about your feelings for the eccentric Goldfarb in\
  \ that episode, but you simply cannot ignore the beauty, serenity, and humility,\
  \ of Bali, and its people.\n\nI told a few people about my desire to travel to Bali.\
  \ I received immediate responses, from multiple people, calling my desired trip\
  \ \u201CEat, Pray, Love.\u201D I was taken off-guard, actually, by these responses.\
  \ This reference signifies the trip of a lost, seeking, middle-aged female. Let\
  \ us just Cut. That. Out. Soul-searching, and solitude, can be beautiful things.\
  \ But so are experiencing the beauty of a country, and culture, unknown to you,\
  \ and having the time and energy to connect with locals, and to truly experience\
  \ life in another country. To have the trip of YOUR dreams, and, perhaps, finally,\
  \ a trip where there is no requirement to compromise with a friend or partner\u2019\
  s wants, needs, and drama.  \n\nTraveling and experiencing the world can, truly,\
  \ feed the soul. This experience is open to single women and men, and you do not\
  \ need to wait for a friend to do it.  Sure, make sure you are safe, but, in the\
  \ age of the internet, research, and planning, are easy.\n\nAs for my trip to Bali,\
  \ it is booked. I still needed to save a bit of cash to make it happen. But it is\
  \ booked. And it is going to be EPIC. \n\n* I wrote this story today on my train\
  \ trip home from work, but I have great potential."
