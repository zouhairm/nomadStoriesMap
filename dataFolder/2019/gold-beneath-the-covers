Text: "A huge, dark map with only a tiny fraction illuminated, with short fragments\
  \ of roads stretching not far out from it. That's how I've always visualized my\
  \ experience of the world, with most of it unknown, uncertain. I wondered how much\
  \ of it could be real, if my paved roads only covered so little. \nUntil recently,\
  \ although I major in Spanish language and culture, I had no clear image of what\
  \ Spain is. Between the historical knowledge of war and religious conflicts, decadence\
  \ and fascism, and the touristic bloom that created an image of the country based\
  \ upon cliched symbols: bull, sangria, Catholicism and flamenco, I couldn't make\
  \ out what it actually is today. All of that didn't make for a real place, nothing\
  \ palpable. It was just another dark patch on the map. And so I came to Spain to\
  \ study for a semester. It still felt like the edge of my map, the stretch of meek\
  \ fields around Castilla could be siblings to my aunt's village in \u0160umadija.\
  \ It wasn't right, I thought, the world had to be made of mutually different places,\
  \ with unique souls. So I took off for the south, in a car-sharing ride that would\
  \ give my parents a stroke. And so along came Seville. \nNow, this one first takes\
  \ you by the lungs. October, and the calendar in general, make Andalusia laugh.\
  \ And laugh it does, wholeheartedly, through its 25 degrees and air so saturated\
  \ with moisture it gets hard to breathe, like walking inside a dense cloud even\
  \ though the sky is as blue as it gets - and I have a taste for contradictions.\
  \ Like watercolors diluting on the wet paper, the heavy air absorbs the surroundings:\
  \ chestnuts grilling, the bells of the enormous cathedral, crowds of tourists exclaiming,\
  \ the smell of anise. If I hadn't breathed it in, I would say the description is\
  \ too literary; alas, save for my word, I can't give other proof that it towers\
  \ upon you with its very air as soon as you set foot in it. Realistically speaking,\
  \ nothing less is to be expected of the old capital of glory that has carried upon\
  \ it the golden age of the Spanish empire (as well as its actual gold, however blood-stained),\
  \ but to break out its perfume like an old lady reliving the days of her youth.\
  \ And smell is the sensation the causes most impression. \nHowever, it's not just\
  \ make-up. Somehow, across the magnificent squares and towers, the history lingers\
  \ still. Its arms of architecture still lie open to the river that used to send\
  \ out ships to the New World, awating. Time hasn't stopped, as modern buildings\
  \ show, it just never really left this city. You can see it in the people that,\
  \ just as pressured by the economical crisis, unemployment and rising political\
  \ issues as in the rest of Spain, seem at once solemn and without a care in the\
  \ world. Because the ease and the glory of its former life still walk the cobble\
  \ streets here, have pints at bars and discuss politics. The pride and honor live\
  \ alongside the meekness of horrors seen, the endurance of wars lost and throne\
  \ taken away, the imposing emptiness and lack of grandness of the world. This is\
  \ the one place that should be the incarnation of everything I thought Spain wasn't:\
  \ with the greatest Gothic cathedral in the world and nocturnal religious processions\
  \ loud, joyous and lively like Christ is about to return any minute (while the rest\
  \ of the country rarely ever visits church), with its golden history standing firm\
  \ at every corner like it doesn't know what day it is (calendars, again), with guitars\
  \ and coplas echoing the streets, it's a touristic pillar. And yet, at the same\
  \ time, it felt the realest of anything I've seen, the firmest and the most alive,\
  \ untethered in space and time yet anchored heavily by them. A beating heart. So,\
  \ it pays to be careful with cliches, sometimes they're what makes up the world.\n\
  As for the map, it didn't grow as much, but this time it wasn't about the quantity\
  \ of the world exposed, but the sensation that it is actually there."
