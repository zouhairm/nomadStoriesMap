Text: "Everyone travels and comes out with a story. Mine will be knowing the unknown.\
  \ Go beyond the documentaries, histories and see this world for myself, see what\
  \ stories I\u2019ll come back with. Over the diner, I\u2019ll debate about what\
  \ is more unique? What is new? And what has not been told?\nFor some, the idea of\
  \ pushing my body to its absolute extreme, reaching the point of exhaustion and\
  \ pushing on further, while battling with every element and the threat of altitude\
  \ sickness, isn\u2019t number one on the list. Well, for pushing myself through\
  \ that torture, I can tell you that it will be absolutely, one hundred percent worth\
  \ it. The journey will take me from rainforest right up to glaciers and snow, the\
  \ beauty is unrivalled, the sunrises impossible to capture on a camera.\nThis year,\
  \ I will be walking through a mix of informative and interesting facts about Portugal.\
  \ From the airport to city, from the backstreets to countryside, from the hotels\
  \ to shanties, from the valleys and to mountains through unimaginable landscape,\
  \ diverse culture and histories of Portuguese. A country where the first thing that\
  \ comes to mind when people hear the name: the oldest state on the Iberian Peninsula\
  \ and one of the oldest European nation-states, having been continuously settled,\
  \ invaded and fought over since prehistoric times. \nI am not headed to see the\
  \ historic towns as most people visiting Portugal would purely do for tourism. \
  \ I have read about Portugal as a top spot for surfing due to the Atlantic breakers,\
  \ and almost all surfing world records have been set there, Portugal as most powerful\
  \ maritime nations during the 15th and 16th centuries, a style of music in Portugal\
  \ called Fado (Fate in Portuguese) has been classified by UNESCO under cultural\
  \ Heritage, Tempura style of cooking was invented by the Portuguese and they introduced\
  \ it to the Japanese, consumption of fish is the third highest in the world, coming\
  \ after Japan and Iceland. With its Mediterranean climate, stunning coastline, fascinating\
  \ history and rich culture, Portugal is a hugely popular tourist destination, drawing\
  \ visitors from all over Europe and the world. It is most famous for its Algarve\
  \ region, where Marinha Beach in Lagoa is ranked as one of the 10 most beautiful\
  \ beaches in Europe (and one of the 100 most beautiful beaches in the world). Given\
  \ its long history, Portugal's architecture has been influenced by many different\
  \ civilizations, and much remains to be seen throughout the country. Capital city\
  \ Lisbon is one of the oldest cities in the world (predating London, Paris and even\
  \ Rome), and is home to a variety of architectural styles including Romanesque,\
  \ Gothic, Manueline, Baroque, Modern and Postmodern. My story is focused in knowing\
  \ the unknown, determining the present and setting pace for the Portuguese future.\
  \ It\u2019s an adventure, to document new findings, an adventure to tell a new story,\
  \ an adventure to inform and educate. And that will be my story."
