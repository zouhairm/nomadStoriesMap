Text: "Colors, sounds, rhythm, smells, tastes, sensations, happiness, smiles, peace:\
  \ I use those words related to feelings and senses to describe my trip to the Brazilian\
  \ northeast, specifically to the state of Pernambuco. On February 3, 2015, four\
  \ days before Carnival, I landed in Recife, capital of the state, identified as\
  \ the cradle of the biggest popular party in Brazil in the seventeenth century,\
  \ the carnival. Today, the city receives thousands of tourists during the Carnival\
  \ festivities and, in addition, has paradisiacal places, both on the coast and in\
  \ the urban area. The Portuguese name Recife means reef, an incredible and diverse\
  \ aquatic ecosystem, where many colors and sounds blend with aquatic life. After\
  \ my extraordinary experience, I concluded that the city has the right name: Recife\
  \ is also a mix of everything, including colors, sounds and organisms, as well as\
  \ a reef. At the airport, it was possible to feel the vibration of the place: colorful\
  \ parasols, which are carried by frevo dancers, decorated the entire arrival terminal\
  \ of the international airport. Today, frevo, a Brazilian folk dance, is included\
  \ in the Representative List of Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity by the\
  \ United Nations (UNESCO). Before Carnival, I met some of the most beautiful landscapes\
  \ I have ever seen. The first point of the trip was Porto de Galinhas, a beach with\
  \ white sand, mangroves and natural pools formed by corals. In that place, the taste\
  \ of cold coconut water mixed with the heat of the sun provided me an indescribable\
  \ sensation.  I swan in a calm sea, where it was possible to see fishes and other\
  \ animals from marine life in transparent water. The second point was Carneiros\
  \ beach with a scenery of incomparable beauty. Carneiros beach is remembered for\
  \ the large expanse of sand and tall coconut trees, the sound of the wind passing\
  \ between the leaves of those trees and the smell of sand and salt from the ocean.\
  \ As soon as the Carnival festivities began, I returned to Recife to live one of\
  \ the largest Brazilian spectacles. The vibe of the city was incredible, streets\
  \ adorned, different songs playing, people smiling, singing and dancing, concerts:\
  \ a true spectacle. In Pernambuco, I tried to absorb everything I could with all\
  \ my senses: the sounds of the concerts, the innumerable colors of fantasies and\
  \ decorations, the taste of typical Brazilian foods. In Olinda, among hills, I could\
  \ see the blue sea and feel the breeze that refreshed the revelers. In Recife, I\
  \ saw famous attractions on stage and I heard music of all rhythms. Recife and Olinda,\
  \ although being different cities, both are mixed together in a great party. This\
  \ experience made me reflect what we often forget in everyday life: the joy of living,\
  \ the gift of smiling and being happy with simple things. The energy, the colors,\
  \ the tastes, the sounds, the smell of food mixed with the sea breeze, in the middle\
  \ of so many people and, curiously, on the streets, I saw that we do not need many\
  \ things to be happy, to feel good. Finally, when I was taking off from the Recife\
  \ International Airport, I concluded that happiness lives in simple situations,\
  \ colors are capable of changing our mood and nature is capable of calm our mind\
  \ and heart, literally. I arrived in S\xE3o Paulo feeling \"saudades\"; this word\
  \ in Portuguese gives a name to a feeling caused by the distance or absence of something\
  \ or someone. Saudade means the memory of something that happened and intense desire\
  \ to relive certain moments. And that's how I feel when I remember the days I spent\
  \ in the Brazilian northeast: hoping to return someday. At\xE9 logo, Pernambuco."
