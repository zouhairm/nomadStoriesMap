Text: "I was in the middle of tying my shoe lace when she approached me. Her beauty\
  \ was astounding that it felt like the time was freezing. Her name was Mina \u2013\
  \ an orangutan living with her babies in the wilderness of Bukit Lawang in North\
  \ Sumatra province of Indonesia.\n\nEcstatic to see orangutan for the first time\
  \ in my life, I foolishly asked for her hand like how a dog owner would ask their\
  \ dog. Mina was an intelligent beast, she understood the gesture and she shook my\
  \ hand in respond. Her grip was gentle, as if she knew I would end up in the hospital\
  \ if she grasped my hand with all her might. I was about to pet her when out of\
  \ nowhere a banana flew past us, distracting Mina from me. It was my guide, pulling\
  \ my arm he commanded, \u201CRun!\u201D\n\nAfter making sure we were far enough,\
  \ he stopped and took a breather. \u201CWhat\u2019re you doing!?\u201D\n\nClueless,\
  \ I asked back naively, \u201Cwhat\u2019s the big deal?\u201D\n\n\u201CThat\u2019\
  s Mina! I\u2019ve told you to quietly run away from her if you spotted her, no?\u201D\
  \n\nHe did. I was shown a video and pictures and was warned to avoid her. But let\u2019\
  s be realistic, it\u2019s my first time meeting an orangutan, how was I supposed\
  \ to tell them apart? Moreover, from what I\u2019ve heard, Orangutan rarely exhibit\
  \ aggression, so why should we run from them?\n\nMy guide sighed, \u201Cyou probably\
  \ read somewhere that Orangutans are friendly, but Mina is different.\u201D\n\n\u201C\
  She looks smart to me though?\u201D\n\n\u201CShe is,\u201D he nodded in agreement,\
  \ \u201Ctoo smart I would say.\u201D\n\nI didn\u2019t understand what he meant,\
  \ however, soon enough I learned the reason why Mina is labelled as a dangerous\
  \ animal. In fact, she\u2019s notorious for her behavior.\n\nAs an infant, Mina\
  \ witnessed her mother\u2019s slaughter and was kept as a pet for three years before\
  \ rescued and brought to the sanctuary. To crown it all, a guide once made fun of\
  \ her in an attempt to impress some women, apparently, Mina did not find it funny\
  \ and almost choke him to death. Later, equipped with a machete and killing intention,\
  \ that guide hunted her for 3 days 3 nights. Thank God for creating such a clever\
  \ girl, Mina was never caught by that evil being. Maybe, it\u2019s her wit telling\
  \ her to never trust a human after those awful experiences.\n\nAfter hearing her\
  \ story, I couldn\u2019t help but felt ashamed for treating her like an attraction.\
  \ My gaze fell to my right hand, still feeling the warmth of her rough palm. It\u2019\
  s hard to believe that behind her beautiful pair of light brown eyes, she was hiding\
  \ such a heart wrenching story. Perhaps, it wasn\u2019t hidden at all. Perhaps,\
  \ it was me who refused to see the obvious.\n\n\u201CShe\u2019s watching us,\u201D\
  \ my guide notified me, pointing to Mina who was hanging in a tree too far and too\
  \ high to discern, \u201Cwatch your back in case she follow us.\u201D\n\nWe moved\
  \ away. I looked back now and then as instructed, but I never see Mina again."
