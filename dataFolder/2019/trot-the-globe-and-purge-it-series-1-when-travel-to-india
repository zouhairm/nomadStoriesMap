Text: "I  heard  mountains.  There  was  a  Mountain\u2014angry  on  humans  for \
  \ we  tear  them;  mount  on  them;  utilize  them  for  our  needs.  Mountain \
  \ did  not  like  it.  It  was  angry  as  if  asking\u2014\u2018do  we  alter \
  \ you  humans  as  per  our  will\u2019\nMountain  hinted  that  it  would  teach\
  \  a  good  lesson  to  humans  on  its  turn.  That  mountain  actually  scared\
  \  me.  The  other  day  I  saw  another  mountain.  Among  many  mountains  it\
  \  was  the  most  innocent  one.  There  were  other  mountains  too,  they  all\
  \  had  complaining  look  but  there  was  this  perfect  green,  perfectly  round\
  \  mountain.  It  was  kind;  not  complaining  rather  it  had  given  space  to\
  \  monkeys  in  his  belly.\nYou  could  see  all  such  mountains  of  weird  expressions\
  \  when  travelling  to  Uttrakhand  region  of  India.  The  land  of  Ganges;\
  \  spiritual  and  holistic  as  its base.  Rich  with  heritage  and  culture.\
  \  Diversity  of  food;  attires;  lingo  and  everything  else  that  could  make\
  \  you  sojourn  here  over  and  over  again.\nJune  comes  with  heat  that  scorches\
  \  skin.  Summers  are  always  cruel  in  Delhi  alike  winters.  Yet  crowd  and\
  \  traffic  never  dwindle  on  roads.  Everyday  people  rushes  from  one  place\
  \  to  another  irrespective  of  weather. \nI  also  had  a  day  in  milieu  of\
  \  art  and  culture.  When  visit  Craft  Museum  Delhi.  From  a  short  narrow,\
  \  slightly  dark  passage  you\u2019d  welcome  by  primeval  effigies  of  warrior\
  \  era.  On  the  left  you  will  find  gallery  of  art  pieces  and  books  adjacent\
  \  to  caf\xE9  Lota.\nWalk  past  that  you\u2019ll  see  wall  painted  with \
  \ royal  elephants  fighting  and  horses  behind  them  with  marquise  and  royalties\
  \  perch  on  them.  Take  right  to  explore  more  of  museum  first  gallery\
  \  you\u2019ll  see\u2014Bhuta  Sculpture.  These  are  the   sculpture  of  Shiva\u2019\
  s  Ganas  originated  three  hundred  years  ago  to  cast  away  evils  like-drought,\
  \  flood  and  other  calamities  from  villages  in  southern  region  of  India.\
  \   Although  they  are  deities  but  you  may  not  get  that  shrine  worshiping\
  \  aura  there. \nTaking  pictures  is  allowed  inside  any  gallery  of  the \
  \ museum  with  prior  permission  only.  You\u2019ll  not  get  any  cicerone \
  \ to  entertain  you  with  galore  of  interesting  knowledge  about  backdrops\
  \  of  mesmerizing  art  and  culture  of  this  nation.  You\u2019ve  to  excavate\
  \  that  on  your  own  if  you  really  have  gland  that  effuse  affection  for\
  \  art.    Nonetheless  you  may  find  one  official  of  the  museum  in  each\
  \  gallery.  Each  gallery  has  wall  rendering  information  about   what  has\
  \  exhibited.  Past  the  gallery  of  Bhuta  sculpture,  through  the  thatched\
  \  corridor  and  quadrangle  of  purple  leaves   you\u2019d  see  Audio  Visual\
  \  Room.  They  will  run  a  short  movie  of  endeavor  on  exploration of  splendid\
  \  art  form  of  this  country.    Movie  reveals  that  how  enrich  this  country\
  \  is  with  beatific  art  forms  that  are  created  by  village  people  at \
  \ faraway  regions.\nThose  meagre  art  creating  people  may  not  know  how \
  \ to  pose  intellectual  with  glass  of  drink  in  exuberant  galleries.  But\
  \  they  certainly  know  that  they  have  to  continue  making  art  form  in\
  \  order  to  keep  them  alive  for  generations  to  come.  However  their  livelihood\
  \  isn\u2019t  implicitly  dependent  on  it  cause  making  of  art  that  gives\
  \  them  puny.  Nor  they  know  to  how  market  their  art  at  large  scale \
  \ to  make  plenty  out  of  it.  That  art  form  was  Ponchu  Cups  although \
  \ not  at  the  display  in  the  museum.\n\u2026\nDoors  of  engraved   art  tells\
  \  you  that  heritage  belongs  to  those  who  had  exert  their  talent  in \
  \ tactile  art  forms.  Wooden  Chariot  is  from  Maharashtra.  It  is  ceremonial\
  \  chariot  of  Lord  Rama  used  for  holy  processions;  pulled  by  devotees\
  \  with  tied  ropes  in  iron  rings  on  the  front  and  back  of  it.  One \
  \ could  see  canopy  of  carved  deities   from  all  four  sides  of  it.\nVillage\
  \  milieu  imparts  serenity   that\u2019s  not  there  in  resplendently  decorative\
  \  lounges.  It  depicts  how  people  in  villages  live  simple  and  plain  life.\
  \ Giant  Pot  could  serve  whole  village.   Mud  houses  of  thatched  roofs.\
  \  Closely  built  houses  also  tells  that  people  in  Villages  live  relatively\
  \  close  alike  the  people  in  towns.\nGandhi  said  \u2018India  lives  in \
  \ villages\u2019.  Sure  it  does  for  major  part  of  their  population  dwells\
  \  on  rural  lands.  Such  lands--imbue  with  rich  heritage  culture--lay  faraway.\
  \  But  one  could  view  all  that:  Village  Life;  Vivid  and  varied  cultures;\
  \  Plethora  of  Art  forms  of  India  at  Craft  Museum  Delhi."
