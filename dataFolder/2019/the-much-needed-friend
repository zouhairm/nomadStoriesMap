Text: "Every new place, situation, hurdle, we encounter while traveling introduces\
  \ us to a new person within us. I had always been a type of person who seeks help\
  \ from inner self than from external sources. It was one of those times where my\
  \ self-esteem was very low. Life was full of questions, confusions, insecurities,\
  \ and problems. I decided I should travel to a new place hoping to find a new person\
  \ within me who can probably help me deal with my problems, or motivate me to solve\
  \ them.\nWhen I decided to travel, the first place that came to my mind was \u201C\
  puri\u201D.  \u201CPuri\u201D is a temple city in the state of Odisha of India.\
  \ It is famous for the Jagannatha temple. The city is filled with spiritual aura\
  \ with the chanting of Vedas in various ancient temples. The beaches in this city\
  \ are few of the cleanest in India. The cool breeze of the sea and refreshing sunrises\
  \ enriches the serenity of the place.\nReached puri city early in the morning. The\
  \ Bay of Bengal welcomed me with the pleasant gold tinted waters formed due to the\
  \ reflection of the refreshing early morning sunrays. Checked into the hotel and\
  \ got ready to explore the city. While relishing the experiences of the new place,\
  \ deep down the insecurities, problems I tried to run away from, kept poking me.\
  \ I was yet to meet the friend I need.\nIt was almost evening. On the way back to\
  \ the hotel, towards my right was a rusty signboard with letters barely visible\
  \ on it. After some struggle, I could read the name on it as Samuka beach. The name\
  \ which I have never heard before, nor did I see in any of the million itineraries\
  \ available online.  I instantly turned the bike, pulled the throttle, and rushed\
  \ towards the beach.\nAs soon as I reached, I had a look around the beach. I kept\
  \ silent and even the voices inside me kept silent. The waves were so fierce that\
  \ it appeared to me as a collection of hungry sharks trying to catch an invisible\
  \ prey. I stood silent, alarmed and astonished by the sight. I couldn\u2019t move\
  \ towards the sea. Some strange fear was stopping me. Maybe the hungry sharks I\
  \ was visualizing were my insecurities and problems I need to address in life. \n\
  While I stood still, gazing at the fierce waves. I was distracted by something.\
  \ After staring for a moment, I realized it was a fisherman with a fishing net in\
  \ his hands. As he reached closer, I got confused. Because I couldn\u2019t see any\
  \ boat nearby to think that he was heading to fish. I couldn\u2019t see any fish\
  \ with him to think he was back from fishing. While I stood there staring at him\
  \ with curiosity, he leaped onto the fierce waves. The hungry sharks I have been\
  \ afraid of, didn\u2019t seem to affect him. After running into the waves, he unfolded\
  \ his bright yellow net and threw onto the waves as if trying to catch hold the\
  \ group of sharks and tame them. \nSeriously!? Fishing on the beach with a fishing\
  \ net!!? He seemed foolish to me. But I was curious about the new practice which\
  \ I have never seen nor heard in my entire life. The only support he has against\
  \ fierce sea was his muscle power he attained due to continuous hard work and the\
  \ will power he gained due to his life experience and the determination to succeed.\
  \ He moved around so tirelessly on the waves. Slowly the fierce waves no more seemed\
  \ like hungry sharks. They seemed like joyful dolphins. Finally, he succeeded. He\
  \ got a meal for the night and I got a lesson for life.\nYes, he was my hero of\
  \ the day. He introduced me to the fighter within me. He showed me that the problems\
  \ are not hungry sharks to run away from but playful dolphins to play with. When\
  \ I go through any hurdles in my life, I remember the fisherman and that beautiful\
  \ evening which helps me deal with them. Traveling never seize to surprise me with\
  \ amazing and motivational experiences like these."
