Text: "I have always been fond of historical monuments and archaeological sites and\
  \ any journey that provides me with an opportunity to visit such sites turns out\
  \ to be a real treat for me. When I paid a visit to my sister in Surat last month\
  \ along with my family to have some respite from the shivering cold of Delhi as\
  \ my sons had winter vacation, I decided to take out some time and travel to Ahmadabad\
  \ as there was nothing left for me in Surat which I had already explored in my previous\
  \ trips.\nOn 7th Jan, at around 11 PM we rode a luxurious bus bound to Ahmadabad\
  \ and soon dozed off as this bus has comfortable cabins best suited for an overnight\
  \ journey. We reached early morning and dropped by one of our uncles who is settled\
  \ there. I had already surfed the net for quite some time looking for the most important\
  \ historical sites that I should visit and Sabarmati Ashram where the father of\
  \ our nation lived topped the list. \nSabarmati Ashram is a quiet and peaceful place\
  \ on the banks of the river Sabarmati. When you enter this Ashram, you will find\
  \ on your left a beautifully designed one story museum building comprised of four\
  \ interconnected halls which showcase important events of Gandhi Ji\u2019s life\
  \ in Ahmadabad spanning over one and a half decade (1915-1930) through hand drawn\
  \ panels and Gandhi Ji\u2019s message by chronicling his life through hundreds of\
  \ photographs based on the theme of Gandhi Ji\u2019s popular saying \u201C\u201C\
  My Life is my Message\u201D. When you come out of the museum, you will find in front\
  \ of you a number of small buildings of historical importance like Hriday Kunj,\
  \ Udyog Mandir, Upasana Mandir etc. Hriday Kund was Mahatma Gandhi\u2019s home in\
  \ this Ashram where he lived with his wife Kasturba from 1918 to 1930. In it you\
  \ can see replicas and some originals, including Gandhiji\u2019s Charkha and Writing\
  \ Desks. On its door I found a lady with Charkha showcasing how it was actually\
  \ used to spin dhaga.\nFrom here I headed to Bhadra but first visited the Sidi Saiyyed\
  \ Mosque, a 16th century heritage site popularly known for its ten intricately carved\
  \ stone latticework windows on the side and rear arches.  After spending some time\
  \ there, Walked on foot to Bhadra Fort while doing window shopping of the alley\
  \ shops. It was built by Ahmad Shah I, the founder of Ahmadabad in 1411. With its\
  \ well carved royal palaces, mosques, gates and open spaces however I found only\
  \ a small splinter of it is left now. \nI walked towards Teen Darwaza which is a\
  \ historical gateway on the east of Bhadra fort. The way between Bhadra Palace and\
  \ Teen Darwaza is a cheap and massive place, and I found it noisy, busy and tight\
  \ squeezed like Chandni Chowk, you can buy here everything of anything. The sellers\
  \ here adopt different ways to attract customers and sometimes make you laugh. I\
  \ think, after all the mess found here, one will not repent visiting this site.\
  \ Walked forward on the same road around 300 meters and reached the Jama Masjid\
  \ of Ahmadabad. This is an iconic yellow-sandstone mosque built in 1424 by sultan\
  \ Ahmed Shah I, whose tomb lies nearby. Here my phone had ran out of battery but\
  \ the beauty of the mosque was such that I could not resist the urge to be clicked\
  \ and after wondering for sometime asked one of the visitors to click some photos\
  \ for me and then send to my whats-app no. He obliged, clicked my photos and took\
  \ my phone no. but unfortunately he never sent the photos.\nI visited the tomb of\
  \ Ahmed Shah which lies beside the mosque and then the tomb of his queens a little\
  \ bit away. The latter is in dilapidated condition and has been largely encroached\
  \ by the locals. It was getting dark and my phone was switched off, so considering\
  \ that my family might be worried about me, took an auto to my uncle\u2019s place\
  \ and in the night left for Surat."
