Text: "\u201C I dare you to come with us on this journey. So what say ?\u201D \u2013\
  \ These were the exact words that sent a chill down my spine  that too on a very\
  \ hot and humid August afternoon. It came from my uncle who had this winning \u201C\
  devilish\u201D grin on his face , he wanted to take or rather \u201Cdrag\u201D me\
  \ along to the Holy City  of Mayapur - situated on the banks of the river Ganga.\
  \ It is regarded as one of the pioneer destinations for Hindu pilgrims, where millions\
  \ flock every year to pay homage to Lord Krishna. The headquarters of the ISKCON\
  \ is also located here and it is also the birthplace of Chaitanya Mahaprabhu (considered\
  \ to be the greatest devotee of Krishna). Now you might want to know why would something\
  \ so normal about accompanying someone on a trip get me all worked up - it\u2019\
  s because I am an ATHEIST.  \n   And like all atheists I honestly find no pleasure,\
  \ in visiting places that have anything to do with God, but now here I was completely\
  \ cornered by my uncle. How could a simple game of truth or dare land me in this\
  \ predicament, is something that I will keep on comprehending for the rest of my\
  \ life. My heart and mind really wanted to say no at this point in time, but after\
  \ all the bragging I did before, like how I never back down from a challenge , how\
  \ I was the self proclaimed \u201CKing of Dares\u201D this would have been a massive\
  \ letdown on my part. I could feel ten pairs of eyes on me waiting eagerly for my\
  \ answer and after staring blankly into nothingness for what felt like an eternity;\
  \ I nodded my head in silent approval. I knew I was walking into unfamiliar territory\
  \ , something I chose to distance myself from but I couldn't. Definitely not now,\
  \ when my bravado is at stake.\n         We (My uncle, Shubho and I) boarded the\
  \ local morning train from Howrah Junction at around 9:00 am and reached Nabadwip\
  \ Dham station at around midday. From there we took a rickshaw to reach Mayapur\
  \ Ghat , followed by a short boat ride which took us across the Ganges right into\
  \ Hular Ghat in Mayapur. As soon as we got off the voice of the Vaishnavas reached\
  \ my ears chanting their sacred, \u201CHare Krishna\u201D mantras. We slowly started\
  \ walking towards the main Chandrodaya Temple amidst the many devotees who had probably\
  \ traveled miles to get a glimpse of their beloved God. I could see small stalls\
  \ on both sides of the road selling handcraft goods, sanitary products, toys, kitchen\
  \ utensils and refreshments. But none of these could compete against the popularity\
  \ of Lord Krishna himself. He was the star of the show and was basically running\
  \ the place. He was everywhere: from cut out pictures, to photo frames, to calendars,\
  \ to diaries, to cups, mugs; you name it and he was there and everyone wanted to\
  \ take him along. \u201CDelusional\u201D, I thought to myself as I observed these\
  \ frantic people. \n  We arrived at the front gates of the temple and walked straight\
  \ in through the arched doorway into the lush lawns of the ISKCON premises. Now\
  \ the inside was a city in its own right.  Acres and acres of land, housing various\
  \ buildings including the towering Temple of the Vedic Planetarium which stood \
  \ at 113 m with its massive blue dome kissing the sky. Apart from this the Brahmachari\
  \ Ashram, the ISKCON Vaishnav Samadhi, Gada Bhavan and ISKCON Puspasamadhi Temple\
  \ were some of the other places of interest. I was quite surprised to find a pizzeria\
  \ there called Vrinda\u2019s. The entire ISKCON compound was fully vegetarian and\
  \ no alcohol consumption was allowed anywhere on the property.\n  Later that day\
  \ I found myself pacing the white marble staircase of the main temple as my companions\
  \ were  appreciating the larger than life Radha Madhava deities inside. \u201CDon\u2019\
  t you want to go in\u201D ? said a kind elderly voice in his saffron attire on my\
  \ right. \u201C I don\u2019t have any other choice\u201D, I shrugged  giving him\
  \ a wry smile as I walked towards the large ornate doors. \u201C Over here, you\
  \ always do\u201D, said the soothing voice behind me."
