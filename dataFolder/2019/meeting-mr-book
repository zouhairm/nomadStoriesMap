Text: "Tuk-tuks rattled by us as we wandered the cracked pathway, devoured by time\
  \ and neglect. The child monks walked slowly by, eyeing us with naive curiosity\
  \ despite looking wiser than their youth, rocking shaved heads and identical robes.\
  \ Locals spat crimson mouthfuls of betel nut tobacco onto the ground, painting the\
  \ sidewalk with even more strange colours and smells. But even with all these peculiar\
  \ sights, it was something more alien that caused my friend and I to marvel. A nondescript\
  \ book stand stood near the gutter and to our delight, the books were in English.\
  \ Since travelling in Myanmar for a few weeks we were yet to find any books in our\
  \ own tongue, and the pages left of our current novels were diminishing rapidly.\
  \ The prospect of new reading material seemed so foreign now and to find it in the\
  \ quiet town of Hsipaw was a pleasant surprise. Tracing the spines with the tips\
  \ of our eager fingers, we were lost in our own world of appreciation until seemingly\
  \ out of nowhere, an older Burmese man materialised next to us. His wrinkled forehead,\
  \ smile lines permanently carved into his cheeks and a toothless smile made me feel\
  \ right at ease. But it was his eyes that contradicted his comforting aura; they\
  \ told of a deeper, more convoluted past.\n\u201COh yes, that is a great book\u201D\
  \ he remarked, nodding towards where my fingers had paused: The Piano Tuner by Daniel\
  \ Mason. \u201CAll books are ten thousand kyat and goes toward a school in the village,\
  \ and you receive special gift from me.\u201D\nI was intrigued by what this gift\
  \ was and why he had concocted such a deal. Was it just a clever sales pitch?\n\
  After perusing the stand a few minutes more, I decided on the Piano Tuner and handed\
  \ him a blue note detailed with intricate red lines. \u201CNow I will show you the\
  \ history of Burma,\u201D he grinned and waddled away, leaving me even more intrigued\
  \ than before.\nI waited five minutes, his plan to build the suspense no doubt,\
  \ before he returned with a plastic sleeve of money and a circular bamboo box. We\
  \ sat down on a plastic stool beside him as he revealed old bank notes, coins and\
  \ pins. He wove us a tale of a different Myanmar, one wrought in political unrest\
  \ and poverty. He explained the superstitious tendencies of many Burmese and how\
  \ all the notes added up to lucky numbers. How once the king demonetised the currency\
  \ with no compensation, wreaking havoc and causing financial turmoil for many people.\
  \ He spoke with great passion about his country and proudly held the pin of the\
  \ democratic party in his palm.\nTraveling is often said to open our eyes to new\
  \ cultures; yet I had been blinded to the atrocities committed in the past as well\
  \ as the very current ones occurring in the outer states of Myanmar. For the first\
  \ time, I realised how little I knew about the country I had come to admire and\
  \ felt a wave of gratitude for books being my connection to this wonderful stranger.\
  \ The very novel I held in my hand had been banned barely a week before. I felt\
  \ criminal, the pages dangerous. But perhaps it would be the start of a new chapter\
  \ in understanding.\nI rose from my seat, feeling lighthearted and educated, and\
  \ shook the hand of my new friend. \n\u201CJust one more question: What is your\
  \ name?\u201D\nHe laughed, a sweet, honeyed sound. \u201CThe man down the road makes\
  \ coffee, he is called Mr. Coffee. The woman next door sells shoes, her name is\
  \ Mrs. Shoes. \u201CAnd me,\u201D He paused. \u201CI am Mr. Book.\u201D"
