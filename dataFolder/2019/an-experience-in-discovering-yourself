Text: "I am scared. I am nervous. As I stand in the middle this enormous crowd hustling\
  \ past me, I hear nothing but my heartbeat. I close my eyes and tell myself, \"\
  You can do this!\" I take a deep breath and pick up my bags. I am at the Rome airport.\
  \  \n\nI have travelled before with family and friends. Although I have always had\
  \ the urge to explore a new country alone. Many travelers quote that a travel experience\
  \ changes you as a person, I wanted to experience that too. This was my first visit\
  \ to a different continent. Europe is definately a lot different than Asia. \n\n\
  I reached Rome and instantaneously fell in love with it. I never thought before\
  \ that one can fall in love with a city. The fragnance, the auro of the city is\
  \ ineffable. The entire city is beautiful, unlike a tourist place where you visit\
  \ certain places within a city, this city was an art museum in itself. Being an\
  \ art, culture and history lover, I instantly knew that my decision to visit this\
  \ place was correct. It was my first time out in a new city and like any other traveler\
  \ I had planned my entire trip and destinations to visit. But instead, I found myself\
  \ wandering in the streets of Rome, then Florence and Venice. \n\nOne day as I was\
  \ sitting on the Spanish Steps in Rome, watching over the great amalgamation of\
  \ people around. There were tourists who were trying their best to get a good selfie\
  \ clicked at the spot, kids playing around, and locals moving on with their daily\
  \ work. I met a person from one of the neighbouring countries of India. I was amazed\
  \ by the friendly behaviour by which he greeted me. Back at home, this might not\
  \ be a very common scenario. I was extremely happy to understand the fact that the\
  \ borders of your country tend to melt away when you are no longer inside it. \n\
  \nAnd wait! I was in Italy! How am I not talking about the food? Well, I think that\
  \ food is the most interesting and important thing which can happen to you in a\
  \ day. I have been a fan of Pizza and Pasta since I was a kid. However, I had no\
  \ idea that the flavor is going to change on crossing the borders. I went in to\
  \ the local shops for food and I found a complete new defination of Pasta!\n\nMeeting\
  \ people who speak completely different language and living a complete different\
  \ lifestyle, I have realised that travel does changes people. I got to pop my own\
  \ bubble and step out to all the possibilities. I stopped judging people and started\
  \ to try to understand their lives. I stopped being scared and started being more\
  \ open to the unknowns. \n\nSince then I have made a decision to travel outside\
  \ my city atleast once in a few months. Because only trees stay at one place, right?\
  \ Now I have one word for you if you say \"travel?\". \"Yes!\""
