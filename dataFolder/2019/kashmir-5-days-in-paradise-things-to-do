Text: "Sitting at the airport, waiting to board my flight to\_Srinagar\_.I write this\
  \ thinking to myself how the next 20 days of my life are going to be.\nMy first\
  \ solo Indian trip with a bunch of complete strangers from around the globe, I feel\
  \ a sense of anxiety and excitement in me.\nFirst Stop:Srinagar\n\nMy first view\
  \ of this beautiful city was of red brick houses & buildings, traffic jams and the\
  \ beautiful Dal lake.\_We had our first dinner at the famous Mughal\_Darbar. The\
  \ Kashmiri \"Wazwan\" a speciality which one must not miss.A great spread of many\
  \ mutton dishes served with a heap of rice, leaves you satisfied and craving for\
  \ more. We took the famous shikara ride(Boat ride) ,a must do while in Srinagar.\
  \ If you can spend a night on the house boat as well,it would be great to catch\
  \ the early\_morning sunrise. The roads have heavy security with the army\_standing\
  \ at every nook & corner. For the first time it leaves anyone quite stunned and\
  \ in anticipation of what lies ahead.\n\nNext Stop: Sonamarg\nThe drive from Srinagar\
  \ to Sonamarg is approximately 2.5-3 hours depending on how many stops you make\
  \ on the way.\nThe drive has some spectacular views of mountain ranges, valleys\
  \ and pretty streams.Pretty glaciers that lie in the Himalayan range can be viewed\
  \ at this beautiful hill station.\nWe drove to a point known as\_Ziro\_point,which\
  \ would normally be filled with snow in the winter.The road to the Ziro point is\
  \ a very narrow rocky terrain.Only local J&K registered vehicles or you're own vehicle\
  \ are allowed over these roads.No other taxi/cab with another states registration\
  \ are allowed.We witnessed some really beautiful sights along the way.\nOne must\
  \ spend a minimum of a night at this gorgeous place.We had some local aloo (Potato\
  \ pancakes)parathas and Kawa(the local kashmiri Chai) as soon as we reached the\
  \ town of Sonamarg.\n\nNext stop: Pahalgam\nPahalgam known as the town of the shepherds\
  \ is famous for its Lidder river\_and Betab valley. ( Would be good options to explore)\n\
  On our drive from Srinagar which is about two hours we stopped by the famous apple\
  \ orchards and the bat factory.\nEn route we stopped at the Lidder River which was\
  \ simply breathtaking.\n\nWe entered the pretty town of Pahalgam with beautiful\
  \ mountains on one side and\_ with a river flowing continuously along the way.\n\
  We reached just in time for some lovely Kashmiri cuisine at Hotel Prince - A must\
  \ visit for non vegetarians. We gorged on some delicious Mutton Kashmiri pulao and\
  \ spicy mutton curry.\nOne evening as we walked down a narrow lane in the hills.A\
  \ lovely family welcomed us into their home.We had the most honest and enriching\_\
  \ conversation..One thing they said that left me speechless and thinking -\n\"People\
  \ all over the country think that Kashmir and its people aren't safe , but it's\
  \ not true even if a woman walks alone at night she will be safe with our people\
  \ in Kashmir ..We really wish Kashmir was not portrayed as some terror zone as the\
  \ media does. \"The family was so humble and simple-we sat there listening to them\
  \ as though we belonged to their home.. At least that's how they made us feel...\n\
  People of Kashmir are some of the nicest I've met in a while..\nIt's definitely\
  \ not as scary or unapproachable as we think it to be or made to believe ..\nEveryone\
  \ must really visit this paradise!!!\nNext stop Gulmarg\nThe drive to Gulmarg was\
  \ something else. The hills had pretty flowers all along the way which made it surreal\n\
  I never expected Kashmir to be this gorgeous.\nSome points to try and keep in mind\
  \ if traveling to Kashmir\n*Kashmir is not dangerous as the media claims it to be.Srinagar\
  \ has a lot of security and military on every nook and corner though.\n*Sonamarg\
  \ ,Pahalgam & Gulmarg to be on your itinerary in this order.\n*Eat local Kashmiri\
  \ food\n*Spend time talking to the Kashmiri locals.They have some great stories\
  \ to tell.\nGo with an open mind and come back feeling happy!\nShruti"
