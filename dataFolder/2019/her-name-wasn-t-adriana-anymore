Text: "Morning flight is always be a home work for me. Have to wake up earlier. Taking\
  \ a shower while your eyes still close. I always arrived at the airport with bad\
  \ mood before making a check in. But not today. Yeah not today. It's been 17 years\
  \ we've never met after graduate from the high school. I'm so excited--And she's\
  \  become a nun now.\n\nWork in the travel industry has a benefit to those who loves\
  \ adventures. The head office might send you to the potential tourism places in\
  \ order to find out what they have to offer. And yes this time they send me to \
  \ Pangkalpinang to the island of Sumatera, Indonesia. I have visited some province\
  \ in Sumatra Island. This one is new for me. Pangkalpinang is the capital and largest\
  \ city of the Indonesian province of the Bangka Belitung Islands. Located on Bangka\
  \ Island's east coast, the city is divided into seven districts and has 42 wards.\n\
  \nAs I always said time schedule for transportation  in Indonesia always a mystery.\
  \ Plus I will be flying with the most  danger airlines in Indonesia \"Lion Air\"\
  .  Who doesn't know this airlines. After waiting for 2 hours , finally we are heading\
  \ to board. They put my seat  in the  emergency window. \"Okay they're sending me\
  \ to jump over the window. \"Calm down J you'll be fine\". I'm debating with my\
  \ self. \n\nThe flight from Jakarta to Pangkalpinang took an hour. But feels like\
  \ forever. After passed those scary turbulence which almost makes me pee on my pants,\
  \  we arrived safely at the white land of Pangkalpinang. From above you can see\
  \ many holes like a lagoon because of used tin excavation. This island had ever\
  \ reach the peak of glory as a biggest tin mining almost two centuries since 1812-1992.\
  \ \nWhen the exit door slide open , the heat of the island come trough my face like\
  \  slapped me in the face and said \"welcome to Pangkalpinang\". It's hot and dried.\
  \ And the white land makes my eyes can't even look further. Taxi's driver offer\
  \ me to drop off but I'm waiting for a call from my friend. I try to call her but\
  \ it seems she's on duty. \n\nAnd after 3 minutes my phone rang. \"Hello brother,\
  \ just walk outside and there is  \"bluebird\" taxi outside. It's only 100 meters\
  \ from exit gate\". I replied \"Oh ... perfect then.\"  then she added \"I'm about\
  \ to go for a next class, please text me when you are coming to visit me\". \n\n\
  I walked down the road for about 200 meters and the exit gate is still more even\
  \ further. \"hmmmm\". Are you playing game with me Adriana.\" \nafter walked for\
  \ 4 minutes I reach the main road. It's only pine trees and there is no taxi. I\
  \ called my hotel and they said that they have send me a guy to pick me up. And\
  \ I said to the hotel to tell the guy that I'm outside already sitting on the top\
  \ of my luggage. \"What you wearing sir?\" the receptionist asked me. \"Oh well\
  \ just tell him coming down because I'm the only person who's here.\" \n\nCheck\
  \ in to the hotel was very easy. They look at my tired face and direct me trough\
  \ my room. I was staying at the most historical hotel in this island. Menumbing\
  \ Heritage Hotel. All white with colonial (dutch) architecture. Then my phone rang\
  \ again. \"Hi brother , I'm really sorry I didn't know that they moved to  the new\
  \ airport already.\" She apologized because maybe she read my message. I do understand.\
  \ She's a nun. \n\nBeautiful sunset set on the west while I'm on my way to the nun\
  \ monastery to visit Adriana. I met their master head of nun. She's asking me with\
  \ a serious face. \"Who's you looking for ?\" I said \"Sister Adriana.\" She's frowned.\
  \ \"I'm the head master here, worked 8 years here and never heard that name.\" then\
  \ she added  \"are you sure?\" ... \"Well I'm going inside to check first\" ...\
  \ \"Yes Sister, thanks.\n\nI didn't know that the nuns after they taking their eternal\
  \ vows , their name changed. And her name wasn't Adriana anymore! Her name is \"\
  Eligia\""
