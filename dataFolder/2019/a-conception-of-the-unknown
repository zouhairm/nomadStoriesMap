Text: "I teetered on a steep patch of dark gravel, exhausted. My body shook and my\
  \ head was light. Noxious fumes filled the air\u2014 sulfur dioxide and ash. My\
  \ legs had been giving out for hours. For every step I took, I slid two steps back.\
  \ I couldn\u2019t tell if my tears were from the wind and the grit that pelted me\
  \ in the face, or from the fear of trudging upwards into fog so dense it was impossible\
  \ to see more than a meter ahead. I started to lose heart.\n\nI was grateful when\
  \ Willy, our guide, plopped down for a rest. He had a t-shirt wrapped around his\
  \ mouth and nose and was laying with his head propped against his backpack, eyes\
  \ closed, at home in this place that was so foreign to me. \n\n\u201CHow much farther\
  \ until we reach the crater?\u201D I shouted over the wind to Alex, another solo\
  \ traveler I\u2019d met only days prior. \n\nOne of Willy\u2019s eyes popped open.\
  \ \u201CWe\u2019re here. This is it. You made it.\u201D\n\n***\nI\u2019d spent the\
  \ previous day riding a motorcycle around the island of Ometepe in Lake Nicaragua,\
  \ maneuvering through herds of cattle and whizzing by banana plantations, catching\
  \ glimpses of Volc\xE1n Concepci\xF3n looming in the distance. Rising from sea level\
  \ to 1,700 meters, Concepci\xF3n dwarfs its companion, Volc\xE1n Maderas, which\
  \ rests quietly at the other end of the island. Clouds rarely cease to cloak Concepci\xF3\
  n\u2019s lonely peak. All day I\u2019d noticed them hovering there, reminding me\
  \ that I couldn\u2019t see where I was going to go. When Alex initially proposed\
  \ doing the climb, I agreed to hike only to the halfway point. \n\n\u201CWho goes\
  \ halfway?\u201D he replied. \n\n***\nI booked a ticket to Nicaragua in late 2018\
  \ on impulse, a means of escape from the anxiety I\u2019d been having over my uncertain\
  \ future. I had visions of myself alone on a beach with a book, watching sunsets\
  \ and recovering from months spent obsessing over graduate school applications.\
  \ Nicaragua seemed an odd choice for someone looking for respite, given the deadly\
  \ political turmoil that rocked the country and nearly decimated its tourism industry\
  \ earlier that year. Too proud to admit that I hadn\u2019t been up on current events\
  \ prior to booking, I decided not to cancel my trip. It was the right decision.\
  \ Nicaragua, even in the throes of political unrest, remains an exquisite country\
  \ filled with gracious, resilient people who are not afraid to embrace change and\
  \ uncertainty in favor of their ideals.\n\nI drew in a breath, incredulous that\
  \ I was balanced on the peak of an active volcano after a five hour climb through\
  \ farmland and jungle and steep meadows. We\u2019d navigated cliffs and ash-flows\
  \ and crevices, and blindly scrambled up a field of loose volcanic rock shrouded\
  \ in thick white fog. Through all of that, I never expected to make it to the top.\n\
  \nAnd yet, there I was. \n\nThe whiteness broke for a moment and I realized that\
  \ it wasn\u2019t fog; I was in the clouds. A strange mix of emotions welled up inside\
  \ me: dread at the thought of the equally challenging descent; gratitude for a fellow\
  \ traveler\u2019s subtle insistence that I not merely go halfway; and appreciation\
  \ for Willy, who shared his own insecurities: \u201CLike most Nicaraguans, I\u2019\
  m living day to day right now,\u201D he\u2019d told us that morning. \u201CThings\
  \ are tough here. No one knows what our future holds.\u201D \n\nMost of all, I cherished\
  \ my acceptance of the discomfort I felt, standing precariously close to the mouth\
  \ of Volc\xE1n Concepci\xF3n, pushed by winds that threatened to sweep me into a\
  \ gaping pit that I could not see but knew was there. \n\nI put my hand on the rim\
  \ of the crater to steady myself. Willy smiled under his makeshift mask. \u201C\
  It\u2019s surprising how far your feet can carry you, one step at a time.\u201D\n\
  \nAnd then I had a thought: everything we face is unknown. Nothing is certain. And,\
  \ if we embrace that discomfort and hold it close, if we cherish it and even nurture\
  \ it, perhaps we\u2019ll be surprised at how far our feet have carried us, straight\
  \ into the unknown, one step at a time."
