Text: "Traveling solo the first time is difficult to do whether it is domestic or\
  \ international but the rewards are innumerable. If you are afraid or not sure,\
  \ it's okay because everyone has an inaugural experience.  \n \nI\u2019ve had a\
  \ passport for 10 years and there isn\u2019t a single stamp! It\u2019s a milestone\
  \ year, and I decided I to visit France. I researched and read everything I could\
  \ about France to decide where to visit. Visiting France is my dream.  \n \nI'm\
  \ determined to immerse myself into the culture, believe that I am French, revel\
  \ in the art, the history, and the architecture. I decide on a barge tour for the\
  \ opportunity to see lush green countrysides, small quaint villages, vineyards,\
  \ bustling local markets, and impressive castles.  \n \nI\u2019m boarding my plane,\
  \ and it is surreal that I\u2019m traveling solo. My head is filled with thoughts\
  \ of excitement and the unknown. Lighting speed images of fears and possibilities\
  \ are flashing through my mind. What if I get lost, and no one speaks English? What\
  \ if I get mugged and lose all my money? Do I know where the US Embassy is located?\
  \  \n \nI settle into my seat. It's hard to comprehend traveling for twelve hours.\
  \ The plane begins to roll forward and prepare for take off. I\u2019m not afraid\
  \ to fly, but my hands are clenched, and suddenly I panic, what if I forgot something!\
  \ I realize of course I can purchase anything I forgot in Paris. Then the plane\
  \ is airborne and there's no turning back. \n \nAfter sleeping for a while, I glance\
  \ at my watch and realize I\u2019m almost to Paris. I look out the window and watch\
  \ the undulating, green, verdant landscape below, and relax for a little while longer.\
  \ Then the plane's engines change speed, the Captain announces to prepare for landing\
  \ in 30 minutes. My stomach starts to flutter and panic returns. Reality is arriving\
  \ quickly, what if they lost my luggage.  \n \nI look out the window trying spot\
  \ the Eiffel tower it's nowhere to be seen. I do see a city that is compacted like\
  \ blocks jammed in a box with weaving, narrow alleyways. The sun is shining; it's\
  \ 11 am. I feel refreshed but with an inner anxiety, I don't understand. I always\
  \ wanted to visit France. It is exciting, why all the apprehension? I thrive on\
  \ doing things new and different. I'm a long way from everything familiar and will\
  \ be surrounded by strangers who speak another language.  \nAs the plane lands,\
  \ I\u2019m suddenly exhilarated and absent from fear. I\u2019m ready for my new\
  \ adventure to commence. I want to experience everything possible. I exit the plane\
  \ with no indecision or fear and proceed to collect my luggage, pass through customs,\
  \ and walk out of Charles de Gaul airport.  \n \nMy eyes and head are spinning trying\
  \ to take in everything. My mind is telling me to see it all, don\u2019t miss a\
  \ thing. It is surreal that I\u2019m really here! I walk confidently to the bus\
  \ stop, board the bus. The French chatter around me accosts my ears, and I realize\
  \ the little French I learned is enough to understand fragments of conversations\
  \ around me. Shockingly, the bus driver understood me when I verified the destination\
  \ of the bus.  \n \nMy trip is one I have never forgotten and often recall many\
  \ of the people I met or places I visited. I\u2019ve traveled solo on many other\
  \ trips, all with wonderful memories and experiences along with comparable fears\
  \ and apprehension.  \n \nIt doesn't matter where you visit, there are unfailingly\
  \ similarities. People may speak a different language, dress uniquely, or their\
  \ culture may seem strange. The reality is we all have kindred fears, dreams, and\
  \ hopes. With a sense of wonder and amazement, I return from an adventure to the\
  \ unfamiliar but always with glorious memories and a new perspective of a country\
  \ and the culture. Don't be afraid to travel alone, the rewards are immense."
