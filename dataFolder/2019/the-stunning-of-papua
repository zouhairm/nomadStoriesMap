Text: "\"Welcome to the Earth of Paradise\". As soon as someone greeted me that morning\
  \ I landed at Sentani Airport, Papua Province. The man was later known as Andre,\
  \ a driver who was assigned from the office to pick me up. \"Hello, Pace (the nickname\
  \ of a man in Papua) Andre. Greetings, \"I replied.\n\nWhen I walked out of the\
  \ airport, I saw the airport is surrounded by mountains, where at this time the\
  \ rain has just stopped so the clouds descend to cover the mountains. The sighting\
  \ of the scene made me forget the feeling of aches over the body after traveling\
  \ around 7 hours from Jakarta to Jayapura, the capital of Papua. Initially before\
  \ this long trip, I was overcome with anxiety. Anxious about Papua, in addition\
  \ to long trips, worrying about turbulence in the middle of the trip, also about\
  \ earthquakes that often hit Papua, extreme events (shootings) by indigenous Papuans\
  \ and dangerous diseases such as malaria which threaten visitor like me. But one\
  \ thing that made me curious was that I had to explore the beauty of Papua.\n\n\
  After all the work was completed for 4 days, I still had half a day before returning\
  \ to Jakarta and I would use it to explore Papua. I contacted Andre and he was willing\
  \ to take me. The first destination is to Bukit Jokowi. \"Why is this place called\
  \ Bukit Jokowi (Jokowi Hill), because every time President Joko Widodo (Jokowi)\
  \ come to Papua, he always takes time to visit this place,\" explained Andre. A\
  \ beautiful place, on a hill, overlooking the Gulf of Youtefa and visible stretch\
  \ of hills. It used to be called Skyline Hill. Also seen is the Holtekamp Bridge\
  \ which will later connect Indonesia and Papua New Guinea.\n\nThen I continued my\
  \ visit to another famous location, namely Lake Sentani. While on the plane, I clearly\
  \ saw this beautiful natural lake. Now I go up to the rocky hill, just for a selfie\
  \ against the background of Sentani\u2019s lake, which is surrounded by hills. Extraordinary.\
  \ Andre then invited me to visit a new location which was unknown to many people,\
  \ namely Bak River. We only know the description of the location, which is not far\
  \ from Sentani Airport or just behind the Papua Bangkit Stadium, the stadium that\
  \ the Papuan government is building to face the National Sports Week 2020. Without\
  \ using Google Maps (because the signal to that location is lost), we only ask it\
  \ goes to the surrounding residents to go to that location. \"Hey Mace (a call to\
  \ women in Papua), where is the location of Kali Bak?\" asked us to two women who\
  \ were walking along the roadside. \"Enter through a small road beside the Papua\
  \ Bangkit Stadium, just follow the path,\" said the two young women while chewing\
  \ betel nuts. Betel nut is a typical Papuan fruit eaten by the majority of indigenous\
  \ Papuans.\n\nFinally, we through a rocky path, and we see a mountain and a forest.\
  \ \"It looks like the location is behind the mountain,\" I said to Andre. And sure\
  \ enough, after going through a little forest and mountains, we arrived at that\
  \ location. It turns out that Kali Bak is a spring that comes down from the mountain\
  \ and makes a small river. The water is very clear and natural. We also tried to\
  \ wash our faces and we felt cold water.\n\nNot long we were in that place, since\
  \ it was late at night, Andre invited me to visit another place, Jayapura City Hill.\
  \ Andre drove the car faster, because he believed me that we had to reach the hill\
  \ before sunset. And 1 hour later we arrived at the hill, which when seen from the\
  \ city of Jayapura read \"Jayapura City\" (like Hollywood writing in Los Angeles)\
  \ and had a large cross statue. It appears from where we stand, the sun will soon\
  \ be set in the Pacific Ocean, sparkling lights from the city of Jayapura and several\
  \ ships that are lowering the load at Yos Sudarso Bay Pier.\n\nAndre just advised\
  \ \"One day you will come here again, leaving one full day. We must visit more beautiful\
  \ places. \"\n\n\"Definitely\" I said."
