Text: "Samara beach lies in the Guanacaste province, forty-five minutes by bus from\
  \ the city of Nicoya, where the local Samare\xF1os go to pay their bills. The route\
  \ to Samara is filled with curves and potholes, one can easily lose themselves in\
  \ the forests that surround the road or be struck by the wildlife which seems to\
  \ play hide and seek with the passing cars. On the beach itself, the energy changes\
  \ into a profound almost trance-like state, with the sound of the ocean mixed with\
  \ the indistinct chatter of people acting as hypnosis. The beach is relaxed the\
  \ majority of the time, only during high season is there enough people to overcrowd\
  \ the magic of the sand. \nDuring high tide, the sea is filled with surfers, surf\
  \ instructors and swimmers all who are looking to feel the waves. But for me, low\
  \ tide is the best time. When the tide is low, the shore is littered with coral\
  \ and shells, and horses; the horses are always free in Samara. And if the tide\
  \ is low enough after work the locals have a mejenga, or a pickup soccer game on\
  \ the beach, playing until the sun sets. My host brother told me about the games\
  \ the first night I arrived. I had to play. I was nowhere near the level as the\
  \ locals. No matter how hard I played it seemed they were always faster and more\
  \ skillful.  But I always found myself smiling, even laughing at times from the\
  \ joy I felt playing in what felt like paradise. My first week in Samara I played\
  \ every day. I would limp home, sore and exhausted covered in sand ready to play\
  \ again.  The locals began to call me Modric after the futbalista, for the resemblance\
  \ and the fact my name is difficult to pronounce in Spanish.  The games were always\
  \ physical and filled with passion and pride.  They always told me \"Mas fuerte\
  \ Modric, M\xE1s fuerte con cuerpo\".They were never afraid to put their bodies\
  \ on the line.  Even the hardest foul was never met with violence, they were all\
  \ brothers on the beach. And in most cases, they were related or had known each\
  \ other their whole life. The cure of living in a town of only 1,500 residents.\
  \ \nWith time I began to feel part of that brotherhood, when walking to the beach\
  \ I was always met with \u201DPura vida Modric, Todo bien?\u201D I didn\u2019t recognize\
  \ everyone who I would talk to, but I would always respond \u201CPura vida mae\u201D\
  \    \n  The hardest part was leaving Samara. My last day I sat on the beach while\
  \ the sun was setting, taking in what I was leaving. The tide was not low enough\
  \ to play, but the locals sat smoking rolled cigarettes watching the sunset. They\
  \ came to me and asked if I had brought my ball; just so we could juggle it a little.\
  \ I told them I had left it at my house. Then I told them that it was my last day,\
  \ and I wouldn't be here to play anymore. They all shook my hand and said goodbye.\
  \ I remember the one who had always played the hardest saying in his accented English\
  \  \u201CIt\u2019s was amazing though wasn\u2019t it Modric? When are you going\
  \ to come back?\u201D."
