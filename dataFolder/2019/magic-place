Text: "Once Friday, august I arrived at Mexico City at six pm alone. I left de airport\
  \ and I actually felt on holidays when I saw de sky, a sunset sky. I had that feelling\
  \ of freedom which invades us only when we are on vacations. It was raining a little,\
  \ but the sparks didn\u2019t bother me, the typical rainning on summer, but never\
  \ too much hot in that city, like winter, not too much cold either. \nIt was my\
  \ second time in the country, and with the same friend, and this one we would just\
  \ spent two days. The last time, I stayed there for almost a week, and I went to\
  \ the classics spot you should see if you go there. We decided to go to coyoacan\
  \ on Saturday, and to Chapultec forest on Sunday. We choose the first one for a\
  \ walk on that neighborhood because of the absence of buildings and the abundance\
  \ of trees. I loved walking and get lost in new places, I loved get lost on my mind\
  \ on those moments. I used to ask me about how my life would be if I lived there,\
  \ I jumped on that fantasy. We went to the Trosky museum, I`d read a book about\
  \ exile and murder, so I was in loved with the idea of been on the same house that\
  \ he lived. The Chapultepec forest was plenty of people, it was Sunday, so a lot\
  \ of familys went there. I confess that I felt a little locale. \nOn Monday we took\
  \ an early fly to Cancun, Yucatan, the final destination was Holbox, a small island\
  \ in front of united states (not in front Europe or Africa like other islands in\
  \ the peninsula).\nHolbox was the paradise on earth. It is an island with a little\
  \ snake form, where there are amazing beaches. The sea invites you to spend hours\
  \ and hours having a loving bath. You have longs walking on the beach to the two\
  \ extremes of the island, where you can find a lot of flamingos enjoying stay there\
  \ with their legs into the short water. Sometime, if you have lucky, you would see\
  \ them flying from one point to the other. Once I had the fortune of shared a sunset\
  \ with a heron in the sea. We were really near, she looked at me several times and,\
  \ until now, I am convinced that she was glad with mi presence too. The sunsets\
  \ there were the best one i\xB4ve ever seen. The purples, reds, and blues in which\
  \ the sky\xB4s going into left me breathless. I loved the places where nature impose\
  \ us all of their magic, I feel like it going through me.\nThe town was beautiful,\
  \ a small grid of ten blocks by ten blocks. There aren\u2019t cars, just \u201C\
  buggys\u201D to take materials from the port to different directions, and also being\
  \ used like taxis. There are a lot of constructions, a lot of hotels and all types\
  \ of places for have tourism. I have still felt a little afraid that too much people\
  \ getting there would damage the place. \nWe made a lot of friends, other persons\
  \ who had been travelling and a lot of persons who worked there, most of them for\
  \ tourism on hostals or restaurants. I always think that relationships which\xB4\
  s born on travels are so much intense. My hypothesis is persons on holydays are\
  \ their best versions, so is easier get connect with each other. I had deep conversation\
  \ whit them about life. We were supposed to stay there for a week, but we canceled\
  \ the next reservation in the new destination, to stayed at Holbox. We couldn\xB4\
  t leave de island, we couldn\xB4t leave our new home."
