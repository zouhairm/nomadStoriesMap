Text: "\"God help me\". I no longer know what you want from me. I am trying to be\
  \ grateful, understanding, humble in my current path that I have set myself out\
  \ on. I am crying on my bed, begging, praying to you for the first time since I\
  \ was a child. How did it get so bad? Why am I being forced to learn this lesson?\
  \ How am I manifesting this negativity into my reality?  Have I not been through\
  \ enough? Have I not been a good person long enough? Everything seems to tumble\
  \ down, no matter what I do, no matter what choice I make. \"God help me\", I took\
  \ a leap into the unknown, having faith in you, the angels and the universe that\
  \ I was making the right choice, the right risk. What kind of lesson can I be learning\
  \ here? I have no money, no job, in danger, in a foreign country being forced to\
  \ hide. I don't care anymore. What is the point of having control of my path, having\
  \ a long term plan, saving money, having money!, if it all sabotages itself? Being\
  \ Always forced to start again, in a lower place then I was before. My chest hurts.\
  \ I cannot breathe. I am choking on my own snot, no number of tissues can save this\
  \ feeling. There's nothing left for me to do, but sit here, and melt into my bed,\
  \ into my pillow, and forget to think, forget to feel, forget the hope that has\
  \ kept me moving with strength before. Forget it all, and be. \nWhen the child fell\
  \ on the floor, my body stiffened up. I felt the hairs on my skin point to the sky,\
  \ and my eyes burn open wide. It's as if I watched a split-second accident last\
  \ 10 minutes of my life. Motion picture, starring me and the Chinese School Mafia.\
  \ I could of never imagined the universe doing me such a favor, in such a way, in\
  \ which was so destructive to my body, mind and spirit. Truly a pinch on the skin,\
  \ in which would wake me up from the illusion I was already aware of living. It's\
  \ hard to believe that what we consider \" the end of the world, our life as we\
  \ know it\" are truly gifts from the heavens.  I knew this was the moment that would\
  \ change what I already saw coming. \n\"We have to put you into hiding, the parents\
  \ of the child that fell in the classroom wants to call the police.  If they succeed\
  \ in such a task, you will be going to jail\", spoken by the words of the school\
  \ owner. These words that burned through my stomach, as if taking 100 punches to\
  \ the gut. I remember shutting off my mind at this moment, and my animal instinct\
  \ kicking in. It was so surreal, in which, I blacked out into a tunnel vision of\
  \ escape. What can I do? This is not my fault? Is this my fault? Do I truly deserve\
  \ to end up this way? I am a good person. Am I a good person? Perhaps, I deserve\
  \ this Karma. Is this another cycle I need to accept and surrender to? How much\
  \ more pain, is needed to uncover hidden in me? I didn't expect to find myself in\
  \ the underworld, here, now, who could have predicted this?\nI went home to find\
  \ myself crying, sobbing, begging to God on the corner of my bed. Sitting in the\
  \ dark, asking my self what is next. I hear knocking at my door. Who could this\
  \ possibly be? No one is coming to save me. I remember the shock I felt when I opened\
  \ my apartment door, to see a familiar face behind it. He had the largest, sincere\
  \ smile on his face, which faded when his eyes look at my snotty, tear face look.\
  \ I was making a local connection with a Spanish man living in China. Demonstration\
  \ of no boundaries, which was comforting and loving. My guardian angel came and\
  \ saved me in the night. He refused to leave me alone that night. Who knew I would\
  \ fall in love at my darkest hour."
