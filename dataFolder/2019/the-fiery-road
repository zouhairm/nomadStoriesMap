Text: "\u201COkay, let\u2019s start the packing\u201D, 25 December, 2010, Dad announced\
  \ a low-budget trip for the whole family to a place called Puri, a sacred city on\
  \ the shore of Bay of Bengal. As a child of 10, I was exhilarated for this kind\
  \ of family trip to happen. We were a family of eleven counting my aunts, uncles\
  \ and my cousins. It was a Saturday afternoon when all the members were discussing\
  \ a picnic plan for the coming New Year\u2019s Eve and then my Dad came up with\
  \ the idea of driving to the Puri beach, the very next day. The only problem was,\
  \ we had just one car which was a grey colored  Maruti Omni, to be precise and only\
  \ my uncle had the registered driving license. \nThe next day, we were ready with\
  \ three to four bags in our drawing room, by five in the morning. Just a green signal,\
  \ we all we were waiting for, to hop into the car and then a drive of 600 km. Half\
  \ an hour passed and there was no news from the men in my family. By six, my dad\
  \ came and asked the five children to capture the dickey, the three ladies in the\
  \ middle seats and the three men in the front. The sound boxes were our seats in\
  \ the dickey. The luggages were somehow kept under the seats and the water bottles\
  \ were with the children. It was an eleven hour ride from our home so my people\
  \ were pretty sure to reach the destination by seven in the evening. \nWe crossed\
  \ Jamshedpur and were heading towards Cuttack via NH16. It was already dark because\
  \ of the winter season and we could see fire on both sides of the road ahead. It\
  \ was a spine-chilling scene for all of us and also baffling enough for our pack\
  \ to deal with the situation, we were into and to decide the next step. As a child,\
  \ I hardly understood the situation. The elders decided to configure someone before\
  \ driving further so we stopped near a tea stall to ask about the fire. He told\
  \ us that a few hours ago, there was a Hindu- Muslim riot in which the villagers\
  \ burnt around twelve trucks which were parked there in order to show the aggression\
  \ from both the sides. The area was under the RAF (Rapid Action Force) control and\
  \ was quite risky to be crossed at that time. \nIt was a hardly ten minute discussion\
  \ on whether to go back home safely or to cross the path leading us for our awaited\
  \ vacation. All eleven of us chose to be a part of the adventure and thus took the\
  \ road with fire alongside. The road was lonely enough and felt like carrying the\
  \ burden of pain. There wasn\u2019t a single individual on our route for the next\
  \ few kilometres and all we could see was the burning trucks. There was even a shortage\
  \ of petrol and the one thing we knew was, not to stop at any cost till we find\
  \ a petrol pump. Somehow, our car stopped near a pump and we all were safe and sound\
  \ with his incredible memory where we understood how we can face any fear together.\
  \ \nIt was around twelve in the night when we reached the Puri city. My father and\
  \ my uncle started searching for hotels but at last we couldn\u2019t find one. Since\
  \ it was an unplanned trip, we ended up in another adventure that I will save for\
  \ some other time.  Till then, thank you for your patient reading."
