Text: "Standing in the arrivals hall in O.R Tambo International Airport in a sea of\
  \ welcome hugs and handshakes, my heart raced and my blood rushed backward. I feared\
  \ that my host wouldn\u2019t pick me up. I didn\u2019t have a backup plan if she\
  \ didn\u2019t and I didn\u2019t know anyone else in South Africa.\n\nWe connected\
  \ on Facebook while I was planning my coming of age trip. Fresh-faced, wet behind\
  \ the ears and hungry for the world, I was lacking in many ways, more so financially\
  \ although I wouldn\u2019t let that get in the way of my adventurous spirit. I strived\
  \ to save every coin towards this venture and I thought it would be such a great\
  \ relief if I didn\u2019t have to worry about accommodation. I also figured it would\
  \ be a great opportunity to live like a local if I found a host.\n\nI stood in despair,\
  \ shifting my weight left to right as I waited, watching every face hoping I would\
  \ catch a glimpse of her walking to my rescue. I berated myself for being so reckless,\
  \ what if she didn\u2019t come? I wondered. What if she did? Why didn\u2019t I have\
  \ nine other options for accommodation? While a million and one questions whirled\
  \ in my mind, I didn\u2019t notice that a group of three had walked towards me until\
  \ I was engulfed in hugs, taking turns.\nBewildered, I searched their faces, vaguely\
  \ familiar from the photos she shared of her family. My legs almost gave way in\
  \ relieve when I finally saw her. \n\n\u201CSorry, traffic was insane!\u201D\n\u201C\
  Your legs must be hurting, you should have sat down.\u201D\n\u201CI can\u2019t believe\
  \ you\u2019re really here! Part of me didn\u2019t really believe that you were coming\
  \ to visit us!\u201D\n\nBecause my accommodation was sealed, I tried to relax and\
  \ take in everything around me. I had never been to a big city before, so I allowed\
  \ myself to gape at everything \u2013 the wide roads without potholes, flashy billboards,\
  \ the flashier cars, working traffic lights, and tall buildings...There was so much\
  \ to see. Her brother announced that we would have a heavy brunch before we set\
  \ off for the 500 km to Hazyview in Mpumalanga Province, my home for the next few\
  \ weeks.\n\nBrunch was at a franchise restaurant with a branch at home I have just\
  \ recently started affording. I wasn\u2019t allowed to pay because apparently, I\
  \ was a long lost visiting sibling - from another mother and father. My only responsibility\
  \ the entire trip was to enjoy myself and when the time was up, get on the return\
  \ flight. I figured I could do as much. \n\nAs each took time off their lives to\
  \ show me around and explore with me, I reflected on the relationships we make on\
  \ our various adventures. While some are fleeting, most are lifelong and withstand\
  \ all seasons. Up to this day, once in a while one of them will ask me, \u201CHow\u2019\
  s mama?\u201D\n\nGetting introduced around the neighborhood as their sister who\
  \ lived in Uganda, because that explained why I didn\u2019t speak the language,\
  \ I started to feel a sense of belonging. In the course of the trip, we raced each\
  \ other through the forest to the top of God\u2019s Window where we were awestruck.\
  \ The sky was clear rendering the view from this point feel like you\u2019re indeed\
  \ watching the mountainous escarpment of Mpumalanga through God\u2019s Window. We\
  \ took sibling photos with Bourke\u2019s Luck Potholes, Blyde River Canyon and Mac\
  \ Mac Falls offering to-die-for backdrops and competed at who spotted which Big\
  \ 5 first in Paul Kruger National Park. What made it special was the fact that my\
  \ new siblings were really seeing all these for the first time, so all our excitement\
  \ was genuine.\n\nThe Hazyview market experience was unforgettable. I found myself\
  \ forgetting that I wasn\u2019t a local till I had to open my mouth to regrettably\
  \ announce that I can\u2019t speak Zulu or Sotho or Xhosa, so I could not bargain\
  \ for the best price of the ingredients for the braai that evening. \n\u201COh but\
  \ you look like one of us!\u201D while gesturing to my dreadlocks."
