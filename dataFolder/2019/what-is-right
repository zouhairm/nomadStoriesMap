Text: "Fei, Kristina and I were sitting on the wood bench, taking in our home for\
  \ the night. It was a single raised hut in the Khmu Village, a 13 km trek from the\
  \ Nam Khan River and nestled in the mountains of Luang Prabang. My bed consisted\
  \ of a single mattress on the floor, draped by a mosquito net and fitted with a\
  \ faintly purple sheet that was rough to the touch with grime. I was questioning\
  \ the last time it had been washed and how many people had slept there before me\
  \ when a woman, a neighbor directly across from my host family, began to rant. \n\
  \nShe did not seem to be yelling at anyone in particular and though I had no understanding\
  \ of the language, I could tell by the tense stance of the man that approached her,\
  \ his pointed finger and stern voice, that she was clearly out of place. He warned\
  \ her. But sitting on the porch step, gathering together the bristles of a broom,\
  \ she continued. As the blue hue of dusk began to overtake the mountains, the man\
  \ yanked the woman by the arm and threw her into the dirt. The woman struggled to\
  \ push him off, scrambling against his strength and clawing at his hands as he pulled\
  \ her up off the ground by her braid. Fei was livid \u2013 \u201CShouldn\u2019t\
  \ we do something?!\u201D \u2013 but we were torn within ourselves. Torn between\
  \ our Western ideals that taught us abuse is inherently wrong and by the fact that\
  \ we were foreigners in someone else\u2019s home, in a culture inherently different\
  \ from our own. So torn, we stayed seated on the bench with our heads hung low,\
  \ defeated by our inaction. \n\nI wish I could say someone stepped in to protect\
  \ the woman, but no such thing occurred. Our hosts \u2013the village leader, his\
  \ wife, and newborn son, along with our guide and about 15 other onlookers from\
  \ the tribe\u2014did nothing. I did nothing, could do nothing, so I wept. Overtaken\
  \ by emotion, a new sob escaped me with each of her wails and shaking, I buried\
  \ my face in Fei\u2019s shoulder as if I could hide from the sickening slap and\
  \ thud of fist to body contact. When the man was done and the woman silenced, she\
  \ was carried back inside her house whimpering. \n\nApart from my own fading sobs\
  \ and gasps, there was an eerie silence that followed, worsened by the weight of\
  \ stares upon me from the Khmu people. I felt embarrassed and ashamed, both at my\
  \ own weakness at not remaining composed and of staying right where I was seated\
  \ upon that bench.\n \nThis was an experience I never thought I'd encounter in any\
  \ of my travels, torn between my morality and of respecting another culture. When\
  \ I went to bed that night, my thoughts no longer revolved around the layer of grime\
  \ on my purple sheet but on what we had done,or rather, not done. Two years later\
  \ and I still question if we did the right thing."
