Text: "\u201CDieng kuwi artine tanah para Dewa...\u201D, said Bagus (in javanese),\
  \ our tour leader, in the mini bus that we chartered at Wonosobo to the village\
  \ called Patak Banteng. That words that came-out from Bagus mouth means: Dieng is\
  \ the land of Gods. And this is the story of my journey to discover where Gods sit\
  \ on their own thrones. \n\nThe story started when my colleagues and I decide to\
  \ see the first sunrise at the top of the mountain in the beginning of 2015. So,\
  \ our ideas is to open the new year to see sunrise yet we (still) cannot choose\
  \ which mountain that we should to leap on (after a month since this idea pop on\
  \ our minds). Until, Prau Mountain suddenly appear on my friend\u2019s PC. There\u2019\
  s no reason why we decide to choose this mountain, it\u2019s just we gave up on\
  \ choosing which mountain to hike.       \n\nDecember 31st 2014, finally we reach\
  \ the highest village in Indonesia, Patak Banteng, Wonosobo, Central Java. We spent\
  \ a couple of hours to rest our feet, to hike the Prau Mountain. \n\nJanuary 1st\
  \ 2015 at dawn, we\u2019re open our eyes wide to feel the air and feel the haze\
  \ that coming down from Prau \u2013 we know that was the aura of the God\u2019s\
  \ coming into our lungs. After that, we brave ourselves to hike that 2.565 meters\
  \ mountain, hope that we\u2019ll find the first sunrise at the opening year. \n\n\
  After 2.5 hours we trying to hike, we\u2019re at the top of Prau Mountain, yet we\
  \ didn\u2019t see any sunries until my watch said it was 6.00 AM. We give up, and\
  \ then we sat down and just chat each other. But there\u2019s something happened\
  \ to us when we decide to going back to the village. Suddenly all the fog running\
  \ through the grass and walk-follow our step, the fog is beside us. Then, the fog\
  \ running to the higher place and make a -i still don\u2019t believe this- like\
  \ twister (but not too dangerous) and the fog try to form itself look a like a throne.\
  \ We cannot close our eyes, just stare back and sit on that grass, we find the God\u2019\
  s thrones."
