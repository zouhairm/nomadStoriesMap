Text: "\u201CIt\u2019s freezing!\u201D we exclaimed as we exited Keflavik Airport.\
  \ \n\nRaised in Southern California and living in Australia, I have a low tolerance\
  \ and mild hatred for the cold, yet here I was in Iceland, in the winter. I blamed\
  \ Rachel. My friend stood beside me with her signature blue eyes and big smile,\
  \ breath visible in the cold as we stood in our layers of clothing before boarding\
  \ the bus. \n\nRecently unemployed and trying to forget about a relationship, I\
  \ needed to run as far as I could from home for a couple weeks; so I was glad to\
  \ adventure with her, even if it was in the freezing cold. I pushed those thoughts\
  \ to the back of my head as we made our way into our first destination: The Blue\
  \ Lagoon. \n\nSnow? Check. Bathing suits? Check. Did I say snow? Check. \n\nWe giggled\
  \ nervously as our bodies tensed to go outside in negative temperatures to the geothermal\
  \ hot springs. Fears abandoned, we embraced the warm, stunningly blue water. The\
  \ lagoon is an unnatural and magical blue hue caused by the silica content in the\
  \ water. A mud mask and sparkling strawberry wine were perfect accessories as we\
  \ glided through, exploring, laughing and soaking up our surreal surroundings.\n\
  \n\u201CI can\u2019t believe we\u2019re here!\u201D was a phrase commonly repeated\
  \ that day, and every other day of our trip. \n\nWe traversed the snow-blanketed\
  \ country to witness the Gulfoss and Skogafoss waterfalls, danced on the beaches\
  \ of Reynisfjara with frozen fingers and toes as the snow turned the black sand\
  \ white, and admired the S\xF3lheimaj\xF6kull Glacier as our tour guide explained\
  \ how it was melting. \n\nOur favorite tour guide, Gunther, taught us the history\
  \ of the Vikings with facts about how they used to speak into the walls of cliffs\
  \ to project their voices during big meetings. Driving through white-blanketed fields,\
  \ we watched the wind create smoke and flurries across the paved roads while Gunther\
  \ explained the custom of how people in Iceland received their names. Parents chose\
  \ first names, something we had in common, but the last name is typically taken\
  \ from the father\u2019s first name. If Gunther had a son named Thor, then his son\u2019\
  s full name would be Thor Guntherson. This information elicited many questions about\
  \ lineage and the how you referred to extended families. Gunther warmed to us as\
  \ we asked incessant questions and butchered the pronunciation of nearly every landmark\
  \ he showed us. We learned to say \u2018thank you\u2019 \u2013 \u2018tak feyrir\u2019\
  \ \u2013 while deciding Icelandic rye bread was amazing, rich with molasses and\
  \ surprisingly delicious in ice cream, but the local fermented shark meat was definitely\
  \ never to be tried again.\n\nWe jumped up and down, squealing as the green glow\
  \ of the Northern Lights glimmered across the sky, even if only for a moment. \u201C\
  I can\u2019t believe we\u2019re here!\u201D we whispered that night as we lay in\
  \ our warm plastic igloo, staring at the stars.\n\nOn one of our final nights, after\
  \ exploring the city center of Reykjavik, we bar- hopped our way home, stopping\
  \ at each place advertising a happy hour. While the slim, tattooed waiter delivered\
  \ drinks in the dimly lit back room of the bar, Rachel and I talked and laughed\
  \ as old friends who don\u2019t see each other often enough always do. I hadn\u2019\
  t expected to, but I nervously shared some of the not-so-fine details of my crumbling\
  \ relationship. Secrets I had kept carefully hidden from everyone for the past year\
  \ came tumbling out, but instead of judgment, I received comfort. \n\n\u201CI\u2019\
  m so sorry you\u2019ve been hurting, but I love you no matter what has happened.\u201D\
  \ \n\nBeing perpetually freezing while witnessing breathtaking and unforgettable\
  \ sights were my expectations for Iceland, and it far exceeded those. What I didn\u2019\
  t expect to find was sitting in that bar with my friend, sharing stories and hearing\
  \ those warm words of reassurance and love.\n\nIn the airport, a day later, we departed\
  \ to our respectful gates: Rachel returning to California, myself to the sunny Southern\
  \ Hemisphere. We hugged goodbye, whispering, \u201CI can\u2019t believe we\u2019\
  re here\u201D with a tinge of bittersweet excitement in anticipation of home."
