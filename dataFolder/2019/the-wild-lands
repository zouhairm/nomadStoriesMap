Text: "The border of the Scottish Highlands is marked by a barren tree. This tree\
  \ \u2013 a spindly, beaten-looking thing weary from a constant battle with the elements\
  \ \u2013 grows directly upwards from a boulder. The tree is ashen white that recalls\
  \ images of death, decaying skin, a skeleton stripped bare with dry and snapping\
  \ bones. The boulder, in contrast, lies draped in a mossy coat that looks velvety\
  \ to the touch. The emerald shades are rich against the sterile bark. The two, for\
  \ the tree would not exist without the boulder, create an oxymoronic sight from\
  \ the winding roadside; life, however desolate, emerging from the impossible and\
  \ inhospitable. \n\nWe have only just entered, yet I feel like this improbable tree\
  \ is trying to tell me something. Welcome to the wild lands. \n\nThere is something\
  \ incredibly untamed about the northern domains of Scotland. Deer roam through heather\
  \ bushes that are beginning to smoulder in shades of mauve and amethyst. Great waterfalls\
  \ carve trails through tumbling mountains, verdant carpets a blanket draped across\
  \ a sleeping body. It\u2019s a landscape of colour almost untouched by human hands.\
  \ \n\nA buzzard rises lazily, dipping in and out of the glen that scars the silver-plated\
  \ terrain we\u2019re driving through. I watch his flight as we trundle along roads\
  \ that can hardly be defined as such. But our guide, Caitlin \u2013 highland raised\
  \ with a knot of dreadlocks and an impish face pertaining to mischief \u2013 has\
  \ no fear navigating turns and dips in the road.\n\nThe reason my sister, Mollie,\
  \ and I are in Scotland? I\u2019m not entirely sure. A message sent two months previous\
  \ by our cousin, Clara, and now\u2026well. Now I\u2019m on a bus with ten Australians,\
  \ five Americans, a Canadian and two Chinese who have already exhausted a roll of\
  \ film between them. \n\nI resume watching the buzzard. His shadow stretches long\
  \ before disappearing beyond the folds of distant mountains. How vast the sky is\
  \ here. In every direction, it extends above enormous peaks, foothills of green\
  \ and lochs of an indescribable blue. I feel as though I am drowning in wildness.\
  \ \n\n*\n\nA biting wind tugs at my hair. Glen Coe. The site of a long-ago massacre\
  \ and an iconic stop in a tour of the Scottish Highlands. The air is thick with\
  \ cloud and full of rain. I trudge across mounds of earth made soggy by the moisture.\
  \ I can see others hiking further into the valley. I watch their progress, quickly\
  \ losing them to curls of fog. They are faceless shapes that roam the glen like\
  \ wraiths; wandering spirits zipped tightly into waterproof jackets, adorned in\
  \ scarfs and bobble hats. It\u2019s hard to believe that we\u2019re at the height\
  \ of summer. \n\nI reach a point in my trudging where all I can see are mountains.\
  \ Great slumbering creatures that pay no mind to the ants scrambling on their still\
  \ bodies. The wind is full of breathless forms \u2013 I can hear snatches of conversation,\
  \ the creak of moving trees, the cries of a massacre. Yet, above it all, I can hear\
  \ the strains of bagpipes. \n\nI call to my sister for reassurance of my sanity.\
  \ She pauses, tilting her head towards the wind in the manner of a small creature\
  \ alert for dangerous prey. \u201CNo, I can hear it too. But why does it sound so\u2026\
  \u201D Her face crumples in confusion. \n\nWe hurry, seeking the source of a hauntingly\
  \ familiar melody. It drifts across rain-swept slopes, rising, falling. We clamber\
  \ across loose gravel and splash through boggy puddles. When we eventually stumble\
  \ across the piper, clad in traditional tartan, he creates a striking contrast of\
  \ colour beneath the leaden sky. He stands in solitude, the labour of his breaths\
  \ enchanting as it echoes through the glen. All around me are enraptured faces engulfed\
  \ in something like awe. \n\nThe music follows me like a shadow, ringing in my ears\
  \ long after I leave its embrace. Only that evening, halfway between dreams and\
  \ consciousness, do I recognise the strains as the Skye Boat Song. An ancient tale\
  \ of a prince who fled over the sea and a woman with the purest heart. Or, as others\
  \ may know it, the opening song of Outlander."
