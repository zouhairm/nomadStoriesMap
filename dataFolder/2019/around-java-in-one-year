Text: "I ever go anywhere yet,  wrote it like it now, hitherto. I am javanese man\
  \ about 37 years old. Berit-adventurer from finland-indonesian is scary people.\
  \ They scared to the ghost,  they're scare to travelling alone and afraid of darkness.\
  \ She said in TV.  I watched TV for Antoine bourdain and Bondan winarno,  both the\
  \ chef adventurers. Poorly,  both of them now,  has become deceased.  It's quite\
  \ literally I am not go anywhere.\nmerely,  had picnic in Bali three times. From\
  \ the past, undergraduate and in the term of I worked. My conclusion,  Bali is exotic\
  \ place and exclusive-for the have-not the place for poor man.  I had going around\
  \ Yogjakarta province. There are dirived 5 district like Yogyakarta district (municipal),\
  \  district of gunung kidul,  district of Bantul,  district of sleman,  and district\
  \ of kulonprogo.  In kulonprogo I looked of a place for rehabilitation of drugs\
  \ abuse victims. Truly, Yogyakarta  is never ending Asia. I had going around solo\
  \ -the other names is surakarta hadiningrat-a most powerful of Javanese city that\
  \ surrounded by solo city, sukoharjo district,  district of klaten and the district\
  \ of Boyolali. I had going around by bike. Truly,  solo: the spirit of Java. \n\
  I had going around central Java,  especially the villages nearest the forests. Beginning\
  \ from klaten,  karanganyar (the place that I have been loved now) wonogiri,  sragen,\
  \  purwodadi,  tegal,  pemalang,  magelang. \nAnd,  five years in salatiga city.\
  \ Except Bali,  Yogyakarta and Solo nearly every where I went is not the sightseeing\
  \ places but I learn much cultures there. The Javanese culture is variative and\
  \ powerful.  I think like that. \nIn Java,  there are so many food which we find\
  \ from sheep satay,  goat satay, chicken satay,  porcupine satay, rabbit satay,\
  \ chicken Soto, meat ball from cows, tofu kupat,  Tofu acar,gado-gado, Lotek, tofu\
  \ campus from salatiga,  chicken noodles,  liwet rice from solo,  gudeg from yogyakarta\
  \ for food. And beverage are ice tea, Dawet ice, Cincau ice, orange juice. \nIn\
  \ Java the sun always rise a thought in the wet season. Wet season are now,  in\
  \ November to February and dry season in March until September every years. The\
  \ season can predictable. So,  the adventurers can wear sandals and T-shirt shirt\
  \ only. In the night,  we saw a gamelan almost every day but for the short single\
  \ day. Gamelan plays a teenager in junior high school as locals subject. Also, \
  \ traditional dancing happened in ceremonial days. Javanese day only five days there\
  \ are pon,  wage, kliwon, pahing,  and Legi. It's call as Dino pasaran but post-modetnism\
  \ the days are Sunday,  Monday,  Tuesday,  Wednesday,  Thursday, Friday and Saturday.\
  \ From that the Javanese believed that the day change into for example,  senin Legi,\
  \ selasa pon, sunday pon, Monday kliwon and the other combining days after thirty\
  \ days it become the first day,  it called selapanan. Although I  ever go to Bandung\
  \ that postscript are sundaness. Malang,  east Java that Maduresse. I can guarantee\
  \ before you go anywhere the fist step is your mother culture for me Java. You can\
  \ love the culture from anywhere for special culture if it can be long time to spend\
  \ at once. There's different of picnic and adventure. Unfortunately,  Bandung, \
  \ malang and Bali that's only picnic  or study tour. It's mean organized by tour\
  \ agent and short time-it spend three days and two nights for Malang and Bandung\
  \ and four days and four nights for Bali tours. In that days,  it's far away from\
  \ adventurers travelling from the west man spend. For example,  there is a young\
  \ doctor from Australia that travelling to Bali for three months. Like the other,\
  \  Jean couteau,  Walter spies and Margared mead. They don't 'picnics',  they are\
  \ really adventures and I ever go anywhere yet, because of them. I'm not strictly\
  \ a solo act.  Who knows?  Best regards."
