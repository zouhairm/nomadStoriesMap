Text: "In the summer of 2013, I was 16, and I had been locked in the house for nearly\
  \ three months. Naturally, rumours of my disappearance had started to circulate\
  \ amongst kids in the neighbourhood and at school. People conjured up theories that\
  \ I had been knocked up, that I was shipped off to rehab, or had been forced to\
  \ get married. But, there is no extraordinary reason as to why I had been locked\
  \ away that summer. I was a teenager, I acted like one, and that\u2019s how I had\
  \ to pay for it. That\u2019s how many girls in The Kingdom have to pay for acting\
  \ out against the twisted, outdated cultural rules they grow up with, or simply,\
  \ for disobeying their father. \n\nI had no connection to the outside world aside\
  \ from the few online exchanges I had managed with a friend in Brussels; he made\
  \ a lot of effort to keep me sane. The only times I left the house were for family\
  \ dinners. I would sit there with my head down on the table or picking at the food\
  \ on my plate. I was always exhausted, and the circles under my eyes had become\
  \ a permanent fixture on my face. I spent all my time in my room. The wall to the\
  \ left of my bed was covered in thoughts I wrote down on pieces of paper. I tried\
  \ to stay active - to read books, work on some sketches, or meditate, but most of\
  \ the time I ended up staring at the ceiling for hours.\n\nI learned a lot about\
  \ myself that summer, and as time went on, my depression morphed into anger. It\
  \ wasn\u2019t the bitter, pitiful feeling I was used to. This was the kind of fire\
  \ that got me out of bed in the morning, forced me to eat three meals a day and\
  \ keep them down, and gave me the energy to focus on what I needed to do \u2013\
  \ find a way out of Saudi Arabia. Under the guardianship law, I couldn\u2019t legally\
  \ leave without permission from my father, and the only way I would earn that approval\
  \ was by getting into university.\n\nOn July 5th, 2018, after four years of culture\
  \ shock, horrible people, wonderful people, anxiety-ridden exams, countless all-nighters,\
  \ hundreds of first-times, a lot of laughter, and a lot of fight, I graduated with\
  \ honours from the University of Birmingham. I had the outlines of a plan. Well...it\
  \ was the plan that is kind of automatically written for everyone once they graduate\
  \ \u2013 find a job. But, things started to change. \n\nI had always dreamed of\
  \ seeing the world, and the more I thought about it, the more it became clear that\
  \ the next few months would perhaps be the only time in my life that I had the chance\
  \ to travel extensively on my own. So, I decided to take the leap and head on my\
  \ first solo adventure. I no longer had an address, nor any idea what I was doing.\
  \ All I could hope for was that everything I needed was in my backpack.\n\nOn the\
  \ 4th of September I boarded a flight to Malta, shaking with fear and anticipation.\
  \ Little did I know that in the coming weeks, I would laugh at how disappointing\
  \ it was to see the leaning tower of Pisa and wake up with swollen feet after hours\
  \ of searching for lemon trees. Or that I would indulge in the most amazing meal\
  \ of my life in Paris, rock out with a 65 year old at a fish market in Hamburg,\
  \ or wander around beautiful Scottish beach towns.\n\nFor a long time, I was bitter\
  \ about my upbringing. But I refuse to allow it to do anything other than add to\
  \ the richness of my life - to help me experience the simplest beauties in magnificent\
  \ ways, and to lead me into the unknown with an open heart. \n\nPeople always ask\
  \ what it was like to grow up in Saudi. They muse about how women who live there\
  \ have no control or power. But they will never understand. Growing up, I never\
  \ wanted power. I wanted freedom."
