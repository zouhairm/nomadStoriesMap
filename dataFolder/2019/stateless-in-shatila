Text: "\u201CI am terrorist\u201D, the teenage boy says and he laughs. His friend\
  \ leans on his shoulder and flashes a beaming set of straight white teeth.\nI am\
  \ on my way to the Children and Youth Centre of Shatila Refugee Camp in outer Beirut.\
  \ It is actually a neighbourhood and its inhabitants are not refugees; the younger\
  \ generation were born here, the older have called it home for thirty years. \n\
  It is a maze of seven-storey compartments, filthy grey and draped with layers of\
  \ washing, the concrete balconies towering over narrow alleys strewn with rubbish\
  \ and soaked in sewage. The gap between the buildings, sometimes no more than a\
  \ metre wide, is hung with an ugly net of thick black cables.\nUnder this mess of\
  \ electrical wires, the children play. \u201CTake photo!\u201D they shout, posing\
  \ with their two fingers raised in the international sign of peace. Snap! They scurry\
  \ to grab some toys that lie scattered about the paved concrete. \u201CTake photo!\u201D\
  \ This time they hold plastic guns in the air, brandishing these fake weapons above\
  \ their heads. \nBehind them, the walls are painted thick with a jumble of Palestinian\
  \ flags, images of jail bars and chains, burning American flags, a swastika. The\
  \ bricks are plastered with peeling posters of Yasser Arafat, Saddam Hussein and\
  \ Che Guevara.\nThere is no space for the kids to run around in the cramped alleys\
  \ so cram into the internet cafe to pretend shooting animated soldiers. When two\
  \ men walk past strapped with bullet-proof vests and carrying huge semi-automatic\
  \ guns, not one child bats an eyelid.\nThe boy who called himself a terrorist is\
  \ still watching me: \u201CWelcome to Shatila,\u201D he grins. \u201CWelcome to\
  \ Paradise.\u201D \nMahmoud has come from a camp in North Lebanon which has been\
  \ under siege by the Lebanese army for ten days. He smiles when he says that his\
  \ brother was killed last week. He smiles when he describes how he ran from the\
  \ camp alone when there was a break in the fighting. His mother is still back there.\n\
  \u201CWho helped you escape?\u201D I ask. He flashes a look of defiance. \u201C\
  Nobody.\u201D\nThe Palestinians of northern Lebanon have recently fled to Shatila,\
  \ refugees from a refugee camp. Hundreds of families in Shatila opened their tiny\
  \ homes to welcome the strangers. A few days later,  fighting erupted at another\
  \ camp in the south causing thousands more to arrive.\nPalestinians in Lebanon are\
  \ banned from owning homes, Mahmoud explains. Confined to squalid areas like Shatila\
  \ and barred from well-paid jobs, they work illegally in return for a pittance.\
  \ They will never possess Lebanese citizenship.\nHis friend adds, \u201CWe are not\
  \ people, just rubbish.\u201D\nAs I continue through the narrow streets of the camp,\
  \ I am ushered in for cups of tea and puffs of water pipe. Crowded around a dinner\
  \ table with four generations, we dig into hummus and falafel with our fingers from\
  \ a communal dish among scores of children, distant relatives and neighbours. The\
  \ door is always open as friends stroll in and out.\nThe news blares constantly\
  \ from a television in the corner. They all fall silent when their camp appears\
  \ on the screen, projectile missiles ripping through and dissolving buildings into\
  \ smoke and rubble. They have family members trapped inside the concrete blocks\
  \ that have just vanished before our eyes. A man turns to me and with one hand he\
  \ indicates around him to the children squatting on the carpet. \u201CWe are all\
  \ afraid,\u201D he says.\nWhen I finally arrive at the Children and Youth Centre,\
  \ responsible for keeping the children distracted from their own lives, director\
  \ Abu Moujahed pulls open a drawer for me and unloads one knife after another that\
  \ he has confiscated from the kids. \n \u201CWe have a joke in Shatila,\u201D he\
  \ says. \u201CThe devil comes to take a man to hell. The man tells him, \u2018I\
  \ will be happy to go with you because anything must be better than here.'\u201D\
  \nOutside in the tiny concrete square that serves as the only playground, some kids\
  \ kick a tennis ball around because they don\u2019t have a football. \n\u201CIf\
  \ you visit this place,\u201D Abu Moujahed says before I leave, \u201Cyou will know\
  \ that God doesn\u2019t exist.\u201D"
