Text: "Dawn was breaking when my mother woke me up. I hadn\u2019t seen a sunrise in\
  \ months ever since I became a creature of the night. Before I could slip out of\
  \ the confinements of my room, my mother\u2019s welled up eyes froze me. She could\
  \ only manage to say, \u201CYour grandfather.\u201D Then slowly shook her head and\
  \ walked out. \nI noticed my father and uncle sitting in the living room. The whole\
  \ house was so silent as if it was empty. We were all so still as if holding our\
  \ breaths, trying to shrink within and avoid each other\u2019s glistened glances.\
  \ There was so much to say but no words, so many emotions with no way to express\
  \ them.\nNext thing I remember, we were already in the car. Driving on a familiar\
  \ road to a familiar destination. It was a cold November morning, but all of us\
  \ had cracked our windows. Somehow our breaths were colder than the wind. I took\
  \ a deep breath, closed my eyes and rested my head on my mother\u2019s shoulder.\
  \ I could feel her moving her arm slowly to wipe her tears, but one would always\
  \ escape and somehow mix with mine. \nWhen we entered our village, the crops that\
  \ were green a while back where now brown and dry. Some were cut and some were burned\
  \ to the ground. There were no birds singing the morning song. We didn\u2019t overtake\
  \ any carts with beautifully decorated oxen. There were no jubilant women working\
  \ in the fields, or fetching pitchers of water. No bell rang in the school near\
  \ the lake.    \nThe world was slowly rolling out of its slumber, but my world had\
  \ stopped moving. Death crept in, in the shadows of the night and robbed me. I didn\u2019\
  t even get a chance to say goodbye. Even now, I\u2019m not able to. The warmth of\
  \ my memories with him won\u2019t let me. Every turn we take, I peep out of the\
  \ window to see if he\u2019s there to welcome us. He\u2019s always been like that.\
  \ Whenever we\u2019d come for a visit, we\u2019d always find him waiting at my uncle\u2019\
  s shop. He\u2019d refuse to get in the car. Instead, he\u2019d walk beside to escort\
  \ us and tell with the brightest of smiles that his grandchildren had finally come\
  \ home. He gave the best hugs in the world. He had a pot-belly like Santa and hair\
  \ white as snow. When I was little, I couldn\u2019t even wrap my arms around him.\
  \ He\u2019d laugh so heartily at this that his belly would shake which made me laugh.\
  \ He didn\u2019t share a very expressive relationship with his own children, which\
  \ is why he had a hard time expressing his affection to me or my brother. During\
  \ childhood we shared our playtime with him, even pushed him when he was reluctant.\
  \ And in our adulthood, we shared his silence. I wish that I had tried harder to\
  \ get through to him. First the loss of his beloved wife, and then a young grandchild\
  \ was too much for his kind heart to bear. \nWhen I entered our house I could hear\
  \ the women wailing but it was the heart-wrenching wails of my aunty, who lost the\
  \ father that got her through the loss of her child that brought me back to the\
  \ now.\nOur house was the same yet different. My fingers remembered the maps of\
  \ the bricks and yet I couldn\u2019t recognize the walls that were slowly closing\
  \ in. I slipped out to hide in the guest room. The walls were decorated with family\
  \ photographs and portraits. I stared blankly at them, then with some hope, but\
  \ none of them uttered a word of comfort. I guess they were hurting too. \nI knew\
  \ he was waiting for me in the hall. I knew he\u2019d never go without saying goodbye.\
  \ As I entered, I saw a small figure wrapped in white. He had a pale and gentle\
  \ face, with his eyes closed. He looked like my grandfather, but I knew it wasn\u2019\
  t him. A tear escaped my eye, but it never touched my cheek or the ground. My grandfather\
  \ might have taken it as his farewell present."
