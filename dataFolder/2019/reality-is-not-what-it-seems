Text: "It was snowing. O-M-G. I was amazed.\n\nI remember when I was a little girl,\
  \ I used to watch cartoons, sitting on the couch, wondering how nice would it be\
  \ to feel the snow in my face, while I played outside the house with my imaginary\
  \ friends. Let me give you a glimpse of my background. I'm from a city on the northeast\
  \ side of Brazil, called Recife. Here, we only have two climates: summer and rainy\
  \ summer, a.k.a \"winter\". So, because of the lack of cold, I've become obsessed\
  \ with snowy places, like Iceland. Bjork (muse) and Death Metal, the Winter Olympics\
  \ and, mostly, Ice Skating. I used to sit and watch all the time. Well, every four\
  \ years.\n\nUntil one day, I went to a DVD store to rent a movie, and I saw a girl\
  \ wearing ice skating boots and looking awesome. It was the cover of Ice Princess.\
  \ In a nutshell, the story is about a girl, called Casey, who is great at getting\
  \ A's but can't fit in. She is not really good at Ice Skating but wants to give\
  \ it a try anyway and afterward, discovers that she wants to do it for the rest\
  \ of her life (and not physics). The rink is where she feels the most of herself,\
  \ I remember she saying. The movie is a blockbuster, but it has taught me that I\
  \ can do whatever I want, with discipline and practice and a lot of setbacks. Of\
  \ course that after I saw that movie, I insisted that I wanted to be an Ice Skater.\
  \ But soon after I realized that it wouldn't be possible. There's no ice in here.\
  \ Duh. So I put this dream/feeling inside the locker and moved on. \n\nFast forward\
  \ 10 years, It was February of 2018, one year ago, and I was in Chicago, visiting\
  \ my best friend, having the time of my life. Except not. I went on this trip thinking\
  \ that I would be able to know exactly what to do with my future self, go to dive\
  \ bars and meet interesting people and feel like I belong. And It wasn't quite like\
  \ I've planned. Let's begin with the choice of the place. I went to Chicago, right?\
  \ What is that weather? Gosh, the cold was too cold and too windy and I felt like\
  \ I was about to lose one of my members at any point. It wasn't that glamorous (except\
  \ the architecture (thanks to Mies Van der Rohe) ), people weren't dancing in the\
  \ subways, I saw people almost dying of cold, nobody looked at my face, and everybody\
  \ seemed to pretty ok by themselves. \n\nSo I've struggled. I've never felt so alone,\
  \ and so lost. I wondered, \"what am I doing here?\". All-the-time. But I never\
  \ thought I could enjoy myself as I much as did there. I went to parks and museums\
  \ and tried to understand the city and the people, instead of judging. And one day,\
  \ the day that snowed, my best friend decided to bring me to the Ice Skating Rink\
  \ at Millenium Park. And, again, It wasn't perfect, and I fell a lot, but one thing\
  \ I had for sure, that It wasn't about that. Because on that day, I felt the snow\
  \ in my face. And in that rink, with my butt all wet and my feet being smashed by\
  \ my boots, I was an Ice Skater. And nobody could take that away."
