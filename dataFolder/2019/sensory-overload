Text: "The elements battled against my lenses. I was thigh-deep in a milky pool of\
  \ deliriously warm water when the crisp air fought its fight. I was blind.\n\nMy\
  \ glasses had steamed up. I wiped them, I washed them, I begged them to clear away\
  \ their fog, but they surrendered. The air and the water, so polarised in their\
  \ temperatures, was too much for my little panes of glass to take. I can\u2019t\
  \ see without my pink, speckled friends. I especially can\u2019t see in an already\
  \ foggy natural spring, at 8pm in Icelandic winter, when the sky paints a new shade\
  \ of black never before seen to any human in history. I was, temporarily, blind.\
  \ \n\nTiny mountainous goosebumps erupted atop my skin as I took the first few shaky\
  \ steps out into the hot spring. The air was clear. The coldest, most invigorating\
  \ air I\u2019d ever breathed or could ever hope to breathe again filled my lungs\
  \ as my legs met the water. The harsh smell of sulphur filled my nostrils, an odd\
  \ match for the blurry, blue and black vista before me. My hand firmly on the metal\
  \ rail, I took the last few steps to be fully covered by the white, ethereal liquid.\
  \ It was squishy! Soft, thick, squishy mud enveloped my toes, hugging me to stay\
  \ in place. We ventured on. My hand atop my best friend\u2019s shoulder for support,\
  \ we waded our way through the water when after a few moments, she turned to me,\
  \ a smile spread wide across her face and whispered \u201Cprosecco\u201D. It was\
  \ the day of our 21st and 22nd birthdays, respectively, as we paddled our way up\
  \ to the makeshift bar. With a small grimace at the price to pay for a drink, we\
  \ threw caution to the wind and reached out our hands. I heard our plastic flutes\
  \ make a dull clink together in a celebratory union, our fingers frozen from the\
  \ chilled alcohol and the cutting night air. The cold liquid fizzed and popped against\
  \ my tongue. I melted away with each sip.\n\nA while later, my familiar guide leading\
  \ the way through the seemingly infinite spring, I heard a voice cut through the\
  \ darkness. \u201CIt\u2019s you!\u201D. A deep and thick Northern Irish accent shouted\
  \ from an unknown locale, \u201CYou\u2019re the girl from the toilets last night!\u201D\
  . I was astounded. The very same man I\u2019d been speaking to in a toilet queue\
  \ in an Irish bar in Reykjavik the night before was also submerged in the pearly,\
  \ sulphuric pool, less than 10 feet away from me. His voice painted a vivid picture\
  \ in my mind, taking me back to dancing and Guinness and joy. After exchanging pleasantries,\
  \ and after having to deny his invitation to join his stag do multiple times, we\
  \ parted ways. I wondered if we would ever meet again when I bumped into a man floating\
  \ on his back and accidentally dunked him under the water. I mumbled a bashful \u201C\
  sorry!\u201D in the general direction of his shadow. My hand returned to my friend,\
  \ and we escaped as fast as one can in chest-high water, feet sunken into clay.\
  \ \n\nI cannot see the world without my pink speckled friends, but on that beautifully\
  \ cold night in Iceland, I learned that I can definitely feel it."
