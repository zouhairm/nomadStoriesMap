Text: "I don't think you need a lesson in Italian beauty. Whether you've been there\
  \ before or not, you all know it exists in some form. In Comedians in Cars Getting\
  \ Coffee, Jerry Seinfeld (the host) is asked by his guest, as she refers to the\
  \ beautiful colours of old Fiat's; \"if Italian's can do it why can't everybody\
  \ else.... did they invent that colour?\". Jerry responds, \"that might just be\
  \ the dumbest question I have heard anyone ask.... they (Italians) invented the\
  \ eyeball that knows that\u2019s the right colour\". \n\nWhat makes Italy so beautiful?\
  \ If we think about a country's total beauty being something greater than the sum\
  \ of its parts, I guess it\u2019s 'food and people culture' would assume a large\
  \ slice of the\u2026pizza. Surely its natural and built forms would take, at least,\
  \ an equally large slice. What about the other things which have, throughout time,\
  \ managed to become so emblematic of Italy? Take the Vespa, for example.  \n\nWe\
  \ had seen the most incredible natural creations during our time in Italy. So much\
  \ so that at times there were just no more superlatives left. It was almost as if\
  \ we could no longer absorb the beauty before us. So, we set out to be at one with\
  \ nature. We had become the Volcanic Spring Chasers. In Italian, it\u2019s called\
  \ a Terme. Everywhere we went we would ask, \"C\u2019e una terme vicino qui?\u201D\
  \ (is there a Terme near here?). \n\nYes, Italy is a land of intense natural beauty.\
  \ Sure, you can chase it and find yourself far away from development and the crowded\
  \ cities. But going off the beaten track isn't without its troubles, nor does it\
  \ guarantee you the pleasure one so desires. \n\nThe pattern with our travels has\
  \ become obvious. Like a standard bell curve, we find ourselves struggling to find\
  \ something special, to be courageous, and to do something crazy. We figure Fortune\
  \ favours the bold right?! We struggle and struggle and the frustration and self-pity\
  \ rises within us. Once we are in this position, it\u2019s never clear if the struggle\
  \ will be worth it or if it will end at all. Until, for a tiny, momentary peak at\
  \ the top of that curve, the struggle flattens out, subsides, and then pleasure\
  \ sets in. We forget the struggle, even if only momentarily. \n\nIf we are lucky,\
  \ (and in many cases we are/were), the struggle is in hindsight fairly benign. \n\
  \nHowever, if we are less lucky, the peaks and troughs are higher and more frequent,\
  \ causing more grief. It is every peak, with its concealed yet inevitable decent,\
  \ aiding and abetting the foolishness that comes with assuming that pleasure can\
  \ stay perched in perpetuity. In these times, the descent back down the curve is\
  \ steeper, more slippery and more serious than I would like. Like the time we had\
  \ successfully gone off the beaten track to go hiking in Pratovecchio, but then\
  \ got 'caught' in the 'Beast from the East' which blanketed most of Italy in snow.\
  \ We had, only an hour or so before, gone from praising each other for deciding\
  \ to travel to Pratovecchio, to fearing for our lives as our car slid out of control\
  \ on the icy roads towards a steep embankment. \n\nIn all cases enjoyment had emerged\
  \ at some point. However, the point isn't that we are unlucky, but that we shouldn't\
  \ be surprised when bad things happen, for if they can happen, they may just happen.\
  \ Auschwitz survivor Viktor Frankl knew it and implored us to change ourselves when\
  \ we are no longer able to change a situation. 19th Century pessimist Arthur Schopenhauer\
  \ knew this and encouraged us to find avenues through which we could convert pain\
  \ into knowledge. Fourth Century BC philosopher Seneca probably understood it better\
  \ than anyone, concluding that there is nothing Fortune does not dare; that we are\
  \ injured most by what we do not expect. Of course, with a capital 'F' he was referring\
  \ to the Goddess of Fortune, who with her cornucopia and rudder in hand, she could,\
  \ with a coy smile on her face, bestow gifts or inflict terrible pain on us whenever\
  \ she decided to."
