Text: "I sat on a lily-white deck chair, carved by the bristled hands of the man who\
  \ owned this Mama Mia-styled \u2018Apartmani Cvitanovic\u2019 hilltop villa. He\
  \ sat sleeping next to me, Goran was his name. He seemed to carry the weight of\
  \ his eighty-nine stressful years in the wrinkles on his forehead, and I wondered\
  \ exactly what \u2013 in a place as serene as this \u2013 could have caused such\
  \ trenches. I promised myself I would find out.\n\tI could smell the salty sea spray\
  \ of the water below, the cool breeze seeming to carry it up to me like a tune.\
  \ Behind me, a kilometre-high mountain as opaque as the blue sky behind it, sat\
  \ towering over the little town of Igrane below. From up there, the seasonal three\
  \ hundred tourists must have looked like peppercorns, dotted around the harbour.\
  \ Oh how oblivious they were.\nIts pastel colours reminded me of a watercolour painting\
  \ I had done at home in Australia years ago, when I had tripped on my cat\u2019\
  s tail, and watched \u2013 powerless, as the palette slipped from my fingers, and\
  \ a river of purple liquid smudged my canvass. Unlike the scrambled vision of my\
  \ first and last artistic venture, these mountains were flawless, like one of Monet\u2019\
  s finest, and seemed to stand guard over the town.\n I wondered what harboured secrets\
  \ they might be keeping in this perfect piece of paradise.\n\tGoran, the gentle\
  \ giant beside me grumbled back to life. He checked his wrist for a watch that he\
  \ didn\u2019t have. \n\t\u201CTime for swim.\u201D\n \tI watched, intrigued, as\
  \ his sun pashed body vanished down the Villa stairs, and reappeared fifty meters\
  \ down at the rocks below, where the emerald hands of the Adriatic were grabbing\
  \ at the shore. It seemed to glisten slightly as he entered, as if it were welcoming\
  \ home an old friend. They were as timeless as each other, and as rich with history.\n\
  \tI knew from being an Australian what smoke and mirrors could do to a place. Sandy\
  \ white beaches, snow-capped mountains, kangaroo\u2019s. What you didn\u2019t see\
  \ was the smoke screen emerging from the burning pages of a history book that Australians\
  \ wanted forgotten. Too bad it doesn\u2019t work like that. \n\tTo my left, an unspoiled\
  \ old woman blew into the Villa like a sea storm, with no trace of the hundred or\
  \ so steps that she had climbed to get here. \nShe wore a long, coloured tassel\
  \ dress, which appeared to be the local uniform here. She mumbled something in Croatian,\
  \ but I didn\u2019t recognise it. Hilda, Goran\u2019s daughter appeared to my rescue.\
  \ \u201CShe wants to know why you are not swimming,\u201D Hilda said, carrying a\
  \ basket of fish, lemons and figs. She placed them down on the table next to me.\n\
  \u201CSoon,\u201D I said with a smile \u2013 which was the only currency consistent\
  \ between Australia and this one. Or so I thought.\nThe elderly woman \u2013 who\
  \ was later introduced as Bura, continued to reel off a thick typhoon of Croatian\
  \ phrases.\n\u201CHer neighbours are trying to claim title to her property again,\u201D\
  \ Hilda explained, dipping the fish in a thin layer of flour and egg and piling\
  \ them up on the table in front of me. My stomach howled.\n\u201CDoes that happen\
  \ often?\u201D I asked, trying to distract myself from the sweet-smelling batter.\n\
  \u201CAll the time.\u201D\n \u201CWhy?\u201D I asked.\nHilda turned to Bura, \u201C\
  \u010Demu?\u201D\n\u201CLakom,\u201D she answered, shaking her head. \nI didn\u2019\
  t need that one translated.  I had once spent the weekend with a Croatian friend\
  \ in Melbourne. Her mother had made baked cookies, and my friend had reached out\
  \ to grab two. That\u2019s how I knew, that Lakom meant greedy, and Svinja meant\
  \ pig.\n\u201COur village only opens for four months a year, after that everything\
  \ is closing. When it is getting colder, people are getting\u2026 restless.\u201D\
  \nI knew what she meant. I wondered if that was the reason the Europeans stole land\
  \ from the Aboriginal people, because they were restless.\nAs I sat in this perfect\
  \ piece of paradise, with the sea lapping at my toes, I wondered whether it was\
  \ the act of being human that made us innately Lakom, or whether it was something\
  \ fostered by culture."
