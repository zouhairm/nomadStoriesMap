Text: "The year was 1999, and I had just turned 21, dropped out of college and decided\
  \ to migrate for economic reason from my home state in Nigeria.\n\nThere was, however,\
  \ a snag as all I had was a map and a sketch of how and where to change vehicles\
  \ at specific towns in each country I'd be journeying through. \n\nFortunately,\
  \ on the night I was to board the check out bus from my small town of Benin City,\
  \ Nigeria, en route Katsina State, bordering Nigeria and the Niger Republic, half\
  \ the passengers on the bus turned out to be making the same journey, so we all\
  \ naturally gelled and formed a group going forward.\n\nPertinent to state here\
  \ that the ultimate target of our journey was to hit Morocco from where we could\
  \ either Climb across the razor fences separating Morocco from either of Spain\u2019\
  s enclave of Ceuta and Melilla, both on mainland Morocco. This would be like crossing\
  \ from Mexico into the US.\nI'd experienced co-travellers collapsing, having to\
  \ recycle and drink our urine when we had run out on water, to being out rightly\
  \ abandoned in the deserts.\n\nTravelling through the deserts we did come upon a\
  \ couple of human skeletal remains of some unfortunate travellers.\n\n\nWe had gotten\
  \ our standard supplies of baguettes, sardines and milk to survive on, just enough\
  \ and not too heavy to burden us on the long walk.\n\n\nSo, we'd continued until\
  \ I, eventually took a short rest, and afterwards got separated from the group and\
  \ I knew not what way to continue on without the group and the guide.\n\nI had resorted\
  \ to going about, begging for food from some locals, who were so kind enough to\
  \ render me help-God bless them. \n\nThese locals would actually get into trouble\
  \ with the authorities if it were to become public knowledge that they were harbouring,\
  \ or failed to report sighting an alien. But these guys would take me in and gave\
  \ me tea to keep me warm. \n\nWhen I got to Nador, I was lost on how to proceed\
  \ any further being all by myself.\n\nWhile thinking about my life and how/where\
  \ to proceed on, a bike had driven up to me and the rider motioned me to hop on.\
  \ I was at first hesitant, but when he insisted, I obliged. \n\nHe drove me for\
  \ about 5 kilometres and brought the bike to a halt, and asked me to keep leftwards,\
  \ and climb a super mountain across, that if I did as he was advising in broken\
  \ French, Arabic and hand signals, it'd bring me closer to the razor fences separating\
  \ the town of Nador in Morocco from Melilla in Spain.\n\n\nFrom my reckoning, I\
  \ had started ascending this mountain at about past 8 pm when the man had dropped\
  \ me off, and when I eventually got to the peak of the mountain, where I could now\
  \ see all around Nador, and also look into the Spanish territory, it must have taken\
  \ me about 3 hours. I'd become fired up anyway, not minding how battered I was from\
  \ the long climb, at least I was so close to Spain, I could actually see vehicles\
  \ driving around.\n\nWhile I was still basking in the euphoria of my new found luck,\
  \ and planning on where to attack the Spanish fences from, the heavens had given\
  \ way, and it started raining cats and dogs with nowhere in sight to take shelter.\
  \ \n\nI'd dejectedly continued on my solitary walk, with no particular direction\
  \ until I happened upon a cemetery.\n\nWhen I had arrived at the cemetery at about\
  \ 12\u20131 am, I couldn't hold it in any longer. I simply broke down and cried\
  \ my hearts out, all the while thinking about my family and friends, and how not\
  \ one of them knew my whereabouts, nor what I was having to deal with at that point\
  \ in time, all by myself.\n\nAfter all, with the rain subsided, I hadn't the will\
  \ to continue on the walk any further that night, I simply felt and reached for\
  \ the closest grave to me, which I had slept on while saying a prayer for the soul\
  \ resting therein."
