Text: "Every trip I take, I often go through a myriad of emotions before, during and\
  \ after adventure. But the strange encounters of the spiritual kind I have had during\
  \ my solo travels across India over the years, has offered a roadmap to maturity.\
  \ \n\nThe frail Jain Sadhvi I met while climbing the countless steps to the Palitana\
  \ mountain in Gujarat, a solitary, stooped figure clad in billowing white, her peacock\
  \ feather fan in her hands as she carefully dusted each step before she stepped\
  \ on it, to clear it off any insect or ant that may be crawling on it. 'Chant Om\
  \ Namo Arihantanam every night, and you will be free from fear', she told me, smiling\
  \ a wide smile with half the teeth missing.\n\nThe gentle High Lama from Spiti,\
  \ a Rinpoche, whose brown eyes crinkled and almost disappeared into his cheeks as\
  \ he smiled a child-like mischievous smile. He was a Trulku \u2013 a reincarnated\
  \ lama who had recognised and was reunited with his chief disciples from an earlier\
  \ life! He joked, he threw back his head and guffawed. It looked like he did not\
  \ have a care in the world!\n\nThe brilliant chemical engineering graduate from\
  \ a REC, who had taken Sanyas, while not yet thirty and who roamed barefoot in the\
  \ narrow alleys of Rishikesh, all his worldly possessions bundled inside a small\
  \ jhola. The incredible gentleness in his face as he fed a banana to a stray calf.\
  \ \n\nThe Vaghya Murli couple I befriended in Nashik. They sang for me at dusk,\
  \ their cowrie shell garlands glittering dully in the twilight, their voices, plaintive\
  \ and lilting, carrying over the gently lapping waters of the Godavari, as they\
  \ sang the praises of the Goddess Bhavani. \n\nThe Saadhvi in an orange sari standing\
  \ with folded hands, tears streaming from her closed eyes as she swayed gently to\
  \ the rhythm of the Ganga Arati in Rishikesh. Seldom have I seen such serenity in\
  \ a human face. \n\nThe old Varkari walking along the annual waari; dark and enduring\
  \ like a huge boulder left to bake in the sun for years, his eyes milky with cataract.\
  \ He had been walking with the waari every year for over 40 years and his only remaining\
  \ desire in life was to die while walking on the waari! \n\nThe fiery Fakir with\
  \ matted hair at Fatehpur Sikri, the one who took one look and told me that I was\
  \ very hot-headed and stubborn. The octogenarian Sadhu who danced with the gay abandon\
  \ of a child during the evening Arati at Pashupatinath, and a bunch of other people,\
  \ traversing the mystical path. \n\nThey were not exactly monks who had sold their\
  \ Ferraris, but ordinary people who chose to take the path less travelled in search\
  \ of something that had eluded them in the course of their normal life.. Some had\
  \ their choices thrust upon them, like the Vaghya Murli, while most of the others\
  \ had chosen to follow their own inner voice.\n\nThe paths they traversed were different,\
  \ but they all had one thing in common. They radiated a serenity and contentment\
  \ that I have rarely seen in other people. They all had two things in common; a\
  \ wandering, itinerant lifestyle and few material possessions.\n\nPerhaps that is\
  \ the secret of inner peace. \n! Keep Walking!"
