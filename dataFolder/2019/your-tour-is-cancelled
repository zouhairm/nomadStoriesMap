Text: "It was our last morning in Lisbon and the November sun had greeted us with\
  \ a warm embrace. A few days had passed since we arrived and this stranger of a\
  \ city was clinging to me like a long-lost friend, trying to reel me back in with\
  \ its musings. It was completely unexpected and exceptionally brilliant. However,\
  \  I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if something ethereal was slipped into my Past\xE9\
  is de Nata to spark this feeling. Or it could just be the amount of custard that\
  \ was in my system\u2026 Fortunately, our Portuguese fairy tale would continue in\
  \ the form of Sintra. \n\nAs we made our way to greet Lu\xEDs de Cam\xF5es, we passed\
  \ Fernando Pessoa lounging in his favourite Caf\xE9 A Brasilera. The epic poets\
  \ and illustrious authors hailing from this City of Seven Hills simply added to\
  \ the magic and intrigue of our last day. I wanted to lose myself in Lisbon. To\
  \ let it swallow me whole and spit me out drenched in its reverie. \n\nWe welcomed\
  \ the expanse of Cam\xF5es Square with delight, the morning sun now showing off\
  \ as it played with the shadows of the statues, bringing them to life. \n\nWe heard\
  \ the announcement, faint, yet distinct in its delivery, as we reached the pinnacle.\
  \ \n\n\u201CYour tour is cancelled.\u201D\n\nI looked at my companion with wide,\
  \ bewildered eyes and we approached our inevitable fate. The tour to Sintra was\
  \ cancelled\u2026 what were we going to do now? \n\nThis city that had stumbled\
  \ into my life was now slipping from my grasp. \n\nI didn\u2019t want to let it\
  \ go. \n\n\u201CLet\u2019s make our own tour\u201D I haphazardly blurted out. \n\
  \nSo, I collected myself, and my thoughts whilst leaving the epic poets and illustrious\
  \ authors behind in Cam\xF5es Square and made a bee line for Rossio station. \n\n\
  I was propelled, in this haphazard blur to take a leap into the unknown. \n\nMy\
  \ excitement and intrigue had quickly muddled into a whirlwind of nerves and anticipation.\
  \ It didn\u2019t help that our train also felt an unease with the tracks, its rickety\
  \ and ageing interior starting to feel more worrisome than authentic. \n\nAs we\
  \ pulled into Sintra station the hordes of people exploded outwards, with a mission\
  \ and grandeur in their step; they knew what they were doing. Or it at least seemed\
  \ like they did. \n\nAs we spilled out onto the welcoming streets of Sintra, I had\
  \ to ensure that our train wasn\u2019t a well disguised time machine. To say it\
  \ felt like I had been transported to the 19th century would be an understatement.\
  \ I took a moment to register the conglomerate around me, the expressions of awe\
  \ confirmed the reality. \n\nThe mystery and magic of the Old Town enveloped me.\
  \ Its cobbled streets met my feet and the traditional houses shone in hues of pinks\
  \ and greens and blues. The feeling of uncertainty left me in a flash as my curiosity\
  \ turned into relief. \n\nOnce again, I felt an immense sense of propulsion. As\
  \ if my body needed to see more. \n\nAnd so I did. \n\nI was met with the enchanting\
  \ and memorising gardens of Quinta de Regaleira with its hidden tunnels and ornate\
  \ fa\xE7ade. A certain mystic that can only be felt when descending its spiralling\
  \ well. \n\nI was met with the vivid flamboyance of Palacio Nacional da Pena, romanticising\
  \ my architectural radar off its charts. It\u2019s impossible to believe that a\
  \ King isn\u2019t walking among you, ready to appear at one of the towering windows\
  \ above. \n\nI felt like I was on top of the world. Or at least on top of Sintra.\
  \ \n\nThe boldness. The mystery. The magic. \n\nFortunately Fernando Pessoa did\
  \ not realise how correct he was when he said: \u201CThe value of things is not\
  \ the time they last, but the intensity with which they occur.\u201D\n\nSintra is\
  \ a place for dreamers and believers. It is a place that deserves an unhinged exploration\
  \ into the unknown so you too can feel its incredible intensity."
