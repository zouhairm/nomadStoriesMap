Text: "It was January, 2017. After spending the majority of the previous year chasing\
  \ the sun in Latin America, my body was happy to give it a break and watch the cold\
  \ rain fall heavy from inside a cozy house in North London. My mind, however, had\
  \ already crossed the ocean back.\n\nThere I was, in a relationship of 3 years that\
  \ barely felt like it could survive another month, and a job offer to start a life\
  \ anew in Mexico. I took it. I got to Guadalajara with two suitcases filled with\
  \ clothes I never got a chance to wear, because despite Google\u2019s assurance\
  \ that the temperatures could easily get down to 2\xB0 Celsius during the night,\
  \ I never needed more than a light cardigan to go outside. Stupid Google. Stupid\
  \ weather. Stupid Mexico! With a heart overflowing with resentment and pain, I turned\
  \ Mexico into the scapegoat of all my problems.\n\nI was unhappy, I felt empty and\
  \ worst of all, I missed myself dearly. How it happened, I\u2019m still not quite\
  \ sure, but during those years in my broken relationship I had stopped doing so\
  \ many of the things I enjoyed. Where were my science books and fantasy novels?\
  \ Why were my old hiking shoes still looking brand new? Why living in new places\
  \ had lost its appeal to me?\n\nIt had to change! Or at least, that is how cool\
  \ I wish I had been, but in reality, change came slowly. I stopped sleeping in my\
  \ Uber trips and started cycling the flat streets of Guadalajara. Venturing into\
  \ its colorful pueblos I came across all sorts of dubious looking yet delicious\
  \ street food. How else would I ever know Jamaica is also the name of an edible\
  \ flower that makes for delicious vegetarian quesadillas? I made my way to the West\
  \ and fell in love with the Pacific Ocean \u2013 walking into Sayulita\u2019s clear\
  \ waters, surrounded by flickering speckles of golden sand, I couldn\u2019t ask\
  \ for more. Yet, I was gifted more, and bathed in the brightest orange skies a sunset\
  \ can paint. It was September, 2018. I remember laying down in the shades of a palm\
  \ tree, listening to the calm sea waves breaking on the shore, re-reading an old\
  \ book and realizing that, after so long, I was finally feeling happy and whole\
  \ again.\n\nHad my story finished there, we could all shed a tear over my happy\
  \ ending, but Mexico was not done with me yet. The plot twist came in the form of\
  \ a new love. I\u2019ve had a hard day at work, I threw up all my lunch, it was\
  \ late, I was hungry, too tired to cycle and Ubers were on a strike. My seemingly\
  \ best option was to ask for a ride to this colleague with whom most conversations\
  \ so far had ended in bickering and diplomatic offensive remarks about each other.\
  \ Again, I took it. On the valid argument that it\u2019d be the quickest way to\
  \ have food, he convinced me to join him for some snacks and drinks\u2026 I guess\
  \ it was a dry evening \u2013 it\u2019s always dry in Guadalajara \u2013 filled\
  \ with traffic noise and some reggeaton tunes playing around. I can\u2019t tell\
  \ for sure, though \u2013 my attention, for hours, got swept by the puzzling person\
  \ in front of me. Inadvertently, that was the beginning of my intensive lesson on\
  \ what falling in love really feels like, what it entails and the blissful moments\
  \ it can create. \n\nFast forward 5 months and here I am staring into the Pacific\
  \ Ocean again. Our work contract has ended. He\u2019s going back to the US. I\u2019\
  ll head to South Asia. It\u2019s our farewell trip.\n\nWhen I first put a backpack\
  \ on my shoulders to go see the world, I lost myself into a relationship that took\
  \ with it the beauty of the places I visited and stained my experiences to the point\
  \ I didn\u2019t feel comfortable sharing them with anybody. Mexico became my hideout,\
  \ one that I hated at first, but that with its kindness, authenticity and surprises\
  \ paved a sanctuary of peace into my mind. Once again, I\u2019m leaving with an\
  \ aching heart. This time, however, I\u2019m proud of my feelings."
