Text: "\u201C Chocolate in Colombia\u201D\n   Dark chocolate, milk chocolate, medium\
  \ chocolate, fruit and nuts dipped in chocolate, chocolate drinks is this Switzerland\
  \ or Germany? No its Colombia, Cartagena Colombia to be exact. A major stopping\
  \ point on my drive down the Pan American highway. \n    Cacao beans come from the\
  \ pods that grow on cacao trees in this beautiful South American country. As a chocolate\
  \ lover I\u2019m thrilled to be in Choco museo a tourist-oriented chocolate factory.\
  \ Tasting all the creamy chocolaty samples offered for free. I enjoy learning about\
  \ chocolate so much that I decide to come back the next day to take their 2-hour\
  \ bean to bar workshop.\n   When I arrive, I am assigned a one on one instructor.\
  \ We start with 30 dry cacao beans. We then roast them. This is the critical part\
  \ of chocolate, you can develop many flavors at this point. We take ours to a slightly\
  \ burnt smell. After peeling off the cracked outer shell we grind them in a small\
  \ mortar and pestle releasing that wonderful chocolate aroma and reducing the beans\
  \ to a dark creamy paste. This is 100% chocolate. From here there are 3 different\
  \ options you could separate into cocoa butter and cocoa powder. Or let it cool\
  \ into a bar of baking chocolate. Last, we could add cocoa butter and sugar and\
  \ make that delicious chocolate we love.\n   To experience how chocolate was consumed\
  \ centuries ago we make Mayan hot chocolate. With a pot of boiling water, we add\
  \ half of the chocolate paste we ground. Some corn flour adds a creamy thickness.\
  \ We spice it up with black pepper and chili pepper. Some anise adds flavor. To\
  \ sweeten it we add honey. We skip the blood traditionally added. It is good but\
  \ unlike anything I\u2019ve experienced before.\n   When the Spanish arrived in\
  \ the Americas and conquered the Aztecs, they modified this drink with some European\
  \ twists. This time we begin by heating milk. Add the rest of the chocolate paste.\
  \ Flavor it with cinnamon and cloves. Season it with a mere pinch of salt. Sweetness\
  \ is added with a generous dose of sugar. This is delicious much like my mother\u2019\
  s hot chocolate only with some more flavor.\n   It seems every part of the cacao\
  \ bean has a use. With the shells that were peeled off after roasting and boiling\
  \ water, we brew a bitter tea. This is called cacao tea. I add honey to mine and\
  \ enjoy it. But its definitely not something I expected to find in a chocolate shop.\n\
  \   The last part of my class is making chocolates. We use their standard 70% mix\
  \ from their factory for this. With a spoon, I fill the 12 little squares in the\
  \ mold half full the dark liquid. Next, I add flavor\u2019s like coffee beans, almonds,\
  \ chili pepper, or just plain pinch of sea salt. Fill them all to the top with chocolate\
  \ and they are ready to cool. \n   While waiting for the chocolates to cool I sit\
  \ down for dinner in the house restaurant. My instructor special orders a drink\
  \ I sampled the day before called mazatal along with a chicken sandwich. Mazatal\
  \ is delicious, served hot it consists of milk, cinnamon, cloves, cornmeal, chocolate,\
  \ and sugar. It made a delicious and satisfying meal.\n   With my now frozen chocolates\
  \ in hand and the origins of chocolate freshly stamped in my mind. I say goodbye\
  \ to a new friend and walk back out into the cobbled streets of Cartagena Colombia."
