Text: "I bought a kimchi rice triangle at Seven Eleven and took a bus to Lotte World\
  \ theme park. The highway was cluttered with tainted glass family cars. We moved\
  \ slowly alongside Han river as the sun went down. Concrete skyscrapers became ocre\
  \ and red with the last inkling of daylight. Subway trains moved across the bridges\
  \ without a sound as I arrived at Jamsil. After sundown, the trains seemed lightings\
  \ flying in the darkness. My host -Miss Kim- was waiting for me. I never found it\
  \ in me to tell her that I got confused while booking the room. I thought I would\
  \ live by myself.\nOne afternoon I decided to go for a stroll to Gangman. There's\
  \ a market inside the station. It didn't look that far, a red subway line went from\
  \ one to another on a straight line on the map Miss Kim gave me. So I got to walking,\
  \ crossing a bridge, passing endless blocks and starting to worry about my Korean\
  \ perception of size. I asked for directions. They gazed at me like the idea of\
  \ walking there was unheard of. I pushed through their skepticism. It drizzled.\
  \ I walk through contact lenses ads and karaokes. A little noodle shop had a sign\
  \ bigger than the fa\xE7ade. \nThere must have been regular street lights, I can't\
  \ remember. I just kept walking under the red neon crosses that garnish the staggering\
  \ number of protestant and catholic churches. Drunk middle-aged men walked, or gabbled\
  \ all over the sidewalk as they welcomingly pointed the directions I asked for.\
  \ Hours went by. I kept walking. Some time after 1 a.m. I arrived at Gangnam Station.\
  \ I was slightly worried that Miss Kim wouldn\u2019t approve of me getting home\
  \ late at night. \nBecause of the jetlag, I would come back to the her house to\
  \ rest. She told me her husband had died, and his sons were away for college. She\
  \ decided to rent the rooms in her house to earn extra money and feel less lonely.\
  \ The tone in her voice was sad but she talked fast and loud to hide it. I liked\
  \ that. She wanted to show her kind-hearted and caring self. But, at times, she\
  \ would ask me what was I going to write on my review slot on the website I booked\
  \ the room at. I always told her not to worry.\nMiss Kim noticed I coughed too much\
  \ so she set her alarm one hour before the time I told her I would get up to make\
  \ 'healing tea\u2019. We talked a lot about how to make it, but I couldn't tell\
  \ what it was. The taste was bitter and kind of raspy on the throat. Its deep brown\
  \ color hid the boiled chunks of what I sometimes thought of as a dactyl and some\
  \ other times a fern. After breakfast, I sat in my room. There was Samsung AC in\
  \ each area of the house, one above my bed. It was September, but I switched it\
  \ off. Miss Kim did not understand that decision.\nOur conversations felt fuzzy,\
  \ like trying to see without glasses. Still we would keep trying to understand each\
  \ other. Sometimes she would entertain me because I was struggling to speak Korean\
  \ to her, which she appreciated. It was fun talking to her. She played with her\
  \ hair in the disapproval I had foreseen -her gaze murmuring that I shouldn\u2019\
  t have gone- as I went on about the night in Gangnam. She was an expert in subtle\
  \ judgement. I wasn\u2019t offended, I think she liked that. I admired her. After\
  \ a few days, Miss Kim was waiting for me at the kitchen table. Or so I understood.\
  \ I sat with her and blabbed on."
