Text: "Puerto Vallarta, Mexico.  It was the kind of trip on which you didn\u2019t\
  \ realize reckless abandon was reckless.  Gorgeous beaches reserved for the locals.\
  \ Twisting, winding, up-hill climbs on mountains far from the typical tourist\u2019\
  s view.  Diving head first into the glassy pools of a paradise you expect as a tourist\
  \ but only find with natives.  Fish tacos in the streets, tequila a-flowing,  we\
  \ let our guides catapult us through the streets of Puerto Vallarta. Thrust over\
  \ the multitude of speed bumps meant to slow traffic but treated more as a challenge\
  \ to be bested. (\u201CThe trick is to take them one front tire at a time, then\
  \ curve your wheel around quickly so as not to ruin your vehicle!\u201D This was\
  \ the strict advice vehemently insisted upon by our friend, and amateur guide, Tomas.)\n\
  Each morning was a trip to the local market with Nicole, a transplant from Buffalo,\
  \ New York.  She was coming up on her one year anniversary there,  she spoke of\
  \  the kind locals, the delicious, fresh food, the enveloping culture.  She maneuvered\
  \ the market with a grace rarely seen in an American store.  It seemed as if this\
  \ 20-something, awkward girl I once knew was somehow more alive, more self-assured,\
  \ endearigly comfortable in her own skin despite her fledgling Spanish.  She moved\
  \ through the crowd, selecting the fresh produce and fish that we would need for\
  \ the day.  The market was a whirl of colors, fragrances and boisterous activity.\
  \   Yet it all felt so natural as Nicole conducted her transactions in the golden\
  \ morning sun.\nIn the evening we headed downtown  for a local celebration culminated\
  \ with fireworks.  In the busy city-center it was strange to be foriegn and yet\
  \ feel so welcome.  Smiles alit the parade of faces and colors,  we drank and danced\
  \ the night away. \nSoon, a long bus ride would take us out of the city to a remote\
  \ crop of cabanas in the hills, far removed from our friends and their local hospitality.\
  \  We drifted off to sleep to the soft sounds of the trees protected by a drape\
  \ of netting in a bed fit for a king.\nGreeted in the morning by a simple breakfast\
  \ just outside the cabana door, we graciously took our leave  on foot not quite\
  \ understanding how far away our next destination would be. \nAfter walking for\
  \ most of the morning we finally approached a main road. As luck would have it a\
  \ truck slowed down as we walked along. Damp with perspiration and sharing a quick\
  \ glance we quickly boarded the bed of the truck alongside several locals. In terribly\
  \ broken Spanish we attempted to explain where we were headed. \nA short time later,\
  \ as our good senses begin to kick in, we exited amid what seemed to be a general\
  \ consensus that we should remain aboard. The subsequent two hour walk to our destination\
  \ would prove that our clearly generous friends were absolutely correct.\nThe long\
  \ walk in the warm sun ended with a beachside lunch and cool beverage as we rested\
  \ our sore feet on the soft sand.  We perused and purchased wares from the local\
  \ merchants, then found our way back to our friends.\nA few idyllic days later we\
  \ were back in the bustle of a stuffy airport catching up on what we missed of the\
  \ world. Somehow, the News,  often brimming with fear and tragedy, had eluded us\
  \ during our time in Puerto Vallarta. \nOur friends had shown us how to be at home\
  \ in a place that was exotic and exhilirating."
