Text: "It was strange being here, roaming down the narrow streets of Lisbon where\
  \ Fado music echoed from every corner, I felt as though I knew the place like the\
  \ back of my hand. You used to tell me so many stories. \nThe most visible one is\
  \ the aftermath of the Earthquake in 1755 that tore the city in half. \nBuildings\
  \ were reconstructed, whilst the old charismatic, colourful buildings that survived,\
  \ remain to this day. \n\nPart of me hoped to find you here, even though today marks\
  \ 5 years since you stopped walking among men and made your way up to the Angels.\
  \ I found the Catholic Convent you mentioned, the only building on this half of\
  \ the city to have remained standing during the disaster. \n\nI made my way up to\
  \ the Lisbon castle where I could see the entire city from up above. I want to go\
  \ everywhere you ever mentioned and now I know why, this is truly breathtaking.\n\
  The famous yellow tram approached as I reached back down. I jumped on despite not\
  \ being entirely sure where it headed.\nAfter a while looking out the window, the\
  \ sights began resonating your words.\nThis time, it was the tower of Bel\xE9m,\
  \ surrounded by the sea\nthat drew me to disembark.\nOnce inside I climbed the seemingly\
  \ never-ending spiralling staircase until I reached the summit. \nThe view was majestic,\
  \ with the beaming sun falling down, reflecting across the sea. \n\nAcross the other\
  \ side there was a long building called Jer\xF3nimos, there lied the first King\
  \ of Portugal in his slumber. It was a noteworthy visit for many tourists however,\
  \ I wasn\u2019t ready to settle here, I still had so much to see.\n\nI decided to\
  \ make my way across to Sintra, the place where colourful, vibrant palaces reside\
  \ in the mountains.\nGetting there was the easy part, even if the bus struggled\
  \ to navigate across the multiple narrow turnings.\nThe hard part begins now, where\
  \ I walk the same steps he did as a child. This was among his favourite childhood\
  \ memories, getting higher from palace to palace. \n\nEvery slope I face makes me\
  \ weaker. \nEvery downturn after, makes me feel like I am flying. \nIt\u2019s a\
  \ constant swing of emotions, ranging from exhaustion to a false sense of completion.\
  \ \nThe road seems never ending! \nI occasionally stop to catch my breath, taking\
  \ a glimpse down below I can see random houses scattered across the fields.\nThere\
  \ are continuous trees aiding my path guiding me to go the right way, as the road\
  \ often splits into two paths. \nI am sure one of the roads leads back down, I have\
  \ been lucky to avoid those ones so far.\nAnother Palace visited and I am alarmed\
  \ that the next and final palace closes within an hour. \nUnsure if I can make it,\
  \ I start running up the slope. \nI hadn\u2019t done this much exercise since I\
  \ was a kid. \nThe soles of my shoes were wearing thin, and I can feel the niggling\
  \ stones rubbing against my feet.\nI wanted to stop and take a sip of water, but\
  \ time was not on my side.\n\nSo many years have gone by, but I never felt like\
  \ you left my side. I knew you wanted to come back here before you turned 30, and\
  \ today is our last chance. Just a few\u2026 More\u2026 Steps\u2026 Baby\u2026\n\
  \nThe gates will close in 5 minutes, and we just made it, I am here now my love.\
  \ At the highest point of Sintra.\nThe view is mesmerising. I can see the centre\
  \ of Lisbon from here, as well as the little villages spread across the way.\nIn\
  \ truth, there is only one beauty I wish I could see now.\nI have been preparing\
  \ for this moment for a long time, where I jump, and maybe we can be reunited once\
  \ more. However, I realise now you were with me all along, guiding me. Among angels,\
  \ you may walk but I feel you never truly left my side."
