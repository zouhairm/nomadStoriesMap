Text: "There\u2019s no harder, thus needed human right than choosing. Freely, in accordance\
  \ with your inner self. For me, deciding where to go has always been more struggling\
  \ than the journey itself... Better not providing the reasons behind this statement,\
  \ since I don\u2019t want to give ideas for good arguments on how to exculpate yourself\
  \ for not choosing to travel very often. \u2018Shame on you if travelling is one\
  \ of your last priorities on your heavy to-do list\u2019, I reprove myself from\
  \ time to time looking in the mirror. The penitential result is that of booking\
  \ a new trip. It happened not long time ago.\n\n   \t I lived in Serbia for 4 months.\
  \ I had a great experience studying in Novi Sad, visiting places around, making\
  \ friends and getting to know the language and the culture. I was already back in\
  \ Romania when I realized I have never visited Belgrade, the capital. Such an irony!\
  \ I knew the main train station so well, I had so many train connections from there,\
  \ but I\u2019ve never dared to place my foot into the city itself, to dive into\
  \ the well-known Balkans\u2019 capital. Ashamed of my omission, I planned a one-day\
  \ trip to Belgrade, which eventually transformed in the most memorable one-day trip\
  \ ever.\n\n    \tAll started with the problem of transportation, poor connections\
  \ between the two mentioned countries. My uncle and aunt decided to make my wish\
  \ come true and gave me a lift to Belgrade. We were on our way, close to the barrier,\
  \ chatting loudly and listening to music while our attention was drawn by a young\
  \ man waving at us as a signal to stop. He asked in English: \u201CDo you go to\
  \ Serbia? Could you please help me get there?\u201D \u201COf course. More, the merrier\u201D\
  . He was French, passionate traveler and nice company. I was proud to translate\
  \ for my aunt and uncle and could you imagine poor guy what an interrogatory he\
  \ had: 3 against 1, wanting to find more about his travels, his life. Two hours\
  \ flew as 10 minutes. We decided to explore the city separately and meet in the\
  \ evening for a drink. \n\n    \tThe day passed quicker than I expected. I almost\
  \ forgot the good-looking French guy. Built on hills, the city got my whole attention.\
  \ Many churches and parks, nice architecture, lots of museums and clean green spaces.\
  \ I have somewhere a list with all the sights I visited that day since my memory\
  \ is as a sieve when it comes to names and places. It was a perfect sunny day with\
  \ showers in the afternoon cooling the hot temperature. Like a miracle, my Google\
  \ maps worked as expected and I didn\u2019t get lost as usually happened. I only\
  \ regretted that Nicola Tesla\u2019s museum was closed and that I didn\u2019t have\
  \ any friends in Belgrade. I had that feeling of being a stranger in a nice welcoming\
  \ city, but unable to connect with locals.   \n\n    \tIt was at 6 pm. I was already\
  \ late for the meeting with the French guy. He wrote to me about his new acquaintance,\
  \ a Serbian guy who would give us a walk and be our guide. What could I wish more!?\
  \ The capital\u2019s people are usually looked down by ordinary Serbians outside\
  \ Belgrade as superficial, always-in-hurry individuals. My chance to make comparisons\
  \ and analyze people!\n\n    I still remember my big smile meeting my French friend,\
  \ then my shy smile while shaking hands with the handsome Serbian guy, then my shocked\
  \ silly smile realizing there were other 3 young gentlemen, all enthusiastic about\
  \ the walking tour the Serbian guy promised. I don\u2019t remember how they had\
  \ met and finished up together, but I remember my surprise about hanging out with\
  \ 5 unknown guys of whom I was the worst English speaker. The long walk and the\
  \ sunset, the good taste of burek, the deep conversations about us and people in\
  \ general, about politics, about travelling, the guys waiting with me for my belated\
  \ bus in the train station at 10 pm\u2026 all that I remember now watching our group\
  \ photo at sunset. On the back of it, my thought: \u201CChoose the right place and\
  \ right people will come along\u201D!"
