Text: "It was 3:30am when we came through the door of Graciela\u2019s home on the\
  \ outskirts of Barranquilla.\n\u201CCome, my children,\u201D she says, standing\
  \ up from the table in the dining room, where she\u2019d been sitting with her daughter.\
  \ \u201CYou must be hungry. Do you want some sopa?\u201D\nWe nodded gratefully and\
  \ Graciela placed steaming bowls of chicken soup in front of us, chunks of sweetcorn\
  \ and potato submerged in it. In breaks between eating, her daughter acts as translator\
  \ when our basic Spanish gives out.\n\u201CWe saw you at the carnival today!\u201D\
  \ I point at myself, point at my eyes, point at her, then attempt some rudimentary\
  \ salsa steps. Graciela laughs heartily.\nThat morning, in her resplendent outfit\
  \ of reds, greens, yellows and blacks, her dark hair all done up and her dress flowing\
  \ about her, she\u2019d driven us as close as we could get to the parade. We walked\
  \ the final ten minutes down dusty roads where chickens pecked and excited children\
  \ dashed from house to brightly-painted house. 100dB floods of reggaeton, salsa\
  \ and vallenato music emanated from a hundred different speaker systems. \nNothing\
  \ can prepare you for being a gringo at the carnival in Barranquilla. After much\
  \ haggling, we paid 15,000 pesos (\xA34) to get into an enclosure where the smoke\
  \ of grilling and the distinctive hiss of opening cans filled the air. The onslaught\
  \ on all senses can at times be overwhelming, as music, bright colours, smells,\
  \ local flavours, and textures combine as the city comes together for three days\
  \ of parade and fiesta. Flour is rubbed into white faces. Locals, armed with huge\
  \ cans of bubblegum-scented foam, spray it profusely, targeting the obvious travellers\
  \ with well-aimed spumes. Over the waves of music, there\u2019s whistles and yells\
  \ as patrons in the front row call for \u201Cdos Aguilas\u201D, the local Colombian\
  \ lager, or grilled sticks of meat straight off the barbecue. Ahead of us, toiling\
  \ under the sun\u2019s rays, dancers in the most garish outfits compete for attention,\
  \ showing no sign of fatigue. Float after float comes past, greeting the excited\
  \ crowds as they pass.\n\u201CThere she is!\u201D comes a cry, as we spot Graciela\
  \ among forty others, dancing around an enormous yellow bull, its horns tipped in\
  \ gold and streamers billowing. Despite the heat, the dancers\u2019 moves are in\
  \ sync, their twirls and spins beautifully-timed. She beams as she sees us. Now,\
  \ following my gringo dance moves, she\u2019s wearing that same smile.\n\u201CSi,\u201D\
  \ she says, then turns to her daughter, who translates: \u201CBut now, it\u2019\
  s time to rest. Tomorrow we do it all again.\u201D"
