Text: "It was one of the first days of our road trip around the island, we were on\
  \ our way  from Saman\xE0 to Punta Rucia, from North East to the North. The trip\
  \ was quite good, not so much traffic and the temperature was mild, even if,  my\
  \ travel partner used to turn the AC on  all the time, well, he is American , and\
  \ I,  I am Italian and allergic to AC.  \nEvery few miles we were passing by small\
  \ local villages, a bunch of houses made of wood and metal sheets but colored with\
  \ the brightest colors I've ever seen. Pink, green, yellow, almost as to show from\
  \ the outside all the joy and smiles that the  people wear on the inside of their\
  \ houses. It was a rainbow of emotions for me, a motorbike with four people on it,\
  \ a woman with mangos on her head, or teen girls walking  down the street after\
  \ school with their short pleated skirts and long socks on. Such a great local picture!\
  \ Caribbean vibes were conquisting all  of me.\nAfter two and half hours  of driving\
  \ , we reached the Punta RUcia and our hotel,  The Eco hotel, which had only four\
  \ rooms and no families allowed.  A man, Leo from Madagascar,  welcomed us. He opened\
  \ up the gate and we saw in front of us a little paradise  with a small and peacefull\
  \ private beach, two amacas and two chaise lounge in front of the sea. \u201CWow!\
  \ I want to stay here for the rest of our trip!\u201D I said. But unfortunally it\
  \ was just for that night.  It was 6 pm when we took some time to enjoy the paradise\
  \ reserved to us. Me on the amaca and my friend on the chair. I felt the water with\
  \ my feet. He was taking pictures and drinking a local rum.  We felt extremely relaxed\
  \ and in peace with all the cosmos.  \nWe planned to have dinner right there, just\
  \ outside of the hotel. About a five minute walk. My friend wanted to show me a\
  \ local pizzeria owned by an Italian man who immigrated in the Republica years ago.\
  \ It was one of the best pizzas he'd ever tasted, and I was curious to try.\nAt\
  \ 9 pm , ready and refreshed, we walked out in the dark. The street to arrive at\
  \ Lino's Pizzeria, the italian chef, was dusty and rough. My expectation was very\
  \ close to an Italian \u201Cregular\u201D pizzeria, chairs, tables  with a country\
  \ style.  Unexpectedly, what my eyes saw was a little bottega by the sea, with maybe\
  \ six plastic tables and chairs, the cheapest ones, on the sidewalk close the street.\
  \ Everything was simple but so genuinly true, like the energy Lino was putting in\
  \ the kitchen tryin to make pizza for his clients.\nAll the people out there, sounded\
  \ like his old friends : \u201C Hola Lino! Que comemos esta noche?\u201D \u201C\
  Hi Lino! What you are going to cook us tonight?\u201D.\nA girl came telling us the\
  \ pizzas were finished. It was just 9pm and there was no pizza anymore?! That surprised\
  \ us, but not so much indeed, we looked at each others eyes and we started laughing.\
  \  \u201CCan we find a solution? I want my friend to taste the good kitchen of Lino\u201D\
  , my friend said. The waitress asked Lino and the solution was, a spaghetti with\
  \ mussels and clams. It was the only choice indeed, take it or leave. Of course\
  \ we took it! We sit in one of those plastic tables. We started drinking the local\
  \ beer Presidente and listened to the music Lino\u2019s place was playing, a mexican\
  \  love song.\nThirty minutes later Lino arrived at the table bringing the whole\
  \ pan with spaghetti, two plates and a big smile. I was extremely happy to be able\
  \ to experience that magic and I couldn't wait to listen to Lino\u2019s own story."
