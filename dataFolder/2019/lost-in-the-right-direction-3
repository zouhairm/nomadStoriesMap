Text: "Write, someone told me. It was a friend. Write, again. Why? I should know why,\
  \ but the answer\u2019s never in the destination. It\u2019s in the middle. So, I\
  \ left. On 12.742 miles, I choose to stop at latitude 38 and longitude -9. I woke\
  \ up in Lisboa, my finger picked it up on the map with no particular reasons. I\
  \ was looking for something. I was looking for myself. A graffiti on the wall told\
  \ me I had to get lost, if I wanted to do it. And so, I decided to get lost in the\
  \ right direction. The first place I fell in, it was like me. A church with no roof,\
  \ a wonderer who once believed. Convento da Orma do Carmo appeared behind me after\
  \ I went to the top of Lisboa on Elevador de Santa Justa, no ashamed in its nakedness.\
  \ Not afraid of the sky. I was, I needed to be anchored to the ground. So, I ran\
  \ to Alfama. There you\u2019re in the heart of the city, but you feel like you\u2019\
  re in the sea. White walls and blue azulejos chase each other in serpentine waves\
  \ barely touching the locals\u2019 life. The air smelled like eggs, lemons and cream.\
  \ Suddenly, an old smile welcomed me speaking in a language that was different from\
  \ mine, but it was sharing the same willing: being together. Feel at home, please.\
  \ I did, it tasted like cherries. The smallest cup of ginjinha warmed my entire\
  \ body and melted all my resistance. The history written on the walls of Alfama\
  \ was the same laying between all the wrinkles of that old lady. Calluses on her\
  \ hands, wounds in her heart, hope in her eyes. Here\u2019s where the gap between\
  \ life and its sense is filled: people. Because there\u2019s something poetic in\
  \ the world, in its skylines. A square blooming among two columns facing the ocean,\
  \ mountain peaks burning behind the walls of an old castle. That\u2019s poetry.\
  \ But what, when it comes to people? Go west, and you\u2019ll meet a bunch of people\
  \ pointing at the unknown under a white sword. There, where Padr\xE3o dos Descobrimentos\
  \ lies, you can feel the willing to discover what\u2019s beyond the horizon in the\
  \ air. It\u2019s everywhere, it fills you, it pushes you. It changes you, as poetry\
  \ turns into magic.\nWrite, someone told me. I started traveling. How could I write\
  \ without moving? I should know how, but the answer\u2019s never what you expect.\
  \ It changes with you. So, I left. And, on 12.742 miles, I choose to start at latitude\
  \ 38 longitude -9."
