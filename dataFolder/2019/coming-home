Text: "My story begins with the birth of my mother in Madeira Island. The oldest of\
  \ 8 children born into an impoverished family, her life was already designed to\
  \ carrying on more of the same. Her out was to enter a convent, but being too poor\
  \ to have a dowry, which was necessary for entry, that possibility dwindled. Then\
  \ comes along my father, an American of Portuguese descent and a WWII vet, who noticed\
  \ a photograph of my mother at the home of his cousin. The two began writing to\
  \ each other with my father\u2019s bilingual cousin translating between languages.\
  \ My father eventually traveled to Madeira, married my mother, and brought her to\
  \ the US. \nMy mother often spoke of Madeira quite fondly, but had no desire to\
  \ ever go back. As I grew up, I had become quite familiar with her home town of\
  \ Campanario, and Madeira, and then the whole country of Portugal, even doing extensive\
  \ projects on it in my school years. \nOn my 40th Birthday, my sister, my daughter,\
  \ and I went to Madeira on a group tour...just to check out what my mother had often\
  \ spoken of. We took advantage of the tour visits to the other parts of the island\
  \ and did the touristy things. On our free times, armed with names of people we\
  \ had never met, and addresses that we had no idea where they were, we searched\
  \ for some connection to our mother\u2019s past. Our first connection was made at\
  \ a hairdressing shop that a distant cousin owned. She took us in with open arms,\
  \ recognizing us as I sported strong resemblances to my mother. She did our hair!\
  \  She took us out on the town! She hooked us up with other relatives who we spent\
  \ time with! They took us to the small overgrown and abandoned house that my mother\
  \ grew up in, a 2 room concrete home with a dirt floor, outhouse and no running\
  \ water. They treated us like family!  Hey, they were!  That one week vacation flew\
  \ by, but I knew it would not be my last time visiting the island. \nI have gone\
  \ back several times since then, most recently staying for 3 weeks at an aunt\u2019\
  s house. I stayed as a local this last time, taking local buses to get around, shopping\
  \ at the markets or from the mobile units who would sell fish, bread, or produce\
  \ out of the back of their trucks and cooking at home. I went on a levada walk.\
  \ I went to festivals where streets were decorated with paths of live flowers, and\
  \ followed processions through the towns, culminating at a church, then ate and\
  \ listened to music and danced into the night. \nI always felt welcomed whenever\
  \ I went somewhere on the island. Even though I was a foreigner, obvious by my accent\
  \ and American dress, I felt very much welcomed and at home in Madeira. The years\
  \ of my mother\u2019s stories, even though I had not remembered exact details, had\
  \ provided me with a comfort like a blanket that warmed me and made me feel like\
  \ I fit in. \nI do travel a lot all over the world, and have yet to feel the connection\
  \ that I have made with my roots, in Madeira Island. The climate is always temperate\
  \ year round, the mountains and sea scenery is not to be compared, the flora and\
  \ fauna are unique and beautiful, and the life pace is laid back and comfortable.\
  \ I\u2019m not sure I\u2019d like to live there, but as far as a vacation destination,\
  \ I\u2019m not sure why more people don\u2019t try Madeira.with the exception of\
  \ these resorts that are popping up mostly along the coasts, much of the island\
  \ is still unspoiled.  It surely does live up to one of its nicknames of \u2018\
  The Floating Garden\u2019."
