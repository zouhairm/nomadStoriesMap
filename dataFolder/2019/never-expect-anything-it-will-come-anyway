Text: "\"Don't expect something on life\" that was what my Mexican best friend told\
  \ me all the time, because truly he said it would disappoint ourselves, just let\
  \ it flow and see what's in front of you. \n\nHe knew that I always expecting and\
  \ dreaming to meet a foreign lover, to travel with him, to exploring the city with\
  \ motorbike, to swimming on the beach and starring the sunset, trying new foods,\
  \ having an amazing night in a beautiful resort and so on.. But since I expected\
  \ too much I never could achieve ANY OF THEM, I feel inconsolable inside.\n\nAfter\
  \ a while trying to force myself, I finally can get use to stop expecting things\
  \ on my mind, and the miracle is come by itself, seriously it was a miracle. \n\
  October 2017, as I remember it was the first time I 'met' this European guy online\
  \ in an application, I bravely said met even though we never touch each other's\
  \ hands. I feel something like love on him only by text, I feel he speaks my heart\
  \ only by his words, I feel he always beside me, hug me, and kiss me towards the\
  \ emojis, I feel in love and loved by him deeply. \n\nAfter some time talking we\
  \ found a fact that we both do love to travel.\nI said to him \"come here if you\
  \ want to meet me, I couldn't meet you on your country and I don't want to travel\
  \ alone to the place you mentioned before\". He was worried though, he said, after\
  \ that I was just thinking that he won't come and I can't hope anything. \n\nSix\
  \ months later, suddenly he called me to show his flight ticket coming to Indonesia!\
  \ Oh my Lord, I was so happy, shock, nervous, I feel like I was winning a big prize!\
  \ \n\nThis guy is finally came out through the exit door of my airport, with the\
  \ luggage and his backpack, he looks the same on the picture, \"luckily. Yes it's\
  \ him\" said my heart (fyuh). He rans to me, I feel stuck seriously, but I walk\
  \ faster to him, we finally hug each other, kissed and cry, because I was sooo happy!\n\
  \nAs I've told you before, we both love to travel. From Jakarta the journey as a\
  \ couple has begun. We took a bus to Bandung to my city, and then flight to Yogyakarta\
  \ to see and to feel the traditionally vibe over there, eating foods he never ate\
  \ before, exploring the city with motorbike \"ah it was what I dreaming of, it's\
  \ happenning now\" my mind said while hugging him tighter from the back. To realize\
  \ more dreams of mine, we took a flight to Bali yes the most famous city and island\
  \ of my country. To spending days swimming on the beach, looking the sunset, having\
  \ some party like youth does, showering under waterfalls and stay in a perfect resort\
  \ with beach as our view, was so romantic. \nSince we still miss each other, we\
  \ decided to go to Malaysia to feel another different vibes of Melayu people anc\
  \ culture, we spent days there by exploring with a train, trying local foods, and\
  \ visiting a lot of cultural places, museums, castles, historical places and etc.\
  \ It's not finish yet, we continue the journey to Singapore, the hottest place I've\
  \ been in South East Asian, i hate the heat for God's sake. But I love their Chinese\
  \ foods, snacks, drinks, their modern things, their quite roads, their clean country,\
  \ and their amazing night vibe! \nUnfortunately the journey has to be end after\
  \ 3 weeks we spent times together, I didn't expect anything, I didn't ask him to\
  \ meet again because I won't hope and expect anything yes. We say goodbye with big\
  \ hearts, we will work things out better in future, and to keep in touch always.\n\
  \nI'm so happy I already fulfilled some of my dreams, (I still have more ofcourse)\
  \ they are really coming true when we don't expect things. Believe me, just trust\
  \ your heart, follow everything what you need to do, let it flow, and stop expecting,\
  \ don't worry, beautiful things will come out in the right time."
