Text: "As I promised myself in the plane from Bordeaux to Berlin, I will accept whatever\
  \ my roommates for 2 weeks will suggest. So, five days later, here I am, on a sunday\
  \ night, asking one of my new friends for a beanie to protect my hair from the upcoming\
  \ heat : today, I am trying a hidden, and naked, sauna for the first time.\n\nAs\
  \ I follow my friends into the yellow-ish subway, I discover that I am going to\
  \ a gas station, behind which is a semi-itinerant sauna, consisting in a Tibetan\
  \ yurt with antique flour bags as couches, a Finnish sauna in a trailer, a barrel\
  \ on fire in the middle of a small yard, and, on the side an iced shower with an\
  \ equally cold bath. Very hidden indeed. I cannot see anything from outside even\
  \ though nothing is closed.\nI have never been to a naked sauna or been out in an\
  \ open and urban area in my birthday suit. So, as I undress in the yurt and put\
  \ on flip-flops and my beanie as my only shields against the february Berlin cold\
  \ to go to the little wooden trailer, I weigh in on how much of an uncomfortable\
  \ situation I am putting myself into. \nThe cold creeps in as I open the door of\
  \ the yurt and hastily tip toe to the trailer to escape the soft rain. I find a\
  \ little spot in this insanely hot and tiny cabin. Here are three Spanish people,\
  \ a Swedish man, a Romanian one, several Italians, two Germans. I try to get used\
  \ to the burning air, the dim light, the foggy atmosphere, my own body, trying to\
  \ engage into conversations, because people are chatting. My skin starts to drip\
  \ with sweat and I can\u2019t really decide if focusing on being naked makes me\
  \ less or more sensitive to the heat. I am in a peaceful inferno. Someone puts another\
  \ log in the stove, I now need to put my head over my lap to cool off a little bit\
  \ and accept my lack of a bathing suit. My skin is now plasticine, but it is not\
  \ unpleasant anymore.\n\nI learn that this sauna moves sometimes, since the yurt\
  \ is a real, traditional one, and the trailer still has its wheels. For now, it\
  \ has settled in a somewhat posh area of the German capital, where nobody can see\
  \ it. Its owner is a middle-aged German man with a soft spot for Indian music playlists.\n\
  Two Spanish girls start to sing, their friend accompanies them with an upbeat, wavy\
  \ rythm. They are light and quite energetic for people moving in a 70\xB0C heat.\
  \ They sometimes stop to chat with us all and languages switch in the middle of\
  \ sentences, from Spanish to German, from French to Italian, from anything to English.\
  \ \n\nIt is now advised, I am told, to plunge into the icy bath and  run back to\
  \ the trailer. So I get out, borrow some uncannily big flip-flops in front of the\
  \ trailer, dizzily wobble to the bath under the rain and plunge, head included,\
  \ particularely proud of my motivation to face this thermical shock.\n-Holy crap\
  \ !\nThis idea was such a terrible one...\nI yank myself out of the bath like a\
  \ cat whose owners just turned on the vacuum, swearing in languages foreign even\
  \ to myself and run back to the trailer as a couple, warming up around the barrel\
  \ in the center of the yard, salutes my braveness. \nThe sauna is now full. So,\
  \ we go out to gather around the fire. Drops fall into the barrel, but the rain\
  \ is not freezing us anymore. The discreet decaying aspect of the yard feels quite\
  \ comforting. This place is simple, functionnal, warm. \nIt is now around 10.00\
  \ PM and we are all gathered in the yurt, around the stove, asking the owner about\
  \ the place, which he answers with amusement and a bit of pride. We share Chinese\
  \ tea. In this ageless round cabin, I feel like a temporary multicultural home actually\
  \ introduced me to what it is like to have a body in Germany."
