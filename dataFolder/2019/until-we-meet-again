Text: "The most earth shattering year of my life occurred at 28 years of age. In 2015,\
  \ my father passed away after a brave fight with bladder cancer, I sat on the sidelines\
  \ in my own romantic saga as I watched my relationship with my boyfriend dissipate,\
  \ and I left my corporate job of 8 years to pursue my heart and love for small business.\
  \ As if I had any energy left to give, I saw an email that sparked my interest and\
  \ grabbed my attention. The subject line read: Spend two weeks in Honduras with\
  \ a Habitat build. \n\nWhy this particular email caught my attention, I will never\
  \ know, but it did. I loved to travel and to find my way among other cultures, and\
  \ with all of the heartache and change in my life, I thought this could be a good\
  \ way to clear my head and focus on things other than myself. \n\nIn literally four\
  \ days, I was not only registered to go, I found myself packing for a trip to the\
  \ jungle of Honduras to help build houses with Habitat for Humanity.  \n\nThe night\
  \ I packed my suitcase, I sat next to my bedroom window and observed something that\
  \ I have observed out windows and in the fresh, crisp air of the night hundreds\
  \ of times before. The Little Dipper.  Something about the Little Dipper reminded\
  \ me of the innocence of my childhood. I use to find the Little Dipper everywhere\
  \ we traveled and often outside my childhood house that was among the North\u2019\
  s Carolina countryside.  It\u2019s something that I forgot about as an adult but\
  \ the night I packed my suitcase, that Little Dipper  shined out my window almost\
  \ wanting me to notice it. \n\nAs I headed off on an adventure to Honduras, finding\
  \ that Little Dipper in the dark of the night in the jungle bungalow I called home\
  \ for two weeks, among frogs croaking and mosquitoes buzzing, was just what I needed\
  \ to regain myself.\n\nI spent the next two weeks among the most amazing people\
  \ I have ever met. The people of Honduras are the most humbling, kind and hardworking\
  \ people I have ever met. I worked physically harder during those two weeks than\
  \ I had ever worked before. I spent the days digging trenches, setting rebar and\
  \ making cement. I ate the most amazing jungle foods and watched iguanas run by\
  \ my hotel bungalow at night that were larger than my dog. I waited until the sun\
  \ went behind the mountains in the distance to search out those special stars at\
  \ night. And they never disappointed. As I sat at night among the other Habitat\
  \ group chatting about our day and our families back home, I shared my story and\
  \ what brought me to this trip. \n\nHaving those moments at night with new friends,\
  \ among this new country to me was liberating. Each day of this trip I felt more\
  \ and more revitalized and one to what was to come when I returned home. \n\nAs\
  \ two weeks flew by, I returned home to my house. As I spent the next few days unpacking,\
  \ I found myself remembering how I felt before my trip. I never knew how much travel\
  \ could bring a new sense of direction, purpose, value. Sure enough it did all of\
  \ those things and more.  \n\nTonight, I sit here, four years after my first trip\
  \ to a Honduras, I look out my bedroom window, seeking those special little stars\
  \ that connect me to the most amazing, transformational two weeks of my life.  Until\
  \ we meet again, Honduras."
