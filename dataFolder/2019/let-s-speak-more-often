Text: "This isn't a travel story. It's a stream of consciousness, prompted by travel\
  \ that seeks to explain the comfort felt by muslim travelers when they hear the\
  \ sound of Adhan (call to prayer) on their return home.\n\nTravel is essential for\
  \ an understanding of what we see as \u201Cother\u201D, for an attempt to bring\
  \ ourselves closer to it and to bring our learning home. Through out the ages, that\u2019\
  s what our ancestors have done. Travel was one of the most crucial elements of the\
  \ golden age of Islam, wherein trade routes made exploration possible.  Movement\
  \ was key in the shift of mindset and in growth. Travel has always also been vital\
  \ for an understanding of the self. It all still holds true today.\n\nMost of us\
  \ feel this intrinsic need to go beyond ourselves and our borders. I was pulled\
  \ first towards the United States. The US has always been adept at marketing. I\
  \ already knew so much about the cities I visited that it was almost like watching\
  \ a live-action film of a childhood cartoon. It gave tangibility to what I\u2019\
  d already heard, learnt and experienced through different channels\u200A, thanks\
  \ to Hollywood.\n\nBut what I discovered was how little the other side knows about\
  \ us. This is not a challenge directed at the West. Perhaps this is a shame on us.\
  \ How can we get better at portraying how we really are?\n\nAmongst the people I\
  \ met in my travels, they always had more questions than I did about where I lived.\
  \ The idea they began with was monumentally different from the impression I tried\
  \ to give through my responses. Yes, I do wear what I\u2019m wearing here over there.\
  \ Yes, I do drive. It is safe. We have a Starbucks almost on every corner. We have\
  \ a lot of Americans, in fact.\n\nAside from not being aware of the details, people\
  \ also tended not to see the Middle East, Subcontinent, etc as a sum of many parts,\
  \ parts that look vastly different from each other at times. \n\nWhen we try our\
  \ hand at proactivity, conversation can put an end to misconceptions. Dialogue is\
  \ the easiest and most effective way to exchange learning, and there is a unique\
  \ pleasure in conversing with those who are not like you at all. But often, we don\u2019\
  t bother.\n\nAppearing remotely Muslim on the streets of bustling metropolises and\
  \ small suburbs can earn you looks. In the cold, when my mother put a scarf around\
  \ her head, we suddenly got a lot more attention. I was in Tbilisi with a close\
  \ friend from Dubai, who recoiled when I said Salam Alaikom out loud. She was terrified\
  \ someone might misinterpret the peace greeting. I\u2019m not sure if people are\
  \ actually afraid of us. But I\u2019m sure we are afraid of people being afraid\
  \ of us. We are afraid of silent misconceptions, which are more probable than manifestations\
  \ of racism. It stems from not being known. It\u2019s frustrating that someone would\
  \ know nothing about your daily life, about the ambitions of your small cities,\
  \ or the outlook of your large ones, and already have sort of made some large connections\
  \ about you and your identity. Muslim. Backwards, for sure. Dangerous, possibly.\n\
  \nEven if they haven\u2019t\u200A\u2014\u200Aeven if they\u2019re on holiday as\
  \ well and actually live only a street behind your neighborhood mosque--\u200Awe\u2019\
  ve already assumed that they\u2019ve assumed those things, and this chokehold of\
  \ stereotyping sucks.\n\nSo after \u201Cfeeling\u201D scrutinized by strangers,\
  \ we go ahead and do our shopping. We go see all the sights. When we speak to a\
  \ friendly local, we assume he or she is more open-minded than his or her peers\u200A\
  \u2014\u200Aand they assume the same about us.\n\nBut the truth may be that we\u2019\
  re all closed until the moment we open our mouths. So let\u2019s speak more often.\n\
  \nWe love the solace of coming home after a wonderful trip, and sighing with relief\
  \ at the sound of the call to prayer. Religious or not, what we\u2019re actually\
  \ deriving comfort from is the sense of being understood. The relief from having\
  \ to interpret\u200A\u2014\u200Awrongly or rightly\u200A\u2014\u200Aglances from\
  \ strangers. The relief of having nothing to prove simply because it\u2019s already\
  \ well-known."
