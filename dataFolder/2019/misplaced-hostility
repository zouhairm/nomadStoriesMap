Text: "\u201CYou have to take off\u201D, a small-nosed lady with hair tightly secured\
  \ in a pony tail, repeats over and over. \u201CI can\u2019t\u201D, I shake my head.\
  \ She shrugs unsympathetically and emphasizes, \u201CYou have to take off or you\
  \ don\u2019t pass\u201D.  I shake my head.\n\nShe looks over to her co-worker on\
  \ the adjacent counter and explains the situation while pointing to the picture\
  \ on my Canadian passport which has a picture of me in my headscarf. Her co-worker\
  \ replies in fast Spanish that I have to take my headscarf off in order to pass\
  \ customs. I shake my head apologetically.\n\nWith this, the officer lady takes\
  \ my passport and motions for me to follow her. She guides me to a room with a security\
  \ guard and starts to leave with my passport. I yell after her to give my passport\
  \ back. Left alone with the security, I am asked to sit down. I ask the guard about\
  \ what is going on and he replies, \u201CNo English\u201D. From the limited Spanish\
  \ I know, I reply this time, \u201C\xBFQue pasa?\u201D He smiles ruefully, shakes\
  \ his head and asks me to sit down again. Not wanting to cause a scene, I sit down\
  \ but ask again, \u201CQue pasa? Where is my passport? I need to know\u201D. He\
  \ replies to each of my questions with a shush and then, \u201CNo English\u201D\
  .\n\nI am already in tears by now as I start to panic. The guard pretends to ignore\
  \ me by shuffling his papers. I hesitate before standing up again and start moving\
  \ towards the guard. He eyes me from the corner of his eyes, \u201CSit down\u201D\
  . \u201CWhere is my passport?\u201D, I keep repeating. He ignores my question, \u201C\
  Sit down\u201D.\n\nWith my hand now shaking violently, I take the handle of my carry-on\
  \ and wheel it back to the seats. I contemplate sitting but decide against it. The\
  \ guard looks up from his papers and orders me to sit down one last time. A couple\
  \ of friends, perplexed by the situation, are being ushered away as they try to\
  \ peer into the room where I am seated. A couple of others are completely oblivious\
  \ to the situation, or if they know, they do not want to get involved. Still shaking,\
  \ I began to really cry. I am on my own in a foreign country, being detained before\
  \ I set foot.\nI am unsure how long I sat there crying, until the small-nosed lady\
  \ appears again with my passport. She motions for me to follow her and silences\
  \ me when I ask where. Not wanting to upset her further, I follow. We stand face-to-face\
  \ outside the room and she holds my passport in front of me, \u201CWhen you come\
  \ to a country, you need to forget your culture and do what we say, understand?\u201D\
  \ Not sure what she means, I stare at her wiping my tears. She hands me my passport\
  \ and leaves.\n\nThe couple of my friends that waited are straighten up as they\
  \ see me come out. One of my friends guides me toward the exit, as the other one\
  \ takes hold of my suitcase, \u201CLet\u2019s go, you\u2019re going to be okay.\u201D\
  \ Rattled, shaken and afraid of this foreign place I had just landed in, I follow\
  \ them outside to look for a taxi."
