Text: "Hi, Meet again with me, Brianika\nIn this episode, I want to tell you about\
  \ I and my friends named Salam Ransel Group of Backpackers, short trip in Jogjakarta.\
  \ Yup, Indonesia. What is there in your mind when you want to go to Jogjakarta?\
  \ Borobudur? This temple is indeed one of the icons when the destination is aimed\
  \ at Jogjakarta. \n\nHowever, this time skip to go to Borobudur. We want to try\
  \ according to the new one. Yes, our choice is on the Lava Tour. A tour that takes\
  \ us to explore Mount of Merapi. This destination does not require a lot of time.\
  \ Nor does it take a full day. Just a few hours is enough. Many choices of agents\
  \ who provide package variants of this tour. It can be adjusted according to your\
  \ wishes. We also chose a tour (package with a jeep rental), which cost 600 thousand\
  \ rupiah for a car. One car can be filled with up to 5 people. \n\nThe trip starts\
  \ at 4:00 with a meeting point that has been adjusted to the agent you choose. So,\
  \ you can estimate your own departure at what time you are from the hotel. Why is\
  \ it so early? The Lava tour does provide a sensation of enjoying the sunrise, guys,\
  \ yeah.\n\nOh, until I forget. Just remember it. You use an outfit according to\
  \ conditions. Trip to the mountain. Surely you will find cold temperatures. You\
  \ should use warm clothes and jackets. Bring other needs that are needed. Don't\
  \ get the clothes wrong. Unless your goals are different.\n\nThe journey from jeep\
  \ rental to the destination takes around 30 minutes. Quite a while, but it's pretty\
  \ hard to make the adrenaline run. The route doesn't twist. But the streets are\
  \ turbulent (you must know what I mean) this makes it exciting. Sometimes I jumped\
  \ from my seat because the road was so turbulent. But still be careful and safe.\
  \ During our jeep ride, we were also equipped with the use of anti-storm helmets.\
  \ \n\nRight-left view, it was still dark while traveling that morning. But once\
  \ approaching the sunrise point location, there was a glimmer of light. So beautiful.\
  \ That's the sign that you've arrived at the location of the first tour. There,\
  \ you can enjoy the beautiful sunrise. Can all take photos. When the atmosphere\
  \ of the sun rises, a photo of the silhouette is pretty guys. Photos like this can't\
  \ be taken at any time. But it was only a few minutes while the sunlight was still\
  \ orange-yellow and the sky was still dark. When the sun has risen up, the story\
  \ is different. \n\nAfter that, we were invited to tour the Kaliadem Bunker. There,\
  \ you like going back tens of years while still in colonialism. This bunker became\
  \ one of the hiding places of ancient invaders. That said, many died here. It is\
  \ really cool. Indeed, when I go inside, the weather is really different. Dark and\
  \ the air intensity decreases. So don't be long. No need to take photos too long\
  \ too. It's also dark. It looks nothing. \n\nThe next destination is Alien Stone.\
  \ What, are there aliens? I don't. It's just an alien, but that doesn't mean there\
  \ are aliens there. By the way, if there are aliens there, what do you want to do?\
  \ I have just kidding. \n\nAccording to our tour guide, the alien name is actually\
  \ from the Javanese language, is Alihan. Stone as high as approximately 2 meters\
  \ is a volcanic rock that was thrown from the mountain to the area when the eruption\
  \ in 2010 ago. \n\nWell because the stone is seen as a human face, so it's called\
  \ an Alien stone. But indeed the alien face looks like a human face?. Already forget\
  \ it. That's a name also for branding so that visitors are more interested in traveling\
  \ here. You can take pictures there as much as you like with the Alien Stone background.\
  \ Calm, safe. Don't eat people too.\n\nHow? Fun is not it? Unfortunately, we also\
  \ have to end this tour."
