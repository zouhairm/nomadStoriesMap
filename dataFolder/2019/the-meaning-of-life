Text: "I  was  trying  to  be  happy  about  my   existence  by  daydreaming  on \
  \ a  lazy  day  when  I  got  a  call  from  my  best friend  who  had  come  up\
  \  with  a  fresh  idea  to  overcome  his  OCD and anxiety issues.  He  had  decided\
  \  to  take  his  life  and indeed  wanted  to  go  out  in  style  for  which \
  \ he  was  asking  for  a  gun.  With  my  spine  erect,  I  began  to  lie  to\
  \  him  of  how beautiful  the  day  is  when  I  failed  to  drown  his  disposition\
  \ in  humour.  I  thought  it\u2019d  be  better  if  I  meet  him  and  give him\
  \  a  inspirational  discourse,  so  I  asked  him  for  an  overnight  trip.  I\
  \  thought  it  would  be  sufficient  to  cheer him  up  and  maybe  myself  too.\n\
  Chail  is  an idyllic  little  Himalayan  town  which  often  draws  a  variety\
  \  of  tourists.  It  boasts  of  holding  in  it  the highest  cricket  ground\
  \  in  the  world  and  a  classic  royal palace.  It  possesses  all  the  traits\
  \  that  make  it  a  place  for  thrill  as well  as  peace  seekers.  The  forests\
  \  in  the  area  defiantly  puts  one  in a  soothing  tone  throughout  his  wanderings.\
  \  \nOur  plan  for  the  night  was  to  dine  with  adventure.  And  there I \
  \ was,  sitting  under  the  trees,  watching  the  stars  and warming  myself \
  \ from  the  fire  we  had  ignited.  My  friend was  busy munching  on  raw  meat\
  \  at  the  bonfire  which  he  claimed  to  be  his  childhood dream.  There  was\
  \  silence,  complete  silence.  I  was  lying  down on  the  grass,  listening\
  \  Sufi  songs  and  watching  fire  sparks rise  and  descend  into  thin  air.\
  \  As  if  they\u2019re  trying  to  reach to  the  glorious  stars  above,  but\
  \  just  can\u2019t.  I  look  at  my friend  and  think  of  him  quite  the  same.\
  \  I  always  start  feeling  more  responsible when  he  utters \"anxiety is hell\"\
  .  I  wonder  did  life  create  us  or  do  we  create  life,  everyday.  These\
  \  pensive thoughts  left  my  hand  when  my  eyes  met  two  eyes  watching  us\
  \ from  a  distance.  We  had  the  dreaded  the  thought  of encountering  wild\
  \  animals  when  we  were  looking  for  a  place  to spend  the  night.  The \
  \ owner  of  the  hotel  we  had  checked  in  had warned  us  to  not  stay  out\
  \  late.  But  we  were  not  there  to sleep  in  a  hotel  room.  My  friend \
  \ said  had  he  not  been  struck by  his  psychological  troubles  he  wouldn\u2019\
  t  be  feeling  afraid  wandering  in  the night.  I  was  probably  more  afraid.\
  \  The  fear  we  had  suppressed came  up  when  that  wild  cat  had  appeared\
  \  out  of  nowhere.  It went  down  again  when  we  saw  how  cute  it  looked\
  \  biting  the meat  we  fed  it.  After  that  the  real  terror  began.  Something\
  \ diverted  the  cat\u2019s  attention  away  from  us  and  our  food.  It just\
  \  sat  straight  looking  constantly  in  a  singular  direction  as  if  something\
  \  is  there,  as  if  it  is coming  towards  us.  Somehow,  I  don\u2019t  know\
  \  how,  but  somehow  we knew  it  was  wild  predator.  And  seeing  a  glance\
  \  of  two  eyes  shine  in   the  dark  for  a  minute  sanctified  it.  \"Are\
  \  you  afraid  of  dying\" was  my  friend\u2019s  question  when  I  asked  him\
  \  what  to  do.  \nWe  thanked  God  when  we  reached  our  hotel  room  at  2\
  \  am.  Fear began  evaporating  gradually.  This  was  the  first  time  I realized\
  \  how  attached  I  am  to  living, to  just  being  alive.\nNext  morning  we\
  \  told  each  other  the dreams  we  had. I  asked  him  if  he  was still  adamant\
  \  about  taking  his  life  to which  his  expressions  subtly  conveyed that \
  \ he  wasn't  sure. \nAs  we  were  about  to  board  the  bus that  would  take\
  \  us  back  to  our  homes,my  friend  stopped, sighed  and  said  that  we  just\
  \  walk  and  walk and  catch  a  lift  only  when  we  can't walk anymore.  I \
  \ smiled.  How  could  I  refuse  this. It  was  a  beautiful  day."
