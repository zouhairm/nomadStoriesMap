Text: "When you travel there are times when you think to yourself:\n\n \u201CWhy am\
  \ I doing this?\u201D \n\nThese questioning moments can materialise in airports,\
  \ waiting at borders, on long bus rides or in fact at any point of your journey.\
  \ On a recent South East Asia trip, whilst traversing the Island of Java, it happened\
  \ to me in a cold dark hotel room. \n\nWe had spent all the previous day, travelling\
  \ by car from Yogyakarta, East towards Bali, before we turned south and stated to\
  \ climb. Our Destination was Mont Bromo, one of many active volcanoes within Indonesia.\
  \ We climbed until we reached our lodgings for the night, which because of the very\
  \ late hour seemed closed. Our driver assured us all would be well and sure enough\
  \ the door was open and a note with a key sat on a table.\n\nThe note said:\n\n\
  \ \u201CWelcome, breakfast at 4 am\u201D \n\nI let out a groan, as it was already\
  \ well past midnight. There was no food to be seen, but a nocturnal looking employee\
  \ arrived to sell us an overpriced Bintang beer. It is surprisingly easy to find\
  \ beer In the worlds largest Muslim nation.\n\nBeer polished off, we went in search\
  \ of our room and crashed out , 2 minutes later, my alarm went off and I had my\
  \ \u201CWhy am I doing this?\u201D moment, but travelling broadens the mind, apparently,\
  \ so we dressed and went in search of what I knew would be a disappointing breakfast.\n\
  \nIt was still pitch black and very cold at 4 am, we were glad we packed for the\
  \ trip, even though Indonesia is in the very low latitude numbers, predawn at 2000\
  \ m is still very cold.\n\nBreakfast was a plastic wrapped \u201Ccroissant\u201D\
  \ and 2 cold, hard boiled eggs left on a table, hardly the breakfast of champions,\
  \ but certainly one for weary, hungry travellers! \nI went in search of my morning\
  \ coffee fix and was still searching in vain, when an old Toyota 4x4 arrived. \n\
  \nWe joined a Japanese couple in the 4x4, who seemed to be dressed for the beach,\
  \ and the girl in particular eyed my down jacket with envy, in-between bouts of\
  \ shivering.\n\nWe drove for half an hour or so until we were dumped in a car park\
  \ of other Toyotas, and told to walk to the view point, and await the sun. \n\n\
  Of course this being South East Asia we were immediately surrounded by people selling\
  \ us \u201Cstuff\u201D mainly Chinese rubbish, but there was also coffee sellers!\
  \ I bought a cup, it tasted of caffeine infused mud, but it was hot, and I was happy(ier).\n\
  \nSo here we stood, and we saw nothing, but we heard the roar, a deep roar, the\
  \ roar of our planet growing!\n\nSlowly the sun returned for its trip across these\
  \ particular skies and very couple of minutes, the new day, revealed more of the\
  \ beauty that is the Tengger Caldera of Mt Bromo and the volcanic cone, that was\
  \ now steaming and roaring within it. As the light changed so did the colours and\
  \ shadows, only the roar was constant.\n\nNo amount of images of this place, prepares\
  \ you for this sunrise reveal, this stunning volcano, with its backdrop of even\
  \ more volcanoes, dominated by the massive, smoking Mt Semeru, is without doubt\
  \ one of the most beautiful places that I have ventured. \n\nWe shared this experience\
  \ with around 250 other travellers and even more hawkers, so it is far from an undiscovered\
  \ gem, but it is still a magical place.\n\nIt was at this point that I had another\
  \ moment, a moment you often encounter as a regular traveller:\n\n \u201CI am so\
  \ lucky to experience this\u201D \n\nThis is the complete opposite of the negative\
  \ \u201Cwhy am I doing this?\u201D and is also 20 times more powerful, powerful\
  \ enough to keep me packing my rucksack year after year.\n\nAnd the morning wasn\u2019\
  t over, we were now going into the caldera and walk to the active caldera to stare\
  \ into the depths of the earth.\n\n I Love Travelling.\n\nLater\u2026."
