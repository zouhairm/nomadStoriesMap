Text: "Organized all-inclusive group travel is not my forte. This one had it all flights,\
  \ hotels, food, excursions, local guides, yet the proposal by a dapper British gentleman\
  \ on the 30th floor of a New York skyscraper was an offer I could not. \u201CWhen\
  \ do I leave\u201D I burst out. \n\nDays later, the midnight breeze coming off the\
  \ Persian Gulf hit me like a hot wet towel. The morning after a jetlagged group\
  \ of strangers assembled in a hotel conference room. There were communicators to\
  \ keep our lines to the world open, medics just in case, probably a spook or two\
  \ but the majority was an all-star team of international rocket scientists. As the\
  \ team photographer, I felt lucky having banana peeled into the situation. \n\n\
  Preparations ensued, blood groups were determined; call sign lists compiled, radio\
  \ procedures briefed, safety discussed and next of kin designated. With logistics\
  \ sorted out the team bussed to an innocuous villa. All electronics left behind\
  \ before we stepped into what should have been the living room. Instead, rows of\
  \ chairs faced a pull-down screen. The briefer projected black and white line drawings\
  \ alongside greyscale aerial photographs of building complexes sprinkled across\
  \ a desert landscape. I the newbie tried to make sense of it, comments and answers\
  \ from the experts filled in the gaps.   \n\nOn the morning of departure, the team\
  \ were as mentally prepped and ready as one could be heading into the unknown. Suitcases,\
  \ water, radios, satellite communications equipment, medical equipment, MRE provisions\
  \ were loaded up the backstairs of a chartered Tupolev.  As doors closed and the\
  \ aircraft careened down the runway years of stale papyroschy smoke reeked off the\
  \ seating replacing the salty Gulf air.  If this was unpleasant what lay beneath\
  \ was a manmade disaster. Here and there a glimpse of an orange flame below the\
  \ billowing black smoke from burning oil wells.     \n\nFurther North U\u2013shaped\
  \ revetments pockmarked the ground, a few with charred vehicle remains followed\
  \ by patches of farmed green ground contrasting the beige sandy drab. We were in\
  \ country escorted by fighter jets. As we descended a landscape filled with rounded\
  \ buildings some with pinpoint holes through the roof others just rubble.  Our approach\
  \ was blocked by trucks parked across the runway. The narrower taxiway became the\
  \ landing strip and as we touched down the pilot hit the break hard skidding the\
  \ aircraft until we rolled onto a hardstand for a complete stop. \n \nArmed only\
  \ with documents, diagrams and knowledge but backed by the world we deplaned to\
  \ be greeted by several moustached men.  At a distance, a ring of soldiers with\
  \ Kalashnikovs looked on.  In a room with thick curtains and a ceiling fan which\
  \ spun dust around and around, we waited for visa processing. The country\u2019\
  s president looked down on us from the wall as we presented the task to our counterparts.\n\
  \nAs our mission begun I starred through the bus window into the eyes of another\
  \ presidential portrait, a president who had invaded two of his neighbours and ordered\
  \ the killing of thousands in a dozen years.  He in winter coat and fur hat waved\
  \ at an imaginary crowd, whilst I sweated bullets in the summer heat. At our first\
  \ stop, leather jacket clad, sunglass-wearing and packing minders lead the bus into\
  \ a sprawling military base on the outskirts of the capital. The rocket scientists\
  \ left the bus. I grabbed my camera bag and joined the United Nations Weapons Inspection\
  \ team in Iraq to destroy Saddam Hussein\u2019s Weapons of Mass Destruction."
