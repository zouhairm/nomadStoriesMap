Text: "Handing over my hard-earned Sol, just to take a picture, I realized I was contributing\
  \ to the exploitation of young children.   Mothers, their children and baby llamas\
  \ are dressed in brightly colored traditional Peruvian costumes, standing on the\
  \ street corners of Peru waiting for a tourist to provide them with their next meal.\
  \  Sometimes they wait all day, keeping their children out of school to provide\
  \ for their family.  As a single mother myself, wouldn\u2019t I do whatever is necessary\
  \ to provide for my child given no other option? How different is this from the\
  \ United States homeless, begging on the street corners for their next meal or alcohol\
  \ consumption?   \nIn true Peruvian tradition, generations of children have been\
  \ thrust into child labor while their government has turned its head. Some Peruvian\
  \ children are forced to work dangerous occupations like mining, sexual exploitation,\
  \ and unsafe farming conditions.  Just to name a few examples of unfair child labor.\
  \   The laws that are in effect today to counter child labor in Peru are often ignored,\
  \ creating uneducated children who will follow in their family\u2019s footsteps.\
  \ Generally known, over one third of the Peruvian adults are below poverty level\
  \ and over one third of Peruvian children are forced to work daily; missing necessary\
  \ schooling and future education to help alleviate them from this sad situation.\
  \  The exact statistics are not known because of vast expanse of Peru\u2019s Amazon\
  \ rain forest where children and people remain under the radar from governmental\
  \ statistics. \nWhat is the answer to turn these unfair working conditions of young\
  \ children around?  If we don\u2019t hand out money on the street corners to Peruvian\
  \ mothers with their children and small llamas how will they provide for their children?\
  \  Will their children spend the night hungry, because their government doesn\u2019\
  t have the provisions necessary to support them?  In the United States there are\
  \ some governmental programs in place to support the non-working, disabled, down\
  \ on their luck or uneducated person. Still in the United States if we didn\u2019\
  t hand that person begging on the street corner whatever change we have in our pocket,\
  \ would they be forced to find some other way to support themselves? Would the same\
  \ thing happen in Peru if tourists stopped giving out Sol or whatever coin was in\
  \ our pocket for that picture? \nVisiting Cusco in Peru, being caught up in the\
  \ moment, I dug deep into my pocket and handed the brightly colored costumed Peruvian\
  \ Mother whatever Sol I had.  Her sad eyes and wrinkled smile thanked me."
