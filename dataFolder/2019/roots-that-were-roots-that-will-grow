Text: "Indecisions usually come on Sunday evenings, in particular during springtime,\
  \ when the sun is going behind the horizon. Drops are falling down the living room\u2019\
  s window, following an ordinary springy storm. The outside light is becoming warmer\
  \ again, while the high fly of the swallows announces the end of the rain. Lying\
  \ on the sofa, I am trapped in the Sunday laziness. On my belly, a book opens exactly\
  \ in half. I am too lazy to immerse myself again in the reading. \n\nFlying from\
  \ London to Bergamo is a time-space travel, from a multicultural city to a hilly\
  \ town in the Northern province of Italy. I left my home country to find fortune,\
  \ but I end up to come back again in search of my lost roots. \n\nFrom the window,\
  \ my gaze passes through the bookcase next to the sofa. \u201CThe Time of the Indifference\u201D\
  \ by Alberto Moravia is followed by \u201CInvisible Cities\u201D by Italo Calvino.\
  \ This is the bookcase with all the books that my family and I have bought during\
  \ the years. Some of the books are still covered by newspapers, an old habit from\
  \ my father for preserving the original covers. Closed to them, there is an African\
  \ woody statue, a present brought by my aunt Giovita when she was volunteering as\
  \ a nurse in Burundi. After that, a blue-green cover attracts my attention. I finally\
  \ get up, raising my arm to fetch an object of a colour that reminds something still\
  \ unresolved in my memory. While I am touching it, my nose immediately recognises\
  \ the smell of the old paper mixed with the plastic of the cover: is this the family\
  \ album where of my childhood?\n \nYes, I remember this bath sink where my grandma\
  \ used to wash me. Look! In the next page, my granddad Arrigo, who loved me so much,\
  \ always in the front to defend me against my evil cousin. We used to play together\
  \ at Parco dei Colli, the National Park of Bergamo full of horrible trolls and sly\
  \ witches.\n\nGranddad Arrigo was one of the first heroes of my life. How much was\
  \ I proud to say from the rooftops that he was a partisan at the age of 22? I grew\
  \ up with his stories on the time he was fighting the fascists throughout the mountains,\
  \ in Northern Italy. He used to narrate how he was sleeping on the trees during\
  \ the night, seeking refuge from the enemy fire. There was also the story about\
  \ the noisy frogs, nearby the pond where they used to camp. He was amazing imitating\
  \ frogs, making absurd sounds to make me laughing hilariously. Who will listen my\
  \ granddad stories during this dark time, where an Italian far-right Minister of\
  \ Justice obstacles rescue ships for migrants in the middle of the Mediterranean?\n\
  \nBy the time I was reaching my teens, granddad Arrigo got sick. It was the sneaky\
  \ illness called Alzheimer, which began by destroying his present thoughts as well\
  \ as preserving his memories on the war. My family reacted as better as they could\
  \ and I followed them. We just accepted the reality, making our best to enjoy our\
  \ time with the granddad, the dad, the husband and the man that Arrigo was. Hence,\
  \ when I heard my granddad telling to a flowerpot to prepare itself for the fungi\
  \ foraging on the next morning, I just asked if I could join them.\n\nEnough for\
  \ today. I finish observing the family album. It is curious how the photographs\
  \ are able to make you travel without leaving your living room. Make a picture.\
  \ Put it in an album. Collect the reality. Build your memory that one day will come\
  \ back again, showing you details that you have already forgotten or replacing what\
  \ you thought on particular settings. It is better to save everything: \u201CThose\
  \ who do not learn History are doomed to repeat it\u201D."
