Text: "As I looked across the bright blue waters, I wondered how something could possess\
  \ such raw beauty. Nestled between the stark Himalayan mountain landscapes of Ladakh\
  \ at an altitude of 14000 feet, lies a vast deep blue stretch of water which is\
  \ known to the locals as Pangong Tso. \n\nI have always been the kind of traveller\
  \ that doesn\u2019t just go to a place, look around and move on to the next one.\
  \ So as I looked at the snow-capped mountains around me, there was a sudden calling\
  \ that was drawing me towards them. I tightened my scarf as a cold breeze blew and\
  \ my decision to climb one of the hills seemed riskier by the minute. But I had\
  \ already made up my mind and nothing could stop me. I went back to the tent, packed\
  \ some water and a first aid kit. Since I was travelling with my friends, I asked\
  \ if any of them wanted to come along. Though I knew only one of them was going\
  \ to accompany me on this journey of mine and that was Shaun. Now what you need\
  \ to know about Shaun is that he has always been part of my impulsive detours for\
  \ as long as I can remember. We've been through it all, from late night impromptu\
  \ camping in the woods to storm chasing on our bicycles.\n\nI checked my watch,\
  \ it was 2 o\u2019clock in the afternoon which gave us more than enough time to\
  \ get to the top and back down before it got dark. Both of us started walking towards\
  \ the base of the hill and as we got closer, we realised that the hill wasn\u2019\
  t as small as we thought it was. At this point both of us looked at each other and\
  \ had the same look in our eyes, there was this spark of excitement that only mad\
  \ men had. It wasn\u2019t easy getting to the base of the hills with a patch of\
  \ jagged rocks in the way. It almost seemed like the hill was warning us to stay\
  \ back and the cold wind stinging our noses didn\u2019t seem to help the situation\
  \ either. The hill was a very steep climb and mostly just sand and shrubbery, which\
  \ made the climbing a herculean task for us. As we went higher, we could feel the\
  \ air getting thin and it was getting harder to breathe. We were almost to the top\
  \ when Shaun started wheezing and told me he couldn\u2019t go any further. At that\
  \ point I had to take the decision of whether to go back down or all the way up.\
  \ He saw this conflict on my face and argued till he finally made sure I go to the\
  \ top.\n\n I started gradually increasing my pace, clawing through the sand to find\
  \ something to grab on to. I could see the top of the hill and that\u2019s what\
  \ kept me going. There was a feeling of immense euphoria as I made the final tug\
  \ to the top. The second I got there, I knew I had made the right decision because\
  \ I had stumbled onto something beyond my wildest dreams. Standing 20 feet away\
  \ from me was one of the most beautiful creatures I\u2019d ever seen, a Tibetan\
  \ wolf. I\u2019d only heard stories from people telling me about times they\u2019\
  d been in the same scenario, but never had I thought how I would react. It was the\
  \ first time I experienced what true fear was. My heart was racing and I could feel\
  \ the pounding in my ears. It was just a brief moment as we both acknowledged each\
  \ other\u2019s presence and went our separate ways. As I climbed down, legs tired\
  \ and hands blistered, I was overcome by a multitude of emotions that was ultimately\
  \ overridden by a sense of calm I\u2019d never felt before."
