Text: "The trip to the Ketermaya refugee camp, sandwiched between mountains in Chouf\
  \ District was not an easy ride. To get to the destination, one is bound\nto get\
  \ lost several times on serpentine, rough mountain roads. Passing by a brick factory\
  \ was the landmark I needed to know that I had finally arrived\nat the isolated\
  \ and disadvantaged camp accommodating around 61 Syrian families. Getting lost had\
  \ given me a better sense of the extent to which the\ncamp goes unnoticed.\nThe\
  \ putrid smells from over ground sewage and the overpopulated makeshift tents brought\
  \ to my mind the Argentinean novelist Ariel Dorfman, who has lived his entire life\
  \ in exile, who once said, \xABI think to be in exile is a curse, and you need to\
  \ turn it into a blessing. You\u2019ve been thrown into exile to die, really, to\
  \ silence you so that your voice cannot come home. And so my whole life has been\
  \ dedicated to saying, 'I will not be silenced\u2019.\xBB\nThe scene inside the\
  \ camp reveals the tragedy of each family there and the scars left by the war in\
  \ Syria in each member: family loss, trauma, and exile, experiences that would leave\
  \ anyone desperate and demoralized. Yet, the children born and raised in Ketermaya\
  \ have been spared these feelings, as they are unfamiliar with the war. The kids\
  \ here can be compared to the scene of the camp from afar, where the physical sense\
  \ of the camp itself diminishes to become a tiny spot surrounded with massive mountains\
  \ of pine and wildflowers growing on their cliffs. Both children grew up in the\
  \ camp and wildflowers symbolize the resilience and love of life.\nAfya Rizq, a\
  \ 38-year-old Syrian collage artist based in As-Suwayda city in Syria, has come\
  \ to the camp to enhance the capacities of the children by connecting them to her\
  \ unwavering conviction of \xABthe door\xBB behind every demolished house and \xAB\
  the light\xBB, even a slim one, penetrating the darkness. These themes are represented\
  \ in dozens of her collage artworks on display in Beirut. Capitalizing on children\
  \ aged between 4 and 8, Afya has been encouraging them \xABnot to be silent\xBB\
  \ and instead express themselves, making use of what may seem ugly or go unnoticed\
  \ inside the camp.\nInside four-meter square classes, silverwalled to reflect the\
  \ sunlight, around 17 kids have been asked to portray their beautiful faces or faces\
  \ they would like to be. After drawing a sketch, they have been tasked with going\
  \ around the camp to collect bottle tops, cardboard, cloth pieces and any other\
  \ type of trash that can be used for recycling. At this point, kids begin to construct\
  \ the items in their portraits after adding their favorite colors to match their\
  \ works.\nThe ultimate goal is to channel any potential existing hate and revenge,\
  \ which are usually incubated in such inhumane circumstances, into an alternative,\
  \ self-created world where the power of imagination can really make a change. \xAB\
  Rather than complaining about the situation, a real change begins when we indeed\
  \ care about our place,\xBB Afya said. \xABIt is essential for children at this\
  \ age to express their feelings, memories and even ongoing plight in the form of\
  \ artwork, this is one of the avenues of much-needed self-expression,\xBB she added.\n\
  Afya, who has come to Beirut to display her collage artwork, has never forgotten\
  \ her love for children. Beginning in 2005, she has used art to heal and motivate\
  \ children inside resettlement camps around her Syrian village. At one of her galleries\
  \ here, she had come across a New York-based humanitarian group who offered her\
  \ to join as a volunteer. Without any hesitation, Afya decided to accompany the\
  \ group. Even after they had left, she stayed, to make a difference with the children\
  \ by turning \xABthe curse\xBB of deprivation and marginalization into a \xABblessing\xBB\
  \ in the sense of planting the seeds of beauty and positivity among them. In other\
  \ words, she was changing their perspective on life and enhancing their capacities\
  \ to \xABtransform the surrounding ugliness into beauty\xBB. \xABEvery child is\
  \ an artist; my role is just to use their perception of the place around them and\
  \ show them the beauty inside what is considered ugly,\xBB Afya said."
