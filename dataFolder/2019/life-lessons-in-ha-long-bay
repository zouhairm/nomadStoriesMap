Text: "Drowning in the cauldron of the sun\u2019s rays, I sat gazing up at the sky,\
  \ an unbroken ribbon of blue stretching out across the horizon. With the boat chugging\
  \ slowly along, plenty of time was afforded to take in the charming sight of rainbow\
  \ coloured fishing villages gently bobbing up and down in the water.\n\nCountless\
  \ generations of fishing communities spanning thousands of years have made these\
  \ waters their home. Tethered with ropes designed to guard against the elements,\
  \ these communities are \u2018close-knit\u2019 in both a literal and symbolic sense.\
  \ Entirely self-sufficient, until recently locals lived permanently offshore, sleeping,\
  \ socialising and even going to school on these floating man-made islets. Accustomed\
  \ to life on the water, it is almost as though the internal body clocks of these\
  \ seafaring folk are in sync with the tides timeless cosmic rhythms.\n\nIn stark\
  \ contrast, I am someone who is ill at ease when close to large bodies of water,\
  \ and I was beginning to feel nauseous. Seeking respite from the searing mid-afternoon\
  \ sun, I retired to the nearest available sun lounger. Finding myself submerging\
  \ into a restful slumber, the sound of our guide An\u2019s voice announcing that\
  \ we are to go swimming out in the cove snapped me back to surface level consciousness.\n\
  \nThat Sinking Feeling\n\nI have never been a confident swimmer, and even with the\
  \ added crux of a life-jacket, the idea of taking the plunge did not sit well with\
  \ me. While the pressure I felt to 'join in' was immense, discomfort experienced\
  \ with being in the water since childhood \u2013 specifically a time where I waded\
  \ too far out to sea \u2013 paralysed me from taking any affirmative action.\n\n\
  However, peering across at the crystalline waters I noticed how bright the sun\u2019\
  s rays were as they reflected off its surface. All of a sudden the water looked\
  \ inviting, seductive almost, and I imagined being soothed by its warmth. As though\
  \ I were having some out-of-body experience, mind and body went their separate ways,\
  \ and within a nanosecond, I had leaped overboard and into the glimmering green\
  \ below.\n\nLimbs flailing in my puffy life-jacket, despite my best efforts I was\
  \ fixed to one spot, as though on some invisible treadmill. Adopting a different\
  \ posture, I turned on my back and started kicking frantically at the water. With\
  \ legs pumping, I caught sight of the cove's sandy shore and righted myself, the\
  \ slimy sea-floor rubbing up against my bare feet and ankles. Dragging my entire\
  \ body weight up out of the water, I realised how much the sodden life-jacket had\
  \ weighed me down. Shorn of my protective skin, I was free to explore, and traipsing\
  \ through the powdery sand, I felt every bit the modern-day, smartphone-wielding\
  \ Robinson-Crusoe. \n\nThis fantasy role-playing scenario was however short-lived.\
  \ Looking out across the bay I saw a tangle of arms waving frantically at me from\
  \ the deck. Cue the second poor decision. Thinking that the life-jacket would only\
  \ slow my progress and with a newfound assurance in my swimming technique, I opted\
  \ to swim back to the boat unaided.\n\nSpeeding to Safety\n\nFor the most part,\
  \ progress was slow but steady. And then I hit a metaphorical brick wall. Despite\
  \ being only thirty or so metres from safety, the swirling current kept knocking\
  \ me off my stride. Exhausted, I could feel my entire body begin to surrender.\n\
  \nThankfully, however, this is where my handsome knight in shining armour, or more\
  \ accurately Bermuda shorts, came to the rescue. Shivering more out of shock than\
  \ from the cold, I earnestly thanked my sandy-haired saviour before being told in\
  \ no uncertain terms that we had to leave immediately for the mainland. Grabbing\
  \ my belongings, I hastily bundled myself into an awaiting speedboat.\n\nAn ironically\
  \ glamorous exit considering I was floundering in the brine just moments before.\
  \ I was oddly becalmed and, reflecting on the day\u2019s activities, I realised\
  \ that the journey had been transformative. With body and soul feeling freshly reinvigorated\
  \ I laid back, basking in the reflected light of the sun\u2019s rays on the bay's\
  \ clear, jade waters."
