Text: "There are few ways to experience awe, and youth is one of them. II was in my\
  \ early twenties and I mostly remember the natural curiosity and awe. I was surrounded\
  \ by warm and loving friends and family but unhappy with my studies, and regularly\
  \ in discussion with a friend about places we wanted to travel. Had I known their\
  \ influences were the beatnick poets like kerouac and hunter s. thompson I may have\
  \ rethought the advice to \"just go to mexico\".\nA friend whom I am still in contact\
  \ with today, went to Egypt with a tiny knapsack, money, and a toothbrush. She was\
  \ also on the list of people encouraging me to take a leap of faith.\n\tMy friend\
  \ Bruno and I booked bus tickets from Montreal to Mexico for 250$. He would be my\
  \ closest friend at that time. We studied spanish on the bus, and when we arrived\
  \ were blessed to encounter people willing to house and feed us. I remember the\
  \ tacos from a local vendor, and questionable meat. We drank horchata, ate fresh\
  \ mangoes, danced with the locals, read the paper, visited museums, and universities,\
  \ traded our time as willing workers of organic farmers, learned local legends and\
  \ myths, got sunburnt in the desert, played catch with a prickly pear, toured some\
  \ of the more dense markets in the world, got sick, tried pulque for the first time,\
  \ stayed at a local horse ranch, and road buses for tiring amounts of time to tour\
  \ the country. \nMexico will always remain as the most beautiful place on the planet\
  \ in my heart. We went to the pyramid of the sun and moon near tehotihuacan,  feeling\
  \ enchanted. There is nothing that can describe the embodiment of a first time encounter\
  \ with ruins that date back to ancient belief systems and ways of life. I was lucky\
  \ to visit pyramids in chiapas (southern mexico near guatemala) as well, but these\
  \ were the first I had ever seen in my life. Quite amazing that people around the\
  \ planet were building structures that followed similar shapes and designs, but\
  \ are a feat for our imagination in modern times. The stories of Indigenous influence\
  \ on this land are so vibrant, and it is fascinating to see living examples of this.\
  \ The pyramids had strange stories I had never heard before, like a baseball game\
  \ played by headhunters, and a strong understanding of astronomy, aztec gods Id\
  \ never heard of, the use of obsidian for carving, and everyday tools. \n\tA quarter\
  \ of the inhabitants in chiapas are indigenous people who are the basis of Mexican\
  \ food, language, ways of relating, clothing, amongst many other things. There is\
  \ the layering of spanish colonial rule, and intermingling of western influence.\
  \ At the time I was there, coca cola was cheaper than water in these communities,\
  \ and water distillation systems were being made from their products. These are\
  \ faint and distant memories that I am raising 12 years later, but the impact was\
  \ so great of scents, and landscape, smiles, wrinkled and young faces, beliefs,\
  \ barriers, deserts, isolated lakes, museums, art galleries, hillsides, food, transit,\
  \ expats, cowboys, rich, and poor. The list goes on and on. its amazing that I can\
  \ recall so vividly a place from being there. Travel made me feel stronger as a\
  \ person. From a distance I could think of home, and the people I love, and who\
  \ love me. I could picture those individuals and imagine my life in contrast to\
  \ the ways I saw people living. Mexico gave me an understanding of other people,\
  \  a taste of new foods,  a new perspective, language, culture,  landscape and challenged\
  \ my ideas of how to exist in the world.\n\nIt cant be underestimated what it feels\
  \ like for an individual having an experience for the first time. That is what excites\
  \ me the most!\n\nThank you for accepting a glimpse of my story! \nI hope to get\
  \ the opportunity to travel more in the future!\nNext stop- portugal?"
