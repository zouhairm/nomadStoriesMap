Text: "Brazil. A significant part of the great obsessions mass of hers. This imaginary\
  \ and distant relationship with the country could have remained so for a while,\
  \ imaginary and distant. After all she did learn Japanese for three years when in\
  \ high school, had developed a taste for Japanese history and remained tuned to\
  \ its culture thanks to the dear friends she acquired along the way. Yet she had\
  \ never set a foot there, nor was it really a project. However, if the idea were\
  \ ever to develop, it would probably have the same basis as for Brazil: take the\
  \ firm decision to rely on fantasies and go build frail certainties elsewhere. Luckily\
  \ enough, she can locate when and where the decision was taken this time. \n\nThe\
  \ day began on a singular tone. Upon waking up, still lying in bed and staring at\
  \ the blue sky she whispered to herself: \"today you have to think like Mother\"\
  . Not like a mother, she does not know them all, but like hers, this magician-heroine-witch-fairy,\
  \ always by her side, one way or another. This is surprising in many ways, but to\
  \ be brief, let us simply note how this morning\u2019s self-injunction contradicts\
  \ the emancipation process that characterizes her. But beggars can\u2019t be chooser:\
  \ that day, she had to feed 15 people including 10 dancers. The difficulty of the\
  \ exercise lies in the fact that the dancers had not eaten enough since their arrival\
  \ from Rio a few days ago. Their lack of appetite for food offered to them is obvious,\
  \ and dancing all day long, they lose weight by the minute. To think like a mother\
  \ is not only to ensure the logistic and culinary gymnastics of the preparation\
  \ of a meal; it is above all a question of choosing the right combinations, those\
  \ which warm the heart as much as they fill the belly.\n\nShe had only known them\
  \ for about ten days, but already her fondness for them had grown to be immense\
  \ and her anguish at the idea that they could suffer from hunger in Switzerland,\
  \ land of opulence, was real. So she thought like Mum: a menu, based on what she\
  \ could perceive of their likes and dislikes, groceries made methodically to finally\
  \ get into the kitchen with the spirit of one who feels invested with a mission.\
  \ They arrived. With her 8 flat mates present to welcome their guests, it was a\
  \ merry and diverse crowed in the flat. They talked a little, gestured a lot, for\
  \ one to be understandable to the other. The worrying number of luxury cars in the\
  \ streets of Geneva was a matter of laughter for all, maybe not for the same reasons.\
  \ Music was put loud and the table was set in dancing. Then the guests sat down,\
  \ formed a circle by the junction of their hands and prayed to thank their god for\
  \ the meal. She watched them, so moved she forgot to eat.\n\nOne does not measure\
  \ enough, here in the West, the mystery which surrounds this act of sharing a meal.\
  \ From the field to the plate, it takes a good combination of fortunate circumstances\
  \ so that cleverly arranged ingredients reach the hungry mouths of gathered friends.\
  \ No wonder that in many religions the repertoire of incantations to the gods is\
  \ related to the earth and its products. Of all the acts of everyday life, that\
  \ of being able to eat and even more so in pleasant company, amply justifies to\
  \ believe. Their prayer and the shared meal were her ticket to Brazil."
