Text: "Last summer was my first time travelling out of Algeria, being a student from\
  \ a middle-class family in a third world country made me believe that travelling\
  \ is not for people like me! I thought to be rich is the first condition to have\
  \ mobility and to see the world as they always told us \u2026 a small village.\n\
  \nIt was for an exchange program with AIESEC, teaching Polish kids in kindergartens\
  \ was a challenge, but was it enough to push myself beyond my limits? Hell no!\n\
  \nI had another big boundary to overcome\u2026  I wanted to travel the maximum number\
  \ of countries with 250 euros! was it the only thing that stepped between me and\
  \ my dream? Definitely not!! \n\nI sat down thinking about how to visit 6 countries\
  \ in 11 days with 250 euros! It was like a fantasy, especially for someone who doesn\u2019\
  t know the external world; the thing I realized is, if I could go abroad after collecting\
  \ money for 3 years, why can\u2019t I do more miracles? I kept using \u201Cwhy not?\u201D\
  \ as my fuel to cross more limits.\n\nThe first place I planned to go to was Berlin\
  \ for many reasons, the first reason was because I was always fascinated by Germany\
  \ and I even speak basic Deutsch, and the second one is that it was the nearest\
  \ destination to my host.\n\nI looked for company to travel with, and there was\
  \ this amazing friend Amine who agreed. We wanted to minimize expenses, so we boiled\
  \ eggs and bought bread and cheese from Poland because it is cheaper\u2026  pikers,\
  \ right?\n\nI put my feet on a German ground for the first time\u2026 the first\
  \ place I wanted to see is the Berlin wall, for me It is a place with a meaning,\
  \ a message that says that we human beings have no limits and nothing can stop us\
  \ from achieving what we want to.\n\nAfter a small tour around the city, we felt\
  \ tired and we thought about finding a place to sleep\u2026 hostels? Really? Of\
  \ course not! It\u2019s summer let\u2019s just sleep on grass; and yeah we were\
  \ frozen after 30 minutes to have the first sleepless night of the trip, the next\
  \ day we thought about staying somewhere\u2026 hostels? Still not an option; we\
  \ bought a cheap tent and we stayed at a million stars hotel in front of the Reichstag.\
  \ \n\nThe next day we planned to go to Prague, but Amine couldn\u2019t keep on for\
  \ financial purposes\u2026 it was hard to accept the fact that I will be alone for\
  \ the rest of the trip, and harder to say goodbye for Amine.\n\nNext on, I went\
  \ to Czech alone \u2026 with my backpack, cheese, bread, a tent and troubles; I\
  \ forgot to download offline maps! It was late at night! No one to ask, neither\
  \ public WIFI \u2026 and again, that was the second sleepless night; in the morning\
  \ I brought a map, and using my phone\u2019s compass\u2026 yeah you guessed it,\
  \ I used the traditional way to surf for the first time in my life.\n\nAfter 3 nights\
  \ without a shower and fueled with just bread and cheese I felt weak and dizzy,\
  \ So I decided to get pampered with an apple as a reward \u2026 And I looked for\
  \ a hostel to stay for the night, should I backdown? you already know the answer.\n\
  \nGoing to the hostel wasn\u2019t that bad \u2026 I realized that hostels mean friends\
  \ when I met Khalil and Serine with whom I had a lot of fun before heading to Bratislava.\n\
  \nBratislava was kind to me, it didn\u2019t cause me any troubles, in fact it gave\
  \ me more friends, so did, Vienna, Budapest and Krakow. \n\nTo be honest 700 words\
  \ is not enough to honor my trip nor the people I shared amazing memories with;\
  \ \n\nTell me again, who said that travelling is just for rich people?!"
