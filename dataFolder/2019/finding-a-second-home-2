Text: "The sound of thousands of marching feet, relentlessly moving and always in\
  \ a hurry, echoed from the old stone walls of Keleti Station in Budapest, where\
  \ my old used-to-be red suitcase and me were standing side by side lost in the grandeur\
  \ of the dome\u2019s ceiling. It was only when the sharp February winds hit my skin,\
  \ still warm from the sleep on the train that I found back to myself standing still\
  \ amongst the moving crowds. It had been years since I had set foot into my hometown.\
  \ \n\nI pushed and pulled my way through the masses at the station, and hailed a\
  \ cab somewhere between an American family and an Asian looking couple. \u2018Hova\
  \ ak\xE1rsz menni\u2019 the gray haired taxi driver mumbled through his enormous\
  \ mustache. I raked my brain forcefully trying to remember any of the Hungarian\
  \ my grandmother used to teach me but fled into the warm comfort of English. Twenty\
  \ minutes, and a little misunderstanding later, I stood in front of a small wooden\
  \ door. The white paint job of the house did not appear to be the most recent and\
  \ unconsciously I started peeling pieces of crumbly dry white off the wood. The\
  \ nervousness dropped off me like baggy trousers when a familiar face opened the\
  \ door. \n\nIt must have been my grandmother, I was sure of it. The same dyed blonde\
  \ strands covering up the fleeting color of her hair, the same wrinkles around her\
  \ eyes from soulful laughter, and the same lines of worry for the loved ones on\
  \ the forehead. I had to fight the urge to reach out and trace the painfully familiar\
  \ lines of long-gone youth on the strangers face. I only knew this lady from images\
  \ I picked up on my grandmothers sixties style nightstand the one with a wonky leg,\
  \ but the resemblance was uncanny. For just a second it felt like I was a kid again\
  \ sitting on her lap, embraced by the hominess of her arms, eating her famous Palacsinta\
  \ (sweet thin pancakes). Then my great-aunt opened her mouth and showered me with\
  \ a rapid stream of Hungarian words. \n\nThe third day and the twentieth Turos Rudi\
  \ later, the words of the strange language slowly started coming back to me too.\
  \ Over a plate of Halaszl\xE9 I remembered the books my grandmother used to read\
  \ to me when I was afraid of the dark and struggled to fall asleep. I remembered\
  \ the animated Kisvakond videocassettes she used to play for me \u2013 but only\
  \ on the weekends that was the rule. With every bite of L\xE1gos and Szegedi K\xE1\
  poszta it all came back to me. A weekend trip turned into a week and then into two.\
  \ And somewhere between the heat of the thermal baths and the winds tugging on my\
  \ hair while climbing the Buda Castle I started to not feel alone anymore."
