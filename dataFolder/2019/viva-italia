Text: "Almost like lightening Carnivale descends over Venice and I, a 5'3, pasty Irish\
  \ girl is thrust mercilessly into the bang of it all. A local 'Betriche' whom I've\
  \ met a local coffee shop offers to take me around the city. Her English is excellent,\
  \ my Italian is sketchy but we manage somehow or another.  The colour is sensational\
  \ and we tip and tumble into a sea of masquerade, decadent costume and full on Opera\
  \ Buskers. Is this a thing? In Venice. Yes it is! \nIt seems like we have been transported\
  \ to a port of the renaissance yet we can stop for a beautiful coffee along the\
  \ way, grab some wifi in order to share the magic with home. \n\nThe bridges are\
  \ narrow and the people are beautiful. On the Ponte della Paglia, which literally\
  \ translates as the \u201CStraw Bridge\u201D I am squashed into elegance. It's hard\
  \ not to notice the fashion and the opulent clothing that the Italians are accustomed\
  \ too. Beatriche informs me that in Italy fashion is an integral part of the culture\
  \ as much so as traditional Irish music in sewn into our fabric in Ireland. I apologise\
  \  for my mismatched fashion -but hey - I am a pasty Irish girl. \n\nThe party atmosphere\
  \ is brilliantly expressed in the paintings of Pietro Longhi and Gabriele Bella\
  \ in two Venetian museums \u2013 the Querini Stampalia  and the Ca\u2019 Rezzonico\
  \ museum. Although rancorously packed we manage to squeeze ourselves in for a goo\
  \ and a gawk at these sensational paintings lit by that extra magic with Carnivale\
  \ booming around us. I look out at the children below parading in bright green,\
  \ red, and blue gittering masks. All the while there is a market seller below selling\
  \ what looks to be the most beautiful silk scarfs. \n\nI buy a mask and a tub of\
  \ generorously portioned Gelato and I sail into the night with Beatriche and now\
  \ a handshome Alexander and we sink into the night.  Didn't even do the Gondola\
  \ but I am totally sailing here. Viva la Venice."
