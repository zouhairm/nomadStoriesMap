Text: "I have never been outside of Mexico before nor I imagined that the place I\
  \ would\xB4ve seen first will be Central America but there I was in Tamarindo, Costa\
  \ Rica, walking on the cleanest beach I\u2019ve ever encounter and said hello to\
  \ an alligator that lives right in front of the bluest ocean I\u2019ve ever seen.\n\
  \nThat being my first international trip and my first ever solo journey, my parents\
  \ were worried to say the least, because that was something I planned in under a\
  \ month, but the spontaneity that came with it was the best thing I\u2019ve could\xB4\
  ve ever done, finding where I was going because of a promotion I found, having the\
  \ place to stay but not the airplane, and not knowing what I was going to do. Skipping\
  \ the making plans and just going with it was the weirdest most amazing experience\
  \ ever.   \n\nBeing a solo traveler I met a lot of people in my activities, some\
  \ were locals but most of them foreigners like me, funny enough I only met two other\
  \ Mexicans, a couple celebrating their honeymoon and the most amazing thing about\
  \ meeting them was that the husband and I share the same roots, we are both from\
  \ Chiapas, an estate in Mexico not many people go to but it is so worth it, showing\
  \ me that I was meant to be there.\n\nI try doing things I\xB4ve never done, so\
  \ I went surfing and I succeed; I try the cuisine, that I have to say it\xB4s really\
  \ similar to the one in Mexico but sweeter; I went and got scuba certified, that\
  \ was by far the greatest thing, everything about the experience was memorable put\
  \ on the suit, the fins, going through the process of checking your gear and experiencing\
  \ the beautiful duality the ocean gives, because under there you can find the calmest\
  \ place but at the same time you can feel the pressure of the water and not knowing\
  \ what you can encounter but that gave me the chance for sharing the habitat many\
  \ wonderful creatures live in, it gave me the opportunity to swim with sharks, sea\
  \ turtles, puffer fish and the one that really touched my heart was swimming with\
  \ blue whales, hearing them on my last dive nearly brought me to tears.\n\nLeaving\
  \ Mexico to see other culture and talking with everyone I encounter made me open\
  \ my eyes and really see things for the first time, it made me change my perspective\
  \ of fear, because fear is a powerful emotion that can control your life. When I\
  \ returned to Mexico City my mother said to me that she was proud of the things\
  \ I\xB4ve done because most people wouldn\u2019t do it \u201Cthey are afraid\u201D\
  , she said, and when I asked her why she just said to me \u201Cbecause for some\
  \ people it\xB4s scary trying new things.\u201D And that really hit me.\n\nWe have\
  \ a saying in Mexico that reeds \u201Cm\xE1s vale pedir perd\xF3n que pedir permiso\u201D\
  \ (better ask for forgiveness than permission) and that is how I like to do things,\
  \ willing to try things, just as long they are experiences that can teach me.\n\n\
  There\u2019s nothing scarier than being trapped in your comfort zone, that\xB4s\
  \ why they say traveling changes your life because it changes your perspective,\
  \ and changing your perspective means viewing things a little bit different and\
  \ you get to change the way you see the world, knowing that it's not a scary place."
