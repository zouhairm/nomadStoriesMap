Text: "A 16-hour train ride from Guiyang to Xi'an with a crying baby in the contiguous\
  \ bed may not sound very appealing to most people, and of course it didn't seemed\
  \ the ideal way of travelling for me either. However, this trip turned out being\
  \ a much more enjoyable moment than I thought.\n\n  That baby was the son of a young\
  \ woman, a woman from some distant rural area. He wouldn't stop crying and she was\
  \ desperate to calm him down. \n\n  I didn't know what to do to help her and I also\
  \ didn't want to intrude and make her even more nervous, so I just smiled to her\
  \ and wave at him, trying to bring some comfort to them both.\n \n One friendly\
  \ man from Xinjiang region had just come to our carriage to struck conversation\
  \ with probably the only foreigner in the train, me. Being the one and only foreigner\
  \ is not something uncommon when taking the slow train far from the main cities\
  \ in China.\n\n  Hearing that the baby started crying again, this man suddenly offered\
  \ the woman to hold her child in his arms. A complete stranger helping this young\
  \ mother in need, in such a way it seem to come natural to him.\n \n The baby stopped\
  \ crying when placed in this man's arms and the mother's face changed and showed\
  \ relief.\n  \n Contemplating his stranger's offering and his caring attitute towards\
  \ that beautiful boy made my love for Chinese people and culture grow bigger than\
  \ it was already. The sense of community in that carriage made my heart warm.\n\n\
  This scene made me think that a very small but kind gesture can make a bigger impact\
  \ that you ever imagine. \n\nBe kind, always."
