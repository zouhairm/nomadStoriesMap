Text: "We hesitantly exit the comfort of our air-conditioned private van, apprehensive\
  \ about the scene ahead of us.  Men on scooters wiz by with speeds that seem unsafe\
  \ for such small roads and large crowds, but of course they\u2019ve been doing this\
  \ their whole lives and are well practiced at the art of avoiding wrecks.  Within\
  \ moments of being outside, the heckling starts: what do you need lady, I give you\
  \ good price.  Best price in the market.  It\u2019s free to look!  \n\nI\u2019m\
  \ trying to portray a sense of confidence to mask the fear inside me, a fear that\
  \ I don\u2019t want to admit to the hecklers, my travel partner, or myself.  Already\
  \ our long skirts which felt breezy and effortless by the beach are trapping the\
  \ dry dusty heat of Stone Town close to our bodies, and the shawls draped over our\
  \ shoulders to appear modest in this Muslim culture certainly aren\u2019t acting\
  \ as cooling agents.  My mouth is dry as the dirt floors, and the sips from the\
  \ water bottle that instantly turned warm no longer quenches the nagging thirst\
  \ that continues to creep up on me.  \n\nWe enter the spice market, at first wondering\
  \ the reason behind the red-hued tint that engulfs the space, before realizing that\
  \ red tarps hang from the top of the market stalls to keep the outdoor space covered.\
  \  Wooden stalls are crammed together along a dirt path each selling seemingly identical\
  \ spices at the best price, madame, cheap for you.  The market is a mix of locals\
  \ and a few tourists, with the occasional chicken or cat also crossing into the\
  \ mix.  The heckling is constant, which makes me wonder if anyone has ever told\
  \ these shop keepers that yelling at customers makes most of them very uncomfortable.\
  \  \n\nVibrant spices of all sorts are laid out in a checkered pattern in front\
  \ of us: chili powder, cinnamon, turmeric, vanilla, coffee, ginger, curry mixes\
  \ \u2013 the list is endless.  Those not selling spices are selling fresh produce,\
  \ most of it foreign to me.  When I imagined this spice market, I expected fragrant\
  \ and juxtaposing smells to attack my nostrils; this market was the exact opposite.\
  \  While a faint smell of gasoline and generic animal waste lingered in the air,\
  \ all of the spices were packaged so tightly that their aromas were unable to escape.\
  \  \n\nWithin a few minutes we found a seemingly unattended stall, and for a moment\
  \ were able to browse the spices in peace.  When its patron returned, his demeanor\
  \ was much more mellow than that of his neighbors, so we stayed to peruse, and ultimately\
  \ buy, from him.  Slowly, our hesitance was fading \u2013 we will be ok today."
