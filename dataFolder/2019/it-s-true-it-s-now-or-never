Text: I'm not the kind of person that loves travelling but it all began when my cousin
  asked me along to London in 2017, that's where I believe that travelling is something
  I would want to do if I have the opportunity to travel around and write stories.
  Stories not only about myself but prior more to planning, journey, preparation,
  during and after. There are more than 100 countries on this Earth. Each country
  has their own culture and story behind it. It's amazing to go to other country and
  learn about their daily life routine, about their education, work style, transportation,
  best places to shop, best places to relax, best places to enjoy. I didn't expect
  to find happiness in travelling. I used to hate travelling so much that I drag myself
  to pack for vacation on the day itself that I was supposed to fly off! But, packing
  it at the very last minute it's not always a bad idea though. If you forgot to bring
  your makeup, you can go to their make up store and find what's there. Surprise yourself!
  You could find something new that you wouldn't or didn't get to see in your local
  shop. I love going to those parks where you can just walk around with the windy
  weather.. It's therapeutic for me but at the same time I enjoy it so much because
  I want to have my own time within myself. I enjoy going around the city on my own..
  It's beautiful. I believe Earth is created for us to recognise how beautiful each
  country are and the people.
