Text: "Nobody makes a trip abroad expecting to get deported. Turns out it might be\
  \ a blessing, if there's a stop between destinations involved. I wasn't allowed\
  \ in at my intended original place of arrival because I didn\u2019t have a tourist\
  \ visa, which I didn\u2019t know I needed. I was put in a flight back to Bogota\
  \ -even with the same on-air crew who puzzled asked me if I wanted to have lunch\
  \ again. \n\"Let us deal with this\", the Colombian migration officer told my 'guardians'\
  \ as we landed in Bogota, and all my stress turned into a big smile when he said\
  \ \"everyone is welcome here, if you decide to spend your weekend in this city instead.\
  \ I said yes, and it was a yes to some of the happiest years of my life. \nI took\
  \ a cab at the airport and the driver was a blessing as well.  Quickly told him\
  \ what had happened and he proceeded to tell me about the city, recommend places\
  \ I could go to, and made me laugh during the whole ride. I saved his number after\
  \ I paid for the room at the hotel he chose for me downtown, (he waited to make\
  \ sure there was accommodation available), and he was my driver for  that weekend.\
  \  He was my driver again when I returned two months later with my parents. And\
  \ when a month after that I moved there, he was my driver for the following two\
  \ years. And friend. \nIt was already late but I wasn't willing to wait till the\
  \ next day to try that delicious coffee everyone talks about. They weren't wrong,\
  \  and I slept really well, by the way. It was the beginning of the best unplanned\
  \ short trip of my life. Never have I drunk tastier berry juices than there. And\
  \ the staff's personality was just as juicy and heartwarming. \nMy new friend took\
  \ me to a place where he normally stopped by to have lunch. Those lovely places\
  \ you only know through a local. Then he took me to the Monserrate hill; I don't\
  \ know if I had pain in my tummy due to hiking with no condition whatsoever or because\
  \ of all his jokes. Now I realize it was not just him a blessing, but everyone I\
  \ met during those two years. Colombian people are the perfect mix between showing\
  \ you the best they've got and taking interest in the best your country's got. They\
  \ make you feel special. They make you feel as if they had personally invited you\
  \ to spend time in their land. When they say you're welcome there, they mean every\
  \ word of it. \nThe following day I took a tour that can't be nothing but sensational.\
  \ The salt Cathedral, so beautiful and interesting I didn't realize how much I had\
  \ walked. A good friend of mine told me months later it did taste like salt (I talked\
  \ about that trip so still excited that besides my parents, other people had to\
  \ travel there, too). Then lunch time at Andres Carne de Res. I can guarantee a\
  \ more exotic, flamboyant set up you will never see. Not a single decoration-free\
  \ spot can be seen on the walls and yet, not disturbing at all. Impressive salad\
  \ bar. Obviously I took my parents there when I went back. A man in a mailman costume\
  \ handed a paper sheet to my dad, who wrote something; the mailman returned to our\
  \ table later, with the sheet in an envelope and a chocolate: love mail for my mom.\
  \ We also had a magician, singers, mini stand up routines\u2026all these great performers\
  \ who walk around entertaining diners at their tables. \nBefore that trip, I didn't\
  \ know Colombia was a big emerald producer. I don't think I will ever get my mom\
  \ a souvenir she likes more than that pair of earrings. And I will never be more\
  \ grateful for accidentally visiting a country that was not in the bucket list.\
  \ I met my first love, I found my best friend. She has visited my country, too.\
  \ And I'll go back to hers one more time because, well, I'm a bridesmaid."
