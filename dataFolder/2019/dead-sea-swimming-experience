Text: "It was an adventure to float in the Dead Sea.  One of those sensations I'd\
  \ like to only have a few times in my life. The ground from the changing rooms to\
  \ the sea was a rock surface leading down a mountain. Nothing like the soft sand\
  \ on a level surface by the Mediterranean Sea where I stood on the northwest side\
  \ of Israel.  The Dead Sea was east of Jerusalem.  It's the lowest point on earth\
  \ at 1,300 feet below sea level.  Having 21 healing minerals it was a free spa!\n\
  \tThe sky was grey and the sea was brown like the Atlantic Ocean at the Jersey Shore.\
  \  I've seen beautiful pictures of the Dead Sea where it was aqua.  I guess it has\
  \ to do with how the sky reflects onto the water.  \n\tStepping into the sea my\
  \ water shoes got muddy.  Moving slowly I was ankle deep in the mud.  I found a\
  \ rock surface and stepped up onto it.  When I was waist deep in the salt water\
  \ I sat down.  I couldn't touch the bottom!  I let my legs float in front of me.\
  \  I reached down to touch the mud rubbing it onto my legs.  The mud felt slimy\
  \ on me. I rubbed it on my arms, chest, neck, face and a little bit on my back.\
  \ Using the salt water I washed it off.  The salt water on my face and lips stung.\
  \  Licking my lips stung my mouth.  \n\tWith my arms, I moved myself deeper into\
  \ the water. I didn't have to tread water even though it was over my head.   I was\
  \ floating vertically.  My shoulders were out of the water.  Having no gravity this\
  \ was the training ground for astronauts!  At one point I was floating on my back\
  \ and flipped over to floating on my stomach without intending to.  I doggy paddled\
  \ for a little while.  \n\tWhen it came to getting out I doggy paddled to water\
  \ where I could stand.  I walked a little bit in the mud and ended up sinking until\
  \ the mud was up to my shins.  I asked for help from someone in my group.  They\
  \ helped me get to the rocky surface.  I tripped hitting my knee, but I made it\
  \ out of the water okay.  Walking back to the bus my skin glowed.  This was definitely\
  \ not my average day at the beach."
