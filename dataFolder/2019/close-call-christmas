Text: "Tenerife, 2015\n....\n\nWhen we woke the next morning we were already anticipating\
  \ our free christmas whale watching tour.\nIt was December 24th 2015 and we arrived\
  \ at the pier 11am sharp.\nWe stepped onto the \u2018Octopuseye Sailing Yacht\u2019\
  \ and introduced ourselves to Captain Carlos who immediately offered us something\
  \ to drink and told us there\u2019d be sandwiches later, too.\nAfter waiting for\
  \ some time Carlos received a call and was told that his clients cancelled.\nNow\
  \ it looked like there was no reason to set sails\u2026\n\xBBAh you know what? I\
  \ like you guys - Let\u2019s cruise!\xAB\nAnd with that he took the wheel and we\
  \ left port.\nWe chatted, got to know Carlos a bit more and had fun together.\n\
  He claimed to be a youtuber as well as in a band. When Sabrina heard \u2018guitar\u2019\
  \ she immediately lit up and wanted to play this instrument that she\u2019d been\
  \ playing for years and has been missing on this island, only playing my cheap plastic\
  \ ukulele here and then. \nCarlos took out his guitar from inside the ship and Sabrina\
  \ unleashed her beautiful voice to sing the passing whales a song at sea.\nIt was\
  \ a magical christmas thanks to this random encounter with this awesome guy and\
  \ his ship.\nWhen we were a bit further out he offered us to use his equipment;\
  \ glasses and fins, to take a dip in the ocean. I\u2019ve never really found joy\
  \ in getting wet, so I passed.\nSabrina on the other hand lived most of her life\
  \ in the water and has been telling me a few times that she misses having fins,\
  \ so she didn\u2019t let this opportunity slip.\nShe changed into her bikini, took\
  \ the glasses and fins and jumped in.\n\nShe happily splashes about in the water\
  \ and Carlos and I smile at seeing her having fun.\nShe looks at the ship from underneath\
  \ the surface for a few seconds, and Carlos and I start to chat and forget about\
  \ her for a moment. \nWhen I look in her direction again I see her just diving under,\
  \ swimming away from the boat.\nEven tho the wind is blowing harshly Carlos and\
  \ I suddenly hear roaring engine sounds to our left and both immediately stand up\
  \ to see where it\u2019s coming from and inhale sharply when we see the quickly\
  \ approaching source of the sound:\nA black air cushion boat is darting towards\
  \ Sabrina\u2019s path at relentless speed from maybe 50 meters away, and she is\
  \ still under water without a single clue of what is coming for her and would reach\
  \ her in less than five seconds \nCarlos and I immediately start jumping up and\
  \ down waving shouting yelling for the guys on the boat to notice us over its thundering\
  \ engine and for a seemingly never ending moment it seems completely hopeless -\
  \ our words just thin air that is easily carried out to sea and lost forever. Desperation\
  \ hits me like a plank across the face and sends a jolt through my spine as the\
  \ black danger is ferociously closing in.\nAnd just three short seconds before the\
  \ inevitable impact Carlos thunders the loudest HEEEEEEEYYY!!!! I have ever heard\
  \ coming out of a person\u2019s throat, and signals the now alert driver to stop\
  \ his boat. Which he immediately does as he slams on the brakes.\nAnd to this day\
  \ today I am still incredibly amazed by how quickly this vessel managed to slow\
  \ down, from unforgiving speed to a complete halt within not even two meters; It\
  \ seemed impossible. And just as it stops, a head pops out of the water mere inches\
  \ away from the exact center in front of the boat where the ship\u2019s engine\u2019\
  s propeller would\u2019ve relentlessly plowed through and cleaved her head to tiny\
  \ pieces. \nSabrina looks obviously shocked and aghast, but she\u2019s alive and\
  \ well. \nCarlos had just saved her life.\n\nCaptain Carlos the most random christmas\
  \ encounter.\nTo this day today and forever I am endlessly grateful for his quick\
  \ reaction.\nAnd for randomly inviting two strangers onto his ship anyways."
