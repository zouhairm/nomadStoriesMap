Text: "I have always loved to travel \u2013 there is nothing more enriching than getting\
  \ to experience other cultures, learn about the history of other countries and meet\
  \ new people. Now Bali is that but on overload \u2013 in Bali, not only are you\
  \ getting the exposure to the Balinese culture, but the island is jam-packed with\
  \ people from all over the world. I have never gotten to meet and speak to so many\
  \ people of different nationalities on any of my previous travels, and it was incredible!!\n\
  \nBefore I decided to go forward with this trip, being the ever so optimistic person\
  \ that I am, I was worried as \"normal\" people do about the possibilities of dying\
  \ from an earthquake or tsunami or some other natural disaster out of my control.\
  \ I know that this isn\u2019t normal but it happens to be my norm when dealing with\
  \ my anxiety. I almost didn\u2019t go ahead with booking and after I had, all of\
  \ the earthquakes hit Lombok. Needless to say, I decided to go forth anyway because\
  \ it was one of those moments where I had to tell myself that life is meant to be\
  \ lived, and that I can\u2019t spend my time worrying about things that may not\
  \ even happen and more importantly, are 125% out of my control. And I am beyond\
  \ glad that I did because this is one of those experiences that I will NEVER forget!!\n\
  \nFrom the streets of Kuta filled with markets and partying, to Uluwatu to experience\
  \ an epic sunset at the temple surrounded by monkeys, to the rustic island of Lembongan\
  \ where I have never seen water so blue, and was brought to silence by the sunset\
  \ at Devil\u2019s Tears \u2013 this trip was magnificent. But besides all of the\
  \ activities, my very favourite part was chatting to people whether they were locals\
  \ and hearing them sing the \u201CWaka Waka\u201D every time that we said we were\
  \ from South Africa, or chatting to other tourists and hearing the, \u201Cbut you\u2019\
  re white??\u201D with that very puzzled look when telling them that we are South\
  \ African. I didn\u2019t realise how much joy could come from not only hearing about\
  \ other people\u2019s countries, but getting to tell people about the rich and culturally-diverse\
  \ country which is South Africa.\n\nWhat I realise with every single trip that I\u2019\
  ve had is that I come back a more enriched and fulfilled person, and there is no\
  \ monetary value that can be placed on that. The experience of travelling alone\
  \ allows you to learn so much more about yourself, you\u2019re forced out of your\
  \ comfort zone and you find yourself smack-bang in the centre of the unknown. I\u2019\
  ve had so many trips where I didn\u2019t enjoy it to the extent that I should\u2019\
  ve, having an anxiety disorder and being away from home can be so tough and although\
  \ I was there, I wasn\u2019t always fully present in the moment. But this time I\
  \ chose to embrace the experience and to just enjoy it and relish in it. I did things\
  \ that I never thought that I would do, from singing a Taylor Swift song with a\
  \ band in front of an entire restaurant, to parasailing with my fear of heights\
  \ (and death).\n\nThere was just something about Bali that made me embrace the moment\
  \ more than I have ever done in my entire life. It made me forget my worries, it\
  \ made me think of the things that I was holding onto so differently, it made me\
  \ realise that although we are in our own little worlds with all of our problems,\
  \ that there is a whole wide world out there filled with people and that life is\
  \ actually not that hard, and that my problems are actually not that big. It made\
  \ me realise that I need to find the joy in every situation and that I need to start\
  \ living my life instead of being a spectator to life happening around me.\nIn fact\
  \ when I look back on it, I would go as far as to say that Bali gave me a bit of\
  \ a spiritual awakening. So thank you Bali for that, it\u2019s exactly what I needed!"
