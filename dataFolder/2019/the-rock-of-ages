Text: "The first time I saw a shrine, I was both intrigued and apprehensive. It was\
  \ my first visit to Ogun State, and I knew I had to visit the infamous Olumo rock.\
  \ A little intro for those just hearing of the place: Olumo Rock is one of the top\
  \ tourist destinations in Ogun State, Nigeria. Situated in the town of Abeokuta,\
  \ the state\u2019s capital, Olumo rock served as a fortress for the people of Egbaland\
  \ in the 19th century during the inter-tribal war. The town gets its name from its\
  \ peculiar attribute\u2026rocks, and translates 'Under the Rock.' \n\nI was excited\
  \ and couldn\u2019t wait to experience this place I had heard and read so much about.\
  \ The gate fee is quite affordable; about 2 dollars for an adult, and even less\
  \ for a kid. So I walk in, and there\u2019re young men looming about offering to\
  \ be my tour guide (I would later on discover only descendants of the Egba people\
  \ are allowed to take on the job).\n\nI pick one of them (which was quite difficult,\
  \ they all seemed eager and welcoming) and we began our journey through history\
  \ (this sounded so much better in my head). \n\nPlaced at the center, the water\
  \ fountain was the first indigenous art to pique my interest. It was made of rocks,\
  \ and a cowrie-laced calabash balanced atop the piles- even the calabash was made\
  \ of rock! The calabash served as the water-source, pouring crystal clear water\
  \ all over the rock body which then collected into the pool. \n\nThen we had to\
  \ ascend this long (strangely easy-to-climb) trail of stairs, I almost dropped when\
  \ he told me they were handmade, all carved from rocks.\n\nWow.\n\nThe shrine was\
  \ the first stop before we ventured into the tunnels. You can almost miss it, with\
  \ it located a bit into the rocks. But I didn\u2019t. I see the dried blood and\
  \ dead birds hanging on this little brown door three steps away from where we stood,\
  \ and I gaze at it, he follows my eyes and explains it\u2019s the Orisa Olumo Chamber,\
  \ a.k.a the shrine.\n\nPrior, I have always associated shrines with human sacrifices,\
  \ and you would too if you\u2019ve heard the sorts of stories I grew up listening\
  \ to. Anyways, my curiosity gets the better of me and I ask, if human sacrifices\
  \ were carried out in the shrine.\n\n\u201COh, yes,\u201D He replies. And I stare\
  \ open-mouthed at him. \u201CIt was done to protect the children of the Egbaland\
  \ from harm.\u201D He finished.\n\nAs though reading my mind, he quickly adds, \u201C\
  But we no longer do them.\u201D \n\nI gesture to the birds handing on the door.\n\
  \n\u201CJust animals.\u201D He answers, \u201CWe sacrifice the animals to keep our\
  \ people and visitors safe.\u201D\n\nHe said it was done so no one would fall off\
  \ the mountain. \n\n\u201CDoes this mean no one has fallen off before?\u201D A scary\
  \ thought, given the mountain is a whopping 137metres above sea level.\n\nHe swore\
  \ no one has. \n\nThe art gallery was by far my favorite, and then the mini-museum.\
  \ On my way down, I opted for the elevator (an upgrade from its renovation in 2006)\
  \ but unfortunately it wasn\u2019t in service, so I took stairs\u2026again (P.S\
  \ An ideal location if you\u2019re looking to burn some extra calories during your\
  \ vacation lol).\n\nThe view when you get to the top of the mountain is breathtaking,\
  \ and even though I am not a sucker for heights, I am super glad I took that trip."
