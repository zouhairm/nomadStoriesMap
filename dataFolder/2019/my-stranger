Text: "I was, as usual, late and my train was, as usual, later. \n\nGasping for breath\
  \ as I approached the expected coach position, I was glad there was a platform seat\
  \ empty, except for one person in a turquoise salwar. A glittery maroon dupatta\
  \ fell elaborately over her broad shoulders; orange flowers filled her waist-long\
  \ braid. Many passengers stood waiting nearby, despite the ample space next to her.\
  \ Even as I sat, pushing the handle of my trolley down, she turned to me and smiled.\
  \ And I understood why no one chose to sit with \u2018her\u2019, the transgender.\
  \ I truly hope I had returned the smile. I cannot forget how miserable and stupid\
  \ I felt to have landed in that situation.\n \nLet me call her \u2018she\u2019,\
  \ because of the clothes. In a voice that did not match her choice of appearance,\
  \ she asked me in Telugu where I was travelling to. I lied that I did not know Telugu.\
  \ She repeated in English. I sheepishly said, \u2018Coimbatore\u2019. The train\
  \ was going to Coimbatore, and I felt prudish about telling a \u2018stranger\u2019\
  \ that I was travelling to Kerala.  \n\n\u2018Where in Coimbatore?\u2019 she asked.\n\
  \ \n\u2018Sai Baba Colony,\u2019 I replied (the only place I knew of in Coimbatore).\n\
  \n\u2018I am travelling to Coimbatore, too\u2019, she said. \n\nI smiled politely,\
  \ to end the conversation, acutely aware of stares from all around. I had a ticket\
  \ in an AC coach, so once the train arrived, this unpleasant scene would be over.\
  \ A transgender would surely not travel in upper class compartment!\n\nWhen the\
  \ train arrived, \u2018she\u2019 boarded my coach first. Effortlessly lifted up\
  \ my trolley with her gnarled, strong hands, her dozen glass bangles jingling. Flustered,\
  \ I thanked her, barely making eye contact. In seconds, I realised we would spend\
  \ the coming few hours in close proximity: we had aisle side seats opposite one\
  \ another. \n\nSometime later, I called home. My mother asked about my connecting\
  \ train from Coimbatore to my home town. \u2019I\u2019ll let you know,\u2019 I muttered\
  \ in Malayalam. Amma was not satisfied with that vague phrase. I listed the connecting\
  \ trains I could take: Kerala Express, Raptisagar, Sabari. I told her I was sceptical\
  \ about catching Kerala: my current train was running an hour late. It would take\
  \ me a while to get off, go to the counter, buy another ticket\u2026. \n\nAnyone\
  \ who heard me could have understood how my mother was cajoling me to take the Kerala\
  \ Express and reach home earlier. It was only a three-day visit.\n\nA few minutes\
  \ after the call, \u2018she\u2019 asked me, \u2018So you are travelling to Kerala,\
  \ not Sai Baba Colony in Coimbatore?\u2019 I felt wretched. With a shrug, I said\
  \ I had not wanted to share my travel plans with a stranger. \u2018She\u2019 nodded,\
  \ smiled.\n\nNo one spoke in the coup\xE9. There was just this loud, uncomfortable\
  \ silence.\n\nI wish I carried a book.\n\nAt night, I got another call from home.\
  \ A repeat of the earlier conversation. As I disconnected, still unsure of my onward\
  \ travel plans, \u2018she\u2019 told me that our train had picked up pace, and that\
  \ Kerala Express was running late. \u2018She\u2019 had a huge smart phone. \u2018\
  She\u2019 suggested that I book an online ticket for Kerala Express right then.\
  \ I said, \u2018Sure\u2019. My phone was a basic Nokia 130. I could not access Net.\n\
  \nI climbed to the top berth; \u2018she\u2019 to hers; and I fell sleep.\n \nPast\
  \ 11 pm, I woke up to someone gently tapping my berth. It was \u2018her\u2019. \u2018\
  She\u2019 told me how Kerala Express was still running late and would reach Coimbatore\
  \ only 20 minutes after our train would. \u2018You could still catch the first connecting\
  \ train,\u2019 \u2018she\u2019 explained. \u2018Give me your details so I can book\
  \ your ticket online.\u2019\n\nAfter a silence, I acquiesced. In minutes, I got\
  \ the SMS confirmation. I paid \u2018her\u2019 for the ticket, thanked \u2018her\u2019\
  . \u2018She\u2019 thanked me back.\n\nAs we got off the next morning at Coimbatore,\
  \ Kerala Express was arriving on another platform. \u2018She\u2019 ran with me,\
  \ lugging my bag.\n\nBefore I boarded, I apologised to \u2018her\u2019 for my indifference\
  \ the previous evening. \u2018She\u2019 smiled: \u2018Now I know you will never\
  \ do that to any of us, ever.\u2019"
