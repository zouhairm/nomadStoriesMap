Text: "The tides were not high that day. We were able to walk to the island that is\
  \ usually hovering above the water like a castle from a fantasy fiction. The magic\
  \ of it, though, is not only about the ever-changing tidal range. Mont-Saint-Michel\
  \ is a fairy-tale itself, and the only thing missing is an actual fairy that will\
  \ guide you through the sinuous pathways leading to the abbey on top of the magnificent\
  \ island. \n\nFairies don\u2019t usually indulge in omelettes. You surely will,\
  \ though, if you ever happen to visit this wonderful sight. Mont-Saint-Michel is\
  \ celebrated not only as a great historic place for Christian pilgrimage, but also\
  \ for the World Omelette Society members, because the dish served here is considered\
  \ among the best on Earth.\n\nWell, the heavenly omelette would not have come as\
  \ a surprise, had we learned before that the island is believed to be blessed by\
  \ the Archangel Michael himself, who inspired a bishop living in the 8th century\
  \ to build a church atop it.\n\nDon\u2019t know about the religious, but the abbey\
  \ is surely a must-see attraction for the believers of magic. Trust me, it\u2019\
  s the Hogwarts incarnated. The stony pathways and candles will resonate with any\
  \ wizarding world fan, and the ceiling decorated with hundreds of feathers will\
  \ wingardium-leviosa your mind. \n\nAround 50 inhabitants of the island live in\
  \ small double-storey houses. The villagers also offer homemade crepes which must\
  \ be shared with the birds flying in and out through the open windows, because,\
  \ you know, that\u2019s the price you pay! \L\n\nOne thing, on the other hand, is\
  \ priceless. The marvelous view of the bay can be enjoyed at Terrasse de l\u2019\
  Ouest, which offers a stunning panorama over the Normandy waters. \n\nRemember to\
  \ watch out for the tides on your way back. We didn't. So another Harry Potter spell\
  \ was needed to get us back to our car."
