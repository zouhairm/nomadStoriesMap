Text: "To emigrate,  the first months, is like deciding to have a nomadic life. You\
  \ go directly to the unknown, beyond what Google told you.\n\nDespite being in the\
  \ same continent, you find yourself with a new language, a new culture, and a new\
  \ way of seeing life, through which you open your mind, and then begins the magic:\
  \ Arise endless possibilities for you. It\xB4s like a dawn.\n\nFrom the sunny beaches\
  \ of the Caribbean, to the snow-capped mountains of the Cordillera, there is an\
  \ immense difference. Each day the weather can be different, start at 5 degrees\
  \ and end at 30. However, the beauty of the city of Santiago, its buildings and\
  \ its sunsets, makes the weather a mere detail to get used to.\n\n1 hour driving\
  \ to any cardinal point and change the landscape, you get closer to the mountain\
  \ even more, or you immerse yourself in the magic of the sea. You listen \"galla\"\
  \ or \"cabra\" and you can understand anything, even if you speak spanish, because\
  \ in Chile these words have their own meaning, and here everything is called as\
  \ an animal. \n\nSo, even when you pack your whole life, in the only suitcase that\
  \ the airline allows you, the emotion for the new life is impressive. I'm still\
  \ in discovery mode, especially myself; and conscious expansion, is the phrase that\
  \ describes better my discoveries of the last 4 years. Diversity and a recent mix\
  \ of races, make Santiago an ideal city to live for a while. Maybe, it's time to\
  \ take my suitcase, with my life inside, somewhere else\n\nFrom Venezuela to Chile,\
  \ and now from Chile to the world."
