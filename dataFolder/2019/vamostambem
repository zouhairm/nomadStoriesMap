Text: When I was 23 yeas old I loose everything. From one day to the other I loose
  my job and because of that I had no money to buy food for me and my dog, pay my
  rent, wather and eletricity. After long time feeling starve I decided move city
  looking for a new oportunity. In this new city I could start from zero and luckly
  I got a new job and make a big american friend who teached me my basic english.
  After 3 years saving money, I could visit this friend in US. But what I didn't expect
  find during this trip was my real soul. How strong I am and what I learned by my
  force of will. When I was comming back home I cryed a lot inside the air plane.
  Not because I was comming back home. But because I was creating a breakpoint in
  my life. And I could see that my new personality was more strong and limitless.
  And that was just the begginig... Now Im a travel addicted and more I learn more
  I want to learn but is not only about that. I want to make people see how strong
  they are and what they can do when they want to do. Every where I pass I tell the
  people my history, I make new friends and with this I plant on they heart a seed
  of love, will and streght to keep looking far and fight they fears to grow and reach
  they goal doen't matter the cost. Because happiness is the most precious thing in
  like that we can have and when I was thinking in suicide alone inside a dark house
  with my dog, I could see how split we can be and this is something I don't wish
  to anyone. And now, after 3 continents and many countries, I think I'm a example
  of happiness to show to the people is they want the world, it theirs.
