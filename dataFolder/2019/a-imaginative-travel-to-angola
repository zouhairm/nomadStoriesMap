Text: "This summer I decided to find a place to feed my inspiration and help me to\
  \ write my new novel. I'm a writer, I have been Living in Dublin for two years,\
  \ a central city into Europe, Angola in Africa called my attention because of its\
  \ surround of nature.\nI booked a hotel boutique the Art Thomas Gallery, a perfectly\
  \ choose when you can the nice beach pictures on the site, and theres an exposition\
  \ of art from local artists . I discovered that the government of Angola just opened\
  \ the visa for foreign I also was excited to buy some pictures of African Artist\
  \ and put on my flat in Europe. \nI arrived in Angola on Sunday night, then I try\
  \ to change my money for local money, the only problem was I wasn\u2019t aware of\
  \ the tax Cambio and my dollars suddenly become a small packet of two Thousand Kenzas.\
  \ \nI thought it would be enough money for one weekend but when I took the taxi,\
  \ I started feeling poor as I never was before, my heart beet deeply when I saw\
  \ the taximeter charging for hundred kenzas per minutes.How would I know the money\
  \ in the country would cost so expensive and I would not be allowed to use my credit\
  \ card ? I banned the idea of buying my African piece of art and I asked desperately\
  \ for driver pull over because I wouldn\u2019t have enough money to pay.The taxi\
  \ driver suddenly opens the door and I left. \nI was walking on the road with my\
  \ colorful bags when I saw some boys approaching and trying to get my bag, they\
  \ weren't aggressive, but it was evident I called attention looking like one of\
  \ few tourists that they have meet into the island.\nI started to run and finally\
  \ I arrived on the hotel . I weren\u2019t familiar with the reality of security\
  \ in Africa, I didn\u2019t expect the security guard to carry a big, as I could\
  \ speak Portuguese I ask if something was wrong , what he just said it was a normal\
  \ safe procedure in Luanda.\n In the reception I was attended to a very slim black\
  \ woman, she said I was not allowed to go out by evening unaccompanied, so I preferred\
  \ to avoid the bodyguard and guns and I stayed at room watching for a documentary\
  \ of N\u2019Angola music. I fall asleep with the sweet rhythm, I dream that was\
  \ in Bahia Brazil, it was an African party and for some connection that I can't\
  \ explain, my body was dancing N\u2019agola and smelling of vanilla and coconut.\n\
  I Woke up six o clock in the morning with the sound of waves slaps my window, I\
  \ couldn\u2019t describe how beautiful was the view of the ocean, I decided to put\
  \ my summing clothes and go to the beach, for my happiness during the day the bodyguard\
  \ didn\u2019t follow me on the way out. \nWalking throw the beach, surrounded by\
  \ nature I note on African people such tension on their face, I started to become\
  \ curious about those people. Who are they? Why they never smile?\nI sit down on\
  \ the beach and I realized I was the only one tourist there, I could note a small\
  \ boat with three fishermen starring me and trying without success put the boat\
  \ against the strong waves on the sea.\nI went to the bookshop I discovered there\u2019\
  s a tax to buy a book. I spent my last coins on the book about the history of Luanda\
  \ before the colonization.\nI read half of the book and I discovered many things,\
  \ how they have been making effort to survive with less than one dollar per day,\
  \ whats the consequence of Portuguese colonization, two civil war and a pandemia\
  \ of yellow fever. All burned and feed by petrol\u2019s speculation. Boom!\nAnother\
  \ tourist on the hotel lends me some extra Kensas and I was able to pay my taxi\
  \ back to the airport.\nI am still digesting my trip to Angola, and the mix of felling\
  \ Africa brings into my heart. I was not able to write my novel, but something changes\
  \ into me since the reality of this land touched me."
