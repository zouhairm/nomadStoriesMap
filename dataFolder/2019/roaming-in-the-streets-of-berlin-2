Text: "The seat belts allowed our delicate frames little movement. I generally sum\
  \ up those six hours in the bus as a hazy mixture of wild green grass and countless\
  \ sightings of windmills. I entertained myself by heavily eavesdropping on the interaction\
  \ between the Indian and German faculty members. \n\nWhen we finally reached Berlin,\
  \ the teachers hired a tour guide. He stood at the front end of the bus and waved\
  \ his arms continuously. I frantically switched between taking down notes and clicking\
  \ pictures of artistic wall art while the bus turned this way and that. In Berlin,\
  \ the smaller the window, the older the building. I was quite surprised to find\
  \ a fine blend of ancient and contemporary edifices. \n\nPeople from all economic\
  \ and social backgrounds sauntered in the city. I saw men wearing suits, boys in\
  \ cheap shirts, women donning loose dresses, and children dressed up lavishly. The\
  \ city exuded and transmitted a feeling of human celebration. \n\nThe teachers allowed\
  \ us to explore Alexanderplatz and report at a specific place after an hour. We\
  \ walked past a man attracting passers-by by playing his guitar. Shops with vibrant\
  \ items enveloped us completely. \n\nSix of us decided to go inside KaDeWe. Before\
  \ we entered, our Exchange Partners warned us not to purchase anything expensive.\
  \ KaDeWe was the first German shopping mall that surpassed my expectations concerning\
  \ both the variety of available goods and the pricing. After indulging ourselves\
  \ by hungry observation, we left. \n\nI distinctly remember Kathi and Annie rushing\
  \ inside Primark. I had never seen Kathi in such hurry. It was not difficult to\
  \ realise that the goods at Primark were priced reasonably. Annie grabbed clothes\
  \ from the hangers and held them tightly to her chest as if to protect them from\
  \ theft. I started shopping in a few minutes, too.\n\nI couldn\u2019t find any leather\
  \ jacket of my size, and wondered how short people found inexpensive clothes in\
  \ the city. The smallest size available was \u201C36.\u201D The difference in body\
  \ size in India and Germany became clearer. Kathi rescued me from the complication\
  \ and helped me scrutinise a few blue jackets which she herself dismissed quickly.\
  \ We decided to continue our search for my leather jacket back at Munich, and instead\
  \ concentrate our focus on other goods. \n\nI found myself drawn to the section\
  \ having plastic packets containing eight rings. About three rings had a small stone\
  \ of different size attached to the centre. Interestingly, every packet contained\
  \ rings of different sizes. My fetish for rings concluded that I must purchase something\
  \ from the available variety. I scanned through several packets and finally proceeded\
  \ to the counter. \n\nThe busy lady at the counter smiled as I handed her my bundle\
  \ of joy. I suddenly noticed a cardholder beside her computer system. Greeting cards\
  \ were apparently free of cost. I asked her in German to confirm whether they were\
  \ available for free. She nodded. \n\nI delightedly said, \u201CDanke!\u201D She\
  \ distantly replied, \u201CWelcome.\u201D\n\nI picked up two cards when Kathi came\
  \ to me. The sight surprised me: she was holding two big bags overflowing with shopped\
  \ goods. When she revealed that both bags belonged to Annie, I sighed in relief.\
  \ It was hard to imagine Kathi as overindulgent. She was one of my simplest and\
  \ most sophisticated friends. Meanwhile, many of us were disappointed that Annie\
  \ had spent only fifty euros. We were expecting her to splurge more. \n\nOutside\
  \ Primark, we saw Katya arguing with Mr Frank. Mr Frank had allegedly asked the\
  \ German students to prevent buying anything from Primark. The dilapidated state\
  \ of the African children involved in the production of goods was used a pretext.\
  \ Katya began the argument when she observed that Mr Frank had himself bought something\
  \ from Primark. The story about the plight of African children seemed largely untrue\
  \ to me. I wondered whether he had told them so in order to prevent them from wasting\
  \ too much time on shopping. \n\nBefore heading for the hotel, everyone bought a\
  \ D\xF6ner and a diet Coke. D\xF6ner is by far the best delicacy I enjoyed in Germany.\
  \ Its overwhelming taste still resides on the edge of my tongue."
