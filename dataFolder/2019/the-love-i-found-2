Text: "Recession had hit the world and a lot of my friend in US were losing jobs.\
  \ In India I never thought recession would be bad until that day when I was hit\
  \ by it directly. The company I worked for was downsizing and I was asked to resign.\
  \ Nobody expects to lose a job and when one does, it\u2019s a lot of pain, fear\
  \ and anxiety. I on the other hand had no such feelings. Deep down I felt like it\
  \ was a great opportunity to something amazing with my life. I took out most of\
  \ my savings and decided to back pack across northern India. I left for Dharamshala\
  \ four days after my resignation.  Exploring the unknown all by myself was a different\
  \ kind of a high. Uncertainty of the future did make me anxious for sure but then\
  \ I wasn\u2019t ready to ruin my stay in Dharamshala by thinking about something\
  \ that is beyond my control.\n 8 days of absolute bliss is what I experienced in\
  \ Dharamshala post which I had to come to Delhi to attend a wedding. After Delhi,\
  \ my next destination was Leh, Ladakh. Unsure about which route to follow to Leh,\
  \ I decided to stay put in Delhi for one more day. I researched and finally decided\
  \ to do a road trip from Delhi onward. My first stop was Manali. Due to heavy snow\
  \ fall the road to Leh from Manali was shut. So, I had to take the longer route\
  \ to reach Srinagar. The visuals on the way was breathtaking. The weather was nippy\
  \ and cold, an amazing break from the humidity of Mumbai. As the bus moved, the\
  \ landscaped changed rapidly from snow clad mountains to moraines to a valley so\
  \ green and calm, it made me forget all my anxiety and worries. My eyes were glued\
  \ to the view and all I could think of was if I hadn\u2019t lost my job, would I\
  \ ever do something like this? The obvious answer was no, I wouldn\u2019t have dared\
  \ to leave my cozy job. I would have spent my money buying things instead of an\
  \ experience.\nOn the way, I struggled too. Being a vegetarian, my kind of food\
  \ was always difficult to find. But then came Maggi noodles to my rescue. Lugging\
  \ around my extremely heavy bag pack, my petite body would often be in excruciating\
  \ pain at night which aggravated with the cold of the Himalayan weather. \nFinally,\
  \ after a bus journey of 3 days from Manali I reached Leh. I was scouting for suitable\
  \ and safe hotel for myself when I bumped into a very dear friend of mine in the\
  \ middle of a very busy market. Surprised I was to see him, he seemed more relieved\
  \ to see me. I asked about his purpose of being in Leh and he said his purpose was\
  \ me. In the middle of a market, carrying my heavy backpack, I meet a friend who\
  \ was waiting for me from the morning just so that he could talk to me. He had been\
  \ trying to get in touch with me but unfortunately could not due to bad telephone\
  \ network. He called up my elder sister who informed him that I left for Leh and\
  \ I would reach anytime today. He boarded a flight to Leh, reached in the morning\
  \ at around 10 and since then he was wondering around in the market till about 4\
  \ in the evening in the hope that he would meet me. As Rumi  said, \u201CWhat you\
  \ seek is seeking you back,\u201D this line could not have been more apt than this\
  \ very moment. He confessed to me that he was madly in love with me, that he could\
  \ not stay one more day without letting me know how he feels about me. That day,\
  \ that moment standing in the cold, wind slapping hard on the face and the excitement\
  \ of meeting my friend who just told me that he loved me made this travel of mine\
  \ the most memorable one. \nI leaped into the unknown and dated him for 2 years\
  \ before deciding to part ways but till date he is one of my best friends."
