Text: "When you are young you are unstoppable, there are no limits to your passion\
  \ and whatever lies between you and your dreams seems insignificant. The beauty\
  \ of dreams is they are not bound by reality. Practicality takes a back seat when\
  \ your dreams travel far and wide.A thought which one might agree \u201CMountains\
  \ brought me closer to MYSELF\u201D, somehow in those lush green mountains I found\
  \ an endearing paradise.\n\nSo we planned a trip to Leh- Ladakh a converted road\
  \ trip of all time for solace seekers & Adventure enthusiasts. I always wanted to\
  \ have this feather in my cap it was in my bucket list from quite a long time.\n\
  \nLadakh the land of endless discoveries. A traveler will find barren land, desert,\
  \ sedimentary mountains, ample greenery, snowy mountains, everything! Roads of the\
  \ Ladakh valley are a bikers dream. A dream place for mediation, exploration, expedition,\
  \ adventure and solace.\n\nBy any standard and from any perspective, the Leh-Manali\
  \ journey has epic written all over it. With roads that open up for only a few months\
  \ a year, these 470 kms will test you, scare you, shock you and leave you spellbound.\
  \ You will believe life is beautiful!\n\nMy imagination brought me to this road\
  \ many a times yet every time I was close to reaching the destination. I woke up!\
  \ But as the wise says \u201CIf you want something dearly, then the entire universe\
  \ contrives to help you\u201D and today, my dreams, imagination and universe has\
  \ brought me to this road, Road to Ladakh, and this time, its real !\n\nJust imagine\
  \ a unique way to enrich your destiny\u2026 camping in an oasis under the stargazed\
  \ sky, moonlight wine and dine and cool breeze! Ladakh fulfills all your desire.\n\
  \nLadakh gave me memories, experiences and knowledge. It is a place which checks\
  \ your patience, may take a toll on your body but in the end your heart will remember\
  \ the most beautiful sceneries you have ever came across. Cheers!\n\nFighting all\
  \ odd, riding through some of the most dangerous roads in the world, leaving comfortable\
  \ lives and riding in toughest weather that\u2019s what Khardung La is all about.\n\
  \nThis trip has tested us each and every moment and that\u2019s what adventures\
  \ are all about.Ladakh was like a dream come true. It was about the journey and\
  \ not the destination. Road trips are just like life, your dreams are your destinations.\
  \ Embrace them and enjoy them when you finally get there."
