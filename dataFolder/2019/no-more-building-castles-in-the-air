Text: "Years ago in an English  class my  teacher said building castles in the air\
  \ means wishful thinking of impossible things which can never come to be.As I grew\
  \ older my History teacher said most castles belonged to kings and warlords. Recently\
  \ however ,In  Africa,in a once small sleepy remote  village  called Wiumiririe,I\
  \ discovered Tafaria Castle.This one is unique.Less than a decade old as compared\
  \ to most others still standing  a century or more later,it doesn\u2019t trace back\
  \ to any famous warlord ,legendary king or the colonizers .It belongs to an ordinary\
  \ boy,Tafaria Waititu who grew up in this nothing spectacular place  with the hustles\
  \ of lack of water, walking many miles to school,a far away shopping center  and\
  \ health facility crossing valleys and hills,battling wild animals along the way.He\
  \  knew that castles are meant to be build and not be  somewhere lying in the mind\
  \ or rather in the air.He dared to dream about  lighting up his own village, it\
  \ literally  came true  seven years ago  because since the castle was built ,the\
  \ area got connected to the electricity grid-line. In the middle of nowhere,it is\
  \ an oasis of hope for the locals.\nI frequent Wiumiririe  so I always tried fitting\
  \ my visit  to Tafaria Castle into my other plans but it was always elusive,never\
  \  worked out.It  was like a jealous and proud girlfriend  who wanted  all the attention.It\
  \ seemed to be telling me,\u201Dyou know what ,I stay in a castle,you just don't\
  \ play around with royalty,if you want to visit me,plan properly and take your time.I\
  \ don\u2019t share time or resources with anyone or anything.It is all about me.\"\
  I decided enough of the games and it was time to be serious ,man up  and do a real\
  \ chase.I gave it a day of its own no divided attention,specifically from the capital\
  \ city of Kenya,Nairobi  to go there on a four hour journey  and see this beauty.\
  \ \n\nFrom the main highway  a rough road leads there  and for me rough roads mean\
  \ something epic is on the way. The reception has mounted photos of every construction\
  \ milestone  from digging the foundation ,water piping, electricity connection ,\
  \ roofing to the grand opening. Appreciating each step of the journey. I then took\
  \ a round tour. Their rooms have names such as lost knights,vikings and damsels\
  \ pointing  back to war years.Furniture has this antique feel which I find interesting..I\
  \ loved how they had named their meeting room the  think tank;you go in and come\
  \ out with a game plan and something concrete.Outside there is a  memorial stone\
  \ of honour with the names of all those who took part in building the castle from\
  \ the architect  to the plumber to the casuals.Such a nice way of appreciating people\
  \ unlike most places who honour the elite  people who did the grand opening,forgetting\
  \ the many hours of labour that went into building something .Most labour was sourced\
  \ locally thus empowering locals.Most castles have towers,this one  has a plastic\
  \ bottles tower,really tall with a star on top recycling plastics and going green.\
  \ I got to the gym area.It is an outdoor one which I found interesting.They also\
  \ have this seesaw balance,the little things that excite me.Then there is  an art\
  \ gallery promoting local artists ,showcasing their work.Castles must have horses\
  \ and as I was passing the stable,I bumped into this sharp looking middle aged man\
  \ ,he  extended his hand,\u201DHi,I\u2019m Tafaria,welcome\u201C. It caught me off\
  \ guard never expected to meet the dream bearer.It took me back to my  dreams which\
  \  felt  achievable. We did not talk much though.There is a swimming  pool for a\
  \ good dip. I come from Kinangop famous for potatoes and milk,that blood is still\
  \ in me ,in the restaurant I took potato wedges in which had this nice shape and\
  \ their fillet.Someone taking time to decorate  potatoes for me  is touching,I appreciate\
  \ the effort they put in. On stepping out,at night  the castle had lit up,beaming\
  \ with this orange colour through the windows.Royalty doesn't disappoint.This place\
  \ filed me with  motivation that our dreams come true if we work on them,then years\
  \ later looking back they turn into \"ONCE UPON A DREAM \" tales,a tagline written\
  \ on the castle walls making such a statement."
