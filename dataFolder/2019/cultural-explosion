Text: "I could see him scanning me up and down. Leaning against the doors, stroking\
  \ his black moustache unnecessarily. In this room, he was boss and we both knew\
  \ it. I shuffled on the spot, switching gaze to the water pooling beneath the stool\
  \ doors. This room is his kingdom.  \nMy head was swimming and legs throbbing as\
  \ I wrestled the new, thick air, ripe with odour. Quite a change from the steaming\
  \ towel I was handed half an hour ago.\n\u201CHello?!!\u201D \nSnap, back to now.\
  \ His finger was pointing in my direction, accompanied by the impatient glares of\
  \ seven other grown men standing behind me.\n\u201CNext!\u201D\nHe threw his curled\
  \ first over his shoulder with his thumb pointing to furthest stool. \nI stepped\
  \ around the puddles, and closed the door behind me, sliding the bolt. After balancing\
  \ my pack on the flimsy little hook, I spun around only to be greeted with an unfamiliar\
  \ throne. I took my best guess as to how my feet, legs and torso should be oriented\
  \ and I soon found relief.\n As I scurried out of the bathroom, we locked eyes.\
  \ He flicked me a glare as though I had just said something rude about his mother.\
  \ \n\u201CDo they tip here?\u201D I thought to myself. \u201CSurely not in an airport?\u201D\
  \n\u201CPerhaps it's the end of his shift?\u201D\nDXB, Dubai, the hub of the global\
  \ wheel. You could tell most people were used to being no one here, and those that\
  \ came here often, ran the show \u2013 like my friend in the bathroom. \nSpending\
  \ 8 hours in transit, was not the place I was expecting life changing breakthroughs.\
  \ However, until the relief of the bathroom, I hadn\u2019t even paused to think...\
  \ I was completely alone.\nI wasn\u2019t just out for a run around the block alone.\
  \ No, I was 14,233 km away alone. With that thought alone, my pulse quickened and\
  \ breath shortened.\nThere were no other Kiwis to protect me. I ploughed into the\
  \ exchange of thousands of cultures. I never once expected I would watch people\
  \ shop for 40 packs of cigarettes, let alone enjoy it. As the hours whittled away,\
  \ I just continued observing. The thousands of fashions, the way people walked,\
  \ the size of their families, their dialects, their sense of purpose.\n\u201CI need\
  \ to learn more about these people.\u201D I thought\n\u201CNo, not just learn. I\
  \ need to experience their lives.\u201D\n\u201CI need to travel.\u201D\n\u201CPaging\
  \ Mr. Rhys Fitzgerald.\u201D\n\u201CI really need to travel!\u201D"
