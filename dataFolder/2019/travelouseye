Text: "Hello everyone hope you all are fine ., Myself Aayush Rajpurohit and you can\
  \ check it out my profile from Instagram too my I'd name is mr.wild_born ..\nSo\
  \ today I'm going to share my Rajasthan trip with you all.. I stay at Rajasthan\
  \ from 14Jan to 21Jan so from day 1st that was 14Jan 2019 we'll start ...\nOn 14Jan\
  \ 2019 we were ready to go at Rajasthan and yes my trip was road trip and ,I was\
  \ so excited about it . At early morning I woke up at 4am and my parents and me\
  \ were been ready till 6am.. Then there was too many lauggages due to winters and\
  \ any how I managed to fix it in my car . And now my trip begins we were ready and\
  \ we started our trip from my home which is located at Gujarat.My dad was driving\
  \ and he has an habit to drive no stop, and I was seating at front seat and my mom\
  \ was at back seat chilling the climate of joy n happiness.There was an uttarayan\
  \ festival on 14th Jan so the roads were all empty and we reached Ahmedabad at 10'o\
  \ clock in morning and that was so fast and quick , not even too fast ( safety is\
  \ number one priority) and uptill 345km we had not taken an single stop, then after\
  \ in afternoon time we were hungry and we had taken our first stop at hotel and\
  \ had a nice lunch and again we were on our journey to Rajasthan. The climate was\
  \ so joyful n we were super excited about our destination , the climate was peaceful,\
  \ playing nice songs in car and with happy mood all problems were at one corner\
  \ . At nearby 4pm all of a sudden I had an serious headache and my health was too\
  \ low and I was worried that if I'll not recover then how could I enjoyed my trip\
  \ , and I decided to go to doctor as soon as we reach our destination. And we reached\
  \ our destination on 6pm and I dropped my parents to our home (yes we have home\
  \ at Rajasthan too ) and I went for a hospital , I was not familiar about a good\
  \ hospital and had no idea about which doctor is good n bad , I reached one on the\
  \ hospital n booked my appointment n as my turn came I went inside , doctor checked\
  \ me n I told doctor to give me injection because there was a function on next day\
  \ for which I was so excited n went at Rajasthan (will let you know for what I went\
  \ at Rajasthan in next blog ) now there was a funniest part n strange too , Doctor\
  \ told me did u came with your family member I told no , and he was like I'll not\
  \ give you a injection without your family member that answer was so shocking for\
  \ me because I go with my family member at hospital n I had many injection without\
  \ them too . I tried to convince him but he didn't , and I told to give a strong\
  \ antibiotics so that I can be cured as soon as possible. And I went away from that\
  \ place and came back to home. Took my medicines on time and had a sleep.\nThen\
  \ after what happened will let you know in next blog . Keep on reading , keep on\
  \ visiting for excited trip of mine .\nInstagram I'd :- mr.wild_born \nFacebook\
