Text: "I came to Bosnia to see and experience the pyramid of the sun in Visoko. \n\
  \nMy trip in Sarajevo started on an \u2018off\u2019 vibe; I felt as if in an inhospitable\
  \ environment. Hotel room no good. Staff no good. Weather no good. Then I got kicked\
  \ out of a tram because my ticket was no good.\n\nThe tram incident was the tipping\
  \ point; I missed my bus to Visoko and the pyramids. I sat down and decided to just\
  \ take a chill pill; I was definitely missing something here, I could feel that\
  \ I was swimming upstream.\nForced to give up on the Pyramid plan for the day I\
  \ decided to give Sarajevo a chance regardless of our rocky start. I thought there\
  \ maybe was a higher reason stopping me from reaching Visoko. \n\nGiving in to the\
  \ city\u2019s energy I let her guide me: I looked at no maps. Just followed my senses.\
  \ \nI soon walked in a park commemorating the children killed in the Sarajevo siege\
  \ 1992-95. It\u2019s only 23 years ago that there were shells flying right here!\
  \ Mass murdering of innocent people was happening right here. \nSomeone had placed\
  \ a bouquet of fresh flowers on the water fountain. Close by there was an older\
  \ couple silently weeping, holding hands. \n\nIt didn\u2019t take long to start\
  \ seeing the message Sarajevo was adamant in communicating to me. The city wasn\u2019\
  t going to let me do anything else in this country until I would understand properly\
  \ what was going on here and why. The hopelessness. The aggression. The palpable\
  \ pain that the people carry with them. And there I was, complaining. Seriously.\n\
  \u201COh you don\u2019t like your hotel room?\u201D *uck you, Maya. I mean for real.\
  \ \n\nI was deeply moved and continued my tour around the city already in a smoother,\
  \ more empathetic vibe. The weather improved. After my silent moment in the park,\
  \ the city saw I was ready to take in the reality a little deeper. It led me to\
  \ a museum for crimes against humanity, displaying some of the monstrosities that\
  \ the Bosnian genocide was made of. \nTorture devices and stories from the survivors.\
  \ Video footage rolling, people in a horrendous condition in detention camps. Killing.\
  \ Weapons. Items hanging on the walls, dug up from mass graves. \n\nMass. Graves.\n\
  \nWhile I got to live a calm childhood with my family intact, all this was happening.\
  \ \n\nI was unhinged and teary throughout walking in the exhibit, but the city held\
  \ me. She urged me to try and really feel so I kept on; seeing and feeling the horrendous\
  \ exhibit part by part. Humans can be monsters. \n\nThe lies we are told by the\
  \ powers that be are so clear in my eyes now. They preach for peace but prepare\
  \ for war. And if there is one thing I have learned is that what we are preparing\
  \ for will happen. \n\nToday there was a beautiful sunshine out there and I am typing\
  \ this in an excellent mood after a day at the remarkable Pyramid Of The Sun, no\
  \ complications all day... Sarajevo approved of me going there since early morning.\
  \ I got what I wanted and so much more.\n\nThank you Sarajevo for \u2018detaining\u2019\
  \ me yesterday. I am sure you would have kept me as long as you needed to. Until\
  \ I understood. \n\nLet there be tranquility on all that suffered here. Let the\
  \ souls of those we\u2019ve lost rest in peace. Let this never happen again."
