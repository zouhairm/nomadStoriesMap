Text: "Having just spent two months in South Africa, where I had heard gunshots every\
  \ night outside of my accommodation and seen one of my friends come back home with\
  \ a stab wound, I was more than wary of stranger-danger when I arrived as a solo\
  \ traveller in Tanzania. With a large rucksack on my back I hopped on the back of\
  \ a decrepit motorcycle and took the 40 minute journey to the last-minute Airbnb\
  \ I had booked in Dar es Salaam. Originally I had planned to volunteer for two weeks\
  \ on a farm, but unfortunately my host had stopped communicating with me so I had\
  \ to amend my plans right before I landed. Soon the broken roads turned to dirt\
  \ and the concrete buildings turned to lush green with houses made from wood and\
  \ mud scattered throughout. Arriving at my accommodation I was met by Rashidi, a\
  \ twenty-something year old man, as well as his seven year old daughter Nuru, and\
  \ I knew I was in good hands.\n\nAs we took the five minute stroll to the beach\
  \ Rashidi pointed out the best places to get \u2018Kuku na chips\u2019, avocados\
  \ the size of my head, and the greasiest but most satisfying flat breads you\u2019\
  ve ever tasted. With a conversion rate of \xA31 to 3500 tzs, I was able to eat like\
  \ a king - a big relief as I\u2019d spent most of my money in South Africa. I couldn\u2019\
  t help but notice the sea of gazes as I walked through town and Rashidi explained\
  \ to me that not many \u2018Mzungus\u2019 (white people) came through these areas,\
  \ and suddenly I had a group of children run up to me to hold my hand as we walked\
  \ back home. Lying in bed that night I could hear the hustle and bustle of the area;\
  \ music blasted from speakers; adults and children laughing; the crash of the waves\
  \ as well as the all too familiar hum of the thousands of mosquitos desperately\
  \ trying to get at me - lucky I had a net covering my bed. My first day in Tanzania\
  \ left me hungry to explore more.\n\nWaking up to the clucking of Rashidi\u2019\
  s chickens, I packed my bag with my phone, kindle, knife that I had bought as a\
  \ precaution in South Africa, and a few thousand shilling and headed to beach. The\
  \ cool sea breeze was a welcome relief from the over 30 degree celsius heat and\
  \ the white sand tickled as it passed through my toes. I set up about 10 minutes\
  \ away from the beach entrance and began to relax. This however did not last long\
  \ as I noticed a scraggly-looking man making his way towards me. My months in South\
  \ Africa had prepared me for a moment like this. I was getting ready to make a hasty\
  \ escape when he asked if he could sit down. I said yes and he introduced himself\
  \ as Muhammed, telling me all about how he was a homeless recovering drug addict\
  \ (of every drug available in the area) who was going around the beach trying to\
  \ help others who were addicts themselves. Whilst this wasn\u2019t the best way\
  \ to introduce oneself, we continued chatting and we must have spoken for hours\
  \ about the beach, the sea, his life, my life, and really anything and everything\
  \ we could think of. He told me about the \u2018tourist\u2019 part of the beach\
  \ and as we walked there I offered to buy him a Coke, which he vehemently refused.\
  \ After some convincing he allowed me to buy him one. After talking about how beautiful\
  \ the sun looked as it was setting over the sea, I realised that Rashidi was probably\
  \ worried about me so we headed back to the beach entrance and Muhammad asked if\
  \ I was going to come back to the beach tomorrow, an offer I couldn\u2019t refuse.\n\
  \nEvery day of my trip I went to that beach, and Muhammad was just one of the many\
  \ amazing, friendly people I met. A stark contrast to my experience in South Africa,\
  \ I left Tanzania with many new friends and many more many amazing memories of Tanzania,\
  \ Rashidi, Muhammad, and everyone else I met during my stay."
