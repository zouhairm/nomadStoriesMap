Text: "I didn't know what to expect as I opened the Khonglah family fridge but to\
  \ my delight I wasn't disappointed. Eggs, milk and butter, they were all there.\
  \ I grabbed half a dozen eggs and the entire jug of milk; they were a big family\
  \ compared to mine so it was only logical to triple the batch. I placed the ingredients\
  \ on the marbled kitchen island and prepared to scavenge for the flour that I presumed\
  \ hid in one of the white cupboards above the kitchen counter. It had been Lisa\u2019\
  s brother-in-law, Topi, that had suggested we eat tungrymbai for dinner as it had\
  \ been a staple food for him whilst growing up. \u201CTogether with some homemade\
  \ roti\u201D he stated, \u201Cit is a traditional meal in every Khasi household.\u201D\
  \ Since I had been given the opportunity to try something the Khonglah family had\
  \ been eating for several generations, I was eager to give them a similar experience\
  \ but from my side of the world. I just had to find that flour.\n\nBeing a guest\
  \ of the Khonglah family was never my intention when I purchased my last minute\
  \ ticket to Meghalaya, or \u201Cabode above the clouds\u201D as it was commonly\
  \ referred to based on its Sanskrit meaning. I was initially heading to Cherrapunji,\
  \ a small village in the region known for its living root bridges and intense amount\
  \ of rainfall. However, in order to get to this lush, mountainous hamlet, I first\
  \ had to pass through Shillong, the state\u2019s capital.\n\nIt was late in the\
  \ evening when the plane landed at Umroi Domestic Airport, roughly thirty kilometres\
  \ from Shillong\u2019s central district. Although it was dark and foggy when I arrived,\
  \ I could still see how different this region was in comparison with the India that\
  \ I had experienced so far. What caught me off guard at first was the chilly air\
  \ that filled my lungs and formed clouds of steam with every breath that I took\
  \ in the midnight sky. For the first time in several weeks, there was silence. No\
  \ honking. No bells ringing. No street vendors. Just any eerie form of silence that\
  \ lingered mystically over the sleeping town. \n\n\u201CHey you! Blond girl! Want\
  \ to share a cab?\u201D \nAn eccentric looking woman was waving energetically towards\
  \ me, her silver bangles chiming through the quietude. With no prior plans of transportation\
  \ at hand, I approached the woman in the black jeep and jumped in. \n\u201CLisa\u201D\
  \ she said as she stretched out her hand towards me in a greeting.\n\u201CMel\u201D\
  \ I replied, shaking her hand and making her bangles jingle vigorously.\n\u201C\
  Where are you staying?\u201D she asked.\n\u201CI don\u2019t know yet.\u201D I answered\
  \ dumbly, \u201CCity centre I suppose. There ought to be a hostel open at this hour.\u201D\
  \n\u201CI doubt anything is open darling but maybe you can stay with us?\u201D \n\
  As the black jeep rolled through the night, Lisa on the phone with her family and\
  \ me staring out into the darkness, I couldn\u2019t help but question what I was\
  \ getting myself into. Could I really trust this stranger?\n\nThe sound of batter\
  \ upon the hot frying pan and the smell that wafted through the house must have\
  \ reached upstairs since Daniel, the youngest son in the family, was already on\
  \ his way down to the kitchen despite the early hour. \n\u201CWhat are you making!?\u201D\
  \ he asked enthusiastically as he watched the pancake turn a slight yellow before\
  \ it was time to flip it over.\n\u201CPancakes. But the Swedish kind.\u201D I said.\
  \ \u201CThey\u2019re extra thin, similar to crepes.\u201D\nDaniel grinned and nodded\
  \ approvingly.\n\nBy the time the last pancake was cooking, the entire Khonglah\
  \ family had gathered in the kitchen to taste the pancakes which I had now filled\
  \ with berry jam and whipped cream. Everyone in the family, especially the children,\
  \ loved the pancakes. However, despite Topi\u2019s generous compliments on the breakfast\
  \ I still believed he preferred the fermented soy beans in his tungrymbai. As we\
  \ sat there together, eating, laughing and chatting away I couldn\u2019t have felt\
  \ more at home. I had found a second family on the other side of the globe all thanks\
  \ to the openness and generosity that ran through the Khonglah veins."
