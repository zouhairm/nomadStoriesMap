Text: "I was 24 and had I had never been out of the country. \nMy family didn't travel\
  \ much growing up; we went to Kauai and Florida but aside from that, Disneyland\
  \ was our usual destination. I grew up with high anxiety and a crippling fear of\
  \ flying. I attended a college nearby so I would not have to worry about a commute\
  \ home that involved airports. \nAs I grew older, my yearning to see the world grew,\
  \ and I realized I would have to conquer my fear of flying if I wanted to have a\
  \ life worth living. \nI tagged along on my friend's trip to Europe last minute.\
  \ We were going to Norway, Sweden, and Denmark, and I was so excited I could hardly\
  \ wait. I had a decent amount of anxiety about the flight, as I had never been on\
  \ a flight near that long before. Luckily, I remember we cut our time a little close\
  \ on the way to the airport that I didn't have much time to think and we had to\
  \ breeze through security and almost head straight onto the plane. \nFortunately,\
  \ our flight was as smooth as can be, and I couldn't believe I was in a different\
  \ country. Europe was a dream to me. I was so enamored with being in a completely\
  \ new place, where the language was not my own and the surroundings and ways of\
  \ life were also new. Even the public transportation was exciting to me! \nOut of\
  \ the three countries we visited, Sweden was my favorite. It was freezing when we\
  \ went; the temperature never went past 40 degrees Fahrenheit. I was a little bummed\
  \ we were not able to do any of the summertime activities, but the city was just\
  \ as beautiful in the winter. The architecture was breathtaking; California had\
  \ nothing close. I especially enjoyed Gamla Stan, with the cobble stone streets\
  \ and incredible, colorful buildings. I went to the ABBA museum on my own (my friends\
  \ had no interest) and I had a blast singing along to my favorite songs. I never\
  \ wanted my trip to end.\nWhile I had an amazing time in Europe, the trip only whetted\
  \ my appetite for travel and adventure and I have been dying to go back ever since.\
  \ I have done extensive research and planning, trying to save to return. My dream\
  \ would be to live in Europe so I would be able to venture to all the countries\
  \ I have been dreaming about. I am determined to make this a reality; I truly feel\
  \ like I belong there. Portugal is at the top of my list, and when I saw this contest,\
  \ I knew it was meant to be. If granted this opportunity, it would change my life\
  \ and I know I would thrive. And probably never live in America again!"
