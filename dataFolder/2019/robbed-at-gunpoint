Text: "Two weeks after I returned home from a trip to Australia I was off again on\
  \ another adventure. I was going to explore Medell\xEDn, Colombia. Every person\
  \ I mentioned the location of this trip to developed a sudden look of concern, like\
  \ Colombia was a dirty word, however I shrugged it off. I expected a similar experience\
  \ to all my other travels. People all over the world are always kind, generous and\
  \ surprisingly welcoming. The only difference for this trip, as far as I could imagine,\
  \ was that I was going to officiate my first wedding. \n     My best friend from\
  \ high school was marrying a man who was born in Colombia but who had been adopted\
  \ as a child and raised in the U.S. They recently had reconnected with his biological\
  \ family on their travels and for several reasons decided to have the ceremony in\
  \ Medell\xEDn. Weddings are all about family, so I also brought my Mom along for\
  \ the ride. We love to hike and the day after we arrived my friend had an excursion\
  \ planned for a group of 26 of us Americans. \n     The plan was to take the metro\
  \ to what appeared to me to be similar to a National Park- Arv\xED Regional Park.\
  \ I had looked it up online and read about the Gondola ride up the mountainside\
  \ to this magical-sounding place for Ecotourism. On our way thru the city the views\
  \ outside the windows flashed by and appeared so surreal they could easily have\
  \ been from a movie scene. The landscape went from sheer wealth to absolute poverty\
  \ within minutes and very few miles. The people of Medell\xEDn were just as varied\
  \ and many of them appeared stunningly beautiful. A baby held by her mother on the\
  \ bus seemed to be just as enraptured by the looks of me and this brief moment felt\
  \ like love but was based only on sight and fortunately required no language translation.\
  \ \n    The day continued to unfold beyond expectations. Backpacks were worn on\
  \ the front of people in our group and someones purse had been tugged at by a stranger\
  \ on the metro. Caution was the word and keeping valuables out of sight and close\
  \ by was highly recommended. The park appeared to be a safe place with lots of trails\
  \ and we only had an hour to explore them. The plan was to meet back up and leave\
  \ the park together (for safety reasons) before rush-hour hit the city. \n     People\
  \ from all different walks of life were wandering around the park and it felt so\
  \ normal to what popular tourist destinations are like. My Mom and I quickly found\
  \ a trail and admired the various flowers, rocks and plants we had never seen before\
  \ as we walked along. We passed by other couples and people from the wedding party,\
  \ then we turned around to head back up the trail to our scheduled meeting place.\
  \ \n     I was looking at a trail map on my phone when suddenly a young man appeared\
  \ out of the jungle crouched low wearing camouflage pants and a black face mask.\
  \ He proceeded up the trail towards us quickly. We looked at him and said hello,\
  \ thinking he was just a kid who was playing some kind of game when we saw his weapon.\
  \ He ripped my phone out of my hand and waved his gun at us while speaking rapidly\
  \ in Spanish, he unzipped my Mother's pockets and stole her phone too. Reality was\
  \ warped and time stood still as his nervous glances up the trail met our pleads.\
  \ He left with all the cash but gave back the passport and backpack. We screamed\
  \ as he ran off into the bushes hoping someone we knew was nearby to help us. \n\
  \     This could have happened anywhere but I didn't expect to find him to be so\
  \ beautiful even though he was a thief. We were unharmed and although it was quite\
  \ a shock I still think Medell\xEDn is a captivating place. The wedding was gorgeous,\
  \ the whole experience unforgettable (for everyone) as later on we danced all night\
  \ on the Chiva while locals jaw's dropped as they watched us go by on the party\
  \ bus."
