Text: "June 20th. In a sunny Milan, the city that had been my home for two years,\
  \ I completed my Master and graduated. Immediately after, I was offered an unpaid\
  \ internship position in a very important university in Liverpool. That year my\
  \ family was stroke by my father\u2019s illness and a consequent economic crisis\
  \ that made it difficult for me to leave and go abroad. I got in panic, I had traveled\
  \ a lot in my life and I didn\u2019t want to stop. So I worked all the summer just\
  \ to get money to start that experience and after many nights without sleeping,\
  \ I left.\nIt was the night of October 13th, the air was warm but humid. I was looking\
  \ at people from the car\u2019s window and I had the feeling it was a simple night\
  \ for everyone, except for me. My father dropped me off at the station platform,\
  \ he hugged me and I felt all the desperation and love of the world. Then the train\
  \ whistled and it was time to leave.\nI arrived in Liverpool on a classic English\
  \ rainy day not so usual for an Italian girl. The grey sky and light rain were reflecting\
  \ my mood. Outside the airport, my attention fell on the yellow submarine\u2019\
  s monument, the one from the famous Beatles\u2019 song. Liverpool was their city.\
  \ While the taxi accompanied me to what would have been my home, I noticed a lot\
  \ of semi-detached houses, each layout was a mirror image of the other, with very\
  \ pretty gardens, full of flowers. \nAfter the first night without blankets (my\
  \ package had not arrived), I started my university internship (the one of my dreams!).\
  \ In the morning, from the double-decker bus, everything seemed like in the movies.\
  \ The sky was grey but it wasn\u2019t raining, people around me were speaking with\
  \ a weird English accent.  When you are abroad and you meet a person from your country,\
  \ it\u2019s as if you already knew each other. Maybe that\u2019s why that day, an\
  \ Italian boy approached me and, almost reading in my mind, said: \u201CDon\u2019\
  t worry if you can\u2019t understand: they speak a local dialect\u201D. I was hopeless.\n\
  Unexpectedly, bringing curriculum vitae to restaurants and bars in order to get\
  \ a job was a unique experience, accompanied by the music of the Beatles, surrounded\
  \ by thousands of unknown faces that seemed not so different from mine. I went to\
  \ the Dock, the famous port of Liverpool, where the air was colder and the wind\
  \ was brushing your hair. \nAfter a week I got my first interview. That morning\
  \ I left the house very early, the sky was grey as usual, but lighter clouds framed\
  \ the sky. The workplace was near the city\u2019s most famous park, Sefton Park.\
  \ Walking through the trees of that immense expanse that almost out of tune with\
  \ Liverpool, I saw a squirrel on a tree, I approached it, but it ran away. Before\
  \ entering the hotel, I turned around again, that lawn was green, hopeful green.\
  \ That day I got a job.\nMarch 1st. Today I\u2019m writing from my English room.\
  \ In a month I will have completed my internship and I will have to leave my job\
  \ at the hotel. My heart is shaking. I became fond of the grey sky of England, of\
  \ the smell of fries between the shelves of shops and this particular accent resounds\
  \ in my head every day. I learned to ask \u201Chow are you\u201D even to strangers,\
  \ I know all the names of British beers and whiskeys and my favorite hour is that\
  \ of tea. I love going to the port or the park, listening Beatles\u2019 songs, because\
  \ there is nothing more beautiful than seeing the blue color of the water or the\
  \ green hope of the lawn against the grey sky. \nThe best thing that could happen\
  \ to you is shuffling your surroundings, waking up in cities that you don\u2019\
  t know and having conversations in languages you cannot entirely understand. It\
  \ doesn\u2019t matter if you don\u2019t have the money or if you don\u2019t feel\
  \ ready, be curious about everything, work hard, enjoy it and you will be paid back!\
  \ Quoting Beatles: \u201C..just let it be\u201D."
