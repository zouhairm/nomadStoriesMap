Text: "On my childhood without Internet access, I had already made fabulous journeys\
  \ through the pages of history books and I had an undeniable admiration for Egypt\
  \ because of its rich history. \nThe mixture of fascination and admiration increased\
  \ more in the 2000s, when through the internet I have got a message from an egyptian\
  \ man with who I kept in touch for 4 years until finally we decided to know each\
  \ other facet to face  and in this moment I already considered him more than only\
  \ a friend for me.\nAs a leap into the unknown, I traveled to Egypt. The trip was\
  \ very long and started in Palmas/TO - Brazil, where I live, I waited so much time\
  \ in each airport, first in Bras\xEDlia/DF, then in Guarulhos - S\xE3o Paulo, both\
  \ in Brazil, and Rome in Italy. I expected to live an adventure because that was\
  \ my first trip alone, I felt a mix of emotions, especially anxiety.\nIn the flight\
  \ from Rome to Cairo, everything around me pay my attention, from the way people\
  \ dressed until the unknown language they spoke to.\nWhen I landed in Cairo Airoport,\
  \ I had difficulty for understanding what the immigration agents were saying, but\
  \ thanks to the help of a Portuguese couple of tourists, I was able to carry out\
  \ the immigration procedures and collect my luggage.\nStill at the airport for my\
  \ surprise nobody was waiting for me and I had forgotten my mobile in Brazil. My\
  \ virtual friend made a mistake and he was waiting for me in different terminal.\
  \ I That sitatuion was very unconfortavel for me, so I took a taxi and went to a\
  \ hotel, on the way I was very scared, I thought about a lot of things cause I was\
  \ facing the unknown alone for knowing an unknown person that I only knew virtually.\n\
  When I arrived at the hotel, with internet access I contacted my friend and he explained\
  \ his mistake, then he came to  me. I spent 15 days in his family house what allowed\
  \ me to know the customs and traditions a typical Egyptian family.\nDuring these\
  \ days, I was able to get to know some places in Cairo and everything awake my attention:\
  \ chaotic traffic, where old and new cars mix with other means of transport like\
  \ carts and colorful tuk tuk; the landscape no so much green due to existence cause\
  \ there is no so much trees in the city if we compare with brazilian cities; women\
  \ with their long clothing and veils covering their head; the difference of language\
  \ and local food; the architecture with visible contrast between the modern and\
  \ the old buildings and houses.\nIn Giza, I was surprised by the grandeur of the\
  \ sphinx and the pyramids (Cheops, Khafre and Miquerin).\nI really was having a\
  \ great life experience full of adventures, but I didn\u2019t expect to find love.\
  \ I didnt't expect the virtual love become reality and that man become my husband\
  \ and with him I had two children, my great accomplishment. \nThanks God as we can\
  \ say in arabic \"maktub\", it already was written."
