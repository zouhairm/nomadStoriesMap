Text: "It was our third day in Puerto Rico, and we were ready for an adventure. The\
  \ previous day had been disappointing because we had gotten lost; my partner insisted\
  \ that I use a map from the 70\u2019s. So yes, a day trip to Vieques for the rare\
  \ bioluminescent bays seemed like the perfect pick-me-up.\n\nWe boarded the ferry,\
  \ landed on the small island by mid-morning, and entered a world 50 years behind\
  \ the mainland. As self-proclaimed \u201Ctour haters,\u201D we messed up. The tours\
  \ did not begin until 6pm, and the last ferry back to the mainland left at 6:30pm.\
  \ We were on an island with no transportation, no plans, and no idea where the rest\
  \ of civilization  was . My partner decided to stop by a nearby gift shop for advice,\
  \ and that was when we met Rob and Emily.\n\nThis eccentric, New Yorker couple wasn\u2019\
  t exactly how we pictured the locals, and they began to tell us their love story.\
  \ They met when he mistook her for his employee and berated her; she defied science\
  \ to save his life; and after four months of dating, they left everything behind\
  \ to live the island lifestyle. I had never met two happier people.\n\nAfter describing\
  \ our dilemma, they looked at each other, looked at us, and looked at each other\
  \ again. Emily mumbled \u201Cdon\u2019t you dare do this again.\u201D Ignoring her,\
  \ Rob invited us into their world. He said that there was an extra room in their\
  \ home; he had extra scuba gear to take us to the \u201Clocals-only\u201D beach;\
  \ his friend owned his own BioBay tour company; and they would be happy to be our\
  \ local guides.\n\nMy partner and I looked at each other, looked at them, and looked\
  \ at each other again. Now, I am a spontaneous person. However, my partner would\
  \ not trust Gandhi, so he is sure as hell not going to trust two strangers on a\
  \ barely-populated island 20 miles off the coast of Puerto Rico. After some intense\
  \ conversation, we walked back into the store and he said \u201Cwe accept your terms\
  \ on one condition - do you have an extra toothbrush?\u201D\n\nOnce loaded with\
  \ scuba gear, we made our way to Sun Bay Beach. The \u201Cpier\u201D was a network\
  \ of perpendicular wooden planks suspended 20 feet above the water. After walking\
  \ (read: crawling) the plank, we realized that the conditions were terrible for\
  \ scuba, so our hosts decided to take us to the Island\u2019s best hike (Cayo Tierra).\n\
  \nAlong the way up the trail, we learned quite a bit about our mysterious host,\
  \ his previous wife, his day-to-day life, and the history of the island. Mosquito\
  \ Bay, the famous BioBay we could see from our perch, was named after the Robin\
  \ Hood of pirate\u2019s boat (El Mosquito) and not the pesky bloodsuckers.\n\nBy\
  \ nightfall, we met our fellow adventurers at the mouth of the bay. Our local tour\
  \ guide and Rob\u2019s best friend greeted us with kayaks. Once we paddled away\
  \ from the city lights, the water began to glow. With each stroke of our oars, millions\
  \ of tiny critters released their electricity. Their protective adaptations are\
  \ chemically identical to Fireflies, and each one only has a single burst of \u201C\
  light\u201D every 24 hours. Every fish that swam by created a streak of neon blue.\
  \ Every splash of water glowed. Every time my hand grazed the water, it sparkled.\
  \ There are only five Bioluminescent Bays in the world, and Rob and Emily had given\
  \ us a magical gift.\n\nAfter leaving the neon water and taking a few of the glittering\
  \ creatures as souvenirs, Emily was waiting to drive us home. That night, we ate\
  \ around the kitchen table sharing stories, adventures, and laughter with our family\
  \ of strangers.\n\nAfter a round of hugs and endless expressions of gratitude the\
  \ next morning, we left the island behind, thankful for these kind strangers who\
  \ happened to have a spare toothbrush."
