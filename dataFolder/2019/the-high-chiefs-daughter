Text: "Being a chief/matai\u2019s daughter comes with great expectations and responsibilities.\
  \ Ava (Avali\u2019i), the second eldest of the three sisters has an issue with her\
  \ father being the king or high chief in the village of manunu, Sapunaoa. Ava is\
  \ told to follow her older sister Sina\u2019s footstep and be an epitome of a great\
  \ leader. Sina is head strong, passionate, and always making good choices to protect\
  \ her village. However Ava has never thought of herself as a leader but someone\
  \ who is able to care and lookout for her village people in a humbling way. She\
  \ never thought of herself any higher than anyone in the village. While her father\
  \ and sister sina travel to town for the government \u2018Mau movement\u2019 meetings,\
  \ Ava will be at home helping her mother Tafale prepare dinner for their arrival.\
  \ Her younger sister Miri (Miriama) will be out attending the local church volley\
  \ ball games. Miri is the youngest so she gets away with anything. \n\nAva\u2019\
  s whole world turns when she sees a European white male figure walking into the\
  \ village gates side by side with her father. A handsome blue eyed man, tall and\
  \ bulked. His brunette hair shines with the reflection of the sun. Wearing his blue\
  \ alo\u2019a while the village ladies fa\u2019aula him with flower necklaces. \n\
  \nDuring the ceremony for his arrival, all the men and women of the village gathered\
  \ around in the fale o\u2019o for his welcoming. Matai men sitting around forming\
  \ a circle for the traditional Samoan ava ceremony. While the women were preparing\
  \ the umu and the mealofa for our guest, my sister and I were arguing who would\
  \ have to do the taupou siva. \n\n\u201CFather said you have to step up. This is\
  \ your chance to impress him\u201D says Sina,\n\n\u201CBut Sina, you know how shy\
  \ I am, I\u2019m not even good at siva Samoa\u201D cries Ava,\n\nSina cups both\
  \ her hands on Ava\u2019s shoulders and makes eye contact \u201CSissy! Calm down,\
  \ you can do this, our ancestors will guide you. Breathe okay, I\u2019ll be right\
  \ here. Just look at me when you\u2019re confused. I\u2019ll be right here to help\
  \ you okay?\u201D \n\nSina and her mother prepare Ava for her Siva Samoa (Traditional\
  \ Taupou dance) where the high chiefs daughter dances for the guest. They rub baby\
  \ oil/fagu\u2019u onto her fare soft skin, twirled the ie koga around her body,\
  \ a boob tube ie that ends just above her knees showing off her malu (Samoan traditional\
  \ tattoo for women) placed a beautiful tuiga on her head, put a nifo ula (necklace)\
  \ around her neck and a few taulima (bracelet) on both arms. Tafale cried seeing\
  \ her 21 year old daughter in a taupou laei. \n\n\u201CYou look aulelei. Pei ia\
  \ oe se teine Samoa\u201D Tafale says with emotion and kisses her on the forehead,\n\
  \n\u201CThank you mum, I\u2019m really nervous\u201D Ava replies \n\n\u201CSissy\
  \ you\u2019ll be fine, okay it\u2019s almost time\u201D Sina demands and helps her\
  \ get ready for her entrance\n\nAva stood there waiting, she could see the amount\
  \ of people she will have to perform infront of. She looks straight ahead and sees\
  \ the handsome European white man and starts to drift away in his blue eyes ...\
  \ \n\n\u201CAva! Go, AVA! ...\u201D Sina loudly whispers, \n\n\u201COh, that\u2019\
  s my cue...\u201D Ava clicks \n\nWhile the song starts playing and the village people\
  \ started to sing \u201CFALEALILI UMA, I OU MALO ...\u201D Ava started to gracefully\
  \ run in doing the traditional tamo\u2019e. When she reaches infront of the visitor\
  \ she stops, bows three times and starts with her taupou moves. Her hands so gentle\
  \ smooth as she dances. When she se\u2019es it looks as if she is flying with the\
  \ amount of oil that is on the ground making it easier for her to travel. \n\nWhile\
  \ she is dancing, Andrew is amazed at her movements and her beauty. She sure has\
  \ captured his heart. While everyone is dancing around her hyping her up, he is\
  \ stunned he\u2019s never seen someone so beautiful. After the siva, when Ava went\
  \ back to change, he asked to meet her. \n\nWhile Ava was hanging her washing she\
  \ heard someone from behind say,\n\n\u201CYou danced so beautifully\u201D Andrew\
  \ says with charm,\n\n\u201COh, thank you\u201D she blushes."
