Text: "I had picked a random date for my trip which just happened to coincide with\
  \ the 40th anniversary of the May '68 protests. That\u2019s how naive my travelling\
  \ was back then and how lucky I\u2019ve always been. All the museums I wanted to\
  \ visit in expensive Paris on a tight Argentinian budget just happened to be free\
  \ when I was there. Outdoor installations, photography exhibitions, live music,\
  \ and lots of park life. I had long warm days to roam around and eat sandwiches\
  \ sitting on benches, and every now and then I even treated myself to cr\xEApes\
  \ en terrace. As the days rolled by, I was growing confident in the museum scene\
  \ and I finally got the hang of the underground. I felt so clever, so Paris savvy,\
  \ so proud of my French.\n\nThat day was the turn of the Cit\xE9 des sciences et\
  \ de l\u2019industrie. I took the subway to Porte de la Vilette. The museum was\
  \ conveniently close to the station but I got wet through anyway as it was coming\
  \ down like crazy after a week straight of perfect sunny weather. After four hours\
  \ I had the feeling I had already explored every area of the museum; I had been\
  \ up and down those escalators a million times and pushed every button there was\
  \ to be pushed. I had even shamelessly played around in the children's area. I was\
  \ exhausted. But the museum was there for me for free until 6pm. I just had to keep\
  \ going. Besides, I had nothing else to do except wait out the rain.\n\nI remembered\
  \ the words that had caught my eye the second I had entered the building: \"Vestiaires\
  \ niveau 0\". Among all the different things you could do there, you could also\
  \ visit the vestiaires. My imagination had run rampant after so much exploration\
  \ and experimentation so I decided to give the vestiaires a chance to blow my mind\
  \ even further.\n\nAs I approached the mysterious exhibit, I began to catch on what\
  \ had happened. The man ceremoniously slipping raincoats off their hangers, for\
  \ reasons unknown to me at the time, reminded me of a short story by Cort\xE1zar.\
  \ Years later I understood how me and my conational had probably been seduced by\
  \ the same word in the same city, only Julio had ended up writing a masterpiece\
  \ and Julia had ended up making a fool of herself in a museum cloakroom without\
  \ any items to check."
