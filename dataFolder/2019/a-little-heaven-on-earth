Text: "HOLA! Don\u2019t worry, I\u2019m not going to speak Spanish, that\u2019s the\
  \ word I\u2019m used to saying to myself when I arrive in my favorite places. This\
  \ time let me introduce you to one of my favorite places in Indonesia. Yes, Indonesia\
  \ has many beautiful places to explore, if you love the ocean, the mountains, the\
  \ foods, culture, and traditions, we have them all. So, Welcome to Yogyakarta. Why\
  \ Yogyakarta? It\u2019s not because my aunt lives here, but if you love foods, art,\
  \ and unique things, nature, people, or trying something you couldn\u2019t find\
  \ in your city, you\u2019d better come here. Ps: all things are cheaper rather than\
  \ Bali or Bandung. \n\nIn Yogyakarta, I stayed in 4 stars hotel. The hotel location\
  \ was in the heart of Yogyakarta. It\u2019s a very nice, elegance, classic but modern\
  \ hotel. 5 minutes\u2019 walk to the famous street in Yogyakarta, Malioboro. I love\
  \ staying there, so comfortable. Walked out from the hotel with my sister, we found\
  \ so many art shops and food streets just right in front of the hotel, crowded at\
  \ night because many people love to try \u201Clesehan\u201D on the street. Lesehan\
  \ means you can eat some food by sitting on the floor/street using a small table.\
  \ I recommend you try gudeg with chicken, egg satay, spicy kerecek, mendoan, and\
  \ fried cow lung. Yummy! The portion was enough for me. Ps: I\u2019m a foodie. So,\
  \ my portion may be different from yours. \n\nMy sister and I visited many local\
  \ art shops and went to Borobudur temple in Magelang, The largest Buddhist temple\
  \ in the world \u2013 UNESCO World Heritage Site, and Gerojokan sewu waterfall in\
  \ Surakarta. My cousin asked her friend who has a rental company to accompany us.\
  \ From him, we know that it\u2019s not just a waterfall, some people said that if\
  \ we wash our face with the water from the waterfall, we\u2019ll stay young. In\
  \ my material world, it means they don\u2019t need cleansing milk, whitening face\
  \ mask, facial wash with AHA, sunblock and night cream. Really? O Gosh, sounds like\
  \ it\u2019s not a good place for dermatologist because she or he can\u2019t earn\
  \ lots of money there, right? \n\nFor me, I rarely go to the place just to see nature,\
  \ I prefer the city, but it doesn\u2019t mean that I can\u2019t enjoy it. To see\
  \ the waterfall, we must walk through the pines forest and a small river. Although\
  \ it\u2019s a bit scary, it was beautiful, full of fresh air! Near the waterfall,\
  \ I saw lots of monkeys, one of them stealth my sister\u2019s water and drank the\
  \ water. My cousin\u2019s friend told us that they\u2019re the holy monkeys, forbidden\
  \ to annoy them. After enjoying the fresh air, we need a horse to go back to the\
  \ main road or walking through the forest would make you feel like climbing a mountain.\
  \ \n\nNext stop was Borobudur temple. This time, my cousin\u2019s friend accompanied\
  \ us went up to the top of the temple. Local wisdom said that if we can touch the\
  \ Buddha\u2019s hand, all wishes would come true, and not all of them can touch\
  \ it. My sister asks me,\u201D Do you really want to go upstairs? You\u2019re afraid\
  \ of height, right?\u201D but I told her that I would be fine. We went upstairs\
  \ and the view from the top was incredibly awesome. You must see it by yourself.\
  \ Many people were trying to reach the Buddha\u2019s hand and I was busy thinking\
  \ about how could I reach downstairs because the stairs were too steep? Conquering\
  \ my fear wasn\u2019t as easy as people say. It took courage including the courage\
  \ to ask someone to walk right in front of me so I can hold their shoulder and then\
  \ let my sister and my cousin\u2019s friend laughed at me. It\u2019s fun! \n\nVisiting\
  \ a heritage site wasn\u2019t bad at all. Sometimes we need to know our history\
  \ deeper than just reading a book. With good knowledge of our own history, we know\
  \ what we must do and going forward with a strong vision for our future."
