Text: "It was early winter, at least that was as far my brain can remember. As a result\
  \ of midnight conversation, I slept for two hours, or less. It was 4 AM when I started\
  \ walking down the pavement of my block. Too early, especially for winter. Half-running\
  \ with a zipped up jacket. I was not in a hurry, somehow, it was an attempt to fight\
  \ the breeze with an increased walking speed. Only one came to mind, the first train,\
  \ that 5 AM one. Pretty sure, I managed to board right on time. Not much people\
  \ were there beside a couple of working men. \n\nI slept myself during that 90 minutes\
  \ ride. I was dreaming when I heard people rushed out. Half conscious, I managed\
  \ to catch up with what was going on, and it was simply the final stop. When I stepped\
  \ out of the gate, the morning freshness brought my consciousness back. It was still\
  \ pretty dark, and I decided to walk myself to Gare du Nord. Even though transferring\
  \ to that station was a stop away from where I stood, I decided to go on foot. \n\
  \nI was finishing my morning coffee, and a couple of croissants, when the RER train\
  \ left me. 20 minutes waiting for the next train was an undisputed idea, way much\
  \ better compared to the risk of burning my tongue with this freshly brewed coffee.\
  \ I stepped in the next train, it took me half an hour to Nogent-sur-Marne. Once\
  \ I arrived at the outside of the station, I took a deep breath. It was a bizarre\
  \ mixed feelings. To be honest, I was in doubt, though my curiosity finally won\
  \ the battle as took my first step of this less than a half mile walking.\n\nAnd\
  \ I was there. All alone. Stood in front of a red gate, though faded, stand out\
  \ significantly among those green surroundings. At a glance, the gate reminded me\
  \ to a scene from an old Japanese anime where a wandering samurai met his eternal\
  \ enemy. I felt like one, ready to explore the ghostly maze of the past. A statue\
  \ of a headless woman lying on her bed welcomed me. I was not sure whether it was\
  \ headless or naturally \u2018beheaded\u2019 through times. Both ways, it was such\
  \ a strange greeting. Despite the uneasy feeling, I continued to walk myself through\
  \ the silent path. A monument, similar to those I found around Cambodia was the\
  \ next in sight. Followed by a couple of pavilion that brought the scent of South\
  \ East Asia to the air. That were parts of the Indochina Pavilion, whose main building\
  \ was through phases of becoming something new.  I wandered through some abandoned\
  \ building. Unfortunately, the doors were locked, keeping those ghost away from\
  \ telling what had happened during their days.\n\nThe next path guided me to something\
  \ less familiar. It was a monument dedicated to all black soldiers who served as\
  \ the welcoming committee. The message was clear, I entered different territory,\
  \ Africa. All along the way, I was fascinated by different kinds of building said\
  \ to be the replicas of what one should find in Congo, Sudan, Madagascar and several\
  \ other countries whom I failed to remember. However, despite how magnificent those\
  \ building were, by the time I was there, the horrors were everywhere. Slightly\
  \ different to their Asian fellow, some buildings were not in good shapes. Mostly\
  \ surrounded by fences, though some left unguarded. I managed to sneak to one of\
  \ them, trying to peek through an aging door hoping to find a zombie apocalypse\
  \ sanctuary inside, disappointedly saw nothing but pitch black.\n\nI was resting\
  \ my aching left ankle when my mind wandered through times. Travelled back to the\
  \ early 20th century where the place served as a colonial exhibition. In other words,\
  \ a human zoo, long before it changed its destiny as a garden of tropical agriculture.\
  \ This uneasy feeling was still there when I decided to leave. As I stood, a song\
  \ from the late Tony Sly burst out of my headphone. Singing the final verse of that\
  \ Capo 4th fret song \u201Ci will leave for the sake of others, so they can do the\
  \ same\u201D."
