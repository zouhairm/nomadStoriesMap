Text: "It was my first time in New York City and my first travel alone. It also was,\
  \ in some way, a challenge I assumed as I was going through my 40th birthday in\
  \ this world. Recently divorced from the man I had slept with for 20 years and father\
  \ of my two children, I was empowered to face the incomparable dream of traveling\
  \ alone to the city I had known through thousands of movies.\n\nA month before my\
  \ triumphal arrival, my aunt Rosaleen suggested me to stay at Sacred Heart Residence.\
  \ It is quite similar to a hotel but manage by nuns, only for women, at the heart\
  \ of Manhattan and extremely cheap with breakfast and dinner included.  This last\
  \ point was what tilt the balance in favor of a sort of catholic institution with\
  \ little women in black habits walking around, all reminding me the youthful years\
  \ of my primary school in Buenos Aires.  The only warning they made me was that\
  \ the closing time was at 10 pm every night, and that there was no exception. The\
  \ system changed a bit on Fridays and Saturdays when closing time extended up to\
  \ 11 pm.  My aunt insisted that it was not a problem: \u201Cyou would never arrive\
  \ later than that\u201D, those were her words.\n\nI obediently fulfilled my schedule\
  \ during the first nine days. The last night I made arrangements to meet a friend\
  \ in Brooklyn. She was an intimate from Argentina, settled in Santiago de Chile\
  \ and working at that moment in New York. She was staying in a rented apartment\
  \ in Brooklyn near Greenpoint Station. We went to drink beer and eat pizza while\
  \ we spent the time talking and updating our lives in bar at Williamsburg. It was\
  \ a rainy day, I was wet from head to toe and full of packages and bags as it was\
  \ my last day in New York. Time passed so joyfully that when I decided to go back\
  \ to my nuns\u2019 home it was too late. I ran through subways connections; I ran\
  \ the streets of Manhattan just to arrive 5 minutes late. I started knocking at\
  \ the door in a crazy way, shouting to let me go in. But the doors were closed and\
  \ nobody answered. The lights that were turned on when I arrived, suddenly disappeared.\
  \ With the conviction that they were unfairly and deliberately leaving me outside\
  \ on the last night of my staying, with a rainy night unfolding and a huge city\
  \ I scarcely knew I started crying, yelling and blaming the holy heaven for that\
  \ situation. But no one came out.\n\nI was alone, sitting in the entrance stairs\
  \ of that nonsacred residence with no much money, my cloths wet and a flight to\
  \ take the following morning. My friend told me the owner of her apartment wouldn\u2019\
  t accept me sleeping there so, there was no chance of going to Brooklyn again. Suddenly,\
  \ Martin Scorsese came to my mind  as I remembered the film \u201CAfter Hours\u201D\
  \ and my worst fears appeared: street gangs, drug dealers, kidnappers. Everyone\
  \ became a threat.\n\nI walked to the nearest avenue, but it was not until de 5th\
  \ Avenue that I found a coffee shop open. I talked to the waitress and asked if\
  \ I could stay there for a while, \u201Cuntil dawn at least\u201D I said. The girl\
  \ and the manager that was behind the bar accepted with pleasure and encourage a\
  \ nice conversation among a few clients who were there on that coffee shop that\
  \ night. We talked about football teams, gastronomy, cities and about our lifes.\
  \ It was the most interesting and unthinkable night I ever spent alone in a foreign\
  \ country."
