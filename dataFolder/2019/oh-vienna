Text: "We are looking for a green unbrella, yet it's not raining. The early spring\
  \ sky is clear blue, with a brisk chill in the early morning air. The escalators\
  \ of Karlsplatz spew us out beside the Wiener Staatsoper - the world famous Vienna\
  \ Opera House. People are queuing to the side. We discover that, if you're up for\
  \ the wait, you can get standing tickets for three Euro - for less than the price\
  \ of a sandwich you can feast on Puccini or any of the operas or ballets on offer\
  \ - the programme changes each evening. (We queued for Tosca but missed out. Next\
  \ night we queued for Swan Lake and got lucky). Its jaw-dropping beauty is just\
  \ an appetiser for Vienna, which Is the most architecturally beautiful city I have\
  \ ever seen - enigmas from the age of grace, grandeur and elegance, or some may\
  \ say ostentatious opulence. We have the Habsburg dynasty to thank for that - even\
  \ if their empirical history was often colourfully dubious. \n\nOur quest for the\
  \ elusive green umbrella continues - aha! Outside the Albertina Museum (home to\
  \ many Monets and collections of other household name artists), beside the World\
  \ War 2 memorial, is the elusive green umbrella, attached to our guide. We will\
  \ follow it dutifully for the next three hours on a whistlestop tour that takes\
  \ in many of the main attractions, enables us to become orientated, while broiling\
  \ our brains with bucket loads of horrible histories, humourous anecdotes and useful\
  \ information. The public space in front of the Hofburg palace Is a breath-taking\
  \ sight that becomes chilling when you realise this is where Hitler announced the\
  \ Anschluss of Austria in 1938. The walking tour finishes in the Jewish quarter,\
  \ where we learn of the brutality that saw the Jewish population drop from 200,000\
  \ to around 12,000. Later, I hear a violin busker play the theme music from Schindler's\
  \ List. It breaks my heart. \n\nI have an interest in psychology, so we hop on the\
  \ tram for the Sigmund Freud Museum. It may not be on the mainstream city break\
  \ itinerary but it's well worth the venture. From his house in Berggasse 19, Freud\
  \ established his medical practice where he remained for the next 47 years until\
  \ he and his family had to flee from the city he loved. Here he developed his theories\
  \ and practice of psycho-analysis. . You even get to see the famous couch! \n\n\
  Every fibre of this glorious city oozes history - yet there is that difficult dichotomy\
  \ between celebration, commemoration and dealing with the past - which any divided\
  \ society with a complex past must face. Steeped in culture, art, beauty, music,\
  \ architecture and all aspects that elevate and celebrate our humanity, I feel elevated,\
  \ as if my soul soars. I am enraptured, body and mind. \n\nMany myths abound about\
  \ Mozart and his colourful life here, and where he may or may not have lived. He\
  \ was a bad tenant, he moved around - sex, drugs and rock 'n' roll 18th century\
  \ style. The Mozart cafe is worth a visit - in fact,  we are on a special mission\
  \ - undertaking our own personal Chocolate Cake Tour - searching for the ultimate\
  \  sachertorte! The two most famous outlets are Cafe Sacher and Cafe Demel, who\
  \ even went to court over the issue! They often have queues as does Cafe Central,\
  \ where Trotsky, Stalin, Freud and others hung out.  Our personal favourite was\
  \ at the stunningly beautiful Belvedere Museum. Although famous for its Klimt collection,\
  \ the stately home is a masterpiece initself, as is the Habsburgs summer residence\
  \ Schonbrunn. \n\nBy coincidence, we notice our favourite band from the place we\
  \ call home is playing at the Gasometer - an entertainment complex composed from\
  \ four old, derelict gas tanks re-modelled and rejuvenated. Snow Patrol, the Northern\
  \ Ireland masters of melody, guitar riffs and lyrical genius have a gig here - well,\
  \ it would be rude not to get tickets! And of course, they open with Take Back the\
  \ City.  Oh what a night! But the song that stays in my head, the ear worm for five\
  \ days was of course, that eighties classic based on Graham Greene's novel The Third\
  \ Man - Midge Ure's Masterpiece, Vienna. I take back this city, in my heart."
