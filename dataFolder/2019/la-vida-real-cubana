Text: "Stepping into Havana, Cuba was like taking a step back in time, as if the clock\
  \ simply stopped moving in 1959 and never got a new set of batteries. Our twenty-five\
  \ minute plane ride from Miami had dropped us off not only in a foreign country,\
  \ but also in a foreign century. Remnants of an earlier lifestyle could be seen\
  \ on every street corner: colorful T-birds zoomed through the streets, surrounded\
  \ by dilapidated buildings filled with crying children and signs proclaiming \u201C\
  Viva la Revolucion\u201D (\u201CLong Live the Revolution\u201D). Tension hung in\
  \ the air like a dense fog: tension between the past and the present, and between\
  \ the present and an unknown future. There were no smartphones. No wifi. No McDonald\u2019\
  s or Starbucks or Mariott hotels. Just an island that had spent the last fifty years\
  \ cut off from the majority of the Western world. And there it remained, even in\
  \ 2016, when I arrived in the city accompanied by my dear Cuban friend and mentor,\
  \ Magally. \n\nI met Magally when I was 16 years old. Originally from Camaguey,\
  \ Magally fled Cuba for the States in 1975 and had not returned since age 21. Her\
  \ story couldn\u2019t have been more different than mine, but our lives suddenly\
  \ intersected in 2008, when my dad enlisted her to help me prepare for the AP Spanish\
  \ exam. The first time I visited Magally\u2019s home, she opened the front door\
  \ and immediately pulled me into a tight embrace, rambling off in rapid Spanish.\
  \ \u201CWhy\u2019d you ring the doorbell? Why didn\u2019t you just walk in?\u201D\
  \ she asked me as she pulled me into her house. Two hours later, I was sitting at\
  \ her kitchen table listening to her tell fantastical stories of her childhood and\
  \ sipping on \"sopa de malanga\" that she had piled into my bowl.  \n\nThe AP exam\
  \ came and went, but, years later, our friendship remained. \n\nNow, I had the privilege\
  \ to accompany her on her first trip back to her homeland since the mid 1970s. I\u2019\
  m not sure what I expected. I thought I would see some tears in her eyes or hear\
  \ heartbreaking stories about her life. I thought that, as we walked through the\
  \ familiar streets, she would share bittersweet memories of growing up on this island,\
  \ an island that was still balancing precariously on a ledge between what has been\
  \ and what could be.\n\nInstead, I heard only the sounds of her infectious laughter\
  \ and contagious joy. I met lively friends who had been near and dear to her and\
  \ watched her dance wildly to street music with a huge smile on her face. She showed\
  \ me the way through Havana in the same way she had showed me around her house,\
  \ describing each and every corner with flagrant pride.\n\nOne day, as we rounded\
  \ the corner from one of winding streets in Old Havana, she grabbed my arm excitedly\
  \ and exclaimed, \u201CWe must walk along the Malecon,\u201D she told me. \u201C\
  It's very famous here in Cuba.\u201D \n\u201CGreat! Can we swim?\u201D The intense\
  \ heat and humidity had me losing gallons of water through sweat every day. An ocean\
  \ dip sounded delightful.\n\u201CNo! Absolutely not,\u201D she warned. \u201CThe\
  \ water is full of oil from the bay.\u201D \nYet, as we neared the seawall, I observed\
  \ countless kids and teens doing cannonballs off the rocks and into the ocean beneath.\
  \ \nI pointed to them, \u201CBut there are a ton of people swimming!\u201D \n\"\
  Yeah, because they are Cuban,\u201D she said, as if I were a child to whom she need\
  \ to explain something important. \u201CWe are crazy.\" Then she threw her head\
  \ back and did a full belly laugh. \n\nAfter all these years, Magally\u2019s identity\
  \ never faltered. As I walked along with her, the story of this little island unfolded\
  \ before me: its story is one of suffering, of hope, and of the remarkable resilience\
  \ of the human spirit and the Cuban people. In a world full of fear of all that\
  \ is \u201Cother,\u201D the story of Cuba is one that we should all explore, and\
  \ hopefully come out on the other side with a greater wisdom of our own history\
  \ and a deeper compassion for the world around us."
