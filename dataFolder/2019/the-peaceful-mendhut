Text: "The Peaceful Mendhut\nEvery piece of Earth is gorgeous. It calls the people\
  \ soul to come and feel it. The region where I was born has so many beautiful places\
  \ to visit. Indonesia is the largest archipelago country in the world, with thousand\
  \ of Islands. It also consists of hundreds native ethnic and linguistic groups,\
  \ from Sabang to Merauke. The pluralism is influenced by local and foreign culture.\
  \ Then it leaves the history about local kingdom and colonialism. And it\u2019s\
  \ so amazing to discover around. \nMy story begins here, with my friend. I decide\
  \ Java as the cultured region to discover. Riding a bike in the morning starts my\
  \ journey. I don\u2019t know what to visit first, just enjoying the road and fell\
  \ the atmosphere of the traffic. As the wheel running, I stop at the single beautiful\
  \ temple there. I park the bike and walking and trying to get there. This place\
  \ is not like the usual tourist places. It\u2019s not such a large temple, nor really\
  \ popular among the tourists.\nWe step up to the Temple. It\u2019s named Mendhut\
  \ temple. It\u2019s the ninth century Buddhist temple which is located in Magelang,\
  \ Central Java. It's built by King Indra in the dynasty of Syailendra. We are walking\
  \ around to view the reliefs. In the centre of the temple, there\u2019s a single\
  \ large room with three big Buddha statues. They are Vairocana, Avalokitesvara,\
  \ and Vajrapawi. The relief of the Mendhut temple is named Jayaka fable which is\
  \ narrating the animal story of Buddhist teaching. It\u2019s told how Buddha loving\
  \ and caring about their livings.\nAs I walk around the temple, I was curious. It\
  \ just appears on my thought, wondering about how the temple stood alone. Because\
  \ some temples I\u2019ve visited before are like a kingdom area with many temples.\
  \ That\u2019s big and large and it usually has a point. I kill my curiosity and\
  \ find out what happened a long time ago. I tried to seek out from the internet\
  \ and ask some locals. Thus, if you view the temple from above, you will see the\
  \ suspiring fact. There are three temples were located on a straight line, they\
  \ are Pawon, Mendhut, and Borobudur. That Mendhut temple is in the middle of two\
  \ those temples, Borobudur and Pawon temple. It\u2019s spread out from the north\
  \ to the south. It\u2019s suggesting there was a symbolic meaning that binds these\
  \ temples.\nOne thing makes this temple special is that it has a huge statue of\
  \ Buddha inside rather than those two temples. In fact, Borobudur and Pawon are\
  \ bigger temples. That\u2019s why a Buddhist ritual mostly starts from the Mendhut\
  \ temple. During the Vesak, there will be a ritual of Buddha prayer around the temple.\
  \ It\u2019s held among the local Javanese. Thousands of people will gather to verbalize\
  \ some mantras to celebrate that holy day. They belief praying there can full their\
  \ wishes.  It will continue with a chanting parade marching towards Pawon and Borobudur\
  \ temples.\nThere is a big banyan tree close to the temple. It has many vines. Sometimes,\
  \ I see some kids playing there, swinging through the tree. There\u2019s also a\
  \ group of sunflower growing nicely. It\u2019s so relaxing. If you visited this\
  \ temple in the afternoon, you will get to know that this temple is face to the\
  \ sunset. However, it\u2019s nice about checking out the sunrise in the back of\
  \ Mendhut. The tourists are mostly being fond of to captures with their family in\
  \ the backdrop of meaningful Mendhut. It\u2019s such a nice place to calm your mind\
  \ in a moment.\nIf you visit this place, you will see the Buddhist Monastery ahead\
  \ of this temple. It has a beautiful park and a lotus pond. It feels so peaceful.\
  \ The tourist is allowed to come inside and see the meditation providing you don\u2019\
  t make any noise. There will be meditation every day. You may join and experience\
  \ it.\nPersonally, travelling is not only about finding a fancy building or a big\
  \ modern city. It\u2019s about how we learn every single thing and make us realized\
  \ how beautiful the world is. It will also teach you to be smarter and more grateful\
  \ to God and its creature."
