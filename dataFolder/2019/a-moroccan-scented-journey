Text: "\u201D Morocco \u2013 The country that travels within you\u201D\nWaking up\
  \ in the middle of the night due to a singing prayer, men yelling\u201Dtaxi\u201D\
  \ after a camel, women literally begging you to paint henna on your arm, Berber\
  \ colours wore by the majority of men perfectly blending with the sober tones on\
  \ women clothing, the alluring smell of shawarma in every corner (later to discover\
  \ that the scent actually came from all the spices which are being sold in their\
  \ markets) \u2026do all this things seem uncanny to you? It sure did to me, the\
  \ first time I bumped into this totally new and unknown culture. However, one week\
  \ later, I have completely fallen in love with the country, the people, the traditions\
  \ and the one thing that they promote the most (of course, putting aside their magnificent\
  \ argan oil): TOLERANCE.\n\nI visited five fascinating Moroccan cities last October:\
  \ Fes, Marrakesh, Essaouira, Casablanca and Rabat.  It was the first time I travelled\
  \ somewhere by plane and needless to say, the first time I saw another continent.\
  \ All these uncommon events led to what people like to name cultural shock. Being\
  \ a country of different religion, other than the one I was a accustomed with, Morocco\
  \ set some pretty radical rules that I, as a tourist, wasn\u2019t sure I had to\
  \ follow (in the end, nothing atrocious happened, I was allowed to wear my summery\
  \ outfits mostly based on short skirts and jeans and actually got to hear from a\
  \ local dude selling souvenirs \u201Cnice legs, girl\u201D. See \u2026 Tolerance).\n\
  \nMarrakesh has to be the one that impressed me the most. I still dream about those\
  \ beautiful mosaic patterns covering most walls of Medina (old town), the aromatic\
  \ spices, the maroon desert where I first drove an ATV (being a born adventurer,\
  \ I almost overturned due to high speed and a cactus that appeared out of nowhere)\
  \ and meeting someone who quickly became a confident friend: a camel which I named\
  \ Chanel. My dearest memory of the people in Morocco has to do, in fact, with the\
  \ camels\u2019 caretaker/tamer. We were enjoying our group camel ride while the\
  \ joyful man carved us souvenirs made of dried palm leaves (mandatory to mention\
  \ he was doing that while singing a Drake song to us). Best place to visit in Marrakesh\
  \ in my opinion? Definitely the luxurious Majorelle Garden, an elegant place brought\
  \ to life by Jacques Majorelle, a French Orientalist artist. In the 1980s, the property\
  \ was purchased by two fashion designers, the one and only Yves Saint-Laurent and\
  \ Pierre Berg\xE9 who worked to restore it.  Since you are there, make sure to book\
  \ a ride with the camels and ATVs, it is truly diverting and memorable (watch out\
  \ for cactuses though).\n\nEssaouira is a dreamy location many tourists tend to\
  \ ignore when it comes to visiting Morocco, since the most searched for places are\
  \ usually Casablanca, Fes or Rabat. However, this windy west coast city represents\
  \ the contact between the sacred lands of Medina and the frosty waves of Atlantic\
  \ Ocean, having a much more laid back vibe than the other cities in the country.\
  \ What I relished about this location? Its historical heritage which takes us back\
  \ thousands of years ago (it was inhabited by the Carthaginians in the 5th century\
  \ BC), its devotion to street music, the fact that it represents home for the goats\
  \ living in trees (yes, it is true; goats are actually climbing argan trees in search\
  \ of fruits).  Nevertheless, the tremendous draw about Essaouira is it being featured\
  \ in the hit TV-show Game of Thrones (the port was used prominently in the series,\
  \ serving as background for Daenerys Targaryen purchasing the army of 8000 unsullied\
  \ soldiers). \n\nAll in all, visiting this exotic, hallowed country should really\
  \ be on your vacation bucket list. Whether you are a cinephile who fell in love\
  \ with Michael Curtiz\u2019s Casablanca or GOT\u2019s Khaleesi, a born adventurer\
  \ attracted to the desert\u2019s desolation or maybe a serene person allured by\
  \ a cup of Mint Tea, Morocco is the best place for you to discover the land whose\
  \ natives use the terminology\u201Dwusakh d-dunya\u201D for money (which roughly\
  \ translates to\u201Ddirt of the world\u201D)."
