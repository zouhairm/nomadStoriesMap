Text: "Sharing how interesting of Tomar, Portugal. I have 3 places that I adored about\
  \ their hidden symbols, They are: Synagogue, The Knight Templar and Igreja de Santa\
  \ Maria dos Olivais.\nLet us go to synagogue. Honestly, it was the first time I\
  \ visited synagogue. it is a simple meeting room. The synagogue has 4 columns, they\
  \ represent 4 matriarchs and corbels are for 12 tribes of Israel. I was wondering\
  \ why the synagogue has a very good acoustic. Then I looked in details, I found\
  \ every corner has 1 hole, it seemed that they are made from small barrel of clay.\
  \ So, I asked the guardian what the function of the holes, she said that in that\
  \ era, the leader of Jewish would invite his community to have a meeting by make\
  \ a loud voice as invitation from those hole. Amazing technique!\nOur next point\
  \ was Convent of Christ - Knight Templar. I was very impressed about the 2 pillars\
  \ aside the window of Tomar. In my perception, they seem, that they want to tell\
  \ something about its history. So, right hand side pillar has a sculpture about\
  \ warrior, belt and octopus\u2019 tentacles. And at the left hand side pillar has\
  \ a sculpture about angel, chain, and cut octopus\u2019 tentacles. They seem to\
  \ say that the right hand side pillar was the era when the warrior had authority,\
  \ they squeeze all human aspects by the \u2018belt\u2019, they were in frighten\
  \ by octopus\u2019 tentacles. But after that, there\u2019s a process for changing\
  \ of point of view from the authority, it was represented by the big window. Around\
  \ the window, we can see some tree of life\u2019s sculptures. Left hand side pillar\
  \ represents when the Christian came to Tomar. Warriors changed into the angels\
  \ sculpture, warrior\u2019s belt changed into the chain, and octopus does not have\
  \ tentacles anymore. Seemed that it was the peace era of Tomar.\nAfter those journey\
  \ then I went to Igreja de Santa Maria dos OlivaiIs. From the outside appearance,\
  \ this church is very simple. But when I stepped in, I found so many hidden symbols.\
  \ Especially when there was no light from the lamp. I gave attention to so many\
  \ illuminations from the light. One of them is come from the star glass windows\
  \ above the altar. I realized when I looked back to the main gate, I saw triangle\
  \ shadow, their light made from illumination when the light hit 2 blocks of emboss\u2019\
  \ stone above the gate. It looks like support the rose glass window. By the way\
  \ you can count 8 steps in the staircase. I thought it\u2019s an important number\
  \ relates to the Knight Templar.\nAfter I was enjoying those historical buildings,\
  \ the next journey I was starting to find something delicious for my tongue. \U0001F60A\
  \ My first destination was the medieval restaurant, is near from PRA\xC7A DA REPUBLICA,\
  \ its name \u2018Taverna Antiova\u2019. First impression when I walked in to the\
  \ restaurant, I felt in the medieval era, the twilight room, unique chandeliers,\
  \ the wooden desks and chairs from the tree trunk. Ok, I\u2019ll tell you about\
  \ the meals..for the the main course I ordered roasted duck and asparagus. It was\
  \ big portion for me, the tasteful duck roasted, the skin duck was crunchy but the\
  \ meat was very tender. By the way, you have to see the toilet..it\u2019s really\
  \ cute and interesting.. they have toilet tools as you were in medieval era, from\
  \ the wooden door, roof, bucket, washbowl and the wooden closet also. \U0001F60A\
  \nThe next day I tried to go to pastry cake shop, the next door from Taverna Antiova.\
  \ Its name is A Rosa caf\xE9 dos artistas. They sell a lot of yummy cakes.  But\
  \ first of all you have to try their \u2018Portuguese egg tart\u2019, it\u2019s\
  \ an addictive cake..it was the most delicious Portuguese egg tart that I\u2019\
  ve ever tried before. The tart is very crunchy and it fills with soft egg in the\
  \ middle of the cake. \nSo, they are my stories about Tomar, I wish I will have\
  \ another trip to another city in Portugal. I was enjoying to explore Portugal.\
  \ I can find nice and friendly people, which was make me like in my home country.\
  \ \U0001F60A Miss you Portugal!"
