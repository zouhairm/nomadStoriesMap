Text: "I studied abroad in the Spring of 2016. As a young college sophomore, I had\
  \ no idea how in over my head I was. There I was thinking I could live so far away\
  \ from my family for a whole semester. It was only January and already I had fallen\
  \ into a deep depression. I wasn't enjoying my time like everyone else. I would\
  \ sob on the phone with my aunt almost every night. Eventually, she had enough.\
  \ She took a flight from NYC to Spain and decided to spend Valentine's weekend with\
  \ me. I was studying in Seville at the time, a place she hadn't been since the expo\
  \ in the '90s, and we relived her memories. We spent time in the Plaza de Espa\xF1\
  a where we rowed some boats and took great pictures. It was amazing! She even got\
  \ us a weekend trip to Cordoba and Granada. I had a blast and although that semester\
  \ was hard (I went back home for a week for Easter because I had fallen into a deep\
  \ depression again) it gave me the courage and love I needed to survive. I was even\
  \ crazy enough to go back the following year! That time I wasn't so homesick. That\
  \ time I knew how to really stand on my own two feet. I even think I caught a travel\
  \ bug if I'm being honest. I fell in love with travel and It was all thanks to her\
  \ visiting me that one time and telling me it was all going to be ok. I was going\
  \ to be ok. I was going to survive it and come out stronger on the other side."
