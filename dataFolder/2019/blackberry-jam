Text: "\u201CDo you mind accompanying Ellis on his Edinburgh Canal Boat trip today?\u201D\
  \ The head of staff at the halfway house asks me over morning tea. \u201CSure!\u201D\
  \ I say, feigning confidence. I\u2019ve been in the country for less than a week,\
  \ and it\u2019s my first official day on the job. Slightly bewildered, I leave the\
  \ house accompanied by twenty-one-year-old Ellis, with his multiple piercings and\
  \ mop of red hair. I hoist my day bag onto my shoulder with nonchalance, as if the\
  \ idea of accompanying a person I didn\u2019t know, to a city I was unfamiliar with,\
  \ on a journey I knew next-to-nothing about, was no big deal.\n\tEllis, born on\
  \ the Isle of Lewis off the northern coast of Scotland, is one of the residents\
  \ at the halfway house outside Edinburgh where I\u2019m working as a peer mentor.\
  \ The place supports people from a varied background of extremely difficult circumstances.\
  \ Ellis is no exception: he\u2019s lost his home. Taking part in community activities\
  \ is a major goal for the residents of the house, and volunteers both old and new\
  \ are there to encourage and assist in this endeavor. It was jumping in the deep\
  \ end for both Ellis and myself. He didn\u2019t even know my name before that morning.\
  \ \n\tWe board alongside an assortment of Edinbronians. The boat rocks ever so slightly\
  \ as it glides down the muddy waters of the Edinburgh Canal, the fairy lights strung\
  \ up over the galley windows clinking lightly on the glass with each sway and swing\
  \ of the hull. The smell of coffee and the sharp tang of freshly cut flowers fill\
  \ the interior of the boat. It seems we will be plant collecting on today\u2019\
  s journey. The boat\u2019s guide is telling us about plant and herb lore of the\
  \ area and different foraging techniques. Ellis paces across the galley, groaning\
  \ and intermittently cursing. I look around at the other people on the boat uncomfortably.\
  \ Ellis turns and states angrily \u201Cthis is boring!\u201D Anxious about our companions\u2019\
  \ stares, I ask him to be patient. Ellis fidgets, scratching absently at the fresh\
  \ tattoo of a leopard on his bicep. It\u2019s one of many, including a blurred and\
  \ very large ELLIS across the entirety of his forearm. I ask him why he got it,\
  \ and his deadpan response is \u201Cin case I forget.\u201D I can\u2019t tell if\
  \ he\u2019s joking or not. We dock, and the captain ties up the boat, the lot of\
  \ us teetering off onto a rickety, water-eaten platform. We march off down a path\
  \ bordering the canal, the guide announcing when we come across rose hips and hawthorn,\
  \ meadow sweet and nettle. Ellis walks beside me, silent for a time except for the\
  \ occasional kick of a stone, or the tearing of leaves that he grabs handfuls of\
  \ as we walk past. He\u2019s bored, he states again, adding gruffly that it\u2019\
  s \u201Cnot his cup of tea\u201D. I\u2019m not sure what to say in return. In lieu\
  \ of a response I murmur something noncommittal and try to keep up with his odd\
  \ skipping walk. \n\tWhen we return to the boat, the guide tells us we\u2019re to\
  \ use our foraged goods to make lunch. Ellis brightens up immediately. He turns\
  \ to me, smiling. He says he loves to cook. I nod enthusiastically and say I do\
  \ as well. I ask him what he likes about it. He doesn\u2019t look up, instead speaking\
  \ to his gathered blackberries. \u201CSometimes, cooking helps me feel calm\u201D\
  . And I agree. I feel tears prick my eyes. A vivid memory of eating homemade jam\
  \ on toast at my home in New England, in the yellow kitchen of my mother\u2019s\
  \ flat. Here I was, heartsick and nervous, far from the place I called home, with\
  \ a boy who didn\u2019t have one. His concept of \u201Chome\u201D wasn\u2019t positive.\
  \ No sunny kitchen, no people to miss. Yet here we both were, through some odd series\
  \ of events, together on the Edinburgh canal. Two little boats on our own currents\
  \ of life who happen to converge at this singular point in time. I help him pour\
  \ the jam we make into pots in companionable, comfortable silence. We grin. The\
  \ boat sails on."
