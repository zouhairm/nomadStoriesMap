Text: "For many, going alone is scary. For me, it is in these unpredictable moments\
  \ of solo travel, that we are often gifted with memories and friendships that last\
  \ a life time. \n\nAs my timetable emptied last week, I found myself with the opportunity\
  \ to head out alone for the first time since arriving in Thailand three weeks ago.\
  \ \u2018Puttha Monthon\u2019, a park devoted to Buddha, was my destination of choice.\
  \ On a hot Tuesday afternoon, I strolled along a busy main road for 5km, until I\
  \ eventually arrived in the huge, barren green-space, which stretched for miles\
  \ around it\u2019s central statue- a 52ft tall, intimidating golden statue of Buddha.\
  \ The park was much larger than I expected. Quiet and empty. Not a tourist in sight!\
  \ Nevertheless, Buddha\u2019s calming gaze watched over me as I pondered  over where\
  \ to start my exploration in the near thousand-acre plot.\n\nIn the distance I could\
  \ hear groups of young monks being taught throughout the park. I\u2019d find myself\
  \ walking towards them before becoming tentative, and retreating in fear of getting\
  \ caught up in any monk-style commotion! Feeling lost and wishing I had some company,\
  \ my gaze returned to the irresistible central statue. I quickly decided it would\
  \ be the best place for me to begin. Walking up to the white, marble base of the\
  \ piece, I slipped off my sandals to obey Buddhist ritual of removing foot-wear\
  \ in places of worship (and often in shops and restaurants here too).  Despite slightly\
  \ burning the sole's of my dirty feet, I persisted and skipped barefooted up the\
  \ hot stairs. Eventually, I made it to the top where the large, ethereal shrine\
  \ stood before me. \n\nI witnessed silence. A Thai couple, placing flowers on the\
  \ marble, and behind them, a local woman with incense in her hands, praying. Quickly\
  \ she noticed me and yelled 'put your shoes back on, it's boiling!'. She smiled\
  \ and I laughed, feeling embarrassed that my actions saw me burning my feet in fear\
  \ of offending Buddhist etiquette. After returning the sandals to my feet, I stood\
  \ back and closed my eyes,  breathing in the peaceful moment. I went on to kneel\
  \ on the prayer mat. Sitting silently, the local woman soon introduced herself to\
  \ me.\n\nQuickly I learnt that she was 32 and from Bangkok. Regularly she attends\
  \ the park to worship, as well as to feed the birds, and the fish wish inhabit many\
  \ lakes the grounds has to offer. She was bright and friendly and insisted on showing\
  \ me around. Returning to our feet, we continued chatting and went on to spend the\
  \ afternoon together exploring the park, feeding the birds, and analysing the temples\
  \ and Pagodas. We shared food together and rested in the park. We face-timed her\
  \ English boyfriend from his office in Bangkok- quite a funny encounter! At the\
  \ end of the day she flagged down a taxi for me and described my destination, in\
  \ Thai, to the driver which was very much appreciated considering the language barrier\
  \ between myself and them which has so often lead to confusion. She was kind, open,\
  \ friendly, and funny- some of my favourite qualities in people.\n\nIt seems that\
  \ when we conjure up the courage to explore by ourselves, magic moments can occur.\
  \ No longer hidden in a pack of fellow travellers, we allow ourselves to be vulnerable\
  \ and to be seen by outsiders for the first time, as well as seeing outsiders as\
  \ individuals too. Instead of facing inwards towards the familiar, our world view\
  \ opens, and we become engaged with people and experiences that otherwise would've\
  \ passed us by. Going alone is unpredictable and not always easy. But days like\
  \ this, at the Buddhist Park, remind me of the beauty of stepping out of our comfort\
  \ zones and not relying on others to go about our daily business. With a brave leap\
  \ into the unknown, an open heart and a smile, the familiar is replaced with the\
  \ strange and the boring, with the exciting. It is such beautiful, yet fleeting\
  \ friendships experienced on-the-road that always leave me yearning for more. Seemingly\
  \ small and insignificant, these significantly life-changing connections are for\
  \ me, what travelling and life, is all about..."
