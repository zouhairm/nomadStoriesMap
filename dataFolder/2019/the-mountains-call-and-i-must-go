Text: "Swiss roots run deeply in my family to the point where traditions and pride\
  \ are its foundation. It defines us. It makes us who we are. So, to say that a pilgrimage\
  \ to the home country was needed in my own life, was an understatement. By pure\
  \ luck (think of a Harry Potter 'liquid luck' moment) I boarded a plane with husband\
  \ in tow and jet setted to a place I already called home. Getting there can only\
  \ be described as a horror story, but I choose to block that out, after all, the\
  \ vacation itself is what is important, right? \nIn any case, we landed, a little\
  \ rough around the edges, but alive and took the prompt train headed for the carless\
  \ Alpen village of Wengen. The Lauterbrunen Valley which it sits atop of is monumentally\
  \ beautiful with dreamy waterfalls, chalets dotting the green expanse, and above,\
  \ the towering Jungfraujoch peak that boasts to be the highest mountain in Europe\
  \ (insider note: visit the hotel Alpen Rose for local knowledge on when is the best\
  \ time to see the top of the mountain). \nAfter a hellish journey we rested in the\
  \ peaceful town, walking up its scenic hills, stopping to take in the pastoral surroundings\
  \ filled with the tinkling of cow bells and the bleat of goats, and picked up chocolate\
  \ at the local Co-op. \nThereafter, we felt more adventurous and hoped on the train\
  \ (as is the only way to travel in Switzerland) to the main hub of Interlaken, situated\
  \ securely at the base of the mountain. My surprise came at not the bustling city,\
  \ main transportation system and boat tours out to Lake Thun, but at the overshadow\
  \ of Asian influence. I found Interlaken beautiful in it's own right, but by far\
  \ the sweetest sound to my heart came with our trip onto the lake. \nIt's remarkable\
  \ really, the perfect blend of greenery and blue contrast of water and mountain\
  \ that I found there. As we traversed the waters to Beatenburg, and hiked up to\
  \ the caves there, I can say in all honesty that I felt I'd died and gone to Heaven.\
  \ \nThe caves, on the other hand, were intricate works of rock and waterfalls known\
  \ for a hard won legend of a demonic dragon and a hermit saint (who saved the town\
  \ by casting the beast into the lake below). The history, rich and well alive in\
  \ it's own right, reminded me of growing up, learning my own history and the tales\
  \ that lived in me.\nIt's difficult to express all the emotions one can experience\
  \ in travel, but I always enjoy the cheesy word of 'magical'. The word however,\
  \ encompasses my exact feelings, and this I would tell anyone with a smile and exuberance\
  \ that comes with being a wanderlust. I will tell you this, that Switzerland, even\
  \ if it isn't your homeland and history, takes anyone's breath away not only with\
  \ its culture and delicious chocolate, but from its landscape that inspired Tolkien's\
  \ Middle Earth. And why not take it from Tolkien himself and take your own quest\
  \ to find a unique adventure."
