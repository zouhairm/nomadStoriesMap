Text: "\u201CDon\u2019t go there!\u201D I heard from some people. Well, I thought,\
  \ now it's too late, since I was queuing for the border crossing.\nWhile waiting,\
  \ I was invaded by a sweet memory from the past: during my semester at the University\
  \ I heard for the first time about the destination of that day: \u201CIt is place\
  \ that does not exist\u201D, said the Professor, referring to the lack of international\
  \ recognition of Northern Cyprus. At that time, I could not imagine that in a few\
  \ years ahead, I would be going there. I smiled, of excitement, of curiosity, of\
  \ tension.\n\u201CNext\u201D! It was finally my turn. At the crossing point, the\
  \ border policeman loudly said: \u201COoooh, Brazil!\u201D with the excitement of\
  \ someone who doesn\u2019t see such passport very often. Yes, I replied with a discrete\
  \ smile. After passport verification, I was allowed to enter the \u201Cbuffer zone\u201D\
  , a neutral area made to separate two communities or according to some, two countries*.\n\
  While slowly walking, I was carefully observing all the details: indications in\
  \ Greek, Turkish and English, some locals, few tourists, UN blue helmets and street\
  \ cats, all together in a narrow path. On In the walls, a clear sign of disapproval\
  \ of the status quo: \u201COne Cyprus\u201D. Not far, another demand \u201CDemilitarized\
  \ Reunited Cyprus\u201D. I was staring at the graffiti, as someone looking to a\
  \ masterpiece. When my curious eyes encountered the not so friendly eyes of a police\
  \ man, I felt that it was the appropriate time to continue my journey under a burning\
  \ sun. A Few steps later, I encountered another crossing point.  \n\u201CPlease\
  \ remove your sunglasses\u201D, I heard from the Police man. Yes, I replied while\
  \ quickly giving my blue passport. He looked at document, looked at me, looked at\
  \ the document again and with a simple gesture, I understood that I was allowed\
  \ to go forward.\nAfter two crossing points, I was in another \u201Cterritory\u201D\
  \ but weirdly enough, still in the same town. I was in Nicosia, the last divided\
  \ city in Europe.\nProgressively leaving the border behind, things around immediately\
  \ changed: the names, the language, the currency. From Panagiotis to Mustafa, from\
  \ Greek to Turkish, from Euro to Turkish Lira. The current panorama is the division,\
  \ but it was not always like that. The future, no one knows.\nI kept walking until\
  \ I found a bus to take me further north to another town, known as Famagusta. To\
  \ me, adventure between myself and the unknown. To people around me, most probably\
  \ nothing more than a regular day. Looking thought the window, I was observing the\
  \ landscape of green valleys surrounded by rocky mountains with the excitement of\
  \ seeing a place for the first time.\nIn less than two hours, I arrived. Was warmly\
  \ welcomed by my host, a charismatic Uzbek girl. While the sun was disappearing\
  \ in the horizon, we were walking to meet her friends. In the group, I was the \u201C\
  guest\u201D, perhaps the \u201Cintruder\u201D of the evening. Our table looked like\
  \ more as UN meeting without G20: Tajikistan, Ghana, Pakistan, Angola, Morocco,\
  \ Sudan, Mauritius, to mention a few. From several questions, one in particular\
  \ called my attention: \u201CSo, how is the other side?\u201D\nI couldn\u2019t hide\
  \ my surprise. I replied: \u201Cwhat do you mean?\"\n\"Is it beautiful? Is it different\
  \ from here? Which one do you prefer?\"\nI was confused but quickly realized something\
  \ odd: I was allowed to cross a border that was not open to everyone. I felt sad\
  \ and embarrassed. I felt a mix of emotions and explained: well, is a different\
  \ from here but  it\u2019s also beautiful. After a long breath, a thought came to\
  \ my mind which I decided kept private \u201Cthe entire island is gorgeous, but\
  \ not perfect, like us, human beings\u201D. \n\u201CHow is the other side?\u201D\
  \ symbolizes the contradiction between the wish to discover and the possibility\
  \ to do so. Some of us, experience the border even before it arrives: \u201CI can\
  \ not go there\u201D, I heard it several times.\nBefore leaving, I wrote a message\
  \ to my Professor telling her that sadly, even the \u201Cplace that does not exist\u201D\
  \ has borders.\n* Country is open to debate, due to the question of international\
  \ recognition."
