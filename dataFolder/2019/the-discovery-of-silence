Text: "I spent a hear of my life in Thailand hosted by a voluntary family. \nDo you\
  \ know something about buddhism? I didn't and even now I don't know a lot more than\
  \ before, but traditional definitions or explanations don't count to me. \n6 am.\n\
  The sun was raising and I wasn't ready to wake me up. I remember that a cock was\
  \ singing and the dogs finally stopped barking. I have always had huge problems\
  \ in waking me up early, but at that time I was just entered inside my new family\
  \ so I wanted to give a good impression of me (that obviously I didn't give because\
  \ I set seven alarm cloks and I let them ring without caring at all, until my host\
  \ father's voice screamed my name - pronounced in a wrong way).\nI standed up as\
  \ fast as light and I ran in the restroom to have my daily shower which consisted\
  \ of throwing buckets of cold water on me.\nThe hotness was stuffy but I couldn't\
  \ wear shorts or tank tops because inside a temple everyone must have shoulders\
  \ and knees covered, so resigned to that idea I had my breakfast, based on rice\
  \ and spicy eggs, with a fan in front of my face. \nThe passage to an intense cold\
  \ was istantaneous: inside the car I was freezing but my thoughts were far away\
  \ from my body, they were traveling to nowhere, such as the car which from the city\
  \ was going to a deserted countryside area. \nI was only with my host father and\
  \ a lot of bags full of food when I entered the temple where I could listen just\
  \ the sound of silence. It usually creates embarrassment but in that moment it was\
  \ surely holy. \nWe sat down on a stone surrounded by nature and he told me not\
  \ to move, not to think, just meditate. I was wondering: how could I stop my brain?\
  \  \nSometimes some birds sang creating a perfect armony with the background sound\
  \ of a stream. I loved it for while but he stayed  motionless for more than one\
  \ hour and I was becoming crazy: it was too much hot, the right position was impossible\
  \ to find, I was bored and frustrated. Then finally arrived the time to offer food\
  \ to the monks: I was really nervous because women can't touch them, so I had to\
  \ be really careful. If I had touched them I would have been \"impure\"... I don't\
  \ know what it really means but better not to joke with superstitious people. \n\
  During the ceremony the silance had been suddenly broken: monks started praying.\
  \ \nNobody can imagine the sound of their prayers. I think everyone must listen\
  \ to it once in his/her life. I thought they were the voices of my soul. Even if\
  \ I couldn't understand anything, they spoke to me, they whispered secrets, they\
  \ brought me into an unreal world where peace reigns . \nI couldn't define these\
  \ prayers: they could be\_ sounds, music, songs, moaning, hymns, gibberish. They\
  \ could be everything, the only certainty is that they shut my mind up. My brain\
  \ was peaceful for the first time in my life. I didn't care about the hotness, the\
  \ sweater on my forehead, the uncomfortable position (sitting with cross legs for\
  \ a long time is not so easy), the hunger, the thirst, the slumber: nothing matters\
  \ anymore. \nI felt free from my emotions that affect my behavior and free from\
  \ my imagination which gets uglier the reality. \nNo thoughts were running on my\
  \ mind, no confusion, just nothing. \nThat vacuum made me feel high. \nI am still\
  \ surprised: I discovered what silence is thanks to sounds."
