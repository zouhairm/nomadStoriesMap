Text: "It was a dream ! not a trip .. \nDecember 25th , 2018 it was so cold , the\
  \ weather was rainy ,and the sky was full of clouds \u2026\nI arrived at 3 am when\
  \ the sky was obviously dark outside , but the view from the plane was just awesome\
  \ , beautiful lights shined ,bridges were so attractive and incredible ; and in\
  \ spite of night\u2019s darkness ,everything was colored and alive \u2026 here is\
  \ Istanbul-turkey.\nI started my adventure by  visiting  the museum of \u2018\u2019\
  topkapi sarayi\u2019\u2019 , topkapi palace was the residence of ottman sultans\
  \ , where we also find the royal treasure , the holy relics of the prophet muhammed\
  \ and the imperial archives which are preserved there .\nMillions of people came\
  \ in order to visit the museum, I was impressed not only by the architecture of\
  \ the palace but the history and treasures on display too, every story reveal the\
  \ different arms , materials ,styles , plans , and tools used in each period of\
  \ time .\nDolmabahce is the modern oriental palace , a great building , so high\
  \ with so beautiful  garden , located along the European shore of the Bosphorus\
  \  trait .\nI also saw aqua florya aquarium ,the biggest thematic aquarium of the\
  \ world , very nicely arrange, clean , huge , and different types of fish inside\
  \ ,I enjoyed the variety of sea life presented, and because I like rain forest atmospheres,\
  \ I was glad to walk through one at the end .\nWhat I really  adored is Eminonu\
  \ and several tourist sites   , sea there had a strange voice , you feel like it\
  \ is holding you , everything in eminonu was so calm , so elegant and so powerful\
  \ too , I took the board from the port of Eminonu towards princes\u2019 island where\
  \ there is no car or bus except for bicycles , an island which is  full of flowers\
  \ and crowns , people there are so nice and civilized , there is not any noise ,trees\
  \ and nature there are fabulous .\nYou can also rent a horse drawn and choose between\
  \ a long route or a short one to visit the island.\nThe last place was taksim square\
  \ and Istiklal Street, taksim square contains the most important monument called\
  \ the independence monument, located at the beginning of istiklal Pedestrian Street,\
  \ also the monument is the center spot of official ceremonies in Istanbul.\nNext\
  \ to taksim square, there is istiklal street ,The long stretch boasts shops with\
  \ every product imaginable, cafes and restaurants, , bars, cinemas and more. I enjoyed\
  \ the groups of musicians there, the street was full of young guys and girls who\
  \ played guitar and another music instruments, they could make people happy and\
  \ joyful. The particularity of this street is the red trams which were renovated\
  \ and still used .\nAt the end of istiklal street , there is a tower called GALATA\
  \ tower , so high ,and  provides a panoramic view of the old town .\nThe most attractive\
  \  thing in Istanbul was really the mosques and their architecture and decoration\
  \ , sultanahmet mosque surrounding six slim minarets distinguish it from other mosques\
  \ ,right in Sultanahmet square ,suleymaniye mosque where the tombs of the sultan\
  \ ,his wife Hurrem and mimar sinan are found within its compounds , it\u2019s the\
  \ largest mosque of Istanbul with four minarets ,dolmabahce mosque is located on\
  \ the bosphorus , it is one of the highly decorated baroque \u2013style mosques\
  \ .there are two minarets , both have a gallery .\nWhat I was impressing by too\
  \ , is the bosphorus bridge , connecting the European and Asian sides of Istanbul\
  \ , actually  this bridge was a magic wand connecting two paradises on earth , European\
  \ paradise and Asian one . \nEvery morning and every day I wish coming back to \
  \ Istanbul ,it  was a wonderful experience, which I will never regret  , and despite\
  \ the rainy weather during my trip , but i enjoyed every moment there , and let\
  \ the rain of Istanbul wash away all my pain ."
