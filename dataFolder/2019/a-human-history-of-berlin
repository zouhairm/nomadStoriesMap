Text: "\u201CThose who cannot remember the past are condemned to repeat it.\u201D\
  \ - George Santayana.\n\nWe meet at the Neues Musuem. Like many of the tour guides\
  \ here in Berlin, Lena is a History student at the Humboldt University, but I quickly\
  \ learn that the journey we are about to embark upon will be more than just a recounting\
  \ of her academic research.\n\nLena is half German, half Lebanese. When the Lebanese\
  \ Civil War broke out in 1975 and divided its capital Beirut into the Muslim west\
  \ and the Christian east, Lena\u2019s mother Adeline fled to Germany with her parents.\
  \ Ripped from everything she knew, oblivious to whether or not her home was even\
  \ still standing, Berlin represented resilience and recovery for Adeline. Lena gestures\
  \ to the bullet holes on the columns that line the museum and states hopefully \u201C\
  surely a place so visibly marked with the scars of history couldn\u2019t ever suffer\
  \ a similar fate again\u201D.\n\nContinuing on to the infamous Checkpoint Charlie\
  \ (now an insipid facsimile of the original Cold War border crossing), I learn that\
  \ while Lena\u2019s mother was escaping religious persecution in Lebanon, her father\
  \ Markus was simultaneously experiencing an east/west divide of his own, growing\
  \ up in Soviet-controlled East Germany. We walk further along Zimmerstra\xDFe, following\
  \ the cobblestones that trace the former course of the Berlin Wall. \u201CMy parents\
  \ like to tell people that they met the night the Wall came down. They actually\
  \ met a few days before that, but they think it sounds more romantic.\u201D I agree,\
  \ picturing two rebellious, politically-minded students revelling in the streets\
  \ to a soundtrack of David Hasselhoff anthems. Exact dates aside, the reunification\
  \ of East and West Germany certainly marked the unification of Adeline and Markus.\n\
  \nWe approach the former Ministry of Aviation, one of the few Nazi buildings to\
  \ survive the allied bombings. It is intensely bleak, ominous and hostile. Early\
  \ brutalism meets socialist architecture, this vast (1,210,000 square feet to be\
  \ exact) and intimidating structure was G\xF6ring\u2019s base during the rule of\
  \ the Third Reich and oversaw all aviation matters, namely the Luftwaffe. Wherever\
  \ you stand on Wilhelmstra\xDFe, you are in its shadow. The neighbouring Topography\
  \ of Terror museum inhabits the site formerly occupied by the SS headquarters and\
  \ further fills the area with an unshakeable feeling of dread and deep sorrow. Here,\
  \ the significance of the Second World War even now, almost 80 years after its outbreak,\
  \ is palpable. I want to share Lena and Adeline\u2019s hope that we have learned\
  \ from the tragic divisions of the twentieth century, although I find myself drawing\
  \ unsettling parallels with the current rise of right-wing politics and a renewed\
  \ vision of wall building.\n\nLena talks of the profound sense of shame felt by\
  \ Germany, and particularly Berliners, at the end of the war; how Berlin was thrust\
  \ into a new era of confusion and mistrust, depriving the city of any recovery.\
  \ Many of her elderly relatives wanted to forget the atrocities of the war, but\
  \ the younger generations had fought for acknowledgement and remembrance.\n\nBy\
  \ now, we are almost at the Memorial to the Murdered Jews of Europe. We pause in\
  \ the nondescript car park of an equally ordinary apartment block. Lena explains\
  \ quietly, although there is no one else around, that this was the site of Hitler\u2019\
  s bunker. The characterlessness of this location is wholly deliberate. During the\
  \ years following the war, various attempts were made to destroy the bunker and\
  \ anonymise the site through fear it would become a shrine to Neo Nazis. An information\
  \ board detailing the history of the site was reluctantly erected in 2007 after\
  \ a tourism boom brought about by the Germany-hosted 2006 World Cup. Although the\
  \ board is controversial, Lena feels that it is a powerful illustration of Berlin\u2019\
  s recognition that to move on from the past, they had to look it in the face - no\
  \ matter how painful. The bitter February air is eerily still for a moment.\n\n\
  Never before have I visited a place like Berlin, where the past is so intrinsically\
  \ linked to the present. We move on to our final destination, aptly finishing the\
  \ tour at the Brandenburg Gate, a colossal monument to peace and unity."
