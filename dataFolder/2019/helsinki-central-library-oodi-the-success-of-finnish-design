Text: "The world of UX Design (user experience design) has been popping up quite often\
  \ lately. Designer friends excitedly explain to me the finer points of problem solving\
  \ and approaching every day situations from a design point of view. Their mission\
  \ is to make the world a more efficient and enjoyable place for humans. This week,\
  \ on my fourth visit to Finland, I finally realised that design thinking is what\
  \ makes me love this country so much. \n\nI haven\u2019t been able to articulate\
  \ my fondness for Finland very eloquently in the past. \u201CIt\u2019s just very\
  \ pleasant,\u201D is how I generally describe the country. Helsinki doesn\u2019\
  t have spectacular cathedrals or dramatic landscapes. It\u2019s not particularly\
  \ known for its cuisine or museums, yet I can\u2019t get enough of this city. It\u2019\
  s just an extremely pleasant place to be. I explained this to a Finnish friend once\
  \ who, in a very typically Finnish manner, paused for a quiet moment to reflect\
  \ and then said, \u201CI agree. I think that\u2019s why I\u2019ve never moved away.\u201D\
  \n\nMy first stop on this trip was to meet this very friend at Oodi, the new Helsinki\
  \ Central Library. I had read about the new, state-of-the-art building in the Finnish\
  \ news when it was inaugurated last December and was not exactly sure what all the\
  \ hype was about. The modern, Nordic-looking fa\xE7ade of the building was no surprise,\
  \ but as soon as I went inside, it became apparent that this library was built to\
  \ exceed expectations.\n\nI met Aino and as we road up a long escalator to the main\
  \ level, a vast open space appeared. I finally understood the hype. \u201CIt feels\
  \ like an indoor park,\u201D I said, somewhat in disbelief. At either end of the\
  \ massive space are two areas of large ascending platforms made to resemble hillsides.\
  \ Ramps and steps give access to the various levels and lounging areas, dotted with\
  \ massive bean bag chairs. As in most libraries, people study and read there, but\
  \ this is also a meeting point for Helsinki residents. I saw families and friends\
  \ talking quietly, playing chess, drawing and napping. Some were just strolling\
  \ around, seeking refuge from the freezing temperatures outside. The whole atmosphere\
  \ was active and dynamic, but with a calm stillness about it.\n\nThe lofted ceiling,\
  \ contoured like swells in the ocean, opens up into meticulously imprecise, round\
  \ skylights. Sunlight pours in onto trees and plants that add to the park-like feel\
  \ of this indoor oasis. And in between the two slopes of lounging plateaus lies\
  \ a sea of books. The stacks themselves have a lightness to them and are not overpacked.\
  \ You can almost see from one end of the library to the other, just peeking through\
  \ the shelves. In fact, many of the shelves were almost completely empty\u2014the\
  \ library is so popular it has trouble keeping the stacks full. \n\n\u201CThis library\
  \ was a gift from Finland to its people to celebrate the country\u2019s 100 years\
  \ of independence,\u201D Aino tells me. In giving this gift, it seems the government\
  \ really paid attention to the needs of the people. Every age group is present.\
  \ It caters to book lovers of course, but also offers up facilities for artists,\
  \ musicians and students. I saw industrial-sized printers, sewing machines, computers,\
  \ drawing tablets, 3D printers, recording studios, board games and meeting rooms,\
  \ all for use by the public. The main level features a caf\xE9, seamlessly integrated\
  \ into the indoor landscape, and downstairs a cafeteria-style restaurant even caters\
  \ to special diets with gluten-free and vegan options. They really thought of everything.\
  \ The public was clearly central to the design process. \n\nThis is why I love this\
  \ Nordic country. To me, Oodi represents how Finland functions. A problem was identified\u2014\
  lack of indoor public space in the city centre\u2014and then a user-centric design\
  \ was created, yielding a wildly popular final product. \u201CI\u2019m usually skeptical\
  \ of large construction projects like this, but I can\u2019t find anything wrong\
  \ with it,\u201D another Finnish friend commented to me. And therein lies the country\u2019\
  s charm. Finland simply provides its citizens with exceptionally well-designed and\
  \ pleasant user experiences."
