Text: "\u201CMy phone hit the treadmill when I was running Mama. The screen cracked\
  \ and now I can\u2019t call you for a while.\u201D My hands were shaking as I hung\
  \ up the payphone from the Toronto Pearson airport departure lounge. \n\nMy phone\
  \ was in perfect working condition. In fact I had just recently finished saving\
  \ an entire map of Iceland, but my parents did not need to know that. \nMy teeth\
  \ were well accustomed to the lies that slipped between them. There was no other\
  \ way I could disappear from my family\u2019s calls \u2013 3 times a day \u2013\
  \ to check up on me. Hanging up, I looked at my boyfriend and travel companion with\
  \ guilty eyes \u2013 another secret my family did not know about\n. \nLies and secrets,\
  \ manipulation and planning, this is how I hid from my traditional Pakistani life.\
  \ My work gave me the excuse to live away from home but cultural obligations and\
  \ cellphones did not allow me to truly escape. Iceland was meant to be excitement,\
  \ adventure, a romantic getaway with my secret lover, but the journey started as\
  \ another lie that weighed heavily in my heart.  \n\nI squeeze my eyes shut as the\
  \ plane takes off. I can\u2019t help but say a little prayer; not for our safe journey,\
  \ but for my fiction to hold through the trip. As the plane levels out, I feel the\
  \ weight on my heart slowly lift. No suitors for an arranged marriage can find me\
  \ so far up in the air. When we walk out of Keflav\xEDk International Airport, and\
  \ the cold glacier breeze sweeps across my face, I feel almost free. No god can\
  \ expect me to lower my gaze in the tall land of the Vikings. \n\nOur itinerary\
  \ is simple but full. The road we drive on winds over the rich volcanic soil and\
  \ the clear blue sky is interrupted by the jutting peaks of the ice-capped mountains.\
  \ The landscape mirrors my mind in all its opposing rebellion. \n\nWe spend our\
  \ days hunting for waterfalls; the icy \xD6xar\xE1rfoss, the powerful Sk\xF3gafoss\
  \ and the romantic Svartifoss whose steep climb knocks our breath away first. We\
  \ see the mighty mountains carved by unnamed waterfalls, patiently cutting the stubborn\
  \ rock over hundreds and thousands of years. \nWe walk between the Eurasian and\
  \ American tectonic plates, said to be drifting 3cm apart every year. Then we put\
  \ on snorkels and dive between the crystal clear waters of the Silfra fissure to\
  \ watch the world spread. \n\nWe throw on crampons and scale the Skaftafellsj\xF6\
  kull glacier, stopping to admire the hollows and caves the melting water creates.\
  \ It is said the water takes about 500 years to make it from the top of the glacier\
  \ to form the icicles we see at the base.\n \nWe stop to feel the valley tremble\
  \ at the angry eruptions of Geysir, the most active geyser in Iceland. It hurls\
  \ boiling water every 5-7 minutes to the frigid atmosphere, daring anyone to challenge\
  \ its power.\n\nStanding beside the cliffs of the Reynisfjall Mountain, watching\
  \ the waves crash against the black sand beach, one can\u2019t help but to feel\
  \ so small and insignificant to the Earth\u2019s blatant might. The Earth is alive\
  \ and breathing. She doesn\u2019t care about the social and cultural boundaries\
  \ imposed upon her inhabitants. \n\nWhether you come from her Western arm or her\
  \ Southern leg, she does not judge for who you fold your hands to. She does not\
  \ care who you love or what honour your job brings. She creates through lava and\
  \ teaches with water.\n\nI came to Iceland to find excitement and I found it. \n\
  \nI came to find adventure and I found it. \n\nI expected to find freedom but I\
  \ did not expect to find courage along with it. I am my pilot and where I take my\
  \ modest and precious life is my destination.\n\nWith my heart full of the dancing\
  \ lights from our last night, I know the day will come when my mother will hold\
  \ my future child and my father will bless my love, and I will tell my family about\
  \ how I found the strength of the fire and the patience of the ice."
