Text: "A slight chill bit the night as I disembarked from the train to Vienna.  The\
  \ journey so far had been nothing less than an adventure. I was still awestruck\
  \ from the train journey from Innsbruck to Vienna. The journey in which I was glued\
  \ to the widow seat of the train looking at the grandeur of the picturesque canvas\
  \ of snow clad mountains, cozy little houses along the way and the freshness of\
  \ the open country side.  \n\nI was dreading the routine exercise of searching for\
  \ local public transport in order to reach my hotel which was in the outskirts of\
  \ the city centre, so much for saving a couple of Euros, sigh! I took out my mobile\
  \ phone and accessed the \u2018Uber\u2019 application and tried booking a ride to\
  \ my hotel. Apparently \u2018Pay in cash\u2019 option was not accepted in this part\
  \ of Europe for the desired journey through \u2018Uber\u2019. A gush of cold wind\
  \ snatched away the city map which I purchased ahead of this journey. The map faded\
  \ into the darkness of the night. I entered my credit card details on the app and\
  \ finally booked an Uber ride, a very reassuring message popped up on my phone \u2018\
  ETA five minutes\u2019. This opportunity was nothing less than being \u2018heaven\
  \ sent\u2019 courtesy of the perks internet and technology has in store for us.\
  \ Those five odd minutes seemed like a lifetime in that harsh cold weather. A scant\
  \ few minutes later I literally exclaimed Eureka! When I spotted a confused looking\
  \ driver driving a rather fancy vehicle. I happily boarded the vehicle, the driver\
  \ started conversing in a broken Austrian accent. I could not understand a word\
  \ he was saying apart from his body language which later on became sign language\
  \ upon learning that he cannot converse in English. This was nothing short of an\
  \ achievement in itself since I managed to hold a conversation with him in English\
  \ and even my own native language and somehow we both comprehended the casual communication\
  \ that ensued during the journey.\n \nThe driver made his way to the hotel where\
  \ I was supposed to stay. He helped me with my luggage and I proceeded to check-\
  \ in at the reception. The hotel was quite nice in terms of the overall d\xE9cor\
  \ and furnishings. I rested a bit and checked out the travel app I just installed\
  \ in my mobile phone. I was excited to see that I had been invited by a group of\
  \ five other travelers to meet up at \u2018Alexanderplatz\u2019 in the city centre\
  \ for jointly exploring the city. I quickly accepted the offer and made my way to\
  \ the nearest bus station. A group of youngsters directed me to the bus which was\
  \ en-route to the city centre. Meanwhile it started snowing profusely and as I glanced\
  \ outside, the famous tower top of Alexanderplatz was in the line of sight. I was\
  \ shy of crossing the Rubicon, however still decided to get off at the next bus\
  \ stop and walk towards the rendezvous point. The temperature dropped down to sub-zero\
  \ and although I had covered myself in layers of warm clothes I regretted my decision\
  \ of walking in that unfavorable weather. It took me thirty minutes to finally arrive\
  \ at my destination. I could easily spot a young crowd gathered near the Christmas\
  \ tree which was our pre-determined rendezvous point. A causal meet and greet followed\
  \ and I was delighted to meet like-minded travelers from across the world. We headed\
  \ out to grab dinner/drinks at a local restaurant. \n\nOphelia was a social worker\
  \ from France, Sarah worked as a chef in Tennessee USA, Andrey was studying for\
  \ his undergrad degree in Italy and Marc was a British guy working as an English\
  \ teacher in Vienna, quite a diverse group. We talked about music, work aspirations,\
  \ our distinctive culture and each other\u2019s travel escapades which was very\
  \ interesting. We later on played a game of billiards in which I witnessed camaraderie,\
  \ support and above all friendship. Five complete strangers bonded on the love for\
  \ travel sans borders and nationalities, the feeling was priceless. That evening\
  \ in Vienna was the beginning of a friendship for lifetime!"
