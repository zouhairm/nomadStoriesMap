Text: "Rarely I have the chance to live such a stunning story, as I\u2019ve lived\
  \ this autumn on a mountain expedition. It was a fantastic three-day journey, where\
  \ I\u2019ve seen many wonderful places. I want to share with you this true miracle\
  \ happened up there on the mountain, where I made a friend for life. \nBucegi, the\
  \ most fabulous and mysterious mountains in Romania, has always attracted me like\
  \ a magnet. Many years I longed to climb his peak \u201EOmu\u201D The Man and to\
  \ see the famous Carpathian Sphinx. \nFinally, the great day arrived. I got there\
  \ with two friends on a plateau at 2000 m where we camped to reach the peak next\
  \ day. In the silence of the night, as we watched the starry sky, suddenly a big\
  \ dog appeared from nowhere. It looked me long in the eye and I felt it came to\
  \ me. Then immediately sat down to sleep at our feet. At first, we thought to defend\
  \ ourselves, but then we just were amazed at this strange appearance.\nAt dawn,\
  \ we headed our destination to The Man Peak and the dog came with us without calling,\
  \ as it was ours.\nIt accompanied us all the way back about 18 km, walking ahead\
  \ as if it knew our target. From time to time the dog looked back to see if we follow\
  \ him. Whenever we stopped to rest, it came to watch us like a good guard. We called\
  \ it \u201ERocky\u201D.\nJust before climbing the top, where the path was the hardest,\
  \ all of us felt that we want to give up. We run out of water, we were thirsty and\
  \ tired. We didn\u2019t feed the dog or gave him any water since joined us, but\
  \ amazingly it was attentive and friendly, letting us touch and hug him. \nIt helped,\
  \ guarded and gave us strength all the way until we reached the peak, altitude of\
  \ 2509 m. On the top looking around the mountains and horizon, we felt like we were\
  \ in another world. In the middle of the wild, we were protected by our guardian\
  \ angel.\nAt our descent, he accompanied us to the Babele Chalet where we were already\
  \ safe and disappeared. I searched for him but I didn\u2019t see him anymore. I\
  \ didn\u2019t even have time to say \"Thanks!\", I wanted to hug him once more,\
  \ I hoped to take him home, but I realized he might be \"The Angel of the Mountain\"\
  . He disappeared as it appeared from nowhere. It had only the mission to keep us\
  \ safe all the way back. I returned home a bit sad because I left him behind. Since\
  \ then, whenever I look at the Mountain, I feel like my angel is somewhere out there.\
  \ I miss it a lot! I hope to see it again at least once in my life. And I know what\
  \ shall I do for that: to climb the Mountain again..."
