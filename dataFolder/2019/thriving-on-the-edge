Text: "From the cliffs of Loop Head, in County Clare, you can spot seals and maybe,\
  \ according to local legend, a minke whale. \u201CYou\u2019ve picked a good time\
  \ to visit Ireland,\u201D says my improvised tour guide, Ailish Connolly. \u201C\
  The Atlantic is rarely this calm.\u201D With nothing but a lonely lighthouse for\
  \ company, standing on the most westerly tip of Clare is a humbling reminder of\
  \ how immense nature is.\n\nAilish drives us back to her art gallery, weaving between\
  \ rolling fields. \u201CAt the moment the school\u2019s thriving. We\u2019ve nearly\
  \ 40 children,\u201D she tells me. \u201CThere\u2019s nine leaving and four coming\
  \ this year. So that\u2019s not too bad.\u201D We go through Kilbaha village, passing\
  \ Keating\u2019s, the nearest bar to New York on this side of the Atlantic, and\
  \ a memorial to the great famine, commemorating the million who starved and the\
  \ other two million who were forced to emigrate. A quilt of green farmland spreads\
  \ out all around us, eventually giving way to the vast ocean.\n\nWe arrive at Kilbaha\
  \ Gallery and Ailish introduces me to her sister-in-law, and partner, Liz Greehy.\
  \ They are so similar: both dark hair, sunglasses and glowing smiles; both moved\
  \ away, completed degrees and lived in Dublin before moving back \u2018home\u2019\
  ; they have a knack for finishing one another\u2019s sentences, though they also\
  \ correct any wrong guesses. They usher me inside. Oil paintings lie beyond hand-designed\
  \ teapots, and bronze sculptures echo the work of the regions\u2019 great Iron smiths.\
  \ \u201COur gallery must be good enough for Kilbaha. It welcomes the world to our\
  \ community,\u201D Liz says. In the coffee shop, a young waitress pipes icing onto\
  \ a homemade carrot cake, laughing as a baby gurgles. Each customer that leaves\
  \ thanks Ailish and Liz by name.\n\n\u201CPeople are the lifeblood of every community.\
  \ To have people you need jobs and to have jobs you need industry,\u201D Ailish\
  \ says. \u201CBut any industry must respect the landscape.\u201D \n\nTour bus companies\
  \ tend not to do this. Many sightseeing packages involve unloading huge amounts\
  \ of tourists at different areas, in short intense bursts, before moving on. Indeed,\
  \ unsustainable tourism is ravaging Ireland\u2019s west coast: from the Cliffs of\
  \ Moher, featured in Harry Potter, which are in crisis management mode to deal with\
  \ huge visitor numbers; to County Kerry\u2019s Skellig Islands, featured in Star\
  \ Wars, which have seen more erosion in the last six years than the previous 200.\
  \ \n\n\u201CIt\u2019s all short term,\u201D Ailish says. \u201CLocally, those tourists\
  \ don\u2019t spend much\u2212\u201D \n\n\u201CThey just see the sights,\u201D Liz\
  \ interrupts. \u201CThen they\u2019re taken off to pre-booked restaurants and hotels.\
  \ But here the tour companies work for Kilbaha. It\u2019s our community. We want\
  \ to build something our children can come back to.\u201D \n\nI think about my own\
  \ family on my father\u2019s side. Three decades ago, himself, his sister and all\
  \ three of his brothers moved away from a nearby village, Quirren. They\u2019ve\
  \ ended up in Limerick, Dublin, Munich and Liverpool, where I grew up. Their cousins\
  \ from the next-door villages followed jobs to Galway, London, New York, Toronto,\
  \ Chicago and San Francisco. \n\n\u201CWe only let two bus companies visit Loop\
  \ Head, and they must be gone before 11am,\u201D says Ailish. \n\n\u201CAnd what\
  \ if they haven\u2019t?\u201D I ask.\n\n\u201CWe\u2019ll block the road with a tractor.\u201D\
  \ Ailish winks at me. \u201CAgain.\u201D \n\nWhen we say our goodbyes, they direct\
  \ me up the road to Castle Point, a place Charlotte Bront\xEB loved. Here a row\
  \ of people are fishing off the cliffs. Today, it\u2019s hard to believe that, on\
  \ her honeymoon, Bront\xEB observed \u2018such battling of waves with rocks as I\
  \ had never imagined\u2019. I come across a rusty metal plaque screwed onto a marble\
  \ lump. On it, a heartbroken family\u2019s poem mourns the consequences of \u2018\
  a tragic slip\u2019. In 2011, a man and his son were fishing when his line snagged\
  \ on the cliff face. A sudden gust of wind pushed him as he struggled to free the\
  \ line. The 6-year-old boy witnessed his father fall, helpless to do anything but\
  \ watch.\n\n\u201CYou must respect the landscape,\u201D Liz had said as we parted.\
  \ Standing above the Atlantic, I watch a lone cormorant bob on the waves."
