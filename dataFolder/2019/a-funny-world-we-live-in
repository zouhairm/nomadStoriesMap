Text: "Being an architecture student, you kinda seem through see things in different\
  \ perspective. It's like you've a different site of goggles on , here's the experience\
  \ of my North India tour. We started from Chennai, South India to New Delhi, North\
  \ India. Passing through the different boundaries of the states like, Andra Pradesh,\
  \ Karnataka, Maharashtra you could sense a difference. Being it the language of\
  \ the locals or their cuisine. The buildings spoke their story of what place we've\
  \ been. We reached New Delhi after two days of train travel , which was spent gazing\
  \ through the agriculture fields , and some local ceremonies happening in the small\
  \ town temple or the boulders of the hills we pass through. You may take a glance\
  \ of the map , everything seem so near. Yet, so far away. Delhi has its own crazy\
  \ vibe and we set out to check in our rooms and head to site visit. Mughal architecture\
  \ stands out in the planned city of Delhi designed by Le Corbusier. After a day\
  \ strolling with the same touristy place. After 7 please we decided to check out\
  \ the local area where we stayed near our hotel. A market place raving with loads\
  \ of people coming in and out seemed like a honey comb, except we didn't know who\
  \ was the queen bee. The locals we're friendly and helped out in directions, although\
  \ we had our Google maps on. The next day we left to Chandigarh , the gird city.\
  \ The easiest city where one can't be lost that easily. We had to stop to see the\
  \ capitol. Then for the tea break we head for the park, so many old and young couples\
  \ having the time of their life , there was a boating club as well. It was pouring\
  \ down rain and with a great cup of horrible coffee as the server forgot to add\
  \ some sugar. Still enjoyed the cup of coffee with the amazing climate with the\
  \ fantastic view. Trees and bushes along side the pathway facing the lake. Wow.\
  \ Then we headed to Punjab, my favorite place. It was still pouring like cats and\
  \ dogs. We had to visit the Golden temple. After we reached our destination, after\
  \ I got down from the share auto . There was water above my ankle , my sandals were\
  \ wet. We had to walk to the temple before that we went to see the Jallian Wala\
  \ bagh. It was a surreal experience to witness the freedom struggle our ancestors\
  \ had to go through. A emotional moment when I saw the bullet marks on the wall\
  \ and the well where people fell into. You can feel the pain and suffering once\
  \ you've been to such a place, the atmosphere changes. Then we headed to the temple,\
  \ greeted my Sikhs and they were cleaning up the place 24/7. Regardless how harsh\
  \ the rain is they made sure the floor ain't skiddy and no water stagnants. Amazing\
  \ hardworking people. Yet through when you enter what do you see, a massive crowd\
  \ getting in . Just to get blessings from the shrine. Next we had to leave to Rajasthan.\
  \ The places we had to cover were Jaipur, Jaisalmar and Jodhpur. Amazing and simply\
  \ beautiful. The intricate works on the buildings facade and the rich history they\
  \ have . The culture and hospitality , it's so warm. Where we live it's just a small\
  \ place, once to travel you'd know how vast and how human thrives and has survived\
  \ to create a community. We should be more grateful as we get \nmore opportunities\
  \ to explore and experience this crazy rollercoaster of life."
