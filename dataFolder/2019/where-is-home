Text: "It\u2019s been nine days since I\u2019ve first arrived in the UK. Flying from\
  \ my home country of Australia to the other side of the world, let alone a continent\
  \ I\u2019d never set foot in, to live here for two years definitely constitutes\
  \ a \u2018leap into the unknown\u2019 in my eyes. \n\nNow, I\u2019m not exactly\
  \ inexperienced when it comes to uprooting my entire life and moving to a place\
  \ where I know nobody; I\u2019ve done that twice already in my life. The first,\
  \ was to China for a year. And after that, it was to a different city. And now,\
  \ it\u2019s literally the opposite end of the world\u2014where the time difference\
  \ is practically twelve hours and all my family back home are sleeping when I\u2019\
  m awake. It\u2019s pretty lonely!\n\nNonetheless, here I am, on this new continent\
  \ full of old structures and buildings that Australia would only dream of having\
  \ in its comparatively young, fledgling history.\n\nMy first impressions of Europe\u2014\
  are that though there are similarities with Australia, it\u2019s still vastly different,\
  \ and how it compares to Asia? Well, they\u2019re two worlds apart.\n\nThe funny\
  \ thing is, I\u2019m an Australian of Asian descent. Which means, that in my home\
  \ country I\u2019m often mistaken for a tourist even though I was born there. In\
  \ Asia, I fit right in! But it couldn\u2019t be further from the truth\u2014I look\
  \ Asian on the outside but my attitudes and values are completely western and very\
  \ progressive compared to Asian societal and cultural values.\n\nSo when I land\
  \ in Europe and particularly where I am now, in Edinburgh\u2014almost everybody\
  \ is of Anglo Saxon background and I get looks here and there because of my appearance.\
  \ Not only that, but a solo Asian-looking woman eating alone at a restaurant? Just\
  \ multiply the number of head turns.\n\nWhy do I keep moving to different places?\
  \ What am I searching for?\n\nPerhaps I\u2019m trying to find my home, where I fit\
  \ in. But, it\u2019s occurred to me now that no matter where I go, this place doesn\u2019\
  t exist. If I go to a western country I look like a tourist though my values and\
  \ attitudes are the same as the locals. If I go to an Asian country I look just\
  \ like everyone else but my internal radar knows that I\u2019m an alien there.\n\
  \nIt\u2019s a tough world we live in, and I don\u2019t even have it that bad. \n\
  \nNow, I\u2019m here in this new city and new life, trying to find my place in this\
  \ world. It\u2019s new, it\u2019s adventurous, but it\u2019s god damn scary. And\
  \ knowing there is no safety net this time, no one to turn to like before when the\
  \ going gets tough, is no consolation to my mind.\n\nWhere will I be sleeping tomorrow\
  \ night? Where or what, is home?\n\nIn the end, as a now-seasoned traveller, my\
  \ home and my safety is the turbulent place that is my mind. \n\nAs a coping strategy,\
  \ I\u2019ve invented a way where the space inside my head is my own comfort, and\
  \ it works. As long as I can go inside my head with some peace and quiet, that is\
  \ my one true home, wherever I may go in this world.\n\nAnd whatever the unknown\
  \ brings next, I know I can conquer it."
