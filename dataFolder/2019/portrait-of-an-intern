Text: "The summer of 2005 I lived in Moscow, Russia. I was on my college internship\
  \ working in the American Embassy. There were countless adventures with the other\
  \ interns but when summer ended they left. I was lucky enough to stay through autumn.\
  \ When touristing I had relied on the language skills of those more experienced.\
  \ Would I now be courageous enough to head out on my own?\n\nStariy Arbat was my\
  \ go-to spot to people watch. It\u2019s a tourist trap but in typical Moscow fashion\
  \ any open space with places to sit becomes a gathering in nice weather. The Arbat\
  \ is a storied area with a long history. It\u2019s now a commercial pedestrian walk.\
  \ Overpriced souvenirs, street performers, and artists line both sides. As an art\
  \ major I was drawn to the portrait artists. One evening I resolved to buy a street\
  \ portrait. It\u2019s the kind of souvenir I\u2019d always wanted and something\
  \ my parents would never let me buy. My choice of artist was intentional; I had\
  \ to like their aesthetic and someone approachable I might have a conversation with.\
  \ At the end of the gauntlet was a pair sitting close together. A man and woman\
  \ about twenty years older than me. They laughed freely. He chain smoked and she\
  \ poured coffee from a thermos. She gestured, saying, \u201CCome. Sit. I\u2019m\
  \ Galya. You want a portrait?\u201D\n\nI asked the price and didn\u2019t haggle\
  \ on it. Galya pointed to her collapsible stool, turned the page of her sketch pad\
  \ and began immediately. As a drawer myself, who\u2019s always had a death grip\
  \ on my implement, I was in awe how she skimmed across the page with such loose\
  \ strokes. The man rose and stood behind Galya\u2019s shoulder. He smiled and said,\
  \ \u201CI\u2019m Yuri.\u201D \n\nBoth artists flicked their eyes between me and\
  \ the paper. Yuri made an occasional comment. I couldn\u2019t tell if it was a critique\
  \ or praise. I\u2019d sat as a subject for artwork in school. It\u2019s always unnerving\
  \ and the closer your proximity to the artist the more intimate it becomes. I was\
  \ transfixed on locking eyes with Galya. I was determined to not move at all. Galya\
  \ was focused and squinting but at one point exclaimed, \u201CYou\u2019re a sphinx!\
  \ Motionless. It\u2019s good.\u201D\n\nWhen Galya\u2019s strokes and smudges slowed\
  \ Yuri said, \u201CStop. It\u2019s finished. You\u2019ll ruin it.\u201D \n\nShe\
  \ scrutinized one more time but agreed. We all looked at each other expectantly.\
  \ I joined them at the easel. \u201CYou like it?\u201D Galya asked.\n\nI nearly\
  \ cried, \u201COh, Galya. Yes. I love it.\u201D \n\nIt was an idealized version\
  \ of myself. The shadows on my face were dramatic with an imagined light source.\
  \ Lipstick was indicated though I wasn\u2019t wearing any. She captured my thick,\
  \ unruly hair. I counted my rubles and offered Galya more than she\u2019d negotiated.\
  \ She refused but I insisted the portrait was worth more. She thanked me profusely.\
  \ She rolled the drawing into a plastic sleeve, we all shook hands and said goodbye\
  \ multiple times.\n\nI returned a few weekends later. They were both there. I exclaimed,\
  \ \u201CYuri this time!\u201D I asked how much he charged but he wanted to draw\
  \ me gratis. I was firm. He agreed on a price lower than Galya\u2019s. I tried to\
  \ talk more during this sitting. I asked where they'd studied art. Galya didn\u2019\
  t look at Yuri\u2019s easel while he worked. She'd break conversation to solicit\
  \ passersby. Yuri was intense yet doubting. When he finished he had a private moment\
  \ with his drawing as if to say, \u201CWell, it\u2019s as good as it\u2019s going\
  \ to get.\u201D \n\nI was blown away. Where Galya\u2019s portrait had been idealized\
  \ and gave a sense of determination this one was me. In Yuri\u2019s I looked like\
  \ the barely-out-of-youth adult I was, uncertain and sentimental. This was why I\
  \ wanted two portraits; two completely unique perspectives of me. \nIt\u2019s been\
  \ thirteen years since then. Both of my portraits are still unframed and rarely\
  \ viewed but every once in a while I\u2019ll unroll them. There were many pictures\
  \ taken of me that summer but if you want to know exactly who I was at that point\
  \ in time look at Yuri\u2019s portrait."
