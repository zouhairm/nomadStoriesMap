Text: "The gravel crunched beneath the tires of the commercial van, as it drove into\
  \ the empty parking lot. There was a folding table with papers on it, tour guides\
  \ around it, and an industrial building behind all the activity. This is not where\
  \ I anticipated my day-trip to Saona Island to start. Here I was, along with dozens\
  \ of other tourists, dazed and confused before eight o\u2019clock in the morning.\n\
  \tI wondered if I had made a mistake in booking this tour last-minute, less than\
  \ twelve hours prior. I felt that I should have opted to stay at the resort, and\
  \ that this excursion would not be as grand as the all-inclusive resort I would\
  \ have had all-day access to had I stayed in Punta Cana. I stepped out of the van,\
  \ along with the other tourists, into the open parking lot. The van drove away.\
  \ The feeling in the pit of my stomach hit once again; I felt like I\u2019d made\
  \ a less than stellar choice for how to spend one of my few days in Dominican Republic.\n\
  \tI walked up to the folding table to inquire about my tour. It seemed that many\
  \ of us were taking day trips to Saona Island, but with different modes of transportation.\
  \ The gentleman with a walkie-talkie explained that we would have to wait and that\
  \ transportation would be arriving very soon. Very soon turned into an hour and\
  \ a half. I now understood why this tour was quoted at being a half-day. At least\
  \ two hours were dedicated to waiting around for transportation. This also clarified\
  \ why they didn\u2019t give us the local time when we landed. Our flight attendants\
  \ had told us, \u201CYou\u2019re on vacation so it doesn\u2019t matter.\u201D I\
  \ however, had less than 72 hours in Punta Cana, therefore, I wanted to use my time\
  \ efficiently. So far, I\u2019d spent it waiting in a gravel parking lot with no\
  \ coach buses in sight.\n\tThe busses rolled into the parking lot, on island time,\
  \ around 9:30 a.m. I felt quite enthused considering the circumstances, but the\
  \ tour had yet to begin. By 9:45 a.m. our tour guide Angel boarded the bus and we\
  \ were off. It didn\u2019t make sense to me that we boarded a coach bus, when our\
  \ tour was a speed-boat to Saona Island with a catamaran back, but I was on the\
  \ bus and open to the experience. I secretly hoped I hadn\u2019t wasted my one full\
  \ day on the island. \n\tLess than an hour later, our bus pulled off the paved road\
  \ onto a dirt one. I could see a blue outhouse and many cars parked in the open\
  \ space. Beyond that were small spaces created for vendors of tourist trinkets.\
  \ Each vendor was separated by plywood and a tarp or sheet, to shade the shopkeeper\
  \ from the sun. As everyone exited the bus, men approached us with live iguanas.\
  \ The expectation was that we\u2019d pay them to take a photo with it. I skirted\
  \ around the opportunity and followed our guide towards the beach.\n\tFurther down\
  \ the public beach were boats, and a few speed boats were pulling up towards shore.\
  \ This looked promising. My day was turning around, at 10:30 a.m. It only took three\
  \ hours for the excursion to finally begin.\n\tThe speed-boat ride was phenomenal.\
  \ It was faster than the first few hours of the day. It was less than a half-hour\
  \ before we were at a natural pool, created by sand bars in the Caribbean. It wasn\u2019\
  t an isolated experience, as promised, but the other tour groups were just as gracious\
  \ and the boats were spread out in the area. It reminded me of Big Island on Lake\
  \ Minnetonka. I reminded myself to send a group text, that we should coordinate\
  \ a group trip to the Caribbean for a boat party, to replace our annual one in Minnesota.\
  \ \n\tIt was ten minutes beyond the natural pool to Saona Island. The beach was\
  \ exquisite, serene and exceeded all expectations. The Caribbean-style lunch was\
  \ delicious, the beverages quenched my thirst and the catamaran ride back felt like\
  \ a dance party back to Punta Cana. Someday, I will return to Saona Island!"
