Text: "When you grow up in a country, you become immune to the beauty and wonder that\
  \ is right on your doorstep. You become fascinated with other worlds and other national\
  \ treasures that you forget that you\u2019ve barely scraped the surface of your\
  \ home. \nI grew up in Rural Queensland, Australia (no where you\u2019ve heard of)\
  \ - actually, the only reason why my hometown was known of (even locally) was because\
  \ of its not quite famous title \u2018The Beef Capital of Australia\u2019 (complete\
  \ with an abundance of bull statues throughout). This fact never stuck me as strange,\
  \ nor did the fact that just 20 minutes away I could step out into the Great Barrier\
  \ Reef (the largest living organism in the world no less). I found these things\
  \ normal and accepted them as part of everyday life. I\u2019ve always considered\
  \ Australia beautiful, whether it was the outback deserts that frosted over in the\
  \ dead of morning, or the depths of the reef at sunset where everything turned liquid\
  \ gold - but what I didn\u2019t expect was the beauty I\u2019d find the ordinary\
  \ parts of my country. People visit all over to see Uluru or the Sydney Harbour\
  \ Bridge or perhaps experience someone greeting you with \u201Cg\u2019day mate\u201D\
  , but what they don\u2019t realise (and what I hadn\u2019t realised before either)\
  \ was that Australia was rich in culture, in fellowship and in the beauty of the\
  \ ordinary just waiting to be discovered. As a kid I was constantly travelling around\
  \ Australia; my parents were 4WD enthusiasts and created a club for such. Because\
  \ of this, I knew Australia like the back of my hand and it wasn\u2019t until I\
  \ was older that I realised how lucky I was. It wasn\u2019t because of the natural\
  \ wonders that kept tourism alive but it was the people I\u2019d met, and the way\
  \ Australian\u2019s just were there to make the world a better place. Rural Queensland\
  \ is disaster prone, with flooding, cyclones and bushfires being Summer\u2019s usual\
  \ menu of events - and you\u2019d think, why would anyone want to live there then?\
  \ Firstly, when my maths teachers house was destroyed by Cyclone Marcia, my school\
  \ fund raised to have it rebuilt. When my best friends house had a tree fall on\
  \ it, the community offered up shelter food and supplies to help them out. When\
  \ bushfires plagued farmlands and killed cattle and crops, not only where there\
  \ SES members and the Army, but among them where civilians and local business owners\
  \ willing to put their communities safety, hunger and lives before the overwhelming\
  \ profit of the capitalist society we live in. They didn\u2019t have to, in fact,\
  \ I knew a lot of people that lost a great deal of money, supplies and business\
  \ but that\u2019s what was so beautiful about it. You can spend your life traveling\
  \ to see beautiful things, but how many times do you see the beauty of people as\
  \ they are, doing ordinary things in extraordinary circumstances? It still never\
  \ ceases to amaze me and I\u2019ve never felt more proud of the small town I\u2019\
  m from. I\u2019ve never left Australia so I\u2019ve never been able to write about\
  \ anywhere else but here, but I want to. I want to be able to capture the beauty\
  \ of the landscapes and look deeper into the people that create that beauty from\
  \ the ground up. Australia is one country of hundreds, so I can\u2019t help but\
  \ marvel in the mysteries of the extraordinary found elsewhere. \nHow many stories\
  \ are left unwritten in places we\u2019re yet to hear about? And will there ever\
  \ be enough time to write them all?"
