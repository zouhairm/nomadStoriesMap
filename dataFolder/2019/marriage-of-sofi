Text: "\u201CA leap into the unknown\u201D\nThis theme explains that how much we were\
  \ in exhilarating state as we were going to do the task that takes too much adventure\
  \ with itself \u201COhh My God\u201D I am feeling really thrilled as it is the travel\
  \ story that explain about love without any blood relation, enjoyment with family,\
  \ nature that has infinity beauty and many other over joyed item. \nA person who\
  \ was a servant at our home but means more than a servant to us he was not mentally\
  \ perfect as having some brain issues but wants to get married. According to his\
  \ state of mind it was very difficult for us to take decision but however we decided\
  \ to go and find out a girl for him. We decided to go to the place where someone\
  \ told us that there you could find a girl. The name of that place was Abbaspur\
  \ that lies in beautiful valley of Azad Jammu & Kashmir. We heard that Abbaspur\
  \ was very far but at that time it was difficult for us to tell how many hours would\
  \ be enough to reach on that place. \nWe packed our bags took some snacks and cookies\
  \ with us, as that place was really cold we put our shawls and sweaters with us.\
  \ Our whole family (My father, mother, Uncle, Aunts, Siblings with my ten to thirteen\
  \ cousins) hired a van. We were in a jubiliant mood and anxious about what would\
  \ happen with us.  As our \u201Cwould be groom\u201D was not so young as he passed\
  \ his normal age of marriage we used to color his hair and beard black.  We were\
  \ now in a ready state to go to Abbaspur. Van started and our journey as well with\
  \ songs. After some time we stopped that music and all family members remind their\
  \ childhood memories. \nI was very happy and wondering about that how God glamorously\
  \ provide his blessing to every person. Our servant whose name was Sofi had no blood\
  \ relation with us but our family was ready to make him happy and for him we used\
  \ to travel so long. Van was passing through greenery and meadows were there to\
  \ present dazzling scene to us. Mountains with their 3D character made our eye glory\
  \ full. I was feeling that i entered into a heaven. Buffaloes and cows in meadows\
  \ represent a charming scene. I can\u2019t explain in words that how that wind pinched\
  \ into my heart. It was the travel of six hours but in those hours I found my family\
  \ love in van, Sofi\u2019s happiness, mountains calmness and greenery\u2019s hotness,\
  \ nature that reminds me there is a God that who made everything in order. We were\
  \ pilling Sofi\u2019s leg and he was spreading million dollar smile everywhere.\n\
  \ It was a travel that I will never forget in my life. We were not fully assured\
  \ that girl would be perfect or she would like our family or not . Anyhow, we were\
  \ travelling with this thought. At half of our way we found a place named \u201C\
  Taat\u201D. We stopped van and opened van\u2019s door and moved outside we captured\
  \ pictures of rocks, and felt sound of river flow, vibrant trees that moved here\
  \ and there like a dreamy way. We moved back to our and after some time we reached\
  \ to our final destination. After reaching we got to know that they are poor and\
  \ can\u2019t afford any party time. \nI was afraid of Sofi\u2019s clamor as he was\
  \ also not mentally fine and at that time we were in a new place.  We all ate and\
  \ made further plans, we went outside of the muddy house. There was muddy environment\
  \ all the way. Children out there had dirty clothes and nose. We gave them candies\
  \ and chocolates and their smile feels us all. Finally after gossips and rejection\
  \ for that girl by sofi, we were ready to go back home. We were on our van had some\
  \ technical issue, there was a cottage and we saw some people coming out, they helped\
  \ us by arranging the meal and another van for us and them I was completely fallen\
  \ in greenery of Kashmir."
