  \ The call disconnected and I glumly let my friend know the booking desk had informed\
  \ me we wouldn\u2019t be flying over Milford Sound today. I had expected her to\
  \ be relieved. Her fear of heights and flying keeping her awake at night, researching\
  \ the expected travel time. Instead she expressed the same longing to see the famous\
  \ fiord from high above. \n\n\u201CHopefully tomorrow if the weather is good,\u201D\
  \ I told her cheerily although feeling guilty I had convinced someone with terrible\
  \ fears of planes and high altitudes to come with me on this birthday expedition.\
  \ I was confused by her turn of emotions. She reiterated the same sentiment that\
  \ we\u2019d hopefully fly the next day although hours before that, the glow of her\
  \ phone kept me awake as it lit up her face while she endlessly scrolled through\
  \ the booking details. \n\nLuckily, she hadn\u2019t researched the size of the plane.\
  \ Waiting in a designated seating area inside the offices of the flight company,\
  \ I stumbled upon the seating number of the plane we were about to board. The weather\
  \ was fine today and there was no wind so we\u2019d been picked up and taken to\
  \ the nearby runway where the planes would take off, starting our adventure. \u201C\
  I won\u2019t go in anything that\u2019s less than a ten-seater plane,\u201D my friend\
  \ stubbornly told me, her voice cracking in fear. I laughed nervously. \u201CWhat\u2019\
  s funny?\u201D she demanded. I couldn\u2019t tell her the plane only held six seats\
  \ (including the pilot). \n\nI guess the money we\u2019d already spent booking the\
  \ flight motivated my friend to do it anyway because when she saw the tiny plane,\
  \ her worst fears were confirmed. I guiltily turned to her as her eyes widened in\
  \ disbelief. \u201CWe\u2019ll sit together,\u201D I smiled, hoping to comfort her.\
  \ A family of three boarded before us which left a seat at the back in addition\
  \ to the highly desired co-pilot seat. \u201CDo you want to be co-pilot today?\u201D\
  \ the pilot asked me while I stood with my friend near the plane. My face beamed\
  \ with excitement as I turned to my friend to share my good fortune, but my smile\
  \ quickly disappeared as I remembered I had promised we\u2019d sit together. \u201C\
  Go,\u201D she simply said. \u201CYou\u2019d regret it if you didn\u2019t. I would\
  \ rather freak out by myself without people watching.\u201D\n\nI boarded the plane\
  \ from the other side, the co-pilot door open. I turned back towards my friend,\
  \ giving her a thumbs up and she selflessly smiled at me while holding onto a laminated\
  \ paper, detailing the safety instructions in case of emergency, proceeding to read\
  \ them carefully. \u201CSee those pedals beneath you? You can rest your feet on\
  \ them but don\u2019t push down on them. They do actually control the plane.\u201D\
  \ My head whipped round to see the pilot talking to me. Looking down at the metal\
  \ pedals beneath, I snapped my feet closer to my seat and away from them. Laughing,\
  \ he turned and walked around to board his own seat. \n\nThe tiny plane took off\
  \ while I glanced back at my friend breathing out forcibly, mouth open and eyes\
  \ closed, as if she were about to give birth. It was a smooth take off however and\
  \ we meandered through mountains, gazing at lush waterfalls and dregs of leftover\
  \ ice higher in the rock peaks. I had the best view, peering out the front of the\
  \ aircraft and to my side, capturing photos quickly while staring in awe at New\
  \ Zealand\u2019s beauty. A mix of blue and white beneath me showcased a stunning\
  \ river, the water moving through the ice, resembling branches of a tree stripped\
  \ of all its leaves amongst fallen snow. \n\nIt seemed to end too soon when the\
  \ plane landed effortlessly in Milford Sound. Turning back, my friend nodded and\
  \ raised her eyebrows at me, signs of her approval of the safe arrival. Now we only\
  \ had to return via the same plane to Queenstown. My friend wished to stay in the\
  \ back seat."
