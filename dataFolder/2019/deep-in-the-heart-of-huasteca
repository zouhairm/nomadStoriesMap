Text: "Deep In The Heart of Huasteca\n\nIt was only 8 a.m. but the day was going downhill\
  \ fast. We had been zig zag travelling around Mexico and were hoping to slow the\
  \ pace down with a little forest bathing. We were seeking waterfalls, nature and\
  \ surrealistic art in Xilitla (pronounced \u201Chee-leet-la\u201D) deep in the green\
  \ Huasteca rainforests of San Luis Potos\xED. But THIS morning a tour company had\
  \ forgotten to pick us up.\n\nWith only three days to explore the area, we were\
  \ not keen on spending a day in town. There was just too much to see in the jungle\
  \ all around us. While we tried to deal with our disbelief and disappointment and\
  \ come up with a new plan, Tati, the manager at our posada jumped on the phone.\
  \ \n\nEnter Eva and her rusty, but trusty, monster of an F-150 supercab truck named\
  \  \u201CGuerrero\u201D (Warrior).\n\n\u201CIt would be my pleasure to spend the\
  \ day with you\u201D she began, in a way that made it sound as if we were the ones\
  \ coming to her rescue instead of the other way around. \u201CEveryone goes to the\
  \ cascadas (waterfalls) and the art at Las Posas\u201D she announced, \u201Cbut\
  \ I want to show you MY Huasteca.\u201D\n\nHow could we resist? \n\nThat\u2019s\
  \ when a day that started out sour turned into magic. We couldn\u2019t believe our\
  \ luck as we took it all in. \n\nDriving around Xilitla is not for the faint of\
  \ heart. Picture twisting roads, mostly up and then terrifyingly down, with not\
  \ a shoulder or guard rail in sight.  \u201CMy father was an engineer.  He designed\
  \ some of these roads\u201D she told us, pride obvious in her voice, over the grinding\
  \ gears, random downshifting, and small squeaks of alarm and \u201Cwows!\u201D \
  \ coming from me in the back seat as I peered out over the occasional abyss. My\
  \ head was spinning. Where ARE the seatbelts? Will the clutch hold? Nothing like\
  \ a little fear, wonder and a few topes (speed bumps) to keep me on the edge of\
  \ my seat. \n\nWe quickly connected through chatter that pushed the limits of our\
  \ Spanish and Eva\u2019s English. As the day sped by, the sabor, or flavour, of\
  \ Huasteca emerged as the truck cab filled up with stories, songs and memories that\
  \ burbled out of Eva like the rivers that sometimes flowed alongside us. \n\nOur\
  \ pace slowed as we followed giant fruit trucks overflowing with oranges and were\
  \ swept up in mini traffic jams created by the harvest. It slowed even more as we\
  \ stopped again and again for  \u201Cjust a little snack\u201D made from local fruit\
  \ in every colour. \n\nI don\u2019t know if I fell a little in love with Eva and\
  \ her magical home on the two minute round trip on the Ferry to Nowhere, or as we\
  \ walked, dripping wet from floating in a crystal clear lagoon, through a quiet\
  \ community scented with bougainvillea to what felt like a sacred place in The Cave\
  \ Where Two Mountains Kiss. Maybe it was as I was being blessed, swatted with foliage\
  \ during a limpia (cleansing) by a local Healer, with chocolate and sage scented\
  \ air all around me that it happened?  But I was so grateful to have been left behind....\
  \ to be in Eva\u2019s world for this glimpse into local life on a tour that Eva\
  \ just might have been making up as we went along. \n\nI learned a few lessons about\
  \ open-hearted generosity and hospitality from Tati and the ever-smiling Eva that\
  \ day. I didn't expect to, but that\u2019s what made the experience so precious.\n\
  \n\u201CNow you know my beautiful home \u201D said Eva as she dropped us off. \u201C\
  You keep a piece of my Huasteca with you until you come back\u201D. \n\nYes Eva,\
  \ I will."
