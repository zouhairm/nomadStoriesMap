Text: "Having traveled to some eighty countries, I usually time my visits to coincide\
  \ with the best weather possible - the sunniest, least rained-out, but still not\
  \ over crowded period were bargains still exist and there is plenty of space to\
  \ enjoy the sights and sounds. So visiting Norway in winter, where the sun only\
  \ peaks a few degrees above the horizon each day and the nights are bitterly cold\
  \ and long would seem to be poor timing. But I wanted to hunt for the Aurora Borealis\
  \ and winter in Norway is the best time to witness the Aurora. \n\nI arrived in\
  \ Oslo the end of January where each day has barely four hours of daylight. Expecting\
  \ a city frozen over, I found a Norwegian attitude not written about in any of my\
  \ research. The cold - and it was well below minus 10 degrees Celsius every day\
  \ - was not a deterrent to enjoying each day. \nThe Norwegian embraces the winter\
  \ as much as they embrace their endless summer nights. \n\nCold challenges the Norwegian\
  \ and they do not shrink from that challenge: babies in prams with large wheels\
  \ being pushed by fathers and mothers over ice and snow; spikes that slip over shoes\
  \ to prevent an evening out from ending too soon; fat wheeled bicycles climbing\
  \ snow packed hills, icy roads, and even stairs. Walkers wear red and green armband\
  \ lights as they walk on trails from one part of a village to another and these\
  \ trails are everywhere encouraging people to forego their cars, or the bus, or\
  \ the train. There is little the Norwegian has not innovated to accommodate to the\
  \ winter. \n\nSo dressed in layers of clothing I went out and lived the Norwegian\
  \ cold. I downhill skied in a park near the city; I tobogganed the a mile long run\
  \ there as well, and then went on the metro back up the hill and did it again and\
  \ again (yes the metro takes you back up the hill). I walked with my wife throughout\
  \ the city. In Vigeland Park, we saw hundreds of outdoor sculptures depicting Norwegian\
  \ life and myth. That night we climbed the roof of the National Opera House and\
  \ then walked back into the city to enjoy a cold Aass beer and burger at Dognville\
  \ - a popular restaurant whose name means 'jet-lag'. \n\nWhen the time came to leave\
  \ Oslo for Alta, a small village above the Arctic Circle, to hunt for the Northern\
  \ Lights, I was excited to be outside in the minus 22 degrees Celsius, waiting and\
  \ watching for the Aurora and when the Northern Lights appeared, I was child like\
  \ in my happiness, clicking my rental camera, excited to see a second later what\
  \ I had captured. Despite the cold, almost unaware of it, I saw my wife and fellow\
  \ travelers lie in the snow and watch the Northern Lights stream and dance overhead.\
  \ \n\nDuring the day, I snow shoed across frozen rivers, drove a dog sled, toured\
  \ a Sami village and learned their history and that of their reindeer. At meals\
  \ when I asked the Norwegians about the hardships of winter - the cold, the ice,\
  \ the snow- they returned a look of slight confusion. \"We dress for it - We can't\
  \ wait to go out -The children love it,\" was repeated in multiple variations. The\
  \ answer, \"Going into the mountains\",  was almost a Norwegian mantra as they described\
  \ the best part of living in Norway -even in winter.\n\nAfter years of traveling,\
  \ I learned something in Norway - weather is part of the adventure. Be it cold or\
  \ hot or anything in between, my travel enjoyment is almost completely dependent\
  \ on me, my preparations, and my attitude."
