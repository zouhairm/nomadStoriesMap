Text: "It\u2019s an early morning weekday in the dusty busy streets of South Africa.\
  \ In this week of 2011 my eyes were opened for this first time to the beauty of\
  \ this nation. It is quite easy to focus on our high unemployment rate, domestic\
  \ violence and shameful crime rate. Thousands of people were on their way to work\
  \ on this particular day and I took a taxi (public transportation) to school for\
  \ the very first time. Adventure is destined to people whose eyes are wide open\
  \ to the beauty of this world. You may get to travel the world or be in the same\
  \ place for a long time and still be adventurous. Every single person has a choice\
  \ in how they are going to see the world. The beauty however, is when you notice\
  \ things that are not recognised commonly. \n\nHowever, I have been in awe by everyday\
  \ South Africans who have made a way for \nthemselves. On my way to school I had\
  \ to pass through Hoffman Square which is in \ndowntown, Bloemfontein, this area\
  \ is where you will see so many people trying to make their lives better. At every\
  \ street corner there are street vendors selling their products in the hopes of\
  \ bringing money home and feeding their families, so many people are barely making\
  \ it and things don\u2019t seem to becoming any better. I like to see these vendors\
  \ as entrepreneurs who are hard workers like any other billionaires. Each and every\
  \ one of them has a story as to why they are there in the first place. The purpose\
  \ of this story is to clothe them with the honour and dignity they deserve. They\
  \ might be the lower socio-economic groups but to fully appreciate their lives journey\
  \ is see them as individuals. \n\nWhen I got to university I met Ma\u2019 Thabiso\
  \ who sells \u201Csnoekoe le dibeko\u201D (fish and vetcakes) at the local Universitas\
  \ Hospital gate. She sets up her stand at 06:00 am to feed the nurses who are getting\
  \ ready for their first shift or those who just finished their nightshift. Ma\u2019\
  Thabiso like many comes from informal settlements that have to be up by 04:00 am\
  \ to be on time at their stands. She does her job with such excellence and speed\
  \ ensuring that all \nher food is fresh and tasty for her customers. She deserves\
  \ the same respect as the people who work 9-5 jobs. Her life might not be an open\
  \ book but you might not be wrong to assume that she is working to support her grandchildren.\
  \ Next is a young man selling sweets and chips outside the University of the Free\
  \ State. This country is not at all sympathetic to \ncriminals because they affect\
  \ every area of our lives, however, it would not be hard to \nunderstand why people\
  \ choose crime. This young man Sello chose to become a vendor to support his mother\
  \ and siblings. Sello is nothing older than 17 years but he would rather support\
  \ his family than become a criminal. For any tourist walking through these streets,\
  \ take a closer look at the everyday lives of these people in whose country you\
  \ are visiting, your tours don\u2019t have to leave you disgruntled or sorrowful.\
  \ Look beyond just the buildings or our spectacular nature reserves, look at the\
  \ people, and look at their lives not to give \nempathy but to say that you recognise\
  \ them. You see their struggles and leave with gratefulness.\n\nThese incredible\
  \ vendors help us make sense of the world, they too like many could have turned\
  \ to crime but instead opted for something that some might deem degrading. At every\
  \ corner in South Africa, at ever taxi rank there are millions of them who chose\
  \ differently. These unfavourable jobs put food on families tables, these jobs have\
  \ sent young countless dreamers to universities. These people are my local connections;\
  \ they make me a proud \nSouth African."
