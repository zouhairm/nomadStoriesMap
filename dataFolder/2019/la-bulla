Text: "Heaping plates of caracoles\u2014the neighbourhood's namesake\u2014cover the\
  \ tables. They slide, back and forth, on the plastic tablecloth as more tios and\
  \ tias and cousins arrive. Another chair is hauled overhead and plunked down at\
  \ the corner of the table as one more hand reaches in. It's a gridlock of napkins\
  \ and empty plates and baskets of bread and shells and CruzCampos and a big bottle\
  \ of olive oil on the table. The caracoles\u2019 hard shells are soaking in butter:\
  \ spiralled and salty. The snails are a mid-afternoon snack. Early evening snack.\
  \ The space between these times is blurred by the setting sun and the shrill, gleeful\
  \ screams of kids running between and around the parked cars and motorcycles. Life\
  \ is happening outside. \n\nThe city of Seville has almost 700,000 residents. At\
  \ any given moment the streets are packed with honking cars and clunking Sevici\
  \ bicycles. The lone metro line is full of people whose skin sticks to the cream-coloured\
  \ seats in the heat. The orange-paged newspapers shoved by the window are damp.\
  \ They are slick to the touch, like the meat in the caracoles. \n\nThe old city,\
  \ with roads that wind around towering Roman aqueducts, intricate palace walls and\
  \ humongous sycamore trees, slugs forward to keep up with rising modern traffic\
  \ demands. Its zig-zagged mazes of streets and alleyways and patios are no friend\
  \ to the modern four-wheeled mover. \n\nLa Bulla, they call it, turning their palms\
  \ to face the sky and bringing fingertips and thumb together to pinch the air above\
  \ it. La Bulla is the uniquely Sevillano phrase for a uniquely Sevillan crowd. An\
  \ overwhelming crush of people in a surprisingly small place. The ability to shrink\
  \ and shift yourself to fit within the tiny space carved out for you. La Bulla of\
  \ Feria, la Bulla of Semana Santa. Overcrowding does not phase or deter. The city\
  \ and the people and the language wrap and bend themselves around it. There's always\
  \ room for one more around the table and in the room. \n\nMetal legs scrape against\
  \ the cobbled sidewalk; hips and shoulders and arms thrust and shake and squish\
  \ closer to the ones beside them. There's room for one more. Another plate of caracoles\
  \ and another plate of bread and another chair, hefted overhead, plunks down around\
  \ the table. \n\nOutside the restaurant, where people have poured out onto the sidewalk,\
  \ cars are parked. Their noses brush the backs of the chairs squished around the\
  \ table. The chair backs brush the sides of the cars parked perpendicularly behind\
  \ them. La Bulla. Palms to the sky, fingertips to thumbs, always squeezing. \n\n\
  Belen's uncle clamours out of his chair. He pours out onto the sidewalk. His watch\
  \ is tight around his wrist. The children, still running between the tables and\
  \ the cars and the motorcycles, meet his eye. Belen's aunt gets up, her skin squishing\
  \ out between the straps of the sandals that wrap her ankles. She's kissed all the\
  \ cheeks within her reach and blessed all the heads she could palm. She moves to\
  \ the passenger side of her car which faces the now three-tables-long table. Slotted\
  \ between the cars beside it. Boxed in by the black car behind it. La Bulla. The\
  \ oldest children make their way to the back of the perpendicular car and count:\
  \ one, two, three and softly, slowly roll the car forward. Leaving just enough room\
  \ to free up space behind Belen's aunt and uncle's car. Her uncle swings out of\
  \ the spot in reverse, taps the horn and drives off. \n\nThe server comes and clears\
  \ empty plates off the table, making room for another round of caracoles. Hands\
  \ appear and slide dishes and cutlery around the table. Another car pulls up, slides\
  \ into the empty spot. It brushes the backs of the chairs. The cousins walk around\
  \ to the front of the black car, still in neutral. One, two, three, they nudge it\
  \ forward, sealing the new arrivals into their spot. La Bulla. There's always enough\
  \ room for more, food for more, time for more. Life is happening outside and another\
  \ plate of caracoles is delivered to the table."
