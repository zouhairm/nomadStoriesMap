Text: "Yet another place to see. It was the first thing that came to my mind when\
  \ we planned to go to Bangkok to see A Head Full of Dreams by Coldplay. But not\
  \ until I got to explore the city. \nIt was past midnight when we arrived in the\
  \ destination. I can still feel being uncomfortable on the humid night. It was the\
  \ fourth of the year that means one of the hottest months in Thailand. But that\
  \ whisked away by locals who kindly greeted us by \u201CSawadee ka!\u201D. We also\
  \ found ourselves saying this a few many times. We were answered back by their warm\
  \ and welcoming grin. I was in the Land of Smiles afterall.\nWe had a good tuk tuk\
  \ ride to get around the city and visit the famous attractions such as the Grand\
  \ Palace. We had unwound from the streets of art where you can see how people freely\
  \ made it as their canvas as a way of expression. We had visited the night market\
  \ and spent a little amount of money that went a long way. We had partied all night\
  \ and drunk beers and eaten tasty Pad Thai, street foods, and exotic ones like scorpions\
  \ in the crowded place of Khao San road. We had experienced Thai massage that left\
  \ us feeling balanced and relaxed after exhausting all of the above. There is a\
  \ lot of city escape to do and a lot of great options too. \nEvery country is worth\
  \ visiting. But I didn\u2019t expect to find my wanderlust taken to a new level\
  \ after what I had experienced in Thailand. It is not just another place to see\
  \ but also different in a lot of ways. And that made it to my list of favorites:\
  \ the second city where I got to amazingly find out its culture and everything others\
  \ are not."
