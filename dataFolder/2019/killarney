Text: "The weariness was settling into my body.  I had been looking forward to the\
  \ five days ahead in the land my mother believed to be her spiritual homeland. \
  \ My eleven siblings were now in Killarney, and I was on my way to meet them.  They\
  \ arrived four days prior and had begun the tour of Ireland.   I was unable to be\
  \ part of the original family landing party.  The flights out of McAllen, Houston\
  \ and London were uneventful, but a bit tiring.  A steady mild adrenaline rush helped\
  \ me to get through the slow stop-and-go of the screening process at each airport,\
  \ the sitting and waiting in the terminals and the mass of red-eyed travelers standing\
  \ in staccato-moving lines at customs.  The taxi driver whirled me from the airport\
  \ to Heuston Railway Station nearly bouncing off the other cars on the motorway.\
  \  I was told I was fortunate to get what was the last ticket of the day out of\
  \ Dublin on the train to Killarney.  It was a Friday, and many part-time Dubliners\
  \ were heading back to their hometowns for the weekend.  I got on the train and\
  \ settled in for the three-and-a-half-hour ride.   A young, well-groomed gentleman\
  \ sat next to me on the train and asked me about my boots.  \u201CThey be some mighty\
  \ fine-looking boots ya got on there.  Where ya from?\u201D  I told him I was coming\
  \ from Texas, and he told me he should have guessed.  \u201CCertainly then. That\u2019\
  s why ya got the almost-matching hat.\u201D  I wasn\u2019t sure if he was making\
  \ fun of me, but he seemed to really like my fedora.  To get the attention off of\
  \ me, I asked him where he was from.  \u201CPort Laois.  I got me wee one waiting\
  \ on me there.  I work in Dublin for the Irish Independent, but I get home to see\
  \ \u2018im every Friday night.  Some of me pals like to have a good time, and so\
  \ would I, on these Fridays, but I\u2019m headin\u2019 home to see Patrick.\u201D\
  \  I was starting to like this guy because of the ease with which he spoke to me\
  \ and the friendliness he appeared to be showing a foreigner.  He told me about\
  \ his job as a copy editor and about different headlines lately.  I explained that\
  \ I was meeting up with my family in Killarney and then traveling around the republic,\
  \ a tribute to our mother who felt deeply Irish, although she lived in the Midwest\
  \ her entire life.  He congratulated me on having a wonderful family.  Although\
  \ I was a little sorry to see him off at the Port Laois station, I was ready to\
  \ let my guard down and relax before arriving to Killarney.  Over the next few stops,\
  \ passengers mostly disembarked.  A few came on the train, though.  A mother with\
  \ two small children boarded in Templemore.  She was wearing a drab, but clean long\
  \ skirt and white frilly blouse.  A green wool shawl hung loosely on her shoulders.\
  \  Her small boys both wore blue jeans and navy blue sweaters.  She nodded to all\
  \ of us in the car and then quietly sat down with her children tightly in tow. \
  \ In Thurles, an elderly gentleman wearing a brown tweed sports jacket boarded the\
  \ train.  \u201CEv\u2019nin\u2019 to you,\u201D he said aloud for all, but only\
  \ one person responded.  \u201CA fine evening to you, sir,\u201D said a middle-aged\
  \ man wearing laborer's clothes - blue jeans, work boots, a frayed blue coat.  He\
  \ wore a brown Irish cap.  His face was full of wrinkles coming from his eyes and\
  \ deep furrows on his brow.  The train car lurched forward, and we continued on\
  \ our journey.  The smooth ride and the rhythmic clicking on the tracks soon made\
  \ my body fell it was about to render itself to the sublime state of relaxation.\
  \  I imagined what Killarney would look like, how it would be to greet my brothers\
  \ and sisters and their families, how a Guinness would taste at a downtown pub.\
  \  The fatigue settling into my body felt good, and with a little relaxation, I\
  \ knew I would be ready to spend the evening pub crawling with kin although it would\
  \ be around midnight when I arrived."
