Text: "Have you ever paid for a taxi to the airport with rum?\nIt\u2019s refreshing.\
  \ Both the method and the rum. A sweet Havana Club\_A\xF1ejo\_7 exchanged for a\
  \ toothy driver, some good chat and a lift to Cuba\u2019s international airport\
  \ at 4am in the morning.\nYou see, we ran out of money. Well, not exactly ran out,\
  \ but we deadset could not find it. My suspicions lie with the flower boy who came\
  \ by our window daily with his bright smile and freshly picked Jasmines. We always\
  \ bought a bunch (they were like the price of bubble gum) for our host mum, and\
  \ I reckon the little weasel snuck his way in an looted our secret hiding spot.\
  \ When I say \u201Csecret\u201D I mean under the mattress and \"looted\u201D is\
  \ probably a bit far for stealing like our remaining $7. \nOur driver, who met us\
  \ on our street at our casa, completely understood the situation. We pitched the\
  \ high brow rum in exchange for a lift and a couple of nods later we trundled off\
  \ in his red Ford, black clouds billowing behind us from the exhaust. Our new friend,\
  \ a rotund man named Carlos of indiscriminate age, wore a blue polo and dark jeans\
  \ with sandals, a Cuban through and through. Between sips of his new reward, he\
  \ shared some anecdotes with us as we hurtled towards the only airport in the world\
  \ which doesn\u2019t have uniformed security personnell. A Classic Cuban touch,\
  \ but should I have really been surprised? This country had delivered beyond promises\
  \ of being a ruthlessly unapologetic and genuine community of people, with the finest\
  \ cars and most elegant dance moves.\nCarlos told us about a time when Havana used\
  \ to be much more. A glint in his eye betrayed his longing for times past and his\
  \ voice oozed with nostalgia, even though I could only understand half of what he\
  \ was saying. \nHe\u2019d get excited and stop half way through one story and leap\
  \ into the next, like a rabbit in snow, hopping from mound to mound, keen to explore\
  \  every new bump. My friend Cat was leading the conversation as my Spanish was\
  \ minimal, but I almost enjoyed the theatre of his gestures more than the substance\
  \ of his tales.\nSuddenly his eyes got big. He reached a crescendo with his story\
  \ and took in a sharp intake of breath and let out a little howl. It bounced around\
  \ the car and our friend wound down his window and howled again. Louder.\nWe could\
  \ see it now. The supermoon, promised to us nights ago, had finally come out of\
  \ hiding from behind the clouds and nestled gently in the sky, hanging like a pumpkin\
  \ above the horizon.\nCarlos pulled over and hurried outside to get a better look.\
  \ In other circumstances I would\u2019ve felt unsafe but this was just a man who\
  \ was a little too excited by celestial events and who am I to stop him?\nCat and\
  \ I scrambled outside as well and we all stood, calm, silent and eyes cast to the\
  \ shining orb, moonlight dancing in front of us with an eerily inviting glaze. The\
  \ radiant light was dazzling with a melancholy feel, but I felt a wave of serenity\
  \ and accomplishment in its hazy beams.\nI don\u2019t know how long we stood there\
  \ but it was cool. Just cool. Carlos passed around the bottle and we shared a cheeky\
  \ sip with our driver, who as quickly as he erupted in glee, leapt back into the\
  \ car and motioned for us to get in. Oh yeah, we had a flight to catch.\nHe unloaded\
  \ our suitcases and gave us a wave goodbye as he sped off with one last howl. Cat\
  \ and I exchanged looks and trudged in to an empty airport with no one at security\
  \ and a particularly chubby and sleepy man who was either a cleaner or an airline\
  \ official but it was hard to tell.\nWho needs change when you have rum, right?\
  \ That has been, by far, my favourite way to pay for taxis since."
