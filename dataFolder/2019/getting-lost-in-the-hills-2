Text: "That was a time when i was giving my 2nd year exams and was really frustrated.\
  \ I took a day off and started scrolling for the places which i can visit on my\
  \ holidays. I came up with a place called dehradoon which is situated in uttrakhand\
  \ state. Dehradoon is also called the city of love. And i can truely believe that\
  \ why it is called so. After my exams where over, without wasting any time booked\
  \ my tickes for the train and went there. After reaching there i went to my maternal\
  \ aunty\u2019s home. After resting for a day i took my bike and went to see the\
  \ city. The city is surely beautiful. At every place we can find a small shops which\
  \ sells bun tikki ( an item made of a bun, a patty, and some kind of indian sauce\
  \ named as green chutney and curd). That food item is really famous and is delicious\
  \ too. Without wasting any time i went to see the queen of hills that is mussoorie.\
  \ That city is 30 km ahead of dehradoon. The roads will surely give you pleasure\
  \ when you will ride your vehicals on that just smooth big and curvy roads. There\
  \ is a famous road called mall road there where you can do your shopping stuffs\
  \ of can enjoy food and liqour. As moving to the heights a place will come called\
  \ kemty falls which 13 km from mussoorie. That water fall will surely give you chills\
  \ because of the purity of the environment. At various places from mussoorie diversion\
  \ road to the kemty falls one can find many maggie points( a noodles shop). The\
  \ way they make it makes it different from the rest. After returning back at the\
  \ evening i rested at my aunt\u2019s home and planned what im gonna do the next\
  \ day. I called one of my friend who was living in the city. I asked him that what\
  \ else is famous here so he asked me to join him as he and his friends were going\
  \ to see some places which were not known by every one. The other day as i reached\
  \ at my friend\u2019s home he greeted me well and in return i did that too. The\
  \ journey started to see the hidden places. One of them was shikhar falls. That\
  \ is place which is there inside the hills and only a person who knows the city\
  \ well can take you there. That place was quit and decent. Surely to chill and relax.\
  \ I loved that place. After returning back in the afternoon i rested at my aunt\u2019\
  s home and in the evening went to the pacific mall which is one the finest mall\
  \ of dehradoon. There i do some shopping and enjoyed the food at KFC. My trip was\
  \ only of 2 days so i was not able to see many other hidden places but when i will\
  \ visit it again, i will definetly gonna see everything"
