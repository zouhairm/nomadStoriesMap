Text: "Connecting with new world was always my dream. I always try to jump into new\
  \ places around me,collect views of new and fresh minds. I live in yoga capital\
  \ of world and many countries are connected with us.  I have many friends from all\
  \ around the world and i have joined them.  My best mate is from U.S Paul he was\
  \ the craziest and ambitious men i ever met in my whole life we traveled around\
  \ rishikesh and many other palces i showed him the hidden world in rishikesh which\
  \ was known to few. Although i was not that good in taking  pictures but that day\
  \ was a kind of luck for me i took some wonderful photographs and he was happy then\
  \ we both went to a place which is around 324 km away from \n rishikesh ,Chopta\
  \ the king of mountains in local speaking.  I was there for first time we both enjoyed\
  \ there it was 6 am in morning when we started to climb in winter's. We both were\
  \ packed in clothes but those were not enough we started shivering  and the we gained\
  \ some courage with the sip of local tea and a bonfire with it. And started our\
  \ climb to the next level mountain it was a challenge for Paul as he was not familiar\
  \ with mountains. There i came rescuing him with the local teqniques of climbing.\
  \  After 2 hours we reaced our destination and it was a wonder for both of us we\
  \ enjoyed there and visted the local temple followed by our dinner .next day we\
  \ started for my home it was a good experience for both of us."
