Text: "\"What have I gotten myself into?\" I thought quietly to myself- a thought\
  \ not unfamiliar to the first-time-solo-traveler. Doubts about the upcoming months\
  \ began to drip steadily until there was a puddle of dread spreading in my mind.\
  \ \"Take a deep breath.\" \nIt was a cool, unusually clear and dry (for Ireland)\
  \ night in the onset of autumn when I landed in Shannon. My muscles throbbed and\
  \ my ankles were swollen after an excruciating seventeen-hour travel day. My belongings\
  \ packed tightly in my backpack, which once rested lightly on my shoulders, now\
  \ weighed me down. \n     My destination: Limerick. I would be living and studying\
  \ at the University of Limerick for a semester as part of a study abroad program\
  \ through my home university. I had heard little of Limerick before accepting, but\
  \ the school had a respectable English program, and the city of Limerick appeared\
  \ charming from the pictures. \n     To ease me into my stay at UL, the university\
  \ had kindly booked a taxi to arrive as my plane landed and take me to my accommodation\
  \ on campus. However, my plane had arrived late. I looked at my watch: 11:00pm.\
  \ I was supposed to land an hour ago. I tapped my foot anxiously, but it wasn\u2019\
  t making the line for customs move any faster. \"Great\" I thought, \"the taxi probably\
  \ left.\"\n     Once I had performed my rehearsed script to the immigration officer\
  \ like a pro (\"I\u2019m studying at University of Limerick. Yes, 3 months. Here\u2019\
  s my letter of approval\u2026.\"), I was one of the few left in the dingy airport.\
  \ I looked around. No one was waiting for me. More dread. I peaked outside just\
  \ to be sure, but when I didn\u2019t see any taxis I knew my fear was confirmed.\
  \ Now what? It was too late for the buses. I could call a taxi... I found the nearest\
  \ bench and propped my feet up while I scanned my brain for solutions. \n     I\
  \ was not a total newbie to travelling; I had travelled before with my family, but\
  \ this was my first glimpse into the life of a solo traveller. I had not yet acquired\
  \ the problem-solving skills and ease of navigating a foreign country that solo-traveler-veterans\
  \ acquire. I wondered at what point it became easier. Maybe never. \n     \u201C\
  At least you won\u2019t have to deal with language barriers\u201D flitted through\
  \ my head. My sister offered me these words of encouragement days before my departure.\
  \ I nodded in agreement. (Although, if you\u2019ve ever been introduced to Irish\
  \ slang you know this is far from true.)\n\u201CMiss Thorp?\u201D My head shot up.\
  \ \u201CYer Miss Thorp, aren\u2019t ye?\u201D The man had greying hair and wrinkles\
  \ framing his grey-blue eyes. His voice was gruff, but his face was kind. I nodded.\
  \ \u201CThe name\u2019s Joel. Aye\u2019m yer taxi driver,\u201D I let out a sigh\
  \ of relief, \u201Caye was waitin fer an hour an was about to leave but I din want\
  \ ye stranded here alone.\u201D \n     I opened up the passenger door and was taken\
  \ aback when the steering wheel was on the wrong side of the car. Oh, right. We\
  \ made small talk during the 20-kilometer drive. Joel\u2019s thick Irish accent\
  \ was difficult for my ears, and I found myself straining to pick out words I could\
  \ understand. The conversation trickled slowly at first, but within a few minutes\
  \ I found myself at ease and able to open up. He shared stories about his children\
  \ with me, he told me about common Irish phrases (\u201Cwhat\u2019s the craic?\u201D\
  ), and he gave me a list of his favorite pubs in Limerick. His charisma and kindness\
  \ were authentic and sincere; my muscles began to relax for the first time since\
  \ I stepped off the plane. \n     When the taxi finally pulled up next to my campus\
  \ accommodation it was nearly midnight. I was exhausted, but the dread that filled\
  \ me an hour before was now replaced with confidence. I thanked Joel as I gathered\
  \ my bags. \u201CWelcome to Ireland,\u201D he smiled, \u201Cenjoy every second of\
  \ it.\u201D He drove off. I walked up the gravel path with all my belongings on\
  \ my back. My backpack no longer dragged me down the way it did before. \"I got\
  \ this.\""
