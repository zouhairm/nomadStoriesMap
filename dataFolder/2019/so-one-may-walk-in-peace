Text: "So One May Walk in Peace - Traversing Martial Arts, Midlife and Matriarchy\
  \ on the Camino de Santiago.\n\nLife is a journey. We each choose our own path and\
  \ these choices create our future. Every twist, turn, and miraculous detour has\
  \ its purpose. \n\nAs a near 40 year-old female martial artist, and executive professional\
  \ with no children of her own, on the cusp of 40,  walking the Camino de Santiago\
  \ has been on my bucket list for many years.  Whether it is the love affair within\
  \ my own heart,  the energy and warmth of Portugal and all her vibrancy, or the\
  \ seeker of inspired truths from those that walked before me,  there is a beautiful\
  \ story waiting to be shared through the footsteps of any woman willing to shed\
  \ expectation and walk her own \"Way\" (the nickname for the Camino).  \n\nI see\
  \ this potential scholarship as a chance to re-invigorate my passion for writing\
  \ as well as spark the next phase of my own artistic journey as a writer.  I've\
  \ had many opportunities over the years to connect with and find audience through\
  \ my love of writing based entirely on the inspired learnings from my own travel\
  \ and lived experiences.  \n\nThe incredible chance to work with a mentor and cultivate\
  \ my own writing style while studying Portugal seems like a breathtaking opportunity.\
  \   To me, the greatest opportunity for self growth often comes with self-reflection\
  \ as mirrored against our environment.  And with that humbling observations that\
  \ make writing an opportunity really to narrate the landscape of our own experiences\
  \ so that it may find resonance with others.  \n\nI see this scholarship opportunity\
  \ as a chance to reflect on my experiences, my surroundings as well as my own passions.\
  \  But more importantly, share in those same truths with others.  The best part\
  \ of any journey really is the faces and places you meet along the way - and truly\
  \ see this all as one of the most epic adventure and expression of art as much as\
  \ life while also traversing the rich history and landscape of Portugal.  \n\nUsing\
  \ the page as a means for which to harness experience through the sharing of honest\
  \ and vulnerable truths in order to inspire related experiences through the written\
  \ word.\n\nLife is but an odyssey.  \n\nThank you in advance for your consideration.\
  \  And hope to hear from you in the near future."
