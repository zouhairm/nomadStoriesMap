Text: "What\u2019s life without a little adventure? I\u2019ve always wanted to travel,\
  \ but like many, I always found an excuse not too. It was too expensive; I had no\
  \ vacation time; who would go with me? \n\nUntil one day I decided no more excuses!\
  \ Life is too short to have missed opportunities; missed adventures. So I did want\
  \ any sane person would do. I got a job teaching English and brought a one way ticket\
  \ to Thailand! I had to go now! So I quit my U.S. job and took a step into the unknown.\
  \ Now don\u2019t get me wrong I was terrified, but I was determined to go. So I\
  \ went shaking and all. \n\nWhen I finally arrived to my city 8 hours south of Bangkok,\
  \ I immediately felt like I was in a different world. Everything fascinated me;\
  \ the buildings, the language, and the food. I was awestruck. My first night, I\
  \ hit the streets to taste some amazing food.  Since I did not speak Thai, I pointed\
  \ and hoped for the best. I can honestly say I never had a bad dish in Thailand.\
  \ \n\nAs time went on, I slowly transitioned from feeling like a tourist to feeling\
  \ apart of the community. I truly felt welcomed. It was in Thailand where I learned\
  \ how to let go. So much of my life I tried to force a future. In Thailand I simply\
  \ lived in the present. I learned to be comfortable in any situation. \n\nWheather\
  \ you\u2019re taking a short trip or a longer one, a local trip, or an international\
  \ one, traveling can transform you. You just have to be willing. \n\nI\u2019m glad\
  \ I took that leap. I am not the same person anymore. Will you take the leap into\
  \ the unknown?"
