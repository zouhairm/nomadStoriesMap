Text: "Nothing had been getting through to her. Ara had been half-alive, her mind\
  \ reduced to its physical grey matter. Nothing had mattered. She had spent weeks\
  \ beached on a couch in her flat, eyes staring at the ceiling, glass of wine in\
  \ hand. \n\n\u201CAra, you gotta get out more.\u201D\n\u201CAra, I\u2019m going\
  \ to see Henry, do you want to come?\u201D \n\u201CAra, this is getting ridiculous.\
  \ Let me help you see someone.\u201D \n- can\u2019t you see I\u2019m trying?\n\n\
  Her flat-mates had begged and nagged and pushed her until she\u2019d wound up on\
  \ a different couch \u2013 this one belonging to the university therapist. On the\
  \ wall had been a poster, stating \u201CAchieve, Reach, Dream\u201D in spirally\
  \ letters. Ara hadn\u2019t felt like doing any of those things, but the therapist\
  \ had helped her talk a little. And little by little a thread of motivation had\
  \ wound its way inside of her, until she\u2019d let her parents persuade her into\
  \ an all-expenses paid trip to a surprise location. A trip designed to \u2018bring\
  \ back her spark.\u2019 \n\n\u201CTokyo?! You\u2019re so lucky! I want to go to\
  \ Tokyo sooooo bad. Bring me a postcard!\u201D\nHer flat mates had been rapt to\
  \ see her going somewhere other than the bathroom.\n- thrilled to see me gone.\n\
  \nAnd now here she was. Standing in different air, under the same sky. Alone.\n\n\
  Her film camera was around her neck. The ground was cobbled \u2013 this little side\
  \ street off Harajuku where the houses ranged in color and vending machines lined\
  \ the walls. It was cold. She noticed a green railing next to a sloping ramp, little\
  \ steps on the other side of it. An old man with a puffer jacket and a bicycle was\
  \ leaning against it. She noted that he was in excellent shape. In fact, every old\
  \ person she\u2019d seen was in excellent shape. Interesting. \nI wish my life was\
  \ as interesting as this place.\n\nHer mind was still devoid of emotion, her brain\
  \ reluctant to release serotonin or dopamine or whatever else her wellbeing required.\
  \ But at least her surroundings were aesthetic. The group of girls walking past\
  \ were dressed amazingly. All of them wore spiky platforms, flowy skirts, and bomber\
  \ jackets. They were chattering in Japanese, their voices cutting across each other\
  \ with laughter.  They looked about fourteen and she could sense their enthusiasm\
  \ for life. She suddenly felt acutely aware of her foreignness, her loneliness.\
  \ Here she was, in a strange country, where she understood nobody and fit in naught.\
  \ In fact, until she spoke \u2013 her New Zealand accent thick on her tongue \u2013\
  \ she could have passed for a local. But inside she knew the truth. \n\n- isolation.\n\
  No different to her everyday isolation, but also different in every way. Now, she\
  \ was walking on a main road and about a million people spilled out in front of\
  \ her. Now, she was lost amidst the sea of faces \u2013 for once like hers \u2013\
  \ and she could hear classical music attempting to overlay the bustle with elegance.\
  \ Bodies brushed against hers, pressing warmth into her frigid legs, and she found\
  \ herself staring with fascination at a very pampered chihuahua in a pram. \n\n\
  It was interesting to see scenes she\u2019d only ever read about or seen on screen.\
  \ But Harajuku was real, and she was in it. \n\nShe saw an old woman dressed as\
  \ an anime character, her face painted, her clothes bright. And Ara felt a stirring\
  \ within her \u2013 a feeling: shit, I want to photograph her. But that would mean\
  \ talking to her \u2013 a stranger \u2013 something Ara hadn\u2019t done for a long\
  \ time. But her fingers were already moving, her artist eye was taking stock of\
  \ the light. She approached slowly, warily, holding up her camera in question. It\
  \ felt like hunting, and maybe her prey was something more than just an image. \n\
  \nLater, as she reviewed the photographs \u2013 reflexively smiling at the lady\u2019\
  s cheesy poses \u2013 she felt something happening inside her brain. The excitement\
  \ of the new place, the new people, the photographic proof of her social competency\
  \ \u2013 they were all connecting something lost in her mind. The connections in\
  \ her brain were working, and Ara actually felt happy."
