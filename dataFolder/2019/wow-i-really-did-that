Text: "Wow, I really did that?\n\nAs I embarked on my first solo venture in my 21\
  \ years, I was filled with anticipation. Part of me was rife with excitement, the\
  \ other sick with nervous thoughts. But one thing is for sure \u2013 I was certain\
  \ I was going to come home a different person. Looking back, these pre-conceived\
  \ notions of travelling are somewhat funny to me. Did I grow as a person as I had\
  \ initially thought? \n\nI have come to realise that I have a weird relationship\
  \ with new experiences. A lot of the time, it seems, I feel more personal satisfaction\
  \ planning a trip, and then reflecting once it\u2019s over, than I do when I\u2019\
  m actually living it. This was a personal trait I noticed about myself pretty early\
  \ on, and one that has stuck with me now that I have returned home. \n\nWhile travelling,\
  \ I have always been super honest about how lucky I am to have had these experiences.\
  \ Bear in mind, I\u2019ve worked hard, but I have always acknowledged that many\
  \ people no matter how hard they work never get to travel as much as they like.\
  \ However, despite how lucky I felt at almost every moment of my travels, I never\
  \ felt content, and I\u2019ve never truly put my finger on why that was. \n\nBefore\
  \ I left home, I spent every waking moment planning, researching, reading up on\
  \ how, where and when to travel. I watched travel documentaries religiously until\
  \ I felt like I could be the tour guide myself, and when I left the country, this\
  \ didn\u2019t change. I was obsessed. With every trip I took, part of me was already\
  \ ready to live the next one. I would plan new trips while I was living some once\
  \ in a lifetime experiences, and although it partially added to the excitement,\
  \ it bothered me. Why could I not just enjoy the trip I was in? Why was I always\
  \ looking for the next adventure? \n\nI\u2019ve come to realise that my desire to\
  \ always be looking forward was a symptom of dealing with the discomfort of being\
  \ truly alone on the other side of the world. Despite all the preparations I thought\
  \ I had done, nothing really prepares for the loneliness, the culture shock or the\
  \ second thoughts you have when you really put yourself out of your comfort zone.\
  \ It followed me through my wildest adventures, and this was something I did not\
  \ expect to cope with. To counter these feelings, I was determined to make it look\
  \ like I was having the best time to my friends back home. My heart reminded me\
  \ that these experiences were ones I would cherish forever, where my head was longing\
  \ for stability. \n\nMaybe you never are truly content travelling the world. Maybe\
  \ there will always be a feeling of uncertainty on the road. But those feelings\
  \ are why I went in the first place. Now that I\u2019m back in New Zealand and fully\
  \ settled back into mundane routine, I look back on my experiences in awe. My time\
  \ abroad was an experience that changed me in more ways than I expected, although\
  \ it was the times that pushed me emotionally, where I questioned my decision to\
  \ leave that I found the most valuable. \n\nSometimes the most rewarding feelings\
  \ come from experiences you never expect, and for me it was just that I was out\
  \ there doing it. Before I left home, I thought leaving would change me in so many\
  \ visible ways, but the fact I am happy, healthy and alive after so many new experiences\
  \ out of my comfort zone is validation enough for me. Until I spread my wings again,\
  \ I can happily look back on every one of my crazy escapades and think, \u201Cwow,\
  \ I really did that?\u201D."
