Text: "My brother, seemingly high on coca tea and thin air, enters a stone building\
  \ in the lost city of the Incas with the careful, focused steps of an archeologist.\
  \ Here is the tomb; find your gold. I look across the emerald grass, watch neighboring\
  \ Huayna Picchu play hide and seek with smoked-glass clouds, and from the corner\
  \ of my eye I catch not just my brother\u2019s shadow inside an ancient stone building,\
  \ but also a follower, one with different exploratory intentions. I open my mouth\
  \ to warn him, but it\u2019s too late. They\u2019re both completely out of sight,\
  \ isolated amidst the sky, the mountains, and looming architectural wonders cutting\
  \ off any connection to the modern world.   \n\nBack in the states, I grew up in\
  \ a rural (arguably suburban) New England town. Colonial houses. Cemeteries with\
  \ worn out headstones. People who had never left. And of course, those that had\
  \ only to be drawn back for some inexplicable reason. That was my world. Down the\
  \ street, past the telephone pole my parents once spray-painted PARTY! with an arrow\
  \ (which the post-firework police officers did not find amusing) was something a\
  \ little different than the typical Connecticut landscape: an alpaca farm.  \n\n\
  Alpacas resemble a successful cross between a deer and a sheep. They\u2019re smaller\
  \ than llamas, fuzzy; they communicate through body language, and aren\u2019t bred\
  \ to be working animals. In these parts it\u2019s all about sheering and chill.\
  \  \n\nIn the summer, my brother and I would walk the half-mile from our parents\u2019\
  \ house, texting a third adventurer on our respective flip phones that didn\u2019\
  t support group messaging. Each text was marked with an * at the beginning, indicating\
  \ it was being sent to not one, but all of us. In this tedious, yet intuitive manner\
  \ we talked about Peruvian gold, snakes, and dilapidated ruins; of running through\
  \ the jungle with ancient artifacts tucked beneath our arms while the bad guys were\
  \ just behind us, guns blazing. Then one of the alpacas would make a noise, snort\
  \ in what we could only assume was laughter at our wildly ambitious treasure hunting\
  \ plans.  \n\nTwo years later, cradled in the arms of the Andes, I\u2019m surrounded\
  \ by alpacas. Each one is constantly chewing mouthfuls of grass green enough to\
  \ be transplanted straight from Ireland. Here, among stones and stairs that predate\
  \ the signing of the Declaration of Independence by over three hundred years, these\
  \ exquisitely curious animals are tasked with grazing the high fields of the Incan\
  \ Citadel.  \n\n\u201CWe can\u2019t bring lawn mowers up here,\u201D our guide tells\
  \ us. He\u2019s a relaxed, organized man who wants to travel to Brazil next year\
  \ for a soccer game. \u201CSo they keep everything neat and clean.\u201D  \n\n As\
  \ the sun arches across the sky and illuminates the gorgeous South American mountains,\
  \ we, both the animals and ourselves, become a little more comfortable around one\
  \ another.\n\nI take a couple pictures of the building my brother and his stalker\
  \ disappeared into. The shadows inside move, and I hold down the shutter-release\
  \ as he comes out, his expression one of alarm. Right behind him, with an almost\
  \ gleeful look on its face, is the beige and white alpaca that followed him inside.\
  \  \n\nWe laugh at the absurdity of it. Several people glance in our direction,\
  \ willing us to appreciate the serene quiet. Slowly, we settle against boulders\
  \ a little closer to our new friend and watch as it takes a massive bite out of\
  \ the grass. When it looks back up it snorts and we can\u2019t help it. Our cross-species\
  \ laughter echoes across into the valley down below."
