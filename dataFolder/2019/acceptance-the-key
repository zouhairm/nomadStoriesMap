Text: "As romantic Rome sounds, it sounds pretty different with a 2 year old ! \n\
  Yes indeed this journey began with its regular dose of excitement of fulfilling\
  \ an eternal dream - The Italian adventure. This was soon to be quelled by the exhausting\
  \ journey. Not just because it was long and tiring, but it was long, tiring and\
  \ well with a trying & irritant 2 year old. \nAs she sat down on the aisle sucking\
  \ the energy & excitement out of me- I pondered over the definition of motherhood\
  \ and wondered what it was all about?\nWhat I didn\u2019t expect to find was a bag\
  \ full of No\u2019s \u2013 no respite, no relaxes, no recoup, no rejuvenation! \
  \ \nAnd a lot many No\u2019s to follow.\nBottom-line \u201CA Mother is NEVER on\
  \ a VACATION\u201D (BOLD, CAPS & Underlined).\nI met my better half at the Fiumicino\
  \ airport with no hugs, no kisses but complaints galore of the gruesome 20 hour\
  \ journey with our Bundle of misbehaving Joy, throwing her tantrums in the air,\
  \ and of-course our 8 course luggage + a pram. Traveling light!\nSoon my love for\
  \ cobbled pathways would give way to the struggles of maneuvering a buggy.  My dreams\
  \ of sitting by the sidewalk in charming caf\xE9s sipping the aromatic brew would\
  \ turn into a frantic hunt for restrooms for a quick change for my baby.\nBetween\
  \ pukes, poops and burps she was obedient, once in awhile, joyfully sitting on her\
  \ throne clenching tightly as we raced to catch the next train pushing her through\
  \ the undulating pathway, bobbing her head with each bump, not complaining but somehow\
  \ enjoying the uncomfortable ride.\nTraveling with a child has it perks too - VIP\
  \ privilege entry for toddlers at airports n some monuments.\nHowever, Coliseum\
  \ did not feature in the list. Touring the historical heart of Rome the Coliseum\
  \ seemed a bit too colossal, after an hour\u2019s wait and making few friends in\
  \ the queue, we finally managed to get inside. A few steps into the grand architectural\
  \ splendor a comedy of errors awaited us- while I stopped to admire its magnitude,\
  \ my better half chose to move ahead and altogether exited the building with the\
  \ crowd and our 2 year old.\nA couple of rounds of the perfectly concentric oval\
  \ were I peek-a-booed at every curve expecting to run into them; at last I met my\
  \ American friends who had seen them at the exit. Fuming! I raced to the exit only\
  \ to find the dejected souls being refused reentry. My Indian ingenuity kicked in\
  \ here. I took to the lost and found kiosk. A few teary announcements later we were\
  \ able to persuade a kind guard to let them in.\nOne might wonder how in this age\
  \ of communication, we managed to \u201CGet Lost\u201D but we successfully achieved\
  \ to do so. This was indeed the first of the many lost and found to follow. \nThankfully,\
  \ Roman Forum and Palatine hill were less eventful (personally, not historically)\
  \ other than the difficulty of lugging a baby, a backpack, and a buggy simultaneously.\n\
  Over the next few days we slowed our pace and relaxed - walked and walked through\
  \ the by lanes discovering the unconventional puppet dance and music shows, Italian\
  \ artists with their masterpieces, beautiful plazas with their gurgling fountains.\
  \ \nWe gasped at the glory of Venice, an astounding city defying time and soaked\
  \ in the Florentine drizzle - enjoying live band by the night and the divine cello\
  \ by The Duomo, trotted through the intricate streets of Naples beautifully ornate\
  \ with Easter warmth and even warmer gentry. \nMy Italian adventure did have a few\
  \ sore thumbs but the experience was classic. We didn\u2019t touch and go each spot\
  \ but soaked in the master piece called Italy. No more was it essential to do it\
  \ all and see it all but experience the surreal trance of our reunion in a foreign\
  \ fantasy. A sudden calmness transcended upon me; acceptance was the key. \n\u201C\
  Aham Brahmasmi\u201D (\u2018I am the Creator\u2019 - at least of my turmoil)!\n\
  The rigors of the journey resides in its tale and a tale without adventure fades\
  \ away in memory.\nWell this tale shall certainly not be one of them!"
