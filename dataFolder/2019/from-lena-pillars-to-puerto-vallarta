Text: "When I saw this Scholarship I thought \"finally I can speak out on that point\"\
  . I just want as many people as possible to hear my idea and perhaps somebody will\
  \ change its style of traveling and will like it.\nI cannot say that I have a big\
  \ life experience, but in my 23 years, life taught me an important thing: if you\
  \ see cheap tickets, buy it right now, and it does not matter when this travel will\
  \ be, it does not matter if you have a visa, it does not matter even wherever these\
  \ tickets are. I do not spend big money on travel. Try to understand me, it is not\
  \ because I grudge spending money on it, no. I know a lot of people who plan carefully\
  \ their travels and spend all the resources for comfort. You know in my country\
  \ it is a very popular \"package tour\", and even if they decide to organize travel\
  \ by themselves, anyway in their blogs and Instagram you could see \"in Milan I\
  \ advise you to visit this very expensive restaurant, there are good breakfast,\
  \ lunch, brunch etc.\" Well, I know the word \"brunch\" just because of Blair Waldorf.\n\
  My friend says \"it is even better out of sightseeing\". So this is Rule Number\
  \ One of all my travels: to book a hostel when you are already in town and not in\
  \ touristic place and not to search a place to eat in TripAdvisor but ask locals\
  \ or find a market uptown. I have no idea how does it work but all my adventures\
  \ happened when I was limited in resources: in Mexico we slept on the beach under\
  \ the sound of the Pacific Ocean because of our car broke down and we had no money\
  \ to rent a hostel, in the morning I realized that I did not have one sandal (it\
  \ was stolen by dogs who ran around); in Lisbon I have met the Russian refugee who\
  \ wrote a book about European women and on motorbike he drove me to the ocean; in\
  \ Milan I found the best pizza place ever for 1.50 and actually it was the best\
  \ one in all my life, I have lost in Tallinn but found my apartment at night and\
  \ I was the happiest person in the world when I finally could sleep; in Baikal I\
  \ knew group of tourists who offered me to participate in shamanic ceremony and\
  \ drink Kumis. \nI have this kind of stories and amazing memories in every country\
  \ have I ever visited, and the main rule I try to keep is not to be afraid of life.\
  \ Because the best things ever happened to you could be real only if you leave the\
  \ comfort zone."
