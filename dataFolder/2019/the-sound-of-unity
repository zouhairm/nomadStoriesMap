Text: "The sound of unity\u2026\n\n \nWhose alarm cry that much? I shouted on my roommates,\
  \ one of them said \u201Chay wake up girl, don\u2019t you go to the hike? Oh, no\
  \ I can\u2019t miss the chance. Jump and ran just like a rocket. It was a holiday\
  \ for the university. That\u2019s why we decided to go somewhere. The destination\
  \ was a waterfall. There were around twenty boys and fifteen girls. We caught a\
  \ bus to Kandy and then got in to a mathale bus.\n                             It\
  \ took around two hours to reach to the place. Started the walking through a small\
  \ old path. The houses surround was built by clay & stones. They didn\u2019t have\
  \ proper roofs. Poverty was the eye-caching thing of that area. But the children\
  \ had smiling faces, they showed us how much they enjoy their childhood with their\
  \ joyful games. The climate became more comfortable and could see the Kotagaga fall\
  \ far away from us. The scenery of the waterfall could make us fast and we passed\
  \ a little forest. The special thing of this waterfall was it has seven separate\
  \ falls in different levels. \n                                    The first fall\
  \ was not much big one. We crossed it to go up to the fall. Yeh we were climbing\
  \ up to the waterfall.to cross the waterfall everybody should be wet by the fall.\
  \ To meet the second fall we didn\u2019t take much time but the way to the second\
  \ fall was nice. We could swim under a little cave to cross the path. There were\
  \ mosses on rocks.it could make my mind to draw some of them. The path was fill\
  \ of bamboo trees and all most all trees were with mosses. When one leg wants to\
  \ go front other leg comes back.it was slippery and we got support from the branches\
  \ surround the path. \n                                            We came near\
  \ to the third fall.it was the widest fall of the kotaganga fall. Suddenly the water\
  \ level goes up and we could not even go near to the fall, as it was dangerous.\
  \ We waited around twenty minutes. But it didn\u2019t seem go back to the earlier\
  \ water level. Most of My friends were worried, as she was afraid of that situation.\
  \ But some of us really wanted to cross the fall as if we couldn\u2019t cross should\
  \ forget about the other four waterfalls. The decision was critical and eventually\
  \ we wanted to do it.\n                                    One boy tied the rope\
  \ around his waist and carefully crossed the fall. There was not any basal to hang\
  \ the rope in that side. Then other boys also tied in to the rope & supported us\
  \ to cross the fall. It was all about the balance and trust.my could hear my heart\
  \ beat even with the sound of water. The little movement, mistake could change the\
  \ chapter of us. That is the best experience of my life which I experienced the\
  \ real adventure. Trust showed us the path to achieve.\n/Users/newuser/Documents/IMG_3479.JPG"
