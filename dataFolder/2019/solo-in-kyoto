Text: "It is not in many moments in life that we find ourselves completely out of\
  \ our comfort zone yet here I was about to board a solo flight to Kyoto. What was\
  \ meant to be a grand gesture of love, ended up being a story of self-discovery\
  \ and unleashed my wanderlust for global travel. My mission was simple, explore\
  \ as much of this fascinating country as I could and through discovering the ancient\
  \ cultures and traditions of Kyoto, fall in love with life and realise it is sometimes\
  \ the unexpected plans that turn out to be the best plans of all.\n\nMy first sightseeing\
  \ experience was the Kinkakuji Temple also known as the Golden Temple. I had arrived\
  \ just after dawn and as the early morning Sun rose above the gold leaf wrapped\
  \ Zen temple, there were rays of gold glistening all around the temple as it stood\
  \ peacefully in the middle of the lake. \nHaving been inspired by the beauty and\
  \ majestic sight of the Golden Temple I was so full of energy and desire to fully\
  \ immerse in the magic of Kyoto,\n\nI was compelled to go to the Fushimi Inari Taisha\
  \ Shrine later that same day. I stopped at the Kyoto Tower to take in the panoramic\
  \ views of the city extending as far as Osaka. As I made my pilgrimage to the Shrine\
  \ and up to Mount Inari\u2019s trail, I was taken aback by the peace and serenity\
  \ I felt. The lanterns lit up the path to the vermilion shrine gates, I had so many\
  \ wishes but as I walked through the trail I admired the resilience of the shrine\
  \ gates, how many wish-makers had touched them, leaned on them and as time passed\
  \ all had perished except for the pillars, they stood strong through it all. My\
  \ spirit was lifted from my midnight walk through the Fushimi Shrine, I was the\
  \ Queen of the Shrine that night. I wasn\u2019t sharing the experience with anyone\
  \ else, the moment belonged to me, there were no other midnight walkers in sight,\
  \ I was alone and wandering through the shrine leisurely without a care in the world.\
  \ The ancient scriptures are etched across all the traditional torri gates of the\
  \ shrine, I walked for hours enchanted by the flamed coloured red trail in honour\
  \ of the Shinto God, Inari. Only when it was time to leave, it was 2am, no trains\
  \ back to the hotel and a long hour walk back. As I sat there on the steps of Fushimi,\
  \ a woman arrived to pray and noticed me sat on the entrance stairs, with the help\
  \ of google translate I explained there were no more trains and I intended to walk,\
  \ she had other plans and drove me back to my hotel.\n\nNot satisfied with Kyoto\
  \ alone, I decided to catch the bullet train to Tokyo to see the Meiji Jingu Shrine.\
  \ I had seen many shrines in Kyoto, every side street is filled with many Shinto\
  \ temples, each with their own aura and allure. From dressing up as a geisha in\
  \ Gion to sampling the sumptuous fresh delicacies at the Nishiki market, Kyoto was\
  \ a solo traveller\u2019s paradise. However, there was something very special about\
  \ the Meiji Jingu Shrine in Tokyo, it was like stepping into Utopia. As I approached\
  \ the temple, I could see the most stunning tree I had ever seen in my life, it\
  \ was so gloriously green that I could not take my eyes off it, the meteo kusu trees\
  \ pulled me in with the power of its deities. As I floated towards the tree, I stood\
  \ directly under it and was embraced by the sacred camphor trees. From a distance,\
  \ the trees look like one, the leaves of the couple trees are intertwined in such\
  \ a way that it is only on close inspection that you discover that they are indeed\
  \ two trees joined together as one, the husband and wife tree, meteo kusu. As I\
  \ made a wish by the sacred trees and dropped my coins in the wish box, I bid Japan\
  \ farewell for now, knowing I would return again soon to pay homage to the deities\
  \ at Meiji Jingu Shrine."
