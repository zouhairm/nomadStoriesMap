Text: "The echoing canon goes off and suddenly the streets are painted in red. \n\n\
  Trucks begin to make their way through the streets, the men inside them shouting\
  \ as they pass. Men and woman around me brace themselves for the impact. \n\nI bend\
  \ down and pick up an oozing squashed tomato and hurl it straight toward my friend\u2019\
  s chest. The tomato splashes across his neck and he yells out in defeat as it gets\
  \ into his eyes. It\u2019s the annual La Tomatina festival, and the narrow streets\
  \ of Bu\xF1ol, Spain, are in chaos. \n\nPeople are pressed up against the walls,\
  \ dodging rotten tomatoes like they are on fire. Others lob tomatoes at strangers\
  \ with a ferocity that would make you think they are enemies. I can\u2019t help\
  \ but constantly laugh out loud and pieces of juicy tomato trickle into my mouth.\
  \ I make the mistake of opening my eyes at the wrong second as a bucket full of\
  \ tomatoes is dripped over my head, soaking my hair and my clothes. My boots squelch\
  \ with every step that I make, and I know that every inch of me is covered with\
  \ bits of tomato. \n\nPeople are singing and dancing as they are plummeted with\
  \ tomatoes, as if it is long-awaited rain falling from the heavens in a drought.\
  \ Everywhere I look people are howling with laughter and teasing each other catching\
  \ them with a face-full of tomatoes unaware. The cobbled streets are covered with\
  \ a sea of chunky tomatoes, rising up to my shins. Blurs of red constantly whizz\
  \ past people like they are being produced from tiny canons. I would never have\
  \ imagined people to be so happy to be soaked in rotten fruit. \n\nAs quickly as\
  \ it began, another canon goes off and the fighting seizes. Although a minute ago\
  \ the streets were filled people mercilessly launching tomatoes and friends and\
  \ strangers, everyone has their arms around each other, singing and chanting in\
  \ Spanish. I shake my head at the senselessness of another chaotic Spanish festival.\n\
  \nOn the streets, Spanish people are sharing food and drinks with strangers. Spanish\
  \ residents hose us down from their balconies from above, laughing as we seize up\
  \ from the cold water.\n\nStrangers offer me food and red wine. I am twirled around\
  \ and begin dancing with a group of older Spanish men, and they laugh when I can\u2019\
  t keep up with them. My eyes hurt from the citric acid of the tomatoes, but my cheeks\
  \ hurt even more from smiling ceaselessly. \n\nIn this place, I can be whoever I\
  \ want to be. As I dance and talk and sing with strangers, I feel myself becoming\
  \ someone who embraces more and cares less. I am embracing new adventures and listening\
  \ to the stories that others tell me, for everyone has something new to teach me.\
  \ \n\nI realise that travelling for me is about unbecoming. It is unbecoming everything\
  \ about me that has made me rigid and self-conscious and careful, so that I can\
  \ become who I was always meant to be and experience a life of adventure. When you\
  \ are being plummeted with tomatoes, your worries of your future or the gravity\
  \ of every small decision you have made no longer matter. All that matters in this\
  \ moment is that you are laughing, and you are happy, and that you need to watch\
  \ out because you are about to be dumped with a bucket full of tomatoes from a stranger\
  \ watching you from their balcony."
