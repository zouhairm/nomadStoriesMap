Text: "Let me tell you about the night I watched the good people of Madurai put Lord\
  \ Shiva to bed. It is a small tale, really, and one of no great complexity, so be\
  \ forewarned. I do not want you to be disappointed when you realize at its conclusion\
  \ that this simple story was just that, and had no deeper meaning.\n\nIn the larger\
  \ context of world affairs, where the evening news pivots around stories of great\
  \ wars, monstrous acts of violence, and disasters of cataclysmic proportions, Lord\
  \ Shiva\u2019s bedtime is a matter of very little import. Indeed, few are the people\
  \ outside of Madurai, India, who have even had occasion to witness it. Public relations\
  \ types have yet to turn the ritual into a media event.\n\nAnd so, fortuitously,\
  \ gaggles of tourists in polyester throngs have not yet discovered the simple and\
  \ affecting ritual that occurs nightly in this small town on the southern plains\
  \ of India.\n\nTo the half million residents of Madurai, Lord Shiva\u2019s bedtime\
  \ matters a great deal. In a country where gods hold dominion over many aspects\
  \ of a person\u2019s life, there is a tremendous desire to treat the most-loved\
  \ ones with respect. Among India\u2019s vast pantheon of deities, Shiva reigns supreme.\
  \ This is why, late each evening, as their ancestors have done before them, the\
  \ common folk of Madurai see Lord Shiva to sleep with his beloved, Meenakshi.\n\n\
  I have been privy to the act of reverence. Let me tell you about it.\n\nThe hour\
  \ is close to midnight. Inside the Meenakshi Temple, the maze of hallways that had\
  \ been dark by day are darker still by night. Afternoon\u2019s dampness has turned\
  \ cold and foreboding. Dark-skinned Indians in white cotton lungis swarm like mosquitos,\
  \ illuminated in eerie fashion by torches suspended from stone walls.\n\nI follow\
  \ the crowd to Shiva\u2019s chamber. They come for him with a gold palanquin, an\
  \ exquisite, covered litter. Four somber-faced Indians support the palanquin on\
  \ poles that span their sinewy shoulders. Reverently, they enter the god\u2019s\
  \ chamber, emerging moments later with the deity himself.\n\nThe procession to Meenakshi\u2019\
  s bedchamber, where Shiva spends each night with his beloved, begins. Before, behind,\
  \ and beside his litter, his entourage lights the way with torches held aloft. Gold,\
  \ transformed by the flames, blazes. At either side, others walk, holding aloft\
  \ staffs surmounted by enormous white plumes resembling feathers. Lazy metronomes,\
  \ they slowly and rhythmically sweep the air.\n\nThe sound of chimes is everywhere\u2014\
  or so it seems. First, from the rear. No, wait. It comes from in front of us. Or\
  \ does it? I cannot pinpoint the location, but I can swear to you that little bells\
  \ that go \u2018tinkle\u2019 by day take on unearthly tones at night.\n\nPeriodically,\
  \ our parade stops at a wall shrine. Light candles. Leave offerings. Ring bells.\
  \ Move on.\n\nPressed by hundreds of pilgrims in the gloomy labyrinth, I feel the\
  \ electricity. We are at a fever pitch when at last we reach the arched entrance\
  \ to Meenakshi\u2019s chamber. As a foreigner and a non-Hindu, I can go no further.\
  \ On tiptoe, I peer into the darkness, trying to catch a glimpse of what only the\
  \ holy men and Hindus can see.\n\nHoly men emerge with salvers of brass on which\
  \ sit conical piles of brilliant red vermilion, sandalwood paste, and petals of\
  \ rose and jasmine. The latter are sprinkled on the crowd, releasing sweet perfume.\
  \ And the vermilion? It is taken up by the holy men\u2019s thumbs to be daubed across\
  \ foreheads. The backs of outstretched hands receive the sandalwood paste.\n\nA\
  \ highly-polished footstool is placed before the palanquin. On it, a second brass\
  \ salver holds Shiva\u2019s symbolic slippers: two small, flat footprints of gold.\
  \ Blessings and invocations hang in the air as the golden \u2018slippers\u2019 are\
  \ placed inside the litter, the latter then passed through the arch. Shiva\u2019\
  s journey is over\u2014almost.\n\nPilgrim\u2019s disperse quickly, as silently as\
  \ they have come. Only the holy men remain; it is their charge to carry Shiva the\
  \ last few yards into the sanctum that is Meenakshi\u2019s repose. Come morning,\
  \ they will arrive early to wake the sleepy Shiva, and quietly\u2014and without\
  \ fanfare\u2014return him to his own room."
