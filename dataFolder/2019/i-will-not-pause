Text: "A journey is a retreat. A voyage is a pilgrimage. Travel gives us space to\
  \ nurture our connections with the universe. It is in this spirit that I visit places.\n\
  \nLast month, I visited Malta. I was in Malta for fifteen days. I based myself on\
  \ the main island. I spent a day on the island of Gozo.\n\nA lot has transpired\
  \ on these islands throughout the centuries. People have much to boast. Yet, the\
  \ humbleness of the Maltese seems extraordinary.\n\nSaint Paul was shipwrecked on\
  \ the island. I was delighted to be a part of the Feast of Saint Paul\u2019s Shipwreck\
  \ in the capital Valletta. A stranger asked me if I was a Catholic. I told him that\
  \ I\u2019m not, but that I did attend a Jesuit school. He extended his best wishes\
  \ to me. He came across as genuine and warm.\n\nA restaurant owner in the fishing\
  \ village of Marsaxlokk told me that I have been unlucky. I gave him a snippet of\
  \ my life\u2019s story as a part of a conversation. He offered me a cup of coffee.\
  \ I decided to move on.\n\nI went to St. Paul\u2019s Cathedral in the fortified\
  \ city of Mdina. The Maltese Philharmonic Orchestra performed Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart\u2019\
  s \u201CGreat\u201D Mass. It was a beautiful setting for a delightful composition.\
  \ I looked at Jesus on the cross. I thought I should imagine some other people on\
  \ the cross too.\n\nThe Sicilian that I met at the hostel was very kind to me. I\
  \ had picked up a bottle of Maltese Syrah from a shop at St. Paul\u2019s Bay. Maltese\
  \ wines are wonderful. I ran into the man from Sicily in the kitchen. I asked him\
  \ if he has seen an opener in the kitchen. He did not find any. I did not find any.\
  \ He used a knife to open the bottle for me. I let him have the lion\u2019s share\
  \ of the bottle. A traveller from Spain who became a friend also joined. My new\
  \ friend from Madrid facilitated the evening conversation between me and the Sicilian.\
  \ The Sicilian was surprised by the distance that I had travelled.\n\nI discovered\
  \ how best to mix Kinnie with alcohol on this island where pint-sized cocktails\
  \ is the norm. It goes best with Campari. It was the barman at a quaint bar on St.\
  \ George\u2019s Bay that I\u2019m thankful to. I cannot underestimate the value\
  \ of conversing a local barman. Among other things, he can provide insights into\
  \ the local political economy.\n\nI visited a band club in the capital Valletta.\
  \ It has been around since 1874. It was full of local patrons. The barman sensed\
  \ my enthusiasm about the place. He offered me a free cheese cake, which is a savoury,\
  \ and is not to be confused with cheesecake. \n\nMalta\u2019s geography makes it\
  \ geopolitically significant. International intrigue is not unknown to the island.\
  \ I had a chat with someone who was minding a store that sold alcohol. He told me\
  \ that his friend is the owner. He informed me that his nation is the most powerful.\
  \ He told me that he worked for his country. I had a fairly long conversation with\
  \ him. He had questions for me. I had questions for him. It is unfortunate that\
  \ I never went back to the store.\n\nTo travel is to open the door to epiphany.\
  \ The pilgrimage endures. The next destination beckons."
