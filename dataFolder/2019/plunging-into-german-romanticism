Text: "Strasbourg, France. 26th January, 2019. 8:26. Guten Morgen! I'm in a bus, listening\
  \ to the song ''Sigurdlied'' by the german medieval folk band Faun. I'm on the way\
  \ of my 7 years old dream, the city of Heidelberg, considered to be the most romantic\
  \ city of Germany. Can anyone tell me that dreams don't come true? Before that,\
  \ let me tell you the story of the most magical and most beautiful dream of mine.\
  \ \nYears ago I started to learn German at university and was discovering German\
  \ music. Days and nights I was listening to new songs, finding new words and feeling\
  \ an incredible happiness with every new one. I remember how inspired I was, when\
  \ my teacher was telling about her trips to Germany. She used to say :''I see and\
  \ admire your enthusiasm and when you give so much energy to something, by all means\
  \ it will return in some way''. Until now I have not hesitated a second that my\
  \ dream is possible. I've always felt only positive vibes towards this subject.\
  \ Now, I'm smiling and I\u2019m incapable to control the tears of happiness. Years\
  \ ago, I was listening to these same songs, dreaming to visit Germany, and now,\
  \ I\u2019m looking from the window of the bus and going straight to my dream. I\
  \ think to myself : ''How beautiful the world is, and how magically the universe\
  \ turns my dreams into reality! All my decisions, all the obstacles that have changed\
  \ my destiny, have led to this moment''. \nThis trip has a special meaning for me.\
  \ It took me some years and a lot of efforts to come here. I'm from Armenia and\
  \ it's not so easy for us to travel in case you're not rich. That's why I'm the\
  \ happiest in the group: isn't it wonderful? When everything is reachable, we lose\
  \ the ability to appreciate. Everything becomes ordinary and it's so sad. I'm happy\
  \ to be able to feel this.\nHeidelberg. Feels like home. It's peaceful, warm (despite\
  \ the cold weather), comfy and welcoming. Walking in these narrow, cozy streets\
  \ is a therapy for the soul. The castle, the river Neckar and the mountains are\
  \ so harmonious. The tour guide says that the Heidelberg castle is so dramatically\
  \ beautiful, famous and inspiring because of and thanks to its scars. It was ruined\
  \ more than once. Our scars make us much more valuable and beautiful. Even if they\
  \ hurt inside, only beauty is visible from the outside. Looking to these ruins,\
  \ it feels like I'm seeing all of these historical events: the days of glory and\
  \ the days of misery. It is just impossible to describe the atmosphere in words.\
  \ Just go there with your headphones, turn on the song ''Minne'' of Faun and Subway\
  \ to Sally and walk\u2026 It's so sad and so majestic at the same time. But you\
  \ have to feel it and let it inside you: German Romanticism in its whole beauty\
  \ and nobility. Even if you are the most cynical and the most feelingless human\
  \ being in this world, Heidelberg will change you in a way you could never expect.\
  \ The famous song says \u201CIch habe mein Herz in Heidelberg verloren\u201D (I\u2019\
  ve lost my heart in Heidelberg), but I guess I\u2019ve found mine here\u2026\nBy\
  \ the way, a queen called Elizabeth lived here in 17th century, and it makes me\
  \ feel special.  \nThere's one place that I unfortunately couldn't visit: the Philosopher's\
  \ Walk. Many famous philosophers, writers and professors have walked there and been\
  \ inspired by the beauty of nature, the great view on the city and the freshness\
  \ of the mountainous air. As a nature and philosophy lover I would like to walk\
  \ there, but as always I try to see the good side of everything. In my opinion,\
  \ walking on Philosopher's Walk can become a good reason for coming back. I touched\
  \ the mirror of the Heidelberg Bridge Monkey, so I'll be back!  \nThis day gave\
  \ me hope and confidence that my other dreams also can come true. And why not? Taking\
  \ into account how magically my dreams come true, I guess one day I\u2019ll die\
  \ from the overdose of happiness."
