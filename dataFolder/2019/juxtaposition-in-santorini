Text: "We\u2019ve arrived! After a long 20+ hours of travel yesterday we finally landed\
  \ in Santorini, first stop on this month long journey. Last night we watched the\
  \ sun set over the caldera, a dripping fuchsia ball of light dipping down towards\
  \ the sea. This morning I watched it rise again, the night having had no effect\
  \ on its splendour. Doves cooed, roosters crowed, a donkey brayed, church bells\
  \ rang\u2026 and the ever-present traffic of the busy one-way street winding it's\
  \ way up past our small hotel muffled all of the other sounds as dilapidated cars\
  \ and rattling motorbikes hurtled past; locals on their way to work. A few smiled\
  \ and nodded my way. An older gentleman tipped his hat with a warm \u201CCalimera!\u201D\
  .\n\nLater in the day we headed to explore Santorini town. What struck me most as\
  \ we walked through town today, what I was not expecting at all, were the contrasts.\
  \ Snuggled in between pristine hotels, with their infinity pools shimmering in the\
  \ sun and private decks overlooking the caldera, are the vestiges of faded splendour.\
  \ Empty and crumbling shells that echo inaudibly of the money once spent within\
  \ their walls. Prime real estate in a hub of touristic frenzy, lying barren; empty\
  \ save for scraps of garbage and twisted metal long since discarded and baking in\
  \ the unforgiving sun. It eludes me how they have not been restored. Perhaps they\
  \ were ruined in the earthquake of 1956\u2026 but why do they remain in ruins when\
  \ butted up against them are hotels with rooms that rent for upwards of 500 euro/night?\n\
  \nA more alluring tourist trap could not be imagined. Stunning views, pastel and\
  \ white and blue stucco, accordion music. Cruise ships disgorge their cargo multiple\
  \ times a day. The throngs come spilling up the hill by donkey or cable car and\
  \ clog the narrow arteries that are Santorini's streets like so much cholesterol.\
  \ The side streets and local parks we explored were far more interesting to me than\
  \ the main streets of town. Slightly unkempt, a bit shabby and run down, nevertheless\
  \ full of character. Local teens congregating in an underground walkway, rife with\
  \ flavourful \u201Cpoetry\u201D. Young men in the park, smoking and chatting. An\
  \ old man napping on a narrow stair, his donkey driving stick resting on the wall\
  \ behind him. A little boy in the park animatedly enjoying a game with only a pencil\
  \ and the large side of a flattened cardboard box. A glimpse into the lives of the\
  \ people who actually live in this place, who call it home\u2026 at least for part\
  \ of the year. \n\nWe have two more days here and already I am looking ahead to\
  \ Naxos. I am eager to leave behind the throngs of tourists and noisy vehicles that\
  \ seem to define this place. However there are charms here for those who are prepared\
  \ to step away from the glitz and draw of souvenirs and alcohol and explore the\
  \ shabbier side-streets and local haunts of this most famous of Greek island towns."
