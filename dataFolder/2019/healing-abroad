Text: "When asked about my study abroad experience by friends, family, and even curious\
  \ strangers, I often boast that I waltzed into my Bajan adventure during my junior\
  \ year of college bound by neither great expectations nor paralyzing fears. In hindsight,\
  \ however, this sentiment isn't entirely true/accurate. From the moment in which\
  \ I first accepted the offer to study abroad at the beginning of junior year, I\
  \ welcomed the opportunity to explore an unfamiliar country for the duration of\
  \ a semester. Yes, I'd be leaving behind the fast-paced academic, social, and extracurricular\
  \ environment and life I'd built for myself in Westwood. But the prospect of diving\
  \ headfirst into the unknown was something I'd been raised to welcome with an open\
  \ heart and curious mind. Truthfully, I knew very little about Barbados outside\
  \ of it being the celebrated birthplace of the globally acclaimed Black music, fashion,\
  \ and style icon Robyn 'Rihanna' Fenty. By\_the time I boarded my morning flight\
  \ from Ft. Lauderdale to Bridgetown in January 2018, I knew to anticipate the sort\
  \ ethereal beauty, enticing climate, and whimsical adventures that Western minds\
  \ are often taught to associate with Caribbean island-nations.\n\nIn my four months\
  \ abroad, I spent more time at the beach than at the library, engaged with Afro-Caribbean\
  \ folks from a variety of island-nations, and confronted the social justice issues\
  \ I'd studied at UCLA in an entirely new context. More importantly, I was able to\
  \ explore my interiority \u2013 my blackness, my womanhood, my struggles with mental\
  \ illness \u2013 in unknown spaces. While traveling, I learned to mourn pieces of\
  \ myself that I'd learned to live without, laying them to rest in some of the most\
  \ beautiful corners of my world. I reflected on the abundance of reciprocated love,\
  \ friendship, healing, beauty, purpose, wisdom, hope, and warmth in my life \u2013\
  \_and resolved to further cultivate and protect the relationships and things in\
  \ life for which I am grateful. In Barbados, I fell out of love with the familiarity\
  \ of traumas of mental illness, and further in love with the will to live, to love,\
  \ to laugh, to thrive. I learned the meaning of trusting myself, which\_ultimately\
  \ manifested in the form of healing. Healing is allowing oneself to remain in communion\
  \ with one\u2019s most sacred and vulnerable emotions, unfettered by the promise\
  \ of bittersweet endings and changes and goodbyes. To heal is to forgive oneself\
  \ for burying the pain when, in fact, it demanded to be felt. It is loving out loud,\
  \ not in spite of love lost, rather because of it.\_I was able to navigate nuanced\
  \ spaces and uneven emotional terrain armed with tools of compassion, self-awareness,\
  \ and emotional intelligence that I'd developed and strengthened through 14 months\
  \ of intensive therapy throughout college.\n\nSurprisingly, my experiences abroad\
  \ allowed me to reconfigure the complexities of my relationship with my body into\
  \ a much healthier relationship with the beach. In the countless hours I spent lounging\
  \ on white sand or floating in the crystalline waters of the Caribbean, I practiced\
  \ new forms of self-love by displacing the anxieties of nakedness, vulnerability,\
  \ and intimacy from outside of my own being. I grieved the loss of my pre-remission\
  \ body \u2013\_the perverse seductiveness of its thinness and frailness brought\
  \ on by a serious eating disorder \u2013 and practiced celebrating every inch of\
  \ myself. With each weekly (and sometimes, daily) trip to the beach, I practiced\
  \ loving my sun kissed caramel skin, the unapologetic curvature of my hips, the\
  \ clumsy crookedness of my two front teeth, the curliness of my honey-colored hair.\
  \ And surely, I began to let go of the self-doubt and self-hatred I carried within\
  \ my heart still, as water danced across each surface of my healing body with neither\
  \ hesitation nor judgement. At the end of my program, I found myself inter sacrum\
  \ saxumque, eager to dive into a summer NYC fellowship, while saddened to exchange\
  \ wet goodbyes with the three beautiful roommates I'd grown to love and laugh with,\
  \ and in whom I'd sought refuge every day for the past four months. My study abroad\
  \ was so intimately rejuvenating, challenging, hilarious, and precious. Ultimately,\
  \ I am grateful for Barbados, for it brought me closer to myself and to the beach."
