Text: "Last summer I traveled to Puerto Escondido y my home country of Mexico, and\
  \ one day they were going to liberate baby sea turtles, I didn\u2019t know they\
  \ were going to do it, so when they told us it was taking place in literally 5 minutes,\
  \ i ran to the beach as fast as I could ( I don\u2019t run fast, I did the effort\
  \ of a lifelime) and just hoped I could get one of those little beautiful creatures\
  \ to guide into the ocean. I did, but before, all the people there and I listened\
  \ to a man talking about sea wildlife and animals in danger of extinction, mostly\
  \ about sea turtles, and there were some facts that were incredible, but there were\
  \ others as well that were devastating, when he finished telling us all these facts,\
  \ they drew a line on the wet sand, we all counted to three, and laid the turtles\
  \ to commence their journey into what was going to be their home for hopefully years\
  \ and years to come. They hardly moved at the beginning, it was as if they didn\u2019\
  t want to leave our side, like a baby in its mothers arms, but after a while ( quite\
  \ long, in fact) they started to walk at the sound of the ocean. They looked so\
  \ beautiful and tiny, and they were going towards the ocean, that is also beautiful,\
  \ but it\u2019s immense. And then, I realized these turtles are just like us, we\
  \ were once that same size, caring about nothing than to be with our mums, then\
  \ we grew and started to want to face life, with all the problems it contains and\
  \ overcome them as best as possible. I realized it was just as if they were humans.\
  \ And I found so beautiful to come into the realization that no matter the nationality\
  \ of the people that were there, because there were people from lots of countries,\
  \ no matter how long we had to wait for the little turtles to go into the ocean,\
  \ we all cared, once they left we were all concerned about them, what was going\
  \ to be of them, whether or not they were going to live to be 100 years old, if\
  \ they will ever have other little turtles, etc. And it was incredibly Interesting\
  \ that, when it comes to life, and well being we all unite, we don\u2019t care about\
  \ where we come from, our gender, age, skin color; we care about life, and love\
  \ of life, and it was beautiful to see that for a moment there wasn\u2019t anything\
  \ we cared about but those little balls of life. We, in that moment felt proud and\
  \ happy that we helped, and I think it was a moment that I\u2019ll never forget.\
  \ A trip that will stay in my memory forever. I think, we can take this moment to\
  \ see that we all care about our planet and the life in it, maybe non-believers\
  \ or just people in general should experience something like this, to start putting\
  \ an end to the masssive destruction that we are creating, not only in our wildlife,\
  \ but in our home of earth. Because we are all citizens of it, and should care and\
  \ take care of it."
