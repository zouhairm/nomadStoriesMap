Text: "The humidity caused droplets of sweat to uncomfortably trickle down my forehead\
  \ and back. With a corner of my headscarf I wiped across my forehead. I had been\
  \ staying in safe houses throughout Rojava for my first two months in Syria, though\
  \ I was not yet accustomed to the formidable summer. Today, a few of us western\
  \ volunteers were heading into civilization for the first time. We approached the\
  \ city of Derik.\n\nMy assumption was that I would see dull expressions, a state\
  \ of seeming abandonment, and get whiffs of pollution when entering the city. The\
  \ heartwarming reality consisted of vibrant stalls, an aroma of freshly baked baklava\
  \ (honey soaked pastries), and best of all - the Kurdish community was smiling.\
  \ An expectation vs reality comparison, where the latter actually improves. After\
  \ all, who would ever have expected to find a city with so much spirit on the outskirts\
  \ of war torn Syria?\n\nMost locals knew friends, family and acquaintances who were\
  \ currently fighting the remains of ISIS in the cities nearby, yet maintained a\
  \ brave exterior. This common positivity put children at ease and gave a sense of\
  \ hope to the people. Their resilience pushed them onwards.\n\nIn one store I wanted\
  \ to purchase insect repellant. My hands were covered in countless bites, extending\
  \ to sporadic spots across my face.\n\nBeing monolingual made learning the local\
  \ language challenging. After greeting the man at the counter in Kurmanji Kurdish,\
  \ I shuffled through my pocket dictionary to find a translation for repellent. It\
  \ was difficult to find any variation.  As I desperately ruffled back and forth\
  \ through the pages, I heard the man laugh. His amused expression made me smile.\
  \ I told him one minute, yek daqe.\n\n\u201CI speak English,\u201D he said.\n\n\u201C\
  Oh! Sorry, I should have asked. I am not used to meeting English speakers here.\u201D\
  \ I felt my cheeks warm. Lucky I had not resorted to plan B, which was to start\
  \ miming.\n\n\u201CWhere you are from?\u201D\n\n\u201CNew Zealand.\u201D\n\n\u201C\
  I know country. They lots of drinking.\u201D His English was endearing.\n\nNot many\
  \ locals knew where my country was. At least he was familiar with it\u2026 even\
  \ if it was about our drinking habits. \u201CI believe you might be thinking of\
  \ our neighbours in Australia,\u201D I joked.\n\nHe asked me what I needed and returned\
  \ with a paper bag. Once I had paid, we wished each other a good day and good health.\
  \ Later, I noticed that he had given me two extra repellants for free.\n\nA reputable\
  \ trait of the locals was to help those in need. A humbling observation was that\
  \ I did not see any homeless people in Derik. They treated the wider community as\
  \ family, including myself. The desolation terrorism brought upon Syria could not\
  \ corrupt their cultural morals. The positive outlook was to respect the soldiers,\
  \ who were fighting and dying for their freedom on the front lines nearby. Derik\
  \ was a city of hope."
