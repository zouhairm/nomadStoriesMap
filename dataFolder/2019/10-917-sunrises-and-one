Text: "Everything started from the flying pig.\nI was in a place that is not on maps.\
  \ Except the one someone sketched for me. \nLike lots of good stories, it starts\
  \ in a place too insignificant to place it in an atlas. \nI was sitting at the fire\
  \ camp in a forest, when he approached. \nWithout a word he took my notebook and\
  \ drew for me a winged pig. \nSo of course in an instant we became friends. \nAs\
  \ we were nomads, we begun visiting each other once a year, every time in a different\
  \ country. Never twice in the same one. \nI went to Belgium to his house with golden\
  \ handle that he (accidentally, he says...) stole from Vatican. Sitting at his terrace\
  \ that had a collection of the weirdest art (as he puts it) or garbage (as everyone\
  \ else would), we wrote our bucket lists. \nHe came to Jordan where for his birthday\
  \ we were trying to scuba dive with umbrellas. For no other reason than love of\
  \ surrealism. \nI flew to the US as he bought us Bob Dylan's concert tickets. \n\
  Then he nearly died in Africa and while in malaria fever, in a tent in the desert,\
  \ he wrote a letter to me on a page from \"Harry Potter\". After that he came to\
  \ Poland to prove he is alive. \nFinally, we met in Egypt. That was his bucket list\
  \ line. To see the Winter Solstice in Karnak temple. \nThe shortest day of the year\
  \ was a special day for anonymous ancient architect. That day the ball of the Sun\
  \ scores all the goals in the temple. It seems to be coming straight through the\
  \ gate. Sacred version of basketball if you like.\nAnd so, just for one dawn, we\
  \ traveled to \"The Most Selected of All Places\" as ancient Egyptians called this\
  \ territory.  \nIt was the main place of worship of Amun. The name meant something\
  \ like \"the hidden\" or \"invisible\". So here we were searching for a ghost in\
  \ four thousands year old hunted house.\n\nWe got up at 5 a.m. Late! Now we needed\
  \ a taxi!\nBut we were not guests of a fancy hotel. And the city at this time was\
  \ abandoned. Not a single car on the road. For one moment we panicked that we came\
  \ all this way just for a show that we will miss. We suspected the superstar won't\
  \ wait for us... \nWe run in the darkness that was less and less thick... But the\
  \ Egyptian gods, no perfect themselves, had a good mood. Apparently they had a weak\
  \ spot for sleepy sinners. Because on the horizon appeared old Mercedes! It was\
  \ not a taxi, but in Egypt every car is a taxi if you have few bucks. We waved like\
  \ maniacs. The driver stopped, looked at us puzzled and let us in. \nWe made it\
  \ just in time to see traditional Egyptian dancing group. Otherwise there was almost\
  \ no one.\nWe sat at the ground and waited. \nI am not a patient person. If there\
  \ is one thing I HATE, it is waiting. But travel waiting is a very different kind.\
  \ This silence spoke hieroglyphs. \nThere was magic in this prologue, like sitting\
  \ in a first row in theater, anticipating anxiously the curtain to lift.\nAnd then\
  \ it appeared. \nThe fiery ball entered the temple. Acting nonchalant, yet aware\
  \ of its greatness. Oh, this party is just for me? - it seemed to say.\nAlmost touchable.\
  \ Fresh. We watched it as if seeing Sun for the very first time.\n\nThen I counted.\
  \ There has been 10.917 sunrises in my life so far. Most of them unconscious.  \n\
  This was a one that felt just like it should: a contract renewal, an exclamation\
  \ mark in we-are-alive shout, like winning a battle with darkness and getting yet\
  \ another chance to set things straight. Or at least to try.\nBut... wasn't it special,\
  \ because we decided to make it so? \nMaybe that is why we keep setting on yet another\
  \ journey. To let traveling be a reminder of things we unlearned to notice."
