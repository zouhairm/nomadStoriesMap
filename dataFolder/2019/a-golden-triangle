Text: "It's true what they say, the old adage, the moment you land in the country\
  \ you can smell what awaits. The hot, aromatic air engulfs you as you step off the\
  \ plane at Indira Gandhi International airport. The mustard and pink carpet blankets\
  \ your steps into the chaos ahead. \n\nI had come to India with my dearest friend\
  \ Aimee. We arrived prepared and I, like most white people, was certain that I would\
  \ get Delhi belly. She was, perhaps rightly so, certain that the tap water was not\
  \ to be touched and hand wipes were god's own answer.  I had packed valoid, immodium\
  \ and every other stomach remedy I had heard of- mint tea, liquorice, you name it.\
  \ \n\nSo naturally, in the spirit of preparedness rather than risk aversion, I threw\
  \ myself into my Indian adventures with the appetite of a large man. Every meal\
  \ I approached as if it were my last before the inevitable would surely happen.\
  \ I drank lassi's off the street, ate all the vegetarian fare my soul could muster\
  \ and was delighted at the the non-vegetarian queues at the Burger King.\n\nWe had\
  \ been taken with the idea of India since we were in school. Now at twenty-seven,\
  \ we were undertaking what our teenage hearts had fixated on for many years, and\
  \ I assure you, it was better than expected. This wasn't to be a spiritual trip,\
  \ it took a week of begging to get Aimee to do a single yoga class.  It also wasn't\
  \ a 'lets go to Goa and party' kind of outlet, although that being said, India really\
  \ does offer various forms of peace. \n\nThe spirituality was more at the bottom\
  \ of a bowl and the in the last of the tea leaves. The shopping, sightseeing, enthusiastic\
  \ temple attendance and the soul-searching chats over endless pots of ceylon in\
  \ the blistering heat brought us the necessary grounding.\n\nI am not exaggerating\
  \ when I say it was the trip of a lifetime. It got said to me on more than one occasion\
  \ by the many friendly drivers and hospitality staff during our stay 'this is India\
  \ ma'm, anything is possible', and so it was. We started in Delhi and proceeded\
  \ on to the rest of the Golden Triangle-  Agra and Jaipur as the cherry on top.\
  \ \n\nIf I am intensely critical I would give Agra a miss, but to be fair, the Taj\
  \ truly is quite spectacular. The city itself I can do without, it's a bit of a\
  \ tourist trap and badly kept. However, with my luck and as fate would have it,\
  \ the incredible travel disruptions that occurred will forever remain some of my\
  \ funniest memories. \n\nFor instance I called a taxi for our trip from Dehli to\
  \ Agra and was assured that our driver knew exactly where we going. Dear thoughtful\
  \ Arjun truly did not. He missed the turn off to Agra and naturally proceeded to\
  \ Reverse Down a National Highway. My privileged little nerves were shot, but not\
  \ to worry, this was India after all. \n\nOn our flight from Dehli to Jaipur we\
  \ got caught in the most unbelievable turbulence (hint, don't fly around in summer\
  \ in India, the wind will get the better of you), and I, in true style, was in the\
  \ lavatory at this particular moment, delicately with my flowing India pants around\
  \ my ankles. Ever the glamour queen.\n\nI don't have time and space to indulge you\
  \ this time with the details of Mumbai and the tactics when visiting the Gateway\
  \ of India but I do beseech you to go see it for yourself.  I also speak broadly\
  \ now of the trip as it happened a year ago and some of the details evade me. However,\
  \ due the expected weight loss and subsequent lack of sickness (all you need to\
  \ do is not be a total moron and eat raw chicken or drink from the Ganges) I am\
  \ pleased to say that I arrived home two weeks later, 4 kilograms heavier and a\
  \ lifetime happier."
