Text: "We had been deceived. In our deception we had foolishly forgotten the most\
  \ important piece of advice for hiking - be prepared for the weather to change in\
  \ an instant. This is particularly prevalent in high altitude zones as we were in,\
  \ atop of Mt Kosciusko at 2228m above sea level. \n\nThe perfect climate we had\
  \ had on the hike up soon changed around 5am the next morning when our tents began\
  \ furiously shaking as the rain beat down upon them. With the wind threatening to\
  \ unearth our pegs, my father and I got in first and packed up as fast as we could\
  \ in the strenuous conditions. \n\nAs we began our descent of the mountain, freezing\
  \ raindrops pierced our skin like a kind of ice acupuncture, but our determination\
  \ to reach the base before conditions worsened kept us moving. Sleet began to fall,\
  \ combined with the hours of rain beforehand made the wire mesh of the trail impossible\
  \ to walk on without accident, our 12kg packs providing little in the way of stability\
  \ to accommodate. We were the only people who had camped on the summit, so as we\
  \ linked arms and assumed the crawl position to make it down safely, it was more\
  \ comical than humiliating. \n\nA few kilometres down, winds began to reach 140km/ph,\
  \ making the descent a near impossible task. Our solace came at a toilet shack whose\
  \ lights invited our cold bodies to retire for a moment. Entering the small shack,\
  \ we were met with the frozen faces of 20 hikers - a tour group with many people\
  \ experiencing their first hike in this weather. \nOut of the coldness came warmth\
  \ of the spirit of these people, offering us what little coffee or oatmeal they\
  \ had with them. Sipping on the black elixir, I was taken aback with one man, Sam,\
  \ and his energetic rendition of \u2018Who Shot The Sheriff\u2019, as the unfazed\
  \ 24 year old jogged around the shack belting it out with all his might, not letting\
  \ the early morning nor the impending uncomfortableness of the hike down dampen\
  \ his spirit. \n\nAfter listening to the forth, or perhaps fifth, attempt at him\
  \ hitting the right notes, the cold didn't seem so terrible to brave and we set\
  \ off once more. Arm in arm, we crawled back down, with mud constraining us from\
  \ below, and rain attacking us from above. \n\nStill in his pyjamas from the rush\
  \ to save our tents, my dad was becoming unsettled and uncomfortable in his drenched\
  \ tracksuit pants. Stripping down to his boxers, he let the pants go free expecting\
  \ them to drift off into the Victorian mountain ranges. \n\nFreezing, muddy, and\
  \ wet, we eventually made it to the point of embarkment to take the chairlift down\
  \ to Jindabyne. The exposed chairs swung in the wind, possessed by a force we weren\u2019\
  t keen to encounter. Debating our next move, I turn around to see none other than\
  \ Sheriff Sam striding towards us, beaming in delight with himself. \n\n\u201CI\
  \ think you forgot these, mate\u201D, he joked as the abandoned pair of soaked pants\
  \ is handed back to my dad. Perhaps it was the kindness of this stranger to track\
  \ him down in a blizzard to return an old pair of pants, or the hours he\u2019d\
  \ just spent crawling down the highest mountain in the country in his underwear,\
  \ but I have never seen my dad as emotional as he was about this piece of saturated\
  \ cloth. To this day, and as much as he denies it, I still believe the raindrop\
  \ on my father\u2019s chilled skin was truly a tear of gratitude."
