Text: I always wanted to explore the world since I was a kid. To me traveling the
  world was seeing the beauty of the world and life through the eyes of other people.
  I always loved to explore and see how different people and cultures make the world
  a beautiful place to live. My first international trip was last year in 2018. My
  first international trip was to the world's richest country, Qatar. I was very excited
  to explore a whole new part of the world. My trip to Qatar was an enriching experience
  and I changed my life in a whole new way.  I explored different places in Qatar
  and I always carried my camera.  I used to click pictures of every place I visited
  and then when I got home, I used to write about whatever, I explore. Qatar as a
  country is a very peaceful country. It has a very rich culture and tourist places
  like Souq-Waqif and Museum of Islamic Arts told me a lot about the history of Qatar.
  The Sealine beach of Qatar was the place where I made a real connection with the
  place. I met many people from different countries and all of us did barbeque and
  enjoyed together by the beach. It made me realize how we as humans are similar in
  so many ways. As I visited different places, I spoke to different people and understood
  about the way they live. I also explored the local markets and food in Qatar which
  completed my journey. Food always brings people together. After I came back to India,
  I wrote several articles on my blog and I also got my work published in a newspaper.
  The joy of writing about my stay in Qatar made me relive each moment, I spent there
  and I wish could do it someday all over again,
