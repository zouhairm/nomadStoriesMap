Text: "Nothing was familiar. Not the language, the cuisine, the humor or the faces\
  \ on the street. It\u2019s something as simple as recognizing a stranger. You know,\
  \ the one at the coffee shop that you see everyday. You may never talk to them but\
  \ it\u2019s comforting and familiar to see them when you order your espresso before\
  \ work. Nobody knew my face and I didn\u2019t know theirs. Being only twenty years\
  \ of age, I was on the cusp of life. Everything was an adventure and a possibility.\
  \ Back then I was introverted and shy which is a difficult thing to be when you\u2019\
  re in a foreign country, especially one so full of life like Spain. \n\nI stood\
  \ out. My clothing was that of a typical American college student. I quickly learned\
  \ that I had to adjust to the culture, at least in one small controllable way. How\
  \ I held my silverware, how I ordered my coffee, even to how I went about my day\
  \ was challenged. My identity was in question as I made this transition to life\
  \ abroad and all while starting a new relationship with a man who I had only spent\
  \ a total of three weeks with in person. \n\nTwenty years of age and starting over\
  \ before I had even started anything. Little did I know these were the smallest\
  \ of details and there was still so much more change ahead. In just a few months\
  \ time I would be working for Ryanair, traveling around Europe, getting into high\
  \ speed car chases and ultimately getting married."
