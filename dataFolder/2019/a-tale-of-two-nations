Text: "Rizwan interrupted my thoughts for the first time since I rode his taxi from\
  \ the airport, \u201CDid you land from Lahore or Islamabad, Madam? He inquired.\
  \ \u201CDelhi\u201D, I replied abruptly.  There was a minute of awkward silence\
  \ between us. Rizwan stared in the front mirror, with his eyes popped out as my\
  \ answer ill-fitted his expectation. To his disbelief, his passenger for the day\
  \ was an Indian female who stepped solo in his land. In some parts of the world,\
  \ this would be ordinary, but here it wasn\u2019t. This land wasn\u2019t any land;\
  \ it was Pakistan, a land-borne as a result of partition from India.  Rizwan was\
  \ uneasy for a minute as he referenced to the latest tension between the two countries.\n\
  \nAs Rizwan spoke more about his country, he sounded different than me only when\
  \ he said pa instead of fa. As I looked around the streets of Karachi, the scenes\
  \ felt familiar. I had been through these streets, I had played on these footpaths\
  \ and I have lived this culture. I did this all; in my grandpa\u2019s stories, I\
  \ grew up listening. Every time my grandpa spoke about Karachi, his eyes glittered,\
  \ his face glowed and he spoke with passion. Amidst all the political tension, I\
  \ wanted to live his stories myself and so I flew to Karachi. He lived in Delhi\
  \ now, but Karachi was his original home only until a line ran between the one nation\
  \ dividing it into two. A line that transformed our culture into mine and Rizwan\u2019\
  s culture.\n\nThe taxi screeched to a halt as Rizwan had hit the brakes hard to\
  \ escape a motorcycle collision.  He inquired whether I was alright; however, I\
  \ could barely hear him as the truck behind us honked producing a deafening din.\
  \ As he manoeuvred his way out, a pit in the road hindered his success while a motorcycle\
  \ driven cart obscured our path. This wasn\u2019t a new experience for me; however,\
  \ I was new in this foreign land. The gridlock traffic, honking noises and the dusty\
  \ air, everything was familiar to me.\n\nI watched out of the window as we drove\
  \ onward. Ladies in their late twenties giggled on the footpath. They wore long\
  \ shirts and loose pants. Unstitched white pieces of cloth hung from their neck.\
  \ I checked myself in Rizwan\u2019s side mirror and then looked at the girls again.\
  \ Our clothes were uncannily similar. We belonged to two lands whose ideology never\
  \ resembled, however, the people did.\n\nA narrow path stood between the two sides\
  \ of the road, decorated with colourful fruits sold over carts, similar to the road\
  \ I used to pass by as I walked for my school. As the traffic light turned red,\
  \ Rizwan bought me a plate of yellow rice mixed with meat from one of those stalls.\
  \ The aroma, the colour, the richness competed with the one my mother made every\
  \ Friday. Rizwan\u2019s hospitality reminded me of my father\u2019s. Further down\
  \ the food street, tall, brown canisters had dark coloured water that dripped around\
  \ as girls tussled to fill round, soggy balls with it. On the other corner, men\
  \ sat by the footpath eating a thick broth, cooked in huge silver pots which glittered\
  \ in the sun. Such love and lust for food were familiar to those I had experienced\
  \ on the streets of Delhi.\n\nFar in the distance, the Sun kissed the land as they\
  \ merged.  A narrow white line ran along the horizon dividing the Sun and the land\
  \ like India and Pakistan.  My land is similar to Rizwan and so is my language,\
  \ my food, my clothes and my culture. Then why my origin amazed him? Why are we\
  \ so similar but so separated? Why do India and Pakistan run like two parallel lines,\
  \ always together but always distanced? Is it because of our political differences\
  \ overriding our cultural similarities or we valued been rivals rather than been\
  \ neighbours?\n\nI sat and wrestled with my thoughts drawing the similarities between\
  \ two nations, meanwhile, Rizwan has reached my destination. He bided me goodbye\
  \ and guess what, he did it the same way we did on my side of the border."
