Text: "Walking, or I should say wandering, for what feels like hours through the different\
  \ terminals of the cold airport in Amsterdam. Every once in a while, I look up because\
  \ of a familiar sound. It\u2019s the sound of my own language. Although it\u2019\
  s my own, somehow, I still seem surprised by its frequent use. It doesn\u2019t seem\
  \ normal anymore. So, I just keep wandering through the cold industrial corridors\
  \ of the airport. It\u2019s 5 o\u2019clock in the morning and I feel detached. I\
  \ know around a few more corners there are people waiting for me. People I love\
  \ dearly.\n \nI should quicken my step, but instead I hesitantly linger. I don\u2019\
  t really feel excited, I guess I feel numb. This is it, this is the end of the adventure\
  \ I was longing for- excited for, but also hesitant for at the same time.\n \nOnly\
  \ a month ago I had felt that same excitement combined with hesitance when I got\
  \ up in the morning to walk the Tongariro Alpine Crossing. 19.4 kilometres I was\
  \ told, 19.4 kilometres in combination with a 765 meters elevation gain and a 1125\
  \ meters elevation loss. Additionally, the difficulty was labelled as strenuous.\
  \ I knew strenuous was something similar to something actually being difficult,\
  \ but I had to look it up to be sure. \u201CRequiring or using great effort or exertion\u201D\
  , according to a quick Google search.\n \nAlthough I was nervous, I tried to push\
  \ those nerves aside and focus on the prospect of standing on top of a mountain,\
  \ a mountain with a name I could not pronounce. I would be looking down on Mount\
  \ Doom, feeling taller than my actual height. And so, I went. The sun was about\
  \ to rise as I arrived at the starting point of the crossing. Hundreds of people\
  \ gathered around me. Afterwards I learned that I was just one in a thousand that\
  \ day.\n \nOne step after the other we started climbing. The 765 meters elevation\
  \ gain took its toll, but it took me by surprise that it was quite manageable. After\
  \ I don\u2019t actually remember how many hours we were getting close to our goal:\
  \ looking down on Mount Doom.  \n \nThe feeling of complete freedom hit me immediately\
  \ when I arrived at the highest point, the \u200ERed Crater, located at a height\
  \ of 1,886 metres. The thrill and excitement were accompanied by my heart racing\
  \ exponentially. Partially due to the elevation gain but primarily due to the exquisite\
  \ view of New Zealand from a whole new perspective. I had embarked on a rollercoaster\
  \ ride of uninterrupted unexpected experiences. This ride and the feeling of complete\
  \ freedom that came along with it hit me like a breath of fresh air.\n \nBut, the\
  \ cold air in the industrial airport corridors emphasise the reality I am in. I\
  \ couldn\u2019t have predicted walking in this airport, on my way to my family and\
  \ friends, would be more strenuous than walking the Tongariro Alpine Crossing. Right\
  \ now, when I close my eyes, I can no longer imagine the freedom travelling offered\
  \ me. Because there it is again, that strange familiar sound."
