Text: "Everything began in Argentina, but it was more a Leap of faith that eventually\
  \ took me to know the United States and the caribbean. \nI worked for 2 years for\
  \ Royal Caribbean International 3 different contracts as a retail sales associate,\
  \ 4 different ships, from the smallest one to the Mega Class Oasis Ships. I have\
  \ never feel myself this way, going back home and understand I do not belong here,\
  \ citizen of The World who walks (sails) the earth, no Internet plan on cell phone,\
  \ not worry about how much I was earning, just making memories in every place, understanding,\
  \ life is only one and nothing is granted, our body its only a rent for a few years\
  \ before we must give it back.\nOnboard ships you can see it, cultural problem don't\
  \ mean anything, everyone is free of judgments, most of The people living in harmony,\
  \ an experience that everyone should do at least one time to expand their own minds\
  \ and grow as a Human being, without hate, only love, but not the comercial love\
  \ that the songs try to sell to us, or rom\xE1ntic movies, love for everything that\
  \ surrounds you, A food made by your grand mother, the simple hug of your mother,\
  \ or a laugh with your brother. A beer with your Best \"mate\" or a simple talk\
  \ with a stranger.\nI found myself Being a wanderer going back and forth in this\
  \ life and I have seen a lot of good people, a lot of mean and ugly people, nothing\
  \ sells better than bad news, but I know the good acts, despite the people in control\
  \ of The news they do not show them, they are a lot more light than darkness in\
  \ our World.\nBeautiful things don't ask for attention. So good acts don't requiere\
  \ you posting in different social media, o talking about it, just do it whenever\
  \ you feel like it's the right time to do it.\nPart of enjoying life is realice\
  \ that we do not have plenty time on earth so, you might take a Leap of faith in\
  \ doing what you want, because certenly you can fail in what you don't want.\nI\
  \ still have a to much to learn and I'm greatful for the experience I had the chance\
  \ to live and I don't regret anything that I did because in every little thing there\
  \ is teaching to learn, positive and negative things. \nWhenever someone come with\
  \ a problem to me first thing that I make them think is that the only thing doesn't\
  \ have a chance to fix it is Death, the rest of things they have a solution you\
  \ can decide if you are part of the problem or you want the be part of the solution.\n\
  Now it's time of something new for me and why not, for you, the rest... as the people\
  \ say... is history."
