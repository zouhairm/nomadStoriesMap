Text: It was my first time traveling to one of the busiest cities in India,Calcutta.Coming
  from a small town my adrenaline rush to explore a new city had  reached mountains.Initially,I
  experienced a very strange environment.It was when I went out in the evening to
  have a cup of tea on the streets of the city did I see the real beauty of the city.The
  old tram lines and the red old buildings reminded me of the British rule.When you
  first look at the people here,you would feel how busy everyone is with their lives
  and how nobody cares about one another.If looked through a different lens you would
  find that people have stopped living.The work culture has made the lives entangled
  and has erased the idea of actually living.I imagined the city where I could actually
  live and not be one like them.I saw a man who was a foreigner who roamed around
  the streets and was having food with the underprivileged children.He seemed to be
  from a well to do background but what he did back there made me question whether
  we were actually living or merely living. My outlook towards life changed from that
  day onwards .I could see a life where I would not merely live but actually live.
