Text: "Many time I heard different opinions about Spain, really different each other.\
  \ I heard that Spain on beautiful, it's boring it's cheap, it's not cheap at all,\
  \ etc.\nI've never had the interest to see Spain because I'm Italian so I thought\
  \ it wasn't different than my home country but my goal is to travel all over the\
  \ world, to discover different cultures, to live these cultures and to learn from\
  \ them, then obviously to see the beauty of the world. \nLuckily, I had the opportunity\
  \ to go to Spain because I saw really cheap flights so I choose the 2 typical destinations:\
  \ Madrid and Barcelona. \nI've been to Madrid first and I was so impressed because\
  \ I wasn't expecting such a beautiful city. There were 2 things that impressed me\
  \ most: 'El retiro' park because it was a huge park with so many things to see like\
  \ for example el palacio de cristalo (Crystal palace) that I really reccomend you\
  \ too see if you haven't see it yet. And the second thing was 'Plaza de Callao',\
  \ it reminded me an 'old New York' and by night is even better with the lights on.\
  \ I went in a typical Tapas Bar and I was talking with a waiter and he explained\
  \ me that Madrid is a 'human-sized city' because there are not many distances, it's\
  \ not expensive and it's not a stressful city at all even if it's a big city. Then\
  \ from Madrid I went to Barcelona. Well, Barcelona is a city that I reccomend to\
  \ everyone. It's a city that makes you fall in love with it, with the architecture,\
  \ with the life style, with the people, with everything of it. I didn't have high\
  \ expectations if I have to be honest, but I immediately changed my mind. If you\
  \ are in Barcelone, of course, the first thing you want to see is the Sagrada Familia.\
  \ The Sagrada Familia is famous because after more than a century is not finished\
  \ yet. When I saw the Sagrada Familia from the outside I wasn't expecting something\
  \ so magnificent. The modernisme style of the church is impressive and if you have\
  \ time to see it from the inside I really reccomend you to spend few hours there\
  \ because the inside is even better. The Sagrada Family wasn't the only thing that\
  \ impressed me, if you have ever been to Barcelona you know that you must see the\
  \ Barceloneta. The Barceloneta is the beach of Barcelona, if you are looking for\
  \ a quite walk around the beach when it not too busy and too hot to enjoy it properly,\
  \ I reccomend you to go during the morning. It was so peaceful and I could hear\
  \ the sound of the sea. The Barceloneta has the Hotel Vela (sail hotel) and the\
  \ Torre Mapfre that decorate the beach. It's eally nice to have a walk around the\
  \ seafront. I've also walked to the Rambla which is a typical street in central\
  \ Barcelona and it connects Pla\xE7a de Catalunya with the Christopher Columbus\
  \ monument. If you are there I reccomend you to stop by the Boqueria. The Boqueria\
  \ is a typical marker in Barcelona famous for its fresh food like fruit and vegetables\
  \ and for its typical fruit juices. I went to see Casa Batll\xF2 which is a house\
  \ designed by Gaud\xEC, so it's designed by a Modernisme style. It's decorated with\
  \ a colourful mosaic made of broken ceramic tiles. Barcelona is a city that you\
  \ must see,  it makes you want to stay. I have to say I'm glad I went to these 2\
  \ beautiful city, after that I decided to see more around Spain and everytime I\
  \ go back there I fall in love with the landscapes, the food, the people, the sea,\
  \ with everything more and more. I truly reccomend to everyone to visit Spain."
