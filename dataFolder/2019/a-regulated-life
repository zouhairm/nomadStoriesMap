Text: "There was no money on the German card and the car would not be rented to him.\
  \ How many other cards did he have? 1. 2. 3. 4. All hybrids. 247 miles away from\
  \ the destination. 4.90 pounds on the British one. 12.35 on the golden one from\
  \ Poland. PIN forgotten and TAN lost for the German one. No PIN for the WBK one\
  \ either, though a string of 8 digits and 12 alphanumeric characters he did remember\
  \ laid bare the inaccessible 16 euros on it and some Polish zloty. Prosody helped\
  \ remember the singsong of the 16 digits necessary for online access to the DB account;\
  \ that revealed an unexpected lack of funds; the forgotten PIN had no influence\
  \ on the situation. It did help discover that the insurance company overcharged\
  \ him in the accessible 180 days of his banking past. Costs of the security of a\
  \ regulated life. Phone at 7%. International man of poverty.\nTwo possible bus connections;\
  \ change in Dublin or Waterford. Both around 25 pounds said the information desk\
  \ clerk. No, he couldn't be more specific. But changing in Waterford meant a shorter\
  \ distance from the destination, while changing in Dublin meant that failing to\
  \ scrape together enough funds for the second fare, there would still be the 247\
  \ miles to go.\nThere was an hour wait. Heinrich Bo\u0308ll's claims that in order\
  \ to overcome the feeling of isolation, to find a link with a strange city, one\
  \ needs to buy something, no matter how small. A box of matches, a bottle of water.\
  \ Oh, to be able to afford them.\nThe currency exchange office on the airport took\
  \ a charge for the service. 26 pounds in cash, all the money including coins, returned\
  \ 23.90 euros.\nHe took the Waterford bus. 19 euros and no electrical sockets. Phone\
  \ at 1%. Should save for emergency.\nMy son works for the company that does the\
  \ connection with your destination, the driver said. I will call him. There would\
  \ be a bus to his destination an hour after they were set to arrive in Waterford.\
  \ It would cost around 5 euros. No, he didn't know how much exactly.\nWaterford.\
  \ He went to the other bus stop: no timetable, no info. Phone died; umbilical cord\
  \ severed. No coins on the whole enormous, empty parking lot behind the bus shelter.\
  \ Blades of dry grass pushing their way through the tarmac; little stones; broken\
  \ cigarette lighters; a sterile city. Beyond the lot, two huge tug boats moored\
  \ on the river. A man clumsily skipping rope on one of them. 'Give me Venice as\
  \ Ruskin first saw it\u2014without a railway; or give me a speed-boat and the international\
  \ rich,' writes that other Byron, on The Road to Oxiana. Water in the river; icy.\
  \ What was its name? Back to the shelter. An antiquated petrol station transformed\
  \ into a florist's. The warm interior of a deli on the opposite side of the street.\
  \ Sandwiches. Wraps.\nThe bus would have to cross that bridge behind. Come down\
  \ that road. Alert; like a well trained dog. The coach station was closed by then,\
  \ but for the waiting room and the kiosk, selling chocolate bars, crisps, water,\
  \ hot coffee, beef jerky, and possibly sandwiches or even warm paninis. He opened\
  \ his suitcase and took out another sweater. No improvement. At least the shelter\
  \ stopped the ubiquitous drizzle. The international homeless.\nAn hour passed.\n\
  \u201CThat'll be five euros,\u201D said the driver in a foreign accent. Was it his\
  \ own accent as well? Was it not silly of them to communicate in this language,\
  \ foreign to the both of them?\nHe took out his British card.\n\u201CThose don't\
  \ work here\u201D said the driver.\nHe took out all the change from his pocket.\
  \ He said he could call someone at the destination to come and bring the missing\
  \ amount. He lied; the phone was dead. \"Hop on,\u201D said the Driver, \"and don't\
  \ worry about the ten cents.\"\nHe thanked the driver curtly and went inside. The\
  \ air was hot and humid. The moment he sat down in his seat, he fell fast asleep.\
  \ He dreamt of a large mansion with an extensive network of dark caves underneath."
