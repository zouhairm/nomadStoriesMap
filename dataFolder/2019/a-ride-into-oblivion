Text: "I thought I knew Hanoi well. After all, I\u2019ve been to my home country\u2019\
  s capital many times before, once a year to be exact. I was enchanted by the city\
  \ \u2013 with its fascinating thousand-year-old history of kings, scholars and communist\
  \ revolutionaries, its French colonial villas nestling in-between Vietnamese clay-tiled-roof\
  \ houses, its vibrant street culture and its unique cuisine. Thus, I find myself,\
  \ time and again, returning to the city, as it never fails to capture me once more\
  \ with an unexplored facet.\nThat day, my friend \u2013 a proud, almost to the point\
  \ of Hanoi-supremacy, Hanoian \u2013 and I, set out on a day trip to explore Duong\
  \ Lam ancient village in the outskirts of Hanoi, a one-hour motorbike ride from\
  \ the city centre. Though small and relatively unknown, the village packs a punch\
  \ in terms of history and cultural heritage. Recognizing its significance, the government\
  \ provides limited funding for locals to preserve historical sites.\nWe came on\
  \ a cloudy summer day to find a quite and quaint village. Other than us, there were\
  \ only a handful of foreign tourists. The \u2018local tourist information centre\u2019\
  \ was the iced-tea-and-snacks stall in front of the village\u2019s communal house\
  \ \u2013 the heart of any Vietnamese village where villagers would gather to hold\
  \ community events. The lady at the stall enthusiastically offered us tea and guided\
  \ us on what to do and where to go. Hydrated and primed with information, we set\
  \ off. \nDuong Lam has all the typical features of a traditional Northern Vietnamese\
  \ village: a village gate, old banyan tree, village well, communal house, temple\
  \ and rice fields. If you were Vietnamese, all of these would be familiar settings\
  \ in those fables growing up. The village has its fair share of ancient traditional\
  \ houses \u2013 some of the oldest in the country \u2013 which still, to this day,\
  \ serve as home to many. Life carries on easily and humbly there. Besides some signs\
  \ of modern amenities, it almost felt like time had stopped, at hundreds-years ago.\
  \ \nOur exploration of Duong Lam ended around late afternoon with the start of rain\
  \ and a spontaneous suggestion, to go further out to Son Tay Old Fortress, a ten-minute\
  \ ride away. It\u2019s a fortress built in 1822 to protect the northwest of Thang\
  \ Long \u2013 the old name of the capital. So, we went, not really knowing what\
  \ to expect. I imagined it would be an old and formidable military complex, heavy-looking\
  \ and somewhat boring, as it was designed to withstand guns and fire.\nTo our surprise,\
  \ the exterior looked like a park, if you ignore the water-trench surrounding the\
  \ site. The previously reddish-clay laterite walls of the fortress were now a grayish\
  \ color, dotted with green moss. Instead of giving off an imposing feel, the fortress\
  \ conveyed a nostalgic sadness, especially in the light tropical rain. \nThe place\
  \ was nearly empty: two security guards and a few locals exercising. The symbol\
  \ of military aggression of bygone times had shed its toughness and turned peaceful.\
  \ As we walked, the world around grew quieter with each step. By the time we passed\
  \ through the inner gate into the main complex, the noise and haste of the outside\
  \ had completely ceased. \nI looked around and spotted a small group of locals meditating.\
  \ It was as though their tranquility could reach me from afar, enveloping me in\
  \ stillness. My senses suddenly enhanced: I could clearly see the trees and walls\
  \ surrounding, hear the rhythmic pit-pat of rain and taste the sweet lingering of\
  \ the sugarcane juice I just had on tip of my tongue. It\u2019s hard to explain\
  \ such surreal feelings with words, as one has to experience it to understand.\n\
  When we left, I turned and looked back at the fading fortress; the rain seemingly\
  \ formed a bubble protecting it \u2013 a fortress of oblivion. \u201CVroom\u201D\
  , my friend\u2019s motorbike became a time machine, bringing us back into the honking\
  \ of cars and rushing sounds of the present world."
