Text: "I am here in front of a desk thinking and re-thinking to my story, to a possible\
  \ future . Choices, we make choices in our short existence.\n Where I am going to\
  \ ? Is this path good for me ? Is it the right choice that I have made? \nEveveryday,\
  \ every single day I have been asking those little questions. \nMy story begun with\
  \ an experience, an experience called Erasmus. I don't know what has brought me\
  \ here in Germany, but I can say that it has been the scariest and the thrillest\
  \ adventure of my life. \nI don't even know why I decided to move from that comfort\
  \ zone of everyday life. I wanted a change in my life, I was too curious of the\
  \ outer world, though I was also scared, insecure, I don't even know where this\
  \ feet that I have wanted to go, to explore.\nI have experienced life, both light\
  \ and darkness. Alone , with 2 small suitcases in a place unknown to me, \"where\
  \ am I going?\" I asked myself. \"Why  am I doing so?\" I kept asking.\nBut something\
  \ , something stronger guided me along this path, was a faith an inner faith I had\
  \ inside. \nI met extraordinary people along my path, I met limits that I had to\
  \ cross , like a jump into vastnessness. I was insecure though there was even fire,\
  \ fire of life that wanted to come out. \nYeah, that is true, this experience called\
  \ Erasmus has changed my life, my point of view. I want to travel to discover the\
  \ tiniest places in the world. I cannot stay at home, working in  an office for\
  \ 12 hours per day knowing that outside there is a world to be discovered. \nThat\
  \ is my little story, a story like others , but also different.\nMey feet are crossing\
  \ the world, are aiming for life, for the breathtaking view of a landscape very\
  \ early in the morning. This is me, this is life."
