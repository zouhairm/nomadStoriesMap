Text: "104 degree fever. Shit! I look up in disbelieve.  Of course, no one around\
  \ me understood what that meant on my American thermometer.  I pull out my phone\
  \ and swipe through to a downloaded app that could convert it to Celsius.  Oh\u2026\
  This is serious!  She needs medical attention. Now, they understand.  Yes, I need\
  \ to get her to the hospital right away, except I\u2019m in the middle of the African\
  \ desert!  My daughter is sitting in the dirt, too weak to get up and covered in\
  \ vomit.  I go for my med kit.  I\u2019m sure I have it better stocked then most\
  \ of the surrounding village clinics 100 kilometers away.  I have Tylenol and Ibuprofen,\
  \ but what is the schedule?  Oh, I don\u2019t remember it\u2019s been so long. \
  \ One every 6 hours the other every 4 hours, but in what order?  I\u2019m the only\
  \ mother on the tour; I have no one to turn to.   \nLuckily, I pack like a boy scout\
  \ and carried more gear with me than I did clothes.  At that moment, I couldn\u2019\
  t have been more thankful.  I dug out the hammock, got it wet, and hung it between\
  \ two leafless trees.  It was September and early Spring in Namibia. The sun wasn\u2019\
  t even overhead yet and it was already 37 out (that\u2019s 99 degrees for you back\
  \ home). I got her towel and a scarf wet and placed them over her body and forehead.\
  \  At least there was a little breeze. \nI hurried to the reception area of the\
  \ campground and tried to look up the dosage for alternating the fever reducers,\
  \ but the wifi is horrible.  It takes forever to load one page. I shake my phone\
  \ with frustration.  As if it were an Etch-a Sketch and could erase everything that\
  \ was happening right now.  I walk around the campground holding my phone in my\
  \ hand high above my head extending my human antenna. Looking for a spot that I\
  \ can connect and use the data on my local SIM card.  So frustrating.  Social Media.\
  \  Yes, I can connect!  I reach out to a group I belong to on Facebook that is full\
  \ of World Schoolers. I frantically start typing.  I am in Africa.  Her symptoms\
  \ are: high fever and vomiting.  We are in a malaria free zone and she has been\
  \ on the medication.  Right away people are responding to me.  What about this?\
  \  Or, do you really want to take the risk and she dies? Straight forward and no\
  \ beating around the bush.  Then all of my families that have traveled to malaria\
  \ risks zones start chiming in.  It\u2019s the medication.  She is more than likely\
  \ having horrible side effects from the medication that she is taking for the malaria\
  \ prevention.  I spoke with a couple of local guides and they also said that the\
  \ medicine is horrible and makes everyone sick.  The side effects are a bigger risk\
  \ than malaria. They see it all the time, Westerners are always getting sick on\
  \ the medication.  People here get malaria all the time.  It is not deadly.  You\
  \ can treat it.   \nI stood in a daze watching a dust devil kicking up red dirt\
  \ as it scurries across the campground.  Causing havoc in much the same way my mind\
  \ was spinning.  I\u2019m dissecting everything that everyone just told me.  Amazed\
  \ at how easy it is to connect to complete strangers, even in the middle of the\
  \ African desert. That morning, I wondered if bringing my daughter around the world\
  \ would be my greatest mistake.  Now, I stood there and reflected on the highs and\
  \ lows of travelling.  The natural ebbs and flows of this world.  This was no mistake.\
  \  This is what I signed up for."
