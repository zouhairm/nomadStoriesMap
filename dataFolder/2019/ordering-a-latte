Text: "It\u2019s cold, It\u2019s mid-morning, my headache is pounding from last night\u2019\
  s adventure, and I can\u2019t believe where I am. I stand on the wooden structure\
  \ of the Ponte dell'Accademia (Academy Bridge) in the historic Italian city of Venice,\
  \ looking over the bustling boat filled Grand Canal below. Who hasn\u2019t dreamed\
  \ of watching over the floating waters of the twisting canals and small stilted\
  \ islands? My breath was taken away. There existing before me was unspeakable beauty\
  \ and pure amazement of how it is all still here, after thousands of years. I let\
  \ the winter sun, shine on my face and took the last few minutes in completely.\
  \  \n\nMoments before standing there reflecting, something so unexpected was experienced,\
  \ all thanks to one thing,  my coffee fix. I was fully aware that I was in Italy,\
  \ famous for their espresso's and cappuccino's and I was desperate for a coffee\
  \ after not being able to find a decent one in the past few days. The Starbucks's\
  \ I saw was tempting, but that would have been unacceptable for me as a self-proclaimed\
  \ connoisseur of coffee. \n\nI was grabbed by the arm \"What about that little place?\"\
  \ my friend asked as he started to pull me towards the direction he was pointing\
  \ in. We had been allowed a few minutes where we could go exploring, before venturing\
  \ further and onto the bridge. \n\nJust passed the steps to the bridge, a small\
  \ black door with a simple little window design was set into the terracotta coloured\
  \ stone wall of connected buildings. It was a little bar, that displayed the little\
  \ chalk a-frame reading 'Cappucino's'. \n\nWe walked in to see a young man, an older\
  \ lady and a customer conversing in fast Italian. My primary school level was instantly\
  \ useless to me I thought. The little ding of the doors bell when we stepped in\
  \ had made them aware of us, and they greeted us with warm welcoming smiles and\
  \ a simple 'Buongiorno' (good morning) from what seemed like the Nonna. \n\nOrdering\
  \ a latte, we attempted to converse with them, in broken Italian and English. My\
  \ minimal Italian managed to help a little after all. They wondered where we were\
  \ from and how we were enjoying it so far. It was so surreal being in this beautiful\
  \ small cafe bar, conversing with the locals. It felt like home in a way. They were\
  \ asking where we were from, what our plans were for the day, how we were liking\
  \ it and little random things that seemed only natural to answer with a smile. \n\
  \nSipping at the latte, I was floating. The flavour was so perfect and smooth. \
  \ It is and will forever be the best coffee I have ever had. It wasn't just the\
  \ flavour but also the time, the place and the people I was with then and there\
  \ that made it so unforgettable. \n\nI think back now, and I can see this is one\
  \ of the most magical experiences of my life so far. I had never thought that in\
  \ a small little cafe, in this small part of Europe, filled with excitement, and\
  \ possibly still alcohol, that I would have a moment so unexpected like this. Going\
  \ into this small random little shop on a sudden whim made me realise, it's not\
  \ the big touristy places that you need to always make a priority of, it is the\
  \ random places that can have you treasure such an unexpected moment forever."
