Text: "Sleepwalking through the routine life, a visit to Himachal Pradesh after five\
  \ long years felt like a breath of fresh air. As a prisoner of the urban jungle\
  \ who has been released into the lap of the living Gods - the mighty Himalayas,\
  \ I eagerly drank in the beautiful sights and ethereal vibes of the mountains. I\
  \ arrived in Kalpa in the late afternoon, and a delicious meal was mandatory for\
  \ the required energy to explore the place on foot. Kalpa is a small paradise in\
  \ the Kinnaur district of Himachal, nestled amidst apple orchards & snow clad peaks\
  \ of the Kinnaur-Kailash range, where Hinduism & Buddhism coexist. The Buddhist\
  \ flags fluttering in the wind could be seen from my hotel, pulling my feet in that\
  \ direction. Following the trail, I ended up at the Buddhist temple, and imitated\
  \ the old lady there, rotating the prayer wheels and offering my prayers. \n\nA\
  \ few girls interacting next to the temple caught my attention, upon going closer\
  \ I realised it was a Balika Ashram (girls hostel). Without further ado, I went\
  \ up and spoke to the concerned authorities requesting permission to click photos.\
  \ Just when I thought my prayers were answered at the drop of a hat, my thought\
  \ was followed by an arduous process of convincing, showing my portfolio, talking\
  \ about my credentials, and my career in education. A role reversal seemed to be\
  \ at play, whereby I felt like a student being questioned by my teachers. With some\
  \ hesitation and after entering the required details, I passed the examination &\
  \ was given a green signal to carry out my shoot. \n\nAfter the first round of questioning,\
  \ the next round of questions was initiated by the girls, curious about my presence\
  \ and purpose of visit. The young girls were running around between the study area\
  \ and their dorms, gathering their books for the study hour. They were fumbling\
  \ about in their bags, looking for their pencils, and after a few minutes they finally\
  \ settled down into their seats. At the heart of all activities were the backbenchers\
  \ who were thoroughly enjoying themselves, except for the two girls who continued\
  \ to write unaffected by the distractions around them. The girls were of varied\
  \ age groups, with the young ones seated in the front and the older ones seated\
  \ in the middle and back of the study area. From soft murmurs to loud jabbering,\
  \ the room resonated with charged energy.\n\nAnkita was the first girl I interacted\
  \ with, she was studying chemistry - her favourite subject. She had done her hair\
  \ in pigtails and the look of concentration on her face as she was writing away\
  \ in her notebook impervious to the noises, along with the ray of light falling\
  \ on her, made that very moment nostalgic - bringing back identical memories of\
  \ my time in school. She glanced inquisitively at me before asking my name, following\
  \ which we spent a few minutes exchanging stories about our lives, daily schedules\
  \ and favourite subjects. \n\nMeanwhile, the mischievous lot at the back appeared\
  \ to be pro at multitasking - from playing with balloons, narrating the day\u2019\
  s stories to each other to cracking jokes, they did it all besides the required\
  \ study. They distracted the younger girls as well encouraging them to play the\
  \ game, continuing to be in their element unfazed by my presence. Manju was exuberant\
  \ of them all, and her deep booming laughter reverberated around the room. Her witty\
  \ one-liners and quick responses to statements were a hit, and being serious around\
  \ her was a task. However, this moment was short-lived. Hearing the noise decibel\
  \ go up, the teachers came to the study area and scolded the girls - \u201Cpadhai\
  \ karo!\u201D (study!). The girls giggled quietly before going back to their work\
  \ while the teachers were around, internally waiting for the hour to end. \n\nIn\
  \ between the locals of Himachal and breathtaking landscapes that greet your eyes,\
  \ I often find myself drawn to the alleyways leading unto schools. It is here that\
  \ the purest hearts reside, filling your heart with unadulterated joy and a memory\
  \ card with unforgettable moments."
