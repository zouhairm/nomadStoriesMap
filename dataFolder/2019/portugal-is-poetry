Text: "In November 2018, I visited Porto. I finally arrived to my soul city. In February\
  \ 2019, I went back to Lisbon. Now I can conclusively say, that Portugal and I are\
  \ in a relationship. Portugal has a vocabulary of its own that I know for a fact,\
  \ would require more visits to understand, to comprehend. The lyrical landscapes,\
  \ the provocative nostalgia, the history, people, art, fragrances, sights, which\
  \ is invoking some kind of familiarity. Like meeting an old lover, who, at some\
  \ point in time you had known better than your soul, but with so much water that\
  \ has flown under the bridge, you are known strangers, strange soulmates.\nI didn\u2019\
  t expect to have the rug swept off her feet while visiting this country. I had known\
  \ about its existence, I had read about it, but I had not expected such a heady\
  \ impact. I didn\u2019t expect to find MYSELF by loosing my senses, my orientation,\
  \ unlearning things that I thought I knew so well. This is where I know, that I\
  \ need to learn about all things Portugal, I need to learn to see, feel and say,\
  \ to articulate. There are points in time where you want to put all your life so\
  \ far, thoughts and deeds included, in a grinder, and with that dough, make a new\
  \ self. Portugal did that to me. It had made me want to go to the same place and\
  \ see the same thing differently. The power of Portugal on me is liberating and\
  \ stifling at the same time. I am at a point where words fail me and I know where\
  \ to go to look for them.\nI need to go to a place that is old and new at the same\
  \ time. That has oceans and mountains. That has a river, some wine, has musical\
  \ winters and inebriated summers, a place that embraces people, that romances language,\
  \ that is compact yet profound."
