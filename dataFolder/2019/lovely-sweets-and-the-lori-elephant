Text: "Having worked the past 14 days straight, I was in dire need to leave the premises\
  \ and see something, anything. As it turned out, today was Lori, a joyous winter\
  \ harvest festival celebrated in Punjab, complete with bonfires to mark the passing\
  \ of the winter solstice, together with lots of feasting, singing and kite flying.\
  \ It seemed quite appropriate then to try and witness such festivities before heading\
  \ to Lovely Sweets, as I\u2019d been told I could not leave Jalandhar until I\u2019\
  d visited this institution. Lovely Sweets was founded in 1961 by Baldev Raj Mittal\
  \ who initially set up shop selling ladoos, which are very high calorific balls\
  \ made of flour, ghee/butter/oil and sugar with any number of flavours and other\
  \ ingredients such as chopped nuts and fried frutis.\n\nAfter a very lazy morning,\
  \ I set out from the hotel heading north, past all the mechanics and tyre stores\
  \ and the odd derelict building, to the back entrance of the Nehru Gardens. Unfortunately\
  \ no kites were seen at all amidst the immaculate landscaped surrounds.  Having\
  \ initially misplaced the side entrance, I completed 1.5 laps before exiting and\
  \ went out the front entrance on to the busy Jalandhar Cantt - Jandiala Rd.  I then\
  \ headed west along the bustling GT Rd with its possibly hundreds of shoe stalls\
  \ before I got to Jyoti Chowk, which appears to be the confluence of central Jalandhar\
  \ and the major bazaars.  Turning left on to the Jalandhar - Nakodar Rd, I sneakily\
  \ snapped photos here and there with my usual photo-taking scowl, avoiding eye contact\
  \ so as to evade any unwanted attention from annoyed people who were begrudgingly\
  \ being photographed.\n\nI arrived at Lovely Sweets which was easy to spot given\
  \ the small crowd outside the store which I believe is one of the flagship branches\
  \ although not the initial one. A small flight of stairs heading downward revealed\
  \ a humid store crammed full of people and sweets everywhere, stacked up and behind\
  \ counters. Not having the foggiest, I explored it all, then examined a few gift\
  \ boxes before I summoned an assistant for help. After some miscommunication, it\
  \ was deemed I was indeed searching for ladoos, and so I decided to go for a mixed\
  \ box from the brightly coloured assortment behind one of the counters. By then\
  \ I was profusely sweating given how many customers there were; all wearing their\
  \ winter clothes despite the weather outside being quite mild.  After my box was\
  \ prepared, the assistant twice calculated the total price for me in a round-about\
  \ way, before escorting me to the cashier and then even went to find a carry bag\
  \ for the ornately decorated box. All-in-all he provided exceptional customer service\
  \ and I gleefully left Lovely Sweets like a happy child departing a candy store.\n\
  \nBack at the hotel, I shared some of the sweets with co-workers before going for\
  \ an after work stroll to one of the nearby local parks to see if there was any\
  \ Lori jolliness happening. Indeed there was with a sizable tent and and bright\
  \ kites tied to the overhead beams along with a small bonfire near what appeared\
  \ to be a makeshift kitchen.  However, it was evident the party wasn\u2019t starting\
  \ for some time so my coworker and I returned, strolling along the dark, pot-holed\
  \ streets .  As we were about to step inside the hotel, we heard music and discovered\
  \ a colourfully painted elephant was ambling down the road.  Never one to miss a\
  \ photo opportunity, we handed over a small fee and I tentatively posed for selfies\
  \ while nervously touching the rough, grey trunk and recalling reading a story about\
  \ an elephant that had gone on a rampage days earlier.  \n\nA happy Lori to all!"
