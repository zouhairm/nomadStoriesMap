Text: "It was a sense of belonging, and a realization that I am, at this moment, standing\
  \ at the Brink of Britain. \nBrighton, I've met a man, an artist; A Tibetan who\
  \ came to Brighton twenty years ago with the dream of being a photographer and now\
  \ his daughter, too, was a photographer. This man told me he loved to ride his bike\
  \ out here with his homemade lunch, and just watch the sea. We were both on a deserted\
  \ space far out of the beach, tides were coming in, he merely stared out at the\
  \ sunset.\n    I liked to think he was remembering his first steps on this beautiful\
  \ island; I liked to imagine him back in time, holding his bentos, hot ramen noodles\
  \ fogging up his glasses. Every bite tasted like home,  but not quiet. But that\
  \ was alright, he was chasing his dream, somewhere far away.\n    London was an\
  \ exhilarating place, just crossing the streets and looking at all the people rushing\
  \ by, it felt like I was inhaling freedom!  I came here, mind set on seeing the\
  \ London eye, London bridge, but what I've earned in return were many stories from\
  \ people all over the world. We were not divided by countries here, we were all\
  \ simply earthlings, brought together by this country!"
