Text: "GOA! Adventure, beaches, seafood, casino, water-sport, clubs, riding, natural\
  \ beauty, Goa is the combination of all these things. Goa is one of the popular\
  \ travel destination for couples and youngsters and singles as well. Goa is famous\
  \ for its nightlife as well, which is listed as sixth best night life destination\
  \ by  National Geographic. \n \nAs I have completed my exam and all of my friends\
  \ including me badly needed a holiday for some refreshment and to spent some free\
  \ time with each other, to escape the daily routine for some time, needed time fo\
  \ us for ourselves, so we decided to travel to Goa. And we decided to travel the\
  \ distance via the most adventurous way, i.e road trip.\n\nOn August 21, we started\
  \ our journey from Indore to Goa via Pune. We were five and luckily everyone of\
  \ us know how to drive the car, so all of us drove the car one by one so that no\
  \ one feel restless, and enjoy the trip. After a 11 hours of driving we finally\
  \ reached our destination which is approx. 1100kms from our city Indore, but the\
  \ road trip was amazing, we enjoyed the road and saw a lot of beautiful places in\
  \ the mid of our journey form Indore to Goa. We stayed there in an apartment which\
  \ we had booked earlier with the help of OYO, and which is located near Dona Paula\
  \ Beach,Goa, which is going to be our stay for the next 2 days in Goa.\n\nThe very\
  \ next day after getting breakfast and getting ready, we leave our place and went\
  \ out to look out for the city , then we took scooties (they also lend cars & bikes)\
  \ from there which is easily available to one who have a driving license. The rent\
  \ for a scooty is about Rs. 300-350 per day, Rs. 800 for an Enfield bike whereas\
  \ Rs. 1200-1400 for a car. Goa has a number of beaches but, Colangute and Bagha\
  \ beaches are preferred by most of the travellers. After looking few of the beaches\
  \ we went for the shopping in Goa, street market of Goa is very famous for cheap\
  \ and beautiful ornamentes as well as clothes, after some shopping we returned back\
  \ to our apartment for getting ready to go to the night club. There are many night\
  \ clubs and discs in Goa. Club Cabana, Mambo's, Tito's, and Curlies are some of\
  \ the most famous. Curlies was mostly crowded by Russians, we enjoyed and danced\
  \ a lot on the dance floor, after spending few hours in club with drinks, starters\
  \ and dance we all started feeling very hungry, so we rushed to a hotel near by\
  \ club to eat some food and then returned back to our apartment nearby 1 at night,\
  \ we all were so restless but at the same time very enthusiastic for the next day.\
  \ \n\nThe very next day was Goa carnival. It was my first experience of the carnival.\
  \ The crowd was so dense during the procession that we were not able to stand properly\
  \ even for 2-3 minutes. Hence we decided to returned to beach, apart from natural\
  \ beauty of beaches, water sports are also much attracting part of Goa. We enjoyed\
  \ parasailing, water skating, and banana riding and many more. \n\nThe cuisine of\
  \ Goa was our next venture. The Goan Food  has its own speciality,  the Goan cuisine\
  \ comprises Italian, Russian, Portuguese, English, France and Thai dishes. \n\n\
  We  found the Central Jail of Goa, a home of prisoners, while roaming around,  we\
  \ also saw Se Cathedral and Shri Mangueshi Temple, there were many more things remained\
  \ to see but as this was our last day in Goa so we tried to cover as many as places\
  \ we can. After looking all those places and had dinner, we returned back to apartment.\n\
  \nMy overall Goa trip is a fabulous experience. Because of the shortage of time\
  \ we left so many places so I would love to visit Goa for the second time. Goa is\
  \ a must visit, at least once in a lifetime. I am sure, you'll never forget."
