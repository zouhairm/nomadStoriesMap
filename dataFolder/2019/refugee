Text: "Turkish lanterns and byzantine rugs hung on both sides of the alleys at the\
  \ bazaar. Tea aromas filled up the air; ground spices are displayed in shape of\
  \ pyramids and delicate confections are molded like domes reminiscent of local mosques\u2019\
  \ structures. An echo rose from outside. The Asr \u2013 third Muslim daily prayer\
  \ recited in the afternoon - commenced. \nBashar al-Assad\u2019s bombs, gas and\
  \ military attacks may be miles away from his shop, but in Adbel\u2019s memory,\
  \ they live as if they happened yesterday. \n-German, British? he shouted to invite\
  \ me in.\n-American, I replied.\nIn Antalya, German and British tourists are more\
  \ common than Americans.\n-Come in Madame! He smiled, welcoming me in.\nI hesitate,\
  \ thinking there are plenty of other stores I would like to see.\n-Please look,\
  \ I have the best rugs, I trimmed each thread perfectly. Each lantern I inspect\
  \ to ensure that no bead is missing, and I have ceramic bowls too\u2026\nHe really\
  \ has a special attention to details, I observed. The store, neatly arranged shows\
  \ a reverence for his craft, a pride of his culture and religion; a shrine to his\
  \ past.\nHow Abdel became a seller at a bazaar in Antalya is a story worthy of a\
  \ movie. He grew up about fifteen miles south of Aleppo at a time when Syria was\
  \ known more for its rich history rather than a headline in the news. After high\
  \ school, he started teaching at an elementary school while advancing his education.\
  \ Over the years he split his days between selling custom-made pottery and teaching.\
  \ And it was there, at that school where he enjoyed seeing his students learn and\
  \ play that Abdel lived his best and worst moments. \nIt felt like an earthquake,\
  \ but it was not. The earth did shake, but from stimuli falling from the sky, not\
  \ from underground movement. Abdel\u2019s voice weakens as he speaks of that moment.\
  \ First it was the nearby pharmacy, then his school. There was a siren, a cacophony!\
  \ Walls were falling, kids were screaming, mothers cried for help. Mothers! What\
  \ about his own mother? Abdel ran home, or what was left of it. His mother was standing\
  \ next to a pile of rubble, waiting, suitcases packed. Without saying a word, they\
  \ both knew it was time, time to leave. \nThere were days of walking under the sun\
  \ until their feet swell. Nights of staying up to watch out for thieves. Moments\
  \ of helping others find their way out. And finally, after nine months of seeing\
  \ doors opening and closing in their faces, Abdel and his mother were at last in\
  \ Izmir then Antalya. With over three million refugees, Turkey is currently the\
  \ largest host of displaced people; enough to form an entire new nation on its own.\
  \ \nDuring our talk, Abdel helped me customize a lamp and decorate a bowl that I\
  \ was interested in. He corrected every little imperfection, just like a teacher.\
  \ Still there was one question, that was burning to come out as I kept glancing\
  \ at a family portrait on the shelf in a corner. Where is everyone else? Before\
  \ it became just him and his mother.\nI decided not to ask that question. I did\
  \ not want to hear what I already knew. I accepted, just like Abdel had to accept\
  \ that he is now a refugee. \nAccepting that your hobby becomes your profession\
  \ and the profession becomes your hobby, foreign country becomes home, home becomes\
  \ a memory, there is nothing to go back to; that\u2019s how you become a refugee!"
