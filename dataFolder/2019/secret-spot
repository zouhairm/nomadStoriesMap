Text: "There were no waves to ride in Cloud 9.  Standing on the wooden view deck of\
  \ Siargao\u2019s prime surf break and the world\u2019s 8th best surfing spot, there\
  \ was only a calm flatness on the beach to the left, and a non-rhythmic splash of\
  \ disorganized waves on the shallow reef to the right.  Disappointed but not disheartened,\
  \ my friend and I went down the tower, marched through the boardwalk with the determination\
  \ to find the next best thing the tropical island has to offer.\n\nRented surfboards\
  \ side-mounted to our motorbike, we drove southwest through the paved highway. \
  \ \u201CJust look for parked bikes\u201D, the locals recommended. Half an hour later,\
  \ there it was, a string of five motorcycles with empty surf racks on one side of\
  \ the road.  Across the highway was a plantation, thick with lines of coconut trees\
  \ and a sign, \u201CNO TRESPASSING PRIVATE PROPERTY\u201D, in black bold letters.\n\
  \nWe followed the worn out path of grass flattened by barefoot surfers and soil\
  \ soaked by dripping boards. With the combined weight of the longboards and the\
  \ apprehension of breaking into someone\u2019s backyard over our heads, we balanced\
  \ our way through the muddy slopes. The smell of coconut oil and smoke from drying\
  \ copra mixed slowly with the salty sea breeze.  As the coconut trees thinned out,\
  \ an unassuming white sand cove opened up with combed waves, swelling and breaking\
  \ perfectly to the shore.\n\nA nipa hut stood in the middle, separating the edge\
  \ of the plantation and the beach front.  Hanging from its roof was a marker made\
  \ of cowry shells glued to a wooden board with faded white paint. \u201CSecret Spot\u201D\
  , the sea shells spelled.  There was a smaller handwritten sign inside the hut,\
  \ \u201CBaggage: 20 pesos\u201D. A tall lanky man, tanned and aged by hard work,\
  \ waited at the table in the hut.  We left our dry bag with him and carelessly ran\
  \ off to the long-awaited Siargao waves.\n\nA couple of stoked rides after, I crashed\
  \ and hit my face with the surfboard.  Three pre-adolescent girls ran towards me\
  \ as I paddled my way back to shore.  \u201CAte (older sister), are you ok?\u201D\
  , they said in Bisaya, their language in Siargao.  Beverlyn, Annajean, and Maryrose\
  \ checked my face with bright eyes and worried expressions.  They concurred that\
  \ it was just a minor injury and reassuringly advised me to gargle salt water and\
  \ to apply pressure over my swollen lip.  A doctor by profession, it was refreshing\
  \ to receive sound medical advice and be cared for by a bunch of sincerely concerned\
  \ teens.  I thanked them heartily and listened to their animated conversations as\
  \ I press on my lip.  In between their stories, they pointed anxiously to a couple\
  \ of oblivious tourists getting coconuts at the far end of the cove.\n\nBenched\
  \ by recent events, I sat inside the hut with Kuya (older brother) Romy as we watched\
  \ the other surfers play on.  He spoke Tagalog fluently, the language used by Filipinos\
  \ from Manila and most parts of northern Philippines.  He used to work as a driver\
  \ in the capital, he explained, and was away from his family for more than a decade.\
  \  As tourism grew in the island, he seized the opportunity to go back home.  He\
  \ owns the land by the beach, but not the coconut plantation by the road, which\
  \ is the only way to access the Secret Spot.  A humble landowner, he was not comfortable\
  \ charging entrance fees from tourists, even with the constant need to earn for\
  \ his family.  The bag storage hut was his compromise, at least he was offering\
  \ some sort of service to the surfers.  There have been countless offers from entrepreneurial\
  \ locals and foreigners to buy his property.  But Kuya Romy strongly holds on to\
  \ his principles and believes that this small piece of Siargao, passed down by his\
  \ family through generations, can never be replaced. \n\nThe coconut trees' shadows\
  \ were getting longer, and we had to return the boards to Cloud 9.   I stood up\
  \ and handed the 20 pesos due for our bags.  Kuya Romy adamantly refused to accept\
  \ the cash and smiled gratefully as if sending off a guest he warmly welcomed into\
  \ his home."
