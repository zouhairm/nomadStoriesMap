Text: "My old man travelled when he was my age as he describes it \u2018with a surfboard\
  \ under one arm, a toothbrush in his back pocket, and a change of undies in his\
  \ other back pocket.\u2019\nWhile my travels are comparative luxury, we still often\
  \ get by with bare bones and wallets, but one of the biggest differences I can see\
  \ is that technology allows us to have a much greater efficiency of experiences,\
  \ with significantly less planning.\nThis brings me to the title of our joint Instagram\
  \ handle: @oopsadventures.\nWe book everything at the last possible second. \nMy\
  \ guess is it\u2019s a 60-40 split between \u2018oops\u2019 and \u2018lucky\u2019\
  . \nBut I wouldn\u2019t have it any other way.\n\nSome examples of this include\
  \ going to Santorini in Winter \u2013 where the biggest storm they recorded in the\
  \ last ten years almost blew us back to Athens, and the only place that was open\
  \ was a takeaway gyros place. Still we managed to go there for breakfast, lunch,\
  \ and dinner, and have an alright time. Oops.\nBut in complete contrast, against\
  \ all TripAdvisor articles, the leaning tower of Pisa which was reported to be hours\
  \ of cueing mindlessly while attempt to angle a selfie so that the tower lands exactly\
  \ in front of their penis, instead we were welcomed to literally walking straight\
  \ in and up to the beautiful views, and extending our visit as long as we pleased.\
  \ \nLucky.\n\nOne of our more infamous \u2018Oopses\u2019 involved everyone\u2019\
  s least favourite airways \u2018Ryanair\u2019 \u2013 a company who align most with\
  \ our empty wallets and questionable optimism.\n\nPouncing on the \u2018Boxing day\
  \ sales\u2019 and actually booking a few weeks in advance for once, Alex Giles and\
  \ Kim Smith booked a one-way to Morroco for 5th Jan and a return Edinburgh to London\
  \ Jan 25th, with the intention to fill the gaps in between.\n\n5 pounds per person,\
  \ per flight.\nLucky!\n\nUnfortunately, Alex Smith appeared on the booking instead\
  \ of Alex Giles.\nOops.\nUnfortunately, we realised this the exact night before\
  \ upon trying to check in.\nOops.\nHere\u2019s some fun facts about Ryanair.\n\n\
  $20 to change your name if you call ahead 9-5 mon-fri\n$110 to check in at the airport\n\
  \nBeing midnight the night before we fly out, and unable to go for the 10 pound\
  \ option, we decided it best for Alex Smith to try and change his name to Giles\
  \ at the desk, hoping for pity and the waiving of the \u2018changing your name at\
  \ the desk\u2019 fee.\n\n+ $155 (Pounds) to change your name at the desk.\n\nOops.\n\
  Plus \u2013 the time queuing meant we\u2019ve BOTH missed our check-in.\n\n+ $220\
  \ in-airport-check-in fees\n\nNow we\u2019re talking more than $500 Australian to\
  \ pay on top of our $10 Aussie dollar tix to Marrakesh.\nOops.\n\nGuess what? It\u2019\
  s $40 to officially change your name by depol. \nAwesome solution\u2026for future\
  \ reference.\n\nWe schmoozed the checkout sheila \u2018Maria\u2019 into waiving\
  \ the manual checkin fee, as we were only over by a couple of minutes, and believe\
  \ me, the Aussie accent and a little bit of fair-dinkum charisma can always swing\
  \ a favour. \n\nSo Kim and Alex Smith were both checked in \u2013 despite Alex Giles\
  \ needing to hand across his passport.\n\nBut we\u2019ve done a fair slog of travelling\
  \ through Europe recently and we\u2019re pretty up to date with how various airports\
  \ run things. Particularly our least favourite (Stanstead, England. Which is nowhere\
  \ near London.)\n\nYou Scan your passport to get through to the gates.\nYou hand\
  \ your passport to the person when you board the plane.\nThe only time they\u2019\
  re going to potentially see the wrong name is when you hand them your phone with\
  \ the QR Code ready and they scan it before you board.\n\nPlus, if you time it just\
  \ right, the boarding staff will be inundated with other frustrated Ryanair customers\
  \ and not bother to be too precise with double checking passport names against tickers.\n\
  \nErgo; Kim and Alex Smith boarded the plane, and Alex Giles, we suppose, never\
  \ left England.\n\nWorth the risk of landing in Marrakesh with illegitimate identity\
  \ documents?\nI\u2019ll let you decide.\n\nBut I\u2019d say it\u2019s roughly 40-60."
