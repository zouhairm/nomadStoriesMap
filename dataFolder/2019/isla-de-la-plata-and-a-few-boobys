Text: "Puerto Lopez, Ecuador is a hive and hum of a fish market and fishing boat activity.\
  \ It is from here that you will start your trip to Isla de la Plata, an island off\
  \ the coast of Ecuador.\nAn hour journey by boat and we reached Isla de la Plata.\
  \ On the shore and after washing the sand from our feet in the provided pool beds,\
  \ we rejoined our guides and were given the do\u2019s and don\u2019ts, etc. The\
  \ first few yards was a gradual incline (it was a baking hot day), and then an 800m\
  \ steep incline of steps met us face to face. We stopped several times to catch\
  \ our breath. \n\nWe opted for the second shortest hike at 3.6kms. At the resting\
  \ point before walking the hike, we met our first Blue-Footed Booby. A mother with\
  \ her young chick that was only about three weeks old, it was so cute.\nA little\
  \ info about the island - it was named in 1579 after Sir Francis Drake who successfully\
  \ looted a Spanish treasure ship called \u201CNuestra Se\xF1ora de la Concepci\xF3\
  n,\u201D popularly known as \u201CCacafuego.\u201D He brought the stolen gold, silver,\
  \ and other goods to Isla de la Plata to split the treasure among him and his men.\
  \ Isla de la Plata means \u201CIsland of the Silver.\u201D\n\nThe vegetation looked\
  \ dead and lifeless, during the rainy season from mid-December to May it becomes\
  \ a lush green mountain. But amazingly the plants and trees are so well adapted\
  \ that their roots go so deep they can sustain themselves during these drought conditions.\
  \ \nThe island is the breeding ground for the Blue-Footed Booby. Once the chicks\
  \ are independent, the parents leave the island and will only return when it is\
  \ mating/breeding season again. They are monogamous but do sometimes become bigamous.\
  \ The birds mostly lay two eggs although there have been three on rare occasions.\
  \ The chicks will only fly when they are about three months old, and they only get\
  \ their blue feet when they are two years old. Both parents take responsibility\
  \ for nesting and feeding and will sometimes help out with another nest but never\
  \ more than two nests at a time. These Blue-Footed Booby\u2019s don\u2019t bother\
  \ to nest in the protection of the vegetation; we walked past so many along the\
  \ hiking trails; they are quite tame but in saying that I would strongly advise\
  \ against anyone trying to touch them!\nAmong the Blue-Footed Booby\u2019s are many\
  \ different bird species; the Frigate is very dominant here. We came across a bush\
  \ singing \u2013 there was a Mockingbird somewhere in it singing to attract its\
  \ mate, sadly we couldn\u2019t find it. Some of the men whistled to it hoping it\
  \ would whistle back to them \u2013 it didn\u2019t; clearly, they were not its choice\
  \ of mate.\nThe view from the island is exquisite the still untouched shores are\
  \ unfortunately dotted here and there with litter from the fishing boats in the\
  \ area. I was very pleased that the nature conservation keeps the island untouched,\
  \ and of their fiercely maintained protection of the bird life on the island. The\
  \ Albatross was almost extinct in this region at one stage thanks to the fisherman\
  \ that used the babies for their oil. And now the Albatross are well protected,\
  \ even the hiking trails to their breeding areas are closed to the public.\nBack\
  \ on our boat and treated to sandwiches, watermelon and pineapple, and the inevitable\
  \ Coke. While we were having lunch Turtles swam to the boat expecting their share\
  \ of the pineapples, the guides duly obliged giving us the opportunity to view these\
  \ amazing creatures up close. \nSlowly they cruised around the corner to another\
  \ bay where we did a bit of snorkeling and viewed beautifully colored fish and coral\
  \ reefs. Back on the boat again, we were very privileged to witness Manta Rays jumping\
  \ out of the ocean, such a spectacular sight to behold and one that I am so grateful\
  \ to have seen. \nYou cannot go to Ecuador and not visit Isla de la Plata; your\
  \ visit to the country is only complete once you have been there and seen a few\
  \ Blue-Footed Boobys."
