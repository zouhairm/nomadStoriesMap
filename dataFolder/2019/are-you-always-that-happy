Text: ",,Are you always that happy?\"\n,,No, no actually not. In fact I'm questionening\
  \ the sense of life since...a long time.  But you make me happy. Truly happy.\"\n\
  Girl meets boy at a party. A friend introduce them to each other. They talk...and\
  \ for the first time for a while she feels an enjoyment again in a conversation.\
  \ He's cute eventhough he's married. Very well, it's a little bit disapointing,\
  \ because he's really cute and nice, but ok just the feeling he gives her is exciting\
  \ and so pleasing. This feeling of beeing alive again.\nBut wait a second he wants\
  \ to go for a coffee with her? Well..why not..\nHe's from Russia and she's from\
  \ Austria. Their friendship starts and it's the begining of something beautiful.\
  \ She knows that he has to go back to moscow, but he hopes to come back together\
  \ with his wife to work and live in Vienna. \nThey start to meet every day, they\
  \ talk for hours and always this thrilling tension in the air. A smile here, a touch\
  \ there. His beautiful, bright smile. Still there is so much pain in his eyes. Guilt.\
  \ \nShe breaks the tension one evening in this cafe,  she can hardly pass now.\n\
  ,,Sometimes I wish you wouldn't be married\"\nA long silence ,,Me too\". \nThey\
  \ walk in silence to the tram to say goodbye. A misguided  try to kiss her, instead\
  \ he kisses her ear. For that she loves him even more. \nWhere are the boundaries?\
  \ Did they already overstep the line? \nThey meet again, this time a kiss lips on\
  \ lips. It's explosive magic. \nFrom then on Responsibility and logic doesn't exist\
  \ anymore. They hold each other in arms irresponsible, knowing that this is never\
  \ going to work out. One week full of blind madness until he has to go back to russia.\
  \ To his wife.\n,,My russian love!\" ,,My austrian love!\"\nPhone calls via Whats\
  \ App. Messages via Messenger. Promises of coming back together.\n,,I didn't expect\
  \ to find someone like you here in Austria, so deep and beautiful.\".\n,,I didn't\
  \ expect to find this feeling of happiness again...maybe a happiness I felt for\
  \ the very first time.\"\nSo sweet and romantic words on both sides. Unfortunately\
  \ life isn't a romantic movie. This storry isn't having a happy end. It's what life\
  \ is, full of pain and sad moments but also full of enjoyment, love and tingles"
