Text: '''''Tomorrow''s weather seems perfect for our picnic, I can''t wait!'' ''I
  exclaimed to my husband of nearly 5 years. We slept and got up at exactly 6am, loaded
  the car and took the 1 hour drive to Cape Point Reserve.

  The air smelled heady and fresh as I exited  car, took a few gulps of water and
  stared up at the steps leading up to our picnic. Who knew that a hike would be inoder
  to get to our picnic destination? Luckily it''s only 20minutes walk, a steep walk
  with twists and turns with little ghekkos coming to say ''''Hi'''' at such opportune
  moments. Oh, but when you get the view of our picnic spot, which is called Diaz
  Beach. It''s all worth it. The bluest of blue waters greet you, the air is crisp
  and oh, wait. You need to go down over 8set of stairs to return to it. Once you
  completed the stairs, onto a massive sand dune, and at last the water is infront
  of you with massive mountain looking rocks, sea filled air and a gentle breeze.
  You can''t swim here due to rip currents, but you do wet your feet, sit on your
  blanket and just melt any stresses away. Just a picnic? No. This is pure heaven
  and it''s just the two of us.'
