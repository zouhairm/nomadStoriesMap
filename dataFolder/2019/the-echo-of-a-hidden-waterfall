Text: "In this small mountain town, it is said that magic grows straight up from the\
  \ earth. It roots deep into the ground and reaches high into the sky. The town motto,\
  \ yellow script along the welcome sign, reads: aqu\xED lo m\xE1gico es natural.\n\
  \nMeaning: here the magic is natural. Here the magic is the deep green valley, tucked\
  \ away between mountains. Here the magic is the dense forest, ribboned by the clear\
  \ blue river. Here the magic is nature. \n\nThis is El Bols\xF3n, in Argentina\u2019\
  s Patagonia region, and I reach the town by bus from Bariloche. Taking the motto\
  \ by heart, the town has assumed a fairy tale persona - small wooden cottages nestle\
  \ into the forest and mountainside, half-consumed by vegetation; the town square\
  \ hosts a bohemian market, una feria artesanal, all handcrafts and woodcarvings;\
  \ the wind speaks through homemade chimes.\n\nI walk to my hostel down a cobbled\
  \ street that slowly turns to dirt and gravel. This path borders an empty field\
  \ outlined by deep trenches. I learn later that this field, overgrown with weeds\
  \ and the lilac cones of lupin flowers, was once the small town\u2019s makeshift\
  \ airport. Lapwings soar and land on the green runway. \n\nI reach the hostel and\
  \ sleep a long night on a stiff upper bunk. The next morning I wake to rain, and\
  \ watch it collect on the ridges of a stained-glass mandala window. The glass and\
  \ water warp the world outside: violet skies and turquoise mountains; a rainbow\
  \ storm pours down. \n\nI step outside and begin walking, my boots sinking deep\
  \ into wet mud. I pull my map out, search for hiking trails, but fat drops of water\
  \ soak through and blur the outlined paths. Soon I\u2019ve lost my way looking for\
  \ la cascada escondida, the hidden waterfall. The irony and rain soak through me.\
  \ \n\nBut then: a bark. It\u2019s quick and sharp and followed by another. I turn\
  \ and see a small dog staring me down from the side of the road. It\u2019s long\
  \ coat may have been white, and it may have been smooth, but in this weather it\u2019\
  s muddy brown and knotted, more earth than fur. Again it barks, but this time it\
  \ turns and runs into a small path hidden between shrubs.\n\nI turn away but a fourth\
  \ bark stops my tracks. This time, I follow.\n\nThe path is canopied and mostly\
  \ sheltered from the rain, and the ground is no longer gravel but soft mud and rotted\
  \ leaves. My boots sink ankle deep and it\u2019s slow-going up the inclined path.\
  \ When I slow, the dog barks. A command. \n\nI follow up, slipping on wet rocks\
  \ and grabbing onto loose roots that stick out from the earth like giant worms.\
  \ My guide is tireless, a true herder, and soon I\u2019ve reached a peak where we\
  \ continue down to the other side. My feet slip and down I go, a muddy slide, reaching\
  \ the bottom of the path on my backside.\n\nThe small dog pants at my face and its\
  \ eyes, hazel and human, say: \u201CWe\u2019re not done yet.\u201D\n\nWe walk onwards\
  \ for a quarter of an hour. Now my guide is no longer ahead but keeping trot beside\
  \ me. Then I hear it: the unmistakeable roar of falling water, the echo of a hidden\
  \ waterfall. \n\nI remove my muddy boots, wade into the river, and walk toward the\
  \ wall of water. The river splits into three from its origin point high in the mountains.\
  \ I reach into the middle fall and wash my hands in the cold water. The spray is\
  \ fine and for a moment I\u2019m unable to tell the waterfall from the rain. I close\
  \ my eyes and listen to the white noise of water.\n\nI wonder: will my guide wait\
  \ for me at the bank? Did it leave to find another traveler? And could it be that\
  \ it simply sprang from the earth, a product of this town\u2019s magic, the alchemy\
  \ of nature?\n\nThen through the rain and waterfall I hear it: a bark. I know what\
  \ this means now, so I wade back through the river and follow."
