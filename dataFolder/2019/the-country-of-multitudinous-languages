Text: "I have been told that India is the closest example depicting a melting pot\
  \ of cultural and religious diversity. You will notice that no two persons from\
  \ two different geographical locations in India will ever look the same or speak\
  \ the same language even if it is a distance of 1 km or just your neighbor. And\
  \ that's exactly why I'd like to call it many nations within one nation. By now\
  \ you would have already guessed that I am keen on sharing my travel stories from\
  \ India. I had the chance to travel around India just like any other tourist when\
  \ I studied there for a few years. It was quite the contrast in terms of the country\
  \ that I was brought up in, that is Singapore, which unlike India is a small dot\
  \ on the map. \n\nBeing a student of architecture, back then I was constantly drawn\
  \ to all the breathtaking monuments that were waiting to be captured in my sketchbook.\
  \ Looks like life had other plans and instead of making sketches of some of India's\
  \ timeless and historical palaces and religious shrines, I ended up spending every\
  \ other week in a different city trying different kinds of food and talking to different\
  \ people and to my surprise even the people from the most remote areas could converse\
  \ with you in broken English which made life easier for me and also helped me learn\
  \ a few of the words and sentences in their native languages. These were all different\
  \ people from all walks of life in different cities, towns and even villages. Someone\
  \ who has traveled extensively all over India can definitely vouch for the numerous\
  \ languages spoken here.\n\nWhat came as a surprise to me was even though India\
  \ has different states and every state has a state language, not everyone within\
  \ a particular state speak the same language. This is when the most intriguing fact\
  \ of the country hit me, India has more than 780 languages and around 19,500 dialects\
  \ spoken as a mother tongue. As of now, 2019 has been rightly marked as the \"International\
  \ year of Indigenous languages\" as per a campaign by UNESCO. It has also been stated\
  \ that most of the Indian languages might die in the next 50 years. A staggering\
  \ number of languages have already been categorized as endangered. I am sure this\
  \ awareness campaign is a great deal to every Indian, at least I felt so when I\
  \ learnt about it. My roots are Indian and during any kind of travel, people would\
  \ assume I speak Hindi because of my Indian ancestry. They would further make guesses\
  \ by stating the state languages as my mother tongue and sadly no one would even\
  \ come close to guessing my mother tongue. This made me wonder if people are even\
  \ aware of the other languages spoken by many Indians. Travelling around India just\
  \ made me realize that there are so many other indigenous languages here, It opens\
  \ a whole new world of different songs in all these languages and dialects which\
  \ are so foreign and unknown to outsiders. Well, I learnt that India was not just\
  \ Bollywood, it was definitely more than that. So many languages and so little time.\
  \ \n\nLanguages should help us build bridges to understand and celebrate different\
  \ cultures and traditions and not barriers that segregate people from one another.\
  \ India is a beautiful country but if the people in this country were to live harmoniously\
  \ without marking territories with languages, it would be a paradise considering\
  \ the different kinds fun traditions they can share with one another. Initiatives\
  \ from organisations like UNESCO and the Indian government can help in preserving\
  \ the languages which are not extinct yet. \n\nThe beauty of travelling is that\
  \ it makes us less ignorant and more understanding towards all the communities in\
  \ the world and language is one of the most important aspects of it. Even the word\
  \ \"travel\" itself sounds different and evokes a different kind of emotion in different\
  \ languages. Here is hoping to a future where all the hidden languages of the world\
  \ and especially India are more accessible to everyone. Every language has a story\
  \ of its own after all."
