Text: 'Two friends decide to go on a trip to India, because they feel trapped in thoughts
  and behaviors of the  western world. The girls are confronted with a culture so
  diverse and colorful, chaotic and determined, open-hearted and still disrespectful
  on their journey.

  As they have a very different personality, they handle their impressions differently:
  Luise is outgoing and absorbing the new universe without any struggles, while Antonia
  is introspective, trying to understand how this country works and how the background
  story was written (and by whom).

  They develop a deeper friendship and helping each others very well, but after a
  few weeks they notice how important it is to experience on their own: Luise stays
  in Kerala (the south of India) and Antonia is taking a train to Rajasthan (the north,
  close to Pakistan). Luise is falling in love, staying in an ashram, living in hippie
  villages at the beach and Antonia is attending a safari in the desert, joining the
  biggest wedding in the city and is being introduced to the life of the rich Indians,
  while she''s also seeing the poverty issues of India.

  In their very different ways of perceiving and experiencing, they both feel how
  it changes them. As they meet again in Auroville, which is a city that''s not following
  the rules of the rest of the world (no money, everyone voluntarily helps, spirituality
  instead of religion), they notice the change in each other. In a lot of fights,
  jealousies and discussions, they finally notice that their personality is a different
  one now - what will happen in the last two weeks? How will life be back in the western
  culture?'
