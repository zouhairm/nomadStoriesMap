Text: "I woke up with a start, trying to place myself in the world. In the few moments\
  \ that my mind needed to recall where I was, memories of the previous evening flooded\
  \ back. Kashmir has that unique quality of turning from beautiful to bloody in the\
  \ blink of an eye. I\u2019d just made it to the Srinagar airport in time for my\
  \ flight to Delhi when the voice in the machine ominously drawled, \u201CAll flights\
  \ from Srinagar to Delhi have been cancelled. Indefinitely\u201D. I swatted away\
  \ a vision of Tom Hanks and his hapless face from 'The Terminal'. Things couldn\u2019\
  t possibly get that bad. Or could they? \n\nThere were two things I could do. Stay\
  \ \u2018indefinitely\u2019 at a crowded airport crackling with tension. Or get back\
  \ to my friend\u2019s place in the city where I knew there would be warm food and\
  \ a comfy bed and safety. Food, bed, safety, I decided. \n\nI rushed out into the\
  \ chill. It had just begun to snow and the light was failing. A row of taxis greeted\
  \ me with tightly rolled up windows. No amount of rapping on the windows made the\
  \ drivers roll them down. Then it hit me. It was probably near to 5 pm. The curfew\
  \ begins at 5. \n\nI could feel flecks of snow settling in my hair and turning to\
  \ water as I hurried back towards the airport entry point. A jawan, a \u2018junior\
  \ soldier\u2019 of the Indian army stopped me. \u201CWhere are you going, madam?\
  \ The airport shuts down at 5. This is Kashmir. You should know better.\u201D He\
  \ stared down at me, taking in my backpack and trolley. His suspicions weren\u2019\
  t unwarranted, I knew. There had been too many \u2018incidents\u2019 lately. He\
  \ began gesticulating to another group of jawans. \u201CI\u2019m going. It\u2019\
  s fine!\u201D I told him, as I saw the others approaching.\n\nBlood sang in my ears.\
  \ I could hear my heart. I barely managed to make it back to the taxi stand when\
  \ my knees gave way. I could hear a shuffling of feet. Despair had immobilized me\
  \ and I just knelt there, my head in my hands. \u201CMadam, Kashmir ke log itne\
  \ bhi bure nahi hai\" (The people of Kashmir aren\u2019t that bad). I will take\
  \ you into the city in my taxi. Just give me the address,\u201D a man said, as he\
  \ gave me his hand. Even today I can\u2019t describe the extent of gratitude I felt\
  \ for this person, this stranger called Javed, who was willing to risk his life\
  \ for mine. The kindest man in the world is what I\u2019ll always call him.\n\n\
  The knock on the door brought me back to the present. I\u2019d made it back to my\
  \ friend\u2019s place safe the previous night and I\u2019d slept surprisingly well.\
  \ My taxi had arrived, my friend informed me. I\u2019d go to Jammu from where I\u2019\
  d be able to take a bus ride to Delhi.\n\nI had traveled to Srinagar for a wedding,\
  \ a beautiful indoor ceremony. I was taking back with me the experience of their\
  \ culture and a humbling experience of humanity, the memory of the taste of \u2018\
  Kashmiri Wazwan \u2013 a multi-course meal using lamb and chicken\u2019. The sweet\
  \ laughter of family and friends, that breaks through the gloomy fate hanging from\
  \ the eaves outside. \n\nNestled in the Himalayas, Srinagar is the heart of Kashmir,\
  \ India\u2019s \u2018Paradise on Earth\u2019. Even though there is insurgency and\
  \ unrest, the people living there are tolerant, holding it together, sharing love\
  \ and affection and smiling through these winds of adversity. I got out of bed,\
  \ quickly readied myself for the journey ahead. The experience of the previous day\
  \ had added texture and meaning to my time here. Walking down the wooden staircase\
  \ to the fresh smell of \u2018Kahwa - a tea flavored with cardamom and infused with\
  \ cloves, cinnamon and saffron\u2019, I knew that I might be leaving this time,\
  \ but I had to come back."
