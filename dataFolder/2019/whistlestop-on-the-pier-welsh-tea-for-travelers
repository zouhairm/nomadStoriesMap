Text: "My three children run up ahead of me pointing enthusiastically at a sign advertising\
  \ Welsh pancakes and tea. Hunger pangs and my wind-chilled cheeks motivate me to\
  \ pick up the pace toward the Whistlestop Cafe on the old wooden Bangor Pier. Only\
  \ two days into a three-month stay in Wales, I long to wrap my chilled fingers around\
  \ a warm cup of tea. \n\nDucking out of the drizzle, we cram around one of the cafe\u2019\
  s two tables. The owner, a bald and rose-cheeked man in his sixties, greets us in\
  \ Welsh, \u201CCroeso! Bore Da!\u201D We collectively shiver and reply, \u201CBore\
  \ Da! Good morning!\u201D \n\n\u201CWelcome out the wind\u201D he says, \u201Cmake\
  \ yourselves comfortable. My wife, June here will get you what you like!\u201D We\
  \ order two Welsh pancakes, tea and bara brith\u2014 a traditional Welsh speckled\
  \ bread with tea-soaked dried fruit and mixed spices.\n\nAs our new friend Terry\
  \ prepares the pancakes, June brings out a thick, warm slice of bara brith loaded\
  \ with rich Welsh butter and a cup of warm tea. She wipes her hands on her apron\
  \ which displays the Welsh flag\u2014 a red dragon with a white and green background.\
  \ \u201CAlright sweeties, from your accents, sounds like your from the States, yeah?\u201D\
  \n\nWe nod politely, mouths full of bara brith. From behind the counter, Terry speaks\
  \ up, \u201CWell then kiddies, welcome to Wales!\u201D He points at the end of the\
  \ pier, which juts into the sea. \u201CWe\u2019re sitting on top of Menai Strait\
  \ right here. And over there\u201D \u2013 he squints into the distance \u2013 \u201C\
  is Anglesey Island. The Vikings came through here hundreds of years ago.\u201D\n\
  \n\u201CVikings?\u201D my son asks, crumbs falling out of his mouth.\n\n\u201CVikings,\u201D\
  \ Terry confirms. \u201CIn the 11th century to be exact!\u201D\n\nJune sets down\
  \ a plate of thin, fluffy pancakes doused in lemon juice and powdered sugar. She\
  \ says, \u201CTerry, love, enough about Vikings. Tell them about our Wales!\u201D\
  \n\nTerry obliges, sharing secrets of the area\u2014 first, the Roman Camp situated\
  \ just down from the pier and up a hill overlooking the Strait. He tells us about\
  \ Abergwyngregyn Falls, hidden in the foothills of the Snowdonia Mountains and surrounded\
  \ by lush forests with views of the sea. He gives us the bus number to the trail\
  \ head, explaining which path to take and where to look for wild horses.  \n\n\u201C\
  And don\u2019t miss Llanddwyn Island, a small island accessible at low-tide from\
  \ Newborough Beach on Anglesey,\u201D he whispers. \u201CIt\u2019s where St. Dwynwen\
  \ forsook true love and started a convent.\u201D \n\n\u201CAnd for some real culture,\
  \ you must visit Harlech and Criccieth castles on the coast.\u201D Terry stands\
  \ a bit taller, \u201COur ancestors built castles, not for war, but for poetry,\
  \ songs and games. Try to learn the names of our princes and princesses, they will\
  \ get you all tongue-tied!\u201D \n\nThe sun peeks through the grey clouds, casting\
  \ a glittering effect over the white caps on the Strait. I start to pay for our\
  \ meal, but Terry pushes the pounds in my hand away, \u201CNo love, this is on us.\
  \ How about for payment, you and the kiddies come back and tell us about your adventures.\
  \ I\u2019ll bet you have some tales to tell.\u201D \n\nAnd we did. Ten weeks, hundreds\
  \ of miles on the train, dozens of hikes, and countless adventures later, we gathered\
  \ back around the table at the Whistlestop Caf\xE9. Between warm bites of sweets,\
  \ we shared tales of exploring fairy glens in Betws-y-Coed, the \u2018birth place\
  \ of fairies\u2019 and tramping up the stone staircase of Dolwyddelan Castle. My\
  \ son recited the legend of Gelert-- medieval Welsh Prince Llewelyn's protective\
  \ hound who saved a baby's life. \u201CNow there is good lad!\u201D Terry exclaimed.\
  \ June nodded with satisfaction while my little one recounted our hike up to Aber\
  \ Falls where we soaked our feet in the milky streams. \u201CBut my favorite was\
  \ St. Dwynen\u2019s Island,\u201D I shared, \u201CI could feel her mourning for\
  \ her lost love on that remote shore.\u201D \n\nWinking, Terry refills my tea, and\
  \ with a soft, contented sigh says \u201CSo then, you\u2019ve fallen in love with\
  \ Wales, have you?\u201D Indeed, I had."
