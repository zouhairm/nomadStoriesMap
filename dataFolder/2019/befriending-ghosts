Text: "I\u2019d seen the old photos taken from this very spot. The panoramic, black\
  \ and white photos depicting the 38 ships all neatly lined up in the calm waters\
  \ of King George Sound. The tall, billowing clouds of smoke announcing that each\
  \ was ready and awaiting orders to set sail towards a future of uncertainty. When\
  \ I discovered that I too could look out across the bay from the very same point,\
  \ I was determined to capture my own version of the photograph over a century after\
  \ the original.\nWhere once the port of Albany in Western Australia played host\
  \ to an entire fleet of war ships, today there was only one freight ship moored\
  \ in the peaceful waters. I was grateful for it though. It brought scale to this\
  \ vast expanse of water encased by its vibrant green rolling hills and golden beaches.\
  \ This was a place full of emotions, deep rooted into within the earth. The assembly\
  \ of what would become the ANZACs may be a distant memory, but the hopes and dreams\
  \ of 30,000 soldiers and their families are still very much present. I could almost\
  \ hear the loud blasts of the ship\u2019s horns, the teary-eyed farewells to loved\
  \ ones not knowing if they would ever see each other again and the chorus\u2019\
  \ of those much beloved wartime songs being sung to mask the nerves of the unknown\
  \ to come. \nI wondered what Brigadier General Harold \u2018Pompey\u2019 Elliott\
  \ made of this great gathering. Did he have revel in this grand gathering of troops?\
  \ Or was this just be another notch on his military belt? I had met Brigadier Pompey\
  \ earlier that day during my visit to the national ANZAC centre. Within the grounds\
  \ of the Princess Royal Fortress, the national ANZAC centre is a museum focussed\
  \ around the people not just objects and facts. \nEach visitor is given a small\
  \ card about the size of a playing card with the identity of one of 50 Australians\
  \ who saw war and its effects during the 20th Century. From leaders and heroes to\
  \ rogues, the exhibit covers a variety of different perspectives allowing each visitor\
  \ a unique experience. It was here that I was introduced to Brigadier Pompey. Already\
  \ a veteran of the Boer war where he had received the Distinguished Medal of bravery,\
  \ he saw his first taste of World War one as a battalion commander on Gallipoli.\
  \ \nUsing his card and some high-tech wizardry, Brigadier Pompey\u2019s story became\
  \ intertwined with my whole ANZAC experience. From reading his letters to seeing\
  \ some of his belongings Pompey felt like a long-lost friend by the end of my journey.\
  \ Sure, there are still maps and clothing and trinkets that you would expect of\
  \ any museum but it\u2019s the stories that really bring the ANZACs history to life.\
  \ \nI heard how loud the guns were, how the smell of the dead was something that\
  \ seemed to linger even years later and of the sheer terror and devastation that\
  \ was felt by those who survived Gallipoli and from those back home whose loved\
  \ ones did not.  It was as if those battles were happening at that very minute and\
  \ these were not the voices of ghosts but of my loved ones. Before meeting Pompey,\
  \ I had known little about the ANZACs and the failed military operation of Gallipoli\
  \ during the first World War. I left with a profound understanding of the effects\
  \ of war and a sadness that I could not ask my new friend to hear more of his story.\n\
  My thoughts lingered on Pompey as I looked out across King George Sound. The gentle\
  \ sea breeze carrying whispers of moments long forgotten. There was something quite\
  \ raw about standing in the footprints of a photograph that had captured such a\
  \ historical moment in time. Many of those 30,000, young, hopeful men would never\
  \ see their homes again. I took out my camera, determined to capture an image Pompey\
  \ and the other ANZACs would be proud of. An image, over 100 years on highlighting\
  \ the beauty of homeland and freedoms that they fought to protect."
