Text: "It seemed cliched to hear the words \u201CI love you\u201D as Gianna and I\
  \ sat by the Trevi fountain at midnight. Surely this is what people travel to Rome\
  \ for.\n\nI could smell wine and basil on her breath. The nocturnal alcoves in high\
  \ walls hid sleepy starlings that didn\u2019t seem to notice the serenading street\
  \ lamps below. I didn\u2019t expect to actually find love in Rome, though it what\
  \ I wanted most.\n\nSo, this sounds like the perfect night.\n\nBut this is only\
  \ part of the story. The other part involves drunkenness, a big Australian bloke\
  \ and some slightly awkward bed-sharing.\n\n\n\n\n\nAndrew was a new friend, but\
  \ had the type of hedonistic good humour that made him a social celebrity. A love\
  \ of pizza and a disdain for physical tasks had left him soft around the middle.\
  \ His deep chuckle, his generous beard and his endearing Australian aphorisms made\
  \ him roguishly charming.\n\n\nAndrew was my wingman on my final night in Rome.\
  \ Good thing, because without this, I wouldn\u2019t have met Gianna. Although she\
  \ was American, she looked Italian. Blue eyes, olive skin and a smile as wide as\
  \ the moon. I thought she was a bit above me. So I couldn\u2019t believe it when\
  \ Andrew elbowed me in the ribs and \u201COzzie\u201D poetry escaped his lips; \u201C\
  oi mate, she\u2019s keen. This could be it\u201D. \n\nConversation and wine flowed\
  \ so freely with her. In what felt like seconds, we had escaped the music and eloped\
  \ into the quiet cobbled cul-de-sacs, as lost in each other as we were in the city.\
  \ We stumbled around fortified by wine and the sweet smells of bread and balsamic\
  \ until we reached the place that we first kissed.\n\nGianna\u2019s drunken confession\
  \ and a kiss at the Trevi fountain is where the fairytale ends. \n\nThe nasal boom\
  \ of an Australian \u201CG\u2019day\u201D made me look up. It was Andrew arm in\
  \ arm with Gianna\u2019s friend. His lopsided and impish grin seemed to leech the\
  \ mist of romance from the air. Australians are not natural romantics, and hearing\
  \ Andrew say \u201Cwe should take these chicks home\u201D was as far from \u201C\
  Roman Holiday\u201D as romance can be.\n\nTime seemed to stretch around us as we\
  \ walked, like dough being kneaded and pulled. Gianna paused now and then to kiss\
  \ me eagerly as we meandered and made our way to their apartment.\n\nWhen we arrived\
  \ Andrew and I made a beeline for the bathroom and took our turns. I splashed my\
  \ face with water, smelled my breath and tried to fix my hair. I was so nervous\
  \ that I must\u2019ve considered doing a guided meditation. I took a breath. I stepped\
  \ into the corridor.\n\nWhen I emerged, Andrew looked at me with a smirk.\n\n\u201C\
  They sleep in the same room\u201D, he said. \u201CCheck it out\u201D.\n\nNot only\
  \ did they sleep in the same room, but the girls were fast asleep, each on their\
  \ tiny single beds one metre from each other. I realised that only Andrew would\
  \ get to see my freshly flattened hairdo that night.\n\nWe looked at each other.\
  \ Andrew shrugged. I shrugged. We looked at the clock and, perched awkwardly on\
  \ the edge of their beds, passed out just as quickly as they had.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\
  I was alone in the bed when I woke up. Andrew coughed to get my attention. \n\u201C\
  Where\u2019s old mate\u201D? He said.\n\nI had no idea where \u201Cold mate\u201D\
  \ was.\n\nThe starlings were rousing and the subway smelled of espresso when we\
  \ boarded the morning train. We sat in silence for a while, content with enjoying\
  \ the cadence of the Italian language and not quite sure what to say. As we neared\
  \ our station Andrew looked up and said what I had been thinking.\n\n\u201CWell.\
  \ That was weird\u201D. \n\nI didn\u2019t really expect to find love in Rome but\
  \ I had been surprised. I never spoke to Gianna again. I didn\u2019t need to. I\
  \ had found love, albeit transient, and Rome had kept its promise; the street lamps\
  \ and the starlings, the passions and the aromas. I know I will return to Rome.\
  \ And when I do, I will visit the Trevi fountain again at midnight, just in case."
