Text: "Earth from above is completely different, that is obvious. But, doesn\u2019\
  t matter how much you studied and how much you travel, there will be always something\
  \ to be amazing by. At night, all I could see from the airplane seat was how smaller\
  \ cities are as we move away from S\xE3o Paulo. All the sudden, the cities are also\
  \ less. Until I can see only two or three groups of lights. We had left Brazil.\
  \ The map on the airplane screens confirms my thought.\nUruguay wasn't a planned\
  \ trip. We got a good price, we booked, we went. No high expectations, but we could\
  \ never imagine what awaited us in our few days in that country. I was expecting\
  \ an easy Spanish, beach, sun and hot weather. But I was given history and culture.\n\
  We had luck with our guide, Tito, who is a historian and love to talks. He told\
  \ us that Uruguay was the only Spanish country that did not declare independence\
  \ from Spain but from Brazil. A surprise for us Brazilians, because our history\
  \ teachers never told us that part of our past. \nI heard some good tales during\
  \ my days there, and get fascinated about the name Uruguay, a native world that\
  \ means Colorful Birds, and the origin from the flag, blue and white with a big\
  \ sun. Uruguayos call themselves Orientales because they\u2019re the eastern people.\
  \ The sun is their symbol, representing enlightenment, knowledge, elucidation, and\
  \ also the sun itself.\nI wasn\u2019t expecting to learn so much both about my own\
  \ country and about the place I was visiting. Colonia Del Sacramento, a small old\
  \ city, is located up in the river, Rio de la Plata. The river is so large that\
  \ someone unknowing can take it as the Atlantic Ocean. The old part of Colonia preserves\
  \ the architecture, the stone streets, from the eras ago. Tito showed the difference\
  \ between the Portuguese and Spanish occupation, explaining how the city changed\
  \ as both people put their flag in the city.  Colonia del Sacramento has the perfect\
  \ location, at the almost ending of the Plata river. This river has one of it\u2019\
  s beginning in Brazil. During the era of gold, all gold from Minas Gerais should\
  \ be marked with the Crown sign. Smugglers would take the melted gold through the\
  \ Tiete river, that goes to the countryside, from S\xE3o Paulo state, crossing Paran\xE1\
  , disembogue on the Plata, arriving at Colonia, where would be \u201Cmake legal\u201D\
  \ and transport to other places. Thousand of Brazilian gold was smuggling through\
  \ there.\nBesides the historical part, Uruguay also surprised me with the weather,\
  \ the architecture, and nature.\nAs I said, I was expecting hot weather and the\
  \ beach. The beach was, in Montevideo, actually a river, the Plata. I\u2019ve never\
  \ seen anything like the Plata. That river is beyond anything other people can tell.\
  \ Numbers and facts don\u2019t prepare you to see a river so large that on the other\
  \ side is another country (Argentina), and you definitely can\u2019t see it. The\
  \ water is similar to the ocean. It has waves and changes color as the sun moves\
  \ in the sky. If you seat in a Rambla and contemplate, your mind will travel back\
  \ in time, trying to wonder how was that formed. \nAt Punta del Leste there are\
  \ two kinds of a beach: the calm, that is bathed by the Plata river, and the Playa\
  \ Brava, bathed by the Atlantic. In Punta anyone can visit the Casapueblo, a hotel,\
  \ so, you can stay there if you desire. Casapueblo was built by the plastic artist\
  \ uruguayo Carlos P\xE1ez Vilar\xF3, and, besides the hotel, it is also a museum\
  \ with his works and a movie room with a short film about his son, one of the survives\
  \ from the air crash that happened in 1972 at the Andes, in Chile.\nAs I returned\
  \ home I saw Uruguay fade from the airplane window. The world changed again, the\
  \ cities growing bigger, and then, S\xE3o Paulo. An unplanned trip revealed a part\
  \ of my country history. Maybe a book would not be enough to explain how Uruguay\
  \ can change the way you see the Earth."
