Text: "Dream Meaning Of Travelling.\nDreams about traveling are common. At the heart\
  \ of this dream lies one secret which I will share with you. In my research, this\
  \ dream can often occur when you are undertaking a spiritual awakening, even a transformation.\n\
  I bet you cannot wait. You're excited to be jetting off. But wait, this amazing\
  \ feeling is in your dream. Oh no. I had to throw this in here. But, it is tempting\
  \ to think that this dream is about a journey you may take in real life. Everything\
  \ in your dream is symbolic of an aspect of yourself. The first goal: is to understand\
  \ and learn what this \u201Cnight travels\u201D mean. How to open up the meaning\
  \ so this can be used as a gateway to your own personal empowerment in life. I am\
  \ Flo and I will help you make sense of your travel dream. To make this as easy\
  \ as possible I have broken down each dream into questions. Just scroll down my\
  \ dream meaning to find your answer.\nDreams of traveling can involve many \u201C\
  dream\u201D props and often leave you in the morning wondering what it means. Maybe\
  \ you could see yourself zigzagging through China or finding yourself on a safari\
  \ among elephants, leopards. Traveling spiritually is all about an inner journey\
  \ you are about to embark on. At a glance, this dream is a good clue to certain\
  \ aspects of your life right now. Maybe you could see yourself traveling in a car,\
  \ bus, train or getting on a plane with rotating propellers. I can reveal the following:\
  \ everything in your travel dream is associated with an aspect of your life experiences.\
  \ When you change your journey in the dream this is connected to enhancing your\
  \ own understanding of life. My work over the last few decades has led me to determine\
  \ that our mind and body are connected and awakened. Many people have contacted\
  \ me about dreaming of packing bags, losing passports, taking a train journey, are\
  \ you getting ready for a journey or carrying too many material possessions. I will\
  \ deal with all of these in turn. But the \u201Ctravel\u201D symbol in your dream\
  \ suggests that you are connected to the direct levels of higher consciousness.\
  \ Maybe you have been recently considering who you are as a human being and rediscovering\
  \ hidden talents. To carry too much luggage on your person in a dream can indicate\
  \ that you need to let any emotional baggage go.\nWhat\u2019s the general meaning\
  \ of traveling dreams? From a spiritual perspective, the dreams of travel can indicate\
  \ your own physiological status in waking life. It can suggest that you are focused\
  \ on moving forward as I have mentioned earlier. A journey is a symbol of transformation,\
  \ a start, a symbol of risks and of course opportunities. There could be many things\
  \ that crop up in your dream. To travel to a particular destination in your dream\
  \ represents the path you\u2019re currently walking in life and the actions you\
  \ may take to determine your life goals. However, to travel and \u201Cget lost\u201D\
  \ in your dream also signifies your wish to escape reality and everyday routine.\
  \ To travel by car in your dream symbolizes your movement in life. In other words,\
  \ it represents your life journey. If you\u2019re carrying too much luggage, it\
  \ means you\u2019re holding on to your dead past that\u2019s dragging you down.\
  \ However, if you didn\u2019t have any luggage in your dream while traveling and\
  \ you felt free and easy, it denotes major changes in your perception of life and\
  \ yourself in general. Buying tickets to a destination in a dream suggests you will\
  \ experience something that will ease up and open your mind and soul."
