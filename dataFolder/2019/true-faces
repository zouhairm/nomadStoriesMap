Text: "Mid-way through January I got a visit from my aunt from Spain, completely unaware\
  \ yet of what it would mean. \nLet me briefly introduce myself, I am somewhat of\
  \ a repressed traveler from Buenos Aires. I love traveling, I have done it on my\
  \ own, with family, friends and my couple, but I had never made a big trip, that\
  \ far away from home. \nBack to the visits from Spain, one family lunch while talking\
  \ about the trip my girlfriend was going to make to Europe someone asked \u201C\
  why don\xB4t you go?\u201D I caught my aunt staring at me. A repressed traveller\
  \ is similar to the person that needs to be pushed when bungee jumping, and now\
  \ I was at the edge of a bridge, looking down at Europe. It was a few days of standing\
  \ on the ledge, until my very determined girlfriend gave me that last push I needed.\
  \  I was flying.\nAfter two months of last minute planning I was at an airport in\
  \ Paris, for the first time ever at a place where I don\u2019t speak the local language.\
  \ A third of my journey had already flown by and still the feelings of surrealism\
  \ wouldn\xB4t go. My first glimpse at the Eiffel tower was through the front of\
  \ the rectangular glass of a bus, and the cinematic view it was sliding through\
  \ made me wonder, that maybe I was at the front seat of an incredibly immersive\
  \ movie.\nI would meet with my girlfriend 36 hours later so the arrangement was\
  \ that I would visit the places that she didn\xB4t want to see. History, horror\
  \ movies and the afterlife are subjects we do not share and there is only one place\
  \ in Paris that merges all of them, Pere-Lachaise cemetery. \nIt was a cold cloudy\
  \ day, it had rained at the break of dawn, and the mossy cobble stone of the cemetery\u2019\
  s streets forced me to walk slowly. As a photographer I learnt that early times\
  \ of the day are perfect to get clean shots at highly touristic locations. For a\
  \ while I felt at a niche of the Parisian tourist trail, attracted of my own weirdness\
  \ that had me changing the film of my analogic camera at an old cemetery in the\
  \ \u201CCity of Love\u201D. It took a family of happy tourists with a map, looking\
  \ for famous people\xB4s tomb and a beam of sunlight through the clouds to crush\
  \ the offsetting ambient.  I was suddenly a mere admirer of the flamboyant crypt\
  \ architecture.\nAs my interest had faded I started looking for the way out, to\
  \ continue my search for a Parisian niche. But Pere-Lachaise had something else\
  \ planned for me. On my way out I heard a sweeping noise, there was no wind so it\
  \ couldn\u2019t be the trees, and all the leaves were lying still on the ground.\
  \ A few graves to my right I saw what was causing the rare sound, and a small feeling\
  \ of shame slipped to my chest. An old woman in an apron, with a hand brush and\
  \ a bucket of water was thoroughly cleaning a grave. Moving a flower vase with a\
  \ lot of effort to cover every detail and careful not to disturb other graves. Amidst\
  \ the moss jungle the marble stone commemorative inscription stood proud against\
  \ time. I stared at her for a few seconds, coming to realization of where I was,\
  \ of how the beauty in the carving of stones made me forget what they represented.\
  \ My camera was hanging from my hand and I took the shot, maybe the only real true\
  \ picture I have ever taken. \nIt made this repressed traveller understand the true\
  \ nature of places, taking a deep view in the many anonymous faces that go by unaware\
  \ as a tourist. It gave life to centuries-old cathedrals, and it filled the narrow\
  \ medieval streets with hundreds of people timelessly walking still.  My favorite\
  \ photographer once said \u201CIf your photographs are not good enough you're not\
  \ close enough\u201D, and I am trying to get closer. Unexpected trips lead to unexpected\
  \ moments thanks to unexpected jumps. And Spanish aunts\u2026"
