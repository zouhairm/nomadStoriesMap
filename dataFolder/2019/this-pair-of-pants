Text: "In this pair of pants, I have become a Builder.\n\nOn the last day of September,\
  \ grinning and slipping in mud under an overcast sky, I arrived with no return ticket\
  \ on the newly-purchased land of my close friend. It was a windswept patch of dirt\
  \ and waving grass amidst rural sprawl on the northern coast of Nova Scotia, ripe\
  \ with possibility.\n\nI pulled out my new, crisp, ready-for-anything nylon pants.\
  \ For the next twelve weeks, I wore them almost every single day.\n\nNow, I watch\
  \ the sunrise through the porch door of a new house, and the inevitable has come.\
  \ It\u2019s time to pack up and discover another patch of dirt on my journey. But\
  \ as I fold these pants on their final day, I see what I had never expected when\
  \ I suited up on that September morn. I see everything that they saw. \n\nThese\
  \ pants have known the patter of sawdust off the chop saw and the splatter of ceramic\
  \ in water from cutting tile. They have patches of dried mortar from laying said\
  \ tile. They are smeared with red and grey paint. There is a hole from bumping into\
  \ the propane heater and melting the fabric, before the house had electric heat.\
  \ There are bits of crusty spray foam from filling wall cuts and sealing windows.\
  \ There are marks of sap from the lumber cut at the sawmill down the road. There\
  \ are muddy paw prints from the jumpy pup and the adoring cat. \n\nThe left pocket\
  \ has a fraying seam from repeated clippings of my measuring tape. Both pockets\
  \ have held wire nuts, ear plugs, knives, Robertsons and Phillips and flat-heads,\
  \ wire strippers and cutters. They\u2019ve held staples, pliers, chain links, pencils,\
  \ Sharpies, cough drops, handkerchiefs, lip balm, peanuts for the dog and even a\
  \ drill carried up a ladder. They have held countless screws, nails, bolts and washers\
  \ of all types, including those continually scavenged from the job site. The pockets\
  \ have cradled my hands in every stroll up the hill and in each moment of conversation\
  \ or quiet contemplation.\n\nThe bottoms have seen the change of seasons brought\
  \ with the phases of the moon. They have been soaked by the muddy water of an electrical\
  \ trench and brushed with wet grasses covered in morning dew. They've been darkened\
  \ by raindrops and scented with smoke by an autumn fire. They've been splashed with\
  \ grey slush patterned by the tires of pickup trucks. They've been buried in snow\
  \ drifts and blasted with sleet carried by the gusting maritime winds. \n\nThese\
  \ pants have been tested by the earth, cement, wood and flooring that I knelt upon.\
  \ They have been stretched by the thousands of times that I have squatted and reached\
  \ and hoisted and occasionally danced. They have inevitably served the role of a\
  \ napkin while I sat at the worn wooden table where meals almost always involved\
  \ pickles.\n\nAll at once, this sturdy, trusty, filthy pair of pants tells a most\
  \ wonderful story. It is one of growth and pain, knowledge and thought. It is a\
  \ tale of no-name days that each start with honeyed porridge and end with tired\
  \ bones, evidence of a joyful day's toil. It is a narrative filled by a chorus of\
  \ community voices, the melodies of each our personal journeys, and the harmony\
  \ of the forest bundled up to the sea.\n\nIndeed, as I lovingly tuck these pants\
  \ into my suitcase, I see what a worthy companion they have been throughout this\
  \ beautiful and unexpected experience. But, in truth, they are material. \n\nIt\
  \ is I who stained their threads. It is I who filled their pockets. It is I who\
  \ walked the paths and labored through the seasons. \nIt is I who carries the story\
  \ behind quiet brown eyes.\n\nIt is I, forever changed; I, the Builder."
