Text: "Finally I reached at the doors of this barren Forbidden City which is lying\
  \ crushed in the lap of the beautiful Neelum valley. It has been 20 years since\
  \ I left this place with my grandfather, after the mysterious disappearance of the\
  \ Kashmir residents in one night. I reached for the grey broken door and removed\
  \ the dust from the nameplate named- Shard Town. This place doesn\u2019t exist on\
  \ the map anymore and so I had to ask the local people about the Saral Lake on whose\
  \ foothills my former home was. \nI walked on the black sand noticing that there\
  \ was no wind, no noise, just an obnoxious silence which is getting creepier with\
  \ every step my trembling legs are making. All the stories my grandfather told me\
  \ about this lush green place are coming back to me now, only the place isn\u2019\
  t a bit like what it was in the stories.\nI reached in my bag and took the newspaper\
  \ out, which I had kept with me all these years. \u2018The Mysterious disappearance\
  \ of Kashmiri people before the Pakistani missiles hit Shard Town.\u2019\nI and\
  \ my grandfather are the only members of this clan who exist, reason being, he had\
  \ took me along to gather the firewood for the upcoming winter and we had spent\
  \ the night in the forest instead of coming home. That was one night which changed\
  \ everything- my home, my nationality and my language too.\nI turned next from where\
  \ the sweets shop used to be onto the street where my house was. By now the sky\
  \ has become black with clouds, and the place seemed even scarier. The silence was\
  \ driving me mad. I looked at my watch and it wasn\u2019t working. It has just suddenly\
  \ stopped. \nI backed off and quickened my steps out of the street. Strangely the\
  \ wind started blowing; its sharp sound was piercing my ears as if it was carrying\
  \ the voices of the disappeared clan. With heart pounding fast, I ran faster to\
  \ reach the door. \nBut there was something very strange, the more I ran, the more\
  \ the streets were coming. Frantically I searched for the sweets shop. All these\
  \ streets and barren houses looked the same to me now, as though they were repeating\
  \ like a pattern. \nThe next turn I made, I found myself standing in front of my\
  \ house. I could say it was my house because it was the only house that was made\
  \ of wood. I stared at it, rewinding the little memories I had of my family.\n\u2018\
  Erina\u2026\u2019 someone called my name. I shivered as I listened to the voice\
  \ I had last heard 20 years ago. It was my mother\u2019s. \nI slowly moved over\
  \ the wooden debris, towards the small opening which was the only way inside. I\
  \ bent on my knees and struggled to see through the ashes and the dust. \nSuddenly\
  \ I felt a tremendous push from behind. I felt as if I was falling into something.\
  \ \n\u2018Erina\u2026\u2019 I heard the voice again, now coming from behind. I was\
  \ afraid to open my eyes, for I doubted I was even alive.\nOpening my eyes slightly,\
  \ I saw the pink sky. And there in the center were three green suns. I quickly stood\
  \ up and shook my head, for I had no idea where I landed. I was standing in the\
  \ middle of a pathway of a forest, a forest of purple-leaf trees. \nI looked behind,\
  \ remembering the voice I heard again. My heart skipped a beat when I saw her standing\
  \ along with two purple skinned women. I knew they were from an unknown world. \n\
  \u2018Mom?\u2019 I hissed. She smiled as she did when I was young (just as I remembered).\
  \ I held her close, while the two women watched us curiously. As the streams of\
  \ tears stopped, I spoke in a choked voice, \u2018What\u2019s happening?\u2019\n\
  In response to my question, she pointed out towards a town laden with blue lotus\
  \ which was hiding itself behind the giant trees.\n\u2018This is where they brought\
  \ us, so that we could live and not be killed by our own race,\u2019 she said, looking\
  \ towards the two beautiful women."
