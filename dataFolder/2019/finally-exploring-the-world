Text: I'm A lady who originally from Dallas Texas and in all my 42 years; I've only
  been to Calhoun Arkansas as A young child. Majority of the places I ever visited
  were in Flint Michigan, New Orleans, Austin Houston. At the time when I visited
  these places is where I majority had family living their & I had never really just
  traveled. I didn't really go out of town til I was 40 year's old and I went to Las
  Vegas and it was A great trip. Through my life I've always wanted to travel all
  around the world and see and learn of all types of walks of life other than Texas...
  About two years ago I met A really awesome human being, who happens to be from Costa
  Rica and the more we got to know each other; the more I was interested in his home
  away from home. He has the greatest pictures and videos of his beautiful country
  Costa Rica, & this individual actually travels all the time, I mean Thailand ,California,
  Miami and just to name a few awesome places I've always wanted to check out the
  scenery. There so much beauty and such great nature in Costa Rica. I hope if I could
  have the opportunity to travel all around the world and get paid for it or all paid
  for, that would be such A humble and blessed experience to be able to have.
