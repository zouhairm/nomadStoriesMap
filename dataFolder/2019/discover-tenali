Text: "It was rather an unpleasant way I traveled to this marvellous village Tenali.\
  \ My train ticket reservation was canceled and I stood all night at the compartment\
  \ but I was waiting patiently for the moment to arrive when I will be able to tread\
  \ on this new land of wonders. I reached Tenali after a tiring journey of 48 hours\
  \ fr kolkata. I felt a different atmosphere there which was very appealing to me.\
  \ Though fresh air is always appealing after a long journey in a railway coach.Although\
  \ I am not claustrophobic but who likes to be in a box. Every aspiring traveller\
  \ faces hurdles during their journey but mine was the usual one \u2018Language\u2019\
  . I didn\u2019t know Telegu and talking with the locals seemed hectic to me. Then\
  \ I came up with a kickass plan of using translation software but it didn\u2019\
  t work out well as it was not able to comprehend the local accent. So tired of this\
  \ I was out of hope that I will not get any transport means to reach to the hotel\
  \ until I explain them the route although I was not at all aware of the route. I\
  \ went to the other side of the platform and saw some autorishcaw there. Through\
  \ various  gestures and some Hindi words which I guessed might be the same inTelegu\
  \ or close to those appropriate words which I need them to understand for me. And\
  \ I succeeded in explaining them the location though they fooled me by doubling\
  \ the fare which I understood later."
