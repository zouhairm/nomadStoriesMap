Text: "Hitch hiking in Britain is a dead art. Much like in the United States it is\
  \ now merely frowned upon as a dangerous and unreliable means of transport. I was\
  \ out to prove this wrong. The goal was to get to Wales by nightfall. The problem\
  \ was that I had never hitched in my life, and had no idea if getting around London,\
  \ across southern England and into the south of Wales before nightfall was remotely\
  \ achievable. \n\nMy friend Jaz and I had just arrived to London Gatwick after a\
  \ week-long stay in Copenhagen with our Danish friends. It was 10:30pm on a Sunday\
  \ night. After I got held up in non-EU passport customs, we rushed down into the\
  \ train station where she would take the 11 o\u2019clock into the city. \n\n\u201C\
  Are you sure you\u2019re gonna be okay? It\u2019s not too late to take a train into\
  \ Wales.\u201D \n\nShe leafed through the ticket kiosk. It would cost over sixty\
  \ pounds. I could only shrug. \u201CNah, I\u2019ve got tuition to pay for. It\u2019\
  s now or never.\u201D We made our hasty goodbyes and I watched her long dreadlocks\
  \ disappear into the crowd. \n\nI\u2019ve never seen the Tom Hanks movie \u2018\
  The Terminal\u2019 but can probably imagine the feeling: wandering, waiting, and\
  \ watching as the big world moves around you. An airport terminal never shuts down;\
  \ which doesn\u2019t help when you need a siesta. \n\nScouting through the place,\
  \ I discovered that all the best spots were taken. The comfortable foam covered\
  \ benches were adorned with a pack of hairy Australians and I was left with a hard\
  \ wooden bench in the middle of the airport. Stretching out, it wasn\u2019t that\
  \ bad. I mean there were the American girls gossiping next to me, \u201CShe\u2019\
  s forty but dresses like she\u2019s fourteen!\u201D, and the heavy drilling in the\
  \ middle of the terminal at exactly 3:30AM didn\u2019t help things either.\n\nWhen\
  \ 6am rolled around I was more or less ready to go. I groggily asked an information\
  \ desk woman where the best place to hitchhike was. She gave me a frown. \u201C\
  I wouldn\u2019t hitchhike, that\u2019s just dangerous.\u201D That made me feel better.\
  \ \n\nLike a lost dog I wandered out of the airport. Gatwick was clearly not designed\
  \ for departures via foot. I made my way out clinging to the side of the exit ramp;\
  \ awkwardly stretching my arm, thumb vertical. When hitchhiking, always make a sign\
  \ with your destination written on it. People will know where you want to go, and\
  \ even if they aren't heading that way they might help you get closer. Plus, it\
  \ makes you appear more legit than using an impromptu thumb. I was lucky that my\
  \ lovely Danish friend Andrea made me a pink paper sign reading \u201CWales!\u201D\
  \ and a little smiley face.\n\nDrops started falling out of the sky. I\u2019m not\
  \ gonna lie- I didn\u2019t bring a coat and wanted to cry. Bringing a waterproof\
  \ jacket would have made sense arriving to stereotypical British weather in mid\
  \ spring. Actually, I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever been greeted with a sunny\
  \ England. \n\nBut back to the situation at hand. I just walked, walked and walked.\
  \ The weather engine felt like it was starting to rev as the rain got stronger.\
  \ I read somewhere that you should make eye contact with drivers when hitchhiking,\
  \ so I started to grin at oncoming traffic; trying to catch people's eyes between\
  \ the drizzle and dark windshields. There was a disheartening feeling as I looked\
  \ into the faces of passing people. Work van drivers would give a glance and frown,\
  \ elderly couples peeked in my direction with a nervous laugh, and middle aged women\
  \ just stared right through me. I began to wonder if I had a remote chance of reaching\
  \ Wales today... should I have taken a bus? I needed an umbrella.\n\nAll of a sudden,\
  \ my inner monologue was broken by a big white van screeching up out of nowhere.\
  \ Somebody actually stopped? Running up to the door, I was greeted by a wide eyed\
  \ smile. \n\n\"Where ya going, mate?\u201D\n\n...\n\nFull travelogue is 1800 words\
  \ - editing down to 700 doesn't do the story justice. Sending the first half to\
  \ convey my writing style.\n\nThank you for reading!"
