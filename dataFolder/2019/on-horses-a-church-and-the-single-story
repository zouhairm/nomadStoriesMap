Text: "\"Did you know my father is on the play?\" the host family's youngest child\
  \ asks me as I step inside their home. It's a two-bedroom, coarse-cement floor little\
  \ construction facing a shared lawn. I'm given her bedroom while her whole family,\
  \ parents and four girls, pile up in the other. The shared bathroom is outside,\
  \ near the garden where I see oranges, persimmon fruits, cabbage, gilos, and more.\
  \ The smell of wet earth mixes with the chill air of the mountains and, at night,\
  \ I find out there are way more stars in the sky than what I'm used to see. It even\
  \ looks fake, a Photoshop manipulation by a careless designer. Yet, this is real.\n\
  \nWe arrived four hours later due our van getting stuck in the mud twice. In Southeastern\
  \ Brazil, when it rains, it pours. The only road to the district of Capivari, in\
  \ the Jequitinhonha Valley (North of the state of Minas Gerais), is always empty\
  \ of locals when this happens. But there we were and, knowing we were coming, the\
  \ locals came to our rescue. The first clue to the Mineiro hospitality that tends\
  \ to impress even other Brazilians.\n\nWe are as consultants visiting to help them\
  \ create new livelihood options through tourism. Hiking trails, carrying capacity,\
  \ sustainability... all that specialist's stuff. However, we are welcomed as friends.\
  \ \n\nFrom the entrance at the top of the mountain to the creek that limits the\
  \ village, each window gives us a hand wave from an adult, a giggle from a child\
  \ and an invitation for coffee from an elder. We were advised to accept it at least\
  \ once to avoid offenses. \"Won't you drink at a poor person's house?\" I enter\
  \ a stranger's house for a coffee but there's cake as well. Coffee here means a\
  \ whole meal with a nice conversation. \n\nInside and ready to sleep, I feel like\
  \ my bed will collapse under my weight, even though I'm short and skinny. Just another\
  \ sign of how these people's life is financially... limited. I try not to worry.\n\
  \nSleep doesn't come though. Sometime in the middle of the night, a horse starts\
  \ screaming (if I'm allowed to say that horses scream) and doesn't stop until early\
  \ in the morning. We go outside and find out a mare gave birth and the foal is the\
  \ cutest long-legged ungainly thing. An urban girl like me just wanted to watch\
  \ is as it learned its first steps into life, but my host father grabbed it by the\
  \ hips to help it stand, encouraged by the cheers of the children (his own and the\
  \ neighbors'): a human intervention my arrogance would disapprove but hey, they've\
  \ lived here their whole life! It has worked just fine so far. I kept my academic\
  \ mouth shut and cheered as well.\n\nAfter boring meetings and paper work, we are\
  \ invited to the play. I'll finally see what my youngest host was talking about\
  \ yesterday. There's no stage. The whole district gathers at the church and the\
  \ local actors climb the altar. I expect another round of local music, legends and\
  \ story telling, oral traditions and such, just like in other communities I have\
  \ visited before. My arrogance showing again...\n\nThe play is about the daily life\
  \ of Mineiros and, to my surprise, it's hilarious. Even though I live 248 km (or\
  \ 154 miles) away from Capivari, we are all in the same state. They were talking\
  \ about themselves and, for a foreigner, it might be a way to get to know more about\
  \ the traditions and way of life of Minas Gerais. For me, it was a mirror.\n\nThere's\
  \ more. Actors are not formally trained, wear no costumes. This is not a job. It's\
  \ leisure, social gathering, it's life. It's so much more than a play.\n\nAt the\
  \ end, Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie's words about the danger of a single story float\
  \ in my mind. I fell into the trap again. \nCapivari does need to create new means\
  \ for livelihood. There are no jobs available, small commerce, few ways to make\
  \ money. Life here is financially limited. But only that. Everything else is shameless\
  \ wealthy.\n\nAnd my academic arrogance? Ashamed."
