Text: "I walk down the street, dust scratching between my toes; the rickshaw that\
  \ dropped me off speeds by, almost too close; it\u2019s cool breeze slides across\
  \ my back. Up ahead a gate stands, a small gap open, just enough to peek, not enough\
  \ to truly see \u2014 a fragment, concrete planes, overflowing plants \u2014 a lesser-known\
  \ remnant of Le Corbusier\u2019s time in India. A glance at my watch, ten minutes\
  \ \u2018til nine, not quite time, so I stroll a couple blocks down the street, savor\
  \ the wafting smells of the chai stalls, step out of the way for a group of cows\
  \ on a slow plod. A cart piled high with bananas rumbles by on my right,  the harsh\
  \ call of a peacock echoes from my left, I take a sip of water. \n\nI circle back,\
  \ my path hugging the cool stone wall and the dappled shade. Take another peek,\
  \ do I knock? Should I have set up an appointment? I see a flash of purple pants\
  \ and step back, hear an offer to join in on a private tour, perfect timing after\
  \ all.\n\nWind up stairs, around columns, past the bright orange wall and through\
  \ another empty room to the roof. We trace a fresh path down and back to the gate.\
  \  A white van sits to the side. \u201CI\u2019m just here for the day,\u201D he\
  \ says. \u201CWould you like to join in on my private tour?\u201D he asks, \u201C\
  I\u2019d rather not do it alone.\u201D \n\nA white panel slides open to an air-conditioned\
  \ interior. \u201CWhy not,\u201D I think.  It\u2019s not \u2018til I climb in that\
  \ I think to ask about our next stop.\n\n---\n\nWarm sunlight on my toes, I dip\
  \ my knife into the jelly and slowly spread it, half onto the bread, part onto my\
  \ fingers, a dollop lost to the plate as I study the bus routes on the table. Bus\
  \ thirty-two to bus eight, walk fifteen minutes to bus \u2014 oh no, that\u2019\
  s wrong. A creak and a scrape, a body settles in just past the croissants. A small\
  \ chat as my eyes keep straying to the paper by my side. \u201CWhere are you heading?\u201D\
  \ he asks. \u201CMaybe I can help,\u201D he says. A couple bites of toast later\
  \ we stand by an old red car. A suitcase sits in the passenger\u2019s seat, a surfboard\
  \ peeks through the trunk, a bag of oranges seems to be trying to make an escape\
  \ through the back window.\n\nWe are half-way to the coast, my knees to my chest,\
  \ feet on the suitcase that was once strapped in with my seatbelt, windows down\
  \ to catch a small breeze, with a quick glance I check the map. We\u2019re going\
  \ where I think we are.\n\nIn a day of cool shadows, striped houses, and sandy grit\
  \ in my socks and shoes, I\u2019m glad to be one of the things nearly spilling out\
  \ of that red car.\n\n\n\n---\n\n\nWalk into the room at two in the afternoon and\
  \ there\u2019s someone asleep in one of the bunks; come back six hours later after\
  \ the tour and I don\u2019t think the body has moved an inch until he rolls over\
  \ and introduces himself; twenty-six hours and we\u2019re squished four in the backseat\
  \ and two in the front: a former NAFTA worker, a current architecture student, an\
  \ out-of-work financial advisor, and the trio who went to get the beer.\n\nDrive\
  \ deep into the night past one other set of headlights and then off the road, past\
  \ the rica-rica plants I had in my ice cream, and we stop, step out, shut-off the\
  \ car, sit in the dust. A beer tab opens, crack hiss, small slurp, the only sound.\
  \ The light of the full moon bounces off the car, walk further away. The nearest\
  \ town is which direction, the glow over there? No, that\u2019s the last light of\
  \ the sun \u2014 it slides away, deepest blue to an impenetrable black. My heart\
  \ beat in my ears is the rhythm of the desert. The stars move slowly and a chill\
  \ seeps into the blankets we brought along, but none of us move. I almost hope a\
  \ guanaco ambles our way, one more stranger for this strange night."
