Text: "I sat there on the huge steps as I watched a woman take off her sandals and\
  \ place them carefully next to her sling bag, She pulled up her ankle-length skirt\
  \ as she dipped her feet into the water, warm under the scorching afternoon sun.\
  \ I could feel myself smiling as I watched her face light up.\n\nOn my left, pedestrians\
  \ were hurrying off of Wynyard Crossing. Just a short distance away, a small yacht\
  \ was waiting for the bridge to lift so that it could enter the harbour.\n\n\u201C\
  Hello.\u201D\n\nI turned my head. I hadn\u2019t noticed that a man had taken a seat\
  \ next to me. He looked to be about fifty-ish. Dressed in a white polo-T and pressed\
  \ chino shorts, and a small cup of gelato in his hands, he had about him an aura\
  \ that was both relaxed and casual, yet proper and upright.\n\n\u201CHello,\u201D\
  \ he repeated. I smiled in return.\n\nWe chatted a little. He told me he lived less\
  \ than a half hour away from the city centre, and this was one of his favourite\
  \ spots to come to when he wanted to feel the buzz of the city. \n\n\u201CWhere\
  \ else in this world,\u201D he claimed at one point, \u201Ccan you live just twenty\
  \ minutes away from the city, and still have bush and nature right at your doorstep?\u201D\
  \n\n\u201CBut it is getting rather expensive to travel to New Zealand,\u201D he\
  \ continued to tell me. We both silently acknowledged this fact as we watched a\
  \ young man throw a ball into the harbour for his dog to fetch.\n\n\u201CWhat made\
  \ you choose to come to Auckland?\u201D he asked me.\n\n\u201CI think,\u201D I said\
  \ to him after a short pause, \u201Cit\u2019s because this place is far away from\
  \ Malaysia.\u201D \n\nAnd it was as I said that, that I realised the truth in my\
  \ statement. I had just very recently resigned from a very stressful job. I had\
  \ been feeling underwhelmed and lethargic, as if all my energy had been sapped away.\
  \ I needed to go away, but I hadn\u2019t been able to find it in myself to dive\
  \ head-first into a new adventure.\n\nI hadn\u2019t given it much thought before\
  \ this, but it suddenly became obvious to me why I had chosen to come to the City\
  \ of Sails. I had spent three years of my life as a university student here, so\
  \ there was an air of familiarity that pulled at me. I felt safe here.\n\nYet this\
  \ city was also new and unexplored. Wynyard Quarter was just a block of old, under-utilised\
  \ buildings back then. Today, it is buzzing with tourists and locals, on foot and\
  \ on wheels alike. The waterfront is lined with restaurants and bars offering extended\
  \ happy hour rates, while small pop-up caf\xE9s advertise their great coffee on\
  \ blackboard signs. \n\n\u201CWell,\u201D my companion smiled as he had his final\
  \ spoonful of gelato, \u201Cwe are far away from a lot of places in this world.\u201D\
  \n\nHe then stretched his legs in front of him before he stood up. \n\n\u201CThank\
  \ you,\u201D he said politely. \u201CThank you for taking the time to talk to me.\
  \ It\u2019s one of the things I really enjoy now that I\u2019m retired. Talking,\
  \ walking,\u201D then he paused and gave me a sheepish smile, \u201Cand eating.\u201D\
  \n\nNo, I thought to myself. I should be the one thanking you."
