Text: "Riyadh, Saudi Arabia \u2013 A few minutes past four. My flight to Dubai now\
  \ has, let\u2019s see, a five-hour delay. Five-hour delay?!? This sucks! Who knows\
  \ when we\u2019ll depart. An airplane caught fire on the landing strip; fortunately,\
  \ no one got hurt but the airport has been closed since noon. No one is going anywhere\
  \ at the moment, and no one knows anything. Will getting angry make this airplane\
  \ leave any faster? No. I smile at the information desk agent who is in no position\
  \ to make any prediction. We smile at each other for no reason; he has braces and\
  \ a sheet of parsley (or maybe lettuce) stuck between his teeth. Gross. Half an\
  \ hour goes by and it feels like three hours. Ever had a layover at the airport\
  \ in Riyadh? It consists of kiosks that sell brightly colored food, monochromatic\
  \ coffee-cream colored walls and ceilings, a slippery floor with a boring geometric\
  \ design and a pain in the ass (my ass). I\u2019ve already checked my e-mail, finished\
  \ that urgent report, the online course and I\u2019ve counted all the floor tiles\
  \ in the airport. Fourteen thousand nine hundred and twelve. Three guys from who-knows-where\
  \ are playing Uno next to me. You know, that game with strange and colorful cards\
  \ when people have to shout \u201CUno!\u201D when they play their second last card.\
  \ The muezzin calls to prayer for the fourth time now. It\u2019s so hot outside\
  \ that even the sun is sweating and it\u2019s so cold inside it could start snowing!\
  \ A mixture of condensation and sand perspires from the windows. I chat with a Palestinian\
  \ man on his way to Jordan who leaves me (lucky him) with a \u201CGod bless you!\u201D\
  . I'm in a shity place and I should be really annoyed but, instead, I\u2019m happy\
  \ and start laughing. It\u2019s time! Nothing happens by chance. \nLet me explain.\
  \ \nSince my return to Dubai has apparently been postponed to the future perfect\
  \ (which is a future more in the future than the future itself), you know what I\u2019\
  m going to do? I\u2019m going to write a book. I\u2019ve been thinking about it\
  \ for a long time and what better time to begin that right now? I was really good\
  \ with numbers in school, but I always used to sweat bullets in literature class\
  \ just to get discouraging \u2018Ds\u2019. I used to run at the mere mention of\
  \ Greek or Latin. This is my revenge! Or could it be my surrender? Can you imagine?\
  \ Me? Writing a book?\nI\u2019ll get to the point. A year and a half ago, I kept\
  \ telling myself that I was happy. Then, I realized that I was lying to myself.\
  \ Consequently, during a suffocating July weekend I found the courage to turn my\
  \ life around and started traveling the world. For now, the one-eighty turn seems\
  \ to have been successful even though it was very difficult in the beginning, at\
  \ times even a mammoth task. I am a content and aspiring euphoric who is closer\
  \ to happiness than ever before. Many people complain about being unhappy or declare\
  \ they\u2019re stuck and then don\u2019t or are unable to do anything about it.\
  \ It would be amazing if sharing my experience during the past eighteen months could\
  \ be useful to someone to find the strength to dive into a new life. Are you free\
  \ tonight? What do you say if I invite you to dinner and tell you everything? I\u2019\
  m buying."
