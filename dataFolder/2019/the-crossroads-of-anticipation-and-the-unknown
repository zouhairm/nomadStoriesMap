Text: "\u201CMy brothers,\u201D said our guide. We were three people in a spacious\
  \ Land Cruiser in the Maasai Mara; for four days my wife and I were almost exclusively\
  \ the only guests at our safari camp\u2014the majority of tourists having abandoned\
  \ the area. \u201CThese cows\u2026?\u201D I puzzled, watching them chew their cud.\
  \ Minutes before we had witnessed a lioness guarding her two cubs as they played\
  \ and fed on an early-morning kill, the vehicle\u2019s open windows and sunroof\
  \ offering little protection from them. It took a moment to realize that Bundi\u2019\
  s frantic cellphone calls were about his brother\u2019s cattle and not about trying\
  \ to determine where other \u201Cbig five\u201D animals had been spotted\u2014which\
  \ is how he usually used his cell phone and CB radio. We were on the edge of the\
  \ Mara Naboisho Conservancy, a large swath of land leased from the Maasai to protect\
  \ a portion of the Kenyan ecosystem and allow free range of wildlife. A van drove\
  \ up and four young boys emerged, wielding long, thin sticks; they began to coax\
  \ the cattle to a safer location. Following another conversation on his phone, Bundi\
  \ drove us away, soon passing a few warthogs.  \u201CPumbaa!\u201D Bundi shouted,\
  \ referencing the lion king character. The warthogs scattered.\n\nMy wife and I\
  \ traveled to Kenya after a number of Al-Shabaab terror attacks had occurred\u2014\
  we had plans to visit friends in Nairobi, who would briefly host us before we set\
  \ out to various locations by ourselves, and the plans had been in jeopardy. The\
  \ terrorists held the country in fear for weeks; they would drive to small villages\
  \ in the eastern part of the country and would massacre the residents. Tourists\
  \ fled. The Mara was far removed from these horrific attacks and we had pushed through\
  \ with our plans, after weeks of anxious discussion and rescheduling.\n\nBundi didn\u2019\
  t reveal too much about himself, English not being his primary language, and my\
  \ limited Swahili being a mix of greetings and polite pleasantries. He knew a lot\
  \ about the savanna, his location in it, and the animals that lived there. \u201C\
  Topi!\u201D he would exclaim as we passed some now familiar large antelope with\
  \ distinctive leg coloration. \u201CBlue jeans, yellow socks!\u201D would complete\
  \ the thought, followed by laughter. He would guide us over washboard roads on what\
  \ appeared to be random routes carved around obstacles. The topography and tracks\
  \ were confusing\u2014our location a mystery. \u201CWhere is the camp?\u201D he\
  \ would ask. I would look at the position of the sun and think about the direction\
  \ we had been traveling, then point past a rise of small hills. \u201CNo,\u201D\
  \ he would respond, laughing yet again, and drive us forty yards in a different\
  \ direction to reveal our camp.\n\nWe had asked Bundi if it was possible to meet\
  \ with our nephew, Jake, who was in Kenya to complete his study abroad coursework\
  \ and was planning a safari. With the phone number of his driver, it could be possible.\
  \ Imagine that, a continent away from the States, and yet we might be able to see\
  \ a relative. An email from Jake provided the driver\u2019s number. Negotiations\
  \ were made and a time was set.\n\nDuring an afternoon trek, we stopped to watch\
  \ a family of elephants wallow in a small, muddy waterhole, and then continued through\
  \ yet another of the abundant herds of wildebeest and zebra. As we rounded a bend,\
  \ we saw a group of young people standing closely together outside a dust-covered\
  \ van, under the shadow of an acacia tree. An older driver stood nearby, on the\
  \ phone. \u201CWhere are we?\u201D I asked. \u201COne tree crossing\u2014where it\
  \ flooded,\u201D Bundi matter-of-factly replied. Jake was there, smiling.\n\nWe\
  \ look over our travel pictures from time to time, usually as we\u2019re planning\
  \ our next excursion, including one of a smiling group of three Mzungu and one Maasai.\
  \ The picture reminds me that fear should never be a stopping point in how, or when,\
  \ or where we should travel. Fear should guide thoughtfulness. If you can\u2019\
  t shake discomfort, then make other plans. But if the conditions are right, the\
  \ crossroads of anticipation and the unknown can reveal things unexpected, and special."
