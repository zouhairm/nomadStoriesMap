Text: "The story I'm about to tell you divides in 2 different trips: the first one\
  \ took place in September 2016 in Europe, I went on my first solo trip ever, I've\
  \ been to a lot of places by myself but there were always someone I knew at my destination\
  \ so it wasn't really a solo travel, but this time I knew noone, I was completely\
  \ by myself so I was really excited and nervous. I decided to buy a tour which is\
  \ only for people among 18-35 (I was 28 at the time) as an experience to get along\
  \ with people from all around the world. I was a little nervous as well because\
  \ the tour was all in english which is not my first language (I'm Mexican), but\
  \ it was the perfect occasion to practice it. The tour took place in 6 countries,\
  \ we started in Germany then Czech Republic, Austria, Hungary, Slovakia and Poland,\
  \ the trip lasted 11 days and in those 11 days I met awesome people from around\
  \ the world, there were mostly people from Australia, the tour company appears to\
  \ be really popular over there, and among those aussies there was a girl that I\
  \ really liked, her name is Alina. During the trip I had the chance to talk to almost\
  \ everyone in the tour (we were 50 people) but I really felt a connection with her\
  \ when we were the only ones at the back of the bus and we shared some really personal\
  \ stories, we were both broken hearted from our last relationship at the time so\
  \ we bonded really well by sharing those stories and our perspectives about it.\
  \ The trip went on and nothing happened between Alina and me but I was really satisfied\
  \ with my experience because I got to meet really interesting people. When I got\
  \ home I was a different person, some of my grief stayed in Europe and I was still\
  \ feeling excited because of the whole experience so I decided to book a flight\
  \ to Australia before the excitement of making new friends dissolved. This is where\
  \ the second part of this tale begins: This trip took place in april 2017, I was\
  \ so excited to see the aussies in Sidney, 10 of them plus one American friend managed\
  \ to gather one weekend in there to catch up and have fun, so we went out Friday\
  \ night to some pubs and clubs and everything was great, I had no intention whatsoever\
  \ to \u201Cmake a move\u201D or something with Alina but still I could sense some\
  \ spark between us, I took the things slow that night and just focused on having\
  \ fun with all of them remembering our time in Europe, the next day some of them\
  \ traveled back to their hometowns and there were only 6 of us left for another\
  \ 2 nights, Alina was still with the group, on Saturday morning we went to do some\
  \ sandboarding and visit some cool places around the coast, I started paying more\
  \ attention to her as I was decided to go for it that night, we went to a club that\
  \ night, a really cool one I\u2019d say, and things started to spice up, at the\
  \ end of the night we ended up making out on the elevator to our hotel and it was\
  \ awesome. The next day it was a little awkward at first because we were drunk when\
  \ all happened and the other guys were making jokes about it but on sunday night\
  \ (Alina's last night in Sidney) we all went have some dinner and after that Alina\
  \ and I got separated from the group and went next to the opera house where we were\
  \ kissing and hugging and saying sweet things to each other, holding hands and confessing\
  \ our mutual attraction, we went back to the hotel and spend the night together,\
  \ it was a really cool crush story that I will always cherish. We still talk once\
  \ in a while but for me it was the perfect holiday love story."
