Text: "I have a feeling of amazing with our beloved Indonesian Archaelogical sites\
  \ ... and i am dying to visiting one of the greatest Kingdom cultures in the archipelago\
  \ and even the world, namely the Majapahit Kingdom. I have never vacationed with\
  \ a cultural \"theme\" hehe ...\nUsually I go on vacation to the beach or tourist\
  \ attractions that hits and present plus has a great spot that is Instagramable\
  \ for me to display on my social media. This time I want to \"out of the box\" with\
  \ a vacation to the temples inherited from the Majapahit Kingdom, in Trowulan, Mojokerto,\
  \ East Java ... a fun route !! Well, my tourist destination this time to BAJANG\
  \ RATU Temple. Why am I going straight to this temple? Not to another temple for\
  \ example?\nAccording to my guide at that time, the 14th century Bajang Ratu Temple\
  \ functioned as an entrance for the sacred building to commemorate the death of\
  \ King Jayanegara and was used as the back door of the kingdom. This eventually\
  \ became a Culture in the Trowulan area if mourning the dead was required by the\
  \ back door ... interesting huh? Bajang Ratu itself means \"Defect King\", because\
  \ according to local legend, when the small Raja Jayanegara fell on this gate and\
  \ caused defects in his body, so this temple was called Bajang Ratu. This temple\
  \ is decorated with very beautiful reliefs ... really I can't understand how creative\
  \ our nation's artists are and how beautiful and rich the culture of Indonesia is\
  \ in the past and of course.Reliefs such as ornamental tendrils, lions, sun, legged\
  \ dragons, Garuda heads and one-eyed reliefs or Cyclops monocles ... according to\
  \ legend it functions as a protector and repellent for danger. For me, visiting\
  \ these beautiful temples is a form of loving the Nation and Country of Indonesia,\
  \ we should become a true Traveler by starting from loving our own Nation Culture\
  \ and proud of what is implied in it. Like the Bajang Ratu Temple which stands beautiful,\
  \ calm and amazing in the middle of a green and beautiful hill.\nThis temple was\
  \ established not without purpose, but to provide tranquility from a controlled\
  \ nature. When I entered the location of the Bajang Ratu Temple, time seemed to\
  \ be stopped ... only a roar of wind and sighs of leaves seemed to welcome me ...\
  \ the cool air and the wetness of leaves seemed to say that I would be fine here\
  \ ... dozens of flowers that bloom in beautiful colors -warni is also like waving\
  \ a welcome greeting ..I was so amazed and shivered and imagined 14 centuries ago\
  \ how beautiful the location is here and how calm the atmosphere is ... because\
  \ right now I feel the same way ...\nWell, speaking of events that are beyond reason\
  \ but must have happened in our lives right, I had the chance to believe and not,\
  \ but that was really beyond my understanding. That is when I pose for a selfie\
  \ on one of the Bajang Ratu Temple spots. At that time I was wearing a red shirt,\
  \ that's my fav one and I was taking pictures in front of the Bajang Ratu Temple.There\
  \ was nothing special in the photo when I saw my first selfie pose. But after I\
  \ was about to pose for my second selfie, right behind me on the stairs going up\
  \ to the temple, there was a woman who dressed like the princesses of the royal\
  \ era I saw in colossal soap operas such as Tutular Tinular, Angling Darma, and\
  \ others. That woman is beautiful. Really !! and she smiled like she wanted to take\
  \ a selfie with me .. Oh My God! And one more thing, according to local beliefs\
  \ circulating in the Trowulan community that a pamali (bad thing) for a government\
  \ official to cross or enter the gate of Bajang Ratu Temple, because it is believed\
  \ to bring bad luck ... uhmm so I never knew there are politicians campaigning around\
  \ here.. Well, Apart from all of these things, preserving Indonesian culture by\
  \ actively exploring Indonesia such as sharing tourist attractions that are cultural\
  \ contents, share Indonesian tourism as a destination its a must have things for\
  \ me beside other tourism destination around the worlds \U0001F60A"
