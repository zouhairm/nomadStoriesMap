Text: "Touring the South Island of New Zealand, what an amazing country! What amazed\
  \ me was the Southern Fjords of Milford Sound cruising along on a sunny day with\
  \ water spraying along the mountains and waterfalls making rainbows setting the\
  \ scene as if you were jumping into a postcard picture or painting, though I haven't\
  \ visited Norway - yet. \nAnother amazing part of New Zealand I particularly liked\
  \ was Dunedin. How Scottish could this city get? The castle in the style similar\
  \ to that of Edinburgh along with the landscape and gardens. Even many streets had\
  \ Scottish names e.g. \"Cowan Street\" where my family name  originates from. On\
  \ tour we were treated to a Scottish night with whiskey and a chance to try haggis,\
  \ but being a vegetarian, I passed on that one, but the whiskey went down well.\
  \ The only differences I noticed were the New Zealand accent and the Speights (local\
  \ beer) Brewery. \nOther than that I managed to view a variety of climates and landscapes\
  \ and it felt unusual to have February in Summer and the locals referred to the\
  \ Antarctic and not the Arctic. My overall experience of New Zealand was inspiring\
  \ and like being on the flip-side of the mirror - home from home."
