Text: "Today I was sitting inside a corporate office,  some job offers people had\
  \ for me.\nWell let me tell you this time it was completely different,  so different\
  \ from all other times I have  been to a corporate office, well you might think\
  \ why it is like that, and why I feel the way I feel, you might think that I am\
  \ talking something  which is not usual & orthodox, but I also feel tat if you are\
  \ reading this a majority of  readers will be able to relate to why I say this.\
  \ \nI must tell you that  I was a part of this corporate culture ever since I finished\
  \ my schooling and well in the earlier phrase of my career it looked like something\
  \ which excited me, to work in a corporate work culture, meeting different people\
  \ with different backgrounds & histories,\nto know their story was a big interest\
  \ for me .\nBut well I feel that God had some other plans for me,  I initially started\
  \ travelling as a means to escape from my monotonous corporate life , but once the\
  \ travel bug bit me(bit me really hard),  I was never the same again, I started\
  \ brainstorming ways on  how I can make my living  travelling.\nWell time passed\
  \ and I kept on procrastinating that right time is not now, and maybe I will do\
  \ it after I do certain things and take care of certain responsibilities, \nWell\
  \ that's where I was wrong as I was not living in the present & was instead  planning\
  \ too many things for future, before  I could actually take on the world, and proceed\
  \ with my gypsy adventures,  then one day finally I just left it all and listened\
  \ to my inner consciousness which was there all the time, but yes it took me a while\
  \ to hear and make out on  what it was shouting loudly to me( not just telling),\
  \ and well I decided to live in the present , I decided to say YES to the present\
  \ moment,and it was telling me to take a road less traveled, to travel the world\
  \ like Gypsies, too see the world in a way which not a lot of people have priviledge\
  \ to do so because they are always caught up with their responsibilities.\nAnd well\
  \ there I was in Kashi, the abode of Shiva finally calling it quit and well after\
  \ that day I never looked back, \nIt's been 5 months of me being on the road, slowly\
  \ travelling & making my way through the world,  letting it all sink in, taking\
  \ one step at a time,cherishing one destination at a time, befriends with people\
  \ all around the world & not just that I got to learn a lot of things which I didn't\
  \ knew or maybe might not have known were there in me all that time. \nI started\
  \ exploring myself. \nI started self discovery. \nI started being a Loner and well\
  \ I started loving this solitude time. \nNow those days of solitude and being a\
  \ loner while travelling pushed me to the path I am on today. \nAnd well can not\
  \ thank the divine enough for the same\nIt was a \"LEAP INTO THE UNKNOWN\" for me\
  \ and while heading out on this journey I had no idea on where this path will take\
  \ me,  I just trusted the path, the process and the divine to the fullest to get\
  \ me where I am today. \nAnd well many more gypsy years to come by. \nNow I am full\
  \ time Gypsy(Banarasee Gypsy) and live my life in a backpack on the road and this\
  \ is the lifestyle I desired & chose for myself. \nHence coming back to a corporate\
  \ world (don't worry I am not for sure going to stop my adventure), was just here\
  \ to meet some clients for some freelance offers they might have for me,  and even\
  \ though I know I will not be come back to this corporate life again but still my\
  \ conscience  gave me the chills on  when i think how I made my way out of this\
  \ cubicle,one step at a time, leaping into the unknown and now I am finally on my\
  \ Gypsy adventures around the world. Mahadev ! <3"
