Text: "I can be very optimistic. From helping out the confused girl at the airport\
  \ to giving free sweets for the girl who looked tired and stressed in a cafe, strangers\
  \ had never shied away from coming to my aid when they thought I needed it. This\
  \ has made a little more reckless than I should be. So here I am, one day after\
  \ I have landed in Seoul, South Korea, going out with my friends to shop for items\
  \ I might need for my four-month stay in the country. I didn't bother to charge\
  \ my phone, get a sim card, or learn the bus routes to my temporary residence. I\
  \ am thinking my friends probably know how to get around, and they did. This is\
  \ what I didn't imagine; I am carrying way too many items for my liking, and I am\
  \ walking much slower than both of my friends, they reach the bus stop as soon as\
  \ one of the buses pull over and get on the bus quickly, and then there's me, about\
  \ 20 meters behind, dreadfully watching as the bus door closes with my only means\
  \ of navigation inside it. \n\nIn my shock, I had forgotten to look at the bus number.\
  \ My phone, which doesn't have an internet connection, is at 3% at this point. \
  \ I look around to see if I could find something familiar, an I realize there is\
  \ nothing familiar because this is the very first time I am paying attention to\
  \ the scenery around me since I had arrived in the city. I look at the small stores\
  \ around, people walking, talking, everyone going about their lives, and even with\
  \ the shock of my situation, it is impossible not to acknowledge the beauty of it\
  \ all. It dawns on me that anyone I speak to and myself may not have any common\
  \ languages to communicate with; at this point, I am starting to panic. A woman\
  \ who was standing behind me suspects what's going on and offers to help. I show\
  \ her my address, and she tells me that her destination bus stop is past mine. So\
  \ we wait for the next bus together, and she tells me about herself, her family,\
  \ her life in and outside of Korea. The bus arrives, we get on the bus, and the\
  \ conversation continues, to my surprise her profession is one I want to pursue\
  \ myself. She gives me her address and tells me to reach out to her with any questions\
  \ I  might have, both about my studies and the city and says that I need to get\
  \ off on the next stop. I say goodbye to her, and I do just that. \n\nI still don't\
  \ recognize anything about where I am. Its a hill at what seems to be the outskirts\
  \ of the city. At this point, I think I gave her the wrong address. So I sit on\
  \ the floor putting all my stuff next to me. From where I am sitting I can see most\
  \ of the city, and the sun looks like an orange ball hanging on an invisible string,\
  \ about to fall on the tall buildings of Seoul. And its one of the most breathtaking\
  \ views I have ever seen. I am not the only person pausing life to take in the image;\
  \ two girls stand beside me and take photos of the scenery. I smile and say hello\
  \ to the strangers. They say hello and ask me how I am doing. I narrate the events\
  \ of the day and how I can't seem to find my way back home. Seeing that I can't\
  \ navigate my way home, they offer to accompany me. We start walking together to\
  \ my house, and talk about coffee and our lives; we arrive at the door of my building;\
  \ I thank them, take their phone number and wish them a safe trip home. As I am\
  \ wave goodbye, I realize, I am as alone as I am mindless; a smile, a conversation\
  \ that was all it took to find a mentor, two friends, and my way home. I think I\
  \ am going to love this country."
