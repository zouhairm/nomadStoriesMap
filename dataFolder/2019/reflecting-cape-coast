Text: "Breathing was tedious as I stood in the low air quality, humidity stricken\
  \ basement; envisioning cramped decaying bodies and eerie moans of mixed languages\
  \ echoing throughout the halls of the castle. I peeked my head through the Door\
  \ of No Return imagining the many who were stripped away from the only home they\
  \ knew. My roots would drag on the bottom of their feet and soon perish in the presence\
  \ of the southern heat. Hours later, I sat on the beach of Cape Coast suppressing\
  \ lingering emotions with fish burgers and plantains as the glaring rays of the\
  \ Ghanaian sun bathed me. \n\nDays later, I stood in an outdoor classroom in a village\
  \ near Winneabea. The students keenly asked me questions on life in America. The\
  \ lingering excitement in their voices, forced me to conceive the notion that at\
  \ some point in their lives they were given the wrong definition of what it meant\
  \ to be African American. I tried to explain that it was nowhere close to knowing\
  \ where you come from \u2013 but they didn\u2019t understand. Many people did not,\
  \ but that is quite reasonable. How can you understand someone with no past, when\
  \ you have so much history? I constantly found myself greeted by the question, \u201C\
  Where are you from?\u201D I would answer, \u201Cthe United States\u201D and a puzzling\
  \ look would emerge. \u201CNo, what part of Africa are you from?\u201D The puzzling\
  \ look would then transfer to my face, as I thought deeply on the African which\
  \ stood concretely in front of my American."
