Text: "Hard to believe this was only four-hundred metres from Plaza Mayor. There,\
  \ framed by the myriad columns and balconies of the square, street performers dressed\
  \ as glittering goats and vendors peddling birdsong whistles do their bit to poach\
  \ the tourists. Conversely, this patch of Old Madrid sits quiet, swaddled in tightly-packed\
  \ blocks. We had come here for the \u2018nun sweets\u2019.\n\nWithin a red-brick\
  \ building harking back to the seventeenth century, whose only windows were three\
  \ storeys above ground, stood a large entrance with Gothic metal studs and a headdress\
  \ of intricate masonry. I spotted a lone tile with the number three and an arrow\
  \ pointing right. The way to the nuns was guarded by an unassuming, if beautifully\
  \ carved, wooden door. Outside it was an elderly, Santa-bearded man stabbing a buzzer\
  \ with his finger. He was yelling.\n\nMy limited Spanish couldn\u2019t catch his\
  \ complaint. But a beggar, who had been sitting on a stool nearby, came to offer\
  \ her assistance. They spoke at speed and at length, she trying in vain to calm\
  \ him down. It appeared the nuns were slow to answer his call. The door buzzed open,\
  \ and in he went with a huff.\n\n\u2018Should we follow?\u2019 I asked my husband,\
  \ Chris.\n\n\u2018Entran,\u2019 said the beggar. In her floral print dress and headscarf,\
  \ gesturing, with an air that mixed nonchalance and long-suffering, she reminded\
  \ me of any number of grandmothers I\u2019d known in my native Cyprus. I immediately\
  \ took a shine to her.\n\nWe entered the convent. We followed the echoing, fading\
  \ ramblings of the elderly man as he tapped his stick along the corridor to an indoor\
  \ patio, where potted palms rose to conceal grilled windows in yellow walls. On\
  \ the way, the man paused, turned to hold a hand up at us, and carried on. We stopped,\
  \ but we also didn\u2019t want to lose him. We continued.\n\nHe now stood shouting\
  \ at a wooden window, from the other side of which came a female voice. Though she\
  \ remained cool while he raged, their overlapping words became a thicket. What was\
  \ clear was that he had not found whatever it was he was searching for, and he stormed\
  \ off, still yelling, \u2019til the peace of the convent swallowed him up. We were\
  \ now alone, with no correct example of how to approach the nuns.\n\n\u2018Hola,\u2019\
  \ came the sweet voice on the other side of the window \u2013 which was, it transpired,\
  \ a wooden board.\n\nThe nuns of the Corpus Christi convent are not allowed contact\
  \ with the outside world, hence this unusual setup of buzzer, admittance, blind\
  \ purchase. We were here to buy sweets; in particular an egg-yolk shortbread that\
  \ we\u2019d heard was the convent\u2019s specialty. This was the way in which these\
  \ cloistered brides of God could eke their living.\n\n'Don\u2019t bother going to\
  \ Madrid,' had read the DM on my Instagram, sent from a Barcelona-based, self-styled\
  \ travel expert. 'It\u2019s boring.' Before Chris and I had set off to see for ourselves,\
  \ that was the lie we\u2019d been fed too.\n\n'I like history, culture, architecture\
  \ and food,' I\u2019d written back.\n\n'Oh,' had been the reply.\n\nWhen I first\
  \ heard about these sweets, acquired in this method, my mind was made up: one day\
  \ I would go to Madrid and resolutely find it not-boring.\nNow that I was face-to-board\
  \ with a nun, I hesitated. Staring at the Spanish-English menu, I was thrown by\
  \ the options of lemon, almond and sherry-flavoured treats. In a panicked outburst,\
  \ I ordered half a kilo of sherry. Almost immediately I realised my error, and yelled\
  \ the correct order. These poor secluded sisters, confronted by all these noisy\
  \ men.\n\nI placed a ten-euro note on the Lazy Susan and watched it disappear into\
  \ darkness. It transformed into a box of egg-yolk shortbread dusted with icing sugar.\n\
  \n\u2018Dios te bendiga.\u2019\n\n\u2018Gracias, adios!\u2019\n\nOutside, blinking\
  \ at the sudden light, we found the beggar sitting on her stool. We put some coins\
  \ in her open palm. Smiling, she thanked us with a matchbox-sized card depicting\
  \ the Virgin Mary, as if we needed any further blessing."
