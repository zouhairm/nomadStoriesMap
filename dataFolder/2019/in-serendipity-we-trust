Text: "A decade ago, I was touring the North of Italy for the first time as a solo\
  \ traveler by train, and I arrived in Venice very early on November 22nd, Saint\
  \ Cecilia\u2019s day. As soon as I set foot outside the train station, a ray of\
  \ morning sun illuminated a poster on the wall announcing a concert of The Four\
  \ Seasons, to be performed that night by a virtuosi string ensemble in \u201CVivaldi\u2019\
  s Church\u201D. So, I set off to discover Venice and my mission was to try and find\
  \ that church in order to buy tickets for the evening. Silly me, though, I got so\
  \ excited about the plan of celebrating my namesake\u2019s day, the patron saint\
  \ of music, by attending that concert that I did not pay attention to the name of\
  \ the church in Italian. The result was that I got lost in a maze of magical winding\
  \ streets and bridges and wandered blissfully for hours, stopping now and then to\
  \ ask for directions to get to Vivaldi\u2019s Church, but it seemed no one had ever\
  \ heard about such a place. Anyway, I made my way to a beaming Piazza San Marco\
  \ under pristine blue skies, and as I turned onto the Grand Canal terrace, festooned\
  \ with pizza place tables under a canopy of colorful umbrellas, I decided to give\
  \ my hiking boots a rest and sit down for lunch. To my surprise when I looked around\
  \ to determine which restaurant was the perfect match for my stomach mood, I realized\
  \ I was standing just outside the box office with the poster announcing the concert\
  \ to take place there, at Chiesa della Piet\xE1, where Vivaldi used to work almost\
  \ three centuries ago. \nThe next day, the owner of my bed and breakfast instructed\
  \ me on how to combine vaporettos and traghettos, since she was adamant that a day\
  \ trip to Murano was a must. Obediently, off I went, and following my landlady's\
  \ orders, I made my wide-eyed way and landed in a mesmerizing stained-glass bubble\
  \ of an island called Murano. When in Rome do as Romans do, they say, so when in\
  \ Murano, go to the old furnace and enjoy the unique art of glass blowers. As it\
  \ turns out, I ended up in the premises that also comprise a museum, where amazing\
  \ works signed by renowned glass artists are exhibited, which seamlessly leads to\
  \ the gift shop and, luckily, to a quaint little Italian trattoria.\nThe restaurant\
  \ was just the ticket since I got there in time for a late lunch. My hungry eyes\
  \ scanned the bilingual menu and got captivated by the piatto del giorno, which\
  \ was the only item without a translation into English. Sure, I could understand\
  \ \u2018risotto\u2019 and with the help of a friendly waiter I figured out the stars\
  \ of the recipe were artichokes and scallops. Oh, what an excellent choice! I have\
  \ no words to describe how delicious that was but I suspect my face gave me away\
  \ because when I looked up to order a second bread basket, my eyes met the sweet\
  \ face of an older lady, sitting with her party of 8 in a long table next to mine,\
  \ smiling at me.  She made a gesture to inquire about my happy meal, and having\
  \ heard her British accent in an exchange with her family as they arrived, I said\
  \ in English: \u201CIt\u2019s the menu du jour. Artichoke and scallops risotto.\
  \ Sooo good\u201D, and turned back to my plate with a grin of satisfaction. A minute\
  \ later, she called the waiter and I heard her soft voice again: \u201CWe are going\
  \ to have what she is having. Eight risottos, please\u201D. I felt that was my influencer\
  \ moment, right out of When Harry Met Sally in Katz Delicatessen in NYC, minus the\
  \ orgasm scene."
