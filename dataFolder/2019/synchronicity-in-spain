Text: "\u201CNisha!\u201D She got out of the car and ran towards me with outstretched\
  \ arms. I froze, disbelieving that my thoughts had invoked my Spanish angel, who\
  \ I was thinking about! If either of us had been seconds faster, we would have missed\
  \ each other.  \n\nI met her and her cousin during my first week walking the Camino\
  \ del Norte last year. I spoke no Spanish, and they spoke no English, but we could\
  \ have dinner together in the company of Google Translate.  \n\nI under-estimated\
  \ how much more planning for the Norte I would need to do, compared to the Camino\
  \ Frances which I had walked before. I assumed it would be just as straightforward\
  \ as turning up, following the yellow arrows, and stopping at the many towns which\
  \ would have a dorm bed, a church floor, or a country house for me to sleep at for\
  \ the night. \n\nWrong. The Norte was harder with longer distances between towns\
  \ and beds, and a lot of steep ups and downs, for this was a coastal walk. Also,\
  \ I discovered, it was hard to see the arrows when you emerged from a forested area\
  \ into a big city, like San Sebastian. This was exactly what I experienced, at 5pm\
  \ on my first walking day on the Norte. \n\nI had walked since 8am and could not\
  \ fathom Google Maps. I decided to look for \u201Chuman arrows\u201D ahead \u2013\
  \ walkers with haversacks, walking sticks and camino shells. I spotted the cousins\
  \ buying ice cream from a pushcart along the San Sebastian waterfront. I caught\
  \ up with them and asked where they planned to spend the night. They whipped out\
  \ internet-print outs of the Norte guide from www.gronze.com and pointed to a private\
  \ hostel. They asked if I had a bed for the night, and I shook my head. They discussed\
  \ among themselves, whipped out a phone and called the hostel to reserve a bed for\
  \ me, without me asking them to. I was thankful and fell in step, meekly, with them.\
  \ \n\nThe next day while walking, they approached me from behind, with looks of\
  \ concern, clicking their tongues and speaking in Spanish before digging into their\
  \ bags and pushing a stash of Compeed into my hands. \u201CFor my blisters\u201D\
  , they said, and waved me off when I attempted to return it to them.\n2 days later,\
  \ we ended up having breakfast at an albergue in Olatz, in the middle of the woods\
  \ on a steep hill. They saw me listlessly poking at my breakfast and eating little.\
  \ They discussed in Spanish again, and then pushed a ham bocadillo (sandwich) into\
  \ my hand. \u201CNo, no!! Please, don\u2019t worry! I\u2019ll get my lunch at a\
  \ bar on the way!\u201D They smiled and told me to take it anyway. \n\nAfter walking\
  \ uphill consistently for 5 hours with no open bar anywhere, I finally understood\
  \ why they passed me the sandwich. They knew there was not going to be a bar, and\
  \ it was going to be the \u201CGrand Prix of Uphills\u201D on our way to Markina\
  \ Xemein.\n \nI sat on the grass patch, removed my socks and shoes to air my poor,\
  \ feet and looked at the sandwich in my hands. It dawned on me that they were my\
  \ Spanish angels! On day 1, they gave me a roof over my head. On Day 2, they healed\
  \ me, and today, they fed me! \n\nA few days later, I bumped into them at a bar\
  \ during a walking pitstop and bought them gin and tonics to express my heartfelt\
  \ thanks for the exquisite, Spanish kindness they showed me. They handed me a flyer\
  \ for an albergue that their family was planning to open at Cobreces, along the\
  \ Camino del Norte. \n\nOne year later, I was in awe at this synchronistic moment\
  \ as I stood outside Albergue El Pino in Cobreces for the first time. I was in a\
  \ country of 46 million, more than 11,000kms from Singapore, running into a specific\
  \ person I had met on the transient Camino del Norte one year ago. It could have\
  \ been another permutation. We could have been anywhere else, but we met there,\
  \ at the exact geographic co-ordinates and time."
