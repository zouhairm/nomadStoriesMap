Text: "\"Kosovo in the 90\u2019s was more habitable than this\", mutters my hardened,\
  \ ex-army captain chaperone as he drops my luggage to the floor. \u201CGood luck\u201D\
  \ he chuckles, hurrying away to leave me in a state of shock.\n \nI wasn\u2019t\
  \ used to this. I wasn\u2019t expecting this. This was not the corporate travel\
  \ I had grown accustomed to, staying in Hiltons and Marriott\u2019s. Sure, it was\
  \ Abidjan, capital of C\xF4te d\u2019Ivoire but not everywhere in the city was like\
  \ this, surely?\n \nMy first clue should have been the bumpy drive along the dirt\
  \ track roads where the number plates were painted on. Or the hundreds of children\
  \ playing football next to the highway, ignoring the roaring traffic and occasional\
  \ cow that would interrupt their pitch.\n \nNo, there had to be some mistake. Crossing\
  \ the cold, hard concrete floor, I study the peeling yellow wallpaper and the furniture\
  \ rotting from the inside. There\u2019s a smell of damp and cigarettes assaulting\
  \ my nostrils. Glancing down at the bed and, aside from a small black stain, it\u2019\
  s actually not too bad, perfect for what I need. However, as I get closer, the dirt\
  \ stain shoots across the bed! I freeze. It\u2019s a cockroach. And then, this noise\
  \ it makes as it scurries off, almost like a knife scraping against a plate but\
  \ at a higher pitch, laughing at me. \n \nNope, I\u2019m done!\n \nNow, I\u2019\
  m not a snob or anything but after seventeen hours of travel, I did not expect to\
  \ be sharing my room with vermin. There must have been a mistake.\n \nI ring the\
  \ head of events back in the UK. 10 minutes and a hefty phone bill later, my denial\
  \ was rebuked. This was the correct hotel, \u201CLive with it, It\u2019s Africa\
  \ baby\u201D.\n \nGreat. I\u2019m stuck here! \n \nWhilst on the phone, I counted\
  \ several more uninvited roommates. The screech of the roaches mocking me as if\
  \ they knew I was their dinner for the night. I see red. And so begins the second\
  \ stage, rage!\n \nI start chasing the critters around the room, their shrieks all\
  \ around me. I\u2019m stomping and jumping on them, or, at least trying, but they\u2019\
  re too fast. When I do land a blow it only attracts more; a squashed cockroach releases\
  \ pheromones that entice others. Looking back across my room, my no man\u2019s land,\
  \ I see hundreds of the little fiends sprint away.\n \nI\u2019m defeated. I\u2019\
  m tired. I want to sleep. So begins the lowest stage. I get on my knees. I beg for\
  \ the cockroaches to leave me alone. Then\u2026 I realise that even if they do understand\
  \ humans, they\u2019d probably only speak French\u2026idiot.\n \nNext, a bout of\
  \ depression and despair kicks in. \u201CWhy am I here?\u201D. \u201CI\u2019m stuck\
  \ in a room with cockroaches\u201D. \u201CThey\u2019re going to eat me alive\u201D\
  . It\u2019s an embarrassing twenty minutes.\n \nAfter a few more pathetic, pity\
  \ tears are shed, I realise there\u2019s nothing more I can do. I\u2019m too tired\
  \ to care. I just want to sleep. I climb into bed, only noticing for the first time\
  \ the gaping hole above the headboard; definitely the porthole to the cockroach\
  \ universe. I consider blocking it but then, what would be the point, they\u2019\
  d find a way through.\n \nI\u2019m sure I read cockroaches prefer the dark so I\
  \ leave the lights on and wear an eye mask. Just before closing my eyes, I spy a\
  \ cockroach scamper across the bottom of my bed. I realise how vulnerable my body\
  \ is to attack, how tasty my skin would be or how inviting certain, orifices are.\
  \ Terrifying thoughts flash through my brain. I tuck the sheet as tight as I can\
  \ underneath me.\n\nThe last thing I hear before I put my ear plugs in is a chorus\
  \ of screams, a war cry to strike fear into the enemy. \u201CStaaaaaaaaan\u201D\
  \ I\u2019m sure I hear them say. My mouth will be vulnerable throughout the night-time\
  \ but there\u2019s nothing I can do. A dose of Protein at least? As I settle down\
  \ and prepare for sleep, I\u2019m sure I can feel hoards of scuttling legs marching\
  \ across the sheets.\n \nI just had to take a plunge, hope for the best and pray\
  \ the bed bugs don\u2019t bite."
