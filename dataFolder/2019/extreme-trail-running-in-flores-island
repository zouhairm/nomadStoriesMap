Text: "Last summer, I was in the easternmost point of Europe, trying to take as long\
  \ as possible to cross the continent mostly by land and sea to get to its westernmost\
  \ point, one of Europe\u2019s most remote and secluded corners. It took me several\
  \ months to get across the Atlantic, island hopping, stopping to see friends and\
  \ family along the way. Getting to the end of the Earth requires some perseverance.\n\
  Finally, in an overcast windy day in November, I boarded a small plane that was\
  \ headed to Flores island in the Azores, a small island with roughly 4,000 inhabitants,\
  \ located in the middle of the north Atlantic Ocean, two thousand kilometres from\
  \ Lisbon. Looming out of the airplane window, over the ocean and out of sight, was\
  \ America, land of promises for many of my ancestors, \u201CCalifornia of abundance\u201D\
  , as a celebrated poet named it six decades ago. As we descended towards Flores\
  \ island the small jet was shaking due to strong lateral winds, and, for a moment,\
  \ I looked at the scared face of the person sitting next to me. Being from Flores\
  \ island means expecting turbulent landings, ugly weather, big delays and the last\
  \ place in any competition.\nOutside the aircraft, Flores island felt quiet. Since\
  \ its colonization 500 years ago, the island has always been too isolated to feel\
  \ the influence of the world events, and too small to generate much agitation of\
  \ its own. Life on such a place is necessarily tranquil.\nNowadays, it still requires\
  \ some planning to visit the island, especially in the summer months when housing\
  \ options can get fully booked. Though not easy to reach by any means, the island\
  \ is now much more accessible than it was some years ago, partly due to better airplane\
  \ connections to the other islands (and from there to Europe and the US) and to\
  \ a few small lodges opening in the west coast. \nThis time I was back in Flores\
  \ Island to participate in a new trail-running competition, the Extreme West Atlantic\
  \ Trail, a punishing trek that stretches 40 kilometres through mountainous terrain.\
  \ The morning of the day of the race brought relentless rain and wind, and as a\
  \ consequence, the temperature felt too low for these latitudes. Many times during\
  \ the race I had to grab whatever was close to my hand, sometimes a royal fern or\
  \ a stone wall, other times a fellow runner, to steady myself against the gusting\
  \ wind. \nAfter two and a half hours fighting the elements and physically exhausted,\
  \ I got to the central plateau of the island, where I took a detour, as I often\
  \ do, and stepped away from the trail. I stood in a side track, some hydrangea bushes\
  \ separating me from the other competitors running nearby. \nAt this point, the\
  \ morning mist was lifting in the volcanic crater lakes and I could see the water\
  \ from the waterfalls being carried up in the air by the wind. Looking from a distance,\
  \ the familiar scenery composed of dense native heather and juniperus forest, and\
  \ old brick walkways and dry-stone walls, gave the impression of a place lost in\
  \ time.\nFor decades, I had been running from the fury of the sea that can trap\
  \ us for days, the violent sky and the isolation, flying to distant places, the\
  \ farthest the better. Unexpectedly, the things that I used to loath felt less punitive.\
  \  I was at the heart of the island where I was born in, and for a very brief and\
  \ wondrous moment, I just stood still, not caring to go somewhere, taking the elements,\
  \ feeling the exhilarating excitement of being alive there at that moment in time.\
  \ Some people say there\u2019s something mystical about the island. I wouldn\u2019\
  t know about that, but I believe there\u2019s hidden truths on the sides of its\
  \ main roads.\nI continued running for a few kilometres more, until the next fuel\
  \ stop. But I guess in the end this journey wasn\u2019t about the race, which I\
  \ quit, six kilometres from the finish line. Maybe this time I wanted to come home,\
  \ to find my place in the world and take care of it."
