Text: "The \u201CSantos Hoyos\u201D is a secret, password-encoded, gay, monastery-themed\
  \ bathhouse located in a two-story, rundown building at the top of a hill in the\
  \ outback of the town of Tlatlauquitepec in Puebla, Mexico. \nThe front wooden door\
  \ clutches a neon sign in the shape of a cross that flickers as soon as nightfall\
  \ drapes the peak of the mountain and shines in phosphorescent, violet slabs piercing\
  \ through the oceanic darkness, like a beacon of light guiding lost sinners home.\
  \ \nThe ushers are dressed like Carmelite nuns and kerosene lamps hang from the\
  \ ceiling indicating the way in. The entrance fee is a hundred and twenty pesos,\
  \ and it includes the keys for a private chamber for the night, and an assigned\
  \ locker where to stash your clothes; a clean, white towel, and a mandatory red\
  \ votive candle you MUST light up for \"Santa Verga\" (St. Dong), \u201Cpatron for\
  \ the destitute anuses\u201D, before you go through the \u201Csacred threshold\u201D\
  : a bejeweled curtain that rattles and glitters in spasms and separates the paying\
  \ booth from the locker room. \n\nThe town of Tlatlauquitepec is referred to by\
  \ its inhabitants as the freezer or the icebox, chiefly due to the Artic breaths\
  \ of wind and flapping penguins snuggled in-between the swirls and whorls of the\
  \ morning mist. \nThe thickest of mists came barreling into town from secret compartments\
  \ of the hills at wee hours of the night, undulating over the tin roofs like luminous\
  \ white Chinese dragons, ravenously swallowing the scarecrows standing on the fields\
  \ and the spirals of the convents towering over the sky, and launching a thousand\
  \ ships of dampness that sneaked into every household through rafts and keyholes\
  \ to slaughter whatever warmth provided by the dying embers of decayed hearths was\
  \ still left frolicking in the beds and pillows. \nThe dampness in this town was\
  \ an animal that pawed its way to the center of your dreams. \nThe stooped edifice\
  \ of the \"Santos Hoyos\" was crammed in like an ingrown toenail between a dilapidated,\
  \ older-than-God-himself church, and a third-class hole-in-the-wall cantina that\
  \ only served fireball whiskey and frosted aguardiente. \nThe church stood to the\
  \ left like a dog-tired creature, slanting in crushing degrees against the left\
  \ side of the bathhouse as if on purpose, both to lean in and drop a tidbit of its\
  \ staggering heavy centuries upon the roof of thy neighbor and rest its old-age\
  \ cement joints, and at the same time, to take advantage of this bending position\
  \ to peer in through the windowpanes and spy and judge the whirligig of naked bodies\
  \ strolling about inside this shelter of gratuitous carnal exposure. A convoy of\
  \ cracked steps spilled out from the creaking, oval gates of the church, like the\
  \ rolling, parched tongue of a thirsty animal. The two dwarfed, bowed towers, ironically\
  \ looking like horns garnishing a wicked head, were wrapped in ravines and creepers\
  \ that twisted upon each other and gave way to glittering beetles and scorpions\
  \ that slipped through the cracks of the walls and that most often than not you\
  \ had to squash with the heavy, leathery First communion practice Bible concealed\
  \ at your feet with a loud thud that bounced like a scream trapped in a vault before\
  \ stationing your buttocks on one of the pews. \nI went to this town attempting\
  \ a soul-searching journey, and found this bathhouse where every night for a month\
  \ I went to fall asleep. This was four months after my boyfriend had overdosed and\
  \ I could not stand the stillness of our apartment in Mexico City without his presence.\
  \ A parade of hungry insomniacs gathered together in this household of stimulation\
  \ tucked me into bed every night, and sang sweet lullabies of moans and groans that\
  \ swallowed the night away. A jungle of uncluttered eyes and wicked dreams made\
  \ the rooms shake. And it was among this group of creatures, inside this place of\
  \ sodomy, where I ultimately found the peaceful slumber I longed for after countless\
  \ starless nights that filled my sleep with nightmares where I saw myself entering\
  \ a butcher shop and asking for my own heart wrapped in cellophane paper."
