Text: "One day, on the cruisline. Sea shore blasting the noice of joy. Birds chirping\
  \ the night before the sky. It was not paradise. As the theme of the vacation was\
  \ paradoxed; in the meantime, I ate and I ate and I ate. I drank and drank and I\
  \ felt amazing. Lights, cameras. Action. None of this amused my soul purpose. Next\
  \ morning, I woke up. Starring deep into the mirror I reached into my pocket and\
  \ there was a note, big bright in bold. \"I love you. I took a look and that was\
  \ my next trial. A ship full of 10,000 people, and all in all I was looking for\
  \ self loath. It's a mission.\n\nGetting up quicker then the speed of a bullet,\
  \ we're talking the bullet of a desert eagle; slick slim accuracy so undifiable\
  \ its riddle. its double oh seven time as I relapsed. I felt the need to accomplish\
  \ the impossible. I changed the topic: The matrix. Nope it was not direct enough,\
  \ the avengers it is two thousand and nineteen. Anyway, it took me about 4 hours\
  \ to find my motivation and the common courtesy to get out of my room to search\
  \ ten thousand people at a time on the written adjective of love. \n\nIt still wasn't\
  \ enough motivation to search, so I went back into the dorm of my room took a non-comfotable\
  \ seat and sat looking at the creases of the ceiling height. It was not stars, nor\
  \ dreams; it independently was not the milky way. But, to me it was everything I\
  \ could ever imagine it was my impression of my family. My husband. My mom. Myself,\
  \ 10 years down the line.  Undiscovered today. Rediscovered tomorrow.\n\nAnyway,\
  \ my point of absence is unnecessary and back to reality we go. My room. ghostly\
  \ and an insulting silence. And ofcourse my trashed out breath from the party before.\
  \ It was then and there I had to first brush the lungs and the teeth. It was not\
  \ garlic and was the scent of love. Disgusting! I cleaned up showered, read a quick\
  \ magazine, matter a fact a very quick magazine. Now I was ready to go.\n\nI got\
  \ up excitedly for no reason at all because in my heart I knew love does not exist.\
  \ Relationships to me, it is what it is. Work get paid and go. It's nothing. So,\
  \ in that case of scenario I finally got out the door. Looking down at the watch\
  \ it was dark again. The silicon valley is once again becoming dark.\n\nBack to\
  \ the bar I shuffled the lining of my soberly dressed lining ready for the rembarance\
  \ of the previously famous blacked out evening, the love of my life.\n\nHere we\
  \ go, as I took a seat greeted the bar tender. He looked at me like i was some sort\
  \ of a king, I dont recognize looks but this one seemed vivid. In any means, he\
  \ greeted and said \"welcome back ms\" with a big smile on his face. I consider\
  \ myself an expert at greetings so unasked this man poor me 7 shots of last night.\
  \ Once more he said \"keep on breaking records madam, your well know we all adore\
  \ you!\" \n\nI left because I was unsure what to say because I dont like relationships\
  \ with anyone what's so ever. I took one approximate shot and left.\n\nDamn right\
  \ I was dizzy I can reasure you I dislike people. Back to the room I walked with\
  \ a fast pace, i truly missed my magazine.\n\nAs enter the loneliness I realized\
  \ that I left the note right on the countertop of the seat that I read my magazine,\
  \ I took a look. Those sequences of scribbles were the same page i ripped out the\
  \ magazine with the same pen i had with the same signature i wrote.\n\nI become\
  \ fond of myself, reading that magazine quiet and ready to get dressed to mix and\
  \ mingle. I am ready for a relationship. I love myself.\n\n(Note no edit)))))))***"
