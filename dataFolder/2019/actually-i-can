Text: "12.08.2018\n\nI love you. Big words, with lots of meaning for me. Whenever\
  \ I say the words, I mean them. I don\u2019t say it because I have to fit it, because\
  \ I have to please someone, I just mean them with my entire heart. \nLast night\
  \ definitely taught me one important lesson: we\u2019ve got different perspectives\
  \ when it comes to love. We come from 2 completely different backgrounds, cultures,\
  \ but most important we know to love in such a different way. \nYou always tell\
  \ me that you are not worth it. Why I let you hurt me that much? Why I don\u2019\
  t stop things when I\u2019ve got all the reasons. \nI finally got an answer to your\
  \ question. Because I love you. Don\u2019t read them words without a meaning. When\
  \ I say \u201CI love you\u201D I mean strong feelings, joy, smile on my face, tears,\
  \ anger, disappointment, fear, everything that\u2019s good and bad too. \nThis is\
  \ the way I see love. For me love comes in stages.\n1. You\u2019ve got the first\
  \ stage which is a little bit more of attraction and innocent feelings mixed with\
  \ curiosity. \n2. Stage two: I find all your positives and I fall in love with them\
  \ and I just want to discover more and more and more. I only see you with good eyes\
  \ and I refuse to think you\u2019ve got any bad side. \n3. Stage three: I can see\
  \ all your imperfections and wickednesses, but I embrace them. I accept you as a\
  \ total. I love your bad side as much as I love your good one. I don\u2019t wanna\
  \ change you. I might try to help you by showing you another perspective, but nothing\
  \ more.\nI used to get angry every single time when you were asking me that question.\
  \ But I have to be honest: it was for the best. Because I know where I\u2019m standing\
  \ and what kind of feelings I\u2019ve got for you. \nI love you! And by that I mean\
  \ my heart stops for a second because the feeling it\u2019s too strong. There is\
  \ no way to make you understand that\u2019s the way I feel. And I don\u2019t think\
  \ I wanna try to prove it anymore. I just hope that one day you\u2019ll see yourself\
  \ through my eyes."
