Text: "I expected to find a nit comb. I really did. \n\nI\u2019d been frantically\
  \ searching  this city for a tiny, basic component that I could find in ASDA within\
  \ seconds. But apparently, Vietnam\u2019s capital city, Hanoi has\u2019t heard of\
  \ such a thing. Fist I tried the doctors, a visit that cost me a bargain of $100.\
  \ The doctor prescribed me a bottle of shampoo that cost 19,000 VND- or in GBP terms:\
  \ 62p. \u201CI already have this shampoo\u201D I protested, \u201CI need a comb\
  \ because ( as my mum had repeatedly told me) shampoo\u2019s not good enough, you\
  \ need to comb out the eggs!\u201D. The doctor bode me luck before offering his\
  \ own personal advice; \u201Cdon\u2019t shave your head\u201D. Leaving the clinic\
  \ during a monsoon, drenched and $100 poorer, me and my nits hoped on a uber bike\
  \ and headed to the Old Quarter. \n\nThe Old Quarter is a magnet for tourists of\
  \ various ages and nationalities.  Despite the bustling crowds of visitors and hostel\
  \ pub crawls, the town has managed to preserve its natural charm. The locals are\
  \ friendly to and intrigued by foreigners. Yet the magic of the old quarter is prevalent\
  \ without the tourism. The locals go about their business, weaving in and out of\
  \ the chaotic traffic, often resting on their plastic stools, sipping their innocuously\
  \ refreshing  tr\xE0 \u0111\xE1\_ whilst observing the unique, Hanoi life. \n\n\
  \  I weave through bikes, flower ladies and backpackers to find a \u201Chair shop\u201D\
  .  It essentially is a cabin that holds everything to with hair care. There were\
  \ shampoos of \u2018cosco\u2019 dimensions, assortments of conditioners, headbands\
  \ of every colour, brushes compact and large, hair dyes and wigs but to my exasperation,\
  \ no nit comb. Not to worry, I shall try Time City. \n\nYes Time City is my beacon\
  \ of hope.Times City is an innovative part of Hanoi where international schools,\
  \ hospitals, language centres, malls reside. If Hanoi holds a nit comb, Time City\
  \ has it. \n\nThe Time City pharmacy was very good. It had medicine of all varieties,\
  \ It had necessary toiletries but the only \u2018comb\u2019 in stock was just suitable\
  \ enough for a barbie doll. \n\nI hopped on my final bike of the day and went home.\
  \ The tears poured incessantly. Two months abroad and I felt defeated. Travelling\
  \ is not for me, it is something that belongs to an elite group of people, people\
  \ who have 1000 Instagram followers, people who are permanently sun kissed, people\
  \ who know how to use hashtags, people who own a Go-pro, people who don\u2019t have\
  \ a colony of head lice raving on their head.I am not cut out for this...\n\nAs\
  \ anxiety started to do its wonderful thing, the door opened and in walked Maya\
  \ and Eli, my two new housemates who I\u2019d barely spent time with. They immediately\
  \ saw I\u2019d been crying, I immediately became embarrassed. \n\n\nAn hour later,\
  \ or perhaps six vodkas later, we're perched on our balcony practicing saying of\
  \ \u2018Oh my God\u201D in Vietnamese with immense difficulty. The monsoon had subsided\
  \ and the sky is an inky twilight, streaks of pink stroke through, offering a promising\
  \ tomorrow. It turns out we all have lice. We possibly caught it from the the uber\
  \ bike helmets we wear each day. My brother called and he is sending a \u201Cnitty\
  \ gritty comb\u201D over through express delivery.\n\n We see so many Instagram\
  \ posts of people living their \u2018best lives\u2019 that we trick our minds, insult\
  \ our own intelligences into thinking those pictures are an accurate depiction of\
  \ life. But here on this balcony with adhesive shampoo in my hair, pyjamas on, stingy\
  \ eyes (from sobbing like a child) and cheap vodka in my hand, I feel happy.  I\u2019\
  m looking below at the streets; the cars, motorbikes and the people that braid so\
  \ casually as though it were a synchronised dance, I hear the ferocious beeping\
  \ of the vehicles intertwining with the Vietnamese language and I breathe in the\
  \ scent of the local cuisines; Pho, Bun Cha, Banh Mi which drifts invitingly through\
  \ the air. I\u2019m staying right here. There are most obstacles yet, but I\u2019\
  ve jumped my first hurdle. I am cut out for this. I just didn\u2019t expect to find\
  \ it through head lice."
