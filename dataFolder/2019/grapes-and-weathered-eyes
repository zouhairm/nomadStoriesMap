Text: "His weathered eyes brightened with familiarity as I stepped off the train,\
  \ but the university town was not our final destination. There was an hour long\
  \ drive through towns and grapes to reach our destination. \n\nParking behind the\
  \ one store in town we were greeted by shrieks of laughter. He was home. Myself,\
  \ a familiar stranger.\n\nThe little municipality of Burrweiler, Germany, too small\
  \ to even be called a town, seems to not have much to offer, but the streets have\
  \ a story. The families, here for generations. \n\nWalking through takes less than\
  \ 30 minutes, but it\u2019s full of greenery, fruit trees, and grapes. \nMany homes\
  \ have a few grape trees, others a yard full, and still others have acres. Burrweiler\
  \ is located in the second largest wine producing region in Germany, and a quiet\
  \ midway point for explorers. \n\nTime here was spent in the mountains the homes\
  \ backed up to. Driving the winding roads through the many different fields of grapes\
  \ towards Villa Ludwigsh\xF6ehe; pretending to be the King of Bavaria staying on\
  \ summer holiday, digging toes into riverbeds, taking lifts up the mountain to truly\
  \ see the beauty of the grapes. \n\nUp high there's rows and rows of grapes to see.\
  \ Between them all is collections of family homes. Those same weathered eyes informed\
  \ me that these homes are used less and less often, as children go away for school,\
  \ starting life in the big cities. When families are there they gather outside for\
  \ dinner every night. During those moments you see the draw of the place. It\u2019\
  s a piece of paradise; the lush ivory, trees, flowers, the beautiful mountains with\
  \ almost an exotic draw to the place.\n\nSitting at the dinner table on the last\
  \ night those same weathered eyes from before look at me with a spark of hope, but\
  \ also sadness. Will this be the one and only time I\u2019m here, or will meeting\
  \ this familiar stranger for the first time, walking the weathered streets, and\
  \ seeing the rich history be something that draws me back. It\u2019s a question\
  \ running through his mind used to history repeating itself. \n\nWondering if he\
  \ will continue to watch my life unfold from afar, a niece he will only meet once,\
  \ or one that's drawn back to nurture a relationship born among the grapes."
