Text: "We were about to clink our champagne flutes in celebration of our wedding anniversary\
  \ when our mobile phones began insistently buzzing against the bar counter. We were\
  \ both recipients of a WhatsApp group message: it was a video showing men in military\
  \ uniforms atop tanks rolling onto the Bosphorus Bridge. My brain was a whirring\
  \ jumble of thoughts. Samir\u2019s furrowed brows and puckered lips mirrored my\
  \ feelings. As if to dissipate the fog clouding our minds, we both received another\
  \ video on our phones. A soldier was ordering civilians to go home and stay indoors\
  \ as a curfew had been imposed. I caught the word \u201Ccoup\u201D from his message.\
  \ My nerves stretched tighter than a violin string. I froze. I had no ideas bouncing\
  \ through my head. \n\nThere were louder conversations and stiffer movements in\
  \ the crowd around us. I felt a jolt as my quick-thinking husband grabbed my wrist\
  \ and scurried out of the club to hail a taxi. While we were driven in direction\
  \ of Be\u015Fikta\u015F where our hotel was located, unconfirmed reports found their\
  \ way into our phones and the car radio. Secularist soldiers attempting to overthrow\
  \ Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011Fan had taken control of the Bosphorus\
  \ Bridge and shut off the connection between Turkey's Asian and European shores.\
  \ Heavily armed patrols had invaded the streets of Istanbul. The army had seized\
  \ the cable news channel CNN Turk and the live feed of the station was a blank studio.\
  \ I checked Twitter and Facebook for updates on my phone but they were blocked.\
  \ \u201COpen VPN, stay connected,\u201D Samir instructed. More news came in. Turkish\
  \ National Television TRT had also been taken over by the army. The news anchor\
  \ read their manifesto: \u201CTurkish Armed Forces have completely taken over the\
  \ administration of the country to reinstate constitutional order, human rights\
  \ and freedom.\u201D \n\nAs we neared Beyo\u011Flu, the traffic was bumper-to-bumper.\
  \ From the car radio, we heard President Erdo\u011Fan urging the public to take\
  \ to the streets. We only managed to drive up to Taksim square before we were caught\
  \ in a gridlock. Civilian patrols were marching down the road, brandishing Turkish\
  \ flags and chanting anti-coup slogans. The response was an immediate chatter of\
  \ machine gun fire. The road turned scarlet as blood flowed freely from one lifeless\
  \ body to the next. Then, a deafening sound, like the boom of thunder, came racing\
  \ across the land. Samir hunched over me in the backseat, forcing my head down as\
  \ the car windows and windshield shattered, sending splinters everywhere. It was\
  \ a low-flying fighter jet, showering the ground with bullets in an attempt to dissipate\
  \ the revolting crowd. We scrambled out of the car and tried to scuttle to a nearby\
  \ building when a blood-curdling roar turned my bones to jelly. We stopped dead\
  \ in our tracks and cowered behind the car instead. In an instant, there was a blinding\
  \ flash and a varicolored fire belched upward, leaving a series of smoke rings to\
  \ float slowly after it. The fireball flattened and spread to form the mushroom-head\
  \ of a column of incandescent gas, which mounted to overtake it. Thick black clouds\
  \ of smoke choked the air. A cacophony of shrill alarm bells ensued. Then came the\
  \ sirens of ambulances, police vehicles and fire engines shooting up the service\
  \ lane. \n\nBlinking salty sweat from my eyes, I turned to my side. All color drained\
  \ from my face. Samir was sprawled on the ground, his skin pale and clammy. With\
  \ a heaving lurch of his chest, a mouthful of blood dribbled from his quivering\
  \ lips. I let out a shriek so loud that everyone within a hundred-meter range came\
  \ running to help. A pair of strong hands pulled me into the glaring light of an\
  \ ambulance, while Samir\u2019s limp body was carried in onto a stretcher. With\
  \ every bump on the ride to the hospital, my fingernails dug deeper into my palms.\
  \ The sharp throbbing pain in my hands was no match for the searing pain in my heart.\
  \ The paramedics\u2019 reassuring words bounced right off me. I jerked as one of\
  \ the machines started beeping stridently. I placed Samir\u2019s frail hand in mine,\
  \ kissed his forehead and begged him to stay."
