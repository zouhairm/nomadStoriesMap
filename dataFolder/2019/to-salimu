Text: "My broken french took me to help in a school for french childrens where a non-french\
  \ little girl , a girl from Senegal, caught my attenion inmediatly she shined like\
  \ a full sun, Salimu. We connect inmediatly through our sarcastics jokes and our\
  \ bad taste in music, one morning she was looking down and she told me:- my father\
  \ fall in love one time with a woman, but it wasnt my mom- in that moment i look\
  \ at her with  waiting more details, she continues:- my father was a poor photographer\
  \ from Senegal when he was as tall as you Madame Ju, he travelled around Europe\
  \ taking pictures and falling in love strangers; in his first and only trip to Brugges\
  \ he found a woman and they fall so deeply in love that when they saw that they\
  \ couldnt be together anymore, he felt that apart  of him die that day and the only\
  \ thing that could making him a Little bit alive was alcohol and screaming at my\
  \ mom\n\nMy  young storyteller make a pause to took something out of her bag, she\
  \ passed me 3 black and white pictures that looked quite old, and continue to tell\
  \ me:- he die yesterday in Africa, she says:- he took this photographs in Belgium\
  \ the day that he meet this woman and  always had them with him, Madame Ju i know\
  \ that you are a traveller with kind eyes so i was thinking if you could go to this\
  \ places and see how they are and maybe recreate the pictures for me, that will\
  \ be kind.\n\nI answer with a quiet voice :- of course, but could you tell me why?\
  \ she reply : - well maybe, by seing this places again i can connect with my father,\
  \ maybe i can see who he was before becoming this sad and angry alcoholic , maybe\
  \ he was a funny person like me with dreams like me, during his love with this woman\
  \ maybe we were similars, i dont know ... if you do this Madame i Will give you\
  \ my lucky earing - while she said that she took one of her african earings and\
  \ put it in my ear as a payement for this misi\xF3n that she was giving me  and\
  \ i was accepting with full heart\n\nA couple of weeks passed ,i being travelling\
  \ with my backpack for a few countries by now and i finally arrived to this small\
  \ romantic village where this love story develloped so long ago. I was determided,\
  \ I asked the bartenders, the drunk people, the local people where i could find\
  \ this places? and their responses, after earing why i wanted to recreated them\
  \ ,  show so much hope that i could see from their eyes how everybody was falling\
  \ in love with my student and this journey like i did the first time .\n\nI finally\
  \ found the places during a sunset, the same church , the same moline and even the\
  \ same trees where waiting for Salimu, i cried for the first time in long time,\
  \ i felt every little conections that  allowed me, an Argentinian with a camera\
  \ to step the same steps where  love unfurled into the eternity dourty years ago\n\
  \nAlready in France, my heart was skippin beats in my way to the school, i couldnt\
  \ wait for the sun to rise so i can show Sali , how evertything has more color now\
  \ but still remind the same. I jumped in class and scanned the room for my storyteller\
  \ but i couldnt see her, usually i see her first,- Elle a retournee a son pays ,\
  \ my collegue said - she came back to her country, she and her family will stayed\
  \ there i am sorry i cannot give you more details but she is gone. \n\nI hold the\
  \ pictures close to my heart, and send a prayer to the wind that i still repeat\
  \ untill this day ; Dear Salimu, you are loved, I know, your father loved someone\
  \ and for that, love will run through your veins forever, you will love honestly\
  \ this time and love will go around the world to find you, we are made of our stories\
  \ you dont see Sali? You are made of sunsets."
