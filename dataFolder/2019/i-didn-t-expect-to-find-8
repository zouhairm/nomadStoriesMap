Text: I didn't expect to find                                                   My
  first time traveling experience from which I learn how to be an independent and
  free women. My first ever traveling journey of India. Being in an unknow country
  where you donot know anything about there culture and traditon only having a positive
  feeling that I know english language ( universal language of communication) .                            But
  this traveling has given me a courage confidence ability and determination that
  being a wonen . I can live my life what to give me motivation i can do it . I didnot
  except to find myself and my dream of seeing whole word with open eyes. While traveling
  in india , it was not a long trip but form me it was the most challenging and adventures
  trip. Where I face my obstacles how to go see taj mahal , india gate , kashmir ,
  Rajasthan and sikim. Then I taking aeroplane ,bus, train , taxi . I visited all
  this places alone with confidence in being a women who has big dream to achieve
  and connot look back but have to go ...                              I didnot expect
  to find my true self desire and wish in unknown country but i find that traveling
  alone teach you to be calm relax hear your inner voice give time to your self.
