Text: "The blistering air of Northern Territory\u2019s dry season whipped across my\
  \ freckled face as I shuffled through the red dusty plains of Arnhem Land, and towards\
  \ the Aboriginal man I could see carefully watching me. The sun had already started\
  \ its assault for a third day of extreme heat, and I could feel the sunburn from\
  \ the previous day starting to peel across my nose and gracelessly flake off my\
  \ shoulders. I pulled my cap further down over my face as if to shelter my skin\
  \ from any further damage, and continued forward.\n\n\u201CBrown snake or tree branch?\u201D\
  \ I repeated, over and over in my head. I was hyper-aware of my surroundings, my\
  \ eyes darting to every stick on the ground, afraid one of them could rear up and\
  \ bite me, paralysing me with venom. But as my mind began to muse over where the\
  \ nearest hospital would be, I was snapped out of my paranoia by a loud clatter.\
  \ \n\nThe Aboriginal man was squatting on the ground twenty metres ahead, surrounded\
  \ by palettes of earth coloured paints and tiny brushes which had all fallen around\
  \ him. I cautiously approached and began to help him pick everything up. The brushes\
  \ looked as though they were hundreds of years old, with patches of dried paint\
  \ pressed into the handles, and the paint itself now filled with little red grains\
  \ of the earth it had fallen on. \n\nThe man\u2019s hands, also covered in dried\
  \ paint, opened out to me. Sensing that I was welcome, I lingered by his side. \n\
  \nAs I sat down he gave me a big, warm smile, causing all the wrinkles to congregate\
  \ in the centre of his face, before he picked up a large wooden cylinder and continued\
  \ to paint it with miniature dots and lines. I recognised this cylinder, it was\
  \ a didgeridoo; an Indigenous Australian wind instrument I had only ever learnt\
  \ about in my primary school classroom back home. \n\nI was perplexed by what he\
  \ was painting onto it, he held the brushes as if they were his own limbs, gracefully\
  \ alternating between an assortment of shades and dabbing them against the wood.\
  \ I must have been evidently puzzled, as he stopped his work to gently take my hand\
  \ and guide it across the top of the didgeridoo, scathing the sides of the rough\
  \ surface and pointing out different symbols to show me what they meant. \n\nI watched\
  \ intently as he traced my fingers over the paintings, maps were coming to life\
  \ in front of my eyes and I could see stretches of land, people, and animals all\
  \ disguised within. The simple dots and lines I originally saw were intricately\
  \ woven together to illustrate the chronicle of this man\u2019s home and its people.\n\
  \nHere, five hundred kilometres from the nearest city, Arnhem Land lay, home to\
  \ the oldest living culture in the world and preserved by its people through stories\
  \ and paintings just like this one. I embraced the man\u2019s hands in mine with\
  \ immense gratitude, how good it felt to be so connected with another human being\
  \ without saying a word.\n\nI stood up and moved away from him, kicking up the terrain\
  \ between my bare toes as I went, a distinct Australian layer of red dust settling\
  \ over my feet and all the way up my legs. As I lumbered through the oppressive\
  \ heat, I noticed there was a group of children sitting nearby in a close-knit circle.\
  \ \n\nEach of them had didgeridoos and tiny brushes of their own, they were laughing\
  \ and painting, sitting cross legged and sharing palettes of paint in the centre\
  \ of the circle. I looked out at the never-ending landscapes around me and smiled\
  \ to myself as I thought of the stories those children would all grow to tell, and\
  \ of the next stranger who is lucky enough to come along and share it with them."
