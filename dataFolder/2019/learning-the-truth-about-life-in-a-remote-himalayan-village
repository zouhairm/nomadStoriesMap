Text: "For the longest of time, I was an armchair traveler mostly because I was perpetually\
  \ broke, and because I was a high school girl with- let\u2019s say- not very liberal\
  \ parents. I would scroll through Instagram and laud at the courage of the countless\
  \ solo women travelers I saw posing at exotic locations and wish to be like them\
  \ someday. The most I had ever travelled was either with my family on short, luxurious\
  \ vacations, or on school trips to nearby places. Amidst countless jeep safaris\
  \ and swimming in fancy resort pools, I realized this is not the kind of travelling\
  \ I wish to do. Come first year of college and I was already saving up to get out\
  \ there, ready to take on the small hamlets set deep within the Himalayas, hike\
  \ up a mountain or two, and be at par with these women I saw on Instagram.\n\nI\
  \ bought a new rucksack, a tent, a sleeping bag, some hiking gear and before I knew\
  \ it, I was sitting in an overnight bus taking me to Dharamshala, home of the Dalai\
  \ Lama. My heart was racing and my palms were clammy but with an excited grin on\
  \ my face, I was telling the French man sitting beside me how I was ready to be\
  \ a solo traveler in a country where women still do not enjoy the same rights as\
  \ men do. I told him how I would come back home having accomplished so much, ready\
  \ to boast about it on social media for the world to see. All he gave me was a small\
  \ wise smile without saying much and went off to sleep.\n\nThe next morning I found\
  \ myself in Kareri, a small village 30 kilometers from Dharamshala, but my welcome\
  \ didn\u2019t go exactly as I had hoped. The rain gods seemed to be taking it all\
  \ out on my elaborate plans of hiking in the mountains and so I had to spend the\
  \ next couple of days in a small homestay I had managed to find in the pouring rain.\
  \ I was pampered by Hanraj bhai and his wife Sushma ji with hearty meals and spent\
  \ the mostly rainy days with their little kids of seven and three playing ludo,\
  \ or being subjected to their latest love of playing doctor-doctor.\n\nOn some days,\
  \ the sun would come out with a rainbow or two, only to be clouded with massive\
  \ grey fluffs the next moment. Before I knew it, a week had already passed for me\
  \ in Kareri but the incessant rains hadn\u2019t stopped. The kutcha roads leading\
  \ from Dharamshala to Kareri had turned into slush, so there was no going back.\
  \ But life must go on. Pretty soon, I was dropping off little Nidhi to her tuition\
  \ classes, or walking down to the village market to fetch some groceries for my\
  \ host family. On manageable days, we would go to their wheat farms and tend to\
  \ the crops, or go to their stable to check up on the horses. During dinner, I would\
  \ help Sushma ji in the kitchen, and later would discuss politics with Hansraj ji\
  \ over a cup of chai before going back to bed.\n\nTo this day I cannot comprehend\
  \ how those two weeks went by. The rains eventually stopped but my plans of hiking\
  \ in the Himalayas gave way to wanting to learn the harsh life in the Himalayan\
  \ villages. I learnt how one had to visit the neighbouring village eight kilometers\
  \ away in search of a chemist, petrol pump, doctor or a barber shop. The nearest\
  \ ATM was in Dharamshala and the school in Kareri was only up till the eighth grade.\
  \ The roads would get blocked during heavy rain or snow, leaving the villagers stranded\
  \ with whatever little they had. Each house had a large storage room stocked with\
  \ rice, pulses, oil and whatever else one might need in times of emergencies. How\
  \ long would these emergencies last, no one knew. True, I couldn\u2019t conquer\
  \ the Himalayas as a solo woman traveler and gloat about it on social media, but\
  \ I ended up bursting my little city girl bubble and learning the truth about life\
  \ instead."
