Text: "Giovanni, my unofficial tour guide, walked quickly in front of me. \u201CYour\
  \ first lesson in Italy, how to cross the street\u201D.  Giovanni paused at the\
  \ edge of the avenue. Giovanni was very sure of himself,  wearing solid black suit\
  \ and Dolce and Gabbana belt, he walked with pure confidence.\n\nThis road was not\
  \ an ordinary road in Rome. It was the as wide as the Atlantic Ocean.  Wind whipped\
  \ my face as the cars raced by. I estimated in my head their speed. \n\n\u201CCome\u201D\
  \ he coached me. \nGiovanni stepped into the lane. Horns honked. Cars swerved. Drivers\
  \ cursed.  I bit my lip.\n\u201CWhat is the speed limit here?\u201D \n\n There must\
  \ be another way I thought to myself. I dragged my finger along the route  on the\
  \ map.  Via Degli Scipioni wrapped itself around the perimeter of the Vatican like\
  \ a python, hugging it\u2019s new victim.  \n\n\u201DHere there is no such thing\
  \ as \u201Cwalk\u201D or \u201Cdo not walk\u201D There is only  \u201Cgo\u201D.\u201D\
  \  \nEvery word he spoke he had a coordinated hand gesture. He brought his index\
  \ finger and thumb together, \"Go now.\" Italians need their hands to speak. He\
  \ bounced his hand after every word for emphasis. \n\n\u201CItalians have no speed\
  \ limits. No stop signs. No traffic police. Here, you must just go.\u201D \nHe grabbed\
  \ my elbow and began to drag me. \n\u201CFirst, look that the driver in the eyes.\
  \  Then go. Just go\u201D.\n\nCitrus trees lined the streets. Lemon and oranges\
  \ added vibrant color to the landscape. But just as he was talking, an orange rolled\
  \ into the traffic. It was instantaneously crushed.  The scent of  bloody citrus\
  \ guts soaked the air. \n\u201CNo.\u201D I pulled back.\nGiovanni shook his head\
  \ in disappointment. He sighed and stepped back onto the sidewalk.\n\u201C In America,\
  \ you go... then the car goes a little... then you stop a little\u2026. and then\
  \ you go. But \n If you do that here someone will hit you.\u201D\n I  was paralysed.\
  \ I was Michangelo's chiseled marble.\n \u201COkay.\u201D Giovanni said, \u201C\
  stay here forever.\u201D\n\nThe sun was starting to set. I blinked, resting my eyes\
  \ for an exaggerated second. There was no other way.  I took a deep breath and stepped\
  \ into the street.   I connected my eyes with the driver of the approaching car.\
  \ Focused on her until I made it to the other side. \n\nAnd if there is anything\
  \ that I have taken from my experience here in Rome it is how to stare at drivers\
  \ while walking into their lane of traffic."
