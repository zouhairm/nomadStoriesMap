Text: "We enter Madrid\u2019s Plaza Mayor from the south. People are starting to gather.\
  \ We find a circular bench around a lamppost and stake out our spot. My husband\
  \ is tall and can see over the crowd, but I am not, and my children are very small.\
  \ My fat 6-month-old son bobs his head around in the baby carrier on his dad\u2019\
  s chest, looking at everything and taking it in. We can see the metal barriers set\
  \ up in a rectangle where the drummers are to assemble. \nIt\u2019s Easter Sunday\
  \ in Madrid, and the public displays and parades are wonderful. Our Canadian sensibilities\
  \ have been shaken as we watched this city celebrate Holy Week without a fluffy\
  \ bunny in sight. Holy Week culminates in this celebration of drums. As I walk a\
  \ short distance from the bench, I look at all the windows lining the Plaza Mayor.\
  \ My 2-and-a-half-year-old daughter, Nora, stands back as she watches a street performer\
  \ make giant bubbles. She\u2019s interested, but shy. I watch people mill about,\
  \ idly thinking that this would be a captive group of people for a bomb blast or\
  \ terrorist attack. Nothing happens of course, and I bring my toddler back to our\
  \ spot as the plaza gets more crowded. \nOur space on the bench shrinks, and I balance\
  \ my daughter\u2019s feet on the back of the bench near the lamppost, my arm keeping\
  \ her from falling. We hear the drummers before they file in. Nora points at things\
  \ and chatters, asking questions and making observations. An older woman stands\
  \ in front of us and my toddler chats to her. The woman shakes her head. She doesn\u2019\
  t speak English. We don\u2019t speak Spanish. My daughter is undeterred and continues\
  \ chatting her ear off. The woman speaks to her in Spanish and Nora carries on in\
  \ English. Soon enough, my friendly little girl has climbed into the arms of this\
  \ stranger and is happily making a new friend. She shakes her head of blonde corkscrew\
  \ curls and points this way and that. She is rewarded with smiles and responses\
  \ in Spanish from her temporary grandma.\nI watch my trusting and friendly child\
  \ bridge barriers of language, age, and culture as she converses and watches the\
  \ crowd from the arms of a stranger. This is why we travel with our small children.\
  \ Nora will not keep this as a conscious memory, but it will be part of her formative\
  \ experience as she learns to view the world and its people, and find her place\
  \ in it."
