Text: "And all of a sudden, the fun became serious\u2026\nIt was in March 2017 when\
  \ I was on a spontaneous trip in Mexico with two friends from Germany. Nothing was\
  \ planned, we did not have much money, neither much knowledge about the country.\
  \ One day, we were already travelling together with some other backpackers from\
  \ Canada and the States, we decided to camp at a huge parking at a supermarket in\
  \ Tulum. Till then, we have not really been in touch with locals but this day a\
  \ young Mayan guy, he was about our age, about twenty years old, who lived close\
  \ by, came up to us to hang out and we became friends. He told us about his culture\
  \ and a few days later he invited us to his family\u2019s house in a small Mayan\
  \ village a few hours away. It was an honor for us and we were very excited to see\
  \ how the locals live. When we arrived at his parent\u2019s place we were welcomed\
  \ by the whole family with so much love. They cooked dinner for us and the next\
  \ day our new friend and his younger brother wanted to show us an old ruin in the\
  \ middle of the jungle, which is a sacred place for the Mayan people. It was an\
  \ amazing experience walking through this untouched nature with a native showing\
  \ us his culture and way of living. It was incredible to see this ancient ruin,\
  \ far away from all the tourist spots, but then we got in trouble. On our way back\
  \ to the street we were stopped by some other natives who said we were not allowed\
  \ to be here since we are not locals. They told us we have to pay them a fine and\
  \ tried to scare us with machetes in their hands. My Spanish was bad, so I did not\
  \ really know what was going on. We did not know what to do, had no money to pay\
  \ anyways and just did not want to cause troubles. I don\u2019t know what they were\
  \ talking about but all of a sudden, they took our friend in their car and drove\
  \ off. We were shocked. His little brother was still with us but nobody thought\
  \ about asking him for advice because he was too young. What the others did not\
  \ realize, this young kid grew up in a different environment than we did. He was\
  \ young but wise and once we got him involved, he could help us to save his brother.\
  \ A car came by and stopped, it was their uncle. We explained the situation and\
  \ he knew this is serious and we had to react quickly. The uncle knew these people\
  \ just wanted to rip us of and for sure did not take his nephew to police. Two of\
  \ our group jumped into the car and tried to find our friend. We were waiting for\
  \ several hours, hours of uncertainty. It seemed like a movie but this was reality.\
  \ And then finally the car came back. They found him and told us that he was really\
  \ in danger. They threatened him but the uncle and our friends came in time to rescue\
  \ him. We could breathe a sigh of relief but still it took us quite some time to\
  \ handle this incidence. We wanted to get to know the authentic Mexican life and\
  \ we did, with all it\u2019s good and bad sides and the most important thing is,\
  \ we all still love traveling, we respect locals and their lives and this story,\
  \ with all its positive and negative aspects, let ourselves grow so much!"
