Text: "Travelling the world is something everybody wants to do these days. Just like\
  \ them, I decided to travel all by myself to Melbourne. I knew nobody here. It was\
  \ crazy. 10 days into this beautiful city, I found a job. I thought this job can\
  \ finance all my upcoming travel stories. Unfortunately, my family also wanted me\
  \ to study. I got so stuck with my life at University that I completely forgot the\
  \ first love of my life which is writing poems. After few days of being upset, I\
  \ decided to write about the little things that I was surrounded by every day. I\
  \ started writing about my love for this new city, cultures and also made a poem\
  \ about how my dad kept asking me to forget writing and concentrate on my studies.\
  \ I just started finding happiness in little things and I realised that life is\
  \ much better this way. Melbourne helped me go back to my first love- Writing. At\
  \ least now I did not have any judgemental eyes on me when I wrote poems or stories.\
  \ Though the freedom helped me a lot to go back to my passion, being independent\
  \ is not easy. The fairy tale story took a turn and I ended up alone in the most\
  \ liveable city in the world. Little did I know that a broken heart helps to write\
  \ even more meaningful stories and poems. Things kept coming at me but I kept using\
  \ them for my betterment instead of my downfall. Walking around the cosy but busy\
  \ streets of Melbourne taught me how I was not the only person who had problems.\
  \ Melbourne did not help me find myself completely but it definitely got me closer.\
  \ There is a lot more to explore about my personality. With every city I travel\
  \ to, I want to know something new about myself. I do not want to stop this process\
  \ of surprising myself. Travelling alone does make you independent but it also changes\
  \ you from within. It gives you a different perspective about you as well as others.\
  \ After a few days of exploring the city and working at my new job, I told my father\
  \ that living in a different city alone gives you the same amount of knowledge as\
  \ an university. In fact this kind of knowledge is practical. I hope I never stop\
  \ travelling. I am and will always be a nomad at heart. It is my wish to travel\
  \ to one more country before 2019 ends. I do not want to conclude my story because\
  \ it\u2019s not the end.. the movie is yet to finish. It\u2019s definitely not the\
  \ end until it\u2019s happy."
