Text: "And Nigeria is indeed, Africa in miniature.  In August 2017, I decided to take\
  \ on a trip to the \"lion of Africa \" as many refer to this country.  I had read\
  \ and heard much about Nigeria before but I never thought it was this true. \n \
  \     When I arrived the capital, Abuja,  I almost thought our flight lost it's\
  \ way. Unlike some it he'd African countries,  the capital city lagos is highly\
  \ developed and almost to European standards.  There in lagos, there was much to\
  \ do. I mean site seeing, eating,  playing and much more.  I had booked for a hotel\
  \ room before my arrival.  So I spent the nights in my hotel room and during the\
  \ day, I went down the streets to experience life in Nigeria.  The streets were\
  \ always busy. Hawkers, petty traders, motorcycle riders and vehicles.  I boarded\
  \ a tricycle, commonly known as \"keke\" for the first time in my entire life. \
  \ This tricycle is designed for three persons i.e the rider and two passengers and\
  \ it is way faster and even cheaper than a taxi. With this, I could tour a wide\
  \ area in just few hours.  Local cuisines also caught my attention.  I had a taste\
  \ of delicious Nigerian meals like \"eba\" .  This is a melange of cassava flour\
  \ and soup, a local told me.  Though Nigeria is one of the counties with a wide\
  \ gap between the rich and the poor,  this country is a culturally gifted.  I spent\
  \ some of my evenings at the cinema watching auditions and life broadcast from comedians.\
  \  It was fun indeed. \n    The Nigerian film industry,  Nollywood is a key entertainment\
  \ industry in Nigeria.  They produce varieties of movies which suit your taste.\
  \  The Nigerian police though crazy in their own kind of way are sometimes friendly\
  \ and helpful to strangers. \n        Nigerians are very enterprising and talented.\
  \  Full of creativity.  Music shows also attracted me.  This country is one of the\
  \ cheapest countries to visit. With just 100 naira, I could eat in a restaurant\
  \ and I'm fully satisfied.  This may sound strange but of course it's true. \n \
  \       My stay in Nigeria finally ended and I felt sad leaving.  How I wished I\
  \ could extend it just so I could experience more realities about Nigeria. In fact,\
  \  I never expected to find this country so interesting."
