Text: "On my very first morning, first day in India, a full-on immersion into the\
  \ Mumbai railway system welcomed me. Here is where the real action is. There is\
  \ something about the Mumbai train that screams life. There is that feeling, while\
  \ not always comfortable, of being alive and being part of something. And finding\
  \ myself in a crowd, pushing and getting pushed, I became the crowd. I had never\
  \ felt so human, so not a stranger. I then entered a fishing village in Uttan and\
  \ saw men preparing milk and women flipping chapattis, and took in the mix of spices\
  \ and the scents of the street, all in just one day. Yes, as I tried to bobble the\
  \ Indian way, a newfound friend told me what I saw was just a small part of Mumbai\
  \ though. \n\nThe morning after I woke up to the chatter of women in the kitchen,\
  \ and I offered to help. I had to put aside my slippers before I took my spot in\
  \ the circle of mothers sitting on mats in various stages of cooking preparations.\
  \ I was tasked to slice onions after onions right at the very beginning of the assembly\
  \ line. I was also introduced to two types of rice, three types of masala, and two\
  \ important words: let\u2019s go and thank you -- chalo and danyawad -- that I tried\
  \ to dabble in pronouncing correctly in between bouts of pending tears and a runny\
  \ nose. \n\nThe day arrived when I came down with diarrhea and fever, not an unusual\
  \ initiation rite I had been warned. I also got an Indian shirt as an official welcome\
  \ gift. Perhaps, with a bit of time, everything shall too be second skin, I told\
  \ myself. By Bandstand in Bandra, between the fortress and the bridge, on my last\
  \ day in Mumbai I tried to mark my territory by getting down to the rock formations\
  \ to touch the water. And a wave came to kiss me on the face and wet my shoes. I\
  \ then wondered how Bangalore would be like as I looked at the Arabian Sea for one\
  \ last time before heading deeper south of the subcontinent.\n\nAside from the cool\
  \ weather and a more laidback atmosphere, Bangalore was not much different with\
  \ its streets randomly matrixed with peddlers in carts and cycles. Just outside\
  \ of the house where I was staying, two men under a makeshift tent were ironing\
  \ clothes for a living using a pair of traditional iron. While the city is landlocked,\
  \ it is in the heart of South India, from where you can reach the country\u2019\
  s many other interesting regions like Kerala, in the west, where every house visit\
  \ would mean taking your footwear off time and again and entering into a simple,\
  \ well-knit family life that seemed to have been all lost in many parts of the world.\
  \ \n\nA trip to the Srirangam temple in Trichy in the eastern part proved to be\
  \ one to have left an imprint on me as a traveler. Considered as the largest functioning\
  \ Hindu temple in the world, not only did its vast expanse require guests to commune\
  \ with the ground without protection, its sheer size and beauty was really humbling.\
  \ Our guide asked us to leave our footwear in the bus, which also meant walking\
  \ barefoot already through a portion of the city and a market area before arriving\
  \ at the first entrance of the complex. That was when I really felt that I had touched\
  \ base with something that is within me, that desire to connect with something real\
  \ and concrete. \n\nWhile I initially cringed at the idea of walking inside homes\
  \ and temples barefoot, I understood it is a necessary step to make peace with the\
  \ truth. I felt that India is not only about marveling at the great beauty of its\
  \ people and the complexities of its culture. But also, it is the act of embracing\
  \ what is different, what makes you uncomfortable. I kept telling myself, home is\
  \ a journey. And that I should be ready to walk, even barefoot."
