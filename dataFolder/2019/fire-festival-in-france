Text: "I\u2019m headed south, leaving Paris behind me. The fields of many colors sprawling\
  \ beyond the train window warm and excite me. Lavender. Sunflower. Olive. Patches\
  \ of land making up the quilt that is the French countryside. \n\nMy friend meets\
  \ me at the train station in Marseilles. Eva and I haven\u2019t seen each other\
  \ in 10 years. We were two young girls in Texas, born to different countries, jumping\
  \ on the same trampoline. \n\nShe drives us 60 kilometers north towards her family\u2019\
  s farmstead in Saint Est\xE8ve-Janson. I keep referring to where we are going as\
  \ \u201Cher town,\u201D and eventually, Eva corrects me. She lives in what is considered\
  \ a commune. I envision un-showered hippies grinning with blank faces, planting\
  \ flowers and hugging trees. Then, she points out their Town Hall. It seems commune\
  \ is simply a word for a small territory in France with a sparse population; a community.\n\
  \nI\u2019m welcomed to the farm by Eva\u2019s parents, grandparents, aunt, uncle,\
  \ and younger sister, Jade. The sun sets on the hilly landscape as they show me\
  \ goats, chickens and cows which are, to everyone\u2019s surprise, a rare sight\
  \ to this Texan native. I ask about the half-built structure set apart from the\
  \ main house, close to the road, and learn that they are building a family-run restaurant.\
  \ They all build, cook, and clean each day to get it up and running. I offer to\
  \ help during my stay.\n\nThis first night of my visit happens to be la F\xEAte\
  \ de la Sainte-Jean, or Saint John\u2019s Eve. It\u2019s a bonfire party thrown\
  \ the evening before the annual Feast Day honoring John the Baptist, Eva explains.\
  \ So after we dine on the most organic meal I\u2019ve ever had, we pile into the\
  \ minivan and drive a few miles down a dirt road until we see a bright orange burning\
  \ mass. I had pictured a small campfire for roasting marshmallows, but this is an\
  \ inferno towering high above a crowd of people. \n\nWe park and walk towards the\
  \ festivities. Jade runs off to join a group of girls her own age. The rest of us\
  \ find a picnic table, where we open up a bottle of ros\xE9 and observe. The music\
  \ ceases to become background noise. Wait.... is this Madonna? I turn to see to\
  \ two massive speakers connected to a stereo system sans DJ. I cannot wait to hear\
  \ what\u2019s next on the playlist.\n\nA familiar guitar riff plays out. Eva jumps\
  \ off the bench and pulls me with her, closer to the fire. She turns to me belting\
  \ out, \u201CI'm on the highway to hell!\u201D I look around and everyone is singing\
  \ the AC/DC anthem. One hundred Proven\xE7als rocking out. The energy is infectious\
  \ and I give in to the revelry. \n\nNext up: Cotton-eyed Joe. We line dance, link\
  \ arms, twirl and skip around the fire. A wild night in the south of France.\n\n\
  In the morning, I awake to \u201Ccock-a-doodle do!\u201D Never in my life have I\
  \ heard a real rooster crowing at the break of dawn. It was motion-picture-perfect.\
  \ I hear a knock on the door, and Eva and Jade peek in to ask, \u201CReady to start\
  \ working?\u201D The family and I make our way outside after breakfast. The June\
  \ sun rises overhead, just as the flames did the night before."
