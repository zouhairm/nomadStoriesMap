Text: "6 am I wave goodbye to my boyfriend at London Paddington station. 9 hours pass\
  \ I land in Mumbai, India. What the hell am I doing. Panic and inadequate thermoregulation\
  \ set in. I continue to put one foot in front of the other. In the queue to check\
  \ in my luggage those around me are in disarray. Order is not commonplace here.\
  \ I start thinking about the lighter in my luggage. Why did I pack a lighter? I\
  \ don't smoke, I'm sure a travel blog had said there was a useful reason for taking\
  \ a lighter, I sifted through all the emotions in my brain scrambling for the reason\
  \ to justify taking a potentially illegal piece of luggage in the bowels of my bag\
  \ to the rapidly approaching security clerk. 3 hours later I step off the plane\
  \ in Chennai. 2 steps out of the modern airport the coarse, dry heat of the city\
  \ hits me like a brick wall. Exhausted, my patience is wearing thin as my lift arrives\
  \ 2 hours late. \n\nThe colours of the streets felt like a dream. I didn't have\
  \ the energy to comprehend the bustle of the streets, was that a cow? The noise\
  \ was constant, horns, screams, chants, the sizzle of street vendors. I wasn't cut\
  \ out for this. 3 months of this what was I thinking, no amount of preparation would\
  \ have been enough. \n\n24 hours later the dust had metaphorically settled as I\
  \ sat in a room with 40 other young people. 4 small air conditioning units burred\
  \ as whispers bounced off the coarse walls. 'welcome' a loud voice bellowed. The\
  \ start of the most difficult journey of my life had begun. \n\nVolunteering remains\
  \ to me a daunting experience, even after participating as a volunteer for over\
  \ 12 years, but my three month stint volunteering for a youth empowerment agency\
  \ in rural India really took the Nankhatai. Despite several pre-departure training\
  \ days and a week in country orientation I remained powerless to the emotion evoked\
  \ by India. I embarked on my project nestled between two team members in the backseat\
  \ of a very stuffy mini-bus. Opening the window worsened the situation, I closed\
  \ my eyes fondly reminiscing about the cold fresh Scottish air from which I had\
  \ come several days previously. My false sense of calm came to an abrupt end as\
  \ the bus hit a bump in the road and my very vegan team member screamed out in despair.\
  \ Not wanting to know what me had just hit my face fell to my hands and for the\
  \ 1000th time since leaving the UK I questioned my decision to embark on this 'experience'.\
  \ \n\nThis was life for the young Indian people I spent the next three months working\
  \ with. I was able to experience their lives first hand at and in between breakfast\
  \ lunch and dinner. We became a tight nit group, we had no choice. Sleeping less\
  \ than a meter from one another I used to dream about the individuals I spent 12\
  \ hours a day working and talking with. Did we make a difference, I'd like to hope\
  \ so. But fact of the matter is that India definitely had more of an impact on me\
  \ than I did on it. \n\nEmbarking on a project immersing yourself in a small community\
  \ you set yourself up to be changed. My eyes were open to colour, kindness, sweltering\
  \ heat (both from the sun and the chili) and a multitude of life altering experiences.\
  \ I had no idea what would come from this experience and my overwhelming feeling\
  \ on reflection is resilience. The people I engaged with each day were resilient.\
  \ Some of them lived in little more than mud huts, yet they were happier than 90%\
  \ of my peers in the UK. A group of naive young people, myself included, were not\
  \ going to 'help' this community, but we could learn from each other, challenge\
  \ each others attitudes and opinions, question actions and find common ground. \n\
  \nAt the end of the day, host family, fellow volunteers army of mosquitoes, I hope\
  \ I had half the impact on your life as you had on mine."
