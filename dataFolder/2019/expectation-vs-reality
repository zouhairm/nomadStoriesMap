Text: "Sometimes when you travel things are not what you expected them to be, you\
  \ know? Maybe you wanted to go to some place your entire life and when you get there\
  \ it isn't what you thought it would be or you don\u2019t feel the way you thought\
  \ you would feel. For me, that was Machu Picchu. I loved it, don\u2019t get me wrong...but\
  \ sometimes people ruin things. \nI travelled there during the low season, kind\
  \ of hoping there would be a manageable amount of people, silly me!I was overwhelmed\
  \ by the crowds and the level of anxiety So, while I was waiting to get in, I took\
  \ a deep breath and reminded myself that since, I was by myself without a tour group,\
  \ I was going to be able to skip the crowds and do things at my own pace.\nOnce\
  \ I got inside the park I realized that there is only one trail for everyone. And,\
  \ of course, there were bottlenecks. Imagine the highway at the rush hour, exactly\
  \ that. So there I was, with my camera, at the place where you can take the classic\
  \ picture of the citadel with the mountains, trying to find the best angle. But\
  \ before I could get my shot someone got in the way. So I moved and it happened\
  \ again, so I moved again. Every single time. In the end I lost my patience and\
  \ gave upon the shot.\nI a really bad mood at this point, I decided to try to find\
  \ a not so crowded trail that another traveler had recommended, the Inca Bridge\
  \ trail. So peaceful! I was so fed up of people\u2019s behaviour that hearing the\
  \ river and the birds, was just what I needed. When I felt better, I had the strength\
  \ to walk around the citadel, sit in the terraces where the incas used to plant,\
  \ and enjoy the beautiful mountains view. \nI stayed in Machu Picchu from the early\
  \ morning until closing time, but to be honest, all the way back to Cusco I couldn\u2019\
  t stop feeling disappointed. I was expecting lots people, but I wasn\u2019t expecting\
  \ that kind energy. People running late to \u201Csee\u201D the place through their\
  \ phones or cameras and not caring about the other people around. I know that I\
  \ shouldn\u2019t let things like this ruin a breathtaking place full of history\
  \ and nature, but, people are a part of how we experience things."
