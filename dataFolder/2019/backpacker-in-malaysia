Text: "hello, i am a Solo Traveller, i usually going somewhere by myself. i tried\
  \ to ask my friend to join in my random trip to a new places, but sometimes they\
  \ just too busy, run out money or just lazy to move their ass. \n\nThis time will\
  \ share my story to travel first time to Malaysia, before i ever been visit Singapore\
  \ alone too. a random life, but i am happy cause i will know a wat to go there by\
  \ myself, not complain to have a good time too. \n\nI am going to Malaysia by myself\
  \ to join a promo ticket for sure but poorly i came late because of i have meeting\
  \ in that day. i just confused how to spend my end year holiday. then i back home\
  \ to think it better and i decide to buy a new ticket for me and i back to the airport.\
  \ \n\ni use ticket to Singapore and going to Malaysia by bus. so amazing time, because\
  \ of i never going there by bus transfer to the long line of immigration waiting\
  \ list from Singapore to Malaysia, going to nearest bus terminal to reach Malaysia.\n\
  \nMalaysia not so different like Indonesia, but this time better, in the waiting\
  \ room, but for the calling system is still need prepared well. the bus already\
  \ waiting me in the line of bus stop. same like Indonesia. i walk to the bus, but\
  \ this time is little bit confuse about which bus i need to get in, in the ticket\
  \ a name of a bus not printed in the body of the bus. no detail information just\
  \ follow the instruction from the waiting list and asking the driver is it a bus\
  \ to Kuala Lumpur? totally same like my hometown. \n\nThis is my first time to visit\
  \ here with this conditions, beside the driver when i asked to use toilet while\
  \ he fill the fuel little bit angry and shouted. but i promised to use toilet only\
  \ for a few minute. and i alhamdulillah the toilet no line to wait and i can back\
  \ to the bus before the fuel is full. \n\nand we go to Kuala Lumpur maybe around\
  \ 6 hour and i arrived in the other of big bus terminal, i forgot the name. and\
  \ i go by Grab and going to my Hotel. 2 am i arrive my Hotel and clean up then sleep.\
  \ \n\nDay 2 i n the morning i prepared to going to Batu Caves in the early morning\
  \ 8 am. i already arrived and walking around the Batu Caves, took a picture and\
  \ going back to KL sentral by Train. \n\nbefore i planed to go to Genting highland\
  \ but the Bus from KL Sentral just run out and i decide to travel around KL. i visit\
  \ Brickfield and taste a drink and food there. a small area in brickfield but a\
  \ good taste of Food and Drink. as a cosmopolitan person, there is no AC and walking\
  \ to brickfield from KL Sentral just little bit hot in the 12 pm when the sun just\
  \ so excited to show his light. better when u want to go there, u can use a bus\
  \ only 1 Ringgit to go there and only a short way maybe 1 km from KL Sentral. \n\
  \nAfter Finish there, i am going to Masjid Jamek, Petronas Tower take a picture.\
  \ in the night i am walking around Chinatown and Central Market. \nDay 3, i just\
  \ preparing for going back to my country.\n\nif In the KL u can use train, but for\
  \ traveller, better u buy a card for all passes all train, because no need to buy\
  \ a ticket again and again to come and in. for going to airport u can use the passes\
  \ by  1 or 2 side. the prices just little bit different. For me Singapore still\
  \ a good places to go, neither a price is little bit pricy then Malaysia. but Malaysia\
  \ has a much mosque and i can pray easily."
