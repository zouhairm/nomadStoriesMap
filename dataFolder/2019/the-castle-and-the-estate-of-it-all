Text: "\u201CWell, Scotland doesn\u2019t really have trespassing laws,\u201D was as\
  \ much reassurance as I was going to get, crossing the rotting fence with the NO\
  \ ENTRY sign stapled to it. I wouldn\u2019t need much reassurance once I passed\
  \ the tangle of trees and bushes and everything in between, anyway - I wanted a\
  \ building in ruin. I wanted one with its entrails spilled around it, trees and\
  \ thorns greedily pierced through it. And that\u2019s what I got with Buchanan castle.\
  \ I wasn\u2019t going to leave until I knew every part of it.\n\nLate November,\
  \ the end of my third month living in Glasgow on my semester abroad, we decided\
  \ to take a road trip. None of us had driven on the left side of the road before,\
  \ but the lure of the Scottish countryside decided it\u2019d had enough of our coy\
  \ flirtations and ramped up its game, and our inhibitions soon made themselves scarce.\
  \ We all felt it. In the late November sun \u2013 and yes, sun there was \u2013\
  \ the lakes seemed more blue, the grass that climbed the hills a renewed tawny,\
  \ and the looming deadline of the end of exchange we could no longer ignore.\n\n\
  We relied on the use of Google Maps. \u201CWait, zoom in on that road again \u2013\
  \ did you see that? Buchanan Castle? Should we check it out?\u201D An excited chorus\
  \ of yes! rang through the car in our Australian, French, Mexican, and Canadian\
  \ accents. We were feverish from the beauty of the morning spent on Loch Lomond\
  \ and full from our lunch of chips and Irn Bru. But we weren\u2019t yet satisfied.\
  \ Underneath it all, I was terrified. Six weeks left.\n\nOn the roads outside the\
  \ small town of Drymen, we barely had any signal on our phones, and couldn\u2019\
  t load any information aside from the seemingly-important and alluring name showing\
  \ as a little dot on our screens \u2013 Buchanan Castle. It was on our way from\
  \ Balmaha to Callander, our next destination. It was decided. We had to go.\n\n\u201C\
  Oh, no \u2013 is that it?!\u201D We were driving down the unassuming dirt road which\
  \ was to bring us to our castle. I was pointing to a large pile of broken rocks\
  \ at the end of it. I said I\u2019d wanted some sort of ruined structure, not a\
  \ cremated one. We drove past the rubble and, as the laughter at my expense died\
  \ down, saw impossible turrets peeking through the overgrowth and trunks, watched\
  \ as the skeleton of the estate rose then disappeared again as we neared it. Excitement\
  \ simmered and we climbed out of the car, stepped through bushes and ran up to the\
  \ NO ENTRY sign. \n\nIt was staggering. My eyes darted from wall to still-standing\
  \ wall, undecided on which old hallway-turned-pathway to take to explore the infinite\
  \ rooms. Huge, encased in flora, and wholly in ruin, I could barely make sense of\
  \ it. Possible scenarios were playing out before my eyes \u2013 was this the kitchen?\
  \ Where was the serving quarters? My heart raced with every circling step I climbed\
  \ of the turret \u2013 not from fear of slipping on the moss, but with the fulfilment\
  \ of my longing \u2013 and thrust my head out the window. How many people had lived\
  \ here at once? A whole clan, maybe? I waved at my friends, floors below me.\n\n\
  My fantasy of Lairds and Ladies died with the discovery of large steel beams holding\
  \ up the remains of the floor of one of the rooms. I knew the building wasn\u2019\
  t as old as I hoped, but as I watched my friends hop from room to courtyard through\
  \ the crumbling bay windows, the Scottish sun setting on us, turning the decayed\
  \ branches and floors of leaves bronze, I could keep the dream alive. Finally, I\
  \ let the satisfaction sink in. I could even ignore the manicured Buchanan Golf\
  \ Course in the backyard."
