Text: "Eyes. Messy, furred squirmings, then stillness. The crumbling foundations in\
  \ front of me were quiet. But they had taken on a conspiratorial cast now. They\
  \ were no longer remnants, but a sanctuary. Nearby, a collapsed pillar disgorged\
  \ a leaping tangle of matted fur. A hasty re-orientation followed the thing\u2019\
  s landing and the eyes appeared again, wider if possible. It was a kitten. Four\
  \ more quickly followed. Their spiky coats gave them a startled and violent appearance.\
  \ I was standing in some of the best-preserved ruins in the Middle East. But for\
  \ the next five minutes, I was, embarrassingly, absorbed by feral cats playing.\
  \ \n\nI was also surprised. The Roman ruins of Jerash in Jordan seem like a place\
  \ that would eat kittens alive. The site itself is mainly sand and hot rubble. Earthquake-scrambled\
  \ detritus heaps mark the stretches between skeletons of ancient forums, plazas\
  \ and streets. There was no food that I could see and certainly no water. As they\
  \ continued to parade aimlessly in front of me, I wondered how many skittish, unkempt\
  \ felines this shattered city housed.\n\nJerash is known as a Roman ruin, but a\
  \ host of peoples have stopped through between the Neolithic Period and now. The\
  \ jury\u2019s still out on whether Alexander the Great or one of the Ptolemies decided\
  \ to upgrade Garshu (as it was known then) from an outpost into a fully-fledged\
  \ city sometime in the fourth century BCE. Gerasa (as it was known then) really\
  \ took off once the Romans showed up early in the first century, but declined rapidly\
  \ in the mid 700s, after it was partially demolished by an earthquake. It played\
  \ a few cameos in the Crusades, but was lost until the 1800s, when it became an\
  \ archaeological drawcard. Today, the new city of Jerash sits right beside the old,\
  \ the soundscape from the former ricocheting irreverently down the cobbled, colonnaded\
  \ streets of the latter.\n\nUpon first passing through Hadrian\u2019s (other) Arch,\
  \ the hulking stone portal that leads into Jerash, I was approached by a boy selling\
  \ bamboo flutes. He sprang up from where he\u2019d been lounging, in a ragged stall\
  \ that just barely fell within the arch\u2019s shadow. The instrument he held was\
  \ a hastily hacked rod with finger holes gouged unevenly along its length. A faded\
  \ strip of red electrical tape denoted, I assumed, the end into which one blew.\
  \ He showed me how to play and then pressed the flute into my hands, refusing payment.\
  \ I was confused until he gestured to my camera with an expectant expression. Implicit\
  \ in his stance was the question \u201CSo where are we doing the interview?\u201D\
  \ \n\nI laughed at his brashness and began setting up my camera. The boy shook his\
  \ head when I asked his name, but told me in breathless fashion how the fighting\
  \ in Syria had stopped people coming to Jordan. \u201CThis is nothing\u201D, he\
  \ said, waving an arm at the stray pockets of tourists. \u201CNow they don\u2019\
  t come.\u201D\n\nAfter playing him back the footage and agreeing that the boy was\
  \ indeed now famous, I carried on into the ruins. In the North Theatre, an old man\
  \ beating a drum on the stage saw me filming and began a shuffling jig to the tune\
  \ of his friend\u2019s pipe. At the nymphaeum, a dry stone fountain designed to\
  \ attract water spirits to the city, a young couple talked earnestly and ran their\
  \ fingers through water that wasn\u2019t there.\n\nWhen I saw the kittens, I wanted\
  \ to double back and ask the boy about them. For the second time, I walked the length\
  \ of the Hippodrome, a stadium once used for chariot and horse-racing. The thrum\
  \ of unshod hooves and the desperate cheering of long-dead crowds had scarred the\
  \ track with a taut, ecstatic energy. I knelt in the dirt to better feel its pulse.\n\
  \nWhen I got back to the arch, the stall was gone. Surely there was still enough\
  \ light to hawk a flute by. I watched the warping shadow of the Oval Plaza and thought\
  \ of the desert, swallowing cats and flute-sellers."
