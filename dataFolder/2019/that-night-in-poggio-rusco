Text: "My only reason to study abroad was to travel. So as soon as my one year long\
  \ diploma in Florence, Italy began, the travel bug in me started pounding. Two weeks\
  \ later, I was in the middle of the beautiful canals of Venice. \n\nAs a little\
  \ girl, I remember cutting out pictures of Venetian canals and gondolas from magazines\
  \ and sticking it in my diary. All those childhood dreams were actually coming true.\
  \ Pizza by the bay, clich\xE9 gelato picture with water in the background, rainbow\
  \ colored houses in Burano everything that I ever saw or read about Venice was in\
  \ front of me, my happiness had no bounds. So after spending the whole weekend in\
  \ the city of fantasies, it was time to go back. And the very first glitch of that\
  \ trip happened when I boarded the wrong ferry and reached a deserted island instead\
  \ of the train station. \nI instantly started looking for the next train. By the\
  \ time I reached the station I still had forty minutes for the next one and the\
  \ sunset was worth the missed train. Never in my life would I have imagined what\
  \ happened next. \n\nI boarded the wrong train and at midnight I reached an Italian\
  \ town named Poggio Rusco. I was stranded alone in that train station at midnight\
  \ with not even a pigeon to accompany me. A tear came running down my cheeks. I\
  \ felt helpless. I thought I was going to get raped, robbed maybe killed tonight.\
  \ \nI went to kiosk to look for the next train and to my dismay there was no way\
  \ to reach Florence before 8 in the morning. There was not a single human figure\
  \ even outside the station, not even a car.  I started following the street lights\
  \ and saw a hotel which was shut and wouldn\u2019t even pick up my calls, called\
  \ a few hostels, they were closed too. \n\nLuckily, I saw three teenagers standing\
  \ near the church. I went to them for help. They did not speak English and I did\
  \ not know Italian. But we had Google Translate. After explaining them my whole\
  \ situation, I found out that it was tiny town with a mere population of six thousand\
  \ so finding a hotel or hostel for the night was next to impossible. Slowly they\
  \ understood how panicked I was. They started cheering me up, asking questions about\
  \ my trip to Venice, my experience in Italy, how my life was back in India and all\
  \ those mundane questions actually helped me calm down. We did not Google translate\
  \ after a bit. They understood my position and I knew they were my safe haven. But\
  \ the night had just begun, I had seven more hours to kill and it started getting\
  \ colder. I inquired more about the place, if I can stay in the train station overnight\
  \ or go to some bar which is open till late. Nothing worked out. In fact train station\
  \ was actually the most unsafe place for a girl at night, there were instances where\
  \ people were looted. I was shook. \nAs the night got darker, we started to get\
  \ to know each other bit more. It was my first close encounter with Italians and\
  \ everything about their culture and history mesmerized me. They were in their early\
  \ teens, flirting with each other, innocently cracking jokes and unknowingly it\
  \ made me feel belonged to the place, to the country. We spent the whole night chatting.\
  \ I do not even remember when did I fall asleep on that park bench. \n\nBut when\
  \ I got up they were gone. I did not even get an opportunity to show them my gratitude.\
  \ All my attempts of connecting them on Facebook have always failed. Since that\
  \ day I want to go to that park bench again, to find and tell them how lucky I was\
  \ to bump into them. I solemnly believe those three were true angels sent by god\
  \ to protect and safeguard me that night."
