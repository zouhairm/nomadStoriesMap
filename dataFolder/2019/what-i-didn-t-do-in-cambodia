Text: "\u201CI know you\u2019re not going to be interested, but everyone recommends\
  \ visiting the Killing Fields,\u201D I told my friend as we planned our trip to\
  \ Cambodia. \n\nI was right. She was hesitant, but open to the idea. As we walked\
  \ around the resplendent gold-topped temples of Phnom Penh and sat for lunch along\
  \ the river, we contemplated it. It would have been so easy; almost all tuk tuk\
  \ drivers in Phnom Penh offer to take you to the Killing Fields. \n\n\u201C$35 round\
  \ trip, and we go to the Killing Fields and S21. They\u2019re very important places,\u201D\
  \ they would say. \n\nThat is a word I kept hearing about it: important. We read\
  \ extensively about the history of the Khmer Rouge, as well as what we could expect\
  \ at the Killing Fields and the former prison. Having visited sites like Auschwitz,\
  \ I knew how sobering and devastating it would be. And yes, I considered that important\
  \ to see with my own eyes as well. But something about the Killing Fields felt different\
  \ to me, and I couldn\u2019t quite pinpoint why. \n\nWe met a vibrant energetic\
  \ Cambodian named Vathana who asked if we had visited the site. She proceeded to\
  \ tell us that her mother\u2019s sister and husband had died there, and that they\
  \ went there several times a year to pray for them. It hadn\u2019t occurred to me\
  \ until that moment that people who had family members murdered by the Khmer Rouge\
  \ in the 70s would have no other place but the Killing Fields to visit their remains\
  \ \u2013 the remains of people who would otherwise still be alive today. Worst of\
  \ all, it was orchestrated by people that had largely gone unpunished. Members of\
  \ the Khmer Rouge party were still active in the government until decades later.\
  \ In fact, it was during our trip in November 2019, that the courts finally convicted\
  \ two former Khmer Rouge leaders of genocide. \n\nIt wasn\u2019t until later that\
  \ it hit me why I didn\u2019t want to visit the Killing Fields. We had been having\
  \ cocktails in the themed bars of Bassac Lane when we got to talking about it. I\
  \ put myself in Vathana\u2019s shoes, and I came to the tearful realization that\
  \ if those were my family members, I wouldn\u2019t want even well-meaning strangers\
  \ to see me mourning there or to tread on the remains of my people. \n\nLearning\
  \ about the tragic history of genocide is important, but you don\u2019t have to\
  \ turn this dark place into a tourist attraction to do that. More to the point,\
  \ the horrors that Cambodians endured at the hands of Pol Pot and the Khmer Rouge\
  \ shouldn\u2019t define the entire nation or its people. Indeed, even without even\
  \ visiting the Killing Fields, we had learned so much about the Khmer Rouge and\
  \ so little about Cambodians themselves. \n\nInstead of visiting the Killing Fields,\
  \ we discovered some of the architecture and craftsmanship that Cambodians are proud\
  \ of at the National Museum in Phnom Penh. They\u2019re even the Guinness Book Record-holders\
  \ for the longest hand-woven scarf in the world, which we were able to admire in\
  \ person. At Phnom Tamao Wildlife Rescue Center, we learned about how they care\
  \ for and rehabilitate animals that have been harmed by landmines or rescued from\
  \ zoos. We took a Khmer cooking class where we got to learn to create the wonderful\
  \ and unique dishes that we had been enjoying all week. Digging into the beef lok\
  \ lak that I had cooked and plated myself was absolutely one of the highlights of\
  \ my trip. We visited the APOPO Visitor Center in Siem Reap, where we were able\
  \ to see how Cambodians are working to safely demine their countryside and make\
  \ it habitable again. We even got to see a mine-sniffing rat demonstrate his skills.\
  \ Of course, we learned about the religious history of Cambodia at Angkor Wat, and\
  \ also the day-to-day life of monks in the Buddhist temples and monasteries. \n\n\
  The Killing Fields may be important, but they should not overshadow the rich Cambodian\
  \ culture the country has to offer. I rather know how Cambodians live than how they\
  \ died."
