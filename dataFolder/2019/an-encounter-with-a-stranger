Text: "I wanted to explore the Aravali Mountains , so went to Udaipur .\nIt was dark\
  \ and I have lost connection with my group and was lost in jungle.\nI didn't have\
  \ anything with me except a torch and my travel kit . I was starving as I had spent\
  \ all my energy in finding my friends. I was alone and really scared and then suddenly\
  \ I heard sound of someone's footsteps and they were approaching towards me. At\
  \ that moment I prayed to god to protect me and send someone to rescue me. I hid\
  \ myself behind the bushes as I was really scared . Then suddenly someone's hand\
  \ came towards me and I started crying and begging him to not harm me . He held\
  \  my hand and pulled me out of the bushes and then he gently removed the leaves\
  \ stuck in my hair. He looked  into my eyes with his hands on my \n cheeks with\
  \ an expression full of compassion. I don't know  what happened but I stopped crying\
  \ and then he started going somewhere and I don't know why but I followed him. After\
  \ walking for a while I heard the voice of my friends calling me out and I responded\
  \ to them and then I looked in front and I saw that man disappear somewhere. After\
  \ that I was able to return safely to my home .\nBut at times I still wonder who\
  \ was that stranger who suddenly appeared in front of me when I was in  danger and\
  \ helped me to return safely to my friends and family . I hope in this lifetime\
  \ I get a chance to encounter that stranger and thank him for saving me."
