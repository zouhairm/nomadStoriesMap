Text: "All travelers can make mistakes when packing. Even those with good mileage\
  \ in the luggage. With me, it happened, and it was in San Francisco. Led by the\
  \ \"oba oba\" combination vacation + American summer + California, I filled up my\
  \ suitcase with dresses, skirts, shorts and bikinis. Result: thermometers scoring\
  \ 7 \xB0 C throughout the week. Elementary my dear Watson! No wonder the American\
  \ comedian Mark Twain kept repeating that \"the coldest winter in his life was a\
  \ summer in San Francisco.\" And if it's not cold, my friend, it's the gusting wind.\
  \ Or the haze that hides the top of the skyscrapers, the Golden Gate, Alcatraz Island,\
  \ and San Francisco Bay in the morning and late afternoon. But, hey, listen: ignore\
  \ the weather, because nothing can take away the brightness of America's most hippie,\
  \ libertine, open minded, cosmopolitan, transgressive, LGBT and sustainable city.\n\
  On the first day, I caught this vibe echoing along the boardwalk of Fisherman's\
  \ Wharf, SanFran's most touristy spot, and in the Castro neighbourhood \u2013 a\
  \ mega gay territory \u2013 and in Haight-Ashbury, the cradle of hippie culture\
  \ in the 1960s. The historical milestone of this all you need is love movement is\
  \ right in the corner between Haight and Ashbury streets, where the memorable Summer\
  \ of Love of 1967, fuelled by sex, drugs and rock 'n' roll, was more intense than\
  \ in any other part of the world. \nIn this same footprint of trampling paradigms,\
  \ San Francisco has also become the greenest American city. There are bike lanes\
  \ scattered everywhere so the tourist can put aside the idea of hiring a car. Not\
  \ that San Francisco is a haven for bikers. The city's geography has hillsides that\
  \ defy gravity, such as the iconic Lombard Street and its eight zigzag curves on\
  \ a bluff. But the bike can lead to icons. Cycling the nearly 3 km from Golden Gate\
  \ to Sausalito is a must-do. Even if the traffic is heavy, park the bike somewhere\
  \ along the bridge to enjoy the view. The island that you will see facing the San\
  \ Francisco skyline is Alcatraz, the maximum-security prison that housed Al Capone,\
  \ Chicago's greatest gangster in the 1920s, and the Anglin brothers, who after a\
  \ spectacular escape, no one ever heard again.\nJust thinking about entering the\
  \ same tiny cells that housed the worst American criminals, my body shivered. But\
  \ taken by a brave shock, I made up my mind to do the tour at night, when all get\
  \ a much nebulous air to what was already dramatic enough.\nAlcatraz tours start\
  \ at Pier 33, at the trendy Fisherman's Wharf, where ferries depart and reach the\
  \ island in 15 minutes. After the shock of emotion, I strolled in Fisherman's Wharf.\
  \ Here is the nervous artery of San Francisco, the Embarcadero, a sidewalk facing\
  \ the bay, with attractions and restaurants end-to-end, addressed according to the\
  \ pier number. Pier 39 is the most popular corner thanks to the sea lions that spread\
  \ on the wooden platforms for sunbathing. In winter, they number more than a thousand.\
  \ Not even one sea lion tried to take the plunge in so many times that I went through\
  \ a spy. Who cares? With lots of things to do on the pier, I quickly forgot about\
  \ them.\n\nVibe old school\nIn times when modernity designs high-speed trains, San\
  \ Francisco goes against the tide once again. Its cable car, a tireless worker since\
  \ 1873, makes hundreds of trips daily to connect the lower and upper part of the\
  \ city. The cable car does three routes, but the one that passes Union Square, climbs\
  \ the slope of Nob Hill and descends until Fisherman's Wharf has maximum stocking\
  \ always.\nFrom Union Square, I went straight to the Castro district, the Californian\
  \ gay mecca, to enjoy what it has best: its old bars. Sitting at the Twin Peaks\
  \ Tavern, with my appletini in hand, I found myself philosophizing: how good it\
  \ is to visit San Francisco, a city that remains iconoclastic, surviving from transgressions\
  \ and with an irreducible mania to leave everyone with a feeling of returning \u2013\
  \ for me, next time, with the right suitcase..."
