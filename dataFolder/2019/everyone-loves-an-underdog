Text: "At almost 80 metres tall, Cristo Rei (Christ the King), the Portuguese cousin\
  \ of the famous Christ the Redeemer statue in Rio de Janeiro, gazes over the city\
  \ of Lisbon, his feet firmly planted in and his back conspicuously turned upon the\
  \ lesser-known Portuguese city and municipality of Almada. It\u2019s hard not to\
  \ see the symbolism here. Particularly considering that in the last few years, Lisbon\
  \ has become one of Europe\u2019s most popular cities for professional millennials\
  \ from all over the continent who have taken advantage of the EU\u2019s free movement\
  \ of people to come and work, often freelance, in the city. Lisbon has been singled\
  \ out not only for its beautiful climate but also its cheap rent. However, this\
  \ is all relative, as for the average Portuguese person on an average wage, the\
  \ rent rates in Lisbon are anything but cheap. And so, many Portuguese people are\
  \ leaving the city and settling across the river in Almada.\n      When I arrive\
  \ by the Transtejo Ferry from Lisbon, it is a beautiful day. The sky is clear as\
  \ stained glass and the pale sun teases us with the first hints of spring. Standing\
  \ 192 metres above the river, Cristo Rei gives us his open-armed welcome. Ponte\
  \ 25 de Abril, twin of the Golden Gate Bridge in San Francisco, stretches over the\
  \ river, the movement of traffic like the humming of bees. On our approach to the\
  \ port of Cacilhas, I notice rows and rows of abandoned buildings, old factories\
  \ and warehouses, spanning the length of the waterfront like ghosts of past prosperity.\
  \ \n      The irresistible smell of grilled fish greets me as I step off the boat\
  \ and a woman selling figs sings about how fresh they are. Over the last five or\
  \ six years, there has been a steady rejuvenation of Cacilhas, starting with the\
  \ main strip where you will find dozens of restaurants and bars ranging from typical\
  \ Portuguese \u2018tascas\u2019, to an artisan beer bar, aptly named \u2018Birraria\u2019\
  . \n      In the empty buildings along the harbourfront, life has taken over. Peering\
  \ through the smashed windows, I see a jungle of plant life inside what once would\
  \ have been highly industrial spaces, the juxtaposition is eerie and beautiful.\
  \ The fronts of the buildings are covered with graffiti, from simple tags to genuine\
  \ works of art. I pass two men in overalls attaching bait to fishing lines, then\
  \ turning a corner, find rows of blue chairs and white umbrellas. There are two\
  \ restaurants at this end of the harbour. The first is Atira-te ao Rio (Throw Yourself\
  \ to the River), which features Portuguese food with a modern, high-dining twist.\
  \ Around the corner is Ponto Final, which means full-stop - literally the final\
  \ point on the waterfront - where traditional Portuguese food is served. Both have\
  \ spectacular views over Lisbon. \n      I speak to F\xE1bio Gon\xE7alves, an Almada\
  \ native and chef, who tells me of the many changes he\u2019s seen since returning\
  \ a year ago from working in England. He believes that investment is a good thing\
  \ for Almada, particularly for the Portuguese business owners who live here, but\
  \ that eventually, it could end up in a similar situation to Lisbon with rents and\
  \ house prices rising. He says there is a strong sense of identity here and worries\
  \ that some of this could be lost, telling me about a hostel which recently opened\
  \ close by called Lisbon South. He laughs and says he isn\u2019t sure how people\
  \ will respond to that.  \n      I feel myself rooting for the underdog Almada as\
  \ she bears, with a Portuguese mix of playfulness and pessimism, the changes of\
  \ the times. Whether it will benefit the people here or push them even further out\
  \ is yet to be seen. As I sit outside the restaurant, the river lapping gently against\
  \ the harbour wall, I watch the sky fill with the pinks and purples of a truly breath-taking\
  \ sunset and hope for the best for this charming, misunderstood city and its friendly,\
  \ fascinating people."
