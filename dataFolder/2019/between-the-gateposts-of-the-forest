Text: "My phone was slowly dying. Every time I took it out to reaffirm that I was\
  \ indeed going the way I wanted to go it died a little more. Though the day had\
  \ been bright, the late afternoon had brought with it a chilly wind, a reminder\
  \ that it was no longer summer and that I had yet to reach my destination. \n\n\
  It was my own fault. I hadn\u2019t been paying attention when I switched trains\
  \ in Frankfurt. So instead of getting on the S4, I had gotten on the S5. Both train\
  \ lines will take you to the borders of the Taunus mountain range, but once outside\
  \ of Frankfurt, they do not intercept. So if I had wanted to change, it would have\
  \ meant even more time lost. And as it was I had already gotten off to a late start.\
  \ \n\nIt didn\u2019t trouble me. Not at first. Though I had never ventured into\
  \ these woods before, I figured my only problem lay in finding the fastest route\
  \ into the mountainous forest. \n\nWhen I finally reached what I thought were the\
  \ outskirts of Oberursel, I did not so much as enter the forest as I did isolated\
  \ pockets of trees enclosed all around by human habitation. On this day, the Taunus\
  \ seemed to be more alive with people than it did trees.  It was as though everyone,\
  \ myself included, was out to enjoy the last of the good weather before the year\
  \ plunged into winter. \n\nAt length, the trees began to thicken, their canopies\
  \ slowly shutting out all rays of light. The path I had thought to follow, the one\
  \ that should have taken me up to the Saalburg pass, suddenly vanished beneath the\
  \ leaf litter. Undeterred, I kept following the path on my phone until I came upon\
  \ a barbed wire fence enclosing what appeared to be an archery range. Through the\
  \ wire, I could see life-sized figures of game animals; their bodies riddled with\
  \ the markings of arrows. Signs all around warned against trespassing. And yet my\
  \ phone adamantly insisted that I cut through. \n\n\u201CNo thanks,\u201D I said\
  \ and turned around. I had no desire to get caught on the tip of a hunter\u2019\
  s bow. There was, no doubt, some other way of getting around. I did not know how\
  \ extensive the grounds of the archery range were, but I figured that if I followed\
  \ the fence line it would lead me to a path that I could reliably follow. \n\nThe\
  \ way down was time-consuming, but at last I reached a path and it took me to the\
  \ banks of a woodland stream that ran adjacent to a road. I could hear the low rumble\
  \ of cars even through the trees. Comforted, I checked my phone again and laughed.\
  \ Now it was telling me to cut across a small highway or turn back. \n\nSo much\
  \ effort just to go hiking in a forest! But it would be worth it. So I crossed the\
  \ stream and then crossed the road. Now on the other side, I could appreciate the\
  \ late autumn sun as it struck the trees with the last of its blood-gold light.\
  \ Pity the moment was to be fleeting. \n\nUntil now the frequency at which I had\
  \ encountered signs of human existence had left me with the impression that the\
  \ jaws of the Taunus could not fully close down upon me. But the now rapidly fading\
  \ light seemed to loosen this grip. It was as if the forest were a wolf whose bite\
  \ was only held back for as long as the sun held its sway. There was no telling\
  \ what night would bring.\n\nWistfully, I changed course and made my way down the\
  \ mountainside by the light of my dying phone. The hike to Bad Homburg, a city not\
  \ too far from Oberursel, also took longer than expected. It was almost as if the\
  \ Taunus was now as reluctant to let me out as it had been to let me in. \n\n\u201C\
  If you should stray from the path,\u201D I murmured to myself sternly, \u201Cthe\
  \ wild beasts will eat you.\u201D With this I shook off the sway of the forest.\
  \ Though I so wanted to linger."
