Text: "After the rural Isle of Skye in the UK, this experience will be the next country\
  \ that I visit in my 3 month solo trip. The place located in the foot of Mount Blanco,\
  \ the highest peak in Europe, 2 hour from Torino, Italy. I don\u2019t expect that\
  \ this would be in Aosta Valley that is extremely beautiful, at least for me. Located\
  \ in the border of France and Switzerland, this place has the ranges of Alpens and\
  \ people can speak French very well. The water flow in the river is not black or\
  \ blue, but white greenish. \n\nI can\u2019t stop starring at this river and waterfall\
  \ from the local train window. I may be the only Indonesian people in this train\
  \ as people stare at me like alien. I keep wondering, \u201Cwhat the heck Rahma\
  \ that you can find this place by yourself, and you don\u2019t go to the mainstream\
  \ place that many people come like Rome, Milan, Venice, etc\u201D. Suddenly, those\
  \ mainstream place gone from my list. This is much more beautiful, and I need more\
  \ time to explore this paradise. I always think, what makes me able to find many\
  \ hidden gems. It may because I always travel for purpose. To learn something.\n\
  \ \nArriving in the NUS train station with the view surounded by mountain. I got\
  \ so excited. In my mind, what\u2019s next?\n\nA woman came to me. \u201CAre you\
  \ Rahma?\u201D. The woman was in my age, about 20s something named Selena. So, in\
  \ Italy, I decided to learn about agritourismo by staying in local people and learning\
  \ from them. This woman is my host, and I never expect that she can speak English\
  \ very well. She explains that the agritourismo farm is owned by her father, mother,\
  \ and herself. So, three of them is the main worker, there is other one named Felix\
  \ who comes every two days, an African man from Nigeria who, every-time speaks English\
  \ with me, makes me confused because of his mixed english-Italian language.\n\n\
  Arriving to this beautiful village named Cherolinaz, again I didn\u2019t expect\
  \ that this will be extremely beautiful. This place is a workshop and also a home.\
  \ They produce many different types of jams, spices, and honey. There are three\
  \ floors, and each floors faces the mountain and other small villages. At nights,\
  \ the lights of the village across the home, million stars and the moon make this\
  \ home has perfect view for contemplating. The top floor is the main home where\
  \ Selena parents -Marissa and Sergio- lived and where we will eat together. In the\
  \ second lower floor is a guest room. My room has an italian style decorated with\
  \ lots of colorful flower, roof fence with grapes and the stone wall. They have\
  \ spooky but pretty cave-look-like room next to my room that they will use as BnB\
  \ in the near future. Now, it is still empty, and use only for displaying their\
  \ products and storing the potatoes. \n\nThey welcome me with the afternoon tea,\
  \ at least that is what british called, and shows the picture book of their work\
  \ in early work of this place, empowering disabilities. Deep in my mind, I know\
  \ that their story will be another extraordinary inspiration for me. They shows\
  \ the picture made by someone who experts in telling story with the pictures, I\
  \ don\u2019t remember the name, storylogist, picturelogist, you named it. Every\
  \ picture in the album has its own history and meaning. Selena\u2019s family want\
  \ to teach these kids to be independent, living without parents here in the rural\
  \ Aosta Valley. So, Marissa, Sergio, and Selena provided accommodation, taught them\
  \ everyday, went to vacation in the free time, and made them write reflective writing\
  \ every day after finishing their activity. What a beautiful program that they created\
  \ for disability people. \n\nAfter listening their story and see the album, I see\
  \ that no matter where you live, you still can give impact to the society, like\
  \ what Selena and Marissa did in the rural Aosta Valley. From this place, the concept\
  \ of helping human being  wherever I am and whatever I do will keep staying in my\
  \ mind. Working for humanity and be friend with nature Selena called it."
