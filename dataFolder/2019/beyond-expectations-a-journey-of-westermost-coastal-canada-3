Text: "I certainly hadn\u2019t anticipated meeting a reclusive famous French artist,\
  \ while on a journey of Westcoast Canada. The personalities I encountered proved\
  \ exotic beyond imagination, and punctuated my rich experience. I began this journey\
  \ with my companion \u201CMorrison\u201D \u2013 My aging VW Westfalia -  and departed\
  \ Vancouver, Canada, via Horseshoe Bay. Perhaps the place names drew me: \u2018\
  Sunshine Coast\u2019; \u2018Secret Cove;  \u2018Garden Bay\u2019 - as the gateway\
  \ to \u2018Desolation Sound\u2019. Promising idyllic intrigue. I planned to finish\
  \ in Parksville, Vancouver Island. Normally, I usually travel with conscious purpose\
  \ of discovering rich textures, for pen and camera. But not this time. My purpose\
  \ was simple: Quietude.\n\nVancouver behind me, I arrived by scenic ferry to Gibsons,\
  \ known as birthplace to the 1970\u2019s seafaring television series \u2018The Beachcombers\u2019\
  \ \u2013 featuring eccentric  seafaring personalities. While I knew the region well,\
  \ from prior sailboat adventures, this trip would be different, behind the wheels\
  \ Of Morrison.\n\nMy adventure continued with a hike at secluded \u2018Secret Cove\u2019\
  \ - a waterfront park near Sechelt. Hinted glimpses of massive cedars, fluorescent\
  \ glowing moss and lichen, and hints I\u2019d the hidden cove beyond, suggested\
  \ A place of wonder. No other visitors greeted my solitude. Later, driving north\
  \ from Sechelt, I expected a quiet, uneventful evening, as secluded \u2018Garden\
  \ Bay\u2019 suggested. Perfect!! I turned off the Sunshine Coast highway proceeding\
  \ down a winding 12km road, as early dusk encased unpredictable January skies. \n\
  \nWhen I arrived, my host Philippe leaned over the balcony with broad grin and beckoning\
  \ wave. I anticipated an early night.  My first glances of the simple home revealed\
  \ massive paintings, blazing with pure colours, and hard-line abstract images. Philippe\
  \ had stylized them in \u2018cookie cutter\u2019 fashion. The bright, lively art\
  \ woke me from my purposed reflection. What was this artist trying to convey through\
  \ abstract style? What was his passion over his guitar? My mind flooded with questions.\
  \ Philippe simply reflected \u201CI do not hold intention in my painting; I leave\
  \ this to the beholder.\u201D Sounded simple, right? My rational mind couldnt find\
  \ apparent meaning. I asked Philippe, who simply stated, \u201CI paint in \u2018\
  pure stream\u2019, so why don\u2019t you sleep on it, and tell me in the morning.\u201D\
  \ \n\nMy evening began with sampling a renowned French libation, known as \u2018\
  Kir Royale\u2019- a French aperitif that combined champagne with blackcurrant liqueur.\
  \ Delicious!! Philippe spoke of his Parisian family, his artistic journey, and told\
  \ me, \u201CI knew I was a painter at 4 years old age.\u201D He stated, \u201CMy\
  \ family encouraged my art, yet didn\u2019t understand my passion as a painter.\
  \ They didn\u2019t understand the direction my art took.\u201D Our discussion flew\
  \ from Philippe\u2019s worldwide shows, family life, our respective musical experiences,\
  \ to Philippe\u2019s rare guitar, views on education, and more. \n\nMy impressions\
  \ of Philippe\u2019s art came unexpectedly: At 3am. With heart pounding wildly,\
  \ my gaze rested on Philippe\u2019s massive canvas on the bedroom wall. It glowed\
  \ brightly in black-light focus. Sharp images suggested new, frightening meaning.\
  \ The contrast was striking, compared to a viewing under natural light.\n\nThe next\
  \ morning, with inviting scent of warm French bread in the air, I shared my reflections\
  \ with Philippe. He further spoke how the painting had originally sold through art\
  \ auction. The buyer had taken it, yet later returned the piece to Philippe, with\
  \ no expectations of return compensation. I wondered why, but never found out.\n\
  \nI had never expected that my journey of solitude would be punctuated with meeting\
  \ a reclusive and famous French artist named Philippe Sokazo."
