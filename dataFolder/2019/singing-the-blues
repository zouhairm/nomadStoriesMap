Text: "It was my fault. I was hoping to find a place to stay for free with some friends\
  \ but they had to go outstate for the weekend and I waited until the last minute\
  \ to pay for an extra night at my hostel in the Chicago area known as The Loop.\
  \ Very hip, cheap, and comfortable. Of course when I went to the front desk they\
  \ told me that there were no rooms, no beds, no nothing available. Thinking about\
  \ my thin wallet, I sat in the living room with the purpose of use the hostel wifi\
  \ and to find a very cheap room. I couldn't help to hear the conversation of another\
  \ 3 people there who were in the same problem as me. Since it was Friday, everything\
  \ in the area was full or very  expensive. I started to talk with them, sharing\
  \ the options I had so far. They shared theirs with me and we compare. We talked\
  \ about some other subjects and we become friends immediately. A curious group indeed:\
  \ A very beautiful girl from Turkey, a very tall (huge) guy from Germany, an extremely\
  \ weird guy from Washington and me (I think I had a very punk look by those days\
  \ - Mexican guy). After maybe one hour and a half knowing each other and surfing\
  \ the web, Washington found a very strange add: A cheap hostel that charges half\
  \ price if you are a musician and with enough space for the four of us, but it was\
  \ a little far from downtown. I said -Hey! It's just perfect for me! Washington\
  \ and Germany played piano and they were very excited about it. Turkey said -Ok,\
  \ I don't play any instrument or sing but is still cheap, let\u2019s go! We went\
  \ out and took the train thinking, this is to good to be true. The Hostel were about\
  \ an hour and a half and during the trip I tried to teach Turkey how to sing to\
  \ get the discount. We also started to know each other a little better. At the beginning,\
  \ I found Washington extremely weird, with a funny voice and a particular way to\
  \ talk that seemed he was drunk but he wasn\u2019t, strange and exaggerated body\
  \ movements and he couldn\u2019t stay still for half second. Later on, I found that\
  \ Germany and Turkey had the same impression of him. We finally arrived to the hostel\
  \ and it was amazing. An old big wooden house in a very quiet neighborhood. But\
  \ we could listen to the music coming from there almost from the train station.\
  \ The smiling girl who opened the door was extremely happy to see us and gave us\
  \ candy. Inside there was maybe ten people having a blues jam and another ten just\
  \ watching or dancing. Paradise for me. They had a piano, two drum sets, basses,\
  \ guitars, harmonicas, ukuleles\u2026 you name it. The singer was a black girl who\
  \ hypnotized the entire room with a lovely but strong voice. I got a guitar and\
  \ joined them. Surprisingly,  Turkey started to sing and she did it very well! People\
  \ came and went during the night, and I just can\u2019t leave the room. By dawn\
  \ we were only 5 people included Washington, who was an extremely good pianist.\
  \ I received two good lessons that night. A master on blues guitar and singing,\
  \ and that weird people are the best friends ever. I discovered that Washington\
  \ was definitely not a common person, but he was super funny and talented. The four\
  \ of us stayed there for almost a week, playing occasionally, knowing Chicago together,\
  \ going to places, drinking and having a good time. Then we had to continue our\
  \ trips, leaving one by one this incredible place full of art and cool people. We\
  \ are still friends, and we love to share our travel pictures and stories. A year\
  \ ago I saw Turkey in France. Washington is going to Germany in a couple of months\
  \ and we hope to meet in Dubai for the next World cup. I will bring my guitar to\
  \ continue singing the blues with them."
