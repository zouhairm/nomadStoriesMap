Text: "Above was the scorching sun but my heart was beating loud with zeal because\
  \ I was about to explore this part of the country for the first time. Maharastra.\
  \ I reached my friend Vinayak\u2019s village Jamkhed. I was greeted with a great\
  \ Maharashtrian lunch Puran pori (a chapatti that has been filled with a stuffing\
  \ of sweetened lentils paste served with Amti a super spicy chickpea soup). I was\
  \ interviewed of my whereabouts, family, why I travel so, what good is freelancing,\
  \ why vegetarian and the interview continued for the entire evening. Although enjoying\
  \ yet I was exhausted answering all the new relatives or neighbors who kept on coming\
  \ to see this new kind of creature that was me. I was longing to see a real, extremely\
  \ rustic village of this region. Next day Vinayak and I rode a bike to a remote\
  \ village, Jikri . It was sunset. Steep, narrow, muddy, dusty lanes, cattle following\
  \ their shepherd leader, women walking with shinning steel pots over their heads,\
  \ some with earthen pots walking in a ramp-like fashion. We arrived at the cattle\
  \ farm of Vinayak\u2019s relative. Few goats, cows, and a super vigilante dog to\
  \ safeguard this little property. I enjoyed my moments of surprises with such a\
  \ setting while my friend, my translator kept on exchanging information from my\
  \ end to the relatives' end. Dinner was at the residence which was a bit far away.\
  \ I was welcomed with tilak and throwing off some rice over my head, as their custom\
  \ a guest I like a God and so I was theirs. Vinayak told we will have \u2018Hoorda\u2019\
  \ with Chattni. \u2018Hoorda\u2019 is basically Jowar roasted and then beaten to\
  \ extract the edible part out of the sticks of Jowar, a very interesting, process\
  \ to watch indeed. The output wasn\u2019t a big quantity and am sure it was made\
  \ only for me, this realization brought mixed feelings. I felt special, at the same\
  \ time I felt bad for their extra work and also that the three little kids were\
  \ not offered, in fact strictly instructed that it is only for the guests.\nWhen\
  \ we(only Men) sat for dinner everyone had steel glass except for me  who was given\
  \ a glass of glass. The fact that kids and women eat only after men they made me\
  \ feel a bit bad. I noticed the kids looking at my face, staring at my glass. The\
  \ youngest said \u201CKaki, tyan na kasa  glaasbharun pani dila pyayla ani amhala\
  \ roz fakta itakusach pani detis\u201D (aunty why is he given a full glass of water\
  \ but every day you give us so little ?Vinayak translated with hesitation when I\
  \ insisted on the child\u2019s gesture at me ) I saw the men who were dining with\
  \ me, didn\u2019t have a full glass of water. My friend explained with a very hard\
  \ face that this area is experiencing drought since last 2 years. Drinkable water\
  \ is fetched from a village almost 15 kms away. If everyone drinks full glass of\
  \ water it is impossible to keep up with water that they have got. The ladies fetch\
  \ water every alternate day. This revelation shook me from within. These beautiful\
  \ people with such honest and big hearts, watery, sparkling eyes and wide smiles\
  \ were in a war wasn\u2019t a thought that I was able to hold. They have minimized\
  \ cooking age-old traditional dishes as those need more water. The kids are losing\
  \ their tradition and heading for a future that is dry. And I who was a God for\
  \ one night for them couldn\u2019t even do anything at all. I was thinking that\
  \ my glass of water was practically owned by those kids. The excitement of exploring\
  \ village life, village cuisine and customs were all subsided with some heartbreaking\
  \ and ground truth that Climate change isn\u2019t just an issue for world stages\
  \ and spokespersons but it is here and hitting most in the corners. For me, I didn\u2019\
  t expect to find myself believing it in this way. This experience changed the way\
  \ I handled my resources totally. I didn\u2019t expect to find a night in Jikri\
  \ teach me climate change, Sustainability, and Compassion."
