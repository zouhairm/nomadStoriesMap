Text: "People sneaked out, and I walked in front of the crowd, like a general with\
  \ a warrior. With a command, they followed me in a neat uniform and went to the\
  \ battlefield.\nThis is the ninth day when I came to Ethiopia. The weather is dry\
  \ and the nose is bleeding for a long time. I can't stop my enthusiasm for this\
  \ mysterious land.\nI feel the character of the Ethiopian depicted in the historical\
  \ script The Star of Ethiopia. Humility, freedom, and hope are different from the\
  \ Chinese character. Most African countries in the economy want to be the next \"\
  small China\", but where is the way out?\nWe may be the 1 millionth team to find\
  \ the answer.\nAfter talking with the Minister of Science and Technology of Ethiopia\
  \ and the ambassador, there was a sense of mission. After the new president took\
  \ office, the new policy of opening up will be launched in recent months, and the\
  \ technology and business model will gradually reform. The minister attaches importance\
  \ to the development of e-commerce as an individual empowerment, which means opportunities\
  \ and challenges. Political turmoil, high taxes, backward infrastructure, local\
  \ legal persons, power shortages and shortage of foreign currency have hampered\
  \ investment by foreign companies.\nCreate agricultural business cards or copy the\
  \ essence of Asian industrialization or technological innovation.\nI hope that we\
  \ can see Ethiopia\u2019s economic take-off and the rise of the nation as soon as\
  \ possible."
