Text: 'It''s evening time and sky is covered with ruby red and dark blue colours.
  I''m on to colony, a childhood place on mine to stroll. Well, as a 23 years old
  university student I too can be called a child. The locals are same as they would
  be in every place, straight to their work but what makes my colony different from
  other places is its calm location and extensiveness. There''s a playground here.
  Children come here to play football, my favourite sport. Sometimes, I too join them.
  The game goes from dusk till late in evening. Thanks to street lights, the children
  seem as in some school while playing there and learning how to live together with
  peace.

  One day, while strolling in colony, I saw my old school friend, Kashish, coming
  to his home. He was on bike and it was bullet. He saw me first. I couldn''t recognise
  him due to the helmet. He invited me to his garage near his home and colony to light
  some ganja, so we went.

  We sat at his garage, had ganja and talked about past lives we had together and
  what we gonna do after our studies.

  After nearly half an hour I left and joined kids at colony to play football. It
  was a cool evening, the sky was of ruby red and dark blue colours.

  We all were playing under street lights like we were in some school, learning how
  to live together in peace.

  Here I reside, in a town called sanjauli, and in it a peaceful and calm colony.
