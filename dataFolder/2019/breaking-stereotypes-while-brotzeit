Text: "It was March of 2016, I had two big suitcases on my hands and I was holding\
  \ hard my cellphone in order to remember all the train stops and not get lost. While\
  \ the train was leaving the snow behind and going into a kind of spring paradise,\
  \ I couldn\u2019t stop wonder if I was going to survive.  It was going to be my\
  \ first job ever and it was located 9000 km away from my home.  I was born in Barranquilla\
  \ - Colombia, a big and colorful city, where being cheerful and loud are keys to\
  \ success.  But then I was there in Regensburg - Germany, I MEAN GERMANY,  a country\
  \ that is \u201Cfamous\u201D for people with strict, reserved and strong personalities;\
  \ the kind of genius that have invented great companies as Siemens, Bosch, Mercedes\
  \ Benz, BMW, Volkswagen, etc.  \u201COMG, will I understand anything?  Will I be\
  \ accepted?\u201D I said.  I took a big breath and finally arrived.  A nice guy,\
  \ my new flatmate,  was waiting for me.  The man was double of my height but, against\
  \ all my predictions, he was talkative, cooperative and kind. While we were carrying\
  \ my suitcases home I realised I was in Grimm\u2019s brothers tale. The houses,\
  \ the church, the streets, the lights seemed to be detained on time. All my senses\
  \ were on alert, the smell of  Wei\xDFwurst and traditional beer were all around,\
  \ moreover people`s joy on celebrating FC Bayern Munich game was crazy. Finally\
  \ my fears were appeased, I was home, I survived my first day.\n\n\nOn March 14th\
  \ at 8:00 am, I arrived to Maschinenfabrik Reinhausen, a German company that has\
  \ worked on electrical engineering products for more than 100 years. Obviously I\
  \ got my best outfit and was ready to impress. For my surprise I was introduced\
  \ to three relaxed clothed and happy old men that were not the typical strong and\
  \ grumpy guys I was expecting. They told me they were interested in Latin American\
  \ market and they hoped my engineering knowledge and language could help them find\
  \ market strategies (Yes, I was a kind of spy). I received my direction and was\
  \ on my way to work hard when suddenly someone yelled \u201CBROTZEIT\u201D.  I thought\
  \ \u201Cbreadtime at 9:00 am?\u201D, everybody was going out and I followed them;\
  \ at the end of the  hall I found German bread paradise: Pretzel, Milchbr\xF6tchen\
  \ (Milk Bread), Sonnenblumenbrot (Sunflower Bread) and all kinds of sausages were\
  \ sold for insignificant prices.  After that day I never had breakfast at home.\
  \  5 PM came and was time to go home, I decided to walk all the way home. Regensburg\
  \ amazed me even more, the Danube river crosses the city allowing people to navigate\
  \ it in small boats  and to have gorgeous gardens on the river bank; houses are\
  \ painted with bright colors and coffee shops have a combination of cozy and vintage\
  \ styles.  My feelings were totally transformed, I was falling in love with Regensburg\
  \ and there was not turning back.\n\nOn my following days at work I met more German\
  \ people.  My colleagues turned to be totally different than I expected. Those guys\
  \ were full of dreams and joy of living; they were very interested to learn about\
  \ other countries cultures, they loved to dance latin music and even my three bosses,\
  \ the three cute old men I mentioned before, always reminded me the German 7- Brazil\
  \ 1 game on world cup 2014 for fun, even though I am Colombian. Going to work everyday\
  \ was a great adventure, each one was responsible of his or her time management\
  \ and work results were shared for positive correction and improvement encourage.\
  \ German people won my heart day by day and I learnt that stereotypes should not\
  \ be the basis of the any argument. \n\nOn July 10th it was time to go home, I had\
  \ learned so much about my professional career and about being an independent adult\
  \ in an such incredibly fascinating place that I had nothing more but gratitude\
  \ for Regensburg and its people. Back home I was a totally new person; a fearless\
  \ and open-minded woman that wanted to destroy other people\u2019s stereotypical\
  \ ideas."
