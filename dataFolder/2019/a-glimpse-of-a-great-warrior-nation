Text: "Winding our way along the dusty Zululand road, my boyfriend and I are suddenly\
  \ thrust into a noisy throng of minibus taxis, cars and people. \n\nDozens of women\
  \ are selling food. Some with bags of shocking orange cheese puffs laid out on blankets\
  \ and others under gazebos with catering-size pots of amagwinya or vetkoek, a traditional\
  \ Afrikaner fried dough filled with mince. \n\nThe entire community and more have\
  \ turned out to celebrate the 139th anniversary of the Battle of Isandlwana, beneath\
  \ the oddly shaped hill, iconic to South African history. \n\nIt was here that,\
  \ on the 22nd January 1879, 1 700 British soldiers bravely defended their camp at\
  \ the base of Isandlwana against a 25 000-strong Zulu army. Defeated, the battle\
  \ remains one of the greatest military disasters in Victorian history. \n\nFor the\
  \ Zulu nation, however, their victory remains one of their greatest triumphs. \n\
  \nMinutes after we arrive in the carpark, the amabutho (Zulu regiments), in full\
  \ traditional regalia advance down the road behind us. Chanting amahubo (historic\
  \ war songs), the group of only a hundred or so men feel impressive. \n\nThe warriors,\
  \ comprised of local amakhosi (chiefs), izinduna (headmen), elders and young men\
  \ are dressed in their traditional regalia for this special occasion: handsome skins\
  \ and furs, feathers and car-tyre sandals, along with spears, knobkieries and imposing\
  \ war shields. It\u2019s a sight to behold. \n\nThey\u2019re greeted by an ululating\
  \ crowd and march down a side-road to wait for the official ceremony to begin. \n\
  \nOn a cordoned-off section of the battlefield, members of the public, the press,\
  \ VIPs and tourists are filling up designated seating areas in front of a large\
  \ concert stage. With no desire to sit like goats in a pen, we take some time to\
  \ walk around.  \n\nThe \u2018Dundee Diehards\u2019, dressed as British soldiers,\
  \ rehearse their re-enactment on the foothill of the famous site: Isandlwana means\
  \ \u2018little house\u2019 in Zulu, although we think the hill looks more like a\
  \ saddle or a shoe.\n\nThe ceremony is running late \u2013 typical \u2018African-time\u2019\
  \ \u2013 and the large crowds on the battlefield seem suffocating so we decide to\
  \ go in search of the amabutho.\n\nFollowing the side-road they took, we come to\
  \ a smaller field where they\u2019ve gathered in a close-knit huddle, humming. The\
  \ atmosphere is reverential. \n\nWhen the group breaks formation, singing low, we\
  \ find out why - the leader of the Zulu nation, King Goodwill Zwelithini emerges\
  \ and is ushered into a sleek black SUV. The motorcade, followed by the chanting\
  \ amabutho and ululating women, now make their way to the battlefield.  \n\nCameras\
  \ in hand, we\u2019re absorbed into the thrumming entourage. \n\nHurriedly walking\
  \ backwards, trying not to trip over a rock while videoing the advancing amabutho,\
  \ my eyes meet with one of the elders. He smiles in an appreciative sort of way,\
  \ but also as if he knows that I\u2019m trying not to fall over. \n\nIt\u2019s a\
  \ silent, but authentic connection. For a brief moment, in his shining eyes, I glimpse\
  \ the lineage of a great warrior nation and understand a little better the significance\
  \ of the day.  \n\nClouds gather and we decide to head off - we\u2019ve experienced\
  \ what we came for."
