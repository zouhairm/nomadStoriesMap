Text: "Standing in the Moskovsky Rail Terminal, at 6 in the morning with my clammy\
  \ palms and swollen eyes laced with sleep, I was early for my 7:26 train. Sure,\
  \ I knew the basic dynamics of catching a train and my six weeks in St. Petersburg\
  \ had left me with enough knowledge of the Russian alphabets but in the foggy morning\
  \ of the mid July, it was still the first major hurdle of my first solo travel,\
  \ figuring out my train in the half-empty misty railway station. \nMargarita like\
  \ me was on her way to Veliky Novgorod (Veliky meaning \u2018the Great\u2019, which\
  \ I learned on the train) but to visit her \u2018Babushka\u2019 i.e. Grandma. While\
  \ she was very chatty and was happy to talk to me as it helped her practice her\
  \ English, I was happy because it was helping the clamminess subside with the passing\
  \ scenery.\nAs soon as I got out of the station I felt the chilly wind\u2019s onslaught\
  \ on my face and while it was well above 10 am, there was no sign of the sun, so\
  \ the sunset plan was definitely to be abandoned, for it was a cloudy day. Margarita\
  \ wanted to visit her Grandma before our day together and so with a cup of hot chocolate\
  \ and a \u2018pirozhki\u2019 in our hands, we both started walking towards her place,\
  \ crossing the city hall which was lined with beautiful red flowers equivalent to\
  \ a floristic decor. The serene town seemed like it was set in a different time\
  \ with small houses and shops on either side of the small glistening road. As soon\
  \ as we entered her place, I was welcomed by the familiar smell of fresh fishes\
  \ and her Grandmother whom I greeted in my limited Russian.  She was quite happy\
  \ to see me and just like any grandmother, she wanted to feed me and so she invited\
  \ me for the late lunch, which I graciously accepted. \nThe walk to the Kremlin\
  \ followed by its exploration was fun as Margarita told me about the oldest town\
  \ of Russia, nestled in the banks of the River Volkhov. But did I mention how fortunate\
  \ I was to have found her, for not only was I seeing the town through her eyes but\
  \ was also about to go on a canoe trip around the river to see me the quaint sights\
  \ of the town because she had seen me gazing longingly at the river from the rooftop\
  \ walkway of the Kremlin. This boat smelt of the morning fishes from her Grandma\u2019\
  s place which later I discovered was because of the fact her friend who owned the\
  \ boat also supplied the fishes to her folks. I did try my hands at rowing the canoe\
  \ but later on gave up on it to breathe in the sights filled with the petrichor\
  \ of the river banks dancing with the smell of the fishes. \nHaving walked all the\
  \ while, we were rather famished by the time we reached her place and as I entered,\
  \ I smelt the fragrance of cheese fused with bread and the distinct smell of smoked\
  \ fish. Her Grandma had prepared \u2018Smoked Fish Solyanka\u2019 with the white\
  \ fish from the morning and was heating up the \u2018Hachapuri\u2019, a product\
  \ of her part Georgian descent. I had never had a combination of cheese-filled bread\
  \ with thick fish soup and to say it was doing a mesmerizing tap dance on my taste\
  \ buds wouldn\u2019t be wrong. I was satiated with my gastronomical pleasure when\
  \ Margarita suggested that it would be a great idea to sit on the banks of the river\
  \ to enjoy the late evening breeze. We had just settled on the riverside when the\
  \ fat droplets of water gave away the oncoming downpour. While being drenched, I\
  \ did something that I had only seen in movies, I asked her to hold my hands in\
  \ a criss-cross fashion and go about twirling in circles to do what we Indians called\
  \ as \u2018fuljhadi\u2019 and that day while I took all that Margarita had to offer,\
  \ I left a piece of me in her as we twirled around in the rain, splashing water\
  \ and giggling like two-year-olds."
