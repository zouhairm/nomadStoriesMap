Text: "When your flight is delayed, and are sleep (and shower) deprived- you don\u2019\
  t anticipate finding your soul mate, especially when ypu discover you are worlds\
  \ apart!\nFlash backward 2016 I\u2019m just a  single girl off to visit my sister,\
  \ catch some rays, read some good books, when a chance meeting of a fleet of Royal\
  \ Navy Submariners are docked and dwelling in the same town! Most sailors are polite\
  \ and genuine, yet there is the one, that one who has his head down and appears\
  \ to want nothing to do with meeting a strange girl from NY! \nWithout hesitation\
  \ this introvert has the courage to question why this guy is the rude one if the\
  \ bunch.... and continues grilling him for hours about his job, his life story-\
  \ anything to hold his attnetion...Boy meets girl... and invites her out the next\
  \ night! Shocked and surprised with nothing to lose, I agree. \nThey say, \u201C\
  when you know- you know,\u201D and it can\u2019t be explained any more clearly than\
  \ that.\nHe knew! Dates followed and time together was limited! We both knew we\
  \ must be together! Flash forward to 2019 and 3400 moles apart, separated by one\
  \ big ocean- we have had 3 years or back and forth travels making our whirlwind\
  \ romance an reality! \nIt is never easy, but anything worth working for generally\
  \ is not gotten without diligence and devotion! It is  UK to USA love that can\u2019\
  t be defined. It is a story that keep on going!\nLove truly has no boundaries!"
