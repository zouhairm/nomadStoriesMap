Text: "When I bought the tickets to Barcelona, for me and my boyfriend, Alex, I thought\
  \ \u201Cthis will never happen, it\u2019s to good to be true, something will mess\
  \ this up\u201D because, with us, there\u2019s always some challenges and obviously\
  \ something did happen. The first obstacle was the boss of Alex decided that \u201C\
  no one will take time for vacations this month\u201D just because. I panic a little\
  \ \u2013 as usual - but that was no surprise for me and as normal we solve the problem\
  \ at our way and we were going to Barcelona! After we got into the airport, I was\
  \ shaking everywhere, it was my first time on a plain and oh boy, how afraid was\
  \ I. As I look around, everyone looked very calm or very tired, most of them were\
  \ travelling in business, it was obvious by the expression on their faces, the suitcases\
  \ and the addiction about every 3 minutes, to take a look into the watch, which\
  \ every one of them had in the left arm, as they can rush the lines or the aircraft.\
  \ Finally, everyone gets ready to flight except me, that really believed that I\
  \ was going to die in there.  \n  After an hour, we arrived at Barcelona Airport\
  \ and went until Numancia 18, Zordo\u2019s House, a friend of mine, who was living\
  \ there, which was very easy to find \u2013 as every streets and places in there,\
  \ very organized city. We had everything we needed, the subway, supermarkets, beautiful\
  \ spots to chill. It was a street where thousands of motorcycles, bikes and even\
  \ electric scooters, were waiting to be used by anyone who wanted to ride around\
  \ the city. Everyone has their own style and all the streets I crossed were the\
  \ most beauty I've ever seen, all the architecture and all the tall buildings where\
  \ each one were different on the inside, it was a bar on a corner, next to the Wax\
  \ Museum, which name was \u201CEl Bosc de les Fades\u201D where we entered and we\
  \ were speechless, it was like I was on a forest, with mushrooms and the moon, a\
  \ little waterfall and some real trees in there. I would marry there.  \n  Every\
  \ place is a place, every adventure is an adventure, this trip was no difference.\
  \ Me, Alex and Zordo were on the subway looking forward to have a nice dinner over\
  \ a hangover when some random boy shows up, touches Alex on his shoulder and start\
  \ talking some language that was not spanish, at all. Zordo start telling us to\
  \ check our pockets and to put our hands in it, so we won\u2019t be robbed because\
  \ there\u2019s a lot of pickpockets over there. Alex kept telling him \u201CI don\u2019\
  t understand you, I'm sorry\u201D and at some point \u2013 like 30 seconds later\
  \ - he left. \u201CDo you have everything with you, Alex?\u201D Zordo asked and\
  \ what a surprise, the mobile was gone. We turn around, we saw the guy and a couple\
  \ of friends and we didn\u2019t care about who they were I just thought \u201CI\u2019\
  m not gonna be robbed\u201D and we start running through gates, screaming for them\
  \ to stop while getting out of breath. Finally, we reached the streets where thousands\
  \ of people were present and everyone thought \u201COkay, we will never make it,\
  \ it\u2019s not possible\u201D and right in that moment, we reached them, we got\
  \ the phone back and 5 minutes after we were having a great meal talking about all\
  \ of this and how crazy it was.\n  Barcelona, was made for skate and skate was made\
  \ for Barcelona, MACBA and all the narrow streets, the biggest avenues, the freedom\
  \ of them there was one of the most beautiful joys for me. There, you could be everything\
  \ you wanted to and show it to the world in different ways. \n    Barcelona, it\u2019\
  s an open city for the art, for the tourists, for the locals. It was a place for\
  \ me."
