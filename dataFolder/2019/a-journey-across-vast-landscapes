Text: "Canada is one of the world\u2019s largest countries and I am so glad it is\
  \ my home. In 2016 I had the privilege of taking my first trip across the country,\
  \ from my hometown of Smiths Falls, Ontario to Kamloops, British Columbia \u2013\
  \ a 42-hour drive. This was a leap into the unknown for me because I was heading\
  \ for my last two and a half years of school at Thompson Rivers University. Our\
  \ first stop on the journey was Wawa, Ontario, where the big goose lies. We had\
  \ the most amazing pickerel at a restaurant that was right next to the highway.\
  \ We had no idea such good food could be had in Wawa, where the population is short\
  \ of 3,000. At night we stayed at a bed and breakfast called the Whiskey Jack Ridge,\
  \ which we booked on Airbnb. It was located at the end of a dirt road right off\
  \ of the highway. It was a gorgeous mansion with a water fountain right inside the\
  \ foyer. But the house was only half finished. We wanted to hear the story of the\
  \ house and how it came to be a bed and breakfast. Unfortunately, the hosts did\
  \ not disclose the entirety of the story but we imagined different scenarios. We\
  \ had the most wonderful breakfast of waffles with homemade blueberry compote. \n\
  \nThe next stop was just before Thunder Bay, at a place called Nipigon. We stayed\
  \ with a man named Murray and his wife. We had booked the accommodation once again\
  \ on Airbnb. The hosts made us the most delicious cinnamon buns; we pretty much\
  \ had them for dinner. We talked and chatted with the hosts and then played some\
  \ games. It was a wonderful, comfortable stay and we couldn\u2019t have asked for\
  \ anything better along the shores of the great Superior. \n\nFrom Nipigon we headed\
  \ to Winnipeg, which wasn\u2019t very exciting because we were on the outskirts\
  \ of the city, and had dinner at the hotel restaurant. (This was the place where\
  \ we had our bikes stolen on the way back the following trip so I don\u2019t have\
  \ very fond memories). \n\nWe took a six and a half hour drive to Moose Jaw \u2013\
  \ where their slogan is \u201CSurprisingly Unexpected\u201D. We had time to spare\
  \ when we arrived so we ventured to the underground tunnels. Moose Jaw boasts a\
  \ rich history of prohibition, bootlegging, Chinese Immigration and the railroad.\
  \ We were surprised by the tour and enthused by what the small city had to offer.\
  \ At this stop there was little food to discuss, as it was quite generic. We were\
  \ more focused on the entertainment. \n\nAfter Moose Jaw, we finally reached the\
  \ destination I had been waiting for the entire duration of the trip. Banff. Banff\
  \ is one of the most sought after destinations within Canada itself. It is an international\
  \ destination and has been one of the most built up towns in a National Park in\
  \ the world. It was overwhelming to say the least. Stores seemed to be more important\
  \ than the scenery around. Food was severely overpriced but good. I have to admit,\
  \ I was happy to be surrounded by mountains. When we continued on our journey to\
  \ the west we stopped at Lake Louise. I had wanted to go to Lake Louise since I\
  \ was a little girl, dreaming of the aqua waters and scenic mountains. First problem,\
  \ there was nowhere to park. We had to park at the very back of the upper parking\
  \ lot. This was disappointing and quite scary to be honest. I took a photo which\
  \ the lake, the mountain and the rainbow in the background and we stayed for a total\
  \ of half an hour. \n\nMy journey was certainly an unexpected one where I ate delicious\
  \ food, met wonderful people and made connections with landscapes. When we finally\
  \ drove into Kamloops I was quite happy the long drive was over and I knew that\
  \ new memories were about to be made."
