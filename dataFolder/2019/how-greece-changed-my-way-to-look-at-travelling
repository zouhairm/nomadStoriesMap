Text: "We arrived in Athens on the 4th of August. The heat was unbelievable. On our\
  \ way to the hotel, I looked out the bus window and I immediately realised that\
  \ that city was different from any other I had seen until that very moment. It was\
  \ a Friday, so the streets of the city centre were crowded with people doing their\
  \ shopping, food markets and old men sitting on their small chairs right in the\
  \ middle of the sidewalk, playing cards and shouting loud exclamations in a language\
  \ that I came to love deeply. There was nothing very different from what you can\
  \ find in the small towns surrounding my city, so we felt at home right away. It\
  \ was a strange feeling. \nOur hotel was in a neighbourhood mainly inhabited by\
  \ Arab immigrants, we found out after some explorations and a few online researches,\
  \ not far from Monastiraki, one of the central areas. I won\u2019t lie, the small\
  \ streets around our hotel didn\u2019t look very attractive. They were quite dark\
  \ and not very clean, maybe because of the numerous food and flea markets in the\
  \ area, but none of us, except for my mother, was concerned. We were happy to be\
  \ in a city that vibrated with an incredible atmosphere, very different from the\
  \ grandeur of the places we had visited in the previous years, like Paris, London\
  \ and Prague. Also, it was hilarious to see her (my mom) worrying, for an entire\
  \ day, about having chosen an \u2018inadequate\u2019 hotel for us. \nWe spent there\
  \ three days, which is enough, I think, to see almost all the touristic places,\
  \ but not to really grasp the true essence of the city. I didn\u2019t expect to\
  \ find a country so broken and beautiful at the same time, which, I know, sounds\
  \ like a terrible clich\xE9. However, that is what you will find, quite literally,\
  \ if you go to the main square, Monastiraki Square: homeless people sleeping just\
  \ \u2018below\u2019 the Pantheon, on the benches next to the Church of Pantanassa,\
  \ the 10th-century katholikon of an ancient monastery. Even though tourists invade\
  \ every single street in the city, \u2018connections\u2019 with the locals are still\
  \ possible in many ways.\nThe best memory I have of Athens is the long walk we took,\
  \ on the second day, in the Plaka, the oldest section of the city. Resembling a\
  \ small village, the Plaka is admittedly quite commercialized and touristic but\
  \ it remains one of the nicest areas in Athens.\n\nAfter three days, we embarked\
  \ upon a long four-day Odyssey on a big grey bus, during which we saw the legendary\
  \ Mycenae and Korinthos and Ar\xE1chova, a mountainous village at the foot of Mt.\
  \ Parnass\xF3s, in Viotia. Throughout this unique, but tiring trip, we were constantly\
  \ accompanied by the melodious voice of our guide, Anna, who, speaking an almost-perfect\
  \ Italian (with a very thick Greek accent though), gave us all the information stored\
  \ in her mind, both on the bus with a microphone and while we were walking uphill\
  \ with a 43-degree temperature.  \nOf all these places we\u2019ve seen, I will focus\
  \ on Ar\xE1chova, because it\u2019s the place that stole my heart on that holiday.\
  \ Usually a winter destination and a favourite for ski lovers and celebrities, the\
  \ town was almost completely empty at that time of the year and that allowed us\
  \ to enjoy in solitude the amazing landscapes, a few long walks and the Byzantine\
  \ Churches with their frescos. Sadly, we spent only one day there. Everyone had\
  \ to leave for some other destination anyway. Ours was Agistri. \n\nWe reached Agistri\
  \ on the 10th, in the late morning, after a pleasant boat trip under the hot Greek\
  \ sun. Our stay in Agistri was supposed to be the relaxing bit of our holiday and\
  \ it was indeed very relaxing, to the point that we got bored in the final two days.\
  \ Boredom is good sometimes, though. The seaside was beautiful and the sea itself\
  \ was something I never witnessed again in my life. We soon established a routine:\
  \ beach in the morning, lunch with Souvlaki, afternoon is our small cottage, sleeping\
  \ or reading, and dinner with delicious seafood. \nWhat else can be better than\
  \ this?"
