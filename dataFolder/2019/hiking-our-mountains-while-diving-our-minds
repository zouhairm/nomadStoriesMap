Text: "One more step. And another one. Followed by a not so subtle complain of my\
  \ muscles, but I managed to keep going.\nIt all started with an idea. Let`s conquer\
  \ the highest peak in our country and let`s do it this summer.\nIt may seem like\
  \ an easy task, after all, Moldoveanu, at its 2544 meters seems like a toddler in\
  \ the shadow of the biggest of them all, Everest.\nBut every journey has its milestones,\
  \ and this was ours.\nThe day was finally upon us.\nAnd it`s not like we would make\
  \ it harder on ourselves and take a long path, and a dangerous one too, right?\n\
  Wrong.\nWe did not only decide to climb the highest peak in our country, but take\
  \ a long route, too.\nIt all started at B\xE2lea Lake, in a not so warm weather\
  \ for an august morning. The wind was rushing through the people like it was racing\
  \ with the first rays of sun, not only blowing our hair, but also our minds.\nWe\
  \ stood in front of two big challenges: the cold wind and the mountain upon us.\n\
  And so, the story began.\nThe journey and its long breaks were testing both our\
  \ physical condition and minds.\nHiking seemed to be working in some sort of paradoxical\
  \ way, the more we climbed into the unkown, the more we dived into our minds.\n\
  There is one particular segment of our route I especially recall, and it may or\
  \ may not be because of its Hollywood worthy name: \u201CThree Steps from Death\u201D\
  .\nThe name had two different effects on me: both thrilled and frightened me. \n\
  We got there, and the chains, which were strong enough to hold the weight of my\
  \ thoughts were, apparently, almost not enough to carry the load of my fears. But\
  \ they did. I don`t recall holding onto something so tight as I did to those chains.\n\
  But we moved on, and so did our journey.\nThere was something about the fresh breaths\
  \ of air and the lack of them, the way that each and every person on the path was\
  \ not a stranger, but  a companion who shared the same goal: Let`s do this!\nWe\
  \ hiked through what seemed to be a capricious combination of warm sun, cold wind\
  \ and undefiable fog, but we made it to the cabin, where we stayed the night.\n\
  I vividly remember going to bed all cozy and dry in our shared tent, only to wake\
  \ up several hours later with my shirt wet. \nIt was pouring rain outside, I managed\
  \ to rip apart a bag and do some engineer voodoo thing and there I was, all set\
  \ for a dry night.\nI also made the mistake to go outside to the \u201Cbathroom\u201D\
  , in what seemed to be the darkest night sky of my life, only to hear a frightening\
  \ sound, go back to my tent in a rush, and find the following morning that last\
  \ night, the valley was visited by\u2026a bear?\nWe managed to get through that\
  \ as well, nobody got hurt, and the journey continued.\nWe hiked and hiked, hoping\
  \ and praying for a glimpse of signal in our tiny virtual world`s screen that we\
  \ totally forgot about up to now to check the weather, cause the clouds were following\
  \ us, and the fog got thicker.\nFaith was still with us and we managed to get to\
  \ the final step before conquering our goal: Moldoveanu.\nWe climbed through foggy\
  \ and windy weather and, to my surprise and arguably one of my best share of luck,\
  \ we got to the top in a brief period of time the fog banished from our eyes.\n\
  And there it was. The mountain. The valleys. The dreams and aspirations. Breathtaking\
  \ sights, literally, and the check off on our bucket list.\nAll the words I could\
  \ write will not describe the feeling of being there accurate, cause it`s so personaliezed,\
  \ I can`t guarantee I myself  would feel the same going there again.\n It was there\
  \ where I found something I didn`t think I would for a long time: peace and quiet\
  \ in my mind and pure happiness in my soul."
