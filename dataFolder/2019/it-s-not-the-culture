Text: "As I lugged my bag into the train for a 16-day trip on the Trans-Siberian Railway,\
  \ I had to remind myself that I had booked this willingly: it was safe for a woman\
  \ traveling solo; it didn\u2019t particularly cater to tourists; I wanted to immerse\
  \ myself in the culture.\n\nI stepped down the long corridor, glancing into cabins\
  \ that lined one side of the carriage like prison cells. People sprawled out on\
  \ narrow bunks, reading or sleeping or playing cards. They stared back at me as\
  \ I passed.\n\nIn cabin 9, I tucked my duffel under the bench and my face into a\
  \ friendly smile as I looked at the woman in the top bunk \u2013 older than me,\
  \ fifties, maybe, with short, coarse hair, t-shirt and shorts, and one foot propped\
  \ up on the ceiling. Stoic. Uninterested.\n\nI turned as all light was eclipsed\
  \ by a large female Russian attendant who flung a cellophane pack with sheet, pillowcase,\
  \ towel and cover on my bunk before moving on. Underneath those were paper slippers,\
  \ a toothbrush and a tube of toothpaste thinner than my pinkie.\n\nAn hour later,\
  \ another attendant came by and shouted \u201CChicken! Meat!\u201D in my face. When\
  \ I ventured \u201CChicken?\u201D she barked \u201CFore!\u201D in response, which\
  \ turned out to be the time I was to receive my meal \u2013 a TV dinner of glutinous\
  \ rice, grey meat, and sawdust in the shape of a bun.\n\nThere was one toilet stall\
  \ per 36-bunk carriage, seemingly lidless until I realized it was securely fastened\
  \ in the up position. I wrenched it free with some difficulty, requiring a vigorous\
  \ hand washing and liberal use of my tube of Polysporin. The toilet paper was industrial-grey\
  \ one-ply, the water unpotable and cold.\n\nLights were shut off early and the solid\
  \ metal cabin door clanged shut. The train\u2019s rocking was forceful but sleep\
  \ came quickly. Another roommate who had been assigned to us during the afternoon\
  \ was woken in the middle of the night, and never seen again.\n\nBut the next morning,\
  \ two new arrivals came in and we introduced ourselves with chest pointing and loudly\
  \ proclaimed names. Lidia and Natalya were smiley, with an impressive determination\
  \ to chat even though we had no language in common. Natalya was missing an eye.\
  \ I didn\u2019t notice at first since her hair covered that side of her face. Maria\
  \ came down from the top bunk to join us.\n\nThe three of them pulled out Ziploc\
  \ bags of food that they urged on me. We had a picnic, wedged hip-to-hip around\
  \ our little table where they fed me tea, and cheese, meat and cucumber sandwiches\
  \ on dense black bread, followed by dry sprigs of arugula and cilantro that we munched\
  \ like goats. Dessert was some of those wafer cookies, dry as paper, like my mom\
  \ used to hand out at Halloween. They adamantly refused my box of chocolates. I\
  \ had guest status being the sole foreigner.\n\nFrom the great confusing chat that\
  \ followed, I gathered Natalya and Lidia were a mother and daughter-in-law from\
  \ Kazakhstan. Maria was from the Ukraine. They had various kids of indeterminate\
  \ age and sex. There was only so much miming can convey, after all. A little Russian\
  \ kid ran up and down the corridor squeaking and beeping like a reversing truck.\
  \ He tripped and fell on his face in front of our cabin so repeatedly that we stopped\
  \ looking up. \n\nI made my way to the dining car where I traded funny travel stories\
  \ with an amiable Australian couple while Whitney Houston\u2019s \"I Will Always\
  \ Love You\" played on a loop. But I found myself rushing back to my roomies where\
  \ we flipped through the photos on each other\u2019s phones and learned about families\
  \ and home. We wanted more so I finally opened a translation app. Natalya asked\
  \ me why I travel. I earnestly said that I liked to experience different cultures.\
  \ She smiled and typed, \u201CNo, Mary, it\u2019s not the culture, it\u2019s the\
  \ people.\u201D Lidia and Maria nodded. I smiled back at them. Maybe it wasn\u2019\
  t hard time after all."
