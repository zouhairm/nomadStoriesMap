Text: "If you ask me how to cook a mouth-watering chicken with some creamy sauce flavored\
  \ with garlic and Italian herbs, I will definitely tell you my super-secret recipe.\
  \ But in this case, I am not sure if you can cook it absolutely the same way. You\
  \ know, people sometimes try not to lavish the competitor\u2019s side. Well, the\
  \ story is not going to be sticky sour dipped in vanilla and chocolate until we\
  \ come to the Italian spirits.\nOnce being in Italy my husband and I decided to\
  \ book in advance a train ticket to Lake Como. The ticket should have been validated\
  \ the next day before getting into the train. All seemed simple. We suddenly came\
  \ to the railway station one hour before the trip and decided to start out a journey\
  \ exactly that moment \u2013 3 minutes before the train leaving.\nWell, it was a\
  \ once-in-a-lifetime opportunity when you woke up in time, drank a cup of coffee,\
  \ and with the help of magic appeared on train platform scrolling all sophisticated\
  \ options in your still sleepy head, decided to rush into a carriage which might\
  \ have gone in 30 seconds. Do you know the feeling of going to be a date night?\
  \ The same feeling we had inside \u2013  the happy survivors of morning adventure\
  \ that was going to start immediately. Ready, steady\u2026 stop\u2026 What about\
  \ that ticket that should have been validated before boarding? And if you are still\
  \ thinking about that damn chicken, it is time to start sympathizing with my poor\
  \ knowledge of Italian.\nScuzi signora, I need some help. Do you speak English?\n\
  No, parlo l\u2019italiano solo.\n(while I am smiling so much trying to catch dribs\
  \ and drabs of Italian in my memory)\nHai bisogno di aiuto? (At least it seemed\
  \ to be what I heard)\nSi, aiuto (the gambling of my brain which is trying to portray\
  \ that the knowledge is power). Showing the ticket that signora and suddenly discovering\
  \ the parola d\u2019ordine \u201Cvalidare\u201D, which sounds almost the same with\
  \ English one.\nHo un problema, validare all'esterno, banchina (which meant \u201C\
  I have a problem with validation of my ticket\u201D trying to speak my childish\
  \ Italian).\nThis is the right moment to make a slip in speaking about intercultural\
  \ communication: you never know what will be right or wrong.\nThat signora smiled\
  \ a lot to me and said that she would solve my problem while I was going to stop\
  \ the train and leave it. Guess what? She left her bag on the soft sit, said something\
  \ to Italians who were sitting near, and disappeared in the middle of nowhere. I\
  \ felt something like I needed to disappear too, but she came with a conductor,\
  \ who gave a quick look at us, saying \u201CAh, questo sei tu\u201D. He checked\
  \ everything and passed out of sight.\nI look at that signora again. \u201CScuzi,\
  \ non parlo l\u2019taliano ma grazie mille per l\u2019aiuto\u201D. In such cases\
  \ I always have a deep desire to talk, to ask where a person is from, what they\
  \ like and, what is more, to give a hug. \nMaking a local connection is the only\
  \ chance to hear and be heard, to understand and be understood, be clear and get\
  \ obvious responses. This is what is called \u201Cintercultural communication\u201D\
  \ in action. Adding every new ingredient to your travel adventure, you become a\
  \ mad \u201Cfoodie\u201D, who would like to have a humble dinner with natives rather\
  \ than staying in your cozy flat with dreams that will go out the window right after\
  \ your bountiful dinner is finished. And chicken? Chicken is the right instrument\
  \ to diversify a conversation if you aren\u2019t aware of what to start with.\n\
  P. S. My Italian isn\u2019t ideal so I left everything as it was said."
