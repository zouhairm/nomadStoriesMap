Text: "Lisbon is an old city, but it is still evolving. That's a romantic way of saying\
  \ there's a lot of scaffolding or, at least, there was when I visited in 2011. The\
  \ weekend I spent there, Portugal was in the midst of a economic bailout, foreign\
  \ bank cards weren't being accepted at any ATMs and the steep, cobbled streets were\
  \ littered with half-completed construction projects. Which is how my then-boyfriend\
  \ and I came to be trapped in a crowd traipsing slowly past a scaffolded church\
  \ when I felt an ominous presence, too close for comfort even on that claustrophobic\
  \ footpath, near my handbag.\n\nReflexively, I clutched the bag to my hip. It felt\
  \ different. Lighter. Where was my phone? Out of the corner of my eye, I saw him\
  \ \u2013 a shifty looking gentleman skulking past, anxiously beginning to fight\
  \ his way through the crowd when he caught me looking at him. \u201CMy phone\u201D\
  , I yelled \u2013 the first and only time to date that I have ever yelled in public\
  \ - \u201Cthat man just stole my phone!\u201D\n\nBarely missing a beat, my boyfriend\
  \ clocked the suspect and began to chase him. But he wasn't alone. Like a tightly\
  \ choreographed scene in a musical, what felt like hundreds (but was more realistically\
  \ about 15) strapping young men materialised from the crowd, wildly gesticulating\
  \ and shouting at me in Portuguese. \u201CThat way!\u201D I pointed. As they ran\
  \ off, I quickly checked my phone in case my boyfriend was trying to find his way\
  \ back to me. Wait a minute. My phone!\n\nI dashed after the men. No sign of my\
  \ boyfriend or the wrongfully accused, but I met my merry band of avengers at the\
  \ bottom of the street. \u201CPolicia! Policia!\u201D They pointed to a building\
  \ with a beautifully tiled courtyard and the kind of indoor-outdoor flow that perfectly\
  \ suits a temperate climate, but isn't so great when you're trying to run away from\
  \ a gang of vigilantes and think you're slipping into a side street but actually\
  \ end up in an open-plan police station.\n\nMy boyfriend was trying to explain the\
  \ situation to two policemen \u2013 'do you speak French? I speak French\u201D,\
  \ one asked proudly \u2013 when I interrupted in English to admit my terrible mistake.\
  \ Not so terrible, in fact. I may not have been a victim of theft, but I was a victim\
  \ of what in more recent years would come to be known as \u201Cupskirting\u201D\
  \ - the act of surreptitiously taking pictures of a lady's... Well, you can probably\
  \ guess. As more police yelled at the culprit while he shame-facedly deleted the\
  \ offending photos, our Francophone turned to us gravely. \u201CI am so sorry you\
  \ have experienced this in Lisbon. We are a friendly city, this is not usual\u201D\
  . We didn't doubt him \u2013 our mob of defenders was testament to the city's friendliness.\
  \ \u201CNow. We will give him a fright before letting him go. You should leave first\u201D\
  .\n\nWe ran all the way to the ocean."
