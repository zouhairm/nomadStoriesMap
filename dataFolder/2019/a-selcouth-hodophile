  Have you ever seen a girl with a strange feelings? If yes, have you ever wonder\
  \ how much can she  have struggle to understand her own self?\nWell, let me just\
  \ narrate you a story of a girl who wasn't born to be a homegirl.\nA girl who has\
  \ always chosen  to be serendipity, A girl who was born phub , A girl who thought\
  \ of being a gadabout because she thought that's the way she could understand herself\
  \ better!\nLife starts when you understand yourself in a better way, because that's\
  \ the exact point when you stop giving a damn about people and their mentality!\n\
  Well there are many ways of understanding yourself and travelling is one of them!\n\
  As a child whenever this girl ( let's just assume that her name is Ash) so, yeah\
  \ as a child whenever Ash used to be frustrated she used to lock herself in a room\
  \ , switch the lights off and use to think that the world is really cruel, and she\
  \ thought being rude is the only way to be yourself .\nAsh never interfered anybody's\
  \ life, though she was just  six years old she really used to imagine hell lot of\
  \ things, and that's when she started being introvert .\nOne fine day Ash's mom\
  \ scolded her and told her to get out of the house for some reason  , frustrated\
  \ Ash left her home without informing anyone , she alone went for a walk on the\
  \ beach side and saw many beautiful smiling faces,\nShe had completely forgotten\
  \ the her home, A home where she had spent 6 long years, she met a foreigner and\
  \ they had good time together playing and singing rhymes !  After some time her\
  \ dad reacged that spot and took her home, seeing her Dad's worried face and tears\
  \ in his eyes she realised  her parents love for her.\nShe couldn't sleep that night\
  \ , hell lot of thoughts were running in her mind It was then she realised that\
  \ life is too short and world is too wide! \nAnd Ash is none other than myself who\
  \ then decided that to know herself in a better way she have to travel because when\
  \ we travel we find inner peace and trouvaille .\nWell i just thought of narrating\
  \ my past because it was that day when i realised how important it is to travel,\
  \ i still can recollect that foreigners face and still miss him sometimes, now that\
  \ i have grown up i try travelling to different places to forget the alexithym ,\
  \ life has been very strange to me but I try my best to be kind and keep smiling\
  \ . \nDust on my shoes settle but I can't.\nI feel as if I am agelast if I don't\
  \ travel for short period of time.\nTraveling has changed many things in me..\n\
  As a child I didn't have much friends, but now i have friends in different countries.\n\
  Travelling has changed me from agelast to gigglemug!\nFrom innocent rude girl to\
  \ a naughty kind girl!\nFrom nictophilia to pluviophile and heliophile!\nFrom an\
  \ introvert to an ambivert.\nI took me a long time to change myself,\nI won't call\
  \ it as changing myself ,I would rather call it updating myself.\nTravelling has\
  \ served the purpose of  mentonia in my life.\nMost of the times i meet people and\
  \ absquatulate just as the foreigner did,\nSo that people miss my smile as I miss\
  \ of his! I still travel alone sometimes to know the worth of the place , to know\
  \ the worth of their culture , food etc etc..\nWell this is my short story related\
  \ to travelling.\nI've just started being a wanderlust there is lot more to be discovered\
  \ .\nAs I said earlier life is too short and world is too wide. I just wanna make\
  \ the best use of my life, I don't require name and fame as most of people do, I\
  \ just wanna die peacefully with no regrets in my life , cause money returns but\
  \ time doesn't (my dad says it!) he is a traveller too ! But now he have sacrificed\
  \ hell lo So that is it!"
