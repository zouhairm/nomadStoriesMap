Text: "We\u2019re entering one of the few territories that still uses a hammer and\
  \ sickle on its flag. Canada warns against all travel to Transnistria, the autonomous\
  \ unit wedged between Moldova and Ukraine. Last year, an aspiring war photographer\
  \ cautioned me that he took a picture near the Lenin statue in Tiraspol and six\
  \ KGB officers materialized. They interrogated him and confiscated his film.\n \n\
  The choppy night train from Cluj-Napoca, Romania, leaves us bleary eyed, we are\
  \ finally in Ia\u0219i. Two grizzled Romanian guys in our train compartment chatted\
  \ all night over coke and homemade alcohol called P\u0103linc\u0103. By the time\
  \ we walk off the shape of the train chairs, we make our way to hitchhike to the\
  \ Black Sea in Odessa, Ukraine.\n \nThe sparse outskirts of Ia\u0219i are like all\
  \ the Romanian towns I\u2019ve seen. There are distant haystacks resembling obese\
  \ wookies, sprawling vineyards, and electrical wires dangling from buildings like\
  \ soggy spaghetti. We pass old farmhouses, small creeks, barking dogs, Roma encampments.\
  \ We trudge uphill and downhill. Finally, the elusive spot. \u201CHow can we hitchhike\
  \ as five?\u201D Melanie asks. \u201CLet\u2019s divide ourselves up, first team\
  \ to Chisinau wins!\u201D I dare. Little did we know only three of us would even\
  \ make it to Chisinau.    \n \nMelanie, Debbie and I score the first ride, we jump\
  \ in boisterously; we\u2019re winning already! Our driver is going a couple of villages\
  \ down. I watch through the back window, the rolling hills of the valley leave crimped\
  \ cutouts of the blue sky. Before we barely start walking again, Gil and Sara drive\
  \ by sticking their tongues out at us. Their driver pulls up. We squeeze into their\
  \ lucky car going near Ungheni, a Moldovan town bordering Romania.  \n\n\u201CPassports?\u201D\
  \ The border guard eyes us as he takes the stack. Another guard gives us bad news,\
  \ Debbie\u2019s Greek ID card is insufficient. She is escorted back across the inter-zone.\
  \ Out of solidarity, Melanie joins her. In Ungheni, it\u2019s just the three of\
  \ us; the only foul play is EU bureaucracy. Our travelling bard, Sara, writes a\
  \ new line for our song about the trip, taking on the color of tragedy. We follow\
  \ the decrepit train tracks toward the exit road. \n\n\u201CGil, your hair is the\
  \ longest, put it down, pop out your hip and turn your back!\u201D Sara jokes. Drivers\
  \ will think we\u2019re three women again. We still get stuck in a village not far\
  \ away. Darkness is dampening the torch of day and we have no idea where we are.\
  \ We have to turn down a ride of five purple-nosed drunk men who presumably want\
  \ us to sit on their laps. \u201CWe could pitch the tent on top of that abandoned\
  \ barn over there!\u201D I\u2019m trying to comfort myself. \n\nThere is a gaggle\
  \ outside the local shop who keep peering at us and laughing while cars leave us\
  \ in the dust. Eventually someone tells us to take the bus to Chisinau. We gesticulate\
  \ that we don\u2019t have Moldovan money yet. A woman finally offers to drive us\
  \ back to Ungheni to find a hotel. \u201CWhere are you from?\u201D She asks. \u201C\
  Canada, France and Spain!\u201D We respond in unison. Christina, our driver lights\
  \ up. Her son wants to study in Western Europe. She invites us to sleep at her house.\
  \ \n \nWe make crepes for Christina\u2019s family, her stoic husband heavily encouraging\
  \ us to drink. He smirks at our sour faces when we drink p\u0103linc\u0103 as he\
  \ does: straight. We feast on roast chicken, ambrosia salad, pickles, local cheeses,\
  \ and homemade wine. The decor reminds me of the Doukhobor refugee families I grew\
  \ up surrounded by in a village in Western Canada: trinkets in every nook, horse\
  \ related paintings, dramatic wallpapers, and fake flower bouquets. After having\
  \ been away from Canada for two years, I didn\u2019t expect to feel so at home in\
  \ Ungheni, let alone be in a place called Ungheni.\n \nOn our way back, with a syrupy\
  \ song to regale to Melanie and Debbie, we pass through Tiraspol. The sign with\
  \ the hammer and sickle is in Cyrillic, I assume it is the \u201Cwelcome sign\u201D\
  , but I already know it will be a friendly place."
