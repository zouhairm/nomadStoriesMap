Text: "The travel story, that i am going to write about, is dated, in the mid summer\
  \ of 2017. \nThe travel story, is related, to my first trip, as a lonely traveller.\n\
  In the fall of 2016, i had discovered, through the internet, three new words : budget\
  \  and lonely traveller.\nAs a curious mind, i had start wondering, how it looks\
  \ like, for a person, to travel alone, in a non familiar place,\nfar from his own\
  \ home and homeland.\nMy curiosity won, mainly, because i had not any prior experience\
  \ as a lonely traveller.\nSo, I had chosen to travel, as a lonely traveller, in\
  \ a european destination.\nMy personal choice, was to travel, in London. \nIt may\
  \ sound strange, though, that i had chosen to travel, in a mainland city, such as\
  \ London, in the mid of summer.\nMainly, my choice, was influenced, by the facts,\
  \ that:\n(1) i had planned my trip and proceed to the necessary reservations, for\
  \ travel and accommodation, near the summer season/period.\n(2) the travel and accommodation\
  \ expenses were cheaper, in comparison, to other european destinations, for the\
  \ summer,\n     such as Amsterdam and Barcelona.\n(3) I was living already, in a\
  \ mainland town. For these particular reason, i believe, it was easier for me, to\
  \ adopt, in a city life.\nI had prepared myself as best as possible.\nMy travel\
  \ date arrives and my trip began.\nFrom the Larnaka International airport, to the\
  \ London Luton airport, \nfrom there, with train, to the London Blackfriars rail\
  \ station,\nand from there, with tude(underground train), to the London Waterloo\
  \ rail station.\nA few minutes walk from there, my accommodation was waiting/located.\n\
  I had locate my accommodation place and i had unpack my staff.\nIt was morning,\
  \ little after 11:00 a.m.. \nI had acquired, a rail and tube map of the city of\
  \ London.\nI had chosen to have a walk in the central London.\nI had walked to the\
  \ London Waterloo rail station.\nThere, a young stranger, had approached me, \n\
  asking if i spare some coins, in order for him, to purchase a tube train, for the\
  \ Camden town.\nI had answered negatively.\nI had chosen to visit three places.\n\
  The London national gallery, the oxford street and the OXO tower.\nUpon arrival,\
  \ in the London national gallery, the one thing, that had impressed me, was the\
  \ forecourt of the gallery.\nUpon visiting the London national gallery, i have notice\
  \ the large collection of nude art.\nThis had come in surprise. I was not expecting,\
  \ to see, in a publicly accessed gallery, nude art portraits.\nI like to see and\
  \ assume, in the same time, that in the western europe, people feel comfortable,\
  \ with the idea and the feeling of the nude art.\nFollowing my visit in the London\
  \ national gallery, I had chosen to visit the OXO tower.\nThere i came across, an\
  \ african artist. This artist was holding a very large cane and was performing something\
  \ like a dance/rite. \nThe time that i was facing him, he was looking strange at\
  \ me. Also near him was, a couple from africa. They also, were looking strange at\
  \ me.\nI guess, this was a strange meeting/situation, for all, four of as. In fact,\
  \ every time, that i am thinking about it, i am laughing. \nSomething, that had\
  \ impress me, about the OXO tower, was that, it was near the coastal line of river\
  \ thames.\nAt the particular time, that i was visiting OXO tower, an artist, was\
  \ creating in the sand, the portrait, of a character on the simpsons tv show.\n\
  In the end of my visit in OXO tower, i had noticed, that the african couple, that\
  \ i had previously met, was walking, behind me.\nIt was already afternoon, so i\
  \ had chosen, to pass the rest of the day, visiting the oxford street shops.\nIn\
  \ the sunset, i had chosen to return, in my accommodation. \nEntering the tube station,\
  \ a strange incident, had pulled my attention.\nI had noticed near me, the african\
  \ couple, that i had met, in the middle of the day, in OXO tower.\nThey were looking\
  \ at me.I thought <<strange people, strange coincidence>>."
