Text: "On our final day in Tbilisi, my travel companion and I decided to see if we\
  \ could rent a car for the day, and explore the Georgian countryside. By now we\
  \ had drunk enough Georgian wine that we felt the need to visit the famous wineries\
  \ that produced it, as well as having heard that the Georgian countryside was dotted\
  \ with gems incomparable to what one could see in Tbilisi. Upon enquiring at our\
  \ hotel about renting a car, we found that we could get a car and a driver for the\
  \ day for only a slightly larger fee than a car alone. \nOur driver's name was Georgi,\
  \ he was a gruff old man with a straight face, who barely spoke a word of English.\
  \ At first our drive was a quiet one. One of the staff members at the hotel had\
  \ explained to Georgi that my companion and I were hoping to visit one of the famous\
  \ Georgian wineries, as well as see some of the hillside monasteries that we had\
  \ been told about. Our first stop was at Bodbe Monestary, hidden down a series of\
  \ winding roads, it would have been almost impossible to find had we been driving\
  \ ourselves. We walked around the monastery for about an hour. Most of the grounds\
  \ are open for people to wander around, so we took our time wandering from the church\
  \ hall, to the gardens, to just admiring the view of the untouched hills rolling\
  \ away into the distance. \nFrom the monastery Georgi drove us to a small town to\
  \ stop and get gas. In this town we went into a corner store to grab a snack for\
  \ the road, and were introduced to the shop\u2019s owner, a man who spoke fluent\
  \ english and was a close friend of Georgi\u2019s. He gave my companion and I a\
  \ sample of his homemade Chacha, a very strong Georgian brandy. As he was a friend\
  \ of Georgi\u2019s we bought a bottle each, as well as a packet of cigarettes for\
  \ Georgi.\nAfter this stop, Georgi was much more lively. Although he spoke little\
  \ English, and we spoke no Georgian, we communicated through hand gestures, and\
  \ the tones of our voices. \u201CWine!\u201D, Georgi said, and made a drinking gesture.\
  \ We knew that our next destination would be one of Georgia\u2019s famous wineries,\
  \ and Georgi took us to the the famous Khareba winery. Khareba winery is famous,\
  \ not only for their amazing wines, produced both in wooden barrels and the traditional\
  \ Georgian way, in clay pots, but also for their tunnel cellar. We decided to take\
  \ a tour of the cellar, paying for a ticket that allowed us to do a private wine\
  \ tasting, as well as get a guided tour of the cellar and the history behind it.\
  \ We also stopped for a very late lunch at the winery\u2019s caf\xE9, and got to\
  \ soak in the serenity of the Georgian countryside. \nAfter the winery, Georgi indicated\
  \ that we would return to Tbilisi. We were quite surprised to be returning so soon,\
  \ but shortly after we began driving, we realized that we would be taking the scenic\
  \ route back. We drove through town after town, stopping when Georgi wanted to show\
  \ us a fortress, or statue. At one point we stopped on the roadside and Georgi bought\
  \ us peaches from a street vendor. Almost three hours later, we arrived back in\
  \ Tbilisi, very tired, but also content that we had seen a side of Georgia that\
  \ would not have been possibly on our own. Not only did we had the opportunity to\
  \ explore the gorgeous Georgian countryside, but we also made a wonderful new friend.\
  \ Georgi, thank you for letting us see your country through your eyes. I hope that\
  \ life is treating you well, and that we might meet again some day."
