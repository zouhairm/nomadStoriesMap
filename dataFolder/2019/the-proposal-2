Text: "I met Kamilla online, and like many online connections that we make in this\
  \ digital age, somehow instant chemistry was born. At the time, I was living and\
  \ working in a small modern city in Arabia called Dubai, and Kamilla was studying\
  \ for her Master's degree in the sweet Baltic city of Riga. Worlds apart, yet whenever\
  \ I was off work and she was pretending she didn't have anything better to do, we'd\
  \ be together on Skype. Sometimes just sharing silence with a smile, and sometimes\
  \ talking about all the things no one else could understand. \n\nFinally, by then\
  \ end of 2017, we decided to spend our Christmas break together. I remember our\
  \ first meeting like it was yesterday. Light rain was falling gently on my face\
  \ when I saw her on the other side of the road walking towards me. She was different\
  \ in every way, yet familiar from all aspects. The chemistry was now evolving, shaping\
  \ new boundaries and taking new form to define us in the process. Riga was the perfect\
  \ place to make it all happen; calm and medieval with just the right amount of modern.\
  \ We probably walked a step for every word we had ever spoken, and with every other\
  \ step came a laugh and a beautiful moment. \n\nThe frequent showers made every\
  \ little walk a small adventure. The romantic streets made being lost feel so comfortable.\
  \ The warm Christmas vibes gave life to every corner. Everything at the time felt\
  \ like it was working to help us realize the obvious. Then, on new year's eve, for\
  \ the first time ever in my life, I saw a snow flake. The perfect symmetry gave\
  \ me a feeling beyond any possible description. I was in awe, lost in that symmetry,\
  \ feeling as if we were both part of it sitting oppositley. That's when the perfect\
  \ flake melted on my finger, and it's structure became one in a beautiful tiny droplet.\
  \ \n\nI asked Kamilla to marry me that day. After she said yes, I asked for her\
  \ father's number so that I may call and introduce myself, which is the usual custom\
  \ for Muslims. Her reaction was unexpected; a slightly hysteric laugh which I didn't\
  \ quite understand at first. Her reply was \"How?\". It was a bit confusing for\
  \ me until she explained that no one in her family speaks English or Arabic. You\
  \ see, I'm from Egypt, and Kamilla's family can only speak Russian and Uzbek. That\
  \ basically meant that Google Translate was going to narrate the most important\
  \ meeting of my life, but that's a different story."
