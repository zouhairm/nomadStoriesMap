Text: "\u201CHey, erm, I was thinking\u2026 Would you like to join me on the volunteering\
  \ project that my university is organizing?\u201D \u2013 my Chilean friend Vicente\
  \ asked me on the phone, uneasily pausing between words. The invitation was unexpected\
  \ and I gasped. \n\nIn the recent years Chile managed to help its regions jump from\
  \ \u201Cextreme poverty\u201D band into \u201Cpoverty\u201D which on its own is\
  \ a marker of progression, but also means there is still a lot of work to do. As\
  \ a contribution to the social development of the country every year the School\
  \ of Engineering of Pontificia Universidad Catolica de Chile organizes the so-called\
  \ Winter Works. During a 10-day project students of the school go to regions of\
  \ Chile particularly affected by poverty and help local families by constructing\
  \ small sheds or anything of that sort that families ask for. \n\nAt the time of\
  \ the invitation to join the project I was flipping through my guidebook and various\
  \ travel websites, scanning for information on how to reach Mapuche communities\
  \ in Chile. Mapuche is an indigenous ethnicity, inhabiting south-central Chile and\
  \ southwestern Argentina, and I was very captivated by the idea of meeting them.\
  \ As many other indigenous communities, Mapuche were long oppressed by Spanish colonialists,\
  \ then Pinochet, and are still struggling for their right to be who they are today.\
  \ Unfortunately, I was limited either by time or transport and I did not know anyone\
  \ who could introduce me to Mapuche. Upset, I gave up on the idea. Nothing, however,\
  \ was preventing me from joining the university project and getting to know the\
  \ not so touristy side of Chile. \n\nWe were a big group of 70 people and arrived\
  \ in a village 1 hour away from a city Contulmo in 3 buses. We brought all sorts\
  \ of construction materials and tools with us, such as wooden planks, metal sheets\
  \ and piles and others, the terms for which I don\u2019t even know. The huge bunch\
  \ of people that we were was divided into smaller groups of 6-7 people, each assigned\
  \ to an individual family. My group was assigned to Carolina and her 2 children,\
  \ Alexis and Rossio. While we were working, Carolina would cook for us a cazuela,\
  \ traditional Chilean soup, and give us some manjar, boiled condensed milk, as dessert.\
  \ Her 8-year old daughter Rossio was eager to communicate with us, but I couldn\u2019\
  t understand a word of what she was saying. \u201CDon\u2019t worry, it\u2019s not\
  \ your Spanish that fails you \u2013 laughed Vicente. \u2013 I don\u2019t understand\
  \ her either, and that\u2019s because she speaks Mapuche, not Spanish.\u201D\n\n\
  Miraculously, I was having lunches with a Mapuche family, even though by this time\
  \ I forgot about my desire to meet the indigenous ethnicity. \n\nCarolina asked\
  \ us to build her a chicken house. The family has a big number of chickens but lives\
  \ right next to the forest. Chickens, who are the main source of food for Carolina\
  \ and her 2 children, run free in the the poorly fenced area, and wild foxes from\
  \ the forest regularly pop into the territory for a free buffet. A chicken house\
  \ is a relatively simple thing to construct, but would make a huge improvement to\
  \ the life of little Alexis and Rossio. \n\nDuring lunch Carolina would tell us\
  \ about how she doesn\u2019t speak Mapuche because she grew up during years of especially\
  \ violent oppression of their culture. Alexis and Rossio, however, have the opportunity\
  \ to learn their language and culture in school and can talk to their grandparents\
  \ in Mapuche without fear. Carolina was very excited when she learned that, in fact,\
  \ I was not from Chile but from Russia, and started asking me all sorts of questions.\
  \ Was it ever hot? Do we eat cazuela? I told her about borsch and how Russian people\
  \ also love boiled condensed milk \u2013 which is what manjar is. This little unexpected\
  \ cultural connection made her smile even wider.\n\nShe then brought out a traditional\
  \ Mapuche headdress, composed of multiple coins and colourful ribbons, and proudly\
  \ put it on my head. I was shy but felt flattered, as Carolina was fixing the garment\
  \ and excitingly evaluating how it looked with my face."
