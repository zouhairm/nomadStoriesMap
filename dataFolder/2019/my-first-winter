Text: "\"You can't live at all, unless you can live fully now.\" - Alan Watts\n\n\
  It's hard to say what really made me do it - whether it was the daily grind of going\
  \ in and out of work, the horrendous traffic situation or re-discovering my high\
  \ school journal filled with cities that I have yet to go to. Maybe it's all of\
  \ those. Whatever it is, I decided to pack my bags, leave everything I have ever\
  \ known, everything familiar, to study overseas, in London. \n\nIt definitely was\
  \ a leap into the unknown. My husband and I have no family here which is highly\
  \ unlikely and unnerving for us Asians who grow up surrounded by close-knit communities,\
  \ we absolutely have no idea if we will ever get a job, there's the Brexit situation,\
  \ and we did not have a place to stay.  \n\nI remember the very first day we arrived.\
  \ We got off the underground tube station to walk to the apartment of our friend\
  \ who was gracious enough to let us stay while she was on vacation. It was Sunday\
  \ morning, 6:15 am. The sun just started to rise, leaving light and shadows in its\
  \ trail. The fallen leaves were crushed under my feet as I walked through Russell\
  \ Square. The city was just waking up and there is really something magical about\
  \ a city on the verge of waking up. It gives you a sense of hope, of redemption.\
  \ It was peacefully quiet and I took it all in. \n\nFast forward to 5 months later.\
  \ I am now sitting on our canvas sofa in our 2-bedroom flat in Central London, smacked\
  \ between three large train stations: Euston, King's Cross and St. Pancras. It's\
  \ also a 15-20 minute walk to 2 museums, the British Library and the famous Camden\
  \ food market. It has happened. I have left the unknown and the unknown has embraced\
  \ me. \n\nIt was not easy and I doubt it will be smooth sailing from here. But the\
  \ memories. Oh, the memories are worth doing it all over again for. Our very first\
  \ winter, our very first experience of snowfall, my running after the bus so I will\
  \ not be late, going to a centuries old food market, orange Jaffa cakes, the Christmas\
  \ lights walk and so much more.\n\nAlan Wats was right. You are not really living\
  \ unless you are living fully. Sometimes, when something is too familiar and comfortable,\
  \ we start to stop living. We grow complacent, aimless and we take beautiful moments\
  \ for granted. Leaping into the unknown could revive that dying soul, that fading\
  \ life. My decision to move to London definitely did. It was frightening and quite\
  \ nerve-racking but there are no guarantees in life anyway. Unexpected things happen\
  \ that pull the rugs beneath our feet. It really just a matter of deciding which\
  \ risks to take because no matter how difficult it could be, living fully even with\
  \ pain, disappointments and storms, always outweigh living just to exist."
