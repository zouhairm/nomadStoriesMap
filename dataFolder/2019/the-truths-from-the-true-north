Text: "Stereotypes most of the time are just prejudiced and only show a part of the\
  \ whole content. However, when we talk about Canada all those stereotypes are true.\
  \ I did not except to find a perfect representation from my high school dreamed,\
  \ but in fact, I did.\nCanadian people are exactly as I heard, polite, friendly\
  \ and great host. When I needed to ask a simple direction to the restroom instead\
  \ to show me the way they took my hand and walk with me until there. If the words\
  \ were too difficult to understand, they would explain me twice, if necessarily\
  \ they would mime it. Not to mention their ability to make you feel at home, making\
  \ you feel comfortable miles away from your hometown. An example of that are the\
  \ refugees from all over the global who chose Canada their new home. At a visit\
  \ to the Museum of Human Rights, I discovered the reason why, they are ashamed from\
  \ the past bad acts, they try to redeem themselves for saying no to Jewish boats\
  \ that asked for help during the Holocaust. They appreciate the Aboriginal culture,\
  \ because they know how important they were to the country, different from Brazil\
  \ they care about their origin and they had especial days and celebration to this\
  \ people.\nWhile doing my third year of high school there I could see their concern\
  \ with the adolescents, who were going to start their own lives. The students could\
  \ choose subjects that calls their attention and are focus on their future choices.\
  \ The schools had proficient people to lead the students to the best journey. They\
  \ also were there to simply listen to them and help or conduct to a help. Schools\
  \ also had projects and clubs to instigate and encourage the best from the students,\
  \ giving them plenty of opportunities. Furthermore, they had assistance to find\
  \ a job, which does not disturb their studies. Yet, my favorite part of the high\
  \ school was the volunteer work. Actions directed from kids as Teddy Bear Camping\
  \ until adult with the Salem Mission \u2013 organization that cooked the tree meaningful\
  \ meals for the homeless people.\nAgain, Canadian people are surprisingly spectacular,\
  \ their culture, routine and way of living life are definitively worth it. The country\
  \ beauties are the best ones. In case you are thinking about a tourism trip or studies\
  \ trip, you must think about The True North. You will not regret since Canada is\
  \ beyond any doubt an amazing country."
