Text: "It was a cold winter saturday in Friburg, Switzerland, yet not cold enough\
  \ to be snowing. Me and my family decided to take the car and drive to nearby cities,\
  \ determined to find some snow. We had seen it before, but even if it wasn\u2019\
  t anything new, we were still travelers from a tropical country where the sun burned\
  \ bright and warm all year. The shiny white snow, freezing and untouched, still\
  \ had the magic feeling of foreign movies and childhood books. \n\nAfter a particularly\
  \ hard year, the trip to Europe had been an unexpected blessing, the plane tickets\
  \ bought only a month before the scheduled flying date. There was no time to prepare,\
  \ no time to come up with a detailed travel plan. The lack of plans was entirily\
  \ out of my comfort zone, but it was only fitting to my current mind state: my hopes\
  \ were low, and I had learned to settle for small things. \n\nAs we got to the small\
  \ village of Schwarzsee, I could see the long white carpet covering the base of\
  \ the mountains. \u201CThis is enough\u201D, I thought as we aproached, imagining\
  \ that was all the snow we were going to get. After all, the weather forecast showed\
  \ nothing but cold rain on our surroundings, and me and my family were known for\
  \ driving the cold away, according to past experiences. \n\nEven so, we decided\
  \ to take the car a bit higher to see the city lake, now a grey frozen area covering\
  \ a huge part of the view. Even if it looked like it would be a beautiful sight\
  \ on a sunny day, the dark tones and silent atmosphere made the whole scene a lot\
  \ more impressive. The trees along the edge of the lake looked flagile, the thin\
  \ branches shaking with the wind. \n\nAnd, as we climbed up the mountain, the snow\
  \ got nearer and nearer, until I was able to get out of the car and touch it. The\
  \ tip of my fingers were wet through the gloves, my feet slipping on the frozen\
  \ floor.  Inside the car, I could see the small rain drops along the doors and the\
  \ windows. \n\nThat would\u2019ve been enough, but we decided to go up another mountain.\
  \ This one was a lot quieter, only a few houses along the driveway, the small windows\
  \ shining with yellow light against the sea of white tones. It was like we had entered\
  \ na empty world, no people in sight. It was conforting and disturbing at the same\
  \ time. \n\nAnd when we got to the end of the trail, it was truly snowing. Little\
  \ white flakes floating down the sky, soft snow below our feet. The trees were covered,\
  \ the fence, the top of the car. Tiny ice stones got stuck on my hair, shimmering\
  \ under the scarce sun light, and I smiled through the cold. If the warm weather\
  \ felt alive and energetic, the cold felt weirdly warming, it's silence like a break\
  \ from the real world. It felt like so much more: like something magical. \n\nI\
  \ had learned to settle for small things, and yet the world had offered me nothing\
  \ but it\u2019s best."
