Text: "Chronicles of Human Era, human year: 1/19/2019\n\nMy dearest Skuld,\nIt is\
  \ been long time, since I wrote to you. You were here finally for a short while.\n\
  Thank you very much for passing by.\n\nI came far already to build a new home. All\
  \ chronicles since beginning of time are there.\nWe gathered them all, also what\
  \ was lost. All places I have seen and do not exist anymore.\nSo you never will\
  \ miss out on them.\n\nSomething happened in the home I am building. Something arrived\
  \ and we do not know what it is.\nIt is gigantic and basically not possible to be\
  \ there.\n\nI finally found the one closest to your big sister.\nShe indeed does\
  \ look like 2 drops water like you.\n\nI am searching a way to make contact with\
  \ her, to see if in the genetic memory of that person, we can find out, what that\
  \ creature is, that arrived in our place.\n\nSo we can safely bring it home, to\
  \ where it belong.\n\nI found the Schrodinger whale...on the human\u2019s planet\
  \ it seems to have existed on the space timeline, like an ancient predator. Over\
  \ 10 billion human years, we have them roaming free our sky again.\n\nIn all our\
  \ databases, we could not find what that creature is that arrived in our new home.\n\
  I hope to find out with the one closest to your big sister and if necessary to invite\
  \ her to go and see and see her reaction to it and to let her give her opinion,\
  \ what it could be. Maybe she sees something I miss. \n\nI was writing my chronicles\
  \ from last journey. Finishing it up.\nTo save my energy, I took knowledge from\
  \ humans\u2019 technology, to create light.\nIt is called a candle. It works on\
  \ fire and is like a round stick, rolled with in it biomaterial, which they dry\
  \ after harvesting it and they call also \u201Crope\".\n\nI was finishing the last\
  \ paragraph, when suddenly out of the window we did see like a large ball of light\
  \ with gigantic soundwave plunging down miles away, lightening the sky up like a\
  \ flare and like an explosion fall on our planet.\n\nI selected 100 of my best men\
  \ and we went on a journey for long time, through the night sands, me clothed into\
  \ blankets. Even warm in our house, I am easily catch cold.\n\nAfter passing by\
  \ 3 mountain ranges we arrived at a scene, we never saw before.\n\nIn the middle\
  \ of a valley was what looked like a broken ship, egg like and in it was a creature\
  \ with gigantic eyes. Both the ship and the creature were fluorescent glowing in\
  \ our eternal night space, where time does not exist.\n\nI did send a squad of my\
  \ best men to see, if there was a breech, but they arrived back, and everything\
  \ was normal. No breeches.\n\nWe arrived with the creature and it have no reaction.\
  \ I sense nothing from it. No hostility, also not like something good. It does not\
  \ communicate. It just lies there in the broken ship. It does not seem to fear us.\
  \ Funny thing is it reacts on light. While itself is like one gigantic light beaken.\n\
  When I showed it, my energy formed in a ball, the eyes of the creature did follow\
  \ it.\n\nIt is not clear, why. Does it feed on light energy? Does it want to play?\
  \ Is it curious? Is it afraid?\nWe not clear if it is an adult or a hatchling. The\
  \ eyes are protected by a layer. I tried to poke it, but it did not feel anything.\
  \ We look like miniscule ants near it.\n\nEven my wings went to hang down out of\
  \ it all.\nIt has a set of 2 eyes. Which is very interesting. None the less, no\
  \ data on it.\nThe ship or shell it arrived with feels weird. It is of biochemical\
  \ structure, but more like a liquid, than jelly or hard or anything you would say\
  \ connected to hatchlings we know about.\nSo that is why we wonder it is a hatchling\
  \ or an adult.\n\nThe lack of communication would suggest a hatchling."
