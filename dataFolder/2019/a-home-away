Text: "What gives everything and asks for nothing but time? For me, it is traveling.\
  \ Of course, there may be the question of money, but that is nothing compared to\
  \ everything I get to experience while traveling. The people, the food, all the\
  \ nooks and crannies of places big and small - that is what stays with me after\
  \ the trip is over. I have always dreamt of going places.\n\tA part of the world\
  \ I can go to again and again without tiring is Italy. It is fitting, seeing how\
  \ I find it hard to turn away from the unexplored and the country has so much to\
  \ offer. Italy is a diverse country but the one common theme I have noticed is -\
  \ it feels like home. By home I don\u2019t mean a physical one but rather the feeling\
  \ I get when surrounded by the people there, the atmosphere, everything, even the\
  \ bad parts. It\u2019s imperfectly perfect. It was an unexpected revelation. \n\t\
  In 2016 I stepped on a plane for the first time. It was also my first time in Italy.\
  \ Before then I already knew that I would love both the flight and the destination.\
  \ I went to Venice and fell in love with the city - the architecture, the people,\
  \ and, yes, the food. Sure, there are some unpleasant features, but where aren\u2019\
  t? The culture, oh, the culture\u2026 I can still remember the friendly waiter with\
  \ his Italian accent, curly hair and carefree smile sharing stories and laughs with\
  \ me like we were old friends. I felt like I was in a completely different world.\n\
  \tTwo years later, in 2018, I got to experience more of that Italian charm. This\
  \ time I went on a more spontaneous trip starting in the city of Bergamo, where\
  \ I found my new favorite Italian pastry - baguette with chocolate chips. It\u2019\
  s amazing. Bergamo is great because I love hiking and exploring and it is located\
  \ near the Alps. Speaking of the Alps, on the spur of the moment I decided I wanted\
  \ to go hiking in the mountains so I ended up traveling to Lovere. There I went\
  \ hiking and, though it was a lot of work, ultimately it was relaxing and rewarding,\
  \ especially being able to see the beauty of nature. I found Lovere to be discreetly\
  \ alluring. That being said, I wouldn\u2019t use those words to describe Milan,\
  \ which was my final stop. Milan is a city that gets attention whether it is wanted\
  \ or not so there is place for being discreet. The streets were filled with tourists\
  \ all rushing to get pictures of anything that moves and everything that doesn\u2019\
  t. I was the complete opposite. Just at the Duomo di Milano I spent several hours\
  \ exploring the cathedral inside and out. There is much more to be found if time\
  \ is taken and attention paid. The locals are not what I had expected. On one occasion,\
  \ a local started a conversation with me and even gave me a small tour of parts\
  \ of the city. Back in Latvia, my native country, no one would ever start a conversation,\
  \ much less offer to show me around. It just goes to show how unlike cultures are.\n\
  \tSome people have bucket lists. When they have been to a bucket-listed country,\
  \ they cross it out. I could never do that. Just one time isn't enough. There is\
  \ always something waiting to be discovered. Traveling is what gives me everything\
  \ and asks for nothing but time in return. I was open-minded the first time I went\
  \ to Italy, and what I found was unexpected - it\u2019s the place I keep going back\
  \ to time and time again. Italy is my home away."
