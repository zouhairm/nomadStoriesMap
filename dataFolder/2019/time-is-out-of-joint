Text: "The edges of thin paper whisper together as I roll a cigarette and listen.\
  \ Dewi is speaking with passion about permaculture. \u201CNo waste. For everything\
  \ we take from the land, the idea is to return something. Equilibrium.\u201D The\
  \ night is totally black (The island of M\xF8n is an International Dark Sky Community)\
  \ and it is very cold. We are sat on a small concrete balcony, second floor, eastern\
  \ side of M\xF8n Retreat Center, a large red-brick building that used to be an asylum.\
  \ Somewhere to the right of us, Dewi\u2019s two harems of chickens are asleep, in\
  \ her tiny smallholding. In front, below the sky, a flat expanse of industrial farmland.\
  \ A gold electric glow marks one of several colossal, empty tractors, which murmur\
  \ as they cross and recross the fields throughout the night. \n\nThe next morning,\
  \ Patrick collects eggs from Dewi\u2019s chickens while I sit in meditation. I am\
  \ here as a spiritual tourist, performing menial jobs in exchange for food, board,\
  \ and participation in the centre\u2019s exercises. I am hunting for enlightenment.\
  \ I clean and mop the grey linoleum corridors on all three floors, and then, wearing\
  \ a gas mask, sand the old flooring of the bedrooms so that chemical dust billows\
  \ through the same hallways, covering every surface. I practice brief imaginative\
  \ meditations, and colours become more vivid, sounds louder, everything more real.\
  \ At night, the tractors churn about the centre while we sleep. \n\nThe centre is\
  \ run by Johannes, who has long, golden hair and a beard. He looks like Christ when\
  \ he dresses in white trousers and a white shirt, and beams with charisma. He drives\
  \ a white van with his name on the side and works to exhaustion. I am one of several\
  \ international volunteers. Previously, volunteers had to pay for their own food\
  \ while working for free, which caused trouble. I clean the cavernous white Buddha\
  \ Hall at the top of the centre, trying to focus on the sensations of holding the\
  \ mop, and my feet as they shuffle about. The foot feels the foot when it feels\
  \ the ground. Sometimes I am angry, sometimes melancholic. In the Buddha Hall, we\
  \ sing the Tone Fra Himlen, \u201CThe Note from Heaven\u201D, a single note sustained\
  \ for an hour and a half. I feel that I have effaced my self in divinity, and come\
  \ to the dinner table ecstatic, blissful. \n\nPeople are leaving rural areas of\
  \ Denmark like M\xF8n for Copenhagen, Aarhus, and the other cities. Giant, fantastic\
  \ hares the size of small deer flee across the fields while I cycle about the island\
  \ on a bike I\u2019ve borrowed. One morning a shaman from Peru visits the centre\
  \ to perform an Ayahuasca ceremony and sings in the garden. The wind can be very\
  \ strong, so strong that I am almost unable to move forwards while running against\
  \ it, like seabirds are sometimes held against the wind. Gr\xF8nsalen is a 100m\
  \ by 10m burial mound that is over 5,500 years old. A sign relates this in English\
  \ and German. The black metal silhouettes of wolves, bird scarers, swing about in\
  \ the wind and frighten me when they are suddenly there, as a pack, out of the mist.\
  \ In the summer John De Ruiter, a Canadian philosopher, will visit the centre. He\
  \ speaks from inspired states to sold-out audiences, and a day in his presence costs\
  \ about 1000 DKK, or double that with accommodation. \u201CThe heart is the first\
  \ space where we can be the same as our being or we can be different from our being.\
  \ In the heart, we\u2019re either closing and hardening, or opening and softening.\u201D\
  \n\nThe centre is full of literature about spiritual retreat in India, in Europe,\
  \ in America. It all seems very expensive to me, and I find it difficult to reconcile\
  \ the messages of universal divinity with the high price tags attached to these\
  \ experiences. I become disenchanted and crabby. I help Dewi to turn over the soil\
  \ where she will plant vegetables, using a garden fork. The points bend and must\
  \ be reset in a vice. I step down on the fork, move back a foot and do it again.\
  \ My mind is perfectly, blissfully empty."
