Text: "I get off the plane exhausted and slightly queasy.\n\nI make my way into Cologne,\
  \ Germany with the intention of making my way into Bonn three days after my arrival\
  \ to attend a convention organized for and by fans of the Hobbit Trilogy.\n\nI am\
  \ nervous - this is my first trip out of Canada in a while, and this time, I am\
  \ doing it alone. It's certainly a frightening experience, but I am excited all\
  \ the same.\n\nCologne is more beautiful than I imagine it to be, even if it's a\
  \ little colder than my native Vancouver. The history in Cologne is much richer\
  \ and deeper than that of Vancouver and it's so evident it's almost shocking.\n\n\
  I feel more awed and cowed by the number of visual differences there are between\
  \ this city and my own - the Cathedral that sits off the Rhine in the core of Downtown\
  \ Cologne is bigger than I imagine a cathedral of European caliber to be. \n\nThe\
  \ architecture is a style that is based out of the High and Late Middle Ages, as\
  \ opposed to the Gothic Revival style of Vancouver's own cathedral, which grew popular\
  \ in the early 19th century. \n\nThe Cologne Cathedral is as intimidating as the\
  \ history of its city, which I know little about, save the little information I\
  \ managed to retain through the Hop On, Hop Off tour I managed to scavenge enough\
  \ money for. But it was money that I had spent and spent well, even if I was too\
  \ exhausted to properly absorb the history behind this gorgeous city.\n\nThe three\
  \ days I spent in Cologne went by too fast, however. I would spend the rest of my\
  \ time in Germany indoors, celebrating the last of four Hobbit-themed conventions,\
  \ and the end of the Hobbit Trilogy. That experience felt far more different and\
  \ overwhelming than what I had previously observed. Where in Cologne, there was\
  \ a culture that prided itself on its architecture and history, HobbitCon prided\
  \ itself on its ability to bring people together based on a common interest.\n\n\
  I had entered a world full of people that not only had similar interests but were\
  \ just as excited about it as I was. We not only spent time with some of the actors\
  \ of Middle Earth but with each other. I had partied hard, met my heroes and made\
  \ some friends in the middle of a country that held so much history.\n\nI didn't\
  \ expect it to be so beautiful. I didn't expect to be in such awe and wonder of\
  \ a pair of cities. I didn't know how much fun I would have and it exceeded all\
  \ my expectations. \n\nIt gives me so much joy to know that in the midst of these\
  \ beautiful cities, there can be a gathering of similarly minded people, all keen\
  \ on celebrating something as wonderful and awe-inspiring as a set of movies."
