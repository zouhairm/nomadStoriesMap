  \ asked to go for a trip from Chandigarh  to Goa by train.\nI think train I lots\
  \ of fun,  we (me and my friends)  got interacted with other people's . The compartment\
  \ of train in which I was,  we get to know each one there, we shared the train for\
  \ 2days almost. After that when we land on the station we got welcomed by the locals.\n\
  We went to hotel and rest for whole day and in night we went to club cabana. \n\
  The journey  to club was awesome as we were on scooters that we lend in the morning.\
  \ \nThen we went to baga beach at 2 in midnite.  \nI tried the sea food there for\
  \ first time and got on date from the restaurant through  tinder and spend my lots\
  \ of time with her for two days roaming around as she was local and took me to harbor\
