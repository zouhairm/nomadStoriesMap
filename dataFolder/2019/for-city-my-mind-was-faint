Text: "For city my mind was faint\n\n#Ammar Bokari\n\nThis city, which since I came\
  \ to it ... Its features still talk to me about everything, its innocence and what\
  \ it means naive, its name and what beauty means - even negated - to take sides\
  \ in it and then appear to me from time to time. And she does not forget to talk\
  \ about those unique curves, her streets and her planned layout in a way that might\
  \ strike the mind with fainting.\n\nWhen you pass between the buildings you want\
  \ to have a certificate or a place that may come to him and inhabit it, from the\
  \ many failures in this matter, I noticed that the story of the homeland does not\
  \ destroy the story of man.\n\nThe people in this city do not disappear until they\
  \ fall to the dawn under an excuse to occupy it or to walk ... You will not find\
  \ those who grow wheat in it, but they are a puzzle that will appear forgotten;\
  \ but they see all the story of the story of the countryside and valleys, rivers\
  \ and epics and ancestors in Upper Egypt...\n\nDo not move away; we are here between\
  \ a jigsaw puzzle and a place not far; where buildings and high surfaces and there\
  \ I mean here is all that looks beautiful perhaps you may not see for a moment or\
  \ a glimpse of individual to fill your eyes of them. But wherever you go, your looks\
  \ look for beauty! You'll see beauty.\n\n\nThere is nothing I can not describe in\
  \ my city really, because it is a difference between them and the land that submitted\
  \ sins from them a while ago, it is shaped by the walls and walls of walls and mosques,\
  \ schools and churches and amusement parks and cafes do not forget the congestion\
  \ of the past street towards the Liberation Complex being known to all They come\
  \ as passersby and dwellers.\n\nAnd do not forget that called Dokki street where\
  \ the features of Egypt and Yemen are mixed happy. The houses are woven with threads\
  \ of purple silk in the engraving of the stones, and the compliance of the places\
  \ on the pavement and in the gardens and amusement parks and high congestion and\
  \ the population census board amazes those who see the rise of the number of another.\n\
  Is the Nile and the Pyramids are Pharaoh is the mother of cities and nations\nEgypt\
  \ is civilization, ancient and Canaanite \nUnique Egypt"
