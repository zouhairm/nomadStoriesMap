Text: "Upon my arrival to South Korea for the Olympic Games I did anticipate building\
  \ rapport with local people. Yet, my first attempt to make a local connection failed\
  \ in the most ridiculous and unexpected way. This is how it happened...\n\nThe studio\
  \ \"Vladimir Vinetskii and Co\" presents a one-act performance:\n\"Famous Korean\
  \ Hospitability OR How They Kicked Me out of Hostel in Seoul on my First Day After\
  \ Arrival\".\n--- place of action: Windroad and Flowers Guesthouse \n--- time of\
  \ action: 1st February, 2018. 11 o'clock in the morning\n--- the characters: the\
  \ woman (owner of the hostel), probably her helper (poor man!), your humble narrator\
  \ (Vladimir Vinetskii)\nALL THE EVENTS DESCRIBED FURTHER ARE 100 % TRUE. AT LEAST,\
  \ THIS IS HOW I SAW IT.\n\nIt is about 11.00 in the capital of South Korea. A hungry\
  \ lodger Vladimir is descending the stairs, anticipating a hearty morning meal -\
  \ just to see that the breakfast is over...\n\nVV: Is the breakfast finished?\n\
  The man: Yeah.\nVV (irritably): I thought it was till 12.00. That's what the woman\
  \ told me yesterday. \nThe man (mumbling something); no... not really...it is in\
  \ the fridge...\nTHE WOMAN APPEARS.\nVV: I thought you told me yesterday that the\
  \ breakfast is from 9.00 till 12.00. Isn't that true??\nThe woman: (in a loud voice):\
  \ No!! Till 11.00. It is written on the wall...\nVV (pointing at a black mark near\
  \ the breakfast time - the time 11.00 is written above that spot): Here? And what\
  \ is this? \nThe woman: (hysterically): Do you think I am a liar?\nVV (calmly):\
  \ I can think whatever I want.\nThe woman: (going sad and mad at the same time):\
  \ You are crazy! I want you to to get out of my hostel!! Get out! In 30 minutes\
  \ you must be out of my place!!\nVV (looking at the watch): The check-out time is\
  \ at 12.00. It means I have 45 minutes.\nThe woman (pathetically): YOU ARE CRAZY!\
  \ If you stay longer I will call the police...\nVV: I think I will describe the\
  \ way you treat guests on Booking.com\nThe woman (clasping hands): Of course, you\
  \ can do it, if you want! You will never stay here any more!! We have a special\
  \ black list...\nVV: Do not worry. I do not want to stay in a place where you treat\
  \ guests like this.\nThe woman (blue from shouting): I want you to leave NOW!! You\
  \ are crazy! Here is your money (opens the drawer and throws out 9000 won) - get\
  \ out or I'll call the police!!!\nVV: Ha-ha-ha.\nThe woman: GET OUT!!!\nVV: HA-HA-HA-HA-HA!\n\
  The man (from the corner, timidly): He, he, he...\nThe woman (all trembling): I\
  \ often have Russian guests but.. never.. (murmers in Korean) I WANT you to get\
  \ out of MY hostel!\nVV (calmly puts his money in the pocket): Fine. My luggage\
  \ is packed. I am leaving.\nThe woman (suddenly in a cool business - like manner):\
  \ Wait, you have to sign a document (hands a check for refund. As soon as the signature\
  \ appears on paper yells again): Go out now!!\nVV (getting into the garden): Farewell.\n\
  The woman (through the door): Never ever - come here again!! (the door slams open\
  \ - her red face peeps out) Or I will call the police!! (shuts the door) You are\
  \ CRAZY! (the door opens again - the face in it is 50 shades of red) DO YOU THINK\
  \ I AM A LIAR!!!??? (slams it shut with a Great Bang).\n\nVladimir Vinetskii scratches\
  \ his head with a grin, then grabs the rucksack and walks along the morning street\
  \ which is already full of busy Koreans, hurrying in all directions...\n\nTHE END"
