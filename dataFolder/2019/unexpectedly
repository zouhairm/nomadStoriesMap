Text: "I didn\u2019t expect to find happiness in an unexpected place. Let me take\
  \ you from the beginning. It all started on a fine July morning or probably not\
  \ that fine morning. I woke up at two P.M. and I headed towards my kitchen when\
  \ my dad say me and started asking \u201CAre you okay? You look sad\u201D to which\
  \ I started sobbing. I know it might seem like a no big deal but the reason why\
  \ I was devastated is because my summer wasn\u2019t going as I expected it go. In\
  \ June I was supposed to go to Turkey but because of visa problems I didn\u2019\
  t (and yes I eventually went to Turkey in August and the embassy apologised for\
  \ their mistake). \n   Then my dad said \u201CWhy don\u2019t you go to Kyiv(capital\
  \ city of my country) and relax and have fun?\u201D. I felt extremely relieved and\
  \ happy because I would never say no to a travelling opportunity. I immediately\
  \ bought train tickets for the next morning and I didn\u2019t buy a return ticket.\n\
  \   I spent a few days in Kyiv. At first, it felt good and then I decided to take\
  \ things further and bought tickets to Lviv( another city in Ukraine). \n   I\u2019\
  ve had never visited Lviv therefore I was extremely excited and happy. Once I was\
  \ in Lviv I can\u2019t even express how I felt at that moment. That city is truly\
  \ breathtaking and mesmerizing. I never understood why my parents, friends or basically\
  \ who has visited this city were always ecstatic when they talked about Lviv. I\
  \ finally understood that, this city is truly filled with magic. But magic slowly\
  \ began to fade as the evening came and I was gloomy because I felt alone but then...\
  \ I saw a group of people and my first thought was \u201CThey must came to this\
  \ city as an interns at an organization where I used to work at\u201D. And guess\
  \ what? I was right and we instantly connected. I was the one who approached them\
  \ and they were nothing but friendly. I was sixteen then and for a sixteen year\
  \ old to approach foreign people in a foreign city is a big thing. I just knew I\
  \ had to follow my instinct at that moment. \n   Fast forward to few days later.\
  \ I bought tickets to go back home because there were matters to be taken care of.\
  \ I wasn\u2019t pleased but at the same time I realized that I have responsibilities.\
  \ I was sad. I didn\u2019t want to leave and also I wanted to meet my favourite\
  \ blogger because I admire her and I was in her hometown. I said my goodbyes to\
  \ my now friends and was preparing for my departure BUT my train was in the morning\
  \ but because I spent the night before with those people and had to wake up early,\
  \ I didn\u2019t get enough sleep. I decided to rest for few minutes and eventually\
  \ I woke seven minutes before my train was supposed to leave. And that\u2019s the\
  \ best thing that ever happened to me (you will understand a bit later).\n   At\
  \ that time, I was so dissatisfied for not being responsible.\nLater that day, I\
  \ was hanging out with my friends and of course they were thrilled that I missed\
  \ my train and to be honest I was happy, as well. \n   And then, out of the blue\
  \ I see my favourite blogger passing by. I was extremely nervous and excited but\
  \ I came up to her and started talking. She was extremely calm and sweet, she even\
  \ took the picture because my hands were shaking so much. After that, I saw her\
  \ again and know she knows me and we exchange few texts here and there.\n  Everything\
  \ happened so unexpectedly in the best shape or form. I am grateful for this experience.\
  \ I would have never thought I can explore and feel so many things in my own country."
