Text: "It was obvious to me that the spiralled, decadent walls of the Hotel le Caspien\
  \ had a story or two to tell. It stood gallantly, as it had done for centuries,\
  \ overlooking the wintry Marrakesh night. The faint humming of slurry murmurings\
  \ and sharp Arab melodies slithered out onto the cobbled streets of the French Quarter,\
  \ whispered deep from the hotel\u2019s gaping abdomen. Nailed onto the decorated\
  \ forehead of the hotel lay a beaten signpost. \u201CWe\u2019re hiring\u201D. I\
  \ stopped dead in my tracks on the bustling pavement, pondering. Pondering, at first\
  \ the thought of me working in a hotel. Then the thought of me hastily trudging\
  \ through the dizzying heights of the musty halls, running room service to Arab\
  \ moguls failing to understand my broken Arabic. I shuddered at the thought. \n\n\
  But the rank and beautiful smells of magnifique Marrakesh arrested my attention.\
  \ I watched a school of nonchalant taxi drivers narrowly avoid death, devilish kamikaze\
  \ motor cyclists go hell for leather and swanky leather suits sip on black coffee\
  \ and heavy tobacco; until their insides turned black and heavy. I stood there befuddled\
  \ in the smoky haze, chuckling at my expense. What was I doing here? When am I going\
  \ home? It was anyone\u2019s guess. \n\nThe truth is: I came to Morocco on a whim.\
  \ I acted on a primeval instinct that generated a gut feeling, a gut feeling telling\
  \ me that this desiccated landscape in North Africa was a prosperous meadow full\
  \ of plush green pastures. Predatory species throughout the evolution of time have\
  \ relied upon their instincts to put food on the table. Why can\u2019t I do the\
  \ same? After all, I was pretty hungry. Being a broke man with a crippling tendency\
  \ for flippant behaviour, shackled by the ever-present pillars of hedonism that\
  \ engulf every other 20-year-old male, I was destined to have a large appetite.\
  \ \n\nLo and behold, as though the devil had crept up and secretly glued his ear\
  \ to the revolving door of my thoughts, my ever-shrinking stomach growled uncontrollably.\
  \ I wasn\u2019t hungry anymore. I was starving. I had to get a move on, and the\
  \ stunningly forlorn Hotel le Caspien stood sheepishly in front of me. Just like\
  \ a malnourished moth chasing foolish visions of endless electricity, I dragged\
  \ myself into the dimly lit jaws of the hotel. \n\nI walked straight into a peculiar\
  \ bar. It was a swinging joint. Closely resembling the Mos Eisley Cantina, I spied\
  \ oddly amusing folk completely over indulging themselves, drowning themselves in\
  \ liquor that was foreign to me. The swashbuckling atmosphere was somewhat glued\
  \ together by a ragtag trio of men getting down on their Middle Eastern instruments.\
  \ My eyes were quickly drawn to the back corner. Surrounded by a smorgasbord of\
  \ red, velvety curtains, a shadowy figure sat shrouded in a whirlwind of smoke.\
  \ I peered over. It was a westerner, just like me. As she reached for the ashtray,\
  \ something in her wandering mind entertained her. She was still staring at nothing.\
  \ \n\nWith the comforting thought of a room to retreat to later, I spent the last\
  \ of my dirhams on some dry gin and pancakes. This failed to distract myself from\
  \ gazing longingly at the westerner. Without warning, she abruptly rose from the\
  \ lounge and strut forward, her gracefully swaying gait piercing through the gregarious\
  \ crowd of onlookers. Her eyebrows, poignantly arched, resembled some sort of sleek\
  \ feline performing archery. Her hair, straight as a ruler, seemed to be immaculately\
  \ painted black by the ink of a rare Black Sea squid. And those eyes! Those enthralling\
  \ emerald eyes, vividly reminding me of the plush green pastures I had longed for.\
  \ Emphatically guarding the emerald gems was a cavalry of curly eye lashes. These\
  \ evergreen lashes stood firm and upright, defying the backdrop of deciduous pot\
  \ plants choking the cracked walls of the saloon. It was clear to me that she was\
  \ a distinguished woman, revered among the parting sea of patrons. It begged the\
  \ question. What in this doggone lonesome world was she approaching me for?"
