Text: "Last year sometime around July I got the great news that i was invited to visit\
  \ the country of Malaysia with a friend that is originally from there. No I wasn\u2019\
  t going for the purpose of being a tourist but to live the life of a local citizen.\
  \ When I told my family I was going to this country, some siblings told me to be\
  \ very careful as apparently there was some type of religious persecution, but I\
  \ did not let that disturb me one bit even though I did keep that thought in the\
  \ back of my mind. The day I arrived to this country I landed in Kuala Lumpur and\
  \ I was amazed just for the simple fact I was yet in another country ready to experience\
  \ another lifestyle. The moment I got the there I was actually greeted with a smile\
  \ by the attendants waiting outside the gate as I entered the terminal and immediately\
  \ I felt welcomed and more than welcome to stay all 90 days granted by the free\
  \ visa. My friend and I then took a bus from Kuala Lumpur to the ciy of Ipoh located\
  \ in the state Perak. From the moment I exited the airplane to the moment I exited\
  \ the bus I saw so many smiles and I just knew I was going to have such an amazing\
  \ visit. My friend is Chinese, hence the majority of the people I met were Chinese\
  \ that have lived their entire life in Malaysia. I did not know Chinese culture\
  \ was big in this country so I also had the opportunity to see what life as a Chinese\
  \ was. Right off the bat I noticed that there was no type of conflict between these\
  \ two cultures despite their religions, Buddhism and Islam. Everyone seemed to live\
  \ in peace with each other and I felt so comfortable with all the positivity I was\
  \ experiencing. I noticed they had respect for each other and I say this because\
  \ some local businesses that were owned by Chinese did not allow shoes to be worn\
  \ inside and everyone respected this, wether Chinese or not. This country reminded\
  \ me of Mexico (my parents\u2019 home country) so much because of all the locally\
  \ owned restaurants and street food vendors. On this one occasion my friend and\
  \ I stopped on the side of a busy road to purchase a few coconuts form a family\
  \ of three, to drink out of. As it was in the open I was able to see all the nature\
  \ surrounding me, the mountains covered in trees in the distance, as I drank out\
  \ of a fresh coconut. I thought to myself,  \u201Cwow, people here really know what\
  \ life is.\u201D Shortly after we got served our coconuts the man kindly gave us\
  \ a free coconut for no reason. Just out of his heart and such simple action was\
  \ really touching. When we prepared to leave I went up to him personally and gave\
  \ him a tip for his action but he rejected it and I was able to see he didn\u2019\
  t want it simply because he did it for nothing in return. Since he saw my friend\
  \ already in the car and ready to start the car he gratefully accepted it and it\
  \ put an even bigger smile on his face. We did not speak the same language but our\
  \ actions was what mattered and it was something so simple that could be passed\
  \ down with no effort, something so simple that most likely changed the course of\
  \ his day and definitely mine. Another this is that I never saw a single person\
  \ be on their cellphone in any of the many restaurants I attended. Everyone graciously\
  \ embraced each other at the table and enjoyed their food without ever taking a\
  \ picture of it. Every place I visited from restaurants to massage parlors, I was\
  \ treated with so much respect and generosity but not because I was a tourist but\
  \ because I am human just like every other person I came across in this perspective\
  \ changing trip."
