Text: "\u201COnce you hear the engine going, start to push, okay?\u201D\n\n\u201C\
  OK.\u201D\n\nWe were half way to the bottom of a steep hill, with one side over\
  \ grown with the jungles under brush, and the other side a straight drop into the\
  \ rapid river that had flooded over the road. I could hear the engine starting up\
  \ and braced myself to push. The car gave way and started climbing slowly up the\
  \ hill.\nThank god, I thought to myself as I leaned into the car. But then I felt\
  \ the cars weight coming back on me, Jake was beeping the horn - \n\n\"What? What\
  \ are you doing? JAKE!!\"\n\nI scrambled out from behind the car as he started reversing.\
  \ I saw that although we had moved up the hill, we had also moved closer to the\
  \ edge of the cliff.\n\n\"Damn it!\" I panted. My shirt wet \u2013 a mixture from\
  \ the humidity and sweat. \n\n\"Don't worry, we\u2019ll try again.\" Jake had gotten\
  \ out of the car, assessed his positioning and climbed back in.\n\n\"I'm going to\
  \ reverse, reposition the tires, climb as far as I can, and then we'll lay traction\
  \ again\" \n\nNodding, I took a step back. We were in the jungles of the Bijagual\
  \ Mountain, nestled in Carara National park, just off the pacific coast of Costa\
  \ Rica. The ground was a deep, terra cotta red with lush palms and ferns covering\
  \ much of the forest floor, except for the dirt roadway we were on. Trees towered\
  \ over us, with bright coloured leaves unfolding from their trunks, dancing in the\
  \ breeze that graced them. Vines hung down from the canopy, tempting me to take\
  \ hold and test their strength. Breathing in the fresh mountain air, I wandered\
  \ towards the edge of the hill top, looking down on to the river, watching as it\
  \ cut through trees and under growth, I marvelled at the beauty. Our intent had\
  \ been to visit the Carara National Park for a day trip, hoping to catch a private\
  \ tour through the jungle and up to the Bijagual waterfall. Even if this wasn\u2019\
  t what I had been expecting, I felt as though I couldn\u2019t really complain.\n\
  I could hear the tires spinning and went to retrieve anything that could provide\
  \ traction. We used sticks, pebbles and giant leaves from the palms. Jake got back\
  \ in the car, stuck his head out the window -  \n\n\u201COK, on three, push \u2013\
  \ I\u2019ll honk the horn if we start slipping again.\u201D\n\n\u201CAlright,\u201D\
  \ Rolling up my sleeves, digging my heels into the wet ground, I braced the rear\
  \ bumper. While I was certainly enjoying the unfamiliar nature around me, there\
  \ was a voice in the back of my head, whispering the real concern that we may not\
  \ be able to get the rental up this hill. We hadn\u2019t seen anyone for miles,\
  \ and it was getting later in the day. Feeling the cars vibrations brought me out\
  \ of my worries, and I pushed with all my strength \u2013 anxiety turns can be quite\
  \ the adrenaline boost, in the right situation. I could feel the car moving forward,\
  \ slowly; the sticks cracking under the weight. I took one step, then another and\
  \ another. We were getting up the hill! I could see the bend at the top now! Come\
  \ on, come on!  I could feel my feet slipping, and I prayed I wouldn\u2019t lose\
  \ my grip \u2013 right as the car slipped from my hands. I braced myself for impact,\
  \ hitting the ground I felt my hands sinking into the wet mud. \nCursing, I expected\
  \ to see the tires spinning in place. I looked up \u2013 not only was Jake up the\
  \ hill but had driven a good 10 meters just to be sure! He came running back to\
  \ me, helping get me to my feet. We stood there, embracing each other, laughing\
  \ away the whispered worries. We looked down, onto the river, crumbling little bits\
  \ of the road away.  \n\n\u201CAre you hungry?\u201D He asked, mud splattered over\
  \ his cheeks, but excitement in his eyes. \n\n\u201CI could eat,\u201D I laughed,\
  \ turning back towards the car, covered in mud."
