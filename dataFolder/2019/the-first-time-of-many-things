Text: "The First time, of many things!\nMy trip to Greece and Italy was not a usual\
  \ one like the others. It was full of first experiences, indeed great experiences\
  \ and memories. The first ever trip that I built by myself from scratch, it was\
  \ a great learning, though a bit tedious to make the entire plan of 14 days, not\
  \ knowing much about the destination. Again, it being my first ever European or\
  \ long haul destination trip, nothing was as easy as the Asian or short haul destinations.\
  \ Finally, with great efforts and research I had my plan in place and booked the\
  \ required Flights, trains, ferries and accommodation \u2013 Ready, Set to go!\n\
  The best part of my journey, the first ever solo travel experience in the historic\
  \ city of Athens, Greece. There were butterflies, thoughts, fear, excitement and\
  \ a lot of mixed emotions while looking forward to this experience. As I land and\
  \ exit the airport, I stand there calculating my options to reach the hotel with\
  \ my two heavy bags (being an Indian it takes time to learn how to travel light,\
  \ right?) and obviously a taxi was not on my list of options for sure. Metro journey\
  \ followed by a Local bus was my final selection, while I started following the\
  \ Metro icon and in no time I was there. I board the train and to my surprise everything\
  \ seemed much like my home country, people were smiling, they were friendly and\
  \ helpful, people sat on their bags if seats weren\u2019t available and the best\
  \ throwback \u2013 a young boy singing in the Metro to earn his meal for the day.\
  \ I exit the Metro station, looking for the bus stop where I would get the bus for\
  \ my hotel, this was a crazy experience, after a lot of here and there, round and\
  \ round, climbing slopes back and forth, amused as I see the bus stop right opposite\
  \ to the Metro station I had exited from. Soon I got into the bus to my destination,\
  \ and another funny incident occurs, I am standing at the exit door just before\
  \ my stop would arrive, the bus doesn\u2019t stop! New learning, there was a red\
  \ button near the door which I had to press if I wanted to disembark the bus. I\
  \ made sure doing that on the next stop and another walk in my kitty, back towards\
  \ the hotel.\n\u201CI am exhausted and should start my exploration the next day\u201D\
  , a part of me says, on the other hand, I freshen up and I am in the Hotel lobby\
  \ within an hour! Not having much time, I decide to visit the Plaka district, an\
  \ old town with local shops and restaurants, for some strolling followed by Dinner.\
  \ I gather few bus numbers, and I am there sitting at the bus stop. It is one hour\
  \ past, not even one bus out of my list stops. Seriously! Due to some road blocks,\
  \ the buses were not operational. However, I get to know that the area is just few\
  \ minutes\u2019 walk, so I start moving as per the directions. Again returning back\
  \ to the hotel, lost my way going round and round, coming back outside the same\
  \ restaurant almost four times. I am walking on the dark streets of a place completely\
  \ unknown, a bit scared and equally excited watching the historic buildings and\
  \ their magnificent lighting effect along my way. The day ends with a lot of lost\
  \ routes yet exciting and beautiful memories!"
