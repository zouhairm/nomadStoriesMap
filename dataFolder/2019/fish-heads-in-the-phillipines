Text: "Manila was not my favourite destination. I\u2019d been ripped off, followed,\
  \ given an awful hotel room and felt bruised and culture shocked.\nLacking the will\
  \ for much solo exploration, I accepted a ride with a caleche driver around the\
  \ city. He seemed personable and not pushy. When we arrived back at my hotel he\
  \ asked my plans for the next day. I told him there were none and he offered to\
  \ collect me and take me to meet his family. I was 23, bored and alone and so I\
  \ agreed.\nThe next day, looking like someone from a bad American tourist video,\
  \ I hopped into the caleche expecting a 15 minute trot to a suburban house. What\
  \ I got was an odyssey into the jungle.\nThe driver, whose name I don\u2019t even\
  \ remember, returned the horse and caleche to a stable in a slum filled with dwellings\
  \ made of cardboard, plywood, metal sidings and tarpaulin. Nerves kicked in watching\
  \ kids pick over items from the nearby garbage dump while I stood in pastel shorts\
  \ and shirt complete with camera around my neck, blonde hair and jaunty flowery\
  \ hat.\n\nNo one knows I\u2019m here thought I. No one even knows I\u2019ve left\
  \ Australia. There are turning points in your life when you travel as a solo woman,\
  \ where you weigh up your situation quickly and then shrug internally and commit\
  \ to the inevitable fact that the consequences of your route may lead to loneliness\
  \ at best, disappearance and death at worst. I shrugged and decided it was my time\
  \ or it wasn\u2019t and relaxed into the experience, \nWe walked to a train station\
  \ and took a train into the countryside. Green, everything green. We talked about\
  \ life and the accident of birth. At length we alighted and got into a jeepney-\
  \ the jeeps left by departing American troops after the war which now serve as pimped\
  \ up taxis - and bumped and rocked out over stony roads until my driver yelled at\
  \ the jeepney to stop.\nDown a lane we came to a wooden house surrounded by chickens,\
  \ children and dripping trees. The children took me to a large dam where hundreds\
  \ of them swam and played and leaped off the banks. They swarmed around me touching\
  \ my long blonde hair, and chattering in Tagalog. I\u2019ve never felt more alive\
  \ than in those moments in a brown water dam.\nThe driver\u2019s children walked\
  \ me to their house and a meal was served. A cauldron of soup with fish heads bobbing\
  \ on top. As guest of honour fish heads came my way and too terrified to offend\
  \ them, I crunched and chewed through bone and eyeball and skin.\nHours past talking\
  \ and playing with children and then my driver took me home. Back along the lane,\
  \ into a jeepney, back on the train and walking, walking to my hotel.\nCould I pay\
  \ him I asked? \nAbsolutely not he replied. \nCould I send anything to his family?\
  \ \nMaybe shoes, and pencils he replied.\nI flew onto England the next day, and\
  \ then back to Australia eventually and I gathered flip flops and pens and notebooks\
  \ and packaged them up and sent them.\nI\u2019ll never know if they reached the\
  \ family and I\u2019ve never returned to Manila. The day will stay in my memory\
  \ forever though. To travel alone is to trust in human good and I always will."
