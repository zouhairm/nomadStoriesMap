Text: "Country like India, the culturally driven, lots of Traditions and culturally\
  \ diversified.Heaven for season lovers.  We from southern part of India,TamilNadu\
  \ state, strong tradition oriented. Had a big dream of traveling Coolest snowfull\
  \ destination(we have never seen a snow in our life). It was still in planning stage\
  \ still a dream for 3 years.. And now this is our final year of our college and\
  \ in 10 days we gonna complete our degree.  And we can't wait any more.  As a typical\
  \ Indian parents they didn't allowed for a trip that too alone without any guardians\
  \ without any Senior people.  Somehow after a Big world War 3 we got permission\
  \ to go for a trip with some terms and conditions. Welcome to the trip ROHTANG,\
  \  Himalayas. Started our journey from Chennai airport to delhi.  And we booked\
  \ a Car there and started our road trip to \"Manali\"One of The chillest place in\
  \  India. The moment we Got into the Car after having delhi special Chat and panipuri.\
  \ Hot sun literally burning us each and every kilometer we stopped and had a Lemon\
  \ soda(lemonade)  the only Survivor from survyadev(god of sun).  Then on our way\
  \ to Manali We had our lunch in Punjabi dhabba.  Such a big thali we Couldn't complete\
  \ it and we couldn't stop eating also such a taste. And yeah final touch \"lassi\"\
  (a thick drink which is made outta curd)  if you Missed punjab's lassi mark my words\
  \ you have made a sin and booked tickets to hell. Such a Heartwarming drink it is.\
  \  After a long drive of almost 5 hours,  the driver opened the window and Switched\
  \ off the AC. OMG!!  Such a welcoming chilled Wind.  Surrounded by trees Just in\
  \ a minute we feel like we have shifted from Sahara to Swiss... Yeah that's our\
  \ India.  We started climbing mountains towards manali Round and round and round\
  \ we travelled and after 8 hours of road trip and several on the way clicks we reached\
  \ Manali and Checked in a hotel which was in top of the hill with a great view of\
  \ whole manali city. And from our balcony we saw a white mountain full of snow..\
  \ That was our first time to even see it from far.. We were so excited and Couldn't\
  \ wait to reach there with hoodies and have snowball fight.  Early morning we went\
  \ for a Horse ride to Solang valley..Just a horse ride what's fun and adventurous\
  \ in this. Being a adventure lovers we were not that happy but yet we took a horse\
  \ ride.. And literally that horse kicked our thoughts. It was such a terrifying\
  \ experience we ever had. Literally the horse was climbing a mountain which is filled\
  \ with stones and no proper way and not even a good handles for grip. And it is\
  \ a single ride there is no driver I mean no one is guiding the horse.. 20 minutes\
  \ horse ride to the top of the mountain.  Trust me it was 2 years back trip but\
  \ still I feel that thrill while writing This article. we returned back to Down\
  \ the hill with the same horses and going down felt like riding in a roller coaster.\
  \ A 20 minutes long roller coster is definitely not for a heart patient. Had a great\
  \ evening in a kullu district we went back to our Hotel. Next day it was Our dream\
  \ day we were on our way to Rhotang ready with our outfit and we were discussing\
  \ what all we should do their.  We finally reached there seeing the snow we couldn't\
  \ sit inside the car,  we just jumped to the Snow we rushed there and That smile\
  \ we had is Immortal. Then we Went for Cable car drive to another hill And reached\
  \ To the most beautiful place I have ever seen we started Throwing snow on each\
  \ other we rolled down from the hill and  camping beside a lake there,  Watching\
  \ stars sitting Beside the fire A short,  Fast,  last night.Come on this is our\
  \ dream trip we can't have such an end.  On the way from Manali we saw went for\
  \ rafting in deadlyriver That's how our soulful trip got its happy ending#WeMadeIt.\u263A"
