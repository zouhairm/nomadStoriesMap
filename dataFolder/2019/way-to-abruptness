Text: "Being a software engineer I could only have the liberty to write Endless code\
  \ day in day out and once a meantime used to surf unimaginable destinations which\
  \ I ever doubt to explore.Then I started of a journey abruptly from Johor Bahru,Malaysia\
  \ to Tioman island.Being Indian travelling by bus is a common phenomenon 'coz the\
  \ process which goes into the traveling by bus  widens a perspective of mine, looking\
  \ at people expression, wondering what music or which music they would be listening,\
  \ Travelling alone from Johor Bahru bus stop to Mersing from where I am supposed\
  \ to take a ferry to the unknown not knowing how a island would look like.On the\
  \ way to Mersing I couldn't find any better words to explain the weather , sitting\
  \ facing the window looking up towards the overcast and the uninvited light drizzle\
  \ turns out to a icing on the cake.Getting over a latest break up with my girlfriend\
  \ really shattered me a bit , a much needed break and set out on a journey to find\
  \ the Invisible self.A major fact is that I only like acceleration when I am drunk\
  \ and that was not case here, as rain got heavier I was wondering how could the\
  \ driver possibly able to gauge his sight on the roads.Some talks was doing the\
  \ rounds whether the driver was drunk or something , some people went to him and\
  \ enquired is he?? Fortunately he was in control stating driving in these routes\
  \ is some kind bread and butter for him even he had some kinda whiskey or something!!!\
  \ is that worth a risk? During that moment all kind of emotions or rushing into\
  \ my mind thinking is this end of Jags that would be my name \U0001F642. That 3\
  \ hours of travel enroute to Mersing Bus stop was nothing more of a goose bump with\
  \ bus twisting itself left to right.Here we come Mersing thank God I am saved so\
  \ also 30 more people who onboarded, Jumping down all I wanted to have a coffee\
  \ and cigarette, as I was enjoying my drag , an announcement happens to be like-\
  \ the last ferry would be departed in 15 mins , the place where I was I would walk\
  \ something like 40 mins and guess what ticket need to taken, did anyone heard how\
  \ much a cab would be taken to reach the exact coordinate ? 100 MYR , that is my\
  \ 10 day lunch money ,but it had to be done 'coz if I miss the last ferry there\
  \ was no nearby hotel and I was too conservative to sleep on streets, Rushing through\
  \ the lane the cab would ask all sorts of nonsensical stuff all I was thinking Don't\
  \ miss the ferry , there he stops with 2 luggage I rushed through taking the tickets\
  \ and took leap forward to join the last batch boarding.I prefer stay outdoor in\
  \ a ferry and on the route I stayed out had a chat with couple of locals and they\
  \ would explain all sorts of things about Island with regards to food , recreational\
  \ stuff.It was indeed a great sight of mountains, birds leaving a melancholy tune\
  \ right into ears and I was wondering is this the thing which I was missing all\
  \ along, The exact nature which I had only imagined in my dreams only , glancing\
  \ to my laptop 9-5 has limited my mind and now I was open to a whole new dimension\
  \ and as everyone would quote I belong here \U0001F60A and I was no exception.Being\
  \ Technical guy all along in my life all I was analyzing what would the width of\
  \ road and how much Distance this island would cover but that didn't matter after\
  \ I bumped to place a tiny village beside there would be beach with still water\
  \ making sounds which would forms some sorts of music , I cancelled my hotel reservations\
  \ and requested those village people to accommodate me and I would sleep on the\
  \ floor, I literally begged it because I didn't wanna miss a single sight which\
  \ I would experience staying there and I stayed with them , all night long I was\
  \ awake inclined towards the sea with light breeze rushing giving a feeling of unknown."
