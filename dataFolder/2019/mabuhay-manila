Text: "Philippines as one of the member of ASEAN got my attention successfully. I\
  \ got excited when Erna, my travelmate, said she already booked a trip for us to\
  \ Manila on April 2013. I was living in Johor Bahru, Malaysia for almost 4 years\
  \ that time while finishing my study at University Technology of Malaysia. As an\
  \ Indonesian, I curious to know what kind of my neighbour country look like and\
  \ I guess traveling is the only way to find out.\nBack then, in April 2013, I already\
  \ got back to my hometown in Surabaya, Indonesia. No direct flight from Surabaya\
  \ to Manila. So, we took connecting flight via Kuala Lumpur with Air Asia. We can\
  \ only afford budget airlines and off course we only brought our backpack.\nFirst\
  \ local thing I got connected with is the local meal on flight, Chicken Adobo. We\
  \ flew from Kuala Lumpur in early morning, so I decided to have breakfast up in\
  \ the sky. Chicken Adobo is a popular Filipino dish. It is involved chicken and\
  \ vegetables marinated in vinegar, soy sauce, garlic and black pepper. This look\
  \ like a local Indonesian food called Semur Ayam, my favourite.\nSo, how I get along\
  \ with the locals? Before every trip, I always write down some itinerary. Not too\
  \ detail, but it\u2019s enough to schedule my trip per day. I found that ride a\
  \ Jeepney would make us feel more like a local. We didn\u2019t have to try hard\
  \ to look like a local, because Indonesian and Filipino are quite similar but the\
  \ languages are quite different. It is not the same with Bahasa Indonesia and Bahasa\
  \ Melayu in Malaysia, Singapore and Brunei Darussalam.\nBack to my first jeepney\
  \ ride. We took an airport jeepney from Diosdado Macapagal International Airport\
  \ to Mabalacat Bus Station with fare PHP100 per person. This airport jeepney is\
  \ quite different with the city jeepney. This one is more cozy with air conditioner.\
  \ I suggest you to learn a little bit Filipino if you want to try ride a jeepney.\
  \ There is a unique way of payment when ride a jeepney. A person can make their\
  \ payment by giving their money to the passenger next to him and passed the money\
  \ to another passanger until someone who sit close to the driver. Here you could\
  \ tell the driver you want to pay for how many people and the place you were getting\
  \ in.\nAt Mabalacat Bus Station, we can find many kind of bus which can take us\
  \ to Manila. The bus fares are approximately PHP 150 \u2013 200. Please just take\
  \ a nap on the bus because the distance from Angeles City to Manila is about 95\
  \ km. It\u2019s quite far.\nHow about the food I found in the city? Well, as a Moslem,\
  \ I have to obey my religion regulation. I need to find some halal food to eat.\
  \ As we know, Moslem is not the majority in Manila but we can make it not a big\
  \ deal to find some halal food. I brought my own beef floss from Surabaya and bought\
  \ steam rice at the nearest 7-11 in Manila. They also sell tuna sandwich and some\
  \ bread. \nManila is full with some nice buildings. The European atmosphere could\
  \ be found everywhere especially at college, church and some government buildings.\
  \ My favourite is the Cathedral church in Intramuros and the whole Intramuros itself.\n\
  I stayed at a hostel in Makati City. It\u2019s not too big but had a very nice staff,\
  \ rooms and also guests. Not only tourist, there are some locals enjoy stayed at\
  \ the hostel. One of the local guests is Patrick. He suggested some tourism place\
  \ to visit and gave some advice what route should we take to ride jeepney. He\u2019\
  s very helpful. \nI think making a connection with some locals will bring us many\
  \ advantages in a new place. We, as a traveller, need to learn some local culture,\
  \ learn their language and thanking their nice hospitality while treat a tourist\
  \ with no clue with their language before came here.\nIn the future, I\u2019d like\
  \ make a book or a continue blog which tell my kind of relationship with the locals\
  \ at the country I\u2019ve visit."
