Text: "When I placed my first blotter carefully under my tongue, I am sure I was not\
  \ aware of what I was doing. Especially as the idea came unexpectedly without my\
  \ planning or even intending to do any such thing. I could hardly have time to examine\
  \ my feelings before acting, but most probably my strongest emotion was fear overcoming\
  \ every other sensation. Fear of the unknown and of the possible evocation of memories\
  \ I longed to forget. My premonitions turned out to be groundless, though.\n\nI\
  \ travelled to C\xF3rdoba in company of a friend with a one-euro bus ticket which\
  \ I still consider as the deal of my life. Until the very moment of our arrival\
  \ we did not know where we were going to stay for the night, as our couchsurfer\
  \ Host only answered to our request the last minute. This was, however, hours before\
  \ I realized myself sitting in the terrace of a bar in a foreign country, without\
  \ my phone and wallet, unnecessary objects I had purposefully left at home in the\
  \ belief that we were only going out to dance, and even without knowing the actual\
  \ address of His place. I felt completely free with the only possession of what\
  \ I was wearing, although some time had to pass before I understood that there is\
  \ only subtle difference between freedom and vulnerability when one is in the middle\
  \ of a forest in a rave party near C\xF3rdoba where we ended up after leaving the\
  \ bar.\n\nBeing na\xEFve, as I turned out to be, I never considered as part of my\
  \ personality. But getting out of His car in the forest I could not help observing\
  \ how beautiful the stars in the sky were. I didn\u2019t realize I had already been\
  \ tripping. Even though they were shining in a neon-like blue colour and vibrating\
  \ and moving to the rhythm of music played in the background, out of which I could\
  \ only distinguish the periodic beat within my chest. \n\nThe forest was fairy tale-like.\
  \ The sky seemed like an ink-blue cover over a private little world. The contours\
  \ of the surrounding trees were melting into the silver air like watercolor being\
  \ dissolved in water. Every sense seemed to have been sharpened with the mind growing\
  \ so fast that there was no time for words to follow and express the thoughts. A\
  \ new reality revealed to me. There seemed to be an impenetrable distance between\
  \ my former life and the one I just started to live. I was looking at people from\
  \ a separate world which had no connection with what I have so far believed to be\
  \ reality. Ordinary now seemed ridiculous. It was the night of crystal-clear realizations,\
  \ understanding the importance of conscious presence and the destruction of barriers\
  \ within the brain. \n\nHowever slowly, dawn came. The increasing light seemed to\
  \ lessen the vivacity of the hallucinations. Though with the daylight a new layer\
  \ of sense of reality became unfolded. I found myself surrounded by a beautiful\
  \ scenery. Pale olive shades of green, golden yellow and pastel blue spread wherever\
  \ I looked. The plasticity of nature\u2019s colors made everything appear as part\
  \ of an Impressionist painting with mellow though glittering lights. The face of\
  \ my friend was burning with bronze fire, her features softened, skin smoothened,\
  \ though with dark circles round the eyes.\n\nThen out of the blue came the discovery\
  \ of our Host being missing. For how long, we did not know. All we knew was that\
  \ we were completely alone among strangers without any means of reaching Him, and\
  \ without the possession of an address which we could have told a taxi driver if\
  \ we had the phone and money to call one. We couldn\u2019t even remember His name.\
  \ And the conviction of our never being able to return to His place got stronger\
  \ with every minute passing.\n\u2026\nAfter all, who\u2019s to doubt that a mental\
  \ journey can be as rich and beneficial as a physical one or even more so? New questions\
  \ raised, old ones answered and the desire of knowing more boosted. Which is sort\
  \ of the aim of traveling anyways."
