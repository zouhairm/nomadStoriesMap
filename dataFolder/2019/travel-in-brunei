Text: "I chose to visit Brunei Darussalam\_this year after two Bruneian friends invited\
  \ me to visit Bandar Seri Begawan.\nLet\u2019s set the record straight about must-knows\
  \ before you travel to Brunei, what to wear in Brunei without offending folks, and\
  \ what to expect when traveling in Brunei.\n\nA lot of people only visit one or\
  \ two days in Brunei, but I\u2019d say at least four days in Brunei is perfect.\_\
  \ There\u2019s more to do than people realize, so if you\u2019re only visiting Brunei\
  \ for two days, you won\u2019t get to visit Ulu Temburong National Park.\nBruneians\
  \ LOVE tourists and Brunei might be one of the friendliest places to visit in the\
  \ world. Every single street, people would welcome me to Brunei before asking where\
  \ I\u2019m from.\nEven as we got onto a bus going to Malaysia, we were welcomed\
  \ to Brunei by a friendly local who passed by the luggage hold.\_ (It was a bit\
  \ awkward to explain we were about to get on the bus to Miri.) Bruneians absolutely\
  \ love travel, so expect to hear some stories about what they thought of your country\
  \ too. My most important tip: Make Bruneian friends! I recommend using Couchsurfing\
  \ to make new friends.\nBrunei has sharia law, but sharia law doesn\u2019t equally\
  \ apply to non-Muslims depending on the law.\_ This is a\_bigmisconception I see\
  \ on a lot of blogs written about travel in Brunei.\_ This was told to us by so\
  \ many people and although I had no plans to break the law, I was a bit nervous\
  \ before our trip. Once we were in Brunei, I was shocked how laid-back Brunei felt.\_\
  \ That said, don\u2019t be stupid and stick to your best behavior as tourists are\
  \ still a rarity in Brunei.\nMany Bruneians that we met were frustrated by Brunei\u2019\
  s perception abroad, due to stories by sensationalist newspapers elsewhere.\nTourists\
  \ are beloved, but still, try to be respectful and use your judgment.\_ This involves\
  \ trying just a little bit with dressing respectfully with not wearing sheer/ripped\
  \ clothing that might attract attention at home.\nIf you\u2019re into culture, sustainable\
  \ tourism, and elaborate architecture, you will probably enjoy traveling in Brunei.\n\
  Bruneians are proud of their country and happy to show a little piece of Brunei\
  \ to foreigners, but you also need to be interested in experiencing Brunei.\nJust\
  \ in general, avoid excessive skin, cleavage, sheer clothing, and clothing with\
  \ holes that might be seen as revealing. Use your judgment and try to dress appropriately\
  \ in Brunei.\nTo get into the major mosques in Brunei, they will give you a garment\
  \ to wear over your clothes and as well as a hijab, so no need to bring your own.\n\
  Bruneians are HUGE foodies, so don\u2019t leave without trying ambuyat and sampling\
  \ the Bruneian food at the night markets. The seafood is fresh and very spicy, so\
  \ if you see a local food centre, consider trying some seafood.\nA local also recommends\_\
  \u2018Nasi Katok\u2019\_.\_ I had a number of traditional dishes and I wish that\
  \ I could remember the names of all the food that I had.\_ Just be adventurous and\
  \ it will be delicious.I also really loved the dried squid with chili.\nBrunei's\
  \ speak flawless English.\_ In case you forgot, Brunei used to be a British protectorate,\
  \ so not surprisingly, English is still taught in schools.\_ That said, many menus\
  \ may be in Malay, but if you ask, the locals are happy to help.\nFrom the top of\
  \ the slightly terrifying canopy bridge not for those with a fear of heights. you\_\
  an see rainforest for miles.\nYou\u2019ll find hotel prices in Brunei similar to\
  \ prices in Singapore although hotel prices were surprisingly high. If you\u2019\
  re coming from Malaysian Borneo, the hotel prices that are generally higher than\
  \ $50.\_ Homesteads are catching on within Brunei, so consider doing a homestay\
  \ if you want to experience a bit beyond the hotel.\n\nKampong Ayer water village\
  \ is a fully functional village on stilts and it\u2019s not just for tourists; people\
  \ actually live there. I have no idea how it\u2019s not a UNESCO attraction, but\
  \ I suspect that it might become one in the future.\_ See it before the rest of\
  \ the world discovers it."
