Text: "When we went on our trip to Seattle, the first real trip that we had ever been\
  \ on together, I expected to find beauty and adventure. One thing I didn't expect\
  \ to find though was so many people with so many big dreams. I had always thought\
  \ that I was the only one stuck in this huge world with dreams of something different.\
  \ That is until I started talking to people all through our trip. \n\nThere were\
  \ people at the music festival that we went to that had grand dreams, dreams that\
  \ you wouldn't think you would find in a group of the worlds misfits. Dreams of\
  \ world travel, going to fancy colleges, and find jobs that made them happy. That's\
  \ not where it ended though, every place that we visited through the trip there\
  \ were people with a dream. The artist on the boardwalk who dreamed of becoming\
  \ a famous painter and the people working at the museum dreamed of finishing school\
  \ and moving up in the world. \n\nThrough all of the dreams that I saw there was\
  \ one particular dreamer that stood out the most. One person whose story will stay\
  \ with me for the rest of my life. I met a homeless man who was creating the most\
  \ amazing artwork on the side of the street. We stopped and talked to them for some\
  \ time and learned all about his story. He was so honest about the problem that\
  \ he suffered with, his homelessness and drug abuse, but he was also so honest about\
  \ the dreams that he had and the passions that he followed. He told us that he always\
  \ wanted to be an artist but when he started down a bad path that dream fell away.\
  \ \n\nHe sat there telling us about how we need to take every moment in our life\
  \ and make it the best that we can. This man who had clearly lost so much wanted\
  \ to leave us with a positive impact, he wanted to change how we saw the world.\
  \ He wasn't afraid of how we saw him and he didn't need any gratification, he just\
  \ wanted to make the world a better place. So now, every single time I look at this\
  \ makes artwork that hangs on my wall I am reminded that I need to fight for my\
  \ dreams because even if everything seems at it's worst I know that there is always\
  \ a reason to keep trying. \n\nI will always be grateful for that trip to Seattle,\
  \ it gave me more than I could have ever asked for. It gave me the courage to do\
  \ things I was scared to find something greater. It allowed me to see people in\
  \ a different light, to not judge people by the places they are or the journey they\
  \ have walked. Most of all I learned that I wanted to see more of the world and\
  \ meet more amazing people that will change my life forever!"
