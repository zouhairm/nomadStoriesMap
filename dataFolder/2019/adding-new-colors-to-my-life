Text: "Passion of learning, hunger of travelling, deep urge of adventure, taste of\
  \ exploring. These were what led to push me to buy my interrail ticket. As known,\
  \ you will never know what to face what to experience what to find during your trip.\
  \ It was totally same for me. Day by day my satisfaction about my trip around the\
  \ Europe was rising. The other way round; my blindness, stolidity, belatedness were\
  \ going down. I had been feeling my vision was expanding. Obviously, it was related\
  \ to number of borders that I passed and length of railways I took. The more country\
  \ the broader my mind! And my mind reached its west border in Amsterdam.\n\nThe\
  \ image of Amsterdam; canals, streets with full of bicycles, cannabis, parks which\
  \ contain every shades of green, red light, diversity of museums and freedom. These\
  \ are the things that everyone envisions when the topic is Amsterdam. I would say;\
  \ so true but so incomplete.\n\nIf you are living in a country like Turkey, everywhere\
  \ seems close to you; however, everything that everywhere contains seems to be very\
  \ far away. Such as modernity, human rights, animal rights, justice, the regard\
  \ of homosexuality and so on. In my country, respect to homosexuality and awareness\
  \ of \u2018gay people can exist\u2019 are in the way that restricted water in a\
  \ desert, a few diamond in quarry, pandas in nature. Thus, I can basically confess\
  \ that I have never seen neither a diamond in quarry nor a panda in my native land.\
  \ The first splash of water in my \u2018desert mind\u2019 dribbled in Amsterdam.\
  \ There, I coincidently attended Gay Pride. Thanks to my luck, the period that I\
  \ was in Amsterdam was the most colorful time of the city. Everywhere had covered\
  \ with rainbow flags, everybody had worn colorful clothes and they had painted their\
  \ body. The city was as gaudy as a butterfly. Besides these physically colorfulness,\
  \ Amsterdam was also mentally in that way. I saw; grannies who were holding hands,\
  \ black boy and white boy were cohering when they were dancing, the disabled gay\
  \ couple who were the subsidiaries of each other. One was the eyes of both and the\
  \ other one was the legs of both.  Scale was so large, various, colorful and free.\
  \ No age, no race, no ethnicity, no nationality, just love! Love is something pure\
  \ and simple. That\u2019s all. All the wars, intolerance, jealousy, dissensions\
  \ are coming from lack of love. I was so amazed that all of these problems have\
  \ a solution which is really easy to do. In my country, I have raised with a lot\
  \ of problems such as terror, politics and homicides. Everybody said, reasons of\
  \ these difficulties are hate but nobody said solution is just love. I repeated\
  \ to myself for several times \u2018\u2019Solitude has covered the whole world.\
  \ To love, everything begins with love to person.\u2019\u2019 from one of my favorite\
  \ author Sait Faik. I deeply felt that quote. In our daily life we are using the\
  \ word of love very frequently. However, we do not really feel and fill its meaning.\
  \ I believe that now I comprehend it, very much.\n\n In that period of my travel,\
  \ Amsterdam was kind of utopia for me. I left behind conflicts, hurly-burly, chaos\
  \ in Turkey and Amsterdam literally helped me to remove curtain on my eyes. Thus,\
  \ I have started to see all colors in the world. That little splash turned into\
  \ an oasis in my desert mind. I hope step by step desert will replace with fertile\
  \ soil. In that point, as can be imagined, it is difficult not to speak in superlatives\
  \ when depicting Amsterdam. The best destination I reached the first enlightenment\
  \ movement for me and the most amazing adventure place I have been."
