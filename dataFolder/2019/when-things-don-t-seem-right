Text: "In 2015 I took a journey into the unknown in Far East Asia,\nIt was a journey\
  \ with less expectations and I was wowed with all I got, \u201CI found love in Asia\u201D\
  \ I found the most special woman and fell in love with the islands the lovely waters\
  \ in Boracay, El nido and Palawan...\n   It was a whole new experience with the\
  \ different food, language, hospitality and the journey into the unknown.\nAt First\
  \ it wasn\u2019t easy to cope because of the adaptation process wasn\u2019t easy,\
  \ it was a complete opposite to where I came from and what I had dreams for, first\
  \ we got a family who were a support to us as a church and helped in our adaptation\
  \ and transformation into \u201CAsians\u201D.\nWe also joined a group of Africans\
  \ in a church group called International Cell Fellowship( ICF) where we did all\
  \ we could to make everything to make each other feel at home.\nIn 2016 we started\
  \ doing charity at a small island in pugaro,\nWhere there were few Christians and\
  \ we did all with charity and spreading of the word...\nIn 2017 I had the chance\
  \ of going to see the country; majorly the islands in Pangasinan. Now I am determined\
  \ to travel around the country to be able to visit tourist destinations in Europe,\
  \ South America and more places in Asia.\nI would be happy to get this opportunity"
