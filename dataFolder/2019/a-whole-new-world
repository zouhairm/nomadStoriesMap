Text: "It all began with a romance. Two young people hopelessly in love separated\
  \ by traditions and life experiences. Meeting her was the most crazy, unknown and\
  \ life changing experience of my life. I already lived an exhilarating life as a\
  \ Firefighter/ Paramedic. Before I met Isabel, I was a typical American guy in his\
  \ 20s. I celebrated the 4th of July and dreamt of the \"American Dream\" of owning\
  \ a house with the iconic white fence.\n\nIt wasn't until I met Isabel, did I realize,\
  \ that would become one of the most life changing and heart breaking moments of\
  \ my life. She was from Germany and was in America as an Au Pair. Until I met her\
  \ I never really knew what life was outside of being an American. Of course we learn\
  \ about history, but I had never experienced someone that grew up in a completely\
  \ different country even though my parents were not born in the States. \n\nFrom\
  \ her I learned that there are different ways people are taught, how groceries and\
  \ food was different. I even began night classes to learn German. Life was bliss\
  \ for that year until she had to return back to her hometown in Germany. It was\
  \ heart breaking, but we were determined to see if we could make it work. It wasn't\
  \ till later in the year that I realized that it would be my first time I was on\
  \ an airplane since I was a little boy, let alone flying across the world to a different\
  \ country. \n\nRight off the bat as soon as we left US airspace I was offered beer\
  \ or my choice of alcohol in German, and no one asked me what my age was. Right\
  \ there and then I knew I was going into something different. When I landed in Munich\
  \ I was awe struck. I never really knew what to think as far as another countries\
  \ airport, but I realized that it was no different than the one I flew out of.\n\
  \nAs I spent the month in Germany I realized one thing that stuck out like a sore\
  \ thumb. Life here was no different than the life I lived back in the States. Sure\
  \ the people were slightly different and I didn't quite understand what they said,\
  \ but the daily routine and how they went about their day was exactly the same.\
  \ I was so intrigued. \n\nLong story short, we lasted another year, and in that\
  \ year we realized that it just couldn't work so we decided to travel for a month\
  \ and a half together, and visited Japan. It was a life changing experience to see\
  \ and feel that excitement with someone else, living out of a bag and not knowing\
  \ anything together. It was amazing. After we returned back to Germany and I spent\
  \ my remaining days with her and her family. I sadly and reluctantly left. I could\
  \ remember her standing there as I walked through the security doors as she ran\
  \ away crying. \n\nIts still a memory that is engraved in my mind. We still talk\
  \ and she keeps up with my travels as I never forgot the excitement of our travels\
  \ together in Japan. Since then I have traveled most of Europe and SE Asia as well\
  \ as other local areas in the states with each experience bringing me back to the\
  \ blissful days and the excitement like I felt in Germany and Japan. \n\nI live\
  \ for the travel and I love to photograph and share my adventures with friends and\
  \ family. I have made many friends along my travels and plan for visits. I no longer\
  \ dream of the house with the white fence. Instead I dream of a backpack, and a\
  \ hostel, sharing stories with new found friends from all over the world. I feel\
  \ like this is just another chapter in my book and I cant wait to see where this\
  \ book leads. For now I have it book marked just waiting to picked up again. A leap\
  \ into the unknown."
