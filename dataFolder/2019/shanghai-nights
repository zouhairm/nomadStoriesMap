Text: "By 7:00am it was already hot, and the heavy humid air pressed down on me, making\
  \ my thin cotton dress cling to my body. Though my eyes were still blurry with sleep\
  \ deprivation my head spun like a clown\u2019s in those carnival games, as I tried\
  \ to take it all in. Shanghai is a collision of cultures, of the old and the new,\
  \ and there is always something different to look at. I walked with a group of people\
  \ from university. The fifteen of us chatted, already forgetting we had been strangers\
  \ a couple of days ago. We spoke openly of our plans for the future, our fears,\
  \ the hurdles we had faced both in university and in our personal lives. Before\
  \ 9:00am we had divulged more secrets between us than most friends do in a lifetime.\n\
  \nAfter the morning classes were over we each went our separate ways, before reuniting\
  \ for an evening meal. Dinner was always an occasion in Shanghai. With a handful\
  \ of Chinese words between us, and a lot of hand gesturing, we would find a restaurant\
  \ with pictures on the menu (a life saver in China) and sit down to an exotic meal.\
  \ Unlike the rushed dinners I\u2019d grown accustomed to, there were no distractions.\
  \ There was no T.V in the background, I wasn\u2019t finishing my weekly readings\
  \ between bites. It was just us and the food. We laughed as we dared one another\
  \ to take a bite of snake or jellyfish, we laughed at our own anxieties - even if\
  \ we weren\u2019t ready to let them go. And for what felt like the first time in\
  \ my life I simply ate my dinner and enjoyed the company of others.\n\nOne night\
  \ our party separated as some headed back to their rooms and others went in search\
  \ of the perfect view on The Bund. Five of us decided to explore the idyllic streets\
  \ of the French Concession, which would have looked more appropriate in a Disney\
  \ film rather than sandwiched between sky rises in the cosmopolitan city. \n\nAfter\
  \ sampling blueberry wine in an old cottage, and sipping Bloody Mary\u2019s in a\
  \ beer garden we stumbled into a hole-in-the-wall kind of place. The bar was dark,\
  \ and shone with the golden hues of whiskey. Shanghai businessmen stood around their\
  \ tables, quietly talking amongst themselves, seemingly oblivious to the soulful\
  \ jazz pouring from the band on stage. The tall, dark woman swayed in time with\
  \ the saxophonist next to her, as if the three of them, woman, man and saxophone\
  \ were one entity.\n\nOur group walked into the cool darkness, our bodies still\
  \ sticky from the memory of the humid Shanghai night. We stood captivated in the\
  \ entrance, drinking in the scene, the only white people in the bar. Anna was the\
  \ first to break the spell. Her laugh bubbled in the back of her throat as she grabbed\
  \ my hand and Elizabeth\u2019s next to her and towed us to the small space in front\
  \ of the stage I guess you could call a dance floor. Her smile beamed at me through\
  \ the shadows and she danced to the music. Agnes and Pascal quickly followed. I\u2019\
  ve never been much of a dancer. Self-conscious and shy, I try to avoid it at all\
  \ costs. But the girls around me were so happy, their smiles conveyed nothing but\
  \ enjoyment and the singer was overjoyed now people were actually listening to her.\
  \ My mouth cracked into a natural smile, and I realised I was having fun. I was\
  \ dancing and I was enjoying it. The band transitioned from one song to another\
  \ and the woman called down to us, applauding our carefree nature. A handful of\
  \ men at the tables closest to us had broken away from their business talk and began\
  \ to sway on the sidelines of the dance floor. Before long the tiny space was crowded\
  \ with people dancing together. Even then it felt surreal. There, in the most chaotic\
  \ of places, in the French concession of a Chinese city, with my Australian classmates,\
  \ listening to an American jazz band, I belonged."
