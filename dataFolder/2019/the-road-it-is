Text: "I haven't travel that much. I have to be honest at start. Well, not outside\
  \ of Greece that is. Recently I got on a train and made alll the way to cold Florina.\
  \ Not to be confused with Florida. Florina is on of the coldest, if not the coldest\
  \ herself, city in Greece. It can get to -25C, and for Greece, thats a lot. Or too\
  \ little. Depends how you see it. Getting there, I had a 'job' exams for Univercity.\
  \ I would give my best during the days and walk around the new to me city at nights.\
  \ (My insomnia helped me a bit on that.)\nLest's fast forward to today. About six\
  \ months later, I am just starting my second semester on that very same university.\
  \ I am making my hopes come true by studying Visual and Applied Arts. It seems like\
  \ I am going to be doing this for the next five years, I need to complete ten semester\
  \ succesfully to get my degree. Though this process though I had discovered more.\
  \ The train that braught me where I am and the train that bring me back home to\
  \ see family and friends. I though I would go on months without visiting. Yet I\
  \ found myself going back every couple of weeks or so. Then it stopped being just\
  \ the place where I am from. I would get off the train in different places. I would\
  \ tell myself that it's about seeing an old friend, attenting an even, seeing art\
  \ exhibition. I did all that. But I would find myself alone. I always liked being\
  \ along but I was never confident enough to do it somewhere I hadn't been before.\
  \ I think I was slowly getting there. I AM slowly getting there. Eventually, I realise\
  \ how much time I would spent on the train. Reading, listening to music, helping\
  \ people that didn't seem to know much about it. Then, it hit me. I was helping\
  \ others, it must've meant that I knew a bit myself too, right? It surely did the\
  \ trick. I started taking notes on my sketch books. I guess they aren't just sketch\
  \ books anymore. I would even add some bits of those notes on my DaDa poems. It's\
  \ makes me feel great. It makes me want to be able to write down my experiences\
  \ more. I wanna learn how to do it better. Most of all, for me, for the feeling\
  \ that it gives me. I want to get the train, or the plane, the ship, the bus and\
  \ go anywhere. Or better, everywhere. I wanna see it then write about it, maybe\
  \ add a little drawing on the side. \nI love Art school, I will always do. But just\
  \ classrooms and walls aren't enough. Realising how much this little trips inspired\
  \ me was beyond this life for me.   I always loved reading ever since my grandma\
  \ teached me how, when I was four. For years I would think about writing something\
  \ myself. I would love to do so. I will do so. I haven't travel much. But right\
  \ now, I'm more than ready to do so."
