Text: "New... naw... now... Now, what was the name of the town again? I stroll past\
  \ a bottle shop, with the sign, Nuorgam Alkoholi\u2014 Nuorgam! That\u2019s the\
  \ name of this untidy sprawl, with zero hope of transport out until the Spring thaw,\
  \ when \u2014 so I\u2019ve had been told by Seppo, the host of my airB&B \u2014\
  \ I could catch the twice-weekly ride on the Summer Bus \u201Cright from your door!\u201D\
  \ and be deposited in Bergen, the forested home of my favourite composer, Edvard\
  \ Grieg, via a breathtaking sweep around verdant fjords. I stop, apply lanolin to\
  \ chapped lips, shiver, and start strolling again; this time at a faster pace, and\
  \ before long, the track drops into a valley where the Tana river can be seen; a\
  \ strip of phlegmatic yellow and bordered with picnic tables and gas barbecues,\
  \ in readiness for the seasonal fishers swarming in from the South to hook fat salmon\
  \ for outdoor cooking while imbibing mouth-biting spirits\u2014 I pass the pub as\
  \ the door bangs open, releasing a parcel of stale, sausage-scented air plus a red-cheeked\
  \ man, fumbling with a lighter \u2014 look out! he cries \u2014 I sidestep a potentially\
  \ spine-jangling puddle of oil and send him a distracted wave of thanks, having\
  \ just realised I\u2019ve walked much further than intended, having only passed\
  \ this way once before when dawn-drowsy on the bus and shaken from nineteen near\
  \ misses with reindeer on the road when travelling from Rovaniemi (the home of Santa,\
  \ no less!), where I visited the underground museum, featuring the wondrous accoutrements\
  \ of the Inuits \u2014 bows and arrows, bone flutes and zithers, hide drums, tents\
  \ and canoes \u2014 cunningly positioned beside skeletons of bears and moose; the\
  \ looming animal presence providing a sharp emphasis to the miracle of human survival\
  \ for eons in a frozen desert of snow\u2014 hey, the man calls, hey, come in, and\
  \ I\u2019ll buy you a drink \u2014 I toss him a closed smile, to signify I\u2019\
  m appropriately stranger-friendly as befits a traveller passing through (or trapped,\
  \ in my case) but not friendly-friendly... continue walking and\u2014 \n\nWow! \n\
  \nThe dark clouds have parted for the first time since I have arrived, the silvery\
  \ sun revealing a magical landscape of a million different hues of blue, mauve and\
  \ purple. I recall how the Inuits have many words for snow. By golly, they must\
  \ have umpteen words for colours...\n\nOn a soft sigh of wind, a flutter of wings,\
  \ I\u2019m blown from the present into the past: I can hear the beat of a drum,\
  \ the trill of a flute, the laboured breath of a monstrous beast being hunted and...\
  \ \n\nFootsteps? \n\nI turn and cop a malevolent blast of cigarette smoke and spittle.\n\
  \nThe man from the pub is standing behind me. \n\nHe screams, \u201CNarttu! Lutka!\
  \ Prostituoitu! Huora! Kusip\xE4\xE4! H\xE4py! Naida!\u201D"
