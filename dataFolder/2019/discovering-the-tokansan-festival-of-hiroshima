Text: "Colorful kimonos flying in the streets, signal the eminent\_Tokansan festival\_\
  that takes place in the city of Hiroshima.\_Enryujitemple lights mark the reassuring\
  \ presence of summer that begins. Hiroshima, a city so naturally tranquil rebuilt\
  \ after so much suffering has been celebrating\_for\_400 thousand years, the beginning\
  \ of June. At the approach of summer one of these 3 major festivals takes place,\
  \ the\_Tokansan\_festival. The celebration also called\_Yukata\_festival, indicates\
  \ to the Japenese the first day they have to wear the\_Yukata.\_Summer kimono of\
  \ lightweight cotton\_like a summer robe. Only at the\_Enryuji\_Temple at the end\
  \ of\_Chuo-Dori\_Avenue, constructed in the 1600s, that the thoughts are ordered.\
  \ Western values, which until then animated the behavior of the Japanese, fade away.\
  \ And it\u2019s the light of the lanterns, which above our heads, indicates, the\
  \ path of prayers to\_Touka Daimyoujin\_for good fortune. Religious rituals are\
  \ always very present with Japanese of all ages.\nI left the hotel on the sly to\
  \ take possession of the festive streets. Although quite small, the city of Hiroshima\
  \ shows us the way with many red flags, to his high place of festivities,\_Chuo-Dori\_\
  Avenue. Even familiar with Japanese culture, the Westerner who likes me enters the\
  \ street for the first time receives a shock. His vision of Japan changes.\_From\
  \ noon until 11 pm, locals who come with friends or family will go back to the traditions\
  \ and wear the famous\_Yukata\_I mentioned above.\_Through the street food stalls\
  \ and gaming booths, the Japanese will move slowly, cautiously choosing their way\
  \ among the thousands of people who invade the street. From time to time, the smells\
  \ of grilled cuttlefish, kebabs, oysters or the famous rolled Okonomiyaki, will\
  \ tempt your taste buds. Pilgrims will also spend their time playing typical Japanese\
  \ games, such as goldfish scooping, ball fishing etc\u2026 They walk along the stalls\
  \ animated by drinks in amazing colors, blue, yellow or bright red in a glass bulb.\
  \ They greet the musicians and singers with\_the traditional voice and music\_that\
  \ bring inside them this Japan never forgotten. And they smile to the girls who\
  \ will take their offerings of 300-1000 yen in exchange for a\_yakuyoke uchiwa\_\
  fan. Fans that are the personification of\_Touka Daimyoujin\_herself, and the most\
  \ effective talisman against misfortune, I'll probably need one to keep me safe\
  \ during my journey. \nHere I am back in this hidden kingdom of traditional Japan\
  \ which weaves in me a web of questions. Over the years,\_so much contrast\_between\
  \ the still present tradition and an ultra-modern culture has allowed this country\
  \ a world\u2019s interests. To try to unravel the mystery of the country\u2019s\
  \ fascination, the\_Tokansan\_festival is a good way. The Japanese will trade their\
  \ jeans and t-shirt for the traditional kimono. The hurried traveler will be able\
  \ to be satisfied with\_3 days of festivities\_which in the evening will turn the\
  \ city into a real anthill. Because if the party starts at noon, and the street\
  \ closes its access to the car from 7:30 am, it\u2019s really in the evening that\
  \ everything really begins. A Buddhist country, Japan has many religious festivals\
  \ where locals bend to customs while adding their touch of modernity. To enter the\
  \ bazaar of\_Chuo-Dori\_Avenue\_with the pilgrims who flock in the evening is not\
  \ an easy task. Some of them took the train for the pleasure of joining the party.\
  \ As for the sun, it has taken possession of the horizon, now allows the Japanese\
  \ to lower the parasols or umbrellas, and take full control of the site, guided\
  \ by\_the\_Enryuji\_temple. The animation rises with the twilight. And the Tokansan\
  \ festival will prevent us from thinking about this foreign next day. The Japanese\
  \ ravish us in their summer kimonos as rolled in sheets of rice paper. When we Westerners\
  \ ask all kinds of naive questions, like children. Is it really the same Japan as\
  \ during the day? As they usually wear that every day?\_\nKingdom of the kimonos,\
  \ fragile miracle, on which watch the protecting divinity of good fortune,\_Touka\
  \ Daimyoujin."
