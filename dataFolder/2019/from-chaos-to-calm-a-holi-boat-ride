Text: "At 6am, dazed from an overnight train ride, we hoisted our backpacks onto our\
  \ stiff bodies and sauntered away from the train station into the bright, arid morning.\
  \ We recognized a fellow traveler a few meters away; we had met him when we slept\
  \ in the Thar Desert the week before. He joined our trio, and we all piled into\
  \ the nearest rickshaw for a ride into Varanasi\u2014the spiritual capital of India\u2014\
  on the morning of Holi. \n\nAs our driver navigated the dusty streets, my senses\
  \ tried in vain to keep up. The outskirts of Varanasi were dotted with sun-faded\
  \ buildings and pedestrians whose clothes and faces were dyed with vivid colors\
  \ for the Hindu celebration of spring. Even after 2 months in India, the population\
  \ size still shocked me. Every bystander followed us with inquisitive eyes as we\
  \ sped past. Calls of celebration traveled through the air adding to the noise of\
  \ perpetually-honking vehicles and our sputtering rickshaw. Beads of sweat formed\
  \ on my skin.\n\nThe thrill of Holi was palpable as we neared the center. Each time\
  \ our rickshaw clunked to a stop, a swarm of brightly-dyed young men, intoxicated\
  \ with Holi spirit, charged toward our open-air vehicle. Unsure if the groups threatened\
  \ or welcomed us, we held onto our backpacks as people reached toward us with colour-stained\
  \ hands. To our relief, most interactions were exhilarating. Strangers splattered\
  \ us with paint, marking an invitation to celebrate. Our white outfits and skin\
  \ became more colorful as the journey continued.\n\nSteering through the sea of\
  \ painted humans, our driver parked near our destination. The crowds were too dense\
  \ to offer door-to-door service. The atmosphere buzzed ominously in congested streets\
  \ where men drank from plastic cups and threw colored substances at one another.\
  \ My instinct informed me to proceed with caution. We had not seen any women, foreign\
  \ or local, since the train station. With backpacks on again, we pushed through\
  \ the commotion toward our guesthouse, maintaining a formation in which we (the\
  \ two females) were most protected.\n\nThe noticeably inebriated owner of our guesthouse\
  \ was unimpressed by our scheduled arrival. We had a choice: wait in the inhospitable\
  \ guesthouse until the crowds subsided or assume the risk of exploring straightaway.\
  \ Choosing the latter, we left our backpacks to wander Varanasi unencumbered. Proud\
  \ of the colors we had acquired since the train station, we did not wash up. We\
  \ looked like the entertainment from a 5-year-old\u2019s birthday party, but so\
  \ did everyone else.\n\nWe wandered east with no destination in mind. Shoulder to\
  \ shoulder, we embraced the afternoon heat intensified by the lack of personal space.\
  \ Varanasi\u2019s main street narrowed to a bottleneck then widened onto the Ghats,\
  \ the series of steps leading into the Ganges River. The divine sight stunned me\u2014\
  I stopped to breathe.\n\nWe walked south along the Ghats, captivated by the expanse\
  \ of the city built on the Ganges. Boats with chipping paint lined the shore. A\
  \ man with a generous splash of fuchsia across his shirt, neck and chin offered\
  \ us a boat ride. \n\n\u201CYes,\u201D we replied without conferring. Overtired\
  \ and overwhelmed, we all wished for a reprieve from the Holi chaos. The sun moved\
  \ slowly west.\n\nWe boarded a white and orange wooden boat with \u201CState Bank\
  \ of India\u201D painted across the side. The captain rowed further from the shore\
  \ allowing us to observe the chaos of Varanasi from a distance. We took pictures\
  \ and made jokes, as travelers are inclined to do, but I took a moment for myself\
  \ and sat cross-legged on the bow. Everyone in the boat fell silent, each of us\
  \ entranced by wonder.\n\nI sat on the edge of the boat, deep in the magic of the\
  \ moment, and watched the aftermath of Holi unfolding on the Ghats. The sun set\
  \ behind the crumbling buildings and tinted the cloudless sky with the same pastel\
  \ hues of the city itself. Our boat floated calmly on the murky waters of the holiest\
  \ river in the world. Time lost meaning as we settled into tranquility. \n\nOur\
  \ western na\xEFvet\xE9 had brought us to Varanasi on the morning of Holi. One day\
  \ wiser, I had learned that chaos and calm coexist."
