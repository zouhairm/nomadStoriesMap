Text: "The resort had been the only ski/snowboard lodge in Lesotho and one of just\
  \ two in Southern Africa. There was word that it was home to an annual music and\
  \ ski festival too. Once I heard that the only sensible actions were to pack my\
  \ friends for the entertainment and our Jagermeister for the cold and drive 12 hours\
  \ North East from Cape Town. \nDelayed gratification was the name of the game with\
  \ a 4am arrival in the dark cold. We crawled into 4 bunk bed pods in anticipation\
  \ of warmth and stationary sleep and, most of all, the landscape that waited to\
  \ reveal itself in daylight.\n\nA white tongue stuck out in the soft brown of the\
  \ mountains which turned out to be the manufactured ski slopes - a result of spring\
  \ coming early to the Maloti Mountains this year. The four of us quickly let go\
  \ of any disappointment in the lack of authentic powder and moved to the festival\
  \ rhythm. Pick a snowboard and join a free lesson. Up the slope holding onto an\
  \ unsteady cable. Down the slope on a board. Bail onto knees. Music break. Food\
  \ and drink break. Back on the slope. Nightly after-party at the bar.\n\nThe jig\
  \ continued over the next day and a half, each of us collecting skills, new friends\
  \ and favourite warm apres-ski tipples at the bar. Before anyone knew it we had\
  \ hit the final night where the music and the party stayed outdoors and we were\
  \ in for a show to end all others.\nHolding up torches in a line of fire, draped\
  \ in traditional Basotho blankets and faces part-concealed with mokorotlo, traditional\
  \ conical hats, our former ski and snowboard instructors suddenly cut through the\
  \ darkness down the slope and congregated around the fire pit in a flurry of whistles.\
  \ \nWhat ensued was explained to us as the \u2018burning of the skis\u2019 ceremony,\
  \ a customary spectacle to end ski weekends the world over, followed by a \u2018\
  snow-making chant\u2019 as a last appeal to gods for some real powder. Only this\
  \ was the mountain kingdom of Lesotho and festivities were adjusted accordingly\
  \ as they had been all weekend. Thus the dancing began, part fire-poi performance,\
  \ part haka, part Hollywood spell.\nIt all came to a head when the head chanter\
  \ held up his last ski to add it to the fire pit and declared, \u201CTo Winterfest!\u201D\
  \ which elicited the intended roar and ululation from the crowd and cued the DJ\
  \ to restart his music. We toasted our drinks all around with a cheer and looked\
  \ above to welcome a cool breeze and even a few drops of precipitation on our faces.\n\
  \n\u201CAmazing how high the snow machine shoots, look at that\u201D, Rick marvelled\
  \ at the strobe lights that revealed artificial snow falling in the rotating illuminated\
  \ beams. \nOnly I looked all around and where there was light or a surface, there\
  \ was a silvery layer of white. We left the stage area and walked up the slight\
  \ slope to the restaurant and it didn\u2019t seem to end. Light ice flakes from\
  \ our noses to where the eye couldn\u2019t see any more.\nAt morning light as though\
  \ it had been a vivid dream, the ground was brown and hard again as we packed the\
  \ car, feeling a little worse for wear after a few days of beginner snowboarding\
  \ and high-altitude partying. No chat on the drive back home could live up to the\
  \ experience really, so in all our minds it stayed."
