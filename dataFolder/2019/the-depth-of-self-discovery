Text: "usually most traveling stories are about traveling to another country and learning\
  \ about their lifestyle and culture , my travel story is a bit unique , firstly\
  \  i would like to start by saying if it wasn't  for my country my passion for writing\
  \ would be dead. South Africa we dont call it rainbow nation for jokes , it is quiet\
  \ of a handful country ,all sorts different cultures and different lifestyles in\
  \ one country combined together as one ,ive  never seen such  beauty  , my travel\
  \ experience has not been an easy one because of lack of funds to travel from city\
  \ to city , but my passion and desires to write new and fresh stories drove me to\
  \ travel against all odd . Cape Town, Johannesburg,Bloemfontein,Limpopo, a diverse\
  \ country filled with people willing to work together within the differences to\
  \ create one country. Zulu , Pedi, Sotho,Venda, Afrikaans , all add up to 11 official\
  \ languages recognized in a single country that alone is a huge something to keep\
  \ me on my toes about my country , we dont celebrate one culture we celebrate a\
  \ pack of culture yet we are one . was able to fully understand my countries strengths\
  \ and weaknesses   , the different departments in action , education, sports, health,\
  \ and how they operate , like i said my country is a handful one.\n\nsouth Africa\
  \ is a typical country where every citizen is on the edge of their seat , trying\
  \ to make it in all industries, Corporate, Entertainment, Sports Beauty , some like\
  \ me betting everything to crack the Writing industry , its not entirely a fair\
  \ game at times but we have to keep moving , chasing deadlines and trends .\n\n\
  My love for Travel writing is so interesting that not a lot of people can relate\
  \ to my lifestyle and way of doings, i am a go getter , focused, determined , i\
  \ write with creativity and art inspired by my country , a country of creativity\
  \ in its people and the art by the people . South Africa is a wonderful country\
  \ that need an open minded person to understand it . My country gave me so much\
  \ hope that there is a lot to explore and write about that there is light at the\
  \ end of the tunnel . \n\nAttractions and heritage sited to remind us about our\
  \ roots and were we come from , what our people went to to archive a diversified\
  \ country South Africa is today .\n\nDiscovering all about my country was never\
  \ really about the country i was about me , getting to understand parts about myself\
  \ that i realized they were there , more about me , more to write about , more to\
  \  think about  , there is more  , more to explore .\n\nIf i win the scholarship\
  \ not only will i be able explore Portugal but i will also explore another part\
  \ of my self discovery journey."
