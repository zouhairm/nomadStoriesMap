Text: "I grew up in the middle of nowhere on a farm in Ohio and unlike many in the\
  \ area I was touched with the wanderlust gene. I always wondered what was the next\
  \ township over yonder was like, then the next county, the next State and so on.\
  \ My travels had taken me across America more times than I can count. By train,\
  \ auto, hitch-hiking, and my favorite, by bicycle. It was never the destination\
  \ but rather the journey that drove me, literally, down the unbeaten path and across\
  \ the fields. It was not the transport across the Country, but rather the transformation\
  \ one undergoes while doing so that was the attraction.  \nHaving exhausted many\
  \ vehicles while driving too many miles it was only natural that I turn towards\
  \ another country.  The first time I set foot out of America it was onto the streets\
  \ of Paris where I am sure I was an awestruck/ah shucks site for the natives. Conquering\
  \ Europe by train and foot only added to the wonder. \nThe desire to do good work\
  \ while I was traveling was only natural to me. I was humbled by my view of the\
  \ genocide of Rwanda, the brutality of the Congo, the abject poverty in Uganda,\
  \ yet, I still possessed a desire to try and make a difference.  I could help and\
  \ make a difference, or I could teach others to help and make an even bigger difference.\
  \ Teaching makes a much bigger impact and continues to do so long after one is gone.\
  \ So instruction in basic healthcare, evaluations, diagnoses and treatment became\
  \ my calling card.  It opened doors throughout Sub-Saharan Africa and left me feeling\
  \ like I had at least done some small part in advancing knowledge.\n9/11 came on\
  \ a beautiful Fall day while I was in Maine. By Noon of that day I knew what it\
  \ took others a few days to realize--that the drumbeats of War were in full force\
  \ and I knew that I had to go to Afghanistan, not with the military but rather with\
  \ a humanitarian group. To this day I still believe that the surge should have been\
  \ a battalion of teachers, lawyers and civil engineers and that if this would have\
  \ occurred then we would not have failed policy that we have today.  April Fools\
  \ Day found me landing in Kandahar for what certainly must have been a fool's errand\
  \ on my part.  Self doubt set in, along with boredom of the heat and sand coupled\
  \ with the shear terror of where I was.  However, my experience teaching kicked\
  \ in and I was quickly dealing with a measles epidemic.   A few weeks with the epidemic\
  \ successfully dealt with I found myself in the local bazaar.  One man in particular\
  \ stood out by his glowing effusiveness he showed me. Apparently he recognized me\
  \ or knew of me as a teacher. I later knew him as Mohamed, but then to most Westerners\
  \ all Afghan men were ultimately named Mohamed.  He had a small store selling rugs\
  \ and pashminas. There was nothing special about his product yet I found myself\
  \ visiting on a weekly basis always haggling over the price (to do otherwise would\
  \ be an insult).  After several weeks he invited me into the shop for tea. It was\
  \ then that I truly felt blessed to have met this man. We spoke of families and\
  \ work and of our common difficulties as men. Soon the haggling over pashminas was\
  \ reversed with me saying that he was charging too little and Mohamed saying that\
  \ I was spending too much. I bought pashminas whether I needed them of not and to\
  \ this day still have a supply that I give as gifts on special occasions. Unfortunately\
  \ after 3 months the security situation was such that the shops were closed and\
  \ moved. I did not get to say my goodbyes to Mohamed but I often wonder if foreign\
  \ relations between countries might be better served by discussing concerns over\
  \ tea."
