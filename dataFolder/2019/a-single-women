Text: "Hello,\n      Myself Asma Sayed and i am an Indian with bachelor's of commerce.\n\
  \     Very exited to write a story on my visit to Dubai(UAE).\n    As my Husband\
  \ works in UAE we both decided to recide togather . I came on visit to dubai so\
  \ tat i could find a job and live a life along with him. As early morning my husband\
  \ goes to work and returns in the evening during first days it was difficult for\
  \ me to find a job by going out.\n   I was trying a lot by applying online for jobs\
  \ in indeed and dubbzile as wel. As its got 15 days o more i thaught of going out\
  \ alone and searching for a job .\n First few days to get noticed of the routes\
  \ i used to go to near by malls .\n   As days went on i got serious about my job\
  \ and as i was searching for job in schools or kindergarten i was going alone .\n\
  \   I couldn't believe people in UAE also bully a women walking .It was not so far\
  \ from my home as i was walking a man suddenly opens the door of his car in a parking\
  \ area ,i got worried how to walk from ther and there was few space remaining i\
  \ walked very fast and as i passed he started to horn i was worried i was not knowing\
  \ proper route to go back home as wel as was new to that place . And hopefully he\
  \ didn't follow me. That made me not to go out alone .\n    After few days i went\
  \ out through it and again started to go out to schools in search of job . Again\
  \ route got missed a man in car started putting horns as was walking i dint see\
  \ him , usually in Dubai without a specific reason nobody horns i din see him and\
  \ went walking as was near to my Destination he again came i front of me satrted\
  \ to talk i couldn't understand what he wanted to say and went on walking hoping\
  \ to reach the school i was wishing he wont come back of me hopefully i reached\
  \ the School and i got disappointed as there was no vacancy even there and i crossed\
  \ the road and my home was near by went back home .\n   And those who are searching\
  \ for job women specially they should be on husband or sponsored visa to get a job\
  \ easily. It was the thing i got to know after coming to dubai .\n      If v go\
  \ by walking in a city area were therz so mach crowd you will see soo many cards\
  \ down on floors and a picture of women and phone no. .As i was new first few days\
  \ i couldn't notice what was that as i walked ther on some other day again so many\
  \ were laying down there. It was bussiness tactic OMG! I couldn't believe in dubai.\n\
  \      The one who cleans the trash also keeps it aside and cleans everything else....\n\
  \nThankyou for giving an opportunity to write.\nI always wanted to be traveller\
  \ a writer and a blogger .\nThanking you\nRegards\nAsma Sayed"
