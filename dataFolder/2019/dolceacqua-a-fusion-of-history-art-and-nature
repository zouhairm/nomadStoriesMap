Text: "The beautiful Italian region of Liguria is well-known for the blue sea, for\
  \ the colourful prickly pears that ripen under the warm sun of the Riviera and for\
  \ the rocky coasts among whose cracks elegant agaves grow. Unfortunately, the Ligurian\
  \ hinterland with its villages hidden in the green valleys is often neglected. One\
  \ of these valleys is called Val Nervia which is crossed by the homonymous river\
  \ that flows to the sea through the small town of Dolceacqua.\n\nThe medieval village\
  \ located in the province of Imperia is an enchanting place halfway between coast\
  \ and mountains, past and present. Those who walk through the cobbled lanes of the\
  \ old town that meander up to the castle have the impression that time has stopped.\
  \ This idyllic atmosphere is given by the effect of the silence broken only by the\
  \ incessant flow of the river\u2019s water and the presence of the artisans\u2019\
  \ shops where the few smiling inhabitants work. They are always ready to invite\
  \ tourists to visit their laboratories as well as the cellars with the Rossese wine\
  \ which is produced by local vines. Besides getting in touch with the locals, visitors\
  \ have also the opportunity to see the remains of an ancient past like the bridge\
  \ over Nervia torrent which is a symbol of Dolceacqua. It was built in Roman times\
  \ and it seems to have just come out of a painting thanks to the evocative ruins\
  \ of the castle on the background. Also the great French artist Monet didn\u2019\
  t remain indifferent to the sight of so much beauty. That is the reason why Monet\
  \ is seen as a sort of patron of Dolceacqua. He accidentally went to the village\
  \ during one of his trips on the Riviera and fell immediately in love with the sinuous\
  \ forms of that bridge that he called \"jewel of lightness\" and he tried to represent\
  \ it several times in his works. In addition to its picturesque charm, the arched\
  \ bridge is also a crossing point that links the most characteristic and ancient\
  \ side of the historic centre to the more modern side with new houses, streets and\
  \ shops. Another place worth to see is the castle. Turned from a fortress for purely\
  \ defensive purposes into a noble residence, it was enlarged several times and changed\
  \ a lot throughout its history. Despite the fact that it was destroyed due to wars\
  \ and earthquakes it boasts today well-preserved ruins and can be visited every\
  \ day in summer.\n\nDolceacqua offers several ideas for those who want to start\
  \ excursions in touch with nature. Walk-lovers have, indeed, plenty of choice regarding\
  \ the variety and the number of trails that, passing through the village, lead to\
  \ the discovery of the hinterland. Not only on foot, but also by mountain-bike,\
  \ it is possible to appreciate the environmental heritage which consists of forests,\
  \ vineyards, streams and hills. However the best moment to visit Dolceacqua is to\
  \ go there when there is an event. It is important to mention the Feast of San Sebastiano,\
  \ when a procession is held and on this occasion a market is set up. Also the Spring\
  \ Festival is a very interesting moment when floriculture-lovers can get lost among\
  \ the colours of flowers and exposed plants. The Summer Carnival is another good\
  \ example as well as the long series of other festivals which are often animated\
  \ by a fireworks show. One of the best known is the Michetta Festival which celebrates\
  \ a typical sweet food of Dolceacqua whose legend involves the Marquis Doria, governor\
  \ of the city in the fourteenth century."
