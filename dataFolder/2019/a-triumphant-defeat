Text: "My foot was bleeding, so the injuries were against us. The stakes were high\
  \ because we hadn\u2019t eaten chocolate in a month. I couldn\u2019t take my eyes\
  \ off the dust coated football coming at me. Suman, an uneducated, age nine boy,\
  \ pushed it forward. My toe was pulsing but we had bet that three British women\
  \ could beat three Nepali boys at a game of football. Some of the Shree Pragatesheel\
  \ School kids sat at the imaginary side-lines, cheering for anyone who scored. \n\
  \nWe bet our last cartons of Lychee juice and a bulky bag of salted peanuts for\
  \ three bite sized bars of Dairy Milk. Suman\u2019s family couldn\u2019t afford\
  \ shoes so I took off and chucked my trainers to the side. I liked the feel of the\
  \ warm orange dirt beneath my feet. I felt connected to the earth when I walked\
  \ around barefoot. Though the Boretar community of Nepal looked at me as if I was\
  \ mad. Dirty feet are a sign of a good, fun day. \n\n\u201CHarry, don\u2019t take\
  \ your eyes of the ball.\u201D My dad\u2019s voice was like a cassette in my mind.\
  \ Suman kicked the ball and it soared toward the left side of me. I lunged, the\
  \ ball smacked the top of my thigh, losing my balance I fell to the floor. Suman\u2019\
  s head went down with disappointment as the next goal won. Chloe, my teammate with\
  \ small, quiet eyes, chased the ball as it rolled down one of the many hills within\
  \ the school gates. It came to a stop next to a school room with only half of one\
  \ side fully built, the other half had crumbled in the 2015 Nepal Earthquake. \n\
  \n\u201CHarry, your toe is bleeding!\u201D Clare, with dyed red hair and a Northern\
  \ Irish accent declared. She helped me up as she gulped half of her bottled water.\
  \ Immediately I looked at my foot, my blood had stained the dirty ground from orange\
  \ to brown. I licked my finger and wiped away the mess, guessing the boys playing\
  \ football and the kids on the side wouldn\u2019t even bother with a cut like this.\
  \ I couldn\u2019t stop playing because of a small hole in my toe and Clare wouldn\u2019\
  t forgive me.\n\u201CGirls, I can\u2019t run anymore. I\u2019m so unfit, please\
  \ let me guard the goal.\u201D Chloe had joined us. Clare was the polar opposite\
  \ of Chloe and I, as she outran us every morning when running in the sand next to\
  \ the sometimes beastly Sunkoshi River.\n\nOne of the players let out a sharp high-pitched\
  \ whistle, impatiently. The whispers of a plan came to me. \n\u201CChloe, kick the\
  \ ball to Clare, I\u2019ll get near the goal. Clare, I\u2019ll be open and try and\
  \ score.\u201D\nUdit, taller than the average Nepali boy, was the goal keeper. Suman\
  \ and Gautam ran forward like a small perfectly formed army. Clare had the ball,\
  \ I ran faster, getting into position. Clare and Gautam almost ran into each other,\
  \ their legs kicking frantically after the ball. It came out of their tangle, towards\
  \ me. I pushed off Suman, turned and tried to kick the ball towards the goal. In\
  \ the corner of my eye I could see Udit watching me. In an instant I realised I\
  \ didn\u2019t kick it hard enough. \n\nSuman and Gautam sprinted to the other side\
  \ of our makeshift football pitch. Before we knew it, Suman had scored the winning\
  \ goal. I went over to my water bottle, under the tree that offered the most shade.\
  \ The midday heat was beating down on us. Chloe and Clare came and sat on the floor\
  \ around me. We didn\u2019t care that our jogging bottoms would stain a little from\
  \ the dust and dirt. We didn\u2019t win the chocolate. \n\nWe got the juice and\
  \ the nuts and handed them over praising the boy\u2019s success along with the other\
  \ kids. Udit and Gautam were eating the melting chocolate, enjoying the moment,\
  \ not caring about being tired or the sun blazing down. Suman came to us with a\
  \ smile on his face, his hand went into a fist and he fist bumped us. I was proud\
  \ of our efforts, injured and tired but at least we tired."
