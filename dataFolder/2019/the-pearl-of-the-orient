Text: "The Hong Kong humidity hit them like a thick wave. The evening sun shone into\
  \ their eyes.  Streams of people passed by. He couldn\u2019t tell if it had become\
  \ harder to breathe because of the lack of space, or lack of fresh air. His hands\
  \ became clammy. His breath shortened. He began to panic. He was tempted to retreat\
  \ back into confines of the cool, air conditioned underground, but even before he\
  \ could have a second to react, she excitedly dragged his hand into the sea of human\
  \ traffic. As they began the arduous task of weaving through the masses, his ears\
  \ became filled with exploding grenades of noise. Shouting of angry citizens, honking\
  \ of cars and drilling road works beat on his ear drums, but despite the organised\
  \ chaos, they soldiered through. \n\nLooking up around him, above the crowds, were\
  \ grey forests of skyscrapers. Luxurious shops and offices became blurred into one\
  \ as the only respite from this concrete jungle were the dazzlingly lit billboards.\
  \ Advertisements of beautiful women flicking their perfect, jet black hair behind\
  \ their shoulders, smiling down with their flawless, white teeth was more than enough\
  \ to hypnotise him, but she continued to pull him further and deeper into the city.\n\
  \nSuddenly, she stopped. She admired a small street of cobbled steps that were left\
  \ behind from the British colonial times. Stone slabs mounted, unevenly on top of\
  \ each other to create a hill leading up. She thought it was interesting that even\
  \ in this modern, urban landscape, there were pockets of history that could still\
  \ be found. She turned to him, smiled and said \u201CWe\u2019re near!\u201D. They\
  \ continued until they reached a bridge above ground level. People moved across\
  \ as if they were levitating past. They walked up and with arms out wide, she exclaimed,\
  \ \u201CWelcome to the longest outdoor escalator in the world!\u201D. \n\nAs they\
  \ ascended, the buzzing of neon lights hummed like white noise, grabbing his eye\u2019\
  s attention. Restaurants with glistening meats of goose and pork hung in the windows.\
  \ The brown, crisp skin of roast poultry shone in the light while the oil dripped\
  \ down the dark, red, caramelised chunks of honey barbecued pork. Before he could\
  \ start salivating at the thought of eating, the aroma of brisket soup lured his\
  \ attention to the restaurant next door. He breathed in a perfect blend of slowly\
  \ cooked beef, green onions, garlic and pepper, almost imagining himself immersed\
  \ into a bath of broth. He so desperately wanted his tongue to experience the same\
  \ joys his other senses were. She smiled into his pining eyes and said \u201CWe\u2019\
  ll eat soon. Don\u2019t worry. The wait will be worth it.\u201D\n\n\nAs the sun\
  \ began it\u2019s retreat into darkness, they continued to summit. The blue skies\
  \ slowly fused into a deep magenta, creating folds of fuchsia against the dusky\
  \ clouds. The crowds faded and the noise quietened. They had finally reached The\
  \ Peak. A small patch of luscious greenery laid before them and a single bench was\
  \ placed in the middle of the empty space. An old gas lamp stood above, ushering\
  \ them to their seats for the show. As they sat down, he stretched his arm around\
  \ her, looked lovingly into her eyes, smiled and turned forward to admire the skyline\
  \ in front of him. A symphony of lights filled the blackness of the night. The shining\
  \ lines and dots connected with each other like a never ending scribble on a page.\
  \ Unlike the blaring static of the neon lights, these were clean dashes of colour\
  \ on a black canvas. The contrast of sitting peacefully in the park while watching\
  \ the pandemonium continue below was the respite he needed to put his initial anxieties\
  \ at rest. In a city of over seven million, crammed into four hundred square miles\
  \ of land, he certainly did not expect to find such beauty in such chaos."
