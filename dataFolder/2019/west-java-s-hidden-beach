Text: "I planned to go for a weekend getaway, so this story took place not too far\
  \ from the city I am living now which is Depok, West Java, Indonesia and it was\
  \ about 2 years ago. I went to Sukabumi, West Java, Indonesia with my significant\
  \ other just only for beach hopping. We already listed some beaches we knew from\
  \ the internet, like Cimaja Beach, Pangumbahan Beach or known as Ujung Genteng Beach,\
  \ etc. We also already read some instructions how to get there, the do's and dont's,\
  \ as well as the perfect time to go and what to do in every beach we listed. Cimaja\
  \ Beach is known for surfing and Pangumbahan Beach is known for turtle hatchlings\
  \ releasing and sunset viewing. \n\nSo we went to Cimaja Beach first to enjoy their\
  \ beach club and see people surfing as well as some local kids swimming. We did\
  \ not plan to play in this beach because there are so many rocks and big waves,\
  \ the beach club was very comfortable after all. Even though it's located very far\
  \ from the main road so we had to walk through the rice fields to the beach club,\
  \ but their food, ambiance, and service was amazing. We loved to chill on their\
  \ bean bags while enjoying the rice fields view near the beach. Even we had time\
  \ to think to stay for a night in their beach club but unfortunately we already\
  \ booked another hotel.\n\nThen we planned to move to Pangumbahan beach, but we\
  \ saw the 'Pantai Pasir Putih' (meaning White Sand Beach) signpost on our way there\
  \ and we decided to stop by since we still have some time before the hacthlings\
  \ releasing start in the Pangumbahan Beach. After some time we drove through the\
  \ forest, we thought we lost our way because there was no sign of a beach and the\
  \ road was not clear either. My significant other was hesitated at first since it\
  \ was almost time to sunset but I convinced him to keep driving and then we saw\
  \ some hut stalls running by locals so we asked them how to get to the Pasir Putih\
  \ Beach. They only pointed to a little way between one and another hut stalls. We\
  \ doubt it at first but we had no choice so we went through it. \n\nWe needed to\
  \ pass the small wooden bridge build handmade by locals, terrible swamp with so\
  \ many snake holes, and we saw some big lizards but not as big as the Komodo though,\
  \ without any guard coming with us. I mean, we were on our own, only two of us,\
  \ and of course with the living things in the swamp. I screamed loud so many times.\
  \ But it was my significant other's turn to convince me to keep walking through\
  \ the swamp. \"Do not look around, just straight, and keep walking. I will look\
  \ after you.\", He said. Isn't he sweet?\n\nSome time later, we saw something look\
  \ like a sand and then we ran rushly there to see a clear blue water ocean with\
  \ an extensive white sand view. And what makes it way more exciting was we were\
  \ there by ourselves, just the two of us, nobody else. It was like a very beautiful\
  \ private beach. After we played there and took some photos, we went back to our\
  \ car through that terrible swamp again. We almost forgot that we had another plan\
  \ waiting, which are seeing the turtle hatchlings releasing and sunset viewing in\
  \ the Pangumbahan beach.\n\nIt was fun to see the little turtle trying to go to\
  \ the ocean for the very first time and the sunset was so beautiful too, but the\
  \ journey to the Pasir Putih Beach was a blessing in disguise. From this experience,\
  \ I believe with every hardship comes ease, so there is relief. And we have to work\
  \ hard so that we can play hard. But we need to be careful because sometimes we\
  \ do not realize that time flies when we are having fun. And last but not least,\
  \ just like what Eric Thomas said, \"You have to take advantage of the opportunity\
  \ of a lifetime in the lifetime of the opportunity.\""
