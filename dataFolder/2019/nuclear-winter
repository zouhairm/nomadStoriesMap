Text: "We looked at each other in silence, feet careful not to step on the broken\
  \ glass or crunch the snow that drifted in through the broken windows. Huddled in\
  \ a small hospital room we could hear the police at the end of the corridor. I didn\u2019\
  t want to be arrested, or attempt to bribe a Ukrainian policeman. The air was stale\
  \ and damp. Breathing carefully, suddenly very aware that inhaling one particle\
  \ of radioactive material could spell the end. \n\nThis was my second day exploring\
  \ the ghost town of Pripyat in Ukraine, a victim of the infamous Chernobyl disaster.\
  \ Winter is an ideal time to visit \u2014 the snow and barren tress add to the desolate\
  \ beauty of the place. Snowdrifts pile inside broken buildings, crisp leaves and\
  \ frozen twigs add to the underfoot crunch of broken tiles and glass. The town is\
  \ slowly decaying, trees are beginning to take back the slabs of concrete, the paint\
  \ now crisp and as much on the floor as on the walls, little of value remains having\
  \ been looted over the last 33 years. Mother nature has started her own clean-up\
  \ operation. \n\nIt\u2019s rare to see a place that hasn\u2019t changed, at least\
  \ not by man, particularly one that was so proud of its modernity. Pripyat remains\
  \ frozen in time. Whilst the windows have shattered, the paint left the walls and\
  \ anything of value is long gone \u2014 nothing has been replaced. In that way,\
  \ everything is just as it was. It\u2019s all so recognisable.\n\nSomehow amongst\
  \ all this decay and mess you can see the lives that once lived there. Children\
  \ shouting in the classrooms, athletes training in the gym, couples dining in the\
  \ restaurants. This was a visionary city \u2014 one with a rosebush for each of\
  \ its 50,000 inhabitants. It was a paragon of the Communist ideal. And I could see\
  \ the appeal. I could see myself living there, heading to the restaurant for dinner\
  \ after a long week working at the power plant, pressing illuminated buttons, writing\
  \ complicated things in Cyrillic and grooming my 80s moustache. My idealistic communist\
  \ lifestyle providing everything I need in one place.\n\nI wasn\u2019t aware until\
  \ arriving that it\u2019s now illegal to enter the buildings for safety reasons.\
  \ That doesn\u2019t really stop anyone, it just creates a game of cat and mouse\
  \ with the Ukrainian police. Apparently an informal fine is enough to make the problem\
  \ go away. Still, it wasn\u2019t something I wanted to be dealing with.\n\nMy mind\
  \ was brought back into the room by a shuffling and panting coming from the corridor,\
  \ a stray dog came bouncing up to us, annoyed he would give us away I tried shooing\
  \ him silently. This just seemed to encourage him. It felt like we\u2019d lost the\
  \ game now \u2014 although it was just a dog \u2014 perhaps he\u2019d still go away.\
  \ Moments passed in absolute silence, and then of course \u2014 someone\u2019s phone\
  \ rang."
