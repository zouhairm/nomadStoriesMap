Text: "Against the cracked clay walls, topped with broken glass, I waited in my new\
  \ llama fur shirt, purchased hours prior on a tour of a mining town in the Atacama\
  \ desert. Spun from the hands of a local woman who was dusty as the street, I spent\
  \ a handful of pesos on the yellow material after realizing that my two weeks in\
  \ the northern Chilean outback were coming to a close without a souvenir. But standing\
  \ outside my hostel in the diesel stench of the road, I felt conspicuous as locals\
  \ sent me sideways glances in the setting sun, with only the stray dogs trotting\
  \ past seeming not to notice.\n\nI sipped a warm Krystal beer on the corner, watching\
  \ the dying light over the mud buildings and steel huts, as fireworks exploded somewhere\
  \ and the harsh sounds of motorbikes lit up the night. It was the last day of 2016\
  \ and my brother and his wife had left four days prior after a sudden change to\
  \ their New Years bus schedule, leaving me alone in the remote town to spend the\
  \ days on bus tours with strangers and the evenings wandering the streets with other\
  \ backpackers, eating empanadas and watching futbol in the valley.\n\nThinking of\
  \ the salty pools I had spent the afternoon at, the Cejar Lagoons that our guide\
  \ had comically enjoyed while the Germans on the tour sheepily toed the water, I\
  \ noticed a woman from the tour walking past my silhouette on the street. At first,\
  \ I hesitated, but then the loneliness of being an outsider in a foreign country\
  \ where I didn't know the language and could not drink the water got the best of\
  \ me. I reached out and patted her shoulder, shyly, not knowing if this was an absurd\
  \ act or not, whether or not I'd trigger her memory, but fortunately, I received\
  \ a smile.\n\nHi, hello, I said, then in my broken Spanish, me llamo, buenos tardes.\n\
  \nAnd she smiled, recalling my outrageous llama fur shirt I had purchased and worn\
  \ on the windy bus ride back, touching the soft material on my arm and introducing\
  \ herself as Camilla. \n\nMucho gusto.\n\nShe asked if I was alone, and I spoke\
  \ with my hands and some words, Si, si, mi hermano salgo anoche en un autobus a\
  \ Argentina, and in between our smiles and stutters and uncertainty we communicated\
  \ that she worked at another hostel and there was a party, I was invited to it,\
  \ yes and yes, I would like to go.\n\nThe streets were alive now, closer to midnight\
  \ and a new year, vibrant with the locals and backpackers alike. The tourists whisphered\
  \ excitedly and laughed quietly over sweaty beer bottles while the locals put their\
  \ straw stuffed scarecrows onto the roads, burning any back luck from the a\xF1\
  o viejo away. Camilla and I sat at the bar in her hostel, amongst ourselves like\
  \ in a sandstorm, trying to tell our stories across thousands of miles and the few\
  \ words we both understood - officina, computador, gatos, Pink Floyd. She showed\
  \ me European places on her phone where she'd been, and I pointed out on a map where\
  \ Texas was, my home, and where it was in relation to Florida, where she had distant\
  \ family in the panhandle.\n\nWhen midnight hit, Camilla and I were in a plaza older\
  \ than my home country, thousands of kilometers below the equator, champagne of\
  \ unknown origin in my hand. The cultural borderline and language barrier that timidly\
  \ separated us prevented any kind of Hollywood kiss, but the unspoken bond between\
  \ us, beneath fireworks and a night sky ablaze with constellations made this a different\
  \ kind of love story. The people in the plaza, together from across the world, as\
  \ time moved to another calendar, drunk on comradery as much as wine, insulated\
  \ us in the cool air of a desert unchanged by millennia. The rest of the moving\
  \ world, its skyscrapers and traffic, an office job with no parking, my brother\
  \ on a bus, a flight home from Santiago, all as distant as the surrounding mountain\
  \ ridges while the antique town before us waltzed to European techno music all night\
  \ on the stone streets."
