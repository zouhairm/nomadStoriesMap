Text: "Last week, the interesting things while traveling in the middle of the year\
  \ around the date of 27-30 July 2018, when I became a delegate training from Bank\
  \ Indonesia. The activities of the mine and with friends from different areas to\
  \ try to capitalize on short notice and then enjoy the feel of a night in the city\
  \ of Bandung, along with its cuisine. Because the area is famous for its cool temperatures\
  \ are cooler and have a taste of the diversity of each food.\nAnd this time at 22.15\
  \ GMT towards the middle of the night. I tried the food there is in the area. And\
  \ after finding the right one and the crowd on the edge of the city in a simple\
  \ create a vibrant State will enjoy the food and there are many other youngs enjoy.\
  \ \n\nHis unique and buffet places the term Indonesia calling people to take food\
  \ queues, and the food menu as usual i.e. Indonesia specialities such as vegetable\
  \ stir-fry long beans, boiled eggs, red rice, and simple drinks such as Ice sweet\
  \ tea, oranges and milk tea and more.\n\nAnd that time I took some menu magnitude\
  \ i.e. red rice, vegetable stir-fry Kale, boiled eggs and sweet iced tea. From the\
  \ menu I have cost RP 28,000,00 originally anyway quite passable expensive but at\
  \ the moment we've ordered and finally sat one table prepared long due to our group.\
  \ \nThen, I started tasting dish that I chose. And it was enough to make me shocked\
  \ and surprised by the hefty dishes on serve at the time of the evening, the price\
  \ is quite expensive but delicious food such as a meal at a restaurant in shades\
  \ into the city streets.\n\nStart the conversation and discussion of the various\
  \ areas of our diversity of flavors, I happened to be on the island of Sumatra is\
  \ located in the city of Palembang, and the friends I am more dominant there on\
  \ the island of Java which is quite often enjoy a night like this . I started to\
  \ react to the foods that I enjoy, \"food fair tasty and clean, if in Palembang,\
  \ there's no place like the fried food is mostly at night yesterday and it was on\
  \ my tongue which often eat spicy. It's quite sweet but delicious to taste again\
  \ \"\n\nOne of my friends answered \"seriously, meaning the right time we can spend\
  \ some time together to enjoy a meal in the evening at the roadside of Bandung city,\
  \ if there's time amassing more e.g. There is an activity or event, we can be here\
  \ again to gather and discuss the warm delicious meal. \"\nAfter enjoying a meal\
  \ accompanied with warm jokes and a discussion of laughter at that moment made me\
  \ will always remember and will never forget the atmosphere like this outside of\
  \ the city. And I never thought unimaginable and beyond my expectations regarding\
  \ food night at the side of the road is the same in every city is different.\n\n\
  This would continue with that in mind with its diversity. We can learn one thing\
  \ is being together enjoying the beauty of diversity. Travel and trip that will\
  \ share the story further nuances and broader than any thing especially in the food\
  \ section is the departure abroad i.e. Portugal. As informed and in newspapers about\
  \ those countries that have the feel of tranquility and unique buildings. Of the\
  \ things I want to try new things that haven't felt my tongue.\n\nIn the end, that's\
  \ all I can share my story for a few hours in the evening in the city of Bandung,\
  \ enjoy a meal at the roadside that makes me beyond expectations with unique and\
  \ will not be forgotten, the journey continues because that world wide with the\
  \ beauty of it."
