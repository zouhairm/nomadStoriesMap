Text: "Well, it all starts with a monotonous life cycle like every other person in\
  \ today's world. The cycle in which you get up, run for work and then again come\
  \ back home and sleep, and it goes on untill that time when it hits you so hard\
  \ on the middle of your work. Was I suppose to be here? You feel that ache in your\
  \ heart, asking yourself, Was I meant to do it? \n\nWith the same ache I asked myself\
  \ in the middle of my night shift. Was I suppose to be spending my lifetime in these\
  \ 4 closed walls. And the heart spoke, No. With the decision goes the resignation\
  \ later on the desk of my General Manager. As he checked my feedback from, there\
  \ was this answer which he could not understand where I answered, Inner Peace. The\
  \ question was, \"what I am going to get in my next job which I am not getting in\
  \ my current one?\". With that he laughed and agreed my resignation. I still had\
  \ to spend my last few days. Those last one's were the most painful as the heart\
  \ was already living the life of his dreams. As the days passed, came the last.\
  \ All I wanted to say was. \n\nI am free. \n\nMy thoughts were running wild for\
  \ the preparation I was supposed to do before leaving for my first solo trip in\
  \ the Himalayas. It was as if there was a presence who was pulling me towards it,\
  \ there was something it wanted me to feel. Eventually I started planning, watching\
  \ video on YouTube, googling all kind of safety measures, reading about the places.\
  \ I was happy. \n\nOn the February of 2018, I sat of for the trip with no fixed\
  \ number of days or the particular place to visit. It was as if that I was free,\
  \ I was a child again. The whole world was my playground. \n\nWith faith in nature\
  \ and the blessing of my loved ones. I finally started my journey. I could hear\
  \ my heart my pumping that I was actually doing it. I took a ticket for Chandigarh.\
  \ It was a 8 hour journey from Jaipur. I couldn't sleep as the excitement was rushing\
  \ throught my veins. My eyes were all over the place looking each and every detail.\
  \ I wanted to keep each and every moment of this journey as a memory to look back\
  \ and say to my self, that this made me who I am today."
