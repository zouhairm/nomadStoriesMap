Text: "As I get up from my desk after closing Paula Coelho\u2019s \u2018The Alchemist\u2019\
  , a huge crack of thunder strikes lightening up the January sky, causing me to stumble\
  \ back in my chair. I had been intrigued by the novel that I hadn\u2019t noticed\
  \ a storm had appeared after a beautiful Summer\u2019s day.\n\nWith the sound of\
  \ the rain starting to fall and the rumbles of thunder ripping through the sky,\
  \ I am reminded of a sleepless night I had during my trip to the Cambodian Jungle.\
  \ It was there, in the protected rainforest, I had my first experience of a real\
  \ tropical storm.\nI live in a country where we have incredible storms that fill\
  \ our harsh landscapes, yet this was something I had never experienced before; fierce\
  \ and ferocious like the animals that were out beyond the sanctuary. That memorable\
  \ night, lightening blinded the sky, thunder roared through the acres of trees,\
  \ and rain fell like a gushing waterfall.\n\nTonight, as the rain is falling outside\
  \ my window, the memories of this night start to flood back to me. I remember the\
  \ excitement I had for my extraordinary volunteering trip at an ethical sanctuary\
  \ that helps rescued elephants who have spent years in tourism. This sanctuary was\
  \ about preserving elephants in their natural habitat. \n\nI knew we would be assisting\
  \ these elephants, but what I didn\u2019t recognise is this adventure would also\
  \ change my life. My views shifted, and with daily tasks around the sanctuary to\
  \ help the elephants thrive, it opened my mind to the possibility of how I can help\
  \ animals. This trip was something unique, with the purpose of being there for an\
  \ animal mission. \n\nI remember vividly the very next day, the start of our journey.\
  \ That morning as the sun rose, before trekking through the depths of the rainforest,\
  \ we ate a delicious breakfast full of fresh local fruits; rich in colour as it\
  \ was sweet in taste. \nTackling the humidity of the Cambodian air as we trekked\
  \ into the rainforest deep into the unknown, we walked down a pathway to turn into\
  \ an open space, and suddenly out of nowhere, an elephant emerged. I couldn\u2019\
  t believe my eyes; an Asian elephant was coming through the bushes almost as if\
  \ to see who disrupted her surroundings. As she walked towards us, her large ears\
  \ flapped in the heat, and her strong trunk swayed from left to right. I could hear\
  \ how powerful her body was as she broke through the tree branches as she stepped\
  \ through her natural habitat.\n\nI have seen elephants in a zoo, but nothing compared\
  \ to this. Out there, there was no barrier between us, yet we kept our distance\
  \ not to disturb her. There was no one riding her, no basket fastened tightly to\
  \ her, no one trying to pose with her, or bathe her. She was free. Free as she should\
  \ be in her own home where this sanctuary was ensuring it was possible. \n\nWhile\
  \ we admired her from a respectful distance, the programme coordinator informed\
  \ us of her life story. Her name was Sambo, and she was 55 years old. I was amazed\
  \ to hear her story, and learning that all animals have a story and a purpose in\
  \ the world just like all of us. It was moving to hear she was a survivor. A survivor\
  \ of something we as humans have caused, an industry that benefited so few, yet\
  \ had disastrous consequences for so many. I marvelled at the existence of this\
  \ beautiful creature and the way she navigated her way through the protected jungle.\
  \ At that very moment, that is where something changed in me; this trip meant more\
  \ than I had anticipated. \n\nNow, as I look back out my window, the storm is beginning\
  \ to pass, but what it has awakened inside of me is something that will forever\
  \ remain. I too have a purpose in this world that is my jungle. Now is the time\
  \ to show the world that elephants should be respected and admired for the magnificent\
  \ animals they are. It is time to spread the word of the importance of animal conservation\
  \ and awareness."
