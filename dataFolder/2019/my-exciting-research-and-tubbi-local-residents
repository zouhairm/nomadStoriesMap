Text: "For me, it is my passion and my need to travel around the world, i've been\
  \ to too many beautifull places in Indonesia like Mount Bromo , Borobudur temple,\
  \ Lombok, and Makassar also, and i also been to abroad wice, i got a lot of experience\
  \ that i didn't expect to find that makes my mind open wider, but the most attractive\
  \ travel story is not in the place that i write above, it is the story that i make\
  \ about 1 month ago in my own regency that is a leap to unknown, i went to Tubbi\
  \ Taramanu district is not because i want to go there to travel. It is only 3 hours\
  \ away from my house, and also the field was so challenging and i hope no purpose\
  \ to go there expext to fill my research data, i never been there since i was born\
  \ because what i heard about that place is a bit strange and many information said\
  \ that the local resident often to got the black magic. But my father said it's\
  \ okay, he has been there so many times, i went there by motorcycle and that is\
  \ right, the field was twice challenging that i was thinking of. \n\nIwent there\
  \ with my cousins and always keep on our mind that we will not eat anyfood on there\
  \ even the local residents serve us because many people say that it's danger to\
  \ eat the food by them, i met a lot of local residents there which is so generous\
  \ and they look at us like we are so new to them eventough we are just 3 hours away\
  \ from them, they are so polite an finally they serve us durian, a kind of king\
  \ of fruit in Southeast Asia, and even though they are good but I still hesitate\
  \ and remember the messages of people, don't eat food from them! I thought the rope\
  \ was just fruit and it was not polite to refuse so i ate it anyway carefully, then\
  \ I ate the fruit and was thankful nothing happened, they also served me yellow\
  \ rice and I ate it because I was very hungry and nothing happened until now.\n\n\
  I concluded that it was not good to judge people very easy before you get to know\
  \ them and it depends on your prejudice, you still have to be carefull to the rumour\
  \ and you may receive food from anyone but don't forget to remember God then nothing\
  \ will happen, my father's message that I applied in my life. Tubbi was only 3 hours\
  \ from my place but instead I was never interested there, it turned out the scenery\
  \ was very beautiful and the local residents was very good, so my message is try\
  \ to know your area deeply before you try to know other peoples area then you can\
  \ know your self better and again. Tubbi teach me a lot of things that many places\
  \ i didn't expected before it."
