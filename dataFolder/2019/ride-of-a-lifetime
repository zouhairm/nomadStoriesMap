Text: "Around 1 pm, a Scotsman, Brit, and American rented bikes to go explore the\
  \ bike trails in the Redwood forest of New Zealand.  It was a 30 min ride just to\
  \ get to the Forrest and when we got there, the amount of trails were endless! \
  \ So many to choose from and easy to get lost.  So after a few minutes of looking\
  \ over at the map, we planned out a rout that would allow us to go on a few and\
  \ make it back into town before 5.  The bikes were due at 5 but we also had to catch\
  \ a bus to the next town at five.  \nThe trails were amazing and to be honest, I\
  \ had never gone mountain biking.  At first it was frightening to go down steep\
  \ inclines that were also narrow.  Not to mention that it had been years since I\
  \ had been on a peddle bike.  Well, after a little courage and a few bumps and scratches\
  \ I got the hang of it.  Clock hit 4 o\u2019clock when we were deep in the forest\
  \ and still had one more trail to make it back to the main road and head back to\
  \ town, deliver the bikes, walk to the hostel, grab our stuff and walk to the bus\
  \ stop.  By this time, I was so tired.  There were already many times I just had\
  \ to get off the bike and recover my energy.  My quads were burning, running low\
  \ on water and on time, literally, there was no room for error.  The Dragon\u2019\
  s Tail was the last bike trail, and we are off!  Right away I slam into a tree stump\
  \ and when I brush it off and try to keep going, I realize the chain came off! So\
  \ I quickly fix it and keep going.  Throbbing pain, out of breath and sweating buckets,\
  \ and I still manage to keep going.  I had never pushed myself this much.   We make\
  \ it to the main road but we are still not out of the woods.  In every sense of\
  \ the phrase.  It\u2019s 4:15, we still have to ride into town, which is 30 minuets\
  \ and do all that other stuff.  At this point, I can\u2019t peddle much longer,\
  \ but we came to a point where it\u2019s a wide open dirt road and it\u2019s all\
  \ down hill!  For like a full mile it was all downhill easily going around 20 miles\
  \ and hour.   It felt like I was flying! We make it down hill and we are finally\
  \ out of the woods.  Time is 4:20 and still the 30 min ride.  I check the map and\
  \ see that we can save time if we cut through a lumber yard but it was gated.  To\
  \ our fortune, we see the gate opens, we start peddling, almost closing on me. \
  \ Now we are stuck inside with no way out but see a car right at that moment, leaving\
  \ and we take the opportunity.  We Exit and not we are find ourselves on the outskirts\
  \ of town.  I am relived because now it\u2019s like a 10 min ride and it\u2019s\
  \ 4:25.  We peddle and peddle! We head down a bridge but as we ride up, my legs\
  \ cramp up.  There was no hope left.  I couldn\u2019t move.  I told them to keep\
  \ going, I\u2019ll catch up.  As I recovered I saw maps again and decided to take\
  \ the street with cars to make up time.  I start peddling after some rest and maintain\
  \ a slow but steady pace.  To my surprise I make it back in town at 4:35, and managed\
  \ to catch up to my buddies.  I couldn\u2019t stop smiling and my heart was still\
  \ racing. We arrived to return the bikes which were from a local ice cream shop.\
  \  We made it in time for the bus and got FREE ice cream!  Best ice cream I have\
  \ ever had."
