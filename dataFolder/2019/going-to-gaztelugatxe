Text: "I'm the only one on the bus. I arrive to Bakio, a small, sleepy beach town\
  \ on the Iberian Peninsula's Basque country. It's greener and colder than I expected.\
  \ Quieter too. But it's October, and the beach-going crowds are long gone. \nAs\
  \ I step off the bus, I ask the driver how can I get to San Juan de Gaztelugatxe.\
  \ He understands where I'm going, though I can hardly pronounce the name. He's probably\
  \ answered my question hundreds of times. He says I can either wait for an even\
  \ smaller bus, which could arrive on an hour or so because of the off-season, or\
  \ I could take a hilly path along the coast, which could take me an hour or so to\
  \ get to my destination. It's 4:50p.m., and autumn light is going out fast. I thank\
  \ him and start walking.\nAfter a few blocks of sterile white apartment buildings\
  \ with metal window curtains, the street turns into a bushy, quaint trail. Far away\
  \ on my right, the purple mountains of northern Euskadi country, home to peaceful\
  \ Bilbao. On my left, the rocky shores of the Bay of Biscay. \nEvery hundred meters\
  \ or so, a short picket fence or a lone mailbox remind me that although not on sight,\
  \ houses are nearby amongst these rolling hills crowned by rosy trees. Had New Zealand\
  \ not been the right spot, this could pretty much had stand for The Shire.\nI keep\
  \ on walking. A hundred meters below, the pebbled beaches turn into rocky inlets,\
  \ water splashing against stony walls.\nI've been traveling for almost 30 days.\
  \ It's not the first time I'm trying to beat the sunset. But this time it feels\
  \ like a make or break scenario. \nI'm sweating already. I surely look like a mess.\
  \ The path suddenly turns into a dense forest of white woods and muddy tracks. It\
  \ reminds me of the undulating trails at Chipinque Park, back at home. \nBut I'm\
  \ in a hurry.\nI walk for five minutes and then promisingly and naively run for\
  \ almost 40 seconds straight. \nPanting, and the back of my light jacket drenched\
  \ in sweat, I stop to breath in the cold, jagged air. I cough. A lot.\nI keep on\
  \ going and repeat the operation two, three more times. Uphill, downhill. Swerving\
  \ left and right. I hear a car somewhere. Then nothing. Boy, this could have been\
  \ a beautiful walk if I had planned it better. The beautiful spectacle of autumn\
  \ reds against the dark blue horizon be damned.\nThen the woods open. \nAnd I see\
  \ it.\nGaztelugatxe Doniene, the tiny San Juan de Gaztelugatxe Chappel, sitting\
  \ atop a rocky island, rising a few hundred meters above the rolling sea.\nI'm high\
  \ up enough on a cliff that I can see down on to it.\nAnd then it dawns on me.\n\
  If I'm to reach the bridge that lets me onto the island, I have to make it down\
  \ a winding path that'll set me back at least 15 minutes. And the milky, yellowy\
  \ sunset is telling me I won't make it. \nSo there go I. Walking, jogging, and inevitably\
  \ running downhill, surprising myself at my own velocity, hoofing dangerously, trying\
  \ to beat the dusk.\nAnd here I am.\nThe curvy path turns into an improvised parking\
  \ lot for three vehicles. A yellow, metal gate welcomes me. I cross the bridge.\
  \ I look up. I marvel at it. Tranquil waves lap at the base of the island. The place\
  \ is empty. It figures.\nI go up step by step by step of the long, gray stairway.\n\
  It's narrow. How could a crew of 50 people work its way around here?\nThe steps\
  \ turn and bend as they lazily steep themselves, going higher until they reach the\
  \ Chappel. \nBut I'm not here for the Chappel. I'm here for the steps themselves.\
  \ Call this what you will: a whim, a caprice. But coming here, looking out into\
  \ the sea, unto the cliff I just climbed up and down, far away to the town I left\
  \ behind, unto the twilight of one of the most beautiful sunsets I've ever seen,\
  \ I'm happy to be here, at Dragonstone."
