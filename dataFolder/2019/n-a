Text: "Abel, a seeker of wisdom receives the messages from his heart to make a pilgrimage\
  \ to Portugal. As he landed from the plane, it\u2019s January first and into the\
  \ new year, he steps into a new land, although familiar, he has never been, the\
  \ ancient city of Lisbon. \n\nWith a new chapter in his life, Abel is on a journey.\
  \ Not to find himself or the meaning of life, but to explore what it means to be\
  \ more connected by looking forwards and backwards in time. \n\nIt was his first\
  \ night and already he was attacked in his sleep. Not by physical means but a spirit\
  \ with whom recognized his presence. His light. As Abel fights for his life this\
  \ spirit was relentless as it attempted to take his breath away. Abel continues\
  \ to gasp for air. An initiation to push the boundaries of his strength. \n\nTraveling\
  \ across Portugal, Abel is reminded of his many lives in this enchanted land. His\
  \ many lives on a mission to uplift the spirits of the lost and needy. Clarity enter\
  \ his mind when he meditates. \n\nBy remembering each of his past life. They offer\
  \ him a chance to become more of himself. An alignment towards greater joy. When\
  \ his mind is still and his spirit is open Abel asks for the clues given in each\
  \ lesson. They are awakened in him when he enters a new and familier place. \n\n\
  As Abel was gasping for air, on that first night in Lisbon, he was reminded of being\
  \ tortured by a priest. A corrupt priest nonetheless in the dark ages. Little did\
  \ Abel know as his dwellings happened to reside nearby the church in which he was\
  \ a monk. The place of his death ordered by this very priest. \n\nAs a monk he believed\
  \ in compassion whereas the corrupt priest believed in power. Greed! This energy\
  \ recognizes him right away and it was a test to give Abel the strength for his\
  \ new journey. \n\nMany stories like these, Abel encounters as his adventure across\
  \ this ancient land blossoms into a love story. Not of another but of himself. \n\
  \nThrough the eyes of this wisdom seeker we get to learn how to see the world a\
  \ rich history and something more profound we are a part of. Glimpses of our own\
  \ love story too. \n\nHis synchronicities and discoveries and with no plan other\
  \ than to witness. He learns to receive. The simple pleasures of gratitude. \n\n\
  A journey to remember and the strength to step into a new way of being. Being connected\
  \ to a world moving forwards and backwards in time."
