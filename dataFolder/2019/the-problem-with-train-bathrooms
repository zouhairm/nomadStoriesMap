Text: "Train bathrooms are many things: cramped, a tad over-used, and home to a mystifying\
  \ array of bacteria. But rarely are they snapshots of sentiments undercutting society.\
  \ Such was the case while I was aboard a Swiss train, heading back to my homestay\
  \ in Soleuvre, Luxembourg. My head was swimming with vignettes of the Alps and vast,\
  \ beautiful fields, and practicality was as far from my mind as I was from home.\
  \ However, reality has a flare for the dramatic, and I was smacked back into it\
  \ when I opened the bathroom door to a sight I won\u2019t soon forget: a mosaic\
  \ of blood-red sharpie swastikas, of all manner of sizes, covering the walls. Encircling\
  \ each were messages of hate toward migrants and refugees, riddled with racial slurs.\
  \ This was the spring of 2016, and foreshadowed a number of events in the ensuing\
  \ years that I never thought possible in the late 2010\u2019s. Deeply shaken, I\
  \ returned to my seat, and stared silently out the dark window until the train arrived\
  \ in Luxembourg City. \n\nMonday evenings in Luxembourg found me heading to the\
  \ local refugee center I volunteered at after class, about a fifteen minute walk\
  \ away depending on how much caffeine was running through my system. The school\
  \ across the street let out around the same time and children and their parents\
  \ filled the sidewalks, bubbling with stories of the school day in Luxembourgish,\
  \ German, and French, as they walked hand in hand. I would catch a word or two and\
  \ pat myself on the back, ignoring the fact that most of these kids could speak\
  \ four languages. Next came the pub patio where a group of elderly men would gather.\
  \ While I never knew what they were discussing, almost every comment was followed\
  \ by an outrageous burst of laughter. I passed parks full of vibrant tulips and\
  \ pastel-painted houses. Then came the climb to the top of the hill on which the\
  \ church that housed the center sat. At the foot of the stairs waited a striped\
  \ cat who would sometimes let you pet him and other times scurry up the stairs and\
  \ into the surrounding fields, which were home to four delightfully random and rambunctious\
  \ goats. The higher I climbed, and more out of breath I became, the more of the\
  \ town and surrounding fields I could see, until I reached the church and had a\
  \ picturesque view of life below. The church itself was a sight, as a brick building\
  \ somewhat octagonal in shape outlined in a thick strip of safety-vest orange. \n\
  \nInside awaited a dedicated team of volunteers who relied on very creative hand\
  \ gestures and plenty of warm smiles to communicate. The majority of my time volunteering\
  \ was consumed by sorting through piles and piles of donations from local residents,\
  \ from children\u2019s clothes to cooking utensils. However, I was extremely lucky\
  \ to assist a mother of a one-year-old epileptic son who came to the center rattled\
  \ and visibly anxious, with a long list of much-needed supplies. After about an\
  \ hour of talking, listening, and shuffling through donations, she left not only\
  \ with bags full of clothes and supplies, but some semblance of peace of mind.\n\
  \nAfter my shift ended that day and as I was walking back down the hill, I found\
  \ myself thinking of the red-sharpie swastikas I had seen in the train bathroom.\
  \ The messages of hate they contained could not be reflected less by the center,\
  \ its volunteers, or those it sought to help. As I continued to reflect on my time\
  \ in Europe, I realized that the only time I had ever caught a glimpse of such hate\
  \ was in that train bathroom. Instead, I had seen tolerance, altruism, and unbridled\
  \ kindness. That\u2019s the problem with train bathrooms, or at least the narrow\
  \ mindsets they came to represent for me; had I focused on those red-sharpie swastikas\
  \ and not become involved in the community around me, I would have returned home\
  \ with a much different view of European society. The sun had almost completely\
  \ set, but a faint glow remained over the town below, and I too left the center\
  \ with much more peace of mind."
