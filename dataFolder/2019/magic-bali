Text: "Thanks a lot for my parents who gave me such a big opportunity to travel in\
  \ my childhood. I was dreaming about living abroad for a very long time. My dreams\
  \ as usual comes true. At the age of 17 I left home and start traveling around the\
  \ world. I spend two and a half year leaving abroad and it was the great experience\
  \ in my life. But I want to tell you about one country where I used to live for\
  \ a six months. It was Indonesia, for sure Bali. It was a time go a great begging\
  \ and changes. I think that every person should come here and spent some time and\
  \ for sure you will it, if not.. are you from the our planet?\n\nOne day when you\
  \ will come to Bali and you will understand why it is magic. It wasn't my first\
  \ time there, but for sure after a few days I understand that I don't know anything,\
  \ like I've never been here.\nIncredible places, positive energy from the local\
  \ people and tourist who are always easy to connect, tasty food, sound of the ocean,\
  \ driving motorbike, watching the beautiful sunsets and sunrises, surfing and the\
  \ sea of love. Does it sounds incredible? For sure it does. And the real picture\
  \ is the same.\nWhen you came to Bali you shouldn't stay at one place, you better\
  \ make a short trips around the whole island. Take a small backpack, be like a teenager,\
  \ without luggage and without prejudice. Feel free like you are at home. if you\
  \ will open you heart, the whole world will do the same. Where you will have opportunity\
  \ to do this if not on Bali? \nAfter you travel to Bali you life will change in\
  \ perfect way, you will even don't know how, but it will work on you. The feeling\
  \ of yourself will become so strong, and you thought will be like a small pieces\
  \ in the huge universe. Mine is changing me on 360-degree. I spend 6 months where\
  \ and I can easily told that this is my second home town. I don't want to tell you\
  \ about living there, don't want to pick an opportunity from you. Better to feel\
  \ you own experience that to read it in the book. \n\nIf you just have been on Bali,\
  \ you couldn't said that you've seen it. Its only one way to know Bali-feel.\nBecause\
  \ it is much more interesting to watch the football game when you don't know the\
  \ score"
