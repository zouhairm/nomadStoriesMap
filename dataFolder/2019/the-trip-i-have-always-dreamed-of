Text: "This past summer my dad and I traveled to our home country, Portugal. It has\
  \ been something we have wanted to do for years and we were finally about to do\
  \ it. Sitting on the plane looking out the window as we were taking off from Boston,\
  \ to me it just felt like we were on a plane heading anywhere but Portugal and it\
  \ wasn\u2019t until five hours later when we the pilot announced that we were about\
  \ to land on a little island named Ponta Delgada to get onto our second plane when\
  \ it finally hit me that my dream of seeing my family again has finally come true.\
  \ Eventually, we landed in Ponta Delgada and I couldn\u2019t tell who was more excited,\
  \ me or my dad. When we got off the plane it was not like any other time I\u2019\
  ve gotten off a plane, this time they had stairs set up and we just walked right\
  \ off the plane on to the pavement. Once we started walking away my dad said to\
  \ me \u201CVanessa turn around really quick\u201D and once I turned around I never\
  \ really realized how big an airplane actually was until then. Being on the pavement\
  \ twenty feet away from an airplane that carries a quarter of the town I live in\
  \ was astonishing.\nEventually, after another three or four hours we landed in capital\
  \ of the most beautiful country in the world, Lisbon. From there a friend of ours\
  \ who my dad grew up with Mario, who lives closer to the airport than our family\
  \ picked us up and the smile on my dad\u2019s face when he saw his friend Mario\
  \ is probably a smile I can never forget because it was so genuine and a smile I\
  \ hadn\u2019t seen on his face for a long time. After spending two days in Lisbon\
  \ we finally packed up the car and set out for a two-hour drive to Olh\xE3o to finally\
  \ see all of our family! It had been able twelve years since I have seen them all\
  \ so I was really excited to see them all again and this time remember them.\nAs\
  \ we were in Olha\xF5 before heading to the house we have there, my dad pulled down\
  \ a tight narrow street and he pulled over in front of a set of big, bright green\
  \ doors and my dad told me that was where he was born and grew up. I thought it\
  \ was pretty cool to see the house my dad grew up in because it looked absolutely\
  \ nothing like the houses we see here. A few minutes later and the time had finally\
  \ come where for the first time in twelve years I was going to see my family. Instead\
  \ of going to our house my dad surprised me by bringing me to my uncles home first\
  \ and there was everyone! There was my aunt, uncle, grandfather, and all of my cousins.\
  \ After walking into the door, I felt the smile on my face grow from ear to ear,\
  \ this was one of the happiest days of my life and one I don\u2019t think I can\
  \ ever forget. I also got to meet for the first time my younger cousins Alexander\
  \ and Leonor (which is Eleanor in Portuguese) who ran up to me when I got there.\
  \ We went to Sagres, Lagos, Algarve, Faro, Sintra where we saw the Palace of Pena,\
  \ we saw so many beautiful castles, and we also saw the Belem Tower where I saw\
  \ a cop car which also happened to be one of my favorite BMW models. One day we\
  \ even spent the day in Spain, we got onto the and we just went over and spent the\
  \ day walking around and enjoying the beautiful 100-degree sun. Towards the end\
  \ of the two weeks and a half weeks we spent in Portugal my dad and I spent two\
  \ nights on an island off the coast of Ohla\xF5 called Farol, and there we have\
  \ a beautiful island house right on the beach which is where we stayed."
