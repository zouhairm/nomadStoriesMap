Text: "A small story of heartbreak, adventure and decision making aboard a houseboat\
  \ in Thailand\u2019s West.\n\n\nWhen the opportunity came up in our Skype editorial\
  \ chat, I didn\u2019t expect I\u2019d be the only one to reply. I also didn\u2019\
  t expect to find myself making a decision which would dictate the next six months\
  \ of life aboard a houseboat by the Myanmar border, but I guess that\u2019s how\
  \ it happens.\n\n\u201CAnyone interested in going on a media tour in Songkhalburi?\u201D\
  \ With no real idea of where it was or how I\u2019d get there, I volunteered. I\
  \ asked my colleagues sitting nearby if they wanted to go--it was my first internship\
  \ and I didn\u2019t know my place.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t a luxurious hotel-like tour,\
  \ the kind high-end media usually go on. Instead it began in a van, took transit\
  \ at Riverkwai Bridge and found its final refuge on an old and cracked wooden pier.\n\
  \nNo internet or mobile phone reception, scarce power points and barely enough power\
  \ to charge an iPhone. The accommodation? A boiling hot room aboard a wooden houseboat\
  \ with a small bar, a few beach chairs and canoes. On second thought, I\u2019m not\
  \ entirely sure it could even be called a houseboat since the entire thing was dragged\
  \ around by a smaller, noisy vessel.\n\nHouse float aside, the main story begins\
  \ 12 months earlier when a 21-year-old boy fell in love for the first time. In his\
  \ first year of university he met an exchange student who would play the most significant\
  \ role to date in his small and somewhat sad relationship history.\n\nAs the tour\
  \ began, I was hit with a sense of recollection. It was the first time I\u2019d\
  \ been out of the city in fourth months, and while the air was hot and humid, it\
  \ was refreshing. Even at the peak of summer, there was something so different about\
  \ it.\n\nTwo days before the tour would begin, an email came through from my exchange\
  \ coordinator asking if I\u2019d like to proceed with my application to study in\
  \ Hong Kong or remain in Bangkok for the following semester. She knew my original\
  \ plan, and how I\u2019d made the back-up after changing my first preference.\n\n\
  As I opened the door to my room, I was greeted by a double bed with two towel swans\
  \ enclosed by what we\u2019ll call the Thai equivalent to a princesses bed curtains--a\
  \ mosquito net, which carefully yet stylishly enclosed the bed. There was a window\
  \ and a small balcony from which you could see fishermen pass by on wooden longtail\
  \ boats. Occasionally they\u2019d even wave back while zipping past. It was all\
  \ a little romantic--and a reminder of the person I\u2019d invited but didn\u2019\
  t join.\n\nI had to give my decision to the coordinator by the end of the week and\
  \ as the tour was due back Friday, I\u2019d allowed myself the trip to make up my\
  \ mind. With no internet or reception, all I had was time to think. \n\nAs the house\
  \ float would use a small anchor to park up overnight, I came to realise my own\
  \ anchor, the one which was subconsciously persuading me to stay in Bangkok. My\
  \ anchor hadn\u2019t quite done what I\u2019d hoped--you see the very reason I came\
  \ to this city had floated away from me a month before I set foot on this trip.\
  \ For some reason, deep down I was still waiting for the tide to bring her back.\n\
  \nOver the next few days as I jumped off submerged trees, canoed past sunken temples,\
  \ watched the sun set over Khao Laem Lake and simply floated around in a makeshift\
  \ truck tube with a beer in hand, I began to realise how naive I\u2019d been. With\
  \ the help of the tour guide, I reluctantly made up my mind: I wouldn\u2019t be\
  \ able to forgive myself if I stayed for a relationship that was far from at bay.\n\
  \nWhile I wouldn\u2019t recommend travel as a means of getting over someone, because\
  \ that wasn\u2019t the case for me, I would recommend a change of scenery to refresh\
  \ your perspective. If I hadn\u2019t done so, I wouldn\u2019t have the friends or\
  \ connections that I do today in Hong Kong."
