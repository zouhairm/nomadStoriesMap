Text: "It is 7 am and I am opening my eyes, feeling confused, trying to get an understanding\
  \ where I am. You know those couple second when you wake up at a new place and attempt\
  \ to assess how did you get here \u2013 the best feeling ever, isn\u2019t it? Humid\
  \ air and ocean sounds, white noise of the fan on the background. \u201COh yeah,\
  \ I am in Hawai\u2019i\u201D I say to myself. I am here for a 3 day layover I have\
  \ on my way to Japan.\n\nI enter a bathroom, quick splash of a cold water on my\
  \ face to wake me up. I head to a kitchen to grab couple water bottles, some snacks\
  \ and as I head out, I stop for a second to realize that I might possibly not return\
  \ here tonight. No, I am not leaving to airport. I am going to climb Haiku Stairs\
  \ today, also called Stairway to Heaven, which is exactly 3922 ILLEGAL steps up\
  \ the Koolau mountain range. And yeah, they are illegal to climb. Mainly due to\
  \ the amount of people who got injured or died trying to find that Heaven on earth.\n\
  \nTo be honest, I don\u2019t know where I lost my sense of fear going to climb this\
  \ alone, with no gear or map. I quit my job, booked a 4-week trip across Southeast\
  \ Asia, but \u201CWhy\u201D you would ask. I don\u2019t know, I am so lost in this\
  \ life that I came to face her Majesty Death, seeking answers, as to who am I meant\
  \ to be.\n\nAs I am driving towards the nearest entry point, I start noticing cops\
  \ more often. And as I drive all the way uphill, I see hatred in the neighborhood\
  \ as they recognize me as a foreigner. \u201CAnother one\u201D they yell \u2013\
  \ \u201CWhat are you trying to die today? Go home or I will call the cops\u201D\
  . I stopped my car and let him approach me trying to hold my ground. \n-\u201CI\
  \ want to go up there\u201D-I said. \n-\u201CWhy? Why all of you people think this\
  \ is safe to do. See the fence, it is here for a reason\u201D \u2013 he said angrily,\
  \ but stopping as he saw that I am not going to leave \u2013 \u201CPeople have died\
  \ there before. Plus you are bothering us, locals. This is not a touristic place.\
  \ We live here\u201D\n-\u201CPlease\u201D \u2013 I said, looking at the fence \n\
  -\u201CNo, go somewhere else\u201D \u2013 was his response I realized that he is\
  \ directing me to other 2 entrance points.\n\nSo I drove down to a second entry\
  \ point and walked up the hill this time, instead of driving all the way up. Dogs\
  \ are barking at me, walking up the whole village. I took my shoes off and was trying\
  \ to go quietly unnoticed, but all useless, so I ran barefoot up the hill until\
  \ I slipped into the entry point, wearing my military jacket and right into the\
  \ bushes I vanished. Little did I know that, one has to go through hell first when\
  \ trying to go to heaven. \n\nAs I am climbing, the mountain is getting steeper\
  \ and steeper. It just rained this morning here, I realized, because mud is preventing\
  \ me from climbing. I can feel a sense of helplessness and anger boiling up inside\
  \ of me. It felt like I am fighting for my life against the nature. My whole body\
  \ covered in mud and mosquito bites. I lost my backpack, because after another fall,\
  \ I crushed all my food and water. Nevertheless, with tears in my eyes, I climbed\
  \ until I got stuck. The hill was almost vertical and a thin tree trunk caught me,\
  \ sticking out like the hook for shower towels. I was caught with my legs right\
  \ in between the tree trunk, hitting my butt bone. Because the slope was so steep,\
  \ the tree almost hugged me, forcefully holding me against the ground. I remember\
  \ sitting on that tree trunk, looking down at the freeway beneath, breathing heavily,\
  \ crying from inability to move any muscle, saying to myself: How far are you willing\
  \ to go looking for your identity? I could feel Her Majesty breathing down my neck."
