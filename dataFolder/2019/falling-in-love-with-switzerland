Text: "Falling in Love with Switzerland\n\n\"I'm all out of guts,\" I announced.\n\
  \u201CWhat\u201D? Responded my confused husband.\n\u201CI don\u2019t have any more\
  \ guts, I have used them all up. I\u2019m ready for the relaxing part of this Swiss\
  \ vacation.\u201D\n\nThat was a snippet of a conversation that I had with my husband\
  \ at our rented chalet in the car-free Swiss village of Murren. We had just finished\
  \ a trifecta of adventurous activities. Though I had delighted in the fact that\
  \ I had actually attempted and successfully completed the heart-pounding adventures\
  \ of canyoning, skydiving, and navigating a via ferrata, I was ready to experience\
  \ the fairytale landscape in a more relaxing manner.\nWe had brought our boys to\
  \ see and explore Switzerland, the land of chocolate, watches, banking, and scenery\
  \ beyond compare. Our home for the week overlooked the magnificent Lauterbrunnen\
  \ valley with front row seats to the majestic Eiger, Monch, and Jungfrau peaks.\
  \ The spectacular valley with numerous towering waterfalls and lush green meadows\
  \ was absolutely pristine. \n\nThe Jungfrau region of Switzerland is known as the\
  \ adventure capital of the world with an overabundance of choices for adventure\
  \ seekers. Our first adventure was canyoning.  I can best describe canyoning as\
  \ rock waterslides carved by nature with added cliff jumping and rappelling. This\
  \ can be a challenge as one must convince themselves several times within a span\
  \ of a few hours to continuously jump, slide, and swim without hesitation as hesitation\
  \ can lead to injury. Overall, I escaped the exhilarating and beautiful experience\
  \ with minor bumps and bruises unconvinced whether or not I would go again.\n\n\
  A harrowing experience followed on the via ferrata from Murren to Gimmelwald. A\
  \ via ferrata or way of iron is a series of iron rungs drilled into the mountain\
  \ to aid in negotiating the mountainous terrain.  It started as a slightly vigorous\
  \ hike with various ladders and rungs directing us up, down, and around the mountainside.\
  \ Then, we came upon what my husband and I termed the \u201Cwall of death\u201D\
  \ on the sheer face of the mountain complete with a 1400-meter drop. Yes, we had\
  \ carabiners to hook into the rungs, but I am not a climber, and I was sick with\
  \ the knowledge that I was in charge of making sure that I was connected at all\
  \ times. At that point of the adventure, I was too busy concentrating on each movement\
  \ to care about the lush green carpeted valley below me or the paragliders in the\
  \ distance. My hands and arms ached from the death grip that I was applying to the\
  \ rungs.   Obviously, I lived to tell the story and cross over footbridge obstacles\
  \ strung high in the air that finally allowed me to relish in my surroundings. Still,\
  \ I was unconvinced that I would repeat this activity anytime soon either.\n\nMy\
  \ favorite adventure of the trip that I would do again in a heartbeat turned out\
  \ to be skydiving. I told myself that if I was going to try skydiving, it might\
  \ as well be in one of the most beautiful places that I had ever seen. I was able\
  \ to take my maiden voyage in a helicopter to get up close and personal with glaciers,\
  \ waterfalls, and the trio of mountain peaks. It seemed like a fantastic idea to\
  \ share this experience with my son until I saw him dropping out of the helicopter\
  \ at a ridiculously alarming rate. Up until that point, I had only been somewhat\
  \ nervous, not scared.  I pushed back any terrifying thoughts for my son as Frank,\
  \ the man that I was literally attached to for my jump, was now nudging me forward\
  \ to the open door. Suddenly, I was out of the helicopter, and my stomach was immediately\
  \ in my throat. At first, I was very mechanical trying to remember all previous\
  \ instructions; arms out, head up, back arched. Then, something unusual happened,\
  \ the parachute opened, and I experienced the most soothing silence that I have\
  \ ever heard. For the next several moments, I was able to drink in the stunning\
  \ landscape, it was absolutely breathtaking. The colors were almost too perfect\
  \ like a fake Hollywood backdrop but it was real, it was Switzerland."
