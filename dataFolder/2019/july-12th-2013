Text: "It is July 12th, 2013, our three year wedding anniversary. I am in line at\
  \ a Wal-Mart in Knoxville; (open 24 hours, open on Christmas).\n \nAnd in my basket,\
  \ I have toothpaste without fluoride (because I listen when you say, \u201CFluoride\
  \ is the devil, it\u2019s so bad for you\u201D), two electric toothbrushes, and\
  \ one orange whistling tea kettle. Because our kettle at home does not whistle anymore.\
  \ \n \n-\n \nI\u2019m thinking of your chipped front tooth and how the orange Mexican\
  \ sunflowers in our front yard are taller than the both of us.\n \n-\n \nAnd I notice\
  \ something crusty on my left cheek I didn\u2019t expect to find. I scratch it,\
  \ my fingernail fills with bright yellow gunk. The egg yolk from breakfast. This\
  \ morning there was three eggs, runny yolks, marble rye, butter, arugula, coffee.\n\
  -\n\n\nBut now it\u2019s 7:00 pm.\n \nAnd when I get home it\u2019s 8:00. \n \n\
  And we celebrate our anniversary with onion and potato paranthas we learned how\
  \ to make in Chandigarh.\n \n-\n \nWhen we met you said, \u201CMy teeth are so bad!\
  \ I can\u2019t afford to go to the dentist.\u201D\n \nAnd now we slide our tongues\
  \ around our slippery teeth. You say, \"My mouth feels Actually Clean.\"\n-\n \n\
  When we get in bed I lay awake thinking of all the slippery places we\u2019ve been:\
  \ the red clay clouded Tuscarawas River outside Newcomerstown, softly lolling with\
  \ fish bloated with mercury. The raw sewage we stepped over to get into our hostel\
  \ in Kanyakumari. \nI remember the little girl bending down to the murk. I see her\u2014\
  \ she tips her cup and snatches a bluegill.\n-\n\nAnd then when I dream, I dream\
  \ of cutting down the Mexican sunflowers in our front yard while you trim your beard\
  \ in the sink. \n \n-\nAnd in the end we do not stay together, we move worlds apart\
  \ and I cry. \n\n \nBut over the continents I see us looking in mirrors, brushing\
  \ our smiles at the same time."
