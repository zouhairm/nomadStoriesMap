Text: "I had 5 euros in my pocket and was unable to get money back for my euro ticket\
  \ to Paris for Bastille day. I spent the day in the Lourve and thought that night\
  \ I could do \"Midnight in Paris\" where I walk around the city all night. I was\
  \ sorely mistaken. People were drunk and laughing at me for not knowing French.\
  \ I walked all the streets trying to sleep on benches or behind hidden bushes and\
  \ nothing really worked. I was cold and very hungry. Around six in the morning I\
  \ end up outside the Arc De Triumph. I'm reading a book when a stranger comes and\
  \ sits down next to me. He notices the book is in English and speaks to me. I laugh\
  \ because I tell him that I didn't realize the level of smoking in Paris till this\
  \ little trip. He sheepishly replies it brought him love and now he finds it hard\
  \ to quit. He then invites me to lunch and I admit I have no money to pay and he\
  \ says it's okay because no one should come to Paris without trying coffee at least\
  \ once. This charming person who shows me kindness is named Pascal. \n\nWe end up\
  \ at a cafe and begin to eat breakfast. Our conversations are about our lives. He\
  \ tells me about his deployment in Afghanistan and I tell him about how I'm a student\
  \ in America. I grow more comfortable as the talk goes on and tell him more about\
  \ my life. I talk about how my father died 2 years before and how my heart was broken.\
  \ He talks about his travels leading him to live in Ireland a bit, hence his strong\
  \ English skills. Breakfast then leads into lunch which leads into beers. I don't\
  \ know what's happening but we just have the best conversations all day. Anything\
  \ I felt worried or ashamed or scared about, I suddenly felt okay to share with\
  \ this stranger. The beer and laughter and observations about our different cultures\
  \ were so wonderful. I changed his opinion about Americans being ignorant to other\
  \ cultures. There was a magic to this experience I wasn't expecting. After several\
  \ hours of beers and food Pascal then offers to walk me back to my home. I then\
  \ have a choice to lie or be honest. I told him the bench he found me at this morning\
  \ was where I was staying. He then invites me home and says his roommates will be\
  \ surprised by this but it'll be ok. I tell myself if I feel at all uncomfortable\
  \ i will bail. This is the American paranoia in me.\n\nLuckily- everything that\
  \ happens then on is fun. I walk with him to the train and we watch street performers.\
  \ He lifts me over through the ticket booth to the train because i have no money.\
  \ We end up singing on the train all the way back to his house. Inside he lets me\
  \ sleep on the couch and it is the first night of sleep I've had in a day. I awake\
  \ hours later to see his roommate and as an American I open my mouth and English\
  \ comes out throwing this poor roommate for a loop. His name is Alex and he feeds\
  \ me macarroons. I fall back alsleep until Pascal wakes me up and tells me he was\
  \ to go to another town but that I am welcome to stay in his home until I have to\
  \ go back to England. I'm overwhelmed by this kindness and I laugh anymore when\
  \ he leaves me his house keys telling him in America this would never happen. He\
  \ leaves me and reminds me I'm a beautiful person that will be okay. He wants nothing\
  \ from me. I'm left in the care of his roommate till I leave the next day.\n\nWhen\
  \ I return to England before coming home to America I'm forever changed. I will\
  \ always remember the kindness a complete stranger gave to me and I remember to\
  \ pay that forward to others. That experience encourages me to travel to this day\
  \ and it's something that I'll always know as a lucky adventure."
