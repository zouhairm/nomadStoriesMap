Text: "Every morning getting ready for work in the winter of 1967 I would hear a radio\
  \ commercial for Pan Am Flight One \"Flight One is leaving to go Around The World\
  \ today; What are you doing\".  I would day dream about that flight all the way\
  \ to work.  Someday maybe I would take that flight.... \n\nMy first adult trip was\
  \ in 1968 to London and Rome; I loved it.  I loved being on the plane, the arrival,\
  \ finding my hotel, meeting new people, figuring out pounds, shillings and pence\
  \ in London and had some wonderful adventures in Rome.  I continued traveling a\
  \ bit and returned to Europe once or twice, including a romantic honeymoon in London\
  \ and Portugal, but had forgotten about the radio ad and Flight One.  \n\nIn February\
  \ 1996 excited as I could be in my new job as an Event Planner for a major computer\
  \ magazine, I was on my way to Bangalore, India for the first international meeting\
  \ I had organized.  Sitting in the Hong Kong Airport clutching my passport and boarding\
  \ pass, a bit dazed after an eleven-hour flight, I could believe my ears when I\
  \ heard my flight to Delhi announced:  Passengers for United Flight One please proceed\
  \ to your boarding gate.  I had waited 19 years and there I was boarding my dream\
  \ flight and yes, I did go all the way around the globe on that trip.  A dream came\
  \ true for me as it does every time I take a trip.  Any travel is my dream come\
  \ true, but Flight One was the biggest dream.  Lucky me."
