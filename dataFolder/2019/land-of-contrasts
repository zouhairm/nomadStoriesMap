Text: "Taking the ferry from Corfu to Saranda in Albania was a leap into the unknown.\
  \  While in Corfu I tried to learn some Greek from Andreas, the local chef and concierge\
  \ in one at the pink painted hostel I stayed. Basic words like \u201CHallo\u201D\
  , \u201CGood Day\u201D, \u201CThank You\u201D.  He tried to teach me after supper\
  \ and the dining room was emptying, but by my third pronunciation attempt to copy\
  \ him, he only shook his head and said: \u201CPlease don\u2019t say that to anyone.\
  \ That is no good. You will make the Greeks very angry.\u201D So I decided to rather\
  \ not work on my language skills when entering the unknown Albania, as I cannot\
  \ risk angering the Albanians after upsetting the Greek gods.\n\nBeforehand I have\
  \ not heard of any other South Africans visiting Albania. But this was also the\
  \ case for the official at the border post when our ferry entered Saranda. After\
  \ showing him my passport, he checked my passport and various visa stamps. And recheck\
  \ it. He checked his list of countries to enter Albania. Shook his head and went\
  \ to call another official. Still shaking his head, he returned to the misplaced\
  \  South African in front of him: \u201CDo you need a visa? I don\u2019t know if\
  \ you need a visa. Your country is not on my list.\u201D He reluctantly stamped\
  \ me in, even after trying to persuade him that Albania is one of the few countries\
  \ where South African citizens do not need a visa. \u201CBut why do you want to\
  \ come to Albania?\u201D\n\nEven the foreboding words of a border official could\
  \ not stop my sense for the unknown. Barely any information about Albania was available\
  \ to me before entering this country. I shall not recommend it to anyone without\
  \ a bold sense of adventure and unknown horizons. Someone with the curiosity of\
  \ adventure pulsating through their veins. This ex-communist regime country is not\
  \ yet tame enough for the first class comfort traveler. You get a rough introduction\
  \ to a third world country, specified as one of the \u2018bad lands\u2019 to visit\
  \ (or actually to avoid visiting), after being under the dictatorship of Enver over\
  \ 40 years, until 1985 with his death.  A nation today still without inner happiness\
  \ and trust of strangers, after years of oppression and being in the iron grip of\
  \ this longest reigning dictator. A land without any religion or culture since before\
  \ the Second World War, which can only be faintly remembered by scattered survivors\
  \ of the regime. \n\nAfter years of schedules, currently set rosters for buses or\
  \ other transport are only used as a guide. Distance can\u2019t be measured in kilometers\
  \ but rather the hours you would spent on the road between destinations. \u201C\
  Maybe five. Maybe six hours. You see when you get there.\u201D And then your only\
  \ choice is to step into this double glass window minibus \u2013 find a seat - to\
  \ arrive at your desired destination \u2026 eventually. \n\nBut Albania is a land\
  \ of contrasts. A place where nothing is as you would suspect or even imagine. Warning:\
  \ Do not enter with any predisposed ideas.\nIf you expect a village to be in lush\
  \ valleys, you will find it at the end of a winding road on top of a hilltop. \n\
  It will rain (pour down from the heavens above like tears), when you expect sunshine.\n\
  There will be snow on the mountains and ice filling the air, while the sun is shining\
  \ on your face.\nNodding your head means \u2018no\u2019 and shaking your head means\
  \ \u2018yes\u2019.\nWaffles and ice cream accompany cocktails and alcoholic drinks.\
  \ \nBus tickets are sold with seat numbers, but more seats are added into the bus\
  \ as more passengers are picked up along the route.\nA land of uncharted territory\
  \ for the traveler at heart, whom will use a guidebook only as a guide and wait\
  \ for the unknown to unfold in front of them."
