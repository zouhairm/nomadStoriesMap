Text: "I\u2019m late and I\u2019m lost. Not completely, but its 9:53 and I can\u2019\
  t find the correct street. I ask a man for directions, which is so not like me.\
  \ With French instructions and a hand gesture, he directs me left.\_Gauche. I make\
  \ a mental note to remember this for class, assuming I make it in time.\n\nI rush\
  \ to the corner and turn left. One more turn and I\u2019m home free! My mind is\
  \ jumbled and I\u2019m too disoriented to decide if my next turn is right or left,\
  \ so I go with my gut. I should know by now that 98% of the time going the opposite\
  \ way of my directional gut is the better move. And sure enough, half a block down,\
  \ it\u2019s clear I am going the wrong way. It\u2019s 9:57. People around me are\
  \ walking with purpose, probably to work, but I\u2019m too late to observe anything\
  \ more than their clothing. It\u2019s August in Paris and everyone is donning jackets\
  \ and scarves. It is a chilly 65ish degrees and flat-out cold for a Miamian like\
  \ myself. Despite the temperature, I am sweating and nervous.\n\nFinally, I see\
  \ my destination. An address marker! #3, right there like a shimmering ray of hope\
  \ that is instantly squashed when I stumble into a carpentry shop. \u201CStudio\
  \ de yoga?\u201D I blurt out in pure desperation and shamefully horrible French.\
  \ A woman walks me to the door and points to a gate, \u201Ca droite.\u201D On the\
  \ bright side, this particular journey is really expanding my French vocabulary.\
  \ I\u2019ve learned two very important words, right and left. \_\n\nInside the gate\
  \ there are doors everywhere. Like a bad dream, each one leads to an empty hall\
  \ or staircase. Sweat is beginning to spill down my temples, and my two-week diet\
  \ of baguettes, cheese and wine is revealing itself in the form of a queasy stomach.\
  \ My anxiety is high as I reach the final door, my last hope. I peer through the\
  \ glass and lock eyes with the petite yoga instructor. She\u2019s thin, with mousy\
  \ brown hair, a sloped nose, and deep-set eyes. I mouth \u201Cd\xE9sol\xE9\u201D\
  \ as I enter the lobby. 10:05. Five students, three women and two men, are moving\
  \ gracefully in perfect unison to the pattern of her French words. She glides over\
  \ to me and points to the mats, calmly and fluidly. I roll the silver mat against\
  \ the satin light wood floor and slip into my first down dog. Success.\n\nMy body\
  \ is tight and far from graceful. It feels good to be here, yet intimidating as\
  \ I understand nearly nothing. Feeling a little out of place, I decide to ignore\
  \ my anxieties and just do what I can, impressed by the way my body reacts naturally\
  \ to sounds I don\u2019t recognize. \u201CLa jambe gauche.\u201D A flash of comprehension\
  \ goes through my mind as I lift my left leg. \u201CVirabhadrasana\_deux.\u201D\
  \ Warrior two, left side. And \u201Ct\xEAte,\u201D that means \u201Chead.\u201D\
  \ Instinctively I respond. Respirez, expirez. Inhale, exhale. The rhythm of this\
  \ class envelopes me. We breathe and move together like a team, yet individually.\
  \ In this manner I follow the instructor's commands, picking up French words as\
  \ I go, stealing glances at my neighbors directly or in the reflections of the glass\
  \ windows surrounding the tranquil white studio. \n\nIn\_savasana, I observe an\
  \ undeniable feeling of glory and satisfaction welling up in my body at having completed\
  \ what I set out to do\u2014attend a yoga class in France taught totally in French.\
  \ A language of which I speak five words (well, now maybe seven). The three classes\
  \ I had attended prior to this one in Paris had, to my utter disappointment, been\
  \ conducted in partial or full English. Turns out most of the students attending\
  \ those studios were expats and English was the unifying language. Hearing English\
  \ in a Parisian studio made me feel surprisingly like an outsider. But inside this\
  \ studio, where the only words spoken were French or Sanskrit, I felt my most natural.\
  \ In this room I can hide my foreignness, and none of us here are French or American.\
  \ We are yogis."
