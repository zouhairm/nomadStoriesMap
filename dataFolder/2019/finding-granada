Text: "I didn\u2019t expect to find a city or a lifestyle I would miss so much.\n\n\
  In January of 2018, I set out for my first real and, so far, greatest travel journey\
  \ of my life for a semester abroad. The opportunity to travel abroad was something\
  \ I always wanted, and luckily, it was an experience I was able to pursue. So, on\
  \ January 14th, I took a plane to Spain and found a whole other side of my life.\
  \ It felt like this nueva vida was just there, waiting for me, and I dove right\
  \ into it, to say the least. \n\nGranada, Spain is a marvel. I traveled here once\
  \ during a high school trip, but, sadly, only for a day. I remembered I loved the\
  \ small city so much, though, so I chose to return here again, except, this time,\
  \ for about 4 months. I was placed in with a wonderful host mother, and my adventure\
  \ began. \n\nI started school, explored the city, made new friends, and tried to\
  \ live like a Spaniard. My Spanish speaking improved quickly, and I felt at ease\
  \ in the city. There was so much to do and explore like La Alhambra, an old Moorish\
  \ fortress, as well as beautiful gardens and miradors, or look out points. There\
  \ aren\u2019t enough words to describe the beauty and tranquility of the city, but\
  \ it\u2019s easy to understand. Imagine walking at 3 am along the Rio Genil, water\
  \ rushing coolly and quietly past, beautiful golden lamps lining the river, and\
  \ not a soul to be seen. Imagine beautiful and ancient buildings and walls just\
  \ scatted around the city, remembering the incredible history of the Moors and the\
  \ Christians. Imagine delicious tapas sweet and crisp, flavored blissfully and perfectly.\
  \ \n\nWhen it was time for me to go, I found I was actually quite devastated to\
  \ leave the city that I had grown so fond of. I had another great adventure I was\
  \ heading on, going to ten different cities in seven different countries over the\
  \ span of a month, and I was so excited for it, too. I even had a wonderful time\
  \ at each new location, but something I didn\u2019t realize would happen happened.\
  \ I would look up high past the skyline, toward mountains or fantastical buildings,\
  \ but I expected to see the Alhambra each time. And each time it wasn\u2019t there.\
  \ I felt like a part of me was hurting. I had grown so used to the view; really,\
  \ I had grown so used to everything: My mile walks to and from school each day,\
  \ my hot chocolate and churros at various cafes, long nights spent with amazing\
  \ friends, and the incredible history all around me. \n\nI never knew I could get\
  \ so attached to a place, to a culture, I had only known for such a little time.\
  \ It truly amazed me that I could feel so at home and so peaceful somewhere else\
  \ in the world. Now, it\u2019s a place I will always be fond of and will definitely\
  \ return to. I can\u2019t wait to run through the narrow streets of the Albaicin,\
  \ drift lazily through romantic palace gardens, and enjoy all the tapas there are\
  \ to offer. I can\u2019t wait to go back to the place I never expected to love so\
  \ much. Granada, te amo."
