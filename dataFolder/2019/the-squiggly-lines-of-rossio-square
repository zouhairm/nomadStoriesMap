Text: "Did you have a Women\u2019s Weekly Special Occasions cake book. Pages filled\
  \ with creative, colourful cakes topped with mouth watering treats. The same feeling\
  \ churns up when I think about Portugal. Turn your attention to the amalgamation\
  \ of buildings sploshed into one another. Splashed upon a big blue backdrop, the\
  \ houses are painted like pastel lollies. The sweet speckled ones that have love\
  \ messages etched into the sugar. Hues of tangerine and mint meld together in swirling\
  \ patterns and petruding structures. \nI have stepped into a dream drawn in crayons.\
  \ Portugal\u2019s playground of curiosity and wonder.  Sprawled upon the hills are\
  \ magnificent castles. Pena palace looks like an extravagant birthday cake, iced\
  \ with decorative furnishings. All the people meandering mindlessly about seem like\
  \ they are made of cake too, their licorice top hats and cream blouses. I float\
  \ around the echoing chambers, frolick through the manicured gardens. \nI stumbled\
  \ upon the eerie castle of Santa Maria da Feira. Gothic and mysterious with crumbling\
  \ bricks stained with age amongst emerald foliage. If this castle was a person I\
  \ imagine they would be a recluse. They would wear sensible brown leather shoes\
  \ and fold their newspaper neatly. Shadows falling on the gravel, the breeze flowing\
  \ through stone archways. \nA terra cotta pot castle watches over the river, it\u2019\
  s gingernut brickwork illuminated by the sun. The Castle of Almourol, a chamber\
  \ of light and energy. It is like an orange and poppyseed muffin. People gaze into\
  \ the surronding water, light wiggling on its gentle currents. \nThe squiggly lines\
  \ of Rossio Square. A vast court scattered with pedestrians. Bumbling about, sitting\
  \ on a bench eating a scrumptious pastry. When you squint, the ground is embellished\
  \ with squiggly lines. Like a bag of lolly snakes were dropped on the ground. I\
  \ trace the outline of the lines, stepping on the giant zebra crossing. \nA slice\
  \ of paradise. \n(Descriptions based purely off google images of Portuguese Castles)"
