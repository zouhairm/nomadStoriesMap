Text: "I bump my head on the bus window and wake up from a hazy dream. The 17-hour\
  \ ride from Mexico City has brought me all the way to Palenque, Chiapas, and the\
  \ drips running down my cheeks tell me I won\u2019t be needing my sweater anymore.\n\
  It\u2019s Christmas day and it\u2019s the first time I spend it away from my family.\
  \ My parents tried hard to dissuade me from travelling by myself: not for the travel\
  \ per se, but because of the destination and its implications for a girl\u2019s\
  \ safety.\nMexico scores a cringy 16th place among the countries with the highest\
  \ rate of violence against women, and I must admit the concern also affects me.\
  \ It\u2019s been stressful to be alone at some points during this month-long trip,\
  \ I was often tempted to while away the evenings in the hostel, or follow someone\
  \ else\u2019s itinerary to avoid being on my own.\n\nIt\u2019s been the most exciting\
  \ journey I had the chance to undertake, though, and I plan to spend my last week\
  \ at El Panchan, renowned hippy hideaway, sitting right below the world-famous archeological\
  \ site of Palenque. A weird ensemble of bungalows and cabins scattered underneath\
  \ a thick roof of cedars, mahoganies, and sapodilla trees, El Panchan looks otherworldly\
  \ to me. \nTired from the journey, I stop at Do\xF1a Felipa\u2019s to enjoy the\
  \ first jungle meal. I\u2019m halfway through a delicious mole verde when Samuel\
  \ comes over to greet me. Ear and nose expansions, longer-than-his-feet dreadlocks,\
  \ he introduces himself and after a little chat invites me to stay at his place\
  \ with a grin: some other backpackers are sleeping on the top floor of his bungalow\
  \ and he likes to have women around. \nI picture my mother screaming \u201CNever\
  \ accept anything from strangers, especially if men!\u201D, but Samuel seems well\
  \ known in El Panchan, and his cabin also hosts his hand-poked tattoo studio: the\
  \ lure of free accommodation ends my internal strife.\nLater on, I place a mat on\
  \ the wooden floor upstairs and catch up with the landlord and the crew gravitating\
  \ around the studio, some sleeping in small tents in the forest around it, some\
  \ on the hammocks downstairs. \nA few steps from the cabin, I notice a clearing\
  \ with the remains of a bonfire and the dome-shaped skeleton of what seems to be\
  \ a yurta. I ask Samuel about it: that is a Temazcal, he explains, a sweat-bath\
  \ performed in pre-hispanic cultures and handed down to the present as a powerful\
  \ purification ceremony to reconnect with the energy of nature and body. The temperature\
  \ reached during the hour-long celebration is almost unbearably hot, and it strikes\
  \ me when Samuel mentions Aztec women would also give birth inside it. \nI\u2019\
  ll be lucky enough to witness it, since he\u2019s holding a Temazcal that very afternoon\
  \ and wants his current guests to join.\n\nSamuel instructs us on the procedures:\
  \ normally the ceremony would be conducted by men, but he insists we break with\
  \ traditions. He invites the women to choose their roles: one will attend to the\
  \ fire, another purify the participants with resin, another place the volcanic rocks\
  \ at the centre of the structure with the aid of a stag\u2019s horns. \nThe ceremony\
  \ begins, we chant to the Earth, mother and woman, and when we kneel to enter the\
  \ Temazcal, we utter the Nahuatl word \u201COmeteotl\u201D: to enter a woman\u2019\
  s womb cannot be done without her \u201Cpermission\u201D. Samuel guides the ritual\
  \ in pitch dark and prays to this age, where women are waking up and fighting for\
  \ their place, where women are entitled to do everything they choose to. As sweat\
  \ runs down our bodies, we give thanks to the water, feminine presence who gives\
  \ life. Men are not allowed to sing or speak.\n\nOn the way out, we hug each other,\
  \ and feast on fresh fruit. I sit with Samuel and ask him why he cares so much about\
  \ including women in his life.\n\n\u201CPalenque\u2019s ancient name was Lakam Ha,\
  \ Big Water. Water means abundance, life. If we try to contain water, we try to\
  \ contain life, and so it is with women. That\u2019s why we need to leave both enough\
  \ space to flow\u201D."
