Text: "By the time when everything was kind of going well and settled down in my life\
  \ .. one day I woke up and had that : What If I\u2019m going to die today? - feeling.\
  \ What I\u2019m sure we all felt once in our life.\nThere are so many places that\
  \ I haven\u2019t seen yet. \nHowever this thought went away with the morning teeth\
  \ brush and I went to work.\nDuring my lunch break the thought came back and was\
  \ insulting me.\nSo I went  home and checked the tickets to Spain. Not because I\
  \ want to buy any just you know.... checking. \nHowever I found a very cheap one\
  \ and could book my holiday straight away with my manager.\nI was counting the days.\
  \ I felt energised and like we feel on our first date, you know... butterflies \U0001F98B\
  \ and everything. \nEveryone around me with who am I going to Barcelona. And I said:\
  \ alone.\nThey\u2019ve got shocked but I was so serious about it.\nAnd then the\
  \ day came and I was about to leave my room.\n I literally felt like is my last\
  \ trip and whatever will happen I will enjoy myself.\nArriving to the city I felt\
  \ a bit lost but my excitement didn\u2019t go away.\nSo I went to visit the first\
  \ restaurant and toke myself for a nice dinner. Was chatting with the waiter and\
  \ enjoying every bite.\nI think this is the most important lesson what I was learning\
  \ during on my holiday. \nYes I\u2019m still alive. \U0001F605\nSo the lesson for\
  \ me was to : learn how to enjoy your time with yourself. How to be excited for\
  \ to see the ocean or just to have a cocktail on the beach. How to make new friends\
  \ from strangers and laughing as you thought you would never do it again.\nIt was\
  \ such a lovely holiday both mentally and relaxed \U0001F60C as well. I think that\
  \ every holiday is depending on how you are setting up your mindset. So many people\
  \ are working as crazy for to go a holiday what will be all about the fights on\
  \ the plane \u2708\uFE0F or delay or which restaurant should go etc the list is\
  \ long. So instead of to plan your life and your holiday ahead with all the small\
  \ details I advice you to take a deep breath and leave your map at home and enjoy\
  \ your real holiday! The world is such an amazing place and we have so many place\
  \ to visit! Don\u2019t waste your time , just go!! \nBy the way there are some cheap\
  \ tickets to Bali... I\u2019m just saying \U0001F609"
