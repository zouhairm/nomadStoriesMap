Text: "I still don\u2019t know how it was possible, or how and why I was there. The\
  \ only thing that I knew it was that I wanted to discover the world. To be all I\
  \ wanted to, and not what people expected me to be. \nMy adventure in Galicia, Spain,\
  \ started like this. Just as a desire for a different life. \n\nSuddenly, after\
  \ a whole year of adventures, new friends, new places and a new life passed as if\
  \ they were just some minutes \u2013 amazing, unforgettable minutes of my life -\
  \ then, I felt something awesome and scared at the same time.\nThat day, I\u2019\
  ve had been spending all day exploring places that I didn\u2019t know before. Just\
  \ some words from a friend of mine \u2013 \u201Ccome with me, I want to show you\
  \ some places that I like\u201D \u2013 and a day full of surprises and incredible\
  \ connections started. \n\nAfter just a few minutes by car, we arrived at a gorgeous\
  \ natural paradise.\n\nThe splashing water of a little, graceful, see-through waterfall\
  \ brought me to a different world: no place for cars, music clubs, people talking\
  \ too loud; neither for problems, anxieties, bad feelings. Just the sound of the\
  \ water falling over the rocks and then go slowly down to create a little lake,\
  \ and the singing birds hidden in the trees. \n\nAnd then, a small route through\
  \ the little wood near the waterfall; the fresh summer air moving the tree branches;\
  \ the strange sound above my feet of a little old wood-made bridge; the romantic\
  \ picture of a little old house covered by green plants and the musk showing the\
  \ pass of the years. \n\nIt was just amazing. Sitting on one of the big red stones\
  \ above the tiny lake, I was unable to think about anything else that wasn\u2019\
  t how peaceful I felt. The time seemed as it didn\u2019t want to go on. It was a\
  \ relaxing break from all the normal life, a little piece of paradise where I can\
  \ just stay during all of my life. \n\nBut then, I understood that a connection\
  \ with a place could be deeper than I thought. \n\nI was sitting on the top of a\
  \ little mountain. On my right, the ocean. On my left, other little mountains and\
  \ a lot of tiny houses that could be seen just thanks to the light of the lamps\
  \ inside them. \nThere were so many shades in the sky that my eyes couldn\u2019\
  t catch them all. Probably it could be the most meaningful and beautiful sunset\
  \ that I\u2019ve ever seen. Focused on my feelings, I realised that there was something\
  \ inside me that I couldn\u2019t understand deeply: I was so happy and so sad at\
  \ the same time. \n\nDeeply connected with the nature around me, lost in that gorgeous\
  \ view, I burst into tears. \n\nThe top of that little mountain, as far from the\
  \ ocean as from the cities, with only a few trees and covered by a lot of wind turbines,\
  \ it will never disappear from my mind. It maybe could be my place in the world,\
  \ or not, but still a place that I have a very deep connection with.  \nAt the end\
  \ of the day, looking at the red violet and blue sky become one thing with the blue\
  \ ocean, erasing the line that made a difference between the blue sea-world and\
  \ the multicolour sky-world, I met myself. That feeling of harmony coming from the\
  \ end of the difference between those two worlds embraced me as if I was a part\
  \ of the natural landscape."
