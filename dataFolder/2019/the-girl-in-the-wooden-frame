Text: "\"I\u2019m basking in the sun, cuddled up in a specially curated seat on the\
  \ rooftop of a bus in a place amidst the Himalayas about a hundred and fifty kilometers\
  \ away from where I plan to be this afternoon. The trees are soaring the skies and\
  \ the traditional Daisies of Himachal bejewel every alternate bush.\" \n\nThis would\
  \ be an ideal description of what I was experiencing last November, except that\
  \ it was six am  and the sun was substituted by wind that chilled my bones, I was\
  \ cuddled up because I was petrified of falling off a really rusty rooftop, and\
  \ the seats weren\u2019t exactly what I\u2019d envisage seats to be, unless ropes\
  \ fastened from an end of the bus to the other pass as seats, I\u2019d call them\
  \ friction-facilitators that kept me from my demise, it wasn\u2019t all that special\
  \ either considering I was on the roof with at-least twenty other people on a bus\
  \ that wasn\u2019t a double-decker. I was left with only a hundred Indian rupees\
  \ and for the lack of a functional ATM at six thousand feet in Barot Valley, my\
  \ debit-card proved to be useless. I had four days before I could jump on a pre-booked\
  \ bus and travel back home. The bus took a sharp, unexpected turn as did my week.\n\
  \n I felt her hand latching onto my elbow, I glanced at Khando as she chuckled away\
  \ apologetically, all her twenty teeth plagued and crow\u2019s feet under her minute\
  \ eyes, a motherly affection trickled down her eyes in the form of crystal tears\
  \ for a split second before she gathered herself and apologised. She smelled of\
  \ the Tibetan perfume in my wardrobe back home, she reminded me of home. Khando\
  \ was 60 years old, but was by no means wan, full to the brim with conversations\
  \ that she wanted to pour out to me like a cup of coffee- more accurately cha suma\
  \ (butter tea), owing to her Tibetan roots. After Khando\u2019s bitter separation\
  \ from her country, she sought refuge in India but she never conformed to a community\
  \ life. Khando had never stayed in one place for more than six months since she\
  \ turned twenty-five, she\u2019d never gone a day without eating at least three\
  \ meals in the last thirty-five years of her life and the only way she\u2019d ever\
  \ earned any money was by cooking traditional Tibetan cuisine, anywhere she went,\
  \ as a reminder of home. Khando had truly learnt the art of finding refuge and not\
  \ seeking it. \n\nAt dawn the next day, she was going to start cooking in Bir. With\
  \ nipped fingers and toes, I slid the suggestion to her \u201CI\u2019d be happy\
  \ to help you set up\u201D, I didn\u2019t have to say much else, another bout of\
  \ motherhood came over her and drove the next few statements, \u201CI make delicious\
  \ food, I\u2019ll make some for you, my child\u201D. Moments later, she grew uneasy,\
  \ distanced herself and drew her stole over her eyes. Khando didn't say much until\
  \ we arrived in Bir,  the next few hours passed in trotting around the Tibetan settlement\
  \ and setting up. That night, Khando insisted that I sleep on her only mattress,\
  \ with her adjacent to me on the floor of her tiny, bare wooden hut. Crouched next\
  \ to her at eight, the next morning, hearing the sizzle of the thirty-inch wok between\
  \ us, I felt safe. The next four days, we  shared all our meals, with each meal\
  \ came a stroke of her hand through my hair and a gaze full of love. In a jiffy,\
  \ the spell was broken and it was now, time to leave, I caught Khando anxiously\
  \ rummaging through her timber trunk, out came a teakwood frame, lo and behold,\
  \ essentially a 12 year old me painted with a Tibetan brush, her daughter, the resemblance\
  \ was uncanny. I was in a tizzy, the last four days flashed before my eyes, everything\
  \ sunk in. I felt Khando\u2019s hand latch onto my elbow, I glanced at Khando as\
  \ her eyes watered apologetically, I held  her palms in both of mine and looked\
  \ deeply into her glistening eyes and at that moment, we were both at home, miles\
  \ away from it."
