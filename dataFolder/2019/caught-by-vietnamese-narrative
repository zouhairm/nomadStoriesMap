Text: "\"Morning. Is it correct that you have ordered Uber to the airport?\"\n\nAn\
  \ awakening-phone-call I received at 2 AM. I should catch my departure schedule\
  \ at 5:25 to Singapore before taking into another flight to Vietnam.\n\nVietnam.\n\
  \nIt always fascinated me when we're going to urban area. To see the \"development\"\
  \ in the forms of concrete and technologies. Match with my architecture degree which\
  \ I took for my graduate, even though I am now taking another course. But the fascination\
  \ remains.\n\nVietnam, to me, was Indonesia at the 1990s. Ho Chi Minh City, from\
  \ what I imagined, was a city that offers hedonism and wartime stories. I was clueless\
  \ about Hanoi. From small research, the itinerary would never far from temple and\
  \ rickshaws.\n\nI would be going to those two cities for five days.\n\nFact that\
  \ Vietnam is the second-largest coffee exporter in the world lift me. My colleagues\
  \ said venturing about coffee in Uncle Ho's country is something that worth to try.\n\
  \n\"Chicks wearing hot pants riding scooter is common in Saigon,\" said another\
  \ colleague.\n\nMaybe Vietnam wouldn't be so bad. Obviously, taking off with low\
  \ expectation often resulting in good thing. We, me and my spouse, began with Hanoi.\n\
  \nHanoi\nA gloomy and foggy day greeted us in Hanoi. It was 11 AM, feels like seven.\
  \ There, we will meet our guide, Nguyen Van Phong. In a country where seventy percent\
  \ of its population named Nguyen, he preferred to be called Phong.\n\n\"Nguyen is\
  \ family name. Van is gender identification. Tinh is for the opposite gender,\"\
  \ Phong said. \"The third is the given name.\"\n\nPhong took us to temples and old\
  \ quarter, as expected. What I didn't expect was the tourism industry were so well-developed.\
  \ It is easy to spot Tourist Information (TI) and local guides anywhere in the old\
  \ quarter. \n\nWe spent 6 hours wandering around the old quarter. A region that\
  \ clearly influenced by French. France occupied Indochina (Vietnam, Laos, and Cambodia)\
  \ during 19th century to 1954. Their influence was easily spotted through architecture,\
  \ promenade and bakery.\n\nCafe was easy to find in Hanoi. Sipping the \"ca phe\
  \ sua\", milk-coffee, while looking at the old quarter is a rendezvous to the past.\
  \ A dialogue between time. A bliss we had that we start to build expectation what's\
  \ on the south side.\n\nIn the third day, we're departing for Ho Chi Minh City,\
  \ or Saigon.\n\nSaigon\nThe southern part was more vibrant. The north were more\
  \ conservative to their southern counterparts. Order against chaos. Traffic, more\
  \ international brands and off course, chicks in hot pants roaming around, greeted\
  \ us in Saigon.\n\nWe met with our local guide, Hyu. He explained that Saigon divided\
  \ into districts. Downtown is District 1 and so on. Most of the tourists will go\
  \ into District 1 or 2. The backpackers haven with its infamous night life. But\
  \ we weren't here for the hedonist part.\n\nWe're here for \"ca phe sua da\" or\
  \ iced coffee in a hot and humid day in Saigon. We also here for the story they\
  \ have.\n\nFrench tourists want the story from the days of Indochina. They will\
  \ love to see that the old quarter is well conserved. American tourists want a piece\
  \ of history during the wartime. They will go to another well-preserved war sites\
  \ like Cu Chi. Some will fall for coffee, culinary, sex, or even communism. But\
  \ without a doubt that the largest Vietnam have to offer is their history.\n\nThis\
  \ is where they cleverly put local guides as narrator. A person who decide the narrative\
  \ context. Notion of how cleverly Vietnam prepared for this tourism-trend era.\n\
  \n\"What do you like from Vietnam?\" Hyu asked me.\n\nI said I was impressed by\
  \ Vietnam's tourism development. A country who moved toward tourism business indicate\
  \ they are taking off from basic necessities and has confidence to offer to their\
  \ guests. And this is clearly visible in Vietnam.\n\n\"Our rival is Phuket, and\
  \ Bangkok,\" Hyu added. Vietnam did what Thailand did. Promote the natural scenery,\
  \ culture, but also giving place for hedonism. They are on the parallel line with\
  \ Thailand.\n\n\"But we have historical narrative advantage,\" Hyu concluded."
