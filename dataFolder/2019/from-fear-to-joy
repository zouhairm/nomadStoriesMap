Text: "From fear to joy \n     I really love books. Just about when I turned ten,\
  \ books started to mean the world for me. Had anyone been living in a small Czech\
  \ village around 1988, they should hardly been surprised. Growing up in a communist\
  \ governed country kept the window of travelling opportunity almost shut, thus leaving\
  \ just a shuttered outlook at mostly grey and tedious landscape of other Soviet\
  \ satellites in Eastern Europe. \n      However, there was a way to explore the\
  \ vast of the world. Books quickly became return tickets for my trips and I still\
  \ love them for that. \u201EDer Goldene Pharao\u201C by Bruckner  and \u201EAfrica\u201C\
  \ by Wagner full of exotic drawings \u2013 that was kind of my Old Testament. The\
  \ pages full of travellers meeting the Maasai and Kenynan people; ancient pyramids,\
  \ deserts, forests, mountains, rivers, lakes but also humour, adventure, love, life\
  \ and death. I was truly fascinated by all of that.\n     Growing older, Jack London,\
  \ Rudyard Kipling and Arthur Ransome became the apostles of adventure for me \u2013\
  \ a young girl, longing for a change and true passion. \u201ESeek and ye shall find,\
  \ people say. But I think it was Ray Bradbury who found me. I do not remember the\
  \ first moment of coming across with his novels but from the time it happened, I\
  \ was able to travel far and far away, fly to the sky and walk with the others on\
  \ the surface of the unknown planets. Later, I dived into Discworld Series by Terry\
  \ Pratchett. \n     However, reading fantasy books sitting in a sofa will not prepare\
  \ anyone for real life. In fact, reading generally will not prepare you for life.\
  \ At least that was the lesson I learnt. Although my sofa-centred bookworm galaxy\
  \ could give me almost anything my soul prayed for, the answer to a most important\
  \ \u201CKnow Thyself\u201D riddle remained unrevealed. So, I had to find a hard\
  \ and long way to disclose the answer and reached out for it outside my comfort\
  \ and safe zone. \n     I was nineteen, sitting in an overseas plane overlooking\
  \ the never ending blue of the Atlantic. The very view was both breath-taking and\
  \ fearsome as it had mercilessly and with utmost urgency confronted my limited horizons.\
  \ I remember how the limitless vast of the ocean then first evoked a transcendent\
  \ dimension to my life. If the flight had shaken and amazed my senses and soul,\
  \ the three weeks stay in the USA that followed appeared to be a real earthquake\
  \ in my existing life.\n          I felt overwhelmed with my own sudden and up to\
  \ then unrevealed prejudices, fears and uncertainty that were instantly appearing\
  \ with everything I was surrounded. That everything was foremost new and unknown\
  \ to me; starting from a giant fridge and ending with a dazzling view from the top\
  \ of the twin skyscrapers that are no more\u2026 I can clearly recall my puzzled\
  \ feelings, the simultaneous presence of acceptance and rejection, my doors of perception\
  \ wide open and yet unable to comprehend the flow of images sounds and scents. \
  \ Every day a wall inside of me fell, yet two more arose.\n      It took several\
  \ years of inner transformation before fear of unknown was displaced with joy. One\
  \ of the teachers of pure amazement for me was Michelangelo and his Moses or Pietas\
  \ that I could see in Rome. Two marble blocks were transformed with Michelangelo\u2019\
  s hands into sculptures so soft and downy in details; the muscles of the arms and\
  \ the bones of the hands are of such beauty and perfection; true fascination and\
  \ joy for me that is hard to define but easy to recognise. \n      Wherever I go\
  \ now I know that I am not on the run away from myself because there is nowhere\
  \ to run to. It does not matter where we are but rather who we are. Our paths are\
  \ individual, yet interacting and mutually influencing. We are linked with others\
  \ and others are linked with us; all parts of omnipresent beautiful complexity called\
  \ the universe. Pratchett said:  \"Fantasy isn't just about wizards and silly wands.\
  \ It's about seeing the world from new directions\". If I could meet him in person,\
  \ I would shake his hand and said: \u201CYes, indeed.\u201D"
