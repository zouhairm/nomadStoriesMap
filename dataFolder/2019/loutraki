Text: "It was our last chance to see each other before he was conscripted to the Greek\
  \ army. The barracks that awaited him were a world away from the glittery turquoise\
  \ water that we were drifting on. I lifted handfuls and watched as the drops slipped\
  \ from my hands back into the sea. The Loutraki beach in Chania, Crete was the local\
  \ watering hole for my boyfriend, where he and friends would stop by after a long\
  \ day of studying or pass their weekends. For me, it was a safe haven, one where\
  \ the army didn\u2019t have to exist yet, and where I had a glimpse into the Greek\
  \ culture. I stood by him and his friends at the sun-loungers as they attempted\
  \ to teach me Greek curse words, and doubled over laughing when the ensuing effort\
  \ was a muddle of mispronunciation and a strong Irish accent. We tried to speak\
  \ in English. Tomas was the first one to attempt speaking to me.\n\u201CHello. How\
  \ are you?\u201D He was just as nervous anticipating my judgement of his language\
  \ skills as he was playful in taking center stage to entertain his on looking friends.\
  \ One of them shoved him teasingly on the shoulder, and another one, I presumed,\
  \ shouted for him to continue speaking. I looked at him blushing, feeling stupid,\
  \ and had a rush of annoyance towards myself for not knowing more Greek. \n Being\
  \ the only pale and blue eyed person on the beach, I seemed like a small alien amongst\
  \ the bronzed pack of boys surrounding me.  Nikolas, my boyfriend, joined in with\
  \ his friends asking me to recite any Greek he had taught me. The words I remembered?\
  \ Cat, puddle and wax. I somehow managed to mess up a simple hello each time I tried,\
  \ so I thought I\u2019d leave that one aside for a while. Being an Irish girl studying\
  \ in Paris I was accustomed to playing the foreigner, but through the eyes of the\
  \ Greeks I suddenly felt more fascinating and alive through their vivaciousness.\
  \ All I needed was an uplifting indie song and I would have felt like I was in a\
  \ coming of age movie, running around the beach for hours, laughing, swimming, finally\
  \ ordering food and realizing half way through a huge tuna salad that I was starving.\
  \ \nBeing a coffee lover, it didn\u2019t take much for Nikolas to convince me to\
  \ try out some Greek coffee. I ordered a freddo cappuccino and realized: French\
  \ coffee is nowhere near as strong as Greek coffee. I struggled making my way through\
  \ it, the only thing that helped was that its iciness was much needed in the strong\
  \ sun. I sipped my coffee, trying not to make a face as the bitterness hit my tongue\
  \ and listened to the rise and fall of Greek. As all young men in Greece are required\
  \ to do a year of military service, I stood by a group of boys who had either taken\
  \ a year out from education to \u2018get it over with\u2019 or those who were a\
  \ little lost with no future plans and had decided to further their careers in the\
  \ army. Tomas told me that he started off by serving food, and worked his way up\
  \ to being trained to be a pilot.\nTomas\u2019 eagerness leaped from his grin to\
  \ his eyes as he began to recount some of his favourite memories \u201COne day,\
  \ we dropped all the burgers on the way to kitchen. We were too scared that the\
  \ generals might shout at us so we served them anyways. One said it was the best\
  \ burger he\u2019d had in a long while. They were right in the dirt!\u201D He wiped\
  \ tears from his eyes, gleeful from reminiscing on his mischief. The boys stretched,\
  \ ran and tackled each other on the white sand and as I watched them my worries\
  \ drifted off. That is until, one of Nikolas\u2019 friends, Dimitris, warned me:\n\
  \u201CBe careful of his mother. Greek mothers always hate their son\u2019s girlfriends\u201D\
  \nI thought he might be teasing me, but as I was soon to find out, the girlfriend\
  \ does not exist in the eyes of the mother until the plate smashes."
