Text: "18 years old. An angel, crossed my path. Asked me to join an unforgettable\
  \ expirance. Travel across the world to find that Madrid was the most perfect place\
  \ that God could have ever created. The food. The people. The history. The fashion.\
  \ The music, their flamenco. The sangria, oh my lanta, their Sangria. #todiefor.\
  \  The magic on every corner. I have never experience something\u2019s so beautiful.\
  \ Creating memories at 18 years old across the world, was something that I could\
  \ have only dreamed of. \n\nWhen I was younger, we lived in Mexico. And like every\
  \ other family that comes to America, my mother wanted to give us a better future.\
  \ We had some very hard times, we are a family of five (including my mother). Oh\
  \ lord she is magic. She never made us feel like we were missing out in fancy, unnecessary\
  \ things. We always had genuine  love. As I was growing up, I met angels who later\
  \ played a big part on showing me parts of a world I could have only imagine in\
  \ my dreams. I started to see that the opportunities were endless and that no matter\
  \ how hard you have it. You are the only one that puts a limit. I guess I was lucky,\
  \ because I have the most incredible teacher of that in my life. She came to a country\
  \ with four kids, did not know the langue. Made something of herself and gave us\
  \ the tools to be who we are today. Now as adult I see that Life ain\u2019t nothing\
  \ but a chicken wing. \n\nThank you for your time."
