Text: "China: probably the only place where someone who is 5 foot tall is asked to\
  \ be a model. Just to clarify, I am 5 foot tall, and a few weeks prior, my friend\
  \ and I had been asked to \u2018model\u2019 for a electric scooter company by a\
  \ fellow intern of mine over \u2018weechat\u2019, a common form of online communication\
  \ used in China. I was staying in Qingdao, also known as the beer capital of China,\
  \ a huge plus for someone like myself. It is located at the coast of China so there\
  \ are plenty of beaches, and, according to locals, plenty of sharks too. \n\nNeither\
  \ my friend nor I had any previous modelling experience, and the group in charge\
  \ of this event also seemed quite new to the concept.  Already they were loading\
  \ drones, digital cameras and stands into the vehicles before Yong, the company\u2019\
  s manager, informed us of the itinerary for the day.\nYong drove us through the\
  \ roads of Qingdao and, if you have ever witnessed driving in Asia, you will know\
  \ it is both exciting and lethal to say the least. Amazingly there are not as many\
  \ accidents as you would think, considering driving mainly consists of randomly\
  \ swerving into different car lanes without any warning, with the majority of communication\
  \ consisting of blaring horns. \n\nWe were driving to the other side of Laoshan,\
  \ where I was staying, towards a pier which was not very busy. It was actually a\
  \ very scenic route and the sea was a clear crystal blue, which many people may\
  \ not expect considering the typecast of pollution within China. \n\nThe company\
  \ provided us with hoverboards, which we were to pose on. This was already a bit\
  \ of a problem, considering my friend and I both didn\u2019t know how to use one.\
  \ We did eventually manage to stand on the board and move around a bit without falling\
  \ off and breaking an arm, which was important as there didn\u2019t seem much of\
  \ emphasis on health and safety anyway.\n\nMy fellow \u2018model\u2019 friend was\
  \ quickly grasping how to balance on the hoverboard and, being overly confident,\
  \ almost threw himself into the sea. In a few seconds the group watched as he drove\
  \ full speed towards the end of the pier and shot off the hoverboard propelling\
  \ himself and the board towards the edge of the pier almost into the water. Needless\
  \ to say the device was removed from him after that and from me also. The hoverboard\
  \ was replaced with an electric scooter as it was believed I would be far more capable\
  \ of controlling that. Thankfully they were right.\n\nAt the beginning of the day\
  \ I had felt extremely awkward trying to pose on a device I couldn\u2019t even balance\
  \ on, but by the end I was too exhausted to over think how I looked. Despite what\
  \ I had originally thought, modelling really is very tiring. In case you\u2019re\
  \ wondering, I did see the finished photos, and I reluctantly showed the photos\
  \ to my family and friends who were eager to see.  After being subject to a few\
  \ too many jokes and some praise, I did realise the experience was a once in a lifetime\
  \ opportunity for someone as small as me. Plus, the best part is being able to tick\
  \ this off my bucket list, even if it was never initially there in the first place."
