Text: "Maria received us with the biggest smile on her face. The table was set for\
  \ us, there was cake and cheese. It was all very simple, but done with so much affection.\
  \ Those humble people made us feel like we were at home, even though we had never\
  \ seen each other before. And that's how I realized how you feel when you travel\
  \ through Brazilian countryside. Unexpectedly, we find affection and comfort in\
  \ the simplest places. The houses are very small, the climate is very dry, women\
  \ carry buckets of water on their heads, the trees are not green. Having a car is\
  \ a luxury, since the means of transportation there are basically the bicycle and\
  \ the horse-drawn. \n\nMaria's bar / restaurant was located in Xucur\xFA, a small\
  \ rural district that I had the chance to meet when I played in a traditional band\
  \ from my hometown. The band was invited to play at a religious festival there.\
  \ The journey was tiring, the road was not good, the bus was uncomfortable and we\
  \ did not stay in a hotel, we stayed in the only school that existed in Xucur\xFA\
  . All these apparent discomforts for us, accustomed to the comfort of our homes,\
  \ were preparing us for a singular experience: a real undressing of stigmas and\
  \ prejudices and a discovery of such rich traditions and culture. After all, I had\
  \ never imagined that a trip to such a small place would bring me so many reflections\
  \ and such a unique experience.\n\nWe woke up at 5 in the morning and we went early\
  \ to the streets, playing marches to wake people up, a tradition that still remains\
  \ in some small towns. Some of the elderly and children appeared in the windows\
  \ of their homes, still wearing their nightclothes and smiled at us. That was what\
  \ made it so rewarding to have woken up so early to do our work. The music ends\
  \ up doing things that we cannot explain. Different age groups are similarly involved\
  \ by it.\n\nIn the afternoon, the music also played its part, but this time with\
  \ a religious air. We played in a religious procession, with hundreds of people\
  \ following us all over the streets of the small town. Most of them wore white clothes\
  \ with a red band. Some elderly and adults were barefoot, making promises or thanking\
  \ the blessings they had in the year. I could notice that the religious procession\
  \ is one of the most important ceremonial elements in Christianity. People were\
  \ praying next to me and I imagined all the prayers being made in that moment marked\
  \ by faith, devotion and believing, even in adverse conditions as they are for people\
  \ living in the drought-stricken Brazilian northeast.\n\nThe sacred was giving way\
  \ to the popular during the night. After the mass, in the local church, a band played\
  \ \u201Cforr\xF3\u201D and people danced with the rhythm on their feet. The children\
  \ also had fun in some old parks assembled in the town square. They are a community\
  \ that strives to survive, but they also have joy in living, despite the adversities,\
  \ maintaining the religious and cultural tradition that had been passed down from\
  \ generation to generation.\n\nXucur\xFA is a traditional community so close to\
  \ my hometown. That was when I realized that to have an experience that makes us\
  \ leave our comfort zone and discover things that you did not imagine you do not\
  \ have to go very far. Sometimes it is on your side, silent, unexpected, unknown,\
  \ just waiting for you to open up for it."
