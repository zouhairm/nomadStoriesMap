Text: "Moments in our life \nIt can be counted by the happy moments in our life .\n\
  So we must see the best place to travel to go around to run away from our life and\
  \ the comfort zone we live .\nDo your best to travel even if in your mind so I wanna\
  \ to travel to all places Alexandria is a Mediterranean port city in Egypt. During\
  \ the Hellenistic period, it was home to a lighthouse ranking among the Seven Wonders\
  \ of the Ancient World as well as a storied library. Today the library is reincarnated\
  \ in the disc-shaped, ultramodern Bibliotheca Alexandrina. The city also has Greco-Roman\
  \ landmarks, old-world cafes and sandy beaches. Its 15th-century seafront Qaitbay\
  \ Citadel is now a museum.\tGet around\tEdit\nAlexandria is quite a long city; you\
  \ can get pretty much anywhere by using the local transportation available along\
  \ the Corniche.\n\nblack taxis are a good way to travel in the city, and a cheap\
  \ one as well. Be careful though: taxis will uniformly refuse to use meters (the\
  \ rates haven't been adjusted in years) and drivers love to take advantage of non-Alexandrians,\
  \ so it's best to agree on the fare before you get in. No taxi ride between any\
  \ two points in the city should cost more than 25LE. Alternately, if you are on\
  \ a day trip to Alexandria, hire a taxi outside the railway station for the day\
  \ and pay LE 10-15 per place. E.g., if you plan to see 5 places in 3-4 hours, pay\
  \ around LE 50-60 to the driver or LE 80-100 if you plan to see 8-10 places in 5-6\
  \ hours.\n\nTo get into a taxi, wave at the driver and yell the name of your destination.\
  \ If the driver agrees they would park at the side of the road as soon as possible.\
  \ Some taxis will stop to pick you up even if they already have a passenger, but\
  \ such offers are best refused. Futhermore, always check back once you get out of\
  \ the taxi, there is no number to call if you lose anything of value, and nearly\
  \ no chances of having it returned.\n\nFast Call taxis can be booked by phone at\
  \ 19559 or 0800-999-9999 (toll free). These are pricier but generally much better\
  \ than ordinary black and and bright yellow cabs.\n\nBy tram\tEdit\n\nCity Line\
  \ (yellow) tram and a Taxi\nAlexandria has a creaky, slow but very cheap tram system\
  \ that dates back to 1860 and looks the part \u2014 it's the oldest one still running\
  \ in Africa. The route map is remarkably confusing and changes on a regular basis,\
  \ but one factor stays constant: the network is split into the interurban Ramleh\
  \ Lines (Tram el-Raml), which use blue-and-cream trams and run across the city a\
  \ few blocks back from the sea towards the eastern suburbs, and the City Lines (Tram\
  \ el-Madina), which use bright yellow trams and run west and south of central Alex.\
  \ The two meet at Raml Station (\u0645\u062D\u0637\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u0631\u0645\
  \u0644 Mahattat el-Raml), right at the heart of Alex. For both lines, the flat fare\
  \ is a whopping 50 piasters (~US$0.05), and tickets can be bought on board. Note\
  \ that the first car (out of three) in the blue trams is reserved for women only.\n\
  \nProbably the most useful service for tourists is yellow tram #25, which runs from\
  \ Raml Station to Ras el-Tin and Fort Qait Bey. You can also hop on any blue tram\
  \ west from Sidr Gabr bus/railway station to get to Raml, centered around the natural\
  \ gas industry. A few expatriates work in this section. This section is increasing\
  \ now as many new factories are built in Borg el Arab.\n\nOther than that, there\
  \ are some but not many international schools that employ expatriate teachers. Generally\
  \ they pay less than the much more lucrative educational section in Cairo.\n\nAlexandria\
  \ has got quite a large number of language schools. You can find girls-only, boys-only\
  \ and mixed schools. Also international certificates -like the IGCSE or the American\
  \ SAT I and SAT II- could be completed in most of these schools. Moreover, study\
  \ is available in English, French and also German.\n\nexandria is famous for having\
  \ the best seafood restaurants in the country.  Alexan"
