Text: "I have been in the elite athlete system for the sport of water polo for 8 years\
  \ now, and that means lots of travel around the world. Travelling and adapting to\
  \ different cultures constantly was a tough but rewarding process, and one which\
  \ still to this day, I cherish. Having the capacity to adapt and be flexible wherever\
  \ you go in this contrasting world, is a value that I and many others uphold and\
  \ are fortunate enough to have. After many years of travelling, I decided to spend\
  \ one year in Nice, France, playing water polo professionally, and this year (2018/2019)\
  \ in Bordeaux, France. After my time in Nice, the French culture and way of life\
  \ spoke to me like no other culture had before. An easy going way of life, however\
  \ still able to get work done when required. \n\nBefore I left my home country of\
  \ Australia, I had no idea what to expect. Little old me, just 17 years old, just\
  \ finished school and moving away from my family for 9 months to pursue a life-long\
  \ dream of playing my chosen sport at a professional level, what an exciting prospect!!\
  \ To be honest with you, the first month was tough mentally, being away from family\
  \ and leaping in to an unknown universe; new culture, different language, living\
  \ alone, all those things. However, after the first month had passed, I realised\
  \ that I had one of the best opportunities I could have ever asked for. To embrace\
  \ the new culture and the new language, make new friends and live a life only my\
  \ friends had dreamed of. 9 months later, I returned home to Perth, got a part-time\
  \ job and resumed by studies at university...until May 2018. \n\nMay 2018. What\
  \ a time in my life. I had been working for 2 years, great job and loved it, but\
  \ not as much as if I were to travel. I got on social media, messaged some water\
  \ polo clubs in Europe and lucky for me, the club in Bordeaux replied and asked\
  \ me to come for a trial week mid-May. I relished this opportunity as it allowed\
  \ me the chance to travel and showcase my skills. I spent the week in Bordeaux,\
  \ and again, a leap in to the unknown, same country but different culture and atmosphere.\
  \ After my week here, I took the opportunity to travel to Brussels, Prague and Warsaw\
  \ and what beautiful cities they are. Architecture, culture, people, food, and an\
  \ overall positive vibe. I came home for 3 months, before taking up my contract\
  \ in Bordeaux, and as I write my travel story, this Sunday morning from my apartment\
  \ in central Bordeaux, I would not change anything about my travel past.\n\nTravelling\
  \ from such a young age instilled the travel bug in me, and boy am I glad it was.\
  \ Taking a leap in to the unknown is what makes travel fun for me, taking every\
  \ moment as it comes. Having the ability to adapt to each individual I meet on the\
  \ road helps me to make new friends and keep life-long connections around the world."
