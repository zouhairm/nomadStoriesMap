Text: "With easy laughter, using backpack and barefeet I am able to dive into the\
  \ most different cultures in search of refuge to supply my entire thirst for knowledge.\
  \ It was with that feeling in mind that I set up my next stop: South Africa.\n \u201C\
  Swallowing the world\u201D is an expression which always  has made a lot of sense\
  \ to me. After all, there is a lot of \"world\" in the world to be limited to the\
  \ continental barriers imposed by an ID.\nThen, It was on Route Garden, with the\
  \ sun beating on the glass and with my son sitting in the back seat of my car that\
  \ I connected with my particular world projected into perspective for myself.\n\
  I had just been divorced, and although marriage status never affected my sense of\
  \ freedom, I realized that traveling allowed me to make connections with the deeper,\
  \ unfamiliar part of my own self.\nIt was 20 days away from home and all those who\
  \ always gave me a sense of security. Suddenly, I discovered that \"home\" is any\
  \ place where your heart feels filled.\nI dived deeply in body and soul on my trip\
  \ down the coast of South Africa. I admired the tranquility of the elephants in\
  \ Knysna, smiled at the fury of the encounter of the river with the sea in the Tsitsikamma,\
  \ I had danced the innocence of my son with the music of striking beat in Mossel\
  \ Bay and I found myself as owner of me when I had reached Agulhas Cape.\nI found\
  \ myself as owner of me, facing the meeting of two oceans. This scenario make me\
  \ realized my smallness in a world full of differences and connections. How could\
  \ I compare myself to the meeting of two marvelous oceans? How ambitious of me?\
  \ Two oceans with different continental coast battering missions are able to be\
  \ connected by a larger goal of covering a planet's wealthy 2 billion people with\
  \ water. Why should I be the son of Ramses who considered the necessity of connection\
  \ with a single individual a matter of necessity?\nJeffreys Bay showed me that surf\
  \ on its beaches is not a talent. It's a matter of being. It is a matter of life\u2019\
  s granting, not obligatory. Our nature, as well as bravery, allows us to enter the\
  \ depths of another person and it is up to us to stand or not, providing us with\
  \ a universe of others. It's about willing, not about gift.\nWith a clear conscience\
  \ and a light heart, I headed towards Cape Town with the certainty that as Mandela\
  \ said \"No one is born hating another person for the color of their skin, for their\
  \ origin or even for their religion. To hate, people need to learn, and if they\
  \ can learn to hate, they can be taught to love. \"\nI learned to love the ending\
  \ of a chapter of my life, to ensure that I became the true captain of my soul.\n\
  I arrived in Cape Town free to love, detached from my vanities and skeptical that\
  \ human imperfections are inherent in our nature. Forgiveness freed my soul and\
  \ drove me away from the fear of being happy. And then, overlooking the Cape of\
  \ Good Hope, that I determined that after South Africa had touched my heart I would\
  \ never be the same again.\nI was not prepared for it, I do not think my son was\
  \ prepared for my transformation either. However, life has these things. There are\
  \ people who mess with us, but there are places that fix us. South Africa has made\
  \ me a better person, not for myself but for the world. More compliant, truly open\
  \ to the other culture. The culture of each individual."
