Text: "There is something so inherently beautiful about this country, something that\
  \ is so unique and ancient and new all at once -- and that\u2019s what has struck\
  \ me the most on this trip thus far: how the old and new can exist so harmoniously\
  \ together and become something different, something better.  It\u2019s something\
  \ I\u2019ve never had the opportunity to witness, but I suppose that\u2019s the\
  \ story of the Jews: tradition and an unyielding way of life that is so resilient\
  \ it can withstand basically anything, yet flexible enough to adapt and morph with\
  \ the times to keep from being obsolete.  In the Old City of Jerusalem, I was constantly\
  \ aware of the people who had once stood where I was standing and lived and existed\
  \ in the same space as me.  At the same time, however, there was a modernity to\
  \ everything that existed in a realm of its own.  It was like two moments on a timeline\
  \ had intersected.  There were ancient things everywhere being restored and excavated\
  \ or they were simply left alone to be gazed upon, undisturbed.  Then, there were\
  \ places to sit with umbrellas and cafes and places to charge your phone.  The City\
  \ of David consisted of stairs with metal grating to take a peek into the past that\
  \ lay below your feet, and an oppressive heat that never seemed to give.  My shirt\
  \ clung to my back where my backpack rested and eventually I had to put my hat on\
  \ because there was absolutely no way I wasn\u2019t going to get sunburned.  And\
  \ then once you left the center of the Old City and decided to be done with the\
  \ hot holiness that surrounds you, the Jewish Quarter was almost all covered by\
  \ itself.  A labyrinth of tan and stone and walls that should have been in museums\
  \ themselves.  The columns that we stopped at were Roman-era and yet we could just\
  \ lean against them as if they were simply concrete or air or nothing at all.  Though,\
  \ I suppose that\u2019s a totally normal thing for people who live here.  You kick\
  \ a pebble and find something ancient.  Meanwhile even that pebble is a sacred artifact\
  \ to me and even that must be preserved.  There was something so hands-on about\
  \ being there, though.  There was no glass or red tape tied neatly in a bow.  Every\
  \ moment spent too long in a museum hall came pouring back to my brain as I recalled\
  \ those lingering stares at an object far older than I could ever imagine.  All\
  \ of those gloriously old things, however, are made of stone and mortar and sweat.\
  \  No wizard imbued the molecules with a cure for the human condition.  They are\
  \ only valuable because we assign them meaning and we feel things because of them.\
  \  They whisper stories of the past and of the present and of where those two things\
  \ might be able to meet, and that, to me, is more valuable than any paycheck, any\
  \ cup of coffee or shopping trip to the mall or beautifully written book.  I was\
  \ struck with this in this old yet incredibly new country, but my feet were dirty\
  \ and the grime mixed with the sweat on my brow and when I sat in a chair or on\
  \ a bench or perched upon some stairs, it was the sweet release of any tensions\
  \ I may have held that filled my senses instead."
