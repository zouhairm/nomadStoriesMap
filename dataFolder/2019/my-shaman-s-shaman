Text: "His eyes gleamed from time spent in far off realms. He interrupted his own\
  \ sentences to whistle with the birds. He walked through his jungle garden naked,\
  \ nibbling living leaves for breakfast. He awoke from dreams with melodies taught\
  \ to him by the trees, then sang them to the drooling gringos passed out on bamboo\
  \ mats on the floor. His name was Godofredo, and he was my shaman.\n     He led\
  \ me an hour's walk through the Peruvian jungle, machete dragging along the path\
  \ behind him carving a snake in the dirt. The sight made me uneasy -- I would have\
  \ preferred a bit more small talk before whipping out blades. At last he came to\
  \ a stop. \u201CWelcome to my garden,\u201D he said, waving the machete enthusiastically\
  \ at a plot of tangled green which appeared in no way different from the rest of\
  \ the forest. \n     Ayahuasca is consumed only at night when the darkness facilitates\
  \ the deepest visions, and so we spent the sunlit hours wandering through his garden\
  \ as he elucidated the wonders of the spirit world. What I lacked in comprehension\
  \ I made up for with much smiling and nodding.\n     We bathed naked in the river.\
  \ I am not the type to skinny dip with only another man for company, but something\
  \ about Godofredo\u2019s garden put me incredibly at ease. The birdsong, the insect\
  \ chirps, the monkey calls -- the anxieties of the civilization had vanished with\
  \ its rumbles and roars. Even the gleam of the machete now seemed a friendly wink.\n\
  \     \"Don't forget to clean your bottom,\" Godofredo said helpfully.\n     \n\
  \     The green jungle turned orange then purple then could not be seen at all.\
  \  At last he poured the drink. After whispering a blessing, he passed the sawed-off\
  \ coconut cup to me. I gazed queasily into the brown brew.\n     \u201CTake it in\
  \ one gulp,\u201D he advised.\n     Instead, I sipped. The taste was revolting:\
  \ a health-shop smoothie gone wrong, then forgotten about and left to ferment for\
  \ a year in the jungle. Now I couldn\u2019t even look at the stuff without shuddering.\n\
  \     He laughed at the familiar sight: another gagging gringo. Pinching my nose,\
  \ I managed to choke it down.\n     Later, the visions started. They were incredible,\
  \ but I will not describe them, because I have learned from experience that nothing\
  \ is more boring than enduring the telling of someone else\u2019s visions. Suffice\
  \ it to say, what I\u2019d heard about ayahuasca proved accurate: \u201CTen years\
  \ of psychotherapy in a single day,\u201D \u201CLike exfoliating the soul,\u201D\
  \ and so on.\n\n      Deep in the night, when the experience had mellowed, I grabbed\
  \ a detuned rusted guitar from the wall and began to noodle. The music was atrocious,\
  \ but Godofredo\u2019s eyes misted over with moonlight.\n     \u201CMy wife and\
  \ my daughter went to live in the city,\u201D he said. \u201CThey don\u2019t like\
  \ the forest.\u201D\n      I said nothing, only continued my dissonant plucking.\n\
  \      \u201CBut I hate the city,\u201D he said. \u201CIt\u2019s so loud, and the\
  \ ayahuasca has made me sensitive.\u201D\n      I made a move to set down the guitar,\
  \ sensing that the ugly music had soured him, but he said, \u201CPlease don\u2019\
  t stop.\u201D\n     Just as a doctor may fall ill, a shaman too may find himself\
  \ with a broken soul, and so to the lingering stench of vomit, Godofredo expounded\
  \ upon the woes of shamanic life.  On ayahuasca, time oozes like the thick sap of\
  \ the rubber tree, and his soliloquy seemed to last a short eternity. He mumbled,\
  \ barely opening his mouth, as if the words were directed back inward to the same\
  \ source which produced them.  Then he looked me straight in the eye and spoke his\
  \ first clear sentence: \u201CYou are like a brother to me.\u201D\n       I had\
  \ said no more than thirty words to him that day in broken Spanish. And yet, at\
  \ that moment, it was true: we were brothers.  Maybe it was not my words which had\
  \ turned us into family, but my silence. \n       We had met with an awkward handshake,\
  \ but we parted the next day with a hug. I vowed to come see him again, and I meant\
  \ it sincerely. But that was nine years ago. When the ayahuasca wears off, time\
  \ has a funny way of passing."
