Text: "Being naturally stubborn when my friend said, \u201CJamie, you can\u2019t do\
  \ it. I won\u2019t be able to help you,\u201D I waved her away.  My intuition screamed\
  \ \u201CNOT a good idea\u201D, but my heart swam alongside the crystal-teal colored\
  \ waters as the sound of the ocean floated in and out.\n\nI was visiting a beach\
  \ on the island of Karpathos, Greece, far away from anything that had caused me\
  \ stress back home.  The warm summer sun kissed my eyelids.  The salty, gorgeous\
  \ ocean tickled my feet; I actually felt invincible.  The water glided through my\
  \ fingers and the sun began to set.  Being a natural risk taker, without having\
  \ swum in an ocean for years, I forced myself pounce off the cliffs outlining the\
  \ ocean.   With ferocious courage, my friend and I danced through our newfound tranquility\
  \ and leaped into the unknown.  Halfway out into our two-hour swim, with everyone\
  \ gathering their stuff and departing like small ants, I became utterly helpless\
  \ and my lungs filled with heavy rocks.  I gasped for air as my friend squinted\
  \ back her fear and we faced my near-death experience. \n\nThe calming waters turned\
  \ into a menacing black hole.  The twinkle of the sunlight faded behind hazy clouds.\
  \  My friend and I were in the middle of the ocean, no one in sight, and I felt\
  \ like my body was being pulled down by a heavy anchor.\n\n\u201CI need help,\u201D\
  \ I cried out, \u201CI can\u2019t breathe, my-my asthma...my inhaler is on the other\
  \ beach!\u201D\n\nWith our collective lack of muscle, I felt hopeless.  I pushed\
  \ against the waves that were pulling me deeper into the haunting ocean.  We were\
  \ blinded by our dizziness.  We looked around for help and found it in the most\
  \ unexpected of ways.  My friend floated onto her back to regain strength, stuttering\
  \ some motivational words, and as if my day couldn\u2019t get any worse, when I\
  \ popped up to take a breath of air, I came face to face with a jiggly, uncovered\
  \ behind.  I gagged\u2013 a further hindrance to my ability to breathe, but was\
  \ unnoticed by the man.  The vivid imagery and shock replaced my terror and anxiety.\
  \  I gasped and looked ahead to see that I was so close to shore.  With the limited\
  \ strength I had left, I looked above into the gaps of mountains that carried boundless\
  \ energy.  I became lured in by the majestic beauty and freedom of the nature surrounding\
  \ me.  With all of my strength, I floated most of the rest of the way back, and\
  \ before I knew it, I was on the other beach with my friend hand-in-hand, laughing\
  \ eyes, and shaky, panicked breaths.\n\nWe finally took a moment to look around.\
  \  Left behind were trails of beaten up shorts and a soddened pair of goggles. \
  \ Sitting several feet away was the naked man\u2013 calm and enthused by the spectacle\
  \ the waves were carrying.  It didn\u2019t take long for us to realize we were on\
  \ a nude beach with only my friend, myself, and the naked stranger.  Only a few\
  \ short moments later did we realize the only way back to the mainland was through\
  \ swimming the two hours back to the other side of the beach.  Unfortunately for\
  \ us, the naked man began to leave and I was forced to rush after him because if\
  \ I were to drown, he would be my only savior.  In just a few moments, he was far\
  \ out of reach and I saw the dread appear on my friend\u2019s face.  My friend couldn\u2019\
  t help me\u2013 she was too weak to get us both back to shore.  This knowledge pushed\
  \ me past my limitations; I was on a mission.  The sun had set, my heart and adrenaline\
  \ pumped loudly in my veins, and the wind picked up causing the waves to roar. \
  \ My breathing was erratic, vision blurry, and just as my hope was beginning to\
  \ vanish, we arrived safely back at shore.  With a limited grasp of the risky adventure\
  \ we just pursued, we gathered our stuff and beamed with gratitude for the story\
  \ Greece gifted us."
