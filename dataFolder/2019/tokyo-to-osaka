Text: "I didn\u2019t expect to find myself on the 24th floor of a Tokyo high-rise\
  \ during the biggest earthquake of our time. I had expected to be in the \u201C\
  Big One\u201D at some point. But not here. In California, where I\u2019m from. I\
  \ stood frozen, contemplating the sound of the building as it creaked and swayed.\
  \ I wasn\u2019t afraid, I was just listening. Was this what a building sounded like\
  \ before it failed? It wasn\u2019t, but large cracks crept into the plaster walls.\
  \ A plume of black smoke rose up from behind Tokyo Tower in the distance. When the\
  \ ground stopped shaking, I leapt into action and raced to call Mama back home.\
  \ She answered. \u201CMama,\u201D I said, quickly. \u201CThere was just an earthquake.\
  \ It was big. I am ok. I just wanted to let you know. I\u2019ll call you again later.\u201D\
  \ This was before word of the tsunami broke. This was before Fukushima. This was\
  \ before a lot of things. The room began to shift under my feet again. The power\
  \ went out. I needed to get out of here. I ran from the apartment and raced down\
  \ twenty four flights of stairs. The corridor groaned as I dashed past. I pushed\
  \ open the emergency exit and daylight flooded in. People mingled outside, inspecting\
  \ cracks, awaiting the next aftershock. Birds chirped. It was a lovely spring day.\
  \ A well dressed Japanese woman in a smart cream skirt and blazer strutted past,\
  \ her heels snapping across the pavement. Her face seemed perfectly serene. Only\
  \ the orange hardhat perched atop her gleaming black hair gave away that something\
  \ was amiss. That I hadn\u2019t just made all of this up. I found someone who spoke\
  \ English, an expat middle aged woman from the Bay Area. \n\n\u201CHow big was that?!\u201D\
  \ I asked, my voice betraying my agitation. \n\n\u201CA 5,\u201D she replied. \n\
  \n\u201CNo way,\u201D I countered. \u201CThat was not a 5.\u201D \n\n\u201CThe Japanese\
  \ have a different system of measurement here. A 5 is the maximum.\u201D \n\nThis\
  \ answer made more sense but still made me frown and still didn\u2019t answer my\
  \ question. The aftershocks were relentless and earthquakes in their own right.\
  \ 6.0, 4.5, 7.2, 5.0. The ground never stopped moving. Rolling blackouts swept from\
  \ neighborhood to neighborhood. My legs ached from bracing against the constant\
  \ tremors underfoot. By the end of the afternoon, the markets were bare. By the\
  \ end of the day, word of the tsunami had spread. By nightfall, there were whispers\
  \ about some issue with a nuclear reactor up north. Yet somehow, no one panicked.\
  \ No one cut in line. Everyone waited their turn, even if that meant going hungry\
  \ because the person in front of you had taken the last package of ramen. This was\
  \ controlled chaos. This was Japan. At daybreak, the whispers about the reactor\
  \ had turned into heated arguments over wind direction. If the wind kept blowing\
  \ north, we were fine. But I knew we weren\u2019t fine. I knew it was time to go.\
  \ I had just gotten here though. I had planned to stay a while. Learn about the\
  \ culture, take my time, see the cherry blossoms. I had just gotten over my jet\
  \ lag. All I had done so far was go to the grocery store twice. But now I had to\
  \ leave. I called it a day trip as I packed my little suitcase. I would head to\
  \ Mount Fuji, a few hours drive from here. I would see if the news got better from\
  \ there. As I left Tokyo, armed guards greeted me at each intersection. They were\
  \ about to set up those metal gate blockades. There\u2019s no way to evacuate a\
  \ city like Tokyo. You would just have to shut it down. And that\u2019s what they\
  \ were getting ready to do. Yet still, the streets were otherwise peaceful. There\
  \ was no mass exodus. Just me, the guards, and their barricades. By the time I reached\
  \ Mount Fuji the first reactor had exploded. I stood in front of Lake Yamanaka,\
  \ the iconic snow capped mountain rising up behind me. I knew I wasn\u2019t going\
  \ back. I was now a tourist and a refugee. I got back in the car and headed west."
