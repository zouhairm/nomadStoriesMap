Text: "The Awakening\n\nEveryone has an opinion on Kashmir. I never had one until\
  \ that evening when I went walking along the deserted roads of Ladakh, bordered\
  \ by beautiful poplar trees, occasionally welcomed by mini-streams of water against\
  \ the backdrop of the sunlit mountain caps. Ladakh hit me with its ruthless chill\
  \ and despite my jacket, gloves & snow boots, my face had turned a strange shade\
  \ of crimson. The skies were an array of red, orange, yellow and blue; the sun was\
  \ retiring for the night. Instead of admiring this rare peaceful sight, my solo\
  \ traveller instincts kept telling me something bad was about to happen. I spotted\
  \ a lone woman shutting down her vegetable shop at the corner of the otherwise busy\
  \ Leh market. \n\u201CJhulley! Is today a bandh?\u201D, I asked her, trying to smile\
  \ and be non-intrusive at the same time.  \n\u201CJhulley! Yes, everything is bandh\u201D\
  , she responded coldly. \u201CSome tension at the village. Get back to your hotel.\u201D\
  \ \n\u201CWhat happened?\u201D I inquired.\n\u201CGo\u201D, she said, sharply cutting\
  \ me off, and continued to pack up. I was not aware Ladakhis had the ability to\
  \ be rude. \nI turned around to get to my homestay, a good fifteen-minute walk away\
  \ when I saw three middle-aged women marching across the road hurriedly. Before\
  \ I realized it, I had changed direction in order to follow them.\nI followed as\
  \ fast as my feet would take me, hauling my seven-layer winter wear along the rough\
  \ terrain of Leh. I could hear sounds, a group of people mumbling, that turned into\
  \ shouting as I inched closer to the spot. The three women had come to join a mob\
  \ of people, as part of a protest. They spoke in the local Ladakhi language, but\
  \ I could sense rage. I cut through the crowd and realized there were a lot more\
  \ people than I imagined. There were men, women and many teenage girls.\nThe mob\
  \ was in front of a mossy building that looked like it belonged to the Government.\
  \ There were some barricades laid out to prevent people from getting too close to\
  \ the entrance. A dozen uniformed army men with guns, stood poised to strike. Another\
  \ aggravated senior officer was having a dialogue with a few men. There was palpable\
  \ tension in the atmosphere, and I could feel the powerlessness of the mob though\
  \ they were larger in numbers than the army.  \nMy instincts told me to walk away\
  \ and find shelter in a safe place. But something else told me I needed to find\
  \ out what happened, and witness this. I was not afraid of the mob; if you have\
  \ ever met people from Ladakh you would know they mean no harm. I realized I was\
  \ afraid of the guns, and the uniforms. It struck me then that I was just a naive\
  \ tourist who thought she knew the place, the people, their kindness, and their\
  \ lives. \nI didn\u2019t expect to find this. A life of constant turmoil in a disputed\
  \ land where innocent people were trapped between terrorists and the military. I\
  \ suddenly realized my travels had not prepared me for this. The harsh reality of\
  \ the mountains. Years of living around security forces and barely remembering what\
  \ normal life was. Always having your guard up. Always staying out of trouble. Giving\
  \ up childhood way too soon to become confused teenagers and then embattled adults,\
  \ all victims of circumstances. \nI found a teenage boy staring curiously at me\
  \ and asked him if he could explain what was going on here. As he spoke coldly,\
  \ I could feel a different kind of chill spreading through me. \u201CA girl from\
  \ our village was molested by a member of the forces. She is fifteen years old and\
  \ not the first one to go through this.\u201D \nAt that exact moment, I heard people\
  \ screaming and running across the road, away from the building. I turned and saw\
  \ tear gas shells being thrown to diffuse the mob. It was mayhem. I looked around\
  \ frantically, not knowing which way to run when a cold, firm hand grabbed my wrist.\
  \ I turned around and heard a familiar female voice speak, \u201CI told you to get\
  \ home! This way.\u201D"
