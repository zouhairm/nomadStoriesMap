Text: "It was about eight o'clock in the morning when the plane began to descend and\
  \ fly over Vilnius. The sun was beating on the window when the clouds began to give\
  \ way to the colors of the city, full of trees with leaves yellowed by autumn. I\
  \ felt like the city was saying \u201Cwelcome\u201D, as I was the first family member\
  \ to return to Lithuania since my great-grandfathers left the country, 92 years\
  \ ago, looking for a better life.\nUpon landing at the Vilnius small airport, I\
  \ took a bus, which left me in the historical center of the city in a few minutes.\
  \ With a backpack, I took my first steps in search of my roots. It was a beautiful\
  \ sunny day, that contradicted the preconception that the Baltic countries are cold\
  \ and colorless.\nMy ears led me to the first surprise: a pair of elderly men, sitting\
  \ on a bench, were playing lively notes of music. Meanwhile, people were walking\
  \ distractedly through the streets, which were covered with leaves from the trees.\
  \ \nIn a hidden street of the historical center, I found the small hotel where I\
  \ would spend the next two nights. Simple, but cozy, with objects and smells that\
  \ reminded me of my grandmother's house (daughter of Lithuanians born in Brazil).\
  \ I felt a mixture of longing and happiness. It was just the beginning of many surprises\
  \ and sensations that I would feel in the future.\nDuring the weekend that I spent\
  \ walking through the streets of Vilnius, I lived and saw many things:\nIn the old\
  \ town square, I visited the Cathedral of Vilnius, the heart of the spiritual life\
  \ of Lithuania. Founded in the 18th century, it is considered a UNESCO World Heritage\
  \ Site. I felt like I was renewing my energies.\nIn the Gediminas tower, important\
  \ historical symbol of the country, I knew the memories and conquests of Lithuania.\
  \ In addition to rescuing more than 600 years of history, I had a beautiful view\
  \ of the city and the sunset.\nIn Santa Ana\u2019s Church, founded in 1500, I was\
  \ surprised by such beauty. According to a local tale, the emperor Napoleon found\
  \ the church so beautiful that he wanted to take it with him to Paris \"in the palm\
  \ of his hand\".\nAt the University of Vilnius, founded in the 16th century, I met\
  \ one of the oldest institutions of education in Eastern Europe and the largest\
  \ university in Lithuania. I imagined how I would feel if I was one of its more\
  \ than 20.000 students.\nIn the \"Republic of Uzupis\", the statue of an angel received\
  \ me. Symbolically proclaimed independent by a group of artists, there are many\
  \ sculptures and hidden paintings in the region. In Uzupis I came across the local\
  \ constitution, which taught me, among other things, that \"everyone has the right\
  \ to be happy and that everyone can share what they have.\"\nAt the Vilnia river,\
  \ which gave rise to the name of the city, I felt peace and tranquility. Surrounded\
  \ by trees, the river runs through all the Lithuanian capital.\nIn the Central Market,\
  \ through the fresh products of the region, I met new smells, colors and flavors.\n\
  In the eyes of some old ladies, I could see my grandmother's eyes. Trying a portion\
  \ of \u201Cblynai\u201D (potato pancake) and a bowl of \u201C\u0161altibar\u0161\
  \u010Diai\u201D (cold beet soup) \u2013 I could taste her food.\nEven without knowing\
  \ the city and the language, I seemed to know exactly where I was going. Every street\
  \ and every corner seemed to be linked to a memory that was not mine but that was\
  \ alive inside me.\nOn this trip I learned a lot, not only about Lithuania, but\
  \ about myself. I found a missing piece of a puzzle, which helped me to build my\
  \ personality. At last, I felt like my great grandfathers were back in Lithuania,\
  \ but through my eyes and my feet."
