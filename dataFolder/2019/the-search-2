Text: "I join the trip because I\u2019m trying to trace the path my great-grandmother\
  \ passed on her way to Lagos in 1931. I don\u2019t tell anyone this because they\u2019\
  ll laugh it off, say I\u2019m faux deep. But, it\u2019s not because of a man, I\
  \ convince myself. \n\n*\nIt\u2019s a two-hour journey by road between Lagos and\
  \ Ibadan, the city of my ancestors. At the park, men call out different cities through\
  \ megaphones\u2014\u201CKwara\u201D, \u201CIbadan\u201D, \u201CEkiti\u201D. There\
  \ are small white buses crammed with people and luggage, including raffia baskets\
  \ of tomatoes, but we pick a private car. The driver we\u2019ve picked drives a\
  \ grey Camry that\u2019s been bashed in several places. He smiles, showing off shiny\
  \ brown teeth with red pepper stains. He tells us we can pay three thousand, \u201C\
  just three thousand\u201D if we want the air conditioner on. His thin long nose,\
  \ cream skin and mascara dark eyes make me think he\u2019s from the North, possibly\
  \ Fulani. But from his thick accent, I guess he\u2019s from the East, and it\u2019\
  ll be harder to bargain with him. My girlfriend switches from English to Igbo, but\
  \ he shakes his head at the prices she calls. He finally agrees to take us for 2000\
  \ naira, without Air conditioning. We shrug, it\u2019s cheaper than we budgeted.\
  \ \n\n*\n\nMotion makes me sleepy. I lean my into the window and shut my eyes. It\u2019\
  s not very hot. The opposite window is open and breeze cools my face. I open my\
  \ eyes when we get to our first stop at a gas station. We buy egg rolls, a bottle\
  \ of groundnuts and zobo from traders who bombard our window with trays. I stay\
  \ up the rest of the trip because the dents in the road make it uncomfortable to\
  \ stay in one position for long. In my travel notepad from Korea I stare at minuscule\
  \ facts I know about my great grandmother\u2014that she was from Port Novo, but\
  \ married a Yoruba prince in Ibadan and left to Lagos in 1931 after he died. I stare\
  \ at trees and wonder if the roads and forest had been nothing but barren land when\
  \ my great-grandmother passed by them. \n\nThere\u2019s no musty old smell like\
  \ in Lagos when we get to Ibadan. Ibadan smells soft\u2014of milk and soil, unlike\
  \ Lagos. When the driver drops us at our stop, Challenge bus stop, an intersection\
  \ in the middle of the road, bike men with different kinds of tribal marks call\
  \ out to us, \u201Cfine girl\u201D, \u201Csisi\u201D and we answer. Our host, Ruth,\
  \ an old friend had given us directions on how to find her place. On the bike, I\
  \ study Ibadan\u2019s landscape\u2014the sloppy roads covered in red earth, the\
  \ buildings, their brown corrugated roofing sheets coated in dust. I think about\
  \ how my great grandmother\u2019s feet must have been coated in soot if she\u2019\
  d had to walk from the village before getting a vehicle to Lagos. \n\n*\n\nIt gets\
  \ dark quickly. We only have two nights so we don\u2019t plan to do much sightseeing.\
  \ The last time I was in Ibadan, I had come to see a lover. During the trip, I didn\u2019\
  t remember that the city was home to my family as my lover and I  made out or stared\
  \ at bored lions in the zoo. A little part of me wants to see him at brunch tomorrow;\
  \ Ruth invited him and I had no objections. I wanted to stare into his eyes, to\
  \ guilt trip him for abandoning me for another woman. I don\u2019t think he\u2019\
  ll come.\n\nThere\u2019s a famous restaurant that sells Amala and Abula, Ibadan\u2019\
  s staple meal. It had been my great-grandmother's favorite meal, my grandfather\
  \ told me. It\u2019s our first stop. Our faces drip with sweat as we roll Amala\
  \ into balls and lick pepper off our fingers. \n\nLater, as Ruth drives us around\
  \ in an old Volvo that threatens to fall apart, I stick my head out the window,\
  \ dancing . It's an attempt take as much of Ibadan as I can in me or to pour as\
  \ much of me on the dimly streets.\n\nThe next day, when he doesn\u2019t show up\
  \ during brunch, I tear the page with my great-grandmother\u2019s details and throw\
  \ it into the trash can."
