Text: "A Los Angeles native that finds solace in public transportation, a rare find\
  \ indeed, therefore when abroad I begin my explorations with the buses and railways.\
  \ The seven islands that supports Mumbai\u2019s population of 22 million are all\
  \ stitched together with the infamous \u2018Mumbai Local Train.\u2019 A train laid\
  \ out by the British Colonizer, that seemed not to have been updated since India\u2019\
  s Independence in 1947. I step onto the train platform, and the neglected railway\
  \ line had poor loud speakers, confusing information boards, and trash. My hour\
  \ and a half commute quickly forced me to ignore all the inconveniences because\
  \ currently there is what I believe to be half of the city\u2019s public that all\
  \ needed to get to work ten minutes ago.  \n\nMy limbs are folded, and I stand with\
  \ my head peeping above a crowd of men anticipating the next train. Like a school\
  \ of fish refusing to work in unison, we all board. A few curse words are tossed\
  \ around, hands end up in each other\u2019s faces, but we manage to land our feet\
  \ after kicking someone in the shin. My long curls spread out on the surrounding\
  \ men\u2019s faces and my kurta\u2019s elegant draping was compromised. The crowd\
  \ stares at me as I adjust. The room, or train car, reads, \u2018please put away\
  \ all of your femininity, it might touch me.\u2019\n\nThere is no more time or space\
  \ to romanticize on the train, to listen to a melodramatic song while looking out\
  \ the window and float over landscapes, or quietly read the novel that sits in your\
  \ bag every day. The key to Mumbai Local is survival of the fastest. The morning\
  \ train was delayed and led to my discovery of the \u2018Ladies Car.\u2019 I learn\
  \ that the line of train cars includes the \u2018General\u2019, \u2018Handicap/Elderly\u2019\
  , \u2018Luggage\u2019, \u2018First Class\u2019 and \u2018Ladies\u2019 Cars. I let\
  \ out a sigh of relief as I\u2019m among my own kind. \n\nI reach out to pull myself\
  \ up inside the train car, only to find that the train had left without me. Every\
  \ woman managed to stick an arm, head, leg, or even a child out in front of me and\
  \ thrusted inside, leaving me stranded and already exasperated. The next train arrives\
  \ in 7 minutes. I hold my purse close and take my dangling earrings off because\
  \ nothing should slow me down. The train whistles and the platform horde braces\
  \ itself. \n\nI have the burned memory of a 70-year-old lady looking me in the eye\
  \ and calling me \u201CChutiya\u201D (Fucker) because I was moving to slow for her.\
  \ The curse words were dirtier, my hair was grabbed at by someone\u2019s armpit,\
  \ bags were shoved into our faces, and my toes curled up to keep my left sandal\
  \ from falling. After having every women\u2019s sweat rubbed all over each other,\
  \ the morning shower was for naught. \n\nI repeat the experience to a couple of\
  \ local guy friends that don\u2019t believe in the almost innate aggression and\
  \ endurance these commuting women have. They\u2019re \u2018ladies\u2019 who are\
  \ separated from the \u2018General\u2019 car, I now found to be wrongfully labeled,\
  \ because femininity is something precious that shouldn\u2019t withstand in the\
  \ general crowd. In other words, men and women cannot exist in the same space because\
  \ it can only result in no accountability for their actions and only heterosexual\
  \ chaos. These young men found no irony in their words. Our gender is an added difficulty\
  \ to living and the fallacies surrounding femininity led to the \u2018Ladies\u2019\
  \ versus \u2018General\u2019 car. The public\u2019s solution was to handicap us.\n\
  \nThe Mumbai Local became second nature. All I had to remember was to wear my hair\
  \ in a braid, tighten my sandals, take off my earrings, and not be too confident\
  \ about putting on makeup. The women of Bombay didn\u2019t care for any feminine\
  \ roles when heading to work. We had been given two train cars out of twelve, and\
  \ parallel to our male counterparts also survived in the \u2018Maximum City\u2019\
  . I recall the phrase \u2018lady-like\u2019 as I board into my train car every day."
