Text: "I recently spent a week crash-test exams, the worst period of this Erasmus\
  \ experience just started, to the point that I could no longer stay here in the\
  \ university residence. Friday night, an hour before going to a veterinary party,\
  \ I turn on the computer and look at the courier and accommodation prices, more\
  \ out of curiosity than for real interest; then, without even realizing, I find\
  \ myself booking a trip to Marseilles and even a dormitory, the cheapest of all\
  \ the proposals, without reading comments and with full irresponsibility.\nI come\
  \ back in my room around 4:00 am on Saturday morning, the time to take a shower\
  \ and to climb under the covers. Wake up at 7:30 am, then bus and metro; I stop\
  \ at a supermarket to take a dark chocolate bar before arriving at the station.\
  \ At the last minute I can take the bus of 10:00 am for Marseille, the moment in\
  \ which he\u2019s leaving. On the bus I meet other Italian Erasmus people: Serena,\
  \ Chiara and Ilaria; they had lost the previous bus and coincidentally they took\
  \ mine. Finally I can speak Italian after a long time, four months of only French.\
  \ They decide to join me, a group of Italians wandering about a new city; I accompany\
  \ them in the stages I had planned on the bus: Arc de Triomphe, Quartier du Pain,\
  \ the old port, the ferris wheel and Miroir Ombri\xE8re. We share our life and far\
  \ from all my imagination, the loneliness of departure has lasted very little.\n\
  At 5:30 pm we leave each other; they must go to the station to return to Lyon and\
  \ I go back to wander alone. I head to the dorm that is located in a bad neighborhood\
  \ of the city; I reach it and the structure is disappointing, worse than I expected:\
  \ floor tiles that there are here and there aren\u2019t there, cracks on the walls,\
  \ dirt on the ground and a defeated armchair would be the appearance of a waiting\
  \ room. I share the dorm room with a giant Brazilian named Brendo and a Ghanaian\
  \ professor of geography and traveling lover named Ruddy. We spend the night together,\
  \ they tell me about their life, I offer them a piece of dark chocolate, the Brazilian\
  \ offers me his orange juice and the Ghanaian his beer.\nIn the morning I wake up\
  \ early to take a ferry to the island of If where there is a famous castle-prison.\
  \ In the queue at the ticket office I meet a clumsy Italian in the French language\
  \ and I help him; on the ferry he and his group of 8 people come to look for me\
  \ and they present themselves, all between the fifty and sixty, all Italians and\
  \ together in a cruise in Mediterranean Sea. We eat together, I\u2019ve already\
  \ a jar with carrots and peas, but they offer me one of their sandwiches and a coffee\
  \ in a bar despite my waste. I feel indebted so I share with them the remaining\
  \ part of the chocolate, but two pieces still remain. We come back to the old port\
  \ by ferry and we left at the fish market around 3:00 pm, between hugs and kisses.\n\
  After I took the bus back, this time without the risk of losing it. I sit down next\
  \ to a man, looking calm, thin and with marked cheekbones typical of Northern Europe.\
  \ I read a book as long as I can, then the lights of the bus are lowered in intensity\
  \ and, unable to read, I find myself talking to the man by my side. He is a Polish;\
  \ speaking of this and that, I discover that he makes filming, he is a photographer\
  \ and now he finds himself with a French contract that guarantees him a salary certainly\
  \ better than the Polish; the girlfriend stayed in Poland together with the Weimaraner,\
  \ to whom it is already the fifth time that she gives oxygenated water to make it\
  \ vomit because it loves to eat socks. I share with him the last two squares of\
  \ dark chocolate; we leave when the bus finishes its run, asking before going down\
  \ its name: Lukas or something similar.\nAt the university entry I don\u2019t find\
  \ myself alone: another man is with me. I find out that he is a Belgian named Carmelo,\
  \ a vet of equine at the University, \u2018former\u2019 Erasmus in Sicily, whose\
  \ experience had a particular meaning because in reality it is son of Italian immigrants\
  \ in Brussels; He congratulates me on my future. All this talking Italian.\nReturn\
  \ to my room; the cold has frozen my extremities, but the shivers that I still feel\
  \ have a completely different nature. I lived, I think, the best adventure of my\
  \ 22 years. I had left with the fear of going to the unknown, starting blindly,\
  \ finding people completely different from me. However all these people gave me\
  \ something, they were curious as I was with them; from perfect strangers we exchanged\
  \ hugs and confided our lives."
