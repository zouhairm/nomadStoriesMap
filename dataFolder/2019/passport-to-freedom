Text: "I left Ohio with $800 in my bank account. I packed up my red Pontiac Grand\
  \ Am with everything I could manage to fit in it! As I drove through Ohio I passed\
  \ fields of greenery, beautiful green fields that stretched for miles and miles.\
  \ I eventually made it to Pennsylvania and was well on my way to the \"Big Apple\"\
  . I had no idea where I was going to sleep once I got there and I vaguely knew what\
  \ I wanted to do with my life at that point but I just knew I would go crazy if\
  \ I stayed in Ohio.\n\nMore than 8 hours had passed and I was almost in New York.\
  \ My specific destination was Long Island, I read about it before going. I had to\
  \ see the city though before I went into Long Island. Upon arriving in the City,\
  \ I was met with trash, a lot of trash. The city was dark and gloomy, winter was\
  \ coming. I had never seen so many people all in one place before, I had never heard\
  \ so much loud noise and commotion. A part of me was overwhelmed by it all and the\
  \ other part of my was excited! \n\nThe traffic was heavy, I turned to the local\
  \ radio stations as I made my way to Long Island. The music was different, nothing\
  \ like the Country sounds I heard in Ohio. The beats were heavy and foreign to my\
  \ ears, they called it house music. \n\nI arrived in Long Island eventually, I immediately\
  \ went to the local library to see what the money I had left after gas and food\
  \ could get me. I found a room with a nice woman. From here, I started to look for\
  \ work and I wanted to meet new people. In Long Island, there were a lot of Italian\
  \ families, a lot of handsome Italian men. Growing up, I loved the film \"A Bronx\
  \ Tale\". In the film a young Italian man falls in love with a young Black woman.\
  \ I thought, \"maybe I would have my own version of \"A Bronx Tale\" but Long Island\
  \ style?\"\n\nI stayed in Long Island for over a year. I'll be honest, it was rough!\
  \ Jay Z said it best about New York, \"City is a pity, half of yall won't make it\"\
  .  I moved more times than I can remember, I found myself in A LOT of questionable\
  \ situations, I was spending more money than I had and I didn't get my own version\
  \ of \"A Bronx Tale\" like I had imagined. Yeah, it was rough but New York made\
  \ me even tougher than I already was. There were things I loved about that place,\
  \ there were things I hated about it too. I finally left New York after coming to\
  \ my senses one night at a \"boyfriends\" house. I had just left the place I was\
  \ staying because a roommate and I had one final blow. I was sitting at the man's\
  \ house I was dating and another \"friend\" of his was coming over. Before I went\
  \ to bed I told myself that I was leaving New York in my red Grand AM in the morning\
  \ and that I was off to California, who wants to live where it snows anyway?"
