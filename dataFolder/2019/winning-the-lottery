Text: "When we land in Marrakesh the night is dark and crisp. Standing on the pavement\
  \ beside the bizarre white zigzag of the airport, a flock of taxi drivers swoop\
  \ on us, haggling for our fare. The wheels crunch over the wet road while I adjust\
  \ to the surreal sight of Marrakesh at night. The Qua\u2019ran in disc form dangles\
  \ from the rear view mirror, as Arabic pop croons on the radio. Thick shiny leaves\
  \ billow out from behind walls. The air smells like jasmine, dust and rain. As we\
  \ approach the cramped, medieval centre the road begins to narrow. Our taxi crawls\
  \ through cobbled streets, and I glimpse scenes of domestic life through the dim\
  \ windows of sandy coloured buildings; men playing card games and pouring tea into\
  \ short glasses.\n\nAs we came to know Marrakesh over the following week, the quietness\
  \ of night became a sort of sanctuary from the bustle of the day. We overheard Moroccan\
  \ women speaking quietly behind the high walls of the riads that surrounded our\
  \ hotel; we heard guests welcomed nearby with a rustling of locks and warm voices.\
  \ Gazing out over the rooftops, we welcomed the quiet rituals of the evening. Men\
  \ on the neighbouring rooftops shake rugs out onto the streets, while we listen\
  \ to the call to prayer; mournful in the pink evening. In the distance, the huge\
  \ Koutoubia mosque towers high into the skyline.\n\nOur days dazzle with the beauty\
  \ of the medieval towers and mosques, the exotic bazaars and quaint roadside dentists.\
  \ In the souks, we bargain for turquoise bracelets and glass tea sets. I almost\
  \ find myself giggling along when good humoured guides offer camels in exchange\
  \ for me or banter about lazy Moroccan men sleeping while their wives work in the\
  \ fields. Carpet salesmen humour us with sweet mint tea, and regale us with stories\
  \ of the various rugs on offer. A speciality is a white rug with a stark zigzag\
  \ pattern, which the salesman emphasises takes a woman years to weave. Women are\
  \ referred to often throughout our trip, but I hardly ever encounter or speak to\
  \ one. In a shop specialising in Argan oil, an over-zealous salesman forces us onto\
  \ the ground to pose for an obligatory selfie with a small woman, crouched over\
  \ a pestle and mortar who is busy crushing seeds to make oil. Down a tiny alleyway,\
  \ beside an old-style pharmacy, a huge man hisses the words 'American woman' at\
  \ me. I feel something unfamiliar: fear.\n\nWe travel further south to Taroudent.\
  \ After an intense experience on public transport, we arrive at our hotel. It is\
  \ a huge pink castle, with oriental rugs and lizards climbing on the banana trees\
  \ in the outdoor bar. When I sit by the empty pool smoking, men stare . The incongruous\
  \ looking Christmas tree reminds me of what time of year it is back home. On Boxing\
  \ Day we take a hiking trip through our tour guide's home village, which is located\
  \ up a mountain. Walking through the dusty streets, groups of children run alongside\
  \ us , pointing and laughing at my hair. We stop for food near field, where crops\
  \ are being harvested. A smiling woman passes us doubled over, carrying on her back\
  \ a huge sheaf of the crop. We see goats climbing trees to eat nuts, and the ancient\
  \ ruin of a mosque that sits quietly on a rocky hillside. On the way back down to\
  \ our hotel, the guide brings us in to a local's hut. The hut is  a mud block structure\
  \ with no electricity, and has leaves scattered on the ground in lieu of a carpet\
  \ or floorboards. In one of the dark rooms two haggard women sit on a mat on the\
  \ floor, toothlessly demanding money from our tour guide. Looking at their faces,\
  \ I feel how terribly vulnerable they are. I stare uselessly at them, I have no\
  \ change to give.\n\nBack at the hotel, the sun is setting over Taroudant.  Sitting\
  \ on the ramparts of the pink castle, I look out over the huts in the distance.\
  \ I think about the lottery of our births, and how very lucky I have been."
