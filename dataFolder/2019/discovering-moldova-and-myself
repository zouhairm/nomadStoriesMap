Text: "\u201CMoldovans like to party\u201D my boyfriend said, \u201CHope you like\
  \ Cognac\u201D. But I don\u2019t. As any Italian, I prefer Spritz and wine, but\
  \ the day after I had no choice. \nI was invited at the bachelorette party of the\
  \ girl my boyfriend was promised to. Even if, at the beginning this news was making\
  \ me feel a bit uncomfortable, after few hours I was feeling welcomed, and during\
  \ all the night there was always someone translating the conversations for me, to\
  \ make me understand.\nAt the end of the party, the guys came to pick us up with\
  \ a Limo, and we just drove round and round the centre of Chisinau until five in\
  \ the morning. \n \nIn the following days, I had the pleasure to visit the centre\
  \ of Chisinau from a different point of view. \nIt was marked by the typical soviet\
  \ style of the buildings, but at the same time the austerity of its big palaces\
  \ was mitigated by the presence of rose gardens, flowerbed, and the magnificent\
  \ colours of orthodox churches decorations. \nOne night later, the wedding celebrations\
  \ flourished in a fairy decorated garden. And as the Moldovan style requests, during\
  \ the night: fireworks, rivers of cognac, singers and dancers, and endless traditional\
  \ dances, followed until the early morning.\n  \nI left the shiny and loud wedding\
  \ celebrations, to visit the dark and calm Moldovan countryside.\nIn the region\
  \ of Orhei, I found the deepest Moldovan reality. \nThere was only one small village\
  \ in the middle of the Orhei Valley, where only few people had electricity and in\
  \ a limited quantity. Those were the few ones that own a commercial activity in\
  \ the village, as the two taverns I\u2019ve met on my way. \nMe and my boyfriend\
  \ ate in one of those two and we were the only guests that night. The two old women\
  \ told us that I was the first foreign guest since long time.\n \n \nGetting inside\
  \ I realized that the women transformed their home garden, in a space where to host\
  \ and to serve their own food to the visitors of the valley. \nThis means that there\
  \ was no menu. They served what they had prepared that day, what was available,\
  \ what the nature provided them in that season.\nOnly the garden and the kitchen\
  \ were enlighten. Around us it was completely dark, and it was really humid. But\
  \ a sense of peace and serenity was flowing inside of me as the warm vegetable soup\
  \ that those women prepared for us in their own house kitchen. \n \nThe village\
  \ was surrounded by huge mountains and the peculiarity was that there were hidden\
  \ churches built in the rock of these mountains.\n\nThe sun was going down, when\
  \ we found at the end of the village, a path heading to a hill that was settled\
  \ really in the middle of the entire valley. \n \nWe took that path and we climb\
  \ up until the top of the hill.\nThe view was amazing\u2026 but what caught my attention\
  \ was the bell tower coming up from the ground, belonging to a church hidden in\
  \ the ground.\nExactly in the ground under my feet. \nDown there in the valley a\
  \ creek, and it was the only thing that was making a noise. \nWords were unnecessary,\
  \ nature was speaking out loud through its silence. \nMoldova gave me the loudest\
  \ and the quietest visit."
