Text: 'which village is this?I suddenly wake from my sleep

  ."DHASA" bus conductor answered., "so  why we are stayed here?" was still in sleep."bus
  need to be repair, we only can go ahead after fix this" conductor answered very
  calmly, of course this is his daily activity.

  I went to meet my grandmother and grandfather after long hours of corporate workload
  without of any weekends of months, hence now my body really demands rest, hence
  i thought village is the best option.

  And here at 3 am in midnight, bus break trust.further to go ahead it necessary to
  spend night in this village, to go out at granny home,in excitement i dint eat single
  piece of food and now my stomach also asking me for something, of course other person
  in the bus comes with them accompanied so they got their some arrangements to sleep
  on land for one night

  i was in worry, in unconscious situation seat on bunch of someone''s house where
  may be all them are slept in their home, and i just blame my self for taking such
  wrong decision to come to village.

  and suddenly, a light blink on my face, and in surprised one lady comes out of this
  house and asked me" Didi,are you okay?" I didn''t expect this question, i thought
  she must asked "why you seating here?"

  and I don''t know why, I tell her all thing happens during the time

  and she stood up and went back in her house, I was in worry to not expelled from
  house

  and again with surprised I saw her to come with plate of food which is freshly prepared,  i
  am eating in speed, I correct myself i.e meeting granny is very good decision

  Its seems like some angel seating beside me.

  eat with her I got to know that, her husband is died due to cancer few month ago
  and now her son caught in cancer


  I really got surprised in this night
