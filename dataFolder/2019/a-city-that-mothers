Text: "The year I turned 23 was the year I learnt about loss: I lost a grandmother\
  \ [to death]. I lost a childhood friend [to differences]. I lost my faith [due to\
  \ circumstance]. I lost out on a chance to love [and be loved]. And that was because\
  \ I had also lost myself.\nImagine my surprise upon the realization that the year\
  \ I turned 23, was by far the best year I had ever experienced. I travelled more\
  \ than I had in years, and it was through getting lost in those cities that I was\
  \ able to find myself again \u2013 and that\u2019s only the half of it. \n\nI assure\
  \ you, this is not another \u2018Eat, Pray, Love\u2019 account. I mean, sure. There\
  \ was a lot of eating. A moment or two of prayer. And a ton of love to go around.\
  \ But my account entails dancing, wandering, and more dancing\u2026 \n\nI\u2019\
  ve rambled enough. Let\u2019s head to Cape Town the same way I did in October 2018.\
  \ Bare in mind that I\u2019m a young woman who has never left the country of her\
  \ birth, having travelled out of my home city \u2013 Johannesburg \u2013 just over\
  \ a handful of times. This was my second time  setting foot in the Western Cape,\
  \ after a 10-year hiatus. Funny how simple it is to grasp the concept of embracing\
  \ the unknown, when immersed in a beautiful city, thousands of miles from home.\
  \ \n\nI was on my way to a music festival called Rocking the Daisies, accompanied\
  \ by a friend I had connected with during my first year of varsity, who left thereafter\
  \ to continue her studies in Cape Town. Our friendship survived the long distance.\
  \ We communicated constantly, and she had done her fair share of visiting every\
  \ now and then. I figured this time was my turn. Our excitement was through the\
  \ roof as we were both travelling outside of the care of parents and institutions.\
  \ \n\nAfter taking me on a brief tour of her enchanting world, we prepared for hour-long\
  \ road trip to the wine farm where the festival was taking place. Darling, it was\
  \ called. Why Darling? You get a clear sense of why, when driving past carpets of\
  \ endearing landscapes. I fell in love instantly. \n\nDespite the turmoil of setting\
  \ up tents [nothing exposed us more as rookies] and bearing with unbearable heat,\
  \ the setting was damn near perfect. Freedom was the order of the day. Every person\
  \ I encountered, exuded positive energy. Without a care in the world, I danced to\
  \ my heart\u2019s content - to songs even Shazam knew nothing about. It was the\
  \ therapeutic release I needed from the issues I\u2019d been avoiding\u2026\n\n\
  Within this beautiful chaos, I never expected to find clarity. My fears were realized,\
  \ but I was finally ready to face them. For about 60 hours, I was in a space that\
  \ allowed me to be myself unapologetically, and that\u2019s when it occurred to\
  \ me that that\u2019s all I wanted to be for the rest of my life. I had finally\
  \ found myself. And my passion[s] were reignited. I was more ready than ever to\
  \ live fervently in my purpose.\n\nThe amount of introspection that followed was\
  \ immeasurable. I reached an entirely new level of honesty with myself: I was not\
  \ ready for a relationship with someone else because I needed to form one with myself\
  \ first. I was not in the space to complete another degree as I was burning out.\
  \ I was not about to allow perfectionism to keep my talents chained a minute longer.\
  \ And all it took was weekend away from the city I was born and bred in, to bring\
  \ this change in perspective. \n\nCape Town provided the answers to my innermost\
  \ questions. Is this why she\u2019s called the Mother City?"
