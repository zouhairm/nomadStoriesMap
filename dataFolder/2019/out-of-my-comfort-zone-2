Text: "\"Travelling solo does not always mean you're alone, you meet marvellous people\
  \ along the way and create memories that last a lifetime\"- Anonymous. \n\nIt's\
  \ been almost 5-6 years since I've made it a point to travel to a new destination\
  \ for my birthday. I\u2019ve travelled to places like Bali, Andaman, Hong Kong,\
  \  etc., with either family or friends. I\u2019ve learned that I actually really\
  \ like my own company, and have allowed my travels to be what they are, to take\
  \ the colour of \u2018me\u2019 whatever that turned out to be. This is my journey,\
  \ and provides the opportunity to discover another layer of my own authentic expression.\
  \ \n\nFor my 30th birthday, in 2018, I decided to go on a solo trip to Thailand.\
  \ The reason I chose Thailand over other countries was the fact that it was closer\
  \ to India, cheaper than other South East Asian countries, convenience of Visa on\
  \ Arrival and better connectivity from major Indian cities, not to forget its pristine\
  \ beaches. I would always choose a beach destination over mountains. My itinerary\
  \ was a quick getaway to explore two towns in five days. \n\nThere\u2019s a saying\
  \ that you can take an Indian out of India but you just can\u2019t take India out\
  \ of an Indian and it fits to the T when it comes to my parents, having lived in\
  \ India all along. So, I decided to hide the fact that it was a solo trip. With\
  \ my bags packed and mentally prepared for the long via city travel, I finally reached\
  \ my first pit stop, Phuket. I managed to reach Phuket in the afternoon of the 13th\
  \ of August after almost a 9 hours\u2019 journey (would have reached a European\
  \ country in the same travel hour). Since I was well aware of the long journey,\
  \ I had already prepared myself by booking a suite with a pool and a Jacuzzi for\
  \ the next two nights. The day went by in unwinding in my hotel room by the pool\
  \ with local beers, great music and local food. I decided to explore the town by\
  \ hiring a scooter like most tourists do. The next D-Day, was spent in exploring\
  \ the temples like the Great Buddha and Buddhist temples and its beaches, and the\
  \ evenings were spent in exploring the local road side eateries in the dark but\
  \ colourful neighbourhoods. \n\nOn the 15th, after a short ferry ride journey of\
  \ around 2 hours, I reached the beautiful but quite crowded, town of Krabi. After\
  \ reaching Krabi, I did not waste time and straight away booked a scooter accompanied\
  \ by a local to see the emerald pool and the hot springs. The decision to take a\
  \ local along proved right in getting a taste of the the village life. Although\
  \ both the places on the very same day was a bit of a task, yet left no stone unturned\
  \ in exploring these two places to the fullest. A couple friend of mine had visited\
  \ Krabi for their honeymoon and they definitely did not have it as a must see in\
  \ their itinerary. The water baby I am, I thoroughly enjoyed myself. The next day,\
  \ 16th, was saved for the most popular must do in Krabi, a visit to the Phi Phi\
  \ Islands. So, the tour operator in my hotel had given me options to explore the\
  \ James Bond island and a tiny island or lots of tiny islands excluding James Bond.\
  \ I chose the latter since I was already disappointed to know that Maya Bay was\
  \ shut for tourists. Snorkelling and floating in the sea were the main highlights\
  \ in the tour. Tired and tanned, the evening was well spent with an early dinner,\
  \ a few drinks at a pub next to my hotel. \n\n17th was the last leg of my journey,\
  \ a ferry ride back to Phuket, in time to catch my flight back to India, a long\
  \ journey of around 10 hours.\n\nTraveling for the first time as a female solo traveller\
  \ is a growth experience on many levels, and I am so grateful for the opportunity\
  \ to do this \u201Cadventure of a lifetime.\u201D I\u2019m so glad I said \u201C\
  Yes\u201D to the calling of my heart."
