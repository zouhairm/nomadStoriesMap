Text: "The travel destination wasn't ment to the people who join me in the experience\
  \ I guess. Anyway, I went with my sister and one friend of the current job I had\
  \ at that time. I was working in a bank full time, and that was good enough to save\
  \ the money I needed to travel, which is the only thing I work for, and also o course,\
  \ to survive. Right? \n\nAt that time I felt obsessed with ancient Greek mitology,\
  \  so I ve decided to save for months to finally be there. For real. \nI really\
  \ felt like something was need to be discovered like a sort of revelation,  self\
  \ revelation and I wasn't nervous at all. \nMy sister (mayra)  and my friend (ariel)\
  \ were also curious about my full commitment about ancient history and Greek mitology,\
  \  also about being at the beach in mykonos and see the amazing sunset in santorini\
  \ \nWhen I got there, for real, I felt depressed.  But kind of a good self revelation,\
  \ and it had motivated myself to do an ancestry DNA and finally discovered that\
  \ I have 25% of Greek roots confirming that like I said, I needed to be there.\n\
  Why I felt sad about the trip i was looking for an saving for a long time? \nWell,\
  \ it's so much mysterious and dark that I thought. \nAthens is one of the most amazing\
  \ cities in the world, you can feel the power and the war and the blood spread for\
  \ over thousands of years. \nThe people are also like very sweet, and warm, and\
  \ funny (like, who doesn't like to break plats for free?!) But In some way i thought\
  \ also that they were kind of sad too \nI guess I really was going through a period\
  \ of my life very happily and then went there and boom! \nDays pass and things got\
  \ a little happier with the food, and the wine (its good not the best) and the beaches\
  \ are Amazing! \nI also got to meet one of my best friends , he is from India but\
  \ currently living in Amsterdam and we have been friends since that trip for almost\
  \ 4 years now \nWhen I got back to Argentina (it's where I am from) sooner i quit\
  \ my job and start the journey of getting to know myself.. I'm still in that, of\
  \ course. \nBut I always will remember the impression about Athens, like, I really\
  \ need to know more about myself, why am I feeling so sad? I guess we all have some\
  \ sort of destiny where we felt like kind of a home where u start asking yourself,\
  \  what am I doing with my life? What's my propuse in this planet called earth?\
  \ \n\nSo thank you Athens, I ll remember you like dark is just the ausence of light,\
  \ it really doesn't define for herself \n\nWritten by \n\nDana Fraga"
