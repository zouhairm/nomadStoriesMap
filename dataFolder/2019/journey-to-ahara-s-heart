Text: "This is a story that takes place in a Mexican magic city. In fact, the oldest\
  \ populated city in America. This is an ongoing true story.\n\nI found her on Tinder\
  \ and gave her a Super Like.\n\nI loved her face, her delicate body, her black hair\
  \ and dark wheat colored skin, her small frank teeth framed by her beautiful lips...\
  \ She has this uncommon features that make her look like a happy Eskimo goddess.\
  \ I called her \u201Cmi Esquimala\u201D. \n\nI miss her.\n\nFour days we chat on\
  \ the app, then I send her my number and asked her out on a Wednesday, maybe we\
  \ could go somewhere on Friday? But she didn\u2019t send a message and I didn\u2019\
  t dare to ask why. We kept the chat on. \n\nFour days later, in the morning, she\
  \ finally send me a whatsapp message. We agreed to see each other that same day\
  \ at the Great Pyramid of Cholula, the largest pyramid in the world. More precisely,\
  \ at the Sanctuary of the Virgin of Los Remedios, the church the Spanish built over\
  \ the pyramid like a great monument to history\u2019s Ouroboroses nature.\n\nI was\
  \ nervous, and happy to see the city from the perspective of that man made mountain\
  \ again, the \u201CTlachihualtepetl\u201D. Long time I didn\u2019t care to go up\
  \ to see Popocat\xE9petl and Iztacc\xEDhuatl\u2026 But there I was, saluting them\
  \ again with my heart pounding anxious to see her.\n\nWe sat in a bench at the back\
  \ side of the church. We talked for hours, we laughed, we saw each other curiously.\
  \ I could see my street from there, and further was the city of Puebla with its\
  \ new buildings and \u201CLa Malinche\u201D mountain. It was cloudy and windy and\
  \ about time to go to the market for some \u201Cquesadillas\u201D or \u201Cmolotes\u201D\
  \ or \u201Ccemitas\u201D. We were hungry.\n\nI had seen that place many times but\
  \ this time I renewed my feelings for it\u2026 So beautiful its colorful fruit,\
  \ vegetables and flower stalls, and so mouth-watering the smell of so many different\
  \ food! We talked for hours, we laughed, we saw each other curiously. We finished\
  \ our quesadillas but it had started to rain. It didn\xB4t look like stopping soon\
  \ so we decide to go.\n\nShe asked me if I wanted to accompany her to an event in\
  \ \u201CToro\u201D a (not so) \u201Cnearby\u201D bar. I said yes, of course. The\
  \ rain didn\u2019t stop, it got worst. I asked her if she wanted to wait under a\
  \ small roof we found in the street. She said \u201CT\xFA qu\xE9 har\xEDas si vinieras\
  \ solo / What would you do if you\u2019d come alone\u201D. I said \u201CSeguir\xED\
  a caminando / I would keep walking\u201D. So we did.\n\nBy the time we got to the\
  \ bar, well\u2026 water wets, you know?! Her sweatshirt and her shoes were soaking\u2026\
  \ She looked beautiful, I didn\u2019t. I was kind of mad because I didn\u2019t want\
  \ things to go that way. My home was three streets away from the bar. So, yes\u2026\
  \ I said \u201CMi casa est\xE1 aqu\xED cerca, \xBFquieres que nos vayamos a cambiar\
  \ y regresamos? Te presto una camiseta y un su\xE9ter o algo\u2026 / My house is\
  \ three streets away, should we go change our clothes and come back? I can borrow\
  \ you a T-shirt and a sweater or something...\u201D.\n\nThere, in my room, in my\
  \ bed\u2026 she told me she had an open flight to Spain, that any day they could\
  \ call her and tell her she had to take the airplane. \n\nShe has both nationalities\
  \ and she had decided to study in Spain while she works in Portugal.\n\nAll I manage\
  \ to say was \u201C\xA1Te quiero! Se mi novia.\u201D\n\nTo my surprise her home\
  \ was 5 streets away from the pyramid. Mine was too, but from the other side. So\
  \ our love story took place in those 10 blocks. I saw her almost every day since\
  \ we first met. I met her family, I played with her nephew Luka, I talked lots of\
  \ interesting things with her mother and I delighted with the food and the chocolates\
  \ her sister cooked. \n\nI was happy.\n\nBut every deadline expires and every date\
  \ fulfills itself. That day was one week ago."
