Text: "When I was 19 years old, I was a student at a university in Kyoto, Japan. It\
  \ was my first time abroad. The dorms rented out to international students were\
  \ gender separated; I lived in the city\u2019s YWCA, a boarding house-style building\
  \ that I shared with two fellow students, and some thirty Japanese women. Everyone\
  \ kept to themselves, and many nights I wasn\u2019t even there. \n\nThe international\
  \ students had become quite close, citing social anxiety procured by Japan\u2019\
  s traditional, homogeneous culture as a reason. It was ignorant, arrogant even,\
  \ for us to buy into our stereotyped reservations, but we were often too busy engaging\
  \ each other to even notice that we\u2019d created our own exclusive bubble. It\
  \ was ironic; we isolated ourselves before the locals could reject us. We spent\
  \ almost all of our free time together, often in the boys\u2019 dormitory, the Kamogawa,\
  \ which shares the name of the river that runs through Kyoto\u2019s center. \n\n\
  On a particular night, a feast was at hand at the Kamogawa, of course with plenty\
  \ of sake. Before midnight, just one block away, a Buddhist temple began to ring\
  \ a giant bell in a slow, rhythmic pattern. It would ring 108 times in total, representing\
  \ the 108 human defilements responsible for suffering, and releasing us from them.\
  \ The tradition allowed us to start the new year freshly; newly. People went to\
  \ listen and pay their respects to the temple directly, so we did, too.\n\nFollowing\
  \ a toast of more sake smuggled in, our merrily intoxicated group separated into\
  \ various debaucheries of the night. There was talk of izakayas, karaoke, sleep,\
  \ and staying awake to watch the hatsuhinode (first sunrise). In the crowds flocking\
  \ the temple grounds, I was separated. Not knowing where my friends were going,\
  \ I went back to the YWCA alone to wait the several hours until sunrise. \n\nOne\
  \ thing that I really liked about my building was the flat roof. You could go up\
  \ the stairs to the top floor, where an often unlocked door led out onto the roof,\
  \ five floors high. It offered a spectacular view of the surrounding area, which\
  \ included the massive former Imperial Palace and its sprawling gardens. On this\
  \ early morning, I stood there, wrapped in the comforter from my futon bed, feeling\
  \ a bit lonely but mostly grateful to be in such a beautiful place. At one point,\
  \ the door behind me opened. \n\nOne of the women from the building, appearing in\
  \ her later 30\u2019s or into 40\u2019s, stepped out and our eyes met in mutual\
  \ surprise. A long moment passed, and she stepped back inside. The door closed with\
  \ a click, and I stared at it. \n\nI was a gaijin; an outsider. Negative stereotypes\
  \ aside, it was simple fact. I had found niceness and curiosity from many locals\
  \ while playing guest to their country, but it wasn\u2019t uncommon to encounter\
  \ those that avoided my gaze. I knew that anxiety; I understood. \n\nI was very\
  \ surprised when the door opened again. \n\nIt was the same woman, but this time\
  \ she stepped out onto the roof and began walking towards me. I noticed that she\
  \ was carrying something in her hands. It was two cups of tea. \n\nNo one had ever\
  \ made me tea before, besides my mom. I was stunned. \n\nShe asked me if I could\
  \ speak Japanese, and I bashfully admitted, \u201CChotto.\u201D I asked her if she\
  \ could speak English, and she mimicked me. \u201CA little.\u201D We smiled and\
  \ sipped the tea. She asked me if I was cold, and if the tea was warm enough. She\
  \ asked me if I liked Japan. All of these things, she asked slowly, so that I could\
  \ understand her. I stumbled over my responses, and she praised me. \n\nWe watched\
  \ the sunrise together. Once the colors had faded and everything was light, she\
  \ turned to me and bowed. \u201CAkemashita omedetou gozaimasu.\u201D The greeting,\
  \ given on New Year\u2019s Day, means congratulations on the new beginning. \n\n\
  I felt the bubble pop, unsupported. I felt my prejudices collapse as a local connection\
  \ formed. The simple but great power of an offering of tea; it opened my eyes to\
  \ the world beyond my na\xEFve view. \n\nA new beginning, indeed."
