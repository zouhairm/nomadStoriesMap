Text: "I asked my mom, who has 35 years of marriage, how many times has she fall in\
  \ love with the same person. The answer was \" the details\" that made her fall\
  \ in love over the years for my dad.\nI believe that when you have the opportunity\
  \ to meet a city like Paris that\xB4s what happens. Was my third time in the city\
  \ of love, and I was alone.\nAnd with a shy smile, I arrived on Haute Couture avenue,\
  \ Champs Elis\xE9. It was a cold November and the magic fashion windows for the\
  \ Christmas was everywhere. I walked until the Grand Palais o see an Irvin Penn\
  \ exhibition, my eyes were impressed by that art, the details for every light colour\
  \ and stylist made him one of the best fashion Fotografer of the century. So I decided\
  \ to appreciate the view on the top of Notre Dame, and after 5 minutes observing\
  \ that roses windows, Paris whispered in my ear \" La Vie en Rose\". My heart just\
  \ skips a bit. The next stop was  Museu Les Arts D\xE9coratifs to see 70 years of\
  \ fashion by Dior. That was my childhood dream coming true. The shapes, colours,\
  \ textures, sequins and some many details. I was in fashion heaven, for sure. I\
  \ decided to see the Eiffel Tower before dinner when I step at Trocadero that magnificent\
  \ tower lit glowing. I had an insight that moment. I remembered why was so good\
  \ to travel solo, to find your inner light, to discover yourselves. To fall in love\
  \ with Paris. \nSo I  enjoyed the best Parisian food at Cafe de Flore. French red\
  \ wine, local cheese and homemade bread for the delight of food lovers. \nAnd as\
  \ I was walking by the street, thinking hat all that could be better if was shared\
  \ with someone special, started to snow. And of course, I was dancing in the middle\
  \ of Paris, alone, laughing felling the cold snow in my face. It was one of the\
  \ happiest moment of that year. \nAfter one more glass of wine in my hostel Les\
  \ Piaules,  listening to an involving jazz band I slept like an angel.\n I'm sure\
  \ Paris thought of all detail how to make me fall in love with her, in every corner\
  \ detail, food and piece of fashion history. Was the proof that I choose the right\
  \ professional path and the right city to visit over and over again. When you fall\
  \ in love in Paris and for yourself a the same time so fashionlovers:  \"We will\
  \ always have Paris\"."
