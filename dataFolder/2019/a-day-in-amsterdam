Text: "woohooO!!! I'm  back and so ready to keep telling you about my adventures.\
  \ So let's talk about Amsterdam.\nSitting down with my aunt in London, looking at\
  \ the map and at tickets, I decided to go there about a day or two before I actually\
  \ did. So heads up guys!! everything about it was soooo last minute.\n\n I was in\
  \ town for one day only. A day full of joy.\nI got there very early in the morning\
  \ and took the train to \"Amsterdam Centraal\", on my way made a  friend (she was\
  \ a Brazilian student) and we decided to go for breakfast together. We found a little\
  \ cozy place not far from Amsterdam Centraal, it wasn't vegan, but tea, juice, and\
  \ a plate of fruit got me going.\nAt this point, I still had my carry on with me\
  \ and had no idea about anything bc it was also my first time visiting. Yes.\nThere\
  \ was a hotel by, I went to ask about staying there and it was fully booked. Luckily\
  \ I overheard about lockers at Amsterdam central, and your girl who was just across\
  \ the street had no plans, but definitely, wasting part of the morning looking for\
  \ a hotel wasn't it. Went there to ask, locked her stuff for about \u20AC15, and\
  \ off to explore. So fancy lmao. (It was very safe guys like you need your credit\
  \ card and a code to open it). Consider it if you are going on a short trip.\nI\
  \ wore an oversized t-shirt, short leggings, and snickers, which was great to comfortably\
  \ walk around the city all day. No make-up, only SPF20 sunscreen , and red lipstick.\n\
  On my bag: sunglasses, watch, beautifying oil, red lipstick, portable charger, passport,\
  \ \U0001F4B6 \U0001F4B3.\nI spend the day exploring nonstop, and while The Anne\
  \ Frank House and some museums are still on my next list, I made it to tulips and\
  \ art markets, independent shopping streets, canals, Museumplein, different parks,\
  \ Red Light District (the energy there was sooo creepy), The Arty Jordaan, blah\
  \ blah blah.\nI loved how locals bike everywhere.       My beautiful hair expressing\
  \ itself freely on this picture, right before I found the tastiest vegan place.\
  \ \U0001F60B \U0001F331\nHave I mentioned my cousin lives there?, so I got in touch\
  \ and gladly no meter how last minute it was him and his family managed it to meet\
  \ me around 4 pm (THANK YOU\u2764\uFE0F, sorry I could not stay ), they showed me\
  \ the rest of the city, we went for dinner and I headed to my next stop, France\
  \ \U0001F1EB\U0001F1F7 . Will tell you more on my next post.\nIf you have no rush\
  \ and are just down to adventure like I was, once you get to Amsterdam you can take\
  \ the train to \u201CAmsterdam Centraal\u201D, from there it\u2019s easy to get\
  \ to pretty much everywhere."
