Text: "The plane landed with usual thud. I woke up into an alien world. In this alien\
  \ world, there were no impurities.  There was crystal clear water and sacred white\
  \ sand. The trees stood tall, enveloped by light blue sky.  There were silky white\
  \ clouds, acting as wanderers. And there was a warm fuzzy feeling of being on honeymoon.\
  \ \nMy mind tried to make sense of this alien world. It felt beautiful as my husband\
  \ put his arm around me as we looked at a naughty sea turtle and colorful coral\
  \ fishes on our way to villa. \nYou live in a hut built on exotic green water in\
  \ this alien world. The room also opens to a wavy sea, whom sun beautifies every\
  \ dawn and dusk. My husband stole glances at me. I glowed in similar subtle brightness\
  \ of love.  \nThe emerald like water also houses dolphins. These dolphins do not\
  \ know rules of our world. They think it is fine to zoom in and zoom out of water\
  \ when we went on ship besides them. My heart was beating in similar grooves as\
  \ I and my husband looked in each other\u2019s eyes. I recognized the beauty of\
  \ nature in both dolphin and my heart. Both have been created by almighty with perfect\
  \ sense. \nThere was no chaos in this perfect world. There is as much space between\
  \ fingers as is required to be able to hold another\u2019s hand. A bunch of fish\
  \ with long sword-like nose wander systematically in gorgeous sea. It does not get\
  \ lost without the signposts. They do not fight with each other using their swords\
  \ claiming that their respective water-patch has been usurped.\nI gorged on most\
  \ delicious food in this wonderful location. My appetite seemed to have got a new\
  \ lease of life.  But, the appetite of this world is not limited to materialistic\
  \ motives or physical desires. It is meant for connect. Connecting to the nature,\
  \ connecting to inner self, and connecting to the soul of universe.\nA snorkeling\
  \ tour was also organized by resort. As we deep-dived into the water, we could see\
  \ fishes of all types. There was one with colorful stripe, a gray one with snout\
  \ nose and some fairly large blue fishes. Although, there seems to be no conflict\
  \ between them. Each was happy with being itself. Each was happy with others being\
  \ themselves. How much beauty can there be if we could embrace our differences in\
  \ similar way. Certain experiences leave a mark on you; this one was surely the\
  \ deepest yet surreal among them. As I tried to make sense out of my hectic celebratory\
  \ week, I realized so far it was this moment which made me feel closest to my spouse.\n\
  On our last day, we strolled on the beautiful beach of Maldives. Its cleanliness\
  \ synchronized with the sense of unadulterated care \u2013 feeling of being together\
  \ without any frills.\nIt has been some days since I have been on this resort. It\
  \ has been some days since I have known my spouse. Both did not seem alien anymore.\
  \ It felt great to be home!"
