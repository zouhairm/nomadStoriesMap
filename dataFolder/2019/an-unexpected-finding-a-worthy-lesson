Text: "They welcomed us with some expressions in vary. Some showed their exciting,\
  \ some were confusing, some were like in deep water, and others stared at nothing.\
  \ Those were firstly I impressed when I arrived here in a large building. I`d never\
  \ expected to see this scene. It was an orphanage of disabilities, located in a\
  \ small village in North Sumatra, northern part of Indonesia. \nIt was at 10 am\
  \ when the church bell rang. All the orphans walked towards the church and entered\
  \ it. I observed them to get to know what they were gonna do in the church. I thought\
  \ there would be a Sunday School service at that time. All kids had already entered\
  \ except a little girl on her wheelchair. I walked toward and got closer to her.\
  \ \u201CHello\u201D, I said. She smiled at and replied me \u201CHello Madam\u201D\
  . It was such a sweetest smile I saw since I had been here. She pushed her wheelchair\
  \ with difficulty. It touched my heart while seeing this. I moved behind her and\
  \ held her wheelchair handles, helped her entering the church. \n\u201CWhat`s your\
  \ name?\u201D I asked. Again, this sweet cute girl smiled. \u201CAngel\u201D she\
  \ replied. I thought we still had some time to talk. She told me about herself.\
  \ It was very heart touching. She talked to me many things but she never complaints\
  \ above all of her disadvantaged life. She never even asked God \u201Cwhy...?\u201D\
  \ Why God gave her such colour of life, she never! Yeah ... she's truly like an\
  \ angel. Her smiling face taught me that we should live our lives with thanks giving.\
  \ \nFrom this cute girl I`ve learned much about the meaning of life. I believe that\
  \ God works on her and others who are hurting and disadvantaged, the people who\
  \ live without the loving support of parents and disabilities. He watches over them\
  \ who are alone and vulnerable, draws close to all orphans and hurting children,\
  \ and supplies their needs. And I believe that the day is coming when all their\
  \ tears will be wiped away from their eyes forever.\nMy cute Angel will always feel\
  \ comfort in her trials. My little Angel and her friends will never feel alone anymore\
  \ for we are here for them. They are not abandoned, they are protected from those\
  \ who will take advantages of their vulnerabilities, their physical and emotional\
  \ hurt that so many bitter things had to face in their young lives will be surely\
  \ healed. \nAngel, my sweetest little girlfriend, I always remember how tight you\
  \ held my hand as if you didn't wanna let it last. My sweety, long to meet you there\
  \ again. Wish I'll be there for you for longer time and watch your little hands\
  \ make crafting. You're great dear!\nWell then, what have we learned from those\
  \ people? That we must be grateful for every moment, both the good and the bad even\
  \ in the worst of our condition. Learn from their moments to make ourselves stronger."
