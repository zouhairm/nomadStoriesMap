Text: "I was surrounded. \n\nThese slabs of concrete, growing higher and wider as\
  \ I walked further into the monument, put a delicate kind of fear inside me. They\
  \ suggested a horror that had once been, a horror that could happen again; they\
  \ were pillars of suggestion rather than pillars of fact, of mourning. Where were\
  \ the poems, the tears, where were the names? My fingers ran across the concrete,\
  \ expecting to find the bumps and etchings that remembered those who died - I was\
  \ a blind man looking for braille, yet my hands almost flowed through the structures,\
  \ unopposed by tributes or messages. \n\nI had very quickly come to identify with\
  \ Berlin as a home away from home on this, my first ever visit to Germany. I had\
  \ already fallen in love with the colour of the city, the way the walls and floors\
  \ leapt out in celebration at passers-by, welcoming them with the brightest hues\
  \ that made even the greyest day seem full of joy. I loved turning around a random\
  \ street-corner and finding a homely coffee shop waiting for me there, or perhaps\
  \ a burger stand the colour of rainbows, or oh, how about a woman in the local park,\
  \ dancing and blowing bubbles to children around her? Berlin was, to me, a city\
  \ of culture, music and film and art hiding around every corner, a city of constant\
  \ surprises. \n\nAnd yet suddenly it was none of those things. The monument had\
  \ erased Berlin, erased everybody, and I found myself alone with these endless concrete\
  \ slabs, lined up like soldiers in wartime. I had spent the past few days surrounded\
  \ by the sound of the city, of talking and walking and driving and laughter, laughter\
  \ that couldn't be faked, the kind of laughter that you wake up every day for, and\
  \ now it was gone. Whether or not it was truly silent inside the memorial when I\
  \ visited is debatable of course, but that is how I personally remember the experience;\
  \ I remember the cold touch of the concrete and the way the structure seemed to\
  \ dim the skies above you the further you moved into it - I remember no sounds whatsoever.\
  \ \n\nI also remember the yellow umbrella. On this rainy day, sitting just on the\
  \ inside of The Memorial to the Murdered Jews of Europe, was a young woman protecting\
  \ herself from the elements with that bright flash of colour: her pose was carefree,\
  \ her tone clashing with the site she sat on. I will always remember her, for she\
  \ punctured the power of the memorial; she was Berlin, seeping into the mourning\
  \ of the monument. Each stone slab was flawless and yet here she was, the flaw in\
  \ the system, colour crawling through the cracks. I am unable to recall how I felt\
  \ about this image at that very moment, whether I appreciated the simple beauty\
  \ of her invasion or if I regarded her as out of place, an unwelcome reminder of\
  \ life in a place of death. I was younger then, perhaps unable to question her presence,\
  \ and even now I am unable to decide whether her image, her being there, is right\
  \ or wrong. \n\nI do remember the comfort of her colour though. Her yellow washed\
  \ away some of the fear that had been built by those concrete pillars, her yellow\
  \ brought me back to how I was before the memorial; happier, maybe na\xEFver. Maybe\
  \ she shouldn't have been there, maybe she lifted me out of a necessary fear, a\
  \ grief that hundreds of documentaries, books and names had not managed to provoke\
  \ from me, not until I stood in the middle of that maze of columns and slabs and\
  \ wordless, soundless walls and had felt alone. That yellow umbrella, drawing the\
  \ eye away from the grey concrete, the grey sky, rose me out of a world of understanding\
  \ and back into a world of ignorance. \n\nWhether I am grateful for the power of\
  \ that colour, the distraction of her visit, her invasion; I am unable to say."
