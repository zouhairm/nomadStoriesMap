Text: "I got an opportunity to visit Hyderabad for 4 days. The main purpose of our\
  \ visit was to attend office colleague\u2019s marriage. We decided to spend 2-3\
  \ days more on exploring the city which is famous for market and Biryani.\n\nHyderabad\
  \ city is the capital of Telangana State and temporary capital of Andhra Pradesh.\
  \ A city located on the bank of Musi River. It was established in 1591 by Muhammad\
  \ Quli Qutb Shah. In 1724, Mughal King Asif Jah I declared his dominion and created\
  \ his own empire, known as the Nizams of Hyderabad. Hyderabad means \"Haydar's city\"\
  \ from haydar (lion) and abad (city).\nAbout Hyderabad:\n               One more\
  \ story says that Muhammad Quli Qutb Shah, the founder of the city, named it \"\
  Bhagyanagar\" after Bhagmati, a local dancing girl with whom he had fallen in love.\
  \ She converted to Islam and adopted the title, Hyder Mahal. The city was renamed\
  \ Hyderabad in her honor.\n              Hyderabad is very well connected to Indian\
  \ cities by airlines, rail network, and Roads. New International airport \u201C\
  Rajiv Gandhi International Airport\u201D is located around 20km from the city."
