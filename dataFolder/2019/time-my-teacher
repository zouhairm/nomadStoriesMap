Text: "I hit the South Australian border with a rattle, and the snaking roads lawfully\
  \ consign me to 100kmph instead of WA\u2019s generous 110. \n\n\"Pfft!\" I say.\
  \ How can there be a law against a very god of windsped travel?\n\nOne by one, each\
  \ mile surrenders to my tyranny. My hands clench not the wheel of a hatchback, but\
  \ the tiller of an exploratory vessel. In the ignition is not the key to an engine,\
  \ but the promise of a treasure hunt. And under my itching right foot is not the\
  \ accelerator pedal, but the passport to change.\n\nIndeed, if you want to go anywhere\
  \ in life, you\u2019ve got to put your foot down.\n\nWhen you\u2019re twelve years\
  \ old, Dad drags you out of school and away from your cosy childhood universe for\
  \ an entire year, you don\u2019t expect it to be a good one. If you find yourself\
  \ crying every night because you\u2019re trying to sleep on all 40 centimetres of\
  \ the bottom bunk of a rickety caravan on the rear side of space, you don\u2019\
  t expect it\u2019s on your revisit list. \n\nAnd in spending the springtime of adolescence\
  \ driving the breadths and depths of Australia in the company of only your family\
  \ and the transients you meet, little do you realise the reverberations this experience\
  \ will have on your conception of home and the wider world.\n\nEvery seasoned road\
  \ tripper can relate to the hours glued to the carseat. It must have been what I\
  \ hated the most as a nomadic kid. \n\nFuel stops, pit stops, sick stops, tourist\
  \ stops, signs becoming blurred and speed limits even more so. In wild parts like\
  \ these, it doesn\u2019t matter how many fellow travellers you cross paths with\
  \ . . . you are unequivocally, utterly alone.\n\nWhen I was smaller I didn\u2019\
  t grasp how blinking huge the Nullarbor Plain really is. Deserts meant boredom and\
  \ gloom. Fair dinkum, I found wastelands and nothingness duller than the dark and\
  \ about as alluring as snake in your sleeping bag. So I\u2019d keep my eyes on the\
  \ pages of a book instead, ignoring the size completely.\n\nBut now, it\u2019s a\
  \ playground, and it\u2019s taken me back to those days as if the spirit of the\
  \ plains fancies giving me a second chance. \n\nI arrive at Bunda Cliffs, where\
  \ over 250,000 square kilometres of shrubby plateau meets the raging Southern Ocean\
  \ in a plummet of sheer limestone and sea spray. There is not a human to be seen.\n\
  \nIt\u2019s chances like these that reshape my sentiment. I shout as loud as my\
  \ throat can muster and no one can hear.  \n\n\u201CCan\u2019t I stay here forever?\u201D\
  \n\nThe sound is hurled away by the incessant gale. No one shouts back, except the\
  \ kid I used to be, saying, \u201CHurry up Dad, let\u2019s go now.\u201D\n\nIf she\
  \ was here with me now, I\u2019d tell her, \u201CHang on, you wombat! Just a minute\
  \ longer.\u201D\n\nThe only way to enjoy the desolation is to embrace the barrenness,\
  \ embrace the helplessness, and embrace the fact that if you run and run and run\
  \ you\u2019ll only reach another part of nowhere.\n\nI\u2019ve driven this road\
  \ before, but it\u2019s a new day. I skip and I sing and I think today\u2019s thoughts.\
  \ If I take one leap over the edge, this story will not be told, save in some passing\
  \ and regrettable mention at my funeral. If I step back, my eyes won\u2019t see\
  \ the splendour of the endless ocean as it throws itself against the rocks. All\
  \ I can do is stand and look out. This time I see: I really see.\n\nWhen I find\
  \ myself in solitude at the very place I never thought I would want to see again,\
  \ it strikes a match against the flint of my preconceptions. They melt like wax,\
  \ and I am a child again."
