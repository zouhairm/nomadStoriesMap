Text: "Back in 2011, I decided to trade in my 9 to 5 for the opportunity to move to\
  \ Costa Rica for a year. My plan was to learn Spanish, surf, find a job, and enjoy\
  \ life. Instead in that year, I learned who I was and my deeper connection to Costa\
  \ Rica. The country offered me love, tears, food, friends, and family. \n\nAs soon\
  \ as I landed, I fell in love with the people as they were so nice and every single\
  \ person greeted me along the way. The trip from the airport to my host family was\
  \ very different. In parts of Costa Rica, there are no street signs and in order\
  \ to get to my destination, the driver had to ask for directions. It is customary\
  \ in Costa Rica to give directions based on landmarks and items like a rock or supermarket.\
  \ After a few minutes, I made it to my destination, the kids came out running to\
  \ greet me and I felt at home. The fear I had with being in a different country\
  \ not knowing anyone had lifted. It was at that moment I knew I would be ok, I didn't\
  \ think these little boys would be that gift I needed to overcome my fear. \n\n\
  The year in Costa Rica was spent learning that when you open yourself to possibilities\
  \ anything is possible. After a few months, I had a really good job in an American\
  \ School teaching 3rd grade and a boyfriend. The teaching position was not expected\
  \ and I excelled so much that a position was created for me to run the entire Math\
  \ department for Junior and High School students. On the weekends my friends and\
  \ I would visit various parts of Costa Rica. One of the most memorable things about\
  \ my travel was the various temperatures, some places were so cold that there was\
  \ frost on the grass and other parts were so hot that you felt like you were melting.\
  \ During my travel, I gained about 50 lbs from eating and it was so worth it. I\
  \ ate Churros, oven-baked pizza, gio pintos, and many other things and I never thought\
  \ twice because it was so good. \n\nMy overall experience has left me unafraid of\
  \ the future or the unknown. I was very fortunate to have the freedom to take such\
  \ a big leap of faith. The leap has left me wanting to do it again and travel more\
  \ and as I travel continue to grow as a person and learn about myself."
