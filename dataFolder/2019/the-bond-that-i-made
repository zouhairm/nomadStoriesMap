Text: "As I landed on the Indonesian Airport of Bali, I could sense an air of heartwarming\
  \ simplicity and kindness in the expressions of the local who was there to greet\
  \ me - with his hands joined, and with a wide smile on his face- in broken english,\
  \ he said \"Namastee India!\" \nI'm an Indian, yes. No, we don't do that here. We\
  \ think too much. But Coco, he did not seem to have a care in the world. He was\
  \ happy. Annoyingly happy. Why? Because he had this mission of making friends from\
  \ every Country, culture and ethnicity there is. And Today he was going to be a\
  \ step closer to realising his dream. \"Friends?\" he asked, signalling for a handshake.\
  \ And that's the story of how I met my tour guide, who would later turn out to be\
  \ the reason I was able to feel Bali. \nWe got to talking. Had a beer or four. He\
  \ invited me to stay over. You see, I could've stayed in a fancy villa. I could've\
  \ hired a taxi. I could've gotten an official tour guide package. But then, Coco\
  \ would have missed out on the opportunity to \"wreck my life to watch this stupid\
  \ sunrise at 5 AM in the morning.\" Just add a \"Please Don't\" in the beginning\
  \ of this sentence and you'd have yourself a black haired, wheatish, middle aged,\
  \ married, man-teen making fun of a broke and brown semi-backpacker Indian,  for\
  \ three straight days, as they sip on a delicious, sort of creamy or maybe pulpy\
  \ kind of coffee, until one of them throws up, when he learns that it was made from\
  \ the coffee beans shat by a fox called 'Luwak.' \"Poop Coffee\", he called it.\
  \ Most expensive coffee in the world, more humour being derived at my expense by\
  \ Coco.\nDid I tell you he had a child of his own? An eleven year old beautiful\
  \ boy just as he was mischievous. Sunny. \nSo, his father earned bread and butter\
  \ for the family by working at a water sports company, ten hours a day. For eight\
  \ of them, I was his new found blood relative. He came with his perks. I got an\
  \ instant discount at all those street markets full of colourful, unique and somewhat\
  \ out of the box items which always sounded overpriced. To me. I'm not a big fan\
  \ of kids. But if he wants to terrify his dad with a bottle opener that looks like\
  \ a big penis. I'm all in. And that's the story of how Coco almost broke his beer\
  \ bottle when he got what he asked for. A bottle opener. \nThat's why you should\
  \ never leave me alone with kids. I'm a bad influence. But I can open beer bottles\
  \ with my mouth. And now, so can Coco. \nOn my last day in Bali, as a family, trip\
  \ Coco decided to take us Sea Walking. Except him, none of us knew how to swim.\
  \ \nI'd never been under water for more than 30 seconds. Yet, here we were, 17 feet\
  \ underwater, inside the reef. Between corals. Watching fish of most vivid colours,\
  \ shapes and sizes  And discovering the rich sea life underwater in the crystal\
  \ clear blue water of the lagoon. \nI can still hear the sound of water. I've heard\
  \ nothing like it. I can still dream of that marine life that we lived for a little\
  \ while as a family. I can still skype and reminisce with Coco's family, hear Sunny\
  \ call me his favourite Uncle, and feel all the love that I felt. I can still feel\
  \ the bond that I made, and I know I'll still feel all the happiness that I felt\
  \ - for forever and a day."
