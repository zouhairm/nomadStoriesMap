Text: "How much longer until we find a road? I force my foot down on the pedal of\
  \ my rented bicycle to keep going. Trying to navigate this sandy path is proving\
  \ difficult, and with sweat dripping in my eyes my energy and patience is beginning\
  \ to wear thin. \n  \n   It's 2017, and for my birthday I decide to fly to Sri Lanka\
  \ in search of empty beaches and long surf breaks. Im in the sleepy town of Arugum\
  \ Bay chasing rumors of a world class longboard break. My partner, Mark and I pay\
  \ the $2 rental fee, rent old one-speed bicycles, and head out in search of \"Elephant\
  \ Rock\". I pedal through town passing bus stations, fish vendors, and street dogs\
  \ laying in the shade of palms lining the road. Leaving town entering countryside,\
  \ we pass a woman walking a heard of goats down the road. \n   More than an hour\
  \ (and a few wrong turns) later, we cycle past a small village toward the coastline\
  \ and finally find the famed rock jetting out into the ocean. This rock is supposed\
  \ to create the perfect playground for a day of surf, but we find ourselves looking\
  \ out at a calm sea. No waves for us. After an hour of cycling against the wind\
  \ I am NOT ready to pedal back \"empty handed\". Tired, a bit hungry, and a lot\
  \ disappointed, I buy a coconut from a man selling them from a small fishing boat\
  \ that has been dragged onto the sand. I wade into the ocean to swim and take in\
  \ the beauty of the empty coast line. A mix of desert, jungle, and ocean, its unlike\
  \ any place Ive been before and the serenity of moment fills me with a warm contentment.\
  \ \n    Though we may not be ready, sunset is only an hour away and its time to\
  \ start making our way back to town. I keep losing my balance cutting my wheel through\
  \ soft sand and I get the feeling that the journey home is going to be a big task.\n\
  \n Step. Push. Sweat. Breathe. Keep going.\n\nSuddenly my concentration is broken\
  \ and I find myself in a remarkable scene; The light glowing warm filters through\
  \ the canopy overhead and shines yellow upon a group of young monks.  A procession\
  \ of shaved heads belonging to young men wearing beautiful orange tunics among the\
  \ greenery and tan of the dry sand paints an otherworldly picture. They exude excitement,\
  \ and wear huge smiles on their faces. We can't understand what they're saying but\
  \ see arm gestures, and finally catch one of them saying \"Big! ELEPHANT!\", but\
  \ they are all laughing wildly and I suspect they are just amused and having fun\
  \ with us; the foreigners struggling to bike through the forest. Still the vision\
  \ was incredible, and their energy was infectious giving us a boost to push forward.\
  \ \n   Suddenly, 20 yards down the path we hear a disturbance in the thick greenery\
  \ and the air feels thick with anticipation. It sounds as though trees are being\
  \ pushed down. Large footsteps. My breath catches in my throat. Im unable to move,\
  \ but can't seem to stop the involuntary shaking of my leg on my bike pedal. \n\n\
  What happens now? \"Don't move\" I whisper. \n\nI've never expected to accidentally\
  \ cross paths with a wild elephant. I don't know the protocol for this. We find\
  \ ourselves in a pregnant silence. I can feel the heavy anticipation of what comes\
  \ next in the air, a light static dancing on my skin like a breeze. \nThen we see\
  \ her. Small movements of her trunk. She's stopped as if, she too, is surprised\
  \ to see us and is likewise trying to plot her next move. The three of us suspended\
  \ together in this moment. Large and powerful, but strangely calm. It feels as though\
  \ we're there for ages, but in reality after a moment she calmly turns her head\
  \ and continues on her path to the watering hole. We listen to the trees shift as\
  \ she moves onward.  \nIt takes a few minutes to gather ourselves. Buzzing, we continue\
  \ on. I may not have gotten what I set out for, but left with something much bigger."
