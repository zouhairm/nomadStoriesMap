Text: "We came from various corners of the United States to build beds, skirt trailers\
  \ and build outhouses. Yes, I said outhouses. As you let that reality in our modern\
  \ world sink in, let me set the scene for you. Summer in South Dakota is hot and\
  \ winters are brutal. Nearly 130 years ago the American government brutally massacred\
  \ around 300 innocent individuals. \n\nToday there is progress on the Rez, but there\
  \ is still abject poverty and third-world style reality. I went there expecting\
  \ that reality, working to atone for the years of injustice the American government\
  \ has enacted on the Lakota people and to give back. What I didn't expect to find\
  \ was hope. After a week of work and making connections with the Lakota and those\
  \ who had come on the same journey I had, I found hope in the faces of the young\
  \ people who had traveled from a Washington, D.C., school, Michigan, and Iowa along\
  \ with the young people of the Lakota Nation. \n\nWounds such as those enacted at\
  \ the massacre site take time to heal, but if we can continue to learn, request\
  \ forgiveness and grant forgiveness a little with each generation, we may find in\
  \ time the reality is that we are all more alike than different and the promise\
  \ of hope is the pathway to truly realizing the power of our humanity."
