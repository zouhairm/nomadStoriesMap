Text: "There are places that captivates you the first time you set your foot on the\
  \ ground. However, there are times you end up in a place that you don\u2019t really\
  \ think of. I arrived in Abu Dhabi in 2017. It\u2019s only been 2 years. I came\
  \ to work here as a nurse. So this is not a travel story. Because I\u2019m not really\
  \ a traveller but I wanted too andI want to write about it too. This is how I see\
  \ things everyday. \nDid you know that the sky looks different here? I mean I don\u2019\
  t know if it\u2019s just me, when I look up it looks like it\u2019s so close to\
  \ us. It really looks like a painting from a ceiling. Apparently, you can\u2019\
  t see a lot of stars here because of too much light. Yep, electricity here is cheap.\
  \ What I like about it here is that, it\u2019s cleanliness and it doesn\u2019t look\
  \ like it\u2019s chaotic everyday. Even though I travel for almostan hour going\
  \ to work everyday, it\u2019s not really stressful on the road, although there are\
  \ traffic, somehow it\u2019s not stressful. I came from a third world country so\
  \ I like the convenience of living here. I also like my neighborhood, we live across\
  \ the mall. Everday you walk into the same alley and you see stores and cars park\
  \ in the sidewalk. Then you just get used to it. You get familiar with the surrounding\
  \ the people you see from your way to work. \nYou can\u2019t go to places when its\
  \ summer. It is really scorching. I mean I don\u2019t like summer here. We always\
  \ wait for winter. They call it winter even though it\u2019s really not that chilly.\
  \ It\u2019s windy and cold. That\u2019s the only time we can go somewhere. \nThere\u2019\
  s a lot of Filipinos here like me. I think most of the workers here are foreigners.\
  \ Day by day you just learn how to survive in a foreign country. When you live abroad,\
  \ your worst enemy is home sickness. Even if you get used to your surroundings,\
  \ your soul always search for that familiar place where your heart really belongs\
  \ too. It\u2019s a good thing there\u2019s a lot of shopping malls here where you\
  \ can just walk and kill time. Before I was like why there are a lot of malls here.\
  \ It\u2019s the one place to go on summer. Really. And people love to bond over\
  \ food. We always find time to eat and bond through food. Food is really our comfort.\
  \ \nWhen you go abroad, you meet new friends or acquintances. I am the type to get\
  \ attached to people easily. I mean not really get close, but I get sad because\
  \ the familiarity gets disturbed. You know like you get used seeing this person\
  \ at work everyday and suddenly they\u2019re not renewing their contracy. So that\u2019\
  s another changed. But there are also people you meet and get to talk to them for\
  \ 3 days. In that short period of time, they give you lifetime worth of life lessons.\
  \ There are also people you really can\u2019t get along with. Nevetheless, it\u2019\
  s still part of your experience. \nThis is a perspective from a worker like me in\
  \ a foreign land."
