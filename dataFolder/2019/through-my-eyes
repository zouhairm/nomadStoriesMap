Text: "South Africa was always on my list.  I\u2019ve always assumed that everyone\
  \ who loves to travel has a list, so SA was in mine.  I was attending a wedding\
  \ but that far beyond the reason I chose to visit SA.  I needed to experience SA\
  \ through my eyes and hope for the connection that I always imagined I would have.\
  \  For this very reason I made sure to stay miles from any of the wedding attendees\
  \ and experience south Africa and particularly Joburg for 7 uninterrupted days.\
  \  \n\n\nThis long awaited journey started with missing a connection flight to Amsterdam\
  \ where I was actually  to catch my flight to SA. Spent an unplanned extra \xA3\
  200 to make sure my itenirary was uninterrupted.  Somehow, someway I managed to\
  \ make it to Amsterdam in time for that flight to SA.  \n\n\n\u2018Cabin crew prepare\
  \ for landing\u2019 this was the minute my heart started racing with excitement.\
  \  I was here!! I was finally in South aftlrica.  Made it through immigration picked\
  \ my one piece which had somehow managed to get damaged but no way in hell was I\
  \ going to let that rain on my parade.  I was in Jozi!!! \n\nOut of the terminals,\
  \ flagged my Uber which had issues on its own.  Again, not letting anything rain\
  \ on my parade and made it to my Airbnb.  My host  was out of this world and that\
  \ was the very initial impression I got about south Africa. Settled into my  apartment\
  \ which to be very fair and honest is the best Airbnb I have stayed in whilst travelling.\
  \  We were already off to a great start.  Glorious,  bless her heart, went above\
  \ and beyond for me and I was already at home in South Africa.  \n\nIt was only\
  \ noon, Freshened up and I was ready to start my big explore.  Maboneng was a favourite\
  \ in a lot of the reviews I had read, so off we were to maboneng.  This is according\
  \ to me and you SHOULD trust me, the HEARTBEAT of Jozi.  There is art absolutely\
  \  everywhere and that opened up my soul to accepting this very beautiful part of\
  \ town.  \n\nMaboneng will always be a special one because I somehow reinvented\
  \ myself whilst there.  That is what maboneng does to you.  I spent pretty much\
  \ every night there because phuzo Thursday as much as it\u2019s a thing I believe\
  \ it\u2019s phuzo everyday.  Phuzo being what the locals refer to  drinks and alcohol\
  \ and it was clearer to me that the locals do enjoy a good brew.  Johannesburg has\
  \ some awesome hidden gems and this is definarely one of them.  \n\nFast forward\
  \ to my days in Jozi. There is not such thing as a timed public bus. Instead you\
  \ will flag down a mini bus with a series of hand signals only the locals understand\
  \ (and I am still trying to master 4 months post SA) to join the more than prescribed\
  \ number of passengers on their way somewhere. This is a norm in  Jozi! \n\nIt goes\
  \ without mentioning Soweto.  In my opinion this in one of the underrated townships.\
  \  During my tour I ate ox head from a street vendor and as it was a hot day stopped\
  \ at a local shebeen for cool drinks, try a Stoney ginger beer if you have a chance.\
  \ The Mandela house was one to top off my Soweto tour. It was in Soweto that I also\
  \ very forthwith made a  decision to bungee jump which is one of the activities\
  \ at the Soweto towers. Need I say adrenaline!!\nThe drive back to the city centre\
  \ was golf reef city and made it 225 meters below the surface of the earth through\
  \ dim passageways that miners in the late 1800s had navigated in search of gold.\
  \ \n\nSouth Africa opened my eyes to a lot of things.  A lot more about myself.\
  \  I lived through my fears whilst on this trip and I got to experience it like\
  \ a local.  Flagging local public transport eating chakalaka from an African restaurant\
  \ which has got to be my favourite dish now and finally being in the times with\
  \ the Jozi locals."
