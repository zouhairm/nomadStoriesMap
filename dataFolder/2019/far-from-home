Text: "The first time I went to Asia, I spent a month in the miraculous world of Shanghai,\
  \ China. I had travelled abroad before, but there was something vastly different\
  \ about the Orient. I rented a small studio apartment for the month and went for\
  \ a photography course with the School of Visual Arts. I had no idea what to expect,\
  \ but I knew it would definitely be an adventure.  After my time in China, I was\
  \ also planning to spend a week in Japan to sightsee some more and go to the major\
  \ cities like Tokyo and Osaka.\n    Time flew by, as a group we visited art galleries,\
  \ ventured to Suzhou (the water town) and Beijing. Explored the vast museums and\
  \ historic parts of the country, including the breathtaking Great Wall, that left\
  \ us all humble and in awe. We visited the sacred sites and temples and before I\
  \ knew it we had to go home. Well, everyone else was going home, but I couldn\u2019\
  t. See, I had a mishap towards the tail-end of my trip.\n     We had all boarded\
  \ a train for Beijing and the group leader had to collect our passports, upon returning\
  \ home I realized I had misplaced my passport, which wouldn\u2019t have been such\
  \ a problem if it didn\u2019t also contain my visa, which I needed to get out of\
  \ the country. \n   When I realized this, at first I was in a total frenzy, I was\
  \ hysterical, I was literally stuck in China, a foreign land where I knew NOBODY,\
  \ since my group had departed and also I didn\u2019t speak the language, except\
  \ for an occasional \u201CNi Hao\u201D which meant hello and I also knew how to\
  \ say thank you.\n    I had to first go to the US embassy in China to retrieve a\
  \ new passport and then go to the visa office to apply for a new visa which I discovered\
  \ would take a week. What was I to do? Well, I never thought of myself as a spiritual\
  \ person, but an angel appeared. I met a young Chinese girl who happened to speak\
  \ English and Japanese. She was a tour guide and I told her what happened to me,\
  \ she was empathetic and the extra week in China turned into a whirlwind of events\
  \ I could never even dream of.   \n    For a week we dined in finest restaurants,\
  \ got massages and went on a cruise around the Bund. She called my airline ANA and\
  \ somehow obliterated all of my change fees so my flight back to my hometown of\
  \ New York didn\u2019t cost a dime. To this day I have no idea how she did it or\
  \ why. I was so incredibly thankful, in a sea of people a total stranger came forward\
  \ and was my beacon. I actually still talk to her to this day!\n      On my flight\
  \ home there was a stopover in Narita, Japan. I didn\u2019t have enough time to\
  \ spend the day in Tokyo but I decided to spend the day at Narita-San temple which\
  \ was conveniently located right near the airport.\n    At the temple, a sense of\
  \ calm enveloped me, it was what I needed after the thrill and excitement of the\
  \ unknown. I was grateful that I had survived the experience and was finally on\
  \ my way home. \n      Every year there is a goma ritual at the temple where visitors\
  \ throw their prayers into a fire; I had never said any prayers the whole time I\
  \ was in Asia, but someone must have heard my plight somehow and answered them.\
  \ I went to China to take some photographs and stick to the itinerary for a month,\
  \ but reflecting on my trip at the temple\u2019s Pagoda of Peace, I knew an angel\
  \ must have changed my plans."
