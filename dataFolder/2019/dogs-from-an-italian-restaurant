Text: "It is Sunday, August 5th, 2018 and it is the 44th day of my friend and I\u2019\
  s cross-country road trip. In reality, this is more than a coast to coast joy ride.\
  \ We\u2019ve been driving a clockwise loop along the perimeter of America promoting\
  \ my nonprofit organization and working with different communities to facilitate\
  \ a \u201Cpay it forward\u201D initiative from city to city. My nonprofit, The Smile\
  \ Project, exists to spread Happiness through acts of kindness and we are about\
  \ to see how far one kind act can travel. \n\nWe are in Rapid City, South Dakota\
  \ and even though our campground beds are calling us, so is frozen dessert. I\u2019\
  ve had my eye on a Cookie Dough cone ever since I aimlessly Googled, \u201Cice cream\
  \ near me\u201D a few hours prior. My friend obliges; he is used to this. \n\nThat\u2019\
  s how we find ourselves nestling our blue Ford Focus rental car in between endless\
  \ rows of motorcycles on Main Street. It is Sturgis season and since Wyoming, we\u2019\
  ve been traveling with throngs of bikers on their way to the annual rally in the\
  \ small South Dakotan town 30 minutes from where we are staying. \n\nI cannot picture\
  \ how busy this street is on any given Sunday, but tonight, there are dozens of\
  \ people. At dinner. On a walk. Eating ice cream. Determined to join the latter\
  \ group, I skip-run to the intersection when my eyes spot the dog.\n\nA few feet\
  \ away, a well-groomed and frightened puppy is darting between cars on the road.\
  \ I lock eyes with sidewalk strangers. Here are my allies. \n\nWe are settled in\
  \ front of Botticelli's Italian Restaurant, a group of strangers now committed to\
  \ murmuring soothing tones in a gentle attempt to coax the dog out of the street.\
  \ Our army grows when two diners, a hostess, and the owner exit the restaurant to\
  \ join the fray. \n\nBefore any of us can agree to his idea, the owner tosses food\
  \ scraps on the ground which the dog skittishly runs to. The diner grabs the dog\u2019\
  s collar, much to his hysterical dismay and presumably solemn vow to never fall\
  \ for a bribe of table bread again. A police car drives past. Somebody whistles.\
  \ Animal control arrives. We have done it. \n\nJust as quickly as we came together,\
  \ we scatter. The diners return to their meals. The hostess and owner to work. The\
  \ couple continues down the street on their evening stroll. The animal control man\
  \ assures me that the dog likely has an owner and will be okay. \n\nI\u2019m swirling\
  \ my Cookie Dough storm with the small wooden spoon and replaying the scene. I turn\
  \ to my travel companion. \n\nI wish I could find a way to thank everyone in the\
  \ world who does the right thing without being asked. Who steps up and takes care\
  \ of other people when nobody is looking and when there is no possible chance of\
  \ reward. \n\nI don\u2019t give him time to respond. I am already walking out the\
  \ door and across the street. He is used to this. Before I can formulate my plan,\
  \ I find myself sharing my life story with the hostess, telling her about the road\
  \ trip, and handing her my credit card. \n\nLater that night, we arrive to our camp\
  \ ground and are laying out sleeping beds when I get a notification to The Smile\
  \ Project account. The diner is thanking us for his dinner. \n\nIt is August 15th,\
  \ 2018. There is only one day left in the road trip. We are in Youngstown, Ohio\
  \ at my friend\u2019s house. I receive an email from a name I do not recognize.\
  \ \n\nIt is the hostess from Botticelli\u2019s Italian Restaurant in Rapid City,\
  \ South Dakota. She is writing to tell me that she called the shelter the next day.\
  \ The owners were local and picked up their dog. She tells me she would have taken\
  \ the dog had he become adoptable. \n\nI am overwhelmed by the goodness of people.\
  \ My friend comes back to his room. He has only been gone for a few minutes and\
  \ yet he finds me in tears. I smile and show him the email. He is used to this."
