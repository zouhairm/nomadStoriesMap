Text: "At the age of six, I told my schoolyard friends of a place that I had found\
  \ in a library book. \u201CThe royal family lived there once,\u201D I explained\
  \ to them in a conversation that I can still vividly remember today, \u201Cand it\u2019\
  s the most beautiful place on earth. One day I\u2019m going to go there, and become\
  \ the Queen of France.\u201D\n\nEverything but that last sentence was true. To me,\
  \ Ch\xE2teau de Versailles certainly is the most beautiful place on earth (at least,\
  \ the most gorgeous man-made construction), but my definition of \u201Csoon\u201D\
  \ became fifteen years later, at the age of twenty-one\u2026 and of course, as far\
  \ as I know, I\u2019m still not the Queen of France.\n\nAs an avid traveller, Ville\
  \ de Versailles was a place I endlessly envisioned walking through. I pictured how\
  \ the stone roads would feel beneath my feet, how I would interact with the locals,\
  \ and especially the moment I turned the corner onto Avenue de Paris to see the\
  \ palace come into view. I always thought I\u2019d be so overwhelmed by finally\
  \ arriving in the \u2018Promised Land\u2019 that I would burst into tears; when\
  \ the day eventually came, I was surprised that I didn\u2019t.\n\nWalking through\
  \ the courtyard made me teary-eyed, but I felt more speechless from the sheer excitement\
  \ of the situation than anything else. Once we made our way into the main entrance\
  \ along the side of the palace, my hands began roving over everything: the towering\
  \ walls, the intricate moulding, the protruding cherub faces as we approached the\
  \ Royal Chapel. It was immediately as if I lost my vocabulary, other than the word\
  \ \u201Cwow\u201D tumbling from my lips like a broken record. From the King\u2019\
  s lavish apartments to the renowned Hall of Mirrors, everything about Ch\xE2teau\
  \ de Versailles left me breathlessly awestruck. The sheer grandeur of everything\
  \ enveloping me made my heart ache for this place that I would have to leave by\
  \ the end of the day. What\u2019s more, the thought that my favourite historical\
  \ figure, France\u2019s misunderstood Queen Marie Antoinette, walked those very\
  \ walls made my heart skip a beat.\n\nWhen we entered the gardens, we found our\
  \ way to the Orangerie, where I was immediately enraptured in photographing its\
  \ vivid greenery. Despite it being October and slightly chilly, much of the shrubbery\
  \ still held on to its vibrant colour. Thankfully, you can enjoy a great deal of\
  \ the gardens as you make your way toward the Trianons. For me, the Petit Trianon,\
  \ built between 1762 and 1768 during the reign of Louis XV of France, was a must-see.\
  \ It\u2019s located in the park of the Grand Trianon, rather close by. This became\
  \ the domain of Marie Antoinette during her reign of France, and the stunning miniature\
  \ neoclassical ch\xE2teau with perfectly manicured gardens swept me off my feet.\n\
  \nInside of this domain, I felt once again as if I had stepped back in time to the\
  \ opulence and splendour both of the eighteenth century, as well as the last monarchs\u2019\
  \ predecessors. From the slate and white checkered marble floors, the smooth stone\
  \ walls, and towering ceilings of the foyer, I was instantly enraptured by this\
  \ beautiful \u2018informal\u2019 palace. The chambers, though far smaller than those\
  \ of the main palace, were still beautifully decorated with intricate white wainscoting\
  \ on the walls offset by detailed coloured fabrics on all furniture and accompanying\
  \ d\xE9cor. I was absolutely in love.\n\nLeaving the Petit Trianon was as heart-wrenching\
  \ as leaving the Ch\xE2teau, more so because it was now nearing the evening and\
  \ thus, our time to leave Versailles. We boarded a little train that made its way\
  \ through the back roads of the gardens, passing by the picturesque Hamlet and sprawling\
  \ green fields with grazing sheep, the trees shading the path as we once again neared\
  \ the main palace and nearby exit.\n\nWhen the time came for me to leave my favourite\
  \ place on earth, I did so reluctantly. Walking along Avenue de Paris, I found myself\
  \ peering back over my shoulder at the ch\xE2teau, slowly moving out of sight. As\
  \ it finally disappeared, I turned my head forward with the knowledge that I would\
  \ one day return to this personally sacred space."
