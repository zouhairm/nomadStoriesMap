Text: "When I stepped off the jetway into the Amsterdam airport, I stepped into another\
  \ life.\n\nI had traveled internationally before this, but always to be met by someone.\
  \ This time I was on my own. My lodging was secure. Sarah and I had become good\
  \ friends after several years of weekly conference calls. She had opened their home\
  \ to me. \n\n\u201CI know a cheap hotel with good wine and bad attitude! Yours whenever\
  \ you want it.\u201D Who could resist?\n\nBut there would be no one to meet me and\
  \ my friends were several hours away. I would have to take a train to a small village\
  \ close to theirs where they could pick me up. There was little risk, the train\
  \ system is very well developed, and the central train station is one level underneath\
  \ the airport terminal.\n\nI knew all these facts but after I processed through\
  \ customs and collected my bag, I was swept along with the other travelers into\
  \ an enormous space. Confronted with the sheer size of the airport level, I felt\
  \ completely lost and alone, surrounded by masses of people who were largely unaware\
  \ of me and my anxiety. I trudged along with my suitcase and my laptop, determined\
  \ to make some sense of the signage.\n\nAfraid I might run out of building before\
  \ I found the train station, I stopped at one of the many currency exchange kiosks.\
  \ A kind-faced young woman offered assistance. I explained I needed the train and\
  \ had no idea where to go or what to do. She pointed out the exit to the station\
  \ as well as the ATM machine where I could get the Euros I would need. She also\
  \ advised that I make sure to choose the ticket window for one-time passes. Then\
  \ I could go to the platform for the correct train.\n\nI found the train level,\
  \ found the ticket windows, even found the correct line. The gruff older man at\
  \ the window was not impressed with my perseverance. Thankfully I knew my destination\
  \ and with barely three words to me, the man took my money and shoved a pass at\
  \ me.\n\u201CPlatform 7\u201D was all he said.\n\n\u201CCan you please tell me where\
  \ that is?\u201D For that I received a long stare, but he finally relented and pointed\
  \ to the ramp I needed.\n\nI waited for the train with a small group of travelers.\
  \ There was no obvious turnstile or other sign of ticket taker so I assumed that\
  \ would happen on the train. When the train arrived everyone quickly boarded and\
  \ took whatever seat they chose. \n\nWe pulled out of the station and into a beautiful\
  \ day, sunny and pleasantly cool. I marveled at the architecture that gave way to\
  \ a lush and welcoming countryside. The announcements for upcoming stops were made\
  \ first in Dutch then English. That was a relief as I had to transfer from the regional\
  \ rail line to a smaller local line. I noticed people leaving and boarding at the\
  \ stops we made, but still no sign of a ticket taker. Was it all on the honor system?\n\
  \nWhen my transfer point arrived, I managed to debark and board the new train with\
  \ no problem. Soon after we pulled away from the platform, an announcement came\
  \ regarding ticket validation. \u201CHave your pass available please.\u201D\n\n\
  I could see a man in uniform working his way through the car, his sturdy friendly\
  \ face the classic example of a conductor. \nWhen he came to me, I handed over my\
  \ pass. He scanned it with his handheld device, frowned a little, then asked me\
  \ something in Dutch. At my expression, he smiled and continued in English. \u201C\
  Did you validate your entry onto this train?\u201D\n\nI assured him I was unaware\
  \ of the need or the process. Apparently, the bollards on the platforms scan the\
  \ pass as the traveler passes but they must pass close enough. I was traveling off\
  \ the grid and throwing off their numbers! He was able to update everything manually,\
  \ so no harm, and he wished me a pleasant visit.\n\nI left the train at the tiny\
  \ little station and hoped I was ready for whatever came next."
