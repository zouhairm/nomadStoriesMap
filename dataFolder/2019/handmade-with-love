Text: "As I walk towards the alleys of the portugal city,I found a cobbler store,dressmaker\
  \ ,a flower shop and that divine smell of bread a local bakery just diverted my\
  \ attention towards it and I happen to enter the city's most famous cake and pattiserre\
  \ shop.\n\nMaking a local connection,people were in a queque to grab their most\
  \ favorite bakery biscuits,breads and cakes for afternoon tea and eveing dinner.\n\
  \nI could take as many photos as their was a lot of excitement in the air.\n\nAs\
  \ the tensions rise amongst the bakers the store had sold out!\n\nI got my favorite\
  \ desserts and the locals had reffered me to some of their favorite breads and pasteries.\n\
  \nEveryone was so warm,cosy and welcoming this beautiful city of fisheries,fabulous\
  \ marinas by the coast line.\n\nAmazes me as the sunsets and the skies have the\
  \ most beautiful and amazing colors,as the lanterns of the city switches on. \n\n\
  There are many homes where the day has ended and as I walk by all I can see is candle\
  \ lights .The statue structures on the streets are a bit darker now and its a little\
  \ bit scary...\n\nBut fortunately my gps helps me to locate the center of the city\
  \ and I find a fountain where lovers meet throw coins and make their own special\
  \ wishes.\n\nThe fountains are beautiful glowing and white under the moon light.\n\
  \nAs I walk pass by I locate the library and learn more about the city and tge things\
  \ to do while I am in Portugal.\n\nAnother day has ended and a new day is begining\
  \ to start with new places to discover about this magicial city.\n\nWith love"
