Text: "There is a celtic saying. That at the beggninning of our lives, we choose all\
  \ the obstacles we will face. Knowing that we will get through, but that they will\
  \ provide us with the lessons we need in order to shape who we are. After a traumatic\
  \ break-up, I decided that maybe i'd faced too many obstacles. What I needed was\
  \ time to go to the root of it all, to nature, to the landscape.\n\nIn my mind,\
  \ I wanted to plant myself somewhere as remote as possible. To get my hands dirty\
  \ with soil and remember what its like to truly need things. But still airing on\
  \ the side of perhaps 'country-cosmopolitan' I booked an eco-pod just outside Loch\
  \ Lomond, near the very lovely town of Drymen. \n\nMy lodgings were a very well\
  \ equipped pod, next to a rather nice family of chickens and an almost desperate\
  \ cat. I arrived. With plans to run 10 miles that day, hike at least 20 and rake\
  \ in as much peace as possible. From the distance between the morning, and late\
  \ afternoon, it had become painfully obvious I was to remain indoors for the rest\
  \ of the day as a cold set in deep from my bones. I laid down on the bed, staring\
  \ out the window at the beautiful views and Loch Lomond in the distnace. Enjoying\
  \ the bittersweet ironic bliss I had found for myself.\n\nThe next day I took my\
  \ explorations more gently. I walked into the centre of the village and befriended\
  \ a rathel lovely woman who spoke in that warm and gentle wrap your ears in cotton\
  \ kind of voice. I bought a map, and spoke to her for nearly an hour, about places\
  \ nearby with ancient stories or tales. She directed me to Aberfoyle, home to the\
  \ famous Faeries. On the way I stopped for a massage at a spiritual centre in the\
  \ middle of the woods 'Tir Na Nog' where I prayed that the smell of frankincense\
  \ alone would chase away my sickness. Almost. \n\nAt Aberfoyle I walked up the Doon\
  \ Hill, where the infamous reverend had dropped dead after writing his collections\
  \ of books about the Faeries and their antics. They say his soul is trapped at the\
  \ top and if you run around it seven times the Faeries will appear and take your\
  \ soul. I was willing to take my chances, it was a heartbreaking year. I walked\
  \ back down the hill and crossed the cemetery. A rainbow appeared stretched to what\
  \ looked like the top of the hill, and I smiled at the bittersweet irony. After\
  \ Aberfoyle, seeking other indoor exploits I drove myself to Sterling, to explore\
  \ the historical town and the castle. I'd missed the timing for entrance to the\
  \ castle, and found myself instead wandering through the cemetery. Old stone, and\
  \ glass cobbled and rolling together on the hillside. I took myself home, to bed,\
  \ to sleep. To sleep perchance to wake up feeling better...\n\nThe next day I did\
  \ a 12 mile walk from the eco-pod onto the west highland way and over the conic\
  \ hill. The aim was to walk and get the boat to Inchallaich, a small island in the\
  \ middle of the Loch known as 'The isle of the old hag'. When I got there the jeti\
  \ was flooded, rain had hit them hard that month, so instead I stood on the other\
  \ side of the Loch, thinking what a trade of it would be to have your own island,\
  \ but then to be deemed a hag for all eternity. I returned, and got myself ready\
  \ to attend a 'Dru' yoga class, as advised to me by Rachel. Myself and 5 other locals\
  \ under candlelight stretched. After finishing I took myself for a meal at the 'oldest\
  \ pub in Scotland..'. Later I drove to the Loch edge, and found myself under what\
  \ was the most spectacular moon rise. The moon, blushing, rose over Loch Lomond,\
  \ full beaming over the icy winds. I thought about how I'd driven all this way,\
  \ to run, walk, fly, and really, the best medicine was given to me standing still\
  \ in the Scottish wilderness. I smiled....enjoying the bittersweet ironic bliss."
