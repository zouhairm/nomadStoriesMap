Text: "It was the first time we were going to travel just the three of us after my\
  \ parents\u2019 divorce. It was the first time I would spend 24 hours per day, for\
  \ 12 days, with my father, since he left home years earlier. Our first time in Key\
  \ West. Clich\xE9 trip? A lot, but who does not like a clich\xE9?\n\nWe were anxious,\
  \ and because of that we got off almost immediately from the plane. All the way\
  \ by immigration office, luggage mat, until we finally reached the airport parking\
  \ seemed almost an eternity. Car properly rented, luggage and all passengers boarded.\
  \ Our journey would begin.\n\nAfter some misunderstandings (why do people \u2013\
  \ including my father \u2013 still prefer GPS to Waze?), we were finally on the\
  \ famous US Highway 1 on our way to Key West. Nothing people had told me or that\
  \ I had read planning our itinerary could live up to what really was this first\
  \ part of this family vacation. \n\nOne hour and a half of road and we reached the\
  \ first island just at the point where the highway begins to extend over the sea.\
  \ What a view! It all looked like a painting for us.\n\nAs we were advancing \u201C\
  into the sea\u201D we passed several charming little towns and the desire was to\
  \ stop after every mile crossed. The beach architecture, with wooden houses, suspended\
  \ to avoid the invasion of sea water, harmonizes with the local climate and give\
  \ the tour the feeling that we are in the United States of many years ago, with\
  \ strong Cuban influences, due to the proximity to Fidel\u2019s island.\n\nThe feeling\
  \ continued when we arrived at the charming Key West, the last island of Florida\
  \ Keys, \nknown for its clear and warm waters. Anxious to experience what the island\
  \ had to offer, we decided to leave our luggage and the car in the hotel, near to\
  \ the end of Duval Street and walk through the main streets of the island to enjoy\
  \ every moment.\n\nWe started at the Southernmost Point, and, as the name implies,\
  \ it is the closest point to Cuba, in the USA. We took some pictures (mandatory\
  \ because of the view) and decided to walk all over Duval Street, the main street\
  \ of the island, where is possible to find several restaurants, hotels and souvenir\
  \ shops, mostly made of beach-style wood. \n\nThe long walk has left us hungry and\
  \ the colored strip of the restaurant called \u201CEl meson de Pepe\u2019s\u201D\
  \ attracted us. We had a delicious cuban meal, with a key-lime pie of dessert and\
  \ then we watched Mallory Square\u2019s charming sunset before getting back to the\
  \ hotel to rest. \n\nWhat impressed us most in Key West was not only the breathtaking\
  \ scenario, nor the old Cuban-influenced architecture or the friendly people and\
  \ the divine cuisine. What struck us most was the ability to overcome of such island\
  \ with only 18.7 km2 of extension and its inhabitants that faced a Category 4 hurricane.\
  \ Not only the center but much of the island were already completely rebuilt on\
  \ our visit and rebuilt with the original design, with no sign of the damage they\
  \ had suffered a year before.\n\nSeeing such resilience, empathy our connection\
  \ with the people and the place were inevitable. Like Key West, my family also had\
  \ its ups and downs and had undergone a tremendous turnaround the previous year.\
  \ But still we were there, together, strengthened, reinvigorated, just like Key\
  \ West, which did not lose its luster even after the tragedy.\nLikewise, being in\
  \ such a powerful place and yet so fragile and vulnerable in the face of the power\
  \ of nature makes us reflect how much we care about things that are not so relevant\
  \ compared to others. It makes us glad for the ability and capability to see that\
  \ the world is much more than our problems, that nature is stronger than any human\
  \ force and therefore we have to know how to respect and live with it."
