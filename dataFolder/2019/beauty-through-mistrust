Text: "\"Where should we go? Greece? Italy?\" My roommate asked me as we brainstormed.\n\
  \ I thought about this for a second. Everyone in our London study abroad program\
  \ were going to these places. I wanted to immerse myself in a culture different\
  \ than mine, give my tourist dollars to a country that offered a different, much\
  \ less commercialized beauty. \n\"Morocco,\" I said. My roommate looked at me in\
  \ horror. \n\"2 females? Going to Africa, for the first time, alone!?\" She said.\
  \ It took a lot of convincing, but I knew she'd agree. Traveling for self growth\
  \ and expanding your perspective on life was far more valuable than just hitting\
  \ all the mainstream cities in Europe. On the way there, I felt really scared. We\
  \ had heard all the negative things: females are stared at and harassed if you look\
  \ like you don't belong, you are overcharged in the markets so badly once they hear\
  \ your accent. But in there was a touch of curiosity and excitement as well. We\
  \ arrived at night and we didn't know a drop of Arabic but managed to make it to\
  \ our resort safely. My resort was an out of this world kind of gorgeous. It looked\
  \ like an actual palace. But surrounding it was a village tainted with poverty.\
  \ I had never considered myself privileged, but i was humbled very quickly by my\
  \ surroundings. Our first full day in Morocco was gorgeous and terrifying. We hired\
  \ a driver that took us all around the city. We completely trusted our driver, who\
  \ took us to a boutique clothing store where management was so nice to us and showed\
  \ us their finest clothing. Lost in the moment and glamour of the moment, I purchased\
  \ 2 scarves for $100 USD, equivalent to about $1000 dirhams. My friend bought over\
  \ $300 USD in clothing as well. We were, in the moment, very happy with our purchases.\
  \ After this, it was late in the evening when our driver took us to Jemaa-el-Fna,\
  \ the market. We wore dresses past our knees with scarves around us but i noticed\
  \ men staring at our ankles, whispering rude things in our ear. A group of snake\
  \ charmers put on a performance right in front of us, and when we didn't have the\
  \ cash to tip them, they cursed us badly and yelled. We were so scared and surprised\
  \ by all this. As I walk through the market, I started to see scarves that looked\
  \ similar to what I bought. Being a finance major, I was interested, so I asked\
  \ the price.\n\"50 dirham,\" the man said.\n People wanted to sellout whatever they\
  \ had. My heart dropped. The scarf I had just bought was charged 10 times more than\
  \ its actual value! I felt cheated. I quickly said no thank you and kept walking,\
  \ then he dropped the price lower to $4 USD. A college student who scraped money\
  \ together to have this experience had been cheated by grown people who claimed\
  \ to be so holy and religious. Me and my roommate were so upset that we trusted\
  \ so blindly in our driver and the places he took us. I hated Morocco lost trust\
  \ completely thereafter. Fortunately, through sharing our story, we met locals who\
  \ were extremely religious and genuinely wanted to help us. We were able to get\
  \ our money back completely! One man named Abdullah treated us so well and I will\
  \ never forget how he went out of his way to help us see the actual beauty of the\
  \ city. We met him by chance and he was able to turn our entire trip around. I spent\
  \ 4 more days in Marrakesh and went through a whirlwind of emotions. I met so many\
  \ genuine people, I was immersed in the Muslim culture and I changed completely\
  \ as a person. With this new grown confidence and individuality I now feel comfortable\
  \ traveling anywhere in the world. Morocco will always be my favorite. It is said\
  \ that there are certain places on the surface of the Earth possess more magic than\
  \ others, and one of those places is Marrakesh. A truth I got to experience at 20\
  \ years old that I will never forget."
