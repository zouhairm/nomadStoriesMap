Text: "The sun woke us up in the morning. We were in a small forested enclave, off\
  \ from the highway. I didn\u2019t know the time, though the sweat on my cheeks and\
  \ the heat in the tent indicated it was time to get up. \LToday we hiked to Kuelap,\
  \ fortress of the Chachapoyans, a pre-Inca culture from northern Peru. \LPacking\
  \ up quickly, we followed the small brook to the town, Tingo.\L\nFrom here we made\
  \ our way.\n\n\L\LKuelap \u2013 Fortress of the Cloud Warriors\L\nMarked the sign.\n\
  \LThe 8 kilometre trail started at an altitude of 1800 metres, finishing at 3000.\n\
  \L\u201CHow long will that take?\u201D\n\L\u201CI think about 4 hours.\u201D\n\n\
  \L\LI danced ahead, rocks flying by my feet. \n\L\u201CDiego, it\u2019s beautiful!\u201D\
  \ I laughed.\L\nAn hour in the sun and we were sweating, with no idea what was ahead.\L\
  \nLocally the area is known as the tierra, east of the Andes, before the Amazon.\
  \ Deep valleys and high mountains carve the forested landscape. \LThe Chachapoyans,\
  \ or Cloud Warriors in their own language, built their fortresses at the heights\
  \ of these mountains to be closer to their gods.\n\n\LAnother hour. Our easy incline\
  \ steadily dramatising into an upward scramble.\L\nWe had underestimated a rise\
  \ in altitude of over a kilometre. \n\L\u201CHey,\u201D Diego called. \u201CLet\u2019\
  s stop and rest a bit.\u201D\L\nI looked up, hands on knees, panting. I nodded.\
  \ \LDiego was in front now and I dragged myself to him.\L\nHe looked over the mountain,\
  \ opening a can of tuna when I arrived.\n\L\u201CWe should have packed more food.\u201D\
  \ He said with a chuckle. \L\nWe would have, but had run out of cash days ago. \L\
  \n\u201CProbably?\u201D I jested. \n\LSitting down next to him I grabbed a cracker\
  \ and spooned myself some tuna straight from the tin.\n\n\L\u201CBriana, look!\u201D\
  \n\LI turned, looking at the distance we had covered. The earth dropped away.\L\n\
  Diego pointed to the rain above the river. We were so far up and the river so far\
  \ down, that as the rain fell, it fell further than below us. We watched the rain\
  \ subside our feet and, suspended, slowly seep towards the ground. It was the most\
  \ beautiful thing I had ever seen.\L\n\u201CThank you.\u201D I said.\L\n\u201CNo\
  \ worries.\u201D\n\n\L\LUp and up we walked, realising slowly how absolutely underprepared\
  \ we were. \L\nHigher altitudes meant a shift in climate, which we hadn\u2019t considered.\
  \ \LWe climbed into a cloud and didn\u2019t climb out. Our summer shirts now inadequate,\
  \  we struggled along the dangerously muddy path. \L\L\n\nWe passed a small, thatched\
  \ hut off to the side. Underneath, sheltered from the weather, sat some local farmers.\
  \ They beckoned us to come out of the rain. \LShivering, I was passed something\
  \ hot to drink, only just managing to mutter something resembling a thanks.\L\n\
  The men told us we had only 2 kilometres to go, so, with fresh warmth, we trod forward.\
  \ \L\L\n\nThis was it! We were almost there. Shrouded in clouds, it seemed fitting\
  \ that we wouldn\u2019t see the end until we got there.\n\LZigzagging up the mountain\
  \ we clambered up the last leg of our ascent, some 7 hours after we had set for\
  \ the summit.\n\u201CDiego, we\u2019re so close!\u201D\L\n\u201CKeep going!\u201D\
  \n\LDelirious with exhaustion and euphoric with anticipation both, we pushed forward\
  \ through the clearing clouds. \n\n\L\LTowering up towards the gods, the walls stood\
  \ some 300 feet. The Chachapoyans had earned their name. \L\nThese Warriors of the\
  \ Clouds had carried the stones to build this fortress, up the same path that Diego\
  \ and I had fought to complete.\L\nWe saw the inscriptions of their blood demanding\
  \ gods, the round houses that defied all architectural logic and the pits of bones\
  \ under their temples. The settlement once housed 300000 inhabitants and dates from\
  \ 500AD until the Spanish drove them to flee in 1570. \n\n\L\LRaptured and exhausted\
  \ we explored the ruin, only half uncovered, the rest still unexplored. \n\LThen,\
  \ as the sun set, we stood on the crest of the cliff and looked out above the Andes,\
  \ over the peaks and passes and into the clouds of the Chachapoyans.\L\nWe stretched\
  \ our arms out and lifted our bodies to the sky and we laughed. \L\nWe were Warriors\
  \ of the Clouds!\L\L\n\nAnd now to hike back down."
