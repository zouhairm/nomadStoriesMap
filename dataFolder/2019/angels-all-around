Text: "It was a period of many endings, and life wanted me to jump naked into the\
  \ deep water of existence.  \nI have just finished my Bachelor's degree with honors,\
  \ my work as a research assistant came to an end, and the cherry at the top was\
  \ an out-of-the-deep-blue break up from the man who used to be my lover, partner\
  \ for crime and best friend in the previous 5 years. We had big plans for the future,\
  \ but we both felt like our relationship is slipping through our fingers. In Hebrew\
  \ we say, 'the man plan and god laughs' and indeed at that time I felt like someone\
  \ up there is making a good joke about me. It was summer 2016, and the first year\
  \ that young Israeli could apply for a working holiday visa in the land of endless\
  \ sunshine, kangaroos and vegemite. My strong intuition told me that this is exactly\
  \ what I need; Australia. Get a one way ticket to the other side of the world with\
  \ zero plans, with options to gain my own banana bread and to experience myself\
  \ detached from anything I could call 'familiar' or 'comfortable'. It was my soul's\
  \ request to expand, to get to know oneself and to feel the unknown. \n\nNovember\
  \ 16th, 4 days after my 25th birthday party. I was in my childhood bedroom at my\
  \ parent's house, deciding which jeans to pack, should I take this jacket or my\
  \ mama's hippie shirt from the 70th, yoga met- yes or no? I was excited and anxious\
  \ at once, struggling to pack my life into a 70 liters back pack. My phone rang\
  \ and my good-friend-semi-sister Nitsi was on the line. \"How are doing my angel?\"\
  \ she asked me with her soft voice, and I said that I feel like I am drowning in\
  \ an ocean of decisions. Not long after, Nitsi was at my childhood bedroom, with\
  \ a glass of Merlot in her hand, encouraging me towards the transformation I was\
  \ about to go through. The following morning, my mom made breakfast, my dad was\
  \ reading the newspaper and my brother was telling me about his new girlfriend.\
  \ The next thing Iv'e noticed was me sitting in the airplane next to the window\
  \ seeing how my country is turning smaller and smaller until there were only clouds.\
  \ I landed in Melbourne. I pre-booked a bed at a hostel that was extra cheap for\
  \ Jewish and Israeli, since the owner was a Christian believer who cherished the\
  \ chosen people according to the bible. Myself, I am a secular, modern and a free\
  \ spirit lady who was just looking for the cheapest place to lay my head down at\
  \ night. \n\nToni, the hostel owner picked me up from the train station. He seemed\
  \ like an old country-side man with a good heart and pure intentions. My senses\
  \ were sharp as a knife as I was viewing, smelling and breathing the air of the\
  \ new. We reached to the suburban hostel and I entered to the main hall. There,\
  \ he was sitting, a beautiful Israeli guy, reading his book and drinking coffee.\
  \ I approached him and introduced myself. Amir was just about to go to the city\
  \ center to practice some wall climbing and he kindly offered me to join. I happily\
  \ agreed, and there I was, climbing on the wall, symbolically marking my first day\
  \ in Melbourne as an elevation of body and spirit. Amir later offered to prepare\
  \ my dinner and to give me useful advices. Time with him felt like magic as he was\
  \ my angel for that day. After dinner, as I was about to go to sleep my jet leg,\
  \ I got a message from Nitsi, \"Girl! my cousin is in Melbourne too, I've just discovered\
  \ that, you should contact him, he is awsome!\". What a funny coincidence I thought\
  \ to myself, and asked for his phone number. I called her cousin and suddendly heard\
  \ a phone ringing in the main hall. Amir's phone was ringing. He looked up at me\
  \ saying: \"Are you Nitsi's friend?\" I was shocked. \"Are you her cousin?\" and\
  \ we both laughed our way to bed."
