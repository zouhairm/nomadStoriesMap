Text: "My new friend and I made our way along Babs Animashaun street in Surulere when\
  \ suddenly he stopped and backtracked into an amply spaced compound. There were\
  \ a few men seated in the premises, on the patio of the pale-coloured bungalow in\
  \ the corner.\n\nAs we approached, I counted seven plastic tables, and accompanying\
  \ chairs clustered around them. The men were drinking, and as we settled into our\
  \ seats, my watch read 7.02pm. \n\nWe had barely sat when a young man approached\
  \ us with a can of milk. I looked at my friend, bewildered. He smiled. \n\n\u2018\
  What do they serve here?\u2019 I asked.\n\u2018Watch and see.' friend said, with\
  \ an air of mystery.\nI did watch, intently.\n\nOur young man retreated after setting\
  \ down the now punctured can on our table, and returned with with a transparent\
  \ plastic bottle of cream-like fluid. He shook it, unscrewed the top, picked up\
  \ the milk can and tipped its contents into the bottle.  He went ahead to shake\
  \ it vigorously, and then emptied the mix into our cups. \n\nThe moment the fluid\
  \ hit my buds, I questioned, 'Kunu?! \nFriend nodded. Yes.\n\nIt was chilled. The\
  \ creamy mix made from cow milk seemed to ease the tense muscles of my throat as\
  \ it worked its way down.\n\nThe extended patio on which we were deliriously sprawled\
  \ was occupied by almost a dozen men.\n\n\u2018A lot of men come here to drink.\
  \ Some take in as much as three litres of kunu in a sitting.\u2019 my companion\
  \ proffered.\nWe watched as a man strolled in and ordered six one - litre bottles\
  \ to take away.\n\nBottle after bottle made their way to the tables with raucous\
  \ groups of men ordering seemingly non-stop. Some sipped silently, as if in meditation.\n\
  I was indeed marveled. I had always thought that alcohol was what it took to bring\
  \ a group of prosperous men together in these parts. \nI was wrong.\n\nAs we downed\
  \ the last of our drinks, friend signalled for us to leave.\nWe paid, strolled out,\
  \ and hopped into the nearest Keke. The minuscule vehicle lurched jauntily along\
  \ over the ditch-like holes in the road, throwing us awkwardly about until we got\
  \ to our destination\u2026 a large expanse of activity. \n\nThey call it Doyin.\
  \ And what we came to do? To buy freshly roasted corn and huge, roasted native pears\
  \ also known as ube.\n\nAnd did my eyes behold! There were hundreds, maybe thousands\
  \ of people weaving hastily along with practiced ease in that bed of ongoing, noisy\
  \ trade. Doyin was a hub. It was an expanse that spanned as far as the eyes could\
  \ see. \n\nTraders sold their wares, lined in arrangements only they could fathom.\
  \ Bus conductors hogged their spots, hollering at the top of their voices for passengers.\
  \ Children in split seconds, wormed their way through the tiny cracks in human traffic,\
  \ and small wooden structures were set haphazardly on jutting rocks. It was cacophony!\n\
  \nWe elbowed our way through the river of people to a spot where friend came to\
  \ a stop. In front of us was a horizontal line of people. I peeked over them and\
  \ there they were - the objects of our purpose. My salivary glands tickled as the\
  \ oh-so-sweet aroma of roasting corn and ube wafted into my nostrils.\n\nAlready,\
  \ there were three men in front of our chosen seller. I looked past her and saw\
  \ another corn seller, and another, and yet another! They were lined up as far as\
  \ the eyes could see, and down a corner where my eyes could not see. Throngs of\
  \ buyers stood before them, touching,  pointing, selecting. The smoldering, giant-sized\
  \ pears took my attention totally, begging me to reach out and snatch them up!\n\
  \nWe made our selection and as we waited for our order to be prepared, slurped on\
  \ four turgid, dripping pears while constantly shifting our bodies to allow for\
  \ moving pedestrians pressing past us on all sides.\n\nActivity three involved sitting\
  \ at an outdoor bar, watching the traffic go by as we devoured our spoils and some\
  \ cold bottles of beer with friends who stumbled on the little party. It doesn't\
  \ get better than living in Lagos.\n\nThis is Nigeria."
