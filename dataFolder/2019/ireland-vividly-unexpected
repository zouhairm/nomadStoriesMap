Text: "I've always loved traveling, if even a few hours away. There's always a new\
  \ discovery awaiting. I wanted to begin traveling more within Europe.  Ireland has\
  \ always been at the top of my \"must see\" list of countries,  with its beautiful\
  \ landscapes.  I also wanted to learn of my ancestry there.\n\nI planned my 7 day\
  \ trip, with the intent to see the beauty of Ireland. I knew I would interact more\
  \ locally with the people, as I was also visiting a dear friend.  I thought \"heck,\
  \ St. Patrick's day is an awesome time to book an Irish experience! Right?\" Boy\
  \ was I right!\n\nWhen I arrived in Dublin, just days before the holiday,  there\
  \ had been no rain. Which was very unusual.  Natives were apologizing for the lack\
  \ luster of the emerald isle.  They said it was barely green! For me it was as if\
  \ I'd stepped onto set of, lord of the rings!\n\nIreland is so incredibly breathtaking,\
  \ in many ways! There is a powerful energy there. For me, it almost seems as if\
  \ somehow the sky is closer to you. The air is fresh and brisk! The land is vast\
  \ & GREEN!\n\nI was surprised to find:  The water from the tap was cool, refreshing\
  \ and as pure as the driven snow!  You never need a bottle unless you want w/gas.\
  \  My friends uncle baked delightful brown bread, atop which, the most creamy, dreamy,\
  \ Irish butter was spread. It was so warm, my heart melted too with the first bite!!!\n\
  \nWe went to Temple bar then Brazen Head for rugby (I learned to scrum) & my first\
  \ pint of Guinness! It's the 1st beer I ever tried & loved!!  Every single Irish\
  \ person I met there was  genuinely nice. I'm talking nice as in, there is twinkle\
  \ in their eyes even! I dare say! I really wasn't expecting that.\n\nAfterwards,\
  \ at my hotel, the Merion, we had a bowl of some of the best lamb shank stew ever.\
  \ The combination of flavors so rich. The broth was dark, smooth, almost like gravy.\
  \ The shank so tender, & there were roasted potatoes, tomatoes; bright fleshy carrot.\
  \ \n\nTo date, that was 1 most amazing carrot of my life! It was nicely roasted\
  \ inside, yet it gave a nice snap sound when you bit into it. I think there was\
  \ even a parsnip in my bowl! Wow\n\nSt Patrick's day! There was a parade in Dublin!\
  \ In comparison, USA makes a big deal for St. Pats, like Boston,  New York, Chicago\
  \  (even dyes the river green). In Ireland it's a beloved holiday. However, there\
  \ is not that much put into the parade. It was less than one hour long!\n\nThere\
  \ was a cool upstairs live jazz bar later, called JJ Smyth's. I really enjoyed the\
  \ warm vibe and spoke with some of the band members who told me of a party nearby.\
  \ So we walked across the Dublin bridge, which I found out was built by one of my\
  \ ancestors (a doyle)!\n\nWhat an amazing piece of history!  Walking on it with\
  \ me were people shooting dice, making out,  staggering, singing, fighting; vomiting.\
  \ (Aha) Also, I was harassed by gypsies on this bridge; then rescued by a fair,\
  \ short local girl. \n\nAfter some time walking behind my friend (drunk not helpful\
  \ lol) and I...she witnessed my soft, yet ineffective attempt to shoe away the gypsies.\
  \  They just kept coming! Finally, she walks up in front of me; says to them, \"\
  Feck off\" and they all did as told. I thanked her. With her eye twinkle in tact,\
  \ she gestured us back in front of her & we crossed safely. \n\nWe arrived at a\
  \ great party, lots of dancing, lovely smiles. There was no guinness hangover with\
  \ no liquor! The next morning, we walked to see the gorgeous water near Dublin Bay.\
  \ It's so green it beckons you! It's too cold though!\n\nLastly, I visited the real\
  \ Hollywood!! It is there! Surrounded by vines and intricate thick green tapestry.\
  \ The best thing aside from the hiking views...duck pate on crisp brown toast that\
  \ was soaked in something delicious, topped with cream cheese & lingonberry jam.\
  \ As I left Ireland it rained at last! Ireland, is vividly unexpected!"
