Text: "Being new to tourism on a scale, travel in Cuba is not your typical adventure.\
  \ I had no mobile reception upon arrival and internet is only available in certain\
  \ areas (usually parks) and you need to buy a scratch card from a kiosk to get access.\
  \ If you\u2019re lucky there won\u2019t be a queue\u2026.however Cubans love to\
  \ queue. My first afternoon I tried to buy a bottle of water in a shop but got confused\
  \ and left empty handed. The secret is you have to find \u2018el ultima\u2019 ie.\
  \ the last person in the queue. Then you announce yourself to be the new \u2018\
  el ultima\u2019 until a new shopper arrives and then they become \u2018el ultima\u2019\
  . So it\u2019s just a group of people jostling for last position and then they get\
  \ to buy whatever they\u2019re queuing for. Somehow it works.\n\nI digress. It\u2019\
  s refreshing and fun in the age of instant gratification to have to work stuff out\
  \ for yourself. It\u2019s one of the places in the world where a good guidebook\
  \ can be a saviour, as is a knowledge of and willingness to attempt the local language.\
  \ \n\nIn most places, accommodation is available in two varieties. Fancy-pants hotel\
  \ or \u2018casa particulares\u2019. I\u2019ve booked into the latter and whilst\
  \ in Havana this is a cross between a hostel and an Airbnb at cheap and cheerful\
  \ \u2018Casa de Ania\u2019. The city is vast, split between the old town which is\
  \ colonial and charismatic and the new town which looks like a zombie apocalypse\
  \ may have happened. But when you look closer into the semi-abandoned houses and\
  \ shops you discover random industries as the city starts to find its way back to\
  \ life after years of oppression. \n\nThere is a charm and energy to this country\
  \ that is addictive. Its colourful history holds many stories and perspectives to\
  \ discover, the most interesting of which is held in the Museum de la Revolucion.\
  \ To summarise, anything that happened in the last 70 years is America\u2019s fault.\n\
  \nA large part of its energy comes from the music, the dancing and the passion of\
  \ the people. Cubans are warm, friendly and helpful, and even walking through the\
  \ city at night feels safe. I take a couple of Cuban salsa lessons and whilst I\
  \ reckon I\u2019ve got rhythm it starts out feeling like an awkward scene from Dirty\
  \ Dancing. But after 45 minutes I\u2019ve learnt 6 steps and 3 turns and it\u2019\
  s a ridiculous amount of fun. I\u2019m ready for a couple of mojitos and the famous\
  \ nightlife of Havana starting in the raucous El Floridita, said to be Ernest Hemingway\u2019\
  s favourite haunt. Then onto the rooftop bar of the Gran Hotel where locals and\
  \ tourists mingle to the steamy sounds of a live Cuban salsa band.\n\nAfter 3 days\
  \ I\u2019m exhausted and sleep for most the 5 hour drive to the UNESCO world heritage\
  \ site of Trinidad. Another new service is the \u2018taxi collectivo\u2019 between\
  \ cities, rather than the regular government bus service. It\u2019s a door-to-door\
  \ shared taxi service for around the same price and can be booked from your accommodation\
  \ - an example of how locals are embracing the opportunity for enterprise brought\
  \ by tourism.\n\nI like the gentle pace of Trinidad. Cosy cobbled streets and the\
  \ same friendly locals\u2026 more horses and less cars. This time I am staying in\
  \ a real Casa Particulares with a woman named Lucia and her family and although\
  \ I\u2019ve never met them before it feels like coming home (they feed me constantly).\
  \ \nA short 7km trike or bicycle ride from the city brings you to popular Playa\
  \ La Boca. But if you venture another km or two past the bustle you can discover\
  \ secluded beaches with rocky steps into the azure of the Caribbean, the perfect\
  \ spot to chill with a cerveza. In the evenings Trinidad\u2019s restaurant scene\
  \ is more impressive than Havana\u2019s; and the \u2018Casa del la Musica\u2019\
  \ the place to be to soak up the Cuban rum and vibes.\n\nLast stop Vinales, 200km\
  \ west of Havana in the countryside, with its spectacular mogotes, amazing food\
  \ and rural lifestyle. Before I arrive I know I\u2019ll be back to explore this\
  \ beautiful crazy country further. Cuba, te amo."
