Text: "Eight well-spent days on the island of Cuba in January 2017 would change the\
  \ life and mentality of two New York City graduate students forever. Christa and\
  \ myself were two classmates from different backgrounds and ethnicities. We traveled\
  \ to Cuba on a school project that was meant to visualize and document how the long-standing\
  \ Cuban immigration and the endless separation of families under Fidel Castro\u2019\
  s regime would change after the then recent thaw in US-Cuba relations. \n\nLong\
  \ before our trip, while on a bus home, a nice lady with a Cuban accent was on the\
  \ phone on the other side of the bus. As soon as she hang up, we approached her\
  \ and in a surprising tone she confirmed she was of Cuban origin. It took us both\
  \ only a glimpse of a second to think she might know people that could help us through\
  \ our project. She had family there indeed, her beloved sister whom she hadn\u2019\
  t seen in years. \n\nOlguita is a proud Cuban, a smart and knowledgeable lady in\
  \ her mid-seventies. Before the heart-warming experience on the island of Cuba was\
  \ over, we had to listen to her story last. Out of love for her city and her sister,\
  \ she offered herself to be our tour guide for the last day of our trip. \n\nFrom\
  \ her happy, always smiling face we could tell how much she enjoyed moving forward.\
  \ The new construction sites in the port of Havana meant a lot more to her than\
  \ to us. She had seen the island in its worst days. She saw her sister leaving for\
  \ the United States and never coming back because she was not on Fidel\u2019s side\
  \ or the revolution\u2019s. Olguita had traveled many times abroad and would do\
  \ it again. \n\nShe remembered the days when the Operation Peter Pan took place,\
  \ a mass exodus of thousands of Cuban minors to the United States. She said the\
  \ Church convinced the parents to send the kids away for a better life but they\
  \ never heard back from them. The postal services being suspended back in the day,\
  \ there was no hope for finding them again.\n\nAs we passed from desolate stores,\
  \ empty of merchandise, Olguita explained us how she was making a living with her\
  \ insufficient pension of twenty-five pesos a month, after forty years in education.\
  \ \u201CThere is no such thing as a weekly budget for the supermarket. We look how\
  \ we\u2019ll make it day by day. We get a few vegetables here and there and when\
  \ we get lucky we\u2019ll add some meat,\u201D she calmly recounted.\n  \nOur promenade\
  \ got us to the backyard of a local church. As if that made her feel free, Olguita\
  \ recalled what must have been the toughest moment of her life. Her father was very\
  \ sick and she had no medication or food to give him. She used to peel off pineapple\
  \ skin and cook with rice for lunch and dinner every day. She burst into tears.\
  \ She knew there was nothing else she could have done, but deep in her heart she\
  \ felt guilty for not being able to help him.\n\nA warm and powerful smile followed\
  \ a moment of silence. She stood up, wiped off her tears and said \u201CThere\u2019\
  s so much more of the city I want to show you\u201D while she grabbed us from the\
  \ hand to get us going."
