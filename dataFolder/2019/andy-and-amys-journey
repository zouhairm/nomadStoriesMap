Text: "The journey that Andy and Amy have been on to arrive at this point in time,\
  \ is truly an exciting tale.\n\n10 years ago they packed their bags, left home,\
  \ crossed a few motorways, a field, down a cobblestone walkway of the lion and lamb\
  \ and tucked behind a Waitrose car park was a small University, where they fell\
  \ in love.\n\nFriendships formed and chaos ensued! Union escapades which resulted\
  \ in a turn table of someone carrying someone home, Andy and Amy playing mum and\
  \ dad to group of unlikely surrogate lost boys, a drummer, and a few rather fabulous\
  \ young ladies.\nWe had family Sunday roasts, piles of golden crispy roast potatoes,\
  \ drunk stolen cinnamon shots, and hung trollies out of windows.  Whilst we were\
  \ all having so much fun Andy and Amy would have not so secrete date nights. We\
  \ all knew, why else would Andy let Amy straighten his hair?\n\nThose years flew\
  \ by and you both graduated with incredible results and from that point onwards\
  \ your lives grew and you house has filled to capacity with stories, trinkets and\
  \ photographs from around the world. A journey that you took not just once but twice.\
  \  \n\nWhen you slip out of step, think of today, think of yesterday, remember toes\
  \ in warm sand, mountainsides, faraway islands, incredible creatures and the person\
  \ you turned to to say \u201CCan you see that?\u201D\n\nIn tricky times let the\
  \ warmth of those memories guide you home."
