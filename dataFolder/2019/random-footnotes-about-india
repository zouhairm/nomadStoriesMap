Text: "Day Seven: Udaipur\n1. Udaipur manages to have level roads while being surrounded\
  \ by hills;\n2. We settled in the house of Sanjay. If he had not met us on his motorcycle,\
  \ Leyla, we would never have found his house. This is a man to whom I would entrust\
  \ anything;\n3. Sanjay works nights from 7 pm to 6 am. He plows for ungrateful work\
  \ for $120 a month. His house - two tiny rooms and a small bath without a water\
  \ heater. All furniture - two beds, a table, a couple of chairs, an old TV. He washes\
  \ himself, warming the water in the tub on the gas burner. He has no kitchen, no\
  \ hallway;\n4. He dreamed of Nike sneakers. Had been saving for them for three years.\
  \ Bought. Fake ones for 2500 rupees. He said that he would never afford the originals;\n\
  5. Having slept for four hours, he spent all day with us to show the city. Risking\
  \ of being dismissed, he provided us with a safe return home from the city center\
  \ in the evening;\n6. But damn, guys, this man is so positive, believes in a happy\
  \ future, dreams of going to Russia to his beloved one and studying at St. Petersburg\
  \ University;\n7. Udaipur needs to be \u201Ceaten\u201D by eyes. Photos do not describe\
  \ this beauty. You walk and feel like a princess;\n8. Walking around the lake, you\
  \ think that you are not in India, but in Monaco. Such a non-stereotypical city\
  \ it is;\n9. Explore the city, looking up, not under your feet. Those who look down,\
  \ see the dirt and the poor. Those who look up notice airy, filigree-carved facades;\n\
  Did I say that the people of India do nothing for free? This is true. But if someone\
  \ here considers you a friend, believe me, he will give the last rupee to help you.\
  \ Sanjay was ready to sleep on the roof, so that we fit in spaciously on two beds.\
  \ Our nations have a surprisingly wide soul.\n\nDay Eight: Udaipur\n1. On the packaging\
  \ of many products already fixed price is printed. Moreover, the sellers do not\
  \ even think of raising it [the menacing look in the direction of Russian stores];\n\
  2. Journey made sleep my welcome friend and worst enemy. Today we decided to allow\
  \ ourselves the luxury of having a good night\u2019s sleep and not to disturb Sanjay\
  \ for a long time after work;\n3. In addition to the ubiquitous cows, goats, huge\
  \ monkeys and hogs roam here. The latter are always in unexpected places;\n4. For\
  \ example, in a river;\n5. In Udaipur cheap silver and leather. For the quality\
  \ of jewelry you can vouch, but leather bags are made clumsily by one atrocious\
  \ template. But cheap;\n6. Waiting for the bus, we talked to a guy from London,\
  \ who is a freelance manager in the theater. I was glad to hear the correct English\
  \ language. He had been traveling in India for two months and did not know how long\
  \ he will stay. He said he wanted to go home the first two weeks. Then he just plunged\
  \ into the flow of general calm and started to enjoy the country. I\u2019m jealously\
  \ waiting for my plugetime;\n7. At the bus stop we met a girl with whom we had previously\
  \ chatted in the city twice. Fate, isn't it?\nFarewell to Sanjay was creaking heart.\
  \ He bought us gifts for the last 10 rupees that remained in his wallet - small\
  \ bracelets with the words \"Best friends\" on them. I fed him in the Subway where\
  \ he had never eaten before. Having received a salary, he gave us chocolates for\
  \ the road. But... the main gift is his friendship. See you in St. Petersburg, our\
  \ dear Indian friend and person with the widest soul in Udaipur. We will not forget\
  \ you.\n\n(Remark: I usually post the footnotes with random thoughts appearing in\
  \ my head during journeys. This is my kaleidoscope of what I spot and feel)"
