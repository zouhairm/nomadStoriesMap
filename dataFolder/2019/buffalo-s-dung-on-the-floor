Text: "\u201CI thought people in here don\u2019t use ATM.\u201D Said Sabrina when\
  \ she saw what in front of her; an ATM centre which designed like a Sasak Ethnic\
  \ traditional house, Lombok, with curvy saddle roof form and finished with straw.\
  \ It has four wooden poles, four tempered-glass walls, and a tempered-glass door.\
  \ Such a good combination between contemporary technology and traditional culture.\n\
  \n\u201CI thought we won\u2019t find an Alfamart in here too.\u201D Add Rima when\
  \ she saw a building beside the ATM centre. Alfamart is a mini market company which\
  \ you can find in every few hundred meters in Java Island.\n\n \u201CBut the street\
  \ is completely deserted.\u201D I said while looked to the right and left before\
  \ I crossed the street. \u201CLooks like we could crossing this street and doing\
  \ gymnastics at the same time without fear of being crushed by any vehicle.\u201D\
  \n\nAcross the road, there is the gate of Sade Village, Sasak Ethnic, Lombok. This\
  \ place was our first destination when we arrived at Praya International Airport\u2014\
  which since September 5, 2018, its name changed with name Zainuddin Abdul Madjid\
  \ International Airport (ZAMIA). It took thirty minutes to ride by car from airport\
  \ to reach Sade Village.\n\nSade Village is a cultural village which managed by\
  \ the local government. Every day, Sade Village will welcome the tourists with their\
  \ traditional ceremonies and dances. The sound of gamelan\u2014gamelan is a set\
  \ of Indonesian traditional music instruments\u2014heard by us when we walked into\
  \ the gate. Two women welcomed the tourists in front of the gate and gave us a free\
  \ beautiful Sade\u2019s woven cloth as a gift from Sasak's people.\n\nFirstly, after\
  \ the traditional music began, we were welcomed by two men who played a traditional\
  \ dance named Tarian Gendang Beleq. \"Tarian\" means dance, \"gendang\" means a\
  \ music instrument such a percussion, and \"beleq\" means big in Sasak\u2019s language.\
  \ Its name is accurate because they hit a big \"gendang\" while they danced. Sasak\u2019\
  s people said that this dance was performed in front of their king and used to give\
  \ a spirit to the soldiers when they went to the battlefield several hundred years\
  \ ago.\n\nAfter they welcomed us with Tarian Gendang Beleq, they entertained us\
  \ with a dance called Tarian Paserahan. Tarian Paserahan is a battle between two\
  \ men through a dance with a rattan cane and a shield from cow\u2019s skin called\
  \ \"ende\" for each man and guided by two referee called \"pakembar\". Usually,\
  \ this dance is practiced when two men want the same woman. The way to determine\
  \ who is suitable for the woman is to win this battle.\n\nAfter the welcome ceremony\
  \ was done, we pleased to strolling around the Sade Village. Before I went to there,\
  \ my lecturer in the college said that Sasak\u2019s people have a tradition to mop\
  \ their house\u2019s floor by buffalo\u2019s dung. When we were there, there was\
  \ a house which is just mopped by the buffalo\u2019s dung and it was strange because\
  \ it wasn\u2019t smelly at all. They mopped their house by the buffalo\u2019s dung\
  \ as a treatment for their house\u2014because their floor is earth, they don\u2019\
  t use ceramic tiles\u2014to make it clean. If you asked them why the buffalo\u2019\
  s dung wasn\u2019t smelly at all at their house, most of them couldn\u2019t give\
  \ you a scientific answer. They would only say that it was what their predecessors\
  \ did. But some research said that it is could be because of Lombok\u2019s ground\
  \ condition, its air humidity, and its local climate.\n\nThere are so many other\
  \ interesting things from Lombok\u2019s traditional architecture, interior, and\
  \ their culture which would take tens of paper if I tell you here. So it would be\
  \ good for you if you have a chance to come to Lombok and get the experience by\
  \ yourself. But I must tell you that I visited Lombok before the terrible earthquakes\
  \ shook Lombok. And it always breaks my heart if I remember how beautiful Lombok\
  \ was. \n\nNo. Lombok is still beautiful no matter how terrible the effects of the\
  \ earthquakes, at least for me."
