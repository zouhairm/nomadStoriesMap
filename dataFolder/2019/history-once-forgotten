Text: "Despite claiming to be M\u0101ori, I don\u2019t actually know much about my\
  \ own heritage. I\u2019ll tell you that off the bat. My father, the representative\
  \ of the M\u0101ori half of my dual nationality, spent some time telling me the\
  \ history of our people. I descend from three iwi, or tribes, which are all located\
  \ around Te-Ik\u0101-au-Maui, the North Island, of Aotearoa, otherwise known as\
  \ New Zealand.\n\n\u201CI\u2019m taking you to Taranaki,\u201D my father declared,\
  \ one day before I moved to a new city. Taranaki is a mountain on the West Coast\
  \ of Te-Ik\u0101-au-Maui that sits between H\u0101wera, a quiet, rural town where\
  \ my father and stepmother live, and New Plymouth, a seedling of a city with a population\
  \ of 74,000. Taranaki was the home base for one of my iwi, Ng\u0101 Ruahine. I was\
  \ keen to go. He had taken my sister the previous summer, and he felt it was his\
  \ duty to take both of us to a place that held significance to our ancestors.\n\n\
  We approached the mountain, by car, at the butt-crack of dawn. My father weaved\
  \ an elaborate narrative on our forty-minute drive there. He knew all the territory\
  \ markers for the group of iwi that descend from the Taranaki Region. He pointed\
  \ out my great-grandmother\u2019s former home. He took me to the coast, where he\
  \ had been part of an unsuccessful effort to save nine whales that had beached themselves\
  \ seven months prior.\n\n\u201CThe smell was awful,\u201D he remarked, as he reminisced\
  \ on his whale-saving attempt. \u201CYou had to throw away all your clothes if you\
  \ got even a small part of their blubber on you. It was really sad.\u201D\n\nWe\
  \ arrived at the base of Taranaki while the sun steadily climbed up the sky. He\u2019\
  d advised me to bring my best jacket, and when we stepped out of the car I was thankful\
  \ that he had. The wind had a snap to it, even though it was the height of summer.\n\
  \nWe made our way down to Dawson Falls, or Te Rere o Nok\u0113. We walked through\
  \ a forest of deep green ferns sprouting off broad tree trunks that were so thick,\
  \ the wind only touched the top of the trees. The songs of the t\u016Bi birds followed\
  \ us down the steep wooden stairway, which was decorated with a dilapidated support\
  \ rope.\n\n\u201COur ancestors hid in the forests of Taranaki during the 1860s,\u201D\
  \ my father explained quietly. \u201CThey retreated into the forest because colonists\
  \ had begun to fight them for the land.\u201D\n\n\u201CHow long did they stay here?\u201D\
  \ I asked. \u201CIs this the part of the forest where they lived?\u201D\n\nHe chortled\
  \ quickly. \u201CNo. That was much further into the forest.\u201D A look of solemnity\
  \ fell onto his face. \u201CThey stayed in these forests for ten years. When they\
  \ went back to their land, they found that it had been confiscated and claimed by\
  \ those colonists.\u201D\n\nWe reached Te Rere o Nok\u0113 with the trills of the\
  \ birds accompanying our silence. The water, crystalline and pure, splashed so severely\
  \ against the rocks that you would\u2019ve gotten a mouthful of it if you left your\
  \ jaw wide open. There, he made me participate in my second baptism. My first had\
  \ been a Christian one, orchestrated by my South African mother when she took me\
  \ to Cape Town to meet the other half of my family.\n\nWhat better place to have\
  \ a baptism, really? Mount Taranaki is legendary. Taranaki Region was ranked one\
  \ of the best places to visit in the world by Lonely Planet in 2017. Taranaki is\
  \ actually an active volcano, which hasn\u2019t erupted since the 19th century.\
  \ Its long, rich history deserves the t\u0101pu\u2014the sacredness\u2014it now\
  \ demands its guests to adhere to.\n\nMy father brought back some water to bless\
  \ the car, too. \u201CWe don\u2019t want to carry any spirits home,\u201D he warned.\
  \ As we drove away from Taranaki, I ended up carrying the past with me. People that\
  \ I am distantly related to had lived in nature\u2019s camouflage for a decade,\
  \ two centuries ago, yet here I was moving to a city populated by a million people,\
  \ of all different creeds and nationalities. I wonder what my ancestors would think\
  \ of that?"
