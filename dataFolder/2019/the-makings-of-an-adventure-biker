Text: "I\u2019m sitting here on a rainy afternoon in old Blighty and looking out of\
  \ my window in awe. Slightly older with a darker complexion and a better figure\
  \ than me; my Yamaha FZ6. It\u2019s funny that I own a motorbike really, I\u2019\
  d never even thought about riding. Yet here I am today with my very own two-wheeled\
  \ companion, and one with a pretty decent sized engine for a novice: a 600cc (that\u2019\
  s literally like being pulled by 112 horses!)\n\nLet me take you back to the beginning\u2026\
  \ it was the start of 2016 and I think I was having my millennial quarter life crisis!\
  \ Anything that could have gone wrong, went wrong. I\u2019d had enough of the 9-5\
  \ drag and wanted some excitement in my life. I was consumed by wanderlust. My itchy\
  \ feet were getting the better of me and I knew I wanted to go somewhere completely\
  \ out of my comfort zone. On 16th June 2017, I embarked on my Latin America adventure\
  \ with only my backpack and two legs. Unbeknownst to me, when getting on that plane\
  \ to Mexico it would only be a week into my travels when the real adventure would\
  \ begin!\n\nIt was when I got to Oaxaca that something caught my eye from the hostel\
  \ entrance. A big black shiny steel horse proudly positioned for all to gawp at.\
  \ Little did I know back then that this was a KLR650 aka \u2018The Pig\u2019. I\
  \ already knew that I wanted to hitch a few rides, so being a friendly traveler,\
  \ I swiftly introduced myself to the rider. He was robustly built, curves in all\
  \ the right places, even if a little rough around the edges\u2026 and that was just\
  \ the bike! \nI remember quite vividly the first time I swung my leg over that seat.\
  \ Energy sapped by the jungle heat, I could hear a growl of some sorts in the near\
  \ distance. The vibrations made the hair on the back of my neck stand on end as\
  \ I eyeballed this black hunk of metal glide around the corner. My knight in shining\
  \ armour had arrived. I shakily stepped up onto the back pedal and plonked myself\
  \ down. Hot and sweaty, my arse cheeks were firmly stuck to the leather seat and\
  \ I thought, \u201Cboy, am I in for a ride\u201D. With the wind in my hair and some\
  \ funny looking bugs in my teeth, I felt invincible. The rush I felt through my\
  \ body tantalized my senses. A new exciting lease of life coursed through my veins.\
  \  Everything was racing passed me with speed, yet I was able to take every moment\
  \ in with a sense of fulfillment - I was being drawn in to a whole other world I\
  \ never even knew existed! The only downside to that ride was that it didn\u2019\
  t last long enough, a situation us women find ourselves in way too often!\n\nAfter\
  \ riding pillion for two months, I realised something was missing. My senses were\
  \ challenged but my feeling of belonging was still lost. I was captivated by the\
  \ sensation of the warm breeze brushing my skin. I was hooked on the rush of seeing\
  \ my knee caress the tarmac around every corner. I had a roar in my tummy -which\
  \ could have been the street food I had for lunch - but I think it was something\
  \ more. A moment of madness swept through me and I cluelessly bought my first motorbike.\
  \ After learning emergency stops and falling off a few times, he earned the nickname,\
  \ Bruiser. I rode through six countries and the length of the South American continent\
  \ with Bruiser, clocking up 15,000km. I took on highways, mountain passes and dirt\
  \ roads galore, but it was in Colombia when I realised the colour of adrenaline\
  \ was brown; I\u2019ll leave that story for another time. Needless to say, I broke\
  \ down a few times but there was always a handy local willing to me help me out.\
  \ That\u2019s the beauty of travelling; it restores your faith in humankind that\
  \ may have been lost somewhere along the way in life."
