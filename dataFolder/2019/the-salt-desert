Text: "I finally made it, after planning for a year and half.\nThe white desert \u2013\
  \ Rann of Kutch, is a beauty. Situated in west India, in the great Thar Desert,\
  \ the world\u2019s largest salt marsh welcomed me with an exciting journey and some\
  \ beautiful memories.\nAt 12.05 am, I was at the railway station, apprehensive and\
  \ happy, waiting for the train to arrive, clutching onto my unconfirmed ticket.\
  \ As I joyfully hopped in, there followed an hour long conversation with the ticket\
  \ checker.\n \u201DPlease Sir\u201D\u2026\u2026\n\u201CI am sorry Miss\u201D\u2026\
  \u2026.\nAnd then the old generous man looked convinced with the extra monetary\
  \ offering and with the rising sun, I was at Kutch. The fresh air, felt so happy.\
  \ \nAt 6 am, the salt land was barren and cold and amazing. As far as I could see,\
  \ there were stretches of white terrain, merging into the whiter sky. The golden\
  \ glow of the rising sun had lit up the ground below my feet (I took off my socks\
  \ and sneakers to walk on this part of the earth, to feel the soil). The land sparkled\
  \ as the salt reflected the sunlight and hence the pinkish- gold glow. I sat there,\
  \ admiring.\nPeople clicked photographs in great perception with sun, some walked\
  \ around and some huddled here and there. I sat there sipping the Kutchi Masala\
  \ Tea.\nMy stay was at the Rajwari Bhunga (Tent House) 4 kms from the desert. After\
  \ a lavish local breakfast of the \u201CDhokla\u201D (fluffy rice cakes), \u201C\
  Khandavi\u201D (rolls made out of pulses), \u201CKhakra\u201D(tortillas), \u201C\
  Raita\u201D (curd), I made a visit to the local shops. I had not seen anything so\
  \ colourful for miles as a stretch. There were beautiful embroidered sarees, shoes,\
  \ umbrellas, key chains, scarfs etc for sale and I almost got one each (paid extra\
  \ for my luggage to the airlines). These handicrafts are all hand- made by the local\
  \ men and women, famous for the intricate vibrant designs of mirror work, paintings\
  \ and ornamentation.\nI enjoyed the sunset at the salt desert again. Mesmerized\
  \ to linger around a little longer, I missed my bus back to the tents. The sun set\
  \ and it was dark and no one was seen around. I panicked for there was nothing but\
  \ a glowing land in the moonlit night. I ran a kilometre, only to find a few army\
  \ officers taking back their camels into shelter. And this was it \u2013 I trotted\
  \ on a camel back all along the desert on a full moon night, glad to realise that\
  \ \u201Call things happen for the good\u201D. \nThe chilly night saw an adorable\
  \ cultural event, where little school girls and smiling musicians danced and sang\
  \ to the local music and narrated folk legends. It was a show so cheerful, that\
  \ whenever I look back at it, I never fail to smile.\nI also visited the Kala Dungar\
  \ (Black Hill), a landscape with an enormous magnetic force that made our vehicles\
  \ move even when the engines were not turned on and the Gandhi Village, where the\
  \ residents hand crafted beautiful attires and colourful artefacts and lived a life\
  \ of simplicity and contentment.\nTaking back with me some lovely pictures (I wish\
  \ I could show them on Nat Geo), mouth-watering packaged food from the Kutch, some\
  \ white salt right from the desert itself and memories of the wonderful people I\
  \ met, I sign off.\nI made some friends. A woman who sold to me a scarf, hugged\
  \ me warmly when I left her shop.  A man selling coconut water, narrated some excited\
  \ stories from his life including how his children travel far and wide performing\
  \ folk songs, a little girl gifted me a doll, made out of scrap cloth. She had made\
  \ it herself. \nA few days away from my city and all the busy days, was perfect\
  \ to reflect on some life lessons. My young ambition of becoming an astronaut had\
  \ pictures of the moon to be of a particular sort \u2013 white, gold haze ball,\
  \ pearly with cold, pure air. The Rann was a little time travel into the land of\
  \ hope, dreams and beauty. \nThere is always so much to see and learn all around.\
  \ Happy Travelling.\nCheers!!"
