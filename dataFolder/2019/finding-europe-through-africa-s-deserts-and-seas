Text: My travel story started from my West African country of Nigeria in the year
  1999 when I was just 21 with no legal or financial means to realize my dream of
  migrating through the regular mode of securing a visa and traveling by air to Europe,
  in a bid to escape the economic hardships in my homeland and help bring succor to
  my family by sacrificing myself as a lamb on the alter of setting out to the unknown
  in Europe in search of a better life. Having been disadvantaged by the lack of all
  the requisites to achieve this dream of mine, I had set about achieving it by traveling
  through the deserts and seas of Africa through The Niger Republic, Mali, Algeria,
  Morocco and finally making it into Spain after almost two years of untold suffering
  on this perilous journey. I had been faced with near and actual deaths as I witnessed
  co travelers abandoned and left behind to their fate whenever they show any signs
  of fatigue not to mention the many human skeletal remains we came upon in the course
  of this journey. At some point on this trip, I had been on the receiving end of
  been left behind after taking a short rest from my group and had to find my way
  on my own going further. At some point while alone, it had started raining  heavily
  with no where in sight to take refuge or shelter I had kept on walking until I stumbled
  upon a cemetery. Having been walking for a long time and fatigued I hadn't the strength
  to carry on any further that night so, I simply reached for the closest grave to
  me upon which I laid and slept the night through until the next morning.
