Text: "A crazy bus ride\n\nThe driver rushes over the mountain road in high-speed.\
  \ Sharp curves left and right force me to use both hands to hold on to the iron\
  \ bar in front of me. I squeeze tight in order not to end up in the walkway. Loud\
  \ Sri Lankan pop music pumps in my ears. Usually it\u2019s good to take the front\
  \ seat, to reduce the shaking. But today, no single person in the half-empty bus\
  \ is safe. We shake, break and bend continuously with a speed way faster than desired.\
  \ A quick glance back tells me that even the locals are holding tight now. Then\
  \ you know it\u2019s real! \n\nI\u2019m on my way from Ella to the Diyaluma waterfall.\
  \ With a spectacular drop at 220 meters, Sri Lanka\u2019s second highest waterfall\
  \ is still surprisingly unknown among tourists. Yet, with multiple falls, several\
  \ natural pools and hiking opportunities it\u2019s a paradise for both adventure\
  \ seekers and people looking for a leisurely day out. \n\nDiyaluma waterfall; lower\
  \ falls\n\nCompletely shaken I arrive at the lower falls. At first sight, a rather\
  \ small body of water. Following a slippery, narrow trail over boulders and dirt,\
  \ it\u2019s only a short but intense hike to the base. Standing afoot of the fall,\
  \ the 220 meter drop looks sky-high and tingles my senses. And even though I expect\
  \ the water to be cold, I still feel the urge to plunge into it.\n\nThere\u2019\
  s something utterly exciting about entering a waterfall; the first touch of water\
  \ as the feet enter the natural pool. Followed by soft mist and cold splatter that\
  \ causes  goosebumps on the skin. From the ever-growing sound as you get closer\
  \ to the fall, to the strong force of water when it eventually hits you. \nThe Diyaluma\
  \ waterfall is no exception. While raining down her force on me I laugh and bend\
  \ under her pressure. She blurs my vision, deafens my ears and strikes with every\
  \ consuming drop. I laugh, roar, cry and shiver, until the coldness of her water\
  \ forces me out.  \n\nThe experience that high waterfalls with small water bodies\
  \ can have such an impact on the human body reminds me of the fragility we have\
  \ as human beings. While enjoying her strength and force thoroughly, I\u2019m very\
  \ aware of the ease we are damaged by.\n\nExpedition upper falls; living on the\
  \ edge \n\nLeading along a local village and green paradise-like nature, it\u2019\
  s takes a steep, full hour hike to reach the spectacular drop of the upper falls.\
  \ Along the way, breathtaking sights on small cascades, natural pools and endless\
  \ stretches of jungle-clad mountains appeared one after another. The combination\
  \ between height, water and jungle is both astounding and energizing. \n\nSetting\
  \ foot on the 220 meter steep plateau, I shuffle my way towards the edge. Nerves\
  \ and tension rush through my body as I approach the cliff. Warned about danger\
  \ by an alarmingly present instinctive sensation, my body screams to return to safe\
  \ ground. \u2018It\u2019s better to sit here\u2019 I think to myself. Lowering to\
  \ the ground with utmost caution, I use both hands and feet to continue to the cliff\u2019\
  s edge. The fierce wind in combination with the height and tension, cause a weak\
  \ and shaky feeling. And make me very insecure.\n\n\u2018Just one year ago two French\
  \ tourists died here.\u2019 A local guide shouts casually but dead-serious. \u2018\
  They lost balance and fell of the cliff\u2019 The sound of his words immediately\
  \ return the human fragility to my mind; humans are so fragile and easily damaged.\
  \ Our presence on this planet is only temporary. Being able to enjoy our lives,\
  \ to live them well and in appreciation of what we have is so important. It should\
  \ never be ignored. \n\nOn hands and feet I crawl back to safe ground again. And\
  \ while the tension wears off, I can all of a sudden refocus on the beauty around\
  \ me. Standing up, a new sensation takes over. I still feel the wind blowing. I\
  \ still hear the water flowing. And I still gaze at the seemingly endless depths\
  \ in front of me. But this time, I raise my arms fearlessly. This time I am free."
