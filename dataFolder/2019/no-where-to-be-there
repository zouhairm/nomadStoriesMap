Text: 'took a step into some place. saw a filled with nothing space. created names
  and a hip. left a music and a sip.

  conquered places as someone once did. told them stories others hid. made a child
  laugh with a tear (and the adult cry with fear).

  there were faces, there were traces. stains of a forgotten past. there were dreams,
  there were teams (and the beans not meant to last).

  crowded streets, stars a lot. empty sheets, love was hot. cold were memories left
  behind (but the future, oh, so bright).

  through the almost same old language, an abyss of sane new words. with him came
  some new arrangement of syntax until then, well, supposed.

  drink with me your cheapest wine. bring me cheese and read my lines. from old land
  I wanna hear how a land could disappear.

  are you okay with your own feet? an innocent guy can take a leap? brother I and
  You for sure. make my verse so more secure.

  see, I came to see your face, if I find a place of mine, as I came from where there''s
  nothing that would ease my thirst for line.

  join with me and bring some beauty. I''ll bring some, if you allow. as the home
  is yours, i pray, don''t be blinded for a fall.

  from the distance i can see some new words i still not speak. teach me how and I''ll
  be fine as you''ll be with all my rhymes.'
