Text: "Saudade is one of those words that doesn\u2019t quite have an English translation.\
  \ It rolled rhythmically off the tongues of musicians and lovers during my months\
  \ in Brazil. Each time I thought I understood, I realized I didn\u2019t. Sitting\
  \ on Ipanema beach two nights before my flight back to Toronto, two Brazilian locals\
  \ tried, with slightly slurred words, to explain it to me.\n\n\u201CA deep missing\
  \ for something that is gone from your life\u201D, the first stranger said, setting\
  \ down a half-smoked cigarette. Deep wrinkles accompanied her wide smile, giving\
  \ away a few extra years. \n\n\u201CNostalgia?\u201D I offered.\n\n\u201CNo\u2026\
  no, no. It\u2019s happiness too. It\u2019s much more than that meu amor\u201D. She\
  \ almost said something else, but instead just put the cigarette back in her mouth.\
  \ \n\n\u201CIt means something different for everyone\u201D. The second stranger\
  \ was a young man, his skin glowing a golden olive. \u201CI think of my mother.\
  \ She always said it\u2019s the love that stays with you.\u201D\n\nThe woman gave\
  \ a small nod and asked what I was doing in Rio alone over the holidays. I blinked\
  \ twice and sipped my Antarctica, more invested in his answer than her question.\n\
  \nIt wasn\u2019t the first time I\u2019d been asked why I\u2019m spending the holidays\
  \ away from \u2018home\u2019. The simple answer is \u2018it\u2019s the only time\
  \ I have\u2019. The more complicated one is \u2018I\u2019m still looking for one\u2019\
  .\n\nSome might say there\u2019s irony in looking for home in a place you\u2019\
  ve never been. But the truth is, home has rarely been defined by four walls or familiar\
  \ street names. Having moved continents, countries, and city after city, home always\
  \ had a transient definition. The second I settled I was uprooted again. I had in\
  \ me three languages, contradicting traditions, and all the cultural confusion that\
  \ came with it. After eighteen years of trying to make sense of the movement that\
  \ surrounded my life, I didn\u2019t expect it to be a seven lettered Portuguese\
  \ word that would finally make me understand.  \n\n                            \
  \                                                    ---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\
  \nRio de Janeiro welcomed me with open arms and kisses on cheeks. A tiny hostel\
  \ that sat behind delicate iron gates, exactly three minutes and two right turns\
  \ from Gloria metro station, became \u2018home\u2019 that winter. Working as a bartender\
  \ for the season, I cut limes and muddled mint leaves, making many Caipirinhas,\
  \ and even more friends. \n\nI soon discovered why they call Rio \u2018The Marvellous\
  \ City\u2019.  Palm trees lined wide marble streets that crowded with early rising\
  \ fruit vendors and opened up to kilometers of golden beaches. The scene on Copacabana\
  \ always unfolded the same. Sea birds danced their winding dances and young boys,\
  \ tanned and dewy, ran circles around each other, chasing well-worn leather footballs.\
  \ On days off I sat with new friends, our faces turned upwards, and debated the\
  \ makings of a life well lived to the sound of lapping waves and repinique drums.\
  \ \n\nI met people, each broken, whole, and full of life in their own ways. People\
  \ who came from far away corners of the same small world, and found what I found\
  \ here \u2013 ease, belonging. Rio gave us unexpected dance lessons on the streets\
  \ of Lapa, bikinis that didn\u2019t hide much at all, and the idea that magic did\
  \ not only come from extraordinary things.\n\nI often revisit, in my dreams and\
  \ in my thoughts, that winter in Brazil. I think of all the people who left their\
  \ stories with me. I think of samba and celebration, the way the breeze always carried\
  \ the scent of mango, and saudade \u2013 all the love that remained with me.\n\n\
  My origins are scattered, my roots above ground. But home, I realized that winter,\
  \ did not need a single definition. Home is a cumulation of sorts, of all the places\
  \ that made you feel like you belong."
