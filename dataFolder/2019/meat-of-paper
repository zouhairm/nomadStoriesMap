Text: "Meat of paper\n\nHe took a deep breath, and then he took a deep breath. After\
  \ that, Zafra brought out his tiredness with him since this morning. Another thirty-five\
  \ years old followed him. His bag was lying in front of him with a half-closed zipper.\
  \ Including his trousers jeans; the bag was not as much as he cares to end this\
  \ day, closed his eyes for a moment and we did not recognize him since the arrival\
  \ of a phone call (tomorrow will travel), prepared his bag on a hurry, and fill\
  \ her stomach with pieces of clothing and necessary necessities, He did not tell\
  \ anyone that he would travel in the morning and kept his secret Ever born two months\
  \ ago, she flips in his bed and turns his phone with him from time to time, a strange\
  \ feeling overlies the chest, where the enthusiasm that was possessed when he went\
  \ to the travel desk recording Hamutain eyes? He did not sleep until he heard the\
  \ dawn's ears. He dined and found himself in the mosque for the first time in more\
  \ than 15 years. He returned to his house and waited in a hesitant and fearful way\
  \ for the car to take him away without leaving his brothers or one of their children.\
  \ The passengers left the taxi next to the window. , For a moment imagine that he\
  \ is behind the window of his room, but the streets are moving, houses, trees, electric\
  \ lights, all moving and fixed in place, did not imagine that the road so long,\
  \ he sees Gaza but does not feel it, nor Bahwaiha, or the smell of trees, The sound\
  \ of its people is heard, the position of the car was nothing but a mini-state from\
  \ Gaza Rah aversive, forced, compelled, and they see little life! - All have their\
  \ causes -,\n\"No, no one knows, but one of us will not be as it is now.\" Now he\
  \ is in a hall full of secrets, stories, dreams, and wishes. How many dreams did\
  \ he kill before he arrived? Everyone here?\nHe ran his neck on his left, her little\
  \ son watering water, remembering his mother and the world battles that were going\
  \ on between them to make him eat or drink something while he was old. He ran his\
  \ face on the other side, a girl hugging a book with her hands. The back, adjusted\
  \ from her sanda elbows on his knees and asked her: Where are you going?\nI answered\
  \ him without looking up from the line where you live: for salvation.\n\_Not only\
  \ increased more confusion and curiosity, he asked her: Who?\nThis time she turned\
  \ her eyes to him and answered: From my community.\nShe exchanged her look and said\
  \ to her: Sorry to interfere, but why?\nShe stood and turned her back to him as\
  \ she patted a sheet of paper with a sign in her book. Then she answered him: \"\
  Every place can not separate your wing and fly in it and scream at the top of its\
  \ voice is a prison. I am not a criminal. I only dream of freedom.\nShe left under\
  \ his gaze, and under the voice of the employee of the crossing, repeating a name\
  \ through loudspeakers, something inside him invites him to know the secret of this\
  \ strange girl, put his hand on his forehead, closed his eyes and kept thinking\
  \ in her words \"Salvation .. Society .. Freedom .. Prison ..\" What is the connection\
  \ between all these words?\nIt is also his story, raising his head and then on the\
  \ same voice that the girl stole."
