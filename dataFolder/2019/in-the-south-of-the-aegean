Text: "At 2 p.m I arrived in Santorini alone, when the summer sun was at its utmost.\
  \ The turquoise sea and its thousand mirrors blinded me for a moment. I looked up\
  \ at the gigantic volcanic island and felt smaller and lonelier. Santorini, dormant\
  \ Titan, the island\u2019s body made of multi-layered creases colorful quartz, red,\
  \ citrine, amethyst. A bouquet of white houses speckled the island\u2019s crest.\
  \ I drove up the zigzagged road in a rented black Fiat, terrified by the unknown,\
  \ tamed by my past, led by scarce road signs, and my sense of direction. I found\
  \ Mathios Village hotel in Akrotiri, an archeological site in the island\u2019s\
  \ south. The lava fragments in the facades of most houses remain like ornamental\
  \ scars. The lobby and empty living room, charming and at the same time austere.\
  \ Kostas, the owner did not sell me the expensive caldera tour, but he offered me\
  \ a cheaper one for the next morning, and I paid 35 euros. My room was a humble\
  \ haven with shut wooden blinds against the heartless Aegean sun. I\u2019ve been\
  \ longing for darkness to restore my sleep, and I lay down for a nap that turned\
  \ in a long good sleep. I woke up the next morning with a call from Kostas, reminding\
  \ me of the cheap caldera tour. I got ready in haste. At a quarter past ten, I climbed\
  \ into the small tour van. The coupled up tourists were waiting only for me. Their\
  \ crazed stares were like needles. I said kalimera with a smile, but nobody answered\
  \ back. On our brief way to the port, nobody talked, they whispered, except for\
  \ the driver shouting to the slow four-wheel motorcycles. But in Greek, speaking\
  \ and shouting are intrinsic to their culture\u2019s charm.\nA wooden caique boat\
  \ awaited at the port for the couples, and me. But the crew couldn\u2019t sail because\
  \ one tour guide was late. Out in the sunshine, he sauntered onto the boat. He was\
  \ wearing a white tank, red shorts, light brown boots. I saw his back, the hairs\
  \ in his calves, the drops of fiery water slipping down his neck, and his face.\
  \ And then only light, only the sky and the sea. \nOn our way to the islet Nea Kameni,\
  \ I was staring at him, and he noticed. First, he spoke English, then German into\
  \ the microphone. At the brief stop for swimming, he warned us:\n\u201COnly if you\
  \ are a good swimmer dive in, if not, please don\u2019t. I know these waters better\
  \ than all of you. I\u2019ve seen people drowning, and I had to save them. But today,\
  \ I\u2019m not in the mood of saving any of you.\u201D \nIn silence, the good swimmers\
  \ dove into the glaucous bay and there were no accidents. In a short time, we arrived\
  \ at the caldera. We walked against gale-force winds, bearing the unappeased sunrays,\
  \ we tripped over the volcano stones. The up and down walk around the volcanic crater\
  \ felt like a walk on Mars. I got lost and showed up in the tourist guide\u2019\
  s group while he was talking to them in German; I pretended to understand, but he\
  \ gave me a strange look with his azure eyes. He realized I didn\u2019t understand.\
  \ \nOn our way back from the tour, on the boat, he sat with us and complained about\
  \ being single: \u201CI witness lovely couples every day holding hands and watching\
  \ the beautiful Oia sunset.\u201D\nI got closer in the boat\u2019s crowd, sat in\
  \ front of him, and carelessly stared, swiftly came over him, and asked:\n\u201C\
  Where are you from? Holland?\u201D\n\u201CNo, I am Austrian,\u201D he replied\n\u201C\
  You are from Latin America, that\u2019s for sure. Whereabouts?\u201D\n\u201CI was\
  \ born in Mexico, but I live in the USA.\u201D \n \nWe introduced ourselves and\
  \ I asked him for recommendations on bars. \n\u201CTonight, I\u2019ll be at Atlas\
  \ Bar in Perissa, it\u2019s not fancy, but it\u2019s a nice dive bar, join if you\
  \ fancy a drink.\u201D\n \nWhen I walked off the boat, I saw two anchored boats\
  \ interposed. The high sun caused swirls of heat in the harbor. I heard my name\
  \ from across the harbor. The tourist guide got me a free taxi ride to Mathios Village."
