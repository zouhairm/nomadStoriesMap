Text: "It was time for my first foreign trip. The time was June 2017, probably the\
  \ hottest summer month of the year. Living in Delhi, India, I was used to extreme\
  \ weather, extreme hot or extreme cold. The destination for trip wasn't final, but\
  \ due to delay in my Passport, the options reduced to few amongst which was Dubai.\
  \ It's probably the most unfavorable time to go to Dubai, but still I thoroughly\
  \ enjoyed amidst the hot weather. Afterall, time spent with family is always a good\
  \ time.\nWe also went to Abu Dhabi for a day, roamed in the Ferrari World and saw\
  \ the Sheikh Zayed Mosque. That mosque was something my eyes couldn't believe. Being\
  \ an art lover, it looked to me the epitome of perfection and creativity. We also\
  \ touched the shore of Arabian Sea, that scenery is still imprinted in my mind.\
  \ It was serene. \nIn Dubai, from the Burj Khalifa to the Dhow Cruise, from the\
  \ Jumeirah Beach to the Desert safari, from the King's palace to the richness of\
  \ The Saga World, everything seemed so interesting, so exciting and of course, the\
  \ whole reason I love travelling, is the learning part.\nThe culture, the spirit\
  \ if people, the cleanliness, the richness, everything said out loud for the city.\
  \ \nIndeed, the city of dreams. Indeed, the city of gold.\n\nTo sum up my trip,\
  \ I would say these few lines:\n\"Peeping out of the window,\nOf the Cruise called\
  \ Dhow.\nThe sea with the reflection of the city lights, \nHad the power to cure\
  \ a million plights.\nIn a country still ruled by a king,\nEven the long magnificent\
  \ towers had something beautiful about it to sing. \nThe Burj is not just a tower,\n\
  It is the proof of hardwork and will power.\nEach and every corner of the city was\
  \ peaceful, yet chearful\nEverything gave me a lesson, for that I am grateful.\"\
  \n\n\"The roads so clean,\nThe city so serene.\nFor the little traveller,\nIt was\
  \ a step towards her beautiful dream.\n\nLoads to learn,\nMemories to earn,\nTo\
  \ the bird,\nIt was the blue sky.\n\nWish there were no boundaries,\nOpportunity\
  \ it was, to fight all the fears.\""
