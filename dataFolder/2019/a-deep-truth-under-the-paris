Text: "The center of Paris hides a lot of secrets under its ground. Beneath telecom\
  \ tunnels, sewers and subway there is a 300-km long chain of catacombs. Abandoned\
  \ quarries below the surface is 10 times the size of New York\u2019s Central Park.\
  \ It is illegal and dangerous to wander around stone labyrinth, full of human bones\
  \ that were exhumed since XVIII century from overflown cemeteries. In this unfriendly\
  \ environment Parisians have parties, make art and experience the real freedom.\_\
  \n\nI wanted to discover this part of Paris for a long time. But it was a mission\
  \ hard to accomplish. To explore the limits of the system you need to find a cataphile,\
  \ a person who spends days and nights in the catacombs. There are about 300 of them\
  \ in Paris. But \u2026tsss\u2026 it\u2019s a secret. Cataphiles are known as a loose\
  \ tribe of young Parisians. They believe that the real Paris is hidden 30 meters\
  \ under the ground. In fact, catacombs were here since Paris was founded. Ancient\
  \ Greeks needed a limestone for building the city. The more they took, the deeper\
  \ and wider quarries become. Over the years, the city's foundations become like\
  \ a Swiss cheese with holes. So, it looks like that today. \n\nIn the Middle Ages\
  \ the tunnels have been regularly collapsed under the weight of the city. \nThe\
  \ largest disaster happened in 1774, when a whole street with houses and roads disappeared\
  \ into sinkholes. Ironically, the street called Rue d'Enfer or \u201CHell Street\u201D\
  . \nAfter this incident, Louis XVI founded Inspection of Mines to prevent the city\
  \ from collapsing. This organization have been working beneath the streets since\
  \ then. Today inspectors are the ones who allowed to enter catacombs. It is forbidden\
  \ for anyone else. \n\nBut this fact never stops cataphiles and curious tourists.\
  \ Cataphiles have a secret painstaking map to navigate the quarries, but even them\
  \ get lost. Tourists disappear in the labyrinth much often. Some of them die. You\
  \ just can\u2019t go to the catacombs without a cataphile. But the problem is that\
  \ cataphiles don\u2019t want any strangers on their territory. They believe that\
  \ it is their duty to protect the underground world beneath Parisians streets from\
  \ people like me. But I was lucky to find a person who agreed to walk the dark with\
  \ me. He spends weekends under the ground during the last 10 years. \n\nWe met at\
  \ 6 pm on Saturday near the crowded crossroad in the city center. I had headlamp\
  \ and muddied boots. My guide points at manhole in the sidewalk.  \n\n\u201CWhen\
  \ I\u2019ll say one-two-three, we jump\u201D, he said. \u201CBe quick. If police\
  \ catch you, we\u2019ll done\u201D.\n\nOne by one, we slip into the catacombs. My\
  \ hands are shaking. I try not to think about the abyss under my feet. When we finally\
  \ reached the ground, it was 30 meters deep. We are in the very center of Paris.\
  \ Every step we make is illegal. The water reaching our hips. Backpacks scraping\
  \ against the rock. We walk in silence. The traditional smell of coffee and croissants\
  \ remains in another world. Here I smell paint from graffiti. We make the first\
  \ stop in the chamber with walls covered in murals. \n\n\u201CWelcome to the beach\u201D\
  , says my guide. \n\nThis is the last thing I expect to find in catacombs. They\
  \ call this place \u201Cbeach\u201D because there is a real sand under your feet.\
  \ Cataphiles brought it from the city so they can hang out here. I notice used candles\
  \ and bottles of Baileys. But what surprise me even more is a painting on the wall.\
  \ They made a reproduction of Hokusai's \"Great Wave off Kanagawa\u201D. Art can\
  \ illuminate even the most unfriendly environment. \n\nWe have been\_underground\
  \ for 8 hours. We walked around 20 km. I can\u2019t tell you more about that experience,\
  \ because as they say, what happens in catacombs, stays in catacombs. But no doubt\
  \ it was one of the most unusual journeys I have ever had. Paris will never be the\
  \ same for me again."
