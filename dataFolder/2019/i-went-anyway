Text: "It was month before I had planned to go to Australia to be an au pair, and\
  \ I could barely buy a cup of coffee. \n\nI was hustling as hard as I could to save\
  \ money, which included signing up to be a local nanny on a website. I gave my phone\
  \ number which didn't ring any alarm bells. \n\nI received a text about someone\
  \ who said they were moving to my city. Long story short, there was a faulty cheque\
  \ involved, and it was a scam. \n\nI had never been scammed before. It felt incredulous.\
  \ \n\nWhile explaining I started to cry in front of the bank teller, I felt sick.\
  \ They couldn't do anything? \"\xCF'm supposed to go to Australia!\" I exclaimed,\
  \ losing my cool, and hoping that would make them understand. I hadn't traveled\
  \ in a few years and I needed to. They were apologetic but offered my no more than\
  \ looks that suggested I might have problems far beyond money. \n\nAfter a few days,\
  \ I decided I wasn't going to let a scam stop me from reaching one of my dream destinations.\
  \ \n\nArmed with one more paycheque from my job, I had enough for a ticket and booked\
  \ it. \n\nI decided that this trip was more important than the quality of it. \n\
  \nEven if it meant buying french fries instead of sushi at Narita airport, my stop-over\
  \ to Sydney. Even if it meant sharing hostel accomodations with a few girls my first\
  \ night in Australia. Even if it meant looking at the UGG store and not buying any,\
  \ or browsing the beautiful summery, stylish Australian boutiques and walking away\
  \ with only memories. \n\nAt first not having a lot of money made me feel like I\
  \ couldn't fully afford to take in the experiences either.  I looked around but\
  \ felt trepidation in really being present. How could I interact with the world\
  \ around me without much money? \n\nBut no price can be put on the present moment.\
  \ Like when you see the Sydney Opera House for the first time.  \n\nWhen I sailed\
  \ by on a boat going to Manly Island (where I would eat yet more french fries) I\
  \ could feel the spray of aqua water while gazing at the white, giant sails of that\
  \ monument. I shared that with a boat-load of people around me, no matter how much\
  \ money any of us had. \n\nI realized I could see everything the people around me\
  \ could, even if some seemed so relaxed I figured they must have more money than\
  \ me. \n\nAnd nothing could take away the cheery energy i felt around me of the\
  \ people while on the island, laying on the beach on hot sand that looked more orange\
  \ than white. Or the way the birds cried out in sounds i had never heard before\
  \ (sounding like actual humans screeching), or the taste of fish and chips with\
  \ \"chicken salt,\"a chicken flavored salt, that my brother, who had been to Australia\
  \ before, urged me to try. \n\nBy the time I got into the car, on the passenger's\
  \ seat on the left side, with my new host \"Dad,\" I was starting to feel a bit\
  \ more present, and a new hope..\n\nIt dawned on me I might not be able to do everything\
  \ that i wanted on this trip, eat everything that I wanted , or buy anything I wanted.\
  \ But no matter what, i was there, and that mattered more than anything. \n\nOnce\
  \ at their house, a small one-level in a nice suburb in Bowen, Queensland, Brett,\
  \ my host Dad, I stood on their back porch in the searing afternoon heat. We could\
  \ hear a fervent rustling and the cries of more mysterious birds in tall trees,\
  \ the sounds again so unfamiliar to my Canadian ears. \n\nIn a field next door,\
  \ looking like a dry, abandoned lot, he quietly pointed out a group of almost camouflauged\
  \ wallabees. As we watched, one of them stood up, alert, pausing. \n\n\"He sees\
  \ you, \" Brett said. \n\nJust like that, I was there and even the wallabees knew\
  \ it. \n\n\xCF still remember the motion of that blurry tan figure stealthily speeding\
  \ off into the nearby woods, soaring in giant leaps, just like me."
