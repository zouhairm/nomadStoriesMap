Text: "\u201CUntold Stories\u201D\n\n\nWe approached the island in a speed boat that\
  \ tethered itself to free-standing, bright wooden stairs that were precariously\
  \ planted in the water near the shoreline.  Exiting the boat through the warm, Caribbean\
  \ water, I took in the scene of our home for the next four days.  It was as I had\
  \ expected; a crescent shaped beach, cream colored lounge chairs with umbrellas,\
  \ and a thatch-roofed restaurant.  But what really stole my attention were the people\
  \ working at the eco-resort.  Their smiles were pleasant, but reserved.  Their eyes\
  \ were attentive, but skeptical.  They walked with an ease and a quiet confidence\
  \ that somehow let us know, \u201Cyou are welcome to stay awhile, but this is our\
  \ home.\u201D\n\nThe Rosario Islands form a National Park and are located about\
  \ 60 miles off the coast of Cartagena, Colombia.  We had done our research and knew\
  \ that the weather would be predictably hot, the water warm and blue, and the ceviche\
  \ incredibly fresh.  My husband and I were craving a relaxing, beach vacation\u2026\
  a chance to slow down.  However, despite all of the diligent homework I had done\
  \ to plan our getaway, I was not prepared for the language barrier.\n\n\u201CBuenas\
  \ noches\u201D, Maria stated as she approached our tiny bungalow on our first evening.\
  \  \u201CPodria por favor dejarnos saber que le gustaria para la cena y que hora\
  \ le gusataria comer?\u201D  My heart sank.  I looked to my husband, Tim, for help,\
  \ but he only shrugged and with a smile said, \u201CHere\u2019s your chance to use\
  \ your high school Spanish!\u201D  I looked back at Maria and noticed that she was\
  \ holding a menu.  \u201COh, you\u2019d like to know what we\u2019d like for dinner?\u201D\
  , I articulated very slowly and with gestures, as if we were playing charades. Then\
  \ it was her turn to shrug. \n\nThe next night I was prepared.  I used the \u2018\
  I-translate\u2019 app on my husband\u2019s phone to write down exactly what I would\
  \ need to say in order to communicate dinner plans.  When it was time, the two of\
  \ us approached the young woman that was organizing dinner that night.  I smiled\
  \ at her, pulled out my notes, and stated in an embarrassingly, broken way, \u201C\
  Hola. Mi marido y yo nos gustaria comer a las 7:30 y me gustaria el pescado para\
  \ la cena.  Gracias.\u201D  I looked up, proud of my attempt to speak her language,\
  \ and caught her glance toward my husband.  Tim laughed first and then, as if his\
  \ laughter gave her permission, she began to laugh as well!  The ice had broken.\n\
  \nThe story of my attempt to speak Spanish made its way around to all the workers\
  \ at our small resort.  As each day progressed, I believe they looked forward to\
  \ the time I would pull out my cheater notes, so they could hear my version of their\
  \ language.  However, as poor as I was at Spanish, they seemed to have an appreciation\
  \ for my efforts.  I had demonstrated to them that we cared and respected their\
  \ culture and their home enough to try.  I allowed myself to be the brunt of the\
  \ joke, and was willing to laugh at myself with them.  This laughter was our connection.\
  \ \n\nAs I travel, I have learned the art of humility and patience.  When I am in\
  \ a new environment, I try to observe not just the buildings or beaches, but the\
  \ people as well.  Kindness, humor and respect open the doors to the most unexpected\
  \ and meaningful stories.   My only regret as I was leaving the island was that\
  \ I could not understand more.  Their smiles and laughter were only the beginning.\
  \  What had their lives been like?  Who were their families?  What were their dreams?\
  \  These are the untold stories of our newfound friends."
