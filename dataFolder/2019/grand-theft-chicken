Text: "\"No no no! Not the chicken! Did he take the chicken?!\" I hear Yon screaming\
  \ from the kitchen, precariously situated 1,717 meters up on an uninhabited volcano.\
  \ I quickly stepped out of my newly erected tent and switched on my headlamp to\
  \ see what all the commotion was about. Yon is pacing back and forth with a furrowed\
  \ brow, consulting with his assistant Jero in Balinese as I interrupt with \"what's\
  \ wrong? What happened?\"\n\nI was 3 months into my solo backpacking quest around\
  \ Southeast Asia. I had heard great things about the sunrise hike up Mount Batur,\
  \ and after doing some research, I decided to be a little more adventurous and request\
  \ the less common sunset and sunrise package with camping at the top of the volcano\
  \ for 1 night. The catch being, you must take everything you need along with you\
  \ for the rather steep 2-hour hike up to the top (and back down). My interests were\
  \ largely driven by the fact that the more common sunrise-only route required a\
  \ 3 a.m. start time and I am not a morning person. So, after Yon agreed to take\
  \ me up to the top the following day, we sealed the deal with some Bintangs and\
  \ a shot of Arak - an unforgiving traditional Balinese liquor that will put hair\
  \ on your chest. \n\nHike day arrives and I revel in my leisurely morning, preparing\
  \ my bag for the ascent. We were plagued with heavy rain showers throughout the\
  \ entire morning, so Yon kept pushing back our departure time, from 12 p.m. to 2\
  \ p.m. to 3 p.m. He had already prepared our tents, food, water, and hiking sticks\
  \ before ordering his assistant Jero to retrieve rain ponchos for the inevitable\
  \ necessity of us beginning the hike - rain or shine. I was promised a sunset and\
  \ a sunrise, and by god, I was going to get it. Because of our rain delays, Yon\
  \ made the executive decision to travel up the mountain by dirt bike. \"Score!\"\
  \ I thought to myself, naively. What seemed like the fast (and lazy) track to paradise\
  \ quickly became an anxiety-filled, heart-racing Grand Theft Auto scene unlike anything\
  \ I've ever experienced. It took all of 2 minutes to graduate from a modest grip\
  \ on Yon's shoulders to a full-on wrap around Yon's torso with my arms. Jero followed\
  \ closely behind us with the entire campsite hanging off his body. The path was\
  \ extremely treacherous, with Yon occasionally letting out sighs of relief each\
  \ time we would prevail from a narrow, muddy stretch with wavering bike tires. My\
  \ eyes were sealed shut 50% of the time, putting my faith in this Balinese man I\
  \ had known all of 18 hours. Alas, we stopped 600 meters short from the campsite\
  \ where I was informed that the rest of the path was only doable by foot. I could\
  \ tell Yon was just as relieved as I was to have made it this far because he gave\
  \ me a big hug and a loud \"whew!\" as soon as our feet touched the ground. From\
  \ there we finished the ascent in the drizzling rain with a slight scramble at the\
  \ end. \n\nWe reached the peak of Mount Batur just as dusk was settling in. Yon\
  \ and Jero immediately started unpacking their bags while I laid out my tent and\
  \ attempted to erect it. We were welcomed by some stray dogs, which Yon advised\
  \ not to pet. I asked who they belonged to, and he replied \"the mountain.\" Yon\
  \ laughed as I tousled around with my tent and quickly took the reins before the\
  \ sun disappeared. I felt so spoiled - not only did I dodge the early morning wake-up\
  \ call, I took the fast-track up the volcano and got there in time to see a stunning\
  \ sunset. Just as I started to really take in the views, I heard Yon yelling \"\
  THE CHICKEN?! NO NOT THE CHICKEN!!\" Turns out, the mountain dogs got spoiled that\
  \ day too and made out with the entire chicken that Yon had brought for dinner.\
  \ We had a lovely vegetarian meal that night, and I laughed for hours with my 2\
  \ new friends, 1,717 meters above the rest of civilization."
