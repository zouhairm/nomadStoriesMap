Text: "This is the story when I went to Malaysia. Before I told about my trip, I will\
  \ tell in advance about the place where I was born and raised that is Aceh. Aceh,\
  \ one of thirty four provinces in Indonesia. Located on the western tip of Indonesia,\
  \ besides being known for its delicious coffee, Aceh also has several important\
  \ events that will be remembered by Aceh people, including: conflict occurring between\
  \ Aceh and Indonesia. this incident originated from Indonesia government who did\
  \ not care about Aceh, therefore a free Acehnese movement was formed the aim is\
  \ to urge the Indonesian government to release Aceh from the Unitary State of the\
  \ Republic Indonesia. In this incident there were many shooting incidents which\
  \ scared the Achenese people out at night and traveled alone. But,it will still\
  \ be a dark story for aceh. In addition to the other events that will not be forgotten,\
  \ namely when the earthquake and waves the tsunami hit the earth of aceh. Which\
  \ at the time many people did not realize the coming of it until finally many victim\
  \ of this disaster incident, nearly hundreds of thousand of Acehnese people became\
  \ the victim of this incident. However, from this disaster the economy in aceh began\
  \ to stabilize and could even a pilot province, because of the economy and its rapid\
  \ development, many magnificent buildings were built that would change the appearance\
  \ of the city of Aceh. That was the incident of a brief that I told you about my\
  \ province.\n\nNow, I will tell you about my best experience when I visiting neighboring\
  \ countries Malaysia. In this my story, I will share my experience of visiting an\
  \ Internasional Islamic Universty of Malaysia ( IIUM ). The university has vamous\
  \ excelent faculties and even the students themselves come from almost all over\
  \ the world. Not only that, I also had the opportunity to meet one of the alumni\
  \ from my school who was taking a S2 at the university. Besides being able to meet\
  \ one of the alumni from my school, I also had the opportunity to have Friday prayers\
  \ at the university's mosque and of course I also got new experience, namely being\
  \ able to listen to sermons from English in the mosque. My next experience was that\
  \ I could have the opportunity to see the highest twin towers in the world in Kuala\
  \ Lumpur, Malaysia. there I saw the beauty of the tower which was filled with beautiful\
  \ lights at night while being able to watch the fountain show dancing to the rhythm\
  \ of the music and also the beautiful lights. besides I went to the twin towers\
  \ and universities, I also had the opportunity to visit the Malaysian palace and\
  \ genting highland. in Malaysia, I can see the cultural diversity that is unique\
  \ between Malay culture and Chinese culture. I see the closeness that is very bound\
  \ between the two cultures. really love cultural diversity, because with cultural\
  \ diversity, we can see every happy person there is nothing hostile between one\
  \ religion and another. \n\nthat's the story of my experience when I visited neighboring\
  \ Malaysia, in this life we \u200B\u200Bshould not be in the same place until the\
  \ end of our lives. we must move to see the outside world because actually seeing\
  \ the outside world is one way we can run the day with a big dream  that will await.\
  \ \nI have big dreams to change the world for the better. There is no battle, there\
  \ is only peace everywhere. so, I have a message for all young people in the world,\
  \ namely: O youth attach your security belt, because you will face all the trials\
  \ that will suddenly come over, and I also have motivational words, namely: If you\
  \ can't fly then run, today we will survive. If you can't run then walk, today we\
  \ will survive. If you can't walk then crawl. But whatever you do, you have to keep\
  \ moving forward."
