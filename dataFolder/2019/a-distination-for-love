Text: "I was 21 years old when I first meet in person my long distance friend who\
  \ surprised me for his visit in the Philippines last March 06, 2012. He is from\
  \ Lyon France, and I was born and raised in the Philippines. First, I met him online\
  \ when I was in my sophomore college days. I videocall with him most of the time\
  \ after my nursing class, but he never see me on the camera because I don\u2019\
  t have my own computer at that time. I got to see him, and the only thing for him\
  \ to be able to see me is through my pictures and he never complains, instead he\
  \ was eager to know me better and deeper. We never have this kind of relationship\
  \ that you may call lovers, but we felt the love for each other as a very good friend.\
  \ I thought it will stay like that, until I graduated. While I was waiting for my\
  \ board exam result for nursing, I travelled from one city to another, and I was\
  \ surprised that he keeps in touch with me along the way. Once the result was posted\
  \ online, and found out that I passed, I moved back to my hometown to start my career\
  \ as a Nurse. One night, when I was having a dinner outside with mu family he sent\
  \ me a message on Facebook, telling me that he is ready to meet me in person and\
  \ that he travelled to Philippines to finally meet me. I was scared at first because\
  \ I only knew him online. But then I realised, he is a good friend of mine and for\
  \ him to travel to Philippines just to meet me is something special. So, I agreed\
  \ to meet him in person. He asked me to choose one place where we can meet and know\
  \ each other in person as a friend. And so I chosen one remote island in Bantayan,\
  \ Cebu. When The airplane landed to Cebu, I was so nervous at that time, I walked\
  \ slowly outside and then I saw him sitting on the couch, holding his phone telling\
  \ me that it\u2019s him which is very obvious to me that it was him, instead of\
  \ approaching him, I actually walk through the exit, he left his bags and followed\
  \ me. He introduced himself to me and kissed me on my forehead and he hugged me\
  \ so tight whispering to my ears how happy he was to finally see me in person. I\
  \ was speechless at that time because I wasn\u2019t expecting him to feel that to\
  \ me. Maybe I did something to him he never expect me to do or maybe we were just\
  \ distined to meet each other. We headed to the island I chosen, and we got the\
  \ chance to know each other more deeply as a friends. Without knowing that in that\
  \ destination, we were able to feel how special we are for each other. We were so\
  \ happy and was having so much of fun together, riding a motorcycle and visiting\
  \ all the places accross the islands. One night before we left the island, I gave\
  \ him a souvenir, a journal that I made during our times together with my pictures\
  \ on it. He opened and reads the journal, and his tears started to fall. He hugged\
  \ me so tight and asks me, what he ever done to him for him to deserves that journals.\
  \ I basically wrote there what we were doing, and what lessons I acquired from those\
  \ moments. He told me that, he already fell in love with me. And tolds me the difference\
  \ between loving someone and falling in love with someone. He said, I was special\
  \ to him. I feel the same way for him. Until now, we still keep in touch with each\
  \  other even if he is in france and I am in saudi working as a Nurse. I am looking\
  \ forward to meet him this year during my vacation on September. Our first encounter\
  \ was truly a destination of love. And love moves in mysterious way."
