Text: "Turtle Don came into my life and showed me how to grow old. And then, he walked\
  \ away very slowly.\n\nThe day I met Turtle Don, I had poked my head out of my tent\
  \ to find that it was a beautiful, crisp, and sunny morning in the Cascade Mountains,\
  \ a dramatic contrast to the day before, where we had trudged along in a ping pong\
  \ ball, socked in by clouds and rain from dawn to dusk. My friends and I, inspired\
  \ by the change in weather, shot out of our campsite, excited to reach the highest\
  \ point on the Pacific Crest Trail in Washington. We scurried along the squishy\
  \ path, still moist from rain the day before, that would lead to astounding views\
  \ of both Mt. Reiner and Mt. Adams. We moved quickly, excited to get to the high\
  \ point, and only stopping to take funny pictures with our friend's new selfie stick.\
  \ \n\nAfter an hour or so of hiking, we all gathered for lunch at the edge of a\
  \ snowy alpine field. We were sitting and chatting about the glory of the day, when\
  \ my friend Melissa, said, \"Hey, guys, look over there! Check out that dude.\"\
  \ We all turned to see an older gentleman slowly and cautiously making his way across\
  \ the snow field with a giant backpack toddling on his shoulders. He had a gentle\
  \ gait, and although he was moving at a glacial pace, he was steady and did not\
  \ seem to be nervous about commuting on snow. \n\nEventually, after what seemed\
  \ like 45 minutes, he arrived at our lunch spot.\n\n\"Hello!\" We chimed at him.\n\
  \n\"Hello, there,\" He responded amiably. \n\n\"Would you like to join us for lunch?\"\
  \ I asked, eager to see what a man his age could possibly be doing on the PCT. If\
  \ I had to guess, I would have said that he looked like he was eighty years old.\
  \ \n\n\"Well, that sounds delightful.\" He sat down on a boulder next to us. \"\
  My name is Turtle Don.\"\n\nMy ears perked up. \"Turtle Don? Where did you get that\
  \ name from?\"\n\n\"Well...\" And then, Turtle Don proceeded to tell us his story.\n\
  \nIn his late 70's, Turtle Don decided to begin doing sections of the PCT after\
  \ having finished the Appalachian Trail. His goal was to complete the trail, and\
  \ to be the oldest person to do so. He made his way slowly along the route, earning\
  \ him the trail name \"Turtle\" to pair with his real name, Don. After years of\
  \ hiking for week long stints, he finally made it to Washington, the last leg of\
  \ the journey. He was thrilled to finally finish his lifelong dream.\n\nThen, his\
  \ wife became terminally ill with cancer. Turtle Don retired from the PCT so that\
  \ he could spend every second with her during her last days on this earth. The year\
  \ she passed away was the same year I met him, and the same year he took to the\
  \ trail again, dedicating each footstep to her name. He was 82 years old at the\
  \ time.\n\nAfter relaying his tale over shared sandwiches, Turtle Don said his goodbyes\
  \ and steadily walked away from us. We all watched him leave in revered silence.\
  \ Even though we were all young, overly confident, and probably a little self-obsessed,\
  \ Turtle Don took our college-age bodies and brains outside of ourselves for that\
  \ moment. We recognized him as a master of life. When asked if he had any advice\
  \ for us, he had left us with parting words that I will always live by: \"Just do\
  \ it, and keep on doing it.\"\n\nWhen I first fell in love with backpacking, I was\
  \ so focused on the destination. I loved reaching the summit and looking around\
  \ at the majesty before me. These days, I am less focused on the end point, and\
  \ find joy in the journey itself. Now, I walk a little slower, with an intentional\
  \ gait and a turtle on my mind."
