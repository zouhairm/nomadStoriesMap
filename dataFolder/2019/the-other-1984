Text: "1984\u2013the year Sarajevo hosted the Olympics. I know Sarajevo and the Olympics\
  \ probably isn't the first thing you think about when you hear 1984, but that's\
  \ where I go. \n \nIt was 2014 when I started a new job, struggling to fit in. I\
  \ heard about a volunteer opportunity to help stem the economic repercussions of\
  \ Bosnia\u2019s debilitating civil war and quickly signed up, with the hope of turning\
  \ my day job into something more. We worked remotely with a local foundation for\
  \ months, building solutions hand-in-hand prior to traveling to Bosnia. Through\
  \ conference calls and emails, I began to get to know the people, especially my\
  \ counterpart Gena, who always had a smile on her face and a story about her dog\
  \ to tell. \n\nWe spent ten days traversing the country, starting in Fo\u010Da,\
  \ a small town near the Serbian border. Bright blue rivers dotted the landscape,\
  \ encompassed by towering green hills. It was serenely beautiful\u2013or so it seemed\
  \ until we went rafting to \"celebrate\" our kickoff. Our guide, a reserved local\
  \ male, casually remarked that the river we were drifting down was red during the\
  \ war, discolored by the blood from the bodies thrown into it. I knew the area was\
  \ taken over by the military, but not of an ethnic cleansing campaign. The juxtaposition\
  \ was jarring and unfathomable.\n \nWe continued to Mostar where we encountered\
  \ Stari Most, a centuries-old Ottoman bridge. It dominated the landscape, framing\
  \ a picturesque village dotted with pink houses. A fisherman scaled ladders propped\
  \ against towering rocky cliffs. We were regaled with tales of yore, stories of\
  \ young men diving from the bridge into the freezing waters when they came of age.\
  \ We then learned the majestic bridge we were admiring was not the original, built\
  \ in 1557 by Suleiman the Magnificent. It had been destroyed in 1993, mired in controversy\
  \ as many suppose it was obliterated for religious reasons unrelated to military\
  \ strategy.\n \nFrom Mostar, we traveled to what appeared to be forgotten farmland\
  \ in Sarajevo. Dandelions and purple wildflowers dotted the fields underneath the\
  \ puffy white clouds. I was jolted from the idyllic landscape with the story of\
  \ the Siege of Sarajevo, the longest siege in modern warfare. My eyes were directed\
  \ toward the concrete foundations littered with bullet holes and a lone boarded-up\
  \ house that masked a hidden secret. Ducking low, we stumbled into a tunnel, dug\
  \ by hand for twenty-four hours a day, used to transport needed supplies into the\
  \ war zone\u2013and smuggle desperate families out. It came to be known as the Tunnel\
  \ of Hope.   \n  \nBy day, we talked business and visited landmarks; by night, we\
  \ circled bonfires drinking rakia, a traditional Balkan spirit, hearing stories\
  \ of life and war and life beyond the war. There was something about those nights\
  \ that transcended work and history. To hear such intense, personal stories from\
  \ the Bosnians I knew only a few months conveyed a trust that to me felt unwarranted;\
  \ that we were spending our time trying to help their country was enough for many.\
  \  \n \nI heard my final story in the mountains of Jahorina, the women's alpine\
  \ skiing site in the 1984 Olympics. Nobody thought a little town in Yugoslavia could\
  \ host the Olympics. In fact, it couldn't: the economy was collapsing, and the city\
  \ needed donations from private citizens to make it happen. Despite their struggles,\
  \ locals gave what they could because hosting was a source of international pride.\
  \ Those who donated enough were rewarded with a rough, palm-sized medal, bearing\
  \ the inscription \u201CSarajevo84\u201D. \n\nIt was rare to have one. Gena had\
  \ two. \n\nAs a thank you for the time we spent working together, she gave me one.\
  \ It's impossible to say what that meant to her, but I know what it means to me.\
  \ \n\nIt is a symbol of the people I met, a symbol of hope and resurgence and pride.\
  \ They fully embraced me, a stranger; they showed me their world. They didn't want\
  \ to be right about the war; they didn't want revenge. They just wanted to learn\
  \ from each other and the past and to share their stories so that others might understand."
