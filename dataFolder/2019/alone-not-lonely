Text: "Alone not lonely!\n\nIn long bygone days\u2019, before smartphones and unlimited\
  \ data, I was holidaying alone in the ever fascinating Paris. Well, technically\
  \ \u2018alone\u2019 was an exaggeration as I was visiting a friend but this, for\
  \ me, was high adventure. As the highly cloistered baby of the family, (with a protective\
  \ dragon for an older sister), I had never really needed to confidently navigate\
  \ the real world by myself. My inherent reticence meant I was neither adventurous,\
  \ nor exceptionally brave. And having always been chaperoned made me awkward, apprehensive\
  \ and rather timid amongst strangers. And here I was now, half a world away from\
  \ India and my comfort-zone. \n\nDay two in Paris I had planned to tag along with\
  \ Vijay, to wait at his university library while he finished his exams, so that\
  \ we could go see the Eiffel Tower. We were running to catch the metro when, in\
  \ typical Hollywood fashion, he got onto the packed train with my backpack just\
  \ as the door slid shut and I got left behind on the platform. Panicked, I managed\
  \ to muster a watery smile and a half-hearted wave through the glass pane of the\
  \ departing train to let him go on to his exam. All I was left with was my rudimentary\
  \ cell phone, the metro day pass and some loose change in my pocket \u2013 in an\
  \ unknown city, at an unacquainted metro station, amidst an unfamiliar language\
  \ with over 4 hours to kill.\n\nThe next train brought me to Cardinal Lemoine which\
  \ according to the metro map led to the Pantheon. But once outside, the narrow,\
  \ dusty, winding lanes and lack of signage had me lost within minutes and I found\
  \ myself looping back in circles. I had no map for reference, phone GPS was not\
  \ yet a thing and my timid appeals for directions went unheeded by the French who\
  \ typically disregard all conversations in English. I cursed the language or rather\
  \ my lack of it, the unfriendliness of the people and regretted my decision to travel\
  \ at all. However, I refused to give up and return. An eon of fruitless meandering\
  \ later, bitterly cold, bone tired and nearly in tears I chanced upon a bus stop\
  \ with a large printed map with directions- Victory! \n\nMuch later, as I made my\
  \ way to meet Vijay, the appealing aroma from a cr\xEApery and a gnawing hunger\
  \ stopped me in my tracks. A warm cr\xEApe sounded just perfect in the sharp November\
  \ chill, but I calculated that my few coins would not nearly be enough. I sadly\
  \ shook my head at the inquiring chef and mimed my lack of adequate money and would\
  \ have walked away had he not stopped me with a compassionate hand on my arm. He\
  \ took the few coins from my hand and made me a decadent egg and ham cr\xEApe oozing\
  \ with a mountain of melty cheese, the taste of which I have yet to forget or replicate.\
  \ This experience changed something within me, I realized that the world wasn\u2019\
  t so alien or terrifying after-all; with some perseverance from me, a little courage\
  \ and occasionally a teensy bit of kindness from strangers I could handle anything.\
  \ \n\nIn the following two months I learnt to appreciate and admire the refined\
  \ elegance, passionate sensuality, restrained flamboyance, romantic sentimentality\
  \ and subtle snobbery of the grand old dame that is Paris. I climbed Montmartre\u2019\
  s 300 steps up-to Sacr\xE9-C\u0153ur Basilica and 669 steps up the Eiffel Tower;\
  \ on streets of Pigalle, outside Moulin Rouge, I got propositioned by a smiling\
  \ Frenchman; I paid my respects at Notre-Dame and gaped in awe of the Masters\u2019\
  \ at Louvre and Musee d\u2019Orsay; I ate luscious salmon rillettes at quaint caf\xE9\
  s and crunchy baguettes sandwiches on banks of the Seine. Best of all, I did it\
  \ all by myself. Alone, yet never lonely!       \n\nTravelling alone terrified me,\
  \ it exhilarated me, it overwhelmed me, it inspired me - the one thing it did not\
  \ do is let me slip back into being a bashful wallflower ever again. Lost, on that\
  \ first day, in winding Parisian lanes, with neither a friend, nor funds or French\
  \ to depend on I found what I didn\u2019t expect to find \u2013 ME!"
