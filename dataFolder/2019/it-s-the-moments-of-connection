Text: "I remember the time I was exploring the Bassah Cave and Church in the village\
  \ of Iraq al-amir, Jordan. A taxi dropped me off in the middle of this small village.\
  \ He passed his number on to me, to call him when I was ready to leave. After I\
  \ had explored, I sat down on the church steps overlooking the never ending mountains.\
  \ I got my phone out to call the taxi driver, only to realise there was no reception\
  \ at all. \n\nI had only been in the country two days, I was 19 and had no Arabic\
  \ skills. I started to walk in the direction that we came from, in hope that I\u2019\
  d gain reception. As luck would have it, after 15 minutes of walking a taxi driving\
  \ in the opposite direction stopped. I didn\u2019t know Arabic and he didn\u2019\
  t speak English. All I could get across was that I needed to get to Amman, 20km\
  \ from here. He motions for me to get into the taxi, proceeding to drive in the\
  \ opposite direction. I\u2019m confused, but hey, what could I do? This was the\
  \ only car I\u2019d seen in 15 minutes, so I got in. A few minutes later he pulls\
  \ up at a service\xE9  (bus) exchange. He tries to tell me that the service\xE9\
  \ will cost 3 Dinar but I think he\u2019s telling me the cost of the taxi. I go\
  \ to hand him 3 Dinar. He refuses, pointing to the service\xE9. I tried to give\
  \ him money. But he refused. I say shukran, one of the only words I knew. \n\nIt\
  \ was a beautiful cave and church. The views surrounding it were stunning. The weather\
  \ perfect, a sunny, cool spring day, a few white clouds in the sky, and a light\
  \ breeze swaying through the branches of the olive trees. However, for me it wasn\u2019\
  t the beauty of the place which has imprinted this happy memory in my mind. It was\
  \ the uncertainty and complete trust I put into the unknown. It was being picked\
  \ up by a taxi driver, giving me a free ride to where I needed to go, and despite\
  \ my lack of ability to speak the local language, he still provided me with warm,\
  \ generous hospitality. \n\nIt\u2019s these moments in my travels which I treasure\
  \ and hold onto. It\u2019s these moments that inspire me to show the same hospitality\
  \ to others no matter where I may be. It\u2019s these moments that remind me the\
  \ importance of patience when communicating across languages. \n\nIt\u2019s the\
  \ joke I shared with a young boy, years later when I could speak Arabic, as I walked\
  \ the busy streets of Cairo. It\u2019s the conversation I shared with a young adult\
  \ in Penang as he assisted me in navigating the local transport. It\u2019s the warm\
  \ smile I received from a mother on an overnight bus from Colombo to Jaffna, assuring\
  \ me that I was safe. \n\nIt\u2019s these small interactions that fuel my desire\
  \ to see more of this beautiful world."
