Text: "The slow setting sun hovered just barely above the horizon, still producing\
  \ enough energy to keep me breathless and sweating. I had a heavy pack on my back\
  \ full of camping gear, clothes and toiletries. The dusty pathway ahead bore no\
  \ end in sight. There was only a balloon carefully placed high above in a tree to\
  \ lead me to the approximate campsite. Go past the pointy trees and sticks, keep\
  \ going further, beyond the LED string lights \u2013 once you see the green flashlight\
  \ hanging from the tree, you\u2019ll know you\u2019ve made it home \u2013 unless\
  \ somebody else also has a green flashlight hanging from the tree, then keep going\
  \ until it you stumble upon your site and thank the heavens. By day 2 I gave up\
  \ on the campsite and slept in a hammock at the other end of the festival. \n\n\
  The simple pleasures were the lake, cold water mist on your face sprayed from friendly\
  \ festival goers, that one pizza stand, and the unforgettable baguette stand next\
  \ to the spaghetti stand. They didn\u2019t need special names. When you\u2019ve\
  \ wandered all day in the heat and your appetite comes back to life after sundown,\
  \ all you need to know is what you want to eat. Baguette, spaghetti, pizza, or something\
  \ vegan \u2013 it\u2019s as simple as that. \n\nIt was only four hours earlier from\
  \ the breathless voyage that a group of us congregated at the airport to board the\
  \ bus from Lisbon to Boom Festival in Idanha-a-Nova, Portugal. My idea of a vacation\
  \ always involved a beach and cocktails, yet they always came down to treacherous\
  \ treks and sleeps on mattresses used up by hundreds of hostel-goers before me.\
  \ This trip, however, took me far out of my comfort zone. \n\nI was not accustomed\
  \ to the notion of \u2018fending for yourself.\u2019 To be perfectly honest, I live\
  \ a comfortable life. Spending 10 days at a music festival in the middle of a scorching\
  \ Portugal desert meant I no longer had my car, food delivery or Uber \u2013 the\
  \ pleasures that make life seem bearable. To put it bluntly, I lived a spoiled life\
  \ in a big city where I made myself believe I needed certain luxuries to be happy.\
  \ At Boom Festival, I didn\u2019t even have the luxury of walking to the kitchen\
  \ to fill a glass with water. I now had to walk 10 minutes to a water station and\
  \ make sure I had enough to last me through to the next water station. After Boom\
  \ Festival, I now consider a shower and a toilet that are less than a 10 minute\
  \ walk away to be a luxury. \n\nI spent my first night crying that I was condemned\
  \ to port-a-potties. Everything seemed dirty, raw. By day 10, I was the one who\
  \ was dirty, raw, uninhibited - and it felt rejuvenating. I had only showered once.\
  \ I even found a tiny bug that had nested in my hair, which had since been braided\
  \ and become knotted. I felt and saw the thin coating of desert dust on my skin.\
  \ I no longer cared about being clean. The lake proved to be enough to wash away\
  \ anything unnecessary. However, I will admit the cathartic post-festival shower\
  \ was and eye-opening experience - it showed me I was not as tanned as I thought.\
  \ The water ran brown in the drain. \n\nLiving in a big city, my guard is up. I\
  \ am always in a hurry. Even my leisure time is premeditated and hurried. I\u2019\
  m constantly trying to reach the next destination, fill my  calendar with next week\u2019\
  s plans. It\u2019s hard to disconnect from the world unless I\u2019m physically\
  \ forced out of it. I needed to let my guard down and accept the beauty of being\
  \ in an unknown place and making do with what I have. This trip not only ripped\
  \ me from my comfort zone but taught me that I need very few things in life to truly\
  \ make me happy. What I thought were luxuries in life were only things that filled\
  \ the void that was boredom."
