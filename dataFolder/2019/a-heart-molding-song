Text: "It was one of those no so warm summer nights. The days behind the steering\
  \ wheel had been magical; the fields, the wild winds, the water springs were always\
  \ unexpected surprises. With the last days ahead, we enter to the capital.\nAfter\
  \ hours walking and endless historical information, some friends and I enter to\
  \ a well known bar in Dublin. We sat in front of a tiny stage, as any other tourist\
  \ we didn't have the intention of losing any minute of the promised 24 hrs nonstop\
  \ music. After sitting, each of my companions began to disappear; my sister took\
  \ the charge of going for the pints, one friend had to go to the bathroom and another\
  \ took some time out and went to light a cigarette. Suddenly, i was all alone in\
  \ the table. I began to look around to see all the new faces, the walls covered\
  \ by random things, the tables and their vintage ornaments. And before I started\
  \ feeling lonely, one man and a guitar sat in a wooden chair in the stage. Had to\
  \ admit, i was a little disappointed to see the guitar. It wasn\xB4t the most traditional\
  \ instrument he could have chosen, but music is music, I thought. He was getting\
  \ ready while the atmosphere got crowded with more tourists like me. The music started,\
  \ he played without missing a tune and although it was the same traditional music\
  \ I had heard, danced and enjoyed days before, I could not really recognize it.\
  \ He sang with his face down, the guitar pressed to his chest, but I could not take\
  \ away the sadness that he made me feel. I didn't understand why. There we were,\
  \ in the most lively place in all Dublin,  without a care in the world, but every\
  \ time he raised his head, happiness left his semblance. \nI remembered meeting\
  \ a singer up in the north of Ireland, who played the same song with so much energy\
  \ and passion. After a long day of work before going home, singing in a small towne\
  \ tavern surrounded by all of his neighbors and friends. One could almost smell\
  \ where they were all day, not gorse fields by the way. But one could also know\
  \ where they all were in that moment\u2026 with family. \nMy thoughts when away\
  \ and I looked around me again. Trying to see what he was seeing, what was the difference\
  \ between those two musicians. The bar was filled with more people than before,\
  \ everyone laughing and drinking. And then it all became clear, he did not felt\
  \ home. He was surrounded by strangers, that did not understand his passion. His\
  \ country\u2019s songs didn\u2019t echo in the hearts of the folk, the empty response\
  \ of a ra\xEDces high Guinness didn\u2019t fill his soul. The songs that tell the\
  \ tales of their struggle and courage had no meaning there. It broke my heart. The\
  \ Why of traveling is not to mold or way through a culture or place, but to let\
  \ it mold us in every step we take. Is in the trying to learn something we ignored\
  \ before. That day I learn to never ignore all those songs that can mold our souls,\
  \ even if they are not in our language. They always come from a place we can all\
  \ understand, the same place."
