Text: "I'd always wonder why someone ever created the phrase \"window of hope\". When\
  \ I looked outside my bedroom window, I'd see the sun shining, the rain droplets\
  \ hitting the glass, snow forming sheets on the ground or leaves cluttering into\
  \ beautiful colorful piles. I'd see that a day always came after a night. I'd see\
  \ that people still went to work even if they wanted to stay in and sleep all day.\
  \ \nWhen I looked out of my car window, on long drive days, I'd see everything pass\
  \ by so quickly. I'd see things leaving my sight as fast as they came, but things\
  \ never stopped coming in front of me. There would always be a couple of things\
  \ that caught my sight, that would make me want to turn around and look at them\
  \ as long as I could. No matter how many windows I looked out of, my perspective\
  \ never changed. There was always something to look at through the window. it was\
  \ never nothing. \nMaybe for some people a blue curtain is just a blue curtain,\
  \ but for me a window somehow represented my life. \nPeople come and go, the memories\
  \ will be never ending, and there will be some moments you will want to hold onto\
  \ longer than others. But life keeps changing, exactly like the view outside every\
  \ window. \n- Shreya Kouda"
