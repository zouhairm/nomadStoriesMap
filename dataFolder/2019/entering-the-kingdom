Text: "The day has come. After two connecting flights and my delayed-overnight final\
  \ flight, it was time to venture to a land I had for years only dreamt about. \n\
  A smiling land. Elephants. Buddhas. Temples. Papayas. Coconuts. Remote islands and\
  \ cities alike, I was here. Thailand. \nAs I entered the Kingdom I had a vague expectation\
  \ of scenes from The Hangover movie. As I made my way from Bangkok to Pattaya, a\
  \ pickup truck with six people in the back flew down the motorway, past a temple\
  \ on the roadside. I had arrived.\nBut moving away from the cities into the heart\
  \ of authentic Thailand was where me story really came to life. I ventured off with\
  \ a Thai family from a tiny little village near Korat. Firstly, they picked me up\
  \ in their family saloon and I noticed they had very little English. After a few\
  \ hours on the road, we stopped off At a restaurant where we all cooked our own\
  \ food in front of our very eyes. This was the first highlight of my trip.\nAs a\
  \ frog kept across the floor and by the kitchen, as we boiled our noodles and pork,\
  \ I was beginning to quickly acclimatise to the Thai ways.\nThe next day, things\
  \ got even better. The family took my to heir home and I got to eat home cooked\
  \ food and relax outside on the bamboo-made seat. Things got interesting then when\
  \ some local builders who also hadn\u2019t a word of English, beckoned me over to\
  \ drink some Thai whiskey with them. Hesitant at first, I was polite and declined\
  \ but then gave in as we were starting to joke around. This clear whiskey was alien\
  \ to me, a \u201Cfarang\u201D but went down the hatch swimmingly. One of the builders\
  \ then took out a slingshot and started slinging stones at an old paint tin a few\
  \ metres away. I was silently thinking \u201Cat what point do these guys actually\
  \ work?!\u201D. After a few glasses of whiskey and two attempts at the slingshot,\
  \ it was time to go to the local cafe, which consisted of a small truck with some\
  \ electricity to power the blender. I had a lovely iced coffee as he Thai lady of\
  \ the family I stayed with tried to hook me up with the barista girl.\nSo much happened\
  \ in those two days, that opened my eyes and that changed me as a person. It\u2019\
  s amazing how humans can communicate on so many levels without the language challenge\
  \ hindering either side. At the end of he day the Thais probably learnt as much\
  \ from me as I did from them. Overall, an enjoyable experience that has been the\
  \ highlight of my trip so far and something I\u2019ll never forget."
