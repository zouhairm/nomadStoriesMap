Text: "After so much of confusion i finally found my seat in a train which was overcrowded\
  \ with all unknown faces. I was watching people from my window confused while finding\
  \ there seats in train. In the scenario i found out two eyes staring at me and i\
  \ tried my best to ignore them.\nAfter some stations my entire compartment got emptied\
  \ and i remained alone. Suddenly i found those eyes again besides me smiling at\
  \ me, sitting in front of me. I smiled back and we started talking. I should mention\
  \ here that in a country like india one should always have to stay alert from unknowns.\
  \ \nHe was a nice personality to get attracted to. He said he was a soldier and\
  \ likes to travel and explore. He shared his experiences in the army as well as\
  \ traveling. He had been to the golden city where i was going to. He suggested me\
  \ some of the places where i can have fun. In those 2 hours we had beautiful long\
  \ conversation. When our destination came i found out that those two eyes didn't\
  \ want to go away.\nBefore we got down he suddenly held my hand and kissed me and\
  \ i remained overwhelmed. \nHe had a duty on a border. He had to go. I had to go.\
  \ We left with the unsaid hope to meet again. We came out of the station together\
  \ without uttering a word. I found my cab and waved at him. I could hear him requesting\
  \ my driver to keep me on special care. \nI checked-in in a hotel-cum-haveli and\
  \ headed towards my room which was royally designed. \nNext day i went to explore\
  \ the city and i could find traces of kings ruled there hundreds of years ago. People\
  \ still stay in havelis yellow in color which has given the city the unique name\
  \ \"golden city\".\nI went to the palace museum which actually was a palace before,\
  \ converted into museum where i saw ancient bedrooms, living rooms, royal wears,\
  \ ornaments, weapons and so on. I could actually in the era for a while!! I could\
  \ sense their livings before ages. \nThis visit followed by giant jaisalmer fort\
  \ of the history of 800years. It is one of the few living forts in the world. 1/4th\
  \ of the total population of the city stays in a fort. The fort was itself known\
  \ as a city.\nI visited one or two forts-cum-museums. Best thing about these properties\
  \ is they take you to the era and you can live those times again. You can feel the\
  \ royalty which is still there in each wall of every house and forts and even in\
  \ the blood of every citizen.\nI faced so much of trouble while purchasing and choosing\
  \ handmade art items from the huge beautiful collection. These people are real-artholic.\
  \ It is the heaven of artist.\nI did a jeep safari in a desert which is the most\
  \ thrilling activity in the desert. This is followed by camal safari and a normal\
  \ photo-session which looked 100 times better than HD clicks because of the the\
  \ extraordinary nature's beuty.\nIn the evening i was taken to a cultural programme\
  \ including playing musical-instruments which are only available in that city, singing\
  \ and spectacular dance in their unique traditional wear. Seating arrangements made\
  \ for me made me feel like a queen! Snacks and tea been served during the event\
  \ in the same way it used to serve to ancient kings and queens. These people perfectly\
  \ know how to win someone's heart.\nDinner arrangements were also royal. It was\
  \ served and introduced in a traditional way.\nDesert camping was the one of the\
  \ best thing i had done there. I woke up early in the morning to feel the peace\
  \ and cold breezes in the camping.\nNext day i went to war museum where those two\
  \ eyes told me they would be there. I explored the museum and was searching for\
  \ two eyes. Then i came to know that he had gone from there. Okay! Better luck next\
  \ time!\nI left the city which had so much in it including those two eyes, that\
  \ evening!!!\nLooking forward to seeing them again...!!!"
