Text: "I still remember when I took the plane, and I arrive after a first bad beginning\
  \  and I start the journey in a city called W\xFCrzburg in Germany. This journey\
  \ began with: \u201Cwelcome to your Erasmus\u201D, one of the first words that I\
  \ heard in my first days after arriving, a funny word to me in the beginning and\
  \ maybe some people from my country (Mexico) don\u2019t know the meaning of that\
  \ word either. I later found out that that\u2019s how they call the exchange students\
  \ who live in Europe, so yeah... I wasn\u2019t exactly an Erasmus, but they just\
  \ keep calling everyone like that.\n\nA new continent, new language, new way of\
  \ life. Some of us know that we might not see our family and friends in a while,\
  \ so you actually start a life from scratch, which is kind of scary and exciting\
  \ at the same time\u2026 but wow. My world was about to expand a lot, believe me,\
  \ because it\u2019s not until you go out of your home and out of your comfort zone,\
  \ that you notice more than ever, with other eyes, with different words, and with\
  \ other ways of thinking, and that\u2019s where you notice something, you notice\
  \ how small we actually are, and how big the world actually is.\n\nHere, you can\
  \ be happy with so little, your small room is a proof of it. You just don\u2019\
  t care, you start to \u201Cbuild your room\u201D from scratch, and you need to take\
  \ care of yourself in all aspects. Everyone has the same, everyone moves around\
  \ the same way, everyone wants to travel cheap. Nobody minds about the way you dress,\
  \ no matter from where you came from, here you\u2019re not someone for what you\
  \ have; here you\u2019re someone for who you are.\n\nDuring my entire journey, some\
  \ people might say that the most important things were the places, the food, the\
  \ beers (yes, maybe) or the architecture... and yes, those were important too, but\
  \ not the most important ones. After all those trips, I figured out what the important\
  \ thing in a journey was, and it is kind of simple actually: the people.\n\nThe\
  \ trips, and my stay here was just special for the people that I met and the time\
  \ that I spent with them. We all have our own stories, but we all came here to make\
  \ just one, one that will live forever.\n\nPeople start to be like a second family\
  \ to you, you notice you're not alone. More people in the same mood are around.\
  \ They want to travel, to keep making good memories, and keep meeting more people.\
  \ It\u2019s like speaking the same language, and you just feel so happy for it.\n\
  \nYou start to notice that we have more in common than what makes us different.\
  \ we all have problems, we all have something to fight for, we all have dreams,\
  \ we all have something or someone to love, family or someone important that will\
  \ wait for us etc,, all that makes us humans.\n\nAnd then, that\u2019s when you\
  \ noticed that one important thing: \"It doesn't matter where you come from, what\
  \ your religion is, your sexual orientation, your language or the way you see life\
  \ because in the end... we all laugh in the same language.\u201D\n\n Some would\
  \ say \u201Cit\u2019s sad because it\u2019s over\u201D but I'm happier because it\
  \ happened. I\u2019ll tell you this: my eyes have seen the most beautiful places,\
  \ I met the coolest people, I heard the most amazing stories and I learned a lot,\
  \ about myself and about the world (follow the omens of life and you will get it).\n\
  \nI know for sure this is not over. Some people will still have more adventures\
  \ there, some people will leave soon, some people even said it was \u201Cthe beginning\
  \ of the end\u201D, but no. This is not the beginning of the end, this is just the\
  \ beginning of another beginning.\n\nW\xFCrzburg isn\u2019t special for the place\
  \ or the location... W\xFCrzburg was special for us, so let's just keep making all\
  \ the places special. The adventure didn\u2019t start in W\xFCrzburg, the adventure\
  \ started before, and the adventure will keep on going..."
