Text: "\u201CAre we planning on becoming Monson taxpayers?\u201D Amazonian asked only\
  \ somewhat jokingly. We\u2019d been camped in the backyard of Shaw\u2019s Hostel\
  \ in Monson, Maine for five days already, waiting for my leg to heal. It seemed\
  \ like my tendinitis was improving, but we were still unsure if we\u2019d be able\
  \ to complete our thru hike.\n\nFive months before, we had started hiking north\
  \ from Springer Mountain, the southern terminus of the Appalachian Trail, which\
  \ runs from Georgia to Maine. Prior to that, we had only been on a handful of backpacking\
  \ trips. With each day on the trail, we became stronger, building up our daily miles\
  \ as we passed through Georgia\u2019s 79 miles of trail, then zigzaging along the\
  \ North Carolina/Tennessee border. The 550 miles in Virginia had been seemingly\
  \ endless--state borders were our milestones and we hadn\u2019t crossed one in a\
  \ month--but beautiful. \n\nWe\u2019d hiked on mostly smooth, gently sloping gradients,\
  \ through a mixture of forests and fields, petted feral ponies in the Grayson Highlands,\
  \ climbed up and down a particularly pointy pinnacle known as Dragon\u2019s Tooth,\
  \ and passed under the Guillotine, a precariously balanced boulder over the trail.\
  \ We\u2019d finally broken twenty miles in a day when we entered the Shenandoahs\
  \ and then we repeated that feat four more times in a row. By the time we got to\
  \ West Virginia, Maryland, and then Pennsylvania, we felt like true \u201Cthru hikers.\u201D\
  \ \n\nThen we arrived in Duncannon, PA. The elevation profile was still mostly flat,\
  \ but the trail turned to endless rocks. Big boulders, but especially smaller rocks,\
  \ almost like the ones that flank railroad tracks, slowed us. Every step was uneven,\
  \ our ankles wobbling as we tried to keep from falling. I became ill, a wrenching\
  \ pain in my gut compounding the difficulty of navigating the rocks. The tread wore\
  \ off my boots and I regularly tripped over rocks, ripping the sides and toes of\
  \ my shoes.\n\nAfter ten days of illness, I finally felt better. I purchased flimsy\
  \ sneakers in Port Clinton, but at least my shoes were no longer held together by\
  \ duct tape. In Delaware Water Gap, we went to a show at the Deer Head Inn, the\
  \ longest continuously-operating jazz club in the country, and the next morning,\
  \ we crossed the bridge into New Jersey, belting out Bruce Springsteen songs to\
  \ celebrate. \n\nWe made good time through New Jersey, making it within twenty miles\
  \ of the New York border, before my leg swelled up. My cheap sneakers hadn\u2019\
  t provided adequate support and the resulting tendinitis made walking impossible.\
  \ With summer slipping by us, we weren\u2019t sure we would be able to make it to\
  \ Mount Katahdin before the snow. Not knowing whether we\u2019d be able to finish\
  \ our thru hike, we booked a bus to Boston and then Bangor, Maine, before getting\
  \ a shuttle to Monson. \n\nMonson is on the edge of the 100-Mile Wilderness, the\
  \ final push for northbound thru hikers. At this point, NOBOs have traveled 2,100\
  \ miles through fourteen states. After 100 miles without road crossings, hikers\
  \ arrive at Abol Bridge, a tiny outpost with a view of Katahdin rising in the distance.\
  \ A day later, hikers arrive at Baxter State Park, and from there, it\u2019s a grueling\
  \ five miles up Katahdin to the summit. Almost everyone on the trail has been imagining\
  \ arriving at the summit sign for months, if not years. \n\nAs my leg healed, Amazonian\
  \ and I started to test it on day hikes, first around town, and later, venturing\
  \ into the Wilderness. After ten days, the swelling was gone and we had hiked five,\
  \ ten, and then fifteen miles without incident. We booked a shuttle to Millinocket,\
  \ a town close to Baxter, and planned our summit. \n\nA day later, we arrived at\
  \ Baxter to climb Katahdin. If we were successful, we planned to hike south back\
  \ to where we\u2019d left off in New Jersey. For a year prior to setting foot on\
  \ the trail, Katahdin had been our destination; Amazonian observed that jumping\
  \ ahead to Katahdin \u201Cwas like skipping to the end of the book.\u201D Now, our\
  \ goal had become a non-descript gravel road just outside of Unionville, NY, 845\
  \ miles away."
