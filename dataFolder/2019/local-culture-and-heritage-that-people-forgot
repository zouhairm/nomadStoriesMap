Text: "This is start in 2013, when me and my friend start to plan how to escape from\
  \ our routinity, so we plan our trip to one of indonesia's province, East Java and\
  \ visit  two cities, Jombang and Mojokerto. Some of my friend and relative asking\
  \ our choice of travel destination because they think there are nothing interest\
  \ in both cities, but we have a reason. We tired trip to big cities like Bandung\
  \ or Yogyakarta and we choose to try something new. the reason why we choose both\
  \ cities because it have different character and uniqueness with historical and\
  \ cultural value. \nJombang is a city with nuance of islam, where we can find Pondok\
  \ Pesantren (islamic Boarding School) and grave of Moslem Clerics in the city including\
  \ Abdurrahman Wahid's graveyard, the fourth Indonesian President and Popular Cleric\
  \ in my country.  meanwhile, Mojokerto especially Trowulan district is city where\
  \ you can see amount of ancient heritage from one of Indonesia's biggest kingdom\
  \ in History, Majapahit. We go to Jombang using Economic Train with transit in Kutoharjo\
  \ first then go to Yogya for stay the night and take the next train tomorrow morning\
  \ to Jombang. \nSoon after we arrived in Jombang, we directly visit Abdurrahman\
  \ Wahid's graveyard in Tebuireng district. When visit Wahid's Graveyard, i feel\
  \ really excited there, because i could visit and give pray to one of our toughest\
  \ president in History.  There, i could see many people come to visit the graveyard,\
  \ not only Moslem, but also Non-Moslem, because Wahid is also known as pluralism\
  \ figure in Indonesia. We also see many merchant offering us souvenir from shirt,\
  \ mug and cap with Wahid's photo and Quote then my friend buying one of shirt they're\
  \ offered. \nBeside visit Wahid's graveyard, we also visit Pondok Pesantren at Denanyar\
  \ distict and see how Pesantren's life where student should wake up early to Praying\
  \ and reading Qur'an. We also visit K.H. Bisri Syamsuri's graveyard, also prominent\
  \ local Moslem Clerics and fortunately, we came in the right time, so  we also could\
  \ attend his haul (kind of commemeration of someone's death) and see thousands of\
  \ people, from Pesantren's student to local people come and pray for him in Islamic\
  \ ritual. Jombang itself is a pluralism city, even well-known as \"City of Moslem\
  \ Student\", we still found some church, vihara and Chinese temple there. Religious\
  \ harmony and tolerance really practiced well in that city. \nAfter spending two\
  \ days in Jombang, we visit Trowulan, Mojokerto, where we saw many Majapahit's heritage\
  \ there. From Museum, Pendopo (a center of Kingdom complex), temple and old cemeteries\
  \ there. There are many sacred graveyard in Trowulan and we told by local people\
  \ that many people come and do some ritual there, especially local politician in\
  \ election's time. the interesting part in trowulan itself there are some Moslem's\
  \ cemetery there even Majapahit is Hindu's kingdom, including Princess of Champa,\
  \ an Empress of one of Majapahit's King. There are many pilgrim come to that graveyard\
  \ for praying and searching for luck. a local people said that praying there is\
  \ efficacious and it proved by many pilgrim who come again and sometimes donate\
  \ their money for renovating cemeteries complex. We also not forget visiting Brahu\
  \ Temple, which someone claim that the temple is the oldest buddhist temple in Trowulan,\
  \ even we have to walking away, because its located far from main street, but we're\
  \ still excited.\nIn Trowulan itself, we find one Buddhist Vihara with Giant Sleeping\
  \ Buddha Statue. Where later we find out that the statue is 2nd Largest in South\
  \ East Asia dan the vihara itself open for Public, so we could see some people praying\
  \ there.  It is really interesting to see many religious influence in one historic\
  \ district, I didn't expect to see many heritage from different culture blended\
  \ and create an acculturation, thus for me, this journey not just an ordinary journey,\
  \ but a journey that make me really proud with my local culture, something that\
  \ mostly people forgot in Globalization era.\nLastly,  i also hope in the future\
  \ many people especially local Indonesian come to Jombang and Trowulan, not just\
  \ for travelling, but learning how their culture and civiliation in the past that\
  \ made Indonesia today."
