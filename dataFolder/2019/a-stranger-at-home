Text: "Never could I imagine that going home would be such a long and risky trip.\
  \ I left my hometown Donetsk when I was seventeen to study in the city of my dreams\
  \ Berlin. Could I know back then, 5 years ago, that my home would never be the same\
  \ anymore? That I would be looking at the streets I grew up like a stranger who\
  \ sees it for the first time? If I knew the war would come to destroy the walls\
  \ I loved, would I run so fast to leave them?\n\nI knew this trip would expose old\
  \ wounds which I was carefully trying to hide from myself. At the moment my life\
  \ was a huge mess. I was changing countries like socks. I didn\u2019t know where\
  \ I truly belong. Being lost in the maze of unanswerable questions I decided to\
  \ go back to my roots. I had to go home no matter how complicated the road would\
  \ be.\n\nSo my trip started at Berlin airport. If earlier I could just take a direct\
  \ two-hours flight from Berlin to Donetsk, this time I had to go to Kyiv, the capital\
  \ of Ukraine. My old friend met me there for a few hours before the train. She moved\
  \ from Donetsk to Kyiv a couple of months ago, and I was overwhelmed by the traces\
  \ of the war in her young and beautiful face. She looked devastated. \u201CAre you\
  \ sure you want to go there? Please stay calm and take care of yourself!\xBB, she\
  \ said.\n\nThen I spent a long night in the old Soviet train. I climbed on the second\
  \ shelf trying to distance myself from the dust. My neighbors were two elderly women\
  \ whispering about politics. Everyone there was talking about politics. It became\
  \ an inevitable part of daily life. With the sound of their voices and the steady\
  \ clickety-clack of steel wheels I fell asleep.\n \nIn the morning the train finally\
  \ arrived to Volnovakha, a small town near the front line. I had to cross the border\
  \ between Ukraine and Donetsk People Republic. I had a special permit and my parents\
  \ gave me detailed instructions on what to say and how to behave. I was not supposed\
  \ to say I'm coming from Europe but it was too late when I noticed that I forgot\
  \ to remove my luggage tag. The Donetsk soldiers asked me hundreds of questions,\
  \ took my fingertips and made pictures of me. Then I had to wait. \n\nIn total,\
  \ I spent more than eight hours in the mined field surrounded by armed soldiers.\
  \ It was snowing but no one cared about freezing young and old people standing outside\
  \ in the queue. We all just wanted to go home, to the people and places we loved.\n\
  \nSuddenly, I saw my dad\u2019s face in the crowd. He was waiting for me on the\
  \ other side. I started to run and when I finally reached his arms, I couldn\u2019\
  t hold my tears. I cried on his shoulder trying to erase all this humiliation I\
  \ went through just to be there, on the earth I was born.\n \nFinally, we entered\
  \ Donetsk. The city of one million roses, the city of Euro-2012 with one of the\
  \ biggest football stadiums in Europe, the city of ironworks and mines. Now the\
  \ streets which earlier were full of cars and traffic jams were absolutely empty.\
  \ The buildings were fully or partly destroyed. It was not a wealthy and beautiful\
  \ city I remembered. It was a ghost town. \n\n\u201CAre you okay?\u201D I heard\
  \ my dad's voice through the haze. \u201CHow are you living here?\xBB I asked. My\
  \ dad smiled, \xABPeople are able to adjust to everything. It's just a reality now.\xBB\
  \ \n \nStill, there was one thing which stayed the same. My beloved flat. The same\
  \ smell of mom\u2019s delicious borscht and vareniki, the sound of Ukrainian songs\
  \ she was listening while cooking, the same fluffy blanket on my bed and my lonely\
  \ teddy bear sitting on top of it. This small world of three of us stayed the same.\
  \ I was home."
