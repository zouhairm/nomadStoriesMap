Text: "There I was, smiling as I posed beside an eight feet long Komodo Dragon. We\
  \ were together in its cage, and taking into account its strength and size, I was\
  \ evidently at disadvantage or so I thought.\nAlthough we were only in Indonesia\
  \ for a short time, we wanted to visit the surroundings a bit. The Taman Mini -located\
  \ half an hour by car from Jakarta- recreates the Indonesian culture and the life\
  \ of its 26 provinces, embodying it in different elements including architecture,\
  \ dance, clothing and traditions. It seemed like the right choice to soak up a little\
  \ of Indonesia in the limited time we had. Walking through the stone path, we found\
  \ buildings so colorful that seemed like Leonid Afremov\u2019s artwork, some were\
  \ closed spaces, others were roofs just supported by pillars; in some we had to\
  \ go in barefoot, which created a funny sight of a shoe parade along the staircases.\
  \ The whole park was full of stone sculptures: engraved animals, deities, flowers,\
  \ etc. Wherever you looked there were people dancing, singing or playing traditional\
  \ songs, dressed up in splendid handmade costumes. We spotted a cableway, a museum\
  \ and a greenhouse:  it was a wonderful mini world, just like Jurassic Park, but\
  \ with an oriental ambiance and without the terrifying dinosaurs chasing you around,\
  \ despite the feeling that you could bump into an animal anytime. We almost got\
  \ run over by a black carriage with fancy golden ornaments that carried a bride\
  \ to her wedding.\nAfter almost 7 hours in the park, the amount of tourists and\
  \ the tiredness we felt eased the decision of going into an empty reptiliary with\
  \ some benches to rest a while. The moment we sat down, we noticed a big pit that\
  \ was behind the bench. It was a cage, and within it there was something I haven\u2019\
  t seen in any other place so far: a Komodo dragon. After a few minutes of being\
  \ astonished by the size of the creature, I noticed another figure inside the cage\
  \ that impressed me even more. A man. Obviously what caused me terror was not the\
  \ man, but the thought that he might have fallen in accidentally and needed help.\
  \ But after the initial shock, I saw that he was pretty calm putting some fresh\
  \ meat into a hollow log and refilling the pond with a water hose. I supposed he\
  \ had already noticed my previous fascination with the dragon because as soon as\
  \ I looked at him, he just smiled at me and said:\n\"Want picture?\"\nAt first I\
  \ didn\u2019t understand what he meant but when the hand signaled me to come down,\
  \ I did it without thinking. It was until I was inside the cage that I realized\
  \ I was probably at risk by invading the animal\u2019s space. The man pointed to\
  \ the giant lizard and somehow I managed to gather some bravery to go and settle\
  \ right behind the reptile with rough grayish skin that laid placidly by the shade\
  \ of the only tree in his cage. I avoided his huge tail which was refreshing in\
  \ the water of the pond and I squatted. I smiled at the camera, made a \"V\" symbol\
  \ with my fingers and once the guy had taken the picture, before getting up again,\
  \ I turned to face the dragon. \nThe connection between our looks made me regret\
  \ having gone down just to take a photo.\nFrom that day on, my vision of travelling\
  \ changed completely. I do not like zoos, seeing enclosed animals, I prefer venturing\
  \ to see them in freedom. The sadness in the eyes of the Komodo dragon touched me\
  \ deeply, it had neither the strength nor the desire to hurt me, all that was left\
  \ was the resignation of spending his days in a cage that would never let him go\
  \ further than if it were in its natural habitat and that\u2019s something I wouldn\u2019\
  t like to see ever again, human nor animal. In the end, our species has also been\
  \ caged and enslaved by our craving for knowledge and power, blinding us from being\
  \ sensitive and accepting that we are part of a whole, which is part of us too."
