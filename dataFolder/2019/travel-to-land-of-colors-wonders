Text: "Travel to Land of Colors & Wonders \nVisiting India at the first sight was\
  \ so disappointing to me and I felt a deep regret for going on such a trip. Traffic\
  \ jam, dirt and pollution was really annoying me. However, as time passed little\
  \ by little I felt I have to change my point of view to ignore negative points and\
  \ enjoy my trip. I did so, and wow what a sight! Every corner of India is an absolute\
  \ wonder. It is so special, as you imagine yourself in an unknown world where you\
  \ can explore things in every moment of your trip.\nYou should feel India in your\
  \ hearth to perceive its wonders. Its astonishing beautiful colors make you amazed.\
  \ Its caring and welcoming people make your journey unforgettable. Its delicious\
  \ spicy foods rich in vegetables stimulate your taste and make you look at them\
  \ admirably.\nIts markets full of special Indian stuff in different colors can be\
  \ a good place to buy souvenirs and its temples and ancient places makes you feel\
  \ and comprehend the meaning of -Country of Seventy Two Nations-.\nIn travelling\
  \ to India, you would better pass its golden triangle including Delhi, Agra and\
  \ Jaipur. \nI started my journey from Delhi and after crossing the sides and angles\
  \ of this triangle finished up in Delhi again.\nDelhi is one the most ancient cities\
  \ in the world and it is believed to have been stablished 5000 years ago. Delhi\
  \ is the home of different religions and sects as well as various tribes and cultures.\n\
  After visiting Delhi, I got to know why among all practices, Yoga is the most favorable\
  \ one to Indian people who are looking for peace of mind far from daily negative\
  \ thoughts.\nRed Temple, Humayun\u2019s Tomb, Qutub Minar, Akshardham Temple and\
  \ colorful markets, astonishes every tourist in there.\nIn India, you have no idea\
  \ what you are going to face. The adventure and newness of everything make you look\
  \ around in ager and record every moment of your trip. One of its wonders is Agra\
  \ city. I was astounded once I saw this city and its most important site locating\
  \ like a shiny pearl by the Yamuna River. No one can depict the beauty of \u201C\
  Taj Mahal\u201D which is sitting like a beautiful bride on her throne. You cannot\
  \ believe this amount of beauty!\nYou can feel the love story of \u201CShah Jahan\u201D\
  \ and \u201CMumtaz Mahal\u201D in the body of \u201CTaj Mahal\u201D. Taj Mahal is\
  \ the symbol of love and loyalty to a partner. This building is truly one of the\
  \ seven wonder of the world. When I was walking around it, I was thinking if \u201C\
  Shah Jahan\u201D did not meet \u201CMumtaz Mahal\u201D there would not be such a\
  \ beautiful wonder. Therefore, this true love has added another miracle to our wonderful\
  \ world.\nTo talk about Jaipur, I should say it looks very beautiful with its pink\
  \ color and its lovely streets. It is beautiful in its own way. Traveling to India,\
  \ you should visit this city, as it is the center of Rajesthan province, full of\
  \ eye catching ancient places. Once I entered Jaipur, I saw many pink buildings\
  \ and a lot of old places that I dare to say they are unique in their own way. Jaipur\
  \ is called Pink City because of theses pink buildings.\nAt the end, I can say that\
  \ I had a trip to the land of myths and gods, to a mysterious country rich in culture\
  \ and history. I finished my trip by returning from Delhi to my city with a bunch\
  \ of beautiful memories and I wrote a new page of experience about wonderlands in\
  \ my life. \nHere I dare to say there are still a lot of mysterious places in India\
  \ where I could not visit,\nMaybe another time\u2026"
