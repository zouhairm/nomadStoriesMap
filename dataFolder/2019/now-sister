Text: "Gloria\u2019s breasts hang low after having raised 12 children and being exposed\
  \ to the elements for the majority of her 57 years.  Ember\xE1 women do not typically\
  \ wear shirts or bras, though the tradition is lessening with each passing generation.\
  \  On her lower half she wears a patterned neon wrap--the paruma--and around her\
  \ neck a series of beaded necklaces.  Her long straight black hair is hip-length,\
  \ her eyes narrow, and her features neither approximate those of a Latina nor those\
  \ of the mountain tribes.\n\nWhen I meet Gloria she is squatting over a single burner\
  \ stove on the floor of her stilted home.  Turning to my friend Sarah, she puckers\
  \ her lips as if to point to my chest.  \u201CHer breasts,\u201D she whispers, \u201C\
  are very small!\u201D  I laugh, as the gesture speaks for itself without need for\
  \ translation.  Gloria smiles at me and adds \u201Cbut very nice!\u201D  And this\
  \ is our icebreaker.  Within the first hour, Gloria shows me her assortment of parumas-\
  \ each one alarmingly colorful and distinct in its design.  There\u2019s the orange\
  \ and green owl print, the red and black chicken, the lime green dolphin, and of\
  \ course, this month\u2019s peppermint stick.  She tells me how she goes all the\
  \ way to Panama City to receive them.  I imagine the long line of Ember\xE1 and\
  \ Wounaan women forming in the indigenous street market and how they exchange the\
  \ latest gossip as they wait in the sweltering heat.  I think about tradition can\
  \ bring even the most distanced of people out of their homes and into each other\u2019\
  s lives.\n\nNext, Gloria sends us on a mission.  We are to prepare jagua with the\
  \ help of her grandson, Gan.  Jagua is a fruit with a brown fleshy skin, a meaty\
  \ white interior and blue-black seeds.  When it is just right for painting it is\
  \ neither too hard nor too soft--the seeds must be pliable but the exterior firm.\
  \ We grate the jagua on a perforated can of sardines and heat the shavings over\
  \ the stove until they turn black.  Water is added as it simmers, and finally, a\
  \ deep blue dye is extracted from the pulpy mess.\n\nWhen we finish preparing the\
  \ ink, Gloria motions to me to come down from the house to the communal area adjacent\
  \ to the soccer field.  She orders me to remove my top, but unaccustomed to public\
  \ nudity, I keep my hands over my nipples.  From the lofted living rooms in my periphery,\
  \ I feel the eyes of the village on my starkly white and \u201Cvery small breasts.\u201D\
  \  I watch as Gloria carves a two pronged pen from the spine of a palm leaf.  And\
  \ then it begins.  \n\nGloria starts by painting a thick black band around my wrists\
  \ and elbows using a spent corncob as a paintbrush.  With the pen, she details a\
  \ series of triangles and crosses in between them.  Not a word is spoken, and as\
  \ bystanders approach to spectate I am uncertain if this is ritual or vanity or\
  \ somewhere in between.  She applies another thick band around my upper arm and\
  \ once again fills the space between with thinner geometric patterns.  After applying\
  \ the ink to my face, I know what\u2019s next.  I surrender my hands from my chest,\
  \ close my eyes, and allowed Gloria to paint my breasts.\n\nThe Ember\xE1 habitually\
  \ refer to one another as sister or brother, and so, as Gloria finishes she says\
  \ only two words: \"Now, Sister.\u201D  I open my eyes to see that the sun has begun\
  \ to set around us, that flocks of parrots and egrets fly upriver to roost, and\
  \ that I\u2019m surrounded by a sea of multicolored parumas, topless women and painted\
  \ bodies not unlike my own.  I think about how we define the word \u201Csister\u201D\
  \ in my culture so narrowly, how the silence shared between women is a language\
  \ I am lucky to comprehend, and how tradition, once again, can bring even the most\
  \ distanced of people into each other\u2019s lives."
