Text: "The moment I reached Perlis,  the smell of nature welcomed\nme and as i reached\
  \ to my homestay not far from the railway\nstation, Mak tok (The house owner) welcomed\
  \ me dearly with \nopen arms. Another thing that amazes me is how they preserve\n\
  the culture.\n\nFor example, before stepping into the house, we will have to\nwash\
  \ our feet with the water filled in the vase before entering.\nThis is to respect\
  \ the house of the owner and to maintain cleanliness.\n\nLater on at night, Mak\
  \ tok served us her homemade food she\ncooked. At that point, it was really beautiful\
  \ to see everyone\ngather for dinner regardless how busy or tired one is.\n\nBelieve\
  \ me or not, I was awaken by the sound of the cooking utensils as early\nas 5 a.m.\
  \ in the morning. The next thing i knew, Mak Tok was \ncooking breakfast for us\
  \ (including her children). By 8 in the\nmorning, Akimi, the village boy, brought\
  \ me around the village.\nI was shocked to see the locals having a really heavy\
  \ breakfast\nthere as early as 8!\n\nOn the other hand, I love how peaceful the\n\
  neighbourhood is. From trucks parked right outside their house,\nto the rocky roads\
  \ and even blocked road, which is the only passage\nway to other location yet the\
  \ local villagers could still stop and have a\nchat even though they are not close\
  \ with one another and not get\nbothered by the blocked road. Amazing isn't it!\
  \ I just love everything about Perlis at that\nmoment and it was only just the start.\n\
  \nOn the third day, Akimi brought me to the local market there.\nThe market somehow\
  \ reminded me of the old Geylang Serai where\nfood, snacks and clothes were all\
  \ sold in that closured area.\n\nMost of the sellers who sells their goods were\
  \ the Siamese, Thai people.\nIt\u2019s not surprising for me because across the\
  \ village i lived at\nwere called the \u2018Siam  Village\u2019. It is where most\
  \ thai people live.\nTherefore it explains why there are the Thai\u2019s living\
  \ here.\n\nHowever, one thing I realised there was that, money, appearence and\n\
  brands did not matter to them at all. All that matters is to have a\ncontented life\
  \ and have a beautiful time together with their loved ones.\n\nBy the time i got\
  \ back home, Mak Tok and her family were having dinner.\nYet again, i feel very\
  \ content just looking at them gather almost\nevery night.\n\nGuess what! I finally\
  \ woke up as early as Mak Tok and rush\nto use the toilet first before anyone in\
  \ the house does. God\nknows how tiring and a struggle it was living in a village\
  \ with\nlimited water supplies!\n\nBy the time the sun rises, so many hidden treasures\n\
  were discovered. Seeing abandoned vans to snake shedded\nskin and being able to\
  \ witness the morning dew everywhere\naround you is priceless!  You can barely find\
  \ hidden treasures\nin a natured environment in Singapore.\n\nHow welcoming and\
  \ friendly everyone was in Perlis. The freshly\nmade goods as early in the morning,\
  \ to how relax the people there\ncan be, having transportation by their mining trucks\
  \ on the side of\nthe road or even by the \u2018sampan\u2019, crafting things from\
  \ scratch like\ncar plates even and the collected water in the unused bottles just\n\
  incase they ran out of water supply there. The simple and rural life\neases my heart\
  \ as i spend my days there, leaving me a heavy heart\nhaving to make my way back\
  \ to Singapore."
