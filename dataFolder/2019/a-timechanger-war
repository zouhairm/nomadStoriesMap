Text: "Hi my name is Agent X And I am about to tell you a story about the timechanger\
  \ war or World War III if you prefer it that way It all began when some evil scientist\
  \ made nuclear power weapons so well he decided to  bomb the United States of America\
  \ with a giant nuclear missile that covered the entire country at once At that time\
  \ it was time for all the time changers and time keepers for every district to team\
  \ up and start World War III or end it So we had to go in together from every district\
  \ across every time periods across all the dimensions the ever was  Not everybody\
  \ knew each other since we only worked in our own dimensions so this was the first\
  \ time all of us a not everybody knew each other since we only worked in our own\
  \ dimensions so this was the first time all of us have gotten together all at once\
  \ Once we figured out where those missiles were coming from we knew we had to go\
  \ to the source Afghanistan so we just used our ability orb over there  once we\
  \ saw who the madman was and his evil army  we knew that we had made the right decision\
  \ it was time for whore there were tanks missiles    bomber IEDs Explosives you\
  \ know modern day technology for war with some upgraded Armour of course but we\
  \ also went old school with bows and arrows  and swords we can\u2019t forget that\
  \ so you see it was a war of all times Because we had multi time period  starting\
  \ from the first war ever so we started fighting and using our weapons eventually\
  \ the madman escaped we had a chase him all across Afghanistan Eventually we caught\
  \ up to him when he stopped in the mountains just then he activated his wing suit\
  \ and flew into Iraq  eventually we caught up to him when he stopped in the mountains\
  \ just then he activated his wing suit and flew into Iraq  then it was time to activate\
  \ the time changers in time keepers from the other countries across the world and\
  \ every other time zone  of course they helped us with the search and we finally\
  \ caught up with them in Baghdad the most awful place ever especially for the American\
  \ sniper Chris Kyle who eventually met us there from a previous mission that I went\
  \ on Yeah he and I go way back he even taught me how to sniper shoot you can say\
  \ he was my trainer in most things that I know now  but that\u2019s not prudent\
  \ to the story so I will actually have to write about that one meanwhile back to\
  \ World War III with the American snipers help  so there we were in Baghdad where\
  \ the final battle begins of course he has more of his men then there\u2019s a bunch\
  \ of us there\u2019s more weapons involved of course the time to keep her that I\u2019\
  ve been working with lost his eyein this battle but he still keeps on fighting with\
  \ that sword-cane  that\u2019s a really really handy weapon for him to have He brings\
  \ it along with them on every mission that he goes on with me but enough for that\
  \ for now back to World War III the mad name madman\u2019s name was nuclear man\
  \ nickname  Great name huh So I\u2019m the one who ends up fighting nuclear man\
  \ on top of the mountain in Baghdad what do I do we have a sword fight until he\
  \ falls off the edge the rest of the guys destroyed the army that he had and then\
  \ it was time to fix the world and put it back together and make sure world war\
  \ four never happens  so we went back in time and make sure World War III never\
  \ happened the end"
