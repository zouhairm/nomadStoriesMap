Text: "Seven miles. That\u2019s an unsettlingly long detour off the lone highway,\
  \ in scorching 100\xB0F heat, with a man you have known for four days\u2026 to go\
  \ see a cave. The seven mile track has a tough crust of white rocks; it shunts us\
  \ sideways and teases the too-shiny truck with dusty debris.\n\nWe stop to move\
  \ a lizard, a beautiful Shingleback. I video as he swings about in Don\u2019s hand\
  \ and kind-of smiles at me with his flicking blue tongue. I had taken to stealing\
  \ short snippets of Don because I found him to be so meek and unassuming - this\
  \ fascinated me. Red Kangaroos rest in the morning shade of sparse shrubs and one\
  \ huge boomer lopes across our path. Don speculates that we're seeing more \u2018\
  roos as we rumble on, like they know they\u2019re safe from the big road, far behind.\
  \ He\u2019ll never know how many times little thoughts for my personal safety drift\
  \ across my heat-blasted mind.\n\n\u201CYou had other options,\u201D he suggested\
  \ at some point on our eight day road-trip from Adelaide to Perth: The Nullarbor.\
  \ \u201CWhat made you pick me?\u201D\n\u201CWell\u2026 I chose between you and that\
  \ guy Jason - he was going to drive through the night in a Jeep full of backpackers.\
  \ I felt like I was safer taking it slow. Your ad had good grammar. I felt pretty\
  \ confident when I called you.\u201D\nWe were in the middle of one of his classic\
  \ teaching-point-moments. I was really enjoying how candid we had become, strangers\
  \ in a car.\n\u201CAnd, seriously, I\u2019m the fittest I have ever been. I feel\
  \ like I could put up a good fight.\u201D I stared out of my passenger seat at the\
  \ searing red nothing. No one can survive that landscape for too long.\n\u201CYou\
  \ deduced, using all of your available reference points, that I was the safest alternative.\
  \ Our modern concept of a 'good man\u2019 is one who can overcome the natural, hormone\
  \ driven urge to seek out mates, create as many offspring as possible by any means\
  \ necessary, and to kill before he is killed. In other words, I am the choice who\
  \ seems most capable of suppressing his instincts.\u201D\n\nI think about Ricky,\
  \ who\u2019s the only person who knows I\u2019m out at Cocklebiddy Cave that morning\
  \ with Don, whether I should have given him a number to call. He\u2019s one of only\
  \ seven people who live in the town - which is actually a truck stop, motel and\
  \ one huge cage sheltering two equally huge Wedge-tailed Eagles. Ricky and I had\
  \ shared cigarettes and beer the night before as a storm shot across the pink sky,\
  \ miles away. Don tutted at the smokes and shyly chuckled; I knew he was marvelling\
  \ again at my guileless and merry way of engaging with everyone we encountered.\
  \ I was all handstands and singing and no-bra and \u201CHey, how\u2019s it goin\u2019\
  ?!\u201D Later, Don revealed to me he was suffering badly of \u2018reverse culture\
  \ shock\u2019, and that he was shakily facing the unfamiliar as a \u2018grey nomad\u2019\
  \ with his brand new truck and caravan rig. I think he would have had a lonely maiden\
  \ voyage without me.\n\nThe rough limestone track ends at a little information bay.\
  \ I don\u2019t feel guilty about thinking about which rock I could use to pummel\
  \ a head with, because the compound effect of stupid films, real stories, and the\
  \ horrified reactions from friends and family all have me feeling like I\u2019m\
  \ taking a crazy risk here. Driving the Nullarbor is inherently dangerous, and being\
  \ a young woman can make you feel vulnerable any time. The truth is that Don is\
  \ nothing but a peaceful, retired entomologist with daughters just older than me.\
  \ He has so much to share with a hungry mind like mine. \n\nWe hike down together\
  \ to the mouth of an ancient cave. I film a little pan of Don catching and tagging\
  \ butterflies with expert swiftness and grace. My friend the butterfly man. Little\
  \ swallows dive from the craggy cliffs into a gaping chasm where blissfully cool\
  \ air sweeps up and out from the dark. I feel safe."
