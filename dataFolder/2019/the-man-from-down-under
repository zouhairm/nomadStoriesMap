Text: "Look out mate! \n\nA barefooted country Aussie man with a mullet hair-do shouted\
  \ out. \nThis man ran up past me,\nI\u2019m think what? What\u2019s going...\nIv\
  \ looked behind me and this man was no joke wrangling a huge goanna! \n\nHere he\
  \ is half way up a tree grabbed a hold of the goannas tail. \nThe massive goanna\
  \ is squarming, scratching and trying to run up this tree. \nThis mans got him good!\
  \ \nHe finally has control over the goanna by holding him with one hand on his tail\
  \ and the other hand on his neck/head. \n\nYou have got to be kidding me! \nAm I\
  \ seeing this right ? \nWho in there right mind runs up to a goanna and wrangles\
  \ it? \n\nThe Aussie bloke gets him down from the tree. \nI\u2019m intrigued to\
  \ say the least. \nHe comes over to me with the goanna still in his hands \n\u201C\
  I\u2019ll swap you the goanna for your number\u201D he chuckles. \nNah just tricking.\
  \ \nJust checking him for ticks and making sure he\u2019s alright and I\u2019ll\
  \ let him go again but wouldn\u2019t mind your number your a beauty. \n\nI instantly\
  \ laugh. \nYou are crazy! \n\nI can not believe what I have just seen \nGee you\
  \ Australian blokes are an impressive \nBunch.\nI guess you deserve my number after\
  \ that top effort. \n\nThat was fantastic! \n\nI ended up giving him my number.\
  \ \nAs he went to release the goanna the man under estimated the goannas strength\
  \ and latched on to his thumb. \n\nOuch ! \nThat\u2019s got to hurt! \n\nHe was\
  \ yelling in pain as this goanna just wasn\u2019t letting go. \n\nI ended up having\
  \ to call the ambulance for him. \n\nBut hey I guess that\u2019s what happens when\
  \ you wrangle a huge goanna. \n\nHe\u2019s fine a few stitches and a lot of antibiotics\
  \ he almost lost his hand. The doctor wanted to amputate His hand as it was infected\
  \ by the goannas bite with all the diseases they carry.\n\nIt thankfully came good.\
  \ \n\nTurns out this guy has done caught snakes and lizards wit his bare hands his\
  \ whole life since he was 8 years old. \n\nWe have a date this Friday he\u2019s\
  \ showing me a few local waterfalls and hidden hot spots in the Forrest to see some\
  \ wildlife and animals. \n\nI wonder what\u2019s in stall for us next ? \n\nA crocodile\
  \ maybe? \n\nWho\u2019s knows this is straya!"
