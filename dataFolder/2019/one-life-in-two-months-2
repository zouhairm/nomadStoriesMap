Text: "Her name was \xAB Vida \xBB.70 years old donna with whom I spoke for two hours\
  \ sharing past years souvenirs, grieves and joys. We don\u2019t use the same words\
  \ but we are both full of life. Donna is a name of a song. The song I heard in a\
  \ klezmer bar. I danced with tears. Words I don\u2019t understand ripped my heart\
  \ out. Words full of nostalgia were flying out from the instruments. I was dancing\
  \ in a white long dress with red wine in my hand and a shadow by my side. Love.\
  \ He came to Serbia to see the world through my innocent eyes. I was thirsty for\
  \ love, thirsty for life. In the evenings, I drink black coffee in a balcony with\
  \ my Turkish friends. I loved playing coffee fortune telling. Telling me I will\
  \ have a friend and a lover. I put a ring on my cup so it can tell the truth. The\
  \ truth that my new silver ring I got as a surprise in my best Kafana will always\
  \ be a reminder that happiness will be like a mirage. I never felt as happy as I\
  \ were back then in Avala, Zemun and Ada lake. Ada Lake, where I learned that the\
  \ beauty of the sun gets more intense when you get up from falling. Falling is feeling.\
  \ Learning to feel a mix of a fear and courage, the bitterness of an old love and\
  \ the ecstasy of the coming passion and above all learning to live the moment. Only\
  \ that moment when you lay on a big swing looking at the blurred sky and those shining\
  \ tiny stars surrounded with laughs and beautiful souls. Those people make you think\
  \ that you could never be another thing but young. Differences were awkwardly relieving,\
  \ losing my self too. In the streets with a stranger looking at the lights of the\
  \ city from the highest fortress. Standing fearless and bold like the big naked\
  \ statue behind us. Air going through my long hair. Sparky eyes. Recklessness. Time\
  \ didn\u2019t exist. Only that moment is real and then I had to go back to the magic\
  \ hostel but I am lost again. Getting lost with a painter is deep and confusing.\
  \ Stores full of paintings in a gypsy street. Music flying and going through my\
  \ everything. Summer is where I belong. Happy souls are all I want. I wanted to\
  \ stay forever like when we were in the red room. It was one night and two days\
  \ in Novi sad. The orange city where we took the picture from the train window for\
  \ his next jazz album cover. It was as blurry as the sight through my sleepy eyes.\
  \ Staying was not planned. That night, I closed my eyes and wanted to walk straight.\
  \ Believing in myself and that I am all I have got. Playing was so easy. Trying\
  \ to make things happen like when I wanted to talk to those refugees living in that\
  \ bus station sharing some grapes and stories. I felt their pain but also their\
  \ dignity and thirst for life. Their hope. Not so far from Knez Mihailova, that\
  \ lovely place where we go everynight where I refused to buy that notebook because\
  \ I couldn\u2019t admit that all of this will be just a memory. Alone ,I cried for\
  \ the three last days. I should visit all the places and print all the feelings\
  \ into my soul and first of all praying in my little favorite church full of colors,\
  \ lights and whispering music. Where I used to stay for hours filling myself with\
  \ void. That trip weren\u2019t expected and the night I shared my story with the\
  \ 70 years old lady, all I wanted to say is that I am full of love and that I am\
  \ struggling with some feelings like nostalgia and saudade. Back there I loved myself\
  \ and I don\u2019t want to go back to the real world where I have to compete with\
  \ everyone. With myself. Some stories started there and that\u2019s how I knew that\
  \ Beograd is an endless story. Then I just explained to her that Vida means life\
  \ in Spanish."
