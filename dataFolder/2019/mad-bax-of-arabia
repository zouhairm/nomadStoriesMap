Text: "When it rains in the desert of the Arabian Peninsula, it\u2019s miraculous.\
  \ It can also be incredibly dangerous as well and not just because of flash floods\
  \ rushing through the local wadis. \n\nWhen the rain came to the oasis town of Ibri,\
  \ Oman I jumped into my Jeep to survey the damage the Shamalia, the winter storm\
  \ from the north, had wreaked upon my desert outpost. \n\nThe streets had become\
  \ Venetian-style canals flooded with caf\xE9 late colored rainwater. Omani families\
  \ cruised these waterways with the windows of their saloon cars rolled down, their\
  \ desert gondolas for the day. Palms held up to the foreboding sky, they soaked\
  \ in the pungent smell of ozone heavy in the atmosphere. \n\nOn the road that crossed\
  \ the wadi, a normally dry wash, the whitewater rippled across the blacktop about\
  \ a foot deep. The locals who were crossing it slowed to a crawl and put on their\
  \ hazard lights. Not seeing the logic in this tactic, I gunned it across the wadi\
  \ hoping that speed would keep me from being swept away by the current. Spraying\
  \ water in my wake, I quickly overtook a white Lexus with its\u2019 windows rolled\
  \ down, fording the flooded riverbed with ease. \n\nWith the wadi now in my rearview\
  \ mirror, a white Lexus pulled up next to me with four Arabs gesticulating wildly\
  \ for me to pull over. I shook my head and closed my window. They pulled in front\
  \ of me and jacked their breaks, pointing to the side of the road. Reluctantly,\
  \ I pulled over but locked my door before I came to a complete stop. \n\nThe driver\
  \ got out with the sleeves of his white dishdasha (a floor length shirt dress) pushed\
  \ up to the elbows.  With just the glass between us, he motioned for me to open\
  \ the window. As I did, he reached inside to grab me! I hit the button for the window\
  \ to go-up, then the gas and wove in between him, his car and his cronies jumping\
  \ back into their car to give chase. There was barely time for him to get his hand\
  \ out of the window before I peeled out of there, my adrenaline pumping. \n\nSuddenly,\
  \ a black BMW came roaring past. Cutting in front of me, he slammed his breaks -\
  \ forcing me to do the same. Trying to overtake him, he veered wildly, corralling\
  \ me in. With the Bedouins in the Lexus now behind me again I realized they were\
  \ trying to box me in! Feigning compliance, I veered towards the shoulder, dipped\
  \ down through the ditch by the side of the road and up the embankment, hoping to\
  \ lose them with my 4x4 capability.  Momentarily, it worked. \n\nI soon found myself\
  \ slogging through a warren of potholed side streets, puddled with rain. Omani children\
  \ splashed about in the dirty water outside walled compounds. In the rearview mirror\
  \ I saw it \u2013 the white Lexus was right behind me again! One of the bedouin\
  \ hoodlums jumped out in his dishdasha and ran for my door. Just managing to get\
  \ his hand on the door handle, I throttled the gas again as the kids in the alley\
  \ cleared out of the way. \nWinding my way back to the main road, the black BMW\
  \ was waiting. As I pulled onto the two-lane road jammed packed with locals, he\
  \ followed close behind, his bumper nearly touching mine. Behind him, the white\
  \ Lexus. With so much traffic on a narrow, two-way road he couldn\u2019t get past\
  \ me to try to sandwich me in again. Instead, he rammed me from behind trying to\
  \ push me into oncoming traffic! \n\nEyeing a turnout for a petrol station, I let\
  \ the BMW maneuver in front of me. Before the Lexus could ram me from behind, I\
  \ veered though the gas station and slipped into slow-moving traffic moving in the\
  \ opposite direction. Minutes later, the flashing lights of the Omani Royal Police\
  \ appeared in my rearview mirror and I knew the chase was over.  I breathed a sigh\
  \ of relief. \n\nAt the police station, I decided to not press charges and the felony\
  \ against me (I had inadvertently splashed them) was dropped, ilhumdilelah (thanks\
  \ be to God)."
