Text: "Recently, I was in Marrakesh and while shopping, I kept seeing buckets of something\
  \ that resembled  very thick caramel and the colors though dark, varied from different\
  \ hues of green to blue to brown, depending on the vendor),  it turns out it was\
  \ black soap.\nThe soap, although called black soap, has a gooey like consistency\
  \ and is made of olives. The saponification process (the making of something into\
  \ a soap) is done by adding potassium hydroxide. This soap is used in world famous\
  \ hammam spa treatments in Marrakesh.\nThe hammam ritual is a Moroccan tradition,\
  \ which has endured for centuries into the present day. In the hammam, your body\
  \ is cleansed from head to toe. The ritual takes place in a humid steam room, where\
  \ a hammam attendant, will douse you with water before applying the black soap to\
  \ your skin and exfoliating it with a kessa glove (Kessa Gloves are used with black\
  \ soap to deep cleanse the skin by removing dead skin cells, toxins and impurities.\
  \ Blood circulation is stimulated, bringing more oxygen and nutrients to the skin).\n\
  The hammam treatment can be enjoyed is a group or be enjoyed in private setting.\
  \ After the ritual, you usually are served a glass of traditional Moroccan mint\
  \ tea to help restore the balance of fluids.\nSounds amazing, does it not? Think\
  \ again\u2026\nI was staying at the Hotel 2 Ciels in Marrakesh, this hotel had a\
  \ spa that was offering a deal on a hammam treatment followed by a massage, a combination\
  \ I could not pass up, so I signed up.\nI was looking forward to my 1 \xBD hour\
  \ treatment + massage. The time for my appointment finally arrived and I was changed\
  \ and waiting for my masseuse, out comes a short heavy set woman 10 minutes after\
  \ the appointment is set to start, she spoke only French and Arabic while I only\
  \ spoke English, Spanish and preschool French (this should have been my first sign\
  \ and frankly, my opportunity to run out and request a masseuse that spoke my language)\n\
  Since we could not communicate thru our combined 4 languages, she proceeded to communicate\
  \ with the universal language of signs and I understood I needed to follow her.\
  \ We walked into a steam room where she basically ripped the robe off my body and\
  \ suddenly I found myself naked with a paper panty and very aware of my nakedness,\
  \ as if I had just had a bite of the forbidden fruit.\nThe masseuse signals to me\
  \ to sit on the ledge and proceeds to douse me with warm water from head to toe\
  \ in a manner that was almost as if she was trying to bath an unruly 5 year old\
  \ kid, she did not care how she dosed me with Water, I mean, even when I wash my\
  \ dog, I make sure I am careful that I\u2019m not running water thru her eyes, her\
  \ ears; this women ( I think! ) found pleasure in throwing water at me. She then\
  \ asked me in French if I was ok.  Already in a state of shock, all I can respond\
  \ was: \u201Coui, oui\u201D.\nAt that moment I could not stop thinking of Queen\
  \ Latifah on the last Holiday when she was in the spa having a treatment and her\
  \ masseuse starts hitting her with a bunch of leaves, in the movie, Queen Latifah\
  \ gets up her massage table, grabs the bunch off the masseuse s hand and starts\
  \ hitting her instead, very funny in the movie, terrifying in real life!\nNext she\
  \ signals me to lay down, so I do, stomach down, she then proceeds to cover me in\
  \ black soap with a speed that felt more rushed and punishing than relaxing and\
  \ enjoyable, after she was done with my back, she signals me to turn, I do and trying\
  \ to keep my dignity I cover my breasts with my hands. Well, this lady was not having\
  \ it, she almost wrestles me to uncover my lady bits and frankly got way to close\
  \ for comfort to the bits below my stomach, I was mortified and already unable to\
  \ enjoy the treatment, I decided to just let her finish the  job and hopefully enjoy\
  \ the massage that followed.\nAfter her the marathon effort to smother me in black\
  \ soap, she proceeds to scrub me with the kessa glove at the same speed of \u201C\
  this is not relaxing and can this be over please?  After the scrubbing,  she leaves\
  \ me in the room for a few minutes while the steam filled the room  and became a\
  \ warm and welcomed companion, soon after, she enters and doses me with water again\
  \ and finally hands me my robe and asks me to follow her.\nA massage was supposed\
  \ to follow immediately, instead, she leaves me in a sitting room, gives me some\
  \ tea and then disappears for about 10 minutes before she reapers to take me into\
  \ the massage room.\nAt this point I was stressed, disappointed and wanting the\
  \ experience to be over. No surprise that the massage was as short and as disappointing\
  \ as the hammam itself. Although, less traumatic.\nOnce the treatment was over,\
  \ I changed, paid and left as quickly as I could to get ready for a group dinner.\
  \ During dinner, I was sharing my hammam experience with the group a few them and\
  \ they just burst into laughter, telling me how they just had the most marvelous\
  \ same but different experience at the Mamounia hotel.  As they recount their experience\
  \ there, I immediately regret my decision to not go with them that day. They had\
  \ invited me, but I decided to stay behind and go to the Medina early in the day\
  \ and have the treatment in the hotel that afternoon instead, but in true travel\
  \ reasoning, I can always use this experience as an excuse to return to Marrakesh\
  \ and have a proper and relaxing hammam treatment @ The Mamounia"
