Text: "Don't say a word. Don't move. Don't breath. Above all, don't think! Listen\
  \ to your heartbeat. Just feel it, the town's life. Now you start to understand\
  \ the meaning of 'anthropomorphic'. The town is a person. You feel his fingers all\
  \ over your skin, couldn't be more alive. You get the moods, you recognize the scents,\
  \ the noises. It's the closest thing to intimacy since the last time you became\
  \ intimate with someone.\n\nOne of my favorite writers Azar Nafisi once said that\
  \ when you're a tourist you see the beauty of a place. When you actually live there\
  \ and you start loving that place you start to criticize it because you start understanding\
  \ its issues, its ugliness and you feel legitimate to want to make it better.\n\n\
  I came from night-life Bucharest, Romania to noisy Rome, Italy to quiet Fabrica\
  \ di Roma. While working in the erotic massage I met an Italian man and shortly\
  \ after followed him at his birth-nation. Yes, Italians are noisy, yes, some of\
  \ them gesticulate a lot, yes, the breakfast with Cornetto and Espresso is divine\
  \ and yes, Italians do it better. Some made me feel I was home, some haven't. Unfortunately,\
  \ there's always a category to hate.\n\nDoing erotic massage means reaching a bizarre\
  \ level of intimacy with people. You get naked shortly after you meet them. You\
  \ literally feel their essence. Oddly, it's not just about money and handjobs, it's\
  \ about trust and about understanding people's needs. And even if is not the most\
  \ honorable profession in the world,  something sticks with you: the desire to know\
  \ people and things better, to go beyond the surface, beyond the pleasantries and\
  \ the meaningless chit-chat. \n\nI won a scholarship for screenwriting lessons and\
  \ fell in love with my professor. He was looking for the essence of things too.\
  \ He never talked about politics, he preferred to talk about love and philosophy\
  \ and books and music and so, Italy felt already different. It wasn't anymore about\
  \ pasta and  Laura Pausini - the things that are more obvious to an untrained eye\
  \ - Italy was culture, was the beauty of the language expressed in the most enjoyable\
  \ activities on Earth: arts and sex. \n\nBut Italy didn't let me rest. It wasn't\
  \ enough anymore. He wasn't enough anymore. I felt The urge, the feeling that is\
  \ something more out there.  Did you ever experience the sensation that you would\
  \ feel accomplished everywhere and with anyone except where and with whom you are\
  \ right now? There is so much history behind us. In Italy, I see the history on\
  \ every corner, on every step I take.\n\nAncient tombs, ancient buildings, ancient\
  \ towns, ancient rats. And you feel that nothing will ever last in time the way\
  \ that lasted the things that the Romans built, but you do your best to follow that\
  \ urge because there is so much future too.\n\nAnd you are aware that one day your\
  \ present will become the past in the future.\nSo I went out there searching for\
  \ nothing in particular, finding something. I found love. A different Italian love.\
  \ One that storytells the world for a living using intelligent articulated words\
  \ because for him words matter. With a warm voice, he speaks about Rome at night\
  \ at the end of June when it's not so hot yet and he walks on the streets maybe\
  \ eating a slice of Pizza and Mortadella buying some for the crowd of homeless people\
  \ that surround the main train station Stazione Termini, buying the newspapers,\
  \ enjoying it and then returning to his wife.\n\nHe made me love politics, understand\
  \ politics and its influence on people's lives and that the world is much bigger\
  \ than my Zip code. Curiosity is the key that opens the lock where the knowledge\
  \ is kept.  For me he is Italy and now I say his name: Giovanni Giovanni, maybe\
  \ far away I will be a man's country."
