Text: "\u201CMa\u2019am, I will be passing by an ancient Shiva temple soon. Would\
  \ you like to stop for a short break there?\u201D asked Vikram.\n\u201CSure!\u201D\
  \ I said, excitedly as I looked at the tired faces of my husband. The journey from\
  \ Mumbai was unexciting and a stopover to stretch ourselves after almost 5 hours\
  \ in a bus on the road was definitely what we needed.\n\u201CArre bhai! Kaun sa\
  \ raasta Gondeshwar ke liye? (Hey brother, which road leads to Gondeshwar?)\u201D\
  \ Vikram asked a pedestrian walking along the narrow road while manoeuvring his\
  \ 12-seater bus. Clearly, he had not taken many visitors there.\n\u201CMa\u2019\
  am, this temple is beautiful. I only bring my guests here if they like ancient Indian\
  \ history. This temple is very old\u201D Vikram explained as the bus entered another\
  \ narrow road with pedestrians guiding our bus to the temple.\nAfter a short drive,\
  \ the road widened and Vikram opened the bus door and said, \u201Cma\u2019am, can\
  \ get down here\u201D\nWhen I stepped down from the bus, I walked a short distance\
  \ to the entrance of the temple structure. The crumbling walls of the entrance was\
  \ just the beginning. Stepping down from the entrance, there was a courtyard with\
  \ an uneven stone pathway leading to the main temple platform. As I walked, the\
  \ approaching views of the main stairway leading to the main temple kept me captivated\
  \ until I reached the main entry point of the temple. There, laid before my eyes,\
  \ was the most beautiful ancient temple I had seen. It was, literally, in the middle\
  \ of nowhere and was not what I expected to find at such a remote location.\nI walked\
  \ slowly towards the main temples, soaking in the discovery which I had just made.\
  \ At the foot of the stairs, I noticed that the temple structure was made entirely\
  \ from black stone, which was a locally sourced material. There were several steps\
  \ which brought us to a single raised platform. On the platform, there was the main\
  \ temple, strategically located at the centre of the platform with five smaller\
  \ temples surrounding the main temple. The largest temple was dedicated to Lord\
  \ Shiva. The smaller five temples were dedicated Lord Ganesh, Lord Vishnu, Lord\
  \ Surya and Goddess Parvati. At every temple structure, there were exquisite carvings\
  \ depicting stories from the Puranas, Mahabharat and Ramayana. As I gently glided\
  \ my fingers along the figurine of a woman, I imagined the craftsmen with their\
  \ chisels and hammers creating such beautiful artwork. There was perfection and\
  \ symmetry at every carved sculpture. The skilled craftsmen would have been proud\
  \ to see their artwork had survived centuries of exposure to the elements and ravages\
  \ of nature.\nAs we were exploring the temple grounds, we observed that the local\
  \ community had been taking care of the temple by maintaining its cleanliness whilst\
  \ the ample grounds were used as a playground. The smaller temple of Lord Ganesh\
  \ was used for prayers, making this temple a living temple.\nThe atmosphere was\
  \ that of tranquillity and stillness. It was, as if, time had stood still. Time,\
  \ being a continued measure of events and the events surrounding this temple was\
  \ that of change. Change had come in the form of development. There were highways,\
  \ residential areas and not far from the temple, I could see huge windmills, which\
  \ were used to generate electricity for the surrounding towns and villages. It was\
  \ then, that, I could only imagine the temple in its glory. The flurry of activities\
  \ with devotees in colourful sari\u2019s carrying trays with offerings of flowers,\
  \ coconuts and sweets coming to offer prayers to the Lord Almighty. The prayers\
  \ could be for a better harvest or a thanksgiving on the birth of a newborn. The\
  \ devotees would have first offered prayers at the Lord Ganesh temple as he is the\
  \ remover of obstacles before moving on to the next time and finally, reaching the\
  \ inner sanctum of Lord Shiva\u2019s temple. \n\u201CMa\u2019am, we have to go.\
  \ Or we will reach Shirdi late at night\u201D, Vikram said as he ushered me into\
  \ the bus. As Vikram drove out, the glimpses of the temple became distant, yet the\
  \ memories stayed with me forever."
