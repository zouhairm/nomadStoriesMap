Text: "Travel ou trip? For non-native speakers, they try to find out the difference\
  \ between these two words, bus the most important thing is just go! When we are\
  \ planning a trip, we think how perfect it would be the good vibes, the atmosphere\
  \ and learn the local culture. The last one is more important, but don\u2019t let\
  \ it to find out there, google it for not pass through embarrassment moment.\n\n\
  I\u2019ve been abroad, my first travel without family, friends, no one. My destiny?\
  \ Ireland, more specific in Dublin the capital, the friendliest country in Europe,\
  \ this was the results of my research, today I agree with it, because they were\
  \ very kind, I don\u2019t have complaint about them. The host family helped me with\
  \ house move, when I got lost, people from streets helped me, they trusted me. My\
  \ first impressions were good.\n\nLet\u2019s talk about my favorite subject: food,\
  \ I love trying all sort of food, mainly in other country, but I didn\u2019t realize\
  \ how different they were! Let\u2019s start with breakfast, for me, it\u2019s look\
  \ like lunch, they eat bacon, sausages, baked beans, eggs, mushrooms, grilled tomatoes,\
  \ and perhaps some cooked leftover potatoes, and about Irish coffee is a cocktail\
  \ consisting of hot coffee, Irish whiskey, and sugar, stirred, and topped with cream\u2026\
  \ Cheers! At lunch is a fast food, and for dinner a soup. Other traditional is fish\
  \ and fries, like the name say is fish surrounded by fries, it\u2019s very tasty.\n\
  \nDo you know they love drinking? The law there is very strict, you can\u2019t drink\
  \ alcohol drinks outside pubs, my old teacher told me that even in funeral they\
  \ drink, because everyone present will celebrate the life of the deceased by drinking.\
  \ The deceased is the center of the conversation, where people will remember as\
  \ positive stories. As the day progresses and as people become more affected by\
  \ alcohol, celebrations can become more lively, with music and singing. Food included\
  \ (sandwiches and snacks), and even paid for by the family of the deceased. However,\
  \ everyone buys their own drink.\n\nAs I told you, I was there alone, I stayed in\
  \ a host family for two weeks, that\u2019s enough to find a job and a place to move,\
  \ my visa gave me the permission to stay for eight months, and continues in a host\
  \ family was expensive, of course a had a perk, breakfast and dinner were cooked\
  \ by them, they washed my clothes they treat me like a son, and I confess that I\
  \ was loving it. Not always a bed of roses, at school, I heard that was very difficult\
  \ to find a job and a place to live. There were lots of scam rent an apartment,\
  \ we had need to pay attention and try to find a big deal. Even to get a job was\
  \ a bit hard, simple jobs like cleaner or kitchen porter they were looking for a\
  \ fluent in English person.\n\nUnforeseen occurred, but if a have money I would\
  \ do it again, the experience was wonderful. You can ask me: \u201CSo you will finish\
  \ this text, but why did you come back? If you really enjoyed, why didn\u2019t you\
  \ stay there?\u201D Calm down, I explain why, first when you are far from you house,\
  \ You missed your family and friends, in Brazil I have a Bachelor in Ireland I needed\
  \ to reboot my live a restart my career. Of course, I\u2019d like to come back and\
  \ make this again, but now I have experience and I\u2019ll do it but in other conditions."
