  \ for visit Places with me, so i decide make a trip by myself to Brugge, one of\
  \ the Places that always i sais i will visit. I take the trainer ay 8:00 am , and\

  \  where go to a guy that was stand next to a big map in station. He explain me\
  \ everything very professional and immediately we feel a conection , then we walked\
  \ together until the principal plaza. He bought me a waffle and we still talking\
