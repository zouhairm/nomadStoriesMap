Text: "I was in Mandalay once more, stuck in one of the least likeable and most polluted\
  \ cities I\u2019ve been to so far because I had hurt my foot and could barely walk.\
  \ This was a problem I had already grown accustomed to on this trip, but it didn\u2019\
  t change the fact that I still resented the city. It was hot, the scenery was disappointing,\
  \ and it smelled of diesel. My first impressions should have served as forewarning:\
  \ trains inbound to Mandalay would pass ugly \u2013 though rather organized \u2013\
  \ heaps of trash along the tracks. The first pile was canvas bags, followed by used\
  \ jeans, then rubber tyres, and so on. So much for that enigmatic Oriental allure\
  \ the name \u2018Mandalay\u2019 had evoked.\n\nIndeed, I was glad to be leaving\
  \ Mandalay again, headed north to Indawgyi Lake, despite the 15-hour train ride\
  \ that lay between me and what I hoped to be paradise. I loved trains anyway, and\
  \ long train rides especially. Plus, being on a train meant that I could rest my\
  \ injured foot, yet I wasn\u2019t \u201Cwasting time\u201D doing nothing since there\u2019\
  s always activity buzzing about on trains in Southeast Asia. And at the end of it\
  \ all, I get a lake all to myself. \u201CWhat a brilliant plan!\u201D I thought,\
  \ smiling smugly to myself.\n\nOn board and comfy, we departed and passed the organized\
  \ piles of trash, untouched and unchanged over the last few days of course. The\
  \ escape was underway! Mandalay\u2019s urban sprawl continued for an hour as the\
  \ train dragged itself along, but we did eventually reach the juncture where the\
  \ tracks split, riding rails that veered northward toward Myitkyina instead of following\
  \ the tracks south to Yangon. It didn\u2019t take long before it was evident that\
  \ the tracks here aren\u2019t the best maintained. On a particularly bad section\
  \ of track, the side to side sway of the train was so strong that I had to hold\
  \ on to the armrests of my seat. I was genuinely amazed we didn\u2019t derail! There\
  \ were hazards that came from within too \u2013 at one point, the sways were so\
  \ strong that a huge canvas sack of fruits that one passenger chucked into the overhead\
  \ luggage rack had fallen off.\n\nAs the sun fell and night arrived, a storm brewed\
  \ around the train. Strong gusts of wind signalled its arrival, blowing the midday\
  \ stuffiness out of the carriage, but the vacuum was soon filled as the first drops\
  \ of rain started to fall. Everyone went into a frenzied scramble to shut the metal\
  \ window shades before more rain could come in. A particular window shade a few\
  \ rows behind me was stuck; it was slightly dislodged from its groove and refused\
  \ to budge. Just then, a member of staff on board walked down the aisle: his uniform\
  \ shirt was only half-buttoned, and his pants and slippers quite well worn. He slid\
  \ out of his slippers and gestured apologetically to the passenger before stepping\
  \ onto her seat. She inched forward so his feet wouldn\u2019t touch her back. After\
  \ a minute of trying, he jumped off the seat and left, reappearing not long after\
  \ with a hammer in hand. A few hard knocks later, the window shade finally relented,\
  \ but by then the rain was already lighter. At least the carriage was cool, verging\
  \ on chilly. The heat from Mandalay was gone.\n\nThe temperature was now perfect\
  \ for sleeping. Some passengers unfurled rattan mats between the rows of seats,\
  \ others along the aisle \u2013 all equally unperturbed by the possibility that\
  \ someone would step on them by accident during the night. It was a sense of not\
  \ only indifference, but also of trust that people have a good enough sense of balance\
  \ to neither trip over their body nor step on their faces. As for me, I was satisfied\
  \ with dozing off on my seat and I slept surprisingly well as the train rocked,\
  \ awaking a few times during the night, and then again after dawn. It was slow going,\
  \ but we already in Kachin state. Indawgyi was within reach, and I could already\
  \ smell the fresh air."
