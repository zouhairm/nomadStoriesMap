  \n(-Volovanes, take your hot volovanes! Do you want a volov\xE1n? I have of pineapple,\
  \ ham and cheese, tuna, chorizo and manjar.)\n\nIt\u2019s 8 in the morning and the\
  \ sound of voices overlapping begin to infiltrate my bedroom through the small spaces\
  \ between the blinds of my window and the wall. If it weren\u2019t for those voices\
  \ announcing hot volovanes and atole for breakfast, or shouting one another what\
  \ a nice weather does today, I wouldn\u2019t have noticed it had already dawned.\n\
  \nIt\u2019s through these voices that I know today is Monday.\n\nYesterday the alley\
  \ was different. Yesterday the alley was quiet.\n\nYesterday the Gonz\xE1lez Ortega\
  \ alley in Xalapa, Veracruz, seemed to have been a narrow space filled with family\
  \ houses and a homelike feeling permeating the air. An old paved alley, an old library\
  \ full of memories; the streetlamps giving life to the old houses\u2019 facades.\n\
  \nThere, in the corners and the spaces between the stones of those buildings, remain\
  \ the stories of lovers forced apart, of murders driven by greed and lust, of promises\
  \ of eternal love made under the moonlight, of unspeakable secrets told in a very\
  \ low voice. Some stones even tell about a secret wealth hidden under one of the\
  \ houses, but, who is there that really knows?\n\nHowever, everything changes. The\
  \ alley today is the alley of Mondays: loud voices discussing from 8 in the morning\
  \ until 2 in the afternoon if the government latest decision was the right one or\
  \ not. I open the windows; I stand on the balcony by the door.\n\nTo my right there\u2019\
  s a non-Italian restaurant whose main dish is pizza, there\u2019s Marta\u2019s house\
  \ where she's been living since the times of the alley of yesterday, there\u2019\
  s a kindergarten filled with the screams of children playing on the slide having\
  \ fun. The alley extends all the way through the next street, narrowing even more\
  \ at some places challenging the best of drivers when driving through.\n\nIn the\
  \ narrowest point, Marta created a beautiful mural of a killer whale made of recycled\
  \ mirrors and colourful plates in the memory of her late son. When the sunlight\
  \ reflects on the pieces of mirror the killer whale comes to life.\n\nIt\u2019s\
  \ even more of a challenge to drive by and not to damage her offering. Correction.\
  \ It\u2019s more of a moral responsibility.\n\nTo my left there\u2019s a small park\
  \ that leads to the entrance of a bar that from 6 in the evening until 2 in the\
  \ morning brings in hundreds of people that don\u2019t know anything about old family\
  \ houses or homelike feelings, but know only about loud midnight \u201Cwhat happened\
  \ last night\u201D conversations. The volume of the music wouldn\u2019t give them\
  \ any other option.\n\nIt\u2019s in that park where I see him. The middle age man\
  \ sitting on a side of a small garden. He sits down to take a rest from the 4 in\
  \ the evening sun. The man whistles, I watch. The man stops. He turns his head to\
  \ the barber shop across the alley looking at something, I can\u2019t tell what.\
  \ His burden is huge, what I really mean is his load. I wondered what he is thinking.\n\
  \nWho is willing to buy brooms, dustpans and scrubbing brushes from a pedlar? How\
  \ many brooms does he sell every day? Does he come from far away? How far away?\
  \ How does the world look like through his eyes? I can\u2019t help to wonder.\n\n\
  We are not used to buy brooms from him anymore, all we need is available at those\
  \ big supermarkets.\n\nThe world has changed and with it, its customs. The organilleros\
  \ cannot be found in the streets anymore, the old ice-cream pedlars have been replaced\
  \ with certain brands in stores. The whistle of the knife sharpener is no longer\
  \ heard. Apparently, they are no longer needed.\n\nThe man stands up, whistling\
  \ he lifts up his load and with a song he returns to work selling his vendibles.\
  \ \u201CBrooms! Floorclothes and brooms!\u201D, he yells. I hope somebody purchases\
  \ a broom.\n\nI still can hear his song."
