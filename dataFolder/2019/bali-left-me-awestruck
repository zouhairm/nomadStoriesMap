Text: "Although I am Indonesian, it felt like I haven\u2019t had a connection with\
  \ the culture and tradition that my ancestors have paved the way for. Since my family\
  \ & I live abroad we only have a chance to visit our country twice a year because\
  \ we were trying to save up our money.In the year 2017 we visited Lombok, a tropical\
  \ place known for its marvelous beaches that could leave people in awe.I had low\
  \ expectations & hopes coming in here but this place offered me more than that,\
  \ i was taught about the culture and the delicious food that I couldn\u2019t stay\
  \ away from and eventually gained 5kg since we were inseparable. After touring around\
  \ Lombok for about a week we packed our bags and rushed to Bali with excitement\
  \ and our anticipation was as high as the Burj Khalifa in Dubai.Bali is an unforgettable\
  \ place and the memories that was forged and created there left me with a warm feeling\
  \ of wanting to go back there for the sake of experiencing every single thing all\
  \ over again.What I\u2019ve noticed was that most of the Balinese were religious\
  \ people that placed a temple size ranging from small to big right infront of their\
  \ houses or workplace.Every morning they would set out flowers and food as an offering\
  \ and I\u2019ve come to the point that I had so much respect for these people, not\
  \ only them but also its history and authentic dishes.That summer was the epitome\
  \ of my happiness and it reminded me of how much i want my family to be as close\
  \ as we were on that trip."
