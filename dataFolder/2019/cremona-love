Text: "Loves of my life: a small Italian city, and a high school boy. I loved Cremona\
  \ because he was there\u2014my first crush. We meandered down the quaint streets,\
  \ fingers laced, with the language of love on our lips, our souls light. The moon\
  \ kissed the cobblestones and lingered in our eyes, as the sweet music of a classical\
  \ Strata Verdi violin sewed sweet melodies in our wake. Part of the high school\
  \ orchestra, we were never alone, but even the conductor knew of our courtship.\
  \ During our concerts, we sat at opposite ends of the group; perfect for gazing\
  \ into each other\u2019s eyes, not caring if the audience saw our affection. \n\t\
  That all changed once we reached Rome. His soft touch and impeccable blue eyes rarely\
  \ caressed my face and our long strolls through the historic architecture of the\
  \ city ceased. His swagger penetrated the crowded streets, received by Italian women\
  \ with exotic hearts and flirtatious hips. I ate gelato alone, and glared as his\
  \ big feet strode toward other women; their smiles dismissed my dreams of our would-be\
  \ first kiss\u2014the Trevi Fountain as our backdrop. \n\tI sulked to the market\
  \ with friends, when an old man greeted us outside the door. He sat stooped, a glass\
  \ bottle of water in one hand, cigarette in the other. His dark beard hid everything\
  \ but two bright eyes under graying brows. A hand rose in salutation, his charmingly\
  \ gruff voice said, \"ciao\" to each of us. My friend\u2019s bright voices replied\
  \ in turn, until I brought up the rear, and the man\u2019s eyes met mine. \"Ciao\
  \ Bella,\" he smiled. Startled by the kind greeting, my trudging halted. Slowly,\
  \ my back straightened, a smile twitched on my lips. I replied, \"ciao,\" and walked\
  \ into the market, my eyes vibrant with the beauty of Rome."
