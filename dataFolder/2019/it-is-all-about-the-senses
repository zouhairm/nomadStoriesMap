Text: "By nature, every human has 5 senses: taste, sight, touch, smell and hearing.\
  \ It is interesting that when you start to recall the travel experiences you had,\
  \ you don\u2019t remember the places, attractions or people, you just remember specific\
  \ moments when the mixture of senses was rich. Despite having seen dozens of countries\
  \ and cities, the most memorable trip for me is still the very first one. The mix\
  \ of smells, noise and taste I experienced during that trip as a little girl will\
  \ stay with me for my entire life. \n\nThe first ever travel experience in my life\
  \ was traveling to my grandparents. They lived in a village and we used to travel\
  \ there by car. Road to their place goes through the Uighur village: people running\
  \ around to sell us fruits and vegetables once our car stops for a small break,\
  \ smell of wet soil that is watered to increase humidity in during a hot day, cafes\
  \ with names of Uighur women and a smell of pepper. When you pass by those intrusive\
  \ sellers and enter the noisy cafes, first of all, you feel the smell of spicy pepper\
  \ which Uighurs add to \u201Clagman\u201D (traditional pasta/noodles with meat and\
  \ vegetable sauce). Even though those road cafes are far from being clean and flies\
  \ are circling all around, one cannot resist but order a portion of tasty lagman\
  \ there. The noise of flies mixed with a loud Uighur speech could not distract us\
  \ from the big pot of freshly cooked lagman once you take a fork and turn it to\
  \ \u201Cwind up\u201D those noodles. After you are done with noodles bring a pot\
  \ to mouth to drink the delicious spicy sauce-soup. The lagman sauce, made from\
  \ meat and mix of fresh vegetables of different colors which were fried just for\
  \ several minutes to be kept crispy and juicy, brings a feel of utter bliss to your\
  \ taste receptors. This soup makes you feel hot inside and your tongue burn from\
  \ all the spices, but it makes all the fatigue from a long trip disappear once and\
  \ you are all ready to continue the trip further.\n\nFresh wind from the mountains\
  \ with a smell of grass follows us all the way until we reach grandparents\u2019\
  \ house. For me houses in villages have their own charm \u2013 noise of cows and\
  \ sheep, barking dogs and singing birds, smell of cattle, freshly cut grass and\
  \ burnt wood and all of that felt at the same time. Usually in addition to that\
  \ blend you also feel a smell of freshly cooked bread and a smell of smoke from\
  \ samovar (container used to boil water for tea). After a long road a smell of bread\
  \ and warm from samovar give you a feeling that you have been waited for the whole\
  \ day and water in samovar was even boiled several times to meet you with a hot\
  \ tea. And this hospitality and coziness make you feel like an ice melting under\
  \ sunlight. Hot tea with milk, fresh cooked bread, which is crispy outside and super\
  \ soft flesh inside, and a homemade butter or sour cream make up the tastiest breakfast\
  \ in your life and for sure it is incomparable to what you have tried in the best\
  \ restaurants. \n\nI will remember my first travel experience for the whole life\
  \ because traveling is not about the distance, places or attractions, but about\
  \ your feelings and senses having been triggered during that time. And I know for\
  \ sure that even if I come to the same place it is not possible to feel the same\
  \ emotions again - the mix of smell, taste and noise will never be the same."
