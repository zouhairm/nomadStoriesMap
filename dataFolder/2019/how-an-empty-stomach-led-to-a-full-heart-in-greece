Text: "\u201COh my gosh\u2026 I would have DIED!\u201D\n\n\u201CYou are crazy.\u201D\
  \ \n\nThese are just two of the several comments I received when I had mentioned\
  \ that I had embarked on a 15-kilometer hike on a 91-degree day in Crete, Greece.\n\
  \nWhile I would like to claim that this was all eloquently thought out, planned,\
  \ and prepared for\u2026 the truth of the story is my LACK of planning ended up\
  \ manifesting into a magical 3-day hike through a gorge and along the southern coast\
  \ -- with a hefty dose of intermittent fasting.\n\nYa see the thing is - the night\
  \ before I was meant to leave on the said hike, I met a travel friend out for a\
  \ drink. \n\nKeyword: \u201Ca drink\u201D.\n\nHa.\n\nJokes on me because 3 wines\
  \ later and a 3:30 am bedtime left me far away from feeling like I could function\
  \ as a human.\n\nBut nature was calling my name.\n\nI peeled myself out of bed...\
  \ and off I went to catch the 7:45 am bus. I got to the bus station with minutes\
  \ to spare, leaving me absolutely no time to buy anything. \n\nIt was just me and\
  \ my bottle of water. \n\nI did have the opportunity to stop at a market at the\
  \ beginning of the Samaria Gorge\u2026 but in my sleep-deprived daze I sauntered\
  \ past it figuring, \u201Ceh, I\u2019ll be ok.\u201D \n\nWhile the beginning of\
  \ the trek was a bit of hobbling along, once I was into the third hour, I felt light\
  \ as a feather and FULL of energy! I even felt so great I was singing Disney songs\
  \ to entertain myself.\n\nIt was nearly 3 in the afternoon by the time I reached\
  \ my destination in a coastal village that I finally sat down for my first meal\
  \ of the day. And the truth is, even after the 4.5-hour hike on an empty stomach,\
  \ I still felt like I had enough power to keep on going -- I felt as if nothing\
  \ could hold me back or weigh me down! \n\nThe next morning as I embarked on the\
  \ second day of my adventure, I decided to \u201Cjust get started\u201D again even\
  \ though I knew I wouldn\u2019t have an opportunity to eat along the way. As I trotted\
  \ along I couldn\u2019t help but notice how clean and clear I felt. \n\nWithout\
  \ my body having to focus on digestion, I felt like all of my body\u2019s energy\
  \ could go into propelling me further along the trail.\n\nI arrived at an even smaller\
  \ coastal village after my 5-hour hike and as I sat down to eat, the gentleman who\
  \ was taking my order said, \u201CYou strong woman!\u201D as I shared with him my\
  \ day\u2019s adventures.\n\nAnd STRONG indeed I felt! \n\nOn the third and final\
  \ day of my hike, I once again hit the trail on an empty stomach and something magical\
  \ happened about 2 hours in.  I was staring out at the sparkling turquoise sea and\
  \ I became filled with EMOTION. \n\nWhat the heck? Where was this coming from? \n\
  \nAnd then they came.\n\nTears.\n\nTears of joy, gratitude, and happiness rolled\
  \ down my cheeks. My heart beat a bit faster and I just felt LOVE. Love for this\
  \ life and everything in it. It was one of those moments where all was right in\
  \ the world.\n\nThe only word I have to describe the way I was feeling is PURE.\
  \ My mind, my thoughts, my body, my environment\u2026 everything felt so pure!\n\
  \nI knew going into this adventure that my body would be challenged with all of\
  \ the walking, climbing, and dealing with the heat. However, what I didn\u2019t\
  \ anticipate was how my unplanned fasting during this journey would beautifully\
  \ enhance this experience. \n\nIt was a challenge on top of a challenge - and I\
  \ love me a good challenge! But in the end, it ended up feeling so natural and effortless\
  \ because my body was showing me that it was enjoying its vacation from food.\n\n\
  In the end, my body loved it, my mind loved it, and my spirit loved it. \n\n\u201C\
  Yamas\u201D! (aka CHEEEEEERS in Greek)."
