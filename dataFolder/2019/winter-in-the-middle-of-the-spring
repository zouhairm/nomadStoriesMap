Text: "Some cities are beautiful only in one kind of weather while others can open\
  \ up various worlds depending on the mood of the clouds. Tirana is a challenge when\
  \ it is raining. But you can see the city so clearly, the rain has such a purifying\
  \ effect in this city that is almost as if you see it for the first time. The challenge\
  \ is facing the people with umbrellas, no one wants to get wet and they are always\
  \ in an unnecessary hurry. And the wind, at times can be so strong that choses the\
  \ path for you. But the colors of the city are worth it. Tirana is colorful, numerous\
  \ streets have Picasso like buildings, even some of the institutions. There are\
  \ trees in different color in the main boulevards. Also, the electric cabins are\
  \ painted in various cartoon characters. Under the cloudy sky these colors are so\
  \ vivid, like each piece of Tirana wants to tell a story, about its people and how\
  \ they never stop moving, always energetic.  \n\nThis kind of Tirana was expected\
  \ for this Summer Day. Summer Day is the 14th of March, and it is a national Holiday\
  \ in Albania. Although is in the middle of the spring, is a pagan ritual passed\
  \ down from our ancestors the Illyrians. Our forefathers marked this day as a welcoming\
  \ feast for summer, which in this country is said to be when you see the first martin.\
  \ And when you see it, you have to take a specific action. In your wrist you would\
  \ have a bracelet, delicately made from red and white threads. The moment you are\
  \ lucky enough to se the martin, you have to cut your bracelet and hang it in the\
  \ nearest tree, preferably an olive tree. The day you put the bracelet on, is exactly\
  \ the Summer Day. And on this day we eat this sweet, locally called, \u201CBallokume\u201D\
  , it is like an enormous cookie made with butter and corn flower. But surprisingly\
  \ it tastes fresh, almost like summer is just around the corner. \n\nOh, on this\
  \ day is like a divine prophecy is always so sunny and so warm. Tirana becomes like\
  \ a rock star, music stages build in almost every other crossroad, where various\
  \ forms of live performances are held. The main boulevards are turned pedestrian\
  \ and you can see people enjoying themselves, with some cold drink in their hands.\
  \ This year Tirana will se a rainy Summer Day, but no worries the Mayor postponed\
  \ all the partying on Sunday, when there will be sunshine of the charts! \n\nThere\
  \ is another legend with March. This story also explains why the February month\
  \ is so short. According to what they have taught us, when March came, Spring would\
  \ be everywhere, setting the good mood of people, flowers in each road, sun and\
  \ warmth. So, an old lady, decided to enjoy this wonderful weather! She went on\
  \ top of the mountain, and was sunbathing. March got annoyed of the cheeky old lady\
  \ and had an idea. He decided to talk with his brother February and this is what\
  \ he said: \u201CFebruary, dear brother, please loan me a couple of days so I can\
  \ make this old lady feel sorry for being so cheeky when I am here.\u201D And February,\
  \ agreed to give a couple of days to his brother March. March on the other hand\
  \ had such cold days that all dreams of spring were forgotten and of course the\
  \ old lady felt very sorry for her adventuring wishes, chilled to the bone on top\
  \ of the mountain. And these are locally known as the Old Ladies\u2019, a winter\
  \ in the middle of the spring."
