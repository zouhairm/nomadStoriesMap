Text: "Seoul subway stations have names that resemble to me as the names of mitical\
  \ creatures. Itaewon, Beotigogoae, Anam and Dongmyo are some of them. But it was\
  \ in one called Cheonggu, when I found my angel.\n\nBeing teased because of my weight\
  \ in the exigent Korean society, I felt sick of going to do shopping and not find\
  \ anything my size, or to be stared upon by the local sellers who told me that they\
  \ had nothing for me. I was 70 kilos and 1,60m which was slightly over the suggested\
  \ weight for someone my height. \"It's Asia, afterall\", was what I told myself.\
  \ But every time I began feeling unattractive, strange, a paria.\n\nI went to see\
  \ a weight loss Korean doctor, who introduced me to the world of keto, and gave\
  \ me a full box of traditional Korean medicine aimed to reduce my appetite. I felt\
  \ relieved after feeling that my 'obesity' days were over. So, I got into Cheonggu\
  \ station with the unconfortable stare of people who stared at my box of medicine,\
  \ ready to start.\n\nIn the Korean society, it is okay to say you are trying to\
  \ lose weight. So I was forcing myself to believe it was okay, they were not judging\
  \ me untill someone kept staring me with a sad, but intense face. It was an ajumma.\
  \ Ajummas are the most feared members of the Korean society. Due to the Confucianism\
  \ that still rules, the eldest are the most respected. She approached and told me\
  \ \"you are not fat\". As my Korean is not good yet, I struggled to understand what\
  \ she was saying, yet she kept trying to mix the few words in English she knew.\
  \ \"You are beautiful. You are not fat\", she kept saying. Everyone else kept staring\
  \ while I wanted to faint. \"Who pays for this? Your husband? Is your husband Korean?\
  \ He is silly. Tell me his number and I will tell him not to do this to you\". Then,\
  \ I realized that she was an angel. No, I had paid for the treatment, and I wanted\
  \ thisnfor myself, but to hear these empowering words and attempt for helping me\
  \ was all I needed. \n\nI just told her \"it's okay, thanks\", while kept carrying\
  \ that box. \n\nI lost weight after that, and reached a healthy level, but still\
  \ remember that lady telling me I was beautiful and think that, despite the society,\
  \ women support themselves regardless language or cultural stereotypes."
