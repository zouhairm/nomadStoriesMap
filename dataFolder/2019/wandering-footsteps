Text: "In the era of business and busy ness there is lot to see around in the world\
  \ I would like to share my story of travelling in nearby places in India it has\
  \ a lots of prosperity around my trip started with unexpected call from my school.\
  \ Friend who hadn\u2019t contacted me since we separated he directly said we are\
  \ going on a trip to Hampi and there the best the sun was glowing the same as there\
  \ was glow on my face we decided to go to jamli with vehicle but then in car while\
  \ we were still yet to go we decided one more exciting that to travel in Hampi not\
  \ by car but by bicycles to make such places pollution free. Then that morning we\
  \ went to hampi with friends like journey begin with a great song on Radio mirchi\
  \ 98.3 FM and the RJ was like ki \u201CHey guys!! Are you enjoying today??\u201D\
  \ We were like yeah The whole journey we played lot of games in the car like singing\
  \ together and alone for a while then we played word games while we parked in public\
  \ places as we were total 4 boys so we started starring at girls then we again ignited\
  \ our engines and reached hampi..... We were 226 miles away from home but we were\
  \ connected to our homes everyone called home we reached and then we planned out\
  \ some spots and we had taken our cycles so we each one rode to that place and enjoy\
  \ the scerene and made some cool photography and tried to remember each of it....\
  \ The tones there made me mesmerising and addicted towards it As we were fed up\
  \ of our busy schedules we made lots of fun by first step on such location we use\
  \ to keep phones shut and use to remind of school days and then come back to our\
  \ hotels same was the whole we carried out and at last the hard time we were on\
  \ the verge to leave from there we on that day stayed on room that last day and\
  \ saw all the pictures we captured on the trip the next day morning we were at homes\
  \ pretty much sure about schedule and sad about it ended so fast but much happier\
  \ to remind the things we did there....\nAnd still we are making calls to plan but\
  \ it hasn\u2019t been possible from then onwards...\nThat trip reminded me how was\
  \ the situation of being total free it\u2019s that way when you have new places\
  \ around and you have to do it to collect each and every thing but about a particular\
  \ place you cannot go once and have all of it you visit for one then one times you\
  \ will see it from new angle tha each day.....\n\nThank you"
