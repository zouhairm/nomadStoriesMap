Text: "Having visited Aveiro and Porto, I wanted to explore some more of Portugal,\
  \ so I decided to go to Lisbon and Algarve for the Easter Holidays. As always, the\
  \ trip turned out to be very adventurous\u2026\n\nHere, I will tell you about my\
  \ Portugal trip, how I will planne it and how adventurous and fun (as always) will\
  \ be. \n\nI started making more spontaneous trips, diving into the local culture\
  \ and feeling like living in the place that I visit, not just being a regular tourist.\
  \ I still use some tricks to explore the most without an exact plan.\n\nI want I\
  \ booking a bus to can to know around from Portugal and booked a hostel there to\
  \ discover all the cultures of different people. \n\nKnowing a little about local\
  \ customs, especially in restaurants, will help you feel more confident and avoid\
  \ that nasty suspicion that you\u2019ve been ripped off. I will advice on planning\
  \ a trip to Portugal including what to bring, what to expect when eating out and\
  \ how you can save money on accommodation, transport, food, shopping and activities.\n\
  I think important to check travel times and distances between places if you\u2019\
  re considering visiting more than one region. It makes far more sense to take your\
  \ time exploring one area properly and come back again to see another place than\
  \ to spend half your holiday travelling between destinations.\nI will to talk bout\
  \ more and more destinations in Portugal offer a tourist card, such as the Lisbon\
  \ Card and Porto Card, which give free or discounted public transport and discounts\
  \ on all manner of typical holiday expenditures. Certainly, is necessary to check\
  \ before the local tourist information website before you travel to see what\u2019\
  s available and start saving money from the moment you step off the plane.\nI will\
  \ show you the Portugal accommodation guides to help you find a great place to stay\n\
  \nI will to talk about to check that your passport is in date \u2013 you may need\
  \ at least 6 months if coming from outside the EU \u2013 and bring a couple of photocopies\
  \ with you. By law, you have to carry photo ID when in Portugal but won\u2019t want\
  \ to risk losing your precious passport so leave that in your hotel safe and keep\
  \ a photocopy with you and carry some alternative form of  photographic ID like\
  \ a driving licence.\nIf you live in the EU, apply for and bring your European Health\
  \ Insurance Card. It doesn\u2019t substitute full travel insurance but will reduce\
  \ the costs of emergency treatment. If you\u2019re coming from elsewhere, you should\
  \ make sure you have insurance to cover health emergencies as the costs can quickly\
  \ soar. \n\nThe good news is that you don\u2019t need any vaccinations for visiting\
  \ Portugal unless you\u2019re coming from a Yellow Fever zone.\n\nIf you have an\
  \ EU passport, you don\u2019t need a visa to enter Portugal. Other passport holders\
  \ should check Visit Portugal\u2019s guidelines although American, Canadian and\
  \ Australian citizens can travel visa-free for 90 days (total) within the Schengen\
  \ area.\nIf you intend to visit museums and monuments, there are two important things\
  \ to consider. One is that some offer free admission on Sunday mornings or discounts\
  \ with the local tourist card.\n\nThe other is that most are closed on Mondays so\
  \ you\u2019ll need to check and plan around this if you have your heart set on seeing\
  \ something specific.\n\nThat's it! This is a little bit of what you need to know\
  \ before coming to Portugal."
