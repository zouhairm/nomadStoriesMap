Text: "Context:\n[It was mid-January, 2015. I sat peering wistfully out of the office\
  \ window, as I had been doing for some months now. A career in health insurance\
  \ was not for me, and each day that passed this became clearer. How could life be\
  \ this mundane? I was supressing the urge inside to explore, but craved adventure\
  \ like never before. One evening I spoke to my partner and told him that at this\
  \ point in my life, I needed to travel. He was working and finishing his degree,\
  \ so travelling together was not an option, but my longing for adventure had been\
  \ supressed for too long. At 24 years old, I told him I would go to Asia, alone.\
  \ And in the weeks that followed, I handed in my work resignation and bought a one-way\
  \ ticket to Bangkok. \nThe plan had been 2-3 months of backpacking, I felt this\
  \ would be enough to quench my thirst for travel. Fourteen months later, without\
  \ ever looking back, I found myself in Cairns, Australia, waiting to board a sailboat\
  \ headed for the great barrier reef.] \n\n\nI sipped on a coffee watching as the\
  \ harbour came to life with the gentle morning sun. The coastal town of Cairns,\
  \ in tropical North Queensland, has a busy harbour throughout the year, as tourists\
  \ flock from around the world to get a taste of The Great Barrier Reef. The reef\
  \ is experiencing a steep decline in the health of its coral and other marine life,\
  \ due to various factors including pollution, overfishing, and coral bleaching caused\
  \ by global warming. Many divers from across the world will flock here to see (what\
  \ remains of) the reef\u2019s splendour, before it is too late. I was not one of\
  \ those divers. I had never considered diving at this corner of the world, because\
  \ living on the island of Ireland, fringed by the beautiful, wild Atlantic coast\
  \ and with easy access to the warm waters of the Mediterranean, it seemed a little\
  \ unnecessary to venture that far for a different taste of the ocean. But here I\
  \ was. \nI finished my coffee and, as we began boarding the boat, remembered the\
  \ little packet of ginger sweets I had purchased earlier, to avoid sea sickness.\
  \ This would be an overnight trip, many miles from land and I was slightly anxious\
  \ that the nausea which had spoiled my last two dives might return. However, as\
  \ the boat cleared the bay, it was clear that the weather was in our favour; the\
  \ ocean\u2019s surface was still and we glided effortlessly over a glass pane of\
  \ brilliant blue. \nSome three hours later, the boat slowed and we dropped anchor.\
  \ I peered over the edge for a better look at what might linger below the surface.\
  \ The water sparkled, silhouettes of different fish became visible and suddenly\
  \ the mysterious world below became so much more appealing than the dry calm on\
  \ board the boat. The relaxed atmosphere of the group changed to excitement as we\
  \ were briefed on the dive plan and geared up. Visibility in the water was over\
  \ sixty metres, we were in for a treat. There was no land anywhere in sight, but\
  \ as we snorkelled just a few metres from the boat, we began to see the edges of\
  \ the coral reef. The sandy depths turned to coral shallows and as I drifted above\
  \ the delicate structures of pink, blue and purple corals, I became aware that I\
  \ was surrounded by the most spectacular array of fish species I had ever witnessed.\
  \ Then a strong realization dawned on me; that if there was a heaven on earth, there\
  \ was no doubt this was it.   \n\nThe exceptional visibility and perfectly calm\
  \ water allowed the divers to explore with ease. This part of the reef was intact\
  \ as far as the eye could see and the experience reassured us, as lovers of the\
  \ ocean, that although pollution and climate change were having a strong impact\
  \ on many corners of the globe, it was not here. This pristine section of the reef\
  \ was intact and we would be fortunate enough to share this little corner of paradise\
  \ with its many inhabitants until the sun\u2019s retreat."
