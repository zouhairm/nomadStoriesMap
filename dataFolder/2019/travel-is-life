Text: I always love travelling and as i compelted my 20's i was like i want to travel
  the world before i die.i have travelled four countries till now but singapore was
  like a heart touching trip for me. Me with my two friends planned a trip to singapore
  and phuket, we had three days in singapore. I always had a dream to have a pic at
  marina bay infinity pool so i booked tje hotel in advance. As we reached singapore
  straight we went to marina bay hotel after we reached there it was like a dream
  comimg true hotel was so beautiful that once u go in u wont come out from the hotel
  till whole day,later i was excited to go for the infinity pool and as i went there
  the mesmerizing view from top of singapore was like more than dream. Singapore casino
  are the best in asia and the casino give u very great feeling.the night life of
  singapore is very cool ,climate is always pleaseant ,unviersal studio is one of
  the best part of singapore.three days was like we never came to know how it completed.i
  was like singapore i can travell whenever someone ask me and after that i travelled
  singapore once again and if ever i get a chance i would love to visit the country.
  I feel singapore is like my hometown.must visit once in a lifetime
