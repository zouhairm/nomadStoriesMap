Text: "Travelling is always my passion to explore new places. My travel bucket is\
  \ full of new adventurous places from different parts of the world. In this story,\
  \  I would like to share my travel experience while pursuing a Masters degree from\
  \ Bangor University UK(https://www.bangor.ac.uk/). It was my dream to spend a year\
  \ of my life in a place surrounded by nature and mountain. Luckily I received the\
  \ merit-based scholarship to fulfill my dreams in the world's best regions by Lonely\
  \ Planet(According to Guardian's 2016).\nBefore arriving at Bangor I made a list\
  \ of where to visit within a year. Thanks to the internet and social media for it.\
  \ My first traveling journey of Bangor started by visiting Snowdonia National Park.\
  \ Since  I was a beginner in hiking so I followed the walking way to climb the mountain.\
  \ It was the first time in my life to visit such a glacier mountain. The view from\
  \ the mountain is stunning. I can remember it was a very cold day but I enjoyed\
  \ a lot. The place is quite closer to my accommodation so whenever I want to go\
  \ hiking I can go. Every month we went for a group tour there. I can say, Snowdon\
  \ is my first love at Bangor. \nThe mountain and green view can't satisfy me fully\
  \ as I am very adventurous by nature. In most of the cases, I used to explore new\
  \ places which are neither familiar with international tourists nor by locals. Actually,\
  \ those places are quite far away from the city with limited access to public transport.\
  \ I agree that those places are beautiful but unfortunately hidden to tourist. One\
  \ day I and my friend went to Portmeirion(https://portmeirion.wales/) through public\
  \ bus. We enjoyed the place a lot but didn't notice the bus schedule to return back\
  \ to our place. Since the place is a combination of both arts and nature so we spent\
  \ the day till it closed. It was a windy evening while we finish our tour and get\
  \ back to the bus station. Upon arrival there we found that there is no bus service\
  \ on that day. We are unable to manage some taxi due to poor network and weather.\
  \ Even we didn't find any accommodation to sit since everything closes at 5 pm.\
  \ Before it gets darker we started to walk towards the city by asking the direction\
  \ (Unfortunately direction boards are very far away). We hardly found any passer-by\
  \ while reaching to the town. The place looks scary as we walked next to the aisle\
  \ of the highway. Anytime an accident can happen since my friend has a dark phobia.\
  \ All the time I was holding his hand tightly and keep speaking to remove the fear\
  \ away. I remember We walked more than 1 h 13 min which is approximately 3.8 miles.\
  \ Finally, we reached a place named Porthmadog. That place looks like a small town\
  \ and we sat in a cafe to have cups of coffee. Again,   After 35 mins of walking,\
  \ we found a bus towards our destination.  I must say it was a best adventurous\
  \ tour in my whole life. It was quite risky since my friend was not comfortable\
  \ in that environment which I discovered while we missed the bus from Portmeirion.\
  \  This adventurous lost and find journey encourages us to visit lots of hidden\
  \ places during midnight as well. \nSince I want to see myself a professional travel\
  \ blogger so I am ready to take the tour anywhere of this beautiful world."
