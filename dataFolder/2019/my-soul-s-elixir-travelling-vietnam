Text: "When you work from 9am to 10pm and still your company expects more, it\u2019\
  s time for a quick escape to calm your nerves.\nThat\u2019s what I did!\nI backpacked\
  \ Vietnam, starting from Ho Chi Minh City, up to Hanoi. And boy it was beautiful!\n\
  \nHo Chi Minh city \nWe landed around 10am, and first got a SIM card for 10$. We\
  \ took a Grab cab to our hostel (hangout hostel). Relaxed a bit and went out to\
  \ explore the busy streets of Saigon. A little walk away was the Saigon Central\
  \ Post Office, which is renowned for being the biggest office in Vietnam. You can\
  \ send a post card, for a price of 15,000VND. Right next to it was the Notre Dame\
  \ Cathedral, built during the French colonization of Vietnam. \nThe Next day we\
  \ took a half-day tour to Cu Chi Tunnels. The entry fee was 110,000VND with guide,\
  \ plus 70,000VND for the commute. We went underground to explore the tunnel system,\
  \ walked around the forest and watched a war documentary explaining the history\
  \ of Vietnam. Gun enthusiast  can visit the gun range and fire rounds of bullets\
  \ for 500,000VND. \n\nHoi An\nFrom there we flew to Da Nang. Took a cab to Hoi An,\
  \ costing 200,000VND. As soon as we reached our hostel (ho binh), we rented a bike\
  \ for 100,000VND and explored the beautiful Ancient Town. The whole town was lit\
  \ up by lanterns at night.\nThe next day we visited the landmark 18th-century Japanese\
  \ bridge along with the spectacular Lantern Market. We bought a couple of lanterns,\
  \ ranging from 50,000VND to 100,000VND. This town is famous for it's quintessential\
  \ cafes... and yes, the egg coffee is a must try. At night we took a boat ride on\
  \ the Hoai river for 50,000VND  and floated paper lanterns on the river for 10,000VND.\n\
  \nDa Nang\nThe day after, we left to Da Nang and took a cab to our next hostel (roll\
  \ Hostel) costed us 150,000VND. 15 min away from Da Nang is Marble mountain. It\
  \ is made up of five towering limestone, each named after five elements - earth,\
  \ water, fire, metal and wood. We visited the Thuy Son Cave and Am Phu Cave, costing\
  \ us 60,000VND. Fortunately, that night there was a live concert hosted by Tiger\
  \ beer beside the famous dragon bridge overlooking the River H\xE0. The concert\
  \ ended with the dragon bridge dazzled us with display of lights, fire, and water.\
  \ \nThe following day, we booked Grab bike ride for 110,000VND 45-minute away to\
  \ Bana Hills. The entry ticket costed us 700,000VND which included the cable car\
  \ to the top of the mountain. This place is JUST GORGEOUS. Located in the middle,\
  \ is the newly built Golden Bridge with hands holding up the platform. What makes\
  \ the bridge more special is the view. Just Breath-taking!\nThe French Village was\
  \ a beautifully realistic with the church, shops and eateries. The underground floor\
  \ arcade games at the Fantasy Park, with more than 105 games is definitely a must.\
  \ We spent the whole day exploring it.\n\nCat Ba\nWe took a flight to Cat bi, and\
  \ picked up an airport cab (since Grab dint work) to Hai Phong port. We chose Lan\
  \ Ha Bay over Halong Bay, and it was spellbinding. The ferry we booked to cat Ba\
  \ island for 200,000VND, took 2 hours to reach Catba Island Hotel (150,000VND).\
  \ \nThe next day we hiked up to the Cannon Fort for the scenic views of a bay with\
  \ tiny houses and rocking fishing boats. We also went to the cat co beaches, which\
  \ are the best on the island.\n\nHanoi\nB\u1EBFn T\xE0u Kh\xE1ch Du L\u1ECBch: This\
  \ is a great place to pick up tickets back to the mainland. Cat Ba to Hanoi costed\
  \ us 170,000VND totally. Hanoi had the best Pho, BBQs and Egg Coffee in the whole\
  \ of Vietnam. We visited the Ho Chi Minh Mausoleum, which is the resting place of\
  \ Revolutionary leader Ho Chi Minh. We then shopped at Ben Th\xE0nh Market to buy\
  \ some Knock-off North Face jacket for around 300,000VND.\n\nAll in all, we travelled\
  \ Vietnam on a budget without much planning. It is, hands down, one of my favourite\
  \ country on the planet."
