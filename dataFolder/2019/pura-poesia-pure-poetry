Text: "Lisboa is probably one of the most charming cities in the world. A city at\
  \ the end of Europe with a lot of Latin culture flow.\nPorto wine, cod fish, fado,\
  \ different art expressions and a bit of nostalgia in the air, are a great combination\
  \ to make this city a capital for lovers.\nIn Lisbon you can either have a great\
  \ dinner at restaurant on the top of the hill and seeing the sunset, or even finish\
  \ at a Fado bar where almost everyone knows each other and you can enjoy good wine\
  \ and pasional music.\nYou can also see a lot of art expression at the white city\
  \ (commonly well known), from the different art and craft galleries, to the different\
  \ music bands and artists playing everywhere. Even street art decorates the city\
  \ in harmony, giving it a poetic touch as you will see: \u2018pura poesia\u2019\
  .\nAnother thing that will make you fall in love with this city, it\u2019s architecture\
  \ that takes advantage of the sinuous territory in which is based the city. With\
  \ a lot of alleys and small parks and plazas, and the different levels of altitude\
  \ of the constructions thanks to all the hills.\nAdditionally, Portuguese people\
  \ are very kind and friendly, full of passion. You won\u2019t find more authentic\
  \ people than Portuguese, who hold their clothes up to dry from one house to another\
  \ and even ladies having conversation from their houses\u2019 windows. Don\u2019\
  t get surprised if you are having a romantic dinner at a restaurant in a plaza and\
  \ then you get hit by a soccer ball from a group of people playing next to you.\
  \ \nPortugal is definitely a city where to relax, be yourself, fall in love and\
  \ being in a bohemian mood."
