Text: "Quito, city of traditions and a lot of history kept for centuries into its\
  \ walls. It was declared as World Heritage Site by UNESCO in 1978. Quito is the\
  \ capital city of Ecuador, South America.  I arrived it by chance when I must stay\
  \ two days due to a trip scale to another country. Full of churches that keep centuries\
  \ of Spanish architecture, sculpture and art. These ones are fullfil of a visual\
  \ pleasure of colors and gold. Angels and saints made by ethnic artisans centuries\
  \ ago are the guardians of the son of God who always stays in the gold plated altar\
  \ while people pray looking for miracles or forgiven, or just sitting there to admire\
  \ all the beauty created by men to deify God.  Also, all these churches are storytellers\
  \ of legends. It\u2019s very known a history that says   San Francisco\u2019s Church\
  \ was built by devil thanks to a pact with a native builder but he could not obtain\
  \ the soul of the human who did the pact because he occulted one stone of the church\
  \ and it is assumed that whoever puts this stone will be followed by the devil in\
  \ order to obtain his soul and finish the deal. . Another really cool experiences\
  \ that I cannot forget about churches was to visit the Basilica of the National\
  \ Vote. A church located in the north of the city. It has the peculiarity that it\
  \ is possible to climb to its highest parts and this constitutes a real adventure.\
  \ Narrow wooden bridges, steep metal steps while the wind blows strongly around\
  \ you. All this is necessary to enjoy one of the best views of the city.\n\nTo walk\
  \ around Quito\u2019s streets is to walk through a history of Incas and Spanish\
  \ conquest. Narrow stone streets occupy its historic center. According to historians\
  \ these stones belonged to Inca constructions, but the Spaniards reused them for\
  \ their own constructions. With a pleasant climate, it becomes very easy to walk\
  \ and be able to contemplate the daily life of Quito. Through its streets it\u2019\
  s possible to enjoy its culinary pleasures full of typical food, from sweets, ice\
  \ creams to dishes that fill the palate with the most varied flavors forming a unique\
  \ experience. About icecream there are traditional ones called \u201Chelados de\
  \ paila\u201D (pan\u2019s icecream). They are ice creams made in a bronze pan which\
  \ is rotated throughout the process on blocks of ice so that the juice that has\
  \ been placed inside it gradually freezes and acquires the characteristic of an\
  \ ice cream. They are a true delight for the palate. One of the famous places is\
  \ called \u201CHeladeria Caribe\u201D with decades of traditions. Don\u2019t forget\
  \ to eat other desserts like quimbolitos or the traditional bread.\n\nIt is also\
  \ possible to visit the Government palace and admire the site where the president\
  \ makes the main decisions to lead the country. In the yellow room you can see paintings\
  \ of all the presidents that Ecuador has had, in addition to being able to walk\
  \ around the palace that has centuries of existence.\nQuito is an impressive city\
  \ to meet and I hope in a next opportunity to have a few more days to fully explore\
  \ all its ancient corners."
