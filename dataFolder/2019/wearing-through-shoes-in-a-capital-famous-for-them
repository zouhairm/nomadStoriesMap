Text: "Paris is many peoples dream. Like a glittering diamond it shines out many facets\
  \ of sparkle. glints of which catch the collective imagination in distinctly different\
  \ ways. For me my obsession with France was a progressive accumulation. the language,\
  \ the literature, French new wave films... I'm not overly effusive when it comes\
  \ to reactions but when I learnt we were going I couldn't not sing out  and dance\
  \ around the house. People got to Paris for food or fashion or wine or art, Perhaps\
  \ they tour and taste and look, I just wanted to walk every street letting the atmosphere\
  \ soak into my heart. \n\nI stayed with my Parents in Paris for 2 gorgeous weeks.\
  \ It was gloriously summer and our apartment in the Bastille District had a pale\
  \ blue door and spiral stair, what more could I possible desire. In the night I\
  \ slept in the room nearest the street listening to the night life buzz. strains\
  \ of laughter would drift in with a puff of breeze and every moment to me was on\
  \ fire with deliciousness to the point of blissful exhaustion. My Parents had feet\
  \ that ached and metabolisms that needed a fan but I just wanted to meander all\
  \ day so I would often set out on foot and they would meet me some time later. I\
  \ did not envy their speed and bus zoomed view over my pattering twisting immersion.\n\
  \nI decided to chart my route by where I could find a good cup of coffee. Being\
  \ from Melbourne my idea of coffee was something far distinct from the cultural\
  \ offering. We fumbled many times through the language for some word that would\
  \ bring forward a creamy cappuccino and not whisked up bubble into bitter water.\
  \ By aid of some tourist magazines I found my coffee shop search was the perfect\
  \ guide through less tourist soaked streets and laneways of Paris. \n\nThe few times\
  \ my Poor Parents decided to follow me I heard distant calls of are we there yet\
  \ echoing far in my wake but despite their frustration they did admit I found them\
  \ some pretty delicious experiences. Curious to me was often when I found a good\
  \ cafe I found an Australian Barista, whether up a Montmartre hill or in the Palais\
  \ royal My own accent was like a magnet resounding through poetic noise.  One day\
  \ I even managed to pair my coffee with Vegemite toast. I had bought a suitcase\
  \ full of Vegemite tubes thinking I'd be bereft and unable to make the most of the\
  \ best bread in the world by smothering it in my favourite spread. Frustratingly\
  \ few perfect coffee joints stocked the authentic croissants and pastry's people\
  \ travel to Paris for. \n\nWe returned  the following summer, getting off the night\
  \ bus felt like coming home. Having traced and retraced my steps over much  map\
  \ I darted instinctively in our accommodations direction. These second two weeks\
  \ my feet ranged further and my connection to Paris forged deeper. My strategy was\
  \ to head out with a map in my pocket that I didn't bother to glance at until I\
  \ felt hopelessly lost. Finally I could taste a real strawberry and cucumber again.\
  \ Load up the fridge with the most yummy non fat yoghurt and be handed a warm baguette\
  \ from a boulang\xE9rie at the brink of shivering through a sudden drenching summer\
  \ shower. \n\nWhenever you were over tired from people a park, church garden or\
  \ courtyard full of deck chairs and books would appear. Was I up in a land atop\
  \ Enid Blyton's 'Faraway Tree'? \n\nThe final day we hit upon a treat we all agreed\
  \ it was safest to discover when it was impossible to visit again. This tiny window\
  \ selling freshly baked authentic Portuguese tarts rests in memory as almost surreal\
  \ in its perfection. Paris is a patchwork of perfect moments you go home and scour\
  \ the streets of your hometown trying to recapture. Fortunately I live in Melbourne.\
  \ You can sleepwalk to a Collingwood que for a Lune Croissant or stalk a hot Agath\xE9\
  \ pastry at the Sth Melbourne Market. Reading Sartre as you eavesdrop on a French\
  \ conversation is almost there but still not quite close enough."
