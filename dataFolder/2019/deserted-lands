Text: "I was just getting off from the train, when I saw the bus departing from the\
  \ station and I realized I would have been late. I was disappointed of myself. The\
  \ problem was not the delay itself, but that someone was waiting for me. Not someone,\
  \ actually. Her.\n\nSo, I ran towards the billboard where the bus time schedule\
  \ was hung up. I would have had to wait for an hour, still.\n\nThen the decision\
  \ was to myself. I could wait and stay there, with the pounding thought that she\
  \ was waiting for me, or I could just walk and try to arrive to the craved destination\
  \ before the much praised bus.\nOf course, as the intelligent man I thought I were,\
  \ I decided to walk. At least not to think too much about the disappointed look\
  \ that was waiting for me.\n\nAs I walked, I noticed the landscape around me. It\
  \ was desolated. Gold-colored fields flanked the filled-with-holes road, but besides\
  \ a crubling small building, which should have been an old shack used to store tools,\
  \ nothing was there.\n\nWhere was she living, now? I remember when she decided to\
  \ leave us, without any good explanation, in the dramatic sunset light filling our\
  \ polished living room. She said she was tired of the life she was living and that\
  \ she wanted to do something valuable with the time she was left with. It was nine\
  \ years ago. Time has passed so slow, yet irretrievably.\n\nI was not sure of where\
  \ I was going. The only information I had was that I should have taken such 405\
  \ bus, that would have led me to a forgotten corner of the World, in a small town\
  \ called - how was it called, again? - with a strange and short name. \nOne more\
  \ time, counting on the faith I had in my belated intelligence, I started thinking\
  \ of the possibilities I had. I decided that the best thing I could do was to follow,\
  \ straight ahead, the already departed bus.\n\nThat was the moment when I started\
  \ noticing the tiny moving figures scattered on the fields' surface. They were men,\
  \ men working the land. Their movements were vigorous and tenacious, as if that\
  \ was the only way they could save themeselves from some kind of evil beast living\
  \ inside their chests.\n\nOn my left, at more or less ten feet away from me, a scrawny\
  \ little boy, that could have been ten years old, was working with the same diligence\
  \ than his aged companions. I saw that he was looking at me, in an astonished way,\
  \ as if it was the first time that he saw someone that he didn't already know. Curious\
  \ as I was, I decided to talk to him, even if only to know what was the purpose\
  \ of all that effort.\n\n- Why are you working so hard, kid? Don't you have better\
  \ things to do? Like, playing with your friend, for example? You're so young!\n\
  - No, Sir. I need to help my father and my grand-father because my little sister\
  \ has to go to school, one day. And she will be a great scientist, you know. We\
  \ all know it. So, I have to work to gain the money that my mother will use to feed\
  \ her, with the proper food, that will make her intelligent. Because you know, to\
  \ get the brain grow in the right way, you need, not only to eat rice, but also\
  \ meat and vegetables. And they cost a lot!\n\nI was astonished. I didn't know what\
  \ to answer. So I smiled and continued walking.\n\nThat was the moment in which\
  \ I realized why my mother left us. She decided to help people in need, because\
  \ we already had everything we needed, we were already grown-ups and full of possibilities,\
  \ while there were many other kids that needed support. My feelings of rage and\
  \ abandonment towards her, nourished for nine long years, ceased, and I developed\
  \ a deep sentiment of admiration and gratitude.\n\nBut still, I was in delay. -\
  \ Hurry up man, your mom is waiting for you! -\nAnd I started running, as fast as\
  \ I could, always straight ahead, with the lungs full of joy."
