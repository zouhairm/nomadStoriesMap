Text: "I\u2019ve made it just in time. In a week or so Japan's remote Shirakawa-go\
  \ region will be near impassable in heavy snowfall. But today Autumn foliage blankets\
  \ the mountains surrounding the Alpine village in a patchwork of amber, crimson\
  \ and bronze. \n\nAs I cross the precarious bridge to reach one of the country\u2019\
  s lesser-known UNESCO World Heritage sites, I\u2019m greeted by dozens of imposing\
  \ thatched farmhouses drenched in unusually mild November sunlight. Some reach nearly\
  \ 50 ft in height. Known as 'Gassho-zukuri', each imposing triangular sloping roof\
  \ keeps off heavy snow. The name translates as \u2018to join hands in prayer\u2019\
  , and their sublime appearance is of palms clasped to the gods.\n\nOn a pilgrimage\
  \ of my own, my travels take me away from the shinkansen tourist routes to the heart\
  \ of rural Gifu prefecture, the setting of Japan\u2019s biggest box office hit of\
  \ the last decade, 'Your Name' ('Kimi No Na Wa' in Japanese). Spellbound by the\
  \ cult coming-of-age animation, which touches on themes of time, tragedy and nature\
  \ (and a dash of gender-swap comedy) I journey to a region once famous mainly for\
  \ its succulent Hida beef. Now it\u2019s on the map for a new generation of anime\
  \ fans.\n\nSmoke fills my nose inside the cavernous gassho farmhouses \u2014 there\
  \ are no chimneys \u2014 and I learn that Ogimachi village is home to only 600 inhabitants\
  \ and a handful of children. Sipping wild grass tea on a tatami mat, there is a\
  \ bittersweet undertone. Who will continue the proud farming legacy in the shadow\
  \ of depopulation and growing international tourism driven by the 2020 Olympics?\n\
  \nMitsuha, the teenage lead in 'Your Name' flashes into my mind; her wish to leave\
  \ Gifu for the bright lights of Tokyo triggers a magical chain of events in the\
  \ film. And I think of the local Hida region\u2019s cute red mascot Sarubobo (monkey\
  \ baby), a crimson creature made as souvenirs by elderly ladies, once toys to keep\
  \ girls indoors away from the dangers of winter. Yet there are now few young children\
  \ left to worry about.\n\nHeading across the village, I stumble upon the quaint\
  \ Doburoku Festival museum located within a shinto shrine, celebrating local folk\
  \ rituals dating back over a thousand years. The elderly lady on the ticket desk\
  \ pulls out a large container of sake on my arrival, to my surprise. \n\n'Please,\
  \ try some of our famous Doburoku sake, made here only in October during our festival'.\
  \ \n\nShe beckons me closer and pours the milky, thick liquid, into a white cup.\
  \ Unlike any sake I\u2019ve ever tasted, it\u2019s creamy, rich and sweet. Praising\
  \ this special drink, I\u2019m delighted to find her eagerly pouring me another.\
  \ During the annual festivities, this sake becomes a sacred offering.\n\n'These\
  \ are the best Autumn colours we\u2019ve ever had in this village', the white-haired\
  \ lady muses while I finish my cup.\n\nCheeks warming as the potent brew goes straight\
  \ to my head, I look out on the tapestry of maples, ginkgos and pines, recalling\
  \ the spiritual concept of 'musubi' that entwines itself through the film 'Your\
  \ Name': threads of time which connect memories and moments. One day I will come\
  \ back to this secluded valley when the winter snows reach the gassho rooftops.\
  \ I make a wish for the community to  brew its special sake for many more generations\
  \ to come."
