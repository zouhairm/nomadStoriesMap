Text: "The fascination of those that came before us has always intrigued me. Over\
  \ the past few years, I have become engulfed in ancient cultures, their way of life\
  \ and building techniques. Although, they are found all over the world there is\
  \ one structure type that dominates my curiosity, the pyramid. So off I go on my\
  \ research  mode and decide that hubby and I should stop thinking about traveling\
  \ and just do it. Mexico, was the first stop on our archaeological adventure. Covered\
  \ in over 150 million acres of forests, Mexico has lots to offer and so much to\
  \ discover. There are hundreds upon hundreds of pyramid structures with most still\
  \ covered in forestation. \n\nSince the country was unknown to us, we decided to\
  \ book guided tours with the same company through the course of several days. We\
  \ visited Tulum, Ek Balam and Chichen Itza. The splendor of the craftsmanship is\
  \ mesmerizing. To think that a primitive culture was able to construct such monolithic\
  \ structures which are still standing today leads me want to know more.     \n\n\
  Where did the Mayan people learn about architecture? Who taught them astronomy?\
  \ How did they know to align their pyramids with the stars?\n\nI remember arriving\
  \ at Chichen Itza and becoming engulfed in the energy. The energy of a culture that\
  \ is alive to this day along with the Mayan language. We were lucky enough to learn\
  \ that one of our tour guides was also an archaeologist. He was so knowledgeable\
  \ and as he escorted us through the grounds stopped to speak with some local vendors.\
  \ The conversation was breathtaking as you can image since they were all speaking\
  \ Mayan.\n\nSpeaking fluent Spanish, I was taken back since I could not understand\
  \ the dialect. Our guide went on to explain that the Mayan way of life is alive\
  \ and thriving. Although, visitors are not allowed to touch the pyramids we were\
  \ able to walk around to other parts of the grounds where we were shown remnants\
  \ of buried pyramids that have yet to be excavated. Our guide informed us that there\
  \ are a vast number of unearthed pyramids which outnumber the structures that can\
  \ be visited.\n\nThe next day, we arrived at Ek Balam. This adventure was different.\
  \ Although, this location is a popular tourist attraction, there weren't as many\
  \ visitors as Chichen Itza. Here we walked around freely and were ale to discover\
  \ and most importantly touch. The energy here was calm and inviting. I tried to\
  \ be adventurous and climb the main pyramid but the steps were too steep for me\
  \ and I was only able to climb up maybe 1/4 of the way. Hubby kept climbing and\
  \ took many photos after he made it to the top. \n\nGiven that I was left to explore\
  \ on my own I made my way through the temple like structure. Here, I was able to\
  \ sit and reflect. Looking at the carvings and truly appreciating what took place\
  \ here many years ago. Placing my hands on stones that had been carried and hand\
  \ carved by an ancient and primitive culture. Wondering who cut the stone that provided\
  \ a place of rest for my body? \n\nStones cut with precision and aligned with the\
  \ stars. This was no primitive culture, this was one of the most advanced cultures\
  \ of the ancient world. Because of the rapidly growing jungle it's no wonder that\
  \ these ancient structures went undiscovered for so long.  They sat protected by\
  \ mother nature and from mankind. \n\nHow did they know to build these monoliths?\
  \ How did they know that the structures would last through time? Who or what gave\
  \ them the knowledge?\n\nThese are some of the questions that have yet to be answered.\
  \ \n\nDeep in the jungles of Mexico you will find some of the most beautiful towering\
  \ structures that will still be standing way beyond our human existence on this\
  \ planet. Adventure awaits as millions of visitors explore this land every year\
  \ in search of answers. You will leave a little more cultured, a little more educated\
  \ and a little closer to our ancient past.   There will always be a new pyramid\
  \ to discover with secrets to be unearthed."
