Text: "Dust. It was everywhere. Running my fingers through my hair, shaking out my\
  \ sock, in my throat - I could feel it. Volunteering at a women\u2019s learning\
  \ center brought me to Kathmandu. It was in Nepal that I would spend the final days\
  \ of my 20s and ring in a new decade on a solo trek in the Annapurna Region.\n\n\
  A knock on my door meant that my homestay\u2019s father had tea ready, some concoction\
  \ of ginger, honey, cinnamon warmth that was the perfect start to cold mornings.\
  \ After a dal bhat brunch and my face mask on, I\u2019d make a twenty minute walk\
  \ to the placement. \n\nThe school was small but the dedication and drive were palpable.\
  \ There was Hira who was given a room to make shawls. She spent fifteen years learning\
  \ the craft and would progress about two meters a day. Seeing these creations first\
  \ hand made me rethink my own consumption habits. There was Gita who was 65 years\
  \ old, the oldest in the group, who gave me a hug after learning how to type her\
  \ name with a capital letter and to turn a computer on and off. Many others\u2019\
  \ names I didn\u2019t catch as they only spoke Nepali, and the most understanding\
  \ we\u2019d share would be the speed of how I tapped my finger on the table was\
  \ the speed of how quickly they needed to click on a mouse to achieve opening a\
  \ folder. \n\nThen there was Susmita, the computer teacher who was a volunteer on\
  \ break from university, one of the only few who spoke English at the school. A\
  \ welcome staff member as many times subjects are taught by whoever was available\
  \ to teach them. As visas are difficult to obtain, Susmita has traveled all over\
  \ Nepal with hopes to someday cross beyond its borders. \n\nThese women were gems\
  \ amongst the rubble, rising up to direct their lives regardless of age, circumstance\
  \ or resources. The days were simple, and sometimes slow, requiring more patience\
  \ than the fast lane world I was used to, that the time to trek from Pokhara came\
  \ by faster than imagined. \n\nHave you ever driven down a pot holed road to get\
  \ to a trailhead? Usually those only last around ten minutes. That\u2019s what the\
  \ eight hour bus ride to Pokhara was like for the majority of the time. Jumping\
  \ out of my seat was a common occurrence. \n\nThe dust lifted in Pokhara and tourist\
  \ amenities abound. A fellow volunteer ended up joining me on the trek and we were\
  \ paired with Pradip, a guide for the past 20 or so years who spent most of his\
  \ time in the office nowadays. And I considered myself lucky, especially after what\
  \ was supposed to be our easiest day turned out to be the most treacherous. \n\n\
  Following the sunrise hike to Poon Hill for a stunning 180 degree view of the Himalayas,\
  \ the day\u2019s trek was scheduled to be relatively moderate in comparison to the\
  \ previous days. That is without snow. Much of what used to be fresh snow turned\
  \ into icy paths winding up and down the mountain. With no cramps or extra socks\
  \ to add friction, losing grip and sliding down with my backpack became the norm.\
  \ It felt almost faster that way until the mountain started curving, presented a\
  \ river down the cliff, and gaining air after sliding over a rock proved less navigable.\
  \ Thanks to Pradip and a man from Barcelona, the sliding stopped and we finally\
  \ made it to our next guesthouse. \n\nThe following day I turned 30 with the sun\
  \ rising on my warm bowl of porridge, ice giving way to snow, and a hug from my\
  \ new friend from volunteering. We found peace amongst the chaos getting most of\
  \ the trail to ourselves and finding a jasmine shrub to carry one of my favorite\
  \ scents through the day. With a route rejig for a hot springs dip, surprise Snickers\
  \ dessert pastry, and minimal WiFi, my heart was full and overwhelming with gratitude.\
  \ Gratitude for life, for friendship and camaraderie in strangers, and for beauty\
  \ and ease in simplicity. \n\nIt wasn\u2019t your typical dirty thirty. It was so\
  \ much more."
