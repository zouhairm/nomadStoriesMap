Text: "15 kilometres ahead, a menacing storm was swelling. In minutes it would swallow\
  \ a few thousand helpless and shivering onlookers. Five waves of blurry brown swiftly\
  \ morphed into one colossal chestnut tsunami, vapour rising from its surf like a\
  \ mirage. This biblical swarm of locusts was ready to strip the land of everything\
  \ living, but we were already surrounded by miles of sandy nothingness. And we wouldn\u2019\
  t be screaming when it hit. \n\nInstead we were cheering the speediest of the 1,108\
  \ Bactrian camels that thundered through Mongolia\u2019s sparse Gobi desert, in\
  \ the largest camel race of all time. And we weren\u2019t shivering with fear. We\
  \ were just excruciatingly cold.\n\n5,000 people were gathered in Mongolia\u2019\
  s busiest square kilometre outside of Ulaanbataar at the unprecedented \xD6mn\xF6\
  govi Camel Festival in the South Gobi. It was rare to find anyone in the world\u2019\
  s least densely populated country, especially in bitter -25\xB0C temperatures. But\
  \ at this event\u2014organised to promote the growth of Bactrian camels\u2014the\
  \ desert was buzzing with life. Many nomadic herdsmen had trekked their prized camels\
  \ miles across the world\u2019s coldest desert to attend. Some had ventured for\
  \ weeks from yurt villages in the distant Altai Mountains and China\u2019s Inner\
  \ Mongolia. \n\nMy desire to see a two-humped Bactrian camel was the main reason\
  \ I journeyed to Mongolia. I wasn\u2019t going to let a vodka-induced hangover initiated\
  \ by Gurdrig, an equally hungover nomad I\u2019d stayed with the night before, stop\
  \ me from witnessing a festival devoted to them. Nor would I accept his repeated\
  \ offers of his granddaughter\u2019s hand in marriage. Regretfully, the multiple\
  \ camel dowry was too much for my puny budget. But really, if I was to ever buy\
  \ a $750 camel, I\u2019d be the one keeping it.\n\nThe Olympic-style opening ceremony\
  \ was my first taste of the adoration nomadic Mongols feel for their camels, and\
  \ a sweeter one than the camel milk tea I\u2019d attempt to digest later. 2,000\
  \ camels and their flag-wielding herdsmen circled the arena as swathes of vibrantly\
  \ dressed nomads excitedly cheered.\n\nBut with a herdsman\u2019s love, comes a\
  \ shade of cruelty. The tradition of nose-pegging is deemed unethical in the Western\
  \ world. For nomads it is the norm; the camel equivalent of the naughty step. To\
  \ the effervescent crowd, a festival without a nose-pegging competition would have\
  \ been incomplete.\n\nAdolescent camels jerk and leap like gazelles to avoid their\
  \ lasso-wielding herders. When caught, a sharp wooden peg pierces their nostril\
  \ before elder nomads attach and braid halters using camel hair. The quickest to\
  \ domesticate their camels become the proud winners.\n\nHowever this victory isn\u2019\
  t just about pride, but the hefty monetary prize that follows. In communities reliant\
  \ on livestock even the smallest prize can help them cling to their traditional\
  \ way of life. If ravaged with extreme weather\u2014like 2010\u2019s dzuds that\
  \ killed 9.7 million livestock\u2014many nomads have no livelihood and must resort\
  \ to poverty in the city.\n\nCamel beauty pageant contestants compete for the same\
  \ prize. Two-humped couples are tarted up like toddler\u2019s dolls, with accessories\
  \ like reindeer antlers, turquoise bows and rainbow scarves. Their matching owners\
  \ parade them over the dusty catwalk dressed in their own ornate outfits. \n\nIf\
  \ the crowd\u2019s traditional clothing is regal, then the couples leading the camels\
  \ look like their emperors and empresses. They have summoned the opulence of their\
  \ famous ancestor\u2014Chinggis Khan\u2014but without his barbarism. Gowns of sapphire\
  \ and magenta stand out in the barren desert; bulky fur robes shield them from it,\
  \ and shimmery pagoda-shaped hats, or toortsogs, complement it. \n\nBy the next\
  \ brisk morning, the storm and tsunami had subsided, and great columns of dusty\
  \ clouds had emerged. Within 35 minutes and 12 seconds, one gleeful rider and camel\
  \ had galloped 15km to cross the line. The desert derby was over!\n\nThis rider\
  \ would receive one of many prizes won that weekend. Joining him was a nose-pierced\
  \ teenager, Mr and Mrs Gobi, and a mother who bore a golden baby; a promising omen\
  \ for future camel populations. But the true victor was nomadic tradition, reinforced\
  \ with a world record and 1,108 more reasons to prevail. \n\nAnd, I finally saw\
  \ a camel\u2026"
