Text: "We were only passing through Mongolia en route to Beijing on our Trans-Siberian\
  \ adventure. But after five days on a train going through Siberia, and an invitation\
  \ from a Mongolian-Russian diplomat we met on the train, two Spanish guys, a Danish\
  \ couple and my friend and I get off the train in Ulan Bator. Leaving the train\
  \ is like walking into a minus 20  degrees Celcius deep freezer, and I wonder how\
  \ I will get through the next few days as we\u2019re not dressed for the occasion.\
  \ The leftovers of communism are evident on our first impression of the city; grey\
  \ cement buildings everywhere, with temples, sprinkled in between here and there.\
  \ The backdrop is snow clad mountains rising into the grey clouds.\n\nWe have to\
  \ borrow some clothes from our diplomat-host to add to the clothes we\u2019ve brought\
  \ for this holiday. We didn\u2019t think we\u2019d get off the train before way\
  \ down further south. I am wearing two pairs of trousers, two t-shirts, one long\
  \ sleeved t-shirt and a jacket, a borrowed scarf, borrowed boots, a borrowed woollen\
  \ hat and borrowed gloves. We have our first lunch in Mongolia. But first, we drink\
  \ Genghis khan vodka. I don\u2019t usually drink hard spirits, but this is more\
  \ of an order from our host than an offer. We have soup with fatty meatballs, fat\
  \ and spirits - protection against the cold.\n\nOur host wants to take us hunting\
  \ the next day. I am excited about shooting a gun, but not so much about shooting\
  \ an animal, so it\u2019s with some worry when we the next day are driven an hour\
  \ out of town. We walk up a hill and from the top we see a sight I thought I\u2019\
  d never see - a group of dinosaurs milling about in the fields beneath us. For a\
  \ brief moment - I blame the vodka that we\u2019ve been force-fed again this morning\
  \ - I believe they\u2019re real. Then I realise that the dinosaurs are statues.\
  \ We\u2019re a few million years too late for the real thing.\n\nTo my relief, our\
  \ hunt turns out to consist of shooting at cans and bottles placed on some rocks.\
  \ After our shooting session, our host hands us some tin cups. He pours vodka into\
  \ each of them from a bottle of Genghis. I impolitely decline, but our host doesn\u2019\
  t know the word \u2018no', and he pours me more vodka, assuring me, \u2018You need\
  \ it in the cold\u2019. So, Bottoms up! The sour hit of liquid hits the back of\
  \ my throat. As it reaches my stomach, I have to focus hard to prevent myself from\
  \ vomiting it all up again. Our host takes a large tin bowl from his bag. He pours\
  \ another bottle of vodka into the bowl, passes it to one of the Spanish guys and\
  \ motions for him to take a sip. He drinks and passes it on. When it\u2019s my turn,\
  \ I try to ignore the strong taste and smell. We make it back to town for a late\
  \ lunch - more soup with fatty balls. And there, in the middle of the table, more\
  \ glasses of vodka are lined up, ready for filling and emptying.\n\nOn our last\
  \ night, our host takes us to a nightclub which has more glittering disco-balls\
  \ than I\u2019ve ever seen. I look forward to enjoying a drink other than vodka\
  \ but our host has other ideas, and he brings back a bottle of Genghis from the\
  \ bar. The same pop hit that has plagued Europe this past summer\_comes on the sound\
  \ system. Some might say the world is a small place. I think the world is a big\
  \ place; it\u2019s just that not only people, but things, and indeed songs, can\
  \ travel too. The next day it\u2019s time to get back on track. We wave goodbye\
  \ with hearts full of gratitude, bellies full of fat and heads full of Genghis.\
  \ The train heads towards the plains and the mountains. The next morning we see\
  \ the first glimpses of the Great Wall of China, and I catch myself hoping that\
  \ the wall will keep a safe distance between Genghis and me."
