Text: "All around me people are filled with tears, hugging one another, saying our\
  \ dreaded goodbyes. The adventures and experiences we shared together over the last\
  \ two weeks, bonding us for life. Our group of thirty has slowly dissipated until\
  \ only a few others and I remain, tears still lingering in the back of our eyes\
  \ at the thought of returning to reality. \n\nI sit quietly in the lobby of the\
  \ run-down hotel in Budapest, with an old bartender to my right and three fellow\
  \ travelers to my left. Nothing but the sound of a foreign language and a ringing\
  \ telephone in the background.\n\nI push the thought of home out of my mind, knowing\
  \ within 24 hours I\u2019ll be back in Canada, returning to the grind. I still had\
  \ a few hours until my flight so I decided to check my email. Being too cheap to\
  \ pay the incredible overseas phone fees, all I have is my iPad, the connection\
  \ in this old place constantly switching between on and off. At length, my email\
  \ loads and the message awaiting me consumes me with dread, my entire body turning\
  \ hot as panic overtakes me.\n\nThe unthinkable has just happened. Of all the days\
  \ in the year for this to occur, it had to be today. My plane ride home, was with\
  \ a major, reputable and seasoned airline, which had just gone bankrupt. Nothing\
  \ to show but a lousy email informing me my flight was no longer available. Now\
  \ what?\n\nAlone in a foreign country, with a foreign language, low on money, with\
  \ nowhere to go and no idea what to do, I\u2019m consumed with fear. I scan the\
  \ email for some sort of direction but there is nothing. I can see the other three\
  \ travellers have left. I am truly alone. With no phone and no number to call I\
  \ am lost and confused. I\u2019m dazed by the lack of accommodation, the implausibility\
  \ that this was happening to me today. I sit motionless, eagerly awaiting a reply\
  \ from my parents, but the time difference is not to my advantage. \n\nSomewhere\
  \ in all my panic, a familiar person, not much older than I, makes his way down\
  \ the stairs before me. I am filled with relief. I am not alone after all. As he\
  \ approaches, I frantically explain my situation, as if saying it quicker and unintelligibly\
  \ could somehow fix it sooner. In between the sniffles and dramatics he manages\
  \ to understand my dilemma. With the subtlest of smiles, his eyes meet mine, with\
  \ a look of both kindness and intrigue and I know my adventure isn\u2019t quite\
  \ over yet after all. It seemed reality would have to wait. \n\nTo my great fortune,\
  \ he was heading back the same direction I needed to go. Returning to our starting\
  \ point, Germany, for another tour and happened to have room in the back of his\
  \ motorcycle. I couldn\u2019t believe the odds. It was as if somehow I had entered\
  \ into the third instalment of The Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants. I had found\
  \ a new way home after all.\n\nThough, boundaries of professionalism had kept us\
  \ no more than acquaintances over the past few weeks, I found myself constantly\
  \ soaking in his every word, his unfathomable knowledge like music to my ears. He\
  \ was the tour guide after all, so he knew it well. \n\nWith no other option then\
  \ to ditch my suitcase, I\u2019m left with only my backpack. The warm sun beating\
  \ down on us, wind blowing through my hair and my arms wrapped around his body,\
  \ we make our way through the incredible beauty of the endless green fields of Austria,\
  \ Czech Republic and Germany. Between the mountains, landmarks and city strolls,\
  \ we stop for coffee, strudels and river naps. My own personal tour guide filling\
  \ me with endless knowledge. For the first time I can see through local eyes.  \n\
  \nThe fifteen-hour detour was too quick. As the bike pulls up to the Munich airport,\
  \ a smile sits across my face, as I reflect on the turn of events. The man waving\
  \ goodbye, no longer an acquaintance but a friend for life. The memories of our\
  \ adventure instilled in my brain forever."
