Text: "When I told my partner, I wanted to visit Australia he was less than keen.\
  \ Australia was miles away, he said, and we\u2019d have to take off an inordinate\
  \ amount of annual leave. When he questioned my motive for wanting to visit Oz I\
  \ found myself at a bit of a loss. At the time, I fell into the 18-30 millennial\
  \ crowd and trips to Australia, South America and South East Asia just felt like\
  \ the done thing. Besides, it had the sun, sea, scenery and surf\u2026what more\
  \ could a travel junkie ask for?\n\nHowever, a distinct lack of time off (and funds)\
  \ led us to the beautiful island of Jamaica where my partner had relatives. I wasn\u2019\
  t sure I\u2019d get the adventurous travel experience I\u2019d been hoping for,\
  \ but my other half assured me I would find all that I needed in Jamaica and he\
  \ was right!\n\nI\u2019m an active traveller. I love getting deep into the nature\
  \ and culture of every country I visit so I was thrilled to spend our first day\
  \ exploring the blue mountains, Jamaica\u2019s longest mountain range. Our tour\
  \ guide Sam told us of the hard-working farmers who lived in the foothills cultivating\
  \ the famous Jamaica Blue Mountain coffee all year round exporting it to other Caribbean\
  \ islands and beyond. \n\nAs we drove up the windy roads, I shivered, absorbing\
  \ the palpable drop in temperature. Long gone was the sweltering Jamaican heat,\
  \ all I could feel was the sharp breeze whipping in and out of the peaks. Eventually,\
  \ we reached an area no longer accessible by car and continued the trail by foot\
  \ visiting a coffee farm along the way. \n\nWe met Lionel and his wife who\u2019\
  d been farming coffee for over forty years. I was enthralled as they showed us the\
  \ process the coffee went through from seed to shelf. I\u2019m no connoisseur but\
  \ that Blue Mountain coffee was some of the best I\u2019ve ever tasted. It was a\
  \ humbling experience witnessing the creation process and seeing the hard work that\
  \ goes into our morning caffeine fix. \n\nOur final stop was the mountain peak.\
  \ We\u2019d packed a lunch and were lucky enough to eat and rest atop the colossal\
  \ crest. The view was like no other. Vast azure sky sat atop lush green hills as\
  \ far as the eye could see. It was nothing like the Jamaica I\u2019d seen in travel\
  \ brochures with sandy beaches, jerk chicken and rum punch. This was breath-taking,\
  \ a hidden gem nestled in the Carib isles. \n\nThat trip was a great eye opener\
  \ for me and changed the way I travel immensely. Not only did it teach me the beauty\
  \ of the road less travelled, but it also taught me to be open to every experience\
  \ that presents itself. Now, when I travel, I pay less attention to what\u2019s\
  \ popular, tune into what I want from my trip and take care to follow my own internal\
  \ compass as my personal tour guide."
