Text: "Home is where the heart is- a place of comfort and belonging. Yet our desire\
  \ to explore the world makes us blind to the wonder it can also offer. One such\
  \ thing happened to me when I said goodbye to my home of twenty-one years, Pakistan,\
  \ and ventured off to a new land.\nStarting from the middle - east, since that\u2019\
  s where I worked, all the way from South Asia to Europe. My next venture was to\
  \ be the America\u2019s, when due to some visa issues, I decided to go back to my\
  \ home land instead. \nNine years and eighteen countries later, I went back to my\
  \ country- not as its residence but as a tourist. And man I was disappointed. \n\
  I was disappoited at my lack of appreciation of my own roots. I belonged to this\
  \ magical please and I\u2019d been looking for magic all over the world. \nI started\
  \ with Rawalpindi, my birth place and it\u2019s twin city islamabad. I started by\
  \ exploring the roaring, packed old bazaars of Rawalpindi such as the historical\
  \ Raja Bazar, I found an unexpected gem- Bagh Saradara Mandir, - a ancient Hindu\
  \ temple. A reminder of the dominating hindu and Sikh population, once upon a time.\
  \ I was surprised to know that the temple is functional and fee Hindus families\
  \ still residing in the region frequalty visit it. \nWhile Rawalpindi is a historical\
  \ marvel. Islamabad is a marriage of nature and urbanization. I forgot how well\
  \ organized this city was, not to mention breathtakingly beautiful. My first few\
  \ days were spent catching up with some old friends and socializing with the new\
  \ ones. I was surprised to find all sorts of restaurants and cafes popped up in\
  \ Islamabad from all over the region. A testament to the diverse population in Islamabad.\
  \ \nOne thing however was the same, the fact that every nook and corner of this\
  \ city provided a breath taking view of marghallah hills. Of all the eighteen countries\
  \ I had visited, the raw and wild beauty of Islamabad has no equal. \nAfter eight\
  \ short days in Islamabad, my friends and I decided to take a road trip to the heart\
  \ is Punjabi namely Lahore. \nIt was a great idea. Since the road alone from Rawalpindi\
  \ to Lahore is an adventure in itself. We took the old GT road not the motorway\
  \ which is less populated. By doing so, we got a chance to view the yellow flowered,\
  \ mustard fields- a trademark of the Punjab. \nFew of you know that the way from\
  \ Rawalpindi and Lahore is the home to Khewra mountains, home to the largest salt\
  \ mines in the world. We wanted to stop by to explore the great mines but we didn\u2019\
  t and I regret it till now. Therefore if you\u2019re ever in lahore, you must, I\
  \ repeat, you must visit th Khewra mines. Discovered by The soldiers of Alexander\
  \ the Great according to some legends. The mines are where 90 percent of the pink\
  \ salt that you keep calling Himalayan salt is made. In Pakistan I realized Himalayan\
  \ salt is nothing more than Lahori salt. But lahori salt doesn\u2019t sound as majestic,\
  \ right? \nAnywyay, I\u2019m getting off topic here. So why I couldn\u2019t stop\
  \ at Khewra mines was because we had an a dinner reservation at the \u201CHaveli\u201D\
  \ restaurant at Haveli Khaled khan. Eating at that restaurant would transport to\
  \ a new era. I felt like a royal. The service and and hospitality made me feel like\
  \ a royal. Not to mention the view of the  impeccably perfect Shahi mosque built\
  \ by Emperor Aurangzeb in 1673 A.D. \nAfter dinner we headed to our hotel and on\
  \ the way I was blown away by the amount of beautiful and diverse architecture Lahore\
  \ has to offer. There\u2019s the Lahore forte of course, built by the Mughals. Then\
  \ there\u2019s the famous Lahotr railway station, the post office and the national\
  \ librabty built by the British, plus countless religious buildings like Sikh and\
  \ hindu Temples. \nMy two week adventure in these three cities made me realize that\
  \ sometime you need to get away from home and unfamiliar is yourself with the familiar\
  \ to truly appreciate it."
