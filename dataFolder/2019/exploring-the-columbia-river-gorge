Text: "I\u2019ve drove through this amazing gorge in the past and gazed upon it\u2019\
  s beauty but never really stopped and explored the area, so that\u2019s exactly\
  \ what we did last weekend and it\u2019s one of my favorite locations in both Washington\
  \ and Oregon, as it is located on both sides.\n\nWe made our way to the Columbia\
  \ River Gorge from the Oregon side, which has more of the popular views and waterfalls.\
  \ I recommend taking the Historic Highway, just the drive is gorgeous and you will\
  \ find many waterfalls along the way that I cannot find the names to, as they are\
  \ a little smaller, but it is a must do. If you have an R. V, it may not be quiet\
  \ safe for you to drive it though.\n\nThe first official stop we made was Latourell\
  \ Falls, one of my favorite Oregon waterfalls, you can get right up to where the\
  \ water meets. It\u2019s so powerful you can feel the spray without being too close,\
  \ this thing is massive!\n\n \nThere are many other stops along the Historic Highway,\
  \ Multnomah Falls, the tallest waterfall in Oregon, was unfortunately blocked off\
  \ during the season, so we couldn\u2019t get any good shots, but it is still quiet\
  \ the view. When on the Washington side of the Gorge, you can still see this massive\
  \ waterfall on the other side of the Columbia River.\n\nWe didn\u2019t get photos\
  \ of Bridal Veil Falls or Horsetail Falls because that part of the Historic Highway\
  \ was closed when we were there, but we will be sure to be back to these natural\
  \ wonders.\n\nWhen driving along the Gorge, make sure to look onto the Washington\
  \ side of the river to see an enormous waterfall going down into the river, I\u2019\
  m not sure of the name of this but it is absolutely breathtaking.\n\nAs I said before,\
  \ you will run into waterfalls along this highway every few minutes and each one\
  \ is worth stopping to see, some even without names. For a full list of the popular\
  \ waterfalls in the Columbia River Gorge, click here.\n\nWe crossed over the Bridge\
  \ Of The Gods, which links the Oregon portion of the Gorge to Washington and is\
  \ a two dollar toll bridge that is pretty massive and spectacular.\n\n\nOnce we\
  \ got onto the Washington side, we found a local secret waterfall that took us on\
  \ a National Forest Development road all the way up a mountain where it began to\
  \ snow! By the time we left this area, we had about two feet of snow!\n\nThe waterfall\
  \ we saw was Panther Creek Falls and it was amazing, it was a short hike downhill\
  \ with an overlook, it also has a little rock climb down to the lower level. It\
  \ has a rope to help you down and I definitely recommend it.\n\nAfterwards, we started\
  \ heading towards our Airbnb towards Washougal and stopped at Cape Horn, right off\
  \ the highway and it is STUNNING! You can see the entire Gorge and even spot the\
  \ waterfalls on the Oregon side.\n\n\nWe are going to be heading back to this area\
  \ soon, the summer would be more ideal for this area so we wont run into snow again.\
  \ But after doing some research, we realized that there is an incredible amount\
  \ of hidden waterfalls on the Washington side of the Gorge that we must see! We\
  \ already have a wish list."
