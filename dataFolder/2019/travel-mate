Text: "I didn't expect to find her that day. And suddenly, I found myself totally\
  \ unprepared and insecure. She ran into me several times without asking for permission.\
  \ The first time I saw her was still in Porto, on a beautiful Sunday morning, right\
  \ when I woke up and realized that I was alone. I thought she was going to stay\
  \ with me just in those lonely days, but I was definitely wrong.\n\nShe left me\
  \ again when I met my friends in Lisbon for new year\u2019s eve. She also wasn\u2019\
  t with me on the Christmas holiday. Neither at college tests or in the masses. However,\
  \ in the second that I took that plane for Paris, I knew that she was there, sited\
  \ by my side.\n\nParis was amazing for both of us. We walked, we ate cr\xE8me br\xFB\
  l\xE9e, we were enchanted by Louvre Museum, we took lots and lots of pictures. She\
  \ left me alone just a few moments when I had to meet a friend or make a call.\n\
  \nThen, I went back to the airport and catch my plane to Krakow. There, she was\
  \ with me all the time, even when I met some Brazilians in the hostel, or when I\
  \ talked about me with that Canadian old man. She was holding my hand strongly in\
  \ the Nazi concentration camps of Auschwitz.\n\nOur third stopped was in Berlin,\
  \ Germany. I Was pretty happy she was with me there, because of what a lonely city!\
  \ Berlin was cold, and German people are cooler yet. But even so, our tours were\
  \ wonderful. I was really amazed about the history marks in that city, and about\
  \ how the old city can live perfectly with the new modern buildings. Berlin is fantastic.\n\
  \nFrom Germany, we went to Budapest, Hungary, and I can tell you for sure that we\
  \ had never been so close to each other. We walked for hours, we went alone to a\
  \ thermal pool at night (when it was doing negative degrees). We met two Indian\
  \ girls and talked about their culture. We were actually getting along pretty well.\n\
  \nOur last country to visit was Italy. First in Pisa, to see the tower and take\
  \ a picture holding it. We were comfortable there, like if hostels and planes were\
  \ now our home. Fun fact: I just remembered now listening to a song that says that\
  \ \u201Chome is where your heart is set in stone\u201D. Maybe it is.\n\nWe arrived\
  \ in Rome at night, and the city was astonishing. There, when I met new friends,\
  \ it wasn\u2019t myself I was introducing any more. She was just giving in and presenting\
  \ herself. But I didn't care, she is actually a nice girl.\n\nNow, she was always\
  \ there, inside me, talking in my head, making me feel weird things, and she was\
  \ so, so different from the version I used to know. It is funny how a trip can make\
  \ from yourself a brand-new person."
