Text: "Even if in Western Europe I'm still regarded as a total stranger sometimes\
  \ (especially when I mention my country of origin, Romania), in Southeast Asia I\
  \ encountered no prejudice whatsoever - quite the opposite: people there made me\
  \ feel welcome right away. \n\n\nThe official reason for my voyage was a dear Cambodian\
  \ friend I met years ago in Los Angeles. But why just go to Phnom Penh when I could\
  \ tour several Asian countries? Always in search of new challenges, I thus decided\
  \ to extend my Asian trip to 3 weeks and first go to Bangkok, dying to finally experience\
  \ the famous/infamous metropolis. \n\n\nHowever, to make sure the itinerary would\
  \ be highly original, I\u2019d soon leave Bangkok for Hanoi, eager to meet my friend's\
  \ friend and get to know North Vietnam. \n\nWhat I recall upon my arrival in Hanoi...\
  \ my surprise at\_the kindness and politeness of the people - from the bus driver\
  \ to the hotel staff. \nEven my passport was looked at with utmost curiosity and\
  \ interest - I was no longer a citizen of a former communist country currently plagued\
  \ by corruption (& the Western European stereotypes could continue), I was an European\
  \ obviously interested in the Vietnamese culture and people, hence my 5 nights stay\
  \ in their Old Quarter hotel. (Always refreshing to escape the European stereotypes!)\n\
  \n\nThe bustling Old Quarter on a Friday night delighted me - little did I know\
  \ that the next days would only enhance that feeling of joy\u2026 \n\nMy new Vietnamese\
  \ friend dedicated her entire day to showing me the temples and pagodas of the city,\
  \ the Citadel Museum and national monuments - with Uncle Ho (Chi Min) as the undisputed\
  \ protagonist (the Mausoleum, the exhibitions about the Revolution or the post Vietnam\
  \ war artworks). \n\n\nEastern Europe, just like China, Cuba and Vietnam have a\
  \ common history that hasn't left them untouched\u2026 by no means. I guess it's\
  \ the way each of these states has dealt with and been able to transform (or disguise)\
  \ the traces of socialism that makes all the difference\u2026 maybe that's why there's\
  \ this empathy and mutual understanding between the Balkan countries - we know it\
  \ takes so long for things to change, for mentalities to get updated, for a system\
  \ to finally allow some type of development\u2026 \n\n\nHowever, it\u2019s not my\
  \ background that made me feel closer to the Vietnamese - it was the hospitality\
  \ and the moments we shared, the food and the cordiality: all that thanks to a new\
  \ and unconditionally won friend. \n\n\nI truly believe that's what makes a journey\
  \ cathartic - experiencing firsthand, understanding how people live and find hope\
  \ in the positive aspects of life: the tranquility of the Buddhist temples, the\
  \ natural wonders around Halong Bay and Trang An, where time seemed to have stopped...\
  \ \n\nActually, I chose to lose all sense of European time in Vietnam and quickly\
  \ adapted to the citylife (which also involves skillfully \u201Cmanaging\u201D the\
  \ infernal traffic!). \n\nOne day I just got on a local train and headed to the\
  \ closest town, Ninh Binh. \u201CWhy?\u201D asked the 2 English speakers on the\
  \ train (students that decided to follow me on social media when they heard I was\
  \ a longtime world traveler). My answer (\u201Cout of curiosity!\u201D), was perhaps\
  \ strange, but not that illogical to them: \u201Cyou'll have quite a story for your\
  \ friends\u201D, the girl agreed. \n\n\nThat day I was thrilled to just walk 5 hours\
  \ in that blessed sun, breathe fresh air, avoid the traffic-plagued streets and\
  \ the colorful party banners promising great progress thanks to the new 5-year plan.\
  \ \n\nEndless rice fields everywhere\u2026 the soothing view of the mountains on\
  \ the horizon, a village with people greeting me every step of the way\u2026 tranquility\u2026\
  \ and timelessness. Maybe that's what the Old World lacks and craves for: time.\n\
  Again, the feeling of literally \u201Cexiting\u201D time was overwhelming... \n\n\
  \nReality caught up with me when I laid eyes on other Europeans in the only cafe\
  \ in Ninh Binh\u2026 we all had to catch the Hanoi train, the day was nearing its\
  \ end...\n\nI had 10 more days to go and one more country to discover\u2026 but\
  \ still, I wished time would never start ticking again."
