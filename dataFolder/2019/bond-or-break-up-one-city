Text: "Until I reached there, I had no idea what I ought to find in my tourist destination.\
  \ Little did i know i could land into a city with two historical places; a flower\
  \ park for \u201Crelationship bonding\u201D and a steep hill for \u201Crelationship\
  \ break up\u201D. One day, Allan invited us for a tour to his hometown, Cianjur,\
  \ which is a 3hours drive from Bandung city. Allan is a cheery and good-hearted\
  \ gentleman who can spend all his monthly salary just to make his \u2018foreigner\u2019\
  \ friends happy. As early as 6:00am on a cold Saturday morning, we were picked up\
  \ by a private car to Cianjur from MacDonald Dago in Bandung. Our driver on glancing\
  \ at us, couldn\u2019t believe what he saw; a combination of dark-colored, tall,\
  \ beardy and light-skinned men but, nevertheless, he had to let us in amidst the\
  \ wonder. On our way, the driver\u2019s \u201Cstate of being astonished\u201D couldn\u2019\
  t stop but rather escalated due to the blend of different languages used in the\
  \ car, ranging from English, French, Arabic and Indonesian.  As it is a common practice\
  \ for Indonesians to ask questions to foreigners such as; \u201CWhat is your name?\u201D\
  \ \u201CWhere do you come from?\u201D \u201CWhat do you do in Indonesia?\u201D \u201C\
  What is your best Indonesia dish?\u201D the driver had gathered adequate guts to\
  \ ask each of us the above questions. On arrival at Jayanti hill, we were welcomed\
  \ by \u201Ca swam of traders\u201D selling stuff ranging from craftwork to food.\
  \ No sooner had we arrived than Allan led us to a photo booth with some of his friends\
  \ who wanted to take photos with foreigners. Some preferred to take photos with\
  \ black people, a number of them with light-skinned people while others preferred\
  \ a combination of both colors. Other local tourists also couldn\u2019t wait to\
  \ join the photo booth with us. We then embarked on hiking the mountain through\
  \ a green thick forest until the top. The \u201Ccool\u201D peak of the hill is about\
  \ 2hours on foot from the bottom. On our way up, we could meet all sorts of people\
  \ and groups ranging from individuals, couples, families and students in uniform.\
  \ We met people who were taking rest at different points up the hill but all were\
  \ aiming at reaching the top, which had a beautiful water fall and \u201Cno sun\u201D\
  \ conditions. We too couldn\u2019t defy resting as well. However much Allan had\
  \ motivated us to move up and see the paradise at the top of the hill, some of us\
  \ developed gloomy faces and we wished we could tell him to stop halfway the journey\
  \ and walk down. Majority of the other tourists on the hike showed off sad faces,\
  \ too. All our faces seemed to agree on these issues \u201CI want to go back down\
  \ the hill\u201D \u201CI don\u2019t care even if i don\u2019t reach the top\u201D\
  \ \u201CI wish I knew it was a lengthy and tiring hike, I wouldn\u2019t have joined\u201D\
  . At the moment we had about a quarter of the journey to reach, Allan gathered us\
  \ at a resting point and told us that very few people can reach the top of that\
  \ hill with the happiness and vigor that they should have, to glimpse at the paradise,\
  \ instead majority reach the paradise when they are already tired and fed up of\
  \ climbing the hill. And that\u2019s why the hill is called the relationship break\
  \ up hill. Most of the times if a couple could set off to climb the hill, one of\
  \ the partners, who has never been to that hill, will stop halfway the journey,\
  \ walk down the hill and thus separate from the other partner who continues until\
  \ the top.\nAs opposed to the above, we continued to the flower park which is a\
  \ few minutes\u2019 drive from the first site, but in the same town. The park is\
  \ endowed with a wide variety of beautiful aromatic flowers, clear pathways and\
  \ beautiful scenery for photo. All those features plus the beautiful waterfall near\
  \ the entrance brings a relaxation and soothing mood, conducive for bonding a relationship.\
  \ The narrow paths between the dense thickets of colored flowers provide the closeness\
  \ that ignites a love relationship."
