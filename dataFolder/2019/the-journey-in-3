Text: "What do i know about the unknown? i didn't know but intended to find out. The\
  \ mind couldn't take me where I so desperately wanted to reach, so it had to be\
  \ dropped. Who am I? is not a question within the mind's ability to answer.\n\n\
  I knew very well as I was nearing the end of my 6 years of training as a doctor\
  \ that it wasn't for me. I escaped to Auroville, a township near Pondicherry in\
  \ south India, where my nights were spent stargazing to calm my anxieties. The stars,\
  \ like holes poked in a tarpaulin roof whispered to me of light beyond the black\
  \ clouds I found myself under. There is meaning in this world hiding in plain sight.\
  \ I was longing to open my eyes to it.\n\nThe coastal town of Chennai was only going\
  \ to be a layover for me to head back home to New Delhi, to my previous reality.\
  \ i wasn't ready for this. \nAs i strolled in the airport I came across a sign saying\
  \ emergency exit. To my paralyzed mind this was a siren's call. Somewhere between\
  \ the metro ride out of the airport and the auto rickshaw to nowhere that I took\
  \ next, the question \"Who am I beyond my fears?\" became a raging fire.\n\nThat\
  \ night I had nowhere to go, no concrete plans and no predetermined destination.\
  \ I saw the city as if for the first time, as if so many things had come to life\
  \ that I never knew existed. The smell of salt in the air was sweat and sea. I spent\
  \ a lot of time near the train stations looking at the people that made up the city\
  \ of Chennai, Every person the same, going somewhere meaningful in their different\
  \ contexts\n. \nI boarded the unreserved booth of the train. A coach designed to\
  \ carry around thirty people holding about eighty people squeezed together until\
  \ the entire coach became a network of human dominoes where the movement of one\
  \ in the front would be felt by the last man in the coach. Three women dressed in\
  \ traditional Indian garb started singing, even in lack of physical space there\
  \ was space for song and conversation. \n\nI changed trains thrice, each time to\
  \ look at the world and see that it is happening everywhere, beyond my bubble of\
  \ existence life continues in its play. Some trains were more crowded than others,\
  \ some were cleaner and some had men sitting in the toilet for lack of space, every\
  \ train was telling a story of a people trying their best to exist in world that\
  \ seems so chaotic. After 2 days in trains I was tired and wanted a place to sit.\
  \ A Sikh man with long beard and aggressive demeanor to match resentfully made space\
  \ for me to sit. Very soon we were in conversation about the nature of god and his\
  \ religion. I told him I was looking for god, \"To find god you needn't go anywhere,\
  \ there is nowhere to go\" he said. \n\nI took the next train home."
