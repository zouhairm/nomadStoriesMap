Text: "It was 16 December 2018. I flew from Milan to Gdansk. Landed at 9 in the morning.\
  \ I saw the window, all was white. I expected that it would be shiny since during\
  \ the flight  the sky was so clear blue. When stepped my feet at the airport I was\
  \ feeling so lost. I had no idea on my head what I would do. I experienced winter\
  \ in Japan at -7 degrees but I didnt know that 8 degrees in Poland was colder. Then\
  \ I sat at the airport bench. I asked a taxi driver how much I must pay to go to\
  \ Rzesnicka, he told me that it is 80 zloty. Damn expensive to me as a budget traveler.\
  \ So I decide to take bus. Due to heavy snow, the bus arrived so late. It came at\
  \ 2 pm. \nWhile i was in the bus, I asked a girl where i had to stop. She said two\
  \ more stops. I jumped off the bus. I was like nowhere. As it was not any single\
  \ house. It was only trees and snow everywhere. Then I walked around ten minutes\
  \ and found two small houses with three adults playing snowballs. Yes, it was so\
  \ cold but the view to me is so breathtaking. Small houses with snowy roof and smokey\
  \ chimney! It was like beautiful dream. I imagine that inside those houses the wives\
  \ were making tomato soup like i used to read in a story book. \nThen I approached\
  \ the men, they told me that Rzesnicka is still so far a way. I must take train\
  \ to reach it. Then they showed me where i could find the train station. I got the\
  \ location. What I saw was nothing! Nobody. There were only railways which were\
  \ covered by snow. Then a young boy came on the opposite direction. Thank god he\
  \ speaks English. The matter was only we could not hear one another due to the heavy\
  \ snow. So we must talk like screaming when i asked him the adress. And it is hard\
  \ for me and him to understand each other as the map showed the street of the hotel\
  \ in Polish. It was so funny. Yelling one another at the opposite railways. But\
  \ at the end I could understand the direction he gave. I yelled goodbye when the\
  \ train came. Thats the 1st nice guy I met on the 1st day in Poland. \nOn the train\
  \ i must buy another ticket. And again one guy came and asked me where to go. He\
  \ was on his way to Warsaw..good for me that he took me to the Gdansk Glowny. And\
  \ during my short trip to Glowny station...oh my god, it was so beautiful. Medieval\
  \ buildings with snowy roof. Too beautiful. My second angel guy saw how excited\
  \ i was to see that view. He was just smiled and asked if I had never seen this\
  \ view in my life. Yes, i never. Gdansk is too beautiful. Beyond my expectation\
  \ (as two weeks before i started my trip one friend showed video how he didnt enjoy\
  \ Poland. He might be just not lucky). \nI reached my hotel at 4 PM, took hot shower..then\
  \ enjoyed the view out of the window. I spent 6 days in Gdansk. I saw so many things\
  \ in here. The very breathtaking view of train which I saw from the bridge..snowy..i\
  \ was feeling like i was in the old movie. And I saw the talles chrismast tree i\
  \ have ever seen at night market. It was even higher than H&M shop. Wonderful. And\
  \ on my last day, a friendly Polish man took me to the old town to see more historical\
  \ site. We had coffee and very delicios bread. At 3 PM i took flixbus to Warsaw.\
  \ Gdansk, I'm so in love with you. I wish to be back. Thats what i was and  still\
  \ thinking.\nOn the bus, I found that all those three guys who helped told me that\
  \ their name is Alexander.  Three Alexes in a Beautiful Land. \nGod Bless Poland\
  \ xoxo."
