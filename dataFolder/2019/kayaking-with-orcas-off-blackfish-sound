Text: "We were ten brightly colored kayaks drifting in the channel between a series\
  \ of small islands just off Vancouver's Blackfish Sound. It was nearing dusk and\
  \ the long rays of the sun gave the cedar-clad rocky islands an amber glow above\
  \ the water's deep blue. We all stared into the shadows down the channel and waited\
  \ expectantly.\n\nLess than an hour before, we had been at our campsite, lined up\
  \ for dinner. With our two guides, we were sixteen travelers on vacation, lured\
  \ by the promise of kayaking with orcas, more commonly known as killer whales. Three\
  \ days into the trip, we had not been disappointed. We had seen lots of orcas, though\
  \ mostly at a distance.  That would soon change. \n \nOur lead guide David's handheld\
  \ radio crackled. I couldn't hear the conversation but when he put down the radio,\
  \ he yelled, \"Orcas.  A16s. We'll eat later. Let's go.\" \n\nWe put our plates\
  \ down on the log beside the camp kitchen and ran to the boats, pulling on our PFDs.\
  \  We pushed off from the beach and followed David, who had taken the lead,  paddling\
  \ fast, not the easy pace typical of our days so far. We paddled hard to keep up.\
  \  It was clear that we were in a race to get to the right spot before the pod designated\
  \ A16 passed us by. \n\nEach orca has distinct identifying markings. To the trained\
  \ eye, each could be identified and its history tracked. Rather than give them cute\
  \ anthropomorphic names, however, researchers had labeled each individual by their\
  \ family units, each family led by a matriarch. We were hoping to meet a pod led\
  \ by the eldest female that the naturalists had dubbed A16.\n\n When David stopped\
  \ paddling, we all coasted to a halt and began to drift in the waterway between\
  \ the chain of islands. It wasn't long before, in the shadows far up channel, a\
  \ small cloud appeared just above the surface. An instant later, we heard the distinctive\
  \ puff of an orca blow.  Soon there were more small vapor clouds as more orcas rose\
  \ for air and then dove again, swimming straight toward us. \n\nDavid started quieting\
  \ tapping the coaming of his kayak with his fingertips. Soon we all followed suit.\
  \ The tapping reverberated through the hulls of the kayaks and made it easier for\
  \ the orcas to know where we were.  \n\nIn a few minutes, the orca blows grew more\
  \ frequent as the distance between us and the pod was halved. We could clearly see\
  \ the dorsal fins rising from the water, slicing through the misty cloud of the\
  \ spouts. \n\nAnd then there was nothing. The pod appeared to have vanished. We\
  \ looked around. Had they passed beneath us? Where had they gone? \n\nThen a dorsal\
  \ fin rose from the water directly ahead of the group. Sharp, black, dripping drops\
  \ of water that shone in the long rays of the sun, it kept growing as the orca swam\
  \ closer. The dorsal fin quivered slightly as it rose higher and higher, six or\
  \ eight feet above the water. Finally, the back of the whale broke the surface,\
  \ its shining black back with gleaming white saddle patches.  \n\nSwiftly and silently\
  \ the bull orca swam toward our bunched group of kayaks until when it seemed impossibly\
  \ close, it gracefully dove, sinking as apparently effortless as it had risen, disappearing\
  \ barely a kayak length from the front-most boat in the group. We all sat there\
  \ speechless looking at the footprint left behind on the water.\n\nSuddenly a female\
  \ orca broke the surface to our left, swimming fast and diving again. An instant\
  \ later, another to our right, surfaced and dove. Our heads were swiveling from\
  \ one side to the other as other orcas in the pod rose, spouting and diving in rapid\
  \ succession on either side of us.\n\nAnd then it was over. The A16 pod was on its\
  \ way bound down the channel. For a few minutes we sat there stunned, talking quietly\
  \ to each other, but mostly just listening to the sound of the wind and the water,\
  \ trying to take in what we had just seen."
