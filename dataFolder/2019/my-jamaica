Text: "I would like to tell you the story of when I traveled to Jamaica.  Honestly\
  \ if I could choose all three of these selections I would.  My trip to Jamaica was\
  \ literally a leap into the unknown, and I made many local connections.  I also\
  \ didn't expect to find many amazing aspects that Jamaica had.  It was the first\
  \ time that I had traveled to another country.  I was ecstatic, and a little nervous\
  \ to tell you the truth.  This is the unknown -it was a new territory that I had\
  \ never seen before or experienced.  I was able to drink legally and I was eighteen\
  \ at the time.  So that was the unknown for me as well.  I felt that I was doing\
  \ something wrong but it was so right.  To be able to take that first drink of pina\
  \ colada on the pool side was pure bliss.  \n\nThe many local connections I was\
  \ able to make was all around me.  I remember going with my mom down to the ocean\
  \ at the resort we were in.  There were two women working on your hair, and we decided\
  \ for them to braid our hair.  It was a long and relaxing moment having the women\
  \ converse in their language.  It was interesting to hear and almost like music.\
  \  While sitting in the ocean you could see the water through like glass it was\
  \ so beautiful.  Another local connection I was able to make was with horseback\
  \ riding in the country side.  We were able to see the poverty part of Jamaica.\
  \  That was a truly different experience that I will cherish.  Walking through their\
  \ lives on horses and just being able to see their lives was extraordinary.  I saw\
  \ colorful clothes like a rainbow on a drying rack.  I saw women and children outside\
  \ practically naked.  I didn't realize how the people of Jamaica had lived.  But\
  \ it was fascinating. That was their normal but it was a blessing to be able to\
  \ be apart of it and to walk into their lives for a brief moment.  I was forever\
  \ grateful.\n\nI didn't expect to find myself doing things differently in a country.\
  \  I was eighteen and graduating high school at the time.  I without a doubt found\
  \ myself while in Jamaica.  I found myself closer to my family which I wasn't really.\
  \  It was a time to reconnect us as a family.  We seemed to have lost that aspect.\
  \  In Jamaica a lot of the people felt like your family.  You felt like you were\
  \ apart of something magical and you didn't want to let that go.  I didn't expect\
  \ to find how truly beautiful Jamaica was.  The people were beautiful, the culture\
  \ was contagious and the food was amazing.  I even found myself doing things I wouldn't\
  \ normally would be doing.  I swam with dolphins and sting rays! I rode horseback\
  \ in the water.  I even danced with the Jamaicans.  How inviting these people of\
  \ Jamaica were.  You really felt like you were home in Jamaica and you didn't want\
  \ to leave.  If I were to be chosen for this I would experience all of these aspects.\
  \  It really is a leap into the unknown, you make many local connections with the\
  \ people all around you.  They are there and handing you this magical opportunity.\
  \ And you find something that you didn't think you were looking for.  I can't ever\
  \ fit something this big into just one category.  I want to take it all in.  Because\
  \ I believe that is where your experiences lie."
