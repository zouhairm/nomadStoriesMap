Text: "When people would ask me \"why Belize?\" I never knew quite what to say. This\
  \ wasn't a country that topped popular travel lists and the most common associations\
  \ were with its crime-ridden capital. For someone whose travel log largely comprised\
  \ of charming, lavish, and relatively safe streets in Europe, I won't deny that\
  \ I was going into the adventure with some hesitation. My first stop, after a quick\
  \ pass-though Belize City, was San Ignacio, a small town only miles away from the\
  \ Guatemalan border that was a base for the daring and curious - Mayan ruins, cave\
  \ tubbing, and tour of an iguana sanctuary were on the itinerary and I couldn't\
  \ wait to explore. This was my first foray into Mayan culture and it was truly like\
  \ stepping back in time. Making our way across the sprawling archaeological site\
  \ named Xunantunich (\"Sculpture of Lady\" in the Mayan language), I couldn't help\
  \ but wonder about the centuries it took to build something so grandiose and culturally\
  \ significant. Every stone carving had a meaning, every step had a purpose. The\
  \ stories of rituals, sacrifices, and the first \"technological\" advances were\
  \ endless. This was truly a civilization that was ahead of its time. Nevertheless,\
  \ it was easy to forget that only days prior I was in a modern city where the oldest\
  \ monument was less than 400 years old. \n\nAfter a day filled with architecture\
  \ and history, I was excited to explore jungle which drew me to Belize in the first\
  \ place. I've never been an adrenaline junky but the rainforest had a special place\
  \ in my heart, and the ability to explore it on both land and water was impossible\
  \ to pass up. After being handed gear and a tube, we made our 1 mile trek through\
  \ the dense vegetation, stopping along the way to learn about how Mayans used various\
  \ plants and trees as food, building materials, and even medicine. When the tour\
  \ guide picked a small bug off of a tree and mentioned it was a good source of protein,\
  \ we scrunched up our noses and proceeded to eat it with a mix of curiosity and\
  \ disgust. Next, we found ourselves battling the currant as we crossed the river,\
  \ clutching onto our tubes lest they float away. It was not until we go to the mouth\
  \ of the cave that we could truly relax. We floated through one of the most beautiful\
  \ spectacles I've encountered - mysterious, shimmering, and a bit eerie, the cave\
  \ offered a tranquility that hard to find elsewhere. We ended the trip by jumping\
  \ off small cliffs into the water, a 10,000 year old sinkhole like a halo above\
  \ our heads. \n\nAnd after several days of adventure, I was off to the island of\
  \ Caye (pronounced \"key\") Caulker for some much needed relaxation. Having spent\
  \ my entire life in the city, islands were a fascination of mine. The palm trees,\
  \ soft-sand beaches, and laid back culture meshed well with my care-free personality.\
  \ I didn't mind that service was slow and that start times were mere suggestions.\
  \ I drank out of freshly cut coconuts on the beach, swam in the lukewarm water of\
  \ the Carribean sea, and ate as much seafood as I could (did someone say ceviche?).\
  \ But I didn't part ways with Belize without one final adventure - snorkeling! While\
  \ this may not be a huge undertaking for many, this was my first time exploring\
  \ the underwater world. It took a few minutes to get used to the snorkel but once\
  \ I did, I couldn't tear my eyes away. The reef was like another planet, every curve\
  \ and corner revealing a new plant or fish. I came within feet of sharks and stingray\
  \ and even caught a few snappers which we later cooked into a delicious meal. By\
  \ the end of the week, I felt like a native, adopting the island motto \"go slow\"\
  \ and tucking into my back pocket for a day when I felt like the world was moving\
  \ to fast."
