Text: "\u201CThe cooking spatula the women use here is sacred, and if they curse their\
  \ husbands with it, the man becomes infertile. So all the women went to the streets\
  \ with the spatula in their hands\u201D, Leila says. My twenty-year-old interpreter\
  \ is talking about the most influential demonstration in the history of Burkina\
  \ Faso, one that lasted only few days in October 2014. It resulted in the now ex-president,\
  \ who had ruled the county for 27 years, fleeing to the Ivory Coast and leaving\
  \ his burned-down palace behind. We are staring at the ruins of the charred building\
  \ while standing on the sandy, wide sidewalk of the Avenue de l\u2019Independence,\
  \ one of the main axes that crosses the capital city of Ouagadougou. We can hardly\
  \ hear each other due to the roaring engines of countless scooters on the street.\
  \ \u201CSo\u201D, I say, \u201Cthe big step towards a democratic change was taken\
  \ with the help of women\u201D, feeling deeply connected and also proud to be talking\
  \ to one of them. She nods, her eyes misty, but adds that it is still complicated.\
  \ She reminds me of the recent terror attacks, one of which hit a caf\xE9 and a\
  \ hotel in the centre, not even 2 kilometres away from our spot. \u201CIt is believed\
  \ that the responsible group was negotiating with the former president about the\
  \ international military bases and..\u201D I am confused. Again.\n\nI have been\
  \ confused since I started traveling around the country with my small filming team\
  \ three weeks ago. Nothing I experience here is ordinary or similar to anything\
  \ I know from my sterile and spoiled Western life. Take any condition you can think\
  \ of. Reverse it. That is Burkina Faso. Two seasons a year, one meal per day, three\
  \ wives per man, zero shoes and one used t-shirt per child, eighty-one ethnicities\
  \ and languages in one country, three main religions (each resembling one another),\
  \ seventy illiterate women out of one hundred, one revolution and one independence\
  \ leader for a country of eight million people\u2014the one, who renamed the former\
  \ French colony of Upper Volta in Moor\xE9, the local language, calling it \u201C\
  the land of the upright man\u201D. There have also been many assassinations over\
  \ twenty-seven years, including that beloved leader\u2019s in 1987, by his childhood\
  \ friend and comrade \u201Cthe fugitive president\u201D.\n\nWe get back to the car.\
  \ There is no chance of entering the former palace, which is surrounded by barbed\
  \ wire. Nor could our drone get any signals for some aerial views. A famous Burkinab\xE9\
  \ architect, whose works will be soon displayed in the exhibition I am curating\
  \ in Munich, designed the new parliament building to be built on this spot, but\
  \ I do not care. What matters more is his completed school projects in the villages.\
  \ What really matters is that the children do not need to walk kilometres anymore\
  \ to be able to reach their schools, like the architect had to do in the 1970s,\
  \ when 90 percent of the population was illiterate. \n\nI am happy to leave Ouagadougou\
  \ behind, with its fat politician posing on huge advertisement boards, waving to\
  \ the people awkwardly. Reaching the countryside\u2014the savannah\u2014to meet\
  \ hundreds of cheerful children makes our day. The eucalyptus shell and the local\
  \ laterite stone fa\xE7ade of the most recent school of the architect blend with\
  \ the reddish topography. It is lunchtime. Leila starts talking to a student in\
  \ French and finishes in Moor\xE9. It is only for one student, C\xE9cile, that I\
  \ do not need Leila. C\xE9cile speaks very good English compared to her classmates.\
  \ She has deep calluses on her skin and cuts on the fingertips of her hands and\
  \ feet. I hear that she works in the field to support her family. She is 13 years\
  \ old. I have to forget everything I think I know about life in the land of the\
  \ upright man. C\xE9cile holds out the metal plate to me. It is Benga couscous,\
  \ the local beans and rice. \u201CYou are invited.\u201D Eating with my ten fingers\
  \ I feel complete. The lesson of my life is hidden in the Moor\xE9. Fom be ti mam\
  \ be. I am because you are."
