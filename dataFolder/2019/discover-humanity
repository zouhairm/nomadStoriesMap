Text: "The city sure has lights, glory, huge buildings and people, so many people!\
  \ Yet, in a hugely populated city, I felt alone. I was too scared to make new friends\
  \ due to the newpaper- the scary news of murders and rapes had made me lose my faith\
  \ in humanity. \nOne day, my sister asked me to travel to Kerala with her. I went\
  \ to Munnar, a small hill station admist trees, birds and hills. We lived in a cottage\
  \ and after days, I could feel my lungs breathe the fresh air, I could hear the\
  \ music of water from the falls and the birds chirping. I could see the million\
  \ stars that I could never see in the city. I asked them to switch on the fans and\
  \ they shocked me by saying that the only source of electricity they had was the\
  \ bulb and the weather never demanded anything more. I was too high maintenance\
  \ to eat outside, anything oily or unhealthy. My weak body ashamed myself and I\
  \ fell down almost losing my senses due to starvation. I was wearing a crop top\
  \ and the locals lifted me up to a shade and covered my belly with a shirt and made\
  \ me drink a local energy drink and water. I felt better and tried a local 'thali'.\
  \ They were extremely pleased to see me with good health again. We booked an auto\
  \ who took us to places for visit and he was extremely polite and warm, he waited\
  \ while we shopped and took selfies and didn't charge extra. \nOne evening, we were\
  \ wandering around and I was scared as it was dark. While walking, we saw a hut\
  \ with people and lights, we went in thinking it as a public place. An old couple\
  \ saw us sneaking and invited us in to the crowd with extreme warmth and I doubted\
  \ as this had happened to me in pubs too. However, I was shocked to see that it\
  \ was a wedding! We said that we are strangers but they said that 'Atithi Devo Bhava'\
  \ and 'please bless the newly married'. I couldn't believe in the warmth of people.\
  \ They made us sit, eat and treated like we were their family members. We felt extremely\
  \ warm, welcomed but ashamed too cause we didn't have any gift to present them.\
  \ We however took pictures with them to share on our social media to let the world\
  \ bless them. \nThat was our last night in Munnar and alas! How that place made\
  \ me believe in humanity again! Away from the fear of crimes, hatred and politics,\
  \ their existed such people who love people. I shall always cherish the human love\
  \ and bond I found there even between strangers. I discovered humanity in Munnar.\
  \ They all waved us goodbye as we went around. We had to leave early in the morning\
  \ and suddenly, the Auto driver stopped in a small shop and we were worried for\
  \ the reason. However, he had stopped to buy us vada and banana fries as, We couldn't\
  \ have breakfast. I couldn't have felt more loved and cared for. \nIf you are a\
  \ pessimist like me and if you believe that humanity doesn't exist, then do visit\
  \ Munnar, Kerala, India.\n\n-Soumyaa Satarupa Sahoo"
