Text: "It wasn't feeling jovial after a streak of report submissions and deadlines\
  \ to be met and a failed look for cheaper flight deals to nearby capital cities\
  \ in Europe which cajoled me to comprehend a boring Christmas in Hamburg itself\
  \ which out of nowhere as a Baltic phenomenon was experiencing ungracious rainfall\
  \ intermittently .Then came the breakthrough that a friend introduced me to a mobile\
  \ application called 'Bla Bla' car which is basically a sort of Car pooling facilitator\
  \ between the unknown travellers to a common destination and bang ! I had a travel\
  \ plan .\n\nMoments after I got a deal to make a road trip to Prague all the way\
  \ from Hamburg ,roped in my cousin from Dresden to meet me on the way and off I\
  \ was ready for a stress busting trip to the city of Music lovers , most sought\
  \ after destination by Bollywood freaks such as me as their travel destination thanks\
  \ to it being a shooting choice by many a performing directors from the Industry\
  \ in Mumbai ,India .\n\nFor what I thought could be a stress buster trip ,it of\
  \ late turned out to be a recuperating one without even a visit to the spa ,the\
  \ December breeze across the Vlatav river ,a continuous stroll across the centuries\
  \ old Charles bridge and those moments of climbing up the hill to the castle and\
  \ one of the tallest pieces of Church architecture ,the Saint Vitus Cathedral was\
  \ worth the pain to climb up .Never elsewhere could I experience the joy of being\
  \ lost in the past as we made several a trip across from the central part of the\
  \ city to a quaint & happening Hotel in the middle of the city using the tram jostling\
  \ across zig zag pathways and uneven elevations marked by tracks layed on those\
  \ old brick stone combinations.\n\nWith no offense intended to the typical German\
  \ cuisine \nThe Czech mulled wine ,'Sva\u0159\xE1k' turned out to be an utmost delight\
  \ both for the blocked nose as well as a pain reliever whilst strolling across narrow\
  \ streets in and around the Tyne Church and the Old city Hall .Saying so a must\
  \ suggestion for future travellers would be to book in advance a ride to the top\
  \ of the Old City hall tower through the website instead of having to wait in a\
  \ queue for the view from the top \nwhich is worth the Koruna.\nLocals suggested\
  \ us to try Bohemian wine and Dumplings with Pork and Sauerkraut which absolutely\
  \ was an appetizer,healer and spicy delight and we had it at the historic restaurant\
  \ 'Cafe Louvre' once graced by Sir Albert Einstein.\n\nAnd though I was selfish\
  \ enough to curse the fact that I couldn't attend a planned event at the National\
  \ Theatre of Music yet the inner view was just awesome ,it's charm left us to delve\
  \ into the metronome music which to this day remains as a playlist in my Spotify'\
  \ library.\n\nAs time was nearing to bid adieu to the city ,I decided to grace it\
  \ with a moment of silence from atop the Vrtba Gardens by allowing myself to be\
  \ lost in the serenity of nature by the joy of realisation the societal growth and\
  \ civilization built upon this old and historic city through legends who fostered\
  \ love amidst turbulent temptations to overpower and tear.The bridge view from atop\
  \ reminded of the necessity of travel and self rewarding ventures which not only\
  \ made me lose more of my stress yet healed up the strain being created as we strive\
  \ to surpass time through innovation abound .\n\nThis relationship hatched with\
  \ the city shall remind me that what we build for others shall remain revered and\
  \ cherished with a healing touch on its own and what we amass narcissistically for\
  \ our own extravagant desires are reduced to ruins .\n\nIndeed Praha healed a many\
  \ and so was I ,refreshed with my ambitions which was reset with a topping of Love\
  \ ,the city of music had cast a spell with her beer ,her air and her elevations\
  \ that soon shall bring me back to her till I find someone to make her jealous or\
  \ to tread Her with her.\nWhat a Christmas 2018"
