Text: "School work is the last thing anyone thinks about when they apply for a study\
  \ aboard program, but that\u2019s what I found myself doing as I waited for a decent\
  \ hour to skype with my family. Homesickness had been creeping up on me in my first\
  \ few weeks in Wales, and I needed a diversion.\nA quick knock on my door was followed\
  \ by Phil, one of my flatmates. \u201CWill\u2019s made some dinner for everyone,\
  \ if you want to join. There\u2019s a pub quiz at eight that we\u2019re all going\
  \ down for too. Interested?\u201D\nI had no idea what a pub quiz was, but I joined\
  \ my flatmates for dinner anyway and was immediately inducted into the weekly supper\
  \ club. What that meant was that I would be in charge of dinner for everyone in\
  \ a few weeks\u2019 time, but that was a bridge to be crossed when I got there.\
  \ That night was for Will\u2019s delicious butternut squash soup and my introduction\
  \ to pub quizzes.\n\u201CI can\u2019t promise I\u2019ll be any help to you,\u201D\
  \ I was forced to disclaim, but no one seemed terribly bothered by my possible lack\
  \ of contribution. \n\u201CIt\u2019s just a fun thing we do as a flat,\u201D Phil\
  \ assured me as we migrated from the dorm to Bar Uno. \u201CIt\u2019s not really\
  \ that competitive.\u201D\nBar Uno was the international student hangout. The 70\u2019\
  s orange couches were comfortable, you could watch television, and sometimes you\
  \ could dance without having to pay a cover charge like you did at the club downtown.\
  \ On pub quiz nights though, Bar Uno felt more like a traditional English pub; quietly\
  \ chatty and cozy. \nWe all placed an order at the bar and claimed a table. Phil\
  \ wrinkled his nose in disappointment and disgust when a waiter brought me a mug\
  \ of hot chocolate. \u201CWhy?\u201D\n\u201CI don\u2019t drink,\u201D I answered\
  \ honestly, stirring the whipped cream with the complimentary chocolate flake. The\
  \ quiz started before Phil or any of the rest of my flatmates could start lecturing\
  \ me on my poor life choices. \nThe first round was 25 random trivia questions,\
  \ and I wasn\u2019t as complete rubbish as I\u2019d feared, so come the first break,\
  \ we were tied for first with two other teams. \n\u201CWe\u2019re going to take\
  \ short break everyone, but we\u2019re also going to start round two,\u201D the\
  \ MC announced. \u201CFlip over your papers and list as many of the 50 states of\
  \ America as you can. You have fifteen minutes.\u201D \nI extended my hand for the\
  \ pencil as all eyes at the table turned to me; I had 49 written down before five\
  \ minutes had passed, but that was the best I could do, because an hour of thinking\
  \ was not going to help me remember Missouri (sorry Missouri). I wallowed in silent\
  \ shame through the rest of the break until the second-round scores were announced,\
  \ because thanks to the 49 I could remember and a stellar showing in the final round,\
  \ we smoked the competition anyway. \n\u201CYou\u2019re coming next week, right?\u201D\
  \ Phil asked excitedly as the two of us headed back to the dorm; I\u2019d wanted\
  \ to call my parents to tell them about my new trivia skills, and he had dorm warden\
  \ duties to attend to. \u201CWe\u2019ve never done so well before. You have to come\
  \ from now on.\u201D\n\u201CObviously I\u2019m coming next week. But we\u2019ll\
  \ never get that lucky with a round again.\u201D\n\u201CDoesn\u2019t matter, you\u2019\
  re part of the team now.\u201D\nThat warmed me right up, and it put me in my place.\
  \ I hadn\u2019t come to Wales to sit in my room and feel homesick. So just like\
  \ that, just like hopping a train on the weekends in search of castles would become\
  \ my thing, the Thursday pub quiz with my flatmates became as essential as going\
  \ to classes every day.\nThe following week, Phil bought me my signature drink,\
  \ a single hot chocolate with whipped cream. \u201CLet\u2019s see if you can lead\
  \ us to victory again with that.\u201D"
