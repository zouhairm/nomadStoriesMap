Text: "Blackness all around. Except a few shimmering lights. It\u2019s kind of like\
  \ space. Or being born. Or being born in space.\n\nI was a breech birth baby, so\
  \ falling backwards out of things is not unfamiliar to me. This time however, I\
  \ had a little more agency and tumbled out with mask and tank full of air. I arrived\
  \ on the dive boat a couple of days ago, happy to turn my time wandering around\
  \ Queensland farms into a trip at the Great Barrier Reef.\n\nCuriously, I ended\
  \ up as the sole chef on the vessel. While I\u2019d worked in kitchens before, \u201D\
  chef\u201D is not on my resume. I was unprepared for it. There actually wasn\u2019\
  t a resume involved. Or any real evaluation at all. The specific question posed\
  \ to me was \u201CDo you know how to cook?\u201D And while I can answer yes to that\
  \ question, it\u2019s quite a different skill set to feed 80 people three meals\
  \ a day. I was unaware that this was an interview.\n\nSomething about a bong being\
  \ stored in the hull of the ship. The previous chef was leaving immediately. I would\
  \ get a bunk in the living quarters. I think he left me a hit. I had about 10 hours\
  \ to learn how to be a chef and be filling in indefinitely. I wish I had brought\
  \ more underwear.\n\nWith my newfound authority (chefs rank much closer to captain\
  \ than I realized), I was also looked at as someone who knows the waters well, so\
  \ I had a little leeway in when I get to dive. Usually you need around 50 dives\
  \ before night diving. Because I was unlikely to get that many dives in in the next\
  \ week or so, I figured I should take advantage of the opportunity while I had it.\
  \ \n\nShimmering scales, from flashes of flashlights from the hands of a handful\
  \ of divers. Manta Ray Bay, (pretty sure that\u2019s a level in Super Mario), is\
  \ being descended upon by some of the crew and experienced divers. And me. \n\n\
  Although initially quite unsettled by the all-encompassing void, eventually I became\
  \ comfortable with the unknown. Bundles of jackfish and occasional reef shark would\
  \ dart into view. Sleeping sea turtles nestled among the coral. As a neoprene dirigible,\
  \ I came to feel just as at ease. Body and water temperature equalizing, I acknowledged\
  \ myself as just another plankton in an infinitely larger ocean.\n\nWhich made it\
  \ awful hard to get out and back to work the next morning.\n\nI quickly went from\
  \ \u201Cchef\u201D to \u201Ccheffie\u201D, the endearing Australian diminutive signaling\
  \ my place among the crew. And each day filled with new aquatic experiences. I got\
  \ lost following a stingray, stung by an enthusiastic jellyfish, and sang Sting\
  \ songs at sunset.\n\nI\u2019ll reiterate, I can cook, but I\u2019m not a chef.\
  \ Inventory, scaling recipes, managing volunteer dishwashers, these activities are\
  \ not in my wheelhouse. And while I think I did a decent job, there were certainly\
  \ a few hiccups. I had to convert my chocolate cake into a sugary ice cream topping\
  \ after miscalculating the increased dosage. I\u2019m American, metric isn\u2019\
  t in my lexicon. \n\n13 days later I\u2019m back on land and feeling good. New job\
  \ with new friends, zero cost of living, and great pay. I drop by the dive office\
  \ and we exchange stacks of paperwork to make the deal official. I spend the weekend\
  \ with my new mates getting to know Cairns.\n\nMonday night I return to the docks\
  \ to head out on another stint of chefdom. With a full stock of underwear, I pass\
  \ by twinkling masts of moored ships. I hop on the boat and sign in. But before\
  \ we leave the skipper jumps down to talk to me. Apparently, I\u2019m not supposed\
  \ to be on the boat. I call the office.\n\n\u201CWe have a chef on board now, we\u2019\
  ll no longer require your help\u201D. This is business speak for \u201CWe\u2019\
  ve replaced you\u201D. Turns out, a random customer with no qualifications and no\
  \ formal training wasn\u2019t an ideal cook. As quickly as I found employment, I\
  \ have lost it. \n\nI stumble back out onto the dock. Blackness all around. Except\
  \ a few shimmering lights."
