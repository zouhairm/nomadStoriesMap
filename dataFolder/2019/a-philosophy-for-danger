Text: "The U.S. Bureau of Consular Affairs has my number, my address, and my intentions.\
  \ We engage in a symbiotic relationship. I tell them where I\u2019m going, and their\
  \ Smart Traveler Enrollment Program (STEP) warns me of impending danger. Thanks\
  \ to STEP, I\u2019ve avoided a Congolese protest in the streets of Paris, a demonstration\
  \ in Budapest, and voting in Iceland. When I decided to visit Japan in 2017, North\
  \ Korea and the U.S. were engaged in a shouting match over bombing Guam. With Japan\
  \ sandwiched between their fight, I decided to let STEP know exactly where I was\
  \ going.\n\nOctober in Japan is usually bright and sunny, yet I arrived on a Sunday\
  \ to find the famous neon lights of Shibuya blurred by chilly rain. With a soundtrack\
  \ of crows cawing atop Torii gates, I meandered among temples and coffee shops,\
  \ my Irish ancestry pleased by the gloomy weather. A little water never hurt anyone.\
  \ By Friday, STEP advised me otherwise. \n\nSuper Typhoon Lan was curling up the\
  \ pacific with an eye for Tokyo. I repeated the word in my head. Typhoon. The hurricane\
  \ of the Northwestern Pacific Ocean. A term synonymous with death and destruction.\
  \ \n\n\u201CPay attention to local news,\u201D STEP said. \u201CListen to local\
  \ authorities. Be prepared.\u201D\n\n\u201CTyphoon preparation\u201D is a phrase\
  \ as foreign to me as Japanese. I was by no means ready for a natural event of this\
  \ caliber, so I instantly clicked on the news. I didn\u2019t know the language,\
  \ but I was sure I could read the expressions of the local news team to gauge the\
  \ danger. \nA meteorologist waved his hand over an animated cyclone, while the news\
  \ team stared at him as if they were watching paint dry.  When one anchor asked\
  \ about tsunamis, no one flinched. The meteorologist responded casually and the\
  \ show moved on to a segment about an island where visitors could play with civilized\
  \ wild rabbits. The news team laughed as one of their own chased a fluffy rabbit\
  \ in the rain.\n \nHad STEP been wrong about the danger? Why was everyone so moot\
  \ about doom?\n\nThe night of the typhoon, I lay awake, waiting for the window to\
  \ blow in, a surge of water to rise, an announcement in Japanese to be yelled down\
  \ the hallway. In the U.S., we\u2019d have piled up sandbags, stocked fresh water,\
  \ evacuated. \n\nThe next morning, I turned on the news expecting to find a city\
  \ out of Revelations. Sun reflected off skyscrapers. Streets shone clean and brilliant.\
  \ A few buildings stood crumbling, but as authorities worked on damage control,\
  \ people bustled around as if it was just another Tuesday. \n\nOver a Buddhist lunch\
  \ of bamboo shoots and steamed rice, I asked a local about the typhoon. She shrugged.\
  \ \u201CYes, it\u2019s been really rainy, but we love it, because then we have an\
  \ excuse to go to Onsen.\u201D \n\nI hadn\u2019t expected this response, but I understood.\
  \ The danger had been real, but in the eyes of the Japanese, they could do nothing\
  \ about it except to find the good in the situation. STEP could tell me when and\
  \ where the danger would be, but only I could manage my fear when facing it. Perhaps\
  \ if I had possessed a philosophy as simple as enjoying a hot bath, the danger would\
  \ have seemed as gentle to me as an island of rabbits."
