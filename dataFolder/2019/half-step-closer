Text: "\"Half-Step Closer\"\n\n\tDespite the loneliness I felt in Genova that morning,\
  \ I praised the emptiness of Italy\u2019s Cinque Terre National Park. Even the trekking\
  \ pass kiosks outside Riomaggiore sat empty. The fog sank down the terraced hillside\
  \ and out to sea. \n\n\t\u201CBuongiorno\u201D was all I spoke for hours, but by\
  \ noon the crowds tramped the slopes. I broke from the dirt trail and took my shoes\
  \ off in the shade. A young couple stopped near me. The woman\u2019s blonde ponytail\
  \ ran between her sunburnt shoulder blades, and the man brushed his black hair from\
  \ his forehead, his Mediterranean tan like a bruised pear. They split a protein\
  \ bar without speaking, then they moved on, their swishy athletic shorts leaving\
  \ me to the quiet where I ate an apple and napped. \n\n\tBack on the trail and making\
  \ my own time, I met the couple on an exposed cliff pass \u2013 green above, rock\
  \ below, and blue fading out for miles. \u201CLet\u2019s let her pass,\u201D the\
  \ woman said, and the swish of their shorts slowed. \u201CCan I get some water?\u201D\
  \ she asked. The man held his space on the trail, and I toed past, a half-step closer\
  \ to sea and sky and falling. I could still hear them, his voice carried. \u201C\
  You wouldn\u2019t survive one day without me,\u201D he said. \u201CNo water, no\
  \ pack, no sunscreen.\u201D His voice was thick like the afternoon heat. \u201C\
  You don\u2019t even have pockets,\u201D he huffed. \n\tI stopped. She was drinking\
  \ from the bottle, head tipped back, skin sweaty but smooth and unperturbed. Pockets\
  \ solved few problems. Walking has solved many more. \n\n\tIn Vernazza, the houses\
  \ on the hillsides and around the inlet are painted the colors of ripe fruit. Surrounded\
  \ by families and couples, I waded into the water with my boots tied to my backpack.\
  \ I had no one to watch them. \n\n\tThe train platform in Levanto was a concrete\
  \ slab nestled in a steep-walled valley. I stank and I knew it. I sat next to a\
  \ young man but left space between us. He was bent at the waist, fingers twisted\
  \ in his black hair. \n\tShe came from the postcard stand, shorts swishing as she\
  \ approached. She stopped in front of him. \u201CBabe,\u201D she said gently, \u201C\
  Scooch so I can sit next to you.\u201D From the hollow of his curved body, he said,\
  \ \u201CI have never met a needier person in my life.\u201D She walked away, crying\
  \ and curling into herself.\n\tWhen I set out that morning, I planned to stay until\
  \ evening, watch the painted houses glow with new color, and the sun melt into the\
  \ sea. I didn't need romanticism but I didn't need this either."
