Text: "The smell of fire burning from a distance fills the atmosphere like incense.\
  \ Except there is a stench to it that makes the air stale. There is no vegetation\
  \ left to burn, only the remnants of that which has already been burned. The arid\
  \ heat never ceases to fill the volume of the small town called Vaalwater, located\
  \ in the northern province of South Africa. This is my home for the next three months,\
  \ where I had gone as a volunteer to teach the children in villages outlined by\
  \ decades of apartheid. \n     In a bare classroom with only desks and chairs for\
  \ the students and a chalkboard for myself, I was told not to leave any chalks behind.\
  \ After a short break in between classes, I had returned to nubs on the chalkboard\
  \ ledge that have been chewed off on both ends. As I stood there holding what was\
  \ left of the chalk, I remembered it was just the other day the same children caught\
  \ flying ants the size of a finger, twisting off their ends and popping them into\
  \ their mouths. The squeamish feeling I had then dissolved the moment I realized\
  \ that their real hunger was not for knowledge but for food. \n     The route to\
  \ school was not entirely paved and there were points I had to dismount my bike\
  \ to walk through the burning sand. My shoes would become so unbearably hot that\
  \ I had thought I would be better off without them. One day I set out barefoot like\
  \ the rest of the villagers, only to find myself hopscotching hopelessly to a patch\
  \ of shade. The one good thing that had come from that attempt was that a wart latched\
  \ onto my foot for a year had fallen off and never grew back. \n     I figured since\
  \ there was not much I could do to feed all of the hungry children, I would at least\
  \ save their feet from the scorching grounds. So I gathered pieces of cardboard\
  \ from my host\u2019s garage, strapped them onto my back with ropes and eagerly\
  \ biked to school. I had taken a pair of scissors and a handful of rubber bands\
  \ with me to have them make sandals with the cardboard. I had traced their feet\
  \ onto the cardboard and cut them out to size, strung the rubber bands onto them\
  \ to create straps for their feet. But it was only moments before the makeshift\
  \ sandals would fall apart and their calloused feet would be back to traversing\
  \ the earth with nothing in between.   \n     With the remainder of the cardboard\
  \ and rubber bands, I had the students make wrist watches to teach them to read\
  \ the time. However, it was futile effort to teach the concept of time to a group\
  \ of children whose only real interest was in having pictures taken of themselves,\
  \ flashing their newly made watches. They got up on top of their desks, strategically\
  \ stacking themselves on top of each other as they posed to have themselves captured\
  \ by my camera. They lived for the moment and time served no purpose.    \n    \
  \ As a farewell gift to my students, I took photographs of each of them. I traveled\
  \ for hours by bus to a larger town to get the pictures developed, but to me it\
  \ was worth it knowing that for the most of them, this may be the only picture they\
  \ would ever have of themselves. So I wanted to give them something tangible as\
  \ a memento of our time, something of more value than makeshift sandals and cardboard\
  \ watches. \n     Though I was saddened to part ways, I was ready to see the faces\
  \ of my students light up one last time as they would take in the images of themselves.\
  \ But when I had them gather around me, they grabbed the photographs from my hand,\
  \ ravenously tore them into fragmented pieces and chewed away the glossy papers\
  \ before engulfing them. I stood in utter shock as they looked up at me with smiles\
  \ stretched across their faces. And in that moment, they made me realize that just\
  \ like hunger, the true value of life is not in the tangible nor is it measurable\
  \ by time."
