Text: "French Kiss\n\nIn a side chapel of the Saint-Pierre de Montmartre church in\
  \ Paris, I collide with a couple kissing emphatically. Muttering in French, a grey-haired\
  \ man clings to his paramour, caressing her back and burying his face in her neck.\
  \ He comes up for air and then immediately drops audible kisses on her shoulder,\
  \ forehead, lips. I hold my hand up in apology and take a couple of steps backward,\
  \ but they continue to titter and gasp, pawing at each other\u2019s clothes. The\
  \ woman, her long blond hair also streaked with grey, protests: \u2018No, no. Oh,\
  \ no.\u2019 It\u2019s breathless and desperate, and clearly, she doth protest too\
  \ much. \n\nWhen I realise I\u2019m staring at them, my mouth hanging open, I turn\
  \ quickly and walk down the nave. I focus instead, on the church interior. Roman-origin\
  \ columns, fine brickwork, a perfectly lovely baptismal font. Look at that sublime\
  \ vaulting. And the gorgeous blues and golds of Christ, arms open, gazing serenely\
  \ from the ceiling over the altar. Light a candle. Light another.  \n\nOut of the\
  \ corner of my eye, the couple continue to kiss, as though they were laying on the\
  \ banks of the Seine at dawn, after a long night of drinking and dancing. They look\
  \ for all the world as though they are settling in for the afternoon, spending their\
  \ last day together.  As though they\u2019ve found each other again after decades\
  \ apart, and they\u2019ve saved up all their passion for this moment and won\u2019\
  t contain it any longer. \n\nThis church is just meters away from its more famous\
  \ relative, the 19th century Sacr\xE9-Coeur. The latter is a showgirl, all white\
  \ glitz and glamour compared to this austere woman. Much better suited to the romantic\
  \ antics of a middle-aged couple. Here the presence of nuns silently carrying out\
  \ their devotional work still feels pressed into the flagstones, the wooden pews,\
  \ and the altar. It is, without apology, a sombre place to pray and contemplate\
  \ God. \n\nOr so I think.\n\nAnd yet, when I tilt my head around a column I gasp\
  \ as I watch her handbag fall from her shoulder and her dress slide up her thigh.\
  \ The man presses her up against a low balustrade and she is bent backwards at a\
  \ surprisingly lithe angle, running her fingers through his thinning hair. Their\
  \ kisses are no longer just playful. His hands firmly grasp her bottom.\n\nI slip\
  \ quietly into a pew, abandon subtlety, and resort to bare-faced staring as their\
  \ clinch becomes dangerously vigorous. She throws her head back and laughs, throaty\
  \ and high pitched at once. She persists with \u2018noooo\u2019, but it\u2019s a\
  \ sigh of delight and abandon. She shrieks as they stagger sideways and save each\
  \ other from falling to the ground. They collapse into laugher, straighten their\
  \ clothes and resume their kiss. \n\nI look up to see a life-size statue of Saint\
  \ Anthony sitting in a niche. He is pursing his lips in disapproval. I look back\
  \ at him with an involuntary shrug. He glares back. I don\u2019t dare look at the\
  \ Christ on the Cross in case he smites me for bearing witness. Uncannily, the baby\
  \ in Saint Anthony\u2019s arms is pointing directly at the smooching couple, smiling\
  \ gleefully. \n\nI am looking at them a little too wistfully. \n\nA pale middle-aged\
  \ couple stumble across them in surprise, as I had. They quickly back away, looking\
  \ incredulously at each other. The woman flushes pink and fusses with her glasses.\
  \ The man puts a protective arm around his wife and leads her towards a side chapel.\
  \ He catches my eye and shake his heads. I raise my eyebrows. \n\nBut in truth,\
  \ I\u2019m starting to smile inside. There\u2019s something endearing about their\
  \ frankness. There\u2019s something familiar too, about their fondness for each\
  \ other, their longing and desire. The memory of touch.  \n\nI walk towards the\
  \ entrance, cross myself with holy water, half expecting it to burn through my skin,\
  \ and leave the couple to their clinch. On a winter\u2019s day in Paris I\u2019\
  m pleasantly warmed through, witnessing first hand, a French kiss."
