Text: "We left the hut as the sun rose. The crooked wooden structure, which teetered\
  \ precariously out over a rock cliff on the edge of Northern Lake Malawi, had sheltered\
  \ me and my partner from mosquitos and the dangerous African wildlife of my imagination\
  \ for the week. I felt a strange pang of loss to leave it empty, to be moving on\
  \ from the rural village where we\u2019d subsisted on beans, strong coffee and the\
  \ astonishing generosity of the villagers. \nThe lake water glittered brilliantly\
  \ in the sunlight. The only clue we weren\u2019t at the ocean was the peaks of the\
  \ Mozambique ranges smudged hazily in the distance, low on the horizon. Our goal\
  \ that day was to hike south along the lakeshore to the next large village, having\
  \ heard rumours of a peaceful beachfront retreat, before we started the chaotic\
  \ journey back into the country\u2019s capital, Lilongwe. \n\nWe hoisted our packs,\
  \ and children swarmed around us merrily, giggling and waving, dangling from our\
  \ limbs, imploring us for a hug. The village headman bid us farewell, loading us\
  \ up with biscuits and a glass bottle of cola. His gift and attentions left us flustered\
  \ and then ashamed, as we were nothing but fortunate travellers exploring his country;\
  \ we had done nothing deserving of such kindness. \n\nAs we ambled along the lakeshore,\
  \ I wondered about the origins of their generosity. Yesterday, he had sat with us\
  \ for hours under the shade of a baobab, talking without agenda, smiling broadly.\
  \ Food is scarce, that much we knew. The villagers depend on fishing the lake of\
  \ its many endemic species for survival, as monkeys often destroy their crops. There\
  \ was no running water, no electricity, meagre shelters, and very little in the\
  \ way of income, yet any individual would have shared their last bowl of maize,\
  \ and gladly. \n\nIt was a slow but pleasurable process to pass through the small\
  \ villages, many consisting of just 5 or so dwellings, as we were invited in for\
  \ coffee, interrogated in the friendliest of ways by inquisitive headmen, or dragged\
  \ off for a game of football with the kids. We accumulated an escort party as we\
  \ passed from village to village, as hoards of children scampered along behind us\
  \ singing, watching curiously, giggling. Everyone had time for us and for each other.\n\
  \nWe passed women wrapped in colourful fabrics with babies strapped to their persons\
  \ and kilos of maize meal stacked on their heads. Their approach was audible from\
  \ miles away \u2013 their loud happy chatter carrying easily over the peaceful countryside.\
  \ Each paused in their tracks to greet us. Once, a baby was pressed into my arms\
  \ as her mother rearranged her load. It was a delight to watch the joy and surprise\
  \ spread over people\u2019s faces as we attempted the basic greeting in the local\
  \ language, Tumbuka. Our supplementary communicative hand signals and exaggerated\
  \ facial expressions were received with hilarity and didn\u2019t deter anyone from\
  \ trying to communicate with us.\n\nSome six hours later, as we approached our destination,\
  \ a young girl ran screaming into a hut after seeing white faces for the first time.\
  \ The entire population of the village fell about with laughter at this display,\
  \ and we apologetically scuttled ahead. There was no offense taken, as the father\
  \ of the girl caught up with us, simply to show us the way to the beach hut and\
  \ teach us Tumbuka phrases. Fortunately, there was room for us at the hut \u2013\
  \ just pull up a mat on the sand. \n\nThat night, I lay on the sand and listened\
  \ to the lapping of the water and struggled to make sense of it all. Unconditional\
  \ trust and generosity radiated from the people of Malawi, despite living in one\
  \ of the poorest countries in Africa. The experience of being accepted and embraced\
  \ completely, without judgement, was so very foreign. It was a walk along a lake,\
  \ but it was also a humbling lesson in happiness."
