Text: "They say: nobody is the same after traveling. I totally agree with this statement\
  \ and the following essay will provide this idea.\nThere is nothing quite like traveling,\
  \ like seeing a new place for the first time or returning to a favorite place. People\
  \ of all ages, from all countries, travel to foreign places for many different reasons\
  \ \u2013 namely work, family and leisure. Whether by plane or automobile, travel\
  \ is generaat least for the people who can financially afford it. But it has more\
  \ benefits than satisfying one\u2019s need to make money, as well as to see loved\
  \ ones and enjoy one\u2019s self on vacation. There are other benefits of traveling\
  \ that many people often overlook.\nAnother great benefit to traveling is the life\
  \ experience. Many people in the world do not have the luxury of going to another\
  \ country for pleasure, or even to another city in their native country for that\
  \ matter.\nTraveling gets a person out of their comfort zone, away from all their\
  \ normal pleasures and comforts and way of doing things.\nThis forces them to be\
  \ adventurous, to live life to the fullest, to take the most of this precious gift\
  \ of life and use the time they have to discover new things, meet new people and\
  \ experience a completely different life \u2013 much like people experience when\
  \ reading fictional stories: They get to become whoever they are reading about,\
  \ just like in travel they get to become the citizens of the country they are visiting,\
  \ even if for just a short time. They live outside themselves.\n\nTraveling is good\
  \ for a person of any age. It not only helps people to form a better understanding\
  \ of themselves, their beliefs and their lives, it also provides people with a better\
  \ understanding of the world in which they live, even if it\u2019s beyond their\
  \ immediate environment. And it may even help a person to feel connected to the\
  \ many people living in the world, even if their lives never meet, even if their\
  \ lives are so completely different that they may as well be from different planets.\n\
  In 2013 and 2014 I have visited United States of America. This trip was so incredible\
  \ and unforgettable. I was traveling in California, Hawaii islands, and east coast.\
  \ The time I have spent there was brilliant and irreplaceable. I have met many friends\
  \ from all over the world.\nThe most precious moment of my traveling was visiting\
  \ Niagara Falls . The power of a nature, when you feel a part of this enormous world\
  \ gives you an impact and also a huge influence. Coming to that tour made me feel\
  \ so cheerful and gave so much energy to live my best life.\nI believe that life\
  \ is about constantly growing and learning, and personally, I feel by opening your\
  \ mind to unfamiliarity to grow in ways by achieving by any other matters. I agree\
  \ with Kumpulainen when she writes \u201CIn today\u2019s world, multicultural awareness,\
  \ language skills, and cultural knowledge as well as an appreciation of difference\
  \ are necessary competencies for any democratic and developing society\u201D. Without\
  \ this knowledge, we are Unable to learn from each other creating a society of indistinguishable\
  \ beliefs. In my opinion, broadening your mind can be one of the most personal beneficial\
  \ qualities you are capable of acquiring in life.\nWith the skill to understand\
  \ and see through the eyes of different cultures, we are able to interact with people\
  \ more reasonably and unselfishly. Humans are the frame work for our existence;\
  \ one will only get as far as they do in life with the support, assistance and interaction\
  \ with other humans. \nMy boyfriend and I spent last August in Norway our first\
  \ stop was Throlltunga 22 km of walking through snow, Matt rain wind and darkness\
  \ two days later we hiked will be to rock almost half the distance the second hike\
  \ seems like a breeze compared to the first one we spend the rest of the time relaxing\
  \ and exploring.\nOn one of our drives along the fjords we found ourselves alone\
  \  on the road surrounded by Endless beauty I felt like this was my chance to do\
  \ something else I\u2019ve always wanted to do..,"
