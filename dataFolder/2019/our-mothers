Text: "Walking into school that day was like any other day that summer. Sweat rolled\
  \ in beads down my back. I could taste it across my upper lip. Unpleasant urban\
  \ smells lingered in the air with the occasional glimpse of the sweet yet harsh\
  \ aroma of curries simmering in the basement. The sound of laughter and little bare\
  \ feet on the pavement felt welcoming to me. Just another day here.\n\nDropping\
  \ my things off in my classroom, I quickly realized the absence of children. I stuck\
  \ my head out the door and was summoned with a silent hand by a coworker. I followed\
  \ her down the three stairwells to the bottom floor. Everyone was standing around\
  \ an altar - students, teachers, and community members alike. A strange, yet comforting\
  \ silence filled the air. A soft breeze swirled and the sounds of everyday Bangkok\
  \ felt far away despite being surrounded by them.\n\nA coworker I\u2019d never spoken\
  \ with before approached me. She must have noticed my look of confusion. As everyone\
  \ sat down on the pavement in silence, she gestured me to follow her. We approached\
  \ a small altar on the side of the gathering place. Covering it were photos, artifacts,\
  \ and other items. Her fingers ran over each item gently and with care as if she\
  \ were drinking them in with her touch.\n\nOur eyes met - hers filled with tears.\
  \ \u201CMy Queen,\u201D she muttered softly. \u201CMy mother,\u201D she muttered\
  \ again, \u201Cher day.\u201D She never dropped her gaze. Though her words were\
  \ few and simple, I felt them to my core. In that moment I was unsure of why the\
  \ table was covered with photos and artifacts or why the many people of our school\
  \ seemed to be worshipping in the open-air, but it didn\u2019t matter. In that moment,\
  \ I felt connected.\n\nMy heart sank to a place of familiarity. My mother. In that\
  \ instant, I missed and loved her so. I felt a blanket of connection cloak over\
  \ myself and my coworker. I reached out my hand, palm open. Slowly, she reached\
  \ out hers as well. \u201CHer day,\u201D I repeated, squeezing her hand. She picked\
  \ up a few photos and handed them to me. I sifted through them carefully, observing\
  \ each with care. \u201CBeautiful,\u201D I said, locking eyes with her. \u201CBeautiful,\u201D\
  \ she repeated.\n\nWithout another word, we each returned to our spots next to our\
  \ respective classes. The rest of the day was filled with singing, dancing, worshipping,\
  \ and providing offerings for the Queen. It took little to no time to realize it\
  \ was her birthday. They were celebrating.\n\nAs I packed my things to leave that\
  \ day, I thought of my own mother. Each birthday with her felt more important than\
  \ the last with each passing year that she aged. I cherished each, trying my hardest\
  \ to make them special for her. I thought back to the moment I connected with my\
  \ coworker. Her feelings of cherishing the Queen\u2019s birthday mirrored mine of\
  \ my mother.\n\nI could have gone about that day feeling no connection to the celebrations,\
  \ to the customs, to the people. I could have rolled my eyes at dictatorship, a\
  \ way of life I\u2019d never known or understood.\n\nRather than judge, I made the\
  \ choice to immerse.\n\nI embraced each moment of the day. I celebrated, I sang,\
  \ I danced, I laughed, I learned, I worshipped, and I offered what little I had\
  \ as an unpaid international volunteer to a Queen whom was not my own.\n\nThat day,\
  \ I learned that we\u2019re not so different, despite our many differences.\n\n\
  That day,  I took off my hat as an American, as a foreigner, as an outsider, and\
  \ I followed the connection my heart felt to someone so different from myself.\n\
  \nThat day, I became a little more human."
