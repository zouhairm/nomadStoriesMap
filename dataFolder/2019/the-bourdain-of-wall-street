Text: "A year ago, I landed in Sri Lanka after a day long flight. Trying to fight\
  \ jet lag, I went to the hotel restaurant to stay awake with some peanuts and wine.\
  \ Exhausted, I was oblivious to the camera crew setting up around me...until...Anthony\
  \ Bourdain sat down at a table right in front of me! WAIT WHAT? Anthony Bourdain\
  \ is sitting 15 feet from me in SRI LANKA, in an empty restaurant, filming Parts\
  \ Unknown? The man who I respect for his undeniable passion for food and travel,\
  \ who has my dream job of international storytelling, who speaks his mind, who was\
  \ the motivation for me quitting my Wall Street job and risking it all for travel?\
  \  My inspiration was in front of me.  Right.  There.  I stared in disbelief, for\
  \ hours, watching him dine with a local woman, intensely listening to her story.\
  \  Calm, honest, and respectful yet edgy, direct and humorous. The film crew hid\
  \ in the bush behind my head to capture the best shots. When it wrapped up, I asked\
  \ them if it was appropriate to say hi. The response, \"as long as he's not eating,\
  \ he is open to it\". Even after living in Los Angeles and New York, he is the only\
  \ celebrity I\u2019ve approached to take a photo with. At this point, he had moved\
  \ to a couch and was sipping a cocktail with the producer.  After much hesitation,\
  \ the conversation started with \"Hi, sorry to interrupt...\".  He looked up, smiled\
  \ and immediately put me at ease.  He was probably just as tired as I was, but didn\u2019\
  t show it.  We chatted.  He was receptive to my weak attempt at trying to play it\
  \ cool.  I got to hear his signature laugh, as I told the story of me mimicking\
  \ his Istanbul street food episode, and how (let\u2019s be honest) some of the food\
  \ wasn\u2019t as great as he portrayed!  I, KERRY, made ANTHONY BOURDAIN LAUGH!!\
  \  When asked why I was in Sri Lanka, I gave him a 30 second recap of my recent\
  \ jump from Wall Street to pursue my passion of travel and creating a business.\
  \  He seemed to agree with my bold, out of character choice. Upon leaving, I asked\
  \ \u201CAny advice as I step into this unknown territory?\u201D, he said \u201C\
  be yourself\u201D.  I smiled and thanked him.  After a few steps, I spun back around\
  \ and inadvertently blurted out \u201C but what\u2019s YOUR secret?\u201D.  He quickly\
  \ replied without blinking \u201CI make things up as I go\u201D and smiled. That\
  \ moment is frozen in my memory and the reason I haven\u2019t gone back to Wall\
  \ Street."
