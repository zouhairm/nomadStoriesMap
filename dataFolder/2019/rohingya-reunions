Text: "\u201CTeacher!! I\u2019m in America!\u201D Chaos erupted the moment I picked\
  \ up my incoming Viber call. All I could see were five smiling faces crowded around\
  \ the small screen, simultaneously yelling. A slight moment of confusion was followed\
  \ by the realization that it was them. I couldn\u2019t believe it. Yasin\u2019s\
  \ family was here. Yasin, a nine-year-old Rohingya boy I met at a refugee shelter\
  \ in Thailand back in 2015.\n\u201CYasin?! You\u2019re in America?\u201D\n\u201C\
  Yes! Sheboygan, Wisconsin! Come visit me!\u201D\nI found a $38 roundtrip flight\
  \ from Denver to Milwaukee, hitchhiked to the small town of Sheboygan, and knocked\
  \ on their door.\nYasin answered. He was one of the first Rohingya children I met\
  \ in Thailand. When he saw me, his eyes lit up and he jumped into my arms. His sisters,\
  \ brothers, and mother joined and we were all finally reunited.\nI left this family\
  \ in Thailand thinking I would never see them again. The odds of Rohingya refugees\
  \ being relocated to the US are incredibly slim. \nI remember the day I met them\
  \ four years ago at a small shelter near my house. They had a mysterious past and\
  \ an unknown future. I wanted to learn their stories, so I visited them everyday\
  \ after work. In time, they opened up to me and shared their story.\nYasin is a\
  \ Rohingya Muslim, one of the most persecuted people in the world. He was born in\
  \ Myanmar, a predominantly Buddhist country. Most people are familiar with the Rohingya\
  \ genocide, something that is finally gaining a presence in the media. This genocide\
  \ has forced almost 1 million Rohingya refugees to flee Myanmar and find refuge\
  \ in neighboring Bangladesh. Yasin was lucky to flee his country before the violent\
  \ outbreak -- but the rest of his family was less fortunate.\nThe Rohingya people\
  \ are known to be the most persecuted people in the world. I consider them the most\
  \ scattered people in the world. Fighting for survival means doing just about anything\
  \ to live to see tomorrow -- and most times it means separating from friends and\
  \ family. \nYasin\u2019s family is no exception. Forced to flee the genocide, Yasin\
  \ was stranded on a boat for two months, left to die on a small island with no food\
  \ or water, and eventually taken to a prison in southern Thailand. \nYasin has a\
  \ father in Malaysia, an uncle in the Netherlands, cousins and grandparents in Bangladesh,\
  \ and uncle imprisoned in Thailand, and siblings in Wisconsin. I\u2019ve tracked\
  \ down almost all of them. More on this later.\nI found Yasin and 43 other Rohingya\
  \ people when they were fresh off the boat from Myanmar, finding refuge in Thailand.\
  \ I always regretted leaving them for America -- but I picked up that phone call\
  \ and everything changed.\nAfter finding them in Wisconsin, I realized they weren\u2019\
  t the only ones who were resettled in the States. The 43 other Rohingya women and\
  \ children were resettled throughout the States. \nThat\u2019s when I knew what\
  \ I had to do: commence Rohingya Reunions!\nI tracked down each Rohingya family\
  \ I knew when I lived in Thailand. Airports became my second home. Frontier Airlines\
  \ became my new Starbucks (gotta play the white girl card). Every other weekend,\
  \ I hopped on another airplane and showed up at their doorstep. \nI took it a step\
  \ further. I flew to Bangladesh to find their lost family members, starting with\
  \ Yasin\u2019s grandparents. In a camp of one million people, I was able to find\
  \ my friends\u2019 lost Rohingya family members and bring them photos of their loved\
  \ ones.\nI\u2019ve traveled to 19 cities (and counting!) to reunite with my Rohingya\
  \ friends and their lost family members. And they\u2019ve asked me to share their\
  \ stories so the world will know about the Rohingya people.\nSo here\u2019s a travel\
  \ blog with a slight twist. A way to honor those who have survived the genocide\
  \ and continue to show me the world. But I haven\u2019t found them all yet. It looks\
  \ like I\u2019m stuck searching for the rest of them, which means more Rohingya\
  \ home cooked chicken feet soup and opportunities to be the only white redheaded\
  \ girl in the area.\nWhere there be Rohingya, there be Sophie. Let the Rohingya\
  \ Reunions continue!"
