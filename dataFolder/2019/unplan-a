Text: "Nothing demolishes the building blocks of routine more aggressively than a\
  \ carefully unplanned holiday. \n\nFade in. Morning. 8 am-ish. \n\nI\u2019m at the\
  \ backseat of a taxi in Police Bazaar, Shillong, where the cool luxuriance of highland\
  \ air washes away the vitriol from my last dayjob. \nThe backing instructions by\
  \ \u2018The Ramones\u2019 feel like music to my ears. My personality is making a\
  \ comeback.\n\nPan to the rear-view mirror. \n\n\u2018Hey ho, let\u2019s go. We\u2019\
  ve been parked for 15 minutes now.\u2019. My driver communicates to me non-verbally.\
  \ \nHis need for a destination is on the verge of ending my reverie.\n\nDeflect\
  \ to kids by the wayside bubbling uniformly to a school of their parent\u2019s choice.\
  \ \n\nThrowback to Geography class in school, where I\u2019ve just discovered that\
  \ Cherrapunji is the rainiest place on Earth.\n\nSnap back to Google which tells\
  \ me I\u2019m just 53 kms from finding out what the world\u2019s wettest place feels\
  \ like. \n\n\u2018Cherrapunji chalo!\u2019 (Let\u2019s go to Cherrapunji!)\n\nJust\
  \ like that, my driver discovers purpose. He puts the car into gear with an assertion\
  \ that translates to the way he honks. Look out, Cherrapunji!\n\nPlug in headphones.\
  \ Cut to daydreaming.\n\nOk Google, what if it\u2019s not raining there? \n\nCloudy\
  \ with a chance of shower. \n\nMaybe, I should\u2019ve planned a little. \n\nAs\
  \ my driver\u2019s winsome Maruti-800 car zigs through the Khasi hills, I can see\
  \ the city being swiped left through my window. \nIn its place arrives a mise en\
  \ scene (even the words in my head are turning dramatic) starring a vast, curiously\
  \ dimpled grassland straight out of India Patagonia.   \n\nPink wildflowers come\
  \ streaming in too, followed by char-black monoliths, pencil-shaped tombstones and\
  \ brown-top Welsh cottages, \nset against spectacular desolation.\n\nAs I take off\
  \ my headphones, the bass effect of the passing breeze whistles into my ears. \n\
  This journey is transporting me to an arthouse film. Willingly, I suspend my disbelief.\
  \ \nI sense the child in me rise.\n\nCut to my driver (who is named Dhoni like the\
  \ famous Indian cricketer), who dutifully asks me where I\u2019m from.\n\nAs I say\
  \ Delhi, his face lights up with the longing for a place he\u2019d rather be. Suddenly,\
  \ there are two children in the car. \nIn fact, he now sets his language as sweet,\
  \ rundown English for the rest of the trip.\n\n\u2018Delhi aaah\u2026you see Qutub\
  \ Minar? It really so tall?!\u2019\n\nHe\u2019s trying to show me his version of\
  \ \u2018tall\u2019, but his ambition is limited by the low roof of his Maruti 800.\n\
  \n\u2018Yes, yes it\u2019s very tall. You must come to Delhi sometime.\u2019\n\n\
  \u2018My dream trip Sir, saving money for it!\u2019\n\nAnd to think, I\u2019ve been\
  \ to Qutub Minar only once in my seven years of working in Delhi. \n\nAfter another\
  \ half-hour of roadspeak, we\u2019re in Cherrapunji, where we pull over at a tuck\
  \ shop for some highway tea. \n\nDhoni lights up his beedi (a type of Indian cigarette)\
  \ and asks me expectantly, \u2018Ok, we in Cherrapunji, where you go now?\u2019\n\
  \nI sip my tea and try not to exchange an empty look.\n\nHe fills the radio silence\
  \ with a crackle of excitement: \u2018Come, I take you to waterfall\u2026\u2019\n\
  \nMust be one of those basic, roadside cascades. Boring. \nI agree anyway, for want\
  \ of a less boring idea.\n\nAs we motor away to the \u2018waterfall\u2019, the landscape\
  \ seamlessly morphs into steep craggy cliffs, \nluscious green forests and little\
  \ mystic rivers. A cracking Monsoon thunder electrifies the atmosphere with impending\
  \ wonder.\n\nOnly one thing can happen from here.\n\nIn a few minutes, it does.\
  \ I find myself at Noh Kalikai, the highest plunge waterfall in India.\n\nThe total\
  \ lack of ceremony makes this experience feel like a happy serendipity. \nAs I take\
  \ in the bird\u2019s eye view, my toes raise as the ground beneath me slips. \n\
  The child in me sighs \u2018WOAAHHH!\u2019. \nThis is India\u2019s own Angel Falls.\
  \ There\u2019s also a dreamy blue lagoon at the waterhole. \nNo fabled Monsoon downpour\
  \ though, despite the overbearing clouds. \nBut, look, someone has left a tap running\
  \ for me nearby, with no bucket in sight!\n\nPan to Dhoni to catch his expression.\
  \ He seems more excited by his next question, \u2018Sir, how much flight ticket\
  \ to Delhi?\u2019\n\nPerfect. Just the way I planned. \n\nFade out"
