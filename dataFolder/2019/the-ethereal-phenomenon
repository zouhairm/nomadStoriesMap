Text: "\"Ladies and Gentlemen I've turned the cabin lights off... if you look to your\
  \ left you will see the Aurora Borealis dancing alongside the aircraft\".\n\nTo\
  \ kick-start our epic month long adventure around Northern Europe (surprisingly\
  \ undiscovered and not so 'cool' to travel around), Norway had to be the starting\
  \ point. Having booked a 4 day trip to chase the Northern Lights in a Campervan,\
  \ hearing those words as we flew from Oslo to Tromso was a shock. \nLanding in Norway,\
  \ a completely unknown land, and deciding to drive a van (on the other side of the\
  \ road, in deep snow) was not a decision we made lightly. \n\nI'd researched extensively\
  \ day and night to find the best tips for finding the Northern Lights - knowing\
  \ how elusive and transient they are. Every website, every blog, even Instagram\
  \ showed me day after day beautiful photographs of the Aurora but were always followed\
  \ by warnings!\n\nWe visited Tromso in February - by far the best time of year to\
  \ visit. There will be little to no snowfall and the Northern Lights forecasts are\
  \ proven to be more accurate at this time. A naturally occurring phenomenon, the\
  \ chances of seeing the Aurora are based on many factors - Solar activity, Solar\
  \ wind, clear skies, being in the right area at the right time.\n\nThe Campervan\
  \ was perfect, in Tromso the Northern Lights season is peak tourism and therefore\
  \ costly. We found some Aurora trips costing \xA3500 each. The Camper cost us \xA3\
  100 per night and with no additional accommodation costs or trip costs we definitely\
  \ saved money.\nWe were also able to actively explore and drive around this stunning\
  \ place together. We drove to remote locations way away from the lights of Tromso\
  \ City, cooked dinner and waited for the lights.\n\nNorway is famous for it's 'Freedom\
  \ to Roam' policy - one I wish every country had. You can pull up anywhere, camp\
  \ anywhere (as long as you're 150m from the nearest dwelling). This gave us an incredible\
  \ sense of freedom never experienced before. \n\nAround Tromso there are a number\
  \ of islands you can easily access - Kval\xF8ya, Senja, Sommar\xF8y, H\xE5k\xF8\
  ya... The roads are cleared twice daily by snowploughs and the side of the roads\
  \ are also swept so you can easily pull up and have lunch or hike over snowy hilltops.\
  \ \nWe were warned of the wind - this was a major factor in us staying close to\
  \ Tromso as the weather can change so dramatically you can't drive too far on main\
  \ roads along the coast. However, as we soon discovered, the Troms municipality\
  \ had so much more to offer than I could ever have imagined. \n\nI would highly\
  \ recommend Eide Handel supermarket - an incredible 'Deli on Steroids' in Kval\xF8\
  ysletta. Much better than the standard supermarkets you find in other European countries\
  \ - this market had all the Norwegian delicacies you could imagine! I was amazed\
  \ at the fish - huge mounds of Lutefisk, lobsters, cod and more... We couldn't get\
  \ enough of the Norsk Kanelboller, delicious swirls of dough and cinnamon topped\
  \ with cinnamon sugar. (We ate more of these here than pastries in Denmark!).\n\n\
  Of all the places we visited, I'd go back in an instant - I feel any time of year\
  \ this place will be beautiful, mind-blowing, dramatic and every-changing. The change\
  \ in weather from hour to hour meant you can sit in the same place and watch it\
  \ change in front of your eyes.\n\n4 nights in a row we saw the lights, we could\
  \ not believe our luck - and that's exactly what it is. A week earlier, our Campervan\
  \ host, Freddie told us was dry - no lights whatsoever and a lot of snow and cloud.\
  \ The first two nights were quite weak and not as dramatic as you'd expect but the\
  \ last night blew us both away - we stood still for hours staring at the sky not\
  \ caring that our hands were freezing or legs going numb from the cold wind. The\
  \ warmth of the colours seeps into you and the adrenaline from the excitement of\
  \ the rapid, flowing, beautiful movements stops you from caring about the weather.\n\
  \nBelieve me, it's worth it - take that step into the unknown. Heck, leap for it!"
