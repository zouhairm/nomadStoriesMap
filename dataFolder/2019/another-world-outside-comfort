Text: "A journey where else is new for me. \nI take a leap of going to the place far\
  \ away from my comfort zone, To Amsterdam! \nIt is an opportunity, to start my Europe\
  \ Travel for 2018 in this amazing city, where I supposedly heading to Germany to\
  \ attend my bestfriend's wedding, yeah quite like in a movie theme.\nIt was last\
  \ August 27, 2018 when I did my first solo travel, since I am on a budget and a\
  \ kinda cheap-chic, Luckily booked my ticket for a 50% off because my friend is\
  \ working in one of prestige airline, and booked a hostel, with 4 bed capacity.\n\
  Jumping on my travel story, I prepare a lot of printed maps, itineraries, downloaded\
  \ offline maps, and a translator app as my travel kits.\nArrived 9pm in Amsterdam\
  \ Airport, I wore my biggest smile and outmost courage, to ask and know where am\
  \ I going to find my hostel, rode on their train, just by asking some locals, in\
  \ which way I am heading, recording myself to make a vlog. \n I then reached the\
  \ Amsterdam Central at 11:30pm, It wasn't quite far, but things are never easy for\
  \ me so I kept on assuring which way I am going, Going outside the central, my maps\
  \ turns uneasy, so to be sure of, I asked the police officers where is my hostel.\
  \ Managed to reach the hostel and it shocked me to find out that it was a loud bar\
  \ full of people looking at me, (As I thought it is) and partying\U0001F631 Yes!\
  \ That time I'm thinking, Am I really staying in this place? \nAnd this where my\
  \ journey begins, the receptionist gave me the door key, went upstairs and opened\
  \ the door, wishing it was a girl whose sleeping in that one side of the bed, and\
  \ she is! wooh! I should prepare my things and out of fortune, I forgot my luggage\
  \ key in Dubai, at home \U0001F926\U0001F3FB\u200D\u2640\uFE0F \nI must think about\
  \ the solution, quite learned from being a girl scout, I opened it with my hair\
  \ pin! \U0001F4AA\U0001F3FB Can't sleep yet and at 2am, 2 men came across my bed\
  \ and 1 down my bed, they were my roomates then. Ooh I should be well aware I chose\
  \ to stay in a hostel, where mixed people are. \nFast forward, I woke up and the\
  \ 4 of us in the room greeted \"Goodmorning\".\nI prepare myself to a day of adventure\
  \ for my self, prepared my camera, and started to roam around the city, and follow\
  \ my itineraries for that day, while wandering the streets of Amsterdam, I felt\
  \ I was in a dream, I travelled several places already, but this one is different,\
  \ It was kinda living a \"madeleine\" atmosphere and seeing like picturesque buildings,\
  \ Im starting to feel the vibe, I'm one grateful loner traveller.\U0001F917\n I\
  \ enjoyed the sight- seeing, asking questions to locals,like, my where-abouts  and\
  \ seeking adventures in this little city.\nI had fun walking around since all those\
  \ in my maps are just steps away from each other, Went to Dam Square, take a sumptouos\
  \ lunch, rode their tram, did the famous Heineken Experience,walked in the Red Light\
  \ District and my most unforgettable experience is to rode a bus going to Zaanse\
  \ Schans Windmills, Am really in Holland, I sigh. I managed to take a good photos,\
  \ because I strategized, seeing some of the solo traveller or a couple, which I\
  \ offered help to take a picture of them, and telling if they can take me a picture\
  \ too. \U0001F605\nIt was a surreal experience! I got to do a lot of things all\
  \ in one day! and mind you, I didn't spent a lot. Then went back to the hostel,\
  \ stayed for few hours to charge my phone, drink a little, met and chat someone\
  \ I just knew a solo traveller too from Sweden. \nTravellled again to the bus station\
  \ going to Germany at 11pm.\nI really promised myself to go back in Amsterdam, since\
  \ I really really had fun and hopefully bring someone with me to eplore and experience\
  \ it too.\nAdventure never ends.\nBye for now.\nThank you!"
