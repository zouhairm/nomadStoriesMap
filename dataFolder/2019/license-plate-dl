Text: "It was either raining or threatening to rain -- that was the usual scenario,\
  \ of course. I'd taken the necessary midday break from writing. Most days I walked\
  \ on one of the peat-cutting roads which made it so easy to get lost, but today\
  \ I was trying to see how far I could get by the main road, along the broad green\
  \ verge that ran alongside. From Falcarragh to the house, the walls and hedgerows\
  \ made following the road an unpleasant and dangerous prospect, but from the house\
  \ into the countryside, it grew roomier. \n\nA car slowed down as it passed me;\
  \ the passenger, a woman perhaps in her sixties, leaned out to ask me where I was\
  \ headed. I answered honestly that I didn't know. \n\n\"Would you like a lift?\"\
  \ \n\nNot knowing where I was bound, the only possible answer was yes. I hopped\
  \ in with Seamus and Mary -- as they turned out to be called -- and asked where\
  \ they were headed, learning that it was Glenveagh National Park. A stroke of good\
  \ fortune. This was a famous and storied place, full of long walks in the mountains,\
  \ a castle, some deer that seemed to run nearly wild. \n\nThe drive was accompanied\
  \ by a bit of history: the Bridge of Tears, they explained, was where many families\
  \ parted ways as one member left for America. Glenveagh itself was where they passed\
  \ many summer afternoons, walking the trails and enjoying the sun (which had, by\
  \ now, come out from the clouds). It also featured safety advice for the eager traveller,\
  \ which boiled down to making sure I got into cars from Donegal. \n\n\"Donegal drivers\
  \ you can trust,\" they told me proudly. (I had to assume this did not extend to\
  \ road safety, as although they themselves were sensible drivers, the walk to and\
  \ from town had taught me caution.) The letters DL on the license plate identified\
  \ the county, and since most people in the nearby area knew each other, there was\
  \ a mutual sense of security, of being amongst friends. They didn't seem to mind\
  \ that I was a stranger myself, but invited me to share in this rule, to abide by\
  \ it should I continue to hitchhike during my stay. \n\nAt the park they showed\
  \ me the museum (a quick primer on local wildlife), the castle itself (a fine front\
  \ room with a fireplace), and the grounds, which were setting up for a festival.\
  \ Musicians practiced in the courtyard, while the usual array of weekend tourists\
  \ milled about the lakeside, the gardens, or the trails. We briefly parted ways,\
  \ Seamus and Mary taking their weekend walk while I ran down to the shore -- Lough\
  \ Beagh was half-shimmering, half-stormy, and ringed by mountains. I'd brought my\
  \ sketchbook for a reason. \n\nWe met back at the tearoom, and compared notes, before\
  \ heading to the movie that introduced the history of the region. Underneath the\
  \ peace and sense of protection offered by the national park, a grim and often screamingly\
  \ unjust story of landlords, tenant farmers, and missing sheep unfolded in Glenveagh,\
  \ which somehow, through an act of beautiful reversal, still ended up as the area\
  \ of natural beauty and public pleasure that we saw for ourselves. The sense of\
  \ trust and local connection, which Seamus and Mary had described as being a feature\
  \ of Donegal today, had been born of concerted effort, I guessed. \n\nThere's a\
  \ peaceful valley on the way back from Glenveagh, where we stopped very briefly\
  \ to take a look. It's called the Poisoned Glen. A reference to the Famine, when\
  \ the inhabitants died as a result of eating grass, trying to stave off starvation.\
  \ \n\n\"Queen Victoria gave five pounds towards famine relief,\" Mary told me as\
  \ we gazed down at the roofless church and the cluster of houses. \"And another\
  \ five to the dogs' home.\" I wondered if the dogs' home was an oddly-named charity,\
  \ but no -- a sign of the queen's priorities. Once again I thought of that trust,\
  \ and the underlying implication that here, people look out for each other. They\
  \ may tell you to watch out for strangers, but when it comes to it, they'll look\
  \ after them, too."
