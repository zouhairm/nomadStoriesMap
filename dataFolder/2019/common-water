Text: "The sailboat skimmed across the surface of the tranquil sea that was home to\
  \ the Whitsunday islands. It was late afternoon and the sun was preparing for its\
  \ descent into the horizon. After a long day of snorkeling amongst colorful reef\
  \ and exotic fish, I settled down on the edge of the deck to watch the islands go\
  \ by. My body ached in the most satisfying way and my mind was content with simply\
  \ existing in such an beauteous place. \n\nI was soon joined by an Israeli guy about\
  \ my age. Small talk revealed that he was traveling after four years of service\
  \ in the military. I felt a bit of hesitation. Although not religious myself, I\
  \ come from a Muslim background and have relatives who are staunchly and vocally\
  \ against the persecution of the Palestinians by the Israeli militia. I had heard\
  \ tales of people forcefully removed from their homes and killed for resisting,\
  \ all in the name of a birthright. But I also knew that there are two sides to every\
  \ story, and wanted to understand his. In spite of this, my briefly open mind snapped\
  \ closed when he suggested Obama was a Muslim. \u201CYou didn\u2019t know that?\u201D\
  \ he asked incredulously. \n\n\u201CYou\u2019re serious?\u201D I replied. \u201C\
  Everyone knows that was propaganda meant to invoke fear and mistrust.\u201D He continued\
  \ to insist it was true. 'Oh boy,' I thought. 'It\u2019s gonna be impossible to\
  \ have a reasonable conversation with someone so brainwashed. Eager to change the\
  \ subject, I asked about the friend he was traveling with.' \u201CSo you were both\
  \ in the military?\u201D \n\n\u201CAll Israelis join the military after school,\u201D\
  \ he said. \u201CEven the girls. It is mandatory.\u201D Surprised, I let this sink\
  \ in for a moment as I wondered what my life would be like had I been required to\
  \ join the army. The Draft was known to American children only from history books;\
  \ it seemed a discarded vestige of the past and had never applied to women. Intrigued,\
  \ I began to ask him questions of his experiences in the army, the political situation,\
  \ and whether he would have joined by choice. With each intriguing answer I grew\
  \ more curious. He made me humbly realize my own ignorance on certain matters and\
  \ appreciate freedoms I had always taken for granted. In turn, he was fascinated\
  \ by me and how I had come to be so far from home all on my own and on the road\
  \ for so long. \n\nOur sentiments fed and grew off each other as so happens in good\
  \ conversation, and the further we delved the more we discovered we had in common.\
  \ I felt ashamed that I had almost written him off based on initial judgment. After\
  \ all, isn\u2019t this the true aspiration of travel, what makes one grow as a person?\
  \ It\u2019s not solely about seeing the sights and taking photographs, but about\
  \ befriending people I would have never encountered back home, learning a perspective\
  \ I might have never seen.\n\n\u201CAs for the conflicts in Israel,\u201D he started,\
  \ bringing the conversation full circle, \u201CI see and understand the hurt and\
  \ anger from both sides. I fear that there will never be peace in Israel, not until\
  \ one side is willing to let go of the past. And that is a big thing to ask.\u201D\
  \n\nJust then we turned a corner around an island and were hit with a dazzling view\
  \ of the sunset reflecting upon the open sea. The clouds were glowing golden with\
  \ a curious warmth as beams of light broke through them and shot down to the water\
  \ like majestic pillars of light. \n\nHe let out a slow whistle. \u201CBeautiful,\
  \ isn\u2019t it?\u201D he said. The breathtaking pink-orange sky and awe-inducing\
  \ golden sea that surrounded us were spectacular indeed, but the beauty I would\
  \ remember the most in the years to come was that of the moment of respect and genuine\
  \ appreciation of the other that passed between us. I still wonder today if it was\
  \ wishful thinking or plausible optimism to hope one day Israelis and Palestinians\
  \ could experience the same."
