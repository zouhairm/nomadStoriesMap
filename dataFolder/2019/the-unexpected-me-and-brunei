Text: "What do you know about Brunei?? When they knew I was going to stop over in\
  \ Brunei for one night most responded were \u201Cohh, Are there anything interesting\
  \ there?\u201D \u201CReally? Seems like not much to do\u201D \u201CAre you going\
  \ alone?\u201D \u201CBe careful they\u2019re Muslim country\u201D \nOk. I know that\
  \ might be the reaction I will get once I told my close friends and family, but\
  \ it doesn\u2019t stop me from stop over for a night. \nCome on! I grew up in Bangkok!\
  \ Hello!!!! I should be able to survive in many other circumstances if I got through\
  \ the sleepless capital city of Thailand. You can also count that I have moved to\
  \ live in Melbourne, Australia for over 10 years back. \nSo I think I am 100% capable\
  \ of going on Solo travel for just a night.\n\nThe fact that a lot of people still\
  \ don\u2019t know much about Brunei except there are quite rich country and they\
  \ have a lot of petroleum and Orangutang.  \n\nI have read about this small country\
  \ for a research and found out that the crime rate is really low and seems to be\
  \ peaceful place as they have population less then a million people. I was so confident\
  \ that I will be fine whather I will have a good time or not.\nAnd I was right.\
  \ I really had a good time there and I plan to go there again with proper time to\
  \ traveling around.\n\nThe people overthere were so friendly and respectful even\
  \ you are a non Muslim Asian looking lady with pink hair and with a tattoo on the\
  \ arm and traveling alone. The weather was quite humid but fresh and clean. Ahh\
  \ yes, the street was really cleaned! I couldn\u2019t see a rubbish on the street\
  \ like many Asian country are having a problem with waste management. Two thumbs\
  \ up! \n\nThe funny story about this one night stand was I have never done any stop\
  \ over before so I had no idea that the air line would not allowed us to take a\
  \ loaded baggage out of the air port only the carry on baggage will be allow. \n\
  \nWhat happened was, I packed most of the personal stuffs in the suitcase which\
  \ loaded with a lipgloss, books, labtop, a jacket,a T-shirt and 3box of chocolates.\
  \ \n\nThe flight was delayed for 4 hours and I had to queued up for on arrival visa\
  \ so by the time I got out of the airport was almost 3am in the morning. Everything\
  \ was closed.\nOnce arrived at the hotel I first checked in and search what do I\
  \ get in my room, anything useful such as soap or toothbrush would be great and\
  \ yes I found them all! I first took off my underwear and wased them with soap as\
  \ I have been wearing them for 20 hours already and I\u2019ll have a full day waiting\
  \ for me tomorrow.\nI hang them near the air con and hope it would dry in the morning.\n\
  My original plan was to wake up really early morning to go with the free hotel water\
  \ boat tour to see the Sunrise near on the river and walk around the local market\
  \ etc nope! I woke up at 9.30am quickly showered used the dryer to dry off the undy\
  \ and bra then rush for free breakfast. By the time I finished breakfast was 10.30\
  \ already. \nOk new plan, I must see the Mosque and the river today before I leave\
  \ in the evening.\n \nI download the local app called Dart to booked the car which\
  \ is quite similar to Uber but you can pay cash. It was cool! \n\nI first went to\
  \ the beautiful Omar Ali Saifuddien Mosque (which I didn\u2019t know that none Muslim\
  \ can\u2019t enter on Wednesday, ok fine next time than) the followed by a refreshing\
  \ and relaxing Kampung scenic boat tour. I loved it! Suddenly my worried about no\
  \ deodorant, no cream, no make up on, wearing an old clothe and I only got  20 Brunei\
  \ dollars in my jeans (yes I forgot a wallet)\nIt was just a smile on my face, calmness\
  \ mood and the blue sky that matters."
