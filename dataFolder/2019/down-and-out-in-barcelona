Text: "Sweating and disheveled, I stood in the metro plaza with the awkward turquoise-blue\
  \ suitcase I\u2019d carried through the mazes of narrow Catalonian streets, and\
  \ gracelessly dragged up the station stairway. Here I waited anxiously for the locally-born\
  \ Moroccan girl I had arranged to meet last-minute, for the first time, before I\
  \ were to stay with her and her family in their small apartment in L\u2019Hospitalet,\
  \ in the outskirts of Barcelona. \nThis was due to a seemingly unfortunate twist\
  \ of fate ; I had lost my \u2018job\u2019 as a volunteer at a local hostel without\
  \ notice, about 5,000 miles away from home without a return ticket, or the means\
  \ to buy one.\n\nBeing 19, and from a relatively good upbringing, I wasn\u2019t\
  \ prone to homelessness - and this sudden predicament I had found myself in shouldn't\
  \ be compared to the misfortunes of those who are - but for the time being, mostly\
  \ due to my own lack of planning, I truly had no money and no place to stay.  A\
  \ debacle I tried not to dwell on. In fact, I hadn\u2019t had the luxury to think\
  \ of anything except where it was I would be sleeping for the next few nights ;\
  \ and whether I could get my giant blue suitcase there.  \n For me to rely completely\
  \ on the generosity of a stranger was unusual, and unadvised ; \u201Cdon't try this\
  \ at home\u201D or abroad. But the minute I saw the girl, Wal\xE2, approach the\
  \ metro stop, I knew I had made a safe bet, she had an approachable smile, and a\
  \ laid-back demeanour that made me feel like our rendezvous wasn\u2019t as strange\
  \ as it had seemed.  \n\n Having arrived at her family\u2019s apartment, her parents\
  \ greeted me as if I were a long-lost relative they were welcoming home. Their house\
  \ was modest yet cosy, every wall decorated with Arab writing and art and an L-shaped\
  \ sofa lined the living room covered in an extensive selection of square, multicoloured\
  \ cushions. Neither of them spoke English, though they spoke four languages in total,\
  \ and my Spanish was very basic.. but I discovered that words can be unnecessary,\
  \ counterproductive even, when learning the language of another\u2019s culture.\
  \ \n\nMy first lesson was on how to prepare traditional mint tea, and I was an eager\
  \ student. I watched as the father methodically poured the tea back-and-forth between\
  \ the glass and the teapot, making a gentle rhythmic sound. This was a lesson in\
  \ patience, too, as it was only after the seventh changeover that I was finally\
  \ allowed to take a sip - it was worth the wait, however. The tea-tray was constantly\
  \ replenished, and lay on the ovular mahogany table around which we\u2019d later\
  \ eat dinner. \n\nThat evening, and most evenings afterward, we were served an authentic\
  \ couscous dish in a huge ceramic plate ; one plate between the four of us, that\
  \ we\u2019d then divide with our spoons into equal segments. It was the best thing\
  \ I\u2019d eaten in weeks (not because of my newfound vagabond lifestyle) but because\
  \ it was homemade, hearty and cooked with deliberate care. After I had eaten my\
  \ fair share, I let my spoon rest on the now empty quarter of the plate. This move\
  \ was immediately counteracted by Wal\xE2's mother, who insistently spooned more\
  \ couscous and sauce over to my side. I graciously ate it, and our exchange continued..\
  \ until there was no food left to serve.\n\nLater that night I lay under an other-people\u2019\
  s-house smelling blanket, while being watched by an intimidatingly large ginger\
  \ cat who would claw at me whenever I mistakenly moved to his side of the bed. Another\
  \ quirk of \u2018living on the edge\u2019, I thought. The Spanish blinds forbade\
  \ any light to shine in, making the room unnaturally dark. I thought about home,\
  \ my own family, my circumstances, and the unusual day I\u2019d had. I thought for\
  \ a while, and then remembered how tired I was. And that I was still here, in Barcelona\
  \ ; the place I had always wanted to be in.. and closed my heavy, grateful eyelids.\
  \ The clock ticked in the hallway. The neighbours shouted indistinctly. The cat\
  \ purred loudly. And my dreams were as sweet as Moroccan gunpowder green tea."
