Text: "When I chose to travel to China, I intended to rekindle memories of my grandmother\u2019\
  s cooking. I envisioned slurping glass noodles soaked in green onions and soy sauce\
  \ and ruminating over memories of her chewing on fat blossom mushrooms. The steam\
  \ from the rice would waft through my lungs and let me take a deep breath of her\
  \ perfume again. \nThe moment I stepped off from the plane in Beijing, I found that\
  \ my nostrils were confronted with the heavy metals in the air. As a group of sixty\
  \ in our study abroad program, we found ourselves beginning our journey from Beijing\u2019\
  s airport to be bused around from one touristic spot to the next. Days were full\
  \ of site-seeing: pearl, jade, and textile factories one after the next. In the\
  \ evenings, however, I went on my own excursions to restaurants in hope to remind\
  \ myself why I had visited in the first place. \nAt my first meal, my roast duck\
  \ had arrived. I stared longingly from across the dining room, my mind full of memories\
  \ of home. I brought the duck to my mouth with a bit of rice and realized it wasn\u2019\
  t the same. This isn\u2019t my grandmother\u2019s cooking. My mind flooded back\
  \ to her hands chopping, her lips tasting and her eyes urging me to take another\
  \ bite. As I took a few more bites, I began to notice the differences in preparation\
  \ and flavors. While I grew up eating my own Cantonese grandmother\u2019s cooking,\
  \ I did not realize the wealth of differences between my conceptions of Chinese\
  \ cooking and the differences between regional cuisines. \nAs I drew my attention\
  \ to the facade I built up of what Chinese food looks like - I realized it was limiting\
  \ my abilities to see what is in front of me. When I disrupted my preconceptions,\
  \ I began to enjoy the vastness of differences in the food. By letting go of ideas\
  \ of what it should taste like and what it should be like, I opened my eyes to the\
  \ unseen possibilities of being a new place. By expecting to find something, I would\
  \ miss out on the ability to focus on the present. \nAs the trip was coming to an\
  \ end, our Professor suggested we visit a monastery in Nanjing. When we entered\
  \ the monastery we were given a handful of yellow incense. Walking through we found\
  \ monks kneeling at the bases of several different statues bowing. Holding onto\
  \ the incense, we exited the inner building and out to a courtyard with a view of\
  \ Nanjing\u2019s city center. There, individuals stood with their incense sticks\u2019\
  \ smoke dancing within the air. To our right was a bright orange fire, where we\
  \ all lit our sticks. My incense began a sultry dance upwards. \nI noticed standing\
  \ next to me was a grandfather urging me to bow with him. He was about a foot shorter\
  \ than me, but his smile stretched across his face. \nOne, two, and three he motioned\
  \ as held the incense between his hands. Mirroring him, he smiled and my memories\
  \ floated back to my grandmothers funeral, the same incense burning throughout the\
  \ night. I had forgotten about the fiery smell and the warmth of the room as we\
  \ all sat around her mourning the loss of the family\u2019s matriarch. \nOne, two,\
  \ three, I bowed again, tears trickling down my face as the incense began to transport\
  \ me back to the sounds of family members murmuring in remembrance of her. \nOne,\
  \ two three, I bowed for a final time only to realize the man smiling and nodding\
  \ as if he too found grief within the smoke. \nOn my return journey home, I found\
  \ my experience in China forced me to focus on the present in front of me rather\
  \ than being blinded by my past preconceptions. By learning to deconstruct my thinking,\
  \ I was able to notice the common linkages between us, noticing the small things\
  \ that may differentiate us but also bring us together."
