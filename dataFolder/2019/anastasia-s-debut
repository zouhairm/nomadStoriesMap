Text: "Anastasia\u2019s Debut\nBy Debra L. Gish\n\nAnastasia grabbed the microphone\
  \ away from the speaker, Director of Curative Medicine in Papua New Guinea (PNG),\
  \ who had just declared his nation\u2019s health priority: HIV/AIDS.\n\n\u201CWhat?\u201D\
  \ she screamed into the mic, eyes bulging with puzzled fury, \u201Care you aware\
  \ of the main cause of HIV/AIDS in PNG?\u201D\nNo answer.\n\n\u201CAre you aware\
  \ of what\u2019s causing the outlandish high rate of infant mortality among pregnant\
  \ women in PNG?\u201D\nNo answer.\n\n\u201CAre you aware of the main cause for surgical\
  \ emergencies among the women admitted to ER at this hospital?\u201D she paused.\n\
  No answer.\n\n\u201CAnd, are you aware of the number one cause of death among women\
  \ in PNG?\u201D \nNo answer.\n\nAnastasia broke the silence: \u201CThe answer to\
  \ ALL my questions is Gender-Based Violence!\n\nRegistered Nurse Anastasia attended\
  \ desperate women in the ER, victims (survivors, actually) of sexual assault, rape,\
  \ torture, brutal amputation, and other forms of extreme violence against them,\
  \ all because they are women. Because 97% were victims of domestic violence, Anastasia\
  \ founded the Family Support Centre (FSC) at Angau Memorial Hospital in Lae, Papua\
  \ New Guinea to provide care to survivors through a humanitarian process of medical\
  \ treatment and emotional healing, including accompanying survivors through the\
  \ legal process if they press charges. Most do not.\n\n\nHours later, traveling\
  \ down a pot-holed road from Lae, perched behind a barbed wire fence in a mango\
  \ grove, I entered the City Mission Safe House for adolescents. I met nine teenage\
  \ girls, ages 13-17 years.\n \nFiona was 15, admitted after suffering continual\
  \ rape by her father. She sheepishly approached, wanting to tell me about her situation.\
  \ Tears filled my eyes, remembering mine.\n\n\u201CPlease, sit down,\u201D I pointed\
  \ to a chair beside me.\n\n \u201CI want you to know,\u201D she started, \u201C\
  that we\u2019re safe here. We feel safe here. They\u2019re good to us and treat\
  \ us well. We make friends with other girls, but we\u2019re still young, and I worry\
  \ about school.\u201D\n\n\u201CI want to study,\u201D Fiona continued, \u201Cbut\
  \ we\u2019re stuck here, not allowed to go to school because they are afraid something\
  \ may happen to us on the road to school. I graduated from 5th grade and I\u2019\
  m supposed to be in 6th grade this year, but school already started and I\u2019\
  m getting behind in my studies. Can you help us?\u201D\n\nFiona\u2019s appeal was\
  \ heartfelt, gentle and powerful, given my fragile mood. But I must be careful not\
  \ to create false hopes that will not be honored after I leave. You see, I\u2019\
  m the UN\u2019s lead international advisor on setting up the National Secretariat\
  \ on Gender-Based Violence (GBV) for the government of Papua New Guinea. My work\
  \ involves traveling around the country, conducting consultations with government\
  \ and civil society organizations, searching for practical ways to prevent and respond\
  \ to the horrific violence blocking this nation\u2019s development. \n\nAnastasia\u2019\
  s outburst and Fiona\u2019s plea for continuing education are just two true episodes\
  \ of female survivors plagued by gender-based violence, struggling to be heard.\
  \ I\u2019m often at a loss to respond --although I want to, I can\u2019t. I always\
  \ seem to come up short.\n\nMany people and organizations are working on GBV here\
  \ in some capacity, like counseling or nursing. But there is virtually no coordination\
  \ among the service providers. Most work in dark isolation. My job is bringing key\
  \ stakeholders together to work collaboratively, within a framework of national\
  \ coordination, to implement the national strategy: End Gender-Based Violence by\
  \ 2025. With two out of three women currently suffering from gender-based violence\
  \ here, it\u2019s very ambitious.\n\nI\u2019m a relatively fearless world traveler,\
  \ always seeking new experiences while navigating in and out of once beautiful war\
  \ zones, undetected, for over 20 years now. Admittedly, I\u2019m not a typical tourist\
  \ to PNG. After four months here, the allure of mystical highlands and sultry coasts\
  \ that are advertised in this ancient country\u2019s boastful brochures still eludes\
  \ me.\n\nIsland hopping, I catch glimpses from the seaplane, sighing back at the\
  \ clouds floating on volcanos and gentle waves kissing the sand. Yet I\u2019m not\
  \ able to fully appreciate the natural beauty -- no, not until every woman and child\
  \ can live a life free of fear, feeling safe in their own exotic, yet troubled homeland."
