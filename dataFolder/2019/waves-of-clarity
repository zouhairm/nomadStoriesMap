Text: "Hailing from Cape Town, but living in Durban, I had no idea that a phone-call\
  \ had the capacity to change my life! \n\nI realized with profound excitement and\
  \ a major dose of trepidation, that I accepted an invitation to join some family\
  \ on vacation to the luscious Seychelles islands.  \n\nThe company was amazing!\
  \ My uncle\u2019s cork-dry humor is hilarious, while my aunt wasn\u2019t micromanaging,\
  \ allowing us to immerse ourselves in the colorful experience of being there. We\
  \ share a particular brand of humor, so the entire trip was filled with laughter!\
  \ \n\nI envisioned days on end, with my feet in the sand and my hands on a keyboard,\
  \ catching up on work! Instead, our itinerary was filled to the brim with activities\
  \ that included helicopter rides and myriad tours, exploring the various islands\
  \ that form the Seychelles. Whilst island-hopping on Christmas day, we were relaxing\
  \ at the beach, when my aunt, who was in the water, suddenly started waving excitedly\
  \ at us, creating eruptions of laughter while we waved our arms crazily in response\
  \ to her fervor! She was uncharacteristically far from the shore, but with the water\
  \ having been calm, we weren\u2019t worried. \n\nAfter she panted her way back to\
  \ us, she exasperatedly exclaimed that she was calling for help! She insisted that\
  \ she could feel the water pulling her, while we just sat there laughing, trying\
  \ to understand why she was so upset! \n\nThe next morning was a frenzied rush as\
  \ we packed for our return home, utterly frustrated that my uncle was insisting\
  \ that we get ready and leave early because he didn\u2019t want to risk missing\
  \ our flight. We packed. Made a silent promise to the pristine waters to be back\
  \ once more. And had our last drink at the hotel juice-bar, before we left for the\
  \ airport \u2013 possibly 4 hours early!\n \nAs we left our hotel and got onto the\
  \ island\u2019s only actual road, we saw buses overturned, trees completely uprooted,\
  \ buildings demolished and disarray in every direction! We were talking simultaneously,\
  \ trying to make sense of what we were seeing, knowing that just a few hours before,\
  \ everything was idyllic. Then we sat in absolute silence trying to fathom what\
  \ we were now a part of, each of us knowing that this moment would stay with us\
  \ forever. \nIt was only at the airport, that we caught a news broadcast declaring\
  \ that a tsunami hit Indonesia\u2019s Sumatra and was plunging its course with deadly\
  \ pandemonium and zero consideration for the devastating destruction in its wake.\n\
  \nThankfully, the authorities approved an early take-off. With only 20 people on\
  \ the entire airplane, we sprawled over seats, but we will never erase the vision\
  \ of watching the airport we just left, get wiped out, washed away by the tsunami\
  \ as watched from the sky and were reminded again, how valuable LIFE really is.\
  \ And how quickly things can change!\n\nFifteen years later, in my mind\u2019s eye,\
  \ I can still see the chaos, still hear the anguished screams of those who were\
  \ afflicted and still be confronted by the disbelief of what my eyes were witnessing\
  \ \u2013 but it will never be able to erase thoughts of lazy, languid days spent\
  \ gazing out at the endless ocean, with Cajun aromas wafting our way as one of the\
  \ island natives catch and cooked our fish on the beach \u2013  feasts of organic\
  \ food and moments of excitement as we snorkeled, island-hopped and hiked our way\
  \ to bliss! \n\nWe still reminisce about how glorious it would be to go back there,\
  \ realizing we could\u2019ve been swept up in the tsunami of 2004, as it wiped out\
  \ the airport and our hotel \u2013 hitting hardest at the bar where we had our last\
  \ drink! \nI didn\u2019t expect to find utopia almost off the grid \u2013 but I\
  \ also didn\u2019t expect that a spectacular Island holiday would conclude with\
  \ us staring in disbelief through tiny little airplane windows as we watched usually-life-affirming\
  \ water, unapologetically tear through the land we just vacated \u2013 but eternally\
  \ grateful for the reminder that life is worth LIVING every single moment on our\
  \ own terms, but in service to humanity \u2013 knowing that it can disappear in\
  \ a split-second \u2013 without warning or permission!"
