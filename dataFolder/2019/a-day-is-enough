Text: "The temperature read -11 -degree Celsius, the clock ticked 8 a.m. Gloomy eyed\
  \ I picked up the phone. Ritu shouted in my ears, \u201CWhy aren't you out of the\
  \ house yet?\" I replied, \u201CLet me sleep in today. I'm tired.\" She threw a\
  \ threat towards me which made me run out of bed like a ninja. We were in Poland\
  \ for a one-month internship.  \n\nI had learned the route a few times earlier to\
  \ visit Kazimierz, the old Jewish town of Poland. There was no direct transportation\
  \ from AGH University in Krakow where we were lodged. I took a bus from the University\
  \ to Galeria Krakowska. The sun was shining but couldn't be felt; it was the month\
  \ of December.  Only a week was left for our Prague vacation. Ritu was away for\
  \ the weekend visiting a relative. Passing by the Museum I noticed an exhibition\
  \ on the history of Poland. On the next building was a huge hoarding from the picture\
  \ of which I had understood it was a play about Hitler.  The bus entered the Main\
  \ Market Square area which was thronging with tourists. Looking at the happy, confused,\
  \ excited, bored, awestruck faces, unknowingly, a smile lit at the corner of my\
  \ lips. \n\nBy the time I reached Galeria, I had successfully forgotten the number\
  \ of the next tram that I had to board. I looked through the tram routes at the\
  \ stoppage only to be disappointed. I crossed the road to the other stoppage. After\
  \ looking through the tram routes on the board, still a little confused I finally\
  \ decided to ask someone. I found a man sitting on the benches, muttering up the\
  \ courage I asked, \"Hi! Can you help me with something?\" He smiled a smile which\
  \ touched his eyes and replied \"Sure.\" It turned out we had a similar destination.\
  \ We started talking, at first it was about Krakow. Then he revealed to be a Masters'\
  \ student in anthropology hence we shifted to education since I was planning to\
  \ pursue master in Europe. \n\nReaching Kazimierz I bade him goodbye, put on my\
  \ headphones and started walking. Suddenly a familiar figure stopped my path. \u201C\
  My friend just called in sick, since I'm already here let me show you around.\"\
  \ With a beam at the corner of my mouth, I agreed. We first visited the Christmas\
  \ market whose tiny shops had varieties like gramophone records,  antiques of Second\
  \ World War, jewelry made of amber. The wind was hitting my bones and the smell\
  \ of Zapiekanka made me salivate. We found a typical Polish restaurant entirely\
  \ decorated with edible vegetables and dark brown polished wooden furniture. While\
  \ eating, \u201CMy name is Aleksander\" he spoke suddenly. He was from Ukraine,\
  \ had relocated to Poland at the age of 18 for a better life. I introduced myself,\
  \ then we started talking about the almost war situation between Ukraine and Russia\
  \ and its effect on Poland. He seemed to be passionate about his country and well\
  \ aware of the current political situation. Before I could realize we were already\
  \ inside one of the synagogues displayed with clothes, utensils, tools, reading\
  \ the painful history of the Jews who had hidden there and finally murdered, about\
  \ their festivals and customs. We went to all the synagogues, the famous musician's\
  \ house, the Jewish cemetery, where I noticed we were holding hands. The clock struck\
  \ 9 p.m, we were sitting across each other in a bar in the heart of Krakow Main\
  \ Square, through the glass walls I could see the jostling crowd, only now I couldn't\
  \ see their face. We exchanged numbers and promised to meet the day before I leave.\
  \ \n\nI never heard from him since that day. I could not find him on any social\
  \ platform, slowly his number stopped working. His only existence is left in my\
  \ memory. That day I had learned something for the first time in my life, I learned\
  \ to fall in love. In love with his smile, his eyes, his smell, his touch, his words,\
  \ his Krakow. In between the bustling dear city I had stumbled upon something unexpected.\
  \ It's true; sometimes a day is all we need to make a memorable memory."
