Text: "When I arrived in Chacahua, there was a rule that I had to learn: \"Chacahua\
  \ will not go at your pace, you have to go to the rhythm of Chacahua\". And thats\
  \ the true: Chacahua is a place where the time is different. Time is based on how\
  \ much you mix your senses with the silence of beach, with the ocean smell and the\
  \ Chacahua mystical people: big and deep eyes, glow skin and the most transparent\
  \ soul you could perceive. The historic Afro-Mexican beauty in all its splendor.\
  \ \nSince I arrived, Chacahua has become an eternal meditation. As a Mexican, I\
  \ could not believe that our country had places that could become an eternal mantra.\
  \ \nTo get to Chacahua, you must cross a large part of the virgin Oaxaca\xB4s countryside:\
  \ fruit crops and corn. At the end of the field, the only way to get there is by\
  \ boat, driven by a small child, to sail over a peaceful lagoon surrounded by a\
  \ wild ocean. \nAnd there I was, in front of my eyes, the lost place, the great\
  \ temple made of sand. a new concept of Mexico, a magic and mysterious Mexico. My\
  \ feet touched the sand and automatically merged with it. I rented a small cabin\
  \ with shared bathroom, a tiny bed and a useless fan. But at that moment I did not\
  \ care: all my whims and city habits had disappeared. That was the Chacahua spell.\
  \ \nI went to eat at a local restaurant: delicious, simple, traditional. Just meat,\
  \ tortilla and beans: the famous local food \"Tasajo\".\nThen, some fresh clams,\
  \ caught by the local children, some mezcal and beer. The must perfect meal of my\
  \ life. \nAfter eating, \nMy only task for 3 days was to lose myself between the\
  \ sound of the sea and the constant brightness of the moon. Touch the sand and cross\
  \ the mangroves in a small kayak.\nEverything was slow and eternal. Everything was\
  \ hot and humid\n\nEverything was a utopian place hidden in Oaxaca called Chacahua"
