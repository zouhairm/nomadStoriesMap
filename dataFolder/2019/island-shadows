Text: "I never pray. But standing in the darkness of this stormy summer night, I do.\
  \ My whole body shakes and a thousand thoughts scream in the silence of my mind.\
  \ I look up to the rough volcano that dominates Pico Island, illuminated by the\
  \ moon, and ask for its strength. For veins made out of lava and a heart of basalt.\
  \ But I am just human.\nA human, who has found a friend. Someone I wrapped my heart\
  \ around like the ocean wraps around the island. Someone who has just revealed a\
  \ truth about himself that destroyed my carefully constructed image of this paradise.\
  \ This man, who I had shared laughs with and with whom I climbed in ancient lava\
  \ caves, was a heroin addict. \n\nSometimes, when you come to a beautiful new place,\
  \ you can see the negative sides right away. Poverty, mass tourism, beaches full\
  \ of plastic, pollution. Not so on the Azores. \nThe archipelago in the middle of\
  \ the Atlantic Ocean may not have the best streets or the fanciest houses you have\
  \ ever seen, but it is incredibly peaceful. No traffic, no rush, no stress. Everyone\
  \ you meet smiles, greets you with a happy \u201CBom dia\u201D and may even invite\
  \ you for self-made drinks and dinner. You eat delicious food and can leave your\
  \ car unlocked, since it is one of the safest places in Europe to travel to. \n\
  The nine islands also look like a paradise, with the black lava cliffs, green fields,\
  \ volcanic lakes and craters of sulfur. The colors are unlike anywhere else, the\
  \ contrast of green, blue and black is so beautiful it almost hurts to look away.\
  \ But there is another contrast, the one everyone looks away from. \nHidden behind\
  \ summer festivals on the coast and the fresh grapes on the vineyards, there is\
  \ a truth about the islands, tourists don\u2019t want to know about. Drugs. \nRight\
  \ between Europe, Africa and the Americas, the Azores are a secret hub for all kinds\
  \ of drugs, from hashish to heroin. Big container ships and small boats both take\
  \ advantage of the isolated location, using them as a platform for transitions and\
  \ to sell parts of their shipment to the local trafficking networks. In September\
  \ of 2018, for instance, 840kg of cocaine were found on a sailboat that was crossing\
  \ the Atlantic, just a few months after the police apprehended 1400kg in a similar\
  \ case. These shiploads alone had a market value of multiple million euros, being\
  \ just two among the countless movements of the intercontinental narco traffic.\n\
  The archipelago itself has one of the highest drug consumption rates in Portugal,\
  \ with cannabis being the most popular drug. For the locals, this is nothing new,\
  \ drug usage and trafficking are open secrets. Since it is so widely known, the\
  \ police is well informed. It is one of their biggest tasks and they even founded\
  \ the UNCTE, a special unit against drug trafficking. Not exactly what you would\
  \ imagine while hiking the laurel forests or watching the stunning waterfalls of\
  \ Flores.\n\nThe Azores remain a utopian destination for tourists, since the two\
  \ worlds don\u2019t meet. But they exist, and sometimes they overlap. When I first\
  \ met my friend, I was blind for the shadows of the island life. He had opened my\
  \ eyes. Not only to the issue, but also to how much I had hoped this paradise was\
  \ flawless. Perfect. Innocent.\nSo I pray. For this Eden-like vision to withstand\
  \ the complex truth of reality. For my friend to stay clean. And for the Azores\
  \ to stay my safe space, my home of heart, where the drama of daily life cannot\
  \ reach me.\nI glimpse at the ocean. Tonight everything before me is a dark void\
  \ of nothingness. I can\u2019t see a thing, but I hear the waves. Come and go. Crashing\
  \ against this little island that was born out of fire. Tiny parts of the wild,\
  \ unapologetic Atlantic, slowly carving away this piece of land. There is no need\
  \ to pray.\nNo place on earth is perfect or innocent, because life in itself is\
  \ never immaculate. It is full of contrasts, of light and shadow. Which makes it\
  \ so entirely wonderful."
