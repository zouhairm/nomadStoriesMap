Text: "It\u2019s disconcertingly quiet. Although it might not be winter, those famously\
  \ cold Eastern winds are blowing and it feels like it is. We walk right down the\
  \ middle of the road we\u2019re on; there\u2019s no need to worry about traffic\
  \ in Pripyat.\n\nIt is an unusual group of eight that are visiting; three Australians,\
  \ two Poles, a middle-aged Ukrainian couple, plus our Ukrainian tour leader Natalia.\
  \ In the days following April 26, 1986, some 120,000 people were evacuated from\
  \ towns surrounding the Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant in northern Ukraine, with\
  \ Pripyat the largest of these. Experts believe the catastrophic nuclear disaster\
  \ that occurred has rendered the town uninhabitable for at least 200 years.  \n\n\
  Tours now run through the Chernobyl \u2018exclusion zone\u2019, an area extending\
  \ 30km in every direction from the site of the nuclear reactor. On the two-hour\
  \ bus drive from Kiev I attempt light conversation with the Ukrainian husband and\
  \ wife but receive only gruff grunts in response. Each to their own, I suppose.\
  \ \n\nAt the entry to the zone, we are handed Geiger counters to measure radioactivity,\
  \ a somewhat ominous gesture that I pretend not to be concerned at. The tour follows\
  \ the very long, very wide gravel road which is the town\u2019s main artery, but\
  \ Natalia stops us routinely. She leads us off the bus into what always appears\
  \ to be total jungle, only for an abandoned kindergarten or town hall to suddenly\
  \ emerge from obscurity.\n\nSoviet propaganda adorns the walls of the town hall\
  \ and a statue of Lenin remains, a step back in time to the world\u2019s biggest\
  \ social experiment. A Ferris wheel sits eerily at a theme park that was scheduled\
  \ to open a week after the disaster, a joy-ride never ridden. A darkly ironic twist\
  \ can be found at the primary school, where piles and piles of unused gas masks\
  \ (to be used in the event of a nuclear disaster) are found.\n\nAll through the\
  \ tour the Ukrainian husband is clearly impatient, bickering with Natalia and wanting\
  \ to get on with things. I wonder why he would spend the money on a tour if he couldn\u2019\
  t be bothered looking around? He is solidly built, and somewhat thuggish looking,\
  \ like a member of an Eastern European mafia. I\u2019m told his name is Oleksiy.\n\
  \nWe stand on the terraces of Avanhard Stadium, where the local football team was\
  \ once cheered on. We walk past abandoned cars, shops and homes. Some houses are\
  \ a wild jungle, some are decaying but still distinguishable as places where human\
  \ beings once lived. The domed roof of the doomed nuclear reactor Number Four looms\
  \ ominously on the horizon all throughout. When we eventually reach it, Oleksiy\
  \ seems even grumpier than before, and decides to stay on the bus.\n\nAs the sun\
  \ sets we arrive at the final stop, a former hotel with a rooftop area that overlooks\
  \ Pripyat. The hotel is central and as a result, you can see everything that is\
  \ (or, was once) a part of the town.\n\nBut this is not what catches my eye. The\
  \ thing that I notice is Oleksiy, looking out over the overgrown forest that now\
  \ strangles the town, tears streaming down his face. His wife, who is consoling\
  \ him, looks at me solemnly and I suddenly understand. Oleksiy has been here before.\
  \ \nHe is from here. \n\nThis is likely the first time he has returned since he\
  \ was evacuated, presumably as a boy. This is confirmed by Natalia. We know no more,\
  \ nor do we press the issue. A pat on the back is all we can offer. I feel guilty\
  \ at my original misconceptions.\n\nWhen we arrive back in Kiev, I thank Natalia\
  \ for her tour and begin to look for a drink. Just as I am about to leave, I feel\
  \ a hand on my arm. It\u2019s Oleksiy.\n\n\u201CThank-you, thank-you,\u201D he is\
  \ saying, shaking hands with everyone. The dramatic transformation from rough, impatient\
  \ thug to warm-hearted Eastern European is complete.\n\n\u201CYou come to Ukraine\
  \ anytime.\u201D\n\nIt seems I have made a local connection, even if he is local\
  \ to a ghost town."
