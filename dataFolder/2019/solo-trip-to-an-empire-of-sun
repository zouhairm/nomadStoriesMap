Text: "I\u2019m on a trip to one of the cities with the richest culture, art and history.\
  \ Where you litteraly walk on the streets were legends walked hundreds and thousands\
  \ years ago and they where making history.  City where the most aesthetic and chic\
  \ styles and currents, Renaissance, Barocco..feel the most familiar. Where every\
  \ building is a piece of art and the entire \u201Cmetropole\u201D  is a huge museum.\n\
  I think you can guess which city I\u2019m visiting. It is Rome.\nRome is very well\
  \ located in one of the best part of the world, it took me 2 hours flight to get\
  \ here from London, if you are from European continent, the flight will take you\
  \ the same amount of hours. On top of that, the prices for the flight tickets are\
  \ very afortable too.\nTo find a convenient accommodation for the price and with\
  \ nice service is not difficult neither, these days there are so many options like\
  \ airbnb, b&b, hotels. \nIn terms of customer service I would rate Rome with the\
  \ excellent mark. A little interesting things that surprises me in the best way\
  \ is that entering a cafe for a coffee you would pay after you will drink it. \n\
  About coffee, wines and food that Italy I can speak hours, but the most of their\
  \ gastronomy is made by their passion and enthusiasm they have for it. \nAnother\
  \ aspect that you easily will notice and will love is the style of serving the food,\
  \ wines, coffee and gelato, it is an absolute magic in the way they live and feel\
  \ it.\nAfter second day in Rome and I managed to see all the most famous places,\
  \ Vatican, Castel Sant\u2019Angelo, Phanteon, Fontana di Trevi, Piazza Venezia,\
  \ Piazza di Spagna, etc. \n\nAs I stay in a hotel next to the city center, I did\
  \ not expect everything to be that close. Having an experience before when I traveled\
  \ to Barcelona and I got an acomodation in zone 4, I was spending 1 hour  on the\
  \ train to get to the city center, I made sure in Rome I\u2019m staying in the city\
  \ center. \nThat is what I have learned so far, if you are doing a short trip to\
  \ a city, the best is to have a place to stay in the center, so you will manage\
  \ your time in a more contructive way.\nIt was a great choice for one more reason,\
  \ I didn\u2019t have the need of using the underground or any other vehicles. If\
  \ you didn\u2019t know like me, Rome has a metro, but is not a very popular transport\
  \ here, the more common are buses, cars and of course motorbikes.\nI always was\
  \ dreaming of riding a vespa on old street of Rome, however haven\u2019t done it\
  \ this time, but this is just another reason to come back. Leaving a reason to come\
  \ back is equal to throwing a coin in Fontana di Trevi, which I haven\u2019t done\
  \ it neither, I prefer to not do things that everyone does.\n\nCreating in advance\
  \  your itinerary, you will be able to do the most of your trip and you will have\
  \ time to enjoy a tasteful Italian dish, like a local, they never rush when the\
  \ things come about having food. \nSometimes they can spend up to 4 hours for a\
  \ dinner, starting at 6pm with a glass of wine and antipasti, and finishing with\
  \ a coffee at 10pm, so it will help your stomach to digest better the food you had.\n\
  Rome is called The empire where the sun never set, in a metaphorical way and in\
  \ a proper way, this city has so much sun, even during the winter the amount of\
  \ sunny days is impressive and air temperatures are so friendly that allow you to\
  \ have an outdoor siting. \nWhat could you ask for more from a city break then enjoying\
  \ a meal in a fresh air being spoiled by the sun with the view  to the historical\
  \ masterpieces?!"
