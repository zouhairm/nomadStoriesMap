Text: 'The first time I went to Portugal, I was looking for answers to the internal
  questions of my mind that permeate the life of any 27-year-old boy. I stepped into
  the land that colonized my country and spent a few days searching the sensations,
  climate, history and people of that place for the motivation I needed to get out
  of my comfort zone, into the bubble of doubts and questions I was in . So I met
  Ana, the 30 years old woman, tanned skin of the European summer, passionate about
  travel, culture and pianist like me, who hosted me in her house. In her smiling
  eyes, I met the person who transformed my life, and on that trip, he took me to
  Morocco - Fez, the bluish city -, made me know from the perspective of a Portuguese
  citizen, the culture and the flavors of Lisbon, we net again few days later in Paris
  and together we saw the Eiffel Tower for the first time, she showed me the colors
  of the world and of life, blew the most beautiful words to my ear and heart and
  since 2015 I do not met her anymore because we live in countries separated by an
  ocean, whoever connected by the same passion: to travel. My going to Europe in 2015
  changed my values, my vision of the world and brought me the person for whom I most
  idealized to spend the life together. To travel is love, to love is to travel.'
