Text: "I'm by no stretch of the imagination old, however back in 2005 I was definitely\
  \ young- 10 years young that is to be exact. I was living a care free life, as you\
  \ do in London, spending my days riding bikes and doing the stupid kids do. It wasn\u2019\
  t strange when my parents decided we were long overdue a visit to the mother land,\
  \ Somalia. I mean we were English, albeit not at the first glance, but in every\
  \ other way. So this trip was essentially a way of making us \u201Cmore Somali\u201D\
  .\n\nAnyway, I can\u2019t say that the idea of travelling to Somalia really stuck\
  \ a place of excitement but the idea of getting there really peaked my interest.\
  \ At this point in my life I\u2019d never been out of the country, let alone out\
  \ of the continent. So as to be expected, I couldn\u2019t think of anything else\
  \ other than getting on a plane. Well, after a year of packing and repacking my\
  \ little suitcase, the day finally arrived. I remember it being the first day of\
  \ the summer holidays. It was a warm morning and the air was electric. \n\nHeathrow\
  \ to Dubai then straight Dubai to Somalia. \n\nInstantly, the heat struck my little\
  \ face and I knew then: I was very, very far from home. I remember feeling a wave\
  \ of emotion hitting me as I stepped of the tiny plane. For some reason I was overwhelmed\
  \ at the site of tarmac meeting sandy floors instead of a well laid out concrete\
  \ path. In that moment, instead of thinking of a tropical warm land, my mind went\
  \ to those aid ads we know all too well. \n\nWalking through an airport that had\
  \ to have been 8x8 metres confused me too. I saw no metal detectors or visible security\
  \ measures. Looking back I realise no one coming to the country was really a threat,\
  \ the people who were threats were already here.  \n\nMy uncle came to pick us up\
  \ in his truck, the females were told to get inside while my brothers and father\
  \ joined me in the back. The road, or should I say sandy track was the absolute\
  \ worst. The road was not laid and we\u2019d often fall through large gaping holes\
  \ which would throw half of us one way and the rest of us up into the air. Strangely\
  \ though my father wore a smile of familiarity. I understand now that to him this\
  \ was a throwback to his younger years, not the London school of thought with traffic\
  \ lights and weird shaped lines sprawled across the tarmac. He smiled almost all\
  \ the way. I remember him laughing while we slid around the back of the truck, all\
  \ the while he sat masterfully in the corner, resting one arm on the side and smoking\
  \ a cigarette. What a man!\n\nAfter surviving the slalom streets of Somalia, we\
  \ made it a sparse street with very few people around. I say street really it was\
  \ a space with a few gated houses that were vaguely attached, online by locality\
  \ though. One house stood derelict with goats grazing what little weeds they could\
  \ find. Another, on the left of my house a few meters away, was hidden by giant\
  \ green gates. I couldn\u2019t tell if a tent stood inside or a derelict ruin. \n\
  \nWhen we disembarked the vehicle, we all warmly embraced the floor- sandy or otherwise.\
  \ We entered the closed purple gates and what sat before me was a beautiful bungalow\
  \ stretching a couple hundred metres. I was quite impressed by the beauty of the\
  \ mosaic pattern that hugged the steps and front of the house. From the rusted purple\
  \ gates outside I was expecting derelict wooden floor with spiders and all manner\
  \ of atrocities.\n\nThat was the first pleasant surprise I came across, and along\
  \ the way, I saw countless more. I realise now, 14 years older, beauty isn\u2019\
  t just found in pretty sunsets and awesome architecture, it\u2019s also seen through\
  \ the smiles of those around you and the warmth if an unfettered bliss.\n\nSomalia\
  \ may not be the best, but it\u2019s pretty great if you ask me, and that\u2019\
  s looking through these old eyes."
