Text: "Nepal. What appears first when you think? hear the country? Everest Mountain?\
  \ The Himalayas? In fact, we had never imagined that we would go to this country.\
  \ It's beyond expectations. This country is truly extraordinary and exotic and is\
  \ able to enchant the souls of adventurers and wanderers. Well, we are truly enchanted\
  \ by the hospitality of its people and the magnificent splendor of the mountains.\
  \ \n\nIt was the first time, we set foot first in Nepal. We were welcomed when we\
  \ arrived at Tribuvan International Airport which is the the only international\
  \ airport in Nepal. This airport is not too big and has an ancient and unique architecture.\
  \ Travel from Indonesia to Nepal takes around 6 hours.\nNepal is one of the poorest\
  \ countries in the world. Kathmandu is the capital city of Nepal which is also one\
  \ of the cities with the cost of living lowest in the world. Nepal also has problems\
  \ in politics causing a lot of things to be hampered. In 2015, there are 339,000\
  \ Nepalese children cannot continue school because they have no choice to determine\
  \ their future. Besides that there are many social problems which hit Nepal like\
  \ the poor quality of health, hygiene and facilities sanitation. Nepal's economic\
  \ sector is only dependent on tourism. We will help them then we go there to spread\
  \ our usefulness to carry out social missions.\nOur journey began in Kathmandu.\
  \ We went to Public School and walked distance approximately five kilometers from\
  \ our hostel using a antique Nepalese bus. After we arrived , we met all students\
  \ and asked them to draw their dreams in the future at the same time introducing\
  \ Indonesian culture. The students were very enthusiastic. After\nfinished to draw,\
  \ they showed their work with present their pictures in front of the class. They\
  \ wanted to be doctors, police, artists, football players, teachers, astronauts,\
  \ and others. After we sang national song together. There are unique and interesting\
  \ events after the event is over. \n\nStudents were very happy with our arrival\
  \ so many students\nasking for autographs, exchanging social media accounts and\
  \ even asking for photos of Indonesian passports and money. \nThe extraordinary\
  \ enthusiasm of the students to continue to pursue dreams in a life that is limited\
  \ and rises from adversity really deserves a thumbs up.\n\nThe students who dare\
  \ to come to the front of the class and answer questions given will get special\
  \ prize from us. The prize is in the form of notebooks, sharpeners, pencils, and\n\
  candy. Then, we did training to students how to wash hands and brush teeth properly.\
  \ It's fun to see funny behavior when brushing their teeth. Even more funny, one\
  \ of the teachers also joined and brush his teeth in the middle of the crowd of\
  \ students. Besides that we also provided medical check-up services to the teachers.\n\
  \nIn the last day, we gave workshop on entrepreneurship in tourism to young people\n\
  located at the Kanti Cultural Center. They were given the task of making videos\
  \ about tourism in Nepal then posted it on Instagram. Enthusiasm and curiosity\n\
  high seen from the look on the faces of these young people. They try to\npromoting\
  \ tourism in Nepal as attractive as possible with style and their characteristics.\
  \ \n\n\n\n\nThe closing day was also enlivened by an art performance by the delegation\
  \ in order to introduce Indonesian culture to children young Nepalese. They performed\
  \ the Kecak dance, Bengkulu, Ondel-Ondel Jakarta and singing compulsory songs from\
  \ each country. After they\nperformed arts shows, we are given a Nepalese hat and\
  \ pashmina to then continued with a took photo together.\n \nNepalese children have\
  \ taught us about meaning enthusiasm for life, optimism, and hard work. The earthquake\
  \ that rocked Nepal 7.9 The Richter Scale in April 2015 did not make their enthusiasm\
  \ fade. They rise from adversity and rebuild the exoticism of their country. Besides\
  \  natural exoticism and cultural wealth in Nepal has made us enchanted can stop\
  \ in our country again. However, it will never be replaced with our love for the\
  \ country. We will always be anyway love Indonesia because we have scented red and\
  \ white in the land of the roof world."
