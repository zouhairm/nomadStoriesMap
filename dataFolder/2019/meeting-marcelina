Text: "Meet Marcellina (pronounced \u2018Marthelina\u2019)...she is an 85 year old\
  \ local villager from a town in Asturias, Spain. I had sat on this bench that is\
  \ on a part of the Camino de Santiago which runs through this old town. 1 min after\
  \ I sat down on a weathered park bench over looking a valley, she waddled up with\
  \ her waking stick, took a seat next to me and started to tell me her life story.\
  \ She has lived in this town for 55years. She can speak Spanish and French. She\
  \ has 7 children however sadly she lost her first when she was married at 17 years\
  \ old. Her kids all live off in other cities in Asturias. She has many Grand kids\
  \ too some healthy some with severe health problems like her. She walks 50m up the\
  \ road to sit on this bench mainly after she eats, for exercise, to think and also\
  \ because the bench she sits on down the road with her friends is dangerous because\
  \ roof tiles fall down onto the street there. (This is true, I look down the street\
  \ and her 2 friends are there yapping away oblivious to the shattered tiles on the\
  \ ground around them \U0001F602) She tells us that she sat on this bench by herself\
  \ last night through til the morning because she has trouble sleeping and looking\
  \ out at the Valley gives her \u2018peace.\u2019 She said that her life has been\
  \ filled with good but also a lot of pain. She didn\u2019t seem to be bitter nor\
  \  complain about her life at all however, she was quite matter of fact and honest\
  \ about it. Some advice she lent was to travel and see the world and also try avoid\
  \ marriage these days. She lost her husband (whom she loved and apparently was very\
  \ handsome) many years ago but she never bothered to marry again. When we asked\
  \ her for a photograph her response translated was \u201C of course take one so\
  \ you can remember me!\u201D This conversation took place over 20mins, whilst on\
  \ a detour stop to Salamanca. @giselle89 thanks for translating \u2764\uFE0F#ohthepeopleyoumeet\
