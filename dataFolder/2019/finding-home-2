Text: "Madrid, 21st of February 2019. \n\nMy room is dark, and next to my round bedside\
  \ table, which I had struggled to carry home on the streets of Madrid due to its\
  \ size, was a black alarm clock that would\u2019ve showed that the time was near\
  \ midnight, if only I had put batteries inside it. My body was tired; my mind was\
  \ tired. Normally, my leopard patterned heels, stilettos, and the extremely high\
  \ black leather heels would be neatly arranged against the wall opposite of my bed,\
  \ and what I had branded my \u201Cgranny shoes\u201D and other work shoes would\
  \ be neatly clustered in front of my wardrobe. Tonight, my grey cardigan and other\
  \ clothes cluttered my desk and chair, with a neon yellow bag and my sports bag\
  \ spread out across the small area I inhabited in the city. The darkness hid all\
  \ of my chaos and I was content that I didn\u2019t have to look into the eye of\
  \ the mess that had appeared.\n\nSpaniards had a habit of eagerly interrupting ones\u2019\
  \ friends and family with a new chain of thought in the conversation, and based\
  \ on the noise level outside, this habit was tangible. Roaring drunken laughter\
  \ found its way into my room. When I grew up, before I had plunged out into the\
  \ world carrying with me heavy suitcases and watched my parents crunched up foreheads\
  \ and lifted eyebrows wave me goodbye, I would grow full of annoyance over the rare\
  \ occasions my parents would host a minor gathering post my bed time. Tired, I would\
  \ lull myself to sleep, only to be disturbed and startled by a group of adults bursting\
  \ out in laughter. Now, I lived on top of 4 bars, drunken shouts, laughter, cigarette\
  \ smoke and loud American accents and distinct Spanish dialects consisted of my\
  \ everyday life. \n\nJanuary had not been as kind as promised. I had been stripped\
  \ of my old iPhone and my metro card, of 350 euros to buy a Samsung phone I didn\u2019\
  t like, and my Madrid best friend as she ventured home for good by the end of the\
  \ month and the commencing of February. My attempt to investigate what had taken\
  \ place between me and the one tinder date I liked had gone down the drain, or rather,\
  \ had been found in the missing responses to my text messages.\n\nMy self esteem\
  \ had had a turbulent start, never the less. To top it off, I was carrying around\
  \ on extra weight from Christmas, almost as heavy as the dark cloud circling around\
  \ my head non stop, except you could actually cut off a physical chunk that formed\
  \ the love handles around my hips, but the thoughts circling my mind no. \n\nI had\
  \ plunged into the unknown when accepting a prestigious but long-term unpaid internship\
  \ at the start of last fall, hoping to improve my Spanish enough to become fluent,\
  \ to polish my resume into perfection and to find the answers to all my existential\
  \ life questions somewhere between all my wild nights out and the tapas I would\
  \ consume. To my dismay, I let myself down. I worked long hours, went on tons of\
  \ events per week, and one day settled in; I was still learning at work, but was\
  \ no longer fulfilled with the pride of indulging in a non stop consumption of learning\
  \ and growth. Settled. Comfortable. Disappointed. \n\nNew years and I returned home,\
  \ home to Madrid. The shelf on top of my heather no longer just carried decorations\
  \ but books and suddenly, between black and white pages, google translate, a notebook\
  \ filled to the brim with Spanish words in my ugly handwriting, and between the\
  \ loud noises of people underneath my window, I found home. My second home was what\
  \ I refer to as an \u2018old people\u2019s caf\xE9\u2019 by Alonso Cano; sweet chocolate\
  \ pastries and bitter Americanos was my new living room. \n\nI had filled my passport\
  \ to the brink, with years in the UK, Japan, the US, Poland, Mexico, and journeying\
  \ through Kashmir and Himalayan mountains, and yet for the first time, I felt lulled\
  \ into safety. I felt at home.\n\nHome by loud bars and in the pages of second hand\
  \ books."
