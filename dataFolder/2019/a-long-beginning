Text: "Finding myself alone in Peru was a moment that almost became a nightmare when\
  \ I was suffocating with fear of the unknown. I had tried to preplan so that these\
  \ fears could be massaged and a sense of security could calm my anxious self but\
  \ what you quickly learn as a solo backpacker is that plans change. I had planned\
  \ to stay at a hostel for two nights before making my way up to the North of Peru.\
  \ A 24-hour bus journey I was dreading, but I knew there was someone familiar that\
  \ would receive me on the other side. A lover no less. I just had to get through\
  \ two days alone in the capital city and ring in the new year with some friendly\
  \ faces that I had to find in the next few hours.\nHostel culture is an interesting\
  \ one. You meet so many passers-by, groups already formed, individuals with their\
  \ own agenda, small talk ensues and before you know it you're out for lunch with\
  \ an array of different nationalities. This particular beat started with the same\
  \ rhythm but quickly picked up pace. As I settled into my dorm room a striking boy\
  \ walked in. The kind that's hard to not take a second glance at and instantly the\
  \ energy within me changed. My fear was suddenly diluted by curiosity and the small\
  \ talk began. Basic profile backgrounds, but it doesn't take long to realise you\
  \ and this person are just going to vibe. \nBy the end of our conversation a few\
  \ more people had piped in and a group was formed to go and explore the city. Lima\
  \ had a kind familiarity to it. The comfort of being on the coast was refreshing\
  \ and it didn't take long for the fear that had engulfed me that very same morning\
  \ to brush away gently and expose me with the magic of a new place.\nAs the day\
  \ drew to an end, ringing in the new year didn't particularly feel like a priority\
  \ anymore as the jetlag set in. But, I pushed myself to see the fireworks and make\
  \ my new years wish for more moments like this, in the alchemy of new experiences\
  \ that connected me with strangers and reconnected me with myself. Everything was\
  \ off to a good start.\nThe boy I had met in the hostel quickly became a friend\
  \ and the next day was spent lazily wondering, exchanging travel stories of the\
  \ past and plans for the future. While I explained my plan to quickly head up North\
  \ he stopped me. \"Come and join us for two weeks before you go all the way up.\"\
  \ It really didn't take me long to make up my mind and the 4 months of not seeing\
  \ this lover could be extended by another two weeks so that I could make the most\
  \ of an opportunity to travel with people I was comfortable with. Just like that,\
  \ a new plan was formed.\nTwo weeks of incredible adventure. Sand dunes, Canyons,\
  \ and Macchu Picchu all the while forming friendships I wanted to keep forever.\
  \  This same hostel friend encouraged me to keep going on to Bolivia as I was so\
  \ close. He mapped an itinerary for me and told me two more weeks would be worth\
  \ it. He encouraged me to go alone as he was staying on in Cusco and with his spirit\
  \ of adventure I set off to a country I hadn't even planned on going to. By the\
  \ end, it was now a whole month that I had left this lover waiting for me in the\
  \ North (he was teaching so was there permanently) and in the end, I took a 48-hour\
  \ bus journey to get there. Just another adventure I hadn't planned on and full\
  \ sense of accomplishment for what I had achieved from the unknown.\n\nThe lover\
  \ and I had a good run and spent a few months teaching and growing together but\
  \ the relationship came to an end. Now, five years later I am in a relationship\
  \ with the love of my life that I would never have met had I not been alone in that\
  \ hostel in Peru. Yes, It's him."
