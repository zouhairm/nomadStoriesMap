Text: "There are moments in my life I couldn't have designed better in my head than\
  \ how life brings them to me. Morocco surprised me already for the second time with\
  \ such moments. And I am wondering if this has anything to do with the \"Thousand\
  \ and One Night\" fairy-tale image this country has. Five years ago I was stranded\
  \ in Morocco because the cruise, my boyfriend was working on, couldn't pick me up.\
  \ I had two of the most adventurous days in my life, finding myself at a place I\
  \ was not prepared for at all \u2013 facing all sorts of lessons, from trusting\
  \ other people and falling for their sneaky tricks to finally trusting myself. Five\
  \ years and many travels later, I arrived to the land of camels and tagine again.\
  \ This time I was expected and welcomed by a group of my closest friends in a Moroccan\
  \ palace, a so-called \"Riad\", in the middle of Marrakesh. It was all safe. I could\
  \ just let myself drift with the joyous flow.\n\"Lisa, you have two options for\
  \ tomorrow \u2013 part of the group goes for a trekking tour in the Atlas mountains,\
  \ the rest joins the Game of Throne\u2019s tour\", my friend Lewis pronounced after\
  \ my arrival at the Riad. \"Thank you. I think I just want to stay here\u201D \u2013\
  \ my answer popped out as quickly as a champagne cork. \nSo, here I was again, alone\
  \ in Marrakesh. A bit ironic, I found, when I was sitting on the huge table all\
  \ alone, enjoying my breakfast, whereas my friends had a fun day out. But before\
  \ I could dwell on those thoughts, Jawad, the host of the Riad, stood next to me\
  \ with his huge, beautiful smile, handing me a map of Marrakesh, added by his private\
  \ phone number. I was ready for another Moroccan adventure.\nWandering through the\
  \ \"Souks\", the labyrinth of markets in the old town, I realized that I am much\
  \ more relaxed than last time. With awe I floated through the dark passages, illuminated\
  \ by rays of sunlight and the bright colours of scarfs, carpets and glass lamps.\
  \ I didn't even realize that a guy was following me already for five minutes, when\
  \ an expat made me aware of it. It was not an accident that a second earlier a sign,\
  \ pointing to a vegan \"Earth Cafe\", had aroused my attention. I spontaneously\
  \ left my path \u2013 and my follower \u2013 for a delicious fruit juice, accompanied\
  \ by a lovely lady from London, who I talked with about life, photography and the\
  \ joy of traveling alone. She even shared her lunch with me. Full of positive energy\
  \ I could throw myself into the souk-madness again. \nThe way back to the Riad was\
  \ more complicated than expected. A few metres before my goal, I lost my way in\
  \ the dark alleys \u2013 streets that you enter and actually pray that no one is\
  \ after you. I would have loved to see the relief on my face when Jawad opened the\
  \ door to the little palace I could call my home for a few nights. A pot of mint\
  \ tea on the rooftop terrace helped me recovering from the rush of adrenalin. \n\
  Two more hours to go until my friends would be back and I started to become hungry.\
  \ The mere idea of walking through the souk again gave me shivers. But the universe\
  \ had better plans with me \u2013 or in that case, our charming host with the beautiful\
  \ smile. And there I was, sitting on the back of Jawad\u2019s motorbike, (st)rolling\
  \ through the ancient streets of Marrakesh. We stopped at his brother\u2019s snack\
  \ bar for a late lunch. A big group of tourists walked by \u2013 it were my friends,\
  \ who came back from their trip, looking at me surprised and amused at the same\
  \ time. All I thought was, \u201CHow could I have been looking for safety, when\
  \ this was what traveling is all about? A jump into cold water.\u201D \nOn our bike-ride\
  \ back to the Riad, Jawad and me started singing \u201CWhat a wonderful world\u201D\
  , followed by \u201CNon, je ne regrette rien\". It was almost too cheesy, but it\
  \ was my own Moroccan dream and I loved it."
