Text: "It seemed an exciting idea at the time. After four weeks touring Turkey on\
  \ a bumpy bus full of strangers and with a battered suitcase minus one wheel, the\
  \ invitation from husband to join him in Tokyo for a few days was revitalizing.\n\
  \ \nTravelling with an astute and shrewd knowledge of cheap fares and some tricky\
  \ flight manoeuvres, I was quickly ticketed, albeit standby. \n\u201C\u2026.excellent,\
  \ let\u2019s go\u2026I\u2019m so cool.\u201D \nI was confident and looking forward\
  \ to Turkish Airlines TK52, direct service from Istanbul Ataturk Airport to Tokyo\
  \ Narita. In eleven hours and thirty minutes I\u2019d be landing, ready for a cultural\
  \ interchange. \n\nMy palate tingled as thoughts of swapping g\xF6zleme for gyoza\
  \ flashed by; the change from Menemen and \xE7\u0131lb\u0131r for cleansing seaweed\
  \ sushi was appealing. Instead of the heavier and traditional meaty Anatolian \u201C\
  Testi Kebab\u201D casserole for dinner, I\u2019d be slurping sukiyaki. My taste\
  \ buds salivated, almost tasting sashimi...raw, thinly sliced and served with soy\
  \ sauce and lemon. I was ready for a liver detox. \n\nAt the check in counter, the\
  \ clerk mentioned the flight was heavily booked. Always the optimist, I decided\
  \ to take my chances, hoping for one \u2018no-show\u2019 passenger, allowing me\
  \ that precious seat, so I checked my suitcase \u2013 glad to let someone else deal\
  \ with the wonky wheel. \nPacing at the gate, I counted anxious minutes tick by\
  \ as hundreds of passengers presented boarding passes and trotted down the air-bridge,\
  \ farewelling Turkey. For folk like me who travel habitually, the hectic standby\
  \ caper is always a gamble. Soon the gate lounge emptied except for a couple of\
  \ scrambling Indian passengers who obviously lost track of time at duty free. \n\
  With only twelve minutes to spare, the airline staff signalled to me that the FLIGHT\
  \ WAS FULL...BAD LUCK. \nSuddenly a glamorous international globe-trotting adventure\
  \ became a train wreck! \n\nTwo immigration officers presented themselves, as I\
  \ was now deemed an illegal person. My visa was no longer valid as I\u2019d passed\
  \ through Turkish immigration, my passport stamped EXITED & DEPARTED. With a security\
  \ guard on either side, each armed, we tracked through miles of passages and passed\
  \ dusty rooms regular travellers never see. I had to surrender my passport while\
  \ they escorted me to the general public area. I thought it strange at the time.\
  \ They told me to go downstairs and \u201Cpush a button\u201D at a certain green\
  \ door and wait. My heart was sick. I was an alien and alone.\n\nFinally the door\
  \ opened...he spoke Turkish, I spoke English. Trying to explain that I wanted my\
  \ suitcase retrieved from the flight to Japan was an impossible calamity. Ataturk\
  \ International Airport handles around forty two million passengers annually and\
  \ my suitcase was OUT THERE, being handled. \nHe bid me follow him; to wait in isolation\
  \ in a tiny office but kindly, offered me coffee. Caffeine was the last stimulation\
  \ I needed. I was alone with only my pounding heartbeat and nervous sweat; no passport,\
  \ no luggage, no Turkish lire, no local language, left helpless and agonising, \u201C\
  what happens next to an illegal \xE9migr\xE9 as I was now?\u201D \n\nSeventy five\
  \ minutes passed and I was crazy with anxiety. Suddenly, my suitcase appeared, its\
  \ missing wheel a dead give-away. I was instructed to walk further on, through to\
  \ another classified area and at the far end, ask at a desk for my passport.\n \n\
  Of course, this is exactly what an alien would do! How simple is that.\n\nThe officer\
  \ casually flipped through a stack of approximately twenty passports and handed\
  \ mine over. Miracles do happen. He was nonchalant while I was senseless. Apprehensively\
  \ my nervous fingers gripped that little blue booklet. Seeing its gold insignia\
  \ and Australia printed boldly and proudly on the cover caused a surge of vitality\
  \ and instant relief.\n\nSuch unbounded release made my head swirl. I was somebody\
  \ again. \nI belonged...thank you Australia for owning me. Let me come home."
