Text: "\u201CI\u2019m not as happy as I thought I was\u201D. The phrase coming from\
  \ my boyfriend\u2019s mouth seemed to somehow stop the time and the sound of the\
  \ flamenco dancer\u2019s shoes on the old wooden stage. I was sure I was in one\
  \ of those bad movies where everyone would shut up, the dancers would stop dancing\
  \ and they would all look at us and hear how the man I moved to another country\
  \ for is breaking up with me. Luckily, after I caught my breath, I noticed that\
  \ all the other patrons were enjoying their night and the dancers were performing\
  \ fiercer than ever. \n                   I was supposed to be spending a romantic\
  \ weekend in Barcelona with my boyfriend, after we had been apart for 5 weeks, due\
  \ to the training he was doing in northern Spain. I had flown in early that morning\
  \ from our place in Germany to meet him and so far we were having a \u201Cnormal\u201D\
  \ day as a couple until this ridiculous Spanish telenovela occurred. I do call that\
  \ day, the day I died. I cannot imagine that someone can actually get dumped in\
  \ the middle of a flamenco show in an old traditional restaurant in El Poble Espanol\
  \ in Barcelona, but that\u2019s exactly what was happening to me. I don\u2019t exactly\
  \ recall how we got to our hotel afterward, all I know is that my head was spinning,\
  \ the last two years of my life were flying by right in front of me and a deep fear\
  \ of the unknown was giving me the creeps. I spent most of the night crying in the\
  \ bathroom or in bed next to him, as we were, of course, sharing a room. \n    \
  \               The next day was unfortunately beautiful, it was Barcelona after\
  \ all, even in November. As his train was leaving later in the evening and my flight\
  \ was only the next day, we figured we would go out and do some sight-seeing while\
  \ we\u2019re breaking up. I was pretty much a ghost the entire time, seeing everything\
  \ as if through the lens of a camera shooting in fish-eye mode. People and cars\
  \ were passing by, I heard sounds, music, waves, seagulls, smelled the salty air,\
  \ felt the taste of cheese and wine we had at a tavern by the sea. Not sure I was\
  \ eating though. I know it\u2019s impossible but I was sure that everyone who saw\
  \ us or talked to us that day knew that he dumped me. I was walking around like\
  \ I was his victim, my wounds not shown to the public eye, but bleeding deeply on\
  \ the inside. While we were admiring some yachts in the harbor, he struck up a conversation\
  \ with a rich American who was thinking of buying one. That guy was definitely on\
  \ my side because I don\u2019t remember what I said, but he told my ex-boyfriend:\
  \ \u201CThis one\u2019s a keeper! You\u2019re a lucky man!\u201D. I never knew whether\
  \ to laugh or to cry that day, I was dancing in between both options constantly.\
  \ \n                   In the evening, I even accompanied him to the train station,\
  \ can\u2019t really tell why. Everything was blurry and all I could hear was how\
  \ he was telling me that we can\u2019t exactly travel around the world together\
  \ because I\u2019m not making enough money as a performer. Looking at the charming\
  \ Spanish subway station, as we were going down the stairs, I managed to reply \u201C\
  \ There we are, we\u2019re in Barcelona, we\u2019re traveling\u201D. \u201CThat\u2019\
  s not traveling, traveling is going to the Bahamas\u201D-he replied promptly. Always\
  \ had a good argument that man, who can argue with \u201Cthe Bahamas\u201D?\n  \
  \                 That night I bought myself two beers and a bag of chips and saw\
  \ \u201CJames Bond\u201D in the hotel room. The next day I was about to leap into\
  \ the unknown of starting all over again back in Germany. But that hotel wasn\u2019\
  t going to let go of me too easily. As I was checking out and paying for the coffee\
  \ we both had the previous morning, the receptionist called me by my ex-boyfriend\u2019\
  s last name. Funny how the first time someone thought we were married was a day\
  \ after we broke up."
