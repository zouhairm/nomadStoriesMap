Text: "Before coming to Ottawa, I knew there was a gay bar near our place. My friend\
  \ fell asleep after a long day: an overnight flight, a three-hour wait for the bus\
  \ and a two-hour trip from Montr\xE9al in the middle of the winter. I was tired\
  \ too, but it was Thursday and I felt like exploring the city during the night.\
  \ It was the warmest night of the time I spent there, so it looked like a perfect\
  \ night to go to the gay bar I read about before. I've always heard Canadians are\
  \ really nice people, and it happened to be true. That night was one of the best\
  \ I had during that entire trip.\n\nI first arrived to a small bar thinking it was\
  \ the gay bar, but I was wrong. I asked for a drink and the nice bartender lady\
  \ asked for my ID. I showed her my passport.\n\"No way!\", she said, \"I'm also\
  \ a Mexican!\", she exclaimed loudly in Spanish.\nShe invited me two tequila shots\
  \ in honor of our Mexican connection and we had a very nice conversation about how\
  \ her father moved to Ottawa looking for a better life; it is very common to hear\
  \ stories about Mexican people moving to the United States, but it's not common\
  \ when people go to Canada, mostly because Mexican people are afraid of cold weather\
  \ \u2014 it is not too common to get temperatures as low as -10\xBAC.\n\"Come over\
  \ whenever you want to while you're here\", she said nicely while giving me a hug.\
  \ \"It's not common to meet people from Mexico in Ottawa, specially in the middle\
  \ of the winter, you must be crazy!\"\n\"A lot of people was telling me I was crazy\
  \ for coming to Canada this time of the year\", I said. They can't blame me for\
  \ wanting me to experience the snow. I asked her where the gay bar was and she told\
  \ me it was upstairs.\n\nI got into the gay bar and it reminded me to one of my\
  \ favorites in Mexico City. It was pretty empty, but I knew it would be because\
  \ it was Thursday in a small town when it was freezing outside. I was sitting alone\
  \ and I asked for a beer, I didn't need much alcohol after that nice Mexican lady\
  \ invited me some drinks. After a few minutes I was considering to go back to my\
  \ place to get some sleep, but the DJ played one of my favorite songs from my favorite\
  \ artist, \"Mean\" by Taylor Swift. There was a guy and a girl dancing in the middle\
  \ of the floor, so I joined them while singing loud.\n\"You don't look familiar,\
  \ are you new here?\", the guy asked me after the song finished.\n\"I'm visiting,\
  \ from Mexico\", I said.\n\"I was in Puerto Vallarta a week ago!\"\nHe introduced\
  \ to me as Joel, a good looking blonde guy. Then he introduced me to his friends,\
  \ who were there celebrating someone's birthday. Now I wasn't alone. We had a chat\
  \ and he kept inviting me drinks until we were drunk. I felt a strong attraction\
  \ to him, but I didn't try anything because I am a very shy person when it comes\
  \ to flirt with someone. I was about to leave, and when I said goodbye he approached\
  \ me and gave me a kiss. It was very unexpected because I thought he didn't like\
  \ me. He asked me if he could walk with me into my place, and I said yes.\nWhile\
  \ walking there, he got a call from one of his friends asking if he would join to\
  \ have poutine in a dinner place near there. I didn't know what poutine was, but\
  \ then I learned it is Canada's National Dish, and it is actually very delicious.\
  \ He then left me at my place and exchanged numbers.\n\nThat whole week I was in\
  \ Ottawa, Joel would show me around the city, along with my friend. I've read stories\
  \ about what people call \"Summer Love\", I gave it a twist and I call mine a \"\
  Winter Love\", a very short one by the way."
