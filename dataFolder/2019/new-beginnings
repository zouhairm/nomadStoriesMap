Text: "My love for travel began 7 years ago. I was 15 years old traveling solo on\
  \ an 22 hour Amtrak from Salt Lake, Utah to Bozeman, Montana. I had never traveled\
  \ alone before and had only been to one other state at this point, and of course\
  \ I was terrified. Upon departure I was anxious and unsure of what lies ahead but\
  \ I knew that it would be a good learning experience. \nI spoke with several various\
  \ people, and learned a little bit about each ones lives. These interactions are\
  \ one of the main occurrences that paved the way for my desire to travel solo; being\
  \ able to make long-lasting connections with like-minded individuals.  \nUpon arrival\
  \ I had found out that my sister would be working a majority of the time I would\
  \ be there, so she would be unable to adventure with me and show me the city. Luckily\
  \ she lived about a 5 minute walk from main street. So, every day I would venture\
  \ out and walk main street weaving in and out of the bars and boutiques. No matter\
  \ how many times I would go into a store, there would always be things to intrigue\
  \ me. That was the second reason that travel excited me so much the difference in\
  \ culture, things, and people."
