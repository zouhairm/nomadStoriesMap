Text: "\u201CJoselina, who are you?\u201D shouted the mother of the buoyantly skipping\
  \ 3 year-old.  The girl came out to the rusted terrace. \u201CWho are you?\u201D\
  \ the mother repeated in English.  Joselina, suddenly poised and astute recited,\
  \ \u201CI am Fidel!\u201D before resuming her somersault practice.  The mother gave\
  \ a sigh of resignation.   \u201CSee! This is the nonsense I am talking about. \
  \ It just started after his death.\u201D  She lamented that Joselina\u2019s teacher\
  \ had instructed the children to watch the nightly news.   \u201CWhy does a 3yr\
  \ old need to watch the news?\" she tolled.  \"It\u2019s crazy here!\u201D \n  \
  \   We met the 35-yr old mother, Yulle, while waiting in line at the famous Coppelia\
  \ ice cream shop in Havana.   Legend has it that many coup attempts were plotted\
  \ there.  Around the shop is a cracked and crumbling neighborhood, but the spaceship-like,\
  \ state-owned oasis, with its reigning red and blue testament to revolution, remains\
  \ in tact.   People line up for hours to have a seat at Havana\u2019s cheapest social\
  \ outlet.  \nAfter advising us on the line etiquette, Yulle bravely decided to join\
  \ us for some scoops.  She vented of exhaustion. As an economist she\u2019d been\
  \ struggling to feed her family with her typical Cuban state wage of $20 per month.\
  \ So, for the past month she had been taking night courses in tourism, as this was\
  \ the only legitimate way to increase one\u2019s earnings.  The other option is\
  \ to sell repurposed goods at bus stop-black markets. (Should Cuba ever fully open\
  \ to capitalism, Cuban\u2019s will be ahead of the hustle).   \n    Yulle went on\
  \ to describe the details of hardship most people have faced in the last 55 years\
  \ and her frustration with the lack of jobs for highly educated citizens.  Her husband,\
  \ a 6ft tall alpha Afrocuban, ran one of the state-owned ration centers.  Though\
  \ she had two master\u2019s degrees, he was still the bread-winner. She relished\
  \ that today it is perfectly normal for a woman in Havana to live alone without\
  \ scorn, virtually unheard of 20 years ago.  Though she epitomized the modern woman\
  \ - confident, educated, outspoken and deploring the communist ideology \u2013 she\
  \ also expressed resignation.  It came as a surprise when she confided in us that\
  \ the days after Fidel\u2019s death had been a very sad time for her.  Regardless\
  \ of her indignation toward him, Fidel was the only father she had ever known, her\
  \ people\u2019s keeper, and with his face posted in every billboard and crevice,\
  \ her primary aesthetic reference.  Yulle became vulnerable.  The system she had\
  \ so openly dismissed seemed to bear no responsibility to the man who instated it.\
  \   Oddly, his deceased aura produced a sense of abandonment and the uneasy recognition\
  \ of any parent-child left to fend for herself.\n     For solace, Yulle whipped\
  \ up an excuse to join us that evening at the 1830 nightclub.  She\u2019d heard\
  \ much about the revered institution but had never afforded the opportunity to attend.\
  \  To hide from her husband, she decided to wait at our Casa as we got ready.  The\
  \ white dona answered the door and gave Yulle the scornful look of a grouchy old\
  \ woman deterring her gringas\u2019 late night male exploits.  The racial disconnect\
  \ was apparent. Yulle offered to show her I.D. and was escorted up the stairs to\
  \ be \u201Clooked after\u201D. During this time, by some strange twist of fate,\
  \ the two women, of two shades and two generations, discovered that Senhora Camila,\
  \  was the long lost care-taker of Yulle\u2019s husband.  Days later we witnessed\
  \ the reunion of adult Alberto and Senhora Camila, his \u201Cwhite grandmother\u201D\
  , and made ourselves surrogate tias (aunts) to Joselina.  We spent several slow\
  \ hours on that rusted terrace and were joyed be a part of this small unfolding\
  \ of history in this foreign land.  Time breaks distance barriers.\n\nVinales, Cuba.\
  \ 7 am political rally.  \n\n\u201CQuein eres?\u201D  The announcer shouts.  \u201C\
  YO SOY FIDEL!\u201D the crowd responds. When hearing this proclamation so emphatically\
  \ repeated, I imagined how this rally would have sounded at home in the states.\
  \  The thought of shouting  \u201CI am Trump!\u201D left a large pinching knot in\
  \ my stomach. The concept of basing my very prized western sense of personal identity\
  \ on an imperfectly human president made me cringe.  The world is changing."
