Text: "She loves me the most, said the boy with the whip. Sure, she does, I remember\
  \ thinking. The boy has the shortest, messiest hair of all 14 guides. He was wearing\
  \ a pair of slippers at least 2 sizes bigger than he should. The wind carried the\
  \ smell of dried grass, old fruit, and wet earth whenever he edges closer. His eyes\
  \ were bright with curiosity and a little bit of fire - a good look for any boy\
  \ anywhere.  I thought once, twice or maybe a hundred times in that 10 minutes.\
  \ There was no queue, no lines. I was the only tourist in sight. I could go anywhere.\
  \ Do anything on my birthday.  Maybe I can change my mind and opt to pick strawberries\
  \ at any family farm in Berastagi? It's cheaper, less hassle, and no one would know\
  \ about my biggest secret.\n\nBut I chose this.\n\nThe first time I saw a horse\
  \ was when I was around 4 or 5. We had a neighbor with a small stable full of them.\
  \ Can't really remember how many or the colors but the movement always mesmerized\
  \ me. The horses were always trotting and running and just chilling out in the fields.\
  \ So wild and free. What a wonderful idea to consider - to be wild and free! We\
  \ were allowed to gawk but never ride. Then they moved and I never saw them again.\
  \ I saw horses from time to time and it still fills me with awe. At the jetty to\
  \ Langkawi near my house. In the city plaza at Amsterdam. Within the walls on Intramuros\
  \ and Rizal Park. I admire people who had the guts to ride it. When I pass them\
  \ by I can only imagine feeling so exposed, so naked and so, so alarmingly beautiful\
  \ that I don't think I can do it.\n\nObviously, I'm nothing of the sort.\n\nBut\
  \ the boy with the whip said it's the easiest, most relaxing thing to do. And I\
  \ think to myself that maybe I can do it. At least once in my lifetime. Ride a horse.\
  \ See the world from a different point of view. Just pick a horse and mount, right?\
  \ No big deal. There are several horses but the boy with the whip has a favourite\
  \ one - a pregnant mare. Molek is a good girl but she hates strange noises. We might\
  \ need to flee from lorries and busses, he warned.\n\nWe were going to climb up\
  \ Puncak Gundaling, a small hill located between 2 volcanoes. It should have been\
  \ a big deal for me as this is my first sighting of such thing I've only read in\
  \ my geography textbooks. It was an exceptionally sunny day with plenty of thin\
  \ white clouds. I should be seeing terrains of beautiful orchards, farms and vegetable\
  \ plots on either side of the hill but all I was praying for was to not have any\
  \ cars honking at us or Molek will turn berserk, or what happens if the saddle slips\
  \ away or if the ropes fall apart halfway and what if anyone could see the torn\
  \ on my leggings. I was terrified at every level on every second. I forgot about\
  \ the perfect weather and the little cold breeze in my hair. At the back of my mind,\
  \ I recalled a trip with my friends to Cameron Highlands several years back. A weekend\
  \ out in the city. That was the last time I spoke to both of them.\n\nA honk!\n\n\
  My nightmare was about to start. The boy with the whip was the first to react but\
  \ his slippers decided to break apart at that exact second. I was so helpless and\
  \ will probably die.\n\nThis is it. This is how it ends. On my birthday, to say\
  \ the least. Maybe I deserved it. This would have not happened if only I'd just\
  \ stayed at my cubicle and completed my night shift that week. Just stay down and\
  \ stay normal for once. No overseas trip for a stupid birthday tradition. For what?\
  \ To get trampled by a spooked horse? \n\nBut I pulled the rein and survived. Like\
  \ Molek, I grew tired of apologizing for the wild in me."
