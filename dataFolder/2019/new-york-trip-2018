Text: "My trip to New York last summer was one of the most satisfying, exhilarating\
  \ trip I had experienced in a long time. On our first day, we witnessed the amazing\
  \ sunset on the Manhattan skyline from the Jersey City. A group of people were practicing\
  \ yoga. It was a sight to watch with the soothing music and the beautiful waterfront\
  \ in the backdrop. The next morning, we explored the neighborhood of SoHo in Manhattan.\
  \ There was a vast number of boutiques, restaurants and cafes, and people were selling\
  \ drawings, sculptures, jewelry, clothing. For fashion and art buffs like myself,\
  \ SoHo was literally the place to explore. In the obscure streets, cobblestone pathways,\
  \ between the high brick buildings with cast iron fire escapes reminded of the retro\
  \ period. As we were passing by Washington Square Park, there were lot of local\
  \ vendors selling ice cream. An unusually small-sized man painted in white was posing\
  \ before the arch. His detailed presentation was quite impressive\u2013 the stony\
  \ texture of his skin, weathered look and his head covered with an off white head\
  \ scarf. We stopped at a nice Chinese restaurant for lunch. We ordered Biang Noodle\
  \ Soup and lamb dumplings. Our noodles came in a bowl with a variety of meat like\
  \ pork, lamb and beef. It had the fiery red color, but the spices were well balanced.\
  \ The noodles were chewy and the broth was so amazing. After a nice lunch, we quietly\
  \ walked around the south memorial pool to the oculus. We were still back in India\
  \ at the time of the 9/11 attack. Watching that horrific news on TV, I never felt\
  \ the magnitude and the despair of those families who just lost their loved ones.\
  \ The fountain is so simple yet powerful in a way that gives us hope. The oculus\
  \ was so beautiful, and had a unique design spoke of promise and lightness. It was\
  \ around dusk when we got on the ferry. The sky was colored in crimson gold as the\
  \ sun was shining past the liberty statue. The next day after morning mass, we went\
  \ down to East Williamsburg to have brunch in quaint, cozy cafe. The pancakes were\
  \ made from scratch and fueled us with enough energy for the day. On our way to\
  \ Brooklyn Bridge, we passed by a Jewish Community. There were buses and schools\
  \ specifically for Jews. The women were very modest and wore black clothing. There\
  \ were men dressed in black and with long sideburns walking down the street. As\
  \ we came by the Brooklyn Bridge, we passed a bazaar underneath the Manhattan Bridge\u2019\
  s archway. It had everything from modern antiques, vintage clothing to food from\
  \ around the world. When we got to the bridge, I was very surprised at how narrow\
  \ the pedestrian walkway was on the bridge. We arrived at Chinatown around evening\
  \ and red lantern balls were lightened up everywhere. The dense crowds in the street\
  \ did make me feel a little overwhelmed, but I really enjoyed the vibe. We stopped\
  \ at a shop where they were making rolled ice cream. Even through this traditional\
  \ Thai ice cream has been making waves in Instagram, it was my first time seeing\
  \ them make it. For anyone who visits Chinatown, there is something her for everyone\
  \ who comes here to enjoy a little piece of China in NYC. This trip was really worth\
  \ remembering and gave us a chance to look into a city that breathes its own history\
  \ and culture. I can\u2019t get over the long mile walks and riding the subway.\
  \ It was a different way of traveling and to explore this phenomenal city. In the\
  \ midst of the big skyscrapers and buildings, you feel small in this big world.\
  \ I often wonder why people move to this city. It can be overwhelming sometimes,\
  \ but it won\u2019t be any adventures living somewhere you have no challenges. It\
  \ forces you to think faster and be wiser. Back then, I despised living in New York\
  \ mainly because of the crowd, isolation and the small apartment, but there is a\
  \ beauty behind all of that. In any corner of the city, you will come upon many\
  \ people working in streets, restaurants, cafes and shops to make a living. Everyone\
  \ has a different style and personality and no one is judging each other. I think\
  \ if I move to the city in the future, it will make me more resilient and grow into\
  \ a stronger woman."
