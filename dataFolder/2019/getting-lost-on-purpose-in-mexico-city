Text: "When I headed over to Mexico City on my own , I wanted to immerse myself in\
  \ my wonderful country I had never discovered. \n\nWith awe and wonder I decided\
  \ to head out of the airport and into downtown , not caring for the complexity and\
  \ challenges of this old city.\n\nI set off to wonder, no particular destination\
  \ and no other idea than exploration.\n\nTo see the detail and to have my total\
  \ attention on the history and architecture of all downtown.\n\nGetting lost was\
  \ part of the adventure, it is where the city that takes you on a adventure , not\
  \ knowing what you might find or where you might end up.\n\nI wondered threw downtown\
  \ just asking places to stay and where I could go eat , getting to know the nicest\
  \ people I could ever meet , not knowing I was already loving and discovering the\
  \ heart of my country .\n\nLittle white and pink cars honked horns and asked where\
  \ you are going , people selling grasshoppers and peanuts in the street handing\
  \ you small bags for you to buy them.\n\nGoing threw small alleys between the old\
  \ neoclassic homes , I could see the lights of a little street market , walking\
  \ a little fast I made it , not knowing I was in a Chinese town . \n\nI found out\
  \ that I could get in a bus and go to a real near Spanish inspired old town so I\
  \ hopped in and talked to some locals on my way.\n\nAfter a long week in the city\
  \ and walking around and just figuring out how to move from place to place I ended\
  \ un with a group of Turkish tourist that I hanged along with the rest of my trip."
