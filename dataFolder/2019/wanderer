Text: "While I am sitting on sofa and imagining my trip to Egypt a vivid image of\
  \ my travel experience to this country popped up in my mind.\nA destination most\
  \ unlikely of my kind but a must visit place where one can experience the oldest\
  \ times of history. A land filled with religion, architecture of its own time, and\
  \ spiritual richness.\nBy now I have described my impression over this holy land.\
  \ I was drawn away by fashion icon,attitude and passion of cleopatra, which made\
  \ me travel to this country. This women was one of the strongest women in history\
  \ who had great business skills, use to speak six languages, knew philosophy and\
  \ Greek art. All this with an extremely feminine attitude and always adored with\
  \ gold in her hair, neck and wrists.\nI chose to start my journey in this land by\
  \ staying in Cairo, the capital of Egypt, one of the largest cities in Africa and\
  \ the eighth largest in the world. Of course, I wanted to master this land and not\
  \ to miss a single thing that happens there. \nCairo is surrounded by many important\
  \ places to see and visit. On one side, we have river nile, while in southwest,\
  \ we find one of the seven wonders of world the pyramids of Giza and Memphis ancient\
  \ necropolis, with the plateau of Giza. Visual beauty, architectural and history\
  \ existed abundance in that country.\nThe luxury nest I chose to stay in Cairo was\
  \ Marriot Mena House. The reason is obvious,\nthe unique and exclusive treatment\
  \ and of course, the hotels interior design which was simply stunning. They have\
  \ paid attention to every small details, like placing flowers in the bed corners\
  \ and views of pyramid from my balcony was really marvelous. Quickly, I wore my\
  \ shoes and took a walk near the pyramids and started to discover history of ancient\
  \ pharaohs.\nNext day, to add on more knowledge I visited Cairo museum. It is one\
  \ of the most important course in Egypt but believe me, fame is not what makes it\
  \ more interesting. Strong and rich secret of ancient world are embedded here and\
  \ we feel the reality of historic world. And of course the ancient and famous treasure\
  \ of pharaoh makes it worth a visit. We leave this museum with a different and more\
  \ experienced knowledge of what is true Islamic art and culture.\nOne of the amazing\
  \ experience was visiting The Khan E Khali Bazaar, which had range of shops and\
  \ stalls I have never seen before. I bought lots of spices from this market to enhance\
  \ more on my cooking skills. This market was very cheap and bargaining was also\
  \ possible.  \nMost mesmerizing experience of this country was sunset down on the\
  \ Esfinge which is one of the most picturesque places in the world, I have ever\
  \ been to. The most funniest part was sitting on the bumps of camel to take ride\
  \ across the pyramids. I had to admit that I had no patience for that and had to\
  \ stop.\nThis was my rolar coaster ride to journey in Egypt where I have gone through\
  \ Egyptian culture and historical lightness, which I still recall as the gentle\
  \ wind with fragrance of soft Lilly."
