Text: "My trip started in Rome, a city where you can walk on cobblestones that were\
  \ placed thousands of years ago to get to a modern gallery or commercial street.\
  \ The best memory I have from Rome is walking through Via del Corso street and seeing\
  \ that white, bright, huge monument at the end of the road, rising imposingly, which\
  \ I finally discovered was the Altar of the Fatherland. When I went up the stairs,\
  \ I looked up and saw an amazing horse made of iron, with a statue of Vittorio Emanuele\
  \ II on it. It really made me feel so small and insignificant. Another thing that\
  \ shocked me was the view of the Colosseo just 20 meters away from the subway station.\
  \ I remember crossing the doors of the station and, little by little, watching the\
  \ big stones and arcs appearing to form the wonderful picture of the ancient building.\
  \ I also went to Plaza de Espa\xF1a, which has a beautiful fount with the shape\
  \ of a boat; to the Pante\xF3n, which is the place where Vittorio Emanuele's body\
  \ rests, and to the Vatican, a must see no matter what your religion is. There were\
  \ thousands of interesting places to see in Rome, and if you go, you need to stay\
  \ at least five days to admire every detail. It's definitely the Eternal City, as\
  \ people say.\n\nMy next stop was Florence, where I got to by train. What I didn\xB4\
  t expect to find was that the train would go through enormous sunflower fields,\
  \ full of thousands of shiny yellow spots along both sides of the train. I had never\
  \ seen something like that before, as I come from a little island in the Atlantic\
  \ Ocean, and it was quite fascinating. Once I got to the city, I got lost in those\
  \ old narrow streets, watching the golden top of the Santa Mar\xEDa del Fiore Cathedral\
  \ from every corner I stopped in.  In one of those corners there was a small gelateria,\
  \ so I got in and I have to say that the raspberry ice cream I ate was the best\
  \ I've ever had in my whole life. After that, I went to Ponte Vecchio, a medieval\
  \ bridge full of shops of all kinds, over the Arno River. Once I crossed the bridge,\
  \ I walked along the river, observing the people that were dining in the stone balconies\
  \ decorated with colorful flowers and candles. \n\nAfter Florence, I went to Bologna,\
  \ a small city perfect for young people, as it has one of the best (and oldest)\
  \ universities in Europe, where many students go to study abroad and enjoy the cultural\
  \ diversity it has.  A fun fact about Bologna is that it has its own leaning tower,\
  \ like the tower of Pisa (but more modest). However, I didn\xB4t spend much time\
  \ there, but The ice cream there was also delicious, and of course I had to taste\
  \ their lasagna and spaguetti al ragu bolognese, it's a must there!\n\nFinally,\
  \ my trip ended in the modern city of Milan. Milan is like a completely different\
  \ world. From the moment I arrived at the train station and saw those incredible\
  \ ceilings and walls I knew it would be over the top. You could feel the glamour\
  \ in the air, the shops had two or three bodyguards to keep the expensive products\
  \ safe, and the restaurants were so classy and elegant. I went through the gallery\
  \ of Vittorio Emanuele from end to end, entering all its stores, imagining how would\
  \ it be if I had enough money to buy anything more than just a small keyring or\
  \ a little piece of chocolate. My last memory of Milan is entering to the Duomo\
  \ subway station and turning my head around to admire the gigantic Duomo Cathedral\
  \ receiving the last rays of sun, knowing that I would definitely come back to Italy\
  \ some day (I threw a coin into the Fontana di Trevi, so it has to be true!)."
