Text: "After a breaking up with my girlfriend and having a time off from my family\
  \ I took the risk and sold out my car and took all my money saved for 4 years and\
  \ invested in a trip to Canada to study English without speaking even Good morning!\
  \ \nI had so many embarressing funny moments that could not fit in here.\nI studied\
  \ hard for 8 hours a day and got know many people good and bad ones I was only 23\
  \ by the time but felt like a baby sometimes. \nI lived in Toronto for 2 years but\
  \ got know Montreal, Ottawa, Quebec, Naiagara Falls and other cities around.\nHad\
  \ many parties, bars and also later met Jesus, who changed my life bringing peace\
  \ in my heart.\nThis trip helped me to grow up and feel like a growing up man inside.\
  \ I suffered a lots, but I also enjoyed my staying there! \nToday I am an English\
  \ Teacher, married to another English teacher. I have my own house,  and got know\
  \ other countries like Australia, too. All this due to my studies in Canada and\
  \ of course the gutts to throw everything away and bet on something unknown as it\
  \ was my first time abroad ever!"
