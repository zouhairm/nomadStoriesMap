Text: "I don\u2019t remember his name. \n\nTo me, he will always be \u2018thatha\u2019\
  \ \u2013 \u2018grandpa\u2019 in Tamil, my maternal tongue. My thatha from Costa\
  \ Rica. \n\n\u201CAre you Pranasth?\u201D his loud voice queries, butchering my\
  \ name and the precious silence blanketing the sleepy San Jose Avenida at sunrise.\
  \ \n\n\u201CYes! Prashanth\u201D, heavy-eyed, irritated and offering a correction,\
  \ I look up at the owner of the voice. Shock replaces my somnolence, for standing\
  \ at the door of the \nnondescript shuttle bus was a spitting image of my deceased\
  \ grandfather \u2013 our tour guide for the day. My brother, Prabhu, nudges me bewildered.\
  \ He sees it too. \n\nGrandpa passed away when I was in my early teens, having lived\
  \ with us in Chennai for the entirety of my childhood. I wasn\u2019t told of his\
  \ passing until after the urgent funeral for fear that I would go into a speechless\
  \ state of shock for weeks. I had a history. I still remember him alive, sprightly,\
  \ leaning on his walking stick and with a smile, the biggest of which he reserved\
  \ for his weekly dose of Coca Cola I brought from the neighborhood store. Grandpa\u2019\
  s boy, I was. \n\nNow in the capital city of Costa Rica, the memories come flooding\
  \ back. I jump into the seat right behind thatha, barely noting the other tourists\
  \ packed in the bus. As we navigate the perfect grid of empty streets and numberless\
  \ houses towards the Pan American highway, my eyes are glued to the man speaking\
  \ into his microphone. \n\nFor what must seem like the millionth time, he goes through\
  \ his opening routine \u2013 \u201CWhere is everyone from?\u201D, \u201CWe have\
  \ best coffee in the world\u201D, \u201CIf you don\u2019t come back in time, you\
  \ hitchhike your way back\u201D. The crowd chuckles. I smile at the way he taps\
  \ his fingers when he speaks. Just like grandpa. \u201CShould we show him a picture?\u201D\
  , I ask Prabhu. \n\nThe bus makes its way through Alajuela. \u201CThat\u2019s a\
  \ statue of Juan Santamaria, except it\u2019s not him\u201D. Some story about a\
  \ mistaken statue of their national hero. My mind harps back to stories of grandpa\
  \ selling rare statues. \n\nWe arrive at our first stop \u2013 a coffee plantation.\
  \ As the gaggle of tourists follow the plantation guide, I light up a cigarette\
  \ and follow thatha. \u201CDoes the job get repetitive?\u201D, I ask. \u201CSame\
  \ things. Different people. I like people. They tip me well\u201D. He talks so fast.\
  \ Just like grandpa. \u201CAm I just seeing things? Does the smell of coffee trigger\
  \ good memories?\u201D, I whisper to Prabhu. \n\nIt\u2019s midday now and we are\
  \ basking in sunshine, huddled around thatha. The emerald green of the Poas Volcano\
  \ crater gleams as my nostrils, spoiled by the aroma of coffee, acclimatize to Sulphur.\
  \ \u201CYou all are very lucky. No clouds. My first 8 times, I saw no crater\u201D\
  . We sneak in a selfie with thatha. \u201CWe don\u2019t have a picture together\
  \ with grandpa\u201D, Prabhu notes. \n\nOur final destination is the La Paz waterfall\
  \ gardens. We feast on a delectable buffet surrounded by lush greenery. Fed and\
  \ content, I wade through the crowd to find him admiring the rescued spider monkeys.\
  \ \u201CIn Chennai, you see monkeys everywhere. My grandpa loved them\u201D, I recounted.\
  \ Thatha listens with interest. \n\nWe walk along forest trails dotted by butterfly\
  \ gardens, animal sanctuaries and crystal-clear waterfalls. This is Costa Rica.\
  \ This is Pura Vida. The hike is strenuous but thatha is ahead of the pack walking\
  \ briskly, belying his age. I remember grandpa walking fast, even at 90. \n\n\u201C\
  Daylight come and me wan\u2019 go home\u201D, Harry Belafonte croons softly from\
  \ the speakers as we drive back through a dreamy cloud forest. The fog outside is\
  \ as heavy as my eyes. I also want to go home. To Chennai. \n\nI wake up startled\
  \ by the harsh sounds of San Jose. Our drop off point. \u201CYou look just like\
  \ my grandpa\u201D, I finally confess. Thatha smiles as I hand him his tip. \u201C\
  I like you. You tip well. Safe trip back to USA\u201D. Horns blare impatiently as\
  \ we exit the bus in a flash. Talk about anti-climactic. \n\nIn the chaotic street,\
  \ I notice the unopened Coca Cola bottle in my hand. I never gave it to him."
