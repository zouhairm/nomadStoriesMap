Text: "I jog impatiently on the spot, right foot to left foot, left foot to right\
  \ foot, as I wait in the line behind a slow-moving pack of holiday-makers and honey-mooners.\
  \ They take their time to finger and try on the fluorescent mask and snorkel sets,\
  \ and block the stairway that descends into the beckoning stretch of turquoise Aitutaki\
  \ lagoon that our boat is currently moored in. My own lime-green snorkel twirls\
  \ in my hand as I stare at the sea hungrily. Only yesterday I had bought the snorkel\
  \ set and had spent over half an hour trying it on and trying to adjust it to avoid\
  \ fogging up, without much success. Despite living near a gigantic body of water\
  \ for most of my life, I had never once tried snorkelling. Never braved the piercing\
  \ blue depths of my hometown lake to spy on the trout and smelt that called it home.\
  \ My first-time snorkelling was originally intended to be in the rocky beach nearby\
  \ to my hotel in Rarotonga, but after hearing the rumours of a nearby island with\
  \ a lagoon so beautiful that it qualified for the title of \u201CParadise on Earth\u201D\
  \ I knew I needed to book myself on a flight and a lagoon cruise there ASAP. When\
  \ I had once been nervous, I was now hot-footing it to the ladder at the side of\
  \ the boat to get a glimpse of the marvellous underwater world that Aitutaki hosts.\
  \ After navigating my way through a limited gap between the crowd, I got to the\
  \ ladder and stepped into the water. Where once I had been usually accustomed to\
  \ a shock of cold, I got a warm and silky embrace. Where once my feet had scraped\
  \ coarse sand or navigated its way around rocks, they instead tread upon fine white\
  \ sand. Where once my unprotected eyes were used to seeing the murky flick and swish\
  \ of a solitary trout retreating out of sight, I now slip on my lime-green mask\
  \ and submerge myself like a submarine beneath the surface of the lagoon and see\
  \ a hum of activity swirling all around me. Floating lazily beyond my reach is a\
  \ brightly-coloured parrotfish, its plumage a mass of ice-blue and raspberry-pink\
  \ scales, and its beak snaps harmlessly at me. Around my face swirls an enchanting\
  \ mass of yellow, black and white striped butterfly fish, which flutter and dance\
  \ around me with each turn of my head and wave of a hand. Beyond, I see the majority\
  \ of snorkellers hovering over a giant object sunken on the lagoon floor. When I\
  \ am closer, I can see it is the monolithic frame of a giant clam, its gigantic\
  \ lips pursed shut, hiding its secrets. I remember what the guide had said above\
  \ the hum of conversation in the boat; if we waited long enough, eventually the\
  \ clam would crank itself open to reveal what was inside. I was intrigued, so I\
  \ remained floating above the clam, and continued to marvel at the astonishing array\
  \ or iridescent fish and coral that seemed to make the clam the centre of their\
  \ thriving town. From the corner of my eye I detected a hint of movement from the\
  \ clam, and despite being underwater, the mutual sense of wonder between all the\
  \ snorkellers was tangible when the clam finally gave up her secret. The lips of\
  \ the clam unclamped to reveal a gorgeous carpet of deepest indigo with an incredible\
  \ pattern of speckles and squiggles of black. But before we knew it the clam had\
  \ rewound its mechanism, so it was back to an impressive, although seemingly lifeless\
  \ shell. As everyone drifted their way idly back to the boat, I kept my eye upon\
  \ the expanse of water that remained tinted by the aqua filter and the sunlight\
  \ that streamed through, until the floor of the lagoon sloped away, giving into\
  \ the serene, yet seemingly impenetrable royal blue where the barriers of safety\
  \ guarded us no more. I had seen the shell and had swam the shallows, the next time\
  \ I would take the plunge and dive the indigo carpet of the sublime deep of the\
  \ ocean."
