Text: "It\u2019s nearly 500,000 degrees Celcius and I\u2019m stuck in a shuttle van\
  \ on a dusty road outside some hostel seemingly in the middle of Nowhere, Nicaragua.\
  \ Waiting. I\u2019ve just spent the entire day trying to get my bank cards to work\
  \ at a remote ATM--eventually having to Paypal a fellow traveller in exchange for\
  \ cash for the next leg of my journey--only to now find myself stuck in this stationary\
  \ sweatmobile. The driver doesn\u2019t speak much English and my Spanish isn\u2019\
  t great, so I have no idea why we\u2019ve been waiting so long.\n\nFinally a group\
  \ of people comes running up. They throw their bags on top the van and climb inside.\
  \ I roll my eyes as one of the girls sprightly greets everyone in the shuttle.\n\
  \nWe get moving and I sink down in my seat. As we leave the beautiful ocean views\
  \ of Popoyo, all I can think about is whether or not my bank cards will work where\
  \ I\u2019m headed next, otherwise I\u2019ll be strapped for the rest of my trip.\n\
  \nThe shuttle drops us at the ferry in San Jorge and I scurry to be alone. It\u2019\
  s a bumpy ferry ride to Ometepe and I\u2019m 9/10 on the nausea scale. As locals\
  \ laugh at the Telenovela playing on board, I overhear the group from the shuttle\
  \ talking about Toronto. I roll my eyes again. I\u2019m from Toronto. I decide these\
  \ are the kind of people from Toronto I don\u2019t like.  \n\nWe arrive on the island\
  \ and I scurry to get a taxi to my hotel. I head to the south tip of the island\
  \ where I soon discover I am La Punta Hotel\u2019s only guest--other than the macaw,\
  \ Pedro. The riots have been going strong in the country\u2019s major cities, and\
  \ this has caused many travellers to flee home. Perspective. This helps me cool\
  \ off my frustrated energy. That, and the sunset view from here is remarkable.\n\
  \nThe next morning I\u2019m fed oreos and fruit by the hotel owner--the cook didn\u2019\
  t come in because of the riots. A morning trek to the bank brings me much relief:\
  \ my cards work here. Not wanting to be alone, I decide to head to a chocolate hostel\
  \ called El Pital for the next few days. \n\nThe final road to El Pital is too rocky\
  \ for my taxi so he drops me at the top of a hill. As I journey down the windy gravel\
  \ road, I worry this place won\u2019t be for me. I\u2019m a city hippy, but here\
  \ are like, hippy hippies. I set up my bunk and start exploring the place, only\
  \ to stumble into one of the folks I\u2019d avoided from the shuttle. My heart sinks.\
  \ I\u2019m so embarrassed for being such a scroogey traveller. I immediately introduce\
  \ myself, crack a few jokes about how my temporary misfortune made me grumpy, and\
  \ I\u2019m warmly greeted by his group.\n\nTurns out there\u2019s a cacao ceremony\
  \ that night and a few of them are taking part. I came to the chocolate hostel for\
  \ the chocolate so I dive right in. \n\nNestled under a mango tree, we\u2019re gathered\
  \ on the yoga deck as the sun makes its last descent. Our guide, Brooke, navigates\
  \ us through the benefits of cacao and why the Mayans believed it to possess magical\
  \ power. The full Scorpio moon gazes upon us as a scorpion voluntarily makes its\
  \ way into the cacao pot. Really.\n\nBrooke pours the rich, thick, scorpion-blessed\
  \ chocolate into individual cups and asks us to honor each cup one by one as we\
  \ pass them around our seated circle. When we get to sipping the cacao, it\u2019\
  s truly the best tasting chocolate I have ever had. I can feel my hesitation about\
  \ this place, about the ceremony--about everything--falling away.\n\nShe guides\
  \ us through a meditation and I pass right out. When she brings us back I am buzzing.\
  \ I mean my arms and legs and everything is all buzzing; I feel light and alive.\
  \ I can\u2019t believe the shift I\u2019ve gone through in 24 hours and I\u2019\
  m so grateful for these new lifelong friends.\n\nWe danced and laughed the rest\
  \ of the night--high on chocolate and hearts full as the moon."
