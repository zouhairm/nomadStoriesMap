Text: "As a curious soul that I am, I have always been curious about a lot of things.\
  \ Specially when you grow up been the baby of the family of five sisters. My mother\
  \ is a worry womb. I believe we take such much from our parents as kids.\nAs an\
  \ island girl and an immigrant living in NY, I have tried to break that partner\
  \ and to take risks in life, explore new things/places and have curiosity for more\
  \ than What I have in front of me.\_\n\nI am a traveler at heart. So back in 2014,\
  \ my adventures began and I started doing the things I love and I\u2019m passionate\
  \ about; to travel as much as I can. This time around was a bit different coming\
  \ from me. What? That you are traveling all the way across the sea? Europe? ...,\
  \ and by yourself? Yes I am and did.\nAnd let me tell you, it was indeed a leap\
  \ into the Unknown even though I knew a lot about the culture, people and country\
  \ from my French classes, movies and books.\n\nThe day finally came and I\u2019\
  m not going to lie it was a bit scary but I did it and don\u2019t regret it at all.\
  \ It was a dream come true and a lifetime experience I will never forget in my life.\
  \ It was so dreamy and I couldn\u2019t even believe I did it all by my own. I do\
  \ believe theirs a time for everything and it was simply the perfect time for me.\
  \ I finally went to Europe and to my forever favorite Paris. Wow\u2026 I thought\
  \ to my self dreams do come true and if you want something in life the universe\
  \ will make it happen some way or another. I loved my experience there and it was\
  \ everything and more I ever imagined. Life is about taking risks and I have taken\
  \ some and love the person I am becoming because I know there\u2019s more and the\
  \ unknown is what I have always kind of knew and  what I want to be more of my known.\
  \ My curiosity to see the world has encouraged me to take a leap into the Unknown\
  \ and I just can\u2019t wait for it all.\_\n\nWe all know traveling and embarking\
  \ in a new adventure is a challenge and more if you are traveling on your own because\
  \ you don\u2019t depend on anyone but yourself; a great way to get out of your comfort\
  \ zone and just go see the world. Let\u2019s be honest we can\u2019t be waiting\
  \ for anyone to do things or the perfect moment because real life is not that way.\
  \ Follow your dreams and never look back."
