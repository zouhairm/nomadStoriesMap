Text: "The film tells the true story of a girl who works as a journalist. Originally\
  \ from Aswan in Upper Egypt, she does not like this place praised by many others.\
  \ \nShe has personal reasons for this: her father divorced her mother, so the mother\
  \ left Aswan with her daughter to live in Cairo. Also, our protagonist was subdued\
  \ to tribal customs in Aswan before moving to Cairo including genital mutilation.\n\
  The girl tells all this in a letter that has been sent to an unknown person in the\
  \ beginning. Over the course of the film though, we find out about the person's\
  \ identity. \nIt is a journey from Aswan to Cairo, but also a personal journey to\
  \ become a journalist - along which she encounters many issues such as conservatism\
  \ and cultural intolerance. \nIn this respect, she also dialogues with Magda Haroun,\
  \ the head of the Jewish community in Egypt. In a rare if not unique moment, we\
  \ film inside the Jewish temple and its library in Cairo. High security measures\
  \ surround the temple, shooting is usually forbidden, as Egypt and Israel keep on\
  \ fighting over the temple. \nOur protagonist also witnesses the deterioration of\
  \ other Egyptian cities such as Aswan, Port Said, or Cairo along her way. \nIt's\
  \ a journey of an Egyptian girl who has a lot of pain and suffering inside herself\
  \ and inside her country Egypt, but she still has hope. Hope for change.\n\n\n\n\
