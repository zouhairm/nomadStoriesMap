Text: "October 2017. Sitting in the Transiberian train on my way to Novosibirsk city\
  \ which is going to be my first stop before next one in Sludjanka, the town on the\
  \ shore of the Baikal lake. I hoped l will find there, in Novosibirsk little pieces\
  \ or at least directions while building my reportage about native people of Siberia\
  \ better or just to understand it more. \n(...) \nGreen grass and tall birches growing\
  \ all around rail trails. Large cities and massive concrete. I was overwhelmed.\
  \ Russia is definitely greater than I thought about it back then in the school.\
  \ I accepted very early on that l just started my journey and cannot condition it\u2019\
  s success by amount of final informations. \u201CYou are in completely new territory\
  \ trying to communicate with your broken Russian so accept that everything has its\
  \ own time\u201D words that Alfonso,  fellow soul l\u2019ve met in Novosibirsk,\
  \ would repeat to me while describing his story. \nWe\u2019ve met in the Museum\
  \ of Archeology and Ethnology of Siberia which is located on the Zolotodolinskeho\
  \ street 4. l\u2019ve got the address written on white little paper both in the\
  \ Cyrillic and Latin alphabet by the receptionist siting in the entrance of the\
  \ university building. She was wearing white apron reminding me typical school's\
  \ movie scenes from the Soviet era I would never really understand watching as a\
  \ kid born in newly formed democratic Czechoslovakia. Lady at the reception seemed\
  \ to be bored but that would change immediately after you would build a first eye\
  \ contact with her. Despite her clear advices what direction to take I couldn't\
  \ find the address (as many times in Russia). Girl her early twenties whom I asked\
  \ for a direction called someone to ask where the Museum is while standing just\
  \ few steps from it. \n(...)\nl was going out from the first room of the exhibition\
  \ when l\u2019ve met Alfonso in the hallway standing around bunch of young pupils\
  \ and their teacher. This made me ask if any of them speak English. \n(...) \nAlfonso\
  \ is researcher from Madrid coming from Kamchatka and hoping to go to the North,\
  \ to the Nenets telling me at the time we\u2019ve met. He was born to Spanish parents\
  \ in Sahara desert where they lived until he was 7 years old. He believes this environmet\
  \ thought him to be patience. Even the way we walked for a coffee later that evening\
  \ was so calm (so appreciated by me cause of stress and so). He would show me pictures\
  \ from Kamchatka and Mongolia while sipping not very tasty coffee. Talking about\
  \ freedom, solitude and the book he is working on. All with beautiful flow of inner\
  \ peace. Then we went to the sport shop to buy me headlamp in case l will follow\
  \ his suggestion to step out from the train in the certain point on Baikal during\
  \ the night.\n(...) \nHe was on his way to the north and me to the Baikal. I heard\
  \ from him a week later sending me message the day he would arrive to the North\
  \ and writing: \u201CLoneliness and cold is the recipe of this land\u201D."
