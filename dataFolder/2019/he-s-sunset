Text: Traveling words that are interesting in the ear and interesting also for the
  road. I like traveling when I was in junior high school. the first place I was traveling
  in my father's hometown, when I first went there in my mind the village must be
  ugly there were no tall buildings and also the food was not as good as in the city.
  long story short I arrived at my father's hometown at the beginning I stepped on
  my feet there I was stunned by the beautiful expanse of flowers on the side of the
  road and also the high mountains that made my father's hometown very cold and the
  water so clear, cold and refreshing in the throat when drinking. After a few days
  there I became more open and adapted to the people there studying their culture,
  eating them which made me want to eat continuously because they were so delicious
  to eat that at first I thought that I would not eat as good as in the city. I became
  interested in the passage of time, I explored the places in my father's hometown,
  and I was so fascinated and caught my attention there was a lake that was so clear
  and the water was beautiful blue and green to see and in even in the lake I could
  see a lot of fish and also shrimp and it turned out that the livelihoods of the
  locals from this lake and also gardening made them survive in this village. While
  I was there, I liked the hometown even more.
