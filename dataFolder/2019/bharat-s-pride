Text: "The calming melody played as we walked into the inordinately yet colorfully\
  \ decorated hall where the wedding was being held. In the Indian subcontinent, weddings\
  \ were a ridiculously extravagant affair, the celebrations lasting sometimes up\
  \ to a grand total of twenty-five days. I personally exercised a great amount of\
  \ vanity and pride in contemplative grace preparing myself for these festivities.\
  \ \n\nOf course, at every wedding, the person getting married was the sister of\
  \ the aunt of the friend of the coworker of your cousin, so it was not a concerning\
  \ factor that I did not personally know either of the people actually getting married\
  \ - like every other savvy teenager, I was only attending to take some pictures\
  \ for my social media and engage in the gluttonous act of filling my body with the\
  \ delicious food that was exclusive only to that particular region. \n\nAs I sauntered\
  \ past the many throngs of people, chunri dragging on the ground and earrings gently\
  \ tinkering to the sway of my walk, many different distant family members greeted\
  \ me with affectionate embraces and kisses that were embedded with the warmth of\
  \ home. Eventually the food was rolled in, and rice cooked in complex curries, twelve\
  \ kinds of condiments sprinkled with cinnamon, coriander and tumeric laden on gold\
  \ encrusted plates were brought to the tables by the army of waiters, all dressed\
  \ in traditional attire. \n\n\"We must express our joy and good wishes to the new\
  \ couple,\" my mother advised earnestly. I told her that we could approach the podium\
  \ as soon as I had finished my meal. \n\nIndia was an exceedingly diverse country\
  \ in an uncountable number of ways. Starting from the various languages and dialects,\
  \ to the clothing and the rich history laced with independence and self-sufficiency\
  \ to the complex geopolitical situation in the area. In my short trip, I had uncovered\
  \ that India was not all gulab jamuns and kheer, to say the least. There were secrets\
  \ and mysteries in every corner, lurking behind every abandoned fort and under every\
  \ gutter and behind every veil, if only one took the time to look behind the glamor\
  \ and the bedazzle. \n\nWith a full stomach, we waded through the sequins and the\
  \ glimmering satin cloth that was draped over like partitions. until at last we\
  \ reached the small little loveseat where the shy bride and her beaming husband\
  \ to be were perched. \n\nAnother cultural favorite that has been tradition since\
  \ the times of the grand Mughal dynasty, it was social mandate that the bride always\
  \ veil her face until the very last minutes of the ceremony where the marriage has\
  \ been cemented - lest some form of bad luck of envy try and steal her newlywed\
  \ glow. Flashes went off as the wedding photographers urged them to pose together.\
  \ \n\nThe groom was not particularly striking, though he was beaming and was dressed\
  \ sharply in a crisp punjabi of sheer teal with silver embroidery, and his rosy\
  \ cheeks suggested he was either embarrassed of the playful jabs about his petite\
  \ little wife to be or just a bit tipsy from the copious amounts of alcohol being\
  \ passed around in brass goblets. \n\n\n\"My darling, please take off your veil\
  \ so we may bless you,\" my mother urged, not exactly in an insistent way. A light,\
  \ childish giggle sounded from under the bundle of the sheer cloth as the bride\
  \ playfully threw it back to look at my mother and I. \n\nMy mouth fell open, eyes\
  \ as round as tennis balls. She was beautiful, yes - but under her blouse were barely\
  \ formed mounds, her cheeks bearing the indent of youth, her hips still not quite\
  \ full, her visage betraying a reflection of confusion and innocence. \n\nShe could\
  \ not have been more than nine years old. \n\nI could feel the rice and the curry\
  \ inside my body start to heave, begging for release, my organs constricted and\
  \ crushed inside my own body, my mind struggling to make sense of what I was seeing.\
  \ I had been told India was a country where such was normalized, that many men took\
  \ wives that were ten, twenty, even thirty years younger than themselves. Nobody\
  \ seemed to care. \n\nThe photographers kept clicking."
