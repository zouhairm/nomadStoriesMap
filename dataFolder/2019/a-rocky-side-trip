Text: "I had become my worst nightmare: American Coffee Guy. \n\nOn a high school\
  \ trip to Italy, one of the chaperones constantly asked for the beverage. Even as\
  \ a teenager, I knew Italian coffee was Michelangelo's David to America\u2019s macaroni\
  \ necklace. I swore to always appreciate local specialities and customs. \n\nHow\
  \ did I forget when I returned to Italy as an adult with my mom? I blame a faulty\
  \ Fiat. Between Siena and Venice, the gas pedal dropped from my foot like the engine\
  \ was trying to inhale it. I\u2019d learned Mario Andretti was the rule, not the\
  \ exception here, so I jerked the car to the side of the highway.\n\nWhen the rental\
  \ agency didn\u2019t answer their after hours line, we grumbled about Italy not\
  \ believing the customer is always right. We had the car towed and found a hotel\
  \ to wait for the garage to open in the morning. At eight, hours after my American\
  \ mechanic starts his days, we called a taxi.\n\n\u201CThey will not open for maybe\
  \ two hours,\u201D the cab driver told us. \n\nWhat kind of business has maybe hours?\n\
  \n\u201CLet me give you a tour of Modena,\u201D he offered.  \n\nHaving no other\
  \ options, we agreed. \u201CWhat\u2019s your town known for?\u201D I asked, feigning\
  \ interest.\n\nThe driver smiled under his Tom Selleck mustache. \u201CFerrari,\u201D\
  \ he said. His accent made it sound like a romantic song title.  \n\n\u201CSeriously?\u201D\
  \ \n\n\u201CSi. Also Lamborghini and Maserati.\u201D\n\nOur car quit in the home\
  \ of elite Italian auto manufacturing. The irony compounded our annoyance. This\
  \ delay cost us time and money. We had gondolas to ride and Murano glass to admire.\
  \ Our itinerary did not include anything unplanned, especially not a visit to the\
  \ Enzo Ferrari Museum. \n\n\u201CAnd your town is known for?\u201D \n\nNot all Europeans\
  \ know Philadelphia, other than as a cream cheese. Our driver, though, turned to\
  \ face us. \n\n\u201CYou know Rocky?\u201D he demanded.\n\nBefore I could answer,\
  \ he continued. \u201CI know everything about Rocky. I watch the movies, read the\
  \ books.\u201D My Philly cred plummeted. I didn\u2019t even know there were books.\
  \ He meant Stallone\u2019s memoir. \u201CWhat is the day you eat the chicken?\u201D\
  \n\nMy mom and I shook our heads. Luckily, it was November.\n\n\u201CYou mean turkey?\
  \ Thanksgiving?\u201D she asked.\n\n\u201CYes, it is a big holiday,\u201D he said.\
  \ We agreed, thinking of Pilgrims, Native Americans, and stuffing. \u201CIt is in\
  \ Rocky.\u201D\n\nHe alternated telling Balboa facts with pointing out landmarks.\
  \ We felt like celebrities by Rocky proxy.\nBegrudgingly, I noted Modena\u2019s\
  \ mix of Siena\u2019s ancient charm and Rome\u2019s cosmopolitan bustle. The driver\
  \ showed us where to buy the town\u2019s other main export, Aceto Balsamico di Modena.\
  \ We got enough to make our visit seem intentional. It might be the only instance\
  \ of vinegar shopping retail therapy. We still couldn\u2019t wait to return to our\
  \ schedule.\n\nWhen the garage opened, the driver came in to translate. He pointed\
  \ to the lone car in the lot. The employee nodded and returned to showing off her\
  \ new Gucci bag to her colleagues. They inspected the lining and stitching with\
  \ oohs and aahs of approval. We did not get as much attention as the new purse.\
  \ We got none.\n\nFirst, we waited patiently. Then, we asked the driver if he could\
  \ remind them we were customers.\n\n\u201CThis is Italy,\u201D he said, wagging\
  \ his finger. \u201CThings are different here. What\u2019s the rush?\u201D He took\
  \ his turn admiring the satchel. We did too, if incredulously. Its proud new owner\
  \ eventually summoned a mechanic who returned with a head shake. That needed no\
  \ translation. The rental agency said a replacement would take days. \n\n\u201C\
  Can you imagine this happening in America?\u201D I asked my mom.\n\nMy inner teen\
  \ cringed. A gracious local gave us an entertaining private tour of his hometown\
  \ and I asked for American coffee. I wanted to crawl into the Gucci bag and disappear.\n\
  \nWhen the driver dropped us at the train station, we thanked him in English, Italian,\
  \ and Euros. I try to remember him when things inevitably go awry when traveling.\
  \ Thankfully, I get a reminder every year when my family celebrates our new favorite\
  \ holiday, The Day You Eat the Chicken."
