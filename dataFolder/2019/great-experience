Text: "\u0130n March 2018, \u0130 made a trip to Nairobi Kenya . \u0130t was my Ever\
  \ first trip, it was so amazing an fantastic. Travelling from Cameroon to Nairobi\
  \ was a great experience , first \u0130 board Rwanda airlines which permitted me\
  \ to transit in Kigali Rwanda . There in Kigali though we didnt last long there\
  \ but i discovered so many things about the country an its inhabitans . They are\
  \ friendly , saw many of theirs creative works of act exhibited at the AirPort .\
  \ The country has a Beautiful topography , Beautiful landscape as we  flew  acros\
  \ . From Kigali which happens to be Rwanda's capital , we continued our journey\
  \ to Nairobi where we landed at the Jomokenyata \u0130nternational AirPort , very\
  \ large an Beautiful AirPort named after their former president Jomokenyata , while\
  \ there  we pass through all the  security  check points after which \u0130 bombed\
  \ into a lady who worked there at the AirPort , she offered to help take me to a\
  \ hotel since it was my first time in Nairobi . We arrived the hotel an \u0130 booked\
  \ in , \u0130 took the lady's number before she left. The hotel was cool , it had\
  \ all  varieties of Kenyan food , WiFi Network available which made it easier for\
  \ me to search useful information about Kenya , its people , culture an some of\
  \ the attractive touristic site Kenya has to offer.      After some few days in\
  \ Nairobi \u0130 became lonely an a bit bored so \u0130 decided to call that lady\
  \ who brought me to the hotel. \u0130 told her that am bored an its lonely here\
  \ at the hotel , immediately she offered to bring me to her house so that \u0130\
  \ could interact with the children an they will take me around the city.  \u0130\
  \ was so happy that \u0130 decided to live with them for the rest of my Stay that\
  \ \u0130 was in Kenya . Staying with them \u0130 learnt alot about Kenya culture,\
  \ \u0130 learn how to speak in swahili an \u0130 got adapted to their food. \u0130\
  \ felt in love with One of  their dishes call ugali. \u0130 learnt how to prepare\
  \ some of  their dishes. \u0130 enjoyed Living with them because we could go out\
  \ together , visited all the attractive sites in Nairobi , took many pictures, i\
  \ enjoyed drinking kenyan wine. After a few weeks in Nairobi , i an the children\
  \ decided to make a trip to mombassa the economic capital of Kenya . The trip was\
  \ so amazing , i discovered so many creative works there in mombassa an had to placed\
  \ an order to get some of them when returning back to Cameroon. We spent three days\
  \ in mombass before Living back to Nairobi. The family made me to enjoy my Stay\
  \ in Kenya , they took me as one of theirs , \u0130 became a son , brother to them.\
  \ \u0130 made a month in Kenya , on the day of my return \u0130 was offered a sendoff\
