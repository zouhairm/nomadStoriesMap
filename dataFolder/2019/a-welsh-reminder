Text: "Halfway between the back of a Welsh mountain pony and the mud of a Welsh mountain,\
  \ time stops. I am diagonal. I am falling. There is an intense pain in my mouth.\
  \ My teeth feel shattered. My nose broken. I am still falling. Welsh mountain ponies\
  \ are not tall \u2013 how am I still falling?\n\nI land with a thud and curl on\
  \ my side, clasping my hands to my face. The horse behind me spooks and his rider\
  \ struggles to keep from trampling me. I can hear the horses at the front of our\
  \ group stop at her screams.\n\nI have not fallen from a horse in over a decade.\
  \ When I was learning to ride, I slipped off my pony and the girth buckle opened\
  \ me up from ribcage to hipbone. Grandma, a nurse before she married and raised\
  \ eight kids on a farm, lay me down on the front porch to treat the gaping wound.\
  \ The magpies warbled as she worked.\n\nHere on the ground with my hands sticky\
  \ with blood, I am suddenly and violently homesick. I have been since moving to\
  \ London three months ago, but I\u2019ve swallowed and swallowed until the feeling\
  \ was banished to the bottom of my stomach. I thought maybe the lush green of the\
  \ Brecon Beacons would act as a surrogate for the wide brown stretches of central\
  \ west New South Wales, so I booked a train out of London. Though the air here tastes\
  \ like nothing and life moves at a familiar, deliciously slow pace, the knot in\
  \ my stomach still twists.  \n\nFootsteps rush to me. A shadow passes over my face.\
  \ \n\n\u201CDid you hit the branch?\u201D\n\n\u201CYes.\u201D\n\n\u201COkay, can\
  \ you feel your legs? Can you stand?\u201D\n\n\u201CMaybe.\u201D\n\nI pull my hands\
  \ away from my face. The trail leader crouches beside my head. A sparse medical\
  \ kit lies next to us in the mud.\n\nThe pony I\u2019ve been riding is named Annika.\
  \ It was my fault I fell off. I\u2019d been riding over her neck to avoid the low\
  \ hanging branches of the ancient oaks which line the trail and I had mistimed sitting\
  \ up. I\u2019d caught the last, thick-as-my-thigh branch in the face, flipping off\
  \ backwards. Annika had thrown a shoe as she dashed away, and I was left stunned\
  \ in the mud. \n\nSides slick with sweat, Annika waits for me as I limp up the trail.\
  \ She is only a little taller than the pony I learnt to ride on in my uncle\u2019\
  s cattle yards under a dry sun. A gift from my grandfather, this past pony had doe-like\
  \ eyes and an unruly mane. Annika has the same kind eyes, and though her step is\
  \ slightly lopsided from the thrown shoe, she does her best to cushion my aching\
  \ body as we rise into a slow trot back to the farmhouse slouched beside the creek.\n\
  \nWith a clatter of hooves, we descend the little stone road into the farmyard.\
  \ My face throbs and vision wavers. My uncle is standing in the yard, leaning against\
  \ a pitchfork, but I blink and the open face of Paul swims into view. My uncle wears\
  \ a wide-brimmed Akubra; Paul is wearing a paperboy hat and a wide grin.\n \n\u201C\
  Copped a branch?\u201D\n\nI mumble my response. My upper lip is thick and heavy.\
  \ \n\n\u201CGo see Mum, she\u2019ll fix you up.\u201D\n\nPaul gestures towards his\
  \ mother, Maria. She is standing in the overgrown garden near the house, hands on\
  \ her aproned hips, watching as I walk gingerly up the driveway. She tuts, cocooning\
  \ my face in both hands, before plucking herbs from her garden. She sits me on a\
  \ stool in the kitchen as she makes a comfrey poultice. \n\nMaria fusses over me\
  \ while Paul\u2019s golden-haired children cling to her legs and dart about the\
  \ house. They speak with broad Welsh accents and the confidence of children raised\
  \ on the land. Maria shoos her smallest grandchild outside as she paints my raw\
  \ skin with the bitter dressing. My mouth is too sore to smile, but my heart sings\
  \ for the first time in months."
