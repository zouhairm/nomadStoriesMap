Text: "Something I frequently do to feed my love for driving and road trips is fly\
  \ to a destination and spend a week or so exploring surrounding areas by car. \n\
  \nIn April 2018, and with my two teenage sons, I flew to northern British Columbia\
  \ with the intent of exploring British Columbia and perhaps Yukon. The area is well\
  \ known to be the temporary home of logging and mining workers in the north and\
  \ I wanted my sons to be surrounded totally by nature for a couple weeks as many\
  \ parts there have no phone service or internet. In fact, when we arrived at our\
  \ accommodations, we were given a satellite phone that calls on a medical helicopter\
  \ in case of emergencies!\n\nI am a planner through and through  (events planner\
  \ by trade) and generally have my entire itinerary and route mapped out well before\
  \ I even pay for the trip in full. However, I do recognize the importance of remaining\
  \ open minded and discovering hidden gems.\n\nOn Easter Monday, we headed out on\
  \ the road northwest toward what I thought was just a secluded area in the mountains.\
  \ Lo and behold, we came to discover an American border crossing that was completely\
  \ unmanned! \n\nThis was Hyder, Alaska, \"Alaska's Friendliest Ghost Town\". Bordered\
  \ on Stewart, BC, in the Alaskan panhandle islands, the 40 some odd residents of\
  \ Hyder are completely reliant on Canada for gas, groceries, schooling, electricity\
  \ and phone. To get to anywhere else in Alaska, you must exit Hyder into Canada,\
  \ and enter the mainland of Alaska from Yukon, a 19.5 hour drive away. The only\
  \ businesses in Hyder are a US post office, bar, hotel and general store, of which\
  \ all were closed for the winter when we arrived in April. \n\nOne moment that stands\
  \ out especially took place at the marina in town. A seaplane had landed and dropped\
  \ what seemed to be about 20 Amazon boxes. My son commented aloud that it was funny\
  \ that residents could order Amazon in such large amounts without Internet. A gentleman\
  \ who was waiting for this delivery was nearby and responded that they were mostly\
  \ groceries and household staples that were delivered monthly.\n\nOf all the places\
  \ in the world we have seen, the best life lesson my teen sons could have received\
  \ was the opportunity to watch about 4 children their age having the time of their\
  \ life on a frozen pond just sitting in lawn chairs ice fishing. No matter how little\
  \ this town has, and doesn't have, those that lived there were happy with life."
