Text: "One could, would and should have thought that the palm trees, like the road\
  \ the white taxi was vrooming down on, would eventually come to an end. But it didn\u2019\
  t. In this part of Tulum, you can forget about pinpointing down an address \u2013\
  \ this kind of vegetational conditions requires your gut feeling to serve as the\
  \ northern star. Something that Juan, 43, with a Tom Selleck mustachio and tan,\
  \ had no problems in applying while gently hitting the breaks and making that same\
  \ taxi go less vroom on us. \n\nLa Suerte del Coyote were celebrating their first\
  \ day on, what the owner was hoping, was going to be a smooth soft opening.  \n\u201C\
  One glass of mezcal coming right up for the pretty lady\u201D, a dampen voice was\
  \ heard saying, somewhere from the corner were the bar was so strategically placed,\
  \ overlooking the entrance that was decorated with palm leaves.\nI acted surprised\
  \ in a way my mother thought me to act, not wanting to state the obvious \u2013\
  \ that I was the pretty lady \u2013 and stayed humble like I always did when words\
  \ of appreciation was thrown at me. \nAnd shortly did that glass of mezcal arrive\
  \ and I started to understand why the voice was dampen as the man\u2019s mouth was\
  \ well hidden behind a firmly groomed beard. A firmly groomed beard that would make\
  \ all the hipsters in Brooklyn cry of envy. \n\n\u201CMy name is Emanuel and I own\
  \ this place. What do you know about mezcal\u201D, he gently asked while putting\
  \ down the glass in front of me. \nI assumed that by the look on my face, Emanuel\
  \ quickly realized that I did not know much about mezcal as he so eagerly started\
  \ to tell me everything there is to know about this alcoholic beverage made from\
  \ agave. \n\u201CIn this part of Mexico, mezcal is not produced but I am going to\
  \ change that with La Suerte del Coyote. My family is originally from Oaxaca and\
  \ we have been producing mezcal for many, many years, in fact, the production of\
  \ mezcal has been passed down from generation to generation. So it feels like my\
  \ duty to take this tradition to Tulum\u201D, he said and pointed at a cantaro jar,\
  \ a jar that is usually used for serving mescal, and that was barely visible standing\
  \ proudly in one of the restaurants corners. \n\u201CIn that cantaro jar\u2026 well,\
  \ it\u2019s where the magic happens. Or maybe it\u2019s better to say that it\u2019\
  s where the magic is\u201D, Emanuel said while laughing so hard that his body was\
  \ trembling much like Santa\u2019s belly when doing the whole \u201CHo Ho Ho\u201D\
  \ scene. \n\nLater that evening, after tasting ten different kinds of mezcal, I\
  \ started to understand the appeal of this intoxicating beverage made from the sweetest\
  \ and sacred plants in Mexico. And while I was leaving this hidden gem, a cocoon\
  \ surrounded by palm trees, with an interior not so different from the surrounding\
  \ itself, I came to realize that Emanuel was not only referring to the cantaro jar\
  \ when he was talking about magic, he was referring to La Suerte del Coyote itself.\
  \ His La Suerte del Coyote; a place paved with mezcal. And palm trees that there\u2019\
  s no end to."
