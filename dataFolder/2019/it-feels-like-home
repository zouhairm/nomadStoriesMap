Text: "14th November 2018 at 3.45-ish PM, I flew from Jakarta to Bangkok. For some\
  \ reason, I happened to be extremely unprepared for this trip. Unlike most travelers,\
  \ I came to Bangkok without having my what-to-do and where-to-go list. I only had\
  \ my flight and hostel secured.\nAll I had in mind was I just wanted to have a little\
  \ bit of break from work. I wanted to enjoy the world just for once without thinking\
  \ someone would scream on my phone, asked me to do stuff. Random but understandable,\
  \ if I may excuse.\n\nDAY 1\n1.00-ish AM, I arrived in the city. Not having a lot\
  \ of information, I opted to take a cab. I was surprised to figure out that the\
  \ driver dared himself to introduce me to sort of a red district. There were a lot\
  \ of ladies\u2014 or +boys\u2014 not sure what I got there. We passed through the\
  \ district. Not long after, a middle-age man pointed his flashlight to our car.\
  \ I was shocked and prayed that I would not lose my virginity during the first day\
  \ of my trip or any point, actually. The driver was laughing at how I reacted. I\
  \ guess he was\u2014on purpose\u2014trying to make fun of me. Well, that was a very\
  \ memorable first impression of this country.\n\nI arrived at the hostel. There\
  \ were 5 people already in my room, living their dreams. It was 8 bunk-bed room,\
  \ so yeah. One person was still up and had time to actually say hi to me. \nFast\
  \ forward to my actual proper first day in Bangkok, I took myself out to mall after\
  \ mall, basically. Nothing intriguing to share until I realized that I came here\
  \ for marathon. Right away, I was rushing back to hostel to check whether or not\
  \ I have all my race kits. Thankfully, I did bring stuffs that are close enough\
  \ for race kits. \n\nDAY 2\nNothing to worth remembering here. Oh wait, by the end\
  \ of the second day, I actually made my first travel buddy here. Yes, the one threw\
  \ a \u2018hi\u2019 to me. His name is James, flying so far away from California\
  \ to Bangkok, trying to start his own company. Staying in Thailand for 2 weeks,\
  \ working on his business. I wished that my trip could be as inspiring as his. Okay,\
  \ stop with the wishy washy. We went for a dinner that day. We kind of clicked and\
  \ even talked about personal stuff already. Digging personal traits, sharing family\
  \ issues, discussing career aspiration, gushing world\u2019s problem in general.\
  \ \n\nDAY 3\nBasically, yesterday repeated itself. However, \u201Csomething\u201D\
  \ happened. I did confess to James about something I have shared with only 2 people\
  \ by far. Everything was kind of like leading to that moment though. We were about\
  \ to watch a movie that covered the issue, he out of the blue asked me the question\
  \ and I spoke nothing else, but truth. Frankly \u201Cwriting\u201D\u2014pun intended\u2014\
  I was crying inside.\n\n\nDAY 4\nThe main reason why I kind of had to go to Bangkok,\
  \ 10K marathon. It went pretty well, that is all. During that day, I could not help\
  \ thinking that I was going back to work in 2 days going to leave Bangkok tomorrow.\
  \ I felt like I was at home with so much ease while I was there. I was having the\
  \ time of my life. One thing that also made me blue was I could not fulfill my funny\
  \ Japanese roommate to go out for a drink. I ALREADY BOOKED A MORNING FLIGHT. He\
  \ could not speak English well, so he made funny gesture of his reaction on my rejection.\
  \ I wish that I could have more time to spend with them.\n\nDAY 5\nI was just a\
  \ mess like sad emoji(s).\n\nThe Bangkok trip marks my first-ever solo trip. By\
  \ the time I wrote this, I already had my second to Hong Kong. I must admit that\
  \ none has topped what I found in Bangkok. I found something that I did not expect\
  \ to get outside my home country. Friends I made, strangers I met, stupid things\
  \ I did. It feels like home."
