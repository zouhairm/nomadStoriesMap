Text: "Santiago de Compostela, Is  a magical town located in Northern Spain and the\
  \ capital of Galicia. It is well known for being the goal of many \u201CPeregrinos\u201D\
  \ walking the Jacob\u2019s way through the  peregrination path called in Spanish:\
  \ Camino de Santiago.\n\nMany peregrinos have walked this path for centuries. In\
  \ the past it was a very important comercial path. Designed to provide food and\
  \ products to the people living in the area. This commercial route has different\
  \ caminos that cross through Spain and they all end in Santiago. You can find all\
  \ kinds of different landscapes. From forests to more arid places. Visually it takes\
  \ you into a meditation state once you start walking the Camino. People say that\
  \  Camino de Santiago or the Jacob\u2019s Path in English was traced following the\
  \ constellations. Guiding pilgrims at night by following the stars light. \n\nThis\
  \ peregrination path is full of energy and magic. Whether you believe in magic or\
  \ not, as the law of thermodynamics says energy can only be transformed not destroyed.\
  \ I mention this because once you start walking this path you can feel the energy\
  \ of the people that have walked through centuries. Doing the camino  takes you\
  \ to a very deep place inside yourself and if you open yourself to the spiritual\
  \ experience you can feel sparkles in your soul.\n\nIt was 10 years ago when I decided\
  \ to walk the Camino. With my backpack ready and my boots on, I started walking\
  \ the northern path all the way to Santiago de Compostela. I walked almost 800 kilometers,\
  \ crossing beautiful landscapes and meeting the most wonderful people. \n\nWhen\
  \ I finally arrived to Santiago, I realized the path to Santiago was the goal and\
  \ not Santiago itself. When you start a trip you usually set goals, cities you want\
  \ to visit, museums, towns, restaurants. But when the trip is over you realize that\
  \ the goal wasn't a city In specific. but each and every experience you lived, every\
  \ meal you ate, the companion you had, the sunsets you watched, the culture you\
  \ experienced. \n\nOne of the things I remember the most about walking to Santiago,\
  \ was the day I arrived. I entered the city early in the morning in company of two\
  \ of my pilgrim friends, one was from Australia and the other one from Germany,\
  \ We arrived to the Cathedral of Santiago a Sunday maybe at 11 in the morning. When\
  \ we saw the Cathedral, the 3 of us just drop ourselves on the ground. We were completely\
  \ surrendered to the experience, the 3 of us had walked almost 800 kilometers since\
  \ we started. The path showed us many things, we were not the same humans that we\
  \ were before we started.\n\nI was crying, tears of happiness and tiredness were\
  \ dropping through my chicks, I was holding my head with my hands, laughing and\
  \ crying. At that moment,  I saw a tourist taking pictures of me. Saving that moment\
  \ of pure human emotions on its camera. I didn't asked for the images. I was to\
  \ shocked in muy moment to approach him. I have always wondered If I will one day\
  \ see my pictures online with a sentence  saying: Are you this girl? I am looking\
  \ for her, I want to send her all the pictures I took from her as she arrived to\
  \ Santiago de Compostela. I also wonder what could this mas been thinking about\
  \ the moment I was living, From his perspective, what did he saw? I have no idea.\
  \ \n\nTraveling for me is exactly that, surrendering to the culture, people and\
  \ places you visit. Wondering around and opening your mind to different perspectives,\
  \ ideas and moments that will be kept in your mind and cameras."
