Text: "Looking out from the train window, my eyes were trying to capture what it could\
  \ of the fleeting images outside. Farms and luscious green fields spread far and\
  \ wide and the air was filled with the lingering scent of petrichor. \nAs a 14-year-old,\
  \ I was thrilled and excited for my first solo trip to the jungles of Bandhavgarh.\
  \ After much pleading my parents allowed me to take on this trip all by myself with\
  \ an excursion group. In India it is quite a task to persuade your parents to say\
  \ \u201Cyes\u201D to certain things; a solo trip was one of them. Bandhavgarh National\
  \ Park is spread around 500 sq. km across The Vindhya Hills in Madhya Pradesh, India.\
  \ It has the highest population of the Royal Bengal Tiger in India. The 15-hour\
  \ train journey was exhausting but the exhilarating experiences that followed made\
  \ it all worth it. On reaching our destination in the evening we freshened up, had\
  \ some scrumptious dinner made by a local chef and hit the sack as we had an early\
  \ morning the next day.\n4:00 am my alarm went off, I jumped from my bed and was\
  \ out of the tent fresh and ready for the jungle safari. I could not wait to meet\
  \ the Royal Bengal Tiger. We got into our jeeps and approached towards the Jungle.\
  \ It was a whole new world in there where wildlife and nature peacefully co-existed.\
  \ My 14-year-old self was all ready to capture the essence of life in the wild.\
  \ \nZooming in our fleet of safari jeeps we advanced towards the center of the juggle.\
  \ We first saw a herd of Wild Gaur and some owlets on a tree hooting and adding\
  \ to the eeriness of the forest. A couple of hours passed, the dawn faded, and as\
  \ the twilight covered the jungle our hopes of spotting a tiger sunk. \nSuddenly,\
  \ there was a buzz on the guide\u2019s walkie-talkie ... a tigress was spotted by\
  \ another group a few meters from where we were.  Our fleet rushed towards the said\
  \ location after a few minutes our jeeps come to a screeching halt, we were in between\
  \ and on our left and right was the forest... the monkeys around made cacophonic\
  \ calls and that was a sign that the tiger was not very far. The air was filled\
  \ with a filthy stench\u2026 suddenly someone said there is a \u201CKILL\u201D ...\
  \ all of us were looking here and there to find out what it was, and our sight froze\
  \ when we saw two low-lying eyes gazing upon us from the bushes. \nA majestic Tigress\
  \ was holding a deer in her mouth on our right.  She looked angry. It did not take\
  \ us much time to figure out why. Her babies were separated from her and we were\
  \ blocking her path! The cubs kept purring and calling for their mother\u2026and\
  \ then the tigress did something none of us in that jeep could ever forget.\nShe\
  \ left the kill there are approached towards our jeep \u2026my heart stopped for\
  \ a brief moment ... she pounced and took a huge jump right above our heads and\
  \ landed on the left side of the road where her cubs were. The image is still so\
  \ fresh \u2026 her stretched out body and her stripes right above my head ... I\
  \ was frozen ... I thought I am going to die on my first solo trip. She looked back\
  \ at us for a brief moment and vanished into the jungle with her cubs. This experience\
  \ taught me two things, Patience is bitter, but its fruit is sweet and all the forces\
  \ on this planet, will never beat that of a mother's love.\nOn my way back, I sat\
  \ by the train window \u2026 fascinated by the mysteries that shroud the forests;\
  \ wondering what lurks in the wild, when the jeeps are all gone."
