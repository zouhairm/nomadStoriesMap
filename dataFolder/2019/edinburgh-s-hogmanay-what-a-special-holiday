Text: "It took me a little while to leave my Airbnb this morning. Exhaustion is hard\
  \ but losing daylight during the time of year of the shortest days, jeopardizing\
  \ the creation of precious, unique, adventurous stories that are mine to experience\
  \ is harder; I had pushed through. Google maps directed me to the center of town\
  \ in under 25 minutes via foot. \nWalking through that park with the lush grass,\
  \ crisp air, under the tunnel of trees, alongside people jogging, riding bikes,\
  \ playing fetch with their dogs, admiring the beautiful buildings of this \"story-book\"\
  \ looking town: this was just another moment of bliss for me as I entered into the\
  \ heart of the city. I started heading down that same \"mile road\" thousands of\
  \ us had just marched on the night prior with our torch lights in hand looking like\
  \ we were off to burn a witch as the wax dripped onto our clothes and the fire burned\
  \ too close to our hair and faces during this procession. \n\nWandering up and down\
  \ this street, I find cute, funny post cards to send to my parents as this was the\
  \ biggest trip I had taken yet, my first time overseas, and my first time really\
  \ solo exploring. I think I wrote something like: \"I'm still alive! and I'm fully\
  \ enjoying these fantastic cities, except it's so cold and my hand is numb writing\
  \ this letter right now.\" I put a cute Edinburgh Castle stamp on my first ever\
  \ purchased post card and mailed that sucker out... Of course I had to buy a copy\
  \ for myself as a souvenir.  Update: it took them over a month and a half to receive\
  \ their post card.\n\nPassing by a bagpipe player in a kilt on the street, stopping\
  \ to appreciate him and this moment for just a moment, I then hop into a cab to\
  \ head to part II of this three day festival. I exit the cab near the entrance of\
  \ the event and start walking toward the perfectly sized crowd. The first two men\
  \ I met were singing and dancing freely so naturally I joined in. Next thing I know,\
  \ I have fallen but continue dancing on the ground because it's just simply good\
  \ fun. \n\nA couple fireworks were being set off every hour up until the big midnight\
  \ production, and the next and most vivid memory I hold dear was my personal midnight\
  \ experience. Holy shit this was a powerful moment. I cried from the astonishment\
  \ of watching those magical fireworks being launched from that incredible 12th century\
  \ castle. I just couldn't believe where I was in this moment, and in life. I've\
  \ come so far, literally and figuratively. I just had such a proud moment mixed\
  \ with awe of the beauty. I was standing in front of an actual ancient castle, in\
  \ Scotland, for the holidays, that was changing colors from neon pink to neon blue;\
  \ I was a happy person again. I rose out of the hell hole of a mind frame I was\
  \ consumed in during 2016/2017 and I put it all behind me, ending 2017 with a BANG.\
  \ That was the first time in my life I broke down in tears from happiness and not\
  \ from pain...which I had experienced too many of those tears for too long. It was\
  \ at this moment I felt like a new woman; I had pushed through. \n\nI continued\
  \ celebrating the release of the previous negative emotional year with the embrace\
  \ of the upcoming positive emotional year by running around yelling \"HAPPY NEW\
  \ YEAR\" to everyone I walked by in that crowd, and we danced and cheered together.\
  \ \n\nGoogle maps directed me back to my Airbnb via foot and I walked up and down\
  \ those streets and back through that park at one in the morning with a born-again\
  \ smile on my face and a glisten in my eyes reflecting pure joy ejecting from within;\
  \ more happy tears accompanied with a breath of fresh Scottish air."
