Text: "Eighteen hours. Eighteen hours, way too much time for a person with aerophobia\
  \ to float in the air. \n\nEyes popping out, I felt the plane lifting its feet off\
  \ the surface. The idea of me away from the earth was making my breathing heavy.\
  \ I wanted those hours to pass as soon as possible. At least the first eight hours,\
  \ where I would have ground under my feet once again. Be it only for few hours.\
  \ \nAll the episodes of Air Crash Investigation were danced in my eyes. Especially\
  \ the one where the plane fell into the ocean. It took years to find its whereabouts.\
  \ My head spun with the thought of the passengers. I didn\u2019t want that to happen\
  \ to me. I didn\u2019t wish to be food for the hungry sharks below. Served grilled\
  \ and toasted. \n\nI was wide awake. Restless. Just in case if I die, I wouldn\u2019\
  t die in my sleep. Neither movies nor music cooled me. All I wished was to stand\
  \ at my destination in a wink. \n\nTo distract myself I recalled the beautiful beginning\
  \ of my journey. Mumbai International Airport. A freshly tailored port limited to\
  \ ticket holders only. This was my first time in twenty-five years. A ticket to\
  \ the forbidden area. Tall, sleek pillars hold carved roof above our heads. Sparkling\
  \ granite beneath our shoes. A glimpse of rich traditional Indian art showcased\
  \ down the ally. Shops and restaurants catered people from different parts of the\
  \ globe. This was actually the place, I thought, where people from all race, cast,\
  \ color, gender, nationality gathered without reservations. \n\nI was half-way through,\
  \ a voice commanded me to fasten my seat belt and pull up the window shades. Heartbeat\
  \ plunging above the roof and sweaty palms I obeyed the command. Slowly, the latitude\
  \ began to lowing on the screen in front of me.  \n\nJust few more minutes, I comforted\
  \ myself. As we came closer to the earth the cloud began thinning. The vision was\
  \ much clear.  \nIt simply took my breath away. The picturesque still mesmerizes\
  \ me. Rays of sun smiled at the row of tiny little houses sitting on the green carpet.\
  \ An image I had as wallpaper. I smiled, hoping I had a camera with me. Smoke pumped\
  \ out of the chimney with red brick roofs. Coming from a country with a population\
  \ of 133.92 crores. Frankfurt seemed way more serene, even from this height.\n\n\
  Eventually, after touching the ground I felt the bliss of inhaling fresh air of\
  \ the German world. \n\nEven though it was an unknown land among unknown people\
  \ with unknown language holding unknown currency. The only way of communication\
  \ was gestures. With the help of what I had, I succeeded in shopping a little souvenir\
  \ just to make Frankfurt part of my journey. The first purchase of my first journey\
  \ to a new land. A tall beer glass \u2013 even though I don\u2019t drink - with\
  \ tiny row houses on it.     \n\nThis little adventure of mine in the world of the\
  \ unknown was fascinating. It opened my eyes to a more exciting world. A world to\
  \ explore through heart rather than words.   \n\nThis time when I boarded the plane\
  \ again, I was nervous and excited than nervous and scared. \nExcited to explore\
  \ my destination in a new light. \n\nTrust me, when I landed this time, the Statue\
  \ of Liberty stood more proudly and elegantly within the blue layers of the Hudson\
  \ River."
