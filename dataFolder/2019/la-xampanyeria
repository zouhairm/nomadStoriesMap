Text: "I nudged my way through the thick commotion in front of the glass counter.\
  \ Its hot. But it's that nice hot of standing out near a marina, feeling the light\
  \ breeze of spring and just enough sun to feel it warm up the back of your t-shirt.\
  \ Inside its warmer, under its low slung roof and cave like walls, lined with rows\
  \ of wine barrels used as table tops, it leave little less than room wide for a\
  \ couple of people to make a line, yet the cave with glass doors is teeming with\
  \ locals, tourists and wanderers alike, all happy to be here for the same thing.\
  \ As I get to the counter squished by the mob, I order \u201Cel numero 3,  un plato\
  \ mixto, y una copa.\u201D He writes down my order over the bustle and just like\
  \ that, my golden ticket is off and I wait while my copa begins to fill. Sweet,\
  \ luscious, pungent pink is the cava rosada, the house specialty take on the national\
  \ sparkling wine. But do not let the idea of glamorous fuchsia champagne have you\
  \ mistaken for a fancy modern quick dine. Above the wall lined wine barrels are\
  \ hung photos and newspaper clippings of Barcelona and Cataluyna's History. The\
  \ counter, while fingerprinted on the outside, impeccably clean on the inside, is\
  \ of an old style decor with a rimmed cover accent trim of a pale yellow lining,\
  \ and up above it hang robust mounds of sausages and chorizo, bringing your gaze\
  \ back down to the stiff black stocked kitchen where all the heat, steam, and sizzle\
  \ come out. Be it the glasses poured or the fire in the kitchen, we all feel warm\
  \ inside. And my glass fills again as I\u2019ve found myself in conversation with\
  \ Julio, one of the older gentleman behind the bar, one of the ones running the\
  \ show. The place has not changed in almost 100 years, \u201C..as you see it is\
  \ as its been\u201D he tells me in thick Castilian Spanish of the popular embutido\
  \ sausage and meat stand. \u201C...and I have been working here since I was a boy\
  \ with the original family owners;and look now what that time has aged me\u201D\
  \ He bolsters as hands me my plates and fills my glass on the house again, every\
  \ other glass in fact. He walks over to help others and gestures hell be back soon\
  \ enough, so I'm left to delve into the delicacies. As warm air rises from the fresh\
  \ grilled meat, juices run down my hand before I can even take a bite. Words would\
  \ be at waste to attempt to describe the luscious tender meat or the fatty fragrant\
  \ chorizo and morcilla. But as I revel in the flavors I can't help but to think,\
  \ so this is what it was probably like, The bundles of people blissfully eating\
  \ and unbending, fun and flirtatiously, washing it down with cool sparkling cave\
  \ from champagne bottles that fill them up only to be twirled around by laughter\
  \ and cavorting only to be filled again. People, from all paths crossing for a sole\
  \ similar reason, exchanging in the moment, as has been happening for generations\
  \ past \u2018as its been.\u2019 As Julio returns to fill my last glass, I ask for\
  \ the check and ask him why he never left, or if he ever had the chance and replied\
  \ \u201Cthis what you see here is how its always been. This energy, who wouldn't\
  \ want to come back everyday to experience it.\u201D I see his case. I pull out\
  \ my debit card and he shakes, \u201Cno cards, cash only.\u201D Of course, nothing\
  \ has changed, \u201CI should have figured\u201D, I tell him. \u201CDon't worry,\
  \ come back tomorrow. I trust you. By then, I will have remembered more stories.\u201D\
  \ And with that, I saw just what he meant, and I will always go back."
