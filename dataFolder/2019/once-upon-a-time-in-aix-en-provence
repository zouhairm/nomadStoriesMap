Text: "Heading to Aix-en-Provence in the south of France, city of Paul Cezanne, one\
  \ of those magical places full of history , architecture, good gastronomy, arts,\
  \ the smell of pain au chocolat and cafe all around the city, the tourists, me,\
  \ and my gps to help me navigate around the unknown streets of that beautiful city.\n\
  Cezanne is an obssession for me and it was a trip planned for one year, i would\
  \ visit all the south, but head first thing to Aix to fell closer that place where\
  \ that immortal painter lived his life and created his art, wich is all around in\
  \ every single detail overthere, but I was not lucky at all that day, because of\
  \ a huge renovation made in the city, many of the historical places were closed,\
  \ and had no specific date to re-open, for my nightmare, I could only see the house\
  \ of Paul Cezanne from outside, a bit far, I was completly devasted after waiting\
  \ for so long and had spend so much energy on it.\nIt was nearly 4 pm, i went around\
  \ the city and visited another monuments, the historical fountains, apreciate the\
  \ beautiful architecture, and landscape, read the story around the streets, but\
  \ it started to rain, and I run into a really cozy and beautiful caf\xE9, to stop,\
  \ sit and renovate my energies, put my ideas back on track and stop grieving for\
  \ not having seeing all about Paul Cezanne I wanted to. \nWhen the waiter approached\
  \ , I asked for a cappuccino (one of my favourites beverages) and at the same time\
  \ I required a bit o cinammon with it. At that same moment, the waiter stopped,\
  \ looked at me and said: That\xB4s interesting, do you know who used to ask a cappuccino\
  \ with a hint of cinammon on top of it? Paul Cezanne, and he used to come here everyday,\
  \ sit in the exactly table where u are and ask for it with a little madaleine (a\
  \ famous french little cake).\nEither you beleive in spirits, cosmic conection,\
  \ quantum physics, or whatever it\xB4s, I strongly felt that Paul Cezanne was simply\
  \ sending a message to me: Enjoy every single momentof this life, because no experience\
  \ is lost."
