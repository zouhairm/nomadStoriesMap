Text: "We are seem to have those times in life where we wonder what our purpose is.\
  \ We exist but we are not living. When I received the opportunity to travel I took\
  \ it despite of what was happening in my current day to day routine. It's a writer's\
  \ dream to travel & write. In Portugal 10 writer's all came together & created art,\
  \ everlasting memories & possibilities for aspiring writers to come. May & Jason\
  \ two of our fellow writers even fall in love during the trip. We danced , laughed\
  \ and created. Some of the most exquisite wine was tasted. Somw dishes I'll include\
  \ in my cookbook was prepared. Scenery that can't be replaced was discovered & stored\
  \ in my brain. One monument \"Torre de Bel\xE9m\" in Lisbon was sitting among the\
  \ water. It was created in the 15th century it runs along the Tagus river. \"Bom\
  \ Jesus do Monte\" supposedly is one of the most important sites in the country\
  \ such a masterpiece. It is definitely a work of art & a sight to see. One day our\
  \ writing assignment was strictly for our personal opinions on different historical\
  \ subjects. My travel blog will include the rest of the trip!"
