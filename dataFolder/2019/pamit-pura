Text: "Edo picked me up in Bali. He was wearing a batik shirt and a name tag. Without\
  \ a word, he dropped me off at a hotel for a nap. He could tell that I was exhausted.\
  \ I dreamed about the Buddhist monks I met at Angkor Wat seeming to float along\
  \ the pond in their bright orange robes like lotus flowers.\n\nI woke up to the\
  \ scent of Cendana and Frangipani. Edo and I had Nasi Goreng for breakfast and I\
  \ stared at the terraces of rice surrounding us. I awkwardly introduced myself,\
  \ my grandma, and how she was cousins with his boss. He asked me if I had ever been\
  \ to Bali. I told him that this was my first trip outside of the U.S. and this was\
  \ my last stop before heading back home.\n\n\u201CEver try Kopi Luwak coffee?\u201D\
  \ Edo asked. We were at a coffee plantation and he told me that it was a delicacy\
  \ of Bali that I needed to try. I thought of the table of delicacies when our field\
  \ study arrived in Padang. I hesitated, but said, \u201CLet\u2019s do it!\u201D\
  \ He asked me how I liked the coffee and I said it was great. He pointed to a sign\
  \ and I read that the coffee beans were fermented civet cat intestines first. I\
  \ just had Balinese coffee poop.\n\n\u201CEver try Suckling Pig?\u201D he asked.\
  \ He pulled over to the side of the road where a middle aged man was roasting a\
  \ pig on a spit in an open field. I missed the Beef Rendang from Java and Sumatra,\
  \ which were Muslim islands. I pined for the Khmer curry from Siem Reap and the\
  \ Massaman curry from Phuket. After I pushed the pork around on my plate with my\
  \ fingers, we walked back to the car. I almost lost my footing, and peered into\
  \ the eyes of a wild boar. I screamed. I heard Edo chuckling. It was just a mask.\n\
  \n\u201CShould I buy some bananas for the monkeys?\u201D I pointed to the ancient\
  \ women at several tables selling bunches of bananas to tourists at the entrance\
  \ to the monkey sanctuary. \u201CYes, you should.\u201D He said. I was delighted.\
  \ I walked over to an ancient woman and bought a bunch of yellow and green bananas.\
  \ Her lined face wrinkled as she smiled at me. Before I could turn around, a monkey\
  \ ran toward me. The monkey crawled up my body, grabbed the whole bunch of bananas\
  \ and ran away. I looked over. Edo and the ladies were howling.\n\nThe next day,\
  \ Edo asked if I would rather go with him to a family gathering or spend the day\
  \ in Ubud. As we drove to the village to spend the day with family, I noticed tiny\
  \ boxes with flowers and incense in front of the doors of people\u2019s homes and\
  \ buildings. Those are Canang sari, or Hindu offerings, he told me.\n\nEdo was getting\
  \ married few days away on his Island of Flores, Indonesia which is predominantly\
  \ Catholic. His bride, from Bali, is Hindu. Before they could get married, his bride\
  \ needed to relinquish herself from Hinduism and have a Catholic baptism. They plan\
  \ to continue to living on Bali near her family. However, she needed to cease any\
  \ Hindu practices and begin living as a Catholic. Most Balinese women are Hindu\
  \ and matriarchal. \n\nA few women took me to the house to get ready. The house\
  \ was painted red and had a curved gable roof. Inside, the layout was different\
  \ from the Minangkabau on Sumatra. Both places matriarchal, but completely different\
  \ heritage. The bride was being pampered by women from her village. A woman my age\
  \ gave me a batik dress to wear, a teenaged girl put my hair up into a twist, an\
  \ ancient woman put rice on my forehead, and a middle aged woman took my picture\
  \ with the teenaged girl. I caught the look of sadness in the bride\u2019s eyes\
  \ when she thought no one was watching. Pamit Pura. It was a farewell to Hinduism."
