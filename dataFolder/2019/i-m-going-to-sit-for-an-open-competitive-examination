Text: "Thinking twice, I don't know why, I'm just going. The public tender is at another\
  \ city. The wage is better. Maybe that is why am I going to do the position? I can't\
  \ remember. I didn't study for it.  Well, this's a lie: I read three books, wrote\
  \ a summary and read some laws. Only. This can't hold a candle to what I should've\
  \ done.\nI'm writing inside a bus. The trip'll extended more four hours.  I've choose\
  \ a book to entertain myself: Amora. I'm getting off my town and going to the capital.\
  \ I've been two day early to buy my ticket. I had the desire to sit in a chair at\
  \ the right side, middle and next to a window. I done it, number 25. The chair's\
  \ comfortable, minimally. It don't fix with my back. Black, navy, yellow and grey\
  \ made an abstract painting at the upholstered. The onde at my side are empty. At\
  \ top are my book. Next to the other window are a boy. Bares feet\u2019s, jumpers\
  \ blue paints and a leather band. I cannot see his face, but he's sleeping. His\
  \ feet\u2019s fingernails need some care, like mines. At my round are another people.\
  \ I don't see them, nor I desire or need that. There's a little child some behind\
  \ chair. She cried. Now, just grumble.\nAt another window side, backgrond at the\
  \ landscape, are a sugar cane, an enormous number of them. At the middle, some threes,\
  \ lost. At the opposite cover of the road are hectares of the same. Now there's,\
  \ at my side, a tinny and natural plantation. The shape and the form of the plot\
  \ reveal a riparian forest, that means, cannot destroy this to give some space for\
  \ more sugar cane. Some trucks crop at left: white, blue, naked, with cars, flammable\
  \ fluid, mail service, with a little black cover. There are cars too: many colours.\n\
  We're nearly an industrial place. There's energy posts. . When I was young, I've\
  \ imagined there were robots. The robots was alive and righted to their people hegemony.\
  \ Each shape one robot. They thrower their lazes to kill their enemies. Suddenly,\
  \ a light came over and solidify them. All os them are, today, like a millions years\
  \ ago. The men\u2019s discovered an enormous force of energy at them lights, also\
  \ petrified, and uses it to energy resources.\nI have a fertile imagination.\nAt\
  \ the background, far away from the sugar cane, I can see sugar cane ingenuity.\
  \ There's small, wide closely. The bricks demarcate the brown construction. The\
  \ dispositions of the property denote there ingenuity classification. Can be possible\
  \ that are working? How much histories are at that place? How much violence? How\
  \ much pain? How much cries? How much smiles? How much how\u2019s?\nNow there're\
  \ a decline. The plain was dismissed, that's a depression. I'm going down a hill\
  \ with so many curves. I can see some industries, some news, other not. Fumes go\
  \ out to the chimneys. Around it, more creping green. It is impossible to detect\
  \ it species. The native vegetation, fell, at around are parched. Why: winter. This\
  \ is typical of cerrado. It is possible to see some parts of fires at the background.\
  \ Also typical. I think that is strange this parts drought and burned, there are\
  \ fell weeks are raining. Who am I to judge the creation of somebody else that not\
  \ the sapiens?\nThere's, some time ago, little and white constructions. At the middle,\
  \ a creeping green with unknowing species. Sympatetic shanties. Around, white spots.\
  \ Some of them are unpretentiously moving. Cows. Males or females? I don't know.\n\
  Kilometer number 234. Kilometer number 235. Kilometer 236. 237. I need to arrive\
  \ at the zero.\nNews factories are coming. News shanties. More white spots. Another\
  \ factory. A billboard: you're at 24 minutes to. A town are approaching it's what\
  \ that means. They don't say exactly you are coming to the. It's possible to see\
  \ fell billboards for the travellers: gas station and output option. The town arise\
  \ from the two sides. Tall and small constructions pass as quickly as possible.\n\
  Forty five minutes at the road. A grandiose three. A town. My backache."
