Text: "\u201DOrecchiette,\u201D She explained with a smile, holding a single piece\
  \ of pasta up to the side of my head. \u201CCome un orecchio.\u201D\n\nI and thirteen\
  \ others are currently standing like the awkward flock of tourists we are, around\
  \ a happy Italian grandmother (she had happily shown us a framed photo of her grandson)\
  \ on her own front step.\n\nMy friend and I were the last minute addition to a walking\
  \ tour of Bari when we arrived too early for our ferry to Greece. We would\u2019\
  ve loathed wasting our last few hours, so we\u2019d begun to wander around the port\
  \ until we saw a tour offering last minute drop in\u2019s. Frankly, that\u2019s\
  \ exactly what we were; travellers desperate to absorb all we could before moving\
  \ on to the next venture.\n\nAs we walk the cobbled roads towards the Basilica San\
  \ Nicola, we gradually get off the touristy streets, walking between peoples homes.\
  \ It\u2019s a proper neighbourhood, I realize. Our tour guide was sociable, I catch\
  \ the universal tone of harmless flattery dropping from his mouth to the local women\
  \ settled in their doorways. We can hear children giggling inside and the static\
  \ of television in the background floating through the open doors.\n\nIt was quiet.\n\
  \nNot in a silent way, but in contrast to the bustling roar of Bari that we\u2019\
  d just left behind. The livelihood became more and more distant for every side street\
  \ our group turned down, another wall of apartments with layers stacked helter-skelter\
  \ atop each other between us and the metropolitan city. It was quiet in the sense\
  \ that it didn\u2019t sound like we meters away from one of Italy\u2019s busiest\
  \ metropolitan cities. It sounded like it could be a neighbourhood right out of\
  \ my minuscule Canadian town. It was a warm sense of familiarity in a trip that\
  \ had been as nerve-wracking as it was electrifying.\n\nThe women were comfortably\
  \ set up in their doorways, settled in for the long haul of the day; chair on the\
  \ front step, tables across their laps. It wasn\u2019t just one either, I realized.\
  \ Down the uneven street, as far as I could see, mirror images of each other, even\
  \ echoing minuscule hand movements.\n\nTheir hands were kneading, folding, pinching\
  \ tiny balls of dough on the table in front of us. Once one was apparently deemed\
  \ good enough, it was set aside as its master took up a new piece. The lady whose\
  \ home we were currently flocked around seemed delighted to have us, and she had\
  \ amassed a particularly impressive pile of finished pasta and was leaving it for\
  \ the sun to dry.\n\nIn the second between her placing one piece down and picking\
  \ up the next, she looked me directly and caught my eye. She paused, had with the\
  \ pasta hovering in midair over the pile. She smiled at me, wrinkles folding up\
  \ into long-familiar smile lines.\n\nShe held the single, fresh piece still in her\
  \ hand and raised it up to my head. \u201DOrecchiette,\u201D She smiled at me warmly.\
  \ \u201CCome un orecchio.\u201D\n\nIt got quiet for a moment before our guide let\
  \ out a chuckle. \u201COrecchiette is named after the ear, the orecchio, since it\
  \ looks like one.\u201D\n\nWhen I looked down at the pile once again, there it was\
  \ - a little pile of ear-shaped pasta.\n\LWe couldn\u2019t stay long, the tour had\
  \ places to be, and since most of the tourists were eager to get on with it, to\
  \ our final destination of the basilica, we had to be on our way shortly. We waved\
  \ goodbye to the grandmothers, le nonne, and they replied with the same, enthusiastically.\n\
  \nOur pass through the neighbourhood on the way to the basilica was less than twenty\
  \ minutes, but it felt like more and stayed with me as if it was. It was such a\
  \ genuine piece of Italian culture, free from the gentrification aimed at tourists.\
  \ I hadn\u2019t expected to see this, just a few streets away from the port. It\
  \ has given me a new perspective on travelling, and what we all should aim to find\
  \ if we want to actually experience a country for what it really is."
