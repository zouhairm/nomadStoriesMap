Text: "I always loved to travel. I think i've got the genes from my parents. I've\
  \ grown up listening my mom tell me all the stories from her childhood trips and\
  \ my dad even had a small travel agency with his school friends. When I was a child\
  \ we used to travel every single summer vacation. My father used to plan everything,\
  \ print the maps, check the car. My mother was responsible for making the most delicious\
  \ snacks, preparing the camera so that our memories and stories could stay warm\
  \ for a lifetime, my brother was responsible for picking up our small mattress that\
  \ would be opened in the small space between the car seats, where we would take\
  \ turns receiving my grandfather's best caresses, and I was the one who chose the\
  \ songs that would be the soundtrack of that adventure. We used to spent week after\
  \ week on the road, exploring the coolest places in the country. I always felt free\
  \ and excited to get lost in the wolrd. And that's what I always loved about our\
  \ trips. The possibility of going to unknown places, discovering unexpected things,\
  \ making connections with new people. On one of these family trips we were traveling\
  \ in the the state of Pernambuco and stopped at a small city called Pesqueira. My\
  \ father found out that a local merchant, was building a very peculiar house, a\
  \ castle. The town which has a little more than 66 thousand inhabitants and is proud\
  \ to be considered quiet, with the traditional sights of a small city became famous\
  \ after the man decided to build the castle to live in with his family. The building\
  \ measures about 2000 square meters and is about 40 meters high, took 20 years to\
  \ \"complete\" and resembles Gaud\xED's work in Barcelona both by the style of the\
  \ construction and by not yet being finalized. It's been about 10 years since I\
  \ was in town so you can imagine that it's very different from what I've known and\
  \ maybe 10 years from now it's different than, if you go to the city, you'll have\
  \ known. But it wasn't only the castle that I kept in my mind.  At the entrance\
  \ of the city we were stopped by a boy, about my age at the time, who offered us\
  \ in exchange for a few cents his local guide service. My parents did not usually\
  \ accept this type of service, but for some reason that day they accepted. And there\
  \ was the boy taking us to discover the city. He talked, talked, told such amusing\
  \ local stories, told stories of his family and the more he spoke, the more we liked\
  \ him. When we noticed the morning already gave us goodbye and the afternoon appeared\
  \ along with the end of the tour, it was time to say goodbye to our new friend.\
  \ My father asked him where he lived, so he could leave him at home. He gave us\
  \ the direction and there we went to take him back to his family which he had talked\
  \ about in the morning. The house where he lived was very simple, stood at the end\
  \ of a dirt road and we could see the paint peeling off the walls. A dark-haired,\
  \ dark-skinned woman came out of the house at the sound of the car engine to know\
  \ who was at her door. It was the boy's mother. She approached the window on my\
  \ mother's side and began to talk to her. They talked for a while and minutes later\
  \ her husband joined in the conversation. The conversation flowed so much that they\
  \ invited us to eat with them. We spent the rest of the day at their house. At the\
  \ end of the day my mother took the camera to record that moment. It was their first\
  \ picture. The woman asked her to send a copy for them to keep. So did my mother.\
  \ We even exchanged letters with them for a while, but lost contact. But what I\
  \ never lost was the memory of that day and the certainty that out there around\
  \ the world there are millions of new connections unexpected and unforgettable,\
  \ go for it!"
