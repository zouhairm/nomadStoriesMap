Text: "Since I was a kid I had this strong desire to see more, to learn more, to go\
  \ further and was probably that feeling inside of me that made that 4 years old\
  \ me to push my parents to enroll me early at school, which wasn\u2019t an easy\
  \ thing for my parents to do for sure, it required a lot of meetings, convincing\
  \ and tests to prove I could do it.  And don\u2019t get the wrong impression, I\
  \ wasn\u2019t an extrovert and talkative kid, but somehow, I knew what I want and\
  \ knew I could do it and at that age what people said didn\u2019t matter for me.\
  \ \n\nThat little girl grew up and as much as she learned about the world as much\
  \ that desire to explore increased inside her. It took her to University, to study\
  \ the only subject she could ever think about working with, International Relations.\
  \ When the first opportunity to go abroad appeared, she took it as fast as she could\
  \ and went for one semester studying in Spain.  A life-changing experience for her,\
  \ being surrounded by people from different countries and cultures, seeing the world\
  \ from a different point of view. And guess what, it could only have multiplied\
  \ her wanderlust mood. \n\nI had to go back home, to finish University and while\
  \ working to get my Bachelor degree I also started working in a very good company,\
  \ one of the best multinational freight forwarder companies in the world, for sure\
  \ a place where you can make a great career if you work hard and follow the steps\
  \ to the corporate success. I could even have a life traveling for work if I wait\
  \ and work more than everyone else. But that feeling inside me was once again telling\
  \ that I needed to do more and that was the moment when I applied for an international\
  \ internship program, this program had worldwide internship opportunities and my\
  \ aim, in the beginning, was to go back to Europe and that was where I started sending\
  \ curriculums until someone from the program organization contacted me and asked\
  \ if I would be interested in a job in Turkey, I said why not and after a few talks\
  \ and emails exchange I got the job and moved to Turkey after 2 weeks. \n\nThat\
  \ was when I took a leap to the unknown, I said yes to a job that would pay less\
  \ than I was already earning, I only knew it would be enough to survive in Turkey,\
  \ I didn\u2019t know where I was going to live, I didn\u2019t know much about the\
  \ country besides what we learn in school history books, I knew nothing about Turkish\
  \ language, I just knew a little about what the company wanted from me. I still\
  \ can\u2019t say exactly why I say yes to it, which were my reasons for jumping\
  \ on it, but I guess that \u201CIt\u2019s now or never\u201D feeling plus \u201C\
  we need a quick reply\u201D pressure that made me leave any fear behind, saying\
  \ yes to a new adventure and not listening to all the comments of people who say\
  \ that that shy little girl, wouldn\u2019t make it alone, wouldn\u2019t last one\
  \ month by herself so far away or those jokes saying someone would get my passport\
  \ and make me a prisoner, like the soap opera, about women\u2019s traffic that was\
  \ being shown at that time in Brazil.  \n\nTurkey received me with open arms, as\
  \ it always does for his visitors, it is the famous Turkish hospitality, according\
  \ to Turkish tradition, a stranger at one\u2019s doorstep is considered a guest\
  \ from God and it is taken as seriously as the huge Turkish patriotism. This warm\
  \ welcome together with Turkey beautiful ancient history, breathtaking natural landscapes,\
  \ turquoise paradisiacal beaches, fresh and tasty cuisine can melt your heart and\
  \ make you fall in love very quickly with this country. But that can be tricky,\
  \ just like that pretty perfect social media pictures, it is gonna take some time\
  \ and some not so pleasant moments so you can be able to carefully remove all those\
  \ layers of filters and see the real picture."
