Text: "After visiting a yellow fever cemetery in a forgotten port that smelled like\
  \ wet cardboard from an ancient paper mill in the armpit of the Florida pan handle.\
  \ This town   contained more ghastly spirts than people. Halloween was two months\
  \ away and I was inspired to feel eyes upon me that couldn\u2019t be seen. My Halloween\
  \ destination was non other than the Big Easy New Orleans! This was my second vacation\
  \ as a solo traveler and I had never been. I definitely was framiliar with Mardi\
  \ Gras and bourbon street and all that it entailed. I decided to drive 10 hours\
  \ through cotton fields, I walked the line through Johnny cash\u2019s hometown in\
  \ Arkansas passing Spanish moss riddled trees in Mississippi till I reached my destination.\
  \ It was a loft of 6 rooms above a 24 hour bar that had drag karaoke on Sunday nights.\
  \ I checked in and made my way to the street car that lazily rolled to the French\
  \ quarter. I started toward bourbon street but took a wrong left possibly right\
  \ I was entirely to enamored by the faint smell of andouille gumbo and flickering\
  \ gas lamps to notice. I ended up at a small coffee stand that had two items on\
  \ the menu coffee and fried doughnuts, If you have been to New Orleans you know\
  \ what I\u2019m talking about. I placed my order and traded a cigarette for directions\
  \ from one of the many homeless vagabonds to bourbon street in hopes of topless\
  \ women and beads thrown from balconies. As I passed through what I now know as\
  \ Jackson square I couldn\u2019t help but be drawn in by the mesmerizing local art\
  \ work that adorned its French gothic wrought iron fence and greeted by gypsy fortune\
  \ tellers posted up outside the cathedral doors to the Catholic Church. I stopped\
  \ and watched starving artist create their masterpieces in the midday autum sun\
  \ and the silent glares they gave to tourist snapping Instagram photos of the innermost\
  \ workings of a Pisces mind. After having coffee that was mellowed by chickory and\
  \ wind blown powder sugar on my black shorts from the beignets. I lit a cigarette\
  \ and took a few short steps around the park that contained Andrew Jackson\u2019\
  s statue. I was drawn in like a sailor to a sirens song. Only this song was sang\
  \ through brass instruments and jagged rocks were nothing more than cobble stone\
  \ streets no cars could navigate. I saw a 5 piece brass band and 10 bloodshot eyes\
  \ entertaining a small crowd for nothing more than small offerings of what passers\
  \ by had tucked in wallets for souvenirs and fish bowls full of cheap vodka. Playing\
  \ a song that\u2019s as old as Cab Calloway and Louis Armstrong and as new as The\
  \ Devil Makes Three or whichever transplant with courage and a voice that calls\
  \ New Orleans home for that period of existence. I knew every word to the song by\
  \ the time my two week residency expired. Yet each version had its own uniqueness\
  \ to never become a radio playing a forgotten song. The sun was setting and the\
  \ vampires were walking in the shadows to hear their stories told by tour guides\
  \ on horse drawn carriages. I could certainly feel the leers of forgotten souls\
  \ and their gentle sway to the beat of aspiring freestyle artist with microphones\
  \ in the back s-10 trucks on their way to 100,000 hits on Spotify. All the while\
  \ wondering which crow might be the one that Marie laveau transformed into as she\
  \ entrances every local and visitor with a love spell that hangs so heavily over\
  \ this sunken town that empties in the the Gulf of Mexico. My search for a street\
  \ that is world famous full of overpriced strip clubs and people packed from street\
  \ lamp to street lamp doing the Cupid shuffle has taken all day and most of the\
  \ evening! I did finally make my way to bourbon street on my way back to my room\
  \ that evening but that story is only worthy enough to be told by the hustlers asking\
  \ for cigarettes and any cash you may have to spare and a moment of your time!"
