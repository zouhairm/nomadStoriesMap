Text: "It always baffled me how in an airport full of foreign chatter, the words that\
  \ echoed past me always felt familiar and for the first nanosecond they were spoken,\
  \ I could almost fathom their meaning. It took time for me to realise the French\
  \ was directed at me, and before I could respond, I felt a hand pull my over-packed\
  \ suitcase (for someone who travels regularly for short periods, I have a habit\
  \ of packing unnecessary items) from my tired shaking hands and carry it down the\
  \ stairs. In that moment, my scepticism of the French and their racism towards my\
  \ skin-tone ceased to exist, and I wished I had worn my afro out like I had in Kampala\
  \ the week before instead of straightening my hair, which cost me to miss my flight\
  \ and forget to pack my winter coat during one of the coldest months of the year.\
  \ (It was Paris in sweet November and I spent the entirety of my trip without a\
  \ coat)\n\n\u201CSo you are missing the fellowship?\u201D my phone vibrated, it\
  \ was a text from Enoch who had been my \"internet society\" online teammate for\
  \ the past month. \u201CI am right behind you.\u201D I replied as my lower body\
  \ shifted in the \u201CHalle IX\u201D seat inside the UNESCO premises, and I could\
  \ feel flesh-eating butterflies feasting inside my stomach. The amount of pranks\
  \ Enoch and I pulled on each other, other participants and strangers from that moment\
  \ onwards is a story for another time, but needless to say a beautiful friendship\
  \ blossomed that day.\n\nEnoch, the group of twelve youth we managed to recruit,\
  \ and I walked for hours trying to find the \u201CLouvre\u201D museum from the metro\
  \ station using only google maps. If you use technology regularly like most youth\
  \ do, you know it is definitely not a tour guide replacement, but a tool for creating\
  \ great travel stories. When we finally arrived, and after learning the price for\
  \ one ticket to see the Mona Lisa and other paintings, we decided to take a stand\
  \ and staged a photoshoot sit in at the museum, because art is too pure for capitalism\
  \ to profit from! In other words, the majority of us were too broke after buying\
  \ souvenirs from gift stores along the way. \n\nIn an attempt to save the night,\
  \ we embarked on a journey to find the best night club in Paris. By our standards\
  \ \u201Cbest\u201D was any club where we could dance to afro beats. When we finally\
  \ found the perfect Africano club on google maps, we must have passed the location\
  \ at least seventeen times before we ran into locals who explained in poor Frenglish\
  \ that no clubs were open on Tuesdays and the particular one we were looking for,\
  \ which google swore was \u201Cnow open\u201D, had been closed for a very long time!\n\
  \nAfter a long night of walking, taking selfies with beautiful architecture, singing,\
  \ deep conversations and getting nowhere, we decided to head back to our hotel in\
  \ Cambronne; only we were in an area that we could not pronounce, did not know the\
  \ way back to the metro station, did not speak a word of French, had no money left\
  \ on us and most of us had forgotten to buy return tickets. \n\nWhen we finally\
  \ arrived two hours later to the nearest metro station, which should have been a\
  \ twenty five minute walk, we had the stupidly brilliant idea to cheat the metro\u2019\
  s automatic sliding gates by going two or even three at a time. Despite the injuries\
  \ and the stares we received, we managed to get all twelve of us inside using only\
  \ four tickets. If anyone ever asks however, I will solemnly swear that we were\
  \ enacting the platform 9 \xBE scene from Harry Potter and the Sorcerer\u2019s stone.\n\
  \nOn the last day of starving, I found a nearby restaurant which sold Halal food.\
  \ Enoch left without saying goodbye, but he left a notepad at the hotel\u2019s reception\
  \ for my journaling. \n\nParis was not the city of lights and definitely not the\
  \ city of love. If anything, my Paris was the city of friendship, hustle and kind\
  \ strangers. I still have an unused metro ticket."
