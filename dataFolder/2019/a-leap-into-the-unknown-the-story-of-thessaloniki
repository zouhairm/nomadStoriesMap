Text: "Routine is poison, my friend. Getting started, changing your routine is simply\
  \ the fuel for your soul. And your soul needs movement. Here, try it, make just\
  \ 10 miles left or right from your base point and your soul will tell you: \"Hey\
  \ mate, thank you for taking me for a walk, it was very pleasant and necessary...\"\
  \n\nIf you can stop just for a moment and think about what is happening over the\
  \ sky at this moment. Thousands of people traveling, levitating in a different type\
  \ of airplanes in a sitting position, watching some movies, either asleep or listening\
  \ to the same music choice as I am listening to right now - Pearl Jam...\n\nI'm\
  \ directing my thoughts here to destinations that you may have not visited yet,\
  \ and you have dreamed about those places your whole life. After two years spent\
  \ on the Islands of the beautiful Carribean,  Serbia is my base town once again.\
  \ Those memories triggered the quest for the new adventure that is waiting for me...\
  \ \n\nIt is the right time for me to make a new move...\n\nI recently traveled.\
  \ Short but sweet, to one unfamiliar place...I took my backpack and made a decision\
  \ - My direction is going to be South. \n   \nMy dear colleague professor told me\
  \ once the following: \"The philosophy is always in the standpoint of the question.\
  \ The question is its beginning and its end. When one or more questions appear in\
  \ front of you then scratch at least it's beginning. In a search for the answers,\
  \ contact them right away...\u201C \n\"Whom to contact\" - I asked?\". \"The philosophers\"\
  \ - he replied...   \nSo, last weekend I went to the very beginning. My destination\
  \ \u2013 Thessaloniki in Greece. Meeting with Hellens. Shortly after I had a brief\
  \ consultation with wise Aristotle, and with Alexander the Great. \n\nWhat a magnificent\
  \ place!\n\nThe statue of Alexander the Great and his faithful horse Bukefal...\
  \ I studied the documents and watched the film about this warrior, but standing\
  \ here at this locality was a completely different feeling. When I touched the shield\
  \ with my own hand, on which the snakes and other symbols of the Greek gods were\
  \ engraved, immediately I felt that ancient warrior connection. I pictured all those\
  \ brave warriors in many battles. I heard screams,  horses and elephants, Persians,\
  \ sounds of swords and arrows, and at the end, I remembered Alexanders death. What\
  \ an honor!\n\nLater I visited the Serbian military cemetery in Zejtinlik where\
  \ the largest number of Serbian brave soldiers graves are located, those who were\
  \ killed in the breakthroughs of the Thessaloniki front in the First World War...\
  \ \n\nThessaloniki is one of those towns that takes you at first glance. The leisureliness\
  \ of the Greeks, unburdened by the look and ease of living, left on me a very powerful\
  \ impression. I was walking by the Thessaloniki pear and suddenly, I started to\
  \ feel the same - calm and relieved. The mixture of an Ancient age and life in the\
  \ modern presence. I found out that The Greek anthem, for example, has 158 paragraphs\
  \ and is officially the longest anthem in the world. They say that there is almost\
  \ no Greek who knows the words of the anthem to the very end. Many things have changed\
  \ today in modern Greece, but universal principles, moral values, ethics discipline,\
  \ and healthy spirit, is embedded deep in who they are. The monuments of their philosophers,\
  \  teachers, remind them of that at almost every step.\n\nI continued to explore\
  \ this beautiful town, and yes, I have a message for you...\n\nThere are so many\
  \ beautiful places on this planet. Explore, feel, connect. After all, we need to\
  \ get acquainted, we have only one life, and this is certainly not a call to spend\
  \ it as a tree in one place. \n\nWatch the miles as they melt behind you. Have fun\
  \ with the passengers you meet, and your soul will definitely tell you at the end\
  \ of each of your adventures: \"Hey, my friend, thank you for taking me to this\
  \ great walk. It was a really nice  pleasant and unknown experience.\u201C"
