Text: "I have always had a complicated relationship with my father. Even though we\
  \ had lived under the same roof for over 17 years, I don\u2019t think we have ever\
  \ had a conversation. While he covered\_the responsibilities of a father diligently,\
  \ providing us with food, clothing, shelter, an education there was never any nurturing.\
  \ No attending PTAs, swim meets, no word of praise out of the man.\_\n\nEven though\
  \ it had been years since I moved out there was never even a formal greeting or\
  \ an inquiry into my well being. When we did speak it was through my mom and I was\
  \ sick of this quasi-relationship. I hoped that the damage was not too deep-rooted\
  \ to repair.\_\n\nIt must be clear by now I didn't know my father. So on a long\
  \ shot to mending fences, I asked him if he\u2019d like to take a trip with me up\
  \ to the Western Ghats. No reason, just a road trip. The conditions were clear,\
  \ it would be just the two of us and I would be driving. I was hoping it would be\
  \ the start of a healing process for both of us.\n\nOur trip began at the break\
  \ of dawn. Fog covering the road ahead. Now and then there would be a clearing of\
  \ the haze and we would see freckles of dust being lit up by the rays of the sun.\
  \ Trees lined either side of our path which was barely wide enough for a single\
  \ car to pass through yet this was one of the main routes most people traveled every\
  \ day to go up the hills and to the plains.\_\n\nI had been driving for almost two\
  \ hours and I noticed that we had passed no cars. Remarkable since this was one\
  \ of the busiest roads in town. Mind you, in all the time that had passed we had\
  \ not exchanged over\_10 words between us and most of them had to do with, \u201C\
  turn the volume down\u201D, \u201Cwatch out for the potholes\u201D. In hindsight,\
  \ being a little lost in my thoughts that day was probably the best thing I\u2019\
  ve done in my life.\_\n\nNot a second after I went through every pothole on the\
  \ road I had a flat tire. I couldn\u2019t have picked a better spot for the car\
  \ to breakdown if I tried. There was just enough space to the side of the road for\
  \ us to park the car and change tires. A thick branch of greens hanging over us\
  \ to shade us from what little sun was coming through. It was barely 7 but I could\
  \ already feel it would be a hot day. I took the tools from the boot while my dad\
  \ went a little way mumbling under his breath about my driving skills.\_\n\nI struggled\
  \ for about 2 minutes with no success. I look back to see my father, his back against\
  \ one of the tree trunks, a cigarette dangling from his lips, and eyes lost in the\
  \ majestic beauty of the valley below. I look at my phone and realize I\u2019ll\
  \ sooner get in touch with god with my prayers than have help reach me soon.\_\n\
  \nI call out to my father, \u201CAbbu, can you please lend a hand?\u201D. I was\
  \ expecting anger, a dismissal or silent compliance but what I heard in return was\
  \ \u201CDo you hate me?\u201D.\_\uFEFF\uFEFF\n\nI was taken aback but replied as\
  \ honestly as I could. \u201CMaybe, I\u2019m sorry\u201D.\_\n\n\u201CNo, it is I\
  \ who have failed you\u201D.\n\nAlthough he had made promises he would be a more\
  \ loving father than grandpa was to him, he only knew one way of parenting. He said\
  \ he wanted to be a better father and for the first time in over 2 minutes I felt\
  \ myself breathe. He talked for hours wiping the tears streaming down his face and\
  \ occasionally holding my hand as if gathering the courage to go on. All the while\
  \ we were standing there not a single car passed by the road. If it did, we did\
  \ not notice. As far as we were concerned we were on the loneliest road in India\
  \ and I was meeting my father for the first time."
