Text: "When I recommend Phuket to people that are going to Thailand, I am faced by\
  \ looks of disbelief and doubt. \nI don\u2019t blame them as most people associate\
  \ the island\u2019s name with full moon parties, lady boys and beaches full of European\
  \ tourists.\nWell, there is that, but there is much more to it than those things!\n\
  Living in London, when I go on holiday I tend to choose places that can provide\
  \ me with relaxation and adventure in equal doses. \nCape Panwa encapsulated both\
  \ perfectly.\n\nThe area is quieter than word famous Patong and it hosts the Muslim\
  \ minority in what is otherwise a mainly Buddhist country. \nThe multi-culturalism\
  \ of the area proved to be an added bonus: the call to prayer by the local muezzin\
  \ would become one with the soft beats of the bar\u2019s stereo creating a unique\
  \ melody; we would exchange broad smiles with the families sitting out on the porches\
  \ of their houses breaking the Ramadan fast at night, while we rocketed our bicycles\
  \ downhill to the local eatery for fish taken straight out of water tanks from the\
  \ river, in front of our eyes; while their restrain from drinking water in the heat\
  \ and humidity, even while at strenuous work, filled me with humbleness and respect.\n\
  \nDays would alternate between stillness: reading, plunging in the pool, sipping\
  \ local Thai gin (yes, we are far from good old England, but the stuff is good),\
  \ eating delicious and fiery spicy food; and action-packed ones which were testing\
  \ the resort\u2019s staff that would worry about us. \nThey had got accustomed at\
  \ seeing me and Ralu cycling at night with no lights, but the day we took the kayaks\
  \ their blood pressure jumped to the stars. \nWe left the resort early in the morning,\
  \ managed to find a way out through the mangroves dotting the lagoon and got out\
  \ into the open sea. \nOur first stop was a tiny deserted island perfect for a swim,\
  \ a selfie and catching breath again. \nHunger stroke in though, so we headed towards\
  \ a bigger island, further away from the coast of Cape Panwa, that had a resort\
  \ and therefore food on offer. \nAfter eating an amount of food that would have\
  \ probably fed the Oxford-Cambridge rowing teams, in 40 C, my energies started to\
  \ vanish, like our destination which was further than our eyes could stretch to.\
  \ \nHey pronto I found a fisherman who didn\u2019t speak a word of English, but\
  \ that represented the only fatigueless way of returning to our base: by putting\
  \ the two kayaks on board and jetting away without spilling one more drop of sweat\
  \ (I would still sweat from the mind-blowing heat!). \nThankfully his nephew had\
  \ decided to hang out with grandpa that week and knew enough English to be the interpreter\
  \ of my negotiation efforts. \nDid I mention we only had a certain amount of cash?\
  \ We did. Luckily it was enough though! \nNeither grandpa or the kid knew where\
  \ we were going exactly, but this would never stop me in believing they would get\
  \ us there.\n\nThe roaring of the Japan made engine cut through the silence of the\
  \ empty resort, apart from the German honeymooners that were woken up by it and\
  \ watched us in disbelief while we were getting out of the boat in what the low\
  \ tide had made a mud lagoon. \n\nThe Thai female staff ran to hug us saying the\
  \ very reassuring: \u201CWe thought you had got lost or died!\u201D. \nI didn\u2019\
  t have the heart to tell them that it was my second time only on a kayak (the previous\
  \ time being 15 years earlier) and that the second rower was a kayak-virgin.\n\n\
  So, try new things (maybe kayaking or maybe not), go to Phuket and see it with your\
  \ eyes; you never know what life has in store."
