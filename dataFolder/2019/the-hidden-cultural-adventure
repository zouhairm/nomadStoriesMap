Text: "The day that i decided to book this trip, was very spontaneous. The friend\
  \ that came with me was one that I hadn't spoken to for a year! We planned to go\
  \ to Germany, then we narrowed that down and went to Hamburg. It was set, we were\
  \ flying from the lovely airport stanstead, and we hadn't yet decided on how to\
  \ get there. However a coach is always a 'reliable' option. The coach from Bristol\
  \ into London, and back out to the airport was booked, and so was the hostel ( I\
  \ thought that anyway ). We embarked onto the Megabus, my friend Joel was on 0 hours\
  \ of sleep after stocking shelves in a supermarket the night before. Separated in\
  \ the first coach journey we were eager to sit next to each other on the second\
  \ leg of our journey. As we managed to succesfully bag ourselves the luxurious seats\
  \ of the more spacious National Express Coaches, we had constant conversations.\
  \ At around two and a half hours before departure, i had a random headache occur\
  \ at the back of my mind. It was the thoughts flowing through my head and trying\
  \ to burst their way through. They did manage to break through, and the question\
  \ that was trying to peak out was all about the hostel that we had booked. I had\
  \ a feeling as a seventeen year old, that i wasn't allowed in the hostel, this was\
  \ only what i had heard from other people, but as it was a spontaneous trip, when\
  \ we booked i didn't question much. We phoned the German hostel from England just\
  \ to double check, and this is where the male on the end of the line was shocked\
  \ to think we thought i would be allowed in and said that their is no hostel in\
  \ Germany that will allow me to stay. \n\nAfter twelve to fifteen hours of travelling\
  \ our delirious minds reacted in a very, looking back on it, funny way. We obviously\
  \ panicked and our instant thought was to book an air bnb. We pondered through the\
  \ possible locations that were available to book in the center of Hamburg. I said\
  \ to Joel, just book that one, whilst pointing at a very cheap central location.\
  \ However, Joel's self minded phone had other ideas, deciding to turn itself off,\
  \ not connect to internet as well as have the very useful feature of forgetting\
  \ all of his card details that were previously saved onto his phone. We had managed\
  \ to book the accommodation so all of the needless weight was temporarily lifted\
  \ off our shoulders. The flight felt as short as this sentence. even though it was\
  \ an hour and 20 minutes. My thoughts were focused on putting my heavy backpack\
  \ down and laying down myself. Then we landed, straight onto a U bahn, and off to\
  \ sleep! But loud, eventful footballers from the city were on a night out, we quickly\
  \ featured on their social media accounts, flicking peoples ears. The maps directed\
  \ us to the Reeperbahn, and we were indeed close to the very much needed bed. So\
  \ Joel phoned the host up, to see where the flat was, 'where only two other people\
  \ were living'. \n\nAfter we had finally managed to get into the flat, the host\
  \ hadn't seen the booking and got their non English speaking mum, that was about\
  \ ninety to show us around, we were very relieved. Whilst putting our bags away,\
  \ we heard talking, so we decided to see what it was. The last thing I thought it\
  \ would be, came out of the bedroom, it was young male called Monti. He was kind,\
  \ as well as drunk. We quickly were introduced to the 15 other friends he had round\
  \ for his birthday. After five minutes of speaking, they invited us clubbing. Me\
  \ and Joel, both wearing a piece of Mont's clothing to look \"more German\", embarked\
  \ in this event. Me being 17, was hoping to get in, which obviously wasn't going\
  \ to happen. I then got rejected at the door of the club, walked back down the strip\
  \ to our accommodation. I led there, thinking of the past hours, non stop hysterically\
  \ laughing!"
