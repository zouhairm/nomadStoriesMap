Text: "New Orleans is a city of many faces - or masks, since we are talking about\
  \ the capital of Mardi Gras celebrations. It is an old-world city full of charm,\
  \ with its iron-wrought balconies and quaintly painted doors. It is a vibrant city,\
  \ with the infamous Bourbon Street boasting margarita stands every ten steps, and\
  \ blues bars bustling with sweaty dancers and smooth singers. But it is also a mysterious\
  \ city, with a past saturated in hoodoo, mysticism and voodoo queens. \n\nI first\
  \ set foot in New Orleans in 2007, not knowing what exactly to expect from a city\
  \ that I'd only seen in movies. Our first few days were a whirlwind of walking tours,\
  \ sightseeing, to-go drinks, and shopping for kitsch. But I wanted to dig deeper,\
  \ and see a glimpse of that mysterious New Orleans that I believed still existed.\
  \ \n\nOne afternoon, I peeled myself away from my little group and went in search\
  \ of the unknown. I happened to stumble upon a shop touting voodoo wares - potions,\
  \ poultices, and packets of various natures. Excited, I went inside. The shop was\
  \ dim but well-organized, with sections for books, dolls, herbs, and other items\
  \ for which their uses were unknown to me. They lady behind the counter welcomed\
  \ me warmly, and invited me to look around the shop.\n\n\"Do you know much about\
  \ the history of voodoo?\" the woman asked as I was paying for a few random purchases.\
  \ \n\n\"Only what I've seen on TV,\" I replied.\n\n\"Well, we have a small museum\
  \ set up in the back, if you'd like to see,\" she informed me.\n\nThe fee to enter\
  \ was minimal, and so I agreed to check it out. It was a two-room exhibit, with\
  \ used poppet dolls, artworks, and hand-written books that I found fascinating.\
  \ I stayed for a short time, peering around and reading the information presented.\
  \ When I emerged from the exhibit room, a man in a slightly rumpled white shirt\
  \ was chatting with the lady at the counter, and he turned to greet me.\n\n\"What\
  \ did you think?\" he asked, beaming. He looked like a kindly man, with a bushy\
  \ white beard and a twinkle in his eye.\n\n\"So interesting!\" I exclaimed. \"I\
  \ had no idea that voodoo was still practiced so heavily around here.\"\n\n\"Very\
  \ much so,\" he replied. He introduced himself as the proprietor of the store, and\
  \ told me that he lived in the apartments above the shop where he created a vast\
  \ majority of the items found on the store shelves. I introduced myself, telling\
  \ him I was a first-time visitor from Canada, and let him know how much I enjoyed\
  \ his shop.\n\n\"Would like something personally created for you?\" he asked. And\
  \ although I probably shouldn't have, I agreed to accompany him upstairs and have\
  \ a gris-gris bag made in my honour. \n\nHis apartment was sunny and pleasant, and\
  \ I didn't feel unsafe at all. He motioned for me to sit at his kitchen table, and\
  \ he began to bustle about gathering supplies. I looked to my side and was momentarily\
  \ stunned to see a large, white snake curled up in a cloth basket in an aquarium\
  \ against the wall. It seemed to be looking at me.\n\n\"That's my albino python,\"\
  \ the practitioner proudly told me. I nodded politely, unsure of what to make of\
  \ this giant snake with its soul-searching gaze.\n\nAs the man proceeded to create\
  \ my gris-gris bag - designed to help me financially as per my request - we had\
  \ a pleasant chat about my visit thus far to New Orleans, how I felt about the city,\
  \ and a little more about the history of voodoo and its culture. The entire affair\
  \ was relaxed, and I felt completely at ease with the old man. \n\nNow I'm not recommending\
  \ you follow strangers into their apartments on a regular basis, but in this case,\
  \ the unexpected adventure had a safe and enjoyable outcome. My gris-gris bag has\
  \ not yet made me millions, but it has made me a wonderful memory of a favourite\
  \ city, a warm-hearted voodoo practitioner, and a steely-eyed albino python."
