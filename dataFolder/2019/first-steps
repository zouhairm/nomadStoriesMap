Text: "As an inhabitant and explorer of New York City\u2019s endless grid of streets,\
  \ there was no doubt that I loved to walk; a summer respite to the Peruvian Andes\
  \ a few years prior had first confirmed it.  But never had I earned the title of\
  \ being a backpacker. Never had I strapped all things necessary for survival onto\
  \ my back and traipsed day after day through the wild and merciless; and despite\
  \ the fearless facade I presented to those around me, I wasn\u2019t entirely convinced\
  \ that this particular solo adventure was something of which I was truly capable.\
  \ In hindsight that was likely the appeal.\n\nAs the cruel winter days gradually\
  \ softened so too did the overwhelming sense of uncertainty that had grasped me\
  \ throughout the months prior, during which I\u2019d repeatedly grappled with a\
  \ raft of near impossible decisions, the answers to which oddly no longer even seemed\
  \ voluntary. The sunshine with which I was greeted at the San Diego airport felt\
  \ warm and welcoming on my bare skin, and the fragrant air filled my lungs in a\
  \ way that they hadn\u2019t been since I\u2019d last seen the ocean, almost exactly\
  \ two years prior. I felt calm and content, which I hadn\u2019t expected, and can\
  \ really only account to having finally truly accepted the impending unknown deep\
  \ within my being. \n\nMy pack, which was to be an almost permanent extension of\
  \ my unlikely figure, was as unprepared for the following day as I was physically,\
  \ the bright blue fabric still clean and unmarred by the many miles of sand and\
  \ desert sun to come. Similarly, my legs were a perfect shade of pale, having been\
  \ carefully hidden away in tights and boots from the cold winds of the east that\
  \ had tunnelled through those lifeless streets along which I\u2019d scurried, and\
  \ worn away at my usually tenacious spirit. I would spend the afternoon upending\
  \ it\u2019s carefully chosen contents and repacking them strategically, making sure\
  \ that I hadn\u2019t forgotten anything and completing the load with a crushing\
  \ seven litres of water - I hoped it would be enough.\n\nEarly the following morning,\
  \ from a seat in a stranger\u2019s SUV, I studied the Californian sun\u2019s path\
  \ over the I-8, rising higher and higher in the hazy blue sky, casting it\u2019\
  s peachy glow wide over the sagebrush covered hills that now surrounded me. It was\
  \ the first of many sunrises that I would witness in the coming months, and it is\
  \ unlikely to be one that I ever forget, so captivated I was. My stomach niggled\
  \ me, the last supper that I\u2019d forced down earlier refusing to sit well - perhaps\
  \ my body\u2019s final attempt to talk my mind out of what it longed for - but logic\
  \ soon reminded me that there was nothing left to lose. There were no apartments,\
  \ or belongings or jobs at stake, all having been forfeited over the weeks prior,\
  \ leaving me with a sense of freedom that only increased as my journey progressed.\
  \ \n\nSoon after 7 we pulled into a dusty shoulder and the vehicle went silent.\
  \ Four friends slid out from the back seat together, their sunglasses nestled into\
  \ place to combat the sun, already fierce in its position high in the sky. I soon\
  \ followed, tugging my base layer up over my head and stuffing it into my pack,\
  \ before swinging it\u2019s heavy load onto my torso. Alone. \n\nI snapped my hip-belt\
  \ into place, took a deep breath, looked up at the battered corrugated metal wall\
  \ just ahead and started out along the worn track leading up the sandy hill towards\
  \ it. The next time I glanced up from my feet it wasn\u2019t the wall that I saw,\
  \ but instead the fabled monument that marked the beginning. As I reached out and\
  \ touched the tallest of its three concrete pillars a grin crept over my face and\
  \ I felt myself stand a little taller in my brand new shoes; my stomach finally\
  \ settled. I stood for a second, and then I turned and strode onwards, into the\
  \ unknown, towards the biggest dreams I\u2019d dared to dream and the even bigger\
  \ fears that accompanied them. 2,650 miles to go I whispered."
