Text: "Our guide from a Karen village packs his backpack with just some clothes, clips\
  \ the machete onto his belt, but unfortunately forgets to take his water bottle.\n\
  \nIt is a hot midday and we are hiking upwards along thin trails through banana\
  \ and pineapple plantations to reach a dense bamboo forest. A loud, crackling engine\
  \ noise is heard - behind us someone is making his way with a scooter through a\
  \ hiking path which is rather impractical for a vehicle. The driver stops for a\
  \ short chat with our guide, Win, and then disappears into the depths of the forest.\
  \ Win explains that the man is on his way hunting for a cow as an offering for the\
  \ feast of the Chinese Lunar New Year, which is also celebrated by the Lahu hill\
  \ tribe where we are going to.\n\nAfter wandering around the jungle for a long while,\
  \ we reach a bamboo hut with water supply. Weirdly, everywhere around are empty\
  \ plastic bottles. Win rummages through the vessels and sniffs at them. A short\
  \ while later he hands me one and asks: \"Does it smell for gasoline?\" The pungent\
  \ scent immediately hits my nose. He looks questioningly at me: \"And?\" \"Yes,\
  \ gasoline. Pretty intense.\" \"Ok. Unfortunately, I do not smell it.\" Astonished\
  \ by this fact, we offer him one of our bottles before he decides to use one of\
  \ those around. Several hours more of hiking in the dense jungle and we roam through\
  \ another banana plantation when Win shows us the Lahu Village on the opposite hill.\
  \ Before we enter the village, he pokes the crown of a papaya tree with a long stick\
  \ until one falls down, which I catch with some luck. Thereupon Win shortly tackles\
  \ the topic of football. \u201CYou Europeans are very good at catching balls\u201D\
  , he says humorously.\n\nIn this traditional tribe village where modern civilisation\
  \ is only recognised by some solar panels to provide electricity for the settlement\
  \ itself and a handful of teenagers with smartphones, chickens and dogs accompany\
  \ our walk towards the final destination. There we meet again the man from earlier\
  \ today, who in the meantime apparently killed a cow and is preparing it for the\
  \ evening banquet. Two women are making traditional sticky rice. One firmly holds\
  \ a bucket while the other stomps vigorously with a bamboo trunk into it in a repetitive\
  \ rhythm. Full of laughter, Win joins, grabs the trunk and stomps happily onto the\
  \ dough in the bucket, too.\n\nLater, before food is served we get a kind of liquor\
  \ pickled with a special root. Cumbersome, Win  tries to translate the name of it.\
  \ He decides to describe the meaning of it as \"like a hit from a bull\" - and after\
  \ a few glasses which we all drink with pleasure, this description perfectly applies.\n\
  As the sky is covered with millions of stars, but no moon can be seen, we finally\
  \ decide to attend the celebration on the central village square, where almost all\
  \ of the villagers have gathered to pursue a special ritual around four huge bamboo\
  \ trees which are festooned with all sorts of little things. In the light of small\
  \ fire pits, women of all ages dance rhythmically around this bamboo altar and sing\
  \ while a male voice tells stories in the Lahu language through speakers. Several\
  \ young men with drums join the circle and begin to play a wild but rhythmic tune,\
  \ which creates an atmosphere that deeply captivates us. Everything mingles into\
  \ a spiritual, trance-like experience under the influence of that liquor we drank.\n\
  \nOverwhelmed by the ongoing trance, we try to regain ground under our feet and\
  \ sneak away from the ritual, which lasts all night until early morning. After vanishing\
  \ from the light of the hearths into the darkness, we rediscover the full magic\
  \ of the most magnificent starry sky we have seen, lie down near our hut without\
  \ any sense of time and space and drift into the world of dreams.\n\nThe next morning\
  \ we are waken up with a friendly smile from Win, who already has prepared our breakfast\
  \ - scrambled eggs, sticky rice and of course the papaya, which I have caught the\
  \ day before."
