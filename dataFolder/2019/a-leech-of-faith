Text: "The canopy cast cut-outs of bright brilliant yellow stars onto the damp primary\
  \ forest floor. We'd been walking for 2 hours, slogging through the moist foliage\
  \ and unforgiving terrain, working towards a habitable campsite. Nestled deep in\
  \ the dense rainforests of Taman Negarah, renowned for its temperamental weather\
  \ and dramatic local wildlife, we came seeking an escape from the banal existence\
  \ of Singapore's humdrum milieu. We traded our Air force ones for hiking boots and\
  \ exchanged our cushy queen sized beds for olive green hammocks. The thought of\
  \ going camping in the oldest rainforest in the world was daunting at first but\
  \ heavier hands prevailed and before we could shout \"let's not\", we had already\
  \ begun our unceremonious charge through the flora.\n\nThe group of eight that i\
  \ was travelling with all had varying degrees of experience with camping. Being\
  \ Singaporean and going through 2 years of conscription military service, most of\
  \ us relished the idea of being able to dive into the wilderness once more. Except\
  \ this time, it would be on our own terms, away from sputtering warren officers,\
  \ and field rations that tasted like hot trash on a good day. It was only when we\
  \ were in the thick of it did we have second thoughts, and by that time, we could\
  \ only justify our decision by using buzz words like 'character building' and 'Prav\
  \ stop pissing into the fire'. It was undoubtedly a trip of firsts, and we were\
  \ basking in our sweat and muddied clothing like only a group of people resigned\
  \ to their fate could.\n\nAfter the initial shock of the jungle washed over us,\
  \ and we came to terms with the speed and tenacity of the leeches and the spiders\
  \ that we shared a home with, we began setting up camp in a little clearing by a\
  \ stream. The first order of business was to set up our individual shelters. We\
  \ started by draping a tarp over a line stretched between two trees and then hanging\
  \ a hammock directly underneath the roof. Once we had settled our own accommodations,\
  \ we headed over to the communal area where we set up the communal shelter. A three\
  \ by four-metre long plastic tarp that we secured to some trees, under which we\
  \ placed our helinox chairs, centered around a roaring fire that we spent three\
  \ hours collecting firewood for. Under this polyester roof was where we spent most\
  \ of our time during the trip. We engaged in mundane activities like conversation,\
  \ cooking what i can only describe as gourmet aeroplane food, and throwing tiny\
  \ twigs into my friend Subras beard and seeing if they\u2019d stick(they didn\u2019\
  t). Yeap, there wasn't much for ways of entertainment in the dense jungles of Taman\
  \ Negarah. We had to leave the N64's behind in place of the much less fun, but much\
  \ more imperative, drinking water. Perhaps the only thing we didn't compromise on,\
  \ was refreshments. All 120 cans of Copenhagen's finest lager, painstakingly lugged,\
  \ through Malaysia's finest thicket. We spent the next two nights drinking until\
  \ our stomachs were filled and our hearts were full and the next two mornings nursing\
  \ hangovers over diluted coffee.\nThere really is nothing like the great outdoors."
