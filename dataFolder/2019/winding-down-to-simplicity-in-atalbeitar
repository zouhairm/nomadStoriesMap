Text: "\u201CSure, it\u2019s beautiful, but I could never live here,\u201D I announced,\
  \ after the beer bubbles had helped alleviate some of the car sickness acquired\
  \ en route.  The mountains on the other side of the gorge were breathtaking indeed,\
  \ a protection from the outside world, dotted with oaks and baby pink blossoming\
  \ almonds. It was a late afternoon in late April, with just the right combination\
  \ of hazy sunshine and soft wind that makes you grateful to be alive. Faint, dreamlike\
  \ bells jingled down the valley.\n\n\u201CJos\xE9 and his goats,\u201D said our\
  \ host, a friend\u2019s mother we\u2019d never met before.\n\nEvelyn\u2019s terrace,\
  \ located some 200 metres above the entrance to Atalbeitar, has a meditative, million-dollar\
  \ view. Still, I promised myself that I would never make the sinuous journey here\
  \ again, not for any amount of money. Lost somewhere between Granada and Malaga,\
  \ Atalbeitar exists down a steep, dead end road, about 40 kilometres and nearly\
  \ an hour off the highway. It\u2019s part of La Alpujarra, an area of outstanding\
  \ beauty, in a Parque Natural in the foothills of Spain\u2019s Sierra Nevada mountains.\
  \ A veritable hikers\u2019 paradise.\n\nWe\u2019d come to Evelyn\u2019s for lunch,\
  \ making the detour on our Andalusian road trip on which we were looking for our\
  \ place, that magical, still undefined place we\u2019d all choose to call home.\
  \ For the past two months, my husband, our seven-year-old daughter and I had been\
  \ in a state of nomadic flow, camping out on beaches or in our crammed station wagon,\
  \ and feasting on more types of olives then we could ever have imagined. The infamous\
  \ 80-euro pizza lunch in Puerto Banus, our run-in with the police in La Herradura,\
  \ and even Sophia\u2019s jellyfish sting had all been calmly washed away by the\
  \ intoxicating scent of orange blossoms in the sunshine.\n\nOver quiche and salad,\
  \ Evelyn explained that the area was populated by a mix of local Spaniards and foreigners.\
  \ She, herself, had come down south from Paris in the 70s, and finally built this\
  \ beautiful house in the early 2000s. Like most of the extranjeros, the foreigners\
  \ who call the Alpujarra home, our friend\u2019s mother is a quirky, resilient soul\
  \ with a bit of a rebellious streak. \n\nHuffing away, with a cigarette in one hand\
  \ and her cane in the other, she gave us a tour of the hilly village \u2013 a territory\
  \ that a young pair of legs can easily cover in less than ten minutes. Without knocking\
  \ we entered the Montero family home, which also acts as the village art gallery\
  \ and historical museum. Here, Gabriel and his sons welcomed us like much-awaited\
  \ old friends.\n\nIn loud, approximate English, the brothers told us that the area\
  \ was first inhabited by the Moors, who ruled Northern Africa and Al-Andalus, about\
  \ one thousand years ago. In the 1500s, the Muslim leaders of Granada surrendered\
  \ to the Christian armies and flocked here, to the mountains, building homes, agricultural\
  \ terraces and an irrigation system still used today. Most of the house foundations\
  \ are original, and Atalbeitar remains one of the best-preserved villages in the\
  \ area. It is also one of the few with a name of Arab origin, Harat al Beitar, translated\
  \ to mean \u2018the veterinarian\u2019s neighbourhood\u2019. Back then, travellers\
  \ heading to Granada with fish and supplies from the coast would stop here to let\
  \ their animals rest after their gruelling trek over rugged terrain.\n\nMy family\
  \ and I had originally planned on leaving Atalbeitar that evening, but with the\
  \ help of vivid hand gestures and lots of local wine, our new friends convinced\
  \ us to spend the night. We were invited to a concert the next evening, and to a\
  \ barbecue party the day after that, and so our lunch date turned into a ten-day\
  \ stint where everything flowed, like the village fountains. Over the next week\
  \ we rambled down old Medieval trails, part of which make up Europe\u2019s GR7 route,\
  \ excited by the smells of almonds, thyme and lavender. We met locals who, like\
  \ us, sought a simple, happy life surrounded by good neighbours.\n\nThere were about\
  \ 20 permanent residents the first time we visited Atalbeitar. Now, there are 23\
  \ of us."
