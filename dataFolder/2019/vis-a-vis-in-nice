Text: "It was a morning of the windy Cote d'Azur December that I left Hostel Meyerbeer\
  \ in Nice after lamenting my singleness to Raul, the hostel's receptionist. He teased\
  \ me about my preference for locals over travelers, and suggested some bars on the\
  \ beach where I might meet French men. Plumping my red lips, I walked down the street\
  \ to the Apollo fountain of Place Massena. The immense statue had a styrofoam quality\
  \ to it, like the Getty Kouros or the marble replica of David in Piazzale Michelangelo.\
  \ Its Greek subject matter imbued it with an artistic nobility, but its lack of\
  \ the cracks and dullness of age betrayed its modernity. \n\nThe finely-blended\
  \ rain of the previous day had ceased. I glimpsed a young man who looked like the\
  \ Alessandro I had been messaging. He was sitting on the edge of the fountain in\
  \ a yellow bomber jacket that did not match his blue sweater. His face was interesting\
  \ and animated. He was the perfect example of the French type of plain, the baguette\
  \ type. The dimpled chin and moony eyes contrasted strongly with his rather lumpy\
  \ nose and wide lips, which stretched into a tight smile when I asked him about\
  \ the Ni\xE7ard dialect. I was not taken by him immediately. But as it was my last\
  \ day on the Riviera, I thought I would wander the streets in the Vieille Ville\
  \ and venture to the castle to drink in the view of the Bay of Nice with some company.\n\
  \nAlessandro was a knowledgable tour guide. He would comment on World War II monuments\
  \ and movies that had been filmed in the Palais de Justice Law Court. Presently,\
  \ we came upon a bookstore that reminded me of an old winery. It was here that he\
  \ revealed his aspirations to enlist in La Marine Royale. Alessandro spoke in a\
  \ broken string of English words \u2014 a staccato, cut and paste kind of accent.\
  \ As he spoke, I felt him vibrating with appetite, and not for the truffle pasta\
  \ we would have for lunch nor the ros\xE9 we would sip before he brushed his lips\
  \ across my forehead in the bar behind the Eglise Notre-Dame du Port. He made a\
  \ game out of teaching me survival French. I uttered each phrase, drawing out the\
  \ endings with a Bahamian lilt that was for him what the British accent is to Americans.\
  \ My reward for correctness was a kiss to the cheekbone. The kisses began a downward\
  \ trend. His lips met mine. To kiss him was not agony, but neither was it pleasure.\
  \ There was attraction more in the way he reminded me of Paris, and of the life\
  \ I lived whenever I was in Europe. When he kissed me, there was no perfervid desire\
  \ on my part. He was dazzled by my caf\xE9 au lait skin and dainty build. \n\nThe\
  \ more he fawned over me, the more the winds of apathy tempered and subdued. I lived\
  \ for my romantic tastes. When, after lunch and wine, we climbed the steep steps\
  \ to join a few stragglers at the top of the castle, he took me in his arms and\
  \ kissed me dearly. I smiled and gazed at the panorama of the Mediterranean coastline.\
  \ His desire was exquisite, and it worked its way over me like a mist, clouding\
  \ my soul with a volcanic passion. Nature guided us deeper into the winding path\
  \ of the garden. I will not describe the scene of that garden, but I will say that\
  \ the middle-aged French photographer saw a young couple on a bench tangled into\
  \ a confusion of limbs and sighs amid all those blossoms and vines. After some moments,\
  \ Alessandro had been tanned with foundation meant for brown skin. We went running\
  \ down the steps to the boardwalk, among the citrus-colored buildings and expensive\
  \ restaurants of the Promenade des Anglais. We held hands in the backseat of an\
  \ Uber, and I panicked about missing my flight to London. \u201DI will miss my Bahamian\
  \ lioness,\" he whispered to me. And we arrived at the hostel, and we stood at the\
  \ hostel door, and we kissed, and we held hands. And Raul the receptionist saw."
