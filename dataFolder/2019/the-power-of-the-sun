Text: "\u201CHej Ghana\u201D, that\u2019s how Professor Bjorn called me as I parked\
  \ my bright green bicycle, a welcome gift from the university to all exchange students.\
  \ I enjoyed a cup of hot chocolate most mornings with him as he drank coffee and\
  \ took a few puffs from his custom-made wooden pipe. At the end of our conversations,\
  \ he would say: \u201CHej Ghana, just wait until it is summer, hopefully this year,\
  \ we will have a good one.\u201D\n\nWhen you think of summer, one of the things\
  \ that is almost always associated with it, is the sun. In Denmark summer is mostly\
  \ associated with rain and wind. No wonder there was so much excitement when weather\
  \ forecasters predicted that July 2018 would be the sunniest month in decades. \n\
  \nMy extroverted personality enabled me to start conversations with people, at random\
  \ as we waited for a train or bus. I found it sometimes awkward in a country where\
  \ the average person is said to be reserved. Most of the time I was asked two questions\
  \ in succession; what brings you to Denmark and how do you find the Danish weather?\n\
  \n After a few weeks, I concluded that the weather is the most talked about topic\
  \ in Denmark. The weather pattern fluctuated so much that at some point I stopped\
  \ checking my weather app and just permanently took my rain coat with me each time\
  \ I went out. \n\nI was working on a project with other students in Odense, dubbed\
  \ the Cycle City, to develop a technology that would enable children with autism\
  \ enjoy their immediate surroundings. As I looked through the huge glass window,\
  \ I saw students from the building across the street charging out, all at once.\
  \ Instinctively, I  ran out of the room and asked one of the students if something\
  \ was wrong, as I thought there was a fire. To my surprise, the response I got was\
  \ \u201Cthe sun is out\u201D. I then began to experience a lot of fun activities;\
  \ students riding their skateboards, some having snacks on the wooden benches  and\
  \ the rest lying or sitting on the grass to enjoy some sun. I didn\u2019t expect\
  \ to find a group of people that appreciated the sun so much. \nI am from Ghana,\
  \ in West Africa, where I experience the sun at least ten months a year. So, it\
  \ almost seemed like a normal thing, or I had taken the sun for granted.\n\nI became\
  \ very intrigued by the genuine appreciation Danes had for the sun. In the process\
  \ of asking questions and trying to understand why there was always some type of\
  \ outdoor activity or excitement when the sun came out I discovered a very important\
  \ word in Danish culture, Hygge - \u201Ca feeling or a sense of cosiness which involves\
  \ food, drinks and good company\u201D as my former roommate Rasmus  describes it.\
  \ \n\nOver time I experienced many versions of Danish Hygge. However, my most profound\
  \ memory of Hygge was when Rasmus\u2019s family invited me for lunch. It was quite\
  \ a spread of Danish sandwiches; I was served rye bread, egg salad, shrimp, pickled\
  \ beetroot and breaded fish with the famous Danish condiment: remoulade. The highlight\
  \ of the lunch was a \"treat among many treats\" that most Danes serve during the\
  \ summer, Jordb\xE6r med fl\xF8de, which is strawberries and cream. I was told stories\
  \ of the strawberry picking process and how they are organically and locally grown.\
  \ After our bellies were full, we had coffee and tea. I was given a ticket to one\
  \ of Europe\u2019s largest music festivals: Roskilde festival, as an early birthday\
  \ present. \n\nI was blessed with Danish sunshine, the company of thousands people\
  \ and amazing performances from artistes like Metallica, Rihanna and Kendrick Lamar.\
  \ It was a sight to behold- a riot of colours: orange, purple, yellow and blue,\
  \ people involved in  nude races, with breasts bobbing and dangling penises, regular\
  \ public display of affection and constant fountains of beer! It was unlike anything\
  \ I had ever seen! On my flight to Ghana, I pondered over the words of the late\
  \ musical legend Bob Marley: \u201CIn the abundance of water, the fool is thirsty\u201D"
