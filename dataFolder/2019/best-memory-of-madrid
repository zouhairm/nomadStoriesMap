Text: "Meandering through Retiro park and Palacio De Cristal left our throats dry.\
  \ We decided to seek out a pisco sour for our afternoon libation. Pisco is Peru\u2019\
  s \u2018national drink\u2019, one I fell in love with on an earlier adventure.\n\
  Leaving Plaza Mayor, we wandered down a quiet cobbled alley littered with parked\
  \ motor bikes and a few small restaurants and bars. With limited Spanish speaking\
  \ skills,  Aaron was designated to find out which bar offered pisco. Exiting the\
  \ first one, he said they didn\u2019t seem to understand what he was asking.  He\
  \ tried the bar next store but encountered a similar response.   A middle aged man\
  \ came out of the first bar and started talking to Aaron. Then a short, thick woman\
  \ came rushing out of the second bar, hesitated, and burst into the conversation,\
  \ which she quickly dominated. She directed us to a bar three blocks away. \nWe\
  \ arrived per her directions, doors wide open. As we entered the bartender announced\
  \ they were closed and wouldn\u2019t open until 9:00 PM. Our exit was aborted by\
  \ a large older gent\u2014probably my age but who had enjoyed far more tapas than\
  \ I had\u2014who told us in English to wait while he talked to the owner. A few\
  \ minutes later, the owner came out and proclaimed the bar closed. As we hit the\
  \ street, the big ol\u2019 guy moseyed by and muttered, \u201CWell, I tried.\u201D\
  \nWe wandered back the way we had come and decided to have a drink in the bar that\
  \ bore the excited lady.  There was table seating for twelve, eight of which were\
  \ occupied by a group, and bar seating for 3, one of which was occupied by a lanky\
  \ old man who had stared at the bottoms of too many cervezas. Obviously, this was\
  \ not a tourist hot spot, which made it perfect. \nWe ordered Mahou and allowed\
  \ the waitress, our excitable lady, to recommend something to nibble on.  She delivered\
  \ a large platter of fatty meats and aged cheeses, all of which were zesty and delicious.\
  \  When the other table cleared out, we asked our waitress where she was from. \u201C\
  Peru\u201D...which is why she was so excited to here somebody ask for pisco.  She\
  \ said she goes by \u201CKathy\u201D, though the Peruvian Catalina was gentler on\
  \ the ears.  She had been in Spain for 4 years, to which the old man sitting at\
  \ the end of the bar muttered through a grin, \u201CWe let her live here,\u201D\
  \ and shuffled out.\nKathy had served a round of shots to the other group. We asked\
  \ what that was and she quickly recommended it. Orujo is an after dinner drink that\
  \ helps with digestion and comes in three flavors. We ordered orujo kaffee and orujo\
  \ verde, one of each for each of us. Served in a chilled glass, it was about as\
  \ subtle as a head butt from a bull. \nKathy then explained in Spanish (which I\
  \ couldn\u2019t understand) and with wild gesticulations (which told the entire\
  \ story) that when Aaron came in asking about pisco, she was in the bathroom. She\
  \ was so excited to hear \u201Cpisco\u201D, she quickly finished her business and\
  \ while still pulling up her pants, came rushing out. Image this mime accompanied\
  \ by loud, excited Spanish!  We laughed so hard it was difficult to stay on the\
  \ chair, a feat not helped in the least by the orujo. Kathy then spontaneously served\
  \ us orujo blanco, a clear liquid from 'el diablo' himself! It went down smooth\
  \ and strong. Walking was going to be challenged by more than the cobblestones.\
  \ \nMarianne asked Kathy if we could take her picture. She nodded, and as soon as\
  \ the photo was taken she started clearing our table. We pointed out there was another\
  \ camera. Out of nowhere, she palmed a tube of lipstick and painted her lips, pulled\
  \ the comb our of her hair and shook it loose so it fell over on shoulder; now she\
  \ was ready to be photographed as the glamorous women from Peru.\n We laughed until\
  \ we hurt, and then departed with our best memory of Madrid."
