Text: "London gave me more than a wonderful experience, it gave me a hunger for more\
  \ and Kensington is to blame. My wife and I arrived at what according to our driver\
  \ is considered a very posh area, but what I saw was the fruits of a lot of hard\
  \ work and dedication. While yes there was an exaggerated number of high-end cars\
  \ (BMW and Mercedes Benz seem to have a had a \u201Csale\u201D), there was also\
  \ an amazing atmosphere of passion, culture, and diversity. The streets are filled\
  \ with pubs, restaurants, and businesses that range from the typical British inspired\
  \ to the Italian, French, Spanish, Arabic, Asian and even Latino. Through the trains,\
  \ the busses, the uber cars I discovered something that, pardon my ignorance, was\
  \ unknown to me, and that is the reality of London as a hub for the world to converge.\
  \ You saw people from all over the world coming together in this posh area to not\
  \ be eccentric and show off what their wallets could buy, but to test what their\
  \ minds and hearts could accomplish. While buying coffee at a Paul\u2019s nearby\
  \ I saw that all the employees were from different points in the globe (one day\
  \ there was Brazil, France, Italy, India and another day there was Spain, Argentina,\
  \ Nigerian, and Britain) and that amazed me. It was like seeing something that is\
  \ as rare as near extinct species and that was a comradery between people from all\
  \ walks in life that came from very distinct routes to this place in London that\
  \ specialized in delivering French coffee and pastries. \nNot only was this seem\
  \ in every street, in every shop, and in every face that passed us by as we walked\
  \ from place to place, but also the staff at our hotel was a perfect example. They\
  \ were from many different countries in Europe (Ukraine, Spain, France, etc.) and\
  \ the way they worked together was just amazing. There was one concierge who through\
  \ kindness and honesty earned my wife\u2019s and mine\u2019s trust and thanks. He\
  \ was one of the most amazing people you could have ever met and he gave us tips\
  \ to explore the city in a meticulous and easy to understand manner that we even\
  \ ended up believing ourselves to be Londoners. We felt welcomed in every place\
  \ we stopped at and it did not matter where we found ourselves because there was\
  \ always a smile waiting. London is a fantastic beast whose heart beats not through\
  \ its streets, its history, its royalty but to each and every single person that\
  \ lives in it. It does not matter where you come from if you are hungry enough the\
  \ city can offer you an opportunity to show it and the world how great you are.\n\
  After this trip I was left with a question that still roams through my head, \u201C\
  Should we start looking at opportunities for work in London?\u201D. While the answer\
  \ is still unknown, one thing is for sure, we will be back to discover more of the\
  \ magic, the beauty, the history and the people of this everlasting city."
