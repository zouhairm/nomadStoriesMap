Text: "Buenos Aires certainly has many GOOD'S: Good wines, good roasts, good beer,\
  \ good pizzas, good \"empanadas\", good ice cream, good museums, good places, but\
  \ above all good and very warm people.\n\nThis city of South America also has many\
  \ MANY'S: Many monuments, lots of green, many neighborhoods, lots of nightlife and\
  \ many ways to spend it spectacularly well. Whether it's a homemade barbecue, having\
  \ \"empanadas\" at the foot of a large monument in a \"plaza\", visiting a museum,\
  \ cultural center or theater, enjoying a weekend in \"El Tigre\" or walking through\
  \ one of its neighborhoods, you'll always end up with the heart and the stomach\
  \ full of satisfaction.\n\nThe capital of Argentina offers everything for everyone,\
  \ every day of the week. It is a city full of life, passion, and colors where you\
  \ will always have a good excuse to put on your sneakers and go out to enjoy its\
  \ charm.\n\nThe so-called capital of the tango offers at every step endless monuments\
  \ and outdoor sculptures, buildings, palaces and mansions inspired by French architecture\
  \ that will leave you amazed. From the most historic to the most innovative sculptures\
  \ such as the Floralis Generica, you will have to turn your eyes to each step you\
  \ take.\n\_\nPalermo is one of the largest neighborhoods, and for my taste, the\
  \ greenest part of Buenos Aires. You are amazed by all the different shades of green\
  \ you see thanks to the multiple squares or parks that connect one behind the other.\
  \ As if that were not enough, if you have the opportunity to explore the area by\
  \ foot, you will surely have the same luck as me and you will run into Palermo Soho,\
  \ a division of Palermo that offers a more bohemian and artistic spirit. In this\
  \ area, you will find countless graffiti and murals and you will feel that the walls\
  \ speak to you with different messages of love, stencils against globalization,\
  \ portraits of unforgettable idols, among others. \n\nAnother neighborhood that\
  \ surprised me pleasantly is Recoleta, mainly because of its French-style architectural\
  \ beauty. While touring its streets you can find excellent restaurants, luxurious\
  \ and original clothing and footwear stores, as well as many of its most important\
  \ historical monuments.\n\nGoing down the street 9 de Julio, you will run into the\
  \ oldest neighborhood in the city: San Telmo. With its cobbled streets, this is\
  \ where the roots of Buenos Aires are shown through its antiques fair in Plaza Dorrego.\
  \ Among thousands of rare objects, curiosities and clothes from another era, you\
  \ can explore this wonderful neighborhood full of history, tango houses, talented\
  \ artisans, parks, restaurants, and street fairs.\n\nIn the open air is my favorite\
  \ neighborhood, the neighborhood of La Boca. A neighborhood of immigrants from southern\
  \ Italy settled on the banks of the Riachuelo rich in culture and traditions, but\
  \ above all light and color. With its thousands of \"conventillos\", this neighborhood\
  \ offers unforgettable experiences in every corner you have to discover. \n\nWithout\
  \ a doubt, it is through your neighborhoods that you know Buenos Aires, however,\
  \ it is also through its food that you never forget it. The meat is the gastronomic\
  \ symbol of the \"porte\xF1os\". There are options for all tastes, from the high-end\
  \ grills where you can eat the best meat in the world, to the street stalls that\
  \ serve an unforgettable \"chorip\xE1n\". Among other great culinary delights are\
  \ pizza, artisan ice cream, empanadas, dulce de leche, alfajores and mate. \n\n\
  Another unmissable delight are the \"cafetines\" of Buenos Aires, among them the\
  \ most famous and old Caf\xE9 Tortoni, where a break is required to have a coffee\
  \ or \"churros\" with chocolate. With more than 150 years of life, this is the place\
  \ where you can sit in the same place as Jorge Luis Borges and Federico Garc\xED\
  a Lorca.\n\_\nThis is the end point of my experience in Buenos Aires, which leaves\
  \ my heart beating at full speed just to remember what I lived, and the great desire\
  \ to return to this beautiful city full of good air, air of light, color, culture,\
  \ cuisine and a lot of history."
