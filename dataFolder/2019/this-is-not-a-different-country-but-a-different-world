Text: "There I was after a 10 hour flight, I had just landed in Japan. Ahead of me\
  \ 15 days full of adventures, behind me lots of doubts about this destination. \n\
  After finding my way to the hostel I learn my first lesson: distance in Japan is\
  \ slightly different than in Europe. What I thought was central, was not really.\
  \ \n\nNever mind, let's check the room, a tiny bedroom where I could stand with\
  \ extended arms and touch both walls, where I had to decide if I wanted to stay\
  \ on the bed -a hard matress on the floor- or open my hand luggage as both were\
  \ impossible at the same time, where leaving the shoes outside was not only recommended,\
  \ but the only option. Fair enough, rooms here are small. \n\nLet's see if I can\
  \ watch some tv to relax, I turn to find out there was a tiny fridge and a tv on\
  \ top of it, both were holded by a thick chain. And I though this was a safe country.\
  \ I later found out that was not antitheft but a way to avoid things being smashed\
  \ during an earthquake. Not only culture plays a role here, but nature has its say\
  \ too. \n\nAfter I had sorted the accommodation bit, I was going to have my first\
  \ Japanese meal! Given I could not read the meals but see the food on the plate\
  \ represented by its plastic version, I chose the brightest, best looking plastic\
  \ I saw. Fatal error. \n\nI point out what I think could suit my needs and taste.\
  \ Another fatal error. Something different from what I order comes out, served by\
  \ a diligent waitress, who efficiently leaves the plate on the table, mumbles something\
  \ - enjoy your meal, I hope-, bows and leaves. I try to explain that I have a food\
  \ allergy and what I order looked different on the picture and definitively did\
  \ not include this one ingredient I am allergic to, that is now everywhere. To no\
  \ avail, communication is simply impossible. I end up drinking a -now- cold soup,\
  \ eating some kind of algae with chopsticks I cannot control and leaving the whole\
  \ main on the plate. \n\nLet's recap: I have booked a hostel miles away from the\
  \ city, I'm going to sleep on the floor in the smallest bedroom I have ever seen,\
  \ that has a hanging fridge and tv. I have paid an expensive meal chosen based on\
  \ its plastic version, that turns out to be a different thing I am allergic to and\
  \ I have to leave on the table, although I am starving. \n\nI may be too tired,\
  \ I'm going to sleep, things may look brighter tomorrow. \n\nOn the next day things\
  \ were no brighter, I had to find my way to the city, struggle with the extremely\
  \ complicated operating system to be able to catch a train in the right direction\
  \ and with the right company without buying too many wrong tickets.\n\nI also found\
  \ out that yesterday meal experience was not an exception, but a rule and the other\
  \ available option was to grab something of the hot counter in a convenience store,\
  \ which was considerably cheaper and unhealthier. \n\nAfter 2 weeks I had slept\
  \ in different cities and hotels, none of them had a bed , but a variety of matresses\
  \ laid on tatami floor and a capsule hotel. On my last night there, I decided to\
  \ treat myself: I booked a hotel with a single white bed. If heaven exists, it must\
  \ be similar to this. I would have never thought a bed would be something I could\
  \ miss so much, I never though a developed country would not have hotels with regular\
  \ beds. I then learnt what is normal for us, it may not be for everyone else."
