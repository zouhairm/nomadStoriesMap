Text: "Fourteen hours after the plane took off, the longest flight of my life finally\
  \ came to an end when I landed in Qatar. I had no clue what to expect and didn\u2019\
  t know what I would find. I\u2019d never been to the Middle East before, but I had\
  \ heard the stories. I\u2019d seen the accusations of Qatar bankrolling terrorists\
  \ in the newspapers. I\u2019d watched the news and heard others say Americans should\
  \ be wary in the Gulf region. I was honestly a little nervous. I didn\u2019t know\
  \ what I\u2019d find, but that\u2019s the best part of exploring a new place. \n\
  \n     I landed in Doha and took a bus from the airport to the Souq Waqif, which\
  \ is a traditional market. As I stepped off the bus, a new and unfamiliar scent\
  \ hit my nostrils. The air smelled of baharat, turmeric and other exotic aromas\
  \ that I hadn\u2019t experienced before. I didn\u2019t know what it was, but I knew\
  \ it smelled delicious. I looked around and it was painfully obvious I wasn\u2019\
  t from there. I was wearing jeans, not a thobe. Sneakers, not sandals. A baseball\
  \ cap, not a ghutra. Everyone around me was speaking in Arabic. Not a word of English\
  \ to be heard. \n\n     I continued to walk through the market, pausing to take\
  \ photos here and there. On one such occasion, I asked someone to take a photo of\
  \ me in front of a building that was a beautiful example of traditional Qatari architecture.\
  \ Just as the flash on my phone\u2019s camera went off, an older gentleman dressed\
  \ head to toe in Middle Eastern attire quickly emerged from inside. I froze, startled\
  \ and afraid that I had upset him by taking a photo of his home. He was tall and\
  \ intimidating, I thought to myself as we made eye contact. To my surprise, he reached\
  \ out his hand and introduced himself in perfect English. He then invited me inside\
  \ for tea. I politely accepted. \n\n     As we sipped tea, I learned that he was\
  \ part of the Qatari government, much like a member of Congress. The building I\
  \ had been admiring was not his home, but rather a government office used for post-work\
  \ recreation. Men were sitting at tables playing dhama, which is very similar to\
  \ checkers. No women were present. He pointed to an open table and asked if I would\
  \ care to play with him. I took another sip of the hot tea and said yes. \n\n  \
  \   We talked and learned of each other\u2019s cultures. He\u2019d never been to\
  \ America, yet was fascinated by it. He was pleased that I found his stories as\
  \ remarkable as he found mine. Playing dhama with this man reminded me of playing\
  \ checkers with my grandfather as a child. It\u2019s one of my cherished memories.\
  \ He has long passed away so I can\u2019t play with him. Yet watching this man move\
  \ the pieces around the board as he told stories brought back such vivid memories\
  \ of my grandfather that I wanted to bring this game home. \n\n     I asked if there\
  \ was any place in the market where I could purchase one. He nodded and personally\
  \ walked me down the narrow alley to a shop, but it was closed. He told me not to\
  \ worry because he would ask his office to sell me one. We returned and I learned\
  \ the dhama set cost much more there, because it was a nicer version made with real\
  \ wooden pieces. I was told it would be 120 Qatari riyals, which was about $35.\
  \ I respectfully declined and explained how I was on a limited budget. I thanked\
  \ him again for his hospitality. He turned and said something in rapid fire Arabic\
  \ to his assistant. Moments later, the assistant emerged with a brand new game in\
  \ the box. My new friend told me to please have this as a gift to remember my first\
  \ visit to Qatar. While I knew I\u2019d find a souvenir, I did not expect to find\
  \ a friend or such a special gift. As I went to leave and we shook hands, he said,\
  \ \u201CI hope you enjoy my country and I hope that one day you will return.\u201D\
  \ I definitely will."
