Text: Well !! Travelling is my passion earlier i started as a break from your routine
  work .. but slowly it become my addiction cant live without Travel .. my one beautiful
  travel journey was when i visited Tso Mo riri Lake inLadakh apprx 15000 ft above
  from the sea level .. lonely planet .. with breathtaking view of multi shades of
  blue color .. place is preserve for birds breeding .. amazing exprience feel like
  heaven on earth .. so peaceful and solitude in it own way .. usualy this place remains
  untouched bcz of less infrastructure for human being so nature plays it own beauty
  .. overall my exposure was unforgetable and i counted as in my best travel memory
  . Being a traveller this place required some discipline towards nature .. we canot
  make much noise there .. and best time to go there from april to sept mid. I want
  to tell the world or traveller be there once whenver visit to leh- ladakh ... beacuse
  whole route covered with beautiful medows .. mountains . I hope who so ever reading
  this story must understand my feelings towards this Lake . I brewed beautiful memory
  with Tso mo riri Lake , Ladakh India .
