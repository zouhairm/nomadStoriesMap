Text: "Knossos Can Wait\n\nHere\u2019s what happened after I went all the way to Crete\
  \ to see the ancient Minoan palace of Knossos and it was closed because of a strike,\
  \ and then I went to the archaeological museum with the marvelous frescoes and those\
  \ astonishing bare-breasted snake goddesses and it was closed for renovation. Woe\
  \ was unto me, indeed.\nI climbed into a taxi and the driver smiled into the rear-view\
  \ mirror and politely asked, \u201CHow are you on this fine morning?\u201D \n\u201C\
  Kalim\xE9ra. Etsi-ketsi,\u201D I muttered gloomily in my meager Greek: \u201CGood\
  \ morning. So-so.\u201D \nHe raised a querulous eyebrow, so I whined about being\
  \ denied my once-in-a-lifetime visit. I\u2019d planned meticulously, shoehorning\
  \ four Greek islands into a twelve-day family vacation \u2013 no aimless wandering\
  \ on this trip! I\u2019d even learned bits of the language for a deeper connection.\
  \ But fate had derailed my dream.\nI gave the driver our hotel address and explained\
  \ that the family would pack, then leave town after waiting three dull hours for\
  \ the bus to Matala.\nHe tsk-tsked his tongue and shook a finger. \u201CNo. You\
  \ must enjoy Crete with Stelios. I will drive you to Matala for \u20AC100, a tour\
  \ across the island. And I will show you our city, Heraklio, the capital of all\
  \ Crete.\u201D\nI agreed on the spot \u2013 bus fare alone would cost us \u20AC\
  50, and we could avoid wasting time around the hotel. Besides, who knows a city\
  \ better than a taxi driver? \nI told Stelios that the girls were just getting up\
  \ and would be hungry \u2013 would he please choose a place for breakfast and join\
  \ us? He gave me an odd look, grabbed his phone, and spoke in rapid Greek. We learned\
  \ later that he had called to wake his wife Katerina and tell her to expect three\
  \ Americans for breakfast.\nStelios waved brawny arms as he illuminated his city\
  \ for us. The massive fortress walls were 600 years old, built during Venetian rule.\
  \ That tower dated from the 400-year Ottoman reign; this one was damaged when Crete\
  \ rebelled. \nWe stopped at a church, a beautiful Byzantine church, almost a cathedral.\
  \ It was 9:30 on Sunday morning and worshipers spilled out through the doors and\
  \ onto the sidewalk; others watched through open windows. Stelios herded us forward\
  \ and the throng parted willingly to allow us, obvious foreigners, to share their\
  \ ceremony. The service was short on preaching, long on ritual and chanting and\
  \ color and incense. Everyone took part; everyone smiled.\nStelios took us to his\
  \ apartment \u2013 \u201Cnot rich, not poor\u201D \u2013 and we stumbled upon something\
  \ profound. We all talked and Stelios translated. Katerina, whose hair alone might\
  \ have launched a thousand ships, served us Greek coffee with homemade Cretan delicacies:\
  \ bougatsa, sfakianopita, kalitsounia. She had relinquished her career as a chef\
  \ to linger with their almost-grown sons before they left home. She showed us their\
  \ pictures, told us of the one who became cross-eyed overnight and of his miraculous\
  \ healing; we told about our own son\u2019s eye cancer.\nKaterina was an artisan\
  \ who created dazzling lacy tattings, treasures worth hundreds of dollars . . .\
  \ and she gave one to my wife. Then she gave one to our daughter \u201Cfor your\
  \ hope chest.\u201D I shared my pictures of grandma and grandpa and the kids and\
  \ the dog and the Colorado mountains and the deep snow last Christmas. Stelios told\
  \ of losing his jewelry business because \u201CI trusted others too much.\u201D\
  \ Life had pushed his dream aside, too, a bigger one.\nWe were embarrassed at their\
  \ hospitality and generosity; people just don\u2019t do this stuff. But Stelios\
  \ said, \u201CNo passengers ever asked me to eat with them. How can I take them\
  \ anywhere but my own house?\u201D \nWe drove slowly through the hills and fields\
  \ to Matala. Stelios, the gentle ex-paratrooper, led us on a reminiscence of his\
  \ boyhood in the country. He explained the olive orchards, his hometown festivals,\
  \ the Minoan site of Phaestos. He found us a hotel and said goodbye. If I had offered\
  \ him more money, he would have refused. \nThe Minoans are dust in the wind, but\
  \ their descendants have taught me a Greek word that lives on. Philoxenia: kindness\
  \ to strangers."
