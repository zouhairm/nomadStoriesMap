Text: "From great fear comes enlightenment.\n\nOh no, I\u2019m sinking, am I drowning?\
  \ What is this feeling? Wait, I\u2019m still breathing. How is this possible? Then,\
  \ pop I clear my ears slowly sinking ever deeper. Again pop. with every few meters,\
  \ pop, clear, sink some more, pop, clear, sink some more until finally we reach\
  \ the depths of fascination. \n\nFor years I had been told I had to try diving however,\
  \ for a man with an overwhelming fear of drowning, it is an extremely difficult\
  \ task to wrap your head around but one which I will never forget. The following\
  \ is an account of that day, this is my leap or should I say plunge? Into the unknown.\
  \ \n\nThere is perhaps no greater unknown than the oceans abyss. Many claim that\
  \ they know more about life on other planets than they do about creatures in our\
  \ own seas. I for one can fully believe this statement. The shear array of life\
  \ that was on display even at just 10 meters down was incredible. This along with\
  \ the unrelenting feeling of weightlessness, I can only imagine to be the closest\
  \ feeling to flying, makes diving the most majestic and magical experience I have\
  \ had to date. Kind of like gliding through another world or an alternate dimension.\
  \ You are there but you are just a spectator, watching, observing but never disturbing.\
  \ Just floating, an entity nothing more. \n\nAbove you the sounds of boats become\
  \ more deafening,  more difficult to locate, the noise of the fish more real than\
  \ you could ever imagine. You can almost hear them calling out for Nemo I swear\
  \ and yet, somehow with all this racket you still feel completely at peace. Who\
  \ needs meditation retreats? Seriously, if you want to reach enlightenment this\
  \ is the only way.\n\nThe place in which I dived was Sail Rock off the coast of\
  \ Koh Phangan in Thailand. It got its name due to it bearing a striking resemblance\
  \ to a ships sail. Strange how that works so simply really, \n\u201COi, John what\
  \ shall we call that big sail shaped rock over there?\u201D \n\u201CWhy not sail\
  \ rock?\u201D\n\u201Ccor\u2019 blimey guvna, you\u2019re a bleeding genius.\u201D\
  \n\u2018Cause everyone knows sailors are cockney right?\n\nI had elected to do the\
  \ open water rather than my introduction to diving as it seemed a better deal. For\
  \ roughly the equivalent of 30 pounds extra I did four dives instead of just the\
  \ one plus, at the end was allowed to dive upto 10 meters without someone holding\
  \ onto my back.  \n\nOur teacher for the week long course was a fair haired Italian\
  \ lady with eyes so loving they could soothe your soul at the merest glance. She\
  \ had lived in Thailand for a year and had a passion for diving more infectious\
  \ than syphilis. \n\nOur lessons were made up of paper work, learning about the\
  \ safety procedures of diving and practice time in the pool. During this we learned\
  \ how to take weights of, adjust equipment and clear our masks whilst submerged,\
  \ also it gets you used to the very abnormal feeling of breathing underwater. \n\
  \nWe then set out for our first dives. These were the weirdest. I had just got over\
  \ an ear infection which meant a doctor had to clear me to dive but I still had\
  \ a couple of issues as I was descending. \n\nOnce down there though the magical\
  \ feeling became overwhelming. I am flying wow, then suddenly I start to rise uncontrollably.\
  \ I try everything to stop the dangerous ascent. Releasing air from my bouncy aid,\
  \ face upright to decrease surface area but nothing works, I keep climbing then,\
  \ suddenly a hand grasps me and pulls me to safety. It was my instructor, who was\
  \ now my guardian angel. \n\nI found out later that I had swam through a cloud of\
  \ bubbles produced by a lower diver. A common issue in these parts. \n\nMy second\
  \ dive was more successful, I had learnt from my previous mistake and had better\
  \ control over my buoyancy. This particular dive was highlighted instead by the\
  \ rare sighting of a whale shark. Who could have known that something so gargantuan\
  \ could be so graceful, so majestic?"
