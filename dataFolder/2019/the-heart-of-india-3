Text: "On a warm summer morning in forested Central India, my friend and I set off\
  \ from our village in the plains to the only hill-station closeby in hopes of cooler\
  \ climes and picturesque views. As we navigated our ascent through the tall shade\
  \ along the way, we could feel the cool wind approaching. I had been living at a\
  \ village with farmers and forest-dependent communities that cultivated two seasons\
  \ of rice, pulses and sugarcane, alongwith seasonal fruit, flowers and leaves from\
  \ a neighbouring forest. Through the year that I had been at this village to setup\
  \ social enterprises with the communities, I had heard about this hill station,\
  \ but hardly found time to go explore on my own. Today when the day finally arrived,\
  \ I was excited about the drive and the respite from the heat and a break.\nAs we\
  \ reached the onset of the village settlement at this hill, we spotted a couple\
  \ of cafes and a property lined with tents. A quick scan of the menu showed pretty\
  \ western items on the menu like sandwiches, Cutlets, pasta, iced tea, along with\
  \ north Indian staples like Paranthas, Puri aalu and pakoras. Considering that the\
  \ local village settlement housed Tibetan refugees, it came a s a bit of a surprise\
  \ to see this menu. Over a quick lemonade and sandwich we learned from the people\
  \ running the caf\xE9 that this area was increasing being visited by tourists who\
  \ didn\u2019t really want to eat the \u201Cold-fashioned\u201D and \u201Coutdated\u201D\
  \ items of \u201Cvillage-people\u201D. Curiosity led me to start walking around\
  \ the village and I found a shop selling traditional Tibetan food items. Wanting\
  \ to know more about this new snack, I began asking how it was prepared. Sensing\
  \ my enthusiasm, the lady asked me if I would like to sample more of the Tibetan\
  \ food that the community ate everyday. Being the foodie that I am, always in search\
  \ of newer flavours, I was excited and said yes. Through the shop in front of her\
  \ house, she led me to an open verandah where there were other women from the neighbouring\
  \ houses sitting preparing that days lunch. As I sat cleaning the leaves and chatting\
  \ with them about how they came about living in a place so different in climate\
  \ and culture from their original inhabitation, out poured stories of how they had\
  \ to flee the insurgency, leave their homes behind, set up a new refuge for their\
  \ families, their children and rebuild schools and monasteries to keep the community\
  \ going. I was amazed, inspired and a bit wet-eyed all at the same time listening\
  \ to so many stories of everyday courage, told with such openness humour and humility,\
  \ without even a tinge of self-pity. The sadness would reflect in their eyes - a\
  \ touch of wistfulness and nostalgia \u2013 as they spoke of their homes back at\
  \ Tibet. As did the drive in their voices, telling these life histories with such\
  \ grace. While there were men around, a lot of them had picked up jobs far off as\
  \ migrant labourers that would keep them away for months altogether. And it was\
  \ up to the women to run shops, cafes, knit, and stitch clothes for everyday expenses\
  \ to keep their children in schools and fed. The occasional tourist who would venture\
  \ beyond the fancy caf\xE9 at the village outskirt was their means of meagre income.\
  \ As I got up after 3 hours, I asked how much I should pay, the women hugged me\
  \ saying that I was a guest and they couldn\u2019t accept money from me. The warmth\
  \ and self-reliance moved me!\nFor the love of the unexplored, away from crowds\
  \ and an almost mechanical \u2018busy\u2019ness of the clockwork that is city life,\
  \ and having been told countless number of times that the place for a city-bred\
  \ \u201Ceducated\u201D girl like me was to find a \u201Crespectable\u201D job at\
  \ a corporate office, the bold and relentless women of Mainpat showed me a very\
  \ visible example of what dignity and courage looked like was in the deeply patriarchal\
  \ heartland of India. That day\u2019s conversations, both outside and within, reinforced\
  \ the conviction in me that had led me to choose working in remote rural lands of\
  \ India."
