Text: "The train slowly pulled to a halt in the middle of nowhere ie. the Naples countryside.\
  \ There was no panic, yet. Waiting patiently for the train to restart. Five minutes.\
  \ Fifteen minutes. Forty minutes. Whispers, phone calls and general restlessness.\
  \ I was second-guessing my train-booking skills. If only I\u2019d taken the train\
  \ half an hour earlier or later.  My internal voices were only drowned out by Italians\
  \ overanalyzing the situation. Then, dead silence as the voice came over the loudspeaker\
  \ advising the train was \u201Cbroken\u201D and that authorities were investigating\
  \ how to send a rescue vehicle. Even after twelve years in Italy, this was reaching\
  \ a new level of drama. Luckily I understood the announcement in Italian, because\
  \ the passengers spoke over the English one. Panic ensued. Mothers with babies were\
  \ demanding attention, and food! People were praying. Sons were phoning their mothers.\
  \ If I heard it once, I heard it twenty times, \u201CMamma, don\u2019t worry. We\u2019\
  ll be there soon.\u201D\n\nAfter two false starts, it seemed that the train really\
  \ was broken. And then the eerie silence. I was worried about our friend Brigitte\
  \ who had just arrived from London. I\u2019d organized a driver to pick her up from\
  \ the airport and then swing by the station to collect us on the way to Positano.\
  \ I wasn\u2019t sure how much English the driver spoke and Brigitte spoke no Italian.\
  \ To make matters worse my bloody iPhone battery was dying and it was nearly lunchtime.\
  \ Did I mention that the air-conditioning wasn\u2019t working? No power and all.\
  \ I messaged Brigitte that I could see the highway from the train so her driver\
  \ kindly offered to come and get us. The thought of being saved from this drama\
  \ was very appealing until Livia rightly pointed out that we were suspended twenty\
  \ meters above the field and jumping down with our luggage wasn\u2019t really an\
  \ option.\n\nAn announcement. \u201CA rescue vehicle has been sent\u201D. They still\
  \ weren\u2019t sure whether we would be towed from Naples or pushed from Rome but\
  \ after two hours and counting there was plenty of cheering at the news. Of course\
  \ there was still drama. People were arguing with the poor, bewildered Italo staff\
  \ trudging up and down every five minutes kindly offering us water. The restrooms\
  \ were getting uglier by the minute. And then there was the stylish Northern-Italian\
  \ woman who just couldn\u2019t take it anymore. I\u2019m not sure where the staff\
  \ took her because we were already in first class!\nFinally the \u2018rescue vehicle\u2019\
  \ pulled up on the line next to us and we were all told to calmly collect our belongings\
  \ and make our way across the track onto the other train. Remember the steep drop\u2026\
  ? The drivers aligned the trains and Italo staff went about what seemed like their\
  \ maiden attempt to rig a bridge between them. A passenger pointed out that the\
  \ side railings were inserted upside down. It didn\u2019t inspire confidence! We\
  \ were instructed to cross the rickety metal bridge one person at a time. The brave\
  \ man who volunteered to traverse the seven-meter span first even cracked a joke.\
  \ I wasn\u2019t far behind him, glad for once to only have carry-on as I flew across,\
  \ almost throwing myself into the other train. Ahhh blissful air-conditioning! And\
  \ power for my rotten dying phone. Thirty minutes later and we were all across.\n\
  \nThe rescue train took off slowly, travelling the wrong way down the track for\
  \ a about a mile until we were back on course. At this point we stopped again. Italians.\
  \ Moaning. Swearing. Behaving badly. We were moving again, thank God! An announcement\
  \ that we were close to reaching normal speed and would be in Naples in twenty minutes.\
  \ Joyful uproar!\n\nWhen we finally alighted in Naples three hours late, I noted\
  \ from the long list of delayed and cancelled trains that we\u2019d been lucky to\
  \ arrive at all. Amongst the sea of people sprawled throughout the station, I could\
  \ pick out two women waving madly at us \u2013 smiling and carrying two of the best\
  \ pizzas on earth \u2013 margheritas of course. Our driver was a woman (!) and Brigitte\
  \ knows her priorities in Naples. Good things do come to those who wait."
