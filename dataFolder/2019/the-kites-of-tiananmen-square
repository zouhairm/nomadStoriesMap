Text: "It was almost dark in Tiananmen Square and we were running - twisting, turning\
  \ back - feet beating an erratic path between the obelisk and Mao's tomb. The Square\
  \ plays host to tourists by day but now, at night, Beijing was all around us: young\
  \ ones, clutching glow sticks, shaky on rollerblades; old ones who'd unbuttoned\
  \ their cotton pajamas, shirt sides flapping in the breeze. \n\nWe were the only\
  \ people in sight for whom the breeze remained elusive. We were towing a kite that\
  \ would not fly. \n\nWe'd bought it, ten kuai, from a violent old lady at the edge\
  \ of the Square who was selling them out of a plastic bag, together with slick-backed\
  \ copies of the Little Red Book and lighters that trilled \u201CThe East is Red.\u201D\
  \ It didn't work. It had butterflies painted on it, insidious little grinning butterflies,\
  \ and they grinned and they grinned but they just wouldn't leave the ground. \n\n\
  Another vendor had just appeared to inform us that the kite wouldn\u2019t fly because\
  \ it was \u201CJia de,\u201D fake. His kites were blue where ours was pink, pink\
  \ where ours was blue. The butterflies were the same.\n              \nWe looked\
  \ at his kite and we looked at our kite and we looked at each other, angry. \n\n\
  We\u2019d purchased a fake kite.\n              \n(Never had it occurred to me that\
  \ some kites Aren't Real.)\n\n\u201CI will sell you a real kite!\u201D this new\
  \ vendor was insisting, in thick, provincial Mandarin. \u201CReal! Cheap!\u201D\
  \ \n\nOur tolerance for kite vendors at this point was low. \u201CDon't want, thanks,\u201D\
  \ we said to him sharply, in accents that will always belong to foreigners. \n\n\
  \u201CCheap! Real!\u201D\n\n\u201CNo, really,\u201D I said (because I always feel\
  \ like I have to give a reason), \u201Cwe're students, so \u2026 we don't really\
  \ have any money?\u201D This was a lie. Of course we had money. But I wasn\u2019\
  t about to risk spending it on another Fake Kite. \n\n\u201CAh, students!!\u201D\
  \ His smile was immense. \u201CFor students, special price! Two for ten!\u201D\n\
  \nThis guy was really starting to piss us off. Paranoia stalks you when you can't\
  \ tell real from fake, and your sense of proportion suffers. Ten kuai is only slightly\
  \ more than a single U.S. dollar, but the idea that we'd spent any money at all\
  \ on a con was starting to seem like a burning indignity, and one for which all\
  \ poor and desperate vendors were equally to blame. So we said, \u201CDon\u2019\
  t want, thanks,\u201D quite maliciously, and turned to go. \n\n\u201CAt least teach\
  \ me English!\u201D he shouted at our retreating backs. \n\nWe turned. I was struck\
  \ by the enormity of the request. \n\n\u201COk,\u201D I said. \u201CWhat do you\
  \ want to know?\u201D\n\nHe screwed up his face. \u201CNi,\u201D he said, \u201C\
  hen piao liang!\u201D\n              \nI laughed. This was the first thing he wanted\
  \ to know! \u201CYou \u2013 are \u2013 very \u2013 pretty,\u201D I said, slowly.\n\
  \              \nHe tried. \u201CYou \u2013 ah \u2013 prutty,\u201D he said.\n \
  \             \n\u201CNot bad! Bu cuo!\u201D\n              \nHe decided to try\
  \ another one. \u201CZhe shi hen pianyi!\u201D\n            \n\u201CThis \u2013\
  \ is \u2013 very \u2013 cheap.\u201D\n              \n\u201CCheap,\u201D he said.\
  \ \u201CCheap! Cheap!\u201D\n              \n\u201CRight!\u201D I said, and we all\
  \ laughed a little bit, there before the door of Mao\u2019s tomb. He showed us,\
  \ on his flip phone, a picture of his ten-month-old: a tiny boy with a pink flannel\
  \ jumpsuit and a grainy, indistinct face. And then he said Thanks, and we said Mei\
  \ guanxi, and that was it.\n              \nAnd as we walked away I heard him shouting\
  \ \u201CYou ah very prutty! Cheap-a cheap-a!\u201D at a clump of middle-aged Western\
  \ tourists. Unable to tell real from fake, they clutched their backpack straps and\
  \ let their eyes slide over him."
