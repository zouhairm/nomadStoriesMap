Text: "We hadn\u2019t come to Playa Bacocho for the sea turtle release, but we lined\
  \ up alongside the other gringos and g\xFCero and chinos anyway. It felt good to\
  \ breathe the ocean air again after an afternoon stuffed into an under-ventilated\
  \ bus.\n\nThe bus had carried us up the Pacific coast of Oaxaca, trundling from\
  \ Mazunte, the post-hippie playground of beachfront pizza shacks and mezcalerias,\
  \ past Zipolite with its full-moon nudist bacchanals, toward Puerto Escondido. Along\
  \ the way, I listened to climate activist Greta Thunberg\u2019s TED talk on the\
  \ necessity of sweeping global action to combat climate change.\n\nThough her message--recorded\
  \ in Sweden, downloaded in the USA, and humped to Mexico--applied to country, culture,\
  \ and the individual, it was too easy to relapse into irresponsible tourism upon\
  \ stepping off the bus hungry in Puerto Escondido. My traveling partner Josh and\
  \ I commenced to devour street tacos: carnitas served on single-use styrofoam trays.\
  \ We drank agua fresca out of single-use plastic cups. We ordered coffee and snapped-on\
  \ plastic to-go lids. Feeling that twinge of guilt, I waved off the sleeve that\
  \ the barista was about to slip on the cup. She shrugged, and threw the unused sleeve\
  \ in the trash.\n\nOnce satiated, Josh and I sought out a long stretch of beach\
  \ on which to have a tertulia--a rambling, Socratic conversation about life, art,\
  \ travel. We had both been sombered by the insect apocalypse, what we saw as a herald\
  \ of the end of global culture as we knew it. So, discovering Playa Bacocho, we\
  \ wedged our butts into a sand dune to contemplate climate depression.\n\n\u201C\
  What difference does my coffee sleeve make when millions of people eat off single-use\
  \ trays every meal?\u201D I asked. \u201CWhat can one person do against the political\
  \ machine? When 100 companies are responsible for 71% of global emissions?\u201D\
  \n\n\u201CNot fly from Boston to Mexico, for one. Not eat meat every meal.\u201D\
  \ Josh grimaced. \u201CBut meat is so good.\u201D\n\nWe suspended our discussion\
  \ as a crowd gathered. Tourists cradling baby turtles in coconut shells wandered\
  \ seaward from a vivero, a shack upbeach where the turtles had been hatched the\
  \ night before. The tourists waited at a roped-off slant of beach, ten meters of\
  \ sand raked smooth that stretched between the hatchlings and open ocean. Ten meters\
  \ patrolled by two local volunteers, gripping fistfuls of sand.\n\nOn command, the\
  \ tourists released their turtles, encouraging their sprint to the ocean in a babel\
  \ of tongues. But the turtles waddled lethargically towards the setting sun, parallel\
  \ to the beach.\n\nThen the birds arrived, dive bombing the hatchlings. Screaming,\
  \ the tourists stormed under the rope.\n\n\u201CGet back!\u201D the volunteers cried.\
  \ As they did, gull after gull snatched the hatchlings behind them.\n\nAll but two\
  \ of the tourists obeyed. These two stood over their turtles like implacable scarecrows,\
  \ escorting them to the waves. Meanwhile, the volunteers flung handfuls of sand\
  \ at the gulls, grinning buffoonishly at every gasp and sigh from the crowd. The\
  \ birds, unbothered by the sand, picked off the hatchlings one\n\nby one\n\nby one.\n\
  \nThe gulls, satiated, retreated. A lone, late-released turtle found the waves.\n\
  \nJosh and I turned toward the sunset, hoping that the currents ripping along the\
  \ tideline would keep the hatchling safe and knowing that they wouldn\u2019t. The\
  \ species depends on numbers for survival. Sea turtles hatch together, cross the\
  \ beach together, overwhelm the waves so that a few, one percent, might slip through.\
  \ What chance does one hatchling alone have?\n\nFatalism gripped us as we bandied\
  \ facts, numbers: the sixth mass extinction, 150-200 species every day, 1.5 degrees\
  \ by 2030. What difference can one person make?\n\nAs we walked away, a final gull\
  \ plucked the last hatchling from the waves. The crowd was too heartbroken to even\
  \ groan.\n\nLater, in Mexico City, Josh and I would find street vendors who refused\
  \ patrons straws, cafes that worked only with organic farms, tourism companies in\
  \ which 100% of the money returned to the community.\n\nBut it was then, when that\
  \ final turtle was gone, that Greta Thunberg\u2019s words came back to me. There\
  \ is only one fight. And unless we all struggle together, none of us is going to\
  \ make it."
