Text: "I was standing in a thrilling place when a talkative local man mentioned my\
  \ name and other participants. He was Sam, our tour guide. A slanted-eyed man with\
  \ brown skin and black hair, as the particularity of Indochina race.\n\nEscaping\
  \ from the grief of heartbreak had brought me there to Chu Chi Tunnels. It is a\
  \ historical park located 75 km northwest of Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam, which were\
  \ built to preserve the historical event of Vietnam war in 1960s. It should have\
  \ been an interesting trip. I did not know the rest story more heartbreaking instead.\n\
  \nMy friend and I were with two couples from Australia and Japan. We had our first\
  \ time experiencing historical adventure. We stepped up on rock stairs covered by\
  \ scattered dry leaves as Sam led the way. \u201CIt was in 1940s when the war was\
  \ begun\u201D Sam told. He stopped and pointed out under his feet. There was a hole\
  \ which he described as a doorway for people who lived underneath during the war.\
  \ It was a body-sized hole like manhole designed for standard Asian body size. Sam\
  \ showed us how to go down the vertical hole that lead to a tunnel. \u201Care you\
  \ joking Sam?\u201D surprisingly an Australian girl shouted. \u201CNo mam, I will\
  \ show you some chambers inside\u201D Sam remarked. I was stunned inwardly and excited\
  \ at the same time. My curiousity and adrenaline were increasing by the time they\
  \ went down the hole.\n\nAs Sam Told us, there was a tunnel inside. We had to crawling\
  \ instead of walking because of the height of the tunnel were around 50 to 80 cm.\
  \ Sam still managed to tell the story with his gasping voice while he was crawling.\
  \ His emotional description about how the Vietnamese built this long tunnel with\
  \ bare hand had successfully amazed me on how strong their struggle was. \u201C\
  Only short distance firstly in the late 1940s, then they expanded the tunnels in\
  \ the early 1960s until reach Cambodia\u2019s border as the United States increasingly\
  \ escalated its military presence\u201D. I shouted to Sam \u201CHow many miles is\
  \ it?\u201D. He said the tunnels were about 250 km for total long with alternate\
  \ doorway in every 20 meters and were built in the area of solid-phase soil gravel.\
  \ I had not thought to have more than 20 meters experience since I felt those musty\
  \ smell with lack of oxygen and darkness inside. I felt myself sweaty and dirty\
  \ of the soil while trying to imagine what had happened there during the war. We\
  \ encountered with the chamber as Sam said and stopped for a moment \u201Cthis is\
  \ the chamber that I told you ladies and gentlemen, the Vietcong (as he called the\
  \ Vietnamese) stayed all day underneath to hide and avoid bombing, aerial attacks,\
  \ house troops, and out for supplies at night\u201D He described. \u201CA house\
  \ troops?\u201D my friend asked. \u201CYes mam, the family lived, delivered baby,\
  \ even died here, some out of epidemic disease, some out of venomous animals such\
  \ as snake, scorpion, etc\u201D. I gasped listening to Sam\u2019s explanation. The\
  \ hardship they had been through had massively changed my paradigm. We moved along\
  \ leaving the chamber while Sam kept telling the story until eventually reached\
  \ the first 20 meters alternate doorway and out of the tunnel.\n\nIt was sunny day.\
  \ I stared at the sky and felt the warm air with tropical breeze of Southeast Asia.\
  \ Thinking some families lived under the tunnel with pain and sorrow had deeply\
  \ broken my heart. It had also made me realize that my grief of heartbreak was nothing\
  \ compared to it. \u201CLadies and gentlemen, there are other experiences with other\
  \ stories still waiting for you, let\u2019s move along\u201D. Sam\u2019s voice interrupted\
  \ my imagination."
