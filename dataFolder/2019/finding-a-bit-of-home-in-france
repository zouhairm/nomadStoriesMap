Text: "We were cautioned about Paris before we arrived. The city\u2019s reputation\
  \ of being dirty, smelly, and dangerous had proceeded it and we stepped off the\
  \ plane apprehensively. As children, Dayna and I had spent our weekends planning\
  \ exotic, European vacations while pouring over an atlas. However, by the time we\
  \ turned 18, the city no longer seemed to be considered a historical juggernaut\
  \ or the most romantic city in the world, and instead something significantly less\
  \ impressive. \n\n\tHowever, the airport seemed to be copy-and-pasted from every\
  \ other airport we\u2019d come across on our trip and it was hard to determine anything\
  \ about the city\u2019s character from it. If I\u2019m ever in charge of designing\
  \ an airport, you better believe it\u2019ll be dripping with cultural stereotypes.\
  \ If you don\u2019t feel like you\u2019ve walked into Australia Zoo when arriving\
  \ in Brisbane, what\u2019s the point? \n\nWe paused for coffee, like the caffeine-dependant\
  \ university students we are, at the Starbucks that was conveniently situated by\
  \ the entry to the train station. Something I hadn\u2019t considered when researching\
  \ Europe was how commercialisation would still persist in cities I had spent years\
  \ dreaming about. I was reminded about the fact that they hadn\u2019t been paused\
  \ in time every time I rounded a corner and spotted yet another H&M or McDonalds.\
  \ \n\nOur arrival in Montmartre was met with a wall of noise as we stepped out from\
  \ the underground into the crisp, winter air. Montmartre, a district located in\
  \ Paris\u2019s 18th arrondissement, was historically known as an artist\u2019s paradise.\
  \ However, the 21st century has been harsh on this village on a hill. Sacr\xE9-C\u0153\
  ur still looms over the city, as breathtaking and overwhelming as ever, but much\
  \ of the area appears to be just as commercialised as the rest of Europe. As we\
  \ stepped off the metro, a parade (or potentially a protest) flooded the streets,\
  \ people yelling in a language we didn't understand, waving flags that we didn\u2019\
  t recognise. A flier was shoved into my hands, an unknown man's face looking up\
  \ at me and French text surrounding did little to help me understand. Unable to\
  \ work out what was going on, we escaped the crowds. After justifying to ourselves\
  \ that consuming French fries in France was actually embracing the culture of the\
  \ city we slipped into a familiar building, the golden arches a welcoming gateway.\
  \ \n\nParis had done little to quell the connotations we\u2019d acquired so far\
  \ but our AirBnb began to overcome them. The building\u2019s stone walls were covered\
  \ in cracks and vines that reached up to the terraces and shutters that hovered\
  \ above our heads. It felt like a fairy tale, as if Rapunzel\u2019s long, blonde\
  \ locks would knock us on our heads at any moment and wake us up from the dream\
  \ we\u2019d stumbled into. Unfortunately, it wasn\u2019t a princess that woke us\
  \ up, but rather the realisation that our apartment was on the sixth floor and that\
  \ there was no lift. \n\nOur journey the next day into the city also began to conquer\
  \ some our apprehension of the city as we spent our morning taking photos of every\
  \ single doorframe, lamp post, and motorbike we spotted. Parked next to one particularly\
  \ photogenic pastel blue Vespa was a cafe promising Australian coffee. We hadn\u2019\
  t realised how much we missed home and all that came with it until we stepped through\
  \ the painted, blue door of the caf\xE9 and the bell dinged above our heads.The\
  \ young girl who led us to our table looked and sounded as if she\u2019d just hopped\
  \ off a plane from Bondi, freckles colouring her tan face even in the middle of\
  \ a Parisian winter. Our table was positioned into what seemed to be the Australian\
  \ half of Contiki tour and another girl group. Although these stylish, Parisian\
  \ women were several decades older than us, the laughter they shared over their\
  \ drinks simultaneously was a glimpse into our future as well as a nostalgic reminder\
  \ of the laughter we would share over our primary school, packed lunches many years\
  \ ago. We hadn't expected to find a piece of home, or a glimpse at our future selves\
  \ in Paris but as we sipped flat whites, we sure were glad we did."
