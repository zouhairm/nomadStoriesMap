  \ to seven generations of divine feminine energy . We all want to know where we\
  \ come from and the only way to find out is by connecting to the local and our ancestors\
  \ through spirit. \nSince I was raised in the Catholic religion I am interested\
  \ in learning and experiencing the many different religions forms around the world\
  \ that my ancestors were involved in their lives.\n The end result is to share the\
  \ one common characteristic about religion to the world which consist of the Holy\
  \ Spirit and God.   \nAs I continue my Spiritual journey to connect with my ancestors\
  \ in the places where they worshipped I look for insight to what my purpose in life.\n\
  There have been so many different origins of religion in the world on some of the\
  \ similar content, some of different practicing\u2019s, and then some of different\
  \ ceremonies. It is important even though there are so many different religions\
  \ to still be able to connect with God so we can continue to have hope and faith\
