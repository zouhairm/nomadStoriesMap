Text: "The car puttered through the dark streets of Kathmandu. There was a power-outage,\
  \ but the shopkeepers at work highlighted their wares with bright spotlights, unfazed.\
  \ We met Milan, the man who drove us, hours ago at the orphanage he sponsored in\
  \ our neighborhood. I was in my second month of teaching English at a women\u2019\
  s center. My two housemates in the back seat with me volunteered at other sites\
  \ around town, like Milan\u2019s orphanage. \nHe invited us for a \u201Cmomo party\u201D\
  \ to make heavenly Himalayan dumplings with the kids. That\u2019s where he told\
  \ us about raksi. Raski is the local brew in Nepal, distilled from rice or millet.\
  \ If you tried to find it in a store or on a menu in busy, backpacker\u2019s Thamel,\
  \ you\u2019d be disappointed because it\u2019s typically homemade or tucked away\
  \ in an off-the-map \u201Cspeakeasy\u201D. Raksi is also illegal to make at home.\
  \ The reasons range from that it can\u2019t be regulated for safety, to tax issues,\
  \ or to curb drinking.\nDespite the risks, Milan offered an opportunity to try some,\
  \ so we took it. A few hushed phone calls later, we were zig zagging towards Milan\u2019\
  s friend\u2019s place. The friend wouldn\u2019t be there, but in true Nepali fashion,\
  \ strangers were more than welcome into his home and try his mother\u2019s raksi.\
  \ \nWe turned off the main road and it was Spinal Tap album cover black. We parked,\
  \ and a dark figure glided toward the car, a woman carrying a toddler. His head\
  \ whipped up at the white female faces peering from the backseat. He started wailing.\
  \ Were we the ghosts, or was he? His mother, the sister of our host and daughter\
  \ of our brewmaster, slipped into the front and her son\u2019s head popped over\
  \ her shoulder.\n\u201CWAAAAAAAAAAAHHHH!\u201D I didn\u2019t need to be fluent in\
  \ Nepali to understand his distress. My eardrums became a tympani in my head The\
  \ three of us smiled kindly even though, internally, we reflected his hesitation.\
  \ \u201COk, now we can go,\u201D Milan cheerfully said. The approach to the house\
  \ was like an ascent to Everest itself, with craggy shadows of houses growing in\
  \ size as we pressed on. Our destination was an imposing gate at a dead end, and\
  \ on the other side, the largest house I had seen in Kathmandu. We went through\
  \ the back door like trusted friends. Our brewmaster greeted us in a traditional\
  \ kurta with her hair in a smoothed bun. Her petite frame stepped away from the\
  \ stove to greet us and we replied with exaggerated smiles to transcend the language\
  \ barrier with the most grateful \u201CNamaste\u201D we could muster. \n\tWe made\
  \ ourselves comfortable in the luxurious living room, our unofficial host a large\
  \ stuffed tiger mid-roar on the black marble floor. A Sprite bottle was brought\
  \ out with four petite glasses. The toddler\u2019s mother poured modest amounts\
  \ of the clear liquid into the cups. We toasted to new friends. I took a sip. It\
  \ tasted like dirt, but Michelin star dirt. It had the fermented paddy taste and\
  \ smell of Sake, but it was much earthier, like mushrooms. The burn was slow and\
  \ deep, like a good massage, encouraging moderation and an appropriately Buddhist\
  \ sense of satisfaction of who you are, where you are.\n\tThe raksi loosened us\
  \ up. We did a lot of listening as Milan told us his story. He gave us details about\
  \ the very recent civil war in Nepal, the tragedies that don\u2019t always make\
  \ Western news. The conflict forced Milan away from his beloved country to Canada,\
  \ but when he returned, he opened an orphanage for children who didn\u2019t have\
  \ the same luck as he did. The recent past of our new home was also a slow and deep\
  \ burn as we sipped on it through his words. My thoughts went to my students, some\
  \ whom were Milan\u2019s age or older. Had they gone through similar hardships?\
  \ If so, their attitudes never showed it, a testament to the resilience and kindness\
  \ of Nepali people. A few glasses later were at our limit. Milan rounded us up,\
  \ we said goodbye to the brewmaster and her daughter as we returned comfortably\
  \ to the friendly night."
