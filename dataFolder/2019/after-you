Text: "After the death or her husband, there was an ambivalent feeling of sorrow,\
  \ fear and freedom. Sorrow, because she lost her first love. Fear because she will\
  \ be single handedly raise two girls; and freedom, because after the years of pain\
  \ and sufering nobody knew she experienced from the hand of the man she loved the\
  \ most, she felt a sense of relief that everything is over... she is free.\n\nShe\
  \ found herself travelling by herself to a place she never thought she could step\
  \ her feet again, the place she wanted to face her fear after years of torment,\
  \ to breath because in the next couple of days, she would be facing everything she\
  \ didn\u2019t thought would happen.\n\nShe walked towards the shore, wanting to\
  \ feel the breeze of wind coming from the sea, she saw a familiar face. Shock stricken,\
  \ she is now looking face to face to man who caused a turn around of events in her\
  \ married life.\n\nWhat will happen to her \u201Cvacation\u201D?\n\nWho is the man\
  \ who she met at the beach?\n\nWhat really happened to them 18 years ago?\n\nWhat\
  \ is her secret that no one knew about?\n\nWhat will be her choice in the end?\n\
  \nThese will be the events that will unfold in this story.  \n\nCharacters will\
  \ include Khaye, the widowed school teacher. Eugene, her husband, Sonny, the unknown\
  \ man, and her two children, Eunice, 17 and Euna, 11."
