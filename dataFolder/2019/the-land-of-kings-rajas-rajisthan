Text: "I was in my first year of graduation, studying journalism. \nIt's was my summer\
  \ break, my family and I decided to visit Rajisthan. Rajisthan is located in the\
  \ north Western region of India, famous for Castle and palaces and stories of great\
  \ Rajput warriors and Kings. \nWe decided to spend our entire break in Udaipur city\
  \ of rajisthan, well known for its royal hospitality, palaces, lakes and royal traditional\
  \ Rajisthani food, all over the world. \nNow there are many great stories about\
  \ Udaipur written already, some people find the royal fort and museum astonishing\
  \ , others embrace the traditional  and warm Rajisthani hospitality. \nBut my story\
  \ is a little different. \n\nHave you ever shed a tear , just after roaming around\
  \ a strange new city ? \nI have . \nThings weren't going too well for me , back\
  \ when I went to visit rajisthan with my parents. \nI used to live in Delhi , polluted,\
  \ corrupted and dusted with traffic and rush. Not just the city but my mind itself\
  \ was polluted with negative thoughts and figures.\n\nOne pleasant evening in Udaipur\
  \ , I was roaming around the local city streets, buying jewelery, scents and paintings.\
  \ \nThe weather was so sweet , the refreshing breeze, the sound of temple bells,\
  \  the kind and beautiful Rajisthani women dancing on the streets and applying heena\
  \ on my hands ,  everything seemed pleasant , pure magic or you call pure happiness.\
  \ \n\nThough I was just another tourist, but the people of the city were so kind\
  \ and welcoming , and sometimes you could sense pure intentions. \nAs I swung across\
  \ the city interacting with locals , I finally ended up at a quite lake.\n\nI could\
  \ see the  reflection of the royal fort on the water surface, all lighted up , all\
  \ golden . \nAnd then suddenly there were fireworks in the deep blue sky, celebrations\
  \ of marriage nearby.\n\nIt was like not only the city but my heart itself was celebrating\
  \ , I thanked God for this life , I learned gratitude for the first time. \n\nNo\
  \ there's nothing materialistic , you can ever imagine that can bring such magic\
  \ in life. \n\nBut it's the people and way of living life , that describes a city,best.\
  \  \n\nTraveling heals heart ,  it's good for the soul. \nDon't just travel ,  but\
  \ explore.\nExplore not just places, but hearts . \n\nWe are privileged,\nThank\
  \ you. \n\nManogya singh"
