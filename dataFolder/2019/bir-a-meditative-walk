Text: "The quiet meditative walk through the trek trail from the midst of the peaceful\
  \ village called \u2018Bir \u2018in the Himalayas drew me closer to myself as I\
  \ stopped to smell a red primula flower of the terrain. \u201CNo words \u201Csaid\
  \ our writing guide and I kept listening to the  sound of my uneven breath against\
  \ the quiet gush of the river flowing a few metres away. As  we left the buildings\
  \ with the Buddhist chants behind the wind spoke to me of a time lost in the recesses\
  \ of my mind. As I kept traveling into the unknown I became more aware of myself.\
  \ The weight I was carrying from age and urban rage. I was in a grove so pure that\
  \ I sat like a sage myself on the tip of the hill with all beneath. All near yet\
  \ far . And in the distance some travellers took dives with paragliders becoming\
  \ a spec in the air. Making the sky look more powerful. A leap into that forest\
  \ was a leap into the unknown within me . And when I walked down humming to myself\
  \  the same red flowers adorned humble local balconies of homes full of  kids and\
  \ sheep; their skin glowing in the amber sunset. We were a tribe in silent harmony."
