Text: "Not long after I discover that my host Olga, is an esteemed dance teacher;\
  \ Julia walks in the front door with a sigh. She is clad in black, wearing thin,\
  \ round glasses and ash blonde hair tied in a bun.  If her leggings and turtleneck\
  \ had been more robe-like, it would be easy to think she had returned from a school\
  \ for wizards.  I say hello and she gifts me with a warm smile and a gentle handshake.\n\
  \nWhilst not a student of magic, Julia is an aspiring tap dancer, training at the\
  \ Escola de Musica Luthier in Barcelona. Her sigh reveals the flat she\u2019s renting\
  \ is unliveable at the moment on account of rats and rotting floors. Luckily, Olga\
  \ has offered her apartment to Julia while the landlord fixes the problem.\n\nJulia\
  \ and I are fast friends.  Olga\u2019s balcony overlooks a quiet street in Navas,\
  \ a small suburb north-west of the Sagrada La Familia.  In this small pocket of\
  \ serenity, the crowds lining up to see Gaudi\u2019s architecture are nowhere to\
  \ be seen or heard.  All you hear is the gentle hum of traffic and autumn wind.\
  \  \nWe sit in cast-iron lawn chairs and drink green tea.  I tell Julia about my\
  \ Spanish journey to date, the six weeks left on my European itinerary, and my life\
  \ back in Australia.  She tells me about her home in Sweden, the tribulations of\
  \ a long distance relationship with her partner Zebastian, and her eclectic musical\
  \ taste. Julia introduces me to an electro-swing band called Caravan Palace and\
  \ proceeds to show me YouTube clips.  She stands to show me her dance moves to the\
  \ saxophone-heavy chorus, only her socks don\u2019t have the same sonic impact as\
  \ tap shoes.\n\n\u201CIsn\u2019t there something magical about moving your feet?\u201D\
  \ she asks.\n\nAt some point we realise that hours have passed.  The sun has gone\
  \ to its bedroom without us noticing.  We find pizza in a quiet restaurant next\
  \ to a playground in Navas, order dinner, and continue to find out about each other\u2019\
  s lives.  \n\n*\t*\t*\n\nOn the last night in Barcelona, I am headed to meet Julia\
  \ for her mid-semester party in a small bar nestled deep in the Gothic Quarter.\
  \  As I walk down the verdant tree-lined road of La Rambla, the city\u2019s atmosphere\
  \ is buzzing with revelrous football fans who have just witnessed Lionel Messi score\
  \ a hat-trick of goals for Barcelona.  Groups of young and old wearing the blue\
  \ and burgundy jerseys have permanent smiles engraved in their mouths, dancing down\
  \ the street.\n\nIt is an hour from midnight by the time I arrive at the Harlem\
  \ Jazz Club.  After navigating a few twisting alleyways, I find Julia inside bathed\
  \ in blue light.  We embrace and I buy us some beers.  She points out her friends\
  \ from the Escola de Musica Luthier who are on stage playing percussion, brass and\
  \ keys.  I meet some of her classmates who have come from other parts of Europe\
  \ to expand their creativity in this wonderful city.  I think to myself, how nice\
  \ it must be to find a home away from home to explore one\u2019s passion with other\
  \ creatives supporting each other.\n\nWe dance together, and I find myself paying\
  \ attention to feet.  \n\nAt some point we realise that hours have passed.  Julia\
  \ and I hail a taxi home to Olga\u2019s apartment. The neighbourhood of Navas is\
  \ still quiet and the sky is dark, but dawn feels as if it could break at any moment\
  \ now.  I thank Julia for the invitation to her party.  We talk in fatigued voices\
  \ before we are too tired to speak any more words.  \n\n*\t*\t*\n\nI say goodbye\
  \ to Julia the next day.\n\nWe say we will stay in touch, but international friendships\
  \ stop for all kinds of reasons.  We stay hopeful at the possibility of us meeting\
  \ again, though I also know the moment of friendship I experienced with her in Barcelona\
  \ exists in a universe I can only describe as timeless.  \n\nThe city of Barcelona\
  \ is beautiful.  When Julia danced her way into the story, her presence made the\
  \ place more magical than I could have imagined."
