Text: "Nothing holds greater power in our life than the Unknown.\nThe Unknown pulls\
  \ us towards new life experiences, new knowledge, new human relationships \u2013\
  \ a renewed and revitalized life.\n\nI would be kidding if I said Portugal isn\u2019\
  t one of my favourite destinations in Europe. Great food, great people, incredible\
  \ coast lines\u2026 there really isn\u2019t anything I don\u2019t love about this\
  \ country! I have found some standout favourites to encourage you to get there on\
  \ your next Euro adventure\u2026 so here they are!\n\n\n1. Lisbon\nStarting in Lisbon\
  \ is not only the most convenient\_way to get going with your visit to Portugal,\
  \ but also a great insight into what this country and its people are all about.\n\
  \n2.Sintra\nJust a short drive from Portugal\u2019s capital is the gorgeous, charming\
  \ little town known as Sintra. The buildings are playfully colourful and the small\
  \ cafe-lined streets are a great excuse to people-watch.\n\n3.\_Lagos\nIf you ask\
  \ me Lagos is where you will find the most impressive beaches in Portugal.\_\n\n\
  4.Douro\nIf you hire a car for your time in Portugal and want a beautiful region\
  \ to discover, check out the Douro Valley in the North of Portugal. The landscape\
  \ are absolutely stunning but as always in Portugal, the food and wine are just\
  \ as mesmerising!\n\n5.Pena Palace\nIf you make your way to Sintra, you absolutely\
  \ cannot miss Pena Palace, located high on the hill overlooking the surrounding\
  \ region. \n\n6.Porto\nOutside of Lisbon, Porto is one of the most popular cities\
  \ to visit in Portugal. With a medieval past and incredibly authentic riverside,\
  \ this is without a doubt one of the most gorgeous cities in Western Europe to discover.\n\
  \n7. Aveiro\nLocated on the West Coast of Portugal is this gorgeous, quintessential\
  \ coastal town that surprisingly is little-known. Expect canals filled with colourful\
  \ boats, intricate architecture and extremely welcoming locals. If you\u2019re looking\
  \ for a hidden gem to discover, this is it.\n\nXoxox\nHayyaa here"
