Text: "I have always considered myself a cautious traveler, not the type who would\
  \ follow a stranger home after a one-minute conversation.\nIt was two days before\
  \ Holi, the Festival of Colors in India. I was walking on the gritty, messy streets\
  \ from central Jaipur to Nahargarh Fort, passing shops selling heaps of dyes of\
  \ every color. My shadow on the ground was getting longer in the mid-afternoon.\
  \ So was another shadow nearby, which I had noticed for a good ten minutes. The\
  \ two shadows remained a few feet apart until they finally merged, with an Indian\
  \ girl walking next to me and started talking. She introduced herself as Bhavana,\
  \ 21 years old and going home from college. I told her I came from Hong Kong by\
  \ myself, and she asked me, \u2018Do you want to go home with me?\u2019 Surprised\
  \ by the quick offer, I didn\u2019t hesitate in taking it up even though it meant\
  \ Nahargarh had to wait \u2013 maybe forever since it was my last day in Jaipur.\n\
  Bhavana led me off the main road into a residential neighborhood. We negotiated\
  \ a warren of nameless, narrow alleys with small houses on both sides. After a few\
  \ twists and turns, we arrived at her place on the foothills of Nahargarh, which\
  \ perched on the clifftop in impregnable glory. \nHer house was modest but neat\
  \ and cozy, an oasis from the grime and noise outside. After having my fair share\
  \ of culture shock in India, Bhavana's home reminded me that we still had much in\
  \ common when it came to domestic life. The cuddly toys in her display cabinet just\
  \ looked like the ones I had at home, and her computer desk was almost the same\
  \ as mine.\nWe sat down and chatted away. I told her Indian food was too spicy for\
  \ my taste. She said she wanted to cook Chinese food for me. Before I could answer,\
  \ she dashed into the kitchen and whipped up some white, palm-sized pancakes with\
  \ a watery texture. I tried hard to figure out what kind of 'Chinese food' that\
  \ was when she fed a spoonful into my mouth. 'Do you like it?' She asked enthusiastically.\
  \ 'Yes, it's good.' I answered politely. I was so moved by her effort at making\
  \ me feel at home that I didn't really care how it tasted.\nAt first it was only\
  \ me and Bhavana, but we were soon joined by a string of curious visitors popping\
  \ in and out. My presence turned out to be a novel distraction in this otherwise\
  \ uneventful neighborhood. First came a couple of neighbors, then a friend, followed\
  \ by another friend bringing his 5-year-old brother, and still more until I lost\
  \ count. The house seemed to be shrinking and we had to move from the sofa to sit\
  \ on a bed before giving up sitting entirely. Those Indian youngsters were not shy\
  \ in asking personal questions \u2013 Why are you still single? Are you lesbian?\
  \ How much money do you make? They made me try out one of Bhavana\u2019s Indian\
  \ dresses and smeared some dye on my forehead to pre-celebrate Holi.\nAt one point,\
  \ word got out that the future father-in-law of a neighbor was coming over. The\
  \ atmosphere suddenly became subdued as the neighbor in question hastily pulled\
  \ up her scarf and tidied up her appearance. When the gentleman materialized in\
  \ person, he shook my hand and asked for a photo with me.\nThen I met Bhavana's\
  \ mom who came home from work. She said incredibly after hearing my story, 'My daughter\
  \ has never traveled by herself, and I would never allow that.' But then, her daughter\
  \ also did something that I had never done. I had never initiated conversation with\
  \ a tourist in Hong Kong, much less bring one home. Our culture taught us not to\
  \ trust strangers. When I was ready to leave, they sent me off with a statuette\
  \ of Shiva as a keepsake for good luck.\nMy trip in India was packed with exotic\
  \ sights, sounds and smells, but what stays with me is the time when I missed the\
  \ Nahargarh, the time when a complete stranger opened her home and her heart to\
  \ me."
