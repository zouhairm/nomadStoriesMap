Text: "The days before had been a flurry of activity for us. The mornings were filled\
  \ with workshops and training sessions, with the evenings spent wandering the city\
  \ together. Needless to say, our group had formed a special kind of bond during\
  \ the week-long forum.\n\nBut now here we were at the end, gathered at Tokyo\u2019\
  s enormous and complex Shinjuku Station after our final evening. From here we were\
  \ to disperse, with most of us destined to either of the two airports which service\
  \ the city for the journey back home. As I stood there, and before I even realized,\
  \ the people with whom I had spent every waking moment of the last week had gone,\
  \ almost as if in the blink of an eye.\n\nShinjuku Station is reputed to be the\
  \ busiest transport hub in the world, but never had I felt more alone, ironically\
  \ in this place full of people and hustle. Suddenly, I felt lost. Those of us returning\
  \ home knew exactly where to go. The week had passed by so quickly that I didn\u2019\
  t even have a proper chance to map out the rest of my journey, much less plan it\
  \ with my peers. All I knew was that this was my chance to explore the country as\
  \ much as I could while the month of March brought in the lovely blossoms the country\
  \ is so famous for.\n\nIt took me a few minutes to regain my composure, and to come\
  \ to terms with the fact that my friends had gone forth, and that the journey ahead,\
  \ for now, had to be taken alone. I tried finding solace in the prospect of adventure\
  \ on the road, though it was admittedly accompanied by a pang of fear, that of the\
  \ unknown. Night had set in, and I needed to know where to spend it. To find comfort,\
  \ I tell myself that whatever situation I may face going forward, as long as I keep\
  \ my wits, everything will be fine.\n\nAt that point I only had a hazy idea of the\
  \ places outside of Tokyo that I wanted to see. The famous and historical cities\
  \ like the Kyoto-Osaka-Nara triangle, and perhaps even Hiroshima with its Peace\
  \ Memorial and iconic restored castle? Sure, but what else lay along the way that\
  \ may be worth seeing, such as the elegant and picturesque Mount Fuji? I spent a\
  \ solid hour at the station deliberating such questions, structuring the coming\
  \ days in my mind.\n\nHaving knowledge of an area\u2019s past can be highly rewarding.\
  \ Before Tokyo (or Edo back then), nearby Kamakura had been the Shogunate\u2019\
  s centre of power from the 12th to 14th century, lending its name to an entire period\
  \ of Japan\u2019s history. Hence it would have a plethora of landmarks sure to sate\
  \ my thirst, both for history as well as nature. Lying due south at a train ride\
  \ of a bit above an hour, it seemed the most practicable place to go to, given the\
  \ time, and somewhere I could spend the next day peacefully exploring and planning.\n\
  \nGoing to Kamakura turned out to be just the remedy I needed to follow the excitement\
  \ and enthusiasm of the week earlier. At my hostel, I met a couple of traveling\
  \ Japanese schoolteachers, together with whom I saw the city and its iconic Great\
  \ Buddha statue. Cycling around town with them on the rolling terrain in the beautiful,\
  \ breezy sunny day reinvigorated my spirit. The temples and shrines of the quaint\
  \ city also had a calming effect. From the Buddhist Hase temple with a commanding\
  \ view of the surrounding area, to the alluring Shinto Sasuke Inari shrine with\
  \ its winding path up the hill covered with miniature \"torii\", I was left enthralled\
  \ by how much this small city had to offer.\n\nMy decision to visit Kamakura enabled\
  \ me to overcome my moment of anxiety and set me up for an unforgettable trip ahead.\
  \ I went on to see Mount Fuji, meet old acquaintances, and later down the road,\
  \ reunite with a few of my forum friends in Kyoto who turned out to be there. Just\
  \ like my personal travel motto, which says \u2013 \u201CNo matter where you go,\
  \ you will find friends\"."
