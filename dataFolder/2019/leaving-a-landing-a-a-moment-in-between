Text: "I could feel a change in the atmosphere. As the trays went up, I realized that\
  \ I was about to begin a new chapter of my life. We started to descend. I looked\
  \ out the windows, over the passengers who had joined me in the shared liminal state\
  \ of our row, to see if I could catch a glimpse of what was coming. Maybe there\
  \ was a clue there, some indication of whether I had made the right choice. The\
  \ clouds swirled around the edges of my eyesight like a picture frame around reality,\
  \ presenting an obvious work of art but an unclear image of it. Could I zoom in\
  \ on what was in store for me? Could I figure it out somehow?\n\nI\u2019d read all\
  \ 200-something pages of it, not thinking about what I was leaving behind or what\
  \ I was heading towards. The whole preparatory period had flashed by. Since take-off,\
  \ I\u2019d held on to a distraction from the fear of opening myself up to the world,\
  \ Valium for the anxiety of not being in control. I hadn\u2019t allowed myself to\
  \ wander to the questions I had been thinking about, questions I\u2019d probably\
  \ had since before I knew I\u2019d be on this flight. The passengers next to me,\
  \ Excited 1 and Excited 2 were getting more and more ready to begin their young\
  \ journey together, well I presumed they were together since I\u2019d swapped seats\
  \ with 2 a few hours earlier. Their passion was contagious, I wondered what they\
  \ were going to do in our destination. Could they know? Or were they too, like me,\
  \ unsure of everything but excited by the unknown possibilities of being somewhere\
  \ different. To my other side, Middle-aged Husband and Middle-aged Wife seemed to\
  \ have a sense of calmness about them that could only come with knowing exactly\
  \ where they would go and what they would do once we landed, just like I\u2019m\
  \ sure they\u2019ve done countless times before. Veterans of the jump into the deep\
  \ end, senior citizens of the sky. Or was there another reason for their calmness?\
  \ I could feel myself getting more and more excited now.\n\nI put my magazine away\
  \ into that small storage pouch, the one with no name on the back of the seat in\
  \ front of me, it\u2019d stay there with the in-flight material and my nearly empty\
  \ water bottle. I\u2019d leave it there, my Valium, there to delay the sense of\
  \ euphoria, the sense of enjoying the not knowing. I wouldn\u2019t need it in my\
  \ new chapter. I looked out the windows again, I could see details I hadn\u2019\
  t seen before, buildings creating a maze of opportunities for the wanderers and\
  \ the multicoloured vehicles down below us, navigating territory once unknown with\
  \ a casual curiosity. We were getting closer to the ground and closer to that moment\
  \ we would complete our journey as a row, those final seconds of our rite of passage.\
  \ I looked at the others. Did they know? \n\nI could feel the anticipation throughout\
  \ my body. Did anyone notice my heels sinking into the carpet, my back starting\
  \ to arch and straighten, my palms and elbows pushing down on the armrests. My heart\
  \ was beating faster, was it written on my face? The light above was sending a clear\
  \ signal to me, reminding me about a prior moment of inspiration, a flash of bravery\
  \ that had conquered me and created an irreversible path towards a permanent change.\
  \ As I stared at it, it stared back at me, like an ancient symbol known to those\
  \ who had been blessed with an understanding. An emblem, like a mark of inclusion\
  \ for those who have. Whatever happens when I jump out, I know that I won\u2019\
  t be the same as when I stepped in. I know it. I guess that\u2019s good enough for\
  \ now, maybe, that\u2019s all that you need to know."
