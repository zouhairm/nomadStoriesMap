Text: "It was just the sound of my shoes on the wet ground of a summer's day. I was\
  \ already at the top of the trail, immersed in the dark green of the Atlantic forest,\
  \ the smell of decomposed organic matter. A few miles away, I could see the beach\
  \ that existed only in my imagination, surrounded to the west by the plateau that\
  \ watched the waves breaking, in that golden light of the setting sun.\nThis was\
  \ the first time that I, from S\xE3o Paulo, have been trekking through Costa Verde,\
  \ in the state of Rio de Janeiro. From 12 million inhabitants to a small cai\xE7\
  ara community. The residents of Praia do Sono try to stay in perfect harmony with\
  \ the nature and the special characteristics of the place. The trash is properly\
  \ separated, composting is done right there, and once a week a boat from Paraty\
  \ prefecture arrives in the community to collect recyclable and non-recyclable garbage.\
  \ There are no roads, masonry houses, telephone signal and internet. Just the sound\
  \ of breaking waves, earthy canaries (traditional bird on the Brazilian coast) and\
  \ your own. \nStanding on my feet, the sand, transparent warm clear blue water that\
  \ was slowly tapping on my thighs. Inhabitants of this sea: sea slugs, mullets and\
  \ shrimps. Above, the rolling hills carved only by the climatic action. A moment\
  \ of consecration, as the locals do on most sunny afternoons.\nTo live here, even\
  \ if only for a while, you need to bring your food in enough quantity or face one\
  \ hour of boat (and spend some money) or one hour and a half of trail plus forty\
  \ minutes by bus to the nearest market. But the sense of community prevails in this\
  \ place, so it is possible that you come across a dinner that reunites all in the\
  \ camping. Like it happened to me, which (it\u2019s possible to find in some places\
  \ kitchen with stove) in addition to pasta with eggplant made by an Italian, gathered\
  \ solidarity from those who shared repellents and stories of a couple of Europeans\
  \ making a trip through South America. \nAt night the lights still can fail to manifest\
  \ themselves if the moon is full or a bonfire is lit to celebrate union and gratitude\
  \ to those who share that little piece of sand. I could thought of my life shared\
  \ individually in the great city of S\xE3o Paulo, brought by anxious thoughts, but\
  \ I just felt the positive energies, such as the followers of Buddhism believe,\
  \ of the constellations that together form the heterogeneous drawing and known until\
  \ then only in the classes of astronomy.\nIn the beginning, giving up modern conveniences\
  \ seemed simple and more colourful than in practice. But after the second day, also\
  \ as a form of safety manifestation of my brain, everything fitted naturally in\
  \ my lifestyle and was an opportunity to realize the impact on the environment and\
  \ my very essence, of the daily urban life. On the day of my return to home, the\
  \ sea was agitated, and the sky filled with gray clouds announcing my equally gray\
  \ destiny (with the pardon of the pun): the great city of S\xE3o Paulo.\nA simple\
  \ lifestyle loaded with positive energies and harmony with nature. Not only I did\
  \ leave there with the certainty of having found a place where all the academic\
  \ debates of ecologically correct societies come to fruition, but a conception of\
  \ the inner nature, the constitution of our essence, what we are, as Jean Paul Sartre,\
  \ while we live, we constitute ourselves."
