Text: "\"It's getting dark\", Kat shouted across from me. We frantically drove as\
  \ fast as we could on our little 125cc Chinese-made motorbikes, we had been driving\
  \ for approximately 7 hours on the enchanted Ho Chi Minh Trail and were now in Nha\
  \ Nghi. We needed to find a place to stay and it was usual not to see life for up\
  \ to 50 miles at a time, the darkness was the only thing that scared us here. We\
  \ had been weaving, turning and dodging passing cars and motorbikes as we tried\
  \ to make our way through the nearly 1,000 mile system of mountainous jungle paths\
  \ and trails used to bring weapons and supplies by the Vietcong from Hanoi in the\
  \ North to Ho Chi Minh City in the South during the Vietnam war. There were no traffic\
  \ lights and no signs, just the maps on our signal-less phones. \n\nA fairytale\
  \ in reality. The greens of the forests around us during the days that passed were\
  \ ethereal and both of us were caught breathless by the sheer isolation and beauty.\
  \ For miles upon miles, we got to see everyday life in rural Vietnam - a wide canvas\
  \ of picturesque mountains and animals strutting happily. There was a true warmth\
  \ I felt seeing this, knowing that humans can work together with nature rather than\
  \ destroy it.\n\nA couple of weeks ago we had decided to travel from the South of\
  \ Vietnam all the way to the top, I was in Australia working, and Kat was teaching\
  \ English to children in Vietnam. I stepped outside of the airport and a wave of\
  \ stuffy, humid heat hit me. There she was, waiting for me. I followed her into\
  \ a building where hundreds of bikes were lined up like soldiers. Over the next\
  \ couple of days, we looked for bikes - testing and searching with $200 to spend.\
  \ It was normal to say greet one another with \"xin ch\xE0o\", even strangers. Soon\
  \ we found a mechanic where we bought the two bikes from, he threw in his custom-made\
  \ shirt he had got from a remote village in Sa Pa, a beer and a helmet. As we waited\
  \ we conversated with a couple of the locals, laughing at our inability to speak\
  \ properly to them but loving it anyway. The mechanic gestured for me to start the\
  \ bike and drive it. We were ready.\n\nKat ended up spotting a house further up\
  \ ahead and we nodded to each other to stop, a gesture of communication without\
  \ words. We crawled along to a stop next to their little wooden gate and got off\
  \ our bikes; sweaty, wet and tired from being stuck on a muddy uphill dirt road\
  \ that wasn't paved liked most of the trail is. It had been spitting buckets of\
  \ rain and so we had to wade through brown shin-deep waters as construction was\
  \ happening in front of us. Two hours later we were out and dirty.\n\nA man and\
  \ a women came quickly out of their house to us and without a beat ushered us in\
  \ as if we had never been strangers. At that moment I didn't feel like a - ng\u01B0\
  \u1EDDi n\u01B0\u1EDBc ngo\xE0i - what they call foreigners in Vietnamese, but they\
  \ did make a common remark about my brown - ng\u01B0\u01A1\u0340i \u0111en - skin,\
  \ afraid of me getting too dark in the sun. Something I no longer took to heart.\
  \ It is customary here to cover yourself in order to stay as pale as possible. Despite\
  \ a language barrier, they let us know they would prepare a meal for us and while\
  \ we wait we could use their shower, a hut with a metal, irrigated roof. I and Kat\
  \ took turns bathing with their bucket. \n\nWhen we emerged, we entered their living\
  \ room and on the floor was a mat with bowls full of different kinds of local foods.\
  \ On the mat were four members from their family smiling eagerly at us. Their faces\
  \ a picture. Noodles, rice, fish, chicken. We were spoilt for choice. Using our\
  \ hands we dug in. \n\nOnce we were finished they cleared a room for us and left\
  \ us to sleep. I was blown away."
