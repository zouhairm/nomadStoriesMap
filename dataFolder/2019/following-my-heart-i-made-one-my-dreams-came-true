Text: "This story is to tell you about this little spot, still very unknown and not\
  \ popular place in Colombia that I discovered thanks to my crazy heart that made\
  \ me follow a special someone before he went back home from Cartagena in Colombia,\
  \ and that I visited for only 5 days.\nUpon my arrival we visited the beautiful\
  \ old city. Next day we went to the mood Volcano tour, which is a very unique experience,\
  \ where you can enter a mood pool, located inside a little volcano shaped mountain\
  \ of mood. Besides the detail of the locals, I think I never experience such a funny\
  \ thing. First, the sensation of mood, cold and warm in your body; second, the massage\
  \ the locals give you inside the same little pool; third, the \"I can not stay still\"\
  \ sensation is hilarious, everyone floats so much trying to grab whatever is near\
  \ to try to find a good position (yes, whatever means anything!, even your legs,\
  \ arms, or other parts of anyone's body, unintentionally of curse); and last; the\
  \ lady that washes you in the nearly lake, removing your swimsuit to their command,\
  \ feeling completely vulnerable just like everybody else. This whole experience\
  \ is followed by a lunch in another beach . \xBFWould I recommend this?, if you\
  \ are not so serious and can tolerate how locals attitude is, YES!, totally.\nThe\
  \ third day we wanted a nice beach but cheap, so we we went online and read in blogs\
  \ that Playa Blanca in Baru was the perfect spot if you stay outside the crowd.\
  \ We found a cheap (not so cheap) hostel, very simple and rustic to stay one night,\
  \ and we really enjoyed it away of the crowd and away the locals sellers (who I\
  \ must say, are really really annoying). Here was where my dream came true. I Knew\
  \ from before, that there are very few spots in the world to watch bio luminescence.\
  \ Just before I went to this trip I read there was a place called \"Laguna encantada\"\
  \ near Rosario Islands where u can see plankton that produces this effect, but only\
  \ in nights with no moon. However there was not much information about it, and all\
  \ I read was that you needed to stay in those islands to get a  boat, and Rosario\
  \ Island are more expensive than Baru, so I said, ok, next time!. But when we were\
  \ in the hostel,  I asked the Host about it, and he said: \"You can go from here.\
  \ If you wanna do it a boat will come for you later, I will call, just for 20.000\
  \ COP\".- Omg!!!, I got so excited and of course we said yes, after all, that night\
  \ there was no moon, and the clear perfect sky according to the host would make\
  \ it a great time to go. A simple little boat came for us around 6-7, there were\
  \ other 6 tourist in it, and we went on. We didn't know how long the trip would\
  \ be, I imagined would be so far cause I was thinking in Rosario Islands, but soon,\
  \ maybe after 10-15 minutes, I saw that the water beside the boat was reflecting\
  \ light. According to my partner, it was light from the boat to see in the night.\
  \ But no. It was the plankton. Soon we stopped; I could hear another boat and people\
  \ but didn't see anything, and the  driver said, OK, jump on!. I was the first one\
  \ of course and really, I can not describe that magic moment. Literally with every\
  \ movement you make you see the shinning. Its magical. No photo could get it as\
  \ you see it. We had such and amazing moment, and it was perfect cause its not full\
  \ of tourist, or boat that can damage the place. If you can do it now, do it!. \n\
  We went back next day afternoon to the city and we spent the rest of my stay there,\
  \ but for both; this was the best thing ever we have made in our lifes of trips.\
  \ I hope Colombia protects the place, from over exposition. And I hope you might\
  \ get to see it too."
