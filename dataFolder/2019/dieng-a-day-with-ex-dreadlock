Text: "At 8 AM, Dieng was still too cold for tropical person like me. After 13 hours\
  \ of road trip, my body was still fit for exploring this magical highland. Potato\
  \ farmers were going back and forth, but that\u2019s still so quiet. We enjoyed\
  \ a cup of tea from our host. What a perfect morning!\n\nDieng was more like a fairyland\
  \ and we decided to start our day by walking in the street until we met Slamet,\
  \ the local. He offered Rp150000 only for a whole day, very cheap for guiding group\
  \ trip. He explained clearly about Telaga Warna and Dieng Plateau. \n\n\u201CI am\
  \ Moslem in my ID. But I pray through meditation, I don\u2019t do shalat.\u201D\
  \ He said when we took Zuhur pray.\n\nI understood that. Every Indonesians had to\
  \ \u201Cchoose multiple choices\u201D to fill religion column on their identity\
  \ card, whereabouts there\u2019re 6 choices only: Islam; Catholic; Protestant; Hindu;\
  \ Buddha; and Khonghucu (Confucianism). As a traumatic impact of communist party\
  \ rebellion in 1960s, everyone had to fill religion column in order to ensuring\
  \ that they believe in God without asking \u2018Is their God include in that multiple\
  \ choices?\u2019.  Indonesian traditional believers such as Kejawen, Kaharingan,\
  \ Mahayana, etc, had to have big heart by admitting other religion as their identity.\
  \ Recently, Government gives option that traditional believers may include \u201C\
  Trustees\u201D as theirs. Well, at least people like Slamet doesn\u2019t need to\
  \ be forced being Moslem or anyone. \n\nThere\u2019s only noodle cup available for\
  \ our lunch, but deep fried of Dieng potatoes and mushrooms were perfect side dish.\
  \ During lunch, we talk about Dieng that people said as place of the God and Goddess\
  \ reside. Slamet was so fired to tell us about his childhood as one of dreadlock\
  \ kids. The dreadlocks are the chosen kids of Nyi Roro Kidul, Queen of South Ocean\
  \ in Javanese beliefs, who become well-being signs of Dieng. \n\n The wealthy Dieng\
  \ actually is a live crater, where earthquake and poisonous gas leak can happen\
  \ every time and kill living things on it. Fortunately, we just felt a little suffer.\
  \ After eat boiled egg fresh from the Sikidang crater, Slamet had a unique idea.\n\
  \n\u201CThis mud is good for your skin. Go try this as face mask\u2026\u201D the\
  \ ex dreadlock said.\n\n The sun had gone down when we finished our mud covered\
  \ face. But, the ex dreadlock had a brilliant idea (again).\n\n\u201CYou have to\
  \ wash your face in Arjuna Temple, guys.\u201D He said.\n\nOur imaginations blew.\
  \ I believed we would be taken to sacred fountain, the others thought will go to\
  \ holy lake. That\u2019s why Dieng is amazing, it could enhance anyone\u2019s imagination\
  \ until we didn\u2019t realize the mask had being dry.\n\nWe enjoyed sunset with\
  \ clown face, yes, the Sulphur clown with greenish face as salted egg be like. Dieng\
  \ at night was like dead village, almost no one on the road. Arjuna Temple is about\
  \ 2 km from Sikidang crater. The cold air started piercing the skin and fog drops\
  \ began lowering visibility, such of horror movie set with clown face ghost. Walking\
  \ like this made us feeling stupid. But, Slamet had his own way to avoid our curse\
  \ by driving us back and forth to Arjuna Temple. Our mask had become powder which\
  \ got into our eyes. Our imagination broke down after got ourselves taken to ablution\
  \ place. Oh my God\u2026 We got fooled again by our guide."
