Text: "I hope Axel doesn\u2019t read this.\n\nAfter an exhausting New Year\u2019s\
  \ Eve party experience that involved a five-course meal and trying to come up with\
  \ a polite way to say \"no more champagne, please\" in French, I slept in until\
  \ about noon on January 1. Classes were canceled, and so there was nothing in particular\
  \ that I had to do that day. I took lunch with my host family and their daughter,\
  \ and we chatted about what Kentucky was famous for. Turns out, they were familiar\
  \ with KFC and bluegrass music \u2014 which I guess, while not my favorite, aren\u2019\
  t the absolute worst things for the French to know your home state by.\n\nAfter\
  \ our two hour meal, I excused myself (for some reason, they wouldn\u2019t leave\
  \ the table until I said something about needing to go \u2014 which was a little\
  \ awkward, because I was afraid I was somehow forcing them to clean up before they\
  \ really wanted to). I told them I was going to go for a walk, which was absolutely\
  \ true.\n\n\nWhat I left out was that I was going for a walk to meet up with some\
  \ guy from town whom I matched with on Tinder.\n\nIt's at this point that I hope\
  \ Axel doesn\u2019t read this \u2014 I wasn\u2019t necessarily looking for anything\
  \ romantically in him, and I don\u2019t know if he was hoping that I was. I just\
  \ wanted someone to show me around Vichy, and in his bio, he mentioned that he was\
  \ studying English. I\u2019d been speaking French almost nonstop for three days,\
  \ and the opportunity to hold a conversation in my native tongue seemed like a relaxing\
  \ respite.\n\nSo I met up with Axel, who was a bit awkward, but an overall harmless\
  \ dude. He had lovely purple hair and a pretty French accent. I asked him to show\
  \ me around -- which was a little hard since it seemed like everything was closed\
  \ for the New Year holiday -- but he took me around to see a few places, like Napoleon\
  \ III's old summer home, that I hadn't seen in my initial tour of Vichy. Overall,\
  \ he was a pretty easy guy to talk to \u2014 though I definitely dominated the conversation,\
  \ perhaps simply because I was better at English.\n\nOf the two or three Tinder\
  \ dates I\u2019ve ever been on, I don\u2019t think I\u2019d rank it much higher\
  \ or lower than any of the others. I mean, the fact that it was in France made it\
  \ pretty cool \u2014 that was definitely a much more interesting location than the\
  \ time I got coffee with someone in a Subway.\n\nWhat was unfortunate, however,\
  \ was that after Axel and I parted ways, I somehow lost my glasses. Somehow, in\
  \ between meeting Axel in front of the university and parting ways at in the park,\
  \ my glasses disappeared. My first guess is that they just fell out of my pocket\
  \ at some point was we were walking along, meaning that there\u2019s no chance that\
  \ I\u2019m going to get them back.\n\n\nMy second guess, though, is that Axel stole\
  \ them. Why would my Tinder date steal my glasses? I don\u2019t know. Maybe as a\
  \ bargaining tool for getting a second date. But Axel, if you happen to read this\
  \ \u2014 which I kind of hope you don\u2019t \u2014 I\u2019d really like my glasses\
  \ back s\u2019il te pla\xEEt. Je dois voir, et il n\u2019est pas probable que nous\
  \ nous reverrons d\xE9ja. Tu peux rendre mes lunettes maintenant."
