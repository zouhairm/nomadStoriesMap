Text: "A hope brought me there. Seeing grandeur masterpieces with my own eyes. Casa\
  \ Batllo is only one of them, one of city\u2019s most celebrated architecture. I\
  \ celebrated too, as soon as I secured 3 entry passes on my hands and lead the way\
  \ to destination. We supposed to have pleasant walk towards lavish area Passeig\
  \ de Gracia, yet agitated by folks carrying senyera estelada, catalan flag. Soon\
  \ they multiply by hundreds and thousands, sea of human ahead of us, blocking the\
  \ way. In that moment everything is real, we were stranded among those crowds of\
  \ independence movement, chanting llibertat or freedom. While I and my sister trusted\
  \ our guts to keep on going, my mother asked for a retreat. On our point of view,\
  \ they were merely mix of young and old people gathering together without any harms,\
  \ yet a mother always think beyond. Lost in her fear, we dragged her by joining\
  \ our hands, holding tight on each other, passing through the tight labyrinth of\
  \ people. Feeling alive by courage, a thriumph over fear, we were taking a chance\
  \ of freedom to follow our vision with responsibility, no matter how it took us\
  \ until we arrived. We were safe, finally."
