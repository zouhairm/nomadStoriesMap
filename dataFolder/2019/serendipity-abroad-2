Text: "After an especially difficult day at my new ESL job, I was questioning my life\
  \ choices. My choice to try living in Japan; my choice to follow through with that\
  \ idea; even my choice to continue any type of existence. My fellow trainees were\
  \ all giddy and joyful about their upcoming assignments and all I could think was\
  \ how I had been told I have, \u201Cbad timing,\u201D\n\nand I believed it.\n\n\
  I left work feeling dejected, dumb, and like a sack of dubious decisions based on\
  \ a debaucherous and flawed mind that should just be dumped altogether.\n\nThe train\
  \ I needed to take back to Kurumamichi was already at the station when I walked\
  \ down the steps. I hesitated, thinking it was going to pull off before I could\
  \ jump on, but the doors stayed open so I sheepishly entered. Someone or something\
  \ was keeping the doors from closing. They would try to close, then shudder back\
  \ open. I hadn\u2019t seen this before and I could tell it was unusual by the faces\
  \ of my fellow commuters. After what felt like an entire minute, an hour in train\
  \ time, the doors closed and we were off.\n\nOnce I was off the subway and walking,\
  \ my mind tried to find a focused thought but couldn\u2019t. All I could manage\
  \ was questioning myself, and at the same time trying my best not to think about\
  \ anything until I got home.\n\nMy mind and I zigzagged through the cement subway\
  \ halls until I reached the exit into the upper world. Up the many flights of exit\
  \ stairs the cool night air was waiting for me. It tossed my hair and howled as\
  \ I approached.\n\nAt the bottom of this pyramid of stairs, a mother with her baby,\
  \ plus an additional toddler were starting their effort to climb these steps. By\
  \ herself, it would\u2019ve been very difficult. However, right as I was turning\
  \ the corner and saw this, I also saw an older Japanese man step in to help. Together\
  \ they carried her baby stroller, complete with baby, all the way up the subway\
  \ steps to the top; her other small child climbed up close behind. This was about\
  \ three flights of steep stairs, it\u2019s hard to simply walk up sometimes let\
  \ alone carry anything.\n\nI saw this simple act of kindness at exactly the right\
  \ time. A few seconds before or after and I would\u2019ve never seen it. If the\
  \ doors on that train had been working with no interruption I would\u2019ve never\
  \ seen that moment.\n\nCall it what you want, fate or coincidence, but I call it-\n\
  \nwhat I needed.\n\nAfter a crushing day, that moment really gave me back a little\
  \ burning flame of hope that maybe I am in the right place. Even though I am a little\
  \ fish in a big foreign city, maybe I am still in the Japan that I\u2019d always\
  \ hoped I\u2019d be in.\n\nMaybe I was meant to see that moment and...\nmaybe my\
  \ timing isn\u2019t so bad."
