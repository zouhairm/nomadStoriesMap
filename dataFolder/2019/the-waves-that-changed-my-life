Text: "It was November 2018, when my roommates and I decided to have a weekend trip\
  \ to Sayulita, a famous beach here in Mexico. We did not have much money so we decided\
  \ to camp on the beach and live the experience. We bought a bus ticket and went\
  \ to San Francisco, a beach 20 minutes away from Sayulita to spend the night. We\
  \ arrived at night, we set the camp and had a pizza for dinner with some beers.\
  \ The stars above us were something magical that we had not seen lately due to the\
  \ pollution in the city that we live in. We swam in the sea for a while, had some\
  \ breakfast and had a good time together. The next day we arrived to Sayulita, fortunately\
  \ we found a friend of ours over there that was staying in a Tortoise camp and she\
  \ allowed us to leave our luggage and to camp in there with the only condition of\
  \ helping them to take care of the egg turtles that would hatch. We agreed and were\
  \ excited to help.\n\n The hatch was booked for the sunset so we went to eat something\
  \ and relax a little at the beach, later that day we went to the tortoise camp and\
  \ started our job. They explained us how the turtles reproduce, the danger the species\
  \ have been through lately, how we could help and all the information we needed.\
  \ The hatch was a success even though there were many curious tourists watching\
  \ the event. We released the turtles to the sea at sunset without a problem. It\
  \ was magical to me, to see such little animals facing fearlessly the wide ocean,\
  \ something inside me changed. We did a turtle release three days in a row. In total\
  \ we released about 500 baby turtles that weekend.\n\n On Saturday morning, we found\
  \ a turtle nest really close to the camp, the eggs looked like ping-pong balls but\
  \ much more fragile. We helped the camp staff take the eggs to a safer place: the\
  \ incubation room inside the camp facilities. I wish I could describe how touched\
  \ I felt holding those eggs in my hands. I held the beginning of a life. \n\nOn\
  \ Sunday, we organized a beach clean-up with the tourists and any local volunteer,\
  \ it took us around 5 hours to walk along the coast picking up the trash that was\
  \ left by people. It was the first time that I saw so much trash gathered, and so\
  \ close to the sea. We found a lot of things, I remember lots of disposable cups\
  \ and plates, wires, Styrofoam, cigarette butts, plastic bags and bottles, a keyboard,\
  \ tires, shoes, a broken surfboard, a fishing rod, a chair, a thong, condoms and\
  \ even 200 pesos that we used to eat later. No joke, we found all those weird items.\
  \ I was shocked, I could not imagine how all those objects ended up in the seashore,\
  \ I felt really bad about it, especially after knowing that the day before I released\
  \ 500 baby turtles into that dump, how many of them are going to survive?\n\n I\
  \ wanted to help in any way that I could, so i started by making some changes in\
  \ my lifestyle, in order to be more ecologic and reduce my ecological footprint.\
  \ I started talking to my friends about this important issue that is affecting the\
  \ wildlife, including us. I began with myself and now I am trying to change someone\
  \ else\xB4s mind. Step by step, little by little, I know we can change the world.\
  \ I had to live this experience to realize what is currently happening, and that\
  \ is why I know that Sayulita changed me, and it was the best trip I have ever made."
