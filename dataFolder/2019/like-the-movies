Text: "\u201CYou can read what you have written, but you can\xB4t write it again\u201D\
  , said the aged but seemingly tireless man. We shared paths and our bodies were\
  \ weary as we strolled amongst the narrow path, hugging the sunlit rocks. The autochthon\
  \ bushes danced upon the trees limbs through vast and expansive Spanish hillside.\
  \ The narrow path met the rolling hills and vineyards, and the sunset tinted the\
  \ little grapes, the leaves and the trees through a red and gold autumn shine.\n\
  I understood him clearly. Two days before, we were passing the city on Ponferrada,\
  \ and I was stunned with the medieval castle in the heart of the city. Haven\xB4\
  t you been there? Well, believe me: you should. I felt as though the city had secrets,\
  \ and deep within the majestic region of Le\xF3n, the order of the Knights Templar\
  \ felt alive and real. We had walked more than 500 km, crossing the Pirineos, going\
  \ trough the vibrant Pamplona street and conquering the far stretched highways until\
  \ Le\xF3n. This castle was the paradox of reality, space and time. Home to the brave\
  \ warriors and monks of the past, who belonged to the Catholic Church. It was so\
  \ powerful and rich that they bought the island of Cyprus.  \nIn the beginning they\
  \ protected the pilgrims of Jerusalem, so, when I saw such a huge castle appearing\
  \ suddenly in the middle of the shops, the streets and the people, I dropped to\
  \ my weary knees praying for protection. I have injured my knee close to Pamplona\
  \ and I had stop walking for many days.  I wouldn\xB4t reach Jerusalem, but in this\
  \ case, Santiago de Compostella like many others, had become my Holy Land.\nThe\
  \ engineering, the harmony and indestructible structure showed why they were more\
  \ strategic fighters than enlightened seekers. The mysteries of the carefully considered\
  \ fake entrances, and the tales of the double entrance created to deceive the enemy,\
  \ created time to position for combat upon the highest point of the hill, next to\
  \ the river (only accessible from the castle) was the masterpiece of this powerful\
  \ gentleman. Just 100 metres away, the fancy coffee shops and merchandising venues\
  \ reminded us of the present, not the haven of activity five centuries before. This\
  \ was no movie.\nI had read enough to know the terrible end to those who competed\
  \ and threatened the Pope and the kings: they were accused of blasphemy -among other-\
  \ and burned alive in the bonfire. The legendary Jacques de Mulay were burned in\
  \ the centre of Paris, and the prophetic words to their executioners - Pope Clement\
  \ and Philip IV of France- saying they would be dead before a year. And so, it happened.\
  \ They were too powerful, but the story was already written; and their fate was\
  \ sealed.\nBut we can keep walking. Our next stop would be O Cebreiro, in the next\
  \ province of Galicia. The Celtic ancestry remains. The houses are built like fungi,\
  \ and circular, and low with straw rooves and, perfect for dwarves, gnomes and any\
  \ kind of mythological being to seek refuge. The people are extremely kind and the\
  \ spark in their eyes shows me that they have special secret, maybe the same that,\
  \ according to the cronics, give the miracle to become wine in blood in the close\
  \ church of Santa Maria. Like most constructions on the Camino, the Church is built\
  \ with stones with a rectangular and square posture. The catholic church in middle\
  \ of the Celtics construction showed the influence of the Crown, and the two worlds\
  \ appear in front of the pilgrims, as a choice: religion, or spirituality: not easy,\
  \ and we need keep walking.\nBut to read our past episodes, we need good food. We\
  \ don\u2019t remember details, the context or the size of the city of Melide. We\
  \ just remember the best seafood ever. But, again, we keep walking. Still I would\
  \ have many days to reach Santiago, and then, \u201Cthe end of the earth\u201D,\
  \ the famous \u201CFinisterre\u201D.\nThis was the Camino, the same pilgrim that\
  \ had walked the Celtics first, the Christians, and now travellers like us. Thankfully,\
  \ we can read the past and add some pages in our present. Buen Camino!"
