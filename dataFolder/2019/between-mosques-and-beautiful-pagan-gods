Text: "Chapter 1 (Istanbul, Turkey) \n\n              At a time when my life was full\
  \ of monotony, problems and frustrations, someone \u2013 a friend of a friend of\
  \ mine - published on social media a call to people that where interested in recording\
  \ a \"reality show\" in Istanbul, Turkey. As so many times, I applied that call\
  \ with a strange fight to death of hopes: on one hand the timid, nervous, childish\
  \ and fragile hope of living a different adventure that could change my life forever\
  \ and on the other hand a suspicious, distrustful, frightened and hypocritically\
  \ insensitive hope trying at all costs that nothing disturb his insufferably depressing,\
  \ but comfortable, reality.\n\nAgainst all odds and even against my unconscious\
  \ desire to continue living without emotion in my \"life\", I was accepted and asked\
  \ to take a flight to Istanbul the next day. As luggage I carried a backpack, a\
  \ suitcase to check in, fears, complexes, taboos, myths and many doubts, some of\
  \ those mine and some from another\u2019s; the scapular that a Catholic father gave\
  \ to his Christian son to travel to a Muslim country and the blessing of a mother\
  \ who, in tears, say good bye to me like it was the last time she would see me leave;\
  \ some threshed advices and other deep and wise ones. << with all that I\u2019ll\
  \ pay for extra luggage by sure >> I thought, but I didn\u2019t.\n\nAbout the show,\
  \ I will just say that it was canceled after three days of recording and that it\
  \ gives me the intimidating experience of being who I am in front of 40 cameras\
  \ that would judge with critical eyes my way of being, like that bacterium that\
  \ is analyzed in a microscope. I had no choice but react to the stimuli of the observer,\
  \ as I would react in my natural environment. However, at the end of the show, the\
  \ adventure began and it would tell me more about myself than the countries I visited.\n\
  \nIf we had to define Istanbul with a single word, it would undoubtedly be \"magic\"\
  . The strait of the Bosphorus divides aesthetically and subtly the city and two\
  \ continents that come together to become a single living being when all the mosques\
  \ of the city invite you (five times a day) with sublime chants that echo in every\
  \ corner, every stone, and every heart, to remember that everything that happens\
  \ is always and simply thanks to God; the feeling is so overwhelming that you can\u2019\
  t do more than turn your face to the sky and smile with the risk of a restless tear\
  \ jumping from your eyes and splashing the old streets of the city as a tribute\
  \ to the creator.\n\nWhat you need to know about mosques is that they were built\
  \ by people who were convinced to please God (Allah) with what they did and the\
  \ stones carved with perfect symmetry, the gouge that carved the wood on the doors\
  \ and the hands that wove the rugs that cover the floor knew it. The human being\
  \ wanting to imitate the perfection of the universe knowing that he will never achieve\
  \ it, that is a mosque. To say that it is necessary to respect them with the established\
  \ formality and the faithful cleaning their face, their hair, their ears and their\
  \ feet with cold water before occupying them is understandable knowing what was\
  \ said before.\n\nPeople in Istanbul are ... unique. It seems that they want you\
  \ to know that they are a flash of God in every act or word, for example \"g\xFC\
  le g\xFCle\" when you say goodbye literally means \"leave smiling\" or giving you\
  \ peace in a difficult moment saying \"Yalan Dunya\" which means \"the world is\
  \ a lie\" and that is used relatively as an everyday expression. The people in Istanbul\
  \ are unique because of the smile of their men making an effort to understand your\
  \ lousy Turkish or your useless efforts to say something with an English that they\
  \ neither practice or know; for the beauty of its women used to seduce with their\
  \ eyes that speak by winks and don\u2019t need anything else, the people of Istanbul\
  \ is unique."
