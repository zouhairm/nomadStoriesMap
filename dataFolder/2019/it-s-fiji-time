  \ more \u2013 thinking back to our Fiji trip feels like popping into a little bubble\
  \ of paradise.\nAt the airport we were greeted by such warm smiling people that\
  \ it didn\u2019t matter waiting in line for a few hours to get through customs.\
  \ With a warm \u201CBula\u201D we were taken to our shuttle and soon found ourselves\
  \ on our first sightseeing tour while heading to the resort we were staying at.\n\
  The people were remarkably lovely. What touched me most is that a lot of them don\u2019\
  t have much. Yes, we get to see the beautiful images of Fiji, its stunning landscape\
  \ and escapes. But a lot of the people who live there actually don\u2019t get to\
  \ enjoy these things. Most of them work hard, long days every day, and still they\
  \ greet you with a gorgeous smile and share their stories with you as if they had\
  \ all the time in the world.\nOur driver had so much information to share about\
  \ Fiji, its people, history, that I couldn\u2019t help but ask more and more questions.\
  \ One thing we learned quite quickly was Fiji time \u2013 don\u2019t stress and\
  \ take things easy. Everything runs a bit slower, but eventually gets done. If the\
  \ bus didn\u2019t arrive on time, no one seemed to worry or get frustrated \u2013\
  \ it will turn up sooner or later. And in the meantime you might as well start walking\
  \ towards your destination and let the bus pick you up along the way. Simple as\
  \ that.\nI guess that\u2019s one of the learnings I took away from our trip: some\
  \ things we simply cannot control, but it\u2019s our choice whether we want to stress\
  \ about them or move on and continue doing other things instead.\n\nWe were staying\
  \ in a small Bure (bungalow) at First Landing Resort right by the ocean surrounded\
  \ by coconut trees and beautiful flowers so diverse in their colors and shapes that\
  \ you wouldn\u2019t know where to look first. But not just at the resort \u2013\
  \ everywhere you would find the most stunning flora.\n\nOne highlight for me definitely\
  \ was the amount of fruit growing basically just around the corner. Bananas, huge\
  \ HUGE mango trees, papayas, passion fruits, pineapples and so many more yummy goodies\
  \ growing alongside the roads. Honestly, I would happily live off those, because\
  \ they were incredibly delicious.\nAfter enjoying some good swims at the beach and\
  \ going on a few kayaking explorations, I was overwhelmed when diving in the ocean.\
  \ The sea life was a whole new world meeting Nemo and his plenty colorful friends\
  \ in real, but not just that. The coral reefs were breathtaking. And spending a\
  \ lot of our time in or right by the water, we got very lucky to meet some freshly\
  \ hatched turtles. Getting to discover the ocean from a completely new angle, even\
  \ though we only got to see a very tiny bit, fascinated me. There is so much happening,\
  \ so many amazing creatures, plants, and other organisms, that we don\u2019t even\
  \ notice in our day to day happenings, but are linked to all of us and what we do.\n\
  \nAll of this was topped when entering the Garden of the Sleeping Giant. Hidden\
  \ away this garden proved once again what an impressive architect Nature is. After\
  \ walking through an alley of over hundreds of different orchids, the path led into\
  \ a tropical rain forest presenting Fiji\u2019s flora from its most gorgeous side.\n\
  \nMy heart was filled with excitement and I felt very lucky to experience such mind-blowing\
  \ moment. Being in an almost heavenly surrounding like this; breathing in the fresh\
  \ air filled with flowery scents; hearing birds chirping and singing away above\
  \ us; feeling the hot sun on my skin. \nA simple, but yet so powerful moment. It\
  \ made me forget that I was a tourist visiting a foreign country. I simply enjoyed\
  \ and appreciated that particular moment.\nIt made me think that no matter where\
  \ we are, or were we come from, there is always an opportunity for us to enjoy what\
  \ is given to us."
