Text: "The illustrious exhilaration of that word, \u2018travel\u2019. Naturally we\
  \ associate it with unremitting energy, constant commotion, and an ingrained desire\
  \ to conquer a new city each day. But for you globe-trotters who perhaps, like myself,\
  \ need to pause and breathe it all in, I found that a couple of days spent floating\
  \ down the English channel was just the well-deserved rest I needed. \n\nPicture\
  \ this, that sporadic English sun has kindly decided to pop its head out for the\
  \ weekend. You\u2019re meandering down the tranquil British canal on your own floating\
  \ house, wide open fields spread out like a patchwork blanket and willow branches\
  \ dipping their fingers into the water. There\u2019s no one else in sight, just\
  \ a couple of local boats moored up on the banks and the sound of your motor purring\
  \ gently as you drift along. One of you steers from the stern of the boat (a skill\
  \ you can later add to the resume) whilst the others laze around on the roof or\
  \ admire the view from the bow. A rather soothing image, right? \n\nNow one thing\
  \ that certainly makes you stand out as tourists is your ability (or in my case,\
  \ a sever lack of) to navigate the many locks you come across on your route. For\
  \ those uneducated in nautical terminology like myself, a lock is this mechanism\
  \ for getting boats down the river for stretches of water that differ in levels.\
  \ The navigation of these river devices involves strength, coordination, and general\
  \ knowledge about the way water flows in a river. Needless to say, I was asked to\
  \ remain on the boat during these lock encounters and to merely give moral support\
  \ to those who knew what they were doing.\n\nNaturally after such strenuous work,\
  \ we sailors need well-deserved refreshments, and as luck would have it every few\
  \ kilometres you can moor up outside a good old traditional English pub and pop\
  \ in for a pint. Now one of the things I cherish most about the British countryside\
  \ is the sense of community, which reveals itself in these little pubs nestled along\
  \ the canal. The entire village gathers there on an evening, and they welcomed us\
  \ tourists, albeit whilst paying out our Aussie accents. We stopped at the sweetest\
  \ little restaurant on our first night, the \u2018The Rock of Gibraltar\u2019, with\
  \ potentially the best local food I\u2019ve found in Britain (definitely not the\
  \ greasy pub grub I was expecting).\n\nThe only downside to our blissful little\
  \ weekend was the impatience of the more stubborn locals. I get it, you\u2019ve\
  \ retreated from busy city life to enjoy a relaxing summer in the countryside on\
  \ your well-groomed boat, all is tranquil and lovely. Then a bunch of ignorant tourists\
  \ show up with little clue as to how to navigate a narrowboat and knock into the\
  \ side of you (gently, I might add). But as I said, these things don\u2019t go above\
  \ a snail\u2019s pace and they\u2019re built for a little wear and tear. So please,\
  \ have some patience. We\u2019re not trying to play dodgem boats and getting a thirty-metre\
  \ vessel around a tight bend is not easy for the irregular skipper. Save your remarks\
  \ for the intentionally bad drivers please.\n\nWe hired our boat from Oxfordshire\
  \ Narrowboat Hire (http://www.oxfordshire-narrowboats.co.uk/oxford.html) with eight\
  \ beds on board and two bathrooms. Yes, you have to go single-file down the hall\
  \ way and yes, the beds aren\u2019t wide enough for you to be an aggressive sleeper,\
  \ but hey it\u2019s an experience! The family who owned the boat hiring company\
  \ were tremendously helpful and friendly, and they gave us a crash course on navigating\
  \ before we set off. \n\nSo, if you need to take a step back from the flurry of\
  \ playing the conventional tourist, the hyperactivity of hostels, and the effort\
  \ of navigating buses and trains, this serene English getaway is certainly one I\
  \ would recommend. Though perhaps not my idea of a permanent residency, this boating\
  \ weekend has taught me that it\u2019s certainly worth taking time off in a peaceful\
  \ escape to recharge the batteries, before heading back out into the endearing craziness\
  \ of worldwide exploring."
