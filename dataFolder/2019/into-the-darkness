Text: "It was 1991, and a friend offered to watch our kids so we could go out to dinner\
  \ for our anniversary, when my wife said, \u201CWhat\u2019s the point?\u201D and\
  \ I knew that our 12-year marriage was likely over.  Pan Am was offering cheap flights\
  \ to anywhere in the Caribbean.  Trinidad and Tobago were as far off the tourist\
  \ track as you could get and I decided to take my ten-year old son, Justin, on an\
  \ adventure; perhaps, a last hurrah. \n\nThe two of us wandered around Trinidad\
  \ tasting foods, exploring white sand beaches and bubbling tar pits, and learning\
  \ about a new culture.  We ended up the Trinidad part of our trip at Asa Wright\
  \ Bird Sanctuary, an old copra plantation returned to its natural state.  The sanctuary\
  \ has guest cottages and an old plantation house.  Screened windows surround the\
  \ house and outside are bird feeders right at the window.  You sat on benches by\
  \ the windows and colorful doctor birds flash their intense blue, red, and green\
  \ colors within inches of our faces.  We hiked jungle trails extending out from\
  \ the house with a guide who pointed out assorted plants and animals.\n\nOn our\
  \ last day we were leaving the sanctuary headed to the coast to take a boat to Tobago.\
  \  As we were driven out of the Sanctuary we saw several workers on the side of\
  \ the road.  Our driver stopped as we approached them and they drew, from the bushes,\
  \ the body of a long brown and black snake.   The snake was the color of mud with\
  \ black markings and a triangular head.  It was about seven feet long and as wide\
  \ around as one of the workmen\u2019s upper arms.  \u201CBushmaster,\u201D our driver\
  \ said.  This, I knew, is one of the world\u2019s deadliest snakes and it was one\
  \ of our last sights before leaving Trinidad.\n\nFrom Trinidad we took a ferry to\
  \ Tobago.  We wandered around Tobago, spending our first night in a small village,\
  \ a former pirate town.  At sunset a steel band began playing on the edge of town.\
  \  They made music, tapping out the beat on steel drums and assorted auto parts.\
  \  They invited Justin to join them, I saw the happiness on his face and my eyes\
  \ welled with tears as I wondered what the future held.  \n\nA few days later we\
  \ stayed at a beach resort along the water in Speyside.  Justin and I decided to\
  \ walk up a dirt pathway into town to have dinner in a restaurant in a tree house.\
  \  The front is a regular restaurant, but you dine on a platform behind the restaurant\
  \ built on several trees.  Our seafood dinner was good, but was slow to arrive and\
  \ by the time we finished it had gotten dark.  \n\nWe headed along a street lit\
  \ by a few, intermittent streetlights, back to the resort.  We reached the trail\
  \ down to the resort and I realized that the last streetlight was at the top of\
  \ the trail.  A rock wall lined one side of the trail and about a quarter of a mile\
  \ below I could see the lights of the resort, but the trail, itself was dark.  At\
  \ the base of the last streetlight was curled a black and tan three-foot boa constrictor.\
  \  I remembered the bushmaster and wondered what might be along the trail. I put\
  \ my son on my shoulders and told him to sing, hoping that anything in front of\
  \ us would hear us coming and head in some other direction.  I stepped out onto\
  \ the trail; into the darkness."
