Text: "I\u2019m the worst secret-keeper I know. My partner guesses all my surprises,\
  \ yet I attempted to plan a trip to Belize as a surprise anyway. I did it, but barely.\
  \ \n\nI slipped up. What else would you expect from a horrid secret-keeper? He figured\
  \ out I was planning a surprise and I decided to roll with it. I devised a cover-up\
  \ plan: I threw him a surprise party and tried to make him think that was it\u2026\
  \ I\u2019d say it was about 63% effective. But this is the story of our first day\
  \ in Belize.\n\nSurprise #1: a 3:00 a.m. wake-up call.\n\nIn Belize, we slung our\
  \ heavy packs over our shoulders and hopped in a taxi to the bus station where we\
  \ were greeted by friendly locals. With the warm sun on our cheeks and the scents\
  \ of garlic and curry in the air, it was impossible not to match the Belizeans\u2019\
  \ enthusiasm with our own huge smiles. \n\nOn a new friend\u2019s recommendation,\
  \ we got a boxed Belizean lunch of red beans and rice from inside the bus station\
  \ to quell our hunger. Then we walked ourselves outside and onto a retired American\
  \ school bus headed to San Ignacio.\n\nThere was a strange familiarity on that old\
  \ school bus. We instinctively pulled down the windows to allow a cross breeze as\
  \ we had done hundreds of times during our school days in Florida, and we were greeted\
  \ by the familiar smell of diesel. But then the bus driver and attendant hopped\
  \ on, and we snapped back to the present moment.\n\nIt was a three hour, partially-paved\
  \ trip across the country from coast to jungle. As we bounced along, I noticed that\
  \ the landscape felt strikingly familiar with only a hint of the unknown. The rolling\
  \ hills and small towns we passed felt like it could be Puerto Rico, but nothing\
  \ could\u2019ve prepared us for the striking beauty of Mayan temples gracing the\
  \ horizon. \n\nWe arrived in San Ignacio and set up our campsite in a small, family-owned\
  \ permaculture farm. We finally had time to slow down and appreciate the journey\
  \ we had already taken. I certainly felt a sense of pride in keeping a secret I\
  \ wanted to give up hundreds of times, and my partner was faring exceptionally well\
  \ considering he had no clue what his Tuesday was going to look like the Monday\
  \ evening before we hopped on a flight to Belize.\n\nIn a handful of hours, we had\
  \ escaped from the cold, dry air in Denver and were surrounded by the sounds of\
  \ birds and critters in the jungle, basking in the comfortably balmy tropical sunshine.\
  \ \n\nIt felt like magic. \n\nAs a civil engineer with a passion for urban resources,\
  \ my partner was fascinated by the crops surrounding us. The owners of the farm\
  \ taught us about the crops they were growing, and how the arrangement of the farm\
  \ mimicked the way crops support each other naturally in the wild. They had almond\
  \ trees, cacao trees, aloe plants, and plenty of food we had never even known existed.\n\
  \nWe immersed ourselves in the local market across the street from our campground.\
  \ The market was full of life from the time it opened to the time it closed with\
  \ farmers, artists, families, music, locals, and other travelers. We stopped to\
  \ chat with just about every vendor and ask what they were selling, and bought anything\
  \ we hadn\u2019t eaten before. \n\nOur favorite was the sapodilla fruit. It looks\
  \ like a sweet potato but tastes like the most buttery, decadent sweet potato casserole\
  \ you\u2019ve ever had - marshmallows and all.\n\nAt the end of the day, we walked\
  \ up to the top of the hill in San Ignacio, surrounded by pastel blue, pink, yellow,\
  \ and orange shops, houses, and restaurants. The further we walked away from the\
  \ town center, the quieter it got. Everything was illuminated by the soft, warm\
  \ light of sunset as we looked down on the town and the jungle around us. \n\nAt\
  \ the top of the hill in the final rays of sunshine, I finally realized why Belize\
  \ felt so familiar: it felt like home. That was the biggest surprise - for us both."
