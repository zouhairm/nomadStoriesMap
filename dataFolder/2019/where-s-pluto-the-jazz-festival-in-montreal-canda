Text: "My British-American family and I are already avid travelers who are Bruce Willis\
  \ Die-Hard level foodies and lovers of music, so finding that a Jazz Festival takes\
  \ place annually in Montreal, Canada was like hitting the bullseye. The first time\
  \ my family and I were in Canada, we did the tourist things such as see Niagra Falls.\
  \ Although it was beautiful, my family and I were not meant to be just tourists.\
  \ My family and I loved diving head first into the culture, foods we've never tried,\
  \ and history left out by the textbooks. That's why, the next time we went to Canada,\
  \ Montreal was our first choice. \n\nDuring the summer, Montreal is the place you\
  \ cannot miss. Jazz music spilling from every corner of the warm city, you physically\
  \ cannot stop dancing. The Jazz Festival is free to everyone, which is why everyone\
  \ loves it. However, it is not so crowded that you cannot move. There are security,\
  \ food stands, huge open venues, and amazing music all the time. French is a plus,\
  \ however, do not fret if you are like me and unable to say one French word. English\
  \ is used regularly, and it's so amazing to see people switch between two languages\
  \ with ease. Whether you want a sit-down smaller venue like the Club Jazz, or a\
  \ large concert feel like the Honda Stage, you can feel welcome at every moment.\
  \ \n\nAfter you finished dancing the afternoon away, the evening rolls in and your\
  \ hunger start to gnaw at you. No fear, Montreal is where you can get whatever cuisine\
  \ you are craving. Chinatown is walking distance from the Jazz Festival if you want\
  \ to stop by and have handmade dumplings or dip into eclectic African cuisine of\
  \ fried fish and cuckoo. Brazilian, Cuban, Asian, French, and German restaurants\
  \ are super easy to find by walking around and looking at where most people are\
  \ lining outside. After a hearty and savory meal, having a sweet crepe is the best\
  \ way to end your Jazzy day. Only two minutes away, there is a myriad of crepe cafes,\
  \ where you can still listen to the distant jazz music while having a hot, sweet\
  \ crepe on a nice summer evening. \n\nMy family fell in love with the bustling and\
  \ warmhearted city of Montreal that for five years we have been back to the Jazz\
  \ Festival. Maybe next year, I'll also see you there. \n\nStay safe, and keep eating!\
  \ \nSincerely, Pluto."
