Text: "My late grandfather had a reckless streak that occasionally drove him to seek\
  \ needless danger, beyond logic or rationality. You either recognise that feeling,\
  \ or shake your head in disbelief.\n\nIt\u2019s late Autumn in the Austrian Alps,\
  \ on the border with Germany. This wasn\u2019t an ordinary morning. It was the day\
  \ I pledged myself to what I gleefully knew to be a very bad idea. I had set my\
  \ sights on a picturesque village on the German side of the mountains. With extensive\
  \ hiking to some of the surrounding peaks, I\u2019d discovered a system of trails\
  \ across the mountains that while unmarked, could be followed with GPS. I plotted\
  \ the route \u2013 25km, with close to 2000m of elevation gain. Madness \u2013 more\
  \ than I had ever trekked before with my full pack. Based on the hikes I had completed\
  \ previously I judged that, although not impossible, the trek would be hellishly\
  \ uncomfortable.  These were remote, deserted trails far beyond phone reception.\
  \ I\u2019d have to set a hard pace all day if I was to have any chance of arriving\
  \ before nightfall. And losing the trail or breaking an ankle could quickly turn\
  \ into a life-threatening situation. I couldn\u2019t wait to get started. (Thanks,\
  \ Grandad.)\n\nThe climb through the alpine forests that clad the lower slopes of\
  \ the Alps is breathtaking, and all the more uplifting due to having everything\
  \ I own on my back. Nothing to tie me to that sordid little human world that lies\
  \ below, with its traffic and social media and fashion and anxieties, its pathetic\
  \ need for attention and stimulation and validation. The air is clear and cold and\
  \ almost sweet, and I close my eyes just to fully appreciate drawing each breath.\
  \ The wind through the pines creates a wondrous deep sigh, punctuated by the calls\
  \ of deer that echo across the valley. It\u2019s also a world of smells; damp earth,\
  \ pine sap and deer musk. We so rarely use our noses that it\u2019s like opening\
  \ a whole new world of sensory information. My sense of self melts away and I\u2019\
  m a part of it all; the texture of the pine needles beneath my feet and the mountain\
  \ air deep in my lungs.\n\nA tremendous, alien sound suddenly shatters the peace.\
  \ A series of sirens, blasting in unity from villages all along the valley floor.\
  \ The volume is incredible, even at this distance. It could only come from some\
  \ purpose-built system; and that the sirens emanate from multiple villages in perfect\
  \ synchrony reinforce the growing feeling that this must be an emergency of impressive\
  \ scale.\n\nAfter several minutes, the wailing (almost identical to WWII air raid\
  \ sirens) abruptly stops. Perhaps it was just a system test? Then it starts again,\
  \ and this time it doesn\u2019t stop. And that feeling that something very serious\
  \ indeed has happened continues to grow, despite my logical side fighting against\
  \ it. And as those sirens continue to blare, my logical side has less and less plausible\
  \ scenarios to offer as explanation. There\u2019s not enough snow on the peaks for\
  \ any risk of an avalanche. No smoke on the horizon. And of course, no phone signal\
  \ to do a Google search.\n\nAnd so, looking down on the world from my high perch,\
  \ I wait for the event. What would I see? Mushroom clouds blossoming on the horizon,\
  \ followed by a shockwave that would knock the trees flat? An earthquake rending\
  \ the ground around me? A volcano spewing rock and fire into the air? Fighter jets\
  \ screaming overhead?\n\nDisbelief and scepticism still held their ground. Cataclysms\
  \ simply don\u2019t happen to people like me, except in movies and dreams. And yet\
  \ I had walked through the cobbled streets of Pompeii only several weeks before\
  \ and seen the ghosts of those trapped in the ash, Mt Vesuvius still lurking menacingly\
  \ in the distance. Did they also have this feeling of disbelief when the mountain\
  \ began to rumble, this inner voice telling them that apocalyptic events simply\
  \ don\u2019t happen to ordinary people like them? Stuck in that vacuum of information,\
  \ with nothing to guide me but the incessant sirens shattering the air, I cautiously\
  \ let myself believe that maybe, just maybe, this was the real thing."
