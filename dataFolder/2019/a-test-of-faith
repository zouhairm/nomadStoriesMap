Text: "A biting wind charges through the air, whistling as it slices along the street\
  \ and onto the flinching Danube River. Looming opposite, the usually chalky coloured\
  \ buildings of \u0160af\xE1rikovo Square have withered almost to grey. Only the\
  \ piercing headlights of the trams cut through the weight of the mist, rattling\
  \ past as we stand frozen in line \u2013 waiting. \u201CDon\u2019t worry, they\u2019\
  ll definitely have it. They have to have it,\u201D promises Lizzie, my recently-found\
  \ Texan travelling companion. The trouble is, we\u2019re not exactly sure what \u201C\
  it\u201D is we are waiting for.\n\nWhat is certain is that I am here to taste the\
  \ only vegan doughnut in Bratislava. What is not certain is what it looks like,\
  \ what flavour it is, or if it even exists at all. My Germanic vocabulary is useless\
  \ against the Slovak daily menu glowing teasingly on my phone. At this point, for\
  \ 45 minutes, I had let the elements batter my new, warm-blooded friend, snow speckling\
  \ her dark hair as we huddle behind the crowds of people in line at La Donuteria.\
  \ It is Valentine\u2019s evening, and it seems others have had the same idea.\n\n\
  In the afternoon, we had been sheltered within the baby blue walls of the St. Elizabeth\
  \ Church. Candles had draped a golden filter over the devoted, gathered in prayer\
  \ under the oil-painted form of Lizzie\u2019s namesake. She said it was important\
  \ for her to maintain her faith while we were away. Mass had begun. A crimson carpet\
  \ cushioned the path of the thurifer to the alter, chanting as he swayed the burning\
  \ incense, its aroma drifting through the pews alongside the soothing echo of his\
  \ voice.\n\nNow, our noses are overwhelmed with wafts of dough sizzling away in\
  \ deep fat fryers in a kitchen we cannot see. Through the jungle of coats I spot\
  \ a proud figure emerging, a dozen box clutched tightly between his gloved hands.\
  \ A part of me is delighted that we\u2019re one person closer to the bakery; another\
  \ is despairing that they are twelve doughnuts closer to running out. This seems\
  \ to escape the attention of the cluster of young French girls in front of us, whose\
  \ excited gossip struggles to travel past their layers of knitted scarves as they\
  \ edge further into the shop. We cram in through the doorway behind them. \n\nDespite\
  \ being the coldest season in Slovakia, the queue is almost exclusively made up\
  \ of tourists \u2013 an Italian family of five, a loved-up Asian couple keeping\
  \ warm in each other\u2019s arms, us. Record numbers of visitors are flocking to\
  \ Bratislava this year. Few among our ranks are adapted to withstand the stabbing\
  \ gusts and leaden clouds, but La Donuteria serves up the most photogenic desserts\
  \ in town, making it the prime font of Instagram-able material this Valentine\u2019\
  s Day. Selfie tourism is big business. And so, swapping thurible for wallets and\
  \ phones, Lizzie shuffles along with me in the procession to receive my sugar-dusted\
  \ circle of bread.\n\nOne customer claims their boxed reward, then another, and\
  \ another, until finally it\u2019s our turn to stand in front of the wooden counter.\
  \ A flustered, kind-eyed woman greets us with a smile, wiping her forehead and leaving\
  \ a trail of icing sugar above her pencilled brow. \u201CWhat can I get for you?\u201D\
  \ she exhales. \n\nI skim the labels on the surviving doughnuts though the glass\
  \ cabinet, desperately looking for a sign that one might be vegan \u2013 a green\
  \ tick, or perhaps a simple \u2018V\u2019. My heart sinks when I find nothing. In\
  \ the end, it\u2019s not so much about the dessert, but the thought that I had submitted\
  \ my friend to a sub-zero endurance test in vain. I sheepishly enquire, and the\
  \ cashier points to a lone ring shining through the glass: Sladk\xE1 Malina. Its\
  \ vibrant raspberry gloss rivals the rosiness of Lizzie\u2019s half-frozen cheeks.\
  \ \n\nWe squeeze onto a table just big enough to hold our prize. The glazed pillow\
  \ of dough fills my taste buds with anticipation. I take my picture. But, looking\
  \ over the neon-pink icing passing my lips at the face sitting opposite me, still\
  \ beaming despite my selfishness, I ignore the barrage of \u2018likes\u2019 pinging\
  \ across my screen. Today, I\u2019ve found something sweeter."
