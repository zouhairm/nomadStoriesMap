Text: "The Unexpected F\xFCssen.\n\nIn 2011, I challenged myself to travelling to\
  \ another continental, Europe. Especially going to Germany and exploring some cities\
  \ there. My travelling partner and I made 3 different trips. An Eastern Germany\
  \ trip ( Berlin and surrounded area ), a Western Germany trip ( D\xFCsseldorf, K\xF6\
  ln, Essen and surrounded area ), and a Southern Germany trip ( M\xFCnchen, F\xFC\
  ssen, Rothenburg ob de Tauber, N\xFCrnberg and surrounded area ).\n\nWhat impressed\
  \ me the most is my experience to visit this magical castle who inspired Disney\
  \ to make their \u201Ccastle\u201C logo. The castle itself called Neuschwanstein,\
  \ a Bavarian castle located in Hohenschwangau in southern Germany.\n\nThe castle\
  \ was magically breathtaking! The surrounded area was so beautiful, because it is\
  \ located in a pretty high hills / mountains area. I personally think that a full\
  \ day pass ticket isn\u2019t enough to explore the castle. So when I came down from\
  \ the hill where the castle placed, I felt a little bit sad because I feel like\
  \ I want to spend more time there.\n\nWell, my disappointment didn\u2019t stay longer.\
  \ As soon as we are going back to downtown, try to looking for our booked hotel,\
  \ I am breathless! My travelling partner decided to rent a hotel room in a small\
  \ city called F\xFCssen. And that was the best decision for our southern Germany\
  \ trip. Within 10 minutes car trip, the surrounded view all the way from Neuschwanstein\
  \ castle to our hotel was epic. It was scenic!\n\nI know, although you may say,\
  \ the other cities in Germany or the rest of European countries might look the same\
  \ or even better, but for me F\xFCssen is memorable. As an Indonesian girl, who\
  \ never have a trip to out of my country, never travelling far away from my hometown,\
  \ and only visiting some cities in Germany, I can say that F\xFCssen is one of a\
  \ kind.\n\nBerlin is a total metropolis life. D\xFCsseldorf, K\xF6ln, Essen was\
  \ typically a city for students. M\xFCnchen and Rothenburg ob der Tauber are very\
  \ beautiful also with the historical buildings, the cultural vibes. But they are\
  \ very common places and full of tourists. N\xFCrnberg was a calm city to live peacefully,\
  \ but I personally think you can\u2019t really see anything there as a tourist.\n\
  \nBut this F\xFCssen, Oh my beautiful F\xFCssen! It is a totally different city\
  \ than all the cities that I have visited in Germany. It surely a tourism area too,\
  \ but I felt like F\xFCssen is not as crowded as the other tourism city. I think\
  \ because most of the tourists decided to have a visit to Neuschwanstein at daylight,\
  \ but going back to stay at hotel around M\xFCnchen.\n\nI thought F\xFCssen will\
  \ be a boring city, but I changed my perception after stayed there. I stayed in\
  \ F\xFCssen for several days. Every single day I woke up, look up the window, saw\
  \ the buildings surrounded, when looked up a bit, I can see the hills and mountains,\
  \ and a glimpse of the castle up on the mountains, felt like I am in an imaginary\
  \ village. Like a Disney princess. Haha.\n\nWalking a bit from our hotel, there\
  \ was a river and bridge that was famous and tourism photo spot. There are also\
  \ several groceries places, souvenir stores and restaurants around. You can easily\
  \ find your needs there. I can imagine myself living there for longer time. Running\
  \ a small business related to tourism and hospitality because it is near to Neuschwanstein.\
  \ Wake up every morning and still living the dream.\n\nI only spent a month to be\
  \ on holiday in Germany. That was the most precious time in my life. That trip really\
  \ opened up my mind, improved my English, and I couldn\u2019t asked for more to\
  \ God at that moment. Every single thing happened in my Germany trip was a blessing.\
  \ I am beyond grateful. I was the happiest girl on planet.\n\nYunita Putri Anggraeni\n\
