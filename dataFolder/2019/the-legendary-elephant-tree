Text: "In the Naya Quila premises of Golconda Fort in the City of Nizams, stands a\
  \ majestic Baobab Tree with its branches hovering over the ground as if guarding\
  \ its historicity. My discovery of this tree was purely by chance. While looking\
  \ for an autorickshaw to Paigah Tombs I happened to meet Mr. Mohammed Aijaz, an\
  \ auto driver cum tourist guide. It was because of him that I could visit this fascinating\
  \ tree I had never head about.\nIt was quite a task to reach the place. The narrow\
  \ and curvy lanes that seemed to go round in circles were completely a maze. There\
  \ was no network, and we were lost. By asking the locals, we somehow managed to\
  \ reach our destination. The tree was located a few kilometers away from the old\
  \ Golconda Fort near the Hyderabad Golf Association\u2019s Golf course. Passing\
  \ by the lush green premises of the golf course surrounded by the historical walls\
  \ of Naya Qila is an experience in itself. It felt so calm and peaceful because\
  \ this place is not very popular with tourists. There was a scent of modernization\
  \ intermixed with the history of Hyderabad. Mr. Aijaz told me that he grew up in\
  \ this place. There used to be wilderness in place of the golf course. His voice\
  \ had that nostalgia for something lost and replaced. His eyes still searched for\
  \ that wilderness in the golf course. \nWhen I saw the tree, it was majestic and\
  \ beautiful. With a circumference of about 25 meters, this tree is the second of\
  \ its kind in the world (the other Baobab tree is in Africa). The locals call it\
  \ \u201CHathiyan Ka Jhad\u201D (Elephant Tree) as its thick stem looks like the\
  \ body of an elephant and the branches look like its several trunks. It is said\
  \ to be more than 600 years old. The tree is originally from Madagascar in Africa,\
  \ and the legend has it that the wandering friars planted it as a gift to Sultan\
  \ Muhammad Quli Qutub Shah during their stay in Golconda many centuries ago. \n\
  The more I looked at the tree in its magnificence the more my imagination played\
  \ tricks on me. The branches looked more like dragons to me than the elephant trunks.\
  \ I spent almost an hour walking on the ruins of Naya Quila and near the tree. It\
  \ was so peaceful that I did not have any thoughts at that moment. I was just there\
  \ in the moment and did not want to be anywhere else. \nThis old tree is unique\
  \ because its trunk has two rooms carved inside it. Mr. Abdullah who looks after\
  \ the tree told me about the legend associated with the tree that during the reign\
  \ of the Qutub Shahi rulers, there used to be forty notorious thieves who would\
  \ hide inside the tree trunk during the day and come out at night to carry out their\
  \ criminal activities. For many years nobody could catch or find out the where they\
  \ hid. One night, someone happened to see a streak of smoke emanating from the premises\
  \ of the fort where the tree stands. The soldiers were immediately sent to look\
  \ into the matter. On following the streak of smoke, soldiers reached the tree and\
  \ saw that it is coming from inside its trunk. The thieves had lit the fire for\
  \ cooking food which led to their fatal end. They were caught and taken to the King\
  \ the next morning. The King ordered them to be hanged from the tree. (He was not\
  \ sure if they were hanged from the same tree or from a different one.)\nMr. Aijaz\
  \ had a very different explanation for the two rooms inside the tree. According\
  \ to him, the Queen and the children of the royal household along with some guards\
  \ used to hide here during the times of war when the King would go to the battlefield.\
  \ However, the space inside the trunk has shrunk over the years and therefore, it\u2019\
  s difficult to believe that it could house as many as forty people.\nNo matter the\
  \ truthfulness of the legends, it was quite an unexpected discovery existing between\
  \ the modern civilization and ruins of a glorious past."
