Text: Life takes a very random turn sometimes, that you have never expected of or
  you have never ever dreamt of. My travel story started when I was working in Hyderabad
  9 to 5 job creating content for a website, I wanted an escape but I was never a
  traveller like I have never thought of coming out of my small comfort box, sometimes
  life hits you on your face and wakes you up and we call it "the calling " how much
  ever cheesy it may sound but it's true, that night it happened to me. I came back
  home packed my bag and left to the mountains and mountains gave me my answers, they
  heard me cry, they saw me dance, they spoke to me too,  since then I have been traveling
  across the country, meeting new people, learning new things, gaining new perspectives,
  hugging bears, fist fighting monkeys, paragliding from highest peak, bleeding in
  a fight pit, making new friends, getting tattooed, being a part of a secret club,
  climbing bolders and ice, trekking up the Himalayan range in -16 degrees, ,  finding
  unknown beauties of nature. Traveling changed my view towards life, it gave me an
  adventure that I was looking for my whole life, I have so many stories to tell,
  I have so many memories that I might  have not  been able to capture but I lived
  them. Above all I have learnt one thing that is not to live with regrets in life.
  I have stopped living life in regrets, this moment, this day, this second is mine.
  But   This one time I met a bunch of Israeli traveller group who had this weird
  custom of challenging for a dual fight before taking any Stranger into the group,
  as we all know that it's a compulsion for Israeli civilians to serve in army for
  two years, I was just a usual chap with little boxing skills, this fight did scare
  the Shit out of me but I stood against him, although I got some bruises on my face
  and I lost the fight, I did make them good friends and I got their respect and eventually
  ended up having a tattoo on my body, it was painful but worth it. And once while
  I was trekking up a hill I lost my way and ended up in a village which normal people
  don't know that it exists, there I hugged a bear, it was scary, cozy, smelly but
  it was fun and it was a tamed bear by the villagers in Hindi we call them "dholak
  wala" So ya this is some of my adventures I did while solo traveling, this is my
  travel story.
