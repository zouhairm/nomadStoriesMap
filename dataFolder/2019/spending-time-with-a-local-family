Text: "In summer of 2013 I was 26 years old and I made a trip to Europe. Actually,\
  \ I was travelling with a Jewish program called Taglit. I flew from Argentina to\
  \ Israel with a group and we stayed there for two weeks. After that, I travelled\
  \ almost three more months to Europe.\nI had a friend that was living in Berlin,\
  \ so I visited her, and this is how the story I want to tell started.\nMy friend\
  \ had met a Turk guy named Volkan. He was living in Istanbul, but he was born in\
  \ a little village called Denizli in the western region of the country, and his\
  \ family lived there. I don\xB4t remember how, Volkan has invited me to Denizli\
  \ to visit the baths of Pamukkale, an important touristic place, declared by UNESCO\
  \ as world heritage.\nAs it is a little village, the traditions are very strong\
  \ than in the big cities like Istanbul. To start, they are Muslims and it was new\
  \ for me because I came from a Jewish family in a Catholic country. \nIt was hot,\
  \ to hot, so I was wearing shorts and a muscle shirt. I am blond and my skin is\
  \ very white with freckle in my body. So, I was walking in the streets and I could\
  \ feel how people stared at me, especially old women. I didn\xB4t feel comfortable.\n\
  Five times a day a speaker from the mosques called everybody to pray. The first\
  \ night I jumped out of the bed, because it was so loud and it was 5 am!\nI stayed\
  \ for four days with Volkan and his family -parents and a brother. They were really\
  \ nice and hospitable but they didn\xB4t speak English, just Volkan. It was stressful\
  \ but we managed to understand each other.\nThey spent their free time in the balcony\
  \ sitting in rugs or cushions on the floor. They drank a lot of tea and they eat\
  \ a lot too. They gave me some cartons of tea and other presents.\nI was a bit uncomfortable\
  \ with the father, but he was okey. In Argentina we love football \u201Csoccer\u201D\
  . One of the most important teams is River Plate, that is my team. One famous player,\
  \ Ariel Ortega, was part of a Turkish team. The father, in his incomprehensible\
  \ language, named him and I was so astonished to hear his name in a far away, different\
  \ country.\nOne day, the aunt, uncle and an eight-year-old cousin were invited.\
  \ We were in the balcony \u201Cchatting\u201D in the way we could, and I think they\
  \ tried to set me up with the boy, with the eight-year-old boy! They pointed at\
  \ me and them pointed at him and they join both index fingers together. \nOther\
  \ day, the brothers had a wedding and they invited me. In Argentina, you need an\
  \ invitation to go to an event like that, so I asked a lot if It was really okey\
  \ to go. \nI didn\u2019t know how to dress, because in Argentina, when you have\
  \ a big party, we go elegants, with a dress, accessories and heels. I didn\u2019\
  t have clothes like that, and I didn\u2019t know if I should cover my body. But\
  \ the guys told me to wear whatever I want, and I wore a simple black dress.\nWhen\
  \ we arrived, I realized why they were so calm about that. Some people were dressed\
  \ formally, but a lot of them wore a simple jean with a blouse our shirt.\nIt was\
  \ food and music as in other party and the guests gave money to the couple as a\
  \ present or gold in little pieces.\nOther day, we went out, me and the brothers.\
  \ We ate, we drank beer and we dance. I realised and then they explained to me that\
  \ guys there were different of the rest of Europe. Actually, they seemed Argentinians.\
  \ If you are alone at a bar, they speak to you and try to get your number, and this\
  \ doesn\xB4t happen in other countries of Europe. \nI think that Turkey is in the\
  \ middle of cultures, they are open mind like occident, but they have also a strong\
  \ connection with the religion, especially in little towns."
