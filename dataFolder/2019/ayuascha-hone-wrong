Text: "I walked into a shamans house to find that I was indeed alone, far from my\
  \ expectations and my home. It had been a journey I\u2019ve been wanting to undertake\
  \ for 10 years now so I wasn\u2019t back in out. My Spanish flooded in as my English\
  \ was kept at bay and I conversed until the large glass of ayuascha I drank merged\
  \ with my blood. I could see bright light, colours of all dimensions and shapes\
  \ and patterns I could describe except they transformed into humans and I was literally\
  \ on another universe. I committed my guts out and thought I was going to die! I\
  \ could see the news headlines and my body in a coffin. I was drained of fluids\
  \ and thought I would dehydrate to death. At this point, I just had to switch to\
  \ survival mode and whenever I was back in the real universe, I grabbed my phone\
  \ and planned my rescue by sending my location on WhatsApp to my friend in the city\
  \ who I was living with. I made the shaman speak to him until he was given exact\
  \ directions. I tried running out of the gates but transformed into a jaguar and\
  \ had to slow down and return to my human consciousness. It felt literally like\
  \ I was out of this world. For the very first time, I experienced co-existing in\
  \ parallel universes and like I was dying. I could see the end of my life. What\
  \ should have lasted 3 hours lasted 18 hours and I had to catch my 26 hour flight\
  \ back home the next morning!"
