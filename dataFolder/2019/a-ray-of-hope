Text: "There is beauty in everything. Even in uncertainties and getting into unknown\
  \ territories just for the sake of it, if you ask me. That morning itself had started\
  \ with clouds of uncertainty hovering on our heads. We were in an unknown, remote\
  \ Himalayan village for two days. It was raining incessantly since we arrived. Not\
  \ having seen a clear sky for so long made me ask the locals if it really rains\
  \ that much usually. Their answer was non-affirmative.\n\nThe only purpose of my\
  \ visit to Mudh in Pin valley was to have a glimpse at the rugged mountains and\
  \ the barren landscape that looks extraordinary when sunlight shines upon them.\
  \ And with every passing minute, I saw that hope diminishing. I wished that somehow,\
  \ I get to stay here a day or two more as I walked towards the departing bus leaving\
  \ for Kaza. The engine roared and our bus started moving but my gaze was fixated\
  \ out the window. The mountains on both sides, their distinctive brownish maroon\
  \ colour, a river quietly flowing in between, the tiny white mud houses on raised\
  \ lands at the base of the mountains. All this was straight out of a dream. This\
  \ picture was getting smaller in front of my eyes. I tried to gather this moment\
  \ in my eyes and memory as much as I could, but it never really touched my heart.\
  \ Maybe because of my idea of how the landscape would look like when I decided to\
  \ come here. It was drizzling all the time, and everything was gloomy.\n\nAfter\
  \ just 5 minutes, a ray of sunshine appeared to fall on one of the mountains. This\
  \ was a glimmer of hope for the hopeless dreamer in me. Then the bus took a sharp\
  \ turn and with it; my fortunes as well. A big piece of rock was lying on the road\
  \ which meant the bus couldn't go further. The sun was coming out slowly at the\
  \ same time. Now I could see the possibility of having my wish fulfilled. The bus\
  \ took a reverse and we were back in our homestay. I quickly ran to the terrace\
  \ that gave me the best view. Befitting for a fairytale, this view blew me away.\
  \ The brownish-maroon mountains had turned into gold. All the greenery and the rooftops\
  \ of homes were glowing with a lively shade of yellow. The aura of this whole setting\
  \ changed within minutes as the sun came up. That's the closest I've ever witnessed\
  \ ecstasy. Then I remembered a quote from 'The Alchemist' that I had read just a\
  \ day before. 'It's the possibility of having a dream come true that makes life\
  \ interesting'. How befitting! We could've walked further ahead till the next village\
  \ when our bus had halted due to the landslide, but I insisted on returning to Mudh\
  \ because I chose to believe in the slightest hope left in me, that I could still\
  \ witness the splendid beauty of those mountains. My faith was rewarded, and I couldn't\
  \ be happier. People might think, it is crazy to travel so far just for a panorama\
  \ (?!) but the inner child in me was jumping with joy while I marvelled at all this\
  \ magic that was unfolding in front of me. It was as if, the sun came up just for\
  \ me. A conspiracy to make my wish true.\n\nThis particular day always reminds me\
  \ that diving into the \u2018Maybes\u2019 of life is a better choice than choosing\
  \ safer options to settle down. If it goes well, you'll have the time of your life.\
  \ Even if it doesn't, you'll learn your lesson for all the good reasons. At least,\
  \ there won't be any regrets. After all, that's the beauty of uncertainties. One\
  \ that's worth chasing."
