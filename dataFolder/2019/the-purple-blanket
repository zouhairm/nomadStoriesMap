Text: "There is nothing quite like the hug of a well-worn blanket. A protector from\
  \ the cold, a security device, a makeshift seat on grassy terrain \u2013 a blanket\
  \ simply feels like home. \n\nThe colours and sounds of Cusco, Peru are perfectly\
  \ magnified in the handy-work of the locals. The streets are alive with strings\
  \ of vibrancy, as blankets line the stalls of the crowded market. Women, whose hands\
  \ are as storied as the buildings around them, quickly sew together patterns that\
  \ represent the Inca culture. The imperfections only make them more intriguing.\
  \ I choose one in purple.\n\nMy blanket serves its purpose in more ways than one.\
  \ Indeed, it keeps me warm on a particularly frigid night while sleeping outside\
  \ under the watch of The Andes \u2212 but its scope reaches far beyond the traditional.\n\
  \nThe kitchen of my host\u2019s apartment is small, but inviting. Bathed in warm\
  \ colours, and overlooking the weathered rooftops of Cusco, it\u2019s hard not to\
  \ be distracted while the matriarch of the family tries to teach me the basics of\
  \ a good ceviche. The community is having a dinner that evening, and I am learning\
  \ from one of the best. As we begin to load our delicacies into the hands of some\
  \ eager helpers, we realize our Aji de Gallina is still far too hot. Enter the purple\
  \ blanket and its one-time spell as an oven mitt. My blanket still wears a small\
  \ stain from a bump in the road on our way into the darkness.\n\nAs the end of my\
  \ time in Peru approaches, I am told that I am going to receive a blessing from\
  \ the local shaman. The weight of the moment is not lost on me during the hike to\
  \ the ceremony site. The trek is long and tiring, and my group is clearly unprepared.\
  \ One of my fellow travelers, who has been carrying a frayed backpack for weeks,\
  \ finally feels the give of his strap. With another few miles to go, my purple blanket\
  \ turns into a makeshift sack, its patterns staring back at me as we walk through\
  \ the dusty hills.\n\nWhen I lean back in my chair, I can feel the fabric of my\
  \ blanket against my shoulders. It\u2019s not as soft as it once was, and it\u2019\
  s colour is slightly faded. I work to chase the memories of my time at the top of\
  \ the world. All I can see is purple."
