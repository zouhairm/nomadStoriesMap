Text: A mystical country with gems of spiritual and cultural attraction is what's
  in my mind when thinking about India. Starting from a simple thing, seeing the tourism
  commercial on TV years ago, it drove me to visit India someday. Furthermore, the
  festive video clip of a song titled Hymn For The Weekend by Coldplay which was published
  in 2016, even teases me more. Going through all the preparations as well as responses
  from my inner circle questioning 'Why India?' with all the concerns and bad publicity
  on the media, I just didn't care that much anymore. Then in 2017, it finally happened.
  Along with a friend, I landed in New Delhi, India. I let myself embrace every moment
  in exploring cities, through all the good and not-so-good things. Strolling around
  the city, visiting local markets with all the bustle, seeing mesmerizing iconic
  buildings with intricate details and vibrant colors, talking to talkative drivers
  and pushy merchants, eating local foods, taking public transportations, meeting
  local fellows and had a scintillating conversation, and also getting scammed - those
  were really precious to experience. New Delhi with its beautiful mess, Agra with
  the majestic Taj Mahal that gave me goosebumps when stepping on its marble flooring,
  Jaipur with its appealing historical buildings, and Mumbai with its urban and lavish
  vibes. This trip truly gave me a deeper understanding and acceptance of the other
  rhythm of life. In the end, every trip reminds me about Gustave Flaubert's saying
  that travel makes one modest, you see what a tiny place you occupy in the world.
  Cheers to another incredible trip!
