Text: "For the average citizen in Western countries, the concepts referring to workers\
  \ rights or human trafficking are usually terms that encompass social realities\
  \ that lost their original meaning. As a consequence of a too theoretical policy\
  \ that lacks a historical perspective, the meaning has been redefined while losing\
  \ the connection with the citizen. They are concepts that are believed overcome\
  \ for a hypothetical debate in western democratic systems and that have little to\
  \ do with the social movement of the twentieth century that really boosted them.\
  \ Even less probable to analyse the phenomenon if we apply them to situations in\
  \ which people seek a better future away from their homes, the immigrants, who are\
  \ presented as destabilizing factors instead of help providers. In parallel, if\
  \ the concept of \u201Crefugee\u201D comes up, the average Western citizen, a middle-class\
  \ man/woman whose main source of information and opinion is the mass media, surely\
  \ associates it with Syria. Syrians are considered the refugees par excellence.\
  \ The most and the best refugees, and unfortunately for Western eyes, the only ones.\
  \ It would be interesting to carry out a survey among western citizens with the\
  \ highest IQ per inhabitant and ask their locals about the situation of the Burmese\
  \ people in the border between Myanmar and Thailand.\n\nMost of the Western citizens\
  \ remain ignorant of an HR-related phenomenon that is happening in the aforementioned\
  \ enclave. And so it happened to the author of the article. At least, until I visited\
  \ the border area. \n\nThe situation of Myanmar doesn\u2019t seem to reach the political\
  \ and social stability promised when it seemed to open up to the rest of the world\
  \ back in 2012. Internal ethnic and military conflicts are the daily routine for\
  \ the Burmese people who simply seek to improve their living conditions. When crossing\
  \ the border to the Mekong River country, the situation doesn\u2019t get better.\
  \ At that point of disconnection between abyss and utopia, there are diverse organizations\
  \ working for improvement. They are made up of individuals mostly local but also\
  \ international, which demonstrates that an awareness of the context is possible\
  \ even though it is not a mainstream topic for our media. However, after visiting\
  \ Mae Sot, the main changing force is undoubtedly the local people, the one that\
  \ emerges from within and thanks to its own experiences, tries to improve the individual\
  \ stories. I remember the testimony of Mr Aung Aung, chairman of the Arakan Workers\
  \ Organization. He smilingly explained that after having been through the same situation,\
  \ he constituted the organization to help the migrant workers and at the same time,\
  \ to build a \u201Cbridge of dialogue\u201D with those forces that oppress them.\
  \ Mr Aung Aung tries to be the key piece that turns a situation of subordination\
  \ into a negotiation of equal forces. \n\nThe struggle in the Thai-Burma border\
  \ doesn\u2019t necessarily have to be the direct outcome of a migratory flow; sometimes\
  \ political decisions based on monetary issues lead to challenging situations and\
  \ regarding this, the West knows very well what is being talked about. Land dispossession\
  \ is what some local peasants are suffering from the government. A fight between\
  \ David and Goliath. A woman, whose seemingly fragile appearance but with a vibrant\
  \ and convincing speech, explains to us that her only pretension is not to be deceived\
  \ by the government. Meanwhile, the government sells you the idea of a promising\
  \ trade channel with the West. An ambitious project but unreal and at the expense\
  \ of your citizens\u2019 human rights. \n\nHowever, Western historical memory is\
  \ selective, forgetful and politically oriented. It is important to listen to these\
  \ people just for a short time, not only to raise awareness of the conflict but\
  \ also to make the listener self-conscious of his/her place in the world by putting\
  \ the whole reality in perspective. It is important to know that a refugee camp\
  \ doesn\u2019t necessarily have to be surrounded by sand or that borders are unbreakable.\
  \ At the end of the day, Mae Sot is a story composed of smaller stories that need\
  \ to be told, but above all to be listened to, and in that,  the West has to play\
  \ a primordial and changing role."
