Text: "I couldn\u2019t breathe. It was unclear whether the hive of tourist congestion\
  \ led by elevated flag poles or the Roman humidity was responsible. Yet there was\
  \ no time to lament my temper, I was focused. Amidst the intermittent shoulders\
  \ of strangers, I had my own elevated target to chase and it would not evade my\
  \ sight. For the conga line that trailed behind of sisters and brothers relied on\
  \ me as the eldest. The back of my father\u2019s charcoal hair was the white rabbit\
  \ we followed. It was time for 'pranzo' and the pride was hungry.  \n \nAfter a\
  \ sharp left turn and a flurry of young feet, we substituted the ecstasy of a traveller\u2019\
  s highway for an eerie silence. There were now more stray cats than people. We had\
  \ finally found Rome\u2019s Jewish Quarter. My lungs filled.  \n \nA shadow enveloped\
  \ the area as we all began feeling much cooler. I couldn\u2019t decide whether to\
  \ attribute my goosebumps to the climate or setting, but the observation didn\u2019\
  t bother me.  My attention was consumed by the cobbled lanes that coiled around\
  \ tired walls and restaurants. The doors of long-forgotten homes had a story to\
  \ tell but I couldn\u2019t hear it. As we walked, the proximity of my family members\
  \ progressively expanded during the diversions afforded by our own sets of curiosity.\
  \ Suddenly my thoughts were interrupted by the herding efforts of my father - \u201C\
  Vieni qui!\u201D, he shouted. The man acted more Italian than he was.  \n \nMy father\
  \ drew open a beaded curtain as he watched his children enter before him. I was\
  \ last in, but we were best dressed. Our reward for the journey was immediately\
  \ obvious. Middle-aged women lined the kitchen in hair nets (their war helmets)\
  \ and displays of pasta lay scattered across tables, kept in the pots they were\
  \ cooked in for sharing. I wondered why not a whisper of the beautiful frenzy could\
  \ be heard from the streets. I felt lucky. There were no foreigners here.  \n \n\
  As we sat and went about guessing the Italian-written dishes, I peered above my\
  \ menu to discover that Dad had already begun saving us the trouble as he spoke\
  \ to the waitress in her native tongue. We all put down our laminated pages, but\
  \ none of my siblings abandoned it for the same reason. How had he known what to\
  \ order?  \n \nBefore I had the chance to ask as the waitress left, a feminine voice\
  \ rung throughout the restaurant. It was welcomed by the arms of my father and saddled\
  \ over his left shoulder, I noticed tears crawl down the round cheeks of her face.\
  \ She pulled up a chair at the head of the table and us boys stood instinctively\
  \ as we were taught. \u201CBravi!\u201D, the woman enthused. I looked at my brothers\u2019\
  \ expressions. We now felt the same thing. \n\n\u201CThis is Rosa\u201D, Dad said.\
  \ \u201CBuongiorno Rosa\u201D, we all reacted. The family looked to Rosa - it was\
  \ her turn. \n\n\u201CYour Mamma and Pap\xE0 are very special to me. Tommaso\u2026\
  \u201D, she said turning to me, \u201CI knew you when you were very little - a bambino!\u201D\
  . The girls giggled. She smiled and continued with an amended tone, \u201CSince\
  \ the war, my entire family struggled to live well. I came to Australia in search\
  \ of work and the chance to break a cycle, you know. I sent back money to Italy\
  \ and your parents are the reason I can now own a restaurant.\u201D My father stopped\
  \ her before she had the chance to return to tears, \u201CAnd what a belissima restaurant\
  \ it is - \u201D. \u201CBasta\u201D, she refuted with a smirk, \u201CI hate it here.\
  \ No Jews live here anymore.  I still see my grandparents\u2019 faces against these\
  \ streets. I can\u2019t leave them, though, and so I keep the restaurant for them.\
  \ But enough... mangia!\u201D, she sang. The food had already arrived. \n\nI don\u2019\
  t think any of us wanted food at that moment but we ate as Rosa flirted with the\
  \ youth of my sisters. I looked around at a table full of food and life. We were\
  \ walking a road less travelled; living a connection to a place through someone\
  \ else's relationship with it. There was more to learn, and we had the appetite."
