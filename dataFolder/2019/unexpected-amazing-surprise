Text: "Some months ago I was living in Ireland and travelling around Europe every\
  \ weekend. As my budget was short, I was taking the cheapest flights instead of\
  \ choosing where to go. Following this pattern, in one of my first weekends, I booked\
  \ Bristol, in the UK. However, I overslept and missed my flight. I was very upset\
  \ and everybody was telling me that I hadn't missed anything as there is absolutely\
  \ nothing to be done in Bristol. Me, on the other hand, wanted to check it by myself.\
  \ Then, I booked another flight for the following weekend and eventually headed\
  \ to Bristol. As soon as I arrived, I could see I was right to insist on this trip.\
  \ People were very friendly, explained me how to get to the hostel, where to eat,\
  \ what to do and everything else. The city is small enough to wander around but\
  \ not quite small to make tourists bored. No need for public transportation or taxi,\
  \ which I particularly love as I can take pictures, talk to the locals and stop\
  \ wherever I want. Some of the attractions that are worth to visit are: the church\
  \ St Mary Redcliffe, Bristol Bridge and the surronding areas, Castle Park and its\
  \ Bristol Castle, St Nicholas Market, College Green where is also located the beautiful\
  \ Bristol Cathedral and the City Hall. Then, a little upper, we can see the University\
  \ of Bristol, the Bristol Museum & Art Gallery (which is free), the Brandon Hill\
  \ and its Cabot Tower from where we can take a great look from the top of the city.\
  \ To top it off, the most famous attraction of the city: the Clifton Suspension\
  \ Bridge and Clifton Observatory. There is a free guided tour that is very worth.\
  \ The guides do know about the history of the bridge and the city. Then I went to\
  \ Bristol Harbour, Millenium Square, Pero's Bridge and stayed in this harbouurside\
  \ area to rest and finally eat. There are lots of bars and restaurants, one beside\
  \ the other, just in front of the water what makes the view very pleasant. I decided\
  \ to stay in Za Za Bazaar with life music on the first floor and a fixed price buffet\
  \ dining restaurant with worldwide food on the second. The place is huge! And as\
  \ usual, I started talking to the locals and one of them told me to go to Bath,\
  \ UK, on the following day as I had walked around Bristol and had seen the main\
  \ attractions in just one day. Thus, on the following morning I took a bus and headed\
  \ to Bath. It was cheap and fast (around 20km) and this city was as nice as Bristol.\
  \  It is famous for its Thermal Spas but as they are pricy I just walked around\
  \ like I did in Bristol. The city is small and full of history. Everywhere we go,\
  \ there is something to be learnt. The Roman Baths are incredible as well as Bath\
  \ Abbey, the Parade Gardens, the Pulteney Bridge, the Holburne Museum, Sydney Gardens,\
  \ The Circus, Royal Crescent, Royal Victoria Park and Bath Botanical Garden. One\
  \ day was enough to see all of that, stop in a local restaurant to eat and drink\
  \ and take my bus back to Bristol to sleep for the last night. Summarizing, I spent\
  \ one day in Bristol, where people told me not to go, and one day in Bath, where\
  \ I had never heard about before. I just loved both cities with all my heart! I\
  \ really recommend everybody to go as there are activities for all ages and genders!\
  \ It was a pleasant weekend that nearly didn't happen because of my sleep but it\
  \ was all worth in the end, even paying twice for the flight and the hostel. Surprises\
  \ like that are always great to make us travel more, visit new places, meet new\
  \ people and learn new cultures. Life is short so I will keep seizing the day and\
  \ I hope you all do the same! Best regards, LORENA SANTA CEC\xCDLIA."
