Text: "The plane banks right to make its final approach for landing. I peek out of\
  \ the window and see a number of small squat airport maintenance buildings along\
  \ the runway. Sunlight is bouncing off their stained metal sheet roofs, kept restrained\
  \ from taking flight by heavy chunks of rock. So much like human aspirations. Further\
  \ away is a slowly meandering river, dotted with barges carrying ores from the quarries.\
  \ Goa has changed little in two decades, nor have I. \n\nTouch down, a short rumble,\
  \ an extended roll and I have arrived. The flight is full of lively young girls\
  \ who boarded with me at Moscow, keen to take a break from the winter back home\
  \ to enjoy the bright sun, soothing sand, lulling sea and vibrant chaos that is\
  \ Goa. It reminds me of happiness.\n\nThe sweat beginning to escape my skin, I amble\
  \ towards the arrival lounge with fellow travellers. After the relative quietness\
  \ of the flight cabin, the background has suddenly become alive with an audible\
  \ babble of giggles, exclamations and shouts. There are friendly looking security\
  \ people along the way, some of whom give me a kind nod and gentle smile of welcome.\
  \ Immigration done in a jiffy, I am out of the terminal looking at a large horde\
  \ of people, some holding up placards of diverse origins. I see what appears to\
  \ be my name scrawled on a piece of packaging cardboard. Attached to it is a mobile\
  \ phone toting Suresh who flashes an uplifting smile brimming with unconditional\
  \ hospitality. Introductions made, he relieves me of my luggage and warmly guides\
  \ me to his prized possesion, an old minivan that appears to be a veteran of innumerable\
  \ adventures. If only it could talk. Before getting in, I turn around for a final\
  \ glance at the airport and see a number of widely gesticulating, placard holding\
  \ people being exitedly swamped by the girls from Moscow. The air is shimmering\
  \ with prospects of fun, touts are doling out imaginary offers of breathtaking ingenuity\
  \ to smiling adults, children are straining to run wild, cattle are idling in the\
  \ middle of the road, horns are honking, shouts are booming, dust clouds are rising\
  \ and amongst it all, social boundaries are breaking down. Life has begun to thaw.\
  \ I have exited into paradise."
