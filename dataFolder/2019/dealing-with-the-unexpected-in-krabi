Text: "It's 7 o'clock and the morning sounds loud and busy in Krabi's airport. There's\
  \ a rhythm playing, almost like a song being repeated over and over again: \"Taxi,\
  \ Taxi, Taxi!\"\nA woman, not taller than my shoulder height approaches different\
  \ groups of tourists, including us:\n\"Need taxi? Where you going?\"\nTudor and\
  \ I take out the Airbnb printed reservation, and begin reading: \"Ao Nam Mao\"\n\
  \"Chai, Ao Nam Mao, 350 baht, ka\"\nA few more people come our way, asking us the\
  \ same thing, so we started feeling overwhelmed by the situation. \n\"Taxi, you\
  \ want taxi?\"\n\nMy ears are racing so we leave the chanting and the noises behind\
  \ us. I take a deep breath to calm down and feel the hot air going in my lungs,\
  \ warming me up. We're walking through the parking lot, but we stop when Tudor sees\
  \ a Taxi sign, with one cab beneath it. The driver is standing, hands on the car\
  \ roof, smiling and looking at us. He asks \"Where you go, kap?\"\nWe took out the\
  \ printed booking again and gave it to him.\n\"Chai, Ao Nam Mao. 500 baht\"\nI muster\
  \ up some courage to ask \"350?\", but the driver laughed and said no. I look at\
  \ Tudor, we nod at each other and go along with it. Even if we're silent about it,\
  \ we feel somewhat cheated.\n\nThe car moves almost gleefully, passing through different\
  \ sceneries: fields of rubber trees, palm trees and a small town that looks pretty\
  \ run-down. On our way to the resort, the driver asks:\n\"Private beach, yes?\"\n\
  Well, that's what I expect, so I answer \"Yes, private beach.\"\nHe smiles, and\
  \ drives along the scenery until we reach a pier. We're supposed to get to a 'local'\
  \ resort with bamboo huts and a private beach, not a pier. I take out the reservation\
  \ again. Tudor is trying to explain the address is wrong, although we're not sure\
  \ where we're supposed to be anyway. He shows the driver the address one more time:\n\
  \"Ao Nam Mao\" says Tudor\n\"Yes: Ao Nam Mao.... pier!\" replies the driver while\
  \ smiling\n\"No, no, no. No pier: Ao Nam Mao!\"\n\"Ao Nam Mao, pier!\"\n\nWe have\
  \ no access to the internet because our tourist SIM cards are in the bag; before\
  \ I get the chance to activate it card, Tudor has roaming active on his phone with\
  \ GoogleMaps open. The map loads our location, and then... it goes above the admitted\
  \ limit for extra-charges. 50$. Luckily, he realises we are 15 minutes away from\
  \ our destination. I get off, pay the driver and walk away from the car. The driver\
  \ smiles as he's waving at us. We didn't. \n\nIn a stark contrast to the temperature\
  \ inside the car, the sun outside is getting hotter; we're in the middle of a county\
  \ road with no sidewalk. I'm looking at the few houses across us: most of them have\
  \ palm leaf roofing. In front of one, a kid, about 4 years old, completely naked\
  \ is playing with an old car tire. He looks at us baffled. The sun is warming up\
  \ the top of my head, the humid air is hard to breathe and I'm sweaty and tired.\
  \ After walking through car noises, a few honks and some of weird looks, we make\
  \ it!\n\nTudor is the first one disappointed. The beach doesn't look 'swimmable'\
  \ at all and the reception is weird and deserted. Unfortunately, we're so tired\
  \ that we just need a bed and pillow to rest our heads. Feeling disappointment for\
  \ all of this, we give up, in favour of sleep.\n\nWe get some shut-eye, only to\
  \ wake up in a different place altogether. The tide had come, and it 'flooded' the\
  \ beach with warm, beautiful water. I feel the delicate sand beneath my feet. We\
  \ get to the reception area, grab some pamphlets and check out a list of pricing.\
  \ Tudor discovers that a taxi ride costs 600 baht, not 500 like we payed. \n\nHe\
  \ looks at me, and in that moment we realised, it's not the world around us that's\
  \ treating us unfairly; it's because of our judgment of the world that we treat\
  \ it unfairly."
