Text: "My trip to Hampi in June of 2018 was rather a random exploration and venturing\
  \ into unknown without any planning. Now, How to reach this place? How far is this\
  \ place from airport and major cities? I am sure we can google it.\nBut in this\
  \ article we talk about the two sides of Hampi and where you should be going in\
  \ search of your adventure. Primarily known to everyone Hampi is divided by a river.\
  \ On one side if this river is the spiritual side with temples and places for worship.\
  \ The other side is rather untouched by most of holy world and is mostly the raw\
  \ village side. Tho even this side is now developing into small cities, we still\
  \ get to notice the raw villages outside the small cities.\nBut according to my\
  \ understanding of this place called Hampi, it\u2019s actually divided into commercial\
  \ side and the real side. The commercial side has all the 5 star 3 star hotels and\
  \ much westernised cafes. This surely gives the place a commercial tourist destination\
  \ feel, you can stay at one of the luxury hotels and fire a car to take you around\
  \ the place and look at the amazing endless views of rocky mountains. These all\
  \ things I mentioned are too touristy and I am not here to suggest you that.\n\\\
  \nThe non-commercial side of Hampi is where you go if you want to experience the\
  \ real life of people living here. Most of the guest houses and traveller hostels\
  \ on this side of Hampi are made up of basic construction resources and also with\
  \ wood and leaves. You live in close proximity to the Rocky Mountains and wake up\
  \ to the beautiful feeling of being so close to them. Most of these guest house\
  \ and hostels are run by locals from village (locals are very polite and speak English\
  \ well) and you get to experience the culture and way of life these people live.\
  \ The cafes you see on this side of Hampi are more like shacks and are run by locals\
  \ and people who have come down to this place in search of peace and meaning of\
  \ life, got so well involved in local life that you won\u2019t be able to differentiate\
  \ them from people of village. Such is the story of one very small caf\xE9 in this\
  \ local side of Hampi called \u2018Benjamin Music caf\xE9\u2019.\nYou should be\
  \ lucky enough to catch this caf\xE9 open and its one amazing experience if you\
  \ meet Benjamin himself. The caf\xE9 is run by Benjamin and his wife. Benjamin according\
  \ to my information is from Israel and his wife in Indian from south. Benjamin music\
  \ caf\xE9 is small but made with a lot of passion towards music. You will see a\
  \ number of guitars hanging on the wall, and all kind of instruments collected by\
  \ travelling across placed all around the caf\xE9. Aunty makes amazing mango juice!\n\
  I cannot play guitar very well tho but, yes I know to strum a few chords well. I\
  \ took one of the guitars from the wall and started playing drifting in my own zone.\
  \ Yes! Hampi does that to you, You very easily drift into your zone and its very\
  \ peaceful. An old man, thin in figure, darkish complexion and has a very bright\
  \ face was looking at me playing guitar adjusting his specs.  He came down and sat\
  \ with us. He did not need any introduction, He was Benjamin. He liked whatever\
  \ I was playing and started conversation with us. Benjamin has travelled the world\
  \ in his age when he had a band. Benjamin took guitar from me and said, \u2018I\
  \ have not played guitar for a long time, but I will play one song for you!\u2019\
  \nAnd he sand which I would call one of the most amazing live performance I have\
  \ ever witnessed. Benjamin sang a Karnataki song!"
