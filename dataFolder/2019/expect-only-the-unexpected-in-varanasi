Text: "I traveled for 29 hours straight to cover a distance of just over 500 miles,\
  \ switching my mode of transport almost a dozen times, and reached the beautiful\
  \ city of Varanasi. It felt almost as if I crawled into this place but that\u2019\
  s what makes impromptu plans all the way more exciting, right? Now, on to the article.\n\
  \nBest way to reach Varanasi is it\u2019s beautiful Banaras Railway Station. There\
  \ are a lot of commonalities between the two acclaimed oldest cities of the world\
  \ - Jerusalem and Varanasi. The streets are narrow, bustling with vendors, highly\
  \ religious and most importantly - trapped in time. Also, like Jerusalem, it has\
  \ two popular old names - Kashi and Benaras; both of them are quite frequent in\
  \ daily jargons even today. Other than the oldest-city-claim, every Banarsi (a person\
  \ belonging to Benaras) takes pride in two things - the Kashi Vishwanath Temple\
  \ and the local food. \n\nI woke up at 4 am to visit the famous Kashi Vishwanath\
  \ temple. Unexpectedly, the temple complex was scantily crowded. Even at this hour,\
  \ given that I visited on Monday morning, it should have been full of devotees.\
  \ Monday is auspicious to the deity of this Temple - Lord Shiva. The sages and devotees\
  \ usually take a holy dip in the Ganges first and then visit this temple which is\
  \ just a one minute walk. The nearby area is full of small eateries, fancy cafes\
  \ and fine dine restaurants. You can rest assured of the taste anywhere, I would\
  \ suggest having a quick go through of Google recommendations. \n\nMust-have-food\
  \ includes 1. Streetside Chaat food: Although this could be a spice bomb for people\
  \ not used to of Indian Cuisine, it\u2019s definitely worth a try once in the trip.\n\
  2. Sweets: Varanasi loves it\u2019s sweet A LOT. Your meal can\u2019t skip a dessert,\
  \ simply enter any sweets\u2019 shop and savor the lip-smacking delicacies.\n3.\
  \ Banarasi Pan: The betel nut leaf or simply Paan, has altogether a dedicated shop\
  \ at every nook and corner of any Indian city. But Paan in Varanasi is hands down\
  \ the best. Honestly, it can\u2019t be described in words, you need to experience\
  \ it yourself.\n\nI stayed at the hostel of BHU or the Benaras Hindu University\
  \ campus. BHU is a 100-year-old University and its campus has a totally different\
  \ vibe. If the city is a circus of cacophony, BHU campus is the abode of silence.\
  \ One can\u2019t miss the Vishwanath Temple (also called VT) inside this campus\
  \ while visiting Varanasi. It is similar to the famous Kashi Vishwanath Temple but\
  \ feels more organized and settled. Pro-tip: The campus food is good, especially\
  \ for tourists having high hygiene concerns, this is quite a pocket-friendly option\
  \ over the street food in the city. \n\nDuring the evening, head to Ganges\u2019\
  \ Riverside - Dashashwamedh Ghat. Tourist flock here for witnessing the Ganga Aarti,\
  \ a ceremonial ritual to offer prayer to River Ganges. The city has a lot of piers\
  \ or as they\u2019re called locally - Ghats. One of the other famous ghats is the\
  \ Manikarnika Ghat, this is where the Hindus perform last rites of their loved ones\
  \ who pass away. It is a Hindu tradition to cremate the body after death. It is\
  \ considered as highly fortunate to get a cremation here, the \u2018eternal flame\u2019\
  \ pot is said to never have stopped since 5000 years. \n\nThere are many other tourist\
  \ attractions in the city. A lot of tourists come for Yoga and Meditation. If you\
  \ have the bandwidth, do visit Sarnath. Sarnath is a small town just 30 minutes\
  \ away from Varanasi. It is also the birthplace of Buddhism. It is the place where\
  \ Gautama Buddha gave his first sermon. Sarnath is highly peaceful with historic\
  \ ruins all around the place. It has Chinese Temple, Tibetan Temple, Burmese Temple,\
  \ Jain Temple and obviously Buddhist Temples; It truly feels like a cocktail of\
  \ Asian religions.\n\nWhile heading back, you can shop for Saree - the traditional\
  \ Indian women attire. The Banarsi Silk Saree is famous for its artistry work and\
  \ rich feel. You can also purchase Gulabi Minakari, this silverware artwork is only\
  \ done in Varanasi. If you feel smitten by spirituality, you can purchase small\
  \ idols of Gods and Goddesses as well."
