Text: "Title: You\u2019re Already Happy - You Just Don\u2019t Know It Yet\u201D.\n\
  \nCan one find happiness in a month of solitude in Bali?  Of course I can.  Or so\
  \ I thought.  For years now I\u2019ve known something was missing in my life.  The\
  \ spark and the fire that I used to feel most every single day was greatly diminished.\
  \  The edges of who I am were becoming dull and somewhat dim.  I was falling into\
  \ a routine with no meaning.  No purpose.  No context.\n\nHow did this happen? \
  \ I\u2019m relatively young.  Successful by Western standards.  In good health.\
  \  I have the most amazing son in the world whom without I\u2019m sure my plight\
  \ would be far more shackled.  And when exactly did this happen?  That I lost my\
  \ life compass.  That I began to be less than who I imagined I could be.  Was it\
  \ when I achieved all that I thought I wanted?  Was it the prospect of my \u201C\
  bucket list\u201D being empty?  \n\nI really don\u2019t know when and where it happened.\
  \  There are so many intersections in life it is hard to retrace the journey and\
  \ pinpoint a moment in time.  In fact my condition is likely the sum of many inumerable\
  \ moments in time.  Woven together into a fabric that clouds my thinking and my\
  \ view of the world and who I am.  Or more importantly why I am.\n\nMy feeble attempts\
  \ at self diagnosis are symptoms of the plain fact that I somehow lost the capacity\
  \ to be Happy.  Not to say there are lot times of joy. There certainly are. Sharing\
  \ a laugh with friends.  Spending time with my son.  And there are others.  But\
  \ the happiness I refer to is that feeling that is still there when you are all\
  \ alone.  No one in the room.  That happiness used to fill the room for me and be\
  \ my company, my warmth, my comforter.\n\nThe idea of going to Bali for a month\
  \ to try to restore myself was not something that just happened.  I believe my inner\
  \ psyche was reaching out and orchestrating the sequence of events that were required\
  \ to make this trip a possibility.  I truly believe the subconscious mind is vastly\
  \ more powerful than the conscious.\n\nSo here I am, nearing the end of my month\
  \ in Bali.  Visited four villages.  Consulted with a medicine man.  Visited temples\
  \ and natural places.  Practiced a little Yoga.  Tried while here to let go and\
  \ empty my mind and my thoughts.\n\nAs time passed by I could feel the ball start\
  \ to unwind.  But I knew that was the natural effect of what was really a vacation\
  \ in the books of most people.  However, I did begin to feel lighter.  And in doing\
  \ so began to relax more.  \n\nThe \u201Cmoment\u201D for me came just days before\
  \ my trip concluded.  It wasn\u2019t any one thing that triggered the awakening.\
  \  It wasn\u2019t any one person or moment.  Like the fabric woven over time to\
  \ shroud me in a veil of misunderstanding and doubt this process or lack thereof\
  \ revealed to me something quite profound.\n\nWhat happened was the peeling back\
  \ of that veil.  Little by little.  Each experience untwisting a little piece of\
  \ material.  Undoing yet another know. Creating small tears and openings.  Letting\
  \ slivers of light in.  And eventually wide swaths of life began to beam through.\
  \  Awakening my spirit, warming my heart, and reckoning with my mind.\n\nThe experience\
  \ felt sudden.  But in fact I\u2019ve realized that it started long before this\
  \ trip.  It starts with recognition.   It continues with understanding.  And it\
  \ concludes with taking action.\n\nFinding compassion for yourself is not easy.\
  \  We are taught to be outward beings.  Seeking happiness in the external.  What\
  \ we forget sometimes is that the happiness that is all around us radiates from\
  \ within us.  To find your applies you begin the journey inside yourself.  Only\
  \ there will you find your true self and the unbridled and endless happiness and\
  \ joy that can sustain you and those around you in ways you never imagined.\n\n\
