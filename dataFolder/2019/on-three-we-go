Text: "I booked it a few days before, whilst on the Greyhound bus. Passing through\
  \ stunning Australian countryside, field upon field and wide expansive land. My\
  \ bus journey was a long one, starting in Brisbane and working my way up to Airlie\
  \ Beach; I was on the classic solo backpacker trail on the East Coast. \n\nValentine\u2019\
  s morning 6am. I was excited and nervous reading my confirmation email. Two feelings\
  \ which would continue throughout my time sailing in the Whitsundays for the two\
  \ days prior. Then, landing back on solid ground it was time to have a quiet night\
  \ and prepare for what awaited me the following morning.\n\nI woke up at 5am, but\
  \ in all honesty I didn\u2019t really sleep. Making my way across to the store front,\
  \ I checked in, was weighed and tried to stomach a cereal bar. I chatted nervously\
  \ with a few others on the way to the airport, then it was time to get paired up,\
  \ kitted up and onto the plane.\n\nThe last one in, is the first one out.\n\nI remembered\
  \ that from someone I\u2019d met along the way in Cairns and that stuck with me.\
  \ Despite giving off the enthusiastic, extrovert exterior, I was basically terrified\
  \ and really starting to wonder why: 1. I had got out of bed at such an early hour.\
  \ 2. Hadn\u2019t told my parents I was about to do this (sorry) and 3. Was it safe?\
  \ Really though?! \n\nI didn\u2019t have much time to work through all my thoughts\
  \ and emotions as I was bundled onto the plane and we approached take off. I tell\
  \ you, taking off in a plane with the door open is some experience. It\u2019s amazing\
  \ to see the earth so clearly beneath you but you soon get this innate feeling that\
  \ something isn\u2019t right. It was an incredibly clear morning and Northern Queensland\
  \ looked beautiful beneath us as we circled higher in the sky.\n\nWe approached\
  \ 15,000 feet in a matter of minutes and I sat there with sweaty palms, dizzying\
  \ over the view below me as the door was pulled open. This was it. The sound was\
  \ deafening. The wind battered across the side of the plane as the pilot steadied\
  \ us and my tandem diver shuffled me towards the door.\n\n\u201COn three, we go.\u201D\
  \ He told me.\n\nOne.\n\nTwo.\n\nAnd then time stood still and rushed by all at\
  \ once.\n\nA feeling I can\u2019t explain. The freefall.\n\nA rush of euphoria and\
  \ a realisation that this was the closest I\u2019d ever get to flying. I wondered,\
  \ zooming through the air at speeds up to 120km/hour if I was to do this again,\
  \ would it feel the same?\n\nThe Whitsundays glistened beneath me in the early sunrise.\
  \ It was after all, 6:30am by this point. I rushed through the sky, bustling against\
  \ the wind and trying to take in every second.\n\nMy tandem skydiver pulled the\
  \ parachute and we slowed down, gliding through the air effortlessly. I felt a sense\
  \ of calm. Serene. Gazing at the view across the sea and the runway slowly getting\
  \ closer below.\n\nBefore long we were circling around to prepare for landing. Raising\
  \ my knees into my chest, my tandem braced for the ground. We landed.\n\nThe whole\
  \ experience seemed to rush by but to this day I still remember the topsy turvy\
  \ feeling in my stomach as we left the plane and let gravity take control. \n\n\
  Would I do it again?\n\nI\u2019d like to think so\u2026"
