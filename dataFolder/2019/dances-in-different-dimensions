Text: "I was among those who had been summoned to the middle of nowhere; thirty thousand\
  \ strangers, united there to witness one of nature\u2019s most astounding performances.\
  \ Not since February 1979 had a total solar eclipse been visible from North America.\
  \ \n\nThirty-eight years later, on an almost unbearably perfect late August morning,\
  \ we gathered in the high desert, the heart of Oregon beating so hard that the ground\
  \ radiated love. Waves of elevated consciousness rippled over the entire globe that\
  \ day.\n\nI had woken up different, accrediting lunar energy for this stirring of\
  \ my inner landscape. I blamed it on the cosmos, using the following reasoning:\
  \ the moon\u2019s gravitational pull is responsible for the vehemence of oceans\
  \ so vast, they constitute most of our planet. If a slight change in her position\
  \ can alter tides, it would be wild not to believe in her influence upon me. After\
  \ all, I too, am a body composed mostly of water.\n\nA man in search of meaning\
  \ had travelled from the 49th state, leaving Northern skies behind him void of their\
  \ signature colours\u2014stealing them in his eyes. He arrived in the middle of\
  \ the night, rattling not only the earth but parallel dimensions with every step.\
  \ The moon glanced over, jealous, for in his presence, she would seem far less spectacular.\n\
  \ \nWe congregated by the lake, readying ourselves to witness this phenomenon that\
  \ had beguiled mankind since the beginning of time. Indigenous tribes ceremoniously\
  \ welcomed the event with tear-inducing, reverent songs, imbuing the atmosphere\
  \ with an ethereal quality. The excitement, the fervent energy of thousands of light\
  \ beings culminated, eager to be released. It got so strong that I thought I might\
  \ pass out. I didn\u2019t. No fairy tale author had ever successfully imagined or\
  \ written about the way we all felt in that moment.\n\nFinally, the moon\u2014whom\
  \ I had since forever revered as the fairest of celestial bodies, made her entrance.\
  \ She crept over the sun in a paradoxical way that only she had ever mastered. Rapidly\
  \ slow. Gracefully dramatic. Humbly resplendent. A quintessential representation\
  \ of the divine feminine, the bell of a ball to which she was rarely invited. She\
  \ and the sun embraced for an eternal moment; star-crossed lovers, re-living the\
  \ magic of every kiss they had ever exchanged.\n\nA pin dropping might have disrupted\
  \ the silence that had fallen upon the previously fervid spectators. Knees fell\
  \ to the ground. Tears streamed down sun-kissed cheeks. Lovers and friends found\
  \ each-other\u2019s arms. Poetry was recited. Art was created. Babies were made.\
  \ And then came the howls. Humans howl at the moon too, and my god, it\u2019s beautiful\
  \ when they do.  \n\nI peeled my gaze away for a second, to process the unfathomable\
  \ beauty of the sky above. I couldn\u2019t escape it. Amidst totality, in the subtle\
  \ glow of nothingness, in the juxtaposition of two typically mutually-exclusive\
  \ worlds, I saw him. The Northern man\u2014 a time traveller, an inter-galactic\
  \ being, an alien, perhaps; stardust in his hair, electricity in his heart, bass\
  \ coursing through his veins.\n\nThere, in mid-day darkness, I watched my soul\u2019\
  s counterpart staring back at me through eyes the same colour as my own. I put my\
  \ lighter up to his face, to see him better; most people back away from fire but\
  \ him, well, he leaned right in. \n\nI understood that the difference within me\
  \ that morning had less to do with the moon and everything to do with this convergence\
  \ of souls. There had indeed been a shift in celestial alignment; stars colliding\
  \ after millennia on their trajectory toward one another.\n\nWe had come for the\
  \ moon; to watch her dancing unencumbered in this forbidden realm. Without even\
  \ knowing, we found ourselves dancing too\u2014and like the astral bodies above\
  \ us, in this impossible space between two dimensions, is the only place we could\
  \ ever exist.\n\nPatagonia, Chile. December 2020. The time and place of the next\
  \ Northern-Hemisphere celestial slow dance. Perhaps, a being from where the sun\
  \ rarely goes, and a woman who loves the dark will cross paths again there too."
