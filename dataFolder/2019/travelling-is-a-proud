Text: "First city on the timeline of my travel history is Bikaner, in Rajasthan. Year\
  \ was 2014 and I was travelling with my sister. While she has to attend conference\
  \ in Veterinary University there, I was free to travel around. On the first day,\
  \ when I was walking down the street, I heard, \u201CSardar Ji, Kya pagri bandh\
  \ te ho yaar\u201D, a man was praising the style of my turban. I appreciated his\
  \ thought and kept walking. Later that day after having lunch, I met the gate keeper\
  \ of the university. \u201CSardar Ji, tum yaar khate Kya ho, itne hatte katte aur,\
  \ kya pagri bandh te ho yaar\u201D, said the gate keeper. I lingered to know his\
  \ views about my turban. He said, \u201CStyle of your turban is beautiful, just\
  \ like a king\u201D. That was a great feeling, maybe because I was listening that\
  \ for the first time. In my 3-day tour to Bikaner, I noticed that people have great\
  \ respect for Sikhs. Whenever I was interacting with people, they were referring\
  \ me with the word \u201CSardar Ji\u201D. Word \u2018Sardar\u2019 means the head\
  \ of community or a family, but in India people mostly use this word to refer to\
  \ a Sikh and \u2018Ji\u2019 is a word used to show respect.\nI am not a hardcore\
  \ follower of Sikhism, but from that experience I have learned that besides the\
  \ love and respect for Sikhs and being a Sikh, I am always welcomed almost everywhere\
  \ in the country.\nFirst time when I was in Delhi, I forgot to make my hotel reservation\
  \ and searching a hotel in Delhi was completely exhausting. Then, I went to Gurudwara\
  \ Bangla Sahib, a Sikh Temple near Connaught Place in New Delhi. It was amazing\
  \ to see the grandeur of that place, just like Sikh Temples in Punjab, that place\
  \ was also holding the goodwill for the devotees regardless of their cast or race.\
  \ There I got chance to meet plenty of people from different parts of India and\
  \ even from abroad. That was the place where I got the chance to see rich and poor\
  \ persons sitting in the same rows for their meals. \nPeople\u2019s affection towards\
  \ Sikhs is never ending in India. During brunch at a tea stall besides a Truck Union\
  \ in Ahmedabad, a city in Gujarat, ice breaker between me and the owner turned out\
  \ to be the story of his son. He said, \u201CIn year 1997, My son left home to join\
  \ Indian Army after watching Bollywood movie Border, based on a heroic defense of\
  \ Longewala post against Pakistani troops\u201D. He also said that his son left\
  \ without informing his family. He said, \u201CI tried my best to find my son, but\
  \ everything went in vain. When I lost hope then after two years, unexpectedly he\
  \ was found in Punjab and was brought back home by a Sikh Army Officer\u201D. I\
  \ was completely stunned after listening to his story. Due to his affection towards\
  \ Sikhs, he helped me as traveler by giving me more knowledge about the city and\
  \ arranged my stay in the city.\nIn year 2017, I was in Mumbai for Canon Photomarathon.\
  \ After that I visited Elephanta Caves, an island near Mumbai. When I entered, two\
  \ ladies asked me if they can have a photograph with me. They were from Spain, and\
  \ they were huge admirer of Sikhism as they had learned the Spanish translated holy\
  \ book of Sikhism Guru Granth Sahib. Apart from that, it is true that there are\
  \ many theories proved by scientists are already written in the book. \nSikh is\
  \ word of Punjabi language, which means \u2018To Learn\u2019 and a Sikh is recognized\
  \ from his Turban. In old times, Turban was considered a symbol of responsibility.\
  \ In every Sikh family, every male member was used to wear Turban. Except that,\
  \ Patriarch of families of religions other than Sikhism, were used to wear Turban.\
  \ Trend of Turban is not just limited to Punjab. In other states like Rajasthan,\
  \ people wear Turbans except the style is different."
