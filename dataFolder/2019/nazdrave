Text: "\u201CI am a Father!\u201D the Russian yelled to the near empty train, a bottle\
  \ of whiskey swinging in his right hand.  It was New Year\u2019s Eve.  The man had\
  \ been celebrating this news in silence for a few hours from the start of our overnight\
  \ train.  It seemed like now was the time to share. About an hour from midnight,\
  \ Ivan stumbles forward while reveling in my new experiences.  All of this: the\
  \ first time on an overnight train, first time in Europe and now, first time hearing\
  \ the news of someone having a baby.  I cheered along with the train.\n\nThe two\
  \ Bulgarian chess champions and their father, Valeri, sitting in front of us, pulled\
  \ various sausages, cheeses, and a family made bottle of the strongest liquor I\
  \ have ever tasted out of their canvas bags.  These foods were for celebrating the\
  \ New Year, but we must celebrate a new birth first.  They passed it around generously.\
  \  We smile, thanked them, all raising our glass to the new father.\n\n\u201CNazdr\xE1\
  ve!\u201D our Bulgarian friends cried.\n\nWith a hearty \u201CCongratulations!\u201D\
  \ from my brother that was all that was needed bring Ivan to us, momentarily forgetting\
  \ his son, and finding the all too apparent Americans. He stumbled forward and leaned\
  \ over my seat, demanding an American one dollar bill from Nate.  His shadowy form\
  \ engulfed the little bit of light still flickering from this train on New Years\
  \ Eve.  I shrank in my seat.  My brother next to me smiled benignly, at peace with\
  \ his seat choice; he only heard the question, I smelt it.  I quietly pulled out\
  \ a dollar from the money belt I kept secretly under my shirt, and nervously handed\
  \ it out to him.\n\n\u201CI will not steal it,\u201D he laughed as he took the dollar\
  \ and pointed out all the masonic symbols on it.  He described how these symbols\
  \ made their way into our currency; the eye of the providence, the pyramid: all\
  \ of these proof our country was built on deceit.  The \"new order of the ages\"\
  \ seemed appropriate as we trundled along toward Berlin.\n\nOnce he was satisfied\
  \ that we accepted the Illuminati was watching us, he swayed back down the aisle.\
  \  Pop, Flicker.  A new town was lit up in a swarm of colour. Flicker, boom, flicker,\
  \ bang.  We could hear the \u201Cohs and ahs\u201D with each passing firework. \
  \ Our train car illuminated by the fireworks of hundreds of towns, the celebrations\
  \ starting off with something new.   We had our own personal celebrations in our\
  \ train car.  To one, a new life, a new baby.  To another, a new achievement and\
  \ to me, a new adventure. The yellows and reds sprayed across the inside of the\
  \ carriage.   Soon an earnest chat with gesturing, food exchange and laughter was\
  \ underway again.  \n\nA sound broke us from our revelry.  Ivan had retched, his\
  \ body leaning over one of the empty seats toward the front of the car.  The air\
  \ began fill.  \n\nThe father of the Bulgarian chess players looked to us apologetically.\
  \  He handed his half-drank glass of whiskey to his son and lifted up his tray.\
  \  As he walked toward the Russian, he turned to us and spoke quietly.  \u201CWe\u2019\
  re sisters,\u201D he halted, \u201CSister countries.  We help each other.  I help\
  \ him.\u201D  Ivan, still head in arm, leaned over using the chairs for support.\
  \  \n\nI went to open the window.  The fireworks started to peter out, the bangs\
  \ getting quieter with each mile.  And the window remained shut.  Ivan was coerced\
  \ into a seat closer to the front of the carriage, now, happily passed out reveling\
  \ in the new.  Valeri went back to the seats and began to clean up.  My brother\
  \ had already gone to find a train porter.  I looked around me, still feeling slightly\
  \ nauseous, I smiled.  This was one hell of a way to start the year.  With a new\
  \ father's last hoorah, let's hope we carry the sentiment not the smell."
