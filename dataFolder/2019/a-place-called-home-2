Text: "One year ago, I went to turkey for a new experience after my graduation, when\
  \ I was studying in university, for more than 5 years, I couldn't really enjoy traveling\
  \ before, I had an over protective parent, and they couldn't let me go anywhere,\
  \ so I decided to take the first opportunity and to travel and work in the same\
  \ time, and the destination was TURKEY. \nFor almost 14 months, I experienced waking\
  \ up every day somewhere you didn't expect that you can arrive to. But my experience\
  \ was when I was in SESME with the refugees, knowing that they lost everything they\
  \ had, and they are fighting to live.\n\xC7e\u015Fme is a coastal city in turkey,\
  \ colorful, happy and very joyful since I like the sea, I was sending the most wonderful\
  \ time. In \xC7e\u015Fme, 100 km west of Izmir on the Aegean coast, just six miles\
  \ from the Greek island of Chios, In other hand, I was looking for a memorable experience,\
  \ that s how I knew the refugees camp when my friend in the beach to l me about\
  \ it, telling me that life has more sense when we are home, and when our family\
  \ is next to us, He suggested to go for a look, being there was like if I was the\
  \ other side of \xC7e\u015Fme, the side where everything was colorful with black\
  \ and white, happy with all the smiles of little kids, hopeful with families waiting\
  \ for the reunion again. \nMigrants in Turkey are increasingly choosing to stay\
  \ there., and once a hotspot for migrants destined for the EU, there are no migrants\
  \ to be seen. The local police say that they have received orders to escort migrants\
  \ to Izmir. The coast guards, traumatized by months of perilous sea rescues and\
  \ of recovering bodies of migrants who did not make it to the shore, say that they\
  \ have not been called for the past few weeks.\nSome Turks complain that Syrians,\
  \ who accept to work for a third of normal salaries, are making life harder for\
  \ them. There were even protests in Dikili over plans to build a refugee camp there.\
  \ However, generally speaking, Turkish citizens have shown understanding and solidarity\
  \ towards the refugees.\nOn the night of Lailat al-Mi\u2019raj (the Muslim Ascension\
  \ night) we meet three Syrian refugees. They walk around \xC7e\u015Fme with some\
  \ Kurdish colleagues and share sweets as is the tradition on Lailat night. Like\
  \ Muhammad, they have decided to stay in Turkey. They work as labourers in a brick\
  \ factory and say it is easier for them to settle down here: \u201CUnlike in Europe\
  \ we are free to follow our religion here, our wives can wear the hijab and we feel\
  \ comfortable socialising with Kurds,\u201D they say.\nWell, Turkey for some is\
  \ being home, for others is the door to UE, for me was the leap to faith, I knew\
  \ after that that home is where we belong, is where we feel ourselves, is where\
  \ our soul is free. HOME IS WHERE I BELONG. \nI my trip to turkey showed me and\
  \ taught me that we all still need to know and see many other places, and that the\
  \ universe is bigger and wilder to stay in one place."
