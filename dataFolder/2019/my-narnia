Text: "When the mist blows off the top and you look up feeling the sunshine warm and\
  \ the wind blow cold. These are the freeze in time moments where I know climbing\
  \ mountains and experiencing remote and untouched natural beauty is what gets my\
  \ heart beating. Beating loud over deafening winds and deathly silent and tranquil\
  \ lakes. \n\nThe Mourne Mountains in Northern Ireland is one of these places that\
  \ I travel for all the excitement of an adventurous challenge and the walking reverie\
  \ of vast mountains and lakes. An absolute reset button.\n\n\nLast time I visited\
  \ solo, I was at the base for sunrise. Smiling from ear to ear on an adventure like\
  \ Bilboa Baggins tearing off. I was bursting with sheer joy watching the November\
  \ sky ablaze as a roaring ball of fire peered over the mountain. \n\nWith six major\
  \ peaks of Granite rock the Mourne Mountains are a paradise or hillwalkers, mountain\
  \ climbers and those with an adventurous spirit. The sheer size of the towering\
  \ blue colored Mountains forces you to take a step back and acknowledge the mastery\
  \ of nature. Spending a moment thinking how long they\u2019ve been here, I concluded\
  \ it was too big to comprehend and thought \u2018they\u2019ve been here long before\
  \ me and will be long after me\u2019. \n\nJust when you thought you\u2019ve reached\
  \ your quota of inspiration you\u2019ll come across the Mourne Wall. The power of\
  \ man and collaboration can not but be admired when you look along the length of\
  \ 35km the drystone wall that crosses fifteen summits constructed between 1904 and\
  \ 1922 when there wasn\u2019t anything like the level of machinery or technology\
  \ available today. As I was sweating running up the incline of Slieve Binnian my\
  \ exertion was dwarfed looking at the massive boulders these men had to move to\
  \ define the boundaries of the Belfast water commission. Spending a minute considering\
  \ their incredible feats of perseverance I continued on towards Slieve Donard leaving\
  \ the Mourne Wall behind me. \n\nSlieve Donard is the highest peak standing at 850\
  \ metres, modest compared to some other peaks in Europe, but none of these other\
  \ mountains moved me like Mourne did. Steeped in history it is as if all worldly\
  \ worries sweep away with the fog and off over the Irish Sea. I say hello to the\
  \ winding wall of Mourne again as it  runs up the western and southern slopes meeting\
  \ at the summit at a small stone tower. Researching the magical place I stumbled\
  \ on nuggets of irish mythology learning that here lies the are the remains of two\
  \ ancient burial cairns, one of which is the remains of the highest known passage\
  \ tomb or burial ground in Ireland. Donard got its name from Saint Donard  who made\
  \ the remote summit his hermitage Up until the 1830\u2019s Donard was one of Irelands\
  \ many pilgrimages where people would climb to the peak praying, much like Croke\
  \ Patrick in Irelands west county Mayo. \n\nAs I head for home looking out over\
  \ the Irish sea I keep having to stop and pause to take it all in. The cold wind\
  \ doesn\u2019t allow you to stop too long.\n\nIf Mythology and adventure doesn\u2019\
  t put a fire in your belly to get up Mourne this summer perhaps you\u2019ll be inspired\
  \ from the comfort of your sofa. \u2018Winter is coming \u2019 and the hugely popular\
  \ Game of Thrones Series uses some scenes from the Mourne Mountains as their back\
  \ drop. Northern Ireland has made major tourist attractions from some of the iconic\
  \ images and scences featured in the series. If it\u2019s the classics you\u2019\
  re into CS Lewis\u2019s \u2018The Lion the Witch and the Wardrobe\u2019 was inspired\
  \ by my beloved Mournes. He said 'I have seen landscapes, notably in the Mourne\
  \ Mountains and southwards which under a particular light made me feel that at any\
  \ moment a giant might raise his head over the next ridge,' \n\nI absolulety agree.\
  \ If you do brave the unknown and venture into Naria steeped in history, dramatic\
  \ landscapes, mythology and acres and acres of inspiration you will be rewarded\
  \ handsomely with a clearer mind and a very full heart.\n\nMourne you own part of\
  \ me."
