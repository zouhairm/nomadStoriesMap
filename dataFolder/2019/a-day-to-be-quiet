Text: "Twinkle twinkle, little star,\nHow I wonder what you are.\nUp above the world\
  \ so high,\nLike a diamond in the sky.\nTwinkle twinkle, little star,\nHow I wonder\
  \ what you are\n\n\nThe singing of two little girls with thick Balinese accent sounds\
  \ cute and funny at the same time. The siblings were about to listen to their father\u2019\
  s brief about Nyepi, the Hindu\u2019s New Year ritual, which will be held tomorrow.\n\
  \n\u201CNyepi means \u2018stay quiet\u2019, so tomorrow like every other year we\
  \ will pray all day at temple, while practicing 4 rules of Tapa Brata. You girls\
  \ remember all of them, right?\u201D asked Putu, my private guide to his two children.\n\
  \u201CAmati Karya means no working, Amati Geni means no light, fire or electricity.\
  \ Amati Lelanguan, no entertainment. Amati Lelungan means no going out.\u201D The\
  \ big sister answered so cleverly, it\u2019s as if the question was asked frequently.\
  \ Actually, I knew Putu only ask those kids this question just to indirectly warned\
  \ me about these rules. \n\nI made a deal with Putu before, that I\u2019ll stay\
  \ for on Nyepi day at his home, for simply I want to experience it.\nPutu lives\
  \ with his wife and children in a traditional Bali house. It has multiple pavilions\
  \ surrounded and separated by a tropical garden. They let me sleep on the guest\
  \ pavillion.  It\u2019s small but it had window. No AC but chill enough because\
  \ it got openings. Before I went to sleep, I turn off my smartphone so I won't violate\
  \ the rules of Amati Geni the next day.\n\nThe next morning, I get out from my room,\
  \ walking through the tropical garden, stepping on the stepping stone path.\nI look\
  \ around the house but as expected, there\u2019s no one since Putu and his family\
  \ left already to temple.\n\nI stepped to the middle pavilion, there I saw framed\
  \ pictures hanged on the wall, one of them I believed is the picture of Putu\u2019\
  s late father.\n\nI, too, have similar grayscale picture at my home at Jakarta,\
  \ just it's the picture of my late grandpa, and I couldn't stare at it.\nSilly,\
  \ but that's what I do. I just keep avoiding to see his picture.\nBecause every\
  \ time I see it, I remember, and it hurts. When he left, I wasn't ready to let go.\n\
  In the quiet time like this, my thoughts speak louder to me.\n\nI was bored so I\
  \ go out to the front gate to see outside. Just peeking a little, I thought.\nThe\
  \ street was so clear, there's nobody but Pecalang patrolying.\nPecalang are local\
  \ traditional police. They area easy to spot because of their costume :  traditional\
  \ headdresses called \u201CUdeng\u201D and chess-like patterned sarong. Their duty\
  \ is to make sure everyone in the neighborhood practice the Tapa Brata.\nI don't\
  \ want to violate the rules of Amati Lelungan, so I'd better go back inside.\n\n\
  This time, I sit at the gazebo. After some time, there were sounds of footsteps.\n\
  Putu and his family finally got home, I thought.\nTurns out it\u2019s the neighbor.\
  \ Funny how I was expecting them, for I always claimed myself as a loner introvert.\
  \ \nI\u2019m used to live alone, but I always got things to do. But now since the\
  \ time feels like it\u2019s going so slow, it\u2019s hard to get through the day.\n\
  \nThe quietness with tinkling sounds from the wind chime made me fall asleep.\n\
  When I wake up, it\u2019s night already. Looks like Putu and his family are home.\n\
  I stepped out from the gazebo, but then I stopped when I see the sky.\n\nBecause\
  \ all the light in Bali goes off today, the sky tonight is especially clear. \n\
  There are so many stars. I\u2019ve never seen such a lot of stars.\nWhen I look\
  \ at it, the sky looks kind off round and the stars were so varied.\nThe big, the\
  \ small, the bright ones, the not-so bright ones, and the one which strangely keep\
  \ twinkling. \nThat time, I feel very small.\nTurns out there are these many stars\
  \ above me every night, I just can\u2019t see them because of the city light."
