Text: "Spring air in Spain has a cold edge. The smell of fresh grass, fried seafood\
  \ and tobacco drift in a lingering winter breeze. But with sunshine and grins from\
  \ locals, the cool chill is sugar coated because you are in the rough-diamond that\
  \ is Espa\xF1a. \n\nMy senses switched on when I arrived in Spain. The motorways\
  \ that stretched from the hub of Madrid, to the small metropolises. But the stillness\
  \ of Spanish suburbia felt familiar. Glad of the cold bite of winter persisting\
  \ just enough so I once again craved traditional hot chocolate, unmatched anywhere\
  \ else on the globe, but imitated plenty. Like soup, the dipping sauce and beverage\
  \ lights a small pit of warmth in the depths of your stomach. \n\nBecause 12 years\
  \ of palpable memories had converged to meet this moment. But instead of holding\
  \ Dad's hand and dancing for Mum's camera, I swapped my seven year old self for\
  \ the 19-year old trying to be a cosmopolitan while devouring paella and jam\xF3\
  n like a tourist. \xBFPor qu\xE9 no los dos?\n\nSpain is a place of old men playing\
  \ chess in the sun. Where cities slow down for siesta but begin their parties in\
  \ the early hours of the morning. Where people love to be in a crowd and where gaiety\
  \ is in the lines of everyone\u2019s faces. Where rapid Spanish lingo is shouted\
  \ across promenades and every sweet talker says \u201CHola Chica.\u201D \n\nWhere\
  \ coffee and a croissant is two euros. Where sugar coated churros are in abundance\
  \ and bread, potatoes and more bread rule every meal. But where the people are as\
  \ much of a reminder of the air, that you are in Espa\xF1a. \n\nMy seven year old\
  \ self, keen to string sentences together, befriended a young girl in our family\
  \ run hotel. El Cocheron was home in our first stay in Spain - Aranjuez. Carmen,\
  \ the only daughter of the family seemed all too eager for a break from her brothers;\
  \ a reprieve that manifested in the form of crafts, outings and many hours together\
  \ spent starting at a multicoloured pet turtle. \n\nEven when you're a tourist,\
  \ if they don\u2019t scoff at you butchering their language, the spaniards are always\
  \ happy to do one thing: talk. \n\nSo when I returned to the humble courtyard of\
  \ El Cocheron as a high school graduate trying to make my gap year live up to all\
  \ expectations, my nerves were dismissed by the confidence that I would be remembered.\
  \ In Aranjuez, just south of Madrid, home to the royal palace and dozens of gardens,\
  \ El Cocheron still stands. Still with bamboo stalks at its entrance, still with\
  \ an abundance of lanterns and still home to Carmen and her family. \n\nIn broken\
  \ Spanish I explained who I was. The seven year old who\u2019d learnt how to say\
  \ \u201Ctotasda sin nada\u201D (toast with nothing) to avoid being given traditional\
  \ Spanish fare of tomato for breakfast, who had visited in 2004. From behind her\
  \ son, now more dashing than I remembered him, Martha appeared from behind reception.\n\
  \nWithin seconds I was welcomed with open arms to their family once again. Martha\
  \ seemed older, but her hotel still stood proud as a family affair. She knew exactly\
  \ who I was. It wasn't long before Carmen and I found the best lemon granita in\
  \ Aranjuez's Town Hall Plaza and she helped me speak Spanish in a florist. Their\
  \ family was a reprieve from being an au pair and teaching children English while\
  \ doing their Spanish homework, a break from feeling like my home in their house\
  \ wasn't homely. Because in the flat in El Cocheron, with red bunting, profiteroles\
  \ and a gathering of the entire family for Carmen's brother Carlos' birthday, I\
  \ felt more at home than I had in months. \n\nAs a young girl I had loved Spain\
  \ for the chance to be adventurous, eat in tapas bars and watch my parents marvel\
  \ at cheap wine. It had been a metropolis of people, always buzzing late at night\
  \ and novelties like shoe shops with inside slippery slides for children. Spain\
  \ feels like the place I learnt a lot of things. The most important thing? Make\
  \ a Spanish friend, and you'll have them for life."
