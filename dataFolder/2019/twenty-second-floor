Text: "Twenty-Second Floor\n\nNone of us had moved in two hours. It was almost one\
  \ am and we were still drinking wine and munching on chips; a quick way to ease\
  \ away the awkwardness of living with strangers. It was my first night in Buenos\
  \ Aires with three unknown roommates. \n\nOnly one among us was a veteran; Nicole\
  \ had been living there for four months. So naturally, the spotlight moved towards\
  \ her and we put our hands under our chins and listened as she shared stories. Bedtime\
  \ came eventually, and as we got up to leave, Nicole mentioned one thing in passing,\
  \ an assumed drunken comment. \"Lila,\" she whispered, \"I hope you're not scared\
  \ of bats.\" Then she laughed and stumbled to her room. \n\nWe lived on the twenty-second\
  \ floor of our apartment building. The view was breathtaking, but the heat was staggering.\
  \ It was January, the peak of summer, and the sun never faltered. We tried fans.\
  \ Five of them. But even still, I would wake up at three am with my shirt drenched\
  \ in sweat. Eventually my roommates and I got in the habit of opening all the windows.\
  \ The problem was that Buenos Aires has crazy summer storms. I\u2019m usually a\
  \ deep sleeper but every time it rained, I would wake up from intense pounding noises\
  \ against my window. I thought they were raindrops. Then I would run around the\
  \ apartment and shut everything. \n\nOne Saturday night I was still up when it started\
  \ to rain, so I closed the windows in advance and slept all through the night. I\
  \ woke up in my bed the next morning and planned on staying there. It\u2019s the\
  \ best feeling - waking up Sunday morning, seeing the sunlight, and then ignoring\
  \ the natural wake up call because you can. The rain had washed the city and given\
  \ me a fresh new day: a large-scale Baptism. \n\nSo I opened my eyes, squeezed them\
  \ shut again, and started my dramatic I-just-woke-up-yawn. I began to pull my arm\
  \ up from under my pillow, but then I heard a squeak. I turned my head, and curled\
  \ up nicely in a nook beside my left ear was a creature that looked way too much\
  \ like a rat. I screamed, practically fell out of my bed, and sprinted towards my\
  \ door. But when I looked back, the rodent had sprouted wings! I yanked my door\
  \ open and the bat flew over my head and out of my room. Fight or flight \u2026\
  \ I learned it\u2019s not even a question for me. With no phone, no glasses, and\
  \ no keys I ran to the front door and screamed, \"Everyone get out, there\u2019\
  s a bat!\" Then the door slammed behind me. \n\nI no longer live in that apartment,\
  \ but my doorman, Hector, is still an A-list friend. I bring him cookies and we\
  \ chat weekly. Here's what happened after I fled the horror-movie scene. I took\
  \ the two-minute-long elevator downstairs and in mediocre Spanish I frantically\
  \ choked out my story without knowing the word for bat. Between the flapping motions\
  \ I was making with my arms and my desperate, cracking voice, Hector agreed to come\
  \ upstairs. Standing in the doorway of my apartment, he asked \u201CWhere is it?\u201D\
  \ Before I could even answer, we heard a shriek. The wise one, Nicole, ran out of\
  \ her room completely naked (her way of fighting the intense heat). She saw the\
  \ doorman and shrieked again. So I turned to Hector and said, \u201CI think it\u2019\
  s in her room.\u201D\n\nBrave Hector caught two bats that morning; the second found\
  \ hanging on the curtain rod above my bed. He also showed me an inch-wide crack\
  \ in my bedroom window. No rain had gotten in, only bats. In a longer version of\
  \ this story, I would tell you about how I found marks that looked suspiciously\
  \ like bat bites and the rabies shots that followed. But for now, I\u2019ll leave\
  \ you with this. On stormy nights, I would still hear the pounding of bats (not\
  \ rain) against my window. But when the rain cleared up, I always opened it again.\
  \ You just don\u2019t close the window when you have the best view of the city."
