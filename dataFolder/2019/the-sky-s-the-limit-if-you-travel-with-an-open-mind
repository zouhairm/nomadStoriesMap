Text: "Visiting Corsica this summer has been one of my best decisions of my life.\
  \ I fell in love with life again and after dealing with anxiety for a long time,\
  \ I\u2019ve finally found my inner peace. For once in my life I was in the moment\
  \ and nothing could have distracted me. We decided to visit an old fortress from\
  \ where we could watch the sunset. The hiking was killing us, but it was all worth\
  \ it once we reached the top. During our tour we met some twenty-year-olds from\
  \ Paris and we had an amazing picnic with them while sharing our stories and getting\
  \ to know each other. We were on the same page instantly and decided to go to some\
  \ new place together the next day. Coming down in the dark we were quiet and listened\
  \ to the animals around us, the sound of the waves. Once we got to our cars we headed\
  \ back to our camping. With these guys we proceeded to a market by the sea, where\
  \ they introduced us to an old lady, who has been making and selling these beautiful\
  \ jewelleries so she can support a young mother whose boyfriend died before the\
  \ baby was born. She invited us to her home and she presented a tragically beautiful\
  \ love story about her and her loved one. I\u2019m still mesmerized by it though\
  \ it\u2019s been so long. This is why you should travel, so you can get passionate\
  \ again, you have the chance to encounter these alluring souls that can truly change\
  \ the way you see the world and your problems. Traveling shouldn\u2019t be a matter\
  \ of your bank account when these fascinating cultures can define the person you\
  \ become. Don\u2019t just sit at home and scroll through your Instagram envying\
  \ these random people. Go out, even if it\u2019s in your city, put your phone down\
  \ and admire the life you have or see the potency the life you could create if you\
  \ would rank the things in your life according to your priorities.\nCause that\u2019\
  s what happened to me, I decided to take a gap year next year so I wouldn\u2019\
  t burnout, but help others and improve myself while getting closer to the woman\
  \ I aspire to be one day. \nAnd what happened later on that vacation? I was swimming\
  \ a lot, collected rubbish on the beach, visited caves, climbed mountains, tried\
  \ to cultivate my French while trying all these delicious meals that the locals\
  \ suggested. What happened to those young people? We still keep in touch with each\
  \ other and plan visit a new country some time or other, but the most important\
  \ is to courage others around us to live and love as long as they can.\nI\u2019\
  ve been lucky enough to see the world as a very few can and I\u2019d like to share\
  \ that with others. I\u2019m just an average girl from a small country with big\
  \ dreams, I don\u2019t have a platform with thousands or millions of followers.\
  \ I do believe that positive thinking, language learning and being assiduous will\
  \ help me find my voice, my paths and reach my goals.\n\nT\xEDmea Bodn\xE1r"
