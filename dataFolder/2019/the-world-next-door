Text: "When I first got to the United States, I wasn\u2019t carrying a bag full of\
  \ room for new shoes, nor stuffed with tickets for Disney parks, but filled with\
  \ old shirts, a file with immigration student forms, and a backpack with my notebook,\
  \ anxiety and fear. I had just been approved for an extension program at the University\
  \ of California, Los Angeles.\n\nI always wanted to study abroad, having thus the\
  \ opportunity to dive deeply into another culture, so when I reached the LAX airport,\
  \ butterflies started to party in my stomach. Planner by nature, I felt terrified\
  \ when I said \u201Cyes\u201D to a completely unknown place to stay. It was like\
  \ renting your new home before visiting it. Scary and exciting at the same time.\n\
  \nAfter paying an extra-charged taxi ride \u2013 \u201CAmerican taxes, ma\u2019\
  am.\u201D- I arrived at my new home: UCHA Co-op, the most famous student dormitory\
  \ in LA. The first impression was devastating: It was decadent and dirty. A young\
  \ office worker approached me and filled my papers, apparently not sure of his duties.\
  \ Then, he came up with questions such as \u201CMonday or Thursday for your chore\
  \ shift?\u201D, \u201CTriple or double?\u201D, \u201CFacilities or Kitchen?\u201D\
  . After a lot of \u201Cuhmm\u2019s\u201D to buy some time and make the \u201Cright\u201D\
  \ decisions, I finally got my key. \n\nThird floor, number 319, in the main building,\
  \ called \u201CHHH\u201D. The path to my room was a nightmare. Stained walls, broken\
  \ doors, trash cans clogged with useless objects and food leftovers. When I entered\
  \ the room, I saw the tiny space I\u2019d occupy from then on: One wardrobe, a bed,\
  \ and an office table. My roommate\u2019s side was stuffed with shoes and books,\
  \ spread all over the floor. She was a young American, and when she set her eyes\
  \ on me, she said: \u201CKeep in mind that you\u2019ll have to leave this room in\
  \ the next quarter, as my friend will return\u201D. What a lovely welcome! \n\n\
  UCHA Co-op is a cheap dormitory, where you pay 500 bucks a month to live one block\
  \ away from UCLA. It offers a place to sleep, three meals a day to fill your stomach,\
  \ laundry rooms, a garage, a pool table, a piano, study chambers, and a computer\
  \ room. A rare find, you might think. However, it\u2019s only cheap because students\
  \ are responsible for everything. There\u2019s one mandatory four-hour chore shift\
  \ per week, which could include cooking, emptying trashes, cleaning, gardening and\
  \ working at the office (just like the guy who welcomed me). If you don\u2019t want\
  \ to work, you pay someone else to do it. If you miss your shift, you\u2019ll be\
  \ fined in 40 dollars. The outcome is a self-sustainable economy and some tired\
  \ students carrying mops and pretending to clean the floor. \n\nWhen the initial\
  \ shock had passed, I decided to make some friends. So I used to sit on the couch\
  \ in the lobby, read books, and wait for someone to take a seat by my side. It worked,\
  \ and soon after that I had my own tribe: Two Indians, an American, a Chilean, a\
  \ Sri Lankan and a Korean. I ended up spending my nights downstairs, playing games,\
  \ listening to piano songs played by my peers, drinking wine, and curiously feeling\
  \ at home.     \n\nSince the co-opers do the cooking, we get the chance to try our\
  \ friends\u2019 recipes every day. Tamales, curry, orange chicken, the original\
  \ Italian pizza, and the Brazilian \u201Cbrigadeiro\u201D, prepared by me. Just\
  \ like traveling the world with only one flight ticket, Co-op is a mix of smells,\
  \ tastes, stories and accents. \n\nYou sit at a table to consume \u201Cdictatorship\
  \ in North Korea\u201D for breakfast, \u201Cneuroscience\u201D for lunch, and \u201C\
  football rules\u201D for dinner. It\u2019s like a new nation formed by students.\
  \ A place where 400 people (some living there for decades), from all over the world,\
  \ follow the same rules and share the same life style. \n\nIt sounds impossible,\
  \ but it\u2019s not. The world has much to learn from UCHA Co-op and its special\
  \ way of gathering nations under the same ceiling, with a bunch of conflicts, yes,\
  \ but no war whatsoever."
