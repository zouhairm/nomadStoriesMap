Text: "A few rekindling personal mythical experiences opened doors to the realms of\
  \ divine , compelled my logical mind to take a leap into the idea of rediscovering\
  \ the living of nomadic spiritual ascetics in the grace of God while mingling across\
  \ mass population, or being a part of the modern day economic conditions.\n\nOur\
  \ travel intentions had no definite path, apart from a destination (Goa, south west\
  \ of India) and an origin (Kolkata, east of india). And a limited budget of 10k\
  \ INR for buying essential supplies as Tents (2x2k=4k) , sleeping bags (1.5kx2=3k),\
  \ for 4 adults and one young free pet cat. The rest 3k was reserved for our cat\
  \ Mao's food.\nSo essentially we were zero budget on the highway ,late evening ,\
  \ seeking to head southwards for a probable journey of 2000 kms. \n\nOur first divine\
  \ grace was forwarded to us (following a visit to a kali temple) by a trucker ,\
  \ offering a ride until Orissa. Eventually got treated with dinner , following an\
  \ instant connection over divinity and musical interests. in 3days we were dropped\
  \ near a port. we were supposed to find our next ride , however we found locals\
  \ treating us with food and toilet access thanks to our musical blessings, until\
  \ the same truck picked us up to drop us at Cuttack! \nWe advanced banking on our\
  \ reserved cash for pet food ,found a bus, whose attendant forced us in (thanks\
  \ to Mao) ,reaching Berhampore. We pitched our tent for the night in the bus stop\
  \ , only to wakeup by screams  of \"Gopalpur!Gopalpur!\". Somehow my heart was drawn,we\
  \ straight went to Gopalpur, a beach town in southern Orissa . it was hosting its\
  \ annual beach festival. A welcoming vibe fragranced, with huge gathering of shops,\
  \ food , collectibles and tourists. Its Mao's first beach visit, and he finally\
  \ finds peace with it and continued enjoying hunting crabs, chilling with cat friendly\
  \ locals or tourists. We had to pitch our tent and settle, following rescue of a\
  \ puppy, badly injured!\nDuring our 4 day stay , the locals overwhelmed us with\
  \ food & intoxicants, living on the beach was extraordinary, all of us connecting\
  \ by common divine faith or musical interest. we were also interviewed by certain\
  \ school teachers , who forcefully donated a sum of money for our journey (an article\
  \ got published later about our object of journey). The final night , the love for\
  \ biryani(meat pilaf rice) (while momentarily being vegetarian) introduced us to\
  \ a group of young guys who proposed to take us for a local pilgrimage. The following\
  \ morning while we are busy packing up, the local police shows up, and again by\
  \ divine intervention a learned tourist objected at their harassment and made it\
  \ easier for us to leave freely after writing a safety acknowledgement and a song\
  \ in the glory of god. \nThe next 10 days hosted by the boys , brought us to experience\
  \ camping, hiking (Mao hiked 8 kms aswell) and simple ashram living in a few thousand\
  \ year old mythical folklore related ashram. The simplicity of living in nature\
  \ and by the grace of others with sustainability while being grateful was the divine\
  \ feeling that we never knew we were discovering for ourselves . \nWe were further\
  \ funded by others on the way , and we progressed towards andhra pradesh , with\
  \ other graceful truckers.\nA few pitstops , and sudden incidents of random strangers\
  \ treating our cat and dog (we picked the injured puppy along), kept showering divine\
  \ grace. We finally hit a challenge where we waited for over 10 hours failing to\
  \ find a ride, mentally braking down, a drive arrived taking us to a border temple\
  \ town , that fed us food and reassurance of faith. The next trucker, another divine\
  \ devotee ,shared about occurrence of divine light on that specific day(14th january),\
  \ which we watched live over our gadgets. \nwe finally reached Goa on 45th day ,visiting\
  \ friends in bangalore (the trucker dropped us there) with bus tickets to goa sponsored\
  \ by a brother, with a never before experience of divinity amongst humanity . \n\
  (one left before destination, other from Goa, while recovered puppy being mistakenly\
  \ stolen. we two friends and our cat lived merrily in Goa for 12 weeks serving musical\
  \ ecstacy and divine grace of Life )"
