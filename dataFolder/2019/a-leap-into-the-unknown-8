Text: "A leap into the unknown\nSophie Merkens\n\nI brace myself against the cold\
  \ to leap into the unknown. Well it's not quite unknown... I know it will be freezing.\
  \ I know it will be a shock.\n\nBut I leap anyways. I leap and for a mere second\
  \ or two I am completely free, mid fall in the blustery winter's air. And then I\
  \ plunge, deep below the icy surface, my naked body baptized by the turbulent, silvery\
  \ black sea. I float to the top, open my eyes to the beauty of snow hitting the\
  \ ocean then dissolving into waves, and I gasp for air. It is so cold I feel like\
  \ my lungs will not expand, like they're frozen with the Scandinavian winter and\
  \ won't be taking in any more oxygen until spring- which is still a long ways away.\n\
  \nFinally air enters my body and I paddle, taking in jagged breaths of snow and\
  \ air, whilst swimming as fast as my jumpstarted body can handle to the ladder.\
  \ There are icicles frozen from the rungs. I laugh- a delirious, wild, high-pitched\
  \ laugh. This is absurd. I am absurd!\n\nWho travels to Denmark on a bicycle then\
  \ decides on a whim to say the winter? Who the hell chooses to not see the sun for\
  \ weeks on end, for the days to be pitch black by mid afternoon, for the temperature\
  \ to be below zero for months? I do. I could be home in the southern hemisphere\u2019\
  s summer, or living in Spain right now, or cycling the length of Africa, or stealing\
  \ body heat from my latest lover in his cosy warm bed in Italy. But no... for once\
  \ the wanderlust traveller wanted to stay still, to travel within a city and a culture,\
  \ to be like a local- at least for the winter.\n\nI grab hold of the frozen ladder\
  \ with my white fingers, feeling pins and needles with each slight movement, hoping\
  \ my skin won't attach itself to the metal. I climb up and onto the promenade. Naked,\
  \ shivering, and feeling more alive than I have in a long while. My heart is booming\
  \ audibly in my ears, my breath a white cloud emerging from purple lips, my winter-bleached\
  \ skin almost translucent and covered entirely in goosebumps. Steam rises from me.\
  \ I stare down at my bare feet submerged in fresh snowfall, then tread carefully\
  \ to the door, wishing my extremities were numb, quickening my pace in pain until\
  \ I reach sanctuary.\n\nInside greets me like the summer just gone- hot, wet, full\
  \ of life and passion. The heat is startling. Divine. I nod \u2018god morgen\u2019\
  \ to the other winter bathers, then let myself defrost in the sauna.\n\nYes, I chose\
  \ this. Yes, this is still travelling. Yes, Danish winter can be grim. Yes, I had\
  \ forgotten what shadows were, for lack of sunshine, until I was surprised to see\
  \ one following me around yesterday- but it is divine to bathe in the stormy ocean,\
  \ in nothing but my birthday suit, to join in on a nation's pastime, to sit at the\
  \ Vikings Club and thaw out- physically and emotionally.\n\nI look around at the\
  \ naked bodies, the friends catching up on gossip, the heavily pregnant blonde (well,\
  \ they're nearly all blonds here), the old man wearing a felted hat to keep him\
  \ from over-heating, the young child joining her father to pour water over the hot\
  \ rocks. I have to close my eyes against the steam. I look around... and I'm damn\
  \ glad I leapt into the unknown."
