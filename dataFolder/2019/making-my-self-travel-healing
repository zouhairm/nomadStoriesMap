Text: "I was born in Ivory Coast, i grew up in Chile, I lived in France for 6 years\
  \ and I need to keep moving! \nIm 34 years old, I just got separated from my husband,\
  \ I just been fired from my job in a multinational company.All my friend are married\
  \ or with children..... I have a plant and home.\n\nI have 13 daily life books and\
  \ incontrollable hunger for life! I want to travel, to know the culture of the country\
  \ through its food and find my self in situations that I did expect. How to heal\
  \ wounds travelling, realizing that you are self-sufficient, as a single, strong\
  \ and funnie woman. I love writing because eveeything you write stays fixed in time,like\
  \ a tattoo. You will never grow old,you will never forget and that experience will\
  \ be there,everytime you read it again. \nIm a beautiful woman Chilean/African,\
  \ a singer,writer, actress,good lover and good cooker! No shame jajaj I would like\
  \ to have the opportunity on this trip to show other womans who feel like me that\
  \ we can always rebuild ourself,travel to expand our vision.... while we continue\
  \ moving, we will continue to grown. Our place is in our self,and not in a physical\
  \ place."
