Text: "It all started at the train station of Bourdeaux when we were going to Pauillac,\
  \ my husband and I were traveling through different regions of France, at that time\
  \ our intention was to visit the vineyard Chateau Mouton Rothschild, one of the\
  \ five Premier Cru Class\xE9, we don\xB4t speak french so the seller did not understand\
  \ us well and gave us tickets to... Bergerac?! Thank God we realized before boarding\
  \ and someone helped us change the tickets.\n\nWe lost the first train for be in\
  \ the line to bought sandwiches, uf!!!, we had to wait for the next one, the road\
  \ was extraordinary, seeing all the landscapes, eating our sandwich, and in the\
  \ distance... the Chateau Margaux wow!!! extraordinary.\n\nArriving in Pauillac\
  \ we saw that the train station is very small, and oh surprise for us, there were\
  \ no taxis and we had an appointment at Chateau Mouton Rotschild in about 30 minutes,\
  \ the only person who was at the ticket office didn\xB4t speak Spanish or English,\
  \ and we don\xB4t speak French, it must have been very funny to see us trying to\
  \ explain and understand each other.\n\nAt that moment, two people entered the station,\
  \ an elderly man who was going to say goodbye to his son, for the way they embraced\
  \ it seems that it would be a long trip. The son spoke a little bit of English,\
  \ as best we could we told him our destiny.\n\nThe son explained to his dad our\
  \ problem, and in French they were talking with the guy at the ticket office, it\
  \ seemed that he explained where the place we were going was, we were hopeful they\
  \ could help us get a taxi; the son turns and says \"My father go you\" with signs\
  \ he told us that his father would take us to our destination, we couldn\xB4t believe\
  \ it, we were a little embarrassed by the inconvenience that we would cause him,\
  \ but also very grateful for the kindness of all of them.\n\nWe wait for his son\
  \ to get on the train and we all say goodbye. Then we went out and the Sir took\
  \ us in his car, we realized that where we were going  was on the outskirts of the\
  \ town, a trip of about 15 minutes by a very nice little road, during the trip we\
  \ only saw each other and smiling, that we had no other way to communicate. Arriving\
  \ at our destination we decided to give the man a paper \u201Camate\" craft that\
  \ is handmade paper of tree bark and has a drawing representative of Mexico. He\
  \ didn\xB4t want to accept it, making us understand that it was not necessary, but\
  \ for us it was a fortune and an honor to meet him, and that he has helped us without\
  \ knowing us. We say goodbye not before taking a picture.\n\nBut our lucky day continued,\
  \ upon entering the Chateau we were welcome by a very nice girl, and we gave her\
  \ the gift of amate paper that we brought to her, she liked it a lot, she boasted\
  \ it with several of her workmates. We were treated to the best during the tour.\
  \ And something extraordinary happened, when we went through the barrel room they\
  \ were doing the transfer of a barrel, which is to pass the content of one barrel\
  \ to another leaving the sediment in the first, a man was doing it with a candle\
  \ down, to see when the waste starts to come out. At that time, he had a drink,\
  \ and he extended it to us so that we could taste the wine, we couldn\xB4t believe\
  \ it, it\xB4s one of the best qualified and highest priced wines in the market,\
  \ and there we were, testing it directly from the barrel. Our guide told us that\
  \ it was the first time she saw him do that.\n\nWe left the vineyard very happy,\
  \ we no longer cared that there were no taxis, we walked to the train station by\
  \ these small roads full of traditions and tranquility, with the greatest satisfaction\
  \ of having a day full of surprises and experiences, but more than anything full\
  \ of extraordinary people."
