Text: "In the tropical jungles of northern Thailand lies the ancient walled city of\
  \ Chang Mai. Inside the crumbling walls is a labyrinth of busy streets and narrow\
  \ alleys, lined with bars, temples and massage parlours.\n\nJenny and I were creeping\
  \ along one of these alleys, moving quickly through the shade of a high stone wall.\
  \ Jenny was up front, slinking past an old Thai woman folding laundry. Her right\
  \ arm was stiff by her side, pistol pointed at the cobblestones. I was bringing\
  \ up the rear, my rifle at the ready.\n\nWithout warning, a backpacker in a Hawaiian\
  \ shirt darted out from an alcove and doused Jenny with a bucket of water \u2013\
  \ SPLOOSH! She spun around, her face frozen with disgust, \u201CEww! He splashed\
  \ me with moat water! It went in my mooouth!!\u201D\n\nThis is a taste of Songkran,\
  \ Thailand\u2019s New Year\u2019s celebration. For hundreds of years, Thais have\
  \ practiced the annual tradition of pouring water over statues of the Buddha, to\
  \ signify purification and the washing away of bad luck. Over time, locals started\
  \ dribbling water on one another\u2019s foreheads, and somehow, this has evolved\
  \ into the largest water fight on the planet. Millions of tourists pour into Thailand\
  \ each April to participate in this wet and wild five day festival. Hotels and guesthouses\
  \ are booked solid and the streets are lined with pop-up stalls selling a dizzying\
  \ array of water-based weaponry.\n\nMy gun was ridiculous. It was some sort of off-brand,\
  \ Chinese Super-Duper Soaker with multiple air chambers and an enormous water reservoir.\
  \ It was as powerful as a pressure washer and would never pass safety standards\
  \ back home. To my dismay, Jenny had chosen a Winnie-the-Pooh squirt gun that had\
  \ all the velocity of a soap dispenser.\n\nBack in the alley, the American frat-bro\
  \ in the Hawaiian shirt was standing over my drenched girlfriend, chuckling to himself.\
  \ I took aim and squeezed the trigger, sending a stinging jet of revenge hissing\
  \ through the air. It caught the brim of his Yankees cap, sending it flipping off\
  \ his head. The second shot zapped him in the neck. \u201COW! Dude! That really\
  \ hurts!\u201D\n\nRunning from the scene of the crime, Jenny and I spilled out of\
  \ the alleyway, into a raging river of people. The scene was pure chaos; a tangled\
  \ mass of wet humans, screaming, shouting and shooting criss-crossing jets of water\
  \ through the air like Silly String. The street was bumper to bumper with pickup\
  \ trucks, each carrying a Thai family huddled around a garbage can filled with water\
  \ and a giant block of ice. They scooped out the water with soup ladles and enamel\
  \ coffee mugs, slopping the freezing cold liquid on the people below. Seething around\
  \ the trucks were scores of drunk tourists, each armed with a Super Soaker, picking\
  \ off Thais like fish in a barrel. It hardly seemed fair, but the Thais were good-natured\
  \ about their clear disadvantage.\n\nThai people are incredibly warm and hospitable,\
  \ but I was starting to get the feeling that they were just tolerating us. As a\
  \ tourist, I felt like I\u2019d never be able to step outside the role of \"the\
  \ guest\u201D because the Thais never broke character from playing \u201Cthe gracious\
  \ host\u201D. It felt like there was a gap between us.\n\nLater that night, during\
  \ the evening cease-fire, Jenny and I showered and left our guesthouse in clean,\
  \ dry clothes. We were relieved not to be soaking wet for a change, and excited\
  \ to have some dinner \u2013 trust me, nothing tastes quite so good as Thai food\
  \ from Thailand.\n\nAs we strolled down the alley, I was startled to find a little\
  \ Thai girl blocking our path. She stood in an aggressive fighting stance, her fierce\
  \ eyes locked on mine. In her hands was a small red bucket, the kind children use\
  \ to build sandcastles. It was full of water.\n\n\u201CWait,\u201D I said, holding\
  \ up my hands, \u201Cit\u2019s nighttime! The water fight is over!\u201D The little\
  \ girl swung her bucket and a frozen pane of water, like a shimmering liquid ghost,\
  \ arced through the air \u2013 SPLOOSH!\n\nI stood there motionless and dripping\
  \ while the two girls roared with laughter. I didn\u2019t think it was funny at\
  \ all."
