Text: "My trip to Istanbul started long before I physically visited the city. Since\
  \ I was a kid, Turkish tv took over our entertainment culture and our favorite way\
  \ to spend time was watching Turkish programs. The complicated twist plots took\
  \ us by surprise and we admired the good looking actors. When my Turkish friend\
  \ asked me to come over, I didn\u2019t think twice and spontaneously booked myself\
  \ a ten days trip to the Golden City. On a sunny and warm day of November, quite\
  \ rare for the time of year, I started my day with a Turkish breakfast- and what\
  \ a start it was! Coming from the Middle East, breakfast plays a huge part of our\
  \ day, so it was no surprise to see the table filled with fresh vegetables, cheeses,\
  \ olives and eggs, but this breakfast was a different experience.  \nHitting the\
  \ morning traffic toward the Bosphorus we took a boat ride, a normal everyday transportation\
  \ way for my friend, but a totally new experience for me. Equipped with fresh simit,\
  \ or Turkish bagel we bought on our way, we passed from one part of the city, the\
  \ European part to the Asian part.  This was the exact moment I fell in love with\
  \ Istanbul.\n The view was breathtaking. Big Mosques such as the Blue Mosque and\
  \ Santa Sofia sitting on the high heels, Galata tower looking at us from distance,\
  \ Maidens tower in the middle of the sea, blue skies and fresh air- no wonder this\
  \ was the heart of one of the biggest empires. Arriving to the European part we\
  \ went to the Bazar, a famous market full of mats, spices, fabrics and anything\
  \ you could think of. I couldn\u2019t stop thinking that I am walking in the same\
  \ place the biggest conquests walked once. These aromas, colors and flavors survived\
  \ thru periods, seasons and people. The magical atmosphere caught me by surprise.\
  \ I couldn\u2019t reject a hot baklava with pistachios, the tastiest Baklava I have\
  \ ever had, and as a middle eastern I had a lot of amazing baklavas. Continuing\
  \ our tour toward the Blue Mosque, we stopped for lunch. Turkish people have a special\
  \ connection with food, and I am sure this is how they manage to conquer a big part\
  \ of the world. Hot meat with cold yogurt, mixed with exotic spices is one of my\
  \ favorite dishes and every bite was followed by a deep delighted voices causing\
  \ my friend a laughing attack at my reactions. Another cup of tea before leaving,\
  \ cause you can never have enough tea in Turkey and voil\xE0 we are in front of\
  \ the most beautiful Mosque I have ever seen- The Blue Mosque also known as Sultan\
  \ Ahmet Camii.  It is the last great mosque of the classical period. The perfection\
  \ of its 6 minarets, domes and hand painted blue tiles, can be captured by eyes\
  \ only. This was my first time in a mosque, let alone an important one. The second\
  \ structure I wanted to see the most, Hagia Sophia was just couple meters away from\
  \ the mosque, was built in 537 as an Orthodox cathedral but later converted into\
  \ an Ottoman mosque it\u2019s a mixture of cultures, ethnicities and periods. Catholic\
  \ and Islam influence working magic to give the place a whimsical feeling. To finish\
  \ off our day we decided to walk near the pier, the suns going down colored the\
  \ sky a fiery orange and gave the air a crisp feeling mixed with saltiness of the\
  \ water. Fishermen were still fishing near the edge of the water, their buckets\
  \ full of smelly fishes. Constantinople is so big but so serene and quiet in a special\
  \ way, it\u2019s very old but very clean and the people are so kind and inviting.\
  \ Everywhere I looked I saw history, reminder of an old, golden era. Time made only\
  \ justice to her and intensified its whimsical power adding new to the old and metallic\
  \ to the gold."
