Text: "My only point of reference prior to arriving in Florence was what James Ivory\
  \ portrayed in his 1985 film \"A Room with a View.\"\nIt is safe to say that modern\
  \ day Florence is quite difference to what I saw on that grainy VHS that I had borrowed\
  \ from the local library. \n\nI have to admit that I had a heavily romanticised\
  \ image of Italy; and honestly, who doesn't?\nFor those of us who have grown up\
  \ outside of greater Europe, we are drawn to it because of its charm. \nWe've grown\
  \ up seeing images of these faraway places, whether is be the food, the history\
  \ or the monuments; we're eventually coaxed into dipping into our savings to discover\
  \ Europe for ourselves. \nNow nearing my second year of living in Europe, I have\
  \ still only seen the tip of the iceberg.\nThere is something exhilarating about\
  \ popping over to another country for the weekend.\nA long weekend, combined with\
  \ a hunger for some good Italian pizza lured me over the Mediterranean. \n\nAfter\
  \ two flights from my current home in Spain, followed by a four hour train ride\
  \ from Fiumicino Airport, I was expecting to step off the train at Santa Maria Novella\
  \ and be swept up into a passionate Italian love affair where we would struggle\
  \ to communicate due to the language barrier.\nInstead, I was met with a thriving\
  \ tourist destination where a multitude of languages can be heard on every street\
  \ corner. \n\nI was amazed by the fact that so many people spoke English, but at\
  \ the same time disappointed that I wouldn't be blissfully lost in translation.\
  \ I actually wanted to go through the struggle of trying to survive in a language\
  \ that I was barely conversational in. \nI am embarrassed to admit that I spent\
  \ my first day in Florence frustrated because people would promptly switch to English\
  \ when they saw me struggling to get Italian words out. I couldn't even focus on\
  \ the tranquility of the Arno, the grandeur of the Duomo nor the succulent Florentine\
  \ steak. \n\nIt is a bittersweet irony that my love for Florence truly blossomed\
  \ in my last hour in the city. \nI was walking around the Mercato Centrale, when\
  \ I stopped by one of the many delis. The man behind the counter and I began to\
  \ chat in a hilarious combination of Italian, Spanish and English. This mixture\
  \ somehow meant we understood each other perfectly well, and soon he was offering\
  \ me all sorts of tasty morsels of the cheese and cured meat he had to offer. \n\
  \nMore people began to gather; a couple from Rio de Janeiro, a Persian woman, a\
  \ husband and wife from Bordeaux, a Japanese mother and daughter duo, and two other\
  \ coworkers at the deli. \nIt was then that we had this small, fleeting, magical\
  \ moment. We were all enjoying the freshly sliced prosciutto and chunks of truffle\
  \ pecorino, chatting away about our love for Italian cuisine in our hodgepodge of\
  \ languages. \n\nPerhaps my experience in Florence wasn't quite how I originally\
  \ imagined it to be. \nHowever, it is quite amazing to think that this unique collection\
  \ of people happened upon the same deli at the same time. \nAn apt experience in\
  \ this global age, and one that makes for a colourful souvenir story to take home\
  \ with your hunk of parmigiano reggiano."
