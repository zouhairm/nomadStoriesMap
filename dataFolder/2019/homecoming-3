Text: "\u201CIf you bury your feet in the sand, they won't get burned.\u201D As simple\
  \ as it was, this is still the best piece of advice my grandmother ever gave me.\
  \ Just one of many I received from her every time we visited El Coco Beach in Guanacaste.\
  \ It's been almost five years since she passed away and I still hadn't been able\
  \ to gather up the courage to come back before today. \n\nThe picturesque dirt pathway\
  \ that guided to my grandparent's house is gone, in its place lies a dull and lifeless\
  \ asphalt rode. Gelato shops and surfboard rentals have taken over the colorful\
  \ dragon fruit trees that once decorated the roadside. A part of me is almost glad\
  \ my grandmother didn't live to see so much change in the small town she held so\
  \ dearly in her heart. \n\nIn the distance, I can see the rusted red gate that leads\
  \ to the memory ridden property I have been dreading to come back to. Once past\
  \ it, the modernized town on the outside fades away. It feels like I have stepped\
  \ into a museum installment of beloved recollections from my childhood. The only\
  \ sound that can be heard is the cracking of the dry leaves surrendering to the\
  \ car's weight. \n\nThe house looks exactly the same. From the horrible pink tiles\
  \ my grandfather decided to cover the bathroom with, to the bent tree outside the\
  \ window that was reshaped by a fourteen-year-old me trying to learn how to drive.\
  \ Even though outside is almost 40 degrees Celsius, somehow the inside of the house\
  \ feels colder than usual. \n\nNostalgia and sorrow invade me, and there is nothing\
  \ I can do but to reminisce over what is now gone. Some of my favorite memories\
  \ were created at this place. Whether it was a long night fighting with my brother\
  \ over his evident cheating at Monopoly or watching the sunset with my grandmother\
  \ at the beach. \n\nI still remember how my grandmother's snoring would keep me\
  \ up all night. I would joke about how it sounded like a malfunctioning woodchopper.\
  \ Tonight the deafening silence is the only thing preventing me from falling asleep.\n\
  \nThe next afternoon I leave the house and walk to the beach. Among the many new\
  \ shops and kiosks, there is one I recognize. This old ice cream stand where my\
  \ grandparents used to get smoothies for all the family during the summer, it fills\
  \ me with joy to know that not everything has changed entirely. I buy a chocolate\
  \ chip smoothie and sit on a log near the water.\n\nThere's a certain beauty about\
  \ the sea that has always fascinated me. This is the same place in which my grandmother\
  \ saw her first sunset, so did I, and so will my grandchildren. This same ocean\
  \ was here before me, and will continue to be after I'm gone. As scary as it sounds,\
  \ this helps me realize that there are certain things in life which will be sad\
  \ and difficult, but life will always find a way to present its beauty to us. As\
  \ the last rays of sunlight find their place beyond the horizon, I bury my feet\
  \ on the ground and smile. I am home."
