Text: "The Wild Vegetarian\n\n\n\nOn a bright summer day, I and my friend embarked\
  \ on our short trip to the most unique temple - Ananthapura Lake Temple. Located\
  \ in God's Own Country - Kerala, it is the only temple that is located in the middle\
  \ of a lake.\n\nIn Hindu culture, it is believed that going to a temple is auspicious\
  \ before you begin a new journey in your life. This will bring you good luck on\
  \ your way up the ladder! It was indeed a new journey for us because we were about\
  \ to start our career. \n\nIn between our homes in Mangalore and the lake temple\
  \ in Ananthapura, lies 46 km distance filled with lush greenery and the tropical\
  \ weather. \n\nOn our way to the lake temple, the wild greenery was interspersed\
  \ by farmland that had hundreds of coconut and areca nut trees. These closely packed\
  \ and slightly bowing trees looked like people offering silent prayers to the vast\
  \ Arabian Sea lying a few kilometers away, on the right side. \n\nWhen we arrived\
  \ at the temple, we were welcomed by two holy Kamba (pillars). We dropped our footwear\
  \ in the chappal stand, placed on the right-hand side of the pillars. \n\nWe climbed\
  \ down the staircase and into the ancient hall. Through this hall, I could see the\
  \ Garbhagudi (Sanctum) of the temple. Worshipers silently prayed on the elevated\
  \ platform on either side of the hall. The temple filled me with positive feelings.\
  \ \n\nWhen we were at the end of the hall, our eyes were greeted with the complete\
  \ spectacular view of the temple. The Garbhagudi was nestled in the middle of a\
  \ huge lake surrounded by even more greenery. There was a footbridge from the hall\
  \ that led to the sanctum. As I started walking down the bridge, I noticed tiny\
  \ fishes swimming in the lake. At the end of the bridge was a small platform beyond\
  \ which was the Garbhagudi. \n\nThe temple was not crowded as it was a weekday.\
  \ I walked around the platform to reach the entrance to the Garbhagudi. There, Lord\
  \ Vishnu was majestically watching over all of us. The poojari (priest) was offering\
  \ flowers to the mighty god. I closed my eyes peacefully and thanked the god for\
  \ providing me with the stepping stone to the bright future. \n\nI turned to the\
  \ right taking in the surrounding and that is when I saw it with horror! A priest\
  \ was placing a large ball of rice directly into the mouth of a gigantic Crocodile!\n\
  \nIt took awhile for me to take the entire scene in. I was horror-stricken, out\
  \ of my wits, and rooted to the spot. The priest offering flowers smiled at me and\
  \ led me near the crocodile. \u201CBabiya,\u201D he said, \u201Cis her name\u201D\
  . I watched as Babiya opened her giant mouth, that could easily swallow a 2-year-old,\
  \ and gulped down the entire rice ball at one shot. \n\nWhen I came to my senses,\
  \ I blurted out questions. The priest patiently explained to me about her. Babiya\
  \ has lived here for as long as everyone can remember. She is a vegetarian crocodile.\
  \ The poojari calls her 'God's own crocodile\u2019.\n\nBabiya has not harmed a single\
  \ human (or fish!) till date. It eats the Prasada (sweet) offered by the temple.\
  \ In addition, the priests feed her with rice balls every afternoon with their own\
  \ hands!\n\nOnce the priest was done feeding her, I saw her drift away to the shore\
  \ and lay there sunbathing with her mouth wide open. The only time I had such a\
  \ close encounter with a crocodile was in the Mysore Zoo, with many sturdy metal\
  \ fences lying in between us.\n\nSlowly my horror turned into admiration. Admiration\
  \ for not only the humans who trusted her, but to the intelligent creature swimming\
  \ around them in such close quarters. \n\nThe world is filled with violence and\
  \ hatred. Humans kill humans everywhere and yet, here she was, the otherwise, human-killing\
  \ beast, gloriously resting in the shore harming no human ever! She was truly God's\
  \ own crocodile!\n\nThat day, I had new hope for our world. I wondered what Steve\
  \ Irwin would have had to say about human-loving Babiya."
