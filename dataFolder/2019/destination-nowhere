Text: "These men have a story, like everyone in this life, whether they are recognized\
  \ or not. However, I\u2019m not going to tell you the story about these men, I\u2019\
  m going to tell you mine. It begins with us leaving the hustle and bustle of Reykjav\xED\
  k city center in search of something unique and off the beaten path. As we walked\
  \ out with no direction in mind, we found ourselves journeying into a quaint residential\
  \ area admiring the architecture and watching the locals go about their daily lives.\
  \ In the distance there\u2019s this large spectacular dome, not knowing what it\
  \ was, what it\u2019s for or even where it really was. I eagerly pointed and said\
  \ \u201Clet\u2019s go there!\u201D So, we walked passed the neighborhoods, across\
  \ the highway and up a lonely hill. This adventure lead to a grey building with\
  \ a large red Icelandic sign indicating danger.(because danger signs can be recognized\
  \ in any language) we soon realized this was probably not the right way and that\
  \ we shouldn\u2019t be in this area. After coming to this realization, we decided\
  \ to just peak behind this \u201Cdangerous\u201D building anyway, and behind there\
  \ was a random snow covered trail, so of course we decided we needed to see where\
  \ this would lead. As we hiked up the slush and ice to what we thought was just\
  \ going to be a beautiful summit of the city, my friend Jess says to me \u201Cwhat\
  \ if this trail leads us to the dome?!\u201D I laugh and think that would be way\
  \ too convenient....as we climb to the top clenching on to tree limbs, grabbing\
  \ onto rocks and anything else we can grab, we finally reached the end and there\
  \ it was... the dome! We were so excited that we took off running as if we had just\
  \ found the rescue center from the post apocalyptic world of the Walking Dead.(seriously,\
  \ guys Iceland really does looks like that...only with more lava haha) Greeting\
  \ us at the entrance were these men, these very interesting men that have stories\
  \ but were never told. No signs no description, such as life...So, here I am telling\
  \ you my pointless story that actually has so much meaning.\nP.S. that day I ended\
  \ up eating lunch in the sky. Adventure on, my friends. Don\u2019t try to plan out\
  \ your life it\u2019s all about the journey.\n\n(This story has a picture associated\
  \ with it...I could not find a way to upload it with the post.)"
