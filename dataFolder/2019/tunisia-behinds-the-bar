Text: "Tunisia' a country of north africa mostly people know by Mediterranean sea\
  \ costsline and strategic location have attracted conquerors and visitors throughout\
  \ the ages, and its ready access to sahara has brought its  people into contact\
  \ with the habit of African interior. According to greek legend, a princess of Tyre,\
  \ was the first outsider to settle among the native tribes of what is now Tunisia\
  \ when she founded the city of Carthage in the 9th century bce. Although the story\
  \ is certainly apocryphal, Carthage nonetheless grew into one of the great cities\
  \ and preeminent powers of antiquity, and its colonies and entrep\xF4ts were scattered\
  \ throughout the western Mediterranean region. Carthage fought a series of wars\
  \ with its rival, Rome. Rome prevailed in the mid-2nd century bce, razed Carthage,\
  \ and ruled the region for the following 500 years. In the 7th century Arab conquerors\
  \ converted the native Berber (Amazigh) population of North Africa to Islam. The\
  \ area was ruled by a succession of Islamic dynasties and empires until coming under\
  \ French colonial rule in the late 19th century. After achieving independence in\
  \ 1956, Tunisia pursued a progressive social agenda and sought to modernize its\
  \ economy under two long-serving presidents, Habib Bourguiba and Zine al-Abidine\
  \ Ben Ali. However, Tunisia remained an authoritarian state with an all-powerful\
  \ ruling party and no significant institutions of representative government. (For\
  \ a discussion of political changes in Tunisia in 2011, see Jasmine Revolution.\
  \ Tunisia\u2019s culture is highly diverse, in part because of long periods of Ottoman\
  \ and then French rule but also because populations of Jews and Christians have\
  \ lived among a Muslim majority for centuries. Similarly, the capital, Tunis, blends\
  \ ancient Arab souks and mosques and modern-style office buildings into one of the\
  \ most handsome and lively cities in the region. Other cities include Sfax (\u1E62\
  af\u0101qis), Sousse (S\u016Bsah), and Gab\xE8s (Q\u0101bis) on the fertile coast\
  \ and Kairouan (Al-Qayraw\u0101n) and El-Kef (Al-K\u0101f) in the arid interior.\n\
  \nTunisia\u2019s people are renowned for their conviviality and easygoing approach\
  \ to daily life, qualities that Albert Memmi captured in his 1955 autobiographical\
  \ novel Pillar of Salt:\n\n    We shared the ground floor of a shapeless old building,\
  \ a sort of two-room apartment. The kitchen, half of it roofed over and the rest\
  \ an open courtyard, was a long vertical passage toward the light. But before reaching\
  \ this square of pure blue sky, it received, from a multitude of windows, all the\
  \ smoke, the smells, and the gossip of our neighbours. At night, each locked himself\
  \ in his room, but in the morning, life was always communal.\n\nThis warmth, joined\
  \ with the country\u2019s renowned hospitality and cuisine, has contributed greatly\
  \ to Tunisia\u2019s growing popularity as a destination for tourists from throughout\
  \ Europe and the Americas. This is usually story of Tunisia how about story behind\
  \ the bar from there story that people unknown before?"
