Text: "Ramallah might as well have been located on the moon for all I knew or cared\
  \ about it.  My friend, and Jerusalem-based tour guide, Asaf, had promised that\
  \ we would end my superb week-long stay in Israel with a two-day trip to the Golan\
  \ Heights, camping out and cracking beers in the gorgeous late-September sunshine.\
  \  The day of the proposed jaunt, he called me early.  He had picked up a late (but\
  \ lucrative) tour booking which would take him across to Tel-Aviv for three days,\
  \ effectively leaving me marooned.  I stewed for a few minutes in anger, but would\
  \ not assign him blame; work is work.  What options were now on the table?  Should\
  \ I try a visit to Palestine?  He couldn\u2019t have brought me there because of\
  \ the ongoing civil conflict and he being an Israeli national.  But, being Irish,\
  \ I should expect to be safe at least.\n\nThe bus from Jerusalem to Ramallah did\
  \ not break the (west) bank, and upon boarding I noticed that it was populated by\
  \ around twelve others.  Most of them were conversing animatedly in Arabic, a language\
  \ that I had not had the time to confront (nor, for that matter, Hebrew - though\
  \ regarding the latter Asaf had armed me with some nifty phrases to aid me along\
  \ the way).  I flicked through a small phrase book, procured moments before departure,\
  \ aware that a white man essentially humming Arabic phrases would seem to defy the\
  \ best of logic. \n\nRamallah translates as either \u2018God\u2019s hill\u2019 or\
  \ \u2018God above\u2019 yet, regardless of the celestial connotations of the city\u2019\
  s name, I was soon to discover that one of the most venerated Palestinian figures\
  \ of recent times had a burial site all to himself, located within walking distance\
  \ of the small but boisterous city centre.  The individual in question - Yasser\
  \ Arafat.  During and after his life, he has been subject to various labels, justified\
  \ or otherwise: radical, visionary, terrorist, pariah... and my first recollection\
  \ was of watching news footage of him during the 2001 \u2018Intifada\u2019 holy\
  \ war fought against Israel.  \n\nI reached the entrance, only to be greeted by\
  \ a massive tank.  Feeling intimidated, I deigned to withdraw but, at that moment,\
  \ a soldier emerged from behind the war machine.  The sun would hardly relent, and\
  \ I couldn\u2019t believe that this man could wear his flak jacket comfortably and\
  \ without wilting.  I ventured to tell him in stuttering, phonetic Arabic that I\
  \ was looking for the grave of Mr Arafat.  He smiled, appreciative of my linguistic\
  \ gymnastics, and beckoned me onward.  The tomb itself resembled a massive doorstop\
  \ carved from lustrous alabaster rock, resplendently decorated in broad Arabic-alphabet\
  \ strokes and guarded by two taut sentries situated on either side.\n\n\u201CYou\
  \ like photo?\u201D a man says in English. \nAbout to leave after this shot-like\
  \ experience, my chaperone arrested my stride with this wholly unexpected offer\
  \ of a longer drink.\n\u201CReally?\u201D\n\u201CYes, sure.\u201D\nThe chaperone\
  \ directed me to stand in front of the tomb, forming a sort of triangle with the\
  \ cyborg-esque guards.  What kind of pose could I strike?  Certainly a smile was\
  \ out of the question.  Quickly, I settled on a dignified \u201Cpassport photo\u201D\
  \ style countenance.  SNAP.  SNAP.  SNAP. \n\nStraightaway when I left the compound,\
  \ I checked the images, and almost buckled.  None of these would appear on Facebook\
  \ or the likes, of that I was certain.  My own expression betrayed me as a bit goofy,\
  \ but I didn\u2019t care.  Looking at the cyborgs\u2019 faces, it appeared that\
  \ one of them let a slight smile slip \u2013 a good-looking fellow for sure.  I\
  \ then considered fully the importance of this site, of Yasser, of his legacy. \
  \ And that these soldiers, the smiling one in particular, did not conform to the\
  \ sometimes pernicious Palestinian stereotype.  On this thought, tears mobilised\
  \ behind my eyelids, and broke through a frail and unwilling defence.  As it transpired,\
  \ I cried all the way back to the hostel, trying not to attract attention.  For\
  \ jsut such a mission, I was lucky that my sunglasses served as a suitable shield."
