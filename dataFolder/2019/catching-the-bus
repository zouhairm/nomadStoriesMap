Text: "I feel as if I\u2019m carrying a bucket of bricks. My skin prickles with sweat\
  \ as my shoulders strain under the weight of my backpack. In front of me my brother\
  \ trudges through Norwich Airport toward the exit. Our sleep deprived eyes blink\
  \ in the assaulting light of early morning as we step outside onto the deserted\
  \ sidewalk. Warm sunbeams cascade down, a pleasant surprise from the rainy English\
  \ weather anticipated. We both begin to hunt for the bus stop, eagerly imagining\
  \ the bliss of sitting down and removing our backpacks. Like a pair of mice stuck\
  \ in a cruel maze we circle the car park and scan the roadside, the bus station\
  \ continuing to elude us at every turn. After several more futile minutes we dejectedly\
  \ head back toward the airport\u2019s main entrance only to see an unassuming bus\
  \ stop just down the road from where we had been looking.\n\nWe force our feet to\
  \ take us the last few steps, finally heaving off our burdens and letting the crisp\
  \ November air refresh our skin. An elderly couple is already waiting at the station,\
  \ radiating a calm energy as they talk quietly to each other. A quick glance at\
  \ the bus schedule tells me that we\u2019ve found the right place, but after the\
  \ folly of finding the station I opt to double check with the couple. They turn\
  \ and take notice of us, their eyes lighting up at the chance to help two young\
  \ foreign travelers find their way. They confirm that yes; we are indeed at the\
  \ correct bus stop. I feel more at ease knowing that my brother and I have two comrades\
  \ with us, that if the bus fails to show or some other calamity befalls us we\u2019\
  re not alone. The woman, sitting on the bus station bench and surrounded by the\
  \ couple\u2019s luggage, turns to us and asks where we\u2019re from. Thus begins\
  \ a lovely conversation between my brother and I and the woman, her husband standing\
  \ behind her and occasionally injecting his thoughts into the verbal arena. We learn\
  \ that they are finally arriving home after a trip to visit Washington D.C. I ask\
  \ how they like living in Norwich and the pride for their hometown becomes immediately\
  \ apparent as they speak fondly of its university and lush countryside.\n\nOur conversation\
  \ draws to an end as the rather unpunctual bus makes its appearance, its breaks\
  \ hissing as it pulls up beside us. My brother pulls two five pound notes from his\
  \ wallet, leftover UK money from our previous trip. We wrestle our backpacks on\
  \ again as the elderly couple boards the bus, finally stepping up behind them and\
  \ handing the driver our bills. With a quick glance at our money he says without\
  \ hesitation \u201CI can\u2019t take these notes, these are the old ones. We can\
  \ only accept the new notes.\u201D I turn to my brother, unsure of what to do, as\
  \ he starts to ask the driver if there\u2019s any other way to pay with a credit\
  \ card. The driver, clearly wishing that he could help us somehow, only shakes his\
  \ head no. My brother steps down to exit the bus and I turn to follow him, all of\
  \ a sudden hearing \u201Cyou two aren\u2019t going anywhere.\u201D I turn and see\
  \ the husband from the couple at the bus station standing up and opening his wallet.\
  \ \u201CI\u2019ll pay for their fare,\u201D he says to the driver as he pulls out\
  \ several bills. I am immediately both relieved and amazed that a stranger that\
  \ I met only ten minutes ago would be so generous. The driver, with a kind glimmer\
  \ in his eye, then informs the husband that the type of ticket he had purchased\
  \ allows up to four people to travel under it so therefore we could board for free.\
  \ Thanking both the driver and the couple, we step back onto the bus and finally\
  \ get to sit and rest our weary feet. I don\u2019t remember the names of that British\
  \ couple, but I will forever be grateful for their benevolence and warm energy that\
  \ made the start of our trip just a little bit easier."
