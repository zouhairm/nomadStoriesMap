Text: "I remember the day I decided to take a leap into the unknown . I was deep in\
  \ thought trying to find ways to deal with the scars of my yearning for something\
  \ new . How did I get myself  in this situation.How do i get out and it occurred\
  \ to me that I needed a trip. I needed to clear my head. \nAll of these negative\
  \ thoughts were consuming me slowly. Thoughts about the uncertainty of my future.This\
  \ year has been rough and all of the things I had planned had failed dismally. I\
  \ needed to breathe. I thought of all the positive places i could go too, but Cape\
  \ town in South Africa was always in my heart \nI have never been there , ...'The\
  \ Cape of good hope',that's what they call it.I knew I needed a new found hope and\
  \ the city of Cape town ,called me by name. \n\nI packed my stuff and took the first\
  \ flight I could find.For  the first time in a while I was excited. I actually looked\
  \ forward to something and it felt good.\n\nOn arrival to my hotel I was tired but\
  \ i could feel it in the air that a good change was about to come .I just could\
  \ not point it out. I rested that day in new  surroundings but I felt at home.I\
  \ slept like a baby.\n\nThe following day the  sun was shining and welcoming .\n\
  I didn't have any plans but I decided to go to the well known table mountain. 'I\
  \ would be dumb not to go actually' it's the main attraction. I brought my camera\
  \ along with me and I loved the colourful buildings  ,the warmth of the people and\
  \  the vibe of the street vendors.It was like a rhythm of a song that one could\
  \  only feel by being present at that moment.It was beautiful. It was lively.\n\n\
  I was finally at  the entrance at table mountain waiting to go explore the sight.\
  \ I finally got in and I took a couple of Instagram  worthy pictures, as one should.\
  \ The wind was swiftly blowing, it was so calm ,my mind and heart were at ease.\
  \ As I watched the clouds dress Table mountain or the splendour.It was like a table\
  \ decked with magic.  The sun was highlighting all of its curves and I felt that\
  \ a higher power was present.\n\n It was a calmness  of joy I couldn't explain but\
  \ i could feel it and it was like my old self welcoming something new ,while also\
  \ letting go of the old. I began walking up while enjoying the founa and flora I\
  \ saw a very smooth rock I picked it up.\n\n As I continued on my quest with the\
  \ rock in my hand something came to me . It informed ne that I should have faith\
  \ in the world and myself one last time. I decided to declare all of my hopes and\
  \ dreams. I had no limitations I put it all out for the universe.\n\n Teary eyed\
  \ I felt that I had said all that I needed to say and it was final.That is   when\
  \ I knew that I was at the right place ,at the right time with the right state of\
  \ mind to give myself another shot at life.I told myself I'm going harder than I\
  \ have ever went and that instead of looking for instant results ,I'm going to trust\
  \ the process and trust My self once more .\n\nI decided to examine the  rock in\
  \ my  hand and to my surprise it had HOPE etched on it . With a new perspective\
  \ I  carried my hope in my hand and left with it to a life full of content."
