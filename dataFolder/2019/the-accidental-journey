Text: "After a long tiring day at work I boarded an AC sleeper bus to Rampur from\
  \ New Delhi. \n\nFor those who don\u2019t know what a sleeper bus is, it looks like\
  \ this.\nAs I couldn\u2019t get single berth I booked the first upper double berth.\
  \ I reserved window side hoping for another female to accommodate the aisle side.\
  \ The driver informed me that a lady named Pooja will board the aisle side. Bus\
  \ started around 10.30 pm and I fell asleep instantly.\n\nAround 12:00 am boarded\
  \ a couple with a kid sound asleep, not more than 2 years old.\n\nThe wife was supposed\
  \ to take the berth next to me; apart from the seat next to me they have also booked\
  \ the last lower double berth for the husband and the kid. At least that\u2019s\
  \ what I thought.\n\nTo my surprise the wife went ahead to the lower double berth\
  \ while the husband hurriedly placed the kid next to me and rushed to his wife.\
  \ I called him and asked why the kid was left unattended; he told that the wife\
  \ will come once they finish their dinner. He also requested me to look after the\
  \ kid until his wife returns.\n\nIt was midnight; I was extremely tired and had\
  \ an equally tired toddler to take care of.\n\nThe wife doesn\u2019t seem to return\
  \ for the next 30 minutes. I pulled the kid close to me and rested on the bed still\
  \ holding his hand. I have no idea when I fell asleep but when I woke up it was\
  \ 1.30 am and the kid was at the rim of the berth. I got panicked and picked him.\
  \ Amidst the sudden jerks of the bus I carefully placed him on my seat and got down\
  \ still wondering what meal they were having for such a long time.\n\nThe bus was\
  \ completely dark; with the help of my mobile screen\u2019s brightness I reached\
  \ the last berth and called them. As I didn\u2019t get any response I moved the\
  \ curtains, only to find them awake in a compromising position.\n\nShocked and embarrassed,\
  \ I swiftly moved and informed the driver & attender about the unattended kid. I\
  \ didn\u2019t tell anything about the \u2018dinner\u2019 because I really didn\u2019\
  t know how to put what I saw in words. The driver & attender didn\u2019t seem to\
  \ care, they simply asked me to go and sleep. I climbed back to the aisle side but\
  \ the unsettling thoughts didn\u2019t let me sleep. I had no idea why I did that,\
  \ but I checked the child\u2019s heartbeat to confirm that he is not dead. Thankfully\
  \ the kid was breathing.\n\nI have never spent so much time with a toddler before,\
  \ I was already sleep deprived and it was really uncomfortable. All my tries to\
  \ get some sleep ended in vain when the kid hugged me from back whispering \u2018\
  amma amma\u2019.\n\nShit, He mistook me for his mother. \n\nI felt pathetic for\
  \ that innocent kid. I tried pushing him away gently but he won\u2019t go. The entire\
  \ night he slept cuddling me, the entire night I was wide awake. The Bus reached\
  \ electronic city by 5 am, people started getting down but I couldn\u2019t see his\
  \ \u2018parents\u2019 until the bus reached Gaziabad. When the bus was about to\
  \ leave Gaziabad they rushed from the last berth and got down picking the kid.\n\
  \nThe kid who slept through the entire night started crying.\n\nThat is the longest\
  \ night I have experienced so far."
