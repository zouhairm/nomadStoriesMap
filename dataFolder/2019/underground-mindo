Text: "Rubble cracked beneath the tires. Passing through towns, crumbled concrete\
  \ fell scattered on the roads from the recent earthquake only adding to our increasingly\
  \ intense trip through the mountains. Escaping our earthquake relief work on Ecuador\u2019\
  s coast we headed toward the allegedly breathtaking cloud forest, Mindo. Pictures\
  \ of a valley and low hanging clouds slowly moving above a quaint village passed\
  \ through my mind, erasing the image of cities reduced to debris. The noise of luggage\
  \ shifting interrupted my thoughts just in time to look out at a sea of white as\
  \ we passed beneath the clouds into our own sanctuary. There\u2019s an ever-calming\
  \ feeling with a roof of clouds and a wall of green surrounding you. We approached\
  \ the town on roads made of dirt which turned to defined stones just as the green\
  \ bordering the road was replaced by worn concrete buildings. \n\nWalking from the\
  \ bus station (aka the side of the road) we saw locals sprawled across town, resting\
  \ on curbs, porches and seemingly anything they could find to lean against. Music\
  \ was blaring out of a nearby building as hands from a young group of locals began\
  \ to slip into ours, intrigued with our obvious recent arrival. As the dancing began,\
  \ our lack of hip-moving ability was a source for quite a bit of laughter. Knowing\
  \ I didn\u2019t have a rhythmic bone in my body I avoided taking any initiative\
  \ to join. Then I saw him, a smirk on his face, his dark eyes now locked to mine,\
  \ telling me to meet him on the make shift dance floor in the street. My partner\
  \ was quite the sight. At around 6 foot 4 with long ragged hair, he was unlike his\
  \ stocky, short-haired community. He enlightened me to the adventure he lived, working\
  \ at a local waterfall and fixing motorbikes. And then\u2026 \u201CDo you want to\
  \ learn to ride?\u201D In that moment, I couldn\u2019t think of anything better\
  \ to do with an almost perfect stranger. \n\nWaiting on the curb like a true local,\
  \ the hum of a powerful vehicle became clearer as he pulled right up to my toes.\
  \ I could feel the heat from the bike in addition to the hot sun beating down on\
  \ me. \u201CReady,\u201D he announced and off into the jungle we drove. After 30\
  \ minutes of winding about, we jolted to a stop and switched places. Without the\
  \ noise of the machine, a waterfall could be heard ahead, soon to be interrupted\
  \ by the sputtering of my hesitant starts. After a few attempts we were travelling\
  \ down the pothole riddled road. The beads in his hair clanged together as we raced\
  \ along without experience and with a huge language barrier. A 5-minute lesson was\
  \ enough, right? Feeling his heart racing in the back and the cool air as the sun\
  \ began to set, we decided it was time to head back, this time with him as the driver.\
  \ Imagine navigating the jungle at night\u2026 no thanks!\n\nClose to town, a tall\
  \ blonde, undoubtedly not from the area, approached us, catching me by surprise\
  \ with her familiarity to my guide and her fluency in Spanish. In clear English\
  \ she said, \u201CMeet us at the hole in the ground.\u201D Before I could inquire,\
  \ I was thrown back, forced to grip his jacket. We approached a hole in the ground\
  \ where the walls were soil and the roof made of tarp\u2026 a tent in the ground.\
  \ Putting all my trust in the tall, tanned man I followed him through an opening\
  \ and down a set of stairs carved out of the earth with cardboard as their surface.\
  \ Tons of people stood before us, speaking all sorts of languages. Heat was pouring\
  \ out of a large stone oven. An assembly line of pizza-making was in the works and\
  \ I had made it just in time to indulge. Everyone exchanged simple words in English,\
  \ and it didn\u2019t take long to learn that underground Mindo could bring people\
  \ together from across the world, especially when it involved pizza. After 6 hours\
  \ in a new city, I had new friends from around the world, a new swing to my dance\
  \ and a new adventure in my books."
