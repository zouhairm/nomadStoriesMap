Text: "I remember seeing him walking out from the airport\u2019s arrival section heading\
  \ towards us, his hand wrapped tightly around his mother\u2019s. He was smiling,\
  \ the kind of smile you have when you\u2019re excited to experience new things.\
  \ A new place. A new culture. His native-born mother went to hug mine, leaving him\
  \ dwarfed beside me. I knelt to meet his gaze; \u201CHi Benton. Are you excited\
  \ to be in Kenya?\u201D He nodded, \u201CWill I get to meet Simba?\u201D We burst\
  \ out laughing as we headed towards the car. \u201COnly if you promise to finish\
  \ your veggies.\u201D\n\nBenton would be spending a good 3 years with us as his\
  \ mother finished her studies back in Seattle. He knew little outside his usual\
  \ life of concrete jungles and greasy fast food, and pictured Africa as one vast\
  \ savanna grassland where mango trees were always in season and the locals freely\
  \ intermingled with wildlife. Now, he would have to acclimatize to his new surroundings,\
  \ learn how to relate with the people and cherish the one month he would have with\
  \ his mother before she left. But he didn\u2019t know all that.\n\nWe arrived at\
  \ our home in Nairobi, the capital city, where Benton would be spending his visit\
  \ with us, and after a few days of settling down decided to show him some of the\
  \ sites. A replica of the malls he\u2019d frequent in Seattle, the video games,\
  \ all while trying to ease the idea of him staying with us and show how the two\
  \ worlds really weren\u2019t all that different. And for a moment, everything seemed\
  \ to be going according to plan.\n\nBut the turning point came when we visited his\
  \ soon-to-be elementary school 2 weeks later. Restlessly sited in a small, plastic\
  \ blue chair in the corner of the headmistresses\u2019 office, watching the children\
  \ play outside as his mother conversed, he casually remarked; \u201CI can\u2019\
  t wait to get back home and tell my friends how Africa is just like the US\u2026\
  \u201D His mother looked back lovingly. It was time.\n\nWhenever we have a close\
  \ relative visiting after a long time away, it\u2019s become tradition to go to\
  \ our upcountry home a few days before their departure to both celebrate their arrival\
  \ as well as send them back with our blessings. So we decided to spend the last\
  \ week of my aunt\u2019s visit in Nyeri - a farmer\u2019s county covered in scenic\
  \ green hills, tea fields and livestock.\n\nBenton was downcast and understandably\
  \ so; his one-month vacation had turned into what seemed like an unwanted exile,\
  \ with what was before just a mere tourist\u2019s curiosity into our strange way\
  \ of life now turning out to be his way of life for the next 3 years. He dragged\
  \ his feet across the farm and wandered in solitude as we prepared a goat for our\
  \ guest of honor.\n\nGoat meat, especially roasted, is seen as a delicacy upcountry;\
  \ only reserved for the most special of occasions. A small crowd of relatives had\
  \ gathered to meet my aunt, and with them some neighborhood kids who would hover\
  \ around the roasting area. The aroma must have caught Benton's attention as well,\
  \ because he slowly began to hover closer to it. And once the meat was done, quickly\
  \ pounced and grabbed the first piece he saw. But the piece was so hot that he couldn\u2019\
  t keep it in for more than a few seconds, spitting it out with such speed that it\
  \ caused the other kids to burst out in laughter, resulting in them doing much of\
  \ the same. He smiled. A faint glimmer of the same smile he had back at the airport.\
  \ But a smile none the same."
