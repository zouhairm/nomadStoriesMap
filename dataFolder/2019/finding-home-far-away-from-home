Text: "The biggest goal of my 20\u2019s was traveling to 30 countries not including\
  \ Jamaica and the United States before turning 30. One of the hardest questions\
  \ to answer is: where is your favorite place that you\u2019ve traveled so far? I\u2019\
  ve seen many a cerulean water, I have many awe-inspiring sunsets seared into my\
  \ memory that I hope to still be able to recall in my senescence, paramount among\
  \ them thus far, the sunset atop Mount Haleakal\u0101 in Maui. Furthermore, as a\
  \ self-styled gastronome, I\u2019ve tasted some truly amazing dishes, the type of\
  \ flavor that you find yourself embarking on what proves to be a quixotic endeavor\
  \ and Sisyphean task, a search for a repeat experience. But for me, the most indelible\
  \ memories are often tied to the people that I\u2019ve met while traveling. \n\n\
  In June of 2014 I participated in a leadership program focused on diversity and\
  \ diplomacy. After the Washington D.C. leg of the program finished, we headed to\
  \ Paris, France. In the early days of our stint in France, the issue of race and\
  \ whether or not it was different than how race impacted society in America came\
  \ up and carried over to dinner. After dinner, I suggested that we needed to talk\
  \ to some black Parisians to find out how much of a role race played in French society,\
  \ and whether black Parisians and French denizens felt truly integrated as a part\
  \ of French society and whether or not it was an issue as much as it is in the United\
  \ States. On a whim, as our conversation spilled over into the street, I saw two\
  \ black Parisian women walking towards us, I got their attention and posed our question\
  \ to them. That chance encounter turned into a fascinating and protracted conversation.\
  \ Long story short, we hung out a few times over the subsequent two weeks, kept\
  \ in touch over the years, I\u2019ve been back to Paris to see them, and in 2016\
  \ I met up with one of them and her husband in New York; however, something that\
  \ I could not foresee on that torrid summer night in Paris, three years later after\
  \ watching flight alerts for two and half years, I found myself with my little brother\
  \ at their mother\u2019s house in La Gaulette, Mauritius. This trip to Mauritius\
  \ often comes to mind whenever I\u2019m asked about my favorite destinations. \n\
  \nI think being from Jamaica, has spoiled island/beach vacation experiences for\
  \ me, I usually go in expecting so much, but often find myself being underwhelmed\
  \ when I compare them to Jamaica. However, Mauritius was not consistent with the\
  \ usual experience, I\u2019ve never been somewhere so redolent of Jamaica from a\
  \ topological perspective, it was more or less a smaller facsimile of Jamaica in\
  \ this regard. There were times where I felt as if I was driving in Jamaica, La\
  \ Gaulette reminded me of my Grandmother\u2019s bucolic hamlet hometown of Duncans,\
  \ Trelawny. Driving through thoroughfares with sugar cane on both sides, brought\
  \ me back to the drive through Worthy Park on the way to my Grandparents\u2019 homestead\
  \ in Northern Clarendon, Jamaica. \n\nOne of my favorite things to do when in Jamaica\
  \ is hiking to one of the country\u2019s myriad waterfalls, Mauritius gave me this\
  \ experience as well, my friend Anne-Gaelle got a group of her friends and me and\
  \ my brother to hike to Eau Bleue, \u201CBlue Hole\u201D. We had so much fun, and\
  \ also got to witness a marvelous vista, where plain meets sea, again invoking memories\
  \ of Jamaica. And yes, Jamaica also has its own waterfall named Blue Hole. Unfortunately,\
  \ I probably won\u2019t return to Mauritius until 2021 or 2022, far too long, however,\
  \ the next time I go, I plan on wind surfing, immersing myself in an exploration\
  \ of the country\u2019s seggae (Mauritian version of reggae) scene and learning\
  \ more about the Mauritian Maroons. Jamaica also has a history of Maroon communities.\
  \ For me, it was poetic that reggae was named to UNESCO\u2019s World Cultural Heritage\
  \ List in Mauritius of all places this past November. My friends and their family\
  \ treated me and my brother like family, and Mauritius feels like home far away\
  \ from home. Maybe this is the essence of travel"
