Text: "He died with an impact right in the heart.\nI believe I also have died at that\
  \ moment, when I saw him fall and couldn't do anything. I lost my soul and all I\
  \ have left is this body that I didn't want to be here. They make me sit in a chair\
  \ and hear everyone talk about. Support group. They said it would be good for me.\n\
  I wanted to be dead.\nI close my eyes for a moment and I feel selfish. My mother\
  \ would be destroyed if I had died, but I can't get that craving comes out. The\
  \ images of his smile fading are like flashers in my mind. A light failure that\
  \ turns on and off, making me want to scream.\nHe had a beautiful smile.\nI think\
  \ in my last words to him. \"I'm going to go get a beer, don't move!\" \u2013 I\
  \ could have said so many things. I could have kissed his forehead and smiled; he\
  \ would have smiled back and at least I would still have it saved in my mind.\n\
  There's nothing left beyond the anguish of losing him.\nI'm rooting for anyone to\
  \ get me started. I didn't want to be here and don't want to be forced to start\
  \ crying again.\nI wanted to be dead not to feel this pain. Knew him enough to know\
  \ that if he were here he'd give me a slap and tell me to live. But I'm not him\
  \ and I can't handle it. I'm asking any higher power so I simply disappear.\nA month\
  \ and I still look in the mirror every morning and I guarantee that this will be\
  \ the last day: or the pain stop or I\u2019ll stop it.\nI cuddle whenever I see\
  \ my mother. She hugs me so she sees me. She thanks me for being alive.\nI can't\
  \ do that to her, that's why I'm here. I need to give my mother hoped that I am\
  \ improving even if the only thing that remains in me is the melancholy.\n-Bryan\
  \ - someone says my name, pulling me from my thoughts.\nThey want me to talk about\
  \ why I'm here, even though everyone already knows. I don't want to speak, but I\
  \ don't want to disappoint my mother. I'm sure you're going to tell her and she'll\
  \ think I'm sinking again.\nI need to swim to the surface even though I want to\
  \ drown.\n-When I close my eyes, I see him dying with so many people. I'd rather\
  \ be dead than have it playing in my mind all the time.\nI don't take anyone, but\
  \ I know that everybody's looking at me. Talking is just another poke in pain that\
  \ covers me like a cloak.\nI shoulders. I don't know if someone's mistake. I don't\
  \ care. I know they will move on to the next; they know I'm not going to say anything\
  \ today. We stayed silent in respect to my desire to die. All share this at some\
  \ point.\n-Why did you want to be dead? -She says to my side. Selena is a person\
  \ full of sadistic stories. She shouldn't be talking about, your time has passed.\n\
  I see she doesn't need my answers to continue.\n-A reason, isn't it? So, there you\
  \ go: If you die, they win \u2013 she is so clever that I want to strangle her.\
  \ -Bryan, don't let them take another life. His death means homophobia winning.\
  \ Don't die if I can avoid it.\nMelancholy smile. Ponder on what she just said and\
  \ she knows it.\nSelena raises, and all follow with your eyes. She serves coffee\
  \ and back to sit beside me.\n-Keep your eyes open \u2013 she comments.\nShe hits\
  \ the feet on the ground and looks like she\u2019s taking the dust of the soul.\
  \ Have tears in their eyes, because they glow more than normal, and I know that\
  \ she\u2019ll going to talk again.\nCath tape me and his words punch me, because\
  \ I know he would say the same thing.\n-Luchamos, resistimos!\nSigns of resistance,\
  \ he would say in a smile.\nWe fight.\nLuchamos.\nMy body gets who I didn't expect\
  \ to find: my soul."
