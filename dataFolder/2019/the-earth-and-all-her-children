Text: "\u201CThe Earth is angry\u201D, Indah declares as she lights the incense and\
  \ circles it around the bronze statue of Ganesha, the God of new beginnings. \u201C\
  And she will continue to destruct so long as she is mistreated.\u201D  \n\nIs this\
  \ woman for real? I turn to look at the young boy, but he is nodding his head at\
  \ her. He has just asked Indah, a server at The Elephant, what caused the earthquake\
  \ two weeks ago in next-door Lombok. \n\nI want to laugh and explain that when the\
  \ layer of rock underneath the surface breaks, it releases pent-up energy, causing\
  \ seismic waves to shake the ground and eventually break, but I keep my mouth shut\
  \ and simply roll my eyes. Hearing spiritual hogwash like this in Bali isn\u2019\
  t uncommon \u2013 the island is full of tourists, there to \u201Cfind themselves\u201D\
  \ as they do yoga and embrace Hinduism. In Indonesia, a predominantly Muslim nation,\
  \ Bali is one of the few places with a Hindu majority population. \n\nI\u2019m sitting\
  \ alone at a table for two at this quaint caf\xE9 overlooking the Campuhan trail\
  \ in Ubud. It has verdant ridges of either side of it. Today it is empty, amidst\
  \ the cloudy skies and rainy weather. It\u2019s my second time at this place in\
  \ the last week, and I\u2019ve come back for the unforgettable mango-dragon fruit\
  \ smoothie. But the power is out, and the blender will not work, so I wait. What\
  \ a waste of a day, I think, as I wallow in boredom. \n\nI escape my thoughts as\
  \ I hear the boy again, \u201CSo it\u2019s us? WE are the problem?\u201D Indah,\
  \ with her wavy black hair, dark complexion, and twinkling eyes that speak of a\
  \ gentle heart, looks at him. \n\n\u201CUntil we learn to enjoy life and its capacity\
  \ to offer us all we want without hurting others, we will continue to have earthquakes,\
  \ and tsunamis, and hurricanes\u201D. She turns to me with an all-knowingly. \u201C\
  For example, today you cannot have your smoothie without waiting for it. There are\
  \ times you must sacrifice something, and today, it is your time.\u201D\n\nIndah\u2019\
  s words sting a little. I think about the boy whom I have not seen in two months,\
  \ since the day he ended our three-year relationship. I recall something about the\
  \ lack of empathy I showed when he struggled, the lack of care for his pain. Now,\
  \ his name is a bitter memory in my mind. It has turned me angry and selfish. \n\
  \nHours later, Indah hands me my smoothie. She nods in approval as my eyes light\
  \ up in awe, of the way the bright pink dragon fruit chunks swirl into the thick\
  \ mix of mango and yogurt. I revel in the anticipation of the first sip. I lick\
  \ my lips - it tastes even better than I remember. \n\nBy the time I am done, I\
  \ have let go of the anger. Indah\u2019s words shadow over me, and instead, I marvel\
  \ in the beauty around me and all this island has to offer, from the waves crashing\
  \ against the cliffs of Uluwatu in the south, to the peak of Mount Batur in the\
  \ north. I watch as the skies clear, and the sun lends its warmth to the flora around\
  \ it. It radiates its energy, encompassing me in its positive light. \n\nIt is said\
  \ that when Ganesha was young, he picked up a cat and pulled its tail carelessly\
  \ as it meowed in pain. Upon reaching home, he found his mother, goddess Parvati,\
  \ lying on the floor, aching. She explained that we are all connected, that we embody\
  \ the Earth and all her children within us. By hurting the cat, Ganesha had hurt\
  \ his mother, thereby hurting himself. \n\nThe next day, there is another earthquake\
  \ in Lombok. It occurs deep into the night, when people are sound asleep. Until\
  \ now, I\u2019ve only thought about my pain, never wondering for a second about\
  \ the hurt I caused and why the boy I loved left, never wondering what caused the\
  \ layer of rock in the Earth to break.\n\nBut that night, I feel the beds tremble,\
  \ and this time, I feel for the Earth as she weeps."
