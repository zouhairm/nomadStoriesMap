Text: "I arrived in Zagreb on a sleepy mid-winter night, right after Christmas but\
  \ still in time to admire the beautiful decorations lighting the darkness with their\
  \ festive atmosphere. My accommodation was located beyond the river Sava, in a district\
  \ with too many consonants, and way too many unemployed crowding the smoky bars.\n\
  \nLiving in Zagreb for two months showed me that a European capital does not have\
  \ to be touristic to be interesting. In the beginning, I felt weird that the price\
  \ of products in supermarkets where rather more expansive than in Italy, with a\
  \ consistent difference between the average salaries of our countries. With time,\
  \ I learnt to love the cheap district markets where people are kind and proud to\
  \ sell local goods at affordable prices. With time, I learnt that part of the beauty\
  \ of the city lives in the colorful street art that decorates the gray buildings\
  \ of the Socialist era. With time, I discovered that inside the austerity of the\
  \ National Library building there is a world made of young people that every day\
  \ study how to build a better future. They have the same patient attitude of citizens\
  \ who wait for public transportation. They know that, even if busses and trams does\
  \ not always respect the timetable, they will pass by sooner or later. They just\
  \ have to wait.\n\nIn contrast to the appearance, Croatians are far to be passive\
  \ people: they love to have fun. Perhaps, this is why citizens warmly welcomed the\
  \ installation called \"The Grounded Sun and Nine Views\". The artist didn\u2019\
  t reveal where he put all the steel balls that compose that Solar System portrayal\
  \ and let them join the amusing search with just an information: every ball has\
  \ a proportional distance to the Sun.\n\nPrecisely in front of the Sun of Zagreb\
  \ I lived the most intense local connection of my Croatian stay. In the bar reflected\
  \ in the golden sphere, during that magic night, I found myself surrounded by the\
  \ rhythm of the slam poetry show named \u201CPamela\u201D, where my heart synchronized\
  \ with many other Croatian ones. Whenever one of them stood up to recite a poem,\
  \ a thrill shook my body more than the best rakija shot could ever do. Every pause\
  \ jostled between words like hope fights war, which is still fresh in many people\u2019\
  s memory. In those moments, the image of unemployed people who drown their sorrows\
  \ in alcohol became as flimsy as the smoke of their cigarettes. It was replaced\
  \ by all the good experiences I lived in Zagreb, like that afternoon in the ice-skating\
  \ park around the fountain in front of the train station, the movie night on the\
  \ comfortable armchairs of Kino Europa and the tasty \u201CSarma\u201D that my Croatian\
  \ flatmate once cooked for dinner. That night my thoughts flew to the upper town,\
  \ where an enchanted atmosphere hosts the Museum of Broken Relationships. I suddenly\
  \ realized how funny is for it to be born in the city that built on resilience its\
  \ way of life."
