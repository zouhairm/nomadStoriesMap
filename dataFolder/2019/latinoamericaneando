Text: "Latin America. Latin America. Notice how you can\u2019t say it without a little\
  \ move of the hips? A little roll of the \u201Cr\u201D? A lot of opening of the\
  \ \u201Ca\u201Ds? If you look it up on a map, Latin America takes over most of the\
  \ American continent, but it is much more than that. Latin America is a feeling\
  \ - a sort of heartbeat that resonates within all of the latinos, that moves us\
  \ together. \n\nI have been calling my photo essay \u201CLatinoamericaneando\u201D\
  , as in a verb, an action verb, a moving verb. Just as the land I am portraying,\
  \ my pictures and writings are always changing, always moving. In my travels around\
  \ the beautiful countries I have found that contradiction is what binds them together.\
  \ Each country is unique, but they all share the background, that same heartbeat.\
  \ It\u2019s impossible to separate them, even the each one is so particular. That\u2019\
  s how we, latinos, are. We vibe together, standing proud, representing our own country,\
  \ but loving our sisters and brothers from other latin countries. \n\nAs a Costa\
  \ Rican girl, it's easy for me to observe, to feel this similarities, for I identify\
  \ myself in the feeling of each country. I hope to continue this journey, searching\
  \ for more details, more stories, more love in the different personalities of my\
  \ own beautifully contradictory Latin America."
