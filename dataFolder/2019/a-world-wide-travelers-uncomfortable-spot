Text: "Can I still call it home if it doesn\u2019t feel like home anymore?\nWhat happens\
  \ when you go home after 5 years of traveling experiences?\n\nAfter what some would\
  \ call my \u201Cbig\u201D exit from my previous job, I headed over to New Zealand.\
  \ Yes - after I quit my job, I really did quickly book myself a flight and head\
  \ home to mama\u2019s house - after two and a half years of living abroad.\n\nIt\
  \ was that day when I arrived back home to boil ups and pies that I told everyone\
  \ that I was applying for a visa and going away for a longer time. No one was surprised.\
  \ I think my friends and fam are use to my get up and go unstable life anyway.\n\
  \nI scoffed down all the pies, delicious cheesecakes, hangis, hershy pies and great\
  \ KFC that I possibly could handle, and even dunked my head in the sea for some\
  \ fresh kaimoana. It was the best two months of amazing food I hadn\u2019t had in\
  \ ages. Food that I could relate too, food that I grew up on and food that made\
  \ me feel \u201Chome\u201D. But being back in New Zealand sometimes hasn\u2019t\
  \ given me the best of good feelings. It\u2019s a place that always brings back\
  \ memories - some that should only reminisced while being there. It\u2019s not that\
  \ I regret any of them - it\u2019s just where they\u2019ve had the biggest impact\
  \ on my life (besides Germany, haha). I loved connecting with family I hadn\u2019\
  t seen in years, seeing friends that I hadn\u2019t spoken to in a while, and opening\
  \ up closed doors that should have been reopened much earlier. But even with all\
  \ that, New Zealand does not feel like home anymore to me. This has been on my heart\
  \ for a while, but I think I\u2019ve felt ashamed to admit it. Home is a big concept.\
  \ It\u2019s the place I\u2019ve been bought up, the family I have cherished and\
  \ loved for years, the friends I have looked up to constantly and who have helped\
  \ guide me. So the question follows me: when is it really time to let go? When do\
  \ you finally reach the point of feeling so disconnected from everything and everyone?\
  \ I mean, leaving \u201Chome\u201D is not something that I\u2019ve ever wanted to\
  \ announce in a public way. But throughout my life, I have always tried to remain\
  \ as true to myself as possible. And that means staying true to the people who surround\
  \ me. It\u2019s not saying that I\u2019m going to let go of everything I was once\
  \ taught. It\u2019s not saying that I\u2019m going to let go of all the family bonds\
  \ I\u2019ve had since childhood. It\u2019s not that I\u2019m going to forget all\
  \ the amazing friends that I\u2019ve made. It\u2019s not that I\u2019m going to\
  \ leave all the memories behind. It\u2019s not that I\u2019m never going to return.\
  \ It\u2019s just that I\u2019m finally going to admit that I don\u2019t belong there\
  \ anymore. It\u2019s just that I\u2019m going to stop lying to myself about what\
  \ New Zealand means to me.\n\nIt will always be where I\u2019m from, but my world\
  \ is bigger now. It\u2019s just that I\u2019m going to let go now. Because I think\
  \ it\u2019s time.\n\nIt\u2019s time to stop calling it home."
