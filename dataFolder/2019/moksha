Text: 'Moksha into the wildness of Rishikesh a buzzing town on the river ganges. My
  trip started at 5 am on cold sultry morning where i had to go and join Bhagward
  gita classes to learn about Moksha.

  It did me a genreal good as my materlistic desire was taken care off by our guru
  along with the meamerising landscape of the Uttrakashi region of the holy ganga.
  The beauty being bliss by nature was soothing to 5 elements of our body which cant
  described by mere words.

  My whole lifestyle was changed longing for more productive use of my time in accordnace
  with the nature amd self realisation. New zeal for travel and learn was acquired
  in a day as we were blessed by the positive vibes of out surrounding. A acedmy which
  could do no harm to me in any aspect but yes make as a good human being by the lesseons
  of vedanta and the teaching of the sacred book Bhagward Gita.

  Being the yoga capital of the world it was buzzing with culture bought by by different
  people yet they were one of us being folloingbone Religion Humans. The water flowing
  the riverbeds and its ecosysteam were like nirvana where people could get lost in
  their slumber and reach the point of spirituality. The trip did change me as a human
  being as i wanted to explore more and more. It did educate me to understand humans
  as we ourselve are God we need to get Moksha from our life.'
