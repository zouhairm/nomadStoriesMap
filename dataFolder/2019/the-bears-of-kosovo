Text: "\u201CWe don\u2019t know what religion the bears follow,\u201D Kelsey counseled,\
  \ \u201Cmaybe they\u2019re open.\u201D We drifted around a dusty village looking\
  \ for \u201CThe Bear Sanctuary of Pristina,\u201D the most popular tourist attraction\
  \ in Kosovo\u2019s capital city\u2014according to the internet.  In truth, the complex\
  \ sits in the hills around Mramar, thirty minutes east of Pristina. But on the day\
  \ my travel partner, Kelsey, and I arrived, we suspected this mislabeling might\
  \ work to our advantage.\n\nEverything in Pristina proper was closed for Eid, a\
  \ Muslim holiday celebrating the end of Ramadan, but Christin Mramar carried on\
  \ as usual. The village exists as a Serbian enclave, drawn into Kosovo\u2019s disputed\
  \ borders eleven years ago. This distinction is made clear even to unknowing backpackers\
  \ like us by the Serbian flag waving in the traffic circle opposite the Serbian\
  \ Orthodox monastery. We understood almost nothing of the country\u2019s complexity\
  \ but figured if the bear keepers fell into Kosovo\u2019s Serb minority, they might\
  \ be open.\n\n\u201CDo you need a taxi?\u201D A young man called out as he headed\
  \ towards us.\n\nKelsey and I glanced at each other, we\u2019d been warned not to\
  \ accept rides from unofficial taxis in Kosovo. The area was a war zone within our\
  \ lifetimes and wasn\u2019t a recognized country until we were teenagers\u2014its\
  \ newness seemed to carry with it the potential for danger. The man sensed our unease\
  \ and pointed around the corner where two cars waited on the curb. \u201CI have\
  \ a taxi.\u201D\n\n\u201CYou know the Bear Sanctuary?\u201D I asked, already following\
  \ him.\n\n\u201CYes, tourists only come here for the bears.\u201D He held the door\
  \ open and we shimmied into his backseat, our concern repelled by a flaking taxi\
  \ sticker.\n\nAs we rode out of Mramar, I asked the young driver, Gezim, if he was\
  \ from the village. \u201CNo,\u201D he answered, \u201CPristina. I lived for ten\
  \ years in Montenegro.\u201D\n\n\u201CYou came back?\u201D\n\n\u201CMy family left\
  \ during the war.\u201D He looked at us through his rear-view window to check that\
  \ we knew there was a war. Kelsey and I both nodded, although I had only the vaguest\
  \ notion of the war\u2019s most basic facts. \u201CThen, I had no passport, so Montenegro\
  \ made me leave. I came back four years ago. My family is in Montenegro. Except\
  \ my daughter.\u201D\n\nI didn\u2019t know what the correct response, so I mumbled,\
  \ \u201COh.\u201D\n\n\u201CHow old are you?\u201D\n\n\u201CTwenty-six,\u201D Kelsey\
  \ answered.\n\n\u201CAh, I\u2019m twenty-five! A younger man.\u201D The rest of\
  \ the way Gezim curiously peppered us with questions: Children? Marriage? School?\
  \ Jobs? What did our houses look like? By the time we reach the sanctuary, I felt\
  \ like a spoiled child from aimlessly wealthy parents. I\u2019d never been touched\
  \ by war, been lost in geographical limbo by changing politics, or had my future\
  \ limited by the location of my birth\u2014Gezim had experienced all these injustices\
  \ because of his. It was like we\u2019d lived the same quarter century on separate\
  \ planets.\n\nKelsey and I hopped out at the sanctuary gates, a little subdued.\
  \ \u201CWait, my phone number,\u201D Gazim called out. \u201CWhen you finish, I\u2019\
  ll take you back.\u201D It sounded like his paternal instincts. We gratefully took\
  \ his number and headed towards the entry.\n\nWe hadn\u2019t noticed that we were\
  \ the sole visitors until a sign at the gate informed us in three languages and\
  \ two alphabets that the sanctuary was closed. It turned out, the bears were celebrating.\
  \ Kelsey hailed Gazim\u2019s back down the driveway and he reversed, cigarette in\
  \ hand.\n\n\u201CIt\u2019s closed.\u201D\n\n\u201CNo!\u201D He stored the cigarette\
  \ between his lips and shifted the car into park. \u201CFollow me.\u201D\n\nThe\
  \ three of us walked around the first gate and crouched under a second. I spotted\
  \ tall chain-link fences, but before we got close enough to see bears, a keeper\
  \ halted us in the pathway.\n\nI didn\u2019t understand the words, but I know Gazim\
  \ valiantly tried to convince the keeper to allow us inside. Eventually, he turned\
  \ to us, \u201CThere are cameras. We cannot go further.\u201D\n\nGazim drove us\
  \ back to Pristina and apologized for our wasted trip. \u201CPut my number in what\u2019\
  s ap. If you need help call me.\u201D \n\nWe waved goodbye and it struck me that\
  \ the bears would have been the waste."
