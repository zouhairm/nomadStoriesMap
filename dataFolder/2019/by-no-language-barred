Text: "A few years back I had decided to take a trip to Antarctica, a superlative\
  \ final frontier of sorts that had always fascinated me. One of my motivations was\
  \ that I would be able to take a break from the hustle and bustle of modern life\
  \ and reconnect with myself. However, I also made some very lasting interpersonal\
  \ connections along the way. During a transit period in Chile, while sitting on\
  \ a park square bench alone, a local gentleman stopped by and sat near me, and proceeded\
  \ to strike up a conversation in Spanish. Luckily, being a language lover and recalling\
  \ my high school background in Spanish, I was able to converse with him. Having\
  \ gotten lost once as a child in South America with no knowledge of Spanish, this\
  \ experience was truly a conquest of my own difficult past experience. We talked\
  \ about local life as well as my own origin and travel plans, shook hands, and cordially\
  \ bid each other farewell. Such is precisely the sort of truly memorable and immersive\
  \ experience one desires during one\u2019s travels. Being a published poet and a\
  \ shy individual who didn\u2019t socialize much, let alone in a language not my\
  \ mother tongue, making this real-time personal connection was immensely liberating.\
  \ Indeed such experiences are what make travel and indeed life itself worthwhile.\
  \ I would proceed to visit other lovely individuals locally and during my Antarctica\
  \ visit, returning home newly invigorated with new relationships, experiences, and\
  \ hopes of new destinations."
