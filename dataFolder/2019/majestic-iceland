Text: "I wanted a break, break from life, from relationships and all those materialistic\
  \ possessions that couldn't give me happiness. The best way to see a place is by\
  \ renting car with your friends isn't it ?  but I went out of my way and started\
  \ an unexpected solo journey where learning became an every day thing. From forgetting\
  \ card pin to dragging luggage from hostels to hotels  in snow was quite unique\
  \ as those steps made me feel nature and its beauty at the best. Time when you can\
  \ feel snow on your face and hear nothing but natural charming voice of birds takes\
  \ all your restlessness away and leaves you with peace. It changed me , those 5\
  \ days , I found myself. \nI believe in making connections and first foremost I\
  \ made ,was with the guy I met at the hostel. He had the night shift and as usual\
  \ i couldn't close my eyes on time. I remember talking to him about life while he\
  \ folds all the laundry and asks me what brought me here. no doubt , a drink would\
  \ be best that time but he brought a muffin and hugged me good night. Next day ,\
  \ he picked me up  for a dog walk , where I lost myself and found not only inner\
  \ peace but happiness after seeing those dogs playing around. \nThe next day I went\
  \ to see more of the city and thought to myself , it would be great to attend karaoke\
  \ and pamper myself with good dinner. There I met newly wed couple who were glowing\
  \ out of love for each other and husband \" dedicating \"brown eye girl \" to his\
  \ wife was something I couldn't stop myself from recording. \nThe week seemed to\
  \ be all about love and there was this valentine's day when I thought some French\
  \ food and rooftop would be best. I met two handsome guys from Washington sharing\
  \ their experience and how airbnb is a good option to stay in and invited me in\
  \ for a nice coffee, \nLast day I planned to go horse riding but blue lagoon was\
  \ addictive. I spent more then 5 hours there with an amazing under water massage.\
  \ The food at lava restaurant was well served and decoration was more than perfect.\
  \ \nI can't sum up without sharing northern lights experience , well unfortunately\
  \ I didn't see them Instead I felt the most beautiful feeling in this world when\
  \ standing just at the corner of arctic and telling myself , this is it. Life is\
  \ about finding happiness in small things and sharing those with others. \nSome\
  \ earl grey and chocolate cake was the only thing the bar could offer me at my request\
  \ which did fill me to make my way back to the hotel. \nI treated myself with cinnamon\
  \ roll and latte at Perlan making my way back to the airport. Before flying all\
  \ I could say to myself was \" you made memories\""
