Text: "As heroes go, she was an unlikely one. She strode through a group of onlookers\
  \ at the information kiosk in Shanghai's People's Park.\nThe staff there were trying\
  \ to help my husband, my brother, and our youngest child with my mother's crippled\
  \ wheelchair. A front wheel \nhad come completely off it during a leisurely afternoon\
  \ stroll. My brother, a temporary resident, backtracked a good six or seven blocks,\
  \ \nbut was unable to locate the hardware. No one had a good suggestion, other than\
  \ to put it temporarily back in place.\n\nThe woman spoke up. \"This not good qualicaty,\"\
  \ she pronounced. A tiny woman wearing the garb of an ayi, or domestic helper and\
  \ a\nimpossibly folded baseball cap, she nonetheless projected confidence and authority.\
  \ She went on to say that she knew where a chair  of much better 'qualicaty' could\
  \ be procured, and offered to take us there herself. The walk would not be long.\
  \ The staff looked dismayed, but had no better\nsuggestions. We had some reservations\
  \ about following someone we had just met, but with no other options, we set out\
  \ with great hope for this bastion \nof mobility.\n\n The walk could not have been\
  \ longer than six or eight blocks, but it seemed much shorter as she talked about\
  \ everything from production \nquality to the best parts of her city to how to remain\
  \ safe while touring. She mentioned, with a good deal of pride, that she had a son.\
  \ I\ndon't recall our party saying much at all, as we were thoroughly enjoying her\
  \ commentary. We were also praying that the wheel wouldn't\ncome off again. Before\
  \ we knew it, we were turning in at a pharmacy on Nanjing Road. Our confusion soon\
  \ gave way to relief as she led us to \na second floor showroom. Arrayed in front\
  \ of us was a relatively vast selection of wheelchairs and medical devices. The\
  \ sales staff was ecstatic. \nThey enthusiastically directed us to their finest\
  \ chair, and began extolling its virtues. Our new companion would have none of it.\
  \ She walked over \nto a simple, but sturdy, chair with cheerful plaid upholstery.\
  \ \"This good qualicaty,\" she informed us, ignoring the looks of annoyance and\
  \ dismay \nfrom the staff. They protested vehemently that this was not a suitable\
  \ chair. The ayi's recommendation, however, was enough for us. My mother\n happily\
  \ paid the very reasonable price, and we settled her into her new ride.\n\nSuddenly,\
  \ we realized that our savior had completed her mission. It was time to say goodbye.\
  \ Not wanting our time to end, we asked her if she \nwould like to have lunch with\
  \ us. She politely declined. We offered to compensate her in some way. She wouldn't\
  \ hear of it. Finally, my mother \nsaid, \"Could I at least have a picture  to remember\
  \ you by?\" At that, the ayi removed her cap and suddenly appeared many years younger.\
  \ She leaned in toward my mother and we were amazed to see the same smile on both\
  \ faces. Here, on the opposite side of the world, were just two moms\nwho had shared\
  \ a great adventure. \"My Chinese Angel,\" my mother breathed. \n\nWe never did\
  \ get her name. And my mother still has that wheelchair."
