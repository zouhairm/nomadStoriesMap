Text: "A heady concoction of eagerness, excitement and unease enveloped me as I lay\
  \ awake, afraid to be lulled to sleep and miss my much-anticipated 4.40 am flight\
  \ from Dabolim airport, Goa to Keflavik, Iceland.\nThe land of contrasting extremes,\
  \ of fire and ice, had mesmerised me for years and finally opportunity came a knocking\
  \ when I was invited to a month-long writers\u2019 residency at Laugarvatn, a quaint\
  \ village about 78 km from the world\u2019s northernmost capital, Reykjavik. The\
  \ 22-hour flight sapped my energy and initial plans to weave imagery about the unseen\
  \ topography, barren lava-rich terrain and extending snow sheets were soaked in\
  \ sleep, as I slumped on my seat wearily. As the taxi halted near a cottage that\
  \ snuggled in the shadow of the mountain, soft snow greeted me. For someone accustomed\
  \ to sunshine and tropical life, the cold snow brought unknown warmth. \nLike all\
  \ who visit Iceland, I wanted to see the Northern Lights, the amazing glaciers,\
  \ volcano sites, lava fields, hot springs, crystal clear streams, cascading waterfalls,\
  \ ice caves, the uniquely-gaited horses and go fishing, whale and puffin watching,\
  \ besides absorbing the culture that was so distinct and defined. Unfortunately,\
  \ the time was not right for the Northern Lights, as I realised that clear dark\
  \ skies were replaced by perennial daylight during May and the sun left the skies\
  \ for barely three hours, which meant I had to come back in winter, if I wanted\
  \ to be dazzled by the fascinating auroras. \nThe tranquillity of Laugarvatn, which\
  \ was the name of the village as well as the lake, was unlike any I experienced\
  \ before. Nestled in Anessysla region, between Thingviller, Skalholt and Gulfoss\
  \ within the Golden Circle, a popular tourist route, the quaint village was sheltered\
  \ in the shadow of Laugarvatnsfjall or the Laugarvatn mountains, with its stretching\
  \ birch-laden slopes. My alleviated lake-facing cottage, with a snowy mountain behind,\
  \ a camping site to its left and a little grocery store a further right, like several\
  \ cottages, barns and country homes, stood isolated in the barrenness of the extending\
  \ snow-clad region.\nIn spite of preconceived avowed writing schedule, overzealousness\
  \ lured me to explore and I soon found myself wrapped in layers and coats, sitting\
  \ near the edge of the lake, watching foraging birds near a little hot spring to\
  \ my left. A rather tall and well-built local told me about a place nearby, where\
  \ dead Vikings were cleaned of their battle wounds before the burial ritual. Also\
  \ entwined in the conversation was an interesting aspect of Icelandic ancient culture\
  \ where skins of dead friend or relative could be worn waist-down by a chosen person.\
  \ \nMy month-long visit was dotted with wonderful memories of Icelanders going out\
  \ of their way to help me.  Villagers also told me about various aspects of Icelandic\
  \ life and interesting tales about Laugarvatn, its hidden caves, unseen mountain\
  \ trails that led to isolated waterfalls, of their beloved lake and mysteries that\
  \ lay embedded in its shallowness. But no other story intrigued me as the tale about\
  \ the chest of gold on the flat-top mountain that I often watched from my cottage.\
  \ Not that I believed in the tale, but whenever the sun shone on its flat top, it\
  \ almost replicated a golden chest and nearly cast a spell, as if inviting.\nTwo\
  \ days later, I found myself scaling the flat-topped mountain and after difficulty,\
  \ determination and dizzy trails, I reached what looked like its top and was marvelled\
  \ by what I saw from its peak.\nThe serenity and singing birds lured me in a trance\
  \ and in that moment I found myself looking deeper into me. It was as if I had I\
  \ gained powers to peer within and soon my perspectives seemed altered. I sat, despite\
  \ the caressing cold and whining wind and looked at the ever-extending view of the\
  \ lake, houses, farms and smoke from warm springs that sparkled in mild sunlight.\
  \ \nIt was then, I suddenly realised, as if I had discovered the golden chest, and\
  \ it dawned that contents of the chest were never meant to be the shining metal\
  \ but enlightened knowledge that made me sparkle from within. Did Laugarvatn hold\
  \ a chest of gold? I\u2019ll never know!"
