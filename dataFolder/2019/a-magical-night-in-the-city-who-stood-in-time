Text: "Last year I discovered  Venice one of my favorite cities in the world where\
  \ I got to wear a XVIII century style costume for a masquerade ball. Upon my arrival\
  \ from the airport I was amazed by looking at the taxi that was going to take me\
  \ to my hotel. The beauty of the wheeless vehicle in a shape of a gondola was the\
  \ only transportation ever used by Venetians since the city was founded back during\
  \ the Roman Empire. My eyes couldn\u2019t bare the beauty of the old city who stood\
  \ in time. The old buildings looked like they were literally floating on top of\
  \ the ocean. The fog that covered the buildings gave them a sense of mystery wondering\
  \ how many stories those building would tell if they could talk.  \n The gondola\
  \ left me couple blocks from the hotel which therefore I had to walk couple blocks\
  \ to reach my hotel destination. The narrow cobblestone streets made it hard to\
  \ pedal my luggage but it was such an intense pleasure to be there that I didn\u2019\
  t mind if would take me ages to get to the hotel since I was enjoying every bit\
  \ of the beauty of the city who stood in time. \n  The many small cafes and shops\
  \ felt like I was going to be part those old fairy tales that my mother told when\
  \ I was a kid. It was Carnaval Season and it was existing to see people wearing\
  \ beautiful costumes while I was carry my luggage that by the time I arrived to\
  \ my hotel has one wheel left. I didn\u2019t have much time to appreciate the hotel\
  \ because I only had  few hours left to attend to the masquerade ball. As soon as\
  \ I arrived to my hotel room, I had to get ready for the ball. I got out from my\
  \ luggage the XVIII century costume,  powered my wig and got ready as soon as I\
  \ could  because the masquerade was about to start in an hour. I put my hat that\u2019\
  s decorated with feathers and rush through the hotel exit to walked throughout the\
  \ cobblestone narrow streets in a humid day. \nI took me sometime to get to the\
  \ ball because Venice it is full of many similar narrow streets and end street that\
  \ won\u2019t take you anywhere  therefore if you don\u2019t have a good map or used\
  \ your cell GPS phone you might get lost. \n  After thirty minutes I finally arrived\
  \ to the ball just in time. The entrance that would take me ball was hiding between\
  \ a small narrow street.          Upon my arrival was a person greeting the guest\
  \ dressed in a very typical Venetian costume with the very typical little intimidated\
  \ Venetian mask. \nThe ball took place at the \u201CPisani  Moretta Palace\u201D\
  \ which dates back from the XV century and since then has been the host of many\
  \ luxuries and decadent balls. Tonight was no exception., upon my arrival to the\
  \ main floor it was like I traveled back in time in the glorious days of the XVIII\
  \ century style masquerade balls. The live classical music really inspired me and\
  \ felt like it was no longer in the XXI century.  What I noticed a lot it is how\
  \ people\u2019s behavior and manors changes when they dress in a period costume.\
  \ It is like the period costume automatically changes the way you think and speak.\
  \ It is like the period costume has its own power to transport you to that specific\
  \ era. \nAfter enjoying the appetizers and an a Prosecco glass, a jester came to\
  \ invited us and escorted us to the main hall, up in the second floor of the palace\
  \ to enjoy dinner and amused us with entertainment as live classical music, the\
  \ jesters and the opera repertoire. \nI was without words to describe the beauty\
  \ of the main hall that was decorated using original XVIII style furniture and lighted\
  \ only with hundred of candles. After enjoying the tasting menu and the entertainment.\
  \ We  were escort to go back to the first floor to take lessons of the minuet an\
  \ XVIII century style dance  and enjoyed the few hours that we got left during this\
  \ magical night. As everything that begins has and end, I was sad that the ball\
  \ was over but exited to know that my first night at the city who stood in time\
  \ was magical and will be in my favorite memories for the rest of my life."
