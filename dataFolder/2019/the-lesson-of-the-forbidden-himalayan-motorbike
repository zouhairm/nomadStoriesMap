Text: "\"You have to put your foot up there, on the bar,\" Dilay said, trying to hide\
  \ his smile. \"He's a good guy. Don't worry.\"\n\nI'd known Dilay for 7 hours. I'd\
  \ been in Nepal for 70. I grew up with a mother that encouraged rappelling and ziplining,\
  \ caving and horse racing, skiing and camping, but always a stern \"never\" to a\
  \ motorcycle. My host agency forbid it. Yet I was sitting on the back of that motorbike,\
  \ trying not to grip the stranger in front of me, looking up a dusty, pot-holed\
  \ track that lead out of the chaotic bus \"station\" and into the mountains of my\
  \ host family. Dilay got a nervous nod from my helmetless head, and then his friend\
  \ and I were off.\n\nI was ostensibly in Nepal for all the acceptable reasons to\
  \ the people that couldn't conceive of me going on this trip. As an eager volunteer\
  \ I would say, \"I'll be helping women and children with a socially conscious grassroots\
  \ organization\" and people back home would nod their heads and commend me for my\
  \ efforts. I kept my other reason more tightly bound and hidden; I was having an\
  \ early mid-life crisis. Fifteen years in the mental health field had sucked the\
  \ life out of me and then handed me a numb cynic. With a loss of purpose in all\
  \ the predictable ways, I did something so cliched and yet still so vulnerably genuine:\
  \ I went to find myself. In Nepal. \n\nNow I was faced with a new story of myself:\
  \ that I was an ignorant fool who wasn't even sure if toilet paper should be put\
  \ in the trash or down the drain. I could not figure where to take my shoes off\
  \ and where to keep them on. The mechanism that turned on my host family's rare\
  \ hot water shower remained a mystery. Most all of all, I didn't understand those\
  \ naughty little buses, overflowing with people and running whenever and wherever\
  \ they please. But it was time for me to face them and find my own ride from the\
  \ chaos of the capital back to my host family. \n\nEnter Dilay. Juggling college\
  \ and full-time translator volunteering, Dilay was shy with his thoughts but a wealth\
  \ of knowledge. I liked my new partner, one of those gut check moments you have\
  \ that you simply trust. He recognized me as an anxious rookie. He helped me get\
  \ on my first Nepali bus, telling me with a laugh that the bus will teach me how\
  \ to dance. We jiggled along to the loosely termed station where numberless buses\
  \ rested at every angle. Dilay stood for an hour, refusing to leave me to the curious\
  \ taxi men as he haggled with drivers that refused my route. Then he found a friend,\
  \ heading my way, on the agency forbidden bike. \n\n\"He's my friend. You can trust\
  \ him. And I'll see you tomorrow.\"\n\nIt was not polite to hold on tight to a man\
  \ in this culture so I clung to the seat underneath me, sure I would tumble off\
  \ the back and probably the cliff entirely. Knowing my fear, the young man crept\
  \ along at the rate of a light jog, barely able to power up out of the road craters.\
  \ The wind kept us from talking but it also blew away the city smog. We climbed\
  \ up the mountainside through new mud and I realized I wasn't going to fall off\
  \ the back. My driver was not veering off the known road for some misadventure.\
  \ I was riding on the back of my first motorcycle, skirting a national park in Nepal,\
  \ the clean, chill wind blow my hair back in what I was suddenly sure was the picture\
  \ of elegance. It clicked then. I would be fine. I'd made a friend who helped me\
  \ out. This other young man was one of the world's good people and I was watching\
  \ the Himalayas unfold at a very agreeable pace. \n\nI remembered one of the lessons\
  \ I came so far to find. When you change, when you try something new, it's so very\
  \ scary. But after the fear comes the ecstasy of being so very alive."
