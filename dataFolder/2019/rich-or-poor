Text: This was the first time I was stepping outside of my country. I was traveling
  alone for the first time to an unknown place where I would be received by my family.
  Living a normal, middle class life back in India, Dubai was very fancy and flashy
  for me at a first glance. Expensive cars, huge skyscrapers, and costly living. It
  was very new and interesting to me. The country was very different from ours. It
  all looked dry and pale. Very less greenery but the flashy lifestyle was somehow
  overcoming that too. Everyone there had a real fast life and ambitious dreams to
  fulfill. But the other side of the country was just the opposite. People were suffering.
  People were dying too. There was hunger. There was sadness. In these parts, people
  had a very low living or medium. They didn't have that flashy rich life. I was really
  amazed and shocked seeing this at the same time. It is really very different to
  feel that. When enter downtown it all changes radically. All the buildings shortened,
  all the cars cheap and people wearing normal cheap clothes. A country having such
  a wide difference is really amazing. Even it was great to see the history and the
  rulers of UAE. How great, famous and religious they are. Maintaing the rule and
  prosperity of the country is a must. Everyone, from rich to poor abides the ruler.
  Life can really change here. This trip has given me a very big overview of this
  world and a gateway to future trips.
