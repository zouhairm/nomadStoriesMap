Text: "My story  is no just  about dreams, but about life. Cause life is a journey,\
  \ we decide to live like a nomad  or  in a plane above the sky.\n \nLast year I\
  \ was in Guatemala, doing a mission trip, when i recieved  a call from M\xE9xico\
  \ (where i am from)... my grandma was  diagnosed  with a liver  disease in final\
  \ stage. I remembered  every time that the both of us  played as if we were  traveling\
  \ around the world, while she thaught  me about history  and global  culture, laughing\
  \  and using our imagination. She said  to  me \"prom\xE9teme  que no s\xF3lo te\
  \ quedar\xE1s  con la vivida  imaginaci\xF3n, sino que viajar\xE1s a todos lados\
  \ y me llevar\xE1s en tu coraz\xF3n\"- promise me that you will not just stay with\
  \ the stories that we imagine, but  that  you are gonna travel and take  me in your\
  \ Heart. \n\nMy grandma  died  two months ago, i have a promise that i've made and\
  \ i want  to accomplish my grandmas' desire.\n\nI know that maybe  my story is not\
  \ funny  ir deep, but it is real, and written  from my deepest  and pure heart"
