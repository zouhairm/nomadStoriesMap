Text: "When the forces of nature resolve to manifest, all men can see and feel. This\
  \ was what happened in the early hours of Saturday, February 27, 2010.\_ The sea\
  \ lull was shaken by a crash, the earth moved hard, 59 kilometers deep.\n\nWhen\
  \ I received this news, a strong call took me from Brazil to help the people of\
  \ Calleta Tubul, south of Chile. It was a journey of surrender, I took my wife and\
  \ my 5 years daughter, and that changed our lives forever.\n\nOn that journey, I\
  \ ended up taking my camera and producing the documentary \"Viento Fuerte\" (Strong\
  \ Wind), about the recontruction of this city in Chile, which began with the Brisas\
  \ del Mar School. What looked like a distant dream was beginning to take shape.\
  \ The strong wind calmed down and the project to rebuild the Brisas del Mar school\
  \ in Tubul, left the paper, thanks to the work of people, who joined forces in \"\
  Operation Vento Forte\". Children, residents, students, teachers, all were doing\
  \ their best to meet a daring deadline; plan, design and execute the construction\
  \ of a modular school in just 1 month.\n\nThe wishes and hopes of the children,\
  \ teachers and mothers of Tubul Cove materialized. On April 25, 2010, the school\
  \ \"Brisas Del Mar\" was re-inaugurated. It was a day of celebration, of joy. The\
  \ eyes of each child reflected a sense of mission accomplished, a deep thankfulness\
  \ to all those who participated in this magnificent event that transcended the physical\
  \ aspects of the building itself, generating an atmosphere of love and satisfaction,\
  \ something sublime, that left a profound mark on the lives of each of the people\
  \ present."
