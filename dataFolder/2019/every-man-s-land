Text: "The safest bet for an inexperienced, lone woman traveller in India is the south\
  \ of the subcontinent. Having visited the luscious tea plantations in Munnar in\
  \ Kerala and the beautiful ruins of Hampi in Karnataka, the next must-see location\
  \ I chanced upon was Pondicherry. \n\nA tiny fishing village in India, Pondicherry\
  \ transformed into a port city after having hosted the French, Portuguese, Dutch,\
  \ Danes and the English. The French stayed the longest and it shows with statutes\
  \ of Francois Dupleix and Joan of Arc standing tall as one strolls on the promenade\
  \ located in White Town. My lean budget allowed for accomodation in the Indian quarter,\
  \ a part of town mainly occupied by the locals. It almost felt like two culturally\
  \ different towns. The French quarter housed a handful of heritage homes and structures,\
  \ with clean and distinctly french colours and architecture. The Indian quarter\
  \ had the smells and sounds of southern but a modern India with malls and cafes\
  \ generously sprinkled amid residential buildings catering to the consumer of today.\
  \ I was happy to cup my palms around a well-used and slightly chipped container\
  \ of hot filter coffee in one of India's oldest establishments across the country,\
  \ the Indian Coffee House after lunching and lounging at one of Pondicherry's heritage\
  \ boutique hotels, Hidesign. The duality and diversity of this city could not be\
  \ more extreme...not even by design.\n\nTrue to the meaning of its original name\
  \ - Puducheri meaning 'new settlement', the town is also home to a new and unique\
  \ way of life for settlers in Auroville, a village founded and formed in the north\
  \ of the city. The focal point of Auroville, an experiment in humanity is the Matrimandir.\
  \ This structure on first sight resembled a golden golf ball, a vision of grandeur\
  \ on the outside. The trip inside was a lot different. A calming and serene lotus\
  \ pond had been constructed at the seat of the Matrimandir; the walls on entering\
  \ the compound were chrome coloured bricks that gradually prepared the visitor for\
  \ what was to come. We were asked to leave our footwear and our voices outside before\
  \ entering inside. Once in each of us were given a pair of socks before we began\
  \ the ascent up a spiralled staircase leading to the centre of the structure. The\
  \ gold on the outside had gradually faded and on the inside all I saw and felt was\
  \ purity and peace of white marble. We assembled at the centre and sat down to meditate\
  \ for a few minutes before we left. Visitors could also step out near the pond to\
  \ dip their feet or simply reflect. This was clearly the Mother's vision, the founder\
  \ of Auroville and she had managed to get people in the 21st century to pause and\
  \ reflect on the brevity of their lives in a land that belonged to no one in particular.\n\
  \nPondicherry truly showed itself as every man's land in my soul-searching sojourn\
  \ through southern India."
