Text: "Wrapped in my New Zealand wool and waterproof jackets, shaking not from the\
  \ -8 degree weather, but the anticipation for what lay ahead, I found myself stepping\
  \ off the snow covered dock and onto the boat, ready as I\u2019d ever been to see\
  \ a whale. It was a last minute decision made on the rumours of a humpback whale\
  \ feeding just out of the harbour. An unusual time for the large mammals to be so\
  \ far north, but just what I needed to hand over the last of my money and jump aboard!\n\
  We took off from the port in Reykjavik, Iceland, with the wind at our backs and\
  \ snow in our faces as I made my way up to the lookout deck, eager to see anything\
  \ I hadn\u2019t seen before. The scenery was breathtaking; dark grey water churning\
  \ out of our way as we sailed out farther, seabirds swooping and circling in their\
  \ attempts to catch lunch, snow covered mountains leading up to the sky, disappearing\
  \ into the thick white clouds like something out of a Disney film. \nWith my breath\
  \ in my throat I couldn\u2019t tear my eyes from the view as it changed in front\
  \ of me. My hands were numb from holding my camera and I couldn\u2019t feel my feet-\
  \ in an optimistic attempt to get dressed, I had only put on one pair of socks-\
  \ but I was too much in awe of where I was to retreat to the warmth of the cabins.\
  \ \nThe snow fell in thick flurries, more than I had ever seen before. It clung\
  \ to my hair where it landed, the wind blowing it into my eyes as the hours passed\
  \ us by, still no sign of the whale. I closed my eyes for a moment, breathing in\
  \ the smell of the ocean and the purity of the cold air, all my anxieties and troubles\
  \ put on ice as the boat chugged on, a steady rhythm beating from the world around\
  \ me and into my heart. Even if no whale was sighted, I wouldn\u2019t change this\
  \ day for anything. \nIt had really begun to seem that way, too, as we rounded up\
  \ to our third hour on the hunt with still no sign of the humpback we\u2019d hoped\
  \ for. It made me jump when the crackle came over the loudspeaker, the captain telling\
  \ us another whale watching boat had sighted the humpback. We raced off in the opposite\
  \ direction, and if I had been clever about it I would\u2019ve used that time to\
  \ warm up inside as we made our way over, slicing through the waves like a thin\
  \ edged blade. My ambition to be the first to spot the whale overcame all logic,\
  \ however, and I made my way to the bow with a determined spring in my step. The\
  \ wind whipped my hair about and a painful combination of snow and sleet flew into\
  \ my eyes, but we made it! Up in front of us, to a backdrop of snow-covered mountains,\
  \ was the humpback whale I longed to see. He let us get close as he came up to breathe,\
  \ the puff of his blow erupting into the air like the geysers back on land. His\
  \ back rose from the surface, showing off the hump from his namesake, and a flash\
  \ of envy passed through me- to have a thick layer of blubber to survive this weather!\
  \ He flicked his tail in perfect arcs, water streaming off like rain in a gutter.\
  \ With gloveless numb fingers I took a photo, then another, and another. I was hypnotised\
  \ by his beauty, inspired to think of how large creatures can become and how insignificant\
  \ I was to him, yet home much he meant to me. \nHe left us after half an hour, diving\
  \ down deeper than I could imagine. It was sad to watch him go, and while I was\
  \ warmed by the sight of him, I new it was for the best that I was herded back inside\
  \ to a seat where I could slump down on and regain feeling in my toes. \nI didn\u2019\
  t think I\u2019d see a whale in January, but yet again Iceland had something gorgeous\
  \ to surprise me with."
