Text: "I never expect to put Iceland into my travel bucket list, I was there on July\
  \ 2018, experiencing and watching a beautiful green landscape of real nature to\
  \ proved in front of me. \n\nI do a walk journey to Iceland, I didn't take any rental\
  \ vehicle to shift me from one place to another, I just walk away straight from\
  \ Keflavik domestic airport to the main road with a big dreams to complete the ring\
  \ road by walking, even in a summer month, the weather was so cold and breezy, the\
  \ wind are too strong flowing from the upper hills, and it make my steps slower\
  \ on this land, I felt like I'm in a earth heaven, everywhere on this land was crafted\
  \ beautifully by god. \n\nWalking or wayfarer one of the new thing I want to do\
  \ for my travel initiatives, to see a real view with a rigid slow motion. If I travelling\
  \ by car, I can't see a crisp details of the place itself, that's why I choose to\
  \ be a wayfarer until now. People are really nice here, do offer help to send me\
  \ off to the next town, but I refused not too, sometime, cause I think, I still\
  \ can walk even the strong wind make my move slower, I frequently stops, to let\
  \ my brain captured a small things in my mind, I don't feel tired, walk kilometers\
  \ away, good enough, I do have enough water to drink, foods to eat. Night just for\
  \ one hour, mostly daylight, It was amazing and incredible, I never experience this\
  \ before.\n\nEarly days was fine and happy, I never prepare much enough for this\
  \ journey, so, end up, I only spend few days on the road, like what I expected,\
  \ I run out of cash, food, and feeling tired drastically. I talked to myself many\
  \ times, should I continue this journey, should I?, I call my friend, I said to\
  \ him, I want to stop this journey, I couldn't take it anymore, I felt so tired,\
  \ cause I don't have a proper place to sleep, mostly I slept somewhere behind the\
  \ shop, petrol station. I decided to walk back to Keflavik domestic airport, and\
  \ it ends now. \n\nBecause of I ran out of cash, I did not take a bath for many\
  \ days, not even once, I smell really bad and awful, I covered my body with layer\
  \ of t-shirts, and my hair started to fall. I stayed at the airport for many days,\
  \ until the last 3 days before departure, the airport security notice my presence\
  \ quite too long inside the airport terminal, they chase me away from the airport,\
  \ and told me to find a place to stay. I tried to find free accommodation by couchsurfing\
  \ app, maybe someone could let me in to stay for few days upon my departure soon,\
  \ because I am not using this app before, no reference, It was really hard to get\
  \ reply from surfers immediately. So, I decided to ask my friend to deposit sum\
  \ of cash for me to buy a flight ticket to London where I left half of my stuffs.\
  \ \n\nI love Iceland, but I'm not well prepare for these journey. By the way, it\
  \ was so exciting to discover a new place by myself, even in a short days. I cried,\
  \ I talked with myself, that life is so beautiful, the process might be difficult\
  \ and challenging, but it worth it. One day, I will coming back to this land with\
  \ the same vision, to complete the golden circle walk. - Saiful"
