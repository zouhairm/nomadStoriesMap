Text: "Twenty years ago \u2013 when I was 16 years old \u2013 I made a tough decision:\
  \ Without knowing a word of Spanish, I spent my high school year in a tiny and unknown\
  \ country with the strange name \xB4Uruguay\xB4. While personally desiring go to\
  \ Argentina, I was first disappointed when I found out about my final destination,\
  \ a country I have never heard before \u2013 except that it was the first winner\
  \ of the world cup in 1930. During my exchange year, I instantly felt in love with\
  \ this magic and peaceful country, with its charming and natural people and culture.\
  \ Therefore, I kept in touch with my \xB4second home\xB4 until today, trying to\
  \ \xB4come back home\xB4 every three years. Talking about this country make my eyes\
  \ sparkle. Others get attached with my passion and are excited to explore Uruguay\
  \ on their own.\n\nIn 2018, Uruguay was promoted by Lonely Planet as one of the\
  \ top ten destinations. Reading this made me happy, because this country is a pearl\
  \ and merits to be discovered. I\u2019m glad, if more people get the chance to enjoy\
  \ great landscapes, fresh air with eucaliptus flavour playing softly with your skin,\
  \ the liberty you can feel almost everywhere, the diversity of rough beaches with\
  \ hippie-colonies, sea lions, wander dunes and stunning sunsets, the life in the\
  \ countryside on an \u201Eestancia\u201C with gauchos and wild horses in an endless\
  \ Pampa, the delicious beef and barbecue culture or the intense \xB4mate tea\xB4\
  .\n\nIn those points, Uruguay has not changed: The \u201Agood things\u2018 are still\
  \ the same \u2013 and this is what I appreciate about this somehow conservative\
  \ country. However, things always change \u2013 and this is what growing tourism\
  \ does, too! Uruguay is a good example: A few years ago, around 2006, a big ecoturism\
  \ campaign, called \xB4Uruguay natural\xB4, was started by the government, respecting\
  \ the mix of the unbelievable beauty of Uruguay\xB4s landscape as well as its open\
  \ and warm people! Over the time, I got to know more people who visited Uruguay\
  \ and were fascinated by its eco-tourism. Tourism in Uruguay in general developed\
  \ more and more and some places like the old historical part of Montevideo were\
  \ remodeled with new fassades \u2013 and at the same time gentrificated: A \xB4\
  new\xB4 place for nightlife and new museums were born and the place itself became\
  \ more secure.\n\nNow, in february 2019, things in Uruguay have obviously changed,\
  \ tourism booms and I am witnessing the following: I am not the only German girl\
  \ anymore walking around, typical touristic stuff as walking tours like in Europe\
  \ are offered as well as new and pricy hipster restaurants similar to Berlin have\
  \ been established, fancy facebook pages about Uruguay have been created and huge\
  \ cruises are dominating the port of Montevideo. Tourism contributes strongly to\
  \ the development of a country and should therefore promote its\xB4 attractions.\
  \ That is why I appreciate the `push` of tourism to the capital and the country.\
  \ The eco-campaign was a really good start, but maybe it has turned to fast into\
  \ a tourism boom which often results in a loss of charme and authenticity of a place.\
  \ This is the critical part: I do not want to lose `my` charming old town of Montevideo\
  \ with its morbide ruines. I do not want to lose my feeling of being in a fairy\
  \ tale of the 18th century \u2013 but this is what Montevideo until nowadays felt\
  \ like. I do not want to lose my secret holiday recommendation although I am promoting\
  \ Uruguay by myself. I love travelling and discovering hidden places. By sharing\
  \ those recommendations, over the time no country would be the same as before. This\
  \ is what happened now. However, in my opinion, a travel writer should always focus\
  \ in his or her writings on eco-tourism which at the same time integrates local\
  \ communities trying to maintain the charme and authenticity of a place.\n\nMy experience\
  \ in Uruguay was a leap into the unknown, over 20 years I was lucky to make local\
  \ connections. Therefore, I thought I know the country and its people. What I really\
  \ did not expect to find this time is the fact that the conservative country \u2013\
  \ due to growing tourism \u2013 is somehow changing \u2013 until its society."
