Text: "As in Spain practically all the cultures trod Portuguese lands throughout history.\n\
  \nCeltic Romans Visigoth Christians and Muslims formed a crucible that gave rise\
  \ to what is now the Portuguese country.\nIn Vila Nova de Foz Coa can be seen engraved\
  \ in stone from 2000 years ago or megaliths on the outskirts of \xC9vora.\n\nThe\
  \ centuries and centuries of history of Portugal make many of its corners UNESCO\
  \ World Heritage.\nMany are the incredible sites to visit among forests, castles,\
  \ palaces or their small inland villages that still retain that medieval air.\n\n\
  The beauty of many places in Portugal, whether in the Peneda-Ger\xEAs National Park\
  \ or in the historic villages of Beiras is sometimes unequaled.\n\nAnother of the\
  \ charms of Portugal are its beaches, and outside the most tourist beaches, we have\
  \ at our reach 800 km of calm dune beaches in islands surrounded by crystal clear\
  \ waters, incredible cliffs or beaches of wild waves to surf.\nPortuguese cuisine\
  \ is never better said apart dish, simple dishes and surprising flavors.\nA whole\
  \ world to discover washed down with olives, red wine, cheeses, bread freshly baked\
  \ and of course, fish and seafood.\nAlthough we do travel from Spain we will not\
  \ have any problem in taste and appreciate correctly all the gastronomy that the\
  \ neighboring country offers us.\nPortugal is a place to visit and welcomes anyone\
  \ who wants to meet you.\nAnd as it could not be otherwise from our academy we fervently\
  \ encourage you to know this wonderful country."
