Text: "I didn't expect to find an opportunity for which I dreamed of to have a sea\
  \ trip on a cruise might be because I belong to a middle class family which hardly\
  \ meets their living expenses. so the dream to have a trip of ship around the world\
  \ is like a myth and I always discovered the beauty of the sea, sunshine reflection\
  \ in water, the pressure of air, the water humps and the fear of night when the\
  \ direction is undefined for a common man towards the destination. life of sea travellers\
  \ are so much change from the life which we used to know. they don't get up that\
  \ they are late for office or their children are getting late for school but they\
  \ get up to feel and notice the new world. people faced different era of socialism,\
  \ capitalism, comunism and now consumerism and quite happy to buy a new car or home\
  \ but have never understood the beauty of life. I would rather say that they never\
  \ lived, they don't want to live and those who wants to live confronts with bread\
  \ and butter. \nsimply life is as the way you try to find it out. I always believed\
  \ that there is a concept of luck and the formula to me for luck is a bit different\
  \ I.e. hard work - skills. so I always dreamed to have a voyage and my dream would\
  \ be accomplished by not doing so by myself so I never stopped dreaming. I never\
  \ expect to find a sea trip while looking at my resources but the urge and dream\
  \ neither stopped nor I did anything to stop it rather I always looking for a chance\
  \ to stand at the front deck and feel myself on a complete different plannet. noting\
  \ down every single movement and recording my voice as I m creating a history and\
  \ people gonna discover it after years so by reading and listening they can discover\
  \ that a new world like heaven exists in this plannet and they are still unaware\
  \ to it. after that people leave everything behind and they just have a gole in\
  \ life that they don't want to be suck-sex-ful(succesful) rather they wants to live\
  \ and by my eyes they see that u not only live once but actually u live in every\
  \ single second, u merely die once."
