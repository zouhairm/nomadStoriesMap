Text: "The world is a very round (and flat) place and every place... has something\
  \ special to offer.\n\nTraveling is one of the most interesting and rewarding things\
  \ in life. You can learn different things about other cultures and put your own\
  \ culture into a new perspective. The landscapes, the weather, the foods, the customs,\
  \ the festivities... everything changes when you travel abroad!\nThe life of a nomad\
  \ is based on constant adaptation to changes. Everything changes with the pass of\
  \ time. \nI come from a place where many European immigrants settled, mixed with\
  \ Indigenous people, and built a new nation. \nA place where most people speak Spanish\
  \ and are very open to foreigners, happy people (and funny people too). \nA place\
  \ where the \"arepas\" are our main dish, and where big mountains can be seen at\
  \ first glance.\n\nA place of brave and hardworking people that values friendship,\
  \ diversity, and freedom. \nThat place is also known as the \"Little Venice of South\
  \ America\", a place with an Italian-styled name... Venezuela.\nIn this little,\
  \ tiny-sized country you can find a vast nature and uncountable natural resources\
  \ such as oil, water, gold, and many more!\nIt is a place of a rich story, hard\
  \ battles, and a multicultural society. We have a little bit of everything around\
  \ here.\n\nI consider the USA my second home, because is where half of my family\
  \ lives.\nDuring my recent visit to the \"land of the brave and the free\", I could\
  \ experience and note the following aspects:\n- Americans are (in general) friendly\
  \ people: Some people portrait Americans as \"cold\" people, but in fact, they are\
  \ really friendly and kind.\n- Americans are very straightforward (in general):\
  \ They like to express their ideas very clearly and without ambiguities.\n- Americans\
  \ like personal initiative and innovation: They like that people can develop their\
  \ own ideas and do positive things.\n- It's not only about \"baseball\": You can\
  \ also find here another popular sports such as American football, basketball, soccer,\
  \ hockey, etc.\n- It's not only about \"fast food\": You can find foods from all\
  \ parts of the word (such as pasta and pies), and also organic/vegan options.\n\
  - It's not only about \"Hollywood\" and \"Disney\": The USA is not only defined\
  \ by mass media entertainment, they also value old-fashioned things.\n- Each state\
  \ has different laws and different culture: Each state has unique characteristics\
  \ such as landscapes, weather, life cost, customs, etc.\n- The southern side is\
  \ warmer than the northern side: You can find sand and snow in this country.\n-\
  \ A multicultural society: You can find people of all countries, all races, all\
  \ religions, and all cultures gathered together.\n- A multilingual country: Besides\
  \ English, Spanish is also widely spoken here, and other languages such as French\
  \ and Indigenous dialects.\n\nSo far, I have traveled and visited some interesting\
  \ countries such as USA, Brazil, Trinidad & Tobago, and the Bahamas around the Americas\
  \ region.\nAnd I noted a big and vibrant diversity in those places. It helped to\
  \ see my own country and culture in another perspective.\nVenezuelans are well known\
  \ for being friendly, funny, empathetic, workers, and open-minded. \nWe can adapt\
  \ ourselves to every place and make ourselves be noted.\n\nThe language, the food,\
  \ the customs, the festivities, the beliefs, etc... each cultural element can define\
  \ our own identity.\nAccording to my experience, I can draw the following conclusions:\n\
  USA: The land of baseball, fast-food, and freedom.\nBrazil: The land of football,\
  \ samba, and carnivals.\nTrinidad & Tobago: The land of creoles.\nBahamas: The land\
  \ of crystal waters and sunny beaches.\nVenezuela: The land of oil and wild nature.\n\
  \nAs a language enthusiast and as a full-time translator, I've realized that the\
  \ way I live and the way I communicate, is not the only one.\nI consider myself\
  \ a cosmopolitan and multicultural person, I like to connect with people from other\
  \ countries and different cultures than mine. \nSometimes we have more things in\
  \ common than we really think. For me, rhe idea of traveling is exploring what makes\
  \ us different and unique.\nWe all are different and think different, but we will\
  \ always have something in common: humanity. \nWe all are one... it\u2019s all about\
  \ connecting the points! :)"
