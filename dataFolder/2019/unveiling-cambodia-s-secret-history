Text: "In Cambodia, something missing. It\u2019s an absence that might not capture\
  \ your attention immediately, but once it does, you\u2019ll be hard-pressed to redirect\
  \ your thoughts. As you walk along the sleepy city streets, or cycle through the\
  \ lush countryside, you will undoubtedly be greeted by plenty of youthful faces\u2014\
  eager to shower you with waves and laughter. However, to meet someone with leathered\
  \ skin and graying hair is more of a rarity. Cruising along the Praek Tuek Chhu\
  \ river in Kampot, I realized that it had been days since I\u2019d encountered anyone\
  \ of senior citizen status. And after taking the time to explore this captivating\
  \ country\u2019s heartbreaking history, this missing demographic began to make sense.\
  \ \n \nIn the short window between 1975 and 1979, communist dictator Pol Pot was\
  \ responsible for the deaths of nearly 2 million innocent Cambodians. Pledging to\
  \ destroy Capitalism and build an agrarian utopia, Pot and his regime \u2014the\
  \ Khmer Rouge \u2014set out to cleanse the nation of anyone who could pose a threat\
  \ to his new, xenophobic society. Not only were respected professionals like doctors\
  \ and lawyers targeted, but individuals with any semblance of an education \u2014\
  like those who had attended elementary school or who simply wore glasses\u2014were\
  \ senselessly murdered.\n \nFlash forward forty years, and Cambodia is earning its\
  \ title as the ultimate comeback kid. Brimming with a bustling tourism industry\
  \ and the widespread implementation of modern infrastructure, it\u2019s almost impossible\
  \ to believe that this country has rebuilt itself from the ground up after losing\
  \ a staggering 25% of its population and entire generations. But admiring the collective\
  \ resilience of this beautiful nation should not blind us from respecting the catastrophic\
  \ heartbreak felt by its people. I was fortunate enough to listen to a firsthand\
  \ account of this eye-opening reality, thanks to a few sweltering days in the back\
  \ of a tuk tuk driven by Mr. Corn\u2014a survivor of Pol Pot\u2019s terror.\n \n\
  Mr. Corn cannot confirm his exact age, but he guesses he is pushing 65. He bases\
  \ this estimate off a blurry memory of being in his early twenties when he was captured\
  \ by the Khmer Rouge. Mr. Corn and his brother were taken prisoner and expected\
  \ to face a similar fate as their parents who had been brutally murdered. For months\
  \ the two boys teetered on the brink of death, forced to live in inhumane conditions\
  \ while withstanding regular physical violence. As captives they were fed little\
  \ to no food, and knew that if they did not score more to eat, they wouldn\u2019\
  t stand a chance.\n \nIn a moment of blind desperation, Mr. Corn made a decision\
  \ that would either save his life or surely end it. When night fell, he snuck out\
  \ of the compound and stole rations of corn from a neighboring field. Week after\
  \ week, Mr. Corn repeated this reckless trip, bringing back just enough food to\
  \ fend off starvation. It was this nourishment that allowed the brothers to survive\
  \ an environment that would have otherwise killed them. After years of retelling\
  \ this story in private, the nickname \u201CMr. Corn\u201D was aptly coined.\n \n\
  Of course going by such a title serves as the perfect launch pad for sharing this\
  \ story with travelers\u2014some of whom I\u2019m sure are skeptical of the intention.\
  \ But I for one am forever thankful for this prompt. It\u2019s a difficult pill\
  \ to swallow \u2014remembering that the Western world largely turned its back on\
  \ a genocide that left Cambodia without entire generations of citizens. And yet\
  \ today, these people are still some of the most effervescently warm souls that\
  \ I have met along my travels. Mr. Corn was no exemption. In the days I spent exploring\
  \ the temples of Angkor with him, I was blown away by his generosity\u2014a highlight\
  \ including the invitation I received to attend his grandson\u2019s 4th birthday\
  \ party.\n\nIt was a harrowing thing\u2014to be met with so much light from a man\
  \ who has experienced what others would view as insurmountable darkness. But this\
  \ is a theme felt across Cambodia. Instead of slipping into bitterness, these people\
  \ are pushing forward with forgiveness, choosing to embrace the cathartic benefits\
  \ of sharing their stories\u2014without fear of the repercussions \u2014for the\
  \ first time in decades."
