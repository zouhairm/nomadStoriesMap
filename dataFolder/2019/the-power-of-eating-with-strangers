Text: "The 5am call to prayer woke me as it billowed across the desert into my open\
  \ window, echoing off the canyon walls, reverberating around the valley. Roosters\
  \ started crowing, dogs barking, goats bleating, and camels groaning, waiting for\
  \ their morning meals.\n\nOne hundred degrees, again. Looking down at my jeans,\
  \ denim over-shirt, and tie-dyed t-shirt I tried to remember what I had been thinking.\
  \ When I moved to the Jordanian desert, I decided to cover my arms and legs out\
  \ of cultural respect, naively thinking that the temperature would cool down by\
  \ September.\n\nI walked down the dirt road to buy onions and fresh pita rounds\
  \ requested by a woman with whom I was staying, as deeply ingrained traditions prevent\
  \ girls older than fourteen from going to the market. I returned with the groceries\
  \ and was told to squeeze into an old, white pickup truck with her family. I asked\
  \ where we were going but received no answer. My onions and pita supplemented 5\
  \ raw chickens already in the truck. \n\nThe concrete houses faded away and we made\
  \ a sharp left turn into the open desert. Over a small incline, tin huts and tents\
  \ came into view: families who refused to move to the village, preferring life embedded\
  \ in the sand.\n\nWe disembarked and the truck sped off, leaving us standing with\
  \ a group of women and children that I had never seen. All eyes were on me. Everyone\
  \ was clad in black burqas of varying elegance, paired with stockings and gloves.\
  \ I was wearing 8-year-old pink Teva sandals, head-to-toe denim with a bit of tie-dye\
  \ peeking out, and my long, brown hair, uncovered.\n\nI was led to a tent made of\
  \ rice sacks stretched over chain-link fencing, told to sit on a fraying, blue and\
  \ green, mat, and was plied with tiny glasses of hot tea. A ten year old named Hiba\
  \ told me to take off my denim over-shirt, but after seeing my t-shirt underneath,\
  \ her mother quickly countered the suggestion. I continued to sweat profusely into\
  \ the sand. After more tea they invited me into the kitchen. The stove sat on one\
  \ side, connected to a lopsided gas tank. Dishes secured in mesh bags hung from\
  \ corrugated tin walls. Two women kneeled in the sand around a vat of raw chicken.\
  \ \n\nMost of my day was spent with the children, who were eager to practice their\
  \ English. After reciting animal names, seven year old Mohammed asked, in Arabic,\
  \ if I prayed. I hesitated, shocked by the abrupt subject change, and unsure what\
  \ to say. Recalling conversations with friends in which they urged me not to share\
  \ my Jewish identity, discussing travelers and journalists who were killed for their\
  \ religion, I answered, \u201CNo, I do not.\u201D Without faltering, he asked, \u201C\
  Are you Jewish?\u201D Fatigued from the heat, I hesitated again. Before I could\
  \ respond, Hiba, with whom I had spent most of the afternoon while she contentedly\
  \ and systematically tried on all of my jewelry, jumped in to deride him. Not for\
  \ his ill-manners, but because in her mind, I was white, American, and therefore\
  \ undoubtedly Christian. I remained quiet.\n\nEventually the women paraded from\
  \ the kitchen and urged us deeper into the desert, through the maze of animal corrals\
  \ and water tanks, to another tent, where I garnered strange looks from a new group\
  \ of women.\n\nA huge platter of rice, carefully laden with chicken and sprinkled\
  \ with parsley and peanuts was encircled by 18 women of all ages. A signal was given,\
  \ undetected by me, and lunch began. I had practiced eating with my hands but hadn\u2019\
  t mastered it, somewhat hampered by being left-handed. (In Jordan, left hands are\
  \ unclean and not used for eating.) I leaned back to observe, immediately offending\
  \ the cooks, who assumed I was displeased. Not wanting to continue my offense, I\
  \ surreptitiously stole glances and small bites as I perfected my technique\u2026\
  .\n\nPull a piece of chicken, grab some rice as your hand moves from the center\
  \ of the platter toward your mouth. Roll the bite in your palm to shape and let\
  \ cool. Slide into mouth. Repeat to heart\u2019s content. For the first time all\
  \ afternoon, I felt at ease."
