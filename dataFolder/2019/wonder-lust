Text: "Laying in my pink room with my sister's orange suitcase that she let me borrow\
  \ for this trip . My eyes wide open staring at the stars I placed on my ceiling\
  \ when I was a little girl, wondering where this adventure will take me, spiritually,\
  \ mentally, and a little physically. I have no sense of direction so I had little\
  \ to no clue of where exactly I would be in the next 48 hours. \nI was going to\
  \ Israel, the holy land! I had no idea what i was going to embark on my journey\
  \ and I can't say I was thrilled. I was scared but determined. I had saved my money\
  \ for the three months study tour I was going on over the summer I worked in the\
  \ little beach town I attended bible college at. Instead of saving for a car like\
  \ my parents suggested I was traveling, and I couldn't be any more sure of my decision\
  \ then that summer. \nUntil I was laying in my room staring at the stars, thinking\
  \ only about the train ride I had to take when I arrived in a foreign place at night\
  \ all by myself. I would arrive in Tel Aviv, Israel at 10 PM, navigating in a air\
  \ port and finding a train and where I was going next 6,890 miles away from my home\
  \ in little Nampa, Idaho. I couldn't navigate in my home town, so how am I suppose\
  \ to get to Ako, Israel?\nI woke up that morning to little to no sleep with my stomach\
  \ turning in unbelief that this was happening and I that got myself here. to fulfill\
  \ one of my dreams, traveling. I felt like I haven't woken up, that I was dreaming.\
  \ But I was far from asleep, even tho I was scared and felt completely uncomfortable,\
  \ I was living, free, and definitely wide awake. I went to church that morning then\
  \ out to eat with my family. A boy who liked me was there till almost the second\
  \ I left. I was annoyed with his presence because I was vulnerable and scared and\
  \ I didn't want him to see it. I was relieved when he left and opened up to my parents.\
  \ My parent's weren't scared, they were calm. They had no problem sending me across\
  \ the world to meet with people they never met. I felt as if the rules should've\
  \ been reversed. They be scared for my safety and wonder if this is all a big hoax\
  \ for someone to kidnap me and take advantage of me and I be calm. But no, I was\
  \ afraid of being kidnapped, but that wasn't my biggest fear because the train ride\
  \ was. I was afraid I would lost. \nWe got to the airport, and I was a mess. Thank\
  \ goodness my family was there to keep everything in order, but soon I would be\
  \ on my own. We said our goodbyes and prayed before I boarded. My first flight was\
  \ from Boise, Idaho to San Francisco. When I got on the plain I already felt better\
  \ because I got a window seat and sat by a really attractive New Zealand guy. He\
  \ had wavy hair that went to his chin, and the expression on his face reminded me\
  \ of Fin Rider from Tangled, a smolder. We talked and my cheeks flushed while he\
  \ told me where he was from and what he was doing. He traveled to America to do\
  \ a sport every year, he was so cool. I was a happy girl, until this thirdly year\
  \ old man sat between us. It was an hour in a half flight and I learned that he\
  \ was at a bachelor's party camping and getting drunk. We talked while the attractive\
  \ New Zealand guy fell asleep. I told him about my journey's, and he wished me luck,\
  \ then I wasn't so disappointed that he sat between us because I was grateful for\
  \ his encouragement."
