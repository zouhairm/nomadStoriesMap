Text: "Feeling nauseous, I look out of the window of the small van onto the winding\
  \ roads of the beautiful Waitomo Valley of New Zealand. Voices around me are excitedly\
  \ discussing what we are about to experience, but they are drowned out by the adrenaline\
  \ pounding ceaselessly in my ears. \u201CThree hours underground\u201D and \u201C\
  not for the faint-hearted\u201D play over and over in my head like a broken record.\
  \ I have sworn to myself upon leaving for my world trip that I\u2019ll break out\
  \ of my shell and won\u2019t be held back by the thing that scares me more than\
  \ anything else in this world - confined spaces. The closer we get to the caves,\
  \ the more my seatbelt feels like it is slowly suffocating me. What have I gotten\
  \ myself into? We all get out of the car, most people jumping gleefully out of their\
  \ seats for the adventure. I force a smile, as I do way too often and try not to\
  \ ruin the experience for the others. My friends simply cannot comprehend the burden\
  \ they have put on my shoulders by convincing me to accompany them to the \u2018\
  Hagga\u2019s Honkin\u2019 Holes\u2019 caving tour. I swear to this day, I could\
  \ smell the cave from the training site, its mossy freshness creeping up to me:\
  \ the odor of certain doom. After the charming induction, making an abseil into\
  \ nothingness is supposed to feel easy to me now. The instructor has dealt with\
  \ many anxious people, I am sure, but hearing him say \u2018In case of a collapse\u2026\
  \u2019 makes me feel as terrified as ever. I fight back my tears as we slowly hike\
  \ up to the little hole that will swallow us all for the next three hours, making\
  \ me feel overpowered by nature. First, a metal latter: I count 25 rungs. With each\
  \ step I take, hooking my carabiner into the loops, I am slowly eaten up by the\
  \ darkness. Down here, all that exists is little insects, moss and as of now ten\
  \ human beings. I am second in the group, always watching my friend closely, hoping\
  \ to somehow gain some of his confidence. The abseil, which I have been dreading\
  \ the most, comes first. Thirty meters down and all that separates me and death\
  \ is a rope. I close my eyes, grip my harness, take a deep breath and leap off the\
  \ edge. Surrounded by damp air, strapped into my wet suit, I dive into the unknown\
  \ - jump by jump I feel myself going further into the lion\u2019s den. I cannot\
  \ put into words the reassuring feeling of rock under my feet as I finally touch\
  \ the ground. What felt like an eternity was probably just one passing minute, but\
  \ with a smile on my face I open my eyes and look at my hands. Blood is running\
  \ down my shaking palms, from how hard I gripped the rope. I look up and find myself\
  \ amidst an illuminated room, filled with thousands of little lights. Glow worms,\
  \ burning off their food waste remind me why I do this. This is not about risking\
  \ my life, this is about appreciating my environment and the fact that I can be\
  \ down here. I\u2019m in a cave, everybody is healthy and the culprit behind my\
  \ crippling fear is me. The fear of death should not stop me living. Suddenly, that\
  \ smile I have been wearing as a mask turns into a real one. Every obstacle I will\
  \ face in the next three hours I can finish if I put my mind to it. As I step into\
  \ that last room, I am prouder of myself than I ever was. A travel mug of piping\
  \ hot coffee and a small piece of dark chocolate are waiting for me on a rock. I\
  \ sit down and nibble off small bites, all I can hear is my own heartbeat and the\
  \ sounds of dribbling water. I speak of this experience until this day, exactly\
  \ one year later. It is incredible how comforted you can feel by a place that is\
  \ so absent of everything that we hold dear."
