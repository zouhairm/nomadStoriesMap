Text: "\u201CWhere will you go?\u201D my friends ask. \n\u201CEverywhere my wallet\
  \ will allow,\u201D I reply, apprehensive of its contents. \n\u201CWhat are your\
  \ plans?\u201D \n\u201CEverything but abduction and death,\u201D I semi-joke. \n\
  I regale them with details of my upcoming adventures, listing off the sites I\u2019\
  ll see, excursions I\u2019ll make over the next year. We\u2019re in my local Brooklyn\
  \ bar, every inch of the curated space shining under the luminescent globe lamps\
  \ above. I glow with expectant delirium, hoping that leaving this hodgepodge of\
  \ a family will be worth it. Seeing the world is going to change me. Change everything.\
  \ \n\nI take a breath, close my eyes, and soak it all in.\n\nMy eyes pop open and\
  \ I find myself in bed. Not my bed, but the bed my parents own. In the house my\
  \ parents own. I check my phone \u2013 it\u2019s 11:30 a.m. Since the start of this\
  \ (cross your fingers) short detour, I have decided that I will not be setting alarms.\
  \ Sleeping the day away seems easier than finding ways to entertain myself. Reluctantly,\
  \ I get out of bed, open the blinds, feel my heart sink, as I look at another grey\
  \ day -- lackluster -- frozen -- dead. The trees like arthritic fingers, reaching\
  \ up towards the heavens, begging to be uprooted from their existence in this town.\
  \ \n\n\u201CHow in the world am I back here?\u201D\n\nNew Philadelphia, \u201Cnope,\
  \ different than the one in Pennsylvania\u201D, Ohio: a not even Midwest town of\
  \ just over eight square miles right smack dab in the middle of nowhere. Inhabiting\
  \ about 17,000 people, New Philadelphia has a population density of a little over\
  \ 2,000 per square mile. New York City: 27,000. \n\nIt\u2019s one of those \u201C\
  go to the local career center, get a job, work really hard, find someone to marry\
  \ before they\u2019re all taken, buy a house, have kids, work, hate your job, work\
  \ some more, retire as soon as possible, never leave\u201D towns. Silver lining?\
  \ Every Thursday is 50 cent wing night with half priced pints to make choking life\
  \ down a little easier. You get the picture: it\u2019s small and I want big. Bigger\
  \ than I could have thought to imagine within the 0.0001345 square miles of my childhood\
  \ home. Bigger even than the nearly 200 mile panoramic view from the top of the\
  \ Empire State building. I yearn to be awed by the holy monstrosity of Mount Everest\
  \ and shed history fueled tears with Every. Single. Step. across the Great Wall!\n\
  \nInstead, I\u2019m riding shotgun in my dad\u2019s truck, on our way to visit my\
  \ grandma\u2019s grave. We ease past a mountain of trash -- broken couch, ripped\
  \ mattress, old plastic toys -- and I rhetorically wonder aloud how he managed to\
  \ survive this place his entire life. He surprises me with his rarely used serious\
  \ voice, \u201CThis is my family home.\u201D I catch a peek at his gap-toothed grin\
  \ as he mentally skims through photo albums. \u201CHere you guys run through puddles\
  \ in the rain and swing from a rope under our giant maple tree. There\u2019s no\
  \ other place I\u2019d rather build a home and have you visit to relive those days.\
  \ Here is where you make timeless memories with your siblings, instill wonder in\
  \ your kids and lay your parents to rest.\u201D \n\nTears fill my eyes.\n\nWe keep\
  \ driving and I notice the Tuscarawas County Courthouse cozily resting in the center\
  \ of town under a dome, once copper, now transformed a pale blue that gets lost\
  \ in the sky on a perfect summer day. Its Corinthian columns nobly frame the front\
  \ doors, announcing its strength and welcoming us. \n\nI am home again. \n\n\n\t\
  \t\t\t\t\t*  *  *\n\n\nMaybe backpacking around the world isn\u2019t the only way\
  \ to experience change and see things differently. Reliving my dad\u2019s endearing\
  \ words, I recognize the difference between sparkly Instagram posts, and life. Peace\
  \ can be found in the greyest of winters, in what I thought was the plainest of\
  \ towns, during what was sure to be the most boring time of my life. Turns out the\
  \ only thing lacking, was me.\n\nAgain, I\u2019m sitting shotgun, this time on the\
  \ way to the airport -- with one adventure, maybe the most impactful of them all,\
  \ checked off the bucket list."
