Text: "\u201CBe discrete with this portion\u201D pleaded Carlos, one of the guides\
  \ of Leon\u2019s free walking tour. Apparently, the owner of the company had discouraged\
  \ him from discussing Nicaragua\u2019s current political situation. After having\
  \ been warned against visiting Nicaragua by both the governmental advisory and countless\
  \ friends, I fully understood the importance of maintaining what little tourism\
  \ remained. However, this didn\u2019t stop me from wanting to get to know Carlos\
  \ as a person, to dive underneath the glossy fa\xE7ade that every tourist-driven\
  \ country presents to foreigners. \nDressed in jeans and a plain blue shirt, Carlos\
  \ could have been any of the other Nicaraguans or foreigners milling around the\
  \ streets underneath the great Cathedral of Leon. Yet he spoke with a bravery that\
  \ could easily have been taken for granted if it wasn\u2019t for every flinch and\
  \ lowering of the voice when a police officer walked passed. Our discussion topic\
  \ was clearly taboo. Upon arriving in Nicaragua I saw no signs of the political\
  \ unrest that had seemed so inevitable. There wasn\u2019t a particularly high military\
  \ presence and people seemed to be progressing throughout their days without interruption.\
  \ The only visible sign was the prominent lack of tourists. \nIt wasn\u2019t until\
  \ I was walking with Carlos that I was able to see what was lying just underneath\
  \ the pristine veneer.  He pointed out the section of cobblestone road that had\
  \ been covered over with concrete, a nearly invisible remnant of the barricades\
  \ that had been built there just months before. He told me personal stories of students\
  \ participating in protests shut down by powerful militia. I learned about friends\
  \ that had mysteriously disappeared within the past few months.\nYet while discussing\
  \ protests reminiscent of those in 1979, Carlos remained patriotic and passionate.\
  \ He was hopeful that with some international oversight at the next election it\
  \ didn\u2019t have to come to the same violent end. The optimism obviously wasn\u2019\
  t blind, but Carlos demonstrated the vibrancy of the next generation. We sat together\
  \ on the steps in front of a basketball court framed by a partially bombed 1979\
  \ mural. The court was buzzing with the smack talking and activity that you would\
  \ find anywhere in the world. Across the street the Student Federation Building\
  \ was covered in tarps as it had recently been set ablaze in the April protests.\
  \ But sitting there surrounded by signs of destruction all I could concentrate on\
  \ was enjoying one of the delicious Quesillos omnipresent on every street corner\
  \ with Carlos. \nIt is these random local connections and surprise nights that make\
  \ traveling worthwhile. There is never the black and white that we see scrolling\
  \ across our internet feeds. Leon is a place where tourists can happily pose atop\
  \ the white domes of the Cathedral or climb a volcano for the sole purpose of barreling\
  \ down it as quickly as possible. It is also a place where the citizens are willing\
  \ to stand up for what they believe in. But as the night progressed, we could have\
  \ been anywhere, two people talking about their lives, their experiences, hopes\
  \ and dreams. It is this that makes traveling worth it."
