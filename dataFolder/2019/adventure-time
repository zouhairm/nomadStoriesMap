Text: "Since I was a child I was mesmerized by the idea of exploring. I was surrounded\
  \ by so many advertisements, books and movies which were sending me far away from\
  \ my country. I was fascinated by the idea of exploring new horizons, pushing my\
  \ limits or discovering new cultures. After several years of strggles, thoughts,\
  \ dreams and thousands of questions \u201D what if? \u201D, thanks to my sister\u2019\
  s hard work I  received the chance to accomplish my dream. Day by day, the time\
  \ was passing and I tried to prepare myself, I watched many videous about what I\
  \ should know and how to pack my things and everything about traveling. The big\
  \ day has come and I arrived at the airport, everything  seemed to be challenging\
  \ and for the first time  I felt the fear of the unknown. The women which worked\
  \ at the check in asked me if I really have 18 years old and I felt like a woman\
  \ who escaped from a prison, even if I had not done anything wrong. After I made\
  \ the check in, another challenge appeared. I was looking for the gate, the  duty\
  \ free seemed to be endless and I thought that I got lost and the plane would depart\
  \ without me. I found the gate and I was going to get into the plane. The feelings\
  \ I got were intense.I could not believe is true. The plane was taking off and and\
  \ my heart beated frantically. It seemed that I lost my consciousness because i\
  \ saw black in front of my eyes,but after some secounds I felt released and so happy.\
  \ Even if was 9 P.M. and all I saw was the lights of the cities I kept my eyes on\
  \ the window all the time. It was like a dream. The hours passed so quickly and\
  \ I was going to arrive. The typical weather of United Kingdom welcomed me in a\
  \ strong hug of rain and it felt like a blessing because the rain made me feel calm.\
  \ Of course the challenges did not stop. My sister did not answered my calls because\
  \ she was waiting for me with flowers  to make me a surprise and I was detained\
  \ by the Border Force because it was my first time of traveling with the plane by\
  \ my self in another country. Finally she talked with the border force officer and\
  \ I found her and hugged her very tight. My english experience has begun. My sister\
  \ assured that I will enjoy all of the important experiences that England could\
  \ give me. Therefore we were going to discover all the surroundings we could and\
  \ to stay in the house only to sleep. We woke up pretty early in the morning to\
  \ pack the food and things we need to visit the places we were looking for. We went\
  \ from a city to another with the train or the typical red bus( London, Crawley,\
  \ Bognor Regis, Brighton, Richmond and so on). I did not want to lose anything so\
  \ I captured all I saw: a lot of small english cottages, streets, graffiti, people.\
  \ I was definitely fascinated. Also I wrote about any place I saw, unknown words\
  \ or differences between the english culture and romanian culture. After we finished\
  \ to visit something, the crazy rush in saving time or finding the right train has\
  \ begun again. I got a newspaper from anywhere I went to keep it like a souvenir\
  \ and to improve my english language skill. Because of my sister\u2019s wish for\
  \ improving my english I talked with the bus driver, seller or any people I could\
  \ interacted with. Even in the last day of my journey I  got another challenge .\
  \ When I pass through the security, I went on the escalator which goes only up.\
  \ Suddenly I realised that I forgot my hand bag at my sister and she forgot her\
  \ phone at home. I run dazed in the opposite direction and found a security guardian\
  \ who helped me to get my hand bag. This experience was a crazy one which made me\
  \ get out of my confort zone and feel like I am capable o everything."
