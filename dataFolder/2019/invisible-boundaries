Text: "In a country with vibrant colours, happy faces, fishermen delight, and the\
  \ sound of crashing waves, living on the beachside in Colombo 7 was the best therapy\
  \ I could ever need. \n\nI stayed at the house of a family friend's neighbour who\
  \ took me in, fed me some delicious pothu roti and the spiciest of the fish curries\
  \ along with custard and love cakes. The four-day trip let me meet, great, and know\
  \ the locals, the culture, the area around, and the beautiful beaches for sure.\
  \ \n\nAs an Indian citizen visiting Colombo, there isn't a lot of difference between\
  \ the two countries however, I felt as though I'm home, these people here looking\
  \ after me and meeting me are family, the street dogs are ones I fed long back and\
  \ know me, the waves are familiar to my presence, and the skies shower their rain\
  \ on me as a welcome back present. \n\nI clicked images that are now lost in my\
  \ broken phone, how much I wish I had taken my camera with me. Nonetheless, the\
  \ memories made, the food eaten, the love shared, the unique places visited, are\
  \ all so etched in my mind that those are the ones I would never forget! \n\nHave\
  \ you ever been to a place that you never wanted to leave? Colombo was for me."
