Text: "It was time to make a stop after 15 days of exhausting eight-hour day walks,\
  \ we arrived at the temboche.\n A small village located in the hymalayas mountain\
  \ range on the way to the top closer to the heavens and farther from the world of\
  \ mortals.\nmy legs needed a rest and my stomach rumbled fame like a raging ocean.\n\
  After asking in some hotels for a room and food, our budget was not enough. We walked\
  \ a few meters between children and yaks, suddenly we saw a small adobe house and\
  \ sheet metal. Immediately we understood that it was where the sherpas made their\
  \ stops to rest, we touched the setting and a woman with her son in her arms, came\
  \ out to meet us.\nour exhausted faces, our fallen eyes pierced the idiomatic barriers\
  \ and she with a smile opened the doors of her house.\nInside his family lived in\
  \ a small environment where the kitchen, fed by yak waste heated our lunch, everyone\
  \ looked in amazement at the foreigners who stopped where the locals.\nwe had an\
  \ incredible dal bat, mountain food for the sherpas, with rice, potatoes and lentil\
  \ soup, we played with the children of the family and decided to spend the night\
  \ where we shared a gigantic communal bed in the same place where we had dined.\n\
  The night was cold and windy, the little house was moving as it breathed by the\
  \ air that entered between its cracks.\nthe next morning we had breakfast in silence\
  \ respecting the rhythm of the family that dawned early to carry weight on their\
  \ backs and as good sherpas to carry it to other villages.\nAfter paying we said\
  \ goodbye as we arrived, thanking him with a gesture of reverence, for having opened\
  \ the doors of his house and with a smile, a universal language."
