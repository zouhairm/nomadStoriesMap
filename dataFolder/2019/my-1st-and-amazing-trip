  \ except studying medicine. Lol! (because I'm always bound with the books) . Understanding\
  \ the french culture their food. I cannot express in words what i felt! As I was\
  \ travelling alone, I communicated with so many locals their and damn! World has\
  \ sooo much  of positivity. We just have to stop for a while and look around! I\
  \ love travelling.  Specially when I'm alone. After travelling to pondicherry and\
  \ chennai.  I instantly made another plan to goa. Can you imagine?  I'm just 21\
  \ and i made it to GOA, ALONE!!!!! GOA is the most beautiful place in terms of everything.\
  \ Let it be late night parties in north goa or the family friendly  south goa! Beaches\
  \ after 10pm loooks so surreal. I would definately love to go there time and again!\
  \ And lastly how can i forget telling about the most wonderful and culture rich\
  \ place VARANASI!!  THE GREAT KUMBH MELA!! I have nooo words for that place. Its\
