Text: "The Mango Party\n\nGonzalo frantically turned the ignition but the spluttering\
  \ whine diminished into a hapless clickety-clack. Corkscrew-shaped curls framed\
  \ his terrified eyes as bandits on horseback surrounded the pickup. Swathed in claustrophobia,\
  \ a stench of fear and stomach knotted in panic with an overpowering urge to take\
  \ flight.\n\u2018No go out Se\xF1or Meeles,\u2019 screamed Gonzalo.\nEl Escal\xF3\
  n had the notion of being a solitary cloud in the sky above mountain peaks and plateaus\
  \ interspersed by emerald valleys. Blinded by the shimmering heat haze, I looked\
  \ up at the semicircle of silhouettes in sombreros peering down.\n\u2018Necesita\
  \ ayuda?\u2019 said the older man through his droopy moustache while dismounting,\
  \ \u2018eres Americano?\u2019\n\u2018From England, mi Espa\xF1ol no es bueno,\u2019\
  \ I stammered.\n\u2018What you doing here gringo?\u2019 snarled the young outlaw.\n\
  Suddenly, a beautiful girl appeared with a sunshine smile and kind-hearted amber\
  \ eyes.\n\u2018Welcome to our village. My name is G\xFCerita Santos.\u2019 She thrust\
  \ out a slender arm. I clasped her elegant hand.\n\u2018We assumed these men were\
  \ desperados.\u2019\nShe giggled, \u2018They\u2019re my brothers, Antonio, Victor,\
  \ Pablo, Juan and Pedro.\u2019\n\u2018That\u2019s such a relief! I\u2019m Miles\
  \ and he\u2019s Gonzalo, we\u2019re looking for Octavio\u2019s fruit farm.\u2019\
  \n\u2018What\u2019s the purpose of your visit?\u2019\n\u2018To study local horticulture.\u2019\
  \n\u2018While Gonzalo repairs the truck, I\u2019ll show you around the Santos ranch.\u2019\
  \nAs we walked, her long wavy hair swirled over a hand-embroidered dress striped\
  \ scarlet and butterscotch.\n\u2018What type of produce do you cultivate?\u2019\n\
  \u2018Mangos are our signature crop, however, the season is brief, whereas the blue\
  \ agave is shipped to the distilleries every month. The State of Jalisco produce\
  \ eighty per cent of the tequila in Mexico.\u2019\nThe Santos mangos had the enviable\
  \ reputation of being the best tasting tropical fruit in Jalisco. Rancheros scaled\
  \ the twenty-metre-high trees to harvest the crop, one by one, using long extendable\
  \ poles with a tiny net to select the ripe mangos. Deemed the king of fruits, these\
  \ lime-green, banana-yellow and cherry-red beauties were at their best. I delicately\
  \ peeled the skin and released an exotic perfume. The luscious juice ran down my\
  \ arm. Oval-shaped and apple-sized with the rich pulpy texture of an overripe plum,\
  \ they were succulent, sweet and silky.\n\u2018Do you grow anything else?\u2019\n\
  \u2018A small amount of avocados, sweet limes and nopal cactus.\u2019\n\u2018Your\
  \ English is perfect.\u2019\n\u2018Thank you, I lived in California for three years.\u2019\
  \nThe hacienda, colour-washed in powder blue, had a pink pantile roof. We strode\
  \ through heavy wooden doors flanked by spindled-window grills. Heaps of giant pineapple-shaped\
  \ hearts from the agave plant were spread over the courtyard. Mama sat in a rustic\
  \ leather chair beneath a canopy of flowering vines draped in a cotton shawl of\
  \ burgundy patchwork. Her silver hair tied back in a ballet bun.\n\u2018When my\
  \ father passed away, Mama became head of the family.\u2019\n\u2018Mama, este es\
  \ Miles de Inglaterra.\u2019\nRemoving her half-moon spectacles, she gave me an\
  \ affectionate embrace and kissed both cheeks, \u2018Mucho gusto Meeles,\u2019 I\
  \ sensed a compassionate and caring individual with a stoical inner strength.\n\
  She whispered in her daughter\u2019s ear\u2026G\xFCerita beamed with pride, \u2018\
  Mama invites you both to our end-of-season mango party.\u2019\n\u2018Thank you,\
  \ we are honoured.\u2019\nThe plaza teemed with cowboys and cowgirls in their celebratory\
  \ white Stetsons, polished cowboy boots or vibrant folklorico dresses. Children\
  \ as little rancheros wore miniature outfits. The Mariachi octet played until the\
  \ early hours. After the fiesta melted away, G\xFCerita and I sat in front of a\
  \ chimenea as the flames flickered in the dark. She was a polished, worldly and\
  \ stylish lady who exuded a warmth from her heart. Her light skin, fair hair and\
  \ soft, honey-coloured eyes stood out as being different from the rest of the family.\n\
  The burnt orange mountaintops were the first sign of dawn as G\xFCerita took me\
  \ by the hand past the rustling mango trees, up a lofty trail to her secret hideaway.\
  \ A clear pool set back in a wooded copse overlooking the cloudless cordillera where\
  \ she spent many a precious moment of her happy childhood. We shared mangos and\
  \ dangled our feet in the cool spring water \u2013 laughter echoed around the chamber.\
  \ Gonzalo\u2019s faint voice drifted up from the ranch, \u2018La camioneta is ready\
  \ Se\xF1or Meeles.\u2019"
