Text: "\u201CIt has a  swimming pool and karaoke, no food or service though since\
  \ it\u2019s not open yet, so you can stay overnight, free of charge, and I will\
  \ drive you to the bus stop tomorrow morning\u201D\n\nThat seemed to have been enough\
  \ to convince two nineteen-year-old backpackers. Since our hostel was very basic,\
  \ not very clean, and the sandboarding experience did cost us more than planned,\
  \ the thought of sleeping in a comfy bed did appeal to us. We checked out from our\
  \ hostel in Huacachina and headed with Manu, our sandboarding instructor we met\
  \ that day, to his friend\u2019s hotel. On the way, he stopped and picked up another\
  \ guy \u201CMore the merrier, right?!\u201D. This didn\u2019t seem proper to me,\
  \ and by the looks of Michi\u2019s face, I could tell she was confused too. \u201C\
  Oh, there is no network service of any kind over there, it's quite far from the\
  \ town\u201D he added lightly while the small Peruvian oasis stayed behind us. \n\
  \nAs we drove further, the desert started slowly disappearing and not after long\
  \ there were just farm fields bathing in the sunset. All around us we could see\
  \ white dots on the top of the green sprouts. I looked in wonder, \u201CIt is cotton\u201D\
  , he said, \u201C just blooming, do you want to pick one?\u201C As he stopped the\
  \ car, our eyes stared in the amazement, completely forgetting about the danger\
  \ we might have been in. The fields of cotton were spreading around us as far as\
  \ the eye could see, touching the flaming sky somewhere in the horizon. I ran into\
  \ the field and started touching the puffy surface of the plants. To my surprise,\
  \ it was quite harsh, and it took some time for me to actually pluck it off nicely.\
  \ Looking at the sunset, soaking up the warmth, seizing the image of the beauty\
  \ all around me, my eyes fell on Michi\u2019s frightened face in the car. Then it\
  \ struck me, the position we were in- South America, far from civilization, unfamiliar\
  \ men taking us god-knows-where, no connectivity, with all our stuff, passports,\
  \ money\u2026\n\nAbout forty min after, we approached an estate. Behind the walls\
  \ was a large, T-shaped building made of yellow bricks and dark brown window shades.\
  \ The big, sturdy gate did not lack security and it sealed shut after our vehicle\
  \ came into the driveway. During the ride we made them laugh, I opened a bottle\
  \ of whiskey and started a sing-a-long with the radio. Music helped break the ice,\
  \ so they were already red in the face when we entered the house. My plan was to\
  \ get them drunk and unconscious somehow. \n\nThe lobby looked like a wealthy hunting\
  \ lodge - a lot of animal heads on the walls and a big fireplace. It was like no\
  \ one lived there for years, very cold, dusty, and with one aggregate working, so\
  \ there was light only in the lobby and in front, around the pool. Sun was almost\
  \ gone so the halls and the rooms slowly stayed in darkness. Two other guys welcomed\
  \ us, drinking already. The paralyzing feeling of fear and panic started crawling\
  \ all over my body but I just took the mike and started singing. \n\nIntroducing\
  \ some drinking games I knew from university, using cheats and \u201Cthis is a famous\
  \ cocktail from my country, we always drink it bottoms-up!\u201D, my Bosnian-background-high\
  \ alcohol tolerance finally paid off - the guys were sleeping all over the floor\
  \ by midnight. We went to the room and jammed the door with a chair. Crawled up\
  \ on a bed together, we stayed awake waiting for the morning.\n\nEverything was\
  \ easier with the sunlight bursting through the shades again. I quietly woke up\
  \ Manu, while everyone else was still comatose. He was too hungover to talk, so\
  \ without too much convincing, he drove us to the station where we caught our bus\
  \ to Nasca. We never met any of them again, but we learned our lesson, we survived.\
  \ Still, nowadays, I have preserved that plucked piece of cotton, like a memento\
  \ of a day that could have gone so wrong. Yet, that unforgettable scene of the flaming\
  \ cotton fields will forever stay carved in my memory."
