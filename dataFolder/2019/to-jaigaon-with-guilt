Text: "\u201CHow the hell do we get back to Jaigaon now?\u201D Shraddha screamed,\
  \ turning towards me. I did not turn to look at her. My eyes were fixed on the ATM\
  \ screen in front of me which displayed \u201CError: Unable to read the card. Please\
  \ try again\u201D.  I wondered if it would display a different message on the fourth\
  \ attempt. It did not. \n\nWe walked out of the Royal Monetary Authority of Bhutan\
  \ ATM onto Thimphu\u2019s busiest road, Nordzen Lam. It was unusually quiet for\
  \ the downtown area of a capital city. Or maybe it was just us, who were not able\
  \ to soak in anything else right now. \n\nFew things can be worse than being in\
  \ a foreign country with almost no currency. My friend, Shraddha \u2013 a law student\
  \ in Mumbai \u2013 and I had been in Bhutan for 10 days now, with two more days\
  \ to go, before we had to reach the border town of Jaigaon to crossover into India\
  \ and head home to New Delhi. \n\nAnd here, we were in Thimphu \u2013 90 miles away\
  \ from Jaigaon \u2013 with just 600 Ngultrum ($ 8.60) left with us. To get to Jaigaon\
  \ by the cheapest bus, we needed 500 ($ 7.20) Ngultrum each and therefore 1000 Ngultrum.\
  \ \n\nUntil this moment, it hadn\u2019t been a worry for us as we both had our ATM\
  \ cards from India. Everywhere here in Bhutan, the Indian Rupee can be used and\
  \ its value is equivalent to the Bhutanese Ngultrum. And therefore, when we crossed\
  \ into Bhutan 10 days ago, we had not even bothered to convert the currency. \n\n\
  Except, we did not turn our ATM card around and read the disclaimer at the back,\
  \ written in a minuscule font (almost impossible to read), \u201Ccard not valid\
  \ in Nepal and Bhutan\u201D. \n\nWe slouched onto a bench towards the left of the\
  \ ATM cubicle and sat there for a while without saying a word to each other. A rush\
  \ of thoughts blazed through my head. I did a mental calculation to figure the minimum\
  \ amount of money we would require to last the next two days. But how do we pay\
  \ for the bus that would get us to the border town? \n\nWe finally decided that\
  \ first, we should focus on the two days that were ahead of us. Fortunately, the\
  \ hotel rooms were already paid for. The only cost that we would have to cover in\
  \ the next two days was that of food. We went to the nearest grocery store and bought\
  \ four packets of Parle-G \u2013 the cheapest biscuit available. That was to be\
  \ our food for the next 42 hours. \n\nThe next day we barely did anything worth\
  \ writing about. We were holed up in our room and a park nearby and did as little\
  \ physical activity as possible so as to not feel hungry. \n\nBut on the second\
  \ day, I just could not take it anymore. My stomach hurt when I fed it another biscuit.\
  \ Shraddha seemed to be doing alright. So, with a lot of guilt, I walked to a nearby\
  \ canteen, Druk Dawat, and ordered the cheapest food item over there \u2013 a Chicken\
  \ Thali (meal), which was for 170 Ngultrum. The food felt as if it was from another\
  \ world. Without a doubt, it was the best thing that I had eaten in my recent memory.\n\
  \nBut what transpired the next moment, when I was paying the bill at the cash counter,\
  \ made me go absolutely numb. \n\nI had given a 200 Ngultrum note to the polite\
  \ lady at the counter, and while returning my change, she was chatting up with a\
  \ man who was standing beside her. Assuming that I had given her a 1000 Ngultrum\
  \ note, she ended up returning 830 Ngultrum to me. A little shocked, I took the\
  \ money as quickly as I could and walked hurriedly towards the exit. A part of me\
  \ wanted to tell her about the mistake she had made. But I really needed that money\
  \ and as soon as I was out of there, I ran as fast as I could till I reached the\
  \ end of that street.\n\nWe used that money to buy our tickets and get to Jaigaon."
