Text: "As I continued my journey within the hills of north India, I found myself couple\
  \ of hours away from the town of my favourite author and storyteller - Ruskin Bond.\
  \ With nothing to have second thoughts on, I rushed to experience and explore Mussoorie.\
  \ Ruskin\u2019s Mussoorie.\n\nRuskin Bond to Mussoorie is what Gore Vidal and Robert\
  \ Wagner are to Amalfi Coast in Italy or Orhan Pamuk to the city of Istanbul. The\
  \ man, through his stories, has immortalised the magic and mystic of life in the\
  \ hills and this magnificently beautiful Himalayan town.\n\nA walk past the historic\
  \ Mall or Mall Road (as it\u2019s been called now), I gazed in wonder at the legendary\
  \ Picture Palace \u2013 one of the first cinema theater in Mussoorie. Although the\
  \ exterior was worn out, the old building still seemed to have a good number of\
  \ years left. And all of a sudden, within moments, characters and scenes from Mr\
  \ Bond\u2019s books were alive. It was as though I was transported to a different\
  \ time. There was dhoti-clad Bisnu and his friend Ahmed, characters from Mr Bond\u2019\
  s books, who were seen working at the newly opened Picture Palace. Back on the street,\
  \ the vegetable vendors were busy making a sale while a few fruit sellers had put\
  \ up seasons first cherry produce. Voices of people fervently discussing country\u2019\
  s future were heard from the tea stall nearby.  While from the corner of my eye,\
  \ I could see the record shop owner off the Mall was occupied with his latest repair\
  \ work. As I went ahead  few steps, the sweet shop was seen thronged with impatient\
  \ children who sought reward from their mothers\u2019 in the form a jalebi or gulab\
  \ jamun or condensed milk for being a good student at school. Overlooking the lush\
  \ backdrop of the Dehradun valley, these scenes played out.\n\nAn uphill stroll\
  \ to Landour, and the road got quieter. Amongst the curvaceous hills, I began an\
  \ attempt to locate the famous Pari Tibba (Hill of Fairies), where Mr Bond met with\
  \ little flying people. Wondered if Burnt Hill or Haunted hill still exist? And\
  \ if it does, is it still deserted because of the lightning the iron deposits used\
  \ to attract or has it now been bought off by people who have dealt with the issue.\
  \ Walking further, I tried to find the stream where Mr Bond and his friend, the\
  \ jungle leopard grew oddly comfortable in each other\u2019s presence. And where\
  \ young Ruskin met Biniya, the village girl he fell in love with.\n\nMussoorie has\
  \ surely changed over years'. A sight of concrete roads carved out over the hills\
  \ to make inroads for vehicular traffic, high street boutiques, souvenir and gift\
  \ shops, billboards hanging underneath the street lights, brightly coloured multi-cuisine\
  \ restaurants and cafes who are desperate to grab attention of the numerous tourists\
  \ who flock the place during summer and late winter, are bound to make your eyes\
  \ sore. Nevertheless, it\u2019s completely upto you on how you want to experience\
  \ and make a memory of this charming place. I made mine through a local connection\
  \ \u2013 Ruskin's tales\u2019. \n\n-------"
