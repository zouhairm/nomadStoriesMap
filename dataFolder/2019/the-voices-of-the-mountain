Text: "We went out of the small Edinburgh hostel before the sunrise. The dark and\
  \ slightly gloomy city was drowning in silence. Nothing could break this mysterious\
  \ calmness of the morning world. There were closed stores, empty road and just us\
  \ walking on the street. \n\nI still remember as after landing at the airport of\
  \ Edinburgh I offered to Natasha, \"Let's meet the dawn here tomorrow\". I do not\
  \ really know why these words dropped from my mouth. Seems like it was the inner\
  \ dream of mine. To meet the dawn - this is like to discover a new little life,\
  \ to experience millions of new chances. The city wakes up from its sleep, comes\
  \ to life, and you gain a new day that promises to be better than yesterday. Doing\
  \ it in an unknown city feels more exciting and somewhat adventurous. \n\nNow then,\
  \ we were walking along the dark deserted streets navigating around the map and\
  \ trying not to get lost. Nobody was around, and only our grating voices broke this\
  \ deafening silence of the sleeping city. We were heading to high hill called \u201C\
  Arthur's Seat\u201D, on top of which we supposed to see the sunrise. I remember\
  \ how cheerfully we discussed our journey, imagined how brave we would go to the\
  \ top of this mountain, and what beautiful views we would have. Small islands of\
  \ trees replaced buildings, and then houses completely disappeared from our sight.\
  \ \n\nHere we are at the foot of the hill! \n\nA motionless chain of clouds enveloped\
  \ the top of the mountain, so only the imagination could draw some various fanciful\
  \ shapes. \nWe began our ascent. Having left special tourist trails, we got lost\
  \ in numerous paths, narrow and stony. As time went on, it began to get light. Meanwhile\
  \ we were still about half way to the top. I already began to regret about this\
  \ whole idea: cold wind, beating straight in the face, morning dew, soaking through\
  \ our shoes and a thick white mist, due to which the sun was not visible - all of\
  \ that terribly spoiled the impression of our walk. \"Let's go back\" - I kept these\
  \ words on my mind making next little step up. \"It is better to find a cafe and\
  \ enjoy hot coffee\", I thought, \"Nothing will happen, we won\u2019t see the sun\
  \ in this hopeless fog\". I was close to give up, but something inside still pushed\
  \ me forward. Stubbornness in front of an unfulfilled thing, resentment due to an\
  \ early rise or hope that it will still get better. I do not know. We just kept\
  \ on going.\n\nReaching the peak, we saw only a white veil, through which the outlines\
  \ of buildings and lanterns were faintly visible...\n\nThis one could be a sad end\
  \ of the story, but no! Standing up there, we suddenly heard loud voices, like the\
  \ voices of the mountain, covering the whole \"Arthur's Seat\". It literally paralyzed\
  \ us. It was incredibly beautiful. As if all the sounds of the world had merged\
  \ into one melody, it enveloped us from head to toe and lifted us closer to heaven.\
  \ We suddenly found ourselves not at the foggy top of the ordinary hill, but high\
  \ in the clouds, above the whole city, above the whole world. I was afraid to sigh,\
  \ move, even close my eyes - seemed like one single movement would have destroy\
  \ this divine melody. However, it still sounded: louder, quieter, faster and slower.\
  \ The wind raging on the top only added inspirational strength and firmness to musical\
  \ modulations. Soon the sound went out and there were many different voices of ordinary\
  \ girls and boys somewhere close to us. They sang! Chorus! They were staying a bit\
  \ lower than we were and singing beautiful, charming song. How they got there, why\
  \ these people sang on the top of the mountain during the dawn, what the name of\
  \ this song they performed - I still do not know the answers to these questions.\
  \ Nevertheless, thanks to their voices, voices of the mountain, I met the most beautiful\
  \ sunrise in my life.\n\nWhen Natasha and I went back down, the city was already\
  \ awake. \n\nWe were walking in silence."
