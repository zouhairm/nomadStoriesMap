Text: "Considering my passport was filled with ink, I was surprised with the immediate\
  \ culture shock that I felt entering Hanoi. It was buzzing. Motor scooters hurtled\
  \ past me in all directions, whole families clinging to their tiny metal frames.\
  \ I remember making eye contact with a small boy who smiled as he whizzed past,\
  \ barely grasping the back of his mother\u2019s pink shirt as she herself clutched\
  \ a swaddled newborn to her chest.\n\n\tThe buildings had each developed their own\
  \ unique patina, once painted green or gold, their paint flaked off so that each\
  \ structure became a collage of colour. Black electrical wires shattered the sky\
  \ and snaked across streets, so matted and tangled that the entire city seemed one\
  \ big electrical hazard, ready to bloom crimson at a moment\u2019s notice. It\u2019\
  s no wonder then that Hanoi felt as if it was always emitting sparks. \n\n\tMy family\
  \ and I had a local guide, a man with a round face, large smile and kind eyes. His\
  \ name was Ha and he laughed often, loud and wide, pushing plates of spicy street\
  \ pigeon toward us to try. \u201CFor fun!\u201D he\u2019d exclaim, before crunching\
  \ the black bird beak first into his grinning mouth. He\u2019d take us deep into\
  \ the city, down narrowing side streets that stretched out like mazes. He\u2019\
  d chat with locals, introducing us so that they\u2019d offer a smoke from their\
  \ large communal pipes, and we stopped at curb-side markets to sample fruits I didn\u2019\
  t even know existed. Dark plum-coloured mangosteen, their insides white and sweet,\
  \ and spiny pink rambutan that looked like they\u2019d been plucked from some tropical\
  \ reef. In small covered squares we\u2019d find the meat markets, where farmers\
  \ and butchers rented concrete slabs to lay out their cuts. \u201CThe later in the\
  \ day, the cheaper the meat,\u201D Ha told us and we needn\u2019t ask why. The suffocating\
  \ heat and humidity settled over everything here and the market carried the overwhelming\
  \ scent of flesh festering in the July sun. \n\n\tOver the next couple of days we\u2019\
  d learn more about the Vietnamese people, how they loved karaoke and played jianzi\
  \ (a form of hacky sack) at sunset by the lake. We also learned about Vietnam\u2019\
  s difficult history\u2014it was referred to as the American War here\u2014and the\
  \ past still hung over the country heavy like a quilt. One of Ha\u2019s dreams was\
  \ actually to visit the U.S, a dream he knew would probably never come true due\
  \ to Vietnam\u2019s strict entry and exit laws. The truth of that fact disarmed\
  \ him and it was the only time we saw him look small and delicate, his smile wiped\
  \ clean from his face.\n\n\tOver the next month, we\u2019d meet many others like\
  \ Ha around South East Asia, guides who\u2019d had their dreams crushed by corruption.\
  \ One told us how he\u2019d studied tirelessly to become a lawyer, investing all\
  \ of his money in his education, but when it had come time to take his bar exam\u2014\
  which he\u2019d passed with flying colours\u2014the officiators told him they\u2019\
  d fail him if he didn\u2019t pay up. By that point, there was no more money left.\n\
  \n\tOn our last day in Hanoi, Ha told us about the place he\u2019d grown up in,\
  \ a tiny rural village that only got electricity in his late teens. He remembered\
  \ when his family received a single lightbulb and how he\u2019d sat in front of\
  \ it for hours, staring at the otherworldly light in awe. The first time he arrived\
  \ in Hanoi he\u2014like me\u2014felt his own type of culture shock, overwhelmed\
  \ by the electric city which seemed to operate at double speed. \u201CMy first day\
  \ in Hanoi I stood on one street corner for four hours just watching,\u201D he\u2019\
  d said. \n\n\tWe were connected in that way. I\u2019d felt similar, for many reasons\
  \ different from Ha and for many that were the same. I\u2019ve stood in the middle\
  \ of Times Square as throngs of people looked up in wonder, I\u2019ve marveled as\
  \ vehicles zigzagged through each other on the roundabouts of Rome, but no place\
  \ has ever made me stop like Hanoi. No place has ever pulled my senses in every\
  \ direction all at once."
