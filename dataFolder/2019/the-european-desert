Text: "When I heard the name Bordeaux, the first thought that came to mind was the\
  \ wine. A strong, independent powerhouse disguised in architectural beauty and cute\
  \ tourist restaurants; a warehouse that made wine as quick and as elegantly as it\
  \ was poured, ready to be drank all around the world. When my colleagues suggested\
  \ going to Bordeaux for the public holiday, a chance to go on holiday without the\
  \ cost of a last-minute flight, I agreed wholeheartedly, thinking that, at the very\
  \ least, it was an opportunity to broaden my knowledge of French culture during\
  \ my year abroad. I never thought that it would change my perspective of France\
  \ entirely. \n\nFrance has a policy with most workers where public holidays, if\
  \ they fell on a Thursday, the workers could get \"bridge days\", meaning that the\
  \ Friday is also considered a holiday to go straight to the weekend. We were confident\
  \ then that we had enough time to really enjoy ourselves. We had decided to travel\
  \ by bus for the cost: 4 hours sitting side-by-side with complete strangers, awkwardly\
  \ smiling as we reach for the USB plugs, illuminated in the dark, to charge our\
  \ phones and pass the time. It passed slowly. I can never sleep on public transport,\
  \ which is an absolute tragedy for someone who loves to travel, so I gazed out through\
  \ the window as the road rolled on, watching as the morning dawned. When we arrived,\
  \ it was almost the afternoon: booked into the hotel and we were ready to go. \n\
  \nAside from the popular wine museum and the beautiful buildings surrounding the\
  \ city, just outside is a place called Dune de Pilat, commonly referred to as the\
  \ tallest sand dune in Europe. A train ticket bought on a bored impulse at the station\
  \ and a bus, driven by a friendly yet terrifyingly racer-like conductor. We were\
  \ there.  \n\nDriving in, my first impression was that of a forest you'd find back\
  \ in Britain. Some sand already on the ground, the path curved deep inside the trees,\
  \ and immediately the sweet taste of the sea hit us. The wind was cold, but the\
  \ walk through the forest to the dunes soon warmed us up. We climbed and turned\
  \ through the path until the opening greeted us and we were engulfed by yellow.\
  \ It was as though someone had replaced the Welsh mountains with the same quantity\
  \ of sand, stacked just as high and just as breathtakingly beautiful. Everyone climbed\
  \ up, some choosing the safe path of stairs and rope, while the more daring of us\
  \ climbed up the sand. It slipped and rolled under my shoes, my knees threatened\
  \ to buckle. Children around my dove in and rolled, playing and laughing as if the\
  \ drop wasn't the same as a tower. I kept going, right up to the top, where there\
  \ was the view of a lifetime:\n\nGone 4 pm, the sun was beginning to settle into\
  \ the coast, burning red and orange across the boats that sat nicely on the thin\
  \ blue line. The dunes rose and fell with the sunbeams, trawling down on one side\
  \ to the ocean and, on the other, to the great forests that we had come through.\
  \ The wind was furious, blowing and howling, but the sunset caressed our cheeks.\
  \ My mouth was open in awe for I don't know how long. It was perfect. Magical. My\
  \ camera resting around my neck, fingertips fluttering over the buttons, I couldn't\
  \ help but stop and stare. \n\nAnd now, when I hear the name Bordeaux, I think of\
  \ the Dune de Pilat. I think of the European Desert."
