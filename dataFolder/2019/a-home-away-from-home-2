Text: "Let me take you on a journey to a place I've come to call home. When I got\
  \ the call that is be traveling to my dream destination, I screamed so loud my neighbors\
  \ heard me. This has been a dream of mine since I was 10 and that dream was finally\
  \ becoming a reality 12 years later.\n\nOn the plane to my all-time favorite South\
  \ American country, all I could think was \"this is really happening. I'm literally\
  \ living my dream this summer.\"\n\nWhen we landed, I was so excited to be I'm what\
  \ I came to call second home that I left my iPhone on the plane. Did I care? Not\
  \ one bit because Id just landed in Rio De Janeiro. THE RIO DE JANEIRO! The state\
  \ where football thrived, beaches were always packed, and everyone loved to dance.\
  \ The state of my favorite football team, Brazil National team (Sele\xE7\xE3o),\
  \ and the country of my all-time favorite footballer Neymar.\n\nI have a tendency\
  \ to make places my own when I'm there and that's just what I did, I made Rio my\
  \ own, to the point where I was thought of to be a real Brasileiro. Of course, I\
  \ was there doing a film project with my Gringos (white Americans) but on my days\
  \ off, I was living as the Cariocas do, beaching it, watching football in bars,\
  \ Samba dancing in night clubs, and just living life without a care in the world.\n\
  \nI had the time of my life over in Rio, but something happened that I never expected.\
  \ I found a new version of myself that I never knew existed. This version was bold\
  \ to the point where it was scary. This version would flirt with you one second\
  \ then act like you don't exist the next. This version knew how to speak Portuguese\
  \ like a local and get things accomplished. This version was everything I wanted\
  \ to be but was too afraid to. I liked this version of me. I call it \"The Rio Version\"\
  \ because it only came out while in Rio. Before I got there and after I left, I\
  \ never saw her.\n\nRio was also a place of a lot of firsts for me. The first time\
  \ I had P\xE3o de Quejo, which became my favorite meal. My first time going to a\
  \ club and a bar, my first time surfing, jumping off a boat, partying on a beach,\
  \ etc. A lot of firsts, but there's one first I'll always remember and that would\
  \ be the first time I fell in love with photography. I've always liked photography\
  \ but never to the point where I wanted to go to school for it or make a career\
  \ of it. Rio taught me how to capture precious moments in a way no class, professor,\
  \ or other destination has. I now go everywhere with my camera because of the precious\
  \ moments waiting to be captured. \n\nThank you, Rio De Janeiro, for opening a door\
  \ to my future. I will never forget that experience and that is why I call Rio my\
  \ second home. It's a place of peace with so many opportunities waiting for me.\
  \ I can't wait to go back home. Soon, Rio, soon."
