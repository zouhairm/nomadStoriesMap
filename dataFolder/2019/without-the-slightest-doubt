Text: "I really do not know why, but who travels, there are stories to tell.\nWillingness\
  \ to travel has existed in me since I understood myself by people. The photos of\
  \ the places fascinated me and I remember clearly that the first time I saw a pyramid\
  \ - in the book in a history lesson, I was sure I needed to get to know that place.\n\
  A little earlier, I took advantage of the holidays, which did not take me to florida\
  \ or Europe, but allowed me to enjoy the \"travel ritual\" even though it was only\
  \ 160km away from home. I valued a lot, that backpacking, waking up earlier, preparing\
  \ some things to eat on the way and the commotion inside the bus that my brothers\
  \ and I knew how to do.\nThere was the expectation of living on vacation. There\
  \ were holiday buddies, holiday food, holiday clothes all seemed different to me\
  \ at that time. And to understand, perhaps, the reason for my passion for travel,\
  \ we always stayed in my mother's house where my mother's younger sister also lived.\n\
  My aunt ... well, she traveled as much as she can in her youth. Then came some health\
  \ problems and today she still packs up the cases for another.\nThe photos of the\
  \ few trips that she managed to make me marvel and like her I already knew that\
  \ I wanted to do that: to have many pictures in several places and lots of story\
  \ to tell!\n2011 was the year that I finally understood that I had to see the world\
  \ with my own eyes and despite the various cons that appeared on the way, I hit\
  \ my foot, being stubborn that I know I am by nature and stuck my foot in the road.\n\
  It was my first trip all around the world. There were 50 very intense days started\
  \ in Greece and ending in Portugal. A trajectory of which, yes, I am very proud.\
  \ For what I lived and for the friends I made.\nI think trips are about this: living\
  \ and people to know.\nAnd it was precisely for this reason, because I was \"wandering\"\
  \ around the world, that my trip was for me an unparalleled gift ... of infinite\
  \ learning, great friendships, pleasant and pleasant surprises, self-knowledge,\
  \ and a love affair with the freedom that you rarely get.\nThe problem / solution\
  \ (it will depend on each one), is that this - being a traveler - addicts ... to\
  \ me, without a doubt! I take my addiction and escape the therapies that do not\
  \ give me as a solution to leave! The go! The nod of until soon.\nIn 2011, on my\
  \ first trip to Europe alone, I had the good fortune to make eternal friendships,\
  \ to meet incredible places and to get myself into a lot of confusion: to a possible\
  \ disagreement with the human traffic mafia! Still, from the Acropolis to the Tower\
  \ of Bel\xE9m, interspersed with bike rides in Florence, dancing nights in Barcelona,\
  \ \u200B\u200Bgreen bananas in Paris and a near night in the open in Vienna I was\
  \ the happiest backpacker in the world. And I daresay without a doubt!"
