Text: "We met as strangers near the train station on the outskirts of Budapest.  Nikolasz\
  \ was his name, and we were expecting company on this shortest day of the year,\
  \ winter solstice.  Snowflakes were falling lightly, but the ground was yet to be\
  \ smothered white.  Christmas markets were scattered throughout the city however,\
  \ it was not markets or the city we would explore today.  We were off to encounter\
  \ the heart chakra of the earth, Dobog\xF3k\u0151.\n\nKatalina and her young son\
  \ Milan arrived just minutes later, and introductions were made.  No longer strangers,\
  \ we piled into Nikolasz \u2019s car, ready for an adventure!  My new companions\
  \ were all of Hungarian descent, and I hailed from the South Pacific on the other\
  \ side of the world.  For the adults, English was our common language, but little\
  \ Milan didn\u2019t understand a word, so Hungarian was spoken too.\n\nWe arrived\
  \ ready to explore this pilgrimage site of the Hungarian neopagans also known as\
  \ the T\xE1ltos.  It was they who believe this site to be the heart chakra of the\
  \ earth.  At first glimpse, it was breathtaking, my first ever experience of a frozen\
  \ forest!  There was a slight sprinkling of snow that covered the forest floor,\
  \ but it was the stunning white trees that turned this place into the most spectacular\
  \ winter wonderland.  It seemed all but a dream, straight out of a fairy tale.\n\
  \nNikolasz and Katalina muttered away in Hungarian as Milan and I tag along behind\
  \ in awkward silence.   Milan must have been all of about nine and probably wondering\
  \ what this strange English sounding woman was all about.  How I longed to understand\
  \ what he was thinking of this whole experience.\n\nBefore we knew it, the track\
  \ became not so apparent and eventually, we became a little lost.  Trusting Nikolasz,\
  \ because we really had no choice, our adventure became a scramble through icy bushes\
  \ following a fence line up the hill and hoping it would reach a road sooner or\
  \ later.  And of course it did, so no harm done.\n\nUpon returning to the car, Nikolasz\
  \ brought up the idea of attending a traditional ritual, a winter solstice gathering\
  \ that he had heard about but didn\u2019t really have much information on.  Katalina\
  \ was eager to get home with Milan, it had been a long day for him already, and\
  \ so they departed by bus back to the city.\n\nTo stay with Nikolasz was an easy\
  \ decision, I hadn\u2019t come halfway around the world not to make the most of\
  \ every opportunity bestowed upon me.  Caution did pop into my mind and warn me\
  \ that I was about to head off into the night was someone I had only met that day\
  \ to a strange place in the middle of nowhere.  But my instinct had never let me\
  \ down, and tonight it was telling me this was a great idea, that another adventure\
  \ was to be had.\n\nUpon arrival we stepped out of the car to unbelievably freezing\
  \ conditions, it was pitch black, and we couldn\u2019t see more than ten feet in\
  \ front of us.  A small fire danced in the distance which lead us in the direction\
  \ we needed to go. Somewhere along the way, we stumbled upon the monastery ruins,\
  \ broken brick walls scattered in all directions.  With only a headlight to guide\
  \ the way, it was hard to take in what must have been a truly unique sight.\n\n\
  It was an approachable crowd we joined, strangers to us both and not a word of English\
  \ to be heard.  Nikolasz made inquiries and discovered that the group would embark\
  \ on a long two-hour journey through the bush before returning to light the large\
  \ bonfire assembled beside us.  It must have been close to minus ten Celsius, and\
  \ after our earlier adventure, we both agreed we didn\u2019t need to spend the next\
  \ few hours in a freezing cold dark forest.  We honestly thought they were all crazy!\
  \  So into a nice warm car we climbed, and Nikolasz drove us back to the gracious\
  \ city lights of Budapest."
