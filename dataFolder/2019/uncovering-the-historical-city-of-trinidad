Text: "Dance, music and good food - in this magical city surrounded by mountains and\
  \ the Caribbean Sea even a state-owned restaurant can become an attraction. On one\
  \ side the beautiful mountains of Valle de los Ingenios and on the other the Caribbean\
  \ beach Playa Ancon, it is no wonder that the small and astonishing historical city\
  \ of Trinidad, that celebrates 505 years in 2019, located in the province of Sancti\
  \ Spiritus, Cuba, has been recognized by UNESCO as a World Heritage site.\n    \
  \        For a traveler who wants to get to know cubans exploring the city center\
  \ - which has more than six museums, an open-air Casa de la M\xFAsica, whose staircase\
  \ is filled with cubans and foreigners, and a Casa de la Trova (music and dance\
  \ centers that are common in most cuban cities) - will already be pretty exciting.\
  \ Besides these handsome places, what's more charming about Trinidad is that between\
  \ its cobbled and uneven streets, typical of colonial cities, you can always find\
  \ locals playing songs or just smoking a cuban cigar, usually available for a nice\
  \ chat or even just a warm smile exchange. Sharing those moments with the relaxed\
  \ and nice people from Cuba was certainty adorable. Of course, also worthy of mention\
  \ are the city's art galleries, where frequently the artist itself will greet you,\
  \ the bars with mojitos and salsa and its countless private houses, where cubans\
  \ live and tourists stay as super well treated guests. \n            So arriving\
  \ in Trinidad - which by the way was the only definite destination for the 12-day\
  \ trip to Cuba - the discovery began by pedaling from the city center to Playa Ancon.\
  \ On the road there were beautiful cars of the 50's (in their best shape), horses\
  \ and scooters sharing the highway. For sure this was the ideal backdrop for that\
  \ 29 Celsius degrees winter afternoon, specially when arriving at a stunning beach,\
  \ with bathtub-warm water and fine white sand. Not even the one single and expensive\
  \ restaurant that served only two dishes out of eight that were described on the\
  \ menu (what is typical in Cuba, especially in the coastal region) could be a problem\
  \ - and to avoid that I would recommend you to take snacks for your rides. By the\
  \ end of the day, the return to Trinidad came together with a painted sunset sky\
  \ that suddenly reflected at an unexpected crystal clear lake. And that was the\
  \ perfect timing to return, not only on account of its beauty but also because at\
  \ night there were few lights on the road and the beach gets infested by mosquitoes\
  \ \u2013 so if you are going to Cuba, don't forget to bring a bug repellent.\n \
  \           Winter is not much different from summer in Trinidad - and Cuba - where\
  \ it has little temperature variation. Therefore, the streets boil at night as people\
  \ move to Casa de la Musica and nearby discos. On my way downtown a delicious bread\
  \ smell caught my attention and I surprisingly found a peaceful residents queue\
  \ at Trinidad's bakery around 10 pm waiting for the batches of bread. Another pleasant\
  \ cuban surprise.\n            Just beyond that bakery is Plaza Mayor, and two blocks\
  \ away the famous La Botija, Trinidad's most renowned state-owned restaurant. Indeed,\
  \ waiting for the 45 minute line was worth every second. While sipping a delicious\
  \ shrimp al ajillo a local band started playing animated cuban songs in the middle\
  \ of the restaurant. In a matter of ten minutes people were in the main hall of\
  \ La Botija dancing among with almost all the waiters and waitresses, the security\
  \ guard, some cooks and at least a third of the customers. Who wasn't dancing was\
  \ clapping, singing, and no doubt having fun (including me). The show lasted for\
  \ another 20 minutes, when the band ended its participation (after the bis begged\
  \ by the public) and everyone went back to their tables to eat that tasty food they\
  \ were nicely serving. It is definitely this type of magic present in human relationships\
  \ and awakened by local people, which is particularly alive in Trinidad, that generates\
  \ the joy and fulfillment one seek the most when traveling. And make you feel like\
  \ going back."
