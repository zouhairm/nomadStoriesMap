Text: "Paying the man at the door 10 Euro, I made my way down the dusty steps into\
  \ a world unknown. Jazz crept up the walls and into my ears, lifting me down, down,\
  \ down into the cave below. As I sideled up to the bar, I improperly asked for a\
  \ beer in French. The bartender giggled as the words tumbled out as jumbled nonsense\
  \ from my lips. I blushed and muttered the only word I truly knew, \u201Cmerci\u201D\
  , and took my drink with me to where the music called. I found a seat close enough\
  \ to the band, but far enough where I could observe without question. My toes tapped\
  \ along to the beat, and a smile grew wide across my face as I watched the couples\
  \ stumble this way and that, twirling, sweating, laughing, blushing. As I sipped\
  \ from my beer, I watched as an elderly man asked a much younger woman to dance.\
  \ She accepted, and his age became but a number. He twirled her around the floor\
  \ as if he had the body of a twenty year old, dipping her and gliding across the\
  \ floor as if it were his god given talent. Once their dance was done, I decided\
  \ I wanted to give a crack at it, have the old man take me for a spin. Neither of\
  \ us spoke each other\u2019s language, but did it matter? Well perhaps it should\
  \ have, because it turns out that dancing is not my god given gift. Instead of the\
  \ magical performance I had witnessed earlier, we side stepped across the floor\
  \ in an almost ogre-like way, me trying not to step on his toes, and him scolding\
  \ me for being off beat. However, once I found my rhythm he decided that once more\
  \ he had found his feet, and we danced across the floor as if it were just the two\
  \ of us - or maybe I thought this way because everyone else was trying to get out\
  \ of my clumsy way? We danced together through multiple songs, until my feet grew\
  \ tired and my beer glass started to sweat. I again thanked him with the only French\
  \ word I knew, and he kissed my hand to say au revoir. As I emerged from the cave\
  \ bar steps a while later, I smiled up at the stars and thought to myself, I will\
  \ always remember this night as one of the best nights in Paris."
