Text: "\u201CMagazin! Magazin!\u201D\n\u201CAaah, right ok! Cool!\u201D...\nI had\
  \ no idea. A place where you pick up the local magazine? Actually, not far off and\
  \ thanks to that trip, I now know it might be a useful word if your looking for\
  \ a small, basic store in Ukraine. \n\nSo \u2018Magzin!\u2019 is amongst my strongest\
  \ of memories from the whole trip (a moneyless hitch hiking adventure from Georgia\
  \ through Turkey, Bulgaria, Romania, Ukraine, Poland, Czech, Austria, Italy, France\
  \ and England all the way down to Cornwall in the south west), which is a lot of\
  \ memories to chose from. The words just seem to ring in my head. It could be for\
  \ any reason from some link with my childhood to the constant referral to that place.\
  \ I\u2019d like to believe it\u2019s becuase of those two crazy little village boys\
  \ and their sisters that occasionally passed by.\n\nFrom understanding a few basic\
  \ words and gesturing like crazy animals, we managed to exchange age, name, amount\
  \ of siblings, sports we like and well, the list goes on. Me, a 21 year old English\
  \ boy and a 9 and 10 year old from close to Reni, Ukraine hit it off like best of\
  \ friends. I guess we were both exited by the rarity of our exchange.\n\n\u201C\
  Waaah! Ahaha...\u201D. That\u2019s another beautiful moment from them. Their eyes\
  \ lit up as I showed them a magic trick I learnt from my little brother. They loved\
  \ it!\nI only did it becuase I felt I had to give something to these generous little\
  \ fellows. They were funny no doubt, but it was their genouristy that made me stand\
  \ in amazement the most. They even ran and brought me a snack from the \u2018Magazin\u2019\
  \ with their pocket money. Maybe that\u2019s why I remember it!\n\nThinking about\
  \ it gives me such a joy! Such a team, we were. We were stopping cars together to\
  \ get me a ride, playing with tennis balls on a string, dancing, throwing each other\
  \ (I was throwing them) in the air... And I\u2019m certain that the ride I got was\
  \ all thanks to them. \n\nPart of me wanted to stay. To get stuck there between\
  \ our messy commutation and random fun, learn Ukrainian and ride around the village\
  \ with them! Maybe elsewhere that has happened and we are still there having fun.\n\
  \nBut I left, to head to my next adventures, running to the truck shouting \u2018\
  thank you! Spasiba! Dziakuje!\u2019. Trying English, Russian and Ukrainian hoping\
  \ one was right and at least one would communicate my gratitude for our time.\n\n\
  So there it was, over. But what a beautiful welcoming it was.\nNot long after I\
  \ found myself sitting. Alone, for the first time in a long time. Waiting again.\
  \ Reflecting on them, and those before it. Wow it was powerful! It\u2019s powerful\
  \ still. That longing feeling to share. Sat alone wishing to share the warmth given\
  \ along the way.\n\nFrom this point I stopped saying \u201CI made it to...\u201D\
  \ and started saying \u201Cwe made it to...\u201D. We being the team of the world.\
  \ This crazy big old beautiful world."
