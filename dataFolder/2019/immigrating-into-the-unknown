Text: "Crossing international borders has always seemed fascinating for me. At times\
  \ you simply arrive, collect your bags and get a taxi. Sometimes you end up in endless\
  \ formalities and checks. Every country has its own way of welcoming you to their\
  \ country. I tend to find the whole idea of political borders very philosophical.\
  \ You cross an imaginary line on the map \u2013 and it checks off a country from\
  \ your bucket list. Not quite true, right? \n\nI know it sounds quite impossible\
  \ \u2013 but I simply wish if this world existed without political borders. Possible?\n\
  \nMaybe in the next life. Maybe in a parallel universe. \nWe hope.\n \nOne of the\
  \ most interesting experiences on border crossing I came across was during a visit\
  \ to Democratic People's Republic of Korea \u2013 also called as DPRK or North Korea.\
  \  This \u2018hermit\u2019 country, as they say - is secluded from rest of the world.\
  \ It is one of those countries in the world that infamously maintains political\
  \ and military tensions with some of the most powerful nations. Their tourism is\
  \ state owned, and as a tourist you will be chaperoned by handlers and guides throughout\
  \ your stay in the country.\n \nWe chose to take a train from China to enter DPRK.\
  \ As the train left Dandong (China) and crossed the Yalu river, we entered DPRK.\
  \ The train halted at the Sinuiju station for customs check and immigration formalities.\
  \ In my opinion, I will probably never get to experience such a unique immigration\
  \ process ever in my life.\n\nThe immigration and customs checks were executed within\
  \ the train. No passenger is allowed to move from their seats. The uniformed DPRK\
  \ officers performed the required checks for every passenger at their seats \u2013\
  \ one by one. It took a long time. The empty railway station, a train packed with\
  \ passengers and no one moving around except uniformed guards, baggage being opened\
  \ and scanned \u2013 all this added up to make us slightly nervous. \n\nA form was\
  \ provided. We were asked to list down all electronic items, books or any other\
  \ religious/art materials with us. A guard appeared. Checked out our form and requested\
  \ to point to our luggage. Each bag of ours gets checked meticulously. Cameras,\
  \ phones, memory cards, hard-disks, laptops were randomly scanned for their contents.\
  \ Nothing was exempted. Not even our 3-year old\u2019s toys and books. Did I mention\
  \ that he travelled with us for this adventure? This young tourist turned a lot\
  \ of heads there!\n\nThe immigration and customs check took a long 90 minutes. And\
  \ then passengers could step out of the train. But this freedom had boundaries.\
  \ The expectation is not to move more than a few meters away from the door of the\
  \ coach you are sitting in. The curiosity in me took me a little further, and there\
  \ was a gruff \u2018AYE!\u2019 from a distant guard. I hastily walked back into\
  \ the train and took my seat. You would not want to get into the bad books of a\
  \ North Korean guard.\n\nJust when the train was about to move, a guard came in\
  \ and signaled us specifically to pick our bags and come out. Our nervousness set\
  \ in again. Neither my wife or I speak Korean. And we were not sure if we could\
  \ ask a \u2018why?\u2019. We reluctantly complied and were shifted to another coach,\
  \ thinking of the possible reasons on this sudden decision by the officers.\n\n\
  As we settled ourselves at our newly allotted seats, we looked around. There were\
  \ barely 20 other passengers in the entire coach, and we were placed at the very\
  \ end of the coach \u2013 away from everyone else. The only family in the train?\
  \ The only Indians in the entire train?  And not part of a travel group? To this\
  \ day, we are still not sure what was the idea behind shifting us to a different\
  \ coach. \n\nFinally, the train moved. We were relieved. The fact that the train\
  \ resumed its journey and we were in it - indicated that our immigration was cleared.\
  \ Our passports did not have any arrival stamps though.\n\nAs the train chugged,\
  \ we moved deeper into this unknown land.\nWith each passing minute.\nWith each\
  \ passing mile."
