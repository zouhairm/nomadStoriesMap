Text: "Subhead: A wilderness hike that left permanent tracks\n\nBetween the countries\
  \ of Ghana and Togo is the lush, mountain view from the top of west Africa's highest\
  \ waterfall. With a vast, hazy sky above miles of rich forest blanketing the Agumatsa\
  \ Range, our two and a half hour vertical trek to the upper falls of Wli was both\
  \ physically and visually breathtaking. Our Ghanaian trail guide points out to the\
  \ distant scenery, saying it consists of Togo's neighboring countries Benin and\
  \ Nigeria. \n\nYet, standing at this peak and surrounded by the scent of tropical\
  \ greenery and humid air, it all appears like one large, united part of the landscape.\
  \ \n\nVisiting Ghana as a volunteer farmer, the experience of staying in a village\
  \ was much more up close. \n\nAbout three hours from Ghana's capital city, Accra,\
  \ the Frankadua village resembles many in the Volta region that rely on rain for\
  \ fresh water and personal farms for food,  but unique qualities in the culture\
  \ and the people are also found. Like the village seamster, who sews yards of colorful\
  \ fabrics printed with ancient tribal Adinkra symbols, into a top, loose pants or\
  \ dress. Or the woman known for her late night noodles; packaged ramen available\
  \ cooked by hand with spices in an iron pot and small open flame outside her stone\
  \ and mud-made home for teenagers and children awake after dark. The football field,\
  \ known in the U.S. as soccer, was another evening spot to socialize for youth,\
  \ where the croaks of tree frogs in the nearby brush echoed over any mischief. \n\
  \nIn the Frankadua community, boundaries among the homes and the families of the\
  \ village are scant. Partly due to the close proximity of each home to another,\
  \ but also due to the fence-less spaces, shared clothes lines and unmarked paths\
  \ around each home's plot of dirt, swept clean each morning at sunrise. \n\nWaking\
  \ at sunrise to begin labor for the day was essential, especially if working on\
  \ the farm. It was only a limited time before the temperature reached it's average\
  \ 80 degrees in September. With the machete lent to me by the local farming program\
  \ manager names Joe, the morning walk to the farm took an average twenty-five therapeutic\
  \ minutes. \n\nWith most family and village farms located in the hills on the edges\
  \ of the village, I strolled between village homes, past the schools and chapel,\
  \ onto thin, dirt trails lined with tall grass fields on either side. Flies swirled\
  \ over my head as small, stray dogs tagged along, following my footsteps, but only\
  \ until reaching a dip in the path opening up to a nearly knee-high swampy pond.\
  \ \n\nMy rubber, periwinkle rain boots covered my legs just enough as I carefully\
  \ waded across the small pond to the other side, where the land steepens up toward\
  \ the hills again. If they owned a pair, most of the boots worn by the male farmers\
  \ were black or dark green. By the time I'd return from the farm for a breakfast\
  \ of scrambled eggs with cassava fries or thick, crepe like pancakes with peanut\
  \ butter and jelly, the children always made a point to comment on my boots' stand-out\
  \ color. \n\nNone the less, the boots did their job as I picked red chili peppers\
  \ and eggplants, fed the two large hogs from their wooden pen, and learned how to\
  \ sow corn by hand. The few hours or so I spent farming each morning, accompanied\
  \ by Joe, surrounded me with distant landscape gifting the same lush views of trees\
  \ and brush of neighboring hills, as I saw on top of Wli waterfall. \n\nFrom those\
  \ routine, daily farm walks to the hours of hiking miles up and down Wli, eventually\
  \ coming back home to the states felt a lot less distant that one would imagine.\
  \ Because somehow, the time spent traveling across country borders and overseas,\
  \ the imprint it makes on any nomad or volunteer doesn't disappear. The experiences\
  \ and the memories are the parts of travel that remain. \n\nAnd, just like the vast\
  \ scenery I looked out upon standing between Togo and Ghana, those parts are what\
  \ begin to feel like one, united part of you."
