Text: "While spending our last day in India, my husband and I stopped to have a late\
  \ lunch at a corner cafe.  It was crowded, hot, and all I wanted was naan and curry.\n\
  We ended up getting our lunch and managed to find a dirty, empty table directly\
  \ in the midday sunshine.  We carefully sat at the hot metal table.\n We were enjoying\
  \ the sights, sounds, and smells of Bangalore while devouring our lunch.  As I looked\
  \ up from my meal, a lady and her daughter started eyeing the two empty chairs at\
  \ our table.  I happily invited them to sit.  The mother and daughter quietly ate\
  \ their shared meal.\nWhen their plate was nearly empty, the daughter started eyeing\
  \ the leftover naan on my tray.  She kept looking to her nearly empty plate, then\
  \ back to my naan.  She then looked at me, then her mother.  I smiled and she reached\
  \ over and grabbed the naan from my tray!  I literally laughed out loud.  Her mother\
  \ looked over, realized what happened, and looked at me with shock and embarrassment.\
  \  I smiled at her, and we laughed together.  All the while, her daughter was happily\
  \ scraping the leftover curry off her tray with my naan. \n It was a great meal."
