Text: "I didn\u2019t expect to find myself sitting in Hong Kong staring out at the\
  \ rain as my mum slept in the room next door, alone. This trip was to celebrate\
  \ her 60th wedding anniversary. I find myself reminiscing.\n\nAs we hitched our\
  \ caravan to the back of our FJ Holden we had little regard for how a sedan would\
  \ manage the 10 000 km journey, heading north along the Western Australian coast,\
  \ through the red centre and over to Northern Queensland.\n\nWe were crazy poms\
  \ who had recently immigrated and had decided to travel where there were very few\
  \ sealed roads, using paper maps. The internet was a thing of the future. This was\
  \ a three month family vacation and a journey to find our new home. We were home\
  \ schooled as we went.\n\nWindscreens were made of glass in those days and a wire\
  \ cage folded up to protect us from the stones that flew up as huge road trains\
  \ screamed past. Mum would hold her hand up against the glass just in case, to stop\
  \ the shattered windscreen showering us should a rock get through. One day it did.\
  \ Mum wore gloves after that and we continued on for hours with the wind blowing\
  \ in our faces until the next town. Sometimes with broken springs and flat tyres\
  \ we soldiered on. Limping into one horse towns, thankful for Aussie mateship as\
  \ we were patched up and continued on our way.\n\nSomehow we had developed a love\
  \ of skin diving and spearfishing as we camped on the beaches and caught our dinner.\
  \ Swimming with the sharks in Shark Bay seemed normal to us. In the middle of nowhere\
  \ in the Northern Territory we swam among the reeds swaying in the currents as we\
  \ crossed flowing rivers. Then someone told us they were poisonous sea snakes. We\
  \ walked the long way back over the bridge to get back.\n\nWe explored caves and\
  \ mines shining with asbestos in Wittenoom, once the Pilbara\u2019s largest town.\
  \ Today it\u2019s a declared contaminated site and we\u2019re lucky to have emerged\
  \ unscathed.\n\nTrapped in the bush as the rains came, the overflowing billabongs\
  \ became our swimming pools as we waited for the water to recede.\n\nWe had all\
  \ the time in the world. \n\nThe rains that filled our swimming holes washed away\
  \ some of the roads. We chopped down trees, built a makeshift bridge big enough\
  \ for one wheel, transferred the weight on to one side of the car and van and one\
  \ by one, as everyone piled onto and into the cars, much like an Indian passenger\
  \ train, we slowly skimmed the gaping hole and continued on. Not, however, until\
  \ all those who had been trapped with us had escaped. \n\nThis journey was the continuation\
  \ of one that had started in the UK and one that continued for the rest our lives.\
  \ My parent\u2019s journeys have taken them to the heights of Machu Picchu and Nepal\
  \ and along the Amazon and the Nile. I\u2019ve lived all over the word and they\
  \ have visited as we\u2019ve dined in London, climbed Mt Fuji and explored ruins\
  \ in Ayutthaya. Only last year we were sailing in Halong Bay and riding the Oriental\
  \ Express train, overnight, climbing the mountains to Sapa in northern Vietnam.\n\
  \nDad said recently that he had no regrets although he hadn\u2019t realised at the\
  \ time what an effect his and our life journey would have on his family back home.\
  \ Perhaps neither did I. However, I have no regrets.\n\nOur early adventures ignited\
  \ a passion for travel in my brother and I for which we are so grateful. Travel\
  \ nourishes the soul and it has strengthened the bond that I have enjoyed with my\
  \ parents, pushed to a level that I can only wish for others to enjoy.\n\nDad was\
  \ 87 last year and I honestly thought he was invincible, such was his passion for\
  \ life.\n\nMum thought about bringing a little of dad with us to Hong Kong. However\
  \ she couldn\u2019t open the urn! The plan is to let dad rest in many places all\
  \ over the world. That\u2019s the plan. The logistics are are work in progress ..."
