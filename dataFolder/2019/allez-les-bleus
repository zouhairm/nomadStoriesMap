Text: "Allez Les Bleus\n          In my mind, I was backpacking Europe like Rick Steves\u2019\
  \ prodigy. I was twelve countries into my summer-long odyssey, and my bag was tiny,\
  \ my itinerary was a perfect blend of local charm and major attractions, and I was\
  \ having the absolute time of my life. However, just as I was thinking I ought to\
  \ send my resume to the Travel Channel, things went\u2026 awry.\n          Naturally,\
  \ this story begins in Paris on the day of the World Cup that the French team would\
  \ go on to win that night. As the streets were being inundated with rowdy, eager\
  \ fans, my sister and I were making our way to catch a train to London. One of my\
  \ first purchases for this trip had been tickets to a concert for Paul Simon and\
  \ James Taylor in Hyde Park. I was beyond excited to watch them and imagined basking\
  \ in the sunshine as some of my favorite musicians serenaded me. \n          After\
  \ a summer of catching trains, I was accustomed to relaxed European railroad procedures.\
  \ We gave ourselves a full hour and a half to take an easy metro ride over to the\
  \ train station.\n          For some reason, the universe felt against us that post-Bastille\
  \ Day morning. We rushed out of the door, got on the packed metro going the wrong\
  \ direction and accidentally exited the metro station. By the time we were going\
  \ the right direction, I was starting to get slightly concerned about time. \n \
  \         Sure enough, the metro car we were on stopped suddenly and started spewing\
  \ out French words. They sounded serious. Everyone got off and the train left. The\
  \ next metro didn\u2019t leave for another eleven minutes\u2026       \n      I\
  \ looked at my sister and said, \u201CGrace, we\u2019re running out of time.\u201D\
  \ \n      \u201COh goodness, should we get a cab?\u201D she responded. It was our\
  \ only hope of making the train on time. \n           We ran out of the metro station\
  \ and tried to jump into the first cab that stopped for us. The driver turned around\
  \ and started yelling at us. Apparently, he was hesitant to accept us as clients.\
  \ We begged, and he eventually obliged.\n           After a tense few minutes, we\
  \ could see the train station right ahead of us. Our driver abruptly made a turn\
  \ and took us the opposite direction for a few moments, before turning around again.\
  \ Not only did the universe seem to want us to miss this train, but our driver also\
  \ did too!\n          When we finally made it to the station, we saw what every\
  \ hurried traveler fears: LINES. And there were lots of them. In my time spent traveling\
  \ around the countries of the European Union, I had forgotten about Brexit. We could\
  \ not simply hop on this train; we had to go through customs. In other words, we\
  \ were missing the train and the 1:00 PM concert.\n       After frantically begging\
  \ the company to hold the train and then frantically crying when they rebooked us\
  \ to arrive at 4:00 PM, I got a notification on my phone reminding me that I had\
  \ tickets to an upcoming event scheduled to occur from 1:00 PM to 10:00 PM. A Google\
  \ search led me to find out that the British Summer Time Concert is actually a festival\
  \ and Paul Simon didn\u2019t come on until 6 PM! I was going to make the concert\
  \ after all. We got a coffee and settled into the train station, watching the Allez\
  \ Les Bleus fans pass by. \n       By the time we arrived in London, I had somehow\
  \ gotten sick. After dropping our bags and walking through the park with none of\
  \ the ease the name suggests, we were there and we were amazed. We found a nice\
  \ spot by the carousel and I laid in the grass feeling queasy while James Taylor\
  \ serenaded me. The moment was as surreal as the day had been. When it was time\
  \ for Paul Simon to play, I stood up, threw up on some people accidentally, and\
  \ made my way to the front of the stage, where my sister and I had the best concert\
  \ experiences of our lives. \n      Things go wrong, but that's part of the adventure\
  \ of traveling. Enjoy it all."
