Text: "To get to Manila, you have to hold on tightly to the pole, shrink your legs,\
  \ bend your thorax and brace for the jolts that the small bus, called a jeepney,\
  \ makes as you move at full speed down a road in poor condition.\n\nKnowing how\
  \ to hang from a bus window without falling and possessing certain arachnid skills\
  \ are a must, because traveling in a jeepney does not necessarily mean sitting inside\
  \ it.\n\nTo get anywhere inside the megalopolis, you must remember your itinerary\
  \ well, because public transport routes only exist in the collective imagination.\n\
  \nTaking a habal habal, a motorcycle, does not imply exclusivity: you will never\
  \ be the only passenger. In a few minutes, a single motorcyclist can transport a\
  \ flock of up to 10 people, all \"flying\" in a dangerous balance.\n\nTo get to\
  \ Manila, you have to have clean lungs. Or better not to have any, so the polluting\
  \ particles have no place to nest. It is necessary to evolve so that your body is\
  \ able to photosynthesize fossil fuel smoke, and thus not return home with red eyes\
  \ and a black soul.\n\nWalking through Manila is like going from oasis to oasis\
  \ in a desert where cars are as plentiful as grains of sand.\n\nA glimpse of modernity\
  \ suddenly shines on the horizon. Then you discover the beautiful areas of the city,\
  \ which forbid dirt, tuned jeepneys and chaos. From the clean streets of Makati\
  \ or Bonifacio Global City businessmen, trees, fashion boutiques, malls and skyscrapers\
  \ emerge.\n\nYou could give in to the seduction of luxury and comfort. But come\
  \ on! What kind of adventure will you find in the bright buildings of the pretty\
  \ areas, which are exactly the same in any city in the world?\n\nThe trip continues.\
  \ The train station has a foreign name, Nichols, but its decadent aspect is very\
  \ national. Around modern areas, everything is austere. After 20 minutes of waiting,\
  \ a real train arrives, one of those old ones driven by a locomotive, with a machinist\
  \ hanging from the railing and the cursed smoke coming out of its entrails.\n\n\
  The crowd forces you to travel with your face stuck to the window. And there goes\
  \ a whole life. Or rather: hundreds of lives, those of the people who live on the\
  \ train tracks. The people who bathe with buckets while the wagons pass by; those\
  \ who eat, play, wash clothes and even sleep on mattresses cradled on the banks\
  \ of the road, in that space that is vital and deadly at the same time.\n\nSome\
  \ of the inhabitants of the tracks say goodbye to the passengers; others cover their\
  \ mouths and noses with a handkerchief, in a futile attempt not to inhale the black\
  \ cloud that the train leaves in its path.\n\nThe locomotive is choo-chooing loudly.\
  \ It goes through more ramshackle stations without a name, poor neighborhoods, shanty\
  \ houses, basketball courts and dirt concourses. Finally, it reaches the last station.\n\
  \nThe adventure continues in the huge and chaotic Divisoria market, a place to eat,\
  \ get a new dress for two dollars, discover exotic fruits and even surprise yourself\
  \ a little with the local delicacy: a duck fetus cooked inside its own egg, which\
  \ is called balut.\n\nYou walk for a long time, immersed in the vast depth of stores\
  \ of cheap things. You get lost and you find yourself again and again. The day is\
  \ ending. It\u2019s time to go back to your resting place.\n\nTo get to Manila,\
  \ you have to have, above all, patience. Seventeen small cities populated by 15\
  \ million inhabitants can be like a jeepney: it\u2019s not easy to board, but once\
  \ you\u2019re in, it becomes unforgettable."
