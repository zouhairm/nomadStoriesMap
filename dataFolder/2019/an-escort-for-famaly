Text: "Before my birth, my parents started their history traveling together, so my\
  \ life came with a lot of travelings histories. The most remarkable was when I was\
  \ in college and started symptoms of anxiety, and my dad thought a trip to the Brazilian\
  \ northeast in our 'escort' was a good idea for the best family bond and my recovery.\
  \ \nThe car is our companion since 2003 and it's an old car from 1991 and the trip\
  \ taken 10.000km in Brazilian north and northeast, the car didn't have air-conditioned\
  \ and the trip happened in summer of 2014, was warm but was an adventurous journey.\
  \ In that time, we didn't have GPS or smartphones just a paper map and intuition,\
  \ my father always lost the right entry of the cities and sometimes forgot to stop\
  \ for our lunch. In the paper map, I found a shortcut but this was on a one side\
  \ road with the traffic in both directions on the edge of a hill in Serra da Ibiapaba\
  \ in CE-253 close to Ibiapina city. Because of the narrow road and the view on the\
  \ brink of a precipice my mom started crying and for the first time, I see her fear\
  \ of heights. I was euphoric and since I was the photographer of the trip, I took\
  \ pictures of everything I wanted to mark that in my memory. My father was tension\
  \ and the car was suffering, the climbing was too much for an old car traveler,\
  \ but it passes through the challenge and proves his strength and power. \nOn the\
  \ top of the hill has an overlook and the view was amazing with all the native vegetation\
  \ preserved. Despite the beautiful view, my mom remained nervous and while my dad\
  \ takes care of the car I took my mom's hand and she entrusted me to went closer\
  \ to the edge. I calmed her and I talked about the fear I had, and I cared about\
  \ her feelings too. I aimed the beauty of that place and gradually she was more\
  \ relaxed. Doing that for her, I understood my own fear and anxiety, trying to help\
  \ her was like trying to help me in my hardest days. The bond with her grown and\
  \ the trip turns to be amazing and unforgettable."
