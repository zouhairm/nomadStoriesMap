Text: "The town felt much like any other German suburb, and I had seen more imposing\
  \ castles in the past than the one that we were approaching. It was dark. It was\
  \ cold. I was hungry, but full of excitement. This was Colditz and we were heading\
  \ to the famous Prisoner of War camp, the site of so many daring escape attempts.\
  \ My friend had suggested that I join him on a trip that would pass through the\
  \ area, and I had quickly decided that I would badger him into a time-consuming\
  \ and inconvenient diversion in order to spend a night at Colditz castle, now a\
  \ youth hostel, so that I could pay homage to the focus-point of so many childhood\
  \ fantasies. \n\nWe had arrived in the town later than I had planned, and it was\
  \ only thanks to a kind local driver that we were spared a lengthy walk up the snowy\
  \ roads. She dropped us off at the entrance, and checked in. The museum was closed\
  \ by the time we arrived, the last tour long finished, and we were to leave early\
  \ the following morning, but it didn\u2019t matter \u2013 we were there for the\
  \ atmosphere, not for the education. We stepped back out on to the courtyard, gazed\
  \ up at tall white walls and imagined ourselves trying to escape them. Happily,\
  \ our experience of the castle was quite unlike that of the POWs, and the next moment\
  \ we were heading out of the gates to find some food. \n\nReturning much later,\
  \ we found that the gates had been closed and locked. This was not expected. We\
  \ started walking around the castle, realising, bizarrely, that we were now trying\
  \ to work out how to break into Colditz. We were not put to the test \u2013 we found\
  \ another entrance and soon turned in for our night in POW camp \u2013 albeit with\
  \ the relative comfort of a 21st century tourist. It did not matter that the hostel\
  \ was in the old guardhouse, not the prisoners\u2019 quarters \u2013 we were close\
  \ enough. Someone walked down the corridor outside. In my mind\u2019s ear I heard\
  \ the footsteps of a guard on patrol.  I nodded off \n\nWe awoke suddenly and in\
  \ a panic; we had slept through our alarms and were late for a train \u2013 we had\
  \ a connection to catch out of Leipzig, and this was only train into the city that\
  \ would get us there on time. We settled and set off into the town at great speed,\
  \ watching the time, and hoping desperately that we were going the right way. We\
  \ were beginning to give up when suddenly we stumbled across the station and saw\
  \ the train standing on the platform. We jumped into the train, breathless and relieved.\
  \ The train began to move. We had made it.   \nWe realised, as we made the journey\
  \ into Leipzig, that we had been running down some of the same roads, and through\
  \ the same fields, as those, who, all those years ago, fled Colditz. Truly this\
  \ was a place were History, with a bit of imagination, comes to life."
