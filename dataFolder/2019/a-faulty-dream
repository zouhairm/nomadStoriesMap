Text: "I am Indian, Jak was German and it was the first time we set foot in a local\
  \ train in India. Having just returned from a wonderful vacation in Varkala- a cute\
  \ little cliff town with sandy beaches and coconut trees located at the southernmost\
  \ tip of Kerala, we were steadily making our way back to Bangalore. Now, if you\u2019\
  ve ever been to India or have any friends and acquaintances from there, you\u2019\
  d probably be aware of the supremely weird manner in which the Indian Railway System\
  \ operates. Jak assured me that he had made the reservations well in advance, so\
  \ when the ticket conductor approached us, I assumed there was nothing to worry\
  \ about. But 10 minutes later, I was proven wrong. After scanning the entire list,\
  \ the old man with groggy eyes and a stern smile announced that we had been waitlisted.\
  \ He gave us an angry glare and repeated:\n\n\u201CYou\u2019ve been waitlisted;\
  \ you don\u2019t have allotted seats.  Get off the train right now or move to General\
  \ Class.\u201D\n\nIt was the middle of the night and I was trying hard not to panic.\
  \ We had a 12 hour journey ahead and there was no way we would be able to survive\
  \ in General class. The other option was to bribe the TC, but given his rigid demeanour,\
  \ it didn\u2019t seem like the odds would be in our favour. Clueless as to what\
  \ to do next, we headed towards the first bogie. People were all over the place\
  \ and slept everywhere-on the floor, on the luggage carriers above and some of them\
  \ near the toilets. Women made hammocks and tied them from one seat to another for\
  \ their little babies.  The more fortunate ones got a seat to themselves, with a\
  \ mobile port attached. I don\u2019t mean to sound like a spoilt brat because I\
  \ am generally quite adaptable, but travelling in a compartment filled with more\
  \ than a hundred people is not everyone\u2019s cup of tea. To top it all, I had\
  \ a sprained ankle. When we somehow managed to squeeze through, a kind gentleman\
  \ made room for us. After narrating what had happened, he just smirked and said,\u201D\
  It\u2019s going to be an experience you won\u2019t forget.\u201D \n\nSure it was\
  \ an experience we didn\u2019t forget. With our heads on each other\u2019s shoulders\
  \ all through the night, we did eventually manage to fall asleep, even with all\
  \ the crying and yelling. It was hot, claustrophobic and reeked of sweat. I was\
  \ just glad I had Jak by my side. When we woke up the next day, both of us had full\
  \ fledged body aches but just managed to laugh it off.  We were home and we had\
  \ unintentionally gotten something off our bucket list, so there were no regrets."
