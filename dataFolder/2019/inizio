Text: "I could say that we both knew it was over when we made separate plans for travel\
  \ last spring, he for Nepal and I for Italy. His words, spoken in anger and hurt\
  \ that night in late January, \u201CWaking up in another country together\u2026\
  \ looking out at the sunrise over a different ocean... I want that to be in the\
  \ arms of a lover, not a travel buddy! Why don\u2019t you understand that? Why can\u2019\
  t you even begin to feel what that means? Why don\u2019t you love me the way that\
  \ I love you?\u201D \n\nHe was right. I didn\u2019t understand. Not then, I didn\u2019\
  t. I loved him the same way I always had, my best friend, my partner. Only low levels\
  \ of attraction, yes, but a steadfast commitment. An earnestness. I couldn\u2019\
  t fathom why we wouldn\u2019t be sharing our vacation together this year as we always\
  \ had. I wrestled with it. In retrospect, yes, I could look back and say that our\
  \ marriage was over then - with the booking of different flights and the reading\
  \ of different travel blogs - but it would take months and months of arduous work\
  \ upon the returns from each of our journeys before the end was plain to us both,\
  \ before it was unapologetically bare before us and everyone we knew. \n\nI flew\
  \ to Rome that April. Alone. Just a couple of months after that conversation. And\
  \ upon landing, I spent my first hour walking her streets, my body jetlagged, mind\
  \ fatigued and heart numb. But my eyes were absolutely wide, taking in ivy covered\
  \ yellow walls, aged shutters, gray cobbled streets. Hungry and tired, I sought\
  \ out a sidewalk cafe whose tables and courtyard view well-matched my preconceived\
  \ images of how such things should look. Ordered lasagne bolognese, liking the sound\
  \ of the words on my tongue. And with my first bite of that delectably layered dish,\
  \ I scalded the roof of my mouth so badly that with every sing bite I took throughout\
  \ the next ten days of travel, I would be ever be reminded of that very first meal.\n\
  \nI rode clean and quiet trains through pastoral settings that were everything I\
  \ had imagined they would be, replete with vineyards and villas, earth and sky,\
  \ greens and lavenders, music and poetry promising. Each mile forward gently pulled\
  \ the tiniest bits of weight from my shoulders, burdens from my mind, leaving them\
  \ behind me, quiet, on tracks stretching ever rearward.\n\nFirst to Venice, her\
  \ streets jammed with shoppers and eaters, gazers and lovers. Her canals all grand\
  \ to me, who each night fell asleep and then again woke up to the sound of waves\
  \ lapping outside the window near the bed in which I slept alone. And peacefully.\n\
  \nAnd then on to Florence, if only for a few hours so as to stand in line for the\
  \ Panini I was told by a friend was a must do.\n\nBut it was on the shore of Vernazza,\
  \ having for several days quietly tucked myself under bright colored umbrellas and\
  \ having just the day before hiked south from Corniglia up north to Monterosso that\
  \ my head had finally cleared enough to hear what my heart had so long been trying\
  \ to say. On a day late in an April, on a rocky shore in Italy, I stood looking\
  \ long and hard across the ocean toward the who and the what that I had always considered\
  \ \u201Chome\u201D. And, with Italy and my back, arms raised the sky, chest bared\
  \ to that sea, and my future uncertain but mine, I accepted and celebrated that\
  \ home was in fact anchored ever so firmly within my chest. That my own heart was\
  \ the place I should always have known as my truest home."
