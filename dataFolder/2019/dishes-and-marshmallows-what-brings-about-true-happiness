Text: "\u201CFor fun on the island, I like to clean my room, fold blankets, but my\
  \ favorite is washing the dishes. I LOVE washing the dishes\u201D Maeva proudly\
  \ exclaimed. It was morning tea time at the kids\u2019 camp I was working at in\
  \ Rarotonga. I sat in the semi-circle of children around me, blown away as the others\
  \ chimed in with their favorite household chores, all proclaiming that washing dishes\
  \ was the highlight of their day. This was not the answer I was expecting; but I\
  \ soon understood that with hardly any forms of entertainment on the 18 mile long\
  \ island, these kids took any opportunity they received and turned it into something\
  \ worthwhile. \n\nUntil I went to college, I could not even locate Rarotonga on\
  \ a map. But after hearing about the opportunity to travel to the Cook Islands through\
  \ friends at a party, I ended up traveling alone on a flight 4,777 miles away from\
  \ home towards an island in the South Pacific. Loaded with school supplies and donated\
  \ clothing, I took off for a minuscule island in hopes of assisting the community\
  \ while learning more about the culture and myself.\n \nWhile in Rarotonga, I independently\
  \ designed and coordinated a weeklong children's camp at a local missionary base.\
  \ Throughout the camp, the children, ages 4-14, were so gracious and appreciative\
  \ of all the activities and crafts I brought. One young boy, Taunga, was elated\
  \ when I handed him a single marshmallow. He claimed his mom could not afford to\
  \ buy such luxuries, only having a marshmallow one other time in his life. Small\
  \ events like this made all my hard work fundraising over $1,100 for supplies worth\
  \ it. \n\nThe cost of living in Rarotonga is outrageous, leaving families to struggle.\
  \ All the local businesses feel the pressure, limiting many islanders to only part-time\
  \ positions. Minimum wage is only $6 an hour, and taxes are withdrawn from their\
  \ paycheck, so their take home pay is only about $200 a week. Despite this, the\
  \ islanders were such kind, loving people, and inspired me to better myself. They\
  \ exude a joyous presence everywhere they go, aiding others in any way possible.\
  \ For instance, the children I worked with had next to no resources or luxuries.\
  \ Yet when one of them brought a chocolate bar to morning tea, she split it up and\
  \ gave a piece to every leader and kid there, leaving herself with nothing. The\
  \ community bonding I witnessed was admirable, and has prompted me to consider how\
  \ I am spending my \u201Ctime, talents, and treasures.\u201D\n\nThis chance to go\
  \ to such an amazing island was exactly what I was looking for, insightful and inspiring.\
  \ The kids\u2019 camp not only allowed me to learn from the lives of many young\
  \ islanders, but greatly affected my own spiritual life. I didn't expect to find\
  \ this sense of belonging and deeper understanding of life from these young children,\
  \ yet I was reminded of the importance strong relationships leading to overall happiness."
