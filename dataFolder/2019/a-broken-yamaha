Text: "\u201CXin ch\xE0o! Hello! Hello!\u201D\n\tI purse my lips and briefly think\
  \ of ignoring the call, but decide against it. I turn back and see that it\u2019\
  s one of the xe \xF4m drivers. \u201CHello!\u201D he grins and waves rambunctiously\
  \ at me. \n\t\u201CHello,\u201D I nod, then turn around, determined not to engage\
  \ anymore. I don\u2019t need a taxi today and quite frankly I don\u2019t want to\
  \ deal with any pushy salespeople when I\u2019m lugging a massive bike and sweating\
  \ profusely, inhaling diesel from the passing bikes which are lucky enough to actually\
  \ be running.\n\t\u201CHello!\u201D someone calls again. It\u2019s a different someone.\n\
  \tI turn back and see that it\u2019s another xe \xF4m driver. He waves at me, not\
  \ as obnoxiously as his friend and I see he\u2019s starting his bike. I sigh, really\
  \ not in the mood to explain that I don\u2019t need a ride.\n\tThe xe \xF4m driver\
  \ zooms up alongside me, his helmet dangling uselessly from the handle of his motorbike.\
  \ He points at my bike and asks me something I don\u2019t understand. I shake my\
  \ head and he points again, asks again.\n\tI\u2019m still shaking my head when he\
  \ starts miming. He puts his foot out, as though to balance my bike. Points at his\
  \ friend, points at my other side. Points at me, and gestures for me to get on the\
  \ bike.\n\tI laugh out loud and shake my head harder. No, sir. I don\u2019t want\
  \ to sit on my broken bike while you and your friend balance me with your feet and\
  \ try to drive me down the road. He nods firmly and I smile, a little uncomfortably\
  \ now. I hope I\u2019m giving an apologetic smile as I wave him off and start crossing\
  \ the road, other motorbikes swerving to avoid me. When a taxi comes I hustle. Taxis\
  \ don\u2019t stop or swerve.\n\tI\u2019m another two minutes down the road, still\
  \ shaking my head at the ludicrousness of the suggestion, when I hear again, \u201C\
  Hello! Hello!\u201D\n\tI turn back and now I feel a little nervous. All of the xe\
  \ \xF4m drivers have followed me. There are six of them. One hops off his bike as\
  \ he approaches and passes his bike to his friend. \n\tThe man approaches me. It\u2019\
  s the same man who\u2019d mimed to me earlier. He is short, but strong with dark\
  \ skin and some moles on his face. His thick black hair is parted to the side in\
  \ a line that\u2019s so straight you could lay a pin on it. He reaches for my bike\
  \ and grabs my handle bars. I have no choice but to let go. He moves faster than\
  \ I had been, shoving the bike hard and quick along the street. The other xe \xF4\
  m drivers follow him. I have to hurry to keep up. My heart is pounding. My Vietnamese,\
  \ despite taking classes, is still atrocious and I'm starting to wonder whether\
  \ this crowd of men are helpful or harmful.\n\tI follow the laughing, talking crowd\
  \ of xe \xF4m drivers and my poor red bike down the road. We\u2019re walking and\
  \ farther and farther now. I can see West Lake in the distance, when suddenly the\
  \ xe \xF4m drivers turn right, down a quiet road.\n\tThe road is silent, which is\
  \ bizarre for Hanoi. My skin is truly heating up now and I wonder whether I should\
  \ keep following them. \n\tWe pass one dark shop front advertising Choco-pies. When\
  \ the man holding my bike suddenly turns left and pushes my bike through the front\
  \ doors of a peeling yellow building, my heart nearly stops. I rush forward, peering\
  \ into the dark interior and let out a rush of breath.\n\tIt\u2019s a mechanics.\n\
  \tAs the shop owners push my bike up onto its kickstand and the young boy drags\
  \ a massive tool box over I feel a tap on my arm. I look down to see one of the\
  \ xe \xF4m drivers who has not spoken yet. He\u2019s much older then the other xe\
  \ \xF4m drivers, loose skin hanging off his face like cloth on a line. \n\t\u201C\
  Hello,\u201D he says, \u201CWhere are you from?\u201D\n\tMy eyebrows turn up in\
  \ the middle. I smile."
