Text: "I arrived to the markets of Tayoke Tan sleep deprived and running off caffeine\
  \ and the background buzz of adrenaline. The buildings are close and varied in appearance.\
  \ Soot and burnt orange paint peels from the walls as laundry hangs and goods are\
  \ sent by pulley system, precariously scaling the balconies. The scent of clove,\
  \ tobacco, coriander, salt and lime lingers in the air, it dances and morphs as\
  \ I walk.\n\nI pass by stalls of animals being butchered on the street, mainly chicken\
  \ and pork, one meat I didn\u2019t recognise made me curious to what it was, my\
  \ suspicions were confirmed when the butcher remorsefully held up the unmistakable\
  \ half-carcass of dog.\n\nBuckets of eels writhe in the growing heat, teenagers\
  \ with thanaka painted faces pick live crab squatting on the sidewalk, vibrant herbs\
  \ and vegetables splash colour throughout the narrow passage. Groups of female monks\
  \ in pale pink robes, golden shawls and silk umbrellas seek donations from the vendors,\
  \ stray dogs beg for scraps and taxis crawl noisily through the crowds.\n\nI did\
  \ not have the pleasure to ramble. My schedule was tight and I had to haggle the\
  \ best I could to avoid paying almost double than the locals - the unfortunate price\
  \ for being the only Westerner - something that grew increasingly infuriating. \n\
  \nThe sticky, close heat of downtown Yangon was inescapable; all I could think about\
  \ was making it to the hotel to shower and recharge. Once free from the grip of\
  \ the markets I met Aung Tu, the bar supervisor for the event I was here to cater\
  \ for. He stood in the reception of the hotel with a presence that relaxed my racing\
  \ mind. His smile revealed reddish-brown-stained teeth that comes from chewing betelnut,\
  \ which they call \u2018kun-ya\u2019 (which is the nut of the areca palm that is\
  \ mixed with lime powder and other spices, wrapped in a betel leaf). As I extended\
  \ my hand to him, dark eyes radiate kindness back at me. \n\nWe didn\u2019t spend\
  \ much time together as the event was running. I was frantically setting up the\
  \ kitchen, unpacking and organising all the food I had prepared the previous two\
  \ days and delegating jobs to the ill-prepared chefs I had there to support me.\
  \ \n\nThe event was a success and the pressure I had felt evaporated by the smiles\
  \ of guests and organisers. Back in my hotel room I got to know Aung Tu more as\
  \ we bonded over our affinity for single malt, pouring generous glasses of Macallan.\n\
  \nThe following day, as I clambour into the back of a taxi with four of the other\
  \ caterers, Aung Tu takes my hand and wraps it around his, rests his head on my\
  \ shoulder and tells me: \u2018I really like you man\u2019. \u2018I really like\
  \ you too, man\u2019, I reply. I turn to where my other hand is tangled with my\
  \ girlfriend\u2019s - her huge grin expresses how we both feel.\n\nComing from a\
  \ culture where male to male contact and signs of affection like this aren\u2019\
  t often shown, or bullied and stigmatized, it made the act seem so special. This\
  \ theme of contact and affection continued. On one occasion he prized apart my girlfriend\u2019\
  s hand from mine to hold on to me! She laughed out in mock jealousy and we exchanged\
  \ glances of endearment.\n\nI began to notice this more and more often among the\
  \ young males of Myanmar. Driving past a dusty, sleepy petrol station, two boys\
  \ of about 17 dressed in sarongs and striking thanaka rest lazily with their arms\
  \ around each other.\n\nMoving to a country that has been marred by political atrocities\
  \ and tainted by media coverage, I did not know what to expect. The love, kindness\
  \ and open affection amongst the young male culture was a welcome surprise, something\
  \ that one rarely experiences growing up in the UK.\n\nAung Tu and I have become\
  \ very good friends and we are now working together. His childlike love of life\
  \ inspires me daily and the country never ceases to surprise me."
