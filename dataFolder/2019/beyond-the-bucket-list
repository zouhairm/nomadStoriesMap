Text: "A eurail pass and 14 countries later, I had found home, I had found myself.\
  \ \n\nThis story started two and a half months before that. A fully planned trip\
  \ and three friends along, is how i started my eurotrip.\nLess than 24 hours in\
  \ Paris, and I had underestimated Jet lag, overslept in my hostel, missed a train\
  \ and lost my friends. They say \u2018Paris is always a good idea\u2019, 1st day\
  \ in Paris, 7:30 in the morning and teary eyed, trying to book next train to Marseille,\
  \ my heart didn\u2019t feel it right. Maybe eurotrip was a mistake. I had never\
  \ been outside my country, this was not supposed to happen to me. And a million\
  \ other thoughts. Noticing my kohl smeared eyes, the receptionist walked towards\
  \ me and all I could muster was \u2018This is all your mistake, you should have\
  \ let them enter the ladies dorm and wake me up\u2019, all the while knowing that\
  \ i was at fault. They lie when they say French are impatient. Joe gave me his laptop\
  \ to book the ticket and as fate would have it, there was none available. What next\
  \ now? Joe suggested I go to Milan instead, it was his favourite place. The conviction\
  \ in his voice made me book a ticket to Milan. Eurail pass is a saviour after all.\
  \ \n\nMy first eurail journey and I made a friend from Egypt. Eight hours of chitter\
  \ chatter bla bla and my Egyptian friend made me curious for Greece. Greece is his\
  \ first love he said. I still don\u2019t know how those hours passed by and I reached\
  \ the most beautiful Central Station of Europe. Good food, good streets, good clothes\
  \ and beautiful people and train announcements like lullabies is what Milan is all\
  \ about. Click shop click shop click shop is how i spent my first two days in Italy.\
  \ It was time for me to plan where to go next and as I opened the Eurail map, I\
  \ could see Switzerland having the biggest area there. Eurail had given me wings.\
  \ I boarded a train to Domodossola, then to Brig, then to Interlakan, this was the\
  \ most beautiful journey I have ever had in my life. A bollywood lovers Eurotrip\
  \ starts and ends at Switzerland, mine had started just right. Crossing numerous\
  \ items from my bucket list, I moved towards Greece. I fell in love with the shades\
  \ of blue. Another item ticked off from my bucket list - My Greek Holiday. \n\n\
  2 months had passed and I had been to Prague, Budapest, Iceland, Vienna, Zagreb,\
  \ Dubrovnik, Amsterdam, Rome, Cinque Terre, Firenze, Brugge, Munich, Salzburg, name\
  \ a place and I must have passed through that. It was about time I moved to South\
  \ of France to get myself registered for a 15 day course at Marseille, for which\
  \ I had originally come to Europe. \n\nAs I entered my Airbnb in Marseille, a sweet\
  \ lady opened the door and i thought she had come to help me check in. She didn\u2019\
  t speak English and my french conversation skills were limited to \u2018Je ne parle\
  \ paa Francaise\u2019. Trying to talk to each other for 10-12 mins, we finally gave\
  \ up. It had been more than an hour and the lady wasn\u2019t leaving the house.\
  \ I rechecked my airbnb booking and there it was, the blunder I had committed. This\
  \ booking was a private room in someone\u2019s house. I had my apprehension of living\
  \ with a french family. How would we adjust. And I had wanted some independence.\
  \ With all these thoughts running in my head, I fell asleep. I woke up with a knock\
  \ on my door. A very cute little girl called me for dinner. I went out to have dinner\
  \ with a French family which I thought would be awkward and silent. She helped me\
  \ with a serving of mutton soup and bread. I felt the presence of my mother\u2019\
  s taste in that food. The rest of those fifteen days is a tale of butter chicken,\
  \ naan, carrot soup, rajma chawal, bollywood and french lessons on weather. I had\
  \ found a mother and a little sister in Marseille.\n\nMarseille has a smell of fresh\
  \ air. Marseille is where I belong. Marseille is home."
