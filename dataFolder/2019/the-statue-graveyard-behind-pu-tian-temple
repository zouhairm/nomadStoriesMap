Text: "The t-shirt sticks to my back. Too impatient to decipher the Mandarin writings\
  \ that will lead me on the correct bus route, I have commenced the task of walking\
  \ up a hill outside of Hsinchu in  35 degrees celsius. A task on a very stubborn\
  \ (or, more accurately, foolish) Scandinavian would think to do. The road is winding\
  \ its way up the ascent, forcing the few passing vehicles to do so on first gear.\
  \ Right through it is a stone paved path heading straight up. In combination with\
  \ the pressing humidity, it feels as if I am on a pilgrimage of sorts.\n\nSo how\
  \ do I find myself here? Even the receptionist at my Taipei hostel gasps \u201C\
  Why Hsinchu?!\u201D when I reveal my travel plans the night prior. \n\nIt is not\
  \ Hsinchu per se that has brought me on the westbound train this particular April\
  \ morning. The city itself is a mishmash of thick traffic fumes and billboards in\
  \ a quantity similar to that of Times Square but without any of the neon. A concrete\
  \ jungle where high-rise modern buildings sit next to temples with flamboyant dragons\
  \ adorning the rooftops. \n\nNo, it is not Hsinchu per se. Rather it is a photo\
  \ imprinted in my mind that has lead me on this pilgrimage of sorts. While researching\
  \ my trip to Taiwan a few weeks prior, I stumbled upon it. It pictures a statue\
  \ of a sitting Buddha with eyes resting, hands in a shuni mudra and green ivy climbing\
  \ across the stone figure. Kind of like he would have been sat so still in peaceful\
  \ meditation that the garden, so used to his presence, simply decided to incorporate\
  \ it into itself. \n\nThe photo is captured in a garden that makes part of the Pu\
  \ Tian temple complex about five kilometres outside of Hsinchu city. With the exception\
  \ of a few sentences in the blog post from which the photo originated, this is the\
  \ kind of place only mentioned in the periphery of the guidebooks. Hence, of course,\
  \ my cluelessness on how to get there efficiently.\n\nWhile most people will not\
  \ make it further than to the massive statue of Guan Gong deity at the main temple\
  \ (and by all means, he is basically the god of hook-ups!), the real treasure lies\
  \ beyond. If you continue through the temple yard, and down a set of stone stairs,\
  \ you find the gardens. A place difficult to describe, but imagine something like\
  \ a graveyard for abandoned statues. \n\nMany years ago, perhaps even decades, Guquifeng\
  \ Statue Garden seems to have been a popular attraction for visitors. Now, large\
  \ sections have been closed off and the ivy has gone berserk in its quest to cover\
  \ its displays. Pathways come to abrupt stops as one encounters locked gates or\
  \ fallen trees. It is like Taiwan's answer to Pompeii. At each turn of these undulating\
  \ paths, there is something new to rest eyes upon. Here, you will find classic eastern\
  \ figurines like geishas, foo dogs and warriors, but also Egyptian Pharos that observe\
  \ you with very Mona Lisa-esque smiles, wood carvings of zebras, the Discobolus\
  \ taking aim at you behind a set of bushes, a replica of the Statue of Liberty and\
  \ ponies so decorative they must have escaped the fairground carousels to get here.\
  \ \n\nWhat makes it ever more intriguing is how it seems to lack any rhyme or reason.\
  \ These items are simply stacked upon one another in a random order. I can't help\
  \ but to wonder where they all came from, and more so, how they ended up on this\
  \ particular corner of Taiwan's west coast? \n\nWhile this place leaves me with\
  \ more questions than answers, there is something so beautiful about it all.  It\
  \ is like some sort of museum of human existence. A scribble on a restroom wall\
  \ \u201CI was here\u201D. What ever its answers might be, wandering about these\
  \ seemingly abandoned gardens all to myself is one of those experiences I am sure\
  \ to remember for always. \n\nOf course, it also serves as a sweet reminder to look\
  \ beyond the guidebook highlights every now and again."
