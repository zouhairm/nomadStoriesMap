Text: "*a dive of a beauty..:*\n\nshe never knew swimming. she wanted to learn but\
  \ there was no ponds or lakes nearby.  pretented she knew swimming. she got respect\
  \ through her verbal swimming capabilities. \n\non a day of new year 3 of them took\
  \ a decision and hiked a reserve forest just before starting their club for supporting\
  \ women in society. in the core jungle they saw a small waterfalls with a natural\
  \ swimming pool. three of them got into their pure woman form in a blink and lied\
  \ on the banks. she stood up and climbed the slippery beautiful waterfalls without\
  \ further thinking.she went higher and higher as she was enjoying the freedom, cold\
  \ and spring water. got into top and decided to go back down. \nshe didnt knew how\
  \ high she was.\nshe looked at the pond... her legs were shivering... rocks were\
  \ slippery to go down further. she realized doesnt know swimming actually. she stood\
  \ there.\n\n decisions .. she could see small fishes and clean water. \"come on\
  \ dive... it will awesome .. \"she heard the voices in the silent jungle. she was\
  \ confused. \n\nshe thought , looked around, even with support she was getting confused.\
  \ she waited for few moments to get some support from within herself. \"i have to.\
  \ I can do this... there are no  options, and it will\" . she closed and opened\
  \ her eyes .. deep breaths.. eyebrows lifted .. eye blinks.. she decided to take\
  \ one step back.. untied those long hair.. she looked at her physique as if for\
  \ the first time.. for a moment she felt like became a real woman.\n\n in a trance\
  \ of a second she took the free leap .. adrenaline!!!...\nshe kissed the water like\
  \ a kingfisher. \nwent under water like mermaid.\n birds sang...r breeze came..\
  \ trees danced.. sun shined..\nit was a rebirth forr the woman in her when she heard\
  \ the cheers and applauds and saw a new world of courage when her head poped up\
  \ from the water. \nthey gave her hands.\n\nshe was happy and realized i'm a woman\
  \ i'm made to create energy . while returning, the other two were still talking\
  \ about their feministic views and walking fast meanwhile a woman was thinking and\
  \ realizing her capabilities. The divine feminine energy."
