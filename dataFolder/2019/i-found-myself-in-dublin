Text: "It is interesting how endings give rise to new beginnings no matter what the\
  \ circumstance. Like a phoenix rising from the ashes so too can we rise anew from\
  \ the embers when our own flame dies out.  Unlike the phoenix however, we have more\
  \ direct responsibility for our rebirth. We have the ability to wallow in the warm\
  \ and comforting embers of our grief; hiding in the darkness and postponing new\
  \ growth. Conversely, we can seek the breath of new life. The key is oxygen; the\
  \ essential element needed for a new flame to ignite and the best way to get oxygen\
  \ is to get outside. I found myself in the embers of a past life not long ago. They\
  \ were warm but they were suffocating and I needed air. So, to the air I took. At\
  \ 32 years of age I was single for the first time in my adult life and I wanted\
  \ to be bold. With emerald eyes, deep brown hair, ruddy pale skin and ancestry confirmation\
  \ I am the picture of an Irish lass. Though American born I have always been drawn\
  \ to the Emerald Isle; to breath the air of my ancestors, walk the cobblestone paths\
  \ and perhaps absorb a little of the luck of the Irish to bless my rebirth. \nI\
  \ booked a week in Dublin city and boarded a plane all on my own. I woke with the\
  \ sun over Christ Church Cathedral and roamed the streets of cobblestone. I drank\
  \ a Guinness and several more. I danced with strangers and walked a pebbly shore.\
  \ History wooed me and myths came alive in the streets of Dublin I began to thrive.\
  \ I felt at home even though I was far away and something inside me wondered if\
  \ I could stay. Independent, self-assured and strong on my own I found myself in\
  \ Dublin when I took a leap into the unknown. \nNow, back home in the Mile High\
  \ City I still feel the winds calling me. No longer do I rest in warm embers of\
  \ mourning but my lungs are ever longing for a fresh breath of new life. So, never\
  \ will I stop traveling and adventuring beyond the familiar boarders of my suburban\
  \ town. We can dare to live or we can resign to lie. I for one choose to live and\
  \ this vast and beautiful world is rife with the oxygen of life."
