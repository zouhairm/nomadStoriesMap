Text: "Growing up in village, living a shepherded life I have an attachment with nature.\
  \ I have grown up looking at high mountains surrounded by me. I have witnessed floods,\
  \ glaciers, and the beauty of cherry blossom as well. \nWhen I was eighteen, I got\
  \ the opportunity to visit a city nearby my village, and in 2016 I got an opportunity\
  \ to visit United States of America on CCIP fellowship program which was an amazing\
  \ journey of whole life. \nI started my journey from my village Nomal, Northern\
  \ areas of Pakistan. It took 52 hours by bus to reach Karachi after a very exhaustive\
  \ journey. Till then everything was fine, that I was comfortable in traveling with\
  \ local people, but then I had to start my journey out the country so I was so excited\
  \ and at the same time I was so nervous that so many points were arising in my mind.\
  \ Question in my mind were like, how should I manage to travel by aeroplane, will\
  \ I be able to communicate properly with the people when I have speak only English,\
  \ what if I am going miss the next catching flight? There were so many questions.\n\
  Finally, the next day I took my plan from Karachi Airport to Qatar which took around\
  \ three hours. That journey was so amazing, I was totally ok when I arrived at Qatar\
  \ airport.  Then I have three more hours to catch the next flight from Qatar to\
  \ Washington DC. As I was a bit nervous and afraid of missing the catching flight,\
  \ without wasting time I reached in their waiting room. I didn\u2019t even purchase\
  \ some cookies as I was totally unaware that the next flight is of seventeen hours.\
  \  \nIn my flight to the U.S on the right side there was a women, and on the left\
  \ side there was young Indian guy, but the problem was I couldn\u2019t not initiate\
  \ discussion until they would say something and after six hours I didn\u2019t get\
  \ any response. As Indian was used to drink few different type of sodas, and I was\
  \ not sure whether it was alcohol or random soda so I barely manage to say hello\
  \ to the women! She said Hi, I tried to speak with her in my with my broken English\
  \ language, and suddenly what a great pleasure to find a country women. As we both\
  \ had similar problem that we were not fluent in speaking English so discussed for\
  \ few hours in Urdu. \nWhen we were crossing Europe and our aeroplane was flying\
  \ 30000 feet above sea level, we noticed aeroplane is not flying smoothly, and suddenly\
  \ we got call to tight our seat belts, and heard that due to wind aeroplane will\
  \ be landed very soon. I noticed some panic inside aeroplane, passengers started\
  \ to gossip with each other\u2014what was happening I was not getting actually.\
  \ When I looked down from window I just could see blue color which was sea! \nOMG!\
  \ What is going on? Is plan going to crash? Is my journey going to end here? Again\
  \ I had several question in my mind\u2014 but after few minutes I noticed that flight\
  \ started to move smoothly. It take few more hours and finally I am flying above\
  \ the dream land which was only in my dream so far. I was in the airspace of United\
  \ States of America.  \nAs our plan landed I was between thousands of people in\
  \ airport, but being a fellow of a fellowship program, I got call with in few minutes.\
  \ As I got outside of the airport I was speechless to see that my coordinator was\
  \ waiting for me holding my name on a big banner. Mr. NAIK ALAM, WELCOME TO AMERICA!\
  \ That was a moment when I noticed that a journey into a leap is going to be really\
  \ worthy. \nAfter meeting my coordinator I was feeling like I am at my home, and\
  \ the efforts I put in to get this fellowship opportunity paid off in shape of such\
  \ a beautiful reward. In that whole year I got the opportunity to study, I work\
  \ with an NGO, and visited around ten states of the U.S."
