Text: "You\u2019ll hear all kinds of stories about Las Vegas that will make the city\
  \ seem like a NC-17 rated place: gambling, strippers, partying, drinking and all\
  \ that. But, historically, it is a city that adapts itself to what you need. Living\
  \ on gambling and tourism - and, the recession of 2008 is proof, dying from the\
  \ lack of it - , Vegas redesigns itself from time to time to offer something newer,\
  \ larger, brighter. Nothing there looks real: the buildings are impossibly huge\
  \ - and not only tall - , with reflective windows that shine all day, reflecting\
  \ the impossibly hot desert sun. The constructions are so majestic that the entrance\
  \ doors look pathetically common. Anything regular in Vegas translates as pathetic,\
  \ while, anywhere else, Vegas itself may come as that.\n\nThe beauty of a city so\
  \ superlative like Las Vegas is not in the details. Actually, being attentive to\
  \ them becomes an issue, just like seeing behind the curtain ruins the spectacle.\n\
  \nOn Fremont Street, the address covered with the world\u2019s largest LED screen,\
  \ the Las Vegas collective hallucination becomes closer to reality: it\u2019s so\
  \ bright you become unsure it\u2019s really the nighttime. It\u2019s so loud, with\
  \ \u201Cblings\u201D, live music, laughter, drunken chatter and screams from the\
  \ zipline, you can\u2019t focus. And it\u2019s so different from anything you\u2019\
  ve seen before it\u2019s easy to let yourself dive into the madness. It\u2019s Las\
  \ Vegas, after all, and your hedonist impulses rejoice; no matter what happens,\
  \ it stays here!\n\nSo, you may find yourself in a winning streak on Fremont Street.\
  \ The (very) little black dress you chose for the night attracted the attention\
  \ you expected. The cool Australian girl sharing the same bunk as you in the cheapest\
  \ hostel at the worst part of the Strip has quickly become the best travel company.\
  \ The medication you took a few hours earlier to relieve the fever, sore throat,\
  \ dry cough and overall body pain kicked in and, for the first time in the last\
  \ three days, you managed to get out of bed and communicate, through speech, with\
  \ other humans. And the boy you thought didn\u2019t care to know your name actually\
  \ called you by it and offered to buy you a beer - it\u2019s a $1 draft beer in\
  \ a plastic cup, but it's much more: it\u2019s a conversation starter.\n\nAs you\u2019\
  re leaning on the counter with whom you hope becomes your Vegas one-night-stand\
  \ story, struggling to look charming but cool behind your red and swollen eyes,\
  \ your pupils may be dilated and trying to soak it all in. The impossibly bright\
  \ blue eyes of the boy are oh so close and dispute attention with the rest of the\
  \ lights in the old casino. You don\u2019t really know the name of the venue, and\
  \ that fact makes you realize you also are not sure of where you are. So, you begin\
  \ to scan the surroundings and the effort to focus demands that everything around\
  \ takes down a notch in volume, brightness and importance.\n\nThen, right in front\
  \ of you, is the peak behind the curtain. It\u2019s always been there, like it wasn\u2019\
  t well adjusted, but everyone ignores it for the sake of keeping the magic of the\
  \ show alive. But discovering the secret behind the spectacle is so seductive and,\
  \ when upon spotting the detail, you see a long gambling table, full of white men\
  \ with grey heads and small, skinny necks. They\u2019re only seen from behind, as\
  \ they don\u2019t move, don\u2019t look anywhere else, don\u2019t mind the slightly\
  \ drunk 20-something tourists speaking English in all accents right behind. Robotically\
  \ flipping cards, unbothered in their addiction.\n\nYour eyes wander a bit up and\
  \ you see the headliner: a woman with brown skin and a large figure wearing a black\
  \ lingerie set, embroidered with sparkling pieces that lost a lot of their shine.\
  \ She\u2019s not smiling, but not bitter. There\u2019s no expression on her face.\
  \ Standing on what could have been her center stage, she doesn\u2019t pose as a\
  \ muse: merely dances in slow motion, or perhaps walks following the rhythm of the\
  \ Las Vegas frantic and decadent melody, sedated in the middle of the hallucination.\n\
  \nImmediately, you come out of your Sin City high: you understood Las Vegas."
