Text: "It was a warm and a dark summer night. He came to welcome me to the little\
  \ harbor of San Pietro Island that I reached with the last ferry from another Island,\
  \ Sardinia. \nAs I shook his hand, I immediately recognized the resilience and authenticity\
  \ of a man belonging to the sea. Pietro, named as the island that inhabits, is a\
  \ fisherman who decided to transform his house into a receptive structure to be\
  \ able to meet in the guest\u2019s eyes which path of their life story that brought\
  \ them there. \nIn the car, reaching the b&b, the short conversation made me understand\
  \ that coming here by chance for a few days of relax, it turned out to be an exciting\
  \ journey of culture, history, traditions connecting with the tales of his wonderful\
  \ life experience. \nI slept with the impatience of know as much as possible about\
  \ the little town of Carloforte, I woke up with the smell of coffee came from the\
  \ kitchen and finally I met also Maria, Pietro's wife. She told me that she was\
  \ too curious to see me because Pietro had anticipated her \u201Cyou should see\
  \ the eyes of that girl, they seem to be talking\u201D. I sat at the garden table\
  \ and while I was eating my meal, I listened to the story of their personal life\
  \ blended with the history of how that place was born, when a little group of sailors\
  \ from Genoa direct to Tunisia wanted to colonize that territory, in order to have\
  \ a secure base from which to start their trades.\nEvery single day spent in San\
  \ Pietro Island was for me a source of knowledge and experience, I used every moment\
  \ in which I could entertain with them to listen their incredible tales enchanted,\
  \ how they welcomed with love all the things life gave them, always together, with\
  \ patience and devotion; living in a place far from the mainland and where there\
  \ is a special time that is marked by the arrival and restart of the ferries, by\
  \ the rules imposed by the sea and its conditions. Their stories allowed me to nourish\
  \ myself with the beauty and the joy of a life spent together for better or worse.\
  \ \nWhen arrived the moment of leave the magic of that little island, such a big\
  \ emotion came at the goodbye moment like a crescendo until I took my space on the\
  \ ferry, leaning on the parapet and having a last look at the light and colors of\
  \ Carloforte, when from distance I saw a white handkerchief waved in the air. She\
  \ was waving at me as if i were a daughter leaving from home. In that act I recognize\
  \ the strength and the love of Maria, an homage to the days we have spent together\
  \ and a way to remind me that no meeting is the result of chance."
