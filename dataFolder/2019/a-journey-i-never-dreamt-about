Text: "A journey I never dreamt about.  A young lady who grew up in one of the smallest\
  \ parts of town in Ghana, West Africa. While growing up without a father, all that\
  \ mattered to me was to grow up into a strong woman to take care of my mother but\
  \ I did not really know how. I went through schools though it wasn't easy but I\
  \ survived each time. Perseverance became my best friend as it was the only thing\
  \ I could keep with me. I finally came to one of the colleges in Ghana, and I happen\
  \ to be selected for an exchange program in the United States! It came as a dream\
  \ to me and until I got to the States, I  still feared and doubted as it was my\
  \ very first of travelling out of my country. \nI was feeling excited about the\
  \ whole thing happening but then again I was scared. I never felt that kind of fear\
  \ ever in my life. Even though most of the time, I was left to be by myself, for\
  \ the very first time, I was gripped with fear but I consoled in my best friend,\
  \ Perseverance to go through this journey that was ahead of me. On the day I was\
  \ suppose to leave on that plane, I cried, my tears was not because I was leaving\
  \ my mother and siblings behind but it was because, I couldn't tell what was going\
  \ to happen as I journeyed unto a land I never knew of. My first time being on that\
  \ plane and it was a mixture of sadness and excitement. The excitement was I was\
  \ gradually making my mother and my community proud and sad because, I was scared\
  \ of what was going to take place in this journey I was embarking on. \nAll said\
  \ and done, I got on that plane to Houston, Texas. Sitting all quiet on the plane,\
  \ I couldn't even eat and after five hours, landed in Amsterdam. While at the airport\
  \ in Amsterdam, since my flight to Houston was in two parts, I had to make a transit\
  \ at Amsterdam before boarding the next one to Houston, Texas. I checked my boarding\
  \ gate number and when I was ready to leave for inspection, I forgot! I had to return\
  \ back to check on the screen to make sure once more, and this time, I wrote it\
  \ down. I searched for my boarding gate and finally found it. While I sat and was\
  \ waiting for my flight, I kept on imaging what and how the place I am going looked\
  \ like. I had all sort of assumptions running through my head. After about three\
  \ hours of waiting, boarding begun, immediately, I felt like using the restroom.\
  \ I got on that plane ready to hit Houston, Texas in some few hours. I was able\
  \ to taste some food after sometime amidst my fears, yet I appeared to be so strong.\
  \ The moment I got to Houston, my coordinator came to get me at the airport and\
  \ she was very nice hence I was able to calm down a bit. What I had thought was\
  \ totally different from what I had seen. Well, there were some I didn't expect\
  \ to see though. My coordinator took me home to where the participants of the program\
  \ were suppose to lodge. I waited to see all the students coming from the rest of\
  \ the world but I realized I slept off. I woke up to realize someone sleeping in\
  \ the same room with me! With boldness on the outside and seriously shaking inside,\
  \ I smiled at her and we got to know each other and I met the rest of the students\
  \ as well. At least, I was made to understand I had a small family which were the\
  \ participants around me so somehow, I felt safe and my initial fears left me. I\
  \ decided later on to find my way around the city of Houston and to get to know\
  \ the people. I got lost on my very first day out but later got to realize there\
  \ some interesting facts about Houston.This was a journey I never dreamt about!"
