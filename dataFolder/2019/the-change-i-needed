Text: "The story of my travel is about a woman who always beleived in herself. A woman\
  \ who even though she had a very difficult experience as a little child, she grew\
  \ up as a  strong, beautiful and confident woman who, suddenly met who she thought\
  \ was her soulmate. This woman has always been encouraged by love. She experienced\
  \ the strongest feelings during the relationship with this man. When I say strongest\
  \ I mean the worst of them. Along the 3 years she spent with him she lost herself.\
  \ She gave all she had: her power, her selflove, her carisma, her body, her happiness,\
  \ and almost her life. She almost dissappeared. She was just a body walking and\
  \ working but almost acting like a robot. She was sick all the time with no hopes.\
  \ One day, she woke up and decided to end with this terrible episode of her life.\
  \ She wanted to survive, to recover that confidence and strength she used to have.\
  \ So at new years eve 2018-2019 she said: no more! And it was it. She finally said\
  \ goodbye to him, blocked him everywhere: mobile phone, Facebook, Instagram, deleted\
  \ his number. She also started a therapy to clean the hardest memories of him. She\
  \ was feeling so much better but she felt that she needed to do something else,\
  \ something more important and relevant for her. She needed to start a brand new\
  \ adventure. She decided to travel around to meet new people, have new conversations,\
  \ taste different gastronomical flavours, breathe a new fresh air, and walk around\
  \ beautiful places which will help her to be who She was. She decides to start this\
  \ adventure in Portugal, her favourite country. She has the feeling that She has\
  \ to back there, where She has always felt as She was at home: Lisbon, Setubal,\
  \ Faro, Alvor, Sintra, Casc\xE1is.....there\u2019s something very special about\
  \ this country, its land, people, air, Good and vibes. It\u2019s regenarating. She\
  \ decides to go there by car on her own. Grab some snacks, some water and redbull\
  \ for the drive, some cd\u2019s David Bowie, Lou Reed, Neil Young, Deep Purple and\
  \ let\u2019s roll. When she gets there she feels better already, just with the driving.\
  \ And once she puts a foot on that land she feels that there she will find what\
  \ she didn\u2019t expect to find.........\nBy the way, that woman is me."
