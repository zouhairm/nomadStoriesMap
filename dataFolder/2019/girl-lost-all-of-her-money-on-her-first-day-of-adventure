Text: "It was summer 2018. The setup for my trip to England from Colombia, had been\
  \ a long 4-month emotional rollercoaster. Not only was I studying, but I simultaneously\
  \ had spent months of grueling hours working as both an event planner, and a sales\
  \ person at a digital marketing firm. Nonetheless, the hard work had paid off. I\
  \ made enough money to pay for my trip, having a budget of \u20AC2,400 to last me\
  \ 2 months in Europe. This meant \u20AC40 a day. Enough to pay for a place to stay,\
  \ food and other expenses. As long as I could spend my days around Europe\u2019\
  s picturesque beaches, listening to music and making new friends, I was content.\
  \ \n\nMy excitement mounted. June 6th had arrived, and I was travelling to London.\
  \ My best friend, Soraya, whom I had not seen in years, was waiting for me at the\
  \ airport. We are polar opposites, but we complement each other perfectly. Our summer\
  \ itinerary was ready. All we needed was to start ticking off our bucket list. \n\
  \nFirst stop: Brighton. We took our train from Kings Cross St. Pancras and got to\
  \ our destination. As backpackers, our bags were light, knowing that there was the\
  \ possibility we would be adding to our bags as the trip progressed. We were staying\
  \ at a hostel called \u2018Baggies Backpackers Brighton\u2019, which was very close\
  \ to the train station in front of the beach therefore decided to walk. \n\nWhen\
  \ we got to the hostel's front desk, the receptionist, Mariana, asked for our names\
  \ to find our reservation. Soon after, we were taken to our shared room to leave\
  \ our bags, to go back down to pay. As I slid my hand into my pocket, my heart sank.\
  \ The money was gone. I remained calm, thinking I could have misplaced it. But alas,\
  \ my purple envelope was nowhere to be found. Panic attack. It was gone. \n\nA million\
  \ questions passed through my mind. After much thinking and a little bit of crying,\
  \ Soraya comforted me. I was not alone. You discover the true meaning behind the\
  \ word best friend when things go wrong. I knew I was lucky to have her, but never\
  \ had I been witness to the sheer immensity of how someone\u2019s heart could be\
  \ so loving and generous. Tip #1 it is very important to choose your travel partner\
  \ carefully to make sure this person will support you unconditionally because anything\
  \ can happen, but if you are with the right people, \u2018this too shall pass\u2019\
  . Now, if you are traveling by yourself, be sure that there are kind people in this\
  \ world who will be willing to help you. Luckily, it happened to us! As long as\
  \ you think about what is it that you need, you will immediately attract it. \n\n\
  What next? Step one: with extreme measure, we traced our steps back, but the envelope\
  \ was completely gone. Tip #2 Never carry your life savings in cash! Step two: do\
  \ not dwell on the past. It does a disservice to you. Start thinking about what\
  \ to do to solve the problem. \n\nWe had a total of \u20AC2400 left, enough money\
  \ to live for a month, so we still needed to figure out what to do for the second\
  \ month. What an exciting, yet all together terrifying experience. What appeared\
  \ to be a nightmare turned out to be a journey of self-discovery for both of us.\
  \ One of the most difficult challenges in this day and age is understanding the\
  \ fleeting existence of money. It comes and goes, but it depends on us as individuals,\
  \ and the type of energy we omit, in order to allow it to come back. \n\nMy strengths\
  \ are selling, and Soraya\u2019s is creativity. Therefore, we decided to invest\
  \ some money in clothing thrift shops, jewelry and recreated clothes that young\
  \ people could wear during the numerous festivals being held around Europe. Ultimate\
  \ result: get out of your comfort zone. Easy to say, very hard to apply, but very\
  \ rewarding. Things went better than expected, we recuperated more than what was\
  \ lost as we gained an experience, and realized our true capabilities whilst being\
  \ stuck in a rut."
