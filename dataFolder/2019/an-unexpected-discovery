Text: "Dear Sir/ Madam\n\nFirst of all, I wanted to tell you something about me. My\
  \ name is Yohan. I am 19.  I have Swiss (from my father\u2019s side) and Portuguese\
  \ roots  (from my mother\u2019s side). Furthermore, I was born and raised close\
  \ to Lausanne but I have always had a strong bound with Portugal because I\u2019\
  ve spent almost all my summer holidays in Lisbon, which is my favourite place in\
  \ the world by the way. I graduated from high school on June and now I am studying\
  \ English in Melbourne AU in order to obtain a CAE certificate (Cambridge advanced\
  \ English). \n\nMy story begins four years ago while I was driving with my grandparents\
  \ from Lisbon to Coimbra. During the travel I noticed an old abandoned accomodation\
  \ on our way. I remember to see a large amount of birds flying around and probably\
  \ inside the house as well. It simply did not belong to humans anymore. I have always\
  \ been really curious and sensible to seing old buildings falling apart. I always\
  \ imagine the stories and the families that may have lived there and I wonder why\
  \ it had been as curiously forgotten. To my mind, this old house was just another\
  \ historical treasure forgotten among others in Portugal.\n \nApproximately one\
  \ year later, while I was simply surfing on the Internet at home in Switzerland\
  \ I came across a new portuguese TV programme, which was about abandoned buildings.\
  \ One of the programmes was about an old accommodation that had a lot of secrets\
  \ to reveal. In fact, this spot was well-known before the end of the Salazar dictatorship\
  \ in the 70s. I discovered that several classic Portuguese movies had been recorded\
  \ there and so celebrities such as Amalia Rodrigues, who is the Queen of Fado and\
  \ also Fernando Farinha had sung there when the building wasn\u2019t only occupied\
  \ by seagulls. I was already impressed by those first facts but I got even more\
  \ excited when the cherry on the cake was revealed;Paul McCartney, my favourite\
  \ singer ever had been there during the 60s just as the Queen of England in the\
  \ 50s. After having watched the documentary I decided to google the place. I was\
  \ really astonished when I realised that this place was the one I had seen and dreamt\
  \ about on my way to Coimbra a year before.\n\nIt was too unbelievable to be missed\
  \ out. So in the following summer I decided to go there again and the place made\
  \ me feel a bit nostalgic when I  saw how ruined it was comparing to the old movies\
  \ that were recorded in there but on the other hand I was happy to stand in a place\
  \ where so many celebrities I admire had been as well. Afterwards I could not think\
  \ about anything but to the other houses that may keep secrets.\n\nTo conclude,\
  \ I hope that my story will be taken into consideration and that I will be provided\
  \ with the opportunity to improve not only my English and writing skills but also\
  \ my knowledges about Portugal, which is a country I\u2019ve always desired to discover\
  \ more and more because although I have never lived there I have always felt a sense\
  \ of belonging to this wonderful nation that let me with a feeling of \u201CSaudade\u201D\
  \ every time I leave it."
