Text: "It is december of 2009\u2026 It is late in the night... It is cold\u2026 I\
  \ just woke up, because of the noise and movement inside the bus\u2026 From the\
  \ window I can see the flag of Turkey as a dream (because I don\u2019t know if I\
  \ am wake or sleeping)... Am I in Istanbul? Not Yet, but on the way.... Stop\u2026\
  \ Everybody is jumping off from the bus... VISA time\u2026 Ok... Green VISA\u2026\
  \ We came inside... Sleep time again\u2026 I wake up again\u2026 Now it is early\
  \ in the morning... Everything is grey: clouds, buildings, smoke, pollution\u2026\
  \ Am I in Istanbul? Is this Istambul? Oh, my Gosh!!!! This is huge, is a giant town,\
  \ is the biggest town I had ever seeing on my life\u2026 I am on the top of some\
  \ huge circuit of road, and bridges... It is a Megalopole like I never saw before...\
  \ Yes\u2026 Down of all those roads where I am, I can see the bus station, it is\
  \ huge also!!! I never ever could imagine that was so big!!!... I had spend my less\
  \ Euro on this ticket from Athens/Greece to here... I was imagining that would be\
  \ easy to find money, to find the way to some hostel\u2026 But, it will be a \u201C\
  little bit\u201D more challenged\u2026 Stop\u2026 The bus station is like a town\
  \ on this own\u2026 They speak turkish... I have no money... Everything is write\
  \ on turkish\u2026 What to do? Idea! I must sell my Cell Phone\u2026 Negotiation\
  \ is on mime... I sell it... Now I have 17 turkish money... I have a japanese friend\
  \ with me\u2026 We met on the bus, during the trip\u2026 We are together now\u2026\
  \ She has a hostel booked\u2026 We went together by t\xE1xi\u2026 It is a huge and\
  \ magnificent town\u2026 Here are big buildings, old buildings, black sea, roads\
  \ and roads, the sky is blue, is cold, is windy, but not too much... It is christmas\
  \ time, but the mosques are singing another kind of music in between themselves\u2026\
  \ I am not used to hear it\u2026 I am in love for this city... On the hostel they\
  \ are lovely... I offer my services to exchange for my stay... They don\u2019t accept\
  \ it, and just let me stay for free... Whatever, I will get some money by my own,\
  \ from some how\u2026 They are lovely people\u2026 Now I have a warm bad, breakfast\
  \ every morning and good people around\u2026 I walk everyday in between the old\
  \ mosques and old neighbors, I don\u2019t eat to much, but everything that I eat\
  \ I love (the candys specially)... I am vegan... I love the food, the tea, the people\u2026\
  \ I feel my Self in home\u2026 Even that they don\u2019t speak my language, and\
  \ I don't speak they language also\u2026 We are communicating in some energetical\
  \ way\u2026 I love to be in here\u2026 A lot of restaurants, kebab stores, simpatic\
  \ people\u2026 I walk, walk, walk\u2026 Taksin... Uau!!!! It is very cosmopolitan\
  \ city, it is fantastic\u2026 Next day, public market.. Oh, my gosh!!! Huge and\
  \ exotic\u2026 The bridge by the black sea is wonderful\u2026 I can cross the ocean\
  \ and put my feet on Asia for the first time\u2026 I didn\u2019t\u2026 Next time\u2026\
  \ After all without money, I have some money again by transfer from my family\u2026\
  \ I paid all that I was on debit\u2026 Friends, hostel\u2026 When I put my hand\
  \ back into my pocket\u2026 Woo! Somebody Stole my 300 USD last\u2026 No!!!! I have\
  \ to leave this place\u2026 A friend hug me and without make me know, put some dollars\
  \ on my pocket in secret\u2026 It is the money that I use to go by metro until the\
  \ bus station and comeback to Greece, because there I have a fly to Lisbon, because\
  \ my friend from this town gave me that as a christmas gift\u2026 I have no money\
  \ to get to Athens\u2026 But everybody can see on my face that I am totally lost,\
  \ hunger and disappointed\u2026 They put me inside a bus to Athens without to ask\
  \ anything for it\u2026 I have no money again\u2026 I close my eye\u2026 I sleep\
  \ deep and soft and calm, hoping that I will wake up in Athens soon... End"
