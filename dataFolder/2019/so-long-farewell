Text: "Every year since I was five, my parents and I take an annual trip to Shantiniketan,\
  \ a small town in West Bengal put on the map by Rabindranath Tagore. The trips are\
  \ usually devoid of excitement, the sole purpose being escaping from the hustle\
  \ and bustle of the concrete jungle for a weekend in an effort to connect with nature.\
  \ Hence, the trip in February, I figured, it wouldn't be any different than the\
  \ rest.\nIt all began on the Saturday evening we reached the town, exhausted and\
  \ hungry after the 5 hour road trip. Yet Ma's spirit was undaunted and she coerced\
  \ Papa and myself to accompany her shopping. Thus, there we were, sitting in the\
  \ arena outside the store when I suddenly felt a tingling on my leg. I looked down\
  \ and noticed 4 puppies, barely a couple of months old, nibbling at my shoe probably\
  \ hunting for a morsel to eat. No sooner had I seen this than I ran to the nearby\
  \ shop and bought two packets of biscuits for them which they nibbled away within\
  \ seconds. It was absolutely apparent that they had not eaten awhile and were starving\
  \ until they started to chew on my shoe.\nAs cliche as it may sound, I did lose\
  \ track of time then. After what seemed like hours, Ma came outside with two giant\
  \ bags and was ready to go to our hotel and retire for the day. Amidst much protests\
  \ from me and Papa we bid the pups farewell after settling them inside the discarded\
  \ cardboard box for the night. Yet, the entire night I dreamt of the four little\
  \ animals and their eight starry eyes, looking longingly at me, trying to communicate\
  \ something long lost and long forgotten. \nThe next morning I hurriedly completed\
  \ my breakfast and taking the local rickshaw, made my way to the arena. As soon\
  \ as I reached, the little legs came running towards me. Oh their excitement! They\
  \ had remembered me, the stranger. I bent down and caressed all of them. This morning,\
  \ however, I was carrying some milk and bread and I stayed there till they lapped\
  \ up every single last drop. In the meantime, I had made up my mind that I would\
  \ take them back home to Kolkata; after all their mother was nowhere to be found\
  \ and I was not separating a happy family. I returned to the hotel and explained\
  \ my plan to my parents and keeping up with their nature, they utterly dismissed\
  \ my proposal.\nIt was Sunday afternoon already and time to return home. And for\
  \ the first time ever I did not feel like returning. The town suddenly felt important\
  \ and I did not want to leave. There were four little creatures who depended on\
  \ me and I was ready to abandon them! I felt selfish. I was not prepared to bid\
  \ them farewell.\nIn a few hours we had left the town behind and racing towards\
  \ the fast life of the city. It has been over a month now but I have not been able\
  \ to forget the eight longing eyes who had really thought that I had come as a means\
  \ of their rescue. \nI intend to go back to the town soon again, probably for the\
  \ first time, and meet my lost friends and apologise for abandoning them. Till then\
  \ I only have a photograph to cherish."
