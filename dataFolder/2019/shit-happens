Text: "A lost cell phone. Yet again, another lost cell phone. It shouldn\u2019t come\
  \ as a surprise really. However long the list of personal excuses might be -- from\
  \ psychiatry to astrology - the boyfriend wasn\u2019t buying the \u201Cmillennial\
  \ bullshit\u201D no more. \u201CPlease, not this time\u201D.  From the south of\
  \ Bahia up to Carnival in Olinda, we had a month and 1000 miles ahead of us. It\
  \ wouldn\u2019t be the first time we got a day too late to the airport \u2026 \u201C\
  Please, not this time\u201D. \n\nFocus; a personal mantra repeated to the detriment\
  \ of the most peculiar cumulus nimbus; \u201Cit kinda looks like Papa Smurf if you\u2026\
  \u201D FOCUS! Camping tent? Check! Flight schedules? Check! Itinerary? Check! All\
  \ on board. Seat belts fastened, rowdy ferry boats and outworn hitchhike thumbs\
  \ later; all seemed to go as planned. Despite that terrible\u2026 stomach bug\u2026\
  \ the first week... Maragogi. Less than 90 miles left. And: a lost cell phone.\n\
  \nWhat can I say? It is popular knowledge: sometimes, shit happens -- and that leads\
  \ me to the story.\n\n***\n\n\"Festejo\". Inebriated by the salty stickiness of\
  \ the sea breeze, the heavy sound of drums and coin filled cans strapped to the\
  \ villagers\u2019 ankles, a miscellanea of flamboyant ensembles and colorful ribbons\
  \ dancing on air (and more than a few \"caipirinhas\"); we hopped onto an acquaintance\u2019\
  s motorcycle rump and lost complete track of time\u2026  And the issued warning:\
  \ \n\n\u201CThe village is way too far and there\u2019s no transportation back after\
  \ the sun sets. Beware of it!\u201D\n\nWell, aware we were not. \n\n23 pm. No bus.\
  \ No cabs. No uber. \n\nCash? None. ATMs? Closed. Cell phone? Forgotten at a local\
  \ bar.\n\n\"Ay-me\", the struggles of the tech deprived traveler! (irony caps lock).\n\
  \n\u2018Cell-phoneless\u2019, cashless and worrisome; we sat at the beach to access\
  \ our situation. \n\n\u201CHey! You two. Do you guys play \"Purrinha\"?\u201D  Z\xE9\
  , a skinny older man shouted out from a group of fishermen gathered at the beach.\
  \ \n\nA shared pensive look. \u201CSure, why not... It\u2019s not like we\u2019\
  re going anywhere \u201D. \n\n\u201CAre you kids okay?\u201D\n\nAs we told the story\
  \ of our series of unfortunate events, Z\xE9 reassured us:\n\n\u201CRelax, now you\
  \ have company to pass time and lots of beers to make it pass faster! Let\u2019\
  s play!\u201D \n\nAs we played \"Purrinha\", a brazilian drawing straws game, Z\xE9\
  \ introduced us to the gang: \u201CBig-Mouth Katya\u201D, the hugger with a hyena\
  \ laugh, Regi the tell-tale fisherman, and Anonymous -- whose name remains a mystery.\
  \ \n\nSeveral rounds later, we were hungry. Couldn't deny it if we wanted to. Our\
  \ bellies roar spoke louder.  \n\n\u201CWorry not! We\u2019re gonna grab a bite\
  \ at a friend\u2019s house. Prepare to meet a local celebrity!\u201D\n\n***\n \n\
  \u201CBucket Shit Jack\u201D sat at his front porch. \n\nBig belly shirtless man,\
  \ beer in hand. The red cap and Magnum P.I. moustache made him look like a character\
  \ straight from a 70\u2019s \"pornochanchada\".  Big smile lights up at seeing his\
  \ \"compadre\". An even bigger welcome is extended to us. \n\nBellies filled, banter\
  \ exchanged \u2026\n\n\u201CSo\u2026 Bucket Shit? What\u2019s with the nickname?\u201D\
  \n\nThe story begins like a lothario novel. Older married guy, vestal young lady;\
  \ an affair. After \"drinking his weight in beer\" and having some not-so-fresh-fish-leftovers,\
  \ Jack decides to go see his lover. Hidden in her room, they share a moment and\
  \ Maria sleeps. Drunk, in the dark and locked inside, the fish-leftovers begin to\
  \ steer and Jack boldly claims the closest thing he finds as an impromptu toilet.\
  \ A bucket, \u201CThat\u2019ll do\u201D. Maria wakes up and the secret affair blows\
  \ up. Inside the now stained bucket: all of Maria\u2019s mother\u2019s hand embroidery\
  \ towel orders. \n\nAn enraged scream. A woken mother. A marriage destroyed.  A\
  \ new local legend.\n\n\u201CWhat can I say? Sometimes shit happens!\u201D\n\n***\n\
  \nSunrise. Hangover, sand all over our faces, the town\u2019s dogs surrounding us\u2026\
  \ \n\n\u201CFind the cell phone!\u201D\n\nThe bar owner told us to check with Andre\
  \ at the hostel. The hostel staff told us Andre wasn\u2019t working today. \u201C\
  Check with the hippies, they know everybody\u201D. The hippies told us to check\
  \ with the bakery lady; \u201CI think they\u2019re friends\u201D. The bakery lady\
  \ finally knows something.\n\n\u201CHe\u2019s probably home. He lives up that street,\
  \ right by Bucket Shit\u2019s house.\u201D \n\n[\u2026]\n\n\u201CWhat can I say?\
  \ Sometimes shit happens!\u201D\n\nAnd I\u2019m glad it did."
