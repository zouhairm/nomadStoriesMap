Text: "Manzanillo sits along the Costa Rican coastline, a 40 minute bus ride south\
  \ from the town of Puerto Viejo.  Both towns give visitors a lazy beach town experience,\
  \ but Puerto Viejo offers them what could only be described as more. On the surface,\
  \ it seems to be a lazy beach town, but it is one that comes to life with the noise\
  \ and bustle, the presence of tourists. The  center of Puerto Viejo is dominated\
  \ by shops that  brim with things for people looking to take something home; a patterned\
  \ headband, a t-shirt bearing the words \u2018pura vida\u2019, a beach towel printed\
  \ to look like Costa Rican currency.\n\tManzanillo, however, offers visitors a slightly\
  \ different beach town feel. The kinds of stores that are in Puerto Viejo just aren\u2019\
  t in Manzanillo \u2013 at least, not in those numbers. Stepping off the bus in Manzanillo\
  \ feels like you are stepping back in time. The place almost feels rudimentary.\
  \ Many of the buildings are made of wood, their paint jobs worn through from the\
  \ salty sea air.\n\tBack in late 2014, a group of us ventured from Puerto Viejo\
  \ to Manzanillo in search of something different, something more rustic than Puerto\
  \ Viejo. Upon first arriving, we noticed that the area surrounding the bus stop\
  \ didn\u2019t offer much. With barely a decent place to stop for lunch, nothing\
  \ made us linger very long in town and we made our way to the beach shortly after\
  \ arriving in Manzanillo.\n\tThe beach, too, was nothing like we\u2019d expected\
  \ it to be. The sand was littered with dead trees and dried pieces of wood that\
  \ cut into our feet as we walked. None of us  could walk without flip-flops. We\
  \ must have looked like a caravan, kicking up sand as our flip-flops clicked as\
  \ we walked in search of something, anything, that would have made this outing worth\
  \ leaving the aforementioned Puerto Viejo.\n\tWe just knew that we had to keep heading\
  \ south along the beach. There, it was said, was something worth looking at, something\
  \ that would make the trip worth it.\n\tAs if the day couldn\u2019t get anymore\
  \ gloomy, it started to rain. We kept going on the advice of one of our travel companions.\
  \ Just ahead, a little further down the beach, he said, we would find something\
  \ that would make the trip worth our time.\n\tNot only had it started to rain that\
  \ day, but it had, in fact, been raining quite a lot lately, as one would expect\
  \ during a rainy season in the tropics.  An estuary had swelled between our side\
  \ of the beach and the side we were meant to visit. Fed by the recent rain, brown\
  \ water swirled and mixed with the ocean water. It would have been waist deep if\
  \ we decided to risk it.\n\t\u201CThis is where crocodiles live,\u201D someone mentioned.\n\
  \t\u201CWe could get swept out to sea,\u201D said someone else thinks to add.\n\t\
  A woman laughed at us nearby under the security of her umbrella, where she sold\
  \ home cooked empanadas.\n\t\u201CIt\u2019s the only way across,\u201D she told\
  \ us, her face shining at us through the gloomy mist.\n\tWas it worth the risk?\n\
  \tSome travel days end without new experiences.  Sometimes the rough is rougher\
  \ than you were ready for. We headed back to our bus stop, soaking wet from the\
  \ rain, the woman under the umbrella getting a hearty laugh at our expense. The\
  \ only story I have from Manzanillo is how I almost got to the tip of Manzanillo."
