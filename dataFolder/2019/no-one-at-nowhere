Text: "A dark winter night of April, in Takht Bhai- an archeologicalky well-known\
  \ city of Pakistan-, with exceptional lightening and scary alleys, I scuffled through\
  \ the crowd, ankled one after the other and reached a middle point to which all\
  \ the people around me were looking deeply, irrespective of revulsive smell coming\
  \ from the dark matter. It was not the dark matter but I called it so. Although,\
  \ I don't know what would the rest of the people have named it. The matter was in\
  \ liquid form, with reflection of the crowd and, subsequently, me too. I wasn't\
  \ week too look at it. Perhaps, I took more interest in that, regardless of its\
  \ spoiled nature. Despite, the spoiler alert, I leaned over it, went closer and\
  \ closer to check up on it. The more I reflected myself, the more I was flabbergasted.\
  \ Sooner or later, dialogue took place. Whether it was a dialogue or monologue is\
  \ still a confusing question. \nI asked myself, perhaps the 'me' inside me: \"what\
  \ is it?\"\nHe answered: \" a story with that began with B and will end with D.\
  \ It is just the C that matters in between.\"\n\"When did it begin?\", Curiously,\
  \ he put forth.\n\" With God, I replied.\n\" Where was God?\", He enquired.\n\"\
  He is self-existent and existed since billions of years, without any creator\"\n\
  \" Why did He create you?\"\n\" For himself, to worship him and teach a lesson to\
  \ Adam, who disobeyed him in Heaven.\"\n\"Who's Adam\"\n\" You and I are Adam\"\
  , I answered.\n\"Where are you, now?\"\n\"In the nowhere zone\"\n\"What is that\
  \ place?\"\n\"It is a location defined by no one \"\n\"Who is no one?\n\"The one\
  \ who's asking questions about himself and his Creator\"\nHe continued asking questions\
  \ one after the other and wanted to satiate himself, his hunger of knowledge and\
  \ curiosity. Unfortunately, someone walked beside the repugnant water and distorted\
  \ the image, killed the person in his young age. He died in as a hungry man. Would\
  \ that be a death caused by undernourishment in the intellectual field.? Would there\
  \ be any light in the sphere of his realm? \nPerhaps, there would be not."
