Text: "I was lost. Alone in what was yet to become my favourite city in the world.\
  \ In an unfamiliar place, without language, and without WIFI. Years of relying on\
  \ google maps to navigate my own small city had ingrained in me the fact that I\u2019\
  m hopeless with directions. \n\nApprehensive and overly cautious, I began searching.\
  \ With each wrong step, I allowed myself to be drawn deeper into a sea of uneasiness.\
  \ Advice from back home had me scrutinising the faces of those around me, \u2018\
  never let people think you are lost.\u2019 \n\nThe thoughts continued to circle\
  \ in my mind, and evidently my path seemed to follow in the same motion. It was\
  \ the third time that I\u2019d found myself face to face with Portuguese Hard Rock\
  \ caf\xE9. The previous two times, I\u2019d ignored the opportunity before me out\
  \ of sheer reluctance to associate myself with a commercialised global chain while\
  \ in Porto. But I wasn\u2019t about to pass it up again. I went to connect to the\
  \ WIFI.\n\nPassword locked. \n\nDaylight was beginning to fade. The little that\
  \ remained painted the old city a soft purple grey and I was struck by a new wave\
  \ of appreciation for this beautiful place. The Porto I had come to know over these\
  \ past few days, refreshingly honest and open-hearted, like its people. Unpretentiously\
  \ pretty, it\u2019s charm fostered in boutique stores selling hand-made jewellery\
  \ and cork belts, in our local 'pastelaria' where a friendly employee taught me\
  \ how to pronounce 'bola de Berlim', the phrase for my new favourite Portuguese\
  \ pastry, and in the car of our delightful taxi driver, who, within a 30-minute\
  \ car trip gave us a most cherished introduction to the city. \n\n\LThis same taxi\
  \ driver, had also impressed upon us one particularly valuable piece of advice.\
  \ She told us that the renowned Cl\xE9rigos tower, no more than a few streets from\
  \ our apartment, can be seen from just about everywhere in the city. Meaning that\
  \ while the tower is within our sight, we will have no trouble finding our way back\
  \ home. \n\nWithout doubt, I seemed to be in one of the few areas in which the tower\
  \ cannot be seen. However, I was not dissuaded. Certain parts of this city have\
  \ resonated with me, and they have done so without any conscious effort. They remain\
  \ deep in my soul, guiding me in the form of intuition. A quaint little antique\
  \ shop, the rich, sugar fuelled aroma of port wine tastings, or perhaps something\
  \ as simple as the intangible feel of a street. Following these sporadic impulses,\
  \ I put more and more distance between myself and Hard Rock caf\xE9. \n\nFresh sea\
  \ breeze swept softly through my hair, and with it came the melodious sounds of\
  \ unbridled Portuguese. I drifted ever onward, passing bar after bar, allowing myself\
  \ to be absorbed in letting the day unwind, just like those around me. \n\nBarely\
  \ out of sight, the Cl\xE9rigos tower emerges from the city skyline, reaching up\
  \ towards the clouds. Its peak, the crown of this city, overlooking the whole of\
  \ Porto."
