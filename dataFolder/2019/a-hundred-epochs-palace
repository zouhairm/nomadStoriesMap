Text: "To give or not to give, that was my question.\n\nI was in front of this neoclassic\
  \ fa\xE7ade, which looks like everything but a cemetery, even outside, the vibe\
  \ was really strong. It was everything and anything. \n\nAs soon as I came in, a\
  \ mist of feelings shot me \u2013 sadness, agony, love, lack of love and happiness-.\n\
  \nAt first, these feelings were too much for me and, surrounded by all these tourist\
  \ and locals, I just stood there for a second, which felt like an eternity, took\
  \ a deep breath and look around.\n\nIt was beautiful; all this nature around its\
  \ mausoleums, the history and stories of the country bury in the same place and\
  \ the detailed and full of bronze and marble architecture. A true piece of art.\
  \ \n\nTo give an opportunity to Buenos Aires\u2019 ghosts was not on my bucked list,\
  \ but If I did not I couldn\u2019t appreciate the streets, gardens and architecture,\
  \ that caught me at first sight, of this Latino American necropolis. \n\nI said\
  \ yes to them.\n\nWhen I realized what I had done the time stops and felt that in\
  \ any second art critics, poets reciting their most famous poems and politicians\
  \ arguing about actual times were about to be heard. All of this while the daughter\
  \ of an aristocrat was playing the piano and her sister singing. \nIt was petrifying\
  \ enough to make me run away but the entrance was too far and I was already exited\
  \ for discover the secrets hidden inside the cemetery. \nBetween mortals and immortals,\
  \ and without even know, the most famous mausoleum was in front of me, Evita Per\xF3\
  n, and a few meters away Vicente Lopez and their national anthem. \n\nSome of the\
  \ flower in Evita\u2019s grave were fresh but the others were dead. I imagined Evita\
  \ taking and giving them at night to the children that play around the cemetery\
  \ streets, meanwhile she argues the national anthem with Vicente Lopez and asks\
  \ him if the current society was what he taught it would be.  I let them guide my\
  \ steps thru the cemetery, showed me the most beautiful secrets and introduce me\
  \ to my next guide.\n \nDefinitely all ghosts traveling with me did not understand\
  \ why the faces of mortals changed with every step they took.  Why their heart appears\
  \ to stop. Or maybe, just maybe, they have just preferred to ignored all of this.\
  \ But they kept walking with us.\n\nAlthough its wicked vibe, it is the most beautiful\
  \ place I have ever been. But all yin has their yang, and when I turned around I\
  \ was about to cry because of all the mixed feelings inside me and inside the place.\n\
  \nI looked around a few seconds before looking back and saying good bye to the beautiful\
  \ fa\xE7ade, its aisles and gardens. I heard laughter and critics for the last time,\
  \ but besides all of this, I admired all this stunning mausoleums that give a penetrant\
  \ vibe in locals and tourists.\n\nI said good bye to one of the most famous cemetery\
  \ of the world, to a palace of a hundred epochs and its eternal parties.\n\nI said\
  \ good bye to recoleta\xB4s cemetery to welcome the gardens of Buenos Aires."
