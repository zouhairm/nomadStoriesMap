Text: "I went traveling with a friend. We start our trip from Jakarta and fly to Pangkalanbun,\
  \ Central Borneo. We rent a local boat called \"klotok\". We stay on the boat for\
  \ 3 days 2 night and discover the river next to Tanjung Puting National Park - a\
  \ tropical rainforest. We paid for all in, with the captain, crew, cook and guide.\
  \ Also for meals and entry ticket to the national park. So we just enjoying the\
  \ trip. We can find tarantulas, monkeys, squirrels and many kind species of animals\
  \ and plants - of course, the most incredible is wild orang utan who live free in\
  \ the forest. It's very beautiful moment! Stay on the boat and go discover the river\
  \ with tropical rainforest view. At the third days, we back to the port and leave\
  \ the boat.\nWe fly to Surabaya the day after and take a look in the city and continue\
  \ to Pasuruan, where the Bromo tour will start. Bromo is about the sulphuric crater\
  \ and volcano. We start quite early with the jeep we rent with the driver, and we\
  \ have 3-4 points in the tour. The landscape in Bromo is the view you will never\
  \ can imagine. It's fantastic!\nWe continue to Malang city. Not many things you\
  \ can do there. We go to small complex temples. But we can do pedestrian walk and\
  \ find an antique small shop during walk. We also find an appropriate places to\
  \ eat, not that expensive. We spend time with visiting \"Colorful Village\" and\
  \ \"Blue Village\". The name describe it all.\nThis time for Yogyakarta! We like\
  \ the atmosphere of the city. In the city center it might be crowded and touristic,\
  \ but if you go discover the alleys, it can be different story. We also can find\
  \ beer easily in this city. We visit Borobudur - Buddhist temple and Prambanan -\
  \ Hindu temple. Both are biggest temples in Indonesia. Lava tour is worth to try\
  \ and rent a jeep and the driver is a must because the difficult terrain. You'll\
  \ pass the same route as lava when the mount is eruption. \nThen we go ahead south\
  \ of Yogyakarta region, Gunungkidul. We rent a bamboo cottage with sea view from\
  \ balcony. It's a right place to find tranquility. The weakness is bunch of aggressive\
  \ mosquito, so prepare your repellent. We can climbing the cliff to get discover\
  \ another beaches and the view from the top of the cliff is amazingly beautiful\
  \ with the wide sea landscape. The beaches can counted as clean though there still\
  \ some plastics. I find beach birds, crabs hiding in the cliff's holes, fishes,\
  \ seaweeds, snails, hermit crabs and stray dog! Never see a dog in the shore before.\
  \ He goes beyond the leap to his unknown, not his place at all, but still might\
  \ he belongs to be.\nThe dogs continue the journey to the east - Bali, and stop\
  \ in Ubud for a while, to see rice terraces, monkey forest, art museum, and many\
  \ Hindu temples. We like to walk and this is a good place to walk, near to the rice\
  \ field in a small calm quiet road.\nOur final destination is crossing the strait\
  \ to the east, Nusa Penida - small lonely island with amazing vibes. The beaches\
  \ are extremely beautiful. The way to reach the beach is another attraction too,\
  \ we have to go down from the cliff and have to climb about 200-250 meters to get\
  \ back. The color composition is like the beach you always dream every night. The\
  \ sand is quite soft. Almost no plastics. The beach creatures is enormous. Not everyone\
  \ can reach the beaches because the terrain. We also have the most amazing waterfall\
  \ complex we've ever seen. My partner loves it very much. It's quite and calm. It's\
  \ all about beach, sea, cliffs, blue and marine. Manta Bay - great place to snorkel,\
  \ swimming with Manta Ray fishes, like a black blanket in the sea. The rest of all,\
  \ we take a rest in a cafe on the cliff until the sunset. Sunset means night. Night\
  \ means tomorrow. Tomorrow means we have to go back. Going back is about start a\
  \ new journey. And we have to go again."
