Text: 'The journey of many firsts


  Up down around and around, it felt like being in a washing machine, the catermorang
  whisked through the current seamlessly. I have never been on a boat that went so
  fast before. The only comparable I can make is to the sensation of being on a wild
  horse, a mixture of exhilaration,excitement and nausea. I felt like I was going
  to get sick.


  One hour later we arrived at the base of the beach looking up onto a steep gradient
  ahead looking down on myself and the travel companions beneath. And there we jumped
  onto a cable cart and up up up we went. The great philosopher Aristotle once said
  "the roots are bitter but the fruit is sweat". The Journey to the beautiful Capri
  was pretty bitter but I can firmly attest that the fruit was certainly sweet. Lemons
  everywhere until the eye can see, at the top falling from trees,along the pebbled
  footpaths , on sale everywhere. Lemons were used for everything and anything ; sweets,candles,ornaments
  which were being sold by local street merchants.


  I remember the beautiful citrus aroma ,the clear sea air flourishing your senses.
  Capri is a vacuum of designer fashion  brands,beautiful ambiance and wherever you
  look eye melting views and scenery of various boats anchored off of the coast line.
  It felt like being in a Dior commercial.


  Being in Capri ,Italy was magical. It felt like coming home. This journey was one
  of many firsts, the catermorang,lemon sweets and true beauty.'
