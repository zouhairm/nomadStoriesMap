Text: "Do you ever wander what's the distance between Portugal and Brazil is? According\
  \ to Google, the regular distance is 7,470 kilometers, while the air travel one\
  \ is 4,642 miles long, roughly. Take that in consideration, alongside almost 520\
  \ years of shared history and language. Still, it is a country I'm mostly unfamiliar\
  \ about. Even though we share a big part of our history with Portuguese's, I barely\
  \ know them. \n\nI'd like to take a plane, fly over there and just explore whatever\
  \ comes in my mind, but also explore to discovery something new, find a lot of things\
  \ I don't fully comprehend yet. First, the most important to me, the country's art\
  \ history (museums, theaters, movies, etc). That's where you can track the best\
  \ work from a society. Second, the history of the country itself. I know enough\
  \ from Brazilian history books, but not enough to properly understand Portugal as\
  \ it's on thing. I'd eagerly explore all the libraries and second hand book stores,\
  \ making my way throughout history pathways onto the country. \n\nThird, the other\
  \ best way to discover another culture and country it's through it's food. I'm super\
  \ curious when it comes to food, always paying attention to the minimum details,\
  \ so I can recreate the dish again. Fourth, I'd let myself free for a whole day,\
  \ just to explore the city like a local. I never have a chance to do none of those\
  \ things when I'm traveling with my family, but on my own terms, I'd totally exclude\
  \ myself from a traveler position and take in the city's schedule instead. I think\
  \ that's a clever way to explore a place you're not familiar with or one you're\
  \ never been.\n\nLast but not least, I'd like to leap into the unknown and discover\
  \ my origins. I never made a proper family tree, so I don't know where I'm from.\
  \ But Brazil was colonized by Portugal and if my ancestors are from there, I'd like\
  \ to know that. Right now, I'm in a moment of my life where I'm trying really hard\
  \ to understand my place in this gigantic world. The thing is, both my past and\
  \ future seems really blurry and I'm really lost on where to go next. \n\nTraveling\
  \ is something different for every person and if opportunity is given to me, I'd\
  \ made this a powerful transformation moment to find out who am I and what I can\
  \ be in this world. I long everyday for a way to escape from my currently situation.\
  \ This world be a wonderful opportunity and a kick start into the next stage of\
  \ my life. Also, I'd give me a different perspective from the world. This wonderful,\
  \ messy and incredible world we all life in. It's so big and I'm longing to explore\
  \ every part, discovery every culture, meet every people from it."
