Text: "There is no \u2018jumping\u2019 or \u2018stepping\u2019 into the unknown, it\u2019\
  s always a large leap of faith and courage \u2013 just within physical comfort.\
  \ My leap into the unknown started as I leapt off a regional train in Bulgaria onto\
  \ the hard concrete of Cherepish station. \n\nAs I travel I like to get off the\
  \ beaten track and push myself out of my comfort zone, last year this included flying\
  \ to Bulgaria and staying a night in a remote monastery in the small town of Cherepish,\
  \ about 3 hours outside of Sofia. After doing some research and enlisting the native\
  \ Bulgarian speakers at my hostel in Sofia to confirm that I was able to stay at\
  \ Cherepish Monastery in Bulgaria, I purchased my train tickets and set out on the\
  \ three hour journey. When I thought travelling to the secluded Monastery was a\
  \ leap of faith, I didn\u2019t know what was in store for me once I actually got\
  \ there. \n\nCherepish station was merely a concrete platform displaying a perennial\
  \ timetable, however the immense Balkan Mountains splayed around the station were\
  \ such an extraordinary sight. As I started walking towards the monastery I noticed\
  \ the only buildings in town were abandoned and in various stages of decay, it created\
  \ an eerie excitement. On arrival I walked to the only person I would see during\
  \ my stay, motioned sleeping and said \u201CEdna nosht\u201D (one night) and was\
  \ shown to my room. I had a 7pm curfew and was to leave at 7 in the morning!\n\n\
  After dumping my bags I explored the monastery cemetery and 17th century church.\
  \ Cherepish Monastery is located on the banks of the Iskar River so I waded into\
  \ the water and watched the water flow downstream. I could see stairs leading to\
  \ a higher vantage point and with the hopes of a beautiful view I climbed up to\
  \ find the monastery ossuary displaying bones of Bulgarian soldiers. A leap of the\
  \ unknown is about trusting myself and my instincts \u2013 the ossuary freaked me\
  \ out so I quickly left.\n\nAs I explored more of Cherepish around the station I\
  \ discovered a dingy path barely visible through overgrown plants on either side.\
  \ Whilst wanting to walk through it I kept thinking to myself \u201CGoing down a\
  \ dark path in the middle of nowhere is how missing travelers end up on the news.\u201D\
  \ I ended up going down the path, despite the risk, as taking that leap is about\
  \ knowing I can\u2019t plan or prepare for everything and that moments of anxiousness\
  \ are only fleeting. The risk paid off and I found myself on the rocky banks of\
  \ the Iskar River, right underneath the train line. I could feel calm rush over\
  \ me as the water rushed downstream.\n\nI made it back by curfew and planned to\
  \ catch the early train and leave before 7am, however, when I tried to leave the\
  \ building a stray dog awoke outside, barking and charging at me. I slammed the\
  \ door shut and brainstormed how to leave without getting bitten by the dog. Short\
  \ of breaking a window there was no other way, as the building was partially underground.\
  \ I went back to my room and heard the early train come and leave. Eventually I\
  \ could hear another door open and thought if someone else is able to leave, the\
  \ dog must be gone. I raced down the stairs and flew out the door, my heart beating\
  \ loudly as I didn\u2019t want the dog to return.\n\nBy now I have 2.5 hours to\
  \ kill until the next train to I stayed on the banks of the Iskar in the spot I\
  \ found the day earlier, then explored the nearby abandoned buildings. I eventually\
  \ made my way back on the train, heading to Sofia.\n\nLeaping into the unknown connected\
  \ me with a new culture, language, religion and peacefulness despite moments of\
  \ anxiousness. I learned to trust my instincts whilst expanding my notions of what\
  \ I can and can\u2019t do. I thought my leap of faith was coming to Cherepish but\
  \ going down the abandoned pathway, finding the hidden ossuary and running from\
  \ the aggressive dog all became their own leaps into the unknown."
