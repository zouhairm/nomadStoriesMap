Text: "The way the world works, that dwarfs live alongside the giants. And no matter\
  \ how hard people are constantly trying to compete with nature, building skyscrapers\
  \ higher and higher. In terms of greatness, they always lose. The true greatness\
  \ is fully felt, being in the Black Forest, a resort area in southwestern Germany.\
  \ It is located in the federal state Baden-W\xFCrttemberg on the border with France\
  \ and Switzerland.\n1.5 hours from Zurich, and you find yourself in a medieval city,\
  \ almost untouched by time - Waldshut-Tinegen. Actually, these are two small towns.\
  \ But their neighborhood is so close that it is simply impossible to imagine them\
  \ apart. You start the walk in Waldshut, and after 15 minutes, or even less you\
  \ find yourself in Tiengen.\nThey are located on the banks of the Rhine. So don\u2019\
  t refuse the pleasure of walking along the river, where you can meet a couple of\
  \ swans swimming slowly. Tourists can take a 2-hour boat trip to feel the full power\
  \ of the Rhine.\nI stayed in the small village, called Gurthweil. From Waldshut-Tingen\
  \ it takes 30- minutes on foot and about 10 minutes by car. Gurtweil is built up\
  \ with two- and three-storey cottages. Their owners usually work in the capital\
  \ of Baden-W\xFCrttemberg, Freiburg or in the cities of Switzerland: Zurich and\
  \ Basel.\nAnd they come home to relax from the hustle and bustle of a big city.\
  \ Tidy side-streets, fragrant rhododendron bushes blossom in April, the murmur of\
  \ underground water streams coming out (they are surrounded by wooden picket-fences).\
  \ \nNot far from Waldshut, in the woods, there is an open-air cage with animals,\
  \ called Wildgehe, where fallow deer, wild goats, bison, bears, etc., walk freely.\
  \ This is a paradise for children: a rope park, swings; animals can be fed by food,\
  \ purchased here. Parents, meanwhile, can quietly rest in an outdoor caf\xE9, from\
  \ where a playground is perfectly visible. \nHowever, the favorite of mine is zoo\
  \ in Gurtvayle. It is located in the territory of Caritas. Despite this, people\
  \ often come here for a walk. In comparison to Wildgehe where animals are so well-fed,\
  \ that chew fodder reluctantly. In this place you\u2019ll feel like a rescuer of\
  \ all fauna! Wild goats, sheep and other animals fight for food, sometimes it seems\
  \ to jump out of the enclosure.\nThere are also swings, flowering shrubs and well-groomed\
  \ trees. I discovered an unusual path leading to a spring. It is a salvation for\
  \ tired travelers. Take off your sneakers and let's go together! On this way you\
  \ can experience different feelings, because one part of the path consists of pine\
  \ cones, the others are of wood chipper, smooth pebbles, spruce needles and at last\
  \ your feet gently sink in warm sand. Finally, we are at the spring. I jump from\
  \ stone to stone and quickly rinse my feet with icy water. It invigorates incredibly!\n\
  15-minute walk and I\u2019m going through the forest. The area is mountainous here,\
  \ so the twisting path is rising up. In the heart of the Black Forest, you hear\
  \ the sound of rapidly flowing streams. There are many springs, so you can often\
  \ see the signs \xABWasserschutz\xBB - water protection. \nI did it! Victory! I\
  \ am standing at one of the upper points of the Black Forest. Before me is a wide\
  \ clearing. I'm sitting under a branchy oak. From here you can take a view of all\
  \ the surroundings. The towns, Waldshut and Tingen, look tiny. The spire of the\
  \ town hall, the dome of the stone Catholic church, the castle ... Listen the rustling\
  \ of leaves, lift up your eyes to the tops of huge trees. It seems the movement\
  \ in the whole world has stopped, and you are here and now, far away from all your\
  \ worries and challenges that life presents.\nIf travelling with the backpack behind\
  \ shoulders is not your style, there are 2 highways through the Black Forest, which\
  \ can be taken to come back to the city. So there are no obstacles for everyone\
  \ to hear the song of the Black Forest by riding or walking!"
