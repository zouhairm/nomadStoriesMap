Text: "I let out a slight sneeze as the dust billowed around the shaky tuk-tuk heading\
  \ up a windy one-lane road to a small hilltop village in Chiang Mai. As we winded\
  \ along the road, our surroundings changed from clearly commercial to lush green\
  \ jungle until we ended in an area that was a far cry from what my mind considered\
  \ residential, but as the tuk-tuk came to a stop, our driver squashed that idea\
  \ with one shaky English sentence.\n\n\u201CWelcome to the Don Kaeo Tambon Village.\u201D\
  \n\nVillage. The word indicated people lived in the tiny Thai community, but as\
  \ I glanced around at the makeshift homes with aluminum roofs, I saw more stray\
  \ dogs than people.\n\n\u201CMa-nee-SEE. Come here,\u201D yelled Joe, the tuk-tuk\
  \ driver.\n\nMy companion and I followed his voice, and rounded a corner onto a\
  \ small lane lined with overgrown greenery and, to our surprise, bright red poinsettias.\n\
  \nIn awe, I shouted, \u201CJoe, in the U.S., I\u2019ve never seen these outside\
  \ of a store at Christmastime!\u201D He just nodded and continued along with winding\
  \ path.\n\nThe sun bore down harder as we followed Joe along the dusty road learning\
  \ about the local tribal people (who we had yet to see) and the livelihoods they\
  \ tended to gravitate towards. Just as Joe began to tell us about the trek down\
  \ the mountain the tribal people took each day (so that\u2019s where they all were!),\
  \ we rounded a corner and in the midst of what seemed like a lot of nothing was\
  \ a local coffee shop, complete with a seating area and menu.\n\nAs we approached,\
  \ a small balding man emerged from the front of the shop and greeted us.\n\n\u201C\
  Sa-wa-dee-khrup! Kao-maaaaa. Come in,\u201D he said as he gestured to the back of\
  \ the shop.\n\nWe walked through to the back and took a seat, as the small balding\
  \ man followed. He stopped near the table to hand us a short menu and stood by as\
  \ we perused the list.\n\n\u201COne espresso. One Americano. Both with milk, please,\u201D\
  \ I said, as I pointed to the menu to help him understand.\n\nHe bowed, walked away,\
  \ and headed inside, while Joe wandered over and took a seat next to us in the shade.\n\
  \n\u201CI can\u2019t believe there is a coffee shop all the way up here. How many\
  \ people visit this area? Do the locals come here too?\u201D I asked, still in awe\
  \ that a village of maybe 100 people had a full-service shop.\n\nJoe pointed out\
  \ over a rickety wooden fence through the trees to what looked like a giant soil\
  \ sifter.\n\n\u201CYou-see-that?\u201D Joe asked in what sounded like one word.\
  \ \u201CThat\u2019s coffee beans. Coffee grinds. In Thailand we love coffee, so\
  \ strong coffee. We grind it, sell it, but more serve it. We love when people try\
  \ it. Not Starbucks!\u201D he laughed.\n\nI took a minute, pulled out my phone,\
  \ and did a quick google search for coffee production in Thailand. To my surprise,\
  \ all-knowing Wikipedia confirmed the very thing Joe had mentioned. I read from\
  \ the page to my friend sitting across the table, \u201CThailand, formerly Siam,\
  \ is one of the top coffee producers in the world as of 20-14. The country is ranked\
  \ third among the coffee producing countries of Asia \u2026\u201D\n\nJoe leaned\
  \ back with a knowing look and smirked. \u201CChi. Yes. I said that.\u201D\n\nAs\
  \ I sat there on the tree stump being used as a seat, I laughed, and thought about\
  \ the tribal people who ventured down the mountain earlier that day who would come\
  \ back sometime after dark to grind coffee beans to sell to travelers and friends,\
  \ all to share a little piece of Thailand with them.\n\nJust as I was about to ask\
  \ Joe how he liked his coffee, the aroma of fresh brew filled my nose, and the small\
  \ balding man reappeared from inside the shop with four cups on a platter: an espresso,\
  \ an Americano, a cup for Joe, and another for himself. He placed the cups on the\
  \ table, and without a word, sat down next to us, took a long sip, and sighed as\
  \ he settled in next to us."
