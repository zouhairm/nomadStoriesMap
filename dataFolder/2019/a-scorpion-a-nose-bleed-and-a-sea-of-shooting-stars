Text: "I had dreamt of Morocco my whole life. My most vivid dreams rested on what\
  \ I knew of the country. Little did I know, though, that this adventure would lie\
  \ in the journey itself. By that point, after 13 hours in the air, 3 countries,\
  \ and 2 continents, my friend Kirsty and I were relieved to have arrived. Casablanca\u2019\
  s proximity to the sea accompanied the hot Moroccan air with a light, cool breeze,\
  \ offering a gentle calm to our short taxi to the train station. We drove through\
  \ the city to the highway, the road sprinkled with tiny houses and countless Moroccan\
  \ flags. \n\nWe arrived at the station, found a cafe, ordered mint tea, and waited\
  \ amongst the sun-drenched tilework for the train to Marrakech. Once aboard, we\
  \ stuffed our luggage into any space it would fit, my oversized suitcase sharing\
  \ my cramped seat, and set off. A while later, stopped at a rural station for over\
  \ an hour, we learned the train had broken down. We joined the other confused passengers\
  \ outside to find an answer when a group of Spanish backpackers approached us with\
  \ the idea to share taxi vans the rest of the way. We found a tall, thin, greying\
  \ man to help us find a ride. He wove us through bustling traffic, across roads,\
  \ our luggage in tow, negotiating prices with each driver. Several screaming matches\
  \ later, we found a taxi and left. 2 hours and 100 dirhams each later, we arrived.\
  \ We dragged our luggage down the windy alleys, the sounds, colors, smells, and\
  \ lights quelling my anxiety by reminding me that we had finally made it to the\
  \ most magical place on earth. \n\nWe decided to spend the first two days of our\
  \ trip on a tour, so the next morning, we boarded a bus bright and early and set\
  \ out to the Zagora Desert. The trip took 8 hours each way, an excruciatingly long\
  \ trip after extensive flights, train rides, and foot travel. We stopped along the\
  \ way, each mountainous locale fit with a merchant eager to sell handmade Berber\
  \ goods to our group. When we finally arrived at our destination, we were met with\
  \ a group of camels adorned as ornately as their male Berber counterparts. The massive\
  \ sand dunes surrounding us were surreal, providing immeasurable beauty and a sense\
  \ of calm to the landscape. Trudging along on our camels, halfway to our camp, I\
  \ developed a nosebleed. Far from graceful, my camel and I continued along the path\
  \ to the camp nonetheless. We unmounted the camels, settled into the camp and made\
  \ our way to the dining tent. \n\nLike walking into a dream, layers of woven rugs,\
  \ fabrics, hanging brass lamps, roaming kittens, and embroidered cushions created\
  \ a mystical ambiance in the tent. In line with Moroccan custom, we were poured\
  \ mint tea from the spout of a brass teapot while we waited for dinner. We were\
  \ served the most aromatic tagines, the cilantro and spices so well blended with\
  \ olives, carrots, and couscous. Before we could finish we heard a stir to our right\
  \ caused by the presence of a scorpion in the tent. Terrified, we witnessed the\
  \ bug being stabbed by one of our hosts, all the more keeping us on guard for another.\
  \ \n\nThe calm settled again and we were escorted outside to the fire, joining the\
  \ Berber men in their traditional songs. One man dressed in cornflower blue head-to-toe\
  \ approached us by firelight and asked if we\u2019d ever seen the stars from the\
  \ desert. \u201CCome find me, you must see them\u201D, he urged. The hand cymbals\
  \ and drum music continued, and we decided to find the man and take him up on his\
  \ offer. He led us 50 feet behind the tents, the sand muffling the music, a taught\
  \ us how Berber men dig themselves under the sand to keep warm. We lay silent under\
  \ the sky. Minutes turned into hours, maybe a lifetime had passed under countless\
  \ shooting stars. The glitter of each one reminding me of my position in the universe,\
  \ lying in the ancient sand of this mystical existence. I looked up at the surreal\
  \ view above me and thought, \u201CI\u2019m finally here\u201D."
