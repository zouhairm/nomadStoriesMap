Text: "I'm black, I'm queer and I'm here. It amazes me how at one point in time black\
  \ Americans needed a travel guide for a road trip across the states to visit grandma\
  \ on a holiday vacation. Moving past the Jim Crow era, those of the LGBT community\
  \ have to do a bit of research before planning a \"gay-cation\" or honeymoon to\
  \ a foreign country to make sure we don't end up as a hashtag. So five stars for\
  \ Portugal! Same-sex legal since 1982! Talk about being a blueprint for gay pride\
  \ parades! Still strongly influenced by Roman Catholicism there is no eliminating\
  \ some public prejudice, however even the boys in cloth can't keep the progression\
  \ of gay liberation from making it's footprint. \n\nSome of the main touristic cities\
  \ of Algarve, Lagos, Albufeira and Tavira are tattooed with gay bars, pubs, nightclubs\
  \ and beaches. Now if you are looking for the wishing well of gaiatos & bambis you\
  \ will want to set your sails for one of the oldest cities on the globe and Portugal's\
  \ capital city of Lisbon. Host of the largest LGBT film festivals in Europe, the\
  \ Lisbon Gay & Lesbian Film Festival should be on the bucket list of any all all\
  \ film enthusiasts. This city is blessed with vibrancy and charisma that blends\
  \ heritage and progression into a vacation gifted from the gods! \n\nSo where does\
  \ a curious soul-searching dyke like myself go for some culture, a little history,\
  \ maybe pick up a hottie and a course some place to try great cocktails? I prefer\
  \ to travel while single so there are some great small group tours and with the\
  \ help of Airbnb Experience there are plenty of locals to tap into hosting a more\
  \ personalized visit to fit your tastes. There is a plethora of hidden gems for\
  \ all ages and all diverse backgrounds. Personally, I would start with the Santa\
  \ Catarina Neighborhood. This area was once a place where free Africans settled\
  \ to create a community. It is highly important for not only African Americans who\
  \ fear traveling abroad but for all of the world to be informed of the historical\
  \ value of African culture all across the globe. Engulfed in the historical energy\
  \ of both LGBT liberation and enslaved African freedom under the sun of such a culturally\
  \ rich land is not only a figment of imagination in a black queer american mind\
  \ but a destination of much needed utopia."
