Text: "\u201CHello! Yes, you, hello!\u201D\nThe elderly Myanmarese man\u2019s face\
  \ peeked out from behind the pockmarked wooden door, his eyes locked on our small\
  \ group. He stepped fully out into the dirt path and waved us over, smiling broadly.\
  \ He was a short man, with long graying hair and faded khaki shorts.\n\u201CCome\
  \ here, inside!\u201D\nThe house was small, all wood and surrounded by a few shrubs\
  \ and a multitude of chickens, all clucking their enthusiasm for new visitors. We\
  \ walked towards the man and entered his house, sparsely furnished and shadowed\
  \ from the setting sun. He motioned us over near the back door and gestured towards\
  \ the floor. At his feet were a pair of sandals, massive footwear that dwarfed my\
  \ size fourteen shoes. I put my flip flop next to them for comparison, and the man\
  \ laughed at the difference.\n\u201COh! Big foot! The lady who owned this house,\
  \ many year ago, these her shoes. Her feet big! This museum now, for her. You Americans\
  \ have big foot too!\u201D\nThe man laughed again, incredibly amused by everything\
  \ that was happening. We assumed he didn\u2019t get a lot of visitors to his museum.\
  \ Tourism was just beginning to flourish in Myanmar again, after nearly forty years\
  \ of discouraging visitors. Now that the military junta was replaced with a civilian\
  \ government, tourists were slowly starting to seep back in, cautiously rediscovering\
  \ a newly risen nation.\n\u201CNow, do you want beer? And peanuts! Yes!\u201D\n\
  The man clapped happily and left the house, trotting down the small hill towards\
  \ the Irrawaddy River. We followed, towards two children running around on the bank,\
  \ throwing sticks and screaming out wild shrieks and whoops. A woman walked down\
  \ from the house behind us, carrying bottles of Myanmar Beer and a small plate of\
  \ hot, toasted peanuts covered in chili flakes. We thanked her for the gifts; she\
  \ bowed her head in response.\n\u201CMy wife, she make peanuts, Myanmar snack, very\
  \ good!\u201D\nHe shoved a handful in his mouth, his teeth and gums stained red\
  \ from chewing paan, a mixture of betel nut leaves and areca nuts. We all tried\
  \ the spicy peanuts, mimicking our hosts handful. We gasped at the heat and immediately\
  \ guzzled down beer to soothe our inflamed mouths. The man laughed again and did\
  \ a happy little jig, as did the children, who now clearly saw us as better entertainment\
  \ than their sticks.\nThe sun was beginning to touch the peaks of the Chin Hills\
  \ in the distance, the light growing weaker but more magical, playful. The old man\
  \ looked towards the sun and spoke quickly to the children, who screamed out approvals\
  \ and sprinted towards the river. \n\u201CWe go in the boat!\u201D\nAnd of course,\
  \ we did.\nOur little wooden craft skimmed across the surface of the Irrawaddy,\
  \ watching the sun fully descend into the hills. His small outboard motor sputtered\
  \ it\u2019s opposition to such a laden vessel. The man\u2019s children sat on his\
  \ lap, helping guide the boat across the river, us four travelers packed in like\
  \ voluntary sardines. We felt the warm breeze on our faces, the cool beer on our\
  \ lips, and the faint sounds of what sounded like a prayer blasting on loudspeakers\
  \ across the small town. We asked the man what it was.\n\u201CBuddhist prayer. We\
  \ have once a year, for all village to hear. Very lucky you are here.\u201D\nThe\
  \ man shuttered the engine, and we drifted quietly with the current, listening to\
  \ the prayer. It was sung in Burmese, a single man\u2019s voice floating calmly\
  \ up and down the scale. The children rested their heads on their father's body,\
  \ their eyelids drooping closed. The seven of us sat in the boat, that same feeling\
  \ of contentment coursing through us alongside the notes of the Buddhist prayer\
  \ and the smell of the river. After a few minutes, the man turned on the motor,\
  \ brought us back to shore, and wished us well. We walked through the dusk, unsure\
  \ if what had just occurred was a dream, a temporary visit to a different world\
  \ where a large footed woman and a generous man with peanuts lived to show weary\
  \ travelers a respite from the wild, wild world."
