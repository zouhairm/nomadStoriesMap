Text: "\"....And here passed my gorgeous twilight under the shadow of endless sky,\
  \ in the lap of the most golden sand of Sam.... Within half an hour after the glorious\
  \ sunset, the mercury fell rapidly enough to make me put my warm coat on.... Now\
  \ sitting and just wandering in my thoughts eager to compose a piece of poetry under\
  \ another lovely moonlight... Will never forget his melody and her beats of kaalbaliya...\"\
  \n \nIt was the month of December. Very spontaneously my fingers typed and posted\
  \ this Facebook status. Whenever I look back, the trip to Jaisalmer always succeeds\
  \ in bringing a sense of pleasure. The impact that a three-day outing had on my\
  \ soul was striking enough. I sat to think and write about 'art'. I was involuntarily\
  \ taken back to Jaisalmer.\n \nMemories from that trip flashed in front of my eyes\
  \ and I zoomed-in for details. I remember that I could sense something out of the\
  \ ordinary as we entered Jaisalmer city, the city in a fort.\n \nIt was around 9\
  \ in the morning. I saw a young girl of twelve or thirteen. She was an 'artist'.\
  \ There was a rope about 8-9 ft above the ground, tied across two distant poles.\
  \ On the rope, she performed barefooted, with three pitchers on her head and metal\
  \ rings in her hands. There was an old man, probably her father, collecting money\
  \ from the appreciators.\n \nArt is the provider for many artists. She could hardly\
  \ acknowledge how talented she was. Maybe the system gave this responsibility to\
  \ us. I saw her constant kohl smudged eyes, indomitable expression of grit. A rare\
  \ but innocent smile graced her pink lips and brunette cheeks.\n \nAs we went through\
  \ the huge entrance gate, there was a feeling of excitement rushing in my head.\
  \ A significant part of Jaisalmer city was settled inside the fort, Sonar Quilla.\
  \ There were small beautiful houses and shops. On the walls of narrow streets, were\
  \ eye-catching paintings, sketches and handicraft jewelries.\n \nThe magnificent\
  \ individual havelis known as Merchant Havelis showcased us the sumptuous work of\
  \ carved yellow sandstones. I was sitting and observing the finest carvings on the\
  \ walls when I overheard a voice from behind. A woman in the window was talking\
  \ on the phone.\n\"My son has gone to study in the city. I wish that we lived in\
  \ a big city.\" she said. In cities, people dream of living in a palace. They were\
  \ living in a palace with dreams of cities. Sometimes ironies are harsh yet beautiful.\n\
  \ \nEven the impressions on the huge golden walls and pillars portrayed ironies.\
  \ All art forms are proficient story-tellers. No matter what way, how old, what\
  \ stage, every piece of art renders its story adeptly.\n \nI was born and brought\
  \ up in Rajasthan which makes me familiar with forts and palaces. Every fort is\
  \ exceptional. Every palace has unique story. And the walls, the carvings undergone\
  \ dilapidation and desolation, still echo those stories, those voices. Those designs\
  \ have talent, patience, sweat and constant deep vision of the sculptor absorbed\
  \ in them. Ravages of so many years are defeated by endeavors of those determined\
  \ hands.\n \n\"Kahte hain kaarigar se kalakaar banne me keval prasansha ka faasla\
  \ hota hai.\" One of us exclaimed critically.  It is the grade of appreciation that\
  \ draws fine line between a sculptor and an artist.\n \nWe were on our way back\
  \ to the hotel. It was 7 PM when I checked my phone for time. It was getting darker.\
  \ I could see stars in the sky already. We reached the main gate of the palace from\
  \ where we had entered in the morning. My eyebrows rose as I saw the young 'artist'\
  \ still dancing on the rope.\n \n\"I just wanna dance among the stars.\" played\
  \ on my iPod."
