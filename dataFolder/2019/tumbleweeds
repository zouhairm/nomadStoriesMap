Text: "There was the \"Welcome to Wyoming\" sign and then, finally, trees, little\
  \ scrubby things crowning a rocky slope along the edge of I-80. After eight hours\
  \ of flat nothingness they might as well have been redwoods. I pulled off at a rest\
  \ stop in Pine Bluffs and parked in the first shade I'd seen since Iowa.\n\nI was\
  \ relieved to have the end of my trip in sight, through I'd been surprised by how\
  \ much I'd liked crossing the Midwest, how beautiful I'd found it. It was like being\
  \ adrift on an ocean of agriculture. I wondered where all that corn would end up,\
  \ what it would be processed into, what kind of pesticides it was covered in. But\
  \ I also took dozens of pictures of the sunflower-framed fields, some blindingly\
  \ white building in the distance, the sky above pale blue and the sun sharpening\
  \ the contrast between each leaf.\n\nMy roommate is out of town when I arrive in\
  \ Laramie, so she leaves my key under a cow skull on the front porch and I have\
  \ to laugh. I didn't actually expect to encounter this sun-bleached old-west icon\
  \  on my first day in town. Next thing you know it'll be cowboys and tumbleweeds.\n\
  \nI meet my roommate a few days later. She's tall and tan and is constantly changing\
  \ in and out of athletic gear. Her name is Tennessee, which sounds as made-up as\
  \ the cow skull, like she's an adventurer out of a book. \n\nI mention how the landscape\
  \ here is so different from the small Pennsylvania town where I grew up. She says\
  \ being out here changes the way you think.\n\n\"There's something about how expansive\
  \ it is--literally, being able to see so much--that really opens your mind.\"\n\n\
  A few days later she gives me a book by an author named, appropriately, Sam Western,\
  \ about the state's history and its mythos about cowboys and rugged independence.\
  \ I read chapters in the morning with my coffee while the constant wind scrapes\
  \ branches against my bedroom window. \n\nWestern makes a compelling argument that\
  \ clinging to strongly to these ideas of old-west self-sufficiency has been bad\
  \ for the state, that they're based in ideas about its history that aren't entirely\
  \ true. The book is short. I finish it in a few days. It leaves me with the sense\
  \ that whatever this place it, it's more complicated than I first imagined.\n\n\
  But whether the myth of the wild untamed west is true or not, it does seem to be\
  \ what draws people here: the indifference of the landscape, how it holds you unflinchingly\
  \ accountable for yourself in a way that no place you've lived before ever has.\
  \ It gives you a certain kind of perspective, one that can only be provided by scale.\
  \ When you have spent too long in the mess of your own life you want a place that\
  \ will make you feel small again, comforted by your own insignificance.\n\nOne day\
  \ in October, two months after I first arrived, I step outside and the whole town\
  \ smells like a campfire. I came out to investigate the honey-colored light coming\
  \ through my blinds at noon, like a sunset six hours early. Everything is sepia-toned\
  \ through a haze over overhead smoke. There are forest fires in Medicine Bow, and\
  \ the smoke has made its way to Laramie, will it will hang like a dry hot fog in\
  \ the air for days.\n\nI stay outside until the back of my throat starts to sting.\
  \ The last time I saw this much smoke was when I was a kid and the neighbors' house\
  \ burned down. I stood outside in my pajamas, barefoot on the wet grass, and watched\
  \ it burn until the fire trucks arrived."
