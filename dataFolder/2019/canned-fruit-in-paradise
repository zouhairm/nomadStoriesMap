Text: "I took advantage of a recent holiday to get out of Havana. I hadn't realized\
  \ how much I needed the mental break, but it was a welcome change to simply sit\
  \ on the beach for a bit. I went to Varadero, which is the largest resort area in\
  \ Cuba. Varadero is a long peninsula, a little over 2 hours east of the capital.\
  \ The drive to Varadero was beautiful, mostly along the coast and over one breathtaking\
  \ ravine. I saw my new favorite propaganda billboard on the way there: a cartoon\
  \ Cuban boy with the words \u201CNunca podr\xE1n bloquear nuestra esperanza,\u201D\
  \ a play on words with the U.S. \"blockade.\" Translation:  \"You will never be\
  \ able to blockade our hope.\"\n\nThe highlight at Varadero is the beach, and there's\
  \ not much else to do there besides enjoy it. The sand is very white and fine. The\
  \ water is teal, you can see right down to your feet on the bottom, and there are\
  \ no waves. There's no way you could surf or body-board or doing anything else.\
  \ The water remains very shallow\u2014less than 5 feet\u2014very far out, at least\
  \ 100 feet from the shore. There are a few people selling hats and dresses and shells\
  \ on the beach, but they stay by the water and don't bother those under their umbrellas.\
  \ Each morning I went out for a walk before it got too hot, and a prop plane spraying\
  \ pesticides was going back and forth along the hotel zone, keeping the mosquitoes\
  \ at bay. \n\nDespite the natural attractions, Varadero is still in Cuba, and this\
  \ is reflected in the quality of the hotels. All the light bulbs were harsh, high-efficiency\
  \ kinds that make you feel like the victim of an alien abduction. Only one of the\
  \ two elevators worked, and it sometimes got confused about what floor it was on.\
  \ The beds were creaky, all the linens and towels were old and thin. But the hotel\
  \ was clean, and that's more important. \n\nAlmost all the hotels in Varadero are\
  \ all-inclusive, as was the one I stayed at. The food was Cuban, which is to say\
  \ cobbled together from whatever was available and of poor quality. The \"salad\
  \ bar\" consisted of some bland tomatoes, bitter lettuce, and a bunch of canned,\
  \ jarred, and preserved items like olives, artichoke hearts, and canned peas and\
  \ carrots. There was even canned fruit on the breakfast bar! Why, in a tropical\
  \ climate, the resort presented canned fruit, is a riddle that only communism can\
  \ answer. All the bread was the same white Wonder Bread-type, just in different\
  \ shapes: croissant-shaped Wonder Bread, loaf-shaped Wonder Bread, roll-shaped Wonder\
  \ Bread, cinnamon bun-shaped Wonder Bread (cinnamon sprinkled on top only, not in\
  \ between layers). Hamburgers were frozen patties, meat dishes were made from strange,\
  \ bad cuts. The highlight was the omelette bar, because they did have eggs and a\
  \ few things to put in there. I loaded up on breakfast and ate little the rest of\
  \ the day.\n\nThe clientele at the resort was an international mix. There were Russians,\
  \ Italians, Germans, Chinese, Spanish, a sprinkling of Latin Americans, but more\
  \ than any other group, Canadians. I know this is likely the first time these words\
  \ have ever been written, but the Canadians were very obnoxious. They were trying\
  \ to get the full value out of the drink portion of the all-inclusive, refilling\
  \ their 40-ounce travel mugs with mojitos or screwdrivers frequently. They blasted\
  \ their own music from travel speakers on the beach or by the pool, hit other beach-goers\
  \ with the footballs and softballs they were tossing around, and spoke English more\
  \ loudly when staff didn't understand them. Basically, they acted like the stereotypical\
  \ ugly Americans. \n\nSome people say that magical realism is real in Cuba. I have\
  \ one example of that from this trip. The first morning at the hotel, I walked out\
  \ of my room, looked out at the empty field between the hotel and the highway, and\
  \ saw two camels. Two camels, just standing there, chewing grass. Who knows how\
  \ or why they were in Varadero, but there they were. Cuba, qu\xE9 pa\xEDs (what\
  \ a country!)."
