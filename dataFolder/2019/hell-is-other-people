Text: "It\u2019s not just history majors or art geeks here. Nor is it just the gamer\
  \ fans who remember climbing on this cathedral while playing Assassin\u2019s Creed.\
  \ (Guilty\u2026)\n\nAn arsenal of selfie sticks wielded by all ages search for the\
  \ perfect angle, while accidentally bursting through each other\u2019s personal\
  \ space bubbles. It\u2019s midday at the famous Florence Cathedral. It\u2019s bloody\
  \ hot, and a bit chaotic.\n\nOpposite the cathedral is a really pretty door that\
  \ I know nothing about, but people seem desperate to get a photo of. One peaceful\
  \ looking couple in their fifties stood a fraction too long in front of it, unaware\
  \ they were spoiling the shot for grumpy old Uncle Borris, a toad of a man who spent\
  \ way too much on his DSLR to have the view blocked by anyone.\n\n\u201CEy move!\
  \ Shooo!\u201D\n\nThis cranky old bastard literally shooed them away. I couldn\u2019\
  t believe it. He skipped \u2018excuse me could you please move\u2019 and went straight\
  \ into fuck-off mode. Though visibly startled by his rudeness, the couple graciously\
  \ moved on.\n\n\u201CHell is other people.\u201D\n\nRecently I\u2019ve seen some\
  \ of the most famous tourist attractions in the world like the Colosseum, the Vatican\
  \ Museums, and the Mona Lisa in the Louvre. Whether they\u2019ve exceeded or fallen\
  \ short of my expectations, the only certain thing is I wasn\u2019t the only one\
  \ who wanted to find out for themselves.\n\nThe instagram photoshoots. The guided\
  \ tours. The lines. The catch-22 of 10,000 people wanting to see a beautiful, serene\
  \ place at the same time. Lastly, the complaints. Usually from fellow travelers\
  \ back at HQ\u2026\n\n\u201COh it was too \u2018touristy\u2019.\u201D\n\nI can\u2019\
  t stand this. When people complain about world famous, historically significant\
  \ attractions being busy, it makes my corpse roll over in my grave and I\u2019m\
  \ not even dead yet. I\u2019m talking irritated on some Hodor/Back to the Future\
  \ level. I try explaining politely that they\u2019re embodying their own problem.\n\
  \nIt\u2019s the same people that complain there are too many sausages at the fest,\
  \ while they themselves have a cheerio. Or the people who sit in traffic at peak\
  \ time complaining of the cars in front of them, oblivious to the fact that they\
  \ are the traffic to everyone behind them.\n\nIn between tagging up gift shops,\
  \ Banksy said it better than I ever could:\n\n\u201CThere are no exceptions to the\
  \ rule that everyone thinks they\u2019re an exception to the rules.\u201D\n\nI\u2019\
  ll happily admit I\u2019m a selfie stick wielding, popular attraction attending\
  \ antichrist. I usually do my best to be considerate, while inevitably accidentally\
  \ existing in front of someone. Since I know what I am, I don\u2019t get mad or\
  \ look down on people who go to touristy places. It\u2019s not a bad thing.\n\n\
  It\u2019s OK to enjoy a place other people also enjoy.\n\nYes people can be rude\
  \ and inconsiderate. Yes with higher concentrations of people these places can become\
  \ hectic and it can be hard to move around. Often I\u2019ll have to dodge people\
  \ who just stop in front of me to take photos. It becomes a maze. But I also recall\
  \ stopping to take a photo without thinking, causing someone else to play the maze\
  \ game behind me.\n\nHarden up travelers, you are in these exotic places doing what\
  \ millions, if not billions of people would want to be doing right now, yet you\
  \ complain and excavate negativity because unfortunately other people are alive\
  \ and are living just as vivid a life as yours.\n\nA very famous French philosopher\
  \ Jean-Paul-Sartre once said \u201CHell is other people.\u201D\n\nMaybe he meant\
  \ that without an exterior opinion, your life would be exactly the way you want\
  \ it to be. Or that all hurt in the world is caused by humans.\nOr maybe someone\
  \ just blocked his view of the pretty door."
