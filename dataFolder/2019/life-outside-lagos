Text: "Schooling in the South East part of my country was something I never envisioned\
  \ not to think about spending more than 3 years for college!\n\nThat was how after\
  \ secondary school I wrote JAMB'an entry examination written in my country to gain\
  \ admission in the high institution'. My first choice was UNILAG which is suited\
  \ in the locality I lived while my second choice was ABSU 'had to choice it to because\
  \ I couldn't leave that spot vacant'\nThe exam was successfully for both universities\
  \ and I was awaiting admission when my name came out it was not the all dream UNILAG\
  \ but ABSU\U0001F926\u200D\u2640\uFE0F\U0001F625 do you know what made it worse?\n\
  \nUggh I wasn't given Accounting! Gosh what am I to study in a state university\
  \ then\U0001F926\u200D\u2640\uFE0F\U0001F625 when I checked the course I was Education\
  \ Business Studies.. Jesss how will I study this course, What will I tell people\
  \ am studying? What will be career be? O God 4 years!!!!\U0001F926\u200D\u2640\uFE0F\
  \U0001F625\U0001F926\u200D\u2640\uFE0F\U0001F625\U0001F926\u200D\u2640\uFE0F\U0001F625\
  \n\n\nThat was how my journey from Lagos to Abia State started it was an eventful\
  \ journey from registration, hostel accommodation, to attending classes with people\
  \ from different culture, tribe, upbringing, attitude most of which was very different\
  \ from all my experience in life some where speaking their native language instead\
  \ of the English Language \U0001F926\u200D\u2640\uFE0F.\n\nI was just jejely taking\
  \ each day as it comes whilst seeking admission from other schools from good location,\
  \ but I came in contact with the local/village suited school one thing I was blessed\
  \ with was intelligent roommates who made me see other things that might be interesting\
  \ like the communities the cheap expensive culture.\n\nHowever, it turned out life\
  \ in ABSU was actually what I was suppose to experience with no hassles of traffic\
  \ and juggles of working class people but a life of meditation on the other cycle\
  \ of the way other people lived and survived, a place you have to remind yourself\
  \ of your existence and that you could do better no matter the environment you find\
  \ yourself.."
