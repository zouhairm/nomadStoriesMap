Text: "\u2018This should be an easy boat ride\u2019 I think to myself while I watch\
  \ our belongings being loaded into the light-blue fishing boat. It\u2019s not a\
  \ large boat but is commonly seen on the Caribbean Sea; long and narrow with the\
  \ bow of the boat widening before coming to a narrow tip. A couple of hard benches\
  \ sit farther back in the boat and clearly are not meant for comfort or long rides.\
  \ Our captain has dark skin and is heavier set wearing baggy clothes and a pair\
  \ of black sunglasses he never seems to take off despite the overcast sky. He sits\
  \ behind the passenger benches on a ledge at the back of the boat where he operates\
  \ a manual tiller engine. He sits back quietly and emotionless. In addition to the\
  \ captain and co-captain there are 4 passengers and I couldn't imagine fitting anything\
  \ else on the boat. As I wait to leave Puerto Barrios I gaze upon the open sea willing\
  \ myself to see Belize in the distance but can\u2019t. My small backpack lays at\
  \ my feet as we pull away; the wind against my skin and the smell of the sea fills\
  \ my nostrils.\n-\nRain starts to lightly splatter on my skin and I look around\
  \ with growing concern as the conversation ceases. The water is changing; the waves\
  \ are growing in size as we all grip the seats for some added security. I look back\
  \ to see the cool, emotionless face of the captain, still wearing his sunglasses.\
  \ Beyond him I can no longer see the land from which we came. Don\u2019t freak out.\
  \ No need to be worried - he knows what he\u2019s doing. None of us had passed through\
  \ Amatique Bay before besides the captain (we hoped), and so we didn\u2019t know\
  \ what to expect. The boat is rocking us violently now, throwing us in different\
  \ directions. My knuckles turn white grasping the bench and the short sidewall of\
  \ the boat. \u2018Is it me, or do those waves look awfully big?\u2019 I think to\
  \ myself. As we leave the top of a wave we are suspended in the air for a brief\
  \ moment. I can hear the high-pitched revving of the engine as it no longer has\
  \ water to resist against. \u2018Oh my god, we are legit suspended in the air right\
  \ now\u2019 I marvel to myself. As quickly as we had left the water, we come into\
  \ hard contact with it, the impact jarring my spine. Instinctively I spread my legs\
  \ out wide where I sit, providing more stability so that I\u2019m not thrown off\
  \ the boat. As we go soaring off another wave, engine revving something fierce,\
  \ I come to accept the fact that I may die in this sea. In this moment of clarity\
  \ and acceptance, I lift one foot from the bottom of the boat and search for my\
  \ small back pack holding everything of importance to me. Once I find it I fish\
  \ my foot through the strap and wrap it around once so that it won\u2019t fly away\
  \ should we face the worst case scenario. I give myself a mental pat on the back\
  \ knowing that everything in it is safe and waterproofed. We soar off another wave,\
  \ this time it must be 20\u2019 in height. When we come back down from our moment\
  \ of suspension the landing is loud and disorientating, jarring my whole body and\
  \ throwing me from where I sit despite my strong hold. Gazing forward at the waves\
  \ to come, I realize there will be no respite.\n-\nThree hours later, heart racing\
  \ and body numb with adrenaline, I see land in the distance. As we approach our\
  \ destination the waves calm and everyone on the boat has started to chat again.\
  \ None of us seem to talk about the terrifying experience we all lived through.\
  \ I\u2019m exhausted and hungry, yet elated that I survived a near death experience.\
  \ As we shuffle down a line passing us through security, I smile to myself as I\
  \ think back on the recent events. I turn to look at the boat and see the captain,\
  \ sitting relaxed and expressionless, with his sunglasses on."
