Text: "Heat seared my chest. Sweat pooled in my underarms. I squinted under the harsh\
  \ midday sun, but I couldn\u2019t see Shepherds\u2019 Field anywhere. The road underfoot\
  \ curved to the left, just as my map showed, but only homes the color of parched\
  \ earth glinted back. I took a long slug from my water bottle, welcoming the liquid\
  \ like a desert welcomes rain. Then I stuffed the bottle back into my pack. Perhaps\
  \ I wasn\u2019t meant to find this Palestinian site after all. \n\nI considered\
  \ my options, not wanting to search in vain for some old field, but also reluctant\
  \ to trudge up the hill I had just ambled down and rejoin the throngs of people\
  \ circulating between Bethlehem\u2019s tombs, grottos and churches. More a lover\
  \ of history than a worshipper of Christ, I had no idea prior to visiting the Holy\
  \ Land just how out of place I would feel at such religious landmarks. Witnessing\
  \ believers prostrating themselves on sacred stones, or reciting the Lord\u2019\
  s Prayer en masse, made me long for a spiritual experience that I could understand.\
  \ \n\nYet my slice of heaven eluded me, and as I debated my next move, a woman in\
  \ a niqab approached. Slightly more revealing than a burka, her garb still permitted\
  \ me to see only her eyes. \n\nI felt exposed, as if I had been caught stepping\
  \ out of the shower. My ankle-length leggings felt like shorts, and the loose t-shirt\
  \ that fell below my waist felt like a bikini top.\n\n\"Hello,\" she said.\n\n\u201C\
  Marhaban,\u201D I responded, using the one Arabic word I knew but unable to hide\
  \ my American accent.\n\nI couldn\u2019t see her lips curve upwards, but her date-colored\
  \ eyes exuded a smile. \u201CYou need help?\u201D \n\nI toed the pavement, wondering\
  \ why my surveyor father had passed down his peripatetic proclivities but not his\
  \ natural sense of direction. \u201CWell, I\u2019m trying to find Shepherds\u2019\
  \ Field.\u201D \n\n\u201COkay.\u201D Her eyes betrayed another grin. \u201CI tell\
  \ you. But first, you come for tea.\u201D She pointed to an indiscriminate tan building\
  \ on her right. \n\n\u201COh, thank you, but\u2014\u201D \n\n\u201CBut nothing.\
  \ Come.\u201D \n\nAlready feeling disrespectful\u2014for my clothing, my attitude\
  \ about religious customs, and my thoughts on religion in general\u2014I followed\
  \ her inside.  \n\nOnce she closed the door, she removed her niqab. Flamingo-pink\
  \ pants brightened the sparse living room, and hair the shade of a faded penny accentuated\
  \ the olive face below it. \n\n\u201CPlease,\u201D she said, gesturing to a chair\
  \ at the dining room table. \u201CSit.\u201D \n\nI did as asked, and she flitted\
  \ into the kitchen. \n\nWhen she returned, she brought with her a basket of warm\
  \ pita bread, a bowl of butter, and three more bowls of hummus, tzatziki, and strawberry\
  \ jam. Hardboiled eggs followed, and then came slices of meat and cubes of feta.\
  \ Then olives, tomatoes, halva, and Turkish delight. It was a feast appropriate\
  \ for royalty\u2014or at least, I thought, someone who shared her religious views.\
  \ \n\nYet she never asked about my beliefs or brought up her own. Instead, she asked\
  \ where I grew up and what countries I had visited. She asked about my family and\
  \ told me about hers. She asked if I had seen the wall that Israel built between\
  \ 1994 and 2014 to keep Palestinians away from their rightful land, and she expressed\
  \ her sadness at feeling like a refugee in her own nation.\n\nAs we talked, we ate.\
  \ Whenever I managed to clear my plate, she covered it again with cheese or tomatoes\
  \ or pita.  \n\n\u201CBreaking bread,\u201D she said at one point, \u201Cis the\
  \ best way to find common ground. Through food we talk, we listen, and we learn.\u201D\
  \n\nI nodded, knowing what she meant, but not knowing what to say. I had felt cut\
  \ off for the past week\u2014from a people, a culture, and a land\u2014but only\
  \ because I was unwilling to seek common ground.\n\n\u201CPeople are different,\u201D\
  \ she said, \u201Cbut shutting them out doesn\u2019t get anyone anywhere.\u201D\
  \ \n\nWe talked for another hour, and at last she brought out the tea. As I sipped\
  \ it, I realized I didn\u2019t need to locate Shepherds\u2019 Field after all; the\
  \ spiritual experience I had been seeking was right here, in an ordinary house,\
  \ with an extraordinary host."
