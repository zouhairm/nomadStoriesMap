Text: "Three years ago, I lied to the world. This is my chance to tell the truth.\
  \ The following is true. \n\nI loved to run. Sometimes I would go for a quick jog\
  \ and then accidentally run for up to six hours. I called doing it a \u201CForrest\
  \ Gump\u201D. So, at 23 years old, I decided to go for a really long run. \n\nIn\
  \ 2017 I became the first person to run across Zimbabwe. It was a total of 724 km\
  \ and it took me 17 days. I ran for mental health. For the misunderstood schizophrenics,\
  \ sufferers of bipolar disorder, anxiety and depression in Zimbabwe. For all the\
  \ \u201Ccrazy\u201D people like me.\n\nI figured out that to get to Victoria Falls\
  \ in two weeks, I would have to run on average 51.7 km a day. It was in Kadoma that\
  \ things went wrong. I spent the evening with friends. \u201CWhat if you run into\
  \ a lion\u201D? I told them I had a taser. They laughed. \u201CBy the time you get\
  \ close enough to taser them you\u2019ll be dead chum! Use this. Pepper spray\u201D\
  . \n\nThe next day I made it to Kwekwe. At 64 km it was my longest run yet. The\
  \ next day we were heading into Silobela, the most remote and dangerous part of\
  \ the run. \n\nI am running out of words, but I want to tell my story. In short,\
  \ during a remote part of the run, I was attacked by two men. They raped me and\
  \ tried to kill me. I used the pepper spray on them, but they rubbed it out of their\
  \ eyes and came back. Again and again. They had dragged me off the road into the\
  \ bush. I could see the road, less than half a metre away, but through such thick\
  \ thorn bushes a passer-by would never see me. Raped and dead in the bush. Everyone\
  \ was right, I thought. This was it. \n\nThere was noone to answer my cries for\
  \ help. Noone to hear my screams. I heard a car and felt such relief. The men went\
  \ to run, I tried to stop them. The car didn\xB4t stop. I have never felt such terror.\
  \ Now they would definitely kill me. \n\nThen Mayuni came back. It was really him.\
  \ They ran away. The rest of the day was a blur. Police station, statement. In the\
  \ hospital they gave me injections, the morning after pill and a course of ARVs\
  \ in case the men had HIV/AIDS. \n\nThat night, I went back to Kwekwe. I told my\
  \ friends and family I had lost my phone and that is why I had returned. Someone\
  \ saw the scratches on my back. I lied and said I had been mugged. The next day,\
  \ I carried on the run. I ran over a marathon every day. One day I received a call\
  \ from the police officer. They had found the men. They needed me to identify them.\
  \ It was them. The police had found my earphones and empty taser cannister in the\
  \ thorn bushes by the road. \n\nDuring the trial, I sat outside. They were accused\
  \ of rape and attempted murder. They pleaded guilty. They were sentenced to over\
  \ 20 years each. I didn\xB4t want them to go to prison. I pleaded with the judge.\
  \ The police officer told me they were brothers. That they came from a poor family.\
  \ That in prison, there was a library. They could educate themselves and get better\
  \ opportunities. I think about them nearly every day. I hope they are okay. \n\n\
  I finished the run. I lied about why I went back to Kwekwe. I didn\xB4t tell anyone\
  \ about going to Gweru for the trial. But I didn\xB4t lie about how far I ran, we\
  \ calculated every kilometre. Mayuni promised we wouldn\xB4t miss a single one.\
  \ \n\nI made it to Victoria Falls. Getting attacked by those men was both the worst\
  \ and best thing that has ever happened to me. I am stronger. Less foolhardy. More\
  \ spiritual. \n\nI want to share my story in case it helps any girl or boy, man\
  \ or woman who has been abused, attacked or raped. It will be okay. It will get\
  \ better. It\u2019s not your fault."
