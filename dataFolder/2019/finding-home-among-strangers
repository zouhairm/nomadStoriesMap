Text: "It was mid evening, on a week day and the streets of Cusco, Peru were bustling.\
  \ \nThere were mundanely beautiful moments all around me. \nArtisans sat on street\
  \ curbs, weaving beads, creating dolls or widdling away at small crafts. \nA young\
  \ boy got his shoes shined on a park bench at a roadside bus stop. \nYoung women\
  \ in beautiful Spanish garments laughed and whispered as tourists admired their\
  \ outfits.\nA young mother passed by, her daughter\u2019s big brown eyes peaking\
  \ from over top her vibrant blanket. \nI stopped and asked if I may take their picture\
  \ and the mother seemed surprised and touched. \nIt didn\u2019t matter where I looked,\
  \ life was happening all around me.\nAs the evening air got cooler, a father tucked\
  \ his son into his jacket and fastened the zipper. \nAn old miner pushed through\
  \ the crowd to board his bus home, still covered from the day\u2019s dust. \nA young\
  \ pauper watched the sunset as his elderly care giver held out a hat for change\
  \ from passersby. \nCrossing guards blew whistles and held signs, wearing large\
  \ over-sized masks. \nA young couple curled up on the bench nearby, unaware that\
  \ they had an audience, shared whispers and kisses under the fading light. \nIt\
  \ was my birthday, and I felt a little alone, and a little sad. \nThe day had passed\
  \ and although it was full of excitement, it just hadn\u2019t felt like my birthday.\
  \ \nI was sick, tired, a little homesick, and no one knew it was my birthday, I\
  \ was just another face on the street, in a sea of faces. \nWhen we sat down to\
  \ dinner in a second story restaurant in Central Cusco, we were served a broth soup\
  \ with shaved zucchini and carrots. \nI slurped it up as fast as I could. It was\
  \ the best chicken soup I had ever had. \nOur main course was quinoa breaded chicken\
  \ fillets with fries.\nDid they know how much this Canadian girl loved chicken fingers?\
  \   \nAs the tables were being cleared, one of my table companions had asked to\
  \ see my camera.\nNo sooner had I handed over my camera, all the lights went out.\
  \ \nI felt a panic wash over me, knowing I was without my camera to capture what\
  \ was about to happen. \nLittle did I know the photography and more, was all being\
  \ taken care of. \nA Peruvian pan flute band broke out into a song, and a giant\
  \ cake with glowing candles emerged from the kitchen.\nThe band played an instrumental\
  \ version of Happy Birthday, while the cake was laid before me.\nIt was the longest\
  \ version of Happy Birthday I had ever heard.\nI was smiling ear to ear. \nOur guide,\
  \ Lucho, gave me a kiss on the cheek and wished me a happy birthday, as the restaurant\
  \ staff threw their silver platters on the floor as a gesture of good luck for my\
  \ next 365 days.\nWhen I blew out the candles, the band broke out into Richie Valen\u2019\
  s La Bamba.\nI could have been glowing. \nI was so grateful for the kindness of\
  \ Lucho, for the talent of the performers and for the blessings from the staff.\
  \ \nIt was my 25th birthday, I was travelling alone in Peru, and I was aglow with\
  \ love from total strangers. \nI had no idea I would find home in a restaurant full\
  \ of strangers in Cusco, but I felt surrounded by love. \nTravellers may find home\
  \ in a place, but I cherish the people that unlock the feeling of home in my heart."
