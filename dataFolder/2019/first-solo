Text: "Hanoi. I will never forget that word, that city. It holds a significance for\
  \ me, as I went to Vietnam's capital city for my first solo trip. A symbol of decision\
  \ of courage and dream realized. A previous combination of family trips, with friends,\
  \ and a-bit-of-fear had hold that winning occasion - but I finally made it happen\
  \ & felt like a champion!\n\nI spent days studying the city map. Since I couldn\u2019\
  t ride motorbike nor bicycle \u2013 what a bummer I know \u2013 I need to be strategic\
  \ with my walk-around-the-town plan with only limited time in hands. So to be more\
  \ efficient, I did my own clusterings with Hoan Kiem Lake as the centre point of\
  \ everything.\n\nSo off I went to an adventure of a lifetime, backpacking style!\
  \ Hostel & tour to Halong Bay had been booked - with some adrenaline last min arrangements!\n\
  \nAfter arriving, I went straight to find the express bus going to the main district\
  \ where the backpackers stay. Relying on my research plus the conductor :), I got\
  \ off on what-should-be-the-right-spot and started walking. I didn\u2019t buy the\
  \ Sim Card at the airport prior thinking to just do it in town. So I was ready to\
  \ look for my hostel with just a screenshot that I took. To my surprise, when I\
  \ started walking, the blue dot on my offline map downloaded from an app moved too\
  \ \u2013 it was me! This not-so-tech-savvy gal just made an important discovery,\
  \ whoahh I rejoiced !!\n\nI found my hostel, went to money changer to get enough\
  \ VND to pay for my Halong Bay tour, then settled down a bit. Made a small talk\
  \ with a friendly-looking traveller, she told me about Sapa that I thought to go\
  \ before that it was very cold, 3 degree Celcius. Luckily I decided not to go, didn\u2019\
  t think I was ready to cope with that at that point.\n\nI spent the rest of the\
  \ day visited my cluster no 3, basically a traditional house, a temple & Dong Xuan\
  \ traditional market, then took a nice pho dinner across my hostel \u2013 dragging\
  \ the reception gal to help me translate lol. Every Sunday night turned out to be\
  \ a car-free day around the lake \u2013 didn\u2019t know about it! Beautiful performances\
  \ by street musicians and artists, was crowded by families, it was a nice atmosphere\
  \ and definitely a nice surprise.\n\nI walked further to visit Hanoi Opera House\
  \ and went off the beaten path to discover the less-known National Drama Theatre\
  \ just behind it. Rested a bit, I sat down by the road \u2013 like the locals \u2013\
  \ enjoying some dessert. On my way back, \u2018accidentally\u2019 passed St Joseph\
  \ Cathedral, got curious about a street food & gave it a try. Then home sweet home!\n\
  \nThe very next morning I got picked up for my Halong Bay 2D1N tour, where we would\
  \ spend a night on the boat. Truly another surprise to find there was another Vietnamnese\
  \ girl so we shared room, saved additional USD 20-30 if we had to go with a private\
  \ one. It was quite a fun adventure going around the islands, visited the famous\
  \ cave and took 400 steep steps going up to the top of Titop island!\n\nBack to\
  \ the city! I decided to watch the famous water puppet theatre show and had a dinner\
  \ around that area. Slept in early for another packed itinerary on my last full\
  \ day in Hanoi.\n\nTime for a full gear! Spent whole day from morning to dawn visiting\
  \ those important historical places: Ho Chi Minh Presidential Palace-Mausoleum-Museum\
  \ \u2013 he is the founder of the city, so it was imperative! Then Imperical Citadel\
  \ (a Unesco heritage site) and some others, appeared in 2-3 spots just to take pic\
  \ and mark checked! But finally didn\u2019t have enough time for the Women\u2019\
  s Museum \u2013 which something I really wanted to visit from day one, but this\
  \ is what a procrastination would bring you!\n\nFinally my last day! On my way to\
  \ airport, I still felt like I was in a dream, full of sweet surprises & discoveries\
  \ - yet I couldn\u2019t stop this smile on my face knowing I made it come true!"
