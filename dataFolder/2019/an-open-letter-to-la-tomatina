Text: "Dear La Tomatina,\n\nI knew you years before we had even met. The craziest\
  \ thing is that I was never interested yet, I took a chance on you.\n\nYou were\
  \ half a world away in Bunol, Spain but in 2018 fate brought us together.\n\nI put\
  \ a lot of effort preparing for our first date, little did I realise no amount of\
  \ preparation would help, but I am getting ahead of myself here\u2026\n\nThe day\
  \ I had been both looking forward to and dreading had arrived.  \n\nThe hour or\
  \ so drive to Bunol felt like the longest bus ride of my life..\n\nI had a basic\
  \ understanding of what you looked like at your peak but I had never seen the rows\
  \ on rows of buses, an entire town barricaded up as though we we living through\
  \ a zombie apocalypse and the large amount of sangria consumption before entering\
  \ the arena. \n\nAs I walked further into your labyrinth, I remained nervous yet\
  \ with a hint of optimism. Look, La Tomatina, I did want to like you. Honestly,\
  \ for a little while I did.\n\nYou surprised me with a water fight\u2026 well, not\
  \ so much of a fight and more a refreshing crowd-wide shower if you will. \n\nI\
  \ managed to temporarily escape the splash zone to check out one of your famous\
  \ features, the ham climb. I do give it to you La Tomatina, you sure know how to\
  \ put together an \u2018interesting\u2019 date.\n\nA bundle of competitive souls\
  \ all pouring over each other as they made it up the lard covered, lonely pole,\
  \ with one goal; to grab the holy ham that taunted them from the top. \n\nAnother\
  \ year had gone by with no one stealing your ham and I was somewhat relived. It\
  \ meant the moment that was giving the the most anxiety was postponed as the tomato\
  \ throwing does not commence early unless the ham is claimed. \n\nYou could feel\
  \ the tsunami of adrenaline roll in with the trucks. It was claustrophobically busy\
  \ in the streets already but when those giant, tomato filled monsters barged through,\
  \ we all had to go into survival mode.\n\nMy giant goggles were ferociously fogged,\
  \ not that I would have seen anything beyond the guy\u2019s back in front of me\
  \ but I refused to take them off due to the suffocating smell of rotten tomatoes.\n\
  \nThings between us started heating up with tomatoes flying from every angle. I\
  \ couldn\u2019t defend myself as my hands were locked against my body. The only\
  \ part of me exposed was my head, an open target.\n\nYou could see I was getting\
  \ flustered but things kept getting more and more intense. \n\nI had reached my\
  \ breaking point. I had poured my heart out to you and it was thrown straight back\
  \ into my face along with another tomato.\n\nMy heart was pumping faster than it\
  \ ever had before but then a miracle happened\u2026\n\nSome people have really great\
  \ friends that will call, faking an emergency, to get you away from a bad date,\
  \ however, I had this complete stranger use himself as a human shield to usher me\
  \ out of the war zone.\n\nI finally peeled the goggles off my face and for the first\
  \ time I could actually see the waterfall of tomatoes. Even though I was looking\
  \ down things started to look up from here.\n\nThe worst of our date was over and\
  \ within a couple of minutes I had come back to life again thanks to a few hose\
  \ offs and dance parties with the locals. My only problem now was that I had no\
  \ idea where I was.\n\nI have no idea how long I was lost in your complex web for\
  \ but it seemed the universe had decided to push me in the exit just in time.\n\n\
  I said goodbye to my pungent, tomato stained clothes and you\u2026\n\nI\u2019m sorry,\
  \ La Tomatina, we\u2019re breaking up.\n\nIt\u2019s not you, It\u2019s me.\n\nI\
  \ do wish you the best and I am sure someone will fall in love with you, if they\
  \ haven\u2019t already. Who knows, this might be someones dream date!\n\nYours truly,\n\
  -the one who got away"
