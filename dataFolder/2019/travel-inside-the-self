Text: 'Once I traveled to a country they call the country of water, greenery and good
  face, and they also said it is a country of magic and beauty,From the very first
  moment that I put my feet in it, I was driven by longing and hope and fear and confusion.

  Its small alleyways and ancient cities were not made up of stone buildings, rocks,
  wood, monuments, mosques and temples, but also people who dug many monuments and
  monuments on their faces.In my first encounter with an older Moroccan, my real journey
  began in this country but it was not through cities, countryside, seas, rivers and
  plains. It was a journey through myself and between me and many interesting human
  figures.

  I knew a court guard as an old man, but he taught me that traveling was a story
  I had to tell myself, and he taught me that traveling would be fun only by forming
  friends, lovers and loved ones.

  He taught me that travel is knowledge added to the heart before the mind and added
  to the soul before the body ... The movement between the mosque and the church and
  the Jewish temple was the greatest witness that the human soul and human beings
  are very rich and diverse and can live and coexist and grow in any environment and
  within any field.

  I knew that my journey to Morocco was not only among the beauties of women, but
  between the delusions of soul, spirit, love, love, and humiliation'
