Text: "After teaching high school for over a decade in America, the job was leaving\
  \ me  burnt out. I would jokingly tell my students that if a certain presidential\
  \ candidate was elected, I would definitely move out of the country. I was completely\
  \ shocked when I learned he had won. This started my search for  potential prospects\
  \ abroad. My daughter was already settled in Indonesia so I decided I would give\
  \ it a chance. An added bonus would be that I could visit my grandson while I am\
  \ there. I didn't know what to expect and honestly it was a bit daunting.  I knew\
  \ it was a Muslim country with very strict social rules.  Being a divorced foreigner\
  \ going to a country were women are  considered second class citizens wasn't especially\
  \ appealing to me. I imagined the locals would be critical of my life choices and\
  \ beliefs. On top of that, I didn't know the language. Still, I was determined to\
  \ go so I began searching for teaching jobs that were close to my daughter's town.\
  \ Meanwhile, I prepared myself by taking a summer TESOL course to get certified\
  \ in teaching English. \n     It took months before I finally found one job located\
  \ in a city near my daughter. To my surprise, my age became an issue for employment\
  \ there. I discovered that employers frown upon hiring people over 50 years old.\
  \ Exception is given to those whose expertise is needed by a company.  Fortunately\
  \ for me, the manager referred me to a different school which needed a foreign science\
  \ teacher with experience. Miracles do happen! I took a vacation to visit my daughter\
  \ and while I was there I scheduled an interview with my potential employer.  Although\
  \ living in Indonesia is quite cheap, I wanted to earn enough money to travel back\
  \ and forth to the U.S. whenever I wanted. I knew I would be making significantly\
  \ less money than I earned in the U.S. , but it was all relative to the cost of\
  \ living. The employer assured me that I would definitely make enough to save money\
  \ to travel. The only thing left was to make the commitment to stay in Indonesia\
  \ for at least 18 months. This was a big leap for me. The only traveling I had done\
  \ so far was the occasional trip to Florida  and Puerto Rico. Now I was planning\
  \ to go half way around the world to a different time zone far away from my family\
  \ in the States. I had to process it in my head for a couple of months before finally\
  \ accepting their offer. I sold off all of my possessions, left my old jobs, and\
  \ applied for my visa before I was on my way to a new life. \n      I haven't looked\
  \ back since. Indonesia has turned out to be a beautiful country with very friendly\
  \ people. It's such a big difference from the rushed pace of America. Here the pace\
  \ is much slower which might be frustrating at times but allows me to enjoy the\
  \ simpler things in life like the beautiful surroundings and the interesting people.\
  \ Everyday, I am impressed by my students who learn to speak three languages at\
  \ a very young age. \"Don't worry, Miss\", they would say when I stressed over tardiness,\
  \ \"It's ok\". Life here has been a relief for me. I felt the years of stress melt\
  \ away. I now have time to think about eating healthy and enjoying my new surroundings.\
  \ An added bonus I found was that medical costs here are much lower than in America.\
  \ Moving here has also opened up more travel opportunities for me to see other nearby\
  \ countries like Malaysia and Singapore at exceptionally cheaper rates than traveling\
  \ in the West.   Being here I have learned to empathize with immigrants as I have\
  \ become one myself. I have experienced how tough it is to make your way around\
  \ a country not knowing the language and unable to communicate your needs. Thankfully,\
  \ technology is making it easier to travel with the many translation tools available\
  \ online. If you are thinking of traveling, take my advice and do it. Even at a\
  \ \"mature\" age, it can change your life."
