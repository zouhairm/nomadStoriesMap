Text: "Within a six month period I have moved from Manchester City, England with over\
  \ half a million people to 95km South of Alice Springs, Australia where the population\
  \ would maybe hit 20\u2026.  (There\u2019s a camel farm and roadhouse 5km down the\
  \ road so that bumps it up).\n\nTo say I have done a complete backflip is an understatement\u2026\
  .\n\nRight now, writing this, I am sitting on the veranda of an old house on top\
  \ of a small hill. \nThe floor boards are made out of that brownish green wood that\
  \ has long divots in each board- you know the ones that make a vroom sound if you\
  \ run your flip flop in the opposite direction to them? \nThe roof is just basic\
  \ steel with a few outdoor lights, there\u2019s an outdoor swing chair with one\
  \ of those sun covers here too- but it looks like it\u2019s been a few years since\
  \ that was used...\nI am sitting on a plain wooden bench that is jammed up against\
  \ the wall with my laptop resting gently on my thighs. It isn\u2019t the most comfortable\
  \ position in the world, but it\u2019s keeping me on task.\n\nThe view is like nothing\
  \ I have ever experienced! We both moved here thinking it would be dry and flat\u2026\
  \ We were wrong. There has been over 80mm of rain on the property since we arrived!\
  \ \nThe place is beaming green and as I look out from my spot on the veranda I see\
  \ a mixture of red dirt, clumped grass and trees that stand about 20m tall- not\
  \ really gum trees but those scrubby bushy kind of trees that don\u2019t have any\
  \ branches or leaves until almost halfway up. Each one stands alone, as though every\
  \ tree for itself. \nThe tree trunks are black in colour, not brown- they remind\
  \ me of the ones from Nan\u2019s garden out the back.\n\nI can see the feed lot-\
  \ but only just. A few pens, but they\u2019re empty. A triple of cattle went to\
  \ Charters Towers this morning\u2026 \n\nThen I look out, past the immediate objects\
  \ and into the distance. I see the ridges, but they call them mountains, covered\
  \ in patchy bushes (or at least that is what they look like from here) and they\
  \ stretch as far as I can see across the horizon. \nThe terrain reminds me of something\
  \ from an American postcard of the desert: rocky, red, mountainous terrain, but\
  \ flat in between. The sky stretches for what seems like an eternity; everywhere\
  \ I look I can see blue for miles.\n\nIt is currently 36 degrees (Celsius) with\
  \ 40% humidity, my legs are running with sweat and I am sitting in the shade.\n\n\
  I can hear the birds in the trees whistling away, but they\u2019re not close, just\
  \ within earshot. I have actually started whistling myself- usually when I am walking\
  \ to and from the main house. I am not sure why and it definitely wasn\u2019t on\
  \ purpose, but it just seems fitting for the situation. I often find myself unconsciously\
  \ doing it as I go about my work.\n\nThere\u2019s a soft humming of the cicadas\
  \ and the growl of the generator as it fuels our electricity. A slight breeze that\
  \ adds to the sounds of nature going about its day- it brings a much welcomed coolness\
  \ after sitting outside in the warmth.\n\nIt is a beautiful spot and as I am sure\
  \ you can imagine; very peaceful.\n\nUntil the fucking flies find you and completely\
  \ ruin it all! I have literally been sitting here for 15 minutes and would do it\
  \ more often, but I am fed up with the bastards already. And if you try to stick\
  \ it out, you know; be bigger than the bugs, hold your ground- show them who is\
  \ boss\u2026 You will sorely find they invite they\u2019re mates THE MOSQUITOES\
  \ along!! That is when I cannot take it any more- I must retreat to my safe haven\
  \ of air conditioner and WIFI.\n\nThis first world princess can only take so much\
  \ !!!!"
