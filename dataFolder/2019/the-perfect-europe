Text: "In the map nailed to the wall of my room, I could see the pins marking the\
  \ places in Europe that I would visit, small reminders of an adventure yet to come.\n\
  At my insistence, my mother decided to take my sister and I on holiday to Europe.\
  \ That summer, in a ridiculous attempt to climb a tree behind the house, pretending\
  \ to be Mount Everest, one of the branches fell down, and I broke my arm at two\
  \ different places.\nI tried to argue that I could still make the trip, but I already\
  \ knew from my mother's gaze that there was no way we could go the day after. I\
  \ was angry with myself. I spent a few weeks in a complete state of tears, not for\
  \ the broken arm, but the ruined trip.\nJanuary finally came to an end and my recovery\
  \ was still lethargic to my frustration. I went to bed early almost every night,\
  \ already counting the days until the end of the summer.\nThe next day, my mother\
  \ woke me up early. Immediately I thought it was the day to remove the plaster,\
  \ which was definitely not the case. I got ready quickly, and before I knew it,\
  \ we were leaving through the front door. The bus stop was five minutes from home.\n\
  For a few minutes we sat by the window until we entered the station. Her smile brightened\
  \ with every step we took. I noticed that we were going to the bus stop called Rua\
  \ do Sol; I remembered that this was the bus we used to catch to go to the City,\
  \ and I wondered if it would not really be to remove my plaster after all.\nWhat\
  \ I did not expect to find on the Mauricio de Nassau Bridge was a small trip that\
  \ my mother had planned only for me.\nThat day I discovered that Recife was divided\
  \ in the half, the Recife that I knew, and the neighbourhood of Recife, or as other\
  \ people call it, the Old Recife, unknown to me. My mother led me to the Golden\
  \ Chapel, completed in 1724, under the imposing baroque style, the gold around the\
  \ images of the saints flickering at sunlight that invaded the chapel through the\
  \ big windows.\nWe went to Pra\xE7a da Republica, in front of the Pal\xE1cio do\
  \ Campo das Princesas, and right there, cutting the blue of the sky and the green\
  \ of one of the rivers that cut the city in two, a pink building, the Santa Isabel\
  \ Theatre stood, dazzling.\nWe stop at Bar\xE3o do Rio Branco Square, known as Marco\
  \ Zero, where an immense rose of the winds starts the neighbourhood. Capibaribe\
  \ River bathes that area, forming a dyke, from where one can see at distance several\
  \ strange sculptures, as if they came from another world.\nWhen we sat down in the\
  \ Casa Forte Park, the ice cream in our hands, the green of the trees and the pond,\
  \ and the gold of the sky, I leaned my head against my mother and cried.\nShe asked\
  \ me if my arm hurt, which I denied several times; she asked what the problem was,\
  \ though. The truth is that I had just visited the perfect Europe, my Europe, with\
  \ the most extraordinary person in the world. My mother."
