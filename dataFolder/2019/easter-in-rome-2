Text: "Growing up, I read about Roman gods and Emperors. About Julius Caesar and Agrippa,\
  \ the Aurelian walls and the gladiators at the Coliseum. I traveled through time,\
  \ as I imagined myself living multiple lives. From Cicero, the champion of wit and\
  \ knowledge, to the legend of Spartacus, the rebel from Thrace. This was all before\
  \ I knew about google, so my weekends were spent in the library, the only place\
  \ I could find Encyclopedia\u2019s and History books. \nI made a promise to myself,\
  \ that I would visit these places one day.\nYears later, in 2018, I finally had\
  \ my chance.\nI did a tour of Italy, from Trieste, to Venice, Padova, Milan, Florence\
  \ and finally Rome. I planned it so I could celebrate Easter at the Vatican. I\u2019\
  m catholic you see.\nI got to Rome just before 12am. Tiburtina Bus Station was just\
  \ a few minutes\u2019 walk from my hotel. The plan was to start exploring the city\
  \ early the next day, but Rome had other plans for me.\nIn all my other trips, besides\
  \ drowning in the zeitgeist and learning about the history of the town or city from\
  \ locals, I tried to also curate the cuisine and architecture. Right from the Station,\
  \ I was sucked into a kaleidoscope of Baroque and Renaissance styled buildings.\
  \ It was like every building was in competition with the other, with their magnificent\
  \ columns and beautiful gargoyles. And yet they found a way to seamlessly blend,\
  \ so much that nothing seemed out of place. What was supposed to be a 20minute walk\
  \ to my hotel, turned into a night crawling expedition, hungrily hunting the next\
  \ surreal facade. \nAt about 2:30am, I decided it was time to head to the hotel.\
  \ I followed as directed by my maps, and watched the distance shorten every other\
  \ minute. At some point, I stumbled on what at first, I thought was a misplaced\
  \ brick. Poised to curse, I adjusted my backpack and brushed of the dust from my\
  \ trousers. I zoomed in on the on screen map to see just how far away the hotel\
  \ was. That was when I noticed the red pointer on the screen, exactly where I was\
  \ standing, labeled \u201CServian Wall\u201D.\nA part of the Aurelian wall. One\
  \ of the places I\u2019d planned to see. \nMy eyes followed the brick I\u2019d struck,\
  \ revealing an aged wall with the remains of what used to be an outpost for soldiers.\
  \ The street lights were bright enough to notice the plaque up above,  \u201C ANNO.\
  \ DN CCLXXV\u201D , Anno. Domini 275.\nAs I ran my hands along the wall, I wondered\
  \ how many of the names in the books I\u2019d read had done the same. I was here,\
  \ walking the same sands Caesar once walked.\nI finally borrowed under warm blankets\
  \ at about 4:00am, with a big smile and thoughts about the ancient beauty I would\
  \ be exploring later.\n\nI was up by 7:00am. A little tired, but still very much\
  \ buzzed about what I would find. I decided it would be best to walk all through,\
  \ as there\u2019d definitely be things or places I\u2019d miss if I took a bus.\
  \ \nMy first stop was just around the corner, the Palazzo Massimo alle Terme, a\
  \ Neo-Renaissance palace with a classical art collection. As with the rest of the\
  \ buildings from its era, the museum was a magnificent work of art. The fountains\
  \ provided a beautiful picturesque backdrop for tourists, and the ambience was of\
  \ royalty.\nPrevious writings did no justice to the majestic Coliseum. When our\
  \ turn came to explore the grounds, I stood in what could\u2019ve been the middle\
  \ and imagined Maximus Decimus Meridius fighting of beasts and rolling off sand\
  \ and blood to avoid deadly chariots. I walked around this colossal arena, and had\
  \ only thoughts of awe.\nFor the rest of my trip, I redefined what beauty meant\
  \ for me. Rome was like a monument from another era, there to remind us of the grandeur\
  \ that is the human mind.\nMy mind expanded to accommodate all that I had seen,\
  \ and heard, and learnt. My eyes saw things in new ways. And my heart, it bled for\
  \ those that never travel."
