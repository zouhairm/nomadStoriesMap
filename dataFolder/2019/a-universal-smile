Text: "The smiling face of an elderly woman caught my attention on my daily scroll\
  \ through Facebook. The title read \u201Cobituary\u201D in Romanian, along with\
  \ many other words I didn\u2019t recognize in her native tongue. I knew her. I knew\
  \ this smiling face; a face that smiled at me from three beds away; a face who held\
  \ my hand and lent a hug; a face who sent her English speaking daughter to check\
  \ on me during my hospital stay; and a face that was no longer able to smile radiantly\
  \ at anyone else. \n\nThree short months prior, I was incapacitated on a stretcher\
  \ in the back of a Romanian ambulance with medics surrounding me like a thick forest\
  \ and speaking in a language that sounded like gibberish. Racing me into the hospital\
  \ and leaving me in the hallway like an animal exhibit in a zoo for all to stare\
  \ gormlessly at, while they went to find a doctor. Time elapsed rapidly as a nurse\
  \ rushed me into a room that is now just a blur, making this the fastest I had ever\
  \ received attention in a hospital in my then 23 years of life. \n\n\u201CYou are\
  \ a stubborn idiot\u201D the surgeon yelled at me, frustrated, after I refused surgery,\
  \ \u201CYour Gallbladder will explode and you will die\u201D. I didn\u2019t care.\
  \ \u201CNot in this country\u201D I managed to croak out indignantly, not caring\
  \ how this left him feeling. \n\nI wish I could say I made the wrong decision, but\
  \ as I was forced to walk up stairs and remain in the clothes I had come in whilst\
  \ admitted to the surgical ward; I would soon discover the horror that lay ahead.\n\
  \nAs I was left alone, I made my way to the bathroom to relieve my stomach of the\
  \ various pain killers and medications that were currently residing in it. All I\
  \ wanted to do was wipe my mouth clean and wash my hands, but quickly discovered\
  \ that both toilet paper and hand soap were a nonexistent commodity. Here I sat,\
  \ with the threat of death looming over head, dirty hands, and remnants of my own\
  \ sick on my mouth. \n\nWalking through three different rooms; all attached and\
  \ filled with eight beds each; I climbed into what would be my old fashioned metal\
  \ hospital bed for the next three days in this faraway country and allowed sleep\
  \ to engulf me. \n\nEach day remained the same: the nurse changed my intravenous\
  \ three times a day and tried to sympathetically speak to me in Romanian; followed\
  \ by the doctor doing his rounds and trying desperately to talk me into surgery;\
  \ a short visit from my housemate who generously brought me clean clothes, food\
  \ (that I wasn\u2019t allowed to eat), water, soap and toilet paper; a conversation\
  \ trying to talk my mother out of hopping the next plane to Romania. The days were\
  \ long and I was metaphorically chained to my bed with no fresh air. \n\nAround\
  \ me women spoke to each other lovingly, as they folded bandages and laughed about\
  \ their bile bags that were attached to them post surgery. Although old fashioned\
  \ and far from elaborate as a hospital with absolutely no privacy, this was my home\
  \ for three days and every single day without fail, one observant and loving lady\
  \ would come and sit on my bed and hold my hand while speaking to me in Romanian.\
  \ She knew. She knew I was far from home and really sick. She knew I was scared\
  \ and she knew I had family worrying about me. She knew and she sat with me because\
  \ a smile is a universal language and a hug is a universal comfort and that was\
  \ all the communication we needed to be friends.  \n\nOn the final evening of my\
  \ stay her daughter arrived to take her home to have a shower (a luxury not provided\
  \ at the hospital). Approaching me, her daughter informed me that her mom wanted\
  \ to make sure that I was okay; she spoke English. She translated and she listened\
  \ and together we laughed. \nTwo women from two different generations in a foreign\
  \ country in a nightmare of a situation became friends all because of a smile; a\
  \ smile staring back on an obituary informing me that cancer won the the battle."
