Text: "My last trip was to Japan. Despite of I\u2019m living now in the country next\
  \ to Japan, I had at least nontransparent viewpoints about Japan. This is du\u0443\
  \ to  I never read the other traveler\u2019s feedback. Otherwise a feedbacks bring\
  \ a kind of expectations, which I always try to avoid. I decided to let Japan make\
  \ me get impressed or get disappointed at all as any other country for traveling.\
  \ \n  As the most important part of my travel was Nagoya Women Marathon. At the\
  \ same period I was running for prepare to the race and was watching several movies\
  \ about Japan. I must admit that one of the movies impressed me a lot. Although\
  \ the storyline was about the different between two cultures- west and east. So\
  \ I got ready to come across something exotic. However, I was curious about similarity\
  \ with my country. Moreover I had to get experienced to a sport culture of this\
  \ country. In short, I was excited and looking forward to my travel. \nAs my vacation\
  \ was pretty short I planned to hit up to Nagoya and after head to Tokyo . \LThe\
  \ first what happened to me in Japan was an injury. I squashed my finger in a taxi\
  \ door at the airport. That\u2019s not the best start for a positive- minded traveler.\
  \ But the taxi driver regret about it so much and started to bow, that  made even\
  \ me feel guilty. \L\nAfter in search of a pharmacy my friend and I had to walk\
  \ along the night Nagoya. Even my finger hurt I was enjoying with a narrow and wide\
  \ streets, huge variety of architecture, passers-by, smells, sounds. There is a\
  \ ferris wheel, and next to it is a small pagoda with cherry blossoms. Right after\
  \ there located kind of old building like it's from 80's and there is no an open\
  \ pharmacy on the way.  Here is a girl with lush green hair and her partner in a\
  \ black suit, apparently after working in the office. Lights, lights, lights, but\
  \ no fuss. The city lives the own life in its measured pace. \n   It is worth wandering\
  \ a little deeper into the small streets and you find yourself in silence, illuminated\
  \ only by the moon. After a couple of hours, I realized that I was no longer looking\
  \ for an open pharmacy, but rather enjoying the fresh coolness of night Nagoya.\
  \ The injured finger miraculously stopped hurting, but only assumed an honest dark-\
  \ blue color and was slightly heated. It seemed that the very atmosphere of the\
  \ city healed him. It became cozy and calm, which means a time for trying some delicious\
  \ Japanese food. \n  How surprised I was seeing the city in the daytime. Sports\
  \ travel has a huge pluses. One of them is running the marathon distance of 26 miles\
  \ you can observe the whole city in full view. Just imagine, empty roads for a runners\
  \ without cars along the most beautiful streets of the city. \nI am surprised at\
  \ how ambiguous Nagoya is. In some part, the city looks like a Chinese province\
  \ with a crooked houses, but somewhere with its neglect it resembles the times of\
  \ the Soviet Union, where I'm from. And somewhere it's a truely accurate, expressive\
  \ Japan.\n  But most of all Japanese people were the biggest joy for us. These well-mannered,\
  \ courteous and responsive Japanese. And no matter how difficult it was with the\
  \ lack of pointers in English, with the inability to fully use VISA cards, that\
  \  Japanese concern for those who are now next to you has done fully compensated\
  \ for all the shortcomings. Definitely, it is people who are the real face of the\
  \ country.\n  I except  Japan with all its variety of colors and shapes, with all\
  \ the chasing and odd passersby. I have the impression that Japan is not deceiving.\
  \ It's the same for its inhabitants, for tourists, for those who love or do not\
  \ love the country a lot. Japan does not try to be good.\nHaving gotten my finisher\
  \ medal, I moved towards the capital. But Tokyo is a different story. This is Japan\
  \ at 100% with scales, all traffic, queues and other problems of a big city."
