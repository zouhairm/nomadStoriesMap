Text: "Six days, 23 hours, 8640 minutes, and 518400 seconds. Snow-capped mountains\
  \ and the salty briny air my reward among many, for the long journey across Canada.\
  \  I push a bramble of spruce branch away from my face and step into the solid clearing\
  \ surrounded by the tallest, biggest tree trunks I had ever seen.\nStanley Park,\
  \ Vancouver, BC. This is the first place on my list. It is the end of April and\
  \ the greenery takes my breath away. Being from the East coast, I am used to the\
  \ world still being brown until the beginning of May, when the threat of snow was\
  \ not as imminent. Here, there is no evidence that snow has ever touched this haven.\
  \ The sounds of the birds calling to each other becomes a melody.\nA big black creature\
  \ scurries towards me, the sounds of the brown earth beneath his little paws making\
  \ a staccato rhythm. Upon further inspection, able to get a good look as he climbs\
  \ from one huge redwood tree to the next, that it is a squirrel. I smile. How cute.\n\
  \u201CThey are pretty big, aren\u2019t they?\u201D A voice says behind me. I jump\
  \ and turn around. An elderly man tanned from a life spent under the sun steps out\
  \ from behind a tree. He takes off his worn dirty sun hat and looks sheepish.\n\u201C\
  Sorry for startling you. I come out here to birdwatch. And watch these little critters\
  \ that I find fascinating. \u201CI smile and nod, not sure how to proceed.\nHe takes\
  \ an orange out of his back pocket, and a knife out of the other pocket of his brown\
  \ cargo shorts and starts peeling. He intently stares at the squirrel, who is now\
  \ a few feet away from him, staring at the orange, twitching. The man smiles and\
  \ bends down. He extracts a piece of orange and holds out it out to the critter.\
  \ The squirrel takes it greedily and scurries away. \nHe remains squatted, frowning\
  \ at the brown dirt beneath his worn white joggers. He puts his hand out, balancing\
  \ the orange in one hand with the knife and picks up some pine nettles. He smells\
  \ them, examines them, frowns, and tosses them back into the Earth. \nHe stands\
  \ back up, tips his hat at me and turns back the way he has come. \nI watch him\
  \ retreat, his skeleton frame hunched over as he eats his orange. The late afternoon\
  \ sun casting shadows on his white flannel shirt. Finally, he is so far away I can\u2019\
  t see him as good and I continue my journey.\nI think about the old man, and what\
  \ his journey through life must have been like, his skin weathered face, his lived-in\
  \ attire, his eyes full of wisdom. \nThe path I continue to walk along is growing\
  \ sparser with forest, and I start to hear the sounds of people. Children laughing,\
  \ music, and the sounds of bicycles. \nI decide to go off the beaten path and make\
  \ a path of my own, climbing over fallen redwoods, that are so massive I can not\
  \ believe they are real. Wildlife has made homes out of these fallen comrades evident\
  \ by the holes burrowed in them. I push away brambles and thorns and come to a hill.\n\
  A grassy slope overlooking paradise. Or the closest thing I had ever been to such\
  \ a place.\nIt is four seasons in one.  The mountains in the distance the epitome\
  \ of heaven. There is still snow at the very highest peak. Down on the ground, there's\
  \ a different season present, summer.  The Pacific Ocean is a mix of blue and green,\
  \ and the sailboats in the water, little white caps bobbing. The beige sand is dotted\
  \ with people playing, reading, laying and singing. The trees hovering near the\
  \ walking path have shades of gold, mimicking the season of fall. Lastly, there\
  \ is the wind, not chilly, not fierce, but soothing, reminding us that it is, in\
  \ fact, spring, but here in this beautiful part of the world, you could pretend\
  \ it is the season of your choosing. I look up at the wide expanse of cloudless\
  \ blue and give thanks for this beautiful planet."
