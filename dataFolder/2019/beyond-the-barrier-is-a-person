Text: "The first challenge traveling abroad is language barriers especially when the\
  \ official language is different from our own. It doesn\u2019t matter why you\u2019\
  re there, but interacting with natives is unavoidable, and in most cases, it makes\
  \ a difference in the kind of experience you have or what kind of people you meet.\
  \ \n\nMy first time traveling abroad was for a college study tour in Paris. I\u2019\
  d been fluent in French for years and I took the opportunity to use what I know.\
  \ When I took my seat on Air Tahiti headed towards Charles de Gaule (CDG) airport,\
  \ I immediately made myself accustom to the multilingual chatter from flight attendants,\
  \ settling passengers, and announcements repeated in Tahitian, French, and English.\
  \ During those eleven hours, I was mentally preparing myself to enter a world outside\
  \ my native language.\n\nThe following Monday, after arriving, we were scheduled\
  \ to visit a man by the name of Bruno, the fourth generation owner to the House\
  \ of Legeron, an old atelier for custom couture flower and feather designs...but\
  \ he didn\u2019t speak English. Our European director was interpreting since no\
  \ one else in our group spoke French. \n\nWhen everyone was off taking pictures,\
  \ I took the opportunity to introduce myself, in French, and he looked surprised.\
  \ Bruno managed to warm up to me by making a few jokes and asked me to interpret\
  \ while our European director stepped out to make a call. That was the first moment\
  \ on the trip I wasn\u2019t viewed with the \u201Cignorant American\u201D filter\
  \ but for who I was... a person. \n\nAfter that, I had several encounters like this\
  \ with many locals. I felt like I had something special allowing me to stand out\
  \ from most American tourists. I had new confidence.\n\nI stopped for lunch at a\
  \ bistro with some girls before heading to a Martin Margiela Exhibit, one asked\
  \ the waiter, \u201CWhat is the most popular entree on the menu?\u201D\n\nThe waiter\
  \ seemed a little puzzled. \u201CQuoi?\u201D [What?]\n\n\u201CWhat\u2019s the most\
  \ popular entree on the menu!\u201D She repeated only louder the second time. By\
  \ the third time she repeated herself, she was just yelling at him. He probably\
  \ didn\u2019t know fluent English or simply didn\u2019t want to.\n\nIn translation,\
  \ \u201CElle veut savoir, qu\u2019est-ce que c\u2019est l'entr\xE9e plus populaire\
  \ sur la carte.\u201D I said looking up from my menu.\n\nPrior to making that statement,\
  \ the waiter blatantly put his hand in her face, \u201CJe ne parle pas Anglais!\u201D\
  \ [I don\u2019t speak English] and turned to listen to me. His whole demeanor completely\
  \ changed as I spoke. Upon placing my order, I saw him smile at me! I didn\u2019\
  t see him do the same for the others. Language has a power of its own.\n\nBefore\
  \ returning to Los Angeles, that same group and I were looking for the metro stop\
  \ to our hotel and decided to ask someone and we met a man at a bar with tied-back\
  \ blond hair, a sweater knotted over his shoulders, and a slight German accent.\
  \ \n\n\u201CDo you know how to get to Ga\xEEt\xE9?\u201D One of the girls asked.\n\
  \nI translated, \u201CNous devons retourner \xE0 notre hotel.\u201D [We must return\
  \ to our hotel].\n\nThis man instantaneously turned my direction. \u201CYou speak\
  \ French?\u201D\n\nI nodded while everyone ad-libbed in agreement. \n\n\u201CAre\
  \ you really good?\u201D\n\nI nodded again. \u201CYes.\u201D \n\n\u201COk, I only\
  \ tell you.\u201D He said with a semi-flirtatious smirk before giving me the directions\
  \ in French. \n\nThis voyage was life-changing not because I was in Paris of all\
  \ cities. It was eye-opening based on how locals treated me. I spoke their language.\
  \ I understood them. I was one of them. \n\nPeople don\u2019t always understand\
  \ the power of language between one another. Language has the power to move people,\
  \ ignite fires of inspiration within souls, and manifest authentic human relationships\
  \ connecting one person to the heart of another.\n\n In the spirit of Nelson Mandela,\
  \ \u201CIf you talk to a man in a language he understands, it goes to his head.\
  \ If you talk to him in his language, it goes to his heart.\u201D Regardless of\
  \ the language you speak, you don\u2019t know whose path you\u2019ll cross until\
  \ you overcome that language barrier and reach into the heart of another person."
