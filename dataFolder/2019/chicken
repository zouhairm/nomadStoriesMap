Text: "The soft plunking of strings echoed in the Hostal EL Canaonazo restaurant in\
  \ Havana, Cuba. My sister and I and a group of our classmates were sitting at a\
  \ big table, the table one might see in the movies, its old; there are tears and\
  \ scratches on the surface.  We\u2019re sitting in big wooden chairs with poor pillows\
  \ on the seats, different portraits of people and animals decorate the walls; as\
  \ the strumming of guitar music filter through the air. \n\tWe\u2019re at an old\
  \ building, time hasn\u2019t been exactly kind to the building, like all established\
  \ buildings in Havana everything is falling apart.  But our tour guide Mike, promised\
  \ us that restaurant Hostal EL Canaonazo had one of the best dinners to be found\
  \ in Havana.  The earthly rich smells of chicken, beans and rice waver in the air,\
  \ as fresh breads and tortillas coming in and out of the kitchen.\n\tThere\u2019\
  s about ten of us at this dinner party, we got into the restaurant on time but time\
  \ is slow in Cuba as we\u2019ve discovered and it took time to get seated. But we\u2019\
  re finally seated and most of us have ordered friend chicken, rice and black beans.\
  \ Some of us began talking about our stay so far in Cuba, when one of our classmates,\
  \ Melissa noticed that different chickens are running around the restaurant.\n\t\
  \u201CDon\u2019t you think that\u2019s odd?\u201D she asks me, I\u2019m sitting\
  \ across from her, not realizing what she\u2019s asking me about.\n\t\u201CWhat\u2019\
  s odd?\u201D\n\tMelissa pointed behind me, I turn to look and find different chickens\
  \ on the ground or in the islands of plants.\n\t\u201CNot really,\u201D I reply,\
  \ \u201CThey\u2019re probably keeping the chickens around for pest control.\u201D\
  \n\t\u201CWhere do you think they get them?\u201D she asks not just me but our group\
  \ in general. I\u2019m puzzled by her question, not sure why it\u2019s so strange\
  \ to see chickens running around the restaurant.  One of the things we\u2019ve learned\
  \ since being in Cuba has been how very third world it is, Cuba doesn\u2019t have\
  \ the same things like America does, doesn\u2019t have the same restrictions that\
  \ American restaurants have and must abide by.\n\t\u201CThey\u2019ve probably got\
  \ them from some local farmer, or maybe they have a hen house in the back of restaurant.\u201D\
  \ I replied to her while I\u2019m eating my chicken.  It\u2019s a different fried\
  \ chicken, not the KFC type which my sister and I have grown up with, it\u2019s\
  \ moist and the spices are more Mexican/Caribbean and the black beans and rice have\
  \ their own flavoring as well.\n\tOther people in our group are eating their food\
  \ too, most the same dish while a few are trying a few different dishes.  I take\
  \ my time eating the huge chicken breast, stirring the contents of rice, beans and\
  \ chicken together.  It\u2019s been a long day of traveling, we\u2019ve checked\
  \ out different areas of Havana, seeing old embassy buildings of the U.S. and Russia;\
  \ art work by different people. My sister told me while I was visiting an artist\
  \ with the art students, that she and another group of students attended a lecture.\
  \ \n\tMy sister Emily, found the lecture humbling, not realizing how many people\
  \ depended on food rations, how many people starved in the early years of communism.\
  \  I tell her it\u2019s sad that so many people suffered, I can\u2019t imagine to\
  \ go through something like that but it\u2019s a reality for people in Cuba. We\u2019\
  re silent for a moment, when Melissa spoke up again; I\u2019ve noticed that she\u2019\
  s been watching the chickens with interest, she\u2019s been pointing out a few of\
  \ the chickens to some of our classmates, admiring their different feathers.\n\t\
  \u201CWhat do you think happens to the chickens?\u201D she asks to know no one particular,\
  \ a few of our classmates look at her quizzically, not sure how to answer her.\n\
  \t\u201CI think we\u2019re eating them.\u201D I tell her gently, indicating to my\
  \ plate and her plate of food.  Melissa stopped eating for a moment and gazed down\
  \ at her plate as the realization hits her.\n\t\u201CI wouldn\u2019t worry about\
  \ it,\u201D I tell her, \u201CThey wouldn\u2019t be the first restaurant or the\
  \ last to use the chickens this way.\u201D"
