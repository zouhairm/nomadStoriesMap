Text: "Along a bumpy road on the outskirts of Antigua, Guatemala lies a small town\
  \ by the name of San Lorenzo. Here the hills are steeped with plastic shacks and\
  \ skeletal buildings. Stray dogs run beside trucks entombed in dust. Skipping between\
  \ patches of shade, their frail frames are unyielding to the harsh sun. In this\
  \ forgotten town a young mother left in sole care of her four children, a baby on\
  \ the way, opened her world to us.  \nWalking through her unassuming wooden doorway,\
  \ I felt my toes slip to the front of my sandals; a response to the steep incline\
  \ of the dirt lying just inside. This was the kitchen and yet it resembled not at\
  \ all my own. Burning firewood placed in the corner left the air smoky and thick.\
  \ A sheet swayed overhead to mask the sun. The air was musky and filled with the\
  \ ruffle of feathers, hinting chickens were nearby.  Through the makeshift kitchen\
  \ and out from under the billowy overhang sat the sagging frames of huts along a\
  \ concrete wall.  Constructed of weathered bits of metal and black trash bags, I\
  \ was amazed they had lasted any amount of time.\nFor three days, we showed up,\
  \ knocked on the weathered door, waited as we heard the bark of dogs and muffled\
  \ Spanish, until the door swung open and onto the smiling faces of Maritza and her\
  \ family. We were always greeted with warmth, not solely because we were there to\
  \ build the Zamora\u2019s a home, but because that is the Guatemalan way. In no\
  \ other place does arrant poverty so often coincide with gratitude and generosity.\
  \  Guatemalan\u2019s will welcome a stranger into their home, feed them the little\
  \ they have to feed themselves, and then thank them for coming over! The ever-helpful\
  \ attitude and cheery disposition found in nearly all Guatemalans is admirable.\
  \ It\u2019s an approach to life that will make you fall in love with the country\
  \ over and over. \nVolunteering is an arduous route to experience Guatemala, but\
  \ experience it you will. Surrounded by roaming chickens and ghostly frames of starving\
  \ dogs, I began to understand the people of Guatemala and what weaves the fabric\
  \ of their culture. Guatemala\u2019s past is steeped in years of oppressive rulers,\
  \ civil strife, U.S. backed dictatorships and military coups. It is a country washed\
  \ so often in the murky waters of its people\u2019s suffering. Yet there remains\
  \ hope, a cheery outlook donned each day by the Mayan women; their arms piled high\
  \ with huipil, hoping to sell for a few quetzals, the material of a culture that\
  \ has endured for a millennium. It is a world ripe for the senses: the sound of\
  \ crackling wood under a comal, the sweet taste of elote, its kernels bathed in\
  \ colorful chilies and cheese, and the rhythmic swaying of the woven hammock beneath\
  \ you. \nOur time at the Zamora\u2019s compound was spent covered in dirt, stiff\
  \ from mixing and pouring concrete by hand.  The children, eager to participate\
  \ in the action, hauled wood and cement blocks, their feet only covered by the mud\
  \ from their back yard. The homes, an effort by the organization Nuestros Ahijados,\
  \ are basic but afford families a safer future in a land rife with earthquakes and\
  \ volcanic activity. When we finished, streaked with the blue paint left to dry\
  \ on the exterior walls, we were rewarded with the tears of Maritza\u2019s children\
  \ joyfully exploring their first house. It was this moment, engulfed by the smile\
  \ of Luis, Maritza\u2019s oldest boy, which I will pull from the forgotten ruins\
  \ of my mind when I am old and gray."
