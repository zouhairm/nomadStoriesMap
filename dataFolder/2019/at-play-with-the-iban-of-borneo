Text: "\u201CMissus! Auntie! Grandma!\u201D \nI had just arrived at the Sarawak Cultural\
  \ Village, on the Santubong\_Peninsula near Kuching, when the girls organising the\
  \ Strong Man Competition loudly claimed me.  I did the classic double-take you do\
  \ when someone unexpectedly recognises you in a foreign county and then I remembered\
  \ them. At the Rainforest Music Festival in June the previous year,  at this same\
  \ site, they had plied me with drink, dressed me in a feather headdress, taught\
  \ me a few simple dance steps and posed me for the obligatory group selfies. I\u2019\
  d had fun.\n\n\u201COh, Cheeky Girls! Hello!\u201D I waved back. I mimed an invitation\
  \ to a drink later, pointing to the nearest beer tent. A few competitors invited\
  \ themselves along, mimicking me with exaggerated movements and the audience laughed\
  \ with us. Such a very Iban welcome - warm, playful and inclusive.\n\nThe Iban are\
  \ those jungle-dwelling, blow-pipe hunting head-takers that made Borneo infamous.\
  \ In the 21st century, they are more city-dwelling, and mobile-phone-wielding but\
  \ the spirit of village life is still strong. Each April, at the end of the wet\
  \ season, they hold this Harvest and Folklore Festival to ensure it continues. \n\
  \nThe Strong Man Competition is a festival highlight.  For three days, in the blistering\
  \ heat, big men threw tree-trunks over their heads across a bar behind them about\
  \ the hight of a small house; staggered up and back a football pitch carrying two\
  \ tractor tires full of concrete suspended from a metal bar across their shoulders;\
  \ chopped and carried cords of wood; you get the picture. I don\u2019t know who\
  \ won. The crowd's reaction to each award was equally enthusiastic.  I don\u2019\
  t think competition is really an Iban thing and everyone was celebrated for their\
  \ efforts. \n\nA more sedate challenge was the food competition centred around carved\
  \ fruit and artfully plated dishes and the popular vote was obvious by the long\
  \ queues at the jungle-food stalls. Everywhere was music and dance and once again\
  \ the Cheeky Girls caught up with me, this time at the Sape Workshop. The sape is\
  \ a short-necked, long-bodied lute unique to Borneo. The players, mostly old men,\
  \ wore intricate headdresses of silver, feathers and the beaks of Hornbills.  After\
  \ the workshop they allowed us to wear them. Once again the Cheeky Girls bedecked\
  \ me in dead bird for selfies. \n\nThe main event was an epic musical theatre performance\
  \ set in the 19th century depicting the life of the great Iban strong man, Rentap,\
  \ and his final battle against James Brooke, the Englishman who would become the\
  \ White Raj of Sarawak.  We were seated one side of an artificial lake while the\
  \ performance, for the most part, took place around the traditional Iban longhouse\
  \ on the opposite bank. It was noisy and dramatic with a cast of about 100, lots\
  \ of cultural references and inside jokes, evil spirits, and a pyrotechnic river\
  \ battle in decorated canoes.\n\nA bamboo bridge over the lake occasionally brought\
  \ the action to our side of the water. Once, when we were immersed in a peaceful\
  \ village scene, we were suddenly attacked. Think kickboxing with machetes.  Screaming\
  \ women and children ran into the audience to be dragged away, kicking and wailing,\
  \ by warriors feigning threats at the audience who were also screaming, recoiling,\
  \ falling back into the next row. The melee was terrific. The story ends with Rentap\
  \ escaping to the mountains and Brooke and his wife standing victorious. \n\nAfter\
  \ the play, I saw some people leaving via the bamboo bridge and decided to join\
  \ them. I didn\u2019t realise they were the official party on their way to a formal\
  \ dinner in the longhouse. Typical of the Iban, they politely insisted I join them.\
  \ We sat on woven mats and were entertained while we dined from a wealth of silver\
  \ dishes. There were a few other travellers at my table and at the end of the meal\
  \ we were invited to dance. I took this opportunity to slip out the side door. \
  \ On the verandah, in the dark, the actors were watching and I turned to see what\
  \ so enthralled them. In a halo of soft night, to sape music, a handsome English\
  \ couple danced a slow victory waltz."
