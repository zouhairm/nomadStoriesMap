Text: "I had never travelled on my own or been to Asia when, in 2016, I decided to\
  \ stop college for six months and head to Southeast Asia all by myself. That\u2019\
  s when my love for solo travelling begun and how my life got a new porpoise. I started\
  \ the four months trip working in a hostel in Krabi (south of Thailand), a place\
  \ surrounded only by mountains and by transparent ocean waters.\n\nOne of my duties\
  \ at the hostel was to organize group trips around the region and once I was able\
  \ to gather ten people for a day trip to waterfalls, temples and natural pools.\
  \ The day arrived and everyone was super excited - we were from all around the world\
  \ and mostly young solo travellers. The van was big, had air conditioning and was\
  \ filled with the sound of travelling experiences being shared.\n\nAround 3 pm we\
  \ had arrived at the place I was counting the minutes to visit: the Emerald Pool,\
  \ a massive natural pool with water as green as the precious rock it is named after.\
  \ We all barely saw the place and were already taking our clothes off. Actually,\
  \ not all of us. A couple from the group was looking a bit uncertain, so I approached\
  \ them and asked what was wrong. \n\nThey looked around and told me, without any\
  \ embarrassment, that the place was too packed and that there was \u201CToo many\
  \ Thai people\u201D. I wanted to angrily reply \u201CReally?! A piece of news for\
  \ you: This is Thailand!\u201D, but the shock and the fact that I was working made\
  \ me just say \u201COk..\u201D. They informed me that they would wait in the van\
  \ for the three whole hours we were supposed to be there.\n\nAsking around, I discovered\
  \ that it was a special school day and many of the Thai teenager visitors were part\
  \ of school trips. The place was huge and, even crowed, was still pleasant. Me and\
  \ the rest of the group talked a lot, laughed, slid from the waterfall and played\
  \ water games. I tried to talk with some of the Thai teenagers and, through the\
  \ universal language of mimics, I understood their names, ages and how giggly they\
  \ were. When it was time to head back, we found the couple sleeping in a freezing\
  \ pitch-black van.\n\nWe arrived at the hostel 15 minutes before dinner time - an\
  \ out of this world, delicious family-style dinner. I sat with my boss and told\
  \ him about the situation with the couple. He was not surprised at all and said\
  \ that that type of comment was very common, coming from people from all around\
  \ the world and from all different types of travellers.\n\nI spent over a month\
  \ in Thailand, exploring eight cities and eating absolutely all the street food\
  \ my body could bear. I found out that, even being known for its amazing scenarios\
  \ (and they are absolutely outstanding!), Thailand is way more than that. It\u2019\
  s cliche to say that the local people is what travelling is really about, but Thailand\
  \ and Southeast Asia are proof of that. \u201CSoutheast Asians\u201D are predominantly\
  \ welcoming, smiley, helpful (even if only with gestures), respectful of women,\
  \ fun and profoundly interesting.\n\nIf at the beginning of my trip the couple\u2019\
  s sentence was already shocking to me, by the end of the four months it became simply\
  \ unacceptable. I\u2019ve learned that, in the most touristic places, is rare to\
  \ see Thai people visiting, as the prices are way too high for them. The eight years\
  \ old boy that lived in the hostel in Krabi, for example, had never visited the\
  \ Emerald Pool or took a 1h30 ferry to see the famous Koh Phi Phi.\n\nSo, when in\
  \ Thailand, expect to find millions of Thai people and hope to find more and more\
  \ of them exploring their own country! Tourism is an industry with so many topics\
  \ to be discussed and redesigned, but maybe the first of them is making people understand\
  \ that you can only really get to a know a beautiful place if you also get to know\
  \ the culture, the history and, most importantly, the people."
