Text: 'I love schools and what they bring with them into the society. I have been
  working in the field of sustainability for about two years at the Ministry of Education
  of the City of Buenos Aires and I have seen really close how schools of the city
  work with the help of the goverment to improve their education in sustainable development
  and how they apply the new knowledge in the system. Having seen so many commited
  people and loving teachers and colleagues working so hard made me think that this
  is the way we are really improving our house, the planet earth.

  Beause of that when I heard that Michael Reynaolds, originally from the US as part
  of the movement earthship was going to create a new school about 500 kilometres
  from Buenos Aires only made of decarded materials like used bottles with sand inside
  working as bricks and in other parts of that school he and a team of about 200 volunteers
  from all over the world were part of this amazing work day by day in that area of
  the argentinean coast, not a very populated one.I thought to myself, I didnt expect
  that, sustainable development started in the US and Northern Europe and it was difficult
  for us to bring some people over, but this is just the start, I didnt expect to
  find this amazing revolution 5 hours from Buenos Aires.i know this is just a summary,
  but I wanted to share it with you as is one of the possible stories, then, the rest
  of the stories are not related to sustainability.'
