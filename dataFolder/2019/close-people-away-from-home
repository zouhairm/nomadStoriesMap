Text: 'In the summer of 2017, I and my friend Anton traveled to Georgia. Arriving
  at Tbilisi airport, we rented a car and went to study this unusual, controversial,
  and very beautiful country.

  In the morning we went to the mountains, our path lay along the Georgian military
  road to Mount Kazbek. After watching the gorge and mountains, I went further with
  a friend. In Kakheti homeland Georgian winemaking. It was already late evening when
  we approached the town of Sighnaghi. Heavy rain began, and our car decided to break.
  Timing belt broke.

  It was not far to the settlement, so we decided to walk to find someone who would
  help us reach the station.

  We reached the first yard, the house was located in the thickets of grapes. As soon
  as we reached the gate, the rain stopped. We went into the courtyard, in Georgia,
  many do not lock the gate. Walking along the path to the house, we saw a nice woman,
  40 years old. I explained our situation to her and she said that she would call
  her husband. The man agreed to take our car to the yard with a rope of his car,
  called his friends and after 2 hours we had already changed the belt in the car.
  The hosts insisted that we stayed for dinner, we did not particularly resist.

  The hostess laid a rich table, neighbors came, and in the course of conversations
  we learned that my great-grandfather and grandfather of this woman were fighting
  together in 1941-1945 and together went through the war back to back. That''s how
  I went to look for the most delicious wine and hinkal, and found almost blood relatives.
  By the way, my grandmother and this woman still communicate and share memories.'
