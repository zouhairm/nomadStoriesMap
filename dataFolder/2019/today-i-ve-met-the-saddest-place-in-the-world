Text: "A brief stay in Capilla del Monte can be the excuse to visit \u201Cthe country\
  \ of the Comechingones\u201D. This is the name the place received when it was discovered\
  \ by Spanish colonizers in 1573. Travelling to Ongamira offers good stories about\
  \ shamans, conquerors, hippies and UFOS.\n\nOnce upon a time, journeys were conceived\
  \ as a disconnection from daily life and their inexorable iterations. Just a decade\
  \ ago, when smartphones weren\u2019t that popular yet, to connect with strangers\
  \ to share live chats and events was enjoyable without any further technology. But\
  \ the future arrived already, and adventures streamlined all over the social media\
  \ in real time. In Capilla del Monte, a place in Argentina Cordoba province, the\
  \ connection searched by its visitors is from another type. In this town everything\
  \ alludes to a paranormal imagery and how to meet with that type of \u201Cstranger\
  \ things\u201D: restaurants have names like \u201CLet\u2019s make contact\u201D\
  \ or \u201CI knew you would come\u201D. The unavoidable presence of the Uritorco\
  \ mount, behind the city, is revered by all as if it were an old sacred altar. In\
  \ the aborigine legends, Uritorco was an Indian leader that was cursed for fighting\
  \ for the love of the daughter of the sorcerer and transformed into a mountain,\
  \ while his lover was turned into the Calabalumba river that softly caresses the\
  \ mounts\u2019 slopes and which name means \u201Cwater that sings among the stones\u201D\
  . From the \u201880s, when a big ovoid stain appeared in the hills that was attributed\
  \ to an spaceship landing mark, all kind of alternative philosophers and preachers\
  \ of conspiracies arrived to this \u201Cmagic\u201D place. An abundant and freaky\
  \  merchandising is shown all over the shops like goblins, witches, ETs and twilight\
  \ Tim Burton\u2019s animated films characters. The type of architecture that is\
  \ predominantly found in town are old big houses from the \u201830s of the last\
  \ century with spacious galleries that were the delight of Buenos Aires bourgeoisie,\
  \ who used to search rellief in the clean air of this region for common diseases\
  \ of the time like tuberculosis. During the night you can be suprised by sudden\
  \ swirls of wind with no apparently direction while thunders can be heard from the\
  \ mount side. The trip to Ongamira ruins unveil new fantastic stories about the\
  \ last indians that prefer to commit collective suicide instead of accepting spanish\
  \ colonization, throwing themselves from the top of the tallest hill, and inspired\
  \ to the chilean poet Pablo Neruda one of his sadness visions."
