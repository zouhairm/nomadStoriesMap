Text: "We reached beautiful city of Chiang Mai early morning after long twelve hour\
  \ bus journey. It was very calm and serene morning, birds chirping, while a few\
  \ locals were giving aims to Buddhist monk. Peaceful. Jump started our day with\
  \ original Thai tea brewed at Akha Ama, one of the Chiang Mai's best cafes. We took\
  \ red-taxi service to our Airbnb rented house in a quite neighborhood near the university.\
  \ I was more focused on food trip, heard lots about Khao Soi. Come midday, it\u2019\
  s time for lunch, which in Chiang Mai, should mean at least one bowl of khao soi,\
  \ a legendary local dish of wheat noodles in a rich curry broth. Post-lunch, we\
  \ rented motorbike and rode in the windy, mountainous 15km to Doi Soithep - Chiang\
  \ Mai\u2019s most significant and impressive \u2013 religious pilgrimage, at mountaintop.\
  \ I'm from Bangkok and I don't speak Chiang Mai dialect, but it was not a problem\
  \ thankfully as their people are the best I've ever met in my lifetime. There was\
  \ a chic-styled cafe in the boundary of our house, all pink and unicorn was it's\
  \ theme named as 'Hide Garden'. In Thai when you pronounce the word 'Hide' it sounds\
  \ as 'High' - so now we know how this name originated. Mr. Champ (the owner) took\
  \ us for a ride, helped us buy some famous pickle from a local night market in the\
  \ evening. On the way back to the house, we smoked up on the hills and it was surreal.\
  \ And we are hungry again! Mr. Champ arranged a BBQ for us and some his friends,\
  \ we ate like animals and smoked like Snoop Dogg. It was a trip that I cherish the\
  \ most as I really enjoyed by the calmness of the city. Very helpful people with\
  \ no hidden agenda - case and point like Mr. Champ. We intended to make a local\
  \ connection, true, but we also experienced a leap into the unknown."
