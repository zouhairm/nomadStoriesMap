Text: "I was 9 year-old. My teacher called to my mother and said they needed to talk.\
  \ The verdict: I was a lier. The teacher started to explain to my mum that I was\
  \ inventing stories about my home town and trips I made with my family and maybe\
  \ I should go to psychologist. Big history short: everything that I was telling\
  \ to my friends were true. Each crazy story. After that I decided to write, before\
  \ I forget. \n\nThe first story that I can remember is about a trip to Atacama,\
  \ Chile. I was about 5. We were crossing the desert by car - just me, my brother\
  \ and sister, and my parents. We didn't cross nobody like 5 hours. Our car broked\
  \ and on that moment our nightmare started. \n\nNo phone's sign. No food. No water.\
  \ Nobody. In the middle or nowhere. \n\nMy family and I are very optimist in gerenal...\
  \ yeah, but not in that situation. I could see the fear through the eyes of my parents\
  \ but they tried to pretend that everything was fine. My father decided that we\
  \ should start to walk by the road and was what we did. They put some staff inside\
  \ their bags and we started.\n\nThe sun started to down and we kept walking. Silence.\
  \ To be honest, me and my siblings were easy going kids. We never complained about\
  \ stupid things and we are very close untill today. At that moment we were looking\
  \ in our eyes and without speaking we knew: we were together and supporting each\
  \ other."
