Text: "When I decided to live abroad, I thought about all the difficulties I\u2019\
  d face in there, yet my race wasn\u2019t one of them. I\u2019ve never cared much\
  \ about my identity. Since I was a child, I knew I wasn\u2019t a typical white girl,\
  \ but I wasn\u2019t a black either, I was in the middle. In Brazil, many people\
  \ are. Still, I\u2019ve never put too much thought about it.\n\nOxford is known\
  \ for being a student city and for an abroad-student, that\u2019s a dream. It\u2019\
  s small, cozy and at the same time, it\u2019s fun and agitated. There was I, in\
  \ a classroom full of other abroad-students, happy to be there and excited to get\
  \ to know them.\n\nNormally on the first day, teachers ask us to introduce ourselves.\
  \ Everybody said their name, age and country. Eventually, my turn arrived and people\
  \ gazed at me curiously and surprised with my answer. The teacher said, \"You don\u2019\
  t look like Brazilian\". I just smiled because I didn\u2019t know if that was a\
  \ good or a bad thing, but I didn\u2019t put too much thought about it.\n\nMonth\
  \ after month, I was having the time of my life. However, complicated situations\
  \ crossed my way and shacked me off like a wheel that went through a hole on the\
  \ road. I\u2019ve had always been open to talk about my culture and country. Although,\
  \ everybody seemed to be more curious to understand my appearance.\n\nIn England,\
  \ it was clear I wasn\u2019t white and if for one second I forgot, people would\
  \ remind me. It\u2019s like a rule, you have to look in a certain way if you are\
  \ from a certain place. At first, they thought I was from Turkey or Saudi Arabia,\
  \ because of my long nose and my brown skin or Polish because of my last name. When\
  \ I denied, they expected a certain explanation of why I looked the way I looked.\n\
  \nMy skin is brown. I have big lips, dark hair and eyebrows. My hair is curly, but\
  \ not too curly, a mix of curls and waves. In the beginning, I explained the colorism\
  \ in my family, but every month new people arrived at my college and the situation\
  \ reached a point where I just laughed. Comments about my body shape and race? Laugh!\
  \ I was tired. Never, in a million years, I\u2019d imagine myself justifying my\
  \ appearance because I didn\u2019t fit in their box of what a Brazilian looks like.\n\
  \nThe majority population in Brazil is black. My father is white. My mother\u2019\
  s family is black, and I was born in the middle of it, where I wasn\u2019t white\
  \ enough for the privileges and not black enough to acknowledge racism.\n\nIt had\
  \ been just like the English weather. Sometimes, I looked at the sky and I couldn\u2019\
  t figure out if it was hot or cold. I felt a mix of it, middle of both, just like\
  \ me.\n\nWalking down the English streets, I felt I wasn\u2019t the only one. Between\
  \ black and white, there were so many colors and situations that made me feel not\
  \ so alone. I saw red in the leaves in the autumn season. I lived with a woman who\
  \ chose to wear the hijab. I saw alternative kids with pink, purple and blue hair\
  \ at Camden Street. I saw the yellow flowers in flowing season. In addition, the\
  \ funniest thing, I saw half-naked people at parks trying to get the tan that I\
  \ naturally have.\n\nAs much as unpleasant some situations got, I began to realize\
  \ how powerful is to understand where you came from so you can have the knowledge\
  \ to know where to go. Furthermore, understand your family origin and your roots.\
  \ Before, I didn\u2019t put too much thought about it, but now it\u2019s all I think\
  \ of."
