Text: "Despite street signs and maps, I managed to get lost in a country where I had\
  \ little idea of how things worked. With no knowledge of the language they spoke,\
  \ I was pacing the sidewalks of the town of Salzburg, Austria, desperately trying\
  \ to find the way to the Mirabell Gardens. Salzburg being the city of music, music\
  \ reeks from every inch of it, including the most famous Mirabell Gardens, known\
  \ for the musical, The Sound of Music. With a great deal of help from the locals,\
  \ I came across an overpass. \nA symbol of love connects the banks of the Salzach.\
  \ The Love Locks bridge of Salzburg may not be one of a kind but it is one of the\
  \ heaviest I have come across, for it hold more than just the weight of the people\
  \ passing it by. It bears more than just flesh. It carries the weight of promises;\
  \ kept or unkept and love, found or lost. It is a bridge of hope and vows.\nThe\
  \ footbridge is home to hundreds and thousands of locks, studded on its sides. Each\
  \ lock harbours the name of lovers, sealing their love for eternity. Each padlock\
  \ was clasped by someone in search for eternal love and the key to the lock, tossed\
  \ into the river. On my way to the bridge I saw many shops selling engraved locks,\
  \ only to realise at the foot of the bridge the purpose of the locks. Locks of varied\
  \ shapes and sizes with different names on each one adorned the bridge, each staring\
  \ at my face with a different story to tell. \nBut to me, the bridge spoke in an\
  \ undertone of melancholy; a certain melancholy which hung in the air around me.\
  \ With initials or names scribbled in pairs, the padlocks screamed at me reinforcing\
  \ the idea that love always comes in pairs and never alone; they screamed in my\
  \ face about how love is always about finding someone that completes you and how\
  \ it is about pouring all your love into other people even when you are empty. We\
  \ are taught to love, but never ourselves.\nAnd in that moment I wished more people\
  \ wrote their own names on the locks and secured love with their own selves. I wished\
  \ more people tried to be whole before completing another soul. I wondered why we\
  \ aren\u2019t taught of self-love when some days it is just as simple as breathing.\
  \ Holding on to that thought I continued on ahead to the Mirabell Gardens."
