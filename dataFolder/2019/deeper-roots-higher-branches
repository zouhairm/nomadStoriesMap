Text: "In the late sixties, in search of a better life, my family moved to the United\
  \ States from the island of Sao Miguel of the Azores Portugal. The United States\
  \ quickly morphed my bloodline from simple farm folk to power hungry Trump supporters\
  \ with multiple cars, and businesses but little connection as a family. \nI  was\
  \ always a sensitive, deeply spiritual, nature loving artist who saw life very differently\
  \ and had often wondered how they could leave such a gorgeous lush hydrangea covered\
  \ green and blue paradise to move to the grey mound of concrete, condos, neon signs,\
  \ and littered parks of Danbury Ct. They can\u2019t help but feel restless about\
  \ my failure to adapt to a noncreative stable human existence. My lack of \u201C\
  security\u201D is terrifying to them. What terrifies me is how this American consciousness\
  \ is ripping apart our true mother, THE EARTH! Through the years I\u2019ve seen\
  \ how the forests where my imagination would run wild as a child quickly became\
  \ more condos and chain stores. \nMy grandparents are long gone but I remember relating\
  \ to the look of complete helpless non belonging that they couldn\u2019t help but\
  \ show at their attempts at adapting to a new entertainment, success, material loving\
  \  consumer world. My grandfather would play in the garden and take long walks as\
  \ he tried to grasp his place in this world, finding peace in laughing at Lucy being\
  \ ridiculous on television, not understanding anything she said, but reacting to\
  \ the art of her reactions. Thank God for the entertainment in the US, it almost\
  \ makes up for our lack of human connection, and our detachment from our true nature.\
  \ \nAfter a divorce, I spent 2017 & 2018 traveling Asia and South America feeling\
  \ a deep sense of peace at the connections I made with other expats who didn\u2019\
  t fit in to America\u2019s meterialism. \nI learned about my wings and I allowed\
  \ this flight of life to shed my old identity. I started writing a new story about\
  \ my life and fully accepting my path as a global being. But before I go further\
  \ on this path, it\u2019s time to know and understand the path of my ancestors which\
  \ got me to where my parents began my journey. \nOn April 5th I leave for Lisbon\
  \ Portugal where I will begin to see how an artist and singer can survive there.\
  \ I will get an apartment for my cat and I and I will begin to explore my heritage,\
  \ my relation to my roots and see what it would have been like to truly grow up\
  \ portuguese. How would my bloodline have been different?. Would we still condone\
  \ a president that builds walls, if we take a new bridge once in a while? It\u2019\
  s time I deepen the roots of my family tree, and allow my branches to reach higher\
  \ than our family has reached before. \nCan I reconnect to my people? Can I use\
  \ that connection to help heal the damage America has done to the consciousness\
  \ of my family? \nWatch me try!"
