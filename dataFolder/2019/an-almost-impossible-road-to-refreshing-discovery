Text: "I was startled out of deep sleep by the sound of crying babies, bleating goats\
  \ and sheep and mooing cows. I listened out for human voices, but even the adults\
  \ talking outside my room were using a language I could not understand at all. \n\
  Time check? 7am. I had slept for barely four hours, having arrived in Abim district\
  \ at the ungodly hour of 3am, after a gruelling 16-hour journey from Uganda\u2019\
  s capital Kampala. Abim is found 412 kilometres to the north-east of Uganda, a remote,\
  \ semi-arid region whose mostly livestock farming population still uses the nomadic\
  \ style of animal rearing.\nAlthough my muscles were aching, eyes drowsy and head\
  \ pounding, I immediately I loved the pure smell of my new surroundings. The little\
  \ room at Follam Motel that I shared with my fianc\xE9 smelt of soaked dust. A cold\
  \ and damp air lurked around the room.\nI decided to take a shower and get some\
  \ breakfast, as I was starving. In the bathroom, I discovered that the fresh, earthy\
  \ smell came from the water, which was murky. While I loved that smell, the thought\
  \ of bathing with water brown in colour, let alone bone-chilling cold, made me think\
  \ twice. But I didn\u2019t have any options, and so I took a quick shower anyway.\n\
  Welcome to life in arguably the most far-flung stretch of rural Uganda.\nUganda\
  \ is a small country with an area of only 241,037 square kilometres, or nearly the\
  \ same land mass as the United Kingdom and a little over two-and-a-half times the\
  \ size of Portugal. Therefore, one would expect that we know most, if not all, of\
  \ its corners. The reality, though, is totally different. \nYou see, we only travel\
  \ when we must because it\u2019s a luxury. Most roads are poor and air transport\
  \ is non-existent. Yet each time we travel, we are exposed to nature at its most\
  \ beautiful and experiences from which one can weave stories till the cows come\
  \ home. \nWhen we set out from Kampala on our way to a friend\u2019s sister\u2019\
  s wedding, I never imaged that the journey would be that arduous. At the onset,\
  \ we drove on fairly good roads and enjoyed an unforgettable break at Namawojolo,\
  \ a roadside town an hour away from Kampala that is famous for its charcoal-stove\
  \ baked chicken, beef and gonja (plantain). \nIf only I knew what lay ahead, I would\
  \ have stocked enough chicken and gonja to carry me through what turned out to be\
  \ a nearly two-day journey. \nFor the better part of the journey, our travel party\
  \ of animated travellers exchanged comical childhood stories that had us all shrieking\
  \ with laughter. It helped the mood that the road was smooth for the first five\
  \ hours or so. \nHowever, as we approached Kumi district, some 250 kilometres from\
  \ Kampala, the sun retreated beyond the horizon, the road began to run out of smooth\
  \ tarmac, and the passengers began to bounce from their seats to nearly the roof\
  \ of the car with each pothole that the driver hit.\nOur driver, Brian, who was\
  \ the bride\u2019s brother, continued to drive at amateur rally driver pace despite\
  \ the bumpy road. It was scary. But he stocked our fears further when he said the\
  \ remaining 123-kilometre stretch used to be a haunt for raids by armed cattle-rustling\
  \ Karimojong warriors. He said it was the norm for drivers to race at break-neck\
  \ speed either to dodge gunshots or send the warriors fleeing from the road. \n\
  By the time we arrived in Abim, I was too tired to care for anything but sleep.\
  \ Immediately we were booked into our room at Follam motel, I fell into the kind\
  \ of deep sleep only a totally knackered person can reach \u2013 until I was startled\
  \ out of my slumber by the cacophony of sounds outside my room and the smell of\
  \ earthy water inside.\nWhen I stepped outside my room, I was blown away by what\
  \ I saw.  Surrounding the modest dusty town with one unpaved street were rocky hills\
  \ of nearly equal height but green to the top. It was like waking up inside a dormant,\
  \ well-manicured crater in the middle of a whole new world."
