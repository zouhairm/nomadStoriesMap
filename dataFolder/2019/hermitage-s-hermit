Text: "It was the day before Victory Day, but I was already defeated and Goya was\
  \ the one to blame. \n\nMy heartbeats were accelerated inside the heart of Saint\
  \ Petersburg in Russia. The Hermitage is the second-largest museum in the world,\
  \ with over 3 million artworks from all over the globe and a lot of gold.  The czars\
  \ really liked to sleep in fortune, I suppose.\n\nAlthough it was all beautiful\
  \ and thoughtful, my heart wasn\u2019t skipping a beat for that, but because I had\
  \ to run everywhere to keep up with my guide and our little tourism group: a party\
  \ of nine, including us both.  Anastasiya - the guide - was young, blonde and lovely,\
  \ but a really fast talker.  The group had to pick between paying attention on her\
  \ and contemplating the pieces on its own pace.\n\nEventually, Anastasiya would\
  \ glance at her watch and speed up even more. She was tiny, mingling among the super\
  \ crowded museum and the group had to interrupt whatever they were doing to catch\
  \ her up in another spot, where she would have already started to explain about\
  \ something else.  \n\nHistory, art, painters gossips, it was all embraced in her\
  \ lectures.  It would be a master class if we could hear it all (in chronological\
  \ order, please) instead of just random fragments to be put together later in an\
  \ impossible puzzle. \n\nAt one point, I was getting so confused listening about\
  \ Rasputin while looking at a Degas painting that I kind of gave up. Next thing\
  \ I knew, I was just following her, ignoring most of the masterpieces I came across.\
  \ To be honest, I could easily space out from her talking too. And then, passing\
  \ by an exotic picture, I read with the corner of my eye that it belonged to Goya.\
  \ \n\nI didn\u2019t know anything about him, except that he was a famous painter\
  \ from who knows where. On the other hand, I loved Serge Gainsbourg enough to care\
  \ about Goya just because he did. So I quickly stopped right there, took a two-second\
  \ selfie with it, turned around and Anastasiya was gone.\n\nI often avoid guides\
  \ in my trips, but I was under special circumstances.  My stay in Russia was just\
  \ for two days in a sort of transit between Finland and the triad Lithuania, Latvia\
  \ and Estonia - countries that were visa free for me, while it was required  a Russian\
  \ visa to spend the day there and I didn\u2019t have one. Plus I had no time to\
  \ provide one myself, but if visiting Russia with a guide, I could get a special\
  \ visa for this purpose only and she would be the one to deal with the beaurocratic\
  \ issues. A pretty good deal.\n\nAt first, I looked around the museum playing cool,\
  \ but couldn\u2019t spot them anywhere. I tried to relax and it suddenly hit me\
  \ \u201Cmy God, she has my passport\u201D.  I froze.  I never entrust my passport\
  \ to someone else, but again, this case was an exception as a whole. \n\nAlso, I\
  \ don\u2019t mind getting lost abroad. I understand that\u2019s part of the exploring\
  \ experience and I always find my way. But without my passport? That was my worst\
  \ nightmare.\n\nI wandered asking other guides if they knew Anastasiya and I whistled\
  \ to the song from the movie Anastasia. After that, I started singing the blues\
  \ - in the figurative way, when depression got me, wondering if it would be a shame\
  \ to cry.  I even dramatically came up with this thought of how miserable my new\
  \ life would be if I had to hide myself in the secret parts of the museum as a hermit\
  \ in order to have a house to live.\n\nFinally, I tried to search in a different\
  \ place:  outside.  I crossed one of the Hermitage exit doors and there was Anastasiya,\
  \ under the zero degrees Celsius weather in her blue skirt and thin coat, telling\
  \ the group how glad she was that it was a sunny day in that 7th of May, so we could\
  \ see that Russia wasn\u2019t always cold.  I agreed with a smile, but my chattering\
  \ teeth didn\u2019t."
