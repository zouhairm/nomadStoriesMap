Text: "Standing at a busy local Sri Lankan bus station, caught unprepared given the\
  \ looming position of the front facing sun, waiting for an already late bus to hopefully\
  \ arrive, I wonder how much longer my body will physically allow me to wait in this\
  \ heat. No shade available if I want to keep an eye on the bus stop, sweat starts\
  \ to trickle down the backs of my knees. The locals all stand sheltered by the umbrellas\
  \ they were prepared enough to bring out with them to the bus stop today. I begin\
  \ to feel doubly hot from the embarrassment of judging this situation so casually.\
  \ Maybe the bus won\u2019t show at all, how long could I wait in this heat? Maybe\
  \ I\u2019d have to just give up on my plans for a trip to the coast.\n\nA local\
  \ lady around-about my age edges closer, at first just from the corner of my eye\
  \ I see her. Without saying anything at all, she stands just close enough to me,\
  \ and at the exact right angle, that her umbrella lends its shade to my hot little\
  \ head. At first, I don\u2019t want to look at her, acknowledge her act \u2013 is\
  \ this what she really intends on doing? And why? She\u2019s close enough now that\
  \ the arm she\u2019s holding the umbrella with is brushing mine on her inhales.\
  \ This can\u2019t be accidental; I look at her and mouth \u2018thank-you\u2019.\
  \ At that moment I feel I could wait for two more days right there in the hot dust\
  \ for that bus. Hers arrives, and one minute later, so does mine.\n\nMy point from\
  \ this story? That naturally, inherently, people ARE kind. Don\u2019t get me wrong,\
  \ I\u2019ve had my fair experiences with rude and unkindly behaved people (locals\
  \ and tourists alike) But via travelling, and perhaps fearing the opposite to be\
  \ true, I\u2019ve been met mostly by humanKIND, so much so that sometimes it\u2019\
  s left me in actual amazement.\n\nI have so many versions of the umbrella story\
  \ that I\u2019ve encountered flying solo\u2026"
