Text: Basically I am from India ... But we do have 29 states and all states with different
  cultures, different people's and so on. Like if u r in Kolkata u will find people
  from traditional kind of things and if u go to pondichury many people r from french.
  So I was there in pondichury and I was so happy to be there. The food was amazing,
  people were amazing though they do not speak English much but yes can understand
  and mostly the view the roads, everything. It was really very grateful to be there.
  I wish I could live Little longer there my room was Sea view roads were like u have
  travelled into time and it was something which can't be written. The buildings were
  mostly like french colony, even they named it as white town it was really amazing.
  I want to tell you that I work as a hotelier and I travel from place to place but
  never went out of country I would like to go out of country if u give me a chance
  I would take this and do visit Portugal because I have heard it's a great place
  and by the way of my favorite footballer lives there CR7  it would be great if I
  can visit this country.
