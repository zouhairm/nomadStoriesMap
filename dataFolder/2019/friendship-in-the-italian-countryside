Text: "When I was twelve I went to summer camp in Italy.  \n\nIn the depths of the\
  \ Tuscan hills, I shot arrows into a forest, ate ravoli off a ceramic plate with\
  \ real silverware at a picnic table, and sat on a stone wall eating ice cream.\n\
  \nBut what I remember most was the friend I made. Francesca. She was Caucasian,\
  \ with long, mostly straight dark hair she always wore in two braids.\n\nI still\
  \ have the photos we took of each other in the changing rooms \u2013 sage blue tiles\
  \ in a diamond pattern, metal hooks, wooden benches. In the photos we\u2019re wearing\
  \ tee shirts and shorts. Her hair is in its braids and mine is a curly cloud, pinned\
  \ back with a lavender bandana in a style I only use at the busiest times and never\
  \ in public over a decade later.\n\nWe talked for hours. We knew about each other\u2019\
  s families, about our interests, about our fellow campers and the counselors. Or\
  \ we sat quietly and that was good too. \n\nThe heat was terrible that summer. In\
  \ the city, walking around, it felt like one was melting. I poured tiny amounts\
  \ of bottled water over my head before taking a gulp every afternoon when my parents\
  \ picked me up. The countryside felt like another world. A place where the shade\
  \ wasn\u2019t a miracle and campers screamed and called to each other. It was still\
  \ hot, but the heat didn\u2019t permeate everything. There was water and ice cream\
  \ to cool us down.\n\nWe shivered in a pool that felt like ice, but we retreated\
  \ to the shade as soon as we got out and I twisted my hair into a bun to preserve\
  \ the cooling properties of wet hair. \n\nWe laughed off our failure at archery\
  \ \u2013 neither of us hit the target. As the counselor said: \u201CYou two would\
  \ be great if the aim was to hit the bushes behind the fence.\u201D Needless to\
  \ say, neither of us beat Silvio, who had an innate talent for everything even slightly\
  \ athletic and to annoy the counselors with his disregard for the camp rule of using\
  \ English when asking questions. \n\nHe had me in stitches half the time, though\
  \ I understood the gist. It was thanks to Francesca that I had any specifics. Francesca\
  \ and I communicated almost exclusively in English. It was the point of the camp\
  \ after all: for Italian kids to learn English. As an American, I was the star of\
  \ the camp, and learned basic Italian instead. \n\nI may have lost touch with Francesca,\
  \ but it is the long chats about the animals that would make their houses from our\
  \ arrows, the way I ate better at camp than some of the meals with my parents, the\
  \ way Silvio and I communicated in looks and gestures, the laughter when my Spanish\
  \ pronunciation warped my Italian. \n\nWhen I close my eyes, that is the summer\
  \ I can see. It is not the walks through the heat of Florence or Rome. It is the\
  \ images from there. It is a red brick building and an unheated swimming pool. It\
  \ is slopes of sand and grass. It is the water slide and the picnic table under\
  \ the tarp. It is ice cream melting before I can eat it. And it is the rhythm of\
  \ the language lulling me to sleep through the open windows."
