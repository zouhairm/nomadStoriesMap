Text: "The landscape shifts indistinctively as the train approaches Vienna. I have\
  \ been glued to this chair with random thoughts for too long. I am not hungry or\
  \ tired, nor am I in the mood for a cigarette or my book. I will go do the interview\
  \ and return in time for a pleasantly uneventful weekend in my charming Bremen suburb\
  \ I love.\nThe biting wind pierces through and I forget to smoke when I make my\
  \ way into the taxi and then the hotel room. It\u2019s slightly overheated and comfortable\
  \ and there\u2019ll be a decent breakfast tomorrow before the interview and that\u2019\
  s that.\nI find myself with plenty of time to kill as I\u2019m still puzzled at\
  \ how remarkably smooth and short the talks were. A numb indifference at the outcome\
  \ leaves me wondering whether I should bother to go for more than the quick tour,\
  \ a coffee, and a schnitzel. \n\u201CThere\u2019s a tram leaving soon and I\u2019\
  m supposed to show you around,\u201D he says as he joins me outside, in the clean\
  \ silence of the Viennese afternoon. \nThe hushed tones and respectful distances\
  \ make me almost uncomfortable. \u201CThe entire city feels like a damn library\u201D\
  \ he smiles warmly, while black curls frame the sincerest hazel eyes. \nThere\u2019\
  s that and then the airy grandeur of the Ring Strasse. Paris and London are incomprehensible\
  \ for the visitor because of their mere size, while Florence and Venice arouse a\
  \ museum-like claustrophobia. It just happens that they got the sizes right in Vienna,\
  \ so it\u2019s all becoming real by the time we passed the elegant monotones of\
  \ the State Opera and reached the Heroes\u2019 Esplanade. Frozen alongside two equestrian\
  \ statues, the wide square is rather intimidating, with echoes of the long-gone\
  \ imperial past and not so distant Anschluss reverberating through. \nMy guide mentions\
  \ there\u2019s an ice rink in front of the Town Hall that reminds him of Harry Potter,\
  \ but I\u2019d like to stick with the quick tour and reality for a second longer\
  \ and walk through to the pedestrian area. There\u2019s a free organ concert in\
  \ one of the churches, a vendor with roasted chestnuts and mulled wine, people in\
  \ suits enjoying their Viennese sausages at a street stand, families on their evening\
  \ walk, and a charming sarcastic aloofness to the waiter that serves us coffee.\
  \ \nOutside I can hear the sound of my own steps in the hopeful spring breeze as\
  \ I walk in the tracks of Mozart and Beethoven played by a flute on Graben and a\
  \ blind tenor on Saint Stephen\u2019s Square. \n\u201CI need to keep one euro for\
  \ the music in my pocket,\u201D I tell myself and I\u2019m startled at the natural\
  \ flow of the thought - I don\u2019t even live here. Yet. Maybe? \nMy host is affable\
  \ and friendly and while I\u2019m normally not the social type, his chit chat does\
  \ not obscure my train of thought. I\u2019m rather more anchored to myself as we\
  \ converse along; alive and a tad drunk on the sentiment is how I feel and ice skating\
  \ does not sound like a bad idea. \nDinner is at a French bistro where the chef\
  \ is Greek and the waiter Canadian and we discuss Turkish foreign policy with a\
  \ few of his friends while savoring grilled goat cheese salads, mussels, and a white\
  \ Bordeaux. \nThere\u2019s going to be brunch at a newly open Levantine on Sunday\
  \ and a jazz evening tomorrow, and maybe they\u2019ll take me for a walk in the\
  \ Prater or the Sch\xF6nbrunn gardens, depending on the weather. I don\u2019t remember\
  \ having agreed to any of this, but I don\u2019t question it either since it\u2019\
  s real and right and I haven\u2019t touched a cigarette in more than 24 hours. \n\
  It seems rather fitting to end the day with cocktails at the Museum of Contemporary\
  \ Art on the way back to the hotel while, strangely, my only concern is to wake\
  \ up in time to wave my train goodbye in the morning."
