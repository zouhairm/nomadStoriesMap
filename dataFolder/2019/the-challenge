Text: "I was teach to find a career, get stabilised, get married and have family,\
  \ all before the 30s, most of my friends or family have already done those options...\
  \ not me...\n\nThat wasn\u2019t me, I decided to prove myself, beyond my comfort\
  \ zone. I wanted to leave, I wanted to live. Get out of my desk and my place and\
  \ find something new, to put my roots on.\n\nAll of that happen in one year (my\
  \ parents moved to another city, my brother got married, most of my friends had\
  \ kids or got engaged, I felt that every single person that surrounded me was successful\
  \ and fulfilling their dreams, except me), so I have to start to think and start\
  \ to follow my dreams... somewhere...\n\n I was determined to go to Europe (dream\
  \ child)  and meet new cultures and people, when I got the ticket I was afraid and\
  \ happy. I heard that fear makes us know that we are not stupid. \nWhen the day\
  \ come, I was so excited in the plane that nothing could blur that feeling, nor\
  \ the 17 hours without sleep, or the lack of knowledge about french, or the fb friendship\
  \ that gave me roof and bed to sleep.\nI definitely will do it again.\n\nNext day\
  \ I went to the city, jet lag was there but I didn\u2019t pay attention to it.\n\
  \n Paris seemed very far and exciting for someone in South America, and it didn\u2019\
  t disappointed me. Everything was just perfect, astonishingly new and old at the\
  \ same time, hearing different languages and see different people with \u201Cnot\
  \ common\u201D clothing and hair styling... and no one stared to them... gosh everything\
  \ I read before about this continent was completely true! \n\nI didn\u2019t listen\
  \ to music the whole day because hearing people was everything I wanted to do! \n\
  \nMy hostess was really afraid of me getting lost, I actually did but I was so marvelled\
  \ by the city that I wasn\u2019t aware that I was lost.\nWalking, wondering around,\
  \ thinking, everything by my own. \n\nAll the \u201Care you sure?\u201D \u201CYou\u2019\
  ll never be able to do that\u201D \u201Cthat\u2019s a crazy stuff girl\u201D \u201C\
  what about the language\u201D all of that stayed at the airport in chile, and I\
  \ was alone and powerful. Because I trusted in myself and I just let my inner child\
  \ to enjoy little things with my outsider adult taking care of her..."
