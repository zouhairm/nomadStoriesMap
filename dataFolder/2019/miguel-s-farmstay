Text: "We are sitting on Miguel\u2019s porch, rocking gently in sea-glass green adirondack\
  \ chairs, both laughing as I try to coax out of him the snippets of poetry, scripture,\
  \ and sayings he\u2019s peppered me with the past few days. There\u2019s a break\
  \ in the weather - a glimpse of blue sky between downpours - and I want to make\
  \ sure I input all of these modismos into my tattered travel notebook before we\
  \ head off.  Miguel and I are firmly established amigos at this point, our bond\
  \ sealed by a mutual love of the Cuban folksinger Silvio Rodriguez, so my stomach\
  \ sinks when he says it.\n\n\u201CWhen you first arrived, I didn\u2019t think you\
  \ were going to stay.\u201D\n\nMiguel\u2019s was the only homestay we booked in\
  \ advance. I had decided that I wanted to stay on a farm in Cuba, and a Google search\
  \ led me to a blog post. The German couple that stayed with Miguel raved about the\
  \ \u201Clocal produce\u201D that \u201CEl Permacultor\u201D grew on his organic\
  \ farmstead. Hoping for mangoes and coconuts, I booked two nights. \n\nVi\xF1ales\
  \ is a town of brilliantly painted bungalows, tours advertising tobacco and rum,\
  \ and a landscape that alternates between iron-rich red and rainforest green. We\
  \ arrived on bicycles, the rust-colored roads running with rain. I shielded my iPhone\
  \ to follow the directions on the screenshot I had taken before we left. Not only\
  \ did we not have access to the Internet, our offline maps had frozen when we took\
  \ a boat tour to a small island the day before. The captain told us that Cubans\
  \ weren\u2019t allowed on the tour, or boats at all for that matter, and our disbelief\
  \ convinced us that was why our map stopped working.\n\nBut we arrived at Miguel\u2019\
  s, easily. I was just sure it wasn\u2019t actually the right place. It was a house,\
  \ with a house on either side, and houses on either side of those. A creek, swollen\
  \ with rain, gushed in front. Not a papaya tree or pig pen in sight. I knocked.\
  \ I could at least ask where Miguel lived. \n\nHis wife answered the door. She smiled\
  \ gently, yes, this is Miguel\u2019s place. Please come in. She motioned to our\
  \ room, which looked like others we\u2019d rented in Cuba: obsessively clean and\
  \ painfully pink. I tried to explain that we thought this was a farmstay, but she\
  \ looked at me blankly. We reluctantly wheeled our bikes in. \n\nTwenty-four hours\
  \ of rain, crossword puzzles, and card games later, Miguel passed by our room in\
  \ an army-green rain slicker, carrying a bucket of food scraps. I practically pounced\
  \ on him. \n\n\u201CA d\xF3nde vas?\u201D \n\nTo feed the pigs.\n\nCan we come?\
  \ \n\nMinutes later, we were splashing through the sodden outskirts of Vi\xF1ales,\
  \ Miguel recounting his history in the tobacco town. When we arrived at the farm\
  \ there were fruit trees, and a pig pen, and flowering vines embraced everything\
  \ in a giant tangle. Miguel crouched down and plucked a cashew from the messy understory.\
  \ A math teacher for 40 years, he was retiring in May. Studying permaculture was\
  \ part of his retirement plan: he hoped to clean up the old house on the property\
  \ and turn it into an education center.\n\nIn the rain, there wasn\u2019t much to\
  \ see or do on the farm, so after Miguel fed the pigs, we loaded our pockets with\
  \ mangoes and headed home. Because we were interested, Miguel kept talking. How\
  \ could you ever run out of questions about Cuba?\n\nAs we were walking back to\
  \ his house, I remembered something: Silvio Rodriguez, the Cuban singer-songwriter\
  \ I had been introduced to in Chile 17 years earlier. \n\n\u201CMiguel,\u201D I\
  \ asked. \u201CDo you happen to like Silvio Rodriguez?\u201D \n\nHis already globe-like\
  \ eyes widened. Silvio, he said, was his idol. His muse. His favorite. \n\nWe sang\
  \ every Silvio song I could remember. They say that when you sing you can\u2019\
  t think about anything else, but my mind was reeling. I\u2019m in Cuba. Singing\
  \ in Spanish. As I walk down the street with my homestay host. I will never forget\
  \ this. When Miguel looked at me, I knew he couldn\u2019t believe it, either. \n\
  \nFarm or no farm, I\u2019m so glad that I stayed."
