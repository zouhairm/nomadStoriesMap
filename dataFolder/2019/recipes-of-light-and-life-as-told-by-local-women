Text: "I arrived at Dubai with an image in my mind portrayed by what I see in the\
  \ media. Huge skyscrapers, clean streets, people from different nationalities celebrating\
  \ life in every single way. Since I was not that kind of a person who chases luxury,\
  \ I decided to look for the untold stories in the backstreets of this so \"shining\"\
  \ city. I don't want to criticize it, but Dubai reminds me of Cairo, both have always\
  \ fascinated me in the many layers they have. These possibilities to alternative\
  \ narrative have triggered my curiosity to connect with people as humans not as\
  \ images in the catalog of the travel agency.\n\nI have no previous idea how Emirati\
  \ women would look for about their future or think about life in general. It happened\
  \ that my colleague at work, while we were wasting time at the women room, asked\
  \ me if I knew Nawak El Saadawi. Nawal is a very famous doctor and writer in feminism.\
  \ When I started quoting my favorite reading, my colleagues' eyes get wide open.\
  \ Since that time we kept on not only exploring reading in depth, but she showed\
  \ the intimate world of women there. She invited me to spend a weekend with her\
  \ grandmother who taught me how to catch a fish with my bare hands. I learnt about\
  \ the struggles of being a \"local\" woman as she is not allowed to appear in the\
  \ local custom at any of the bars, for instance.\nIt happened that my neighbors\
  \ at the hotel where I chose, based on my limited budget that doesn't match the\
  \ slogan of the city to be just only for the rich, were a group of women in the\
  \ middle of their twenties who came to earn money as sex workers. I never felt myself\
  \ the need to judge them or label what they do. Frankly speaking, I always wondered\
  \ how they spend their days. Many times, I met some two of them in the elevator\
  \ early in the morning where they have to go out for bringing food wearing sports\
  \ and no make-up at all. I felt that there is always a layer of the naked truth;\
  \ one can't reach by accepting the ready-made images. I couldn't find a chance to\
  \ fully feed my curiosity except for knowing new genres of music always played from\
  \ their countries.\n\nI remember that one day I came back and found candles all\
  \ over the stairs to my other neighbor apartment. First I was afraid of all these\
  \ candles might cause a fire, then the Indian wife living next door told me that\
  \ they are celebrating Diwali. I think it is a religious occasion where it is prayed\
  \ to bring light to the world. It was an \"aha\" moment for someone like me who\
  \ has been raised to be Muslim. I never experienced any celebration of different\
  \ religious occasions. I might have a glimpse of thought via reading or watching\
  \ movies, but not that intimate. My neighbor invited me to have their special \"\
  Corma\" a very spicy chicken with coconut milk. I learned from my neighbor why it\
  \ is important to keep her naval undressed. It is believed that this is the \"eye\"\
  , the spiritual gate where the soul navigates and connects to the light of the world.\
  \ I asked to wear an Indian Sari, and she promised me to bring one next visit. I\
  \ have to admit that it wasn't only the food that stirred my soul, it was the intimacy\
  \ and the moment when I realized that human being are so connected in food and their\
  \ search for spiritual light. \n\nWhen I planned for my journey, I thought that\
  \ I am following the call of my career, yet what I saw, lived, internalized into\
  \ my bones have shown me a new lesson that life has many narratives and it is always\
  \ interesting how women narrate their stories, not only in words but also in providing\
  \ real examples of searching, being and thriving for life."
