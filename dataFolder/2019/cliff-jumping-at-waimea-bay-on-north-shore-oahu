Text: "Drive an hour northward from downtown Honolulu and you will find yourself in\
  \ Waimea Bay Beach Park on the North Shore Oahu. With crystal-clear aquamarine waters,\
  \ ocean cliffs (approx. 10 meters in height), calm ocean surface, and powdery white\
  \ sand, Waimea Bay a perfect spot to try cliff jumping in the summer. For those\
  \ who are first-time cliff jumpers, you might stand atop the cliff for hours long\
  \ shaking. However, once you are ready to jump, it simply takes an infinitesimal\
  \ moment to get back to your comfort zone again.\n\nIt took me half hour to suck\
  \ up my fear of heights and decide to walk towards the \u2018point of no return\u2019\
  . Here is an implied rule: once you set your feet on the cliff, there is only one\
  \ way to return to the shore \u2013 jump.  Walking back from the cliff is absolutely\
  \ a no-go and you will be ridiculed.\n\nI slowly walked up to the peak with my bare\
  \ feet, secured my bikini (you might have your top slip away after the drop), and\
  \ trembled towards the edge. Walking along the cliff is fairly easy. The rock surface\
  \ is a tad jagged but smooth to walk on with my bare feet.  Even though I was scared\
  \ to death, I did not stumble, slip or scrape myself.\n\nThe diving crowd started\
  \ expanding and I said some words of encouragement to myself as I approaching the\
  \ edge. I tried striking conversations with several other first time jumpers and\
  \ allowed myself time to enjoy the pristine beauty of the bay so I would eventually\
  \ become distracted and let go of my fear. A half hour passed, I saw people passing\
  \ by, one after another; they stood on the top, got ready and jump, and then came\
  \ up and went jumping again. Their poses vary \u2013 some dipped themselves straight\
  \ into the ocean, while some tried flying while jumping. There were also pro divers\
  \ who turned somersaults\u2026and I could exactly hear my heartbeat.\n\nA girl was\
  \ standing behind me and I noticed that she had jumped many times already. There\
  \ she was, coming up again and excited to jump. Suddenly, I was reminded of a diving\
  \ scene on one of my favorite TV shows One Tree Hill, where Sarah first met her\
  \ husband when jumping the bridge. Maybe I need a little push and mental encouragement\
  \ like that, or worse, a jumping partner. So, here is how I jumped:\n\nI looked\
  \ back and asked that girl I barely knew:\n\n\u201CDo you want to jump together?\n\
  \n\u201CSure\u201D, she agreed without any hesitation.\n\nThen she held my left\
  \ hand, we approached the edge, and began the countdown \u2013 three, two, one\u2026\
  \ the free fall starts, but just for a few seconds. We took a deep breath and allowed\
  \ the warm water to wash over us. We dropped into the ocean and I was still alive!\
  \ I felt a great sense of accomplishment. Having just completed my first dive, I\
  \ hurried to go back on the cliff and was ready to embark on more jumps."
