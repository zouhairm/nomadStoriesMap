Text: "\u201CWe are not terrorists. I hope you can let the world know once you return\
  \ to your countries,\u201D the father of the bride took over the microphone and\
  \ spoke to our group in his native northern Pashto dialect. The Afghani wedding\
  \ in that remote village of Shughnon was about to bring a whirlwind of change to\
  \ my perception of war-torn nations and their communities.\n\nJust as swiftly as\
  \ we had polished off the rich aromatic Afghani pulao and dried mulberries off the\
  \ aluminum plate in front of us, the bride\u2019s father had made his plea for recognition\
  \ and passed on a responsibility of sorts to our small group of unsuspecting wedding\
  \ guests.\n\nMy friends and I had signed up for this 2-day experiential trip to\
  \ one of the most remote parts of north-eastern Afghanistan. We had boarded an Mi8\
  \ helicopter from Dushanbe, the capital of Tajikistan, to get to the border town\
  \ of Khorog. Following a scurried visa application process and a 2-hour wait at\
  \ the Afghanistan consulate in Khorog, we received our visas to cross over my first\
  \ river border, into Afghanistan.\n\nOur anxiousness and excitement was met in equal\
  \ proportions with a rigorous baggage check from the Afghani border police, armed\
  \ with their AK47\u2019s and sinister smiles. Almost as though they were enjoying\
  \ the routine at our expense.\n\nA voice in my head screamed, \u201CIt\u2019s not\
  \ too late. You don\u2019t have to do this. You can still turn around and run back\
  \ to safety.\u201D Right then, our Tajik guide waved goodbye and asked us to look\
  \ out for Masad, our Afghani host on the other side of the bridge. \u201CYou\u2019\
  ll be safe. Have fun,\u201D he said, sensing the tension in the group.\n\nMasad,\
  \ a silhouette in a black pathani, stood tall behind a cloud of dust and apprehension.\
  \ He greeted us with a warm handshake and an affectionate smile, putting our doubts\
  \ to rest. We hopped aboard his rickety minibus that meandered through the village,\
  \ crossing a wedding procession at first, followed by a herd of sheep making its\
  \ way to the grazing fields.\n\nWe stopped by a serene outhouse built on the banks\
  \ of the river that formed a natural border between Afghanistan and Tajikistan.\
  \ \u201CMany have attempted to swim to the other side, but the currents are too\
  \ strong,\u201D chirped Maria, Masad\u2019s sister and co-host. Wrapped in warm\
  \ blankets, we soaked in the serenity of the open fields and rolling hills in front\
  \ of us as we started to get comfortable with our surroundings.\n\nDelicious home-cooked\
  \ meals and freshly picked apricots over the course of our stay at Masad\u2019s\
  \ family home filled our bellies and hearts with fondness and affection. The women\
  \ of the house conversed with us in broken English. The spirited young Maria, on\
  \ the other hand, spoke flawlessly and flaunted it just the same. This was her last\
  \ week at home. She was leaving for Dushanbe for a year to pursue her Masters degree\
  \ in psychology.\n\nThe night was spent dancing away to the tunes of local musicians\
  \ who Masad invited over to entertain the crowds. Neighbours flocked in. Young boys\
  \ and girls chatted away, throwing glances in our direction and giggling as our\
  \ eyes caught theirs. We were exhausted but happy. Content but sad that this would\
  \ all be over too soon.\n\nAfter a sumptuous breakfast and a bumpy bus ride, we\
  \ arrived at the wedding where the bride\u2019s father was pouring his heart out\
  \ to us. Masad continued translating, \u201CWe are a peace loving community and\
  \ we respect our women, educate our girls and work hard to make an honest living.\
  \ We can\u2019t be grateful enough that you decided to visit us.\u201D Tears rolled\
  \ down my cheeks. An overwhelming sense of gratitude and hopelessness engulfed me.\
  \ I was thankful for the experiences we had had over the past two days. An entire\
  \ village had come together to extend their love, warmth and hospitality, walking\
  \ us through fields, taking us around the bazaars and entertaining us with their\
  \ tales.\n\nJust like that, life would go back to normal for some of us, while the\
  \ Taliban forces would continue their insurgencies not too far from this happy village,\
  \ posing a looming  threat everyday."
