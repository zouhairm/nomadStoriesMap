Text: "It's the gateway to holiday heaven, but Brisbane has its own charms, writes\
  \ Olivia Fairhurst.\n\nWith the Sunshine Coast and Gold Coast at arms' reach, Brisbane\
  \ is often overlooked when it comes to holidaying. But I explored the city and found\
  \ it delivers ample choices for visitors.\n\nThink: high-rise buildings providing\
  \ dinners overlooking the river, leisurely bike rides, garden walks, manmade beaches,\
  \ island retreats, hot air balloon rides and Italian architecture. Why travel halfway\
  \ around the world when Brisbane is right in our backyard?\n\nAs we sit down to\
  \ lunch, the Story Bridge takes pride and place as our view. The river flows beneath,\
  \ carrying kayakers and the CityHopper, a free inner-city ferry service. Yeah, you\
  \ got that right, free.\n\nDining at the Alchemy Restaurant, my choice is the Gold\
  \ Coast King Prawns with garlic and pernod butter followed by an irresistible risotto.\
  \ The service is impeccable. A first taste of the food and hospitality Brisbane\
  \ has to offer.\n\nNext, an afternoon with Hop On Brewery Tours and who better to\
  \ guide it than a Portland, Oregon expat?\n\nShe's also a self-confessed history\
  \ nerd, and promises this brewery tour isn't just going to be about just tasting\
  \ beer.\n\nWe start at Newstead Brewery, in an original 1940s steel warehouse with\
  \ beamed ceilings. There's a warm yeasty smell in the air \u2014 unusual, yet comforting\
  \ \u2014 like a mulled wine at a winter German market.\n\nWe're handed a taster\
  \ to sip on as the brewer gives us a personal tour, running through the different\
  \ procedures. And as we sit down, six more tastings of beers with varying smoky,\
  \ sweet and sour notes are placed in front of us. The tour guide gives endless knowledge\
  \ on the production, culture and history behind each and every beer.\n\nBut it's\
  \ a famous Brisbane story behind The Mayne Thing golden lager's branding \u2014\
  \ a butcher's meat cleaver \u2014 that catches my attention. Our guide tells us\
  \ that in 1848, a sawyer was robbed and murdered. The following year Brisbane man\
  \ Patrick Mayne bought a butcher's store with what he claimed was funds from his\
  \ small wage as a labourer. Others believed it actually came from the money Mayne\
  \ stole when he committed the murder.\n\nEither way, this was the beginning of his\
  \ business ventures and he became one of the wealthiest men in Brisbane. It's said\
  \ on his death bed in 1865, Mayne also confessed to the murder of a priest. His\
  \ widow believed insanity ran in the family and banned their five children from\
  \ having children.\n\nThe family's inheritance funded the site of the University\
  \ of Queensland and the estate's income is still contributing to the medical school\
  \ there.\n\nIf you love Italian food or a meal with a view, the riverside Persone\
  \ restaurant will blow you away. From its second-floor location you can see the\
  \ city lights reflecting onto the water and Brisbane's version of the London Eye,\
  \ setting the perfect dining atmosphere. There's glamorous modernised 60s decor,\
  \ with plush teal velvet seating.\n\nWe sit in front of the floor-to-ceiling window\
  \ and I order the arancini balls \u2014 the crispy-coated fontina cheese-infused\
  \ rice spheres drizzled in a ragu sauce certainly do not disappoint.\n\nRaviolo\
  \ d'agnello with spring lamb and a butter sage sauce is new to me, but the butter\
  \ and sage brings out the flavour of the exquisite lamb and pasta. Baby carrots\
  \ glazed with honey, goats yoghurt and hazelnuts have the perfect amount of sweetness\
  \ and crunch.\n\nThe mains sit at around $30, offering fine dining at a reasonable\
  \ price. It would be the perfect restaurant to end the holiday on a high, and is\
  \ certainly the nicest Italian food I've tasted outside Italy.\n\nThe following\
  \ morning, with the sun blazing, we hire bikes and take a relaxed ride through Fortitude\
  \ Valley to the river's edge.\n\nThe high-rise buildings peep through the gaps in\
  \ the Story Bridge. Purple jacaranda trees line the shoreline and with a view reminiscent\
  \ of the New York skyline, there is an air of relaxation.\n\nBrisbane has managed\
  \ to push its way into my heart. And if the new and innovative openings are anything\
  \ to go by, it's going to only get better."
