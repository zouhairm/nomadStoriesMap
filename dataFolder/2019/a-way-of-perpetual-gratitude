Text: "A long flight from Indonesia to Saudi Arabia was the beginning of my first\
  \ religious experience called Umrah. The passengers of this 9 hours flight were\
  \ mostly the Umrah travelers. Together as Moslem, we firstly prayed by spelling\
  \ Niyyat/intention to begin every action in life. We did the Umrah Niyyat in the\
  \ plane just right above the Miqat point ; the specific area to begin Umrah. A local\
  \ guide called Mutawif picked us up in the King Abdul Aziz Airport Jeddah, and then\
  \ we headed to the Great Mosque of Mecca. Once we entered the Mecca City, we're\
  \ reciting Talbiyah frequently along the way.\n\n\"Labbayk, Allahumma Labbayk. Labbayk,\
  \ La shareeka laka, Labbayk, Innalhamda wan-ni'mata laka wal-mulk, La shareeka lak.\"\
  \n\"O Allah, I intend to perform Umrah. Please make it easy for me and accept it\
  \ from me. Aameen.\"\n\nWe got a night snack on the way to Mecca, but it didn't\
  \ make me hungry due to my eyes have lost the energy to open it up. I woke up the\
  \ time we arrived at the hotel and for dozens of percentage I felt like my energy\
  \ being up. Not complete, but still able to manage my body to do the second step\
  \ of Umrah called Tawaf. In the midnight, we went to the Great Mosque to find the\
  \ Ka\u2019bah ; the cube-shaped structure that constructed of gray stone and marble,\
  \ it\u2019s oriented as the compass of all the Moslem in praying from everywhere.\
  \ In the corner of it there\u2019s Hajar Aswad ; a black stone which we believe\
  \ it came from heaven. Then it became the point where we started Tawaf by praying\
  \ and walking surrounding the Ka\u2019bah counter clockwise. After 7 times walking\
  \ around the Ka\u2019bah, we took a break a few meters where the Zam-Zam water were\
  \ placed. It\u2019s the unlimited water source in the Mecca that has good effects\
  \ for body and medicine for any diseases. While drinking the Zam-zam, it\u2019s\
  \ not only the water that freshly streaming down to the throat. As we\u2019re facing\
  \ Ka\u2019bah, the vibe of hundred people having Tawaf together and knowing all\
  \ the Moslem around the world were praying to this same direction just felt like\
  \ having new spirit injections.\n\nWe finished the Umrah by taking the last two\
  \ step called Sa\u2019ey and Tahalul. The Mutawif led us to do Sa\u2019i by walking\
  \ and praying between the Safa and Marwah hills about 7 trips back and forth. The\
  \ hill tracks located inside the Great Mosque and it\u2019s super clean because\
  \ no shoes were allowed. We walked about roughly 2 miles barefooted or with any\
  \ socks. We ended Sa\u2019ey by the last ritual of shaving some our hair for hygiene\
  \ purposes called Tahalul. We blended with the other Umrah Traveler from the other\
  \ country while doing it and completed our Umrah with the perpetual gratitude."
