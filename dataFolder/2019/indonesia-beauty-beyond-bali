Text: "It was a stormy yet sunny November when I went to Banda Neira Island located\
  \ in Maluku Province, the eastern part of Indonesia. It was a long-awaited vacation\
  \ because this was my first time going to the eastern part of Indonesia. I was warned\
  \ by family and friends not to travel to beaches or islands because there were tsunami\
  \ and earthquake in several areas including the eastern part of Indonesia. I was\
  \ worried that the trip has to be canceled but also afraid that there will be an\
  \ aftershock tsunami. But in the end, I\u2019m ready to accept it if the worst case\
  \ comes since my life is more important after all.\n\nEntering the week when my\
  \ trip to Banda Neira should commence, the weather\u2019s shining bright followed\
  \ by small rain some times as if nature knows I was excited about this trip. I took\
  \ the midnight flight from Seokarno-Hatta International Airport in Jakarta and arrived\
  \ in the morning around 6 a.m. in Pattimura International Airport in Ambon. I took\
  \ a car for about an hour that drove me to the port and onboard to the boat that\
  \ will take me to Banda Neira in 6 hours if the weather in a good mood. Fortunately,\
  \ it was.\n\nWhen I set my feet in Banda Neira port, I was awed by the view. When\
  \ I turned my back, hills were lined up beside the sea that bridge the port and\
  \ the hills. It was 4.30 p.m. when I arrived in Banda Neira, the sun shines so brightly\
  \ from the back of the hills as if welcoming the tourists with a warm hug. I just\
  \ set my foot and my eyes had been spoiled already with the scenery, I thought.\
  \ \n\nBanda Neira is a small island. You only need 2 hours to explore the whole\
  \ corner of the island. They don\u2019t have public transportation here so tourist\
  \ will have to go anywhere by walk and locals usually have motorbike for mobility.\
  \ They don\u2019t have hotel like you found in an overrated tourist spot here. There\
  \ are only 2 two-stories hotel building (Maulana Hotel and Cilu Bintang Hotel) that\
  \ considered as \u2018fancy\u2019 and the rest are just guest house. Maulana hotel\
  \ was the first hotel that Banda Neira has ever had and this hotel was where Princess\
  \ Diana of Great Britain stayed during her vacation here. Meanwhile Cilu Bintang\
  \ Hotel, where I stayed during my visit, located in front of Belgica Fortress and\
  \ right beside Nassau Fortress that used by the Dutch during their colonization\
  \ on the island. Really good for travelers who want to enjoy cultural and historical\
  \ heritage from this hotel. \n\nThere are about 6 smaller islands around Banda Neira\
  \ for island hopping and snorkeling around it. The water is clear with the startling\
  \ underwater structure that will be perfect for diving lovers and the corals are\
  \ beautiful for snorkeling. You can rent diving or snorkeling equipment in several\
  \ places here with competitive price. Just ask your tour guide or local people where\
  \ to rent, and they will be more than happy to share you several options.\n\nWhen\
  \ I went there, on the way to one of the islands around 1.5 hours from Banda Neira,\
  \ I was lucky to meet dolphins schooling and approaching my boat as if saying hello\
  \ to us. That was one of the most memorable moments I\u2019ve ever had in my life\
  \ since I never met dolphins in its natural habitat and not every tourist can get\
  \ that kind of scenery, I was told.\n\nThe islands are a perfect recommendation\
  \ for a traveler who wants to avoid urban noise. White sands, clear water, quietness,\
  \ and the underwater is just a complete package to relieve stress from work or basically\
  \ anything you are stressing about. Banda Neira is a must vacation spot when you\
  \ visit Indonesia! Well, there are lots of islands that you need to explore when\
  \ you visit this country."
