Text: "Komodo Island Flores, July 2015.\n\n11 days. Going to another island, more\
  \ than 1000 km from home, spending our holiday in the fasting month, meeting new\
  \ people and having a new family, staying 6 days on the boat, having \u201Csahur\u201D\
  \ with the boat crew, starting from being seasick till becoming used to it even\
  \ after we get off, feeling like everything is moving when we are back on the land.\n\
  \nShowering with sea water, climbing the waterfall at Mojo Island, forgetting the\
  \ guitar at the airport and having to pick it up again that same day, forgetting\
  \ all the sunblock we bought in Jakarta and having to buy the new ones in Lombok.\
  \ Learning to operate the boat, seeing the sun and the moon at the same time in\
  \ the morning, being chased by komodos, seeing snakes that could kill people in\
  \ 20 minutes, seeing dolphins in their natural habitat while looking at the sunset,\
  \ having new brothers dan sisters from America, Turkey, Germany, Netherlands, Canada,\
  \ England, and Switzerland. Having new uncles and aunties from France, Tunisia,\
  \ Denmark, and Brazil.\n\nExplaining why we didn\u2019t eat our lunch, asking our\
  \ new family their opinions about Indonesia and why they chose Indonesia as their\
  \ holiday destination.\n\nGoing to so many beaches starting from the one with white\
  \ sand up till the ones with pink and orange sand. Exploring Nusa Tenggara Barat\
  \ from Lombok, Sumbawa, until Labuan Bajo. Going back to Lombok via Sumbawa, visiting\
  \ an island occupied by a single family cause they found the island 40 years ago\
  \ (the island named Gili Bedil / Gili Bola), going to Gili Trawangan with an outgoing\
  \ taxi driver who taught us the Sasak language, chillin\u2019 and relaxing at the\
  \ famous Gili Trawangan, continuing our journey to East Lombok using a small boat\
  \ owned by the family of our guide (also receiving discount). Staying in Mataram,\
  \ having \u201Csahur\u201D at Mataram Mall, running to the place because we were\
  \ running out of time, going to the airport which turned out to be closed because\
  \ of the mountain eruption that happened the day before, so we had to extend our\
  \ trip for a day and decided to stay in a very nice hotel which we were extremely\
  \ lucky and got 60% discount , and then we ran out of money. Thankfully we had sponsors,\
  \ our parents. \n\nThank you to everyone who were a part of the amazing journey,\
  \ for the incredible experience and unforgettable memories, especially to my super\
  \ cousins Mbak Rara and Elmira, and my lil brother, Idhan. Who were with me from\
  \ the beginning to the end of our Lombok \u2013 Flores adventure."
