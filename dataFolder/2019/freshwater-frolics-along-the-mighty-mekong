Text: "Tears of heaven pour down, going pitter-patter over the Mekong River. A massive,\
  \ wooden boat floats by, carrying a mountain of rice husks, for various uses such\
  \ as fuel and fish feed. I wave at the ferrymen onboard and they happily wave back,\
  \ clearly rejoicing in the rain. They know that each soaked grain creates a load\
  \ that is securely weighed down and will not in the least be blown away by the wind,\
  \ saving a portion of their livelihood.\n\nI am on a balcony and it is attached\
  \ to an altogether different kind of vessel. The Aqua Mekong, with its matte-black\
  \ hull and ship-shape block-design, is a sleek floating feature among curvier and\
  \ prosaic boats, gliding and adding to the many furrows on this mighty stream. Operated\
  \ by Aqua Expeditions, it is currently transporting its own bread and butter of\
  \ about 16 guests, 37 crew members, 4 local guides and a cruise director.\n\nDesigned\
  \ by Saigon-based architectural firm Noor Design, the 60m-long luxury cruise comes\
  \ complete with 20 suites, able to board a maximum of only 40 passengers. Such an\
  \ intimate number allows for a one-to-one, or even a two-to-one staff-to-guest ratio\
  \ at times. Hence, true personalised service is easily embodied, where each guest\
  \ is always greeted by name and hands are never void of a favourite drink or scented\
  \ cold towel throughout the whole voyage. \n\nThe Aqua Mekong also provides the\
  \ best alternative way to travel from Cambodia to Vietnam, or vice versa. Embarking\
  \ from Siem Reap, Phnom Penh or Ho Chi Minh, the Aqua Mekong transport guests down\
  \ or up the Mekong River with cruise options of seven nights, four nights or three\
  \ nights. I opted to venture down the mighty river from Phnom Penh to Ho Chi Minh\
  \ City. And the befalling downpour does not damper the experience. Instead, I relax\
  \ on the king-sized bed in my chic and spacious, floating suite \u2014 a far cry\
  \ from cramped seats on a plane or car. There\u2019s also plenty of indoor and shaded\
  \ amenities like a petite-sized infinity pool overlooking fresh water; a gym with\
  \ a view; a private cinema; and spa treatment rooms for a relaxing Khmer massage.\n\
  \nAnd forget about subpar airline meals. There daily local fares served at Aqua\
  \ Mekong are elegant sit-down dining room affairs, all created and sometimes prepared\
  \ by Michelin-starred chef David Thompson. Thompson, owner of renowned Thai cuisine\
  \ award-winning haunts Nahm and Long Chim, is the cruise\u2019s consulting chef\
  \ and occasionally joins the kitchen team on special chef-hosted departures. The\
  \ onboard team of mostly local chefs whips up Southeast Asian recipes, as meals\
  \ shift from refined Khmer delicacies to a hot bowl of sweet and sour Mekong fish\
  \ soup as the Aqua Mekong glides into Vietnamese territories, often incorporating\
  \ the day\u2019s catch or the many fresh produce they\u2019ve purchased on their\
  \ regional market run. \n\nWhen the weather is better, guests can also tag along\
  \ on these market tours. The designated local guides lead shore excursions twice\
  \ a day, ranging from a variety of activities such as cycling, kayaking or on-foot\
  \ outings. We would first hop on a small, aluminum boat with low emission engines\
  \ to reach deeper destinations like canals and waterfront wooden villages otherwise\
  \ missed if we were to travel on land. \n\nWe are occasionally invited into rural\
  \ homes to experience the heartbeat of the local communities. Many children are\
  \ seen smiling, the only form of communication in the face of a clear language barrier.\
  \ Still, the Aqua Expedition English-speaking guides narrate the stirring stories\
  \ of the millions of people who live, work and play along the Mekong, which flows\
  \ through many countries: China, Burma, Thailand, Laos, Cambodia, and finally Vietnam.\n\
  \nThere\u2019s no doubt the trans-boundary watercourse is a lifeline to the regions\
  \ it crosses. Such captivating accounts and vistas, coupled with artisanal touches\
  \ of luxury on the main vessel make Aqua Mekong truly an exceptional cruise. While\
  \ people generally cannot wait to step out of a moving vehicle at the end of their\
  \ journey, this cruise makes often tedious travel a luxury sojourn experience. I\
  \ simply did not want to disembark and would rather cruise on, and on, and on."
