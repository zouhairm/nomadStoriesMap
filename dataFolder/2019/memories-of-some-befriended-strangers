Text: "Memories of some befriended strangers\n\nMy parents taught me something every\
  \ Indian parent teaches their young children stepping out of the house unattended-\
  \ never talk to strangers or eat anything they give. Consequently, I had a hard\
  \ time recounting my chance encounters traveling alone in Europe to them. To parents\
  \ who lived on the edge while their free-sirited daughter travels solo across Europe\
  \ to see her favourite bands perform live in Poland and Germany, stay with a host\
  \ family in Paris and teach English to Spanish professionals in Madrid.\n\nBeing\
  \ stuck on the train station in Poland without any priors was tricky. Enter suspiciously\
  \ cheerful Polish man offering to help a clueless tourist holding her house on her\
  \ shoulders. His overtly selfless, nice-natured smile, that in retrospect was genuine,\
  \ seemed alarming as he beckoned me to the ticket counter to purchase the right\
  \ ticket while reaching for my giant suitacase. As he conversed in Polish with the\
  \ lady at the counter, I never once let my air shotgun guard down, all set to hit\
  \ and run. Interrupting my absurdity, he handed me a paid ticket. As I reached for\
  \ my purse to pay him, he smiled the same suspicious smile saying, \u2018This is\
  \ our welcome to you from Poland.\u2019 After helping me carry my bag right up to\
  \ the platform, he bid me farewell and disappeared into the sea of strange faces.\
  \ For the next two minutes, there I stood, feeling the magnitude of that nice gesture\
  \ wash over me.\n\nThe next epiphany occurred as I was sat on a picnic mat in a\
  \ park in Isartor, Munich with a German lady I didn\u2019t know two hours ago- \u2018\
  Who needs friends for vacations when there are mildly good strangers?\u2019 Bronzing\
  \ under the perfect afternoon sun, I badly wished for some company to click some\
  \ pictures of me. Enter Julia Stolzenberg and her adorable (lazy) dog Philius, the\
  \ only people around and my prospective photographers. With Europe compounding my\
  \ impulsiveness, I invited the duo to join me for a quick, sunkissed picnic on my\
  \ mat after, which turned into a 2 hour conversation. Julia had visited India, was\
  \ a media professional and planned on travelling soon just like me. Turns out, we\
  \ had a lot to talk about spanning everything under the sun (pun intended).\n\n\
  Certain people enter our lives out of nowhere only to leave the strongest impressions.\
  \ An English teaching programme was hardly the place to hear complete, meaningful\
  \ sentences let alone find sentences that held meaning, or so I thought. Ines, a\
  \ 40-something independent, single lady told me about her stints playing batukada\
  \ drums with her troop from time to time after finishing her ambitious corporate\
  \ day job. And Maria, a 30-something lady broke her brain in front of me without\
  \ regret. Stories of self-worth and sentiments from these two women I met during\
  \ Diverbo\u2019s english teaching programme changed my perspective for the better.\n\
  \nNever in my wildest dreams had I dreamt about exchanging cultures over wine and\
  \ cheese with a 70 yr old french couple. A week spent with my host family O\u2019\
  Learys in Paris reinforced my conviction in forging local connections. We shared\
  \ our parts of the world in the form of Indian bhaji, pav, srikhand and bhajiya,\
  \ and drawing metro maps to make me an independent part-time Parisian. The O\u2019\
  Learys advising me, a confuse millenial about choosing the right career path as\
  \ we sat eating cr\xE8me after dinner one evening will forver stay in my heart as\
  \ the loveliest memory of the couple who verify the use of word \u2018family\u2019\
  . Voracious reader Denis homed an extensive collection of Le Routards across many\
  \ countries but India. So huddled next to many Indian spices and artifacts I carried\
  \ from India, I snuck in a copy of \u2019Le Routard- India\u2019 hoping for them\
  \ to make my day with a text reading, \u201CCh\xE8re Utsavi, \xC0 bient\xF4t chez\
  \ toi.\u201D\n\nMy mother\u2019s upper lip curls at the mention of strangers I befriended\
  \ and my father\u2019s eyes widen. But there is so much heart in those moments,\
  \ dear parents. I say with surity that those fragments of niceness are fuller than\
  \ so many memories I have!"
