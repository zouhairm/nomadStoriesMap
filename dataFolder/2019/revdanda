Text: "REVDANDA\nMurud and the adjacent sea fort Janjira are popular tourist places\
  \ in Konkan, Maharashtra. Like hundreds of people, it is also my favorite activity\
  \ to enjoy my vacation in that region. Like others my first stop would be Alibagh\
  \ and then travel to Murud. There is only one road from Alibagh to Murud, accentuated\
  \ by many beautiful beaches on the right side of the road. The road passes through\
  \ a small town of Revdanda where Kundalika River meets the Arabic sea.\nMy routine\
  \ on this road consists of stopping in Revdanda for snacks and beer. Especially\
  \ in summer when it\u2019s hot and sunny, take a break from travel, relax a bit\
  \ and then go ahead. I have been doing this for years. Revdanda is a small town,\
  \ always bustling with activity. The roads are narrow,\ncrowded with hawkers and\
  \ fruit sellers. Here and there you see broken, worn out ruins of brick and stone\
  \ walls. When you are in coastal region of Konkan and western region of Maharashtra\
  \ state, one comes across hundreds of ruins of stone buildings built almost 300\
  \ to 500 years ago. So I never gave another thought to them in Revdanda. Until one\
  \ day.\nI remember that day, it was a bright summer afternoon. Me and my friend\
  \ on our break from\ndriving, met a old man. He asked us if we were tourists, and\
  \ the usual things a tourist is asked by locals wherever they go. And then he proceeded\
  \ giving us directions to some place which was amazing according to him. Just go\
  \ there, you will love it, he said. After relaxing some time we started towards\
  \ Murud again. Since we had lot of time, we decided to check out that old man\u2019\
  s directions. We thought we would be wasting time only if there was nothing interesting\
  \ there. So we took a right turn and went ahead along that wall. Had to get out\
  \ of the car after a little distance. We were surrounded by dense plantation of\
  \ tall coconut trees. Then we walked ahead, there was another huge wall in front\
  \ of us made from bricks and stones. And just like that man said there was opening\
  \ in the wall where the bricks and stones had collapsed. We could see a beach and\
  \ the sea from that opening. We remembered, \u201CWalk straight through that opening,\
  \ cross the beach, reach the ocean. Don\u2019t look back till then.\u201D the old\
  \ man had told us. So we walked through that opening, greeted by nice cool ocean\
  \ breeze and kept walking till our feet touched the ocean water.\nThen, we looked\
  \ back. It was a sight to behold. We were looking at a fort, spread across the beach,\
  \ a coat of coconut tree tops protruding out on top. The beach was empty, with only\
  \ herons and seagulls for company. But the sight of the fort, it was amazing. While\
  \ driving through Revdanda, we never realized we were driving through a fort. From\
  \ where we stood we could see the Revdanda Bridge to the right, but we never realized\
  \ there was a beautiful beach so near when we were crossing that bridge.\nI immediately\
  \ fell in love with that place. After that every time I spend my vacation in this\
  \ region, I always go directly to Revdanda beach. It\u2019s a different feeling,\
  \ sitting with my back to the beautiful land fort and just watching the calm ocean.\
  \ The beach is safe, it\u2019s a very beautiful place, with river water merging\
  \ with the ocean on one side. It\u2019s a pleasure to walk along the coast, watching\
  \ herons, lapwings and seagulls hunt for food. The fort wall is always a delight\
  \ to explore. And unlike rest of the beaches in this region, which are always crowded\
  \ with tourists, this beach almost always is mostly empty.\nOn searching I came\
  \ to know, Revdanda fort was built by Portuguese Captain Soj, completed in 1524.\
  \ Portuguese controlled it till 1806.The village of Revdanda, now a bustling small\
  \ town, is actually situated inside the fort. This fort and beach are now one of\
  \ my favorite destinations, thanks to a local old man. It is one of the must visit\
  \ places in north Konkan."
