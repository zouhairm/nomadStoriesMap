Text: "\u201CI\u2019m not a witch.\u201D Dark eyes glanced at me quickly over his\
  \ shoulder. He moved fast, drawing an outline in the hot sand with his feet. \u201C\
  But, I\u2019m drawing this so the sun will come back out. Maybe it's magic.\u201D\
  \ Finishing his design, a child\u2019s round circle sun with long straight rays,\
  \ he sat next to me and introduced himself under clouds that still threatened rain.\
  \ M\xE1rcio.\n\nSalvador, Bahia, Brazil is cobblestone streets, rocks and stones\
  \ shaped and laid by slaves. It smells of ripening fruit, sweat, and salted dirt.\
  \ Music plays loud over speakers, mixing with instruments - berimbau, tambourine\
  \ - as students play capoeira. Stands sell green coconuts to drink: each proprietor\
  \ hacks off the top with short, practiced machete-strikes before sticking a brightly\
  \ colored bendy-straw inside. Salvador is Havaianas flip flops, bright bathing suits,\
  \ jeans, uniforms, and high heels. A tangle of people and dogs. When it is the season\
  \ for rain, it comes every day, strong and clear. The cobblestones are slick and\
  \ clean, the open windows let in fresh, humid air.\n\nI arrived late to Salvador.\
  \ While the other students gathered, I waited, anxious, with my Nana in Massachusetts.\
  \ We pretended at watching TV and updated my Bapa when he asked. At the knock, we\
  \ pulled open the door, breathless. A startled delivery man looked down, started\
  \ to read my name, and I squealed. Nana and I laughed when he handed over the slim\
  \ envelope. My passport and visa for Brazil. I was on the plane the next day.\n\n\
  I studied in the mornings in Salvador, taking classes from professors hired by our\
  \ exchange program while the local university was on strike. We practiced Portuguese,\
  \ learned Brazilian history, studied sociology, religion, and traditions. In the\
  \ afternoons, I took the \xF4nibus back to my host mother\u2019s apartment. Rice\
  \ and beans, vegetables, fruit, and fried or steamed fish lined the table for every\
  \ lunch. My host mother would sit across from me while I ate, and worry the buttons\
  \ on her shirt. Her mascara smudged, her hair tangled. \u201CMy dad left,\u201D\
  \ her daughter told me.\n\nNext to the sand-drawn sun, M\xE1rcio and I talked for\
  \ nearly an hour, until the rain drops started to fall, first leaving bullet-tip\
  \ indentations in the warm sand, then quickening into sheets. Running for cover,\
  \ I gave him my phone number.\n\nM\xE1rcio smiles at me as we pay the uniformed\
  \ money collector sitting at the back of the lurching \xF4nibus. I listen to conversations\
  \ in Portuguese, a baby laughing, and watch the ocean out the window. We get off\
  \ at Pitua\xE7o Park, and splash around the lake in a paddleboat before renting\
  \ bikes for an hour. It\u2019s hot. The sun beats into my shoulders as I pedal.\
  \ No one else is riding on the trail. We stop to buy some water from an ancient\
  \ woman on a blanket. M\xE1rcio, long hair tucked behind his ears, dark eyes sparkling\
  \ under thick eyebrows, gets her talking and laughing. She tells us about her long-term\
  \ boyfriend. He doesn\u2019t want to get married, she complains. Biking on, we push\
  \ through burning sunshine, meet a group of boys playing marbles. M\xE1rcio, smiling,\
  \ calling, dancing, asks one of the boys to show me how to play. I learn nothing,\
  \ my head thick in the heat. Content, I watch the group play and talk before he\
  \ hikes down the dirt path snaking to homes built below. \u201CIt\u2019s not safe\
  \ for you,\u201D he warns, serious, \u201Cstay with the bikes.\u201D The green around\
  \ me is vivid, pressing into my eyes. M\xE1rcio reappears suddenly, coconut ice\
  \ cream in hand. Homemade, tied in a plastic bag, we bite the ends off. The milky\
  \ coconut melts down my throat. Our hour of biking complete, we walk to the orla\
  \ da praia, beach boardwalk, to watch the ocean. The salt wind from the waves dries\
  \ on my skin as the sun shines hot and bright. My best afternoon in Salvador is\
  \ with a magician."
