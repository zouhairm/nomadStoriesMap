Text: "They say that in the desert you face your loneliness and your fear.\nBut at\
  \ the end you learn to love it, embrace it and let it become your friend and guide.\n\
  This is where I realized how all my travels were. One amazing travel story. \nBut\
  \ my story has been tampered with. \nIt has been tampered with by all the people\
  \ I have met along the way.\nTravelers and locals alike. Strange, sometimes friendly\
  \ and sometimes unfamiliar faces. They have all become my mentors and my inspiration.\n\
  So this story is not only mine anymore. It has been mixed up, just like the sand\
  \ from the dunes mixes up with the desert wind and new dunes emerge, seemingly out\
  \ of nowhere.\nSahara desert, Egypt.\nI am sitting on the top of a high dune, at\
  \ the peak of the day. The sun warms up my skin, burning it slightly. The wind cools\
  \ it off, giving me a chance to observe all the silence. I see sand running down\
  \ the dune like a little river, making me slightly dizzy and I am wondering how\
  \ I ended up here. \nA shy western girl, in one of the world\xB4s most intense deserts.\
  \ \nFear I had, but now it\u2019s gone. Lonely I was, but now I just feel complete.\n\
  And suddenly I knew what it was.\nThe immense kindness of a stranger, deciding to\
  \ help a lost backpacker at the edge of the road.\nThe na\xEFve trucker, who brings\
  \ you to a highway tavern and asks the lady there to let you camp for the night.\
  \ The lady kindly accepts and even makes you soup. A magical, flavorful soup, the\
  \ best one you\xB4ve ever had. Then she disappears at the back with one customer\
  \ at the time.\nWonderful women covered by heavy chadors help you through the chaotic\
  \ situations of their cities. They do not speak any language other than their own,\
  \ but they manage to help. They invite you into their homes and share with you their\
  \ humble food. They show you their underwear and curiously try to look at yours.\
  \ You are being paraded and shown off to their friend and relatives, you are a prize\
  \ and a rare sight to their little village. Shortly you move on and it is all just\
  \ a memory now.\nThen there is the traveller you once met and had such a profound\
  \ impact on you, that they would never even guess.\nThe hostels and the little families\
  \ formed there every now and then. The random strangers forming these families are\
  \ your fellas now. You share your meals, your laughs, your time and yourself. You\
  \ may suspect it, but you don\xB4t know just yet, that these people will forever\
  \ remain in your life and mind somehow. \nSoon you are on the road again, but the\
  \ sadness of separation is beautiful and you realize that it only lasts until you\
  \ hop on that bus to your next destination.\nAnd of course there is the love. The\
  \ love on the road.\nIntense, stronger than vodka and sweeter than Costa Rican Pineapple.\
  \ Oh, it\xB4s great! You live it, you love it and then it\xB4s over, just like it\
  \ started.\nIn the blink of an eye.  And it hurts, it really does, but next thing\
  \ you know, you are on that bus again and it\xB4s strangely all better. Again!\n\
  So, here you are. Sucking in all the beauty that the world has. \nThat hike on a\
  \ steep mountain, that playful day at the beach. The world is now your neighbourhood\
  \ and you are no longer a stranger. Now you blend in and you are free.\nI thank\
  \ the desert. And the dry, hot air for giving me so much. How can it be, that such\
  \ a seemingly hostile environment attracts us so much?\nThen I am reminded that\
  \ harshness is not all that a desert is. Just a few dunes away lay beautiful green\
  \ oases, abundant with food, water, life and beauty."
