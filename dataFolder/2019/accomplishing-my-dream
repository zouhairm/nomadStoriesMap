Text: "\u201CYour crazy if you think of your to open a class for special needs in\
  \ a 3rd world country will come true.\u201D Negatively. The unbelievers. I am a\
  \ 25 year old female and can tell you my dream is closer than what you expect. Paying\
  \ for my own education and backpacking experience. I return from backpacking India\
  \ alone feb 27, 2019. When I was there my eyes opened along with my heart. It was\
  \ touched by so many people, children, and women. I traveled along with members\
  \ of Matti Community. I received so much love and learning experience, something\
  \ books can\u2019t teach you. I love school but this something you need to experience\
  \ and not read about. I traveled for 27 days visiting women empowerment, Matti Community\
  \ sessions, children homes, the built of children library\u2019s, special need schools,\
  \ and  villages. I learned with whatever little you have, dosnt matter you can always\
  \ be happy. They say India is dirty, smelly etc.. What I saw was respect, love,\
  \ people trying to make a difference. Out of my whole experience what touched me\
  \ the most was the passion to make the new generation into a better one. This is\
  \ not to win a trip. This is so someone can read and realize dreams are a reality\
  \ just push your self. I did and I can tell you that one day I will have  my class\
  \ one day I will be a teacher for special needs and one day I will make that diffrence.\
  \ I saw the beginning of my dream and I won\u2019t let it end. Much love Candy"
