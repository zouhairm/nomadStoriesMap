Text: "Although dampened from the soundproofing of the tall man\u2019s armpit covering\
  \ my ear, I heard a distinctive \u201Cclunk\u201D sound and struggled to\u202Ftwist\u202F\
  my head, checking the floor for my beloved travel companion.\u202FI was on my way\
  \ back from Mondello beach in Sicily to Palermo, where I had just updated my\u202F\
  Instagram\u202Ffollowers about how amazing my life was. The sight of the beach and\
  \ the Mediterranean sea was jaw-dropping, with its white sand and\u202Fturquoise\u202F\
  still water. Extremely social media worthy. I had cropped my photo cleverly too\
  \ before posting, so it hadn't seemed that crowded, though I was barely able to\
  \ find a space for my towel among the masses. \u202F \n \nStepping off and untangling\
  \ myself from the crowded bus, I gasped for\u202Fair and checked for my phone again,\
  \ this time in my handbag where I had left it. Watching as the bus drove off, I\
  \ realised it was gone and with it so was my travel companion, my address, my sense\
  \ of direction and my attempts at communicating through basic Italian. I wasn\u2019\
  t a brave lone traveller anymore. I was vulnerable and my fear of embarrassment\
  \ and failure coupled with distinctive memories of pre-phone travel misadventures\
  \ were coming back to haunt me.\u202F \n \n\u201CBreathe\u2026\u201D I reminded\
  \ myself. \u201CThis is a once in a lifetime opportunity and a missing phone is\u202F\
  not going to ruin it.\u201D Without easy access to all of the answers, I would just\
  \ have to transform the fear of the unknown into the joy of discovery. \n \nI had\
  \ relied so heavily until now on technology, constant engagement, and life through\
  \ a lens that I wasn't sure how to just be, alone. But after 3 days, waking to the\
  \ sound of my vintage alarm clock, something changed. Walking through familiar streets\
  \ but as if for the first time, I\u202Fsaw\u202Fthe secret street passages, the\
  \ hidden blood on churches and the Cathedral wall. The intricate detail of the architecture\
  \ contrasting\u202Fagainst the crumbling houses.  \n \nFear came and went.\u202F\
  \u202FI was alone but not lonely, surrounded by fellow sufferers of my condition\
  \ and easy friends. I was ever-present, yet with an overwhelming sense of the history\
  \ that had gone before me. My eyes made my mouth water but I tasted\u202FArancini,\
  \ Caponata and Brioche gelato sandwiches\u202Fwith eyes closed, felt the\u202Fsand\
  \ beneath my toes and my weightlessness as I floated through salty water. I touched\
  \ real maps. I discovered secrets not even Google could know.\u202F Compelled to\
  \ write, just like \u201CDanilo\u201D, \u201CBanana\u201D and \u201CTe\u202Famo\u202F\
  Mary\u201D at the Cathedral gates before me, passers-by photographed my strange\
  \ habit \u2013 as if I were as ancient as the rock beneath me."
