Text: "I booked a travel to Norway in the middle of it all. My best friend was studying\
  \ there and I had a 10 days vacations to use ASAP. Well, this is perfect, I thought.\
  \ In fact, I really thought travelling would be a good thing. It would be like a\
  \ escape, a way to face things I had to face, but outside my routine, outside my\
  \ safe space. \nNorway had me at the airport. Big words saying \u201CGet ready to\
  \ explore Fjord Norway\u201D. Damn, I was ready. Regardless of the jetlag, the next\
  \ day was reserved for a famous norwegian hike. Kjerag is famous because it leads\
  \ you to a suspense stone between two rocks. Oh dear, am I really ready to explore\
  \ Fjord Norway? Considering everything that I was going through, maybe it would\
  \ be a good idea to just give up, have a cup of coffe and wait for my friends to\
  \ come back. Perhaps some hot chocolate. However, as soon as we arrived there I\
  \ felt something. \nAccording to our bus driver from Stavanger to Kjerag, that was\
  \ the most perfect day of the entire season for hiking. It was the last bright sunny\
  \ day of summer and we were lucky people. I realized then I was supposed to be there.\
  \ The hiking consists of climbing three mountains and at the end of the last one\
  \ the gold pot: kjeragbolten, the famous crazy stone between the rocks. The reward,\
  \ the art of nature, the beautiful and exclusive media for Instagram. \nThe first\
  \ mountain was so steep they had cables to help us hike. My breath was short and\
  \ fast. I could not see the beauty surrounding me. If I could pay attention I would\
  \ have even listened to people\u2019s joy. But my mind was focused on all the signs\
  \ my body was getting used to know: dry mouth, shortness of breath, dizzy mind,\
  \ negative thoughts. I pulled the strenght out of my friends words of encouragement.\
  \ After struggling a little, I realized I was at the top of the first mountain.\
  \ And man, what a view. \nMountains, rivers, green as far as I could see, people,\
  \ friends, families, dogs, goats. Yes, goats. How did they get there? Well, I know\
  \ how I got there. Along with the goats, we kept walking and laughing and drinking\
  \ fresh water from the river. On our way through the last mountain it hit me: I\
  \ did it. I felt brave. I felt courageous. Powerful. Wind danced with my hair. Sang\
  \ in my ears. I am capable. Dandelions flew everywhere. I am capable of anything\
  \ and travelling makes me see it crystal clear. \nBeing recently hired at my job\
  \ came with a lot of responsabilites. Also, I was writing my thesis for graduation.\
  \ Also, I was going through a difficult relationship at the time. Also, I had just\
  \ found out I was facing an anxiety disorder that I still did not know how to deal\
  \ with. Yep, a travel to Norway it is. A hiking it is. Jetlagged. Anxious. Insecure.\
  \ Scared. I did it. I reached the gold pot. Later, I understand it wasn't gold the\
  \ pot was holding. It was my own strenght. My willpower. We can do anything. Norway\
  \ it is."
