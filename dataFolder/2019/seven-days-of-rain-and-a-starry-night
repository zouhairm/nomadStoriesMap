Text: "It was an old Fiat Punto, running on methane gas. Filled with all of our stuff\
  \ it almost touched the ground. I can remember the three backpacks, a plastic ball,\
  \ towels, dry food and cans everywhere. Something like twenty of these were tuna\u2019\
  s. A huge beach umbrella, toilet paper and tissues stuffed in every empty hole and\
  \ a cable cooler. The cooler actually contained a huge bowl of couscous and a set\
  \ of ten beers. On top of everything else, two tents.\nWe agreed on shifting places\
  \ every four hours because the empty backseat was a torture. Due to the plan we\
  \ were to descend the peninsula\u2019s \u201Cboot\u201D in five days at top, then\
  \ decide whether to go to Calabria or Puglia. A road trip based on free camping.\
  \ Italian law\u2019s unclear about it. If you try and do some research it turns\
  \ out no one knows if it\u2019s legal or not, but a lot of people do it. Some places\
  \ have put signs to ban it, especially in nature reserves. Those were the places\
  \ were we never slept alone. As a fact we tried to be always ready to leave in a\
  \ big hurry. I mean, only if we agreed to abandon most of our supplies.\nAugust\
  \ in Italy is cruely hot and humid, the only chance to survive is laying down in\
  \ seasides and private beaches. Furnitures and facilitations all included, if you\
  \ pay. We all agreed on heading to hidden public shores, forced into a can which\
  \ couldn\u2019t run more than 120 km/h.\nIt rained. For the entire first week. I\
  \ wish that cooled down the temperature a bit but it just got us more wet. Luckily\
  \ it used not to rain during the night, allowing us to put the tent, sleep, waking\
  \ up dazed and cram everything into the car before the storm - coffees in our hands.\n\
  When it broke into rain during a stop in Naples for a pizza (well, plus a fried\
  \ pizza and a pasta napoletana per each) we were laughing, but beaten. Yet another\
  \ wet escape in that wheeled can the Fiat was. We drove in the rain, stopped at\
  \ Battipaglia to get some mozzarella where it\u2019s said they invented it, then\
  \ left again to Maratea.\nWe\u2019ve been told there was a nice beach there, also\
  \ public, so we could\u2019ve put our tents for the night. It took longer then expected,\
  \ precisely almost twice the time needed. Because of the traffic, because of the\
  \ wrong roads we took, because of the rain. We were exhausted from the uncomfortable\
  \ car and the hard digestion, when the night came. We randomly descended paths out\
  \ of fights we started just due to the fact we didn\u2019t know where to go. The\
  \ rain stopped 50 kms before, the sky was clear, the stars and the moon shining\
  \ above everything.\nWe stopped on a headland, tired of shouting each other in the\
  \ car. After we let the sea be the only one to talk, we tried to focus. Around us\
  \ was an enormous public park, probably a beach under it, but there was no car path\
  \ to get there. We didn\u2019t want to drive again though, in need for rest and\
  \ still with a camp to set up, plus the dark night couldn\u2019t help. I was the\
  \ lookout, next to the car, and they went down. The waiting was longer than boring\
  \ and I ran out of cigarettes. In the end they came up saying that was the place.\n\
  If you travel in your own country you\u2019d never expect to find a place that amazing.\
  \ Because you were born there, you\u2019ve been living around it for years and yet\
  \ you never went there.\nCala Jannita\u2019s a little black sand beach boxed between\
  \ high rocks. The sea was furious and the moon so lit we needed no artificial lights\
  \ to set the camp. It was part public and part private, but no one was there to\
  \ monitor the place.\nWe were moved to goosebumps and all the tension got away.\
  \ Having found out our transitorial paradise, the only thing left to do was to rest\
  \ and to go on and find some more."
