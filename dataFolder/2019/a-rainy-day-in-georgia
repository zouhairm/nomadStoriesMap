Text: "In Tbilisi today everybody was getting married. The grey sky and drizzle didn\u2019\
  t dampen the enthusiasm of the wedding parties driving round every street, beeping\
  \ their horns so incessantly that I could, with eyes closed, imagine myself back\
  \ in India. By the waterfall in the city\u2019s historic centre, white-clad brides\
  \ and grooms in traditional Georgian costume, black dress with waistcoat and sword,\
  \ posed for photographs. Every church overflowed with well-wishers queuing to congratulate\
  \ the newly-weds, all watched over by the wide-eyed icons of the Georgian Orthodox\
  \ Church on the surrounding walls.\n\nDragging on his cigarette, our couchsurf host\
  \ Zura looked down onto another church emptying out its pious crowd. \u2018Some\
  \ people think religion\u2019s nice, but to me they\u2019re idiots. Racists and\
  \ homophobes, their thinking\u2019s all wrong.\u2019 Orthodox priests had recently\
  \ led a violent attack on Tbilisi\u2019s gay pride, \u201Cobviously having missed\
  \ that bit in the Bible about those without sin casting the first stone\u2026\u201D\
  \n\nZura was the perfect host to introduce Georgia, a free-thinking libertarian\
  \ with an amused, and exasperated, sense of his country\u2019s culture, past and\
  \ present. Certainly Georgia is worth getting to know. A European-style Christian\
  \ outpost stuck in the mountains between Russia, Muslim central Asia and the Middle\
  \ East. It\u2019s a country so distinct that its language is unrelated to any others\
  \ barring a mysterious connection with Basque.\n\nGeorgians, as portrayed by Zura,\
  \ are a people full of hospitable spirit and hot-blood, an apparently common combination\
  \ amongst highlanders. Their culture revolves around wine, elaborate toasts, feasting\
  \ and fighting. The late night brawls Zura sees every weekend are perhaps the modern\
  \ version of Georgia\u2019s duelling tradition.\n\nMore seriously, Zura claimed\
  \ 80% of the \u201CRussian\u201D mafia are Georgian. Certainly the Soviet Union\u2019\
  s biggest criminal, Josef Dzhugashvili, was Georgian. Dzhugasvili is better known\
  \ by his self-awarded title, the \u201Cman of steel\u201D, Stalin. Most Georgians\
  \ apparently condemn his crimes, but that hasn\u2019t stopped the local memorabilia\
  \ industry trying to cash in on their most infamous son, selling everything from\
  \ Stalin tea mugs to Stalin wine.\n\nZura spent his first 13 years in the USSR.\
  \ \u2018A typically quiet Soviet childhood\u2019 ended with the empire\u2019s collapse\
  \ and Georgia\u2019s chaotic birth. Crime spiralled beyond control and he witnessed\
  \ a sniper on top of the building where he still lives shooting someone dead and\
  \ dragging the corpse down the stairs, the bloody head banging on each step.\n\n\
  Modern Tbilisi, however, is relatively peaceful. The only violence I saw was a golden\
  \ man pushing a spear through the mouth of a dragon, the eponymous St George on\
  \ his pedestal in Freedom (formerly Lenin) Square. The old town does, however, threaten\
  \ sightseers with its beautiful houses seemingly poised halfway through elegant\
  \ collapse. Their walls covered in crumbling plaster appeared held together by rickety,\
  \ rotting outside staircases. Wooden balconies overhead clung on to their hosts\
  \ for dear life, trying to avoid falling onto the people below. \n\nAt dusk we climbed\
  \ up the backstreets to a lit-up, ruined castle over-looking the city as drizzle\
  \ danced in the sky like the lightest of snow. Behind us fairy lights on a mini-Eifel\
  \ tower above the old town sputtered in the gathering dark and mist obscured the\
  \ top. With no high-rise visible in the city centre the buildings that stood out\
  \ were the churches, spilling illumination into the streets, and further away the\
  \ old neo-classical parliament building with a glass dome resembling Berlin\u2019\
  s Bundestag. But while Germany\u2019s version represents the principle of democratic\
  \ transparency, in Georgia no-one can enter the dome to see what the politicians\
  \ below are doing.\n\nFor Zura the current government are \u2018idiots\u2019 and\
  \ the previous government were \u2018idiots, just not as big idiots as the current\
  \ government\u2019. Too many Georgians, he argued, \u201Caren\u2019t adequate\u201D\
  , meaning they\u2019re lost in the country\u2019s glorious medieval past, not recognising\
  \ the changes required to meet modern challenges. \u2018They always say \u201Cwe\
  \ were the greatest in the 10th century\u201D, I couldn\u2019t give a shit about\
  \ that, I only care about what we are now, and what sort of country my daughter\
  \ will grow up in.\u2019 \n\nToday in Tbilisi everybody was getting married. What\
  \ sort of country the children of all the weddings will grow up into is anybody\u2019\
  s guess."
