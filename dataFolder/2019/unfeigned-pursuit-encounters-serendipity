Text: "Few years ago, a friend\u2019s story about tracing her descendants stirred\
  \ me to trace my roots. Few days of relentless research followed by a new job taking\
  \ precedence over this one, the pursuit seemed unfinished and closed.\nWhile making\
  \ a living at an IT firm (until, I recognised my calling!)  in \u2018Bengaluru\u2019\
  \ known as \u2018Bangalore\u2019 globally, over one of the long weekends, accompanied\
  \ with my group of nomads, decided to explore Hampi, the stunning heritage town.\n\
  Once we descended at the Hospet station (close to Hampi), the atmosphere seemed\
  \ archetypal and no peculiar detailing to adorn my time travel imagination. Only\
  \ until we reached the UNESCO town Hampi. The sight etched in my memory like a modern\
  \ day Claude Monet\u2019s inspiration to paint his masterpiece.\nWhat makes Hampi\
  \ a unique site apart from its magnificent past is divergence of the two sides of\
  \ the town; one the \u2018Bazaar\u2019 side, with its ruins, famed historical temples\
  \ and other monuments while the other side popularly known as \u2018Hippie Island\u2019\
  , stands to its name and a haven for the young tourists. Hampi is one of my top\
  \ destinations, due to the peaceful coexistence of the Hindu and Hippie culture.\
  \ \nWe grabbed a coracle and glided across the beautiful Tungabhadra river to reach\
  \ the \u2018Hippie Island\u2019. We strolled our way to the lodging while we adored\
  \ the view of the sprawling fields.\nWe hired a tuk-tuk/autorickshaw and an ingenious\
  \ guide. He trotted us around the Hippie Island; that hosts a lot of significant\
  \ sites that transpire in Ramayana (one of the two popular Hindu epics) and Hampi\
  \ known as Kiskindha in the historical times is the birth place of Hanuman (son\
  \ of wind God known for his valour and strength).\nWhile, the first day was reserved\
  \ for the Hippie Island; we bounced from caves to hills and adored sunset by the\
  \ river. Being an opacarophile, I revered the beauty of dusk. When the sun merged\
  \ into the sea for respite, its tangerine rays soothingly brushing past my face\
  \ reminding me its existence is the glory behind the spark of life. \nSuddenly,\
  \ something jarring caught my attention, the blinding slogan, \u201CBeware of crocodiles\u201D\
  . I interrupted my guide who was engrossed in enlightening and demonstrating my\
  \ fellow friend the art of stone skimming. \nI asked him inquisitively, \u201CReally,\
  \ crocodiles dwell here.\u201D\nHe retorted giggling in his mother-tongue influenced\
  \ English, \u201CMadam, foreigners come here during the peak seasons. They sunbathe\
  \ and swim, our local men also jump into the water to beat the heat. They don\u2019\
  t know how to swim, they drown. So, the local ministry put up that warning.\u201D\
  \nI acceded to the story with qualms for it was engaging, amusing and reminiscent\
  \ for a lifetime. \nThe next day, we advanced to the \u2018Bazaar\u2019 side of\
  \ the town and visited various monuments admiring the larger than life conveniences,\
  \ art and architecture, complimenting the splendid stories of the arduous Vijaynagara\
  \ kingdom (flourished between 14th to 16th centuries). Each monument although ravaged\
  \ and some in boulders resonated its glorious past in all its might and glory. \n\
  Our guide, although superfluous seemed nimble as he demonstrated with great effervesce.\
  \ At the tad end of the trip, he grieved about the treacherous battle that broke\
  \ out between the Bahmani sultans and the Vijayanagara kingdom .The battle led to\
  \ the downfall of the Vijayangara empire leading to hundreds of thousands of weavers\
  \ and artisans migrate to other southern parts of India. That fascinating and familiar\
  \ piece of information, prodded me to unravel the mystery of my roots. \nIdentical\
  \ to a pesky tourist, I interrogated my guide about the whereabouts of the clan.\
  \ He stated with affirmation, \u201CThe clan, mostly weavers and traders dispersed\
  \ like a puff of smoke but their temple is situated nearby and you could beseech\
  \ the office holders for information.\u201D\nI traversed with my fellows about my\
  \ eurekha moment and snipped some time to visit the temple.  The road slightly diverged\
  \ from the \u2018Bazaar\u2019 side of the town glued to the roots of my beginnings.\
  \ While, I enquired about the clan with the office holders of the temple, they shared\
  \ it with great fervour. With that the unfinished pursuit concluded with a finesse\
  \ touch through sheer serendipity."
