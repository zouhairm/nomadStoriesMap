Text: 'I had been to Sri Lanka, around 15 years back, as my father joined in a textile
  mill in Colombo. I was a school student then. It''s a beautiful city , lots of greenery,
  calm and cozy atmosphere. Whenever my father used to get free, we used to go for
  outings, beaches, hotels, etc. The beaches were beautiful, clean and serene. I my
  sister and brother used to have lots of fun playing in the sands. We loved coconut
  water so much, specially king coconuts. I knew Hindi, Marathi and English as was
  from Mumbai. We tried to interact with locals with some English and some sign language.

  Their local language is Tamil and Sinhala, we also learnt from them few things.
  They were very sweet, helpful and loving people.

  Where my father worked many people became friendly with us. They told us about their
  culture , tradition and festivals, which was really interesting.

  We had lots of fun there and came back with everlasting and fond memories of an
  awesome place and simple yet wonderful people.

  Sri Lanka is mesmerising. I have some memories captured in my heart and Album as
  well. I really wish Thai I could visit again with my children.


  Thank you'
