Text: "The measurement of time has been one of the greatest mysteries for mankind\
  \ ever since the dawn of human history. The exact date of origin of the first mechanical\
  \ clock is\nunknown.  When journeying through such lands of legends, mysteries,\
  \ clans and historic deeds that make up Scotland; the traveler is often met with\
  \ a thick fog which envelops its arid lands, cliffs, lakes,wild vegetation, inhospitable\
  \ castles, legendary abbeys, churches and historic cities. There is noplace like\
  \ Scotland to perceive that strange feeling of time having stopped. From Rosslyn\
  \ castleand its clock dating back to 1596 or its Templar chapel (famous for its\
  \ appearance in the film,The Da Vinci Code) or to the Fife coast, home to some of\
  \ the most picturesque villages in the country, the traveler will be able to enjoy\
  \ the harmonious sound of clocks announcing, as they have done for centuries, that\
  \ the working day has finished.\n\nDavie Weir of \u201CH.E. Weir & Son\u201D, one\
  \ of the most prestigious companies dedicated to the repair and maintenance of mechanical\
  \ clocks in Scotland, invites us to visit the inner side of one of these secret\
  \ and obscure places. We step inside the tower of Mannofield church in Aberdeen,\
  \ founded in1882. Constructed in a neo-Gothic style, the tower features a four-faced\
  \ clock. The cubicle, which is accessed by a Gestalt staircase, reminds us we have\
  \ travelled far into the past. Looking through the four-faced temporal spheres allows\
  \ us to discover an enigmatic and unusual perspective of the city. The clock towers\
  \ were perfect locations for surveillance during the wars, for crowning fortresses\
  \ and for housing arquebuses in defence of the faith. \n\nEdinburgh becomes an obligatory\
  \ stop during our voyage through time. Here the clocks rise over the facades of\
  \ the majestic mansions, the old schools and the temples. The splendid clock of\
  \ the stately Balmoral Hotel \u2013 showing the exact same time since 1902 or The\
  \ Canongate Tolbooth in the heart of The Royal Mile, a distinctive medieval building,\
  \ its clock is a favourite for tourist photographs; or the Millennium Clock Tower\
  \ at the National Museum of Scotland, a contemporary timepiece which contains fragments\
  \ of the story of the millennium.\n\nGlasgow is our final stop. A city that, with\
  \ a glorious industrial past  will delight clocks lovers. We start our tour in the\
  \ Merchant City at the Tolbooth Steeple, an old tower with a blue clock and stone\
  \ crown, built in 1627. The rest of the building was destroyed during the Second\
  \ World War. The Tolbooth provided the backdrop to many of the city\u2019s dramas\
  \ and it was here that witches, thieves and murderers were summarily dealt with.\
  \ Just opposite the Tollbooth on Trongate is the clock steeple, built in 1484. We\
  \ can\u2019t conclude our visit without a walk through one of the city\u2019s architectural\
  \ gems, Central Station. The train station features a spectacular Victorian fa\xE7\
  ade which was built in 1879. The composition, set in an interior combined with a\
  \ modernistic iron and glass structure. Of course, don\u2019t forget to take a look\
  \ at the precious modernist clock. It has functioned as a meeting point for young\
  \ lovers for generations and serves as a testimony to the passing of time. It\u2019\
  s time to take the train back home but our time travel never ends. Only travellers\
  \ arrive at their destinations. They can also survive in memory, in narrative or\
  \ in the centuries old sound of a clock which reminds us that it is time to depart.\n\
