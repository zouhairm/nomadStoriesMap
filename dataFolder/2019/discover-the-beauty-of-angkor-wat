Text: "\"See Angkor Wat, and die,\" said a traveller that I met in Bangkok, Thailand,\
  \ in 2013. He try to convince me to keep continue my travelling to Siem Reap, Cambodia.\
  \ \nSiem Reap is a town where we can find Angkot Wat, a huge buddhist temple that\
  \ is founded in 12 AD. \nFor me, as Indonesian, Angkor Wat is special because the\
  \ design of that temple is almost similar to Borobudur and Prambanan temple. Some\
  \ historian have suggested that Angkor has close relationship to Syailendra Dinasty,\
  \ a Javanese Kingdom who take control all the kingdom in South East Asia in 7 AD.\n\
  To get rich experience, I am travelling from Bangkok to Siem Reap by small bus.\
  \ Each passenger charge 700 Baht or roughly 20 US Dollar for round trip Bangkok-Siem\
  \ Reap. \nThe distance from Bangkok to Siem Reap almost 410 kilometers, it take\
  \ 12 hours travelling by bus or car. So, bring some bread and drink during that\
  \ trip. \nAlong that trip, we only stop three times. Start form Bangkok, the small\
  \ bus will pick up us in the morning, around 7 AM. First, the small bus will stop\
  \ at a restaurant, a few kilometer before Thailand-Cambodia border in Poipet. In\
  \ that restaurant we can take a rest for awhile, do stretching or wash face. If\
  \ we need something to eat, we can order fried rice or french fries in that restaurant.\n\
  Second stop is in Poipet, the border area. We should go out from small bus, take\
  \ a walk about 400 meters to the imigration office. Since i am Indonesian, a part\
  \ of ASEAN community, I can get Cambodia Visa for free. That visa only allow me\
  \ for travelling purpose and limited in 30 days. \nAfter pass the imigration, travelling\
  \ continue by local bus. We don't need to pay more because that local bus service\
  \ include in 700 Baht for round trip Bangkok-Siem Reap. All we have to do just show\
  \ our ticket to the bus driver.\nAlong the trip from Poipet to Siem Reap, we can\
  \ see paddy or rice field at right and left of the street. The villages look so\
  \ far away from the street. \nBefore dawn, the bus stop at a restaurant, as the\
  \ third stop, for take a rest or have some meal.\nAround 08.00 PM, the bus arrive\
  \ in bus terminal in Siem Reap. There will be many Tuk-Tuk driver offer the ride\
  \ to hotel. In 2013, I didn't see any public transportation. So Tuk-Tuk, a kind\
  \ of rickshaw, is the best choice for travelling to hotel. \nIts common the tuk-tuk\
  \ driver will offer us a ride to Angkor Wat Temple for tommorow morning. That ride\
  \ ussualy include the trip to other temple and restaurant, for 7 hours trip. It\
  \ cost around 20-25 US Dollar for 3-4 passengers. Make a bargain to get best price.\
  \ \nThen we should wake up in the early morning to reach the Angkor Wat temple.\
  \ So we will not missed the sunrise. \nThe colour of the sun in the morning really\
  \ beautiful. It will rise right at the back of temple. As the sun rise up, we will\
  \ get the silhouette of Angkor Wat temple. It is the right time to take picture\
  \ of Angkor Wat in the morning. \nTake a walk to explore the temple. See the relief\
  \ of temple, and witness the huge stones are entirely composed for wall and the\
  \ roof of the temple. \nA few places in that temple still use as worship area. We\
  \ can meet monks walk in the temple, and light up the incense. See their activity\
  \ give some peace inside our heart. \nSince temple area very huge, dont hesitate\
  \ to continue our explore to other temples. One of theme are covered by banyan trees.\
  \ Besides the surrounding really calm and surrounded by big trees. \nThe travelling\
  \ to Angkor Wat is not witness history sites, but also find the local people honor\
  \ their ancestor and God."
