Text: "That inexplicable feeling, I\u2019ll never forget it. The moon lit up the sea\
  \ and every ripple sparkled under its candescent warmth. The stars so clear you\
  \ could see nebula clustered together as you looked upward into infinite time. I\
  \ always find stars humbling to look at. Driving through the Great Ocean Road, Australia\
  \ with five of my best friends, I smiled, fire in our eyes, knowing that we had\
  \ never felt freedom quite like it. Away from smothering clouds and dinge of London,\
  \ we had no destination, just a love for the journey we were on. The roads along\
  \ the cliffs twisted and dived and the cool sea air flowed through the open windows\
  \ and breathed calmness into our minds. We spent weeks like this, exploring Sydney,\
  \ Melbourne, Adelaide and everything in- between, purposefully lost in our own sense\
  \ of adventure. \n\nAfter about a month, we decided to visit Uluru. We were flying\
  \ over the baron red sands of the outback when I realised I had no point of reference\
  \ to how high up we were, no trees and no house. Abruptly we touched down in Alice\
  \ Springs airport, which wasn\u2019t really an airport as such, more a large garden\
  \ shed. We piled into the small mini bus, greeted by our enigmatic and energetic\
  \ guide. We drove over three hundred miles but eventually stopped for the night\
  \ and the red heat began to give way to the evening chill, we pulled out our \u2018\
  swags\u2019 - these were sleeping bags with a soft mattress inside. But, before\
  \ we could sleep we were urged to draw a line in the sand circling our swag. The\
  \ line was to deter passing snakes, which would feel the groove on their skin and\
  \ change direction. \n\nForcing my eyes open at 4am, I see our tour guide had already\
  \ packed the mini bus and we set off for Uluru. As the light of morning reared its\
  \ head I began to see the bold silhouette of Uluru, the dark twilight blues began\
  \ to morph into lighter azures layered on top of the deep orange promise of morning.\
  \ No one had said a word for the last fifteen minutes, we were fixated on this rock.\
  \ It had a special kind of aura about it. \n\nAn aura that only grew the closer\
  \ you got. It was as if it had its own heartbeat. Later that day, the heavens opened.\
  \ The guide told us it hadn\u2019t rained for months but we were now witnessing\
  \ waters cascading down the cliff face creating nourishing waterfalls and small\
  \ pools underneath. Thunder rocked our feet as the heartbeat of Uluru grew fierce.\
  \ Lighting electrified our surroundings, magnifying the beauty. My palms began to\
  \ sweat, and my heart began to pound in sync with Uluru. I felt the magic of the\
  \ rock that day and I still feel the magic of the memories with my friends. \n\n\
  One of my friends on that trip was Olivia. A pure ball of energetic sunshine and\
  \ life. Sadly, she passed away last year and will now be forever young. But when\
  \ I think of her, I think of the joy we shared and the stars we shared on that road\
  \ trip though Melbourne, Sydney, Adelaide and Uluru. Those moments of pure bliss\
  \ that we shared will never die and her look of excitement will always be woven\
  \ into the fabric of who I am. Because memories are all we have. They are all we\
  \ ever have."
