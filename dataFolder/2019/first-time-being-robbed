Text: "After years believing the luck was by my side, this experience changed the\
  \ way I look.\n\nI was living in Playa del Carmen, Mexico. It was my third month\
  \ there already and I felt very confident about the way how the city works.\n\n\
  My place was kinda far from the famous 5th Avenue (the most touristic street in\
  \ Playa del Carmen), but only far if we consider it\u2019s not a big big city.\n\
  \nMy catalan friend were in town for a couple nights, since he was on his way to\
  \ Belize, so we decided to meet and have a beer together.\n\nAfter a fun night,\
  \ I walked me friend to his hostel and I went to take a taxi just outside of the\
  \ famous club: Coco Bongo.\n\nI asked two taxi drivers how would it cost me to get\
  \ to my house, but I didn\u2019t take them, cause I thought it was too much (what\
  \ a stupid decision I made).\n\nSo, the third taxi driver I asked to take me home,\
  \ gave a reasonable price and I took a sit right next to the driver.\n\nI told my\
  \ address and i didn\u2019t feel anything, until the taxi stops and pick up another\
  \ man who was apparently going somewhere in the middle between where we were and\
  \ my place.\n\nI felt awkward, but in Mexico they use to do that. They take more\
  \ people if they\u2019re going on the same direction.\n\nIt was all kinda good,\
  \ but I started to feel weird and uncomfortable while the time were running.\n\n\
  It was 8 blocks before my place\u2019s street when the car turns and took another\
  \ direction, while the driver were saying to me that the guy behind me were going\
  \ around the corner and then I\u2019d be home.\n\nI already knew it was very weird\
  \ what it was going on, but I didn\u2019t react and I kept my faith on my \u201C\
  nothing happens experience\u201D.\n\nIt was so quick, but suddenly I saw me being\
  \ choked by the man behind me (a very big and fat man). I was being choked until\
  \ the point I couldn\u2019t breath or even talk.\n\nI saw me dying and being dropped\
  \ somewhere in Playa. I felt like I was passing out, until the driver started telling\
  \ the guy to stop or I\u2019d die.\n\nThat\u2019s when the man stopped and I realized\
  \ the driver had taken all my stuff and he was asking for my debit card code, which,\
  \ because of the shock, i couldn\u2019t remember.\n\nFor some reason, that card\
  \ never worked in Mexico, even when I had used it before in Europe or some other\
  \ countries in Latin America. And I was trying to explain that to him, but he was\
  \ so angry.\n\n\u201CIf it doesn\u2019t work, I\u2019ll kill you right now\u201D\
  , he yelled.\n\nTo the man behind me: \u201Cgive me the gun\u201D.\n\nAt that point,\
  \ I could remember the code and I gave it to him.\n\nIt was then when he told me\
  \ to go out of the car and lay on the ground. When I heard that, I thought: \u201C\
  if I lay on the ground, this would be much worse than now; I\u2019m not doing that\u201D\
  .\n\nI went out of the car and started running to the opposite direction the car\
  \ was going. I didn\u2019t know where I was and what they were going to do, but\
  \ they just left very fast with all my stuff.\n\nI was so scared that they were\
  \ following me. I just ran fast until I realized where I was. I kept running and\
  \ running, almost crying.\n\nFortunately I made it home, where my girlfriend had\
  \ to see me arriving and started crying as I hardly do. I couldn\u2019t even speak\
  \ and explain what happened, but after that I was scared of every taxi for a lot\
  \ of time.\n\nMy perception of life and people changed a lot, but that didn\u2019\
  t stop me traveling. We traveled for 5 more months after that, but I started to\
  \ doubt of everyone.\n\nRight now I just started a new trip in Scandinavia and I\
  \ really appreciate the safety this countries give you. Anyways, it\u2019s all part\
  \ of the adventure."
