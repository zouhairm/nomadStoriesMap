Text: "Travelling by train is always a good idea, right? You can make new friends\
  \ while travelling by train, right? Second class is similar to first class, right?\
  \ The only difference is the price and that there are four people in a berth instead\
  \ of two. I\u2019m still not sure how I got convinced with this advice from my aunt,\
  \ because she was not travelling with us.\nBut yet I found myself late afternoon\
  \ at the departing platform of Baku train station in Azerbaijan. More people were\
  \ gathering on the platform to leave the oil rich country of Azerbaijan for Georgia.\
  \ I started talking with two Polish girls backpacking through the bygone Russian\
  \ territories. This made me believe for a moment that you can make new acquaintances\
  \ and friends while on a train. If they were the other two people sharing your compartment\
  \ as well.   The rest of the stark platform, not yet being renovated for the Euro\
  \ Games arriving in a few months, was also filled with Russians, Turks, Azerbaijanis\
  \ and adventure struck tourists moving out of this country. But no one minds, because\
  \ Baku doesn\u2019t need tourists. It is a wealthy place.  Currently the fastest\
  \ growing economy in the world, exclusively from oil revenues. At the turn of the\
  \ twentieth century, Azerbaijani oil was gushing from onshore wells, but now it\
  \ is mainly offshore, in the Caspian Sea, so that deep water oil rig specialists\
  \ had to be brought in from Britain and the United States.\nThus entering our four\
  \ bed compartment, I spotted the crisp clean linen provided in a sealed plastic\
  \ bag. At least second class had decent bedding. But we were still unsure about\
  \ our other travel companions for the night. Two short, bearded men in their thirties\
  \ peered into our compartment. Then they were out again. Rechecking their tickets\
  \ and calling the train conductor for confirmation. \u201CRussian? Turkish?\u201D\
  \  \u201CNo, English.\u201D  So two South African women sat awkwardly across from\
  \ two Turkish men, unsure how the next 12 hours with border crossings will turn\
  \ out. None of us said much. Not so much from shock of the situation, but rather\
  \ because we could not understand any Turkish or Russian, and they had little understanding\
  \ for any English. \nOur companions started their journey by stocking up on Vodka\
  \ at all the stops and stands on the dark platforms during the night. An unofficial\
  \ national drink of the Balkans. In Supermarkets there are more varieties than soda\
  \ drinks and can even being bought by the meter! Then there is also the home-brewed\
  \ vodka, potent to a novice drinker like myself, who is rather used to mixing vodka\
  \ into cocktails with juice. But when I asked a local about drinking vodka, he was\
  \ disgusted at the idea of even adding a flavor like juice to this transparent liquid.\
  \ \u201CJuice? Why juice? Vodka is not a colddrink.\u201D\nWaking up (somewhere\
  \ in the night, as we have not yet reached the border of Georgia) in the heated\
  \ compartment, our travel companions had too much home-brewed liquid and could not\
  \ get unto their bunk beds. And as a good roommate would, being half asleep and\
  \ disorientated, I gave him a push into bed to sleep off his alcohol stupor. But\
  \ I forgot that with a deep alcoholic sleep, snoring is usually an accomplish. Thus\
  \ whenever I put the bright shining light of the one by two meter compartment on,\
  \ he would stop snoring and I would be awake by the daylight in this confined space.\
  \ And when I switched the light off, the snoring would continue. \nIt was a long,\
  \ hot and noisy night until we reached the first border post after the sun started\
  \ rising. Our companions eyed us with guilt about the night before and left our\
  \ compartment only to return with warm tea to make amends. No food or beverages\
  \ are sold on the overnight train, so they sweet talked a Russian conductor for\
  \ glasses of sweet black tea. And before reaching Tbilisi, we were already communicating\
  \ and making a connection between random words of Russian, Turkish and English.\
  \ And somehow language was no longer a barrier and we could understand each other\
  \ over a glass of sweet tea."
