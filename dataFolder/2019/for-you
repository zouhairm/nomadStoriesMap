Text: "The windscreen wipers dragged across the glass, barely leaving a clear view\
  \ on to the rainy streets ahead. I was sitting \u2018shotgun\u2019 in a 1957 Buick\
  \ driving through the suburbs of Havana. Next to me; a man, a (new) friend that\
  \ I had met only hours earlier. Staring out of the window, watching people run from\
  \ the sudden tropical downpour I have a little chuckle to myself as I reflect on\
  \ how I ended up here in the first place.\n\nI was at the tail end of a three week\
  \ bicycle trip in Cuba. I had planned to spend my last few days wandering aimlessly\
  \ around the capital city with camera in hand. I was doing exactly that when I first\
  \ met Osbanis. He was standing in a doorway, quietly watching the world go by. A\
  \ large man with a slicked back pony tail and dark sunglasses. Noticing he was wearing\
  \ a Metallica t-shirt, not your average Cuban attire, I struck up a conversation.\n\
  \n\u201CMe gusta el heavy metal\u201D\n\n\u201CHa! Yo tambi\xE9n\u201D \n\nEagerly\
  \ he explained his love for rock n\u2019roll. Stating that people in Cuba only listen\
  \ to salsa and jazz and although he appreciated those genres he only listened to\
  \ rock music. We laughed. After introducing myself, we continued to chat as I snapped\
  \ a few portraits of him. Despite the language barrier, our mutual curiosity for\
  \ each other made conversation easy. I told him of my love for photography and adventure.\
  \ But, it wasn\u2019t until I mentioned baseball and my plans to watch Industriales\
  \ (arguably Cuba\u2019s most popular team) play that evening that his eyes really\
  \ lit up. Before I knew it I had been invited in to his home, introduced to his\
  \ mother and I was sitting down with a freshly made coffee.  Their home, along an\
  \ alleyway inside a dilapidated colonial building, consisted of two rooms. One up\
  \ and one down with a wooden ladder connecting the two. I hadn\u2019t noticed Osbanis\
  \ sneak off as I looked through picture albums with his mother but suddenly he returned\
  \ dressed head to toe in the royal blue uniform of his favourite baseball team \u2018\
  Los Industriales'. He wanted to make sure that I knew he was their number one fan\
  \ and that it would be his honour to take me to the game with him. How could I say\
  \ no to that? \n\nReturning later that afternoon, wearing (as requested) as much\
  \ blue clothing as possible, I was once again invited in to Osbanis' home. This\
  \ time we climbed the ladder upstairs as he wanted to show me his music. In true\
  \ Cuban style, his music was stored on a mismatched 1980's style computer with an\
  \ electric fan pointed directly at the hard drive to avoid over heating. He proudly\
  \ scrolled through countless American and British rock albums that he had acquired\
  \ by purchasing black market thumb drives. Excusing himself, my new friend started\
  \ to rummage through a cardboard box in the corner of the room. Finding what he\
  \ was looking for he sat down and handed me something. I was amazed to see an antique\
  \ Kodak camera. It was truly something special. After admiring it for a while I\
  \ went to hand it back to him. \n\n\"No. For you!\"\n\nAt first, I didn't want to\
  \ take the camera. But, not wanting to offend him, I accepted Osbanis' gift. I could\
  \ see it made him very happy. Soon after, it was time to leave for the game. Saying\
  \ goodbye to his mother, she asked if I had any siblings. Telling her that I had\
  \ an older sister she quickly handed me a handmade headband as a present for her\
  \ and a bag to carry my new gifts in. Again, I was blown away.\n\nAs I sat there,\
  \ in the car, on the way to the baseball game I found myself reflecting on the generosity\
  \ of the Cuban people. As so often is the case the people who have the least, give\
  \ the most. Osbanis did not want anything in return for the camera or taking me\
  \ to the baseball game. He did it out of pure benevolence. In that moment I knew\
  \ I had made a true connection."
