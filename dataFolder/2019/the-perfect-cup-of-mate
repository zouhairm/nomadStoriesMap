Text: "\"See, you fill the gourd up to here,\" he said, pointing as he shook the yerba\
  \ into the cup. I watched my host father flip the spout on his thermos and pour\
  \ hot water over the herbs, stirring it lightly. \"Then you wait.\" Steam rose up,\
  \ swirling lightly in the breeze that blew through the garden as he held it out\
  \ for me to hold.\n\t\"For how long?\" I asked, inspecting the carved gourd and\
  \ its strange silver straw. \n\t\"Until its ready, \" he replied simply, relaxing\
  \ into his patio chair as he let the herbs steep. He gazed up at the canopy of trees\
  \ and stars above him. From behind us came the sound of rustling leaves followed\
  \ by the thump of a mango falling to the ground. He didn't even turn to look.\n\t\
  I sat in silence with him, taking in my host family's garden. Nearly every plant\
  \ was unfamiliar to me, from the closed flowers that bloomed purple during the day\
  \ to the tall tree in the corner of the yard, coated in a thick layer of green spikes.\
  \ Outside the front gate, leaves shook and another mango fell, splattering on the\
  \ street.\n\tAfter a moment, my host father flipped open his thermos again, gesturing\
  \ for the cup. I held it out as he poured a little more water over the yerba. He\
  \ inspected the drink and then nodded for me to try it, satisfied with his work.\
  \ I took a sip, the bitter taste coating my tongue.\n\tI must have made a face because\
  \ he laughed a little. \"I know, it's hard to get used to.\" He reached to pick\
  \ up a paper bag from the ground. \"That's how the Paraguayans drink it,\" he began,\
  \ taking  the gourd back from me. \"But where I grew up in Argentina, we always\
  \ liked our mate a little sweet.\"\n\tI watched as he heaped a spoonful of sugar\
  \ into the cup, stirring it again with the bombilla and letting it settle.\n\t\"\
  Try it again,\" he suggested.\n \tI tasted it a second time, instantly surprised.\
  \ With a simple bit of sugar the bitter tea had transformed into something much\
  \ more pleasant.\n\t\"Que rico, verdad? Sometimes all you need is a little change\
  \ to make something better.\"\n\tHe was right. I finished the cup, refilling it\
  \ with hot water and handing it back to my host father. In my time in Paraguay's\
  \ capital, I had often seen the ritual of mate. It was a social act: Drink, refill,\
  \ pass, repeat. I had witnessed it almost daily but had never really understood\
  \ the process let alone participated in it.\n\tWe sat there for a long while, passing\
  \ the mate gourd as we exchanged stories from the places we grew up. From me, it\
  \ was tales of cactus and summer dust storms. From him, it was talk of the bustling\
  \ streets of Buenos Aires. Sometimes, it was hard for me to remember that Paraguay\
  \ was foreign to him too. He called it home now, but for a long time it must have\
  \ felt just as strange as it now did to me.\n\tBehind us, the leaves rustled again\
  \ followed by an ever more familiar thump. I didn't glance back as a mango rolled\
  \ slowly to our feet. My host father picked it up and brushed it off, turning it\
  \ over in his hands.\n\t\"This one's perfect,\" he declared, \"We can have it for\
  \ breakfast tomorrow.\" He stood, tucking the mango under one arm as he gathered\
  \ his mate supplies. \"Come on, let's get inside. It's getting late.\"\n\tI nodded\
  \ at him, finishing the last bit of mate. I took a last glance at the garden with\
  \ its tropical plants and high canopy of leaves. What was once so unfamiliar to\
  \ me was starting to feel more and more like home. From somewhere nearby came the\
  \ thud of a mango. I smiled. Just like with mate, I was beginning to better understand\
  \ Paraguay. In the end, all I had needed was a spoonful of sugar to make it just\
  \ a little sweeter."
