Text: "Dubai!!  The very first time when I walked out of that airport I felt a vibe\
  \ which I never felt before. Took a cab to get to the hotel, by the time I reached\
  \ the hotel I already had met people from three different countries with different\
  \ culture but they all had one thing or say feeling in common. \n\nWalking around\
  \ I realized its a beautiful looking concrete jungle with so many dreams, millions\
  \ and millions of dreams. The food, the parties, the streets they're all mesmerizing\
  \ to the eyes.  \n\nOne side of the city is called old Dubai and the other is new\
  \ ( no guesses there, yeah?) it's a lot of difference on the both sides. On one\
  \ side we have all the hardworking people with less wages on the other we have posh\
  \ buildings with people taking heavy amounts. I mean that's everywhere now Cmon!\
  \  But that's the beauty of the city you need best of both the worlds to live a\
  \ content life. \n\nTo get around we have metro running up and down and cabs going\
  \ here there with a lot of interesting cabbies to have conversations with and understand\
  \ their struggles and day to day activities. \n\nDubai has the most busiest airports\
  \ in the world.  The number of transits are as crazy as it can get.  They also have\
  \ different terminal for emirates which is no less that a five star.  I think I\
  \ can stay it confidently that I can smell gold and Money here in the city.  \n\n\
  Talking about meeting people I've made few solid friendships here, to begin with\
  \ I met a few bangaloreans ( that's where I'm from) hung out with them and had lots\
  \ to drink and barbeque nights in the heart of marina. Tatenda madzorera who is\
  \ extremely handsome lad from Zimbabwe who graduated from hult Business School London,\
  \ is very charming also you can say I almost fell in love with him but ya he's a\
  \ very good friend of mine. I mean he's so well behaved and oh my! Anyway I need\
  \ to shush about tate.  Next one is happy who is always smiling she's from Tanzania,\
  \ really helpful. Jamie from London, a PE teacher who is hilarious. Bilal from Algeria,\
  \ umar from azerbejan, Anna and Roma from Ukraine I mean they're all such nice people.\
  \ This is one of the best part about traveling. \n\nAll working and chilling and\
  \ running around and all the hustle Bustle, the vibe like I said before made me\
  \  fall in love with the city, i also visited Abu Dhabi and Al ain but Dubai is\
  \ my favorite. Coming back to the thing or the feeling I said which is in common\
  \ is emptiness, loneliness. They're all like machines even with the things they\
  \ do on the weekends are the same.  They're all the same, very same.  Emptiness\
  \ emptiness emptiness. \n\nDeserted hearts just like the deserts in the city. I\
  \ hope people learn something from the water from the sun which is different and\
  \ from the lights on the buildings it's all very enterprising and motivating.  I\
  \ wish people would become a little accepting of things. \n\nBut all in all Dubai\
  \ is a lovely place, extremely safe and beautiful vibe. I'd love to live there for\
  \ a good part of my life.  \n\nDubai  \u2764\uFE0F\uFE0F"
