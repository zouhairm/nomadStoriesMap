Text: Alot of police harrasment in my community for years towards minorities has me
  wondering if people in other countries face the same adversary we Americans face
  when it comes down to thin blue line between black an white. I've always been a
  keen person who pays attention to everyone an everything so as a natural explorer
  an wanderer this is a topic that I cant seem to get away from as I notice it in
  almost every an any city or town I visit. This is a important topic plagueing human
  kind more than most people know. What is  the impact on over policing stereotypical
  cops harassing the innocent kids an not actually catching the "bad guys". Believe
  it or not more often then not we keep hearing them story after story of who these
  "policemen" really are an there backgrounds arent "pretty" as one would say, an
  no I dont mean the policeman who grow up in a bad neighborhood an understands directly
  what the community needs an acts on that thought in a positive manner, but I'm talking
  about the policemen who are "white supremacists' an "kkk" members who mask themselves
  behind a false sense of reality an try to give there life some type of narcissistic
  meaning by hiding there I'll intentions with a badge an abusing there power. These
  "particular humans" are in the dark not because noones trying hard enough to find
  them an put them in the spotlight to be tried just as they do to our innocent minority
  men an women, but no there in the dark because as soon as someone shines the spotlight
  on them they shoot whoever's pointing the spotlight at em down "literally" whether
  your filming them with yourphone or trying to communicate verbally "they" dont want
  to hear it an not only will they smash the spotlight to pieces they will make adjustments
  so they aren't caught next time if they get away with it the first time. Not only
  does this topic fuel me to travel an experience new places an cultures but it gives
  me passion an meaning knoing I can help educate people to be more aware consciously
  of the environment they are really born into as most people are not untill that
  lack of knowledge becomes there downfall. As the old saying goes who really "polices
  the police"?
