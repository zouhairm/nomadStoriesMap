Text: "In this local park, I sat idly under an enormous oak tree watching as a whirlwind\
  \ whisked across the rolling hills of the meadow.  As it passed by me, the whirlwind\
  \ scooped up a dormant pile of dead leaves lying next to the oak tree.  The leaves\
  \ appeared to come alive twisting, turning, and dancing about the meadow where a\
  \ blue sky sets the backdrop.\n\nMy park has a wonderful lake running through it\
  \ with yellow flowers speckled throughout the base of the lake while lush green\
  \ grass grows all around.  In the park you see birds flying through the radiant\
  \ blue sky diving for insects; white ducks swimming in the lake searching for their\
  \ next meal; and families really enjoying themselves. The sounds of the meadow complement\
  \ the beautiful environment, and create a sense of inner peace and harmony.  \n\
  The soothing sounds drifted across the meadow like an orchestra playing at Carnegie\
  \ Hall.  The buzzing of the bees feeding on pollen made up the chorus. A woodpecker\
  \ kept a steady beat as he drilled a hole in the oak tree.  Birds whistling and\
  \ peeping formed the brass section like trumpets playing an excerpt from an overture.\
  \  All these sounds blended together to create a relaxing melody soothing to the\
  \ ear. \n\nHowever, as the day wore on, a storm in the distance began to approach\
  \ the park.  A freezing chill came over my body as crisp breeze whisked over the\
  \ meadow.  The sun had passed behind the clouds as the sky became dark gray.  Small\
  \ raindrops had started to come down. The green grass was now completely covered\
  \ with a fine mist of water droplets.  It was time to gather my belongings and depart\
  \ this lovely environment. Fortunately, my home was only a short hop away where\
  \ I sought shelter from this swiftly moving storm."
