Text: "My travel story starts with one big decision: to leave the comfort zone and\
  \ try something new. So I applied for an Erasmus scholarship in Rijeka, Croatia.\
  \ At that time I did not know anything about this city. \n   I was accepted and\
  \ I had a few months to prepare myself for this experience. I started to inform\
  \ myself about Rijeka. I found out that Rijeka it\u2019s the principal seaport and\
  \ third largest city in Croatia.\n    Time passed quickly and I have arrived in\
  \ Rijeka. Next morning I went out to walk alone in my new city. I wandered on the\
  \ streets. Konzo street get me to the city center. There is the city clock tower.\
  \ \n     My next stops was Nikola Hosta park. There you can be surrounded by nature\
  \ even if you are in town. You can relax yourself with a good book.\n     If you\
  \ want to have a panoramic view of the entire city you have to visit Trsat castle.\
  \  \n     The best experience I had in this town was Rijeka Carnival. It takes place\
  \ every year from the end of February to  third of March. On the last day of the\
  \ carnival there is a parade. The city become full of life. People are walking on\
  \ the streets, singing and dancing. This eveniment it\u2019s a must have if you\
  \ are visiting the city. \n     Now I\u2019m in Croatia for almost 2 weeks. Every\
  \ day I discover something new and I learn more about culture of this city.  I\u2019\
  m happy that I\u2019m here, that I can see every day a sunset near the port. \n\
  While I\u2019m here I want to visit more Croatian cities. Opatija will be my next\
  \ destination, because it\u2019s very close to Rijeka, and a tourist place. I\u2019\
  m trying to enjoy this experience and be a traveler, not a tourist."
