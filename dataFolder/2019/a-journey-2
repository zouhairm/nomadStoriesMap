Text: "The world is a vast place that can shape one's life in ways that may not have\
  \ been expected. The rolling waves of the ocean lulled me to sleep every night.\
  \ I learned about cultures I never heard about and made life long friends. I lived\
  \ a busy life, full of hard work and I loved it. Working on a cruise ship was one\
  \ of the most fulfilling things I have ever done. It is said that it is not the\
  \ destination, but the journey that makes the trip. \n\nI started off in a small\
  \ town in New Jersey.  I had studied in New York City and London to obtain the right\
  \ credentials to work on a ship. There was a lot of effort and dedication to getting\
  \ this job, and it paid off. I got hired and was flown to London for training, and\
  \ I even had to go to sea survival. I went from London to the Isle of Wight in February.\
  \ The training involved me having to jump into a freezing river to help others into\
  \ a life raft, and even put out blazing fires with a team. If I were asked a year\
  \ before this what I would be doing, I would not be able to predict that it would\
  \ involve wet suits."
