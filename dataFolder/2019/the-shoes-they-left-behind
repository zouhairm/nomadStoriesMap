Text: "The soles of hundreds of people lined the wall. They were dusty, flattened\
  \ or ripped apart, tongues hanging out and eyelets empty of laces. There were hundreds\
  \ of them from baby to adult size found buried deep in the earth. They are the shoes\
  \ that the Roman Army left behind over 1,500 years ago at the site of Vindolanda\
  \ along Hadrian\u2019s Wall. I had chosen to follow in their footsteps but did not\
  \ imagine carrying the weight of this shoe excavation with me on my walk.\n\nI began\
  \ to imagine the men, women and children huddled within the walls of this fort as\
  \ war raged on outside of it between the British tribes and Roman Army.  As I trekked\
  \ the story of Hadrian\u2019s Wall, my journey took me through lush hillsides filled\
  \ with purple lavender flowers and bleating sheep, majestic cathedrals and ancient\
  \ crumbling ruins. I discovered excavation sites filled with iron masks used to\
  \ shield the face from sharply carved lances. Eroding swords and arrowheads, mixed\
  \ with leather saddles and horse harnesses. These were all artifacts of centuries\
  \ of battles.\n\nAlong with signs of war, came more signs of life. Carved stone\
  \ statues recovered from shrines dedicated to gods told a story of people seeking\
  \ the divine. Crumbling pieces of farming tools, vast quantities of pottery, the\
  \ skeletal remains of domestic pets and a recent discovery of writing tablets revealed\
  \ the community life that carried on inside the safety of the forts.\n\nEach step\
  \ of my 83 mile (ca.134 km) hike through the North Umbrian countryside brought me\
  \ in step with the armed forces and tribes that fought each other here. At every\
  \ fort, tower and milecastle I found myself unconsciously talking in a hushed tone\
  \ as if in respect for the ancient history that had occurred on this land. I was\
  \ dwarfed under the archway of the commander\u2019s homes and stumbled along the\
  \ cobblestone in the center of the fort. I saw the ghosts of people living within\
  \ the faded and eroding stone walls. I could picture the woman cooking in the now\
  \ crumbling fireplace, the child asleep in a wooden cradle near her and the soldier\
  \ in the tower on the hill.\n\nI had been drawn to walk Hadrian\u2019s Wall for\
  \ its war history and beautiful remote countryside. I hadn't been prepared to discover\
  \ the people in the shoes that were left behind."
