Text: "You get on a plane and leave your life behind.\n\nIt is like reading a book\
  \ that you never want to finish even though you are with the thrill to know the\
  \ end. but in this case, you are not... You touch every page, back and forth and\
  \ feel how every bit of it may never come back or be the same as it is now.\n\n\
  What is this place where I live? You laugh because you have everything back home,\
  \ I MEAN EVERYTHING. But this Is worth it, these seconds, these mistakes, these\
  \ people! Oh and the people! You meet plenty of them, and you meet them everywhere.\
  \ Nothing like going alone into a cafe and ending up having the nicest, most fulfilling\
  \ talk with a total stranger who you now feel like you\u2019ve known for a lifetime.\n\
  \nJust walk, walk around, watch around, even sometimes watch out, you never know,\
  \ but you never want to know, because you always want everything to be new and to\
  \ be an experience.\n\nSay hi every morning to the flower guy who sits around the\
  \ corner since 6am and always has a smile on his face. Run to the subway or you\
  \ may not catch the one that leaves at time so you will have to wait for ten or\
  \ fifteen more minutes and you\u2019ll be late, somewhere.\n\nIf you stay longer\
  \ watch the seasons change, from a cold and snowy winter to a bloomy spring, with\
  \ the trees full of green leaves and pink flowers that just will never cease to\
  \ amaze anyone. You just watch them taking pictures as if this was the first spring\
  \ they have ever seen, but that\u2019s how it should be for everyone, isn\u2019\
  t it? To just get excited about a snowflake, a pink flower, a ray of sun, a drop\
  \ of rain, a hug, a kiss, a laugh, a good talk with your friends.\n\nOh and the\
  \ food! There is no better place to eat than Italy! Nobody ever will be able to\
  \ change my mind on that. Eating, drinking, and sharing a nice meal with friends\
  \ is just the best way to end an amazing day. Every bite and sip is enjoyable, and\
  \ no one can deny that when in Italy.\n\nThere where so many trains, planes, buses,\
  \ roads, mountains, landscapes, vineyards, buildings, and they all stay in my heart\
  \ as a once in a lifetime experience, because even if I go back and step on the\
  \ same spot, the moment, not the place, is what counts."
