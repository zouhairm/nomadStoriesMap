Text: "We were there, at one of the highest points in the City of Stone. Maca, a friend\
  \ I recently met abroad, and I. The view was the most amazing I'd ever seen, and\
  \ for a moment I didn't notice the sweat rolling down my cheek or my headscarf falling\
  \ off. \n\nThat instant was so peaceful and perfect. But that's what it was, an\
  \ instant. We didn't have time to seat and enjoy a cup of tea offered by the bedouins,\
  \ not even to blink, otherwise we would miss the three minutes left we had up there\
  \ to admire the beautiful hand-carved wonder in front of us.\n\nAfter an hour of\
  \ climbing the pink stone walls of the lost city, we rode donkeys up, on what seemed\
  \ a ninety degree angled hill, and they managed to balance their skinny legs on\
  \ the steep rocky steps. I felt their hard hair brush my ankles because I was pressing\
  \ so hard to not fall off, I felt terrified, each time we approached a corner I\
  \ closed my eyes so I wouldn't see the ravines, I'd never thought donkeys to be\
  \ so skilled, I was impressed.\n\nWe had one goal in mind and that was to get to\
  \ see the Treasury from the top of the mountains, and we were finally there. \u201C\
  The best view in Petra\u201D according to Bahir, our bedouin guide. After that scary\
  \ hike, it was completely worth it. The feeling that came over me from just being\
  \ there was another level of amazement, a sensation of the present but at the same\
  \ time of a hidden past. It was a feeling I had never experienced so deep before.\
  \ \n\nBut that moment came to an end very fast, we realized we had 30 minutes to\
  \ get back to the entrance on a hike that took us over an hour to achieve, \nif\
  \ the group left without us we would not only miss our plane back home, but we wouldn't\
  \ have where to sleep that night since the closest city was all booked out. Bahir\
  \ told us that if we hurried we would make it in time, and so we started running\
  \ down the stone mountains. I had my camera in one hand, my water bottle in the\
  \ other, and my bag in front of me completely full and about to break. The rocks\
  \ downhill were slippery, but we couldn't slow down if we wanted to make it in time,\
  \ I slipped first and Maca right after me. The heat was intense, we were tired and\
  \ we couldn't see where we were heading, Bahir started telling us about his family\
  \ to keep us calm. He told us he was 21 years old and the oldest of seven children,\
  \ he'd started working as a tourist guide to help support his brothers, and how\
  \ he'd english when the tourism increased once Petra became one of the new Seven\
  \ Wonders of the World in 2007.  \nAfter a while we met Abdul, the bedouin with\
  \ the donkeys, and we got back on track. They told us we would take a shortcut,\
  \ we got on the donkeys and started riding as fast as possible, they were running\
  \ alongside. Maca and I couldn't go fast enough because we didn't know how to ride\
  \ donkeys, so Bahir and Abdul asked if they could ride with us to go faster, now\
  \ that was speed!\nWhile riding, my donkeys knee bent as he stepped on a rock downhill,\
  \ I felt him lose balance and I saw my face closer to the ground. I expected the\
  \ worse, but surprisingly the donkey got up and kept running.\nA few minutes later\
  \ we could see the entrance from afar, for a minute we were relieved. It was still\
  \ far but at least we knew where we were. \nOnce we reached the more touristic area,\
  \ they told us it would be faster if we got off and ran since it was crowded. So\
  \ we did, Maca and I running through the touristic crowds of Petra, giving the last\
  \ of our energies to reach our group in time. \nThree minutes past 17:00. We were\
  \ the first ones in the van."
