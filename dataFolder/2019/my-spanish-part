Text: "January 2018. I was thinking about my university future. I was lost, i was\
  \ bored and i didn't know what to do. I decided to change something, but what it\
  \ could be the first important change? Of course, the country! I decided to move\
  \ to Spain with Erasmus programme and in september 2018 i started this adventure.\
  \ \nThe first months was terrible, i knew no one, i couldn't play basketball ( my\
  \ favourite sport) and spanish teachers weren't close to me. So I started to travel,\
  \ I tried to know everything of spanish culture, because i thought that the best\
  \ way to meet spanish people and to share with them something, it was to be spanish.\
  \ My first travel was Sivilla. I travelled on my own and it was my best choice.\
  \ I slept in an hostal,the first time for me, and I knew some people from Toledo\
  \ and in the night we went out togheter. It was so great! The day after I bought\
  \ a map and i started visiting this amazing city. Immediately i felt in love with\
  \ in: the colours, the temperature, the people. Everything was perfect. It's a city\
  \ in wich Arabic culture and Spanish culture got together to create something superlative.\
  \ \"El alcazar\" for example is one of the best evidence of this cultures' mix.\
  \ It is a royal palace in wich there are a lot of orange trees and myrtle trees,\
  \ a whole of gardens and many fountains and pool, full of dish. The alcazar is a\
  \ whole of colour, it made me so cheerful.\nWhen i got out from the Alcazar I ate\
  \ a \"bocadillo\", a typical sandwich with a glass of \"tinto the verano\", red\
  \ wine with a slice of lemon and glasses. It was a very sunny day and I enjoyed\
  \ the peacefull moment.\nMy curiosity pushed me in discovering all the city, walking\
  \ by the river's side, I could see little unknown places, such as little alleys\
  \ decorated with red and yellow flowers, \"el mercado de Triana\",  wich is a big\
  \ market with typical Spanish products , beautiful gardens and a very nice girl\
  \ singing and dancing Flamenco, the traditional Andalucia's prom... Finally I got\
  \ to \"Plaza de Espana\", the most important Sevilla's square, situated in the Maria\
  \ Luisa's Park. I have no words to tell how was it beautiful. I lokked at it for\
  \ a few minutes without taking photoes or talking. The square is semicircular as\
  \ hugging the Spain, there is a canal that across it, in wich is possile sailing\
  \ with a little boat. The canal is drowned out by four bridges that represent the\
  \ ancient kingdoms. Walking around the square I could see ceramic's benches, blue\
  \ and white, each one has the name of a spanich province. Two big towers frame the\
  \ palace in the center. All the square is trimmed with geometric design themes,\
  \ blue, white, yellow and brown. I love this colours. I immagine that these are\
  \ the colours of the Spain. I spent about two hours visiting the place and all its\
  \ details.\nSevilla has been my first journey on my own and I really enjoyed it.\
  \ I hope I could visit it once again because it stole my heart. I love travelling,\
  \ it makes me very happy and carefree. I feel so relaxed when I discover new places,\
  \ I think that every journey enrich me."
