Text: "Walking the Camino has been imprinted in my head for nearly 20 years. There\
  \ have been moments of optimism, pessimism, clarity, and self doubt. The opportunity\
  \ has always seemed to be just beyond the reach of my outstretched hands, yet all\
  \ along I knew it was I who could take that opportunity and make it a reality. As\
  \ I approached a mile marker in years spent living the life that chose me, I finally\
  \ made the decision to choose the life I want to live. The Camino will no longer\
  \ be something of want, something of thought, and will no longer be the fear of\
  \ regret for never making it happen. At 40, this is the year I immerse myself on\
  \ the trail to Santiago. Millions of perigrinos have walked the way, millions have\
  \ dealt with the fear and pain the Camino imposes on the souls willing to make the\
  \ adventure a reality. Not everyone who begins the path, who makes the effort, who\
  \ saved their money, who planned their time away, will complete the journey. Yet,\
  \ everyone who begins the path will take something from the path in their heart.\
  \ Santiago de Compostela is the destination but it has little to do with the journey.\
  \ Every step that is taken to reach the destination is an imprint on the soul. The\
  \ only fear one should feel is \u201Cwhat happens when I reach the end?\u201D Almost\
  \ two decades have passed where I have mentally prepared myself for this adventure,\
  \ and where I have physically prepared myself for this long walk. The time has come,\
  \ I\u2019ve packed my bag and bought the ticket. It won\u2019t be long until I walk\
  \ the Camino and can finally say, \u201Cwhat next?\u201D"
