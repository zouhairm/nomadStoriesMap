Text: "The dark of the night is all that we had in our path. The sky was blocked by\
  \ the giant trees and the sound of nocturnal animals kept us vigilant. We were tired\
  \ of walking for so many hours in circles, hungry, thirsty and lost. All we could\
  \ see was the shadow of the trees and we walked in a queue to make sure that everybody\
  \ would remain together no matter what.\n\nOne month before this occurrence, I arrived\
  \ in a Guarani village surrounded by the jungle, in the South of Brazil. They thought\
  \ me their customs and their language. In one specific afternoon, a group of locals\
  \ decided to go fishing, but the river they wanted to go was located really far.\
  \ \n\nWe were in five, me and another woman and more three guys. In our walk to\
  \ the river, they showed me how to hunt an iguana and how to get protein eating\
  \ larva of insects that live inside the old trees. In a specific point, we had to\
  \ cross a river, and that is where our first problem came out. We throw to the other\
  \ side of the river the objects we had. swimming to the other side. However, I do\
  \ not know swimming and they had to cut a big bamboo tree with an axe and hold from\
  \ one side to the other. \n\nOne guy stayed in each side of the river holding the\
  \ bamboo and the third waited for me in the middle of the river, in case I drown\
  \ or need help. I crossed to the other side and the woman helped me to get out of\
  \ the water. After that, we had a wonderful end of the day fishing, telling stories\
  \ and laughing. They told me the secrets of the water, how to fish showing respect\
  \ to the aquatic animals and I learnt really fast. We were so distracted that we\
  \ did not see the hours passing. The night came and we tried to get back to the\
  \ village before the darkness takes all the jungle. \n\nWe walked fast, but the\
  \ night was fastest and soon we could not locate the trees that marked the way back\
  \ home. The lights and cellphones we brought with us were without power and we realised\
  \ we were lost. I wanted to pass the night under some tree but they advised me that\
  \ it was too dangerous because of the nocturnal animals that could attack us. \n\
  \nAfter about two hours walking in circles, I could see the sky between the top\
  \ of some trees and remembered that the constelation of Crux marked the south. The\
  \ village was located in the North-East and this way we could find our way back\
  \ home. Not long after, we wore in the village and the locals were really worried\
  \ about me, but I was not scaried. It was exactly the opposite. I was so excited\
  \ about the adventure and pround of myself for getting the higher number of fish\
  \ and being able to help them to find our way back home. They were really happy\
  \ for me too and interested about my asthronomy knowledge. In the end, this experience\
  \ was an exchange of knowledge between them and me. I went to this trip thinking\
  \ that I had no knowledge to use in the jungle or to pass to my Guarani hosts, but\
  \ I left the village with another perception. We all have a lot to learn but everybody\
  \ also has something to give to someone or aplly in some situation."
