Text: "My head is spinning as I stare, mortified, at a pair of my knickers resting\
  \ on the sidewalk of a busy street in Kings Cross. My suitcase has just burst, spilling\
  \ its contents, including an array of fluro-coloured underwear, onto the street.\
  \ I feel my cheeks flush fuchsia, no doubt mirroring the shade of the suitcase I\u2019\
  m desperately trying to squeeze together despite the broken zip. I don\u2019t know\
  \ what I regret more, over packing the thing, or the four too many wines I drank\
  \ on the 32-hour journey from New Zealand to London. \n\nI try to ignore my splitting\
  \ headache, and the noises of car horns and sirens ringing in my ears, as I attempt\
  \ to waddle down the street to my hostel, juggling my broken suitcase and two bags\
  \ \u2013 one slung over each shoulder. I have to stop every few minutes to readjust\
  \ my grip and wipe the sweat that\u2019s accumulated on my brow in this hideous\
  \ 30-degree heat. I\u2019m silently cursing everyone who warned me about the dreary\
  \ British weather, prompting me to dress in jeans and leather boots. \n \nAt no\
  \ point in the past three years of planning my one-way adventure to Europe did I\
  \ ever think I would be here. Hungover, sweaty, and picking my unmentionables out\
  \ of the gutter. A part of me feels as though I may as well have been in that gutter\
  \ myself, next to cigarette butts, chewing gum and a condom wrapper (yes apparently\
  \ some London streets are filthy). \n\nI quit my steady, well-paying job to be here.\
  \ I was full of excitement. I envisioned moving to Italy or Croatia, living the\
  \ rest of my days blissfully with Chianti wine in hand, sporting a constant sun-kissed\
  \ tan and possibly even shacking up with a man who looks like he\u2019s come straight\
  \ off the set of a Moccona coffee ad. But my naivety is now hitting me harder than\
  \ any tequila shot has in all my adult life. What on earth have I done? The question\
  \ won\u2019t leave me as I get to my hostel, change and crawl into my bed, feeling\
  \ defeated.  \n\nI wake the next day and plead with the staff to let me use some\
  \ masking tape to bind up my broken suitcase before I race to the airport for the\
  \ next leg of my journey, Croatia. As the plane nears its destination, I glance\
  \ out of the window at white rocky cliffs and tiny terracotta tiled buildings, all\
  \ surrounded by a giant pool of turquoise water. For the first time on my trip,\
  \ I feel a smile tugging at the corner of my mouth. \n\nI arrive and meet a burly\
  \ taxi driver, maybe in his 60s, whose stony face transforms when he sees me, a\
  \ tourist clearly out of her depth, struggling with all her bags. He greets me with\
  \ a bemused smile. \u201CLong flight?\u201D he asks with a thick accent. I proceed\
  \ to tell him all about my journey, which turns into a long rant about the nightmare\
  \ that was the day before. He stops me midway by pointing to the faint outline of\
  \ a rainbow, above towering city walls carefully crafted on top of a rugged cliff-face.\
  \ The walls are enormous, encircling the cluster of terracotta buildings I spotted\
  \ from the plane earlier. The closer we drove, the more I noticed the spires and\
  \ domes of churches and cathedrals looming over the other buildings, like protective\
  \ older siblings. I suddenly had this giant grin on my face, which made my taxi\
  \ driver chuckle. \u201CYou see there\u2019s no rainbow, without a little rain,\
  \ no?,\u201D he touted in his broken English. I didn\u2019t understand what he meant\
  \ when we arrived at the Airbnb. \n\nLater that afternoon, while strolling through\
  \ the cobbled streets, dark clouds came rolling in. A flock of tourists clad in\
  \ fanny-packs in front of me scuttled to seek shelter, loudly complaining about\
  \ the sudden torrential downpour. I\u2019m soaked within seconds, but I\u2019m fixed\
  \ standing in this medieval city, feeling oddly at ease, and waiting for the rainbow\
  \ to emerge. If only I knew yesterday, that there\u2019s no good without a little\
  \ a bad (or without your knickers landing in the gutter)."
