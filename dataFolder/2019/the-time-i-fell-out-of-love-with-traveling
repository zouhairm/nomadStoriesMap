Text: "My story is about an island named Boracay and how I fell out of love with traveling.\
  \ Boracay island is a famous destination in the Philippines. It is known for its\
  \ fine white sand and clear water. Thousands of visitors from all over the world\
  \ flock to this place to see its beauty each day. \n\nI have learned to appreciate\
  \ the art of traveling at a very young age. I grew up with a mentality that experiences\
  \ are more valuable than material things. As soon as I finished college, it has\
  \ been my yearly goal to go to at least one place I have never been to. But Boracay\
  \ island was different. I have been to her for more than five times. I met her first\
  \ when I was a teenager and ever since, I found home in that island. I have always\
  \ enjoyed visiting her until in 2013, when I first had my heart broken. I could\
  \ no longer smile at her nor tell her that I loved seeing her. That was when I also\
  \ fell out love with traveling.\n\nBoracay island have become a tourist haven that\
  \ resulted to destruction brought about by development aggression and human-made\
  \ neglects. From a seafoam shoreline, hers became mossy due to the poor sanitation\
  \ in the island. Trees of old age were cut down in order to pave way for establishments\
  \ such as restaurants and hotels. Calm long-year summer nights were replaced by\
  \ lights and loud music by pubs along the coast. Its pristine underwater life turned\
  \ into a grey borderless aquarium. Human foot prints were everywhere in the form\
  \ of rubbish. Tourism has brought jobs for the locals but not for too long. The\
  \ ugly realities indeed outnumbered its beautiful physical attributes. Last year,\
  \ the government had shut down the island to give her time to recover. I fell out\
  \ of love with traveling. \n\nI fell out of love with \u201Cjust traveling\u201D\
  . Traveling had given my life meaning and for what I have seen with Boracay island,\
  \ I have sworn to become a conscious traveler. After years of ticking off my bucket\
  \ list, I have come to a point where I no longer find joy in only satisfying myself.\
  \ Through a different lens, I have become an eco-warrior in my own ways. I started\
  \ to care about the environment, the people in the communities I visit; their history\
  \ and their culture. I realized that I have responsibilities as a traveler, to protect\
  \ not only myself and my assets but others\u2019, including the rights of animals,\
  \ trees and other living things as well. After all, if we do not take care of our\
  \ planet, then what will be left for us and for the future generations to enjoy?\n\
  \nJust like in any relationship, traveling is two-way. While we gain a lot from\
  \ it, we must also give back through it. I began to think of ways, no matter how\
  \ small, I can make a positive impact. Perhaps bringing my travel cutleries wherever\
  \ I go seem small to some. But imagine if at least ten tourists do the same? That\
  \ would be approximately 90 pieces of disposable cutleries saved. There\u2019s a\
  \ big chance that you will be able to inspire others to travel consciously. \n\n\
  Being conscious whenever I travel has given me pure joy. I appreciated nature more,\
  \ the presence of other people, the wild life. And for some unexplainable reason,\
  \ my senses have become more sensitive in a positive way. All of sudden, every taste\
  \ is differently savory, every odor is distinctly unique\u2014 I became more appreciative!\
  \ \n\nFor traveling to be sustainable for everyone, everyone must travel sustainably."
