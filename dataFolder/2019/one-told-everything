Text: "I never thought this far and unknown place would be my best experience. I am\
  \ indeed looking for an island in my country that we as Indonesians have not recognized\
  \ as a beautiful island. Once found you, Sumba in 2015. When nihiwatu has not been\
  \ nominated as the best hotel in the world. I really feel very curious, why in the\
  \ world do foreigners invest their money on this island. There is not much information\
  \ about what's on this island, tourism and others. But I can find information about\
  \ the price of land there. I think that this island only another island with beautiful\
  \ Long Beach around it. So I just say to myself, well they do it because it's far\
  \ away and they can make it remote so what makes this hotel expensive is privacy.\
  \ Until I found Lake Weekuri on one of the websites that sell land in Sumba. I immediately\
  \ fell in love with it. The lake is very amazing. I can imagine myself swimming\
  \ there every time I watch it. I want to swim to the end of the corner. From that\
  \ moment, I decided, I have to go there as soon as possible. But none of my friends\
  \ wanted to come with me at that time. I almost wanted to go alone but my parents\
  \ did not allow me. So it never happened until 2017. At the 2017 new year party,\
  \ I encourage my new friends that I met at the voluntary event to go with me to\
  \ Sumba. I don't even know what to see on Sumba besides Lake Weekuri and Nihiwatu\
  \ Resort. But I persuaded them to believe that Sumba was worth seeing. And they\
  \ bought it, and 10 of us went to Sumba in August 2017. When I arrived, I did find\
  \ that every road we passed made me feel like I was in New Zealand. Maybe not 100%\
  \ the same, but that's how I feel. The road is well paved, which I don't think it\
  \ will be like that cause it is a remote island in Indonesia. Lake Weekuri is as\
  \ beautiful as the video I watched. And I like the beach called Mandorak. It's not\
  \ a long one, it's just small and slightly sunken with two sides of the Clift around\
  \ it. We went there for sunset, and it was amazing. The waves are very high, and\
  \ the existence of a cliff makes the sun is the centering it. And that was magical.\
  \ The waves crushing the cliffs, the sun sets in the middle of 2 cliffs. I don't\
  \ want to go back to my hotel, if I can, I will stay longer but we can't. We returned\
  \ to our hotel, the Sumba hospitality foundation. This is not only a hotel but is\
  \ a foundation for Sumba people to learn about hospitality.I found it on the Internet.\
  \ Luckily for us, this hotel is open at the beginning of 2017. The hotel has a bamboo\
  \ architecture, and has an outdoor shower. I had never slept in a bamboo house before,\
  \ so it was very excited. And we only need to leave the room to see the Milky Way.\
  \ Great night. I don't have to climb the mountain to see it. Than there\u2019s of\
  \ a place called a winding hill. I have never seen anything like this. But the hills\
  \ were so beautiful and pleasant to me. Many local children played there and my\
  \ mind kept thinking, how happy they were to have this beautiful place as their\
  \ playground. The best sunsets on Sumba are on the beach called walakiri. There\
  \ I learned that the sunset never ended until it was completely dark. Every minute,\
  \ I can't stop taking pictures  because the color of the sky keeps changing. Never\
  \ get bored for a second. It seemed like I finally saw that the sunset was something\
  \ that had to wait, because the process told a different story. Lastly, I did not\
  \ expect to find new travel mate on this journey and  decided to went to England\
  \ in 2018. I never know when I exactly I have a chance to went to Sumba but I keep\
  \ wishing on it until I can realize it."
