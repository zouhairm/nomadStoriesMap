Text: "TRAVEL SUCCESS.\n        Theme: A Leap into the unknown.\n         Having seen\
  \ beautiful pictures from my years of being a toodler to teen age, imagining I could\
  \ jump into the future of traveling everywhere i could without so much thoughts\
  \ in mind ,it was really amazing and an experience i was joyous about already till\
  \ i heard mother scream my name Lauren!!! Still smiling sheepishly of my thoughtful\
  \ experiences i was having in my pictures i heard my name again. I ran quickly having\
  \ that contagious smile, she asked why so happy, i was like I couldn't wait to grow\
  \ up already. She said, you don't need to grow older before achieving your dreams\
  \ ,you can pen them down and still build yourself in imaginations that can take\
  \ you places you wish for. She smiles then told me to help with the dinner, did\
  \ all went back with all the wise words still ringing in my head like you can do\
  \ do all while still young. \n           Going through my twitter account and replying\
  \ tweets from nosy friends, i came across a tweet from Bren which made me confident\
  \ about myself. I decided to give the essay a try , getting a response with \"Dear\
  \ Lauren, i am happy to inform you that i screamed at the top of my voice and said\
  \ i made it finally at a young age i got to have a leap to that unknown that seemed\
  \ so far, this actually began my teen travel success stories."
