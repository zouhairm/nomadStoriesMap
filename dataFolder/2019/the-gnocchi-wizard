Text: "It occurred time after time in my 27 years revolving around the sun and roaming\
  \ this floating space rock. I have a feeling it will continue perpetually for the\
  \ rest of my life.\n\nOne would think I had learnt to deal with these frequent situations.\
  \ Perhaps I\u2019m now adept to overcoming the array of negative emotions aroused\
  \ by such catastrophic interludes in my life. A punishing exaggeration really, surrounding\
  \ a notion most relish, that of returning to native soil. Maybe if I hadn\u2019\
  t played Huskys\u2019 \u201CI\u2019m not coming home\u201D on repeat for the final\
  \ hours of my long-haul flight my mind wouldn\u2019t have been so deceived!\n\n\
  I never intended to be like this, wild, free and impervious, nor did the people\
  \ surrounding me. The day it transpired I can only liken to Harry Potter getting\
  \ told he was a wizard. The predisposed way of life that bound me, faded rapidly\
  \ and I was thrown into a new world discovering my magic. The world was not my oyster\
  \ rather my Hogwarts! \n\nThe freshman year granted numerous encounters with the\
  \ dark side. Each adversity growing, changing and constantly renovating long-standing\
  \ constructs of self. One thing was certain though, my earliest voyages all conceded\
  \ in the same manner. Manifested as this habitual sequence; Travel with a one-way\
  \ ticket amid a diminutive money situation, run out of money, \u2018dirt bag\u2019\
  \ it with no money, find the cheapest flight home, influence Mum and Dad to pay\
  \ for said flight, find a job, save for a few months earning generous Australian\
  \ wages and then repeat what is a highly addictive cycle. \n\nOther portrayals of\
  \ returning home yield far more misadventure, but you see this was my first time,\
  \ and we all know the influence of inaugural dealings. Let me tell you, it wasn\u2019\
  t like eating an Italian Nona\u2019s gnocchi for the first-time kind of first times.\
  \ Mmm, I do remember my first true Italian \u2018Nona made\u201D gnocchi though!\
  \ It was whilst roaming through the true Italy. No tourists, nor anyone who looked\
  \ like they could speak English and with the scrutiny of a whole towns gaze, as\
  \ if we had landed from outer space and not by train.\n\n Due to my spontaneity,\
  \ lack of future planning and the fact it was 11pm on a Sunday night in a region\
  \ hailed the Bronx of Italy (a minor detail I withheld from my slightly anxious\
  \ travel mate), it seemed increasingly likely we would sleep under the stars. But\
  \ you see I had already completed a year in the school of wizardly. I knew that\
  \ when things didn\u2019t go to plan or in my case, when no plan existed, always\
  \ summoned the greatness encounters, at the very least it conjured a good story.\
  \ Call me reckless, but \u2018winging it\u2019 is the philosophy that constitutes\
  \ my way of living.\nThe moment my friend gave up on a bed that night synchronised\
  \ to my eyes locking with our saviour, Mumma Simona. She was a youthful captivating\
  \ and veracious Italian lady, decadent chocolate brown skin, perfectly rounded dark\
  \ red curls and a captivating purity about her. No real words transpired late that\
  \ evening, just a mutual understanding between two humans. Her kind eyes telepathic\
  \ to mine, ensuring a concrete slumber was averted. Not only averted but our night\
  \ was transformed. I was in awe of our new-found friends\u2019 kindness and hospitality,\
  \ the same I try to replicate and pay forward to the people I meet! One cannot forget\
  \ the gnocchi! Oh get me more of Simona\u2019s Nona\u2019s gnocchi! The night ended\
  \ with a full belly, a roof over our heads and an immense appreciation for life.\n\
  \nYears later a lovely lady described good gnocchi as \u201Cpillows of heaven hitting\
  \ the roof of one\u2019s mouth\u201D, as the words echoed, I was taken back to this\
  \ very moment in time, more notably to the catalyst of the story, the reason for\
  \ it being, and the positive impact it has bestowed. This my friends is why I became\
  \ a wizard!\nOn a side note, no one really wanted to hear the winging accounts of\
  \ assimilating back to the \u2018mortal\u2019 existence after each semester spent\
  \ at Hogwarts\u2026\u2026\u2026did they?\n\nUntil next time, Namaste.\n\nThe Zilky\
  \ Way xx"
