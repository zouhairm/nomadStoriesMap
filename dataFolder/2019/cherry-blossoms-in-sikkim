Text: "November in Sikkim is the month of Paiyum flowers or the Cherry Blossoms. In\
  \ Sikkim, it\u2019s a common sight to see the beautiful pink and white petals grace\
  \ the roadside. Every year, people wait in anticipation for the blossoming of the\
  \ trees that dot the urban and rural scenery. This is a welcome sight as it usually\
  \ brings the cold winter air and clear skies, a departure from the previous month\
  \ of wet and humid rains.\nAs pretty as they are, the Cherry flowers have a short\
  \ lifespan of up to a few weeks. By the fourth week of November the flower falls\
  \ off and new leaves emerge. In the Japanese culture, the unfortunately short lifespan\
  \ of the Cherry flowers is a representation of life itself, which is tremendously\
  \ beautiful but extremely fragile and transient. This concept of transience and\
  \ impermanence of all things in life can also be found in Buddhism. \nOver the years,\
  \ the Department of Forests in its programme the \u201CState Green Mission\u201D\
  \ has planted hundreds of Cherry seedlings all over the state, many of which have\
  \ started blossoming. If this continues, Sikkim can think of hosting its own \u201C\
  Cherry Blossom Festival\u201D in the state, like it\u2019s done in Japan.\nCurrently,\
  \ Temi Tea Estate located 51km from Gangtok against the backdrop of the mighty Kanchenjunga,\
  \ Hosts the Chery Tea Festival a 3-day long carnival to celebrate the beauty of\
  \ Chery Blossoms, Various adventure activities like photography competition and\
  \ cultural programmers are organized which attracts a lot of locals and tourists\
  \ and they for the same enjoy it thoroughly. \nAs the Cherry flowers die and new\
  \ leaves emerge, Sikkim moves into the cold winters with clear blur skies and a\
  \ wonderful sense of celebration all around, one can see people wearing colorful\
  \ jackets. December is, after all, the month of celebration- from Loosoong to Christmas\
  \ to Red Panda Festival and many more in being celebrated all around the state.\
  \ This is the essence of winter- festivity, positivity and a sense of belonging."
