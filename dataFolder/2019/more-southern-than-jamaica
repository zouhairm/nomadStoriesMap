Text: "In an alcohlic haze I bought tickets to St. Thomas one of the US territories.\
  \ I decided on St. Thomas because it was the furthest I could go with out having\
  \ to purchase a passport. I was a complete and absolute horrible waste of a human\
  \ being. My arrangements we're not very well made so when I arrived on St. Thomas\
  \ I was left to strangers taking me in. I actually had expected that. Funny I think\
  \ about that stuff today and it really is funny that I survived my idiocy...I'm\
  \ still surviving it. My stay with strangers were short lived and exciting. I had\
  \ a very few things I had brought with me and they got even fewer in a very short\
  \ amount of time. I stayed drunk...that was very easy to do there. I found myself\
  \ to be occupied with all aspects of the island life. Drinking Pi\xF1a Coladas getting\
  \ caught in the rain dancing until midnight more like until the morning and doing\
  \ it all over again. I had little jobs in bars but always got fired because I would\
  \ drink more than my paycheck. I really do not know how many people and families\
  \ let me into their homes. Probably well over fifty. I had friends on all the USVI's\
  \ that loved my company sober. When I started drinking, I had to go. The love from\
  \ those locals was  like feeling the love of God. Whenever I got caught in the rain\
  \ without an umbrella the local women would say \"You're being baptized sister!\
  \ Start fresh.\" No one ever said \"bye\" or \"see you later\", the level of love\
  \ in the Carribean is higher than anywhere else I have been in my travels, they\
  \ always said \"be safe\" as their salutation. I learned about and gained a certain\
  \ love for watching Cricket. They would never let me play though. I thought that\
  \ to be extremely sexist, and it is. St. Thomas and St. Croix have been completely\
  \ Americanized. The islands have been made into tourist Mecca's. St. John has remained\
  \ pristine and virgin to human development. St. Kitts home to Foxy's is a British\
  \ island not too far from St. John, is still so beautiful and pristine as well and\
  \ the British's best kept secret. St. John is closer to St. Kitts than St. Thomas,\
  \ so it was easy to get smuggled onto the British owned island occasionally, for\
  \ a night or two at a time.  My favorite part of being in the Carribean life is\
  \ CARNIVAL. The costumes, the music the dancing, the food mmmmmm, the  straight\
  \ up love from all the people. Carnival is by far my favorite place and time to\
  \ be living life best. If I ever go back to my favorite place on Earth it will be\
  \ by cruise ship, during carnival and I will stay for the whole thing in an air\
  \ b&b, this time completely sober and free to enjoy and experience the better parts\
  \ of St. Thomas and St. Croix and most of all hiking on St. John. I'll be enjoying\
  \ the islands and not putting myself in harm's way because I am not fully functioning\
  \ properly. St. Thomas was my University of Hard Knocks...mostly of my own making.\
  \ I learned a lot experienced more and came home stronger harder tougher like a\
  \ diamond in the rough.  Today I have more experience than the US Virgin Islands\
  \ in my backpack and I still got room for a world more. I have found in my travels\
  \ a common theme, love truly generates people and people that don't travel don't\
  \ get to see that. I think if more people put effort into traveling and connecting\
  \ on different levels, than getting an education in field they have no passion for,\
  \ they would not see the world as dark and dreary, but as full and enriching like\
  \ they could be to the rest of the world. I think a person finds out who they truly\
  \ are when they go to far unknown to them kind of places. I know I have gained a\
  \ different perspective on my life in my travels. God made this planet for me. \
  \ I want to see it."
