Text: "My brother died.\nThis is what I think to myself as I push my bright mint luggage\
  \ through the rain of 7th avenue. A as I rush through Times Square to meet my father\
  \ at Penn Station, I wonder how did I find myself leaving work and meeting my father\
  \ at Penn Station on our way to embark on our first international trip together?\
  \ \n\nI refer to this as the best and worst year of my life. I\u2019m going to South\
  \ Africa to speak at a conference, received a promotion, was in a good place financially\
  \ (I spend all of my money on Ubers and seamless, but NEW YORK!), and my brother\
  \ died. The last one I think more than I say. People have intense reactions and\
  \ I\u2019m not prepared to offer comfort to their condolences. My father\u2019s\
  \ coping mechanism is attempting to be more present so here we are, on our way to\
  \ South Africa.\n\nI have reservations. First, my father is cheap. Second, neither\
  \ of us want to take this flight. I'd prefer teleportation but Emirates will do.\
  \ We arrive in Johannesburg; I go to speak and meet my father later. He\u2019s ripe\
  \ with complaints about our Airbnb. I happily get him a hotel. \u201CThere\u2019\
  s nothing to do in Joburg,\u201D he calls me saying. Apparently, he forgot I created\
  \ a guide of activities for him while I work. I remind him. He has that attitude\
  \ that made me go from a Daddy\u2019s girl to a text dodger. I look over the balcony\
  \ of my temporary Sandton home, pass the schoolyard with the red brick and red clay,\
  \ beyond the cluster of apartments, and into the deep blue sky and inhale. \u201C\
  We will be in Cape Town in three days dad. Try to enjoy Joburg,\u201D I cheerily\
  \ end the call. Then I text my sister, \u201Cyour father is getting on my nerves.\u201D\
  \ \n\nMy father and I love culture and history so I plan our itinerary with that\
  \ in mind. We go to a bar in Sandton, bear witness to beautiful faces that you could\
  \ easily find on the streets of New York, or Washington, D.C. In Soweto, we visited\
  \ Vilikazi Street. Tan restaurants, small red matchbox homes, lively markets, and\
  \ proud museums competing for attention. Performers sat outside, their powerful\
  \ voices the only thing that seemed authentic. My father and I found our rhythm\
  \ here, just as the singer in front of us, singing Whitney, using her slender fingers\
  \ to keep the time like a metronome. One, tap, three, tap.  \u201CI will alwaaaaayssss,\
  \ loooooveeeee youuuu\u201D we finished together. I went back to my airbnb, at peace,\
  \ when I received a text from the funeral director. My brother\u2019s tombstone\
  \ arrived. I felt this was his way of saying, \u201CI\u2019m still with you.\u201D\
  . I called my dad at his hotel, thinking he would have the same happiness. There\
  \ was silence. \u201CDad?\u201D, I asked. The chirp of insects that sounded big\
  \ enough to be in Jurassic Park were a testament to how quiet South Africa was at\
  \ night. \u201CDad?,\u201D I repeated. A guttural wail of sadness and regret was\
  \ the response. \u201CHe\u2019s happy we are here, together. Get some rest. I\u2019\
  ll talk to you in the morning.\u201D I hung up, looked at my friends with what must\u2019\
  ve looked like pure despair, and they rushed to my side. \u201CWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201D\
  \ they asked. My brother died, was my response in a final, and mournful wail.\n\n\
  \"Welcome home\", was the greeting at the Cape Town airport. We explored beaches,\
  \ culinary tours, and then we attempted to climb Table Mountain. For hours we attempted\
  \ to keep our footing, daring the other to quit first. When we finally decided that\
  \ we couldn\u2019t go anymore, my father wrote our initials on a rock, \u201CSo\
  \ when I\u2019m gone and you come back with your family, you can see this and think\
  \ of our amazing time here.\u201D I looked out at the colorful rows of homes below\
  \ us disappearing into the ocean. When did my father get so spiritual, I wondered.\
  \ Oh, when my brother died. We lost a very special part of our family, but what\
  \ we are finding, one country at a time, is each other."
