Text: "My first trip\n\n             I still remember the first trip to the beach\
  \ that I took with my close friends. Two years ago, my friends and I went to Tamarindo\
  \ Beach to rest and enjoy our vacation together. We had been planning this trip\
  \ for two weeks. During these two weeks we made hotel reservations and bought food\
  \ and beverages for the trip. Finally, one Friday we left at 6 a.m. to Tamarindo\
  \ and arrived around 10 a.m.. As soon as we arrived to the hotel, we started to\
  \ drink at the bar in the swimming pool. A few hours later we were drunk, so we\
  \ decided to go to the beach. We played a funny soccer game to down the level of\
  \ alcohol in our blood. It was a funny experience because nobody was able to kick\
  \ the ball and almost everybody was sick. After the game, we watched the sunset\
  \ together, and we told stories about our lives and shared our points of view about\
  \ the future. Then we returned to the hotel, and we ate some snacks. Moreover, we\
  \ drink another beers and swam in the pool until it got late. Around 12 p.m. we\
  \ decided to play some games where the loser had to take some shots. A lot of times,\
  \ I was the loser and therefore I did not remember what else happened during that\
  \ crazy night. The next morning we took a bicycle ride to some close beaches. I\
  \ remember vividly the ride to Conchal Beach since it was so pretty. For that reason,\
  \ we decided to stayed there the rest of the day and enjoy the breathtaking views\
  \ of this paradise beach. After this exhausting trip to Conchal, we returned to\
  \ our hotel. The next day, very early, we returned to San Jos\xE9. That was my first\
  \ and unforgettable trip with my friends."
