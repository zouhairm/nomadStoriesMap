Text: "I happened to come to Milan for a week in the end of August, 2018. One morning\
  \ I came out from my hotel to see The Last Supper by Leonardo da Vinci in the Refectory\
  \ of the Convent of Santa Maria delle Grazie. I hope for a small chance that somebody\
  \ would have refused to go inside the chapel, though I hadn't reserved my visiting\
  \ of this place before. Unfortunately, I failed to obtain a spare ticket. Moreover,\
  \ the entrance to this legendary convent was closed for tourists at that time (it\
  \ would be opened only in the evening).\n\nBeing disappointed this fact, I remembered\
  \ that not so far from this place there was another famous church, which is known\
  \ as Chiesa di San Maurizio al Monastero Maggiore, which was worth for seeing, too.\
  \ After a minute I got on a tram, then I noticed from the tram\u2019s window the\
  \ building of the church, but the next tram stop was rather far than I expected.\
  \ Eventually, I could manage to reach this church. Fortunately, it was possible\
  \ to enter and the entrance turned out free of charge. \n\nWhen I came inside, I\
  \ stood without breathe, opened my mouth and I couldn\u2019t move, looking at beautiful\
  \ frescoes on the walls and listening to majestic eternal music. Seeing these frescos,\
  \ I remembered my atheistic childhood under the Iron Curtain without any possibility\
  \ to go abroad. One day when I learnt in the school, we had the first lecture about\
  \ Renaissance art, which became the last for us, because we were shown masterpieces\
  \ with naked bodies and it was predictable that some of my mates began to laugh.\
  \ (I should mention that magazines like Playboy were prohibited in Soviet Union).\
  \ Our lecturer guessed that this laugh was concerning her words and our parents\
  \ had to ask her pardon for us but in vain. At the same time, Bible was also prohibited\
  \ in Soviet Union, which made a serious obstacle for us for understanding plots\
  \ of the pictures. So, standing in the church, having little knowledge about frescos\
  \ on the walls, I felt that it was a good luck that I could even reach this place,\
  \ while some of my classmates had passed away already. I got the feeling that I\
  \ could come to Chiesa di San Maurizio al Monastero Maggiore instead of my died\
  \ friends and see these masterpieces instead of them."
