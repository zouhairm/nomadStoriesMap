Text: "Travelling between Marrakech and Ouarzazate, our driver Aziz stopped at a small\
  \ village to show us a well known mosque.  In the main square Aziz found a local\
  \ man willing to show us around.  After visiting the mosque Aziz gestured towards\
  \ the medina and offered for us to go get henna tattoos.  He knew I had wanted once\
  \ since I arrived and he had spoken to the local man about it.  I thought I had\
  \ missed my opportunity, having left the touristy souks in Marrakech behind us.\
  \  I was thrilled at the chance, my only hesitation was whether or not my friend\
  \ and her mother were up for the adventure.  It was now or never, and not wanting\
  \ to miss what could very well be my last chance, I chose now.  \nOff we went, following\
  \ the local man and Aziz down the narrow streets.  The medina was covered, which\
  \ made the streets dark and cool - a welcome contrast to the bright, hot, open spaces\
  \ of the village. Children were running in the streets and seemed curious about\
  \ us, though we were warned to keep our distance as we were prime targets to be\
  \ pick pocketed.\nAfter a short walk we arrived at a house.  Inside were three women,\
  \ who I presume to be a mother, a teenage daughter, and a small child, no more than\
  \ three years old.  The house was one large room with mats on the ground and an\
  \ archaic tv playing something in a fuzzy black and white, with a very small kitchen\
  \ off to the side.  While the mother prepared the pungent henna it quickly became\
  \ apparent that our language barrier would be a problem.  They spoke Arabic and\
  \ very little French and no English.  We spoke English and no Arabic. I was the\
  \ only one who knew very little French, trying to muster up useless phrases from\
  \ long forgotten high school classes.  Aziz was able to translate what I wanted\
  \ and then disappeared with the local man.\nWhile the mother was mixing the ingredients\
  \ for the henna we sat awkwardly in silence.  The teenage girl started applying\
  \ the henna and then I felt something in my lap.  I looked down and to my delight\
  \ the little girl was sitting right next to me and had put her hand in my lap. \
  \ I felt so special, like I had been chosen.  Here we were, and we couldn\u2019\
  t have been more different - in age, looks, background and religion - and we had\
  \ just become (in my eyes) best friends.   We never exchanged names, but suddenly\
  \ I heard some harsh sounding Arabic followed by \u201CMiriam.\u201D  Curious about\
  \ what was going on I turned to see the little girl with her finger in her nose.\
  \  We all giggled, because this is exactly what might happen across the Atlantic\
  \ in our own homes.  I did not feel out of place for a moment.  \nWhile the teenage\
  \ girl was applying the henna the mother was making mint tea.  I have to admit at\
  \ this point I became slightly jealous of my companions whose hands were not covered\
  \ in drying henna, because they were able to enjoy the tea.  Moroccan mint tea is\
  \ customarily served by your host or hostess, and a ceremony not to be missed. Everything\
  \ from the tea set to the presentation to the taste is wonderful.  Feeling comfortable\
  \ in my setting and not wanting to be left out I pursed my lips a couple of times\
  \ towards the mother, indicating my desire for tea.  She brought a tea cup to my\
  \ lips and let me take a couple of sips, just as my mother would have done.\nThis\
  \ experience was my favorite part about my trip to Morocco.  The henna was not expertly\
  \ done, but the time spent together was.  I could not have been happier with the\
  \ result.  At the end of our nine day adventure we were at the airport waiting to\
  \ board our plane home.  I was almost in tears telling my friend, \u201CYou can\
  \ go home, Giulia, but I don\u2019t think I should.\u201D  The hospitality in Morocco\
  \ rivals no other place, especially at Manzil al Miriam, or Miriam\u2019s House."
