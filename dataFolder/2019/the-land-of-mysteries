Text: "We are 7 billion person on the world. Different sexe, color, religion, language\
  \ and behavior. From every experience we get a new human being who is so unique.\
  \ From our experience we get principles and ideas. The majority of time, we get\
  \ them from our parents and people in our society, from our religion and beliefs.\
  \ Acceptance is always hard for each person, we need a high level of thinking and\
  \ maturity to accept the variety of persons in the world.\nI have been raised as\
  \ Muslim, with a lot of prohibitions and rules that control us. I get the chance\
  \ to travel last year to Tunis, which is the neighbor of my country Algeria. Same\
  \ people, language and even religion. In my experience as exchange participant with\
  \ Aiesec, I met different people from all over the world: Black and White, Male\
  \ and female. Muslim, atheist, Christian and jewish. Wow, We shared commun language:\
  \ English, commun two different sexe: no more, color of skin and sexuality preference\
  \ doesn't matter. we were and still: friends. we shared a lot of great moment and\
  \ I loved them. That love control me to try and save them from Hell because they\
  \ were non Muslim so they will burn there. They were in a wrong religion and belief\
  \ and they need to be conducted to the right path.\nI started to debate in religions\
  \ subjects: god, prohibitions,...  At every debate, I finished by believing that\
  \ I don't nothing about the real things, nor do they. Every person have his own\
  \ belief and ideas, his own experience conduct him to be more faithful in his ideas\
  \ and more aware with the falseness of others. How could this happens? I thought\
  \ that as a Muslim I can convince each one of them, but I couldn't, even sometimes\
  \ They convinced me by their theories. \nWhere is the wrong of that? no, the real\
  \ question: what it means wrong and how can we measure it?, who is at the right\
  \ path and who's not?, All the W H questions came to my mind each time to solve\
  \ this mysteries.\nThe one and the only response is: We are all right or on another\
  \ word: we are all wrong, No matter your belief or religion or any other thing:\
  \ it doesn't matter. We share humanity and we don't have to judge each other. \n\
  I remember a quote that said \" All the men are the same\". It is 100% true, transform\
  \ it in my experience and belief\" All the humans are the same\", Despite our difference,\
  \ we still had the same talk i used to have with my society's friends, we talked\
  \ the same subjects, shared the same jokes and played the same games. Sometimes\
  \ when I want to remember it I say: \" It is like here but we use English to talk\"\
  .\nThis mystery have been solved at first but the real question is: How many mysteries\
  \ still the travel hide for us?"
