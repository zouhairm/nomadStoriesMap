Text: "I have complicated dietary requirements...absolutely no gluten, no meat or\
  \ alcohol, limited dairy. These are medical limitations that have been with me for\
  \ decades, and they just form part of the backdrop of my life. I have to be strict,\
  \ because otherwise I get very sick. When I travel I'm used to a steady travel diet\
  \ of omelettes, steamed rice, and fresh fruit and vegetables. I get specific phrases\
  \ translated so I can order in restaurants, and I shop in markets for staples. I\
  \ supplement this with tasteless protein bars from home. While it's not a lot of\
  \ variety or fun, it means I get to travel. Some areas are easier than other, but\
  \ I've just never traveled for cuisine. \n\nUntil I got to Argentina that is. It's\
  \ generally known as a country famous for red meat and wine, but it should really\
  \ be known as gluten-free paradise. (As well the more standard points of interest\
  \ to tourists including tango and soccer, Evita, the Andes and glaciers, obviously).\
  \ \n\nI went to Argentina, because I wanted to go to Easter Island and see the giant\
  \ head statues and to get there from New Zealand I had to transit through Santiago\
  \ and if I go that far I might as well keep going (and that kind of spiral is responsible\
  \ for the best and the worst of my life choices). I only decided to go on a trip\
  \ six weeks before I got on a plane, and I was too busy to really plan anything.\
  \ I decided just to book some accommodation in Buenos Aires and see what happened.\
  \ \n\nAnd what happened was the best food and the best variety of food in my life,\
  \ including the first piece of lemon meringue pie (my favourite) I've been able\
  \ to eat in 20 years. I might actually move there (and anyone who suggests I should\
  \ learn to bake might like to know I currently have seven different beverages in\
  \ my fridge, and literally no food. Me learning to bake is a less of a practical\
  \ solution than me moving to Argentina). Thanks to a law passed in 2012, Argentina\
  \ has excellent labeling and availability of gluten free food. Buenos Aires has\
  \ a number of completely gluten free restaurants and bakeries. Almost every normal\
  \ restaurant and market has variety of safe, tasty, and interesting options. \n\n\
  My favourite day was a simple one. I walked from my hotel through the fairly residential\
  \ neighbourhood of Retiro. It was at least 30 degrees and quite humid, so I stopped\
  \ for a break at the completely gluten-free Gout bakery, where I had the delicious\
  \ lemon meringue pie, and continued on into Recoleta. I found the small but famous\
  \ cemetery that houses many notable Argentinians, including Eva Duarte (better known\
  \ as Eva Peron, or Evita).  A section was cordoned off because there was an anarchist\
  \ bombing several months ago (the only person hurt was the bomb maker) but most\
  \ areas were open. It reminded me of Pere Lachaise in Paris, with soaring stone\
  \ angels sitting as monuments on the tombs of the city's most famous families. Some\
  \ graves are well tended, clean, and adorned by flowers. Some are crumbling and\
  \ broken, with glass panes shattered and allowing the elements in. It is a place\
  \ of peace, even though there are many high rises that overlook the area, and remind\
  \ you of the city outside the brick wall. I then walked several streets over, to\
  \ a cafe that is completely gluten free. I had delicious bread rolls and omelette.\
  \ I strolled through the leafy streets, some residential and fancy, others lined\
  \ with shops, back to my hotel. I had a nap, before heading out to a nearby restaurant\
  \ for dinner. \n\nIt was a simple day, and maybe it sounds unremarkable to you,\
  \ but the freedom and choice of eating anything on a restaurant menu is something\
  \ I've never really had. Even having a choice of restaurants was a pleasant surprise.\
  \ It made me realise how much time I spend trying to find suitable food, especially\
  \ when I'm travelling. \n\nI didn't expect to find a country that gave me more freedom\
  \ than home, but that's what I found in Buenos Aires."
