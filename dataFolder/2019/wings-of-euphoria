Text: It wasn't wanderlust that brought me to this spellbinding and bewitching town
  but it left me speechless for sure.When I first step foot in this beautiful land
  of rich cultural heritage and green nature I was stunned and I couldn't get enough
  of it. I was in a town in a country that is not known to many when it comes to tourist
  destinations around Europe. However, it's one of the destinations that is closest
  to my heart. I had a chance to visit this country because of a debate competition
  which lasted for a week. Since, it was an international competition there were many
  people who were a part of it. I still remember, one fine day a treasure hunt was
  organized and all of us participated in it. We were running and looking around for
  clues all over the town. I did not win the competition but I sure made a connection
  to the place and I would forever cherish the memories. I was simply transfixed by
  the beauty of the place. It was just so different from what I expected. In fact,
  I didn't know what to expect because I had never heard of the place. I was surely
  excited but I sure didn't know that it would be one of my very best experiences.I
  simply couldn't help but fall in love with simplicity and calmness of the town.
  Being a city girl it was all very new to me. It was just so green, so beautiful
  and so enchanting. Even though when I was there, I just went around town, it was
  all still a wonderful experience for me not only because of the sight but also because
  of finding something extraordinary much into the world of chaos and unknown.
