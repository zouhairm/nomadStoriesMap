Text: "How to travel the world like a broke girl abroad in her 20\u2019s living without\
  \ a credit card.\n\nForget Clothes. Buy flights. Open up your mind.\nDownload HotelTonight\
  \ app\nSubscribe to Ryanair & Vueling email list\nBe ready to book a random flight\
  \ on a Friday afternoon for the following weekend without thinking twice.\n\n\n\
  #1 Flight Hacks\nThe 6:55am flight. Something my poor little brain has become accustomed\
  \ to these past few years abroad. While my friends scan clothes and gadgets during\
  \ the black friday sale, I refreshed Ryanair and Vueling like my life depended on\
  \ it. If you want to go to a town outside of a big city, I guarantee it is far cheaper\
  \ than flying into the aforementioned big city and getting a train.\n\nEG: Flight\
  \ to Rome; 12.99\u20AC + Train to Florence 9.99\u20AC Compared to Direct flight\
  \ to florence 89.99\u20AC\n\nI check in + lay out my clothes for the following morning\
  \ so Zombie \u20185am me\u2019 can glide through the notions without having to think\
  \ and can go straight back to sleep on the plane. \u2018Oh, but I can\u2019t fly\
  \ budget airlines.\u2019 you say?\n\nI fell asleep as we took off (on time) and\
  \ woke up as we landed (10 minutes ahead of schedule).\n\nUnicorn face mask: High\
  \ necessity.\n\n\n#2 Never catch taxis. Ever.\nWalk! I typed in \u20181 day in Rome\u2019\
  \ into \u2018google itinerary\u2019 and was granted with a mapped out walking tour\
  \ of fucking bliss around Rome free of charge. Instead of paying the 20\u20AC fee\
  \ to the train station later that day I grabbed a 2\u20AC mini bottle of wine (complimentary\
  \ plastic cup from charming Italian) and walked there passing the charming streets\
  \ of Rome. Getting immersed in all the sights and profound characters I meet along\
  \ the way.  A traveling hustler takes a polaroid of me in front of the Colosseum,\
  \ I hand him some cash and we exchange a huge hug. I know the hustle.\n\n\n \n\n\
  #3 Accommodation\nMy friends sometimes coil away in horror at how unorganized I\
  \ am. I scanned HotelTonight days before I left but knew I would get the best deal\
  \ on the \u2018morning of\u2019. As I waited for the train to Rome Central, I snagged\
  \ a beautiful hotel room on HotelTonight down to 50\u20AC from 120\u20AC with views\
  \ I still get goosebumps over.\n\n\n#4 Eats\nLiving in the international hub of\
  \ Barcelona I am so lucky to be blessed with friends from all over the world. There\
  \ is not one city I have been to recently where someone local hasn\u2019t flooded\
  \ me with all their secrets and recommendations. In Rome I lapped up the city\u2019\
  s best kept secret pasta place without having to wait for a table. A cool 24\u20AC\
  \ for a big ass pasta and bottle of wine for lunch that kept me full well into the\
  \ next afternoon. In Florence, I had more than enough recommendations to wander\
  \ the streets eating within my budget for 2 days. I was so under my budget by the\
  \ end of my trip I shouted myself a 20\u20AC bottle of wine just to write this blog\
  \ as I wait for the rain to pass.\n\n\n#5 Detach\nTrips like these make me realize\
  \ how available I am 24/7. I turned my phone off while I slept a solid 12 hours\
  \ and refused to turn it back on until an hour after I woke up.\n\n\nI realized\
  \ a lot of the communication in my life is just noise. It serves no purpose in my\
  \ goals and goes against every value and belief I have in myself. Being in a different\
  \ country on your own allows you to see what is working and what is not. It allows\
  \ you to pull it all apart and re-evaluate, coming home with new boundaries and\
  \ goals set in place.\n\nWithout solo travel I imagine myself to be in a lunatic\
  \ asylum. But here I am\n\nDrinking an entire bottle of wine outside Duomo. My new\
  \ goals ready to be plastered all over my walls upon my return. I came here 48 hours\
  \ ago an anxious mess. I can now go home to my fairytale with my sleeves pushed\
  \ up ready for what comes next!"
