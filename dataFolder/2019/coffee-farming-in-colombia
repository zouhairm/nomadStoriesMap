Text: "I gripped on to the sticky leather seat below me with white knuckles as I bounced\
  \ in every direction along the choppy mountain road. Meanwhile, our driver Memo\
  \ grinned from ear to ear and shouted over the grumbling engine of his original\
  \ Blue Willy Jeep Wrangler. Despite every dial in the car being broken and there\
  \ being no seat belts, this 4-wheel drive Jeep drove like a champ up the unpaved\
  \ roads. Exactly where we were heading was lost in translation. \nNo matter how\
  \ great I felt my Spanish skills had become, I could barely decipher the slang and\
  \ local accent that Memo was speaking. All my husband and I were sure of was that\
  \ we were headed to Memo's coffee farm in the hills of Mistrato, a small town in\
  \ Colombia's coffee country. \n\nMemo's single-level white brick farmhouse sat modestly\
  \ atop the rolling green hills. The slopes of the hills intersected each other on\
  \ either side like an opening zipper revealing the valley below. Each morning we\
  \ crawled out of our stone guest house with no electricity to find the fingers of\
  \ the white clouds slowly receding over each tooth of the hill's zipper. The aroma\
  \ of fried sweet corn arepas wafted through the air pulling us towards the kitchen.\
  \ Memo's wife, Martha stood over the stove whipping up fluffy yellow eggs from the\
  \ chickens. Ethan and I salivated over the day's grub. Every meal filled us to the\
  \ brim with pork fat and delicious farm-to-table food. \n\nWe joined Memo on the\
  \ front lawn to attempt milking his cows for the umpteenth time. He cheered me on,\
  \ believing a city girl from the U.S. could manage at least a squirt from the cow's\
  \ teet this morning. I did him one better and filled the bucket halfway with foaming\
  \ white milk. \n\n\"This cow is way easier than your other one,\" I tell Memo. \n\
  \nHe laughs and says, \"Melissa, estas muy guapa!\" My husband rolls his eyes, as\
  \ I swoon over our charismatic and handsomely rugged host.\nWe asked Memo what our\
  \ job would be for the day, and he waved us off in a nonchalant way and said, \"\
  nada, descansa mi amigos, disfruta la vista!\" My husband grunted in frustration.\
  \ Every day we asked what we could do to help and every day Memo brushed us off\
  \ and told us just to relax and enjoy the view. We signed up to volunteer our time\
  \ helping on the coffee farm in exchange for free room and board, but all he had\
  \ let us do so far was milk the cows and stuff our faces full of Martha's delicious\
  \ cooking. We felt spoiled and lazy. We couldn\u2019t tell if this was just the\
  \ culture or he didn\u2019t believe we had the capacity to work hard since we are\
  \ American.\n\nAfter packing on a heavy load of fatty meats and fresh squeezed lulo\
  \ juice for lunch, we insisted on helping pick coffee. All along the steep muddy\
  \ hills of Memo's property grew organic coffee plants. The kind of stuff that you\
  \ pay $4 for a small cup of at Starbucks in the States. Memo agreed to let us work\
  \ and handed us rubber boots, a basket with a woven belt to strap around our waists\
  \ and told us to follow him down the hill. I waddled down after the men in my enormous\
  \ boots and we stopped at a row of waist-height coffee plants with their shiny green\
  \ leaves and red berries. Memo told us to only pick the really red berries and put\
  \ them in our basket. We stood in the mud and misty rain wetting our faces, whilst\
  \ straddling steep terraces of trees. Our hands turned brown with mud and our cheeks\
  \ warmed red with slaps from the sun. We took pictures for Instagram and laughed\
  \ as we slid on our butts down the hill by accident. At the end of the day we carried\
  \ our haul up the hill and weighed it. Between the two of us we only picked 16 kilos\
  \ and the men working all day long picked 120 kilos. We felt foolish and deeply\
  \ respected the hard work of these coffee farmers."
