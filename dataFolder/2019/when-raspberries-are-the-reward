Text: "By the light of our car headlights we are setting up our tents on a damp and\
  \ cold stretch of grass behind the closed train station of the Tshiuetin Rail in\
  \ Sept-\xCEles, Quebec. It is late August, 3am,  and we have driven 1,234km from\
  \ Ontario to get here. Our group of six is made up of one wilderness canoe guide\
  \ fresh off the trail, four former wilderness canoe guides, and and one childhood\
  \ friend who is generally athletic but has never gone canoeing, and as we learned\
  \ later, isn\u2019t very comfortable swimming. Tomorrow morning we will board the\
  \ train and instead of getting off at one of the regular stops that connects remote\
  \ communities in northern Quebec and Labrador, we will request to be dropped at\
  \ the side of the tracks, at mile-marker 206. This is the start of our canoe trip\
  \ on the Moisie River. \n\nI am a Torontonian, raised in urban immediacy and I adore\
  \ it. But as a spaghetti-limbed 11 year old, I spent ten days on a canoe trip that\
  \ cemented my devotion to paddling and the wilderness. As one of the former guides\
  \ in our group, I was elated and relieved to go on an adventure again. I looked\
  \ forward to the deep comfort and enjoyment that comes from working hard with good\
  \ friends in a beautiful and wild setting and sitting by the fire at the end of\
  \ the day well-worked, well-fed, well-loved. \n\nI had come to expect this feeling\
  \ as a guarantee, a natural byproduct of the canoe trip, but when I looked up at\
  \ the slow goodbye of the train, doubt began gathering volume. We were undeniably\
  \ alone in a very unfamiliar landscape and despite our skill and experience, the\
  \ things we had not thought of or planned became evident. Like the unmarked portage\
  \ we needed to find that would take us from the 517 km\xB2 Lac Ashuanipi to the\
  \ Moisie River. Or the record high water levels that had been flooding rivers all\
  \ summer. \n\nThat first day on the water was cut short when we came under the hostile\
  \ wing of a thunderstorm with lightning directly over us. We rushed off the water\
  \ to the nearest island and spread out, assuming the balled up squat of a wilderness\
  \ lightening protocol. Soaked in our optimistic shorts and T-shirts, each of us\
  \ prayed to the gods we did or did not habitually believe in as crash to flash piggybacked\
  \ on each other with no respite. When the storm abated and we unfurled shaking off\
  \ the fear and reuniting together, our eye contact was more direct and our hugs\
  \ contained the gratitude of solidarity. We would need each other out here. \n\n\
  Our days continued like this, unforeseen and utterly relentless challenges of navigating\
  \ flooded class III whitewater, portaging in the steep inclines, waiting until the\
  \ ice in our water bottles thawed (yes, it was August), and moving through the early\
  \ morning fog like troops in the trenches. For the non-canoeist with us, we underestimated\
  \ the years of training  that helped us feel confident and calm in the face of discomfort,\
  \ challenge and risk. When he flipped in a set and was tumbled sputtering down a\
  \ row of waves, he admitted how terrified he was staring at the hydraulics, how\
  \ he was sure he\u2019d drown without his lifejacket.\n\nSuccess and safety was\
  \ not guaranteed on this river. That feeling, as we set into week two of the trip,\
  \ awakened a new level of hard-won reverence for each other, for our own bodies,\
  \ and for the ability to travel land like this. As wifi and cell service leaks farther\
  \ into once-remote spaces, our desire for unplugging pushes us further into the\
  \ bush. It\u2019s worth it. One day we picked an entire large pot of wild raspberries\
  \ that were abundant in the areas recently burned out by forest fire. We caught\
  \ rainbow trout and ate it that night. We connected our three canoes and used our\
  \ tarp as a sail, drifting without effort down 30km of the river while we discussed\
  \ absurd topics that only become worthy of discussion when you can\u2019t google\
  \ an answer and forget what your face looks like in a mirror."
