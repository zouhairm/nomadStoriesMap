Text: The grass is green everywhere but only my home land can fill my heart. To be
  honest it took three weeks in Malaysia and Thailand for me to grasp the saying 'there's
  no place like home', thank you Dorthy for those wise words of wisdom. As much as
  the travel over seas was memorial and the experience worth every bit of it, traveling
  my homelands has been by far, the best feeling my heart has endured. We only have
  one life and so many of us are so quick to jump on a plane without even a thought
  of what is in our own back yard and I can tell you now there are some amazing wonders
  to be found, seen and explored on the many straight and windy roads throughout Australia.
  I never expected to fall in love so much with my home, I've always had the thirst
  to explore, Japane, Italy, New York all the favorites you grow up watching on TV.
  But when I was in my late teens and sent on a bus, the sites I saw, the stop overs
  we made and the random inspiring people you meet, my heart hitch a knot I didn't
  understand until later. The traveling bug hit me hard and I still want to see the
  world, but my own back yard will forever hold my heart.
