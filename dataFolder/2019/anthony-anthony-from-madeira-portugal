Text: "Anthony Anthony also known as Anthony Vieira. My husband and I call him Grandpa\
  \ Tony.\nGrandpa Tony\u2019s parents were born in Portugal. Their names were Anthony\
  \ and Natalie Anthony, last name Anthony. It\u2019s a bit confusing I know. They\
  \ lived in the Madeira, Portugal area. Portuguese was their native language. My\
  \ great-grandmother and great-grandfather (Anthony Anthony II) immigrated to the\
  \ United States approximately one century ago. Ten years after they moved to America\
  \ they had  settled in Rochester, New York and  gave birth to their son Anthony\
  \ Vieira III on the 28th of September in 1927 at their home. Fun fact: this is one\
  \ thing my third son and HIS great-grandfather have in common; they were both born\
  \ at home instead of a hospital. Anthony the 3rd is now 91 years young. He is my\
  \ husband\u2019s mother\u2019s father. \nI married a into a Portuguese family. I\
  \ have three Portuguese sons (roughly 25%).\nPortuguese is the second most spoken\
  \ Romance language in the world, after Spanish. Portuguese is the sixth most spoken\
  \ native language throughout the entire world as well. The Portuguese language is\
  \ the official language of ten countries including Portugal. The other nine countries\
  \ are; Brazil, Mozambique, Angola, Guinea-Bissau, East Timor, Equatorial Guinea,\
  \ Macau, Cape Verde, and S\xE3o Tom\xE9 and Pr\xEDncipe.\nThe English language has\
  \ been greatly influenced by Portuguese. English has borrowed quite a few words\
  \ from Portugundergraduate uese such as banana and breeze. I personally have an\
  \ acute interest in the study of language. I have an degree in English Literature\
  \ and I am currently working as an English teacher in Rochester, New York. As a\
  \ working ESL (English to speakers of other languages) teacher I am committed to\
  \ my continual growth in field of Linguistics for the benefit of my current and\
  \ future students as well as myself. Traveling to Portugal, studying the richness\
  \ of the country\u2019s history, immersing myself in the culture and language of\
  \ the country will greatly inform the way I view and interact with my grandfather,\
  \ husband and three sons in relation to their Portuguese heritage. Studying and\
  \ exploring in Portugal will also greatly inform my pedagogy and interactions with\
  \ English my English Language learners.\nIn past years I have traveled to Canada,\
  \ Haiti, (before the Earthquake of 2010),Guatemala on a Mother and daughter service\
  \ trip, Mexico, Dominican Republic, Ecuador (to teach English to students in a remote\
  \ community located in the Andes Mountain range), as well as Ireland. As I travel\
  \ further from home with increased speed and frequency I am encouraged. Everyone\
  \ has a story. When one travels and engages in conversation with people walls of\
  \ preconceived notions are broken down, prejudices are dissolved and relationships\
  \ are formed.\n It would be a privilege and honor to travel to Portugal this year,\
  \ from Lisbon to Madeira there is much old family history to explore as well as\
  \ many new friends (and family) to meet."
