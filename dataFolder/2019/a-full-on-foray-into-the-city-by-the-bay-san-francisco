Text: "Nine months ago, I packed up my possessions and moved across the country, from\
  \ snowy Chicago to sunny San Francisco, alone.  Many people said that I was either\
  \ \u201Cvery brave,\u201D or \u201Cvery crazy,\u201D but I was on a mission, to\
  \ prove that it could be done- that picking up and starting a new life and surviving\
  \ in one of the world\u2019s most expensive cities was possible, and I\u2019ve succeeded\
  \ to that end. I\u2019d traveled to SF many times over the years, and had promised\
  \ myself that one day I\u2019d move there, to see more of the Bay Area, up close.\
  \ I\u2019d made a big move to England before, and lived there for nearly a decade,\
  \ so why not take the leap and move to San Francisco? I\u2019ve learned so much\
  \ over the past nine months about how different the culture is on the West Coast,\
  \ and that the struggle is real. I\u2019ve learned that many people here must work\
  \ at least two jobs just to survive; that the pay scale often doesn\u2019t match\
  \ up to the cost of living. I\u2019ve learned from firsthand experience that you\
  \ must make a lot of sacrifices to live here, often eschewing privacy and even comfort\
  \ in order to rent rooms in other people\u2019s houses, or share rooms and bathrooms\
  \ with strangers just to get by. I\u2019m now an expert in fine art of apartment-hunting\
  \ in SF, which is a unique animal, including understanding the difference between\
  \ a legitimate studio apartment, and the front room of a shared wing of a house\
  \ (it\u2019s known as an \u2018efficiency studio\u2019). I know now that there\u2019\
  s a long waiting list just to get onto the waitlist for rent-controlled housing.\
  \ That viewing an apartment in SF is more like a group audition or a club opening\
  \ than a property viewing, complete with a line around the block, and a bouncer,\
  \ in the form of an often clueless real estate manager, who\u2019s just showed up\
  \ thirty minutes late with the wrong keys, and once you do finally see the apartment\
  \ things like toilets, fridges and windows not facing brick walls are considered\
  \ \u201Cextras.\u201D I\u2019ve learned that all of the amusing stories you see\
  \ in movies about life in cities like New York are actually a reality in San Francisco,\
  \ complete with a nonstop cast of comical, random characters, who spice up the urban\
  \ experience like no other place I\u2019ve ever seen...and I\u2019ve been to New\
  \ York, London, Paris, and many other cities around the world! San Francisco is\
  \ the biggest, most in-your-face dichotomy between rich and poor, where tourists\
  \ and wealthy techies can view the Golden Gate Bridge from a distance whilst stepping\
  \ over homeless people and streets lined not with gold, but rather, dog poo. Where\
  \ drug pushers and their customers are shooting up heroine in alleys while hipsters\
  \ line up around the corner for the latest, trendiest version of the turmeric latte,\
  \ at the \u201Cnext big thing,\u201D pop up coffee shop, featuring sustainable,\
  \ home-brewed java, and artisan scones. Where Joe the plumber struts her stuff on\
  \ the cement catwalk, transformed as Josefine, decked out on the Muni, heading to\
  \ the Embarcadero, sitting next to the son of a billionaire property mogul, in an\
  \ Armani suit. And they\u2019re both wearing purple sunglasses. San Francisco is\
  \ a city of contradictions, in every sense, and it takes an ironclad fortitude to\
  \ survive this ridiculously transient metropolis. It is both everything I wanted\
  \ it to be, and nothing I expected it to be, it is like no other city on earth."
