Text: "Buffeted snow surrounded us as we trudged through the Trollheimen National\
  \ Park. Just as in the last week, we didn\u2019t meet a soul- Norway\u2019s national\
  \ parks had served up a treat we had not been able to fathom. Glassy frozen lakes,\
  \ towering mountains of snowy rock, just a dusting at the bottom, a full covering\
  \ as we took in some height. \n\nWe had squashed our 4 bags and ourselves into a\
  \ minute cab, the driver ever-assuring us that we would fit. We had lit fires after\
  \ emerging from tormenting storms, driving our tired limbs on at the threat of being\
  \ stuck on a mountain ridge during a downpour. The Norway flag we had bought in\
  \ Oslo had broken in two, we persevered, sticking it on top of a water bottle to\
  \ mark our camping spots. The quiet of the rolling hills, the steep peaks and the\
  \ clouded valleys drove us further.\n\nThe Rondane national park, to the north of\
  \ Oslo was a distant memory of snowy bliss, of untouched snow masking the paths\
  \ we negotiated nonetheless. In the Trollheimen park, our present location, there\
  \ was less snow. Less snow, but marshy wherever we trod. Finding a place to camp\
  \ would be impossible here. We didn\u2019t need to say it, we were all thinking\
  \ it.\n\nThe terrain continued. Surrounded by craggy mountains and alongside a huge\
  \ lake, it was getting late. Not dark, that didn\u2019t happen here. Not in the\
  \ summer, the sun hung in the sky for nearly the entire night- illuminating our\
  \ route. You had a strange feeling of energy when the sun was still up at midnight-until\
  \ you hit the sack. After that the waves of exhaustion hit instantaneously.\n\n\
  Down a ridge, backpacks on our back we passed a farmer, closing off his animals\
  \ for the night ahead. This was our man. \u201CWe are looking for a space to camp,\
  \ do you know of anywhere?\u201D\n\nHe beckoned, faultless English. Follow me. \n\
  \nInto the centre of the farm he led us, stopping in a field just by the lake. We\
  \ trudged in his wake, confused. He gestured here, the centre of his land. \n\n\u201C\
  Camp here, no cost.\u201D \n\nThe generosity we encountered in Norway was spellbinding.\
  \ Here we were, five of us, unshowered, unkempt, backpacks. I guess smiley. But\
  \ here we were, people shoved us into cabs when it was probably not meant to be.\
  \ Tea refills were the norm.\n\nWe set up our three tents, in a huddle against the\
  \ wind. Just marveling at the generosity, we lay there, tents up, books out. \n\n\
  Eystein (that was his name) came back to us- \u201CIt\u2019s Summer Solstice\u201D\
  . We had missed this, when you hike, you lose all sense of knowledge about the world\
  \ goings on. He gestures, a huge pile of wood. \u201CWe will have a bonfire, come\
  \ and join.\u201D\n\nThe generosity continued, a whole number of people had come\
  \ down from the village ahead for the bonfire. Sausages were passed out, warm food\
  \ different to the beans and couscous we had spent the last week and a half devouring.\
  \ We were accepted into the circle, made to feel at home in a place which didn\u2019\
  t need to do that. The fire roared and chatter hummed, the five of us sitting there,\
  \ still in awe.\n\nHow does it feel when the sun doesn\u2019t go down? You feel\
  \ invincible, the flames flickering in the background as people started to head\
  \ off, back through the woods and up the hill to the nearby village. We sit, immersed\
  \ in the events of the last hours. \n\nYou know when its one of those days? Out\
  \ of the woods come a man and a woman, the man clutching a saxophone. Up they come\
  \ and greet us, they are from the village too. And would they mind if they play\
  \ some music? The saxophone murmurs into life and the woman begins to sing, before\
  \ interrupting herself. She has wine too, would we like some? We vanish and return\
  \ with cups, the wine is shared, laughter, chat. \n\nIt is not that we expected\
  \ people to be standoffish. But we were five young men, unshaven, dirty, bedraggled.\
  \ All we were offered, for the entire trip, was kindness and warmth."
