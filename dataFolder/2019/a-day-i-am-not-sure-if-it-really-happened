Text: "Red leaves Kyoto: Autumn, 1997. I was walking through downtown into a very\
  \ tight winding neighborhood of Kyoto. Actually I had just lost myself as it commonly\
  \ happened hundreds of times while I was living there for six months. It was a way\
  \ for me to try to understand how things were there. Sometimes to find ourselves,\
  \ I think we definitely need to loose our strict line of thinking and let loose.\
  \ \n\nI was walking through those streets for some while already... The place at\
  \ dusk was very interesting, I couldn't tell what I could see in the next fifty\
  \ meters. \n\nSuddenly, I heard something so odd, so particularly enchanting I felt\
  \ almost like those snakes coming out from a basket of snake charmers. And I decided\
  \ to follow that sound at first very soft and as the streets were completely desert\
  \ I couldn't even ask anyone where that sound was coming from. \nThe sound took\
  \ me to an entrance that I hesitated to go beyond that step for a moment. It had\
  \ a pathway made of round rocks and a garden, a very detailed one, and it had a\
  \ curvy steep hill to step in.  And once again it was impossible to see what I would\
  \ find there. But the place didn't have any gate, and the whole thing was so unimaginable\
  \ for me what I would find I could't help not to get in. I took every single step\
  \ very carefully...\nI was so nervous and excited to discover what was that marvelous\
  \ sound, I didn't noticed how fast that track changed: at my front there was this\
  \ girl with a Koto instrument, an ancient Japanese harp, dressed as a geisha playing\
  \ a very traditional music, in one of the most beautiful garden I ever saw in life.\
  \ The whole scene made me freeze, it took me a while to move from there as I felt\
  \ I was time travelled back to the seventeen century. The music was something so\
  \ smooth and soft I was really breathless and the koto player had such a subtle\
  \ delicate face and fingers. Nothing there I could tell I was in reality and that\
  \ what I was seeing was real. I had been completely moved from myself even.\nI don't\
  \ know how much time I took there before I realize I was probably transpassing a\
  \ private property, probably of the Yakuza, the Japanese Mafia. But it seemed no\
  \ one noticed my presence there, not even the geisha player, as she continued as\
  \ I was never there. Although she was playing completely alone or I couldn't see\
  \ anyone else.\nI turn my back from where I came from and disappeared.\nUntil today\
  \ I find difficult to describe that place and moment as something that I lived as\
  \ a completely real moment. If someone invented a time travel that was the closest\
  \ I got from it. I never found the place again. I look for it at least a dozen of\
  \ times."
