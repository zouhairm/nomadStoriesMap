Text: "As Neil Armstrong, the first person to walk on the moon, once said, \u201C\
  That\u2019s one small step for man, one giant leap for mankind.\u201D I had my own\
  \ personal \u2018one small step\u2019 and \u2018giant leap\u2019 experience into\
  \ the unknown when I traveled to Haiti for a week with three families from France\
  \ who had sponsored kids in that country through Compassion International. \n  \
  \      In February of 2015, I met up with the families, Baynes, Apelbaums, and Destouets\
  \ at the destination airport in Haiti. A filmmaker by trade, I would be their personal\
  \ videographer filming their incredible journeys of meeting their sponsored kids\
  \ for the very first time. \n\tOur arrival in Haiti was not what I expected. The\
  \ poverty and the living conditions were shocking and heartbreaking to see. I knew\
  \ the country had been devastated by a terrible earthquake in 2010. What I didn\u2019\
  t know was that the funding and undertaking to improve the health and wellness of\
  \ the Haitian people had been slow going. Even though most of the debris had been\
  \ cleared, thousands of impoverished people were still living in wooden and tin\
  \ houses or camps \u2013 many of them without clean water, food, or clothing. It\
  \ was a bitter and harsh reality for me, but it sparked a new passion to capture\
  \ the heartfelt moments of the families spending time with their sponsored kids.\n\
  \tThe first time the Haitian kids visited us they were quite shy and unsure of their\
  \ sponsors. But their uncertainty was quickly laid to rest as the excited French\
  \ families introduced them to fun-filled days of soccer, fingernail painting, friendship\
  \ bracelets, and swimming. As somber expressions and quiet voices turned into smiles\
  \ and laughter of Haitian boys and girls playing with their new extended families,\
  \ I came to understand that sponsored kids rarely ever get to meet their sponsors\
  \ in person. The truth of that really hit me hard, but it also made me admire the\
  \ French families even more. For them to take the time to plan and save up enough\
  \ money to meet their kids, really touched me. It has inspired me to one day sponsor\
  \ kids and meet them personally as well!\n \tWe had the opportunity to visit their\
  \ homes, which was an eye-opening and humbling experience for all of us. The kids\
  \ were unnaturally quiet and I sensed that maybe a few of them felt ashamed and\
  \ embarrassed to have us see where they lived. Learning what their everyday life\
  \ was like, and seeing the troubles and hardships they had to face put into perspective\
  \ how much need there was in Haiti for provisions and aid to the many poverty-stricken\
  \ families. When we asked about schools and education, a Compassion International\
  \ staff member once said, \u201CIn Haiti, we\u2019re just trying to provide clean\
  \ water and food.\u201D\n        As the days went by, I observed, filmed, and wrote\
  \ about my experiences. I realized that color, race, nor background could hinder\
  \ these families from making their sponsored children feel safe, loved, and cherished.\
  \ It struck me that I wasn\u2019t witnessing several families, but one big family\
  \ made up of fathers, mothers, brothers, and sisters. \n        Having been an orphan\
  \ myself, later adopted, I know how powerful love can be, and because of that I\
  \ could relate to these kids on that level. Capturing on film precious moments like\
  \ the first time a child smiled or laughed, received a tender embrace or a word\
  \ of heartfelt gratitude, showed me that are caring people like those French families\
  \ and organizations like Compassion International. It gives me hope that others\
  \ will be inspired when they read this to join in and know the joy of reaching out\
  \ to the broken and forgotten.\n        Needless to say, parting between families\
  \ and their sponsored kids was not easy. After praying with them, giving gifts,\
  \ and hugs all around, they said farewell to their extended family. As we headed\
  \ out of the country, everyone was quiet. I could tell by their sad expressions\
  \ they were already missing their kids. In that moment, I knew in my heart and I\
  \ can say with all certainty that the French families, including me, hope that we\
  \ will one day be able to visit them again."
