Text: "As I sit upon the Luna Pyramid in Teotihuacan, Mexico, something released,\
  \ and my wings spread permanently. The air was warm, the tourists had dispersed,\
  \ the sun was setting beyond the endless horizon and I was alone. I was alone except\
  \ for a single hawk in the sky that kept quietly circling above me. An eerie silence\
  \ from such a powerful creature riding the currents of air nature had provided for\
  \ it to do so. A silhouette against the sun that brought Icarus to mind and a beautiful\
  \ wingspan calling my name while circling around me. The view from left to right\
  \ complimented with a four foot wing span that left my camera by my side for fear\
  \ of losing such a meaningful moment in my life. To observe and take in, not spectate\
  \ and lose the message before me. I reached into my pocket, and felt guitar picks,\
  \ pens, and a leather journal. I pulled out a pen and found a rare blank page to\
  \ write. \u201CThe energy released every desire from me, an infinite supply of nature\u2019\
  s well being, to take from the earth, without consent, I pity the day that we have\
  \ to repent, we\u2019ll feel the flames unless we fix, the mindless intrusion to\
  \ coexist, and not just us, the bloodline is real, it\u2019s seeped into the earth,\
  \ and provided our meals, If you cannot grasp and let go of the past, the knives\
  \ will remain, the pain will last, as you get deeper make peace with thyself, embrace\
  \ your fears, in your hands they'll melt, now you are free to know and to be, the\
  \ hawk alike the life of tree, It starts at the roots and slowly you\u2019ll grow,\
  \ you\u2019ll feel the cold, the rain, the snow, for it is the elements, so simple\
  \ to touch, yet you have forgotten to love so much.\u201D This was a departure from\
  \ thy former self. The hawk flew away as it was getting darker. The stars were like\
  \ stained glass backlit with candle light. The line of site and the eerie silence\
  \ taught me a lesson. I was alone. I missed the hawk in my presence, and the  realization\
  \ that if beneficial change is to take place, does logic not demand that we all\
  \ be a part of it in this world. We can\u2019t change the past or foresee the future\
  \ but If you think about it, life is an astonishing journey. We must travel. As\
  \ I look up, there\u2019s one that begins and ends in the sea of stars. While on\
  \ the road, sooner or later all travelers who endlessly chase the film photographs\
  \ of their dreams must eventually drift off into an eternal sleep. Old lives are\
  \ ended, New lives are begun, and running through it all, is a rocket, a special\
  \ rocket carrying upon for eternity. The dreams, hopes, ambitions, and the youth\
  \ of all humanity. Now, the flames of the Phoenix signal that the journey of another\
  \ youth is about to begin. I realized that \u201CYou\u2019re never too old until\
  \ your regrets take the place of your dreams,\" so travel and see as many place\
  \ as you can experience in this beautiful world.\n\nThank You for your time - @VascoNacho"
