Text: "The fox was up since early morning and was looking around but not really watching.\
  \ The fox needed to think and it was kind of hard finding the balance between will\
  \ and duty. The fox finally decided to wake up the crow. The crow was not really\
  \ sleeping deeply: it felt the noise of the thoughts and the dreams were of light\
  \ and yellow strings coming from a warm unidentified place. The two friends met\
  \ in less than twenty minutes and they headed west.\nUnknown air was fun, known\
  \ path was comfortable.\nThe small travelling breakfast was enough to cheer them\
  \ up and the chats of surprises and wind sounds were their companions for the road.\n\
  And the road became trail and the trail became dunes and the dunes became human.\
  \ \nThe sand dust was high thus the crow was able to fly low and feel the friendship\
  \ of the fox. The fox decided to fly and the crow held the breath and burst in a\
  \ good released laugh after seen the \u2018bismillah\u2019 flight of its friend.\
  \ They were now at the feet of a human mountain. The crow followed the fox\u2019\
  s footsteps and they rounded the huge rock of the past written in fingertips of\
  \ signals and sweats: straight parallel lines, small swallow circles and hollows\
  \ of wings and chirps were there to show their resistance to time, weather and humanity.\
  \ \n\u2018Let\u2019s go higher\u2019 \u2013said the fox and the crow followed. They\
  \ were now on the top of the world, or at least of that world, which was showing\
  \ them the old limestone-colored wadi once alive. They could follow the origin of\
  \ the wadi at their left and the continuity of the inexisted water to their right.\
  \ Like a calligraphy of time and space the wadi described them the inheritance of\
  \ humanity: a dam crossed perpendicularly the wadi itself and reached the shorter\
  \ rock in front of them, and continuing further. The voices of old caravans became\
  \ clearer; both the fox and the crow could hear them distinguishly."
