Text: I was lost. I could barely mind my home. Deeply rooted in my foundation, put
  to learn about the world. And then I say her. A small girl, in my heart, and I loved
  to the moons, and knew I had to have here again. She was the coolest fucking girl.
  My little fucking girl. So I went across the country, by share car, and ran away
  from my parents, who were being unforgiving. I ran straight past home,to an island
  called Cortez, and later found out what it was like to be abandoned, by god. And,
  let to drift away. I was nervous like hell,but then I ran, across the skies, across
  shores, searching for her, or him. My daughter, Cortex. I knew I had to have her
  back, even if it meant saving the world from the sun. She was moon, that Clareia,
  Samuel Best's daughter. That girl was a catch. There was no way she would be harmed,
  by her father's love. I took her halfway across the world, in a small town, where
  I would have her on mighty fall day. She was my princess, and my hero. We would
  inspire eachother together!!! Yes, and we would live to wealthy stars out in the
  world say out of lie. Hope roaming roaring, and free! Nyome, Chiquinquira Ponnambalam
  Kumary. Thanks for reading, likewise. Live life.
