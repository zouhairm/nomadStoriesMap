Text: "Ask someone what they wish for in life and you are most likely going to hear\
  \ \u2018I want to travel, to find love and to find happiness\u2019. As a joyful\
  \ person by nature, the latter had never been a problem for me and, a year ago,\
  \ about to go on a round-Europe trip, love seemed to be the only missing part. Which\
  \ girl would not dream of meeting the perfect and adventurous man while wandering\
  \ through the streets of London or sitting at a cafe in Paris? But \u2018no, that\
  \ is not quite how it happens in real life\u2019 said I to myself over and over.\
  \ Indeed, these two vivacious cities, despite their so appropriate magical sparkle\
  \ and refreshing air, were not my fairy godmother.\nWhen in Rome, though\u2026 I\
  \ left early for a visit to ancient massive constructions which had now fallen into\
  \ as stunning ruin. Thinking that, thousands of year ago, civilization could have\
  \ built all that amazed me inexplicably, and my deepest desire was to stare at such\
  \ view for ever. Like-minded tourists were also paralyzed by what stood in front\
  \ of them, observing the uncountable stones telling us a story better than any book\
  \ ever could. All tourists, except for one. Jake. At that moment, I did not know\
  \ him and now, months and months hence, I still doubt if I ever did. This Jake gazed\
  \ at me, ignoring everything else around him and slowly coming towards where I was.\
  \ His eyes, full of tenderness, finally met mine and immediately brought feelings\
  \ I used to think could not exist without words. Soon he was close enough to offer\
  \ me his hand and the short and curious introduction \u2018Hi, I\u2019m Jake, from\
  \ North America\u2019.\n\u2018Hi, Jake from North America\u2019 said I, followed\
  \ by my name and my home-continent \u2013 South America. A minute of silence. \u2018\
  Would you mind\u2026\u2019 he continued, \u2018taking a photo of me and my friends\
  \ in here?\u2019. Yes! I thought. I couldn\u2019t believe that was all about a photo.\
  \ \u2018No\u2019 I responded instead, surprised at how quickly these friends showed\
  \ up. No sooner had I helped them out then Jake and I found ourselves alone once\
  \ more. He, blushing, posed another question. \u2018And would you mind\u2026 being\
  \ in a photo with me?\u2019. I smiled, \u2018Not at all\u2019.\nThough we did take\
  \ a selfie together, I never got to see it. Jake\u2019s presence was immediately\
  \ required by his tour guide and, with shy apologies, he left me there. I watched\
  \ him go and disappear among the fascinated crowd that had just witnessed yet not\
  \ noticed our encounter, wondering what would have become of us, had he stayed.\
  \ Convinced that we would never meet again, I forced myself to continue with my\
  \ trip and forget about such incident, but those blue eyes\u2026 Oh, they still\
  \ haunt me, reminding me of how brief yet sweet it was to meet him.\nLater in the\
  \ evening, I found this charming old church on my way to the hotel and decided to\
  \ stop by. The one story had the height of at least three, its walls thoroughly\
  \ covered up with paintings and stained-glass windows. While I admired the beauty\
  \ of that place, I thought about nothing and everything at the same time, fractions\
  \ of memories coming and going out of my mind like an incessant boomerang. Then\
  \ I saw him \u2013 again! Waiting in line with the next group of people who would\
  \ come into the church, Jake was there, and he saw me, too. Inaudibly distant, I\
  \ gave him a delicate wave meaning both hello and goodbye, at what he waved back\
  \ just in time before being forced to move on by anxious visitors, the ones who\
  \ put us apart for the second time. And that was it.\nBack home, my friends demanded\
  \ to know all details of the trip and whether I had fallen in love with a special\
  \ place. I laughed and said, \u2018yes, with one\u2026\u2019 and in my thoughts\
  \ finished the sentence \u2018\u2026person\u2019. Little do they know that I live\
  \ now constantly dreaming about Jake, and as frequently wondering where I would\
  \ be right now if right then we had actually talked."
