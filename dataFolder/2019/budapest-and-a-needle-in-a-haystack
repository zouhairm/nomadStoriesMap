Text: "If someone had told me that in Budapest I would find everything I was looking\
  \ for, I would have been surprised. I must admit that from this side of the world,\
  \ in this latitude, in my head, Eastern Europe didn\xB4t mean more than ex-Soviet\
  \ countries, and the natural curiosity about how it was to live during the Communist\
  \ occupation. But luckily, fate had other plans for me in this city.\nWalking by\
  \ the Chain Bridge, admire the Danube and the beautiful historic buildings by its\
  \ shores make you think you are in a magical place, in a really special city, and\
  \ much more the locals. From the first day the hospitality and warmth of the Hungarians\
  \ caught my attention, serious but pleasant, when they asked me where I was from\
  \ and I answered \"Argentina\" their faces of enthusiasm for my land caused me something\
  \ between joy and in the background a bit of shame, probably they knew more about\
  \ my country than I knew about theirs. But there I was, ready to discover all of\
  \ this historic city, part of the great Astro-Hungarian empire, whose jewish community\
  \ was one of the most suffered during nazism, to finally being occupied by Stalin's\
  \ communist regime. I remember hearing about the revolution of the 56 and the resistance\
  \ of the people and felt moved to tears, connecting with that feeling of freedom,\
  \ hearing about that youth and that people who joined against all the suffering\
  \ they were being subjected. Is just that at the end of the day, I felt very close\
  \ to that story, maybe because the people who have been subjected have much more\
  \ in common than what it can mean to share a language. Something in this city told\
  \ me that everything in it was special and a strange feeling of familiarity, of\
  \ proximity flooded me as I walked through the Jewish quarter. \nBeing a tourist\
  \ and going to the most emblematic points of cities for having to follow an itinerary\
  \ often makes it difficult to connect with the local but fortunately, or by destiny,\
  \ I did it in the most wonderful way possible. When I saw him, something, a magnetism\
  \ maybe, attracted me. He appeared on my last night in the city to show me that\
  \ there are no barriers to feel close to someone, neither the language, nor the\
  \ distance, or although when it seems that the only thing in common is the simple\
  \ condition of human being, none of that you see at first sight is a limit to connect.\
  \ Our meeting began in a ruin bars, one of those that abound in the city, where\
  \ all tourist goes, and between words and presentations, answering the famous questionnaires\
  \ of first encounters \xBF\u201Cwhat\u2019s your name, where are you from, what\
  \ brings you here? \" and a walk to my hostel included something about this hungarian\
  \ guy intrigued me, as if he radiated mystery. Already the fact of knowing a local\
  \ in a bar full of tourists was like finding a needle in a haystack, that\u2019\
  s how special everything felt. And speaking of the same humanity we share, the injustices\
  \ of before and of now, I met a hungarian with whom I have much more in common than\
  \ with several argentines. By his side I discovered the city of the locals, I walked\
  \ through streets full of \u201CSzia\u201D and \u201CK\xF6sz\xF6n\xF6m\u201D, I\
  \ tasted the goulash made by the grandmothers and the richest wines of the region.\n\
  We spent that night together, one of the most amazing nights of my life, those encounters\
  \ where everything goes better than you can imagine. I remember him telling me how\
  \ lucky he was to meet me and wished it hadn't been on my last night, we both wanted\
  \ more time, more Budapest for ourselves. And the felling was so strong that 15\
  \ days later I returned to live my love story, the most beautiful that so far I\
  \ had live, which began with a simple hello from a local guy to a foreign girl in\
  \ a bar full of tourists."
