Text: "March 2017: \u201CSlovenia cannot give you a scholarship\u201D \u2013 this\
  \ phrase almost killed me. I remember this day like it was just yesterday, it was\
  \ the last day to submit my documents in Swiss university: I was pretty sure that\
  \ I would go to Ljubljana and I did not prepare all documents for Switzerland. I\
  \ just laid on my bed and I kept thinking over and over: \u201CSlovenia cannot give\
  \ you a scholarship\u201D. I did not feel frustration or pity. It was just emptiness\
  \ somewhere inside me. From the very beginning of my study, I dreamed leaving my\
  \ city \u2013 it was too tight for me. I always adored travelling, no matter where\
  \ and what for. I laid on my bed and understood that the possibility to leave was\
  \ slipping through my fingers. I lived as a robot for one month. Home. University.\
  \ Training. And only one thought on my mind: \u201CSlovenia cannot give you a scholarship\u201D\
  .\n\n\u201CWe will find something\u201D \u2013 this phrase prevented me from falling\
  \ into depression. My pen-pal said it, we met online and never saw each other. He\
  \ was Italian and he once suggested to look for something in his city, Brescia.\
  \ I had never heard about this city before. I decided to open the University of\
  \ Brescia site, without any hope. I went through the scholarship page and saw an\
  \ offer of Master\u2019s degree for non-EU students. I understood, that I fit on\
  \ each criteria for applying. \u201CThis scholarship will be mine, at any cost\u201D\
  \ I thought. I prepared all documents, translated all my diplomas and awards. I\
  \ sent it and waited.\n\nAt the end of May I flew to the capital city of my country\
  \ and started to prepare the necessary documents in the Italian embassy, even without\
  \ knowing whether I would have or not this scholarship.\nWhile I was there, I received\
  \ an email from the University. \u201CWe are pleased to inform You, that You are\
  \ eligible for our scholarship\u201D \u2013 this phrase gave me back my wings. I\
  \ could not believe it. I felt the happiest person in the universe. All Summer I\
  \ flew back and forth from my city to the capital, making a pile of documents. It\
  \ was a hard and tiring procedure, but I always remembered that it was my goal and\
  \ I could not give up because of some papers.\nAlmost half-year was spent only on\
  \ this \u201Cleap into the unknown\u201D preparation. And the leap happened in September.\
  \ I took a plane and flew into the unknown. Yes, I had been abroad before. Yes,\
  \ I studied in foreign universities under the Erasmus program. But Erasmus and permanent\
  \ studying are two different things: an Erasmus student knows that, sooner or later,\
  \ she will go back home. There are other feelings on permanent study. Yes, I was\
  \ afraid. I was afraid, that I will not pass admission test. I was afraid that I\
  \ will not adapt to the Italian lifestyle. I had two flights with a night between\
  \ them, and all this time I just thought and thought\u2026\n\nI thought about running\
  \ away. Running away to a country where science matters. Where \u201Cscientist\u201D\
  \ and \u201Cuniversity professor\u201D are respected professions. Where I can tell\
  \ my opinion without fearing that I will be arrested for it. Where politicians sometimes\
  \ change. Italy is not an ideal country. I started to understand it when I was on\
  \ the plane, I also understand it now. I see the problems of this country, but I\
  \ can live with it. When I read news from my country or speak with my parents there,\
  \ I understand more and more how right my decision was.\n\nSeptember 2017: my leap\
  \ into the unknown had just started. Milan Malpensa airport. I go through custom\
  \ controls, get out on the arrival hall and hug my pen-pal, whom I see for the first\
  \ time. I did not know at the time that 2 years later we will be married.\n\nI miss\
  \ people and places. But not my country. I have no nostalgia. It hurts me to see\
  \ what happened with my country, but I do not want to go back. It was the right\
  \ leap into the unknown and it is not over yet."
