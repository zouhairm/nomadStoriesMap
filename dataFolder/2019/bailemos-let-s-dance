Text: "Seville, located in the Andalusia region of Spain, is famous for flamenco,\
  \ a ferocious style of dance with gypsy roots.  On a recent trip, I planned a full\
  \ day of flamenco: a dance lesson in the morning and a performance by professional\
  \ flamenco artists at night.  \xA1Vamos!  \n     There are several flamenco studios\
  \ in Seville, an elegant city with centuries-old churches and monument-filled squares;\
  \ I choose Juan Polvillo (Calle Sol, 84).  Upon arrival, I was welcomed by Juan\
  \ Polvillo himself who offered me a faldita (little skirt) and led me to a tickle\
  \ trunk full of shoes.  Once outfitted, Juan introduced me to Marta, the young lady\
  \ who would be instructing me and suffering through my best efforts at stomping\
  \ my feet while trying to appear serious.  \n     Walking through the studio, I\
  \ could see, or rather, hear a class taking place due to the unmistakeable galloping\
  \ created by a multitude of heavy heels.  I watched for a moment,  appreciating\
  \ how flamenco, unlike many other styles of dance, attracts women of all ages, shapes\
  \ and sizes.  One does not need \u201Ca dancer\u2019s body\u201D to be able to give\
  \ a sublime flamenco performance.  Of course, a dancer must be capable of executing\
  \ the movements with precise timing and technique, but it\u2019s her personal expression\
  \ that gives the performance its texture.  Later, I asked one of the participants\
  \ why she danced flamenco.  She replied, \u201CMe ayuda expresarme.\u201D (\u201C\
  It helps me express myself.\u201D)\n     Marta started with a basic step, hitting\
  \ the ground first with the ball of the foot, then the heel (toe, heel, toe, heel\u2026\
  ).  Next she taught me how to simultaneously coordinate upper body movement.  Flamenco\
  \ dancers must be able to coordinate the upper and lower body, move them independently\
  \ and move them differently.  While the upper body moves slowly and sensuously,\
  \ the fingers tracing intricate patterns, the lower body is aggressive in maintaining\
  \ the rhythm with sharp strikes against the floor.  Delicate and powerful.  \n \
  \    We practiced a few simple combinations to music.  Marta even incorporated sections\
  \ in which I could improvise a little (such as when I slowly turned on the spot\
  \ while dramatically raising my arms out to the sides and then overhead, rotating\
  \ my wrists and extending my fingers).  By the end of the hour, I wasn\u2019t exactly\
  \ stage-ready, but I had gained a deeper appreciation of the difficultly of flamenco\
  \ dancing.  \n     Later that night, I headed to Casa de la Memoria (Calle Cuna,\
  \ 6), one of the more respected venues for flamenco shows in Seville known to feature\
  \ up-and-comers on the scene.  It\u2019s located in the heart of Seville, not far\
  \ from Metropol Parasol, a wavy and sponge-like wooden structure that locals call\
  \ las setas (the mushrooms).  \n     Casa de le Memoria offers two shows per night\
  \ (19:30 and 21:00,  \u20AC18) in its intimate space.  Performers are few: one female\
  \ dancer, one male dancer, a vocalist and a guitarist.  The show began with offstage\
  \ clapping which grew louder as the performers made their way to the stage.  The\
  \ guitarist took his seat and calmly improvised for a few minutes, lulling the audience\
  \ into quiet attention.  Then the vocalist, thought by many to be the beating heart\
  \ of the performance, began to sing, his voice coiling through the air like smoke.\
  \ \n     The stage was worn and scratched for good reason.  The dancers held nothing\
  \ back as they hit the boards aggressively with their thunderous feet.  The female\
  \ dancer wore a pained expression on her face as she stomped, clapped and snapped,\
  \ whipping herself around to face one way and then, in a split second, the other.\
  \  Watching her fingers, which were so extended that they almost appeared to bend\
  \ backwards, I remembered how Marta had explained to me that one of the differences\
  \ between the male and female dancers is that the females\u2019 fingers articulate\
  \ while the males\u2019 are held closely together.  The two dancers danced together\
  \ several times, alternating grabbing the focus of the show, until they were exhausted.\
  \  I was, too."
