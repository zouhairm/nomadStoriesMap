Text: "People gave me frowns. Even recommended I not go. Chile is that skinny country\
  \ in a south America, right? My mother asked me. Yeah it was. But it was like I\
  \ could feel it reaching out to me, calling my name. I\u2019m not much of a traveler,\
  \ that\u2019s for sure. But the people and places I visited changed my life, that\u2019\
  s for sure. Heated romances, random friends from all over the globe, even an enemy\
  \ or two. Santiago, the Mountains, even the old fishing village that didn\u2019\
  t even have a name. It was like every single minute in that place mattered, not\
  \ just to me, but to the universe too. Every word spoken, every shared look, every\
  \ shout on the street seemed like it was coming from greater expanse. \nI left for\
  \ Chile the day I turned 18, so about halfway through my senior year. Of course\
  \ people disapproved. This is crazier than a gap year, my mother exclaimed, but\
  \ that wasn\u2019t true. Gap years are for people who finish High School. I couldn\u2019\
  t seem to find even that little motivation. Travel was calling my name and one way\
  \ or another, I was going to follow it. \nMy suitcase weighed 13 pounds. That\u2019\
  s all I brought. What little money I had was put into a plane ticket and then I\
  \ spun a globe. The first two spins put me deep in the ocean, where there wasn\u2019\
  t even an island nearby to catch me. My third try landed me in Chile. I remember\
  \ that grasping smell, the beauty of the Spanish language, the sights of simplicity\
  \ and even struggle. \nI didn\u2019t choose some grand city like Rome to travel\
  \ to. I chose a dirt-mound if you will. Dusty roads, small cottage homes, shacks\
  \ for grocery stores. I\u2019ll be honest, my first instinct was to turn around\
  \ and go home, where I had old friends, a clean bed, and parents who paid for anything\
  \ I wanted. This was new territory, something dangerous. \nI found my way to the\
  \ small home of the Juarez\u2019 family, who had offered me a whole room in their\
  \ house for my first week, in return for nothing. They took me in, fed me, and then\
  \ told me where my next turn should be.  Cordillera de los Andes, the soft-spoken\
  \ abuela said to me. Oh the Andes Mountains for sure, the little children said in\
  \ their proudest English. And within days, I was packed, gone, and already in a\
  \ small village right outside the foothills of the mountain. There, I stayed with\
  \ a young man, two years older than me. I can admit we were taken with each other,\
  \ and he immediately became my tour guide, companion, and very close friend. And\
  \ by the next week, we were starting our journey. \nSebastian was his name and he\
  \ was tall and dark. He was the village strong man, helping all the little abuelas\
  \ with their heavy loads and aiding every man in town with their herds. He was not\
  \ the village Gaston. He had, in fact, the opposite effect on the young women there.\
  \ He was calloused and tan and muscles, which showed his work ethic; to the young\
  \ women, however, that translated to poor. A man who works in their village must\
  \ have very little money, so the young girl\u2019s desired white, small, soft boys\
  \ who never lifted a finger. But they all ended up tan in the end from working for\
  \ their wives. No villager could escape it, even me with my fair skin could not\
  \ escape the summer sun. I browned like a marshmallow under that cloudless sky and\
  \ it became apparent by the tan lines that grew stronger and stronger. \nBy March\
  \ 3, we were off. Each of us carrying a backpack, we headed up the foothills. It\
  \ wasn\u2019t before too long that we stopped for water at a spring. A ghostly image\
  \ appeared in my mind and I knew I was in desperate need for water. I\u2019m so\
  \ thirsty, In seeing things I said. You don\u2019t believe in spirits, do you? Sebastian\
  \ asked. I don\u2019t think so I replied. That\u2019s probably for the best he said\
  \ back. And we continued our chilling adventure."
