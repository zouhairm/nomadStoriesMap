Text: "I have been hesitant to write this as I feel I\u2019m begrudgingly becoming\
  \ the expat I never thought I would be. I also didn\u2019t want to write this until\
  \ I was \u201Csorted\u201D, but time is ticking and I\u2019m still not sorted so\
  \ I won\u2019t bore you with details of \u201Cwhat you should know before you go\u201D\
  , because I still don\u2019t know. I don\u2019t even have a proper bank account,\
  \ I frequently forget to tap-off my Oyster card, and I am still predominately unemployed.\
  \ Nevertheless, it feels high time to have a good old rant. \n\nBefore moving to\
  \ London, I read countless articles, blogs, and personal messages from friends living\
  \ in London about the struggles of moving to London. But honestly, nothing prepares\
  \ you more to live in London than actually living in London (even if you\u2019ve\
  \ temporarily lived in London before!). \n\nA few months ago, many people responded\
  \ to the suggestion that I would move to London with \u201Coh, of course you\u2019\
  re moving to London, that\u2019s what everyone does\u201D. I also heard people say\
  \ London is unoriginal or a cop out. I guess I thought I should therefore have it\
  \ all together. In reality, however, I have found the transition of moving to London\
  \ pretty challenging. \n\nWe are clocking up to 100 days in London and it\u2019\
  s been a pretty tough ride. Mind you, that\u2019s an eternity when you\u2019re unemployed\
  \ and bordering on broke. This city is cold, hard and grey. At times it feels completely\
  \ overwhelming and unkind. \n\nSure you could say it\u2019s situational - I haven\u2019\
  t had the best of luck on the employment front and while we started off with a bang,\
  \ our funds quickly dwindled as we set up a flat in London. We forked out a fortune\
  \ to live in a lounge-less share house, the tube costs an arm and leg, and you\u2019\
  d be lucky to go to the toilet without spending a penny. \n\nOf course there are\
  \ plenty of things to do in London, you only have to Google \u2018London\u2019 to\
  \ be inundated with lists of weird activities \u201Con a budget\u201D, but no doubt\
  \ you\u2019ll be on the tube for an hour before you get anywhere and you\u2019ll\
  \ be freezing your tits off if you want to partake in free pass times. I acknowledge\
  \ many of the museums are also free but there are only so many times you can look\
  \ at a dusty whale.\n\nThe weather doesn\u2019t help, I suppose. Nor does the limited\
  \ hours of sunlight. Seasonal Affective Disorder is a sure thing! You go to work\
  \ \u2013 it\u2019s dark, you come home \u2013 it\u2019s dark. It\u2019s a wonder\
  \ anyone gets anything done.\n\nYes, the tube is pretty impressive with up to 543\
  \ trains whizzing underground, commuting 5 million passengers per day. But to frank\
  \ \u2013 the tube disgusts me! Not only are you exposed to pollution worse than\
  \ smoking a cigarette, people think it is okay to cough without covering their mouths,\
  \ listen to music without headphones, and rub up against you. People also have a\
  \ tendency to barge in front of you, run through the station as if another train\
  \ wont come for another 2 minutes, and not bathe or wash their clothes.\n\nThe idea\
  \ of moving to London initially (as opposed to somewhere else in the UK) was to\
  \ fall into a sea of vast employment opportunities. While there does seem to be\
  \ a number of vacancies, to actually start a job has been a series of unfortunate\
  \ non-events.\n\nOn a positive note, thankfully I have had a few weeks of soul-destroying\
  \ work to keep me afloat.  \nMost of this time was spent working as a receptionist\
  \ where my mind was numb for 9 hours and I spent the day wanting to chew my own\
  \ arm off (admittedly only because I\u2019m not accustomed to front of house where\
  \ it is uncouth to eat at your desk and I need hourly feeds). At \xA38 per hour,\
  \ tasks included answering the phone whilst praying I could remember which company\
  \ I was at, making the directors coffee.... \n \nTBC"
