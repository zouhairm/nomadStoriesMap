Text: "Growing up in South Africa I have always admired the different cultures and\
  \ diversity in our country. I have travelled most parts of my country meeting new\
  \ people and most of all exporing their different lifestyles. I would say I am a\
  \ born explorer and travelling makes me tick. It has always been my dream to travel\
  \ the world, but due to financial constrains I am still working on this dream, however\
  \ I embrace the two international trips that I have been to Tanzania and Canada.\
  \ \n\nIn the year 2016 was fortunate enough to take on my first trip to St Johns\
  \ Canada. I was invited to present my MSc work at a conservation conference. This\
  \ has been to date one of the best things ever to happen in my life.  The highlight\
  \ of the trip was the whole trip. My trip started on the 28th July from Cape Town\
  \ International Airport to OR  Tambo International Airport in Johannesburg. As a\
  \ norm to our Cape Town winter days, the day started with a cold rainy showers which\
  \ excalated as the hours passes by. I was greatful for the rain as it always significe\
  \ good luck in my life. On my arrival at the OR Tambo I was told that the flight\
  \ to London Hethrow has been cancelled due to bad weather conditions. Oopsy! Little\
  \ did I know that this was gonna add fun to my travel. We got booked to a very luxurious\
  \ hotel just outside the airport, and the new flight was scheduled to take off the\
  \ following morning at 7 o clock. \n\nEarly morning on the 29th, I had to prepare\
  \ for my longest flight trip ever in my life. I had already wrapped my luggage bags\
  \ the previous day before I received the news of flight delay, so this meant that\
  \ I will have to repeat my previous day clothes. Anyways nobody new me in this flight\
  \ I guess. So the trip was perfect the whole trip took 12 hours and we arrived in\
  \ Hethrow at 7 o clock evening.  On my arrival I was told that the fligh to Canada\
  \ has already departed two hours ago, meaning I have to wait for the next flight\
  \ the following day. Being a first time traveller I went to get my luggage at the\
  \ baggage collection site, I waited for my bag but nothing showed up.  As I was\
  \ getting frustrated I went to the airport staff and enquire about this. I was \
  \ told that nothing can be done as the system cannot locate my bag yet. Little did\
  \ I know that when you checked in  your luggage for long connecting flights, one\
  \ receives their bags at their final deatination. I could not make calls back to\
  \ SA and my budget could not allow me to buy new clothes for the whole trip. Although\
  \ I was a bit disappointed I was still excited about the whole trip. I sent my mentor\
  \ an email yo inform her that I lost my bag. She responded quickly and promised\
  \ to buy some underwears and few clothes for the conference as she was coming to\
  \ the conference two days later. \n\nThe following day I waited at the airport my\
  \ flight to Canada, St Johns Airport. The flight was on time and it took 6 hours\
  \ to arrive on Canada. Now I had to get adjusted to different time zones. It was\
  \ so funny when I made calls home and it was so confusing as the body is tired and\
  \ needs to rest but it is still quiete early on this part of the world. \n\nAt arrival\
  \ at the hotel, my room was cancelled as I did not make any arrangement following\
  \ my flights delays. And the hotel was fully booked as it was also the conference\
  \ venueOMG! This time I almost cried, why is this trip full of surprises!  I could\
  \ not afford to stay at a nearby hotel and I just needed to rest. Finally the hotel\
  \ manager came to apologise and suggested that I sleep at a neglected room which\
  \ was not in use due to its condition. The room did not have a working shower. My\
  \ best travel experience!"
