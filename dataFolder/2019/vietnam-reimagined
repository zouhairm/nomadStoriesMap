Text: "One winter I embarked on a trip to Vietnam. I landed at Ho Chi Minh City (Saigon),\
  \ which is a 4 hour flight away from my hometown; Jakarta, Indonesia. Traveling\
  \ within Southeast Asia is familiar to me. There are only a few differences within\
  \ each Southeast Asian countries and we do share a lot of common cultures. However,\
  \ Vietnam is different. They have a rich history and a distinct political condition\
  \ that sets them apart from the rest of Southeast Asia. Being a socialist country,\
  \ it made me assume that life in Vietnam is far stricter than it is back home. \n\
  \nI observed how the Vietnamese live; there's a big difference between the northern\
  \ and southern part of the country. People in the north live a tighter life. Winters\
  \ are colder; and with Hanoi being the centre of the government, people tend to\
  \ live like what the government have set them out for. On the contrary, people in\
  \ the south live a life with more freedom, and Saigon is so different than what\
  \ I thought it would be. The city is so modern, people living in metropolitan conditions\
  \ and they have more exposure to the International scene. \n\nVisiting both cities\
  \ made me see the contrast. You are most likely to see hip cafes, shopping malls\
  \ and tall skyscrapers in sunny Saigon. The people dresses chic and modern, updated\
  \ to the latest fashion. Motor taxis and cabs rushing down the main roads, constructions\
  \ everywhere as the city rebuilds itself as Southeast Asia's new metropolitan. Up\
  \ north in Hanoi, the people dress moderately. You'll see less cafes but more street\
  \ vendors selling you the most authentic Vietnamese dishes. Buildings are either\
  \ old or renovated, but kept to their original style. It is more grounded and cultured\
  \ up in Hanoi. \n\nDifferences aside, Vietnam is rich in culture and history. It's\
  \ what shapes the Vietnamese people. From the beautiful Ao Dai attire to the insanely\
  \ delicious foods, one cannot get enough of everything they could offer. One thing\
  \ travelers must try in Vietnam would be their Vietnamese Coffee (Ca Phe Sua Da).\
  \ Strong black coffee with enough condensed milk to get all the flavors out, the\
  \ best thing I have tried throughout my trip. Not only that, but they have a bunch\
  \ of sceneries to enjoy too. From the snowy Sapa Hills to the majestic Ha Long Bay\
  \ up north and the historic Mekong Delta down south, Vietnam is all about the balance\
  \ of contrast. \n\nLittle things like coffee to great sceneries makes up their whole\
  \ identity as a country. Vietnamese living in such political pressure and with the\
  \ younger generations trying to breakthrough of their old and comes out of their\
  \ own and create something modern and globally impactful. That's how Vietnam inspires\
  \ me, they always make the best out of what they have and turn it into something\
  \ that could flash a smile."
