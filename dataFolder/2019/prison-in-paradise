Text: "In Australia, the stars are upside down. This fact requires your definition\
  \ of \"right side up\" to be based on how they appear in the Northern Hemisphere,\
  \ but it's still more or less true. They're upside down and reversed from left to\
  \ right compared with the stars nearly ninety percent of the population of Earth\
  \ looks up at every night. I loved the idea that something as constant and familiar\
  \ as the night sky could be rendered new and disorienting. I broke the lease on\
  \ my Brooklyn apartment and bought a one-way ticket.\n\nI had only been in Melbourne\
  \ for a few days when I first heard the words \"Manus\" and \"Naru.\" I was strolling\
  \ through the city's central business district, called the CBD by locals, when I\
  \ came upon a protest. The front steps of the State Library were filled with people\
  \ holding signs bearing those two unfamiliar words. I learned \"Manus\" and \"Naru\"\
  \ are the names of two remote islands in the Pacific ocean where Australia runs\
  \ off-shore immigration detention centers. \n\nWhen migrants and refugees desperate\
  \ enough to try their luck on the open ocean arrive by boat in Australia, they are\
  \ greeted by what the country's conservative party calls its \"Pacific Solution.\"\
  \ They are shipped off to one or the other of these islands. If the tone-deaf name\
  \ of the plan wasn't enough of a sign that this policy might've received hearty\
  \ approval from the Third Reich, the details clear up any ambiguity. These \"resettlement\
  \ facilities\" bear more resemblance to concentration camps than any kind of modern\
  \ immigration center, especially considering very little \"resettling\" ever occurs.\
  \ People languish in them for years. The conditions within them are predictably\
  \ appalling; malnutrition, sexual abuse, violence and suicide attempts are rampant.\n\
  \nThanks to a different origin point and method of transport, my journey to this\
  \ country had been unfathomably different from theirs. This thought followed me\
  \ everywhere I went, from the picturesque Victorian storefronts on Nicholson street,\
  \ with their ornate wrought iron embellishments, to the Blue Fairy penguin colony\
  \ in St. Kilda beach, where the distant city lights frame the mouth of Port Phillip\
  \ Bay. \n\nThe next time there was a protest, I was there on purpose. A protester\
  \ showed me a photo of Naru. It showed beautiful beaches and palm trees and chain\
  \ link fences with barbed wire on top. Someone joked that if you had to be imprisoned,\
  \ you could do worse than to be jailed in paradise. I thought that somehow, the\
  \ idyllic setting only made it all that much worse. \n\nThe legacy of colonialism\
  \ in Australia is omnipresent. You can't throw a stone in Melbourne's CBD without\
  \ hitting a statue, street, building, bench or park named for some genocidal British\
  \ general. But, despite the dark cloud of history that hangs over the place, and\
  \ the foreboding reminder that history often repeats itself, Melbourne is undeniably\
  \ charming. Tall, white gum trees line the streets. Cockatoos and Australian King-Parrots\
  \ make bizarre, guttural sounds from lamp posts and Acacia branches. Trams glide\
  \ back and forth from Flinders Street Station. At dusk, thousands of fruit bats\
  \ leave their colonies on the outskirts of the city and take flight, their leathery\
  \ wings silhouetted against the rapidly darkening sky. \n\nA few months after arriving\
  \ in Melbourne I went to Port Douglas, a place on the eastern side of a piece of\
  \ Australia that juts out into the pacific ocean. In Port Douglas, the jungle gives\
  \ way to perfect, white, sandy coastline. One night, I took an evening stroll on\
  \ the beach. As I stood with my feet in the still-warm sand, staring out over the\
  \ dark ocean, I realized I must be looking in the direction of Manus and Naru, out\
  \ beyond Papua New Guinea. Here, in the North of Australia, I was the closest to\
  \ those islands that I'd likely ever be. \n\nAbove me, stars twinkled. They were\
  \ those curiously inverted constellations I'd travelled so far to see. Looking up\
  \ at them, I imagined their bright lights framed by barbed wire and chain link.\
  \ I tried not to think about how it was only through an accident of fate that, to\
  \ me, this beach was paradise and not a prison."
