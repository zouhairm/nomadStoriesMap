Text: "\u201CWherever you go, go with all of your heart. You\u2019ll never know where\
  \ the wind takes you. Always remember; the journey is home\u201D said my friend.\n\
  \nI thought I wasn\u2019t brave enough, but then a week later I jumped on a plane,\
  \ flying to another island. Gili Trawangan, a tiny island of the northwest coast\
  \ of Lombok in West Nusa Tenggara, was on my top list at that time. Soon as I had\
  \ arrived in Lombok island, I went to the harbour by joining a group of tourists\
  \ who also wanted to go to Gili Trawangan. It took me about 2 hours with moderate\
  \ traffic until we finally arrived at Bangsal harbour.\n\nLater on, I found myself\
  \ on a fast boat with another group of people. That was my first experience being\
  \ on a boat. There were many people in such a small boat; from the local people\
  \ who carried their groceries until the tourists who carried their backpacks. A\
  \ wave of nausea hit me constantly. An English woman in her middle age with brunette\
  \ hair and freckles on her cheeks, sat besides me. She might feel sorry about me\
  \ so she cheered me up by telling her story. Her name is Olivia, she had just returned\
  \ from her trip in Kuta beach Lombok, \u201CHave you been there?\u201D she asked.\
  \ \u201CIt has small hills around the beach. You should go there.\u201D\nWe chatted\
  \ a lot until all of us arrived in the island. Thanks to Olivia because I quite\
  \ enjoyed my boat trip without feeling sick for the entire half an hour. The smell\
  \ of the sea with a mixture of strong wind blew me off. Some of the locals offered\
  \ me a place to stay. I could feel the island greeted me nicely.\nThat afternoon,\
  \ I decided to enjoy my coconut drink under a big palm tree. People passed me by.\
  \ I stared at the horizon, a picture of my hometown came in my mind. I was far away\
  \ from home, a hundred miles away. I imagined what would I do at this hour if I\
  \ were still in that big city. I took my last sip and did a little walk from the\
  \ beach to my homestay in the east side of the island. \n\nSome days I rode a bike\
  \ and some evenings I let myself walk around the entire tiny island (since motorized\
  \ vehicles are not allowed in Gili Trawangan). On the west side, I could see some\
  \ luxury resorts, restaurants and bars. A bit different with the north and south\
  \ sides which are relatively quiet. Walking along on the shore barefoot, seeing\
  \ the bautiful reflection of moonbeams on the sea, and hearing the waves crash one\
  \ another were my favorite things to do for the past three days.\nOn the fourth\
  \ day of my staying in Gili, I packed my bag and ready to go home. I bought my ticket\
  \ back to Lombok island. Again, I joined a group of people who wanted to go back\
  \ to Lombok. Some of them were going to the airport and some of them were going\
  \ to beautiful beaches in the south of Lombok. The driver asked my destination.\
  \ Right at that time I recalled two conversations; with my hometown friend and Olivia.\n\
  \n\u201CI think I want to spend a night in Kuta,\u201D I smiled.\n\nI opened the\
  \ car window, I felt the wind blew my hair smoothly. What a warm greeting. \nI guess\
  \ I agreed with my friend; the journey is home."
