Text: "Africa Yetu\n\nJambo!\nIt means \u201Cwelcome\u201D in Swahili, the official\
  \ language of Tanzania.\nAfrica Yetu means Our Africa, the Africa living inside\
  \ us.\nAfrica Yetu art and education. \n\nOnce upon a time...\nLike the very first\
  \ time, although it happened a million times before. This story is about someone\
  \ travelling to a new place; and there I was leaving Bahia, heading to Tanzania\
  \ Yetu!\n\nTo be precise, we arrived at Kilimanjaro airport, so we got the chance\
  \ to see the top of the mountain...\nI felt like that was some sort of welcome greeting.\n\
  Whilst I was crossing the Atlantic I realized what I was about to embark: not just\
  \ a mere photographic adventure, it was much more than that. Somehow I felt like\
  \ coming back to a place that had something in common with my inner self, a place\
  \ arising good feelings and good vibes; such a profound and spiritual experience.\n\
  \nBecause of this, I realized I had no choice but bringing this project forward\
  \ and pass on my own experience to everyone. This way, they would be able to feel\
  \ the good vibes of the African soil.\nThe exhibition is like a dream coming true.\
  \ It turns into a vivid trajectory in the shape of a diary: from the arrival in\
  \ Tanzania, East Africa to encountering wild animals face to face, the chance to\
  \ take pictures of them and being able to feel their incredible energy!\n\nOur adventure\
  \ starts in Arusha, a city in the northern part of the country. We then moved to\
  \ the national parks of Tarangire, Ngorongroro and Serengeti. The city is located\
  \ in a region holding the same name in northern Tanzania, two steps away from the\
  \ the Kenyan border, about half a million people live there.  It is located next\
  \ to Mount Kilimanjaro, 5895 metres high,  it is Africa\u2019s highest peak. This\
  \ strategic position turns the city into one of the key starting points to explore\
  \ the country\u2019s largest parks.\n\nLocated in the Manyara region, the Tarangire\
  \ National Park it is the sixth largest park in Tanzania. It is well known for its\
  \ gigantic baobabs and herds of elephants. When you visit the Tarangire, you can\
  \ opt to stay by the Manyara, a huge alkaline lake which dividing the Manyara and\
  \ Arusha regions. then we set out for the endless plain, but before we arrived we\
  \ made a stop. Located on the border between the Serengeti and the Ngorongoro, Lake\
  \ Ndutu is home to several species; a large open space, ideal to spot the biggest\
  \ savanna beasts in motion.\nThe Ngorongoro crater is the home of various species\
  \ and the cradle of the Maasai people living between Tanzania and Kenya. The Maasai\
  \ people migrated from Egypt to the border between Tanzania and Kenya over 10 thousand\
  \ years ago. They found their promised land in the Ngorongoro crater; yet, they\
  \ continue to roam in between these two countries. To finalize the trip of a spectacular\
  \ way we were in the serengeti, and we saw hundreds of wild species, one of the\
  \ largest natural parks of the African continent, the Serengeti is home to the most\
  \ popular species. Serengeti is a Maasai word meaning \u201CEndless plain\u201D\
  .\n\nMine was a self-learning experience. \nI saw a tormented people, yet cheerful\
  \ and hard-working. Meeting wild beasts face to face was priceless!\nIt wasn\u2019\
  t just about taking pictures of wildlife or travelling around an unusual place,\
  \ it was much more! It felt like I was recovering part of our legacy."
