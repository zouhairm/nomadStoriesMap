Text: "Have you ever experienced anything different during your visits to your native\
  \ place? \nBeing born and brought up in Dubai, every summer my bags were always\
  \ packed to visit my hometown in India. Although it\u2019s been on my bucket list,\
  \ I have never travelled elsewhere hence; India was the only great escape from the\
  \ hustle and bustle of city life. The place where I hail from and the place where\
  \ I reside are poles apart. Deolali, located in a district of Maharashtra, is a\
  \ small hill station with a population of roughly 50,000 people. A restful place\
  \ where one has the luxury of time to witness every moment. During my teenage years\
  \ I never felt the \u201Cholidaying experience\u201D. School breaks were unexciting\
  \ and soon to follow, college breaks became even more boring. During one of my university\
  \ breaks I had decided to put an end to such meaningless trips. Little was I aware\
  \ that this journey would change my perspective completely.\nDeolali is notable\
  \ for its picturesque view and surreal spots. The highland is surrounded by peaked\
  \ mountains and lush greenery that high temperatures atmosphere is rare. I always\
  \ had the privilege of visiting this place in the months of July and August which\
  \ is the rainy season. On a typical afternoon when I decided to ride my bike and\
  \ explore more of this region, I accidentally took a wrong turn and landed on a\
  \ narrow path, lush foliage. The sloped area had silenced the noises of vehicles\
  \ but allowed itself to be serenaded by the chirping of the birds and the sound\
  \ of the wind. There was something about this place that precluded me from taking\
  \ my feet off the ground, so I parked my bike in a corner and stood on the road\
  \ for a while. As I rested myself I enjoyed the feel of the breeze that swept over\
  \ my face. Inhaling the fragrance of petrichor that signaled the oncoming of the\
  \ rain and before I knew water droplets kissed my face and gradually the gates of\
  \ heaven opened. I surrendered myself to the tranquility of the moment as every\
  \ cell of my body danced to the beat emanating from the raindrops touching the ground.\
  \ I felt connected with the universe and wished to be lost here till eternity. I\
  \ stood there with arms open embracing every second till Mother Nature decided to\
  \ cease the waterfall. After a while as I opened my eyes, everything looked crystal\
  \ clear and for the first time solitude was truly a bliss. Silence had spread all\
  \ over. Cuckoo was now at peace as it yearned for this moment to quench its long\
  \ thirst. Mother Nature bestowed its humbleness on every species present. A moment\
  \ of glee was common amongst all of us be it the dry grass, the thirsty bird or\
  \ until this moment, my indifference towards my surroundings. This sole memory of\
  \ my native place has carved a niche deep down within my heart and shall always\
  \ be cherished when I visit again. To retain my enthusiasm, I further took a trip\
  \ to discover every corner of this known yet foreign place, I visited and unraveled\
  \ the beauty which was omnipresent but I  just didn\u2019t take time to notice before.\
  \ Apart from the usual sightseeing areas like the temple hill, sacred churches and\
  \ artillery museums; this place also has serene spots where early morning sun rays\
  \ filter through dense trees as if the sky as if the heavens themselves had chosen\
  \ to shine on you. \nI also happened to join an inspirited old age group who held\
  \ laughter therapy sessions, by raising our hands high up in the air with exuberance,\
  \ in great a guffaw  we released all the world-weariness and rejoiced the moment.\
  \ In contrast to my birth place, Dubai, I have learnt a lot from Deolali, where\
  \ even the oldies can be a tough competition to the youth, adding life to mundane\
  \ days.\nDeolali has never failed to enlighten me with a new experience every time\
  \ I visit. It has been a shelter for old age groups and hits the pause button in\
  \ the lives of those who are running with every tick of the clock."
