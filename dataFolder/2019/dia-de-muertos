Text: "Because of its proximity to Halloween in the Christian calendar, many outside\
  \ observers think Dia de Muertos (DDM) is part of that but they are actually separate\
  \ events with DDM having its origins in pre-Hispanic tradition with the Catholic\
  \ conquistadors then keeping on the festival, albeit in a mutated form, to encourage\
  \ conversion, with the pope eventually recognising the event as a Catholic one as\
  \ well.\n\nOne thing to stress is that these are definitely jovial celebrations,\
  \ ones of remembrance yes but there is revelry in the happiness of those memories\
  \ and is seen as a way of communing with the departed. \nThe streets and shops are\
  \ filled with brightly coloured decorations and banners, with many hanging paper\
  \ lace bunting in any affordable space. Inside homes, by tombs, occasionally places\
  \ of works or in the streets of certain important figures, ofrendas are erected\
  \ to let the dead know they are not forgotten, and to celebrate their character\
  \ of whom they were when alive. Ofrendas are literally offerings to the deceased,\
  \ often with food or drink items, that they enjoyed when alive, set out for them.\
  \ These also include candles and a wealth of bright orange flowers called cempasutchitl\
  \ (or Mexican Marigolds) that signal to the departed and act as a bridge from their\
  \ world to this one. As such, whole areas of town and cemeteries become a bright\
  \ orange beacon of welcome in the lead up to DDM.\n\nIn the evening I am driven\
  \ to one of the largest cemeteries in the city to view the true nature of the holiday\
  \ firsthand. \nAs families gather by their fallen loved ones\u2019 gravesides, the\
  \ aforementioned ofrendas are arranged as the night becomes ablaze with colour,\
  \ sound and literal flame as people sing and perform to the dead, drink and talk\
  \ with them, and light candle upon candle so their souls may find their way back\
  \ to them.\nFar from being a sombre occasion, it feels more like Glastonbury than\
  \ any of the gothic outings it\u2019s often portrayed as on TV. Even then, I\u2019\
  m glad I took the time to learn some basic Spanish so that I might ask if it is\
  \ okay to take a photo of the twinkling tombs. People may be in high spirits but\
  \ you are still butting in on a family event (even if half of those family members\
  \ are dead thus aren\u2019t physically present to raise any objections).\nOn one\
  \ such request of a picture, an elderly lady begins to engage me in conversation\
  \ and persists even after my insistence that my Spanish is \u201Cmuy poquito\u201D\
  . Asking where I\u2019m from, she follows up with a \u201CIt is much different here,\
  \ yes?\u201D\nFor a beat or two (probably longer than that given my flailing language\
  \ skills) I consider this and I try to tell her (in not so many words) that we don\u2019\
  t have anything like this back home. In fact, that\u2019s one of the reasons I\u2019\
  m here, in this day and age of globalisation and homogeneous, holistic, capitalist\
  \ approaches to worship and wonder, it is not often you get to see something that\
  \ is truly different and unique to mostly one place.\n\xBFBonita, no? She says,\
  \ nodding to the tomb and its decorations she is overseeing.\n\u201CEs muy bonita,\u201D\
  \ I reply.\nShe hugs me and suddenly I am gone again, lost amongst the crowds. What\
  \ a strange and wonderful thing to happen, I think. What a strange and wonderful\
  \ thing."
