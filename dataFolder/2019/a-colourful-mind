Text: "Vibrant colours, sophisticated dresses and fancy hotels. That's what I've always\
  \ seen looking at the pictures of this city. A place visited by every blogger and\
  \ Instagrammer, chosen by the brands for photo shoots and even for weekend breaks.\
  \ That's why we didn't think twice when we were trying to choose where to go on\
  \ a February break. Tired of the British rainy weather we decided it was the perfect\
  \ time to visit this city as the chances of getting hot days were high. 31st of\
  \ December and it was done: 4 people, 5 days, Marrakesh. Booked to depart in less\
  \ than 2 months.\n\nInside the bag were carefully chosen outfits, each one inspired\
  \ by dozens of Instagram pictures I had saved on my phone. Inside me was an inexplicable\
  \ excitement as it was the first time I was going out of Europe. As soon as we reach\
  \ the airport, me and my friend starting taking pictures and admiring the incredible\
  \ structures around us. Outside, the guy holding the paper with the name of our\
  \ Riad was waiting for us and carried our bags. The posh feeling had started.\n\n\
  We were laughing and taking pictures when I looked through the window. My heart\
  \ almost stopped. On the streets, you only could see small motorbikes with 2 or\
  \ more people climbing in them, a lot of donkeys carrying mercenary, old men selling\
  \ fruits and vegetables and kids running around alone.\nI had arrived in a city\
  \ completely different than the one I was expecting, all the luxury I had seen in\
  \ pictures wasn't there, all the expensive brands haven't shown the truth.  But\
  \ the truth is... the city I found was far much better than the one I had seen online.\n\
  After a few days, I got used to the tight streets with the crazy traffic, to the\
  \ people trying to sell you everything they have for the price you want to pay,\
  \ to the kids who were using their little gowns and backpacks going to school every\
  \ morning and even to the sound of the mosques speakers at the time of their prayers.\
  \ \n\nI had the best 5 days of my life admiring a different culture, in a different\
  \ country surrounded by the most genuine people. \n\nBefore we went to the airport\
  \ on the last day, me and my friends decided to buy some biscuits for the flight.\
  \ The man who was selling them was so kind he let us try almost every sweet he had\
  \ to sell. As we were eating a small kid came behind my friend and with his little\
  \ fingers point to the sweet she had in her hand, and as soon as she handed it to\
  \ him a huge and bright smile open up lighting that small cute face. And in that\
  \ moment I knew it, Marrocco gained my heart but not because of the beautiful colours\
  \ or touristic places. It took my heart because it made me realize how important\
  \ are the smallest things in life and how, sometimes, we can have the richest lives\
  \ even inside the poorest houses."
