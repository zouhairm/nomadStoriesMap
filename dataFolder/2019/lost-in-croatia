Text: "On summer 2015 I arrived to the magical city of Barcelona to study a semester\
  \ abroad on my political science program. As I arrived, I was noticed I had three\
  \ more weeks of vacation since classes in Spain start mid september. I decidred\
  \ to spend my summer job savings and travel to eastern europe.\n\nMy first stop\
  \ was Duvbrovnik Croatia, I was so anxious to visit the city since I have always\
  \ been a big Game Of Thrones fan. It was my first time traveling alone, I arrived\
  \ at the airport and asked the lady at the tourist information place how to get\
  \ to my hostel, to be honest she was not gentle at all. Without talking she pointed\
  \ the bus stop and mentioned something I didnt catch. I entered the location of\
  \ my hostel on the google maps app on my phone hoping that would help me identify\
  \ the stop I had to take to get to my hostel. It was my first week In europe and\
  \ my phone was not working, I had no data and no reception. \n\nI boarded the bus\
  \ and 5 minutes after we left the airport my phone blacked out and I lost the location\
  \ of my hostel. I was feelinf nervous and asked the lady aitting next to me if she\
  \ knew where my hostel was, unfortunately she didnt speek english. Time passed until\
  \ there was only one man left besides me on the bus, In a blink of an eye the driver\
  \ stopped the bus and told us to leave the bus, I assumed it was the last stop.\
  \ \n\nI came down of the bus and noticed I was literally in the middle on nowhere.\
  \ I was in complete darkness, only the road and the bus stop. My phone was completley\
  \ blacked out and there was no one around to ask for help. I started feeling nervous\
  \ and scared, the road was emtpy and dark. As 10 minutes passed and no cars or busses\
  \ drived the road I decided to walk toward what I remembered being the city center.\
  \ I walked for 35 minutes in the dark and nothung happened until I decided to stop\
  \ and cry in the middle od the road. Suddenly a man in a Motorcycle stopped and\
  \ asked me something in croatian, I didnt understand but answered him in english\
  \ the name of my hostel crying fot help, he said something in croatian again telling\
  \ me  with hus hand to wait. After 30 minuted he came back in a van and he offered\
  \ me a raid to the hostel, he was thr most gentle stranger i have ever met. He left\
  \ me in my hostel, I told him I wanted to do something fot him in reward. The next\
  \ day he invited me to his home with his wife and children and we had the most amazing\
  \ croatian dinner, his wife spoke english so everything went excellent and we had\
  \ an amazing time. As I continued my time abroad we kept contact and last year,\
  \ Sermk my croatian ftiend came and visited my to Mexico City with his wife."
