Text: "The night was suddenly getting longer in Sarajevo.\n\nWe \u2013 six solo travelers\
  \ staying in the same hostel \u2013 had talked over spaghetti for an hour when one\
  \ of us eventually found out that we come from six different countries. Indonesia,\
  \ Turkey, Switzerland, Australia, England, Canada. It was beautiful, wasn\u2019\
  t it, to be surrounded by diversity? So, we felt the need to celebrate this improbable\
  \ encounter.\n\nFrom pasta to the beers. From hostel\u2019s kitchen to an Irish\
  \ pub.\n\nBeers were melting, mouths kept blabbering. I talked with Canadian guy\
  \ who was in his long-distance cycling trip from Portugal to China. He said he was\
  \ tired of living a normal city life in Montreal. So, he took a break from his job\
  \ as city bus driver and decided to be on the road. \u201CI might not go back to\
  \ Canada if I can find nice thing to do in China,\u201D he admitted. Still, before\
  \ it happens (or not), he just followed the road. It brought him to Sarajevo.\n\n\
  We also found commonality in football. He is an enthusiastic Montreal Impact fan,\
  \ while I am an ex-football journo who follows North American football a little\
  \ bit. He said \u2018football\u2019 not \u2018soccer\u2019. It was important thing.\
  \ We shared our football madness and experiences through stories occurred in many\
  \ places. He talked about the growing enthusiasm of MLS and one recent away trip\
  \ to Washington. I gave him a glance of Indonesian football: its passion, its riots,\
  \ its corrupt federation, its never-winning national team.\n\nWe talked and talked\
  \ and the beers were done. We \u2013 still six of us \u2013 moved to another drinking\
  \ pub, this one was more local and artisanal.\n\nThere I met an interesting middle-age\
  \ Bosnian guy who ran the pub. The place was full so we sat in his bar. There we\
  \ discussed Bosnian war, 1984 Winter Olympic, Bono, Sarajevo Film Festival, and\
  \ other things. He, we eventually found, participated in the 1984 Olympic as a bobsleigh\
  \ athlete. It was before the war shattered Sarajevo into pieces. It was before Bono\
  \ and U2 came to the city during the war and made the concert. It was before Sarajevo\
  \ Film Festival was started for the first time in the time of war.\n\nI was mesmerized\
  \ by the fact that the Bosnian guy had just told us his first-hand experiences of\
  \ Bosnian war. Yet, he seemed okay. He smiled while telling his stories. His voice\
  \ wasn\u2019t trembling at all. Then, at some point, I encouraged myself to ask\
  \ him his feeling about war and whether he keeps hatred toward people who killed\
  \ his friends and relatives. I will not forget his words forever. He said: \u201C\
  The war is over and we have to keep going, to live. We can only do so if we forgive.\
  \ I forgive the war.\u201D\n\nHow can people forgive the war? How can people keep\
  \ living in the war-torn place like Sarajevo? My head was spinning by the questions\
  \ I made.\n\nWe slowly changed topic, from the war to Portugal-China cycling trip.\
  \ Alike me, the Bosnian was impressed by the Canadian guy\u2019s plan. Actually,\
  \ the latter had little doubt if he would be able to finish it. The Bosnian assured\
  \ him that everything is going to be okay. \u201CWhat you do, cycling to China,\
  \ is normal. Back in the days, the war was also normal for us. That was why we survive.\
  \ That was why we had U2 concert and created film festival, both happened during\
  \ the war. It is a normal life. We just keep going,\u201D the Bosnian added.\n\n\
  My head, once again, was spinning. This time by the Bosnian guy\u2019s words. Is\
  \ cycling from Portugal to China normal? Is the war normal? I don\u2019t know. However,\
  \ there was something makes sense in his words. I wasn\u2019t sure what it was.\n\
  \nWe came back to the hostel around 3 am. When I jumped to my bed, azan from minaret\
  \ filled the Sarajevo\u2019s air. I suddenly missed home."
