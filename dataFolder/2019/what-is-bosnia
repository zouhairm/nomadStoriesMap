Text: "I'd just decided to record the video on the phone via a selfie stick, and then\
  \ it began...\nThis was the first trip abroad in my life: I had to live in D\xFC\
  sseldorf for a month and study German. After a night's sleep after a night airplane,\
  \ I looked at the calendar: before the start of the course, I had the whole weekend,\
  \ and I decided to use it wisely. Booking the driver in Blablacar, a small backpack\
  \ on my back and a thirst for adventure. Frankfurt, wait for me!\nHe loved me. Frankfurt\
  \ loved me and gave me warmth, sunshine and nice people. There were a lot of police\
  \ near the station and there were young people standing by the wall. Drug traffickers?\
  \ On one side of the river stood huge cottages, a pool and a tennis court could\
  \ be seen through the crack of the fence, and on the other side of the river people\
  \ slept right on the asphalt, covered with a thin and dirty bedspread. \u201CCity\
  \ for all\u201D - said the inscription under the bridge in German. Valid for all.\
  \ It is not only in my country that there is such a contrast between rich and poor.\
  \ On the waterfront, people had a picnic, one company played ping-pong. What an\
  \ atmosphere! I wanted to remember this moment ... I had just started recording\
  \ a video, and suddenly ... \nThose ping-pong guys came running and started screaming\
  \ something fun.\n\"Sorry, I speak German badly.\"\n\"Where are you from?\"\n\"\
  Russia\"\nFor some reason they were terribly happy to hear this word. One of them\
  \ was from Bulgaria and looked like a little gypsy. Two were from Bosnia. A Bosnian\
  \ with the strange name \u201CEvo\u201D for some reason immediately asked me when\
  \ I had a birthday. When it turned out that we were born in one week, he jumped\
  \ for joy like crazy. \nBosnia and Herzegovina? Before I had only heard about this\
  \ country in school at geography lessons. When we studied the countries of Europe,\
  \ it was this name that I liked the most. I imagined that quiet and calm Europeans\
  \ live there in small houses. And in front of me was a noisy and slightly crazy\
  \ guy. What is this country?\nEvo knew English, he constantly asked me how would\
  \ any word be in Russian. When I answered, he washappy as a child and called the\
  \ Bosnian word. You have a \"yazyk\", we have a \"yezik\" - he laughed. What similar\
  \ words! Really.\nAfter affectionate attempts to teach me to play ping-pong, Evo\
  \ finally realized that it was useless. Evo. Who is he? He was just as crazy as\
  \ I am, spoke a similar language, but he lived in Europe\u2026 And I still thought,\
  \ what kind of country is Bosnia? \nThe next day I was at the station 1.5 hours\
  \ before the bus. For parting with the city, I went to the very embankment where\
  \ I met those amazing guys. Of course, they were not there ... But suddenly someone\
  \ called out to me.\n\n\"Lida\" - He smiled happily and was so glad to see me. He\
  \ called me to go with him for some business. While we chatted, he met some guy.\
  \ I already saw him! He was standing by the wall surrounded by policemen at the\
  \ 1st day. I looked at my watch: god! 15 minutes to the bus, but I still needed\
  \ to pick up the phone from the kiosk!!! We ran to the kiosk with all our feet,\
  \ light rain cooled us on the road, and I scolded him. Scolded by the roughest expressions\
  \ that I\u2019m going to miss the bus because of him, that I hate him a lot. In\
  \ a fit of rage, I switched to my Russian language. He didn't know Russian, but\
  \ I think that he understood everything. For some reason, from my swearing, he smiled\
  \ even more.\nWe ran on time. He gave me some food and again called his wife.\n\
  Just in the bus, I opened Google and wrote.\nBosnia and Herzegovina."
