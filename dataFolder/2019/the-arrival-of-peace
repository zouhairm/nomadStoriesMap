Text: "White, totally white was the only thing that could be seen through the window\
  \ of the waiting room at the airport, it was already 6 in the morning and little\
  \ by little it began to dissipate the thick fog, that fog that had delayed my flight.\
  \ While I was thinking about the long day ahead, my thoughts were interrupted by\
  \ the announcement to board the plane. Forty-five minutes later I land in Medellin,\
  \ best known as \"The city of eternal spring\" of Colombia. \n\nOnce I claim the\
  \ luggage, I take the bus number five, which would take me to the municipality of\
  \ Puerto Valdivia, where I would meet some peasant leaders. It would be four hours\
  \ of travel on the mountainous road surrounded by coffee plantations. The trip took\
  \ more time than I thought, I barely had time to leave the suitcase at the hotel,\
  \ eat something and go to the kiosk, the place where they were waiting for me.\n\
  \nFinally, at noon, in the middle of a long walk and with the  only company of the\
  \ hot air in my skin, I saw in the distance the old straw kiosk. Five peasant leaders\
  \ were waiting for me, all with many stories to tell. But he was the person who\
  \ most impacted me, not only because he was the first one I interviewed in my work\
  \ to document the Colombian post-conflict, also because he would mark this crossing.\
  \ \n\nI remember him very well, he was tall with short black hair, brown eyes, a\
  \ prominent nose and his hands were worn from working the earth so hard. His name\
  \ was Jose, or as his friends called him: Chepe. As we left the kiosk and walked\
  \ along the unpaved road to the pink house of \"Tita\" the wisest woman in town,\
  \ Chepe told me about his activities as a peasant leader in one of the townships\
  \ and how the of how the community's hope for a new beginning resurfaced after the\
  \ signing of the peace agreement between the government of Colombia and the FARC.\
  \ \n\nTita\u2019s house was big and full of pillows used by the young people who\
  \ came every week to listen her stories.  We chatted a bit about everything, the\
  \ economic situation of the country, the future of the government, the peace process,\
  \ we even talked about cinema, culture, and off course the nobel prize Gabriel Garcia\
  \ Marquez. \n\nOne by one the leaders told me their life stories, \"Chepe\" was\
  \ the first. At the beginning he looked restless, his nerves were all on edge, but\
  \ little by little he calmed down and  spoke with confidence in front the camera.\
  \ He told me the decision he made since the end of the war: to stop cultivating\
  \ cocaine, to convince its neighbors that they would pass to the legality and so\
  \ they could access the benefits granted by the government for the titling of their\
  \ lands. His eyes clouded when he told me about his father's abduction and the serious\
  \ illness his wife suffered, but with a stronger tone he declared that this situation\
  \ is his daily motive to get up and work the land day by day. Throughout the afternoon,\
  \ the leaders told me their fears, their dreams, their failures and their projects.\
  \ The meeting ended with a typical \u201Cbandeja paisa\u201D prepared by \"Tita\"\
  , a dish that includes beans, fried rice, meat, chorizo, fried egg, ripe banana,\
  \ avocado and korn cake very famous meal of the region.\n\nWhen I said goodbye to\
  \ the community, I thought that the story was over there, for me it was only necessary\
  \ to edit and publish it, it took me two weeks to edit the material, the day I finished\
  \ it, when I was about to present the positive face of the peace agreement, came\
  \ the bad news: Chepe had been killed, some said that because of his work as a leader,\
  \ nobody knows who killed him but the only certain thing is that he became one of\
  \ the many leaders that \u201Cpeace\u201D has silenced."
