Text: "Sun field.\n\nThis is the way that my Italian boyfriend pronounces my favourite\
  \ show Seinfeld. I\u2019ll be honest, I didn\u2019t correct it at first. I love\
  \ the way he can take something so common and make it endearing without even knowing\
  \ it.\nWhen we first met in 2014, it was one of those stories you hear about that\
  \ only seems to happen in Italy. I was doing my Eat, Pray, Love thing and Dami,\
  \ well, he was doing these activities too! Except he was doing them on a moment\
  \ to moment basis as they are at the crux of his Italian culture. \n\nMy eager Scottish\
  \ travel friend and I were up for a night on the town in Rimini and whisky cocktails\
  \ seemed (by her accord) the only way forward. Challenge accepted.\n\nWe got a 6\
  \ euro bottle of \u2018Old Country\u2019 whiskey from the local shop and pretended\
  \ not to notice each other wincing with each sip. \n\nIt was May and warm enough\
  \ to rock a tank top and flip flops, my unofficial travel uniform which gave me\
  \ away as a foreigner from across the room Dami would later share.\n\nTo say that\
  \ Italians don\u2019t take the nightclub scene lightly, would be an understatement.\
  \ For a moment we forgot that we weren\u2019t on the runway of Milan but rather\
  \ a moderately sized beachside club called Coconuts. \n\nIf I\u2019m honest, at\
  \ the start of my 5-month trip I never thought I would end up with an Italian Stallion.\
  \ I had impressive illusions of being swept up and carried through the Highlands,\
  \ Gerard Butler style- kilt and all! I digress...\n\nIn saying that, meeting someone\
  \ who doesn\u2019t speak your language but understands you on a deeper level is\
  \ the aphrodisiacs of all aphrodisiacs.\n\nIt was on a midnight beach walk when\
  \ I realized that Dami could not only understand me but was patiently listening\
  \ without any expectations. I made the first move (clumsily) as I fell into the\
  \ sand and pulled him on top of me for our first kiss. As you would expect, he was\
  \ making exclamations in Italian that (at the time) I could not understand but appreciated\
  \ just the same.\n\nWaking up in the home of a truly Catholic family is never complete\
  \ without your new beau\u2019s Italian mama awkwardly waving to you from the window\
  \ in her apron donning a facial expression that could only be described as pure\
  \ bewilderment.\n\nAdmittedly, it wasn\u2019t a great first impression.\n\nOur first\
  \ date was spent on the seaside of his town followed by a road trip to an entirely\
  \ new country. It was in San Marino where I made a wish in the fountain that Dami\
  \ liked me as much as I liked him. When I look at a photo of this moment I see only\
  \ love.\n\nDami dropped me off at the hostel and posed against his car in an attempt\
  \ at \u2018cool guy fashion\u2019 with his elbow grazing the hood and sliding right\
  \ off in a perfectly apropos nerdy fashion. Swoon.\n\nWe spent 3 weeks following\
  \ each other around Italy squeezing in visits wherever we could: Rimini, Fano, La\
  \ Spezia, Perugia, and back to Fano. \n\nWhen it came time to continue my journey\
  \ via a 13-hour ferry ride to Greece, Dami picked red and white roses from his father\u2019\
  s garden \u201Cfor Canada\u201D and I left him with a photo of us with the places\
  \ we had already been together listed on the back with \u201C....Toronto?\u201D\
  \ strategically left at the very bottom. \n\nWe were mostly silent on the drive\
  \ to the ferry docks and when it came time to part, I wanted to stay. Our separation\
  \ was visibly emotional which was made evident to us as an older Italian man screamed\
  \ l'amore \xE8 bello from the window of his car boarded the ferry."
