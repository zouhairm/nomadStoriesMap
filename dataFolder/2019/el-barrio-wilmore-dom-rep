Text: "The island of Hispaniola is an abusive marriage between two countries: the\
  \ Dominican Republic and Haiti. There is widespread Anti-Haitianism, which is a\
  \ Dominican implementation of anti-blackness. It plagues the entire island and divides\
  \ us like cracked egg, hidden behind a shell, and fried by the Caribbean sun. It\
  \ is a \u201Cmona fea\u201D (ugly monkey) or \u201Cque te pasa con tu cabeza\u201D\
  \ (what\u2019s wrong with your hair?). This means that our grandfathers remember\
  \ our bodies back to a genocide of Haitians if your skin was too black or if you\
  \ couldn\u2019t whip your tongue in order to pronounce \u201Cperejil\u201D (parsley\
  \ in Spanish).\nIt was 2016. I went on my first trip to the Dominican Republic with\
  \ my mother, an Afro-Dominicana from Santiago De Los Caballeros, also known as \u201C\
  El Cuidad Corazon.\u201D It was the most exciting trip and my first outside of the\
  \ United States. As an ethnically mixed black woman, deriving from an African American\
  \ father and an Afro-Dominican mother. I have always known what it is like to exist\
  \ in two places at once; for my soul to exist in both the peach cobbler and the\
  \ platano (plantains); for my ears to exist in the mumble rap and the merengue.\
  \ I am very passionate about remedying anti-blackness within my mother\u2019s culture\
  \ because of the trauma I\u2019ve endured and my mother and my mother\u2019s mother\
  \ who\u2019ve been taught to hate their skin and their hair or anything affiliated\
  \ with black. I wanted to bring awareness to myself and others, and visibility.\
  \ Thus, I began research.\nI began to research everything I could about black Dominicans\
  \ on the Island prior to our visit. I learned the most fascinating news about African\
  \ Americans who fled American racism in the 19th century. They were called the Saman\xE1\
  \ Americans. They preserved English and African American hymns and traditions from\
  \ the 1800s. I was emotional and excited to see two of my cultures merge that usually\
  \ do not. There was one particular family and community that has been widely researched\
  \ and popularly used as a case study in the Institute for Latino Studies and AfroCubaWeb:\
  \ The Wilmore Family and the neighborhood, El Barrio Wilmore.\nSo, mi mother and\
  \ I flew, landed, and explored. Being in my mother\u2019s city, I have never seen\
  \ the Spanish language have so much swagger. Their tongues dressed up fly with thick\
  \ accent, hot like a fur coat in the summertime. We took a five hour bus across\
  \ the country to reach Bahia Principe, a resort located in the Saman\xE1 Province.\
  \ It was a beautiful scenery: motorcycles flew in every barrio and every pueblo,\
  \ green palm trees everywhere, farms and cattle and horses, colorful houses, and\
  \ tall, green mountains. My mother had been speaking to this one brother that looked\
  \ like he was from Philly, but he was a local. Everything was dandy, until we were\
  \ stranded with our suitcases in a neighborhood my mother had never known. She was\
  \ terrified. The man from Philly but really a local told us that we could wait at\
  \ his grandmother\u2019s house. He would go find us a taxi, he said. \n\n\u201C\
  Hello, what is your name? And where exactly are we?\u201D my mother asks.\n\u201C\
  My name is Martha Wilmore and you are in El Barrio Wilmore.\u201D"
