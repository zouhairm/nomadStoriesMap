Text: "Thirty miles north of the fairy tale esque city of Prague lies the remnants\
  \ of a World War II concentration camp and Jewish ghetto. Although not an extermination\
  \ camp, the grounds of Terez\xEDn acted as a physical purgatory for its inmates,\
  \ where both outcomes result in a flaming inferno \u2013 either falling victim to\
  \ the Terez\xEDn\u2019s overcrowding, disease, and malnutrition or waiting anywhere\
  \ from a few months to years before arriving at Treblinka or Auschwitz where final\
  \ solution awaits them.\n\nTo experience this piece of history, I boarded a bus\
  \ at Prague\u2019s Hole\u0161ovice train station unsure of what would be waiting\
  \ for me when my feet once again would touch the ground. Unlike the capital city\
  \ of Prague, there were no intricately designed cobblestone streets welcoming me\
  \ when I stepped off of the bus. The vibrant, tourist hub with a myriad of architectural\
  \ styles I was vacationing in an hour earlier was replaced by mass graves and militaristic,\
  \ architectural order \u2013 only standing to serve a function, lacking any form\
  \ of beauty to be appreciated by visitors.\n\nUpon entrance to Terez\xEDn Memorial\
  \ I asked the ticket seller when the next guided tour in English would begin. She\
  \ stated the next tour of the small fortress, ghetto museum, and barracks would\
  \ begin in 15 minutes, however, my ears suddenly picked up the faint sound in the\
  \ distance of an English speaker telling the story of how Gavrilo Princip, the man\
  \ responsible for assassinating Franz Ferdinand, Archduke of Austria and his wife,\
  \ died in the fortress, which was also used as a political prison camp during World\
  \ War I. I suddenly found myself both captivated by stories centered around Nazi\
  \ produced propaganda and the German phrase \u201CArbeit macht frei,\u201D which\
  \ means \u201CWork sets you free.\u201D \n\nI stood there, captivated and horrified\
  \ at the same time, feeling so close, yet so far to the 33,000 lives that were lost\
  \ right where I was. Wrapped up in these stories of inhumane treatment and abuse,\
  \ I failed to realize my eagerness to get a head start on touring the grounds led\
  \ me into a private tour group \u2013 not one that was a part of the Terez\xEDn\
  \ Memorial, but one composed of Americans touring Central Europe solely to visit\
  \ all major concentration camps and learn more about one of the darkest times in\
  \ world history. After laughing with a few fellow Americans about wandering aimlessly\
  \ into their tour group that they\u2019ve been traveling with for weeks, I learned\
  \ that the Terez\xEDn Memorial was one of the camps that evicted less emotion for\
  \ them, due to its nature of being known as more of a transport camp. I ignorantly\
  \ thought to myself, who would willingly pay for a trip to Europe just to self-inflict\
  \ feelings of grief and sadness? \n\nOnce the tour came to a close, the tour guide\
  \ approached my travel companion and myself and jokingly said \u201CThere\u2019\
  s room on the bus if you want to join us on the rest of our journey.\u201D We politely\
  \ laughed and said we would have to decline, but maybe in the future. We parted\
  \ ways with our new, unexpected friends \u2013 with them hours ahead to their next\
  \ location on a path of educational discovery, and us on a bus back to Prague, looking\
  \ forward to a thoughtless night of drinking absinthe and enjoying goulash with\
  \ pretty strangers."
