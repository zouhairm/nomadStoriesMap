Text: "I have never been to Heaven. But I think, the most similar to being there,\
  \ is undoubtedly to visit Luang Prabang, and see , for example the sunset from Mount\
  \ Poussi. After climbing 328 steps, the reward is being able to touch the clouds\
  \ and even, dream, of nearly being part of them.\nLuang Prabang is a hidden treasure\
  \ between two rivers, the Mekong and the Nam Khan. Both take care and protect this\
  \ town known as the jewel of Laos. The Mekong is kind of magical and hypnotizing.\
  \ A local recommended me throwing a stone in the Mekong and observing until how\
  \ far it got. I did not have time to do this. Because, despite its small size, Luang\
  \ Prabang has a special energy which mesmerizes us and makes time lose its linear\
  \ dimensity.\nThanks to this local, I could find about Big Brother Mouse, a small\
  \ association that organizes book parties in rural areas in the country. And all\
  \ of us are invited to attend them and just speak a bit of English with the kids\
  \ around there. It is worthy helping them and you see so many smiles, that ones\
  \ even ends up competing to see who says thank you more times! \nAlso, the monks\
  \ in the Vat Nong temple are more than willing to exchange experiences and their\
  \ knowledge with the tourists. Talking to them is much better than reading any book\
  \ about Laos or the Buddhist culture. Many monks are still kids. We cannot forget\
  \ Laos is a very poor country and being monk is a way of being educated and learn\
  \ English. A  language that most of them want to practice because tourism is the\
  \ main economic activity.\nAt any time of the day, Luang Pragang gets full with\
  \ the orange colour of their robes and umbrellas to protect themselves from the\
  \ sun. The heat  even though being quite intense, it is a bit less than in its neighbouring\
  \ countries. Maybe, the sunbeams are more laid-back and peaceful here. Laotians\
  \ are well known in all South-East Asia for their laid-back attitude. And you can\
  \ feel it. You walk in the small streets and locals look at you and smile saying\
  \ Sabaidee (hello).\nI left Luang Prabang out of tears. Because I didn\u2019t have\
  \ time to throw the stone in the Mekong and see how far it could get. And out of\
  \ happiness, because I had found out about this heaven on Earth, called Luang Prabang."
