Text: "My first day in South Africa, I hot a warm reception from my old friends whom\
  \ had contacted before leaving  Nigeria for South Africa, right in my hotel room,\
  \ I was hearing a popular Nigerian song from a nearby club right in my hotel room\
  \ along Rostenville in Johannesburg. I still felt the vibe of my dear country Nigeria\
  \ around me. \n  Then a day passed, I had to leave Johannesburg for Bloemfontein\
  \ in Free State province of South Africa, that's when it got dawned on me that I'm\
  \ out of Nigeria, there I started feeling the strong love they have for us ( Nigerians)\
  \  especially the men, I began to see the advancement from South African girls who\
  \ were really in love with the Nigerian guys especially the newly come ones.\n \
  \ I started showcasing all the attributes I possess as a Nigerian guy which made\
  \ the love stronger, I started work few months after, I was posted outside of town\
  \ to a nearby town called Phillipolis, on getting there I was loved by all and sundry\
  \  not until we traveled from there to the country's capital, Pretoria. \n  I took\
  \ a taxi that same night to a club and I saw the other side of South African men,\
  \ the man told he had no change after I gave him a Hundred Rands, meanwhile I was\
  \ supposed to pay him Seventy Rands.  There the taxi driver told me, \" This is\
  \ why I hate Africans\" I asked him if he wasn't an African, he said to me, South\
  \ Africa is not  Africa and South Africans don't behave like other Africans. Therefore,\
  \ we other Africans are the ones who reason and act like animals.  I felt so furious\
  \ but it was late at night and they have told us stories about them, how they go\
  \ about with knives and how cruel they can be when they are angry.\n   That made\
  \ me think why do we have so much love by the women outside Nigeria and get this\
  \ mighty hatred from men out there ."
