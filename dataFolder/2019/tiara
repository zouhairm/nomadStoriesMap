Text: "That day started really bad for me.  First, my bike wasn't working so I had\
  \ to travel 25km in a very crowded bus with grumpy passengers. Second, when I finally\
  \ reached Sinhagad road, my friend, Manasi, was going to be at least an hour late,so\
  \ now I had to wait for her in an unknown area.  \nFrustrated, I started searching\
  \ for a nearby cafe. But instead of a cafe I found the famous Deshpande Garden.\
  \ One of the most famous gardens for film shooting and favorite spot for couples\
  \ to hangout. I really wanted to checkout all the places where some of my favorite\
  \ scenes were shooted, so I went in. \nGarden was really huge and very beautiful.\
  \ I felt like all my frustration and anger is evaporating just by being there. It\
  \ was calm and soothing. All the birds chirping and squirrels roaming in the garden,\
  \ it was amazing. I saw a shed mostly used as bus stops in movies and an artificial\
  \ water fall. All the scenes from movies which were shooted here were flashing in\
  \ front of my eyes. I was lost in my thoughts when I realised I was at the back\
  \ gate of the garden, my phone was ringing, it was Manasi, she needed another half\
  \ an hour. But this time I didn't mind. \nThere was a line of trees in the garden,\
  \  below which there were many white flowers,  like a snow covered land. A small\
  \ girl, about 5 years old, was wearing a tiara made up of those flowers. She was\
  \ collecting more of them and was giving it to a lady sitting nearby, in her fifties\
  \ maybe, who was making those beautiful tiara's. I was just looking at those flowers\
  \ in her hand and how she was transforming them into pretty tiara's. She had a very\
  \ bright smile. She caught me staring at her and asked me to sit besides her. I\
  \ was astounded. Being an introvert I didn't talk much but she started talking as\
  \ if we were childhood friends, though she was stuttering sometimes. She started\
  \ telling me everything about the garden and nearby places. Like she was unaware\
  \ about her stuttering. She spoke with such confidence, and the  calmness on her\
  \ face made her more beautiful than the tiara. \nHer grandmother taught her how\
  \ to make it. She told me when she was a little girl everyone made fun of her and\
  \ no one played with her. She was alone and sad, but then her grandmother used to\
  \ give her this hand made tiara and tell her, 'You are a queen. Strong, wise, confident\
  \ and most importantly invisible. You won't be defeated just because they say so.\
  \ So keep trying until you win'. That's how she became a social activist. \nSo now\
  \ whenever she or anyone else feels low, she makes a tiara for them and tell them\
  \ what her grandma always told her. This was her way of remembering her grandma,\
  \  to keep her grandma and her thoughts alive. \nI never met her again. I don't\
  \ even know her name.  But she gave me confidence to follow my dreams and not let\
  \ others hinder my path. I met a Hero that day."
