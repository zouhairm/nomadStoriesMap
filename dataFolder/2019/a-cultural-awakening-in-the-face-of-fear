Text: "After 26 hours commuting, four months planning and two years waiting, I arrived.\
  \ But arriving was the easy part; convincing my parents to let me go was a different\
  \ story. \n\nParis, Vegas and Sutherland Springs \u2013 remnants of lives filled\
  \ our TV screens and Twitter feeds, all with one stark realization in common: it\
  \ could happen to anyone. But it would never happen to me. So, despite my parents\u2019\
  \ opposition, I booked my flight. \u201CIt\u2019s safe,\u201D I told them. \u201C\
  Everyone\u2019s going.\u201D\n\nI arrived in Bangkok on the brink of Songkran, Thailand\u2019\
  s New Year and largest festival. \u201CWelcome to the Land of Smiles,\u201D the\
  \ local flight attendant offered as I stepped off the plane into the jetway. \u201C\
  Graci\u2026aaaas,\u201D I spit out in the same breath I realized my mind had reverted\
  \ to the only foreign language I know. She chuckled, \u201CIn Thailand, \u2018korb\
  \ khun ka\u2019 is how we say \u2018thank you.\u2019\u201D\n\nI practically sprinted\
  \ through immigration reuniting with my best friend, Oranisa, for the first time\
  \ since leaving New York. It was my turn to experience her culture and learn about\
  \ her home country. The week flew by with temple-hopping, tuk tuk-riding and an\
  \ abundance of spicy Thai food, but my true Thai experience lie waiting on day seven.\
  \ On the morning of Songkran, we filled up our water guns, put on our 200 baht ($6)\
  \ tropical shirts and headed for the streets. A gush of water immediately pelted\
  \ my face; I was in for an awakening.\n\nAfter a day\u2019s worth of water gun wars,\
  \ we walked down Khao San Road headed for our hotel. But the shoulder-to-shoulder\
  \ crowds suddenly shifted in direction as the hundreds of people before us began\
  \ running away from whatever lie ahead. I panicked, grabbed Oranisa\u2019s hand\
  \ and ducked into the alcove of an ATM machine, crammed among four others. We hid\
  \ as people ran frantically, screaming and trampling over one another. I glanced\
  \ at Oranisa, desperate for an explanation, but the fear in her eyes gave away what\
  \ we both were thinking. I prepared myself for gunshots, bombs or demanding voices\
  \ \u2014 anything signifying a terrorist attack. \u201CWell, there\u2019s someone\
  \ in front of us,\u201D I thought. \u201CAt least we\u2019re not first. Were mom\
  \ and dad right? Should I call them and say goodbye? There\u2019s no way this is\
  \ happening. Is this it?\u201D \n\nBut the screaming died down, the dust settled,\
  \ and people slowly emerged from whatever nook and cranny they\u2019d used as shelter.\
  \ The scene mirrored a horror movie. Children cried as their parents apprehensively\
  \ shielded them. Stray flip flops lay sporadically throughout the street. Fences\
  \ were knocked over, and tables were flipped upside down. A local shop owner informed\
  \ Oranisa there had been a fight. \u201CThey ran away from a fight!?\u201D I stammered\
  \ in frustration. Yes \u2013 there had been a fight between rowdy, inebriated teenagers,\
  \ and a few punches were thrown. There had simply been a fight, and yet my life\
  \ flashed before my eyes. I was furious. \n\nBut then it hit me \u2014 most Americans\
  \ would\u2019ve run toward the fight; the Thai people ran away. Most Americans would\u2019\
  ve cheered on the violence; the Thai people shunned it. I was no longer angry. Instead,\
  \ I found myself wishing Americans, and the world in general, were more like the\
  \ Thai people \u2014 peaceful, kind and constantly smiling. In that moment, everything\
  \ I hope for (the peace so many people hope for) felt deeply rooted and connected\
  \ to the culture of the Thai people.\n\nWe returned to our hotel on that steamy\
  \ pre-monsoon season evening, and my adrenaline died down as I packed my suitcase.\
  \ I headed for the airport the following morning contemplating all I\u2019d experienced\
  \ the night before. But as I crossed the jetway stepping into the comfort of my\
  \ home-bound plane, I realized what my frightening recollection was ironically causing\
  \ \u2014 my smile.\n\nI took my seat in 15A overlooking the front edge of the wing,\
  \ and as the plane steadily rose to 30,000 feet and I watched Bangkok disappear\
  \ below me, I softly whispered, \u201Ckorb khun ka, Thailand.\u201D"
