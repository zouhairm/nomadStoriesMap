Text: "Two years ago my college was orginizing a volunteer trip to Kolkata, India.\
  \ I have always wanted to go to India, but the idea of going as a volunteer was\
  \ kind of scary to me, because I had never done it before.\nSomething inside me\
  \ told me I should go, so I decided to sign up. I went with the idea of helping\
  \ whoever needs it. \nWhat I never expected was to find out the greatest lesson\
  \ in my life, until today.\n\n     The trip started traveling for 1 week. On those\
  \ days we went to Delhi, Agra, the iconic city where the Taj Mahal is located, and\
  \ Jaipur where we took a ride on elephants. I was impresed by the story behind every\
  \ place, the gardens, the architecture, the colors, the music, the culture, the\
  \ diversity of religions, everything. Every site we vistited was breathtaking because\
  \ of it's beauty and magic.\n\nI have always liked and agreed with some Buddhist\
  \ thoughts, so I was really happy and lucky to be there, that was one of the reasons\
  \ I have always wanted to go to India. \nMy idea of going to India was to learn\
  \ from the Buddhist, go to a retirement, enjoy what Indian culture has to give and\
  \ enjoy the tourist trip.  But the reality was completely different.\n\nAfter traveling\
  \ on those 3 cities we arrived to Kolkata. The first thing we did was going to mass,\
  \ I am Catholic but not practicing, and there at mass, I felt a terrible desire\
  \ to cry and did not know why. \nAfter mass we went to a sharing where all the volunteers\
  \ expressed what they have experiencied or lived in that week. And suddenly, I started\
  \ to cry, without knowing why and without being close to anyone. That had never\
  \ happened to me before. \nThe second day we went to a house of the eldery of Mother\
  \ Teresa's Missonaries of Charity, I did not know how to act or what to do, because\
  \ all the older adults were so grateful that we were there to help them or for the\
  \ simple fact of caring for them. I had never in my life felt that way. I was astonished\
  \ with the moment and with myself because I did not know what to do about it.\n\n\
  On the way back, I talked to a priest and told him what I felt and about my crying,\
  \ his answer was \"you are feeling the peace and tranquility that God is giving\
  \ you\". I kept quiet and thoughtful.\nTo the trip I took book about life and soul\
  \ from an Indian autor, and that same night I read a paragraph that wrote love is\
  \ when you feel that special peace and tranquility that the moment or the person\
  \ gives to you. I was astonished, that made some sense to me.\n\nIn the following\
  \ days I went to volunteer to a children\xB4s house, where I helped to do the laundry,\
  \ praying, painting, feeding, support on therapies, playing and whatever was needed.\
  \ But inside me something was different, I felt kind of different. \nWe walked through\
  \ India\xB4s streets and we were able to see the real world; we saw poverty, humility,\
  \ despair, fear, sadness, hunger, lack of desire, and so on many emotions that lose\
  \ sight of the real meaning of life. But also we saw and felt hope, love, kindness,\
  \ innocence, pureness, \ngreatness, tenderness, and all those feelings that are\
  \ in the same path as the real sense of life. \n\n     Watching this contrast about\
  \ people fighting to survive, people giving up in all of they have and peolpe being\
  \ happy with whatever they have or are, despite its condition, its family situation\
  \ or circumstance, was something that woke me up. \nOne of the last days I was meditating\
  \ and felt something. The words of the priest and the book made sense to me, I understood.\
  \ Watching, thinking, hearing but specially living the real life, in the present\
  \ moment, it told me something. \nLove.\nLove was what I felt, love was what I had\
  \ never experienced in my life before.\nI woke up.\nSelf-love, pure love, real love.\
  \ \nThat, is what India tought me, how to love."
