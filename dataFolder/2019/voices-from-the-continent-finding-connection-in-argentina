Text: "Last year, as I was travelling through Argentina, a local acquaintance told\
  \ me about this event called the \u201CInti Raymi\u201D, a ritual performed by many\
  \ of the indigenous people in South-America to celebrate the winter solstice. At\
  \ the time, I had been living in the city of C\xF3rdoba for a couple of weeks, thanks\
  \ to an invitation by a friend of mine back in Mexico to stay with at his mother\xB4\
  s house during the summer. I had honestly never thought to visit that country before,\
  \ but the invitation, coupled with an incredibly cheap flight I was able to find,\
  \ made it an opportunity that I felt couldn\u2019t be passed on. So it was that\
  \ I ended up in the \u201CIsla de los Patos\u201D on June the 22th: the day I met\
  \ Diana.  \nWalking through the park, waiting for the ceremony to begin, I looked\
  \ for someone who could walk me through what was happening. It was then that I saw\
  \ a short, dark-haired girl with a camera, taking pictures of the people attending.\
  \ I came up to her and asked her what she knew about the ceremony. Though her accent\
  \ immediately struck me to be as foreign as mine, she was kind enough to tell me\
  \ the essentials of what was going on. It turned out she was a student who had been\
  \ sent there for her class on documentary photography. She asked me where I was\
  \ from and how was I getting along in the city. All and all, she found my story\
  \ quite compelling, and asked me to go get coffee with her some time. \nWe went\
  \ out a couple of days later, and it was then I learned that she had come from Peru\
  \ to study cinematography. After that, I told her I was a writer, which turned out\
  \ she was too. The next couple of hours we spent discussing our ideas about art,\
  \ as we walked through the city and she showed me around the local artistic scene.\
  \ It turned out Diana was quite the polymath. Tremendously well-read, she spoke\
  \ four languages, played the mandolin, painted, and used her spare time to edit\
  \ short films, which she wrote, shot, and directed. She was one of those people\
  \ used to talking little, not for lack of anything to say, but because she found\
  \ she genuinely found more pleasure in listening to what others had to say. The\
  \ kind of woman that always could surprise you with her sensibility and creativity,\
  \ but who had learned throughout her life to show that side of her only selectively.\
  \ \nThe second time we went out, it was to this underground bar where most of the\
  \ clientele of comprised of foreigners from the continent which immigrated to Argentina\
  \ for its free college education. There we spent all night talking. She told me\
  \ about what life was like in the city of Lima, where she was born. We also spoke\
  \ about the problems in our countries and how we both felt that art could be a way\
  \ to help heal some of the scars of our fragmented nations, and hopefully make way\
  \ for a better future. As I walked her home, I told her she was like a walking poem.\
  \ She blushed and hugged me. Later on, I tried to kiss her. She declined but responded\
  \ by kissing me on the cheek. \nThe third and last time we met, it was on a small\
  \ coffee shop where a folk singer was playing these old-time Latin American protest\
  \ songs. All of the sudden, she pulled out a voice-recorder and placed it on the\
  \ table saying that she enjoyed our talks so much that she wanted to record them\
  \ in case she later needed some inspiration. After the coffee, we went for a long\
  \ walk through the city. It was then she said, almost like a confession, that she\
  \ had felt inspired by something we\xB4d mentioned at the bar the other night, and\
  \ she wanted to produce a film about it. It was right then that we sat down on a\
  \ bench and, together, wrote down the outline for a film we are working on even\
  \ now. Half a year, and half a world later."
