Text: "My body is not built for this. I have shoulders that are too wide and pointy.\
  \ My left shoulder is currently wedged beneath the underarm of the man beside me.\
  \ His arm is up against the seat in front of him. I wish he would put it down because\
  \ all I can feel is the wet patch on my shoulder from his sweat slowly getting bigger.\
  \ He probably can\u2019t move his arm back because there isn\u2019t enough room\
  \ for three grown adults to lean against the back of the seat. \n\nThere are people\
  \ much worse off than me, some have been standing for the last three hours of the\
  \ bus trip. I keep expecting people to get off the bus, but every time they do,\
  \ at least one more person gets on and takes their place. After losing both of my\
  \ neighbours, I move to the window seat. There is a cool breeze on my face now.\
  \ My new neighbour takes a seat. She is a middle-aged woman wearing brown and doesn\u2019\
  t look especially friendly. Regardless, I try to ask her about our location. I use\
  \ Google Maps on my phone to point out Hatton, but she keeps repeating \u201Cno\
  \ signal\u201D. She offers me her own phone to use. I decline and look back outside\
  \ the window. About 10 minutes later, she comprehends my question. She taps me on\
  \ the shoulder, \u201CHatton! Hatton OK.\u201D She grins. This is enough of a confirmation\
  \ that I have not missed my stop. I offer her some of my crisps. She takes a few\
  \ and then shuffles through her bag and finds two lollies which she hands to me.\
  \ A while later she taps me on the shoulder and waves goodbye. I get a new neighbour.\
  \ \n\nThe road starts getting bumpier. The teenage boys behind me start playing\
  \ \u2018corners,\u2019 the same game a group of teenagers at home would play on\
  \ a similar road trip. With each bend, they crash their bodies into one another,\
  \ screeching and giggling while they do so. Although the game reminds me of my teenage\
  \ years, the tea plantations to the left and right are nothing like the dry bushland\
  \ of home. \n\nMy new neighbour offers me her snack. It looks like a large green\
  \ olive, but is attached to a branch. I try to bite into it, but this is clearly\
  \ wrong. She grabs her own, breaks it in half and then eats the inside. The inside\
  \ is a clear, white kind of colour and reminds me a little of a lychee. Another\
  \ woman comes through the back door of the bus carrying an infant. The man next\
  \ to my neighbour rises so she can sit. The bus is extremely squished, but I am\
  \ learning never to underestimate how many people can fit in a tight space. There\u2019\
  s a small commotion and then amongst the legs of all the standing people appears\
  \ a small girl. My neighbour grabs her by the hand and pulls her through the crowd\
  \ and on to her lap. I\u2019m certain that they have never met before and I am stunned\
  \ by the warmness and practicality of a complete stranger. I\u2019m ashamed by the\
  \ amount of space my own body takes up.\n\nAfter a few stops, the woman with the\
  \ two children gets off and another woman helps the older child down the stairs.\
  \ I\u2019m glad that the bus is finally starting to clear because we are  nearing\
  \ my stop. Just as I go to stand up, the road twists even more. I cannot stay on\
  \ my feet, let alone walk to the front of the bus. A man spots me and tells me to\
  \ sit back down until we get to my stop. He tells the driver to wait for me. He\
  \ is my English-speaking saviour, as I do not have the local language or the coordination\
  \ to navigate getting to the front and exiting the bus. Once I get off the bus,\
  \ all I can do is yell a quick \u2018thank you\u2019 to him from the side of the\
  \ road. I hope he got the message.\n\nOne simple bus ride and yet a myriad of examples\
  \ of kindness from strangers."
