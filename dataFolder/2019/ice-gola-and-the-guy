Text: "It was in this February, I Visited Mumbai for completion of my College Procedures\
  \ in NMIMS.\nAfter completion of my work I gave a visit to some relatives in Goregaon\
  \ West. \nAnd as the normal ritual follows of taking the Guest on Your of our Own\
  \ city. \nI followed their steps for some sightseeing. \nWe went to Juhu, a very\
  \ famous Beach Sprawling with Chowpatty food. \nThe Fresh Sea air flowing from the\
  \ Arabian sea at the West was playing with Handmade Wooden Air Spinners, showing\
  \ the Beauty of small things. \nWalking on moist beach sand felt so relaxing after\
  \ the days hustle around that big busy city. \nI enjoyed the time with my cousins\
  \ and had some spicy Mumbaiya food at the Chowpatty. \nChowpatty is really famous\
  \ for it's Big Ice Gola , At the end of our Picnic I grabbed one of Rose Flavor\
  \ popularly called 'Lal Gola' in Mumbai. \nWe hired a Taxi on our Way back home,\
  \ The Famous \" Kali-Pili\" Taxis. \nI sat on the window side, licking my Ice Gola\
  \ and continued to stare out of the window. \nJust after a moment as I was crossing\
  \ the fast moving streets in the taxi, My eyes seemed stuck to the Guy on the Bus\
  \ stand by the Road Side,Wearing a Bottle Green colored loose T-Shirt,paired with\
  \ light brown joggers and a backpack, his Justin Beiber Hairstyle covering his forehead\
  \ Unexpectedly we exchanged eye contact and unlike other situations, when caught\
  \ staring we still kept looking towards each other as the Vehicle moved forward\
  \ and till the time we lost sight of each other, I still wonder what could be the\
  \ reason behind his warm smile that he shared while the eye contact. At times you\
  \ don't need a large incidence to happen, such small coincidences or memories become\
  \ the best part of your Tour. \nI continued licking the Ice gola and kept thinking\
  \ about the heartfelt stranger and smiled to myself thinking I made a new friend\
  \ in the midst of such a busy city. \nI was happy to have a memory although unknown\
  \ but a sweet one back with me to routine."
