Text: "Waking up in Cuzco that morning, I had no idea I would be traveling to a part\
  \ of the Andes where only Quechua was spoken. Looking out my window, I sat on my\
  \ adobe tiled terrace with pink bougainvillea flowers adorning the colonial style\
  \ dark wood windowsills while drinking light green cocoa tea leaves from a terracotta\
  \ ceramic mug to heal my headache from the altitude. I heard the bells sounding\
  \ from Iberian cathedrals from centuries past combined with the wheels of the small\
  \ wooden carts descendants from the Inca Empire were pushing to sell their morning\
  \ vegetables and artisan trinkets. The streets were lined with bright pinks, turquoises,\
  \ reds, oranges, yellows, greens, and blues as the fabric market was opening to\
  \ my right. The locals would get up at sunrise to bring their handmade artifacts\
  \ to be sold in the traditional Spanish plaza painted in a light Easter pastel yellow,\
  \ with a tranquil Spanish stone fountain placed perfectly in the center peacefully\
  \ flowing with water. Inspired by the captivating colors and scene unfolding below,\
  \ I decided to pursue obtaining the one item I didn\u2019t have space for in my\
  \ backpack, an alpaca handwoven scarf to put around my neck.  \n\nWandering through\
  \ an artisan market in Cuzco is a gift because one has the experience to see craftmanship\
  \ that has been passed down for generations. Many of the residents of this part\
  \ of the world have never been on an airplane nor even left the Andes. Their lives\
  \ exist around preserving their sacred traditions high up in the Andes, fundamentally\
  \ untouched by modern civilization. While looking at a dark maroon scarf that had\
  \ a coloration so unique one could tell it was dyed by hand by local berries, I\
  \ was approached by a grandmother and her daughter who said in broken Spanish, \u201C\
  We have a better selection in our village. If you decide to come with another couple,\
  \ we will cook you a guinea pig for lunch and you can tour our weaving workshop.\u201D\
  \ \n\nThe ride up through the Sacred Valley took hours; however, where the ancient\
  \ ruins lined with tour buses end, a new part of the Andes exists where there is\
  \ nothing but mountains, blue sky, famers herding alpacas, and valleys full of green\
  \ grass as far as the eye can see. Farmers had intricately woven panchos possessing\
  \ deep greens, turquoises, oranges, yellows, and purples with brimmed hats boasting\
  \ impressive bright colored woven flowers on the brims. They used white ropes to\
  \ herd dozens of alpacas that were grazing freely surrounded by the background view\
  \ of the purple magnanimous Andes mountains. While driving on dirt roads, we climbed\
  \ even higher in the Andes to a village made of beige adobe dwellings where the\
  \ population must have not exceeded two-hundred. \n\nWhile sitting in one of the\
  \ most elaborate fabric shops I had ever seen adored with scarves, panchos, socks,\
  \ blankets, and hats in colors not yet used in Western fashion couture houses, I\
  \ sat there with three generations of female Inca descendants who were serving me\
  \ Cuy guinea pig with smiles as far as the eye could see. Our conversation was a\
  \ mixture of Quechua, sign language, common courtesies, and smiling. They winked\
  \ directing me towards the chestnut colored wooden looms carefully connected with\
  \ pure white strings behind them that were the evident creators of the masterpieces\
  \ within their shop. It was at that moment, out of the corner of my eye, diagonal\
  \ to my left, there was a lime green color so bright and fluorescent that it illuminated\
  \ the best features of lime and gold iridescent sparkles. Reaching for the handwoven\
  \ alpaca scarf, it was thicker, had several tassels on each side, and was stitched\
  \ with diagonal stitching that crossed in diamond shapes with such acute detail\
  \ that the craftmanship was flawless. The grandmother brought a mirror while wrapping\
  \ the bright lime green scarf around my neck, illuminating my green eyes, nodding\
  \ in agreement that I had indeed found my ideal alpaca scarf in a small village,\
  \ high in the Andes, where only Quechua was spoken."
