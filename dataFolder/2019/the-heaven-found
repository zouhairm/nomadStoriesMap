Text: "I have always dreamed of visiting Canada atleast once in my lifetime but never\
  \ in a million years I thought that I would actually get to visit Canada actually\
  \ and see it with my own eyes . As they say it is surely and truest a country of\
  \ heaven , so beautiful , serine , pure . As I got to talk to few people I came\
  \ to realise that the people were so sweet , down to earth as they helped me in\
  \ every possible way they could , OFCOURSE there will always be people who will\
  \ judge you and say bad things about you but that will never bring down the reputation\
  \ of those who actually are good and want to do good. I went to visit my aunt and\
  \ uncle they have 2 daughters and a cute adorable cat . They picked me up from the\
  \ airport and we went home , on our way I saw the streets filled with people carrying\
  \ out there lives and doing there daily activities , it made my heart happy because\
  \ I always wanted to visit the country and I was so fascinated by that . We picked\
  \ out our favourite Starbucks drink on our way back to home . Then after few hours\
  \ of relaxation we went to the park and let me tell you I haven\u2019t felt so good\
  \ sitting in a park ever in my life . There were children playing in that park and\
  \ living there best lives . I made some friends and played along with them as well\
  \ . I then played and exhausted myself badly then we had to return home because\
  \ the sun was going down . And Canada is so cold , I mean the cold weather was extreme\
  \ but thank god it never snowed during the time I was there . We then returned home\
  \ had dinner and went to doze off . The next day my cousins had to go to school\
  \ and I went along with them to take a sneak peek of there school , and the ride\
  \ was so good and smooth , we also got our Starbucks drinks and then got some breakfast\
  \ and returned home . Then in the afternoon time we went shopping and I am a huge\
  \ fan of that . I am obsessed with makeup as a result I shopped an lot only for\
  \ makeup and was a happy kid . We then went and had some lunch , went to take some\
  \ pictures in the sun . Had a great photoshoot and returned home . I went on and\
  \ showed my stuff to my sisters and played with their cat for some time and started\
  \ looking online for good places to visit in Canada specifically in Toronto . While\
  \ I was staying there I explored many resturaunts , tried new recipes , dishes ,\
  \ food whatever you wanna call it . I also did lot of heavy shopping . I took lot\
  \ of pictures as memories for my heart to remember the beautiful trip I always wanted\
  \ to have . I also saw the Niagara Falls , OMG  it was just massive , huge and gorgeous\
  \ to see Mother Nature creating such a beutiful thing . At the end  I would like\
  \ to thank my family for having me there and helping me in exploring my dream country\
  \ which I always wanted to . And Thankyou god for blessing me with a trip to Canada\
  \ because I for sure found my heaven there ."
