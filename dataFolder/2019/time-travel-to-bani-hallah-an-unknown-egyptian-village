Text: "Not without some challenges finding the right bus station, we set off with\
  \ our luggage tied precariously atop the micro-bus to the town of Somosta, where\
  \ Mustafa would come to meet us by \u201Ctaxi\u201D and take us to his hometown,\
  \ Bani Hallah. Ironically, my husband who had spent 3 months on an internship in\
  \ Egypt in 2012 where he made many friends, met Mustafa back home in Trinidad. Mustafa\
  \ was there on Islamic mission and the two of them immediately struck up a friendship\
  \ based on their shared faith and my husband\u2019s love for Egypt. \n\nMost friends\
  \ we saw in Cairo were quite perplexed that we planned to visit Bani Hallah. There\
  \ was no travel guide or blog post about here. Nonetheless, spurred on by my spirit\
  \ of adventure and wooed by the warmth of every Egyptian friend I\u2019d met thus\
  \ far, we were on our way! The landscape became dotted with lush green farms, dark\
  \ tributaries and signs of habitation, the air light and fresh. One wonders how\
  \ in the middle of this vast dessert you can find such vitality and flourishing\
  \ vegetation! \n\nWhen we arrived, we had to ask the bus driver to explain where\
  \ we were via phone to Moustafa so he could come and get us. It took me some time\
  \ to get my bearings. Getting off the bus in Somosta for me was like getting out\
  \ of a time travel machine. To my surprise Mustafa arrived for us in a motorcycle\
  \ rickshaw (not my idea of a taxi), but I was already adjusting to the landscape\
  \ of this remote Egyptian village. There were no cars, a handful of vans, many rickshaw\
  \ taxis and various forms of animal transport from horse carriages to donkey carts\
  \ and people riding the animals themselves. \n\nThe thing is I come from a small\
  \ village in a small island that most people have never really heard of. In theory,\
  \ this place should not be a shock for me. In more ways than one, its exactly like\
  \ home. The familiar scent of animal feces (I grew up opposite a cow farm) wafts\
  \ through the cool air and the dirt roads become more narrow as we ride in the rickshaw\
  \ carriage to Mustafa\u2019s house.  It\u2019s a fifteen-minute ride to Bani Hallah\
  \ \u2013 an even smaller farming village. Here, the streets are mere alleys made\
  \ of dirt. The houses are mostly raw concrete sometimes a part of the facade painted\
  \ in a bright color, some with intricate wrought iron doors. People are sitting\
  \ in the doorways observing us curiously as we pass by. \n\nWhen we arrived at their\
  \ house, greeted with warm smiles, embraces and \u201Csalaams\u201D abound, we were\
  \ ushered into the family room and sat on some cushions on the floor. There was\
  \ a tiny old television that played a recitation of Quran. Life here was completely\
  \ centered around Islam. Some of the women wore the full veil \u201Cniqab\u201D\
  \ while others just covered their head. Mustafa\u2019s mother \u2013 the matriarch\
  \ sat close to me and held my hand tenderly as we chatted \u2013 all very curious\
  \ about each other\u2019s life. \u201CWas there a grocery store here?\u201D, I inquired.\
  \ I soon found out there was no need for one. One of the sister\u2019s proudly took\
  \ me on a tour of the house and to see their barn \u2013 a small room annexed to\
  \ the house where they kept chickens and goats, that doubled as a classroom where\
  \ Mustafa would teach children from the village to read the Quran as a second job.\
  \ \n\nIn the evening we sat outside as was the custom in the village. We could see\
  \ the neighbors down the alley sitting out on their doorsteps while some of the\
  \ children played happily in the streets. The following day we would take a twenty-minute\
  \ walk to visit the family\u2019s farm. The time had come for them to call their\
  \ father who lived and worked in Saudi Arabia via WhatsApp. The house was equipped\
  \ with Wi-Fi, and its inhabitants were savvy with the most popular social media\
  \ apps, but Islamic cultural traditions set the tone. Life here was slow and simple,\
  \ their wages were not high, but they would never go hungry. Mashallah \u2013 God\
  \ has willed it."
