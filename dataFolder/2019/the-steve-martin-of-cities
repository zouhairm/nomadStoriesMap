Text: "Brussels is the Steve Martin of cities; somehow, managing to balance being\
  \ a renowned intellectual hub, cultural titan, and deeply silly. \n\nHome to the\
  \ Ren\xE9 Magritte museum, the city prides itself on its collection of, and connection\
  \ to, the great surrealist\u2019s work. Magritte is by far my favourite artist.\
  \ His work is magnetically beautiful but always with a sharp left turn. Every painting\
  \ exudes talent as well as seeming to say \u2018Go with me on this, it\u2019ll be\
  \ fun\u2019. In this, it perfectly captures the spirit of the Belgian capital. \n\
  \nFor all the intricate architecture and sophisticated institutions, there are colourful\
  \ splashes of joy. Huge murals of Herg\xE9\u2019s Tin-Tin appear between buildings.\
  \ There\u2019s the 102-metre-tall aluminium recreation of an atom called the Atomium\
  \ (get it?), which is not only enterable, but hosts a restaurant and several art\
  \ exhibits. The best example, however, has to be the statue of a small boy urinating\
  \ into a fountain, which has internationally reverential status. \n\nThe Manneken\
  \ Pis is possibly the only national landmark you\u2019re able to walk past without\
  \ noticing. \n\nTwice. \n\nI only managed it on the third attempt by spotting a\
  \ much larger recreation outside an adjacent gift shop selling hundreds of knockoffs,\
  \ many still larger than the original. That can\u2019t be good for the little man\u2019\
  s ego. \n\nThe unconventional Belgian landmark is also perhaps the only one whose\
  \ outfit is regularly changed. For me, it was \u201890s hip-hop artist\u2019. Admittedly,\
  \ it is easier to pull a sweater over, than, say, the Sphinx. But it does seem to\
  \ fit in with the Belgian sense of subtle quirkiness.\n\nOne thing the Belgians\
  \ do take seriously is the highway code; they frown heavily upon jay-walking. So,\
  \ when I later, unthinkingly, crossed the street and had a police motorbike whizz\
  \ past, lights flashing, gesticulating at me, I thought my trip might come to a\
  \ sudden end. A second bike immediately followed him. Then an armed car. This, to\
  \ me, seemed a tad excessive. When a couple more police cars hurtled past I looked\
  \ further up the street to see it was, in fact, Angela Merkel\u2019s motorcade on\
  \ the way to the European Commission. Always use zebra crossings in Brussels or\
  \ you could get hit by a world leader. \n\nBrussels is not the place to go to escape\
  \ Brexit. Then again, I\u2019m sure at this point there are even Bhutanese monastic\
  \ hermits who have an opinion on the Irish backstop. But if, like me, you have a\
  \ soft spot for visiting parliaments of the world, you\u2019ll find the European\
  \ Parliament one of the best designed to welcome visitors. It prides itself on transparency\
  \ - a word that comes up a surprising amount when speaking to locals about their\
  \ views of the democratic institution. The parliament even has its own onsite museum\
  \ \u2013 the Parlamentarium \u2013 which feels more like a modern science museum\
  \ than a dusty bureaucratic back-pat, with brightly coloured, high-tech interactive\
  \ exhibits. \n\nThe Grand Place, the huge, intricately built town square in the\
  \ centre of the city is an important visit, filled with open-air restaurants and\
  \ often live music. Be careful though \u2013 as soon as your bum hits the seat in\
  \ one of the bistros, you\u2019ll immediately be charged 15,000 euros. OK, that\u2019\
  s an exaggeration. But not much of one. Instead, take a saunter down the Rue Chair\
  \ et Pain. Apt, as you\u2019ll save yourself ruing the financial pain of a chair\
  \ in the Grand Place. The best spot is the Pizzeria Napoli Restaurant. Don\u2019\
  t let the Italian moniker fool you. Their speciality is the quintessentially Flemish\
  \ moules-frites. Sitting in the sun, you can get yourself a vat of mussels, a mountain\
  \ of chips and a cool Belgian beer for \u20AC15. Far better value - and you\u2019\
  re surrounded by all the fairytale-like buildings, including a charming toyshop\
  \ called The Grasshopper. \n\nI expected Brussels to be pretty and a cultural hot\
  \ spot. What I didn\u2019t expect to find was an immense sense of whimsy. \n\nLike\
  \ the paintings of Magritte, the cartoons of Herg\xE9, and the 102m pun you can\
  \ eat a waffle in, it\u2019s all just fun. \n\nBritain may have voted (indecisively)\
  \ to leave Brussels. But I\u2019ll be back, for sure."
