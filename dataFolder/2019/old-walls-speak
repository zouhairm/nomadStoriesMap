Text: "Villa Pottipatti, now a Neemrana property, was named after a village in Andhra\
  \ Pradesh. The Reddy family had moved to Bengaluru from there ages ago to build\
  \ their quaint English home\u2014an odd sight in the heart of Malleshwaram, a busy\
  \ but nondescript part of Bengaluru. I had read a few blogs before visiting and\
  \ most of them spoke of the wonderful wooden staircases, the beautifully decorated\
  \ rooms and the trees that coved in to create this astounding oasis-like character\
  \ within the busy-ness of Malleshwaram. \n\nWe arrived late that night and as we\
  \ walked up the haunting wooden staircase towards our Rajadurga room, the yellow\
  \ light struck me in sharp contrast. It bestowed a gloom to the overwhelming teak\
  \ around the house. My eyes fell on two wicker chairsfacing each other, a wooden\
  \ table dominating the centre. My tired swept into the past, to moments that may\
  \ have been\u2014or was it my imagination? I saw a man sit upright, a book in his\
  \ arms. A woman, dark hair, saree clad sat across him, sure of herself yet shifting\
  \ to gain attention from her man. \n\nUnable to distract her muse she walks up to\
  \ an attention-seeking record player. Warm Carnatic music sets in and she perches\
  \ herself onto the arm of the wicker chair where her man reads on, her saree fluttering\
  \ in the gushing wind from the terrace door in front.\nMy mind was playing up, I\
  \ was sure.\n\nI woke up late, in the blur of the morning light that filtered through\
  \ the netting on the window keeping the insects and mosquitos away. And my attention\
  \ was drawn to the vision outside the window, to the sun-soaked iron terrace chairs\
  \ and that man in his crisp white kurta and white lungi, while the woman in her\
  \ beautifully draped pale pink saree with a gold border fixed them tea. \n\nThe\
  \ man held up a newspaper, my eyes squinting to read the headlines, but little came\
  \ to my vision through the wire mesh of the window. Was this their routine? Did\
  \ they do this every morning on the terrace of Villa Pottipatti? Did they have children?\
  \ Did they go to work? My curiosity was brimming\u2014was he a prosperous businessman\
  \ or did he believe in serving others? I rushed out to the terrace and the soft\
  \ pink of the flowering tree that had dived into my vision claimed right to first\
  \ sight! Yes, I didn\u2019t know this shade of pink, I didn\u2019t know the name\
  \ of the flower\u2014only a new shade of pink. It filled me with joy and I could\
  \ involuntarily feel my spirit soar as I strained through the branches of the tree\
  \ to look below.\n\nLively voices crept in; the hustle-bustle within the house,\
  \ a man cycling away with large jackfruits balanced on the sides of his cycle, a\
  \ gardener waving out to him as if to wish him a good sell. Three men stepped out\
  \ of the front verandah dressed in half-Indian, half-English attire, determined\
  \ to make the day worthy of a story to tell their waiting women when they got home.\
  \ A car drove in and the men set off. I didn't spot the women, probably waving them\
  \ success somewhere.  I was visiting Bengaluru with a purpose, on work, a mission\
  \ to complete\u2014but this place with its mysterious walls and unusually planned\
  \ rooms had caught my attention in a strange lilting fashion. I had drifted into\
  \ a story that confused me and drew me in, all at the same time.\n\nDressed for\
  \ work, I stepped into an open garden with a few garden chairs and tables and while\
  \ I waited for my coffee, the garage door was being opened, the hustle and bustle\
  \ being guided by the woman I had spotted earlier, still in her pale pink saree.\
  \ But she looked different\u2014the softness of her face, or her eyes, now astute,\
  \ knowing where to manoeuvre\u2026did I think she was soft and helpless? I was mistaken!\n\
  \nIt was time for me to rush out, my Ola had arrived. I set off for the day, looking\
  \ back at Villa Pottipatti. The house definitely had more stories to tell."
