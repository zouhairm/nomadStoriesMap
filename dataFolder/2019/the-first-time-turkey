Text: "To go to Turkey, it was not that much easy. Being the elder makes me fight\
  \ for every single demand. Plus that the country i'm traveling to, politically we\
  \ are not friends and my father is a police officer which is not good for him to\
  \ let his daughter go there. The point i used that travelling to Turkey is very\
  \ useful for my to improve the language as i'm a student at The Faculty Of Languages,\
  \ Turkish Department. Facing my insistence they agreed, however they were  afraid.\
  \ I went to Turkey as a volunteer to teach Arab refugees there women rights. I went\
  \ alone. To be honest i was afraid.It was the first time to go somewhere alone with\
  \ no one i even know. I felt like all people looking at me wondering is that young\
  \ girl travelling alone! But i looked around me found that people are normal and\
  \ know one even noticing me. i got deep breath and lifted up my head with confident\
  \ gaving my passport to police and shortly i entered the country. \n   As a girl\
  \ travelling to a new country for 6 weeks can you imagine how big my suitcase was!\
  \ Words can't describe how hard it was. It was taller a heavier than i can lift\
  \ and i didn't realize that as my parents were with me all the time carrying it\
  \ for me. Honestly i was expecting that someone will help me as i look miserable\
  \ and if i were in Egypt we used to help people when we realize that they need help.\
  \ But it was first culture shock. People in Turkey are so friendly if they know\
  \ you. If they can trust you. So i reminded myself that i'm strong and smart enough\
  \ to handle it. And yes it was handled starting pulling my suitcase till i reached\
  \ the bus that will carry me to Istanbul (the capital city). \n   I met the Turkish\
  \ guys that were responsible to lead me to the family i'm gonna stay with. And actually\
  \ staying with a host family is the best decision i took before travelling. I should\
  \ choose from staying in a hostel or with host family. At the beginning i was afraid\
  \ to stay with people i don't know. May they would not like me or i would not like\
  \ them. But i thought that all the experience is up normal for me so i should conquer\
  \ my fear and live the adventure as it is, with it 's pros and cons. \n   The Turkish\
  \ guys were so nice they pulled the suitcase till we reached the host family's home.\
  \ I stayed with a girl above thirty lives on her own leaving her family to be nearer\
  \ to her workplace. Istanbul is a big city very crowded has a weird mixture between\
  \ east an west. when you look at its mosques and the old Muslims' way of speaking\
  \ and behaving you can feel the warmness of eastern countries. but young people\
  \ ,new skyscrapers, shopping malls and buildings you can live the freedom of western\
  \ countries. \n   My host girl told me a lot about Turkey at that time. We compared\
  \ policies, religions, prices between Turkey and Egypt. We talked about everything\
  \ in life, my life and her life. She has a lovely story. First she was working in\
  \ a bank as a security member as she completed high school only. While she working\
  \ as a security she applied for university and got bachelor so she could work at\
  \ the same bank but as an accountant.\n   The mixture between east and west is the\
  \ special thing that you can notice easy. In Turkey you can feel home as long as\
  \ you are acting like a Turkish, or at least showing respect to Turkey and its people.And\
  \ i think that's we should do already wherever we go."
