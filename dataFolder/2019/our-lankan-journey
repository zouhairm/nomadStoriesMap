Text: "So there we were at the airport, about to hail to srilanka. The country in\
  \ the lap of nature and in the reminiscence of history. After a flight from Delhi,\
  \ as we were about to land, what we saw below was more than beautiful. From a rocky\
  \ concrete city to a country so green and heavily forested. It was an astonishing\
  \ experience. As we landed and got out of the airport our journey started towards\
  \ bentota, the faviroute coastal city of srilanka.\nBentota had to offer much more\
  \ than beaches and good shacks. The people back at the wunderbar hotel were sweethearts,\
  \ so welcoming and comforting. The surroundings were nothing less than surreal and\
  \ the land welcomed us again.\nBentota was a journey i can never forget in my life,\
  \ and the togetherness of the family made it even more special. The beaches and\
  \ the railway track adjacent to them without any barrier, or the shack and the resort\
  \ next to it made the every morning view more memorable.. It felt as though we wanted\
  \ to never leave this place.. I never wanted to leave this fairytale land and will\
  \ see it soon for sure.. I hope its beauty is retained\n\n\n\nTravel is my life\
  \ biggest dream.. I want to explore the world all over and there is no better place\
  \ than starting from europe, which is the beauty of history captured in architecture\
