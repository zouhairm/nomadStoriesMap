Text: "Streetlights, tarmac and trucks melted into swirling walls of dusty orange\
  \ and carpets of midnight black, sand pelting every inch of bare skin and lining\
  \ the seams of our belongings with a tangerine hue. \n\nThe customary call-to-prayer\
  \ was a soothing greeting, welcoming us into a seemingly parallel universe as we\
  \ broke through the dancing particles of the dust storm and into the cool recycled\
  \ air of the plane, laced with wisps of incense. A safety video and a sip of water\
  \ later, my parents, my brother and I, accompanied by a small air crew and a family\
  \ of enthusiastic academics, took off into the Saudi skies.\n\nArriving at the only\
  \ hotel in Al Ula, we were embraced by Arabic arches decorated with henna patterns,\
  \ sweeping courtyards and an outdated dining room. A couple of lingering tourists\
  \ sipped black tea; a gentle reminder that this was like no other trip. This was\
  \ travelling in Saudi Arabia under the same strict Sharia law we had become accustomed\
  \ to in Riyadh but without the comfort of our own home and the Western adaptations\
  \ of our residential concrete oasis. \n\nBuzzing with anticipation and excitement\
  \ the next morning, my mom and I dressed in our abayas, my dad and my brother in\
  \ shorts and t-shirts, we ensured we had our letter of permission to visit and take\
  \ photographs of Mada\u2019in Saleh. Declared a UNESCO Heritage site, but largely\
  \ untouched and unknown to many, there were formalities to tick off the list before\
  \ visiting. This wasn\u2019t just a holiday, it was an unspoken lesson in culture\
  \ and respect.\n\u201CHas everyone put on sun cream?\u201D my mom asked us. Perhaps\
  \ it was just like any other holiday. \n\nThe first stop of the day was just an\
  \ appetizer of what we were going to see, or so I thought. The museum, with a train\
  \ protruding from its walls as if captured in time, struck me as eerily quiet for\
  \ its size and the wealth of history it held. The sixteen old railway houses spoke\
  \ a louder truth. The museum was part of an expansive Ottoman era pilgrim station,\
  \ formerly part of the Hejaz Railway which ran from Medina to Damascus, connecting\
  \ Mada\u2019in Saleh to Petra in Jordan. \n\nMada\u2019in Saleh is extraordinary.\
  \ Cavernous tombs and temples intricately carved out of sunset-coloured rock crop\
  \ out of the desert like candles on a birthday cake. Winding through the sandstone\
  \ structures, I marvelled at casts of regal birds sculpted at the porticos and wondered\
  \ at the inscriptions on the walls which dated back thousands of years to the Nabatean\
  \ civilisation. Were they notes of devotion to a loved one, or a curse warding off\
  \ anyone who dares enter the tomb? In search of answers and shade from the sweltering\
  \ heat, we left the Nabatean caravan trail. \n\nNestled under the date palms in\
  \ the valley, an elderly man dressed head-to-toe in a traditional thawb and leather\
  \ sandals invited our group to join him. He led us to a sparsely decorated veranda,\
  \ furnished with little but a horseshoe of ruby-red cushions. The scent of cardamom\
  \ and sticky dates filled the air as a silver tray with golden-rimmed glasses and\
  \ embellished coffee pots were set before us. Thirteen-years-old and exhausted,\
  \ I collapsed on the closest cushion, provoking a chuckle from our company. Embarrassed\
  \ and unsure about what I had done, I turned to my parents who looked equally perplexed.\
  \ The elderly man offered us coffee \u2013 a gesture of friendship. We were told\
  \ that where I\u2019d sat was normally reserved for the male head of the family\
  \ at the date plantation, but on this occasion, tradition was overlooked in place\
  \ of hospitality.\n\nAs mesmerising constellations appeared, we returned to the\
  \ desert, recounting our experiences as Ahmad drew a roaring fire. Regardless of\
  \ their carvings or the purpose assigned to them centuries ago, the fading light\
  \ reduced the sculpted caves around us to mere silhouettes. Two unweighted columns\
  \ of rock rose to one plateau. With a magnificent arch separating the columns, the\
  \ resemblance was uncanny in the dusk. We saw an elephant in the desert."
