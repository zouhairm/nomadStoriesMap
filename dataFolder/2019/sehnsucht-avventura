Text: "Atop the steepest bridge I had ever traversed, firmly gripping the steering\
  \ wheel of my white FIAT cinquecento rental, I slowly released the clutch, inching\
  \ forward in bumper to bumper traffic on a hot August afternoon. Please God, don\u2019\
  t let this amazing adventure end in a fender bender. \n\nUnlikely catch my flight\
  \ out of Punta Raisi, I relaxed into watching my traffic neighbors. Tiny cars filled\
  \ with bronzed beach goers. Where is everyone going? Am I missing something even\
  \ more amazing than everything I just experienced on this beautiful island?\n\n\
  I arrived in Palermo by accident. My love for Sicily became a choice. It is the\
  \ Mediterranean\u2019s largest, most colorful, and most vivacious island after all!\n\
  \nRaised in a small Austrian town, I was immediately smitten with that intriguing\
  \ country only 900 kilometers south of us! Studying Latin from the age of eleven,\
  \ I was determined it would one day be useful on my dream trip to Italy. Heartbroken\
  \ by a family decision to relocate to a country located 7,000 kilometers away, those\
  \ early years provided the fondest memories and eventual feelings of Sehnsucht;\
  \ A German word to describe longing or yearning that loosely translates to the addiction\
  \ to see.\n\nTen years on, life changed. My family faced turmoil and I watched my\
  \ sister become a mother. I picked up a few degrees and a very Canadian boyfriend\
  \ along the way. Feeling conflicted about my relationship and a path of marketable\
  \ skills and prestige, now was the time to give myself the experience of Italy I\
  \ had always envisioned. It was time to follow my own choices and my intuition.\
  \  The mission was simple. Fulfill the drive to explore Italy, read ancient Latin\
  \ writing, and eat cannoli in its birthplace! I contacted an old family friend and\
  \ my sister\u2019s former love interest that was now living in Milan and offered\
  \ to meet in Sicily, promising \u201CSicily is an Avventuraaa! Its food is Europe\u2019\
  s best. The people are passionate!\u201D \n\nDriving 264 kilometers eastward from\
  \ Palermo to Catania, I was enthralled by shades of turquoise, arid hills, and olive\
  \ trees. Arriving to meet my family friend, we sat outdoors indulging in Frutti\
  \ di Mare pasta in the heart of the Piazza Duomo. He and my sister were deeply in\
  \ love during their younger years. Despite my initial reluctance to share her news,\
  \ he mustered the kindest words of congratulations on her new chapter with noticeable\
  \ woe. \u201CShe is a remarkable woman. I am very happy for her\u2026Should we have\
  \ dessert?\u201D Indulging in crunchy, pistachio dipped cannoli we carried on with\
  \ talk about the future. \n\nI continued eastward to Taormina and the glistening\
  \ beach town of Mazzaro. Onward to Agrigento and the ancient Valley of the Temples,\
  \ I was proud to discover that all that Latin held up.  The Sehnsucht was gone.\
  \ \n\nDelighted to check into my flight on time and granting myself one more Panini\
  \ and Pellegrino at the gate, I contemplated the road awaiting me back home. \u201C\
  Un Pellegrino e un panino per favore\u201D was met by question that would change\
  \ my life forever. \u201CAmerican?\u201D I turned to meet the most generous, affectionate,\
  \ and handsome man I had ever met in my life; a fellow impulsive traveler who muted\
  \ all of the noise. I was immediately smitten. Eight years onward, I know that I\
  \ had found Sicily\u2019s greatest attraction. I remain grateful for prior years\
  \ of Sehnsucht as it gave me the greatest Avventura of my life."
