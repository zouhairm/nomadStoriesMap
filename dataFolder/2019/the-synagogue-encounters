Text: "If I\u2019d met Levi at a metro station or at work, I wouldn\u2019t have given\
  \ him a second glance. He looked more or less like an Indian, spoke Hindi and was\
  \ dressed in a kurta. However, I met him at a place of worship, where he wore a\
  \ strange rimless cap and spoke a language that I couldn\u2019t understand. \nHow\
  \ patriotic can one become towards a country which is not their homeland? \n \n\
  Earlier that day, my 70-year-old friend Ella, who\u2019d been backpacking in India\
  \ for the last 3 months, had come to Mumbai, a city where i\u2019ve been spending\
  \ time recently. In the middle of exploring the city, a recently painted bright\
  \ blue facade caught our attention, Ella read something on it written in a foreign\
  \ language. \u2018\u2019It\u2019s a Synagogue!\u2019\u2019 she exclaimed excitedly\
  \ and hurried into the building, beckoning me.\n \nThere were a few men gathered\
  \ inside, wearing rimless caps that I later learned were called kippahs. A tall,\
  \ slender man with curly dark hair, mysterious eyes and sun-baked brown skin that\
  \ hinted at exotic roots walked towards us. Ella greeted him with a \u201CShalom\u201D\
  , and he introduced himself to us as Levi. He was able to speak to Ella in Hebrew\
  \ and quickly switch to Hindi with me. Who was he?\n \nWhile they spoke, I admired\
  \ my surroundings. It was my first time at a synagogue. The Keneseth Eliyahoo has\
  \ Neoclassic architecture with Minton tile floors, the walls were painted in Victorian\
  \ pale greens, contrasting with the matte white pillars, the Star of David painted\
  \ in gold was a repeating element in the trusses. The setting sun cast a soft light\
  \ that was broken into multiple rainbows by the stained-glass windows. I was then\
  \ dragged into the conversation as Levi switched to Hindi to suggest me some nearby\
  \ local cafes to taste authentic Mumbai snacks, I still kept wondering who this\
  \ man was.\n \nWas he a hippie who had come to India and never left, or did he fall\
  \ in love with an Indian and moved here for good? Before my mind could cook up some\
  \ more stories, I interrupted him asking where he was from. He said \u201CDadar,\
  \ Mumbai.\u201D \u201CYou speak Hebrew though,\u201D I wondered confusedly. What\
  \ he told was nothing that i had imagined.\n \nIn 1939 Levi\u2019s grandmother,\
  \ who had lost her whole family in the Jewish genocide, was fleeing the country\
  \ along with her 2 daughters and a son (Levi's father) in a kind trader\u2019s sailboat.\
  \ After being refused by many countries who suspected that they were Nazi spies,\
  \ she finally found her way to Mumbai. Heartbreaking images of his grandmother spending\
  \ weeks in the sailboat, waiting to see land, and her gnawing anxiety at not being\
  \ let in flashed through my mind.\n \n\u201CAfter that, Mumbai became our home and\
  \ adopted us as its own, however we a shrinking community today, many people migrated\
  \ to israel and other european countries and I am happy for being able to renovate\
  \ this place. Thanks to the local corporates who funded this. \u201D He said. When\
  \ I asked him why he didn\u2019t consider moving back, his eyes widened. He shrugged\
  \ his shoulders and said \u201CI am an Indian.\u201D It was that simple. And that\
  \ overwhelming.\n \nAs Ella and I made our way back home, we got caught in the evening\
  \ rush, by the local train station, and were swamped in people- women wearing niqabs,\
  \ men in turbans, students, office-goers in western formals, women in elegant saris,\
  \ catholic nuns, men with orange teka and many tourists. It filled me with regret.\n\
  \ \nRegret at all the times I cribbed about the densely packed local trains, all\
  \ the times I scoffed at the constant crowds that ruined the serenity of Mumbai\
  \ beaches, all the times I complained about the smaller living spaces and the traffic.\
  \ Yes, Mumbai is a crowded city, but only because it has welcomed everyone. It may\
  \ not have done a few things right, but it opened its arms to so many immigrants\
  \ from different places all over the world and today, 25 million people call Mumbai\
  \ home. I\u2019m filled with pride and joy every time I am reminded of this city\u2019\
  s big heart."
