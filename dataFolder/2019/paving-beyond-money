Text: "Velliangiri Hills -The south of kailash. Imagine a place beyond 8 mountains\
  \ into the forest which have a temple at the top. A tantri to do the rituals and\
  \ aghoras which never comes down even to drink a drop of water. That too in Tamil\
  \ Nadu. Sounds like myth right? \n\n Not much knows about this place and the view,\
  \ culture, dignity, and the love this place have. Velliangiri hills- a mountain\
  \ after 7 other mountains with no other modes of transportation other than legs.\
  \ This astonishing mountain range lies in \nBoluvampatti forest range in Tamil Nadu,\
  \ about 40km from coimbatore. The entrance to this mountains is from a temple named\
  \ Poondi temple which is one of the ancient temples in India. The most interesting\
  \ part which drives the travellers here is that most of them are not travellers.\
  \ They are pilgrims of lord shiva trekking the mountains just to see a shiva linga\
  \ at the top of the eighth mountain. Those who thrive to see agoras, this is the\
  \ place, those who wish to hike and pray,  this is the place, those who wants to\
  \ enjoy nature, this is the place. Velliangiri hills which is having an altitude\
  \ of 6000m and an elevation of 1775m. \n         You might be thinking what a 1775m\
  \ heighted mountain can show you. But the fact is that, as i said earlier there\
  \ are 8 mountains in the way to reach the top and you have to climb every single\
  \ one of them and then CLIMB THEM DOWN,  and there comes the other one. Infact each\
  \ of this mountains are 1km apart too..which means you have to walk about 8km inside\
  \ the dense forest with only a torch as source of light. \n\nWe started by 10 at\
  \ night targeting to get the sunrise from top. The first 2km that is the first two\
  \ mountains was not easy cause they had rock cutted steps. After each mountains\
  \ there were small shops having water and other soft drinks. The funny thing about\
  \ this shops are, as every mountains gets passed, the rate of the items in the shops\
  \ gets doubled. We had to buy a one litre water bottle for 60 ruppes ( after minutes\
  \ of bargaining). The third and forth mountains was slopes and were more greenish\
  \ than any of the other mountains. We could easily walk or even run through them\
  \ as it was not a dangerous place at all. After the first 4km that is first 4 mountains\
  \ came the real piece of work. We had to walk by four legs after that if you know\
  \ what i mean. The left side of that mountain was full of caves ditches and cracks\
  \ and if we lose balance even for a second, we will be falling toba depth of about\
  \ 1600m from sea level. God knows what lies under. After two mountains like that\
  \ then we reach the final two kilometers of our journey. The seventh mountain was\
  \ the coldest of all others and was very foggy. It even had a small stream flowing\
  \ through centre where the water waa crystal clear and ice cold. \n     After 7\
  \ and half hours of continuous trekking, we reached the top by 5.05 in the morning\
  \ at the top. The peak of the eight mountain had a temple with two huge rectangle\
  \ shaped rock of about 70-90m length kept in a way that there is a small triangle\
  \ shaped gap in between them where the shiva linga is placed. There was even a tantri\
  \ to do the rituals. When we reached there, we had one other group of trekkers,\
  \ a dozen of pilgrims and couple of aghoras. The opposite side of temple was a very\
  \ spacious place where people could sleep, make tent and it even had a photo point\
  \ at the edge which is breath taking. \n     \nIts not easy to get there, but once\
  \ you make it to the top, i can guarantee you. The one second sight of this place\
  \ will change your life as whole. Go and see. Only then you will know."
