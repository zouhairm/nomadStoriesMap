Text: "Ever since I was a child, the excitement of travelling to an unknown destination\
  \ has always made me smile and look forward to the journey. There is something so\
  \ beautiful about seeing\nthe place with your own eyes, and discovering it for the\
  \ first time, therefore I recommend not to Google it before you go, because when\
  \ you go with fresh perspective and a willing heart to unravel the beauty and mystery\
  \ of the unknown destination, you will be surprised to find out more than what you\
  \ will expect to find. \n\nMy recent trip to Dubai broke a lot of misconceptions\
  \ and preconceived notions about the country that I secretly feared to visit. But\
  \ considering the fact that I had never gone out of the country before and deciding\
  \ Dubai as my first did take me several months to consider. For a start, the place\
  \ did fascinate me always and looking at the distance and time it will take me,\
  \ considering the fact I did not have many days to spare, Dubai seemed a fair option.\
  \ So I booked\nmy tickets and looked forward to my first ever international trip.\
  \ \n\nI landed at night, too tired and hungry to go anywhere but I decided to overcome\
  \ my slumber and make the most of my trip. I stopped at Dubai Festival Mall for\
  \ a light meal since it was on the way, and I was hungry and continued the ride\
  \ towards Downton Dubai, and I was blown away. Dubai should be known as the City\
  \ of Lights, the roads, skyscrapers; main road are all so well lit. As I looked\
  \ out the window I could see just one long road flanked by skyscrapers on either\
  \ side, the pathways are decorated with lights and looks like Christmas in February.\
  \ It was a beautiful night, the sky was clear and the full moon shining brightly\
  \ could be seen behind this beautiful majestic masterpiece as the world knows, Burj\
  \ Khalifa. Coming from Delhi, the air in Dubai was so refreshing. My first night\
  \ in Dubai started to a good start, and I was looking forward to spending two more\
  \ days in discovering more beauty in this stunning place.\n\nDay two started with\
  \ a long drive to the desert safari camp that took us two hours to reach. While\
  \ Dubai is known for its hot weather and dry heat, surprisingly it was quite pleasant\
  \ and requires you to wear a warm scarf or a light cardigan. The camp was crowded\
  \ with tourists; children were having a time of their lives riding the desert bike,\
  \ while I waited in anticipation for my desert safari ride. The tires need to flat\
  \ before entering the desert; otherwise the car gets stuck and cannot move in the\
  \ sand. Did you know that driving in a desert needs a special licence along with\
  \ your regular driving licence? However, nothing could have prepared me for that\
  \ safari, it was the bestroller-coaster ride I have ever been in and it will blow\
  \ your mind out. Let me just say that driving in the desert requires an art, it\
  \ like a stroke of brush\ngliding gently on the canvas, going high and low. The\
  \ secret to have a good time is having a good driver who is not only willing to\
  \ show off his skills but also boasting the beauty of his country by making your\
  \ experience unforgettable and for taking you to the highest and untouched sand\
  \ dune, which can only be reached by the bravest who try. \n\nTo stand there in\
  \ middle of the desert and surrounded by sand and nothing else, that\u2019s when\
  \ it hit me; the vastness of our world and the beauty and charm that surrounds it.\
  \ It was overwhelming to stand there and just take in; to be a part of something\
  \ so beautiful which otherwise seems so ordinary. \n\nAt the end of my journey as\
  \ I packed my bags, I couldn\u2019t help but smile. This trip may have been short,\
  \ but I\u2019m carrying a lifetime of memories with me back home. My heart is so\
  \ full of happiness and warmth and I look forward to make many more memories and\
  \ going on many more amazing journeys and countries."
