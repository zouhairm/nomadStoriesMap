Text: "Life provides us with moments that are embedded in our memories and stay with\
  \ us a life time. One of those being the morning I woke up on my bus from Munich;\
  \ I was in absolute awe of the beauty that Croatia so willingly shared with me from\
  \ that moment onward. \nSplit took some time to adjust to, my first opinion on it\
  \ was a bit downbeat; beyond the old city I felt as if everything in Split was destitute,\
  \ my exact thought was \u201Coh boy and I am stuck here for a week\u201D. The beauty\
  \ of staying in a place longer than a few days meant that I was able to learn more\
  \ about the city that first shocked me and the history behind it. My outlook on\
  \ Split quickly changed; I realised that Croatia was a war-stricken country filled\
  \ with devastation, with skeleton\u2019s of the war still haunting the locals. All\
  \ the same, it was amazing to witness; despite all that devastation the people were\
  \ genuinely happy.\n\nMy days consisted of lazing on the local\u2019s beach where\
  \ I caught a burn, read a book, enjoyed cooling off in the refreshingly crystal\
  \ clear Adriatic Sea; which was a collection of different shades of blue and green,\
  \ indulging in super creamy ice cream whilst taking long walks either along the\
  \ coast, chasing the sunset up towards Marjan Hill, or whilst gazing over the city\
  \ by night. I was in paradise.\n\nIf you follow the cobblestones from the center\
  \ of the old city, starting at the clock tower, moving in an easterly direction,\
  \ remembering to admire the beauty of the architecture of the buildings; the perfection\
  \ of their detail, you will soon land up at The Green Market; a fresh produce marketplace.\
  \ I often found myself drawn to it, buying fresh pomegranates, dried figs, dates\
  \ or just to observe; I loved its buzz and watching the way everyone interacted\
  \ with each other, whilst greeting, laughing or sharing their day.\n\nOn my final\
  \ day, I had chosen to do an island-hopping tour. I set off bright and early, my\
  \ day continually being filled with surprises. The day consisted of dipping in the\
  \ turquoise sea, enjoying the most divine fish and freshly baked bread, tasting\
  \ local wine and interacting with fellow travellers; which I found just as refreshing\
  \ as taking a dip in the sea. I had the opportunity to snorkel; where I found myself\
  \ encircled by an elegant lustre of silver, as a school of fish whirled around me\
  \ it was something quite magnificent. We ended the trip on a quaint island called\
  \ S\u014Flta, I bought myself an ice cream and wandered through the island, a perfect\
  \ end to the trip. I boarded the boat with a happy heart, gazing out at the vast\
  \ ocean as we headed back towards Split; welcomed in by a school of dolphins.\n\n\
  During this trip I was able to discover a new country, as well as experience a period\
  \ of self discovery. I came to realise how much I loved meeting new people and listening\
  \ to their stories. It taught the introvert in me that I needed to take a leap of\
  \ faith and share my story in hope to meet new people, which I did. Most nights\
  \ ended in the early hours of the morning, it was captivating sitting up listening\
  \ to the other traveller\u2019s stories; we discussed and giggled over the mishaps\
  \ of home countries and shared the experiences we have had whilst travelling abroad.\
  \ One night I chatted to the receptionist; a local of Split \u2013 she shared her\
  \ travels, the history of Croatia and the affects the war had on her family, I was\
  \ particularly moved that she shared that part of her life with me.  I watched a\
  \ soccer game at a bar with an Australian; Ukraine played against Croatia, the Croatian\
  \ team won - to be there, in that atmosphere was exhilarating, I will always treasure\
  \ that memory.\n\nCroatia surprised me with the hospitality its people shared, the\
  \ beauty it held, and the history it told. There is nothing quite like leaving a\
  \ new place with a happier heart that holds a handful of new memories and new perspectives."
