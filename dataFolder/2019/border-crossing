Text: "I had crossed a quite a few borders before by bus and plane, but neither I\
  \ nor you will forget the checkpoint at Poipet, the crossing between Thailand and\
  \ Cambodia. I was heading to Cambodia in search of new stories and adventure, but\
  \ nothing could have prepared me for this.\nThe town of Poipet was a scorching hot\
  \ post-apocalyptic wasteland. The city was small but bustling with energy. The biggest\
  \ source of the economy here was stemming from scamming the tourists crossing or\
  \ the two large casinos casting their nauseous neon lights upon the dense dirt of\
  \ the messy road. At the customs checkpoint, there was a large overhang titled 'Kingdom\
  \ of Cambodia' with the iconic temple style of Angor Wat. Upon stopping, our bus\
  \ driver spoke over the intercom. \n\t\"Okay, we have arrived now. Please wait for\
  \ a few minutes. Follow signs to customs and visa checkpoint and ignore all people\
  \ who try to sell you things or give you directions,\" he said. We were parked in\
  \ front of the Grand Diamond City Casino, people flowing in and out trying to make\
  \ new luck in their world.\n\nI looked out my window and saw a woman with a toddler\
  \ and a baby an arm's reach away. The setting was bleak, with garbage scattered\
  \ around and a small bag I imagined containing her possessions. The woman was wearing\
  \ a battered, pink one-piece dress, the older child was wearing a batman shirt with\
  \ no bottoms. The baby was naked and in only a grimy towel separating the child\
  \ from mother earth. It looked small - too small- and the newborn ball of sunshine\
  \ was barely moving. The mother kept attempting to feed from a milky bottle but\
  \ to no avail. They looked like they had never had a real shower in ages, let alone\
  \ access to soap and clean water.\n\nThe baby started wailing, not crying because\
  \ it was either too hot or too dehydrated to produce tears. The mother picked the\
  \ baby up and tried to relax the little sweetheart. She cried out whimpering Khmer\
  \ while rocking the bundle of joy back and forth. She grabbed a small unknown bottle\
  \ that was droplets away from death and attempted to feed the baby. I wondered what\
  \ its name was, or if I could even pronounce it, or what future it may lead. The\
  \ toddler's stoic impression displayed this was a common occurrence, paying no attention\
  \ to his mother. He was too preoccupied sketching in the dusty road with a sharp\
  \ stick. \n\nI kept thinking of ways I could try to help this family. Whether I\
  \ could give money, clothes, a blanket, or even the illegible Asian snacks our bus\
  \ operator gave to us passengers. From what I could see, anything could help. I\
  \ decided that I would give them ten U.S. dollars. In Cambodia the dollar is standard,\
  \ and their own Cambodian Riel is worth so little that it's equivalent to our quarters,\
  \ nickels, and dimes.\n\nI exited the bus behind the other passengers and I started\
  \ walking towards the family. The pant-less superhero stood before me and stuck\
  \ his hand out immediately. I pulled the cash from my pocket and he quickly grabbed\
  \ it. He then dashed across the street and handed my ten-dollar bill to a leathery\
  \ man dressed in a bright red polo, clean sunglasses, and fresh khaki shorts behind\
  \ a street stand peddling wares. The man gave the boy a pat on the head, a small\
  \ bottle of water and a bag of chips before sending back across the street towards\
  \ the woman and her baby. \t\n\nI stood there completely stunned, wondering why\
  \ or how anyone could do such a thing. I gave her all my food and the rest of my\
  \ Thai currency. I made eye contact with the woman and I swear we both shed a tear\
  \ at the same time. She nodded and said some words I couldn't understand. I guess\
  \ the house always wins."
