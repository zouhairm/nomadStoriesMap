Text: "We met Nordine on a sunny Wednesday morning. His tan skin revealed how he spends\
  \ many hours outside planting as well as tending to the already planted almond trees\
  \ throughout the remote village of Irzaine. He proudly walked us through one of\
  \ the fields with growing trees while explaining how time is still needed for those\
  \ almonds to be ready for sale. Witnessing Nordine\u2019s passion for his work in\
  \ Irzaine, you would never guess that he once had extravagant plans to leave Morocco\
  \ behind and travel and work abroad. But he did, and he happily rejected those big\
  \ plans to, instead, give back to the community in which he grew up.\n\n\tNordine\
  \ explained: while studying at university in Rabat, he was inspired by a combination\
  \ of his experiences at school, a friend, and his passion for helping others; he\
  \ joined a student association involved in development work and was a member for\
  \ five years. Instead of moving abroad after graduation as originally planned, Nordine\
  \ returned to Irzaine and created his first development work association; he later\
  \ created a second association focused on providing clean water; and Nordine\u2019\
  s latest project is an almond production and valorization cooperative, established\
  \ in 2014.\n\n\tIn the time since, a total of 124,800 almond trees have been planted\
  \ across 600 hectares of land, at a ratio of 208 trees per hectare. Some planting\
  \ is financed by Morocco\u2019s Ministry of Agriculture, some financed by donors;\
  \ planting on 400 of the 600 hectares was financed by a Belgian government agency.\
  \ Nordine reported that the cooperative supports 342 beneficiaries in Irzaine. Its\
  \ establishment has created jobs and not only strengthened the community\u2019s\
  \ economy but also its identity. Notably, the cooperative has had the power to persuade\
  \ local people to stay in the village. Like Nordine did years ago, many community\
  \ members are rejecting the once-popular idea to leave their small village and,\
  \ instead, are choosing to stay and preserve their land. In this way, Nordine explained\
  \ how the cooperative has changed the idea of migration. Rather than small-town\
  \ people moving to big cities in search of opportunity, Irzaine is now attracting\
  \ many people from Oujda City and surrounding larger towns with work opportunities.\
  \ After all, the cooperative needs the support of willing workers\u2014Nordine looks\
  \ forward to planting almond trees on the remaining 1,000 hectares of available\
  \ land. \n\nThese additional consequential benefits of his cooperative are meaningful\
  \ to Nordine as its creation came from his passion for development work and to help\
  \ people. He aims to support his community to the best of his ability and, through\
  \ this initiative, has found many ways in which to do so. For example, he provides\
  \ almond trees to people who own less than five hectares of land so that they can\
  \ plant the trees on their land and reap the economic benefits. He also teaches\
  \ them about cooperatives by sharing knowledge he acquired through attending trainings,\
  \ and offers them to become a member of his cooperative.\n\nNordine finds cooperative-building\
  \ so fulfilling and beneficial in both the short- and long-term that he is already\
  \ planning his next endeavor. Noticing a need for women involvement in the community,\
  \ he is interested in helping establish a women\u2019s cooperative in Irzaine. Nordine\
  \ also recognizes, however, that there is a grave need for literacy courses\u2014\
  for which he has already found 18 interested women. It is clear that Nordine\u2019\
  s generosity and passion for development work started long before he returned to\
  \ Irzaine after university. It was a pleasure spending our morning with him and\
  \ learning about his work, his journey on making his goals a reality, and his enthusiasm\
  \ for sharing his knowledge to help others do the same."
