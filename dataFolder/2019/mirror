Text: "When you feel lonely, you are not alone.\n\nLooking in the mirror, staring\
  \ at reflection, a sense of loneliness and uneasiness grew. I decided to have a\
  \ journey to somewhere I had wanted to go for quite some time. Vasuki tal (Uttarakhand)\
  \ via Kedarnath.\n\nIt was a winding drive, looping up the Himalayas. Expansive\
  \ views of surrounding areas covered with tall, pointed Deodars at one side and\
  \ Ganges flowing on other. Bus ride spanning over 10+ hrs took me right through\
  \ city traffic and onto the abode of Himalayas. Last stop was Sonprayag. From there,\
  \ it was a short jeep ride to the base of Kedarnath.\n\nTrek in itself was a mild\
  \ hike through meadows. Alongside, I saw people riding on mules and few with basket\
  \ on their back carrying old people. Very few were walking, mostly because I was\
  \ starting up very late at about 11 AM. Amidst the sound of the flowing river and\
  \ chirping of birds, I continued my ascent. Somewhere in middle, it turned into\
  \ a steep climb snaking to the top with a nature\u2019s bridge connecting it to\
  \ other mountain. I had no one in sight by now on either side, with fast winds blowing\
  \ and temperature dropping rapidly. Several miles ahead there was a group of 20-30\
  \ people, who were carrying a transformer upto Kedarnath. There was no electricity\
  \ in Kedarnath due to issues with old one. I walked few meters alongside them, took\
  \ some information regarding situation in kedarnath and continued ahead. By now\
  \ some light drizzle had started, so I hurried since it was close.\n\nLight drizzle\
  \ created a dense fog around and it was hard to look past it. It was all a dreamscape\
  \ at this point. Walking ahead, there were some camps with people around and that\
  \ was my cue. I have finally reached kedarnath. I asked around and arranged for\
  \ lodging. Freshened up, had some food. Attended evening prayers in temple, talked\
  \ to locals and took in all i could amidst no electricity and thick fog.\n\nI gathered\
  \ from locals that up there, in vasuki tal, sunrise was 5 AM and by about 9:30 AM\
  \ it gets covered in a dense fog. If I don\u2019t manage to start my descent before\
  \ fog starts to set in, it could get very risky. There have been cases of missing\
  \ people almost every year up top. \n\nFew suggested guides but several told me\
  \ to do it by myself as a guide tends to make excuses and may bring me back from\
  \ halfway. Few even told me the way, pointing towards one of the peaks.\u201D Climb\
  \ that one and you would see another peak right behind it with a winding path to\
  \ top. Reach to the top of that one to see another peak which is going be a steep\
  \ climb. On climbing it there will be another one which is again a winding pathway.\
  \ On reaching atop of that you will have to go down. There will be a large crater\
  \ like area with volcanic black rocky hard surface. Follow that path for 2km and\
  \ you will reach vasuki tal \u201C. \n\nNext morning I was up early and was feeling\
  \ fairly confident to do it by myself. I picked some essentials and was on my way\
  \ by 5:30. Followed the path I was told. In about 3 hrs going through rocky path,\
  \ steep climb and slippery climb, due to dew on grass, I finally reached on top\
  \ of last peak. Standing there I wondered about the loneliness I was feeling back\
  \ in the city. To fight it away, here I was standing in a place where there was\
  \ no one. Holding on to the thought I continued my descent from peak towards Vasuki\
  \ tal. \n\nIt took me about 15 minutes to finally reach the Tal. It was surrounded\
  \ by the elusive Brahmakamal(rare variety of lotus) on all sides. Air was filled\
  \ with an aroma that would tickle your senses. Water was at such an eerie calmness\
  \ that one could mistake it for glass. And here I was standing on the sidelines,\
  \ staring at my own reflection."
