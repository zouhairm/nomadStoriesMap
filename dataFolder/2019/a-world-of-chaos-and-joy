Text: "I walk into a room of chaos. Strobe lighting, arguing, drinks are being thrown,\
  \ and in an attempt to hear each other over the noise, there is a lot of yelling.\
  \  On one side of the room there is someone vomiting. On the other side, a girl\
  \ is crying. No, I haven\u2019t just entered a club but a kindergarten, full of\
  \ three year olds.  \n\nLocated in a disadvantaged neighbourhood of Buenos Aires,\
  \ I find myself on a continent that I\u2019ve never travelled to before. Let alone\
  \ speak the language. I\u2019m also pretty useless with kids. When I decided to\
  \ quit my desk job to travel and try something new, this seemed like such a good\
  \ idea.  What have I gotten myself into?  \n\nIt\u2019s my first day and with a\
  \ deep breath and a wide smile, I reach my hand out to the head teacher. I introduce\
  \ myself using the one line of Spanish I know. She reassures me that the kids don\u2019\
  t care what language I speak, they\u2019ll just see a new person who is there to\
  \ care for them, play with them and hug them. After a short and confusing exchange\
  \ of broken Spanish, English and charades, I\u2019m thrown into the day.  \n\nOk,\
  \ I think to myself, first things first, breakfast time. I take the hand of the\
  \ cause of the strobe lighting and lead him back to his seat. Next, I encourage\
  \ another child to eat her breakfast, while asking another child to stop slingshotting\
  \ his porridge, \u201CCome on\" is say out loud, \"it\u2019s not amo amigo\u201D\
  . I feel like I\u2019m stuck inside a hectic game of wack-a-mole and my reflexes\
  \ are getting a workout. Stop this, grab that, move one child, put this child back\
  \ in her seat, shhh, inside voices please. I\u2019m only 20 minutes into my day\
  \ and in an understaffed kindergarten with 17 kids to look after, I already feel\
  \ like I need a break!\n\nArgentina is a passionate country filled with music and\
  \ sass. Unfortunately the economy is struggling and too many people are in poverty.\
  \ As the day goes on, I discover it\u2019s a miracle the children have a safe place\
  \ to come during the day. While mums, dads and guardians are trying to make ends\
  \ meet, for just a few hours a day, they come here. They come here, to the half-finished\
  \ concrete shell of a building, with its alternating hot pink and colbat blue walls,\
  \ leaking taps, blindingly yellow furniture and broken toys. And my job, is to create\
  \ a bubble. A bubble, away from reality, where kids can be kids.  \n\nI can hear\
  \ Latin pop playing in the adjacent activity room. I grab Sophia\u2019s chunky little\
  \ hand and we start dancing. Her mane of dark curls bobbing to the music, eyes wide\
  \ with excitement. We swing arms, jump around and twirl until we both feel sick.\
  \ We keep going, never once letting go of each other. Marc Antony has barely had\
  \ time to reach the second song, when our little circle of two has grown to three,\
  \ four, then five with Carlos, Fernando and Rocio joining the circle. The smiles\
  \ and laughter are infectious. The dancing circle multiplies again. Who needs the\
  \ gym when you can just dance and jump with three year olds. We dance without a\
  \ care in the world, teaching each other dance moves and only stopping when it's\
  \ time to move onto other activities, then lunch and finally an afternoon slumber.\
  \  \n\nThe children asleep, I slip out onto the street, leaving them in the care\
  \ of the head teacher. At the end of my first day, I make my way quickly to the\
  \ bus stop, stepping over the rubble of a crumbling neighbourhood that is boarding\
  \ the line of survival. The day has permeated it\u2019s way into my clothing. I\u2019\
  m covered in finger paint, porridge, snot and glue. And you know what? I don\u2019\
  t care. My heart is bursting and I can\u2019t wipe the smile off my face. This foreigner\
  \ is no longer a stranger. She is a friend who can\u2019t wait to make the journey\
  \ back to the pink and blue oasis tomorrow."
