Text: "Undoubtedly, the hasty departure that ensued following their uptown London\
  \ accommodation checkout was due to the underwhelming experience they\u2019d encountered\
  \ over the past six nights. In a truly masterful embellishment, Claire reflected\
  \ of the advertisement she\u2019d read about the place that her and James had just\
  \ sojourned in. Their room proved to be an unstylish, mediocre studio befitting\
  \ of all necessities though lacking all the charm she had grew to expect on the\
  \ first leg of their first trip overseas together. The unforgiving chill of London\
  \ in November was indeed an adjustment for her in spite of James\u2019 unyielding\
  \ love for winter, and indeed a hindrance on her overall enjoyment \u2013 the typical\
  \ Australian warm blood. \nChasing romantic histories, it wasn\u2019t long before\
  \ Claire and James were on their way to the destination of Shakespeare\u2019s birth\
  \ and resting place typed into the GPS. Stratford was not at all far, though the\
  \ road conditions were icy, and with minimal daylight hours in the winter months,\
  \ a short time to get there. Claire looked appreciatively at the always smiling\
  \ James \u2013 \u2018such a patient man\u2019, she thought. The romance and inspirational\
  \ appeal Claire had anticipated once again left a lot to be desired; blatant opportunistic\
  \ businesses, cheapening the authenticity of the historical aspects of the city\
  \ disappointed and jaded Claire\u2019s expectations for travel plans for the future.\
  \ \nIt was a short drive to their accommodation for the night; The Green Dragon\
  \ Inn. Booked only that day over lunch in Stratford, there was nowhere else available\
  \ - it didn\u2019t matter, they were leaving first thing. Upon arrival, the Inn\
  \ could\u2019ve gone undetected if you hadn\u2019t been looking for it, Claire thought.\
  \ It was a plain, white bricked, two-story building with promising smoke billowing\
  \ out of its two chimneys. Greeted after knocking for what seemed like an eternity\
  \ in the evening chill, a disgruntled, elderly woman with an expression that looked\
  \ like she\u2019d just eaten something unpleasant answered the door. \u201CWe\u2019\
  re full\u201D she barked impatiently. \n\u201CI think you may be expecting us?\u201D\
  \ James smiled kindly. \nThe door swung open and they each bustled their bags into\
  \ the entrance as abruptly instructed. It was via no exaggeration the pitiful reviews\
  \ online that Claire understood that a simple toe out of line with such an eccentric\
  \ hostess would grant them a horrible experience. \n\u201CThey\u2019re Aussie\u2019\
  s, they\u2019ll want a beer\u201D she barked at whom only could have been her son\
  \ behind the bar. \u2018It\u2019s one night, only one night\u2019 Claire chanted\
  \ in her mind.\n\u201CAlright?\u201D he asked with a patient smile. Both Claire\
  \ and James smiled politely, \u201CMake yourselves at home\u201D he encouraged.\n\
  They each swiftly took a seat near the beautiful fireplace, it radiated such welcoming\
  \ heat, licking Claire\u2019s frosted cheeks, giving her what felt like an instant\
  \ glow. She nestled into the antique armchair and observed her surroundings. The\
  \ crooked pine Christmas tree erected in the far corner instantly caught her attention.\
  \ The carefully, yet imperfectly wrapped gifts that sat underneath it and the soft,\
  \ warm glowing lights complemented the damaged, mismatching ornaments that were\
  \ scattered among its branches. An elder gentleman that the bar tender had called\
  \ John was onto his second lager, occasionally bending forward to comfort his equally\
  \ elderly terrier, Molly. \n\u201CYou\u2019ve arrived on quite the night\u201D John\
  \ chuckled, \u201CRose is having her annual festive event\u201D. \nRose returned\
  \ and descended the flight of stairs carefully, now wearing a dress that was black,\
  \ long and ill-fitting. Her attention to detail on her matching festive accessories\
  \ made Claire smile endearingly. She continued her shuffle over to John and gave\
  \ him an affectionate kiss on his forehead, a smile forming in the corners of her\
  \ mouth. \nThe couple shared and unspoken tender moment before Rose moved toward\
  \ the entrance and began meeting her equally fashionable friends who had just arrived.\
  \  A lump in Claire\u2019s throat formed at the unexpected charm and authenticity\
  \ within such an unanticipated part of their trip. \nIt wasn\u2019t until their\
  \ third night that Molly was comfortably nestled on Claire\u2019s lap \u2013 stroking\
  \ her ears gently as John watched on as Rose animatedly shared their adventures\
  \ in front of the comfort of the homey fireplace, much to the delight of the young\
  \ Australian travellers."
