Text: "We're standing in yet another airport queue, the 3rd of the hour. \n\nWe hear\
  \ a little Irish voice behind us asking if it\u2019s the right queue. And we start\
  \ chatting.\n\n\u201CHow do you like Sri Lanka?\u201D she asks.\n\nA loaded question\
  \ I quickly learn, as she moves onto all the points she hates: the trains, the dirt,\
  \ the noise, the bargaining, the traffic, the transport\u2013 the list goes on.\n\
  \nAs she drones on, I drift into a moment of reflection.\n\nI feel that Colombo\
  \ has brought us back to life.\n\nOur life in Dubai is monochrome: The people wear\
  \ black or white; the sand is white; the buildings are white, everything manufactured.\n\
  \nColombo is a different world.\n\nStep off the plane and you are immediately engulfed\
  \ in thick, humid air and big smiles.\n\nEnter the terminal, wade through the crowds\
  \ of stores selling everything from guitars to washing machines and you emerge again\
  \ into the hot, oppressive night.\n\nI try to describe the smell - it\u2019s a cross\
  \ between burning rubbish and hot baked cement with the odd waft of tropical flowers.\n\
  \nA complete sensory overload. And it\u2019s simply magnificent.\n\nAs we drive,\
  \ we are engulfed in the noise and traffic that defines this city. Tuk tuks everywhere,\
  \ all vying for their own patch of road.  I see my life flash before my eyes on\
  \ multiple occasions: The truck that clears the edge of our car by millimetres;\
  \ the mother and child we almost run over; the four-lane-change done with no indicating\
  \ and no space.\n\nBut somehow, it works.\n\nAnd its life in technicolour.\n\nThe\
  \ women, with their long, black shiny hair look like they try to out-do each other\
  \ with who has a more beautiful sari. Everywhere you look you see flashing threads\
  \ of gold and silver and every colour of the rainbow. \n\nThe tuk tuks are all unique\
  \ in decor and style. The road looks lively and engaging, even though you take your\
  \ lives into your own hands to cross it! \nThe streets are lined with trees and\
  \ flowers as much as with rubbish and shops. \n\nThe sensory overload continues\
  \ throughout - the food is spicy, the air is hot and muggy, the storms intense.\n\
  \nThe best way I can describe Sri Lanka is that it IS life. It doesn\u2019t pretend\
  \ to be anything it\u2019s not.\n\nIt\u2019s too hot to wear makeup. It\u2019s too\
  \ muggy to think about wearing anything but cotton. There\u2019s no point trying\
  \ to blowdry your hair because it\u2019s frizzy again in seconds.\n\nThere is no\
  \ pretence.\n\nAs we drive along the potholded roads going south, clay huts and\
  \ thatched roofed cottages line the road. \nThe beautiful school kids with their\
  \ perfect dark skin and shining white teeth smile and wave each dressed in an immaculate\
  \ white uniform which stands out against the red earth.\n\nEven the ocean has a\
  \ special energy and life.\n\nRips are all the way along the beach. The currents\
  \ are hard to stand up in, which makes for a good workout! And as you wander along\
  \ the water\u2019s edge, there are crabs dancing around your toes and dashing in\
  \ and out of the water.\n\nBut the best is the afternoon storms.\n\nAs we lay in\
  \ the pool we see the clouds forming on the horizon. Within a couple of hours the\
  \ humidity reaches a fever pitch and black thunderhead clouds have marched steadily\
  \ across the sky.\n\nThe first lightening bolt brings a squeals from the kids before\
  \ the downpour starts.\n\nBig, fat rain that completely drenches every patch of\
  \ space forms rivers on the thick buffalo grass surrounding the footpaths. The fresh\
  \ smell of the rain sweeps through and as quickly as it starts, the storm has moved\
  \ on and we\u2019re left with the tropical sunset of red, orange and pink that floods\
  \ the sky with light and gives everything a golden hue.\n\nWhat's to complain about?\n\
  \nI hear a guards voice - I\u2019m back in the airport.\n\nI can still hear the\
  \ Irish lady moaning about the dirty streets. \n\nI smile politely and say \u201C\
  best get back to Dublin then love.\u201D\n\nI\u2019m sure I saw the security guard\
  \ crack the briefest of smiles as he waved us on\u2026"
