Text: "Everything begun with a primary English teacher in vacation, me, wanting to\
  \ reconnect with a dear friend and her family. And what a better place to visit\
  \ then Canary Islands? The unknown beauty of this island it's been soon revealed\
  \ to my eyes. The stunning experience couldn't have been the same without the warmth\
  \ and fizzy people I found in the neighborhood, that soon become a good net of local\
  \ supportive people ready to give their food, drinks, happiness and \"sangre caliente\"\
  \ to me. I felt in love with the place, so friendly and loving that I decided to\
  \ came back for a home made full immersion and stayed there for about 6 moths, learning\
  \ the language and sharing food and experiences at night with my roommates from\
  \ other islands of the \"archipi\xE9lago\". It's always time to have a party on\
  \ the porch or a \"parrillada\" in the garden there. Nieve, my friend/neighbour's\
  \ mum is been a lovely and proud woman who thought me how to appreciate at full\
  \ the beauties of the place and \"disfrutarlas como si siempre tuvieran tuyas\"\
  . I'm now refreshed and ready for a new adventure but they always will be in my\
  \ heart! I discovered the power of the lavic stone, connecting us to the very center\
  \ of the earth and of a little exercise and meditation time for myself.. Last but\
  \ not least."
