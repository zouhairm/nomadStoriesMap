Text: "I\u2019m lying beneath a hedge, quietly sobbing. My heart beats so hard that\
  \ I fear the inside of my chest will bruise, but what I fear more is that he will\
  \ find me. \n\nI fear the sound of soft footfalls and crunching stones that will\
  \ tell me that he\u2019s tracked me to my hiding place. I fear the charged pause\
  \ before his hand grips my hair and pulls me up. My screams might reach the nearest\
  \ house, but it is empty; its windows are boarded and grass spews from its chimney.\
  \ Up on this lonely hillside, no one will hear my cries for help. \n\nAn hour ago,\
  \ I was at the bottom of the hill. Brinkie\u2019s Brae rises above the quaint seaside\
  \ town of Stromness. Like most Scottish hills it\u2019s devoid of trees, and without\
  \ trees for scale its size is deceptive. \n\nIt\u2019s my first day off from my\
  \ volunteer work on the island. The sun is blazing in a rare blue sky and a northwesterly\
  \ wind cools the back of my neck. It\u2019s a perfect day to see the view from the\
  \ top of the hill. Camera poised, I start to climb.\n\nIt\u2019s a quiet and peaceful\
  \ walk. I snap pictures of the view as it changes. I pause to watch an enormous\
  \ seabird catch a crab between rocks in the bay far below. When I\u2019m halfway\
  \ up the hill, I stop to rest and munch on a muesli bar. It\u2019s when I turn to\
  \ tuck the wrapper into my backpack that I notice the man on the path behind me.\n\
  \nI think he\u2019s far away, but like the treeless hills of Scotland, his distance\
  \ and size are deceptive. He\u2019s close enough to make eye contact with me but\
  \ he keeps his gaze averted. His rust coloured beard hides the line of his mouth.\
  \ He\u2019s carrying a heavy, oddly shaped bag.   \n\nMy heart skips a beat and\
  \ then flutters in panic. My mind leaps to the countless news reports of women who\
  \ \u201Cfoolishly\u201D walked alone and \u201Cirresponsibly\u201D got themselves\
  \ murdered. \n\nI try to act nonchalant. I zip up my bag and start to walk again.\
  \ My pace is brisk now, more determined. My stride is as wide as my small legs can\
  \ stretch. I hold my chin high.\n\nSurreptitiously, I glance over my shoulder. The\
  \ man is jogging now, closing the distance between us. There is nobody else on the\
  \ path but us. There is nothing at the top of the hill except a view. The outline\
  \ of the object in his bag looks like a sledgehammer. \n\nI run. \n\nThere are low\
  \ stone walls and hedges on either side of the path. I dart past a small tin shed,\
  \ drop over a wall, and slide on my belly beneath a hedge. The gravel grazes my\
  \ palms and my knee aches from the awkward angle that it\u2019s bent, but I dare\
  \ not move. \n\nI cried as I waited for him to find me, but nothing ever happened.\
  \ The man must have turned down another path, probably taking his bag of tools back\
  \ to his farm and thinking nothing else of me, and there I lay for nearly half an\
  \ hour, too scared to move. \n\nMy fingernails clawed the dirt as my fear turned\
  \ into seething anger. Anger that that man can walk around in broad daylight in\
  \ a quiet area with little concern and I can\u2019t. Anger from knowing that if\
  \ I had of been attacked, society would first ask why I chose to walk alone in that\
  \ area, rather than ask why the man chose to act violently. My face burned as I\
  \ started to question whether I overreacted, and after fifteen minutes, I acknowledged\
  \ that I was no longer afraid but was still hiding beneath the bush because I was\
  \ ashamed with my reaction. \n\nEventually the shamed ebbed away and in its place\
  \ came embarrassed laughter. I lay there a while longer, head on my hands, watching\
  \ the colourful fishing boats scudding around Hamnavoe bay. It really was a beautiful\
  \ view."
