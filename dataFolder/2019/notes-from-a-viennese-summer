Text: "I dreamed of Vienna for years, ever since I was six and my father, knowing\
  \ my penchant for stories about princes and princesses, brought home tapes of the\
  \ classic movies with Romy Schneider playing Princess Sissi. I was hooked. I loved\
  \ everything about her: her beauty, her long hair, her love story with Emperor Franz\
  \ Joseph. I wanted to be her. I wanted to wear a white dress and have a handsome\
  \ prince offer me flowers during the cotillion, then dance in his arms till morning.\
  \ The fantasy somewhat faded as I grew older but still I knew that someday I was\
  \ going to see where she had lived. \n\nDream notwithstanding, it was hard deciding\
  \ to go to Vienna instead of Munich that summer. I have always been a creature of\
  \ habit and although going to Vienna had always been on my travel wish list since\
  \ that faraway summer when I wore out those old tapes, I knew Munich. I knew the\
  \ shops, the streets, the restaurants. Vienna was the dream, but it was also the\
  \ unknown and I\u2019d stopped being one for adventures long before I had to choose\
  \ where to go that summer.\n\nStill, I packed my bags and left. It was a hot day\
  \ at the end of July and the train ride was \u2013 as per Italian tradition \u2013\
  \ terrible. The air conditioning system didn\u2019t work. I should have known, of\
  \ course \u2013 it never does. And in the rare cases in which it is on, it is set\
  \ at a temperature that would make penguins shiver, their beaks chattering from\
  \ the cold. This was not the case that day: the day I left for Vienna the AC was\
  \ off, and with the sun beating down on the steel structure of the train at a temperature\
  \ close to 40\xB0C, the coach turned into an oven. Needless to say, my disposition\
  \ was not improved by the heat. Impatient and tired, it was a good thing I was traveling\
  \ alone.\n\nI arrived in Vienna\u2019s Westbahnhof early in the afternoon. I didn\u2019\
  t really have time to look around, caught as I was in trying to juggle my luggage,\
  \ find the right exit \u2013 not an easy feat when you don\u2019t know the language\
  \ \u2013 and beware of possible pickpockets, all while trying not to kill someone\
  \ with my \u2018wardrobe on wheels\u2019 (I\u2019m not one to pack light). Finally\
  \ I managed to find a taxi, pushed my belongings in the trunk, and set off towards\
  \ the student house where I\u2019d booked a room. And finally I had a look at the\
  \ city, just to be terribly disappointed.\n\nThey say that no dream ever lives up\
  \ to reality; I found it to be true. I had envisioned a glorious city, capital of\
  \ an empire, with large, clean streets, palaces glinting in the sunlight, elegance\
  \ and a feeling of royalty. I had envisioned the Vienna Empress Sissi had lived\
  \ in, but I had not taken into account the 100-year gulf between us. What I found\
  \ instead was a city that had lost its former glory, capital of a country that was\
  \ no longer the rich empire it used to be. The grand streets and palaces were there,\
  \ but the people were far from friendly, the roads were littered with papers and\
  \ cigarette butts, and the walls were covered in graffiti. \n\nIt\u2019s hard to\
  \ let go of a dream."
