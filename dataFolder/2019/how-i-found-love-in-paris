Text: "It\u2019s January 2018 I meet a girl through an online connection that lived\
  \ in Paris at the time. Our connection immediately sparks, we spend hours every\
  \ night talking and laughing. I feel this sense of adventure everytime I talk to\
  \ her, I think she\u2019s just a friend but I need to see her with my eyes. I\u2019\
  ve never been outside of North America, my parents have always told me everywhere\u2019\
  s but NA is dangerous. I\u2019m scared but my young heart is full of adventure I\
  \ have to go, so I buy a ticket secretly for April... fast forward to April I eventually\
  \ tell my parents they\u2019re scared but they let me go with no problems. I feeling\
  \ I got when I was flying over the ocean for the first time, about to see a beautiful\
  \ city that a year ago I would have said I would never go to, about to meet a girl\
  \ that changed my mind on travel. We land and immediately the nerves and fear strike\
  \ me \u201CWoah I\u2019m in Paris\u201D I don\u2019t know what to do. I leave the\
  \ plane and board a train shortly after I\u2019ll never forget seeing the words\
  \ \u201CRER\u201D I knew once I got the train my life would forever change, that\
  \ my sense of adventure would forever go stronger and stronger. I jumped on and\
  \ sat on the train nervous as hell. I had a giant Canadian flag on my backpack and\
  \ next thing I knew 2 Canadian guys came and sat by me \u201Cso what part of canada\
  \ are you from?\u201D It sparked a conversation that forever changed me. I realized\
  \ that Europe is an amazing place to travel to. The way people can connect in short\
  \ amount of time here all with one thing in common being a traveler. I talked with\
  \ them the rest of the ride (30 mins) until I got off in Garde du Nord and it fully\
  \ hit me I\u2019m in France across the ocean!! I pulled up my map I had to make\
  \ sure it was real haha. It\u2019s end of April in Paris when I walked outside the\
  \ station I felt the warm spring air. So silky and smooth I looked down the European\
  \ street, realizing how amazing this place really is. \u201CI\u2019m in a place\
  \ with a completely different culture so different but I feel so comfortable\u201D\
  \ I said out loud. I looked at my watch realizing I had to meet the girl soon at\
  \ our hostel I rushed to the hostel checked in. Did my hair up and went downstairs\
  \ to meet her..... then I saw her and let me tell you the way she looked with her\
  \ red shirt and blue jeans, with her hair blowing in the silky air. She was incredible.\
  \ We were both so Nervous at the beginning we never had met, still so oblivious\
  \ to what was going to come. (I had no idea I liked her) we walked around for hours\
  \ getting lost in the Paris streets I was so shocked by the place around me but\
  \ yet my eyes were focused on her. We ate kiwis and croissants let me tell you a\
  \ Canadian croissant is no match haha. It was getting close to sunset as we headed\
  \ to the Louvre we arrived at the perfect time. I saw the bright red sky slowly\
  \  grow darker behind the Louvre, it was truly the most beautiful thing I had ever\
  \ seen. I was so happy I looked at the girl we kept walking about 15 mins later\
  \ I saw it, i saw the effiel tower. So bright in the night sky it was the moment\
  \ I truly realized where I was, who I was with. This was the most eye opening moment\
  \ of my life. We went to get wine at a store then headed to Montmartre. Climbed\
  \ the hill and proceeded to drink till the stars came out. I loved Paris but I realized\
  \ that I had mostly been looking at her the entire time. My hand reached to her..\
  \ she let me feel her heart beat.. she felt mine. What I said next changed our lives\
  \ forever.\n\u201CI think I like you\u201D"
