Text: "Become a tourist in your own city and you'll always find something; what's\
  \ interesting about the phrase is that it insinuates that one is supposed to automatically\
  \ discover something finite, a concept that could be grasped by the human mind,\
  \ be it love, adventure, or some obvious thing that most would think of first. This\
  \ isn't a story that breaks too far from the clich\xE9 but it is neither the same\
  \ as every other story. For a period of seven months, I worked in a Popsicle shop\
  \ in Ybor City, a city which is known for its nightlife and many eccentrics. I knew\
  \ of big-name spots for locals like Hillsborough community college, 7th avenue (known\
  \ as \"the strip\" to locals), and Muvico just to name a few. Although I could easily\
  \ explain where to find good food for a low price or where to have fun or even get\
  \ some work done depending on who was asking, I was in Ybor city purely to work\
  \ and do nothing more, so I only cared to memorize those type of spots, places for\
  \ tourist to go when bored or curious and something to talk with regulars and locals\
  \ about when something or nothing is going on. I remember back in November it was\
  \ a day off for me and my last week working in Ybor; I had decided to stop by a\
  \ coffee shop that I have found myself to be quite fond of named \"The Bricks\"\
  \ and it had an aesthetic that suggested \"Seattle but in Tampa\". I ordered my\
  \ usual drink, but instead of taking my drink to go like I usually do, I decide\
  \ to sit inside this time and just enjoy the atmosphere. While I was sitting a friend\
  \ of mine had come in. I had decided to go up to this friend to say hi and we talked\
  \ for just a little under 10 minutes and in our small conversation. We begin talking\
  \ about the trolly cart that goes from Ybor to the downtown area, I told him that\
  \ I have never ridden the trolly, to which he exaggerates \"You've never ridden\
  \ the trolly? dude, you've gotta ride it, it's free today\". After he left I decided\
  \ to take his word and hop on the trolly. Although I have been to the downtown area\
  \ before I haven't traveled between where Ybor and downtown connect. I walk to a\
  \ nearby trolly stop and sit for about five minutes before the cart arrived. When\
  \ the trolly had come I took a seat in what I thought was the back row, to my amazement\
  \ and shock the seats were reversible instead of back-to-back. As the trolly moved,\
  \ I gazed at the sky and the surrounding scene as the sun was setting leaving the\
  \ horizon to change between beautiful hues that ranged everywhere between vermillion\
  \ and magenta. As I went through downtown I passed the aquarium, the docks, Amelie\
  \ arena, and so many more places. On my way back I began to notice how the area\
  \ became crowded as the sky shifted from magenta to indigo, except it wasn't a club\
  \ scene like I was used to, I had seen spouses taking goofy touristy photos and\
  \ parents holding their children upon their shoulder, I would see groups of friends\
  \ leaving Hooters and cheering about any random thing worth celebrating. When I\
  \ got back to Ybor, I stopped inside my job to get a popsicle and watch from the\
  \ giant window as people enjoyed the madness of Ybor from its club scene to the\
  \ many eccentric street performers. I took it all in and made conversation and laughed\
  \ with my coworkers about the madness of Ybor, I called myself a Lyft so that I\
  \ could get home quick. When I entered the car and roed in the passenger's seat\
  \ home I was taken aback by how much the area has grown on me and contrary to what\
  \ I had thought, the city earned a special place in my heart and I didn't expect\
  \ to miss it so much, ultimately I felt a sense of bliss for what I have found but\
  \ a sense of longing for what I've given up."
