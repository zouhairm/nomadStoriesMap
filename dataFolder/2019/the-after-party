Text: "When the Program placed me in a small town, north of the Stara Planina, called\
  \ Montana, I was disappointed, having hoped for a Bulgarian town that was somehow\
  \ more Bulgarian. Then I arrived, and marveled at its novelty. Then the novelty\
  \ waned, as it so often did, leaving me with a tower of dirty dishes; multiple jars\
  \ of moldy lutenitsa; and a herpetic cat that, on a whim, I had lured off the streets.\
  \ \n\nBut what is one to do with a herpetic cat? \n\nWhat is one to do with blown\
  \ fuses, or shirts that dry into cardboard, or a water heater that is dependable\
  \ only in its undependability, flitting between the dual extremes of boiling and\
  \ biting? These were the pressing questions of travel, unbeknownst to the authors\
  \ of my Bulgarian phrasebook. For weeks, too embarrassed to ask for help, I took\
  \ combat showers by the light of my iPhone, willing myself to believe that, as an\
  \ aspiring writer, I\u2019d hit the jackpot. It was not until the cat\u2019s eye\
  \ had turned a wrathful pink that I finally cracked, and called my 11th grader,\
  \ Evgeni. \n\nOne perk of living in small town Bulgaria is the ability to call Evgeni.\
  \ It depends somewhat on the town, but having dinner at a student\u2019s house or\
  \ getting coffee after school is normal. This was a shock, at first, and with some\
  \ teachers merits psychoanalysis, but ultimately rewarding. Due partly to the structure\
  \ of classes -- a class stays with its primary teacher from the 8th to 12th grades\
  \ -- and partly to the lack of stability at home -- many students live alone while\
  \ their parents work abroad, in Germany or the UK, sending money back -- a teacher\
  \ is not merely an educator, but a mentor and friend. So you learn how the other\
  \ side lives. I did not have this in America until college.\n\nIt was students who\
  \ introduced me to Montana. When I had emerged from the creaky Soviet marshrutka,\
  \ sticky from travel, they were waiting at the station, ready to drag my things\
  \ through potholes and fissured cobblestone to the fourth floor of my Khrushchyovka\
  \ building. It was students who revealed that the town bore no relation to the flyover\
  \ state, instead deriving its name from a Roman military camp, the vestiges of which\
  \ remain in the form of a crumbling fortress overlooking the second largest reservoir\
  \ in the Balkans -- the apex of any meaty local tour. And it was with students,\
  \ who had invited themselves to my apartment one evening for board games and cookies\
  \  -- \u201CDon\u2019t worry, the last American let us in!\u201D -- that I learned\
  \ my portable oven was not broken, merely German. The tiny plastic dials and switches\
  \ had to be activated in a specific order, with a specific amount of force, like\
  \ a secret code. A code that they labored to teach me when our English lessons morphed,\
  \ inevitably, into Bulgarian swears and memes. \"Kruv povrushtam, pari nevrushtam,\"\
  \ I would repeat, carefully rolling each R. \"I might be vomiting blood, but you\u2019\
  re not getting your money back.\" \n\nIn other words, keep at it. \n\nEasier said\
  \ than done, however, when the audience was not a student, but the disapproving\
  \ veterinarian. When Evgeni asked why I had not called sooner, I replied that I\
  \ didn\u2019t want to be found out. He shook his head, charitably. Evgeni was the\
  \ linguistic savant to my village idiot. At the Foreign Language High School, students\
  \ each study three languages, with plans to one day escape their little outpost\
  \ of capitalism. Evgeni wanted to move to Hollywood, to become an actor. Where I\
  \ saw whimsy in Montana\u2019s traveling movie theater -- folding chairs in the\
  \ gym that, depending on the month, also housed the traveling dance troupe or traveling\
  \ reptile exhibit -- he saw room for improvement. So he studied, and dreamed, and\
  \ forced himself to speak English with the native speaker. \n\nAs embarrassing as\
  \ it is to fumble over words, it is more embarrassing to have your language student\
  \ show you up.  \"Kruv povrushtam, pari nevrushtam,\" I told myself. The cat was\
  \ yowling. So Evgeni, fluent also in cat-speak, shushed it, dropped it in a cardboard\
  \ box, and led us out the door."
