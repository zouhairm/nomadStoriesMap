Text: "Growing up Kumbh was a cliche for me. I have roots in both Allahabad, and Banaras.\
  \ And if you were to speak of a cowbelt-er, well, I am it! The Kumbh is pervasive\
  \ in our life and a constancy in our culture. To give you an idea of how close we\
  \ are to it, the name Kumbh Mela is too formal for our household - for us it is\
  \ Kumbh, just Kumbh. \u2018Hum Kumbh nahane gaye the\u2019, literally, \u2018I\u2019\
  d gone to bathe in the Kumbh\u2019, is how you would hear one of us talk. \n\nOver\
  \ the last 18 months I have found in me a new urge, which compels me to experience\
  \ the world and its events far more deeply. So the Kumbh Mela wasn\u2019t one I\
  \ was going to miss. I am also a city slicker and so I was dying to know what this\
  \ hype was about. At the risk of sounding cliched, I am not particularly religious,\
  \ so that was definitely not the driving force. And despite all the sins I have\
  \ committed, I wasn\u2019t looking to wash any of them away either. That said, little\
  \ did I know what was in store for me. \n\nA little about Kumbh: It is believed\
  \ that a dip in the holy river cleanses one's sins. The river of the city where\
  \ the Kumbh is held, is believed to turn into amrit during the Kumbh, allowing devotees\
  \ to bathe in its pureness and immortality. As per Hindu mythology the Kumbh is\
  \ the pot that was used by the Gods and the Asuras to collect the amrit during the\
  \ churning of the Cosmic Ocean. During the churning a few drops of amrit fell to\
  \ earth in four places. These are the places that now host the Kumbh. \n\nKumbh\
  \ had a celebratory air that drew me in even before I stepped foot in Prayagraj.\
  \ On the morning of the snan, or the dip, I remember the utter quietude that belied\
  \ the glorious chaos that was about to unfold. Within a few moments of sunrise the\
  \ Triveni Sangam was speckled with colours that no palette could imagine. From the\
  \ chiming of the mantra of \u2018Har Har Mahadev\u2019 being sung in praise of Lord\
  \ Shiva, to the raucous screams of the boatmen, who were gathered in their hundreds,\
  \ nearly causing a traffic jam on the holy river...how quintessentially Indian it\
  \ all was! My favourite memory is trying to get to the Sangam by hopping over more\
  \ boats than I cared to count. \n\nFinally it was the moment of reckoning. Being\
  \ hydrophobic and claustrophobic, it was not my most courageous moment. To add to\
  \ that the water was so cold, it felt like it seeped through my flesh and froze\
  \ my bones. But this was a fraction of a second. From not wanting to take a dip,\
  \ to the moment of joining hands that formed a human chain and taking umpteen dips\
  \ (one dip for each prayer), the moment was almost surreal. And guess what, I had\
  \ conquered my phobia, if only momentarily! \n\nEveryday that I was here was a new\
  \ experience. Watching the sun rise and set over the sea of hundreds and thousands\
  \ of tents that were famously called the \u2018tent city\u2019, to watching little\
  \ things like yogis hanging upside down off tree branches, to seeing the migratory\
  \ birds that gather up the river and surprisingly have an appetite for the local\
  \ savouries (read: good old Indian deep fried gathia).  \n\nIn the words of author\
  \ and columnist Gautam Chikermane, \n\u201CNot rituals \u2014 Kumbh gave me a window\
  \ to look at the vastness of India, its people, it\u2019s Oneness.\nNot rides \u2014\
  \ Kumbh gave me eyes to look within, to see the beyond, to become part of the whole,\
  \ merge into our civilisation.\n\nMy discovery:\nYou are Kumbh.\nI am Kumbh.\nWe\
  \ are Kumbh.\u201D\n\nLooking back I feel fortunate that little ol\u2019 me had\
  \ the opportunity to be a part of a larger whole. Reports claim, as many as 50 million\
  \ people participated in the shahi snan on one day! I missed that of course but\
  \ am not surprised that but I\u2019m certain I\u2019ll be back for the next Kumbh.\
  \ It is now a part of me."
