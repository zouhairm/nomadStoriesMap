Text: "When Abdul claimed that he threw the best party in Arugam Bay, we were intrigued.\
  \ Not because we were big fans of the daily late night parties at a different, nondescript\
  \ beach shack in that summery surf town, by any means. It\u2019s just that we were\
  \ more than a little amused by the fact that a petite, jolly, middle-aged Sri Lankan\
  \ Tamil Muslim\nfather of five was stating, with his characteristic bravado, that\
  \ he could outdo them all.\n\nAs an unmarried Indian woman often mistaken for a\
  \ Sri Lankan, travelling around the island with two other unmarried women, I was\
  \ an incongruence.  My access to the standard touristy experiences:\nthrilling views\
  \ of golden-sanded beaches framing a shimmering aquamarine ocean, abundant wildlife,\
  \ ancient cultural relics, and the delicious food, was constantly paralleled by\
  \ a persistent tug of\nawareness inherited from my homeland, that as a brown female\
  \ body in these parts, assumptions were always being made about how I ought to\n\
  behave.\n\nLike most solids bonds, our acquaintance with Abdul was rooted in economic\
  \ co-dependency. His was the only 24-hour eatery in this expensive stretch of the\
  \ east coast lined with surf shops and trendy bay-facing beach shacks, that\noffered\
  \ dirt cheap prices, comparable to those found at local restaurants in the rest\
  \ of the country. We were backpacking on an Indian paycheck. But it was Abdul's\
  \ all-too-familiar, typically South Asian avuncular fussing, well-balanced by his\
  \ habit of sitting down to a coffee and beedi with his regular customers, that we\
  \ took comfort in.\n\n\nSo it was the case that we decided to take his grand declaration\
  \ as an invitation, and one moonless Saturday night, he whisked us off in a tuk\
  \ tuk, through unlit streets, away from the disco lights and EDM pulsating along\
  \ Arugam\nBay. After a few meandering turns in the dark, we had arrived at our mysterious\
  \ party place.\n\nA strong, salty sea breeze billowed through our hair and clothes,\
  \ our phone torchlights illuminating small sections of a beach as we followed Abdul\
  \ and his brother-in-law. We were on a narrow strip of beach flanked by the sea\
  \ to our left and a stream to our right. At a point equidistant from the water bodies,\
  \ we sat down. Abdul poured us\nall arrack drinks.  The sky, dotted with millions\
  \ of stars, seemed to curve over us, pinned down to the black horizons on either\
  \ side.\n\nAbdul would sing and dance whenever he was happy and that night, he sang\
  \ song after Tamil song, his rich baritone somehow clear even in the wind. Maybe\
  \ the emptiness of the landscape prompted them to reminisce the past, because at\
  \ some point, the men began telling us\nabout the years when it was bad. Stories\
  \ from a time of devastation, of loss, where brutality was commonplace and the stillness\
  \ of a perfect day was never to be trusted. Stories of sifting through the debris\
  \ of what was left behind, rebuilding lives.\n\nThe night pressed on, and eventually,\
  \ it was time for us to leave. As we were saying goodbye, Abdul said to me in a\
  \ tired voice, \u201CI never do\nbad to you.\u201D He repeated this emphatically,\
  \ looking upset. I nodded, somewhat puzzled, but felt I understood. He was letting\
  \ me know that\nwe could trust his friendship. Gratitude and something bordering\
  \ fear squeezed at my heart. In a town as small and conservative as this, I wondered\
  \ if people had been gossiping about our friendship.\n\n\nSeveral hours later, we\
  \ stumbled out of a nondescript beach shack with a small group of fellow tourists.\
  \ We were buzzing with alcohol and a\ndesire to continue dancing. Right outside\
  \ the entrance stood Abdul, with a group of men from the area. It seemed they had\
  \ been drinking\ntoo. My brain fuzzily recalled hearing of rules charging locals\
  \ a hefty entry fee; a measure to curb incidents of harassment of female tourists\
  \ by local men. I smiled at him, but the smile he returned was unfocused. I wanted\
  \ to tell him that I liked his party better. But then the shoulders of my mates\
  \ propeled me forward and we are off, in search of a place to dance the\nnight away."
