Text: "Rare that you look back at history with someone from your personal history.\n\
  \nIt started out on a searing Saturday morning with a simple immersion of old Manila,\
  \ starting from Binondo Chinatown. I, my best friend (and ex) and her aunt initially\
  \ planned to visit ancient temples and absorb their meditative atmosphere. But the\
  \ Chinese stopover turn out to be less so, with mung bean mooncakes and apartels\
  \ disguised as Chinese temples.\n\nBut being hungry to relive the experience of\
  \ Spanish-era Manila, we decided on the next destination being the brick-walled\
  \ fortress of Intramuros. The \u201Cbahay na bato\u201D (house of stone) aesthetic\
  \ set up in every corner of every cobbled street was a feast to the eyes that transported\
  \ us to that idyllic period of the country. She would have been happy.\n\nYet of\
  \ all the iconic sights from the walled city, like the rebuilt-prone Manila Cathedral\
  \ and the still-standing Fort Santiago, I randomly uttered to our taxi driver: \"\
  Casa Manila\".\n\nNow, those two words were hearsay from my folks and some Internet\
  \ posts involving prenuptials and art events. It frequently came on browser searches,\
  \ along with other local museums housing Spanish-era antiques. The fa\xE7ade and\
  \ its shell windowpanes had also been a typical exterior shooting location for historical\
  \ movies. It would be no surprise if even its household interior is borrowed as\
  \ a film set, latrine toilets and all.\n\nBut at the moment as we step into the\
  \ paved courtyard, the old Filipino locale hit intimately. Sooner, it became clear:\
  \ Casa Manila was the venue of my parents\u2019 wedding.\n\nIt sparked a firm elation\
  \ in my spirit. My best friend was also delighted about the discovery, especially\
  \ as I recognize every sculpted wall, every granite step, every brick wall and every\
  \ garden ornament present from 1994. I could only thank the VHS tapes of my folks\u2019\
  \ wedding video that I watched when I was at kindergarten, and were still functional\
  \ and restored.\n\nA mental projector helped me recognize how the wedding went in\
  \ that fountain courtyard. There were the cobblestoned steps where the wedding march\
  \ started. There was a lobby stretch where the reception took place. And there was\
  \ the foyer with the ivory arc where my parents exchanged vows. It was all enthralling\
  \ to not only relive local history but your parents\u2019 history.\n\nAnd I experienced\
  \ it with a loving friend whom I hoped for from the past. She was ecstatic to explore\
  \ around the olden piazza and capture every exquisite moment if you exclude the\
  \ trip to the nearby resto as an exquisite moment. The tomato-infused beef stew\
  \ is to look forward though in Barbara\u2019s.\n\nAfter that, we seized the period\
  \ till sunset with a stroll exiting Intramuros and ending up on the iconic Rizal\
  \ Park. It was never stressful for her aunt since we are almost vagabonds looking\
  \ for the best place for Philippine history throwbacks.\n\nShe was happy regardless,\
  \ looking back at these histories, even our own. Time will tell where history will\
  \ transport us next. We may never know."
