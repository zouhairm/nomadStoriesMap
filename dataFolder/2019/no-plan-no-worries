Text: "I quit my job.\nWow. And what will you do now?\nNo idea.\n\tBut you need a\
  \ plan!\nReally? \n\nAfter seven years I decided to quit my job. I had no plan what\
  \ would come next, but it felt right not knowing. Everyone asked me what I was going\
  \ to do now or if I already had a new job. I told them: \u201CYou know what? I have\
  \ absolutely no idea.\u201D \nI decided to go on a vacation. Bali had been on my\
  \ list for a while, so I knew that was going to be my destination. I pictured myself\
  \ amidst fresh green rice terraces, going to yoga classes every day, having healthy\
  \ smoothies for breakfast. Hong Kong is one of my favourite places, but I had only\
  \ been there for work. So, I wanted to go there to finally explore this place and\
  \ soak it all in. After figuring out how to best combine these two stops I added\
  \ Vietnam and Singapore to the route. The first thing that came to my mind when\
  \ thinking about Vietnam was Pho and coriander \u2013 which I don\u2019t really\
  \ like - but I figured there would be more to a country than coriander. Singapore\
  \ was more or less only a stopover on my way to Bali, but I read about a Minimalism\
  \ art exhibition I really wanted to see.\n\nI booked the flights and told everyone\
  \ I had a plan now. Sort of.\n\nI am going on vacation for eight weeks.\n\tWow.\
  \ What are your plans?\nI will decide once I get there.\n \nDo you know the feeling\
  \ when you arrive somewhere and the smell makes you instantly feel happy and at\
  \ home? Hong Kong is such a place for me. Yes, it is a terrible smell. Dusty, damp\
  \ carpets at the airport and whatever parts of dead animals they cook on the streets\
  \ mixed with a sweet smell of fruits. But I love it. \n\nVietnam, however, was a\
  \ complete blank page. What would it be like? What would it smell like? Would I\
  \ like it? Where would I end up going? What would I eat? I had absolutely no idea\
  \ what to expect. I ended up having the most delicious barbeque in a small side\
  \ street, sitting on a tiny plastic chair, sideways, because my legs didn\u2019\
  t fit underneath the tiny table. I have always loved coffee, but have you ever had\
  \ a Vietnamese coffee? This mix of sweet condensed milk and strong coffee is pure\
  \ heaven. I cycled through beautiful landscapes of lime stones and never-ending\
  \ green fields. I rented a scooter for the first time in my life and cruised around\
  \ the whole day. And all this without a plan. \n\nFor Singapore I had one thing\
  \ on my list: visit the Minimalism art exhibition. I entered the first room, walked\
  \ around a little until I found myself standing in front of a beautiful piece of\
  \ art by one of favourite painters, Mark Rothko. I just stood there, gazing into\
  \ this black and grey painting. After a while the museum guard joined me. First,\
  \ we just stood there side by side. Then, he turned to me, smiled and started talking.\
  \ About the idea behind the exhibition, what Minimalism means and that it has a\
  \ lot in common with Buddhism. He explained that both are about letting go and making\
  \ yourself aware of everything. Of your surroundings, your thoughts and being aware\
  \ of the very moment. \u201CJust like you are doing it right now. I watched you\
  \ walk through the room, how you stand and look at the paintings.\u201D After five\
  \ weeks without a plan I was on the right path I guess. \n\nHaving no plan turned\
  \ out to be the best eight weeks I could have ever imagined. I could have never\
  \ planned this. Sometimes not knowing will lead you somewhere Google can\u2019t.\
  \ Just walk without a map. Along the way you will see all the things you would have\
  \ just passed while starring at the little blue dots on your phone indicating the\
  \ way. Remember my idea of me in Bali? Well, the first two weeks I did not join\
  \ one single yoga class. I went surfing instead."
