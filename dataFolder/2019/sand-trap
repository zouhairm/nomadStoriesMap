Text: "Only one road connected Lima and Huacachina, and I didn\u2019t mind the drive.\
  \ \n\nAfter a year in Peru, I knew the routine: hours of uninhabited desert that\
  \ suddenly opened into South America\u2019s only oasis, a not easily accessible\
  \ sanctuary surrounded by golden dunes which were perfect for introducing some visiting\
  \ friends to sandboarding. \n\nWe piled into my car and departed early in the morning.\
  \ As we sped through hundreds of kilometers of unforgiving topography we rarely\
  \ encountered other drivers, let alone people or places to stop.\n\nAbout ten minutes\
  \ from our destination, angry black smoke signaled trouble ahead. We rolled to a\
  \ standstill maybe fiftieth in a line of vehicles that appeared permanently parked.\n\
  \nPeering around the congestion, I saw scores of locals had started a bonfire in\
  \ the roadway. They burned tires, furniture, and vegetation, and marched intensely\
  \ around the flames. \n\nI approached one of the leaders, and he explained they\
  \ were farmers protesting the installation of water pipes underneath their land.\
  \ We were just three visitors from Lima headed south, and we wanted to pass without\
  \ making any trouble. \n\n\u201CNo problem,\u201D he assured me. \u201CYou can come\
  \ through. Ma\xF1ana.\u201D\n\n\u201CTomorrow?\u201D\n\n\u201CYes,\u201D he continued,\
  \ \u201CAround seven tomorrow, you can pass then.\u201D  \n\nHe left no room for\
  \ further discussion. \n\nOn the side of the road, in the desert, I considered our\
  \ options. We did not have many. We faced potentially the continent\u2019s most\
  \ effective blockade, which had been designed to mercilessly snarl traffic in both\
  \ directions. Only one modernized highway linked Peru\u2019s major cities, and all\
  \ commerce and tourism depended on it. Already cars were backing up behind me. The\
  \ farmers had chosen their target effectively.\n\nIt would be least four hours back\
  \ to Lima, and as I contemplated our dilemma I almost didn\u2019t notice the old\
  \ man in jeans and a work shirt who ambled over to quietly offer an alternative.\
  \ \n\n\u201COy\xE9,\u201D he interjected, \u201CI heard your problem. I know a way\
  \ around. $20 and I\u2019ll bring you.\u201D \n\nI asked for more details, and he\
  \ motioned at a small settlement 100 yards from the highway. \n\n\u201CThrough there,\
  \ fifteen minutes, very easy, no road,\u201D he said. \u201CTwenty dollars.\u201D\
  \ \n\nNot ideal, but I told him I\u2019d consider it. \n\nBack in the car, we quickly\
  \ conferred. We were far from anywhere and obviously desperate, so this could be\
  \ a trap. My beat up old Fiat barely handled the highway \u2013 let alone actual\
  \ terrain \u2013 and any damage would leave us stranded.\n\nStill, I spoke Spanish,\
  \ somehow had cell service, and the oasis loomed tantalizingly ahead, just beyond\
  \ the blockade. We deliberated and accepted, resolving to record directions diligently\
  \ in case we needed to suddenly retreat. \n\nOur guide slid into his jalopy and\
  \ signaled to follow as he steered away from the highway. I cautiously navigated\
  \ the sand road, but without warning he took a hairpin turn around a hut and we\
  \ mirrored him instinctively. He aggressively accelerated, with no regard for the\
  \ lack of pavement or the people standing around, and I feverishly tried to keep\
  \ pace. \n\nWith the village behind us we careened towards distant greenery, and\
  \ when we reached its entrance we split two trees and curled around a rock. Now\
  \ inside a forest, I furiously shifted gears across roots and divots and made more\
  \ than a dozen turns, and at the end of it all, I\u2019ll be damned if we didn\u2019\
  t emerge inside the oasis itself.\n\nGrinning widely, the old man approached, asking\
  \ only for the $20 he\u2019d earned. We shook hands, and he disappeared into the\
  \ desert. \n\nLater, we examined the scribbled directions. \n\n\u201CLeft at rock,\
  \ right at tree,\u201D our contingency plan offered only an illusion of control.\
  \ We laughed and realized how much we had ceded to our guide, wondering whether\
  \ we had been right to trust, or simply lucky.  \n\nWe spent a gorgeous day sliding\
  \ among dunes as soft as pillows, and when the broiling sun finally set over the\
  \ oasis we raised a glass to our unexpected hero. \n\nThe next morning, up before\
  \ the light, I hustled my friends to the car. \n\nThe blockade relented briefly\
  \ at seven.\n\nI knew only one road back to Lima, and this time I planned to use\
  \ it."
