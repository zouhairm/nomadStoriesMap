Text: "Usually a traveler on the tour makes a safe travel plan already, but my travel\
  \ was intended.\nAll the people were running back from the beautiful places going\
  \ on \nI also tell you briefly what was the situation on my target trip.\nAn earthquake\
  \ of Magnitude Mw = 7.6 occurred on October 8, 2005 at 08:50 am local time causing\
  \ damage and casualties over an area of 30,000 km2 in the N-W.F.P. Tourist province\
  \ of Pakistan \nThis was the deadliest earthquake in the recent history of the sub-continent\
  \ this earthquake are estimated to be larger than those of the tsunami of December\
  \ 2004.\nSuch a travel experience may probably have a chance to my life, maybe I\
  \ cannot see my life now, tour guides of these beautiful places were now offended\
  \ by this world, with a relief team consisting of doctors and paramedical staff,\
  \ I traveled from Karachi city Pakistan to the 36 hour by bus on these places, The\
  \ field hospital was set up in Azad Kashmir Pakistan. We started the work there,\
  \ everywhere there was an atmosphere of death, People were running from the city,\
  \ most of the injured were bone breakdown cases, we continued our support according\
  \ to our ability, and those who were more injured have been delivered to Helipad\
  \ so that they can go to a large city hospital. The dead bodies that were getting\
  \ rid of buildings were buried in accordance with Muslim customs, It was a strange\
  \ chaos, The people who were working were linked to relief organizations. Medical\
  \ and voluntary workers were working with countries around the world I saw that\
  \ an institution was installing a water plant so a volunteer performs cleaning duties,\
  \ so there was a group building bath rooms; many human being was taking care of\
  \ food. The lesson of humanity was showing me from my eyes, in this place, all people\
  \ were behaving differently from color and race nationality and religion. One morning,\
  \ one person was in trouble and said that our villages are at a high level and no\
  \ relief is being reached, the next day we reached with him, the way to the path\
  \ was really difficult, our volunteers and doctors treated patients. One thing I\
  \ realized was that people from all over the world were helping. Especially foreign\
  \ women volunteers' services were enormous, who was leaving this house and was living\
  \ in a dangerous place.\nIt was not a game but this game was not over yet.\nThe\
  \ winter season was very close and the cold weather affected the danger of resurrection\
  \ on the affected people. These moments were calling humanity\n\nIt was the lovely\
  \ location, where every year the number of people used to travel there, It was time\
  \ to repay the debt of humanity, Here I got the lesson of humanity and service that\
  \ I could not find, Because it was a big tragedy and humanity of every region of\
  \ the world was working there, \n The one who has a golden opportunity to see and\
  \ learn, many weeks stayed here, earthquake shocks were also being felt, we carefully\
  \ slept in the open plain area\nOne day just a fresh mind went out for a walk in\
  \ a ruined city with colleagues we saw a small hotel that was destroyed, where a\
  \ chef was cooking, we made a choice of bread from him and gave money but he refused\
  \ to take the money and said that you has come here for the time when everyone is\
  \ running away from there. Feel many moments and emotions that do not have words\
  \ to describe.\nThe only thing I would say is that the opportunity for such a trip\
  \ to come in my life suddenly, which I achieved by making decisions on time.\nSuch\
  \ a chance may now be later than a century, which is not in my life\n I want to\
  \ tell the travel story readers, do not let the Golden Choice go and take a quick\
  \ decision.\n This incident lasted for more than a year, but I think I am a supporter\
  \ and proud of this journey.\nThat's a minor service, but the opportunity for such\
  \ services is not available to everyone,"
