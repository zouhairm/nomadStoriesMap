Text: "\u201CWhere are you headed?\u201D one of my travel companions called out to\
  \ me as I passed her swaying hammock. I shrugged and waved her off as I continued\
  \ on towards my bike.  \n\nI hadn\u2019t much of a plan for the day. I had been\
  \ living in Thailand for two months with a group of people who, prior to this trip,\
  \ had been strangers. Our current home was Koh Phangan, an island best known for\
  \ its bodacious Full Moon parties. However, we were living on the outskirts of Surat\
  \ Thani: a much calmer world of yogis and locals. It had suited us well to be away\
  \ from the hustle of party-driven American tourists. Although the bungalows offered\
  \ a languid shady space directly on the beach, I was feeling the draw of the unknown\
  \ world beyond the safety of our little haven. And so I left.\n\nI trudged through\
  \ the sand towards the alcove where the group parked our bikes, already feeling\
  \ the sun blistering down upon my uncovered shoulders, and vaguely wondering whether\
  \ I should have applied sunscreen. A rhetorical thought really. Revving up the bike,\
  \ I pulled out of the hidden beach, dodging barefoot children, dogs, and an assortment\
  \ of chickens as I approached the road. \n\nThe wind on the bike offered a release\
  \ from the stifling heat of the island, although my hair did stick to the sweat\
  \ under the helmet that I petulantly refused to go without. A split-second decision\
  \ had me turning left and away from the boundless coast I\u2019d been following\
  \ into town. \n\nAfter driving for about 10 minutes without finding much aside from\
  \ a few hip new-age cafes, I finally came across something new. I looked to my left\
  \ to find a Buddhist temple, or Wat, looking awfully deserted save for the usual\
  \ multitude of scrappy dogs milling across the premise. I pulled off the road and\
  \ ditched my bike as discreetly as possible outside. \n\nI was hesitant; I find\
  \ that as a tourist you walk a fine line between exploring cultural diversity and\
  \ invading local traditional spaces. I hovered outside the main temple, enraptured\
  \ by the bright reds, yellows and gold fixings that reached up in intricate swirls\
  \ towards the sky. I didn\u2019t notice the figure in orange approaching from the\
  \ right until he was next to me. He was clearly a monk, with his saffron orange\
  \ Kashaya robe draped over his shoulder, a pair of old-fashioned spectacles perched\
  \ on his nose, and probably 20 amulets hanging from a strings of black beads around\
  \ his neck. He threw me a friendly smile, before gesturing towards the temple gate,\
  \ an unspoken question; would you like to see? I nodded gratefully and he led me\
  \ through the gate and into the intricate building, gesturing to my  phone and mimed\
  \ snapping pictures, grinning all the while. Go on, take some photos. \n\nAfter\
  \ he was satisfied that I\u2019d gotten enough photos, he called me over to one\
  \ of the large bells hanging from the building and demonstrated hitting one with\
  \ a mallet before handing it to me and indicating that I should do the same, after\
  \ which he directed me to fold my hands palm to palm and bow slightly. He led me\
  \ around the entire frame of the building, stopping at each of the large bells to\
  \ complete this little ritual. \n\nAt one point he exclaimed excitedly and leaned\
  \ over the railing, pointing and waving wildly that I should do the same. I did,\
  \ and to my surprise, saw a large blue and orange speckled gecko blinking back at\
  \ me.  I laughed and he again gestured to my phone. Get a photo of that!\n\nAfter\
  \ I had finished the full round of the building, having stopped at each of the 15\
  \ bells, my new friend lit three incense sticks and had me kneel before the large,\
  \ golden Buddha. I agreed, reflecting in the stillness of the moment. I thought\
  \ about my luck at having met this joyful little man who had allowed me a glimpse\
  \ into a beautiful religion. And although I had been enraptured by the prayer ritual,\
  \ it was perhaps his kindness that had most impacted my previously uninteresting\
  \ day."
