Text: "It all started long time ago, when I was little I always used to go on all\
  \ of schools' trips, I always tried to participate in all the activities outside\
  \ school, By collage time I choose tourism guidance department for the love of traveling,\
  \ history and culture. In 2011 the miracle happened as I met my travel partner/best\
  \ friend we were talking and by coincidence she was telling me that she never traveled\
  \ before and wishes to travel to Spain so It suddenly came back to me and we started\
  \ to prepare for our first trip abroad, first passport first everything and of course\
  \ every single person thought we are crazy to travel in such circumstances 2 Egyptian\
  \ young ladies, ZERO experience in such conservative community adding \u201Cthe\
  \ revolution of Jan 25\u201D but we challenged it all and traveled and it was a\
  \ blast :D the moment we returned back from Spain everyone wanted to travel with\
  \ us next year. \nBy the end of 2011 I changed jobs and was working as an Executive\
  \ Assistant which mainly 80% of my work was travel arrangements for managers literary\
  \ all over the world. I must admit that I spend a hell of a lot of time dreaming\
  \ and planning for their travels as if I\u2019m the one who\u2019s traveling far\
  \ more time than I spend actually travelling. The amount of trips that I have planned\
  \ in word documents and excel far outnumber the amount of trips I have taken, let\
  \ alone the number of times I have daydreamed about destinations.  So I gained the\
  \ experience needed to plan a trip on my own once a year, it was like my get away\
  \ trip, where I\u2019m actually independent and free, it\u2019s like a target that\
  \ I work on all year starting from choosing the destination till reaching it, so\
  \ I\u2019m inspired to travel 24/7 mainly When life is feeling boring and aimless,\
  \ it is hard for me to not want to look up some hotel packages, Google some articles\
  \ about my dream destinations. But once a year now is not enough, I travel abroad\
  \ twice a year and internally as much as I can, I\u2019m always running out of annual\
  \ leaves and money before the year ends. \nI became a travel freak \u201Cand proud\u201D\
  \ always curious and want to experience new cultures, languages and people.  I want\
  \ my kids to be like me, to grow up as global citizens, embracing differences. \
  \ I hope them to be able to experience the world in a way that I haven\u2019t due\
  \ to the restrictions I\u2019m suffering from in my society because I\u2019m an\
  \ Egyptian girl. \nBut what mainly inspires me to travel is that I want to live\
  \ life.  I want to experience everything and everywhere. I want to know what it\u2019\
  s like to dance in Carnival in Brazil or to live on an island in the Maldives or\
  \ see whales breaching in Iceland.  I want to be able to communicate in other languages\
  \ and dance the flamenco.\nTravel is not just a hobby or a vacation for me.  It\
  \ is my passion, it changed a lot and developed a lot in my personality and experience\
  \ of life, quoting Ibn Battuta \u201CTraveling \u2013 it leaves you speechless,\
  \ then turns you into a storyteller.\u201D  When I\u2019m meeting people for the\
  \ first time and we have nothing to say I break the ice by asking them do you like\
  \ to travel? And all of a sudden the stories start flowing to give them the inspiration\
  \ to travel and this is how I\u2019m living my life now, saving money, travelling,\
  \ repeat."
