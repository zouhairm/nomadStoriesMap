  \ that one the train was so crowded with people and he was so tired but he can't\
  \ believe that he could found a seat in that train he was so tired so he slept \
  \ deeply. \nAnd then he walked up quickly and was so astonished cause he found that\
  \ no people on the train it was empty!!\nBut train was still moved quickly and it\
  \ wasn't stop. Jack tried to see who was driving the train, he was surprised that\
  \ no one was there and he discovered that he was the only person on the train .Jack\
  \ was so scared cause a lot of questions was in his head who was moved the train\
  \ and why he was alone and the important question where was he go??\nThe train started\
  \  to go be slow and  Jack started  to think if he could jump from the train. He\
  \ was so puzzled between jumping from the train or continue with it.\nHe couldn't\
  \ continue and he finally decided to jump from the train . He jumped and fall on\
  \ the sand he couldn't see anyone or anything he started feeling regret cause he\
  \ jumped. \nHe walked a lot untill he found something  was moving and he was afraid\
  \ and it was located to him\nIt was a young animal it seemed like a young Dragon\
  \ and it was so hungry and he tried to smile  jack and Jack 's emotions was mixed\
  \ but he loved him and he searched any food in his pocket and Luckly  he found a\
  \ sweets and he gave it the Dragon was so happy and he tucked the sweets and then\
  \ Jack decided to gave the Dragon a name he choosed  (Red) cause it's skin was red\
  \ .\nFrom that moment Red always walked where Jack walked and Jack tried a lot of\
  \ time to make it go away from him but actually it was like a friend for him. Jack\
  \ still walk about 3 days and all his sweets was end and he was so thrusty and hungery\
  \ he couldn't effort all that and he fainted . Then when he walked up and opened\
  \ his eyes he could see that he was so close to the clouds even he tried to tuch\
  \ it. Quickly he realized that he was flying and the biggest surprise that he was\
  \ sleeping on a huge Dragon. He thought that Dragon was Red 's mother. So he was\
  \ alittle calm. He told himself that he was already dead so he didn't try to do\
  \ anything he just lied down.\nFinally the Dragon left him in  its nest. Jack didn't\
  \ know what he should do but he saw something moved in that nest it was covered\
  \ with a big leave so he couldn't see it but it was still moving and Jack could\
  \ see something it was like an arm!!\nJack was so terrified.  But he was happy cause\
  \ he finally found a human in that place and he still a live.\nWhen Dragon  was\
  \ feed Red and Red 's brothers they were about 5 .so Jack run quickly to the human\
  \ and he carried him on his shoulder and running fast as he could but the human\
  \ was screaming and then kicked Jack in his stomach and human running come back\
  \ to the nest he saw it it was a young girl with an orange hair and blue eyes. She\
  \ screamed mum!!\nHe didn't understand anything and he wouldn't . He tried to run\
  \ a way alone but Dragon was behind him. It caught him and bring him back to the\
  \ nest. Dragon was so angry and tried to attack him but the girl said something\
  \ to the Dragon Jack couldn't understand it . Actually she could talk with Dragon\
  \ . He understood that she was pretending him from the Dragon and he could took\
  \ a rest."
