Text: "So it was the last day and i had just been happy about the days here international,\n\
  The last day was as usual planned something that wasn\u2019t at all optional. \n\
  Ayutthaya city is where we had to go,\nUnknown people coming across was all i had\
  \ a thought about.\nYou being our first pickup in our pack with a skin so fine,\n\
  I told my friend you\u2019re pretty, but i was literally bemused by your beauty\
  \ and the sunshine. \nMy eyes were paining and it did increase as the journey went\
  \ on,\nBut I doubt we spent even an hour before the silence between us was gone.\n\
  From talking about the places about my native nation,\nTo showing all my images\
  \ and telling you about my passion. \nTalks and chit chats went on and on till we\
  \ were done with the first temple visit,\nPost this i got lucky, next to you I could\
  \ sit.\nLucky or shall i say it was god\u2019s grace,\nBut things went on their\
  \ own pace. \nTemples came and went, and then we came to the last before the meal,\n\
  I wanted to make you sit next to me or me next to you, but that couldn\u2019t become\
  \ a fulfilled deal.\nWe took some beer shifted the gear, looked at each other and\
  \ smiles went on,\nWe talked post lunch and then there was this temple that took\
  \ too long.\nToo much time consumed too much sweat we did,\nBut at the end we had\
  \ a pretty good click. \nPost the walk through the temples to somewhat a walk to\
  \ remember, we all got tired, and yes I mistakenly slept on your shoulder. \nI don\u2019\
  t know what feeling was it but i had some good nap,\nand then we made a plan to\
  \ khaosan, well that was some good crap. \nTalks over liquor, us getting sober,\n\
  Post 10 beers, all i felt good was a walk to remember. \nHands in hands smiles we\
  \ shared,\nSomehow somewhere i knew i did cared.\nWe held the hands, and then you\
  \ asked me to sit outside the hotel,\nI talked to these strangers for sometime and\
  \ when you came i told them my date for the night is here. \nYeah i did tell them\
  \ the exact sentence,\nWell let that be we went back to the club cuz we were hungry\
  \ and impatient. \nTalks and more drinks got gulped,\nConversations went on and\
  \ we were all pumped. \nI went to pay the bill, i guess that was the worst choice,\n\
  At the end they spoiled our mood by making us pay twice.\nWell someone said that\
  \ goodbyes aren\u2019t so easy to be said ,\nBut we had to hug each other, and meet\
  \ again is what we wished. \nTake care of yourself till I meet you next,\nLet\u2019\
  s go on a trip together, reply on time okay whenever i text."
