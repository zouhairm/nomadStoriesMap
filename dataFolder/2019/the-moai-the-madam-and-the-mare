Text: "Strolling the quiet morning streets of Hanga Roa, the lone town of Easter Island\
  \ (Isla Pascua in Spanish or Rapa Nui as the Polynesian descended locals prefer),\
  \ I notice a surprising dearth of people.  Although April is not the high season,\
  \ Easter Island is undoubtedly a year-round destination.  By late-morning, most\
  \ tourists seem to have already set out to visit the island\u2019s famous residents:\
  \  the moai (ancient anthropomorphic statues at various archeological sites.)  Centuries\
  \ ago, Polynesian settlers extracted and transported giant swaths of stone from\
  \ local quarries before carving and erecting these monolithic figures throughout\
  \ the island.  The statues\u2019 mystery, beauty, and prominence lure an estimated\
  \ 100,000 annual visitors. Tomorrow, I\u2019ll tour some of the more distant moai\
  \ by bicycle, but today\u2019s itinerary is a simple trek passing numerous statues\
  \ along the scenic northern shoreline.  However, the first sighting occurs before\
  \ even leaving Hanga Roa.  Overlooking the town\u2019s fishing port, Caleta Hanga\
  \ Roa, the two moai of Ahu Tautira are venerable and symbolic guardians of the village.\
  \  I marvel at the remarkable figures atop an ahu (ceremonial platform) as anchored\
  \ fishing boats lazily sway a few meters behind the stone behemoths. The juxtaposition\
  \ of modern and ancient is beautifully striking.  Already behind schedule, I buy\
  \ some tuna empanadas, locally caught I\u2019m told, and walk towards the post office.\
  \  Easter Island is a Chilean territory and therefore not a port of entry when arriving\
  \ via Santiago.   An unofficial passport imprint with the iconic moai logo can be\
  \ procured at the island post office for the cost of a voluntary gratuity.  After\
  \ a quick stamping, I toss some pesos into the \u2018propina\u2019 jar and exit\
  \ town.  From the edge of Hanga Roa, the closest moai complex, Tahai Ahu, can be\
  \ seen a few hundred meters to the northeast.   The first moai cluster within Tahai\
  \ Ahu, Ahu Vai Uri, consists of five impressive statues standing in a lateral line,\
  \ each varying in size and shape.  Like the overwhelming majority of Easter Island\u2019\
  s nearly one thousand moai, this grouping faces opposite the coastline.  It is theorized\
  \ by scholars and local mythology alike that the moai were erected looking inland\
  \ to hold steady vigil over the island\u2019s inhabitants.  Another ahu supports\
  \ the complex namesake, the solitary and imposing Tahai.  The most northerly and\
  \ unique of the group, Ko Te Riku, is one of just a few statues adorned with a hat\
  \ known as a pukao.  Additionally, Ko Te Riku is the sole moai with painted white\
  \ eyes, pristinely restored by archeologists decades ago.  Despite the close proximity\
  \ to town, Tahai Ahu emits a palpable sense of serenity and nostalgia.  While touring\
  \ these archaeological marvels, one realizes why visitors commonly hail Easter Island\
  \ as an \u2018open-air museum.\u2019  Unfortunately, the tranquility is fleeting.\
  \  Ahead the coastal path congregates a significant concentration of people.   Upon\
  \ approach, I notice the crowd includes police, press, and locals donning traditional\
  \ ceremonial garb.  The collective attention is focused on a stately woman standing\
  \ behind a podium.  As she prepares to speak, I ask a souvenir vendor as to the\
  \ orator\u2019s identity and am told it\u2019s Michelle Bachelet, President of Chile.\
  \  I have previously heard no mention of the Madam President\u2019s visit from Santiago\
  \ (3,756 km to the east), but am thrilled to bare witness.  As Ms. Bachelet begins\
  \ her speech, a stray dog wanders behind the podium.  In a moment of levity, she\
  \ welcomes the canine spectator and alludes to the crowd\u2019s diversity, eliciting\
  \ laughter.  Ms. Bachelet pledges to her island compatriots a continuation of inclusion\
  \ and a concerted preservation of Rapa Nui culture.  There is talk of enacting prudent\
  \ tourism limits to further protect both the island\u2019s ecosystem and its moai.\
  \  Following the speech, I continue through a scenic pastured landscape far away\
  \ from any other human being.  The Te Peu ruins lie several kilometers up the coast.\
  \ One cannot imagine a better exploration of this \u2018open-aired museum\u2019\
  \ than traversing vast green meadows along craggy coastline in route to yet another\
  \ archeological treasure.  Between myself and the coast grazes a wild mare as a\
  \ cargo ship drifts in the background. The mare pauses her meal to momentarily look\
  \ up, mindful, but not afraid of the traveler in her backyard."
