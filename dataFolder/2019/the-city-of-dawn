Text: "I have been on solo trip to Auroville, Tamilnadu. This was my first solo trip\
  \ and also very first trip to South India.\n\nI realised that I'm searching, searching\
  \ for what i really want in life.And you know what? I have absolutely no idea what\
  \ that is.\n\nIt was very difficult for me to make this happen.For clarification\
  \ I belong to a Marwari Family. In our families solo trip is the last thing anyone\
  \ will ever think about. There reaction was Akele kyu jana hai?Dosto ke saath jao\
  \ warna ghar aajao! (Like why you want to go alone? Go with your friends or else\
  \ just come home). As in every Indian Family the son gets the permission only when\
  \ his sister shorts out the matter with the parents.\n\nSo now the trip begins on\
  \ 18/02/2018 from Bombay. As it was my first solo trip I was excited as well as\
  \ little bit nervous about how things will catchup.\n\nAs I reach Auroville I was\
  \ filled with positive vibes. This place is great. Here I realised not every man\
  \ is a sucker. Each and every person here was so nice and polite.\n\nFor the first\
  \ time I was at a place where each and every person was so nice and the best thing\
  \ was they were not faking.\n\nAnd now I started to explore this place on this:-\n\
  \nNow reaching the Heart of this place MaitriMandir:-\n\nI lived in the New Creation\
  \ Guest House which was 4kms down the road from Auroville. On reaching the guest\
  \ house I realised that they were not running the guest house for making money but\
  \ for educating children's from the nearby villages. There were almost 45 children's\
  \ studying and living there on Zero expense.\n\nApart from that rooms were very\
  \ nice:-\n\nThere are alot of opportunities in Auroville. One should have atleast\
  \ one week in hand to do all the things here. I volunteered at Buddha Garden:-\n\
  \nHere I met different people belonging to different countries who are now settled\
  \ here away from chaos. On the left side in the picture is April from America(She\
  \ was very nice but was little confused why everyone makes fun of her name,I told\
  \ her it's common here also but we have names according to the Hindu calendar or\
  \ season for example \u2018Basant') and I forgot the name of the person on the right\
  \ side he was from Japan.\n\nThe best thing about solo trips is that you don't need\
  \ to take taxis you can rely on lifts. This one is when I was coming back to got\
  \ lift from A Truck Driver ( it was fun,the scene seems to me like a Bollywood movie!)\
  \ even when we were not able to communicate due to language barriers\n\nNow coming\
  \ to Pondicherry known as \u201CThe French State of India\u201D\n\nIf you are in\
  \ Pondicherry, Rock Beach has to be on your list.\n\nAnd don't forget to have a\
  \ sip of coffee at the only beach side cafe:-\n\nAnd last but above all the thing\
  \ which made my trip alot more happening was this\n\nIt was very difficult for me\
  \ as I have never been in much contact of water. Thankgod they gave training the\
  \ first day otherwise I have never done that.\n\nIt scared a hell out me on the\
  \ pool day. After my first dive I told the instructor \u201CBhai refund hojaega\
  \ kya\u201D(Dude can you give me refund)\n\nThanks to the  without his help I won't\
  \ have done  .\n\nThat day I realised in life each and every thing comes harder\
  \ at us and we shouldn't step back because of the fear. Maybe at first it will be\
  \ difficult but after some time and practice we can get over anything.\n\nLive your\
  \ life to the fullest.\n\nThankyou.\n\nPeace."
