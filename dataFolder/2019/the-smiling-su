Text: "Strolling by the busy town square on the first evening of my first solo trip,\
  \ I stumbled across an absolute gem. When an impromptu trip, on a long weekend brings\
  \ you to Mcleoadganj, such happy coincidences feel undoubtedly divine. I was clueless\
  \ about half the cuisines on the menu of Kalmpong restaurant, and so decided to\
  \ ask for help.  A young Tibetan girl, smiled at me from the adjacent table, as\
  \ she observed my clueless gawk. \"Try the Thupka,\" she told me after a cursory\
  \ conversation.  I prepared myself for a lonely dinner, but when the smiley-Tibetan\
  \ girl offered me company, I couldn't refuse. \n\nThe food and the conversation\
  \ were so heavenly, that I found myself overeating, and for some reason over-talking\
  \ too. Her name was Su, I learned. She lived with her mother, and managed a little\
  \ library nearby. We took a walk together through the square as the night bloomed\
  \ further. I learned about Dalai Lama, about the struggles of a daily life here,\
  \ the beauties of it, about Su's very own currency collection. One thing led to\
  \ another and she offered me to show me around over the next few days. \"Why not!,\"\
  \ I exclaimed. \n\nPetting the dogs on Triund Hill, naming them together, spinning\
  \ the sacred wheels at Kalchakra Temple, sharing food and hookah at Shiva's cafe,\
  \ by the end of the week Su and I had become Serendipitous Pals. Her knowledge about\
  \ Tibetan art and culture, her hefty bargaining skills, and her knowledge of Sanskrit\
  \ blew my mind. \n\nSu was really interested in the fact that I was a filmmaker.\
  \ We made a pact to meet again, at the Dharamshala Internation Film Festival, bound\
  \ to happen later in the year, before we said our goodbyes. \n\nEven today, whenever\
  \ someone mentions Mcleodganj, Su's smile flashes before my eyes inadvertently."
