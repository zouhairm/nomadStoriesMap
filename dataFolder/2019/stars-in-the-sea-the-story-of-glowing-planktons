Text: "They say,  solo trips are the best kind.  You embark upon a journey outward,\
  \ in order to travel inward.  The Gokarna trip in the April of 2018, happened to\
  \ me in this way! Gokarna is a small, quaint town town in Coastal Karnataka, India.\
  \  It is known for its pristine beaches and temples tucked away in it's tiny roads.\
  \  \n    As the famous quote goes, there is nothing that salt water can't solve..\
  \  Tears,  Sweat or the sea,  I went to Gokarna to quench my soul.  As soon as I\
  \ got down the bus,  the humidity was palpable.  I started walking (at the moment\
  \ I had no isea,  it was the wrong route) and happily got lost in the greenery of\
  \ the town.  Due to the kindness of a sweet local,  I reached my place of stay -\
  \ Zostel, a backpackers hostel on a moped.  \n     After the much awaited jump into\
  \ the sea,  walking around the town or biking for two entire days, I was peacefully\
  \ having my lunch at Mantra Cafe.  The sound of the sea and crunch of my garlic\
  \ bread seemed to mingle perfectly.  That is when I met two strangers, Neelima and\
  \ Sadanand**.  They were both doctors and having a debate on zodiac signs.  Me being\
  \ well versed in Linda Goodman, pitched in with few of my pearls of wisdom.  What\
  \ started off as friendly banter turned into dinner promises.  So,  for the first\
  \ time in my life,  I had made friends from far away.  \n    The next day,  Neelima\
  \ and Sadanand planned to go to another beach called Nirvana beach.  They said there\
  \ would be glowing planktons there, I for one was very excited.  I had never seen\
  \ glowing planktons before in my life.  So, we happily rented two motor bikes that\
  \ looked like insects and went on our way to Nirvana beach.  The most exciting part\
  \ of the journey was, riding our motor bikes onto a ferry to reach our destination.\
  \  \n   There is something about small towns, with cycles parked on mud roads beside\
  \ coconut trees.  Though I am a city girl,  I felt at home here.  \n     We finally\
  \ reached Nirvana beach and had rented out Tree Houses for ourselves.  The view\
  \ from atop was breath taking! It was night, around 9:15, when ee finally ventured\
  \ into the sea.  At first, there was nothing we could see and I feltbavtinge lf\
  \ disappointment, but as we drew closer to the waves, I could swear I saw a shine\
  \ in a miss and go.  When we went even more close,  we saw the waves bringing in\
  \ the little glowing planktons.  The unpolluted night sky had a glorious display\
  \ of stars and the sea seemed to play along.  It was literally like stars shinning\
  \ in the sea.  When I held them in my hand, it felt like I has a small puzzle piece\
  \ of the cosmos in my palms.  My heart beat faster, it was overwhelming and surreal\
  \ at the same time, it was like falling in love for the first time! \n    The horizon\
  \ of the sea, is often said to make our existence insignificant by its sheer vastness.\
  \  But today, have these twinkling little stars in my hands, made me feel like I\
  \ was a part of the grand magical plan of the mutliverses that collide, merge and\
  \ give births to newer ones.  It was like the earth was upside down and my feet\
  \ were on the sky, as I looked up onto earth.  It was the fantasy come true from\
  \ all the J. K. Rowling,  Enid Blyton, Roald Dahl  and Dr. Seuss I had read as a\
  \ child.  I was transported, I was goosebumped,  tingly all over,  I was mesmerized,\
  \ I was in the presence of the magical divine! \n(**-names changed for privacy purposes)"
