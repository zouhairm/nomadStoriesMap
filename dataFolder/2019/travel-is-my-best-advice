Text: "I remember that day when I convinced myself that the best costume for the parade\
  \ that is life, will not be given to you by a tailor, if not the textures of the\
  \ world. \nI took a fly to China I didn\u2019t know how the life looks like there\
  \ but I was sure about it was amazing, and it was. I don\u2019t speak Chinese and\
  \ they don\u2019t speak Spanish , even English spoken are few there, I was afraid\
  \ but also exited I had a dream : be in the Great Wall , it was complicated , the\
  \ Chinese culture is different , there looks like everyone is telling you everything\
  \ in  mad mood and  jelling and pushing you , you shouldn\u2019t take it personal\
  \ because is not , they\u2019re not very friendly with the tourists maybe is because\
  \ you are representing something different, I remember I saw how they used to make\
  \  daily life and it cost to me be part of them , all the places are totally full\
  \ at anytime , the subway, the fashion mall, the restaurants , the public squares\
  \ , the restroom in the flow , the average house size (which is very small like\
  \ 2x2 ) the life run quickly, the cities doesn\u2019t sleep, the food which is most\
  \ of the times is not very normal as in this part of the world, I ate dog, cat,\
  \  duck , mouse ,fried horse sea , scorpions and snakes all of those tasty for them\
  \ and stranger to me.  The  smell in the streets are very peculiar, I\u2019m not\
  \ sure if is the food, the people or the bunch of garbage in every corner but is\
  \ hard to forget, they don\u2019t use ice because they believe the ice  damage the\
  \ soul , so try to imagine walk for 40 minutes on  40 degrees sunny day ,  and can\u2019\
  t find any cold water bottle and you just can take hot tea, yes is not the best\
  \ reward to your journey but is part of it even in the  American chains food stores\
  \ the ice is like a treasure that you won\u2019t find in all of Them,  doesn\u2019\
  t matter if you have enough money to pay for it, you wont have it \n\nThe architecture\
  \ is like two worlds in one , you can see the past in the pagodas and the future\
  \ in the modern buildings full of neon lights, as China is a very conservative country\
  \ and the most of the people can\u2019t travel around the world , the government\
  \ decided to bring them the most famous architecture buildings of the world , you\
  \ can see the Eiffel Tower , the T\xE1mesis River , the Big Ben, even they have\
  \ a Disney which is at least for me the best in the world. \nThe security level\
  \ is just amazing, you can be walking  any time everywhere  and you will be  secure\
  \ , there is cameras in every  block and the people is very caution with their personal\
  \ score for that reason they don\u2019t steal, but as part of the security process\
  \ you can\u2019t use Facebook or other popular occidental  social networks For this\
  \ reasons they have their social networks. The sale of  fake luxury items are other\
  \ of most important in China streets, actually there  is a specific square where\
  \ you can find all the most expensive luxury fashion items at very slow cost with\
  \ great quality. \n\nFinnaly i got my dream come true I went to the Great Wall ,\
  \ is Wonderfull you should know the Great Wall is divided in 10 Parts I saw Mutianyu\
  \ part. I travel 4 hours by train from Shanghai to Beijing,  if you are student\
  \ will receive a discount in the entrance ticket.  \n\nIn general be in China is\
  \ be in a different world, with a different food, language, architecture, people\
  \ and restrooms lol. \nIf you want to Learn about history and put  your adaptability\
  \ level in test China is the best country to do it."
