Text: "One, two, three. One foot off the boat, an inhale and then gravity took me\
  \ into the unknown. Submersed, I tried to make sense of the darkness and cool water\
  \ around me. This was my first night dive and I hadn\u2019t made up my mind yet\
  \ if I wanted it to be my last. The pitch black darkness of the waters reminded\
  \ me that sharks hunt at night and for the life of me I could not figure out how\
  \ to operate my flashlight -- panic may or may not have started to creep in. Luckily,\
  \ my dive group and I got oriented and we had our lights on as we started to descend.\
  \ The water began getting colder as we distanced ourselves from the beautiful moon\
  \ controlling the oceanic playground that we just entered. \nI see new life in the\
  \ forms of octopi, crustaceans, and sharks, calling a night washed ocean floor their\
  \ home and I just a visitor. As in awe of this new world as I was, I had no idea\
  \ what the sea still had in store for me that night.\nThe dive master motioned for\
  \ us to get into a circle and kneel on a patch of barren sand. Fiddling with my\
  \ buoyancy and finding a comfortable way to kneel seventy feet below sea level,\
  \ I was finally ready for one of the most memorable experiences of my life. \nFollowing\
  \ the directions that I was told on the surface, I placed my flashlight to my chest,\
  \ forbidding light to illuminate the cool dark waters. Silence and darkness surrounded\
  \ all of us for a few calm moments. Then, with the wave a hand, blue and green lights\
  \ danced a bioluminescent glow. I was completely mesmerized and felt as if I were\
  \ in space -- or possibly even heaven. The calmness of the waters, the soft and\
  \ beautiful glow of the bioluminescence and the quiet darkness of the night created\
  \ one of the most peaceful moments I had ever encountered. The wash of calmness\
  \ continued to pour over me and it seemed impossible to think that when I had leapt\
  \ into this unknown, I was panicked. Time seemed to have stopped all together in\
  \ this new universe that I just discovered, and I was not sure how I would ever\
  \ be able to leave it.\nWhen it was time to ascend, I knew that I may not ever be\
  \ able to step back into my own little universe that I just found. But either way,\
  \ I knew that I would always be grateful that I took that leap, that I welcomed\
  \ the unknown."
