Text: "Every traveler seems to want to meet new people and network with them and learn\
  \ about them and their culture and experience other cultures on their journeys \u2013\
  \ in short, we all want to connect locally. However, a question can pop up in one\
  \ mind that how do you actually define to make a local connection?\n\nWell everyone\
  \ may have their own way to answer this question according to their experience and\
  \ knowledge. There will always be people who sit on the spectrum of this debate,\
  \ but perhaps connecting locally is a concept that can only be defined by the individual\
  \ traveler, and by the specific experience. Maybe it is the case of finding what\
  \ we seek.\n\nA few months back, my classmates and I visited one of the most populous\
  \ cities of Pakistan Lahore and stayed there for 7 days. We visited to the historical\
  \ places there which were the remnants of the Mughal Dynasty. We wander in the streets\
  \ of, a shopping district, where Punjabies were going about their lives \u2013 shopping\
  \ in the supermarket, picking up stuff from their local Markets and stopping to\
  \ talk to friends. We put away our cameras and sank into this \u2018real\u2019 life,\
  \ did a little shopping ourselves, stopped for a small hotel and took a light dinner\
  \ and observed these extraordinary, ordinary lives.\nThen we moved on to the Shrine\
  \ of Datha Saab which also known is \"Datha Darbar\" and experience a new image\
  \ of Religious believe and got ourselves acquaintances with it and network with\
  \ people there.\n\nHere in this scenario, the time duration doesn't really matter,\
  \ You can have a 2 day stay in a country, or live there for a year, it doesn\u2019\
  t matter. You will still have a more enriching experience if you spark up a friendship\
  \ with a stranger.\n\nA new friend can provide insights into how it really is \u2013\
  \ not just what is in your Lonely Planet. You can see all the sights, hear all the\
  \ sounds, taste all the foods, and smell all the smells, but at the end of the day,\
  \ these things are only sensory. Culture is how the heart of a nation manifests\
  \ itself. And you can only get to the heart if you are able to have a \u2018heart\
  \ to heart\u2019.\n\nOne memorable experience which springs to mind was during my\
  \ travels to Landikotal in West of Pakistan. It was the Last days of the exam, so\
  \ without too much of an agenda, we set out for a short trip to the hilly areas\
  \ in the west of Pakistan which was on the transit road towards Afghanistan. We\
  \ had heard much about these hilly areas and the most important and historical gate\
  \ there know is Khyber Pass which is believed to be the route used by the Arians\
  \ for entering to the sub-continent. We chatted away easily with the locals and\
  \ we told him it was the celebration of our ended Exam. We also visited to the shrine\
  \ of the popular Poets of the Local language Pushto and got some clicks there.\n\
  \nIt was one day. Just one day out of months of traveling. We couldn't have planned\
  \ this type of local connection, but by seeking out an experience enjoyed by the\
  \ local people, we were rewarded with a unique, unforgettable cultural experience.\n\
  Thanks!"
