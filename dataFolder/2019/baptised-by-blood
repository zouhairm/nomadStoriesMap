Text: "After docking, the industrial like garage door of the ferry rolled up and I\
  \ blinked as blinding sunlight pierced my eyes.  Everything was reflective, from\
  \ the white of the paved sidewalk to the ferry building, to the twinkling cerulean\
  \ of the ocean, once fully surrounding me on the ship, now drifting off in a seemingly\
  \ endless expanse to the north.  The twelve hour ferry ride had taught me that I\
  \ was the only American on this ship, and I tried to look like I knew what I was\
  \ doing as I followed the wave of Tunisian and Sicilian travelers to the customs\
  \ office.\n\n       I had travelled solo many places, and I was growing comfortable\
  \ in my solitude.  Six months ago I had been to Morocco and loved the architecture\
  \ and artisan crafts. I planned this brief excursion to Tunis as a sidebar to my\
  \ pilgrimage to Sicily, where I hoped to visit Menfi, a little town in the countryside\
  \ where people with my surname originate. \n\n       In Tunis I was delighted to\
  \ find that women were freer than in Morocco, at least in terms of dress.  I had\
  \ packed loose harem pants and an oversized, long sleeved kimono top to wear, thinking\
  \ I would need to cover up, but as I walked from my hotel in the medina to the TGM\
  \ train I saw women in various states of undress, even wearing short shorts and\
  \ spaghetti strap tank tops.  I had not seen such scantily clad women in Morocco.\n\
  \n       I passed a relaxing afternoon in Sidi Bou Said, enjoying the gorgeous bougainvillea,\
  \ blue doors decorated with studs and various amusing door knockers that can only\
  \ be found in Maghreb.  As the sun blazed it\u2019s last bit of golden glow over\
  \ the cliffs, I boarded the train back to the Tunis medina.\nI enjoy the freedom\
  \ of travelling, and today had been especially liberating after being cooped up\
  \ on a ferry for twelve hours.  I settled into a blissful reverie on the train,\
  \ not realising I was being cased.  A hand slashed into my consciousness and ripped\
  \ my bag from my lap, turning my rapture upside down.  I stood up and ran after\
  \ my violator, stepping off of the now-moving train with my right foot feeling solid\
  \ on the platform, and my left getting caught in the train door.  The train dragged\
  \ and threw me into a metal gate on the platform, ripping my flesh off of the tissue\
  \ underneath, from inner upper arm, slashing around and not stopping until it reached\
  \ my elbow, where it ended in a fork.\n\n       Dazed, and not yet fully comprehending\
  \ what had happened, I stood up to keep running. My right arm felt strange so my\
  \ left hand reached across my body to touch it, and I was in direct contact with\
  \ my bicep muscle.  When pulled away, my hand was dripping with blood.  I started\
  \ to scream, an unearthly sound I had never heard emitted from my body.  Locals\
  \ crowded me on the train tracks as I squatted and howled, contemplated how much\
  \ blood a person could lose before dying, whether or not I would need a blood transfusion,\
  \ and fought off waves of blackness.\n       \n       Out of the crowd emerged an\
  \ angelic Tunisian woman, in her mid twenties, dressed in a yellow halter top, and\
  \ white and yellow flowy pants.  She spoke to me in English, held my left hand and\
  \ looked into my eyes and told me everything would be OK.  Someone handed me a t-shirt\
  \ and when I looked at them in confusion, she encouraged me to wrap my arm with\
  \ the shirt.  She accompanied me to the public hospital.  \n\n       After four\
  \ hours, the doctor there said he could not treat me and I needed to see a specialist.\
  \ Yosra found an appropriate hospital to take me to.  My stolen bag contained my\
  \ passport, all of my cards, cell phone and money, so in my abject state I also\
  \ had nothing but the clothes I was wearing.  The angelic Muslim woman who had just\
  \ made my acquaintance stayed with me until I went into surgery.  This was seven\
  \ months ago, and we still speak every day."
