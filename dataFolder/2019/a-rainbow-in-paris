Text: "Electric blue and yellow lights hit the stage as Cookie squatted to rebuckle\
  \ her heel. One of her spider-like eyelashes came unglued and floated to the floor\
  \ of the stage, but she just laughed and lifted the microphone to thick, drawn-on\
  \ lips, \u201CJe vous aime, mes enfants.\u201D As she smoothed her hands down the\
  \ curves of her waist, accentuated by a tight black corset, the music started and\
  \ the crowd pushed closer to the stage, excited to link arms and sing, \u201CYo,\
  \ I'll tell you what I want, what I really, really want!\u201D The room erupted\
  \ with different voices singing the Spice Girls anthem, and I grabbed the arm of\
  \ the person next to me-- a towering drag queen in four-inch heels-- and belted\
  \ in her perfectly-painted face.\n\nWhen I'd arrived in Paris two weeks before,\
  \ I never thought I'd end up in a drag bar singing pop music with strangers on a\
  \ Thursday night. On the drive from the airport to my apartment, I watched Parisians\
  \ walk down the street as if the cobblestones hadn\u2019t seen centuries of history.\
  \ The Notre Dame winked at me as we drove over the Seine, and I imagined biking\
  \ over the bridges with a baguette on Saturday mornings. The prospect of living\
  \ and traveling on my own excited me, and I quickly planned my first activities\
  \ in the city. I just didn\u2019t realize how alone I would be.\n\nEntering Sainte-Chapelle,\
  \ bathed in the red and blue hues of stained glass, was something I could only share\
  \ with my camera. Biking along the Seine stopped being fun when I realized I had\
  \ no one to laugh with as we dodged cars that veered into the bike lane. At the\
  \ end of the day, I would pour myself a glass of wine and look out my window as\
  \ laughter floated up to me, wondering why I wasn\u2019t laughing, too.\n\nMy second\
  \ week, I decided to find Paris\u2019 humanity and ventured into the warm night,\
  \ wearing leggings and a t-shirt. I passed by bars in the Latin Quarter, where students\
  \ my age drank cheap beer and flirted with one another, and kept walking. I hurried\
  \ through \xCEle Saint-Louis, where only expensive restaurants and tourists could\
  \ be found. When I veered right and found myself in the Marais, the vibe changed\
  \ completely.\n\nThe Marais has a reputation for being the most lively quarter in\
  \ Paris. It is also a safe haven for LGBT+ Parisians who feel out of place in the\
  \ more conservative parts of the city. Though this community has experienced centuries\
  \ of hate in France, their home in the Marais is famously welcoming to all who tread\
  \ its rainbow-painted crosswalks.\n\nAs I passed buildings with vibrating windows,\
  \ the streets came alive with several languages. Men and women in business attire,\
  \ probably enjoying after-work drinks, and students decked out in colorful outfits\
  \ shared cigarettes on the sidewalk. Smiling, I wandered around in my old running\
  \ shoes, feeling comfortable sharing a road with sparkling dresses, and stopped\
  \ when I heard Madonna\u2019s \u201CLike a Virgin\u201D drift out of an open window.\n\
  \nAs I walked into the dark bar, the bubblegum beats enveloped me, pushing me towards\
  \ the stage through a sea of fishnet tights. I stood on my toes to see the performer\
  \ wearing a long, scarlet cape as she swayed on a pair of high heels. Delicate red\
  \ swirls of eyeliner decorated her face, and she dragged the tip of a long, black\
  \ fingernail across the edge of her lip. I started singing the lyrics when the man\
  \ next to me gently touched my shoulder for support in the pulsing crowd. His wide\
  \ eyes were fixed on the performer as he bobbed his head, making a pair of dangly\
  \ earrings dance on his shoulders.\n\n\u201COh, mes enfants,\u201D the performer\
  \ laughed, dabbing her face carefully to not smear her rouge. I looked at the faces\
  \ of the men and women around me, wearing drag and loosened ties alike, as they\
  \ chanted \"Cookie! Cookie! Cookie!\" A world\u2019s worth of people, from different\
  \ walks of life, pressed against one another in a small bar to sing and dance and\
  \ laugh together. Cookie lifted the microphone and cried, \u201CAllons-y!\u201D"
