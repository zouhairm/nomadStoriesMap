Text: "Auntie Lizzie clears her throat. \u2018The Council of Elders,\u2019 she says,\
  \ in a measured, reassuring voice, \u2018is called maja-maja\u2019. She writes maja-maja\
  \ on the whiteboard. \u2018Each family has an elder on the Council. This is our\
  \ governance.\u2019\n\nClass has begun, but instead of chairs we have grass. Instead\
  \ of coloured posters or projectors are rustling trees and birds calling down to\
  \ us. The whiteboard stands in the middle of this land, a land Lizzie\u2019s family\
  \ has known for generations. Earlier in the day, they welcomed us, strangers, onto\
  \ the land with their Welcome to Country ceremony. We spun slowly in the haze, circling\
  \ the burning leaves, with the smoke dancing up to greet us.\n\u2018Now you are\
  \ protected! Now we are family,\u2019 said Auntie Lizzie.\n\nWe sit underneath the\
  \ open sky, surrounded by red earth, grass, a hut on a hill. It\u2019s their home.\n\
  \nMy home is 4,000 kilometres from where I sit, but even that number doesn\u2019\
  t convey the vastness of the distance between our lives. From the balcony of my\
  \ second-floor apartment, which still smells of fresh paint, I get a glimpse of\
  \ the skyline; I can wander, when I like, down to the local high street for dumplings\
  \ or dry cleaning. \n\nAuntie Lizzie\u2019s land was confiscated from her parents\
  \ but she fought for its return. She and her husband have what approximates a shed,\
  \ with a backdrop of native trees and sky. It is a wooden structure, effectively\
  \ one large room with a fireplace. It was in this room that Lizzie and her siblings\
  \ were born.\nWhen Lizzie showed us around her home earlier, she pointed to a framed\
  \ photograph. \u2018My mother,\u2019 she said, her chest noticeably swelling with\
  \ pride. \u2018Very beautiful woman. She made the best damper. We show you that\
  \ tomorrow.\u2019\n\nThere is not a supermarket within a half hour drive, but nearby\
  \ are other family members and over the coming days they will visit us. The children\
  \ will teach us some traditional dancing, doubling over laughing at our poor attempts\
  \ to emulate their fluid movements. Auntie Lizzie and Uncle Robert will sing to\
  \ us in their language, Kuku Nyungkal, while the light from the fire flickers gently\
  \ over their faces. As the sky turns to black their little granddaughter will curl\
  \ up in my lap, blinking slowly at the fire.\n\nBack at the whiteboard Auntie Lizzie\
  \ moves to teaching us Kuku Nyungkal. Bana. Majaji. Kari. Yuwu, bayon, kaday: I\
  \ roll these new words around on my tongue, enjoying how they feel. They are solid,\
  \ unyielding. There is a promise in each of them, to never give way. The family\
  \ survives."
