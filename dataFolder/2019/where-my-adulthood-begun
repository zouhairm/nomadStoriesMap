Text: "In summer 2018 after I graduated, I\u2019ve experienced Interrail through Netherlands,\
  \ Germany and Denmark. In Amsterdam I\u2019ve joined my 6 friends, we slept in humble\
  \ hostels and known young people from all over the world. In Amsterdam where our\
  \ trip begun we walked across the city for kilometers, got lost and  found ourselves\
  \ in local peolple, local food and local landscape. We moved to tears in front of\
  \ Van Gogh\u2019s masterpieces in the Van Gogh museum, we laughed in a coffee shop\
  \ in the middle of city\u2019s nightlife, we danced to the tune of latino music\
  \ in a club, we waved at girls in the windows of the Red Light Dinstrict. We were\
  \ amazed by the mills on the river at Zaanse Schans, we admired the magic of the\
  \ city\u2019s canals by night, by day, by sunrise and by sunshine. We learned how\
  \ to take care of ourselves but even how to help eachothers. We cleaned our clothes,\
  \ dishes, beds and floors. We felt sick and we felt on top of the world thanks to\
  \ the sublime of the view at Nemo museum, we hated and we loved eachothers. We cried\
  \ in front of the reports of the Second World War in Anna Frank Huis. We moved by\
  \ feet, by bike, by train and by plane. We spoke with people in English, Spanish,\
  \ German and even a bit in Dutch. We talked about our hopes, future, and aim in\
  \ life, we talked about our relationships, about our boyfriends and about matters\
  \ of the heart. We tried local food in a small restaurant run by a dutch grandmother,\
  \ but we ate at fastfoods and even cooked for us and for other friends. We drank\
  \ beer as locals do and with locals. And at the end of these seven days in Amsterdam,\
  \ we departed by train from the central station through a brand-new adventure in\
  \ Berlin, with excitement in the hearts for the past days and for the future weeks,\
  \ with backpacks full of memories and expectations.\nThanks to this trip, that I\u2019\
  ve done with my poor savings of a year, I\u2019ve became independent and free, a\
  \ wild spirit but responsable, openminded and a whole new person. I definitely would\
  \ do this trip again because it was the trip of a life, with the friends of a life,\
  \ but it won\u2019t be as mesmerizing as it was the first time, with the first experiences\
  \ that opened my mind and my heart and made me fell in love with the world, with\
  \ others cultures, people of different countries, with travels and I also fell in\
  \ love with my bestfriends I\u2019ve travelled with."
