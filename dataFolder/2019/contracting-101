Text: "Back in 2003, I had gone a year without being a high school English teacher.\
  \  Instead, I had been working for a temp service to quality control automotive\
  \ parts.  I worked, I didn't work.  Nothing was steady.  One evening I managed to\
  \ sneak out of work on a long break to grab a couple Bud lite tall boys and to visit\
  \ my buddy, Larry Gilbert.  He was a good friend and a brilliant confidante.  I\
  \ really needed advice on how to get my life back on track.  Not being able to stay\
  \ long, I gave Larry advance warning that I was on my way.  He met me out back,\
  \ jumped in the car, fired up his bullet and popped open a beer.\nI can't remember\
  \ the whole conversation, but the gist of his advice that night was for me to go\
  \ out to Ft Campbell and find out about contracting in the Middle East.  There was\
  \ a brand new war going on.  Why not?  He told me that he had considered it back\
  \ in 90 with the Persian Gulf.\n\nThe next day, I took his advice.  I found a few\
  \ opportunities with a company called KBR.  This was a reputable company as Kellogg,\
  \ Brown, and Root had been around since the Viet Nam war.  Also, the former CEO\
  \ was currently our Vice President.  At one brief period in time, I had been in\
  \ the US Army Reserves.  I had my qualifications and education in Unit Supply or\
  \ 76Y from Ft Lee, Va's Quartermaster School.  With this information, I went ahead\
  \ and got on line, filled out an application, and submitted my resume.  Then, I\
  \ went back to work and my miserable life.\nIt couldn't have been more than two\
  \ weeks later, I get a call from a guy in Afghanistan.  It seems his last name was\
  \ Cole.  He was the Deputy Project Mngr for the Southwest Asia Theatre.  That impressed\
  \ me as I also possess a BS from Austin Peay State University in Speech Communications\
  \ and Theatre Arts.  This was my big audition.  \nMr Cole told me that he saw that\
  \ I had a 76Y MOS and inquired about my supply experience.  \"Have you ever worked\
  \ in a warehouse, Mr Kerr.\" He asked, then to my response, \"Well, I've been teaching\
  \ public school for the last twelve years.\"  He laughed then continued, \"How would\
  \ you like to work in our SSA  in Bagram, Afghanistan? \" Not knowing what an SSA\
  \ was, I asked.  He told me it was Ass backwards.\" I laughed and he explained that\
  \ it stood for Supply Support Activity.  I asked him how much I would be compensated,\
  \ and he told me about six grand a month.  That was damn good money in comparison\
  \ to what I had been making.  I let him know that I had to discuss it with the wife.\
  \  Mr Cole promised to call back the next night at the same time.\nThis was going\
  \ to be a difficult conversation with my wife, Mary Ann, as it would mean that we\
  \ would be separated for a long period of time.  After every one hundred and twenty\
  \ days, I would get two weeks off.  The tickets home would be paid for by the company.\
  \  And at the end of the contract, I could take thirty days off. \nI was wrong.\
  \  She couldn't wait to help me pack my bags.  This should have been the first sign\
  \ of a relationship that wasn't on solid ground.  But I didn't see it.  I just knew\
  \ that I had to find some work stability.  Mr Cole called back the next evening\
  \ with his offer again, and I confirmed that I would take this job.  It was the\
  \ best offer I had ever had.  It didn't matter that I was moving to a war zone.\
  \  It didn't matter that I would be living in tents.  It didn't matter that I may\
  \ never be the same person I was at that time.  I was committed and determined to\
  \ serve my country as I never had before even when I was in the US Army Reserves.\
  \  This was a new opportunity to live the life I had never dreamed of before. TBC"
