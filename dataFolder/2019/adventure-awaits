Text: "Adventure awaits\u2026\n\nBorn in a protective Indian family, a solo traveler\
  \ isn\u2019t often encouraged let alone be a girl and even worse a girl who just\
  \ broke up with her boyfriend. \n It seemed as if it was a way of the universe to\
  \ break me from my mundane job and discover the uncharted territories, explore the\
  \ world with rose colored glasses or in my case, Spectacles!\nBetwixt convincing\
  \ my mother, an understanding father and chaotic work; I managed to fly solo to\
  \ the country of opportunity called USA. As clich\xE9 as it may sound, I was petrified\
  \ and thrilled. I even cried during the 19-hour plane ride with four hours layover\
  \ but in that small toilet of aircraft, I couldn\u2019t cry on my seat. What would\
  \ people think? \nUpon landing my nightmares came alive, my baggage was misplaced\
  \ at New York and they couldn\u2019t track it. How hard can that be? A simple black\
  \ colored bag. I should have considered my father\u2019s opinion about black bags\
  \ being ordinary but I was too excited to notice that he had a valid point and it\
  \ was too late to realize.\nRolling my eyes, I completed all the formalities for\
  \ my missing precious bag and hopped on the airport-hotel shuttle service to call\
  \ it a night. I was too tired to think straight but I did inquire about Walmart\
  \ to get fresh clothes and also inform the receptionist about my bag. I never thought\
  \ I had that in me!\nWaking up next morning, on my spreadsheet was visiting Central\
  \ Park and Statue of Liberty. I was jet-lagged, stressed and depressed, my sleep\
  \ was sporadic and I had to go shopping. That isn\u2019t fun! \nChecking with the\
  \ receptionist and getting a sorry look, I made my way to JC Penny and Macys because\
  \ it was near to the hotel and I didn\u2019t have a car to transit, I was going\
  \ to travel with the famous New York Subway and I had a two day hop on-off bus which\
  \ made my vacation in New York economical!\nThe airlines were reimbursing up to\
  \ $150 a day-for clothes and toiletries I had a plethora of emotions- I wanted to\
  \ breakdown, burst into tears because that\u2019s exactly what mature people do.\
  \ Note the heavy sarcasm!  \nOn my walk to shopping arcade, feeling of home hit\
  \ hard-the desire to go back to my life; that mundane job doesn\u2019t seem to boring\
  \ after all, I had the security, resources, people I know and a home to come back\
  \ after things got worse. \nThe typical Indian in me started to multiply the currency\
  \ exchange rate from Dollar to Indian Rupees and found everything expensive. Gingerly,\
  \ I shopped for essentials and clothes- looking at the price tag and putting a stop\
  \ on my brain the need to do math. Why doesn\u2019t my brain help me when I have\
  \ Math exam?!\nWalking back with bags in my hands to the hotel I received a call\
  \ from my family and listening to their voices made me smile and miss home even\
  \ more. When I disconnected, it hit me- I wasn\u2019t missing home but the feeling\
  \ of being home. I wasn\u2019t missing things but the thoughts, the time I spent\
  \ and most importantly, the comfort of being home. \nWhen I entered the lobby of\
  \ my hotel, I found out the 77$ I spent was wasted because they got my bag delivered\
  \ and as crazy as it sounds- I hugged the bag. Nope, I am not lying!\nI did get\
  \ a side-eye from the lady at the reception and weird looks from the other travelers\
  \ when I hugged my bag but I was ecstatic. At that moment, I didn\u2019t care what\
  \ people think of me but I know the comfort of being home was in that bag. \nI realized\
  \ it wasn\u2019t the clothes in the bag that I was missing- the clothes were parabolic\
  \ to the feeling of comfort and home. \nI didn\u2019t follow the spreadsheet that\
  \ day; I went back to the hotel, opened my bag-got a whiff of my clothes (yes, it\
  \ sounds creepy) wore my most comfortable outfit and walked out of the hotel-just\
  \ exploring the beautiful streets of New York!"
