Text: "At the beginning of 2019 I decided to departure on my first adventure to the\
  \ world\u2019s largest jungle, the Amazon. After three flights and an exhausting\
  \ trip to the northeast of Brazil, I landed on Santar\xE9m-Par\xE1, a small village\
  \ alongside Tapaj\xF3s river. The rain, the humid weather, the high temperatures,\
  \ and life abundance featured the heart of that community. A place surrounded by\
  \ an astonishing landscape, where I was about to joyfully participate in a journey\
  \ to climb the highest tree specie in the forest.\n\nEverything was set to start\
  \ the next day. A group of tree climbing instructors, nurses and some local athletes\
  \ were also ready to join the challenge and explore Amazon in the most unconventional\
  \ way. However, as we all know, nature has the power to speak louder than anyone\
  \ when it comes to making decisions. A lengthy and ferocious rainstorm unfortunately\
  \ denied our first attempt to get to the tree. And there we were, stuck in the cold\
  \ and windy campsite for, hopefully, only one more night. \n\nThe next day was cloudy,\
  \ but no rain. As ten people were quickly trying to organize their backpacks so\
  \ we could hit the road, a 1980s beetle and a convertible jeep pulled over. Yes,\
  \ those were the cars that were about to take ten people and fifteen backpacks into\
  \ a completely unknown adventure. Although the route seemed pleasant and smooth\
  \ for the first 30 minutes, we rapidly began to enter a dirt road full of bumps,\
  \ holes, and puddles \u2013 traces of the storm from the day before. \n\nAfter the\
  \ longest fifteen minutes of my life, encountering this violent and sinuous road\
  \ into the woods, the car stopped in front\u2019s of the trail we would have to\
  \ hike. The entrance of the route was an extremely slippery ravine and only one\
  \ wicked rope to hold on to. I can\u2019t deny that things were getting creepier\
  \ as I slowly walked into the mud and moist soil of this ancient jungle. However,\
  \ the scenery was more than extraordinary. I came across the most variety of trees\
  \ species I have ever seen, like chestnut trees, palm trees, pequi trees, and so\
  \ many others. \n\nAfter a few minutes in this mysterious hike, we were finally\
  \ face to face with the giant Sama\xFAma. It\u2019s enormous roots and height dictated\
  \ the power and energy of that tree. In the middle of so much flora, that tree takes\
  \ it all \u2014 forty meters of dominance, forty meters of vitality, forty meters\
  \ of pure adventure. The instructor slowly began to climb up the branches of the\
  \ tree\u2013that looked more like a tree trunk for any other tree.\n\nUltimately,\
  \ the fact that I am 5\u20193\u2019\u2019and incredibly nervous had to be disregarded,\
  \ it was my turn to climb that gigantic tree. The rope was very slippery and wet\
  \ from the rain, my hand and elbows were constantly trickling as I climbed. The\
  \ closer I got to the top, the further I was off from the ground and the scarier\
  \ it was. After a long and focused ride, I arrived at the top of the forty meters\u2019\
  \ tree. While I was still trembling and getting used to the touch of that wet wood\
  \ covered by moss and insects, the others started to work on putting our hammocks\
  \ up so we could enjoy and relax.\n\nI must say that it took me a while to feel\
  \ entirely comfortable up there. Perhaps I am still trying to understand that wild\
  \ feeling. After a while lying in the hammock, I began to feel a little more welcomed\
  \ and relaxed. Times goes by, and the sun is about to go down. We began to descend\
  \ slowly and unhurriedly, taking advantage of the last moments at the top of that\
  \ ancestral tree. Perfect timing. Our return was escorted by an incredible sunset\
  \ with sunbeams invading the forest gaps, singing and celebrating the first ascent\
  \ in a Sama\xFAma. What an adventure. It was indeed a unique experience to be at\
  \ the top of the giant Amazon and being able to contemplate all its biodiversity\
  \ from the point of view that no one has ever seen before."
