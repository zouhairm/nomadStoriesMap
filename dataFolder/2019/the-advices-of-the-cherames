Text: "The laughs, the talks, the concerns in the community the way of the rar\xE1\
  muri world to share is to listen carefully what the cherames(old people) say.  \
  \ \n\nI was in a bonfire in Creel M\xE9xico, listening amazing stories about the\
  \ advices that the cherames gave to the young rar\xE1muris.\n\nNorma told us about\
  \ the advices the cherames gave her:\n\n\u201CSometimes the older ones talk to you,\
  \ they told me many things, I remember a lot.\nI left my community as a little girl\
  \ every time I came back they gave me advices\u201D:\n\u201CAlways return to the\
  \ community, return to help\u201D.\n \n\u201CThe old rar\xE1muris are happy when\
  \ you come back, they express the joy when you help, help the children to grow up\
  \ teaching our culture and language\u201D. \n\n***\n\nBeing rar\xE1muri is to be\
  \ proud of their native origins. They live in community helping others to live better.\
  \ The first thing before anything else is to make community wherever they go and\
  \ have a strong bond with people so they can honor their spirits. \n\nThe advices\
  \ that the cherames give to the rar\xE1muris are more than words, they take them\
  \ to the party, to the dance, to talk to the deceased. So they can learn about their\
  \ culture and grow up knowing things only they know. \n\nBut sometimes the older\
  \ ones die and everything changes because the model to follow it's no longer there.\n\
  \nThe young rar\xE1muris are forgetting their origins because of the mixed cultural\
  \ background that exists in Chihuahua. Memo told us: \u201CThe white people bring\
  \ things that we didn't need, but that doesn't matters if we don't forget that we\
  \ are rar\xE1muri and we are proud of being it.\u201D \n\nThe best memory I have\
  \ about that trip was when a cherame gave me an advice:\n\n\u201CThe chabochis (white\
  \ people) sometimes are sceptical about many things the rar\xE1muris believe, because\
  \ they lost the connection with the natural world, they don't talk with the mother\
  \ earth, they forgot how to interact with the nature and that is the most valuable\
  \ we have. You have to be in connection with yourself and your environment  so you\
  \ can understand what people really needs\u201D.  \n\nSometimes we are blind at\
  \ many things because we don't want to believe in them, we lock ourselves in our\
  \ world believing that the only true thing that exists it's what we know, but there's\
  \ a world outside that screams us to be discovered, with many different people that\
  \ has multiple perspectives about life and them make us unblind."
