Text: "While looking out of my plane seat\u2019s windows, I wondered to myself, why\
  \ do musical artists or artist put in so much work and call them their own, only\
  \ to try to fit into what people want or don\u2019t want so as to be recognized?\
  \ \n\nI have traveled so many miles for this (from Singapore to Texas for SXSW Music\
  \ Festival, that is about 10 thousand miles one-way) thinking about music business,\
  \ thinking about whether I want to be in it, having to come so far. Was it because\
  \ of my curiosity of how far my own music can bring me or was it to see and feel\
  \ for myself with my own senses the new responses in new places to my works? Will\
  \ I want to continue to do so, being a big music company\u2019s or music label\u2019\
  s artist, churning songs and pushing markets of people that may buy them? Or to\
  \ be my own artist, observing from my own experiences and matters that have greatly\
  \ touched my heart, but earn not the world\u2019s recognition, but for my own need\
  \ to express them through music? \n\nSome say if you play a show to only yourself,\
  \ the art is self-serving. Some say a good show wouldn\u2019t reach anyone if you\
  \ perform it only to the four walls of your room. On the other side, music that\
  \ I find distasteful can be so well marketed that it has reached to the entire world\
  \ population and been positively accepted, to the point it has reshaped culture\
  \ and attitudes. \nIt makes me doubt - as an artist and human sometimes - is the\
  \ world even worth my genuine art and thoughts? Am I, being too stubborn, just holding\
  \ on to what I feel what music should be like, instead of refusing to follow the\
  \ new art trend, and hence becoming irrelevant? But do I want to hop on to the trends,\
  \ singing things I may not like, performing like a monkey trained for the circus?\
  \ \n\nI put my seatbelt on and at this moment of my deep thoughts and sighs, I\u2019\
  ve landed on an answer."
