Text: It was all unplanned and mostly indestined.. But it happened anyway.. This trip
  gave out my soul a experience of life.. It started pretty bad because we came out
  of our house our prototype of safety to this world.. We lied and got out of pur
  house at 6am where roads were stranded and all dark.. We got on to our ride and
  reached station in hurt and prayed all while that whatever we (me and my sister)
  were doing was right.. We met our frnds who were all sharing fussy ness of their
  homes but we were all disappointed anyway we got on to our train and sat.. And started
  the 9 day long journey to "GOAAAAA" the place of freedom and friendship.. After
  1 and half of restlessness we got on our bus and landed into our hotel which gave
  us relief that we finally reached here.. So the very same night at 3 we went to
  beach and got ourselves wet to capture all feels.. 2nd day started pretty amazing
  with sunrise and amazing pictures.. We went to beach again bcus it was my 1st time..
  We roamed around and experiencing peace at night we went from north to south goa
  with 16 people at 2 am in our scooty.. Shouting our heart out at streets, Which
  was amazing.. The next day it was all about goa feel of partying.. Pool party happened
  pretty well.. Then...
