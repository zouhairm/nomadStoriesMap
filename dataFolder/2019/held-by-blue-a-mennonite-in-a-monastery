Text: "The step to disembark from the tram was higher than I expected. I stumbled\
  \ onto a concrete platform and found my feet standing in a place that only weeks\
  \ before would have been lightyears from my imagination.\nI looked up. For once\
  \ I didn\u2019t need my chauffeur to hold a sign with my name for us to find each\
  \ other. She must have recognized me by my held-breath, wide-eyed frantic turning\
  \ in circles  \u2014 taking in the impossible perfection and complete foreignness\
  \ of the green mountains the Swiss Jura. The landscape nothing like the Amish and\
  \ Mennonite barns dotting the flat plains of Indiana I came from.\nI recognized\
  \ her because of the habit she wore. A blue nun\u2019s habit, a sort of cornflower\
  \ blue, or bluet in the German-accented French I would eventually learn to speak\
  \ confidently here. \nThe sister led me from the tram platform, down a lane flourishing\
  \ with bougainvillea. I appreciated her lack of questions beyond a lilting English:\
  \ \u201Chow was your journey?\u201D I was relieved this Sister Veronika did not\
  \ ask me how I came there, or why, because I was sure I couldn\u2019t yet put it\
  \ into words. I walked and I was glad for the only sound being the embarrassingly\
  \ loud clack-clack-clack of my suitcase wheels. \nWhat was I, a Gay, semi-spiritual,\
  \ rejected Mennonite doing stepping into a silent monastery in Switzerland? Because\
  \ after I was kicked out of my home, a 92-year-old Swiss Mennonite - the equally\
  \ shunned but innocent widow of our community\u2019s most notorious sexual predator\
  \ - had taken me in, made some calls on my behalf and found me a place to be safe\
  \ for a little while. That place turned out to be Switzerland, and a monastery nonetheless.\
  \ I would work in the garden, a little in the kitchen, in exchange for my meals\
  \ and safety.\nWe passed a split rail fence framing a cherry tree heavy with the\
  \ fruit that grows well at these altitudes. Sister Catherine would break her vow\
  \ of silence only days later over that tree, screaming at me to come down when I\
  \ climbed to the top to pick the last of the fruit, clueless to the fact that cherrywood\
  \ is notoriously weak and deadly to climbers.\nThat about embodies those first months\
  \ at the monastery: I was embarrassingly loud, stumbling and exacerbating for everyone.\
  \ There was no love-at-first-sight for that cornflower blue, for the cherry trees\
  \ and rose gardens, the chapel in an old barn, or even the cool, clear Swiss fountains.\
  \ I found the towering landscape threatening, unsettling to my American midwestern\
  \ spirit.\nNow I believe it was those mountains that finally allowed me to grieve.\
  \ They enclosed me in a way I had never felt in flat cornfields. The mountains held\
  \ me in, whispered it would be ok, and just as I started to feel the mountains holding\
  \ me, the sisters did, too.  Forty or so interchanging sets of blue-clad arms. Old.\
  \ Young. Some so demented I\u2019m not sure they knew who I was, but they held me\
  \ nonetheless. If I close my eyes, I can still feel the cornflower-blue fabric against\
  \ my cheeks each time I shake with sobs. \nIt was only after the tears that I looked\
  \ up and found the mountains a comfort. I discovered the monastery was feet from\
  \ a royal blue lake. I learned to dive in Lake Neuch\xE2tel - as deep as I could\
  \ go, letting the water hem me in.\nI\u2019ve returned to Switzerland, and to those\
  \ beautiful blue sisters, three times. Each time, I\u2019ve found myself grieving:\
  \ for children lost too soon, relationships altered forever. This last time, I didn\u2019\
  t think I had anything to grieve.  Only later I realized I was there to grieve the\
  \ grieving itself - to fully recognize the abundance of the mountains and lakes,\
  \ of monastery kitchen gardens, the oldest sisters\u2019 peeling laughter (silence\
  \ be damned at 90!), and the graces of my very own life.\nThis last time, I climbed\
  \ the cherry tree again \u2014 when Sister Catherine wasn\u2019t looking. It was\
  \ July, and the birds should have taken anything that was neglected in the June\
  \ harvest,  yet up there I found two perfect blue-black fruits. Nothing ever tasted\
  \ more like home."
