Text: "Rooted to the spot in the middle of the chaos, I watched the carnival unfold.\
  \ A giant ant was paraded through the seething crowds, the sound of drums enveloped\
  \ me, and a haze of flour hung heavy in the air. Crammed against people on every\
  \ side, suddenly I felt a hand pull my coat collar away from my neck and shove a\
  \ handful of something brown into the gap. A sense of horror filled me - what I\u2019\
  d thought was a handful of dirt turned out to be ants, soaked in vinegar and stinging\
  \ everywhere they could reach. Welcome to the carnival at Laza, Galicia.\n\nThe\
  \ carnival is so ancient no-one\u2019s really sure where it comes from. Its origins\
  \ are widely debated, but are believed to have roots in both Celtic and Roman traditions.\
  \ Celebrated to mark the start of Lent, it\u2019s one huge blow-out, one last, glorious\
  \ lapse into carnal and violent desires before the traditionally restrained and\
  \ ascetic six weeks before Easter. Carnivals are held the world over, but none quite\
  \ like this one.\n\nOur group arrived early in the morning, droopy and tired after\
  \ a long drive. We came prepared with bin bags so as not to mess up our clothes:\
  \ a piece of advice I thought was exaggerated until I saw the baths full of mud\
  \ dragged into the town square. An unearthly calm reverberated through the square,\
  \ all sound muffled by mist in this mountain town. Then someone gave a cry, and\
  \ all hell broke loose. The ferrapada, or mud battle, had begun. Quickly descending\
  \ into all-out war, people soaked clothes in the mud and hurled them at each other.\
  \ There were no teams or sides, at least not to my eye - the chaos was completely\
  \ random, and completely wonderful. Unlucky warriors were picked up and dunked in\
  \ the bathtubs whole, while I was lucky to come out with a bit of mud between my\
  \ teeth.\n\nWeaving down the sloping side streets of the town, we\u2019d been warned\
  \ to keep to the side. One of the most iconic characters from the Galician carnival\
  \ traditions is the peliqueiro. Wearing elaborate, decadent, ruffled costumes, these\
  \ authoritarian figures run down the streets in single file, hitting anyone who\
  \ stands in their path with thorny branches. Wearing masks painted with a sinister\
  \ smile, they felt like ancient foot soldiers from the region\u2019s wilder past,\
  \ transported to the present to remind people just where they\u2019d come from.\
  \ During the Francoist dictatorship, this tradition in particular was clamped down\
  \ upon. While it still carried on in secret, the peliqueiro became an important\
  \ symbol of rural Galician identity against the one united Spain espoused by the\
  \ government at the time.\n\nEdging along the streets - just in case - we rejoined\
  \ the rest of the group milling around in the town square, fortifying ourselves\
  \ with famously strong licor cafe and pulpo (octopus). People poured into the square,\
  \ dressed up in costume and ready for the night ahead. As the square filled up to\
  \ boiling point, packed with people, a hush fell, and I wondered what was going\
  \ to happen. Flour began to fall out of the sky like rain, while a statue of a giant\
  \ ant was borne solemnly along, accompanied by thousands of ants in barrels. The\
  \ ants themselves had been soaked in vinegar to get them nicely cross, and handfuls\
  \ were hurled at the crowd - and shoved down the coats of unfortunate British tourists.\
  \ Amazed, aghast and appalled all at once, I decided to give myself up to the night,\
  \ and danced.\n\nSo\u2026 why? Why ants? Why flour? Why thorny branches? Noone really\
  \ knows - but that\u2019s the beauty of it. To truly enjoy it, you have to surrender\
  \ yourself. Surrender all rational thoughts, surrender all \u2018common sense\u2019\
  , and just enjoy the excuse to run wild. Laza\u2019s carnival is a living, breathing\
  \ reminder of Galicia\u2019s tangled roots. \n\nAnd yes, I did get all the ants\
  \ out of my hair. Eventually."
