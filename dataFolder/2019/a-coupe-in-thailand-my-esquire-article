Text: "The Royal Thai army has officially declared its coup d'\xE9tat, which, as of\
  \ yesterday, was not a coup d'\xE9tat, but the power was seized from the government\
  \ in every real way. I live in Phuket, which is an island province in the south.\
  \ A population of roughly half a million, nearly 20 percent of us are expats.\n\n\
  Phuket's infamous Bangla Road, one of the largest sex tourism hubs in Southeast\
  \ Asia, has been shut down. Effective immediately, curfew hours are from 10 p.m.\
  \ to 5 in the morning, says the provincial government. The largest city, Patong\u2014\
  the nightlife capital, knee-deep in sex tourism and debauchery\u2014is all shut\
  \ down.\n\nThe question remains: The multimillion dollar sex tourism industry, the\
  \ ladyboys, the go-go dancers\u2014where will they go? \n\nSo far in Phuket, only\
  \ one police checkpoint has been set up. Schools are closed for tomorrow. In Bangkok,\
  \ the military has taken an increased role. Soldiers have set up checkpoints in\
  \ full combat gear, a scene reminiscent of my time serving in Iraq. I served five\
  \ years in the United States Army before this, doing a combat tour, then working\
  \ for a private military firm. What first became a way to ride out tax exemptions\
  \ later became a passion for combat sports.\n\nSome of the world's best combat sport\
  \ athletes are training at Phuket Top Team. A strange cabal of fighters from around\
  \ the world are now corralled to their own residences for the night.\n\nThe Ibiza-style\
  \ beach clubs of Koh Phangan are silent. No longer is Pitbull pronouncing his own\
  \ name ad nauseam. Nightlife tourism in Thailand has come to a screeching halt.\
  \ In a country renowned for its all-night vice and fun, all is quiet.\n\n image\n\
  The backpacker hotspot of Khao Sahn Road is now dead. Thousands of English gap year\
  \ students are finally getting a real cultural and governmental lesson instead of\
  \ drinking cheap alcohol and burning away their parents' money. They are now forced\
  \ to face (or at least actively evade) the political reality they've persistently\
  \ ignored\u2014one that makes the cost of living so cheap at the expense of any\
  \ true sense of order.\n\nNineteen total coups and counting in Thailand, this place\
  \ holds the world record for deposing governments. And to its credit, Thailand is\
  \ the only Southeast Asian Nation that has never been colonized by a European Power.\
  \ Thais pride themselves on this, and perhaps they see government overthrows as\
  \ par for the course in the \"sabai sabai\" lifestyle (\"relax, relax,\" it means)\
  \ of Thailand. This marks the 11th successful military coup, not including other\
  \ failed attempts since 1932.\n\nThe biggest inconvenience for me, an aspiring fighter\
  \ who has relocated to Thailand for guts and glory, is all of the closed street\
  \ food vendors at night. We are forced to remain in our residences. Meanwhile, the\
  \ crime syndicates, nightlife operators and those running in between them are losing\
  \ money fast. With the curfew in tact, they are not, and something has to pop.\n\
  \nSexpats are crying. I am stuck hungry in this bungalow in the jungle.\n\nSource:\
