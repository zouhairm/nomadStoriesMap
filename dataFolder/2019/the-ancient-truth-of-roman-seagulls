Text: "The sun was golden in this city; of a leathery orange and a decadently pretentious\
  \ intensity, painted on a deep blue sky, it poured its floating colors onto the\
  \ brownstones, the orange trees and the sparkling water fountains. The traffic was\
  \ load, washing over all the other noises in rustling sound waves, over the screams\
  \ of the seagulls and the voluminous conversations, this whole city became a humming\
  \ in the background, the white noise of rain constantly pouring down the windows\
  \ of everybody\u2019s mind.  \nI spent my nights with other exchange students in\
  \ crowded restaurants and bars, carafes of red wine and water glasses on wooden\
  \ tables between us, we talked about parties we have been to and cities we wanted\
  \ to see, about sunsets on oceans on the other side of the world and gelaterias\
  \ just around the corner. Sometimes we went on, when the bars closed their shutters\
  \ with a bang, went on into steamy clubs and joined people on the dancefloor, whose\
  \ lips sparkled from salivary sweat and alcohol, and we stayed until we could watch\
  \ the sunrise from one of the city\u2019s hills. Dozing off and starring up into\
  \ the red and golden sky we sang songs in Italian, gossiped about people we barely\
  \ knew and passed water bottle of wine we weren\u2019t supposed to drink anymore.\
  \ When the city turned silent for just a few seconds, we got ear-piercingly loud.\
  \ \nA little bit hungover I forced myself to wake up early and spent most days aimlessly\
  \ wandering through the narrow streets, which looked so similar that they blurred\
  \ in my mind, and stumbling upon squares where tourists gathered to take the same\
  \ pictures they found on Instagram the day before; those secret-tips displayed and\
  \ praised in travel blogs and travel guides, equipped with English signs and marked\
  \ on maps by colored stars. For two weeks I had stayed here, in the city where the\
  \ light is floaty and the coffee pitch-black, two weeks on stony squares and ancient\
  \ halls, and I still got lost whenever I turned around a corner. Too big was the\
  \ city and too narrow its streets, too similar its beauty and too overwhelmed my\
  \ mind. I saw too much to comprehend and too little to defend letting myself fall\
  \ exhaustedly, onto walls or benches, meadows or expensive chairs in coffee bars,\
  \ while ambitious tourists hurried along past me, crossing off their sightseeing-to-do-lists\
  \ with triumphing eyes glowing in their sunburnt faces. The black coffee burned\
  \ in my stomach, when my eyes followed them with envy. It was spring, but the light\
  \ was already warm on my skin.\nI was sitting on one of the golden walls, one of\
  \ the many where groups of tourists passed by to take selfies, making each other\
  \ laugh in languages I didn\u2019t understand, before they went on dissolving back\
  \ into the white noise. An open book in my lap I overlooked the city; motionless,\
  \ soundless, like an antic stature, I let my eyes follow a seagull, jumping nervously\
  \ from table to table trying to catch some panino crumbs or the abandoned pieces\
  \ of a cornetto without being caught by the angry waiter. During this short moment\
  \ of peace in the city that is almost never quiet I realized that all the tourists\
  \ were like this seagull; on the hurry, on the run, like I had been so many times\
  \ before, trying to catch as many crumbs as possible before they are forced to leave\
  \ again. But I was not. I would be here, in this golden city for months, I could\
  \ buy a warm, fresh-from-the-oven cornetto whenever I was hungry, instead of voraciously\
  \ shoving down my throat whatever I could grasp. \n\u201CI\u2019ll stay home tonight,\u201D\
  \ I told myself, closing my eyes, bathing my face in the warm spring air, and took\
  \ a deep breath. The city suddenly seemed quiet to me. The next day I chucked crumbs\
  \ of my breakfast to the squawking seagulls and sipped overpriced cappuccino in\
  \ the midday sun. They needed them more than I did."
