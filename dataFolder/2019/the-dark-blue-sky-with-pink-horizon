Text: "The white mist followed us to the resort as we walked back from the village,\
  \ just when the sun was setting in. We were told that the landscape ofTerai were\
  \ one of the best ones in the country by our resort manager, especially during the\
  \ evenings. At that moment, I almost spat \u201CNo.\u201D For me, the best evenings\
  \ meant silhouetted houses, stacked like cards with pitch black gallies in between.\
  \ It meant sitting on a stone slab in a falcha with wooden beams and staring at\
  \ the people passing by. The best evenings were those in Durbar Squares of Kathmandu\
  \ Valley, where you would be staring at the mighty palaces, always surrounded by\
  \ the locals \u2013 young and old, alone and in a group, quiet and noisy.\n\nThis\
  \ was my first trip to Chitwan, near National Park and I was staying at a resort\
  \ in Kasara, right near the community buffer zone. I was here for the weekend and\
  \ my package included a village walk to learn about the Tharu villages nearby, Elephant\
  \ ride for the next morning, canoeing in the evening and a short jungle walk. I\
  \ was excited to be here, part of me wishing to get the glimpse of Rhinos and Tigers\
  \ (yes, the impossible dreams). And this was my first night.\n\nAs we walked around\
  \ the village in Patiyani, the surroundings amazed me with the yellow fields full\
  \ of mustards. The traditional houses of mud and thatched roof were decorated with\
  \ traditional murals and instruments used by the villagers for fishing. We walked\
  \ till the end of the road where the elephants of the resort were kept and I managed\
  \ to catch a glimpse of a mountain which was pretty far away from the place we were.\
  \ And at that moment, I got the sense of what our manager meant when he said the\
  \ view in Terai is one of the best. \u201CYou can see far and wide from any particular\
  \ place here\u201D he\u2019d said before we started the walk, \u201Cthere are no\
  \ mountains or hills to block the view you see.\u201D\n\nThe mist had started to\
  \ develop right when we had decided to return back. It was also slowly getting darker\
  \ while the sky was slowly turning into pink. The closer we were to the resort,\
  \ the whiter the yellow fields were turning into. It was as if the magical mist\
  \ was following us, trying to engulf everything around. I could see the faraway\
  \ fields, already submerged inside the mist. And right there, when we reached the\
  \ resort, I finally understood what the manager meant. I was looking at a dark blue\
  \ sky with a tiny star twinkling and a crescent moon above a pink horizon which\
  \ was followed by dark silhouette of fields far and wide. And this was basically\
  \ the best twilight I ever came across in my life."
