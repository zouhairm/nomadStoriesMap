Text: "In late March of 2018 my husband and I embarked on a belated honeymoon to Japan.\n\
  \nOur 10-day trip had been planned for a couple of weeks before the cherry blossoms\
  \ were supposed to bloom, but this hadn\u2019t occurred to us until we had already\
  \ booked our flight. We arrived late evening and made the long subway trip to our\
  \ Airbnb in Meguro, Tokyo. When we exited the station there was a light rain and\
  \ we navigated through the wet of the windy back streets to our temporary home.\n\
  \nWe woke the next day ready to explore our neighborhood and the city. After happily\
  \ stumbling upon a bakery a block down from our place, we decided to explore more.\
  \ We came across Onibus Coffee (I\u2019d read about it but hadn\u2019t set it as\
  \ a destination), where we each had a welcome cup of caffeine on the coffee shop\u2019\
  s cozy second floor space, overlooking hundreds of perfectly parked bikes. With\
  \ an extra jump to our step, we ventured on.\n\nA few more turns here and there\
  \ took us back to Yamate Dori where we crossed over the busy commercial/residential\
  \ street. In less than a minute we found ourselves by the Meguro River. We\u2019\
  d passed the same river the night before, but tired in the wet dark hadn\u2019t\
  \ noticed it.\n\nThe river is lined by trees and when we realized what we were looking\
  \ at, we both lit up with surprise. We hadn\u2019t expected to find the cherry blossoms\
  \ beginning to bloom. There, before our eyes, entirely unexpected, we saw the puffy\
  \ whites of the flowers six or so days before their peak bloom. We smiled to each\
  \ other, to the river, and to the trees whose flowers would soon brighten the streets\
  \ of Tokyo.\n\nOver the next few days we explored the neighborhoods of the city.\
  \ We enjoyed a tea ceremony at Sakurai in Shibuya and watched in amazement as hundreds\
  \ of people traversed the crosswalk at Shibuya Crossing. In Asakusa we walked through\
  \ the rows of vendor stalls selling snacks, sweets, and gifts. We visited the temple\
  \ and delighted in the strong flavored Number 7 matcha ice cream at Suzukien Asakusa.\
  \ Meandering through the streets of Harajuku, we found ourselves at Deus Ex Machina\
  \ Caf\xE9 where we treated ourselves to a refreshing cocktail. A short walk from\
  \ Ebisu Station, we found ourselves in the bustling yokocho (back alleys) and sat\
  \ down in one of the many izakayas (informal pub/tapas bar) where a regular treated\
  \ us to shochu drinks and one of his favorite pork dishes.\n\nIn order to see more\
  \ of Japan, we purchased a JR Pass and headed to Osaka. We climbed the steps of\
  \ Osaka Castle and viewed the city from hundreds of feet above. In the evening we\
  \ walked the neon lit Tonbori River Walk of Dotonbori where we ate the infamous\
  \ takoyaki (fried octopus balls). A few streets down we happened upon a corner bar\
  \ and spent the rest of the night eating and drinking in the company of the owner\
  \ and his boisterous friends.\n\nOur next stop was Nara where we walked through\
  \ Nara Park, feeding deer-crackers to the deer that roamed freely. We took pictures\
  \ of the temples and bought gifts in the Nara National Museum of Art. Always ready\
  \ to indulge in matcha ice cream, we shared a cone topped with a single deer-shaped\
  \ cookie. \n\nIn Kyoto we continued to sample food throughout the day, and walked\
  \ through the historic Gion district, the birthplace of geishas. We visited the\
  \ Yasaka Shrine where we threw money for the gods, shook the bell, and each made\
  \ a small prayer. At night, we found a restaurant a few doors down from our hostel\
  \ and ate enough for a family four.\n\nThroughout our travels we watched the course\
  \ of the cherry blossom season. We witnessed the beauty of the trees in full bloom,\
  \ like many things only which the naked eye can fully embrace. As our travels came\
  \ to an end, the petals fell and graced the pavement of Japan, signaling the end\
  \ of cherry blossom season."
