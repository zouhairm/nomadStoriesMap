Text: "A medieval town off the Costa Brava once serving as the point of transfer to\
  \ Barcelona for budget airlines, Girona stands her ground comfortably through the\
  \ changes she has witnessed over time. Surrounded by old city walls, a mosaic of\
  \ carrers - or town squares, connects a network of stone alleys and passageways.\n\
  \nThese are the streets in which giants, human towers, and fire breathing dragons\
  \ are paraded through in festivity; where once a year, a giant fly is rolled on\
  \ a trolley intended to be swatted away by costumed revellers\u2014but that\u2019\
  s another story. On the day to day, it is a calm city in which these narrow streets\
  \ see a varied influx of visitors passing through on the daily pulse of tourism\
  \ to visit local shops and eateries on their way to or from the Catalonian capital.\n\
  \  \nKnowing I have only thirty minutes before we\u2019re meant to hit the road\
  \ again, I make my way to a cafe I used to frequent when I moved into my Spanish\
  \ apartment in an adjacent carrer only one year before. \n\nI had returned to say\
  \ goodbye. I didn\u2019t know if I would be back again, and we had ground to cover.\
  \ A car full of people and plans all eager to get ahead on the long drive east towards\
  \ the lesser known shores of the Adriatic coastline.\n\nComforted by its seemingly\
  \ ever present stance off the corner of Pla\xE7a del Vi, El Caf\xE8 breathes in\
  \ simplicity on the inhale and the rhythms of daily life on the exhale. Where some\
  \ locales survive on the constant buzz of espresso and quick conversation, this\
  \ cafe offers a space to reflect on a quick stride. \n\nIn the short time I am here,\
  \ it is everything I remember it to be and more. I order my cortado and sit down\
  \ to observe the local morning ritual I have chosen to impose on today. With a patterned\
  \ tiled floor of rusty red accents, the interior does not try to be anything other\
  \ than a functional space of encounter; a place to have a drink and grab a quick\
  \ bite.\n\nThe day is prepped as orders slowly trickle in, the two bar attendants\
  \ swiftly achieving multiple tasks at once. Regulars enter and order their coffee\
  \ before taking a seat, joining me as observers. \n\nFresh baguettes are brought\
  \ in and olive oil is rubbed on the empty sandwich cut open. Jamon is sliced with\
  \ vigour on the meat slicer in shop. These three simple ingredients are perfectly\
  \ paired with my second cortado of the half hour I have given myself to reminisce.\n\
  \nThe freshness of these entrepans are maintained by the frequency of orders and\
  \ the subsistent method of replacing only what is missing in the small display case\
  \ on the counter.\n\nFlipping through local newspapers, we are all well aware of\
  \ each other, while keeping completely to ourselves. It is a movement, almost choreographed,\
  \ allowing the twenty or so seats to fill and empty as regulars take a momentary\
  \ pause before the rest of the city wakes. We are eyeing each other, and sizing\
  \ up our neighbours, sometimes a subtle nod is offered in recognition that we are\
  \ connected in the silence of this daily ritual. There is a certain comfort to be\
  \ found in sharing this morning with complete strangers.\n\nI get up to pay my tab,\
  \ glancing at the chalkboard menu on the wall, wondering why I had never stopped\
  \ in for an evening vermut or glass of wine when I lived here. It is good to leave\
  \ a place tempted to experience more and with that I exit feeling satisfied at having\
  \ paid a favourite a visit.\n\nBack on the road we go."
