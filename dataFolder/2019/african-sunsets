Text: "June 10th 2018. It had been an effortful day of travelling. It had taken seventeen\
  \ hours and three planes to get me from home in Chesterfield, England to Utende,\
  \ a tiny village on the island of Mafia, just off the coast of Dar es Salaam. But\
  \ I had made it, I was in Africa, my home for the next three months. \n\nThis was\
  \ an experience like nothing I had ever attempted before. As an intern on our humble\
  \ camp I would be living with barely the basics. With no running water, no mains\
  \ electricity, and a hole in the ground for a toilet, my first impressions were\
  \ something along the lines of 'what the hell have I got myself in for'. In an attempt\
  \ to distract myself I took to unpacking my essentials. Without a lightbulb it was\
  \ too dark to unpack inside the banda so instead I knelt on the sand beside my bag,\
  \ occasionally flicking away ants that climbed onto me. \n\nSix thirty in the evening\
  \ and the sun dropped from the sky. It was too early. In June in the UK I had been\
  \ used to the sun setting after eight, but there I was, still unpacking my belongings,\
  \ yet to have dinner, and the day was calling time. \n\nI had to cease unpacking\
  \ to take it all in. The sun was colossal, the sunset was artwork, the sky was on\
  \ fire. And then the fire was extinguished. Twilight does not exist in Tanzania,\
  \ it was night time in an instant. I had to stop unpacking altogether as I couldn't\
  \ see anymore, I climbed into bed, unsure of what to do with myself. Three months\
  \ here. I stared at the calendar on my phone considering the number of weeks I had\
  \ ahead of me, the number of showers I would take and meals I would eat, the number\
  \ of sunsets I would see. \n\n\nSeptember 11th 2018. The car was bumping around\
  \ on the dirt tracks so much I was definitely getting bruises. I didn't care. I\
  \ was deliriously happy from the scene that had just unfolded. A solo male lion\
  \ walking right towards me. I swear we'd made eye contact. If it weren't for my\
  \ Landcruiser I would have probably been his dinner and yet I found it all so exciting.\
  \ In the middle of the Serengeti it was just him, me, and Hozer, my game-driver.\
  \ For my last night in Tanzania, I could not have asked for a more intimate encounter.\n\
  \nQuite honestly, the reason we had been so lucky to see the lion was because we\
  \ were breaking park rules. It was 18:05, and no one is supposed to drive after\
  \ six, but our safari camp was still hours away and we couldn\u2019t exactly stop\
  \ in the middle of the plains. \n\nAfter pausing for the lion we continued to our\
  \ camp, one bump at a time. I always wondered how Hozer knew where we were going.\
  \ There's no signs in the Serengeti, nothing particularly distinct, but every so\
  \ often we'd reach a crossroads and he would just know where to go as if it was\
  \ instinct, as if the whole park was mapped out in his brain. \n\nTen minutes passed\
  \ since our lion encounter and it became apparent why there is a rule of no driving\
  \ after six. The light in the sky was rapidly reducing, we would soon be in complete\
  \ darkness. Within seconds, the sun was low in the sky. We were driving north, and\
  \ so the spectacle was perfectly positioned out of my left window. I snapped a quick\
  \ picture. By then I must have had over fifty photos of firing African sunsets,\
  \ but they were all so compelling, I could never resist. \n\nJust as always, by\
  \ half-past the show was over and we were plunged into the dark. I prayed Hozer\
  \ really did have a mental map of our way home, or we were at risk of being trapped\
  \ out with the predators. With nothing left to see, I closed my eyes and embraced\
  \ the final stage of my bumpy journey."
