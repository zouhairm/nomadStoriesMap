Text: "When I decided to go to Ireland, to the town where my grandmother grew up,\
  \ I didn\u2019t expect to wide up in a river. Like, literally inside the river,\
  \ water up to my waist, and a broad smile stretching over my chattering teeth. \n\
  This was the coolest adventure (both literally and figuratively) of my trip. The\
  \ day started early, a houseful of people bursting around a space made for three\
  \ inhabitants but stretched past capacity to hold nine. We gathered our supplies,\
  \ bumping and running into each other, to find whatever we hoped was needed, loaded\
  \ up the cars and piled in. We drove for about an hour, playing cards in the back\
  \ of the rental car to entertain the younger ones, and attempted not to lose them\
  \ as we wound through tiny roads, on the \u2018wrong\u2019 side of the road. Our\
  \ party spilled out at the top of a rock-strewn hill with a broad coastal view on\
  \ one side, a thick wall of greenery on the other. Above, the sky was looking less\
  \ than agreeable, but spirits were bright as I proceeded to meet sixteen more people\
  \ that I was supposedly related to. I was promptly handed a wetsuit and a pair of\
  \ water shoes and was told to suit up. Astonishment rippled through us Canadians,\
  \ however shrugging my shoulders I did as told, seeing no other option than to go\
  \ with this odd flow. The oldest boy took lead, with a parade of people aged as\
  \ old as nineteen to as young as six behind him. The adults were told to stay behind\
  \ to be led in a separate direction, with cameras strung around their necks. \u201C\
  Are you ready for some bouldering?\u201D the lofty boy called out. I guess I was\
  \ as ready as I could be, as I still barely knew what was going on. As we fought\
  \ our way through lush bushes, I pulled up my hair, despite the nip of wind at the\
  \ back of my neck; I had spotted a river and realized what my upcoming location\
  \ would be. I\u2019m still unsure whether this a real sport or not, but it was explained\
  \ that we would be going up the river, the middle of the river mind you, clambering\
  \ over boulders and sliding over rocks. Climbing in, I quickly became thankful for\
  \ the gear that I was supplied with because it was damn cold in the water and even\
  \ colder above it. I could feel goosebumps rising on my uncovered skin, and the\
  \ suit swelled as water flooded in. Then the sky started to drizzle: those grey\
  \ clouds were on the move. We maneuvered our way, person by person, each taking\
  \ turns pulling or pushing others, or being pushed and pulled up the rocks ourselves.\
  \ This may not have been a traditional \u2018Irish\u2019 experience but I realized\
  \ that relying on both strangers and family was as much a part of the culture as\
  \ the sheep and the rolling green hills. I could feel the bruises starting to form\
  \ beneath my skin and my palms were raw from the temperature and gripping at the\
  \ crevices in the rocks. We were almost to the top when the rain stopped, and I\
  \ decided to turn around. My pains were forgotten with the awe of the view. It resembled\
  \ a tropical destination: the valley between the mountains we were climbing smoothing\
  \ out into the expanse of ocean, the clouds had moved passed us glittered in the\
  \ distance above the ocean, and closer, we could see a bridge where our \u2018paparazzi\u2019\
  \ waited, cheering us on and snapping pictures as we slashed through the natural\
  \ pools. In each direction, my vision was flooded by that emerald colour, and laughter\
  \ broke out when we saw a gang of mountain goats whom we tried to emulate. We continued\
  \ on, and not being slowed down by the awkward course of the river, the adults met\
  \ us at the top where I was told to push my bravery again. \u201CJUMP!\u201D they\
  \ hollered. \nAnd there I was, on the coast of Ireland, cliff jumping with my new\
  \ family, mountain goats, and a storm at my side learning to embrace the bold and\
  \ the boulders."
