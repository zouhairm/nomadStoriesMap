Text: "Marrakech was the choice destination in May 2017 to whizz my mother off in\
  \ celebration of her 60th birthday. She was thrilled. I was thrilled. Travels with\
  \ friends sent me hopping across European cities \u2013 the last being Rome in all\
  \ its grandeur. City bike ride tours gliding through old towns and new towns would\
  \ be swapped temporarily for a city in North Africa dubbed \u2018The Red City\u2019\
  , with stamps of an ancient imperial past.  I was informed by my Google weather\
  \ app that we could expect a hot stay, with temperatures reaching well into the\
  \ mid-30s.\n\nNo sooner did we land in Marrakech Menara airport were we taken to\
  \ our boutique hotel by a handy driver and welcomed with freshly squeezed watermelon\
  \ juice. Exploration of Marrakech commenced right away. My mother and I surveyed\
  \ the surrounding area. Offline maps on my mobile phone would be our guide. What\
  \ could we expect from the city? We had flown in at the start of Ramadan. What lay\
  \ ahead and what memories would we look back on in a week from now?\n\nIt was Tuesday\
  \ morning. My itinerary said today was \u2018market tour\u2019 day. After breakfast,\
  \ a 30-minute walk in the 32-degree heat would ensue to Jemaa el-Fnaa \u2013 Marrakesh\u2019\
  s bustling market square in the Medina quarter.\n\n\u2018Look!\u2019, My mother\
  \ shouted as she pointed to an old Moroccan man sitting on a worn red mat armed\
  \ with a wooden flute. In front of him, raised from the ground, a black and grey\
  \ speckled cobra swayed from side to side following intently the emerging sounds\
  \ of the flute. We had arrived in the market square. We were ready to begin the\
  \ afternoon\u2019s adventure.\n\nWe circled the square, admiring the array of goods\
  \ being sold by stall keepers but that was just the start. To our left lay a pathway\
  \ untouched by the searing heat as the afternoon emerged. Prior research before\
  \ the travel brought my attention to the famed \u2018souks of Marrakech\u2019. The\
  \ pathway would mark our ascent into this famed space. This was to be, the leap\
  \ into the unknown. \"It\u2019s mad\", a friend back in London who\u2019d graced\
  \ Marrakech before me \nhumorously told me. \"Prepare yourself.\"\n\nNothing could\
  \ have prepared my mother and I for the cool air that hit our arms and the small\
  \ rays of sun poking through the caverns. All round on each side were stall holders,\
  \ Moroccan men, some commanding huge stalls, others but small cracks in between\
  \ with everything from food spices, incense, perfumes, ornate ceramics, sandals,\
  \ kaftans, and scores of leather bags. We could hear raised voices and raucous chants\
  \ on either side in a bid to entice us to stop and buy. For my mother, her eyes\
  \ spoke of a dream come true. Having had a penchant for leather goods since her\
  \ youth, she took on the Moroccan sellers haggling away to drive down prices reminiscent\
  \ of the years we spent living in Ghana, West Africa. \u201CYour mother, she strong;\
  \ she like a Berber woman\u201D, I heard repeatedly as we moved through the leather\
  \ stalls \u2013 bags perched so high on walls they required long wooden sticks with\
  \ hooks to bring down. The dizzying pathways had us circling some souks two or three\
  \ times. Some sellers attempted to try their luck once more; keeping hold of the\
  \ bags once admired, hoping my mother would have a change of heart and accept their\
  \ reduced offer.\n\nI soon looked up for wooden signs with white paint that pointed\
  \ to the exit of the maze that was the Moroccan souks. Determination led us back\
  \ to that familiar pathway we saw at the start. The sun shone bright and with the\
  \ cool damp air behind us, we put on our sunglasses to face the bright hot weather\
  \ once again.\n\nIt is safe to say that my mother and I emerged victorious armed\
  \ with the spoils of our conquest; two leather backpacks, one leather handbag, a\
  \ small wooden camel, a pair of leather slippers, two beautifully hand-painted ceramic\
  \ bowls, and a bag of fresh olives \u2013 my mother\u2019s favourite snack. \n\n\
  \u201CThat was great\u201D, my mother retorted with a huge smile on her face. \u201C\
  I\u2019d like to do that again.\""
