Text: "Chiloe\u2019s tourism brochures make good stories for stormy nights. The island\
  \ is as inseparable from Pacific fog as the mythology that surrounds it. \n\nMainland\
  \ Chileans whisper of brujas, witches, trickster dwarves, and houses teetering on\
  \ stilts. \n\nMarie and I had come for something a bit less supernatural: penguins.\
  \ \n\nToday, however, the island had other plans.\n\n\u201CA Minga!\u201D Marie\
  \ stares. I follow her gaze into the shadows of the bus station. \n\nA paper flyer\
  \ is tapped to the wall. Had we stumbled upon Chiloe\u2019s most famous legend?\n\
  \n\u201CIt\u2019s today...\u201D\n\nLike a spell, the penguins vanish. \n\nMoments\
  \ later, we burst into to the tourism office in the port of Ancud.\n\n\u201CExcuse\
  \ me, where\u2019s the Minga?\u201D \n\nThe man shrugs. He suggests we ask around\
  \ the town square. \n\nMarie and I circle the plaza\u2019s empty stone fountain\
  \ talking to locals. We get more shrugs.\n\nMaybe it was just a myth.\n\nMarie spots\
  \ a group cramming into a van taxi. \n\n\u201CMinga?\u201D They nod and and wave\
  \ us in. Our luck continues.\n\nWeathered wooden farms, stilted fisherman shacks,\
  \ and waving grasses in pasture lands add to the island\u2019s magic.\n\n\u201C\
  Where are we going?\u201D I realise I have no idea. \n\n\u201CA place with one house\
  \ every few kilometres,\u201D the driver says. \u201CLike most parts out here.\u201D\
  \n\nChiloe\u2019s distinctive dialect and traditions have been sheltered by the\
  \ water for generations. That\u2019s why many Chilotes oppose a bridge to the mainland.\
  \ \n\n\u201CIt\u2019ll bring money but our way of life will die,\u201D he explains.\
  \ \u201CIt\u2019s not worth the cost.\u201D\n\nBefore long, the van rumbles to a\
  \ stop in a field turned makeshift parking lot. \n\nA hundred people crowd the edges\
  \ of the grassy expanse. Families set out picnics and young couples wait with cell\
  \ phones poised to capture the big event. \n\nMinga is a Chilote term meaning \u201C\
  an exchange of help for benefit.\u201D This equally practical and unusual tradition\
  \ is the definition of moving house.\n\nAn entire home is carried either by land\
  \ or sea with the help of the entire community. It\u2019s delivered to greener pastures\
  \ or better fishing grounds.\n\nWe get absorbed into the crowd with customary hugs\
  \ and cheek kisses. Considering our only invite was a sketchy paper ad, I\u2019\
  ve never felt more welcome.\n\n\u201CThe Minga invited you,\u201D a shopkeeper jokes.\
  \ A few food trucks have rolled in for the day.\n\nShe slides greasy empanadas into\
  \ a paper bag and sells us wine by the bottle.\n\nMingas are also an important gathering\
  \ place for people from the remote countryside. They become day long fiestas of\
  \ music and drinks. \n\nBut, something feels missing. \n\n\u201CWait, where\u2019\
  s the house?\u201D I ask. Everyone shrugs. \n\nMarie and I walk back up towards\
  \ the parking lot to find it -- when it finds us. \n\nI gasp. \n\nI\u2019d expected\
  \ a tiny hut being painstakingly dragged over rolling logs. Instead, a full two\
  \ story home is flying down the hill -- directly at us. \n\nSix pairs of steers\
  \ drag it like a sleigh at a gallop. It barely misses a line of cars and rips out\
  \ a wire fence. \n\n\u201CHuey!\u201D The crowd yells a Chilote spin on \u201CJesus!\u201D\
  \ \n\nCrunch. The sleigh twists sharply and grates to a halt. \n\nShepherds race\
  \ over to switch their teams of boyes, oxen. These gentle, brown spotted titans\
  \ each get an encouraging pat and harness adjustment. \n\nI walk behind the house\
  \ and push. Laughter erupts from the rowdy crowd. Comedy is my contribution, my\
  \ Minga.\n\nIn excited sprints, the home meanders the final 100 metres to what seems\
  \ like a \u201Cgood enough\u201D location. \n\nThe official nod is given. A band\
  \ complete with an accordion and a man clapping together a cow bone breaks out country\
  \ music. \n\nWe\u2019re ushered inside the home and head upstairs to a second floor\
  \ window.\n\nBelow, campesinos, farmers begin Chile\u2019s version of square dancing:\
  \ Cueca. Like everything else, it\u2019s distinctive here. \n\nMen sweep their hats\
  \ at the ground, playfully chasing the skirts of their partner. The women whip their\
  \ handkerchief back to scold them. \n\nClap clap. Clap clap. We join the two clap\
  \ call of the next set.\n\nWe\u2019ve stepped into a real life legend.\n\nAnd, while\
  \ I can't say it\u2019s supernatural, today\u2019s flying house will certainly make\
  \ a good story."
