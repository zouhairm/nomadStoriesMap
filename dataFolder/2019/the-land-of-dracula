Text: "I wake up one day and get surprised by an amazing deal - \"Air France premium\
  \ economy to Bucharest for $340 round trip!\". Romania... Interesting! I don't know\
  \ much about the country, what is there to do? This deal is too good to waste any\
  \ time researching, I get my credit card, my Skymiles number and after a couple\
  \ of clicks, I'm going to Romania!\nA couple of months later, I settle into my very\
  \ comfortable Air France premium economy seat. Not only I get to add several thousands\
  \ of miles to my Delta account, I also get to spend a few hours enjoying French\
  \ hospitality while flying in the world's largest passenger airplane. The A380,\
  \ such an amazing engineering marvel!\nThe first surprise comes as soon as I step\
  \ out of the airplane in Bucharest, reading the signs I realized the language is\
  \ rather familiar! Being from Brazil, my mother tongue is Portuguese and after a\
  \ quick Google search I learn that Romanian is a romance language that somehow made\
  \ its way to Eastern Europe. Who knew!?\nI really enjoy exploring Bucharest, I let\
  \ myself walk along its wide avenues, I walk across a huge urban park and the day\
  \ culminates in front of the second largest administrative building in the world\
  \ \u2013 the Palace of the Parliament. Its 84 meters in height and 365,000 square\
  \ meters of floor area is sure to impress even the most seasoned traveler. \nThe\
  \ highlight of the trip comes on the third and final day in Romania. I head back\
  \ to the airport to pick up my car rental, even though Romanian was surprisingly\
  \ similar to Portuguese, it was not similar enough for me to able to communicate\
  \ and unfortunately, the car rental attendant did not speak much English. After\
  \ a long ordeal, one of my most frustrating experiences renting a car, I hop into\
  \ my little Fiat to begin the journey to Transylvania!\nA few months earlier, right\
  \ after I purchased my flights to Bucharest, I remembered that Transylvania was\
  \ located in Romania. From a young age, I was always intrigued by the mysteries\
  \ surrounding that region. In 1897, Bram Stoker wrote the novel \u201CDracula\u201D\
  \ that went on to shape the modern-day tale of vampires. Although a work of fiction,\
  \ Dracula was loosely based on some actual historical facts. Most notably, the main\
  \ character was named after Vlad III Dracula, a ruthless Transylvanian-born ruler\
  \ of Wallachia, who is believed to have killed up to 100,000 people mostly by impaling.\
  \ \nNot even a torrential summer storm that forced me to pull over for more than\
  \ 30 minutes will impede me from reaching my destination. After 3 hours of driving\
  \ through the plains and mountains of the Romanian country side I finally arrive\
  \ at Bran Castle. Commonly known outside Romania as Dracula\u2019s Castle, there\
  \ is no evidence that Bran Stoker knew about it when he wrote the famous novel,\
  \ and the book\u2019s description of the castle does not even match the appearance\
  \ of Bran Castle. I know, some may call it a tourist trap, but I genuinely enjoyed\
  \ the adventure of getting there and it is nonetheless a beautiful structure on\
  \ the border of Transylvania and Wallachia.\nOn the way back to Bucharest I stopped\
  \ at a small village where the locals were enjoying a typical summer festival. I\
  \ was lucky to experience the local food, traditional outfits, music and dancing.\
  \ Little unplanned surprises like this one is what makes me love traveling so much.\n\
  I may not have found Dracula or any other less known vampires, but I found a beautiful\
  \ country with wonderful people and a very cool language."
