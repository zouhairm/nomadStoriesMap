Text: "My travels through Italy have bestowed upon me two things: a fondness for gothic\
  \ and baroque architecture, and a severe caffeine addiction. Today in Bologna, I\
  \ was headed to the Basilica di San Petronio \u2013 but first, espresso. \n\nChurches\
  \ have more in common with coffee shops than I initially thought \u2013 both can\
  \ be characterized by the feeling of a transient suspension of time. In a church,\
  \ the stillness emanates from its hallowed history, the gild and gold, the frescoes\
  \ reinforcing its role as the house of God. In caff\xE8s, the feeling accompanies\
  \ the heady anticipatory aroma of coffee. For an indeterminate period, my world\
  \ is reduced to the space between me and a cup, filled with the invigorating scent\
  \ of freshly roasted beans and my thoughts.\n\nI was here in Bologna because I sought\
  \ the divine in painted arches, in marble churches, in the carved flesh and sinews\
  \ of Renaissance sculptures. \n\nBut when I inhale the steam rising off my bowl\
  \ of freshly prepared tortellini en brodo for breakfast, I become overwhelmed by\
  \ the compulsive desire to take a detour.\n\nI had also felt something of the sacrosanct\
  \ in the craft of an expertly pulled doppio. In letting paper-thin coppa di testa\
  \ dissolve on my tongue. In cutting into a ball of cushiony burrata, breathing in\
  \ its milky scent mingling with herbaceous basil as the curd and cream spill out\
  \ before me like an offering.\n\nAt the end of the Via dell\u2019Indipendenza, I\
  \ turn left instead of right.\n\nThe Mercato delle Erbe is, foremost, a feast for\
  \ rapacious eyes \u2013 seasonal produce, tempting piles of pasta, salamis and prosciutto,\
  \ and various spice blends compete for attention. I let my nose lead the way, toward\
  \ the plump, earthy tomatoes; the floral melons; the delightfully pungent Parmesan;\
  \ shepherded back to the first vendor by the tantalizing aroma of brown butter and\
  \ lemon juice drizzled over tortelli. \n\nAfter a few circuits through the market,\
  \ I acquire a bag of rotund figs \u2013 a large green variety I\u2019ve never seen\
  \ before \u2013 and continue on my way. I reach the Basilica steps before I give\
  \ in to the urge to enjoy them. \n\nI pause in the piazza to take in the contrast\
  \ of young Italians dressed in black, smoking and drinking liquor from the bottle\
  \ on the basilica steps. I stand in the simmering sun, eating overripe figs from\
  \ a paper bag with the immoderate impatience of someone half my age, ignoring how\
  \ my hands are already sticky with viscous nectar. I plunge my fingers back into\
  \ the bag for more, gorging on the figs and the sensation of slightly bruised fruit\
  \ bursting open in my mouth.\n\nAt that moment, I am overcome with a desire to recreate\
  \ the scene in prose one day. A facsimile stitched together with metaphors, this\
  \ impression of hooligans and churchgoers, and beside them, a single black-haired\
  \ foreign girl embarking on a gastronomic pilgrimage. \n\nThe fruits in supermarkets\
  \ back home in the US are too perfect; smooth orbs with colors enhanced by science.\
  \ They no longer taste like anything . No more grapes that taste of roses, or grapes\
  \ that taste of grapes. The actual imitates the imitation. I remember tomatoes sitting\
  \ forgotten on my counter for too long, like figurines in an ill-conceived centerpiece,\
  \ undecaying. We seem to have forgotten that fruit always tastes sweeter on the\
  \ precipice of rot.\n\nI split fig after fig open to suck the flesh out, uncaring\
  \ that I\u2019m smearing juice over my chin, marveling at how the humble fruit has\
  \ filled me with a voracious hunger to consume and be consumed by sensorial beauty.\
  \ Is it gluttony, this unquenchable appetite to experience and to relish?\n\nI once\
  \ read that female wasps pollinate figs by burrowing into them, only to become trapped\
  \ inside, absorbed by the bud as it ripens. Licking nectar from my lips, I silently\
  \ give thanks through the act of savoring. What is sacred if not this sweet sacrifice,\
  \ this gradual transformation into honeyed fruit?"
