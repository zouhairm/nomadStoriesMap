Text: "My mother is half Japanese and my father is Chinese, born and raised in Sydney,\
  \ Australia - however, I grew up in London. A pretty bizarre background and an electic\
  \ childhood to say the least. In 2016 I visited Japan for the first time in my life\
  \ and was completely bowled over by the entire experience. \nI felt up unto this\
  \ point in life that I was fairly well travelled background. However, I had absolutely\
  \ no clue as to what Japan would offer. Of course you know the iconic neon lights\
  \ and pedestrian crossings of Shinjuku, Tokyo and you'd recognise the stunning architecture\
  \ of the Buddhist temples. But  beyond those stereotypical images I had no clue\
  \ what to anticipate from Japan - the people, the culture and the landscape. This\
  \ country holds half of my heritage and is where my mother grew up, so the gravitas\
  \ this trip held was immense and the unknown held such exciting prospects. \n\n\
  We landed in Tokyo and the culture shock was something I'd never experience before.\
  \ Travelling Japan in comparison to Europe is another ballgame entirely, we found\
  \ hardly anyone spoke English, including tourist information centres at train stations.\
  \ Thank god my mum was on hand as our personal translator. I found the most random\
  \ daily features of the Japanese lifestyle baffled me. Something as simple as going\
  \ to the toilet was already a memorable experience. The toilets are electronic and\
  \ play trickling water sounds to relax you - shock and confusion was overwhelming\
  \ when this strange music started playing, from the toilet seat. In antithesis,\
  \ traditional Japanese toilets are built into the ground so ladies can easily use\
  \ the toilet when in a Kimono (everything had such a deliberate , intelligent design).\
  \ That toilet example strangely encompasses Japanese culture entirely - the stark\
  \ contrast and marriage between the traditional and the intensely technologically\
  \ advanced.\n\nIf you've ever travelled on the Shinkansen (the bullet train) and\
  \ see the train arrive at the end of the line, you will witness the most efficient,\
  \ well-oiled machine of a cleaning process in a public transport system in the world\
  \ (by my regard). In matching baby pink outfits, featuring a baseball cap, apron\
  \ and fully equipped pink duffle bag, the cleaning ladies simultaneously bow as\
  \ each passenger steps off the train from their assigned carriage. The women then\
  \ proceed to attack each carriage swiveling the chairs round, replacing each head\
  \ rest cover, dusting the chairs and spraying and wiping the windows in approximately\
  \ 4 minutes flat. I'll tell you I've lived in London for 15 years and am still yet\
  \ to witness the London Underground being dusted or wiped down. \n\nBeyond the wonderful\
  \ culture shock of Tokyo and its electric, bustling atmosphere, the vast diversity\
  \ across Japan's landscape is breathtaking. From the mountains and greenery of renowned\
  \ locations like the Kiyomizudera Temple set in the beautiful old town of Kyoto.\
  \ To the beaches in Kobe, my mother's hometown, world famous for the best beef in\
  \ the world. We would stroll through the old lanes of Kyoto and see couples walking\
  \ down the streets in kimonos, beside Harajuku teenagers followed by a crippled\
  \ elderly man walking at a 90 degree angle. The diversity in the Japanese people\
  \ was beautiful. Everything offered such rich, vivid culture - the food, the markets,\
  \ the streets, the architecture. The buildings told a story with their grand magnificent\
  \ golden accents or humble wooden pillars draped in traditional cloth paintings.\
  \ \n\nFor me the 'leap into the unknown' wasn't a foreign country so distant and\
  \ obscure from society or the media that I had no idea what to expect. The 'unknown'\
  \ was a genuine understanding of the country and the culture of Japan, beyond preconceived\
  \ perceptions so I could understand my family's history and heritage. The 'unknown'\
  \ was discovering where I'm from and immersing myself in an entirely foreign language,\
  \ culture and country from anything that I've known. I have plans to go back to\
  \ Japan one day and delve further into the intense culture shock, to discover further\
  \ the iconic landscape, the historic traditions and the genuinely kind Japanese\
  \ people."
