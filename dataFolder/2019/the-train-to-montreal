Text: "I\u2019ll be spending the next four days in Montreal. And like the obsessive\
  \ person that I am, I\u2019ve already planned them out. The restaurants I\u2019\
  ll go to. The photos I\u2019ll take. And the fun little activities I\u2019ll do\
  \ in between eating. As I stand at Penn station drinking my coffee that I pick up\
  \ every morning, at the same vendor, made the same way I like it, I think about\
  \ this, and about how obsessive I am. I also think about how interesting it is that\
  \ someone could get to so many places from just one station. Being from Texas, the\
  \ biggest state in the US, I love that in just a few hours I could be somewhere\
  \ new, and in ten more hours, a different country.\n\nIt would have been less if\
  \ I had driven, but I decided to take the ten-hour train ride from New York to Montreal\
  \ rather than driving six hours for a few reasons. One of them being that I wanted\
  \ to use the time to read a few of the books I\u2019ve started. I\u2019m one of\
  \ those people that can\u2019t help but start four books at a time and being in\
  \ a place like New York City, which is so fast paced and chaotic at times, it\u2019\
  s hard to find an hour to sit down and read without having twenty other things running\
  \ through my mind.\n\nPlus I also love trains. I love their rhythm. The sounds they\
  \ make as they move along the tracks. I don\u2019t have to keep my eyes on the road\
  \ the way I do when I\u2019m driving. I can just lay back in my coach seat, read\
  \ my book, drink my coffee; and occasionally look out of the window and enjoy the\
  \ beautiful scenery. So here I was about to just do that. \n\nI wouldn\u2019t be\
  \ arriving until nearly 8pm. Just in time for a late supper at that pizza place\
  \ I\u2019d been eyeing the last time I was in Montreal. I say that as though I go\
  \ there all the time. Really it\u2019s only been twice. Both times during the cold\
  \ season. But I feel like that is the way to see old Montreal.\n\nSeveral hours\
  \ into my train ride I\u2019m finishing off my now cold coffee that I\u2019ve been\
  \ sipping the entire time, and one of the four books. I\u2019m now starting to get\
  \ anxious. Since moving to New York, I\u2019ve become one of those people that always\
  \ have to be doing multiple things at once. I\u2019m always moving. Always thinking.\
  \ Or overthinking. And when I\u2019m not doing that, I\u2019m at the gym. So I only\
  \ had two options now. Sleep. Or eat. I decided sleep was the best alternative to\
  \ eating train food, so I laid my head back and let the sounds of the train put\
  \ me to sleep. \n\nWhen I wake up we are a little over an hour from Montreal and\
  \ I\u2019ve realized I didn\u2019t check to see if my fianc\xE9 had texted me. He\
  \ is flying in to meet me there. First we\u2019ll meet at the hotel, Auberge du\
  \ Vieux-Port that overlooks the Saint Lawrence River.  Then we\u2019ll walk down\
  \ the cobbled streets of old Montreal to Bevo Bar & Pizzeria, where I plan on stuffing\
  \ myself with pizza and my favorite Canadian dish, poutine. My stomach is rumbling\
  \ as I think about it. Fries. Cheese. My two favorite things. Smothered in gravy.\
  \ By the time I\u2019m done fantasizing about all my poutine we\u2019ve arrived.\
  \ My fianc\xE9 has texted me back. I wait patiently for everyone else to get off\
  \ the train before I gather my bags and head towards the front of the train. I like\
  \ to take my time getting off trains. Looking around the inside of the train, it\
  \ makes me sad for some reason, the same feeling I get when I leave a hotel room\
  \ at checkout. So I say goodbye one last time to the train, step out of the passenger\
  \ car. And begin my four-day journey in Montreal."
