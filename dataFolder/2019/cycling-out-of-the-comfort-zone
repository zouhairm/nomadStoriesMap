Text: "Last summer, I had an extraordinary opportunity to explore one of the African\
  \ countries with my couple. As I have never been to African lands, we chose Senegal,\
  \ a safe, stable and welcoming country, also well known for the \"teranga\", which\
  \ in Wolof language means \u201Chospitality\u201D.\n\nSoon we were landing at Dakar\
  \ without a return ticket. The capital is a great place to start the trip, absorb\
  \ the atmosphere and familiarize yourself with the country you are in. Within a\
  \ short distance we found the bustling markets of downtown together with the beaches\
  \ surrounding the quite and picturesque \xCEle de Gor\xE9e \u2013 which records\
  \ the painful history of the slave trade. A visit to Dakar is a surprising experience\
  \ of contrasts between modernity and tradition. \n\nWith a population close to 2.5\
  \ million in its metropolitan area, Dakar showed us the ethnic wealth of the country.\
  \ It is important to know that Wolof is the majority ethnic group and their language\
  \ is the most widespread. Other groups are the Serer (second in number), Lebu or\
  \ Mandinga. More singular, the Peul, that has been crossing the steppes and savannahs\
  \ of Africa for centuries, and the Diola that with 7% occupy above all Casamance\
  \ with a strong cultural and political identity. \n\nUnderstanding the multiplicity\
  \ of ethnic groups meant for us to submerge on the country. But we were ready to\
  \ do it. Our plan was to make a truly stunning bike tour along senegalese south\
  \ coastline. You could wonder why coming up with a ride trip? We just looked forward\
  \ to cut the average monthly cost and give us the opportunity to discover longer\
  \ distances without missing local details.\n\nOnce negotiating with different local\
  \ merchants, we found two suitable bicycles for us. What started as an idea became\
  \ a 200kms route from Dakar to the Sine Saloum delta. \n\nRiding is definitely not\
  \ as easy as it looks. After some riding experience with unsealed roads, we begin\
  \ to realize that riding could be complicated, if not dangerous. But the risky ride\
  \ allowed us to appreciate the whole landscape evolution. While the dry landscape\
  \ of the Sahel gradually left place to the humid and tropical areas of Casamance,\
  \ we were mostly amazed by the savannah landscape with its huge baobabs and diversity\
  \ of communities.\n\nWe passed through touristic towns such as Saly Portudal, where\
  \ luxurious hotels are grouped into a resort and we stopped at such traditional\
  \ villages as Siendou or Somone. There, families welcomed us as another member of\
  \ their community, sharing experiences, beliefs and dreams, also food to proper\
  \ recover at the end of the trail.\n\nSince it was august, markets were filled with\
  \ lambs waiting to become the protagonist of the upcoming the \u201CTabaski\u201D\
  \ Muslim festival, an event great importance that virtually paralyzed the country\
  \ for a few days. Islam plays an important role in Senegalese societies but both\
  \ Muslims and Christians coexist in genuine peace. The shell island of Joal-Fadiouth\
  \ is well known for its mixed-religion cemetery surrounded by gnarled baobabs in\
  \ a bewildering expanse of mangroves. \n\nNear Ndangane, we met Sana who offered\
  \ us a half-day boat tour in the Sine Saloum Delta, entirely protected within the\
  \ UNESCO World Heritage Committee for encompassing over 200 islands, mangrove forests\
  \ and an important bird area. For enjoying the quiet trip by dugout canoe through\
  \ the mangrove channels we sold the bikes to local people \u2013 the classic win-win\
  \ situation. Our friend Sana ended up driving us with his canoe to the southern\
  \ Dionouar and Niodior islands, small oasis of calm.\n\nAt Dionouar Island we were\
  \ lucky enough to meet another local men, Tidiane, who had migrated to Spain in\
  \ 2005 for a new prosperous future. Grateful for the integration Spain had offered\
  \ him he welcomed us one week at his house, enjoying typical Senegalese dishes while\
  \ the sunset conquered us all together on the shores of the sea. The beauty of different\
  \ beaches, the sensuality of its music and the warmth of its people, was pure.\n\
  \nHopefully we will inspire others to go outside of their comfort zone because there\
  \ is nothing more valuable in life than the experiences you get with travel and\
  \ exposure to different cultures."
