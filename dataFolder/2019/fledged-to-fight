Text: "I wish I had not peeped out of the window that day.\n\nDuring the monsoon of\
  \ 2017, I was volunteering at a local school in a remote village of Northern Thailand\
  \ called Ban Bo Kaeo. Far away from the full-moon parties and Thai beaches, there\
  \ I was, trying to acquaint young pupils with a language that was completely alien\
  \ to them. Despite the linguistic barriers, my students and fellow teachers soon\
  \ became a second family. Surrounded by lush green paddy fields and long rows of\
  \ banana plantations, the school had a bucolic charm, and with that, a myriad of\
  \ insects.\n\nIt was a muggy Sunday morning and I wanted to sleep longer. Unfortunately,\
  \ the pesky mosquitoes and the \u201Ccock-a-doodle-doo\u201D of the roosters defeated\
  \ me. I eventually gave up and went upstairs for a shower.\n \nWhen I came out of\
  \ the bathroom, I heard a shrieking crow again. This time the sounds were coming\
  \ from the window.\n\nWhat I saw next left me horrified.\n\nA middle-aged man grabbed\
  \ a half-dead rooster from a jute sack. While the bird was still flapping its wings,\
  \ the man immersed it into a large cooking pot, brimming with hot boiling water.\
  \ Before I could digest what I saw, he took the fowl out and started to pluck its\
  \ feathers ruthlessly with his bare hands. Being a vegetarian, it was hard for me\
  \ not to throw up at the terrible sight. Meanwhile, a pitiless boy was busy collecting\
  \ the injured birds that were scattered around.\n\nSuddenly a voice startled me\
  \ from behind. \u201CGood Morning Lavanya! up so early?\u201D It was Kru Yim, my\
  \ only colleague who could speak fluent English. She was living with me within the\
  \ school premises.\n\n\u201CGood Morning Yim! Did you know there was a chicken farm\
  \ next to our school?\u201D I asked, unable to contain my curiosity and shock. Her\
  \ answer wasn\u2019t something I saw coming.\n\n\u201COh yes. This is a game farm\
  \ to raise and train the cockerels. Our ex-principal started the cockfighting business\
  \ after his retirement. In fact, he has invited the school staff for a special event\
  \ tonight. Perhaps you should come along.\u201D\n\nThat evening, I went with Kru\
  \ Yim to attend the event, not because I was keen on watching the blood sport, but\
  \ because I wanted to learn more about this atrocious game. Interestingly, the sport\
  \ was deeply embedded in the local culture. Legend has it that a Thai prince once\
  \ saved his kingdom from the Burmese by winning a cockfight. The tradition might\
  \ have sounded bizarre to me, but for the Thais, these birds were born to fight.\n\
  \nI had never seen such a large gathering in the village before. Men and women from\
  \ other villages had also come to watch the match, along with their children. I\
  \ seemed to be the only foreigner amidst the crowd, which is presumably why I was\
  \ constantly gaped at.\n\nOnce the bets were placed, it was time for the battle\
  \ to begin. Two brave warriors, Pa-Moi and Samui, were held beak to beak by their\
  \ masters, to whip them into a frenzy, and then left to their bloody fate that awaited\
  \ them in the ring. The match was divided in three rounds, each lasting for about\
  \ twenty minutes until one of them was knackered to death. The trainers missed no\
  \ opportunity to pamper their cockerels in between the bouts. The last round was\
  \ particularly intense. After all, a lot of money was at stake.\n\nAs the feathers\
  \ flew in the air, the crowd cheered Samui to victory. Meanwhile, I wondered if\
  \ Pa-Moi, who lay there defeated and broken, would also perish in the cooking pot,\
  \ like the rooster I saw that morning.\n\nAs Samui\u2019s owner received a cash\
  \ prize of 50,000 baht, I sat still on my bench and asked myself: \u201CDo these\
  \ innocent creatures really deserve such a fate?\u201D\n\nThis further compelled\
  \ me to question my own self-righteousness. On the one hand, I couldn\u2019t condone\
  \ such sadistic entertainment, while on the other, I rarely paid heed to whether\
  \ my morning eggs were sourced ethically or where the \u201CPearl Essence\u201D\
  \ of my nail-polish came from.\n\n\u201CDo you fancy some coconut ice-cream, Lavanya?\u201D\
  \ asked Yim, breaking my reverie."
