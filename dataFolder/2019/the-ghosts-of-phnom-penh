Text: "\u201CI booked a beach bungalow for a month in Thailand hoping I would die\
  \ there, but I didn\u2019t. So I had to come back\u201D. I looked at him with real\
  \ interest for the first time. He was tall, incredibly thin and the way he was dressed\
  \ made me think of a glam rock concert. We were sitting at the only two tables outside\
  \ a small coffee shop on Bassac Lane, in Phnom Penh. We both ordered breakfast and\
  \ I had just told him I live in Thailand. In return, he said he has terminal cancer.\
  \ \u201CI will just die here, in Cambodia, instead. My friends promised me a Viking\
  \ funeral in Sihanoukvile\u201D. \n\nHe pushed the barely touched breakfast away\
  \ with his emaciated fingers and lit a cigarette. \u201CI am not sorry, you know.\
  \ I\u2019ve lived well and even if there\u2019s not much life left in me now, I\
  \ still do stuff I like. Last night I jammed at that bar there, across the street.\u201D\
  \ I glanced at the colorful fa\xE7ade of the building he pointed to and said nothing.\
  \ What can one say to a man that casually shares the most intimate thing about life\
  \ \u2013 his death \u2013 with a perfect stranger? \n\nMaybe there\u2019s something\
  \ about this place full of hardship and misfortune that made him consider his incurable\
  \ illness a less distressing way to go compared to the tragedy of his Cambodian\
  \ friends. Everyone he knows lost someone in the Cambodian genocide: a brother,\
  \ an uncle, a parent. And they went in barbaric ways, tortured, maimed, experimented\
  \ upon, discarded in mass graves. \u201CWe think dying is just dying, but not all\
  \ deaths are equal, you know. Have you been to S-21 and the Killing Fields yet?\u201D\
  \ Yes, I had, the day before. The Killing Fields is a haunting place, there are\
  \ still signs warning visitors not to step on bones that may accidentally resurface.\
  \ But I also come from a former communist country and we had our own version of\
  \ S-21. Just that it was so long ago, it doesn\u2019t hurt as much. \n\n\u201CHere\
  \ is different. Everything happened so recent, it\u2019s like ghosts walk the streets\
  \ with you. And the Khmer Rouge murdered nearly a quarter of the population of their\
  \ own country. That\u2019s a lot of ghosts.\u201D He stopped abruptly and raised\
  \ his right hand, spreading cigarette ash all over. He was waving at what could\
  \ have been a ghost. One that seemed somewhat familiar.\n\nI had seen that stooping\
  \ old man before. He was making a living out of selling trinkets to tourists in\
  \ restaurants and bars. Always respectful, never bothersome, wearing his hand-me-down\
  \ jacket and Fedora hat even in the clammy purgatory Phnom Penh becomes during the\
  \ monsoon. He was probably a full grown adult during Pol Pot\u2019s regime, he must\
  \ have witnessed and lived things worthy of novels. Now he was quickly walking towards\
  \ us and greeted my companion cordially. \n \n\u201CAre you hungry? Here, I can\u2019\
  t finish my breakfast, you can have it\u201D. \n \nThe old man sat down eagerly\
  \ and, without a word, started eating. There was something about his hunger, about\
  \ the way he was devouring the already cold eggs, about the way that meal seemed\
  \ to be the single most important thing for him at that precise moment. And then\
  \ it hit me: his hunger was so alive. And it made him appear so alive. \n\nThere\
  \ we were: a man that had everything he wanted, but was so ravaged by disease he\
  \ couldn\u2019t enjoy a simple breakfast; another man that rode out tough times\
  \ and had nothing except for being alive; and myself, a traveler. I then realized\
  \ that out of the two men sitting in front of me, it wasn\u2019t the old man that\
  \ was a ghost. He had too much life left in him."
