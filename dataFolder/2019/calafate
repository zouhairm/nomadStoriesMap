Text: "- Hey\u2026 Have you ever seen lava before?\n- I\u2019m pretty sure I haven\u2019\
  t - I respond.\n- Well\u2026 have a look\u2026 - says Alex as he shoves my head\
  \ against the airplane window.\n- Flying this close to an active volcano sounds\
  \ stupid dangerous.\nHe cackles and I can\u2019t help but follow. At the end of\
  \ the day, I ain\u2019t there to have a cozy-safe-trip and I know I won\u2019t get\
  \ one, especially with such companion.\n\nAlex is a proficient and\u2026 non-protocolar\
  \ type of pilot of a small plane who just happens to have some free time for an\
  \ old friend.\n- It all goes South from here - he says as we fly above the narrowest\
  \ point of the Chilean Patagonia.\n- Yeah, just like the twenties.\nHe asks me how\
  \ sure I am about skydiving on my own as I grab the backpack, to which I respond\
  \ affirmatively. No that I am of course. Just like in many other occasions, I think\
  \ to myself that I\u2019ve hit the point of no return, although I haven\u2019t,\
  \ in order to induce myself whatever courage I might have left. For better or for\
  \ worse, it is here, down in the mouth of the wolf, where I feel the most alive,\
  \ where I have my fondest memories stored.\n- Say your fare-...\nAnd so it was,\
  \ as dark as a wolf\u2019s mouth. \u201CWhat if it won\u2019t open? You\u2019ve\
  \ never done this on your own\u201D. I metacognitively thought how fragile my \u201C\
  trick up-my-sleeve\u201D was, as I stared into the abyss, who stared backed into\
  \ me\u2026\n\nTruth is, I have been to the Patagonia before, with this charming\
  \ friend who just tossed me out of this plan, which might just be stupid illegal.\
  \ We were lost and starving in a tourist trail, in a night as dismal as only this\
  \ which I fall into tonight can be. It wasn\u2019t until we encountered three natives\
  \ who helped us that I dismissed the idea to resort to cannibalism. To the best\
  \ of our ignorance, we were unaware that we were surrounded by an edible fruit:\
  \ calafate. One of the locals told me there\u2019s the legend that \u201Che who\
  \ eats calafate, shall return\u201D. Maybe it was given by our precarious situation,\
  \ but I can\u2019t, but remember it as the best I\u2019ve ever had. Unfortunately,\
  \ we never saw these people again, which has filled me with something too similar\
  \ to a sense of loss. Not only for them, but for the place I feared and never visit\
  \ again, or the food I\u2019d never taste.\n\nSo there goes my little trick. I shall\
  \ not die before I return."
