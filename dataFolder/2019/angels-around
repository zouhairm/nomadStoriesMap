Text: "I would like to tell you a true story that took place in June 2015, when I\
  \ saved money with sister and our best friend for several months to make our first\
  \ trip abroad. We took vacations during the same period, packed our bags and left\
  \ to Buenos Aires where we stayed for two days to rest and discover some sights.\
  \ Afterwards, we went to Montevideo (Uruguay) and headed to Punta del Este, a beautiful\
  \ coastal city located two hours from the capital.\n\nThrough the window of the\
  \ bus, it was possible to see the dry winter landscape formed by beautiful open\
  \ fields. As night fell, a fine mist stretched across the road. We arrived at the\
  \ hotel at 8 p.m. and soon noticed the elegant air of the city, but it was empty\
  \ and gloomy. Something seemed wrong. Later we discovered that tourists and millionaires\
  \ went to the place during the summer but in the winter there were only a few residents\
  \ or people with local businesses.\n\nHowever, regardless of the seasons it was\
  \ worthwhile to meet that charming little town. We decided to enjoy each other's\
  \ company and go out for dinner. Fortunately, there was a small restaurant open\
  \ to the side of the hotel, where cooks prepared us huge stuffed crepes while dancing\
  \ to the sounds of Latin music. After dinner, we were informed that the city was\
  \ safe and there was no problem in taking a short stroll down the strip.\nAs we\
  \ walked, the few lights on the street seemed to become less clear, like the candle\
  \ flames that run out slowly. Gradually the fog covered the street in a way that\
  \ back where we came from became unfeasible. The roar of the wind in that empty\
  \ place made the atmosphere more sinister at every step. We were talking quietly\
  \ in a timid attempt to break the awkward silence. The fear mechanized our aimlessly\
  \ walk.\n\nDo you believe in God? Regardless of your answer, I ask your permission\
  \ to tell the version of history that is unanimous for us.\n\nUnexpectedly three\
  \ large street dogs came out of the fog and began to follow us. At first we were\
  \ scared, but soon we saw that they strategically positioned themselves to protect\
  \ us. One of them took the lead and walked like a guide, the second stood next to\
  \ us as a security guard and the third walked behind like a guardian.\n\nA few seconds\
  \ later, we passed by five men who seemed to be the only people there besides us.\
  \ As we passed the group they tried to harass us, but quickly the dogs took the\
  \ lead and cornered them against the wall with loud growls and barks. The animals\
  \ seemed determined to protect us while the men tried to chase them away in vain.\
  \ Meanwhile, the girls and I run for a couple of blocks until we hear nothing else.\
  \ In a few minutes, the dogs came back to us running and alone. They led us to the\
  \ hotel and sat at the door until we entered. As a way of thanking them, we went\
  \ to the room and took the sandwiches we had saved during the trip. However, when\
  \ we returned to the door, there was only a soft mist. The dogs were gone.\n\nWhen\
  \ we told this story to our families, they said they were praying for our safety\
  \ in that moment. After that, our hearts were sure that there was someone watching\
  \ over us. Angels exist and manifest themselves in the most unusual ways to protect\
  \ us. That night more than ever, I prayed, thanked and promised that I would always\
  \ tell this story as proof that there are things greater than our limited understanding.\
  \ Speaking for myself: I didn\u2019t expect to find the faith."
