Text: "I could feel a cool breeze washing over my face as the ferry left the harbour.\
  \ I took my rubber hair in my pocket to tie my hair, to not letting the wind blew\
  \ my hair and blocked my view. Far as my eyes could see, the blue water reflected\
  \ the sky and green hills, a wonderful panorama of Lake Toba. \n\nAfter a few days\
  \ visiting family in my mother\u2019s hometown, we finally had time to enjoy the\
  \ trip. To go to Samosir Island, we \u2013 me, mom, cousin, uncle and aunts, crossed\
  \ Lake Toba on a ferry. \n\nAn hour of sailing had passed by, the land was right\
  \ in front of us. We set ashore and continued our road trip in Samosir Island and\
  \ reached to our first destination, Tugu Simarmata. I saw white monument in the\
  \ shape of a lighthouse from afar. As we got closer I could see two statues before\
  \ the monument that represented as a couple of the reputed founders of the lineage\
  \ of Simarmata clan. \n\nThen, the story flowed from the mouth of these four siblings.\
  \ They told me though their hometown was in Simalungun but their origin land is\
  \ Samosir. Their ancestors migrated from Samosir Island to the eastern bank of Lake\
  \ Toba, from Simalungun to Pematang Siantar and then spread out to the area of Batak\
  \ land. \n\nI walked closer to the statues and saw something below the statues.\
  \ There were not only flowers and bottles of water near the feet of these seated\
  \ statues. I could not believe I found cigarettes, money and fruits were laid out\
  \ before the statues. It is interesting to know the fact that people come from various\
  \ regions to visit this place willingly, just to pay their respects to their ancestors,\
  \ though they do not really know the real figure of their ancestors.\n\nAs we walked\
  \ out and moved to our next destination, my mom came near me and said, \u201CThat\u2019\
  s the history. Never forget history, at least you just need to know about it. Those\
  \ statues are our ancestors, though I was born and raised in Simalungun but our\
  \ origin land is here, Samosir Island.\u201D\n\nIt hit me. They were also my ancestors.\
  \ Their blood is running in my vein though this is not my hometown. I am not a tourist.\
  \ I always feel like a tourist every time I visit my parents\u2019 hometown. I need\
  \ to change my mindset. As my parents are part of the history, so am I. So wherever\
  \ I am, in my father\u2019s hometown; Central Java or in my mother\u2019s hometown;\
  \ North Sumatra, I just need to be a local, mingle with the local people, learn\
  \ their custom and do what the local people do; just like what my parents do. Do\
  \ not make a boundary and see my self as a tourist.\n\nI did not expect to find\
  \ an interesting fact and to get a lesson from this short trip. It was spontaneous\
  \ decision making to join this trip, yet I enjoyed it and had a moment to be grateful.\
  \ I believe it was not a coincidence."
