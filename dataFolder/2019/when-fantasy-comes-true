Text: "The one thing which always excites me is traveling. Traveling is the best escape\
  \ from monotonous life and the best way to learn new cultures or to celebrate life.\
  \ We are all travelers here, we are all meant to travel and not stick to one place,\
  \ else the world wouldn\u2019t be so big. \nThere is so much to learn, so many stories\
  \ to tell. I personally think that \u201Croots and wings\u201D should come together.\
  \ There should be harmony between where we have come from, and where we are going.\
  \ Just because we don\u2019t stick around much to one place doesn\u2019t mean we\
  \ are not attached to it but that there are many other places which demand our affection.\n\
  Interestingly, a place can give different stories to one person and totally opposite\
  \ to other. It can totally refresh you or put you into your biggest conundrum. \
  \ Though time plays a major role in building up your memories about a place.\nTime\
  \ has its own essence. It can play with our emotions and our needs. It makes something\
  \ worth seeing at a particular time and pathetic at the other. So it is important\
  \ to know what to see but more importantly when to see it. One such experience I\
  \ had come across was when I went to Dalhousie.\nI was there for just one day, in\
  \ that limited time I couldn't explore much. So, I chose the place I found to be\
  \ the best. It was the Dainkund peak.\nI have watched sunsets before, but this time\
  \ it was different. Even though it was getting hard for me to catch my breath, I\
  \ was so much involved in the moment and so were my friends. Our target was to reach\
  \ the top of this peak. There wasn\u2019t anything up on the peak though, just an\
  \ old temple. Perhaps, our eyes were set for a bigger price. We wanted to trek,\
  \ to go up, to live a little longer.\nIt was already semi-dark when we started this\
  \ journey. The air was so soft scattering everywhere with silence all around that\
  \ I could almost hear my own heartbeat with every step I took towards the peak.\
  \ My friends started capturing everything on the way. I couldn\u2019t stop myself\
  \ but notice a bench there all alone on this peak, a white but dirty colored bench.\
  \ Like it was a milestone halfway through the total journey or it could be there\
  \ just to sit and enjoy the scenic beauty.\nI walked towards the bench and sat on\
  \ it. It was facing the sunset at that time. It was more like the sun was going\
  \ to sleep in his mother\u2019s lap covering him with clouds. I think I also saw\
  \ a rainbow, but not the ordinary one. It was more of parallel lines which is absurd\
  \ yet the most beautiful thing to witness.\n\nAfter that I joined my friends and\
  \ by the time we reached at the top it got dark. To get back on our feet and beat\
  \ the cold we had some tea and noodles.\nWe started to film everything on our way\
  \ back to the bottom and that\u2019s when we experienced something magical.\nI,\
  \ along with many, just fantasies about lying on the grass under the sky covered\
  \ with stars so bright that you almost neglect all the darkness which the sky holds.\
  \ The cool wind blows and whispers to you to get up and leave them alone. But you\
  \ stay there holding hands of your loved ones to live a little longer. When silence\
  \ talks with your mind and it gets mystical with passing time.\nSo yes, we stayed\
  \ there for almost half an hour or more. Honestly, I lost track of time. I mean\
  \ how I could focus on anything else but at that particular moment.\nEventually,\
  \ we made it back to our hotel. We didn\u2019t say anything to each other that night\
  \ and slept like it was the first day of our life, like it was the first day we\
  \ felt alive.\n \nShubham Dhiman\n    (SAvvY)"
