Text: "THE NEW JUNGKAT BEACH\nMempawah is one of regency in Indonesia which located\
  \ in West Borrneo Province. Categorized as small regency which not as big as the\
  \ other well known province in Indonesia, but Mempawah has few travel destination\
  \ to put in your list. One of that is Jungkat Beach. The last time I remember, this\
  \ place is not as beautiful, as comfortable or as attractive as the other well know\
  \ beach in West Borneo Province. But when I come back to this place, I could say\
  \ that I actually surprised. There are so many improvement in the place where used\
  \ to be a small lake near the beach where there are so many trees around. \nYou\
  \ will find the difference since the entrance gate, nature vibe. Mostly use wood\
  \ material for the interior which match the environment. To enter this place only\
  \ cost Rp. 15k for adult and Rp. 10k for children. Walking through the entrance,\
  \ exactly on the road to the beach you will find variety kind of fruit hanging above\
  \ you. While some gazebo place on the right side where people can take a rest, eat\
  \ or even fishing. Yes fishing, because there is one fishing area right in the middle\
  \ of this place. After passed the fishing area, right in front of fishing area you\
  \ will find the beach. I said there are so many differences on this place since\
  \ the last time I visit it, and yes it really is. You will find so many chairs and\
  \ tables arrange on the beach under the trees which help to cover us from the sunlight.\
  \ Make you can comfortably sit and relax to see the view of the sea while feel the\
  \ fresh wind. Not only sit and relax but you also be able to enjoy a fresh coconut\
  \ water or the other Indonesian dish which served by the restaurant, erase all worries\
  \ if you might feel hungry or thirsty while being there. If you want to feel the\
  \ other excitement you can try to ride duck crank on the lake right after the restaurant\
  \ which only cost Rp. 15k for 30 minutes. The other side of the lake there is small\
  \ place, a signature point  where people use to take picture there because of the\
  \ heart and flower decoration with white and pink color in it. That place also use\
  \ for a band to perform so people here can enjoy a live music.\nPeople who come\
  \ here to spend their weekend will really enjoy this place because of all the facilities.\
  \ From gazebo, fishing area, chair and table, restaurant and the dish, the ride\
  \ and live music plus the view which will make you comfortable to spend hours here.\
  \ I personally had visit this place twice since it renewed, since afternoon until\
  \ sunset and I never feel bored. So, if you like nature and want to spend your holiday\
  \ by relaxing your body, mind and just spend your free time this place should be\
  \ include in your list."
