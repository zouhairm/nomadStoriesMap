Text: "\"I'm out here a thousand miles from my home\nWalkin' a road other men have\
  \ gone down\"\n-\tBob Dylan\n\nBeing an artist myself, nature has poured itself\
  \ onto my canvas.\nRecently, I went backpacking to the picturesque Auroville in\
  \ Pondicherry with its charming French architecture. This is the finest example\
  \ of community living promoting a united world. It is a vision of the future of\
  \ architecture, with a wide range of natural forms, a creation of a human society\
  \ with no predefined boundaries.\n\nWhile entering the galaxy concept plan as created\
  \ by Ar. Roger Anger, I could see the different cultures bringing their value to\
  \ the place. The entrance has a unique theme of open vernacular space, which will\
  \ make one fall in love with the exposed materials and environment they create.\
  \ The Unity pavilion stands to make people aware about human unity and world peace.\
  \ The Russian pavilion which houses around 65 citizens also expresses the art and\
  \ culture of its place. The Tibetan pavilion had its foundation laid by the Dalai\
  \ Lama and has its own unique heritage. When I set foot into these artistic structures,\
  \ it emitted a kind of energy which cultivated peace in my mind. \n\nAfter exploring\
  \ all the other pavilions and their architecture, it made me realize how people\
  \ from different parts of the world can be brought together and how they can share\
  \ their knowledge and lifestyle. \n\nThe place where I stayed was a hostel built\
  \ between trees, surrounded by organic farms and sculptures. Mostly people I met\
  \ there were either on a trail of finding themselves or were trying to pursue their\
  \ dreams. Some of them were runaways trying to escape the suppressive attitude of\
  \ society. \n\nThe best thing I discovered about Auroville was that the whole city\
  \ runs on solar panels and there is no electricity after sunset. Eventually people\
  \ sleep early and wake up at dawn for meditation and yoga. To sustain the green\
  \ environment, people ride bicycles, Luna or just walk. I hitch-hiked for a while\
  \ and later during my stay there, I rented a bike. As the community is spread over\
  \ 2-3 kilometers, basic amenities are available nearby. I walked down every unknown\
  \ path I saw, expecting something different to come up and the surprising part was,\
  \ that I got exactly what I wanted. I explored various types of structures and houses\
  \ of people who were from different parts of the world. They had their unique styles\
  \ and it was something that dragged me into learning something new. \n\nWhen I met\
  \ other backpackers like me, I realized that it is not just adventure that draws\
  \ us to travelling, it is the urge to learn something new and utilize it for the\
  \ good of others. \n\n\u201CTraveling \u2013 it leaves you speechless, then turns\
  \ you into a storyteller.\u201D \u2013 Ibn Battuta"
