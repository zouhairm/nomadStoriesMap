Text: "No one really knows where life may take us. The few people that did know where\
  \ they wanted to were beyond blessed. My story might have begun since eight years\
  \ ago when I first got out of university with a degree. Just like so many other\
  \ teens out there who had no clue what to do with life, I started my white-collar\
  \ job the moment I graduated. Six years into internal disputes, conflicts of interests,\
  \ and personal agenda, I decided I've had enough.\n\nMarching into the airline ticketing\
  \ office on that gloomy afternoon, I booked a flight to Seoul, South Korea, while\
  \ my head imagined and constructed a plausible plan of what I was going to do there.\
  \ Naturally, my parents - like all Asian parents - criticized me for my \"poor\"\
  \ choice. Why hadn't I chosen to go to China or Japan? The Chinese were advancing\
  \ at an exponential rate and Japan was a more dignified country than South Korea.\
  \ I still deny that it was because of the K-Dramas or K-Pop or K-Fever that was\
  \ taking the world by storm. It was, truthfully, based on the single reason that\
  \ I was simply being impulsively rebellious. I wanted to do everything that they\
  \ were against.\n\nWhen I finally walked out of Incheon International Airport in\
  \ February 2017, the biting winter chill did nothing to reduce the thrill of being\
  \ in a completely foreign land. I had gotten a ninety days visa, and I intend to\
  \ make the most out of my stay. My first week in South Korea took me to Busan where\
  \ I shivered in the cold Haeundae sea breeze and shook in the icy wind while snacking\
  \ on the roadside Ahjumma's tteokpokki. In that first week of blissful escape, I\
  \ realized that relying on body language alone for the next eighty something days\
  \ was probably quite dumb.\n\nDeciding that even if I was on the run, I was going\
  \ to take home with me at least something useful. When I got back to Seoul, I enrolled\
  \ in a beginner\u2019s course for Korean language, and my classmates were a pair\
  \ of Chinese twin guys who claimed to be celebrities, an Albanian white-collar worker,\
  \ an Italian Ahjussi (uncle) who was always flirting with our teacher and a cute\
  \ French guy who just wanted to get a Korean girlfriend. Needless to say, the complexity\
  \ of the Korean alphabets that bore too much of a resemblance to Tetris pieces,\
  \ was a challenge to most of us.\n\nDespite the differences in nationalities and\
  \ the language barriers, our then nonexistent Korean knowledge resulted only in\
  \ a lot of awkward hellos in our first week as classmates. But as anyone should\
  \ know, that first \u201Chello\u201D was all it took. The nervous pleasantries eventually\
  \ evolved into animated conversations inside and outside of the classroom walls\
  \ as faces became familiar and friendship blossomed over lunchtimes spent over grilling\
  \ pork belly slices at an all-you-can-eat joint. Foreign to the land, we explored\
  \ the city together, watched cultural events, and became supports for our French\
  \ comrade in his search for love in the clubs on weekends.\n\nNinety days might\
  \ have seemed like a long time when I first set out, but just like that \"time-bending\
  \ quantum-realm\" thing that's supposed to show in the next Avengers movie, the\
  \ days flew by quicker than I thought it would. As if in a breeze, we were finishing\
  \ up our semesters and it was \"time's up\". Goodbyes had never been my strong point,\
  \ so when our farewell night was mainly highlighted with the exchange of hugs, my\
  \ own tears flowed freely without restraint. The bond that had formed between us\
  \ meant a great deal. Considering my past, possibly a whole lot more to me.\n\n\
  Some may call is along the cheesy lines of fate or destiny, but I think I'm probably\
  \ just very lucky. My little trip in Korea did begin as a reckless leap into the\
  \ unknown, but I unexpectedly did end up finding a new sense of appreciation for\
  \ adventure, and along the way, the discovery of some very precious people that\
  \ I would treasure for the rest of my life. Oh, and maybe a third language to add\
  \ to my r\xE9sum\xE9."
