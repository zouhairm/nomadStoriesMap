Text: "I was 25 when i decided to travel alone to Europe. I had nightmares, thought\
  \ i would get lost in every place. In fact, happend, but was better than in my thoughts.\
  \ I went to Spain, Portugal and France. My first language is Spanish, so travelling\
  \ around Spain was easy. I also speak Portugues, because my parents (with no reason)\
  \ send me to learn it when i was child. So...Portugal, was easy too. The climax\
  \ of my travel was when i arrived FRANCE. The language, the streets, french citizens,\
  \ the winter. The winter was coming. In 2012 my telephone didn \xB4t have internet\
  \ and i hadn\xB4t have whatsapp. I arrived at Orly\xB4s airport and my life stopped.\
  \ No one understood my language mix of Spanish, portu english. So, first fatality:\
  \ i couldn\xB4t explain my situation. Second thing: i had forgotten Judith\xB4s\
  \ adress (and that was an emergency, because i hadn\xB4t enough money, and we had\
  \ planned that i would live in her house, during my stay). I was hungry, and i was\
  \ angry, too. I spent 20 euros to call my mother and ask her to enter in my facebook\
  \ account to tell me Judi\xB4s adress. I could have cried but i decided  to go to\
  \  Mc Donald\xB4s to have lunch (Have lunch and keep calm). After that i lost more\
  \ euros in the subway machine, because my lugage didin\xB4t passed correctly. Ok,\
  \ then i had  this lighting thought: It would be a difficult stay, but i\xB4ll make\
  \ it a WONDERFUL difficult stay. I was in Paris. PARIS, baby. So, the next time\
  \ i lost my subway pass i asked some \nyonkis to open the passing door for me. I\
  \ was grateful, because that open door meant for me a second  Paris begining."
