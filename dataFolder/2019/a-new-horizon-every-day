Text: "Since August 2018 I've been traveling around Australia with the thrive for\
  \ adventure. I met so many cool and interesting people on my journey though some\
  \ encounters were quite strange. Because I am traveling alone I have no limits and\
  \ can make the decisions about my next destination spontaneously and independent\
  \ of others. I would be lying though if I said it wasn't hard sometimes to leave\
  \ people behind or that I was never lonely. But I figure that's part of the experience\
  \ and who knows? I might see them all again some day.\nI started off in Melbourne\
  \ and I remember being pretty intimidated by the new country, the city life and\
  \ how different living in a hostel is from what I knew from home. I met new people\
  \ every day and once the cultural shock had passed I really had a great time. The\
  \ best part there was  the Great Ocean Road. It is probably the most popular trip\
  \ one simply must do as a backpacker in Victoria. Though I learned quickly that\
  \ even though Australia is the country of sunshine and heat the winter  still gets\
  \ pretty cold, especially if you're sleeping in a rented car at a campsite near\
  \ the highway. \nMy next destination was Sydney, a city I fell in love with quickly\
  \ despite how busy and money oriented it is. At first I was surprised how easy it\
  \ was to find a job, though I found out the hard way that not every job is a good\
  \ job, no matter how nice your collegues are: it was a door to door business that\
  \ hired backpackers exclusively as they need money and don't care how bad the work\
  \ is they have to do to earn it. After three month of working there for only little\
  \ profit I left the company and explored the beaches in the Sydney area where I\
  \ found that if you are stupid enough to swim out too far and get caught up in a\
  \ current, you have to deal with the humiliation of being 'rescued' by a liffeguard\
  \ on a surfboard. \nWith two friend I had met during my sales job in Sydney I headed\
  \ to Queensland next, determined to earn lots of money with farm work. Brisbane\
  \ is a pretty city, too though it reminded me of a cheaper version of Sydney. Four\
  \ hours further north is a town called Bundaberg which is famous for its bad working\
  \ hostels, something I, of course, had to learn the hard way. Of the four weeks\
  \ I stayed there I only worked one, as the manager kept telling me I would be working\
  \ soon. Once I realized that he was only trying to keep me there for the rent I\
  \ went back to Brisbane and decided that I would use the last few month of my Visa\
  \ to travel the west coast if Australia. Perth is beautiful and full of art and\
  \ skyscrapers- somehow a mixture if both Melbourne and Sydney. Kangaroos are everywhere\
  \ and dolphins are even in the rivers. The best experience I made here so far was\
  \ when I visited Mandurah Beach, a place where you can feed and touch dolphins.\
  \ But there is still many places I want to see: The Pink Lake- a lake that is, in\
  \ fact, pink, the red cliffs of Cable Beach and The Ningaloo Reef Marine Park where\
  \ I plan to do take diving lessons.\nTraveling is amazing and it's a great experience\
  \ to be spontaneous and go to knew places whenever you feel like it. I just can't\
  \ get enough and will definitely keep on traveling after Australia. Though I haven't\
  \ decided whether to do Asia, Canada or Scandinavia first. \nA new horizon every\
  \ day."
