Text: "Sikkim is a small state in India. Located in the lap of Himalaya mountains.\
  \ In my final year of degree I was doing my internship and there was a 7 day break\
  \ for festival . Me and my friends planned to go on a trip to Sikkim . Nobody has\
  \ the idea how to get there. Any trip will become memorable if you explore the way\
  \ that leads to that place. So, the bus journey was too enthralling. The road is\
  \ carved out of mountain leading to extreme curves which runs parallel to Teesta\
  \ river. Finally after 3 hours of drive we reached our destination. As we don't\
  \ have much luggage we hire a taxi and start sight seeing. There were a lot of monasteries.\
  \ Each one is better than the previous one. They are so peaceful and relaxing that\
  \ it seems we are on a sudden planer . No honking no city noises far away from the\
  \ day to day rush of life. The monks were look peaceful as if they have nothing\
  \ to worry about in life. From there we went to Tsomgo lake which is situated at\
  \ a enormous height of 10000 feet . The water was icy cold yet vey calm. The lake\
  \ was surrounded by the beautiful mountains peacefully holding the water . There\
  \ are some small waterfall which are vey exotic. At this time the sun is almost\
  \ going down. So we are going back to the capital, Gangtok. After do finding a cheap\
  \ hostel. We set out on to explore the city on foot. At first we are roaming here\
  \ and there. Going through all the hand crafted stoles jacket and hats . It a paradise\
  \ for shopping . From there we went to MG Road . It a no vehicle area , so the streets\
  \ were full of people. Everyone was busing eating hanging out and chilling. We went\
  \ further inside the market. Each ally leads to a whole new area of shops and eateries.\
  \ We stopped at a place and ordered some local snack. The taste was amazing. No\
  \ so spicy but you can feel the taste of everything. Next day we went to Nathu La,\
  \ a mountain pass between India and China. This pass has been in use for 2000 years\
  \ . Chinese travelers used to come to India by this pass. It was at a height of\
  \ 14000 feet. The oxygen was thin but the scenery was amazing. There were military\
  \ outpost everywhere but no disturbance to the visiting people. \nThis whole trip\
  \ a life time time experience .  I want close myself by a famous Japanese proverb\
  \ \"SEND THE BELOVED CHILD ON A JOURNEY\"."
