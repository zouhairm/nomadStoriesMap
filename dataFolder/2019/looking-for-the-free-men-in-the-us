Text: "In front of me, inside this room with no ceiling they call the \u201CMusic\
  \ Room,\u201D the 20x30 inch photography framed in carved wood radiates the glow\
  \ of a religious figurine. From the faded image, a bare-chested fellow with a rounded\
  \ belly smiles at me, sitting on the edge of the opened door of a Volkswagen van.\
  \ Placed on the surface of a grand piano, the photo is covered by dust. That same\
  \ dust that here, in the Sonora Desert, California, devours it all.  \n \u201CWho\u2019\
  s the dude in the photo?\u201D I ask the \u201CWizard.\u201D \nThe old man takes\
  \ a sip of his glass of wine and smiles, revealing a set of black rotten teeth.\
  \ \u201COh, that\u2019s Charlie.\" \nHe means Charlie Russel, the late founder of\
  \ this open-air junk museum. His ashes are kept here, in the Music Room, an appropriate\
  \ place for such a beloved local celebrity. In 2007, he arrived at Slab City, a\
  \ land illegally occupied by ramshackle trailers, and built a scrap metal art garden\
  \ that he named \u201CEast Jesus\u201D \u2013an expression for \u201Cnobody\u2019\
  s land.\u201D \nAll around me, automobile pieces and old household appliances emerge\
  \ from the earth, giving shape to terrifying human figures. Bent nails, broken glass,\
  \ rusty tinplate; it is as if everything in this courtyard was meant to be dangerous.\
  \ But the most reputed of East Jesus\u2019 sculptures is \u201CTV Wall,\u201D a\
  \ 10-feet-tall, 50-feet-long wall made of old TVs by the artist Flip Cassidy. \n\
  This is my lucky day, the Wizard announces. Flip is here today. He has been living\
  \ in an RV here at East Jesus for the last month, and it\u2019s likely that he\u2019\
  ll be willing to discuss his work with me.  \n\u201CNo way! You\u2019re messing\
  \ with me,\u201D I can\u2019t help replying, skeptical about the idea that a famous\
  \ artist would talk to me with no previous notice. \nBut the Wizard frowns back\
  \ at me, the Ying-and-Yang tattoo on his forehead distorting into a blot. \u201C\
  Why would you think that I\u2019m tricking you?\u201D \nFor a second, I fear that\
  \ I have deeply offended my new friend. I make clumsy gestures with my hands and\
  \ lips, trying to explain that sometimes people lie and cheat for no reason.\n\u201C\
  We\u2019re not like that,\u201D he replies, fingering his grey beard. \u201CBut\
  \ I know that human beings can be pricks when they want to. I understand the world\
  \ you come from,\u201D he beams at me.  \nBut this is not true. He has no idea of\
  \ what world I come from. And he doesn\u2019t know either that my world has changed\
  \ more in the last twelve months than during my entire lifetime. \nA year ago, I\
  \ boarded a Chilean airplane to California, carrying only two suitcases and an international\
  \ student visa. During the first months, I navigated my new surroundings as a tourist\
  \ would do it, captivated by the cleanness of the streets and the easy smiling of\
  \ the local people. But facades can only be held for a certain amount of time.\n\
  Eventually, I learned that for the average U.S. citizen we, Latin Americans, are\
  \ all just \u201CLatino\u201D people \u2013the name of our country doesn\u2019t\
  \ matter. I began noticing the ugly looks that the saleswomen gave me at the retail\
  \ stores, and the awkward grimaces when I mentioned where I was from and people\
  \ didn't know where to place it on the map. Then Trump got elected, and his public\
  \ statements became the backdrop to my everyday ritual in front of the mirror asking\
  \ myself \u201Cwhat am I waiting to go back?\u201D \nUntil one day, that I ran online\
  \ into an article about Slab City. It described it as \u201Cthe last free place\
  \ in America,\u201D a laggards' community that had surged in the sixties on the\
  \ remains of an abandoned military base where hippies and castaways had settled\
  \ in. During the following months, my mind traveled to this place over and over,\
  \ seeking relief and the illusion of a world where all men are equal.  \nAnd here\
  \ I am now, covered in desert dust, standing in front of an old man with a mysterious\
  \ name who unwittingly reminds me of my outsider condition. Here I am now, ready\
  \ to follow him to wherever he takes me."
