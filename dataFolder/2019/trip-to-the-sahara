Text: "In the summer i went to the Sahara with my family  and when i first saw it\
  \ i was shocked  and fascinated, I saw the sand look like a gold  carpet of silk\
  \ that covers all my eyesight.\nIn the sunrise, after we had breakfast we went for\
  \ quick walk and I saw the the sand sparkles like pieces of shiny  gold and i was\
  \ amazed  at the plants that grow there despite  the hard and  difficult conditions\
  \  they looked like fearless warrior that never gives up and fight all the conditions\
  \  to survive and live and after a short time a began to feel a tremendous  rise\
  \ in the temperature and storng hot winds started to blow and i started  to feel\
  \ like i was walking  in a boiling oven and so we changed our clothes to more suitable\
  \ clothes  that covered  our head and hands and in the midday we rode the camels\
  \ and the guide  took us to an  oasis and i was very surprised by the steady walk\
  \ of the camels despite the searing sands and the extreme heat and the hot strong\
  \ winds they looked like a ships in the desert. \nAnd when we arrived  i was amazed\
  \  by the many small rivers and ponds and the palm trees there we even found  chickens\
  \ and ducks  it was like Haven inside a hell and after all that we finished  our\
  \ day with watching the wonderful  sunset it was the most beautiful  thing i saw\
  \ in my entire life \nIt was a magical masterpiece that no artist can accomplish.\n\
  In the night  i was fascinated by another masterpiece and it was the sparkles of\
  \ the stars that looked like sparkles of the sapphire and they  looked so clear\
  \ and close that let you think if you jumb hight enough you can grab some. \nIt\
  \ was an adventure that i will never forget  \nall my life"
