Text: "Call me na\xEFve because this story isn\u2019t about the larger picture that\
  \ changed my life, but the smallest detail caused me to explore \u2013unexplore\
  \ and re-explore my perspectives on home, personal space, friendships and acquaintanceship,\
  \ cultures and cuisines, gaging in diverse experiences and pushing boundaries but\
  \ mainly this one small detail exposed me to the feeling of being accepted without\
  \ having to prompt or dictate for it.  \nLast year I was selected from a large pool\
  \ of chairs who had applied to chair a Model UN conference held in New York City\
  \ and what made the conference even better was that not only the conference was\
  \ inside the United Nations building but moreover it was a fully paid trip. MUNs\
  \ do not suffice to merely speak and raise one's voice; what is most important is\
  \ to be heard and to hear what others have to say. Therefore every single delegate\
  \ must be well prepared, not for their own progress and benefit, but for that of\
  \ others as well. If each delegation is able to prepare themselves to become the\
  \ true ambassadors of their allotted countries, and each individual shall be able\
  \ to take a leap forward in becoming a more informed citizen of the global populace.\
  \ So naturally the conference went well and was a great learning experience. Now\
  \ due to the length of my visa post this 04 day conference I decided to extend my\
  \ stay for two weeks and explore NYC and moreover USA and so I booked myself an\
  \ AirBnB.\n\nI was always told that AirBnB is a hospitality website and usually\
  \ it\u2019s a cheap room without the landlord that I can crash bring girls and simply\
  \ relax in every hedonistic way I want. So I booked the cheapest BnB that advertised\
  \ a single room with a bathroom, a fully equipped kitchen, free WIFI, and a common\
  \ space. This was my leap into the \u2018Unknown\u2019 for the first time I was\
  \ going to say in someone else\u2019s home that was mine to exploit. However once\
  \ I got there contrary to my believe I did not find a key under the mat rather I\
  \ was welcomed by Carlo and Danielle.  While I was paying my taxi, Carlo took my\
  \ suitcase inside and upstairs. I came inside the he took me to kitchen and was\
  \ offered coffee. Since it was 2 degrees outside I accepted. Apparently Carlo and\
  \ Danielle lived in the same apartment but in another room. We made small talk and\
  \ I gave him a box of fridge magnets from Pakistan. They reciprocated by taking\
  \ me to a party and not to mention he covered the Uber this time. Afterwards we\
  \ were joined by one their friends and they took me out for dinner. Sushi on menu\
  \ since my halal/kosher status was still intact. They had never met a Pakistani\
  \ before and we delved in long talk that night. The following day, days, week and\
  \ weeks. Carlo and Danielle showed me around NYC. Their insight to places of cultural\
  \ and historical importance to small ethnic diners, to African market, to strip\
  \ clubs(that\u2019s another story), to stand-up comedy where one must only come\
  \ if one was high, to shopping in Burlington coat factory. I was introduced to their\
  \ friends and friends of friends who each took me around, I was treated and respected\
  \ like a guest and while I did pay my fair share of this exposure to people and\
  \ places yet they welcomed me in a manner that made me revise my taught sensibility\
  \ of New Yorkers. He wasn\u2019t over accommodating and he wasn\u2019t always present\
  \ but small gestures as asking his friends to choose a place or a menu that would\
  \ cater my dietary needs. Making sure I stepped out with an umbrella or simply putting\
  \ a blanket when I dozed off on the couch. On the last day this couple in their\
  \ mid-20s showed that more than larger than life debates and discourses on global\
  \ peace and sustainability what mattered was that we all became just good human\
  \ beings. One good human being at a time can change the world."
