Text: "So my title was given to me,  yes,  but I will say its a marvelous title. \
  \ My name is Julia,  yes,  I'll start with that.  I am absolutely oblivious to the\
  \ world outside ofy tinie tiny town.  No I'm kidding,  I realize that there is way\
  \ more wonders of the world. More spectacular things to see.  I actually had a DNA\
  \ kit done recently and Portugal came up in my DNA...  What a funny little coincidence\
  \ that I am writing this.  But eh...  Isn't that the beauty of life,  and a beauty\
  \ I am..  So.  With all of that nonsense being said..  Choose me.  I want to see\
  \ this big beautiful world we live in.  Cultures,  languages,  all of it.  Besides,\
  \  someone like me deserves to leave this small town where no one understands (Bible\
  \ Belt South Carolina USA) ...  Get me out!  \n\nI would go on and on about how\
  \ I am the best.  But the truth is,  I may not be.   But I will say this.  Adventure\
  \ is something I crave but I am too afraid to just go for it ( trust me if you have\
  \ read this far then you should call me)  but I love it!  I am a cheerful scared\
  \ cat ( Alanis Morrisette Ironic)   to be honest.. But you would love me.  Who knows\
  \ if I'm even writing the write material??  Oh well Portugal is in my blood,  I\
  \ would to expireincet it.  \n\nYours truly (without begging)  \n\nJules\U0001F600"
