Text: "\"Copybooks with stories!\" - I was screaming in the almost deaf ear of my\
  \ former stepfather Kolya. We both hadn't learned the gestural language. Also Kolya\
  \ never wanted to spend money on the hearing aid. \"Simple copybooks, handwritten\
  \ text\" - my voice become hoarse. My boyfriend advised me to write the question\
  \ on a paper.\n \nI didn't visit my native village for ten years after my mother\
  \ and I moved to the capital. My grandmother died at that village. She was a teacher\
  \ of mathematics and she always wanted to be useful. Even when she couldn't walk\
  \ because of injury, she had written a stories to entertain a schoolgirl-me. I don't\
  \ remember what they were, just that it was a children's adventure stories and their\
  \ names: \"Lion Chico and monkey Capa\" and \"Helen and the deer\". In that time\
  \ I fell in love with writing and started to write myself.\n \nWhen moving we took\
  \ very few things, and didn`t take grandmother`s copybooks. I wanted to remember\
  \ who I am and visit my native places. Also to take grandma's stories to translate\
  \ them into electronic format, perhaps to publish them.\n \nGround road on the way\
  \ to the village had the forest on the one side, and sunflower field on another.\
  \ The new owner allowed me to enter the courtyard of the house, which we sold him\
  \ before. He cut down some trees and moved the warehouse for tools. He built a new\
  \ fence and hung a number of the house - fourteen. Mom and I never have it.\n \n\
  My boyfriend and I lay in the grass near the pond to rest. It was so nice and calm\
  \ to lie down, despite ants crawled and mosquitoes bit. Little schoolboy passed\
  \ us. He told that the bus still drive children to school and take them back. There\
  \ are eleven pupils in the village. When I was studying, it were six pupils, and\
  \ seven kilometers of road to school. My mother asked for school bus in the district\
  \ council during one year, despite all their refusals because of small number of\
  \ pupils. I am pleased that, after so many years after our move, other children\
  \ can use my mom achievements.\n \nThe old way to the cemetery, where the grandparents\
  \ were buried, rose up with weeds, so we went through human gardens. Nobody has\
  \ cleaned the graves for a long time. We cleaned up the dried grass, than pulled\
  \ out the fresh grass by hands. When we left the cemetery, a man called me by name.\
  \ It was the driver of the Red ZAZ- the old Soviet car - who often took me from\
  \ school when the bus forgot to come. I couldn`t remember his name.\n \nThe courtyard\
  \ and house of my former stepfather's looked not well-groomed. It seemed that he\
  \ had not changed the sheets for a year. Kolya brewed coffee - 2 tablespoons of\
  \ sugar and 1 tablespoon of coffee in a dirty cup. It was too sweet, but before\
  \ i liked this taste. I didn't find grandmother's copybooks, also as the things\
  \ we left during the move. Kolya said that he had sold mom`s bicycle and chairs\
  \ to buy food and vodka.\n \n\"Oh, all of your copybooks and newspapers I spent\
  \ on the heat of the furnace\" - remembered Kolya. In many Ukrainian villages there\
  \ is no gas heating, and our village is not exception. I ran to the furnace - there\
  \ were pieces of newspapers on the ground and torn pages from my personal diary\
  \ that I was writing in age twelve . There was no one fragment with a grandmother's\
  \ handwriting.\n \nKolya told he was very sad for my mother`s gone and therefore\
  \ he began to drink.\n \nWe walked on an asphalt road where I walked to school when\
  \ the bus didn't arrive. The distance was much shorter than I remember it. I thought\
  \ that I need to write my own stories about the characters my grandm\u0430 invented.\
  \ By the way, her name was Eugenia."
