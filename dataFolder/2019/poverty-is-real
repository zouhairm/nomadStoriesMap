Text: "South Africa, a land sprawling with safaris,  resorts giving one the unforgettable\
  \ experience with nature.  Prosperity is prominent it is well established as compared\
  \ to other African nations thus it is widely recognised. A land that fought for\
  \ freedom, saw the arising of great men and women.  But is it really free? \nAs\
  \ we were driving along the roads of Johannesburg South Africa either side of the\
  \ car window stood well established roads and buildings we were on our way to some\
  \ prestigious shopping mall, something you'd barely find in my country Malawi. We\
  \ came to a halt due to traffic, there was a que and we had to wait.  As I sat comfortably\
  \ in the car.  I saw people of different races, they came to the car window to beg.\
  \ And what struck me most was the fact that I had expected such manner of behavior\
  \ to be in my country but what I did not realise was other countries may suffer\
  \ the same fate. Regardless of how well dressed the beggars are.. \nThe point of\
  \ the matter is beggars come to the car window to beg.  Therefore I came to a realisation\
  \ that regardless of how the world is moving towards innovation and the prosperity\
  \ gap is lessening poverty will not cease to exist at least for now  even in the\
  \ countries we admire."
