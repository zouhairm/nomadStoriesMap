Text: "The smell is the worst part. Always. The pungent rotting garbage mixed with\
  \ open sewage lines. This is the depressing sight you encounter when leaving the\
  \ city of Dhaka in Bangladesh. Although I've been here many times now and know exactly\
  \ what to expect and know that my senses will face this shock - I'm still shocked\
  \ by the shock of it all. The train ride out of the labyrinth that is the ever-expanding,\
  \ now a very quickly industrialized city, is not the most scenic, to the say the\
  \ least. You think to yourself though, \"it makes sense,\" of course all of the\
  \ waste would be dumped in the outskirts of the metropolis.\n\nYou may be surprised,\
  \ but this is not actually a story about waste and garbage and climate change and\
  \ the plight of our existence and guilt and sadness. It very well could be. But\
  \ my thoughts during this leg of the trip were a bit less sophisticated and more\
  \ to the tune of, \"This is gross, why couldn't we have taken a plane,\" \n\nBut\
  \ somehow, seeing this allowed me to understand just how many people really live\
  \ here. This is waste and it's gross and smelly but it's also a proof of existence,\
  \ a proof of life. The heaping amounts of waste are in direct correlation with the\
  \ heaping amounts of people that share this city, this space. As you travel out\
  \ of the city, into the countryside, there are lines of rice paddies and for the\
  \ first time, air that is not consumed by the stench of waste. It is so beautiful\
  \ - in a simple, serene and peaceful way. The absence of waste means an absence\
  \ of people, or at least much fewer people. The sunshine streams in through the\
  \ window, my fellow train travellers settling into their seats, beggars in the aisles\
  \ calming their voices, everyone senses the shift in scenery. \n\nThe irony? There\
  \ is an odd feeling of isolation. \n\nAm I just a city person at heart? Is this\
  \ why I feel this way? Or maybe it's just the stark contrast of it all. By the wistful\
  \ expression of the others around me, I have a suspicion they feel it too, are thinking\
  \ about it too. \n\nWe are on a train from the densely populated Dhaka to another\
  \ smaller city called Rangpur. From there my family and I will be picked up by my\
  \ uncle to take the backroads to the little city my dad's from called Kurigram.\
  \ This entire journey should take about 10 hours - depending on how many cows we\
  \ might get stuck behind and their honour decides to let us mere humans go or not.\
  \ The trip ended up being 14 hours.\n\nThe longer the trip went on, the more this\
  \ feeling of isolation seemed to grow. I admit I have always lived my life in large\
  \ metropolitan cities so I have experienced this strange sense of being disconnected\
  \ from the world...when really I'm just in a rural place. It's funny what my biases\
  \ consider as a place \"worth\" travelling to and not based on this fictitious conception.\
  \ Suddenly it hit me - there's no garbage. No waste. At all. Hence, no proof of\
  \ life, of existence. What a weird connection to make, I know. Again, this could\
  \ have been a deep story about climate change and the plight of our existence -\
  \ but THIS is what I was thinking. \n\nThe rest of the way, I reviewed the other\
  \ places I've travelled to. Every time realizing the connection between waste and\
  \ cities like Paris, London, Toronto, Moscow, etc. How the levels of isolation and\
  \ waste were tied together. Of course, more waste just means more people. \n\nAs\
  \ it was nearing time to get off of the train, it was pitch black and around 2 AM.\
  \ The train did not actually stop, only slowed so a few passengers like us could\
  \ jump off with our luggage to cross over to the street on the other side of the\
  \ train tracks. I was the last to jump. While everyone apparently managed to both\
  \ see and avoid the garbage floating in an open sewage line I, of course, jump straight\
  \ into it. I wanted connection, figures."
