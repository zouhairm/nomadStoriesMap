Text: "Grace is a 24 year old woman is miserable with her life. She is stuck in a\
  \ rut of repetitive, mundane monotony. She hates her job working as a receptionist\
  \ and feels like her happiness lies anywhere but where she currently is. \n\nUnlike\
  \ other people her own age who take off and go traveling to Thailand for six months,\
  \ Grace could never do that. She's a normal girl who's wary of being so far from\
  \ home, scared of being alone and absolutely terrified foreign food will make her\
  \ IBS flare up causing her to make a frantic phone call home sat on a public toilet\
  \ to her mother and spending the rest of her savings on a flight back home.\n\n\
  Plus she doesn't have a bikini body or an Instagram account. In some people's eyes\
  \ she really has no reason to travel at all.\n\nBut that itch is still there. To\
  \ fly off and be someone different.\n\nDuring an extremely dull Tuesday afternoon\
  \ at work, Grace searches for get away trips and stumbles across an advert for a\
  \ company. The Company is called 'Time to Try'. They are similar to tour companies\
  \ but with a twist. They organise tours around countries designed to specifically\
  \ seek out as much adventure as possible. For example; a normal tour company will\
  \ organise for you and a group of people to have a leisurely kayak trip on a lake\
  \ then onto a local bar for a cocktail night. Time to Try will set you up with the\
  \ challenge to kayak down a river to the local bar where on arrival you find out\
  \ that you and your group are tonight's entertainment giving you ten minutes to\
  \ decide what act you're putting together. \n\nThere's one more twist. Time to Try\
  \ ask for \xA35,000 upfront. Everything is included. If you complete every challenge\
  \ put before you during the 4 weeks travel then you will receive your money back.\
  \ \n\nIn simple terms, you have nothing to lose if you do what you're told.\n\n\
  The Italian trip requires one more person to join. Grace signs up not realising\
  \ that this will be the best and worst decision she'll ever make."
