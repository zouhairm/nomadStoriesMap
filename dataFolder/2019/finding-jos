Text: "I had always thought Heaven looked like Jos, the Jos of my father\u2019s stories.\
  \ He went to university in the cold, peaceful town of hundreds of hills with farms\
  \ on every bit of ground that wasn\u2019t built on and lush flowers as weeds. In\
  \ his stories, the town shone in my mind\u2019s eye, its beauty imprinted in my\
  \ mind even as I shivered as he told of how his steaming bath water would become\
  \ icy in a few minutes and he didn\u2019t dare dawdle unless he wanted to court\
  \ a cold. \n\nI was thinking of my father when the car pulled out of the Jos Park\
  \ at Bida and winged its way to Jos. I had just spent six days in Bida, writing\
  \ and soaking up the local atmosphere and finding the parts of myself I had left\
  \ behind in 2001 when I left the city as a wary thirteen-year-old, after three years\
  \ of secondary school. \n\nThe roads were terrible, I remember my friend Tunde who\
  \ liked to complain about the roads in Southern Nigeria and told me the roads in\
  \ the North were better, he was wrong. I was wedged close to the window by the two\
  \ other passengers in the narrow station wagon that took seven passengers on each\
  \ leg of the journey to and from Jos.\n\n My camera sat at the top of my knapsack\
  \ but it was going to be very hard using the device in that cramped space and I\
  \ struggled not to cry from frustration as we drove through Kaduna, passing clouds\
  \ so low, they seemed to touch the grass-covered floor. I actually sobbed as we\
  \ passed the Kagoro hill range, the beauty of the hills wrung my heart with great\
  \ force. \n\nMy friend Steve sent me yet another message asking me about arrangements\
  \ for my accommodation in Jos and I assured him that arrangements had been made\
  \ by my friend Abiodun. He asked if he could tell his cousin in the city to expect\
  \ me regardless and be on standby to take me to a safe part of town. I was slightly\
  \ irritated by his constant prodding; didn\u2019t he think me old enough to take\
  \ care of myself? \n\nAfter passing the most beautiful road I have ever seen in\
  \ real life, the driver navigated the serpentine curves with great skill and deftness\
  \ and in a few minutes, Jos fell before my eyes and I struggled with tears. In my\
  \ second year at secondary school, I was selected to be part of a play my school\
  \ drama group was doing at Jos. On the morning of the trip, while waiting for the\
  \ bus at the dining hall in with the rest of the cast, the English teacher told\
  \ me I wouldn\u2019t be going because there was a slash in the budget. I remember\
  \ going to my room to cry and waking up the next day, the time between was a blur\
  \ even then.\n\nAbiodun\u2019s friend was not waiting for me at the park, neither\
  \ was she picking her phone calls. With great humility I called Steve to get his\
  \ cousin, this was after I had taken a cab to her end of town and she was still\
  \ incommunicado. \n\nWhile I was heading for Jos, a crisis boiled over into the\
  \ streets of Jos. I didn\u2019t know about this but my parents did and they called\
  \ me at five-minute intervals until I was safely tucked in on my wrought iron bed\
  \ which was definitely older than me. The hotel was old but it had a slight charm\
  \ that came from the hills around it, the manager even let me go up to the balcony\
  \ where I took some amazing landscape shots. \n\nOn Sunday Afternoon, I took a walk\
  \ into the city, taking hundreds of shots and asking questions about interesting\
  \ places to see. I soon found myself in the zoo where the Lions were roaring in\
  \ near harmony, other visitors \u2013 all male, shrank in fear but I got out my\
  \ phone and went live on Facebook. \n\u201CAren\u2019t you afraid?\u201D one of\
  \ the men called out. \n\u201CI\u2019m in Jos and I\u2019m alive, I\u2019m finally\
  \ alive,\u201D I muttered in reply."
