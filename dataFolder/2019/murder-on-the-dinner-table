Text: "\u201CSQUEEEEEEE!\u201D  The abalone\u2019s death cry pierced the air in our\
  \ private dinner booth, while my date sat opposite me with a soppy smile on his\
  \ face, completely oblivious to my mortification.\n\nI am grinning as I write about\
  \ that meal, warm and safe with a hot chocolate beside my writing wrist, looking\
  \ back at that birthday dinner through the rosy hues of hindsight. What is embarrassing,\
  \ a little humiliating and awkwardly funny now was a fantastically horrifying meal\
  \ then.\n\nThat particular experience is a typical cultural story that will no doubt\
  \ sound familiar to most of you. It was familiar to me too\u2014so much so that\
  \ I had an out of body experience while that poor creature died in front of me.\
  \ The real me floated above the dinner and hollered \u201Cit\u2019s happening!!\
  \ You are a foreigner in a new country. You knew you were bound to get thrown into\
  \ the deep end and here it is! Ava? AVA! Hellooooo?!\u201D\n\nMy Japanese man I\
  \ was seeing organised a surprise birthday road trip for me during my stay in Tokyo.\
  \ The two of us drove out of the city and stayed in a high-end ryokan in the mountains\
  \ with an onsen, where a lavish and traditional dinner and breakfast was served\
  \ and I had my first Japanese hot spring experience. It was a sweet idea. The onsen\
  \ was a private one, so we were able to book entry for just the two of us. I\u2019\
  m not allowed to bathe in public onsens because I have a tattoo which inks my skin\
  \ from elbow to wrist on my left hand. I wore a long-sleeved top when we checked\
  \ in to the ryokan, so we (unfairly) got away with it.\n\nVisiting an onsen often\
  \ means being paired with an elaborate, multi-course meal after your soak. We sat\
  \ in comfortable, woven yukata at our private dining table and platters of sashimi,\
  \ meats, delicately carved vegetables and small bright pickles flickered across\
  \ our table as the meal unwound into the evening. A few courses in, the waiter slid\
  \ the door open and placed two small coal burners on our table, mine right next\
  \ to my right hand, and popped a grill over the red heat. Before I had time to fantasize\
  \ about what the next dish might be, an abalone was plopped onto the crisscrossed\
  \ steel. I didn\u2019t even know what abalone was. \u201CThat\u2019s an ugly oyster,\u201D\
  \ I thought, and was ready to move on, until it started rocking back and forth.\n\
  \nHoly shit. It\u2019s still alive! Okay. Oh my god. Okay. OH MY GOD! Just ignore\
  \ it. This is such an expensive meal. Joonmo just wants me to have a nice birthday.\
  \ Wait. WAIT! What is...is it squealing? It\u2019s squealing.\n\nOf course it was\
  \ squealing. Even now I can clearly picture what its last moments on Earth were.\
  \ One idiot human loomed over it doing nothing as it was cooked alive while the\
  \ second human made puppy dog eyes across the table. Those must have been squeals\
  \ of rage as much as they were squeals of impending death. At one point it lurched\
  \ and almost toppled off the grill. My muscles twitched as I prepared to fling myself\
  \ out of the window in shame. It eventually, well... died and I pretended the whole\
  \ thing hadn\u2019t happened.\n\nI was embarrassed about my silence at first, but\
  \ now that I know myself better, I see that my empathy won out, I put my date\u2019\
  s feelings before my own and I can\u2019t fault myself too harshly for that. With\
  \ more travelling, I learned how to navigate those situations. I never judged others\
  \ for their choices and I also learned to flex my \u201Cno\u201D muscle. I came\
  \ to understand that it was perfectly fine to accept and empathise with a cultural\
  \ practice and still not take part in it.\n\nA few weeks later I was walking with\
  \ some friends through Chinatown in Bangkok.\n\u201CLunch!\u201D Reina pointed to\
  \ Shark Fin Inn.\n\u201CI\u2019m completely happy to join you two, but I won\u2019\
  t be eating any shark.\u201D I said with a smile.\nAnd that was that."
