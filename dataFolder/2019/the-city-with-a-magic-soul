Text: "The life-changing journey to the most astonishing place in Brazil\n\nIt was\
  \ the first time that I have seen soul in one place. Such a strong light, of those\
  \ to dazzle and brighten any blue day and a breathtaking landscape.The land of Brazilian\u2019\
  s poets could have no other synonym but spell and enchantment. Morro de S\xE3o Paulo\
  \ is a small island located in Salvador - the capital of Bahia. After 4 hours traveling\
  \ by boat from the capital, adjectives falls away to describe the outlook that is\
  \ summed up in a beach of white sand and the crystalline water in the sea, besides\
  \ the warmth welcoming of the Bahia people.\n\nOn one side, the people smiling and\
  \ laughing at life. On the other, the colors and lively streets. When you step on\
  \ Morro, everything starts to make sense. At every corner of the island there are\
  \ inns and restaurants that have become business of Frenchmen and Englishmen who,\
  \ after experiencing the paradise, simply refused to return home. Between smiles\
  \ and an outing, I meet Maria, and I dare ask her why Morro de S\xE3o Paulo is so\
  \ incredible that it differs from all other destinations in the world.\n\n \"Sweetie:\
  \ here, the dawn and the nightfall are like any part of the world. But with the\
  \ brightness and intensity that things and people have loved each other all night\
  \ long. \" I agree with her with a smile and an overpowering tear.\n\nThe streets\
  \ are wide and sloping. There are colors on the walls of the inns and a vivid smell\
  \ of nature everywhere. Cats are able to joy the liberty. There are so many of them.\
  \ In just two hours of walking, it is possible to know the island from one end to\
  \ the other. However, not to unravel all the mysteries there. At sunset, it is not\
  \ uncommon to observe people sitting at the edge of the beach to prize the landscape\
  \ of the sun \u201Csaying goodbye\u201D to the island. Yes, it seems that the sun\
  \ works selectly for Bahia, because even in winter time, there is no cold and no\
  \ rain.\n\nA tough decision: sleep. The volition is to admire every single detail\
  \ of the island. However, finding warmth shelter as peculiar as the island is effortless.\
  \ The straw house with a huge bed was the one chosen this time. Located on the edge\
  \ of the beach, in the southern corner of the island, in an area of \u200B\u200B\
  15 thousand meters of tropical forest. In this corner, the woods are preserved with\
  \ fruit trees and a collection of native palms that compose a natural breeding ground\
  \ for birds that fill the air with harmony of wild symphony. \n\nDuring the day,\
  \ there are activities for all tastes. Since outdoor walks, adventures, sea activities\
  \ to zipline. After some adrenaline, is time to eat. I go to Ant\xF4nio and Maria's\
  \ restaurant. Resembling a grandma's house. I decided to snoop the kitchen and I\
  \ offered help. She smiles at me and tells to sit down to taste the most scrumptious\
  \ lunch in the world. The Bahian seasoning is something unique and can delight almost\
  \ all palates. I start my lunch with \u201Cacaraj\xE9\u201D. A typical Bahia\u2019\
  s dish made with with beans, onions and the famous touch of azeite de dend\xEA -\
  \ \u201Cpalm oil\u201D.\n\"Enjoy your meal. Haste makes waste\". says Dona Maria,\
  \ proud of her dish that fascinate every visitor.\n\nBahia is more than poetry.\
  \ It goes beyond the idea of \u200B\u200Bbeing just a tourist destination. This\
  \ place is vigorous. Sit down at the edge of that the beach means a life reflection\
  \ about goals and life\u2019s purposes. And most importantly: to understand what\
  \ happens when the vitality of a place, the strength of the nature and kindly people\
  \ meet."
