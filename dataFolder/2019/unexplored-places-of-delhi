Text: "The name of Delhi crops up contemporary and traditional tourist spots like\
  \ India Gate, Red Fort, Raj Ghat etc. but many times we are on a look out of Unexplored\
  \ Places Near Delhi which retain the charm and magic of the old world. The city\
  \ holds many hidden gems which can be unveiled only by the seekers of unexplored.\
  \ There are many such offbeat places in Delhi which as a heritage city, Delhi can\
  \ boast of. Let us explore them here which you can add to your bucket list subsequently\
  \ during next visit to Delhi through Palace on Wheels.                 Maharaja\
  \ Agrasen ki Baoli \u2013 Built during the Tughlaq period, this ancient wonder traces\
  \ its origins back to the era of the great king Maharaja Agrasen. The front of the\
  \ baoli showcases the beautifully designed architecture of the step well which consists\
  \ of 108 steps, which are divided into three levels. The meticulously crafted steps\
  \ are visible in this picture which clicked from the end point of the baoli, which\
  \ has dimensions of 60mx15m. Located on Hailey Road, near Connaught Place in Delhi,\
  \ this site is undoubtedly a popular name among couples. As you approach the end\
  \ point of the baoli, you will also find a semi-secretive step well located at the\
  \ place where the stairs end. The step well is covered from the top, and a small\
  \ opening leads to a unique view of the well which is adjusted in a very compact\
  \ space.\nHijron ka Khangah \u2013 The opening gate of this underrated Islamic monument\
  \ is a brilliant example of the beauty and excellency of the exquisite Mughal &\
  \ Persian architecture and design that prevailed in most of North India in the 15th\
  \ century, the time during which this monument was created under the leadership\
  \ of Sikander Lodi. The entrance of the premises is made up in the form of a narrow\
  \ entrance gate which leads to the white marble steps that give way to the pristine\
  \ white-colored tombs. This pre-Mughal monument of the Lodi period is famous for\
  \ the tombs of the hijras or eunuchs that were buried during the reign of the Lodi\
  \ Dynasty. The tombs are white-colored, and these pictures have been clicked artistically\
  \ from the small terrace that adjoins the graveyard. All this is a testament to\
  \ the fact that that the eunuchs were a much-respected community at that time. The\
  \ monument is now owned and maintained by the Hijras of the Turk man Gate, and they\
  \ also pay visits on religious days to distribute food to the poor and destitute.\n\
  \nThe design of the tombs signifies the level of spiritual importance that has been\
  \ given to this hidden Sufi cemetery. Further, the hijras of that period were also\
  \ given religious & powerful positions in the era of the Mughals in the 16th All-in-all,\
  \ forty-nine hijras were buried beneath the white tombs, and a much larger ornate\
  \ tomb is built to honor & pay respect to a eunuch named Miyan Saheb. The mixture\
  \ of the well-balanced & proportionate mix of the Indo-Persian architecture is used\
  \ for providing a smooth appearance to the monument & it has been well-documented\
  \ in various books like \u201CKhanqah,\u201D Aparna Das\u2019s \u201CRetreating\
  \ into the Sufi\u2019s shadow,\u201D etc\n\n\nNaini Lake \u2013 The well-maintained,\
  \ wonderfully constructed, and a soothing view for the eyes, The Naini Lake is a\
  \ one of its kind of tourist spot in Model Town. The lake provides a beautiful and\
  \ memorable experience as it is a spot that helps the visitors in detaching from\
  \ the stillness of the concrete jungles in Delhi. It is perfect for couples, old\
  \ age people & children to come and relax in the evening, as well as morning. The\
  \ lake is the ideal spot for fishing, chilling with friends, and creating unforgettable\
  \ experiences for families and couples. The people can visit the Naini Lake by simply\
  \ taking the yellow line of the metro, and it is at a walking distance away from\
  \ the metro station. Boating in Naini Lake came under controversy as the Delhi government\
  \ decided to shut down boating services due to North Delhi Municipal Corporation\
  \ refusing to co-operate. Whenever you visit Naini Lake, you will find the place\
  \ crowded with lovebirds (couples), all across the jogging track that"
