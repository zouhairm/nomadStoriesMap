Text: "I have been traveling all my life from 14 years old to Greece when i was a\
  \ child for summer camps as i have been born and raised in Palestine in middle of\
  \ war , unstable situation civil offences here and there , unsafe place to live\
  \ learn and go with your day through getting a normal childhood as everybody raised\
  \ up in the world , so for me traveling alone as a 14 years old to another country\
  \ that i don\u2019t know their language well and my english was so weak comparing\
  \ by today was having a strange feeling but needs to be done for me as i have the\
  \ self motivated and the soul to discover my 2nd half place which is fruitfull for\
  \ me full of colors beach , culture and history , i\u2019ve been always proud to\
  \ be Greek as long as being proud to be Palestinian at the same time , when people\
  \ asks me where i\u2019m i from ! I was answering Greek Palestinian till i learned\
  \ later on that an open world full of freedom as we are missing the breath of freedom\
  \ in Palestine being not connected to only a land !! It\u2019s a nation whom lives\
  \ there , people u deal with everyday , a country which is open for you new horizons\
  \ , open it hands and give you new chances , so i start thinking that the whole\
  \ world is mine , whom cares about the boarders any more ? Whom cares about the\
  \ check point any more ? Where ever people are warm is my country ! Where ever people\
  \ is smiling thats my country ! I don\u2019t care about where people from anymore\
  \ , their color , thier names , their religion or ethnic never been for me important\
  \ and in that i believe and i\u2019ll keep being a believer after all for me that\
  \ path was a way to heaven where the sun shake hands with the sea ! Where you taste\
  \ the peacfull with the smell of the Greek food ! With every single Tree that our\
  \ grandfathers plant in this area yoy feel the history , when we was going to a\
  \ journy with kids from all over the world with the same case being dual nationalities\
  \ i learnt to love others , having harmony with them and looking forward , it was\
  \ and still a bright place which is where i love to be more than any where else\
  \ !! I\u2019ve been in dubai , saudi arabia , cyprus , italy , now i\u2019m living\
  \ in London i passed for a travel to Thailand , Malaysia, Indonesia for manytimes\
  \ i never seen a lovely place so true , people deals from the heart , with kindness\
  \ , respect and feelings like what Greece is , i\u2019m sure it\u2019s available\
  \ inside us everywhere ! We only need to look after it and grow it up till we see\
  \ it everywhere ! \nSo many fake countries full of high buildings full of clouds\
  \ and fog and it\u2019s really cold places not realy as you thought about it before\
  \ doing your visit ! You think it\u2019s a perfect place but you end up with disappointment\
  \ as there is nothing perfect in this world ! It\u2019s perfect once we start convincing\
  \ ourseleves that the negativity is positive , once we find the happines in saying\
  \ good morning to a stranger , once we help each other without expecting something\
  \ back ! Once we forget where we are from !! \nMoney would return one day ! But\
  \ time will never return , thats why i\u2019m a travler , i love to travel and i\u2019\
  m inspired by people whom having no reason even to catch up wih a small place calling\
  \ it a homeland and never accepts others ! If yoy are a traveler the whole universe\
  \ is your homeland \nThe story is complicated but simplicity makes it more exciting,\
  \ make it spread out and go through to the heart directly ! \nI hate no body , i\
  \ hate no where , what i believe in is we are here for a reason and that reason\
  \ is doing goodness where ever we are , where ever we land \nPlanting a tree better\
  \ than burning them , at the same time lighting up a candel better than damn the\
  \ darkness ! Life is short so travel young before it ends up in a place that u belongs\
  \ to ."
