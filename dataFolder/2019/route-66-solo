Text: "As I plan my one to two week trip across the country, leaving from Wisconsin,\
  \ I\u2019ve decided I want go old school with it. So what\u2019s the most historic\
  \ and old school roads in country? Route 66 is of course.There are many songs and\
  \ stories about this road. And I decided I wanted one of my own, now I\u2019m not\
  \ very musically inclined, but I can write a halfway decent story. \n\n\tFor my\
  \ Route 66 solo adventure I made the decision to this adventure will be solely the\
  \ classic Route 66. No McDonalds or trinket stores. Just small businesses and family\
  \ owned dinners. This would be one of my best decisions for my trip. Along with\
  \ driving my 2004 Green Honda Element, with the back seats removed. With my Toaster\
  \ (the Hondas nickname) I was able to place a small mattress on one side with my\
  \ duffel bag and scratched up red Coleman cooler on the other side. A classic old\
  \ metal Coleman cooler is the best road trip gear I could recommend. KOA\u2019s\
  \ were the main stops for me, most of them allowed me to take up a tent space with\
  \ it. My other stops were Motel 6\u2019s and cheaper motels or hotels. Save money\
  \ for gas and experiences. \n\n\t The Main things I really loved about my trip was\
  \ the food, and odd roadside attractions. My favorite food on this trip would have\
  \ to the fish tacos from \u201CThe Roost\u201D in Shamrock, TX. They had a slice\
  \ of avocado on each and the shells were seasoned perfectly. The Fish was also perfect,\
  \ crunchy outside with a very nice and flavorful fish on the inside. The staff was\
  \ also very nice, on my way out a waitress and I talked a little bit and got on\
  \ the subject of grape soda. I asked her if she\u2019d ever had a Spechers Grape\
  \ soda, she said no. So I went out to the Toaster and grabbed my last one for her.\
  \ Which I\u2019d only brought four on the trip, and hadn\u2019t seen any Sprechers\
  \ anywhere else. I hoped she enjoyed it as much as I enjoyed \u201CThe Roost\u2019\
  s\u201D fish tacos. As for roadside attractions the Catoosa Whale was my favorite,\
  \ I couldn\u2019t tell you why, I just thought it was really cool.\n\n\t\n\n\tOn\
  \ my Route 66 Trip I did miss some of the roadside stops, but I hope to do the venture\
  \ again some time soon. Hopefully with a passenger by my side this time though,\
  \ singing songs in the car only lasts so long. I also learned a lot history about\
  \ the road and the towns built from it, along with the not-so-historical fact that\
  \ \u201CLove\u2019s\u201D gas stations have the better windshield cleaner. While\
  \ driving it\u2019s really nice to stop and enjoy the view, whether be the dessert,\
  \ or a city, they\u2019re both amazing. I recommend everyone make the historical\
  \ journey at least once in their lives, personally I learned some things about myself,\
  \ I think you might as well."
