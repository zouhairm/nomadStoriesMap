Text: "I awoke to screams echoing down the hallway from my bed, as I opened my eyes\
  \ I could tell that was a cry of grief. I had heard it many times in my life, the\
  \ undeniable sound that pierces the depths of your soul. Everyone in my room quickly\
  \ jumped out of our beds trying to make sense of what was going on. As we ran down\
  \ the hallway our eyes were met with the sights of our hostel hostess in front of\
  \ the t.v. shaking uncontrollably. She fell to her knee\u2019s as she watched the\
  \ footage of what remained of a plane burning on the ground.\n\nThat day I watched\
  \ an entire city mourn the death of their President and cry in fear of what the\
  \ future held. People hung their flags from their balconies as a declaration stating\
  \ \u201CYou are not alone.\u201D I had come to fall in love with this city, with\
  \ these beautiful people, and their captivating stories. The day before I stood\
  \ at a street vendors display of her handcrafted pottery. I listened to her tell\
  \ me how she learned to allow God to form her life, just as she did with the clay.\
  \ I thought of the young boy who took my hand and proudly showed me the finished\
  \ masterpiece he made from recycled materials. Now the Poland they once knew had\
  \ changed forever in an instant. \n\nWhen I had arrived in Poznan I thought I would\
  \ walk down the cobblestone streets and find adventure. I thought I would take in\
  \ the sights of beautiful buildings standing tall. I thought I would taste their\
  \ culture with excitement. What I found instead was so much more. I saw humanity\
  \ gather together in the face of great pain and lift one another up in hope. I had\
  \ never witnessed patriotism like I did that day. To the people of Poland, it wasn\u2019\
  t just a country they resided in. It was a place where they found their freedom.\
  \ It was a place where wars were won. The blood and sweat of their ancestors were\
  \ poured out on this land. The plane going down was a symbol of all they had to\
  \ lose. What rose from the ashes was a promise to not let death overcome.\n\nAs\
  \ I sat on the floor that morning amongst people I didn\u2019t know and took the\
  \ hands of strangers I was invited into a sacred space. A place where language and\
  \ backgrounds didn\u2019t matter. All of our human hearts had faced unbearable loss\
  \ at one point in our lives. We all knew the strength of our empathy. Together with\
  \ each tear that dropped it created a river for those who thirsted for comfort to\
  \ drink from. That day I was reminded of the resilience of people and the power\
  \ that is held when we choose to be with one another no matter the circumstance.\
  \ We are better together because when we feel so lost we need each other to help\
  \ us find our way again."
