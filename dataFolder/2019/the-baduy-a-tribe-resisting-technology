Text: "\u201CWhere do the kids go to school?\u201D I asked Kang Narsan, my host, after\
  \ dinner.\n \u201CNo Baduy attends school unless the person wants to be dismissed\
  \ from the Baduy community.\u201D He explained to me how strict the rule is. \n\u201C\
  So, every Baduy is illiterate?\u201D I asked more\n\u201COnly a few of the Outer\
  \ Baduy are able to read, but the Inner Baduy are totally illiterate.\u201D \n\n\
  The Baduy, an isolated tribe of 11 million living in the jungle mountains resist\
  \ any new influences from outside the might affect their community.  Influences\
  \ include education, social concepts, beliefs, and modernization. Sophisticated\
  \ technology is strictly prohibited in this area. They are determined that their\
  \ beliefs and customs will remain the same for all time, despite the rapid changes\
  \ in the outside world. \n\nAs a result, there is no school, no hospital, no transportation,\
  \ no electricity, no internet connection, nothing in the form of a machine. Even\
  \ basic household equipment must be handmade. \n\nHowever, a few of the Baduy are\
  \ not as strict in preserving this tradition. They have made small changes: some\
  \ wear sandals, buy household equipment from markets, take public transportation\
  \ to town to sell things. Because they have broken with tradition, they call themselves\
  \ the Outer Baduy. Those who uphold the strict traditions, people who are willing\
  \ to walk miles rather than take transportation are called the Inner Baduy.\n\n\
  From the bus terminal I trekked for an hour up and down the hills until I saw some\
  \ small houses at the top of a hill. I took a little break to gather my courage\
  \ to across a stream. I was excited because crossing the stream meant that I was\
  \ getting closer.\n\nAs we arrived Kang Narsan, my Outer Baduy host, welcomed me\
  \ and two friends warmly. \n\n\u201CKang Narsan, how many villages are considered\
  \ Baduy?\u201D I asked\n\u201CThere are about 60 villages of Outer Baduy and three\
  \ villages of Inner Baduy\u201D he replied.\n\u201CThe same construction design\
  \ is used for all the houses?\u201D\n\u201CYes, sameness is very important for Baduy.\
  \ Everyone wears the same color, and settles in the same type of house.\u201D \n\
  \nThe Baduy construct their houses using the bamboo materials available in the forest.\
  \ They build their villages near the river.\n\nAfter bathing in the river, a minute\u2019\
  s walk from the village, I prepared my sleeping space, a floor mat woven from plant\
  \ leaves. Slowly the dusk turned into dark. It was a peaceful night, with no sound\
  \ from any direction, or from any living being. So quiet. \n\nThe night was without\
  \ light or mobile phones. I was aware of my body and my thoughts, without any distraction\
  \ from others. It helped me find peace in myself. \n\nMy friend and I slept outside,\
  \ on the veranda. The night grew cooler, and I was glad that I had brought a cover\
  \ to keep me warm. Some things I most appreciated about this village was the fact\
  \ that mosquitos don\u2019t exist there, perhaps because the villagers keep their\
  \ environment clean.\n\nIn the morning the village was on the move, with everyone\
  \ walking to their farms. I saw groups of three or more people, both kids and the\
  \ elderly, went to the farms. With no entertainment to keep them at home, work on\
  \ the farm was a community activity. \n\nTo satisfy my curiosity I trekked up a\
  \ nearby hill to see another village. Kang Narsan was right: in this second village,\
  \ I found the same stone pavement along the river, up and down the hill, and saw\
  \ that the construction of the village houses was the same. \n\n\u201CHow do you\
  \ live with other Baduy? Do you sometimes fight?\u201D I asked Kang Narsan.\nKang\
  \ Narsan explained how they live in harmony in simple lifestyles.  \u201CFight for\
  \ what? We equally have the same, so we are always at peace and happy,\u201D \n\n\
  For some people, happiness means possessing many things. Others are happy when they\
  \ have more than others have. The biggest lesson I learned from visiting the Baduy\
  \ people is that happiness and peacefulness are not determined by what we have,\
  \ but by what we can make and by how we share with the people surround us."
