Text: "My last travel was about being in somewhere different, because my own country\
  \ is so big, and I didn't know everywhere around. I just subscribe myself in a website\
  \ called Wordpackers, that provides a really incredible experience, as a volunteer.\
  \ I just added myself in a Hostel, called Social Hostel, in the south of my country.\
  \ The name of the city I spend 21 days was Curitiba. It was my second experience\
  \ in travelling alone, and as long as I love travelling, of course it was awesome.\
  \ \nAs a Hostel, the experience and direct contact with different people is countless.\
  \ I could have moments with people from all world. There was a day that I simply\
  \ waked up with a German traveller in my bedroom, took a breakfeast with an Argentinian,\
  \ watched a Korean talking lovely korean words with the dog that lives in the hostel,\
  \ and suddenly I just felt so blessed with all that things happening in just a morning.\
  \ \nAt the hostel I was able to cleaning, washing and cooking. I also worked as\
  \ a recepcionist, and it was my favorite part. Every time that a new person from\
  \ another country just got inside there, I was embracing the challenge of talking\
  \ with a person completely different from me. I really loves this magic of travelling\
  \ and knowing people, learning from them, laughing with them and also being a normal\
  \ human being with them. \nI usually though about other country people as a different\
  \ human, but we are all the same. The same will of being happy and having an incredible\
  \ life just put myself with another countless people around the world. At that moment\
  \ I realize that I can also travel everywhere and do anything, and it's so inspiring.\
  \ \nTravelling alone is a self knowledge process that everybody must addept. Being\
  \ alone, or like in my case, without people that are normally in my comfort life\
  \ at home, is an way of watching myself, and how I normally am when nobody is looking\
  \ or judging me. I liked being kind of alone, (since I was with a lot of people\
  \ everytime) so I could really analize myself and every single internall thinks\
  \ I have for a lot of days. \nI am so thankful about this opportunity of travelling,\
  \ and I will always preserve this moments inside my soul."
