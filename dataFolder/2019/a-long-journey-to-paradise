Text: "I opened my eyes and lied in bed, as the mist of sleep cleared and I remembered\
  \ exactly where I was. My boyfriend was sleeping by my side. I heard voices, some\
  \ laughter, the sound of a bus trudging in the mud. I took a peek out the window.\
  \ There was a school across the street. It had been raining all night in this small\
  \ Ecuadorian village and some children were playing in the puddles that had formed\
  \ everywhere. I went back to bed and thought about the previous day. Did all that\
  \ really happen?\n\nA week ago in Quilotoa, we mentioned to an Ecuadorian lady that\
  \ we wanted to visit some \u201Cauthentic\u201D sea village. She suggested going\
  \ to Mompiche, a beautiful fishing village, far from crowds. We would love it. She\
  \ seemed to like it so much that we decided, without any further information, to\
  \ take her advice.\n\nIt would be a long journey in four different buses, but we\
  \ didn\u2019t care. We felt adventurous. After leaving Quilotoa that morning, we\
  \ arrived in Quito in the afternoon for an 8-hour wait before our next bus. It was\
  \ a bit long but we were in good spirits and planned to sleep on the bus. However,\
  \ our plan was frustrated when we got on the bus at midnight: the music was so loud\
  \ it would be impossible to get any sleep. We were told afterwards this was pretty\
  \ usual in buses there and, surprisingly, nobody complained about it.\n\nWe arrived\
  \ in Esmeraldas under a driving rain. We ran 200 meters with our backpacks to try,\
  \ unsuccessfully, not to get soaking wet. After a couple more hours wait, we finally\
  \ took our last bus. Except for a Spanish woman, we were the only tourists in the\
  \ almost empty bus and we started growing uneasy as we realized we didn\u2019t know\
  \ exactly where we were going.\n\nMompiche isn\u2019t far from Esmeraldas, but to\
  \ our discontent, the trip took longer than we expected. Going through a rural area,\
  \ the bus stopped every few kilometers in what seemed to be the middle of nowhere\
  \ to let banana harvesters hop on. All of them had machetes so keeping a low profile\
  \ seemed like a good idea.\nWe were just a few kilometers away from our destination\
  \ when the bus let out a sudden metallic groan and simply refused to move forward.\
  \ My good mood was lost for good. Forty minutes later, perhaps persuaded by the\
  \ machetes, the bus set off.\n\nMompiche wasn\u2019t what we expected. There were\
  \ no hotels in sight and our only hope for finding one was the Spanish woman. Unfortunately\
  \ she had a reservation on a nearby island. A boat was waiting for her and she disappeared\
  \ in a blink. We walked down the main street and entered the only place with a Bed\
  \ and Breakfast sign we saw. A rickety staircase led to a poorly lit corridor with\
  \ many doors. The wooden building looked very much like a horror movie hostel, and\
  \ the stale smell only confirmed this suspicion. As we fled into the street, it\
  \ started raining again. I was about to burst into tears. Well, I actually did.\
  \ We had been traveling for more than 36 hours, we were not in the tropical paradise\
  \ I had imagined, it was raining and we had nowhere to stay.\n\nIn that moment,\
  \ one of the workers who had traveled in our bus came toward us. He said his brother\
  \ worked in a nearby hotel; he could take us there. Although we couldn\u2019t stop\
  \ staring at the machete he was using to point in the direction of his invitation,\
  \ the longing for a dry place and a bed beat the distrust and we followed him. After\
  \ a short walk in the rain, we arrived at a new, clean and cozy place. It was heaven!\
  \ I\u2019m sure the receptionist had never seen two guests so thankful.\n\nAfter\
  \ breakfast, we went out to tour the village: the black beach, the island of Jupiter\
  \ and its crabs, the wooden houses, the sea that in the afternoons resembled a quiet\
  \ swimming pool. The following days in Mompiche were unforgettable. Definitely,\
  \ the journey had been worth it."
