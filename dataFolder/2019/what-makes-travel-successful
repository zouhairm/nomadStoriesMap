Text: "It is in many ways difficult for me to consider the 10 days I once spent in\
  \ India - an interlude about a third of the way into a year-long solo round-the-world\
  \ trip - anything but a failure. Chief among my sins as a bad traveler: I didn't\
  \ go to the Taj Mahal. In fact, I didn't go much of anywhere.\nI landed in New Delhi\
  \ at the start of November 2016 with less than a fortnight until I needed to make\
  \ my way to Nepal to meet a guided trekking group and, more importantly, my boyfriend\
  \ who was coming to the other side of the world to see me after nearly five months\
  \ apart. That light at the end of the tunnel meant I had to spend much of my time\
  \ in India working remotely so I'd be able to fully enjoy those weeks unplugged\
  \ in the Himalayas. While I worked, I waited on a government approval I needed to\
  \ book train tickets online - a plan advised by more than one travel blog I had\
  \ read in preparation for the trip. I waited... and waited, and as the date for\
  \ my flight to Nepal loomed ever closer, I started to panic. It was already Tuesday\
  \ - just two days left for me to make it to Agra. Just as I resolved to go to the\
  \ train station the next day and handle things in person, all hell broke loose.\
  \ The government suddenly announced it was recalling all 500 and 1000 rupee notes.\
  \ As of midnight that night, these banknotes would be worth no more than the paper\
  \ they were printed on. The entire country had just three hours to storm banks and\
  \ ATMs to make the exchange in a rush of Great Depression proportions. Banks closed\
  \ the next day to cope, and I was left without enough money to cover the cost of\
  \ the train ticket and no way of securing more. I had worked myself to the bone\
  \ for a week, and poured everything I could into solving the problem so I could\
  \ take one wonderful experience out of a low point of my RTW trip. And I had gotten\
  \ nowhere. It's hard not to consider that a failure.\nInstead, however, I learned\
  \ to redefine what marked a success in my travels. While out to lunch one afternoon,\
  \ a young local woman near my age was seated at my table and asked if I would watch\
  \ her bag while she washed her hands. We quickly got to talking over a thali, mainly\
  \ about books and about everyone's favorite topic in 2016 -- American politics.\
  \ I have experienced few things as surreal as watching the election of Donald Trump\
  \ unfold from afar. To be away from your home country as it unravels in unexpected\
  \ ways... it is nothing short of bizarre. Connecting with Sujata was grounding in\
  \ many ways amidst all the chaos and seeming failure of that week. \nI can't say\
  \ what the experience of seeing the Taj Mahal might have given me as I moved on\
  \ from my time in India, but Sujata and I have remained friends for years. In fact,\
  \ she is one of the few people I met on my RTW trip with whom I've kept in regular\
  \ contact at all. If we travel for experiences, memories and, most importantly,\
  \ connections, perhaps I'm not a failure after all. I'm not always a great traveler\
  \ on paper - I'm the sort of traveler who goes to India and does nothing particular,\
  \ doesn't even see the Taj. But my travels are a part of me all the same and that\
  \ comes with its own kind of success."
