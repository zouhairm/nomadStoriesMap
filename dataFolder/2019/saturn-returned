Text: "When we are close to our 29th birthday, a comic revolution tends to happen\
  \ to a few people: The Saturn Return. Maybe a few people know about it and tend\
  \ to believe it, so things do happen; others might just live without noticing it\
  \ happening to them; truth is, I felt it like an earthquake. I tried to run away\
  \ from it and lived in Brighton, United Kingdom, for about 2 months. What I didn't\
  \ know a the time was that The Saturn Return will fit in your luggage and will go\
  \ anywhere you try to escape to. \nSo there I was, a workaholic not working, taking\
  \ 2 months to study. Most of all, 2 months that I was away from my house, my surroundings,\
  \ S\xE3o Paulo, the city I claimed my own and everything else that I was running\
  \ away from. A new place, a new country, meeting new people, learning new things,\
  \ blowing my head with new ideas. The excitement of everything that was about to\
  \ come seemed to fill myself and erase the old. There I was, ready to be new, ready\
  \ to start over, ready to experience.\nOn the first day I woke up, put on new clothes,\
  \ tried on the make up I had seen girls using on the streets, put on my shoes and\
  \ left. As a person, ready for the new, I didn't expect to find myself there. Those\
  \ were new clothes, new face, new place. Why was myself there again? I looked in\
  \ the mirror, and there I was again. That dress could never know it was me, how\
  \ did it find me out?\nFor the 2 months that followed, all the new things came down\
  \ to being all about myself again. That was me, no matter the clothes, the environment,\
  \ the weather. It was me, all along, and The Saturn Return wanted to show me that\
  \ I could go anywhere in this world, I would find myself there. And even if I wore\
  \ the color I didn't like, I'd still be me."
