Text: "I didn\u2019t know what to expect when I touched down in Marrakesh late at\
  \ night and with only a carry-on bag slung over my shoulder. The air I pulled into\
  \ my lungs was dry and dusty. Around me people were wearing loose garments that\
  \ seemed to flow as they moved. I suddenly felt conscious of my shaved head and\
  \ boyish body against their elegant and elongated frames.\nAt Immigration the border\
  \ guard eyed me: \u201Cwhere are you going?\u201D he said\n\u201CThe Sahara Desert.\u201D\
  \ \nHe raised his eyebrows and let me through.\n\nStepping into the Arrivals hall,\
  \ I walked into a crowd that was humming in a language I could not understand. My\
  \ bus, when I found it, trundled through the warm night, weaving deftly through\
  \ the old streets in the labyrinthine city. The sandy-coloured buildings leant sleepily\
  \ against one another and from their mouths burst shops and restaurants selling\
  \ every and any kind of food and merchandise. Everywhere: streets, shops, and doorways\
  \ were bustling with people laughing, talking and gesturing to one another \u2013\
  \ foreigners and locals alike. This city was teeming with life. \n\nUpon reaching\
  \ the Jemaa el-Fnaa, I exited the bus and wandered in the general direction of my\
  \ youth hostel. Around me, stalls were selling roasted potatoes, orange juice, and\
  \ Moroccan curry. I saw a man luring a snake from a basket with a low melodious\
  \ tune, while another pulled a monkey along the street by a chain fastened around\
  \ its neck. I watched as a woman peddled baby turtles that were laid out squirming\
  \ on a mat to a group of tourists. The back-lanes of the market were lined with\
  \ still more stalls with leather bags and shoes spilling off of groaning tables.\n\
  \nAt the edge of the market I knocked on the heavy, wooden hostel door. A local\
  \ woman with a lined face let me in and gave me hot peppermint tea. Although the\
  \ outside was indistinguishable from the other buildings, the inside was bursting\
  \ with colour \u2013 red, orange, and green walls, with warm yellow tiles on the\
  \ floor. Shisha pipes were scattered around low-tables and the air was thick, sweet,\
  \ and spicy. I sipped my tea and pulled out my bus ticket to the Sahara. A 5am start.\n\
  \n***\n\nI woke to the sound of the mosque calling people to prayer. I dressed in\
  \ the dark and crept from the room, the little bag slung over my shoulder. Aboard\
  \ the bus I saw that we were a mixture of people: I heard American accents and saw\
  \ bright blue eyes, I heard Spanish and saw tanned skin, I heard an English accent\
  \ and saw a man and woman dressed like John Lennon and Yoko Ono. We were a mixed\
  \ bag. I smiled and took my seat at the back.\nThe sun was just starting to rise\
  \ as we reached the Atlas mountains, not far out of Marrakesh. The bus which had\
  \ been buzzing with anticipatory chatter fell silent. The jagged peaks of the rocky\
  \ mountains were glowing in baby-pink.\n\nThe mountains spat us into a vast, arid\
  \ desert, which shimmered under the hot Moroccan sun. The bus pushed on until the\
  \ ground began to undulate into sand dunes, which towered high on either side of\
  \ the road. We slowed to a stop, and as I got off the bus and onto my camel, I realised\
  \ that I had never been farther from home. I touched the back of my camel\u2019\
  s dry, cracked neck, and looked around. The sand of the dunes around was quickly\
  \ deepening from gold to scarlet to a rich, ruby red as they caught the sun\u2019\
  s final rays. The last image I saw before night engulfed us completely was John\
  \ Lennon\u2019s lean silhouette walking the ridge of a sand-dune. \n\nWhen we arrived\
  \ at the campsite, I climbed to the top of the highest sand-dune I could see. I\
  \ thought of how far I had come in only twenty-four hours, and how far I had to\
  \ go. The moon was so bright it cast a ghostly light over the sand-dunes rolling\
  \ endlessly into the dark. I shivered in the night desert air and smiled, wondering\
  \ where I would be tomorrow."
