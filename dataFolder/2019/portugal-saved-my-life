Text: "I didn\u2019t expect to find myself in Portugal. I didn\u2019t expect to grow\
  \ in Portugal. In January I traveled to Europe for the first time. Now, if someone\
  \ would have told me before taking off at LAX that my trip to Europe would change\
  \ my life I most likely would have disregarded everything said to me. Before my\
  \ trip, I was suffering from depersonalization. Every day of my life for two years\
  \ felt the exact same. I remembered reading in a book that traveling is the best\
  \ remedy for depression and anxiety. I needed more stimulation in my life. And oh\
  \ man, I definitely got it. I joined a month long study abroad program in Madrid,\
  \ Spain. But this story. This story is about the neighboring country of Portugal.\
  \ During my trip I booked a week long visit to Lisbon, Portugal. I knew a little\
  \ bit about Lisbon from having watched a travel documentary about it. I knew that\
  \ the city was colorful. I knew that pastel de nata is the most traditional pastry\
  \ in Lisbon. I knew things. I thought I knew things. I got off my flight at almost\
  \ midnight. Needless to say, as a foreigner in a new country I was a little skeptical\
  \ about getting a cab to my hotel but at midnight, you don\u2019t have a lot of\
  \ options. I took a cab to my hotel and prepared for my week of exploration in Portugal.\
  \ Nothing could have prepared me for the next day I would have. On my first full\
  \ day in Lisbon I woke up, got ready, and headed out to eat breakfast. In the cutest\
  \ pastry shop I sat my belongings down and began to order. As I took my receipt\
  \ and turned back over to my belongings, I suddenly had none. They were gone. I\
  \ felt defeated. I could not even force myself to care that I had just lost my wallet,\
  \ keys, phone, etc. I felt numb. How could this happen to me? And how could I even\
  \ begin to figure it out? There I was in Lisbon eating a crossaint without a dollar\
  \ or means of communication with anyone I know. As I typed that sentence now, I\
  \ realize all over again how serendipitous that moment was. I was suppose to be\
  \ in Lisbon without restrictions like money and electronics. And I didn\u2019t even\
  \ know it. I spent the week doing things that were free or almost free, that motivated\
  \ me to social, and that really tested every certainty I had. The story of my week\
  \ in Portugal feels like a never ending one. The people I met, the kindness I was\
  \ shown, and the security I felt in that city fills my heart a hundred times over.\
  \ I owe that city something. Traveling back to Portugal and getting the opportunity\
  \ to benefit their society would be the world to me. Since my experience in Lisbon\
  \ I\u2019ve reduced 60% of my belongings, cancelled all monthly subscriptions(except\
  \ my bills sadly), and have spiritually chosen a different path in life. And I owe\
  \ it all to whoever stole my belongings in pastry shop."
