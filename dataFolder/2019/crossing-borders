Text: "Although I knew where Ramallah was on the map and what bus should I take to\
  \ get there, the information on the bus station wasn\u2019t very specific: go the\
  \ Old City. So I went. It was saturday, Shabbat, and I decided to head to Palestine\
  \ as Israel would be in its rest day, therefore, it was no surprise to find a mostly\
  \ arab crowd there. \n\nWalking beside the Damascus Gate boardwalk was like entering\
  \ Palestine in advance. Noisy and colourful sellers sold everything from falafel\
  \ to fabric to chinese toys. Women on their burqas got out of buses from other cities,\
  \ getting ready to their shopping day. And unlike any other gate to the Old City,\
  \ many military soldiers stood with their guns pointed out the walls. \n\nI kept\
  \ going forward searching for the information - mostly inconclusive. After trying\
  \ two wront stations, I finally got the right directions. I knew I was headed the\
  \ correct way because of street signs, but not for the reason one might think. In\
  \ Israel, the way language overlaps is an interesting way to easily identify where\
  \ you are. The mainstream is hebrew, english and the arabic. But as you go into\
  \ the eastern part of Jerusalem, you will see that order reversed. I kept walking\
  \ and street signs started showing only arabic and english texts and then only arabic.\
  \ \n\nI entered the line for Bus 19, which would take me directly to Ramallah. My\
  \ first surprise was that the bus there was actually 18. I was doubtful as I had\
  \ confirmed the information many times, so while I was trying to double, triple\
  \ check it, the bus went away. The people there were insistent - it was the right\
  \ bus. After a little wait, a new bus 18 was there. I wasn\u2019t very confident\
  \ because there were some language misunderstandings, but between taking it or leaving\
  \ it...\n\nAs I entered the bus, the driver told me we were going to Qalandia and\
  \ I would have to take a sherut - the shared taxis of Palestine - to Ramallah. I\
  \ was having trouble on understanding until an english man helped and told me both\
  \ places weren\u2019t far and he was going there too. The bus took off and I started\
  \ wondering about where and why exactly was I going where I was going.\n\nIt took\
  \ me some time to win over my introvert nature and actually started asking questions.\
  \ Meanwhile it was cozy seeing all those old men and ladies talking to the driver\
  \ and sharing some jokes which I had no idea what were about, but made me smile\
  \ as well, although it also made me feel as foreign as ever. \n\nMy first discovery\
  \ was that there no direct buses to Ramallah that day - which meant my return was\
  \ undefined. My second discovery was that Qalandia was actually a refugee camp.\
  \ My third discovery was that we would have to cross the checkpoint by foot, just\
  \ like the locals do.\n\nI only realized my fourth discovery on my way back, in\
  \ the insane traffic jam to get in and out of Qalandia. Actually joining the locals\
  \ lines, standing between bars and worrying about my passport, I felt an unpreceded\
  \ vulnerability. Crossing my own perceptions borders is something I always thrive\
  \ when I travel, but somehow it always catches me offguard. I thought because I\
  \ didn\u2019t know how I would get around that I was taking a leap in the unknown.\
  \ I found out that the real unknown was in the lives of the people that didn\u2019\
  t know not how but if they would get back. That opened a new nuance of sensibility\
  \ to everything I would live later on."
