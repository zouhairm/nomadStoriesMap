Text: "Debi looked into my eyes as he spoke. I was painfully aware that I had most\
  \ of her attention while the walking guide delved into the history of Liverpool\
  \ Street Station It was a rare record of Britain\u2019s finest hours, also the last\
  \ shot at redemption for tens of thousands of Jewish parents. Where I stood, was\
  \ where their hopes were carried. \n\nI wiped my sleep from my eyes, swallowed the\
  \ last bits of my cheeseburger before my professor could shoot daggers from her\
  \ eyes. \nWhat was his name again? I zeroed in onto his name tag hanging limply\
  \ off his collar. Bois. Later, he would have my full attention as he began his father\u2019\
  s journey in a deep husky voice. \n\n\u201CThis was where my father first arrived\
  \ \u2013\u201D, he gestured at the statue of memorial just outside the station.\
  \ 15 pairs of eyes swivelled to his introduction. A group of tourists was enthusiastically\
  \ snapping photos with loud, vicious clicking sounds. One of them posed with the\
  \ statue, a young boy possibly 6 or 7 years old, looking wistfully into the distance.\
  \ \n\nHe paused, his green eyes twinkling as we waited in suspense. I was looking\
  \ at a much younger Bois now. Innocence and oblivion were fresh in his face as he\
  \ stumbled off a Kindertransport. Ahead of him were waves after waves of children\
  \ flooding what little walking space there was. \n\nHe did not know this; his parents\
  \ had fought him a second chance at life. \n\nSome of the older children might have\
  \ an inkling of what was going on, and they gripped with terror. It was an unspoken\
  \ topic; their religion had been a gateway to the monstrosity of prosecution back\
  \ home. There was fear. Uncertainty. \n\nFor some of them too young to remember,\
  \ London was a new playground. \n\nAt the other side of the world, Jews were pawns\
  \ in a playing field of massacre. The last of their lives were a grotesque living\
  \ tale of hide and seek. \n\n\u201C\u2013 and where he reunited with my grandparents\u201D\
  . Bois broke into an infectious grin. My classmates mirrored his smile. Debi stood\
  \ with her arms akimbo, pleased that her students were paying attention. He zipped\
  \ his green parka as a pang of cold air slapped his face. When he began his story\
  \ again, he spoke with fervent vigour. \n\n\u201CThey knew my father was safe. So,\
  \ guess what? They went back to Germany and I have never seen them again.\u201D\
  \ \n\nThat took me by surprise. \n\nBois stopped at the next statue and the rest\
  \ of us huddled closer to hear him speak. There was no way to catch up on the years\
  \ lost. Bois\u2019s father was brought up as an Englishman and his parents knew\
  \ nothing of the world he lived in. In my mind, they would embrace. A senseless\
  \ exchange of German and English mingled among them before the elderly couple bid\
  \ a stranger goodbye. I relished in my daydream, glad that I had turned up for the\
  \ tour instead of succumbing to the effects of jet lag. \n\nAs if he could hear\
  \ me, Bois turned around and gave me a funny look.\n\n\u201CGlad I didn\u2019t bore\
  \ you\u201D. My cheeks flushed in response. He boomed with laughter before it was\
  \ abruptly cut off by Debi\u2019s murderous stare. Bois cleared his throat and the\
  \ tour resumed. That was certainly not what he had expected."
