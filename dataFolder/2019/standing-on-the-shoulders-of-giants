Text: "A journey with friends to the middle east to celebrate a milestone Birthday:\
  \ We start by arriving at Tel Aviv and four friends visiting Jerusalem where for\
  \ some of the party, deeply spiritual religious ties are made as they quietly reflect\
  \ on the Wailing wall. Then we spend a few days wandering the street of the holy\
  \ city trying local food, meeting local people and customs. En route to the southern\
  \ city of Eilat requires a short coach journey across the ancient Nagrev desert\
  \ but not before stopping off to visit the ancient city of Bethlehem in the Palestinean,\
  \ west bank. Or most specifically, the church of Nativity where Jesus Christ himself\
  \ was born. That evening ends with the party preparing for the days ahead, resting\
  \ in luxury at the coastal resort in the city of Eilat...\nFirst day in Jordan:\
  \ The next morning the party wakes early to start a two-day coach journey to Jordan.\
  \ The first day is spent exploring one of the seven wonders of the world; the ancient\
  \ Nabataean city of Petra. The clandescent formation of the rocks has naturally\
  \ formed over millennia to reveal a concealed city that is famous as film locations\
  \ for Indiana Jones and Transformers. As evening arrives, we see our party of friends\
  \ spend the night in a Bedouin campsite in the desert, experiencing the local lifestyle\
  \ briefly. Falling asleep amongst the bright twinkling stars of the unspoilt and\
  \ unpolluted clear middle eastern night sky. \nSecond day in Jordan: There is indeed\
  \ a Hollywood motif running through the trip as the next day see us explore the\
  \ region of Wadi Rum, home to even more Hollywood locations as Star Wars and the\
  \ Aliens films. The area is more noticeable regarded for its natural beauty and\
  \ eccentric desert appearance. So much so that it captivated the mind of middle\
  \ eastern explorer and revolutionary DH Lawrence. Enough so to document in his book\
  \ the Seven Pillars of Wisdom. After a day exploring the miraculously protected\
  \ desert wilderness, it is time to head back to Eilat and over the course of the\
  \ next day, slowly edge our way back to Tel Aviv airport. Of course, not forgetting\
  \ to take in some last minute images of the Holy land and maybe even haggle a few\
  \ bargains priced souvenirs in the markets. \nOn the final night, good friends toast\
  \ the experiences they have shared and the unique sights they have seen together.\
  \  \nOne thing is for certain, the trip overall has more revealed more riches than\
  \ anything imagined in both heaven and earth."
