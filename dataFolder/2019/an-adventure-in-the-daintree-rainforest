Text: "Arriving in the forest\n\nSo, I am in the oldest rainforest of the world. How\
  \ many times had I already heard it today? While I was walking under the rain in\
  \ the morning, the first thing I thought was: Living here is not for beginners!\
  \ People who live inside de forest are strong people. That is why aboriginal and\
  \ indigenous keep surviving. \nAt the same time, I couldn't wait to stay alone here\
  \ and to spend time on myself. The forest was calling me in my mind and my body.\
  \ \nI had just arrived in that place when I had to decide to stay or to go back.\
  \ Suddenly, my plans were broken because a storm had been coming. \nSome people\
  \ tried to help me to decide. Better go back to Cairns, save money and avoid preoccupations.\
  \ One more time in contact with the forest to decide: I am here and I need do stay.\
  \ Only by myself. \nI still had one night in ta wonderful room in the middle of\
  \ the forest. My mobile phone stopped to work. I don't know why but I had bought\
  \ a box with something around twenty cookies and five instantaneous noodles. I brought\
  \ all my things with me. I had two books, pastel chalks and warm clothes. The other\
  \ three girls that was with me decided to get out. This room was there only for\
  \ me with hot water and Daintree tea. When I entered in the bathroom I read in the\
  \ wall the name of the most listened song in my Spotify on the last weeks: \"Welcome\
  \ to the Jungle\".\n\nAfter came back to the civilization\n\nNow, I am in the Cairns\
  \ Airport. It was a long journey until here. Yesterday, after the breakfast I organized\
  \ all my things to get out from Daintree Rainforest. I talked with some people to\
  \ ask for a lift. In the hotel nobody helped, just the staff people. It was good\
  \ speak in Portuguese with two girls from Portugal. In the reception a man offered\
  \ to leave me in a caf\xE9 where I could meet someone who was going to Cairns. Almost\
  \ impossible because the ferry was not working under the storm. \nAlthough my terrible\
  \ English and this bad situation I met an amazing couple who were playing cards\
  \ while the water in the road didn't go down. Indigo and Dan were going to Cairns\
  \ and they asked me if I would like to go with them.\nOn the road too much water.\
  \ However, we could see a cassowary (a bird that only exists in this part of Australia)\
  \ with three or four babies and waterfalls in everywhere. In the middle of the way\
  \ a big tree had been fallen. Just a small free place where only a small car could\
  \ pass. Our lucky!\nBut the adventure did not finished yet. We had waited three\
  \ or more hours to go down the water in a bridge before Cairns' road, when we realized\
  \ that it would not happened fast. More one hour in a caf\xE9 spending time with\
  \ the same people that I was talking in the morning. Everybody in the same situation.\n\
  But Indigo had a contact in the city. Someone that she had met earlier. A man that\
  \ had told to her to call him if something bad happened. \nJeff received us in his\
  \ house, gave us a place to sleep and to take a shower. Wine, sweet toasts and coffee.\
  \ He and her wife gave us more: attention and care. Lovely people. \nAfter we woke\
  \ up, had breakfast and said goodbye more two hours on the road. Finally, the rain\
  \ stopped. But its results were still there. Rocks on the way, many roads closed.\
  \ A lot of surprises.\nNow, here I am in the airport safe and comfortable. Thank\
  \ you Indigo and Dan for all of this. I would not stay here without your help. Thank\
  \ you guys for the lift, the patience, the company. \nIn the end of this trip, certain\
  \ I am more strong than I was in the beginning. \nSee you Cairns. Wonderful and\
  \ rainy place. \nHi again Gold Coast. The sun waits for me."
