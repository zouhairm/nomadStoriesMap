Text: "The best selling point for a university, is how big of a melting pot it is.\
  \ I\u2019d met people from all over the globe during my 1st year, but none were\
  \ as casually comfortable come first chat as Francisco (AKA Harry\u2014yes as in\
  \ Potter) was. We grew close throughout the year, and stories of our home lives\
  \ flowed constantly. His Portuguese lifestyle paralleling my Egyptian multiple times\
  \ over. The Iberian Peninsula has visible, external signs of historic Arab conquest,\
  \ from language, to food, to architecture; but sharing a lifestyle means sharing\
  \ the same values. That\u2019s what intrigued me enough to book a trip last April.\n\
  \nUpon arrival, Harry and his mom welcomed me in the familiar comfort of a car ride\
  \ to my hostel near the centre. Along the way, they gave me small cover sentences\
  \ for parks, squares, and other landmarks. Some were historic, some political, mostly\
  \ though they were ones Harry knew odd backstories about. Once I was all settled,\
  \ he showed me around the heart of Lisbon, piling me up with Portuguese staples;\
  \ pastel de natas, ginja, and the oh-so delicious green wine. We hopped on a train\
  \ to a residential quarter that was stubbornly just as beautiful as the crowded\
  \ city centre we\u2019d just left behind. Beneath the cliffs were different kinds\
  \ of crowds; ones enjoying the glory of sun, sand, and sky. Spread out on the beach\
  \ were volleyball players, sunbathers, surfers, and happy, morning drunk people.\
  \ We made our way down a boardwalk where a father was teaching his son to skateboard,\
  \ others walked all sizes and shapes of dogs for both parties\u2019 exercise. Meeting\
  \ up with the rest of the group I\u2019d come to know from university, we joined\
  \ in the unanimous celebration of nature. \n\nNow, don\u2019t think for a second\
  \ that Harry had ever signed on as my personal tour guide. After making sure I\u2019\
  d reached home safe, that was the last I\u2019d see him in Portugal. I was now in\
  \ a foreign country that didn\u2019t daunt me. I knew my way around, but couldn\u2019\
  t stand anything less than a real authentic experience. What I mean to say is: a\
  \ bus tour wasn\u2019t gonna cut it. The next few days were spent as you\u2019d\
  \ expect, gorging myself on the heavenly mecca that is Portuguese food. Seriously\
  \ though, do they sprinkle magic over everything? I still was not satiated, and\
  \ fate threw me a bone. \nWhile walking along the busy central promenade, a street\
  \ performer made for my attention. He was head to toe covered in silver paint, and\
  \ flowing through a rendition of a Beatles song. A smile and a slight nod showed\
  \ his appreciation when I threw some loose change into a hat nestled between his\
  \ feet. I stepped back into the circle of spectators. \n\n\u2018He really looks\
  \ like John Lennon doesn\u2019t he?\u2019 \n\nI was speaking more to myself, but\
  \ a tall man standing next to me responded back. He looked swallowed by the guitar\
  \ on his back and a larger-than-life afro over his easygoing face. He nodded, and\
  \ made a sound when he actually registered what I\u2019d said. That was the start,\
  \ the conversation ran until the inevitable ask for a drink came. This isn\u2019\
  t a love story, or a catalogue of men I\u2019ve met in Portugal, but rather the\
  \ tale of how my intuition built up on all these events. Following sounds sheepish,\
  \ but listening to my inner judgment of the people I was meeting and the places\
  \ they were taking me was a key. It unlocked countless moments of excitement, intrigue,\
  \ foolish/reckless amusement; hostel drinking games and sunsets overlooking waves\
  \ crashing into cliffs. I met people with insane talent, with mountains of discourse,\
  \ and especially, with open hearts. It wasn\u2019t because of me saying yes to a\
  \ drink with a stranger, but that was when the rollercoaster bar came down, and\
  \ the car started clicking up."
