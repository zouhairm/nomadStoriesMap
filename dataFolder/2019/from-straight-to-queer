Text: "A week after arriving and already the experiences I\u2019ve had have been quite\
  \ unexpected, to say the least. My first day commenced with forced small talk at\
  \ 7am in Terminal 1 at Dublin Airport and ended in a strip club called \u2018Cat\
  \ Cabaret\u2019. It was quite a funny experience actually. I remember being quite\
  \ relieved that I didn\u2019t have to dance nor pretend to be interested in pursuing\
  \ false intents to kiss a girl as I was exhausted from a day of travelling. Instead,\
  \ I got to sit down and sip on my beer and enjoy losing my strip club virginity.\
  \ A beautifully tall and audacious lady sat beside me. Each of us had our own \u2018\
  female companion\u2019 (my attempt at using sophisticated English language to avoid\
  \ objectifying). My half-naked lady posed general small-talk questions, such as\
  \ \u201Cwhere are you from, what are you studying, do you like Bratislava\u201D\
  \ etc. I was quite brutally honest by reassuring her that she didn\u2019t have to\
  \ waste her time with me as I am gay. Her shocked state heightened when she demanded\
  \ that I show her a picture of my boyfriend. Unfortunately, I had no picture, stemming\
  \ from not having a boyfriend. She didn\u2019t necessarily believe me. I didn\u2019\
  t blame her, there were four of us together; three Irish lads, all rather intoxicated\
  \ and a recent post-pubescent American chap from Nebraska, who was probably tipsy\
  \ from drinking a beer for the first time, didn\u2019t exactly pose \u2018gay.\u2019\
  \ Instead, one may define us as young and promiscuous Western boys on tour. However,\
  \ my sexuality managed to save my wallet this time. Undue thanks were in order for\
  \ my unfamiliar gene formation.\n\nBut the inception of unearthing Bratislava\u2019\
  s gay scene arrived some months later. Despite a consideration of giving the night\
  \ a miss due a tame fatigue, I had the most queer night ever. I wore eye liner,\
  \ something I\u2019ve never done before \u2013 I loved it. We went to a transgender\
  \ guy from Poland's apartment for some pre-drinks. His friends were remarkably atypical;\
  \ glitter bombed faces, glossy pouts, tight pants; I think I was the only one not\
  \ wearing nail varnish. I poured a vodka and asked for a hand to draw on my eye\
  \ liner.\n\nMy flatmate\u2019s dates friend was cute. I liked him. I sat close to\
  \ him in the taxi to the club. We arrived and it was the busiest I\u2019ve ever\
  \ seen Subclub. This queer themed night only happens once every two months and is\
  \ well-anticipated by the LGBTQ+ community in Bratislava. There were fetish masked\
  \ men eyeing up the new arrivals near the bar, topless men with pristine torsos,\
  \ leather straps and hard techno setting the tone for a licentious night with loose\
  \ morals.\n                                                                    \
  \                          \nI danced and danced; I floated into the rhythmic grinding\
  \ shards. The first guy I spotted whom I liked was cavalier despite holding my hand\
  \ every so often. After a few more tequila shots, I glanced the guy who I remembered\
  \ from the \u2018Red Rain\u201D night \u2013 a Communist themed rave. I was relatively\
  \ content as I felt drawn towards him some two weeks ago, but assumed that his female\
  \ friend was his girlfriend. After a while, we locked eyes and began to dance together.\
  \ His kiss was soft but too short. But I knew that we had considerable time to change\
  \ that.\n\nThe navy abyss with sporadic white lights revealed secrets on the dance\
  \ floor; my flatmate is kissing another man, I\u2019ve never seen them look as happy.\
  \ They rush over to me with such flamboyance and grab my arms with such exclamation:\
  \ \u2018did you see the naked man??\u201D Such a casual image, a literal naked person\
  \ swaying in motion to the beats from the harrowing thunder, electrifying the club.\
  \ We feel shocked; the crowd seems oblivious, blinded by his freedom in this safe\
  \ place.\n\nPeoples longing to soak up the sharpness of the night crystallised.\
  \ I fell into the calligraphic pattern. My soft kissed lover brought me away and\
  \ my uncertainty was blurred in my undulating bubble. Weary but in control, I let\
  \ go and allowed the night to engulf me."
