Text: "I woke up on my last day in Madrid with my heart full. Why did I have to go\
  \ back? How many hours were there until my flight? \n\nQuestions like these coursed\
  \ through my veins, only pulling me further back into the bed that I woke up in.\
  \ I wasn\u2019t hungry, I was sad. I packed my things, not really caring if I woke\
  \ up the sleeping body next to me. \n\nI stared into my rented mirror and decided\
  \ to be excited for the day. The plan was to scour El Rastro Flea Market for last\
  \ minute souvenirs, looking through everything for what I could look at and think\
  \ of this time and this journey I\u2019d taken. \n\nStanding in this flea market,\
  \ an ocean away from everything that I knew, I was reminded of walking around flea\
  \ markets with my Grandpa. He\u2019d give my sister and I ten dollars and told us\
  \ that we could spend it on whatever we wanted. At that time, it felt like we were\
  \ being given the world. I felt the same way in this noisy, bright street. \n\n\
  It took forever, but I walked away with a couple of things, a wallet that was embroidered\
  \ with elephants, a crocheted cactus for my best friend, magnets for my family,\
  \ and earrings and a necklace for me. I walked with the guy I had come here to meet\
  \ in the first place, and we saw towering pictures of graffiti, bright colors covering\
  \ the harsh, boring colors of the buildings. \n\nI went into a shop and found, without\
  \ even looking, earrings that I loved. Pressed flowers against white shapes, and\
  \ even though my companion wanted to leave, I bought them. This wasn\u2019t about\
  \ him, it was about me, intentionally remembering this trip for my own sake, not\
  \ just for the reasons why I came here, and certainly not for him. \n\nWe bought\
  \ the candies and I opened mine to find a little trash-can, which resulted in the\
  \ beautiful Instagram post that followed of me looking sheepishly into the camera,\
  \ holding my plastic can. It was adorable, and made me appreciate the little things.\
  \ I saved that trash can, and so many other things from that trip, just to hold\
  \ on to every little memory. I didn\u2019t ever want to let it go. \n\nThere was\
  \ this neighborhood with the best Indian food ever, and we went there to meet some\
  \ friends of his. It was there, in this beautiful Indian restaurant, that it hit\
  \ me that I was leaving that day. \n\nHe and his friends were talking about an upcoming\
  \ trip, and I remembered that my magical weekend of staying up all night and dancing\
  \ was over, and it was back to the impending reality of school and family and the\
  \ spell that this guy and I had been under would fall apart. I ate my food, savoring\
  \ the flavors, that weirdly reminded me of home, of getting Indian food with my\
  \ best friends, making it special. \n\nAll of this felt bittersweet, especially\
  \ when the waiter came over with mango lassis for everyone, even though my meal\
  \ didn\u2019t actually come with one. I felt included. We paid for our food and\
  \ then it was time to take the Metro to the airport. \n\nHe came with me, even though\
  \ I already knew the way. I think he felt bad, but it was nice to have the company\
  \ either way, each of us taking up two seats to create this artificial space between\
  \ us. \n\nI love public transportation, even when it\u2019s busy. I loved the Metro\
  \ in Madrid, because I felt that it made more sense, even though the seats, the\
  \ people, and the purpose was all the same. I carried my bag all on my own, not\
  \ wanting to ask for help. \n\n\n\nI cried when he left me in the airport, a big,\
  \ bawling, cry. I wiped my tears and checked in. I was on my own again, due in another\
  \ country sooner than I wished. \n\nI watched the city recede in the plane window,\
  \ and I had never felt so much relief. I knew that next time that I would travel\
  \ for me."
