Text: 'You ask people why do they travel? You will be flooded with million different
  answers for they cannot point their finger on a   certain reason why they are doing
  it? When you arrive at a new place there''s nothing around you that reminds you
  of the person that you used to be, things such as the school you went into, the
  shops you visit frequently,the familiar faces passing by, hill by the lake where
  you had your first kiss, your religious identity, your gains ,your losses , responsibilities
  that are wieghing you down, nothing reminds you or bring back any memories of the
  person that you used to be, you are at a new place with a new identity (it''s better
  if you forget your own name) and you get a ache to start new, in fact that''s what
  we all crave for now and then to start again new, may be you question some fundamentals
  of societal identity, but what you''re not understanding is as you travel away from
  your known place to unknown you''re looking at a broader picture of who you were
  and there comes the analysis into one''s own life, problems that seemed like mountain
  might seem like a molehill from a thousand miles,so if someone were to ask me why
  do I travel? I would simply say" I wish to tell you but you wouldn''t understand".
  When the dust settled and clouds rain, when the never ending lines of pine trees
  by the road turned green, I rode about  thousand miles just to see her face, I rode
  against time, I rode against storm, I rode against all the things that wieghed me
  down, days and years to come ahead I will hunt for wisdom in everything I find,
  bunch of adventure and memories to rewind, and all those things to fill in my mind,
  years from now I will sit on this day with a bottle of wine and broad smile, scribbling
  stories of good old time,

  for I will be sure I have lived mine.

  Dear friend find me again when I''m old, on a countryside with oakwood and blue
  pond,we have paths left alone and good old days that are gone, come riding by that
  misty road; will cruise once again against the odd, with some will that never fold.

  So dear friend find me again when we are old, if that soul of you haven''t sold.'
