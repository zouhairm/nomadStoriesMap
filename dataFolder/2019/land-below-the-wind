Text: "\"I guess we'll see just how vegetarian you really are\" he threatened jokingly,\
  \ throwing a 'last resort' can of tuna into the pack. My colleagues and I were preparing\
  \ to spend three days in the Bornean rainforest and we had run out of time to provision.\
  \ I was concerned about the fortitude of my moral underpinnings until a few hours\
  \ later when our guide Sapinus began pointing out an abundance of edible plants\
  \ and fruits that we could forage along the way.\n\nI was quite taken by the lovefruit,\
  \ a delightful tango of pomegranate and passion fruit. But my favourite by far were\
  \ bamboo shoots, gleefully harvested with smooth measured swings of glinting machete.\
  \ Crisp and juicy when fresh, or rich and infused with spices after being stewed\
  \ in a makeshift bamboo receptacle by the fireside at nightfall. This was when stories\
  \ would start flowing, amidst whirring cicadas and dancing fireflies.\_\n\nGenerations\
  \ worth of rich knowledge tumbled from the tongues of locals across the whole island\
  \ of Borneo, the land below the wind. Wisdom of the enormous interconnected ecosystem\
  \ of flora and fauna woven with spiritual undercurrents. These oral histories reverberated\
  \ with whispers from the days of the headhunters.\_\n\nI have never trusted strangers\
  \ so quickly as the Malays of the forest. I was enchanted by the purposeful and\
  \ rhythmic steps which propelled Sapinus up the treacherous, muddy slopes. Never\
  \ seeming to lose his centre of balance, he was my anchor in the dark, wet tangle\
  \ of creeping vines and foreign sounds.\n\nDriving back from our weekend escapades\
  \ was always covered in gloom. Of course, soft spots were formed for the bustling\
  \ capital of Kota Kinabalu, with its wide smiling locals and repetitive mall jingles.\
  \ There was even a mysterious jazz flautist living in our apartment complex; whose\
  \ ephemeral notes would occasionally drift down from somewhere higher in the courtyard.\_\
  \n\nHowever, it always felt as if we were leaving an ethereal world behind and re-entering\
  \ a duller reality. Increasingly, during our work with the environmental organisation,\
  \ we realised that reality was crashing down on each of the communities that we'd\
  \ visited. No matter how tucked they were in gentle valleys, nor nestled on whimsical\
  \ most-northerly beaches. Not even perched in the Kelabit highlands, some 50-minute\
  \ flight away in a light plane, faces pressed against windowpanes, were the peoples\
  \ or the land safe from the onslaught of 'development'.\_\n\nNo longer is Borneo\
  \ the same wild island of dense tropical rainforest, rare endemic species, and mysterious\
  \ nomadic peoples that once struck wonder into the hearts of the most intrepid explorers.\
  \ Now, massive swathes of oil palm plantation, where once lay a web of abundance\
  \ teeming with life. Lacerations of a mechanic straightness, stretching to meet\
  \ the horizon. I felt dually motivated and disheartened.\n\nHaving time to explore\
  \ on the weekend was a great way of re-motivating oneself after hours of pouring\
  \ over legal research, the decidedly un-sexy reality of saving the environment.\
  \ Despite the sorrow, I felt greatly enriched and rejuvenated. I even pried the\
  \ last leech from my ankle tenderly, happy to be considered part of the ecosystem\
  \ despite the anthropocentric views of my species."
