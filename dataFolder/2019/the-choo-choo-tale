Text: "This New Years, I decided to take my parents out for a trip to Puri. It is\
  \ a city in the state of Odisha in eastern India. It is also known as Sri Jagannath\
  \ Dham after the 12th-century Jagganath Temple located in the city. It is one of\
  \ the original Char Dham pilgrimage sites for Hindus.\PAnyway, since I had to fund\
  \ this trip, and we took the cheapest seat coach trains where there was a mix of\
  \ all classes of people. Our train was scheduled for 6am. This was my third time\
  \ in a train... the first time was when I travelled to Rourkella, also a state in\
  \ Odisha. And the second time was for Pune where I pursued my college degree.\P\
  So this was pretty exciting for me. We settled down in crappy seats where we had\
  \ random people getting on and off at different stations. It was pretty cramped\
  \ up with no leg space. I was very pre occupied by the vendors who kept coming in\
  \ and screaming on different decibels to sell either food, books, keys, locks, u\
  \ name it. Then there were beggars of different kinds coming in to sing or just\
  \ simply annoy us. When i say annoy, it means that if you belong to India, seeing\
  \ a beggar would mean your reaction to instantly ignore as their level of scam is\
  \ indigenous. After a few stations, the famous Kharagpur had arrived. This is mainly\
  \ known for the IIT located there. At this stop began the most memorable event of\
  \ my life... The entire 10 hour journey suddenly got way more interesting because\
  \ of this one guy who kept staring at me from the end of my coach.\PThe first time\
  \ I looked at him, he did not catch my attention, but his eyes were so sharp that\
  \ I was bound to look again. He was this kid-looking guy wearing a grey hood, jeans,\
  \ specs and a stubble. He was ofcourse looking tired given that he kept standing\
  \ the entire journey. Wonder why he did not just cut a ticket for himself. But he\
  \ looked very comfortable that way so I assumed he travelled regularly. My dad sat\
  \ opposite to me and my mom beside me. We kept playing the stare game. It was fun\
  \ for me at first and then even I kind of got into the flow of it. Whenever we were\
  \ hindered by a passerby or the Hijras who were by the way obsessed with him as\
  \ they are with all the good looking men in the train, we kept tilting our heads\
  \ to get a better glimpse. It was as if we had something unspoken between us, but\
  \ I could not muster up the courage to go and speak with him neither did the crowd\
  \ allow us to do so. Finally after a lot of stations and almost about 6 hours, he\
  \ got a seat. From there also he tried putting his head up and looking at me. Finally,\
  \ he tried to do the lip talking thing. Which I later realised how bad I am at.\
  \ I could not understand a word he said. Which was pretty frustrating for him I\
  \ guess. He asked me where I was off to, where I stayed in Kolkata and finally he\
  \ asked me if I had my business card with me. So i fumbled and did not know what\
  \ he meant until he flashed his card from across. All of a sudden he disappeared\
  \ and I was restless looking out for him. He later appeared from the washroom all\
  \ freshened up wearing a dotted white shirt. He pointed at the right side washroom\
  \ saying his business card was there. I wondered where in that dirty unhygienic\
  \ indian toilet could he stick in his card. His stop was next and I really wanted\
  \ to know if he actually kept his card there. So at that stop a lot of people got\
  \ down and we exchanged our goodbyes and he smiled oh so cutely. He got off and\
  \ I immediately ran to the washroom he pointed at. To my surprise was his card stuck\
  \ to the mirror. I got that out only to know that this man was a documentary film\
  \ maker, photographer and so much more. A very funky name of the company too. I\
  \ was impressed. I came out hoping the train did not already start. There he was\
  \ standing at the station to confirm if I had received the card. I nodded and he\
  \ happily flipped away.\PWe still had an hour more till our station and I just could\
  \ not stop thinking of what a filmy situation all this was."
