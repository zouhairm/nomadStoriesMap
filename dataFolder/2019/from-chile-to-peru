Text: "It was my first time travelling by myself, everything was going magnificent,\
  \ until the day of going from Chile to Peru came.\nSince I needed to save up some\
  \ money I decided to travel by bus. When I got to the board between those 2 countries,\
  \ I found that there were no buses to Peru, the drivers have organised a protest\
  \ against something important which I do not remember now. I had to go across that\
  \ desert during a hot day by walking, that walking was quite tiring, I dragged two\
  \ suitcases and carried a heavy backpack, (there were no options, I had to get to\
  \ Peru). Fortunately, everything was not completely awful, during the walking, I\
  \ got to know an interesting old lady who lived in Peru, she also helped me carrying\
  \ the smallest suitcase some times (life, perhaps, show you wisely that nice people\
  \ still exist). There was a moment too, in which I could not buy bread because I\
  \ had forgotten to change money, however, the seller woman was really kind and gave\
  \ some bread to me with no pay in return. Those memories bring me back so many beautiful\
  \ moments, that is why I always laugh when telling the story to friends. I will\
  \ not forget that travel, and how could I? If I went through those tremendous embarrassing\
  \ episodes! \nEven though, I would travel on and on as much as possible because\
  \ travelling heals emotional wounds, finds you when you are lost or gets you lost\
  \ when necessary. Travelling is so marvellous that I am afraid I turned already\
  \ into a gipsy who likes wondering, wandering and tasting life."
