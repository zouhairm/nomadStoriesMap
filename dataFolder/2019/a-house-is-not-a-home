Text: "At eighteen, we emerge from high school as almost-adults who are filled with\
  \ wonder and excitement for our future. We are quick to cut the familial ties, and\
  \ are encouraged to move on to bigger and better cities in order to follow our dreams.\
  \ The only thing that could hold us back is fear.\n\nI was that eighteen year old.\
  \ \n\nNewcastle to Melbourne doesn\u2019t sound like a far feat to most, but to\
  \ the girl who lived with a single mum, who had next to no income, in the small\
  \ country-like suburb of Teralba: this was big. \n\nI recall stepping out of my\
  \ first ever plane ride and onto the forty degree summer-scorched tarmac at Tullamarine\
  \ airport, with tear-drenched cheeks, and an unwelcome lump in my throat. Shaking\
  \ all over, I followed the overwhelmingly large crowd of businessmen towards the\
  \ exit. My feeble stature drowned in \u2018cutesy\u2019 overalls and boots, only\
  \ added to my alienation in the suit-donning world I\u2019d just entered.  At this\
  \ point, I had one goal and one goal only: Find the Sky Bus and get the hell out.\
  \ \n\nOnce I made it to Southern Cross station, I was welcomed by a cacophony of\
  \ sound that I had never encountered before. Feeling dizzy and out of my depth,\
  \ I sat outside a soup bar for twenty long, heart palpitation-inducing minutes before\
  \ I met with my mother\u2019s friend Watchalee; one of the very few Thai people\
  \ (or any ethnic people) I had been acquainted with. \n\nNote: This was about to\
  \ change upon my first tram ride, where I was one of two Caucasian people on a tram\
  \ of about fifty. I don\u2019t think I experienced culture shock so much as I was\
  \ genuinely confused. How could one city be so different from another in the same\
  \ English-speaking continent? \n\nI felt like a foreigner in my own country.\n\n\
  That night, I sat in Watchalee\u2019s suburban home, hunched over Thai food and\
  \ chomping through streams of tears. \u201CIt\u2019s just spicy,\u201D I assured\
  \ her. The tears kept coming as I realised I had left my first ever boyfriend, my\
  \ beautiful pink-walled, Michael Jackson decorated room, and my loving mum. \n\n\
  The following week I was to have prepared thoroughly for my first professional creative\
  \ arts course, find a home, a job, and somehow assimilate to a new city.\n\nI decided\
  \ to embark upon the latter. \n\nIn an attempt to find some semblance of comfort,\
  \ I followed my feet into the CBD and then into a Starbucks. I had never been to\
  \ a Starbucks before, but I was familiar with the name, so it felt safe. Soft jazz\
  \ waltzed its way through the ambient chatter of early-morning caf\xE9 goers, and\
  \ I sat with an iced latte for Sian. \n\nWho\u2019s Sian? \n\nI quickly learned\
  \ that Starbucks was the least impressive coffee in Melbourne in comparison to the\
  \ many cafes, which laced themselves throughout the compilation of city laneways.\
  \ As I explored the usual go-to's: Hosier Lane, Degraves, and Hardware Lane, I found\
  \ that I started to understand the grid that Melbourne city was built upon. I walked\
  \ along Southbank Boulevard that night and watched the Gas Brigade\u2019s \u2018\
  Fire Show\u2019 blaze with a force that startled me at first, but had me awe-struck\
  \ long enough to absorb the rest of Southbank\u2019s beauty. Fairy lights intertwined\
  \ their way through tree branches and buskers\u2019 voices soared across the Yarra.\
  \ Sensorial stimulation fuelled my inner adventurer for the first time.\n\nMy energy\
  \ lifted as I strolled across the bridge and into Federation Square, where blue\
  \ and pink lights lit the large congregation of people who sat to watch live performances,\
  \ and eat fairy floss from a nearby vendor. Again, I absorbed the variety of people\
  \ surrounding me and found myself feeling incredibly safe in the multicultural milieu.\
  \ My body tingled as I saw posters for festivals and performances boldly smacked\
  \ across trams and buildings. The Arts Centre was lit up like a Christmas tree,\
  \ looming in my peripheral and reminding me of why I moved to Melbourne. \nTaking\
  \ a moment to breathe in what should have been off-putting city smell, I called\
  \ my mother. \n\u201CI think I\u2019m okay,\u201D I said. \u201CThis feels like\
  \ home.\u201D"
