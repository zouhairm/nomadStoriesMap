Text: "When I was asked to write about a Lebanese hero, my thoughts immediately went\
  \ to Riad el-Solh, a Pan-Arab statesman who, until his death in 1951, fought at\
  \ the forefront of the Arab awakening \u2013 leading to the independence of Lebanon\
  \ from France \u2013 and becoming the first Prime Minister of this new challenging\
  \ era. According to the biography by Patrick Seale, El-Solh had always considered\
  \ himself to be an Arab \u2013 rather than a Lebanese \u2013 having a vision that\
  \ embraced the whole region.\n\nHeroes, indeed, are these kind of people. Through\
  \ their charisma and strength, they adamantly carry on their world vision, with\
  \ the final aim to bring greater good to mankind. Furthermore, these heroes remain\
  \ alive through generations, shaping the culture and the mentality of a nation thanks\
  \ to their actions and moral values. \n\nWhile I was thinking about El-Solh, I had\
  \ not realized that my mind had gone back to 2010, when I was in Damascus. At that\
  \ time, I was working with Iraqi refugees in the countryside, not so far away from\
  \ the Lebanese border. The vicinity of these two countries was for me an occasion\
  \ for traveling back and forth. A way to personally discover \u2013 accentuated\
  \ by the exhausting hours spent at the border\u2019s checkpoints \u2013 that what\
  \ had been built by France, had grown within the mentality of the Syrian and Lebanese\
  \ population: two proud countries, with their own identity. \n\nDuring this period,\
  \ as I traveled from border to border, through the wonderful architectural sites\
  \ that this region offers and the \u201CBaghdad Caf\xE9s\u201D which are seen all\
  \ along the roads, there was always in the background \u2013 soon becoming my traveling\
  \ companion \u2013 the voice of the Lebanese singer, Nouhad Wadi Haddad, better\
  \ known by her artistic name of Fairuz (Turquoise in Arabic). Indeed, inside the\
  \ crowded buses, in the noisy cafes, and within the chaotic public spaces, her voice\
  \ was to be heard, loud and clear. \n\nAs a singer known throughout the entire Arab\
  \ world, Fairuz has been an essential element in creating and strengthening the\
  \ ties between the two quarreling Syrian and Lebanese brothers, but most importantly,\
  \ she leaves behind her a cultural heritage that has surpassed the destruction due\
  \ to the Lebanese civil war (1975-1990), healing the wounds of the fragmented society.\
  \ Born in 1935 into a Syriac Orthodox family, Fairuz has lived through all the most\
  \ important events that have shaped modern Lebanon. Her life and her work have thus\
  \ become intrinsically linked to the story of her country. \n\nListening to her\
  \ songs \u2013 the discography contains some 110 albums \u2013 we have the impression\
  \ of reading one of those Arabic novels in which patriotic, but also personal, accessible\
  \ and everyday themes are expressed. Indeed, the lyrics refer to the problems of\
  \ love, rural life, the landscape with the nightingales, the perfume of jasmine,\
  \ the fig trees, and the vineyards. \n\nWith the eruption of the civil war, in 1975,\
  \ Fairuz has never held any concerts refusing to take sides in the conflict. After\
  \ almost twenty years of silence, during a period of social and political reconstruction,\
  \ she was back in 1994, reemerging through the \u201CPeace Concert\u201D, symbolically\
  \ held on the Green Line \u2013 the demarcation line, which separated the Muslim\
  \ factions in West Beirut from the Christian Lebanese Front in East Beirut. A journalist\
  \ of the time, Jacques Girardon, claimed, \u201CIt could be only Fairuz who was\
  \ able to bring all of Lebanon together [...] She planted herself and stood immobile\
  \ and strong like a cedar, and she sang for the 50-thousand gathered at her feet\
  \ and for the 200-thousand ghosts of the war\u201D.\n\nAs Riad el-Solh very strongly\
  \ believed, confessionalism is the opposite of freedom. Upon this legacy, Fairuz\
  \ built all her life and her vision for her beloved country."
