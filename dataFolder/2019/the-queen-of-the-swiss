  .\n\nThe bus pulls up on the rear-side of Peak Hotel Kierns. From the bus window,\
  \ the building stands tall and yellow. It looks no more than an upscale beach-side\
  \ hotel with its red shutter windows and symmetrical layout. Our bags are pulled\
  \ from the under-compartment of the bus, as we climb down the narrow stairs. Although\
  \ I had not put much thought into the Switzerland-chapter of this European tour,\
  \ the lush green grass that spreads on either side of the hotel promises us of the\
  \ beauty that this country is yet to offer. We search for our own luggage, and drag\
  \ them up the few steps that lead us to the hotel lobby. \nI am 18, and whilst I\
  \ have been so far left in awe of Europe\u2019s cosmetic charm and fascinating history,\
  \ only 4 days into my trip I am wondering if I have made the right choice to travel\
  \ to the other side of the world by myself. I stand in a group of course, but where\
  \ are my friends from home? What are my family doing right now?\nRoom numbers are\
  \ administered, and one-by-one, the group dissipates. There are no elevators in\
  \ this place, so I am glad I packed lightly as I strap my pack tightly against my\
  \ torso and hips, climbing the stairs. Have I made it to the Swiss Alps already?\n\
  I reach my level, waddle to my allocated room, unlock the door, and clumsily push\
  \ my way through, panting. \nAnd there, I see it.\nOn the opposite side of the bedroom,\
  \ the wall is a window, and staring through it, I see what I can only make out to\
  \ be a dream.\nThe pack slips of my shoulders, I let it crash to the floor.\nOutside\
  \ the window, over the balcony onto the landscape below, there is white houses with\
  \ red-tiled roofs the size of Lego blocks on healthy green grass-carpet. The horizon\
  \ offers a feature wall of dark mountains, an immense lake at its feet.\nI think\
  \ I could be dreaming.\nBut I am not.\nI walk -or do I float? - across the wooden\
  \ floor boards, glide the glass door open, and stand on the balcony. A square flag,\
  \ red embedded with a white cross, waves on the flag pole standing just metres in\
  \ front of the balcony. \nI feel now, that I am the Queen of Switzerland, looking\
  \ over my lustrous land. But I am just 18, and I am looking at the most beautiful\
  \ scenery I have ever seen. This Swiss countryside has taken my breath almost completely\
  \ away.\nAnd I think to myself\u2026 \u2018If I lost all the air in my lungs right\
  \ now, I am glad this would be the last thing I ever saw.\u2019"
