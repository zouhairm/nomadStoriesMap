Text: "Haji Mdungi looks and acts like a cocoa-covered smiling Buddha. He grins and\
  \ laughs as we explain that we don\u2019t want a typical Zanzibari vacation: history,\
  \ beaches, spices, monkeys. We want something mysterious, traditional.\n\n\u201C\
  You want voodoo?\u201D he asks?\n\n\u201CYes!\u201D we blurt out in tandem.\n\n\
  Haji, a tour guide based in Stone Town, descends from a line of traditional healing\
  \ practitioners. He grew up with his grandfather, a voodoo practitioner, on Tumbatu\
  \ Island, a deeply traditional island northwest of Zanzibar\u2019s main island and\
  \ where voodoo originates. Visits to the island are restricted, so, our time short,\
  \ Haji arranges for us to meet a practitioner in town.\n\nThe morning is hot as\
  \ we follow Haji through the puzzle of Stone Town. After zig-zagging through town,\
  \ we in flip-flops, Haji in beat up loafers, we stop in front of an iconic carved\
  \ wooden door, this one male, having only one lock. Stepping through into a small\
  \ courtyard, we see dwellings four or five stories high. Sensing the dimensions\
  \ is difficult because it is so full of pots, laundry and other detritus. It seems\
  \ distorted in some way, as if we were in a Stephen King novel: not sure where we\
  \ are or what might happen.\n\nClimbing the narrow, uneven wooden steps to the second\
  \ (or third?) level, an adorable small girl with sable curls smiles shyly as we\
  \ near the apartment. Slipping off our shoes, we enter a dark room. Two women, one\
  \ old and one young, their heads covered and an old man, are watching a soap opera\
  \ on a small black-and-white television. The man is wearing a white kofia, which\
  \ is a typical Zanzibari Islamic hat that is round with a flat top.\n\nAs our eyes\
  \ adapt, our hosts motioned for us to sit on the rugs covering the floor. Looking\
  \ around, the walls seemed to be leaning in, waiting. Haji, wearing his yellow kofia,\
  \ introduces the man, whose name we cannot pronounce. He is a professional, credentialed\
  \ healer and shows us his binder of certification papers. Who knew that voodoo masters\
  \ were credentialed professionals? In Zanzibar, voodoo or spiritual healing, is\
  \ very serious business.\n\nThe old woman quietly joins us on the rug, spreading\
  \ dried herbs and plants on a tray. Covering herself with a large red cloth, she\
  \ begins chanting and drinks in one gulp a small bottle of pale liquid that Haji\
  \ says is rosewater. The young woman behind records the scene on a smartphone.\n\
  \nThe scent of the incense the old woman lights and places in a stone bowl conjures\
  \ images of Arabian Nights. She pulls the bowl close, inside the red cloth, purifying\
  \ herself with the smoke, then shrieks and whirls her body around. As she subsides,\
  \ the man asks about the problems we want to solve. Mine: a solution for poor sleep.\
  \ He looks at me intently as he asks about my family, especially my father. The\
  \ details of which questions and why remain a mystery.\n\nPouring sand over a small\
  \ wooden table, he reads my horoscope by running his fingers through the sand. Then\
  \ he grabs my hand and searches my palm for further clues. His hands are wrinkly\
  \ and very soft like a Shar Pei\u2019s coat. He and Haji confer in low voices for\
  \ a few minutes. Preparing traditional medicines takes care and time, so my remedy\
  \ will be ready the following morning. Not being able to communicate with words,\
  \ I hold the old man\u2019s dark hands and smile. His eyes are soft and full of\
  \ compassion.\n\nThe next morning, as we slop our way through rain-flooded alleys,\
  \ I am curious about my remedy. It comes in a large plastic soda bottle 1/3 full,\
  \ with yellow liquid and floating particles. Haji translates: fill the bottle with\
  \ water then drink a bit and bathe with a bit each day over seven days. \n\nI don\u2019\
  t say that we are leaving in three days or that I am wary about drinking the liquid.\
  \ My lack of sleep is less important than expressing gratitude for the experience\
  \ and for such kind spirits. I have no doubt that had I had the seven days, my sleep\
  \ would be as deep as the sea outside."
