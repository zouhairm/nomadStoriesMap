Text: "\"You're here\", I heard from far away. \"You're here\", I kept hearing. \"\
  You're here\". Only the third time made me realize that I was \"here\", or there,\
  \ all I knew was that I \"was\"; and it was the most beautiful state of being I\
  \ have ever experienced. This was not my typical traveling journey, it was not visa-anger\
  \ with the world system- it was not a plane ticket, endless paperwork, and passing\
  \ friendships in airports. It was years of mental and physical preparations. Doubt,\
  \ adrenaline, and fear. Fear of being sent back before even setting foot in the\
  \ land of controversies, a land so sacred that it never experienced moments of peace.\
  \ Yet, I have never been as peaceful as I was that moment. I have never been in\
  \ perfect alignment with myself; so aware of my surroundings yet so de-attached.\
  \ The air, usually filled with tear-gas, and the sound, usually one of sirens on\
  \ the other side, have never felt so soft on my lungs and so soothing for my ears.\
  \ Travelling does have this effect on me. I could see the olive trees, or so I thought\
  \ I saw a mirage of olives. So certain they were invading my vision that I could\
  \ smell the olives and taste the olive oil, in Palestine. I stood to observe everything\
  \ surrounding me, trying to duplicate the images I had in mind before coming. The\
  \ beauty of traveling is that you start with expectations, but you learn to let\
  \ go along the way. You learn that what you've heard before could be in reality\
  \ the exact opposite. Yet, you end up content and happier. The chances of those\
  \ expectations being met are minimal. Yet, there would be no sense of disappointments;\
  \ whenever you leave, a part of you has changed while everything you had heard remains\
  \ unaltered. \n\nHowever, this was not the case this time. It felt as if I was standing\
  \ here before, trying hard to harmonize what I had imagined with what I was seeing.\
  \ I took my first step; I was counting my steps that day trying to order my brain\
  \ to memorize every move I was making as if I was visualizing and putting together\
  \ my own personal album. I looked at every sign, some in Hebrew, some in Arabic,\
  \ some in both, wandering about the possibilities of coexistence between the two\
  \ signs in real life. That thought was interrupted when I saw one completely destroyed\
  \ and violated. I smiled, regretfully, because some signs are just more powerful\
  \ than the others. Many talk about the magic of traveling; it exposes you to different\
  \ people, cultures, and food. It puts you in touch with their realities, a reality\
  \ you would have never envisioned if you did not make that decision to travel; an\
  \ undiscovered reality that would have seemed, and felt, parallel to ours. Not so\
  \ many talk about the magic of seeing, and feeling, the realities of something as\
  \ simple as the different choice of roof colors, something as simple as the roads\
  \ you car is permitted to explore, or something as simple as a street sign. Those,\
  \ too, have a story worth diving into. \n\n\u201CRamallah, Ramallah, Ramallah\u201D\
  , I heard from away. I almost danced \u201CDabkee\u201D-the Palestinian dance- because\
  \ that\u2019s what I associate the word \u201CRamallah\u201D with; that song that\
  \ gets every Levantinian. Never in my life have I thought that \u201CRamallah\u201D\
  \ could become a reality for me. Never have I associated it with the idea of an\
  \ actual destination. My friend grabbed my arm and dragged me to that voice. \u201C\
  Stop daydreaming\u201D, he said, \u201Cyou truly are here and we truly are late\u201D\
  . We got to the car. I took out my pen and my journal and started taking notes on\
  \ the signs with the untold stories. One of the signs indicated our inaccessibility\
  \ to a road. Another one allowed us in, but only after questioning.  Only then I\
  \ realized that some of my stories will remain untold. Now I am completely aware\
  \ of that. Awareness is resistance and that\u2019s why I travel. It is a form of\
  \ resistance in itself; sometimes you\u2019re resisting stereotypes, others you\u2019\
  re resisting barrier signs."
