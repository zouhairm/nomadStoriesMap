Text: "As I stepped into my new office, the baby blue walls immediately bring the\
  \ sounds of the rushing River Inn to my mind. I could almost taste the sweet river\
  \ mist and feel the warmth of June caress my cheeks. The fond memory formed a smile\
  \ across my face but soon faded as I made myself aware of my current surrounding,\
  \ a small office hidden in the basement of a historic hotel.\n\nMy hands resumed\
  \ the opening of drawers and the rifting through files to prepare new information\
  \ to learn about my role. A little pinch on my heartstrings reminded me of the \u201C\
  adult\u201D decision I confidently made for my future self. After a summer abroad\
  \ in Austria, I decided to place my traveling plans on hold to begin my corporate\
  \ career.\n\nA sigh for wanderlust escaped my mouth, as I toss some pens in a special\
  \ mug etched with descriptions of the Nordkette. It was a gift from Carina, my pen\
  \ pal from Innsbruck. We were selected as buddies as part of the cultural exchange\
  \ program. It\u2019s been almost five years since we\u2019ve first met under the\
  \ Goldenes Dachl to begin our lifelong friendship. I taught her of New Orleanians\
  \ and my Vietnamese heritage and she guided me through Innsbruck valley, the city\
  \ that left an indelible mark on my heart. I recall our daily meals at The Mensa,\
  \ the Innsbruck University cafeteria and while enjoying our meals, we would awe\
  \ at how the mist settled upon the Alps and the manner it descended into the valley\
  \ through out the day. At night, we watched the glimmering lights of  homes nestled\
  \ upon the hilltop while strolling to gelato shops and giggling about what activities\
  \ to pursue before the summer ends. She whisked me to little corners of Hallstatt\
  \ and Vienna, she introduced her family and her cottage style kitchen to my friends\
  \ and I. Her mornings consisted of freshly brewed coffee from a Moka pot and a full\
  \ spread of ham and cheese and homemade currant jam. I can hear her soft, and careful\
  \ speech of the English language asking about my life, always curious about what\
  \ happens on the other side of the world. To this day, we remain in contact through\
  \ written letters scattered with words of \u201CI miss you\u201D and \u201CI\u2019\
  ll visit soon,\u201D in hopes that one of us make a trip some day.\n\n***\n\nAs\
  \ I step into my office, I hear a little knock on my door; I am gifted a rectangular\
  \ box embossed with my company\u2019s name. I just made five years with the world\u2019\
  s most favorite traveling company. I faintly smile as I put it away and resume my\
  \ task at hand. My baby blue walls pinch my heartstrings and reminds me of the decision\
  \ I make for my future self. I begin to write \u201CI\u2019ll see you soon\u201D\
  \ and \u201Cfreedom\u201D and \u201Cconfidence\u201D in a letter to Carina and a\
  \ smile forms and remains as I seal the letter knowing that my plans are no longer\
  \ on hold, but patiently unfolding as I prepare to reveal my untold adventures."
