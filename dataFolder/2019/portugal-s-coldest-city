Text: "As someone who grew up in Southern Ontario, I\u2019ve become accustomed to\
  \ a certain temperature during winter. You can image how shocking it was when I\
  \ moved to Portugal for one year and found myself wearing t-shirts and shorts in\
  \ mid-January.  \n\n Arguably, the locals seemed to think my t-shirt and capris\
  \ look was pretty crazy, but I grew up in -30 temperatures and I wasn\u2019t about\
  \ to wear a winter coat in only 12 degrees.\n\n The other students in my classes\
  \ weren\u2019t much different \u2013 pointing out the absence of a jacket, looking\
  \ in horror as a donned gladiator sandals in December and taking offence to my bare\
  \ shoulders when I came to class wearing an off-the-shoulder top. \n\n It got to\
  \ a point where I started wearing jackets to avoid stares \u2013 until an opportunity\
  \ arose that required a winter coat and mitts.\n\n The Erasmus association at my\
  \ university offered a trip to Serra da Estrela, a city in the northern part of\
  \ Portugal, and one of the few ones known for having snow. We\u2019d go hiking for\
  \ six hours, visit the highest peak in Portugal and get to see the mountain dogs\
  \ known only to the region. \n\n I was thrilled!\n\n I hadn\u2019t seen snow in\
  \ months and I was beginning to worry that I was losing my Canadian edge when it\
  \ comes to the cold.\n\n I even managed to convince a friend from Norway to go,\
  \ and so, at 8 am we met at the Pra\xE7a de Republica, ready to hop on a bus and\
  \ begin our journey.\n\n We arrived at the Logoa Comprida around 10, and rushed\
  \ off the bus as all 60 students desperately ran to the single coffee shop in the\
  \ area to buy espresso. Once we had our fix of caffeine and regional sweets we made\
  \ our way to the Cov\xE3o dos Conchos\n\n It was artificially created back in 2955,\
  \ and now serves to collect water from Ribeira das Naves and funnels it into Lagoa\
  \ Comprida. Its purpose is to provide water to nearby communities but due to the\
  \ plants growing around the edges it gives the illusion of a waterfall within a\
  \ lake.\n\n To hike took us roughly two and half hours; taking into account the\
  \ time spent chatting with new students and taking photos of the landscape and ourselves.\n\
  \n As we made our way to the lake, we noticed a group of students trying to walk\
  \ on the frozen damn. The weather may have predicted negative five degrees on the\
  \ peak of the mountain, but at the Logoa Comprida we were well above zero.\n\n The\
  \ ground was dusted with snow, but it was clearly melting and some trails were already\
  \ beginning to go from packed dirt to slippery mud. And while the muddy terrain\
  \ wasn't ideal we couldn't help gasping with delight every time we saw the mountain\
  \ tops covered in snow, excitedly shouting about how much it reminded us of our\
  \ home countries. \n\n As the only northerners of the group, and the only two with\
  \ experience in the field of frozen lakes and how to walk across them, we warned\
  \ the students not to walk on the ice. \n\n \u201CIt\u2019s fine!\u201D They called\
  \ back in Portuguese, slipping and almost falling as they made their way farther\
  \ onto the lake.\n\n We tried responding in our broken Portuguese that it wasn\u2019\
  t safe while the weather was warm but they brushed it off, calling us dramatic and\
  \ continued to take pictures.\n\n As the first to make it to the Cov\xE3o dos Conchos,\
  \ we sat down, chatted about our programs and enjoyed lunch. \n\n Other students\
  \ slowly started arriving, admiring the natural beauty of the area between complaints\
  \ of feeling cold and having wet shoes. Some joked about slipping and falling on\
  \ the ice, and others passed around their phones with photos of people who fell\
  \ in awkward positions.\n\n  We cringed at the site of them standing on such thin\
  \ ice \u2013 but most of the other students were cringing at us and the fact that\
  \ we decided it was too warm to wear our winter coats."
