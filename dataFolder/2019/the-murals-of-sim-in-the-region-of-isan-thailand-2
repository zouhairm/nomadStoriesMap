Text: "The murals of Sim Isan are in one of the most significant buildings for Buddhists\
  \ in Northeast Thailand. The structures of the Sim Isan, Ordination Hall, or Ubosot,\
  \ are small in comparison with other temples. In addition to religious ceremonies,\
  \ it is used for the ordination of novice monks. The small size reflects the buildings\u2019\
  \ intended use by those directly involved with ordinations. Due to the size restrictions,\
  \ the murals are most frequently painted on the exterior walls. Sim Isan is based\
  \ on the principle of simplicity-sincerity-modesty, which expresses a simple life\
  \ style. The murals are understood to be didactic in nature, and would have functioned\
  \ as tools for teaching those sitting outside. Most people in the area were and\
  \ continue to be Buddhists. Their beliefs and traditions are associated with religion\
  \ and are visible in the community lifestyle. The village lifestyle and principles\
  \ of Buddhism are depicted in the Buddhist murals on the wall of the ordination\
  \ hall. These principles are firmly embedded in the lives of the people in the region.\
  \ Plato\u2019s theory of representations also elaborates on this by taking the perceptions\
  \ that are the analysis of Plato\u2019s theory of forms and explains how these can\
  \ account for two distinct worlds or dimensions of being. The world of physical\
  \ objects in space and time is known through sense perception as ordinary thought.\
  \ Plato\u2019s analysis of representations accounts for two distinct worlds or dimension\
  \ of being: the concreteness and abstraction. This paper presents an analysis of\
  \ Thai concept of form inspired by the mural through a comparison of Plato\u2019\
  s analysis and the Parinirvana approach.\n\nMurals on temple walls often depict\
  \ the supernatural or linkages between the small human and the big universe. The\
  \ linkages could be construed as being somewhere between concrete and abstract,\
  \ imagination and truth. The murals can also be viewed in terms of Plato\u2019s\
  \ world of Form, in which the material world is not the real world, but only an\
  \ image or copy of the real and complete world. Humans can perceive the world of\
  \ Form through to use of reason in order to approach the greatest Form of Goodness;\
  \ this form acts as a beacon guiding humans to perceive the world of the ideal.\
  \ Thus, belief is merely imagination, an abstract and non-existent thing, and as\
  \ such it cannot make us happy. According to the Buddha, in order to be free from\
  \ sorrow and find true happiness after the death, we need to make merit which let\
  \ go of our attachment to our beliefs; we must consider our merit when accepting\
  \ it.\n\nSim Isan mural painting demonstrates the brilliance of local artists who\
  \ were influenced by craftsmen from both Vietnam and Thailand. Moreover, the Sim\
  \ Isan murals express the history of Isan, Thailand. The form, structure, materials,\
  \ decoration, and beliefs attached to the murals make them a worthy subject of study.\
  \ Isan architecture is unique due to the geography of the area. The art and culture\
  \ of each community is directly reflected in the architecture, with the environmental\
  \ influences on local architecture stemming from: 1) climate; 2) beliefs; 3) ethnicity\
  \ and culture; 4) local materials; and 5) the local economy. Plato\u2019s analysis\
  \ of Form can be applied to an examination of religious beliefs in Thailand through\
  \ a comparison of the perception of concreteness and abstraction in the murals of\
  \ Sim Isan. The imagination-based creative process renders beauty in the mural paintings\
  \ of Sim Isan, which is comparable to that of the Platonic Idealism; however, their\
  \ meanings are not always similar. Ultimately, this led to the development of thousands\
  \ of Thai architectural and artistic styles, including those of the morals of Sim\
  \ Isan. This perception encourages people in society to open their minds and listen\
  \ to the Lord Buddha\u2019s teachings."
