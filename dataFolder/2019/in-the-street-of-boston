Text: "In the night of July 30, 2018, I flew away from my beloved ones in Abidjan\
  \ for an unknown destination that appeared to the magnificent city of Boston in\
  \ the United States of America. In my blood, the dreadful heat of the African savannah\
  \ and in my eyes the love for this multiracial America that was staring at me. \n\
  I landed in Massachusetts the next day. This adventure was unimaginable to me who\
  \ had never been out of my country.\nWonders and marvels were everywhere beginning\
  \ with the people that I met. A multi-diverse population with so many different\
  \ backgrounds (race, culture, languages, origins...) \n\nI was simply amazed, I\
  \ could see myself as a stranger in the midst of all this crowd. Boston City, Massachusetts,\
  \ the spirit of the nation. \nA city where multi-diversity has all its meaning.\
  \ It took me many days to adjust because I was feeling so confused about everything.\n\
  The Transportation system in Boston is incredibly elaborated in a way that makes\
  \ it easy to find your way back. \nI experienced the underground railroad system\
  \ for the first time as well as the train itself.\nMany firsts have gone by with\
  \ this trip in the spirit of America.\nIn the streets of Boston, I came across with\
  \ the true meaning of love,\nI saw many couples walking hands in hands and I could\
  \ see more than love in their eyes: there was a vivid flame.\nHere, you can a worldwide\
  \ cuisine with delicious meals, from Africa to Asia, from Europe to the Caribbeans,\
  \ American cuisine... nobody is left behind.\nI ate my firsts Chinese, Indian, Vietnamese\
  \ and Japanese foods in Boston.\n\nOn Boston Harbor, the view is unbelievable. I\
  \ toured in Boston with the famous Duck Tours and I was left speechless by the immensity\
  \ of the historical heritage of Boston City.\nIn downtown, skyscrapers and historical\
  \ buildings will cut your breath. From the State House, the common to the granary\
  \ cemetery, the freedom trail will lead you through the making of this great city.\n\
  One of the places to visit here is the Bunker Hill monument that affirms the greatest\
  \ of the nation in all its dimensions.\nNo matter where you go to Boston, you'll\
  \ find a place to rest your soul in rhythms of America's multi-diversity!\n\nI did\
  \ not know that I would find so much peace so far away from home.\nAnd I will always\
  \ remember the smiles, the joy, and all the good things I received from Bostonians!\n\
  What a great city!\nWhat a great population!\nI will always remember you..."
