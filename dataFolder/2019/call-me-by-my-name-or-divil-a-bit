Text: "*(Ancient Irish Saying: divil a bit = not at all)\n \nLijiang in winter was\
  \ crisp but far from bitter. The air was free from the sulphurous, offensive undertone\
  \ I\u2019d grown accustomed to in Shanghai. Here, I could breathe. \n \nAfter half\
  \ a day of planes and temperamental buses, I arrived in the southern Chinese town\
  \ with a ferocious hunger. Fortunately, the living room of the family that was hosting\
  \ me for the next week also happened to double as a restaurant.\n \nRooted at the\
  \ table in the corner was the woman I\u2019d come to know as Nainai, a relic of\
  \ a more turbulent, radical regime who had stubbornly refused to die out with it.\
  \ She grinned at me. Toothless and bemused. I was as much a strange creature to\
  \ this woman as she was to me. To her right, a cheap grade Chinese heater, to her\
  \ left, a smattering of fish bones and peanut shells she\u2019d spat out and left\
  \ on the floor like a proud kill. \n \nMy host mother instructed me to sit opposite\
  \ Nainai while she went to fetch food. Taking advantage of the opportunity to practice\
  \ Chinese, I introduced myself to Nainai.\n \nA name is a funny thing when you think\
  \ about it. Your own one is assigned to you at birth and you have no say in the\
  \ matter, but it grows on you and before you know it, you\u2019re already too attached\
  \ to let it go. Chinese naming culture is different to ours in the West. For them,\
  \ it\u2019s all about what your name means, not how it sounds. So naturally, when\
  \ you learn Chinese, you\u2019re given a Chinese name. Mine is \u674E\u5723\u8D24\
  \ (plum tree, wise and noble sage) which never ceases to amuse most natives when\
  \ I tell them. Nainai looked unimpressed. \u201CY\xE1ng gu\u012Dzi, hello.\u201D\
  \n \nI was lost for words. Foreign devil, that\u2019s what she\u2019d called me.\
  \ It\u2019s an outmoded Chinese slur for foreigners coined during the Boxer Rebellion\
  \ in the late 19th century.\nAn unease settled over us not helped by Nainai\u2019\
  s unbroken glare. I returned it with a smile, studying her. Warts formed peaks and\
  \ whiskers wound into wispy white streams around her meaty, time-ravaged body. At\
  \ 4ft nothing, Nainai was far from imposing. But even so, she commanded a presence.\
  \ Age is revered in China. The older you are, the more respect you are awarded.\n\
  \ \nAs a sort of peace offering, I gave her a little pin of the Irish flag. I\u2019\
  d brought a bag of them with me on my travels. Nainai inspected the pin and belched.\
  \ \u201CForeign devil, you want some tea?\u201D \n \nFor the few out there who don\u2019\
  t already know, those three words are the key to any Irish person\u2019s heart.\
  \ We tried some light conversation but a language barrier kept us from talking about\
  \ anything of real substance. When that well ran dry, Nainai set her mind on teaching\
  \ me how to play Mahjong. \n \nWhat I remember most from that evening was Nainai\u2019\
  s insistence on referring to me as \u2018foreign devil\u2019 no matter how many\
  \ times I reminded her of my Chinese name. It annoyed me immensely. How was I, a\
  \ person she had never met before, a devil, when I\u2019d been nothing but kind\
  \ to her? The answer eluded me. \n \nThe rest of my time in Lijiang I hardly spoke\
  \ two words to Nainai. I\u2019d smile at her in passing but there were a million\
  \ things I\u2019d planned to see here and none of them involved an elderly Chinese\
  \ grandmother. \n \nOn my last night with the host family, they had a little goodbye\
  \ dinner for me. Nothing extravagant, but still, I was touched. At one point, an\
  \ elderly couple came into the restaurant and Nainai beckoned them over. They chatted\
  \ in an unintelligible dialect for a spell, then Nainai laid her hand on my shoulder.\
  \ \u201CHave you met my foreign devil friend?\u201D\n \nIt was in that moment that\
  \ I realised her use of the word devil sounded oddly warm and endearing to me. It\
  \ reminded me of my own culture where in Ireland the word devil, pronounced as \u2018\
  divil,\u2019 dons so much of our literary canon. \n \nSo in the end, did it bother\
  \ me? \u4E00 \u201Cdivil a bit!\u201D"
