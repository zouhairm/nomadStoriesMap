Text: "Growing up in Accra, Ghana in the late '80s, was a great period for me. Little\
  \ did I know how important travelling to other parts of the country was. In my History\
  \ class in Senior High School in Ghana, we were taught of the Trans Atlantic Slave\
  \ Trade and the effect it has on my country, Ghana. \nAfter my First Degree education\
  \ at the University of Ghana in 2007, I taught it wise to travel across Ghana to\
  \ see for myself the effect of the slave trade. Haven done media work (in the area\
  \ of radio) whiles at the University, I knew the journey to the Slave Trade areas\
  \ were going to be tough to get the details from the locals because most of the\
  \ locals do not want to speak to anyone in the media. In June 2008, two days to\
  \ my Birthday, I took my recorder, microphones and other media pieces of equipment\
  \ and started with my Journey to acquire knowledge. I was really excited to embark\
  \ on this Journey. In my City, you could rent a car for a Day or two.  My first\
  \ stop was the slave castles in a city called Cape Coast. Cape Coast is a coastal\
  \ town of Ghana. Before I arrived at the Slave castles, I had to go through some\
  \ small towns where most of the slave trade took place. Although the slave trade\
  \ took place over 400 years ago, I didn't expect to find a lack of development in\
  \ those small towns. As a media person, I was looking for more information about\
  \ the slave trade to help me in informing listeners of my radio show. My first tour\
  \ at the slave castle came with a mixed feeling. I was excited to gain more knowledge\
  \ but was also emotional whiles I was being walked through some of the slave dungeons.\
  \ As a media person, my focus was to gain more knowledge, so I can share the information\
  \ with the world. After my slave castle tour, I decided to have some interviews\
  \ with the locals. It was not easy getting them to talk. but managed to talk with\
  \ a few of the locals. I could feel how the British language had influenced the\
  \ language of the locals. Trying some of their food and cultural practices also\
  \ could feel the influence of the British. Spending a Day at the Slave castle and\
  \ the local towns, made me yearn for more knowledge. I came back to my city, well\
  \ informed."
