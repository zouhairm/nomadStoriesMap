Text: "I am sitting with my legs crossed, eyes closed. I open them and bask towards\
  \ the sunset behind an Egyptian temple. Being from Egypt, it was a home away from\
  \ home. Some familiarity in an unknown place. It was my last day in Madrid, I still\
  \ don't really understand why I booked a spontaneous trip here. With the brisk,\
  \ fresh air whisking through my face, I was slowly finding my answer. I had set\
  \ to travel to Madrid a few days before while focusing on some future job interviews\
  \ and my almost done bachelor dissertation, there was so much unknown. Where would\
  \ I be in the next few months? Where or who do I want to be? My thoughts and fears\
  \ almost felt like pelting hot and heavy rocks, pushing me down more and more every\
  \ second with more intensity. With every extra worry, another rock would appear,\
  \ adding to my overwhelmed feeling and my inability to focus or breathe properly.\
  \ The feeling was so intense and so immensely consuming, I found myself forgetting\
  \ who I was or what brought me joy. The world had slowly but also ever so suddenly\
  \ turned grey and bland.\n\nWith that, I took a leap. I booked my flights and hotel,\
  \ not completely registering what I had done. And off I went, to a country I didn't\
  \ know about and a language I didn't speak. Completely alone into the unknown. Though\
  \ this scared me, the minute I stopped outside the apartment door towards the airport,\
  \ I felt peace. The rocks just calmly and slowly slipped away. On the flight, I\
  \ laughed with my neighbor. Upon landing, I was exploring the city along my path\
  \ towards my hotel, basking at the beautiful architecture, the people, the sounds\
  \ so different from home. The color was coming back. I found myself remembering\
  \ my joys once more and what I've dreamed of doing for years but forgotten from\
  \ responsibility. With this came lack of fear and a spontaneous need to try new\
  \ things. With my limited Spanish, I explored local markets and tried the merchant's\
  \ recommendations. I dwelled in side roads and quiet neighborhoods. I escaped my\
  \ own reality into another. The bright yellows, the greens, the blues, they were\
  \ all back. \n\nWhile sitting in the silence of the Egyptian temple, I found familiarity\
  \ and signs of a part of home, away from home. After taking a leap into the unknown,\
  \ I found peace. A chance to start again, to forget about the future and its unknown,\
  \ to bask in the beauty of a new place without expectations or other's points of\
  \ views. This experience, this city, it is my own. Although I took this leap, thinking\
  \ it was into the unknown, I was mistaken. I had taken a leap into another piece\
  \ of me. One that I found here and would be taking back with me."
