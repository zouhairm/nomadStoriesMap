Text: "Let's face it. Most of us would rather choose to be with our friends outside\
  \ than to bond with our own blood \u2014 our cousins, for instance. We may have\
  \ different opinions on this, but I am an Asian. We value family ties so much. \n\
  \nI didn't say that a big circle of friends is not advisable. In fact, I really\
  \ have a huge number of friends from all walks of life \u2014 school, church, work,\
  \ random mountain buddies, name it. It's just that as I mature, I realized that\
  \ blood is thicker than water. \n\nAs horrible as it may sound, in the previous\
  \ years we only had family reunions whenever someone from the clan died. I know\
  \ it's so heartbreaking to hear. Times have changed now. We have to break this cycle.\
  \ We learned through the years that meet-ups don't have to be about mourning in\
  \ tears, it could also be laughing along the trails of the mountain while it rains!\
  \ \n\nI'm glad that 17 of my cousins went on this crazy adventure with me. Most\
  \ of them don't have any experience in hiking at all. But who cares? We didn't rush\
  \ to reach the top because that is not mountaineering is all about. It's about the\
  \ love for nature and the camaraderie with your fellow hikers. \n\nTo our surprise\
  \ though, one of my cousins even brought with him his 9-year old son who was twice\
  \ as strong as we are! For the transportation, we opted to rent a private van for\
  \ safety and comfort since we have kids with us and we were to travel the road by\
  \ 11 pm. We didn't stay overnight on the mountain because all of us have prior commitments\
  \ the following day. \n\nBelow I listed five reasons why I found hiking with my\
  \ cousins a new discovery not just of myself, but of those who cared for me that\
  \ I was so blind to see. \n\n1. YOU WILL HAVE AN EXPERIENCE OF DRINKING YOUR COFFEE\
  \ IN THE MIDDLE OF A VAST MOUNTAIN \nTalking not about business, or studies, or\
  \ future plans \u2014 but about a thing that really doesn't make sense, yet you\
  \ all get cracked up to laugh like there's no tomorrow. Coffee in the mountains?\
  \ The best Starbucks ever. \n\n2. AFTER 18 YEARS, YOU WILL MEET YOUR COUSIN WHO\
  \ YOU THINK IS CLUMSY BUT NOW HAS A GIRLFRIEND AND YOU ARE STILL SINGLE (AND WHO\
  \ CARES?) \nWay back in our kindergarten days, we both go to school every morning,\
  \ do our assignments, bully each other, and tally a record of whoever gets most\
  \ of the wins. Turned out in the aspect of love life, I would be the one to be left\
  \ behind! \n\n3. THIS IS THE SWEET REVENGE TIME! YOU'LL TAKE OFF YOUR SHIRT BEFORE\
  \ PLUNGING INTO THE MOUNTAIN WATERFALLS AND TELL EVERYONE, \"HEY GUYS, I GOT A CHEST\
  \ AND A 6-PACK NOW!\" \nWhen you were on your elementary days, your cousins were\
  \ teasing you for being so thin and lame. Sometimes they might call you names you\
  \ really hate. So instead of doing the same to them, you'll just hit the gym and\
  \ eat the right diet, and wait for this opportunity to tell them \"so, who looks\
  \ weak now?\u201D\n\n4. YOU'LL BE SINGING A BIRTHDAY SONG TO ONE OF YOUR COUSIN'S\
  \ DAUGHTER BECAUSE SHE WANTS TO CELEBRATE HER SPECIAL DAY IN THE MOUNTAIN \nSocial\
  \ media has shown us a lot of important events a mountain has witnessed so far such\
  \ as wedding proposals and photoshoots. So why not try to celebrate your birthday\
  \ here for a change? But make sure not to leave any trash on the mountain! Remember\
  \ the golden rule in mountain climbing? \"Leave nothing but footprints, and take\
  \ nothing but photographs!\" \n\n5. YOU WILL APPRECIATE THE BEAUTY OF A SIMPLE LIFE\
  \ AND LEARN TO COUNT YOUR BLESSINGS MORE THAN YOUR FAILURES \nThe lone nipa house\
  \ situated in the middle of the rice field along the trails stood out because of\
  \ its tranquility. I think the family living here is more privileged than most of\
  \ us who live and thrive in the city \u2014 breathing in all the noise and air pollution\
  \ everywhere."
