Text: "The pearl of Africa, washed by the sources of the Nile and the wide Lake Victoria,\
  \ Uganda stands out for its incalculable heritage. \nImmediatly at my first step\
  \ out of the plane I found out that this country was genuine when we weren't really\
  \ sure who was picking us up at the airport, we saw a little man approaching to\
  \ us called Sali Livingstone aimed at bring us to his home, so hesitating a bit\
  \ we said Yes.\nAfter 6 hours of driving from Enttebe to Kasasa district through\
  \ no roads and absolutley no trafic system we reached were we supposed to pass the\
  \ following 2 weeks. It was a village called Kyotera, and during two weeks my friend\
  \ and I we worked as volunters helping out comunities with food, medicines and any\
  \ kind of resources as well as restoreing a kindagarden. \nOne of the most shocking\
  \ parts were to see how thankful they were in spite the fact they had absolutley\
  \ nothing. \nThis scenareo and being part of their comunity, listening their stories\
  \ and their specially their hope, slowly slowly were modifying our behavior. \n\
  The second part of the trip, I have to recognize that we were vey very lucky. Fortunately,\
  \ once having lunch we began to talk with Sali about our plans to do in Uganda.\
  \ Suddenly he told us that he wished a change for him and his family (he is a very\
  \ smart guy)and become a toursit guide, so knowing we were interested to visit some\
  \ national parks and that he had not the resources to move through the country,\
  \ he offered us to collect and bring us to the parks in exchange of help at developing\
  \ his project. We accepted and everything went favolous, we visited many National\
  \ Parks as Queen Elisabeth, the Rhino Sanctuary..., we saw Elephants, Lions, Hippos,\
  \ Crocs, Bufalos... everything that was desired, we climbed up to 3.100m until camp\
  \ 1 of Mount Stanley in Rwenzori National Park, we crossed from West to East and\
  \ visited the Nile and swam in the Lake Victoria, definetley something we will never\
  \ forget. \nAlthough not everything was as good as we were inside a documentary.\
  \ The reality is that we learnt about many troubles faced like, a flat tyre and\
  \ the peoblem to find a replacement in the middle of nowhere, argueing due to the\
  \ extreme fatigue and the no appropiate meals, ( l lost 6kg) the showers improvised\
  \ with plastic cans or sleeping at \"hotels\" with bat nests...\nDespite this, if\
  \ you're able to beat this facts and you put on scale all things lived, with no\
  \ doubt this its and will be probably the best trip I have ever done. \nHope you\
  \ like my story, I'm glad to say that we still helping there out, and we are close\
  \ to publish a website to help Sali gather tourists and finaly reach his Goal being\
  \ a magnific guide."
