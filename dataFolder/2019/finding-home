Text: "We weren\u2019t expecting to find much in the middle of the tiny island of\
  \ Koh Lipe. The lush beaches were filled with trendy, boutique hotels and colorful\
  \ tiki bars, but nobody seemed to pay attention to the interior of the isle. As\
  \ the daylight began to fade, my husband, Chris, and I relied on the pink and purple-hued\
  \ rays to guide our path to the center of the jungle. Swatting away yet another\
  \ mosquito, we finally came upon what appeared to be an abandoned bar. \n\nWhile\
  \ one may have thought it was completely empty, we could smell a faint, intoxicating\
  \ waft of incense and see the delicate waves of smoke curl off of the end of a mosquito\
  \ coil. We decided to chance it and walk up the steps to a bar filled with green,\
  \ yellow, and red signs that read \u201CHome Bar\u201D in the most Bob Marley way.\
  \ \n\nAs we entered, we noticed the rooftop of trees growing over this open-air\
  \ bar. There was a toilet filled with cement acting as a chair, small plants growing\
  \ from old tree roots breaking through the concrete floor, and a slight man with\
  \ a cigarette in his mouth. His tanned, leathery skin and wrinkles around the corners\
  \ of his eyes indicated that, while he was only a middle-aged man, he had lived\
  \ at least a thousand lives. He sat on a bench made from a weathered mattress tied\
  \ over a log while he lightly patted his cat\u2019s head. \n\n\u201CIs this bar\
  \ open?\u201D Chris asked with uncertainty, to which the man replied with a jaunty,\
  \ toothy grin, \u201CWell, I took the last four months off, but I guess today is\
  \ the day I\u2019ll reopen. I\u2019m Nor.\u201D \n\nAs he moved closer to us, we\
  \ noticed his deep, inquisitive eyes reflecting the fire he had lit. \n\n\u201C\
  What would you like to drink?\u201D he asked. Once we ordered, he set off to work.\
  \ He cracked open a dust-covered beer for Chris and plucked a flower hanging overhead\
  \ to place into my cocktail. He grabbed another grimy beer for himself and sat with\
  \ us. We sat beside him in silence for a few minutes, listening to the buzz of insects\
  \ and his cats rustling in the bushes. He was a man who didn\u2019t mind the silence;\
  \ in fact, he was in his element. \n\n\u201CI made this bar from everything I found\
  \ on the island,\u201D he started as he moved over to a seat made from an old scooter\
  \ and sat down, taking a sip of his beer. \u201CI was the third person here.\u201D\
  \n\nHe had wanted to get away from the crowds that were quickly taking over Phuket\
  \ in November of 2004, almost a month to the day before the Boxing Day Tsunami that\
  \ had claimed thousands of lives. \n\nWhile lucky to leave, Nor was tired of the\
  \ work and people in Phuket. He wanted to live off the land. He collected everything\
  \ he found lying around the island and created this place. \n\nIntrigued, we had\
  \ to know more about Nor. We asked how he was able to close Home Bar for four months.\
  \ \n\nHe leaned back against a tree, taking another sip of his beer. \u201CI decided\
  \ I wanted some peace and quiet. I\u2019ve hung out with my dogs and cats, fished\
  \ when I needed to, talked to my plants, and figured today is the day to reopen.\
  \ Life is too short to spend working. So, I work for a bit, and when I get tired\
  \ or want to be alone, I stop,\u201D he replied. \n\nHis words lingered with us.\
  \ Nor appeared to have so little, yet he held the secrets to living a life that\
  \ was wholly his. We couldn\u2019t help but reflect on the hustle back home, where\
  \ people live for money, material objects, and the appearance of \u201Chaving it\
  \ all.\u201D Could we let go of everything, just like Nor?\n\nWe let Nor\u2019s\
  \ wisdom seep into us as we left his world and the jungle behind, finding our way\
  \ back down the winding path to the beach. We would be leaving the island soon,\
  \ but somehow the thought of home was more unfamiliar to us than the feeling of\
  \ the sand between our toes."
