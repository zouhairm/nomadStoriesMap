Text: "Did your childhood dreams come true?\n\nFor years London was just a dream that\
  \ I put on a far shelf waiting for the right moment.\nYesterday my dream came true,\
  \ and I couldn\u2019t believe it the whole day, I walking in a comatose state, feeling\
  \ that I was in a movie or just sleeping.\nMy head is spinning, because everything\
  \ is very beautiful here, and I want to take a picture of every street and every\
  \ corner. At the same time catch a good shot - not an easy task, because of a lot\
  \ of people and cars.\nI remember that in the fifth grade of school in English classes\
  \ I carefully examined every picture in the textbook, which depicted London, and\
  \ presented myself there. So I walk along the Tower Bridge, here I stand at the\
  \ Buckingham Gate, and here is the magnificent Windsor Castle.\nI think that London\
  \ is a very romantic city. Such a gray, but with bright accents. Rainy, but with\
  \ glimpses of the sun. Like a sweet home, but so unexplored.\nI\u2019ve spent 10\
  \ days in Albion and I can\u2019t call it a read book, England is a centuries-old\
  \ story that can be studied during the whole life.\n\n- What\u2019s so unusual about\
  \ London?\n- I don\u2019t know. There is even another air - you take a deep breath\
  \ and get filled with enthusiasm.\n- Well, let's say, in Miami the air is cleaner\
  \ and fresher. Why is London anyway?\n- Air is an allegory. I mean, where is a special\
  \ atmosphere. So cozy and fun, but businesslike and serious. Here you want at the\
  \ same time to walk all day long, and sit down in some museum, studying something\
  \ new. The London museums are awesome - real palaces of knowledge, it's easy to\
  \ lose track of time in them.\n- What did you like the most?\n- It is difficult\
  \ to select only one place. Every day I visited from 2 to 5 places, and each deserves\
  \ attention.\n- Then what surprised you in London?\n- Sakura in Greenwich, in Windsor\
  \ and on some streets of the center. I thought it blooms only in Japan, but it turned\
  \ out that the UK also knows how \u201Cto bloom\u201D so brightly.\n- What about\
  \ the people here?\n- A lot of tourists in the city. What about the locals, it seemed\
  \ to me that everybody was on its own wave, but when asking for help, they gladly\
  \ answer the question.\n- If you moved to London, which district would you like\
  \ to live in?\n- Kensington or Notting-Hill. They are very cute.\n- What did the\
  \ city of foggy Albion teach you?\n- Oh, that you need to be able to react flexibly\
  \ when the situation changes. When I got ready to go to Greenwich, the trains on\
  \ the Jubilee line of the subway stopped the movement for a long time. As a result\
  \ on this day I went to Windsor, leaving Greenwich like a tidbit for the end of\
  \ my trip.\n- Have you been lucky with the weather during your trip?\n- Fifty fifty.\
  \ There were very warm and sunny days and heavy rains. What else is good about London\
  \ is that on a rainy day you will always find something to do here. Thanks again\
  \ to the huge museums and galleries.\n- Will you come to London again?\n- Of course,\
  \ as soon as I can.\n\nDreams should come true. They are our lighthouses. Dreams\
  \ help to navigate our lives, set the right priorities and go on our own path.\n\
  If a dream still lives only in your heart, let these words become for you the motivation\
  \ for its soonest realization."
