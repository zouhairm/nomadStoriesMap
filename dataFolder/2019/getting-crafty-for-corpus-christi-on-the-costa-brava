Text: "Sunday May 31st. The entire alleyway of Carrer de Sant Telm smells like coffee\
  \ and fresh petals, Catalan shouts ringing off its walls. To celebrate the festival\
  \ of Corpus Christi, which will culminate this evening with a musical parade through\
  \ the streets of Tossa de Mar, a team of locals are bent diligently on hands and\
  \ knees crafting floral artworks on the cobblestones. It\u2019s a feat of teamwork\
  \ that seems much-practised over the years, with a finely-evolved hierarchy dictating\
  \ our creative process. My friend Anna and I, living in Tossa for two months while\
  \ working as hostel receptionists, are honoured to be helping out. Penetrating the\
  \ social sphere of Tossa\u2019s local community hasn\u2019t featured much in our\
  \ time here so far due to the immersive nature of the hostel job: working, eating\
  \ and sleeping in the same building. When all your friendships are fleeting, as\
  \ the guests we bond with set off to continue their travels after a few days\u2019\
  \ stay, it is a privilege to meet the residents of our temporary home-town. We follow\
  \ their lead adorning our street with flower displays in preparation for tonight\u2019\
  s parade \u2013 gloved fingers scattering instant coffee, used in the art to resemble\
  \ earth, in between handfuls of petals smoothed into shape over carefully-drawn\
  \ templates.\n\nSpeaking only castellano Spanish, I can\u2019t understand the Catalan\
  \ communications between locals. I thus find myself mute in the collective rhythm\
  \ of passing tools, gathering materials and evening out their distribution across\
  \ the spread, grasping for common understanding through points and nods. I feel\
  \ like a novice; yet as a grey-haired lady comes to stand over the blue-and-white\
  \ section of image I\u2019ve been working on, she offers a smile of approbation\
  \ and I sense that my handiwork is appreciated. Gradually, the chalk-etched guidelines\
  \ are obscured and bloom into a carpet full of colour.\n\nTables are set up beside\
  \ the fruit of our labours for the highlight of the afternoon: lunch. My vegetarianism\
  \ proves the source of much amusement amongst the jam\xF3n-loving Catalonians, and\
  \ what I miss out on in roast chicken is more than made up for as my plate is heaped\
  \ with salad and mounds of patatas bravas. Multiple servings are obligatory, but\
  \ far from a hardship. Up and down the table, plastic cups of Estrella glint amber\
  \ as sunlight catches their bubbles. Chatting to those around me, I learn about\
  \ Tossa\u2019s history and the town\u2019s life outside its bustling touristic scene.\
  \ \n\nI am moved by the time that the slower pace of life here allows people to\
  \ attribute to family and community, and can\u2019t help but notice how much this\
  \ contrasts the rushed impersonality of London, where I grew up. There, the relaxed\
  \ atmosphere shared in by these neighbours lunching together outside in the street,\
  \ with all generations included \u2013 not to mention the addition of the glorious\
  \ Costa Brava weather \u2013 would be an unthinkable scenario. It\u2019s something\
  \ to take with me long after Corpus Christi\u2019s flower-works are trampled underfoot:\
  \ the pleasure of creativity, and occasional wisdom in being connected rather than\
  \ hurried. \n\nRosa, the hostel\u2019s cleaning-lady, who has just gulped down two\
  \ mojitos after steady beer refills throughout the meal, is cracking a stream of\
  \ jokes with bright eyes. As our interaction has generally been a mumbled exchange\
  \ of \u201Cbuenos d\xEDas\u201D while crossing paths half-asleep at seven a.m. in\
  \ the bathroom before starting shift, it\u2019s refreshing to see her so liberated.\
  \ I even witness my boss Dani enjoy multiple cigarettes \u2013 a habit reminiscent\
  \ of his party-boy nomadic youth, the lifestyle which ultimately inspired his creation\
  \ of Mana Mana Hostel. \n\n\u201CCoffee, anybody?\u201D a voice chimes, the phrase\
  \ suggesting the meal drawing to its close.\nA few of us raise our hands. We don\u2019\
  t know at this point that our artistic efforts will later win the prize for the\
  \ town\u2019s best-decorated street. Life at the hostel is hectic and I relish this\
  \ moment of peace. Children starting to fidget and half-tipsy adults swapping stories\
  \ are united in glee as cake as brought out. I savour the bubble of merry conversation\
  \ and scent of hot espresso now mingling with the coffee-powder aroma from the display,\
  \ both drifting skywards between cracks of Sunday afternoon sunshine."
