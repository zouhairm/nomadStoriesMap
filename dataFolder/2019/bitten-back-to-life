Text: "For some reason, my life became a big around the age of 27. I completely messed\
  \ up as I felt messed with: both my boyfriend and my boss made me feel unwanted\
  \ and not good enough, and so I quit my relationship and my job. The only problem\
  \ was that I also wanted to quit my life. For some reason, I was not a musician,\
  \ but I wanted to become a member of the famous 'Club 27'. When I tried to kill\
  \ myself, I failed and so I figured that God must have given me a reason to stay\
  \ alive. \n\nNot really sure about my destiny, I decided to give myself a break\
  \ and travel to India... one of the most spiritual countries in the world, a heaven\
  \ for New Agers, wanderers looking for self development, seekers of inner peace.\
  \ For about 30 days I traveled around, to Goa, to Kerala, to Hampi, to Rajasthan...\
  \ I embraced the art of Ayurvedic healing, yoga, meditation, ... I promised myself\
  \ to consider each person I met along the way as a teacher.  I truly believed that\
  \ people on the road were like mirrors trying to teach me life lessons. What I did\
  \ not know is that even animals could become teachers.\n\nOn one of my last destinations\
  \ during the journey, I went on a camel desert safari in Jaisalmer to watch the\
  \ Milky Way and all its stars. With a group of seven other backpackers and a camel\
  \ driver, I went out on a camel in the hot desert. Somewhere on the road, the Italian\
  \ girl in front of me lost her scarf. We stopped for her to pick it up and the camel\
  \ driver stopped the camels. They got close together. The camel behind me suddenly\
  \ came very close to me and tried to reach my head. I laughed and asked him: \"\
  Hi buddy, would you like a selfie?\", but before I even got an answer, he reached\
  \ out to bite me. I protected myself with my arm and got bitten right there. The\
  \ camel did not let go. In a good reflex I gave him my arm without trying to get\
  \ it loose again. The camel kept biting though until the camel driver started hitting\
  \ him and the camel finally let go. \n\n\"I am OK\", I said when the others asked\
  \ me if I was alright. \"I am OK, I am OK\", I kept saying. We still had to go another\
  \ fifteen minutes before we reached the camp, and I wasn't bleeding too bad, so\
  \ I figured it was alright to continue without urgent medical aid. I cleaned my\
  \ arm with anti-bacterial gel and so we continued. The rest of the journey through\
  \ the Thar Desert, I was in shock. I realized how lucky I had been that my arm was\
  \ still attached to my body, how lucky I was to be still alive. This could have\
  \ been so much worse. I cried tears of happiness. I was so thankful to be still\
  \ alive. \n\nDays later I realized that I found something in India I did not expect\
  \ to find: I was more than every grateful to be alive, and my life was the most\
  \ precious thing I had. No longer would I try to kill myself, or be killed by anyone,\
  \ let stand a camel bite. I wanted to be alive. Is it only until we almost lose\
  \ what we have, and when it is taken from us rather than taken by ourselves, that\
  \ we realize how much value something or someone has to us? One thing is for sure,\
  \ the camel bit me back to life. I will never try to kill myself again. I want to\
  \ be alive."
