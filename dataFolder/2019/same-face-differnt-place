Text: "I realized quickly during my I initial experience abroad that all people ,\
  \ places and culture , have a unique cultural strength to be shared and offered\
  \ during excursion and new experience. Listen, learn and implement a skill , mindset\
  \ or quality into your own lifestyle and offer the same to those you meet along\
  \ the way. I welcome global travels into my home through Couchsurfer and have been\
  \ blessed with wonderful new friends and experiences. I am wise because of shared\
  \ knowledge iv'e been  gifted from world companions. When I travel I stay with other\
  \ couchsurfer, eat, live and thrive in the local environment. \n\nI have recently\
  \ come to learn my primary genetic design is Quatar Egypitian , the belief is that\
  \ a stranger is a friend you have yet to meet, and a place is somewhere you have\
  \ yet to be. I'm driven and inspired by living. I've been taught one's authentic\
  \ self can be achieved by getting rid of half your possesions and replacing with\
  \ time and experience, that paired with offering at least one person the opperunities\
  \ you have been given. \n\n In December on my second trip to Latin America, I met\
  \ a woman with the same face in a different place,  while in Santiago Chile. Millions\
  \ of people more than half from Haiti and Venezela fleeing from dicators and oppresion.\
  \ I am blessed without guilt with every opportunity. To meet myself , same face\
  \ in a different place. Her name is Anna she she is in Chile to survive she left\
  \ Venezela after eating her dog and having money with no food to purchase in the\
  \ markets. I can help I said, she crys, I will host you in Canada as my guest. She\
  \ is arriving for one year in June to Ontario with her son to my home, I offer her\
  \ the opportunities I've been given she my friend with same face from a different\
  \ place. \n\nI am going to Isreal in May that is my next excursion , I travel, light,\
  \ eyes open, respectfully. To as many places as my life allows , I look forward\
  \ to each opportunity and am excited to host new global travellers, and meet the\
  \ stanger who are friends. I will offer frindship lessons, and come home with new\
  \ lessons to implement and improve my quality of life. \n\nOf course myself along\
  \ with all other applicants would love to be one of three chosen to travel with\
  \ Tim Neville on assignment  to Portugal. I would embrace each moment and offer\
  \ strong written word in exchange as a travel writer. I don't want to be differnt\
  \ , like everyone else. I am not like minded I see I approach each day differently\
  \ than most I know. I am a Crisis front line Social Worker by profession , they\
  \ call me Elvis  not sure why? \nI am good at helping those with addiction , crisis\
  \ and mental health, I am great at taking care of myself and my mindset as well.\
  \ I am a unique woman with alot to offer. I would be grateful to join the the team,\
  \ as a positive asset to the adventure.\n\nCarpe Diem"
