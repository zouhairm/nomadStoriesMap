Text: "Growing up in the middle of Brazil, I\u2019d never seen snow before in my life.\
  \ So you probably can imagine how excited I was when I landed in Montreal on Winter\
  \ time.  \n\nI like to stay at hostels, like most travelers, because it\u2019s cheap\
  \ and they usually have activities to help you meet people and the city. I chose\
  \ the Hosteling International Montreal. They are located downtown in a peaceful\
  \ and charming street. They had tickets to hockey matches, witch was a few meters\
  \ from there, to ice skating, to the Igloo Festival, a musical festival in the Old\
  \ Port region, where I got to do a snow angel for the first time. For me, it was\
  \ wonderful. I could experience all those things you see in movies. Sure, it's not\
  \ easy to deal with the cold and the snow but I fell in love with it. It is so calm,\
  \ immaculate.\n\nThe hostel had a pub crawl night. I\u2019d go every week. One of\
  \ the bars, The Mckibbin's, has trivia night. I loved it. On my third week there,\
  \ the trivia night was on Valentine\u2019s. I was excited. \n\nA couple of days\
  \ before that a group of Australian girls checked in. One in particular caught my\
  \ attention. She was redhead, tall and smiled with the eyes. I was leaving the hostel\
  \ when I first saw them and I overheard her saying something about why on earth\
  \ the Montreal Metro had to be so deep underground and jokingly complaining about\
  \ the stairs. They seemed fun to hang with and I wondered if they'd go to the next\
  \ pub crawl. \n\nThey did! When I went downstairs to the hostel bar they were there.\
  \ The hostel would start the night there, warming up for the night, giving us shots,\
  \ breaking the Ice. \u201CWe want smart people to team up for the trivia. What do\
  \ you do?\" one of them asked me. They were teachers and very competitive. When\
  \ I told I'm an engineer, the redhead immediately said \u201CWhat\u2019s up with\
  \ the metro here?\". I had their approval! So we headed to the bar.\n\nGetting there\
  \ we were supposed to form teams of five. I wasn\u2019t with the one I wanted but\
  \ I was with some of her friend. The game started, I found out that I\u2019m not\
  \ as smart as I though but it was fun. There were a lot of people there beside us.\
  \ One of the other teams were killing it. They'd got almost every question right.\
  \ One of their member, the most exhilarated, was a nerd-hipster kind of guy, with\
  \ suspenders and all. Good looking one, I have to admit.  At one of the breaks,\
  \ I saw the redhead talking with him while grabbing a beer. My heart stopped. That\
  \ smile, that hand moving her hair\u2026 They were flirting.\n\nThe trivia ended\
  \ and we headed to the next place. I can\u2019t remember exactly the place, only\
  \ that it was a club in the Crescent Street (one of the best region for night life\
  \ in Montreal: great bars, clubs, restaurants). I was relieved because nothing happened\
  \ between the two. So there was still hope for me. \n\nWhen I just finished that\
  \ thought, he bumped into me. Cleary in a rush, apologized and asked \"Are you with\
  \ the Australian girl? Where is she?\u201D. Obviously, I new who was \"she\" but\
  \ I tried to stall him \u201CWitch one? There are some Australians here\u2026\"\
  . It didn\u2019t matter. He found her and ran towards her. When she saw him, he\
  \ kissed her! \"I couldn\u2019t let you leave without doing this. It's Valentine's\
  \ Day\u201D, or something like it. It started to snow. Perfect timing. The audience\
  \ was all \"aww\". He slipped on the fresh snow on his way back, a perfect goofy-lovable\
  \ romcom character.\n\nI wasn\u2019t pleased, sure. Not in the mood to continuing\
  \ the journey, I left. The snow still falling on the walk back. How perfect It was.\
  \ It brought an atmosphere of tenderness to that romantic moment. It also made my\
  \ sorrow more profound. It\u2019s like the rain. But the rain is too dramatic. The\
  \ snow is elegant, subtle, instead. It felt a bittersweet sensation. Something I\u2019\
  d never expect to find."
