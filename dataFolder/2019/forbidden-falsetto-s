Text: "I never got beyond the walls. Perhaps if I spent less time trying to loop my\
  \ tongue around the strange sounds people sprout in my direction or if they understood\
  \ my mad gesturing language, maybe then I would've made it. But no, the gate closed\
  \ as I approached, my African limbs slow and stiffened by the freezing air. So the\
  \ City was doomed to stay forever Forbidden to me until some promise of an indefinite\
  \ return...\n\nAfter I spent the necessary minutes of shallow observation and appreciation\
  \ that any tired traveller can afford to a barricaded tourist site, I turned around\
  \ and unhurriedly retraced my steps, stopping every now and again to stare desolately\
  \ at the colourful wrappers caught in the frozen moat surrounding the Forbidden\
  \ City.\n\nIt was at one such a pause that a tiny Chinese lady approached me to,\
  \ softly, ask whether I would be kind enough to pose for a photo with herself and\
  \ her three, equally tiny, friends. Flattered as usual by the constant interest\
  \ that my curly blonde hair and blue eyes seemed to stir in the locals, I gladly\
  \ conceded.\n\nInevitably, after the photo, the question, \u201CWhere are you from?\u201D\
  \ followed, and with it, the pro-longed arm-tapping, hair-pulling, cheek-slapping\
  \ explanation that there was indeed white people in Africa. During this little palaver\
  \ I was invited to join them for a friendly cup of tea and as I had nothing left\
  \ to do for the next two hours of my layover I gratefully accepted and proceeded\
  \ to follow them through the grey street to what was apparently the most suitable\
  \ tea-house for the occasion.\n\nWe entered through a thick plastic curtain into\
  \ what seemed to be the reception of a slightly kitsch, but still upmarket, brothel.\
  \ The seemingly transgender \u2018receptionist\u2019 spat out a few syllables after\
  \ which my four hostess\u2019 urged me to follow them down a dingy, half-lit corridor.\
  \ I had my first doubts as I passed room after room each with its own blaring music\
  \ behind closed doors, and in my mind I assessed my chances of escape from four\
  \ Chinese women, all probably well-versed in some form of martial arts or at the\
  \ very least possessed superior intelligentsia. \n\nThe dread slowly increased when\
  \ we reached the very last door and I was hurried inside a compact room with two\
  \ couches and a large flat-screen TV, by that time I was quite convinced that I\
  \ have found myself in the midst of what might become a lesbian fiasco. The little\
  \ room was overheated and my \u2018friends\u2019 peeled of layer after layer of\
  \ clothing as I tried to keep my face calm whilst I poised, ready for the run, at\
  \ the edge of my seat.\n\nNow, imagine my utter surprise and relief, when one of\
  \ my potential traffickers suddenly turned my way and exclaimed, \u201CSOUTH AFRICA!\
  \ WAKA- WAKA!\u201D, turned the TV on and started to search for the song on the\
  \ karaoke system. A minute later my voice rose in confident false notes to Shakira\u2019\
  s 'Waka Waka', as the other women tried to master the African rhythms. After 'Lemon\
  \ Tree', they ordered tea, various colours swirling in glass pots too blistering\
  \ to touch. The fruits and nuts arrived after an exhausting throwback session of\
  \ Michael Jackson, our combined accents and terrible tremors adding new notes and\
  \ encores to every song. Britney Spears was celebrated by pouring glasses of Spanish\
  \ wine, merrily clinking it together after each of us made an overtly sentimental\
  \ toast on the New Year.\n\nI was made viciously aware of reality when an hour or\
  \ so later, one of the woman who has a suspicious likelihood of being one of those\
  \ unnecessarily strict teachers, tapped violently on her watch, ushered me outside\
  \ and pointed me into an unbeknown direction. So there I was, waddling in three\
  \ layers of clothing trying to enforce some speed into my legs while I searched\
  \ for the ever-evading subway entrance and navigating the maze which is Beijing\
  \ International Airport, just in time for my final flight home.\n\nI lifted off\
  \ from the city while four women\u2019s voices echoed in forbidding falsetto\u2019\
  s somewhere in the corner of a teahouse."
