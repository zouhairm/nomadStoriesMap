Text: "In the town of Yangshuo, Guangxi, China, there is a Canadian Korean couple\
  \ who fosters eleven children. Every child has a physical disability that demands\
  \ highly from the parents emotionally, mentally, physically, and financially. Profoundly,\
  \ these parents raise their children as if they are of their own blood. Here is\
  \ a glimpse of a foster family who calls themselves, \"Loving Home.\" \n\nAside\
  \ from being a father, Andrew takes on a role I find quite admirable. Thus, he is\
  \ who I call \u201CThe Firekeeper.\u201D As the \u201CThe Firekeeper,\" his role\
  \ is to make sure that his children are warm and safe every single night. He stays\
  \ by the rustic cylinders that tame the fire. His \u201Cbed\u201D consists to be\
  \ a hand-crafted wooden chair along with a thin cushion to suffice his needs of\
  \ comfort. Every two hours or so, he wakes up to make sure the house is not burnt\
  \ down. Although he has heavy bags under his eyes from the lack of sleep, \u201C\
  The Firekeeper's\u201D deep love for his family fuels him to watch the fire each\
  \ night. \n\nEven in the midst of her struggles with Lymphoma, the mother, Julie,\
  \ is determined to make sure her children have their daily needs met. She knows\
  \ the likes, dislikes, and even the silly quirks of them all. Julie likes to stay\
  \ behind the scenes and does not like to be applauded for her heroic actions. Never\
  \ have I heard her complain when the house gets chaotic. There is always at least\
  \ one child clinging onto her legs, saying \u201Cumma,\" which means \u201Cmom\u201D\
  \ in Korean repeatedly. \n\nLily is one of the children who will be hard to forget.\
  \ There was one moment where she was sitting across the couch, reading her book.\
  \ However, in the next moment, she set aside her book and walked towards me. She\
  \ took one side of my hair and gently pulled it back; she did the same for the other\
  \ side. Then, she looked me in the eyes and gave me her signature, subtle smile.\
  \ Afterward, she headed towards the couch and resumed her reading. Like a flower,\
  \ her presence is full of vibrancy. Never had I thought that a simple act of affection\
  \ would melt my heart so easily. \n\nFrom these two extraordinary parents, are the\
  \ children who have learned how to love the way their parents love. Although simple,\
  \ I was compelled and drawn in by the way they loved me. Despite the fact that I\
  \ was there only for the good four-and-a-half days, they chose to open up, show\
  \ acts of sincere kindness and offered me a piece of their heart. Not even a heavy\
  \ language barrier could hinder them from showing me this love. This family taught\
  \ me what it means to love with no calculations. They taught me how to keep my heart\
  \ open, even if it meant to risk getting hurt and vulnerable, which is often unheard\
  \ of back in the States. \n\nI remember Andrew thoughtfully sharing this statement\
  \ with me: \u201CI hope you have a peaceful mind when you think of Yangshuo when\
  \ you go back to America.\u201D Although he was busy working and caring for the\
  \ family, he was intentional with the visitors like me. He made sure that I understood\
  \ the deeper purpose to their family's lifestyle and unconventional decisions. He\
  \ desires for all to know that loving people and building relationships are the\
  \ most noteworthy accomplishments we can ever attain. There was a sense of freedom\
  \ he imparted to me. I am completely compelled to live abiding by this thought:\
  \ The freedom to live is birthed not from seeking after our own ambitions or successes,\
  \ but from generosity and selflessness."
