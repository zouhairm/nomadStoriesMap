  \ she said, as her bike came to a screeching halt in front of mine. Lost again.\
  \ This time in Tulum. \n\nI\u2019d met Ruby along with her two friends Nat and Ely\
  \ nearly two weeks earlier in Merida, the capital of the Yucatan Peninsula. Having\
  \ originally planned to head to Cancun I made a last minute decision to steer clear\
  \ of the party town and spend some time on my own. It had been a wild three months\
  \ in Mexico City. At 10pm I arrived in the town centre and began my walk through\
  \ the city centre to the hostel. For the first time in a long time I felt lonely,\
  \ missing not only my friends from home but the ones I\u2019d made in the last three\
  \ months. As my head hit the pillow in the hostel I was beginning to think that\
  \ alone time was overrated. \n\nThe next morning I got up early and went exploring\
  \ through the colonial city. In daylight I was able to see the brightly coloured\
  \ buildings and contrasting old buildings, cathedrals and leafy plazas. By the time\
  \ the afternoon hit, my stomach was full and my legs were tired; it was time to\
  \ head back to the hostel I\u2019d strategically booked because of its pool. \n\n\
  \u201CDid you see the map?\u201D Ruby asked me, concealing a knowing giggle. \n\
  I burst into hysterics. \nThe map? Gone. It had flown out of her basket about 15\
  \ minutes ago. We both saw it and both did nothing about it because we were both\
  \ overconfident in our misguided sense of direction. We slurped down our coronas\
  \ not wanting them to go warm and discussed options. It was obvious we were on the\
  \ right road however a wrong turn had landed us god knows how far in the wrong direction.\
  \ More laughter. \n\nI had taken a book to the pool, insistent on being antisocial\
  \ but Ruby and her two friends from England just so happened to be there also. I\
  \ fell in love with the infectious laughs and one-liners and by the next morning\
  \ at breakfast we were all getting along like old friends. I was off on a day trip\
  \ to the Celestun Wildlife Reserve but we made plans to meet up later that night,\
  \ after teasing me about going \u2018bird watching like a nana\u2019. \n\nAround\
  \ two hours drive from Merida, the wildlife reserve was home to colonies of American\
  \ Flamingos which had been on my bucket list for quite some time. The tour did not\
  \ disappoint and watching the pink birds soar across the ocean was awesome. The\
  \ were quirky, they didn\u2019t do things the same way as other birds, but still\
  \ got where they needed to go. The ocean had always been a place I would head to\
  \ clear my head and the stark contrast between my tropical surroundings and Mexico\
  \ City gave me a chance to reflect on the last three months of my travels. By the\
  \ time I got back on the bus heading for the hostel I\u2019d already decided on\
  \ ditching my planned solitude for my new amigos. \n\nOur night consisted of a delicious\
  \ dinner, night markets and a mezcal bar followed by a long and hilarious walk home\
  \ with all of us insistent on knowing where we were going. The girls had asked me\
  \ to come along with them to Valladolid the next day and then down to Belize after\
  \ that. We talked and laughed and argued over directions for the next two weeks.\
  \ I\u2019d got to see a lot of exciting places that I never would have if I hadn\u2019\
  t tagged along. Prior to Tulum, we\u2019d said goodbye to Ely and Nat. It was just\
  \ the two of us, our bikes and a long ride to Paradise beach. \n\nI was in no hurry.\
  \ Tomorrow Ruby and I would part ways. Our friendship was, like many things you\
  \ come across when travelling; unexpected...but one I would always remember as it\
  \ taught me to be content with whatever situation you find yourself in as you never\
  \ know what or who is around the corner or by the pool."
