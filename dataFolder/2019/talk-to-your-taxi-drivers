Text: "I was late. \n\nMy plane into Bali landed an hour past the expected time. It\
  \ wasn\u2019t my first time in Bali and regardless of the late landing, I wasn\u2019\
  t too worried about my scheduled pick-up from Ubud for my local guided camping and\
  \ sunrise trek up Mt. Batur that was taking place the next morning. \n\nThe following\
  \ day was my 30th birthday. I planned this specific trip to celebrate. Most people\
  \ head to the bar or to a fancy dinner with their friends. Not me, this year, I\
  \ decided to spend my birthday alone. A birthday alone was definitely atypical for\
  \ me as an ENFP.  Admittedly, I was somewhat regretting the choice not to go home\
  \ to Washington, DC for Christmas and to be doted on by family and friends for my\
  \ birthday. I live in Asia so staying for my much-anticipated break was an adventurous\
  \ but lonely choice for me. \n\nIn my solo travel in SE Asia, I have come to learn\
  \ the importance of talking to any local that will talk to me in the place that\
  \ I am visiting. Today was no different. As I exited the airport, the long line\
  \ of traffic signaled to me that while I was only about 35 kilometers away from\
  \ Ubud, the trek there was going to be unrelenting on the overcrowded one-lane streets.\
  \ I quickly entered the address to my hostel into Google Maps to reaffirm what I\
  \ had feared, the estimated time there was 2 and a half hours. Looking at my watch,\
  \ I knew I wasn\u2019t going to be in Ubud for my scheduled pick-up. \n\nI called\
  \ the company to let them know that I wasn\u2019t going to be ready for pickup on\
  \ time due to traffic from the airport. They sent me a WhatsApp number to my driver\
  \ who immediately started texting me with emojis and thumbs ups. This relaxed my\
  \ nerves. \n\n\u201CLet me know, you to hotel,\u201D he wrote in broken English\
  \ with 4 to 5 smiling faces. \n\n\u201CNo problem,\u201D I replied, \u201Cthank\
  \ you so much for waiting for me.\u201D\n\nThumbs up from him. \n\nWhen I arrived\
  \ to the hostel, he was there, ready to go. A young and cheery 19 year old Balinese\
  \ guy. \n\n\"Hi,\" he said and stuck out his hand to shake, \"My name is Armun.\"\
  \ He was smiling and warm and I could tell he was excited to talk with me. I apologized\
  \ again for being late and jumped into the passenger side of the car. Immediately,\
  \ I cracked a joke about the traffic and he started laughing. As we were driving,\
  \ he started sharing with me about his family. I told him my birthday was tomorrow\
  \ and that I was traveling alone. \n\n\"Where's your boyfriend?\" he asked. \n\n\
  \"No boyfriend for me,\" I replied somewhat embarrassed. I could tell from our rapport\
  \ that he was just trying to learn more about me. As we continued talking, Armun\
  \ shared with me about Bali tradition. He explained how children were named based\
  \ on the order they were born, Wayan for first, Komong for second and so on. \n\n\
  After a bit, we were silent for some of the drive. Armun broke the silence, \"You're\
  \ different,\" he said. \n\nSurprised, I asked him, \"What do you mean?\"\n\n\"\
  Most people don't talk to me in the car. They just expect me to drive them to and\
  \ from one place to another. They don't care to know about me or the Indonesian\
  \ people, but you, you asked me questions. I feel like we are friends. I started\
  \ driving so that I could learn English. My goal is to be in tourism and different\
  \ than my family in the farming.\" \n\nThis resonated with me. This was a guy who\
  \ simply wanted a better life for himself. He was working hard and making friends\
  \ through tourism to do so. He gave me the best birthday present I could ask for.\
  \ So, please always talk to your taxi drivers. You never know how you may impact\
  \ them."
