Text: "Conventional wisdom dictates that fourteen year old boys have limited priorities\
  \ in life, almost all of which are determined by hormones and an unabiding blood\
  \ lust for violent video games. As a timid gay boy, these themes eluded me. I instead\
  \ occupied myself with wistful, envious stares at my sister\u2019s morning makeup\
  \ routine, and found my mother\u2019s elaborate apricot scone recipe significantly\
  \ more enticing than the newest version of Call of Duty. \n\nPredictably, my discovery\
  \ of Downton Abbey (a perennial favorite of suburban mothers and Kate Middleton-wannabees\
  \ alike) during my sophomore year of high school absolutely delighted me. The poise,\
  \ refinement and exquisite taste in mid-century decor thrilled me; I awaited each\
  \ episode with bated breath, and my weekly visits to Downton became so critical\
  \ that they mirrored organized religion in their intensity.\n\nMy sister and nana\
  \ soon hopped on the bandwagon, and gradually my nuclear family transformed into\
  \ an extension of the Grantham clan. We spoke with their iconic British pithiness,\
  \ and we planned lavish dinner parties that even Lady Mary would have been proud\
  \ of. Eventually, our English inclinations reached a fervor so strong that my mother\
  \ booked us a trip to England and Ireland over my summer break, which I saw as my\
  \ opportunity to enmesh myself in the culture of Downton as holistically as possible.\n\
  \nWe visited Downton Abbey that trip, and I can say with certainty that my Mecca\
  \ did not disappoint. The estate\u2019s splendor astounded me, and I somehow fell\
  \ even deeper in love with the Granthams and their erudite manor. After leaving\
  \ Newbury, England, where Downton\u2019s Highclere Castle was located, we made our\
  \ trek to Kenmare in western Ireland. By that point of the trip, my sister and I\
  \ had adopted a cringe-worthy British accent that we\u2019d use when speaking to\
  \ each other. It was embarrassingly bad \u2014 my slight lisp certainly didn\u2019\
  t help \u2014 and we swore to only use it while communicating one-on-one, as a form\
  \ of secret sibling camaraderie. \n\nProblems with this strategy quickly unfolded\
  \ when we arrived at the hotel in Kenmare. Upon entering the room, my sister \u2014\
  \ in our classic British tongue - said that she was hungry and craved \u2018a nosh\
  \ of food\u2019. She left for the lobby to pick up snacks and remarked that she\u2019\
  d knock on the door once she\u2019d returned from her quest. A few moments later,\
  \ I heard a thudding on the door; assuming that it was her, I bellowed out \u201C\
  Who is it?\u201D in a horrifyingly poor English accent. Cackling erupted from behind\
  \ the door, and while I expected to hear a few chuckles from my sister, it certainly\
  \ didn\u2019t sound like her trademark chortles; I trudged timidly to the door and\
  \ opened it to see not my sister, but an Irish hotel maid nearly keeled over from\
  \ laughter. I began to blush as she continued her rapturous cackles, but eventually\
  \ she got up from the floor and we engaged in a wonderful conversation, one that\
  \ never would have materialized had it not been for my embarrassing infatuation\
  \ with Downton and my disgustingly dreadful accent abilities. Now I know: When traveling\
  \ in Europe, even the occasional humiliation can lead to meaningful interaction."
