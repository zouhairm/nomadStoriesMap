Text: "Getting to know the Camino\n\nFirst of all, I would like to start saying that\
  \ any trip you do is an experience and experiences are the best thing to grow as\
  \ a person and get to know yourself better. Thats something that happened to me.\
  \ I had the opportunity to walk the Camino de Santiago in Spain. People say the\
  \ Camino can change you and they are right, but I see it also as a push, a push\
  \ to start living the life that you want to live. Of course every \u201Ccamino\u201D\
  \ (way or path) is different for each of us, and the people that have done it will\
  \ say the same thing, there is no just one way to do it, just do it and see what\
  \ does it bring. Traveling this way, with a backpack and by feet, I learned that\
  \ there is no question, just leave out the question mark. You are, thats the only\
  \ thing you should care about. You are. You exist. Just live. Just breath.\nThe\
  \ idea of this trip came from my sister, who invited me, and I thought \u201Coh\
  \ this is cool, I love trekking and by that I will also learn to know Spain with\
  \ a different perspective that as a tourist you usually have. Also I am a religious\
  \ person so maybe this could help me to strength in my faith. So I started preparing.\
  \  \nThe Camino, its not just a personal experience, at the same time you are experiencing\
  \ internal changes, you enjoy and get to know a lot of Spain\u2019s history and\
  \ places. I started in France, St Jean Pied Port, a village placed in the frontier\
  \ with Spain. I cross the Apeninos mountains and it was amusing. With that first\
  \ walk I knew, I will go back.  You could see the sheeps and cows brazing and with\
  \ the bells ringing on theire neck, giving you the feeling of being inside a movie.\
  \ Never thought it could get better than that. But it did, every walk was a challenge\
  \ and every view a different escenareo of the sacred nature. \nThe first three days\
  \ I started realizing that this way of traveling - walking - helps you not just\
  \ to work out, think about your life and get to know the beautiful views and villages\
  \ you come cross, it gives you time to process this things and get to know all of\
  \ the people around you. By getting to know them you start learning about theirs\
  \ life\u2019s experiences and culture, giving you the chance to, while you walk,\
  \ feel as if you are traveling around lots of places of the world just by talking\
  \ and listening to their stories and experiences. This is something that makes you\
  \ realize that we are not that different after all, actually I was impressed with\
  \ how similar we all are. All of us chasing something, in different ways, but after\
  \ all looking for the same. \nI wasn\u2019t expecting this warm welcome from the\
  \ people of Spain and all around the glove.  Being a pilgrim of the Camino it is\
  \ one of the things I will always remember and cherish."
