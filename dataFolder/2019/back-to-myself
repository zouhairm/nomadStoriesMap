Text: It all started when I decided to continue my post graduate studies. I decided
  it then because I did not have more interesting options. I travelled to Barcelona
  to start my journey. There, I discovered I did not know much about myself. I am
  the character that is always trying to invest in herself, trying to progress continuously,
  trying to change, to adapt and to be as flexible as I should be. However, here I
  discovered it is not as I imagined. I discovered that I do not love loneliness as
  I imagined and that I need a partner at the end of the day, a partner to share stories
  with, to advice, to hug, to heal, to let you know that you are not alone. This was
  something really astonishing for me to know, as I always imagined I am really independent,
  and  I imagined that I really do not need any other one to complete me. The truth
  is that I am independent, but at the same time, I need a good supporting understanding
  partner. This was the first truth to know,and here followed many more truths. The
  other truth that I discovered that I am really flexible, flexible to the extent
  that I fear losing my real self when I am trying to adapt, I fear losing a real
  part of me for just trying to suit in somewhere. Moreover I discovered more about
  my strengths and more about my weaknesses, but to complete the story, I have to
  go somewhere else to see if I am really discovering my true self or it is just temporary
  discoveries.
