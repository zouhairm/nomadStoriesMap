Text: "I have missed many Trains. I used to be panic before but now it's cool! It's\
  \ me who avoid Watch. My mistake. So kudos to the consequences too. \nBut this Auto\
  \ driver was a Cherub. He made me win the Time. His roaring speed let me board the\
  \ Train. Wasn't willing to say goodbye to Agra but had to. Studies. Part time job.\
  \ Family. Expenses.Had to be back to my home.\nThose 8 days are captured in my Camera.\
  \ 4 handmade drawing sheets have the Diwan - E - Khas, Jama Masjid, Carvings of\
  \ Sikandra Fort, Rough Sketch of Heeng Mandi drawn by me. The tactile feel of those\
  \ Carved Stones and Marbles is still alive in my senses. \nThe geometrical patterns\
  \ in white and black stones were so balanced. The Rajasthani Traditional Arts on\
  \ the walls and ceilings of the Mughal Monuments are a big epitome of fusion of\
  \ Cultures, Religions, Boundaries... I found  rythm in their stories. \nI knew history\
  \ of India through books but being there in the City of Mughals imaginary snapshots\
  \ of the Rule, Battles, Mentality, Craft flashed in my eyes . The local guides told\
  \ many rumours, many facts, many places and many dishes I should try on my Journey.\n\
  Khasta Kachori the street food was the best breakfast flavoured with widening eyes\
  \ spices!! They were too spicy. And a twist of plain curd over that Potato Curry\
  \ with Crispy Kachori was just WOW!!\nThose Strawberry, Chocolate , Cashew,Rose\
  \ flavoured Sweet Indian Petha were the especial desserts of Agra.\nI was swapping\
  \ the photos in my Camera Gallery. A lady offering Namaz in the Mosque near Taj\
  \ Mahal. Her sons were playing around me when I was sketching.They were from Arab.\
  \ Kids were on a trip as their father died 10 months back. Their mom took them on\
  \ a trip to  move on in their lives. It was motivating to hear their story her innocent\
  \ son told me.\nThen came my Old Uncle's Pic. He was a security guard in Shyam Hotel\
  \ where I stayed. The Hotel was  equipped with just basic needs . No sophistication.\
  \ Just two days before when I left Agra he became my friend. It was at night 3 am\
  \ . I heard a hard hitting noise. The front glass of Hotel broke. I ran in hot haste\
  \ out of my room to know what happened.I came down. Uncle was abusing the guys who\
  \ threw stones at the Windows. I asked him about the matter. He told it was Shab\
  \ - E - Qadr Night in which many Muslims stay awake and Pray for whole night. But\
  \ few young guys fly on roads to reach the moon unapologetically on their bikes.\
  \ I called Police . They kept an eye  on  the hotel. \nThen came an image of my\
  \ Sketch I drew for 3 days in the Agra Fort . Deewan- E- Khaas.. It reminded me\
  \ when I asked a guide to help me know the way for drinking water in Fort. I was\
  \ tired . Sitting whole day in Sun drained my energy. He told water was available\
  \ outside the Fort. I asked him to buy it for me if he wanted me to be his customer.\
  \ I might be cheap . But I was thirsty. He agreed with a low murmuring abusive words\
  \ Calling me Eunuch. Well , yeah I am Gay. But not a transgender.It didn't matter\
  \ until he was listening me.\nI didn't expect to find this strong version of me\
  \ when I began my journey. It was the first day when an Auto Driver took me to a\
  \ wrong route . Trapped me. And the other Auto Driver passing by saved me from being\
  \ robbed. From a victim to a survivor. From a fragile guy to a smart guy. Visited\
  \ the City with a Jute Bag.Travelled by Local Buses and Autos.\nFrom a 'New City'\
  \ ,Agra turned into 'My City'. I wore Confidence and Believed my Journey.\nI still\
  \ remember when that helpful driver who saved me from robbers asked where to drop\
  \ me. And I replied Anywhere just away from 'Here'. He said \" Don't be scared,\
  \ you might be new to Agra. But the World is Yours. Explore it. Accept it . Learn\
  \ from the worst . Enjoy the ride...\""
