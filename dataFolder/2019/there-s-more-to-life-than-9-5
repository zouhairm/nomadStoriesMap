Text: "I was born and raised in a single-parent family where making money to support\
  \ their children was the one and only goal. i was raised to base your happiness\
  \ on how much money you were making, and planning every step along the way to ensure\
  \ it was enough. With that in mind, my mother is an extremely hard working parent,\
  \ and has to some extent been absorbed in the idea that more is better. Growing\
  \ up I knew nothing other than the next career move, and making six figures. That\
  \ is why my travel story starts after spending a month in Costa Rica, living with\
  \ a local family. Two weeks prior to leaving, I was offered a job working in renewable\
  \ energy, making a very good salary (for a newly grad), and was asked to start immediately.\
  \ I had to turn down the job as I had my Costa Rica trip coming up and would not\
  \ be able to start for another month. I asked the HR manager Nora, if I had lost\
  \ all chances of obtaining this position, she felt compassionate towards me and\
  \ said she would hold onto my resume and asked that I reach out to her when I got\
  \ back. I left for the month, came back , and reached out to her. Though I was disappointed\
  \ after not hearing from her for a few days, I could not detach myself from the\
  \ memories of my trip and the nostalgia I felt for months following. The happiness\
  \ not only, that I felt, but that I was surrounded in. These families were making\
  \ as much money as I would make in an hour, in a month - but they were happy. Truly\
  \ happy. A couple weeks upon my return, I received a phone call that completely\
  \ turned my life upside down. I was offered the position at the renewable energy\
  \ company and started the following week. I thought I was living the dream. I was\
  \ a newly grad, making more than most of my friends, and received two promotions\
  \ in a year. I was now a Project Manager for a renewable energy company. I had hit\
  \ my goal of making 60k+ and was well on my way to making my six figures. I should\
  \ have been ecstatic but instead, I was miserable. During all of this, I had been\
  \ so focused on my career I forgot there were other aspects to life. \n\nA few months\
  \ later, I was asked out on a date by a guy named Pablo. At first I was hesitant\
  \ to go as it had been so long, and I was super anxious at even the thought. My\
  \ friends convinced me to go, and before I knew it, I was having an amazing time.\
  \ I felt genuine happiness again. The feeling of home, just like in Costa Rica.\
  \ He opened up to me about how he too had an office job previously but was miserable,\
  \ so he quit and had been travelling since. I found it completely unattainable and\
  \ absurd. I knew no other way of life than the one I had been living. It felt so\
  \ surreal for him to do what he had been doing, that I felt almost uncomfortable\
  \ with the idea.\n\nIt took me months and many more dates with him to wrap my head\
  \ around this unattainable lifestyle. I remember him saying, you too could have\
  \ this. That's when I had my \"A-ha!\" moment. Like this illusion had finally become\
  \ reality. This not only inspired me but helped me realize the importance of not\
  \ controlling every aspect of my life and learning to leap into the unknown. Fast\
  \ forward 5 months, I have quit my job, moved across the country, and am planning\
  \ my next trip to Europe. This is the beginning of my leap into the unknown, and\
  \ I have to admit it is really scary not knowing. It's scary not planning every\
  \ aspect of my life from career, to love life, where I'll live, how many dogs or\
  \ kids I'll have. \n\nThough this all terrifies me, this is the most alive I have\
  \ ever felt. My travel story started when I realized there is more than 9-5."
