Text: "Memories were fading and as much as I was trying to remember the last time\
  \ I loved Joao, I couldn\u2019t dig into the past. All I could remember about our\
  \ trip to Morocco was not much related to him, and I did love Joao. Morocco had\
  \ been more about my own experience than ours. Did he understand? This trip was\
  \ supposed to be the profound way for us both to say goodbye, before he headed back\
  \ to Brazil.\n\nAll I knew about the Gate to Africa was that there, the streets\
  \ had no name and I would definitely get lost. I wasn\u2019t afraid. I am never\
  \ afraid when I travel. I was however in pain thinking that it would be the last\
  \ time I saw Joao. We kept quiet. \n \nOur main destination was a little camp in\
  \ the desert, 30 km away from Algeria. We started our trip  in Marrakesh, driving\
  \ through the Atlas Mountains, heading for the desert. Me and Joao, we weren\u2019\
  t talking much. The air in the car felt heavy, as if each one of us was trying to\
  \ fix his life and leave everything behind on every mile we drove, like traces to\
  \ be followed by other people, but never again by us. This was supposed to be our\
  \ medicine.\n\nWe agreed to have a last stop before the desert at Ali\u2019s house.\
  \ Ali, our tour guide, was loud and talkative. Yet, in his loudness there was a\
  \ beautiful silence and that made me feel at ease.\n\nThe heat and the smells along\
  \ the way were sometimes unbearable. I couldn\u2019t tell which one was harder to\
  \ bare, the scents and the sounds of Morocco or the distance and silence between\
  \ me and Joao. I imagined myself in an oven turned on at 250 degrees. I was burning\
  \ inside and outside.\n\nAli was practicing his Portuguese with Joao and from time\
  \ to time he was shouting \u201CAfrica!\u201D. Was I in Africa? Where does one start\
  \ to feel like being on another continent? \n\nWe passed Ouarzazate. With all the\
  \ dry landscapes and the heat, Morocco\u2019s mountains were refreshing. Here and\
  \ there, I would close my eyes and breathe heavily. \n\nWe parked the car at the\
  \ bottom of the village. I didn\u2019t know, nor had I any picture in my mind, about\
  \ how a Berber village looked like.\n\nWe were greeted by Ali\u2019s mother and\
  \ his younger sisters. They happily held my hands and walked us to the house. They\
  \ couldn\u2019t have been older than ten.\n\nThe village felt empty, the golden\
  \ ruins of sand were covering the horizon like there was nothing there. I saw poverty\
  \ and it hurt me. One could even wonder if there was any human touch around. I can\u2019\
  t explain why, but it felt like I was wrong, like something of who I was didn\u2019\
  t fit the picture. Had I known back then that this would change me, I would have\
  \ tried to capture the moment. The houses barely had a roof, a goat every now and\
  \ then. It almost broke me to think that me and Joao came to Morocco to say goodbye\
  \ to each other, but none of us knew how to be with each other at that stage. Still,\
  \ the Earth felt closer than ever and that was something powerful to live. I stopped.\
  \ I took a deep breath, I opened my eyes and what I saw now was tranquility. These\
  \ girls were happy just to see people in their house. It was that simple. I wanted\
  \ to scream. It was overwhelming, nevertheless, that purity opened my senses. I\
  \ felt connected.\n\nJoao looked at me, as if he understood me for the very first\
  \ time. He hugged me. I knew that I had unconsciously accepted that our story had\
  \ come to an end long before Morocco, but it was hard to let him go. I still don\u2019\
  t know how we managed to get to the desert, back to Marrakesh and to finally say\
  \ goodbye. Everything seems blurry. However, this experience saved us both from\
  \ a hatred goodbye and it helped me to accept that things change. I learned simplicity\
  \ for the first time and oh, what a striking thing."
