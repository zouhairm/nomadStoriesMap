Text: "It\u2019s a strange time for journalism- with fake news making headlines and\
  \ fact-based reports accused of being fake, leading to angry readers and viewers\
  \ lashing out at the watchdogs of society. \n       For most journalists, this is\
  \ an added difficulty to an already tough responsibility. For women journalists,\
  \ this new lack of trust is often the least of their worries.\n       Not only do\
  \ females in the US labour force still make around 70 cents to the man\u2019s dollar\
  \ and have a smaller chance of rising up to high-level positions than men, but they\
  \ still face high levels of degradation and harassment on a daily basis. This holds\
  \ true for female journalists as well, because with online and social media platforms,\
  \ female writers, broadcasters, and presenters receive many more hateful comments\
  \ than their male counterparts do, usually from anonymous males and often involving\
  \ things like violent threats or insults about their appearances.\n       Additionally,\
  \ among many American networks, like Fox News in particular, female reporters and\
  \ anchors are generally chosen to be aesthetically pleasing to audiences--young,\
  \ slender, and many times, blonde. The male presenters, on the other hand, stay\
  \ on camera as lead anchors or hosts until they\u2019re well into their fifties,\
  \ sixties, or later (Larry King, for instance). The females get noticed for their\
  \ clothing and makeup, while males get more attention for their interviewing skills.\
  \ Even in a more progressive country like Australia, there are examples of this.\
  \ Karl Stefanovic, a co-host of \u201CToday,\u201D an Australian morning news show,\
  \ was fed up with the appearance-focused criticisms on his female co-presenter.\
  \ He decided to wear the same blue suit on air during every single broadcast for\
  \ a year, and no one seemed to notice. He said about the experiment: \u201C\u2026\
  women, they wear the wrong colour and they get pulled up. They say the wrong thing\
  \ and there\u2019s thousands of tweets written about them\u2026I\u2019m judged on\
  \ my interviews, my appalling sense of humour\u2014on how I do my job basically.\
  \ Whereas women are quite often judged on what they\u2019re wearing or how their\
  \ hair is.\u201D\n       Although sexist ways of thinking are still quite prevalent\
  \ in all areas of the world and need to be addressed, the United Kingdom seems to\
  \ be a place where female journalists are considered equal to their male counterparts,\
  \ more often than not, and have their abilities as interviewers and presenters respected\
  \ above than their physical appearances. For instance, the BBC has a nearly equal\
  \ number of female and male journalists, reporters and presenters as well as an\
  \ impressively balanced ratio of men and women producers and other prestigious positions.\
  \ Pauline Lockwood, a producer of the BBC, says she feels respect and balance between\
  \ the two genders in the field is present in the UK. \u201CI think that at lower\
  \ levels, there are about the same amount of men and women\u2026but I also know\
  \ very successful [female] producers, senior producers that travel abroad, editors,\
  \ programme editors, etc.,\u201D she says. \u201CI think women are highly regarded\
  \ in journalism in the UK as a whole and [in] the BBC, especially, or [on] other\
  \ serious channels like ITV, Channel 4 News, and Sky News.\u201D\n        However,\
  \ Lockwood also says female journalists in Britain still have some obstacles to\
  \ face, especially for women with families. \u201CI think the problem is the same\
  \ as in the wider society, in that women will ultimately have children, for example\u201D\
  \ she says. \u201CThat can be a problem if you are a foreign correspondent who needs\
  \ to travel at a moment\u2019s notice.\u201D \n       Whether or not this is truly\
  \ a large factor for female journalists, it seems women have as equal a part in\
  \ the world of journalism in the United Kingdom as men do, and sometimes even have\
  \ the upper hand. It is a way of thinking about female journalists, female workers,\
  \ and females in general from which a majority of other places in the world can\
  \ learn. \u201CHaving said that,\u201D says Lockwood, \u201CI have never been made\
  \ to feel valued simply because I am woman. I feel that my male colleagues are smart,\
  \ modern, and fully supportive of women succeeding as much as they do.\u201D"
