Text: "Mistletoe. My driver Ara didn\u2019t know the word. He\u2019d never noticed\
  \ the plant in the treetops before. He\u2019d never heard of the parasite's association\
  \ both with Christmas and kissing.\n\nI wanted to spend Christmas Day in Armenia\
  \ visiting a church with 17th century frescoes. It\u2019s a long way South, right\
  \ on the border with Iran. We hadn\u2019t been driving long before I spotted the\
  \ mistletoe. Divine or Druidic intervention? Either way, it seemed like a good omen.\n\
  \nThe Mistletoe trail turned to a vale of tears.\n\nAra pointed out villages that\
  \ had once been peopled by Azeris\u2013 houses now empty for more than 20 years,\
  \ since their owners fled during the Nagoro-Karabakh conflict that split this part\
  \ of the Caucasus in two. \n\nWe drove through the Shurnukh, where Armenian flags\
  \ still fly.\n\n\u201CThis village was empty during the war\u201D said Ara \u201C\
  it wasn\u2019t safe. The Azeris were firing missiles from just over there\u201D\n\
  \nHe told me the story of a friend\u2019s father in second village close by.\n\n\
  \"He was hit by a missile and killed in the street\u201D he told me, and then pointed\
  \ to a lake where another disaster had struck the same family.\n\n\u201CArtak\u2019\
  s brother drowned here on a school trip\u201D he said \u201CAnother boy died trying\
  \ to save him. Artak\u2019s mother saw it all--nothing she could do\u201D\n\nI shivered\
  \ thinking of all the terrible Christmases that family had endured, but worse was\
  \ still to come.\n\n\u201CWe drivers call this the \u201Cbus turn\u201D. After the\
  \ war in the nineties there were a lot of mines along this road. A bus took a wide\
  \ turn one day and hit a mine hidden by the side of the road. The driver couldn\u2019\
  t have known. Many, many people died\u201D\n\nI was glad I hadn\u2019t asked Ara\
  \ to jump over a barrier to pick me some mistletoe.\n\n\u201CAnd just here. A monument\
  \ to two young men killed in the April war.\u201D\n\nThat was only three years ago\u2013\
  \ another  four-day spat with Azerbaijan. The sky was the blue of the Virgin Mary\u2019\
  s stole. But the ground all around us was black with wasted blood.\n\n\nOn the way\
  \ into the city of Kapan, a gorgeous  lake. We stopped to take photos.\n\n\u201C\
  The lake is poisoned\u201D said Ara \u201Cit looks beautiful, but it is toxic, filled\
  \ with run-off from the copper mine.\u201D\n\nWe stopped at Vahanavank Monastery\
  \ for a little solace. Here the dead have lain undisturbed for 10 centuries. There\
  \ were people here for many, many years before that. There is evidence of Bronze\
  \ age settlements from nine hundred and something BC.\n\n\nPast the dispirited mining\
  \ town of Kajaran, enlivened a little by a Soviet-era statue of a bear with a key\
  \ in its mouth.  Up, up into snow-covered mountains. We had been traveling for nearly\
  \ four hours and were more than 2300 meters above sea level. Trucks carrying sheep\
  \ were heading for Iran. These sheep will shipped all over the Middle East\u2013\
  \ Armenian lamb is said to taste sweeter than that raised in drier climes. The sheep\
  \ are exported live and so the trucks are covered with a sort of twiggy thatch.\
  \ They poor things can\u2019t see out, but air can get in. This way to the halal\
  \ butcher.\n\n\nThe sheep will never know it, but the road passes through stunning\
  \ scenery. The landscape changes every hour. By the time we dropped down from the\
  \ mountains I felt that all my available breath had already been taken. And then\
  \ I saw the jagged mountains of Iran. And the last persimmons growing on roadside\
  \ trees. And picked fruit drying in long strings hung on balconies and landings.\
  \ Kiwi fruit grew outside the church.\n\n\nWe were the only people looking at the\
  \ frescoes \u2014 which were worth a visit even if every inch of the rest of the\
  \ trip hadn\u2019t been so interesting. We touched the paintings. There was no sign\
  \ that said not to. No noticeboard with information. No postcards.\n\n\nWe sat in\
  \ the sun and had a picnic of lavash, green beans and white cheese. Ara had brought\
  \ some of his homemade wine. We got back to Goris to see the Christmas tree lit\
  \ in the city square, and in time for fireworks."
