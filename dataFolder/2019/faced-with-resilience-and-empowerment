Text: "Volunteering in Uganda was one of the best and most stimulating experiences\
  \ of my life. \nIt sounds clich\xE9 and stereotypical but it could not be truer.\
  \ \nBefore I went, people told me that I would come back a different person and\
  \ in many ways that is accurate. Perhaps not in my personality traits or habits,\
  \ but rather in my worldview and perspective on aid and development. \nThe dominant\
  \ portrayal of African countries that we are shown in the media frequently contains\
  \ images of destitution and extreme poverty. While indisputably there are many people\
  \ who live in such conditions, it is far too narrow and unrepresentative a view.\
  \ \nUganda is a country with wonderful people, music and culture. I made lifelong\
  \ friends and danced at every opportunity (and there were many). \nAs with anything,\
  \ my placement was not without its challenges. The misogynistic and what we would\
  \ consider \u2018old fashioned\u2019 structures that are present in Ugandan society\
  \ were hard to grasp and much work still needs to be done to combat such views.\
  \ However, the people that I met were not helpless or without a voice. They were\
  \ not dependent on aid from the West or incapable of empowering themselves.  \n\
  I saw this in my host father, a man who came from a very poor background by his\
  \ own description and is now a successful farmer, headteacher and the founder and\
  \ CEO of his own charity, World Resilience Uganda. This charity promotes improving\
  \ \u2018people\u2019s livelihood in the disadvantaged communities of Uganda\u2019\
  \ through entrepreneurial and micro-cottage skills development, environmental conservation\
  \ and human rights advocacy. \nThe schoolgirls I met during a debate we facilitated\
  \ fearlessly challenged the patriarchal structures of their society by standing\
  \ up for women\u2019s equality without the support of any of their male classmates\
  \ and won the debate. \nI saw power in the partially blind girl who supported all\
  \ of the events that we held and successfully made her own reusable sanitary pad.\
  \ \nI saw it in the young boy who was a loyal member of our youth group and a student\
  \ at the school we taught in and has plans to set up his own tomato farming business.\
  \ \nIn my team member\u2019s host brother who, despite having a rare skin condition\
  \ that set him apart in the community, is an amazing artist and runs his own printing\
  \ business which assisted us throughout our work in the community. \nI saw resilience\
  \ In my host mother who, in a society which frowns upon working women, is a school\
  \ teacher who farms alongside her husband, hosted me and the three other volunteers\
  \ and raises three beautiful young boys all under the age of 7. \nI saw it in the\
  \ young men who run the local chapatti and mandazi stand, working every day with\
  \ smiles on their faces and promoting and attending the events we ran, even getting\
  \ themselves tested for HIV at our health day. \nI saw it in the school teacher\
  \ at our youth group who stood up for herself and her rights in the midst of a heated\
  \ debate on gender-based violence despite being the only woman present. \nIn the\
  \ hundreds of students who attended our in-school health event, so eager to be given\
  \ the opportunity to freely discuss and inquire about their own sexual health and\
  \ reproductive rights. \nFor all of these amazing people that I had the privilege\
  \ of meeting, there are undoubtedly countless more in Uganda who demonstrate just\
  \ as much resourcefulness and independence. \nWe were not there to be \u2018saviours\u2019\
  \ to these people or drastically transform their lives through our interactions.\
  \ Rather, we were there provide access to the knowledge and tools they needed to\
  \ maximise their own potential and empower themselves long after we left, knowledge\
  \ and tools that we are all guilty of taking for granted in our own society.\nIndeed,\
  \ as much as I hope the people I worked with learnt valuable lessons and skills\
  \ from myself and my team, I learnt so much more from them. The potential, natural\
  \ leadership and initiative I saw in countless people, both young and old, was inspiring\
  \ and a testament to their strength of character. \nThey are role models for us\
  \ all."
