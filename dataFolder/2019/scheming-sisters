Text: "\u201CWhat have we gotten ourselves into?\u201D my sister said as we shared\
  \ a look of desperation and unknowingness. It was Christmas eve, and we had just\
  \ stepped off the boat into a deserted town with no stores open and no hostel booked\
  \ on the island of Chilo\xE9, Chile. Now we were taking in a sunset scene of an\
  \ old town with colorful houses on stilts standing over a shimmering lake. At the\
  \ same time, we were being pursued by a man who was trying to convince us to stay\
  \ at his cabana. \u201CToo late to turn back,\u201D I said as we marched forward\
  \ after escaping the man by telling him we had already booked a hostel.\n \nThe\
  \ previous day in a cozy hostel in Punta Arenas, Chile, we bundled up with 12 other\
  \ people in the kitchen with language bouncing from every corner including Portuguese,\
  \ French, Dutch, Spanish, and non-native English all coming together to make one\
  \ - we were all laughter and smiles. My sister and I made four batches of peanut\
  \ butter blossom cookies, including slightly burnt ones that the Dutch girl loved\
  \ and doughy ones that her Brazilian boyfriend preferred. \n \n\u201CWe have a poll\u2026\
  \ I\u2019ll trade a cookie for an answer!\u201D I joked at the hostel as I wished\
  \ people a Merry Christmas while learning a few words in their languages.\n \n\u201C\
  Should we spend Christmas in Chilo\xE9 or Valdivia?\u201D \n\n\u201CSkip Chilo\xE9\
  ; there's nothing there,\u201D the younger Chileans responded.\n \n\u201CBut the\
  \ photos of Chilo\xE9 look so beautiful,\u201D my sister exclaimed as I silently\
  \ rooted for Valdivia. \u201CFirst Chilo\xE9, then Valdivia. Let\u2019s do both!\u201D\
  \ I compromised. \n \nOur entire month of travel included showing up in a city without\
  \ booking anything in advance, and that had worked out well so far. Why would it\
  \ be any different during Christmas?\n \nShortly after heading off to find a place\
  \ to stay in Chilo\xE9 while old men stalked us in the shadows, we discovered that\
  \ finding anything open during Christmas was much more of a challenge than our previous\
  \ endeavors in other cities. We passed by various hostels with \u201Cclosed\u201D\
  \ signs on the doors and were almost to the point of thinking our only option was\
  \ to stay in the cabana of the creepy stalker man. We finally saw a sign that made\
  \ our chest leap - an open hostel. Empty, but cozy. \n  \nLooking out the window\
  \ of our room with eight beds for the two of us, and hoping for something, though\
  \ unsure of what, we saw a male backpacker walking down the road towards our hostel,\
  \ pull out a map, and stop nearby. I opened the window and shouted nervously across\
  \ the deserted, echoing street, \u201CHey! Do you speak English?\u201D\n \nConfused\
  \ and looking back for a moment at the girl that just asked him a question (but\
  \ that came out more of a screaming demand), he looked back and said, \u201CUh,\
  \ yes\u2026\u201D\n \n\u201CWell, you should come to stay here. It\u2019s nice,\u201D\
  \ I coaxed, trying to convince our only hope of company and feeling of safety. I\
  \ realized I couldn\u2019t have picked a better backpacker to scream at.\n \nAs\
  \ he put his bag down in our room, he casually said, \u201CI have an entire rotisserie\
  \ chicken, potatoes, vegetables, dessert, and wine in my backpack, should we have\
  \ a Christmas Eve dinner?\u201D\n \n\u201CI need to shout at random backpackers\
  \ more often\u2026\u201D I thought, taken aback while devouring a delicious meal\
  \ over candlelight.\n \nDays later we found our tired, slightly shaken selves in\
  \ a fancy, American-style restaurant in the busy city of Puc\xF3n for breakfast,\
  \ back to our comfort zone. We soaked up the comfort and stillness of doing nothing\
  \ crazy as my sister asked, \u201CSo, what should we do today?\u201D\n \n\u201C\
  Skydiving, obviously,\u201D I joked as we both laughed at the idea of something\
  \ we both swore to never do in our lives.\n \nThen we met eyes over our caf\xE9\
  \ con leche with a look that set our plans for the day in a binding contract that\
  \ could only be established by scheming sisters looking for their next adventure\
  \ into the unknown."
