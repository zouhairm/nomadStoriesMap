Text: "It was a hot morning in Montezuma, Costa Rica and the walk down the hill to\
  \ the village was agony.  I was only half way down the hill when a young man on\
  \ a motorbike stopped. \u201CSenorita, I take you to bottom of hill if you like.\u201D\
  \ He was wearing a nice shirt and khaki shorts which gave him an air of coolness\
  \ and confidence - like he often picked up strange women walking down that hill.\
  \ I saw no harm and a few minutes later, he dropped me off at the beach.  \n\nA\
  \ storm had passed near Montezuma the previous night and the water was extremely\
  \ rough. The smell of Cerviche and Empanadas in the restaurant a few meters away\
  \ filled the air. I found some shade under a tree and the sounds of palm trees rustling\
  \ in the breeze and waves crashing onshore gently lulled me to sleep.  \n\nBy late-morning,\
  \ the heat was getting to me. I was craving a refreshing fruit smoothie, so off\
  \ I went in search of one. At the end of a street, I noticed an outdoor smoothie\
  \ bar. A friendly, young man was eager to take on the challenge of making me something\
  \ that was refreshing but not-too-sweet. It took a while for him to make it as he\
  \ carefully thought out each ingredient and made sure it was mixed to perfection.\
  \ He placed his finished masterpiece before me. For the price of three Canadian\
  \ dollars, I received a delicious, green-colored smoothie in a massive glass\u2026\
  and a lesson in life that I would not soon forget.\n\n\u201CSo, are you from around\
  \ here?\u201D I asked him.  \u201CYes, born and raised in Costa Rica.\u201D He said\
  \ proudly and asked if I knew what \"Pura Vida\" meant.  To me \"Pura Vida\" meant\
  \ The Pure Life. Natural, untouched, simple and pure. He went on to explain it in\
  \ more depth for me. \u201CThat is how most people interpret it. You see, 'Pura\
  \ Vida' can be a greeting, a state of mind, a way of life. You meet someone walking\
  \ down the street, you say 'Pura Vida'.  You catch the perfect wave while surfing,\
  \ you say 'Pura Vida'. You have a wonderful day, instead of saying goodnight, you\
  \ say 'Pura Vida'. You find a great smoothie bar while walking the streets of Montezuma,\
  \ you say 'Pura Vida'. It can mean anything but always something good. Anytime something\
  \ good happens, 'Pura Vida' is the appropriate thing to say.\u201D Made sense to\
  \ me. How can you not be living the \u201CPura Vida\u201D in a country that is considered\
  \ to be one of the happiest in the world?  I feel so lucky to be able to say that\
  \ I experienced Pura Vida first hand and have been able to apply it to my daily\
  \ life at home.  \n\nI've since embraced minimalism, positivity and a slower pace.\
  \  Every time I find myself getting overworked, overwhelmed or just plain stressed\
  \ out, I close my eyes and replay that conversation I had with the lively young\
  \ man with the dreadlocks and penchant for making the best fruit smoothies I've\
  \ ever had.  Then I imagine I'm lying on that sandy beach falling asleep to the\
  \ sound of leaves rustling in the wind and waves crashing onshore and everything\
  \ is good again.  Living the Pura Vida Canadian-style since 2013!"
