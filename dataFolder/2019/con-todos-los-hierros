Text: "As I entered the kitchen, my mother was cooking for us and she had just turned\
  \ around to go and see my young brother was ready or not. That was the very first\
  \ time when I kneaded some dough for her so that she could quickly make bread for\
  \ our school tiffin. I still remember that warm smile on her face. It was from then\
  \ I have been cooking for my family delightfully. \nTraveling with a partner who\
  \ loves eating, my curiosity for knowing different culture around the globe through\
  \ their food has grown deeper since getting married to my husband. People bring\
  \ souvenirs wherever they travel, I bring the recipes and spices back home. \nCuba\
  \ was one of the countries which astounded me the way people have the passion for\
  \ the sustenance that nourishes the soul and the stomach. While we were communicating\
  \ through head bobs and hand gestures trying to know the local people and their\
  \ food, we had somehow managed to get the etecsa internet card, found the right\
  \ spot in the public park to get a good connection and booked an Airbnb experience\
  \ to cook with a local Cuban family.\nWe were all ready, waiting off the street\
  \ trying to take a taxi.  \n\u201CDon\u2019t worry we will get the taxi, we will\
  \ be there on time\u201D, My Husband said.\nSweltering in the punishing temperatures\
  \ of a typical fall early afternoon in Havana, we finally reached the home where\
  \ the family welcomed us with tight hugs. Our translator Tina told us that meat\
  \ represents a level of luxury and abundance reserved for special occasions and\
  \ honored guests for Cuban people. Many Cuban families lost more than food on their\
  \ table during the \u201CSpecial Period\u201D an era from 1990 to 1998 where strict\
  \ rations imposed on them which included a monthly per person limits of a few pounds\
  \ of rice, beans, salt, sugar, coffee, egg, and buns. \nThe Cuban population mainly\
  \ lives in \u201CSolars\u201D. A solar is a building that used to house only one\
  \ family and that has been transformed into a multi-family \u201Ccoop\u201D due\
  \ to the increase of the population and the lack of space.\n\u201C\xBFEst\xE1n listos,\
  \ chicos?\u201D (Are you ready, friends?) host said.\nEveryone in the living room\
  \ accompanied the host and Tina to this big kitchen and common dining room area\
  \ full of Cuban spices and coffee aroma.  Food in a Cuban home is definitely enjoyed\
  \ for hours over conversations beginning early afternoon and last long night. \n\
  \u201CAre you from India?\u201D Host said.\n\u201CYes,\u201D I said.\nWith that\
  \ warm smile on her face and knowing little English. \u201CWe love India, good friend\u2026\
  ..good friend.\u201D Host said.\nWhile helping cut the pineapple for the curry I\
  \ asked. \u201CCan you tell me what\u2019s the reason for adding these bones to\
  \ this pork stew?\u201D \n\u201CCubans don\u2019t eat hotdogs with \u201Call the\
  \ trimmings,\u201D they eat them with \u201Call the irons\u201D (con todos los hierros).\u201D\
  \ Host said. \nAnd then there was a good laugh for a moment.\nWith all the laughter,\
  \ fried plantains, beef buns, pork stew, mango salsa, the most important part of\
  \ the Cuban meal rice and beans, the night ended with a small toast over a coffee\
  \ and guava sweet. Dropping us out to our respective taxis they arranged for us,\
  \ the host took a long sip of coffee and pointed excitedly at a bird flying. \u201C\
  Mira r\xE1pido, es tocoroco!\u201D El ave nacional de Cuba por dos razones. Una\
  \ de las causas de sus plumas rojas, blancas y azules. Y el otro es p\xE1jaro que\
  \ muere si se mantiene en cautiverio. Esa ave es cuba. Ese p\xE1jaro soy yo.\n(Look\
  \ quickly, it's tocorooco. The national bird of Cuba for two reasons. One because\
  \ of her red, white and blue feathers. And the other one is  this bird dies if held\
  \ in captivity. That bird is Cuba. That bird is me.)"
