Text: "I didn't expect to find a link between Portugal's magnificent azulejo Tiles\
  \ and the historic diet and cuisine of Portugal.\n\nThe amazingly ornate, and detailed\
  \ tiles stem from kenophobia ('the fear of the empty'). Is this Horror Vacui style\
  \ obsessed with the psychology of horror?  What was the terror or fear which infected\
  \ the azulejos? Why did the entire tile require ornamentation with arabesques, tessalations,\
  \  flourishes, calligraphy, medallions, vegetal and geometric motifs till no white\
  \ space remained?  Was there a Jinn, demon, or unseen monster, inspiring the terror\
  \ behind the Horror Vacui?  \n\nPanels of tile mosaic were revealed to Portugal's\
  \ King Dom Manuel I after a visit to Seville, Spain in 1503.   The glazing techniques\
  \ of cuerda seca ('dry string') and cuenca ('artista') were brought to Portugal.\
  \   The decorated polychromed ceramic tiles were laid on walls and paved the floors\
  \ within rooms of his Palace of Sintra (a UNESCO World Heritage site). This exquisite\
  \ Mud\xE9jar art decoration, the azulejo tile, adorned the Manueline or Portugal\
  \ late gothic style of architecture. \n\nKing Manuel I, a deeply religous man, embraced\
  \ Christianity whole-heartedly.  Yet, in this Kingdom of Portugal and the Algarves,\
  \ the Portuguese adopted the Moorish tradition of horror vacui ('fear of empty spaces')\
  \ and covered walls with azulejos. The 16th century saw the elite, the landlords,\
  \ royalty and bishops financing elaborate churches, ecclesiastical buildings, royal\
  \ and aristocratic residences, and large buildings. Portugal formally established\
  \ a vast overseas empire and foreign trade brought wealth. \n\nThe first ceramic\
  \ tiles were rich in interlaced foliage, tendrils, spirals, and repeating motifs\
  \ geometric patterns in the arabesque  Moorish style of the middle ages.  The bilderverbot\
  \ ('aniconism') style soon gave way to historical commemorations and Christian legend\
  \ with human and animal figures depicted within the exquisite, decorative designs.\
  \  One theory behind the ornate artwork is to honour by resplendent decoration by\
  \ depicting that which is considered luxurious, beautiful, heavenly and paradisical.\
  \ \n\nBut why did the azulejos take over Portugal?  Why do these decorative tiles\
  \ overwhelm the eye everywhere one turns?  Is not society shaped by its history,\
  \ culture, diet, faith traditions and social relations? Is Anthelme Brillat-Savarin\
  \ correct, \u201CDis-moi ce que tu manges, je te dirai ce que tu es\u201D (You are\
  \ what you eat'?)  Does not this \u201Cmood\u201D  move the hearts and minds of\
  \ men? \n\nWhat happened historically?  Portugal showed a sharp increase in the\
  \ growing of corn which occurred at the end of the Portugese Rennaissance, the transition\
  \ from the Middle Ages (5th to the 15th century ) to the Early Modern Era  (16th\
  \ through the 18th centuries). \n\nAdditionally, the end of the 15th century saw\
  \ harsh winters and high amounts of snowfall, only to be followed by periods of\
  \ drought and famine in the early 16th century.  Historians comment on the coincidence\
  \ of climatic conditions when delving into the epidemics and plagues of the era.\
  \  \n\nThe population grew during this inflationary era.  The price of meat sky-rocketed.\
  \ The main food of the Portugese population was white maize made into a bread called\
  \ broa, and soups made from dried beans, olive oil and cabbage greens, and of this\
  \ diet, maize was the staple.  Broa, is a Portugese corn bread traditionally baked\
  \ in a brick or stone oven filled with steam. \n\nAs a result of this diet, signs\
  \ of pellagra soon appeared.  Psychological symptoms were depression, and an exaggerated\
  \ anxiety; residents became terrifically overwrought with worry about their future,\
  \ and the sickness they saw around them.  Other neurological manifestations included\
  \ irritability, sleep disturbances, overly emotional states, along with outbursts\
  \ of aggression.\n\nThus, underlying the cultural fabric of Portugal of the Early\
  \ Modern Era was a vitamin deficiency.  Was the population of Portugal desperate\
  \ to find relief from the ravages and despair of Pellagra? Would  people wracked\
  \ under the turbulence of the disease seek out the soothing and alleviating respite\
  \ of the glorious azulejo.  Would the assuaging imagery promise calmness and confidence\
  \ in their future?  Would the azulejos with their spellbinding ornateness, sanctify\
  \ and redeem them all?  Could the polished stone known as azulejo remove the devastation\
  \ of famine, illness, misery, and suffering and provide the feeling of safety and\
  \ well-being?\n\nIn Portugal, discover the azulejo, and realize the answers to these\
  \ questions."
