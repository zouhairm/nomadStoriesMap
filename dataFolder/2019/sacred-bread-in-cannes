Text: "After a hot, budget-burning day among the glitzy guidebook sites of Cannes,\
  \ I was trudging out of that posh French city alone\u2014defeated, the hostels full\u2014\
  when a beat-up hatchback pulled over unsolicited. I peered in at the driver: young,\
  \ Arabic, earnest eyes, car trunk full of plastic bags stuffed with old bread. He\
  \ stared pokerfaced back at me, my tent, my cheap travel guitar.\n\t\u201CYou shouldn\u2019\
  t be here,\u201D he said in French.\n\tHe meant walking that road, but he\u2019\
  d also pegged my deeper dilemma. I\u2019d been backpacking the wine-rich Loire and\
  \ red-carpet Riviera on a shoestring, and by now I felt misplaced, in need of a\
  \ new direction. So when he opened the passenger door, I got in.\n\tHe pulled into\
  \ a spartan brick apartment complex on the city\u2019s working-class fringe, introduced\
  \ himself as Waled, and quickly scanned the area.\n\t\u201CThe men here \u2026 They\
  \ think in the old way. OK?\u201D\n\tI trailed him to his building, passing old\
  \ bearded men on the walkways. One stopped Waled and spoke in whispers, a wary eye\
  \ aimed at me, and Waled appeared to plead my case. But inside his meager closet\
  \ of a room I questioned myself: his castoff futon and makeshift coffee table left\
  \ only a narrow strip of spare floor. I\u2019d come to France for old-world inspiration,\
  \ or my idea of it. This felt off-course. I set my things down, but Waled was raring\
  \ to leave.\n\t\u201CWant to bring the guitar?\u201D\n\nHe gave me the off-guidebook\
  \ tour, skipping the belle \xE9poque hotels of La Croissette and palm-lined Chemin\
  \ des \xC9toiles to wander among the gritty unsung back lanes of Le Suquet, the\
  \ multicolor serpentine old quarter. We ate succulent lamb shawarmas from an unnamed\
  \ stand and slipped into a secluded alley joint full of mismatched tables and ornate\
  \ hookahs, where two old Arab men sat nursing tea and watching a dusty TV. They\
  \ shot guarded glances at me. I got the point: this wasn\u2019t the C\xF4te d\u2019\
  Azur of haute cuisine, private waterfronts and chic film festivals, but it was still\
  \ members only.\n\tWe grabbed a table anyway. A stout man in a sharp robe appeared\
  \ from the back and argued with Waled in Arabic, but soon we had our own loaded\
  \ hookah, a glowing disc of coal on top, and demitasses of rich espresso. We took\
  \ turns smoking, the smooth honey vapor an instant salve, and confided like gambling\
  \ buddies despite the raucous foreign news on TV. Waled\u2019s family had been part\
  \ of a long Tunisian diaspora that had favored Sud de France since the \u201960s.\
  \ They had a strong community here, close ties, steady jobs\u2014his at a bakery.\n\
  \t\u201CThe bread in your trunk?\u201D I asked.\n\t\u201CFor the birds,\u201D he\
  \ said. \u201CBread is sacred.\u201D\n\tWaled dreamed of visiting the U.S. Some\
  \ places there, I warned, would be riskier for him than others. But I couldn\u2019\
  t say if that was the old way in my country, or the new one. I gazed through the\
  \ smoke into the cobbled alley. What was the American dream now? Maybe I was finally\
  \ waking up from it, far away, with this openhanded stranger.\n\tWe carried my guitar\
  \ past the overrun All\xE9es de la Libert\xE9 and yacht-choked Quai St. Pierre to\
  \ where some locals were shirking the city\u2019s celebrity beaches for a barebones\
  \ view of the sea from one of the Vieux Port piers. I joined them, assuming Waled\
  \ would too, and played what requests I could manage. But he hung back from the\
  \ water, waving me on as if he\u2019d brought me just to observe his wager.\n\n\
  Back at Waled\u2019s I showered. When I came out he was gone. In the hall, I heard\
  \ singing upstairs\u2014a rich lonesome voice, incanting in Arabic. I crept up the\
  \ stairway and froze: out on the roof Waled was kneeling, forehead to the rug as\
  \ the old man with him prayed.\n\tI hurried downstairs undetected, and that night\
  \ Waled surrendered his futon to me, insisting that he sleep on that narrow strip\
  \ of floor.\n\tIn the morning we swung by his bakery before dropping me near the\
  \ autoroute to Monaco, where Waled presented me with a still-warm baguette, avoiding\
  \ my eyes. But as he pulled away we shared a conspiratorial gaze."
