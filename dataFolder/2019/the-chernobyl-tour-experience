Text: "On January 14th, I embarked on a tour to the Chernobyl Exclusion Zone (CEZ).\
  \ Only having found out about the still radioactive, mostly abandoned exclusion\
  \ zone less than a week beforehand, I was nervous, but excited to go.\n\nIn the\
  \ morning of April 26th, 1986, reactor #4 at the nuclear power plant of Chernobyl\
  \ exploded, creating one of the most powerful nuclear accidents in history. The\
  \ nearby town of Pripyat, 3km from Chernobyl, was evacuated a few days later due\
  \ to high levels of radiation. However, the 58,000 citizens of Pripyat were told\
  \ to only pack enough for 3 days, so ended up having to leave most of their belongings\
  \ behind.\n\nIt is estimated that close to 1,000,000 people died of radioactive\
  \ poisoning from Chernobyl, but official numbers have never been recorded. It\u2019\
  s difficult to comprehend the effects of the radiation damage on the population,\
  \ but it is known that people will be affected by the radiation for generations\
  \ to come.\n\nI have a strange fascination with abandoned places, so upon hearing\
  \ about Chernobyl, I knew I had to go. A group of about 15 of us \u2013 from around\
  \ the world, boarded a bus to the CEZ, where less than 10,000 tourists go per year.\
  \ Having had little sleep the night before, I slept the whole bus ride, and woke\
  \ up just in time for a passport check at the first of two checkpoints. This was\
  \ the entrance to the CEZ, and was 30km away from the main plant and Pripyat. Our\
  \ passports were thoroughly checked, and we signed our lives away on a waiver (explaining\
  \ that if we got enough radiation on our belongs, they would have to be left behind).\n\
  \nWe continued to Chornobyl, a town completely composed of workers, who were working\
  \ on containing the exploded plant. After the explosion, workers put a dome over\
  \ reactor #4 to stop the spread of radiation, and to cover the lead they initially\
  \ threw in to stop the fire. The lead is collapsing, and would cause another explosion\
  \ if it did, so workers are trying to dismantle the lead and building quickly.\n\
  \nDriving on to the plant and Pripyat, we passed the second checkpoint, and passports\
  \ were checked again. We stopped at the dome and reactor #4, but were only allowed\
  \ to take photos from 300 metres away, and were instructed to point our cameras\
  \ only in the direction of the dome.\n\nStopping at the famous Pripyat sign briefly\
  \ for photos, we continued to Pripyat. I was mesmerized, seeing so many abandoned\
  \ buildings, it was easy to tell they had been abandoned for some time, as nature\
  \ had taken over.\n\nWe stopped at a Kindergarten, and it was obvious that some\
  \ objects had been moved into certain positions for tourism purposes, but the feeling\
  \ you got from the place was completely bone-chilling. I had shivers for the rest\
  \ of our time in Pripyat; it felt weird to have what was once such a thriving, beautiful\
  \ town, be now overgrown and unlivable.\n\nThe tour continued to other sites in\
  \ Pripyat, including a school and a community centre, with a huge pool. We were\
  \ able to freely wander around the school, and it was spooky seeing all the school\
  \ materials scattered everywhere, like they were just dropped quickly from the evacuation.\n\
  \nWe were instructed at the beginning of the tour to not touch anything, due to\
  \ the high amount of radiation, and we didn\u2019t even want to. Everything was\
  \ clearly falling apart and rusting badly, so we had to duck our heads down to avoid\
  \ pieces of metal falling from the ceiling.\n\nThe best part of the tour, was the\
  \ abandoned amusement park. Seeing the Ferris wheel, and other smaller rides abandoned,\
  \ was extremely depressing. The amusement park was scheduled to open just a few\
  \ weeks after the explosion.\n\nWe then headed back to the checkpoints, and were\
  \ checked for the amount of radiation we had acquired on our visit. All clear, thank\
  \ goodness! The amount of radiation you actually experience on the day trip is equivalent\
  \ to a mid-haul flight.\n\nIf you ever have a chance to do the Chernobyl tour, I\
  \ would highly recommend the bone-chilling visit."
