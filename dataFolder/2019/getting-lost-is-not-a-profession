Text: "At the age of twenty-four, I found myself without a job, a home, or a town\
  \ to call my own. My apartment lease had ended in the lakeside town where I had\
  \ just finished my summer at a seasonal job. I applied for housing in a couple new\
  \ towns, but nothing stood out. Friends and family began to panic at the unknowing\
  \ of my future.\nBut I decided it was all a sign that I should take advantage of\
  \ my mobility, my anonymity. I booked a one-way ticket to South America. Only days\
  \ later, I watched familiar land grow smaller beneath me from the window of a plane.\
  \ I arrived in Mendoza, breathing unfamiliar air under the shadow of the Andes.\n\
  The first night, I lay awake as I welcomed loneliness in like an old friend. It\
  \ watched it cast shadows on the walls of the hostel, I saw it in the dreams of\
  \ my nearly sleepless night. \nThe next morning, I rose with an urge to get lost.\
  \ I wandered the wide forested city streets, under bright purple bougainvillea that\
  \ stretched up towards the Argentinian sun. I got distracted by colorful blankets\
  \ and brightly colored signs perched outside restaurants.\nThe further I wandered,\
  \ the more I became comfortable in the distractions of this unfamiliarity.\nI got\
  \ lost in recognized words of eavesdropped conversations, constructing responses\
  \ in my head, pretending for just a moment that we shared the same language. I got\
  \ lost trying to exist naturally as a pedestrian in their traffic, how to move between\
  \ their every day.\nIn my imagination, I pictured myself walking back from class\
  \ at the university to an apartment on villa nueva that hums with chatter from a\
  \ string of nearby bars. I imagined a place to call my own in this foreign city.\n\
  I floated through South America for eight weeks, returning back home with a new\
  \ definition of what it is like to be lost.  I realized I am comfortable in my own\
  \ discomfort - wandering streets alone and watching loneliness rise with the moon.\n\
  I returned ready for a job, a home, a town to call my own - my next leap into the\
  \ unknown."
