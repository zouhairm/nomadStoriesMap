Text: "As I wait for help to arrive, I think back to the night before. This remote\
  \ Icelandic harbor seemed more\ninnocent then, as we took selfies of the realistic\
  \ flesh wounds we'd learned how to\nconstruct out of gelatin, glycerin, and dye;\
  \ played with bags of fake blood worn\nunder our clothing; admired burns made from\
  \ paint swabs and astroturf. It seemed a sort of game, then - a whole town preparing\
  \ for an all-hands-on-deck scenario. Even myself, just a visitor passing through,\
  \ had a role to play. That seemed fitting, I thought, since I'm one small droplet\
  \ in the global flood of tourism here that precipitates a drill like this one in\
  \ the first place.\n\nRight now, though, lying down on a windy tussock, hidden from\
  \ the crowd surrounding the growing column of acrid, oily smoke pluming upward from\
  \ the wreckage, all I can think is that I am very cold. My bare feet, they are especially\n\
  cold. At this stage, it's mildly concerning. \n\nHofn, Iceland is a five-hour bus\
  \ ride from nowhere, a cold harbor at the rough,\nglacier-scoured edge of a still-mostly-wild\
  \ island. It's home to fishermen and scientists, with\ntheir catches in decline\
  \ and their glaciers in retreat. Catering to the new Icelandic industry of\nfishing\
  \ for tourists, everything here is in the process of becoming a guesthouse - even\
  \ the pub\nand the old fish-packing plant.\n\nTo be here, almost by definition,\
  \ is to take several steps closer to the earth in its\nrawest, churning forms, to\
  \ its elemental fire and ice. Indeed, the medieval gateway to hell is\nnot 100 miles\
  \ from here, at Mt. Hekla. A 1585 map caption shows it as \"perpetually\ncondemned\
  \ to storms and snow, vomit[ing] stones under terrible noise\". To me, though, the\n\
  freedom to roam through Iceland's wide-open spaces feels like heaven.\n\nHere, October\
  \ is a time of dwindling daylight, glacial crosswinds, and fermented shark\nmeat.\
  \ Like every town in Iceland, Hofn hosts a public bath, heated by the geothermal\
  \ stew\njust below our feet. Mostly outdoors, it's the de facto social scene for\
  \ the\ntown, the rare spot where visitors and locals can commingle without freezing.\
  \ Foreign travelers swap tips\non how to survive in a land of $12 beers, while local\
  \ kids dare each other to jump from the\nheated pool into a barrel of ice-cold water.\n\
  \nUntil very recently, the thin band of pavement that constitutes the country's\
  \ main\nroad ended here, in the southeast corner. In this land shaped by natural\
  \ and economic disasters, where volcanoes often erupt, rivers \nbecome torrents\
  \ in the blink of an eye, and governments fall nearly every Tuesday, preparation\
  \ for future disaster is a cultural pastime, a question of \"when\", not \"if\"\
  . \n\nI have wandered to the edge of the island, and from\nthere managed to wander\
  \ even further, losing my shoes to an unforeseen bog in the process. Barefoot, lying\
  \ down\nand shivering on the barren ground, exposed to the elements and a stone's\
  \ throw from the\nindifferent waters of the Hornafj\xF6r\xF0ur, I let out an involuntary\
  \ chuckle, caught up in this\ncircle of life imitating art imitating life. The goal\
  \ had been to create as lifelike a simulation as possible; to spur real emotions\
  \ and authentic reactions. For me, it was working almost too well. \n\nMy instructions\
  \ were clear: Run. Hide. Wait. Less clear was the timing. All I could do was lie\
  \ back, rub my feet, and listen for the thrumming sound of the rescue helicopter,\
  \ descending from above."
