Text: "Last year I went to a trip of delhousie in Himachal Pradesh for tracking. When\
  \ I went through railway from my city it was peaceful and pleasant weather but,\
  \ when I arrived there it was snowing at that place so, I have to track 3-4 km to\
  \ reached my hotel (hotel was on mountains so) I was so excited because my purpose\
  \ for this trip is track and explore the place I always dreaming. After that finally\
  \ I was reached to my hotel it was pretty good experience because that was my first\
  \ time to track in the surface of snow. Hotel was pretty cool it contains each and\
  \ every modern facilities. First thing first I ask to take my order for my dinner\
  \ after that I ask to give me a key of my room.  All the services that provided\
  \ in hotel was great as well as people who works there know how to treat their guests.\
  \ Moreover, food was mouthwatering \U0001F924 and delicious \U0001F60D. It was Indian\
  \ traditional food Which contains lots of nutrients and it's helpful for me to regain\
  \ my energy. Next day my friends arrived from different locations. Then finally\
  \ we began to travel outside the hotel. First thing in morning I wanted to see the\
  \ sunrise I always dreamed to see sunrise and sunset from those mountain with the\
  \ snow I seen those scenario number of times in movies but, I want to see from my\
  \ eyes and live that moment. I was so excited and with my friends we sit down and\
  \ waited for moment and that seen still mesmerised me and I still remember that\
  \ seen. We click number of pictures and few of them I uploaded in Instagram. Our\
  \ goal was track 10000 ft. So, we started exploring new places near to our hotel\
  \ and asked Dwellers about famous places, clothing, and all. They responded properly\
  \ and they are so kind. Basically in that place most of people live who works in\
  \ India army. That place in specially for tourists. Then we find a market where\
  \ we can find number of traditional clothes and the wooden craft of that place where\
  \ written delhousie, and keychains for your Kith and kin. I bought a wooden craft\
  \ for showcase and 3 keychain one for my elder brother and one for my elder sister\
  \ and one for my special friend. And eventually we also find a snow point place\
  \ which is so famous we went there and sit for while then again I was hungry so\
  \ we ordered Maggie it was delicious the way they make. But, in few seconds it's\
  \ started at Normal temperature. So we eat fast. And near to that we find place\
  \ church which was built in 18th century in this place the craving and crafting\
  \ was undecriable. And we click innumerable pictures. On second day we celebrated\
  \ through the snow fighting and creating snow man and all.  We created a Laddy snow\
  \ everyone laughing because we created something new. And I think it was fantastic\
  \ \U0001F923\U0001F602. Further, we recorded some slow motion video we playing with\
  \ snow. And 3rd day we heard a place where on hotel was in middle of mountain and\
  \ also consistent a lack it was pretty. I loved that moment because we have to climb\
  \ first to reach \U0001F60D and eat place like that unthinkable. And food of that\
  \ delicious. And finally in forth day we track 7000ft where we camped and make food\
  \ by ourselves that night we danced a lot and place truth and dare game where we\
  \ find something new about each other and make to do some amazing tasks. And then\
  \ we got sleep in the morning we finally climbed at 10000ft. And feel the air around\
  \ us like we are finally free from this world, and inherent fresh air. At that place\
  \ rock climbing and all those activities are famous so we tried it. And in evening\
  \ we watched the sunset that was \U0001F929. In 6th day a lack which is so famous\
  \ and looks like a sneak which is popular so we track through bus there and did\
  \ some water activities. To recapitulate, it was one of my dream trip."
