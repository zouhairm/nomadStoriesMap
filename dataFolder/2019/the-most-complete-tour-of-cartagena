Text: "A couple of years ago, I was on vacation taking advantage of my uncle's working\
  \ season in the coastal city, so I had free lodging. The only bad thing was that\
  \ he lived exactly on the opposite corner of the map of what is known as the tourist\
  \ area. The trip was low budget, so I decided to take an informal bus know as \"\
  buseta\" to go to the famous beaches of Bocagrande.\nI have to start explaining\
  \ you that we, the latin americans have a very energetic personality, so with this\
  \ preliminary, you should know that you do not go to take the bus... the bus takes\
  \ you. -Take it, take it!- screams the driver to the \"sparring\" (you can guess\
  \ why they call him like that), his assistant who is hanging from some tube, with\
  \ more than half a body outside, he quickly explains me all the destinations, invites\
  \ me to take the bus, fits me in a seat and collects the money, all in less than\
  \ 5 seconds.\nEverything starts at the famous Avenida Pedro de Heredia; the avenue\
  \ that connects the entire city from north to south. The buseta has the name 'Beef'\
  \ in all your windows, thunderous with their horns and alarms that do not stop ringing,\
  \ really, they do not stop ringing during the entire tour, they are always ringing\
  \ in the background. I found different messages stamped on their cans already oxidized\
  \ by the saltpeter, from verses of the Bible to phrases burlesque of viral events\
  \ of social networks as \"El tormento tuyo soy yo\" -search it on Internet, you\
  \ will laugh- and with heavy and dark curtains that they decorate and warm up the\
  \ vehicle in a city with an average temperature of 89\xB0F. The driver, who believes\
  \ he is a Formula 1 pilot has the accelerator in depth. The sparring, who does not\
  \ stop screaming encouraging people to fill the quota, such as fishing rod in fish\
  \ Hatchery:-Come on, climb up that the plane sinks!-, among other phrases, which\
  \ are really funny and illogical. \nGoing by buseta, is the perfect opportunity\
  \ to have diverse encounters with the people who seek their daily sustenance through\
  \ this means of transport; religious vallenato singers, pic\xF3 rap dancers (yes,\
  \ they are dancing with the car on movement), salesperson or simple people who are\
  \ going to work in the luxury hotels and finally, I, the only person who goes with\
  \ swimsuits, beach clothes, sunglasses, floats and suntan lotion in the beach bag.\n\
  We passed by the market of Bazurto, in the background in the highest mountain of\
  \ the city you can see the Cerro de la Popa, where there is an old convent. Later,\
  \ we passed to the front of the castle of San Felipe de Barajas, a fortification\
  \ built more than 400 years ago, we can also see the monument to The Old Shoes,\
  \ then, we approach a roundabout where is the monument to India Catalina and we\
  \ tour the entire walled city. The traffic is now lighter and returns the pilot\
  \ of Formula 1, in a race across the Avenue Santander passing through the Pier of\
  \ the Bodeguita. For $1, I do a complete tour and I know the dynamics of the city.\
  \ A tour that shows an obvious contrast between the popular neighborhoods of Cartagena\
  \ and the most luxurious, a tour where I could really know the city, not only the\
  \ touristy allowed. \nThe bus is already empty. -Stop! It is what the passengers\
  \ shouted. That's right, a shout is the warning of arrival at your destination,\
  \ for these people, the doorbell does not exist and there are not scheduled stops.\
  \ The atmosphere is calmer now, and I am already in front of the beaches of Bocagrande.\n\
  \nIt is amazing how we can get to value this kind of common actions as what is to\
  \ take a bus, if you live in a different context, with a specific situation, becomes\
  \ an experience. How nice it is to learn how to live in other regions and realize\
  \ that this cultural diversity is what makes us so rich and fortunate to live in\
  \ this world.\n\nDo you accept to take the tour in Cartagena?"
