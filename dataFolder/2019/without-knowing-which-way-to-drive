Text: "Duong is a 23 years old girl. She lives around the big capital, Hanoi, and\
  \ every day she wakes up early morning to go to work at the train station. \nBefore\
  \ going to work he needs to help her mother with the awakening of the farm, and\
  \ this is something she loves deeply.\nJust the week before, next to the hens' patio,\
  \ she had planted her first ecological vegetable, according to his grandfather's\
  \ teachings; her expectations about organic cultivation are high but she ignores\
  \ what, in a few days, will change her life forever.\nAnna is Italian, she is 28\
  \ years old and her only desire is to save the world, even knowing that it is impossible\
  \ to do much alone, but she believes in cosmic energy that everything can do; ah,\
  \ she really loves animals!\n\nDuong works at the train station from 10 am till5\
  \ pm, she has just started this job and is doing a little bit of everything.\nIn\
  \ the early morning, she cleans the trains have traveled at night; the number of\
  \ things forgotten by the passengers is staggering. \nAs his grandmother used to\
  \ say, people might forget their heads if they did not stick it around their necks\n\
  How true it is!\nThen she gives the change to Luan, waiting for her to go for breakfast.\n\
  Luan is assigned to passenger tickets, but Luna does not like this job, he hates\
  \ waking up early in the morning and having to talk to people.  \nOn the contrary,\
  \ Duong is very happy when he works at the ticket office and thanks to a train ticket\
  \ for Sapa he knows Anna for the first time.\nAnna had just left the umpteenth job;\
  \ she never had trouble finding one, but finding something to really satisfy her,\
  \ that was the big problem.\nHer friends were her family, and now more than ever,\
  \ she was determined to make a long and timeless journey, where for once she would\
  \ not have to worry about what time it was or what to do the next day.\nObviously\
  \ giving everything a specific meaning"
