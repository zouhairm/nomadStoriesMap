Text: "Being a very chaotic soul I always find a different sense of peace in pieces\
  \ of ART. It started with a call from the person who makes my deep down wishes comes\
  \ true. He is an artist yes. All excited he called me in the evening to take me\
  \ to this really interesting cool place and I said yes to in the very next second.\n\
  \nNext day, this melodious adventure starts off in the afternoon. The sun was up\
  \ it's ending of the winters in India. I took the metro to reach the place Jor Bagh.\
  \ He was waiting out there I could feel the vibes all over or around me retrouvaille.\
  \ We were happy, walking and listening to old 90's songs to that place called Art\
  \ for all. There I entered a little part of creative world created by a punch of\
  \ artists for people like us. \n\nAs I walked in the whole vibe filled my Dusa.\n\
  There is this room where with songs playing in it every wall is painted with the\
  \ sound waves of that song. For a moment I was lost in it. But as I was told again\
  \ and again about this room half filled with foam confetti. I was so very excited\
  \ to go there. I jumped in we swimmed and the little confetti balls were all over\
  \ and inside our clothes. I felt the kid alive in both of our bodies. We headed\
  \ next to many magical rooms the place have and ended up relaxing over it's terrace.\
  \ The people out there were happy, alive. Experiencing that human connection and\
  \ sharing our little stories under the blue sky, slight warm wind, the sun is setting.\
  \ It felt all magical. And then we walked out wishing other people good bye. \n\n\
  The day isn't over yet. We walked back to his place and watch sunset. Climbing up\
  \ on the terrace I saw the natural life among the modern society houses which seemed\
  \ dead. There is this house like in the villages with a tree inside, cooking with\
  \ fire of woods, childrens playing. I could hear their voices, laughs. It seemed\
  \ like they happen to preserve the natural way of living a life. I looked up in\
  \ the the sky which turned more blue with a couple of stars shinning bright. I wasn't\
  \ home but I was home it felt like that."
