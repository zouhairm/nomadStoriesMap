Text: "It was the hot, sweltering month of June in 2012 that I found myself walking\
  \ along the cobbled streets of Granada. The Spanish summer is a pain, I heard, and\
  \ yet I found it to be quite magical: the days are warm and excruciatingly long,\
  \ but I was on a rooftop patio in Albayzin with caf\xE9 con leche in my hand when\
  \ the sun was gently lowering itself over the imposing grandeur of the Alhambra.\
  \ Nighttime beckons and daylight gradually left me, one rooftop at a time. From\
  \ my vantage point, my eyes witnessed how the township of Albayzin and the city\
  \ of Granada as a whole was swiftly overtaken by the dark after being swathed in\
  \ sunlight \u2013 truly a sight to behold.\n\nI also remember the clear summer skies\
  \ of Barcelona that went on endlessly. It was a sheer blanket of pristine azure,\
  \ uninterrupted by clouds. I could look at it forever. I didn\u2019t expect summer\
  \ in Spain to have a kind of magnetic charm. Coming to Spain for three weeks for\
  \ a summer course was already a leap into the unknown to me, as I had never travelled\
  \ this far before, all alone. Barcelona was my first taste of Europe, surprisingly.\
  \ I had always thought that my first ever foray into Europe and the \u2018Western\u2019\
  \ world at large would be some typical English-speaking, Anglo-Saxon city, like\
  \ London. But as fate would have it, I found myself leaving my children behind on\
  \ a long-haul red-eye that was bound for a cosmopolitan and vibrant city along the\
  \ Mediterranean coastlines; I was giddy with enthusiasm, not knowing what to expect.\n\
  \nI didn\u2019t do much research, and therein lies part of the charm. Not all those\
  \ who wander are lost, says Tolkien. Spain is an eclectic blend of history, modernity,\
  \ culture and identity all intricately woven into a colourful and unique tapestry\
  \ that sets it apart from many of its European neighbours. It is deeply rooted in\
  \ its history, progressive in its bid for modernity, rich in the myriad of cultures\
  \ that it represents, and unapologetic in its identity. I was happily lost in this\
  \ tapestry and didn\u2019t want to get out. Barcelona won me over with its unbridled\
  \ worship of Gaud\xED; I could stand in La Sagrada Familia for hours and bask in\
  \ the mosaic of colours that the superbly long stained-glass windows and the bright\
  \ sunlight outside bring. The exterior of the basilica look impossibly foreboding\
  \ from afar, and yet the interior tells a different story. The contrast in itself\
  \ is intriguing as it is appealing.\n\nIf one could pick a place where one would\
  \ experience Spain in a single location, I would choose the captivating Plaza de\
  \ Espa\xF1a. It is a huge piece of architecture that flaunts an ingenius fusion\
  \ of Islamic ifluence with Renaissance characterictics, resuting in an eclectic\
  \ style of its own. It is warm, inviting, enchanting and stunning all at once, much\
  \ like Spain in the summer. I still remember the shards of sunlight that dance on\
  \ the cobbled streets of Granada, broken by hanging ivy from the walls. I want to\
  \ go back to that moment in time again, again, and again."
