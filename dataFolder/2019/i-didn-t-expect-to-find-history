Text: "People go to Florida daily. Sugary sands, bustling streets, Hispanic culture,\
  \ sea shells and kitschy souvenirs are everywhere. There are gelato shops, bakeries\
  \ and restaurants on every corner. To add a bit of touristy flair, there are cobblestone\
  \ streets, carriage rides and even a pirate boat adventure. But, let\u2019s talk\
  \ about what I didn\u2019t expect on this trip to St Augustine, Florida. \n The\
  \ lighthouse and maritime museum was just as expected. The grounds are beautiful,\
  \ surrounded by decades old trees dripping in Spanish moss and old buildings such\
  \ as the keeper\u2019s house. Climbing the 219 stairs to the top was breathtaking\
  \ and of course I had to snap a dozen photos.  I didn\u2019t expect to learn it\
  \ had been there since the 1500\u2019s. How many landmarks are that old? Maybe you\
  \ can name a few, but I can\u2019t. \nThere are forts galore in St. Augustine. I\
  \ walked around Castillo de San Marcos for a couple hours.  I imagined how the moat\
  \ and drawbridge must have looked and climbed the towers to see the view. What I\
  \ didn\u2019t know, was that the fort had been in possession by military forces\
  \ for 251 years and that it was declared a National Monument in 1924. It made me\
  \ wonder, what was the earliest that anything in America became a National Monument?\
  \ I also visited Fort Matanzas National Monument which seems hard to believe that\
  \ people actually lived there while on duty. But the real point of interest was\
  \ Fort Mose. There, I learned that slaves were actually encouraged to flee to this\
  \ portion of Florida to be free. Why hadn\u2019t anyone told me this in school?\
  \ I devoured the pamphlet they provided and bought the book in the gift shop. I\
  \ was completely enthralled by the fact that it was the first legally sanctioned\
  \ free black town in North America \u2013 and it was in \u201Cthe south\u201D. The\
  \ tour guide had stated that when the British were attacking, blacks stood side-by-side\
  \ with Native Americans and white Spaniards to defend their piece of freedom. \n\
  When driving around through the town, I saw the bridge of lions and tried in vain\
  \ to snap a photo. I saw the sign for the oldest alligator farm but couldn\u2019\
  t stop in time to go see it and I did make a stop at Ponce de Leon's Fountain of\
  \ Youth.  FYI: It tasted terrible. I also drove past 79 Bridge Street. Rumor has\
  \ it that this was the headquarters of the civil rights movement in the old city.\
  \ I asked my tour guide about the history of the civil rights movement here and\
  \ was told that there is no official record but there is a story that he\u2019d\
  \ stayed with Janie Price for a bit at 156 Martin Luther King Jr. Avenue. For me,\
  \ this prompted more investigation because I knew about memorials for Dr. Martin\
  \ Luther King Jr. in Atlanta, DC, Alabama and Memphis but I didn\u2019t know anything\
  \ about his visit to St. Augustine, Florida. I pressed my tour guide for more information.\
  \ I was informed that King had come to St. Augustine in 1964, the year of St. Augustine\u2019\
  s 400th anniversary, and he had been arrested for attempting to eat at a segregated\
  \ restaurant at the same time activists descended on the city. Many were arrested\
  \ that day for protesting, many had been beaten by members of the Ku Klux Klan and\
  \ the owner of a pool that was for white use only, used acid to get rid of some\
  \ mixed race people who had showed up there. Because of all the attention these\
  \ things received, the Senate voted to end an 83-day filibuster of the Civil Rights\
  \ Act. King left town on July 1, the day before President Lyndon B. Johnson signed\
  \ the landmark anti-segregation bill into law.\nI learned so much on that trip,\
  \ more than I even thought I would. I took home more than just a vial of sand and\
  \ a few sea shells from the sea shore. I took home knowledge. I took home history."
