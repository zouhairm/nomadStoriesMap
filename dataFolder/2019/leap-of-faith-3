  \ it was slightly more than that. My heart sank, and I braced for the news.\n\n\
  I had just landed in Paris. My friend had arranged for us to stay in her friend\u2019\
  s apartment and the three of us would see the city together. This was my first time\
  \ in Paris - my first time abroad - and I had trusted someone else to take care\
  \ of the details.\n\nThe problem was that our host had decided that she didn\u2019\
  t want me to stay at her place, in fact, she was angry that I was there at all.\
  \ The ride into the city was uncomfortable and silent. I was dropped off at a hotel\
  \ near the Arc de Triomphe and coldly told they would park and meet me at a cafe\
  \ in a half hour.\n\nI watched them drive away and fought the urge to cry. Every\
  \ bone in my body wanted me to go back to the airport, go back home. It seemed the\
  \ only sane option, or at least better than being stuck with a woman who apparently\
  \ hated me, a friend who was frantic, and a ruined trip.\n\nFor a moment I was frozen,\
  \ then I looked at the newstand draped with French newspapers, smiled at the woman\
  \ walking two small dogs, and listened to the language as people passed. I was in\
  \ Paris. I was in PARIS! I was in Paris and I was just given a golden opportunity\
  \ to explore the city for myself. \n\nThe decision was made; it was time to be bold,\
  \ to close my eyes and jump into an adventure of my own making.\n\nMy \u2018friends\u2019\
  \ arrived; one a bit salty that I had decided to stay, the other a bit amazed. I\
  \ would spend the next few afternoons with them, but the mornings were all mine\
  \ to do as I wished. It seemed a compromise of sorts. \n\nThe hotel was next to\
  \ a patisserie, so fantastic dreams of croissant and macaroons woke me early. It\
  \ seemed as though my room was located directly above the kitchen from the heavenly\
  \ smells that wafted in my window. \n\nEach morning I started with a pan au chocolate\
  \ so fresh the center was still molten. Next I nipped into the cafe next door for\
  \ shots of strong espresso that were unlike any coffee I had ever tasted. I suspect\
  \ the flavor was half excellent coffee, half anticipation. \n\nFueled by sugar and\
  \ espresso, I walked in whatever direction that called me. Tentative at first, I\
  \ stuck close to the hotel, then made forays into side streets that branched off\
  \ from the wonderfully named Avenue de la Grande-Armee.\n\nThe neighborhoods were\
  \ beautiful. The wedding cake buildings with their secret courtyards hidden behind\
  \ grand doors, the shops, the pocket parks that seemed to just appear; this was\
  \ the Paris I had longed for as a girl reading the Madeline books. \n\nAlongside\
  \ the restaurants (how many kebab shops are too many?), the flower shops, the small\
  \ grocers, I discovered some distinctly Parisian places. \n\nThere was the children\u2019\
  s clothing store that seemed completely disconnected from the reality of children.\
  \ Satin dresses, linen rompers, shoes that were never meant for puddles or playgrounds\
  \ were all displayed in the enticing shop window. \n\nStill another looked like\
  \ your basic pet store, save for the jewelry case that held an array of collars\
  \ for the most upscale poodle or posh shepherd. There were the strollers made for\
  \ dogs and the cat beds that made me decide that in my next life I wanted to be\
  \ a Parisian pet.\n\nEach street brought a new discovery and a newfound confidence\
  \ in myself. Those mornings were golden; I still see them with a golden glow when\
  \ I think of them. A halo that surrounds those memories of my first solo adventure.\n\
  \nI credit that \u2018problem\u2019 as the start of my love of travel. Since then\
  \ I have been to a dozen countries, most all of them as a solo traveler. That leap\
  \ of faith - ultimately in myself - brought me to a Paris beyond the museums and\
  \ monuments, and a love of travel that deepens with each new country I visit."
