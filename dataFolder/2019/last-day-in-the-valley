Text: "My stomach lurched as our bus shuddered, finally, to a halt. I\u2019d been\
  \ doing this for a month and still wasn\u2019t used to the precarious two hour journey\
  \ from Beirut to the Beqaa Valley that we took every morning to reach school in\
  \ Jib Jannine. I glanced at the clock on the windshield: 8:54. We were on time.\
  \  \nStepping off the bus, I marveled at the fertile valley, drenched in gold by\
  \ the morning sun. Rocky mountains stretched up into the clear blue Mediterranean\
  \ sky and formed a backdrop to the old paint factory that had been converted into\
  \ a school for Syrian refugees. \nI compelled myself to remember. It was, after\
  \ all, the last day of summer camp, which meant my job as a teacher \u2013 planning\
  \ and leading activities for a class of seven year-old\u2019s \u2013 was almost\
  \ over. \nBy afternoon, the sun would stretch high into the sky and cause radiating\
  \ waves of heat but for now, a gentle breeze tickled the back of my neck as I lugged\
  \ my canvas bag full of colored paper, stickers and glue inside for the last time,\
  \ joining the other volunteers as we headed to our classrooms.  \nI looked around\
  \ my class. On the first day, the room had felt cramped and bare simultaneously.\
  \ Large desks crowded near the whiteboard, surrounded by pale, stony walls. Now\
  \ though, the room exuded vitality, with projects plastered everywhere: mosaic flowers,\
  \ strings of paper lanterns, painted rainbows, a tree made out of tiny, green handprints,\
  \ hula-hoops, and scraps of colored paper scattered everywhere. \nThe artwork would\
  \ come down today as we cleaned and emptied our classrooms. I planned to give it\
  \ to the children to take home because I knew how excited they were to show their\
  \ families what they had made, but the thought of leaving the classroom empty made\
  \ my heart ache. \nRight now, with all its color and chaos, it was a reminder of\
  \ what the kids had created, of how they had blossomed and let me into their vibrant\
  \ worlds. Even the timidity of the more shy children \u2013 Faris, with his bright\
  \ green eyes, Mohammed, with his quick smile and Salma, who loved to dance \u2013\
  \ had evaporated, replaced by an eagerness to share everything, tugging at my sleeves,\
  \ whispering energetically to one another and being translated by my co-teacher,\
  \ Manal, who was also a Syrian refugee.   \nManal beamed when she entered the classroom\
  \ and saw me. She tugged her pale blue hijab to adjust it under her chin, then handed\
  \ me a steaming mug and pulled me into a hug. \n\u201CGood morning. How are you,\
  \ my dear?\u201D she asked, rummaging around her handbag for a Tupperware filled\
  \ with homemade date pastries and kaak \u2013 Syrian breadsticks coated in sesame\
  \ seats. \n\u201CI\u2019m good!\u201D I told her in Arabic. We tried to swap languages\
  \ as much as we could, to practice, often scribbling down new words in our notebooks,\
  \ committing them to memory. \u201CWa keef halik?\u201D And how are you? \nShe grinned\
  \ at my Arabic and handed me a crumbly pastry to dip into the sugary black tea.\
  \ It was still too hot to drink so I inhaled the sweet vapor. This was our routine.\n\
  \t\u201CI\u2019m sad that you are leaving\u2026 but,\u201D She said, brightening,\
  \ \u201CI made something special for lunch today.\u201D\n\t\u201CReally! What -?\u201D\
  \ \n\t\u201CIt\u2019s a surprise!\u201D She laughed. \u201CYou\u2019ll see.\u201D\
  \ \n\tManal did this often, invited me to eat lunch with her. She was an incredible\
  \ cook and made her own yogurts and breads that she brought in for sampling. I understood\
  \ why. She created a community in the teachers room, by spreading plates of labneh,\
  \ olives, kishik and other Syrian foods on the table, and bringing the teachers\
  \ together. Each added their own offerings: pita, hummus, chocolate buns and tea.\
  \ Always tea. \n\t I thought about the things I\u2019d read about Syrian refugees\
  \ before coming to Lebanon. They were often painted with broad strokes in Western\
  \ media as either threatening or suffering, or both. I knew that many of the people\
  \ here had lost everything when they left Syria. Sitting around the table that afternoon\
  \ though, in a room that was flooded with chatter and laughter and warmth, all I\
  \ could think of was resiliency."
