Text: "\"The art of making something out of nothing; the art of turning a few simple\
  \ ingredients into a feast, a few gathered friends into a festival.\" (L'arte d'arrangiarsi).\n\
  \nI travel for the love to see those unknown terrains, see distant lands and taste\
  \ different flavours. As Jan Myrdal puts it, \"There is a third dimension to traveling,\
  \ the longing for what is beyond.\" Bitten by the travel bug, whenever I have packed\
  \ my bags, I was always sure to explore, know and realise something new. I have\
  \ always have tried to adapt myself to the new landscape with every step, as I feel\
  \ that this is how you can receive more and return enlightened. Clearly, an ordinary\
  \ life has never interested me.\n\nAfter a few travel escapades, I realised that\
  \ travel tales are aptly spiced when explored with a bunch of strangers. Yes strangers!\
  \ People I have never met, never spoken!\nNever thought this stranger trip will\
  \ be my first international stranger's trip. \n\nSitting in the couch of airport\
  \ after the immigration, i was all set to fly Thailand. While boarding the flight\
  \ i met with several students alike me who were travelling for the same. It\u2019\
  s those human interactions that make travel experiences that little bit more special\
  \ and unique and so were they. Your travel experience,thus depends not only on the\
  \ place you go but also the people you meet, i already met with a bunch of people\
  \ in the airport itself. It was fun knowing each other.\n\n6:30am flight landed\
  \ at Bangkok. All alone in a new country with many people around made me feel this\
  \ as little risky. But the best rewards come from taking risks! and i believe that\
  \ unexpected journey forces you to put yourself out of your comfort zone and daily\
  \ mindset and i was ready to take up all. I always felt the urge to go out alone\
  \ because it would be some kind of milestone for me and here i was in the city of\
  \ liveliness called Bangkok.\n\n The absolute best way to dive into an adventure\
  \ is with people you've never met. Not only will you learn a lot about them, but\
  \ you'll learn a lot about yourself in the process. And isn't that what travel is\
  \ about?\n\nTravelling with strangers removes you from your comfort zone which I\
  \ feel everyone needs once in a while. For me I enjoy getting to know them and listening\
  \ to all the interesting ways of living, wherever they are from in this beautiful\
  \ world. The best part is making connections with all these free-spirited souls,\
  \ and someday later down the road reconnecting for another adventure, perhaps in\
  \ their own country or mine, to share lasting memories and create new ones.\n\n\
  The air had a rhythm to it as we laid in the sea of Pattaya in Thailand. Gently\
  \ buoyed by the earth beneath, our exposed skin were coated with water soft as silk,\
  \ and we watched trails of smoke dance, stirring sensually as they cooed from the\
  \ ends of idle cigarettes, writhing ever skyward, some joining another tributary\
  \ with a kiss, or else dispersing altogether with the wave of a hand. \n\n     \
  \     Thailand is a place of fearless action, vibrant surroundings and inescapable\
  \ beauty.\n\n          As the saying goes, experiences are much better when shared.\
  \ And in such short time, when being that many hours together and sharing that many\
  \ adventures, you can become really close. Often a group will bring out a specific\
  \ version of you & i found a new version of mine.\n\nI\u2019ve swam in a sea, visited\
  \ multiple places and learned a few words in Thai. It has only been only a week,\
  \ and visiting abroad has already satisfied my expectations.\n\nIt\u2019s those\
  \ human interactions that make travel experiences that little bit more special and\
  \ unique. Simultaneously with cultures, languages, you rediscover yourself as an\
  \ explorer, an art enthusiast, a Viking, a philosopher, a naughty boy. Your travel\
  \ experience, thus, depends not only on the place you go but also the people you\
  \ meet & i am really blessed to have these people as my travel buddy who added a\
  \ special essence of love and happiness to my journey."
