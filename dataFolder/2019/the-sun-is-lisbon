Text: "Lisbon spreads her arms \u2018till hugging the statute of Cristo Rei on the\
  \ opposite side of River Tejo. Lisbon is a huge hug herself: I say \u201Cher\u201D\
  \ because it\u2019s more than a city, I do feel it. \nPortugal\u2019s capital city\
  \ is located by the river; actually, this is just the final part, the mouth, the\
  \ outlet, and exactly here, is meeting and mixing with the Ocean, that\u2019s why\
  \ the water becomes salty. It owns sea, river, earth and sky;  Lisbon is the perfect\
  \ result, the combination of elements that make you feel alive.\n250 sunny days\
  \ per year, an everlasting summer\u2026the sun is so big, the daylight so strong\
  \ and powerful that you can even absorb it, therefore you get tanned so easily just\
  \ walking through the streets, and your hair can even become blonder while your\
  \ eyes must close a little bit. Call it magic. Lisbon is the city of sunsets, or\
  \ better of P\xF4res-do-sol. In Italian we are used to say: \u201CRosso di sera,\
  \ bel tempo si spera\u201D; when the sky turns red t the sunset, we may expect good\
  \ weather the next day. That happens here every day, or mostly. Everyone goes to\
  \ one of the hundreds Miradouros, seats down and breathes the end of the day. Lisbon\
  \ is a city to think, to meditate, to know better yourself first, and love more\
  \ the others then. \nThe city is so close to paradise, Portugal is Lisbon, white\
  \ city, pier and ship, Europe and Atlantic. From all this derives its hidden meaning:\
  \ the Saudade. Saudade is Lisbon\u2019s key word, ranked as the 7th most difficult\
  \ word to translate. Melancholic feeling of incompleteness, due to a previous pleasant\
  \ experience, state, or place, absent at the present moment. Saudade is what you\
  \ can feel while leaving Lisbon, she is able to give a real and natural sense of\
  \ place.\n\nIn Lisbon I\u2019ve learned to stop and relax, to come back late at\
  \ night but not so late, and before sleeping -in short pyjama even if it\u2019s\
  \ November- can\u2019t wait to stay staring in front of my window just to watch\
  \ the city sleeping and the planes landing. In Lisbon you can see airplanes all\
  \ day long, you hear their noise and notice them so close that scares. It seems\
  \ that everyone is coming there, everyone wants to reach this peace, and catch a\
  \ flight.\nI made a promise to myself here in Lisbon, where I spent 5 amazing months\
  \ of my life: I won\u2019t complain anymore as long as I can, because my life is\
  \ so wonderful and I\u2019ve definitely understood it. One more last detail: my\
  \ flatmate there used to call me -in Spanish- \u201Cterremoto\u201D that is \u201C\
  earthquake\u201D. Lisbon is the second city in Europe at higher seismic risk. I\u2019\
  ve been there and I want to come back so bad: \u201COnde a terra se acaba e o mar\
  \ come\xE7a\u201D (Lu\xEDs Vaz de Cam\xF5es), where the land finshes and the sea\
  \ begins."
