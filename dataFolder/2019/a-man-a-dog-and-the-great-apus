Text: "Hiking the legendary Ausangate mountain range in the remote Peruvian Andes\
  \ was an idea I had flirted with for some time. \nTravel agencies in Cusco didn't\
  \ offer any guided tours as it is quite challenging and not many people dare it\
  \ since it is not for the faint-hearted. \nRegardless of the lack of information,\
  \ I had a burning desire to explore this monument of natural power and breath-taking\
  \ beauty, and to prove to myself that I had the valor to accomplish such a formidable\
  \ task on my own. With only a simple map I downloaded online and some previous high\
  \ altitude hiking  experience from trekking the Salkantay mountain the previous\
  \ week, I loaded my bag pack with the bare essentials to survive for a week in the\
  \ remote snow covered Andes. This was going to be a real adventure and I had the\
  \ will and enthusiasm to accomplish it; even if the only assurance I had was an\
  \ honest trust in the courageous spirit that has always defined me.  \n   I took\
  \ the bus from Cusco to Tinki and by midday I was heading towards the unknown. Within\
  \ an hour of being on the trek, I came across a dog that was resting in front of\
  \ a humble school village. He gave a a strange look, stood up and started following\
  \ me. At one point he tripped me and made me fall to the floor. I though he was\
  \ laughing at me. I knew then I had made a new friend and what promised to be a\
  \ companion on this adventure. I thought his woolly fur would help me keep the tent\
  \ warm and endure the frigid night temperatures, as the sight of the ancient glaciers\
  \ and snow-covered peaks from the distance sent chills down my spine.   \nI named\
  \ my new friend Colmillo in tribute to his sharp fangs. \n   The first day we walked\
  \ until night fall, I set up camp on a mushy meadow and after dinner, half a can\
  \ of tuna with bread for me and an equal portion for my canine friend, we slipped\
  \ into oblivion. Through out the night Colmillo would go out of the tent barking\
  \ at some ghosts that only he could hear, but spirits or mountain lions, I felt\
  \ very safe now that I had found a chief security officer for the expedition. \n\
  \   The second was an overwhelming day, my eyes had never contained so much beauty\
  \ at once, in one place, in one day; the great Apus, the timeworn glaciers, the\
  \ colorful lakes, the earth, the sky, the blessing of being there, walking through\
  \ ancient valleys, guided by my instinct, carried by the winds. \nThe unknown aspects\
  \ of the adventure kept me walking enthusiastically. Nature untouched by the hand\
  \ of man, all of this contributes to give you a feeling that there must be something\
  \ greater than us, so much beauty can't simply be an accident.  \nIt was really\
  \ surprising to find nomadic Alpaca herders dwelling so remotely and in such simplicity,\
  \ disconnected from all modern day commodities.  \nNot having a GPS or cell phone\
  \ service was a really important part of this challenge for me. The Ausangate mountain\
  \ range requires that you are fully present, and without the aid of technology one\
  \ must learn to interpret the Sun's trajectory through out the sky to be certain\
  \ about the direction you must follow. \nWe hiked across deep fertile valleys and\
  \ over snow covered mountains, heading into the unknown. Confronted our deepest\
  \ fears, and together we shared this experience. I made a friend who was willing\
  \ to give up his life for me.\nWe spent the last night in Pacchanta, a little village\
  \ with hot springs at the foothills of the Ausangate peak. I parted with Colmillo\
  \ in Tinki, where I had found him and hoped to see him again one day. His eagerness\
  \ and my courage got us over the mountains; the journey became a test, the barriers\
  \ self-imposed, the believes crippling, the Sun and the gut as guides, the great\
  \ Apus as witnesses, the commitment to myself. \nSometimes to know we are alive,\
  \ we must be willing to sacrifice that which is most precious to us."
