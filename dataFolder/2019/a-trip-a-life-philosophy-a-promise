Text: "This isn\u2019t your typical love story...\n\nLately, it seems to have become\
  \ a trend to bury your inner child on social media. What happened? Friends, athletes,\
  \ and even our role models mention  uncontrollable circumstances. Sadly, we come\
  \ to the realization that our expectations were mere lies. By virtue of this, hope\
  \ is eradicated, and we abandon our most cherished dreams with our bare hands. But\
  \ I refuse to follow.\n\nIt all started in the Cape Town suburbs while on a trip\
  \ with a European companion. She was a modern international business lady with a\
  \ strong view of how we ought to act in this unsafe country. After all, she had\
  \ been working in Johannesburg for a few months already, and I had just flown into\
  \ the Republic. According to her, being outside during dusk is a high risk zone\
  \ and walking by foot makes you a very easy target. That is why she hit the panic\
  \ button when we missed the last bus to the city after a day of exploring and, thus,\
  \ started giving the cold shoulder. \n\nThen I noticed a tall, dark, athletic-looking\
  \ gentleman with a fellow active, casually-dressed lady come up to the bus stop\
  \ bench, protected from the UV rays by the tinned roof. Behind us was the beach\
  \ and an empty beautiful bay, as the crowd from less than an hour back had somehow\
  \ dispersed. The only other two people in the proximity of the bay sat on the red\
  \ bench to my left and looked down at their phones.\n\nMoments later, a car stopped\
  \ in front of us. The handsome young man turned to me and asked whether we also\
  \ needed to get to the city. My answer was yes, although I believe me eyes displayed\
  \ something else, and I tried to call over my travel companion. Of course, she ignored\
  \ me, as I uncomfortably asked the kind man to wait while I gather her. In the car,\
  \ I begged him to pardon my companion\u2019s French and then continued with our\
  \ philosophical discussion. In this short ride along the peninsula, we talked about\
  \ seals, dreams, and luck. Soon we parted, as my new friends were going to some\
  \ cafe/bar even though I anticipated they would have offered to join them. However,\
  \ my ever so-irritated and resentful companion seemed to have scared away any such\
  \ thought. \n\n\u201COh well\u201D, I said to myself and wished them a fun night\
  \ before catching the final bits of my final Capetonian sunset. I hoped my European\
  \ travel fellow would return to her senses and feel the beauty too. Surprise-surprise,\
  \ my thoughts returned to the \u201Cwhat if\u201D, and I calmed myself down thinking\
  \ it was meant to be this way. Besides, it was in South Africa that I started to\
  \ understand that the essence of life is not in the million of things we get done\
  \ each day. It is in living (actually living) by learning to enjoy every step of\
  \ life while not rushing though it. Alongside, a laugh is always not far way. It\
  \ does not take that much to have fun as we make it out to be. Things happen for\
  \ a reason. and sometime we will understand why, at least partially.\n\nSo with\
  \ this, I say thank you to that one person from Joburg who was visiting Cape Town\
  \ with his British friend. A paradox for me is that I can\u2019t remember his name,\
  \ but he has definitely spread some magic dust to my life philosophy, the foundation\
  \ of which is to always love your inner child, regardless of  what is thrown your\
  \ way. It comes to say, I will forever cherish and remember this moment. And today,\
  \ as I look at my diary from 2016, I understand the rooted meaning of that day\u2019\
  s entry: \u201CSomething has definitely changed after Africa... not sure what but\
  \ it feels surreal and I feel sth is very different.\u201D\n\nIndeed, this isn\u2019\
  t a typical love story... it is a love story about someone very special within your\
  \ being. My South African encounter allows me to say, first and foremost to myself,\
  \ to take time for my pure sheer joy little girl. I promise nothing will take you\
  \ away."
