Text: "The ancient, wine-producing region of Burgundy was not a holiday destination\
  \ where I expected to encounter a culture so alien and a language so specialised\
  \ that communication was necessarily reduced to poorly pronounced individual words\
  \ and hand gestures. My experience so far had affirmed my comfortable sense of familiarity:\
  \ in the appellations north of Beaune I had been accustomed to pay twenty odd euros\
  \ for a tour, in English, around the lucrative cellars of a commercial name, recognisable\
  \ from the shelves of any well-stocked supermarket at home. The easy form of tourism\
  \ this represents does not detract from the fact that the wine these businesses\
  \ produce is good, and the tours interesting. Moreover, they're responsible for\
  \ the prosperity of the region as a whole: they buy grapes and juice from smaller\
  \ wineries and ensure that production levels remain high enough to compete with\
  \ recent New World enterprises, which are threatening to overtake the two-millennia\
  \ old tradition of Burgundian viticulture.\n\nBut venturing down south, my companions\
  \ and I found ourselves in the less affluent C\xF4te Chalonaise and M\xE2connais\
  \ districts. Here, tiny villages lie unobtrusively tucked into the crevices of the\
  \ mountainous terroir, like limpets on a rock. Little more than a few kilometres\
  \ separates them from each other, yet they are almost invisible to one surveying\
  \ the landscape. Even the natural drama of the region\u2019s topography in subordinated\
  \ to the preeminent majesty of the vines. These stretch from the top of each hill\
  \ like a vegetative plague, flanking each road and preventing the villages from\
  \ bleeding together into larger urban settlements. \n\nThe attitude towards wine\
  \ here is balanced precariously between an invincible timelessness and a crippling\
  \ nostalgia. It\u2019s definitely not untouched by commercialism \u2013 since the\
  \ Roman occupation of Gaul, wine has been a major tradable commodity for these regions.\
  \ But it\u2019s not treated as a hedonistic indulgence, nor a high-profit luxury.\
  \ Grapes are the crop of a farming community, vines the family inheritance. \n\n\
  It was Jean Raquillet who precipitated this realisation in me. Armed with exceptionally\
  \ limited French, including only a couple of words from their immense vocabulary\
  \ pertaining to wine, we drew up boldly outside a promising sign in the Mercurey\
  \ appellation, emblazoned with both these terms: domaine and degustation. The member\
  \ of our party who was best linguistically equipt approached the rundown farmhouse\
  \ cowering behind its declarative sign. He returned a few moments later accompanied\
  \ by a man whose lack of youth was more than compensated for by his juvenile enthusiasm.\
  \ A huge scab dominated his forearm, and his nails were black with the same dirt\
  \ that was embedded in the creases of his palms. \n\nHe shook each of our hands\
  \ with his own, which were brown and leathery, tough as gardening gloves, and beamed\
  \ toothlessly at us. He gestured us over to the sign, which had first made us stop.\
  \ In English as appalling as our French he somehow managed to explain to us that\
  \ the first name on the plaque was that of his father\u2019s, the second his, and\
  \ the final that of his son, Fran\xE7ois, who now ran the Domaine. \n\nWhat then\
  \ proceeded was a series of convoluted directions. \u201CLeft,\u201D he said, throwing\
  \ out his bescabbed arm illustratively. Then he paused and corrected himself. \u201C\
  Lift.\u201D \n\n\u201CGauche,\u201D one of my companions offered helpfully. Jean\
  \ ignored him, continuing to alternate between left and lift until some indiscernible\
  \ emendation satisfied him that he had got the correct pronunciation. \n\n\u201C\
  There,\u201D he announced proudly, his eyes widening in a manner which was both\
  \ endearingly childlike and slightly manic, \u201Cthere you taste my wine.\u201D\
  \ \n\nOccasionally I come across Raquillet wine in England: a single representative\
  \ of the domaine tucked away at the end of a display rack of a Borough Market bar,\
  \ or gracing a bottom shelf in Fortnum and Mason\u2019s foodhall. It\u2019s curious\
  \ to see it so isolated from the context I originally encountered it in. Here its\
  \ unremarkable, overwhelmed by the variety that surrounds it, so unlike when I first\
  \ tasted the rust-red Pinot Noir in tiny cave not long after meeting Jean. As you\
  \ take the first sip the flavour remains poised, with a rustic integrity that I\
  \ now recognise as the product of three generations of vinicultural devotion."
