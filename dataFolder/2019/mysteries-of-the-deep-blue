Text: "Blue water rushes towards my bare toes stuck in sand, I stand admiring the\
  \ beauty of the scenery around me and I feels at peace, and adventurous at the same\
  \ time. I had just saved up enough for my first vacation from work decided to travel\
  \ to the one place I had always wanted to see in person. I feel amazed at the scene\
  \ before me, the ocean waves rushing toward me, the beautiful blue water surrounding\
  \ my feet and bottom legs becoming completely submerged. The sun high in the sky\
  \ and the air so soft as it lightly hits my bare skin, the weather in Florida being\
  \ beautiful as expected. I admire everything beautiful around me including the forest\
  \ of tall palm trees and the long sandy shore the reaches for miles going on both\
  \ sides of me. I am isolated from society hidden from prying eyes just the way I\
  \ like it. I step back and begin walking to my bag full of stuff, I shift and begin\
  \ to strip of my bikini covering my bare body, and lay them softly in the bag. I\
  \ stand and turn suddenly back toward the big blue beautiful ocean before me and\
  \ begin to rush as quickly as I can in a walking pace until my body is emerged to\
  \ my bare chest in the ocean.\n     The ocean surrounds me swaying from side to\
  \ side gently as the waves fall and rush towards me quickly. I feel the adrenaline\
  \ rushing through me like the waves as I fully submerged myself below, I swim right\
  \ under the water tow, admiring the magnificent new world below. In front of me\
  \ is a colorful reef full of all different kinds of colorful coral and fish living\
  \ routine lives in peace. I glide gently towards the reef being careful to not disturb\
  \ the beauty of life, I swim around and pick up some shells and admire the creatures\
  \ before me. I slide further behind the reef and halt in my movement when I spot\
  \ an amazing creature, something I had only ever seen on tv or the internet but\
  \ never expected to see in person. A strong orange colored Octopus the size of an\
  \ adult cat, walking calmly around the reef towards me, as if the Octopus suddenly\
  \ notices my company flattens against the reef and instantly changes color. As if\
  \ suddenly more curious than cautious I moves forward and slowly comes to a stop\
  \ not to close to the stiffened creature. I suddenly needing a breath of air swim\
  \ to the surface and grab another breath before swimming back down toward the timid\
  \ creatures. I move to the same spot and watch as the now relaxed octopus becomes\
  \ just as curious to the creature in front of him. I consider trying to reach out\
  \ to him to let him investigate more closely, but just as I move forward he moves\
  \ toward me causing my movements to freeze. Me and the curious Octopus seem to move\
  \ closer and closer together until finally my hand out in front of me is reaching\
  \ out to the Octopus. The Octopus takes sudden interest and reaches out and grasp\
  \ onto as if testing the water. Suddenly before I can move away to swim to the surface\
  \ to grab another breath, the curious Octopus has moved from the reef to my arm\
  \ and continues to climb my entire frame down and around toward the back of my thigh.\
  \ I have no choice but to move to the surface, the curious beauty hanging on for\
  \ the ride. Me and the beauty spend a good two hours swimming together gaining trust\
  \ from one another. I can't help but find that sometimes life can surprise you with\
  \ amazing things. Life itself is beautiful and curious. In this moment I find that\
  \ I can\u2019t get enough of amazing moments like this. Eventually my trip comes\
  \ to an end and I end up looking for a different job that will allow me to travel\
  \ and experience amazing things. I eventually quit my job finding the perfect opportunity\
  \ and begin my new life doing amazing adventures."
