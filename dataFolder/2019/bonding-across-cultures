Text: "Growing up, everything was always handed to me. My family was upper middle\
  \ class in Vancouver, Canada, and I was the sheltered baby of the family. But deep\
  \ down, I had a yearning for something more, for a sense of connection.  \n\nAt\
  \ the first chance to travel on my own, I took a leap of faith, left my job and\
  \ attended artist residencies across Europe. I was so excited to go, not only to\
  \ meet people, but to meet myself and see who was hiding beneath my surface. \n\n\
  I traveled throughout Bulgaria, Germany, Sweden, and Finland, relishing in all the\
  \ new relationships I made with artists, learning languages and other cultures.\
  \ Some I had a kinship with immediately, others I did not. But I took it all in\
  \ stride. \n\nAfter the alcohol-fueled gluttonous night of 2017 dissipated into\
  \ 2018, I realized I didn\u2019t have my next travel destination set up. I hadn\u2019\
  t heard back from any of the applications I sent out. Vancouver hovered in the back\
  \ of my mind but I wasn\u2019t ready to go home yet. Panic started to set in. Thankfully,\
  \ I had a free place to stay in Sweden with an artist I had just met while I made\
  \ my decision. It was a couple of days into the new year when an idea struck me.\
  \ A month earlier, a Dutch artist had mentioned I could ask to do an internship\
  \ in \xD3lafsfj\xF6r\u0111ur, Iceland if money was tight. That would mean a free\
  \ place to stay, and all I'd need to do was help other artists set up their exhibitions\
  \ for the Skammdegi Festival. \n\nThe idea lit something within me; it just felt\
  \ right. With bated breath, I sent an email to the artistic director in Iceland.\
  \ I didn\u2019t expect anything to come of it, only that if I could head to Iceland,\
  \ it would lengthen my trip across Europe just a tad longer. \n\nThe artistic director\
  \ responded in 24 hours with a request to chat via Skype. We spoke for 20 minutes\
  \ before she mentioned she only accepted artists who had been to her residency previously.\
  \ But since her current intern had to leave in a couple of weeks due to a visa issue,\
  \ she needed someone immediately. My entire being was on fire at the thought of\
  \ exploring a country that was so unique and steeped in traditions. I agreed to\
  \ the director\u2019s terms and cobbled what money I had to buy a one-way ticket\
  \ from Sweden to Iceland. In the dead of winter. \n\nThe cold barren land of this\
  \ tiny European island makes it hard for anyone to grow produce. The elements were\
  \ extreme \u2014 biting winds, ice-covered earth, high tidal waves crashing along\
  \ the beach \u2014 Iceland was not for the faint-hearted. \n\nWhen I first arrived,\
  \ it was a matter of figuring out how much money I could spend per meal. I had to\
  \ refrain from lavish produce purchases such as peppers, broccoli, oranges, and\
  \ especially meat. Even when I was being cautious with my food choices, my grocery\
  \ bill was still too high. To save money, I suggested to the other artists that\
  \ we hold communal dinners. We could hold potlucks, inviting other artists and villagers\
  \ to join us in building a tighter community. When I spoke to the artists and villagers\
  \ about it, everyone jumped at the chance to connect. \n\nOver the next few months,\
  \ we would sit around the immense living room, the table laden with lasagna, salad,\
  \ and potatoes, pizza nights (where I would make the dough and sauce while others\
  \ brought toppings), or tender lamb shanks where we all drank from a silver Icelandic\
  \ traditional cup of whisky to share in the prosperity. \n\nLaughter and conversations\
  \ rang in my ears as I looked around the table every night: villagers mixing with\
  \ artists, new residents being welcomed by long-term residents, introducing people\
  \ to different dishes. It\u2019s a sight I hold close to my heart, one I'll continue\
  \ to search for anywhere I travel."
