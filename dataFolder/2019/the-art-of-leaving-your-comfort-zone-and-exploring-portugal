Text: "Our generation is obsessed with the idea of traveling. We work all year to\
  \ take a two week vacation only to have trip advisor and other websites tell us\
  \ exactly what we should do. This travel story will be completely different because\
  \ it will be based on my Portugal experience but have the broader perspective of\
  \ how to dive into the moment while traveling. This will be an article you can read\
  \ before you embark on any journey you'll be taking this year, and one that will\
  \ especially excite those going to Portugal. \n\nMy travel story will be a budget\
  \ trip. There is more humor in this experience and more opportunities to leave your\
  \ comfort zone. I would like to arrange to stay with a family or a hostel to meet\
  \ people and get more local information. As for the rest of my story, I can't give\
  \ it to you and I honestly don't think I would want to read any travel story from\
  \ someone who could tell me exactly what they were going to write about before they\
  \ even arrived to the country. Travel is about living in the moment and connecting\
  \ to the people around you. \n\nThis travel story is going to highlight how to combine\
  \ creating a loose itinerary of the main things someone would like to see and allowing\
  \ spontaneity into the plan. Saying yes to opportunities on vacation has put me\
  \ in some incredibly funny, uncomfortable and outright dangerous situations but\
  \ knowing what I know now, I am so glad I said yes. As amazing as some of the most\
  \ popular tourists sights in the world are, it is always the unexpected that someone\
  \ remembers most. My fondest memory from Paris wasn't seeing the Eiffel tower but\
  \ going to bar hop small cafes with a hotel employee I befriended. In Zanzibar the\
  \ white sand beaches came secondary to breaking fast with a local family during\
  \ Ramadan. \n\nI am used to traveling alone. I am used to asking for help and finding\
  \ my way. I am really good at getting a feel for the local culture and navigating\
  \ the world as it comes. I want to write this travel story because it has been sitting\
  \ in the back of my mind during every trip I've taken the past two years. I think\
  \ it is relatable and important and entertaining content for this generation of\
  \ travelers to read. The people who have made the destination what it is more often\
  \ than not determine the trip."
