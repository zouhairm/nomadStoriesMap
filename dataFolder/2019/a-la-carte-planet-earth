Text: 'Vroom...overnight stranger.  What do you do when the adventure call knocks
  on you''re door and beckons you into the unknown. To all my nomadic travellers top
  on you''re bucket list should be the country named "A thousand hills" Rwanda is
  more than mountain gorillas and image of the "Switzerland of Africa" ecogreen country
  ,calm and slow non frenzy culture. Watching the light play games and absorbing the
  changes in the sky as the day  progressed is a sight to behold. Sink or swim into
  the adventure call in Musanze,the jumping off point for Volcanoes National Park
  and Rwanda''s gorilla treks and step into the twin lakes {Lake Burera & Lake Ruhondo}
  ,the nearby volcanoes ,and a scattering of  local town and villages. Take on Mount
  Muhabura ,the extinct volcano)P.S:the word Muhabura means the guide in kinyrandwarana,the
  local dialect in Rwanda) . And like the true world explorers flourish for a moment
  with the heaven on earth feeling. Seep  in the river of quiet tranquillity of peaceful
  escapade ennui of twilight zone ,momentarily tumbling into a power liberty of stature.
  Migrating  riches of family history of centuries like man has done.

  And after 2 weeks of the family holiday trip, we toasted good bye to the gem but
  not the memories.'
