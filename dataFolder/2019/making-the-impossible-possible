Text: "Moving to Portland, Oregon with my [then] boyfriend was the next phase in my\
  \ life as a 28 year old, or so I thought until my heart soon became broken. I knew\
  \ I needed a change in my life and Portland was supposed to be that change. I was\
  \ now 28 years old, single, living at home, feeling stuck in the job I've had for\
  \ the past five years with no more Oregon in sight. What was I supposed to do now?\
  \ Where was I supposed to go? These questions constantly crossed my mind as I woke\
  \ up everyday, went to my job, worked out [to keep my only known sanity I had],\
  \ came home to my parents, to do it all again day after day, week after week. That\
  \ was until one night when I was sitting in my bed with my laptop, browsing the\
  \ internet, remembering that one website I came across, about traveling with a group\
  \ of nomads while working remotely. After quickly directing my attention to their\
  \ website and Instagram page, I knew I needed to see what this \"nomad\" experience\
  \ was all about. What was even a \"nomad\" I thought to myself? I came across beautiful\
  \ and mesmerizing pictures of groups of people smiling in the sandy deserts of Morocco\
  \ on Christmas Day, surfing the waves in Florianopolis, Brazil and strolling the\
  \ streets of Split, Croatia all while being able to continue their jobs as long\
  \ as they had a laptop and WIFI. This was a group I wanted to be a part of and this\
  \ was going to be the next phase of my life. Bye Portland, hello world. But, how\
  \ do I actually make this dream become my reality?\n\nI brought this [little] idea\
  \ to my friends, family and co-workers asking what they thought about it. Do they\
  \ think my employer would allow me to work remotely? Could I afford the program\
  \ costs? Could I actually work remotely in my current position and be successful?\
  \ And to no surprise, they all thought I was crazy. And at that moment, I knew I\
  \ needed to prove everyone wrong. I would spend my nights researching how to write\
  \ a proposal, developing ideas for the reasons why they should let me do this, listening\
  \ to our CEO speak at our town halls to place direct quotes in my proposal. I applied\
  \ for the company I would be traveling with and after numerous interviews [to see\
  \ if I was a good fit] I was accepted into the program. I needed a change and this\
  \ was going to be my change.\n\nWith my acceptance to join the program under my\
  \ belt, the last step was the proposal and acceptance from manager. After 3 weeks\
  \ of multiple revisions and editing, I was confident that the final proposal I had\
  \ written was the best I could have done. I was ready to meet with my manager and\
  \ hand in those two pages that could potentially [and hopefully] change my life.\
  \ \n\nWeeks went by after the meeting with my manager, with no word from her, which\
  \ was not a very good sign for me. Is she going to say yes? Should I forget this\
  \ all together? No. I have worked way too hard and put in too much effort to just\
  \ let this go and give up this easy. After sweating for about an hour at my desk,\
  \ building up my courage, I decided to walk into my managers office and ask her\
  \ blatantly whether she accepts my proposal or not. To my surprise, the answer was\
  \ YES! Did I just pull that off?! Was I really going to be able to travel while\
  \ working remotely with these \"nomads\" I saw on social media?! Was I now going\
  \ to be a smiling face in those pictures?! I really was. On December 30th, 2017,\
  \ I left Boston Logan International airport, destination Santiago, Chile for a once\
  \ in a lifetime opportunity that did not disappoint."
