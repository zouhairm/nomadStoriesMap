Text: "It\u2019s late February in Menton, France. We stand in a garden, twelve euros\
  \ the entry, sheltered by solid barriers and security guards. \u201CCircle of Life\u201D\
  \ plays faintly on crackling speakers. A Mediterranean breeze carries the delicate\
  \ scent of oranges.\n\nStairs lead up to a tall platform that offers an uninterrupted\
  \ view of a lion made from citrus fruits. Hordes of elderly people play paparazzi\
  \ at the top.\nThis is La F\xEAte du Citron, a Mentonnais tradition dating back\
  \ to 1934. This is also our vacation. \n\nBoth my mother and I are younger than\
  \ the majority of the crowd by a good twenty-five years. I am not\u2013in the view\
  \ of the French retrait\xE9s eyeing me\u2013dressed for the weather. It\u2019s a\
  \ bright 63-degree day, but in showing my shoulders in February I\u2019ve committed\
  \ a clear faux-pas. Stopping to pose for a picture in front of a house made of oranges,\
  \ I overhear muttered comments about how \u201Cla pauvre\u201D needs to put on a\
  \ coat.\n\nThe trip was not unfolding quite like I\u2019d imagined. \n\nWhen I learned\
  \ my mom wanted to visit me during my stint teaching in France, I seized the opportunity.\
  \ Two weeks. One credit card. France was our oyster. I wanted to show Mom where\
  \ I\u2019d been living in the Auvergne, but limited transportation options made\
  \ it impractical. Instead, I scoured the Internet for something new. It had been\
  \ a dreary winter. I dreamt of color and sun. \n\nMy search led me to Menton, which\
  \ looked like a pastel paradise, all sherbet-colored slanting apartments and long\
  \ stretches of beach abutting the turquoise sea. I learned that a well-known event\
  \ was coming up: the annual festival highlighting the town\u2019s most celebrated\
  \ product, a particular variety of lemon. Lemons from Menton are sweet and delicate\
  \ in flavor, big as grapefruits. Pausing on the train ticket website, I pictured\
  \ a thriving seaside village. Markets, gardens, and sunshine. All of it enhanced\
  \ by a quirky, lemon-scented festival. Sold.\n\nIn reality, it\_was\_all of these\
  \ things. But the full experience cannot be accurately communicated in the language\
  \ of a tourism brochure.\nOn our second day in Menton, as we beheld the heart of\
  \ the festival\u2013no more than a rectangular garden filled with revolving citrus\
  \ sculptures, tinny Broadway music in the air\u2013I had little to say. Oh. \n\n\
  Call it shame. The pride before the fall. I was remembering each time I had mentioned\
  \ to a friend or colleague how thrilled I was for les vacances. How my mom was visiting\u2013\
  all the way from the United States. How we had planned a trip to the South of France\
  \ for the express purpose of attending La F\xEAte du Citron. My current raison d\u2019\
  \xEAtre, or so I myself had confidently expounded, was a garden of citrus-studded\
  \ Broadway paraphernalia. \n\nMom and I watched an empty-eyed, grinning Mary Poppins\
  \ revolve on her platform.\n\n\u201CMom,\u201D\_I gasped with laughter.\_\u201C\
  I told people we were coming here. For this.\u201D\n\nI hadn\u2019t misinterpreted\
  \ the surprise of our AirBnb host. We\u2019re here for the F\xEAte du Citron! I\
  \ had said breezily. As if it was not at all strange. As if my mother had not flown\
  \ thousands of miles to gaze at a tribute to Singin\u2019 in the Rain made of lemons\
  \ and plastic. I had the strange feeling of having aged too quickly (say,\_fifty\
  \ years) in a day.\n\n\u201CWow, Jess,\u201D\_Mom said as we looked up at a citric\
  \ Moulin Rouge. \u201CIt\u2019s everything I\_dreamed it would be.\u201D\n\nThe\
  \ jibe was not lost on me. \u201CYeah, well. It\u2019s worse for you. At least I\
  \ live here. You flew from the middle of the United States for this.\u201D\n\nSnapping\
  \ a few pictures, I realized that if I avoided the army of tourists aiming iPhones,\
  \ the sculptures did look kind of\u2026cool. I could use these photos. But I accepted,\
  \ grudgingly, that I couldn\u2019t stop there. I had to tell the whole story. That\
  \ while Menton lemons make some good lemonade, the festival is no NOLA Mardi Gras.\
  \ \n\nOn the train, later, I heard some ladies chatting and translated for Mom:\
  \ \u201Cthe f\xEAte was\_especially\_good\_this year, don't you think?\u201D"
