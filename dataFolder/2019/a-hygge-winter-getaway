Text: "After a very stressful couple of months I decided that it was time to feed\
  \ my Wanderlust and pick a random destination and just go. My favourite travel buddy\
  \ was onboard, as always, so after some quick research we got ourselves \xA316 return\
  \ flight tickets to Copenhagen from London. \nVisiting Denmark during the winter\
  \ is probably not the smartest decision due to the harsh weather. However, being\
  \ there at the beginning of December, when everyone is excited for Christmas and\
  \ there are countless small Christmas Markets scattered around the city, left us\
  \ feeling that we've chosen one of the best destinations for our trip.\nWhat made\
  \ an impression on me was that the Danish weren't bothered with the tourists at\
  \ all...in a good way. From my experience, whenever I've been to a capital city,\
  \ there are countless shops and tourist attractions everywhere. But Copenhagen was\
  \ different. We got lost more than once trying to find the statue of the Little\
  \ Mermaid and when we got there, there were no souvenir shops, no one trying to\
  \ sell you a picture of you with her - nothing - and it was refreshing. Later on\
  \ we were approached in a cafe by a lovely lady and her teenage daughter who were\
  \ wondering where our accent was from. They explained to us that whenever the Danes\
  \ travel abroad they never tend to buy souvenirs so that's why they just don't bother\
  \ with having too many around in Copenhagen. Simple as that.\nCopenhagen is a multicultural\
  \ city. In the four days we spent there, we: stayed with a Czech university student,\
  \ went to an international Christmas dinner at a Danish language centre, met up\
  \ with a good friend from my home country (Bulgaria), strolled down the streets\
  \ of Copenhagen with an Aussie who studies in the UK and lives in Copenhagen, and\
  \ tried mulled wine at a German Weihnachtsmarkt.\nWe were lucky to experience what\
  \ the Danish call \"hygge\" - the appreciative way of creating a warm atmosphere\
  \ and enjoying the good things in life with good people."
