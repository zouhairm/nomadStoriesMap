Text: "My host family picked me and a friend up from the airport at night and there\
  \ were no street lights. As we drove further into town, I could see the fales, houses\
  \ made of wood with no walls. There were families watching television, talking,\
  \ or sleeping. When we arrived to the host house, it was elevated with walls. I\
  \ was exhausted and when the door opened, there were other family members there\
  \ to greet us. There was a family of geckos on the wall making the occasional noise,\
  \ which I guessed translated to welcome to our home. We were terrified and began\
  \ to wonder how we would be able to rest with these reptiles that everyone told\
  \ us were good luck. Eventually, we learned to cohabitate. \n\nIt is hard to get\
  \ a feel of your surroundings when you arrive at night. The next morning, I first\
  \ woke up to the extreme humidity and sounds of the jungle, which were mostly insects\
  \ and wild dogs. When our gracious host drove us around the island I saw the beauty\
  \ of the Pacific like I had never seen before. The horizon curved like I was on\
  \ the last island on Earth. Everything was so luscious with vibrant hues of green\
  \ and tropical flowers that adorned the ground and trees. Apia, on the island of\
  \ Upolu is less than 1,000 miles south of the Equator, brings a heat unimaginable.\
  \ The sun tap dances on your skin and sweat constantly oozes through your pores\
  \ like condensation on a glass\u2026you never feel dry. We stopped on the side of\
  \ the road and watched a young boy chop a fresh young coconut with a machete. I\
  \ had coconut water plenty of times but never this fresh and when I was truly thirsty,\
  \ I came to the conclusion that it really is nature\u2019s goodness. \n\nMy time\
  \ on the island was indeed magical. I met people that could not believe that two\
  \ Americans decided to travel such a long way to visit their island. We were fortunate\
  \ to be welcomed with a special \u2018Ava (kava) ceremony that involves a ritual\
  \ with speeches and drinking a root beverage. Our host provided us etiquette tips\
  \ beforehand. The ceremony allowed us to bond with those present and we had friends\
  \ on the island throughout the rest of the trip. I was overwhelmed by the generosity\
  \ of the Samoans. Almost everyone we encountered asked if we had visited Savai\u2019\
  I, Samoa\u2019s largest island, that was only a ferry ride away. On the day before\
  \ the last night in Apia, I asked my friend if she wanted to spend our remaining\
  \ night on the other island. She was very hesitant because the other island was\
  \ less developed than Upolu and we would have to stay in a fale. In that moment,\
  \ I felt like Sean Astin in Goonies and asked her, \u201CWhen are you realistically\
  \ going to have the opportunity to stay in structure right on the beach?\u201D I\
  \ gave her a heartfelt speech that this was our chance to explore a place many of\
  \ our friends would never venture. \n\nWe hopped on the ferry the next morning;\
  \ a taxi driver to take us sightseeing among the lava fields and turtle ponds and\
  \ lodging for the night. The water was an opaque turquoise and shallow for yards.\
  \ The sand was like powder and the fale was set up with mattresses and mosquito\
  \ nets by the family that owned the land. We were feet away from the ocean and got\
  \ to go on meditation walks and be at one with nature. At night all the guests gathered\
  \ in the center area and at the meal, which consisted of fish prepared in banana\
  \ leaves, greens cooked with coconut milk, and breadfruit. The children in the family\
  \ played instruments and sang while we communed with guests from New Zealand and\
  \ the Netherlands that were on holiday. We woke the next morning to a beautiful\
  \ sunrise and an inner peace. I was grateful to have the experience of meeting enriched\
  \ people, learning about the Samoan culture, and having moments to become more grounded."
