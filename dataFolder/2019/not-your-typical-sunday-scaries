Text: "The day before my 23rd birthday I was in the backseat of a black Nissan Sentra,\
  \ both hands clasped over my stomach. I was already feeling uneasy from my extreme\
  \ hangover and driving along the empty Guadalajaran backstreets with a stranger\
  \ was not helping.\n\nHalf an hour into our trip and my mid-30 year-old Uber driver\
  \ was still amused by my situation. Instead of judging me for my night out he seemed\
  \ to sympathize, probably knowing all too well how easily it is to get wrapped up\
  \ in the buzz of the Chapultepec bar scene. I had missed my 8AM bus back to Aguascalientes,\
  \ had no cell phone, and was letting a stranger take me to meet another stranger.\n\
  \nWe were approaching a corner now under a dark blue bridge: the designated meeting\
  \ spot. The Guadalajaran streets were asleep on this Sunday morning: businesses\
  \ had their rusty accordion doors closed up, families were in the middle of morning\
  \ mass, and there was no hope of seeing the rest of the population who had probably\
  \ just gotten into bed a couple of hours ago. My Uber driver pulled over and we\
  \ surveyed the barren dirt street. I knew we had the wrong location and felt woozy\
  \ at the thought of formulating a new plan. I hitched my backpack on and reached\
  \ for the door handle, not ready to step into this unknown.\n\n\u201CI don\u2019\
  t think this is a good idea,\u201D my Uber driver quipped turning around to face\
  \ me. He motioned for the torn sheet of notebook paper in my hand and dialed the\
  \ phone number scribbled on it.\n\n\u201CHola! Where are you? I\u2019m with the\
  \ girl who\u2019s looking for her phone.\u201D A few seconds of silence, a nod or\
  \ two, and then we were off. \n\n\u201CWe\u2019re super close!. He gave you the\
  \ name of this store but it\u2019s a chain, we just had the wrong one.\u201D he\
  \ said shaking his head as if he could have premeditated this mistake. \n\n\u201C\
  So...you\u2019re going to take me to him?\u201D I asked unsure.\n\n\u201COf course,\u201D\
  \ he responded fervently.\n\nAs we approached another dark blue bridge, we saw a\
  \ young man leaning against his brown car: last night\u2019s Uber driver. The exchange\
  \ was a over in seconds. I ran up to him and he immediately placed the phone in\
  \ my hand. There wasn\u2019t much to say and he probably wanted to permanently do\
  \ away with the girl who had been calling him since 7 AM. I could see today\u2019\
  s Uber driver shaking with laughter at the awkward exchange as a I jogged back triumphant.\n\
  \n\u201CHey, instead of calling another Uber, do you think you can just drive me\
  \ to the bus station?\u201D \n\nHe hurriedly motioned for me to get into the car.\
  \ His mission to make sure I got to my final destination went without saying. \n\
  \nIn Guadalajara traffic, even on sleepier Sundays, the drive from Zapopan all the\
  \ way across town to the main bus station in Tlaquepaque easily takes an hour. My\
  \ Uber driver was hungry and asked to stop at Subway. I stayed in the car firing\
  \ off some quick messages insisting I wasn\u2019t hungry. When he returned he handed\
  \ me a cookie.\n\nOn our final stretch of the ride, he asked the question I had\
  \ been for: \n\u201CSo, what has been your favorite part of Mexico?\u201D\n\n\u201C\
  The people,\u201D I answered without hesitation. This is always my answer, but this\
  \ time I meant it.\n\nYou could have left me on that random street and I\u2019d\
  \ probably still be frozen to the spot crying. But you didn\u2019t leave me. I\u2019\
  m even sitting here eating a damn cookie.\n\n\u201CI\u2019ve never experienced kindness\
  \ like I have in Mexico.\u201D My Uber driver smiled, content with my answer, as\
  \ we made our final turn into the bus station. \n\nAs his car pulled away I knew\
  \ there was no real way for me to thank him. The best I could do was text my friend:\n\
  Made it to the bus station. The Uber trip is going to come out a bit expensive on\
  \ your account. Will pay you back ASAP and I\u2019ll explain later. Please give\
  \ him a \u201CHero\u201D rating!!!"
