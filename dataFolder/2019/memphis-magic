Text: "Stepping off the bus in Memphis I was filled with an electric anxiety, I had\
  \ arrived in a city which held within it my broken heart and so much history that\
  \ I was excited to explore. Immediately I was struck by one of the wonders of travelling\
  \ by bus in America, the bus station was about as far away from the city as it could\
  \ be whilst still being called \u201CMemphis bus station\u201D. A not-so-short drive\
  \ later, I arrived at my hotel, and boy did it disappoint: the sheets were crusty,\
  \ there were bugs in the shower and the TV seemed to have the same age as my parents.\
  \ This was the third city along my Southern US tour, after Houston and New Orleans,\
  \ both of which had surpassed my expectations, but I knew in these moments that\
  \ Memphis was different. Feeling the creeping sense of dread that comes with the\
  \ fear of seeing one\u2019s ex-partner, I sought out a comforting classic American\
  \ diner: nothing of the diverse culinary experiences I had painfully sought out\
  \ in the last two cities. \n\nThe neon lights of the diner did nothing to brighten\
  \ my mood and the d\xE9cor was nothing but a blur as I walked towards the waitress.\
  \ Sat at the bar, I fixed my eyes firmly on the time-tested menu, raising my head\
  \ only to give my order before plunging back down, this time into a book. \u201C\
  Hey\u201D the girl next to me said, \u201CI like your accent, where are you from\u201D\
  . She was plagued by the classic American inability to distinguish between any other\
  \ anglophone accents, and so we began to converse around my British accent. As someone\
  \ who had travelled herself, Carly was accustomed to the solitude that I was experiencing\
  \ and although she didn\u2019t know the extent of my personal woes her empathy was\
  \ comforting. Carly was travelling with her father and we all talked for about half\
  \ an hour, already I was beginning to feel more at ease \u2013 this was just another\
  \ example of southern hospitality that I had been fortunate enough to experience.\
  \ A simple conversation is something which I must have had a million times in my\
  \ life, and I am not sure there one more memorable. At the end, I was laughing and\
  \ smiling like when I was a child, and Carly\u2019s father offered me to come and\
  \ visit them in Florida. Logistically, it was impossible, as I was travelling to\
  \ the west, rather than the east. Then, my world was opened by the extraordinary\
  \ generosity of these two people. \n\nTwo days later. I am stood outside my hotel\
  \ in Atlanta, awaiting a ride from Carly\u2019s cousin, local to Atlanta. It was\
  \ the morning of his best friend\u2019s wedding, yet he still took the time out\
  \ to pick me up, stopping for a coffee and talk about life, before leaving me at\
  \ the airport. Yes. The airport. Carly and her father were flying me in their private\
  \ plane to the family home in Florida, an opportunity that I could not refuse. I\
  \ walked through the airport, which was smaller than most of the hostels that I\
  \ had stayed in throughout my travels, and onto the runway. I see a plane coming\
  \ into land and Jeff, Carly\u2019s cousin, indicates that they have arrived. The\
  \ navy-blue plane was topped with a bright Florida orange, but more surprising than\
  \ the colour choice was the size, being 2 meters tall meant that I stood literally\
  \ head and shoulders above the plane. The journey lasted little more than two hours,\
  \ finishing when we hit the postcard-worthy white sand beaches of Florida. The weekend\
  \ that followed was equally astonishing, experiencing the \u201Cdeep south\u201D\
  \ was equal parts terrifying and enthralling. I went fishing, jet skiing, met the\
  \ founder of the local republican party, the candidate for local mayor, and topped\
  \ it all off with a duet of Bonnie Tyler\u2019s \u201CTotal Eclipse of the Heart\u201D\
  \ at the towns Karaoke bar. \n\nThe positivity that now defines my travels is my\
  \ attempt to recreate the magic that this quite ridiculous story broughout into\
  \ my life."
