Text: "In the early morning mist, Cat Ba island seems to appear suddenly in the bay\
  \ and beckons all would be adventurers. Travelers are greeted by a vast, mountainous\
  \ landscape blanketed in cascades of vibrant green jungle. Half the island is home\
  \ to a national park laden with unique natural features, rambling motorbike paths,\
  \ and stunning biodiversity. Despite its notably overzealous point of entry, the\
  \ island itself is a respite from the din of its neighboring mainland cities. Most\
  \ islanders will offer you a friendly greeting in passing and are generally forgiving\
  \ of the inevitable language faux pas in conversation. Venturing beyond Cat Ba town\u2019\
  s disappointing eateries is a must to experience heavenly sauteed clams, king crab\
  \ rolls and other mouth-watering culinary traditions available at local spots. \n\
  \nI found myself on the island one gray March morning in an attempt to avoid the\
  \ throngs, higher costs (and possible sea sickness) which would have likely characterized\
  \ a visit to nearby Ha Long bay. My traveling companion and I originally checked\
  \ into a room on the waterfront at Cat Ba, which we eventually abandoned for a lovely\
  \ (and strangely empty) B&B run by a wonderful family on the edge of town. I was\
  \ anxious to go caving, but we spent our first day exploring the local market, planning\
  \ our outings for the next few days over dinner, and sporadically chatting with\
  \ our hosts with assistance from google translate. Sleep in our new surroundings\
  \ was quick and restful.\n\nThe following morning took us deep into the park along\
  \ long, winding roads. I thought less about getting to our destination as I enjoyed\
  \ the wind on my face and the towering jungle-clad peaks. After a few detours and\
  \ a roadside lunch, we arrived at our first cave, where we unwittingly surprised\
  \ a young German couple struggling to get their flashlights to work in the dark.\
  \ We invited them to join us on a candlelit walk through the passages. My companions\
  \ went on in conversation as we made our way through individual chambers, as well\
  \ as some questionable squeezes, but I was aware of falling silent as wonder sunk\
  \ in. The air was thin, musty and still, and sounds seemed muted upon reaching my\
  \ ears. Mineral formations reached for us from the cave floor and ceiling, except\
  \ in one cavern which was filled with bats. The darkness closed in all around us\
  \ and more than once I had to shake the irrational feeling that eyes were peering\
  \ out at us from the shadows.\n\nEmerging from the cave, our new friends asked us\
  \ to accompany them on another hike a few miles away. We revved up the bikes and\
  \ took off down the road, as rays of sunshine began to pierce through the clouds.\
  \ They turned off the road ahead of us onto a bumpy dirt bike path that weaved through\
  \ farmland. I found myself giggling with delight and disbelief as my companion followed\
  \ these strangers. He took every twist, sharp turn and bump, laughing along with\
  \ me. We all came to a stop at the bottom of a well-worn footpath which carved into\
  \ the hillside and disappeared over a pass. The climb was grueling, punctuated only\
  \ by pauses to avoid crossing snakes, observe hillside ramshackles and to greet\
  \ the odd bemused farmer (often carrying a load, yet breathing without effort).\n\
  \nOn reaching the top of the pass, wonder once again settled low in my belly at\
  \ the view. A lush, green valley extended beyond us, completely enclosed on all\
  \ sides by rugged, limestone peaks. The mossy floor of the valley split into plots,\
  \ farms and gardens, dotted with smaller shacks, wandering animals and walking trails.\
  \ Above us, the mist turned to rain, delivering moisture to the hungry soil below\
  \ and the life upon it. It was not a white-sand beach on a sunny day, nor a glittering\
  \ ancient city, but it was nature in all its glory, and as close to an isolated\
  \ oasis as I would ever recall from memory. Cat Ba island had lived up to its reputation\
  \ as a jewel of Lan Ha bay, at least in the eyes of a visitor who cared little for\
  \ the beaten path."
