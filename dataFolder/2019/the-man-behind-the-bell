Text: "He was late, but the bells were not: they shrilled incessantly through the\
  \ dawn, like they did every day.  As I shifted from one foot to the other, impatience\
  \ growing with every second, I realised that I took his presence for granted. \n\
  \nI had begun a new life in India\u2014a lonely, exhausting, and literally hungry\
  \ one\u2014leaving behind everything I knew as \u201Chome\u201D on the other side\
  \ of the world. And after several months there, the one friend I had made was Arjun,\
  \ a rickshawala who would wait outside every weekday to take me to an office. \n\
  \nExcept this day was different. When I left my apartment that morning, he wasn\u2019\
  t reclined in his bicycle across the dusty street. The minutes wasted away as I\
  \ idled outside the building, awkwardly glancing around for the familiar face atop\
  \ the familiar cycle rickshaw. When I couldn\u2019t wait any longer without my boss\
  \ calling to ask if I was going to be late again, I took off. I wasn\u2019t owed\
  \ an explanation, yet still I felt snubbed by Arjun\u2019s absence.\n\nAs I approached\
  \ the complex gate a sudden ringing made me forget my asthma, and I drew in a deep\
  \ breath of polluted air. But I knew, before turning around, that it wasn\u2019\
  t who I was expecting. Arjun\u2019s bell was a sweet little robin that chirped quietly\
  \ for my attention. This one produced a screechy peal that pecked at my every step.\
  \ \n\nI halted as the rickety rickshaw drew up beside me and looked up into an unfamiliar\
  \ face. He beckoned with his head expectantly, urging me to get on. Morosely, I\
  \ climbed aboard; each fare contributed significantly to Arjun\u2019s livelihood,\
  \ and this felt like a betrayal.\n\nThat one irregularity became the new schedule.\
  \ \n\nEvery day I stalled as long as I could, hoping to see Arjun sail around the\
  \ corner, gently chiming his bell in greeting. Sometimes I frowned at whichever\
  \ impostor stood in his usual spot. Eventually, though, I\u2019d always end up hitching\
  \ a ride with another rickshawala. \n\nOne day, as I was disembarking, I engaged\
  \ the driver in conversation to furtively find out about Arjun. He couldn\u2019\
  t\u2014or wouldn\u2019t\u2014speak English, so I tried in appallingly broken Hindi:\
  \ \u201CArjun kahaan hai? Any rickshawala?\u201D \n\nThe rickshawala looked me hard\
  \ in the eyes. Pocketing my payment, he shook his head very slightly, and then just\
  \ rode off. \n\nAs with all the comforting things that had vanished from my life,\
  \ I soon got used to it. Anything could have happened: Arjun\u2019s rickshaw may\
  \ have been confiscated by traffic police, perhaps there was a family emergency\
  \ back in his home state of Bihar, or maybe \u2026 I had to consider the other possibility.\n\
  \nI came to accept that it wouldn\u2019t be Arjun\u2019s scarlet rickshaw, a dilapidated\
  \ chariot, carrying me high above the daily chaos. \n\nIt wouldn\u2019t be his staccato\
  \ chuckle, bursting forth like wooden wind chimes, when I told him for the thirteenth\
  \ time that I wasn\u2019t enjoying my new job.\n\nIt wouldn\u2019t be his bloodshot\
  \ eyes, masked with cheerful stoicism, flickering between skittish mongrels and\
  \ careless pedestrians.\n\nIt wouldn\u2019t be his tired feet, cracked and infected\
  \ by the soiled streets of New Delhi, faithfully pedalling me to work.\n\nAnd it\
  \ wouldn\u2019t be his goodbye smile, burrowed under salt-and-pepper whiskers, encouraging\
  \ me to face another day with impassive colleagues.\n\nI never saw Arjun again,\
  \ and the day he disappeared marked the beginning of my unravelling. Two months\
  \ later I quit my job and, soon after, I quit India too\u2014waning health and spirit\
  \ in tow. It was good riddance to the roller-coaster bouts of food poisoning, the\
  \ lively illnesses that my body adopted, and the distant relatives who pawned me\
  \ off in old family feuds. \n\nBut I didn\u2019t get to say goodbye to the one constant\
  \ in my life there: the only stability in an unpredictable city, the only comrade\
  \ in a world full of hostility.\n\nI remember how, when I first arrived in India,\
  \ the jingles of the rickshaws had grated on my every nerve, and how quickly they\
  \ won me over when they introduced me to Arjun. \n\nSo I have hope, perhaps naively,\
  \ that the man behind the bell is still out there somewhere \u2026 alive and ringing."
