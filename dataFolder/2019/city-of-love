Text: "Mahatma Gandhi once said, \u2018Where there is love, there is life\u2019. Waiting\
  \ at the Lima airport, I had an intuition, as I felt excitement spread to my lips\
  \ and flood my body. A few days later I knew I would write about this city - of\
  \ love.\nAs you walk through narrow cobblestone streets, Palo Santo incense welcomes\
  \ you, color radiates joy in fabrics, to decorated llamas parading with women who\
  \ wear two long plaits and a small hat, cocoa melts in your mouth, and an unforgettable\
  \ changing atmosphere leaves you breathless and sun stroked. People dance and chant\
  \ on the streets celebrating Quechua culture. Ancient traditions are slowly erased\
  \ over the world, but we watched with admiration at the locals discovering theirs.\n\
  The story like others has a dark cloud of invasion, but for now, I want you to meet\
  \ me in the early of the morning, on a bus that bounces through the ink sky to the\
  \ Ancient Mountain. Clouds weave through mountains like smoke, greeting our little\
  \ bus across the green quilted landscape of corn crops. The earth is carved like\
  \ hands in a prayer, occasionally meeting houses of mud brick walls. \nWith a childlike\
  \ excitement, we disembark and embark on a train at Ollantaytambo station. I stand\
  \ in the open carriage and watch the train snake alongside the rapid currents of\
  \ the Urubamba River, meeting darkness in tunnels and people working with devotion\
  \ in the patches of corn. The palette is earthy and at times silvery and mystical,\
  \ with color scattered like light. People wave back to us as they become part of\
  \ the story and we become part of theirs. In a moment the train whistles stop, and\
  \ we continue on a bus through Machu Picchu Pueblo. We ride through sharp inclines\
  \ and rising mountains, and this time, I question myself and my fear of heights.\
  \ \nAt our destination we are welcomed by the grandeur expansive view indescribable\
  \ with words. We send each other high fives and begin our incline to Wayna Picchu,\
  \ also known as Huayna Picchu or Young Peak, which we learn from our guide, was\
  \ used by the disciples of the Inca empire to meditate themselves back to pure innocence.\
  \ We descend first into a lush wet ecosystem before we climb up. Our journey is\
  \ full of challenging surprises yet once in the jungle, I am gifted with richly\
  \ colored orchids, tiny ferns, moss and dense bamboo. As we get nearer to the summit,\
  \ our breath becomes shallower whilst steps become smaller and steeper. We can hear\
  \ cheers in the background and soon like other hikers, we smile and greet the microscopic\
  \ view of Machu Picchu with radiating lines that resemble the condor, a mighty spirit\
  \ of air and heavens overseeing everything. \nBack in the heart of the Machu Picchu\
  \ valley we learn from our guide Alain about the snake and the puma. Although I\
  \ don\u2019t fully understand the meaning of these I can feel the strength that\
  \ these people of the mountains had, including their knowledge of nature as they\
  \ made the beauty of the architecture match the landscape. I can sense their compassion\
  \ for those who entered the otherworldly or were misguided on their life path. I\
  \ feel the life force of the water collected from mountains, channeled with waste\
  \ to the crops in the terraces below. A temple for water, sun and earth which co-exist\
  \ together to create abundance. This interconnectedness is also seen in two stones\
  \ that meet each other, female and male, positive and negative. \nAlain snaps pictures\
  \ of us, kissing, smiling and laughing, legs dangling into the evaporating distance\
  \ of the mesmerizing landscape and then suddenly clouds shift, and drizzle turns\
  \ to rain. A single llama walks inquisitively towards us to say goodbye and a rainbow\
  \ paints the mountains. We find a covered spot delaying our goodbyes to this beautiful\
  \ Pacha Mama.\nThe Andean flute on my record plays and Palo Santo incense slowly\
  \ evaporates. I remember wind playing in the valley of Machu Picchu, the abundance\
  \ of nature and the generosity of people. I know that some memories fade, but this\
  \ one for sure will stay in my heart. I think it\u2019s because of love."
