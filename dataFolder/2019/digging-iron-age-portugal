Text: "When I arrived in Porto, I got in the EU line because in Spanish that stands\
  \ for Estados unidos, and as a Mexican-American it was my first time in Europe.\
  \ I didn't expect to find how wonderfully warm the people of Northern Portugal were,\
  \ or the carpets of flowers, film festivals and sculptures, roasted sardines and\
  \ festivals where people Bop each other on the head and no fights break out. It\
  \ was immediately welcoming and yet completely different than anything I had experienced\
  \ in North or South America, I definitely felt a connection to these people oh,\
  \ I saw people I recognized on every street corner. And the people saw and me something\
  \ that maybe they had seen in movies about drill sergeants, they joked that I ordered\
  \ my students around like a militia.   Taking 20 young adults to another country\
  \ was probably the bravest thing I've ever done,  marching them up the mountain\
  \ with gear every morning was probably the hardest thing I've ever done. Teaching\
  \ archaeology in a foreign country and a different language paled in comparison\
  \ to convincing your traveling companions to carry 200 lb of gear up a mountain\
  \ to look at Iron Age ruins. But the afternoon that I heard a metallic thunk after\
  \ one of my students thrown something out of their sifting screen, I knew we had\
  \ definitely found something. Now to find it on the forest floor covered in Pine\
  \ and Eucalyptus needles, everybody sifted through the dirt together until we found\
  \ what looks like a stick but no stick would have survived three meters under the\
  \ ground, it was a golden toga pin. I truly felt like the luckiest archaeologist\
  \ in the world standing on a mountain side with beautiful weather holding a piece\
  \ of history that had just been waiting to be discovered, and being in the right\
  \ place at the right time to hear the sound of it hitting a rock. In a country rich\
  \ with history, the ability to share the appreciation with students from another\
  \ country and have this be a teachable moment that trained young archaeologists\
  \ went on to do great work is a wealth that cannot be measured. \nThe museum gets\
  \ to keep the toga pin in the game pieces but my students and I took with us memories\
  \ and experiences that couldn't be found anywhere else in the world from Pottery\
  \ fired in pine needles, to fine goldsmiths and \n handcrafted lace, to  pastries\
  \ made with egg yolk that go back to the days that nuns had extra eggs, Portugal\
  \ left an impression that is indelible.\n I would love to go back to the UNESCO\
  \ sites and climb the mountains and maybe walk to Fatima this time, there were so\
  \ many things that I didn't get to do in 3 months that I could do in a week if I\
  \ didn't have to work! My son and I got to travel through part of the country and\
  \ I would love to go back! Maybe I could be a good luck charm again!"
