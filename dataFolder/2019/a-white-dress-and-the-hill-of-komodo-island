Text: "I love taking selfie! The most have stuff to bring when I do travelling is\
  \ a selfie stick, white dress and the flower headbands for perfect Instagram picture.\
  \ Recently, many people go to Komodo Island, taking selfie with three hills that\
  \ have three different sea water colour, so amazing ! Go googling the photo, and\
  \ you will shout \u2018Oh-my-God!\u2019\nTherefore here I am, join the Instagram\
  \ wave, with my selfie stick go to the Komodo Island. I started my day at morning,\
  \ my plane schedule are on 11am so I am not very scared to late, usually I always\
  \ scared. I go to the airport taking the bus, and here I am, stucked at the Indonesia\
  \ traffic legend. It was already 30 minutes before my plane schedule and I still\
  \ in the middle of traffic, while also scroll the travel agent to see other flight\
  \ possibility but could not get the one in the end at the same day. I got the ticket\
  \ to Komodo Island for tomorrow flight and decided to just stay in the airport,\
  \ which means not sleep. I need to arrived at the Komodo airport before 9 am tomorrow\
  \ or my travel group will say goodbye to me. \nI arrived at Komodo airport at 9\
  \ am and go to the small port while we will spent our night for 3 days at boat for\
  \ sailing trip around Komodo Island, scary no? However, Komodo only live in 2 Island\
  \ and we will not spend our night at that Island off course. As the most have items\
  \ for all my travel, I come with my white dress. The guide dropped us for the first\
  \ destination called Kelor Island, it is definitely a climbing hill with almost\
  \ 80-90 degree inclinitation. I never think that people in Instagram do this for\
  \ their selfie photo and it is really \u2018Oh-my-God!\u2019, the way I am going\
  \ up with my dress and the amazing scenery at the top is burned me into unbelievable\
  \ feeling and unbelievable burned skin, this Island was very hot.\nOther destination\
  \ we go was mostly a climbing hills with \u2018Oh-my-God\u2019 scenery and also\
  \ \u2018Oh-my-God-why-I-only-bring-dress\u2019. The highest hills I go is Padar\
  \ Island, this is the hills that we could see three hills with 3 different colour\
  \ of sea, going up here is amazing, but it is better than Kelor Island because mostly\
  \ we have stairs. The land was very dry because of the weather so it is a bit slippery,\
  \ added the difficulity for me to climb up, moreover there is no rope and under\
  \ you was the sea.\nWe met many wild animal like Dolphin, Manta, shark, eagle, and\
  \ off course the giant Komodo in this sunny Island. The most wonderful is doing\
  \ drone phote at the beautiful pink beach, it was a beach with pink coloured sand\
  \ beach due to pink algae, it was beautiful so I laid down in the beach until I\
  \ realized my skin have 2 different colour like a zebra in the hand, it is not pink\
  \ off course.\nKomodo Island are perfect Island to learn hiking before you face\
  \ the mountain, just don\u2019t bring dress like me when you go there. It is also\
  \ better go diving than snorkeling there because the easy snorkeling spot was not\
  \ that good, or maybe because we don\u2019t meet it only. Bring the powerfull sunscreen\
  \ is must, although I don\u2019t know if it works or not. Go black and say Hi to\
  \ Komodo !"
