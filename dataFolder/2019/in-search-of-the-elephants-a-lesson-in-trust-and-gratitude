Text: "The bus arrived in Taungoo at 01:50 am. I did not know where to go. I walked\
  \ through the deserted streets until I found a group of men sitting on tiny plastic\
  \ stools on the street side.  With some suspicion, I showed them the map to indicate\
  \ where I wanted to go. One of them got up from the seat, and with a smile showing\
  \ the teeth eaten away by the Kwun-ya, (areca nut, slaked lime and tobacco wrapped\
  \ in the betel vine leaf, chewed for its stimulant effects) he motioned for me to\
  \ follow him. When I saw him going on a motorcycle, I understood that he would give\
  \ me a ride. I cannot deny that I was scared. After entrusting me once again to\
  \ all Gods, I too got on the motorcycle, feeling how the weight of my backpack would\
  \ make me fall backwards as soon as he started the engine.\n\nThe night wind brushed\
  \ my face, and for a few seconds at least I felt calm. Around ten minutes went by\
  \ after he stopped his motorcycle. There were no lights. Some skinny dogs came to\
  \ meet us with thunderous barks. The man extended his arm as saying: \"Here it is,\
  \ I'm leaving.\" Pleased with his kindness, I extended him 3000 kyat. Meanwhile,\
  \ I felt relieved to be at my place. With a small bow he left and by then, a man\
  \ with gray disheveled hair came to see why his dogs were barking. \"Good evening\
  \ sir, I'm sorry to arrive at this time. I have a reservation. My name is Carmen\
  \ \" I said. With some broken English he answered: \u201CI was expecting you at\
  \ 10pm\u201D. Distressed by the time, I indicated that Yangon's bus had a mechanical\
  \ problem and it took more than 3 hours to repair it. \n\nHe showed me my room,\
  \ and I fell asleep immediately. Breakfast at the Myanmar Beautiful Guest House\
  \ felt heavenly. I had not eaten for more than 24 hours and the ohn-note-kout-swe,\
  \ which is a coconut soup with noodles and chicken served with Paratha, a flatbread,\
  \ were my salvation.\nI was ready for my next adventure. The purpose of my stop\
  \ in Taungoo was to visit an elephant reserve. However, and to my disenchantment,\
  \ the man at the front desk explained that to go to the reserve, it was required\
  \ to have at least four clients, otherwise, I would have to pay for four. Obviously,\
  \ traveling as a backpacker, I could not afford to pay that much. I decided to leave\
  \ messages to the other guests to see if they wanted to jump with me into that adventure\
  \ the next day.\n\nMeanwhile, I took one of the bicycles that were available to\
  \ the guests to go to tour the town. I found a path next to a river where some children\
  \ were bathing, and as I passed they looked at me with mischief. A little further\
  \ ahead, I sat down to drink some water and suddenly I heard some whistles. I noticed\
  \ that a girl who was also riding a bicycle, watched me with suspicion from behind\
  \ a tree. I waived her and she waved back, indicating that I should follow her.\
  \ I grabbed my bike and drove behind her. We arrived at a humble house and some\
  \ people came out. I assume, they were her family members. With kind gestures they\
  \ invited me to come to the house. A photograph of Aung San Suu Kyi hung on a wall.\
  \ The women started to prepare something to eat and soon after, I was sitting at\
  \ a wooden table, while the members of the family were standing around me, looking\
  \ with satisfaction. They had their cheeks covered in thanaka, a yellowish white\
  \ paste made from a tree which they use to protect themselves from the sun.\n\n\
  I returned to the hostel with my heart swollen with such generosity. Upon my arrival,\
  \ I discovered that I had already completed the quota to go to the elephant reserve,\
  \ but this will be part of another story."
