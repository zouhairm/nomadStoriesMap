Text: "I was on my scooter, after my first hanging out day in Kuta, going back to\
  \ the hostel. Just 5, maybe 10 minutes and my bed would have been happy to welcome\
  \ me, after a long day walking and exploring around. The hostel was a little far\
  \ out, in another village really close going with that black scooter. It was a dirt\
  \ narrow road, gravel and sand, and the stars in the sky were almost the only light\
  \ I could trust in, running there, with a great hill on the left and just unknown\
  \ black on my right. \n\nThe first day was great, becoming familiar with that new\
  \ place really far from home and with a completely different way of life. Meeting\
  \ people, walking on the short alleys and breathing something I had never seen.\
  \ But now, 2 o\u2019clock in the morning, my bed was waiting and I was already looking\
  \ forward tomorrow. I was not yet aware if staying there another day or going to\
  \ Ubud, starting my tour on the island but, fine, tomorrow was close.\n\nWe were\
  \ a line, my two friends ahead and then me, watching and following them on the gravel.\
  \ Suddenly, a stone. A really short stone, better called a great piece of gravel:\
  \ my front wheel hit it and I took off. Literally, an almost vertical take off with\
  \ my scooter just behind me. Don\u2019t know why, my flight was in the wrong direction:\
  \ right. Heading to the black, unknown part of the mountain I could even not imagine.\
  \ I could not see how deep was, what was, if sand, gravel, wood, forest, water.\
  \ Nothing. All of my entire life passed through that dark directly to my eyes during\
  \ those seconds, three seconds flight in the unknown. And, after three endless seconds,\
  \ I landed. I heard something like a deaf noise really close to me, like a \u201C\
  thud\u201D, and suddenly my scooter appeared, two meters at my left.\n\nGreat surprise,\
  \ great relief: I had nothing, no pain, no perceptible wounds. But now, how about\
  \ going up, climbing the three meters to the road? After the flight, it was not\
  \ so obvious: no way, no hooks on the terrain. But.. suddenly, a light. A dim light\
  \ coming quietly from the right side of the path, the side where I was heading,\
  \ before the flight. Two French guys, two hands helping me climb that little three\
  \ meters hill, to the road. My friends arrived in a few minutes, after realizing\
  \ the queue was of two people instead of three. Not bad, as my first day in Bali."
