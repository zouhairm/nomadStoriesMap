Text: "No amount of research or planning can prepare you for the experience of being\
  \ in Marrakesh. Sure, you can read every blog on the topic and stalk the TripAdvisor\
  \ forums until you\u2019re sure you\u2019ll know how to keep your wits about you\
  \ and how to navigate the souks. But once you\u2019re there? It is unlike anything\
  \ you could have imagined.\n\nYou get off the plane, jet-lagged and exhausted. You\u2019\
  re shuffled through customs and the baggage claim. You notice that the airport is\
  \ shiny and modern when you were expecting something smaller and outdated. You find\
  \ your name being held by a cab driver hired to take you to your riad (hotel). Muttering\
  \ two of the few French words you know (\u201CBonjour\u201D and \u201CMerci\u201D\
  ), you climb into the taxi, ready to be whisked away to a new world.\n\nThe first\
  \ thing you notice is that there are motorbikes everywhere. Swerving in front of\
  \ the car, passing each other within an inch of their lives, carrying multiple people\
  \ or things that couldn\u2019t possibly fit on a car, let alone a motorbike. Slightly\
  \ terrified for your life, you put your faith in your driver navigating the road.\
  \ It only intensifies as you approach the Medina walls \u2013 the walls that enclose\
  \ the old town of Marrakesh and where you\u2019ll be staying for the next few days.\
  \ Now there are people thrown into the mix, darting across the street, squeezing\
  \ through cars, seamlessly blending into this rhythmic chaos. \n\nYou are driven\
  \ through the main square: Jemaa el-Fnaa. You\u2019d read about this place, you\
  \ knew it was the heartbeat of the city, the center of frenetic energy. What you\
  \ didn\u2019t think to anticipate? Riding through the square in a car. If you thought\
  \ the streets with the clearly labeled lanes were bad, this is downright uncomfortable.\
  \ No, it\u2019s not the fact that there are no designated areas for pedestrians\
  \ vs. cars vs. motorbikes vs. donkeys; it\u2019s the speed with which people are\
  \ still moving! Your heart starts thumping as your driver pushes through without\
  \ slowing down and you begin to admire the miraculous subconscious flow everything\
  \ seems to have here. \n\nJust as you begin to feel more at ease, your cab driver\
  \ suddenly stops and gets out. You grab your backpack and start to follow him through\
  \ a tiny alleyway full of people. This is the way to your hotel? These are the streets?!\
  \ But I studied the map, these were streets, not alleyways! This whole city is actually\
  \ small alleyways? Your brain starts adjusting to the new information while you\u2019\
  re quickening your pace to keep up with the driver. You pass by shop fronts full\
  \ of souvenirs and knick-knacks, the shop owners beckoning you to slow down and\
  \ take a look. You remember articles you read about haggling and your mind struggles\
  \ to grasp the fact that you\u2019ll have to do that later in order to bring anything\
  \ home. \n\nYour driver takes a sharp left into an alley that\u2019s no bigger than\
  \ two people wide and at the end of it he knocks on a door. You brace yourself,\
  \ your senses overwhelmed. The door opens and you step inside, into a literal oasis.\
  \ The noise dissolves, the fried nerves melt away, the quiet settles into your skin\
  \ \u2013 you are home. This was another situation your research alluded to: the\
  \ peace of the riad is an \u201Cescape from the craziness of Marrakesh.\u201D You\
  \ can almost quote what you read. But, again, no amount of planning could prepare\
  \ you for this absolute calming of the senses, this entry into a portal that is\
  \ both in the city but separate from the city, this extreme polarity that can exist\
  \ so effortlessly. \n\nYou check in, go upstairs, marvel at the intricate design\
  \ of the riad, slip into your room and immediately collapse on the bed. You are\
  \ so appreciative of the oasis you found for yourself, you almost don\u2019t want\
  \ to leave. But the curiosity of what\u2019s in the square, the desire to learn\
  \ how to haggle, the need to experience everything this city has to offer \u2013\
  \ this pull is too strong. You freshen up, grab your bag and set out to conquer\
  \ this place\u2026one alleyway at a time."
