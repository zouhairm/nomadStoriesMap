Text: "For the first-timer traveler to Paris, I didn\u2019t have much time to stroll\
  \ around the city because I was in a work-related trip and only had one day of free\
  \ time to enjoy the city. My first impression of Paris was like what I have been\
  \ hearing so far; The city is beautiful and very romantic. I have this image of\
  \ Paris as the result of admiring the city from movies point of views. Paris in\
  \ the movie looks so charming and beautiful. It also gives a romantic ambiance to\
  \ the story.\nThere was a scene from movie \u201CBefore Sunset\u201D that really\
  \ intrigued me when I plan this trip. I realized that I grew a little obsession\
  \ on Seine River because of how Celine and Jesse; the two-main character of the\
  \ movie, shared a deep conversation while cruising Seine River on a tourist boat.\
  \ I told myself, \u201CI have to get on one of those boat.\u201D\nThe day of having\
  \ a free time came and I decided to start with the most iconic and monumental part\
  \ of Paris; Eiffel Tower. It was a rainy day in an autumn afternoon. I walked on\
  \ Quai Branly Street and experienced how the city relates to the Eiffel. Old and\
  \ new building side by side gracefully and the river create a horizontal notion\
  \ that makes the Eiffel even more stand out and charming.  The Eiffel Tower was\
  \ getting bigger and bigger as I walk closer and made my way to Pont d\u2019Lena.\
  \ \nIt is true that you will never understand Eiffel before you go there yourself\
  \ and feel the scale and how it relates to the city, river, and people. It was like\
  \ seeing a bigger picture about history and the future. And, the bridge is also\
  \ very special. it is not just a means of crossing the river. It celebrates the\
  \ living of the people, history, and also creates space and platform to admire the\
  \ beauty of Seine River.\nFrom Eiffel Tower, I continued my trip by taking one of\
  \ the river boat to cruise along Seine River. It is true that the Seine River is\
  \ the most beautiful avenue of the Paris. I can see that people really appreciate\
  \ the beauty of the buildings and enjoy being outdoor; by the river. Passing by\
  \ many great museum buildings such as Musee de\u2019Orsay, Musee de l\u2019Orangerie,\
  \ and many more. Then, I got closer to The Ile-de-la-cite, City Island; an island\
  \ in the middle of Seine River where we can find Notre-Dame Cathedral and Sainte\
  \ Chapelle. My heart skipped a beat when our boat approaches the island closer and\
  \ pass it by. \nThe trip ended near Pont Marie and as I got out of the boat, I am\
  \ still so amazed. I thought the cruise will only let me see beautiful sight of\
  \ buildings, amazing bridges, and give me interesting point of view of enjoying\
  \ Paris. But the experience of the space, seeing them in person, and how calming\
  \ and how nice the ripple of Seine River that day are the little things that showed\
  \ me the magic of Paris.\nI walked to Pont Marie to Pont de Tournelle as it was\
  \ one of the movie location of \u201COne Day\u201D, I went down to the riverbank\
  \ and sit there while watching and listening to what other people were doing to\
  \ enjoy a beautiful night. I was already 7 o\u2019clock PM but the day was still\
  \ bright. I end the trip with a quick visit to Shakespere and The Company as it\
  \ is the ultimate movie location of \u201CBefore Sunset\u201D Where Jesse has a\
  \ book reading and signing before meeting Celine. \nI was only a half day trip in\
  \ one part of Paris, but it leaves a deep impression in me. I didn\u2019t expect\
  \ to see so many aspects of the city in such a short trip. Paris indeed has a romantic\
  \ soul. Even when I travelled alone, I could still feel the notion of loving the\
  \ life. And, that is why Seine River charmed me."
