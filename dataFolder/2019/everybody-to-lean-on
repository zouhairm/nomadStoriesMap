Text: "It is a dawn like any other in the quiet Oaxacan countryside, mere minutes\
  \ before the first rays of light ricochet off shiny metal fences, warm the air in\
  \ minutes, and signal to the roosters to corral the masses. Two exposed calves saunter\
  \ down the gravel driveway. Groggy for reasons other than morning-time, a young\
  \ man creaks open the very same door we broke the handle off of a week prior. It\
  \ is the door to my house. Next, the door to my room.\n\nI surge awake to him crouched\
  \ above me. Whoareyou? I breathe, even though I know. I am looking right at his\
  \ face, chocolate skin pulled taught over two pronounced cheekbones. His eyes look\
  \ right past me. The next few things happen in a matter of seconds. He rises and\
  \ runs for the door. I chase him. He\u2019s faster. He escapes into the break of\
  \ day with my money, passport, and peace of mind bobbing in his pockets.\n\nThat\
  \ man was a friend to me. We had shared many hours together living on a family-run\
  \ farm in Mitla, Oaxaca, a place recognized worldwide for Day of the Dead and its\
  \ rich gastronomy. His life story trickled out during our free time: nearly two\
  \ decades spent in shelters in another state of Mexico. My appearance and my accent\
  \ reminded him of the gringos put in charge at the shelters, he said, the ones he\
  \ hated because they treated him so poorly.\n\nWhen normal life stopped for me after\
  \ the robbery, it did for my friends in Mitla, too. Their sense of compassion and\
  \ loyalty amazed me, an unsurprising response from a U.S. citizen experiencing the\
  \ backbone of collectivism. My farm family lent me over $300 for groceries and a\
  \ new passport and accompanied me through a web of legal proceedings. My farm brother\
  \ championed a maddening conversation with a city official who kept assuming I had\
  \ a romantic relationship with the robber. When my rising frustration rendered me\
  \ speechless, he took over. These aren\u2019t necessary questions, he said, let\u2019\
  s stick to the facts. \n\nPeople I knew from ambits of life rallied behind me. Seriously\u2014\
  my cell phone blew up with calls and texts from everyone and their cousin. Cualquier\
  \ cosa, Amanda, y tu me marcas / Whatever you need, Amanda, call me, my fruit vendor\
  \ told me. A friend skipped work to fix my door handle and the local police did\
  \ rounds past my house; the sound of tires rolling over gravel became a sacred nighttime\
  \ comfort. These were people I\u2019d known for less than a year. At the same time,\
  \ my friends from the states told me they could call me after work.\n\nWhen I arrived\
  \ home a few weeks later, my initial conversations were fraught. The story of the\
  \ robbery confirmed people\u2019s deepest biases about Mexico. I could see it in\
  \ their scrunched up faces. I could hear it their resolute tone. Thank God you\u2019\
  re home, now. There was no room for my truth; I couldn\u2019t be devastated about\
  \ the robbery and adore Oaxaca at the same time. After four months, I repacked my\
  \ bag and went back to the very same farm where it all happened. My friends and\
  \ family were perplexed. They didn\u2019t understand my connection to Mitla.\n\n\
  Because even if you saw its stunning landscape\u2014how concrete houses with gravel\
  \ driveways blend into pastoral fields and breathtaking mountains\u2014or tasted\
  \ the mind-blowing flavors of mole negro, you wouldn\u2019t understand the root\
  \ of my adulation. My reverence for this town comes from the people in it. Their\
  \ way of showing love and support is like the sun that shines over 300 days out\
  \ of the year: strong, reliable, warms you from the outside-in. \n\nThe guy who\
  \ stole my stuff hasn\u2019t been spotted since the town excommunicated him. That\
  \ was not a formal legal action, by the way. The locals banished him after I came\
  \ forward with the robbery. No one messes with their people, or their resident gringa."
