Text: "Small, circular ripples began forming one by one against the crystal teal water.\
  \ The little targets began expanding and multiplying as the drops of water began\
  \ to infiltrate the lake\u2019s surface. While the rain marked the lake as its territory,\
  \ the air snuck into the cuffs of my jean jacket, and sent another army of chills\
  \ into my body. The rain began to take over the lake and my eyes couldn\u2019t be\
  \ taken off the small circular ripples. There\u2019s no other place where I can\
  \ sit and watch the rain fall over a lake for hours and not have a second thought.\
  \ A rush swelled into my eyes \u2013 not from the cold. I don\u2019t know when I\u2019\
  ll come back to this enchanting place. The rain claimed its last soldier in the\
  \ form of a tear that slid down my frozen, rosy cheek. Once it hit the concrete,\
  \ I was waving my white flag. I surrender, Interlaken. I surrender to your beauty,\
  \ grace, tranquility and, now, the heartbreak that comes with leaving. Is the heartbreak\
  \ worth going to this little Swiss town?\n\nWith a population of just over 5,000\
  \ people and with most of the land occupied by rivers and lakes, Interlaken does\
  \ not seem like the type of place to cause such heartbreak. The smell of cow manure\
  \ sneaks its way into my nasal cavity while the chill of the air is still causing\
  \ my arm hair to stand up. But next to me, while walking over the array of gray\
  \ pebbles on the ground, the bright lake stares back at me. As the cyan blanket\
  \ of water expands to the edges of shore, you can begin to clearly see to the bottom.\
  \ Underneath the lake lie hundreds of perfectly rounded moss covered rocks that\
  \ drew me into a peaceful hypnosis. Still unsure of how a simple creation of nature\
  \ could cause such a reaction, I keep walking. Beyond the water, emerges downtown\
  \ Interlaken.\n\nA giant grass field opens up in front of me, and shadows appear\
  \ as if they are falling to the ground. As I look up, a blue and white parachute\
  \ with the phrase \u201CParagliding Interlaken\u201D is floating over me and heading\
  \ towards the center of the field. The people strapped to the bottom of the parachute\
  \ sprinkle down cheers of glee and accomplishment as they slide down, legs up, onto\
  \ the ground. Above them, there are four other parachutes in the air, all at different\
  \ levels, angles, and directions making their way down to the grass.\n\nAs I pass\
  \ the parachuting field, a sign is propped outside of a quaint red and white shop\
  \ that reads: \u201CSkinny people are easier to kidnap. Eat chocolate.\u201D Inside\
  \ of the store, the previous whiffs of cow manure are conquered by the allure of\
  \ fresh milk chocolate fondue to be poured over a cup of ripe strawberries. Funky\
  \ Chocolate Club, a famous chocolate store in Interlaken, has every flavor, type\
  \ and shape of chocolate \u2013 pomegranate dark chocolate bars, chocolate espresso\
  \ beans in a cardboard Chinese takeout box, chocolate in the shape of a Rolex watch,\
  \ even a tiny dark chocolate Johnson.\n\nAfter scraping every last bit of chocolate\
  \ using a toothpick with a paper Swiss flag on it, I head back to my hostel. Every\
  \ person I pass has a beanie on their head and a smile on their face. They chat\
  \ with their significant other, friend, or even stranger. The simplicity of the\
  \ town is all these people need. \n\nEveryone is always doing something. Answering\
  \ a text, responding to an email, running to a meeting, doing something. Anything\
  \ to keep them distracted. When people slow down, they are scared that they will\
  \ drown in their thoughts. But it\u2019s quite the opposite. They realize that the\
  \ simplicity is what is causing all the joy. Interlaken is a place where simplicity\
  \ is cherished, and staying present in the moment is not a mindset that people aim\
  \ to achieve \u2013 it\u2019s their lifestyle.\n\nSo why shouldn\u2019t you visit\
  \ this town in Switzerland? Because no other place will make you feel heartbroken\
  \ when you leave the way that Interlaken does."
