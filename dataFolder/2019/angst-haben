Text: "Some people expect to hear about travelling in foreign lands, exploring a new\
  \ world, learning about a new culture and language. \nI, indeed, did so, when I\
  \ moved to Finland. I have chosen to live far from my roots, torn between the need\
  \ to run away from the past and the hope things would be better in the future. \n\
  I travelled into the wild nature of Finland, I had learnt Finnish, I explored their\
  \ own world. I had found a some sort of peace, that was I thought. Nonetheless,\
  \ running here and there, fulfilling plenty of obligations and duties, is like running\
  \ away. From what? \nMyself. \nThose people who would expect to hear about travelling\
  \ in foreign lands, exploring a new world, learning about a new culture and language\
  \ forget about the internal travel, that one would need to end up their forever\
  \ flee and make peace with themselves for once and for all. \nI didn't expect to\
  \ find anything, to find the safe land into myself, to explore more than I had explored\
  \ in the past. I feared those dangerous waves, dark and gigantic, ready to drown\
  \ me. Everytime I closed my eyes, I had that feeling I would suffocate and die.\
  \ However, I needed to travel my inner self."
