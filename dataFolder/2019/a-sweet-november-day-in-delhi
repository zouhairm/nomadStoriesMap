Text: "Don\u2019t go to \u201Csmog-central\u201D Delhi, they said. It\u2019s unsafe\
  \ for women, they said. A day-trip to the capital is frivolous at your pay-grade\
  \ they said. Flying in-and-out within 12 hours with Delhi\u2019s traffic and weather\
  \ conditions after an evening event that includes high tea, a cultural show, networking\
  \ cocktails and dinner\u2026 impossible, they said. How will you make your flight,\
  \ they worried? The commute will be a nightmare \u2013 crowded buses, the auto (tuk-tuk)\
  \ drivers will overcharge and take you for a ride in more ways than one, cabs are\
  \ unsafe, and the metro doesn\u2019t go close enough to the diplomatic enclave of\
  \ Chanakyapuri \u2013 named for the canny royal advisor to the Maurya dynasty. Why\
  \ do you want to go?\nThere were multiple reasons to avoid the trip. But I so wanted\
  \ a break from routine. I went anyway! I got on the flight deaf to Delhi\u2019s\
  \ detractors. And it was great that I did. For Delhi and Delhi-ites were at their\
  \ most charming. \nI landed in Delhi\u2019s Indira Gandhi International Airport\
  \ at mid-day on the morning flight from Chennai\u2019s Kamaraj Domestic Terminal.\
  \ And when I stepped out of the flight, the crisp sunny day was like a clear spring\
  \ day rather than the expected foggy-smoggy welcome. I was to meet a classmate in-between.\
  \ We had decided on an Italian feast at Big Chill Caf\xE9 in Delhi\u2019s posh yet\
  \ bustling Khan Market. With only a backpack I was out of the airport and on the\
  \ city-bound metro in no time. A smooth commute \u2013 walking to the Airport metro\
  \ terminal, a ride to Shivaji Stadium station on the Orange Line and then a 15-minute\
  \ tuk-tuk ride to Khan Market. The air was cool and clear and I didn\u2019t need\
  \ an AC cab! I even got a quick glimpse of India Gate and reached Khan Market in\
  \ time to meet my friend who was shopping at the famous Bahrison\u2019s Booksellers\
  \ \u2013 our designated meeting point. I had worked up an appetite after all the\
  \ multi-modal travel. \nOver Big Chill Caf\xE9\u2019s creamy lasagna and to-die-for\
  \ chocolate cake, my friend and I caught up. It had been two years since we had\
  \ met. Time flew! It then struck me that my mother would disown me if I returned\
  \ from Delhi without our family\u2019s favorite Delhi snack - 'mathri'.  A cross\
  \ between a scone and a biscuit, mathri comes in a range of flavors and sizes -\
  \ we love the fenugreek-flavored ones best. I fitted in some quick shopping as I\
  \ booked an Uber to the Chinese Embassy despite congestion around Khan Market meaning\
  \ a potentially 20-minute wait! Yet, I didn\u2019t want to miss out on the mathri\
  \ and Afghan dried fruits bargains. \nThe Uber driver, Jagwant, was the best thing\
  \ that happened to me in Delhi. Once he learned where I had to go, he guided me\
  \ over the phone to another exit from Khan Market - not the pinned pickup!  We beat\
  \ traffic! Jagwant was a godsend. With a hurried farewell to my friend I jumped\
  \ in the Uber. In the 10-minute journey, as I packed the shopping into my backpack,\
  \ Jagwant learnt my schedule. Going above and beyond, he told me I would reach the\
  \ airport faster from the embassy if I took a cab to Dhaula Kuan metro station and\
  \ went from there instead of taking a cab direct to the airport, as post-dinner\
  \ the commute to the domestic terminal would be hectic.  He also checked to make\
  \ sure I had web checked-in and printed my return boarding pass to avoid hassles.\
  \ \nDinner was on the lawns of the ambassador\u2019s residence under fairy lights\
  \ and beside a fabulous fountain. Fears that the air quality would give me lung\
  \ disease (!!) were put to rest when our hosts told us that it had rained the previous\
  \ day clearing up the smog. Armed with on-point instructions from Jagwant, I was\
  \ just in time security check and a masala chai enhanced flight home! \n\n I was\
  \ happy to shutdown Delhi\u2019s detractors armed with delicious mathri, assuring\
  \ them that the shopping was super, food - fab, traffic - manageable, metro - marvelous,\
  \ air quality - crisp and the Uber driver - a godsend!"
