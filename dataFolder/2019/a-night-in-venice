Text: "He had arrived in Venice exhausted from the road, the past and the world. It\
  \ was to be his final night in Venice and after the alcohol and interactions of\
  \ the previous nights, he was comfortably resigned to spend the night in bed sober.\n\
  \nShe arrived in Venice, habituated the bed next to his and immediately set about\
  \ ruining these plans with a lively introduction and an intriguing demeanour. Fresh\
  \ from a year abroad and using Venice as a pitstop on her way 'home', she was ready\
  \ to make the most of her time. \n\nAfter a brief scuffle with the hostel owner\
  \ over administrative matters not worth detailing, the pair headed out to the streets\
  \ of Venice to dine on the local cuisine. The boy was surprised at how smoothly\
  \ they became fast friends, considering his subconsciously guarded approach and\
  \ her seemingly open atmosphere. Dinner was followed up by the golden find of a\
  \ certain brew (rare, cost effective, despicable in taste) from back home.\n\nShe\
  \ was several years younger, yet unfairly so she was just as experienced with life.\
  \ They wandered down to a more spacious area of cobbled stones amongst the canal.\
  \ Darts were smoked, words were exchanged, brews were sipped at and laughter was\
  \ exploited. Tales of their home countries (so far away) were engulfed by both parties,\
  \ ambitions explored, but most of all the present moment appreciated. A quick dash\
  \ to avoid the sudden splash of a water ambulance streaming past installed fresher\
  \ laughter still, amongst the relaxed afternoon air. The boy managed to save her\
  \ pack of darts from the subsequently rapid overflow of water onto the street steps.\
  \ An impressive move. \n\nGathering the remaining brews they jumped upon a temporarily\
  \ abandoned water taxi station floating in the canal. There is something to be said\
  \ for shared music inclinations, as it tells a story of the shared experiences of\
  \ a soul. The pair traded their favourite tunes, which were uncannily recognised\
  \ by each participant, as they both failed to bring something new to the ear of\
  \ the other in their niche of a lyrical exchange. Such symmetry had not been encountered\
  \ nor felt by either traveller before. This was simultaneously mirrored in action;\
  \ as life stories were expressed, poetry analysed, dark secrets freely revealed\
  \ for the first time, and a sense of finding another realised. These were not just\
  \ generalised statements, but genuine admissions of depression, anxiety, homelessness,\
  \ family tragedies, and hardship. \n\nThis soon led to a shortage of brews for the\
  \ troubled souls and an expedition to a local tavern was born. Some time later they\
  \ realised they were indeed much too drunk and consequently much too poor to pay\
  \ for the whiskey tab they had accumulated. This resulted in the dastardly, yet\
  \ daring act of their rooftop escape in Venice. Never had they felt so alive.\n\n\
  Holding hands, fresh from their immoral yet cleansing escape, they jumped onto an\
  \ empty gondola parked upon a quiet part of the city. They lay with each other here\
  \ under the stars of Venice. Afterwards they held each other for many an hour before\
  \ they finally retrieved their clothes and headed back to their abode (with passionate\
  \ kisses pressed up against the walls of dangerously abandoned alleys along the\
  \ way). The time had come to part ways for the night. He tried to explain to her\
  \ how much the night had meant. In return she offered sentiments of staying in touch\
  \ and a visit to the Southern Hemisphere. \n\nEarly the next morning the boy paused\
  \ admiring the beauty asleep with her flushed cheeks and peaceful smile. He then\
  \ kissed her goodbye on the forehead, mounted his bag upon his back and resumed\
  \ his travels, still stunned at what he'd found."
