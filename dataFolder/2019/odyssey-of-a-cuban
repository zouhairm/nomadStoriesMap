Text: I when all the way from Ecuador to USA, I crossed all the borders of all countries
  from Ecuador to the United States. I got lost in the jungle of Colombia for 2 days
  where I had to survive barely without water and without food. I was chased by the
  paramilitaries of Colombia on the border with Panama because they wanted to seize
  my belongings, and I had to fight with one of them to survive because he almost
  took my life, thank God I have enough experiences of martial arts I could defend
  myself from one of my persecutors, in the attempt to escape I lost the notion of
  the road and I began to insert into the jungle, and in the middle of the darkness
  of the night I lost the notion and the sense of direction and fell down a precipice
  of 20 meters highfalling to the edge of the sea on the reefs and dislocating my
  knee severely, I myself returned the knee its place causing an unbearable pain,
  As if it was not enough, it began to rain intensely and lightning sounded in the
  sky, it was totally dark something unheard of almost like a movie, I spent the night
  in the rain holding the dislocated knee pain and waited until dawn, at dawn hopeful
  I began to scream to see if someone will hear my screams and nothing nothing nothing
  was felt more than my voice in the middle of the dense jungle in the limits of Panama
  and Colombia, I dragged myself barely by a distance of almost 8 to 10 miles to reach
  a beach called Miel beach, I was received by the Panamanian border guard who helped
  me feed me,Then I was transferred on a boat to a small town called Puerto obaldia
  where I stayed for more than 3 days. Recovering from the long day and crossing,
  then travel in a plane in very bad conditions to Panama City where he continues
  traveling through the country with a safe passage eaten emigration to get to the
  next country Costa Rica,I arrived at night at the border between Panama and Costa
  Rica where I had to wait while sleeping in the street until they opened the border
  the next day at 6 in the morning Once the immigration office was opened, they gave
  us a pass that allowed us to pass through the Costa Rican country until we reached
  the Nicaraguan border. the events on the border between Nicaragua and Costa Rica
  were really dangerous and without mentioning what happened in Guatemala in Costa
  Rica in me in all countries and especially to get to Mexico how dangerous it was
  but the luxury of detail we will give it to meet in the in the book that we will
  publish some day so that everyone knows the Odyssey of a Cuban...
