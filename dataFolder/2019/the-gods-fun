Text: "India is full of gods! It seems strange to our Arabian culture. This strangeness\
  \ made the story I had to tell since 2016. I have a book published in Arabic language\
  \ about India, it won Ibn Battuta prize for Arab travel literature. otherwise, what\
  \ was my experience there? \nSuddenly, I traveled to unknown. followed up priests\
  \ and prayers in order to identify similarities between religions and different\
  \ cultures, which I want to know the secret of their peace decision because I was\
  \ coming from Egypt. Here, the one religion sides and movements are fighting continuously\
  \ and I think forever!  \nIn MENA region, we suffer from terrorism. so, I visited\
  \ the war room between extremist movements and Indian government in Kashmir to discover\
  \ the effects, goals and wrote a story about the silent war. someone told me that\
  \ he were waiting the great explosion there, but I noted that terrorists had some\
  \ strange techniques to fund their operations and occupy new areas. \nfor more than\
  \ 70 years, the war is running over India but they surrounded it in one province,\
  \ but the other sides are still live in peace! I asked: why? \nThe golden role was\
  \ that the work is the god, they didn't have a time or poverty to fight. that's\
  \ how Narendra Modi, the Prime Minister and former rulers judged their country.\
  \ They have a deal with the people: We will give you the food but don't talk in\
  \ politics. the poor people in India work every time to earn their living! without\
  \ working all the time, most of them will starve to death!\nSikhs, Buddhists and\
  \ Muslims had a free spaces to pray and visit their temples, like Hindus. On the\
  \ other hand, priests in all religions had the support to rob, lie and require donates\
  \ then seized the money after performing some magician rituals which hadn't any\
  \ spiritual values. \nI saw another India, which included entrepreneurs and youths\
  \ believed in business more than gods and temples. They were working in technology\
  \ factories and international companies then became Executive Director in some huge\
  \ companies. I shocked when I arrived Delhi because of the huge number of poor people\
  \ sleeping above the sidewalk at night! later, the mystery was solved. \nI lived\
  \ in 2 Indias, the first one was fighting the world until it became a huge economic\
  \ power. the other one was sleeping on the sidewalk. If you're Indian, you have\
  \ to decide in which India you want to live! \nwhat's the difference? the young\
  \ boy in the second India sold banana slices on the street but his first India's\
  \ brother sold banana slices online, with mobile application and delivery motorbike.\
  \ \nIn my travel, I visited some unknown religions and sects in MENA region then\
  \ captured and wrote their stories to my audience. I thought Arabian reader would\
  \ be Surprised at these incredible stories, gods, rituals, traditions, food and\
  \ ways for life. \nafter gods' talk, I headed to people: their delicious food and\
  \ spices, strange transport means such as toktok and manual rickshaw and half a\
  \ billion of people didn't have a bathroom or didn't have a bathroom culture. so,\
  \ they were taking off their clothes and pissing in the fresh air. \nGirls in India\
  \ didn't have their rights. so, I wrote some of their stories and it was effective\
  \ because they had a dreams but no money to achieve! they were open minded in the\
  \ opposite of men. It's an another silent war in India.\n I can title India story\
  \ \"Silent Wars Nation\" because it has several problems, which they can't talk\
  \ about. there's some slaves in India until now. No one of them can object or complain.\
  \ I asked why?, they told me: \"we can't in order to avoid the wrath of the gods\
  \ because they said that we are slaves and therefore, we have to serve the other\
  \ Hindu people for free and clean their bathrooms! It's our work according to holy\
  \ book to have a good life after deaths\".\nmy travel was full of wonders and stories.\
  \ they're enjoyable and difficult to absorb and tell later. It taught me how to\
  \ make peace, accept differences and changed my vision towards justice and work\
  \ value."
