Text: "This week, I began to read \u201CWherever You Go, There You Are\u201D by Jon\
  \ Kabat-Zinn\n\nThe title alone has really been running through my mind & has become\
  \ a reminder for me that there is nowhere to go, no \u2018thing\u2019 to attain,\
  \ no destination that will sooth our uneasiness. There will always be struggle,\
  \ discontent, unhappiness. There will always be those moments when we don\u2019\
  t want to be \u2018here\u2019. Looking back, so much of life has been a looking\
  \ ahead, as well as a longing for things of the past, which can create that underlying,\
  \ foreboding irritation that can lie beneath all of our Now moments.. Why is it\
  \ that we are so unable to Be.Here.Now, and when we are here Now in some of those\
  \ rare moments, we can still find ourselves being pulled again & again into such\
  \ a state of uneasiness. Thinking \u2018if only\u2019 I\u2019ll get that plane ticket,\
  \ or explore that rainforest, or sail across the Pacific Ocean, then I\u2019ll be\
  \ Free.  I\u2019ll be at ease with the world. I\u2019ll find myself & nothing will\
  \ bother me anymore..\n\nAnd this realization has finally become so crystal clear\
  \ to me on this particular part of my life where I am now. Brazil, India & Japan\
  \ didn\u2019t pierce this deep. But alas, the sailing trip I took from Nova Scotia\
  \ Canada, 1,000\u2019s of nautical miles south down the Atlantic has brought me\
  \ here to the French Island of Guadeloupe, & I\u2019ve finally been shown an important\
  \ realization\u2026 This gorgeous, butterfly shaped paradise, with mountains, lush\
  \ forests, beautiful people who take their cuisine seriously, simple village living\
  \ where you can get fresh fish everyday right from the fisherman\u2019s boat here\
  \ in the harbor, stunning surfing bodies on swells I just can\u2019t believe sometimes,\
  \ beaches I\u2019ve driven by that make my jaw drop in awe with their beauty~ So\
  \ many things. Million dollar views. I\u2019m here, living on a sailboat, rocked\
  \ to sleep each night with waves, less than a 2 minute walk from the locals surfing\
  \ beach, access to fresh fruit & vegetable markets daily, incredible warm weather\
  \ & pure sunshine each day that most people right now in the North would give anything\
  \ for. So why am I so discontented, & losing sight of where I am?\n\nLess than 2\
  \ years ago, I dreamed up this exact vision I wanted for my life. The landscapes,\
  \ the ocean, the people, the fresh food, the vegan diet, the lover, the beaches,\
  \ the extensive nautical miles of sailing, all of it came true. Almost scarily eerily\
  \ true. They say to be careful sometimes for what you wish for. I can tell you wishes\
  \ absolutely do come true. I, with pure intention & day dreaming, called this experience\
  \ into my awareness. The Universe not only brought that to me, but he\u2019s gorgeous\
  \ & with an English accent to boot. The Universe is fun like that.. It can give\
  \ you what you ask for, & then it\u2019ll throw in just a little bit extra frosting\
  \ on top.. But, each day, there is a nagging feeling that won\u2019t go away. Is\
  \ it really true that we can get & have anything we want, & still be miserable?\
  \ YES\n\nThe point I\u2019m trying to make, is NOTHING on the outside will make\
  \ us happy or content unless we address our inner world first. I\u2019ve also come\
  \ to realize this past year that true genuine heart in our life isn\u2019t felt\
  \ until we are actually living in a state of Giving, not just Getting. When we have\
  \ that deep flow of lending ourselves & our gifts to others. As the beautiful Author\
  \ & meditation teacher Biet Simkin says, \u201CWhat makes you extraordinary is not\
  \ how well you magnetize things to yourself, but how powerful you are at giving\
  \ to others. When you are an authentic conduit for others you will experience \u2018\
  having'\u201D.\n\nWhen we stop falling into the trap of distractions: food, sex,\
  \ thrills, wishing to be here or there, when we can sit with ourselves comfortably\
  \ through everything ~ the decadent as well as the uneasiness, we can really begin\
  \ to BE in our bodies, & live more fully. I feel peace, authenticity, & equanimity\
  \ can be achieved through the constant practice of this mindfulness. And stepping\
  \ into our true power as Givers."
