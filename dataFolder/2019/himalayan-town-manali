Text: "Being resident of hot deccan plateau I always wondered how it would be to experience\
  \ a snowfall , travel on ghat roads , trek the mountains , feel the air . Am going\
  \ to get all my questions answered . YES , my destination was MANALI - the town\
  \ cuddled in arms of Himalayas , the town I have been dreaming , the town I have\
  \ seen in most of Bollywood romantic beats . \nWe reached manali by 10 in morning\
  \ and stepped out of hotel at 12 . We took a bike to reach Solang Valley. The drive\
  \ up to Solang is simply breath -taking .You can witness the  scenic glimpses of\
  \ the adjoining mountains and valleys from almost every turn that the twisty uphill\
  \ road throws you. Beas river accompanied us all the way to Solang . I took snow\
  \ dress as it was compulsory , maybe sun glasses if requried . Solang valley is\
  \ known for its mesmerizing mountains , valleys dressed in snow . The locals, the\
  \ horses, the rides, the snow completed Solang  . Solang is known for winter sports\
  \ like Para gliding, skiing , horse rides and many . I went for paragliding which\
  \ costed 2000 bucks , but the view , the air driving me all the way , the bird like\
  \ feeling made it all worthy . The valley awakened kid in me and prompted to play\
  \ with snow . In the evening by 5 we start back from solang collecting a baggage\
  \ of memories heavier than my luggage."
