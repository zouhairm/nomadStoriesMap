Text: "It started with wanderlust seems to be the story of my life. My husband decided\
  \ the US Air Force could be the opportunity to give back while taking our family\
  \ places and it certainly has! \n\nWe are now stationed in Northern Italy absolutely\
  \ chasing our dreams each and every chance we get. \n\nLast week after arriving\
  \ six short months ago we scratched off our 10th country from the gem of a gift\
  \ we received \u201Cthe scratch off map\u201D. What a feeling of accomplishment\
  \ this is considering most trips we are traveling with two children and a dog. So\
  \ many said well once you have children the traveling stops, we decided this would\
  \ not be us. What better give could we give our children than bringing them along\
  \ to discover new cultures, new languages and especially new landscapes. For this\
  \ opportunity I am forever grateful. \n\nWe are not a wealthy family but we consider\
  \ ourselves so very rich with blessings of our travels. \n\nIf given this opportunity\
  \ I would commit to expressing the undiscovered beauty of Portugal from the eyes\
  \ of a simple person. A person who would not have had the opportunity to see the\
  \ world without the drive and desire to find a way outside of hitting the jackpot!\
  \ \n\nI would love the opportunity to focus on the people of Portugal, people seem\
  \ to be the most fascinating focus in European countries to me. So close to one\
  \ another yet so very differnet in culture and mannerism. \n\nI thank You for the\
  \ opportunity to apply and am postitive you will find the very best person to discover\
  \ the beauty of La Piel de Toro."
