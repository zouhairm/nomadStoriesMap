Text: "I\u2019m sitting in a big hall with dozens of other people. One by one they\
  \ tell short stories about themselves. There are British and Americans, French and\
  \ Canadians, Germans and Indians. And all of them speak excellent English. But my\
  \ English is not so good. Therefore in my turn, I can say just: \"Hi! My name is\
  \ Katya. And I arrived here for yoga practice\". \u201CMy karma-job will be toilet\
  \ cleaning for sure!\u201D \u2014 I decided after my very short speech. It is the\
  \ first day in the ashram somewhere in the Indian jungle and we are waiting for\
  \ the results of our self-presentations. \nAfter a short break, our teachers come\
  \ back and announce who will clean bathrooms and kitchens or will work in an ashram\
  \ shop. \u201CYou will make cocktails in a small ashram cafe\u201D \u2014 one of\
  \ the teachers tells me. I\u2019m very surprised because it is the best karma-job\
  \ ever! During working hours in the cafe, you are able to communicate with a lot\
  \ of people, make fresh juices, and eat and drink all unsold items at the end of\
  \ the day! It could be an excellent match if I knew anything about healthy cocktails...\n\
  In the first working day I make fresh vegan cocktails. It isn\u2019t hard: I get\
  \ a list of vegetables and fruits and need to bring them from fridges to a juice\
  \ machine. Everything goes smoothly till I get the list with three letters \u201C\
  ABC\u201D. \u201CWhat does it mean?\u201D \u2014 I ask my coworkers. But they have\
  \ never worked with cocktails, so they don\u2019t know. Someone remembered that\
  \ these are the first letters from fruit and vegetable names.\nOkay, \u201CA\u201D\
  \ is an apple, it\u2019s for sure. \u201CB\u201D is a beetroot, actually I don\u2019\
  t know anything else on \u201CB\u201D except banana. But banana cocktails are made\
  \ on the other station. What is \u201CC\u201D? I\u2019m looking around to find something\
  \ on \u201C\u0421\u201D and see a box full of cucumbers. \u201C\u0421\u201D is a\
  \ cucumber! I\u2019m really happy to realize it without any help. Now I need to\
  \ make a cocktail from an apple, beetroot, and a cucumber. It\u2019s easy! But...\
  \ who can drink it? This cocktail has a really awful taste! I don\u2019t understand\
  \ why people order it. However that evening visitors ordered a lot of ABC cocktails.\
  \ So I had to use the whole box of cucumbers.\nThe next day there are a lot of people\
  \ in the cafe. That\u2019s why a guy from a reception desk decides to help me. I\
  \ give him the necessary fruits and vegetables, and he makes cocktails in the juice\
  \ machine. The working process goes two times faster! We work as a real team...\
  \ Till I get a list with ABC order. Today I know, what to do! I give an apple and\
  \ beetroot to my workmate, but I can\u2019t find any cucumbers. I even ask a guy\
  \ who makes sandwiches and also use them: \u201CDo you know where I can find any\
  \ cucumbers?\u201D \u2014 \u201CUnfortunately, there is no cucumbers today. Can\u2019\
  t imagine what happened yesterday. There was a full box of them and it disappeared!\u201D\
  \ \u2014 he is very angry because of this situation. \u2014 \u201CThe delivery system\
  \ is not so good here!\u201D \u2014 I agree with him.\nBut the juice machine is\
  \ working! I run to my workmate and shout to him: \u201CStop the machine, we don\u2019\
  t have cucumbers today\u201D. Looking at his astonished face I start to understand\
  \ that something goes wrong. \u201CWhy do we need cucumbers?\u201D \u2014 he asks\
  \ me \u2014 \u201CI\u2019m waiting for a carrot for ABC cocktail\u201D. \u2014 \u201C\
  Oh, yes... a carrot!\u201D \u2014 such a stupid situation \u2014 \u201C\u0421\u201D\
  \ is a carrot! And it\u2019s really healthy and delicious cocktail \u2014 apple,\
  \ carrot, and beetroot. Not that awful drink I made yesterday with cucumbers. But\
  \ I\u2019m lucky that no one returned their orders yesterday. And it\u2019s for\
  \ the best if nobody here knows about my own version of ABC cocktail and what\u2019\
  s happened with the box of cucumbers..."
