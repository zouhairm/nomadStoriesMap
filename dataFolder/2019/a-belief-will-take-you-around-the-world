Text: "Believe in yourself, dream, work hard, and success will come. \n\nHello friend,\
  \ how are you doing tonight? I hope you will always be given health and abundant\
  \ sustenance so you can continue to walk around the world. Aamiin ... \n\nTonight\
  \ I would like to share my experience of the meaning of a belief that has led me\
  \ to travel around Asia and Europe. \n\nA way that makes me enjoy life more and\
  \ change my thinking. Life is not always about work, work, work or money, money,\
  \ money because we also need a holiday even though it costs a little money. But\
  \ remember the happiness and happiness we get after it is unpaid. At first I thought\
  \ going abroad was expensive and spent a lot of money, it was better to save money\
  \ than to spend money on traveling. but everything changed when I first lived, namely\
  \ in 2016 my feet could step on Kuala Lumpur Malaysia, Singapore and that same year\
  \ I also visited South Korea. \n\nThe thing I got from visiting these 3 countries\
  \ was a difference in language, culture, transportation, infrastructure, lifestyle,\
  \ and progress of civilization. \n\nI finally thought that humans must advance,\
  \ humans must change, otherwise they will be left behind by the progress of the\
  \ times."
