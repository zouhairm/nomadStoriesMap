Text: "My first visit to Paris was a remarkable experience, which I will never forget.\
  \ I booked the Dover-Calais ferry and drove with my wife from London in the cold\
  \ Christmas weather. We intended to stay until the New Year in a hotel located in\
  \ a centre of Paris and visit the city every day.\n\nIt was a great feeling to arrive\
  \ in Paris and see the city of light \xAD\u2013 a modern city with a very deep sense\
  \ of history. I will never forget when I first drove through, passing the canals\
  \ and seeing the monuments. It was like a huge open-air museum. It was love at first\
  \ sight.\n\nIt was dark in the evening, Christmas lights illuminating the whole\
  \ city. It was bright, almost like daytime. The streets were very busy, full of\
  \ shoppers marching from one shop to another. I was fascinated seeing The Palais\
  \ Garnier, which is the Paris Opera House. I parked my car in a small one way street\
  \ nearby. When we reached the main road, there was an underground station with a\
  \ big, lit-up sign displaying the word \u2018M\xE9tropolitain\u2019. I did not make\
  \ note of the road name, as I thought that the name of the station would be sufficient\
  \ for finding my car again. We visited the Opera house and walked towards Place\
  \ de la Concorde. We then walked back to find our car. I located what looked like\
  \ exactly the same \u2018M\xE9tropolitain\u2019 sign that I had noted in my head,\
  \ but it was not the right street.\n\nWas amazing \U0001F609"
