Text: "While I lived abroad in Norway for the year, people most often mistook me as\
  \ American based on my accent. When I say that I'm actually from Canada, they are\
  \ awfully apologetic, as if being associated as American was the worst. I found\
  \ it a bit bizarre - Canadians are more similar to Americans than they'd like to\
  \ admit. We kind of act like younger siblings who don't want anything to do with\
  \ their older sibling even though they're related. \n\nThere was also constant news\
  \ about shootings in America. So when I had to drive my car back to Vancouver from\
  \ Toronto via the USA, everyone asked incredulously, \"You really are going to drive\
  \ alone? Aren't you scared?\"\n\nI was more curious than scared. I wondered whether\
  \ these prejudices were really founded on anything substantial. I set off wondering\
  \ whether America was really as bad as everyone was making it out to be. \n\nWell\
  \ a week and a half into my road trip, I found myself charging my phone at McDonald's\
  \ in the middle of nowhere South Dakota at midnight because my car charger had broke.\n\
  \nThe woman I had talked to briefly in the washroom was at the next table with her\
  \ husband. They were from California, driving in the opposite direction for a wedding.\n\
  \nShe introduced me to her husband, \"Desiree is headed to Vancouver, Canada. She\
  \ started out in Toronto, went all the way down to Nashville and through the Midwest.\"\
  \n\nHer husband's eyes widened, \"Wow, that's quite a detour! If you're not in a\
  \ huge rush, you should definitely stop at the Badlands National Park. It's totally\
  \ worth it.\" \n\nI had never gone to a national park before but had heard my American\
  \ friends gush about them. I didn't have camping equipment but the couple said that\
  \ you can just drive through. Well, why not? \n\nThe next day, as I was driving\
  \ off the highway towards the Badlands, I tried to get my mindset ready. I reminded\
  \ myself to stay open and see what I discover. \n\nI was driving in the middle of\
  \ flat, dry, bushy grounds. Then all of sudden, these group of mountains appeared\
  \ on the horizon in the middle of nowhere. From far away, I could tell that they\
  \ were peppered with white and grey zigzag patterns. \n\nIt was as if a tornado\
  \ had spun through and gathered all the rocks in this one sprawling area, shaping\
  \ stately skyward spires and gouging great canyons along the way. I imagined someone\
  \ taking a brush to paint red, white, grey, and yellow grooves across the layers\
  \ of rock. They must have had fun.\n\nI took the whole day to drive through this\
  \ astonishing park. I learned that they were called the Badlands because French-Canadian\
  \ fur trappers called them bad lands to travel through. I thought I had seen the\
  \ best of it all until I drove around a bend and came to a stretch of green grass\
  \ at the end of the day. The sun was just setting over these fields of spiralling,\
  \ steep cliffs. As the fading light fell on the undulated surface, it softened what\
  \ had seemed menacing structures in the daylight.\n\nIn the span of two days, I\
  \ was surprised to discover magnificent natural landscapes, intriguing history,\
  \ and friendly people in the USA. I had heard that 50% of Americans apparently don't\
  \ own passports. I started the road trip wondering why it was the case. And now\
  \ I think I caught a glimpse of why the average American wouldn't leave their country.\
  \ For one, it's more affordable and easier to travel with a car as a family. For\
  \ another, the landscape is already so varied - you can do and see a lot without\
  \ leaving. \n\nOn this road trip through 12 states, I least expected to discover\
  \ such awe-inspiring beauty in South Dakota. I would've missed it if I had listened\
  \ to the fear-mongering stories about the USA. I would've also missed it had it\
  \ not been for needing to charge my phone at McDonald's. Even though I'm not American,\
  \ any time people apologize for mistaking me for one, I'll take it as an opportunity\
  \ to educate them on the beauty of this nation."
