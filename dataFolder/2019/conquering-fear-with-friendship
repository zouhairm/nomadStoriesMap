Text: "Stepping out of a two year relationship and onto a plane halfway across the\
  \ world alone seemed like a somewhat illogical logical move. What better way to\
  \ escape the memories and the heartache than to leave it all behind in search of\
  \ adventure and new memories right? Anyway, a one-way ticket from Melbourne to London\
  \ and three nights in a hostel was booked. It wasn\u2019t the most well thought\
  \ out plan but it was the best plan I had. \n\nI arrived at my hostel at 7.00am\
  \ to a dorm room full of darkness and people sleeping. I put my bags down and sat\
  \ on my bed. Not knowing what to do next, I just buried my head in my hands, thought\
  \ to myself \u201Cwhat am I supposed to do now?\u201D and just burst into tears.\
  \ The lack of planning had backfired. For all the exciting adventures I envisaged,\
  \ I had no idea how to make them a reality. I don\u2019t think the tears were over\
  \ anything in particular, but the culmination of an emotionally overwhelming situation.\
  \ The idea of being fresh off a break-up in a foreign city on the other side of\
  \ the world with no friends or family once seemed like a great idea. Now it seemed\
  \ like my worst nightmare. \n\nI didn\u2019t want to stay in the room but I didn\u2019\
  t know where else to go. My first thought was of course to go get food, so I found\
  \ myself a cheap traditional English breakfast. I came back to the room a couple\
  \ of hours later to find strangers awake and chatting away. My plan was to walk\
  \ over to my bed, put some headphones in and try pass the time, however my plan\
  \ wasn\u2019t to be. Before I could even get to my bed, I was greeted by one of\
  \ the guys in the room and invited to join the conversation. He asked where I was\
  \ from, what I was doing in London and where I was off to next. We all chatted and\
  \ laughed for some time when eventually they asked me what my plans were for the\
  \ day. I told them I had none and they said the same, so we all headed off to explore\
  \ London. Together.\n\nWe spent the day exploring everything London has to offer;\
  \ Big Ben, Tower Bridge, Buckingham Palace, London Eye, Westminster Abbey, The Shard,\
  \ Oxford Street. You name it we saw it. Come night time we prepared for a big night\
  \ out in pubs and clubs across London. It only seemed fitting that following a day\
  \ I\u2019ll never forget was a night I\u2019ll never remember. What I did remember\
  \ though was the immediate friendships I had developed that would continue to last\
  \ to this day.\n\nI woke up the next morning to a familiar sight. The same dark\
  \ room. The same sleeping people. However things could not have been more different.\
  \ Feelings of sadness and confusion were replaced with happiness and a sense of\
  \ adventure and belonging. So I woke up every morning for the next 3 months with\
  \ the biggest smile on my face and each day that smile grew bigger knowing that\
  \ my decision to cross the globe and venture into the unknown had been one of the\
  \ best I\u2019ve made in my life."
