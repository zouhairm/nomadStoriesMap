Text: "I am a Mediterranean woman, like the women of Croatia, Portugal, France, Montenegro\
  \ and others. But I've known by chance that I was very similar to Spanish women.\
  \ On my last year trip to India, where people are very kind and always accost you,\
  \ the first question they'd asked me: Are you Spanish? \nI've become sure of it\
  \ when I wandered through the streets of Alicante, the first European city my feet\
  \ have ever walked in. Everyone I encountered talked to me in Spanish, not only\
  \ because they don't like speaking English but because they thought I was one of\
  \ them.\nThe first reason that pushed me to speak to a large number of people is\
  \ that I've always got lost; perhaps I am the only girl who gets lost in Alicante.\
  \ As if a mad compass moved my feet in the wrong directions, but in Alicante no\
  \ matter how you got lost you will never afraid, the safety that people carry in\
  \ their eyes can make you feel that whenever you stare at someone you reach your\
  \ destination. This thing as far as is marvelous and resting as far as brings sadness\
  \ to a deep point in my heart, when I remember the fear that follows every step\
  \ I take in my country: Syria. I search for safety under the rubble of houses and\
  \ defeated souls, and I found nothing.\nI've always thought that I had pet phobia,\
  \ but in Alicante even the dogs don't scare me. I've recently discovered that this\
  \ phobia I thought was not related to animals, but to all that walks on the earth\
  \ where I belong, which should protect me according to its basic nature as a homeland,\
  \ but it doesn't. \nA few years ago, I saw \"Live Flesh\" film by the Spanish Pedro\
  \ Almod\xF3var. There is a quotation from the last scene that has caught my neck\
  \ and hasn't released it yet: \n\"I know how you feel, I was in the same position\
  \ 26 years ago, but you are more fortunate than me. See the situation is different\
  \ now, see to the sidewalk is full of people, when I was born there was no one on\
  \ the street, the people were in their homes afraid, fortunately, we have quitted\
  \ fear many years ago\"\nSpain which was 26 years before the quote is Syria today.\
  \ I don't know if I would have the opportunity to say such a sentence to my child\
  \ one day, the child who makes me think every day if it is a sin to give birth to\
  \ him in the war country?\n\nI have a small part of a poem:\n  This happens since\
  \ I saw \"The Disappearance of Garcia Lorca\" film\nI feel nostalgic for the war\
  \ of the guns that I hadn't known\nA sentence Lorca said kept ringing in my head\
  \ for a long time:\n \"I will not let them gain my fear\"\nO Lorca, I wave my fear\
  \ as a white flag\nAnd they haven't killed me yet\"\nI visited Granada, to track\
  \ the shade of dear Lorca. I found a charming city that captures the heart and never\
  \ releases it. \n\nBecause I am the only girl who gets lost in Alicante, it is normal\
  \ to get lost in Granada, I walked and walked until I arrived at his house. I didn't\
  \ need a well-known language to feel that Lorca was writing a play here, and from\
  \ this window, he looked at the tree with yellowish leaves and wrote a poem. On\
  \ this stove, he made cups of coffee. And his fingers touched the keys of this piano\
  \ with the same tenderness that his words touched his lovers all over the world,\
  \ including me. In one of the nearby hills, bullets passed through the body of this\
  \ beauty. \nSome of my ancestors may be lived in Granada some 600 years ago, leaving\
  \ behind them great architectural and philosophical heritage. If history had changed\
  \ a little bit, Granada might have been my hometown as well, then it is not strange\
  \ that people around the world suppose I am Spanish, and not strange that I saw\
  \ my Syrian friends in the faces of beautiful Alicante girls"
