Text: "When I say I haven't travelled yet, people somehow think I haven't lived. That\
  \ my life is somehow devoid of magic, and that my soul is still blank and shallow,\
  \ my eyes not yet opened to the world.\n\nThis could not be further from the truth!\
  \ \n\nMy name is Amy, and all my life I have lived in New Zealand. It is my home.\
  \ It is familiar to me, like my own face in the mirror.  I grew up campervanning\
  \ around the South Island with my grandparents every holiday. Mountains and plains,\
  \ lakes, forests, hot pools, geysers, glaciers, rugged coastlines, sandy beaches,\
  \ and fjords. New Zealand is one of the worlds most spectacularly beautiful tourist\
  \ destinations, and it was all in my backyard.\n\nI was a self employed dressmaker\
  \ in Wellington, the capital city, for 12 years. It is a small city, but super diverse\
  \ and cultural. Its a laid back, colourful little city, with vibrant, friendly people,\
  \ great cafes and epic shopping. It was my home. I knew everyone, and I had explored\
  \ every corner. From my window box in the middle of Cuba Street in the city, I watched\
  \ all the daily comings and goings, and I was quite content.\n\nBut in 2016 I was\
  \ diagnosed with aggressive breast cancer, due to a previously unidentified hereditary\
  \ illness. I had to endure four months of gruelling chemotherapy, a month of radiation\
  \ and undergo a bilateral mastectomy and total hysterectomy. By the end of 2017\
  \ I was fully cleared and recovered, but my perspective on life was becoming radically\
  \ different.\n\nMy home now felt small and claustrophobic. I found myself reaching\
  \ out for new people and new experiences. Festivals, raves, psychedelics, dates,\
  \ sex, adventures... I found myself gravitating towards travellers and nomads. These\
  \ were the best experiences: exploring my own home with new eyes, with foreigners\
  \ who were on their own epic journeys. \n\nI started questioning myself. Why was\
  \ I still so deeply rooted at home? I had always enjoyed making my nest at home,\
  \ collecting all my fashion and art and craft stuff. Knowing everyone and networking\
  \ deeply in my local community. Saving my money fastidiously.\n\nBut now life took\
  \ on a more urgent taste. My belongings became a weight around my neck, and my lifestyle\
  \ felt monotonous. I was cured of my cancer yes, but a cure is never a guarantee.\
  \ I am aware that my chances of living to retirement aren't optimal. At 35 years\
  \ old I  I am reaching the end of my youth. I can always earn more money, but I\
  \ can never be young again. \n\nSo in November last year I sold all my belongings\
  \ and purchased a round the world trip. I took only a few weeks to decide and plan\
  \ to do it. And I put it in action. I leave two weeks from today, and am I scared?\
  \ No way! Excited? A little. But it's long overdue. \n\nMost travel writers are\
  \ seasoned travellers, but I have not yet travelled. Why I am travelling now, is\
  \ not some sudden desire for foreign mountains, valleys, lakes and forests, but\
  \ a desire to explore people. The people are the key. I am surrounded by some of\
  \ the world's most epic natural beauty, but what is more infinite in its beauty\
  \ are the people I have met. When I'm dying one day, the memories of one mountain\
  \ versus another mountain... not really significant. It's the unique and beautiful\
  \ people who are the true wonders of the world!"
