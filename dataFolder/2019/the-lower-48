Text: "I always dreamed of seeing the country by car. \n\nThe spark was lit during\
  \ childhood road trips, when the landscapes outside the window magically shifted,\
  \ unveiling a surreal pastiche of natural and cultural treasures. It was further\
  \ fueled through reading, poring over endless atlases and personal stories of adventures\
  \ near and far. Although the world at large held great appeal, something about the\
  \ distinct\u2026 weirdness of the United States always intrigued me. Somewhere around\
  \ middle school, I made a plan: see all 50 states before I turn 30. I wasn\u2019\
  t sure what the route or logistics would look like, but that milestone fixed itself\
  \ in the back of my mind, faint but insistent.\n\nIn the summer of 2017, I was in\
  \ a rut. I had just returned to Minneapolis from a six-week European adventure (cliched,\
  \ I know, but what you gonna do?) to no job, a relationship on the rocks, and a\
  \ general lack of fulfillment.. Getting the incredible opportunity to travel solo\
  \ overseas had reminded me just how much I loved exploring, learning about new cultures,\
  \ feeling the earth beneath my toes and tasting history in the air. The prospect\
  \ of going back to a settled life from that was daunting, to say the least. Then,\
  \ two days after I got back, I attended a reading by the great Terry Tempest Williams.\
  \ She was promoting her new book \u201CThe Hour of Land,\u201D a beautiful meditation\
  \ on our country\u2019s national parks and her intimate relationship to them. As\
  \ I heard her speak about these vast, powerful landscapes, I was reminded of a dream\
  \ from the not-too-recent past. For most of college, I had planned to celebrate\
  \ my graduation by visiting several parks to celebrate the National Park System\u2019\
  s centennial. While I didn\u2019t regret the decisions I made, those wild lands\
  \ still haunted my mind, beckoning me towards them. That suppressed desire - coupled\
  \ with a genuine fear of what might happen to such beautiful spaces thanks to environmental\
  \ erosion and an intolerant political administration - combined with Williams\u2019\
  \ narrative to provide a full-force revelation. Hard though it may be, it was time\
  \ to go. And I had to do it alone.\n\n\tFrom October 1st, 2017 to October 9th, 2018,\
  \ I went forth and saw America. Combining the national park trip with the 50-by-30\
  \ goal, I packed my little Honda Fit to the brim and set out on a zigzagging, vaguely\
  \ square-shaped tour of all the lower 48 states. I camped, couch-surfed, used the\
  \ occasional hostel or motel, and slept in more Walmart parking lots than I could\
  \ have ever imagined. Going solo had its daunting, lonely, terrifying moments, but\
  \ it also afforded me the opportunity to mold the trip into something specific and\
  \ special. With no competing schedules or obligations, I was free to roam, learning\
  \ on the road, seeing things I\u2019d only dreamed about. \n\n\tOstensibly, the\
  \ trip was about seeing the national parks, with eclectic attractions and history\
  \ running as close seconds. Over the course of the journey, additional themes revealed\
  \ themselves: civil rights, homegrown museums, main streets and bookshops. All together,\
  \ it created a hodgepodge American experience - uniquely mine, as it can be uniquely\
  \ everybody\u2019s. \n\n  I had the privilege of spending time in many of the most\
  \ beautiful places on Earth: Yellowstone and Yosemite, the Olympics and the Arches,\
  \ Big Bend, the Smokies, the Everglades. I wandered into Canada three times and\
  \ Mexico once.I walked the streets of San Francisco, Washington, D.C., Burlington,\
  \ and Cleveland, and found unexpected treasures in each and every one. I saw the\
  \ real-life town of Sleepy Hollow, the shores of Walden Pond, and the homes of Zora\
  \ Neale Hurston and Jack Kerouac. I roamed through immersive Burning Man exhibits\
  \ and saw my first Ku Klux Klan outfit.  Driving through the Utah desert, I once\
  \ passed between two dead cows, lying in identical poses on either side of the road.\
  \ I made new friends and reconnected with many, many old ones. Perhaps best of all,\
  \ I finally got to see America in context. I got to see the best of the country\u2019\
  s past and future, and the worst. It was an imperfect experience, but a deeply necessary\
  \ one."
