Text: "Since I was a child, my dream was travel to Africa. This fact can be explained\
  \ by my origin: besides being black woman, my country, Brazil, was built by slaves\
  \ from Africa. \u2018We have african culture in the blood\u2019 is the strongest\
  \ fact that I have learned in my life. \n\nSo, in 2017, I was there, in Africa,\
  \ knowing a totally different way of living, of wearing, of eating, of drinking\
  \ and, (surprise!), of walking. By the way, let me talk about the last topic: I\
  \ haven\u2019t imagine that, in some cases, the way of walking can determine where\
  \ you are from. When I arrived in Africa, I heard it from some african guys: \u201C\
  you are brazilian! We get along with a lot of brazilians here and we can see a brazilian\
  \ guy in the other side of the country. You love dancing and walking in the same\
  \ time\u201D. It was my first cultural shock (but, it\u2019s awesome to have an\
  \ opportunity to know how the world sees you). \nYou probably are wondering about\
  \ the country I went. So, now, I am going to write from the beginning. On December\
  \ 14th, around 13pm, I was going off to Marrakesh, in Marocco.\n\nWhen I arrived\
  \ there, Sayd, the guide, was waiting a group of students, including me. In that\
  \ moment, my heart was happy, because I was afraid and without internet connection.\
  \ Therefore, from that moment, we all got along with. Because of the different culture\
  \ and chauvinism, it\u2019s not a good idea non-local women walking alone there.\
  \ Knowing about this, we always did everything in group. As much as you disagree\
  \ with something, you accept be in a different culture, so, you have to respect\
  \ the rules \u2013 the most important lesson I\u2019ve learned travelling. \n\n\
  During the trip, everytime I had a reason to be impressed. Everything was different\
  \ comparing with occidental culture: the buildings had clay color, every women wear\
  \ long clothing (you could only see their eyes). The men wear old-fashioned clothing\
  \ and they were always drinking a tea in cups similar to Aladdin\u2019s ones. In\
  \ the streets, cars, chariots, limousines. We passed in front of a castle; where\
  \ the Marocco\u2019s King lives. In the principal square, a big confusion: I saw\
  \ snakes, monkeys, people dancing and red light. The big truth is: no matter where\
  \ you are in Marrakesh, everything was always reddish. \n\nIn that day, we slept\
  \ early because a long road trip to Sahara Desert was waiting for us in the next\
  \ day. Before the sun shined, we are awaked. I jumped out of bed and got dressed.\
  \ \n\nAfter 14 hours on the road, we arrived in the desert and we knew Berber people,\
  \ who is born and live in Sahara. Every moment some guy comes close to me, take\
  \ off my sunglasses, looked at my eyes, analyzed my body, my hair, my teeth and\
  \ asked to other one: \u201Chow many camels would you give for this girl?\u201D\
  . And the scene was repeated with more, at least, ten guys.  After a moment, someone\
  \ explained me that how much more \u201Cbeautiful\u201D the woman was, more camels\
  \ she \u201Cdeserves\u201D. Besides of that, I heard: \u201Cshe is brazilian! More\
  \ and more camels!\u201D. I didn\u2019t say anything, but I felt like an object.\
  \ \n\nI would like to write an important thing in this letter: when I decided to\
  \ go to Marocco, I opened my mind to the new things that I would passed through.\
  \ Everything would be different and I knew about it. However, I also knew that the\
  \ black brazilian women\u2019s stereotype is one of the strongest one in the world.\
  \ Some of them looked at me by a sexual way. \n\nBut I have to say: Marocco taught\
  \ me a lot. I got a tattoo written \u201Cshokran\u201D, which means \u201CI am grateful\
  \ for something\u201D. They use to use this word for many things, like: when they\
  \ look at the sky, when they meet friends in the street, when they say goodbye to\
  \ someone. \n\nSo, when I said goodbye to Hassan and Sayd, moroccans who cared about\
  \ me during the trip, I hugged them by a \u201Cbrazilian way\u201D and said \u2018\
  Shokran forever\u2019. Travelling alone to Africa was worth."
