Text: "Every time I get the metro to the airport it rains. Not drizzle. Biblical,\
  \ tsunami-sounding rain. The kind that hammers through your jacket onto your soul.\
  \ \nHe walks me to the station. My mother told me to never talk to strangers. But\
  \ there\u2019s something different about this one, as he says goodbye. \n\nAthens\
  \ is a city teetering on the brink of extinction by modernisation, hanging off the\
  \ edge of the world. Exarchia, my neighbourhood, is the exposed nerve ending that\
  \ leads directly to the heart of the city. I\u2019ve lived here six months. Every\
  \ now and then, some violent injustice will trigger a reaction, send the helicopters\
  \ over Acropolis. We broke onto the roof of our apartment building one afternoon\
  \ in October but we don\u2019t go up on these nights for fear of being spotted,\
  \ our status as innocent bystanders misinterpreted.\n\nThe anarchists, usually so\
  \ divided, have united in the face of this common enemy. They talk till the early\
  \ hours of the morning in empty buildings dimly lit by fire-spinners about how they\
  \ can stop the gentrification and protect the integrity of this neighbourhood they\
  \ love so dearly. \nAnd who can blame them? Walking down Exarchia\u2019s painted\
  \ streets I feel the sudden urge to call them home. They feel familiar to me despite\
  \ the fact that they are unknown, strange like the curve of the hips of a stranger\
  \ bared to me for the first time, on the first night.\n\nYou can never see so many\
  \ stars in cities, but you can usually see the moon.  \nTonight I look up and the\
  \ moon is gone, disappeared behind a dense white fog that hangs on my neighbourhood\
  \ like tar, serving as a visceral reminder of all the wrongs committed in these\
  \ streets, past and present. I leave my apartment and immediately start crying.\
  \ Tear gas ruins your eyeliner.\n\nIt\u2019s 9pm on a Saturday night. It's also\
  \ the anniversary of a boy's murder by police, the day of the annual riot. The bars,\
  \ usually full of people making music and getting drunk, have become safe-houses\
  \ bursting full with regular citizens trying escape the thick cloud of tear gas.\
  \ These streets I know so well have turned orange with bonfires burning bright like\
  \ cars set alight with the anger of a thousand people. They are not my people, but\
  \ I feel their anger. I\u2019m wearing their flag. These streets are now a war zone.\
  \ The trees from the sidewalk are dragged to the middle of the road to block the\
  \ cops from moving north. I walk past them and a man in a balaclava asks me which\
  \ way they were headed.\nIt is then I realise that this city is on fire.\n\nThrough\
  \ the fog I see the grinning face of a friend running towards me. \n\u201CWhat\u2019\
  s a nice girl like you doing in a place like this?\u201D he jokes. \nWe decide to\
  \ leave and go meet a friend in a bar a mile away, but trying to get out of Exarchia\
  \ is a struggle. Fireworks are thrown down a different side street every few minutes,\
  \ and each time people shouting in a language I don\u2019t yet know tell us to get\
  \ out of the way. It\u2019s beautiful like jazz, chaotic symmetry creating more\
  \ chaos.\n\nRunning away from explosions with the bittersweet energy of a beatnik\
  \ poem whose author died long ago, we shamble down these streets like we\u2019ve\
  \ been doing our whole lives. We\u2019re crying but we\u2019re laughing and it's\
  \ with smoke in my hair and tears in my eyes that I realise this city is the man\
  \ I love. \n\u201CYou English people bring the rain,\u201D my friend says as he\
  \ lights up a cigarette. We've stopped running. \u201CThat\u2019s what we need.\
  \ Some rain. Tear gas dissolves in the rain.\"\n\L\u201CI can do a rain dance?\u201D\
  \ I offer, and he smiles. We dance in the middle of the street in the middle of\
  \ the riot. Minutes later, I feel the rain on my forehead and for a second, we\u2019\
  ve won.\nBut the war won\u2019t end. Next year they\u2019ll rehearse another revolution.\
  \ No one ever wins, and no one truly loses. \nAll that's left to do is dance, dance\
  \ in the rain."
