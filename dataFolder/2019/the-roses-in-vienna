Text: "The day before I was set to leave my student exchange position in Leeds, UK\
  \ to backpack across Europe, my grandma passed away. Instead of beginning my trip\
  \ I went home to say goodbye a final time. She'd been one of the strongest women\
  \ in my life; a scrabble champion, an incredible editor, and an enthusiastic gardener.\_\
  \n\nI joined my friends in Italy after the funeral, knowing that she'd never want\
  \ me to miss that trip. But the grief didn't really hit me there\u2014it was still\
  \ too unreal.\_\n\nThat was until I got to Vienna.\_Everything about Vienna seemed\
  \ clean, immaculate, beautiful. Even the most basic of buildings were constructed\
  \ with gorgeous architecture to give the city a unique aesthetic.\_\n\nMy third\
  \ day in Vienna stands as one of the most memorable stays of my two-and-a-half-month\
  \ trip. I woke up mid-morning with an empty stomach and no desire to eat the hostel\
  \ breakfast of cereal and toast. So I went in search of a cute cafe instead.\_\n\
  \nI didn\u2019t find one. Instead, after walking a number of blocks in the gorgeous\
  \ June sun, I stumbled onto a kind of cycling celebration. There were delicious-smelling\
  \ food trucks but nothing was quite what I was looking for\u2014what I really wanted\
  \ was a hot dog\u2014so I settled for a glass of white wine. \n\nAs I kept walking,\
  \ I came to a grand and open park with all colours of flowers arranged amongst trimmed\
  \ hedgerows. The sun, bright green grass, and clear blue sky made the pinks and\
  \ reds of the flowers stand out. Along the paths in the park were rose bushes of\
  \ all kinds and shades\u2014easily over a hundred of them. I walked along the winding\
  \ paths between them where a few other people mingled, enjoying the ambiance.\_\L\
  \nMy first thought was of my grandma, despite the fact that roses were never her\
  \ favourite. She preferred blue and purple flowers like lilacs, snapdragons, and\
  \ morning glories. But in that field, surrounded by roses of every colour imaginable,\
  \ I knew that even she would have been awestruck. The scene brought me back to the\
  \ times I\u2019d helped her in the garden, pulling up weeds while she pointed out\
  \ what to pick and what to leave. I could imagine her gesturing at the flowers surrounding\
  \ us, using her walking stick to show me what she\u2019d keep and what would look\
  \ better somewhere else. \n\nAlong one of the rows of bushes I found a bench to\
  \ sit on as tears welled up behind my sunglasses.\_The grief hit me in one motion,\
  \ bringing me from a place of happiness and light to one where I knew something\
  \ was missing. The loss of her became palpable when I realised that I could never\
  \ tell her about the roses I\u2019d found in Vienna. That her garden would now grow\
  \ without her.\n\nThe rest of the day continued in that same vein of wonder and\
  \ amazement. I found the Vienna Pride celebrations (where I finally got a hot dog),\
  \ saw an installation of Richard Wright\u2019s art in the Temple of Theseus, explored\
  \ old churches, and walked stone streets. Vienna continued to surprise me with beautiful\
  \ experiences, each one unique and riveting in their own way.\n\nI'll remember that\
  \ day forever. I'll remember Vienna forever. I'll remember the love and the sunshine\
  \ and the colours, the carved buildings and smell of wood. I'll remember that day\
  \ because, even though she was gone, I had felt the presence of an unforgettable\
  \ woman."
