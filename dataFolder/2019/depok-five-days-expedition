Text: "Within five days (between the 7th and the 11th of February 2019) I went and\
  \ settled in the city of Depok, Indonesia. My travel activities there I named \u2018\
  Depok Five Days Expedition\u2019. This is inseparable from personal awareness based\
  \ on rationality of mind and soul that I must go and settle in a city outside of\
  \ my hometown, Semarang City, to practice adaptability and the ability to survive\
  \ in a city with a different culture of society. One thing that is certain, the\
  \ departures plan, settles, until returns must be programmed systematically through\
  \ the determination of the timeframe according to personal needs and readiness.\
  \ \nOn the first day of my trip there, I got a friendly welcome from my best friend\
  \ from Bengkulu. The position of our bond of friendship isas a fellow alumni event\
  \ competition held by The Faculty of Geography at Gajah Mada University three years\
  \ ago. We discussed and shared ideas about the dynamics of the campus environment\
  \ where we studied. It did not stop there, we also discussed and shared ideas about\
  \ the priority of structuring a self-competency improvement program called \u2018\
  Achievement Student\u2019 along with other important things we had done during college.\n\
  Special note for the second day of my trip there, I met my best friend from Jakarta.\
  \ The position of of our bond of friendship is as a fellow alumni of ZeniQA\u2019\
  s mentor (Official Zenius Reseller). Our meeting was indeed very short (about fifteen\
  \ minutes). Nevertheless, discussion sessions and sharing ideas between us are very\
  \ valuable. For the first time, I met face to face with someone who same personality\
  \ and character as me. The discussion is related to the dynamic of campus and job\
  \ environment very comprehensive. Related to the competition and scholarship projects,\
  \ he knows how to fight for it (exactly he way that I fight for it). More than it,\
  \ a topic of discussion is about \u2018Tips and Tricks for Towards an International\
  \ Level as a Student\u2019 which is a mandatory mission renewal`this year also produced\
  \ very satisfying results. My best friend provided extraordinary input and tips\
  \ considering he was used to going abroad as a university delegation to attend international\
  \ level student conferences. \nOn the third day of my trip there, I attended the\
  \ Indonesia University open socialization to the public called \u2018UI Open Days\
  \ 2019\u2019. That said, the program was the strongest reason why I launched a personal\
  \ program called \u2018Depok Five Days Expedition\u2019. Through the event, Indonesia\
  \ University offered a variety of educational programs that were very interesting\
  \ for the millenial generation who wanted to continue their studies there. Diploma,\
  \ Bachelor, Extention, Profession, Specialist, Masters, until Doctoral education\
  \ programs are socialized at the event. I took part in the socialization of the\
  \ Master\u2019s education program offered by Indonesia University to obtain more\
  \ detailed information about the Masters in Middle Eastern and Islamic Studies.\
  \ \nNext, on the fourth and fifth days, I got a friendly welcome from my best friend\
  \ from South Tangerang, Banten. The position of our bond of friendship is as a fellow\
  \ alumni of Semarang State High School 1 and our almamater National Science Olympiad\
  \ Group. We have the same thing in terms of the process that has been passed since\
  \ joining the National Science Olympiad Group until study in the college level.\
  \ Related to the competition and job environment, he is very fun to be invited in\
  \ this discussion and share ideas. The most special thing about him in my opinion\
  \ is he offers a relatively simple but functional value in various ways. Examples\
  \ of using goods that are owned, financial management, until interact on social\
  \ media. I must admit that it inspired me to bring a better resolution of life after\
  \ this personal program ended. \nIt was time for me to end the series of personal\
  \ programs called \u2018Depok Five Days Expedition\u2019on the fifth day and return\
  \ to Semarang to prepare the first day of college activities. During thewent back\
  \ trip until arrive in Semarang, \u2018Depok Five Days Expedition\u2019 really made\
  \ me able to forge myself into a prestigious person who is ready to bring myself\
  \ towards a better direction."
