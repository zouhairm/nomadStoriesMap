Text: "The first time I saw an Orange tree, I was delighted by seeing so many of my\
  \ favourite fruits hanging from the same tree. Or maybe, my delight was fuelled\
  \ by my thirst.\n\nIt was afternoon and I was walking outside Bir, a small village\
  \ hidden in the Kangra valley of the Himalayas. Arguably India\u2019s most scenic\
  \ paragliding destination, it is also home to beautiful Tibetian monasteries and\
  \ learning centres.\n\nMy own paragliding experience over the green meadows, crisscrossed\
  \ by a beautiful stream, had left me awestruck. I wondered if I could go for a dip\
  \ in the stream myself. A short chat with a villager near my paragliding landing\
  \ site revealed that it was just a 15 minute walk. \n\nAfter walking for around\
  \ 30 minutes as directed, I asked another local who told me I was in the right direction\
  \ and should reach the stream in 10 minutes. I wondered whether I was so slow at\
  \ walking uphill as compared to the local villagers. Or maybe both, the 10 minute\
  \ & 15 minute answers were not an actual measure of time. Just a phrase to indicate\
  \ that it was a walkable distance.\n\nI was now parched with thirst but wasn\u2019\
  t carrying my usual backpack or the water bottle in it. All I could see were small\
  \ stone houses, separated from each other by shrubs and trees. It was then that\
  \ I saw my first Orange tree.\n\nThe tree was in a courtyard next to a small house.\
  \ I walked towards it and saw a woman, maybe in her 60s, washing some clothes near\
  \ a tap in the courtyard. I greeted her with a smile and told her that the Oranges\
  \ looked delicious. I asked if I could taste one. She smiled, nodded a yes and offered\
  \ to pluck some ripe ones for me. I wondered what would be a fair price for the\
  \ fruits and gave her a 20 Rupee note. She gave me a look of incomprehension and\
  \ I figured that she was acting uninterested because I was offering too less. I\
  \ took out a 50 Rupee note from my pocket and offered it to her. Embarrassed, she\
  \ took the note from my hand and shoved it back in my pocket.\n\nShe invited me\
  \ to have a seat on a wooden cot placed in the shade of the same tree and asked\
  \ me if I\u2019d ever eaten a \u2018Malta\u2019 or should she show me how to? She\
  \ explained that these orange coloured fruits were not exactly Oranges, but a local\
  \ variety, somewhere between a Tangerine and a Mandarin. She peeled one from the\
  \ freshly plucked ones and I saw that the peel was almost 3 times thicker than an\
  \ orange peel. She asked me to eat one of the inner slices and took another herself.\
  \ As I put it in my mouth, I was overcome with a rush of sourness and moaned with\
  \ disbelief. She laughed, put a piece in her mouth and laughed some more as the\
  \ sourness hit her. She then took a small piece of the peel, chewed on the inner\
  \ layer and signalled me to do the same. I followed her instructions and found that\
  \ the peel actually had a soft chewy layer which balanced the sourness of the juicy\
  \ inner segments very well. You can eat both the parts as per your preferred taste.\n\
  \nWe ate the remaining fruits in silence enjoying the sourness and the view of the\
  \ valley. As we were about to finish, she asked me if I wanted to eat some more.\
  \ I thanked her but said that I should start walking to the stream so that I can\
  \ swim for a while and then head back to the village, before sunset. She told me\
  \ I should stop again on my way back so that she could give me some Maltas to take\
  \ back with me. I promised her I will and she came to see me off outside her house.\n\
  \nShe asked me if I knew which way to take. I pointed in the direction and asked\
  \ in a playful tone, \u2018It\u2019s just a 10 minute walk right?\u2019\n\nShe smiled\
  \ and told me that I was absolutely correct."
