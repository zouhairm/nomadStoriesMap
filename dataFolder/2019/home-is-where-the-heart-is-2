Text: I lived in Geneva the country of Swiss Alpes for 2.5 years and travelled across
  to different the length and breath of the continent. I went across to different
  countries and explored different cities and their unique culture. Last year when
  I returned back to my home country ie India.I started missing European way of life.Right
  from the food,culture,language & historical cities,snowy mountains,beautiful lakes
  etc.No amount of whatsapp messages,video calls compensated.Therefore in order to
  get over this phase I decided its important to discover my own country and went
  onto exploring Kerala with my family.Its called god's own country and considering
  my paternal family stayed in Kerala for a few years I thought its a good idea to
  trace my roots.We went to Munnar,Kochi & the backwaters of Allepy.It was a beautiful
  experience staying so close to nature and running away from the chaotic city life
  of Delhi.That's when I bumped into a few of my batch mates from Europe and that
  was a surprise for me.We starting talking and catching up.Out of the blue I noticed
  them relaxing on the beach.Thats when I figured I have left a part of my heart in
  Europe while I like to stay close to my roots.
