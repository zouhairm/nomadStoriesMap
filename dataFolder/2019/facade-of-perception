Text: "I\u2019ll always remember the look on her face, as though I were making a joke\
  \ in poor taste or lacked the words in her language. It was a typical day at the\
  \ school where I taught in Costa Rica. The mountain air was clean and refreshing.\
  \ The sun was shining brightly, not betraying a strong rain that was, as always,\
  \ a near certainty later that afternoon.   \n\nMy placement was near the center\
  \ of Ciudad Quesada, one of the larger cities in the mountainous, northern province\
  \ of Alajuela. A short drive by van, the school was nestled in the midst of quiet\
  \ farmland. The next door neighbors, a herd of cows. Escuela Caimitos was an elementary\
  \ school where I taught English for the students in kindergarten, first, and third\
  \ grade.\n\nClasses finished for the day, I was chatting with Do\xF1a Mar\xEDa,\
  \ principal of the school. My Spanish was passable, but not so good as to prevent\
  \ regular misunderstandings or lengthy pauses. Our talks tended to cover a few regular\
  \ topics, the school, personal information about myself, and life in our respective\
  \ countries.\n\nToday it was the last topic that defined our conversation. I told\
  \ her of my home in New England, where the weather was so very different and varied.\
  \ Life bustled and people rushed here and there, bound by the hands of the clock\
  \ like the strings of a puppet master. Life flowed differently in the tranquil mountains\
  \ and valleys of her home; people relaxed and got there when they got there she\
  \ would tell me. \u201CTico time\u201D my group\u2019s leader would affectionately\
  \ call it. \n\nThis phrase had a bigger meaning than the lack of punctuality that\
  \ was the norm here. Life was slower paced, something to be enjoyed and not stressed\
  \ over. \u201CPeople are poor here, but they are happy\u201D Do\xF1a said. They\
  \ certainly were happy in my experience. Costa Rica is a rarity. In many countries\
  \ the armed forces are a central part of identity; Costa Rica has none. Costa Rica\
  \ also has universal healthcare, a well known fact in neighboring countries, as\
  \ people emigrate from Nicaragua and other nearby nations.\n\nWhile Costa Rica has\
  \ a distinct identity, it\u2019s also easy to feel America\u2019s sphere of influence.\
  \ Tourism and the effect of American society are commonly felt. American culture\
  \ is prevalent in the form of movies and television, fast food restaurants, and\
  \ public perception in general. \n\nBased on American media, it\u2019s easy to imagine\
  \ how people there might view the US. While some movies and TV shows show the difficulties\
  \ Americans face, media often focuses on the rich and the famous. This view is therefore\
  \ prevalent in other countries.  When Do\xF1a told me Costa Ricans are poor I couldn\u2019\
  t help but think of a comparison point in my life. \u201CWe have many poor people\
  \ in America\u201D I told her. \n\nA mixture of surprise and doubt occupied her\
  \ expression. \u201CNo\u2026\u201D she said simply, as though I had erred in some\
  \ way. This surprised me in turn, as I realized she had probably never heard something\
  \ to that effect. I paused for a moment, changed the topic to something mundane,\
  \ and we resumed conversing normally.\n\nHer reaction has always stuck with me.\
  \ To this day I\u2019m not sure if I should have said anything, or if there was\
  \ an appropriate response. The topic didn\u2019t arise again while I was there.\
  \ The summer came to a close and I said goodbye to the teachers, students, and my\
  \ fellow volunteers. Life carried on in the same peaceful fashion at Escuela Caimitos;\
  \ the little school in the hills."
