Text: "One Day On The AMAZON\nThe first is what is floating in the  OROBO river of\
  \ symbolic \"Dream diving boyish in the Amazon\". The Black color of the OROBO river\
  \ gives it a unique feature, the reason for the acid and its salts and plants  are\
  \ close to some of the waterfalls. Participate with him in this feature of the Rio\
  \ Negro River . More than swim in this river is also charming and enjoyable torrential\
  \ tropical rainfall and repeatedly. While we praise the children who do not go out\
  \ of the water of the beaches during the holidays to eat or play in the sand,  to\
  \ prepare ourselves to go to the middle of the forest because we will spend the\
  \ night there, in the pool, to the sounds of the monkeys and insects monsters in\
  \ the darkness ... the center of the jungle. The Amazon forest is the last remaining\
  \ natural indigenous land if we take into account the vast size, which covers 40%\
  \ of the area of Latin America\nThis Forest of central importance in the environmental\
  \ balance to furnish the oxygen supply and content of trees, plants and animals.\
  \ A study published said that Amazon has more than 360 billion trees from 16000\
  \ class and birds from the 1300 class and thousands of species of reptiles and millions\
  \ of species of insects. Marco  a 46-year-old, is married and has four sons, known\
  \ as the large area of the forest surrounding the OROBO river known as his sons.\
  \ Ancestors of the indigenous forest, spent decades of time to learn their ancestral\
  \ culture and way of life and has a special relationship with the Amazon Forest,\
  \ considered by or land close to dying. When I asked Marco Do you prefer to live\
  \ in the city of  rio de Janeiro or Sao Paulo in the surroundings to provide \"\
  security\" and \"security\", or to live in the jungle in a way of life of their\
  \ ancestors, he said: \"If you want to live in the city then accept any profession\
  \ in order to live, if you're lucky and found a career suit my cultural, all this\
  \ in order to guarantee the daily sustenance and strengthened my children at the\
  \ center of many congestion and anxiety and pollution. I am pleased now in the Amazon,\
  \ my nature does not enable me to go to another place because the relationship of\
  \ the mother of her son, give me any thing I want and gives me security and safety\
  \ to talk about it. If you are hungry go to hunt, fish or enter to the center of\
  \ the forest in order to bring some food from herbs or corrupt animals so hungry\
  \ and want to sleep, I attach the inspiration as you will see when anywhere in the\
  \ jungle And I slept, so no benefit to go and work in the city in order to give\
  \ the unavoidable circumstances have in return for little money to lose on food\
  \ to eat and shelter to sleep in.\" I wanted to ask him questions in this context:\
  \ Go your scholar back to attended. The night is long in the middle of the forest\
  \ and we'll talk about all what you want there \nA bunch of annoying ideas I bring\
  \ bed kits in the middle of the Amazon jungle: hammock \"your inspirations\" or\
  \ dress that we hang on the trees, ropes, thick pants, raincoat, trekking shoes,\
  \ mosquito repellent, some fruits and a small bottle of water. These ideas mixed\
  \ in the ratio of occurrence of possibility that burning me any kind of reptile-anacondas\
  \ or algararaka who live in the jungle \u2013 water or animal that killed a local\
  \ resident last year through the possibility of death Guide \"Josie\" a heart attack\
  \ or stroke as die suddenly. \nMany people around the world (150000 attack per year\
  \ in Brazil alone)\nDeath of \"nutty\" means naturally impossible out from amid\
  \ the jungles of the largest forest in the world. \"Josie\" who spent half his life\
  \ learns lifestyles and survival and survival in the jungle we acknowledged that\
  \ he doesn't realize only 2% or less of the Amazon secrets \u061C"
