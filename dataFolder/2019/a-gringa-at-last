Text: "Despite having moved to Canada at the young age of nine, I never considered\
  \ myself Canadian. In a country where everyone is constantly in the jolliest of\
  \ moods and no one seems to ever raise their voice, I have always stood out as a\
  \ feisty hot-headed character. Having come from a developing nation with a harsh\
  \ reality most Canadians can\u2019t even imagine, growing up, I felt continuously\
  \ frustrated with their overly positive naive world view; their way of forever thinking\
  \ the entire planet is capable of being the best of friends. \n\nOver the years,\
  \ nostalgia repeatedly led me to return to Brazil. Each time I exit the S\xE3o Paulo\
  \ airport, I sink into my comfort zone, softening at the sight of the unchangeable\
  \ chaotic streets of my hometown. From the nonstop honking expected in a metropolis\
  \ with twenty million inhabitants, to the garlicky aroma of rice and beans steaming\
  \ somewhere just before lunchtime, to the teenage boys by the viaduct selling cheap\
  \ bikinis, without a fail, each aspect consistently embraces me like I never left.\
  \ \n\nUpon arrival, I sat alone in my aunt\u2019s living room while everyone still\
  \ slept. I then vowed I wouldn\u2019t bring up politics on this trip. I was there\
  \ to surprise my cousin for her fifteenth birthday, while also staying for Christmas\
  \ and New Year\u2019s. I had no intention of ruining my vacation just because my\
  \ aunt and uncle, along with most of the population, had recently voted in a controversial\
  \ figure at best, a misogynistic homophobic fascist at worst, for president.  \n\
  \nNo matter how many times I pleaded, it was obvious the main item on everyone\u2019\
  s agenda was to convince me they had made the right decision. I was forced to sit\
  \ through endless speeches where I was repeatedly told how prior to this election,\
  \ we were headed for a Venezuela-like economic situation, how the level of violence\
  \ experienced daily had never been this high. Someone with a military background,\
  \ who encouraged police brutality to fight crime, was just what the doctor prescribed.\n\
  \nDuring the next two weeks, I resisted the urge to pull the hairs out of my head\
  \ as I regurgitated once more my views on the matter. Regardless of what the previous\
  \ government might have done, to me, there was no excuse for raising to power an\
  \ individual who climbed his way to his new position by demonizing vulnerable communities,\
  \ spreading hate about anyone who dared cross him. \n\nWhenever I voiced my opinions,\
  \ I was presented with the same analysis. I am a \"gringa\", they would say, a foreigner.\
  \ From my privileged developed-world residency, how could I possibly know what Brazil\
  \ needed? \u201CYou have a small-minded Canadian view of things\u201D, my once dear\
  \ aunt concluded. Being branded a \"gringa\" stung me at first. Towards the end\
  \ of my stay, the label was coming out of my own mouth. \n\nAs the 38th president\
  \ of Brazil stepped up to the podium to begin his inauguration speech, I took a\
  \ deep breath in, closing my eyes to avoid looking at my family. After a few moments,\
  \ I allowed relief to take over. I would be on a plane home the following morning."
