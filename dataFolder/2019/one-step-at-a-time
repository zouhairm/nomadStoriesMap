Text: "It was the night before my big trip. I was anxious, excited, and terrified\
  \ all at the same time. I would be boarding a flight the next morning that would\
  \ take me all the way from Connecticut to San Diego, but it wasn\u2019t the flight\
  \ that had me nervous. It was the trail. I would be setting out on an adventure\
  \ to hike 2,650 miles of the Pacific Crest Trail. I would be walking the entire\
  \ length of the U.S. West Coast. The next five months would be filled with memories,\
  \ hard work, and every unknown factor I could think of. I sat there thinking about\
  \ how it all came to be, how I wound up in that very position. I wanted it for so\
  \ long, and it was finally in front of me.\n\nThe early morning was filled with\
  \ mumbles from my parents and I as we weren\u2019t quite sure what to say. I did\
  \ not want to leave in that moment, yet I knew I would regret my decision if I were\
  \ to back out. I packed up my belongings and was shuttled to the airport by my father.\
  \ Walking inside alone, I knew that was it. There was no turning back. I was going\
  \ to be embarking on an adventure of a lifetime, but I couldn\u2019t get myself\
  \ to feel elated just yet.\n\nI arrived in San Diego looking for my ride to Scout\
  \ and Frodo\u2019s. Two trail angels who previously thru-hiked the trail years ago\
  \ offered to thru-hikers a place to stay the night before leaving for their journey.\
  \ They were kind and welcoming, and every bit of what I needed in that moment. Dozens\
  \ of us filled their home, snacking on every piece of food we could get our hands\
  \ on, hydrating for the next day to come, and chatting with each other about gear\
  \ and mileage. It was surreal. I read about this place countless times and yet it\
  \ was different than I imagined. With new friends by my side, I was actually able\
  \ to get some rest that night.\n\nWe all packed into multiple vans in the morning\
  \ to be shuttled off to the Southern Terminus. Each one of us would begin our journey\
  \ at the border of Mexico and continue North until we reached Canada. It looked\
  \ so far on my map. One foot at a time, I told myself. The desert air was hot and\
  \ the snakes were already rattling. A few photographs were snapped at the monument\
  \ and then we were off.\n\nFive months and 2,650 miles later, it was the best gift\
  \ I could have ever given myself. It\u2019s comical to think how afraid I was at\
  \ the beginning. I keep asking myself why. Stepping into the unknown brings about\
  \ an array of feelings. I was terrified I would fail. I was anxious to be alone.\
  \ I was panicked to think about everything that would be thrown my way that I never\
  \ experienced. Upon reflecting, I now understand what comes after those feelings.\
  \ It is in that precise moment that I knew I was making the right choice and that\
  \ my life and perspective would never be the same again."
