Text: "I had always dreaded returning to the Manila\u2014capital of the Philippines,\
  \ my home country\u2014for many reasons. The endless traffic, suffocating smog,\
  \ pickpockets, the stench of dead rivers and urine that was everywhere. This was\
  \ my perception of the Philippines. Polluted, dirty. I never believed it when people\
  \ told me about the untouched nature, the beaches, the forests, the fresh air.\n\
  \nSo, in November 2017, when I returned home for the first time in years, I decided\
  \ it was time to find the beauty in the country of my birth.\n\nI asked around,\
  \ where should I go? What places should I see?\n\n\u201CCoron,\u201D was the general\
  \ answer. \u201CYou need to go to Coron.\u201D\n\nCoron. It is a small island part\
  \ of the Palawan province. Underdeveloped, normally ignored by tourists in favor\
  \ of more popular islands, like Puerto Princesa.\n\nTrusting their accounts, I booked\
  \ a four-day trip for me and my sister, complete with hotel and a tour package\u2014\
  just in time for my 22nd birthday. \n\nI was pleasantly surprised. As we climbed\
  \ out of the sixty-seater plane, salt filled my nose though there wasn\u2019t a\
  \ beach in sight. Only forests and fields.\n\nOur hotel\u2019s driver was waiting\
  \ for us, among twenty other coaches waiting for their guests. Coron consists of\
  \ one main town and a dozen smaller islands. During the 40-minute drive to town,\
  \ I observed the landscape the rolling hills, stray dogs running down the road,\
  \ coconut and plantain trees, bamboo huts in the fields. Greens and more greens.\
  \ Endless greens. \n\nThere were no cars except for hotel transport.  Every store\
  \ we passed sold life-jackets, swimsuits, waterproof phone protectors, and sandals.\
  \ \n\nOur first tour started in the afternoon, with our tour guide picking us up\
  \ in a rickshaw he operated with a motorcycle. He toured us around Lualhati Park,\
  \ the town plaza and souvenir shops. We climbed 780 steps up Mt. Tapyas and watched\
  \ the sunset around us. Then, to unwind after so much walking, we took a dip at\
  \ the famous Maquinit hotsprings. \n\nThe next morning, we ate a traditional breakfast\
  \ that brought tears to my eyes. Dried fish (danggit) with salted eggs and fried\
  \ rice, exactly what I used to eat as a child. \n\nI spent my 22nd birthday on seven\
  \ different islands that day. On a motorized outrigger boat, we went from Kayangan\
  \ Lake--the cleanest lake in the Philippines--to Twin Lagoon, where I snorkeled\
  \ for the first time in my life. On the sandy white shores of Beach 91 we were treated\
  \ to a buffet lunch consisting of the crabs and prawns, skewers of sweet barbequed\
  \ pork, salted eggs, and seaweed-grapes. We spent an hour around Sieta Pecados,\
  \ where salt and fresh water combined to make alternating waves of warm and cold\
  \ temperatures; and the Malwawey reef, snorkeling among schools of clownfish. \n\
  \nThat night, we had a birthday dinner in a Filipino restaurant. I ordered sinigang,\
  \ my favorite soup made of tamarind and pork and vegetables, while my sister took\
  \ a risk and ordered sizzling octopus and eel. She loved it. \n\nOn our third day,\
  \ we visited three different beaches on three islands, making our day feel less\
  \ rushed. On Banana Island, we took our beach blanket, laid it next to a palm tree,\
  \ and sat under the shade watching crystal waters roll back and forth on the snowy\
  \ shore. We had another buffet lunch and met fellow Filipinos visiting from abroad\
  \ and exploring their country for the first time. \n\nOur final destination was\
  \ bulog dos island. We were lucky enough to catch it in low tide, where its well-known\
  \ sandbar was there for us to cross. My sister and I took selfies, we recorded videos\
  \ around the beach and sandbar. While she went to explore, I returned to the water,\
  \ letting fish approach my floating body without fear. I looked at the pristine\
  \ water, the clear blue sky, the endless island greens, laughing tourists, the bubbly\
  \ tour guides. \n\nAnd I found myself falling in love with my country. Just like\
  \ that.\n\nThat way, when we returned to Manila and felt the dizzying smog on our\
  \ faces, smelled the urine and dead rivers, I was able to sit back and remind myself...this\
  \ isn\u2019t all there is to see."
