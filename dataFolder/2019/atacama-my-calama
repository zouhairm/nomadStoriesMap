Text: "The day by day routine was wine. And street food. But mostly wine. The wine\
  \ from Chile is all over South America and it is one of the best. It is affordable.\
  \ I paid 1600 Chilean pesos for 1.5l. That\u2019s like 2$. Bellavista *district\
  \ in Santiago* was the occasional stop every 4 nights or so. All the big action\
  \ was in the hostel. La Casa Roja. Red because it was so full of life! Every night\
  \ chillaxing with Jote \u2013 wine \xBE & coke\xBC. In Spain they call it Kalimotxo.\n\
  I couldn\u2019t afford to stay longer than 3 weeks and so I started to travel. I\
  \ had no idea where I was going, but I knew I was a rookie traveler because I had\
  \ too much luggage.2 bags.\n\_\nTerminal. Checking the prices for buses and choosing.\
  \ Calama City is the best offer. I\u2019ve always wanted to go to Atacama Desert.\
  \ I don\u2019t know, it\u2019s been like a calling. I can go as far as to say that\
  \ in my dreams, aliens asked me to go there and that\u2019s how I came up with this\
  \ idea of\_Travelism. Maybe I was supposed to find a sign or something. And the\
  \ sign came! From the driest desert in the world it became the wettest dessert in\
  \ the world, so wet that San Pedro de Atacama had floods.\n\_\nBut no matter what,\
  \ Atacama Desert it is out of this World. I do not have pictures from Atacama, just\
  \ memories. 24 hours by buss, and no battery on camera. In the night but mostly\
  \ in the daylight. You know the pictures from Martian Rover? That\u2019s Atacama.\
  \ Imagine this:\nyou fall deep asleep then suddenly twitch after someone tries to\
  \ wake you up. You open your eyes and there you are\u2026 in the first row on the\
  \ 2nd floor in a bus. A bus that is going on a road, in the middle of fucking nowhere\
  \ and as you look out the window all you can see is this huge hand emerging from\
  \ the desert.\nMario Irarr\xE1zabal was the one  who would have done it at the request\
  \ of the authorities. For me, it meant loneliness, just a hand, trying to get out\
  \ of an impossible environment, or to save itself from a hostile environment. Or\
  \ ... simply hand to high five !\nArrived in Antofagasta, a city of about 2 million\
  \ people, I met the Pacific Ocean. Wonderful as you descend from the mountains and\
  \ see the city on the hills above the ocean. See a brown hue from the hills and\
  \ the city and a strong blue ocean that blends with another blue sky. A strictly\
  \ industrial and tourist area. We stayed for 2 hours to change the bus to Calama.\n\
  \nNear Calama there is a place called San Pedro de Atacama, a town often visited\
  \ by tourists for the surrounding recreation areas. Geysers, sand dunes, minerals\
  \ / rocks in bizarre shapes. You can rent a bicycle and visit the area very easily.\
  \ I have seen many videos from my friend. But I did not get there. I would have\
  \ wanted to go, but I did not have much money and I preferred to stay for 2 nights\
  \ in Calama\nAbout Calama, being a dessert city in the world's driest place, it's\
  \ easy to understand that it's not raining here. It is one of the driest cities\
  \ in the world. Every two years or once a year. The fact is that when I was in this\
  \ city, there were floods. It rained so hard that they had closed the border with\
  \ Argentina because in the mountains the snow was 6 meters tall. 4-5 July 2016 you\
  \ can look up the climate stats. \n\nA strange city, at the entrance of which she\
  \ writes \"La ciudad del cobra\", with a jail in the middle of the city with a barbed\
  \ wire and a 5 metre  fence. \nPeople had more faces, more personnas and they looked\
  \ like they all want to get the clothes out of you. Or maybe it was my impression\
  \ because I was a tourist, but it seemed. But just looking. No one came to disturb\
  \ you, but they looked at you as though they were."
