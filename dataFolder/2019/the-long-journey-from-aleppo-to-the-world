Text: "The bombings voices outside were louder than our voices inside, the electricity\
  \ was cut for two months in a raw, and my family and I were setting in the hallway.\
  \ It was one of many fearful moments in Aleppo. Five years of endless frightening\
  \ and lost hopes. \n\u201CThis is the time\u201D: my father said, and I knew that\
  \ this was the moment that all our lives will change. My father is a faithful, wise\
  \ man and he always wanted us to seek for a better life and new opportunities. This\
  \ was the moment where he encouraged us to pack our bags to leave our house. Five\
  \ years into the Syrian crisis we have not left my beloved city \u201CAleppo.\u201D\
  \ Now we have to for our safety, dreams, and mainly for our lives. Packing a small\
  \ bag is the hardest thing that I have ever done in my life. How come that I can\
  \ pack 23 years of hopes, happiness, joy, sadness, memories into one bag! I had\
  \ to take my official documents and a few pieces of souvenirs from my family. \u201C\
  Oh God\u201D I desperately said, \u201Cit does not fit even my basics!\u201D how\
  \ can I leave my country behind without carrying pieces of memories, love, and nostalgia.\
  \ These pieces are me! \nLife inside my country was brutal, but outside it was cruel.\
  \ I took the road for the most dangerous journey that I have ever been through.\
  \ I took a final look at my family house and kept a USB full of photos. \nIt was\
  \ such a hard thing to leave our country \u2019s, not only because of the battles\
  \ but also because we were not able to get any VISA even to the nearest countries.\
  \ I held my passport in my hands and looked at it is saying, \u201Chow can all my\
  \ humanity be abstracted in a piece of paper that could take me to nowhere!\u201D\
  \ My father with his wise words told me that your identity is not in this paper;\
  \ it is inside your head and heart. Your hardworking through your life will get\
  \ you out of here, and your degree will be your passport. He was right! I got my\
  \ most fantastic opportunity and left the country to Hungary to pursue my second\
  \ degree. This was a tremendous opportunity that I could not even imagine.\nBudapest\
  \ is a charming city with a very long history. It is such a resilient city that\
  \ reminds me of Aleppo. After all, the hard times that Budapest has been through\
  \ it became now one of the most beautiful destinations for tourism in Europe. I\
  \ had to experience the European culture through my time in Hungary. I admired the\
  \ open borders and easy traveling time that I have spent there which on the contrary\
  \ reminds me of the hardships that I have been through to reach our neighboring\
  \ countries.\nExchanging knowledge and receiving support from my colleagues in Budapest\
  \ gave me a new perspective and helped me to crystallize my ideas. I have to say\
  \ that my traveling\u2019s experiences were an eye opener for many things and helped\
  \ me to reach a stage of inner peace and helped me to refigure myself. \nThe ERASMUS\
  \ year that I spent in Budapest was almost over, and I wanted to pursue a master\u2019\
  s degree. I kept applying to study the field that I liked. I found a fantastic opportunity\
  \ in the united states. I was so excited about it, but again I heard my father\u2019\
  s words again which implemented hope for me. Now I am sharing this story while I\
  \ am at Northeastern University in Boston, MA. \nMy journey taught me many lessons\
  \ and increased my hope for my passion. I wanted to share my experience with many\
  \ people so I can implement hope for hope seekers, exchange knowledge, and transfer\
  \ experience."
