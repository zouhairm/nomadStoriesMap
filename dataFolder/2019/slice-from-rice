Text: "A grave silence struck at workplace and we step out for a chai (tea) to relax\
  \ our fuming heads. It is November and much to surprise a scorching hot afternoon,\
  \ seemingly strange indication to a not called for rains. The floods in October\
  \ (wave of disaster and loss struck this God\u2019s own country in 2018) had barely\
  \ recovered circumstances in the state of Kerala. And here we were munching fries\
  \ to steaming Irani tea. Tongue twister pronunciations as it goes in Malyali- Pazzambpuri,\
  \ sweetened fries of ripened bananas dipped in all flour were being fried in huge\
  \ open to the sky vessel on the streets. This place already had caught toil of labour\
  \ as meat getting layered, pierced through a  rod prepping for sizzling shwarma\
  \ \n\nThe life here have normalised against the buzzing media clippings that popped\
  \ collages to juxtapose images on news channel, and circulated on whatsapp,  facebook.\
  \ They say, Malyalis reside almost every state in the country before they get back\
  \ to their own house only retirement on. Proud owners to this green belt of the\
  \ south India, a cosmopolitans junction is Fort Kochi. Myths, fables and awe inspiring\
  \ anecdotes comes part and parcel of this so to say- communist state. I was greeted\
  \ as warm like most tourists in this place. \n\nMajority of Muslims, Christians\
  \  occupy this street of Kunnumpuram in Fort Kochi known for making chicken/meat\
  \ shwarma rolls, meat biryani, meat bonda (ball). Thriving place that  fry banana\
  \ chips, fries packed, stacked in dozens on shelfs of bakeries in congested neighbourhood.\
  \ Every lane serve rejuvenating local savoury dipped in coconut oil, coconut squeezed\
  \ milk, grated and garnished grates of tender coconut topped to spicy curries. Coconut\
  \ is synonym for Malyalis. Might turn a curse to non-Malyali sometimes. Blending\
  \ and oozing an aroma that crosses cultural and religious borders. \n\nDormant flavour\
  \ of  jaggery and coconut stuffed in  steamed rice flour when wrapped in banana\
  \ leaf absorbs and settle into my  gut subsiding and forming a chemistry accompanied\
  \ to an Irani chai was gratifying as it melted on my tongue to smoothly pass the\
  \ tensed air in time. Feeling an  immense gratitude to food in front on the platter\
  \ for the unlikely loss of rice harvest this season washed to turmoil of earth conflicted\
  \ among nature. Lucky Star, a local restaurant weaves a condensed network of Keralite\
  \ essence to our slice of flaring time transitioned to chirpy noises of birds to\
  \ this evening."
