Text: "It's 2013. We stepped out of the Cuttack Railway Station with heavy luggages----big\
  \ loaded suitcases and terrified pounding hearts. From a group of seven dancers\
  \ only four reported at the current location.\nThe event organiser running with\
  \ a bouquet of flowers, our tour senior Tanushka, two of the other members, the\
  \ running train; the fiasco was too unexpected not to crash my mind every second\
  \ that we walked out of the half-lit muddy station grounds. To our utter surprise,\
  \ a Toyota Fortuner stood embracing our failure, welcoming us into the capital of\
  \ Orissa.\n\n13th of November we had began our journey from Howrah Station, loading\
  \ luggages beneath the 3A seat racks of our train wherefrom our seats belonged.\
  \ Seven multicolored multisized suitcases under three seats: two facing each other\
  \ towards one end of the compartment and, with all pleasure the most travel-experienced\
  \ dancer took one isolated side lower berth to peacefully spend Coelho-ing her way\
  \ to Jajpur Keonjhar Road.\n4 hours and 50 minutes by Google Maps prediction. The\
  \ usual hodge-podge of different subjects and their awkward paraphernalia brought\
  \ in by the myriad vendors speaking all possible dialects of Hindi and Bengali:\
  \ the two popular local languages. \nPartings were never happy; neither parents\
  \ from their children nor awkward nerds from their usual peaceful home of lonesomeness.\
  \ As we paced through the probabilities of the universe, the sky gaped at us as\
  \ if aware of the fate ahead in time, pulling in the sheath of darkness from the\
  \ East. \nThere is a always a difference between travelling solo and in a group\
  \ of varied ages and experiences. Nearing our destination to around half an hour\
  \ we started nudging away lethargy. Debanjana and I chatted along on the upper bunk\
  \ while Sarangi, on the other upper berth had been busy finding something. Prakriti\
  \ was busy combing her locks blocking out three suitcases in a row. She being a\
  \ senior wouldn't listen to our words except for Tanushka who was nowhere to be\
  \ seen. In that very moment we heard Ananya rushing in for help: Tannu(Tanushka)\
  \ was vomiting. I immediately leaped towards the washroom zone with a bottle of\
  \ water. I was sure it was food poisoning, strangely enough I saw Ananya wink at\
  \ me! Or maybe pregnant?\nWithin all of these jeopardies Debanjana screamed \"Girls\
  \ we're pulling in, hurry up\". What we weren't aware of was that Jajpur is a very\
  \ local small station hardly of much importance with respect to passenger relay\
  \ or even vendor business. So midnight stops were unofficially shortened here. 60\
  \ seconds. Sharp.\nThe rest happened as fast as cyclone against time. Suitcases\
  \ screeched from underneath the seats in a squeezy space where only a single person\
  \ could stand behind another. Movement was slow. The family before Ananya, the first\
  \ one in our line, took maybe half a minute to go down on the platform. Ananya went\
  \ down, pulling down her heavy luggage as fast as she could. Some distance in the\
  \ dark platform I could see the geeky organiser rushing in with flowers greeting\
  \ Ananya while she helped Tannu down the stairs. Sarangi had my suitcase, I had\
  \ hers to avoid more confusion. However Prakriti was slow as ever. First down went\
  \ her baggage then she went down wasting more time while the train already started\
  \ moving forward. I couldn't lunge forward Sarangi's huge Traveller and in that\
  \ second I was almost about to leap off when Debanjana grabbed my bagpack. Sarangi\
  \ was still inside while Issani was absolutely left out, forgotten.\nWatching the\
  \ sun grazing the Eastern horizon through the silent window, middle seat of the\
  \ cruiser, I could imagine our Guru's burning face while calling me unprofessional.\
  \ I knew she wouldn't understand the hastles of travelling by train in India. But\
  \ I wouldn't deny, the organiser's stressed face while he ran alongside the pacing\
  \ train as if he would catch me like a hero, and Tannu's  perfect squat while screaming\
  \ at me not to jump off, were all possible because I tried to leap off. \nFrom the\
  \ front seat Issani just turned to take my attention, 'Happy Children's Day baby.\
  \ We won by majority stakes'. We happily missed a station. A fresh dawn, breathtakingly\
  \ beautiful."
