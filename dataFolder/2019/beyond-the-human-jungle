Text: "The tree fronds were like blinds framing a saturated jungle into which our\
  \ small Klotok boat plunged head first, its engine churning like an unstoppable\
  \ story into a heart of darkness. It had been 4 days since we got on the boat; myself,\
  \ my guide, the boat driver and the cook and already I was beginning to feel a warm\
  \ sentiment for my generous hosts who I spent late nights with watching the ephemeral\
  \ dreaminess of fireflies, nibbling grilled banana and musing over our respective\
  \ jungles within which we lived. The filth day would regretfully be my last.\n \
  \  We were in Tanjung Putting National Park on the island of Kalimantan in Indonesia\
  \ on a nautical adventure searching for the orangutans for which Borneo was famed.\
  \ As well as crocodiles, and panthers, and gibbons, and tarsiers, and snakes and\
  \ in fact, some 50% of all living animal species which were native to Borneo. Gazing\
  \ above at the canopy of intertwining vines strangling the trees while winding through\
  \ the ominous waters, I felt humbled to witness the inimitable power of nature.\
  \ \n   The orangutans were graceful, majestic creatures yet childlike and playful\
  \ as they gave young shrieks and inspected the peculiarities of various toys on\
  \ the forest floor, only for a Gibbon to come sweeping down in a shot from the trees,\
  \ snatch it and then sit smugly above them, while the Probiscus monkeys with their\
  \ drooping noses and pot bellies resembled indifferent grandparents, sitting their\
  \ days away taking care of one another.\n   But it was not until the last day that\
  \ I would realize my greatest discovery would come not from this exotic soup of\
  \ biodiversity but from something more familiar; humans. \n   Upon one of our forest\
  \ treks, we got to talking about the negative effects of the palm oil industry on\
  \ the biodiversity in the region and I found my guide was rather determined when\
  \ it came to his opinion on the matter. He began to tell me that, for some, the\
  \ work offered by the palm oil industry meant being able to put shoes on their children\
  \ and send them to school. I told him that I had read that the local people were\
  \ exploited by companies and it wasn\u2019t sustainable. He stood for a moment and\
  \ thought, then asked me why I had wished to come here. I said enthusiastically\
  \ that I had always dreamed of exploring the jungles of Borneo. He then offered\
  \ me the opportunity to explore deeper and go somewhere he didn\u2019t normally\
  \ take the visitors to which I said of course!  \n   The last day of the expedition,\
  \ we embarked upon a long 2 hour journey, deep beyond the layers of tree fronds\
  \ and murky waters, along a dusty road. All along the way were fields of palm oil\
  \ plantations, half constructed roads and the occasional stray dog. As we traveled\
  \ further away from the exotic scenes, we got closer to a human\u2019s habitat.\
  \ \n   Finally in the distance I heard the sounds of young shrieking voices and\
  \ scampering feet; a playground. A herd of children welcomed me. Upon signing a\
  \ dusty old register, I noticed that the last visitor had visited more than 6 months\
  \ ago. The teachers balked at my blonde hair and ushered me into the classroom expecting\
  \ I had a wealth of expertise in English teaching, to which I met with a compelling\
  \ rendition of \u201CHeads, Shoulders, Knees and Toes\u201D. The children applauded\
  \ and praised me as if I were a celebrity, urging me to show them my camera and\
  \ let them take pictures. \n   Their awestruck faces cast me back to my own awestruck\
  \ face which gazed upon the Orangutans the day before. And as I watched the children\
  \ rejoicing at the peculiarities of my camera, each waiting for their turn, I realized\
  \ how beautiful they all were. My guide told me that if it weren\u2019t for palm\
  \ oil plantations, this school may not be here. I nodded at him and smiled, humbled\
  \ by the children ready for a group photo."
