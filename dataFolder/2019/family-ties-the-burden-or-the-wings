Text: "Since the very young age the outside world of mine consisted of one and the\
  \ same route \u2013 the way to my granny. Maybe it\u2019s your grandparents live\
  \ somewhere around the corner, to get mine one had to change two buses to cover\
  \ the distance of minimum 5 km on foot one way. The same story was with coming back\
  \ home. My mum used to visit her parents in such a way once a week on Sundays. Keep\
  \ in mind the name of the village which had stolen all the weekends and holidays\
  \ of our family \u2013 Novokursk, Dnepropetrovsk Region which is in Ukraine.\nOur\
  \ usual Sunday looked like that: mum got up at about 5 a.m., cooked food for her\
  \ parents, after that we took a bus, then one more bus, finally we had to go on\
  \ foot and carry very heavy bags. The journey used to be tough: it was always too\
  \ hot on summer days and extremely slippery and bitterly cold in winter. After leaving\
  \ the grandparents\u2019 house at 3 p.m. my favorite part of the trip began: exhausted\
  \ though always in a hurry not to miss the bus we had to go down the steepy hills.\
  \ Naughty pebbles scattered away from underneath our feet, we could fall down and\
  \ sometimes we did. It was only looking at a still surface of the river with its\
  \ sparkling water, bushy banks, a loosely-spreading willow and lots of cows, horses,\
  \ sheep grazing the grass on the meadows that could make us smile. If nobody was\
  \ around I stretched my arms like the wings of the plane, my feet were walking faster\
  \ and faster and then I began to run and scream at the top of my lungs. It seemed\
  \ I was gonna take off! At that very moment I felt absolutely happy.\n Till the\
  \ age of fifteen I had no devices to take pictures of the most picturesque rural\
  \ spots so my eyes substituted for the camera. I did not want the most memorable\
  \ moments to fade away so I often figured my fingers in a special way as if they\
  \ were my camera and made lots of imaginary snaps. Years passed, I became a student,\
  \ then finished the University, began to work, went abroad, came back and began\
  \ to study again at the second University. Meanwhile parents and granny became older\
  \ and older. So much new happened to us, so much changed, except one thing that\
  \ knew no changes: our Sunday visits to my grandparents. I liked it, I hated it,\
  \ still I tried to do my best. The path leading to my grandparents\u2019 house taught\
  \ me being patient, caring, trained my power of will, annihilated my weakness. Everything\
  \ we used to do was always done in the name of Love as there is nothing else as\
  \ precious in this life as family ties. \nOnce when I wanted to take a picture of\
  \ my favorite scenery with my smartphone, I felt I outgrew all I used to love before.\
  \ It seemed that the grass was trampled down, the river became shallow and even\
  \ the hills looked not so high as before or maybe it was I who grew it all out.\
  \ Not having noticed, from a child who could fly I turned into an earthling. \n\
  Our family ran that marathon during decades. In August 2016 at the age of 100 years\
  \ and three months my granny passed away. First time for the last 50 years the habitual\
  \ roads met my mum no more. Since that time a 33 year-old me and my mum who is 72\
  \ years old now go to the village only to take care of grandparents\u2019 graves.\
  \ By taxi and it costs filthy much. When we drive along the river, I wonder how\
  \ fast that steepy pace can be covered. I look at that old-shoe scenery but use\
  \ camera no more. I do not want to capture moments, compare them with the memories\
  \ of how amazing it was, I just wanna look and live that familiar feeling. Like\
  \ in childhood when I least expected to find freedom while covering that familiar\
  \ path but was absolutely free."
