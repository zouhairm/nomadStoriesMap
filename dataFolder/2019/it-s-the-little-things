Text: "I find myself sitting next to an older, Chinese couple 30,000 feet in the sky.\
  \ We don't speak each other's languages and we sit ever so awkwardly trying not\
  \ to touch knees on the 16 hour flight ahead. I keep double checking my bag to make\
  \ sure I didn\u2019t forget anything at the terminal and all the zippers are zipped.\
  \ I take a large gulp from my water and swallow my sleep aid and attempt to get\
  \ comfortable in a seat made for efficiency. As I\u2019m nervously trying to get\
  \ my headphones to work, blow up my neck pillow, and straighten my compression socks,\
  \ I look over to find the sweet woman next to me resting her head gently on her\
  \ husband\u2019s shoulder. His head is laid on top of hers like they\u2019ve done\
  \ so many times before. In and out of sleep, they eat, whisper, and smile at one\
  \ another. I yearn for a connection as pure as theirs and a sense of composure as\
  \ unwavering. I take a deep breath and try to relax. My mind begins to wander. As\
  \ I sit there wondering what decisions and life choices they made that lead them\
  \ up to this point and all the stories their sweet faces hold, I doze off. A couple\
  \ of hours later, as if she knew my heart, the planning, and all my qualms about\
  \ this upcoming trip... the blessed woman taps my arm gently and offers a homemade\
  \ Chinese pastry she has packed in her bag. A pastry different than any other I\u2019\
  ve had. This pastry was given with love, gentleness, and peace. I\u2019m certain\
  \ that although we don\u2019t speak the same language or even come from the same\
  \ continent she could tell this was a small yet significant moment for me. This\
  \ darling pastry was originally meant for someone dear to her yet she shared this\
  \ precious gift with a stranger. A stranger we are often quick to become annoyed\
  \ with during a long haul flight. A stranger we avoid eye contact with and unknowingly\
  \ roll our eyes at. A stranger we complain about later to a friend. A stranger that\
  \ we don\u2019t take the chance to know before judging. The woman and I end up communicating\
  \ with a smile and some babble in our own separate, but understanding languages.\
  \ My heart warms at this unexpected surprise. She set the stage for the rest of\
  \ my travels. She showed me to expect the unexpected. Be gentle, kind, forgiving,\
  \ and give grace to those different than you. I never expected to find a friend\
  \ in a woman half my height, quadruple my age, a whole world of language away, and\
  \ more cooking talent than my entire family put together. This small gesture reminds\
  \ me while we travel to explore, to absorb, and to learn about different cultures\
  \ and places, we need to open up our eyes to the person right beside us. We can\
  \ learn so much from the people we have never taken the time to see."
