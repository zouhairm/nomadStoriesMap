Text: 'Travelling into the mountains seemed to be as easy as it sounds in books unless
  you actually travel up there above the tree line.

  Yes, this is my story about trekking into the Himalayas. Two of the highest treks
  ''Sar Pass'' and ''Hamta Pass'' in the Himalayas were incredible. It was a leap
  into the unknown with many challenges coming across my way from hailstorm to crossing
  steep valleys to making myself survive in the challenging yet breathtaking landscapes.
  It was indeed an experience of a lifetime where I could have almost lost my life
  had I slipped into the river from the steep snow clad mountains. But the efforts
  and my eagerness to reach the top was worth it. It seemed like I had seen the most
  beautiful part of planet earth with tears of happiness and joy in my eyes after
  going through all the hardships that took to reach the top. I learnt a lot. I realized
  a lot of things about the journey of life. My soul was at peace. I was content.
  Probably that was the best time I had with myself. The tears of happiness and joy
  made me love myself even more and I absolutely loved the magical mountains and breathtaking
  landscapes. I met myself after a very long time away from the city chaos, away from
  the people, away from greed, away from money. It was just me and the mountains.
  No one to judge. No one guide. You are your own guide and own judge. It was an amazing
  experience I will continue to keep this journey in my heart forever and tell my
  grandchildren the stories of such a challenging and mesmerising experience.'
