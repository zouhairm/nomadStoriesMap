Text: "I longed to be on a train through the Scottish Highlands or an overnight bus-ride\
  \ bouncing it's way through the heart of America. Instead I was on the road to recovery\
  \ from Pneumonia. My travel options were pretty limited - I could walk to the local\
  \ grocery store... again, or I could ride the bus for a couple of hours. \n\nThough\
  \ I had never really noticed it before, a trip on the bus has the potential to be\
  \ a fascinating escapade. Sometimes the sound of a screaming child is almost entirely\
  \ drowned out by the clicks of a Rubik's cube completed in 42 seconds, then 41 seconds\
  \ and so on. Other times, the bus driver leads an out of tune rendition Maroon 5's\
  \ \"She Will be Loved\" and hands out backseat candy to the more unenthused passengers.\n\
  \nThe best times are when the bus unites around a common cause.  The other day I\
  \ was riding the Purple Line. It's your stock standard City to Sea vehicle made\
  \ up of clocked out workers and the kind of tourists who try to save money on their\
  \ accommodation. Two Swiss tourists were nervously arguing about the location of\
  \ their day bag. Various folk chime in with irrelevant local advice, or less than\
  \ helpful \"this one time when...\" stories. The driver became our unlikely hero.\
  \ After years of circling the city, he knew exactly where to find the bag. He lead\
  \ the passenger into an unknown building and she emerged carrying a plump red bag.\
  \ In an instant the cohort of passengers transformed from suspense into cheers of\
  \ joy. \n\nIt was just an ordinary day on the Purple Line, but for a moment we all\
  \ believed we were Adventurers, Spies and Comic book characters."
