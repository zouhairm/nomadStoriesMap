Text: "Madrid is today one of the most international and multicultural European capitals.\
  \ Immigration has played an important role in the image and the impression the city\
  \ gives you today. You can see people with Latin-American origins working in traditional,\
  \ authentic Spanish restaurants, and the opposite. Moroccan restaurants are filled\
  \ with tourists and locals during the day, but when the sun goes down they transform\
  \ into almost exclusively male hubs for local Moroccans. During the night, the Senegalese\
  \ community owns its own square, while with the beginning of a new day a queue of\
  \ people gathers to get a taste of their traditional cuisine. Locals, immigrants,\
  \ people of different ethnic backgrounds all mingle together during the day and\
  \ draw separate ways during the night. \n    From day to night, from night to day,\
  \ the never-ending circle reflects Madrid's rapid changing identity as shaped throughout\
  \ the centuries.  One would be surprised by the changing faces and different aspects\
  \ of the city. But is it really a surprise? While I was roaming in the streets like\
  \ a flaneur, I came across the placards placed by the municipality that mark century-old\
  \ businesses in the city. I invited myself in.... In casa Hernanz, the oldest shoe\
  \ shop in the city, the service was very slow, done in an old-fashioned way. Who\
  \ could imagine, that espadrilles, an almost essential part of our wardrobe, was\
  \ once used as a political statement by the Catalans? I bought my summer shoes and\
  \ nervously moved on, wondering if buying them was a wise choice. Passing by The\
  \ Kinze de Cuchilleros, the oldest barbershop, I saw a man having his beard trimmed.\
  \ In the past, that was definitely not the case for the Spanish men, who were intentionally\
  \ shaving to avoid looking similar with the Muslims. Beard only became fashionable\
  \ as a way to differentiate from the babyfaces of Latin-American men. \u0399 then\
  \ peaked a glance at Guitarras Ramirez, the oldest guitar shop in the city, which\
  \ contributed to the development of Flamenco with their handicraft guitars. But\
  \ Flamenco is the result of a beautiful fusion of Andalucian, Spanish and Gypsy\
  \ sounds. Even Madrilenian cuisine is the outcome of political, multicultural processes.\
  \ Cocido Madrileno, a specialty of all restaurants in Madrid has a funny story behind\
  \ it: it used to be part of the kosher diet of the Jewish people, who used to cook\
  \ it with eggs. During the Spanish Inquisition, people had to prove they are Christians,\
  \ so they started adding meat in their meals. And this is how cocido Madrileno slowly\
  \ became what looks like today!\n\n    Madrid is still trying to keep a balance\
  \ between modernity and tradition, past and present, while locals, immigrants and\
  \ tourists sometimes come together and sometimes draw lines of distinction between\
  \ them.  Madrid is a city that has changed many faces throughout the centuries,\
  \ and it continues to change. Just strolling down the street will let you know about\
  \ what I'm talking about."
