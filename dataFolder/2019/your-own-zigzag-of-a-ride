Text: "A man in front of me maybe in his mid 60s hastily left the zip-line platform\
  \ after completing his first run. His facial expression was one of confusion and\
  \ his complexion was pale, appearing almost as if he was lost. I overheard him say\
  \ to his companions, \u201CI don\u2019t feel so good. I am not used to this. I will\
  \ be fine, but I am done.\u201D It seemed like he was having some type of physical\
  \ issue or a bout of fear overcame him. I wasn\u2019t sure what happened to him\
  \ until later, but his group continued on the excursion. I remembered from the safety\
  \ demonstration that the first three zip-lines were described as an orientation\
  \ to zip-lining as they were short in distance and height, it was a way to get someone\
  \ acclimated and comfortable.\n\nEarlier during that thunderstorm prone morning\
  \ in September, my fianc\xE9 and I climbed the narrow and rusty truck steps into\
  \ the back of a former 1970\u2019s military open air personnel carrier. It was now\
  \ converted and being utilized for the transport of tourists during some of the\
  \ excursions in the Dominican Republic. On the way to the zip-line park, I was bouncing\
  \ around in the back of the truck on lightly cushioned and narrow benches being\
  \ loosely secured with what seemed like decorative seat belts rather than a full\
  \ on safety harness. In the truck there were tourists of varying ages who were from\
  \ a multitude of countries and possessed different degrees of physical ability and\
  \ experience.  \n\nThis was an activity I had never participated in previously,\
  \ so I didn\u2019t eat anything for breakfast to avoid any digestive related mishaps.\
  \ I had only viewed some videos and pictures of other people zip-lining from several\
  \ media platforms. The zip-lines were like an interconnected maze, resting in or\
  \ above the tree canopy with varying heights and distances. \n\nIt was a daunting\
  \ and new to me, I felt some apprehension though I am not particularly afraid of\
  \ heights and speed. There was definitely some sense of fear and second guessing\
  \ yourself. These feelings stemmed from not knowing what could happen in the event\
  \ of a cable breaking, crashing into another zip-liner on the platform while waiting,\
  \ or having the utmost trust in the zip-line proprietor that the course was safe.\
  \ To allay my apprehension, I was suited up with a safety harness, gloves, a helmet,\
  \ and given a short live demonstration of what to do if I got stuck on the zip-line\
  \ including visual and verbal signals to use in the event of an emergency. \n\n\
  From the altitude of 10 meters to 40 meters, it was adrenaline inducing to glide\
  \ through various types of scenery including streams, trees, and lush vegetation.\
  \ It was guarded freedom, knowing it would only last for a total of a few minutes,\
  \ but at the same time I felt the air rush over my body with an almost cleansing\
  \ and calming effect. The only sounds were the whirl of pulleys, carabiners clicking\
  \ as they were attached to the ropes, and the occasional audible human voice giving\
  \ instructions or encouragement. \n\nThere was anticipation for the next platform\
  \ to depart from and hopes that it wouldn\u2019t end so soon. It ended so quickly\
  \ and uneventfully. Each platform and the subsequent experience was different. I\
  \ saw many facial expressions which appeared to be of genuine happiness to seemingly\
  \ scared or at least apprehensively having fun. My fianc\xE9 even went missing,\
  \ she had jumped off an optional completely vertical free fall platform and made\
  \ it unscathed.  \n\nI did later find out that the man who left the zip-line platform\
  \ after he completed his first run was fine and just taking it easy. At the end\
  \ of the course I heard him say to his companions in an almost comical tone, \u201C\
  I had a good time, even though I wasn\u2019t able to complete it.\u201D I assumed\
  \ he felt that he had accomplished something personal and that the whole excursion\
  \ to him wasn\u2019t really about completing the ascribed full zip-line course,\
  \ but participating in some part of it and making something of the situation like\
  \ I did that day."
