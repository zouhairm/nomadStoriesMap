Text: "\"Live as if you were to die tomorrow. Learn as if you were to live forever\u201D\
  . Mahatma Gandhi\n\nHave you ever experienced the feeling of gratitude exploding\
  \ in your heart? This is how I feel about my trip to India. I arrived there unpretentious\
  \ and with an open heart, ready to learn everything I could. I agreed that I would\
  \ say YES to every opportunity. I lived every second and donated myself to the journey.\
  \ In this search for self-knowledge I dicovered that if you shut down your ego,\
  \ your judgments, your laziness, your control, your... your... your... life can\
  \ surprise you! Every day, there were a new revelation, a new moment, a new sensation.\
  \ The future and the past did not matter, I just had the present. Time has become\
  \ a great master of life.\n\nSpeaking of time, 3 months for some can be long or\
  \ short, for me, were 3 months of intense life! The Indian time is very different\
  \ from the \"other times\"! Everything has its own time. The people respects the\
  \ natural time of things: the time to eat was the time of hunger, to sleep, the\
  \ time of sleepiness, the time of our human nature. Human, we are human, not machines\
  \ which are controlled by other machines.\n\nHumans, with our best complement: Nature.\
  \ I discovered there how good it is to live surrounded by nature, even if from time\
  \ to time it surprises me with a giant spider that jumps or with tiny hairy bugs.\
  \ I've found that living with my foot on the ground is one of the best things in\
  \ the world. The beauty of the palm trees, the starry night sky, birds that do not\
  \ stop singing, butterflies carrying the message that the change makes us better,\
  \ the rain that washes our souls, the river that carries all the negative energies,\
  \ and so many other phenomena that only nature can provide us were part of the discoveries\
  \ of my journey.\n\nA dive into conscience, I will never forget the spirituality\
  \ that these people emanate. To live in the country that yoga was born, with gurus,\
  \ there is no way to return from this journay without a little extra step in my\
  \ elevation. I visited Sikh temples, Muslim mosques, Hindu temples and I left there\
  \ with the conclusion that there is something in common with all of them: love.\
  \ I think if love were our greatest guide, would not it be easier? I saw how the\
  \ people connect with their Gods and how happy they are in this devotion. A big\
  \ learning for me!\n\nI must share that I have never received so many smiles in\
  \ my life! I think it was because I looked in the eyes of each person that passed.\
  \ Every time I was on the streets I received countless smiles! And if 1 smile can\
  \ already make a difference in the day, imagine many of them! And sometimes the\
  \ smiles came with a conversation or an invitation to a tea. How can I not love\
  \ live like this? One of the issues that has bothered me most in the world is that\
  \ people do not like to listen anymore, they just want to talk, tell their stories,\
  \ their problems, seems like sharing is out of fashion nowadays. I confess that\
  \ it was strange to hear \"I love you\" from my new friends, but that's right, it\
  \ was love!\n\nYou could be asking: \"Wow! But there was nothing wrong on this trip?\u201D\
  \ Yes, of course, I had diarrhea, fever, I saw abandoned dogs, abandoned people,\
  \ a lot of dirt, a lot of poverty, places even inhuman. Everything made me reflect,\
  \ to question, so if I look at it from another point of view, I only had gains:\
  \ artistic, professional, personal, spiritual and mental gains.\n\nMy journey has\
  \ come to an end, but my learning does not, it keeps reverberating in my heart !\
  \ My next trips will not be the same, my life is no longer the same, my heart for\
  \ sure not! I closed this cycle and I still listen the words in my mind and heart:\
  \ Nandi, Namaste, Dhanyavaad, Thanks!"
