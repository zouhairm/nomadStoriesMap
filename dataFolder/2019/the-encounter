Text: "To die and to revive. To crouch in your arms and to cry out a name. Your name.\
  \  Walking the streets like a crazy dancer who lost her cavalier.\nDancing with\
  \ the rain in a beautiful tango. Counting the steps of your feet. One and two and\
  \ three. And one and two and three. \u201CAre you my love?\u201D\n\nLost in the\
  \ music that was infusing everything around me under the moon-lit sky of Aristotle\u2019\
  s Square in Thessaloniki I was walking up and down waiting for my Pashtun to finally\
  \ arrive from the airport.\n\nSwept of my feet as I were, I was making nervously\
  \ circles around the square dazzled by the hotel lights around me. I was fidgeting\
  \ from anxiousness catching the eye of strangers on me for my odd behavior. \n\n\
  \u201CWhere are you?\u201D I was mumbling to myself. Hour had passed and no eye\
  \ of him. All the worst scenarios were randomly crossing my mind triggering tones\
  \ of adrenaline in my blood leaving me the least aghast and petrified from uneasiness.\n\
  \nThat moment my phone rang. I looked around. And there he was. Standing in the\
  \ middle of the square armed with a handful of bags and luggage. Suddenly a shot\
  \ of electric current surged me at the sight of him and only then I felt the allure\
  \ of the tango music that was playing around.  I couldn\u2019t hide my bashful smile\
  \ and unconsciously I run towards him. How hadn\u2019t I noticed him before? I hugged\
  \ him tight squeezing his life out of him and gave him a kiss on his neck. His hands\
  \ were hanging in the air as if he had no idea what to do with them, what their\
  \ use was for and I couldn\u2019t help but feel charmed by his shyness.\n\nWe strolled\
  \ along the square heading at the promenade by the sight of the White Tower of Thessaloniki.\
  \ We stargazed the sea of the Thermaic Gulf and he found the chance then to hand\
  \ me two packs of Belgian chocolates he had brought for me from England. We talked\
  \ about his flight but the lit night was louder to muzzle us from the awkward answers\
  \ searching for the right words\u2026 for the unspoken words\u2026 Luckily, the\
  \ silence was interrupted by a black guy, who was selling bracelets and before one\
  \ of us stop him, he had already tied us with the colorful wristlets wishing us\
  \ \u201Chakuna matata\u201D\u2026 \n\nWe looked at each other. Smiling. My eyes\
  \ were hooked on his, at his black abyss-irises mirroring myself. I cupped his hands\
  \ in mine. The Gulf was shining under that moon\xB7 so were our dreams parading\
  \ on the silver marble waters. Sailors of a hidden love making a leap into the unknown.\
  \ Who we were \xB7 it didn't matter. Who we chose to be \xB7 it was all that mattered.\
  \ A leap into Infinity. Everything seemed to be fairytale - like. Too good to be\
  \ true. Yet true. Inevitably good. The sea, the night, the music did their magic\
  \ to scatter and blow away all the doubts and all the fears that night inherently\
  \ cherished. \n\nI stood up inviting him to a tet-a-tet dance. Somewhere from afar\
  \ that red argentine tango music was still permeating our ears. And it took less\
  \ than a second to start swaying under a red lit sky. It was a blissful starry night\
  \ knitting the East with the West under a red argentine tango. It was a truly blessed\
  \ night sprang up from a Van Gogh\u2019s painting\u2026"
