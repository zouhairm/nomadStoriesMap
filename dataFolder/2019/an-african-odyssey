Text: "I don't know how much you're familiar with the lifestyle of Kokan (a coastal\
  \ region on the Indian west coast), but that's pretty much what Africa is like.\
  \ It has abundant natural and economic resources for survival, and that's exactly\
  \ what's reflected from their lifestyle, the abundance. There's neither the urge\
  \ to be as developed as the US nor there's a sense of despair. \n\nYou'll find mothers\
  \ carrying children in a makeshift carriage of cloth, tied around their waist. Albeit\
  \ a Louis Vuitton coat. \nPeople wave their hands at you, as you pass through the\
  \ car, for their admiration and awe of the white skin complexion.\n\nIf you'll take\
  \ the road to the outskirts, you'll often find multitudes of mountains covered in\
  \ lush green grass, reflecting the glistening sunlight.\nThere are rivers piercing\
  \ through the valleys and finding their ways to ever changing scenes. As the car\
  \ passes through the villages, you'll find schools and churches at the foothills\
  \ of mountains, children running and playing in the yards of pine trees, tangents\
  \ of sunshine over there heads. \n\ni visualize myself travelling under a huge dome\
  \ of sky, expanding from one horizon to the other, I look at my fellow passengers\
  \ in the car, and I realize everyone is on his own spiritual journey, even though\
  \ we're physically together.\n\nThoughts are the destination. \n\nPlaces change,\
  \ so do the people, but one hasn't truly traveled if his thoughts are the same.\
  \ \n\nYou look at the social scene from the car window and it looks like a picture\
  \ in a story book,\nWomen hanging clothes on a rope to dry, boys grooving on rap\
  \ music on the corner of the streets with a tape in the hands, men sitting in a\
  \ garage shade drinking beer. \n\nAs I look at this scene, soft chords of piano\
  \ begin to play in my mind, and I rest the back of my head on the seat.\nI tilt\
  \ my head and adjust my sunglasses over my nose, and I look at the moving pictures\
  \ of humanity.\n\nEndless humanity."
