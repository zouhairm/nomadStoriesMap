Text: "June 2017. I came back home. Again. Even though I knew the post-traveling syndrome,\
  \ this time was different. That\u2019s because I had no idea how to accustom myself\
  \ to the daily routine when I just get back from the greatest travel of my life.\
  \ Do you know how to live ordinary after ten months of traveling by yourself across\
  \ the United States and, in the meantime, getting a master\u2019s degree in one\
  \ of the universities? \n\nBut that\u2019s where I was. At home. Without a plan\
  \ for what to do next. A place where I spent almost half of my life. Where I knew\
  \ every corner. Where nothing changed during that time I was away. Where I had so\
  \ many memories, not necessarily the good ones. The days went by, and I did not\
  \ know what to do. Stony-broke. Jobless. A little bit overqualified for the Polish\
  \ job market. \n\nAfter a while, my true nature has come to the fore. I started\
  \ traveling again. Due to financial limitations, my trips were short-distanced.\
  \ At first, I was visiting family, friends, and former coworkers. But with time,\
  \ when I was bored more than ever, I started taking trips in my region, discovering\
  \ places that I had no idea about. That\u2019s how one Sunday afternoon I discovered\
  \ Nikiszowiec, a district of Katowice which was built at the beginning of XX century.\
  \ Red bricks multi-family residences accented with red-painted window framings and\
  \ narrow streets joined by arcades were coal miners\u2019 houses for years. Surrounded\
  \ by bakeries, shops, schools, restaurant, a hospital, a pharmacy, and a church,\
  \ it was a self-sufficient and very closed district for more than half of the century.\n\
  \nAnd then I met people. Or I should say I started looking at people differently.\
  \ Ania and Ma\u0142gosia are old friends of my family. I knew them my whole life,\
  \ but I have never had the courage to ask about their story. Fascinated by Nikiszowiec\
  \ architecture and driven by the curiosity taken from other travels I started interviewing\
  \ them. As they have been living there for around sixty years fully involved in\
  \ the local community\u2019s life, I have opened a book of memories. I heard stories\
  \ of people\u2019s struggle in times when in Poland there was nothing else than\
  \ communism. I heard stories of job difficulties which was done hundreds of meters\
  \ below the surface of the ground. I heard fears from the past of women who never\
  \ knew whether her husband would return from a shift.\n\nFor the first time, I heard\
  \ stories I should have known before. I spend in Silesia for more than twenty years.\
  \ My father was a minor for forty years. Because of that, I suppose that my mom\
  \ was as scared as women from Nikiszowiec. Probably, she was praying every day for\
  \ her husband to come home from the shift in the coal mine. But I did not know that.\
  \ When I was a kid my mom never showed me her fears. And when I grew up, I have\
  \ never been interested in local history or my family heritage. It\u2019s true,\
  \ I have always been more interested in other cultures. I preferred to travel overseas\
  \ looking for inspirations from people living in San Diego, New York or Chicago.\
  \ \n\nStaying at home after the travel of my life was a very hard lesson. But it\
  \ was also the time when it hit me. I realized that the great journey cannot be\
  \ counted in miles or kilometers. It is all about stories: of places, of things,\
  \ and, more importantly, of people. Today, I look differently at traveling. It is\
  \ the journey that goes on every day. I realized it does not matter whether I am\
  \ in Barcelona, Denver or Katowice. From every moment I can get inspiration. But\
  \ in order to have that I need to be open-minded and patient to hear what others\
  \ want to tell me."
