Text: "A heartbreak scripted my journey from Mumbai to Zagreb in 2016. I didn\u2019\
  t go chasing the man there. I was looking for something but I did not know what.\
  \ \nArmed with a compelling reason and a gullible heart, I ran into rough weather\
  \ the minute I landed at the Zagreb airport on a balmy September night. The Immigration\
  \ officer stared at my passport incredulously and said, \u2018I don\u2019t see the\
  \ Croatian Visa on any page here\u2019. I cleared my throat and pointed at the Schengen\
  \ Visa which had been issued to me. He said, \u2018Madam, this is not the right\
  \ one\u2019.  I realized I was on the verge of being sent back to India and my impending\
  \ fifteen day European trip was on the brink of going up in smoke. Holy smoke!\n\
  For the first time in my life, I was grateful for carrying that foreboding burden\
  \ of a recent heartbreak which allowed me to slip into the character of a crushed\
  \ girl. I looked at the Immigration officer beseechingly and pretended to be a writer\
  \ who had bypassed a more alluring option like Dubrovnik, to choose Zagreb because\
  \ of the Museum of Broken Relationships, where I intended to \u2018research\u2019\
  \ the love stories of people who had given away the souvenirs of relationships lost.\
  \ As the Immigration officer\u2019s heart went out to me, I grew stronger in my\
  \ narration and managed to convince him that through my writings, I would put Zagreb\
  \ on the map for the billion plus Indian population that had not woken up to the\
  \ charm of the city. He approved not just my entry, but my friend\u2019s entry with\
  \ much zeal. But a second misadventure awaited us. My friend\u2019s passport holder\
  \ was stolen on our way, in tram number 6, from the airport to the city centre.\
  \ The stolen passport holder not only had her passport, it carried both our shares\
  \ of Croatian Kuna. So, on a Saturday night we landed in the heart of the city without\
  \ any money because nobody was willing to accept our Euros. \nThe night turned us\
  \ into Alice in wonderland, where we followed zig-zag trails of trams trying to\
  \ pin down that particular tram where her bag had been picked. That night, we neither\
  \ found the passport nor had any money to buy us food. Making matter worse, the\
  \ next morning was a Sunday. All the Embassies were shut on a Sunday and most currency\
  \ converter shops too. So we held onto our Euros in despair. The silver lining though,\
  \ was that, the Museum of Broken Relationships was walking distance from our hotel\
  \ and we needed no money to reach it. It was a cathartic experience for me at the\
  \ museum as I looked at each displayed object. A rolling pin caught my eye- it was\
  \ sent by a daughter whose hand-written note spoke of her tumultuous relationship\
  \ with her mother which was symbolized by the rolling pin.  Then there was the Axe\
  \ by the Ex displayed, which earned maximum selfies.\nThe memorabilia that were\
  \ on sale, were bad memory erasers, breakup pencils and sweet nothings along with\
  \ a coffee shop that served us hot coffee and cakes baked with just the right amount\
  \ of sentimentality. \nI read through the brief synopses placed beneath each special\
  \ object embalmed in love lost. I also read the visitor\u2019s record book and although\
  \ the travelers had come from diverse cultures but everyone spoke the language of\
  \ love that transcended all barriers.  This shrine of broken relationships did something\
  \ miraculous to my friend, the cynic. I felt the walls of the museum, absorb my\
  \ hurt and hand my friend a gift. It helped her reconcile with her lost passport.\
  \ While we had been engrossed in the museum, someone had found her passport holder\
  \ which had her business card and that business card had her email id. Voila, through\
  \ that email, we were able to meet our well-wisher at the British Antique Market\
  \ next morning- just in time for us to make a local friend and catch a bus to our\
  \ next destination, Budapest. On that bus that day, traveled a healed heart and\
  \ a skeptic turned into a believer of hope and love."
