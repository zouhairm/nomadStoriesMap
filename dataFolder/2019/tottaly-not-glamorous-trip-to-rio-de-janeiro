Text: "In July 25th, 2013, around 3 a.m., I got my almost 15 kilos backpack and started\
  \ my way to Rio de Janeiro to attend the World Youth Day, a catholic event that\
  \ takes place every three years in a different city in the globe and celebrates\
  \ the importance of the young people to keep the religion alive. \n\nEven though\
  \ I was almost certain that I didn\u2019t believe in what the bible said, my 17\
  \ young self decided to go to make sure that religion was not for me, because if\
  \ seeing the Pope wouldn\u2019t spark anything inside of me, nothing would. \n\n\
  But I wasn\u2019t alone in this three-day trip. Besides me, most of my best friends\
  \ and other young boys and girls from the church that I used to go were in the bus\
  \ too. At total, there were around 30 people in the 7 hours drive from S\xE3o Paulo\
  \ to Rio de Janeiro.\n\nIn our way to one the most known city in the country there\
  \ was an electric feeling in the air. Something mixing excitement and the sensation\
  \ of not knowing what would happen in the next couple of days. And this feeling\
  \ kept growing every second that we get closer to our destination. A few stops and\
  \ hours later, we finally arrived at the neighborhood that volunteered to host us.\n\
  \nThis place is called Madureira. It is located at north of Rio and it\u2019s known\
  \ as the city suburb. But, different of the concept people have about suburbs in\
  \ the US, in Brazil this kind of place is where poor people go to find cheap housing.\
  \ Because of the low income of the families, the neighborhood is dirty, the houses\
  \ where clearly built by its own owners and we were warned to not stay out for too\
  \ long at night because the crime is big in the region. To have a proof of that,\
  \ in the first night there we heard gunshots in the distance. In the next day, our\
  \ host said that was probably a fight between two local gangs who sells drugs in\
  \ the area. \n\nAll the events in that weekend took place in Copacabana, about 25\
  \ kilometers from Madureira, where we were staying. To get there, we needed to take\
  \ the train. When it arrived, I feared stepping in the wrong place and falling in\
  \ the rails. The cars were extremely old, rusty, with pieces of the floor missing\
  \ and the junctions of the cars were open, and if we get too close you could easily\
  \ fall of the train.\n\nEvery day, we took a 45 minutes train ride to Rio de Janeiro\
  \ center and from there we walked ten kilometers to the beach were everything happened.\
  \ Even though we were always tired of walking we could see some of the most beautiful\
  \ landscapes in the world. Meeting people from around the world, Marina da Gloria,\
  \ P\xE3o de A\xE7\xFAcar, the blue sea and the thick sand were the highlights of\
  \ a draining and emotional trip. \n\nOn Sunday, the last day, we saw a lot of crying\
  \ before the mass, but not exclusively because of the emotion of the moment. Mine,\
  \ for example, was of tiredness and disappointment.\n\nAfter the outdoor mass ended,\
  \ we were so tired we could barely stand up. We been through so many feelings in\
  \ that weekend that we were emotionally and physically exhausted. But that wasn\u2019\
  t the end of our journey. To get home we had to walk more ten kilometers, to then\
  \ get a city bus that would take us to the travel bus that would be responsible\
  \ for driving back to S\xE3o Paulo. Sometimes I thought about giving up. The lack\
  \ of food was catching up to us, and I felt like I was going to pass out at any\
  \ point. But at least everyone was cheering the others up, and we, and our extremely\
  \ heavy backpacks, after walking for about three or four hours, finally got to our\
  \ bus. For the first time in days we could sleep properly and think about what happened\
  \ to us that weekend."
