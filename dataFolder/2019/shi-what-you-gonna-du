Text: "There we were. Three teenage womxn. In ShiDu. On a train platform. At night.\
  \ Without a plan. This is the story of my high school graduation camping trip from\
  \ Beijing to ShiDu.\n\nLike many recent graduates, after our high school graduation,\
  \ my friends and I wanted to go on a celebratory graduation trip. However, my friends\
  \ and I were not the most organised friendship group. Unlike our classmates, we\
  \ knew ourselves well enough to know that we would be unable to get ourselves together\
  \ in a way that would allow for long distance travel. Instead, we opted for a small\
  \ town, outside the city of Beijing where we all resided, known for its crystal\
  \ clear waters and karst landscape.\n\nThis was to be simple enough. So after seeing\
  \ our peers go off onto their vacations, my friends and I decided to finally committing\
  \ ourselves to going on our ill planned trip. We had no plan other than knowing\
  \ that we wanted to be near the (clean) water.\n\nThe 5 hour third-class ticket\
  \ train ride from Beijing to ShiDu was pleasant enough. Being a South African, Australian\
  \ and Chinese-American, experiences of being stared at for being a foreigner in\
  \ China was not new for my friends and I.\n\nThroughout the journey, there were\
  \ people bustling up and down the carriages. Hustling potential customers for transport\
  \ services and accommodation. Having dismissed them on the train, when we arrived\
  \ in ShiDu we found that these hustlers were the only modes of transport to be found\
  \ from the town's only station at that time of night.\n\nSemi-ashamed to be asking\
  \ a man we had previously turned down for a ride, we negotiated with the driver\
  \ to take us to the water. Driving along a dark road, the driver had tried dissuading\
  \ us from camping. Suggesting we stay at accomodation he was offering. No thanks.\
  \ He could not deter us. We were determined to camp (and too cheap to pay for accomodation).\n\
  \nA short drive from town, the driver veered off the road and announced that we\
  \ had arrived at the water. In the pitch black darkness we saw nothing. No lie-it\
  \ was scary. With a flashlight in hand, I walked down further into the darkness\
  \ with my friends clung onto either side of me as we giggled nervously. \n\nWe decided\
  \ on where to pitch our tent, pitched it then hung out. We were anxious and excited\
  \ to see what sunrise would reveal. What we saw was a sight I could not have anticipated.\
  \ Off the side of the road, we had found ourselves next to a stream moving towards\
  \ green rolling hills in the distant. Phew!\n\nFast-forward a few hours, after a\
  \ well deserved nap, my two friends and I decided to change location in search of\
  \ a more secluded place to shower. \n\nThis time, with the welcomed aid of sunlight,\
  \ we dropped off next to a lush green area with a stream running through.\n\nAfter\
  \ spending some time swimming and showering under a small waterfall, to our surprise\
  \ our belongings had been moved. Instead of being close to the stream, we had found\
  \ our towels hung on a clothesline to dry at a small cottage nearby. We had unknowingly\
  \ been swimming in a man's front yard!\n\nThe Chinese man, who we called Li Shu\
  \ Shu (Uncle Li), had decided to take us in. Through conversations with this kind\
  \ man, we found out that he was a former Buddhist monk who lived self-sufficiently\
  \ on his land. This involved cultivating tomatoes and honey. Li Shu Shu offered\
  \ us his front yard to pitch our tent-next to his bees. I wasn't shocked when he\
  \ told us he has three daughters of his own. He had that way about him.\n\nIn fears\
  \ of sounding old, I am not sure (over 10 years later) that I would encourage teenage\
  \ womxn to travel as recklessly as my teenage self and friends had. That said, I\
  \ live with no regret . We did what our peers did not. Before smartphones and instant\
  \ access to information, we went on a 3 day, 3 girls camping trip to the most beautiful\
  \ place I had seen while in China."
