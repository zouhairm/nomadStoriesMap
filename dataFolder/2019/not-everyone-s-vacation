Text: "Taghazout is a dusty surf town in the south of Morocco. Tourists like me come\
  \ and go for a week of surf and yoga, but the locals employed by the tourist industry\
  \ work seven days a week, year round. \n\nWhite and orange sun-stained buildings\
  \ scaffold the rocky road from the highway, to the coast. The edge of the town meets\
  \ the ocean, where cafes touch tide pools.  \n\nRooftops with laundry lines and\
  \ chill out areas face the bay and setting sun. As I watch the ocean swallow the\
  \ sun on the terrace of my hostel, Amin, a worker, asks me to join him for a walk.\
  \ \n\nExiting the hostel we pass his German shepherd, Viva, barking through her\
  \ gate. Her gate is often left open by hostel guests, causing her to get lost around\
  \ the town. \n\nWe empark down the dusty streets, stopping to admire stray cats\
  \ and dogs lounging or lurking on blue and white tiled porches. Amin is stopped\
  \ by a man outside a neighboring hostel, while they converse in Arabic, I take photos\
  \ of a cat. \n\nIt is dark, but the dusty road from our hostel intersects a luminous,\
  \ dusty parking lot the length of a football field. Tourist shops, a pharmacia,\
  \ a town square and bars border the lot. Their fluorescent lights are layered by\
  \ the dusty air from the cars, creating an orange haze against the dark sky. Welcome\
  \ to the Taghazout city center. \n\nHe asks if I want a drink, and by drink he means\
  \ a juice or smoothie. The juice shop smells citrusy, so I order an orange-lemon\
  \ and he an avocado smoothie. We chat about the Spanish drama on the television\
  \ in the juice bar, and how I don\u2019t like avocado smoothies. We are surrounded\
  \ by the sounds of the street, busy with people shuffling between the parking lot\
  \ and rooftop bars.  \n\nWalking across the main square to the beach, drinking our\
  \ juices, he tells me about his life. Amin is from Casablanca, but he came to work\
  \ in Taghazout seven months ago. His sister wants him to go to university, but he\
  \ feels obligated to send money to his family. He hasn\u2019t had a day off in months,\
  \ but as a driver, some days there isn\u2019t much work to do.  \n\nHis dog Viva\
  \ came to live with him four months ago. The man we encountered outside the hostel\
  \ told Amin he had put Viva in the trunk of his car when Amin was looking for her\
  \ today. \n\n\u201CWhy Man?\u201D Amin says. \u201CWhy does he treat me this way,\
  \ because I am not Berber.\u201D \n\nBerber\u2019s are an indigenous ethnic group\
  \ of Northern Africa. Because Amin is from the north of Morocco, and he does not\
  \ speak a Berber language, he tells me that many Taghazout locals treat him like\
  \ a tourist. \n\nThe incidence with Viva is common. People threaten his dog, or\
  \ they charge him for a service that should be free. That same week, a man had found\
  \ a ring that Amin lost, and asked him to pay 10 dirham if he wanted it back. \n\
  \nOn the pier, we listen to the waves under a sea of stars as people pass in groups\
  \ on their way to the colorful beach club 800 meters away. \n\nI can\u2019t remember\
  \ the last time I saw so many stars, despite the orange dusty haze that rises from\
  \ the cliffs from the street lamps. \n\nHe tells me he wishes he could go to Fez\
  \ with me tomorrow. We joke about getting in the hostel van, and not looking back.\
  \ But I know part of him isn\u2019t joking. \n\nWe continue stargazing, I point\
  \ out the little dipper, but I can\u2019t find Orion\u2019s belt that night. \n\n\
  He hopes to see me in Spain someday, but the Moroccan government doesn\u2019t issue\
  \ tourist visas to Moroccans easily. \n\nHow easily tourists like me can come and\
  \ go from Taghazout, but Moroccan people employed by the tourist industry work for\
  \ dirhams a day, unable to leave so freely. I hope he makes it to Spain someday."
