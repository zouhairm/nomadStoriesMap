Text: "A whole new world, just like an ost from Alladin movie. That is what I felt\
  \ when I put my first step in Maldives. \nIt's a whole new experience for me, come\
  \ to visiting an island-a beautiful one.\nA small but very authentic airports in\
  \ Mal\xE8 is very fascinating for me.\nTo continue my journey, a staff from hotel\
  \ pick me up in the airports. When usually they pick me up with a car, but in Mal\xE8\
  \ they pick me up with a speedboat. \nIt took me an half hour to reach my lodging,\
  \ ans I spend every minutes looking around those crystal clear water in Indian Ocean.\n\
  Arrived at a small island name Maafushi, they welcomed the tourist by giving us\
  \ a lei. Maafushi is a local island where the residents of Maldives lived. When\
  \ Maldives are known for the luxury resorts in a private island, Maafushi is different.\n\
  As one of the biggest island in Maldives, Maafushi is known as a popular local island\
  \ and they have their own regulations too.\nWearing bikinis for women and topless\
  \ for men are prohibited in this islands since the locals are muslims except in\
  \ the private area called bikini beach. \nWhen some people might think \"how could\
  \ we go holiday in beach area but prohibited to wear bikinis?\" Well don't worry!\
  \ You can go tanning and swimming in bikini beach. If that doesn't sounds interesting\
  \ enough for you, you can take the excursion trip around the island.\nOne the second\
  \ day of my visit, I went to sandbank. Tanning and having fun in the middle of Indian\
  \ Ocean while having my beer till sunsets. Another unforgettable moments in Maldives\
  \ is when I go to one day resorts trip. Some luxury resorts in Maldives allow us\
  \ experience the life of the luxury and enjoy their facility with the one day trip.\
  \ I chose to visit Anantara, a very beautiful resorts with an overwater villa around.\
  \ I spend a day there chillin myself in the pool, lunch at their high-class restaurants\
  \ and snorkeling in the beach. Overall, it was a million dollar worth the memory!"
