Text: "I left the hostel and rushed to Polanco, a luxurious district of CDMX, short\
  \ for Mexico City. The pick-up was to take place in front of a five-star hotel.\
  \ With a heavy piece and two backpacks, one being worn as a frontpack, I arrived\
  \ there in advance. As a semi-professional traveler, I had to blend in with the\
  \ full-price guests who were to hop on from this posh area. Was Rancho Las Cascadas\
  \ one of those artificial resorts? If so, adaptation could be difficult for a Turkish\
  \ journalist freshly out of prison.\n\nThe van arrived and the tall, brown driver\
  \ got off to help me with the luggage. \u201CMy name is Max\u201D he said gently\
  \ in Spanglish and we set off. Two others joined along the way: Elka, an elderly\
  \ German lady working at her country\u2019s embassy, and June, a mid-aged American\
  \ businesswoman. We passed through Avenida Reforma, on which I had recently interviewed\
  \ \"Nos Faltan 43\" protesters. Families and comrades were holding the government\
  \ responsible for the disappearance of young teachers, giving Mexico the image of\
  \ a troubled-yet-democratic country, a title still ahead of my homeland\u2019s.\n\
  \nThe ranch was an hour\u2019s drive to the North. After dealing with the gridlocked\
  \ downtown traffic, we passed through industrial zones with dense, metallic air,\
  \ and then, colorful villages of slightly scarred pastoral beauty. As the van approached\
  \ the gate, a group of visitors were leaving the ranch on horseback in the guidance\
  \ of local, young wranglers wearing shiny white cowboy hats. Jenny, the Canadian\
  \ director of the premises, welcomed us.\n\nMy worries were in vain: Nothing was\
  \ pretentious at all. The staff lived in nearby villages and were friendly both\
  \ with the management and guests. Jenny had found her dream job and lifestyle in\
  \ this opposite neighbour of the USA: The ranch gently employed more than 40 horses,\
  \ some of which were rescued and rehabilitated. Jenny\u2019s home was nearby and\
  \ she was keeping the retired animals there while raising two children with her\
  \ husband.\n\n\u201CI only have some very basic experience\u201D must have read\
  \ differently than the way I meant it: On the first group ride, our 19-year-old\
  \ wrangler Antonio screamed \u201CCanter!\u201D after passing the river. And my\
  \ appointed horse Calypso began to race, forcing me to stick to the saddle. Unlike\
  \ Antonio, I had no trophies from rodeos on bulls\u2019 backs. All my bones ached\
  \ on the first night.\n\nDecember was the best month to visit Mexico for it was\
  \ the coolest and the least rainy. Just ideal for a guy who escaped the harsh winter\
  \ of his hometown half a world away! As nights go cold only for a few weeks, Mexican\
  \ accommodations normally lack built-in heating. To fire up the kerosene kept in\
  \ a metal case among stones was an unusual-yet-effective solution to the chills.\n\
  \nI became friends with people from various countries. Frequent guests who were\
  \ avid riders told me similar experiences costed much more anywhere else, and without\
  \ the benefits of such amazing cuisine.\n\nCascadas meant waterfalls. I learned\
  \ to count on Calypso\u2019s hoofs while climbing steep rocks. Horses were part\
  \ of nature and nature had its way of embracing you once you let go of dark memories.\n\
  \nDuring the group rides, we took ten in a smaller village. Tying your horse to\
  \ a pole in front of the only market to buy snacks and soda had this amazing post-western\
  \ feel to it. What I disliked was the village arena, where bullfights were held\
  \ in summer. Though Mexico was not even half as sketchy as many thought, such traditional\
  \ mistreatment was still a thing.\n\nIt was on my last day that I discovered Max\
  \ was Jenny\u2019s husband: \u201CShe had come here as a guest on her first journey\
  \ after college, and we fell in love. I was a wrangler back then. Jenny lost her\
  \ brother the same year our first kid was born. Her parents were both devastated\
  \ and happy when they visited Mexico to see their granddaughter.\u201D\n\nLas Cascadas\
  \ was the highlight of my travels in Mexico. I was to return home to face new charges\
  \ over publications, and I had stocked up loads of freedom on horseback against\
  \ the probability of even longer jail time."
