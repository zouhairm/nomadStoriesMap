Text: "\u201CDo you speak Fulani?\u201D, Drew asked? \n\nA circle of boys and young\
  \ men surrounded us, curiously. They didn\u2019t seem afraid, but their stares were\
  \ blank and they stood stone still, with their hands on their hips. They waited\
  \ for the foreign oddities on bicycles, deep in the sands of the Sahel desert in\
  \ northern Burkina Faso to make a move. \n\n\u201CFofo\u201D, I said. It means \u201C\
  hello\u201D. It was the extent of my Fulani. The little boys looked at each other\
  \ and giggled shyly but didn\u2019t respond. An older man walked up slowly. He carried\
  \ a long stick, the end softened by many hours of walking with it, switching cattle\
  \ and camels \u2013 the multi-tool of the desert. A little boy wearing jelly shoes\
  \ walked slowly over to the bike and fingered a tube of sunscreen. It popped out\
  \ from under a taunt bungee and fell into the sand. He picked it up. \n\nThe older\
  \ man tisked, pursing and pointing his lips at us. Without words he said to the\
  \ boy, \u201Cgive it back to them\u201D. The boy handed it gently to me. I bowed\
  \ with my hands together, saying \u201Cthank you\u201D.\n\n\u201CHello monsieur.\
  \ We are looking for a place to sleep\u201D, Drew pantomimed sleeping on a pillow\
  \ with his hands held under his head. They stood silently.\n\n\u201CDrew, I\u2019\
  m not sure they use pillows\u201D, I said. \n\nDrew tried again. \u201CSleep?\u201D\
  \ He closed his eyes and made a snoring noise. \u201CCan we sleep here?\u201D. Essentially,\
  \ can we share your piece of desert for the night?\n\n\u201CFuka?\u201D the man\
  \ said.\n\n\u201CYes, maybe! Maybe we fuka. We need to fuka!\u201D. The sentence\
  \ seemed absurd and yet we seemed to be communicating finally. Drew\u2019s excitement\
  \ energized the crowd. \u201CFuka! Oui, fuka!\u201D. There was commotion and talk,\
  \ although likely no further words were understood by either party. The children\
  \ started smiling, sensing now that their fathers were not intimidated. A couple\
  \ ran away and came back with a clay pot with water that was a thick shade of brown.\
  \ Water is a customary offering of welcome in Burkina Faso and in addition to being\
  \ exactly what our parched throats needed, it signified that we were welcome. It\
  \ was wet and we were grateful. \n\nWe slowly set up tents not far from their own\
  \ cloth tents, offering our own gifts of peanuts and small candies to the group\
  \ that had grown to a large audience. The men squatted and examined the sheer fabric\
  \ and the tent poles that popped together, held with elastic chord. They talked\
  \ amongst themselves, possibly debating the merit, or more likely the senselessness\
  \ of this style of construction in the desert. They pulled their robes around their\
  \ bodies, staying cool by keeping the harsh sun off of their skin, while we wore\
  \ light colored tech fabrics with venting, pants with zip off legs and rubbed cream\
  \ into our skin in the bright sun.   \n\nThe small boy with jelly shoes came over\
  \ with an enameled pan of rice. He pointed at the tube of sunscreen once again and\
  \ in the glow of the setting sun that seemed to stretch the entire width of the\
  \ horizon, I put a dab on his nose and forehead. He rubbed it in vigorously with\
  \ his palms. He and others stood in a circle around the tent for most of the night,\
  \ watching us and talking softly.\n\nWe had left the asphalt in Dori, Burkina Faso,\
  \ expecting the roads on the map to lead us through the Sahel to Niamey, Niger.\
  \ \n\nInstead the donkey paths in the grass had withered away in the dry season.\
  \ The border guard was napping when we crossed. When thorns ate through every bicycle\
  \ tube we hailed a trash truck on its way to Niamey. Drew rode in back, on top of\
  \ the piles of garbage where they had stored our bikes. I rode in the cab with the\
  \ driver. \n\n\u201CYou did what?\u201D, the driver asked. \u201CYou rode your bicycle\
  \ from Dori to here? How did you know where to go?\u201D.\n\n\u201CEach time we\
  \ met the Fulani, we asked \u2018where is Niger\u2019 and they pointed. We followed\
  \ their fingers\u201D.\n\nThe driver shook his head. \u201CLes blanches sont fous\u201D\
  . White people are crazy."
