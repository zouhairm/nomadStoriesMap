Text: "In June 2017 I left Italy to join an international internship programme and\
  \ I spent six months working in Argentina.\n\nI choose that destination because\
  \ I wanted to distance myself from everything I knew and also because I have always\
  \ been deeply attracted to South America. \n\nOnce I started my job, I did my best\
  \ to fit trips to my working schedule. I was lucky enough to have a colleague of\
  \ mine on board most of the times, and so we took some days off travelling all around\
  \ Argentina with our backpacks. \n\nI don\u2019t know if it was because I had finally\
  \ realised I actually was in South America or because of the rough time I was having\
  \ at that moment, but one day, during my coffee break at work, I decided to make\
  \ one of my dreams come true. I took advantage of the fact that I was in Latin America,\
  \ and I booked a flight to Rio de Janeiro.\n\nThis time there was not going to any\
  \ colleague of mine to share the adventure with. I would have been on my own, with\
  \ my backpack and my diary. A couple of weeks after, I was waiting at the gate to\
  \ get on my flight to Rio and had no idea of what I was going to find once my experience\
  \ there started. I felt deep excitement, some sort of electrical happiness. What\
  \ I had always thought to be just an unreachable idea was coming true in front of\
  \ my eyes and, moreover, I was doing that completely on my own, without any proper\
  \ preparation that could have somehow slowly made me realise what was going to happen.\n\
  \nWhen I saw the countless lights of favelas from the plane, spreading all over\
  \ the famous hills of Rio, I believed that all was real. \n\nUp until that point,\
  \ I could remember all events as they happened, following a very clear order. But\
  \ then I got so absorbed by life in Rio that any logical sequence of facts seems\
  \ impossible to remember, and to this date I still base my memories more on feelings,\
  \ smells, tastes and colours than on time.\n\nI was completely overwhelmed by the\
  \ Carioca lifestyle. My new crazy routine started when I met a Brazilian girl for\
  \ the first time. She brought me to a club in Copacabana, quite close to the hostel\
  \ where we met, and I can easily say that I have never danced so intensely and long\
  \ as I did that night. My body was moving without my permission and I was enjoying\
  \ that absence of control very much. After that moment, a non-stop sequence of events\
  \ started and every crazy day finished in the early hours with me staring at the\
  \ sun rising from the ocean, with the unique flavour of Caipirinha in my mouth.\
  \ \n\nIf I think about those days in Rio de Janeiro, an idea of freedom immediately\
  \ comes to my mind, which also brings the image of me walking barefoot on the cool\
  \ sand of Copacabana beach, as I go for my morning running session. Even if my memories\
  \ of Rio concern mostly the ocean and beautiful beaches, I believe that the real\
  \ soul of the cidade maravilhosa lies in Lapa and in the old city area, where lots\
  \ of people come down along the streets, dancing together, playing music, jumping\
  \ from a botequim to the other, celebrating the present by putting second as much\
  \ energy as they have into each . \n\nThe last day I was in Rio I decided to \u2018\
  turn the volume down\u2019 and I went for a walk along Ipanema, which offers another\
  \ point of view on Rio de Janeiro, showing a composed and quieter city, with green\
  \ boulevards and relaxing small squares. It was the perfect place to visit before\
  \ leaving such a vibrant city.\n\nAt the end of each day, I could find myself thinking\
  \ about all the people I shared all those intense moments with, reflecting about\
  \ the energetic power of this city that mixes poverty with music and smiles, a city\
  \ where Nature wins over Urbanism, and I felt as alive as ever."
