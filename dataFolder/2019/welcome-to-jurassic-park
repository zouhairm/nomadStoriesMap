Text: "While on a New Year trip to Rotterdam, the Netherlands, I spent a particularly\
  \ soggy and drab day at the nearby Blijdorp Zoo. On entering the gates to the attraction,\
  \ I knew at once that this place was something special. Not only was the site gigantic,\
  \ housing both a fully-fledged zoo and an aquarium of the same size, but the space,\
  \ care and attention given to the animals was also deeply encouraging.\n\nThe Zoo\
  \ presents itself as a tour of the world and its many different inhabitants, with\
  \ separate sets of enclosures for animals native to each continent. Something particularly\
  \ unique about each of these enclosures was the way they bring you up close to the\
  \ action. A platform suspended above the curious bobbing heads of giraffes. A tunnel\
  \ through a desert of mischievous meerkats and lazy tortoises. A pathway beneath\
  \ towering trees on which dozed a family of red pandas.\n\nAmong all of the weird\
  \ and wonderful sights, some were particularly memorable. On Raccoon Island, I witnessed\
  \ a squad of the masked bandits marching in perfect single file around the back\
  \ of a hill. And in the North America zone, I was able to pet a prairie dog in its\
  \ open enclosure, who made a very high-pitched protest when the petting stopped\
  \ in my effort to take its photo.\n\nYet it was the Amazon Rainforest enclosure\
  \ which turned this visit from a simple daytrip into a purely magical experience.\
  \ The entrance to the giant tent was a sort of airlock of two doors. As I pushed\
  \ through the first door, I was hit at once by a sudden and unexpected wave of heat.\
  \ After the bitter winter chill outside, the warmth was a very welcome adjustment.\
  \ Then I stepped through the next door, and into an entirely different world. \n\
  \nLush, deep green plants as far as the eye could see, the sort I\u2019d never seen\
  \ before. Some tall, others wide-stretching, some magnificent and others still completely\
  \ hideous. Huge, alien flowers and long, sinuous vines swinging from one tree to\
  \ the next. As I took in the wild scene before me, there was a moment of shock as\
  \ a huge, vibrantly coloured butterfly the size of my hand fluttered leisurely before\
  \ me. Followed by another, and another. And soon I realised that I was surrounded\
  \ by countless gigantic, vivid butterflies. The space all around me was suddenly\
  \ alive with a psychedelic rainbow of beating wings upon a backdrop of tropical\
  \ green. They danced seamlessly in the air, only landing occasionally to feed on\
  \ peculiar flowers or sweet slices of orange laying on the branches of trees.\n\n\
  Walking on, drinking in as much of the breath-taking scene as I possibly could,\
  \ a wooden bridge came into sight, stretching over a small, deep-blue river. All\
  \ it took was a single glance over the side to find myself once again completely\
  \ astounded by the sight before me. Monstrous black fish the size of alligators,\
  \ gliding determinedly through the rich blue stream. A koi pond on steroids. A little\
  \ voice in the back of my head called out, Welcome\u2026 to Jurassic Park.\n\nThere\
  \ was something deeply enchanting about this environment. Something about the surrealness\
  \ of it all, the bizarre vegetation, the heavy and humid air and the oversized creatures\
  \ above and below made me feel more at peace than ever before. I had always known\
  \ that this place and its inhabitants existed elsewhere in the world, but seeing\
  \ them right there for myself made it real. For one long, incredible moment I was\
  \ made to feel like I was actually in the rainforest. Suddenly, my mind flooded\
  \ with thoughts and images of the many extraordinary places and animal species all\
  \ over the world, of which I really only know very few.\n\nAlthough I had always\
  \ had a great appreciation for our earthly neighbours, I left Blijdorp Zoo with\
  \ a much greater sense of respect and wonder for nature. There was a new feeling\
  \ of longing deep within me; a yearning to see and discover all of the weird and\
  \ wonderful creatures of the world, in their natural habitats."
