Text: "Once upon a time during magical Christmas holidays in Copenhagen, I got lucky\
  \ enough to meet a young British in a hostel. While strolling around the city on\
  \ the first evening (yes, backpacking makes you friends with people quicker than\
  \ you think), I told her about my little travel tradition \u2013 I always send postcards\
  \ to myself from everywhere I go. It\u2019s like a time capsule: you come back home\
  \ feeling blue you\u2019re back to your routine and at one point you open a mailbox\
  \ to find a picture of the place you fell in love with. And on the other side \u2013\
  \ a message to yourself from yourself saying that you should never forget how much\
  \ fun you\u2019ve had there and how beautiful life actually is. My travel buddy\
  \ got so enchanted by this bizarre feature of me she even decided to try it herself.\
  \ And guess what? She loved it and even wrote about it in her blog. Fun fact: we\
  \ were on the same plane from London and ended up in the same room in the hostel!\
  \ What are the odds. I clearly remember her saying how she always wanted to travel,\
  \ explore the States and Australia (oh, she is such a huge fan of Australia) but\
  \ never really had a chance to do it. Denmark was the first big step for her. After\
  \ three days of our \u2018friendship\u2019, we followed each other on social media\
  \ and that was pretty much it.\n\nCan you believe if I\u2019m going to say that\
  \ in the following year I got to watch her spending a couple of months in the USA\
  \ and then conquering Australia and even parts of Asia? On Instagram, Facebook and\
  \ her blog. While I inspired her to send a postcard to remember the journey she\u2019\
  s been through, she inspired me, as cheesy as it sounds, to never give up on the\
  \ dreams and write about all the happy times of travels. Maybe we were destined\
  \ to meet?\n\nThis is the exact reason I love traveling. You never know who and\
  \ when you are going to meet. Maybe a smiling stranger in the underground of Vienna\
  \ will turn your world upside down. Or maybe you will meet a person with a best\
  \ friend living on a street next to yours back in Finland. This is a true story,\
  \ guys, it actually happened! I didn\u2019t expect to find an Italian guy in Vienna\
  \ who actually knows where Mikkeli is (the city where I used to study). His best\
  \ friend is actually living right there! What a small place the world is. Now we\u2019\
  re friends on Facebook and he always invites me to visit him on Sardinia when he\
  \ has a chance.\n\nBut probably one of the most amazing connections I\u2019ve built\
  \ throughout my travels is with a Mexican guy I met in Prague. Yup, not a Czech.\
  \ This amazing person has been traveling for the past decade and he hasn\u2019t\
  \ had a proper job since that. All of his travels were sponsored by him creating\
  \ and selling macram\xE9 accessories. He obviously didn\u2019t sell them very legally\
  \ but does it even matter when you get a chance to see the world? But the thing\
  \ that amazed me the most is the book which he is carrying with him everywhere he\u2019\
  s ever been to. Whenever he meets a person who, he thinks, has some impact on him,\
  \ he asks him or her to write down 5 things they want to do before they die. And\
  \ holy guacamole, this book is a treasure. So many fingerprints of people in all\
  \ the languages of the world dating back to 2010. I almost cried when after less\
  \ than 24 hours of knowing each other he asked to leave a piece of me in it as well.\n\
  \nI might have never been bitten by crocodiles in Africa (yet) or jumped from the\
  \ Eiffel tower but my memory carries so many amazing people. This is the most fascinating\
  \ part of every journey \u2013 how you believe in people more and more every time\
  \ you discover a new culture. You just meet crazy strangers and they make you feel\
  \ the real taste of life. And that\u2019s that."
