Text: "My 95-year-old grandmother Betty speaks fondly of her childhood, spent on a\
  \ farm near Nhill, regional Victoria. A one pub farming town, famous for a talking\
  \ horse statue.\n\nHaving planned a road-trip from Sydney to Melbourne to visit\
  \ friends, I thought Nhill might make an interesting spot to break the return journey\
  \ as it was only four hours from Melbourne.\n\nI expected to spend a night in a\
  \ cheap motel, take photos of the main street and pick up a souvenir, but when I\
  \ mentioned to my grandmother I might visit Nhill, she piped up and said, \u201C\
  there might be relatives still alive there.\u201D\n\nWe made several phone calls\
  \ and two distant cousins were alive in Nhill; Ewan and Maureen. They were both\
  \ Cameron\u2019s from my grandmother\u2019s lineage. \n\nMy great-great-grandfather\
  \ Allan Paul Cameron shipped out to Australia from the Isle of Skye, seeking a better\
  \ life and ended up in Nhill where he married a young barmaid, Mary Redden.\n\n\
  My middle name is Cameron, though I knew little of its origins, but the moment I\
  \ walked into Ewan\u2019s house he at once said \u201Cyep, he\u2019s a Cameron.\u201D\
  \ \n\nA casual comment that brought me to tears. I\u2019d never met my father; he\
  \ doesn\u2019t even know I exist, and so grappled with what influence his genes\
  \ may have had on my identity. Yet here was a stranger who recognised me as his\
  \ family.\n\nEwan had hours of stories to share and hundreds of photos. Learning\
  \ that my great-great-grandfather Allan was a geographer, an avid writer and who\
  \ didn\u2019t drink, captivated me.\n\nI wanted to know more because I topped my\
  \ school in geography three years running, love to write and don\u2019t drink alcohol.\
  \ \n\nEwan took me to the farm, the house was standing but with timber planks strewed\
  \ across the grass. Amongst the rubble was a tiny green leather shoe (which belonged\
  \ to my great-aunt Catherine), a broken piece of porcelain\u2014once a roasting\
  \ dish, and empty medicine bottles. Junk to most people, but this was my family\
  \ history.\n\nOn the far edge of what was the family farm, stood a weeping yellow\
  \ gum tree with drooping leaves like dangling fingers. It\u2019s a crossbreed, and\
  \ the only known specimen in Australia. Stories abound on how it came into existence\
  \ but no one knows.\n\nEwan loved telling stories and his own kids had grown weary\
  \ of them years ago. The most poignant one involved his partner, Misako who Ewan\
  \ had met teaching English in Japan (which I also did). \n\nWhilst on holiday in\
  \ Niagara Falls, Canada, Misako bought a ceramic teacup as a souvenir and wrapped\
  \ it in newspaper for protection. Once back in Japan she jokingly tossed Ewan the\
  \ newspaper saying \u201Cyou might like to read this, it\u2019s in English.\u201D\
  \ \n\nOn the front cover was a story of a young violinist named Allan Paul Cameron,\
  \ the nephew of Allan Paul Cameron who had left Scotland for Australia.\n\nIt\u2019\
  s confusing everyone having the same name but my great-great-grandfather\u2019s\
  \ brother, left for America, then they lost contact. The article showed a clan of\
  \ Cameron\u2019s living in Nova Scotia, Canada\u2014distant relatives unknown.\n\
  \nLater that afternoon, I headed to town to take photos of the Nhill shops and I\
  \ stopped in at Amber\u2019s Sweet Bliss, for a coffee and to contemplate all I\u2019\
  d learnt. It was a homely cafe rolling out fresh-baked goods all day.\n\nI couldn\u2019\
  t resist a slice of orange and ginger cheesecake. It reminded me of a delicate kiss\
  \ as it dissolved on my tongue, its soft citrus juxtaposed by the crumbly biscuit\
  \ base, spiced with ginger.\n\nThat night I had dinner in the only pub in town,\
  \ at the table next to me a group of friendly locals insisted I eat with them. Curious\
  \ about my adventures in Nhill, they laughed when I mentioned I was a Cameron. One\
  \ of them had been engaged to my cousin Ewan\u2019s brother Richard.\n\nI expected\
  \ little from a small country town, but I found part of my identity, incredible\
  \ cheesecake, and a unique tree in Australia\u2019s history proving there\u2019\
  s something unique to find in every town, regardless of its size."
