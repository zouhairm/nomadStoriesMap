Text: "A strange stillness lingered in the streets heading to the Beyoglu district,\
  \ a usually vibrant hub of Istanbul's European side. An even further cry from the\
  \ hustle and bustle of the streets and markets on the Asian side of the Bosphorus,\
  \ interlaced with trays of tea nimbly swung through crowds as men sipped and smoked\
  \ away unaware, or just numb, to the acrobatic journeys involved in their drink\
  \ deliveries. A distant pop and hiss echoed from one of the many narrow streets\
  \ that littered either side of Istiklal Caddesi. As we continued the journey back\
  \ to the apartment, a familiar turn returned an unfamiliar sensory experience. A\
  \ stinging tingle on exposed skin and a harsh and bitter taste entered mouth, a\
  \ stark contrast to the sweet, oily flavours of lunch, a mackerel sandwich generously\
  \ dressed with pomegranate molasses, sumac and salad, purchased from a tea-sipping,\
  \ chain-smoking riverside food seller. \n\nAnother pop and hiss, closer now, shortly\
  \ followed by a thunder of feet. Crowds of people raced round the corner and into\
  \ the main street, a shout of \u2018Gaz! Gaz!\u2019 accompanying. An entrepreneurial\
  \ tea seller, enlightened by this shout, pulls a wad of cheap masks from under his\
  \ tea trolley. The shouts alert those nearby to the tear gas just fired into the\
  \ streets by Turkish police, a chemical illegal in international warfare due to\
  \ its effects on humans, but oddly fine to use on civilians by police forces. The\
  \ latest set of protests had erupted against both Tayyip Erdogan\u2019s government\
  \ and plans to transform one of Istanbul\u2019s major green spaces into a shopping\
  \ centre. A branched ignition of the Arab Spring that had erupted over the recent\
  \ months. \n\nThe only choice was to turn back, to avoid the venomous concoction\
  \ of air and tear gas that burned and purged liquid from nose, eyes and mouth. On\
  \ returning to the main street, a troop of armed police, head to toe in blue, and\
  \ armed as if in a war zone rather than the metropolitan hub of a city. For hours\
  \ a game of cat and mouse ensued as swathes of protesters fled police and clouds\
  \ of gas whilst a personal game of \u2018find a way home\u2019 ensued betwixt events.\
  \ Militarised vehicles patrol the side streets, pumping gas canisters into groups\
  \ like armoured skunks as armed and shielded patrols block both exit and entrance.\
  \ \n\nAt one point, as if priorly agreed, both sides come to a pause. The busy tea\
  \ seller, running one moment and lingering the next, returns to selling his goods\
  \ of choice, flutes of tea. Protesters and police sit along the ground, masks and\
  \ helmets set aside, some even sat in groups among each other, to partake in their\
  \ current common ground: an enjoyment for tea. An odd truce between factions at\
  \ war only minutes prior. \n\nAs the opposing sides enjoy their moments of respite,\
  \ the previously blocked thoroughfare that leads to our destination appears to have\
  \ opened up. As we traverse the final stretch, a simple journey elongated by protest,\
  \ the pop that had become so familiar over the trip echoed in the background, signalling\
  \ a resuming of opposition between the groups. As the key turns in the apartment\
  \ block door, a canister fired down the street whizzes behind. The hiss and shouts\
  \ of \u2018Gaz! Gaz!\u2019 echo as the door shuts, relived. \n\nFinally home, we\
  \ entered into the apartment, slightly tainted by tear gas canisters from the streets\
  \ below that had seeped in through the open window, left to alleviate the stifling\
  \ heat that often welcomes visitors to unventilated Turkish rooms. The answer to\
  \ this quandary, substantially British, yet seemingly Turkish as well? Tea."
