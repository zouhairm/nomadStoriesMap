Text: "I'm enjoying my presence in this city. It's sunny, the skies are clear. Posted\
  \ on the streets are gorgeous army men carrying deadly weapons. I wouldn't say I'm\
  \ having fun. This isn't fun. Conversation is dead. My sister wants mostly to sleep,\
  \ to shop and is enticed by anything Disney. I want to talk but struggle to light\
  \ the conversation. So I drink and hope my intoxication will give me courage to\
  \ approach her with a notion, a quip.\n\nI fail, dramatically, and I begin to shrink.\
  \ I feel so little around her. We drank on another bar boat anchored to the Seine.\
  \ Painted in cobalt blue, we rock ever so slightly in the water. I wanted to cry\
  \ at my state of isolation. If I wanted isolation I\u2019d be in Melbourne, writing.\
  \ A holiday is to share your company with another, share memories. Every request\
  \ for silence feels like a dismissal of my being. It\u2019s shattering me. Maybe\
  \ this loft is too small for the both of us. Le Marais is bristling with vitality.\
  \ There are as many people laughing as there are dishes on restaurant tables up\
  \ and down 00 Street. Waiters smartly dressed in black and white tend to the famished\
  \ tourist looking to fill the next three hours gathered around a table, dining on\
  \ the local cuisine. \n\nThe next city will be better. Maybe. I drink. At the bottom\
  \ of the longnecks there\u2019s a promise of bravery, so I drink. I am largely to\
  \ blame. You see, I make stringent efforts to socialize with others. It\u2019s painful,\
  \ and I end up talking so quietly. And I feel embarrassed sitting around those iconic\
  \ round Parisian tables, both of us staring out into the distance. I have to prompt\
  \ her to talk to me. I am currently listening to Childish Gambino\u2019s Awaken,\
  \ My Love! There is one track on repeat. \u2018Terrified.\u2019 At the three-minute\
  \ mark, I start the song, skipping over Childish Gambino\u2019s lyrics and wrapping\
  \ myself in the haunting cry of the child singing \u2018Oh, you can\u2019t run from\
  \ me. You can\u2019t hide from me.\u201D I\u2019m hit with a wave of blue shadowed\
  \ by black. A sensation to match my current emotions. \n\nWe recently returned home,\
  \ (another thing, she doesn\u2019t like my refereeing to this Air BnB as our home)\
  \ from a hunt for Ben and Jerry\u2019s ice cream sandwich. She saw it advertised\
  \ on a shop window the other day, somewhere in the backstreets of Le Marais. To\
  \ her credit, she extender the invitation to this hunt. Her second try. She made\
  \ an attempt earlier, returned to the loft, and wanted another go at it. The invitation\
  \ was leaking with pity. So desperate I am for company, I put on my sneakers. I\
  \ am locked on this idea that we are on holiday together, so we should enjoy at\
  \ least a few days together, I am crippled by the weight of my own anxiety that\
  \ I can\u2019t unlatch myself from the safety of my homebase long enough to wander\
  \ around, hit up bars and socialize. I need air. And night doesn\u2019t arrive until\
  \ long after ten. Our hunt lasted perhaps twenty minutes, walking the backstreets\
  \ \u2013 from Rue des Gravilliers down to Rue du Temple, to Rue Michel le Comte.\
  \ \n\nThe weather was glorious. It has been since we landed. This trip is a bore.\
  \ I want to drink, but mostly to laugh. It feels as though I\u2019m on this trip\
  \ alone, an idea I can\u2019t divorce myself from. I feel I will return to Melbourne\
  \ in low spirits. Perhaps it\u2019s the liquor that is making me want to cry (it\u2019\
  s mostly all left me, but I feel restricted all the same). And largely it\u2019\
  s due to my inability to socialize painlessly with strangers, and sober. I think\
  \ I\u2019ve given up. I will wait patiently until we reach Florence, where a cousin\
  \ of ours will meet us. It\u2019s as though I am watching a child. A stuck-up, indulgent\
  \ child who has a sickness worse than mine. Who I can\u2019t criticize in fear that\
  \ she will act brashly and run off with a stranger and stay in his house in a suburb\
  \ I can\u2019t pronounce somewhere in France."
