Text: "\u201CDo you sell bike locks here?\u201D I panted at the grocery store clerk.\
  \ \n\n\u201CUmm, yes, we do. They\u2019re over in that section\u201D answered Otto,\
  \ the customer service manager at the Kvickly. \n\n\u201CGreat, thank you!\u201D\
  \ \n\nStrange to ask if a grocery store sells bike locks. But stranger, that the\
  \ store did indeed have bike locks. Multiple! This was Denmark after all.\n\nThe\
  \ bus we needed to catch arrived in 7 minutes, and I was at least a three-minute\
  \ bike ride away from the bus stop. I needed to move kvick-I mean, quickly. I returned\
  \ to the counter thirty seconds later, the cheapest bike lock I could find in hand.\
  \ \n\n\u201CFind it?\u201D asked Otto politely.\n\n\u201CYes\u201D, I replied. \u201C\
  And one more weird question, do you mind cutting the package off of this lock?\u201D\
  \n\n\u201CNo problem\u201D the manager exhaled. While he struggled to free the lock\
  \ from the plastic restraints, I noticed, comfortingly, that he had a tinge of red\
  \ in his cheeks and a bead of sweat threatened to topple off his forehead. The Danes\
  \ weren\u2019t used to heat and humidity this late in August. \n\n\u201CGreat thank\
  \ you for your help, have a great day!\u201D I shouted over my shoulder. \n\nI jumped\
  \ onto my bicycle and tried to peddle, but immediately met resistance. Nearly tumbling\
  \ over the handlebars, I had forgotten to unlock the back wheel. The equivalent\
  \ of trying to run with your shoelaces tied together. \n\nI found J\xFAlia waiting\
  \ at the bus stop, ninety seconds to spare. Holding the bike lock over my head like\
  \ a prize fighter who just won the world championship belt, I jumped off the bike.\
  \ The lock barely fit, but we pushed the bikes\u2019 front tires together, locking\
  \ them to each other, and finally to the bike rack. \n\nWe stepped onto the bus.\
  \ \n\nThe trip started 30 minutes earlier, at Steng\xE5rdens, a small farm just\
  \ outside of Copenhagen. J\xFAlia had heard of a summer music festival taking place\
  \ at Svanholm, another farm about 50 kilometers away. Since we both had the next\
  \ two days off, we resolved to try our luck with the robust Danish public transportation\
  \ system. Google told us to take a slapdash of trains and buses- a route that otherwise\
  \ could only be found in a game of Shoots-and-Ladders.  \n\nFour hours, three buses\
  \ and one train later, J\xFAlia leaned over.\n\u201C\xBFTe parece que hemos llegado?\u201D\
  \n\n\u201CI think so\u201D, I posited. \n\nWe leapt off the 310 R bus, into the\
  \ damp, dank, Danish countryside. Through the increasingly intense rain, J\xFAlia\
  \ and I squinted first at each other, then our gazes shifted, straining to see the\
  \ end of the dirt road.\n\n\u201CVenga, let\u2019s go!\u201D she resolved.\n\nMoving\
  \ quickly down the path, J\xFAlia and I dodged waxing puddles and avalanches of\
  \ rain that suddenly fell from the oak tree branches above. Both volunteers at an\
  \ organic farm or \u201Cwwoofers\u201D, we were far from our respective homelands;\
  \ Spain and the USA. In the six weeks, that we overlapped at Steng\xE5rdens, we\
  \ grew close, finding any excuse to weed rows of entangled strawberry plants next\
  \ to each other. Having just spent a year in Spain, my Spanish was decent, but her\
  \ English was even better. Our conversations weaved through the day\u2019s work\
  \ like a breeze through the corn fields. Back-and-forths comprised of equal parts\
  \ insults and jokes, her jousts in Spanish and my parries in English. \n\nAfter\
  \ ten minutes of puddle hopping down the path surrounded by dense forest, we finally\
  \ encountered a clearing and a sign. The sign was a black swan, face-to-face with\
  \ a white swan, the negative heart shaped space between swans colored in striking,\
  \ blood red. Below the swans large, black letters spelled out \u201CSVANHOLM\u201D\
  .\n\n\u201CJoder, we made it- finalmente\u201D exclaimed J\xFAlia. \n\nWe came to\
  \ Svanholm to find a night of music. Along the way, or maybe long, long before that,\
  \ we found each other."
