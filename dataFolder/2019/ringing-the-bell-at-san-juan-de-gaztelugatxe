Text: "As I was climbing the steps, I felt a constant tingle on my feet and fingers.\
  \ I held on to the each side with my hands, at times, when the space was too wide\
  \ I would hold on to the side with both. I also had to find moments to stop to let\
  \ other visitors go by and children on a fieldtrip excitedly run past. The kids\
  \ were running up and down the stairs as if it was nothing, they were not concerned\
  \ about the danger of falling. I was terrified, and yet, when I stopped, I took\
  \ out my selfie-stick and attempted to take a relaxed photo, I felt ridiculous,\
  \ I settled to take a photo of the unbelievable views. Was this agony really worth\
  \ it? Some of the kids would stop and watch me with my selfie stick and giggle.\
  \ I didn\u2019t understand if they were really giggling at me or just in the joy\
  \ of the moment; they spoke in Euskara, not Castilian, as was common to say in the\
  \ Basque Country, instead of calling it Spanish.\n\nNevertheless, their giggling\
  \ egged me on, and I thought, if they can get up there running, then I can also\
  \ get to the top. I was already halfway up, but I looked down the daunting stairs,\
  \ thinking again, I could just turn back; I had taken enough pictures to say that\
  \ I was here. I looked up at the chapel, and heard someone else ring the bell three\
  \ times. \n\nI had a task to complete. Before I made my way down to the islet, my\
  \ guide, Igor, told me that, San Juan de Gaztelugatxe had a chapel at the top and\
  \ visitors who get to the chapel ring the bell three times. He clarified; this has\
  \ always been a popular spot and only recently got more attention after Game of\
  \ Thrones. He added that the tradition was similar to throwing the coin in the Trevi\
  \ Fountain in Rome. I wanted to ring the bell at the chapel and I wanted to get\
  \ to the top of Dragon Stone! \n\nI got up and continued my overwhelming climb up\
  \ those stairs. It was incredible and I felt such delight for my accomplishment\
  \ when I got to the top! I walked around, and took in the breathtaking views. As\
  \ I took my turn to ring the bell, there was an unexpected moment afterward, as\
  \ I was taking another selfie, a bunch of the kids before they left, got behind\
  \ me and we wordlessly agreed to cheer as I took the shot. \n\nAfter they left,\
  \ I took a seat, and looked out to the mountain I left behind to get to this islet,\
  \ and mentally prepared myself to get back to Igor. I felt so much more confident\
  \ descending the stairs back to the path. I had a bounce in my step!\n\nEarlier,\
  \ when we arrived to the drop off point for San Juan de Gaztelugatxe, Igor told\
  \ me that I had to walk down a path because they didn\u2019t allow cars to drive\
  \ to the steps. The walk was pretty easy, and as the stairs to the Islet got closer\
  \ I gained more speed and enthusiasm. Now, as I climbed back up the hill my energy\
  \ would occasionally knock out. I was winded and had to take several breaks along\
  \ the way. It hadn\u2019t occurred to me in all the excitement that I was going\
  \ to have to walk up the steep path to get back, no giggles of support to help me\
  \ along.\n\nI felt another kind push, urgency, to get back as the sun was setting.\
  \ I had so much more to go, I was alone, feeling shaky, and tired; I took another\
  \ moment to collect myself before I continued to make my way. As I sat, I looked\
  \ out and saw the little Islet with its winding 240 steps, and laughed at my own\
  \ exhaustion. I didn\u2019t anticipate such a physically challenging task. Eventually,\
  \ I managed to get back and when I finally saw Igor\u2019s car I was relieved and\
  \ proud that I pushed myself through that little adventure full of personal challenges,\
  \ with some help along the way."
