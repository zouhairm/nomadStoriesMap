Text: "I am perching on a set of two thousand-year-old stairs, looking over an array\
  \ of viewpoints in the city. More importantly I am harbouring that celestial warmth\
  \ in the eve of spring, watching families and tourists climbing and immersing in\
  \ history as they become part of it. As I block out the blaring sounds from below,\
  \ I start to focus on my hand, holding the pen in my own way, the very pen writing\
  \ these words. I become very aware of my hand and the pale crisp skin covering it.\
  \ I notice the creases and wrinkles, criss-crossing and indenting it, pondering\
  \ on their significance. \nI feel like you can tell a lot about a person\u2019s\
  \ past experience, suffering and joy from their hands. I know I have burns from\
  \ previous work in the kitchen, even a blister where my index finger and palm touch\
  \ from playing tennis last week. It\u2019s interesting because we use our hands\
  \ in almost all activities, even when walking and sleeping they are still moving,\
  \ to aid us and protect us. They are vital to human expression, whether that be\
  \ a simple greeting or a full empowered gesticulation, one single twitch could change\
  \ a word, all action\u2019s hold meaning. Since living in Jordan, I have become\
  \ accustomed to reading hand movements as a substitute to me understanding Arabic\
  \ fluently. I\u2019ve noticed how important hand gestures and greetings are especially\
  \ in the welcoming custom of hospitality in Arab culture here. Simply by shaking\
  \ hand, you\u2019ve crossed a barrier from being more than just an acquaintance\
  \ to a good friendship. This concept of friendship and love is fostered and endeavoured\
  \ highly here in Jordan; and hands are the initial bearers of this tradition.\n\
  A handshake although formal is a universal sign of acceptance. A skin on skin contact,\
  \ an exchange of experiences. That first feeling that defines the nature of your\
  \ forthcoming relationship. If someone is nervous you can either feel the unsteadiness\
  \ as their fingers curl around your palm. A lot of the time strength and confidence\
  \ are thought to be two important factors when meeting someone. However, such is\
  \ the misguidance of dominance and the comparison to integrity, when overcompensation\
  \ does not covert but only reflects lack thereof. There are benefits and downsides\
  \ to greetings, such as handshakes, as they are one of the many elements in self\
  \ presentation that can be falsified. The best example is demonstrated in the term\
  \ \u201CToxic masculinity\u201D. This ancient idea of power of oneself, purely deriving\
  \ from physical strength and overt confidence damages the vulnerability of human\
  \ connection. \u201CToughness\u201D is not conventional, a lot of it has to do with\
  \ experience but more so with how you\u2019ve learnt to deal with this experience.\
  \ Life isn\u2019t a Greek tragedy, where we rise and then fall to our fatal flaw\
  \ in the end. \u201CToughness\u201D is your approach to the many ups and downs,\
  \ to holding onto lasting hope and to accepting all your weaknesses. \nEvery day\
  \ I walk over this bridge and every morning I see a woman sat cross legged on a\
  \ thin blanket. She sits outside all day every day, laying out all her goods to\
  \ sell. Without a doubt, she herself as been through a lot and you can see that\
  \ in the creases around her eyes. Yet everyday she the bears the whipping wind,\
  \ the lashing rain and the unforgiving sun, for her livelihood. She greets me with\
  \ open arms and smiling, as if every day is anew. Some mornings I shake her hand\
  \ and I feel her battered soul as her rough skin comes into contact with mine. Through\
  \ this simple gesture she guides me through her past; not afraid of her dark corners\
  \ or weaker slants. By accepting these components of oneself, you don\u2019t have\
  \ hide, you don\u2019t have to squeeze your grip harder, because you cannot measure\
  \ \u201Ctoughness\u201D or hardship but you can make that initial local connection."
