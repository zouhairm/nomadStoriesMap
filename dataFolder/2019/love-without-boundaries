Text: "As me and my husband walked down a busy street of Myeong dong, we couldn\u2019\
  t help but wonder how homogeneous the crowd is- in Seoul. It was our third day here,\
  \ and we had done all the touristy stuff- visit Buddhist temples, climb the Namsan\
  \ tower, go clubbing in Gangnam, visit the cosmetic markets but not seen a single\
  \ foreigner. We were told a huge US population lives in South Korea as they still\
  \ have an army here. \n\nIt was our first time in Seoul, but I could tell something\
  \ about this place was special. I loved everything about the city- the vibe of the\
  \ city, it\u2019s people (they are the best), the food, and the Korean pop culture.\
  \ It\u2019s been long since I found a city I enjoyed so much.\nWe started our fourth\
  \ morning looking for closest Indian restaurant. I was missing home food and I have\
  \ always loved experiencing Indian food around the world. It is always fascinating\
  \ to see non Indians enjoying the food, how they relate to it, what they like and\
  \ what they don\u2019t, and how for most of the world Indian food means- curry!\n\
  We found one restaurant in a busy market lane in Insadong- Indoro. We went there\
  \ during lunch and a part of me was hoping to see one familiar (Indian) face there.\
  \ To our surprise the restaurant was managed by a Korean guy who had lived in India\
  \ for 10 years. He loved the food in India so much that he decided to open this\
  \ restaurant when he moved back. The staff was also local. It was a nice sweet place,\
  \ decorated with Indian handicrafts. We were attended by a young Korean guy who\
  \ was more than happy to take us through their menu, and recommend their best dishes.\
  \ \n\nAfter he finished serving us, he came to us and asked us if we were from India.\
  \ The moment we said yes, he told us-\nNamaste, main Seoul university me hindi ka\
  \ chatra hu. Mera Korean naam Sam yong hai and hindi ka naam Sudhir. Yeh naam mujhe\
  \ mere adhyapak ne diya. Mujhe bharaat bohot pasand hai. Main kabhi bharaat ja nahi\
  \ paaya. Par ek din main zaroor jaunga aur waha kuch business karna chahoonge. Isiliye\
  \ main hindi seekh raha hoon and Indian restaurant me kaam kar raha hoon.\n\n(Hi,\
  \ I am a Hindi language student in Seoul University. My Korean name is Sam Yong\
  \ and Indian name is Sudhir. My language teacher gave me that name. I love India.\
  \ I haven\u2019t been able to visit the country yet. But I hope to visit it soon\
  \ and do some business there. My love for India is the reason why I am learning\
  \ the Hindi language and working in an Indian restaurant)\n\nI was speechless by\
  \ the individual\u2019s passionate love for a country he is nowhere related to or\
  \ has never visited. 3500 miles away from India, that day this Korean guy made me\
  \ realize the true meaning of love without boundaries. He made my day by his simplicity\
  \ and dedication. \nI gave him my contact, invited him to India and I sincerely\
  \ hope his dream realizes soon. \n\nKamsa hamida Sudhir, for reminding me it is\
  \ okay to dream big!!"
