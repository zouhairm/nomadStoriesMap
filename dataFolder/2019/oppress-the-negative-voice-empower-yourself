Text: "You know that dreadful feeling of being really nervous? Your chin chatters,\
  \ your hands get a little clammy and your feet can't seem to rest in one spot. It's\
  \ overwhelming and there is a persistent voice in your head trying so hard to turn\
  \ you on your heels, back to your comfort zone. Then you take it - a leap of faith\
  \ into the unknown and it turns out that ignoring the negative voice is the best\
  \ decision you can make. \n\nMy story starts pre-sunrise on a September morning\
  \ at Dublin airport. The wind blew my hair onto my face and I knew I wouldn't feel\
  \ that wind for a long time again. In that moment, I thought of all the things I\
  \ would miss like my home, my family and my friends. Nevertheless, I ignored the\
  \ relentless voice in my head and I boarded a flight to begin a new journey on my\
  \ Erasmus exchange year to Croatia. I could never have possibly imagined what exactly\
  \ awaited at the other side of that flight or what the year ahead had in store,\
  \ but by disregarding the sweaty nervous hands and the swirling thoughts in my head,\
  \ I actually gave myself the chance to find out.  It is likely that at this point\
  \ you are predicting another clich\xE9 story where the conflicted girl gets on the\
  \ plane and her life changes forever. Well, you are somewhat right, but there is\
  \ someone else I would like you to meet. \n\nLet me introduce to you the voice in\
  \ my head, one which I gave a male persona and a name to, naturally. Gareth is his\
  \ name (for no particular reason) and he represents the fears and insecurities in\
  \ my head. I imagine him as being a really short guy, yet his arms are pretty toned\
  \ so he appears strong on the outside. Gareth loves his home comforts and he feels\
  \ like a cool lad in his tiny world. He has his group of friends and a great job\
  \ so he is generally happy, yet deep down he feels he is missing something in life,\
  \ never daring to admit it. Truth is, he is super scared. Scared of flying, of new\
  \ surroundings,  of making eye contact with new people and scared of leaving home.\
  \ Ultimately, he is very much scared of the words 'change' and 'new'. Gareth just\
  \ wants to stay comfortable. Typical buzz-kill. The point is, we all have a voice\
  \ like Gareth  in our head who tries to convince us to stay where you and him are\
  \ both at ease. This voice does not define who you are and it should not be allowed\
  \ to scare you away from new beginnings.\n\nYou see, if I had listened to Gareth\
  \ in the airport that morning I would never have seen how the sun shone in Zadar\
  \ and how the Adriatic water glistened in the sunlight. I would have stayed in Dublin\
  \ and never walked along the stony beaches on my way home from University morning\
  \ and evening. I wouldn't know that 3 hours is the standard amount of time to spend\
  \ sipping over coffee in Croatian cafes nor would I have tasted Rakija (a mind-numbing\
  \ local liquor).  If I stayed home, I would not have had in-depth discussions about\
  \ the Yugoslavian war as I did with great friends there. Most importantly, if I\
  \ had stayed home, I would not have truly immersed myself  in a new culture, a new\
  \ society and a new way of life. What became clear to me was not only was I experiencing\
  \ a new place but I was experiencing a new version of myself, one I never knew existed\
  \ and one which Gareth was terrified to meet. \n\nBefore this ends, and if you are\
  \ somewhat crazy like me, I advise you to take a moment to name your own fearful\
  \ subconscious voice. Think of the times when it stopped you from doing what you\
  \ always wanted to do. Get mad at it. Acknowledge how powerful it is, and then remind\
  \ yourself how much stronger you are. Do what you dream of doing and don't let your\
  \ own personal version of Gareth stop you from getting there."
