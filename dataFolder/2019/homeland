Text: "\u201CTraveling \u2013 it leaves you speechless, then turns you into a storyteller.\u201D\
  \ \u2013 Ibn Battuta\nI would love to grab this golden opportunity as it knocks\
  \ to apply for the 2019 travel writing scholarship to Portugal so that to fuel my\
  \ wanderlust once again and relieve the ennui after some stressful years. My traveling\
  \ experience is limited by a couple of overseas trips to the UK in May 2007 as a\
  \ tourist, Russia in June 2010 visiting relatives just after the ethnic clashes\
  \ that affected my hometown Osh, it turned into a devastated area within just two\
  \ days, actually I was evacuated first to the capital Bishkek, and Turkey in August\
  \ 2014 on a business trip spending most of the time at the head office. Those were\
  \ rather exciting leaps into the unknown leaving marks on my memory and heart. \n\
  I am from a mountainous, nomad post-soviet country. It has many beauty spots worth\
  \ visiting. So I decided to climb that goddamn mountains, enjoy the waterfalls,\
  \ streams and turquoise lakes coz in the end, you won\u2019t remember the time you\
  \ spent working in the office, cooking or planting flowers in your front garden.\
  \ Just go and see! I traveled across the country through mountain valleys like Susamyr\
  \ spending holidays at our famous Issyl-Kol Lake, on the way stopping at the Naryn\
  \ river, Toktogul man-made lake, Chychkan gorge, highest mountain passes, Fairytale\
  \ canyon resembling Mars surface, Jety Oguz gorge with its breathtaking seven sandstone\
  \ rocks. On the approach to Jeti Oguz there is another rock formation that looks\
  \ like a broken heart. I remember it was hailing when I was passing by that place.\
  \ There are many national parks and nature reserves in my country and I still visited\
  \ just four. Ala-Archa national park was founded to protect the mountain river of\
  \ the same name. The fresh water was so cold almost icy that I only managed to slightly\
  \ moisten my hands and face. There are famous peaks and glaciers there Mount Komsomolets\
  \ and Peak Semyonova Tianshanski. It is really a very popular place for hiking and\
  \ trekking. By the way the name of this national park comes from Kyrgyz word for\
  \ treelike juniper archa, a plant that is burned to remove bad spirits from houses.\
  \ Lake Issyk-Kol is part of the Issyk-Kol biosphere nature reserve the first one\
  \ that was founded long time ago in 1948 to protect the wetlands around the lake.\
  \ In fact, a large variety of ecosystems are represented in the reserve, from deserts\
  \ to mountains to marshlands. The reserve is also home to some endangered species,\
  \ including the Marco Polo sheep, the Siberian ibex, snow leopards, and Tian Shan\
  \ brown bears. The next comes Sary-Chelek biosphere nature reserve with its pearl\
  \ an alpine lake of the same name, which is only seven hours drive from my home\
  \ place, however, I visited it for the first and only time with my expat friends\
  \ who worked in Osh for international NGOs in August 31, 2012 just on Kyrgyzstan\u2019\
  s independence day. It is definitely the place of eternal bliss and pleasure. The\
  \ untouched nature, stunning views of pine forests, crystal clear waters of the\
  \ lake, mountain air and its remoteness from civilization inspired me and gave the\
  \ feeling of joy and serenity.  We spent the whole day there hiking, had a short\
  \ boat trip. Swimming and fishing is banned. In the evening we returned to the family\
  \ guest house in the village not far from the national park. The only thing that\
  \ upset me, I noticed some piles of garbage, mostly plastic that was not disposed.\
  \ It is an acute and pressing problem in my country recycling and proper garbage\
  \ disposal due to lack of funds, technologies and careless attitude of local people.\
  \ The gorges of Kyrgyz-Ata national park are located 40 km to the south of my native\
  \ town Osh and I often visit them to enjoy the picturesque scenes. Though I traveled\
  \ to most of the beautiful places of my home country, some are still left like the\
  \ Son-Kol Lake with its yurt camps in the Naryn region, climbing Lenin Peak, and\
  \ wandering in other national parks sophisticatedly named to fill my soul in close\
  \ unity with nature."
