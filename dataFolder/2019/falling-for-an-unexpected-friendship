Text: "Brisk air sliced my lungs as I gasped, standing in a shallow crease of the\
  \ Ho\xE0ng Li\xEAn Son Mountains. The sun was masked by cool, grey Vietnamese atmosphere,\
  \ but sweat still beaded under my hiking clothes. \n\nMy only hope as I clung to\
  \ an exposed root protruding from the muddied mountain slope was a gap-toothed smile\
  \ and a pair of teasing brown eyes staring at me with pity. A smirk widened across\
  \ the tanned face of an elderly Hmong woman, proudly weathered from a lifetime of\
  \ trekking the same path our tour group followed now. The hike was a walk in the\
  \ park to her. For me, this was one of the hardest physical challenges I had attempted.\n\
  \nTo my ashamed relief, she held out her hand. Coyly releasing myself from the tree\
  \ root, I reached back and felt the reassurance of her grip on my wrist. \n\n\u201C\
  Thank you,\u201D I breathed as we both nodded at each other in agreement. We were\
  \ going to ascend this mountain, together. \n\nHand-in-hand, she anchored our body\
  \ weight with a crooked walking stick and peeled my sandaled feet from the sinking\
  \ mud. We looked ahead, following the distant sounds of laughter descending from\
  \ girls in my tour group and the other Hmong women leading the way. Our destination\
  \ was the Ta Van Hill Tribe Village, but the only goal in sight was reaching the\
  \ summit peak. \n\nSwiftly, yet strategically, she maneuvered the craters and valleys\
  \ dipping in the thick mud. Her petite foot pressed indentations into the forest\
  \ floor for my size 9 hooves to fill. When I found the courage to look up from my\
  \ mud-caked feet, my stare fell to her gorgeous multicolored garbs, marked by not\
  \ one splash of mud. She knew the land, and the land knew her. \n\nAt times, she\
  \ would let go of my hand and we'd walk in mutual quiet past water buffalo wading\
  \ in swampy ponds, dead rice paddies and miles of bamboo. Separated by an unbreakable\
  \ language barrier, our only forms of communication were smiling, nodding and hand\
  \ grabbing. Afraid to hurt her feeble body, I attempted to do as much of the trek\
  \ on my own as I could. After all, I was an able-bodied 22-year-old woman who hit\
  \ the gym once a week. I should not need a woman the same age as my grandmother\
  \ to pull me up and over a Vietnamese mountain.\n\n\u201CI can do it,\u201D I said\
  \ as my stubbornness overtook sense. We had hit a downward slope in the path, too\
  \ narrow to hold hands and trek side by side. She hesitantly nodded, continuing\
  \ ahead with her walking stick. Worrying, I could see her peering back at me. She\
  \ watched with careful concern as I scaled the deepening gully, gripping every tree\
  \ root I could find. The mud got thicker. And thicker. And I insisted she keep going.\
  \ \n\n\u201CI'm okay,\u201D I smiled and eagerly nodded. I was determined to not\
  \ need her help. But, she knew better. She slowed her pace to keep an eye on me.\
  \ So when I felt my body begin to flail, she was conveniently nearby. \n\nThe wet,\
  \ rubber bottom of my sandal hit the mud like oil as I clambered down the steeping\
  \ slope. Losing my balance, the woman, whom I now considered my personal savior,\
  \ lunged and grabbed my arm, catching my fall. \n\nFeeling hot with fear and embarrassment,\
  \ I forced a smile at her from a blushing face. She only nodded and held on. \n\n\
  So we held on and walked in single file. One step. Two steps. Three...\n\nThere\
  \ was no saving either of us from the fall. My foot hit and slipped, arms flailed,\
  \ legs buckled, shrieks pierced the air, and hand-in-hand we both went bottoms-first\
  \ into the muddy gully.\n\nOur eyes met, shocked, after landing. And then the silence\
  \ broke with laughter. In this moment, two women separated by language, culture,\
  \ unknown names and decades of age, could not have been closer. We were suddenly\
  \ connected by a split second of fear, equal determination, shared embarrassment,\
  \ uncontrollable laughter, two feet of mud and soiled bottoms, and instant friendship.\n\
  \nAnd later that day, muddied and exhausted, we reached the summit, together."
