Text: "How I came to find myself in Peru, exploring it by foot, car, bus and a train\
  \ alongside a red raging River Urubamba dates back to 2016.   February is a rainy\
  \ season here.  The rivers are a sight as they fill and rage along to feed directly\
  \ into the Amazon.  I had had an overnight transit in Lima, Peru from Sao Paulo,\
  \ Brazil on my way to meet up with a friend in Havanna, Cuba.  Now Cuba had been\
  \ on my bucket list for as long as I learnt about how it gave so much of its sons\
  \ and daughters to fight and die for us Africans in liberation wars.  Coincidentally,\
  \ while I was there I woke up one morning to the news of Castro\u2019s demise. \
  \  Watching the country mourn and rejoice was a mind bending experience.  He was\
  \ a hero to some and dictator to others.\nBack to the night I transited in Lima,\
  \ I had walked past a large wall to wall picture of thick green majestic mountains\
  \ and ruins of Machu Picchu.   I was mesmerised by this picture.  It stopped me\
  \ on my track and since I had the whole night of waiting for my connecting flight\
  \ I stopped and took in the picture.  I felt it calling and I knew without a doubt\
  \ that I will be back here and I will walk those ruins.  This is not anything new\
  \ for me - that is - to feel and accept without question that in future I will be\
  \ back to a place.  I just didn\u2019t know it would be so soon.   Africa has that\
  \ same magic of calling non-Africans to it for an experience.  South America has\
  \ it too.   It chooses and calls because I found myself reading on its magic for\
  \ days. \nTravelling has taught me to not take the word of collective stereotypes\
  \ about the any place.  Like grandmothers, my continent of Africa is known as dark\
  \ and mysterious; diseased and dangerous; overpopulated and crime ridden.  The South\
  \ American continent is also known for its Amazon jungle that is dark and mysterious;\
  \ dangerous creatures and diseased; drug den and crime ridden.  I found quite the\
  \ opposite.   Gentle souls who work the land from dawn to dusk.  I found sweet merchants\
  \ in the markets who made it pleasant to bargain for wares.   While money was needed\
  \ because off course it makes the world go round, I felt people enjoy bantering\
  \ and bargaining.   They took their time too, explaining how they dye their clothes\
  \ with natural dyes from specific plants.   Their country is blessed with mineral\
  \ stones like ours.  I have never seen so many beautiful crystals, each crafted\
  \ to perfection but affordable.  African mineral stones are inaccessible though\
  \ and they cost one\u2019s soul.  \nFar from romanticising these two continents,\
  \ I am aware that the gentle giant that is Africa can swallow you whole and spit\
  \ you out pulverised should you come to it naively and so can South America too.\
  \  The opposite can happen too, its trees and enchanted bird songs took my angst\
  \ filled, toxin laden and anxious self warmly embraced it and cleansed it free;\
  \ bits put together to be made whole.  That\u2019s the mystery of these misunderstood\
  \ dichotomised continents.  \nThe only time I felt the sharp toothed side of Peru\
  \ was when I landed and the taxi wanted to charge me double the prize I had been\
  \ advised I will pay.   I was tired after a long trip of transiting but I was also\
  \ annoyed.  I looked him in the eye and raised my eyebrow.  He knew I knew that\
  \ he was ripping me off.  He wanted to play bargain and I had no time so I turned\
  \ back to the airport.  A sweet lady manning the information desk came to my rescue.\
  \  We bargained until I got a reasonable prize because I told her I knew the prices\
  \ for a 45 kilometre trip.   I got into a taxi and the driver was short, I figured\
  \ if he tries anything I stand a chance of fighting him.  I don\u2019t know if men\
  \ think of these things when they find themselves alone in a taxi with a stranger.\
  \    Sleepiness was gone I was alert looking at every corner we turned until I saw\
  \ the board indicating Pisac, I sighed relief.   This man was not going to chop\
  \ me into pieces.    Thus goes the mind of a city girl who has read many a story\
  \ of misogynistic lost souls."
