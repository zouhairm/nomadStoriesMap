Text: "\"I've always depended on the kindness of strangers\".. these words, that were\
  \ made famous by Blanche Debois (aka Vivian Leigh) in the film \"A Streetcar named\
  \ Desire\" always come to my mind when I remember certain situations I've been through,\
  \ chief among them the following one. \nThe year was 2013 and I was in Brussels\
  \ for a 4-day, EU sponsored conference when I decided to steal some time in order\
  \ to see some of the city's landmarks. Having already been to Grand Place, Manniken\
  \ Pis and the Magritte Museum, I've decided my next destination would be the Atomium.\
  \ Despite the fact that I had so little time, I decided to walk to the Atomium,\
  \ which was 8 Kilometers away from my hotel, just because I wanted to feast my eyes\
  \ on the beautiful, awe-inspiring architecture along away. But this has proven a\
  \ much harder task than I thought. \nIt's easy to lose yourself in a city like Brussels,\
  \ with its narrow, cobbled streets and its dazzling shop displays. After a while\
  \ I found myself wandering aimlessly and obviously completely lost. I got out my\
  \ mobile to consult google maps as to where I am and how I should proceed, only\
  \ to find that my mobile's battery died and I had forgotten my charger in my room.\
  \ Sitting on a bench, I thought through how to go about doing this, and after a\
  \ while I got up and started asking people around for directions to the Atomium.\
  \ People kept giving me different instructions and I found myself losing my way\
  \ further. But then someone patted me on the back and when I turned, I saw a man\
  \ in his late twenties or early thirties smiling at me and talking to me in Arabic\
  \ (my mother tongue).  I was astonished and I asked him how did he figure out that\
  \ I'm an Arab speaking person. He smiled and told me he had a gut feeling. I asked\
  \ him for specific directions on how to get to the Atomium and he explained to me\
  \ how to get there on foot. Then he said  \"you know what. I work in a restaurant\
  \ and I just got off my shift. How about I give you a ride?\". Now as grateful as\
  \ I was for his help, I wasn't too keen on the idea of getting in a car with a complete\
  \ stranger. But for some odd reason instead of saying no thank you, I ended up saying\
  \ \"why not\". He excused himself and went to bring his car and I stood there with\
  \ half a mind to just run away and mentally berating myself for agreeing to this.\
  \ He brought the car and I nervously got in before he took off. He must've sensed\
  \ my tension because he attempted to break the ice by introducing himself \"I'm\
  \ Murad and I'm from Morocco\". His face lit up when I told him that I'm from Egypt\
  \ and he began asking me questions about how are things in Egypt now after the revolution?\
  \ I slowly calmed down as I began rambling on and on about what my country has been\
  \ through for the last couple of years. He was listening attentively, only interrupting\
  \ me when we pass by an important landmark. He would tell me a brief history about\
  \ said landmark before asking me to continue my story. My fears of being kidnapped,\
  \ murdered or raped faded completely and before long I found myself staring at the\
  \ Atomium as his car stopped. I looked at the towering architectural structure in\
  \ wonder and then looked at Murad in gratitude. He smiled warmly as he shook my\
  \ hand, told me he was honored to meet me, wished me and my country luck and gave\
  \ me his phone number in case I needed anything.  As I got off the car and waved\
  \ goodbye, I was filled with an overwhelming feeling of bliss and unwavering certainty\
  \ that this was no chance meeting; this was God's helping hand stretched out to\
  \ me in the form of a kind stranger."
