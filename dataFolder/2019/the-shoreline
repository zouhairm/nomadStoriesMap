Text: "The baby\u2019s head was visible through a hole in the sand about the size\
  \ of a Canadian dime. She was asleep; hatched days earlier alongside her brothers\
  \ and sisters under the sand, in the nest where their mother left them. \n\nWe waited.\
  \ She did not stir. Jon, the only marine biologist in camp at the time, explained\
  \ that it is unusual for young sea turtles to leave their nests during the day.\
  \ She would probably not break for the water until night fell. In the dark, her\
  \ odds were better. It was less likely that she\u2019d get picked off by a seabird,\
  \ or by one of the monitor lizards sometimes spotted from the walking paths that\
  \ wound through the rainforest on Lang Tengah.  \n\nHer nest was hidden in the shade.\
  \ Just a thirty-second walk to the water - if you were over five feet tall and walked\
  \ on two legs. For the sleeping baby, storing up her energy, the stretch of beach\
  \ between the nest and the sea could mean the difference between living and dying.\n\
  \n\u201CHow do they know which way to go \u2013 to get to the water?\u201D \n\n\u201C\
  They crawl towards the brightest light source,\u201D Jon said. He told a story about\
  \ a time -before I was on the island- when a lamp was left on in the camp kitchen\
  \ at night. A volunteer found a pair of baby turtles on the cinderblocks under the\
  \ light, having pulled their little bodies uphill through tree roots in the opposite\
  \ direction of the water. \n\nI was in Malaysia as a student on exchange for four\
  \ months, come to tell a story about the relationship between journalism and power\
  \ in a country that had a long history of censorship. As far as I knew, journalists\
  \ were not killed in Malaysia, but the beaches they had to cross to reach the shores\
  \ of information and truth could still be treacherous. \n\nOnly one out of 1,000\
  \ baby sea turtles make it to adulthood.  \n\nSitting as dusk sank into the night,\
  \ waiting for the nest to burst, Jon\u2019s storytelling was cut short \u2013 there\
  \ was something in the trees behind us. He left and then returned a moment later,\
  \ beaming, telling us to come but not to make too much noise either.\n\nThere was\
  \ a nesting mother. \n\nShe settled in the sand and the roots of the trees behind\
  \ where Wilson and Peal sat on the beach. She threw sand with her flippers, ground\
  \ out the earth for her nest. We watched her from a distance, headlamps turned to\
  \ red. \n\nThe Turtle Watch on Lang Tengah are tender holders of the beaches there.\
  \ They organize trash cleanups and protect the turtles \u2013 from both poachers\
  \ and tourists. A part of the work that they do is science-based; collecting data,\
  \ keeping track of the turtles who return to nest on the island every year, counting\
  \ the number of unsuccessful eggs in a clutch after a hatching. \n\nI almost missed\
  \ it \u2013 the night the baby finally went. I was asleep after my night watch,\
  \ when I heard my friend Hannah shout. There was enough moonlight that I did not\
  \ need my headlamp to see. I knew camp well enough to pick my way to the nest without\
  \ breaking any toes. The baby struggled in the sand, flippers flailing for purchase,\
  \ so small she would have fit in the palm of my hand.\n\nThere were five of us there;\
  \ a marine biologist and four volunteers, all of us holding our breath for this\
  \ baby.  She was the only one left- clutches usually go together, a sudden swell\
  \ of black specs across white sand, launching themselves into the sea. They have\
  \ better odds that way; not all of them end up somebody else\u2019s midnight snack.\n\
  \nWe followed her, the sound of the tide licking at the beach, this tiny sea turtle\
  \ alone in the world except for our excited cheering. She caught the edge of the\
  \ water and rode it away from us; into a world that was much bigger than she was,\
  \ as I would have to when it came time for me to brave the shoreline."
