Text: "Actually, in the beginning of this story, every person from my country would\
  \ laugh. Why? Because I'm a Latvian. And every basic Latvian goes to Estonia or\
  \ Lithuania in summer holidays holidays. When we talk about the countries we have\
  \ visited in life - we always count in our neighbour countries in default because\
  \ it is complete mainstream. But I guess it's the same story withe every country,\
  \ altough, maybe a little different since we, Baltic states are so close that sometimes\
  \ it almost feels like we are just one big Baltic country. So, that's why my story\
  \ at the beginning would sound silly - because I found something that I wouldn't\
  \ expect to find in our northern neighbour country - Estonia!\nEstonia has always\
  \ been different from the rest two of Baltic states. They are different in mentality,\
  \ I would say. Since Soviet times already, there were always the feeling that you\
  \ are abroud while being in Estonia. In foreign country. Somewhere with better quality\
  \ of life, with higher development etc. History tells that the reason why our so\
  \ called \"slower brothers\" are better developed because they were lucky to somehow\
  \ escape from the impact of iron curtain and grab a piece of the pie of west space\
  \ of information.But it is not what I'm going to say - the whole meaning is that\
  \ Estonia has always been a good place to visit. BUT everyone, usually does that\
  \ at the age of 9, together with parents and after that this place takes the very\
  \ last place of the bucket list. \nActually I was laughing when my friend, with\
  \ that adventurous spark in the eyes told me that we just have to visit Tallinn\
  \ for one day. I was like \"okay, for the 10th time\". Boring.\nHis one and only\
  \ advantage that helped me to get off from the bed was the fact that I had nothing\
  \ better to do. Okay. And here it goes, the trip of two persons - one is too excited\
  \ of having it and one, completely not interested. \nAnd we can travel in the future.\
  \ In the nearest future after two hours. And we are here, in Tallinn. It was a surprise\
  \ walk to some place in the Tallinn that I was almost completely sure I have visited.\
  \ But you know. I was more than surprised because I've been to this place like millinon\
  \ times but he showed me something new. Short description - old school buildings,\
  \ proffesional graffiti paintings on the fasades of the builings, dosens of hipsters\
  \ and super cute cafe's. I think I just fell in love with the aura of this place.\
  \ Just close your eyes and imagine entereing in this district of Tallinn. It's called\
  \ Telliskivi. And you walk in. Grey, gloomy buildings. But with super detailed drawings\
  \ of elephants that seems like being alive. Like just going to take a step out of\
  \ the building walls. And the full zoo of graffiti animals. Abandoned train cabins\
  \ and cozy waffle places and coffee shops in each of them. the smell of fresh latte\
  \ that follows a girl with pink hair that is completely contrasting with crashed\
  \ railway that she is crossing. Magical. \nIn the way home I was completely embarassed.\
  \ It was so deceptive to think that there is nothing secial in this place. In every\
  \ place you can find something so special. If only... If only you explore with with\
  \ interest and are ready to go further. Visit unusual places. And have experience\
  \ you won't be able to forget."
