Text: "The journey to the other side of the world had naked me as nothing than a dust\
  \ in the universe.\n\nAs everyone chanting their prayer we all circled around anticlockwise\
  \ \u2013a ritual called Tawaf. In the middle of the ocean of circling people stood\
  \ beautifully and magnificently was Ka\u2019bah. I never really thought that I would\
  \ really be one day praying in front of Ka\u2019bah, stood in the sacred land of\
  \ Makkah, with tears flowing on my cheeks like heavy rain. All of the past coming\
  \ through me like fluid water. The mistakes, the broken relationships, the failures,\
  \ the underachieved dreams. But, also the best moments of my life came to my eyes\
  \ to remind me to say \u201Calhamdulillah\u201D \u2013thank God for the blessing\
  \ You\u2019ve given to me all this time. Probably million people there, just like\
  \ me, were doing the same thing, talking to God, wanting to be embraced deeply by\
  \ Him. \n\nLife was never been easy. When I was younger, I sometimes put myself\
  \ as the center of the universe too much. When something went wrong in my life,\
  \ I might blame everything I could blame for. I sometimes forgot that it was me\
  \ who was wrong, not everyone else. As I got older I realized everything that happened\
  \ in our life was the way universe worked its wonder \u2013its magic. God was the\
  \ one who had made the scenario, sometimes thrilling or comedic. However, in the\
  \ end God always gave me the best I needed, though not what I always wanted.\n\n\
  Earlier that year on January 2018 before going to perform umrah I had achieved my\
  \ Master of Arts. I was majoring in Literature Study, especially English Literature.\
  \ I had worked super hard for two years to achieve the degree. I pushed myself to\
  \ my limit, to realize that I actually had nothing at all except God\u2019s will\
  \ and help. I worked on writing my thesis for a semester and I finally got to defense\
  \ it. It was an intense thesis defense but God showed it the way and guided me to\
  \ finish it, though not pretty well, but good enough to achieve an A mark. In that\
  \ room I realized that God, my Allah, had just shown His face to me. He had just\
  \ shown me His power that I could never imagine. When He showed His mercy it felt\
  \ almost like I did not realize I existed at all. The existence was Allah Himself.\n\
  \nWhen we were doing Tawaf, I had felt the connection I felt when I was in that\
  \ thesis defense room back in my university. I felt like nothing surrounded by hundreds\
  \ \u2013million\u2013 people in Masjidil Haram, in front of Ka\u2019bah. I was chanting\
  \ the Qur\u2019an verse to thank Allah for all the blessing in my life together\
  \ with so many people. We were just like dots, like dust, in this big universe.\
  \ I could smell the sweat of people next to me, I could hear their breaths, and\
  \ I did not feel different at all with them although we had different skin colors\
  \ and languages. We were magically similar in diversity. Like I was brown dust,\
  \ she was blue dust, and he was green dust. In the end we were all dust and that\
  \ did not matter at all. \n\nAfter Tawaf, we had ritual of walking from Safa to\
  \ Marwah hills seven times called Sa\u2019i. That was such a tough ritual making\
  \ me imagining how hard for Hajar to run back to back from both hills in order finding\
  \ water for his son, Ismail a.s. When I felt how tired my legs walking and sometimes\
  \ running during Sa\u2019i, I noticed that doing life was just like doing this ritual:\
  \ need a long run, perseverance and patience. Nothing else we needed to accomplish\
  \ life besides those three wisdoms from Sa\u2019i I could sum up. We might be just\
  \ a dust in this universe like we were just one from millions to circle Ka\u2019\
  bah but we were also alive and that was why we needed to be as tough as Hajar in\
  \ order to keep circling in harmony with others to live a full life given by Allah,\
  \ the God of the universe."
