Text: "The thick, humid air had dissipated to an eerie still. The incessant buzz of\
  \ scooters artfully dodging pedestrians as they weaved through city streets had\
  \ turned into the hushed tones of suburban gardens and walkways. Sparrows chirping\
  \ and flitting through trees were the only other signs of life along these increasingly\
  \ unnerving streets. A sudden wave of fear and paranoia quickly enveloped my body.\
  \ I grasped for my flimsy paper map, shared an anxious glance with my travelling\
  \ partner, then warily eyed the stranger who was guiding us.\n\nOnly moments ago\
  \ one could zoom in on my friend and I struggling with a map on a bustling street\
  \ corner in Taipei. We were unsuccessfully attempting to navigate ourselves to a\
  \ much-hyped market. Popular among young locals, only open seasonally, but largely\
  \ unknown to tourists. It had all the potential of indulging in rare finds, relishing\
  \ in local delicacies and bragging rights to visiting the latest hip location that\
  \ would make folks back home cringe with jealously. Amidst the confusion of our\
  \ furrowed brows, frustrated sighs and aimless pointing, an elderly man had gingerly\
  \ approached us. He maintained a slight distance, peered at us almost shyly, then\
  \ grunted at us in Taiwanese. We stared at him blankly like two children caught\
  \ quarrelling by their teacher. Then I pointed to our destination on the map. He\
  \ grunted again and beckoned us to follow him. He was already taking steps away\
  \ from us while my friend and I exchanged a quick look with one another before blindly\
  \ trailing after him. How friendly the Taiwanese are I thought. They sure do live\
  \ up to their reputation as really nice people I thought. No wonder everyone raves\
  \ about the people whenever they visit Taiwan I thought. Then my friend whispered\
  \ to me, \u2018Do you think he wants money?\u2019 Those six words set off a silent\
  \ alarm in my head that heightened my senses to our unfamiliar surroundings. The\
  \ vibrancy of the city had soon died down to the ominous calm of residential streets.\
  \ This is how we\u2019d ended up following this now suspicious guide.\n\nWe continued\
  \ on like this for another 5 minutes, exchanging worried glances and trying to clear\
  \ our panicked thoughts so we could think rationally about whether to continue following\
  \ or not. I buried my head into my paper map, trying to determine our location,\
  \ but my eyes continued to drift upward, sizing up our guide from behind. The man\
  \ looked harmless enough, but he was much bigger than us. While old, he looked fit\
  \ enough to take on either of us if it would come to that. He briefly looked back\
  \ at us. Our trying smiles masked our real thoughts. Should we throw caution aside?\
  \ Or should we ditch and run? Who is this guy? We know nothing about him. We didn\u2019\
  t even exchange names. With these thoughts and more reeling through my head, we\
  \ plodded along, pretending to admire the ornate architecture of passing buildings.\n\
  \nAnother 5 minutes passed, but it felt like much longer. Then, slowly, the quiet\
  \ lull of a Chinese lute broke the silence. The muffled murmurs of people emerged\
  \ from a distance. Behind a small grove, great white sails loomed, casting shadows\
  \ to relieve one from the sun. The enticing smell of traditional baked goods greeted\
  \ us. With mouths gaping and eyes drinking in the sights, we realised we\u2019d\
  \ reached our magical oasis. This must be how Christopher Columbus felt when he\
  \ first laid eyes on the abundant lands of the Americas. Our anxieties from only\
  \ moments before were long forgotten. In an entranced dazed, we wandered toward\
  \ this breathtaking utopia. Local vendors offering freshly brewed teas to our right,\
  \ Etsy-esque crafts boasting traditional patterns to our left, a line of people\
  \ in the distance disappearing into a chic caf\xE9 space selling bubble tea and\
  \ other tantalizing Taiwanese delights\u2026 Then we halted in our steps.\n\nOur\
  \ guide! But he was already disappearing into the throng of people along the street,\
  \ beyond the marketplace. We didn't have the opportunity to thank our guide, our\
  \ saviour, our friend with no name."
