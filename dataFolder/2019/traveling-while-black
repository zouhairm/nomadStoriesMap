Text: "I\u2019m not really \u201Cfrom\u201D anywhere\u2014at least not in the way\
  \ most people might experience this idea\u2014belonging to a place, having a particular\
  \ location one thinks of as home. I\u2019m a dual citizen of Nigeria and the U.S.,\
  \ yet I've been told by Nigerians that I'm not \"really Nigerian,\" and by xenophobic\
  \ Americans that I'm not \"really American.\" As one of the moving pieces in a far-flung\
  \ diaspora, I\u2019ve come to find it easier to think of myself as simply Black.\
  \ The more I travel, however, the more I realize that this particular identity exists\
  \ alongside a complex system of assumptions and perceptions far beyond my control.\
  \ Traveling while Black is often disorienting or downright bizarre: My skin always\
  \ adds another\u2014other\u2014layer to the experience. As a woman alone, I attract\
  \ some attention. And as a Black woman traveling alone, I\u2019m often an outright\
  \ curiosity. \n\nWhat I\u2018ve discovered during my travels is that my race serves,\
  \ conversely, as both an aversion and an invitation. It prompts avoidance as well\
  \ as intrusion. In places where the locals have had very few (or no) interactions\
  \ with Black people, I\u2019ve been met with a wide range of reactions\u2014some\
  \ frankly astonishing. Armed with this awareness, I was prepared for almost anything\
  \ when I embarked on my most recent trip this July. I traveled, mostly on my own,\
  \ for five months\u2014as I write this stateside, I\u2019m still reeling from reverse\
  \ culture shock. I traveled through 20 countries: Greece, Italy, France, Austria,\
  \ Slovakia, Russia, Poland, Scotland, Montenegro, Hungary, Malta, Portugal, Spain,\
  \ Israel and the Palestinian Territories, Jordan, Hong Kong, Taiwan, Singapore,\
  \ the Netherlands, and Belgium. The successful completion of this trip upped the\
  \ number of countries I\u2019ve visited to 44, the majority being solo trips. \n\
  \  \nThis summer, some potential locations gave me pause, particularly Russia. Beyond\
  \ the usual misgivings many Americans have about visiting our once and ever foe,\
  \ I was especially intimidated by incidents of anti-Black violence against both\
  \ tourists and its vanishingly tiny resident Black population. I worried about whether\
  \ its nationalistic political landscape and the tense relations between our countries\
  \ might translate into hostility towards me. I scoured the internet for travelogues\
  \ or testimonies written by Black Americans who\u2019d been to Russia, finding just\
  \ two. I went back and forth on its inclusion on my itinerary a million times\u2014\
  looking for reasons to stall the grueling, expensive process of obtaining a Russian\
  \ visa.\n\nI was afraid of everything\u2014of being robbed by street thugs, of being\
  \ robbed by the police, of being robbed by taxi drivers. One travel guide warned\
  \ of sharp icicles falling off balustrades and impaling pedestrians. Ultimately,\
  \ each time I wanted to back out, a quick Google image search or YouTube video tour\
  \ pulled my heartstrings in the direction of \u201Cyes\u201D\u2014in spite of the\
  \ specter of the Cold War lurking just beneath the surface, Russia appeared like\
  \ a dream I felt compelled to realize. As a reward for eventually insisting on an\
  \ open mind, my experience in St. Petersburg was indeed magical. I came to regret\
  \ that I\u2019d prejudged Russia the same way I resist and resent it happening to\
  \ me. Mark Twain said, \u201CTravel is fatal to prejudice, bigotry, and narrow-mindedness.\u201D\
  \ This proved true.  \n\nDoes this maxim also work in the reverse: Can travelers\
  \ themselves deal a fatal blow to stereotypes held by people in the host countries\
  \ they visit? I have grown to love visiting countries where they receive very few\
  \ Black tourists\u2014where many people haven\u2019t formed preconceived notions\
  \ about who we are. In these ripe, rare spaces, there exist no preconceptions or\
  \ schemas until I set them\u2014and I like to surprise. I like to think that my\
  \ presence makes an impact in a world rife with anti-Blackness, and that I engage\
  \ with locals in ways that promote mutual cultural understanding. Even when I stand\
  \ apart, I search for connections and commonalities. I do what I\u2019ve always\
  \ done\u2014survive amidst cultural chaos. The floundering Black girl forced to\
  \ reinvent herself in dozens of different climates and cultures now does so assuredly,\
  \ hoping to position herself\u2014a good citizen of a global community."
