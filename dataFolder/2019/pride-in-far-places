Text: "There is something uniquely disorienting about being abroad while your country\
  \ experiences a national tragedy. In the summer of 2016, while my fellow Americans\
  \ witnessed a deadly hostage situation play out, I was enjoying my first European\
  \ excursion.\n\nOn June 12, I was in Genoa, Italy. That day in particular, I was\
  \ surrounded by centuries-old Gothic architecture in the Cattedrale di San Lorenzo,\
  \ admiring the elaborate Byzantine frescoes and contemplating divinity in ways I\
  \ never had before. \n\nAn ocean away, my family and friends were watching news\
  \ of the Pulse nightclub shooting in Orlando, Florida. At the time, having resulted\
  \ in the deaths of nearly 50 people, it was the deadliest mass shooting in US history.\n\
  \nSocial media informed me first. Moments before, I was bursting with admiration\
  \ for mankind\u2019s ability to create something as beautifully enduring as the\
  \ frescoes. But by the time I finished scrolling through countless articles about\
  \ the massacre, I could hardly feel anything at all. The weight of the tragedy pressed\
  \ down on me in ways I couldn\u2019t define. I stayed inside that evening.\n\nThe\
  \ next day, I walked among Italian strangers who seemed to carry on as usual. A\
  \ society that, having publicly expressed its condolences, had its own news to report.\
  \ Among my European friends, bemused by America\u2019s relationship to firearms,\
  \ expressions of sympathy were immediately followed by questions about gun laws.\
  \ But something important felt\u2026unsaid. \n\nI struggled to internalize this\
  \ tragedy from 5,000 miles away. Calls home made me feel conspicuously absent from\
  \ the event. Who was I to express fear and distress from the safety of my little\
  \ Italian getaway? I felt like I was holding my breath. \n \nUntil I got to work.\n\
  \nMy job always began with some espresso and a friendly chat with my coworkers.\
  \ My boss Luigi had an energetic presence and a bright, booming voice that suited\
  \ easy smiles. But that day none of the usual joy was present as he expressed his\
  \ dissatisfaction with the Italian response to Pulse. \u201CThis is crazy!\u201D\
  \ \n\nI prepared myself for more talk of gun legislation and terrorism, but then\
  \ he said the one thing I didn\u2019t know I had been waiting to hear: \u201CHardly\
  \ anyone is talking about the gay victims. This is very terrible.\u201D\n\nAnd suddenly\
  \ I could breathe again. Up until then, I had been spoken to as an American whose\
  \ country had undergone yet another shooting. But I had been suffering as a recently\
  \ un-closeted member of a community that had just suffered its deadliest act of\
  \ violence in US history. Young people like me had gone to a place that promised\
  \ love and acceptance and were met with hatred and bullets. \u201CYes,\u201D I sighed.\
  \ \u201CIt\u2019s so terrible.\u201D\n\n\u201CWe should all go to the Pride parade!\u201D\
  \n\nI almost choked on my espresso.\n\nGenoa is a predominantly Catholic city in\
  \ the northern region of Liguria. While I knew that I would be there during Pride\
  \ season, it didn\u2019t occur to me to pack my colorful clothes and LGBT+ buttons.\
  \ I thought of my community as something that existed in a geographic location:\
  \ my home. But as Luigi championed the need to show solidarity with the gay victims,\
  \ I was stunned with a rather obvious realization:\n\nMy community is here too?\n\
  \nHe turned to me. \u201CWe have to go, yes?\u201D\n\nYes.\n\nSo we went. \n\nJust\
  \ days later, we stood amidst a crowd of hundreds on Via XX Settembre. Besides the\
  \ multitudes of colorful Hawaiian-style leis, most people were dressed in the casual\
  \ streetwear I saw every day. The Pride procession marched up the main street, gathering\
  \ people as they stepped out of shops and restaurants, and carrying them forward\
  \ like a slow-moving train. Elderly couples held hands. Children were hoisted up\
  \ on parents\u2019 shoulders. A couple danced with the Brazilian flag. \n\nRainbow\
  \ flags flashed vibrantly against the pale stone of the surrounding buildings. The\
  \ crowd flowed forward, bobbing along to an Italian remix of \u201CRhythm of the\
  \ Night.\u201D For the first time since arriving in Italy, I felt at home. Safe\
  \ and synchronized among my people. As if every head held high, crowned with rainbow\
  \ wreaths, was proclaiming a single response to the tragedy:\n\nWe\u2019re still\
  \ here."
