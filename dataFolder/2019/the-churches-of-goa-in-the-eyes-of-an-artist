Text: "There's an urban legend among the youth of India, that if you plan a trip to\
  \ Goa, for more than a day, it won't materialize. I will say literally, everyone,\
  \ in the college days planned a trip to Goa with friends. Owing to the accessibility\
  \ and a perceived leisure of the beaches of Goa. \n\nI, with three of my friends\
  \ from college, went to Goa in 2017, to gather a case study of a naval aviation\
  \ museum, as a college assignment. After getting the job done in Vasco De Gama,\
  \ we went to see the sights in panjim. Three churches, these I will remember for\
  \ the rest of my life. \n\nOur Lady of the Immaculate Conception Church, near the\
  \ municipal gardens, two symmetric zig-zag stair ways lead up a small hill, upon\
  \ which the chapel sits, overlooking a good part of the city. The church itself\
  \ is quite an unassuming structure, impressive for a 400 year old building and with\
  \ fair baroque influence, but relevant only to a believer. The church conducts mass\
  \ every day and one might experience a Christian's faith. The simplicity of the\
  \ complex, however uncharacteristic for a baroque church, leaves an impression.\n\
  \nCathedral of st. Catherine, or the s\xE9 cathedral, about 10 kms from the last\
  \ site, is a truely grand cathedral located upon a small mound. All the features\
  \ of Romanesque-baroque architecture are prominent in the church. The entrance is\
  \ an amazing gothich portal flanked by a couple of beautiful, albeit ornamental\
  \ Corinthian collumns in tuscan sandstone. The ceiling is held up by a row of vicinal\
  \ ribbed vaults. The best time and place to observe the church though is nearing\
  \ sunset, from the East gate at about a 50 meter distance. This was the highlight\
  \ of the trip for me. \n\nAs an architect though, the basilica of bom Jesus, 500\
  \ meters form the s\xE9 cathedral across a road, was my most significant find in\
  \ Goa. A UNESCO heritage site, the basilica hold the remains of the much loved st.\
  \ Francis Xavier. The structure, built in brick and mortar and sand stone, is a\
  \ true example of gothic architecture practiced by the Portuguese, in the 16th century.\
  \ While most churches in old Goa date to the 16th or very early 17th century, and\
  \ are fairly similar in style and structure, the basillca stands out. The most salient\
  \ feature are the butresses supporting the roof vaults. A most brutal fascade also\
  \ affiliates the church to the baroque style, along with the structural and design\
  \ features such as ornamental arches and portals. However, architecture is incomplete\
  \ if it does not invoke emotion and stir the sole. I heard in my head \"Ave Maria\"\
  \ as I entered and walked through the aisle. I admit the mortal remains were a bit\
  \ nerving to a kid from a pyre burning Hindu household, but I must also admit, I\
  \ could not help but feel reverence and hope in that place. An embracing warmth,\
  \ a mild sense of belonging, I am grateful for the incidence of this architecture\
  \ but am left to wonder if I must be grateful to the faith that enabled such a feat.\
  \ Faith not of religion but born of human perturbation and of hope."
