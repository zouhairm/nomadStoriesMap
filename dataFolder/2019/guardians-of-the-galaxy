Text: "\u201CHave you seen the new Guardians of the Galaxy movie?\u201D my guide asks.\n\
  \        I answer that I have, and that I\u2019ve been listening to the soundtrack\
  \ obsessively ever since. \n\tI take a sip of coffee and my guide takes a sip of\
  \ lassi. We are sitting on the rooftop of a restaurant that looks out at Boudhanath\
  \ Stupa, the biggest stupa in the world. My guide has been explaining to me that\
  \ stupas are Buddhist shrines that enclose relics, clothes from buddhas or bodhisattvas,\
  \ lotuses, or other significant objects. The stupas in Kathmandu have domed tops,\
  \ like half-moons, or like your head. He says the top of your head is like a stupa\
  \ and your brain is the treasure inside.\n\tThe giant white dome in front of us\
  \ is being repainted with gold paint. The repainting process appears to consist\
  \ of people throwing paint into semi circles around the dome, so the gold takes\
  \ on the shape of flower petals, allowing the white of the dome to peak through.\
  \ The stupa is repainted daily. \n\tOn top of the dome is a rectangular gold face\
  \ with thirteen gold steps above it, representing the thirteen steps it takes to\
  \ reach enlightenment. Above the steps is an ornate gold peak with what looks like\
  \ a crown on it and prayer flags fluttering out in all directions. The prayer flags\
  \ scatter good thoughts to the wind, and while I drink my coffee and makes plans\
  \ for the day I feel a private happiness that the flags and the gold of the stupa\
  \ are reflected in the  small black circles of my pupils that have traveled eight\
  \ thousand miles to be here. \n\tMy guide is telling me more about his favorite\
  \ movies, he says sometimes all he does for days on end is watch movies and drink\
  \ tea. I laugh and tell him that sometimes I do the same thing in New York. I tell\
  \ him how my family didn\u2019t watch a lot of movies growing up so when I was college\
  \ I started watching whatever was recommended to me as a way to catch up, and have\
  \ been a movie lover and enthusiast ever since. \n\tHe tells me he didn\u2019t grow\
  \ up watching movies either, and that he actually didn\u2019t see his first movie\
  \ until he was eighteen.\n\t\u201CHow is that possible?\u201D I ask. And also, \u201C\
  What was that like? I can\u2019t even imagine that.\u201D\n\tHe says it was amazing,\
  \ truly amazing, and that once he started watching movies he couldn\u2019t stop.\
  \ He grew up in a small village in the Himalayas and no one in his town had a television.\
  \ His family had a radio that would play the same programming throughout the day\
  \ in different languages. Listening the repeated programming is what helped him\
  \ learn English, he says as an aside. \n\tHe tells me he started carrying packs\
  \ for trekkers in the Himalayas, and once he learned the trails he became a guide.\
  \ When he saved up enough money as a guide he moved to Kathmandu, and in Kathmandu\
  \ he got a camera and a laptop and guitar. It\u2019s July, monsoon season, so he\u2019\
  s doing tours of the city and taking pictures for a newspaper and practicing the\
  \ guitar until he starts guiding treks again in the fall. \n\t\u201CHow old are\
  \ you?\u201D I ask.\n\t\u201CTwenty-eight. How old are you?\u201D\n\t\u201CTwenty-six.\u201D\
  \n\tWe watch the scarlet robed monks do walking prayers around the stupa, turning\
  \ prayer wheels and chanting om mani padme om as they go. He tells me that it is\
  \ unlucky to do an even number of walking prayers, if you do two you have to do\
  \ three, if you do four you have to do five, if you do six you have to do seven.\
  \ He tells me Buddha\u2019s fingernail might be inside Boudhanath stupa, but also\
  \ that it might not be. He tells me that it\u2019s a beautiful day, but that it\
  \ will rain later. He tells me that when the rain stops it will be beautiful again.\
  \ \n\t\u201CDo you want to listen to the Guardians of the Galaxy soundtrack?\u201D\
  \ I ask.\n\t\u201CYes, but just one song. Maybe just \u2018Brandy.\u2019 We have\
  \ a lot to see.\u201D"
