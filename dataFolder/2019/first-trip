Text: "Happily, that is what i felt when arriving at Seoul, South Korea. My hearts\
  \ is beating madly and i still fell this is all a dream. The country i dream about\
  \ now became the first country i visit outside my my country.\nI traveled to soul\
  \ in August at the end of summer with my friend to watch the concerts and exhibitions.\
  \ Extream weather and typhoon are happening almost every day. Our plan to visit\
  \ the beach in gangneung eventually fail due to the extremely dangerous. So we changed\
  \ plans just visiting the area in seoul.\nWe stayed in a guesthouse in Myeongdong\
  \ with room for five persons. The guesthouse is close to namsan tower and shopping\
  \ area in Myeongdong. On the top floor of the guesthouse we can see the Namsan Tower.\
  \ Our roommate is a girl from Russia, she is nice girl .\nI'm not really fluent\
  \ in english, so is a little bit difficult to chating with her. But with the help\
  \ of sign language we could mutually understand each other.  \nThe next say me with\
  \ my friend get around Seoul by using public transportation such as subway and bus.\
  \ Sometimes we also walk like a native.\nWe tried some of the food like tteobokki,\
  \ odeng, kimbab, ramen and many more. It feels quite suitable and tasty for me.\
  \ \nAfter tasting food we also visit Gyeongbok Palace by wearing a hanbok (Korean\
  \ traditional clothes). They have an interesting culture, although in the middle\
  \ of modern culture they still retain their original culture.\nNear Gyeongbok Palace\
  \ there is the Bukchon Hanok Village. Formerly a noble residence and officials,\
  \ an now as the traditional Korean cultural center. While walking in the bukchon\
  \ village we felt like a return to the days of the Joseon dynasty. The House was\
  \ also still well kept.\nMy trip was fun, thought a lot of things happen that aren't\
  \ planned. Travel to the countries that to not use english as their primary language\
  \ is indeed a little bit hard. Many interesting events happened because of the languange\
  \ diffeences. Like food traders are upsef because we use english and she didn't\
  \ understand. Ask the locals but they don't understand what we mean, got the wrong\
  \ bus stop. Even got lost because we not able to read direction, because it is written\
  \ using hangul.\nAt first i was little affraid to go without my family or tour guide,\
  \ because this my first time to another country and i only go with my friends. I\
  \ got the fear, about language, culture, food and also the sophistication of the\
  \ technology. But after having lived thought it, all is fine. Althought there are\
  \ some small barriers but it is the art of travel. We just have to try it without\
  \ hesitation."
