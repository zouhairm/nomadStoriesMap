Text: I WAS happy and overjoyed going out of my country thinking the journey would
  be easy as ive been told the focus is were going to ITALY but we,ll pass through
  libya to reach italy we board a bus and it took us to niger boarder after that we
  were taken to the outskirts of libya within three days then we began to esperience
  the unknown first we were packed like sardines inside a pick up a van i felt pain
  all over my body the van took us through wilderness because they the drivers didnt
  want to pay money so it was a galloping road as we were going our driver went through
  a major road suddenly we were been chased by some soldiers the driver drove carelessly.
  And re enter the wilderness again and the soldier couldnt see us we went through
  thick forest wilderness suddenly our van broke down and we came down im happy because
  im feeling pains all through we were there for 3 days without waters our driver
  went for water and how to fix the broken. Van 1 person gave up we were everywhere
  searching for water in the wilderness we almost got lost ill not finish my story
