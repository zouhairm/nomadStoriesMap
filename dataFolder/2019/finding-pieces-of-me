Text: "Travelling to a foreign country is always exciting. But travelling to a place\
  \ that you already know and love with a close group of friends from all over the\
  \ world, exciting is just a small part of all the feelings and emotions you get\
  \ to experience. \nWe often find ourselves learning new things on a daily basis\
  \ but not often you get to meet new parts of yourself nonstop. \nTravelling with\
  \ friends in a foreign, tropical country (that none of us are used to) it\u2019\
  s quite an experience. Not only do you laugh constantly at the obvious differences\
  \ of the cultures ( words that have different meanings for everyone, horrible driving\
  \ with the rule of never honking because it\u2019s \u201Crude\u201D, etc.) you start\
  \ being more aware of  things you are comfortable with or happy with, and at the\
  \ same time what you\u2019re not willing to tolerate or how to behave in situations\
  \ that you\u2019ve never faced before. \nAll you\u2019re loved ones you have things\
  \ in common with, that is why you are together and chose to spend a beautiful quality\
  \ (and expensive) time together. But when you are faced with different options,\
  \ attitudes, mindsets and expectations you gotta prioritise. Friendship, trip, experience,\
  \ love, connection and many more start playing a key role in your trip.\nSo how\
  \ do you manage everything at once? Well my secret is to understand and embrace\
  \ the fact that in each and every single one of my friends and situations I am going\
  \ to learn more about myself. \nIn disagreements regarding for example what beach\
  \ to go to (some want to surf whilst others just chill and sunbathe) I get to pick\
  \ and see what\u2019s more important to me. In this case in particular I chose not\
  \ to disagree with anyone but instead go along with the surf plan (al though I do\
  \ not surf) and watch how I behave myself in a not ideal situation knowing i\u2019\
  m spending time and money I\u2019ll never get back. Guess what... it was fabulous\
  \ I decided to get into my friends passion and start new conversations about their\
  \ surfing experiences, what beaches or countries they go to, the differences, the\
  \ most important factors (waves, weather etc). Learned a lot and stabilised more\
  \ deep connections with them and also new friends that came along. I left that day\
  \ not having wasted time or money but having made new friends, learned about the\
  \ best surf spots and shops in the area (useful for my other surfing buddies that\
  \ didn\u2019t come on this trip) and just having more insight on the mindsent of\
  \ the fascinating sport that includes being aware of the environment and well being.\
  \ \n\nProud to say a little piece of Costa Rica and it\u2019s ticos (slang for costa\
  \ ricans) are part of my heart and soul now. I have been getting involved in opportunities\
  \ to create more awareness about the environment and easy changes that cabe be made\
  \ at home and with friends to spread the word. \n\nMuch love Costa Rica. PURA VIDA."
