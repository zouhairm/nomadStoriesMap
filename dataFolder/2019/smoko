Text: "I\u2019m screaming on the inside. \n\u201CUNO MAS!\u201D\n\u201CSi.\u2019\n\
  No matter how hard I try, I can\u2019t shake the whimper of defeat from my voice.\
  \ The sun has fashioned my pale skin red, my shirt is saturated with sweat specked\
  \ with dirt and my breath is coming out hot and fast. I arch my back to pick up\
  \ another jagged piece of red brick held together with clay, knowing full well I\
  \ am doing more damage to my already beaten body. I can swear the Alpaca that had\
  \ been grazing nearby is now staring at me dead in the eye, shaking its head at\
  \ the pudgy, sweaty, red Westerner standing before it. \nLike a homing pidgeon,\
  \ I cling onto the music playing faintly through my earphones, reminding me that\
  \ less than four weeks ago, I was on the opposite side of the world. I let my mind\
  \ drift back to a time before my nails had been chipped all the way through to the\
  \ cuticle, or I had been ridden with a nasty blood-borne bacterium called amoeba,\
  \ which according to the travel doctor would wreak havoc on my gut for many months\
  \ to come.\nJust remember why you are here. \n\nWe\u2019re building a school for\
  \ kids living in the remote village of Cusco\u2019s mountainous regions, Quilla\
  \ Huata. In regions where there are no schools, children as young as four help their\
  \ parents work hard labour. Six to seven hours a day with an hour break in between,\
  \ we work as a team of sixteen volunteers under the guidance of long-time volunteers\
  \ from the community. The voice we heard earlier, demanding \u2018UNO MAS!\u2019\
  \ is Artur, who is the leader of the construction. Short and astute in appearance,\
  \ he speaks very few words with us when he is not barking orders. He shows his appreciation\
  \ by giving us a thumbs up after each day is complete. His English is poor, so we\
  \ greet him by waving our hands and making do with the little Spanish we have learnt.\n\
  \nQuilla Huata is at least an hour out from Cusco city\u2019s outskirts. The locals\
  \ here are all poor and live in huts that are no bigger than the size of a modern-day\
  \ bathroom. Only yesterday we visited a family of five, a mother and her four girls,\
  \ living in a hut made of straw and wood. There is no power, no water, no shower,\
  \ no beds. In Spanish translated by our team leader, the mother tells us how she\
  \ can\u2019t wait for her eldest child to turn sixteen so she could maybe get married\
  \ and leave the nest. I wept the whole drive back to our sprawling, furnished volunteer\
  \ house hidden in the gated community of Cusco\u2019s wealthier neighbourhoods.\
  \ That same night we all head out to Cusco city and the stark contrast of the city\u2019\
  s socioeconomic condition screams out to me louder than ever.\n\u2018Over there\
  \ is the Plaza De Armas, a popular tourist attraction that sees thousands of\u2026\
  \u2019\nI stop hearing the words of our tour guide and instead hear the cries of\
  \ a child in her mother\u2019s arms, huddled under the closest shelter they can\
  \ find. I think of the kids in their huts and I wonder if they are cold. The temperature\
  \ dropped below 0 degrees in the mountains.\n\nBack at the site where I am red from\
  \ the sun but nowhere near as burnt as the kids, my arms begin to quake and I drop\
  \ the brick. Artur motions for me to follow him. Unsure of whether I am in trouble,\
  \ I drag my heavy legs and follow him to the back of the building where the supplies\
  \ are held. He reaches into his pocket and pulls out a crumpled packet of cigarettes.\n\
  \u2018Smoko?\u2019\nDid I hear right?\n\u2018Smoko?\u2019 I laughed. \n\u2018Si\
  \ chica, smoko.\u2019\nSmoko, a colloquial term used in Australia to describe a\
  \ smoke break, uttered by Artur who could barely say \u201CThank you\u201D, is the\
  \ trail left behind by someone before me who had tried that little bit harder to\
  \ connect.\nI feel my smile grow as big his and even though I don\u2019t smoke,\
  \ I reach out my hand and accept the cigarette."
