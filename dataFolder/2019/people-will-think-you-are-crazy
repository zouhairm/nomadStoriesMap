Text: "Arriving in a unkown place is always a process of letting your heart and mind\
  \ open for anything. You don't know what you'll find. You don't know how people\
  \ react to casual things and most of the times is very different of how you react.\n\
  When I first arrived in Toronto I looked around and I could see a lot of different\
  \ people. Super white and blond, black people, japanese, korean, arabic, looked\
  \ like a kind of Noe's boat. It's beautiful to see those cultures getting along\
  \ and how the enviroment was always chill and respectful.\nAs I walked around I\
  \ could see a lot of similar things to my hometown, like some buildings, some things\
  \ about the subway and the buses, some things about the food and how people behave.\n\
  But at the same time I could see how unfair somethings are for countries that are\
  \ not part of \"the first world\". When I talked about domestic violence, for exemple,\
  \ people were scared because there nothing like that happens. Usual things from\
  \ where I am from that are very, very sad, they never even heard about, or if they\
  \ did, it was only once or twice in their life time.\nI started to feel bad and\
  \ guilty because I was in a place where things worked so perfectly, and when I thought\
  \ about people in my country, I felt bad because its unfair that here we have to\
  \ work a thousand times harder to get the bare minimum.\nBut of course it didn't\
  \ stop me from seeing the beauty, the amazing culture. In fact I learned a lot and\
  \ I could understand what in Canada's history made it possible to be like that.\n\
  I fell in love with the nature, the weather, the snow, the big city without 24 million\
  \ citizens, but only 3 million - or something like that. The space to breathe, the\
  \ horizon, the fact that it didn't matter where you were you could see the sky.\n\
  I started to feel like home. But at home we hug when we meet someone wjen it was\
  \ the biggest cultural difference. \nI went out one night and a guy told me \"if\
  \ you hug people you don't know, they'll think you are crazy\".\nFor a second I\
  \ gor offended, but then I remembered that they are not from a tropical country,\
  \ so I hugged him and I said \"I'm not crazy. Just an ordinary Brazilian. We have\
  \ a nice super-power to bring summer feelings anytime!\"\nSo he hugged me again\
  \ and we found the perfect balance between our cultures. And the best part is that\
  \ I found a different balance with everyone I met. \nThat's the best part of travelling.\
  \ Understanding the others feelings and consider the enviroment they grew up in."
