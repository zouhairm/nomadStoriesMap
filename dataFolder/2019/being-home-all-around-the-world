Text: "So, what does home mean? To this question, most people would probably give\
  \ answers such as: the town where they grew up, the place where their family lives\
  \ or would name a particular person who means home to them. Until this summer, I\
  \ was one of these people, but then a trip to Belgium changed the meaning of this\
  \ concept in my head and I realized, that we can be home all around the Earth, even\
  \ without knowing it.\nMy boyfriend and I went to Belgium at the beginning of September.\
  \ We didn\u2019t have a specific destination in Belgium, that\u2019s why we decided\
  \ to take a trip to Brussels, which was the first city to come up in our minds when\
  \ we were planning the journey. Brussels is similar to Budapest, the capital of\
  \ our homeland, Hungary in many ways, but is also different in so many aspects.\
  \ The huge amount of open and green squares, the groups of large and vivid trees,\
  \ the narrow streets, the ups and downs and its historically beautiful buildings\
  \ distinguished Brussels from any other city I have ever been to. The bustle of\
  \ the local people made the experience even more memorable.\nOne day as we were\
  \ wondering through one of its maze like streets, we saw a poster advertising a\
  \ local festival that was built around Hungary. It was a 2 day event that took place\
  \ in one of the neighboring parks. Of course, we decided to go, I mean what were\
  \ the odds that we would find an event in the middle of another country, revolving\
  \ around Hungarian history and culture?\nThe next day, as we were approaching the\
  \ entrance of the festival, we could smell all the different dishes. It smelt like\
  \ home. We were walking through the tents that were decorated with all the typical\
  \ Hungarian accessories such as whips, furs, saddles and colorful embroidered fabrics.\
  \ The air was full of the miscellany of the scent of stew, paprika and sausage.\
  \ People were enjoying Hungarian wines, and of course, p\xE1linka. There was even\
  \ a folk dance show, which the locals absolutely loved. Hungarian movies were played\
  \ and Hungarian inventions were introduced. To my biggest surprise, the park was\
  \ full of Hungarian people as well. It was so nice to hear others speak Hungarian\
  \ after all the foreign languages. We spent the whole day strolling around, and\
  \ I felt as I was home, because the whole premise felt like home. That\u2019s where\
  \ I realized, that for me, home isn\u2019t just one place, but is a feeling that\
  \ we are in the right place with the people we love."
