Text: "\"Things transform, they don\u2019t perish.\u201D Some one-liners just jump\
  \ out at you and that one sprung at me from the entertainment screen as our flight\
  \ coasted into New Chitose Airport, Hokkaido. What an apt tag line for this trip,\
  \ I thought, likening \u2019things\u2019 to the non-tangible sort, and that thought\
  \ accompanied by the vague notion of the many ironies that phrase might present.\
  \ I was after all, a novice snowboarder about to throw myself down a mountain, and\
  \ transform might assume all manner of applications. One\u2019s limbs, perhaps.\n\
  Having never tried snow boarding before, I had an apprehension that the artist of\
  \ avoidance would become apparent in me, but I surprised myself. On my second day\
  \ on the slopes I could stand up, ride heel side down the mountain, break with some\
  \ semblance of control, and get off the lift without stacking it, occasionally.\
  \ I inadvertently found myself riding toe side once or twice but I picked up speed\
  \ and didn't have break control and that\u2019s a recipe for a swift faceplant,\
  \ I tell you. In any case, I\u2019m going from a higher elevation to a lower one,\
  \ and although the powder is forgiving, it\u2019s hard when I come down.\nAs adults\
  \ it doesn\u2019t feel natural for us to fall. It is an embarrassment, a tendency\
  \ of infancy that we feel that we should conquer as young children. As we grow up,\
  \ most of us become innately more self-preserving and less willing to expose ourselves\
  \ to opportunities to fall, or to fail. This is especially keen in women, who harbour\
  \ a genetic predisposition to protect in order to procreate. We think that falling\
  \ implies a lack of intention and control, which we are wired to believe is necessary\
  \ for a successful and dignified life. On the contrary, falling itself is indeed\
  \ necessary, so necessary for our continued evolution. \nI came to realise that\
  \ it is more of a mental than a physical thing. You have to be so willing to fall,\
  \ and fall hard, to throw yourself in. It\u2019s scary because the stakes are pretty\
  \ high. I spent many runs holding my breath pretty much the whole way down because\
  \ I was bracing myself for a hard fall. After some time I realised that all falls\
  \ were hard, of sorts, and little by little I started to breathe easier, to pull\
  \ the air deep into my lungs, and to fall with abandon. I laughed with lunacy at\
  \ the shock of it. When I fell I saw what all the powdery white looked like from\
  \ the inside. I\u2019d find my limbs in a chasm of forgiving crystals, conduct a\
  \ routine check that everything was in order, and hoist myself up again. Sometimes\
  \ I\u2019d get off the lift and sit at the top of the run and contemplate the descent\
  \ for ages. Finishing a green run without falling filled me with a humble sense\
  \ of accomplishment. Every graceless fall gave me the opportunity to see where I\u2019\
  d come from, if at a rather odd angle. \nIt is a very physical and geographical\
  \ goal when you\u2019re on a piste. In any place you find yourself you must think\
  \ about your orientation in the land, how you got there and where you will go next.\
  \ Where will I make a path from this point? What is my direction? Often I found\
  \ myself adrift in a great sea of white, and thought how much that was common to\
  \ my normal life, where the sea is a milieu of opportunities and things to strive\
  \ for that we construct in our western world.\nSo I persisted, and when I felt that\
  \ my body was exhausted, I took refuge in a cafe and thawed out, let it marinate\
  \ a little. The small gifts that arose in every run gave me another set of tools\
  \ to use, which became clear in times of stillness. And I thrust back out into the\
  \ unknown that was slowly becoming the know, and tried again. \nFalling is about\
  \ vulnerability, and that's the wisdom that I found on my sojourn in the snow. In\
  \ vulnerability I found courage, and I found a self that I'd never known before.\
  \ The greatest gift of all."
