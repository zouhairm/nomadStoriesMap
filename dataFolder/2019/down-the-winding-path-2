Text: "The Swiss Alps, the Greek Islands, the Italian coast, the German beer.  That\u2019\
  s pretty much that sums up Europe in most stories, articles and movies.\nIn  2016,\
  \ my sister and I ventured forth into exploring the cobbled streets, the little\
  \ cafes, the squares (Grand Place) , and most importantly, the hostels nestled in\
  \ the small towns and big, within Europe. We  went backpacking across multiple countries\
  \ but Portugal has my fondest memories. \nIt was the first time when I truly felt\
  \ like a complete foreigner as I knew nothing about the country - neither the language,\
  \ nor the people or the customs. When in France, I was able to communicate in the\
  \ local tongue which put me at ease at once. But out here, everything was strange,\
  \ new, and simply put, different. \n\nLooking out the window of our Ryanair flight,\
  \ the view took my breath away. The crystal waters shimmered in the morning sun\
  \ and  the lush green overwhelmed the entire city while the architecture provided\
  \ a respite from the usual gothic structures. Suddenly I wanted to be there and\
  \ everywhere - right near that fountain, right on the beach, right on those streets.\
  \ A jolt of excitement ran through as I couldn\u2019t wait to get out of my seat.\
  \ \n\nWe waded our way through the crowds at Porto airport towards the local metro\
  \ and made for the Pilot Hostel. Upon reaching, we were as lost as one can be when\
  \ in a new country. We came across an elderly gentleman who pointed us towards the\
  \ hostel and much to our surprise spoke both English and French. \u201CI do it to\
  \ help people,\u201D he casually commented on his multilingual skills. \n\nAs we\
  \ reached the hostel, the first thing I noticed was a wall that read \u2018Pilot\
  \ Your Life\u2019, as I delved into philosophy; musing over how relatable and relevant\
  \ the phrase was. After checking in, we heated some couscous, my new favorite food\
  \ after falafel, and set about exploring the city. On that glorious night, maybe\
  \ the stars aligned perfectly or maybe it was sheer luck but we chanced upon this\
  \ quaint little pub called Tapabento, just off the Rua da Madeira metro station\
  \ where I tasted my first Sangria.  The next two days at Porto went by in a flash\
  \ as we visited the Livraria Lello, and toured the city in an open roof bus, boarding\
  \ and alighting at every stretch of coast we came across. \n\nNext stop was Lisbon,\
  \ for which we had booked the bus service Renex.  Looking out of the bus window,\
  \ I couldn\u2019t help but marvel at the clear evening sky as it changed color from\
  \ shades of orange to palettes of pink to hues of deep blue. All my life, I was\
  \ never one to look at the sky.\n \nUpon reaching Lisbon metro station, we sought\
  \ directions towards our hostel at the Avenida da Liberdade. A map was bought and\
  \ we went round in circles till we passed the little door, rung the bell and entered\
  \ a world not so different from a wonderland. \n \nThe Lisboa Central hostel had\
  \ tours organised for all its residents which led to Alfama and Mouraria every morning.\
  \ I didn\u2019t just learn about the Moorish history and the tsunamis that have\
  \ affected the region, I also discovered Sintra, the Tower of Belem, the origins\
  \ of ginjinha and the first female Fado singer. \n\nAs much as I love doing tourist-y\
  \ things and learning about different cultures and histories, the one night I will\
  \ never forget was one at the hostel. The manager had organized an in-house sangria\
  \ night. We were a group of about 20, all belonging to 10 different nationalities\
  \ sharing  stories and anecdotes from our lives and having a laugh. There wasn\u2019\
  t much on the table that night, both literally and figuratively. However, the powerful\
  \ aura that had filled the room, the warmth and laughter that echoed and the sparkle\
  \ that everyone had was beyond anything I could ever put down in words. \nAnd that\
  \ night changed everything for me. \n\nEver since, I have craved to go back. To\
  \ discover new places, unearth their histories, to meet new people and hear their\
  \ stories. \nAnd, to pilot my life."
