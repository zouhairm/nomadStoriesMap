Text: "Two years ago, I was a girl who had travelled around Europe a tiny bit and\
  \ to the Middle East. I was a girl who couldn't find her place and wanted to get\
  \ out of the confined desk and go, explore all the possibilities. I met one of the\
  \ most important people in my life, randomly at an event. And he said come to me\
  \ for 1 month in Indonesia. I had just met him, so I said I don't really know him\
  \ enough to fly across the world to meet him. But he asked again and again, and\
  \ I said yes. I took my holiday for the entire year and went off to Bali. It was\
  \ my first time in Asia and it was eye opening. It was a whole new world for me,\
  \ as if stepping into another dimension. I fell quickly in love with everything,\
  \ from the flowers to the temples, to the streets, beach, sunsets, people, food.\
  \ I felt at home and each day we went exploring a different side of it I realised\
  \ how much there is in the world to see, to absorb, to enjoy. I I realised how many\
  \ gorgeous and unique sunsets there are for us to remember, how powerful and beautiful\
  \ nature can be, how people can change the way you see the world sometimes. It was\
  \ for me, the beginning of everything, of a new life. I felt like I could do anything,\
  \ the textiles, the people dying the batiks, the colors of the food, the smells,\
  \ the markets, the craziness of it all, it inspired me so much. So I decided to\
  \ quit my job and start doing what I love. This trip, this one small step of saying\
  \ yes to an incredible crazy adventure with this person I barely knew for a couple\
  \ of days, gave me wings to try out this new life. To start building the life I\
  \ know I would love, so I started a new business, I started making kimonos, and\
  \ this made me see who I am, what I want, and put my dreams into my own hands, try\
  \ to make them a reality. \nTaking this trip to Asia for the first time, allowing\
  \ myself to step into the unknown, with my heart open and get over all my fears,\
  \ changed me in such a positive way. It continued also to fuel that thirst of seeing\
  \ more of the world so I went on and traveled more around it, continuously being\
  \ drawn by the strong culture, textures, crafts, and the generally happy way of\
  \ being of people. Even though sometimes maybe the journey didn't seem to make sense,\
  \ it did in the end, it all did. I made mistakes along the way, I cried, I stumbled,\
  \ I fell, but I also learned so much about the world, and about myself and my future.\
  \ I swam with turtles, I saw animals in the wild, I went on in the jungle several\
  \ times, I almost died on Kilimanjaro, I made friends with people from all over\
  \ the world, I learned the rituals, I fell in love with the spices, and then I decided\
  \ to put some more in my life as well.\nIt was one question and one answer. Simple.\
  \ (Yes, I know, it sounds simple, it actually wasn't and my heart was pounding).\
  \ It was one split second that my heart decided to open up, and say yes, to the\
  \ world, to me, to adventures, to buying a return ticket and then just a one way\
  \ ticket. You can look at it as life is just a one way ticket, we all know where\
  \ we end up, so we might as well enjoy every second of that flight, every second\
  \ of that trip, every second of everything, of good and bad. Of eating banh mis\
  \ in the middle of the market at 2AM, of flying across the world and giving a chance\
  \ to a love story, of stumbling upon beauty above the clouds while hiking, of breathing\
  \ in everything. A leap into the unknown changed my life and made me fight for what\
  \ I want. It takes only one step. One word. One yes."
