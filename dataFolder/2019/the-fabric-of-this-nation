Text: "Colors burst through the air like fireworks sprinkling the sky above me with\
  \ the hues of the rainbow. I watch the powder fall all around me, resting on my\
  \ hair and clinging to the back of my hands, my shoulders and on the street surrounding\
  \ me. As I feel the feathery taps of the colored powder melding to my face, I grab\
  \ a handful of more, the powder seeping through the cracks of my fingers as I fling\
  \ it in the air.\n\nThe air is alive with colors as I soak in the majestic beauty\
  \ of it all. Suddenly, I feel a cold burst waking me from my daze. A makeshift paint\
  \ squirter formed out of a plastic water bottle oozes paint all over my arms wielded\
  \ by my friend. My friend laughs as she points the paint squirter away from me and\
  \ towards the rest of the crowd surrounding us. I shriek and duck as I catch another\
  \ person armed with a paint squirter aimed in my direction. \nThe steady beat of\
  \ the steel drum band pounds on as the revelers continue. My attacker chooses another\
  \ victim and I regain my composure and continue moving to the beat of the steel\
  \ drums. The music playing in the background drives the movement and rhythm, not\
  \ only for me but also for the group around me. \n\nThis is Trinidad\u2019s Carnival.\n\
  \nOn the surface, Trinidad\u2019s Carnival holds a reputation of lawlessness and\
  \ hedonism. However, in reality, the truth about Carnival tells a very different\
  \ tale. This is a tale entrenched in a blending of cultures, colonization and the\
  \ history of slavery. \n\nTrinidad, as most may know, was once a colony of the Great\
  \ British empire. However, this is not the beginning nor the end of the island\u2019\
  s history. Trinidad has been wrought over decades of colonization starting with\
  \ the Spaniards, the French and ending with the Brits. The change in \u201Cownership\u201D\
  \ left deep-rooted impressions on the island\u2019s anatomy as each colonizer influenced\
  \ with imparting their perspectives, cultures, and moir\xE9s. \n\nEven today, the\
  \ remnants of colonization are apparent as one walks through the streets of Trinidad.\
  \ With the capital city named \u201CPort of Spain\u201D a testament to the Spaniards,\
  \ the French vernacular used for celebrations or \u201Cfetes\u201D, and the primary\
  \ language of communication imparted by the English, the mix of different European\
  \ cultures bares itself to any onlooker.\n\nFormed not only by European nations,\
  \ a myriad of transplants have been brought over to the island by each ruling party.\
  \ Migrations tend to motivate those transplanted to bring their culture with them\
  \ and share it with their newfound countrymen. Over the years, what was left behind\
  \ is a true blending of cultures derived from the Indian indentured servants, East\
  \ Africans slaves, and native indigenous populations. Trinidadians are like the\
  \ colors of the rainbow, displaying every shade of black, brown, and beige. \n\n\
  This, inherently, is the true meaning of carnival. It is a chance to come together\
  \ across different backgrounds, races, ethnicities, to celebrate as one and join\
  \ in unity. It\u2019s a festival of what makes us human \u2013 the colors, the food,\
  \ the music, and celebrations.  Over the years, Trinidadians have been bound by\
  \ the mere fact that they have been born into the melting pot of different cultural\
  \ ancestries. Their differences have strengthened their resolve to see each other\
  \ as the same and deconstruct the usual barriers dividing cultures and people. \n\
  \nIn current times across the globe, there has been a growing political climate\
  \ fostering division and a \u201Cus versus them\u201D attitude. Many continue to\
  \ propagate the sentiment of nativism within each nation. The cultural unity in\
  \ Trinidad is in stark comparison of this growing sentiment worldwide. Their solidarity\
  \ is a confirmation that communities can meld into a stronger power than what each\
  \ culture represents individually. \n\nCarnival is the glue binding us together\
  \ and encouraging us to dance, enjoy and celebrate together, as one. Colors representing\
  \ the many backgrounds and tapestry of ethnicities stitched together on the fabric\
  \ that is the isle of Trinidad."
