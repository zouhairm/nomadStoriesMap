Text: "It is early morning; I am packing my stuff for a journey to Helmand Laskhargah.\
  \ It is a beautiful and green city, with muddy traditional and stone building houses.\
  \ We\u2019re in the middle of the city, accompanied by two locals, guiding us to\
  \ our hotel. The traditional infrastructure of the hotel in a picture hanged in\
  \ the wall reminds me of this province\u2019s golden age when everyone could visit\
  \ without fear in the 1960s, from my mother\u2019s stories. We enter the room and\
  \ open up the windows, through which we see the heartbreaking devastated city like\
  \ a grieved widow with a black dress.\nThe devastated souls are the victim of radicalization\
  \ and deprived of education in this province even worse than devastated buildings\
  \ because we can rebuild building but stolen childhood can never be mend. Kids are\
  \ either abducted or forced to join Taliban insurgency groups and operate for their\
  \ missions. Remarkably, kids are appointed for the different purpose by radicals\
  \ including suicide killing, destroying schools, planting mines, ambush. Our mission\
  \ today is to visit Taliban child fighters. We\u2019re heading to meet Niaz, a 10-year-old\
  \ kid. Two years ago he was abducted by the Taliban for a special prim and knows\
  \ a lot more about guns than books. He is an orphan too, whose family members including\
  \ father, mother, sister, and brothers were killed by an airstrike of US coalition\
  \ forces, and the insurgences were hiding in their village. He witnesses his parent\u2019\
  s death and retells about his father\u2019s wounds and mother\u2019s last words.\
  \ It is heartbreaking talking to a kid, whose childhood is stolen by the Taliban,\
  \ and left, with hatred and radical ideology.\nWhen he explains how he was trapped\
  \ saying \u201CThey told me to blow up myself, with a heavy magazine size vest bomb\
  \ near the checkpoint, after you blow up we will give you 50 Afghani/60 pence\u201D\
  . He told back, what I will do with money, if I am no more alive and in the grave,\
  \ later he successfully attempts to escapes from Taliban camp, walked until he came\
  \ to a police outpost. Not a word of education, dream, hope, and future from his\
  \ mouth.\nThis makes me to extremely upset to see the future of a kid is stolen\
  \ from him. I am afraid; I\u2019ll forget all, what if my questions are heartbreaking.\
  \ I am trying to be kind enough with this beautiful soul, the victim of conflicts.\
  \ I\u2019m already thinking about what I\u2019ll do what I\u2019ll do for kids-Once\
  \ I\u2019m able to.\nMajority of Kids in the same orphanage lost their families\
  \ in conflicts. He is radicalized against US coalition because he was born after\
  \ the 2001 invasion, saw nothing but war. This grievance is in the hearts and minds\
  \ of this growing generation filled by the Taliban. The fact that NATO is assisting\
  \ the government in the state building process is far from their understanding.\
  \ However from their point of view \u201CThe American just shoot, the national army\
  \ is established for devastation and to fight against their own Taliban citizens\u201D\
  . These basic radical statements by communities are all around this province instead\
  \ of educating their kids about peace and love.\nFor many ways, Helmand\u2019s kids\
  \ suffer from radicalization like many other southern provinces of Afghanistan.\
  \ It is the most dangerous and doesn\u2019t seem like a typical province. Its nine\
  \ million population, two third of them are kids in the age of school. Very little\
  \ development in education to speak about, due to ongoing conflict 600 hundred thousand\
  \ kids is out of school since 2009. A close look at the status of education reveals\
  \ 417 schools are close. Currently, only 49,000 thousand girls and 21,000 boys are\
  \ enrolled in 123 schools. In addition, illegal appointments of teachers, presence\
  \ ghost teachers, and corruption in the administrative level paved the way of even\
  \ grabbing lands allocated for schools. On paper education reports are perfect,\
  \ but in reality, there are no factual monitoring and evaluation reports that can\
  \ present the reality of the education system in this province from 2005-2015. Thus,\
  \ more effort on education by different mean is a better alternative for radicalization."
