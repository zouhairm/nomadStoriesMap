Text: "I have traveled to many places, but it was not until stepping foot in Costa\
  \ Rica did I really understand what the difference a single trip can make in our\
  \ lives. Like many people in the western world, I had my life become about things;\
  \ about being the person that society would prefer me to be, regardless of what\
  \ my inner nature felt, I was still concerned with fulfilling the role I thought\
  \ I had to. It did not matter that I thought I was doing things differently. It\
  \ did not matter if even I was committed to living an authentic life, or even a\
  \ life I love.  \nTo land in Costa Rica was like coming home to a place that I was\
  \ told did not exist. Not because life was perfect, but because there is simplicity\
  \ there that it seems so many of us are searching for in our daily lives. Coming\
  \ into the San Jose airport, I had a taxi waiting to drive me across the mountains\
  \ that border the Carara National Park on the way down to the Manuel Antonio area.\
  \ Immediately, I felt welcomed into a country that was not my own. On the beautiful\
  \ drive down to where I had arranged to stay, I was able to see a flock of Scarlet\
  \ Macaws takes flight over the ocean near Jaco, and the crocodiles near Garabito.\
  \ \nThere was a quiet. A stillness that permeated the country and that seemed to\
  \ overcome my soul as well. \nI had planned to stay at a local inn in Manuel Antonio\
  \ which unfortunately is no longer under the same ownership, but which provided\
  \ me a haven that I did not know I was in need of. While the wildlife was breathtaking,\
  \ from the spider monkeys that tried to steal bananas off our breakfast plates to\
  \ the howler\u2019s that kept us company under the moon, it was simply like I had\
  \ fallen through the earth and somehow landed in utopia. \nBut there is something\
  \ else about Costa Rica and even I would venture to say specifically about the Manuel\
  \ Antonio area and that is this sense of adventure, of home and of a community as\
  \ well. During my time there I did participate in some of the more traditional tourism\
  \ activities like zip lining in the jungle and horseback riding down to a secluded\
  \ waterfall as the radiant Morpho butterfly danced in the air alongside me. Yet\
  \ Costa Rica\u2019s treasures go far beyond any of these activities because it is\
  \ found in its people and in the society, they themselves have built. \nIt is one\
  \ that had me making friends with strangers and attending service and lunch on a\
  \ Sunday at Casa del Pan outside of the resort area. It is an environment whose\
  \ nighttime sounds serenade you into remembering what matters most or maybe even\
  \ waking you up to it for the very first time.  \nIn the quiet moments of Costa\
  \ Rica, the walking along Playa Espadilla, and its beautiful sunsets or buying ceviche\
  \ from the local woman on Playa Biesanz, I felt more at home in my thoughts. When\
  \ we truly submerge ourselves into Costa Rica and her beautiful culture, we also\
  \ allow ourselves to let go of everything that is not truly us. We let go of the\
  \ pressures to be someone or something, to make others happy or even just to, maybe,\
  \ be the people we thought we were. \nAs the week went on, I became more aware of\
  \ how different I felt there, how much more at peace and truly centered in my essence\
  \ I was. But it was also the realization of what I would have to do in order to\
  \ hang onto that as I traveled back into life and all that it entails for the majority\
  \ of us. Yet it did not matter, because once we do find who we are, once we realized\
  \ what matters most to us in life then somehow we are able to always take a piece\
  \ of that with us no matter where we go. \nBecause all it takes is truly just one\
  \ trip sometimes to truly change your life forever."
