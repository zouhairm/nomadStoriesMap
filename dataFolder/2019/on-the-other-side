Text: "Morning dawns. I open my eyes and look around. It was not a dream; I am really\
  \ here. These are not the walls of my room and I'm not in my bed. Everything feels\
  \ confusing inside me for a bit until my mind recovers the lucidity and assimilates\
  \ where I am.\n\nIt\u2019s hard to put down in words all the emotions that have\
  \ invaded me during the first days of my stay in Kerkyra. When you get to a new\
  \ place everything seems strange and somewhat chaotic at first. The streets, the\
  \ language, the traditions ... Suddenly, a range full of possibilities opens up\
  \ before your eyes and, for a few moments, the senses are stunned by so many options.\
  \ \n\nIt\u2019s a magical thing to discover a place for the first time. The first\
  \ time you get lost, the first time you hear a word you did not know, the first\
  \ time you go back home beholding a landscape you had never admired before ... Since\
  \ I've been here, I've experienced countless \"first times\" that stain every new\
  \ day of a peculiar feeling. Every second that goes by. Every place that I discover.\
  \ Every time I go to university choosing a different route from the usual one. Every\
  \ new person that crosses my path. Every time I let my sight get lost in the depths\
  \ of the sea ...\n\nYesterday I started Greek classes. After three weeks of listening\
  \ to a language completely unknown to me, I have finally begun to fully immerse\
  \ myself in its mechanism. In fact, I was looking forward to it. Considering that\
  \ I speak several languages, it is a very frustrating feeling to find yourself in\
  \ a place and not understand a single word of what you hear around you.\n\nI have\
  \ to say that I find Greek a very interesting and complex language at the same time.\
  \ We have already learnt how to read and I'm progressing more than I expected. In\
  \ fact, today I was in a coffee shop with my Latvian friend, Ilze, and we have had\
  \ a lot of fun reading aloud the phrases that were printed in the different sugar\
  \ envelopes. Even the owner of the place, when listening to us, has been correcting\
  \ our pronunciation and explained the meaning of some words. It has been very rewarding.\
  \ Everyone in this island seems to be willing to help.\n\nToday it has not rained.\
  \ So I have been able to go back home bordering the sea as I usually do on sunny\
  \ days. I love staying still for a moment to contemplate the swinging of the waves\
  \ along with the Albanian mountains far away on the other side of the horizon. Occasionally\
  \ a boat passes through the crystal waters and my mind wanders where it will go\
  \ or where it will come from..."
