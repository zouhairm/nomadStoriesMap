Text: "The curtains were yellow, bathing the bedroom in mustard light. The air was\
  \ thick and tasted slightly of claustrophobia. I was sitting at a fold-out table\
  \ in the corner of the room.\n\nAlang dealt another blackjack hand and we ran through\
  \ the procedure, the sign to hit, the sign to hold. I took a swig of my tepid San\
  \ Miguel. What was I doing here, in an upstairs bedroom somewhere in the sepia-tinged\
  \ Poblacion neighbourhood of northern Manila?\n\nI\u2019d met Nicholas and Bella\
  \ that morning in Rizal Park, near the harbour. \u201CYou\u2019re from Cape Town?\u201D\
  \ they asked. \u201CMy sister is moving to Johannesburg to study medicine. We\u2019\
  d love to hear about South Africa. Would you like to have lunch with us in our home?\
  \ We\u2019re just waiting for my uncle.\u201D\n\nGrowing up in South Africa, you\
  \ learn to parse these interactions, to watch your back. Mothers teach their kids:\
  \ Don\u2019t to talk to strangers. Don\u2019t get into cars with strangers. My problem\
  \ is I assume everywhere is safer than back home.\n\nI had no planned itinerary,\
  \ and this felt authentic enough. Don\u2019t trust strangers. Don\u2019t get into\
  \ taxis with strangers. It was all solid advice I ignored.\n\nThe family home was\
  \ a 20km, white-knuckle taxi ride north of Rizal Park, at the entrance to a long\
  \ alleyway flanked by grey, double-storey concrete houses huddled shoulder to shoulder.\
  \ I sat in the living room with Uncle Alang, who turned out to be a croupier at\
  \ a local casino. We ate pork on rice. The beer was still cold. We talked history,\
  \ politics and, finally, money. Alang asked me if I wanted in on a scheme, a way\
  \ we could both con the casino. I blinked. The penny dropped. Curious to see how\
  \ far down the rabbit hole it would roll, I went upstairs, reasoning it would make\
  \ for a good anecdote. Don\u2019t join madcap gambling schemes.\n\nWe practised\
  \ a dozen rounds, Alang teaching me the signals, Bella watching. Alang told me a\
  \ friend was coming by, a Malaysian businessman he knew from the casino. We could\
  \ test our scheme on him. I waved the suggestion off blearily, but five minutes\
  \ later the door opened and in walked a man in an ill-fitting, beige pinstripe suit\
  \ and glasses, a stock photo of a businessman come to life. He sat down at the table.\
  \ My heart boomed. Don\u2019t gamble with creepy strangers.\n\nWe played cards.\
  \ Stock businessman behaved bizarrely, throwing his hands up in mock surprise each\
  \ game I won through clumsy, obvious cheating, pantomiming like an actor in a silent\
  \ movie.\n\nWhen it came to the final round, our guest reached into his satchel\
  \ and withdrew a wad of crisp dollar bills, maybe US$40 000. I felt light-headed.\
  \ The rabbit hole suddenly stretched much deeper. The con was on me. Obviously.\n\
  \n\u201CUh...\u201D I began, as Alang dealt our cards.\n\n\u201CI\u2019ll stand\
  \ you, don\u2019t worry,\u201D he winked.\n\nFour of spades, eight of diamonds.\
  \ Eight of clubs. Fair odds. Raise, call, raise, it all happened through a haze.\
  \ Time to call. Stock businessman dialled up the drama for the cheap seats. \u201C\
  That's the first time you've had three cards. Hmmm!\u201D he crowed, stroking his\
  \ chin. \u201CLet's take another look at these numbers here.\u201D He picked up\
  \ his rough ledger and calculated my potential losses.\n\nIt was too much. This\
  \ was going to end badly. I took a deep breath, then in one motion I stood and stepped\
  \ over Bella towards the door. I expected resistance, but got only shocked expressions.\n\
  \nOut in the street, Alang and I exchanged recriminations, before I jumped in the\
  \ first jeepney that passed, headed anywhere. Don\u2019t fight with strangers.\n\
  \nLater that night, over beers in a bar in Sampaloc, I recounted my experience to\
  \ a group of students. I was lucky to be alive, they said. Last rounds came and\
  \ went, and we shuffled out into the muggy night. I was about to walk off in the\
  \ direction of my hotel before one of them stopped me.\n\n\u201CNo way! I\u2019\
  ll call you a cab. Please, we\u2019ll pay for it,\u201D he protested. \u201CDon\u2019\
  t walk the streets at night.\u201D\n\nGood advice. I hailed a taxi. I\u2019d gambled\
  \ enough that day already."
