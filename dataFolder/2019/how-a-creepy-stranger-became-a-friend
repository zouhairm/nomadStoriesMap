Text: "\"So, how old are you?\" The short dark man with beady eyes and grey moustache\
  \ asked me jovially.\nUnsure and alarmed, I mutter, \"Umm... what's in the age?\
  \ It only keeps on increasing.\"\n\nWe are walking down the road from Jama Masjid,\
  \ in a dimly lit part of old Ahmedabad. It's barely 7:30pm but it's dark and sort\
  \ of empty. While heading to the mosque earlier from Manek Chowk, I had noticed\
  \ people staring at me. Inside the mosque, I had met this particularly friendly\
  \ gentleman who promised to show me the nearby sights. So, that's where we were\
  \ going now, to Sidi Sayid's Mosque, a short walk from Jama Masjid, down a dark\
  \ street up to a congested Bhadra Fort and across the main road.\n\nAnd this is\
  \ where he had asked me about my age only to get a vague philosophical answer. That\
  \ hadn't deterred him. \n\"So are you married?\"\nHe's trying to figure out if anyone\
  \ will miss me if I die, I think to myself.\n\nAs a woman growing up in India, the\
  \ first thing you learn is to stay away from strangers. Especially, male strangers.\
  \ Particularly over-friendly, helpful ones. But my self-appointed guide was having\
  \ none of it.\n \nWhen I muttered that I was, in fact, not married, he proceeded\
  \ to cheerfully talk about how he was 50 years old, had been married for over 20\
  \ years and had a son who was into furniture designing. How his son was engaged\
  \ to be married and he had a small shop in the very market we were now crossing.\
  \ And that his name was... Muhammad Rafi. \n\nMuhammad Rafi was an erstwhile Hindi\
  \ singer who made a name for himself in 1950s and 60s Bollywood flicks. I joked,\
  \ \"So you sing too?\" The guide's beady eyes sparkled with mirth; he roared with\
  \ laughter. I have often found that humour diffuses tension, especially between\
  \ strangers, whatever be their background, sex, religion, social status or political\
  \ belief. Or perhaps, I just like people who laugh at my jokes. \n\nWe were crossing\
  \ the road and our guide diligently held my arm when there was a vehicle speeding\
  \ our way. It was pretty cute, actually. The total concern this stranger had for\
  \ me. The very stranger I was ready to dub a serial killer a few minutes ago. \n\
  \nHe spoke about how he helped other tourists who come to see Jama Masjid, on weekends.\
  \ Finally, we arrived at Sidi Sayid's Mosque. The guard wouldn't let me go inside\
  \ as it was time for the evening namaz but again Muhammad Rafi spin his charm. \"\
  Let it go, brother, she's a guest.\"\n\nAnd that, in essence, defined the true spirit\
  \ of Gujarat. Hospitality, humility, helpfulness. I have been in three metro cities\
  \ and never found the selfless spirit with which people help each other, that I\
  \ did in Gujarat. \n\nSomeday, I will write about Arif, our autodriver in Bhuj,\
  \ who drove his antique autorickshaw at the speed of lightning just so we wouldn't\
  \ miss our bus. Till then, I continue to have a little more faith in people, wherever\
  \ I go. The Muhammad Rafis of the world wouldn't have it any other way."
