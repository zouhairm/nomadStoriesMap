Text: "We met in Dubai on the same cancelled flight so I think this means he\u2019\
  s my soulmate, but on our first morning in Kyoto, at a German-style bakery behind\
  \ the Keifuku Electric Railroad, Leo and I read an article about hostage negotiation\
  \ and this reveals to us our fundamental incompatibility; his acceptance of uncertainty,\
  \ my fear of it. I didn\u2019t come to Japan to be the clich\xE9 of a tourist finding\
  \ her zen self in a temple selfie, but as I eat another pastry it occurs to me how\
  \ much I have to learn about living in the moment. Human beings aren\u2019t wired\
  \ this way, the article says, which makes me feel better. It\u2019s biology, not\
  \ stubbornness, making me constantly anxious about what\u2019s to come.\n\nThe hills\
  \ above Kyoto fade in and out of focus like dreams and we walk skinny streets of\
  \ cherries and willow, blossomless against the now-night sky. What I did not expect\
  \ to find here: Christmas carols playing to the empty street, so many Konditorei.\
  \ We\u2019re looking for an izakaya, but by mistake walk into a restaurant no bigger\
  \ than the tatami room in which we\u2019re staying, and everyone turns to look at\
  \ these gaijin who speak no Japanese, in this place where there's no English menu,\
  \ not even the kind with pictures for the tourists, and they smile and wave us to\
  \ sit. \u201CSo we're staying then,\u201D Leo says, and the chimes of White Christmas\
  \ fade with the closing door.\n\nWe try Google translate, hesitantly: yesterday\
  \ it exchanged \u2018we left our keys in the onsen\u2019 for \u2018we left our pee\
  \ in the ocean\u2019, so we\u2019re not optimistic. \u201CWhat do you love to cook?\u201D\
  \ we ask the chef, with hand gestures, and he points to the counter in front of\
  \ us to mime dipping something into a silver pot. The mime makes it look delicious.\
  \ No double-dipping, he mimes and we nod furiously. He deep-fries one food after\
  \ another, presenting skewered quail eggs, asparagus, something pale and potato-like,\
  \ a sunburst of tiny holes peppering its face, and watches for our reaction as we\
  \ wolf them down. The last of these offerings is unknown to us but the customers\
  \ squeezed into the nearby table laugh and wave their iPhones: lotus root. More\
  \ of that one, we say, drawing circles on our palm, a pattern of concentric dots\
  \ inside. The chef brings out the sak\xE9 and another skewerful.\n\nI\u2019m aware\
  \ of the kitchen radio playing a song I haven't heard in years, Joan Osborne\u2019\
  s \u2018One of Us.\u2019 I loved this at school, but everyone teased me because\
  \ of that line about going back up to heaven all alone. It strikes me that even\
  \ at seventeen I\u2019d wished for some kind of faith, a feeling of certainty in\
  \ an uncertain world. I listen now, eating my fried lotus up in the quiet hills\
  \ above Kyoto, my head warm with sak\xE9, the chef singing along in broken English,\
  \ and wonder if this might be confirmation of something to have faith in after all,\
  \ the beauty of the random, whatever pulled me into this room, on this street, this\
  \ night, six thousand miles from home. I look at the man whose passion for uncertainty\
  \ means he will soon become part of my past, another travel story, a love story\
  \ to tell my grandchildren, and for a minute it strikes me what a simple world it\
  \ is; we all just want to feel alive, to be understood, we all want to be loved,\
  \ for a little bit of ourselves to be imprinted on someone's heart before we die;\
  \ we're all just strangers on the bus trying to figure out which way we\u2019re\
  \ headed, even the ones who love the mystery of travelling without a map. \n\nBeyond\
  \ the window the lights along the Electric Railroad prick through the darkness like\
  \ fallen stars and I remember that haiku of Basho; \n\nEven in Kyoto -\nHearing\
  \ the cuckoo\u2019s cry \u2013\nI long for Kyoto.\n\nI haven\u2019t left yet and\
  \ already I know this is a moment I\u2019m going to long for. But for now, it\u2019\
  s enough to be inside it. Arigatou, I say to the chef, and it\u2019s not just the\
  \ food I\u2019m thanking him for."
