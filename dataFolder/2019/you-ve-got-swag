Text: "It is only when I enter the hostel and my hands start to warm up that I realise\
  \ they froze. It's -18C outside, and my thin gloves show how underprepared I am.\
  \ Not even having noticed the rapid frostbite, they now hurt like hell and I have\
  \ trouble concentrating on my check-in. A painful introduction to winter in Seoul,\
  \ South Korea. A place where I discover it is very hard to hide, from the weather\
  \ but also from the warmth and curiosity of the Koreans, with surprisingly pleasant\
  \ consequences. From the moment I board my flight in Dubai until I leave on Lunar\
  \ New Year's day, I am one of the very few white people kicking around this hot,\
  \ and in summer very hot, new destination. The people are warm, kind and generous.\
  \ I speak to gallery owners about Korean artists, with hostel owners about international\
  \ travel, with random fellow hikers about the best walks, and they all laugh, share\
  \ food or tea, and instant friendships abound. \n\nStanding out whilst travelling\
  \ is not too novel for someone tall and blonde. What I do not expect is for this\
  \ country to give me the biggest culture shock of my life. I spend a few days in\
  \ Gurye, a sleepy town on the edge of the National Park harbouring the highest mainland\
  \ peak, .... I am injured from climbing Mt. Hallasan on Jeju, the actual highest\
  \ part of South Korea. Recuperating, I meet kind locals and spend much time in caf\xE9\
  s. And then I head to Gangnam: the crazy, rich, judgemental, and plastic surgery\
  \ capital of Seoul, if not the world. Where the narrow streets barely squeeze out\
  \ the numerous expensive rides, shaded windows and all. BMWs are the pauper's car\
  \ here. Unlike elsewhere in Seoul, people stare. Giving your face and body a proper\
  \ once, twice, thrice over. Are they assessing what is natural and what isn't? Half\
  \ my hostel is recovering from various forms of surgery. In contrast, I stay there\
  \ for the proximity to my dance school. Running distance. Uphill, downhill, across\
  \ busy roads, past fashion shops. Till I hit the pumping studios of 1Million Dance.\n\
  \nYes, they are an online phenomena. But I am new to this scene. I looked up hiphop\
  \ dance studios in Seoul online - because a visit to Seoul without dancing misses\
  \ out on a cultural essential -, saw a description for this, and rolled with it.\
  \ My first class with Eunho Kim is literally my first hiphop class ever. I am double\
  \ the age of most pupils, a head taller, and the only natural blonde. There is no\
  \ way to hide, even at the back of the class. Luckily I have given up on the hopes\
  \ of doing so a while ago. Keen and stubborn, I know the only way to learn is to\
  \ throw myself in. Which is exactly what I do. And I am instantly hooked. By the\
  \ end of five days, eight classes on, I have thanked the super kind, pumpy and smiley\
  \ Koosung Jung and Yoojung Lee for their energetic classes. Landed a compliment\
  \ from the king of swag himself, Jinwoo Yoon ('you've got swag' he said, when I\
  \ thanked him for his class. Serious shock and surprise). And been heavily checked\
  \ out by the king of cool, Casper (dude, I can't dance. That should have taken you\
  \ five seconds to assess!!) in an advanced class that is blowing my beginner's mind.\
  \ My biggest frustration is not understanding Korean well enough, because of the\
  \ useful, and occasionally hilarious, descriptions all of them are giving to help\
  \ with the moves. Nevertheless, every single class is an amazing experience.\n\n\
  Unbelievably, it is only when I get back home that I discover the youtube video\
  \ phenomena that 1Million is. Honestly, I am relieved I had no idea. Turns out that\
  \ having your bag in some of their videos is quite the claim to fame. But one I\
  \ keep on the down-low whilst practicing my moves on the odd club night, or hidden\
  \ in my room. Until summer, when I went back for more from this warm country and\
  \ its people, got my handbag in another video, and didn't need to wear gloves."
