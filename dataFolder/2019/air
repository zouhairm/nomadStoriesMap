Text: "The year is 2007 and I am only 16. \n\nA school bus, packed with a bunch of\
  \ restless students, is making its way to the capital on a hot summer day. \n\n\
  The teacher, sat next to the driver, is waving an old newspaper in the air, in the\
  \ desperate attempt to generate a cool breeze. But this is Italy, it\u2019s summer,\
  \ and we are all stored inside an old Iveco bus - you just have to accept the outrageous\
  \ 40\xB0 and enjoy the view.\n\nWe\u2019re all singing pop songs in the back seats,\
  \ excited at the idea of being on holiday, but we all suddenly fall silent as we\
  \ enter the Eternal City: we are in complete awe.\n\nFirst up is the Colosseum:\
  \ this one is so famous that, seen in person, it doesn\u2019t even seem real; next,\
  \ as the bus darts across the city, we drive past the Forum: it\u2019s not very\
  \ close but don\u2019t worry, we will visit it tomorrow; look, isn\u2019t that the\
  \ Altar of the Fatherland? What\u2019s next, Trajan\u2019s Column, Trevi Fountain,\
  \ the Pantheon! \n\nWe are now approaching the river, we are on the bridge, opposite\
  \ the impenetrable Castel Sant\u2019Angelo, as majestic as a mausoleum for emperors\
  \ should be.\n\nIt\u2019s a rollercoaster, our heads are spinning for the heat but\
  \ more importantly because of all the magnificence before us: in the scope of half\
  \ an hour we have already seen some of the most famous places in the world without\
  \ even getting off the bus.\n\nOn foot, Rome is even better. If you accept the presence\
  \ of an unspeakable amount of swarming tourists, the city will allow you the experience\
  \ of something special, something unprecedented: the air.\n\nThere are no other\
  \ words to describe it: the air in Rome is different. \nIt\u2019s traveling back\
  \ in time to an ancient dimension where everything is dusty, powerful, charming,\
  \ and yellow. \nYou don\u2019t have to know the history to perceive it but, if you\
  \ do, the feeling is even stronger.\n\nOf the many treasures hidden in the countryside,\
  \ one of the most precious is Villa Adriana: conceived as a retreat for emperor\
  \ Hadrian, this summer residence is surrounded by a beautifully designed maze of\
  \ pools, temples, gardens, islands and baths.\n\nWe are lucky enough to visit at\
  \ a relatively quiet time, and we suddenly fall under a spell. \nStrolling through\
  \ the gardens, climbing on the ruins, walking by the pools, admiring the eternally\
  \ beautiful statues scattered here and there\u2026\nThe place takes us back to a\
  \ time when people spent their whole life trying to achieve perfection.\n\nBack\
  \ to the chaos of the city, it\u2019s clear why Hadrian felt the need to escape\
  \ it.\nAnd yet there is so much to see, we walk and walk, fatigue is banned, hidden\
  \ treasures reveal themselves around every corner, in every square, behind every\
  \ fence.  From time to time, an ice cream provides us with the necessary energies\
  \ to soldier on.\n\nThe final glorious destination, which feels like a reward, is\
  \ a treasure enclosed inside the Vatican\u2019s borders, in the heart of Rome: the\
  \ Sistine Chapel. \nOne of the best examples of Renaissance art, this little chapel\
  \ harbors the works of some of the most famous painters of all time and, above all,\
  \ hosts Michelangelo\u2019s masterpiece The Last Judgement.\n\nAfter spending a\
  \ year on our art schoolbooks, we are finally in front of the famous ceiling; what\
  \ seemed so distant, almost like a myth, is now a few meters away. It\u2019s something\
  \ you can hardly describe with words, it\u2019s peaceful and intimidating at the\
  \ same time. It\u2019s overwhelming. It\u2019s perfect.\n\nI didn\u2019t expect\
  \ to find all this beauty. After all, I was only a teenager. But today, 12 years\
  \ later, I still remember that feeling. I still remember the beauty of the city.\
  \ I still remember Michelangelo. \nI still remember the air."
