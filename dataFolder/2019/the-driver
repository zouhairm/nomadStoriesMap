Text: "As the sun set over the hostel\u2019s rooftop bar, the darkening of the earth\
  \ marked the beginning of a cataclysmic night out.\nStrangers became acquaintances\
  \ as quickly as cups were downed in beer pong. A party bus would escort my boyfriend\
  \ James and I, along with all the other tourists, to Barcelona\u2019s best night\
  \ clubs at 10 PM. Needless to say, pre-loading was on the agenda for the frugal\
  \ traveller, saving a few euros at every opportunity.\n\nHowever, as time neared\
  \ closer to our departure, my mind fell hopelessly into an abyss. A deep void. Fast\
  \ forward to the early hours, approximately 4 AM. I find myself in the unknown.\
  \ In a foreign country, alone, with no clue of how or why I\u2019ve ended up here.\
  \ To my knowledge, I had never even left the hostel. I soon realised that someone,\
  \ some stranger, whom I was naive enough to trust, had spiked my drink. \n\nWhere\
  \ are my belongings? Where is James? Where am I? Looking up, skyscrapers tower over\
  \ me. I feel small, vulnerable, weak. How could I have let this happen? Stupid.\
  \ Stupid. Stupid. Other than feeling extremely hazy, I\u2019m physically in one\
  \ piece. Phew. I struggle onto a bus, heading back to the hostel, hoping to sleep\
  \ off this blurry night. Much to my dismay, this would be my worst decision yet.\
  \ Floating in and out of consciousness, I struggle to regain control of my body\
  \ - the drug overpowering me yet again. With my Spanish skills next to none, the\
  \ driver, who also spoke little English, hands me his phone with words translated:\
  \ \u201CDon\u2019t worry, I will get you back safely.\u201D One by one, each passenger\
  \ departs. \n\nI\u2019m now alone on the bus, swerving higher into the mountainous\
  \ suburbs of Barcelona, with a man I wish I hadn\u2019t entrusted with my safety.\
  \ The bus comes to a halt at the top of the hill. Twinkling street lights dot the\
  \ steep roadside. Informed to hop off and wait for the next bus back to the hostel,\
  \ I listen. Stupid. Stupid. Stupid. \n\nSuddenly, I feel a jolt from behind. A cold,\
  \ unwelcomed embrace. It\u2019s the driver. Shoving me around like a rag doll, he\
  \ forces his protruding lips onto mine. \u201CNO\u201D, I shout, the word deaf to\
  \ his ears. He grasps my wrists and thrusts them towards his belt buckle. \n\nScenarios\
  \ scramble throughout my brain. Fight or flight - Fight? He doesn\u2019t look too\
  \ strong. I could kick him square in the nuts, but what if he attacks back? Then\
  \ I\u2019m fucked. Do I scream? Do I run? Oh God, I\u2019m going to end up in a\
  \ ditch somewhere. I get down on my knees, submissive to his aggressive gestures.\
  \ I tilt my legs toward the roadside, like an athlete waiting for the starting pistol\
  \ in a track race. He releases my hands and begins to undo his trousers. My vulnerability\
  \ escapes me; now is my chance. RUN. Sprinting down the steep hill, tears rush down\
  \ my face. The predatory wolf howls my name. I\u2019ve never felt more afraid, but\
  \ I scamper on, one fleeting foot after another. \n\nAs I reach an apartment block,\
  \ my fingers manically press every single number. I hear a loud buzz, someone has\
  \ let me in. I clamber to the very top of the building. Hysterical, I curl up into\
  \ a ball at a loss of what to do. A few minutes go by and I hear someone coming\
  \ up the stairs. Please don\u2019t be him. Please. A bright light blinds my eyes\
  \ and behind it comes a soft, female voice: \n\n\u201CDon\u2019t worry, I\u2019\
  m a police officer. You\u2019re safe now.\u201D"
