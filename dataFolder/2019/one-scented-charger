Text: "It\u2019s hanging now, on a faded length of crocheted cotton yarn with a collection\
  \ of other jewelry.  A bit less than an inch in diameter, smooth around the sides,\
  \ the coin is a dull bronze, raised letters giving it a pleasant and unique texture.\
  \  \u201CAge coin, LBT, 16+ only,\u201D it says, in varying fonts on both faces.\
  \  This is my storytelling coin, it\u2019s from Amsterdam and I got it in Bangkok.\
  \  \nI was in Thailand for twenty-five days in July 2017.  Twenty-five days in a\
  \ place where most tourists only spend a week.  Fifteen of them I spent in the capital,\
  \ enjoying the pace of the city, paying multiple visits to Loha Prasat and the Golden\
  \ Mountain, resigned to eating Thai instant noodles from the same tiny convenience\
  \ store every day to save money.  For fifteen days I stayed in a green-and-white\
  \ hostel right across from Khao San Road, watching groups of Dutch people go on\
  \ elaborate excursions, come back, and get drunk at night.  It was a languid eternity\
  \ packed into two weeks.  The green-and-white hostel attracted a majority of guests\
  \ from the Netherlands, a phenomenon that baffled even the owner.\nI spent the greater\
  \ part of my days in the hostel, developing a small routine where I would wake up,\
  \ eat something, write, and then go on a long walk in the afternoon.  I came to\
  \ know my hostel owner very well, and some of the other guests, too.  After all,\
  \ that\u2019s the thing to do when you stay in hostels for an extended period. \
  \ In particular, I\u2019ll never forget Robbie.  Yet another Dutch guy, he was on\
  \ summer holiday from Erasmus University, and we shared a room in the four-bed mixed\
  \ dormitory.\nI remember I was sitting up in the room, intensely focused on the\
  \ story I was writing, and Robbie came in.  Startled, I hastily gathered my computer\
  \ cord and stood up to let him through.  \n\u201CAre you staying for a few more\
  \ days?\u201D he asked.\n\u201CUm, yes, that seems to be the case,\u201D I replied,\
  \ putting my computer on my bed.  \n\u201CYou have a nice charger, where did you\
  \ get it?\u201D He pointed to the Fujifilm charger in the extension cord.  \n\u201C\
  Oh, I brought that\u2026I think it came with my camera\u2026do you want to borrow\
  \ it?\u201D I said lamely.  I knew I had an extra, I wasn\u2019t exactly sure where\
  \ I had put it.  \n\u201CWell, I need a nicer charger for the rest of my travels,\
  \ and I don\u2019t want to buy it here.  Will you sell me yours?\u201D\nJust for\
  \ fun, we haggled over the price a bit, then settled on 500 baht.  He reached into\
  \ his wallet and produced a tattered purple banknote, as well as a coin.  \n\u201C\
  This is the coin you get when you go to bars and clubs back in Amsterdam,\u201D\
  \ he said, presenting it to me.  \u201CYou can have this, too, and keep the story\
  \ alive.\u201D\nWe further exchanged a handshake and Facebook profiles.  Then he\
  \ went off to Phuket, and I went back to writing.  \nKeep the story alive.  It was\
  \ such a romantic idea, not at all what I would expect from a Dutch guy studying\
  \ economics.  Then again, I was not expecting to use Thai ointment on a twisted\
  \ ankle, or to find a use for a third phone charger, or to develop a palate for\
  \ beer.  I wasn\u2019t even expecting to stay in Bangkok for so long, much less\
  \ meet so many Dutch people.  Even more, I really didn\u2019t expect to befriend\
  \ any of them in this city, a continent and a world away from Holland.\nI guess\
  \ it\u2019s true then, that the fragrance lingers on the hand of him who gives the\
  \ rose.\nOr in this case, the charger."
