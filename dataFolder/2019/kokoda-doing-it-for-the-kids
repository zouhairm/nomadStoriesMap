Text: "Kokoda\u2026 for starters this is something so far from my usual routine of\
  \ work, drink, sleep, repeat that when I said \u2018YES\u2019 to joining a fellow\
  \ volunteer on a fundraising trek for Make-A-Wish Australia I wasn\u2019t the only\
  \ person who didn\u2019t think I\u2019d actually go through with it.. who knows,\
  \ maybe I was still a little tipsy from Friday Night drinks when I was propositioned\
  \ one Saturday morning at a fundraising BBQ, and, maybe I didn\u2019t quite know\
  \ what I was getting myself into; I mean, I had heard of Kokoda and knew of it\u2019\
  s significance to Australian Military history, but that was about it. \n\nAnyway,\
  \ I had told too many people I was going to do it so there was no backing out now.\
  \ I kicked off my fundraising and started to train\u2026 rain, hail and, a lot of\
  \ the time, with a smidge of a hangover. So April swings around, I\u2019ve spent\
  \ about a thousand dollars getting some vaccinations I likely won\u2019t ever need\
  \ anywhere else in the world, and about $200 at chemist warehouse on mostly shit\
  \ for my feet (totally worth it by the way). Despite the lack of belief in me and\
  \ the relentless taunting from my colleagues that I am likely going to get choppered\
  \ out half way through having failed with requests for photo evidence of me on the\
  \ chopper, I fly out to PNG to meet the bunch of strangers I am about to spend 10\
  \ days with. \n\nWe started North at Kokoda Village and were travelling South to\
  \ finish at Owen\u2019s Corner. Days 1 to 4 got us from Kokoda to Naduri village\
  \ camping at Hoi, Isurava, and Templeton\u2019s Crossing. Despite having been sick\
  \ for the past 3 days, I had, by Day 4, managed to get over the fact that I had\
  \ the runs and felt like shit because, well, our soldiers did it a lot tougher than\
  \ this, and so do the kids that I meet that I was fundraising for.\n\nBrigade Hill\
  \ 25/04/2018 - Definitely one of the most memorable and emotional Anzac days I will\
  \ ever experience. Our Trek Leaders pulled together the most personal and moving\
  \ Dawn Service I will ever have the opportunity to be a part of. Not to mention,\
  \ probably the most remote. Our crew had made each of us a bouquet of flowers that\
  \ they had picked along the track the day before, the villagers from Efogi village\
  \ trekked up in the morning and kicked off the service with some amazing choir singing,\
  \ followed by readings from some of our teammates. \n\nAgulogo Creek to Ofi Creek;\
  \ We\u2019re on the home stretch now; our crew bust out the Backtrack war cry before\
  \ we venture through swampy flatlands, cross the floodplains of the Brown River\
  \ and climb the 9 false peaks of the Maguli Range. We arrive at Nauro Village, one\
  \ of our rest stops for the day; we bought some bananas, sat in the shade and looked\
  \ back in the distance to Brigade Hill while we waited for the rest of our team\
  \ to arrive. At this point we are feeling pretty good about ourselves having tackled\
  \ nine false peaks\u2026 we might have even nicknamed ourselves \u201CTeam 3 Alpha\u201D\
  \ because we had smashed those false peaks and were waiting for the rest of the\
  \ team to catch up. We were soon enlightened by our guide that we hadn\u2019t even\
  \ started them yet. I think a little bit of me died at this point. \n\nDay 9 - Our\
  \ last day on the track\u2026 A bitter sweet morning; our crew sing to us before\
  \ we depart Goodwater for our last few hours on the track. We\u2019re climbing til\
  \ the very end and those last few steps through the arches of Owen\u2019s Corner\
  \ are the hardest and most satisfying steps I\u2019ve ever walked in my life. Part\
  \ of me doesn\u2019t want this to end; the other part of me just wants a shower\
  \ and to take my water logged feet out of these boots and not walk another step\
  \ in them EVER AGAIN!"
