Text: "Line Up\n\u201CBeing an Inch Close to the Train\u201D\n\t\t\t\t\nFor several\
  \ times I set foot on the land of smiles, it was the first time I encountered the\
  \ most congested, the hottest and the most hectic place. Yes, it was supposed to\
  \ be the least expected journey, but I was wrong. \n\nAs soon as the guide told\
  \ us to descend from the car, a heat stroked my head and light breeze blew up my\
  \ strains of hair. I was led to a small road with rows of stores on the left and\
  \ right hand sides showing regular selling and buying activities between vendors\
  \ and customers. Some visitors stopped by to look at what they sold, but I kept\
  \ on walking with others who walked to the same direction to a site beyond my expectation.\
  \ As I approached, more and more people swarmed from different directions preparing\
  \ their cameras to capture the unforgettable moment.\n \nThe next thing I knew,\
  \ I turned to a smaller alley and found that railway road full of vendors and tourists\
  \ lining up for finding the best spot to witness the passing train, the train that\
  \ would normally be avoided, the train that would signal us to go farther. Yet,\
  \ it is longed for and patiently waited. \n\nBunch of small stalls stood side by\
  \ side alongside the railway road selling everything from fish to traditional snacks,\
  \ the scene that I would not normally see every day. The pungent smell of fish stung\
  \ my nose as I squeezed among the tourists. \u201CSawadee ka\u201D was said frequently\
  \ by the shopkeepers who were arranging their goods. I noticed they opened their\
  \ stalls merely on the floor with one or two tables without bothering a train would\
  \ pass through. \n\nWhen the railway signal was finally heard, the vendors folded\
  \ the upper tent to give space for the train to pass and all of the curious tourists\
  \ stood patiently ready with their selfie sticks, their cameras, their mobile phones,\
  \ trying to be as near as the approaching train even though light rain started to\
  \ pour. As it passed, it whistled all the way to warn people to step aside, causing\
  \ more crowd as there was a very little space between the train and the stalls.\
  \ A little kid stepped on my foot, but it did not bother me because all I know that\
  \ I was standing so close to the passing train that I felt it right in front of\
  \ my eyes. I never expected to be so close to the train before, not that I would\
  \ do in any other places but the entire wait paid off after capturing that experience.\n\
  \nHow the ordinary Maeklong railway market can turn into the most awaited attraction\
  \ has stunned all the visitors, including me. The squeezing, the damp air, and the\
  \ effort in finding space to witness this rare spectacular view worth a lot."
