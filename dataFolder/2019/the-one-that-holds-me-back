Text: "The sky was greeting me with a little bit of sad grey when I got off of the\
  \ train. Through the naked tree branches, I could see a huge traditional building\
  \ soaring in its own elegant way. The greenery behind is framing the oh-so-Japanese\
  \ picturesque, and it constantly reminds me that I am not in the comfort of my homeland.\n\
  \n It has been exactly 97 days since I came to Japan and yet I still feel a little\
  \ bit uncomfortable in it. Spending my last 3 years learning Korean history made\
  \ me feel somewhat eerie when I think of this country. I still do when I stepped\
  \ my foot on this city, Arita. \u2018Arita-Birthplace of Porcelain\u2019 it said\
  \ on the tourist map made of porcelain right outside the Kami-Arita Station.\n\n\
  The town itself is isolated by the Okawachiyama mountains. The buildings are very\
  \ traditional and well preserved. It gives you the vibe of medieval Japan with the\
  \ right amount of modernity by the passing cars and the roads built around it. You\
  \ can feel the delicacy of tradition in the air.\n\u201CHere, you can find every\
  \ house has its own chimney. It\u2019s fascinating.\u201D Said Chuel, my best friend\
  \ with excitement.\n\n\u201COh, really? Interesting.\u201D I snort my nose. It was\
  \ cold and windy outside. I hate my runny nose. I guess I miss warm weather more\
  \ than I should. I start looking for the chimney around. Nothing.\n\nMy friends\
  \ and I walked past the building that turned out to be a home/shop of craftsmen\
  \ family. The architecture is breathtaking. It has two enormous porcelain-wrapped\
  \ pillars in the front and other two human-sized porcelain decorating the entrance.\
  \ I was impressed yet confused at the same time. I find myself contemplating every\
  \ time I see something admirable in Japan. The suffering of Korean colonization\
  \ keeps budging me. \nI remember the war, the pain, and agony in so many Korean\
  \ poetry. I reminisce the prose telling a story about losing one\u2019s hometown.\
  \ I recall the suffering of running away from one\u2019s motherland to survive.\
  \ I lost in my own thought.\n\nWe came inside the building and looked around the\
  \ shop. There were tons of potteries. Small, big, functional, accessories, you name\
  \ it, it is all available. Each of the pottery has its own price tag under. We didn\u2019\
  t dare to look at the numbers. In a distant, we could hear the family chatting in\
  \ Japanese. It was weirdly soothing. Home. I feel like I was home.\n\nThis feeling\
  \ is so familiar. Intimate and obscure at once.\n\n\u201CJapanese people are polite\
  \ people. They will put others above themselves, and we should respect that,\u201D\
  \ Jin told me one day when we were walking to the dorm.\n\nI remember the attentive\
  \ people listening to me even though they don\u2019t know what I say. I recall all\
  \ my sweet friends ready to help when I need them. I reminisce the innocence in\
  \ every person\u2019s eyes I met. My heart\u2019s colliding itself.\n\nThen, I let\
  \ myself go. This past three days of my trip has been fun because of my friends.\
  \ It wasn\u2019t because I enjoy Japan. Spending years thinking that Japan is always\
  \ on the bad side made me hate my very own existence there. Why am I even here anyway?\
  \ I don\u2019t even want to look. I also don\u2019t want to apprehend. I was holding\
  \ into my thought. Now, I am trying to let go.\n\nThings that happened in the past\
  \ was something that will never be able to be changed. However, the current Japanese\
  \ citizens may not even know about them. The issues are between governments. How\
  \ they manage and educate their people.\n\nThe comfort of living here makes me heal\
  \ and grow as a person. Now, all I can do is relishing myself with this fulfillment.\
  \ Because to understand one\u2019s nation from the inside is a privilege that not\
  \ everyone gets."
