Text: "First experience in my life ... I can\u2019t believe that I see the best panoramic\
  \ with my eyes..\nWhen I was small I always saw the nice panoramic on the calendar...Mountain\
  \ Views covered by the snow... and very unbelievable because you thought that was\
  \ only just a portrait  that human created . And I never thought before that is\
  \ my best experience when I visit to Switzerland..I saw with my naked eyes the view\
  \ like a human paint on the canvas... And I\u2019m feelings thankful for the creatures...\n\
  The views it\u2019s unbelievable...\nAnd I heard some people said the local people\u2019\
  s its very humble & loyal ...\nSecond days in Switzerland I\u2019m heading to the\
  \ mount titlis.. the weather it\u2019s quite nice because I\u2019m visit on July...\n\
  So not too much snow covered the mountain \nYou can see the views on the cable cars\
  \ is wonderful..\nAmazing experience in my life \nI saw the panorama really clear\
  \ and the color it\u2019s very sharp.\nI talking to my self one day i will spend\
  \ my retire time in there.. hahaha \nOopst.. I forgot to tell something.. I left\
  \ my bags when I stay in Zurich hotel and the employee very respectful & humble\
  \  to respond  my calls. And they settle all for me to return my bag. An a short\
  \ story...\nI really loved the place ..my heart really peacefully... and relax..\n\
  So that was my story and my journey about Switzerland...thank you..."
