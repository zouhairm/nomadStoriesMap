Text: "So everyone in india wants to go to goa atleast once. Some with family, some\
  \ with friends, some with their love. And why not, it is one of most beautiful places\
  \ in india. So i did to with my sisters.\nGoa do not offer ola or uber you need\
  \ to use their local taxi service which is available almost everywhere. We took\
  \ a taxi from a small station Madgaon. The route to our hotel was really pretty\
  \ we could see those backside waters and small boats people on streets. The most\
  \ attractive things was the houses, small, different colour and attractive. \nBeleza\
  \ by the beach, the place where we stayed. Situated in south goa and very beautiful.\
  \ The room was clean and hatw a view of swimming pool and backside water. A small\
  \ balcony where we could sit liaten to good music n enjoy the view. \nOne thing\
  \ great about south goa is, the beaches are clean and less populated and pretty\
  \ cafes near the beaches.\nWhen people go to goa all they see is beaches, casino,\
  \ boat ride, water sports and only famous church. But what they dont see is the\
  \ streets of old goa with different architecture. The stairs on the back side of\
  \ the streets for the people leaving on a higher level. The people not knowing your\
  \ language but still inviting you for drinks, the hidden cafes with beautiful aura\
  \ and good food, the small hidden church used by the people living in the area.\n\
  Evry part of goa has a different lifestyle. North goa is known for parties and cheap\
  \ bt good stay. Beaches little crowded but no one woyld make you feel like and outsider.\
  \ Grab a drink with a random person and enjoy the party with them.\nDona paula for\
  \ the tourist attraction. The clean water and the cold breeze would invite you over\
  \ there again and again \nOld goa for the church and the old architecture. \nSouth\
  \ goa for clean beautiful private beaches where you can take a long walk and enjoy\
  \ the sunset bt the beach. The stay here is little expensive then most of the other\
  \ part but its worth it. You want peace and somr me time then south goa is amazing\
  \ for that.\nFountainhass for the cute cafes and old houses some locked some still\
  \ open less crowded and good space \nAnd then some still unexplored streets calling\
  \ on to be explored the house to tiny and cute the cafe so hidden and pretty  the\
  \ architect that of some different kind and people on door with a smile."
