Text: "A cold but sunny morning in May, on the way to the airport\u2026excitement\
  \ building. The day had finally arrived that I had been waiting months for!\nI was\
  \ embarking on a journey of a lifetime, something I\u2019d only ever dreamed of\
  \ and now it had finally become a reality. \n\nNerves growing high once we landed\
  \ in London Heathrow, an airport that is said to have the highest security in the\
  \ world, worried that something would go wrong, immigration would find something\
  \ wrong with my visa or paperwork to enter into the country. \nAfter months of meticulous\
  \ planning I should have known I didn\u2019t need to worry, I made it through security\
  \ and out into the arrivals terminal. \n\nI had made it to London at long last,\
  \ made it to England. Finally!!\n\nA cold and sunny morning in London, I got a taxi\
  \ transfer from Heathrow to Fulham where I was staying until I could find more permanent\
  \ accommodation.\n\nIt was very early morning so there wasn\u2019t a lot of traffic\
  \ around just yet especially being a weekend. \nOf course, being a weekend the hostel\
  \ office wasn\u2019t open yet either!\nWandering around the area I stumbled upon\
  \ the great Thames River, muddy, dirty greenish colour in the sunshine with a few\
  \ people out early enjoying the sunshine. In the middle of a heatwave it was already\
  \ heating up quite considerably. \nPeople out on a walking track dressed in their\
  \ active wear, kids running around squealing and screaming in delight at being outside\
  \ and not restricted to their inside voices. Parents enjoying the sunshine, the\
  \ fresh air, the freedom of not having to settle their children. \nBikers riding\
  \ past in twos and threes, the birds chirping happily in the trees, a slight breeze\
  \ coming up rustling the leaves and bringing some relief to those to heavily dressed\
  \ for the early morning heat. \nI had already stripped off a few layers not realising\
  \ it would be so hot. \n\nIt was glorious to be able to relax and enjoy the sounds,\
  \ the sight and the feeling of being present in amongst the heart of London. \n\n\
  After a few hours, eventually being checked into accommodation, I ventured out to\
  \ take a look around London. \nThe real excitement starts, getting on the tube for\
  \ the first time ever!! I was so excited, so many friends had talked about how easy\
  \ and convenient it was, and I had always wanted to be on it. \nIt\u2019s certainly\
  \ an experience when you first go on, it\u2019s easy and convenient to be sure and\
  \ as a tourist it was fabulous!!\nThe poles in each train colour coded to their\
  \ line, the driver over the intercom announcing your station as you go, and of course\
  \ telling you off for leaning against the doors. \nGetting off the tube and navigating\
  \ the winding tunnels up to the exit in amongst crowds of people all battling against\
  \ each other to be out and done with the day and be home to their families and lives.\
  \ \nLooking around at the people rushing about their busy lives not stopping for\
  \ a moment to take in their surrounds, wondering if that would become me one day\
  \ after living here for a while.\nThe cacophony of sounds coming from outside as\
  \ I exited the tube station, people crowding around, busy rushing for buses and\
  \ tubes, busy talking to friends, lining up to get the last show of the day. \n\
  Playing music and dancing around Piccadilly Circus, the evening creating a warm\
  \ sunny atmosphere, the smell of cigarettes, food from nearby restaurants and people\
  \ walking past with Haagen Dazs ice cream. \n\nIt was a joyous day and evening,\
  \ a dream come true to finally be in England.\nWandering around, thinking what my\
  \ life here will become\u2026."
