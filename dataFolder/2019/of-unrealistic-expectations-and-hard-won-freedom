Text: "Ammi pressed her palms deep enough into her forehead to iron out the wrinkles.\
  \ The lines on her mouth deepened as if in protest. \u201CAnd your father says yes?\u201D\
  \ \n\nI assented. Getting the patriarch on board had been the obvious priority.\
  \ Once Baba had agreed to our outlandish proposal, it was all smooth sailing. Well,\
  \ apart from dealing with my mother\u2019s chronic, unmanageable anxiety, but we\
  \ had tons of experience with that.\n\n\u201CAll sorts of things go on in Thailand,\u201D\
  \ my mother informed me, eyes shining with the light of a thousand tragic anecdotes.\
  \ \u201CGirls get trafficked \u2013 wait, let me show you this Whatsapp story \u2013\
  \u201C\n\n\u201CAmmi, we live in KARACHI,\u201D I pointed out. \u201CIf I can handle\
  \ being a girl here, I can handle it anywhere. And it\u2019s only a week!\u201D\n\
  \nNothing placated her. I may as well have been offering solace to a wall. Four\
  \ girls in a strange country, all on their own? (No, the oxymoron isn\u2019t lost\
  \ on me.) For weeks, she\u2019d drop dire warnings out of nowhere, hangdog expression\
  \ perpetual as the hot July sun. \n\nI held my ground. My sisters held their ground.\
  \ \n\nSome might find it silly, but at the time, nothing felt more urgent than this\
  \ trip. It\u2019s hard to explain to non-Pakistanis the lived politics of simply\
  \ existing as a woman in this country. There\u2019s no concept of liberty being\
  \ a birthright for us. On the streets and within the confines of the house, every\
  \ morsel of freedom is to be fought for, snatched away by wiles or force. \n\nDon\u2019\
  t get me wrong. They\u2019re worth the fight, those delicious little bites. But\
  \ they\u2019re still scraps, and hard-earned to the point of acid tears and a deep,\
  \ abiding bone-weariness. My sisters and I needed something filling. Something gulped\
  \ with ease.\n\nThe four of us had never traveled outside Pakistan together. In\
  \ a month\u2019s time, my sister Zuha would be leaving for the US to pursue her\
  \ higher education. All we wanted was one week together. One week of staying out\
  \ past 10 pm without panicked phone calls from home. One week of our clothing not\
  \ being policed with eyes that would put Holmes\u2019 to shame. One week of unfettered\
  \ laughter and sheer non-answerability to the family elders who held such sway over\
  \ our lives. \n\nWhy yes, the weight of unreasonable expectations did hang heavy\
  \ over our little trip.\n\nAt the airport, my sister Hira had a short-lived breakdown,\
  \ fueled by the intense pressure we\u2019d faced at home. A ball of piss-inducing\
  \ anxiety comfortably lodged itself inside the pit of my stomach: what if something\
  \ did happen? Unrealistic scenario followed surrealist scenario throughout the plane\
  \ ride, my surging adrenaline heightening their nightmarishness.\n\nAnd then the\
  \ plane dipped under the gold-flecked clouds, and I got a glimpse of the city that\
  \ was to be home for the next three days. A burst of pelting rain heralded us, their\
  \ sweet patter welcoming us to this fragrant land. I turned to look at my sisters\
  \ and saw the glow on my face reflected in theirs. My ball of anxiety dissolved,\
  \ unheeded.\n\nThat first magical night in Bangkok, we headed over to Khao San Road\
  \ and lost ourselves in the crowd. Loud, noisy, exploding at the seams with life\
  \ and people \u2013 a cacophony of screaming and music and shrieking food vendors\
  \ and raucous bars that we were swept up in with the immediacy of a birthright and\
  \ we bought strange street food and joyfully danced in the streets with what seemed\
  \ like the rest of the world, cheering with plentiful air in our lungs. \n\nWe stayed\
  \ on that road until 1 am, just existing with a crowd that was just existing.\n\n\
  We swallowed the freedom like wine."
