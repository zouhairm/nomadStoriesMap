Text: "I stared blankly at what looked like a cross between some kind of monument\
  \ and a glorified doll house. The structure was built with the traditional pink\
  \ \u201Ctufa\u201D stone, responsible for granting Yerevan it\u2019s nickname of\
  \ the \u201CPink City.\u201D Although my first thought screamed \"monument it is\
  \ likely that I was also just not used to the beauty of even everyday Armenian buildings,\
  \ prompting everything to seem extraordinary. To top it off, it was in the middle\
  \ of what appeared to be a children\u2019s park. This, later I learned, was true.\n\
  \nYerevan is a fascinating city on the crux of a cultural revolution, undergoing\
  \ rapid development across fields. It shows - you can feel this energy across the\
  \ city. Armenia's velvet revolution, notably peaceful in nature as well as youth\
  \ driven, happened in 2018. It was exemplified by its culmination. The appointment\
  \ of the opposition leader, Nikol Pashinyan happened without a single bullet fired.\
  \ A non violent revolution is an accomplishment anywhere in the world in this day\
  \ and age, but is especially so in a Post-Soviet state. This victory prompted a\
  \ spirited, celebratory snowball fight in Yerevan\u2019s central square, with snow\
  \ brought in truckloads.\n\nEveryone we met in Yerevan had a fierce, potent sense\
  \ of national pride, a uniquely Armenian brand. From our tour guide that morning,\
  \ who took us to the 4th century Geghard (\u201CSpear\u201D) Monestary, a Pagan\
  \ temple and the beautiful Lake Sevan. to the effortlessly cool culture crowd catching\
  \ up in the red lit corners of Embassy club. The Armenian Genocide of 1915-1917,\
  \ which our tour guide had painstakingly explained has yet to receive the international\
  \ recognition that it deserves, surely contributes. \n\nOne member of the artistic\
  \ community who grew up abroad as part of their rich diaspora, explained that there\
  \ was some inherited sense of guilt from the trauma. Largely, though, today's Armenians\
  \ hold no qualms with this. Rather, they seem to channel it into their work, transforming\
  \ their tiny, land-locked country into a cultural powerhouse. More than anything,\
  \ Armenians revel in their stunning history. \"Yerevan 2800\" signs are littered\
  \ across the buildings in the city, signifying the  recent 2800th anniversary of\
  \ this ancient city - even older than Rome.\n\nSeeing other people who seemed in\
  \ the know walk into the building indicated that this must be it. We that we knew\
  \ Eva, an amazing visual and sound art curator who was involved with running the\
  \ space, and a force to be reckoned with in the Yerevan arts scene. We had the privilege\
  \ of dining with her at Dolmama the previous night, a restaurant visited by the\
  \ likes of the Kardashians, George Clooney, the Clinton\u2019s, Putin, among others.\
  \ It specialises in a delicious stuffed grape leaf dish of the Caucus region, that\
  \ I am excitingly awaiting catching fire back home in the United States.\n\nAs soon\
  \ as we got in, we experienced complete sensory overload. A 7 person DJ set was\
  \ filling the room and I was overwhelmed by the sounds, in the most pleasant way\
  \ imaginable. A futuristic DJ set, with live instruments such as a keyboard, guitar,\
  \ etc. ripple in the background. With it, I hear traditional Armenian influences,\
  \ as well as even Jazz influences. It was the kind of music that fills you up completely,\
  \ and is impossible to simply have it fade into the bathroom. I recalled earlier\
  \ in the day being told that \"Armenians love jazz\" I guess that was true. \n\n\
  Following a magical night,I walked down the streets, still magnetic. We catch a\
  \ glimpse of the majestic Mount Ararat, for which Armenia\u2019s signature Ararat\
  \ Brandy, treasured by the likes of Winston Churchill, was named. Mount Ararat is\
  \ regarded a sacred symbol, and based on Christianity is thought to house Noah\u2019\
  s Ark itself underneath its grand, eternally snow-covered peaks. As soon as I return\
  \ to my hotel room, I reach for some of the delicious Gata I bought at the monastery\
  \ that same morning. Gata is a rich bread, filled with a delicious sugar walnut\
  \ filling. I savor the taste, as I begin to savor my memories of the day. I feel\
  \ lucky to have experienced Yerevan in this precise moment, and cannot wait to see\
  \ what is to come."
