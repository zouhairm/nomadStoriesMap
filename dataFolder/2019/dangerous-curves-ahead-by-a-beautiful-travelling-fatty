Text: "Let me state calorically you cannot hide dangerous curves and waves, no matter\
  \ how much black clothing and spandex you wear. As a fat woman who has travelled\
  \ far and wide I say \u2018do not be afraid of exposing your curves\u2019.  In exposing\
  \ yourself you will gain entry into places and experiences you never dreamed possible.\n\
  \nI recommend you always accept an invitation from a friend to visit a Japanese\
  \ onsen.  However, be aware a traditional onsen modesty towel is the size and dimensions\
  \ of a small hand towel. It is at this moment you panic, and start evaluating which\
  \ part of your body needs protection against public exposure.  Do not waste time,\
  \ eventually you be naked in front of a crowd, hold your minuscule modesty towel\
  \ high like a beacon of hope. Or wave it like a white flag.  No amount of slouching\
  \ and fast walking is going to distract others from noticing your true identity.\
  \  Also, the bath water is almost at boiling point, and only a slow descent is possible.\
  \ In my experience, a good posture and a wide smile are the greatest accessories\
  \ a woman can own.\n\nNever protest too strongly by playing swimming tog tug-a-war\
  \ with an elderly Turkish bathhouse employee. The amount of energy and anxiety you\
  \ dispense will deprive you of the most superb body and mind exfoliation. My advice\
  \ is go with the flow, unless you are in a public space in Sri Lanka and a male\
  \ masseuse instructs you to take off your bra.  Be smart about when and where you\
  \ expose yourself.\n\nAnd always remember when fat travels it will receive undo\
  \ attention from strangers.  Do not take the comments and insults to heart.  In\
  \ my adventures along the Peruvian section of the Amazon I met one of the local\
  \ riverbank tribes.  As the all male crew and I disembarked I heard a little girl\
  \ squeal \u2018Hola Bonita Gorita!\u2019 It took me a matter of seconds to eyeball\
  \ the little squealer, dressed in worn underpants, waving ecstatically and continuing\
  \ to squeal this welcome at me. I stood in shock not trusting my translation skills.\
  \  Bonita Gorita translated to Beautiful Fatty.  By the crew\u2019s expressions\
  \ my translation was spot-on.  I did not take offence, as I quickly evaluated her\
  \ description of me as fact.  I am a beautiful fatty. Just add \u2018travelling\u2019\
  \ in the mix and it's a winner!\n\nAs a weathered fat traveller who has cultured\
  \ the art of dive-bombing into situations, and acts, which single me out, expose\
  \ my outer layers, and play hard on my insecurities, I believe wholeheartedly there\
  \ are no restrictions on fat travelling."
