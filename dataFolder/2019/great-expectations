Text: "Monday. 11 a.m. A moment in which the city is dead, just like the mood of the\
  \ white collars sitting in front of their laptops in those scary, tall and cold\
  \ buildings. Souls that have been drowning in tears, not only in coffee. But this\
  \ is something they will never admit to.\n\nHere, the leaves are dancing their final\
  \ waltz in front of the lucky watchers, heading down towards the origin while holding\
  \ the promise of resurrection. Who are these lucky watchers? The little children\
  \ who are ignoring the coppery landscape and focusing on the playground\u2019s rainbow.\
  \ The old people who forgot how to appreciate the small things in life and worry\
  \ if they will live to experience tomorrow. There is no smile you can find on their\
  \ faces. They have been lost through the choices they had made a long time ago.\
  \ But the leaves don\u2019t care. When spring arrives, they will return and they\
  \ know it. Maybe that\u2019s why death is so easy to bear now. How else could they\
  \ create such a symphony of colour and dance right there on the death row? Only\
  \ by trusting the promise of renaissance.\n\nAnd then there\u2019s me. A spectator\
  \ or even the leading act of the play. Doesn\u2019t matter, I consider myself more\
  \ of a lost soul, anchored both on Earth and in Heaven. Anchored here on Earth because\
  \ of the beauty I see everywhere \u2013 in the trees, on the streets, in the eyes\
  \ of a happy couple holding hands. And then I wonder\u2026 \u201DWhy I am not in\
  \ one of those offices?\u201D Because I chose the present. To live. To travel. To\
  \ live life now. To enjoy it. I chose to be my own anchor, compass, sail and wind.\
  \ I just need to steer towards happiness.\n\nThe little ones look at me with curiosity.\
  \ The elderly with mixed feelings. 180 degrees later, I feel the same about them.\
  \ I am curious when the children will realise the importance of their choices and\
  \ when the elderly will see that is never too late.\n\nI didn\u2019t expect to find\
  \ wind so far away from home."
