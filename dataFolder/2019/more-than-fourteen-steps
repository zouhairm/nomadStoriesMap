Text: "It's midday when we arrive at our destination and the final stop of the train\
  \ ride; Tegernsee, a resort town in the Miesbach district of Bavaria, Germany.\n\
  \nFollowing my local German friend and host Tobi; as he leads the way to the starting\
  \ point of the hiking trail. We march up a gruelling steep tarred road on this perfect\
  \ summers day. \n\nWelcomed by the bleating of grazing goats, we find ourselves\
  \ at the beginning of our days adventure. \"Which route should we take?\" he asks,\
  \ as we both look up at the yellow arrows indicating the direction of the different\
  \ trails. \"The pretty one\" I answer.\n\nStraight and left we go, embarking on\
  \ the Riederstein trail. Walking along a slope, Tobi runs ahead of me and with the\
  \ sound of rustling of leaves and crackling of twigs I find him in-between the plants\
  \ in search of what he says are, \"forest strawberries.\"\n\nHe passes me a tiny\
  \ red berry which looks like candy. Sceptical of eating anything in nature, I hold\
  \ the berry between my fingers questioning whether it is safe to eat. \"Just try\
  \ it!\" Tobi yells from in-between the plants. \"It tastes like candy!\"\n\nThe\
  \ explosion of candy like flavour in my mouth has me searching for my own as I too\
  \ get into the plants searching for the biggest and best looking forest strawberries.\
  \ Tobi grabs my hand as I nearly slip in the dense bushes trying to get back onto\
  \ the trail.\n\nOur walk continues uphill, with the occasional stop for picking\
  \ of my new favourite wild treat. An elderly couple walking downhill passes us by,\
  \ the first people we encounter since the start of the trail an hour ago.We nod\
  \ our heads and murmur \"Guten Tag\" in politeness.\n\nWe reach a summit cross known\
  \ as Pfliegeleck; to the right a bench and a wood cross approximately four meters\
  \ high, to the left through the forest trees a view pleasing to the eye; an unspoilt\
  \ view of the sparkling lake of Tegernsee.\n\nI stand facing the lake, thankful\
  \ for the experience. My attention is drawn to an orange butterfly as it elegantly\
  \ flutters towards and rests upon a tall white lace like flower.\n\nThe rest of\
  \ the trail is flat and lined with skyscraper trees.\n\nAs we access a craggy path\
  \ with exposed tree roots; I stop at a wood carving depicting the first station\
  \ of the cross where Jesus is condemned to death (The stations of the cross is a\
  \ fourteen step Catholic story that offers witness of Jesus walk to his crucifixion).\
  \ I walk at a slow pace as I gaze at each station before passing the next one.\n\
  I learn that this part of the trail is known as \"the way of the cross\" and leads\
  \ to a lookout point on Riederstein Mountain. Stopping at the tenth station, Tobi\
  \ whispers, \" Father forgive them, for they know not what they do.\"\n\nFilled\
  \ with a feeling of warmth and excitement, I continue to follow Tobi up what has\
  \ now become a steep path with alternative steps.\n\nFinally reaching the lookout\
  \ point, I stare up a flight of wood stairs, eager to discover what's at the top.\
  \ Taking his hand, we make our way up the staircase. \"WOW!\" I exclaim as a cute\
  \ little chapel appears before me. With eagerness to view the interior, I immediately\
  \ make my way to the front door and gain access. Many emotions pass through me as\
  \ I kneel before the gated altar, expressing my gratitude for this experience.\n\
  \nDisturbed by the outside voices of an American tour group, I prepare to exit the\
  \ chapel and sign the guest book as a lasting memory.\n\nI make my way around the\
  \ chapel to the back where Tobi is enjoying panoramic views of the valley, with\
  \ pops of red from the roofs of the Bavarian homes. Fearful but brave enough, I\
  \ too climb over the barrier to join him on the other side. Carefully I make my\
  \ way down to the mountain rock below.\n\nWith blue above and blue below, I rest\
  \ my head on his shoulder as I feel the solitude of the forest and contentment from\
  \ the day."
