Text: "I\u2019ve just got back from a four-day stay in Berlin which was inspired by\
  \ the fact that this year, two days after my birthday, is the 20th Anniversary of\
  \ the fall of the Berlin wall. It was my first visit to Germany and I am so glad\
  \ that I chose Berlin as my first stop. I was just two years old when the wall was\
  \ broken, but I am well aware of just how important this date is.  \n \nThe contrast\
  \ between East and West is evident, even after twenty years of liberation from the\
  \ Iron Curtain. The wall has fallen and the wound is closed but evidence of the\
  \ scar, running like a barrier across the country, still remains. This dichotomy\
  \ was highlighted by the two tours that I took; the excellent free New Europe tour\
  \ focuses on the History and landmarks of the city while the superb alternative\
  \ tour focuses on the graffiti/squat culture of Eastern Berlin. Both tours emphasised\
  \ perfectly the East/West divide.  \n \nBerlin is a memorable, diverse and impressive\
  \ city. The complex nature of its past, and the bearings that this past has undoubtedly\
  \ had on its present and future, means that it feels both young and old at the same\
  \ time. The stunning Brandenburg Gate looks over the Pariser Platz and is just a\
  \ minute away from the beautiful, grand Reichstag. Our excellent guide, Karin, told\
  \ us that the quadriga which adorns the gate was stolen by Napoleon during his occupation\
  \ of Berlin in 1806 but subsequently restored in 1814. Victoria\u2019s olive wreath\
  \ was replaced by an iron cross, an emblem of militarism, and the statue forever\
  \ faces the French Embassy to symbolise that Germany must always keep watch over\
  \ France. Aspects of the city such as this emphasise the history and age of Berlin.\
  \ These magnificent monuments are testament to another era and, when viewed side\
  \ by side with New Berlin, possess a sense of otherworldliness.    \n \nNew and\
  \ modern parts of the city such as the Postdamer Platz shopping centre, which looks\
  \ just like Metropolis, and the trendy East-end Mitte district with its edgy fashion\
  \ shops and Alexanderplatz shopping area, are a world away from the other, older,\
  \ Berlin. On the alternative tour, we visited Yaam, a popular site by the river\
  \ complete with artificial beach and a so-laid-back-that-it\u2019s-horizontal atmosphere.\
  \ The graffiti group parts of the city are a complete dichotomy in comparison to\
  \ Old Berlin. This oftentimes frowned-upon sub-culture provides a taste of freedom\
  \ and brings the city into cutting-edge modernity. \n \nRelaxed as it is though,\
  \ New Berlin has a message. The graffiti culture, which continues to thrive and\
  \ shows no signs of stopping, highlights that actions speak louder than words. There\
  \ are some things that cannot yet be spoken. They adorn the Berlin wall remains,\
  \ they decorate the squat buildings of the Eastern front. There are barriers yet.\
  \ But they are crumbling.\n \nThings have been lost. But things are being found\
  \ too. The face of Berlin is changing at a rapid rate. I can\u2019t wait to visit\
  \ again a few years down the line and see how things have progressed. The ruins\
  \ are remnants of what has passed. It is imperative that they remain; it is crucial\
  \ that we remember."
