Text: "\u201CWhere the f--- is the purple hippopotamus?\u201D\n\nThese were the first\
  \ words I uttered out loud in Japan 6 years ago. It\u2019s late \u2013 about 9:30pm\
  \ or so \u2013 and I\u2019ve finally arrived at the correct subway station in Osaka.\
  \ I\u2019ve never traveled solo before, nor did I plan this trip to be some soul-searching\
  \ expedition. I found myself here on this rainy corner, desperately examining my\
  \ host\u2019s instructions for more clues, because I had decided to leave my graduate\
  \ school one semester in to pursue a new career and was no longer allowed to be\
  \ part of the Winter Break excursion I signed up for. \n\nI begin walking straight\
  \ from the exit after accepting the fact I can\u2019t pinpoint \u201CSouth\u201D\
  . I\u2019m nervous and I have no idea where I\u2019m going, being the person who\
  \ spent $1,000 on a plane ticket yet felt it excessive to spring for the $40 international\
  \ data plan. A deep bout of paranoia kicks in as I scan my printed map. What if\
  \ someone sees my multiple ear piercings and lock me up? I am the farthest corner\
  \ away from edgy and avant garde, but the consistent paranoia fed to me at home\
  \ insist otherwise. My piercings were an evil plan from my so-called friends to\
  \ ensure I wouldn\u2019t be hired, my mother had warned me through tears. Couldn\u2019\
  t I see? Everyone was staring at me.\n\nA few lovey couples and some teenagers wander\
  \ by before I see the purple hippopotamus emerge as a faint neon sign. It\u2019\
  s a bar, or a club, and I feel a funny sense of realization mixed with relief. The\
  \ next step is easy: cross the street and count 3 houses down for a bamboo-lined\
  \ entrance. My host greets me in a whisper with a cup of genmaicha, scratching his\
  \ head as he attempts to explain the concept of a bidet and a pump shower to a confused\
  \ American.\n\nAfter he leaves I sneak in a slice of white bread \u2013 the rules\
  \ state we\u2019re not supposed to eat separately from the other guests, but I\u2019\
  m starved \u2013 before I head upstairs. I\u2019ve forgotten this is a traditional\
  \ Japanese house, and there are only bamboo mats and sleeping cots. The WiFi doesn\u2019\
  t work after 10pm, so I can\u2019t translate the furnace instructions. My butt is\
  \ sore from a long flight and now I am also wet, tired, hungry and lonely. And suddenly\
  \ \u2013 very, very angry.\n\nIt takes me a second, but words bloom naturally. How\
  \ did you forget this detail of the trip? My father is yelling at my mother as we\
  \ drive through the red tufts of Arizona, trying to find our way back to the highway.\
  \ You should feel bad, you made us miss the turn! His blame was easy to internalize\
  \ then, and now I also find it the easiest line from being uncomfortable to being\
  \ in control. So worthless and stupid, I hear my voice intertwine with his as I\
  \ close my eyes and fall asleep. Only we can love you.\n\nThe next few weeks traveling\
  \ around Japan and South Korea were just as lonely as the first night. But with\
  \ no one there to temper my feelings, or refute and dismiss them, I eventually had\
  \ to look at the person I saw myself as and compare it to the person others saw\
  \ me as. Maybe, I contemplated for the first time, I didn\u2019t have to live with\
  \ such self-hatred.\n\nOn my very last day, I took the bullet train to the airport\
  \ and ended up heading in the exact opposite direction. I instantly knew something\
  \ was wrong when the countryside flew by in hiccups of green and blue, but the next\
  \ stop was not for dozens of miles. I rushed off for a transfer and boarded the\
  \ returning train as doors were closing. I was breathless, a few rolls of sweat\
  \ beginning to form along the straps of my backpack, and perhaps for the first time,\
  \ before I could be swallowed by the ugliness of my past, I found a seat by the\
  \ window, fished out a squished piece of mochi, and I ate, waited for my stop to\
  \ come, and forgave myself."
