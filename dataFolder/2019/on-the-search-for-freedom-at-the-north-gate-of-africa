Text: "The Berber people are considered the 'native people' of this region of North\
  \ Africa and the nomadic life is an important part of their culture. These people\
  \ have spent centuries exploring the Sahara Desert, the world's largest desert,\
  \ with an impressive 9 million square kilometers. They are well known as the Imazighen,\
  \ or Amazigh (in singular), a word that states the meaning of 'free men'. And this\
  \ was why, to spend the night in this desert then became part of my goal:  the search\
  \ for the feeling of what it is like to be 'free', like an Amazigh.\nTwo days traveling\
  \ in a small van, listening to a lot of brazilian music, with a so called driver\
  \ driving at a doubtful speed. In this van, we practically crossed Morocco from\
  \ east to west. The guide shows himself to be very proud throughout this journey\
  \ on the road and I can understand why. At every blink of an eye, this tourist route\
  \ known as The thousand Kasbahs road, shows me the beauty of nature in every possible\
  \ way. \nKasbahs are ancient Berber strongholds built from a mixture of clay, manure\
  \ and straw. Some are listed by Unesco as in the city of Ouarzazate, the Moroccan\
  \ Hollywood. From Marrakech to Ouarzazate, where there is an overnight stay, there\
  \ are about five hours of asphalted roads and a good part of this path is to leave\
  \ anyone with their stomach rolled up. Guess a journey for freedom wouldn\u2019\
  t come from a straight path right?\nThe air is thick and a warm breeze enters the\
  \ windows of the van. These two days of travel that lead to the desert fill my eyes\
  \ with the diversity of the landscape. At every blick, I think to myself about how\
  \ wrong I was in stereotyping this country. There are no signs of dunes or camels.\
  \ All I see are green fields, valleys, rivers, mountains and, of course, oasis.\
  \ Specially this time of the year, olive trees and date palms can be seen at the\
  \ roadside. \nLittle did I know that Morocco is known for geographical diversity.\
  \ This part of the hinterland, the heart of the Atlas Mountains - the largest mountain\
  \ range in North Africa, separating the green side of the desert - is the birthplace\
  \ of the Berber civilization. \nIn the second stage of the trip, we start another\
  \ six hours drive to Erfoud, one of the gateways to the Moroccan Sahara. It is time\
  \ to leave our tiny (not so comfortable) van and continue on the back of a camel\
  \ until our final stop. \nA line of dromedaries flutters on the reddish sand floor\
  \ of the Sahara, leaving behind another sunset on the Erg Chebbi dune, the most\
  \ sought after in southern Morocco. With the sky already darkening, we balance anxiously\
  \ on the backs of the animals towards the most expected point of this trip: to camp\
  \ one night in the biggest desert in the world.\nThe back-and-forth and the slow\
  \ steps. The only sound that is heard is the camel's line walking through the sand\
  \ and the group's laughter. I look everywhere and all I see is an infinite immensity\
  \ of sand dunes being colored by the tones of a sun that slowly sets on the horizon.\
  \ \nI could try to put this sunset into words, but they would never live up to what\
  \ my eyes could see that evening. And then, when all that explosion of color disappears\
  \ behind those never-ending dunes, there comes the most starry sky I've ever seen.\
  \ \nI sit near the camp to observe in silence the Sahara unique, breathtaking beauty.\
  \ I had never seen anything like this anywhere else I\u2019ve been in the world\
  \ so far.\nThose majestic dunes moving like sand waves as an ocean frozen in time,\
  \ casting shadows of the sun and the moon in an endless game of lights. Tiny beetles,\
  \ ants, mice and camels leave their tracks in the sand until the wind covers them\
  \ up. If you look carefully, you can follow their tracks in the dunes until you\
  \ no longer remember where the camp is..."
