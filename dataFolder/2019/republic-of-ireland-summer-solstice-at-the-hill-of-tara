Text: "As my alarm blared, I couldn\u2019t help but contemplate whether I was truly\
  \ dedicated enough to get dressed and catch my taxi. Half begrudgingly, I fumbled\
  \ in the dark and pulled on the warmest sweater and pair of jeans I brought with\
  \ me. Grabbing my thorny leaf tiara, I rushed out the door with my home-stay sister\
  \ to meet up with the other two girls crazy enough to wake up at four in the morning\
  \ in the name of participating in ancient pagan sun rituals at the Hill of Tara.\n\
  \nWhen the taxi finally arrived, I could sense the amusement in the driver\u2019\
  s voice as he said hello. After giving our bleary-eyes and nymph-crowned-heads a\
  \ once over, he started off into the cold Irish darkness towards the sacred Celtic\
  \ gathering place.\n\nAs we pulled up to the site, I began to see the crowds of\
  \ gypsy-like people flocking towards the east side of the mounds. Nestling on the\
  \ top of the burial mounds, they began to make rings and settle in. Drums, banjos,\
  \ and guitars sang out while the smell of burning sage wafted into my nostrils.\
  \ To my right, a man stood with a raven on his shoulder. Intrigued, I complimented\
  \ him on his pet, to which he responded that Fait, the raven, is not his pet but\
  \ rather he is the pet of the raven. Despite this, he said that Fait seemed to enjoy\
  \ my presence and for this he wanted to impart one of her feather\u2019s upon me.\
  \ Simultaneously bewildered and honored, I accepted the feather and placed it in\
  \ my hair before turning back towards the area of the rising sun.\n\nI stood there\
  \ listening to the music as the sun began to rise and slowly warm my shivering body\
  \ with its warm golden rays. As the sun began to awaken, the trail of music began\
  \ to snake around the mounds. The drummers and singers formed a slithering line\
  \ that rhythmically walked around the ancient mounds. A chorus of song began to\
  \ ring out, speaking of the beauty of Tara which gives life to humanity.\n\nThe\
  \ song began to run as the sun rose higher, into the bloodied sky, until at last\
  \ the sun had risen fully above the horizon. To this, a man began to play his bagpipes\
  \ to commemorate the official start of the Summer Solstice.\n\nAfter breathing in\
  \ a few deep breaths and sitting in the green fields a bit more, we headed off to\
  \ a local cafe to get breakfast and start the morning. Throughout that day, I thought\
  \ that I would feel incredibly tired yet somehow, whether because of Fait\u2019\
  s or the sun\u2019s blessing, for the following fourteen hours of the day I felt\
  \ more rested and content than ever before."
