Text: "I still remembered the first time I stepped on the land of Lombok. I still\
  \ remembered how the Sasak people competed to offer their hand-weaved cloth and\
  \ tiny bracelets that made with full of detail in every inch of the threads. I still\
  \ remembered how soft the sand of Pink Beach was that infiltrated between my toes.\
  \ I still remembered cycling around Gili Trawangan without feeling worry of getting\
  \ hit by motor vehicles.\n\nThe thing I didn\u2019t remember was the very chaotic\
  \ scenery like that of Lombok in the past. 7 SR earthquake had destroyed most of\
  \ the Lombok Island. The houses that used to be stand firm were now flat on the\
  \ ground. No more studying peacefully under the ceiling except the blue sky.\n\n\
  Never did I expect to visit Lombok for the second time to be like that. I came to\
  \ visit Lombok that time as a volunteer, not a tourist. Me and other volunteers\
  \ from the mountaineering club in my university managed to collect 3 big sacks of\
  \ clothes and more than 25 million rupiahs fundings less than a week. We spent the\
  \ money we have collected to buy logistics such as tarpaulins, canned food, baby\
  \ needs and other logistics that needed by the earthquake victims. Then we brought\
  \ the logistics using pickup car for 24 hours driving from Bandung to Lombok by\
  \ ourselves.\n\nThe tired feeling of more than 800 miles driving was left no trace\
  \ when we saw the happy faces of the earthquake victims when receiving our donations.\
  \ We felt as if the energy that run out had been recharged by the excited face of\
  \ the children in the shelter when we gave them a drawing book and colored pencils.\n\
  \nOur visit to Lembah Sari Village in West Lombok that time was the exact day of\
  \  our national independence day which was 17th of August. We, indonesian, commonly\
  \ celebrate our independence day by plenty of simple race. So, we held a race there\
  \ of course with the prize that we had been prepared. The earthquake victims, especially\
  \ kids, were very enthusiastic joining the simple race. There was too much laughter\
  \ and jokes that happened on that day like there had been nothing happened. Like\
  \ there had been no earthquake before. I never expected to find a happiness in the\
  \ middle of sorrow. I found the fact that happiness was only real when shared. Maybe\
  \ they felt the same way. I thought, maybe disaster was made so that we know that\
  \ we\u2019re not alone and we have each other. I thought just maybe."
