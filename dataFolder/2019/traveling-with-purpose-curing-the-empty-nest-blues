Text: "What\u2019s more fun for a group of senior citizens than wielding machetes\
  \ and gathering food for elephants in a third-world country? Not much!\n\nAsk anyone\
  \ who loves to travel the reason why. You\u2019re likely to hear about exploring\
  \ new places and sharing experiences. But there\u2019s a new kind of travel adventure\
  \ for travelers aged fifty and over in which seniors\u2014and almost-seniors\u2014\
  do much more than share experiences; they create them for people in need.  \n\n\
  In Cambodia, volunteers build toilet rooms for villages. In Thailand they clean\
  \ up after rescued elephants. In Bali they plant baby mangrove trees, and in Costa\
  \ Rica they save endangered turtles.\n\nNo matter where the location or what the\
  \ service, one thing is certain\u2026. Mature travelers are making this world\u2014\
  in what may seem like the smallest of ways\u2014a little bit better for some of\
  \ the other people in it. \n\nAnd they pay to do it.\n\nHere\u2019s why\n\nWithin\
  \ an hour of hearing about We Are Bamboo, I had signed up to work in an elephant\
  \ sanctuary, picked travel dates, and talked two friends into going with me. Nine\
  \ months later, I was on a plane to Thailand, with only a vague idea of what was\
  \ ahead.\n\nThe next 16 days were among the most rewarding and fun days I will ever\
  \ experience. At one point, as I raised my machete and cut what felt like my millionth\
  \ bamboo tree, I looked around and wondered what on earth would bring strangers\
  \ from all over the world to a third-world country with nothing more than the promise\
  \ of hard work and a purpose for it. \n\nBy the end of my trip, I knew what had\
  \ brought us together:  It was Destiny. \n\nAnd if you don\u2019t buy that, then\
  \ here are three other reasons to consider taking a holiday that will change you\
  \ forever\u2014assuming you meet the age criteria, of course.\n\n1.  There is still\
  \ a lot of living to do!\n\nWhile we may not be able to choose the length of our\
  \ life, we can often choose the quality of it. Lori, a two-time cancer survivor\
  \ who built a water pump for a village in Siem Reap, says it is important for her\
  \ to work and give back while she still has the energy and the good health to make\
  \ a difference. She is someone who appreciates every second of her life. She fully\
  \ participates in every moment of it, and encourages others to do the same.\n\n\
  2.  We don\u2019t know everything\u2026 yet\n \nTeaching children in Cambodia was\
  \ as much learning for me as teaching for them. I saw children so poor they don\u2019\
  t have fresh water to bathe in and have to wear the same sweaters, day after day,\
  \ in sweltering heat. Despite this, children come to school. Teenagers work to support\
  \ their families. Adults work however and whenever they can. These are people whose\
  \ history includes genocide, Killing Fields and decimation. Their tenacity gives\
  \ me hope. I have learned from them what true resilience is.\n\n3.  It feels good\
  \ \n\nAs we get older, priorities change. The hustle and noise of ambition fades.\
  \ We no longer see the world as an ass to kick, but a little old lady to help across\
  \ the street. \n\nIt feels good to do good by caring for endangered animals or giving\
  \ a village water. Florida couple Kelly and Keith built a toilet room for a small\
  \ village. At the end of their project, they saw the grateful faces of people who\
  \ would now be using a proper bathroom. Kelly said to me, \u201CI\u2019ve never\
  \ felt like this after a vacation before. We\u2019ve made a difference to them.\u201D\
  \ \n\nThe stories are many. The needs are, too. The service-oriented travel experience\
  \ gives new options to Baby Boomers and Gen Xers who don\u2019t want to just see\
  \ the world, but impact the world they see. \n\nWhether that means stirring cement,\
  \ pulling plastic straws out of the ocean, or shoveling dung at a wildlife preserve,\
  \ those of us who participate leave vacation with much more than a souvenir or a\
  \ sunburn. We get the satisfaction of knowing that\u2014at least for a short time\u2014\
  we are truly, fully alive."
