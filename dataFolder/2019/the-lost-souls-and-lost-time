Text: "This story is one that has happened but hopefully, someday it will become a\
  \ reality. The thing I would be looking for in my travels would be answers and closure;\
  \ closure from knowing my biological parents, answers of why they left me in my\
  \ hospital room cold, sick, and alone for four long painful months, and answers\
  \ of why my mother and grandmother kept me from meeting the new chapter of my life\
  \ sooner rather than later. I was adopted when i was three, which for some people\
  \ that doesn't seem that long to be in an orphanage but for it being Russia and\
  \ in the economic state they were in during 2001, it caused the adoption system\
  \ to move quicker therefor if I was 4 years old I would have been moved into an\
  \ older kids home, which it is rare anyone makes it out of their. However, being\
  \ adopted in a small two-topped building with bad hygiene and was barely cleaned\
  \ each week with 50 other kids is not the reason I would want to travel to Russia,\
  \ the reason is the two people that made a choice to leave instead of staying and\
  \ fighting. For anyone that has been adopted and got the chance to meet the people\
  \ who gave them life, that's a nice gift, use it with all of your ability and see\
  \ them every chance you get. Getting to know your real parents is a chance many\
  \ don't get to have and in my case, I may never have. \nTherefore traveling to Russia\
  \ and trying to figure out where they could be or who they are would be the greatest\
  \ adventure of my life. Getting to see the heritage I was born from as well of the\
  \ form of life that my ethnicity stands for would be an experience like no other.\
  \ Not knowing is the most unsettling and annoying thing that could be, people asking\
  \ me who my real parents are and if would like to meet them and such gets tiring\
  \ and to be honest, it makes me sad because I have no clue what the future holds\
  \ for me and it's overwhelming. If I was to find my parent I would not expect it\
  \ since Russia as a whole is so large, however, I would narrow my search to around\
  \ the orphanage I was put into which was in Kaliningrad, Russia which is right between\
  \ Poland and Lithuania. My hope would be that it would give more of a chance of\
  \ finding them. \nPersonally, I believe that people don't really see the back story\
  \ of being adopted and how it is not just sunshine and rainbows, having to tell\
  \ people, you were abandoned by your parents because you were sick and premature.\
  \ Embarking on this adventure would allow me to try to get answers of why they left\
  \ and couldn't take care of me when they already had three children? They knew what\
  \ they were doing so why were they not prepared for the outcome? These questions\
  \ have gone racing through my mind for the last 18 years and the only way to get\
  \ results would be to walk the path they walked and figure out the circumstances\
  \ that led to that point. It would be a journey within a journey."
