Text: "This is sort of a backwards travel story. We lived in Bella Coola.  There,\
  \ in the middle of the Great Bear Rainforest, it rains for nearly eight months of\
  \ the year.  We looked to the airplane for salvation: lifting us above the fog to\
  \ a place where the sun still shone, unaffected by the storms below.\n\tThe First\
  \ Nations people survived the dark, barren winter by consuming large amounts of\
  \ fermented ooligan (fish) grease, which is rich in both Vitamins A and D.  I remember\
  \ a friend bringing a jar of her family's store to school one day \u2013 it looked\
  \ like liquid sunshine, glowing amber in the light from the window.  Comparatively\
  \ recent immigrants to the continent, my family wasn't used to that sort of thing;\
  \ it was the folly of the unfamiliar.  To me, it smelled bad, so why would I put\
  \ it in my mouth?  \n\tIn the absence of  'grease,' we drank fortified milk. When\
  \ our brain serotonin levels and Vitamin D stores languished we would flail, fighting\
  \ the tides of depression that ebbed and flowed like the waters of the salt chuck\
  \ that stretched for miles behind the hospital parking lot.  \n\tWe hoped our minds\
  \ would make it to the fifteenth of February when the sun would break over the horizon\
  \ between the mountains and our piddly sunshine ration of fifteen minutes per day\
  \ would begin again.  On special days when it wasn't clouded over, we would actually\
  \ get to feel some of this pure, unadulterated gold on our skin.\n\tEven if it wasn't\
  \ sunny in Vancouver, it was still lighter and brighter than Bella Coola; getting\
  \ out gave us a sort of psychic 'room to breathe,' even if it was just for a few\
  \ days.  I looked forward to the large, open skies, as well as widening my fashion\
  \ horizons.\n\tWe usually stayed at the Barclay Hotel and pounded the pavement in\
  \ a roughly ten-block radius.  That area between Robson and Granville used to be\
  \ the hip, young district.  It had everything. \n\tI remember the ambience of that\
  \ era: all the cool kids with their round sunglasses, tan skin, multiple piercings,\
  \ baggy jeans and Doc Martens would sit motionless, sprawled over the steps of the\
  \ Vancouver Art Gallery.  I was in awe.  My mother would pull me past the seller\
  \ carts, displaying hemp necklaces, ABC chokers, silver hoop earrings, body jewelry,\
  \ funky purses, and hippie hats on the way to The Bay where huge Calvin Klein ads\
  \ were displayed across multiple windows.  \n\tOne afternoon we stopped for tea\
  \ at Murchies.  I recall sitting at a table, and sipping steaming peach-flavoured\
  \ liquid that restored my soul and gave me strength to go on. After we wore out\
  \ our feet on the pavement we would go out for dinner, often at The Bread Garden.\
  \  (It has gone out of business since Dr. Atkins began the low-carb trend.)  \n\t\
  In the evening we strolled down Granville toward the theatre, watching the buskers,\
  \ dazzled by city lights.  On one trip, there was a man playing the guitar by a\
  \ storefront and I had beckoned my mother to stop and listen.  We had been standing\
  \ there all of sixty seconds when our next door neighbor from Bella Coola appeared.\
  \  \n\t\u201CI haven't seen you in a month!\u201D she said, hugging my mother. \
  \ They chatted for close to fifteen minutes before she managed to break away.  It\
  \ seconds, she had vanished again, lost in the sea of people.  As my mother turned\
  \ to leave I tugged on her arm and asked if we weren't going to give the man some\
  \ money.  \n\t\u201CThat was the last thing I was going to do after being so rude\
  \ and talking through his entire set,\u201D she said, handing me a five-dollar bill.\
  \  \u201CBut here, you do it.\u201D"
