Text: "At the time I was one of the official photographers of the World Superbike\
  \ championship in 2017. I am only equipped with a mirrorless camera and kit lens.\
  \ I can't take photos remotely like other photographers. It was a very hot day at\
  \ the Imola circuit, Italy. When Superbike will start racing, I ask one of the circuit\
  \ officers, where I can get the best photos with the lens that I have. He told me\
  \ to go to the last corner before the finish line, there is a chicane where the\
  \ drivers will go slow enough to be photographed dramatically. I go to the intended\
  \ corner, then I start preparing my camera. Among other photographers who have very\
  \ complete cameras, I take out my mirrorless camera. When the racer passed the corner\
  \ I took a photos and the results I got were photos of Nicky Hayden very dramatically\
  \ and I don\u2019t know why I like that picture very much. After a few days after\
  \ the Imola series, we all got the news that Nicky had an accident while cycling\
  \ in a rural area in Italy, and he was critical. Shortly, Nicky's announcement had\
  \ died, never expecting my photo at the last corner to be the last photo for Nicky\
  \ Hayden in the world of motorbike racing. Hope you calm down there Nicky, we all\
  \ miss you. Tribute to Nicky Hayden, The Texas Kid #69"
