Text: "\u201CThe mind is weak. The heart is a sell-out. Spirit is your only truth.\
  \ Never let it dampen,\u201D Thabani says with a smile while taking a peek at me\
  \ through the rear view mirror.\n\n\u201CI\u2019m going to write this down. This\
  \ is quote-worthy,\u201D I tell him while wiping my tears. \n\nA young man in his\
  \ early thirties, Thabani has been working as an Uber driver in Johannesburg for\
  \ three years now. He comes from the heart of KwaZulu-Natal. The Zulu tribe is the\
  \ largest ethnic group in South Africa. They are warriors who fought colonization\
  \ with more courage than guns. \n\nHe laughs. The uninhibited laughter of an innocent\
  \ kid.\n\n\u201CI am not educated like you sista but I know human beings. You are\
  \ a kind spirit. You cry not for your own pain but someone else\u2019s. Stay strong\
  \ neh. I know you Indian women are strong\u201D.\n\nHe unlocks the car for me.\n\
  \n\u201CThank you, my brother. Sharp Sharp (Goodbye)!\u201D\n\nAs I walk into the\
  \ gates of O.R. Tambo airport, I feel healed. It\u2019s heart-breaking to witness\
  \ casual racism. But I am glad I fought back for her. I hope she does so for herself\
  \ next time. Alright. It\u2019s time to focus on the presentation. I have fifteen\
  \ hours on the flight to New York. I am excited to go to my pilgrimage after the\
  \ meeting. The Lennon Memorial. Strawberry Fields will bring back the sweetness\
  \ of emotion I need right now. \n\n\u201CSo no one told you life was gonna be this\
  \ way. Cha Cha Cha,\u201D I am singing out loud in front of the Cherry Hill Fountain.\n\
  \ \nI am going around Central Park in a rickshaw driven by Nevaeh. I call him Neva.\n\
  \n\u201CYou\u2019re so funny. Where next?\u201D Neva asks.\n\n\u201CI don\u2019\
  t know. Let\u2019s see where the day takes me. This is the only place in the city\
  \ I really wanted to visit. I am not so interested in places. I am interested in\
  \ people. You know, I have been to Paris thrice now but never went up the Eiffel\
  \ Tower. I watched it light up at night from a distance while drinking wine with\
  \ Clara, the French friend I made there. I spoke to her through Google Translate.\
  \ You don\u2019t need to know the language to communicate anymore. Technology has\
  \ brought humanity closer. The world is a small place.\u201D\n\nNeva looks at me\
  \ with a smirk. I sense he doesn\u2019t believe me. \n\n\u201CWhat?!\u201D I don\u2019\
  t hide my displeasure.\n\n\u201CI\u2019m from Bronx. My mom is from Nigeria. I see\
  \ tourists every day. They say they travel y\u2019know. But they never come to ma\
  \ hood,\u201D he chuckles.\n\n\u201CI\u2019ll come.\u201D I shoot back, defensively.\n\
  \n\u201CHaha! Let\u2019s go to Ramble.\u201D\n\u201CI AM serious. Let\u2019s GO\
  \ to your hood!\u201D\n\u201CIt\u2019s an hour from here. And I have not done many\
  \ tours today. It\u2019s not season time. I earn by the day y\u2019know.\u201D \n\
  \nI take out my wallet and hand him a hundred dollars. He stares at me in disbelief.\
  \ \n\n\u201CLet\u2019s GO!!\u201D I repeat.\n\n\"Cool, lemme park the bike.\u201D\
  \n\nI google \u201CBronx\u201D while he is busy parking. \n\nWikipedia says it contains\
  \ the poorest congressional district in the United States. The South Bronx, particularly,\
  \ witnessed a wave of arson in the 70s and continues to be infamous for its high\
  \ crime areas. Inhabited mostly by Caribbean and African American migrants, it\u2019\
  s also a wellspring of hip hop and rock music. \n\nNeva is back. I book a cab. We\
  \ set out for an evening of adventure.\n\nIt\u2019s quarter past midnight. We are\
  \ sitting near the Bronx River drinking beer. A gang of four guys are speaking in\
  \ loud voices over the music of Slick Rick nearby. They are speaking so fast that\
  \ I understand nothing. While watching movies, I still have to look at the subtitles\
  \ to understand African American English.\n\nI look at Neva. He is a tall, muscular\
  \ guy. I notice he is quite handsome.\n\nHe stares back at me. Our eyes communicate\
  \ what we want to say. Our hearts, minds and spirits were together that night. We\
  \ had lived a world together the day before.\n\nWe pause. I can see his gaze move\
  \ from my eyes to my lips. And then, we lean in..."
