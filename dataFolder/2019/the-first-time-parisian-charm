Text: "Paris was my first international solo trip. I specifically chose Paris because\
  \ of the imagery and emotions it evoked in me. I pictured myself feeling peaceful\
  \ as I took long walks by the Seine, I was thrilled by the thought of visiting Shakespeare\
  \ and Company and I couldn\u2019t wait to be fascinated by the exhibits at the Louvre.\
  \ I had spent hours on the internet learning everything I could and as the trip\
  \ got closer my feelings varied from anxiety to excitement. I remember telling my\
  \ best friend on the phone, \u201CWhat if I get robbed or lost? You know I speak\
  \ very little French! How will I do this alone?\u201D\n\nOn day one, I planned to\
  \ visit Versailles, there was a metro station close to my Airbnb where a kind attendant\
  \ showed me the way to get there. It was fairly simple. I was humming a song and\
  \ happily trodding along when I saw an American family struggling with directions\
  \ to Versailles.\n\u201CHey guys! I\u2019m going to Versailles too. The attendant\
  \ told me that we need to take the 7th line to get there! \u201D\n\nPaul Matthews\
  \ introduced me to his wife and two delightful kids and asked me, \u201C Would you\
  \ be our guide?\u201D\n\n\u201CGladly.\u201D I grinned! \n\nAs we went along we\
  \ realized some trains were down for maintenance and we would have to follow a more\
  \ complicated route. Amidst all the confusion and the massive crowds the Matthews\
  \ chose to go their own way. At that time I felt a little scared, but I told myself\
  \ I was going to be okay. I walked to an attendant who explained the route to me\
  \ and also gave me a map. He told me,\u201C Be vary of the pickpockets!\u201D After\
  \ one bus and two train rides as I stood at the Versailles station, I felt  proud\
  \ of myself. I\u2019d never thought it would be possible for me to navigate somewhere\
  \ all by myself! Knowing that I could thrive in uncertainty was very empowering.\n\
  \nI felt a tender breeze as I walked towards the Palace of Versailles. Its vibrant\
  \ yellow color transcended me to a different time. 30 minutes later, I saw the Matthews\
  \ join the line. I waved to them, grinned a little and thought, if they\u2019d have\
  \ stuck with me they\u2019d have been there sooner. \n\n\nOn this trip I had dragged\
  \ 2 heavy bags for 3 kilometers to reach my Airbnb, used Bonjour! and my big smile\
  \ to get directions and go around the city (and sometimes still took the wrong trains).Through\
  \ the next few days I spent a lot of time learning about the French Culture and\
  \ history.I felt my childhood memories come back to me at Notre Dam! The guide on\
  \ a walking tour showed us where Picasso dined, took us through narrow alleyways\
  \ showing us some amazing street art and told us many local stories from Paris.\
  \ On another day, in Montmartre, the artistic district of Paris, someone I met on\
  \ the road said to me, \u201C This is where Van Gogh lived.\u201D I stood there\
  \ for 10 minutes admiring his grit and his love for his work. The stories, the art,\
  \ they gave me a sense of fulfillment and joy I couldn\u2019t explain. You know\
  \ how you feel after a really good conversation? Exactly that feeling!. \n\n\nI\
  \ spent my afternoons at museums and coffee shops, enjoying the quintessential Parisian\
  \ summer. My evenings were spent in various parks and on long walks at the Champs-\xC9\
  lys\xE9es. Every night, I wrote about different aspects of this journey. I took\
  \ a lot of time to introspect and discover myself. I had done things that I had\
  \ never done before and was feeling very content. On my last evening in Paris, I\
  \ sat in Trocadero Park waiting for the Eiffel to light up and thought to myself,\
  \ a month ago, I\u2019d never have thought it was okay to sit in silence, eat by\
  \ myself, talk to so many strangers or survive in an unknown city all by myself!\
  \ I did all those things and more!I felt confident, comfortable and independent!\
  \ And just when the Eiffel lit up, my soul did too!"
