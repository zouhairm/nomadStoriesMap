Text: "I took a deep breath.\n\nSucking in my drug of choice.\n\nAs I exhaled, I could\
  \ feel my mind expanding. New possibilities, new ideas, shimmered throughout my\
  \ imagination like a million brilliant stars. I felt peace creeping over me, a deep\
  \ peace that I had never felt before. Some may call it a spiritual awakening, something\
  \ written of in ancient books of wisdom. Others may simply call it the moment when\
  \ I finally found myself\u2026outside without my smartphone.\n\nBreathing in fresh\
  \ cool air, looking out at the expanse of a valley glowing with the natural wonder\
  \ of a forest teaming with wildlife. Across from where I sat a silver stream flowed\
  \ down the mountainside, a tiny ribbon bursting into a waterfall as it neared the\
  \ bottom of the valley. A waterfall pouring life into the lake below as light from\
  \ a full moon caressed every ripple.\n\nStrangely enough, I wouldn\u2019t exchange\
  \ this experience for yet another evening in a seedy apartment, slumped on a couch\
  \ infested with bed bugs, smoking up and watching the empty babble streaming from\
  \ the television.\n\nSure, going downhill is easier\u2026much easier\u2026but no\
  \ matter how easy it is, it doesn\u2019t get you to the top of the mountain\u2026\
  and let me tell you, the view from here is a whole lot better than you\u2019ll ever\
  \ get if you spend your evenings wallowing around with bottom feeders\u2026\n\n\
  So, even though the climb may be difficult right now\u2026keep on struggling\u2026\
  keep on climbing when everyone else is content to remain sitting\u2026I know you\
  \ can do it\u2026and in the end, it\u2019ll be worth it\u2026trust me\u2026"
