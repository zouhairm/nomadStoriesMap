Text: "Orange / Red / Violet, they are colors that hypnotize you in the sky and on\
  \ the mountains of the beautiful land of Camarones, in the Argentine Patagonia.\
  \ Charming town that I had the pleasure of visiting six months ago, as a surveyor\
  \ to design a social study in field and that thanks to its diversity of landscapes,\
  \ aroused my fascination, for all that I witnessed around me.\n\nMy professional\
  \ intention was to know the socioeconomic conditions of its inhabitants; as a classic\
  \ tourist enjoy watching penguins and whales. However to my surprise, I, Anita,\
  \ the ordinary human being and current, lover of concrete jungles, the cosmopolitan\
  \ things, was there in the middle of everything and nothing, discovering a new love,\
  \ for the unspoilt nature, without theme parks, with ancestral geology, changing\
  \ flora, amazing fauna and captivating food, without skyscrapers, funky music or\
  \ famous hotels, shops or restaurants.\n\nThe color palette over the sky and the\
  \ marriage of the moon and the sun telling good morning and see you  later each\
  \ other should be in my heart and my mind always. Also amazed, with the possibility\
  \ of interacting without fear with the guanacos and the sheep with much less grazing,\
  \ these animals made me jump for joy inside the car like a 9 year old girl, as well,\
  \ in my delirium of love that even they posed for the million photos I took of the\
  \ poor, incessantly.\n\nThe sense of peace that gives you the silence of an inhospitable\
  \ community has no price, the roller coaster of sensations and emotions of happiness,\
  \ peace, nostalgia, fear and freedom that you get when you look up and witness so\
  \ much nature around you is indescribable. Also it is the supreme satisfaction of\
  \ a foodie like me, to feel in an episode of any food reality show where you get\
  \ paid to delight you with delicious meals.\n\nAbove all, for me, venezuelan, citizen\
  \ of the world, for now resident in Buenos Aires, who although enjoy any tasty asado\
  \ argentino, has to be loyal to her Caribbean root of enjoy even more the luxury\
  \ of eating for almost a week, sea food. Including the most delicious dishes of\
  \ shrimp of all my life and the pleasure of receiving the kindness of Patricia and\
  \ Betty, unsurpassed cooks, some geniuses, without international chef's degree,\
  \ using a few local ingredients, sometimes like any great cook, even without being\
  \ inside the menu, they dared to fulfill my requests.\n\nNor will I forget Martina,\
  \ acting student and Gabriel, historian of heart, them, my fellow surveyors, intelligent,\
  \ advocates of inclusive language with much responsibility and respect.\n\nSimples\
  \ guys, with a self-knowledge and a sense of respect for others, kind people, with\
  \ particulars occurrences like few and annoying too a few times. They, with their\
  \ typical dare as millennial told me that I was like a story character, which far\
  \ from offending me fascinated me. I felt that was a compliment because I sincerely\
  \ think that they had a lot of fun with some of my healthy manias, routines and\
  \ my peculiar comments about my extreme passion for tennis and my boyfriend Roger\
  \ Federer, my vision of adult life and my ideas to deal with to conquer the world\
  \ as Pinky and Brain and not dying trying unless it's eating the last dinner.\n\
  \ \nHonestly beyond the pressure of work every day was very instructive for me,\
  \ the saying \"There is always a first time for everything\" was fulfilled thousands\
  \ of times in less than a week, I still marvel writing, so much so that my hair\
  \ stops remember the indigo blue of the sea like an oil crayon, some small islands\
  \ in the middle of it, the beautiful valleys and the purification of soul that you\
  \ experience every time the 40km / h be breeze hit your legs and face and not I\
  \ cared even When I was ruffled, I was unleashed a storm of indescribable sensations,\
  \ there was an immense emotion to receive a thing that felt so pure and unique in\
  \ Camarones that for sure unforgettably will live in my mind and heart forever."
