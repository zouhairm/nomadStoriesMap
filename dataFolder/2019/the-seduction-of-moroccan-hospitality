Text: "The scent of orange blossom perfumed the air outside the airport as our lovely\
  \ driver showed us to our car. On the short ride to our riad, in the midst of exchanging\
  \ pleasantries, he looked up at us in the rear-view mirror and said: \u201CWelcome\
  \ to Marrakech\u201D. His sincerity enveloped me like a warm hug. \n\nWhen the car\
  \ could no longer navigate the narrowing paths, a porter promptly met us at one\
  \ of the side streets. The enthusiastic old man refused our help and insisted he\
  \ carry our heavy bags to our room. It hit me then, before even stepping foot in\
  \ our riad, that Moroccan hospitality was unlike any other. \n\nWe were promptly\
  \ greeted and offered mint tea and cookies, and given all the information we would\
  \ need during our stay. The cinnamon scented living room was lavishly decorated,\
  \ illuminated by candlelight. Was this a dream? \n\nWe spent days exploring the\
  \ Medina, trying to take in everything that was swirling around us. Marrakech was\
  \ most definitely alive. The vendors animated, the offerings, tempting. It took\
  \ about 10 seconds to assess the row of olive vendors to determine which one was\
  \ the favorite, and then 10 minutes to devour nearly the entire bag we purchased.\
  \ \n\nLa Maison de la Photographie, a beautiful riad turned photo gallery, was a\
  \ notable stop. The black and white stills told stories of gorgeous Moroccans from\
  \ various eras and backgrounds. I was falling in love with these people with every\
  \ portrait that graced my sight. When we reached the top of the riad for a look\
  \ at the view, the afternoon call to prayer began echoing through the streets, lulling\
  \ me into an almost trance-like state of gratitude. \n\nWe trekked well beyond Jemaa\
  \ el-Fna square to the stunning Jardin Majorelle, the resting place of its late\
  \ owner Yves St-Laurent. The garden itself was designed by painter Jacques Majorelle,\
  \ whose name is now synonymous with the shade of blue that adorns the garden compound.\
  \ The most striking shade of blue I have ever seen.\n\nPalaces, tombs, Mosques,\
  \ souks, there was something to discover at every turn. Taxis, motorbikes, pedestrians,\
  \ horses, and tiny cats seemed to coexist in a sort of organized chaos.\n\nThe riad\
  \ became our oasis, away from the heat and dirt of the outdoors. The food there\
  \ was delicious, and the homecooked feel of each meal was the reason we opted to\
  \ eat there most often. Chicken and olive with preserved lemons, Berber vegetable,\
  \ and beef tagines simmered with prunes, were always enjoyed with delicious Moroccan\
  \ bread. Each meal was served on the lovely rooftop patio that became my happy place.\
  \ Up there, an overwhelming sense of happiness and calm washed over me. \n\nBreakfast\
  \ was my favorite time of day. The fresh morning air, sunshine, and peaceful surroundings\
  \ created the perfect setting for the daily offering of yogurt, orange juice, tea,\
  \ fruit, pastries, and warm bread served up with butter and jam. Thinking about\
  \ it makes me smile.\n\nWe decided to stay out of the heat on our last day and enjoy\
  \ everything the riad had to offer, including one of their spa packages. A Turkish\
  \ bath, massage, and a delicious lunch on the patio sounded like just the ticket.\
  \ \n\nI was not mentally prepared for what the Turkish bath entailed. The scrubbing\
  \ and the buckets of water thrown at me quickly killed the romanticized idea in\
  \ my head.  It was immensely comical, and only partially terrifying. Luckily, the\
  \ massage erased most of the emotional scars incurred and the lunch, as predicted,\
  \ was lovely.\n\nOn our last night, we had a romantic dinner at a modern Moroccan\
  \ restaurant called Nomad. Their couscous was stunning and the date cake even better.\
  \ Another gorgeous rooftop patio with a view of the square, beautiful d\xE9cor,\
  \ luxurious cushions, and ample candlelight. The people of Marrakech had clearly\
  \ mastered the art of \u2018ambience\u2019.\n\nWe left the next morning to catch\
  \ our flight to Rome. True to the hospitality we\u2019d come to know, our hosts\
  \ insisted on preparing a special and early (6:30 am early), breakfast for us before\
  \ we left. I slathered my bread with butter and jam, slowly sipped my tea, one last\
  \ time, in my happy place."
