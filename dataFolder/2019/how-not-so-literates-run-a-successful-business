Text: "No matter how globalized our country gets, home cooked food has always been\
  \ a priority in India. However, in today\u2019s tightly packed work schedules, cooking\
  \ food early in the morning before going to work can be a little torturous. In a\
  \ city like Mumbai, also known as the city that never sleeps, around 7.5 million\
  \ people travel by the local trains every day, making the trains jam-packed and\
  \ carrying tiffin boxes along with seems like an impossible job.\nGopirao Shinde,\
  \ is a \u2018Dabbawala\u2019 in Mumbai. Just like his other 5,000 colleagues, his\
  \ job is to pick up fresh, home-cooked food from homes in the morning and deliver\
  \ it to their respective owners in offices safely by lunch time. They are all dressed\
  \ in white and wear a white cap that makes them stand out from the crowd. The sun\
  \ is scorching bright, and humidity is at it\u2019s peak in Mumbai. Shinde is all\
  \ set for his journey of six hours. He starts his morning on his bicycle and picks\
  \ up tiffin boxes with home-made food from his assigned houses. His schedule is\
  \ tightly packed; therefore, he cannot afford losing even a minute of his time.\
  \ The customers are also aware of this. They respect the Dabbawalas and keep their\
  \ boxes ready before their arrival. The Dabbawalas depend on each other in the whole\
  \ process. This process is almost like a relay race, where even if one person gets\
  \ delayed, the others lose. There is no chance they\u2019ll let their community\
  \ down. This is the reason that the Dabbawalas have such a strong sense of teamwork\
  \ and responsibility. (A life lesson that we could all adhere to in our daily lives).\
  \ Given Mumbai\u2019s weather, there have been times when the city suffered from\
  \ heavy rainfalls and even floods. But their strong sense of integrity towards work,\
  \ kept the Dabbawalas going. \nShinde then reaches Church Gate Station where all\
  \ the Dabbawalas meet and divide their boxes according to where they have to be\
  \ delivered. The Church Gate Station is overflowing with daily commuters and the\
  \ Dabbawalas. Each Dabbawala is responsible for as many as 50 tiffins. The whole\
  \ scenario seems like a big chaos where everybody\u2019s in a rush to reach their\
  \ respective places. Yet it is all such a beauty to watch. You can observe them\
  \ from a distance as they rarely have time to entertain anyone or answer any of\
  \ your questions. Shinde was humble enough to acknowledge me with the system and\
  \ give some insights. He said that their religion teaches them that food is a blessing\
  \ and has to be valued and should not be wasted or mistreated in any way. I took\
  \ a corner and just gazed at the crowd, how people have no time to stop, how the\
  \ Dabbawalas are so dedicated and engrossed in their work, that they don\u2019t\
  \ care about the crowded station, the traffic or even the extensive humid weather.\
  \ Gopirao Shinde is busy segregating lunch boxes according to a coding system that\
  \ all the Dabbawalas follow. This coding system is unique yet understandable by\
  \ the Dabbawalas, who have an average literacy of upto 8th grade. The Dabbawalas\
  \ then set out to deliver the tiffin boxes before lunch time. Their duty is also\
  \ to collect the boxes after lunch, and deliver them back to their respective homes.\
  \ \nOne might think this entirely human driven system is likely to make mistakes\
  \ when there are such large numbers of transactions involved, roughly more than\
  \ 2 lakh every day, when the boxes change hands nearly five times before they reach\
  \ their owner; but their system is so precise and strong, that the Dabbawalas have\
  \ gained a six sigma rating, which means the error ratio is one in six millions.\
  \ Their strong ethics and discipline towards their work has made them one of the\
  \ most successful businesses in the world. Unlike today\u2019s multinational companies\
  \ that primarily depend on technology, the Dabbawalas are here to prove that you\
  \ don\u2019t necessarily need a number of degrees or diplomas to run a successful\
  \ business and that consistent dedication and discipline towards one\u2019s work\
  \ will always give results that you thrive for."
