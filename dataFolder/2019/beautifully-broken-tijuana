Text: "Have you ever thought of going to Tijuana for pleasure? Unless you are a Californian\
  \ American Citizen looking for cheap drugs, chances are you haven\u2019t. When I\
  \ came back from that business trip to Tijuana, none of the people I talked to showed\
  \ any excitement about this city I found so fascinating. \nI don't blame them. The\
  \ first time I went there, I didn't want to leave my hotel bedroom either. Or perhaps\
  \ I wanted to, but did not feel brave enough for doing so. Tijuana is, as most people\
  \ know, one of the deadliest cities in M\xE9xico. As I was talking to my temporary\
  \ students about Tijuana's murder rate, I felt the anxiety and excitement for exploring\
  \ the city gradually leaving my body. \nTijuana is a wounded city. I felt it in\
  \ the paranoia of its inhabitants in my morning walks through the beach. I felt\
  \ it when, in broad daylight,  of the locals asked me if I was sure I wanted to\
  \ go downtown by myself. I felt it when I was waiting for an Uber in the street\
  \ and people were anxiously asking me when would it arrive. Tijuana is a broken\
  \ city and this story wouldn\u2019t be complete without addressing the wounds of\
  \ a city that has been so deeply hurt by cartel violence.  Like all broken things,\
  \ Tijuana carries the stunning beauty of those who have survived pain. Tijuana is\
  \ a city that has gone through too much, but despite, or because of, this is a city\
  \ that refuses to die and chooses to survive with much dignity instead. \n\nThe\
  \ second time I was in Tijuana was different. Ever since I got there I promised\
  \ myself I wouldn\u2019t at least let Tijuana show me what it had to offer. Once\
  \ my job duties where done, some of my students offered to take me eat ceviche (seafood\
  \ in Baja California is known to be glorious), or at least that was the plan. When\
  \ we were at Tijuana\u2019s eclectic downtown they decided they would show to me\
  \ some of the city's oldest places first. We walk through some of the city's markets.\
  \ Old neglected buildings that used to be crowded with souvenirs shops. \n\nThe\
  \ souvenirs shops were there for the Americans (known in Mexico as gringos) that\
  \ would come to Mexico looking for a type of freedom that the land of the free did\
  \ not offer. During alcohol prohibition times, Tijuana was, by excellence, the party\
  \ destination of Californians. It is often said that during the twenties, the world\u2019\
  s largest bar was in Tijuana, a city that was only starting to arise. Wet shirts,\
  \ alcohol and drugs were everyday on Tijuana\u2019s streets in the good old days.\u201C\
  And then what happened?\u201D, I asked Cristina, \u201C09/11 and the war on drugs\
  \ happened\u201D, she replied. \n\nAfter 2001 and after violence escalated, the\
  \ city that used to be California\u2019s favorite party stop, saw a decline in tourism\
  \ that it's inhabitants resented. Those old buildings crowded with souvenirs shops\
  \ were abandoned and it was not until recently that artists and other independent\
  \ groups started recovering and resignifying. Tijuana\u2019s old markets. Those\
  \ places that used to be live of spring breakers and gringo\u2019s partying are\
  \ now spaces for alternative culture, for art and resistance. \u201CI like it better\
  \ this way\u201D, Axel said when we left the first market we went to. They then\
  \ took me to brewery shops for alternative beer and to rustic cantinees for normal\
  \ beer. We eventually did find an American guy that was looking for cheap cocaine.\
  \ \u201CI hate gringos coming to my town for drugs, but also love it. Here anything\
  \ can happen\u201D, Cristina said. We went to rustic canteens with dirty bathrooms\
  \ and ugly decoration, the cebiche never arrived, but I still loved it. It all felt\
  \ so real. \n\nIn the era of instagram pictures and fake smiles, Tijuana is a perfect\
  \ expose of why the\u201Ccounter culture\u201D movement has been so successful.\
  \ Perhaps Tijuana will be saved by those hipsters that state rustic, old fashioned,\
  \ broken, anti touristy stuff is also beautiful and exciting. The \u201Canti touristy\u201D\
  \ movement has it\u2019s problems, but it might still offer to us new ways of seeing\
  \ the world we live in."
