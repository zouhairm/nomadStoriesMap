Text: "Samba. Beautiful girls dancing. They are covered with colorful feathers and\
  \ their bodies are painted with glitter. Everybody is drinking beer and cacha\xE7\
  a. Singing and laughing. A typical image of brazilian carnival and i do not disagree\
  \ with that. This is true in some parts of our continental country.\nThe best part\
  \ of living in a continental country,  full of different cultures,  is that you\
  \ can  always be surprised with something new. A new meal that you never tried before.\
  \ Maybe a new landscape that you\u2019ve  never seen. Even a new word, which you\
  \ did not know because you live in another region.\nThis year, i was invited to\
  \ spend the carnival holidays in a small town in the mountains. And i accepted,\
  \ not expecting much. But i would be with some friends, so it sounded  good.\nI\u2019\
  am a \u201Cbeach\u201D girl, even if I only go to the beach once or twice a year.\
  \ The beach is always available and close to me. And I got used to the warm and\
  \ sunny weather. Some people may say that I live in paradise. But paradise is not\
  \ that paradisiac when you live in it all year long. You start begging for a little\
  \ cold, a little mist  or a little bit of rain. Just to change the scenario and\
  \ be capable to see a different kind of beauty.\nAll I knew about this small town\
  \ is that there would be a Jazz & Blues Festival.  There would be cold and i could\
  \ finally drink some hot chocolate. Its name is Guaramiranga, but we can call just\
  \ \u201CGuara\u201D.  Etymologically, it comes from the Tupi language (an  indigenous\
  \ language), where Guara means \u201Cred\u201D and Miranga means \u201Cbird\u201D\
  . Red Bird.\nI spent five days in Guara. The first four days were nice, but predictable.\
  \ I watched the festival\u2019s shows, drank hot chocolate, sang a lot, drank more\
  \ hot chocolate (and a little wine, because i deserve). The Jazz&Blues Festival\
  \ is the highlight of the year in Guara, it\u2019s when the town gets full of tourists.\
  \ As i said before, it\u2019s really small town. It has a main street, with a small\
  \ square, an unfinished theatre, some restaurants, a pub and that\u2019s it.\nDuring\
  \ the last day, it was just me and two of my friends. The rest of them left the\
  \ town before, just like almost all the tourists. Now there was a more lonely aura.\
  \  And it rained a lot, which may helped me to have this feeling. A complete clich\xE9\
  , but still true.\nThe night came. I had dinner with my friends and we were planning\
  \ to lie down earlier that night, because we would be leaving town next morning.\
  \ So we went down the main street to get to our lodging. When we were passing in\
  \ front of the unfinished theatre, we saw a group of young hippies. They were playing\
  \ guitar and singing. Their good vibes just catched us and we joined them. We started\
  \ singing and i felt so happy. But then, some police officers came to us and said\
  \ we must stop playing and singing in the middle of the street. One of the hippies,\
  \ a guy with a bir curly hair, tried to argue with the cops. We were not doing anything\
  \ wrong and we all knew that, but the cops were getting angry, so we gave up.\n\
  And it started to rain a lot. Oh damn. The fun is definetly over, i thought. Suddenly,\
  \ the guys of the group just started running in the rain. They were laughing and\
  \ singing something i can\u2019t remember. But i did a soundtrack in my mind. My\
  \ brain decided to play Age of Aquarius, from the musical Hair (1967).\nI just could\u2019\
  t stop smiling at them, running like children. They seemed so free. Now i see that\
  \ they really got the spirit of Guara, which is a spirit of freedom and contact\
  \ with nature. And i\u2019m so glad that i had the opportunity to find beauty in\
  \ this unconventional place, in this unconventional people."
