Text: "Looking back, it was a crazy shot in the dark, a search for a needle in the\
  \ great haystack of English history. It started with fifty-year-old letters written\
  \ during WWII by a British seaman in the Merchant Navy to a woman in America, the\
  \ great-aunt of a dear friend of mine. Like lovers in an Andrews Sisters song, a\
  \ wartime relationship had bloomed, but was snipped short when he had to leave,\
  \ and eventually, his letters stopped coming. Somehow she was able to find out he\
  \ had been killed, but since she was not related by blood or marriage, she had no\
  \ other information. The sailor was dead; that much we knew. But when? How? What\
  \ about his family?\nWhen my friend told me all of this, he and I were in college,\
  \ just beginning a study abroad program in London. His great-aunt had given him\
  \ some of the letters and they showed that the sailor was from a small town not\
  \ far from London. He wanted to visit the town and perhaps bring home some closure\
  \ to his aunt. Of course I could come along. \nAt the time, the internet barely\
  \ existed outside of the government and university worlds. There were no genealogy\
  \ websites, no Google, no GPS. So, without a map, guidebook or a real plan, one\
  \ Saturday morning we boarded a train to a village called Stanford-le-Hope. The\
  \ irony of the town\u2019s name struck us later\u2014after all these years, what\
  \ did we have working in our favor except hope? \nThe town itself was our first\
  \ surprise. There was a High Street and a church, and buildings covered with ivy,\
  \ but from reading the sailor\u2019s letters, we had imagined it would still exist\
  \ in pre-war black and white, and we just couldn\u2019t visualize it. \nWe started\
  \ walking toward the church, an 800-year-old beauty with the quintessentially British\
  \ name of St. Margaret\u2019s. This was surely the part in our quest when an elderly\
  \ vicar would appear and guide us to a well-tended gravestone where we could pay\
  \ our respects. But no one was at the church. This town was not cooperating.\nDisillusioned,\
  \ we decided to walk around a little more before catching the train back to London.\
  \ At this point we were pretty aimless, for the letters we were carrying around\
  \ didn\u2019t even have a proper address, just a cottage name (something about lambs)\
  \ and no number. Not that a street address would have helped, since we still hadn\u2019\
  t bothered to find a town map.\nNonetheless, we turned down a residential street,\
  \ and it was there that we saw her--a woman about the age of our grandmothers. Using\
  \ our best manners, we approached her and asked if she had a moment to talk to us.\
  \ Yes, she did. Had she lived in Stanford-le-Hope for a long time? Yes, her whole\
  \ life. We told her who we were and what we were doing, and my friend pulled the\
  \ letters out of his backpack. Did she remember this family who lived here in the\
  \ 1930\u2019s and 40\u2019s? She squinted at the faded fountain pen ink on the envelope.\
  \ She looked up at us. Of course she did. She had been very close to the mother.\
  \ \n She confirmed what we already knew. Yes, she had known the sailor, and yes,\
  \ he was lovely. Yes, he was dead. Her voice made it a little easier to hear, but\
  \ it still broke our hearts when she told us he had been killed when his ship hit\
  \ a mine near the mouth of the Thames within weeks of the war ending. \nShe gave\
  \ us a few more details; the sailor had been born in Australia and was buried there,\
  \ which explained why we hadn\u2019t found a tombstone at St. Margaret\u2019s. She\
  \ didn\u2019t believe there was any family still in the area. \nOver 25 years later,\
  \ the poignancy of this story still pulls at my heart. We are always living through\
  \ history, even though we rarely realize it at the time. If you have any doubts\
  \ as to the complexity of the web that holds us together, just say hello to a little\
  \ old woman walking down a street in the town of Stanford-le-Hope."
