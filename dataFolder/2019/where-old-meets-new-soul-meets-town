Text: "When I was younger, I had the dream to know as many places as possible. Unfortunately,\
  \ I come from a country when opportunities are hard to get. But at some point of\
  \ my life, the efforts of my parents have resulted in an one month trip to anyplace\
  \ in world. And so, there I was, on my way to London, UK.\nI wasn\u2019t one of\
  \ those people who were crazy about there.. until I\u2019ve been there. At the very\
  \ moment I step my foot out of the Heathrow Airport, I knew it was something about\
  \ that place... Something different in the air, the smell of the fog and the city\
  \ noises. I felt so connected with this city, that I had the most pleasing moments\
  \ just walking by the Westminster Bridge, seeing people with their guitars singing\
  \ right across the Thames river, singing with their violins down in the South Kensington\
  \ station, or people eating fish and chips in South Bank. \nMaybe, I identified\
  \ myself with the city and its excitement, noisy and busy lifestyle because I could\
  \ see the anxiety I felt - like there was always something about to happen - in\
  \ the city too. I personally thought myself also as a young person with an old soul.\
  \ And that\u2019s how London is. Aside all those modern and high buildings, there\
  \ are old places with stories that go far from our imagination and a few words will\
  \ never be able to tell. \n There is the modern world and the old world, and in\
  \ London they coexist, resulting in the most complex, fabulous and addicting city\
  \ of all time. \nI use to think that I was all alone in the world, but until I\u2019\
  ve been there, I am quite aware that there are some places one belongs to, and therefore,\
  \ one is never alone.\nAlmost like in the Red Hot Chilli Pepper song that said \u201C\
  Sometimes I feel like my only friend is the city I live in\u201D. \nThank you, London,\
  \ for not letting me feel alone, for letting me feel alive."
