Text: "\u201CPiazalle Roma\u201D stated the black and yellow sign. I had just arrived\
  \ into Venice late at night and was desperately hunting for the vaporetto (water\
  \ taxi) stop that I needed to catch to take me to the nearby island of Guidecca,\
  \ where my hostel was situated. \n\nUnfortunately, I had turned up during a 24-hour\
  \ vaporetto strike. \n\nTired, hungry and irritable, I looked around for a member\
  \ of staff to find out when the next boat would be, however there was no one around.\
  \ \n\n20 minutes later, after an awkward, loosely Italian based conversation with\
  \ a member of the local Polizia, I found out that I would have to wait an hour or\
  \ so for the next vaporetto to appear. \n\nAfter waiting on a floating platform\
  \ that was designated as the waiting area, the boat finally arrived and we slowly\
  \ drifted along the canal ways of Venice to my destination. \n\nThe next morning,\
  \ I rose early and walked out to discover Venice in the daylight.  \n\nGuidecca\
  \ is the one of the largest islands off of Venice, providing a quiet serenity away\
  \ from the hordes of crowds on the main island. I strolled along the island\u2019\
  s promenade soaking in the Venetian atmosphere, while devouring a number of pastries\
  \ I had bought from the local market. \n\nI spent the rest of the day getting lost\
  \ in the back streets of Venice, stopping often to people watch from a caf\xE9 with\
  \ an Aperol Spritz, or two, in hand. \n\nAt some point unbeknownst, I had arrived\
  \ at the Rialto Bridge, that sat proudly over the Grand Canal. I pushed my way through\
  \ the crowds and sought a spot near the top of the bridge, so I could get the best\
  \ view. Looking out from the peak of Rialto Bridge, I could see a mixture of gondolas\
  \ and vaporetto's navigating the canal ways, while the canals themselves were lined\
  \ with exquisitely decorated buildings spanning numerous time periods. \n\nIt was\
  \ a moment to savour, so I stayed put and absorbed as much of the atmosphere as\
  \ possible, until a craving for gelato lead my mind astray. \n\nMinutes later, with\
  \ a tub of gelato in hand I continued my foray around the city until further hunger\
  \ set in and I took the vaporetto back to the island of Giudecca, in search of some\
  \ local cuisine I.e. pizza and wine. \n\nThe next day I set off again early, hoping\
  \ to see the parts of the city that I had not been able to visit the day before.\
  \ \n\nHowever, overnight the tides had risen so high that a large portion Venice\
  \ was flooded. \n\nSan Marco square was now a paddling pool for the local wildlife,\
  \ while the hordes of tourists were forced to walk the wooden benches that lined\
  \ the inside perimeter of the square and basilica. \n\nIt seemed that the throngs\
  \ of people could be easily separated into locals versus tourists, dependent on\
  \ the footwear they were sporting in this weather: the locals were well prepared\
  \ with their knee-high wellington boots, while the tourists were either sporting\
  \ luminous, plastic shoe covers or bravely hopping through the flooded streets barefoot.\
  \ I opted to join the tourists and ended up with a pair of overpriced bright, blue\
  \ waders to keep my feet dry while I continued to explore. \n\nThe floods may have\
  \ spread throughout the entire city, but the spirit of the crowd was far from dampened.\
  \ Everywhere I went, people were smiling as they casually waded through the floods\
  \ as if this was a part of their everyday activity and not actually the signs of\
  \ a city sinking into the sea. \n\nLater that day I was due to depart for Verona;\
  \ the next stop on my Italian adventure. \n\nVenice had originally overwhelmed me\
  \ in several ways: as I had arrived at the height of a public transport strike and\
  \ then awakened the next day to discover the city had flooded overnight. Nonetheless,\
  \ I had now become enchanted by this city and did not want to leave so soon. As\
  \ I boarded my bus to Verona, I looked back at this floating metropolis and knew\
  \ that I would be back to wade it\u2019s streets again."
