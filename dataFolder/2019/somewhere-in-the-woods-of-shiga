Text: "It was hot in Kyoto. The platform of the central station was crowded with people,\
  \ mostly tourists, like me. August 11 was one of those days where the sunshine seemed\
  \ to be coming from more than one direction and cast everything in a surreal light.\
  \ The message only said: Come to Adogawa Station at 3pm. There would be a party\
  \ in the forest of Shiga with live music, food, booze, and a hundred people, some\
  \ friends of the host, some strangers like me. The departure board showed the new\
  \ time of the Kosei line, one minute to go. Maybe this is what mothers really mean\
  \ when they say \u2018don\u2019t get into cars with strangers\u2019: Don\u2019t\
  \ go to a house in the woods when you have been lured there by a thread on the internet.\
  \ But there would be people there. And music. There was only one train from Kyoto\
  \ to Adogawa that afternoon and it was entering the station now.\n\nThe woods were\
  \ cooler than the streets of Kyoto and all the other places I had been to that summer,\
  \ but not chilly like the airconditioned convenience stores. The wind felt breezy\
  \ and refreshing against my skin. The air was swarming with mosquitoes who were,\
  \ unlike their city cousins, immune to the insect spray I had taken to dousing myself\
  \ with every couple of hours. But it did not seem to bother anyone else. The clearing\
  \ in front of the traditional Japanese house was alive with activity. Elderly women\
  \ in kimonos were arranging cold tofu and dumplings on a buffet table, little children\
  \ were running between their legs. As soon as I had arrived at the house with three\
  \ backpackers, who likewise did not listen to their mothers, the beaming host had\
  \ introduced us to his aunt, sister, and the elderly ladies, and before we knew\
  \ it, we had each consumed four little cups of rice wine. On the veranda musicians\
  \ were tuning their instruments, two acoustic guitars, and a pear-shaped lute like\
  \ the ones Geishas play in paintings. It is called a Biwa, the sister informed.\
  \ I heard a blonde woman next to me talk about a restaurant opening in Madrid. The\
  \ sun was setting behind the black treetops, and the host\u2019s cousins ignited\
  \ a bundle of branches in the middle of the clearing. By now everyone had partaken\
  \ in the sake and beer that was passed around and the atmosphere was charged with\
  \ anticipation. Two young girls, both dressed in colourful Yukata, stepped near\
  \ the fire. When they raised their bamboo flutes to their lips the conversations\
  \ died down to a whisper. The sweet, sharp tune transformed the girl\u2019s faces.\
  \ The old Japanese gentlemen next to me gently closed his eyes and swayed his head\
  \ from left to right. Darkness had descended on the clearing. The only illumination\
  \ came from the cackling flames and some paper lamps hung between branches. Suddenly\
  \ the rhythmic pounding of drums joined the melody. Some people got up from the\
  \ floor and started dancing. There were a hundred people in the Shiga woods that\
  \ night. Not one too few, not one too many. There were one hundred bodies moving\
  \ to one rhythm. The sound of the drums reverberated through the forest, a warning\
  \ to evil spirits lurking in the shadows of the trees. \n\n \u2018We tell ourselves\
  \ stories in order to live\u2019 wrote Joan Didion. We also tell ourselves stories\
  \ in order to live them, to carry them with us, to share them with others. This\
  \ is the story I think about most often now. In my mind I was there. I see the Shiga\
  \ woods as clearly as the light on the platform that afternoon. I wonder if next\
  \ time I will get on the train."
