Text: "\u2018Everyone, please get out of the lounge to the open area outside leaving\
  \ your carry on\u2019, one of the flight attendants came rushing from the other\
  \ end of the terminal. I was one step away from buying the famous Belgium chocolates\
  \ in the Duty-free shop in the Zaventem Airport Brussels. I was about to sneak but\
  \ seeing the sudden unrest enveloping in the airport, pulled myself out of my chocolate\
  \ world. \n\u2018Airport is under attacked by terrorists. Please get outside! \u2018\
  - one of the staffs announced loudly in scared voice. \nI ran outside along with\
  \ other passengers. A busy, vibrant airport had turned into a war zone. I was looking\
  \ around to observe the people not knowing how to react. I saw a young couple crying\
  \ ang hugging each other tight. \u2018Mom, I am safe. I miss you\u2019 a beautiful\
  \ girl with teary eyes relives her mom on phone. I could see the tears and fear\
  \ in the eyes of people. I don\u2019t know if it was the cold or the fear that I\
  \ was shivering inside quite a lot. \nThen an army shuttle came to drop us outside\
  \ the airport where thousands of passengers were left stranded. I was very much\
  \ suffocated in the crowd and the whole situation so decided to take a small walk\
  \ little away from the crowd and happened to see the front part of the airport where\
  \ the bombing had occurred. I could not approach closer as it was all sealed and\
  \ many policemen, army and journalists were covering the area. I couldn\u2019t believe\
  \ my eyes and that\u2019s when I reckon it felt the shock deep inside. \u2018Damn,\
  \ I missed my flight to USA and I don\u2019t know when I will reach?\u2019 What\
  \ a start of the trip to a different continent. \n\n Ambulances were running back\
  \ and forth. Blood stains and shattered glass, wounded people are all I could see.\
  \ I thought it\u2019s better to avoid the area.  While walking back, I saw a young\
  \ girl yelling loud and crying with her friends. I went close to listen and realized\
  \ she lost her close friends who had planned a random trip to visit Belgium on her\
  \ insistence. She was waiting outside in a cafe while her friends were coming out\
  \ of the airport but all he heard was the blast and nothing else. \nAfter couple\
  \ of hours waiting in the cold, we were taken to the air hanger. I took the shelter\
  \ along with some of the fellow passengers who were also in transit and heading\
  \ to the same destination. I was somewhat frustrated with having to go through as\
  \ if I have been cursed during the trip. I was thinking about all those things in\
  \ my head when I hear a gentle call from a very beautiful Indian woman who was also\
  \ travelling via same flight with me.  \u2018Do you want some of these breads and\
  \ yes, I also got shawls?\u2019-she approached  with a gentle smile and wrapped\
  \ me up with the warm shawl distributed by the Red Cross.  It was a really nice\
  \ gesture. In a very short time, we became sisters from strangers. We talked about\
  \ many things from men to traveling to independence. We shared and created memories\
  \ together.\nThe flight officials planned to redirect us to Amsterdam airport as\
  \ the airport was still shutdown for days. \nI enriched myself with another perspective\
  \ that day. My eyes shined with joy. Anne Frank was who introduced me to Amsterdam\
  \ in her diaries and there I stood filled with excitement. Amidst the chaos, the\
  \ blood stains, the shattered glasses, I still could smell the daffodil and tulips\
  \ outside the hotel. After 5 days of staying inside this closed hall with hundreds\
  \ of people, their frustrations, anguish and complaints, I was lured to go outside\
  \ to see those beautiful flower blooming in the gloomy weather reminded me of my\
  \ idol Anne Frank. I closed my eyes and whispered, \u2018Anne, I am here!\u2019\
  - with a big grin on my face. It was my dream to visit Amsterdam and I was there(though\
  \ couldn't explore without visa). However, I was grateful to have touched, felt\
  \ and smelled the country and to have lived again."
