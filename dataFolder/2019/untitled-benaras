Text: "Varanasi (Benaras) a mystical bohemia. I have visited this city from time to\
  \ time..at critical junctures! Every time the memories have been vivid. One in common\
  \ trait is how the city evolves at one level & at the same time preserves the timeless\
  \ rituals from times immemorial.\n\nThis time too the abundance factor was reinstated.\
  \ Abundance of cattle, dharamshalas, lanes and by lanes, foreign nationals, ghats,\
  \ eateries & ofcourse the sadhus. The city holds a vivid picture of the concrete\
  \ jungle trying to overpower the traditional & arcade structures everywhere. The\
  \ ghats which used to invite with serenity now invite with commodities and rush.\
  \ Where time used to standstill, now everyone is in a rush to get somewhere, move\
  \ onto the next thing, the next tourist, the next boat ride, the next family to\
  \ offer last rites. This has it\u2019s own fiasco element for a traveler visiting\
  \ to unwind & with no agenda to tick off!\n\nBut I miss a lot more then I can cherish\
  \ from this trip. Walking down memory lane I recall seeing erudite pandits(scholars)\
  \ reciting Vedas and Upanishads. The ghats used to be the epicentre for pehelwans\
  \ (wrestlers/strong men) who would workout from morning to dusk. Touts would speak\
  \ in a concoction of bengali & bihari to attract you to their boats, stores, for\
  \ guided tours, etc. Locals used to perform surya namaskar (sun salutation) half\
  \ submerged in the ganga with the sunrise. All these are are so vivid and crisp\
  \ in my mind that a sense of melancholy carves a niche.\n\n\nBut foreign nationals\
  \ still try there best to blend in with their kurtas, jholis (cloth bags) and white\
  \ cotton sarees! A new thing that would annoyingly leave a mark is the engineered\
  \ cycle rickshaw bell which they attach to the axle of the wheel to make a  continuous\
  \ tring tring amidst traffic. I can hear it as I write this! Women have devised\
  \ a protection against heat and preying eyes(i think), by unanimously covering their\
  \ faces with scarfs.\n\nIt was most annoying, distasteful and sad that at the helm\
  \ of affairs for running the religious tourism rests on deceit & scare. It\u2019\
  s alarming to see how starting from the auto ride, to the hotel, to the priests,\
  \ to the private taxi drivers use stories of miracles & undermining the other or\
  \ rather the travelers view point to prove superiority to a level of utter nonsense\
  \ & irritation!\n\nI close with the great hope that the city would soon return to\
  \ its former glory of sound philosophy & cast aside the novice pretense & superstitions.\
  \ I derive this hope from conversations that go around the less commercialised ghats\
  \ amongst people of different nationalities. They probably don\u2019t have anything\
  \ in common but the urge to converse, to know, to share a joke, to learn a thing\
  \ or two is encouraging and reassuring. And amidst all the commercial chaos I found\
  \ great solace talking to a tea stall lady on the ghat. She lost her husband and\
  \ is resolutely challenging her situations with her son. As the sun rays spread\
  \ across the ganges, her pristine courtesy to offer a seat on the ghat stairs (cushioned\
  \ with rag blankets) is something i won\u2019t forget."
