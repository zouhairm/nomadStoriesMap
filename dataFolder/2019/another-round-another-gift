Text: "As a child, my mother used to take me to the marry-goes-around; I vividly remember\
  \ the carousels who, in order to attract my eyes enraptured by the lights, kept\
  \ shouting \"another round, another gift\". Surely, I would stick to my mother's\
  \ arm and beg her to give me the opportunity to take my gift home too, falling naively\
  \ in their traps.\nLikewise, every day in India, for better or worse, there is something\
  \ that strikes you, that marks you, that cradles you before you fall asleep.\n\n\
  We went to A., to make sure of his conditions: basically, we checked how he was\
  \ doing. Once we arrived, he welcomes us, leading the way to his place that he proudly\
  \ showed to us. A quick ride up the stairs, then immediately inside, where his mother\
  \ was standing: in a limping English, he showed us where he slept, how he had learned\
  \ to do additions, his posters of the solar system, his notebooks with all his drawings.\
  \ Finally,  he carefully bought us a picture: it seemed like he was about to show\
  \ us a poster of Indiana Jones, his favourite actor or singer. Instead, it was his\
  \ mother in her youth, at the height of his career, beautiful, astonishing. Meanwhile,\
  \ she was there, a few steps away from him, a phantom of what she was, visibly tired.\n\
  In his youth, she was a beautiful, a very educated woman. She began her career as\
  \ an actress. Like every young rising star, or at least that is what I like to think\
  \ of, she got married and had a son from her husband. She was living \"the dream\"\
  , some would say, as far as a lung cancer hit her. From that moment she lost everything,\
  \ the few riches she had, the husband, who abandoned her, as well as the beauty\
  \ that once used to distinguish her, leaving her a face marked by each day that\
  \ tiredly passes. A story not too different from many others.\n\nEven without any\
  \ income, she managed to be a tutor to his son, and have him doing some auditions\
  \ for some minor television series: the billboard with his smiley face was deployed\
  \ as a gateway.\n\nSuddenly, she began to cry. It was the cry of those who know\
  \ that they have failed, who should have done more but could not. The cry of a lost\
  \ person: she explained that his son was good as an actor, that the audition could\
  \ lead him to something but that she did not have the energy to bring him to other\
  \ auditions, thus denying his future.\n\nThis woman did not cry because she was\
  \ poor, nor because of the lung cancer, nor for the life she could have had, nor\
  \ for her lost husband: she cried because she felt guilty of not having the strength\
  \ to bring her son to auditions. She felt as she was denying his child\u2019s future,\
  \ making him a loser, as she was. Yet, in my eyes, she has been impeccable. \LOn\
  \ the other side of the room, A. was proudly holding his mother's picture.\nAnd\
  \ so I did the only thing that can be done in those cases: \"everything will be\
  \ fine\", I told her, \"there is nothing to worry about\u201D.\n\nI was lying. \n\
  \nAnd she knew it, but she still held my hands.\nI went on saying that she had nothing\
  \ to blame, that she had raised a wonderful son. She gave him everything she had\
  \ up to the last fibre of her being and all her efforts were visible in the eyes\
  \ of that small earthquake. She only had an unlucky hand, and I do believe it.\n\
  I was not feeling well. The air in the room was less and less, I needed light, I\
  \ needed a break and so I left. For good. \nOn the way home, there were some violets,\
  \ and upstairs a six-pack beer waiting for us, as usual. Suddenly, this day was\
  \ the same as any other here in India, just before leaving for a new carousel ride.\
  \ And so it will be tomorrow, \"another round, another gift\"."
