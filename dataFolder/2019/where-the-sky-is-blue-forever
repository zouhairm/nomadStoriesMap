Text: "It was the first independent trip I ever had, it was planned within a month\
  \ and regarded small amount of money. I had travelled before, but this idea was\
  \ on the next level. Me and my boyfriend had just began dating and in the fog of\
  \ fresh relationship everything seemed possible (and it was! (and still is!)). \n\
  He knew that I sometimes hitchhike to festivals or closest countries, so it seemed\
  \ only logical that now, when we are a couple, we could do this reckless thing together,\
  \ because it\u2019s always an adventure. Besides, we were just students back then,\
  \ so alternative ways of travelling suited us naturally. We both love being close\
  \ to wilderness, therefore we decided to mostly sleep in a tent or under the stars.\
  \ Not surprisingly, I was completely compelled by this idea, although a little scared\
  \ to be honest.\nIn just two weeks we planned to get to Italy, then spend some time\
  \ in Croatia and get back home, which makes more than 4000 km in total. It seemed\
  \ so far away, so utopic, but we still decided to do it, no matter how far along\
  \ we would get. One day we packed our bags and were ready to hit the road. The math\
  \ is simple, you basically just stand by the road and hope someone will pick you\
  \ up.\nThe first real struggle we had was in Poland, when we had to directly ask\
  \ people for a ride, because no one would stop while driving. This experience of\
  \ simply asking a favour to strangers was demanding for me at first, but after some\
  \ time I lost the sense of stereotypes and felt free to talk to anyone, ask questions\
  \ and stop worrying so much about the way I seem to others. I realized that I simply\
  \ have to trust the road, believe in good people and good energy. \nJust imagine:\
  \ you stand by the road with your thumb up, all excited and ready to share your\
  \ story, someone stops and after some talking invites you to stay over, because\
  \ it\u2019s on the way. You automatically say \u2018yes\u2019, knowing that otherwise\
  \ you would be sleeping in a tent by the road. You get to this persons home, get\
  \ seated by the table and some local/ national meal is prepared in front of you.\
  \ Only then you realize how sweaty, dirty, hungry and tired from the road you feel\
  \ \u2013 and it makes your eyes tear up, because no matter of beforementioned aspects\
  \ some loving soul has taken you in their home and is ready to share what they have\
  \ in exchange of hearing your story. This pure humanity has changed me as a person\
  \ \u2013 I had never felt it so strongly before.\nOur official destination was Venice,\
  \ where we had to find one specific building from a sketch my boyfriend made in\
  \ high school. He had this art teacher who was more of a life-teacher (may we all\
  \ have those!) and had wished him to visit this place someday. After that we headed\
  \ to Croatia and as soon as we got to this lone beach, we understood that it felt\
  \ like the real highlight of this trip. We felt dizzy from the sun, love, Italian\
  \ wine and mostly of realization that anything is possible. We made it to the other\
  \ side of Europe in just one week, not paying for anything on the way, except food\
  \ and some public transportation, it felt just mind-blowing: this is possible and\
  \ we have done it only now?! This was definitely one of the greatest moments of\
  \ my life. On the wave of emotions we exchanged our first i-love-you-s and spent\
  \ a magical night under a tree next to Adriatic sea. From that point forward we\
  \ have hitchhiked a lot, and had only the greatest experience. \nWe always laugh\
  \ that when my mom met my boyfriend for the first time, she jokingly said that with\
  \ this guy I can go to the other side of the world, that\u2019s how much she trusts\
  \ him with me, and, well, we took it literally."
