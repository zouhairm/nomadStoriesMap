Text: "My parents separated in 2015; they'd had problems for years--decades, if we're\
  \ being honest. They were always difficult to understand. I'm not sure that I'll\
  \ ever fully grasp their irregular ticking. \nThe year before, in 2014, I was 21.\
  \ It was a young 21; I was a late bloomer and adulthood wouldn't hurl itself at\
  \ me for three more years. We took a family road trip to Arizona, specifically a\
  \ few small cities along Route 66. Coming from Southern California, these cities\
  \ were underwhelming and often overpriced tourists traps. The significance came\
  \ from my family. \nWe had always been \"dysfunctional\" although that phrase can\
  \ hardly do the splintering and cracking of our relationships justice.\nBut here,\
  \ in these dingy towns, we were one. We were a family in more than just shared names\
  \ and visage. \nThe day before we left, we saw the Grand Canyon. The air was heavy\
  \ with humidity; the small hike to the edge of the canyon left us breathless. I\
  \ was expecting another tourist trap. \nIt wasn't.\nWe separated.\nI walked to the\
  \ edge of the canyon, and sat down. The canyon is difficult to describe; majestic\
  \ can hardly touch the experience of being there and dangling your feet into infinity.\
  \ The humidity had vanished into the open air above the crevasse. The sky was purple,\
  \ the canyon a rainbow of jeweled earth tones. \nThere was the moment that I froze\
  \ my parents and my siblings.\nIt's 2019 and I'm 25.\nI don't talk to anyone but\
  \ my brother. Adulthood demanded relationships in exchange for experience. \nIn\
  \ moments where I try to reconcile with my family, I see them as they were on the\
  \ day of infinity and the canyon. I'm 21, sitting on the edge of an abyss, and I\
  \ love my family. \nWe are the canyon, stretching deeply and unbroken, a testament\
  \ to forever."
