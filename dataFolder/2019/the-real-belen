Text: "I wander through the six square block market that serves as the gate to Belen\
  \ - the Floating City - the Venice of The Amazon.  \n\nMy head turns from dead crocodile\
  \ bodies to piles of bananas ten feet tall as I peruse the market. I start to get\
  \ nervous about a small man who seems to be following me astutely. I have been warned\
  \ that this is a dangerous neighbourhood. Just as I am about to grab my bag and\
  \ run, he calls out in a friendly voice. \n\n\u201CWould you like to see Belen?\u201D\
  \ \n\nI look down at myself and realize that I have taken no care to disguise my\
  \ gringo backpacker status. \n\n\u201CI thought I already was\" I respond. \n\n\
  The man points at the water. \u201CThe real Belen\u201D he says. \n\nI don't make\
  \ a habit of accepting tours from strangers in unsafe neighbourhoods. But Belen\
  \ is a mystery with no way to truly experience it without a boat and guide. \n\n\
  He can tell I am apprehensive so he holds up a large binder and opens it. Inside\
  \ are pages of handwritten reviews of tours and of their guide, Hector. The man,\
  \ Hector, beams at me as we flip through his homemade TripAdvisor. I am intrigued\
  \ by the archaic approach and the marketing ingenuity. \n\nThe book works on me\
  \ and minutes later we are balancing our way across a plank of wood that leads to\
  \ some of the \u201Cfloating houses\u201D. The more industrious have put layers\
  \ of tires under a base so that the small structures float in place on the river.\
  \ But many of the homes have simply been raised by stilts. \n\nWe get into Hector\u2019\
  s boat and weave through the waterways that serve as Belen\u2019s streets. Children\
  \ play water polo outside and bath in the river. We pass floating restaurants, gas\
  \ stations and a schoolhouse. \n\nHector tells me that most of the population come\
  \ from villages deep in the jungle. They move to Belen to try and set up a life\
  \ in Iquitos, but city life is challenging for those without money or education.\
  \ So they end up here in this settlement, with no running water, sewage, or police,\
  \ desperately trying to join modernity. \n\nHector used to earn his living as a\
  \ fisherman but climate change has decimated the fish population. He says that each\
  \ year the Amazon has longer dry seasons and more viscous floods. The dry season\
  \ creates unsanitary conditions and the floods destroy many of the homes. \n\nWe\
  \ continue to troll along in his wooden boat, which is not much larger than a kayak.\
  \ The motor starts to putter and eventually gives out. Hector tries to revive it\
  \ with passion but his attempts are futile. \n\nHector breaks down too. Tears fill\
  \ his eyes. \n\nHe apologises to me profusely both for the inconvenience and his\
  \ demeanour. I tell him it's no trouble and I\u2019d like to help. Hector dries\
  \ his tears and tracks down a friend to pull us to Hector's home. I get the sense\
  \ that he will not be able to afford to fix or replace the motor. \n\nWe get to\
  \ his home, a one-room house. Two mattresses lay on either end of the room. One\
  \ for hector and one for his three daughters. Hector shows me his home with pride,\
  \ pointing out the hotplate where they cook. \n\nI sit on the damp floor of his\
  \ floating house and ask him questions about his business. In half an hour I have\
  \ a digital marketing plan for him. We will call his new business \"The Real Belen\"\
  . I tell him I will call him to help him start on his new path to riches. But Hector\
  \ has no phone. \n\nI ask him for an email address instead. He tells me that a friend\
  \ of his has an email address but that it's hard to get to a computer. He looks\
  \ down, ashamed.\n\u201CAlso, I don\u2019t write good, even in Spanish\u201D\n\n\
  We make the journey back to Iquitos in silence. The excitement of only a few moments\
  \ ago is gone. I feel awful that I got his hopes up and that I didn't understand\
  \ a solution from my world was not going to work in his."
