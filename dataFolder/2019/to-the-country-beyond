Text: "to journey that will always be close to my heart . traveling is always a new\
  \ experience especially to a place you have never been to before wvery second of\
  \ the journey makes it different . the culture the food the people make a impact\
  \ and when you feel bad to leave is when you know that is the connection you needed.\
  \ i have a bucket list of atlest travelling to 10 countries before i die it\u2019\
  s not hard one but with the work effecting the journey you take it makes the traveling\
  \ important of some sort i am a architect buildings spaces effects of the space\
  \ the country the culture everything matters that will bring in new ideas in my\
  \ design and work . everytime i go to a new place the first thing we see is the\
  \ roads and buildings that gives you a vision of the entire country without you\
  \ even noticing and everyone must experience that feeling and to travel is like\
  \ to breathe for me when stuck in the regular routine of life it\u2019s just being\
  \ still and dead i wanna fly i wanna breath and i will do anything to just do that\
  \ . to be continued"
