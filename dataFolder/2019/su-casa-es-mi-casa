Text: "A faint knock on my door heralded that tender voice I had grown accustomed\
  \ to for all of a week. Noylin Vargas looked dotingly upon us American exchange\
  \ students. She was just as suave as our study abroad coordinator Sylvia had promised\
  \ and though we barely spoke her language, to us she was Mama Tica. \n\nShe knocked\
  \ again and this time, I caught the word comida. Would I like any food? I saw through\
  \ Mama Tica\u2019s ruse--if I wanted to eat, I\u2019d have to leave the cozy confines\
  \ of my guest room and face the flood of flurrying Spanish in the living room. When\
  \ Mama Tica said family from the foot of the Arenal Volcano in Alajuela would be\
  \ over today for a potluck, I never would have expected what seemed to be the entire\
  \ Vargas clan, everything from the youngest nietos to the oldest abuelos. I was\
  \ sure to be an instant target of interest, probed with questions about home, Hollywood,\
  \ and of course, Trump--always Trump. \n\nWould I have the cajones to tell them,\
  \ in the midst of their feverous rapture, \u201CNo hablo espa\xF1ol?\u201D\n\nBut\
  \ my grumbling stomach egged me on toward the wafts of gallo pinto, frijoles molidos,\
  \ and arroyo con pollo permeating the room. \u201CSi, estoy en camino,\u201D I called\
  \ out. \n\nI readied myself, diving into my Costa Rican Spanish Handbook a final\
  \ time before exiting the familiar confines of my dormitory and toward the partition,\
  \ the last thing standing between me and oblivion. Pushing it aside, a wave of rapid-fire\
  \ Spanish hit me like a green season aguacero. I slid my way through the tight crowd,\
  \ politely excusing myself and following the wafts of home-cooked Central American\
  \ cuisine to the kitchen.\n\n\u201CAnthony, vete aqu\xED!\u201D\n\nBehind me, Mama\
  \ Tica stood with two teenagers, both shifting awkwardly. The boy to her right looked\
  \ about high school age, with a hint of a mustache setting in just above his upper\
  \ lip. The girl on her left looked older and more affable. She was gaunt-faced and\
  \ thin, with glasses that drew attention to her brown eyes, one sharp and acute,\
  \ the other slightly lazy.\n\nBefore I could introduce myself, Mama Tica began,\
  \ \u201CEste es mi sobrino y sobrina. Quer\xEDa que conocieras a\u2026\u201D\n\n\
  I could feel the blood already flooding to my cheeks as my brain chewed and struggled\
  \ to parse the sentence structure. My eyes wandered to the two kids. What would\
  \ they think of this gringo who couldn\u2019t keep up with simple conversation?\n\
  \n\u201CWe\u2019re both learning English,\u201D interrupted the girl, bashfully\
  \ adjusting her glasses. \u201CMy aunt just thought you might want to talk to a\
  \ local who spoke.\u201D \n\nThe three of us migrated to the couch, where I sat\
  \ between Susan and Frid, a cup of iced, strawberry Fanta (a Vargas refresco favorite)\
  \ in hand. Between mouthfuls of chip, I painted a picture of sunny beaches and political\
  \ curmudgeons. But the more I talked, the more I realized just how little I had\
  \ to offer. She was fluent and unphased by my colloquialisms. Her family even had\
  \ plans to visit an uncle in Virginia in December. But Susan insisted we meet again.\n\
  \nA week later, we crossed the central plaza, scattering pigeons into the evening\
  \ air as we passed a cluster of high schoolers dancing to \u201CMi Gente\u201D in\
  \ a gazebo. We stopped by the Fort\xEDn de Heredia, a decommissioned military lookout\
  \ tower, the local ice cream shop, and of course, the city chapel where I found\
  \ out just how American I was. Silenc\xEDo! Susan hissed, jabbing me in the side\
  \ as I forgot to lower my voice.\n\nOutside, an earlier thunderstorm had given way\
  \ to a gorgeous sunset, spreading like a blanket over the Spanish-tiled ground.\
  \ Three thousand miles from home, I turned to this girl I had just met a few days\
  \ ago and saw una hermana. I felt Costa Rican, right down to the Saprissa jersey\
  \ I proudly sported. \n\nSusan never did see the Atlantic coastline or the Shenandoah.\
  \ Basically, no money, she told me over Whatsapp, with a shrug-of-the-shoulders\
  \ emoji. But we never lost contact. I suppose familia never does."
