Text: "I did not see another Black person in China until I travelled to Kangding.\
  \ A city known for its political unrest, Kangding sits on the historical border\
  \ of China and Tibet.\n\nWe found each other in a busy roadside restaurant. The\
  \ air was pregnant with humidity and the mosquitos were unrelenting. It was a day\
  \ like molasses, as my grandmother would say. \n\nEmpty bottles of Tsingtao covered\
  \ the tables and were a better marker of time than any clock. It was getting late\
  \ and after a 36 hour train ride from Beijing, all I wanted to do was eat.\n\nWe\
  \ noticed one another immediately. He was an old man with black skin like leather,\
  \ pulled taught over his frail frame. The old man\u2019s eyes welled up in tears\
  \ when he saw me, and I knew why.  \n\nBeing black in China is lonely. \n\nWhile\
  \ I had adjusted to life in Beijing, I could not eradicate an overwhelming sense\
  \ of isolation due to the color of my skin. In China, I was a spectacle. I grew\
  \ used to people taking my photo and young children asking to touch my skin. I let\
  \ more than a few people call me Serena Williams because I did not have the heart\
  \ (nor the language) to correct them. \n\nThe old man pointed to the table next\
  \ to him and I took a seat. At first, we relied on gestures and the few phrases\
  \ we knew in one another\u2019s language to communicate.\n\nThe old man, who\u2019\
  s name I never learned, pointed to various pictures on the menu. I trusted these\
  \ were his personal suggestions, so I ordered each one. When the plates came, he\
  \ was impressed as I devoured the chicken hearts and blood stew and sucked the meat\
  \ clean from the fried chicken feet. \n\nCould he tell that I was raised on chitlins,\
  \ tongue, and ham hocks? Did he know that this was the meal my heart and soul needed\
  \ 7,000 miles from home? \n\nThe old man had questions for me and so the waiter\
  \ found a local who could speak both English and Chinese. The old man wanted to\
  \ know about my family and where they came from. I explained New York City by way\
  \ of the South. We spoke of American Slavery and racism in both of our countries.\
  \ \n\nI learned that he was 84 years old, born and raised in a village on the other\
  \ side of this mountain range. His parents abandoned him as a child. For years,\
  \ he had believed the color of his skin was a mark left behind by some terrible\
  \ curse. Until now. \n\nThe old man took my hand in his and held it tight. He told\
  \ me I was the first and only black person he had ever met. That for the first time\
  \ in his life, he did not feel cursed because he did not feel alone. \n\nThe old\
  \ man ordered a round of baijou. He showed me how to drink it without getting sick\
  \ since this funky fermented liquor can be difficult to stomach for the uninitiated.\
  \ Another round was ordered, followed by another. \n\nThe men and women at the neighboring\
  \ tables raised their bottles of Tsingtao and toasted us. They said: \"Let's celebrate\
  \ the two black people who have finally found each other here in Kangding.\""
