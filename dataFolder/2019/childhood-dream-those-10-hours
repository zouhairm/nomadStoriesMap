Text: "Back to the time when night time felt like afternoon to me, I was in the middle\
  \ up above in the sky middle of nowhere. Apparently that\u2019s what I thought,\
  \ when the navigation on the screen showed in \u201CFrance\u201D, and voice I heard\
  \ saying we\u2019ll land in next half an hour. Gushing happiness in every neuron\
  \ of my body, synaptic complex on its peak. \nLooked outside my aeroplane  window,\
  \ it was hue of Orange  and pink  colour, sky with white clouds and the sun spreading\
  \ rays I could appreciate well ,everything was  amazing, I never could have imagined.\n\
  Next thought   came in my mind Ah ! It\u2019s morning we are late, flight has been\
  \ delayed, I might have slept for long because everything in front of me was like\
  \ I am dreaming, but that can\u2019t be possible I had espresso shot just  few \
  \ hours back  said to myself, caffeine never fails.   I asked a beautiful lady sitting\
  \ next to me what\u2019s the time here ,as I had lost the count of time and wasn\u2019\
  t feeling well oriented to time and space after 14 hours long journey ,Jet lag was\
  \ happening ! Has our flight been delayed ?  Weren\u2019t  we  supposed to reach\
  \ by night 10 O\u2019clock. She said, no we are on time, sun sets late in France\
  \ she said and continued with her makeup. Silly me I didn\u2019t know. All those\
  \ years when I had been dreaming about Paris just thought of the Iron Lady, Love\
  \  and Fashion .\n Kept looking out of the window, and the lady sitting next to\
  \ me doing touch-ups as if  someone special to her was waiting for her at the airport.\
  \ \nSoon it all started turning dark   saw the city of lights at first glance and\
  \ the Iron Lady standing still. How amazing! \nI was just aww struck seeing amazing\
  \ lights and the tower shinning like a diamond in the middle of the city . As soon\
  \ as plane turned and we landed. Happiness was in heart, when sound I heard \u201C\
  welcome to PARIS \u201D I was all excited. Saw the lady hugging her fianc\xE9 at\
  \ the airport and there I was thinking, I was right all those years to think and\
  \ believe Paris \u201CCity of Love and Lights\u201D !\nIt was dark ,took a taxi\
  \ from airport to hotel. Staring at the lights in the city, planning what to do\
  \ in next days. Soon I reached hotel. Room was beautiful as I imagined, opened the\
  \ curtains it was all surrounded by big glass windows and there it was  Iron Lady\
  \ directly blinking in its all gleam at a few meters distance. \nCouldn\u2019t resist\
  \ kept looking at the lady standing still \u201C Tear in eyes \u201D,I sat on the\
  \ floor staring at the lady  ,couldn\u2019t get up and order some dinner, had top\
  \ ramen and sat on the floor watching Lady all those hours till it stopped blinking,\
  \ had the finest company for dinner one could ever have, me and the Lady, Ladies\
  \ dinner it was !\nDidn\u2019t want to miss a second watching my dream. Soon lights\
  \ turned off Iron Lady slept so did I. \nWoke up at 6 o\u2019clock in the morning,\
  \ curtains were all open from all sides and it was orange again could see rays everywhere.\
  \ First thing I saw Eiffel tower .Wondering if am I dreaming again, NO SILLY TALKED\
  \ TO MY SELF, YOU ARE HERE IN PARIS ! \nHad my black coffee, coffee and Iron lady\
  \   at the same time what a morning. Rushed to  see lady in the morning , reached\
  \ in front, stood in the  que, finally entered and touched the Lady. Heart started\
  \ beating fast!\nFinally it was just me and the Iron Lady. Dream of my childhood\
  \ coming true, all those 26 years I grew up watching  in the movies, moment I had\
  \ been dreaming about  and  then the dream was standing still  in the  front. \n\
  Never have I ever been so happier in all those years .Continued with my trip to\
  \ Paris and Normandy, exploring Paris was an amazing experience indeed, the first\
  \ 10 hours in France are incomparable.  \nHappiness is to finally live a dream,\
  \ you have always dreamt of!"
