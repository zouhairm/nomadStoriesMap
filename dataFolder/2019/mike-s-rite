Text: "\"Sometimes the worst you can do is the best you can do,\" Mike said, hesitantly\
  \ taking the phone out of my hands. As he navigated through the Maps app for us,\
  \ I couldn't help but laugh at how out-of touch he looked in the desolate, steam-filled\
  \ subway platform. He was a mythical hero ripped right out of the Roman art gallery\
  \ at The Met: tall, no-doubt formed in the finest marble, and built like an Olympian\
  \ who got a discount at the local tattoo parlour. \n\nJust moments ago, his gaunt\
  \ gaze was haunting my friend and I as we stood impatiently waiting for the delayed\
  \ train to take us back to our AIRBNB in Queens. After a day of hiking up and down\
  \ Brooklyn's various streets, taking pictures we never posted, and enjoying the\
  \ bubbling food scene, we were just a few yawns away from falling asleep. Mike was\
  \ a classic Brooklyn stereotype and I feel no dispensation in admitting my prejudice.\
  \ He towered over us and felt like a threat with his wife beater that wholly displayed\
  \ his colorless and chaotic tattoos. In his hand, he carried a duffel bag, which\
  \ held his gym attire. For a brief moment though, I imagined the bag carried a mobster\u2019\
  s head.\n\nAlone on the subway platform at 1 A.M, we no doubt felt the need to take\
  \ a step back and turn our frames as his eyes kept wandering over to us. We misconstrued\
  \ his curiosity and selflessness for a mugging in meditation. \n\nOh, how wrong\
  \ we were.\n\nChattering away, discussing the lateness of the subway and how we\
  \ were more than likely on the wrong platform, Mike approached us and our breaths\
  \ seized. \n\n\"Tourists?\" he asked in the soft, contempt tone Tom Hanks had in\
  \ BIG. \n\nWe replied in affirmation. \n\n\"Well, lemme help you out! Youse going\
  \ to Queens, eh? Well, this the train, but this one skips a few stops,\u201D he\
  \ said as his lisp began to unfurl.\n\nLooking at my phone, he asked if he could\
  \ use it to navigate us. I felt a little tinge of terror, perhaps his meditation\
  \ was now being put into practice. However, I always felt it was inappropriate to\
  \ disavow kindness, especially in the Big Apple. Everyone told us New Yorkers are\
  \ too occupied, non-helpful folk. That was not the case at all.\n\nTaking my phone,\
  \ the Dave Bautista look alike confirmed we were on the wrong platform, telling\
  \ us, \"It happens,\" as he guided us to the next platform, \"But make sure it don't\
  \ happen again! The next train woulda come in 40 minutes!\" \n\nMike had time to\
  \ kill and conversations to form. In our interlude of waiting for the MTA, and the\
  \ 20 minute subway ride, he told us of his Cuban heritage and where to get the best\
  \ Cubanos in Brooklyn. Unfortunately, my friend and I didn't eat pork, but he still\
  \ insisted we get the chicken variety. As we entered the train, Mike made it is\
  \ his mission to make sure we didn't waste our last few days in the city. He pulled\
  \ out a notepad from his duffel bag which was filled with metrics on his weight\
  \ lifting, and scribbled down a bunch of places for us to go.\n\nI had never seen\
  \ a grown man smile with so much glee when I told him we had partaken in about a\
  \ quarter of his list, \"Good man! Not wasting his time!\" he exclaimed in the empty\
  \ subway train. He reminded us to come see him play next time we were in town, because\
  \ of course he was in a jazz band. When his stop came, he gave us a handshake so\
  \ firm and fierce that it's ingrained in my bones. It\u2019s impossible to shake\
  \ a hand without thinking of Mike, a man so hell-bent on helping and conversing\
  \ with others that he was willing to get just a little less sleep."
