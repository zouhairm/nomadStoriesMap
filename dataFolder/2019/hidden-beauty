Text: "I often felt that discovering a town, city or place is always a highly personal\
  \ experience to which most of my enjoyment comes from my human interactions. However,\
  \ more often then not my love of a place, it\u2019s vibe and how I felt soaking\
  \ it all up is the memory long left in my mind. Sometimes still, I find myself longing\
  \ more for places rather than people. \n\nMy love and connection to many cities\
  \ boils down to the finer details of life lived there, sometimes too frequent in\
  \ number and feeling to find the words to express it all. The smells, the way of\
  \ life and all the gentle details only a fresh pair of eyes could see as one does\
  \ when everything is new are what move me most. \n\nI remember being in Berlin and\
  \ looking up at the quiet building fronts and wondering about all the lives and\
  \ stories that existed behind closed doors. I loved how thoughtful and conscientious\
  \ aspects of modern day German culture felt to me. My sentiments can be expressed\
  \ through thinking of the type of person I\u2019d imagine habituating there. Perhaps\
  \ the cuteness of Germany could be likened to a meticulous, acutely funny but painstakingly\
  \ organised uncle whom everyone loved.\n\nUnsurprisingly, the enjoyment is a selfish\
  \ one in which my relationship with myself is invigorated with all these new experiences\
  \ but my gift is the expresssion of all the beauty of the world I discover through\
  \ creative expression of writting, painting and photography. \n\nFor me, meaning\
  \ is everything and I hope to capture photos of city scenes that I find awe inspiring\
  \ and then I can bring them back home and paint them. I think writting about the\
  \ experience through a travel blog would be the icing on the cake to expressing\
  \ to the world the rich feeling I gather from the world outside me which is particularly\
  \ heightened through discovering new places!"
