Text: "I fell in love in Rome, but not with a person, with the city and myself in\
  \ it. Rome is so much more than just pizza, gelato, cobblestone. It\u2019s a feeling.\
  \ \n\nI sit near the famous Fontana di Trevi, a staple in every rom-com set in Italy.\
  \ The fountain is breath taking, of course it is. But what takes away from the beauty\
  \ is the swarming hoards of tourists, each of them desperately trying to elbow their\
  \ way to the edge of the fountain, while clutching a selfie-stick in one hand and\
  \ a gold coin in the other. \n\nI imagine what the fountain looks like at 4 or 5am\
  \ in the morning, and decide to make sure I return during the night, for a more\
  \ selfishly solo experience. Before leaving, I fall into a conversation with an\
  \ 85-year-old man from New Mexico and he tells me about his time in the army, his\
  \ two marriages, to choose carefully who you marry and to keep travelling, to always\
  \ keep travelling. As much and as far as possible, because memories will be worth\
  \ more than any amount of money in the bank. \u201CTravelling alone changes you,\u201D\
  \ he affirms me, and god I hope so. \n\nI meet Ciara, a local Italian, just outside\
  \ the walls of Vatican, at Piazza del Risorgimento. We walk the riverside for a\
  \ while, before crossing a bridge with angels lining the railing. And talk about\
  \ universities, London, feelings of loss, confusion and never being enough. We end\
  \ up at a market square, Campo de\u2019 Fiori, with a statue of a hooded man who\
  \ had once tried to overthrow the church, Ciara tells me. We share a couple of Aperol\
  \ Spritzes before ordering a pitcher of vodka-cranberry. We watch the sky turn into\
  \ swirling cotton candy pinks and purples and then into a deep blue, quickly fading\
  \ into black. The stars were replaced by street vendors launching purple twirling\
  \ light up toys into the air and hustling the tourists. \n\nItalian women are light-handed\
  \ with their make-up, mascara and red lipstick completes them. Because they already\
  \ know they\u2019re gorgeous. Their wild dark curls and sun kissed skin concludes\
  \ their look. And when they hastily tie up their hair on the dance floor, that\u2019\
  s when you know that shit\u2019s about to go down. They\u2019ll swing their hips,\
  \ seductively grab the hem of their dress, grinding themselves against you, pulling\
  \ you into the music and themselves.\n\nWe\u2019re slightly intoxicated as we decide\
  \ to take another stroll. We pass the Colosseum, which will probably never fail\
  \ to take my breath away with its sheer magnitude. We walk hand in hand in silence,\
  \ taking in the sleepy Rome. I\u2019m in awe of the semi lit, shadowy monuments\
  \ on every corner. Rome can be overwhelming, with its too many monuments and too\
  \ much beauty. But at the same time everything feels just right. \n\nFontana di\
  \ Trevi at 4am in the morning is pure magic, almost ethereal. The sharp edges of\
  \ the marble statues looking intangible under the soft glow from the submerged lights.\
  \ We are alone, not considering the around the clock guards patrolling the fountain.\
  \ We sit facing the fountain on the damp stairs, in complete stillness with only\
  \ the soothing sound of cascading water filling the space. After which felt like\
  \ a lifetime sitting there, I finally got up to walk to the edge of the fountain,\
  \ to touch the water, throw a coin over my shoulder and make a wish.\n\nSitting\
  \ at the Trevi Fountain will forever seem like a dream. Ciara asked a passing stranger\
  \ to take a photo of us sitting on the edge of the fountain, and in the midst of\
  \ the stranger taking photos of us, I kissed her. It wasn\u2019t love or fireworks\
  \ or butterflies, but it was 4am, some vodka-cranberries and the Trevi, and that\
  \ was magic on its own. \n\nI went to Rome alone. Spent a week there and not only\
  \ started my love affair with the city, but I finally started a love affair with\
  \ myself, falling in love with myself inside the Eternal City. Not to sound like\
  \ a fucking clich\xE9, but how could I not? It\u2019s Rome!"
