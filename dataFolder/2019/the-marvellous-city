Text: "Think back to 2010... What were you doing; can you even remember?\n\nAfter\
  \ leaving uni with a fashion degree and equal amounts of debt and confusion, I jumped\
  \ from recruitment agency to recruitment agency, until I finally secured a permanent\
  \ job at the local Jobcentre. Ironically, that\u2019s the only job there was!\n\n\
  Day after day of trying my hardest to help people find work, knowing there weren\u2019\
  t any jobs, really started to make me think. I enjoyed the job, I liked the people,\
  \ but there had to more to life; this couldn\u2019t be it. I\u2019d been lucky enough\
  \ to experience nice family holidays in various locations, but loving fashion, beaches\
  \ and hot weather; I\u2019d always been drawn to Brazil and the idea of going to\
  \ visit one day.\n\nThat\u2019s when I came across a company online offering an\
  \ experience of a lifetime \u2013 for an affordable amount, you could pay for a\
  \ volunteer placement, living in a shared house in the local community in Rio de\
  \ Janeiro, with one of the options being to help make costumes for the world famous\
  \ Carnival! As soon as I found it, I knew I had to go. It would mean nearly six\
  \ weeks away from work, but I checked with management and they said to go for it.\
  \ Thinking back now, it wasn\u2019t very thoughtful of me, considering it was the\
  \ recession, but it was that situation that pushed me to take action, do something\
  \ extreme and take the leap; or I may never have done it.\n\nOh my god! I\u2019\
  d booked to go to Brazil, by myself. What had I done?! Family and friends fully\
  \ supported me but as the trip got closer, thought it necessary to share horror\
  \ stories of just how dangerous the country was. Brilliant!\n\nAfter hours of travelling,\
  \ I remember getting to the house. I think it was dark, and it was so hot and sticky.\
  \ A French guy greeted me. Nobody else was in. I found a spare bed, and I think\
  \ not long after that I fell asleep. I remember waking in the night to the sound\
  \ of a band rehearsing, and possibly a tropical storm outside, but kept drifting\
  \ back to sleep. The next morning I woke up and went upstairs in search of a bathroom.\
  \ The shower was massive \u2013 it was more of a big private room with a shower\
  \ head. After walking past people moaning about dogs running round the house with\
  \ flees, weeing everywhere, and the state of the tiny kitchen; I stood in the shower\
  \ and cried. What the hell had I done? I was now stuck here for over a month, in\
  \ this grotty hell-hole, not knowing anyone. I don\u2019t really remember exactly\
  \ what happened after that but I soon changed my opinion of the house, the people\
  \ and the place.\n\nI did meet some lovely people but bravely/stupidly spent a lot\
  \ of time going off on solo adventures; heading to the beach after finishing at\
  \ the samba school for the day, checking out local spots and popping to the shops;\
  \ I wanted to make the most of every moment. Rio was the most energetic, colourful,\
  \ beautiful mishmash of a place I\u2019d ever seen and I completely fell head over\
  \ heels. Don\u2019t get me wrong, I was on constant high alert checking that nobody\
  \ was following me, drawing cash out from inside the bank and stashing it in my\
  \ bra, and I was the only one who had an \u2018attempted mugging\u2019 and managed\
  \ to get away; nobody else was that lucky.\n \nDespite it being the most dangerous\
  \ place I\u2019ve ever been to, I\u2019d go back in a heartbeat. I\u2019ve never\
  \ experienced such a feeling of magic. The green peaks of Sugarloaf Mountain contrast\
  \ with the bustling city, that melts in to some of the most jaw-dropping beaches\
  \ I\u2019ve ever seen\u2026 Flashes of rainbow-coloured carnival costumes; it\u2019\
  s just so breath-taking. I miss the fresh coconuts, acai and grilled cheese sandwiches.\
  \ The people are poor, but they have the happiest faces I\u2019ve ever seen. They\
  \ have a sparkle in their eyes that I\u2019ll never forget, because they\u2019re\
  \ from the Cidade Maravilhosa, the Marvellous City, and don\u2019t they just know\
  \ it."
