Text: "People in my country sometimes refer to me as a \u201Cwanna be foreigner\u201D\
  . But I\u2019m a simple person, trying to live his childhood dream. While living\
  \ in America, I was always taught and talked to about the \u201CAmerican Dream\u201D\
  . I always dreamt of finishing my education, having a nice professional career,\
  \ and having a family of four in a very warm, cozy house. Growing up in America,\
  \ I did my best to try and achieve that dream no matter what it took. With a big\
  \ smile on my face, I remember talking to everyone I knew about having and achieving\
  \ my American dream. One day, after playing a football game for my high school that\
  \ we lost, I remember my coach telling me to put my chin up and smile because everything\
  \ will get better. In my mind right away I said to myself \u201CHe\u2019s right!\
  \ I still have my dream to follow and everything will get better\u201D. Than that\
  \ day came, a day that I never expected, a day that killed my American dream and\
  \ every other dream that I had. \n\u201CSon, I\u2019m sorry, but you have to leave\
  \ this country and go back to Yemen.\u201D I remember that day like it was just\
  \ yesterday. Everything around me that was always lighting up turned off. My smile\
  \ turned into tears. All the friends that I made during my whole childhood disappeared\
  \ because of one sentence, \u201CSon, I\u2019m sorry, but you have to leave this\
  \ country and go back to Yemen.\u201D I started dying slowly, realizing that everything\
  \ that I built during my life was shattered into pieces in a blink of an eye. While\
  \ I was waiting at the airport, I remember researching about Yemen. I met a woman\
  \ who worked for an organization that told me and my mom a story that brought tears\
  \ to my eyes. Those tears were not only because the story was sad, but also tears\
  \ of fear. \nShe visited a health clinic in North of Yemen. The facility was small\
  \ and very isolated, but there were still dozens of families waiting to see the\
  \ doctor. In a country with a bad health system, these facilities represent a desperately\
  \ needed lifeline. She got to meet 1-year-old Leila and her mother Rayah. Leila\
  \ is suffering from Severe Acute Malnutrition the deadliest form of extreme hunger\
  \ which can easily claim the lives of young children. In Yemen, it often does. When\
  \ Rayah took Leila\u2019s shirt off to be examined, she struggled to keep her tears\
  \ away. The woman was shocked at how painfully thin she was. The woman said, \u201C\
  What would you do take one child to the hospital or feed the others?\u201D \nA year\
  \ after arriving to Yemen, a war started and crushed my life and dreams even more.\
  \ This current conflict in Yemen has banished more than 2 million people across\
  \ the country since March 2015. I always heard about families getting killed while\
  \ trying to escape the violence of armed clashes. Some families even crossed the\
  \ border into neighboring countries in an attempt to find some kind of security\
  \ and provide their children with a better future. While I couldn\u2019t even move\
  \ an inch out of the house without being threatened and called the \u201Cwanna be\
  \ foreigner\u201D. \nI made a promise to myself, that no matter what, one day I\
  \ will get back on my feet and make all my dreams come true. When that day comes,\
  \ I would love expending on more details about my life-story and telling the whole\
  \ world how I survived and accomplished all my dreams. I will let young people like\
  \ me know that no matter what happens to you, your dreams have to turn into goals\
  \ and you must achieve them."
