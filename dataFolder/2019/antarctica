Text: "I was standing on the bow of the National Geographic Explorer. We had spent\
  \ two days crossing the Drake passage to reach Antarctica, the coldest, driest,\
  \ and least populated continent in the world. Since no one country controls this\
  \ place, only a few research stations are populated year round. Anywhere from about\
  \ 1000 people in the winter, to about 5000 in the summer could be on the continent,\
  \ and on that day, I was one. \n      Being so remote, difficult to access, and\
  \ with no political affiliation, you would expect this icescape to be nearly untouched\
  \ by humans.  We were careful to sanitize our boots and gear to remove any seeds,\
  \ bugs, or pollen that might contaminate the landscape, but this frozen place had\
  \ felt the effects of humanity long before me. We visited Whaler\u2019s Bay with\
  \ the wreck of an old ship and the ruins of an abandoned whaling operation. Derelict\
  \ buildings, old barrels, and other mangled relics were tucked into the snow along\
  \ with penguin colonies and lounging seals, like old scars of the bloody seal and\
  \ whaling industries.\n    We made landfall and hiked up to the top of a hill. I\
  \ was shedding my cold weather gear as we went, partly from the exertion of the\
  \ hike, and partly because of the temperature. It was almost 60 degrees fahrenheit.\
  \ I never thought I\u2019d be standing on the Antarctic peninsula, let alone dressed\
  \ in a long sleeved t-shirt and no jacket. Evidence of climate change was everywhere,\
  \ from record temperatures to the giant crack in the Larsen Ice Shelf.  My naturalist\
  \ guide told me she\u2019s been coming here for the last 20 years. Where they used\
  \ to see colonies of Adelie penguins, they now see Gentoos, as the Adelies have\
  \ retreated from the peninsula to colder coastlines farther east. \n    To my left\
  \ I heard a low boom followed by cracking sounds. I turned my head just in time\
  \ to see a large chunk of ice calve and then tumble into the water. I also took\
  \ that plunge. I have a certificate to prove it. It says that it acknowledges this\
  \ act of \u201Cundoubted courage and extraordinary foolishness\u201D. I never expected\
  \ myself to voluntarily jump into icy water, but that\u2019s the thing about travel.\
  \ Those little moments that present you an opportunity. I knew if I didn\u2019t\
  \ do it, I would never have another opportunity. If I did it and hated it, I would\
  \ never have to do it again. \n     I listened to the curious Antarctic sounds as\
  \ we cruised Lemaire Channel. The ice hissed and popped in the water, and scraped\
  \ the keel of the ship. New sights, sounds, and experiences surrounded me. That\u2019\
  s why I keep going. People often say to me \u201Coh, you\u2019ve been everywhere!\u201D\
  \ \u201CNot yet\u201D I say. \u201CBut it\u2019s on my list.\u201D"
