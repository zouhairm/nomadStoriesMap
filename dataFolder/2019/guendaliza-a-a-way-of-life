Text: "The trip I never wanted to happen had finally come. It\u2019s been years since\
  \ the last time I visited this humble little community, but when I got that phone\
  \ call, the clear images and sensations I still had on my memories immediately raised.\
  \ Though Santa Mar\xEDa Yaves\xEDa, a small town of barely 500 inhabitants in the\
  \ northern Sierra of Oaxaca, demands to take a bumpy 3 hours ride to reach its vast\
  \ peaceful landscapes, the journey was going to be worth it.\n\nA narrow rocky road\
  \ through the mountains in the middle of a forest so saturated of vegetation that\
  \ sometimes even cuts off all visibility. Ears popping as the altitude starts to\
  \ hit on your way up on the Sierra. The sound of the rivers and the woodpeckers\
  \ on the background. From time to time a lost donkey or rooster jumping out of nowhere\
  \ trying to cross the road. So many flashbacks starting to burst, but there\u2019\
  s one single thought I held in my mind during the entire trip: my grandma.\n\nAdelita\
  \ as we called her, had just passed away, and my family and I were on our way to\
  \ her last goodbye as her desire was to be buried in her birth town. She was born\
  \ and raised there, but spent the rest of her life in Oaxaca City, not so far from\
  \ her birth home, nevertheless she always kept her longing of the mountain lifestyle\
  \ rooted deep in her heart. \nAs we were getting closer to Yaves\xEDa, I was able\
  \ to remember why.\n\nThe landscape is undoubtedly identifiable to know we\u2019\
  ve arrived. Still on the tight rocky path, but now full of pink and white roses,\
  \ calla lilies and multiple color geraniums. A cold breeze and fresh clean air of\
  \ a town nested amidst the edge of two mountains where pine trees meet the clouds.\
  \ A community only divided by the Shoo Ra River that runs right in the middle, and\
  \ the bridges that bond both settlements of little wood cottages with always smoky\
  \ chimneys. \u201CAdelita is back home\u201D my mom said.\n\nLike in many other\
  \ cultures, instead of mourning, death is celebrated as a transition of the spirit,\
  \ a commemoration filled with ancient believes and customs, and this town is one\
  \ of the clearest examples of these millenary traditions. I\u2019ve been to funerals\
  \ and memorial services in the past, but I\u2019ve never had the honor to appreciate\
  \ such level of solemnity of this ritual before. After the burial, nine days of\
  \ remembrance follow, where the whole town prays, bands play regional music, people\
  \ gather to eat, drink and cheer with mezcal for our beloved one. Toss religious\
  \ aspects aside, this commemoration is full of a long list of meaningful gestures,\
  \ and among these many customs, one of them hit me the most by total surprise of\
  \ its great simplicity, yet profound and underrated importance.\n\nWhen a person\
  \ has an important life event, like a marriage, a christening, or a funeral, everyone\
  \ invited gives something for the celebrated person. In this case, the entire town\
  \ gets organized and helps with whatever they can, or offer whatever resource they\
  \ have. The family of the deceased don\u2019t pay or do anything during this full\
  \ process, but takes note of exactly what and who gifted them, and whenever someone\
  \ from their town needs it, that moment is when the family repay the favor. This\
  \ is the moral agreement that their society has followed and respected for hundreds\
  \ of years. This is the famous tradition known as Guelaguetza, which comes from\
  \ the Zapotec word Guendaliza\u2019a, and means to give, share, offer a present.\n\
  \nThis is a generous practice that shows the responsiveness and brotherhood of the\
  \ people of this town, but also, that it\u2019s actually possible to support each\
  \ other and create strong bonds between families and communities by cooperation,\
  \ respect and union. I am not from this town, but I left feeling as if I were, with\
  \ my heart full of love and joy despite the circumstances. If this happened to me\
  \ in a small town lost in the south of Mexico, what would happen to our world if\
  \ we could all share this same kind spirit? One might wonder."
