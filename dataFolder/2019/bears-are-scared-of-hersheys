Text: "I\u2019ve always been a geography nerd, collecting random facts about the world.\
  \ Although curiosity in seeing these places fostered my passion for travel, the\
  \ more places I\u2019ve been, the more I\u2019ve come to believe that the best thing\
  \ about travel is the people you meet. I\u2019ve met so many extraordinary people\
  \ on my travels, that I now assume each trip will bring amazing new people into\
  \ my life. A handful of people, however, have turned out to be more wonderful than\
  \ I ever expected\u2026\n\tI sat in a hostel in Juneau, Alaska, passing the evening\
  \ chatting with new friends, when a girl walked in, drawing all eyes toward her\
  \ with an effervescent smile. She was shouldering a backpack bigger then herself\
  \ and looked like goldilocks piggybacking a bear.\n\u201CHeeey,\u201D She said with\
  \ such amiability that I felt like we\u2019d been lifelong friends, \u201CHow are\
  \ you?\u201D\n\u201CGreat thanks.\u201D I replied, \u201CHow are you?\u201D\n\u201C\
  I\u2019m awesome. Let\u2019s cut to it, who are you and what are you doing here?\u201D\
  \n\u201CI\u2019m Davey and I\u2019m writing a book about my travels. What about\
  \ you?\u201D\n\u201CAh super awesome! I\u2019m Hershey and I\u2019m travelling too\
  \ but I don\u2019t feel the need to tell the world about it.\u201D\n\u201CHershey?\
  \ That can\u2019t be your real name, surely!?\u201D\n\u201CWell, no. But if I told\
  \ you my real name you\u2019d have to change it for the book anyways.\u201D\n\u201C\
  Say se\xF1orita, that\u2019s astute.\u201D I said, \u201CI can tell we\u2019re going\
  \ to be friends.\u201D\nIn that brief encounter, I felt the initiation of a strong\
  \ friendship.\n\tThe next day, the two of us joined a local, Brian, for a drive\
  \ out to Burner\u2019s Bay. We drove \u2018up the road\u2019, out of town, to hike\
  \ through bear-infested forests to a beach where whales are often spotted. No roads\
  \ connect Juneau to the rest of world; it\u2019s a city which can only be reached\
  \ by boat or plane. We stopped at a lay-by near the end of the road and began our\
  \ walk. The emerald pines soon loomed around us. Brian chose this moment, entering\
  \ into the gloaming of the forest, to advise us on what to do if we saw a bear.\
  \ There were two possible scenarios: either we saw the bear first, or vice versa.\
  \ If the former, we were to make loud noises and try to startle the bear and make\
  \ it run away. If the latter, we were to stay deadly still and hope it wasn\u2019\
  t hungry. This all felt like pretty poor advice, but he was the expert, so we trusted\
  \ in him.\n\tThe rain beat down upon us as we pressed on. The evergreens gradually\
  \ gave way to a large marshy area, our track morphing into more of a stream. We\
  \ marched on, sodden to the core. Suddenly Brian gave out a tremendous yell.\n\u201C\
  HEEEY BEAR!\u201D\nIt took us a second to realise what was happening but then, across\
  \ the swampy meadow, we saw the bear. Hershey flashed off in hot pursuit yelling\
  \ like a crazed Banzai warrior.\n\u201CYAAAAARRRRGH!!\u201D\nNot to be put to shame,\
  \ I followed her lead, screaming and running top speed towards one of the most feared\
  \ creatures on the continent. By some stroke of luck, our madness was rewarded and\
  \ the bear, fearful for its life, hotfooted it back into the obscurity of the woods,\
  \ presumably off to seek therapy for the trauma we\u2019d inflicted. We stopped\
  \ in a hikers\u2019 lodge on the edge of the meadow and helped ourselves to a bottle\
  \ of wine left on the free food shelf to celebrate our victory.\n\tWe didn\u2019\
  t see any whales in Burner\u2019s Bay, but still considered our little walk in the\
  \ woods a success. It\u2019s not often you come face to face with an apex predator\
  \ and win. But more than that, we\u2019d made friends for life. The next few days\
  \ with Hershey turned into the next few weeks, as we kept finding excuses to continue\
  \ travelling together. Before I knew it, I had a soulmate to share my adventures\
  \ with. I\u2019d come to assume each trip would bring amazing new people into my\
  \ life, but I wasn\u2019t expecting that."
