Text: "I look at my hands and they are almost black from all the dirt. It surprises\
  \ me that as soon as some of them realise we are giving them attention they lay\
  \ down and fall asleep in an instant. I think at some point it is more than seven\
  \ of them surrounding us, jumping around or just relaxing. The people passing are\
  \ glancing at us, we clearly stand out as tourists for one, but also because we\
  \ provide an unusual image of two girls patting and playing with stray dogs in the\
  \ middle of a bus terminal. \nWe arrived at the terminal in the evening, hoping\
  \ a night bus would bring us to our next destination, Mindo. Quito was meant to\
  \ be just a quick stop, passing from one bus company to the other. But after we\
  \ arrived, we realised that there are no buses going to Mindo anymore this late.\
  \ That meant either getting out of the terminal and looking for a cheap hostel at\
  \ 10PM or staying the night at the terminal. So we stayed. It was rather cold, not\
  \ just the temperature, but more so the atmosphere. The terminal had these lights\
  \ that make a hospital look sterile and a police station intimidating, a cold white\
  \ that does not reach all corners. We gave our backpacks to a shop that guards them\
  \ overnight, freeing us from all the things we carried with us day-in day-out even\
  \ though we probably would have only needed a quarter of it all. Walking around\
  \ the terminal, we did what we had always done on this trip, stopping and patting\
  \ the stray dogs we encountered. After a while, a cluster of dogs had assembled\
  \ around us, each one waiting for their time to receive much-needed love.\nThis\
  \ patting session goes on for a while when I look at my hands. They have the shade\
  \ of a dark grey - the dirt of their fur colouring our hands, traces of love. It\
  \ is not the first time this happened. Throughout our journey, we had stopped probably\
  \ for every single stray dog that crossed our way and we did not intend to stop\
  \ this habit even after one 24-hour period were we thought my friend might have\
  \ rabies. Patting these dogs that usually are not even registered by the people\
  \ walking past them treating them just like a plastic bottle at the side of the\
  \ road, you can instantly feel their warmth, their light. They fall asleep because\
  \ this is their moment of rest. Being constantly shoved from one place to another,\
  \ not being able to relax much as well as constantly trying to find food is their\
  \ reality. \nWhen we get tired, we walk with \u2018our\u2019 dogs to the benches\
  \ upstairs where many other people are already ready to spend the night. We find\
  \ two benches we can occupy and five dogs are still with us. I lay down, one dog\
  \ immediately lays down beneath me while another one jumps on my legs. My friend\
  \ becomes the bed of a brother and sister, as we have concluded by their very similar\
  \ looks and them never leaving the other\u2019s side. The last one jumps on my belly,\
  \ rolling itself up on my soft jacket. I fall asleep and only wake up when my friend\
  \ tells me we have to go to the terminal. The dogs are still where they were when\
  \ I closed my eyes. Carefully putting them on the floor, we get our backpacks and\
  \ go to the right gate, only the siblings still behind us. I do not want to enter\
  \ the bus, I fear the look in their eyes when the door closes and for the hundredth\
  \ time, I go over whether I could bring a dog with me knowing all too well that\
  \ it is not possible. The bus driver waves us in, I sigh and take the step onto\
  \ the bus. We sit down and look at them until the bus leaves the terminal and I\
  \ cannot see them anymore. Goodbyes are always the hardest, I think once more and\
  \ close my eyes, following the rhythm of the street, just breathing."
