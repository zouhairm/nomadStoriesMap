Text: "I am sitting in one of the most utterly boring places I have ever been - so\
  \ much so, it would even make it interesting in some sense. It is the Heathrow Central\
  \ bus station smoking area. You see, there is no place for a lost youngster to disappear\
  \ to in this place, other than here. My surroundings perfectly match the grey, overcast\
  \ sky as well as the penetrating stenches of cigarette smoke and car exhausts. I\
  \ will not stay here long, for fear of contracting lung cancer. It is, however,\
  \ somewhat freeing to get a whiff of this rightfully fresh, although mistreated,\
  \ London air. \n\nI ponder over possible adventures I could make for myself. As\
  \ I study the signs around the bus station, my hopes of finding an interesting destination\
  \ are not high. Don't get me wrong, there are plenty of interesting people around\
  \ here. A woman with four small children is sitting facing WH Smith, she looks as\
  \ though a piece of her life might have been sucked straight out of her to create\
  \ them. A man in a yellow jacket who seems to be suffering from an unwanted ability\
  \ to grow a beard walks frantically back and forth, seeming to have something urgently\
  \ poetic on his mind. Perhaps he would benefit from keeping a notebook as I do.\n\
  \nI decide to head to the airport chapel. Not being religious, this location seems\
  \ the least natural for me yet most likely to induce adventure. I walk past the\
  \ busses, through a narrow concrete passage, away from the buzz of travel. I am\
  \ no longer a tourist. I am an explorer. In a strange way, I sense that I may find\
  \ something no-one has seen before me.\n\nThe chapel is preceded by a garden of\
  \ remembrance. I feel mesmerised by this small area designated to peace within a\
  \ complex centred around stress, movement and money. I start to walk around, reading\
  \ some of the memorial plaques.\n\n\"In loving memory of Janette Mitchell, who spent\
  \ her working life since the age of 17 within travel retail at Heathrow. The friends\
  \ she made were her family and this was her home. May she rest in peace\", one reads.\n\
  \nAnother, \"in loving memory of 'Big Phil', died aged thirty-eight. Tragically\
  \ taken away from us during the construction of Terminal 2, sadly missed by his\
  \ family, friends and work colleagues. Rest in peace.\"\n\nSomething strikes me\
  \ that didn't before. The Heathrow bus station smoking area is not boring. Anyone\
  \ who would use such a word to describe it would be pitiful. It's a home. It has\
  \ been built and inhabited by countless beings from all around the world, and the\
  \ only things missing are their stories. \n\nLet me fill you in."
