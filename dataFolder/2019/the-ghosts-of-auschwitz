Text: "Auschwitz. That\u2019s all I have to say for any person to know where I was,\
  \ and why I toured the never-ending corridors. The horrors explain themselves, the\
  \ people will be remembered, and the history shall never be forgotten\u2026\n\n\
  I had prepared myself mentally to shed tears, to feel deep remorse, yet as I stood\
  \ before a pane of glass, a window into time, I felt nothing\u2026 No tears, no\
  \ sorrow, just a blunt knowledge that before me was a pile of hair, hacked off Jewish\
  \ heads. A lowly box of rings resembles thousands of hearts bound together for eternity;\
  \ \u2018in sickness and in health, [\u2026], till death us do part\u2019, and never\
  \ could those innocent people have expected those vows to hold such precise meaning.\
  \ To watch a stranger starve before you is tragic, but to watch your soul partner\
  \ waste away when you cannot help, would destroy your very foundations.\n\nThe pictures\
  \ mean little, a mere snap shot in time, but the objects are so much more, they\
  \ are peoples\u2019 possessions, their lives taken away from them, to render them\
  \ inhuman. Some say identities can never be extinguished, but I disagree; to rob\
  \ a person of their families and friends is to take their supports, their possessions\
  \ hold part of who they are. A person\u2019s appearance is their identity, to distinguish\
  \ a man or woman when they are shaved and emaciated is a hard task. A woman\u2019\
  s elegant features lost in hunger, and a man\u2019s robust structure disintegrates\
  \ when his own body devours muscle.\n                                          \
  \                                                                         _\n\n\
  A couple of days prior to my visit to the camp I was privileged to meet a survivor,\
  \ who was a child at Birkenau. She appeared to be an average elderly woman, nothing\
  \ that screamed survivor, yet even though she spoke in a different tongue to me,\
  \ you could hear the passion and sorrow in her voice. She retold the aftermath of\
  \ the Holocaust, and how she was confined to a hospital. Months later she was sent\
  \ to a school, where she recalled the parents watching her in intrigue and horror\
  \ when she started to play with the other children. Instead of playing the usual\
  \ games, she had rounded the children up in a line and was expertly flicking her\
  \ thumb to the left, or the right. As the children followed their given direction,\
  \ the parents grew concerned at this unusual game, this is because she was copying\
  \ the only father figure she could remember; the Nazi\u2019s. This is what they\
  \ had done when they were deciding whether the Jews would live or die, and there\
  \ in the playground was a young girl performing the same action. She didn\u2019\
  t know how to play\u2026\n                                                     \
  \                                                             _\n\nThe children\u2019\
  s hut in Birkenau work camp was similar to the one that the lady had spent her time\
  \ at Auschwitz in. The exterior was like any other, plain and wooden; but the interior\
  \ was a completely different reality. The adult huts that remained were lined with\
  \ row, upon row of bunk beds designed to hold dozens each. A trench in the middle\
  \ for human excrement is a desperate sight. Yet, after seeing all of the living\
  \ conditions nothing could have prepared me to witness the simple sight of a picture.\
  \ \n\nThe children\u2019s hut had a different feel, a calm and nurturing sense,\
  \ like a school or a nursery. My eyes swept over the hundreds of bunk beds that\
  \ stood opposite each other, styled like a dormitory. I could visualise tiny bodies\
  \ huddled together, their eyes willing for their families return, and their mouths\
  \ chatting to each other like they might be at school. Soon, our tour guide paused,\
  \ and, as my eyes adjusted to the gloomy interior I noticed a painting materializing\
  \ before me on the wall. Little girls and boys cheerfully heading towards what I\
  \ was told to be a school; the sun shining. Our guide informed us that the imprisoned\
  \ adults had tried to comfort the children by painting what their future would be\
  \ like, to give them hope. That painting has been the most prominent display of\
  \ human compassion and resilience that I have ever witnessed. Even without their\
  \ names and belonging; humanity still existed."
