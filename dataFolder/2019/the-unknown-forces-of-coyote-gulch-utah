Text: "The eerie sound of dawn approached us. In the distance the thundering booms\
  \ of the water turning around the goose-necks of the gulch pricked my ears. The\
  \ intense rainfall had ceased, but the remnants remained, yet somehow nature had\
  \ pardoned us. As we snaked our way through the raised river, where only yesterday\
  \ the red powder was itching my nose. Now in its place was an intense concentrate\
  \ of red slit which would engulf our thighs with each leap into the unknown. There\
  \ was no ground to be seen underneath. The backpacks were heavier now and with each\
  \ step we fell deeper and deeper into the vortex of the silt.  No careful balancing\
  \ or stepping stones could save us from this turbulence. The canyon walls towered\
  \ above us, emaciating us in the narrow cove. Fences that were grounded the day\
  \ before had been thrust from its roots. Long grasses and trees were flattened,\
  \ and ones that still remained were trying their hardest not to be submerged.\n\
  The going was tough and fatigue set upon us quickly. Pushing through 11 kilometers\
  \ of muscle pain and shallow breaths was the only chance we had to escape unharmed,\
  \ as tension of another rainfall continued to loom on the horizon. As I was about\
  \ to mentally and physically collapse, we were regurgitated out into the open desert.\
  \ No longer feeling suffocated I released my clinched jaw, but this was no high-five\
  \ moment. We could not locate the next track markers.\n\u201CWas the desert going\
  \ to be just as forgiving to us?\u201D I thought, as we leaped into the unknown\
  \ once again."
