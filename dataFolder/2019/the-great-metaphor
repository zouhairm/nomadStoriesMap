Text: "It took us 7 days, a perilous journey in torrential rains, a flash flood encounter\
  \ followed by a curfew, crossing dozens of impassable roads and rerouting to finally\
  \ reach Leh. We've come to Ladakh with a yearlong supply of stationery & sports\
  \ articles for some neglected schools in the outlying villages. The topography and\
  \ the complex process of obtaining permits to enter these regions prevent any external\
  \ aid from reaching here. Our final destination is elusive; a residential school\
  \ for the children from the erstwhile nomadic tribes on the Indo-China frontiers\
  \ in Koyul. En-route we will cross the world\u2019s highest pass, Umling-la (5.793m).\n\
  \nAfter 8 hours of driving on some freshly baked asphalt and some bone-grinding\
  \ dirt roads, we stopover at Hanle. This village situated at an altitude of 4300m\
  \ faces extreme climate, a lack of all resources including oxygen, water, connectivity,\
  \ and electricity. I almost feel guilty on being presented with a fresh home-made\
  \ birthday cake under these circumstances. Nonetheless, we all revel for a few hours\
  \ before hitting the sack.\n\nOn Day 9, after visiting one school, we had two high\
  \ altitude passes to scale: Photi-la & Umling-la. We spent the morning moving amidst\
  \ snow-covered hairpin turns before we were blocked by a snow-cutter which had broken\
  \ down in our already narrow passage close to Photi-la. At a staggering altitude\
  \ of around 5000m, a stranded army squad advised us to make a detour. It was like\
  \ a needle to my inflated enthusiasm. In that moment of anguish, my energies shifted\
  \ as I witnessed the undefeated spirit of my fellows. The consensus was to take\
  \ this setback with a-pinch-of-salt and a crate of almond milk was popped open to\
  \ raise a toast with the soldiers before we started receding.\n\nA few hours and\
  \ 4 checkpoints later we were driving parallel to the mountain range that divides\
  \ India and China. We drove within a surreal scenery for hours before pulling over\
  \ to grab a quick bite. Glistening copper hue-ed peaks towering expansive grounds\
  \ with breakouts of yellow-green vegetation under a rich blue textured sky, a quiet\
  \ tarn mirroring the whole landscape occasionally disturbed by the activity of magpies\
  \ and therapeutic silence. An inexplicable emotion took over me. After what felt\
  \ like an eternity, I caught myself being moved to tears while soaking this unfathomable\
  \ beauty.\n\nShortly after we resumed, the mountains started decreasing in size\
  \ before unveiling the settlement on the other side. We could see China. We were\
  \ the first travelers in 4 years to reach this check-post. Questions were waiting\
  \ for us. One guard took our permits inside the post while the others enquired us.\
  \ Standing so close to our destination, we excitedly anticipated approval. To our\
  \ utter disbelief, the guard arrived with the news that our permits to go further\
  \ are being canceled as ahead lies a highly sensitive zone. We had traveled more\
  \ than 1200 Km, spent 9 days on harshest terrains & battled grave challenges to\
  \ reach here only to be turned back with a truckload of stationery and sports items.\
  \ After trying all we could, we obeyed the orders and retreated.\n\nDispirited with\
  \ a multitude of unsettled emotions, I watched the gorgeous ombre on the horizon\
  \ while the sun was tucking itself in. Vivid memories from the trip started replacing\
  \ my glum thoughts: the meditative experience of being in this pristine panorama,\
  \ the cathartic drives on the white sand by the ultramarine blue waterbodies, clouds\
  \ hanging like cotton balls from perfect blue skies , sun playing hide and seek\
  \ behind the humongous mountains that changed with turns, the desert , the snow,\
  \ landscapes that could pass for Yeti playgrounds, constellations in the clear night-sky,\
  \ telepathic bonding amongst the group, the celebrations, the bittersweet muscular\
  \ pain, the dopamine, the adrenaline, welcoming smiles of the locals, contagious\
  \ spirit of my friends, the wildlife, racing with notorious Kiangs, tracing silhouettes\
  \ of the mountains in starlight and countless other moments . Memories were mine\
  \ to cherish forever. The journey had changed me on a deeper level one experience\
  \ at a time. I came back learning some significant lessons, one of those being-\
  \ sometimes the journey is all there is and one must fully live what it offers.\
  \ Isn't that the greatest metaphor for life?"
