Text: "For my undergraduate studies, I did my dissertation on political activism in\
  \ Western Sahara. I wanted to carry out field research, so I decided to go to this\
  \ non-self-governing territory in January 2018. Western Sahara was a Spanish colony,\
  \ was invaded by Morocco in 1975 and has been occupied by Moroccan forces ever since.\
  \ There was a war between Morocco, Mauritania and the  Saharawi people until 1979,\
  \ when Mauritania withdrew. Then, the Moroccans and the Saharawi people fought until\
  \ 1991, when there was a ceasefire. The Sahrawi people have lived under occupation\
  \ since then and many activists have not stopped claiming their right to self-determination.\
  \ There is a referendum that still needs to take place. \n\nIt was winter when I\
  \ flew from cloudy, cold London to sunny Agadir. I was slightly scared, but very\
  \ excited! It was my first time travelling in the name of research. When I arrived,\
  \ I was struck y how chaotic it was, with people everywhere screaming in a language\
  \ I could not understand, trying to sell me their goods. Indirectly, and in their\
  \ own way, they were welcoming me to their beautiful country. However, I was aware\
  \ that not everything in that part of the world was as perfect as it seemed, and\
  \ people became very serious when asked about Laayoune. Despite this, I took a 5-hour\
  \ bus there. When I got on the bus, I could somehow already feel the tension between\
  \ Moroccans and the Sahrawi people just sitting there. It hung in the air, a far\
  \ cry from the pleasant aromas of exotic essences and the bright colours of the\
  \ women's clothes. \n\nAt the beginning of the bus ride, nothing unusual happened.\
  \ I managed to fall asleep, and only woke up when someone shouted at me: \u201C\
  Where is your passport?\u201D. I looked at the man before me and, thinking nothing\
  \ of it, showed him my passport. To my surprise, he took my passport and went outside.\
  \ He came back and asked \u201CWhere are you staying? Are you visiting anyone you\
  \ know?\u201D I answered \u201CI am staying at Hotel Nagjir and no, I don\u2019\
  t personally know anyone there\u201D. He looked at me, searching for more information,\
  \ suspicion in his sandy-coloured eyes. He kept my passport and I followed him to\
  \ the front of the bus, where \u201Cthe bus driver will show it to the policemen\
  \ in the next two checkpoints\u201D. He took a picture of my passport and left.\
  \ My heart was pounding by this point, but I took a big breath and returned to my\
  \ seat. \n\nAfter successfully passing the two next checkpoints, I arrived in Laayoune.\
  \ It was early in the morning now. The breeze was lifting my messy hair in random\
  \ directions, as if it were as confused as I felt. I took a taxi and arrived at\
  \ my hotel, which was decorated with grand, antique furniture. Wide-eyed, I was\
  \ taken aback by how beautiful the place was, but my brain was still scanning the\
  \ place for information. \n\u201CGood morning, I reserved a room in the name of\
  \ Lore Maitea Purroy,\u201D I told the receptionist. \n\n\u201CSure, here is the\
  \ key\u201D. \n\u201CAre there any other foreigners in the hotel at the moment?\u201D\
  \ I asked. \n\u201COnly some Russian UN pilots\u201D he answered. \nThe day after,\
  \ I understood why. \n\nI woke up and went down to Reception to ask for my breakfast.\
  \ After eating, I decided to walk around the city. It took me some minutes to clock\
  \ that I was not the only person taking the same route... I was being followed.\
  \ It was a man, who was actually a Moroccan policeman wearing normal clothes. It\
  \ was a clear sign of the precarious situation of this disputed territory. \nAnd\
  \ this was just the first instalment of this fascinating experience, which ended\
  \ in my expulsion for being considered \u201Cnon-grata\u201D, when found to be in\
  \ contact with Sahrawi political activists..."
