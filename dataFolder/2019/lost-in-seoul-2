Text: "I lost myself and got lost in the unknown Seoul. Quite literally and also figuratively.\
  \ By choice but never by coincidence. Successfully but not without fail. In broad\
  \ daylight and under the artificial light of street lamps. \n\n\tAt one in the morning,\
  \ on my first night in Seoul, as I chose to listen to the sounds of summer wind\
  \ and a musician singing in the nearly deserted streets of Hongdae, over the reverberating\
  \ bass calling to me from the crowded clubs. Knowing, a few wrong turns down unfamiliar\
  \ streets later, that getting truly lost in Seoul would be quite the challenge.\n\
  \n\tMultiple attempts were made in Myeongdong. The streets and alleyways there faithful\
  \ copies of each other, lined with cotton candy colored Korean beauty stores. The\
  \ promise of a perfectly stained lip and a K-Pop star in their standee form on each\
  \ corner. The inviting aroma of street food always in the air and guiding towards\
  \ the vendors each and every time.\n\n\tOther attempts were made on hot summer days.\
  \ Following the Cheonggyecheon stream on a quest for antiques and fried squid. Hours\
  \ later and hunger long forgotten, picking a direction at each intersection. Ending\
  \ up back at the Cheonggyecheon stream no matter how many rights, lefts and forwards\
  \ were chosen.\n\n\tGetting lost during the day meant getting lost in the daily\
  \ lives of elderly Koreans as those lives trickled out onto the streets of vibrant\
  \ Eunpyeong, a familiar shop owner's smiling face the perfect greeting. It meant\
  \ getting lost looking up, being blinded by the sun reflected in the glistening\
  \ glass of the skyscrapers in Gangnam. A shop window in Itaewon filled with mismatched\
  \ shoes of all shapes, colors and sizes - a perfect metaphor for the blend of races,\
  \ religions and life stories of the people calling it home.\n\n\tGetting lost at\
  \ night meant streets bathed in bright neon sign lights, and melodies of upbeat\
  \ pop songs or melancholy ballads from the noraebangs located on every corner. It\
  \ meant people watching at Hollys Coffee - open 24 hours and a premium breakup spot\
  \ for young Koreans. Love locks engraved with initials at the base of Namsan Tower,\
  \ the keys long lost or forgotten. Walks across Hangang Bridge and old Hollywood\
  \ movies at an all too familiar coffee house back in Gangnam.\n\n\tAs I lost myself\
  \ in Seoul, I realized the moments in which I tried to get lost in its streets became\
  \ the only memories worth holding onto from my time in the capital of Korea."
