Text: "The day started at the very early morning at Derawan Island, a beautiful island\
  \ at Borneo Island at Indonesia. Me, my  friend that I just met at the trip, and\
  \ 2 of my kind tour guide go to whale shark snorkeling spot. We ride a small speed\
  \ boat and go the sea, the weather are not very good since we are in full moon period.\
  \ Usually also it is the period when the whaleshark are getting married, means we\
  \ have a little hope to meet the whaleshark. \nAfter a half an hour, we arrived\
  \ at the spot. The spot is actually a place where fisherman build a big nets to\
  \ catch small fish. We need to pay certain amount to buy the small fish as bait\
  \ to invite the whaleshark. When we arrived there, fortunatelly there is already\
  \ 2 whalesharks waited us with also other speed boat came to play with this cute\
  \ giant fish. I personally not good in snorkeling, neither my friend too, my friend\
  \ go to water first with my guide and start to have difficulity to breath so he\
  \ came back to the boat. \nMy guide waited me in the water to catch me that already\
  \ scared, the sea are so deep, I could know with just see the dark blue colour,\
  \ I never  do snorkeling at this very deep with a bit wave like this. When I see\
  \ the underwater, some sparkling blue that I don\u2019t what is it was around me,\
  \ guided me into the great whaleshar, I just know after that it was the plankton.\
  \ I grabbed my guide hand and go to the whaleshark, the whaleshark welcomed me with\
  \ long mouth that looked like a smile, made me speechless feeling to met this giant\
  \ cute fish. The whaleshark swim to me and go under me, small fish sticking around\
  \ the whaleshark eat the died skin of the whaleshark. \nThe wave was not so good,\
  \ most of the times I drank the salty water while grab 2 of my guide hand and also\
  \ grab the rope. I am very scared but so curious to see the whaleshark, especially\
  \ see the long mouth that looked like smile. Other tourist go freedive with the\
  \ whaleshark and catch them to the deep see, while I cant really see because it\
  \ is very dark under the water. After an hour, I got back to my boat and say goodbye\
  \ to the shark. The sunrise follow me back to the hotel and bring great experience\
  \ that I would like to share to many people to could also play with this cute giant\
  \ fish."
