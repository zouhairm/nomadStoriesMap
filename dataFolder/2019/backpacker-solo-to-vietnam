Text: "Backpacker Solo to Vietnam \n\n\u2022\tPreparing to travel\n\n     Preparing\
  \ to travel as a Muslim woman, I\u2019m often questioned about my decision to travel\
  \ alone to Vietnam.  Because Vietnam is still an emerging destination for travelers.\
  \  Also not easy to travel alone.\n\nMy 3 keys to travel are:\n1.\tGet permission\
  \ from Husband or my family.\n2.\tMy aim is looking for knowledge and experience\
  \ to write travel book.\n3.\tTo prepare complete documents and  secure budget.\n\
  \nWhat do I look for traveling to Vietnam?\n\nTo make a list tourist place to visit.\
  \ The number one in my list is Ha Long Bay truly unique, a must visit experience,\
  \ also the Mekong River, and an ancient historical sights.  The war museum in Ho\
  \ Chi Minh is high on my list.  Another reason to travel to Vietnam is to enjoy\
  \ the local food and spicy tastes of Vietnamese food. Most of menu Vietnamese I\
  \ wrote in my diary.\n\nHow to find real friends Vietnamese in there?\nBefore I\u2019\
  m going to travel. I sent many request friends on Facebook. After some of them accepting\
  \ my request friend. I messaged them on messenger.  If them response me, I will\
  \ chat them to more real information from local citizen to prove my knowledge about\
  \ their country beside I get information from some  articles or from tourists. Then\
  \ i compared all to got right congclution. \nWhat I did really successful to find\
  \ real friends.  When I met them, they are treated me like a friend not like a tourist.\
  \  It\u2019s super helpful.\n\n\u2022\tIn Vietnam \nAs long as in Vietnam it\u2019\
  s really unique experience like my expectations. \nBefore  to met Vietnamese, because\
  \ we never seen before so I must careful. I have many trick how to find a real friends\
  \ because online friends not all good people who never we meet before. One of my\
  \ trick to find real friends is with asked them to send me their ID card.  \n\n\
  My other trick how to find local friends is with attending free  seminar in their\
  \ city.  It\u2019s make me meet real friends there. And of course friends who want\
  \ to help me. My happiness complete to make connections with local citizen.\n\n\
  And how lucky I am.  As long as in Vietnam, many of them to offered me to visit\
  \ some tourist place. Then they are also paid all my expenses as long as our  journey\
  \ to tourists place.  It\u2019s really make my money save, save, save.\n I really\

  \ head it\u2019s help enough for recognized me as a Muslim.\n\nBefore I ordered\
  \ some food. I usually discuss with waitress. What food I can not to eat.  And once\
  \ again, I said \"I'm very lucky\" because most of them really want to help me to\
  \ get Halal Food. It\u2019s really i got many choices specially seafood and noodles.\n\
