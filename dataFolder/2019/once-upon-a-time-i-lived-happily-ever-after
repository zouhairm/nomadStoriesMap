Text: "Who doesn\u2019t like chocolate? Who doesn\u2019t like beaches? Who doesn\u2019\
  t like both on a hot Summer day? Before you say \u201Cme!\u201D, let me take you\
  \ through a trip down my memory lane. \n\nScrolling through my Instagram feed, I\u2019\
  d never expected to find anything mesmerizing. \u201COh, my friend is getting married,\
  \ yay. Oh, you\u2019re graduating, hooray! Oh, look at that brunch, yum.\u201D However,\
  \ that one day in August 2017, I found something different. A Disney sand art on\
  \ a beach in Ostend, Belgium. Now those who know me know that I have a huge space\
  \ on my heart just for Disney, but to be quite frank, never did I ever heard that\
  \ part of Belgium before. Still, hearing that there\u2019d be Disney AND sand art,\
  \ I booked my return bus ticket almost immediately and off I went.\n\nIt took me\
  \ a good 8 hours bus ride and I got there at 6 in the morning where most people\
  \ and stores were still fast asleep. That gave me a good time to introduce myself\
  \ to the city and strolled around the beach. So, I bid my bus drivers adieu and\
  \ started my journey.\n\nI spent the first 2 hours of my day walking around, saying\
  \ hey to the foreign city. As an architecture student, my eyes then were focused\
  \ on how unique the buildings there are and how special the city planning is. Ostend\
  \ is a relatively small city. However, it\u2019s fair to say that it has everything.\
  \ From casino to seafood restaurant, Ostend has it perfectly packed into one small\
  \ seaside city. Apart from that, from France to the Netherlands, the city is filled\
  \ with both cultures. It was such a unique experience as I took the tram that went\
  \ from the border of the Netherlands all the way to the border of France. How they\
  \ speak different languages within a small group of people amazed me. And that was\
  \ only the first 2 hours. My heart could not wait for the following 12 hours.\n\n\
  Back then, the first two things that came to my mind when they said Belgium were\
  \ still chocolate and waffle. So I made them my second priorities on that one day\
  \ trip, after Disney, to fill my day. Chocolate, of course, was my first destination.\
  \ It turns out that they were not kidding when they said Belgian chocolate is the\
  \ best chocolate. The little local cafe served me with most likely the best hot\
  \ chocolate I\u2019ve ever had in my life. As if it wasn\u2019t enough, I made a\
  \ note in my head to go on more chocolate hunt.\n\nHaving promised myself with some\
  \ pixie dust, I continued my journey to the world of Disney. Perfect chocolate,\
  \ check. Dashing architecture, check. Stunning view, check. And they also have incredibly\
  \ kind people. That\u2019s it, folks. I\u2019m moving. As I was going solo, taking\
  \ pictures was not exactly handy. And language was most definitely a barrier for\
  \ me since I spoke neither of the many languages they had to offer. My apologies\
  \ there. They, however, were nice enough to offer me more than just an additional\
  \ language, but also a hand to take pictures of me and also explained to me what\
  \ was going on in the maze of sand art that I was in. I was stunned. Not just by\
  \ the sand art but also by how friendly people are.\n\nIt did not stop there. My\
  \ trip was finally completed with the best piece of chocolate waffle. So, tasty\
  \ waffle, check. Turning my head to see the harbor deck filled with lots of boats,\
  \ I knew I would have to come back to say hey to them all again one day. It was\
  \ a beautiful experience in a beautiful land and I wished for it to never end.\n\
  \nOh, hey again, bus. Let\u2019s get back to reality."
