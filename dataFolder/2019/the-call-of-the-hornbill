Text: "I\u2019m willing to try most things at least once, but even I chickened out\
  \ when faced with dog curry. No offence to anyone who enjoys a nice spicy dog curry,\
  \ but I wasn\u2019t adventurous enough to find out what it tastes like. Also, I\
  \ kept seeing the surly face of the late lamented Blackie, a stray dog with a penchant\
  \ for nipping the unwary visitor that my sister-in \u2013law had raised. Even though\
  \ my relationship with Blackie had been rather frosty, with studied indifference\
  \ on my side and the occasional snarl on his, I really couldn\u2019t bring myself\
  \ to eat one of his ilk. Moreover, it wouldn\u2019t have been polite to throw up\
  \ in front of a bunch of strangers. But there were many others who were willing\
  \ to try something different. After all, this was the Hornbill Festival in Kohima,\
  \ the capital of Nagaland in India , where you can certainly expect to find the\
  \ unexpected.   \n                  I love to travel ,even though international\
  \ travel can be quite  expensive and you have to battle visa hiccups ,intimidating\
  \ airport security , and navigate  cities where daily average costs tend to make\
  \ a rather large dent in your wallet.My trip to Italy some months back had depleted\
  \ my finances somewhat, so when the opportunity to visit Kohima right next door\
  \ came up, I needed only a little persuasion to make the  road trip to a place that\
  \ wasn\u2019t quite on my bucket list. But when we finally reached Kohima,I was\
  \ pleasantly surprised by the place, ,a hill town much like Shillong, in the neighbouring\
  \ state of Meghalaya. \nKisama  Heritage Village , the venue of the festival , is\
  \ around 12km out of town, and when we reached there around 3pm, the festivities\
  \ were in full swing. We joined the large crowd of  visitors in the amphitheatre\
  \ to take in the traditional dances of the North East of India. Foreign tourists\
  \ were visible in large numbers, most of them part of package groups from Delhi\
  \ or other metros. I have to admit the whole place was extremely colourful and attractive\
  \ and visitors were busy recoding everything in their cellphones. Of course, the\
  \ photography enthusiasts with their sophisticated and bulky  cameras were no less\
  \ visible.\n A stroll up the hill lead us to the various ethnic huts representing\
  \ the different Naga tribes, and my close encounter with aforementioned dog curry.\
  \ Beating a hasty retreat, we went looking for more familiar food, and to our relief\
  \ found a stall selling hot coffee and chicken momos. Ah, this was more like it.\
  \ We wandered around the handicrafts and organic produce exhibits and picked up\
  \ some delicious \u2013looking artisanal pickles and preserves.\nThe nip in the\
  \ air grew pronounced so we sat around one of the campfires, chatting with a group\
  \ of college kids from Bangalore who had come up for the festival and seemed to\
  \ be having a great time. \n\u201CHave you tried the dog curry\u201D, I ask one\
  \ of them.\n\u201CI\u2019m thinking about it,\u201D he replies bravely, though he\
  \ looked pretty apprehensive.\n\u201CForget about him,\u201Dhis friend laughs. \
  \ \u201CHe\u2019s vegetarian.\u201D\nThe Hornbill Festival has made a place for\
  \ itself in the festivals\u2019 calendar, and each year the number of visitors keep\
  \ increasing. On our  morning walk the next day we were pleased to make the acquaintance\
  \ of the handsome and friendly Jacob.I couldn\u2019t resist taking a selfie with\
  \  the golden retriever out walking with its owner. Our last stop before we started\
  \ back home to  Guwahati was the Kohima War Cemetery . We walked across the immaculately\
  \ kept grounds, along row upon row of  headstones ,inscribed with the names  of\
  \ young British soldiers and officers who had lost their lives during WWII, so far\
  \ away from home. It was a sobering reminder of the hard-fought Battle of Kohima\
  \ between British and Japanese troops, and made more poignant by the epitaph on\
  \ the war memorial that resonate even now:\n            When you go home, tell them\
  \ of us and say,\n            For your tomorrow, we gave  our today"
