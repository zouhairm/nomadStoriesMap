Text: "After two weeks in San Cristobal de las Casas, Chiapas, I jumped on a small\
  \ van heading south.  I was on my way to cross over to Guatemala, there was a lake\
  \ I had heard of worth visiting and I had nothing else to do.  I had little money\
  \ left and big hopes for the lake.  \n\nStraight roads surrounded by green mountains,\
  \ humidity was a suffocating air and sweat on my skin.  I was the only one sweating,\
  \ everyone else had adapted and found a more comfortable way for their skins to\
  \ breathe.  The drive was joyful.  I didn't mind the two people pressing against\
  \ me or my knees pressing against the back of the person in front of me.  \n\nI\
  \ arrived to Talisman, a small border town.  Talisman sounds odd considering most\
  \ common town names are either saints or indigenous words. To call it a town is\
  \ generous, it is divided by the highway which is the only connecting road. On both\
  \ sides sit one or two story buildings white or gray, and dirt roads that separate\
  \ these.  Farther behind is the same green earth.  I got to the only hotel and asked\
  \ for their cheapest room.  I never minded hotel rooms while I travel.  The T.V.\
  \ didn\u2019t work, the fan did thank God.  A small soap, a rough towel, a few stains\
  \ on the walls.  The room was fine, I was happy.  I went for a walk.  \n\nThere\
  \ was a church and it was Sunday, which is why the rest was a ghost town.  Outside\
  \ was everyone sitting or standing in what seemed to be a sports court with an old\
  \ basketball board with no hoop.  A pastor was yelling to a microphone with enthusiasm.\
  \  Repentance and gratefulness, nothing new.  I enjoyed this theater for a few minutes\
  \ then walked away.  A couple blocks, nothing more.  Went back to my room somewhat\
  \ hungry.  The kitchen of the hotel was already closed but I had some cookies and\
  \ a soda and was happy.  I wrote on my journal and went to sleep.  I slept easily.\
  \  \n\nNext morning I grabbed my things.  I was carrying two backpacks, I should\
  \ have only took one.  I wrote this in my journal.  Left the keys, paid the room,\
  \ forgot my earphones and started to walk.  It was as hot as the day before.  I\
  \ was told the border was a couple kilometers down.  I walked thirty minutes, then\
  \ an hour, the same nothingness and green.  Heat coming off the road distorting\
  \ reality a few meters ahead.  A truck or a car would drive either way every couple\
  \ of minutes.  Some uphills that would lead to more of the same green.  \n\nI reached\
  \ a small market.  A few cantinas, some food and some clothes.  A sign of a different\
  \ beer brand I didn't see before let me know I had crossed the border and missed\
  \ it, I was in Guatemala already.  No passport stamp, I changed the few pesos I\
  \ had left, drank a cold beer and continued to walk.  \n\nIt was noon.  More uphills\
  \ and heat.  I stopped for a cigarette under a tree.  A young man with a big inverted\
  \ tricycle stopped and handed me a plastic cup with ice cold Horchata.  I told him\
  \ I could not pay, he said it was free.  I don't like Horchata, but it was the best\
  \ in the world.  I hitchhiked.  A young couple in a pickup truck told me to hop\
  \ on the back.  Told them where I was headed and they said I was far.  Then a big\
  \ truck to a small town.  The driver bought me a piece of chicken on a plastic bag,\
  \ that was lunch.  Another cheap hotel room, it was getting dark.  \n\nThe next\
  \ morning a Chicken Bus as the expats call the colorful buses here.  Then another\
  \ small van and finally getting to San Pedro de la Laguna in the afternoon, a small\
  \ hippy town on the lake.  The lake was surreal, getting there was my best connection\
  \ with the unknown yet."
