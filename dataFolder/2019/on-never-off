Text: "Above the deafening sounds of beeping horns and traffic chugging by, it was\
  \ hard to be sure, but I thought I heard someone calling my name. I scanned the\
  \ busy streets, picking through the sea of faces and slowly edged my way along the\
  \ crowded pavement in the direction of where the shouts had originated. Humidity\
  \ made it difficult to move at any speed and the pollution hanging in the air added\
  \ to the sluggishness I felt after a long ride on a cramped minibus. I heard my\
  \ name again and was surprised as I turned to meet my driver: a petite teenage girl\
  \ waving enthusiastically at me from a baby pink scooter. I hesitated as she beckoned\
  \ me to jump on the back but reluctantly clambered on, steadying myself on her bony\
  \ shoulders, before we sped off down the crowded streets of Surat Thani. As we weaved\
  \ in and out of traffic, I fought to keep myself upright as the weight of my bag\
  \ dragged me backwards with each rev of the engine. I clung to my tiny driver, the\
  \ fear only subsiding momentarily as we slowed down but my relief was short-lived,\
  \ as we soon sped up to squeeze through the tiniest space in traffic. I caught sight\
  \ of my reflection in a shop window and couldn\u2019t help but laugh \u2013 my large\
  \ green backpack made me look like a panicked tortoise clinging to a pink roller-skate.\
  \ After the longest 5 minutes, we arrived outside the hostel and I dismounted in\
  \ spectacular fashion due to the jelly that was now my legs.\n\nAs I carefully climbed\
  \ the steps to the hostel, I was greeted by an excitable lady whose name, she informed\
  \ me, was On, never off! She provided tourist information for the hostel and we\
  \ chatted for a while about my plans, On offering to show me around the night market\
  \ later that evening. As well as working at the tourist information desk, she taught\
  \ English to local Thai children and asked if I would like to meet some of them.\
  \ I accepted the offer which much to my horror meant another ride on the back of\
  \ a moped, this time sandwiched between a sweaty driver and my self-appointed tour\
  \ guide, On. She insisted we stop by her house first so we could have lunch as she\
  \ wanted to cook some egg fried rice - considering my position on the moped, I had\
  \ little to no choice. \nEventually we arrived at On\u2019s house down a quiet residential\
  \ street, but not before she had screeched at our taxi driver to pull over at the\
  \ side of a busy road to buy some iced teas and sticky rice from the food cart of\
  \ a tired looking old man. After opening a fortress of locks that secured the gate\
  \ to her property, On welcomed me into her home and we were greeted by two fluffy\
  \ poodles that I fussed over while On set to work on the egg friend rice. Minutes\
  \ later her students arrived, and she introduced me to two boys; the youngest, a\
  \ beaming toddler with a cheeky toothy grin, was accompanied by his 9-year-old brother\
  \ who greeted me politely. The boys were in fact On\u2019s nephews, the eldest of\
  \ which she tutored along with a few other children from the neighbourhood. Sat\
  \ on the cool stone floor of On\u2019s modest house, we enjoyed egg friend rice\
  \ (made with the not so secret ingredient \u2013 tomato ketchup!) washed down with\
  \ iced tea, whilst the boys made animal noises for me to guess, then laughed at\
  \ the English animal names before trying their best to teach me the equivalent in\
  \ Thai. \n\nThat evening as On and I wandered around the crowded night market, she\
  \ pointed out local delicacies and grabbed foods for me to try, including a squishy\
  \ block of dark green jelly - definitely an acquired taste! We talked of her ambition\
  \ to one day set up a small school nearby so that she can continue to teach and\
  \ to offer classes to more children in the community. I asked her if this meant\
  \ she would no longer work in tourist information and her reply was simply \u201C\
  On, never off\u201D."
