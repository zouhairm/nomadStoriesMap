Text: "I truly believe that a big part of my trips is the planning I do before. Choosing\
  \ destinations, deciding the period I will stay in each place, which cities should\
  \ I visit and how to get to them. I start travelling through my researches long\
  \ before I\u2019m on the plane. \n\nEven though was the third time visiting Venice,\
  \ I spent a huge amount of time looking for a place to stay in the city, since I\u2019\
  ve never stayed overnight there. And one thing I love to do when on researching\
  \ mode is to immerse on street view, imagining the routes I could take, especially\
  \ in these labyrinth city. I rejoice the fact that I have a great sense of direction,\
  \ and I normally find my way through cities I have never been before without problem,\
  \ and if a have been to a place before, I stroll around like I\u2019m home. \n\n\
  I was having one of this moments, like I already belong somewhere. It\u2019s been\
  \ a couple weeks for now and I have been in and out of Venice by train so many times\
  \ that I was used to how everything worked and how the train station looked like.\
  \ I was feeling like a resident already.\n\nSo I decided with a friend to spent\
  \ the day at Padova, without planning or time settled to return. At night we took\
  \ a local train back to Venice, the one that stops at every little station. It was\
  \ so dark and we stopped at places we couldn't even understand anymore. But we\u2019\
  re not alarmed, since our stop was the last one. There was no mistake where we should\
  \ get out. \n\nIt was full with young people going to spent the night in another\
  \ city, kids dressed to go out talking loud. And we talked all the way with nothing\
  \ to worry. Until all the lights went out. Just then we realized that the train\
  \ was completely empty at a dark station I didn't recognize. My first thought was\
  \ that there was no way that we have arrived Venice, so probably the train had some\
  \ problem and we should check it out. \n\nAnd then we saw we\u2019re locked inside.\
  \ In a local train. With no restroom. No idea where. With no one around\u2026 \n\
  \nMy friend started to try to break a window while she kept saying we could survive\
  \ eating the cookies we\u2019ve bought in Padova. I tend to rationalize the chaos\
  \ so I started to walk through the entire train looking for the train driver. After\
  \ all, how did he lock up the train without checking everything first?\n\nAfter,\
  \ probably, fifteen minutes (that felt like a lifetime) we saw two workers coming\
  \ out from a building. They heard our screaming and rescued us. After giving us\
  \ a lesson how we\u2019re reckless for not paying attention, that we may have to\
  \ sleep in the train since that was an old one and not easy to open, many workers\
  \ there wouldn't be able to help us. Then I finally asked where we were and he said:\
  \ \u201CVenice. Where were you supposed to get out?\u201D."
