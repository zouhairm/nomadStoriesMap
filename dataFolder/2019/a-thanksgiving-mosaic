Text: "The lights were dimmed, and conversations around the plane were equally subdued,\
  \ with the occasional punctuation of laughter. I sat next to my companion as we\
  \ nibbled on tomato and mozzarella sandwiches\u2014not the most traditional of Thanksgiving\
  \ dinners, but given my family\u2019s ability to make a free turkey dinner seem\
  \ like a punishment, I wasn\u2019t complaining. This year, I had elected to spend\
  \ my holiday exploring Turkey\u2019s Hatay Province, a new destination for both\
  \ of us. The State Department advises Americans not to travel there for any reason;\
  \ my companion\u2019s Foreign Office recommendation was hardly more encouraging.\
  \ Yet, all the Turks that we had spoken to were delighted that we had chosen to\
  \ experience it for ourselves.  As our plane touched down on the tarmac, I wondered\
  \ how our next few days were going to turn out. \n\nNight had fallen while we traveled,\
  \ and clouds veiled the bright, full moon that had previously lit our nighttime\
  \ adventures in Istanbul. My first glimpse of Antakya, Hatay\u2019s capital and\
  \ our home base, was its steel and glass airport that seemed so distant from the\
  \ Byzantine monuments and Ottoman minarets that punctured the skyline of the city\
  \ we had left behind. We collected our bags from the single carousel, and wove our\
  \ way around the buckets set out haphazardly to collect the dripping rainwater on\
  \ our way to the taxi line. The ride into the city was long and dark, but streetlights\
  \ along the way illuminated stone buildings set next to billboards, and groves of\
  \ olive and aromatic citrus trees among the scaffolding of construction projects.\
  \ \n\nThe one thing we agreed on was that we would not consider our trip complete\
  \ without an afternoon at the Hatay Archeological Museum, famed for its collection\
  \ of Hellenistic and Roman mosaics dating back to the 2nd century BC, which had\
  \ been found throughout the region. Upon arrival to the museum the next day, damp\
  \ and spattered with mud from a jaunt to the nearby rock-hewn cave Church of Saint\
  \ Peter, we found the museum closed; it would not reopen until our last day in Antakya.\
  \ \n\nWe revised our plans in the moment. Previously, we had posted online through\
  \ the Couchsurfing organization that we were looking to spend some time with locals;\
  \ while waiting at the local bus stop, we finalized our meet-ups. The first was\
  \ later that evening with a young Turkish Christian woman, who led us along narrow,\
  \ cobblestone streets between windowless buildings to her favorite restaurant, where\
  \ the table groaned under the weight of the meze we shared. Afterwards, we plunged\
  \ fearlessly back into the maze of streets, to relax by the brazier at a local wine\
  \ bar.  The second local we met with was two days later, another young woman, a\
  \ member of the minority Alevi Muslim community, who though had been born and raised\
  \ in Turkey, definitively considered herself to be Arab. With her, we embarked on\
  \ a day-long journey that took us through Harbiye, where locals embraced the home\
  \ of the myth of Apollo and Daphne by selling locally made, organic laurel soap;\
  \ Vak\u0131fl\u0131, the last remaining Armenian village in Turkey; and Samanda\u011F\
  , where we hiked through the Vespasian Tunnel, a Roman-era water channel, and ate\
  \ fresh-caught grilled fish sandwiches on the beach, our toes in the sand and the\
  \ faint echoes of explosions from Syria less than ten miles in the distance.\n\n\
  On our own, we explored Antakya. We strolled through the sprawling markets, tasting\
  \ spices and fruits both familiar and unknown, and sampling drinks made from orchids.\
  \  These we washed down with endless cups of tea, drunk from tulip-shaped glasses\
  \ on delicately painted saucers, Turkish coffee in small porcelain cups with ornate\
  \ brass holders, and the regional specialty dessert k\xFCnefe\u2014shredded pastry\
  \ dough and cheese, soaked in sugar syrup. \n\nFinally, on our last day, we marveled\
  \ at the mosaics on display. As I walked through the museum, I realized that Antakya\
  \ and the rest of Hatay Province is also a mosaic. Each piece is different, but\
  \ vital to the whole. And like a mosaic, each time you gaze upon it, a different\
  \ detail catches your eye, just waiting for the spotlight. I cannot wait to return."
