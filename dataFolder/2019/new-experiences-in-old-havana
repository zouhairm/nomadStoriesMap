Text: "I felt my mother grab my arm and yank me back as a bright pink Oldsmobile shot\
  \ right past me, only a few centimeters from my feet. \n\u201CPay attention!\u201D\
  \ my mother said as we hustled across the busy Havana street.\nI guess getting run\
  \ over by an Oldsmobile in Cuba was not on today\u2019s itinerary. I turned my head\
  \ and watched as the pink Oldsmobile drove off towards the orange Caribbean sunset.\
  \ I wondered if Ernest Hemingway had ever gotten hit by a car in Cuba. \nIt was\
  \ a strange thought, but ever since we had arrived in Havana earlier that day, I\
  \ couldn\u2019t help but be reminded of Hemingway everywhere I looked. I suppose\
  \ it was because Hemingway was my favorite author, and since he was a well-known\
  \ admirer of Cuba, I felt as his spirit was still alive on this island. \nWe were\
  \ in Old Havana, the colonial core of Cuba\u2019s capital. To my right was a medieval\
  \ church. To my left, a busy street crowded with old cars. In front lay a fairly\
  \ modern looking caf\xE9 \u2013 one with a sign that said, in English, \u2018we\
  \ accept Visa\u2019. It felt as if three separate centuries of Havana were coexisting\
  \ only a few yards away from each other. \nWe walked down the wooden cobblestone\
  \ street towards our tour guide Ramon. He was standing underneath an iron-lamppost.\
  \ Right next to him were two Cuban women wearing bright colored traditional dresses.\
  \ You could get a picture with them for $5. \nRamon greeted us warmly, asked if\
  \ we had any questions, and then proceeded to show us around Old Havana.\nWe walked\
  \ past bright colored baroque houses, mystic Banyan trees and little souvenir shops.\n\
  Our entire tour group consisted of Americans. I heard some muffled gasps behind\
  \ me when we walked passed murals of Karl Marx and Che Guevara. As we descended\
  \ deeper into the city, we saw black-and-red flags commemorating the 26th of July\
  \ movement (the communist militia that had overthrown the government).\nIt felt\
  \ strange, perhaps even a little unsettling, to be surrounded by all these flags\
  \ and murals which, to us Americans, were commemorating communists and socialists.\
  \ We were only 90 miles from Florida, and yet it felt as if we were on the other\
  \ side of the world. \nRamon led us down a dark alleyway, and I had to watch my\
  \ step because the crumbling sidewalk was filled with potholes. We were headed towards\
  \ the famous La Bodeguita del Medio bar. \nIn my mind I was expecting a grandeur\
  \ establishment, but instead what I saw was a tiny hole-in-the-wall joint, hidden\
  \ mostly in darkness. The narrow streets around it were crowded with tourists and\
  \ locals. Salsa music was playing from a boombox. A few musicians sitting on the\
  \ curb played their wooden guitars to the rhythm. Men leaned against the old brick\
  \ walls with cold drinks in their hands and cigars in their mouths. Young children\
  \ and stray dogs ran around joyfully. A few excited couples were dancing in the\
  \ center while spectators cheered them on. \nRamon walked around passing out Mojitos.\
  \ He handed me a tall, cold glass with lime and mint floating at the top. \nAlthough\
  \ I admit that I was a little overwhelmed by all the commotion, I suddenly found\
  \ myself at ease when I saw a large mural of Ernest Hemingway to my left. There\
  \ were signatures all over his face, but that didn\u2019t obscure the writers all-too-familiar\
  \ glare. \nI held the cold Mojito in my hand and looked around at all the smiling,\
  \ happy faces. Some people were chatting, some were dancing, others were sitting\
  \ and drinking. \nThe atmosphere here was one of warmth \u2013 and I\u2019m not\
  \ just referring to the humidity. There was this communal feeling of joy and celebration\
  \ in the air. As the sky got darker, the faces got brighter. Ramon told us \u201C\
  sometimes we\u2019ll spend all night drinking and laughing here.\u201D\nI smiled\
  \ and felt as if I understood now why Hemingway had fallen in love with Cuba. This\
  \ island was brimming with life and passion and beauty. I raised my drink to the\
  \ Hemingway mural and made a silent toast to the late author."
