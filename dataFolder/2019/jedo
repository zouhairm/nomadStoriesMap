Text: "Damascene jasmines fluttered into the balcony and tickled Jedo\u2019s wrinkles.\
  \ They were like feathers, plucked gently from a newborn dove and carried from city\
  \ to city by the sleepy Syrian wind. He opened his eyes and inhaled their crisp\
  \ fragrance. He was content, but he quickly remembered he needed something. \u201C\
  Tati!\u201D he called. \u201CBring me my packet of smokers and an ashtray!\u201D\
  \ His seventy-three years of grief were consoled by his twenty-odd smokers a day.\
  \ He couldn\u2019t stop. \u201CWho could stop?\u201D he would say. \u201CA ruined\
  \ ceramic factory, a wife who\u2019s trying to rob me, regrets that I want to forg-.\u201D\
  \ \n\nTati entered the balcony with his packet of smokers and a crystal ashtray.\
  \ \u201CHelp me sit,\u201D he said. She helped him as he rose from his mattress\
  \ and moved into his wilting armchair. \u201CNow bring me some tea,\u201D he said\
  \ dismissively. Tati left the balcony in silence. Each morning he asked for the\
  \ same thing. But Tati hoped that one morning he would ask for something else. Something\
  \ good for him. Perhaps some figs from the garden, some cactus fruit or a bucket\
  \ of cool water to soak his heavy feet in. But this morning, like every morning,\
  \ was no different. Sigh. He flipped open the packet of smokers, let one hang precariously\
  \ between the weak grip of his lips and lit it. Its fumes tended to all his yearnings\
  \ \u2013 hunger, thirst and most of all longing. But it didn\u2019t tend well enough\
  \ the first time, so he would have another and another. And slowly, he eased out\
  \ of his agitation. He exhaled.   \n\nAfter he had his second smoker, Tati entered\
  \ the balcony with a teapot, teacup and teaspoon. She knew not to disturb him sooner.\
  \ \u201CThank you,\u201D he said nicely. She smiled and trotted out. He reached\
  \ to brew his tea and stirred it. Dry pomegranate flowers, lime petals and orange\
  \ leaves whirled around the bottom of his teacup. He took a little sip and then\
  \ paused. It was as though each morning he had forgotten where he was and had to\
  \ charm himself again. He would start by looking at the tiled floor. Black, grey\
  \ and blue lay in a bed of white, embedded here and there with some iridescent mother-of-pearl.\
  \ The tiles glistened, left and right, with the rotating rays of the sun. He raised\
  \ his eyes. French colonial architecture sculpted the balcony rails. The metalwork\
  \ was exquisite. Thin vines grew from each side of the balcony wall. They branched\
  \ out softly, spun inwards and outwards, tightly and loosely, as though in rehearsed\
  \ dance, until they coalesced in the middle of the balcony. Symmetry. His eyes glided\
  \ across the mountains in the distance. The cedar trees scattered across their width\
  \ and height as the sky dipped and climbed their silhouettes. He brought his eyes\
  \ closer. Tall red brick homes faced Mount Bloudan. Their roofs were fitted with\
  \ elegant chimneys and dainty satellite dishes. Their balconies would flower with\
  \ seasonal pots of colour. And their linen curtains would brush the shutters with\
  \ the ebb and flow of the morning breeze, as though to cajole them from their slumber.\
  \ \n\nMore jasmines fluttered into the balcony. He closed his eyes and shuffled\
  \ with gratitude. \u201CAt last,\u201D I thought as I climbed off the windowsill\
  \ and approached the balcony. The netted-door rattled as I slid it open. \u201C\
  Tati?\u201D he asked. \u201CIt\u2019s me,\u201D I replied. He leaned out of his\
  \ armchair. Oh how much he loved me.    \n\n\u201CCome here! Come here!\u201D he\
  \ pleaded. My feet clapped against the tiled floor. I slid my nightdress beneath\
  \ the folds of my knees and kneeled in front of him. I reached for his hand and\
  \ held it in the palms of mine. He prompted his knuckle to my lips. I kissed it,\
  \ tucked my chin into my neck, tapped it on my forehead, then kissed, tucked, tapped,\
  \ kissed, tucked, tapped. Mama and Baba taught us to kiss our grandparents\u2019\
  \ hands like this whenever we would greet them. Jedo didn\u2019t like it. He said\
  \ it made him feel old. But he would let us do it by way of rite. \u201CGood morning\
  \ Jedo,\u201D I said, releasing his hand. \u201CDo you want to play some Tric-Trac?\u201D"
