Text: "\u201CThe future belongs to those who believe in the beauty of their dreams.\u201D\
  \ - Eleanor Roosevelt. One of the strongest sentence I have kept to myself, since\
  \ I promised to believe in making possible my dreams. \n\nWhen I was in college\
  \ forming my career, I tried multiple times to get an internship outside Puerto\
  \ Rico. But still, not even one opportunity showed up at that time. I dedicated\
  \ myself to work hard and gain as much experience as I could in the Advertising/\
  \ Marketing field. Receiving the amazing news that I was graduating with a full\
  \ time job in a advertising agency. And, all of this with just twenty one years.\
  \ \n\nAlways contemplating the idea of doing a master without any clue of how, what,\
  \ when, and where I could do it. One thing I knew for sure, is that my life has\
  \ always wanted to live in Spain but it was an expensive dream. Guess what? Perfect\
  \ opportunity at perfect timing. Here I am living in Spain doing my advertising\
  \ communication\u2019s master and recharging my adventurer soul every day. Not even\
  \ Hurricane Mar\xEDa could stop me. \n\nBeing a puerto rican is growing up hearing\
  \ all kind of stories about where belongs our DNA. Indigenous, american, \xE1frican,\
  \ european, indian, arabic, yes! I got all of that running in my veins. The rhythm,\
  \ the food, the culture, the history just all in one. But Spain, oh my motherland,\
  \ thanks to you I have learned from where I truly belong to. \n\nSurprisingly, two\
  \ andalusians arrive to my live, honored to call them friends. A click to the perfect\
  \ button, the final piece to my puzzle, discovering how amazingly similar we are\
  \ has me astonished. My curious adventurer soul has traveled before, but nothing\
  \ compare to a great evening getting a shot of culture with a cup of coffee on hand\
  \ with them. \n\nIn Puerto Rico, I am the perfect representation of a person from\
  \ the countryside. Living the daily basis loving the agriculture, learning a lot\
  \ from the tourism (I am from Rinc\xF3n, Puerto Rico, Capital of Surfing) and, reflecting\
  \ all of it through the sources I owned of. \n\nIn Spain, is the same representation.\
  \ Just one thing, I came all this long to know that the puerto ricans are the andalusians\
  \ of america. Never aware of my puerto rican accent and the seasoning I put everywhere\
  \ I go untill I got to lived in Spain. From cutting our words, the sayings, the\
  \ culture, our spanish buildings the dialect and the most amazing part, the food.\
  \ Is all just a 85% the same. How great is that? \n\nI did not expect to find so\
  \ soon the other side of the coin getting to know how much Spain runs in my veins.\
  \ Or even how hungry am I to keep travelling and documenting my living experiences.\
  \ \n\nThe magical thing about traveling is digging up till you get to know in what\
  \ point of history connects with your life the culture of that country you are visiting\
  \ at the time. Number one rule: always discover the essence of the city you are\
  \ visiting of. That is the only way we can connect  and learn about a whole new\
  \ person inside of us that we could not even imagine that could exist.\n\nEncouraging\
  \ the \u201CI haven\u2019t been everywhere but is on my list\u201D; currently I\
  \ find myself documenting all my travel stories through my instagram page, travelingkafe.\
  \ Still keep writing on my travel journal the stories that someday I want to write\
  \ down for the world to see.\n\nOne of my biggest main goals is to be a culture\
  \ hunter and get the world to know them. There is so much to discover that words\
  \ could never be capable to express until you let your heart write the experience\
  \ that touched your soul converting the world a whole new attractive that claim\
  \ to your curiosity."
