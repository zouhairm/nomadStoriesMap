Text: "The air was getting thinner as I jogged the steep third kilometer of the Inca\
  \ trail outside Cusco Peru. The dense city-center quickly dissipated as I made my\
  \ way out of the mini metropolis and into the countryside. I planted my left foot\
  \ decidedly to follow a sharp right turn, only to see a dog rear his head. Seconds\
  \ later, I\u2019m sprinting for my life while being chased by a pack of wild Peruvian\
  \ dogs\u2026\n\n\tThe plan was simple - take a year off college, work, save some\
  \ money, and travel. At that point in my life I had never been outside the United\
  \ States and always wanted to improve my Spanish. So eight months into early-twenties\
  \ sabbatical, I found myself in Cusco Pero with my life savings in my pocket, renting\
  \ a room from a kind woman named Laura. Laura is a late-30s mother of two who consistently\
  \ rents a room to participants of a local Spanish language course. When she wasn\u2019\
  t busy preparing pot-luck style dishes for her bi-weekly mass, Laura would check\
  \ on her elderly father who lived in the adjoining house, and we would occasionally\
  \ share a bag of popcorn made daily from the corner grocery.\n\t\n\tAfter completing\
  \ my two-week Spanish course, I had another six weeks to explore. Instead of roaming\
  \ to other Peruvian hot-spots, I decided to stay in Cusco and delve further into\
  \ the local culture. I met a coffee shop owner, Juan, who harvested, roasted, and\
  \ served coffee in his storefront \u201CCafe Perla\u201D, located in the central\
  \ Plaza de Armas in downtown Cuzco. Seeing as I frequented the shop during my two\
  \ week class, Juan and I got to know one another, and he offered me a job - roast\
  \ coffee daily in exchange for a free shift-meal and unlimited caffeinated beverages.\
  \ Needless to say, my 20-year-old self found my dream job.\n\n\tDays consisted of\
  \ opening the shop with the other employees, Graciela and Bruna. I would scrape\
  \ the coffee chaff from inside the roasting machine in preparation for a new day\
  \ of roasting while tourists and locals began to fill the cobble-stoned streets\
  \ of the Plaza de Armas. The slowly browning coffee beans would crackle in the roaster,\
  \ as the aroma of roasted coffee would lure in caffeine addicts.\n\n\tThe daily\
  \ routine of roasting coffee at Cafe Perla was a comfortable blessing. Juan came\
  \ to the shop daily to check on things, and we would talk about the beauty of Cusco\
  \ and things to do in the surrounding areas. He recommended some hiking trials outside\
  \ the city, seeing as how I had mentioned previously my interest in trail running.\
  \ Comfort gave way to boldness as everyday after work I would hike and jog further\
  \ up the trail that led from the center of town and into the rolling hills above\
  \ the city. \n\t\n\tMy second to last day of work, I take my normal jog outside\
  \ the city and decide to go further than I ever had before. I take a sharp turn\
  \ and suddenly wild dogs are barking and chasing me down the trail.\n\n\u201CAyudame!\
  \ Ayudame!\u201D\n\n\u201CHelp Me!\u201D I scream as I barrel down an unknown path,\
  \ clearly in territory not frequented by many, a lost American jogging for his life.\
  \ Eventually I gain enough ground on the pack and jump down a hill to crouch behind\
  \ some bushes. I hold my breath. The dogs approach the part of the trail where I\
  \ diverted. I hear them sniff the ground and consult between themselves and eventually\
  \ they disperse back down the trail. I exhale.\n\tThe descent down the mountainside\
  \ took an hour as I did everything I could to avoid the main trail, and arriving\
  \ back to Cafe Perla never felt so sweet as I sipped a cup of black coffee, savoring\
  \ my health and in-tact body. \n\t\n\tFinding a piece of home in a far-away place\
  \ is inspiring and comforting. Experiencing that human connection despite cultural\
  \ and geographical differences is intoxicating. However, I learned to not expect\
  \ that feeling of comfort to extend down every path while abroad. One sharp right\
  \ turn could could be your last."
