Text: "I had never hitchhiked before. \n\nWhen the beige sedan pulled up beside us,\
  \ gravel crunching as the tires slowed, one of my two friends leaned in and whispered,\
  \ \u201CShould we take this one?\u201D As Americans, we\u2019d heard horror stories.\
  \ Here in Ireland, I felt safe. Perhaps it was reckless, but after 30 minutes of\
  \ waiting in the drizzle, staring at a seemingly abandoned train station across\
  \ the street, I was feeling desperate. We had left the quaint city center of Westport\
  \ and settled in its more industrial section, and I was ready to head back to colorful\
  \ Galway. \n\n\u201CI\u2019m getting in!\u201D I said too aggressively and opened\
  \ the door to the backseat. \n\nGalway was my temporary home for the year while\
  \ I was working on a Master\u2019s degree. At 28, I was seeking adventure that I\
  \ was too timid for during younger years. This particular day had been spent hiking\
  \ up Croagh Patrick, Ireland\u2019s holy mountain. I didn\u2019t learn until I was\
  \ mid-hike just how jagged the terrain was and how steep the climb became. I was\
  \ grateful for the walking stick that locals recommended I rent for the day, and\
  \ the frequent wooly sheep along the trail that made me giggle and calmed my nerves.\
  \ My experience in this luscious, green country was filled with strange coincidences\
  \ and a constant fascination with ancient structures that seemed to pop out of the\
  \ earth without warning. The hike was no different, as my friend Mary Ann from Brooklyn\
  \ met another, decades older, Mary Ann, also originally from Brooklyn, who was on\
  \ the trail. The impossibly white church at the top of the mountain made me question\
  \ modern architecture and my own physical abilities as I learned of the 80-something\
  \ year old priest who climbed up to the structure daily. \n\nThe view from the peak\
  \ was mesmerizing. The surrounding land held patches of multicolored green fields,\
  \ with turquoise water that looked more like Caribbean seas than the Wild Atlantic\
  \ Way. However, the trek back down felt treacherous. My sneakers were no match for\
  \ the unsteady rocks, and as it had started to rain on the descent, I was slipping\
  \ through mud. Despite the pride I felt at the day\u2019s accomplishment, I was\
  \ exhausted. \n\nThe driver was middle aged with slicked back, graying brown hair\
  \ down the nape of his neck. He squinted his eyes as we settled into fading, scratched\
  \ leather seats. We exchanged pleasantries, and I immediately loved the combined\
  \ melodic and barking quality of his voice. I noticed the card on his dashboard\
  \ stating his profession as a cab driver. It read \u201CChris Roberts.\u201D \n\n\
  I couldn\u2019t help but laugh. \u201CAre you off the clock and still picking people\
  \ up out of the kindness of your heart?\u201D\n\n\u201COh, I was always hitchin\u2019\
  \ in my youth too. I figure it\u2019s time I return the favor.\u201D He turned to\
  \ face me in the backseat and winked. \n\nChris had a whooping sort of laugh and\
  \ a hearty appetite for witty banter and storytelling. When we complained about\
  \ the weather, he stopped us.\n\n\u201CIt\u2019s all about perspective, ya know.\
  \ You dream more in the rain.\u201D\n\nAfter we shared our own stories of how we\
  \ ended up in Ireland, he became excited at the prospect of bringing us to new places.\
  \ \n\n\u201CYou know we\u2019re near Ballintubber Abbey. I\u2019m going to drive\
  \ you there to see it! Pierce Brosnan got married there, ya know. It\u2019s only\
  \ ten minutes further off our path if you\u2019re willing? Grand.\u201D \n\nAs we\
  \ neared the historic abbey, the sun reappeared. \u201CThere\u2019s a yearly pilgrimage\
  \ to the mountain that starts over here. This place is special,\u201D  he began.\
  \ \u201CYou can feel it. Sometimes, I just walk around and see where the land leads\
  \ me, and that\u2019s when I feel the spiritual spots. Once I found a patch of wild\
  \ garlic.\u201D  \n\nAs we exited the vehicle, my friend waved and exclaimed, \u201C\
  Have a nice day!\u201D Chris\u2019s booming laugh broke through. \u201CHave a great\
  \ rest of your life, more like!\u201D Then he drove off in a rush. \n\nChris not\
  \ only saved the day, but further shaped my perspective. At first glance, we never\
  \ understand the full extent of magic that is hidden beneath the surface."
