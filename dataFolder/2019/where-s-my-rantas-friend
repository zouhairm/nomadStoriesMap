Text: "\u201CMa\u2019am, please wait\u201D, Hafiz shouted.\n\nGasping for breath,\
  \ I turn back and see a young boy of about 18, dressed in a plaid Kashmiri phiran\
  \ run towards me.\nTrekking on the slopes of the Pir Panjal range in north western\
  \ Kashmir, on the last day of 2018, I was thirsty, famished and drained.\n\nBalancing\
  \ myself in the knee deep snow, wearing rented boots with almost no grip, this lone\
  \ adventure was turning out to be a disaster. I questioned the depth of my decision\
  \ and craved the warmth of home.\n\nHafiz, a local boy noticed my frequent slips\
  \ and falls, and ran to my rescue.\n\n\u201CMa\u2019am, maintaining balance in this\
  \ snow is tough. You should take rest for 5 minutes\u201D.\n\nHe offered his kandil\
  \ to provide warmth, while I sat on the snow, wondering why Hafiz was so glad to\
  \ meet me, or was he smirking at my fitness levels?\n\n\u201CAre you making fun\
  \ of how I fell?\u201D\n\n\u201CNo ma\u2019am, please don\u2019t think like this.\
  \ I am so sorry for smiling like this, while you fall, but\n today is the happiest\
  \ day of my life. Today, I got to know that my dream has come true.\u201D\n\n\u201C\
  Really? What is your dream?\u201D\n\n\u201CI got a letter today. I have been selected\
  \ in the Indian army.\n\nThe village where I grew up, always had military men, their\
  \ uniform, the way they spoke, the car they travelled in, it was so fascinating.\
  \  I have always wanted to wear the uniform. \n\nI am the first in my family to\
  \ get a job in the army.\u201D\n\n\u201CWe have a small party tomorrow to celebrate\
  \ my new job, Ma\u2019am, will you come?\u201D\n\n\u201CDefinitely\u201D\n\nHafiz\u2019\
  s enthusiasm was a refreshing motivation to keep me walking up the slopes. He held\
  \ my hand at critical junctures and appreciated my will to keep going with a \u201C\
  Rantas\u201D at every tricky step which I managed to take without losing balance.\n\
  \nWe spoke at length about his childhood in the valley, his love for Shahrukh Khan\
  \ movies and his desire to visit the Taj Mahal. \n\n\nThe next day, at Hafiz\u2019\
  s house, I was overwhelmed with the warmth and love that his family showered upon\
  \ me. His mother served the local Wazwaan, while I savored each morsel of the delicious\
  \ food and held on to each sweet word being spoken. \n \n\nAfter 1.5 months of being\
  \ back home, one sunny day, I received a Whatsapp message from Hafiz.\nIt was a\
  \ selfie of him in the Indian military uniform. \u201CToday is my first day at work,\
  \ Ma\u2019am. How do I look?\u201D\n\n\u201CRantas  \u201C, I replied. \n\nA couple\
  \ of hours later, while I was busy crunching some data at work, a colleague read\
  \ out the news from her phone, in the most matter of fact way possible. A convoy\
  \ of military men, had been attacked by a suicide bomber. There were casualties,\
  \ but a definite number was not out yet.\n\nI have been trying to call Hafiz, but\
  \ the call always goes unanswered.\nIt has been 2 weeks, since that incident, and\
  \ today I just hope that his phone has been lost, and he is out there, offering\
  \ his hand and enthusiasm to wary trekkers."
