Text: "Having grown up in a tropical country, which only has two seasons, makes my\
  \ children and I long for a winter holiday in Europe. Unlike in the Europe, here\
  \ in my country majority of the people are not celebrating Christmas since many\
  \ of them are non-believers of Christianity. Our desires to experience the hype\
  \ and the beauty of Christmas grew stronger so that we decided to travel to Czech\
  \ Republic and German at the end of the year 2018. \nOur first destination was Prague,\
  \ an artistic city which was so magical for us. We joined the locals to enjoy sunset\
  \ at the cafes near the Charles Bridge, while watching the flocking birds stepping\
  \ on the round piles of woods near the edge of the Vltava River. We went to the\
  \ old town square on the following day where the Christmas market was hold. There,\
  \ we were attracted to try the traditional local food and drink such as \u201CTrdeln\xED\
  k\u201D (a rolled pastry topped with sugar and cinnamon powder, or known more as\
  \ \u201Cchimney cake\u201D), and of course \u201CSva\u0159en\xE9 vino\u201D, or\
  \ \u201CSva\u0159\xE1k (svah-zhawk)\u201D or hot wine. The making of the Trdeln\xED\
  k was so attractive as it was rolled and cooked over the hot coal, and the taste\
  \ was sweet. As for Sva\u0159\xE1k, the strong smell of the spices might attract\
  \ us to look for the source of the smell. We also tried a very delicious Prague\
  \ pork knuckle in one small restaurant. To get more knowledge about the areas near\
  \ Prague, we decided to go to Karlovy Vary. We visited the springs of mineral water\
  \ in Mill Colonnade where we tried to drink the mineral water using a Karlovy Vary\
  \ traditional spa cup or called \u201Cl\xE1ze\u0148sk\xFD poh\xE1rek\u201D in Czech.\
  \ It has a small long spout so that the shape is more like a combination between\
  \ a glass and a teapot but the hole on top is not large so we must drink the water\
  \ from the spout. We also visited Rozhledna Diana in Karlovy Vary, which was also\
  \ famous as Diana Observation Tower. There, we could enjoy the scenery of Karlovy\
  \ Vary covered by the snow, ate the famous traditional duck confit served with dumplings\
  \ and red cabbage and warm ourselves with the Czech Beer.\n Our next destination\
  \ was Nuremberg, which is also famous for its Christkindlesmark (Christmas market).\
  \ I was fascinated by the ancient castle across the central station, which was actually\
  \ near to the Christmas market. The Christmas market was maybe two or three times\
  \ bigger than the one in Prague. There in the Christmas market we tried the Nuremberg\
  \  \u201CGl\xFChwein\u201D  (hot wine), which might taste a little bit stronger\
  \ than Sva\u0159\xE1k. We also tried German pork knuckle at the restaurant near\
  \ Kaiserberg (Imperial Castle). From Nuremberg we went to Munich by train. The Christmas\
  \ market already closed when we arrived. We found out that a lot of restaurants\
  \ and shops also closed during Christmas until December 26th and some of them back\
  \ in business after New Year. However, we still had great time together as family.\
  \ We went to German church on Christmas eve, we spent our time in English Garden,\
  \ bought food from the central station since there were quite variations of food\
  \ to buy and they also still opened during Christmas. Sometimes we brought the food\
  \ back to the hotel and enjoy our family time at the hotel while watching Christmas\
  \ movies. My children also enjoyed playing ice-skating at the ice skating ring located\
  \ near the Marienplatz. We spent for another one and a half day in Munich by going\
  \ around the areas in Marienplatz. My husband and I tried German beer including\
  \ Paulaner Hefe-Weissbbier, which became my favorite so far. Each experience of\
  \ the local food and tradition was so meaningful and unforgettable. The Christmas\
  \ market, snow, Sva\u0159\xE1k, Gl\xFChwein, and beers really gave us the new experience\
  \ of welcoming winter season in Europe."
