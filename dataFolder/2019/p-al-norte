Text: "I had used up all my pesos taking a bus as far north as I could go from that\
  \ unsettling Durango bus station, which I don\u2019t want to get into at this point.\
  \ I left in the early hours and slept through the ride, awakening periodically to\
  \ landscapes of towering peaks and deep shadowed canyons. In no time I arrived in\
  \ Hermosillo, three hours from the border at Nogales. It was still early, and I\
  \ breathed deeply, feeling good that that claustrophobic feeling that had dogged\
  \ me since the canyons was ebbing.\n\nThe highway bypassed the city which sprawled\
  \ out to the west. I gained no impressions of Hermosillo as I passed through, only\
  \ sensations the colour of sand. There was nothing lush or vibrant about this road\
  \ full of un-whitewashed concrete and rusted rebar. There was something solitary\
  \ about it that I welcomed. I didn\u2019t need any more salsa music, or tequila\
  \ or beaches or thrills. Just a few dollars in my pocket, a little love, and enough\
  \ empathy in my heart to live my own free way.\n\nAs I walked, I noticed groups\
  \ of dishevelled looking and road-worn men lining the road. The groups got thicker\
  \ over the next stretch of road. There were 50 or 60 altogether, brown skinned with\
  \ hunched shoulders, some with packs, all with hardened, expressionless faces. I\
  \ stopped to ask one of the men about the gathering. He looked at me a while before\
  \ gesturing to a set of train tracks behind them setting off to the north. I learned\
  \ that these men had travelled from far reaches down south on the steel backs of\
  \ trains, and were waiting for the next leg of the journey that would take them\
  \ closer to the border.\n\nOne swarthy man with sallow cheeks came near and asked\
  \ in ratatat Spanish if I wanted to do some chemo with him. \u2018Esta conmigo\u2019\
  \ said a voice, and I looked down to see a burly young man sitting with his shaved\
  \ head bowed. I said hi, and after a pause, asked him when the train would come.\
  \ About three hours, he replied in an emphatic Los Angeles cholo accent, looking\
  \ straight ahead. I sat with him and we chatted a bit. When I told him I was from\
  \ Canada he exclaimed with pained disbelief. \u2018If I was from Canada I wouldn\u2019\
  t even be here!\u2019 His name was Christian, his family had come illegally to the\
  \ US when he was a baby and grew up there. Nine months ago he was arrested on a\
  \ drug charge and was deported. He had just been released, and was trying for the\
  \ border again. \u2018There\u2019s nothing for me here\u2019 he told me, \u2018\
  what am I going to do if I stay here? This isn\u2019t a life. Hermosillo is a dead\
  \ end\u2019. He had a little backpack with a broken zipper. It wasn\u2019t full\
  \ of clothes, not even a toothbrush. It was full of iTunes gift cards that he was\
  \ going to sell once he crosses. You gotta have resources, he said.\n\nI stuck with\
  \ him to pass the time till the train came. Time dripped by and three hours turned\
  \ into seven and the train still hadn\u2019t come. We listened to my iPod to pass\
  \ the time. Christian looked through all my Calle 13 and all of a sudden he chuckled,\
  \ and shook his head. He had decided to play La Gringa. I listened and laughed as\
  \ well, only half getting the joke.\n\nWe took a nap together at a place in an abandoned\
  \ construction complex close by, but I couldn\u2019t keep my eyes closed. Dark figures\
  \ lurked in those gateways and doorways. I was tired of waiting, and it was time\
  \ for me to move on. I said goodbye to Christian and stepped towards the road alone\
  \ and got picked up in 5 minutes. I looked back at Christian receding behind me.\
  \ I would be at Nogales in 2 hours. The tracks would divert 30 km south of the border\
  \ and head east, and Christian would hop off and walk the rest of the way. If he\
  \ gets caught again in the United States, he could be imprisoned for 10 years."
