Text: "It all started with a monotonous Thursday morning and I had decided to contact\
  \ a friend of mine, Donnachie, suggesting we should go somewhere abroad for a festival,\
  \ somewhere different and unique. Donnachie, always eager to make new memories in\
  \ different places especially when beer and vodka is involved, agreed with me and\
  \ we decided to meet up. \n\nWe were looking online at several festivals, particularly\
  \ in Europe, and we couldn\u2019t agree on which one to go to. That is, until we\
  \ stumbled across a YouTube video about Sziget, a music festival around August time\
  \ in Budapest, Hungary. After watching a few YouTube videos to confirm our opinion,\
  \ we had both come to the conclusion that this was the place for us to visit this\
  \ summer without a doubt.\n\nTwo credit card applications later and a one way flight\
  \ ticket booked, we were heading in the right direction this summer. We were both\
  \ ecstatic, as this was a place we never had been before and we couldn\u2019t wait\
  \ to land in Budapest and party for 6 days straight without a worry in the world.\n\
  \nWe land in Budapest and this place is insane. The first thing I noticed about\
  \ this beautiful city was the sharp and glorious architecture. You can really feel\
  \ the soviet-inspired buildings when you roam the city streets at night. We landed\
  \ around 10pm and the city was still busy with all walks of life doing their own\
  \ thing. Myself and Donnachie finally arrived at the classical Hungaria Hotel Central\
  \ and the place would remain our home for the next 6 nights. \n\nThe next morning,\
  \ me and Donnachie went exploring around the beautiful city of Budapest. Blessed\
  \ with the views and the fine weather, we walked around everywhere. Cutting corners\
  \ and walking through alleyways with the occasional summer breeze hitting us. One\
  \ thing that I will always say is that Budapest is such a youthful city. Modern\
  \ yet historic.\n\n We finally decided to pay a visit to Sziget and have a little\
  \ look around what we could find. This was by far the craziest place that I\u2019\
  d ever been. It was full of life. Full of diversity and characters from a variety\
  \ of countries. It was a real social mix. The first night alone, me and Donnachie\
  \ drank with the Dutch, Germans and the local Hungarians, trading stories while\
  \ teaching each other how to curse in each owns native tongue. \n\nWe left the festival\
  \ and we headed out to a local city pub. I don\u2019t really know what happened\
  \ but me and Donnachie drank beer after beer, and one thing led to another and we\
  \ were in a different pub now, talking to a lovely Greek gentlemen about religion\
  \ and Greek history, awaiting to drink vodka shots.\n\nI remember waking up that\
  \ morning feeling like a train had just hit me. It was one of the worst hangovers\
  \ I had felt but it was definitely a night to remember. \n\nBudapest, was without\
  \ a doubt, one of the best cities I have ever had the chance to visit and I would\
  \ like to return some day, drinking plenty more beer and eating the delicious Hungarian\
  \ cuisine."
