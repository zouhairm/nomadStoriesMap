Text: "A knife, bananas, flashlight, my camera, and change of clothes is what I fill\
  \ my bag with,  \" are you sure you want to come with us?\" Hastings asks with a\
  \ mouth full of food as he begins packing for our trek into the Rain-forest of Tobago.\n\
  \nNot in the slightest, but I am far too driven towards the opportunity to take\
  \ pictures of the (rumored) Rainbow Waterfall than to be swayed by my fear of snakes\
  \ that reside within the forest. Before I am able to give my answer, \"of course\
  \ he is! lets get a move on already!\" is bellowed from behind the house by the\
  \ last member of this rain-forest adventure trio.\n\nHastings and I lock up the\
  \ doors and head towards the path at back of the house to meet Taylor. Before I\
  \ take my first step on this beaten path I glance back behind me to bid a heart\
  \ wrenching  farewell to the warm bed and cooked food I won't be enjoying for the\
  \ next 8 hours. I feel the warmth of the sun rising to graze my back , reassuring\
  \ me that these photos I take will be worth it. we start our journey into the forest\
  \ .\n\nThe sun making its own way through the forest just a few steps after us,\
  \ peaking through the forest canopy and leaving footprints of sunshine on the ground\
  \ behind. Tiptoeing around moving tree roots and ducking from the reach of vines\
  \ that swing too low is little of a price to pay when I took into account that I\
  \ am among the few that has bore witness to the raw and untouched nature of the\
  \ Tobago Rain forest.\n\nA bit more than Halfway through our journey Hastings spotted\
  \ a hollow tree in a ravine that is surrounded by a field of Hibiscus flowers that\
  \ was bustling with life as the flowers were buzzing and moving. We agreed that\
  \ was our spot to eat lunch. Taylor and Hastings pull out sandwiches and cheese\
  \ , I pull out two of the fifteen bananas I had in my bag and we began to eat. \
  \ \" wanna see something?\" Hastings as he flings both peels as far as he could\
  \ into the hibiscus field. It was as if we were facing the ocean, like a wave, hundreds\
  \ of hummingbirds rose and shifted  fluid motion blessing us with all the colours\
  \ of the spectrum before descending back into the field of hibiscus. Hastings and\
  \ Taylor did not care , but I was in awe. We packed up our gear and made way for\
  \ the last stretch of the journey.\n\nThe percussive tune of the waterfall is beginning\
  \ to sound closer and closer as the time goes by, but so do the voices at the top\
  \ of the waterfall. The three of us push some of the bush to the side to reveal\
  \ the top of the waterfall to see where these voices are coming from and one by\
  \ one the voices start to vanish. upon reaching reach the top we see a lady yelling\
  \ excitedly while she jumps into a hole and her yelling begins to fade. eerily,\
  \ we approach the hole where the lady vanished into and without saying a word of\
  \ warning, Taylor jumps in then Hastings two seconds after.  \nScared to the fullest\
  \ extent, I begin to talk myself out of jumping.  I take a deep breath and plunge\
  \ in right after them. During my descent my bag slipped out of my hands and went\
  \ ahead of me , I whip my head up in frustration for dropping my bag and see up\
  \ see a colony of  bats peacefully resting not caring for the visitors passing through.\
  \ \nI come out of the waterfall feeling reborn only to see my bag bobbing up and\
  \ down between Hastings and Taylor \n\nAn underground waterfall runoff is what it\
  \ was, Taylor and Hastings knew this yet withheld this information from me because\
  \ they figured it would be humorous... it was not. Hastings and Taylor curios as\
  \ to why my bag was floating, little did they know bananas float . \n\non our way\
  \ back home, I couldn't help but wonder where the other voices went, I did not bring\
  \ it up"
