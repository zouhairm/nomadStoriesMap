Text: "No safeties, royalties, second-guessing. My decision was bold; rush but definite;\
  \ I was leaving Venezuela to get to Argentina and have a fresh start.\n\nMy last\
  \ week of normalcy before the big leap passed by, I barely notice. Only until I\
  \ was on the taxi to the bus terminal I felt it, that sour hint of sadness. Leaving\
  \ loved ones, hometown, and some plans behind, to never come back\u2026 not anytime\
  \ soon.\n\nA couple of hours passed, the vehicle was late. We were in an overcrowded\
  \ place, no air conditioner, hot mess of weather. A sad predicament echoed around\
  \ us, many emotions at once; anxiety and goodbyes gathering a tearful cloud of pollution;\
  \ it was a scene worthy of an Emmy.\n\nNight\u2019s cloth fell; it was time for\
  \ departure. Hydrated? Check. Focused? Check. Nervous? 120%. Hugged my people, exchanged\
  \ all tenderness and love I could, took a deep breath of confidence into myself\
  \ trying not to break into tears. Without family and close friends accompanying\
  \ me, the start of this journey would have felt like a dive into the abyss.\n\n\
  I didn\u2019t choose Argentina, it picked me.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t easy with the income\
  \ I had, but I manage (with major help from relatives) to accomplish the goal in\
  \ a condensed period of time.\n\nBe confident, work for your dream, then money and\
  \ opportunity will appear.\n\nThe first part was moving from Puerto Ordaz (hometown)\
  \ to Boa Vista, the first city from Brazil\u2019s side, then follow to Manaus.\n\
  Anxious for the view, I was glued to the window, it was beautiful. An angle of my\
  \ country I\u2019ve never seen before. This moving painting struck me like poetry;\
  \ the sky\u2019s spirits touching jungle forest, waterfalls like portals to another\
  \ dimension; stunning nature.\n\nTwo days of bus travel, already at Manaus. I got\
  \ to the home of a multifaceted friend who offered a space to sleep for three days\
  \ till my flight. I experienced bliss during that time; I didn\u2019t have the cash\
  \ to spend on myself. I kept myself entertained while remembering my lack of budget.\
  \ Buenos Aires was ahead, I didn\u2019t change coins at the Brazilian border when\
  \ I should; Bolivares are not international-worth coins, so I was kind of walking\
  \ on thin ice.\n\nThe kindnesses of strangers aid me to get safely to my second\
  \ part of the trip. 29th of August, I arrived during a very cold night of -3\xBA\
  \ degrees, it was Ezeiza\u2019s Airport in Buenos Aires, I was overwhelmed. Almost\
  \ there! I thought, tearfully.\n\nEach individual I met during the journey set a\
  \ scoring point as safe heavens or facilitators to keep myself sane through the\
  \ mess of emotions I had.\nIt wasn\u2019t an easy time for Venezuela, and neither\
  \ for the part of it that came with me.\n\nThe most emotional rollercoaster took\
  \ place through the 30th of August and the 1st of September. Traveling to the terminal\
  \ of Retiro, I felt horrible. Around 36 hours without sleep, fighting hallucinations;\
  \ important things left before getting to my destination: Cordoba. My cousin was\
  \ waiting for me, but I had a problem, my phone stopped working! There was no more\
  \ money left!\n\nI struggled, repeated my initial wrongs from the start, felt obligated\
  \ to find help to communicate, get some place to rest. It was one of the worsts\
  \ days of my life, I let my ego consume me.\n\nEven in the middle of madness and\
  \ self-boycott, the universe sent me angels. I rested at the home of a Peruvian\
  \ lady who offered me a heaven-turned mattress; my cousin sent me a ticket for the\
  \ next day for the slowest -but safe- train ever; setting the third and final part\
  \ of my journey; a 17-hour train trip to Cordoba.\n\nThere\u2019s one way I summed\
  \ up all those unexpected bits of help that came right when I needed them, is what\
  \ we call in Venezuela \u201CUna pata de Gallina\u201D. Without it, my reality of\
  \ today would not have been possible. I learned the lesson of letting the ego go,\
  \ prepare myself to face the truths of the world, and accept the help when I know\
  \ I can\u2019t do it all alone."
