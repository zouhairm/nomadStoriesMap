Text: "The sun rays beaming upon my skin, I stood on a collection of small rocks at\
  \ the Nudista beach looking out into the glistening Mediterranean Sea. The laughs\
  \ and conversation of nude locals accompanied the majestic views of the rocky cliffs\
  \ hidden away from the main road. Without a trace of pollution, trash nor tar, I\
  \ felt the healing energy in the air. \nWith excitement, I ran into the clear water,\
  \ parting with my towel and notebook. With my swim suit and curious eyes, I swam\
  \ to discover a boulder, a mini island with a few people climbing and leaping off\
  \ of it. I knew they were locals with their passionate way of communicating and\
  \ vivacious spirit. My eyes burned as I grabbed an edge at the bottom. Without a\
  \ second thought, I began climbing, which seemed quite simple. One step up to another,\
  \ I looked to the next sharp edge of support. \nOut of breathe with bloody scrapes\
  \ on my wrists and knees; I made it to the top. For a moment stood proud knowing\
  \ I conquered the boulder and joined the locals.   \nOnce I looked down, a short\
  \ panic set in, wondering how to climb back down. Climbing down wasn\u2019t an option.\
  \ It\u2019s a leap. In an instant, out of my comfort zone, the fear and insecurities\
  \ roared. How could I leap all the way down with all the rocks cuddling the perimeter?\n\
  Chatter in the mind ignited the adrenaline. Why did I climb fearlessly? Will I hit\
  \ the sharp rocks if I don\u2019t jump strong enough? I observed the few locals\
  \ jump, laugh, and repeat. How can it be so easy? I had to take action as the blazing\
  \ sun was scorching my skin and the discomfort grew.\nThe more focus I gave to the\
  \ rocks, the more difficult it appeared. I had a flashback of my bold conviction\
  \ when I delivered a resignation letter leaving my office job to experience the\
  \ unknown. Suddenly, my intuition took over. An immediate decision to shift my eyes\
  \ onto the vast water ambushed the fear. I was overcome with trust in my ability.\
  \  I took the leap. In less than 3 seconds, the splash of joy and laughter was worth\
  \ the discomfort.\nThis happens every day to all of us. Small changes in perspective\
  \ can take a challenge and make it into a memorable experience. I swam to an open\
  \ spot and floated with my eyes glued to the sky taking the timeless experience.\
  \ \nExperiences can be life changing as long as you\u2019re open to it. Befriending\
  \ intuitive guides spirit to take leaps to experience the thrills in life. Trust\
  \ and love are the magical forces that will take care of you."
