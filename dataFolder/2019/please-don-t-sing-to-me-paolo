Text: "So let\u2019s start this off with a spicy lil pop quiz for y\u2019all.\n\n\
  The best part of a travel adventure is:\n\nThe chance to taste the local cuisine\n\
  The chance to see beautiful new views\nThe chance to land yourself a fine new piece\
  \ of foreign a$$ \n\nTo all y\u2019all who picked C, I\u2019m glad to see you have\
  \ your priorities straight.\n\nAnonymity is the beautiful thing about traveling,\
  \ especially solo; no one has any idea who the hell you are, so you\u2019re completely\
  \ free to go about doing things that you might not be doing back home *cue the Cheers\
  \ theme song* where everybody knows your name. \n\nMy go-to fake name back home,\
  \ Sarah (for when I go to Starbucks and don\u2019t want to spend the extra 30 seconds\
  \ trying to tell the barista how to spell Dharma\u2014 that\u2019s with a silent\
  \ h!) became the basis for my new identity. Sarah was a confident. Sarah was cool,\
  \ calm, and collected. Sarah was a badass bitch who could strut her way into a bakery\
  \ and order her sfogliatelle in broken-ass Italian and not bat an eyelash when the\
  \ cashier asked three times to repeat the order because she could barely understand\
  \ my bastardized \u201Csfogliatelle\u201D and \u201Ct\xE8.\u201D \n\nSarah\u2019\
  s confidence also got her into trouble.\n\nAs I was sipping on that (far too milky)\
  \ tea and scrolling through instagram with the free cafe wifi, something quite magical\
  \ happened\u2014 a very tall, tanned, handsome something. He asked if anyone was\
  \ sitting across from me, and I said no. Instead of taking the chair away to sit\
  \ at another table like I thought he would, the tall cup of Italian white hot chocolate\
  \ popped a squat right there! He said he heard me struggling to order and wanted\
  \ to know where I was from. He laughed when I said I was from Toronto, because for\
  \ someone native to that quaint town of Mandriole, the idea of a bustling, dirty\
  \ North American city was as foreign to him as pasta for breakfast was to me. He\
  \ was the Paolo to my Lizzie McGuire and before I knew it, he was inviting me out\
  \ that night and I was trying to hide my overbearing excitement with a coy smile\
  \ and a casual \u201Cyes.\u201D\n\nAfter fretting for far too long about how to\
  \ somehow make a cute outfit from what little clothes I packed in my carry-on, Paolo\
  \ picked me up on the back of his motorbike and we were speeding off towards the\
  \ coast. \n\nWe practiced our language skills on each other while I chowed down\
  \ on the best ravioli I\u2019ve ever had. We talked about why the hell there are\
  \ two countries inside of Italy (a whole other mess). We shared gelato for dessert\
  \ and kissed the night away with the sand beneath our feet and stars above our heads\
  \ on the beach.\n\nDrunk on romance and wine, I asked if he wanted to head back\
  \ to his place (I deeply suspected my host family would be uncomfortable with a\
  \ drop-in visitor at midnight). We sped back towards town and he showed me to his\
  \ little yellow walkup on the water\u2019s edge. \n\nThe freak was about to get\
  \ on when I got to his bedroom\u2014 and damn near walked right back out. It wasn\u2019\
  t a messy room or an unmade bed that shook me, but rather the whole ass woman in\
  \ a nightgown in the bed. \n\nWhen asked just what the hell was going on, Paolo\
  \ looked at me in confusion and said in what would have been an instance of endearing\
  \ confusion if he hadn\u2019t just messed all the way up: \u201CThat is how I do.\u201D\
  \n\nThat is how I do. \n\nWell, Paolo, that is definitely not how Sarah do, which\
  \ I promptly informed him of before I made the 1:00am trek across town back home,\
  \ \n\nSo my childhood dream had come true: I really had found the Paolo to my Lizzie;\
  \ it\u2019s just that I had my sing to me, Paolo moment in reverse and I got the\
  \ dramatic reveal.\n\nSarah\u2019s a freak with standards, Paolo; drop the bitch\
  \ in the towel and let\u2019s try this again sometime."
