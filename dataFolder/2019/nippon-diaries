Text: "An attraction to all things Japanese has been one of the most abiding features\
  \ of my life. Right from my 'otaku'-flavoured childhood to my current Japanese product-cluttered\
  \ home, I have always felt an unnatural sense of belonging to this distant and mystical\
  \ country.\n\nEven as far back as a decade (when I hadn\u2019t even visited Japan),\
  \ I remember catching the attention of my cousin\u2019s Japanese friends who had\
  \ travelled down to India for his wedding. To them, I resembled a famous cartoon\
  \ character from back home. At first I was mildly amused, but then gradually got\
  \ thrilled thinking about my likeness existing somewhere in the vast labyrinthine\
  \ worlds of 'manga' comic-dom, giving pleasure to its legions of fans from 6 to\
  \ 60 years of age. My one-way love for Japan had suddenly morphed into a two-way\
  \ street. My happiness couldn\u2019t be contained! I decided there and then that\
  \ it was time to finally take the leap and experience the land to which I had felt\
  \ attracted for over 20 years and across 6000 kilometers!\n\nAnd if you had any\
  \ doubts as to the veracity of my story above, I\u2019ll have you know that as soon\
  \ as I landed at Narita Airport, I was interviewed by not one but two different\
  \ TV camera crews! They wanted to know my reasons for visiting Japan, and I happily\
  \ blabbered away, ecstatic at being sought for my views like a celebrity traveller!\n\
  \nPost this heady welcome, I proceeded to use the washroom at the airport where\
  \ another surprise was awaiting me: the legendary Japanese attention-to-detail.\
  \ As soon as I entered, I could scarcely believe my eyes! An LCD screen coupled\
  \ with a massive control panel offered varying levels of water pressure, flow rate,\
  \ seat heating and whatnot \u2013 all for a customised posterior-washing experience!\
  \ The geek inside me was overwhelmed! In the very first few hours itself, Japan\
  \ had come alive to me (literally and figuratively) as an anal nerd\u2019s paradise.\n\
  \nAll throughout my travels across Tokyo city and Hokkaido prefecture in the subsequent\
  \ days, it was the Japanese people who stood out to me the most. The politest, one-of-a-kind\
  \ people in the world who put order and etiquette above everything else, possessing\
  \ an astounding sense to create space where none exists, and doing it beautifully.\
  \ Their petite statures belie their big hearts - from the train station employee\
  \ who immediately refunded my money for a hastily and wrongly bought ticket, to\
  \ the young lady returning from office who gladly put her bags down and sketched\
  \ out a map for me using only a tissue and her eyeliner. Each day is 'kaizen' for\
  \ them, from the biggest CEO down to those visual artists who slog everyday to fulfill\
  \ the myriad fantasies of this comic and anime-crazy land. And what to say (that\
  \ hasn\u2019t already been said) of their food? Innumerable, delicately laid-out,\
  \ small plates that entice you at first, but then your eyes (and stomach) keep getting\
  \ bigger as the courses keep on coming and the banter and 'sake' keep on flowing\
  \ late into the night.\n\nTo understand Japan is to understand that it exists in\
  \ a binary for any visitor. Detached yet intimate. Welcoming yet non-interfering.\
  \ Mystical yet imbued with the most gracious human qualities. For the modern-day\
  \ traveller, that is the perfect kind of culture to visit, understand, mingle and\
  \ celebrate."
