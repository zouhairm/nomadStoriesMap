Text: "There were no bright lights or overwhelming sky scrapers, no famous monuments\
  \ or museums; instead there were trees that reached for the sky and water as calm\
  \ as a bowl of holy water not yet broken for blessings. Our rookie paddle strokes\
  \ clumsily entered the water with splashes that broke the silence we were so desperately\
  \ trying not to disturb. \n\nTo any of us 8 rookies, the landscape of these over\
  \ 100 islands all appeared quite similar; trees, beaches, and cliffs surrounded\
  \ by more water than you could imagine. But to our guides Frank and Jesse every\
  \ turn we took had purpose; to lead us to a special inlet, or traverse of trees\
  \ that told a story, that had substance beyond just their physical nature. We learnt\
  \ stories of how the Tseshaht First Nation worked with the unique features of each\
  \ island to fish, hunt, and to build a home. This fascinating group of people worked\
  \ with nature not against it, to establish and sustain the land in which they found\
  \ life in. To anyone that did not know, you would assume this group of islands had\
  \ been untouched, as very little evidence of previous human life existed. However,\
  \ with a little education from our guides our unknowing eyes began to uncover the\
  \ clues that indicated previous life, one being the bays with cleverly crafted collections\
  \ of sticks that were used to quietly capture fish.\n\nAs we \u2018parked\u2019\
  \ our kayaks along the shore of one of the islands to have lunch, I found myself\
  \ making every effort to reduce my impact. Watching each step I took as to not crush\
  \ what was living, observing and respecting its place in this wonderful habitat.\
  \  With increased awareness I attempted to absorb the surroundings from all angles,\
  \ to not just look up, but to also look down, to look right, and to look left. The\
  \ guidance of Frank and Jesse helped to steer my gaze, as their depth of knowledge\
  \ added substance to each new sighting. The bald eagle nesting in the trees was\
  \ so much more than a bird as we learnt of their famous courtship free wall ritual,\
  \ in which two bald eagles fly up high, lock talons, and cartwheel spin toward the\
  \ ground together breaking apart at the last minute.  An amazing fact that re-solidified\
  \ my fear of birds, and made me realize just how tame being a human really is. Although,\
  \ I never plan to sign myself up for a freefall courtship ritual, and will stick\
  \ to the safety of a bed. \n\nThis was just one of the instances in the approximately\
  \ 8 hours spent amongst the islands that I realized just how small a part in the\
  \ world I play. For so many years I had sought out the \u2018busy life,\u2019 overrun\
  \ with noise and hustle, as it felt fuller to me. Quiet felt empty and limited,\
  \ but as I floated amongst the calm I realized just how full the quiet could be.\
  \ That so many times layers of stories existed beneath the quiet exterior, and that\
  \ it just took time and interest to uncover them. \n\nThanks to Frank and Jesse\
  \ and the Broken Group Islands I began to re discover the life I longed for. A life\
  \ guided gently by my surroundings, with less force, and more freedom. This experience\
  \ guided me back to my original values, my love for nature, and my longing for calm.\
  \ Floating in my kayak gliding through the water, I found so much more than nature\
  \ and adventure, I found my sense of calm.  And in that calm, I found peace; something\
  \ that had been lost to me for so long."
