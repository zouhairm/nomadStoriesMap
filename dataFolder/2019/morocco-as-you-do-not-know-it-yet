Text: 'Living in Morocco for 8 years after 3 years in Madagascar, i am a french guy
  who ended up in hospitality through my travel.

  Learning arabic from my first days in Marrakech, it gave me opportunity to meet
  people in countryside.

  A few years ago, driving in the middle of fields to access to the Ocean I start
  walking to the beach and an old man came to me.

  After a tea in his tiny hut, I went to walk on this isolated sand beach.

  On my way back to the car, he was with a big box of his vegetable production.

  Could not even give him some of the home made biscuit I was travelling with.

  At night, back to the place I run in Marrakech, my team enjoyed those fresh vegetable
  and we shared the best couscous ever the day after.

  Morocco give a feeling of fake country to so many people coming to ChefChaouen,
  Marrakech, DesertCamp and no more...

  Once you go away from the main cities focused on tourism as the main ressource you
  can have true experiences.

  This one was my first experience in whole arabic speaking during my travel time,
  now for years I have opportunity to meet people and share a real deep moment of
  cultural exchange.

  In conclusion, I would say that after those years here, it is usually through children
  I met the most impressive ladies having hours talking with them about their life
  and their point of view of what western life is.'
