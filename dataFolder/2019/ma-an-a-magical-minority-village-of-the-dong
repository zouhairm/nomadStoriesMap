Text: "For our third day in the Southern province Guizhou, we have planned a very\
  \ special trip: We want to visit a village of the Dong minority, one of the 56 official\
  \ minorities in China that hardly any Westerner knows about. In total there are\
  \ about 3 million Dong in Southern China (most of them in Guizhou, but also in parts\
  \ of Vietnam). They are known for their carpentry skills and their polyphonic choral\
  \ singing. We hope to experience both with our own eyes and ears today.\n\nArriving\
  \ at the Sanjiang train station, we are greeted by a bunch of private taxi drivers\
  \ who shower us with special offers. We choose the driver whose sign appears to\
  \ us as the most reliable and informative. And we could hardly have made a better\
  \ choice \u2013 it turns out that he himself belongs to the Dong minority and thus\
  \ can provide us with first-hand information! \n\nEven from a few miles afar, sitting\
  \ in the taxi, we can already admire the traditional \"wind and rain bridge\", the\
  \ entrance portal to the village, in its entire length. It\u2019s a typical example\
  \ of the Dong's traditional carpentry, characterized by its filigree and complex\
  \ structures (Ma`an`s wind and rain bridge has been held together by wooden nails\
  \ for at least 100 years!). Making our way towards the entrance to the village,\
  \ we notice some locals dressed in traditional clothing who greet each visitor with\
  \ a special ritual. \n\nCarefully, I approach the welcome committee. I am served\
  \ a small glass of clear liquor (the traditional Chinese Baijiu), listen in amazement\
  \ to the polyphonic choral singing of the locals and, after leaving a small donation\
  \ in a basket, I am finally allowed to set foot on the bridge. A feeling of awe\
  \ and deep emotion comes over me, as if I had just participated in a magical initiation\
  \ ritual that has opened the portal to a very special place. \n\nMeanwhile, my travel\
  \ companion has already run ahead and chats with our guide about the daily life\
  \ in the village. The Dong minority celebrates not only the traditional Chinese\
  \ festivals, but also dozens of their own festivities \u2013 for example, the \"\
  day on which the first rice is harvested\" and the \"day on which the water buffaloes\
  \ are washed\". And there are some celebrations that focus on singing together,\
  \ including the absolutely weird and grand \"feast for lovers who were struck by\
  \ lightning\". Fortunately, there is no evidence of a disproportionately high number\
  \ of lovers in rural southern China who suffer such a fate.\n\nWe continue our walk\
  \ through the village towards the \"Drum Tower\", the traditional gathering place\
  \ of the locals. Inside the \"Drum Tower\" \u2013 another architectural achievement\
  \ of the Dong \u2013 a few old men sit and watch television. \"This is a TV version\
  \ of the famous Buddhist classic Journey to the West,\" my travel companion recognizes\
  \ immediately. Travel to distant western lands \u2013 for those old villagers probably\
  \ an unfulfilled dream.\n\nBut are the members of the Dong minority really Buddhists?\
  \ Not quite - elements of Buddhism (and Daoism) are included in their beliefs, but\
  \ traditionally, the Dong are followers of animism. According to their belief, all\
  \ things are animated - including rocks, rice seeds and even bridges. Followers\
  \ of such beliefs are usually very prone to superstition and adhere to a long list\
  \ of taboos. Magic and shamanism are also practiced, as well as voodoo - which,\
  \ to my surprise, is relatively common throughout China.\n\nWe end the day in a\
  \ small \"tea house\". The wooden table, carved from a tree root, with curves and\
  \ corners on which we can rest our small green tea bowls, immediately attracts my\
  \ attention. Speaking of wood \u2013 what about the wooden beaded bracelet our tour\
  \ guide is wearing? \"This is a gift, a good luck charm. The wooden balls change\
  \ their color the longer you wear them. It's becoming more and more a part of you.\
  \ But you can only get it as a gift from someone, not buy it.\"\n\nThat reminds\
  \ me of a Chinese proverb: \u53EF \u9047 \u4E0D\u53EF \u6C42. There are things you\
  \ can only come by by accident or fate, but cannot actively search for. Just like\
  \ today`s travel experience."
