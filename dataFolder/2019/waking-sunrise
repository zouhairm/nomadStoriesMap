Text: "There are twenty or so men stood at the door, jostling for position. For a\
  \ few awkward and comical moments I look between the faces of the strangers, all\
  \ claiming to be my taxi driver, and hesitate; not sure which one to believe. Then,\
  \ to my relief, I spot a young man stood in the middle of the crowd, not shouting\
  \ like the other men, but waiting quietly and holding a small piece of plain A4\
  \ paper that says \u2018LAWRENCE\u2019. We rush off into the storm outside, where\
  \ a tall man with a moustache, a beanie hat and a large toothy grin, leans on a\
  \ 4x4. He puts my bags in the boot and I hop into the backseat, and feeling a mixture\
  \ of excitement, anticipation and disorientation, we begin our long drive back to\
  \ the city of Makeni.\nAt first we crawl along a pitch black dusty lane at 10mph\
  \ peppered with potholes. I am thrown around the 4x4 like a rag doll as the headlights\
  \ shine light on eerie looking shacks in the distance. We then reach a long, smoother\
  \ tarmac road, and I temporarily drift off to sleep. I snooze until my head clanks\
  \ against the window hard enough for me to realise that the sun has started rising,\
  \ and I am able to see Sierra Leone\u2019s landscape for the first time. I eagerly\
  \ peer out to see a blur of green on either side of the tarmac. Beyond that, beautiful,\
  \ vast, green jungle fills up either side of us; with the near two to three metre\
  \ high green grass pushing its way into the road as far as the cars allow it. Hundreds\
  \ of palm trees soar above us and off in both directions into the distance, silhouetting\
  \ against the low orange-pink glow of sunrise that is slowly forming. Small hills\
  \ covered in a carpet of green life pop up here and there in the distance, with\
  \ a low lying tropical mist surrounding them.\nThe driver ploughs on at a constant\
  \ speed with upbeat \u2018Salone\u2019 music pumping out from the radio \u2013 a\
  \ blend of dance, hip hop and pop. The variety of drum beats and basslines bounces\
  \ us happily on our way to the city, and I feel a pang of exhilaration. Within minutes\
  \ of watching my new world, wide-eyed, I begin to notice small towns and villages\
  \ appearing. People walk along the side the road balancing baskets of goods on their\
  \ heads while stray dogs dart across the road. Small wooden shacks and battered\
  \ concrete buildings of a variety of painted colours are dotted here and there,\
  \ with locals peering out at the jeep as we zoom past them.\nOnce we make it to\
  \ the city perimeter, daily life has begun. The small villages begin to turn into\
  \ one vast sweeping labyrinth of mayhem; dozens of people fill both sides of the\
  \ road and little shops and markets plug every square inch in sight. All of a sudden\
  \ there is too much to observe without feeling overwhelmed. A full palette of bright\
  \ colours flies past my window in a blur: multi-coloured fabric designs on ladies\
  \ dresses and children in their school uniforms - bright yellows, greens and blues\
  \ contrasting against their dark skin and hair. I open my window slightly and a\
  \ warm sticky breeze enters my nostrils; tropical air filling my lungs.\nThe variety\
  \ of life buzzing and flowing around the main road is electrifying, and as we hit\
  \ the city centre, another surge of energy, chaos and life traffic appear. The intensity\
  \ of Makeni has now been dialled up to 100%. The thick moist humidity begins to\
  \ intensify with the rising sun and a unique wave of stimulation hits my senses.\
  \ Colourful items at market stalls, music blaring from speakers, motorbikes buzzing\
  \ past, smells of beans and various sauces from morning stoves. I want to reach\
  \ out the window with both arms and grab the moment in my hands, capturing the feeling\
  \ of surprised delight, and put it in a box. My curiosity of culture is being answered\
  \ emphatically, and I am able to observe; beginning to feel slightly culture-shocked,\
  \ the surroundings of my new home."
