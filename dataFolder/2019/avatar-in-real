Text: "It was 10 O\u2019clock P:M when I received a message from a friend through\
  \ messenger asking  How is life? We talked for long. He said  why you are so conservative\
  \ ? and never think of traveling abroad?  I laughed  as it was a joke , never took\
  \ it seriously. But he sent me a link to apply said: I am sure you will get the\
  \ chance , It took long for me to decide because, it was my first time thinking\
  \ of leaving my comfort zone to leap into the Unknown,  I gather my power and took\
  \ a deep breath then I started to navigate the link ,  I was looking to the pictures\
  \ going through  participants experience,  I felt that I am in to that , Finally,\
  \ I applied. I have been asked to go through 24th episodes and questions to answer\
  \ most was about Inner peace, with time I really was eager to get to know more \
  \ , day by day I have  finished all episodes and I was asked to do a project to\
  \ conduct a meditation session in my community.  It was something strange and new\
  \ but that was really awesome and people whom I conducted with was satisfied and\
  \ happy with it .one day,  I got the acceptance to be a participant in this revolution\
  \ of peace which will take place in Thailand. I was like dreaming I couldn't believe\
  \ the email I received from them I was reading  this many times but I stopped thinking\
  \ of my situation and how I will convince my father to let me go alone . But I decided\
  \ that I will not give up I have to reach my goal .speaking to myself :  Reham this\
  \ is Thailand you have to fight . I  talked to father as I expected he got shocked\
  \ and refused to speak with me for a day but finally he give me the permission at\
  \ that time I felt that I become responsible of my decisions I have made and fully\
  \ happy , The Adventure starts ,The day of traveling came , My eyes could be closed\
  \ all thoughts comes to my mind ,about places , people Whom I  will meet, everything\
  \ even on how I could exchange the rate of the currency .Finally I reached Thailand\
  \ , Bangkok. every thing was different comparing to  my country , people were kind\
  \ and smiley , Airport clean and tidy as well as hug I didn't know what to do I\
  \ was feeling lost ,just following people  to reach to the  arrivals halls  there\
  \ was a man was holding blue big sheet of the program I was like the son who found\
  \ his mother in the crowd . they picked us to compounds we get to know each other\
  \ I met people from around the world  different language different color but all\
  \ of us having the same fear of the unknown , they announced that we will be moved\
  \ to Iceland by boat , we stared the trip through the sea the view was like were\
  \ sailing through heaven which located on earth, water was  dark blue it was pure\
  \ and sky was like clear there was like small mountain seems like growing from the\
  \ sea all are covered totally with grass wow that was so comfortable seen . We reached\
  \ the Iceland . that was like I reached Avatar all things was green and there was\
  \ a lot of monkeys and insects. we reached to a place have no internet connection\
  \ we were not able to used any phones or even laptops we also have been asked to\
  \ just only wear white . gave us instructions to be patient with animals and insects\
  \ even cockroaches, that was funny and  really difficult for me at the beginning\
  \ , in the early morning next day at 5 O\u2019clock the  a door was gently knocked\
  \ by someone saying good morning. We woke up In harry and go to meet  Monk Mr Lumpi\
  \ Pasura he was shaved Bald and wearing that orange dress he was speaking gently\
  \  with low voice full of peace and love . gave us our first lesson on meditation\
  \ and yoga as well as list to do everyday in order to cultivate peace . Thailand\
  \ was really suitable place to experience this chance  . Loved Thailand and Heaven\
  \ Iceland ."
