Text: "It was a starry summer night of July 2017, when I came back to Cyprus from\
  \ Greece, the place where I studied. Despite living abroad alone, despite the fact\
  \ I considered myself as open minded, the borders of my risk-taking decisions could\
  \ only go as far as a country where they have the same culture, traditions and language.\n\
  It was only when I had a plain discussion about me with my cousin, when I realized\
  \ that my life stories were much shorter and much less adventurous than my aspirations.\
  \ Being a person who always appreciated the gift of time, I came across with the\
  \ realization that I kept feeding my life perception with future goals instead of\
  \ present moments. But the clock only moves clockwise and the minutes that passed\
  \ will never been brought back again. Life is a one-shot moment. \nThen was when\
  \ I decided to start writing the book of my life. And my cousin, a curious adventurer\
  \ to say at least, was the right person to flare up the fire. Having been travelled\
  \ all across Europe on a bicycle, he offered me just some of his insights on how\
  \ I could break my limits. So did I. \nThe first step was to send an application\
  \ for an Erasmus+ project. That way I could overcome the constraint of \u201Cno\
  \ money\u201D. Although I did my first step, a little part of me insisted so much\
  \ to remain in my comfort zone, that my motivation letter was as long as 4 lines.\
  \ A few words to convince the organizers that I was the right person for them, but\
  \ still just enough for me to rest assured, considered that I did my part.\n Thus,\
  \ it came by surprise when they informed me that my application succeeded. Despite\
  \ my first hesitation, I thought \u201CAlex, you must go with the flow. You better\
  \ regret for what you did, than what you didn\u2019t\u201D \u2013 a phrase that\
  \ now became a way of life.\nWithout noticing how the days passed by, I found myself\
  \ in Chotebor, the place that the project was about to take place. They say that\
  \ time runs faster when you champ at the bit for something. Located in a big dark\
  \ forest near Prague, Czech Republic, little did I know that this place would light\
  \ up my desire for life.\nIn an isolated camp site, among 30 other strangers, the\
  \ get to know each other games escalated the feeling of loneliness but at the same\
  \ time, I was feeling in a circle of intimates. Although we all had different background,\
  \ coming from different countries, speaking different languages, there was one common\
  \ thing that it was just enough to create brotherly relationships: the desire to\
  \ escape our comfort zone.\nDay one, they were just a bunch of strangers. Day two,\
  \ they were the people with whom I shared my most adventurous exploration of a forest.\
  \ Day three, the friends with whom we shared our most hidden secrets, good or bad,\
  \ cheerful or depressed. Day four laughs, day five fights, day six hugs, day seven\
  \ party. All the way up to the last day \u2013 day eight \u2013 when we had to say\
  \ goodbye. But we couldn\u2019t. We didn\u2019t want to. How can anyone create such\
  \ a strong bonding in a week? How can I call a stranger, \u201Cbrother from another\
  \ mother\u201D and mean it, feel it, in just a couple of days? How can I cry for\
  \ someone I I didn\u2019t know a week ago?\nNow, after two years, having traveled\
  \ to more than ten countries, for more than a total of 200 days, having met more\
  \ than 300 new people, I keep coming back to these first strangers with whom I first\
  \ explored the unknown. Looking back at these days, I come to the conclusion that\
  \ my desire to explore the entire world, was actually desire to interact with people\
  \ all over the world.\nWhat differentiates us, sapiens, from the rest of the pieces,\
  \ is the need to interact with others and the capability of actually doing it. That\
  \ primitive need, originating hundreds of thousands of years ago, cannot be more\
  \ up-to-date, every day, every moment."
