Text: "When speaking about east sumba, not only the usual charm obtained, but also\
  \ the beauty and experience are not forgotten. The journey begins in the city of\
  \ waingapu, some tourist attraction are located quite far from city. We have to\
  \ rent a car to reach the tourist attraction. The first to explore was Tarimbang\
  \ beach, located at the edge of east sumba, the beach is 3 hours away from city\
  \ with a steep bend and challenging road. Along the way we were treated to stunning\
  \ views of the hills and meadow. Strong wind will blow and enter through the open\
  \ window.all the five senses are spoiled by nature hospitality. Based on the CNN\
  \ world version, Tarimbang beach is among the top 50 best beaches in the world.\
  \ The clean white sand beach blends with the cool weather, making us feel at home\
  \ to linger on this beach for sunbathing. The endless expanse of the Indian ocean\
  \ combined with the waves that kiss the vast shoreline, make this beach one of my\
  \ favorite beaches. \n\nMy next destination is to explored the East sumba city with\
  \ motorcycle.the place we visited was one of the traditional villages of waingapu\
  \ called \"Village of Raja Prailiu\". In this village there are a lot of megalithic\
  \ relics, one of which is the king Prailiu tomb stone House. Here, we can also see\
  \ the weaving process which have unique motifs and bright colors.\n\nAfternoon trip\
  \ we continue towards the \"Puru Kambera\" beach with around 40 minutes by motorbike\
  \ from city center. It is right decision to enjoying sunset in this place, giving\
  \ me unforgettable experience. The sun shine blends with the beautiful savanna Meadows.\
  \ What a charm!. It's truly breathtaking. I could not even aim at the camera lens\
  \ directly, stunned to devour all the amazing sights that could catch the eye.\n\
  \nOne other reason why East sumba is unforgettable charm is because the hospitality\
  \ of it's people. My friend whos born and raised there said that living in east\
  \ sumba is to be enjoyed, smiles and cheerfulness make it more beautiful."
