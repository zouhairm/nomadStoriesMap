Text: "Yes. I was sure I wanted to do this. I knew it. It was the right decision to\
  \ make. I was standing in front of the office and looked around. This was going\
  \ to be my new Saturday morning hangout. My new mission, my new voluntary work.\
  \ Although I was interning for 5 days in the week, I had the feeling that I wanted\
  \ to contribute something different to the South African society. I did not have\
  \ to look far before I figured out what I really wanted to do. I wanted to volunteer\
  \ with children with a disability. Make their life a little better. Yes. I am one\
  \ of those types, the I-want-to-make-the-world-a-better-place-for-everyone kind\
  \ of type. \n\nI arrived at the facility at 8 o\u2019clock sharp on Saturday morning.\
  \ The Uber dropped me in front of the gate. The parking space behind the gate was\
  \ empty as if no one was there. The inside of the facility was nicely decorated\
  \ with Disney paintings and there was a small garden with a children\u2019s playground.\
  \ It was quiet, there were no kids running, screaming or laughing in the hallway.\
  \ \n\nThe room I entered was quite small for the number of children. There were\
  \ around 25 children in total in a 30 square meter room. They were all placed in\
  \ a big circle so that they hypothetically could watch the TV. However, the TV was\
  \ so small that most of them could not see it at all. The nurses in charge gave\
  \ me orders. Feed this child with the red dress, feed that child with the blue t-shirt.\
  \ Growing up with a sister with a mental disability in the Netherlands I had never\
  \ experienced this. She had a name. A name that was being used. She was not \u201C\
  that girl with the red dress\u201D No. Her name was Marlieke.\n\nThe boy with the\
  \ blue t-shirt smiled at me. He could not talk and I had to feed him his breakfast.\
  \ I could see he liked me. He liked me being around. He was curious in his own way.\n\
  \nAfter giving the children their breakfast, I asked a grumpy looking nurse if I\
  \ could take one of the children outside for a walk. She was looking at me as if\
  \ I were crazy, but finally agreed with my idea. \n\nI took this child with the\
  \ blue t-shirt \u2013 A small boy in a wheelchair with the most beautiful smile\
  \ \u2013 outside the facility. The sun was shining. It was summer in South Africa\
  \ and the temperature was high. It was a beautiful day to be outside. You could\
  \ smell that someone had been mowing the lawn. There was almost no one on the streets\
  \ except for us. So now and then a car passed by. We saw a woman letting her dog\
  \ out. The smile on the face of the boy with the blue t-shirt became bigger and\
  \ bigger. I could also see that he was struggling with the sun, but he did not want\
  \ to go back to the facility. He enjoyed being outside. \n\nI realized that he could\
  \ have been my sister. What if she was born here and he was born in my family? How\
  \ different would both of their lives be while they have so much in common. I felt\
  \ a connection with this boy. I knew he was capable of so much more if he got the\
  \ right support. It just takes someone to see the opportunities, the abilities instead\
  \ of the disabilities. \n\nAfter half an hour it was time to go back. We crossed\
  \ the street and waved at the guard. The guard opened the long grey gate for us\
  \ and we entered the well-known area of the facility. I took the boy inside, back\
  \ to the other children of his group. His smile disappeared. He was again one of\
  \ them. The boy with the blue t-shirt. Next to the girl with the red dress. And\
  \ suddenly I realized; I still don\u2019t know his name."
