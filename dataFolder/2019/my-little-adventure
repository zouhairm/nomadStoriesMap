Text: "Two years ago facing some setbacks in my life, I much needed a break from all\
  \ of it. Travel has always been my stress pill and I loved traveling since I was\
  \ a kid but I was looking for something different this time. Skimming through many\
  \ travel blogs I came across the hidden gem, landlocked marvel, \u201CMongolia\u201D\
  \ sandwiched between the giants Russia and China. I was enamoured of Mongolia\u2019\
  s wild charm and I found myself standing in the queue to board the flight to Ulaanbaatar\
  \ the very next week. \n\nUlaanbaatar is quite small for a capital city yet half\
  \ of the population of Mongolia lives here. The first day, I took a walk around\
  \ S\xFCkhbaatar square boasting the famous Genghis khan\u2019s memorial monument\
  \ and a bronze statue of the war hero S\xFCkhbaatar. The square is surrounded by\
  \ government buildings, local residencies with a view of cities\u2019 skyscrapers.\
  \ It\u2019s almost time for lunch! Looking at the restaurant menu, I panicked instantly\
  \ as it sums up to red meat mostly and I am a vegetarian, let alone speaking Mongolian\
  \ I never even heard a single Mongolian word in my entire life to explain the situation.\
  \ But that didn\u2019t stop me from enjoying a delicious vegetable stew with rice,\
  \ all kudos to the kind Mongolian chef who understood me and prepared a dish out\
  \ of the menu for me. After dinner, I visited a local pub to catch a glimpse of\
  \ the cities\u2019 vibrant nightlife; Mongolians definitely can hold their drink!\
  \ \n\nThe following day is the start of prominent festival \u201CNaadam\u201D, celebrated\
  \ nationwide for three days with horse racing, archery, and wrestling competitions.\
  \ I attended the military parade in the morning at the square and followed it to\
  \ the National sports stadium where the events take place. The stadium is filled\
  \ with people of all ages cheering for their favourite players. An elderly person\
  \ sitting beside me tried to explain the game rules with hand gestures despite our\
  \ language differences! It brought me back the sweet memories of watching games\
  \ as a kid with my grandpa.\n\nThe next day started the real adventure to the great\
  \ Gobi desert along with my new companions and a tour guide. We bought drinking\
  \ water bottles and necessities required to sustain the harsh desert climate. After\
  \ a five hour drive in an old Russian van, vanished the city lights, paved roads,\
  \ cell phone signals, and at the sight of a caravan of camels, we realized that\
  \ we have reached our destination. Our accommodation was \u201CGers\u201D, traditional\
  \ Mongolian portable tents and homes to the local nomads for centuries. Gers were\
  \ warm and cozy with beds and a fire pit in the middle used for both cooking and\
  \ heating. We were invited by the nomad family into their Ger and greeted with traditional\
  \ salt tea and cheese made of camels milk. I noticed how content and happy the people\
  \ are with the simple nomadic lifestyle they built for themselves. \n\nThe following\
  \ days our adventures continued from riding camels to climbing sand dunes to hunting\
  \ for dinosaur fossils in Flaming cliffs and hiking through Tsagaan-suvarga, Yol\
  \ Valley. A visit to Erdene-Zuu monastery gave me an insight into the influence\
  \ of Buddhism on Mongolia. I enjoyed everything my guide has to say about the stories\
  \ from the communist era and the legend of great Genghis Khan.  \n\nAfter a week\
  \ in the endless sands of the desert, now it\u2019s time to visit the green lush\
  \ Orkhon valley. The scent of the steppe and sound of waterfalls filled me with\
  \ high spirits. The next two days we explored the Ulaan Tsutgalaan River, red waterfalls\
  \ on the back of wild Mongolian horses wearing the traditional costume I lend from\
  \ a local rider. Our last day ended with a spectacular Mongolian throat singing\
  \ performance.   \n\nA leap into this unknown territory made me realize what it\
  \ is like to live in the arms of nature, embrace the challenges, appreciate the\
  \ generosity of strangers, and make friends along. Every minute of the trip was\
  \ a real high but nothing could beat down the nights where we laid down on the sand\
  \ jamming to 70\u2019s rock songs while gazing at the star-studded skies in the\
  \ heart of Gobi."
