Text: "That was an isolated evening when I decided to run away to some place where\
  \ nobody knew me. 2 months prior to that depressed evening me and my girlfriend\
  \ decided to get separated so we broke up. Life wasn\u2019t the same after. Depress,\
  \ sad and a hollow heart I was carrying until that blissful evening when I decided\
  \ a getaway. A break for myself to be precise. All this while when I was downhearted\
  \ my friends keep on telling me stories about this place called \u201CKasol\u201D\
  \ which never seemed interesting to me. It\u2019s located in Himachal Pradesh, India.\
  \ So I spoke to myself and had a serious conversation with myself and thank go I\
  \ got the permission to go out and explore from myself. Haha! \nI was in delhi those\
  \ days and it was 8:45 in the evening and I decided to leave right away. I packed\
  \ a few stuff, some money and a nice winter jacket and left for the bus station.\
  \ Got into the bus at around 11 in the night and phew I was out. No Idea when did\
  \ I fell asleep but early morning around 7 the bus stopped at some place for snacks\
  \ and breakfast. So I picked up my jacket, phone and wallet and got out of the bus.\
  \ The moment I got out and raise my head I saw the most beautiful scenery ever.\
  \ It was like a dream that I couldn\u2019t believe. It was dreamy. I saw little\
  \ hotel at the edge of the cliff with a river flowing beside and it\u2019s all covered\
  \ with mountains from all 4 sides. Close your eyes and think about it for 5 seconds.\
  \ See exactly it was that beautiful. The sun was out and it was bright sunlight\
  \ on the mountains and that sweet sound of the flowing water. And there I was holding\
  \ a cup of tea in my hand and sipping it as slow as I can. We got into the bus again\
  \ again in 3 hours we were reaching to our final destination. After that little\
  \ break I was already very excited for this place kasol. We were driving through\
  \ mountains but the river never abandoned us. It was there as if it\u2019s guiding\
  \ us to our destination. The 3 hours went so quick and there I saw a little village\
  \ surrounded by mountains. It was all green with colourful little huts and houses.\
  \ Everything seemed sweet. Even if somebody was honking continuously it didn\u2019\
  t offend me. I was mesmerised by the beauty of this place. I got down at the bus\
  \ station of kasol and to be honest I was in no rush to find an accommodation rather\
  \ I gave myself an hour where I decide that I\u2019ll go somewhere and sit with\
  \ a cup of tea and good cheese sandwich and just appreciate the beauty of this place.\
  \ And yes I found a cafe (paradise cafe) and that cafe did justice to its name.\
  \ It was right beside the river and there was this table beneath the palm tree from\
  \ where you could see the maintains talk and hear the river sing. It was mesmerising.\
  \ After this lovely therapy to my eyes and I decided to hunt for a hotel. A cheap\
  \ budget hotel to be honest as I was just a student and I didn\u2019t want anything\
  \ to go beyond my budget. I spoke to the manager at the cafe and told me that they\
  \ have a hotel as well. Oh wow!!! I screamed. He took me to their hotel and oh good\
  \ lord. It was villa turned into a little hotel. It was exactly looked like ones\
  \ I have seen in the movies. I was standing the the gate and there was this villa\
  \ looked so tiny because of the mountains behind it as if those sky touching mountains\
  \ are his guards. This place was dope. Stayed there for two best days of my life.\
  \ I still remember those nights in that place we used to do campfire and we all\
  \ used to sing and dance together. \nLife is so much more that sitting and getting\
  \ depressed. Get out and explore!! \nYou will fall in love with yourself."
