Text: "Almost There\nby Deb McCoy\n\n        Where is Th\u01CEng? Jennifer from the\
  \ adoption agency promised he would pick me up near baggage claim. Now what? I tried\
  \ not to panic, but the scene was chaotic, and I wracked my brain deciding what\
  \ to do. I wandered, circling a radius small enough that I wouldn\u2019t miss Th\u01CE\
  ng. He didn\u2019t come.\n\n       Jennifer had warned me it would be hot in Ho\
  \ Chi Minh City, offering a description about Vietnam\u2019s weather. \u201CIt\u2019\
  s hot and dry or hot and wet,\u201D she said. Outside, the humidity landed on my\
  \ head and I shrunk several inches. My legs, heavy, didn\u2019t cooperate.\n\n \
  \      I\u2019d never seen or heard so many motorbikes in one place\u2014the noise\
  \ was oppressive. Twenty-five years after the airlift out of Vietnam, the country\
  \ was trying to recover. The cars looked as desperate as the faces of those who\
  \ drove them, and I couldn\u2019t decipher taxis from personal autos. Pessimistic,\
  \ I approached the curb. My thighs stuck together as I paced, and I cursed my lucky\
  \ skirt, yearning for a mini-version.\n\n       Deb, don\u2019t waste time. Pick\
  \ someone. Seconds later, I reminded myself that I had sons at home. Should I really\
  \ get in the car with a stranger? Consumed with getting to my daughter, I ignored\
  \ my thoughts. An inch off the curb, I was accosted by three men, all yelling, \u201C\
  Taxi, taxi.\u201D I made eye contact with the one who smiled, produced my scrap\
  \ of paper containing my hotel info and he gestured for me to follow. Deep into\
  \ the parking lot, we wandered, without finding his vehicle. I scowled, folded my\
  \ arms, and he understood that I wasn\u2019t moving. He appeared with a vehicle,\
  \ grabbed my suitcase and I crawled into the backseat.\n\n\tAfter checking into\
  \ the hotel, I dragged myself to my room. No time to shower, I perched on the side\
  \ of the bed, waiting, and lunged at the phone when it chirped. Th\u01CEng introduced\
  \ himself. He would be my companion in Saigon. He would take me to see my baby,\
  \ every one of my six days here.\n\n\t Walking down a staircase reminiscent of \u201C\
  Gone with the Wind,\u201D I saw a young man, damp from sweat, standing in the lobby.\
  \ Hurrying to close the gap between us, he offered his hand and I liked him. He\
  \ led me down another impressive set of stairs and we slid onto the leather seats\
  \ of an unmarked taxi. While Th\u01CEng gave the driver instructions, I breathed\
  \ in through my nose and out through my mouth, calling up some Yoga calm. \n\n\t\
  The driver had no idea where he was going. He and Th\u01CEng conversed in energetic\
  \ tones and we made several U-turns, without enough notice to other drivers. I doubted\
  \ that we would arrive unharmed.\n\n\tConfused about what time it was, I couldn\u2019\
  t process how long we drove before seeing the orphanage. I accepted that I didn\u2019\
  t know what day it was. Just get me to M\u1EF9 Dung, my daughter.\n\n\tI wasn\u2019\
  t prepared for what I saw. I shook my head, shocked, sad. Minutes away from the\
  \ hotel district, the landscape took on a gritty character. Poverty, chaotic traffic,\
  \ remnants of past destruction. There were no lanes keeping vehicles in check, no\
  \ traffic lights being obeyed, chunks of shattered cinder blocks everywhere. I fought\
  \ to keep my mouth closed, gaping at the frenetic weaving of vehicles. Relentless\
  \ beeping drowned out Th\u01CEng\u2019s every word\u2014I was amazed that I\u2019\
  d witnessed only one accident. A close call with our cab was almost the second when\
  \ a motorcyclist ran out of road. He took a piece of our cab\u2019s mirror with\
  \ him, without slowing down. My daughter was born in this. \n\n\tWhen I\u2019d given\
  \ up hope that our driver would locate the orphanage, he swerved into an alley,\
  \ and stopped in front of an iron barricade. Th\u01CEng nodded, just as an exhausted-looking\
  \ man wearing a threadbare blue shirt opened the gate.\n\n\tSeconds away from my\
  \ daughter, I heard a thud coming from my chest as I stepped out of the taxi.\n\n\
  \tGrateful and sad, I imagined how a mother might give up her daughter, hoping she\
  \ would have a better life. My conflict, joy vs. guilt, was heavy."
