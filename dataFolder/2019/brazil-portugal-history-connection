Text: "Since I was a kid, history was the subject that I most hate, but in the other\
  \ hand I always was curious about the past and the future.\nIn high school I got\
  \ more interested and started to study more.\nNovember 2017 I went for the first\
  \ time to Ortugal, more specifically Lisbon, Sintra and Cascais. And that time made\
  \ me realize that our past is not teach the same way.\nAnd a very important exemple\
  \ is D. Pedro I (in Brazil) actually is D. Pedro IV (in Portugal).\nAnd they also\
  \ have a lot of brazilian influence in their music.\nDuring my trip in Portugal\
  \ I was always in touch with my history teacher in high school, asking and comparing\
  \ all the facts in the foretime.\nI had the chance to know more about all of this\
  \ through the walking tour, and that\u2019s a thing I look for on the first day\
  \ in a new city. Know the history from a native then go see for my self, with a\
  \ little of background.\nTo describe Lisbon the world would perfectly be \u2018\
  discover\u2019. Food, buildings, streets, alleys, all my past for real, seen with\
  \ my own eyes.\n\u2018Pra\xE7a do Com\xE9rcio\u2019, \u2018Pra\xE7a dos Restauradores\u2019\
  , Bel\xE9m Tower, besides churchs, stairwais, etc.\n2 days and a half exploring,\
  \ eating and some souvenirs, for personal collection and a few friends.\nIn Sintra,\
  \ the world to describe it is adventure. All those hills, old big houses, ruins\
  \ from Mouros\u2019 castle, and a huge colored palace in the higest hill.\nWas a\
  \ hard walking day, but worthy every step.\nIn third, Cascais, a beach place, with\
  \ a long road following the ocean.\nI rented a bike and took the day to ride, relax,\
  \ exercise and enjoy the good weather, for the beginning of a thought winter.\n\
  Made some stops on the way to take some pictures, get some rest and look at the\
  \ waves.\nAfter 4 1/2 days of Portugal I had spent 150\u20AC less than I expected,\
  \ and I didn\u2019t gold myself back with money.\nI beautiful country, sad past,\
  \ great food, a lively nightlife, a lovely place to visit and maybe even live."
