Text: "I will never forget the first day I landed in London , I felt like I am dreaming\
  \ as this young girl coming from small town in Algeria can\u2019t be in London this\
  \ moment this is too good to be true , but it was a dream that she worked hard to\
  \ turn into reality , looking out the window of taxi I was shocked is this London\
  \ it doesn\u2019t look amazing than I realise I am still stuck in traffic next to\
  \ the airport , the minute we started getting close to the city I started to see\
  \ that view that I will never forget the old houses the same architecture the red\
  \ double buses i was mesmerised bumpy everything I was making sure i am looking\
  \ everywhere as I didn\u2019t want to miss any details , i saw an old lady waiting\
  \ for the green light to cross she was wearing such lovely colours you would feel\
  \ she is 19 , we checked in at the hotel I didn\u2019t stay a minute I throw my\
  \ suitcase on my bed and run out because I didn\u2019t want to miss any minute started\
  \ looking around the street and all the houses were like one house multipled I loved\
  \ it and the city had a smell I am not sure if it was my imagination or it does\
  \ actually has a smell it I closed my eye and just enjoyed it maybe because were\
  \ close to the river but I will never forget that smell , we took a bus and immediately\
  \ I run to sit upstairs as if it was vip upstairs or we will arrive first but I\
  \ had great view look at tall building many buses people in a hurry we arrived at\
  \ the Waterloo bridge and I was amazed by the view I can see the amazing Big Ben\
  \ I can see many bridges around me it was just amazing and it was late so i witnessed\
  \ an amazing sunset \U0001F305 I just can\u2019t describe it and it reflection of\
  \ the tall building next to the river was amazing than I heard it that noise that\
  \ I will never forget the first time I heard the Big Ben at 6:00pm sharp it was\
  \ such beautiful bell \U0001F6CE noises I just closed my eyes so I can remember\
  \ it exactly and remember the feeling I grabbed a late and just set down on a chair\
  \ next to themes river and kept looking at the view I think I was there for an hour\
  \ but I felt like it was 10 min the next day I went to see the place and I was just\
  \ waiting to see the queen silly me the guards and their hats were so funny I am\n\
  Not sure what I felt but I knew in that moment that as close it can be to the royal\
  \ family , I loved that experience I can go on and on about it because every street\
  \ from the shopping at Oxford Circus to the night life in piccadely circus everything\
  \ was a different experience I loved it and I would never be able to experience\
  \ those feeling Again as this city had a special vibe sp coal history everything\
  \ was unique until the next city and the next story"
