Text: "I was in Nazca ready to go on a sand surfing tour, but I almost didn\u2019\
  t go, because I wasn\u2019t feeling all that well. It was almost like something\
  \ inside me didn\u2019t want to meet my destiny. But, then I just convinced myself\
  \ to go, because it was something I had wanted to do for a while, so I loaded with\
  \ vitamins, herbs and a lot of excitement. We traveled through the desert and discovered\
  \ ancient ruins, mesmerizing views and then stopped on a tall dune for sand boarding.\
  \ We prepared our boards, the guide gave us simple instructions on what to do and\
  \ wax for our boards for speed. I was the last one in the group to go, which gave\
  \ me plenty of time to observe all the other people, I wanted to make the most of\
  \ it and get it as perfect as possible, being yes! The perfectionist I am. \n\n\
  Most of the people just landed on the first dune bellow us. It was my turn, I wanted\
  \ perfection!. I lowered the board and laid on it head forward, went down the hill\
  \ and unlike the others my board never stopped. Perfection I did get. I am sure\
  \ no one had seen a board that got such high speed before that. I went down the\
  \ dune and up the next hill, and repeated a few more times. I tried to break, but\
  \ in reality, our guide hadn\u2019t quite prepared us for breaking at such speed.\
  \ I just held on tight to the board and just hoped for the best.  \n\nThe best came\
  \ a few seconds later, when I got to a very steep downhill full of gravel, the dune\
  \ was ending and ahead of me down the hill were a few big stones and trees and dead\
  \ bushes at the base of the trees. That was for me the point of no return, I was\
  \ going really fast, I briefly considered trying to jump from the board, but the\
  \ sand was thick and coarse at that point. I looked ahead to my choices, I decided\
  \ the trees were more noble than the rocks, so head first I aimed for them. For\
  \ a few split seconds while going down the hill I just gave up and surrendered to\
  \ it all, my life in a sense flashed in front of me and I just surrendered to what\
  \ should happen. I was free of fear with a deep sense of peace, my body and spirit\
  \ felt light. I didn\u2019t know what would happen, but I was ready to die. I closed\
  \ my eyes tightly and just went for it.\n\nIn a split second I landed and penetrated\
  \ a bush or rather the thorns penetrated and squished my body. I was afraid to open\
  \ my eyes, I felt pressure through out my body. Then, I asked myself some questions,\
  \ am I alive? I was breathing, Yes! I felt alive. There was pain everywhere, but\
  \ specially in my mouth. Did I break something? No! it didn\u2019t seem like it\
  \ HALLELUJAH!... I opened my eyes, to discover that I was stuck inside one of the\
  \ bushes full of thorns and they were puncturing my body. I couldn\u2019t move,\
  \ go forward or backward, I was basically pinned down. I waited in complete solitude,\
  \ waited, hoping that someone would come, but no one did, waited some more, until\
  \ I gathered courage to go through the bush. I recognized I was under the influence\
  \ of adrenaline, which was my biggest allied at that moment, so I trusted and did\
  \ it. When I came out of it I was in pure excitement and joy, blissfully thankful\
  \ to be alive. I looked at my body and it was full of sand, blood and I had thorns\
  \ pretty much in every place, including my head. I proceeded to take them out one\
  \ by one. My guide arrived and he looked at my precarious conditions and got scared,\
  \ until he saw my excitement and radiant smile, which confused him and puzzled him\
  \ for a second, but he was relieved I was in one piece, just like I was."
