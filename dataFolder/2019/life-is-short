Text: "There really are no words to explain the despair of going home from the hospital\
  \ the day my husband passed away following a 6-month battle with cancer.\n\nIt was\
  \ literally incomprehensible to me that he wasn\u2019t alive anymore.\n\nBora Bora\
  \ off the bucket list.\n\nOnce my husband was diagnosed with stage 4 cancer, I didn\u2019\
  t go back to work at all for over a year. For 6 months, my life became about being\
  \ the best caretaker, advocate, personal pharmacist, and wife I could possibly be.\
  \ I lived and breathed for him because that\u2019s what he deserved and needed,\
  \ and I wanted to spend every second I had left with him. \n\nAfter my husband was\
  \ gone, it felt like my entire future had been ripped out from under me. All my\
  \ hopes and dreams had involved the two of us together. But life took on new meaning.\
  \ Now it was \u201Cme\u201D instead of \u201Cwe.\u201D\n\nHaving been together since\
  \ we were 19, I needed to learn how to be an individual. So much of who I was had\
  \ been defined by us as a couple. Who was I, after all of this? What did I want\
  \ out of life? I needed to find out. I needed to encounter myself somehow.\n\n Home\
