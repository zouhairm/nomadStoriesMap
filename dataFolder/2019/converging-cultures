Text: "As I stood in the middle of the sidewalk, I was startled by cacophony of cars\u2019\
  \ horns honking. I squinted up at the nearby sign stating the street name, but the\
  \ meaning was not clear. After studying Mandarin for nearly a year, this was my\
  \ first time visiting the country. The strangely-shaped green mountains of Yangshuo\
  \ loomed above me, not quite welcoming me--yet. I had landed in this city, a handful\
  \ of hours from Hong Kong by train, very recently. My eyes were wide open. A nearby\
  \ shop owner on an unrecognizable street urged me to buy her wares. \u201C\u4F60\
  \u60F3\u4E70\u4E9B\u82F9\u679C\u5417\uFF1FDo you want to buy some apples?\u201D\
  \ I averted my eyes and moved on, unable to dredge up courage to buy anything. \n\
  I had turned in my resignation four months previously as a teacher at a local elementary\
  \ school to pursue my long-awaited dream of visiting China. This desire to \u201C\
  one day go there\u201D had come. Today was the day! Was my love for the country\
  \ genuine; more than a bookish idea? \nVery quickly I learned from my \u8001\u5E08\
  \ \u201Cteachers\u201D that expectations were far different than what I had learned\
  \ in Western culture. First of all, most people attending the language school came\
  \ from other parts of the world and were \u897F\u65B9\u4EBA \u201CWesterners.\u201D\
  \ Whether they were German, Irish, or Canadian, all were grouped in this one category.\
  \ It is just a part of assimilating into Chinese culture. Also, burping is expected\
  \ when a meal is delicious. Don\u2019t say thank you among friends. It is okay to\
  \ stand up while eating. Slurping is normal and napkins are rarely used. Honking\
  \ is a courtesy and the car will still merge. In Karaoke everyone is expected to\
  \ participate, no matter what language. And my personal favorite: It is okay to\
  \ ride your motor scooter anywhere, just make sure not to run over a pedestrian.\
  \ \nThe city\u2019s gardens and koi ponds were perfect, and there was often an available\
  \ walking path that I could traverse. The area of China where I lived afforded me\
  \ the luxury of stepping out the door to my school, turning down a paved road bordered\
  \ by the base of the rolling mountain range, and ending up in a tree-filled park,\
  \ all in the span of five minutes. These were moments to breathe in the silence\
  \ and just soak in this new wild adventure. \nOnce I could say more than simple\
  \ phrases in Mandarin, I began practicing with other students. At first, words seemed\
  \ to run together like mud, but friends patiently explained phrases and I got more\
  \ adept using language learning apps. My questions like \u201CWhat is that delicious\
  \ smell?\u201D for nearby vendors at first caused shopkeepers to snicker. \u201C\
  Ha-ha! What a terrible accent!\u201D As they branched into inquiring about school\
  \ or my job in the states, I grew more confident.\nSoon I started teaching myself\
  \ to write and read Chinese characters. My teachers allowed me to move up to a class\
  \ flooded with Mandarin conversation and essay assignments. My extremely limited\
  \ vocabulary was no match. One day a teacher read a sentence from my half-page essay\
  \ and put it down, just staring at me. Had I scribbled something illegible? \u201C\
  Have you been practicing Spanish?\u201D she asked. I reluctantly confirmed her suspicion.\
  \ Another student from Spain and I had dialogues about our European travels. She\
  \ instructed me not to utilize Spanish for the rest of my time there. The grammar\
  \ was different. My heart sank. Abandon my second language? But with only a month\
  \ to go, I was determined to give up what was necessary to hone my Chinese language.\
  \ \nBy the time I left, I had a basic grasp of Mandarin and new friends from several\
  \ cultures. I was more sure of myself. This was the first time I had experienced\
  \ culture shock in the real sense! Yet this was also the deepest immersion! It is\
  \ okay to ask questions and practice imperfectly. Making mistakes sometimes banishes\
  \ fear. I could find directions or try new foods, sing a new song or scale a mountain\
  \ with Mandarin-speaking friends. In the incessant noise of the plane, I thought,\
  \ \u201CThis has been the most exhausting and the most exhilarating time ever!\u201D"
