Text: "Only Myself to Rely On\n\nThe train is slowing down again, I\u2019ve been on\
  \ for about five stops, each time getting more backed into a corner with my huge\
  \ backpack awkwardly sitting in between my legs. This time people are actually getting\
  \ off instead of trying to squeeze on.\n\n\u201CWhere are we?\u201D I asked the\
  \ two older men standing beside me on the train.\n\n\u201CThis is Brighton.\u201D\
  \ One answers in an English accent.\n\nI felt instant relief. I made it. I took\
  \ a train by myself and ended up where I was supposed to be. It was a little victory\
  \ but after a lifetime of having family or friends to rely on and ask for reassurance\
  \ when choosing a movie to go to with them or asking which route to take home, it\
  \ felt huge. I was across the world in a new country, all by myself.\n\nI got off\
  \ the train onto the platform and started walking down the street to my hostel.\
  \ I knew the route because I read the directions multiple times, and also the directions\
  \ just said to follow the road straight down, turn left, and you\u2019re basically\
  \ there. Not much was left to the imagination but I didn\u2019t have much faith\
  \ in myself, at least not yet.\n\nBrighton gave me a culture shock. It was a bank\
  \ holiday in the UK and on a 25-degree day everyone was heading to the beach to\
  \ enjoy the sun. The group of guys I was following took no time to open their bottles\
  \ of beer and start drinking, just out in the open because it was legal. It was\
  \ something so simple but after growing up in Canada it was ingrained in me that\
  \ public drinking was not allowed.\n\nAfter checking into my hostel with the literal\
  \ weight of my backpack off my shoulders, I went to explore. I followed the crowds,\
  \ looked left first to cross the street, stopped in the middle at the sidewalk,\
  \ then looked right. The pebble beach was in sight and it was packed with families\
  \ eating their lunch and teenagers drinking and laughing with their friends. Instead\
  \ of going straight to the beach to relax I walked along the shops which were imbedded\
  \ into the wall, with displays and outdoor seating areas jutting into the expansive\
  \ sidewalk. I needed food and the first little stand I saw, serving fish & chips\
  \ was just calling my name. It wasn\u2019t the greatest and I was disappointed,\
  \ I\u2019m still not sure whether it was actually the fish or the jet-lag finally\
  \ catching up with me but nevertheless I was feeling a little sick. I walked a little\
  \ more, wandering through some shops and buying my first souvenir sticker of a topless\
  \ mermaid holding a martini in one hand and a cigarette in the other, it was a perfect\
  \ representation of Brighton. \n\nThe beach was soon calling my name and I was ready\
  \ to sit and enjoy. I sat on the pebbles, took out my journal and just looked around.\
  \ I was finally taking it all in. This is a new country where I knew absolutely\
  \ no one. I let my mind wander and soon a few hours had gone by. \n\nI didn\u2019\
  t have any plans for the rest of the day so I thought I should go see more of this\
  \ little seaside town. I\u2019ve heard about the lanes so that was where I was headed.\
  \ Although it was a holiday and many of the stores were closed I kept endlessly\
  \ strolling through the streets while window shopping. My plan-less day was winding\
  \ down as I suddenly came to the Royal Pavilion, I already thought it was stunning\
  \ but later when I found out it was the influence behind an ice sculpture in the\
  \ Harry Potter movies I was excited to have found it, especially since it was by\
  \ chance.\n\nMy first day abroad ended in an eight-person hostel room where I was\
  \ the only girl with seven boys, a fact that I would conveniently leave out when\
  \ on the phone with my parents. I fell asleep thinking \u201Cone day down and twenty-seven\
  \ more to go.\u201D"
