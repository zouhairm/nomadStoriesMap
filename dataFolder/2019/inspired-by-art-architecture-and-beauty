Text: "I knew that France was a beautiful country and that Paris is a beautiful city,\
  \ but I had no idea how mesmerizing this country and this city really is. \n\nEach\
  \ building is an artistic accomplishment with so many details and history. You can\
  \ literally walk the streets of Paris and feel like you are in a museum, while examining\
  \ the architecture. \n\nThere are so many museums to visit, not just the well known\
  \ ones like the Louvre, but the Picasso Museum, the Museum D'Orsy, and many others.\
  \ \n\nThere are so many beautiful parks with statues and fountains where you can\
  \ enjoy the scenery and relax. For example, the Jardin des Tuileries, with statues,\
  \ open spaces, cafes, and fountains. One can literally spend an entire afternoon\
  \ just in this park. \n\nAlso, there are the monuments, such as the Arc de Triomphe\
  \ overlooking the famous Parisian promenade Champs Elysees. You can go to the top\
  \ of the monument and see the entire city from a birds eye view. \n\nThere are also\
  \ musical venues, including two opera houses: the Palace Garnier and the Opera Bastille.\
  \ One is built in a lovely, classical architecture and the other in a modern architecture.\
  \ Both have continous viewings of many popular operas for those who love this musical\
  \ format. \n\nI fell in love with France and, especially Paris and it was love at\
  \ first sight. \n\nIf you love art and culture you will have no end to your pleasure\
  \ and fulfilment in France."
