Text: "The sun is setting behind the backdrop of muddy hills, as we sail silently\
  \ in Aswan. I was at peace, but only on the surface. Deep within, I listen to the\
  \ tune of memories playing in sync with the gentle splashes of river Nile. As I\
  \ reminisce the past nine days spent in Egypt, the record suddenly gets stuck, stuck\
  \ on the first day. A day when I learnt about another religion most of the Egyptians\
  \ seemed to follow; when my inhibitions about the Arabic land otherwise considered\
  \ not-so-safe by most travel sites were drowned in the sound of ecstasy. \n\nOctober\
  \ 8, 2017: I have landed in Cairo and am making my way through the immigration counter.\
  \ The wall to my left has a mosaic of three figures straight out of Michael Jackson\u2019\
  s Remember The Time. Only now, they stand tall and still as my first impression\
  \ of Egypt.  \n \nOn the way to our hotel, we cross Tahrir Square. While Mohammed,\
  \ our host, describes about the significance of the landmark, my ears act deaf to\
  \ his words. I am lost in searching for differences in the similarities I find in\
  \ the streets. The commotion, the traffic, the congestion, it all replicated that\
  \ of India. Even the dust that drifted along was strangely familiar. It felt like\
  \ home except for the Arabic music resounding in the car, where the only barrier\
  \ that existed was language.\n\nWe soon set out to take a stroll in the market.\
  \ Just as I am about to feel cheated with the ordinary in my first cross-continental\
  \ trip, I notice something strikingly unusual: each eatery has spread out chairs\
  \ facing a television set, outside their boundaries. Each TV set with only one game\
  \ on: World Cup qualifier between Egypt and Congo. In this shanty neighborhood,\
  \ all I saw was TV sets spaced out at regular intervals, claiming its rightful viewers.\
  \ \n\nReaching the all touristy Khan el-Khalili Bazaar, my stint with the TVs ended.\
  \ Or so I thought. The glittery belly-dance costumes, the antique jewelry and unique\
  \ artifacts could not sustain the damage this exhilarating match had on the shopkeepers\u2019\
  \ selling power. \n\nThe closer the match drew to its end, the louder the TV sounded.\
  \ The louder the sound of the idiot box (acting smart for a change), even louder\
  \ went the roar of the crowd at coffee shops.\n\nIn the dying moments of the match,\
  \ there were seconds of deathly fear that gripped tourists and residents alike.\
  \ And at that instant, the loudest cheer tore through each of our hearts, as if,\
  \ the market and its people had been possessed by a wave of vigor. \n\nEgypt had\
  \ won.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t like the country had merely qualified for the FIFA 2018.\
  \ It wasn\u2019t even as if they had won the series, to say the least. It was like\
  \ they had won the world itself.\n  \n\u201CIt\u2019s independence achieved after\
  \ 18 years; freedom from not of playing in a world cup since 1990; freedom from\
  \ the shame of not cheering for our country in our second religion,\u201D said our\
  \ host.\n \nI had only heard of football being a religion to many. I was practicing\
  \ it this time.\n\nThe vibe and the view changed with every blink of my eye. Some\
  \ danced on cars, some more skateboarded behind them. Like a carnival, the celebration\
  \ headed to Tahrir Square. While most toddlers slept peacefully amid those honking\
  \ and hooters, a handful of half-asleep, evidently clueless kids tried to keep their\
  \ eyes open. \n\nTurning the tables to a new conversation, I spotted two women in\
  \ hijab sitting on the bonnet of one of the cars. It was followed by three cars\
  \ running back-to-back, surprisingly, with women drivers in each.  It was one in\
  \ a million views. In a nation perceived as conservative, the little feminist in\
  \ me swelled up with pride seeing their freedom. \n\nIn a flash, I wasn\u2019t seeing\
  \ them. I was them.\n\nI now know why the place has restored the straight-out-of-the-history-book\
  \ feel. For history of this scale cannot be repeated. Only by being in this part\
  \ of geography, I was able to be a part of their history that could never be recreated."
