Text: "A cheap Air Asia flight to Thailand started off in Bangkok to look at the three\
  \ famous temples. Though they were all stunning and beautiful one of my favorite\
  \ things was the food. Pad Thai noodles, red curry chicken, and save room for mango\
  \ sticky rice! Week days mornings start off in chaos, just stand on the street corner\
  \ to watch the impressive traffic swerve in and out on taxi motor bikes with three\
  \ to four people on them. A stop in a seven level mall with A movie theater, aquarium,\
  \ wax museum, fish market and anything else you can think off put North Americas\
  \ shopping malls to shame. \n\nWe booked an elephant expedition through trip advisor\
  \ a few weeks before and had a long day ahead. We woke early to meet a van, no others\
  \ were on our excursion that day so we stretched our for our two hour drive to Kanchanaburi.\
  \ We stopped briefly to see the Bridge on the River of Kwai and learn some history.\
  \ Our tour guide was a humorous young Thai man who explained the elephants were\
  \ treated well and not tortured as many fear.  We spent the day riding the elephants,\
  \ feeding them bananas, and playing with them in the river. On the way back we did\
  \ a brief stop to feed and play with a 4 month old baby tiger. She was so strong\
  \ already, soft with big feet. The woman in charge explained why they take the tigers\
  \ away and that at one year old they reintroduce them to their family at a safe\
  \ place.\n\nAfter a few days of city life we were ready to move on to relax on the\
  \ beaches. A short $80 one hour flight and we landed in Krabi. Our beautiful resort\
  \ made for a king was less than $120 a night! The next morning we woke early to\
  \ get our own long tail boat and headed to Hong Island for some snorkeling. The\
  \ beautiful emerald green waters and endless limestone rock islands were breathtaking.\
  \ After we enjoyed our time exploring we headed back for a shower and dinner on\
  \ the beach. As we walked along the beach front at night all these little hidden\
  \ huts turn into hidden restaurant gems that light up...who knew they even existed??\
  \ A few huts were rentals for less than $30 a night! The next day we rented a scooter\
  \ for $7 a day and rode to Ao Nang to look around shop's for souviners. We decided\
  \ to take another long tail boat to Railey beach, upon arrival we rented a kayak\
  \ and paddled around the caves nearby. Once exhausted we went back to our scooter\
  \ to take the scenic backroads back to our resort. \n\nOn to another short flight\
  \ to Chiang Mai further North. We stayed in the old city area and we're impressed\
  \ with the old Thai culture and beauty here. Ancient temples with so much history.\
  \ Women must wear appropriate clothing to enter, most have clothing to borrow. I\
  \ didn't so much mind as they were quite beautiful. We lucked out and were there\
  \ on a weekend, we headed to the huge night market. Live music, henna art, grilled\
  \ fish, beer, little vendors everywhere. The sights, the sounds, the smells ...it\
  \ was exactly as I imagined Thailand. I sat in a tented area eating my grilled whole\
  \ fish and a beer in hand dreaming about moving here one day. \n\nOur last full\
  \ day we headed back to Bangkok and headed to the party scene of Khaosan rd. Lots\
  \ of bars and street foods. Think fried grasshoppers, scorpions, etc. This street\
  \ is filled with youngsters travelling from all over the world.\n\nIf you asked\
  \ me what was the best trip you've ever been on? Thailand would be it! Thai people\
  \ are very kind. Buddhism is a way of life. The land is beautiful but its the culture\
  \ that makes Thailand \U0001F1F9\U0001F1ED. I definitely will go back maybe next\
  \ time for a longer stay."
