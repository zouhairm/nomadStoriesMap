Text: "The name itself has the ability to conjure a certain amount of trepidation,\
  \ never mind the written descriptions of the descent. The Devil\u2019s Pulpit, or\
  \ Finnich Glen to give the proper name had been on my mind for some time. Now, heading\
  \ to this secluded location in the passenger seat of my closest friend\u2019s car,\
  \ the tantalising visions of half remembered photos filled my mind.\n\nIt had been\
  \ an uncommonly hot and sunny month for Scotland. The usually misty and muted but\
  \ no less beautiful landscapes suddenly enlivened by heat and intense light; greens\
  \ of such vivid intensity as to have an almost otherworldly quality. An almost dizzying\
  \ assault on my senses used to the seemingly unending drizzle and grey of Glasgow.\n\
  \nAs we got closer to the site I found it increasingly difficult to mask my disappointment.\
  \ All nearby laybys and grass verges were packed with cars; lots of people when\
  \ I had been expecting none. Nonetheless, we made the short walk that lead to the\
  \ potentially treacherous steps down into the gorge. The descent, though not pleasant\
  \ was, thanks to the preceding days of sun, mercifully dry.\n\nAny disillusionment\
  \ I had felt evaporated upon first site of the gorge proper. No image nor story\
  \ could have prepared me for the magic unfolding before my eyes. Verdant moss covered\
  \ rock faces in eerie contrast with the bloody river that had riven it\u2019s way\
  \ through the land. It no longer mattered that there were others down here. I felt\
  \ a sudden sense of peace I rarely experience, a feeling that for me, is synonymous\
  \ with home and a kind of ancestral belonging to these wild places. Mouth agape,\
  \ I stood in awe attempting to comprehend that which lay before me. Returning to\
  \ my senses we began to make our way up river.\n\nIt quickly became apparent that\
  \ staying dry was a pointless mission if we wished to properly experience all that\
  \ this wondrous place had to offer. Forgoing my usual accidental dips and emboldened\
  \ by the hot sun I waded merrily through the shallow water. My seemingly flippant\
  \ choice of jelly sandals proved to be perfect. People from across the globe were\
  \ each enjoying this natural spectacle in their own ways and yet it did not feel\
  \ too much. Laughter rang through the gorge, interspersed with occasional excited\
  \ whooping. There was friendly chat and camaraderie between the groups, a spell\
  \ had been cast.\n\nHigher up, the river formed pools and the once blood red of\
  \ the water blackened with depth. Mysterious and slightly foreboding they were enticing\
  \ all the same. A siren call to the heat wilted walker. My friend was reticent but\
  \ my own fears of dark water had inexplicably vanished and I slid from the rock\
  \ into the shockingly cold water. I could not discern how deep the pool was but\
  \ felt unafraid. Within the inky embrace of the water I felt vital, at once a witness\
  \ and a part of nature, the universe.\n\nFeeling refreshed and buoyant we decided\
  \ to make our way downstream. Everything around and within me shone with divine,\
  \ supernatural light. It had been a long time since I had experienced such euphoria\
  \ and I bathed in the feeling. I walked confidently over rocks, splashing through\
  \ the shallows. Caught off guard, my foot slid between two large slabs of sandstone.\
  \ I was instantly aware that something was very wrong. Intense pain shot through\
  \ my foot and I almost slipped into unconsciousness. My friend kept talking, trying\
  \ to elicit a response but the shock easy such that I could not speak nor cry out\
  \ in pain. An American college student we had met earlier helped my friend walk\
  \ me over rocks and I swam through the areas we could not traverse together. Adrenalin\
  \ had taken effect by now and I made my way up the steps of the gorge on my bottom.\
  \ Fortune and the kindness of strangers came to my aid once again in the form of\
  \ a piggyback from a Canadian student who kindly saw me along the path whilst my\
  \ friend brought the car. I can\u2019t begin to imagine the alternative if I\u2019\
  d got my wish of a deserted Devil\u2019s Pulpit."
