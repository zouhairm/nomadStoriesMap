Text: "I was hiking last year in France, at the centre of the famous \"Massif Central\"\
  : the highlands of the Causses. After 8 hours of travelling during night-time, I\
  \ arrived at a hostel in which only three people were staying. The owner sincerely\
  \ warned me that it was a busy period, and she was almost intimidated by that. From\
  \ that moment on, I should have understood where I had come to. My  eyes tried to\
  \ blur my view, but it couldn\u2019t last long. I didn\u2019t know, well, I couldn\u2019\
  t, but I soon did. \nI did not expect to dazzle while facing the nothing. Leaving\
  \ my room, a less noisy wind than the silence, along with that austere landscape\
  \ grabbed my stare at once. I felt my eyelids curl up at once: the dazzling lights\
  \ hit my skin hard. All of a sudden,  my pre-imagined expectations were reversed:\
  \  I realized what I could never have imagined. The Causses are not the cradle of\
  \ a natural hubbub, where mother nature concentrates all the crackling of the leaves\
  \ and the noisy gems of wild animals. The Causses are a silent land because no one\
  \ dares speak in front of its inhuman beauty and terror combined. I had to feel\
  \ this experience to discern the \u201Csublimation\u201D of the Causses. \nI didn\u2019\
  t know that in a revolving and globalized world, you could happen to find loneliness\
  \ instead of solitude. In the Causses, Nature had brutally deprived me of my habits,\
  \ so I started everything from scratch. For instance, I woke up every day at sunrise\
  \ and walked until sunset; I observed birds for hours without never being bored.\
  \ Concisely, I was illuminated by a priceless \u201Cbanality\u201D."
