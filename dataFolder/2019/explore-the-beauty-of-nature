Text: "Travel is life...the refreshing wind ..nature new people food and what not\
  \ .. that's the life ..I travel that keep me activite jolly and open book ... the\
  \ true connection between nature and human...the real fact around myself all I can\
  \ find the real me how I can deal with all these adventurous thing. traveling is\
  \ the spirit of happiness..the real experience of life starts when you travel more\
  \ and think less..my traveling story is not a preplanned Destination most of the\
  \ ways are so Called destination without destination...or travel like there's no\
  \ destination.different place different food different culture different people\
  \ excite me more ... photography ,food and traveling are in my life blood ....I\
  \ study to travel ...and even think of jobs to obviously for travel ...I believe\
  \ traveling is not just only going abroad it can be anywhere...just pack your bags\
  \ and boom get set go !I hear the incessant pounding of a drum as we walk around\
  \ the corner towards our guesthouse. A man steps in front of me, his face is elaborately\
  \ painted with colored powders. His mouth is wide open. A knife pierces his cheek\
  \ with the handle pressed against his tongue and the knife\u2019s point is now staring\
  \ at me. His hand is outstretched for baksheesh. My jaw drops open in awe and I\
  \ internally muse that it must be easy to cut and chew his dinner at the same time\
  \ as the knife is indeed genuine.\n\nWe arrive early in the morning at Hospet, the\
  \ closest railway station to Hampi, after an overnight ride from Bangalore. Few\
  \ tourists, and people from different states  for that matter, have heard of Hampi\n\
  \nbut those that have, enthusiastically endorse it as a must-see destination in\
  \ India.\n\nKnown as the City of Ruins, Hampi is a village located in India\u2019\
  s state of Karnataka, situated about halfway between Bangalore and Bombay. If you\
  \ folded a map of India lengthwise, Hampi would fall somewhere near the crease in\
  \ the south.i went to banarghhata national park as well as Bangalore palace ...I\
  \ have been to Kolkata, Hyderabad and many parts of India ... traveling is a mind\
  \ thing if you think of going somewhere then just pack your bags and move no opinions\
  \ suggestions no questions no excuses nothing...when a mind decide something just\
  \ do it man and that's what exactly I believe about traveling ...that's my weakness\
  \ as well as my strength ...the only thing why am up for always"
