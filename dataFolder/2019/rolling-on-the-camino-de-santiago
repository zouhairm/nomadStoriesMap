Text: "The Camino de Santiago is a spiritual route of medieval origin whose purpose\
  \ is to reach the tomb of the apostle Santiago el Mayor, located in the crypt of\
  \ the cathedral of Santiago de Compostela in Galicia, Spain.\nThe routes have become\
  \ popular cyclists and walkers and as a spiritual path.\nLike everything in life,\
  \ there\u2019s always a margin for error. So of course, I began my adventure through\
  \ Europe half a day late. I forgot to reserve a place for my bike on the train and\
  \ lost my ticket!\n\n\u201CThese things happen for a reason,\u201D I thought to\
  \ myself. But, in the back of my mind I was frustrated and nervous I would not be\
  \ able to finish my journey to Santiago, Spain from France.\n\nThe delay allowed\
  \ me to tour Paris by bike, visit the Eiffel Tower, and spend time with my friend\
  \ Paola and her husband who live in Paris.  After securing my bike reservation and\
  \ ticket for the next day to Bayonne, France, I felt much better. I did not miss\
  \ the train this time!\n\nI arrived in Bayonne and put together my bicycle that\
  \ had been packed in a bike bag just in time to make the bus to Saint Jean Pied\
  \ de Port, France. Without further mishap, I was at my destination with blue sky\
  \ and fabulous weather to welcome me as I started my journey to Santiago.\n\nPeople\
  \ from all over the world were at the pilgrim\u2019s office in Saint Jean Pied de\
  \ Port to start their adventure on the Camino de Santiago. Most of them were walkers,\
  \ but there was also one other cyclist. \nThe first stage was 30 kilometers with\
  \ about 18 kilometers of climbing through the Pyrenees on a winding road with an\
  \ incredible landscape. Shortly before the end of the day, I caught up to two Italians,\
  \ Antonio and Sandro, who were part of a group of six also starting their Camino\
  \ de Santiago pilgrimage. I thought no one would be crazy enough to be starting\
  \ their ride as late in the day as I did, but I ended up finding six!\nThe hostel\
  \ in Roncesvalles was the first stop, but there was no place to sleep there so I\
  \ would have to keep looking. Again, I found myself running into the Italians and\
  \ together searched for and found a hostel to stay in for the night. We woke to\
  \ a rainy day and, considering the route planned for the day, I decided to accept\
  \ the Italian\u2019s invitation and ride with them. It was the start of a great\
  \ friendship \u2013 from that moment they adopted me as part of their group for\
  \ 12 days.\nI once read a phrase that I remember perfectly: It says, if no one wants\
  \ to accompany you on your journey, go alone, you will find companions on the road.\
  \ I had no idea this would happen to me, but it did on the Camino de Santiago. I\
  \ arrived alone and on the trip, I met great people who would become my friends.\
  \ When my plans were initially delayed and I couldn\u2019t get on the train, it\
  \ was fate that had made other plans for me.\nThe following days after Lorca we\
  \ continued to enjoy great landscapes, climbing up and zooming down mountains. \n\
  \nThe longest day of the trip was 123 km from Villa Franca to Carre\xF3n de los\
  \ Condes. That day\u2019s ride was longer than expected because the village we were\
  \ supposed to stop at didn\u2019t have water. \n\nSo kilometer after kilometer,\
  \ I was fulfilling my goal. I saw many beautiful cathedrals along the way \u2013\
  \ in Pamplona Burgos, the wonderful gothic architecture in Leon, Astorga and its\
  \ surroundings, and the climb to the Iron Cross carrying a small stone to make a\
  \ wish, as tradition goes. And finally, I came upon the cathedral of Santiago de\
  \ Compostela.\n\nOn a rainy day, my journey came to a very emotional finish in the\
  \ square of Santiago. I could not contain the tears of emotion for having been able\
  \ to make the bike route after so long without doing something like that.\nThis\
  \ trip in Spain by bike was an adventure that exceeded all my expectations."
