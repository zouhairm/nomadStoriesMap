Text: "I looked at my friend and said, \u201CI think I should go back.\u201D He responded\
  \ with a cheeky smile, \u201CYou\nwon\u2019t get a refund though.\u201D After a\
  \ routine flight from Mumbai to Delhi, we made our way to the\ncrowded bus depot.\
  \ Amidst the hustle and bustle, I realized I was deep diving into unknown\nterritory.\
  \ It was the 4th semester of my MBA course. But here I was bunking classes so that\
  \ I could\nembark on a week-long trip to Spiti Valley.\nAs the bus cruised into\
  \ the beautiful countryside, I found myself in a blissful reverie. Random\nthoughts\
  \ on love and life gracefully merged with the scenic images of lush green forest\
  \ and intricate\ngravel pathways. Once we reached Manali, I felt enveloped by an\
  \ old world charm. Beautiful\ntrinkets, snug shawls, colorful mufflers and cozy\
  \ sweaters adorned the small shops that dotted\nthe spacious boulevard which the\
  \ locals called the town center.\nNext day at the crack of dawn we were on our way\
  \ to Spiti in a rented SUV with the driver doubling up as our\nguide. It was a rather\
  \ bumpy ride but we were determined to snap beautiful images of the\nbreathtaking\
  \ scenery as we held onto our smartphones for dear life.\nIt was chilly and foggy\
  \ at Rohtang Pass. A sudden tyre puncture meant braving the bone-freezing\nconditions\
  \ while sipping \u2018pahadi chai\u2019 (mountain tea).\nWe got stuck for hours\
  \ in an unexpected mountain roadblock. It was a steep S shaped path jutting\nout\
  \ of the mighty cliff face. There was a spectacular waterfall at the spot where\
  \ the vehicles from\nthe opposite sides crossed each other. But a heavily laden\
  \ truck got stuck in the big rocks as the\ncrystal clear water flowed across the\
  \ road and down the depths of the ravine. Our guide asked us to\nremove our shoes\
  \ and cross the icy stretch of water lest our SUV suffers the same fate. Dipping\
  \ my\nbare feet into the icy pool and crossing it while making a human chain was\
  \ one of the craziest\nexperiences of my life.\nAt an altitude of 4587 meters, Kaza\
  \ is the highest village in the world. Tabo Monastery which is more\nthan 1000 years\
  \ old is nicely nestled among the hills of Tabo Village. It was a steep climb to\
  \ see this\nmagnificent shrine. Later we trekked a short distance and reached Dhankar\
  \ where it seemed so\npeaceful sitting by the azure blue lake.\nEarly next day we\
  \ headed out to see the World\u2019s highest post office at Hikkim. At an elevation\
  \ of\n4440 meters, the one room post office was spacious enough to entertain tourists\
  \ who wanted to\npost a letter home as a token of having visited the iconic place.\n\
  Next stop was Langza where I was about to spend one entire day without any mobile\
  \ connectivity.\nThe accommodation at Langza was a small cottage with three rooms\
  \ and a rickety ladder to\ntransport us to the roof if the need arose. I found myself\
  \ glued to the scenic view of the lush green\nhillside while I sat in eerie silence\
  \ on the roof.\nAt night, there was no light anywhere other than at the cottage\
  \ and the washroom was situated\noutside at a minor elevation. Late at night we\
  \ saw a blinding flash of light zip past our window across\nthe dark countryside.\
  \ We were paralyzed with fear and barely slept a wink. Next morning, I fell down\n\
  the smooth slope connecting the washroom with the cottage. The others had a good\
  \ laugh. It was\na fun-filled but scary experience of spending a night at Langza,\
  \ one that evoked all sorts of emotions\nwithin me. \nOur final stop was Chandratal\
  \ Lake where we put up at Parasol camps near the lake. At freezing\ntemperatures,\
  \ the campsite personnel provided hot food, warm blankets and morning tea to all\
  \ the\ncampers. The next day we bid adieu to enchanting Spiti and began our journey\
  \ back to Manali.\nThe exhilarating experience of delving into the unknown, discovering\
  \ yourself while exploring\nuninhibited beautiful wilderness and that too with barely\
  \ known travelers is something that I will cherish\nfor the rest of my life."
