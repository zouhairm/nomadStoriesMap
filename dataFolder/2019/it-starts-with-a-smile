Text: "One by one I open my eyes, readying myself for the day. I partake in my typical\
  \ morning routine, tying my hair back as I brush my teeth and run water over my\
  \ face. I step into a white flowy dress, secure my sandals around my ankles and\
  \ fly out the door.\n\nI walk quickly down the dirt road to the bus stop in Mirissa.\
  \ While waiting for the bus, noticing the humidity in the morning air, I make conversation\
  \ with the Russian girl from my hostel. I\u2019ll be spending the day with her after\
  \ all.\n\nWith beads of sweat building above my lip, the bus arrives \u2013 only\
  \ slowing down as we\u2019re quickly urged to board and find a seat in the uniquely\
  \ decorated vehicle. I\u2019ve been on one of these buses before, so I know what\
  \ to expect, yet my eyes are still drawn to the bright colours and designs painted\
  \ along the walls and interior of the roof. I also can\u2019t help but notice the\
  \ local music playing in the background.\n\nI don\u2019t speak much to the Russian\
  \ girl, as she\u2019s self conscious of her English and stares blankly ahead. Every\
  \ few minutes passengers get up and walk clumsily towards the front of the bus to\
  \ signal to the driver that their stops are approaching. He slows the bus, just\
  \ enough so that they can step off and accelerates quickly again. We\u2019re only\
  \ fifteen minutes into the drive when I turn to my left and see an older local woman\
  \ across the isle, looking my way. I ignore her gaze and pivot back to looking out\
  \ the window again.\n\nA minute later, I feel a body pressed next to mine as the\
  \ woman moves from her seat across, to sit beside me. She smiles but doesn\u2019\
  t say a word. Her warm brown eyes glisten in the sunlight. She has kind eyes, I\
  \ think to myself. I smile back politely.\n\nThe bus continues on, driving quickly\
  \ and honking loudly as it overtakes cars and tuk tuks left and right. As soon as\
  \ I become lost in my own thoughts again, the woman looks at me and asks what country\
  \ I\u2019m from. I tell her that I\u2019m Canadian. I can tell immediately that\
  \ her English is poor and assume the conversation will end how it started, with\
  \ a smile.\n\nTo my surprise, she continues asking questions about me. I reciprocate\
  \ and slowly learn about her, beginning with her name, Sumithra. \u201CThat\u2019\
  s a nice name\u201D, I tell her. I see her face light up as she thanks me. The ride\
  \ continues and I learn about Sumithra\u2019s husband. She also tells me about her\
  \ daughter \u2013 who is apparently very bright. We continue talking and whenever\
  \ she has trouble understanding me, she says \u201CI\u2019m sorry \u2026 I don\u2019\
  t understand\u201D and we both laugh awkwardly. The same happens when she can\u2019\
  t find the right words in English to express her thoughts.\n\nI slowly gather little\
  \ bits and pieces about Sumithra\u2019s life in Sri Lanka. It\u2019s clearly much\
  \ different than my life in Canada. She doesn\u2019t have much, but she\u2019s happy.\
  \ She can see my privilege and all she wants is to get to know me.\n\nAs we get\
  \ closer to Galle, she asks me something, but I don\u2019t understand. After a few\
  \ more failed attempts and interruptions from the intermittent honking of the bus,\
  \ she reaches into her bag and digs around for a pen and paper. She finds both and\
  \ writes down \u201Caddras, telepone and name\u201D. I finally understand and write\
  \ down my information in return. She looks at me smiling and says, \u201CI\u2019\
  m going to send you a letter\u201D. I can\u2019t help but smile as well and ask\
  \ for her information in case she loses mine.\n\nI look out the window and realise\
  \ we\u2019ve made it to Galle. We get off and before parting ways, Sumithra places\
  \ my hand in hers, looks at me once again with her kind eyes and a smile saying,\
  \ \u201CI\u2019ll see you soon\u201D."
