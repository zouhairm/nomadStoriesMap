Text: "Do you know there's a saying ; \"The journey of a thousand miles begins with\
  \ a single step?\"\n\n\nMy journey begin in 2018 when I had to choose my 'inner\
  \ peace' instead of money. \nOn 25 February 2018, I moved to a small yet famous\
  \ city Yogyakarta. I came to Yogyakarta to work in a NGO, actually I lived in Yogyakarta\
  \ since 2013 but when  graduated I move to the capital and after almost two years\
  \ I'm back to Yogyakarta.\n\nYogyakarta is a small city compared to Jakarta, but\
  \ Yogyakarta is a famous destination for travelling too. \nHere, you can found almost\
  \ everything ; culture, foods, history, monarchy, nature, and etc.\nEven though\
  \ I lived in Yogyakarta for more than 3 years, I haven't visited all the tourist\
  \ attractions here, because there's so many great tourist attractions that you have\
  \ to visit if you are in Yogyakarta!\nBut one day, when I took a day off, suddenly\
  \ I want to go to 'somewhere' , I want to explore my neighborhood (because this\
  \ is a new neighborhood for me) and I heard that there's a unique museum near my\
  \ place, it's called \"Ullen Sentalu Museum\". Well, It was the first time I heard\
  \ about the museum, but people said it's quite famous for some people whose admire\
  \ Arts. \nThe 'Ullen Sentalu Museum' placed really far away from a city, it's placed\
  \ near the mountain. \n\nWhen I arrived in the museum, I was shocked ! The museum\
  \ has unique architecture design. After bought the ticket, there will be a tour\
  \ guide to guided you traveling around the museum. You'll be divided into some group\
  \ and no worries there is a  choice for language that will be use by the tour guide.\
  \   And you know what? It turned out that 'Ullen Sentalu Museum' is an underground\
  \ museum! Inside the museum we can see the true culture, history and art or Yogyakarta.\
  \ There's so many Batik which originally belonged to the Sultan (Sultan is a king\
  \ in Yogyakarta) and the Royal family. There are also some painting which also belong\
  \ to the Royal family (some of them was a gift). While walked down the underground\
  \ museum there are various kinds of beautiful sculptures too, and many more.\nAnd\
  \ because it was a long way, in the middle of the tour there's a rest room for visitors\
  \ and when we reach the half way of the museum they will let us take some rest there\
  \ and they also gave a traditional royal drink from ancient times.\n\nAnd when finished\
  \ traveling the underground museum, you'll be surprised because we will be welcomed\
  \ by a magnificent garden! That's really a work of arts!\nUnfortunately, we can't\
  \ take photos  inside the museum. The museum staff said that, because everything\
  \ inside the museum is genuine, in order to maintain confidentiality and keep it\
  \ from plagiarism, visitors who come are prohibited from taking photos.\n\nBut no\
  \ worries, you won't forget and regret the magnificent experience there !"
