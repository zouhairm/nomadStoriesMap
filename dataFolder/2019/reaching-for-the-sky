Text: "It was only from the top that one could grasp the true essence of that mystical\
  \ place. That silent spirit that endured the rise and fall of civilizations, and\
  \ that still breaths today in every step of the great pyramids of Teotihuacan. \n\
  \nHere, most people come together, not to remember the ancestral festivities of\
  \ the original settlers, the Mexicas, but rather to fill up their spirits with the\
  \ energy of this ancient city during the Vernal equinox. Many of this visitors,\
  \ nonetheless, do manage to feel a special connection with their roots and almost\
  \ effortlessly, they are transported to those remote times before the Spanish conquest.\
  \ They see the fire lightning the halls, they feel the uproar of the merchants,\
  \ and are brought back to the present moment by the fierce sound of the jaguar.\
  \ \n\nSimilar to our New Year\u2019s Eve celebration, the people from Teotihuacan\
  \ commemorated the Yankuik Xiwitl, around 2200 years ago. It marked the beginning\
  \ of a new cycle every year, and consisted of five days of fast and remembrance,\
  \ the Nemontemi, and five days of celebration. After this  ceremonial days, they\
  \ welcomed the beginning of Spring and cherished the Xiwitiotianitztl, the herb\
  \ festival. \n\nNowadays, local people still come to witness the majestic sunsets\
  \ and sunrises, sitting on the steps of the pyramid of the Sun or climbing all the\
  \ way to the top and opening their arms and hearts to receive the healing energy,\
  \ washing away the bad luck and the sorrows. Regardless of their age, everyone comes\
  \ with the goal of strengthening their awareness, and remember the virtues that\
  \ make us human. \n\nAnother highlight of this short getaway (it\u2019s just 45\
  \ minutes from Mexico City!) is the local restaurants that offer traditional food\
  \ from the region. La Gruta Restaruante, caught my attention the most. A restaurant\
  \ inside a cave that fits around 500 people, offering live music and folkloric Mexican\
  \ dances for a delightful way to wrap up the day. \n \nEveryone experiences this\
  \ place in their own personal way but, visiting Teotihuacan pyramids is a must when\
  \ coming to the Mexico City area, especially if you are here around the dates of\
  \ the equinox. So, pack your sunscreen, a bottle of water and get ready to be reborn\
  \ in this sacred land."
