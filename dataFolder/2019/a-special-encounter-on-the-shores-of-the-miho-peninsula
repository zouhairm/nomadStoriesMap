Text: "Above me: an immaculate blue sky, dotted with only a handful of fluffy white\
  \ clouds just merely visible deep into the horizon. \n\nIn front of me: the vast\
  \ ocean, just as far-reaching as the azure expanse above it, stretching out into\
  \ what seems like infinity. \n\nAround me: a sea of pebbles, each a witness to the\
  \ passage of countless millennia, perfectly polished by the caresses of a billion\
  \ waves.  \n\nBehind me: lush deep green rows of majestic pine trees, standing tall\
  \ and proud, acting as guardians of the masterpiece stretching across far and wide.\
  \ A scene too magnificent to be processed by the naked eye alone, I tried soaking\
  \ it all in by putting my sensory organs to work. The salty breeze charged with\
  \ a near-electric tingle, the sound of the tide licking the shore, the sharp rays\
  \ of the sun hitting down on me. I could feel all my senses being awakened. Never\
  \ had I felt so relaxed yet so stimulated at the same time. \n\nI could not detect,\
  \ for kilometers around, a single other human soul anywhere on the beach. I had\
  \ a special rendezvous with the raw beauty of mother nature, in its most powerful\
  \ though most vulnerable form. I could hear it whispering to me. The January wind\
  \ blew frigid, slashing across my cheeks and numbing my jaw. I felt no pain or discomfort,\
  \ only a strong urge to lend my ears and eyes to what it had to tell me. \n\nI sat\
  \ down on the rocky shore, facing the water, and felt myself absorbed in a strange\
  \ energy. All of the stress and fatigue that had been weighing on my shoulders suddenly\
  \ evaporated into the marine air. Catharsis.\n\nShaken back to my senses by a growling\
  \ stomach, I thought it wise to slowly make my way back to civilization lest I pass\
  \ out on this empty beach with no one to come to my rescue. The sun was much lower\
  \ in the sky, and it wouldn\u2019t be long before it began to set, but wanting to\
  \ savor every last bit of brightness the day had to offer, I walked slowly. I saluted\
  \ the ocean, Mount Fuji, the pebbles, the pine trees, and a part of me that I left\
  \ behind to be washed away by the rising tide. I didn\u2019t make it back to the\
  \ city before dark, and was baffled when I realized an entire day had gone by. Completely\
  \ absorbed by my surroundings and the magical experience, I hadn\u2019t even had\
  \ a single bite to eat. I knew that what I had witnessed that day was very special,\
  \ and that it would live on inside of me long after I left Japan.\n\nLittle had\
  \ I known when I set out in the morning, just wanting to catch glimpse of the iconic\
  \ snow capped volcano, that I would end up having such a humbling and reinvigorating\
  \ encounter with Dame Nature. Upon waking up, I had the option of hopping right\
  \ onto a bus departing from Shizuoka station just a few steps away from my hostel,\
  \ which would've taken me to a well-known tourist spot promising \u201Camazing views\u201D\
  \ as per the thousands of reviews left behind by eager visitors all over the internet.\
  \ I also had the choice of setting out into the unknown to a more remote location\
  \ without the same guarantee of fabulous sights, and on a less convenient itinerary\
  \ with nos bus to take me straight to my destination. Opting for that second option\
  \ made all the difference. \n\nMoments like these capture the very essence of traveling.\
  \ So raw, rich, and powerful. However short-lived, their impact on us are often\
  \ infinitely stronger and longer lasting than most experiences we go through in\
  \ the course of our regular routines. This is why we set off into the unknown--to\
  \ break away from the sights, sounds, and smells that are familiar to us. To make\
  \ meaningful encounters. To grow. I am forever grateful for that day I spent on\
  \ the shores of the Miho Peninsula in Shizuoka on a cold January day. These memories\
  \ have carved themselves into my very being and will follow me wherever I go."
