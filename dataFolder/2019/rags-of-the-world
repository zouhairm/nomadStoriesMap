Text: "It was 50 years ago, my first dream't that the world must be big, for me to\
  \ see,  will be impossible. I am a farmers daughter at day, a fishermans at night.\
  \  In me I dreams of many.  I see the world throught the books and magazines.  I\
  \ wished of so many, night and day I see them beautifully.  Now in my fifties I\
  \ traveled to a few countries. In this experinces I find myself that I traveled!\
  \ what's in it that makes me want to go! why I savor to witness the difference from\
  \ me to them, I found country to country each have there own beauty, from cultured,\
  \ to food, to nature, and to the people that resides.  \nIn the busy street of Paris,\
  \ to the delicious french onion soup and crunchy fries, I feel in love, love of\
  \ the sounds and love of his history.  Moving on to Barcelona with a beautiful display\
  \ of tapas, food so enticing not having a taste of will keep you awake at night.\
  \  I wished I could travel documents all that I see.  This was a dream I have at\
  \ 10 years of age, now in my late 50's my dream continues one at a time.  \n\nLourdes"
