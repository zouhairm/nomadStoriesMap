Text: "Uzbekistan - was my first trip abroad (after it you can not break somewhere).\
  \ When my superiors informed me about this and that I was going to represent our\
  \ company at the exhibition, I was very happy. Uzbek culture, traditions, people,\
  \ cuisine and everything belonging to them interested me from a young age, and it\
  \ would be very cool to go and see all this! \nAnd so, we all, the Kyrgyz delegation\
  \ passed registration, crossed the border and boarded the train .. With each movement\
  \ of this high-speed transport, I am waiting for some miracle, smiling with a Cheshire\
  \ cat smile. Traveling is a new breath, new feelings, sensations, learning and just\
  \ soul satisfaction. \"Though not very famous and big country,\" I thought, \"rich\
  \ culture and fascinating history - this is interesting!\" \nWhen I arrived in the\
  \ city of Andijan, where even deep in the night lights and various lamps were burning\
  \ brightly, I remember that there are many statues of animals of the Turkic people\
  \ in this city, clean roads and sidewalks and animated by its citizens. It was time\
  \ to go and catch the next train to Tashkent, the capital of this country. My views\
  \ could not abate. So I waited to breathe the cool air of Tashkent and admire its\
  \ history-filled areas. As expected, I was waited there by museums of national heroes,\
  \ fairs with works of artisans, delicious and fragrant seasoning cuisine and a special\
  \ atmosphere of national music. I visited parks that were decorated with various\
  \ bushes and varieties of flowers, swept for the first time on the subway, serving\
  \ as the main transport for the population, appreciated the gilded chandelier with\
  \ rock crystal weighing one ton in the Amir Temur Museum and walked through the\
  \ Chorsuu bazaar. How exciting it was! As if I had penetrated into the essence of\
  \ this magnificent country, became its part. It was after these feelings that I\
  \ realized that traveling for a person is a medicine that acts positively on everyone\
  \ and leaves only the warmest traces on the heart. These 3 days were the most amazing,\
  \ because a new round for the soul is equal to healing."
