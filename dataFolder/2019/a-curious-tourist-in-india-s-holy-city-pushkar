Text: "A vast expanse of sand and arid land, the occasional fortress atop a\ndistant\
  \ hilltop, thorny bushes, and ferociously horned cattle drawing\ntruck-tired carts,\
  \ our introduction to Rajasthan was full of visual\ndelights from the train window.\
  \ As the train crawled 5 hours late, our\nlunch plans at\_Ajmer\_were settled in\
  \ favor of the humble thali of\nIndian railways, the staple dal chawal and colored\
  \ soup that passes\noff as curry.\n\nAjmer\_is definitely a noisy but colorful city.\
  \ As we alighted from\nour train compartments, brushing part several veiled women\
  \ in\ncolorful sarees and robust men with as robust white headgear, we\nrealized\
  \ we\u2019ve reached the land of Rajputs. There was almost a scuffle\nbetween autowallahs\
  \ and taxis trying to woo us, but we remained stiff\ntill they dispersed and finally\
  \ chose a tonga (horse cart). 300 bucks\nfor not even 6 km, we smelt a rip-off but\
  \ agreed nonetheless looking\nat the keen owner and the sad horse.\n\nThe Historical\
  \  Old City\n\nWe headed straight to the\_Ajmer\_Dargah, and the bylanes of shops\
  \ in\nthe neighborhood were just waking up to the day. This small shrine,\ncalled\
  \ the\_Ajmer\_Sharif is the dargah of celebrated saint Moinuddin\nChishti. It is\
  \ said that the shrine is famed for childless couples\npraying here and being blessed\
  \ with an offspring. Even Akbar the Great\nused to come here by foot along with\
  \ his queen, in observation of a\nvow when he prayed for a son and had his wish\
  \ fulfilled. A furlong away is the Adhai-Din-ka-Jhopra, a fine\nmonument and an\
  \ architectural marvel of the Indo-Saracenic style. The\ncomplexity and beauty of\
  \ the stone latticework are seen to be believed.\n\nPushkar Ghat\n\nWe headed next\
  \ to Pushkar, 11 km away from\_Ajmer. This is a must for\npilgrimage by Hindus.\
  \ Cool breeze surrounds the lake which has several platforms and steps on which\
  \ many\nHindu rituals take place. Just taking a dip in the water is\nrefreshing.\
  \ From there we did a darshan of the Brahma temple, supposed\nto be the only one\
  \ in the whole of India.\n\nThe Pink Floyd Cafe\n\nLocated close to Ranganathswamy\
  \ Temple, this quaint caf\xE9 that has\ncreated a name for itself among foreign\
  \ tourists is deep inside a\nsmall bylane. You have to follow meandering lane after\
  \ lane to reach a\ndead end where the cafe is situated. It also doubles up as a\n\
  guesthouse where all the rooms are named after the band\u2019s albums. You\ncould\
  \ sit downstairs on a sofa, sip seesha, listen to the fabulous\nmusic and served\
  \ your order. But for the best views trudge up the\nnarrow steps to the roof, where\
  \ you get fabulous views of Pushkar\nLake. The terrace has a garden of potted plants\
  \ and done up with\nexotic d\xE9cor from the sub-continet\u2014think colorful Buddhist\
  \ flags,\ndurries, and hanging lamps. They serve fabulous Italian and\nMediterranean\
  \ cuisine and their milkshakes are as great.\n\nFinal Leg\n\nAfter the small repast,\
  \ we returned to the main road where our cab was\nparked. The driver, who was at\
  \ a tea-shop came rushing and tried to\nshoo something away from under the car.\
  \ As we watched a beautiful\npeacock emerged, and with its blue flowing robe, ascended\
  \ a nearby\nwall effortlessly and vanished while glaring at the driver with deep\n\
  suspicion. Magical!\n\nSo what is it, that makes tourists, especially foreign tourists\
  \ throng\nPushkar\u2014I kept wondering as I saw rows of foreigners having a good\n\
  time in the town\u2019s street. Often they lounge around street food\neateries,\
  \ where along with the samosas and kachoris, you could order garlic and tomato flavored\
  \ Maggi or pasta. \u201CCheap n Easy Weed,\u201D my\ndriver whispered. Maybe yes,\
  \ maybe no. But I refused to believe him\nfor once. Nobody comes here in scorching\
  \ 40\xB0 C+ sun to enjoy weed. Maybe it\u2019s the holy vibe that the city gives\
  \ out, the lure of\nunderstanding India and the ancient Hinduism, or just to soak\
  \ in the\ncolors and smell of the real India, I will never know."
