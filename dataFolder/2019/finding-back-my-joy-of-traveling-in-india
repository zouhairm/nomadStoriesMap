Text: "When it comes to traveling, India is not on the top of my list of places to\
  \ go. I heard horror stories of narrow roads packed with motorbikes, cars, rickshaws,\
  \ tuk-tuks, and cows. Yes, big mammals roaming around freely on the streets; no\
  \ thanks. \n\nI guess my sense of adventure has diminished significantly over the\
  \ year. I used to say: \"wow, that seems interesting, let's check it out\" when\
  \ it comes to facing an environment that I'm not used to. Nowadays, I'm like \"\
  Nah, let's go where everyone goes and have a \"safe & guaranteed\" good times. No\
  \ stress, no hassle. \n\nBut I had the opportunity to visit India for the first\
  \ time last month. Not out of my personal choice or desire, but business obligation.\
  \ I own a coworking space and it happens that Asia's best coworking conference is\
  \ happening in Goa, India this year. So I packed my bags to get on the plane and\
  \ fly to the world's second most populous country. \n\nThe first that I noticed\
  \ the colors. People in India wear colorful outfits no matter who they are. Beautiful\
  \ sarees wore by women and guys adorning bright-colored shirts paired with a sarong.\
  \ I find it very enticing and unique. I spent the first few days in the Panaji,\
  \ Goa and it completely shattered my preconception of India.  The streets are packed\
  \ with vehicles yes, but also very pedestrian-friendly. The architecture in Panaji\
  \ is a beautiful blend of the Portuguese and Indian art translated into well-preserved\
  \ historic neighborhoods. \n\nI wandered around and find myself enjoying exploring\
  \ this hued kaleidoscope of colors, smells, sights, noises, and spirits of Panaji.\
  \ I started to see my adventurous side surfacing again. I cut short my time in Panaji\
  \ and decided to hop on a local bus and went to another town in South Goa called\
  \ Colva. It was marvelous. Colva is a not-so-touristy beach town where you can unwind\
  \ and connect again with nature in the simplest way. \n\nDuring the day, the water\
  \ so warm and clear that you only see sparkles. I lost count of the hours I walked\
  \ on its wide stretch of beach, staring at the waves and the endless horizon. When\
  \ it gets too hot, I took cover under a fishing boat. I can't remember the last\
  \ time I feel so free. The breeze, the sound of the ocean, the bright sun, the singing\
  \ fishermen, the laughter of kids; I didn't want to leave. I even loved getting\
  \ on the bus and talking to the locals (which happens to be very chatty and well-spoken).\
  \ And food! Oh, the food is a blessing to my tastebuds. I tried all kinds of curries\
  \ and I ate samosas like it's potato chips. I didn't expect it, but I fell in love\
  \ with traveling again in India. \n\nI learned that joy can be found when you put\
  \ yourself in a place you know nothing about. It's an art, a discipline that can\
  \ be shaped and played with. In India, I learned that true happiness can be found\
  \ when you stop putting yourself in a pedestal. An experience so different than\
  \ what you're comfortable with is not bad or good. But then again, the experience\
  \ is a subjective matter. \n\nIndia surprised me, not because of its so-called \"\
  craziness\" but it enabled me to find my lost joy of simple traveling back, and\
  \ this time, I'll hold on tight to it."
