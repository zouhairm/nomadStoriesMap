Text: "I arrive at the airstrip, bleary-eyed and half asleep. The laid-back attendant\
  \ hands me a waiver form which I scan over and obligingly sign, absolving the tour\
  \ company of any responsibility should anything go wrong. I find myself visually\
  \ assessing the structural integrity of our craft while our pilot sizes each passenger\
  \ up to ensure that weight is evenly distributed throughout the cabin. Others seem\
  \ oblivious and I suddenly find myself wide awake as reality sets in. I\u2019m nothing\
  \ if not an anxious traveler and our plane feels scarcely bigger than an optimist\
  \ sailboat. \n\nI\u2019m hit with an overwhelming wave of fear with subtle undertones\
  \ of excitement as the rickety plane fires up and reaches speed along the runway.\
  \ Our pint-sized plane is noisy, hot and smells strongly of fuel. Us passengers\
  \ make nervous eye contact as we leave the land behind like a paper dart adrift\
  \ on a sea breeze. As we climb to our cruising altitude my nervousness disperses,\
  \ being replaced by adrenaline and awe. We glide along between the sea and the clouds\
  \ while the persistent shadow of our plane dances across the bright blue ocean beneath\
  \ \u2014 a reminder of just how small we are.\n\nI jolt out of a trance-like state\
  \ after observing the sublime and seemingly infinite expanse of ocean and sky to\
  \ the pilot casually mentioning that we\u2019re in for a bumpy landing. My palms\
  \ break into a sweat as we inch closer to Tanna, a volcanic island in Vanuatu. I\
  \ quickly contemplate the distance between the plane and the dense black volcanic\
  \ rock that falls away abruptly into the ocean. I attempt to omit an air of calm\
  \ while frantically assessing my ability to dive out of a nearby door mid-air should\
  \ the need arise. To my relief, we land safely and I clamber out of the plane as\
  \ uncoordinated as a newborn giraffe. \n\nThe air is tinged with the unmistakable\
  \ scent of sulphur as we climb aboard a Land Cruiser that wears the aged patina\
  \ of a vehicle set to live out its days on a wild, volcanic island \u2014 battered\
  \ with high winds and sea spray. We set off with little warning about the journey\
  \ that lies ahead. The ride turns into a wildly unexpected four-wheeled roller coaster\
  \ as our driver embarks down a sludgy, narrow road \u2014 it\u2019s too soon to\
  \ tell if he\u2019s an extremely skilled driver, or completely bat-shit crazy. The\
  \ sweet-scented tropical rain has been torrential this week and we\u2019re soon\
  \ to be confronted with slips, thick jungle and an abundance of oozing iron-rich\
  \ mud. It\u2019s clear that we\u2019re in for the car ride of a lifetime. \n\nAfter\
  \ bouncing through the jungle in our shuttle with shot-springs we emerge to find\
  \ a red, rolling desertscape in front of us. The contrast between where we\u2019\
  ve come from and where we\u2019re headed is unexpected. The road is suddenly stable\
  \ and the Land Cruiser\u2019s wheels begin to rattle their way along the hot gravel\
  \ surface. I can feel the relentless heat radiating from both the sun and the earth\u2019\
  s rocky crust. We wind our way around the base of a giant dune and up the side of\
  \ the mountain. Our guide cuts the engine and parks up, explaining that we\u2019\
  re free to climb the rest of the summit on foot and that we can\u2019t stay long.\
  \ I\u2019m intrigued to know why, but I\u2019m feeling optimistic and something\
  \ tells me I shouldn't ask. \n\nThe door flies open and I peel myself off the cracked\
  \ vinyl seat and slide out of the car in a disorientated daze. I make my way across\
  \ the dry, brittle earth towards the gaping mouth of the volcano. The temperature\
  \ rises with every step and I choke on the hot, acidic, smokey air. An electric\
  \ orange plume of lava launches violently into the sky as our guide amuses himself\
  \ by throwing large rocks into the crater, provoking the volcanoes rage. He\u2019\
  s tempting fate a little too much for my liking. I stroll back to the car, feeling\
  \ like a tiny spec on the face of the earth. I empathise with our trusty plane \u2014\
  \ a flying optimist at first glance."
