Text: "I was a girl with a degree in Public Relations   from a business University.\
  \ I came from a small town in Argentina, full of fields, cows, horses with beautiful\
  \ sunsets just in front of my humble house. \nOne day I decided to travel the world\
  \ to feel another air. New sunsets were waiting for me, definitely. I've been in\
  \ more than 35 countries with beautiful people that conquered my soul. I couldn't\
  \ come back home again with the same mind and heart that I used to have. The world\
  \ has so much to teach I thought. Certainly, I can't choose one story, that changed\
  \ completely my life,   I remember which takes the first place...\n\nIn 2014, I\
  \ traveled to Europe. I went with friends to Ibiza, which is a small island in Spain,\
  \ very famous for the hippies in the 80's and all the music that the island provides\
  \ to the tourism. So many parties and DJs every day making party, 24 hours. From\
  \ Monday until Sunday. I felt in paradise every time that I saw the beaches and\
  \ the beautiful Mediterranean Sea. \nPeople talked about how magical was this place.\
  \ In Ibiza there is a rock that seems a heart, people go there to take wishes, but\
  \ I never believed in that until happened to me. \nI meet a guy, from Portugal that\
  \ Summer. I was in shock with such gentle man day by day. Something inside told\
  \ me he was \"The Man.\" We experienced unforgettable sunsets together between drums,\
  \ music, fresh swimming in Cristal water. He taught me to love deeply and passionately\
  \ without realizing he was doing it. He colored my world with the best combination\
  \ that a woman can imagine. We became best friends in a short time but very intensely,\
  \ definitely. But the time went fast and the day to leave each other arrived.\n\
  We said goodbye with a big hug and so many words that we couldn't say. After all,\
  \ we knew love comes and goes. It is life, experiences with other humans. How many\
  \ time have you feel real love in your life? \nI did this question to me and something\
  \ inside me gave the power to believe in this passion. \nToday I can say, all the\
  \ countries that I went, all the experiences around the word that I have deeply\
  \ in my heart, that made me better person, was with this gentleman that I meet in\
  \ Ibiza, in a crazy summer... \nMy husband, my lovely friend, my favorite human\
  \ in this world.\nThis is my story, the stories of many that show us LOVE doesn't\
  \ have borders. Nemaste"
