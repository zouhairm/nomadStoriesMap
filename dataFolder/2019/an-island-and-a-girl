Text: "I have been to San Andres, Colombia a couple of years ago and I was told it\
  \ was a very poor place with some beautiful views. Well, after spending some time\
  \ in the Island I found out it is actually a very rich place with very rich people.\
  \ They're rich of happyness, faith, education and yes, they're also blessed with\
  \ one of the most beautiful views I have ever seen. \nAt a simple restaurant by\
  \ the ocean I met a girl called Nana who was comming back from school at the same\
  \ time we arrived. She had dark hair and skin, brown eyes and looked very excited\
  \ and happy as she walked by. She was wearing the school uniform which was a white\
  \ shirt and red skirt and she had her backpack in one hand and a school project\
  \ in the other. As she came inside the restaurant, she talked to each one of her\
  \ family members who were working there and then she got inside a room. After 5\
  \ minutes she came back in her bikini and took off for a dive in the ocean. Then\
  \ she came back to the restaurant, had lunch and took her school stuff to finish\
  \ her school project which had been in her hands once she first came in. As I waited\
  \ for my meal and watched the girl's routine I realized that it was probably one\
  \ of the most amazing ways to live life I had ever seen. It was a very simple and\
  \ privileged life at the same time, and I noticed that we are all wrong about our\
  \ life patterns. That should be our pattern. That should be everybody's perfect\
  \ life pursuits. Well, at least I can say it is mine now and I know for sure that\
  \ single Island and girl have changed my whole point of view about life."
