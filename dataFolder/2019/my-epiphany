Text: "I travelled to Mcleodganj with my college friends, Kaneeka and Jyoti. I had\
  \ known about this quiet hill-station in Himachal Pradesh (northern part of India)\
  \ as my brother's safe haven but I could never understand his love for this place\
  \ until last Christmas.\n\nWe boarded a bus from Delhi to Dharamshala, a busy town\
  \ and an hour's drive to the hills. We reached Dharamshala at the crack of dawn\
  \ the next day and took a taxi from there to our destination. As we coiled up the\
  \ mountaineous road, I looked around. The sun was rolling on its bed, peeling its\
  \ last layer of sleep as the moon bid goodnight to us. The air had a familiar aroma,\
  \ fresh pines and musk.\n\nWe reached our hotel that was on the extreme end of the\
  \ mall road. \n\nAfter gorging on aloo paratha, bread omelette and ginger chai,\
  \ we left our hotel room to walk around. \n\nWe strolled and shopped from local\
  \ stores and walked uphill towards Dharamkot, a village with a beautiful view of\
  \ the snow-capped mountain range called Triund, on the outskirts of Mcleodganj.\
  \ \n\nHuffing and puffing we reached Dharamkot. There were two shops and a taxi\
  \ stand. The first shop was selling fruits and the second one snacks and tea. I\
  \ ordered three cardomom teas and we enjoyed the view outside. \n\nWe spent that\
  \ day walking around the village, talking to the locals and eating a home-cooked\
  \ meal at their insistence. Later in the evening a few of the villagers took us\
  \ to a temple in time to see the evening aarti.\n\nThe next day we booked a cab\
  \ for the sole purpose of sight seeing. We visited Kangra fort, the sunset point\
  \ (which was a terrible idea given that the sun was completely hidden behind a curtain\
  \ of black clouds) and St. John Wilderness church. \n\nI still vividly remember\
  \ the church because it was after dusk. The driver had stopped the car in the middle\
  \ of nowhere and there wasn't a soul save ours. I could hear crickets chirping and\
  \ the moonlight shining through the clouded sky. As we pushed open the metallic\
  \ gate and had reached halfway, Jyoti whispered to us -'Look towards your right'\
  \ and my heart skipped a beat. We were inches away from a graveyard. The three of\
  \ us screamed in unison and ran back to our cab. It wasn't until we were inside\
  \ the car did we look at each other and start laughing. \n\nThe next day, I woke\
  \ up early and went for a walk by myself.  After a few steps, I noticed a quaint\
  \ tea shop with a steel roof painted sky blue. There was a middle-aged man brewing\
  \ all sorts of tea. I pulled up a red plastic chair kept in front of the shop and\
  \ ordered ginger chai. I looked at people walking by or sitting there reading the\
  \ newspaper. I never knew then,  that my mind would photograph this moment for a\
  \ lifetime. \n\nAs I wandered down the street towards the Temple road, I saw a Tibetan\
  \ monastery. There were monks and a few tourists walking past me. I followed them\
  \ and after climbing a flight of stairs, I reached the temple and removed my shoes\
  \ before entering the monastery. \n\nIt was quiet inside. I walked on the wooden\
  \ floor and looked at the huge stupa of Lord Buddha. I moved towards the statue\
  \ and stood there with my eyes closed and head bowed. \n\nAnd then I began to weep.\
  \ They weren't tears of long rooted sadness or a sudden of bolt of happiness. They\
  \ were just tears, perhaps tears of epiphany. \n\nI left the monastery after spinning\
  \ the prayer wheels and climbed back to my hotel. \n\nIt isn't that, that moment\
  \ changed my life drastically but it did push open a closed door. Behind that door\
  \ is a room that smells damp and is covered in cobwebs and dust. And I am standing\
  \ at the threshold of this room with a vacuum cleaner and a duster in my hand, hoping\
  \ to find the source of my involuntary tears, spiritual growth and enlightenment\
  \ somewhere in this mess."
