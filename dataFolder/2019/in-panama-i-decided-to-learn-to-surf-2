Text: "In Panama I decided to learn to surf. \n\nI bought my first surfboard and started\
  \ a routine of walking to the beach every morning. I remembered the tips my friends\
  \ had given me the few times I had borrowed one of their big foamy boards, and I\
  \ made my way through the waves. I fell. Then I fell again and again. I was awkward\
  \ and wobbly; it seemed impossible to stand on my new board. After days of this,\
  \ I finally managed to stand for a few shaky seconds riding on the foamy white water\
  \ of a broken wave. I went home triumphant and a little sunburned. \n\nI started\
  \ to recognize people on the beach and a friend of a friend stopped to help me.\
  \ He pushed me into a few waves and then paddled out to join his brothers. I marveled\
  \ at how effortlessly he and his brothers dropped in and surfed on the face of waves.\
  \  \nI continued like this for the months I spent in panama\u2014walking to the\
  \ beach with my board under my arm, spending hours practicing, and emerging happy\
  \ but with a water filled nose. My new friend stopped to help me often and soon\
  \ his brothers and friends did too. I was having a beer one night in the hostel\
  \ talking to one of these friends and he commented on how much my surfing was improving.\
  \ We joked about how long it had taken me to figure out how to stand and about disciplined\
  \ I was. He gave me some pointers and from then on, we were friends too. \nThis\
  \ group of surfer boys became my community. I would go out drinking with them and\
  \ listen to them talk about lefts, rights, and tubes. Things I did not understand\
  \ or really care about, but around which their lives revolved. At times, I would\
  \ try to ask them about school or I would mention a movie from my childhood, but\
  \ they would shrug off these questions and become quiet. I quickly realized that\
  \ on these things we could not relate. Growing up in a very small, isolated town\
  \ in Panama my friends had vastly different experiences than I had growing up in\
  \ a San Francisco suburb. Sometimes the distance this created was too great. \n\n\
  I would see them every day I went to the beach. I spent lazy hours with them floating\
  \ on my board waiting for waves. They politely went around me when I fell or failed\
  \ to get out of their way. Gradually, I improved. Paddling became easier, I could\
  \ finally sit stably on my board, and when I managed to stand up, I felt in control.\
  \ The first time I ever caught an unbroken wave I was shocked. It was a completely\
  \ different feeling and it was thrilling being in front of the white water. Still,\
  \ I could never quite muster the courage to drop into bigger waves. I always bailed\
  \ at the last second or I waited too long and stood when I was already in the white\
  \ water. \n\nEventually it was time for me to leave Panama. I sold my board and\
  \ said goodbye to my new friends. They told me to call them when I was ready to\
  \ come back, but that I better learn to surf first. There were no excuses for someone\
  \ from California not to learn. \nFrom Panama I went to Colombia. I spent ten days\
  \ on the Pacific coast and rented a surf board. The first day I met a tall Colombian\
  \ with dreadlocks and the next day I met his friend. They started giving me tips\
  \ about surfing and making fun of me for being too afraid to drop into waves. I\
  \ smiled, and asked them about lefts and rights."
