Text: "A tall green cross erected before San Juan Chamula Church. Just like any other\
  \ Christian crosses, it had four arms. Nothing exceptional. But upon closer examination,\
  \ you would see petal-shaped symbols carved on each arm. Later, I found out that\
  \ the cross symbolised a ceiba tree, native to North and South America, known as\
  \ the tree of life. Was the cross I know of not the cross of cruxifixction?\n\n\
  I stood at the entrance of the church, a bit unsettled to walk in. The stern-looking\
  \ men by the door, in their wool tunics, cast eerie glances at me when I held out\
  \ my phone to take pictures. At first, I thought it was due to my foreign looks.\
  \ In my yoga pants, I did seem out of place. It turned out that pictures were strictly\
  \ prohibited inside the church, acceptable on the exterior. The punishment for breaching\
  \ was severe. So I carefully put away my phone and entered. \n\nThere was no sunlight\
  \ streaming into the church, only row and rows of flaming candles bordering it.\
  \ The floor was laden with pine-needle. And the muffled voices. Men, women, children\
  \ were praying to the Saints, some unrecognizable, though the fiesta of San Juan\
  \ was over. The Chamulas were very private people; I could feel tension radiating\
  \ from them towards non-locals. You mind your business and they mind their own.\
  \ It made sense because as seen historically, the Mayans fought for independence\
  \ against the Spanish. Catholicism did infiltrate indigenous religion, but indigenous\
  \ influence was still predominant in Chamula. Outsiders were simply not welcomed.\
  \ \n\nOver the course of 19 years, I have moved around churches and beliefs. I was\
  \ baptised at the age of six at a local catholic church. Then I was sent to a Christian\
  \ school, later an Anglican. I have never been consistent with attending or worshipping\
  \ at one particular church. On top of that, science and evidence-based learning\
  \ often sow doubts in my faith. Sometimes my faith is weary. Sometimes my faith\
  \ is strong.\n\nIn a world of robotics and machines, Chamulas pick their Gods of\
  \ celestial bodies. They believe in the Sun God for protection and healing. They\
  \ believe in what others see as obsolete. They fight and resist to preserve traditions\
  \ rightfully theirs \u2014 if there were any left. The candlelights at the church\
  \ were flaming, but the faith and determination of Chamulas was blinding."
