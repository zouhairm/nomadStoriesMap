Text: "Saturday October 21, I said goodbye to my family and best friends. This would\
  \ be the last time I would see them until I come home, or they come visit me. Saying\
  \ goodbye to my mom in the airport was the hardest thing to do. Not only was I actually\
  \ leaving her, but it would be hard to keep in touch due to the time difference\
  \ (a whooping 11 hours and now with the time difference, 12). Just being in Boston,\
  \ I could come home whenever I wanted, now I am completely on my own. The plane\
  \ ride over was okay. It left early Sunday morning and I was privileged to sit next\
  \ to a guy that not only didn't speak English, but also did not understand personal\
  \ space. After pushing his feet off my body (multiple times) and creating a barrier\
  \ with my pillow, I was able to sleep for most of the 15 hour ride to Hong Kong.\
  \ However, I missed a meal, which left me hungry and a little cranky when I woke\
  \ up at 10 in the morning \_Boston time, but 10 at night China time. During my time\
  \ awake on the plane, I tried to watch the Patriots game (to no avail, and I'm still\
  \ a little upset about it) and discovered that the plane took me OVER THE WORLD.\
  \ I assumed when I got on the flight, that I would be going across the United States,\
  \ over to China. Nope, I went over Greenland, and the Arctic Circle, into Russia\
  \ and then into China. Who would've thought that was even an option. Upon my arrival,\
  \ 25 hours after I had left home, I was greeted by the abundance of luggage I had\
  \ taken. Two suitcases, a duffle, my backpack and my tote. All of which, cost me\
  \ an extra $200, and some very sore arms. I officially had no clue where I was.\
  \ After finding my driver, and arriving to the hotel, I spent the next two days\
  \ inside my hotel room, since I was too afraid to explore the city by myself. I\
  \ had never traveled alone before, and all the fears of being kidnapped swirled\
  \ through my head, I was not taking the risk. Wednesday morning, I woke up at 8\
  \ and walked myself down to the lobby. This was the first time I'd been out of my\
  \ hotel room, and the first time I would interact with people from Media Kids. I\
  \ was greeted by a small group of people, who like me, needed to go to the police\
  \ station and get their criminal background checks. The first person I spoke to\
  \ just so happened to be from Boston, and went to school at Simmons, right next\
  \ to Wheelock. Together, the small group we were in traveled to the police station,\
  \ taking the Sky Train and sorted ourselves out. My first real meal in Thailand\
  \ wasn't even a real meal, since it was just chunks of watermelon. After our adventure\
  \ through the city, it was time to check out of my room, and into the room Media\
  \ Kids got me. I got my luggage, and looked at everything everyone else had brought,\
  \ and of course, I had the most stuff. I received my new room, a new SIMS card and\
  \ phone number and walked myself and my whole life into a new room, where I accidentally\
  \ woke up my roommate. I apologized and made my way over to Sienna's room and found\
  \ out her roommate happened to also be from Boston, and went to Emmanuel. Finding\
  \ people that were from Boston and knew the same things that I knew, and even were\
  \ living in the same area as me was a relief. I had actually made friends, and we\
  \ actually had stuff we could talk about, it was like getting a little piece of\
  \ home. Traveling alone for the first time is a scary thing, and the fact that I\
  \ would be living in Thailand for six months by myself was even scarier. Six months\
  \ is a long time, but for the next six months, Thailand was my home."
