Text: "My grandma, a small-framed woman, with high cheekbones, sporting a blow-dried\
  \ pixie hair cut and never fails to dye it black. She's the typical Chinese grandma,\
  \  albeit being a tad superstitious, she will feed you with lots of home cook meals\
  \ and showered you with love. When my grandpa passed away, aside from going to Singapore\
  \ to do medical check-ups, she always refuses when asked to go on a family vacation.\
  \ So when out of the blue she gives us the idea about going to Seoul, we agreed\
  \ without hesitation. You can call it an impromptu trip as we bought the tickets\
  \ only a couple months before and my grandma actually is still recovering from knee\
  \ surgery.\n\nThe day finally came, it was early March 2018, when the weather was\
  \ still transitioning;  a bit warm for Winter yet too early to be called it Spring,\
  \ as the cool breeze can still be felt brushing through us. That was the first time\
  \ we ever stepped foot at Seoul. We've all looked forward to this trip, not only\
  \ this is our first trip together with my grandma ever since our grandpa's passing,\
  \ it is tough for us to find a schedule that works.\n\nWe had a red-eye flight and\
  \ arrived there in the morning, so once we reached our hotel, we took it easy for\
  \ the day. Fortunately, we stayed around Myeongdong area, the tourist melting pot,\
  \ it has lots of shops and street food alike. The following day, we've decided to\
  \ do breakfast the Korean way, eating cup ramen at 7-eleven, while we're busy deciding\
  \ which ramen to pick, an ajumma (which literally translates to \"aunt\") came over\
  \ and asked us where we're from in Indonesian language, since she overheard us talking\
  \ in Indonesian. After helping us to pick the best ramen to try, she told us that\
  \ she used to live in Jakarta with her husband from the eighties to the late nineties,\
  \ that's why she's able to speak Indonesian. After we're done, she offered to guide\
  \ us to nearby Namdaemun Market and showed us all the hidden gems. Afterward, she\
  \ suggested showing us around Dongdaemun area. Unfortunately, we've booked Nanta\
  \ show that evening, since the ajumma doesn't use a smartphone, we decided to meet\
  \ up the next day around 2 p.m in front of a police station.\n\nAfter the meeting\
  \ that day my grandma was ecstatic to meet someone her age, even though they don't\
  \ converse much, it showed on her face. The next day, right on time, we saw the\
  \ ajumma standing, or as she preferred to be called halmeonni, which means grandma\
  \ in Korean. First stop, she brought us to see the Dongdaemun Design Plaza design\
  \ by the famous  Zaha Hadid, then we moved to the youthful Hongdae area, where we\
  \ stroll around nearby shops that sells varieties of clothes and trinkets. Lunchtime,\
  \ the halmeonni brought us to the infamous Gwangjang Market, where you can find\
  \ a lot of traditional Korean dishes and street food, we stopped by at this small\
  \ restaurant she frequents, and she ordered us lots of foods one of them is yukhoe\
  \ was also known as Korean style beef tartare, at first we're unsure about the dish,\
  \ but after being convinced we managed to try it, surprisingly it doesn't smell,\
  \ even my grandma who's picky when it comes to trying foreign food, loved it. To\
  \ complete the meal; halmeonni ordered us Makgeolli, a light sparkling Korean rice\
  \ wine, the taste of it refreshes us. \n\nFull from all the foods and makgeolli\
  \ we took a stroll alongside the Cheonggyecheon river, it is a public recreation\
  \ place which stretches for approximately 10-11 kilometers long. Did I mentioned,\
  \ throughout the whole day my grandma walks instead of riding the wheelchair as\
  \ she planned before the trip because halmeonni encourages her to walk and trained\
  \ her knee so that she'll gain strength. As the sun sets, we have to part ways to\
  \ halmeonni, she promises that when she goes to Jakarta she'll ring us. For the\
  \ rest of the trip, my grandma is elated, not only she enjoyed it, but she's also\
  \ glad she made new friends, tried new foods and made local connections along the\
  \ way."
