Text: "Torrential rain and a barrage of mosquitos assaulted our descent from Mount.com.\
  \ Thong-clad feet skated down the muddy slope towards ground level, fighting for\
  \ traction, covered in grime.\n\nMobile clutched in one hand, an inadequate umbrella\
  \ in the other, I giggled at the foolishness of our plight for reception. Our quests\
  \ for contact up self-dubbed Mount.com were getting out of hand. We had become the\
  \ 'silly kaivalagi' trying to bushwalk in the middle of an introduction to the Fijian\
  \ wet season.\n\nLei (my homestay mum) cackled with glee as I stood dripping on\
  \ the doorstep beside my friend Keely. She threw her head back, teeth glowing, mouth\
  \ wide, hands on hips, as she expressed her amusement. The laugh of a Fijian is\
  \ like a drink of hot tea, it catches you by surprise and then wraps you in its\
  \ warmth, sliding all the way down into your belly until you're chuckling too. We\
  \ laughed through dinner, through cards, through impromptu language lessons, and\
  \ eventually off to bed.\n\nThis was the habitual routine of our evenings spent\
  \ in the village of Nakavu.\n\n...\n\nThe next day I found myself being escorted,\
  \ somewhat tentatively, up Mount.com again. This time not by my fellow kaivalagi,\
  \ but by two fourteen year old Fijian boys.\n\nI was off to have 'tea with a grandma',\
  \ an item which had been sitting on my personal bucket list since I first spied\
  \ the grace-filled valleys lining the faces of Fiji's older generation. They held\
  \ the promise of a cultural authenticity that is now rare, dying due to the influence\
  \ of mobiles and music videos.\n\nI found my opportunity on the fifteenth of July\
  \ at 10am, during Nakavu's Sunday church service. Perched on an unforgiving wooden\
  \ pew, engraved with foreign words, crammed with well-worn hymn books and well-dressed\
  \ locals, I had the privilege of meeting Marianna. Her smile lines, gentle voice\
  \ and wise demeanour stole my heart instantly. Fearlessly, she began to share her\
  \ life, confessing the sorrow of sending her son off to the army, her faith in the\
  \ Lord that could move mountains, and then of her husband and village life.\n\n\
  By the close of our conversation, Marianna had invited me for tea at her house,\
  \ atop Mount.com. I had my date with a grandma.\n\nHence, why I was again scrambling\
  \ up the slick slope, wondering how on earth the seventy year old Marianna managed\
  \ to reach her house every day. My two young escorts, Siti and Losi, were off ahead\
  \ shooting each other with homemade sling shots, flashing pearly whites back at\
  \ me and pointing out trip points in the track until we arrived.\n\nMarianna's home\
  \ was a humble oasis of flowering green, embracing a simple fibro shack. I was bustled\
  \ through its door and out of the merciless sun, finding myself in an airless lounge\
  \ room of rugs and cheap fur, otherwise known as an oven. It seemed that an extensive\
  \ bake-off had occurred over the morning, leaving the house an odorous hotbox of\
  \ sweetness and sweat. There was no breeze, and no space, but in true Fijian style,\
  \ a vast array of carb-heavy baba kau, cake and smiling faces.\n\nI had never felt\
  \ so immediately at home. We talked for hours, listening and laughing. Curious cousins,\
  \ friends and family walking barefoot in and out of the building, all unconsciously\
  \ working to create an environment of openness so unlike Australian society. We\
  \ need generosity, and genuine love.\n\nMarianna left me with beautiful beads as\
  \ a gift, her home address to write, and advice to ponder. She called me her daughter,\
  \ and I found I had adopted another Lei.\n\nDescending Mount.com in the sunshine\
  \ this time, I felt full to bursting - local Fiji was now another love of mine.\n\
  \nAtop that mountain, reception was disappointingly scarce, but these three local\
  \ truths resided in abundance:\n\n- \"Come for tea\" actually means, \"A feast is\
  \ being prepared do not eat for three days prior.\"\n- The most useful phrase in\
  \ Fijian is, \"Au sa ma mau\", meaning \"I am very\_very\_full\".\n- If you are\
  \ expecting to dine with a single individual, you will always meet with at least\
  \ three extra people. Potentially relatives, but just as likely to be strangers."
