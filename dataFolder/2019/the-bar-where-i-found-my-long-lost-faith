Text: "There were nine of us in this narrow alleyway in Prague, looking for our destination\
  \ in those streets that none of us knew, making our way to a highly recommended\
  \ bar in downtown. As we went through those narrow streets, I marvelled at the beauty\
  \ of eastern European architecture that shined in every building in this unusual\
  \ neighbourhood. I also wondered absent-mindedly about this group of people surrounding\
  \ me, whom I originally met four days earlier in a summer school we were all attending.\n\
  \nI had left Egypt heavyhearted, as one of my dear friends was recently imprisoned\
  \ under false accusations for being a political satirist, so I travelled hoping\
  \ to find some peace of mind or to at least escape my reality for just a couple\
  \ of weeks. When I read the tourists\u2019 guide, one particular bar caught my attention;\
  \ it was themed after the movie V for Vendetta, which was one of my imprisoned friend\u2019\
  s favourite movies and he was the one that recommended the movie to me in the first\
  \ place. When I read about this bar, I suddenly felt the urge to go this place,\
  \ take pictures in hope that he could see them one day when he is free and in an\
  \ attempt to feel his presence even if he is thousands of miles away. \n\nMy thoughts\
  \ were interrupted by my friend\u2019s voice, saying that we finally reached our\
  \ destination. The bar was inside a really old building which had a huge wooden\
  \ gate in front of it, that opens to an empty space with a couple of small fountains,\
  \ after which there is a brown side door that didn\u2019t have any signs on it;\
  \ this was the door to the strangest bar I\u2019ve ever been to. On the inside,\
  \ the staff were wearing the movie\u2019s famous mask as they served the drinks,\
  \ and the walls had several paintings from the movie, some of which were quotes\
  \ from the most well-known scenes. Even the menu had some specials that were written\
  \ in secret ink, those can only be seen when the waiter brings this blue flashlight.\
  \ \n\nWe sat around a table by the window, some of them were talking and laughing\
  \ but I wasn\u2019t paying attention; I was physically in Prague but my thoughts\
  \ were back in Cairo. I zoned out, lost in my thoughts, trying to find one good\
  \ reason why my friend was back in prison and not with me having drinks in this\
  \ artistic place that I knew he would love.\n\nIn the past few days, I had gotten\
  \ really close to four of the 8 people around this table, and despite the fact that\
  \ they all come from very different backgrounds than mine and have never been in\
  \ my shoes; they understood. As I sat there silently staring at the walls, one of\
  \ them slowly came and sat next to me; then he held my hand and asked if I was okay;\
  \ I only smiled and nodded so he smiled back and kept holding my hand. A few moments\
  \ later, the waiter came with our drinks, to my surprise one of the girls who weren\u2019\
  t close to me, decided to make a toast. She said \u201Cwe know that there is nothing\
  \ we can do to help and we cannot even imagine how hard it is for you, but we are\
  \ here for you! Here is to you and your friend, may you see him soon.\u201D We all\
  \ raised our glasses and drank to that, I couldn\u2019t stop smiling but I was completely\
  \ out of words. \n\nOn our way back to the hotel, I couldn\u2019t help but reflect\
  \ on what happened that night, as we walked through the ancient streets of Prague.\
  \ These people just met me and none of them had anything to prove, but they still\
  \ decided to follow me to an old bar in downtown, just to help me feel better about\
  \ a personal issue related to someone they never even heard about. I felt so overwhelmed\
  \ by the gesture, I originally came to this city hoping to catch my breath & find\
  \ some temporary joy; instead I found what I least expected: my long lost faith\
  \ in humanity."
