Text: "Every now and then, if you're lucky, you experience a moment so surreal that\
  \ you never want to live your life the same way after. \n\n---\n\nI got off the\
  \ bus at a dingy little shack that bordered the edge of New York and Vermont. It\
  \ was hidden in the shadows of a group of trees that appeared abnormally tall for\
  \ the East Coast. It was the furthest a public bus would take me from New York,\
  \ and it was the most I could do if I wanted to travel to Vermont with nothing but\
  \ public transportation and my school's bus card. I entered the shack in hopes of\
  \ a map and a cup of coffee, but was slammed by the contrasting smells of cinnamon,\
  \ mint, and tobacco instead. The walls were covered in photos of men and women hunting\
  \ and above the counter, sat the head of a deer with eyes so empty and lifeless,\
  \ it seemed as if it knew just how anxious I really was. As I walked towards the\
  \ lady sitting behind the store's counter, I nervously glanced at the people sitting\
  \ around the shack. An elderly couple played chess in one corner while a few middle-aged\
  \ men watched a football game on a TV on the wall. I'd seen too many movies of people\
  \ being kidnapped and murdered in little roadside stores like this to feel calm,\
  \ but I had already come so far, I couldn't bear the thought of turning back. I\
  \ bought a cup of the sweetest Hazelnut coffee I'd ever tasted, and luckily, the\
  \ lady had a map of the local streets in Vermont. I was off to explore wherever\
  \ the map would take me.\n\n---\n\nAfter leaving the shack, I walked for an hour\
  \ North. At my fifth mile, I noticed a small cafe with brick walls and \"Vermont\"\
  \ painted in graffiti on the front window. As I sat down for a cup of sweet tea\
  \ and a platter of french toast, I listened overhead to a slowed down, acoustic\
  \ cover of Journey's \"Don't Stop Believing.\" This was the most spontaneous decision\
  \ I ever made and I could not believe that I was alone, sitting in a cafe in Vermont,\
  \ with no idea where I was going next. \n\nIn fact, I realized, this was the first\
  \ time in my life I was truly alone. My family, friends, neighbors, no one familiar\
  \ was around. It was just me in a strange land with people I'd never met. The most\
  \ familiar thing at the moment was the french toast on my plate. \n\nAlthough everything\
  \ was new and strange, I was now calm. For the time I spent sitting in that cafe,\
  \ I felt like I was watching my own life playing in an empty theater screen. Every\
  \ second seemed cinematic; surreal even.\n\n---\n\nThe day was slowly coming to\
  \ an end when I reached a bus stop I had planned to take to my hotel prior to the\
  \ trip. It was dark and once again, I felt a tug of anxiety in my stomach as I boarded\
  \ the bus. If something were to happen to me, no one would know for a while. However,\
  \ as I watched the sun slowly sink against the woods next to the road, I realized\
  \ my first day alone, my first trip entirely solo, was a success. I had plenty of\
  \ coffee and I was still alive. \n\nWhen I reached the hotel, I grabbed my final\
  \ cup of coffee of the day. Although I was exhausted from being spontaneous the\
  \ entire day, I laid awake reliving the moment I spent in the cafe. The surreal\
  \ feeling of being completely alone and confident in my spontaneity as \"Don't Stop\
  \ Believing\" played in the background, left me hopeful for more adventures rooted\
  \ in living in a way such that I could look back in retrospect and see my life as\
  \ a cinematic. \n\nAnd in the end, with every step I take, I'd always have coffee\
  \ to come back to. That's all that really mattered."
