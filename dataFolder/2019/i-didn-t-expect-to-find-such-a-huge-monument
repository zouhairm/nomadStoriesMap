Text: "In my today\u2019s story I shall describe what I didn\u2019t expect to find\
  \ in a Russian city. I mean a monument, a huge monument to a mother. It is called\
  \ Mother Protectress or \u201CAnne\u201D. \nIt is one of the landmarks of the city\
  \ of Cheboksary (Chuvash Republic, Russia), a symbol of the city and the republic\
  \ as a whole, as well as a symbol of the revival of the local (Chuvash) people.\
  \ \nFirst of all, it is situated in the historic part, on the ancient hill, adjacent\
  \ to the western waterfront of the Bay. It really resemles the statue of Christ\
  \ the Redeemer in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil! \n\nMother Protectress\nIs incredible,\n\
  At the same time -\nUnbelievable.\n\nThe size of the monument exceeds all created\
  \ before in Chuvashia monuments: it is 151 ft high. At the bottom of the basement\
  \ one can read: \u201CBlessed are my children, living in peace and love.\u201D\n\
  \nMother Protectress\ndefends her children,\nteenagers,  adults -\nevery citizen.\n\
  \nThe monument project was developed on the idea and concept of the first president\
  \ of Chuvashia. There was established a charitable foundation for its construction.\
  \ When the monument was at last opened in 2003, it has become a subject of controversy,\
  \ drawing criticism from those who objected on various (and not only artistic) grounds\u2026"
