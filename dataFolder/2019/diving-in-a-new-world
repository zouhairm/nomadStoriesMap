Text: I remember my first day as a volunteer in Salta in northern Argentina, I was
  assigned to hold lectures on human rights and I was also in charge of publicizing
  the space. On the way to my first day of work, my mind whipped and went mad as I
  planned the perfect way to perform in a supposedly majestic work environment, followed
  by extremely noble and essential tasks. Kari was the owner of the foundation and
  responsible for introducing me to the foundation, as well as guided me in my work
  routine, I was waiting for her in a small square near a crowded avenue full of people
  (mostly tourists) and handicraft fairs it was very sunny and the trees in the place
  did not stop the damp heat from penetrating my skin, I could not avoid the beads
  of sweat running down my brow to the tips of my eyebrows, I wiped them immediately,
  I did not want to perspire , I wore a light blue social shirt, dark jeans, and white
  tennis shoes, not very formal, but I also avoiding a casual outfit, after all I
  had to be dressed according to the expected situation. I had arrived thirty minutes
  before the scheduled time, so I had enough time to wonder about my first day as
  a global volunteer in that new country. The white corridors and air-conditioned
  rooms filled with large glass tables, meetings of how we would discuss and disseminate
  in a conservative city such an urgent, necessary and sensitive subject as that of
  human rights. Those images kept breaking into my mind. All these expectations excited
  me at the same time that they pressed me with the magnitude of this new challenge.
