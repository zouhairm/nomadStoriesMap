Text: "Seconds since I\u2019d set foot on Giza bus stop and I had already been tossed\
  \ around like an open book. Moments later, I burst headlong in the dazzling city\
  \ lights whilst grip once this place, I\u2019d found myself lodged grudgingly between\
  \ unfamiliar faces on a microbus bound for the Giza stop. I looked at my watch.\
  \ My first assignment in a foreign country and was already running late.\n\nAlshima\
  \ was waiting for me at the bus stop. She held me in an irascible glance as her\
  \ hijab wrapped visage took down my timid features in unforgiving dollops.\n\"Someone's\
  \ early.\"\n\"I'm sorry.\u201D\nI responded with a curt nod.\n\"I'll be working\
  \ as your translator. We must hurry up. Shall we?\"\nAnother curt nod followed.\
  \ I short walk brought me to my client. While he shot questions at me in fluent\
  \ Arabic, I responded to his queries in English, she is acting as the straight-faced\
  \ conduit between us. Our interpreter of maladies. It was a very formal conversation.\
  \ Nothing outlandish. But something about it seemed to pique Altima's curiosity\
  \ a great deal. I could sense that by the sly smile her lips erupted into occasionally,\
  \ upon some of my answers.\nAt Least I wouldn't have to deal in curt nods anymore.\n\
  Our next stop was Tahrir square. Once hailed, the ride frittered away mostly among\
  \ half exchanged glances and syllables. And of course, and more curt nods.\nTahrir\
  \ square, the cradle of the Egyptian revolution, the place had a breeze of sentient\
  \ rebellion scattered briefly around it. Something about the place livened up Alshima\
  \ as well. Seemed to be a sense of deep-rooted bonhomie, cultured over time.\nThe\
  \ next bus was an hour's time away.\nWe sat there to hide the time away.\n\"So,\
  \ are you from around here?\"\nSurprisingly she seemed to loosen up. I hadn't misread\
  \ into those sly smiles after all.\n\"No. From Saudi Arabia.\"\n\"That's interesting.\"\
  \nA delicate sneer groped her face.\n\"Quite the contrary actually. You wouldn't\
  \ want to be locked up in your room almost every day would you?\"\nI was back to\
  \ curt nods again.\n\"It's alright. It's how life it is out there. We're not expected\
  \ to attend school, neither leave our homes and long garbs at any instant of time.\"\
  \n\"You grow used to it. Resigning to your fate is easier than it sounds.\nFortunately\
  \ enough, my father allowed me to pursue my passion\"\nWith that particular confession,\
  \ she seemed particularly good natured about me. It was as if she hadn't been heard\
  \ in a very long time. And me lending ears was proving itself to be a catharsis\
  \ for her.\nHer vitality and frankness had already struck a chord with me. I craved\
  \ for more.\nSuddenly she inched closer for divulging a secret.\n\"What do you think\
  \ about tattoos?\"\n\"I'm not a big fan, to say the least.\"\nShe seemed ashen for\
  \ a moment. Then she collected herself and resumed speaking.\n\"They're considered\
  \ to be Haram in Islam. It counts as tampering with your own skin, and hence indirectly\
  \ with God's perfect creation.\"\n\"That's pretty convenient on their part.\"\n\"\
  I like the idea of them. It represents a journey that you're a part of.\"\nI was\
  \ regarding her with deep interest now, narrowly coupled with a tiny twinge of embarrassment\
  \ too. I could see why my previous statement had put her out of place a bit. And\
  \ yet she had managed to shake it off so effortlessly, and establish her conviction\
  \ nonetheless.\nShe was seeking a reply. Sensing none, she went ahead.\n\"Let me\
  \ show you something.\"\nshe raised her right palm in her direction and politely\
  \ curled up all of her fingers into a fist, saved the index one so that it remained\
  \ jutted out quite insolently.\nthere was inscribed something\n\"I got this done\
  \ first thing overreaching here. The needle does hurt a bit as I had rightly heard.\"\
  \nA sheepish smile coyly landed on her face.\n\"What is that script?\"\n\"It's Morse.\"\
  \n\"What does it say?\"\n\" \"Never give up.\" That's all my journey's been about.\"\
  \nThe words sank themselves with rustic diligence into my veins as in the distance,\
  \ Tahrir square seemed to have erupted into yet another revolution."
