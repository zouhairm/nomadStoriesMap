Text: "Do I follow my eyes, nose, ears or stomach?\n\nRainbow cornucopias of fresh\
  \ produce are dotted to my left, right and in Bordeaux's revered 'March\xE9 des\
  \ Capucins\u2019' entrance as though to welcome incomers, and entice them to enter.\
  \ Will each stall be identical? Perhaps not. Looking around, some stalls boast regional\
  \ specialties like mushrooms, and others state on their cardboard signs that their\
  \ crops are \u2018bio\u2019, meaning organic, or say they are directly from the\
  \ producer. Lucky I brought several shopping bags.\n\nForks and knives clink down\
  \ onto satisfyingly empty plates, waiters weaving their way through the limited\
  \ space between tables, and people waiting to be seated. I hope there are more caf\xE9\
  s.\n\n\u2018Merci\u2019, and \u2018bonne journ\xE9e\u2019 bounce through the market\
  \ with the coming and going of customers and venders alike with the frequent passing\
  \ of \u2018pardon\u2019, to navigate through the crowds.\n\nThe market\u2019s layout\
  \ is structured into distinguished aisled stalls, but simultaneously a labyrinth\
  \ that one can easily lose themselves in. Taking a panoramic glance, stalls have\
  \ similar layouts in the form of a square. \n\nCooked, baked or refrigerated goods\
  \ such as meats and cheeses, are showcased in glass cabinets, each with their own\
  \ touch. One had miniature wooden sheep covered in wool, positioned in the foreground\
  \ of mounds of cheese blocks; some untouched wheels and others segmented to show\
  \ what is in demand depending on size, but also to showcase their mould, cracks\
  \ and holes. Some cheese stalls stock cartons of eggs. A few are delis stocking\
  \ cured meats, some pre-packed and pre-sliced, marinated olives and vegetables one\
  \ could by the bucket, tinned fish, and also oils and vinegars. One replicated a\
  \ store; with an inner aisle to rather than to cueing outside, with wooden shelves\
  \ of jarred preserves. This particular deli had a wooden pig perched onto a large\
  \ can of olive oil.\n\nCrates and wicket baskets are packed with the season\u2019\
  s best, scales perched in the centre. Registers were tucked away, or vendors wore\
  \ belt bags. \n\nRoses, tulips, daisies, ranunculuses, gerberas of all colours and\
  \ tones, and those yet to bloom along with foliage are lined up in buckets, to be\
  \ bought individually or in arranged bouquets.\n\nGolden, flaky, puffy croissants\
  \ catch my eye; I have not had one since arriving, which has an essential for my\
  \ tasting ventures, as clich\xE9 as this one may be. Well, it is only 10.00, maybe\
  \ I should\u2026 some with chocolate peeking through their sides\u2026 On cue with\
  \ my sampling fantasies, my stomach growled. I should eat- something, yes. I have\
  \ only navigated a couple lefts and rights, there will be more nearby.\n\nPaper\
  \ bags rustle and I know that is a slicer whirring; I did work in an Australian\
  \ bakery after all. Languitoune boasted loaves and baguettes of varied shapes, sizes,\
  \ colours and textures. Flour is spattered against the glass where the price tags\
  \ are positioned with name, price and description. One loaf says \u2018Levain naturel\
  \ et fermentation longue\u2019. Look at those perfectly crafted cracks and crevices.\
  \ Natural fermentation; now this is my kind of bread. An airy but dense texture.\
  \ I can come back. \n\nAhead \u2018Mes souvenirs de L\u2019Espagne\u2019. Similar\
  \ to the store-like deli, instead with Spanish specialties. However, one can enjoy\
  \ those perched on a stool, at a table with wine. Bordeaux is on the cusp of the\
  \ Spanish border; it seems fitting there is a stall like this. \n\nTo its right,\
  \ people sit at a bar, steam wafting over their heads, cutting something. But what?\
  \ I venture over to discover two hot plates. Below the bar, containers of ingredients\
  \ like ham, cheese, Nutella, a sauce bottle to squeeze full of chocolate, chopped\
  \ onion. A look up at their blackboard confirms this is for cr\xEApes. Scanning\
  \ the menu, my all of my senses gravitate to \u2018Cr\xEApe chocolat maison\u2019\
  . I immediately search for my 4 \u20AC. After greeting and having general conversation,\
  \ the merchant asks if I would have it here, or away. I choose to take it with me,\
  \ so I can multi-task eating and looking. Once paying, and wishing her a \u2018\
  bonne journ\xE9e\u2019 I decide to walk straight, it is a wonder I do not have fingers\
  \ smothered with dark chocolate.\n\nNow around the next corner."
