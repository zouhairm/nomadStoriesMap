Text: "When I was still in middle school, I traveled abroad with my family across\
  \ all the major countries in Western Europe. When someone\u2019s on the road, the\
  \ scenery is nearly always the same. At first, I was occupied by the large cornfields\
  \ in the suburb of Germany. Feeling the gradual monotony of the landscape, however,\
  \ I tried to fix my eyes on a random spot outside the window, sometimes a tree and\
  \ sometimes a cow, watching it sliding back slowly until gradually out of sight;\
  \ then I would find a new spot to continue to rest my empty mind.\nThe boredom lasted\
  \ for hours until we reached the next station: Paris. My first impressions of the\
  \ city were just like anyone else: It was the city of light and romance, where the\
  \ real \u201Cmoveable feast\u201D began. Singers on the sidewalk, lovers beside\
  \ the Seine river, people reading books in the coffee shops, all under the dreamy\
  \ clouds tinted by the pink glow of sunset. From first glance, it was as fresh and\
  \ gorgeous as the first day of a maid\u2019s seventeen. \nBut where it all began\
  \ was the moment you stepped on its streets and received a more realistic impression\
  \ of life. The first day, I saw an old man with his guitar sitting on a wooden chair\
  \ beside the sidewalk, wearing a rough brown jacket, and playing a quite familiar\
  \ tune. Few people stopped to appreciate his performance, but I was attracted by\
  \ that unusual and remote disposition in him. Thus, walking slowly toward him, I\
  \ thought for a long while what to say; but eventually, I said nothing and just\
  \ gave him some money and a smile. When he gently thanked me, I suddenly found the\
  \ thing that had caught my attention: it was that secret sense of vicissitude wandering\
  \ in his deep-set eyes, filtering by the numberless days and nights spent alone\
  \ in the same place, and finally fading away slowly with the last beam of sunset.\n\
  The third day before we got on the road again, I strolled on the streets of Paris\
  \ for the last time. When I passed a bridge above the Seine, I saw a girl of about\
  \ ten sitting on a bench with her head lowered. Her left hand held a pink ballet\
  \ shoe with thick dirt on it. Somehow, I couldn\u2019t move my feet the moment I\
  \ saw her. Perhaps it was because I was in the dance group of my own school, or\
  \ perhaps it\u2019s only the sense of dismay on her that grasped my heart. Once\
  \ again, an unknown power forced me to go near her.\nShe raised her head and looked\
  \ at me with a set of beautiful blue eyes. At that time, I thought we both sensed\
  \ something unique, as if we\u2019re each other\u2019s long lost foreign sisters.\n\
  \u201CIs it about your shoes?\u201D I asked.\nHer body quivered for a second upon\
  \ hearing the word \u201Cshoes\u201D.\n\u201CI can\u2019t find the other one,\u201D\
  \ she answered in a low voice. \u201CI can\u2019t go home like this.\u201D\n\u201C\
  But it\u2019s your home anyway. Your mom won\u2019t blame you that hard.\u201D\n\
  She gave me a smile as warm as the day\u2019s sunshine, with that same pair of bright\
  \ ocean eyes.\nThat was the last significant encounter I had before leaving Paris.\n\
  \u201CDid you see the Eiffel Tower?\u201D One of my friends asked me when I came\
  \ home.\n\u201CYes, we went up on it and saw the whole night scene.\u201D\n\u201C\
  That must have been so romantic.\u201D\nPerhaps it is a romantic city, but after\
  \ all it\u2019s only a city. Many like to associate Paris with the dreamlike tune\
  \ of La Vie En Rose, but the one thing they forget is that roses have thorns, which\
  \ are just as beautiful as the petals."
