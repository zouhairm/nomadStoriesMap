Text: "Steep winding streets, residents sitting at the steps of their front doors,\
  \ small reddish or cream-coloured houses, sometimes with tiled fa\xE7ades \u2013\
  \ it all fits into the typical Lisbon. However, when I travelled there with my friends,\
  \ we did not expect such risk of robbery or what our accommodation\u2019s area would\
  \ look like. We knew we were staying in the Bel\xE9m district, known for the Bel\xE9\
  m Tower, the Jer\xF3nimos Monastery and the iconic pastry shop of local past\xE9\
  is de Bel\xE9m, but our accommodation belonged to another world at the edge of the\
  \ district. Painting was peeling off houses\u2019 dusty walls, cracks ran through\
  \ the tiles of fa\xE7ades, rust crept onto some window grills. There was a patina\
  \ of decay and calm abandon, but not abandonment, since the area still had its charm\
  \ and its residents who chatted in caf\xE9s around the corner. Though slightly run-down,\
  \ the area seemed peaceful.\n\nOn our first day exploring Lisbon, we had to return\
  \ to our accommodation so that one of my friends could change his shoes after stepping\
  \ on dog poop along the way. He left his trainers outside to keep the smell away\
  \ and clean them up later. I warned him not to leave stuff outside unattended, just\
  \ in case.\n\n\u201CWhy not? It\u2019s really quiet here,\u201D he insisted, too\
  \ confident about people\u2019s decency.\n\nWhen we were about to set off again,\
  \ through the window we saw a man in a tank top grab my friend\u2019s trainers and\
  \ dart away. My friend exclaimed that those were his favourite trainers, flung the\
  \ door open and ran to chase the thief. My other friend and me shrugged and followed.\
  \ The thief kept running towards the Ajuda district, despite the steep slopes. We\
  \ gradually lost sight of the Ajuda Palace above and the waterfront below as we\
  \ entered a remote area of small houses without tiled fa\xE7ades perched on slopes,\
  \ often with scaffolding, among walls of graffiti \u2013 it was the Lisbon not meant\
  \ for tourists. We kept running desperately. Eventually, the thief slipped away\
  \ into a corner and disappeared. Panting in what seemed the middle of nowhere, I\
  \ muttered:\n\n\u201CWell, our first day in Lisbon has been a disaster.\u201D\n\n\
  Annoyed and tired, we dragged ourselves up yet another slope in the summer-like\
  \ September heat and gasped \u2013 not just for breath, but because we had accidentally\
  \ discovered a breath-taking lookout, without any tourists. The river Tagus, the\
  \ 25th of April Bridge and part of the red-roofed city-centre stood out crystal-clear.\
  \ We gazed at the view, losing track of time, forgetting the day\u2019s embarrassing\
  \ adventure. Feeling the breeze again, we laughed away the Mission Impossible-like\
  \ chase of the thief \u2013 after all, some karma would come his way when he realised\
  \ that the stolen trainers were full of dog poop. Meanwhile, we were compensated\
  \ with the view.\n\nWe then headed towards the closest bar for much-needed coffee\
  \ and rest. When we were waiting to order, my friend complained that his family\
  \ would be angry at him for losing those expensive trainers. A Portuguese waiter\
  \ overheard and half-understood our conversation in Spanish. He asked us what happened\
  \ and my friend, who speaks Portuguese, explained briefly. After cursing the thief,\
  \ the sympathetic waiter then discreetly gave my friend his coffee for free, with\
  \ a wink.\n\nAs we sipped our coffees at a table outside, now at ease, we noticed\
  \ that the Ajuda Palace was back in view, closer to those dusty streets of graffiti\
  \ and cracked fa\xE7ades than we thought. The monumental palace coexisted with those\
  \ unvisited streets as unexpectedly as hospitality and thievery could coincide there."
