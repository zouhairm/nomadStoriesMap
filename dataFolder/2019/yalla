Text: "Every journey is a new beginning. The last time that I open my eyes I lived\
  \ an amazing experience.  In that opportunity the colours, perfumes, people in each\
  \ city, makes me realize that we are lucky. Because we lived in this world  and\
  \ we share our experiences, about culture and believes with brothers  and sisters\
  \ that we meet in the way to a new world. We are smiles, hugs, dance movements,\
  \ music, and off course greetings. My first time abroad was in Dubai.  I didn't\
  \ expect that I could live In that city. With any doubt my favourite place was the\
  \ old Dubai.  People from Pakistan, Turkey, India, Egypt in one place  is more than\
  \ perfect. Also, find spice, gold, cashemire, perfumes, Arabic coffee trade, allow\
  \ me enjoy, talk and improve my language with people around the world. \nI'm from\
  \ Colombia, can you imagine the cultural differences between Arabs and me?  It's\
  \ unbelievable but you learn day by day. For example the tradition around coffee\
  \ between us. My life in Colombia is coffee, since I have memory I drink it, now\
  \ imagine Arabic coffee and drink one cup with dates.  Is completely  different,\
  \ the smells, taste and the movement in your hand if you don't want more. Also,\
  \ I can't imagine someone  try to avoid drink one cup, for sure you will drink,\
  \ they convince you, isn't an option. If you are a big fan of coffee you can't stop\
  \ to talk about it with them. \nAnother important  topic is the religion,most part\
  \ of them are Muslim community. I consider myself as a open mind and I try to keep\
  \ with me the best of every culture. I learnt from them about the women as a treasure\
  \ and about their respect for each other, their family and, you know what? Their\
  \ traditions. I have a good friends from Egypt. They are amazing, and teach me all\
  \ about the music, Ramadan and celebrations. \n\nSomething that I really miss from\
  \ there is Al Fahidi neighborhood. Imagine a big place full of old houses, museums,\
  \ restaurants and coffee shops. Every time  that I was there,I found new places\
  \ with art, music and people that want to share with you their knowledge. \n\nAt\
  \ the end people remember my name, that I'm from Colombia and for sure I'm grateful\
  \ with every experience, the food that they share with me, the water, the landscapes,\
  \ sunsets and sunrise every day for six months. Yalla, it means come one! So...\
  \ you  understand me."
