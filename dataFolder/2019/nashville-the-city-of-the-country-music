Text: "One of the trips I loved more is the trio to Nashville. I always liked country\
  \ music, even if in Italy is not really popular, but when I arrived in America I\
  \ liked it even more, maybe because there was a radio station I loved or maybe because\
  \ someone who love country music was used to send me songs. Anyway, it happened\
  \ that me and other friends decided to go to visit another friend in Atlanta! When\
  \ we arrived our friend came to pick us up and we spent one night to her house.\
  \ The day after we woke up early and we rented a car. We drove from Atlanta to Nashville\
  \ which is only 250 miles, so it took us only 4 hours driving, and it is not a lot\
  \ if you travel in America. We didn\u2019t sleep much the night before, so we took\
  \ turns, a bit for sleeping but also to enjoy the landscape outside. We booked a\
  \ motel a bit far from Nashville because the hotels downtown were too expensive,\
  \ and we didn\u2019t want to spend much, in any case we had a car to travel around\
  \ and an uber to go out at night.\n\nUnfortunately, we stayed there only for a weekend\
  \ because all of us had to go back to work on Monday, but it was enough to have\
  \ fun and discover a bit the city. Downtown Nashville is so peculiar, there are\
  \ lots of pubs, restaurants, bars and shops to buy local staff like hats or boots.\
  \ The first day we walked around in the city and we stopped in a pub to have lunch,\
  \ I ordered chicken fingers which is one of the speciality of Nashville and I really\
  \ love to eat local food. The best thing of Nashville and bars is that there is\
  \ live music 24hours and it is amazing because you might also listen to someone\
  \ who maybe will be famous in the future. Walking around we met two guys from Nashville\
  \ and they decided to take us for a tour. It is always lovely to meet local people\
  \ because they can explain things to you that no book or guide actually can. \n\n\
  We try to spend as less as we could because none of us was rich but at the same\
  \ time we wanted to live fully Nashville. We did a whiskey experience, and we visited\
  \ a distillery and there are lots of distilleries in Nashville so if you are a fan\
  \ of whiskey, you absolutely need a tour of the distilleries there, so you can try\
  \ Jack Daniel\u2019s exactly in the place where it comes from. After, the guys took\
  \ us to see where all the record companies are, and in the meantime, they were telling\
  \ us some stories about famous country singer and showing us the apartments or the\
  \ houses where they live sometimes.\nI wanted to see the Country Music Hall of Fame\
  \ and Museum and the Jhonny cash museum, but we didn\u2019t have time. Those are\
  \ on my bucket list for the next time I will be in Nashville because I am pretty\
  \ sure I will be there again.\n\nAt night, the best place to be is downtown where\
  \ all the pubs are, called the Broadway, it is the main street where you can find\
  \ bars and pubs like Legends corner, the Stage, Honky Tonk Central and many more.\
  \ We went at the Honky Tonk which is a three-level bar of live music, with lot of\
  \ space to dance. After we moved in another bar which I don\u2019t remember the\
  \ name but since we didn\u2019t like the music, too lounge, it was killing our spirit\
  \ of party, we moved in a famous bar, the Coyote Ugly saloon famous for the movie,\
  \ the bartop dancing and the body-shot. We decided to spend the rest of the night\
  \ here since we were having such a good time. \nThe day after we went to the John\
  \ Seigenthaler Pedestrian Bridge which gives you an outstanding view of the Nashville\
  \ skyline, we took some pictures at Nashville WhatLiftsYou Wings Mural and we drove\
  \ back to Atlanta because we had to catch our flight."
