Text: "Just imagine, stop what you are doing, and think about IT\nImagine, if you\
  \ got the biggest opportunity of your life.\nAnd you have only 2 minutes to decide:\
  \ to Stay or to go!\nImagine, you going to so far Away to have a meeting with yourself\
  \ in a magical place. Am I crazy?\nI know, it sounds ridiculous or something similar,\
  \ but it happened with me. \nI was born in a small city in the countryside of S\xE3\
  o Paulo, Brazil, with a population of only  5 thousand people living there.\nI had\
  \ never been abroad or travelled by airplane. I didn't speak any word in English.\
  \ But something in my soul was screaming inside of my heart, like calling me to\
  \ change everything in my life. I was bored, and so tired, the routine was not making\
  \ me happy or proud.\nI just decided: Ireland, I'm going!\nSo, I went and lived\
  \ in Emerald Island, for 2 years, learning English and working as a housekeeper,\
  \ waitress, cleaner and anything you could imagine. I have been in 21 countries\
  \ by myself, before I was in Bled, Slovenia.\nI had met God there. No, I'm not talking\
  \ about the spirit, like a God that some people can meet in the church or something\
  \ like that. I finally realized how strong I AM. I was there, AT the top of a big\
  \ mountain, looking at the most beautiful lake that I had ever seen, the perfect\
  \ blue, and I was felling the light wind touching my face.\nI had watched every\
  \ single detail that I had lived to be there IN that moment. I just remembered an\
  \ innocent girl that had left her home to discovered the world and the most important\
  \ thing: She met herself. \nI was into the unknown learning about the new cultures,\
  \ new people, new fellings.\nI had lived in 14 different houses in 2 years, I had\
  \ said Goodbye to a lot of people. I had slept in a trend in Venice and I saw the\
  \ snow in Poland. But nothing was more incredible then finding the God that have\
  \ been living inside of me. I'm making a local connection every day, everywhere\
  \ I AM. Because I discovered it is not about the place, it is about who I am, anywhere.\
  \ \nSome people say I'm lucky because I have been in so many countries, for sure\
  \ I am. But more important then this is who I met, myself. My soul is right now\
  \ like a free bird flying higher day by day. And if you ask me: How could you make\
  \ me happy? \nIt is easy, just give an opportunity to say my story to people and\
  \ listen to other experiences. Because life is not something you have or something\
  \ you are making, but it is about who you are. I didn't expect to find it, but I\
  \ found the best way to be happy:  love yourself, believe in yourself and never\
  \ give up on your dreams."
