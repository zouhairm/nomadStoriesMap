Text: "It took my eyes a few moments to adjust, a few more for my mind to realise...I\
  \ was in another country, India to be exact! It had been months since I felt the\
  \ comfort of my own bed, the smell of oil paint and turpentine that usually scented\
  \ my room, the familiar feeling of carpet beneath my feet. I missed my mums cooking,\
  \ my dads odd sense of humour (which we both shared),  my bathtub, and my friends,\
  \ but I also longed for adventure. I was finally here it seemed, standing at the\
  \ edge of the whole world, with nothing and no one to hold me back. I remembered\
  \ a promise I made myself years ago, to never let anyone hold me back ever again,\
  \ and here I was lying in bed with a feeling that no drug or person could ever give\
  \ me...complete and total freedom. I had made it to 32 without getting married,\
  \ not any having children, no debts, perfect health and still single. Was that a\
  \ good thing? I wondered. Suddenly, I heard my aunt calling me down to breakfast.\
  \ One thing you must understand about India is that regardless of what you think,\
  \ you are going to put on weight! There is no escape, you can\u2019t hide and you\
  \ soon become to fat to run, so just accept your fate and eat, I figured! Back home\
  \ in Australia a few pieces of buttered toast and jam would suffice me for breakfast.\
  \ To my delight however, my Aunty had prepared a delicious South Indian dish called\
  \ Puttu, one of my favourites. It\u2019s made with shredded coconut and steamed\
  \ rice flour, and there are a number of combinations to eat this dish. My favourite\
  \ way is with mashed banana, sugar, milk and ghee. In Australia, on the rare occasion\
  \ that we would eat Puttu for breakfast, my dad would always remind me that my grandfather\
  \ would eat puttu with coffee - a combination that I don\u2019t particularly care\
  \ for! After living in Australia for 25 years I had become accustomed to using cutlery\
  \ everywhere, and even now as I very slowly mashed my banana into the Puttu, I tried\
  \ to hide my anticipation which would have allowed me to eat a lot faster if I used\
  \ my hands. You can always tell when I am enjoying my food, because my feet will\
  \ be doing some kind of uncontrollable happy dance under the table. This morning\
  \ was no exception. After breakfast I decided I would go shopping. In new countries\
  \ I visit, as much as I love shopping, I never shop for the sake of shopping. I\
  \ enjoy chatting to the local vendors and making friends, learning their names so\
  \ I can say good morning when I pass by, checking out their products, and trying\
  \ to get a glimpse into their daily lives and routines. Going market shopping in\
  \ Thailand, Malaysia, China, Mexico, and India have been some of my most memorable\
  \ experiences because you can really get a feel for the people. Sometimes I just\
  \ sit close by with a sketch pad and some pencils, or a camera and just watch the\
  \ day unfold. This is life right here in front of me, I think, not being surrounded\
  \ by tall man made buildings, everyone in a suit, walking around as if they were\
  \ on a mission to save the planet. I\u2019m thankful my days of corporate life were\
  \ long gone, I no longer feel like a monkey in a straight jacket, a robot in my\
  \ own life, I was finally free. My journey all started 5 years ago, the day that\
  \ I decided to live my life to the fullest and be the best person I can be. The\
  \ 24th of May 2012....."
