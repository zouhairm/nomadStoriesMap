Text: "A Travel Story in form of Fiction\n\nLOG LINE -  A young guy of 30/32 years\
  \ old, dreamt to be an architect. But his fate did not allow him to meet his dreams\
  \ and he ended up being a car mechanic. But on every weekend he tries to live with\
  \ his dreams in a strange way. Does that impact more lives than only his own?\n\
  \ \nMimi and Ron met for the first time in front of Catskill Lighthouse. Mimi, like\
  \ a typical teenager of her age teenage, instantly falls in love with Ron, Ron Arora\
  \ \u2013 a handsome young man from London, architect by profession, and traveling\
  \ the world due to his profession. Mimi\u2019s parents also met the bright young\
  \ chap and liked him enough to continue their day visiting the city, together with\
  \ him.\n\n The simple demeanor of Ron, his depth of knowledge of history, background\
  \ and especially on the manmade structures - Bethel Woods Center for Arts, Thomas\
  \ Cole National Historic Site, Karma Tibetan Buddhist Monastery- just amazed them.\
  \ The day just flew by with lot of fun, chatter and laughter. They visited lots\
  \ of places like Catskill Animal sanctuary, Overlook Mountain, Sunfrost farm and\
  \ many more. Ron\u2019s compassionate behavior towards Mimi was the sign enough\
  \ for Mimi to think that he liked Mimi as well. Mimi starts dreaming.\n\n Mimi goes\
  \ back with the handful of memories with Ron, and with Ron\u2019s phone number,\
  \ fantasizing of turning her newly acquired friendship to a long lasting relationship.\
  \ But her world of imaginations shattered in a whisker as she faced a shocking truth\
  \ about him from her cousin Rusha. Ron is nothing but a car mechanic in a local\
  \ garage in Catskill, known as Dodo. Whatever he told about himself - is either\
  \ all a big willful lie, Or is just a  simple case of cheating with the emotion\
  \ of a teenager! Mimi will never get to know!! or is it something else that Mimi\
  \ would never get to realize - a make believe world of unfulfilled dreams that Ron\
  \ is dragged in. Mimi was shocked \u2013 unable to utter a word. She continues to\
  \ walk with Rusha in a trail of Minnewaska State Park, her head held down, feeling\
  \ a lump of pain coming up her throat, and a sudden drop of tear down her face.\
  \ Sense of getting cheated, or just pure empathy? \u2013 she can\u2019t say for\
  \ sure. \n\nLess than a few miles from Mimi, Dodo was with a group of students,\
  \ who he just met in front of the Museum of Bethel Woods. Like Mimi and her family\
  \ yesterday, these student groups were also mesmerized with his deep knowledge of\
  \ history, background and architectural details of Mr Deep \u2013 Deep D\u2019Souza\
  \ \u2013 A resident scholar in the California Architect Board.\n\n And for Dodo,\
  \ it just the last few hours of another weekend, the last few hours of living in\
  \ his dreams, before going back into the shabby walls of his motor garage \u2013\
  \ a dream which is lives in every weekend for last 7 years."
