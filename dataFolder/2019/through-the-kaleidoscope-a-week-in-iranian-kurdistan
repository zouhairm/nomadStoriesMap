Text: "Iran under normal circumstances is conflicting, misunderstood, but bewilderingly\
  \ fascinating. The sort of place where the longer you are, the less you understand\
  \ it. In its tumultuous spring of 2018, I came to learn that first-hand. \n\nWith\
  \ US sanctions looming, the Rial (local currency) plummeted. Banks closed overnight\
  \ and people took to the streets \u2013 a remarkable move under a regime known for\
  \ its erratic and often short temper. Society seemed in uproar, from Tehrani elites\
  \ frustrated by the lack of personal freedoms to urban middle classes scathing of\
  \ the all-engulfing corruption. Even the Islamic Republic\u2019s traditional backbone,\
  \ the conservative countryside, grew tired of endless economic downturns. \n\nWherever\
  \ I went, the disarmingly social Iranians were quick to discuss their take on the\
  \ situation.  Guidebook recommendations to avoid politics rang hollow when faced\
  \ with the energised, razor-sharp locals. A young student in a Shiraz garden sought\
  \ the return of monarchy. A teacher in the South West opined: \u201CIt\u2019ll just\
  \ be easier if the Americans invade and run the place\u201D. A uniformed soldier\
  \ didn\u2019t care what happened, as long as women were allowed to show their hair\
  \ again for all (including him) to see \u2013 he pulled me aside in a prominent\
  \ Esfahan mosque to tell me this, such was his eagerness. \n\nThe country was teetering\
  \ on the brink as I made my way to its perhaps most volatile province \u2013 Kurdistan.\
  \ My intentions were entirely apolitical. Remote and only intermittently accessible,\
  \ Iranian Kurdistan is meant to offer some of the world\u2019s most stunning spring\
  \ landscapes. But with torrential downpours trapping me between Iraq on one side\
  \ and impassable, muddy roads on the other, I stayed put for a few days, bearing\
  \ witness to a society in transition. \n\nThe scene greeting me as I stepped off\
  \ the bus was unthinkable in Iran: two women storming past defiantly without a headscarf.\
  \ The police were quick to follow but lost their trail. A young man approached me\
  \ and, following a short conversation, invited me to stay with him \u2013 as casual\
  \ as that. I had come to learn that with its boundless hospitality, the best way\
  \ to experience Iran is to simply let events take their course. \n\nA teacher, he\
  \ was like most young Iranians: well-educated, bitingly curious and intensely political.\
  \ I learnt just why so many young people wanted the shah (former monarch) to return:\
  \ \u201CYes, we had political prisoners under the shah. But then, my family were\
  \ just political prisoners. This regime executed them. I\u2019d rather have a regime\
  \ that treats its political prisoners with respect.\u201D A regime without political\
  \ prisoners was seemingly unthinkable in his Iran. \n\nOver the next few days, my\
  \ new friend showed me the Iran of the past (jovial goatherders overwhelming me\
  \ with food and dancing), present (3am kebab stall conversations with smugglers\
  \ risking death to bring Johnnie Walker from Iraq into the fiercely teetotal Islamic\
  \ Republic), but also future. Once surer of me, he asked if I wouldn\u2019t mind\
  \ talking to students at his school. \n\nI jumped at the opportunity. The first\
  \ question in the boys\u2019 class (education is, of course, gender-segregated)\
  \ didn\u2019t mince words: \u201CIsn\u2019t our regime stupid?\u201D I was used\
  \ to Iranian openness by then, but I had to triple-check with the teacher before\
  \ I was confident to offer my (diplomatic) response. Satisfied, the conversation\
  \ steered towards football, cars and property values. These boys seemed ready for\
  \ capitalism.\n\nThe girls were different. Only after a half-hour of gentle questioning\
  \ about London\u2019s culture did one ask timidly: \u201CSir\u2026 can we ask you\
  \ personal questions?\u201D. With the teacher\u2019s encouragement, I nodded. \u201C\
  Sir\u2026 do you have a girlfriend?\u201D Cue laughter. And then more boldly: \u201C\
  What do you think of the headscarf?\u201D It seemed to be the moment all their previous\
  \ questions were working up to. What I said was unimportant. The girls one after\
  \ the other spoke of their repressed identity, daily injustices and future hopes\
  \ \u2013 a rare opportunity to tell their stories to someone other than each other.\
  \ \n\nI noticed neither the boys nor girls talked about \u201Cif\u201D things were\
  \ to change. There only was the defiantly young \u201Cwhen\u201D. I wondered where\
  \ Iran goes from here. But wherever that is, I\u2019m certain it will remain utterly\
  \ confusing and endlessly mesmerising."
