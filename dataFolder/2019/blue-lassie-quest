Text: "The alley became narrower and narrower with every step. The speaking and shouting\
  \ got louder, filling out the space. The look in those dark eye-lined eyes felt\
  \ deeper, more penetrating than usual, as I was the only tourist walking past the\
  \ endless line of Indian men and women waiting for something I couldn't see.\_\n\
  \nI tried to keep walking, since going back seemed impossible. More than walking,\
  \ I let myself get carried by the crowd, while trying to focus on the stores surrounding\
  \ the dark space: tikka in bowls, flowers hanging from the ceiling and and Rudraksha\
  \ beads necklaces, those that are said to be God Shiva\u2019s tears turned into\
  \ seeds. \n\nVaranasi was showing me the crowded India I had seen in movies, far\
  \ away from the peaceful tourist-filled city of Rishikesh, where I had spent the\
  \ last two weeks. Even the Ganga had changed over here: it wasn't the clear Himalayan\
  \ water anymore, it had become darker and filled with offerings floating in it like\
  \ stars in a moonless night.\_\n\n-Excuse me, what is this line for? -I repeated\
  \ to different faces, bindis and looks, but getting the same answer from all: an\
  \ apologetic gaze and some words in Hindi.\n\nWhile the sweat mixed with the smell\
  \ of freshly fried samosas and the steam of masala chai, I couldn\u2019t help but\
  \ get angry at the shop owner that pointed out that way, saying it was the shortest\
  \ path to the last stop of my day: Blue Lassi Shop. That was my only mission left,\
  \ after I had seen the morning prayers and walked down the stairs that flow along\
  \ the Ganga. \n\nI didn\u2019t know yet that Blue Lassi was considered the best\
  \ place to have the sweet, cold, milky dessert, so popular in this part of the world.\
  \ So, I asked one last time where I could find it, not expecting anyone would reply.\
  \ \n\n-Blue Lassi? Follow me -said a skinny boy with a red kurta, the traditional\
  \ Indian clothing, walking fast and leading me in the opposite direction I was walking-.\
  \ This way is faster.\n\nSo, I followed. \n\nPriyanshu, the 18-year-old boy, made\
  \ fun of me for showing up at the same time as everyone waiting to enter the Kashi\
  \ Vishwanath Temple. Little did I know it was one of the twelve holy places dedicated\
  \ to Lord Shiva, the destroyer, who was also needed for the universe to be created,\
  \ as Priyanshu explained to me in his rudimentary English. \n\nHe held my hand and\
  \ pushed me through the mob of people. When we finally dodged them all, my improvised\
  \ guide took me to his home. It was an ashram, a place with dozens of beds and big\
  \ open common rooms to pray. Priyanshu has lived there since he was 5 years old,\
  \ among other boys preparing to be Hindu priests by praying, fasting and learning\
  \ Sanskrit, the ancient language of the sacred texts. \u201CWe are from the Brahmin\
  \ cast, the higher one\u201D, he told me with a big smile that shows off his white\
  \ teeth.  \n\nJust a quick stop before the actual destination, which was, in fact,\
  \ nothing like I expected it to be: a tiny blue place with a few seats and an infinite\
  \ amount of passport pictures from all the wanderer\u2019s souls that tried this\
  \ lassi recipe that dates back from over 90 years ago. \n\nWe order two, and while\
  \ we wait for what seemed to have been a mission worthy of Marco Polo, we contemplate\
  \ what is happening on the street, from the stillness of our little shelter. \n\n\
  A scooter avoiding a woman with a bright yellow kurta. \n \nA noisy motorcycle beeping\
  \ behind some dogs, the driver wobbling in between the people. \n\nOne, two, three\
  \ cows pass by us, ignoring the jam. \n\nA group of men singing and carrying the\
  \ inert body of a relative, wrapped in colorful fabrics and shiny ribbons, heading\
  \ to give their beloved one a final bath in the Ganga before cremating the body\
  \ and hoping for it to break the circle of reincarnation, as it\u2019s believed\
  \ happens when you die in this holy city.\n\nWe hold our big clay pots of lassis\
  \ and Priyanshu makes the toast: \"Welcome to India\"."
