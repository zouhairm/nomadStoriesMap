Text: "During my layover in South Korea, I took an hour train ride to gyeongbokgung\
  \ palace. After wandering around the beautiful palace I began exploring around the\
  \ area and found a temple where hundreds of people were lined up, waiting to get\
  \ inside. There were tall plants and small ponds with lily pads on them. The scent\
  \ of burning incense filled the air. It was so hot and humid, my clothes plastered\
  \ to my body. As I waited along side the hundreds of Koreans, a line of monks walked\
  \ past me and I noticed one specific monk was actually a woman. She wore white and\
  \ had a shaved head. I thought it was strange yet cool and couldn\u2019t get over\
  \ it. Finally, I got inside the temple. I had to leave my shoes outside. It was\
  \ jam packed on the inside. The whole experience felt like it was only a few seconds\
  \ long. Everything was moving fast. Beautiful hues of orange, red, pink, and green\
  \ colored the walls. Statues of Buddha\u2019s stood as high as the ceiling. I remembered\
  \ being in the center of the room facing monks and bowing to them. While having\
  \ my head to the floor, I prayed. We all prayed. It felt amazing to be in a foreign\
  \ country, surrounded by strangers yet feeling so connected. More connected and\
  \ safe than I have ever felt in my own country. It was the purest experience I\u2019\
  ve ever had. I never thought I\u2019d find a tiny temple hidden in a city like that.\
  \ I often think about that memory and I\u2019m beyond grateful that I got to experience\
  \ it."
