Text: "I went away. Far away, like in all of the fairytales, but the thing was that\
  \ going away didn\u2019t meant for me the happily ever after. This was just the\
  \ beginning, a journey where I was looking for something or someone. Knowledge,\
  \ profesional realization, true love maybe.\n\nI didn\u2019t know\n\nAt the begging\
  \ it looked like a dream, a new city that I was easily going to rule. I was a conqueror\
  \ from outside ready to get all the richness of the land and been admired like a\
  \ goddess. \nJust the same way the country I was visiting did to my land in the\
  \ beginning. \n\nThe first month was exciting, a challenge getting to know everything\
  \ in the little time I have.  I was living in a constant excitement for the next\
  \ thing, couldn\u2019t wait for the next adventure to start, to meet new people\
  \ and explore another life. \n\nBut then it came, the darkness, the scary, the loneliness,\
  \ all the demons from inside and out. The battle wasn\u2019t been won. When I look\
  \ around I felt like a failure, alone. Spain was the country of the sun but for\
  \ me it never felt colder.\n\nI came, I see an there was only one step left. Win.\n\
  \nI was alone, with no one by my side. When the people I knew didn\u2019t wanted\
  \ me to see them, the ones that I thought were the closest left me behind. And when\
  \ you are lonely you start to talk to yourself.\nI spend the most time with myself,\
  \ and I was annoyed. They said you gotta love you because the only one it\u2019\
  s gone be by your side forever it\u2019s yourself. \nThe realization of hate got\
  \ me to touch bottom.\n\nMadrid it\u2019s full of adventures, the city never sleeps,\
  \ the party never stops. You are surrounded by an historic city that in every corner\
  \ has something amazing to show you. You can cry your feelings out in the Parque\
  \ del Retiro, or been the happiest at the Prado Museum, explore all the life of\
  \ Picasso and Dal\xED in the Reina Sofia art museum.\n\nThe months went away and\
  \ I kept learning from Madrid, knowing it to the bottom. From beginning to end.\
  \ \n\nAnd the most I kept learning from Madrid the most I realize that the only\
  \ thing I didn\u2019t expect to find in there was myself."
