Text: "\u201CLet\u2019s go, one more to cover up, we are taking to another lovely\
  \ place\u201D said my friends, Manca and Alenka. \u201CWhat is it?\u201D I asked,\
  \ with an exciting look on my face. \u201CLet me guess the options\u201D, I reacted\
  \ again, expecting one of them could be right. \u201CUmm... Nope\u2026 Nope \u201D\
  \ my friends laughed as they captured my \u201COh, it\u2019s not right\u201D expression.\n\
  \ \nA kickass morning of 2nd October 2018, superb blend of slight rain showers with\
  \ temperature of 10 degree Celsius and little of golden sunrays. Ahh\u2026 It was\
  \ indeed a pleasant environment.\n\nDrive of 45 minutes to such a tranquil place\
  \ from Bled was astonishing moment for me. I can still sense that calm road bounded\
  \ by far visible high Alps elevation of 2,864 meters - few covered with white glittering\
  \ snow, front lush shades of greenery, blue turquoise crystal water, whitish and\
  \ gray pebbles, gravels and stones, traditional style wooden and stone structures\
  \ lead us to \u2018K r a n j s k a  G o r a\u2019 \u2013 A beautiful town at elevation\
  \ of 806 meters in northwestern of Slovenia. An adventurous place equipped with\
  \ endless possibilities for hiking, trekking, cycling and skiing \u2013 a doorstep\
  \ for travelers.\n\nLater came stopover to precious hidden gems - Beauty of Sava\
  \ valley with its waterfalls and lakes:  \u2018Lake Jasna\u2019 showcasing reflection\
  \ of mountains in clear bluish water and \u2018Zelenci Springs\u2019 nature reserve,\
  \ home to flora, carnivorous sundaes, amphibians and nesting birds. Water from underground\
  \ Nadia creek emerges through porous bottom of 2m deep lake. It was a breathe taking\
  \ moment for me. A phase came where; I just sat quietly for few minutes without\
  \ whispering a word and seizing this Slovenian beauty in my eyes.\n\nApproaching\
  \ our footsteps through \u2018Picturesque Alpine Town\u2019 with colorful view,\
  \ came every person\u2019s favorite time \u2018Where to Eat\u2019. I quickly responded\
  \ \u2018Let\u2019s explore local cuisine at local restaurant\u2019. As we walked\
  \ along narrow lanes there it was \u2013 an atmospheric Tavern restaurant with country\
  \ farmhouse vibe named \u2018Gostilna Pri Martinu\u2019 \u2013 old dishes with huge\
  \ portions \u2018Totally Delicious\u2019.\n\nSmall conversations with local people,\
  \ couple of folks playing musical instruments, children riding their bikes and last\
  \ but not the least picking up a souvenir, the time passed and day was getting over.\n\
  \n\u201CSomeday, I am going to visit this place again for sure\u201D, I told myself\
  \ with bit tears of joy.\n\nLost in such a splendour, slideshow of images were still\
  \ rolling in front of eyes. Amazing day made by my dearest \u2018Slovenian Friends\u2019\
  , whom I met just a week before for International Autumn School at Technical University\
  \ of Munich, Germany, was really a splendid experience for me. \u2018Havla vam\u2019\
  \ meaning \u2018Thank you\u2019 Slovenian Landscapes were my last words while departure.\
  \ And then I further headed my solo trip to Croatia \u2013 Beginning of next adventure.\n\
  \nThat was a moment where this proverb became more meaningful to me........\n\u201C\
  Travelling \u2013 It leaves you speechless, then turns you into the storyteller\u201D"
