  \nWhen your cell phone is constantly sending you a reminder that you have no more\
  \ free space, you are forced to search for things that you can delete. At such moments\
  \ you find all kinds of little treasures, and one of them was the note I wrote five\
  \ months ago.\n\nReading my words, I had the feeling I was back there. I could feel\
  \ the fresh and cold air on my face; I could see again miles and miles of ice glittering\
  \ in the spring sun; I could even hear the Australian guy standing beside me screaming\
  \ of excitement while the piece of ice crashes into the water.\n\nBut also reading\
  \ the text I realized that indeed I found a beautiful new place on this planet,\
  \ about which I will talk to people every time they ask me how it was in Argentina,\
  \ but also in that place something unexpected found me.\n\nAt that moment I had\
  \ the feeling that everything fell into place and that I have it all clear. \nAll\
  \ of my questions were answered. All my doubts resolved. All my insecurities no\
  \ longer mattered.\n\nI finally found the truth about life.\nTHE TRUTH ABOUT MY\
  \ LIFE.\n\n_ _ _\n\nI'm here at the Glacier Perito Moreno just taking a moment to\
  \ sync in what I have in front of me. It's so powerful! I can hardly describe it\
  \ in words. Every time I find myself in places that are so overwhelming I cannot\
  \ to think how fascinating nature is and how grateful I am to have a chance to visit\
  \ and to get to know its masterpieces. \n\nBut at the same time, I cannot ignore\
  \ the feeling that gives me. The feeling that we are so small and irrelevant. That\
  \ life is so short, just a blink of an eye, and that we should live instead of survive.\
  \ That we should take more risks, say YES instead of saying no, get out of the comfort\
  \ zone, believe in something bigger, try to take a leap of faith every single day.\
  \ We should more BE than do! We should deliver ourselves to the moment and not to\
  \ the fear that lies in our minds. We should delete from our dictionary sentences\
  \ that start with WHAT IF or MAYBE ONE DAY. \n\nI do not know whether this is a\
  \ wonderful sight in front of me talking or maybe I finally started to live what\
  \ I'm writing about. Also, when we are talking about writing, I am just noticing\
  \ that my fingers are completely frozen. \n\nBut, before I go, I must admit that\
  \ while I was writing this, a little tear fell down my cheek. \nI do not know whether\
  \ it's a tear or happiness or sadness. \nI guess only time will tell me that.."
