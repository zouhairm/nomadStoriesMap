Text: "July 4th of 2014. Around 9:27 pm (oh boy, photographic memory) , taking and\
  \ grabbing what I considered necessary in my pockets: a cellphone, obligated to\
  \ keep calm my people I thought left behind, and a wallet, carrying more sand than\
  \ cash. I went down hill to the beach. The expectancy of a farewell couldn\xB4t\
  \ have been more neutral. Making myself sure that everything was fine, took a ride\
  \ on the most popular avenue of the place. End of town, dirt road. Darkness. Full\
  \ batteries, incoming call, greeting them, smile on face, dressing shirt.\n\nFinished\
  \ the call, back on the road, and I got myself a nice room and a palm tree. Dim\
  \ lights, good enough to rest, and at the horizon, the Passion Island.\nThe next\
  \ morning, the loudest red macaw ever woke me up. It didn\xB4t bother me at all.\
  \ With one hand I could count of waking up and smiling at the same time. \n\nKept\
  \ walking on the coast, found some local people, and invited me join to breakfast,\
  \ listening to our stories, and our mixed emotions of laughter and seriousness.\
  \ \"So what are you doing here, man?\" , one of them asked me, finally. \"Are you\
  \ on vacation?\" , insisted. \"Nope. Not really. But it\xB4s OK. Cheers!\" . Of\
  \ course, there was beer. \n\nThe days went by, the walks to the light of the Moon,\
  \ changed from quiet to exotic. And yet, I kept waiting for something; in the meantime,\
  \ the rain remembered to visit us. Almost out of contact, but I\xB4ll give a point\
  \ for the plastic bag, protecting my phone. Out of the nest, I watched so many colors\
  \ that I felt dizzy, and fell asleep on a beach chair. I forgot for just one night\
  \ that comfy palm tree at 8th Avenue. \n\nJuly 22nd. With sunshine over me, I woke\
  \ up because of a kid. Around 5 or 6 years old. He was running, his parents joined\
  \ to the football game... it was faster than expected, but I realized the kid was\
  \ looking at me, while getting the ball. Smiled, and returned to his parents. Not\
  \ bad for someone that almost forgot how to smile. Good enough to end My journey,\
  \ and to start a new one, walking by and finding someone waking up on a beach chair,\
  \ and making them to embrace this feeling."
