Text: "Faced with an exhausting day, many trails and countless waterfalls that seems\
  \ the come out from fairy tales, the night seemed more like a haven of all the excitement\
  \ I had to deal with during the day, as well as a chance to recharge. Arriving in\
  \ the city of Len\xE7\xF3is, I am surprised by a view of a quiet place, narrow streets\
  \ with houses of attractive colors that reveal the colonial history that this city\
  \ possessed, the small river that crossed the bridge formed small natural pools\
  \ with a darkened water which were quite attractive for a relaxing bath and which,\
  \ according to the guides, possessed a generous amount of chemical components and\
  \ that I could soon discover that such properties of this water did very well even\
  \ for the hair (yes, I was able to test and to prove it, my hair seemed to have\
  \ come out of an advertisement). With the end of the afternoon the city began to\
  \ gain more life, with the arrival of the tourists of the most diverse tracks the\
  \ place became very receptive, either by the food or the warmth that that region\
  \ provided, the most ample diversity met there, people of several countries talking,\
  \ some with their native language, others risking to speak Portuguese when ordering\
  \ a typical Brazilian dish. While walking along these alleys one could hear singers\
  \ singing some songs by Tom Jobim or some other MPB singer, giving more emphasis\
  \ to Brazilian culture, hippies sitting on the sidewalks was trying to sell their\
  \ art, then I make a question for two of them about why they have chose this one\
  \ place as their stay and the answer was clear and unison: this city exudes peace.\
  \ I agreed, I could not agree more, this city seemed to have stopped in time and\
  \ it is not in a negative way, quite the contrary, it was liberating not to be stuck\
  \ in the future, when you are in Len\xE7\xF3is you just worry about being there,\
  \ it does not matter what is happening in the rest of the world, because your world,\
  \ at that moment, is summed up in that. As I walked a little more I have decided\
  \ to enter a restaurant with a purple facade and a romantic air that soon attracted\
  \ me (Do what ?! I'm an incurable romantic), after delighting myself with a shrimp\
  \ moqueca with a good orange juice , I saw a couple in front of me, as they approached\
  \ my table they sold me a brigadeiro, I, curious that I am, I questioned the two\
  \ about their love story who soon told me their brief history, she, Brazilian, came\
  \ to Chapada Diamantina with some friends he went out alone, also on a walk, and\
  \ just like 1 + 1 is 2, they soon fell in love with each other and decided that\
  \ this city was the ideal place to live and so they perpetuated his love, and to\
  \ get money were selling candy and their arts to build their own house. After thanking\
  \ me, they went on to another table and I looked at them for a moment and could\
  \ not disguise a smile and when I returned to my hotel being illuminated by the\
  \ Moon and observing the life that existed in that city I could realize that I could\
  \ not get a lover for me that day, but nourished a love for this city, if I may\
  \ well call it a little piece of paradise, and I knew from that moment that Len\xE7\
  ois had gained a space in my heart."
