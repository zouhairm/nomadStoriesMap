Text: "I made the mistake (one of many) of exchanging very little money at the airport.\
  \ I was a first-time traveler and the only advice on the matter I had was that the\
  \ airport exchange rate was never good. In Oeiras, 20 miles outside Lisbon, there\
  \ are no place to exchange money. I met someone that told me the bank could exchange\
  \ money. I went to the nearest bank and they sent me straight to the manager. She\
  \ informed me that without an account with the bank they could not exchange my US\
  \ dollars for Euros.  She then quietly took me aside and said that if I don't have\
  \ enough euro, she would personally exchange my dollars for me. When I went back\
  \ to the \u201Crecidencia\u201D, where I was staying, I communicated with Umbelina,\
  \ through the google translate on her 1998 computer. I asked if I could pay for\
  \ my stay with dollars, she wrote into the translator, \u201Cabsolutely not,\u201D\
  \ and \u201Cwhenever I get Euro I can come back and pay, calma.\u201D She made a\
  \ hand waving motion, I thought there was jam on them or something. \nI moved to\
  \ downtown Lisbon a few days later, exchanged money at the main train station, and\
  \ returned to Oeiras to pay Umbelina. I took the long way back to my airbnb, turning\
  \ a 30 minute walk to 3 hours. I found a small caf\xE9 open late and ordered a giant\
  \ omelet and bread, and was handed the whole jar when I asked for jam. \nThrough\
  \ some Russian couchsurfers, I met Pedro, he kept making the brushing hand waving\
  \ motion. He said Portuguese people can communicate with this hand motion alone,\
  \ it means \"whatever, its all good.\" After our meetup, Pedro\u2019s dad drove\
  \ me all the way home to Lisbon from the bar in Oeiras at 2am. \nOne night while\
  \ wandering with Pedro, at the peak of our fatigue and hunger, it started to rain\
  \ as we became lost in the narrow streets of the old Lisbon, Alfama. We were both\
  \ getting wet because we couldn't both fit under an umbrella. The ratio of person\
  \ to umbrella in Lisbon must be 1:1, no less! We were frustrated with each other\
  \ and kept missing the bar we were looking for which (in)conveniently said it was\
  \ closed on the front door. Inside the bar there was a buffet of food. A few hours\
  \ later we got on stage at this bar and performed a song completely off key, in\
  \ Portuguese and English while deep into a Lisbon-rain quantity of wine. The bar\
  \ owner, from Cape Verde, played some crowd pleasers. \nI hadn't had enough of Cape\
  \ Verde and found out that \u201CArtCasa\u201D was having live Cape Verdean music.\
  \ When I showed up the band was playing but only 5 people sat on couches scattered\
  \ around the room. I insisted on dancing in the middle of room and over time there\
  \ was less and less room to dance. Someone invited me to dance and I had to accept\
  \ the fact that he was moving his hips much more impressively than I was. He refused\
  \ to give up on teaching me how to move the way he did. He spoke Portuguese, Italian,\
  \ a little French and a little English, which was exactly sufficient for two people\
  \ that have just met. Then I found a chess board and played against a Cape Verdean.\
  \ The chess board was missing many pieces which we replaced with cups of beer, and\
  \ just hand waved through it."
