Text: "\u201CAloha. Welcome to Hawai\u2019i,\u201D the taxi driver said as he approached\
  \ me with a warm smile at the airport, stretching out his right hand before gently\
  \ placing his left over mine as if to solidify his sincerity.\n\nMy phone battery\
  \ died and as he slowly lifted my luggage into the trunk of the taxi at Lihue airport,\
  \ I nervously tried to locate the airbnb apartment address that I had scribbled\
  \ on a note and slipped into my wallet. \u201CI\u2019m sure you\u2019ll find it,\u201D\
  \ he smiled, \u201Cno need to worry.\u201D\n\nThe word Aloha is visible everywhere,\
  \ but it does not simply mean 'hello' or 'welcome' as most would think. It is deeply\
  \ embedded in Hawaiian culture, the very spirit of how Hawaiians choose to live.\
  \ It is an inherent respect for the eternal connection between the individual and\
  \ nature, the fixed relationship between your soul with the fabric of the world.\
  \ Compassion and empathy are weaved into every action and decision, into every word\
  \ and emotion where the suffering of others would mean your own suffering. Nature,\
  \ animals, the earth itself is a part of who you are.\n\nAloha is a commitment to\
  \ take care and protect the environment one lives in just as much as one would take\
  \ care of themselves. There is no individual, but an individual consciousness as\
  \ part of a collective whole. As globalisation begins to transform our world, the\
  \ concept of individualism means that people identify themselves as separate from\
  \ nature, where our priorities are to protect our own assets and whatever is of\
  \ benefit to us and those important to us alone.\n\nThis is why we are beginning\
  \ to see the impact through global environmental degradation, where deforestation,\
  \ pollution and urban sprawling oils the mechanics of globalisation that only strengthens\
  \ this distance between us and nature. Aloha, the suffering we are supposed to feel\
  \ for harming nature and failing to protect this cultural spirit is lost to the\
  \ idea of buying the best things or looking attractive.\n\nI chose to remember that\
  \ when I spent several weeks travelling between the islands with only a seven-kilo\
  \ backpack that contained a few bits and pieces of old clothing that re-washed and\
  \ re-used daily. Make-up? Not a chance.\n\nHawai\u2019i is not just Waikiki and\
  \ surfing but offers the opportunity to really absorb oneself into nature and culture,\
  \  each island conveying its own unique personality. Snorkelling with turtles, swimming\
  \ near waterfalls, there is so much you can do! It was amazing driving through The\
  \ Big Island and visually witnessing the sharp climate changes with significant\
  \ differences in the landscape \u2013 from dry and arid to tropical rainforest \u2013\
  \ in only a few minutes that proves just how wonderful the eight climate zones that\
  \ encompass such a small island can be.\n\nFor those like myself who love to trek,\
  \ Hawai\u2019i has so many different trails, my favourite being Kalalau Trail (Kauai).\
  \ The Kalalau Valley along the N\u0101 Pali Coast offers the most stunning views\
  \ that truly inspire a deep appreciation for the Hawai\u2019ian landscape. There\
  \ is the option of breaking up or extending the trail into a multi-day and the short\
  \ but strenuous Kalepa Ridge Trail is dangerously close to the cliff edge that the\
  \ adrenalin is thoroughly  spectacular. Unlike Australia, you won\u2019t find dangerous\
  \ animals lurking about the bush, in fact, that only danger you have is either falling\
  \ or something falling on you! \n\nVolcanoes National Park (The Big Island)through\
  \ Kalapana road (12km) to the volcanoes is only the first leg of this amazing trail\
  \ and the beginning is littered with bike stalls to help ease the hike into a short\
  \ ride. Moving right when you reach the end of the road and hiking for another 8kms\
  \ over the dried lava is absolutely monumental where you eventually reach very close\
  \ to pockets of molten lava that oozes out of the ground. Leaving in the afternoon\
  \ and taking along a torch, I was lucky enough to hike back as it became dark where\
  \ I experienced the milky way and stars above me.\n\nIt is easy to understand 'Aloha'\
  \ when you visit Hawai'i. As said by Henry D. Thoreau: \"We need the tonic of wildness...\
  \ We can never have enough of nature.\""
