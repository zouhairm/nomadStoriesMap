Text: "The muddy brown liquid was scooped out of the drum by a plump, amiable woman\
  \ before she set the jug down on the table in front of us. Before pouring us each\
  \ a glass my host, Daniel, poured some of the liquid onto the floor.\n\n\u201CTo\
  \ Pachamama,\u201D he declared.\n\nThen, he wetted his fingertips with the same\
  \ murky liquid, before flicking it skywards.\n\n\u201CTo the apus.\u201D\n\nAfter\
  \ I repeated him, Daniel explained what it meant. Before you drink chicha, a corn-based\
  \ drink popular in rural Peru, it\u2019s customary to make an offering to Mother\
  \ Earth (Pachamama) and the mountains (apus).  \n\nDaniel was the owner of my hostel,\
  \ a project that he and his wife had recently taken on after their retirement. They\u2019\
  d moved from their hectic lives and family in Cusco to the nearby town of Pisac.\
  \ Seeing that I was travelling alone, and that we shared a love of food and drink,\
  \ Daniel wasted no time in introducing me to the culinary customs of the Sacred\
  \ Valley.\n\nAfter telling him that my parents were chefs, he clapped his hands\
  \ together. \u201CTomorrow, I\u2019m going to show you how to make pesqu\xE9, and\
  \ then we are going to go to a ch\xEDcheria,\u201D he exclaimed, \u201Cthen you\
  \ can tell your parents all about it.\u201D \n\n\u201CUmm, okay,\u201D was my response.\
  \ I didn\u2019t know what either of these things were, but it sounded like a good\
  \ deal. \n\nAfter spending the morning making the pesqu\xE9, an unusual dish from\
  \ quinoa and whatever else was lying around in the fridge, it was time to go to\
  \ the chicher\xEDa. Because Daniel\u2019s hostel was a casa del campo (country house),\
  \ we had a bit of a walk ahead of us to the local village. Showing surprising agility\
  \ for a man of retirement age, he rolled under a barbed wire fence, beckoning me\
  \ to follow. After his neighbour berated him for running across the field, he shouted\
  \ that he was the owner.\n\nImpressed by my host\u2019s wealth of real estate, I\
  \ asked him if this was true. \n\n\u201CClaro que no!\u201D he replied, with a devilish\
  \ wink.\n\nOf course not.\n\nAfter traversing a number of corn fields that we probably\
  \ shouldn\u2019t have been in, we arrived in the nearby town of Taray \u2013 a ghost\
  \ town compared to its more popular neighbour Pisac. I preferred Taray. \n\nWe continued\
  \ past tin-roofed shacks and farmhouses until we reached a non-descript brown gate,\
  \ where behind we could hear the gobble of turkeys, the bark of a dog, and the sound\
  \ of rapid-fire Quechua coming from a foreboding Peruvian matriarch.\n\nDaniel grinned\
  \ to me and opened the gate for me to go first. I entered what I could only describe\
  \ as a run-down shack and took a seat on some garden furniture that was well past\
  \ its best. Daniel spoke to the woman who had sounded so intimidating from the other\
  \ side of the gate. Inside, her voice was soothing yet full of laughter, as she\
  \ poured the chicha into the jug.\n\nAfter we toasted Pachamama and the apus, Daniel\
  \ explained to me how chicha was made. However, his story was often interrupted.\
  \ Many of the village\u2019s farmers trickled in, older men taking a break from\
  \ the midday sun. They greeted each other like old friends (probably because they\
  \ were), and when Daniel introduced me, they were only too happy to welcome a guest\
  \ into their ritual. \n\nIf I could liken a chicher\xEDa to something from my home\
  \ country, I\u2019d say it was like an old-fashioned British social club. The men\
  \ came here to talk about football, their wives, and laugh and jokes about anything\
  \ and everything, all under the watchful eye of the matriarchal owner. She could\
  \ be very intimidating if one of their jokes had overstepped the line\u2026\n\n\
  I don\u2019t know if it were being Daniel\u2019s guest, or the fact that one of\
  \ Peru\u2019s greatest footballers, Nolberto Solano, had played for my local team,\
  \ but I was welcomed into the group like they\u2019d known me for ages. I\u2019\
  m really grateful that Daniel gave me the opportunity to see a side of Peru that\
  \ many travellers don\u2019t.\n\nIt\u2019s just a shame that chicha really didn\u2019\
  t taste very nice!"
