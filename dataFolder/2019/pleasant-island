Text: "Legend has it that 12 tribes from Micronesia set sail some 3,000 years ago,\
  \ with primitive fishing resources and an intimate understanding of the mysterious\
  \ deep sea and the creatures that lived there. Eventually the trade winds and ocean\
  \ currents drifted them toward the tiny island now known as the Republic of Nauru.\
  \ \n\nAlmost halfway between Australia and Hawaii, Nauru is one of the most isolated\
  \ countries on that planet. However, this blip on the radar has had its fair share\
  \ of visitors. A passing whaling ship captain was the first westerner to step foot\
  \ on \u201CPleasant Island\u201D as they called it in 1798, and since then Nauru\
  \ has been home to approximately 10,000 locals, neighbouring islanders, and expatriates\
  \ alike.\n\nMeasuring 21 square kilometers, it will take you approximately 28-minutes\
  \ to circumnavigate the coastline by car, or if you\u2019ve ever wanted to, you\
  \ can walk or run around this entire country. So far, no one has ever swum around\
  \ the island due to strong under currents and sometimes violent waves that break\
  \ along the protective outer reef wall.\n\nAt the turn of the 20th century, Nauru\
  \ was discovered as the world\u2019s richest known source of phosphate; a fancy\
  \ term for age-old bird shit. Phosphate was used to make fertilisers and dynamite,\
  \ and so followed an uninterrupted mining boom for 100 years bringing extravagant\
  \ wealth to the nation.\n\nYou still get a sense of that decadence when you stay\
  \ at the Menen Hotel. A total time-warp, this hotel wreaks of 1960s grandeur with\
  \ its lilac and powder blue colour scheme. You can almost imagine what it would\
  \ have been like for Queen Elizabeth to stay there when she stayed as part of her\
  \ royal visit in 1982. Nowadays, all over the island you\u2019ll find only remnants\
  \ of the old colony, including a breathtaking lookout from the now dilapidated mansion\
  \ of the former President.\n\nA treasure trove of WW1 and WW2 relics are also easy\
  \ to find, and provide some very Instagram-worthy photo opportunities. Seaside Japanese\
  \ bunkers can be turned into the ultimate yoga mat, and every sunrise and sunset\
  \ allow for the most holy of sun salutations. A moderate walk-climb through the\
  \ \u201Cbomber track\u201D phosphate pinnacles is where you\u2019ll find the hidden\
  \ wreckage of US aircraft and intact tankers with their guns still aimed at the\
  \ clouds. The ivy-draped walls of the old Japanese prison is a haunting tourist\
  \ attraction, shaded in bushland near the island\u2019s peak, just 71 metres (233\
  \ ft) above sea level.\n\nThe Nauru Museum and community library are well worth\
  \ a visit, and entry is free. Hundreds of amazing black and white photos capture\
  \ both the traditional \u201Cold Nauru\u201D life of the indigenous tribes, juxtaposed\
  \ against colonial British and German forces; think men in grass-skirts holding\
  \ pushbikes. \nThe year-round tropical heat swelters, inviting you to dive into\
  \ the iridescent turquoise water at Anibare boat harbour. The warm ocean current\
  \ will leave you feeling cleansed of the day. Jagged pinnacles dot the beachfront\
  \ all around the island and reef shoes will make for a more pleasant swim at any\
  \ time. When the wind Gods show favour, brave surfers chance their arm at the large\
  \ reef breaks, and although no fatalities have ever been recorded in the surf, plenty\
  \ a snapped surfboard have floated back into the bay. Being the only stop for miles\
  \ of ocean, Nauru is a giant floating mushroom-shaped fish food pellet, and tuna\
  \ stocks are beyond bountiful. A fishing charter run by the local supermarket, Capelles,\
  \ is an idyllic way to spend a morning or an afternoon and you\u2019re almost guaranteed\
  \ yellowfin or skipjack tuna sashimi for dinner. There are quite a few good Chinese\
  \ restaurants on island, but for a quick, fresh takeaway you can't beat local fishmongers\
  \ Mr Chippy's, opposite the Anibare boat harbour. Salty fish, cucumber salad and\
  \ coconut fish are local delicacies worth tasting.\n\nHowever, by far the definitive\
  \ pastime enjoyed by all who visit Nauru is to meditate on the undulating waves.\
  \ In tune with rhythm of the sea, there a sense of connection to voyagers of past\
  \ years that travelled from beyond the horizon in every direction to find rest on\
  \ \u201CPleasant Island\u201D. \n\nNauru Airlines has direct flights from Brisbane\
  \ and connecting flights from Fiji, the Solomon Islands and nearby Kiribati departing\
  \ most days of the week."
