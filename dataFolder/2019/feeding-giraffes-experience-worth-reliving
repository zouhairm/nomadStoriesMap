Text: "In its towering nature, the giraffe remains a graceful giant. The most wildlife\
  \ lovers ever get close to it are photographs and videos. The Giraffe Centre in\
  \ Nairobi gets you get up-close with the giraffe in feeding sessions. They will\
  \ reach out with their long tongues for some crunchy snacks, making for some photographic\
  \ moments. The experience is next to none and you might find yourself spending three\
  \ hours or so.\n\nExperience\nAnd for the little ones, this was the moment they\
  \ wish went on and on. As the tourists fed the giraffes, the pupils enjoyed the\
  \ sight of the tongues popping out every now and again.\nThey giggle, and while\
  \ at it, the teacher is joined by the tour guide who offers them snacks so that\
  \ they can feed the giraffes too. Cheekily, they hold out the snacks and soon the\
  \ giraffe reaches out to feed.\n\nExcitedly, in fetes of shouting out loud, their\
  \ peers encourage them on with clapping and ululations. The thrill about feeding\
  \ a giraffe is the rough edges of its tongue which turns ticklish as it feeds out\
  \ of your palm.\n\nThe giraffes co-exist with warthogs as a form of protecting them\
  \ from predators. The warthogs are a forgetful lot which makes them easy prey, meal,\
  \ if you like, to prowling fellow wild animals.\n\nSights\nNairobi has offerings\
  \ in different places but wildlife in the middle of the city is astonishing because\
  \ it gives you the option of seeing it without having to drive for hours in anticipation.\n\
  \nThere is Nairobi National Park, the Elephant Orphanage and The Giraffe Centre,\
  \ all within reach. At the centre, the tour guides are knowledgeable and openly\
  \ share information about giraffes.\n\nThere are different types. You will find\
  \ some of it on the centre\u2019s website. The Africa Fund for Endangered Wildlife\
  \ (AFEW) Kenya was founded in 1979 by the late Jock Leslie-Melville, a Kenyan citizen\
  \ of British descent, and his American-born wife, Betty Leslie-Melville.\n\nThey\
  \ began the Giraffe Centre after discovering the sad plight of the Rothschild Giraffe.\
  \ A subspecies of the giraffe found only in the grasslands of East Africa,\u201D\
  \ reads history of the centre on its online platform.\n\nIt is open every day from\
  \ 9am to 5pm. Non-resident adult part with $10, non-resident children $5, resident\
  \ adults KShs250, resident children KShs50 and free for school groups if they book\
  \ one week in advance.\n\nRemember to carry a valid identity card. Proceeds from\
  \ entry fees go towards the conservation education work with students and teachers\
  \ across Kenya.\n\nOn my recent visit, I got a chance to meet a Ugandan at the centre\
  \ who serves as a security guard. As I chatted with a friend, she joined in as she\
  \ went about her job of searching visitors at the security check point."
