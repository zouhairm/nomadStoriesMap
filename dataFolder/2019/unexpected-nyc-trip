Text: "At the end of February, I took a trip with some friends to Orlando, Florida\
  \ from Toronto, Ontario. We drove down as we like road trips, and we were supposed\
  \ to be there for a week, Sunday-Sunday. However, some arguments came up and I decided\
  \ it would be best if I went home early. I looked up flights and buses, buses were\
  \ by far cheaper, even though flights were shorter. I took the bus. I caught a cab\
  \ from the hotel to the Greyhound bus station in Orlando, and from there I was on\
  \ my own, travelling from Orlando back home to Toronto. I hopped on my bus at 1:10pm\
  \ and the first stop was Jacksonville. Just before we got off the bus there, the\
  \ driver made an announcement and said if you\u2019re going to New York, leave your\
  \ stuff on the bus and reboard at 530. I thought \u201Cawesome, I\u2019m going to\
  \ Buffalo and I have enough time to grab food\u201D. So I got off, left all my stuff,\
  \ went for a smoke, bought food and sat in the bus terminal and waited. Well at\
  \ about 515 I looked at my ticket & realized, this bus I just got off of was not\
  \ going to Buffalo but instead it was going to NYC. I panicked. I went up and asked\
  \ for help, I had a wonderful man named Mark look after me, he was able to help\
  \ calm me down after I broke into tears and he even got me on a bus to Buffalo from\
  \ NYC. He came with me for one last smoke and then made sure I got on the right\
  \ bus and even gave me his work number to keep him updated on my trip. As I\u2019\
  m on the bus from Jacksonville, Florida to Savannah, Georgia. I took a few minutes\
  \ to read my itinerary and I noticed, I got a 4 hour layover in NYC, I\u2019ve never\
  \ been before this trip, so I called my mom and I told her everything, she laughed\
  \ at me and told me to go have some fun in the Big Apple. I was asleep most of the\
  \ bus ride but when I wasn\u2019t, I met some incredible people and learnt their\
  \ stories and where they were from or where they were going. Although when we parked\
  \ in NYC, none of the people I made friends with went there so I was truly on my\
  \ own. That didn\u2019t stop me. I called my mom as I was exiting the bus terminal\
  \ and seeing the city for the first time. It was beautiful. I almost cried. I had\
  \ walked around Times Square, watched a few street performers, grabbed a beer in\
  \ Times Square, and just took in that I was actually standing in the city that never\
  \ sleeps for the first time, ALONE. It was a dream come true to be there and it\
  \ was all done on accident. I bought a souvenir because I wanted a memory of my\
  \ trip to NYC. I did make it to my next bus to Buffalo and got home safely, but\
  \ all in all, NYC was the best part of that whole trip. If I didn\u2019t leave Orlando\
  \ early, I may have never gotten to go NYC the way I did. Totally amazing experience\
  \ and I would do it again in a heart beat."
