Text: "I\u2019ve learned when you see an overwhelming number of happy police officers\
  \ and paramedics, something interesting is going on. On this particular cloudless\
  \ Sunday morning, weaving through the crowd gathered in Italy\u2019s small Northwestern\
  \ town of Ivrea, I found just that hustling to get to the main town square. The\
  \ air thick with horse manure, fresh citrus, and the forever lingering Italian fragrance\
  \ of tobacco, set the tone as men and woman prepared for the Battle of Orange. Impulsively,\
  \ on the word of a friend, I hopped on a train with little knowledge of the festival\
  \ I was traveling to attend. I knew a bit about Carnival however, what I heard about\
  \ Ivrea\u2019s celebration, was unlike anything I had ever heard of before. Curious,\
  \ I boarded an overflowing train to see it with my own eyes. What I found resembled\
  \ a Saturday Night Live parody of gladiator warfare. \nI\u2019d heard the stories\
  \ of the momentous crazy orange fight but, what I didn\u2019t expect was the infectiously\
  \ violent, yet friendly, energy it possessed. Struggling to see the battle in action\
  \ behind protected spectating heads, I meandered down to street level. I saw many\
  \ other people in their Phrygian caps, which indicate you\u2019re a non-thrower,\
  \ at street level and gambled injury for authentic experience. From there, I saw\
  \ people beat each other relentlessly each with mighty oranges. They chased every\
  \ horse drawn chariot who stormed the town squares. Duellers shook hands, congratulated,\
  \ and thanked each other for the pulpy combat. In consideration to the violent nature\
  \ of the festival, this seemed a commendable act of sportsmanship. Lost in amusement,\
  \ I let my guard down. In half a second an orange bigger than a baseball hit me\
  \ directly in the collarbone. Cursing my lack of attention in high school dodgeball,\
  \ I laughed off the pain along with the locals. As the fighting died down, I cautiously\
  \ slid over cobblestone caked in the fresh juice of thousands of Sicilian oranges\
  \ dispersed, flung, squeezed, and left to decay as the only unwilling victims of\
  \ the first day of battle. Gliding past me were pulp coated gladiators; dressed\
  \ head to toe in the garb of their chosen team. I\u2019d lost track of the bloody\
  \ noses and blackening eyes that gallivanted past me. The playful irony was each\
  \ busted lip I saw heading back into the juicy brawl gleefully wore an ever swelling\
  \ smile. Children, like their parents, proudly wore welts like scouts badges. \n\
  This event, which dates back to 1808, is the rebellious heart of a normally quiet\
  \ town. Varying tales describe the legend of the Miller\u2019s daughter who, along\
  \ with the townspeople, killed their Lord tyrant relinquishing his power by throwing\
  \ stones to slay his knights. The legitimacy of the legend, though relevant to many\
  \ of the traditions surrounding the festival, is rather unimportant. In my opinion,\
  \ the festival today is much less about the story of a Miller's daughter who may\
  \ or may not have stabbed a tyrant with his own sword. The most valuable role the\
  \ Miller\u2019s daughter plays in today\u2019s festival is the generous and hefty\
  \ contribution of as much as 50 000 euros her title requires. Those oranges have\
  \ to come from somewhere! The legend prolongs the battle\u2019s life year after\
  \ year in a cultural and, to an extent, historical significance that cannot be argued.\
  \ Its origins and traditions merely serve as justification for the continuations\
  \ of the somewhat brutal, as it has been criticized, but hilarious fanfare of drinking,\
  \ playing, and encouraged aggression. \nThe festival meets sporting event is composed\
  \ of seven rebels teams who compete for judges\u2019 favours in order to win the\
  \ grand prize; nothing. Though there is a panel of judges, whose criteria for exceptionality\
  \ I\u2019m still unsure of, the winning team wins only pride in orange slaying.\
  \ Regretfully, I could only see one day but I would recommend you see this absurdly\
  \ hilarious spectacle with your own eyes. My shoes, covered in a small portion of\
  \ the 555 tons of pulpy compost deposited from the annual event, stepped carefully\
  \ as I left a dwindling parade of soldiers ready to drink away their bruises, behind\
  \ me. The sweetest part? My free snack on the train home."
