Text: "I didn't expect to love Germany as much as I did. It was never in the top of\
  \ my travelling list until I met someone from there and finally got the opportunity\
  \ to start this adventure.\nI was 17 so I had to wait a year not only because I\
  \ wasn't allowed to travel before turning 18 but also because I needed money, so\
  \ I saved it for a whole year and in April of 2018 booked the flight ticket for\
  \ July 25th.\nJuly 25th came and the adventure started. I arrived there at luch\
  \ time and I couldn't believe how hot it was there. I've always had this picture\
  \ in my head that Germany was a cold country even in the summer. Of course I wasn't\
  \ expecting snow in the end of July but still didn't expect such a strong heat.\
  \ I came from Portugal and I can tell you it was a lot hotter in Germany.\nI was\
  \ there for two weeks. Two amazing weeks in fact. I did so much and ate so much\
  \ good food and honestly it was such an incredible place to take pictures. I haven't\
  \ travelled to other countries that much yet but I can say the photos I took in\
  \ Germany are my favourite so far.\nI stayed at my boyfriend's place which is in\
  \ the countryside and one hour away from Munich (more or less) and half an hour\
  \ away from this nice little city called Landshut. I loved both the city and the\
  \ countryside. Munich reminded me a bit of Lisbon with all the fancy buildings and\
  \ stores and one thing I really loved about it was this cute little market that\
  \ had people selling lots of flowers, fruit and fresh vegetables. The art and design\
  \ museums were amazing and very cheap which is all i can ask for in a city.\nThe\
  \ countryside was beautiful and I saw so many amazing sunsets there. The corn fields\
  \ and sunflowers everywhere make it such a nice place for walks and for a person\
  \ that has never seen so many sunflowers together, I was amazed.\nI was a vegetarian\
  \ back then and the amount of options I had was amazing and always delicious, even\
  \ in local restaurants. \nWe went hiking once and usually I hate all kinds of exercise\
  \ but that experience was amazing and the day was beautiful and even in the mountain\
  \ the restaurant had a delicious option for me. The views were amazing and I learned\
  \ wich places (now covered with green grass) would be full of snow in the winter\
  \ and used for skiing. Afterwards we went to a lake called Chiemsee Lake and tho\
  \ I liked the way it looked I didn't stay in the water for too long because of the\
  \ grey mud on the bottom and that would suck my feet and it was so soft that it\
  \ felt weird and I wasn't comfortable at all. In this trip I also learned that most\
  \ lakes where we're allowed to swim are like this which was probably the only thing\
  \ I didn't enjoy but still loved the way they look.\nGermany was a great experience\
  \ full of amazing food and places and I am sure I will be back soon and maybe this\
  \ time I'll be able to see snow."
