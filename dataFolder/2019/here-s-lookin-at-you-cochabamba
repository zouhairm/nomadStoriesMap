Text: "The Bolivian cafe\u2019s name was \u201CCasablanca\u201D. The old movie posters\
  \ on the outside walls were enough to draw me in, but it was the welcoming ambience\
  \ inside that seduced me to stay. Little tables were scattered in no discernible\
  \ order, with soft amber lighting drawing me closer. Vivid murals of a saxophone\
  \ player, a smoky bar, and characters from the movie were so vivid that I wanted\
  \ to be a part of that world. \n\n\tAfter gawking like the tourist I was at that\
  \ moment, I spotted something that made me actually guffaw\u2014a life-sized standing\
  \ cardboard cutout of Humphrey Bogart. He was in his trench coat and hat and holding\
  \ his ever-present cigarette, and he was looking at me with that famous come-hither\
  \ gaze.  I said yes and sat next to him. Bogie never left my side as I languished\
  \ in the intoxicating atmosphere, sipping an excellent cappuccino and periodically\
  \ writing by the dim light. I kept looking up at him, shaking my head at the unexpected\
  \ presence of Bogie in Cochabamba, and when my drink changed from coffee to wine,\
  \ I just had to toast him with a corny \u201CHere\u2019s looking at YOU, kid.\u201D\
  \n\n\tMy time in cafes while traveling is usually spent being a voyeur, a student,\
  \ or a writer. I was all of those things that night while listening to the Spanish\
  \ conversations around me. Since I was in Cochabamba, Bolivia, for three weeks to\
  \ study Spanish, I rationalized that eavesdropping on my neighbors was simply another\
  \ method of honing my Spanish. That first night at Cafe Casablanca, emboldened by\
  \ the caffeine, the wine, and a little encouragement from Bogie, I pushed aside\
  \ insecurities about my Spanish ability and struck up a conversation with the couple\
  \ at a nearby table.\n\n\tIt wasn\u2019t long before our laughter drew the server\
  \ and the bartender into our conversation. I told them that it had been Bogie who\
  \ persuaded me to sit down. The bartender got a kick out of that, and soon we were\
  \ throwing out famous quotes from the movie. We agreed that our favorite, and the\
  \ most appropriate considering our situation, had to be \u201COf all the gin joints,\
  \ in all the towns, in all the world\u2026\u201D When I returned the next time,\
  \ the bartender greeted me with a hug, saying, \u201CBogie is waiting for you! He\
  \ saved your seat!\u201D \n\t\n\tDuring those three weeks in Cochabamba, I became\
  \ a regular at Cafe Casablanca. Although I didn\u2019t always get to sit close to\
  \ and share a drink with Bogie, this place had become \u201Cmy\u201D cafe in this\
  \ Bolivian town that was feeling more and more like home. In fact, the little city\
  \ is highlighted in my travel journal as a possible place to return to for an extended\
  \ stay\u2014maybe three months next time instead of just three weeks. \n\n\tAnd\
  \ if I ever do go back to Cochabamba, I\u2019ll be looking for Bogie at our usual\
  \ spot. I mean, who would have imagined that a woman from the USA would start up\
  \ a relationship with Humphrey Bogart in a cafe named Casablanca while studying\
  \ Spanish in Bolivia?"
