Text: "When I was a child, I spent every summer in my mother`s village. Fonyod is\
  \ a typical holiday resort: during the winter, it is a ghost town (where you can\
  \ walk hours on the deserted beach and you will not meet a soul, apart from the\
  \ odd ice-windsurfer[2]),  but during the summer, the beaches are jam-packed with\
  \ tourists.  And if you get bored of swimming and sunbathing, you can choose a completely\
  \ different activity \u2013 there are festivals, wine tasting tours or historical\
  \ tours available.\n\nSometimes when the heat became unbearable - or simply, for\
  \ a change -, I went hiking. I wanted to reach Sipos Mountain Lookout[3] on its\
  \ top of Sipos Mountain. It is an easy, twenty minutes hike from the beach if one\
  \ knows the short cut through the woods. And it is well worth the trouble since\
  \ from the Lookout you can enjoy a stunning panorama of the whole Lake Balaton and\
  \ the volcanic mountains on the opposite side[4]. (Words won`t do it justice, so\
  \ see the attached pictures).  \n\nOn my way to the Lookout, I walked past a modest\
  \ villa several times, but I was not thinking too much of it - until I learned its\
  \ name. It is called Kripta Villa (Crypt Villa \u2013 which is quite an unusual\
  \ name for a villa in Hungary where villas are usually named after the family which\
  \ owns them). The beauty of its tragic story matches the beauty of the landscape\
  \ around it[5]. Our story began when a young pharmacist, Odon met a beautiful lady,\
  \ Magdus. They fell in love, engaged to get married and then, all the sudden, tragedy\
  \ struck: 3 weeks before their wedding day, Magdus died. The devastated Odon could\
  \ not quite get over her: he decided to look for a spot of land so he could build\
  \ a memorial house for her. In 1940, Odon discovered Sipos Hill, and the construction\
  \ work began.\n\nAnd the villa he commissioned has been fascinating our imaginations\
  \ ever since then. Despite Odon`s best efforts, locals soon learned about the controversial\
  \ living arrangements (and started calling the villa `Kripta Villa`). And the living\
  \ arrangements were controversial indeed: upstairs, Odon was leading a normal family\
  \ life with his wife and his children (by this time, he got married). But downstairs,\
  \ the room was refurbished with Magdus` belongings and its centerpiece was a life-sized\
  \ stone bed, engraved with the figures of the two lovers, lying next to each other,\
  \ holding hands. Underneath the stone bed, there was a tomb chamber (Odon planned\
  \ to get buried there, next to her beloved Magdus, but sadly, his dream never manifested).\n\
  \nThe terrace of Villa is now a restaurant, where you can enjoy a glass of wine\
  \ \u2013 I would recommend `Badacsonyi Szurkebarat`, which is a white wine from\
  \ St. George Hill, on the opposite side of the Lake[6] \u2013 and you can watch\
  \ how the sunset paints a glowing golden bridge (`arany hid`) onto the water. You\
  \ can make thoughts of life and death, love and loss, trauma and emotional healing.\
  \ And that`s when a journey becomes a journey to our innermost soul.\n\n________________________________________\n\
