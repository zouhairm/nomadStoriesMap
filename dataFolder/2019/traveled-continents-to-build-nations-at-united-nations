Text: "After a rigorous one year of MBA and a sound selection process, I was one of\
  \ the fortunate students from all across the globe to be a part of internship programme\
  \ at United Nations headquarters, located in New York, United States of America.\
  \ Being the only Indian to be selected for this internship at that point, it was\
  \ a complete package of responsibility, pride, and joy.\n\nI applied through their\
  \ online portal and was contacted by the executive office after 1-2 months with\
  \ online test and interview details. The test was more on the analytical and consulting\
  \ front followed by a telephonic interview about the background, perspectives, and\
  \ expectations.\n\n\n18 hours of flight time and 3 hours of halt at Abu Dhabi landed\
  \ me to a city that never sleeps (referred to as Gotham at times). A middle-class\
  \ boy, in States, was mesmerized by the lights around Times Square, skyscrapers,\
  \ magnificent architecture, multi-million dollar cars, and an overwhelming crowd.\n\
  \n\n\nOn the first day of my internship, I was introduced to everyone on my floor\
  \ and to my amazement, every other person was from a different country altogether.\
  \ The floor-walk felt more like a walk around the globe to different nations.\n\n\
  At United Nations, my function was to utilize my experience of analytics to support\
  \ peacekeeping operations by providing valuable insights to Department of Peacekeeping\
  \ Operations and Field Support with their reimbursement decisions by verifying deductions\
  \ against MOUs (signed by member states \u2013 Troop/police contributing countries).\n\
  \nThe office environment was amicable; I was fortunate enough to be a part of a\
  \ few celebrations and \u2018Happy Hour\u2019 events at UN. Interning at United\
  \ Nations had its perks, we were allowed to be a part of almost all international\
  \ meetings/conferences/events being conducted at around UN premises including Security\
  \ council meetings. I was fortunate enough to be a part of some security council\
  \ and general assembly (GA) meetings including the latest and hot topic of Gaza\
  \ immigrants around Israel border and North Korea\u2019s nuclear strategy. Sometimes,\
  \ we were invited to special events organized at Permanent Missions \u2013 with\
  \ boring meetings but free food and drinks \U0001F600\n\nThen there were \u2018\
  Thirsty Thursdays\u2019. Interns groups from all around UN Secretariat, agencies\
  \ and permanent missions gathered at Calico\u2019s (a nearby bar) to grab a drink,\
  \ socialize and test their networking skills with a lucky draw to choose a select\
  \ few for free drinks.\n\n\n\nI am not at all a morning person but morning runs\
  \ on the street of NYC was not less than a delight and boost of freshness. A 12-min\
  \ run from Times Square to Grand Central was always fun, with fresh air, parks,\
  \ impressive crowd and of course the glamorous stores.\n\nOverall, it was a fun\
  \ and enriching experience with the enormous amount of exposure to other worlds\
  \ and cultures, conversations with some fascinating people, challenging work, fantastic\
  \ crowd, and extraordinary events.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t less than a delight to find\
  \ myself at a 200-acre brand new facility of IIM Rohtak, secluded from all the hassles\
  \ of campus-sharing. From here, I\u2019m looking forward to more such experiences\
  \ of traveling around the world and learning about various cultures and practices\
  \ in the business/public domain while trying to make my way to a managerial position\
  \ after MBA."
