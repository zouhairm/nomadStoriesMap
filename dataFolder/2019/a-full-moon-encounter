Text: "After stepping off the crowded trains that took me from Delhi to Vrindavan,\
  \ the rickshaw drivers interweaved an intricate counterpoint in pursuit of some\
  \ rupees: \u201CTaxi Sir\u201D, \u201CISKCON temple Sir\u201D. Unluckily for them,\
  \ I wasn\u2019t a common tourist or pilgrim. I was in the middle of a backpacker\
  \ journey from Indonesia to Mexico in which music became my mobile orchid-ATM, my\
  \ \u201Ccouchsurfing\u201D that introduced me to kind souls, and my travel agency\
  \ that booked me kilometers to move forward my way home. \n\nIn this unexpected\
  \ voyage fueled by faith and love, India was the toughest test. The reasons: It\
  \ has too many people in material poverty meanwhile the few rich people I knew where\
  \ mainly greedy. To crown it, anti-street performance policies in big cities had\
  \ led musicians, fakirs, jugglers and other itinerant artists to an apparent extinction.\
  \ With the few money saved by busking, I decided to make a flash trip to the rural\
  \ areas to experiment older layers of the millenary Hindu culture. Vrindavan, due\
  \ to its proximity and the emotional tie born when I intermittently visited ISKCON\
  \ temple in Mexico, was undoubtedly the best option.\n\nFortunately, my arrival\
  \ coincided with Hanuman\u2019s birthday; so the numerous temples were perfumed\
  \ with incense and prayers, whereas the streets were livened up with musical and\
  \ dance parades on his honor. After wandering around while recording unrepeatable\
  \ soundscapes, I found a modest museum of mechanical puppets depicting Krishna\u2019\
  s life episodes. My hearth was fulfilled with devotion!\n\nBy nightfall, I rested\
  \ in a flower bed around a kadamba tree and tried to sleep, but mosquitoes prevented\
  \ me. I didn\u2019t had money for a hotel; and although I knew I would be welcome\
  \ with the \u201CHare Krishnas\u201D, I wished to be in contact with local folklore\
  \ because next day I had to return for a musical audition in a Mexican restaurant.\
  \ \n\nAround midnight I searched for a better place, and just around the corner\
  \ I passed by a young brunette man carrying a coverless harmonium. I smiled, he\
  \ greeted me, we presented each other and then he inquired about the instrument\
  \ I was holding. \u201CIt is a jarana, a kind of Mexican ukulele\u201D-I answered\
  \ while opening its case. \u201CPlay something please\u201D-he told me with a bright\
  \ smile, so I performed \u201CLa Xochipitzahuatl\u201D, a traditional Mexican song\
  \ about the mother Tonantzin-Guadalupe.\n\nLastly, he offered me shelter and we\
  \ walked to the outskirts of silent Vrindavan. Once we arrived he extended a canopy\
  \ on the grass and gave me a blanket. Exhausted plus lulled by the cricket\u2019\
  s symphony under the full moon, I dreamed. In the morning, the birds and the bells\
  \ of the distant temples sonorized my first moments. While stretching out I observed\
  \ the surroundings: grazing cows, moringa trees, marihuana plants and a far forest.\
  \ As I approached the mud house, I smelt a familiar aroma and joined my new friend\
  \ and his uncle in smoking pot in a clay chillum. When his uncle leaved to farm,\
  \ my host brought his harmonium and sang pleasant melodies in a morning raga, whose\
  \ name I can\u2019t remember. \n\nWe took a bath, breakfast and later he guided\
  \ me to interesting sightseeing in downtown. In the market he bought a sack of wheat\
  \ that we alternately carried through the streets, originating reverential postures\
  \ in some locals that witnessed the curious scene. Back home we got high again and\
  \ he showed me his amazing pencil drawings. I told him I would bring him a box of\
  \ colored pencils if I return, and asked him to draw a map of his home in my travel\
  \ notebook. Thereon he made a bread baked with ashes in his furnace of earth, we\
  \ added curd and eat. Just delicious! \n\nAfter a nap, it was time to go for my\
  \ audition. As my friend was still sleeping, I said good-bye to his uncle and leaved.\
  \ That night the owner didn\u2019t arrived but thanks God I could get money from\
  \ another source to continue my journey. Five years later I am opening his beautiful\
  \ map in my old notebook, hoping destiny allows me to go back to that holy land\
  \ and greet again my luminous friend whose name was written in the bottom: Chandra\
  \ (moon)."
