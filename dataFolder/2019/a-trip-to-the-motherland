Text: "My story begins at Belgrade Nikola Tesla Airport, as a surge of unease flooded\
  \ my body. I always thought that I had been a risk taker, ready to step outside\
  \ of my comfort zone at any notice, but not this time. I went for one reason: to\
  \ reconnect to my family\u2019s country. I had never been before and as I was living\
  \ in Rome, it seemed to be a perfect time. I had a decent grasp on the language\
  \ and enough false confidence that I figured would guide me through the Easter holiday.\
  \ \n\n\nThe one thing, though, that I kept in the back of my mind: why did I wait\
  \ until Easter to go to Serbia when I\u2019ve been living in Rome since August?\
  \ My hesitancy is hard to explain, as I still didn\u2019t understand it, at least\
  \ at that point. \n\n\nSo there I was, walking through Belgrade\u2019s main airport,\
  \ trying to become numb to my nerves when I ran into my wonderful cousin who I would\
  \ be spending the next five days with. He drove me out of the city, past the bleak\
  \ gray buildings, some still surrounded by rubble from the bombings in 1999. \n\n\
  \nWe drove for about an hour to the small town of Vrsac. There were two strangers\
  \ in the car. My cousin is a driver, taking people between Belgrade and Vrsac. I\
  \ was uncomfortably hot but was too nervous to take off my black, tight bomber jacket.\
  \ So, I just sat there apprehensive and awkward. \n\n\nAlthough I was a bit familiar\
  \ with my cousin, the language, and the culture, that first day was a leap into\
  \ the unknown. I had no close friends or family around me and I was out of my comfort\
  \ zone. But I knew that I had to go that weekend or I would regret it for the rest\
  \ of my life. \n\n\nThe next five days are a blur of genuine and truly fun memories.\
  \ The stress that I felt as I was arriving soon dissipated as everyone I met made\
  \ me feel at home and seemed as though they were honestly interested in knowing\
  \ me and my life. \n\n\n\nMy fondest memory of my time there was being at a nightclub\
  \ on Easter morning. I assumed that we would be getting up early and going to church.\
  \ But there we were at 12 am, kissing everyone around us three times on the check,\
  \ celebrating the holiday as I was stumbling around a bit too drunk on rakija. \n\
  \n\nAfter I left, I realized the anxiety I had on the flight over and the first\
  \ day was a fear of unacceptance. This was the culture and language I knew from\
  \ the American perspective. So I felt as though I did not really know what I was\
  \ signing myself up for. Yet, there I was, in a tiny village in northern Serbia,\
  \ being accepted warmly by the friendliest people on planet Earth. I left Serbia\
  \ understanding that I did belong, I am a part of the culture, and I am a part of\
  \ that place."
