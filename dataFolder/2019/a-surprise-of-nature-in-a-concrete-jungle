Text: "Endless walls of grey and colour, splattered with windows, rise up in every\
  \ direction around you. A concrete jungle of epic proportions spanning miles, seemingly\
  \ endless. But only seemingly\u2026 for surrounding the crowded, bustling city of\
  \ Hong Kong are incredible panoramas of mountains, forests, oceans; an entire world\
  \ of nature just a bus ride away. \nWhen one first thinks of Hong Kong the mind\
  \ goes to the countless skyscrapers the city is so well known for, but despite the\
  \ perception of a bustling business city, Hong Kong has some of the most beautiful\
  \ and accessible nature. It is an unexpected dichotomy whose starkness can only\
  \ be understood in person. \nMy first run through of travel guides and \u201CHong\
  \ Kong\u2019s Top Ten\u201D style lists contained all the classic markets, food,\
  \ and architecture, but it wasn\u2019t until a while after landing that I realized\
  \ how much natural beauty the city contained; inside and out. \nWithin my first\
  \ few days after settling in and making new friends, four of us decided to head\
  \ out to Lantau Island to see the Big Buddha. We hopped on the MTR at Kowloon Tong\
  \ and in less than forty minutes we were at Tung Chung station. From there it was\
  \ an easy walk to the gondolas which take you all the way up Ngong Ping village.\
  \ The gondolas depart from the outskirts of the city and as you leave the skyscrapers\
  \ behind you are soon in the middle of rolling mountains covered in green trees.\
  \ The Buddha itself is encased in a beautiful forest and the walk up the stairs\
  \ yield many sites of nature and wildlife. Just be careful to not get too close\
  \ to the spiders.\nJust days after this first encounter with the nature of this\
  \ incredible city, I found myself in Hong Kong Park. Here, in the center of downtown,\
  \ is where you can truly see how stark the difference is. As you stroll through\
  \ this park with palm trees stretching high above you and birds chirping around\
  \ your head, it only takes a glance up to see that you are never far from the looming\
  \ buildings that reach even further into the sky. There is a conservatory to walk\
  \ through with many diverse climate rooms, and a maze-like outdoor aviary where\
  \ you weave through the treetops to the ground. But step out of both these areas\
  \ and you find yourself back within sight of the concrete walls and reflective windows.\
  \ My friend and I were in awe of this optical illusion being played on us, our minds\
  \ baffled as to whether we were deep within a gorgeous, lush forest where we could\
  \ be lost for days\u2026 or simply in a mirage of greenery still within a busy city.\n\
  But that is the beauty and wonder of Hong Kong. A city of mysteries you didn\u2019\
  t expect just waiting to be found. Around every corner is there a park, a monument,\
  \ some history, or more buildings - it is impossible to know what you\u2019ll get\
  \ and it will always be a surprise. I came to Hong Kong with an expectation of city\
  \ life and nothing but buildings, but I left having seen wildlife and beaches, waterfalls\
  \ and cliffs, climbed up mountains and into valleys. All these adventures, and more,\
  \ as close as one train or bus ride away and ready to be explored\u2026 So, what\
  \ are you waiting for?"
