Text: "After two weeks traveling on the North of Brazil we were all just tired and\
  \ ready to go back home. But with only day left we couldn't accept the idea of leaving\
  \ Bel\xE9m without visiting one of the many islands that surrounded the city. So\
  \ we took the suggestion of a friend and scheduled a boat trip to Ilha do Comb\xFA\
  , a beautiful fragment of the Amazon Forest only 15 minutes from the city. I must\
  \ admit that I wasn't thrilled with the idea of spending the day on a boat after\
  \ the many turbulent boat rides we took during our trip, but I did wanted to get\
  \ a glimpse of the majestic forest that covers part of my country so I tagged along\
  \ with the group. And it was best decision I could have taken. \n\nA few minutes\
  \ after we left the port at Bel\xE9m we entered the river that crosses the Island\
  \ and it felt like opening the door to a new universe. The forest was dense and\
  \ a variety of trees surrounded the river on both sides leading our heads up to\
  \ the sky as we tried to see where they ended. The sound of cars and street vendors\
  \ were substituted by the singing of birds and the laugh of local kids who enjoyed\
  \ the hot day by the river where the water was clean and the stream wasn\u2019t\
  \ strong. Swimming in a river is one experience a recommend everyone who is fond\
  \ of being in the water. But even a professional swimmer can be swept away by a\
  \ strong stream, so it is important to make sure you know the region before jumping\
  \ into the water. The day was then followed by a visit at a local chocolate factory.\
  \ The day was then followed by a visit at a local chocolate factory. The Amazon\
  \ Forest is known for being the native habitat of many species of trees, including\
  \ the cacao. One of the employees showed us the cacao trees that the used for the\
  \ chocolate and the almost artisanal process of its transformation into chocolate.\
  \ She also took us on a walk through the island to show a little bit about their\
  \ community and how they used the resources from forest to survive in a sustainable\
  \ way. Our trip wouldn't be complete without a stop to eat one of the most delicious\
  \ dishes of the Northen culinary: a bow of freshly prepared a\xE7ai cream with tapioca\
  \ flour.   \n\nOur last stop of the day was at Ilha do Papagaio (Parrot\u2019s Island),\
  \ a small Island next to Ilha do Comb\xFA known for being the home of hundreds of\
  \ Parrots. The trip to the Island is most commonly done at sunrise, when the birds\
  \ leave the island for the day. But due to a lack of planning we had no other choice\
  \ than to see their return to the Island. The sun had already sat and it was starting\
  \ to get dark when we began listening to the loud sound of birds as they approached\
  \ their home. They came mostly in groups and gathered with the other parrots flying\
  \ in circles above the island almost like in a synchronized dance. I was already\
  \ mesmerized when the real spectacle of nature started. One by one, the parrots\
  \ began looking for their partners, and after pairing up they would fly together\
  \ to a tree branch on Ilha dos Papagaios. The flock slowly downsized as the lovebirds\
  \ continued to do their flight back home. And we watched it in silence until there\
  \ was no more light."
