Text: "Crossing another country by land was something new for me. I had this experience\
  \ for the first time when I visited Singapore and tried to cross the border to get\
  \ to Johor Baru, Malaysia. I took the MRT to Woodlands from Geylang, the MRT was\
  \ full at that time as usual and I was sitting there wearing my favorite red cap,\
  \ didn\u2019t care to any doubt. \nI grew up in Indonesia where gadgets are considered\
  \ exclusive and whenever I go, I will always keep on guard to my belonging especially\
  \ my gadgets. At that time, I used this smartphone and it was the only smartphone\
  \ I had. Going by electric train in Indonesia means that you have to stand with\
  \ others side by side just like in the subway and you have to keep an eye to your\
  \ gadgets no matter what, and that was what I did when I was in MRT in Singapore,\
  \ I always held my bag tight and kept an eye to my gadget until I realized that\
  \ no one would steal my phone because everyone in the MRT were mostly using the\
  \ newest released phone and I was laughing myself for being so insecure.\nAlong\
  \ the way to Woodlands, I saw the building of houses, schools, and trees. Everything\
  \ was so neat just like my Sims game. Aaah I feel so amazed with the tidiness of\
  \ these architectures. \n\u201CNext stop, Woodlands\u201D, says the announcer of\
  \ the MRT. \n\u201CYes, I made it\u201D, I told myself proudly. But then I just\
  \ knew that I needed to cross the border by bus, there was no connecting MRT to\
  \ Malaysia. So I got off from the MRT and I walked to the bus stop where everyone\
  \ was also queuing to get to the next bus. I was waiting almost an hour, it was\
  \ really hot and many people seemed impatient as well because of the weather. Next\
  \ to the border, I saw different look of people. I could see those familiar faces,\
  \ oh I feel home! Malaysia and Indonesia are like twin, we share almost same cultures\
  \ and language but we are still different. \nThe bus finally arrived and I went\
  \ in, it was so packed. My petite body perfectly fit the space, it was almost impossible\
  \ for me to get the grip to balance my body. But God knew how I was struggling at\
  \ that time, a grandpa who was sitting in the front row of the bus behind the driver\
  \ suddenly poked my shoulder and said \u201CSit here, with me\u201D. I was so happy\
  \ and I sat with him, the happiness turned to another different level when I suddenly\
  \ read the notice says, \u201CThis seat is only for elder and child\u201D. Hmm okay.\
  \ I was holding myself not to laugh because I was 22 years old at that time trying\
  \ my luck to go overseas for the first time. I looked around me and it turned out\
  \ that some passengers noticed and smiled at me. I was seeing the grandpa and he\
  \ seemed cool. \nI got off the bus after arriving at the border building. Everyone\
  \ was in rush and trying to get checked to pass the border. When it came to my turn,\
  \ the officer said \u201CHati-hati\u201D means be careful in Indonesian and he stamped\
  \ my passport. I was officially in Malaysia after stepping forward. \nFrom that\
  \ moment, I realize that no matter how far we go, you will meet good people. You\
  \ will always find home through the people you meet. As T. S Elliot once said -The\
  \ journey not the arrival matters-"
