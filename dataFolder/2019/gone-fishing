Text: "\u201CKanna! Kanna!\u201D someone shouted. I looked around to see women backing\
  \ away slowly from a certain spot on the ground. Kanna means lizard in Jaxanke,\
  \ the local dialect of the village. Sure enough, someone takes a stick and uses\
  \ it to cautiously lift up a four foot long, russet colored monitor lizard that\
  \ was found dead among the tall yellow grass, next to the pond we were all about\
  \ to go fishing in.  \n\nWe are approximately two miles outside our village, standing\
  \ at the edge of a wide pond, with cows grazing around us. Indigo and crimson colored\
  \ birds fly between the branches of nearby papaya trees. It is 125 degrees Fahrenheit,\
  \ and the humidity feels like I am wrapped in a heavy blanket. \u201CCome on Coumba!\u201D\
  \ Hearing my Senegalese name being called, I turned back around to see my friend,\
  \ Fanta, had already waded into the murky water. She looked back to see me frozen.\
  \ I know what a relief it would be to wade into the water, but I cannot help but\
  \ anxiously wonder what else is lurking in the dark, opaque water besides fish.\n\
  \n\u201CWhat if there are other Kanna or snakes in the water? Are you not scared?\u201D\
  \ I asked her. Fanta then explains, \u201Cbefore we go into the water, everyone\
  \ does a prayer asking Allah to keep us safe while they try to catch fish. Afterwards,\
  \ nothing bad happens to us.\u201D I am still a little skeptical, but at this point\
  \ I notice the rest of the village women getting into the water with their fishing\
  \ nets. In America, fishing seems to be a more male dominated activity. However,\
  \ in rural Senegalese village life, women are responsible for catching fish with\
  \ circular nets woven from thick, sturdy rope. I had never gone fishing in America,\
  \ but I also knew I would not experience fishing like this in America.\n\nI take\
  \ my shoes off, tie the bottom of my skirt around my knee, pick up my fishing net,\
  \ and carefully make my way into the water. The cold water was a welcome shock against\
  \ my skin, and for the first time in weeks, I momentarily forgot how hot it was.\
  \ The soft, flat ground under my feet made it easy to walk. Fanta and I walked to\
  \ the middle of the pond, where the water reached our stomachs. Our nets were submerged\
  \ under water.\n\nFanta pointed to a group of women over on the far side of the\
  \ pond. They gathered in a big circle formation, crouched down and held their nets\
  \ under water, and each slowly waded forward until they all met at the center of\
  \ the circle. They do this formation to help lock in any fish in the middle of the\
  \ circle. Then, they lift up their nets to see if any fish swam into their net.\n\
  \n\u201CI saw movement in the water! There is fish on this side.\u201D one woman\
  \ calls out to us. We crouch down with our nets and walk until we reach where she\
  \ is. We make a circle formation with our nets and walk forward until we all meet\
  \ in the middle. I eagerly lift up my net to scan for any caught fish. Nothing.\
  \ Fanta exclaims in delight. She managed to catch one and it was writhing furiously\
  \ in her net.\n\nI hear a squeal from nearby, \u201CI felt something touch my leg!\u201D\
  \ Laughing, we run over to join the women, water splashing everywhere. We encircle\
  \ the area with nets to capture any fish, and steadily drag our nets underwater.\
  \ \n\nA little while later, I decide to take a break and sit down at the edge while\
  \ watching everyone meticulously scour the water. \n\nUltimately, I did not catch\
  \ anything, but I did not feel like I left empty handed. My first fishing experience\
  \ in Senegal was a time filled with excitement and laughter. I was grateful to Fanta\
  \ and the women who showed me their method of fishing, a method so new and novel\
  \ to me.\n\nAs Fanta climbed out of the water, she signaled that it was time to\
  \ go. As we walk back home, I cannot help but ask her, \u201Ccan we go fishing tomorrow?\u201D"
