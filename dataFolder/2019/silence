Text: "Total darkness, moist wet surroundings, a smartphone, a DSLR and a headlight\
  \ which supposedly stopped working a year ago.  Looking behind, the tunnel of light\
  \ was closing up till it disappeared with a final twinkle as I move forward. I wonder\
  \ if......\n\nSeeing a curved hard surface, I take a seat and turn of my headlight.\
  \ Pitch black with the silent sound of trickling water and cool air gently swirling\
  \ around caressed my cheeks. I wonder if this is how people in the movie \"The Descent\"\
  \ felt like. Though, I was pretty sure New Zealand did not contain any undiscovered\
  \ cave dwellings, I couldn't help conjuring up all the 1000 ways I could die right\
  \ there. It must have been about one to two minutes of contemplation when I happened\
  \ to tilt my face up. \n\nThere they were. Unexpected but a beautiful surprise.\
  \ Glowworms, emitting their magical blue light as they hung down in their delicate\
  \ threads. After taking a few snaps and admiring them further, I switched on my\
  \ headlight and decided to move further on. After all, couldn't take all day here\
  \ seeing as no one knew where I was and seeing the condition of the path, it would\
  \ be a miracle if I could back to my car before sunset.\n\nAs I continued walking,\
  \ trying not to trip over the small rocks and uneven path, I could hear the trickle\
  \ of water becoming louder. Am I approaching the in-cave waterfall I read about?\
  \ I was feeling apprehensive as I would need to climb the waterfall and was never\
  \ really good at pull-ups to pull myself up.\nAs I walked further in, I had to come\
  \ to a stand still. Clearly, I over imagined how tall three meters is. The water\
  \ fall was about twice my height. All I needed to figure out was how should I go\
  \ about climbing it. To the left, just a steep vertical wall. Below, well I'm not\
  \ dead yet so not going to go in that direction either. To the right, there seemed\
  \ to be like a series of natural footings and grips due to the rough texture of\
  \ the soil and rock blended wall.\n\nI sling'ed my DSLR around my neck and backwards.\
  \ Gripping the wet walls, I tried to put a foot on the wall but slipped. Taking\
  \ a step back, I tried to re-evaluate another route up which will hopefully not\
  \ cause me to crack my head. Seeing another, I tried again. After getting a foothold\
  \ on the rocky texture, I realized that the only way up is to climb horizontally\
  \ before going vertically up. Talk about American Ninja style. Ensuring that my\
  \ fingers are gripping the wall, I sashayed sideways and slowly started to make\
  \ my way up. After forever, I was able to reach the top. I was proud of myself for\
  \ not hyperventilating and showing true grit in this time. It took all of 10 minutes.\n\
  \nAfter taking one final look at the bottom of the cave (which was 3m below), I\
  \ crouched and walked at the same time, till the ceiling space increased. In front,\
  \ appeared a spot of light, like a lone star at night. As I walked, the zone of\
  \ light increased allowing me to see the exit of this walk through cave. Not bad\
  \ for my first completely unprepared solo cave exploration. As I exited the cave,\
  \ I was welcomed by the sun rays shining on my face like a slow motioned Hollywood\
  \ moment.\n\nAhead of me was a forest with trees slumped down, vines growing everywhere\
  \ and a muddy churned up path. Guess another Indiana Jones adventure starts before\
  \ I can get back to my car."
