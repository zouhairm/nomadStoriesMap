Text: "A Short Adventure to Balinese Coffee, Culture and People\n\nBali is a brand,\
  \ It's really easy to get people travel from their sophisticated developed country\
  \ to this other part of the world just to appreciate life and give themselves a\
  \ pleasure to enjoy it. You could named is as a god island, the surfer island, paradise,\
  \ you named it. \n\nFirst time, I do not really up to a coffee job, my first mission\
  \ is just to help with whatever I could help to sell this plaga coffee to specialty\
  \ coffee roaster in Jakarta. As far as I knew, not all people really up to Balinese\
  \ coffee that is also why 2016 crop remain untouched at their warehouse. Also I\
  \ could not fought the nature by just put the blame on them not to have a good harvest\
  \ in 2017 (I took this moment very personal, sorry about it). \nBack to this awkward\
  \ bule, until I decided to work with him and helping him to running his shop. \n\
  \nSeminyak 6th of August 2018 is my very important day since I started to work this\
  \ entire new job as a coffee specialist, here at The Koop Roaster and Caf\xE9. I\
  \ used to roast some coffee, training the team, make up the coffee quality, dealing\
  \ with new kind of international customers, and keep up with it. But still I really\
  \ wanted to be back at the stage of barista competition. While doing my routine,\
  \ I was trying to have myself a time to train my skill and developing some roast\
  \ profile for my coffee, bring back to the competition levels. It was getting really\
  \ deep for me to think about this crappy competition. But first thing first, I have\
  \ to promote this coffee. Then I sent this coffee for such a national cupping competition.\
  \ So what is cupping competition, this is basically competition among coffee farmers\
  \ all around Indonesia, so the farmer or mill owner have to send their coffee to\
  \ specialty coffee association of Indonesia in Jakarta. The association have to\
  \ roast this coffee at the same time with the same roast degree and inviting professional\
  \ Q-Grader (certified Arabica coffee taster and grader) to taste and score every\
  \ coffee that they were cupping during that day. \n\nYes hard work pays off, I sent\
  \ three different kind of processes within the same coffee and all of them ended\
  \ up within top 10. Placed number 4, 6 and 10. This is one of my happiest day in\
  \ my life and also the day when I really learn to remain humble by being the winner.\
  \ For us, this is just the beginning to show that we actually can do better to improve\
  \ our coffee quality, for the entire Indonesian coffee industry and especially Bali.\
  \ \nBack to reality, at the shop I have to work the bar and train the team to get\
  \ them the same understanding so that they could also help us spreading our love\
  \ for Balinese coffee. Most of it, I did really enjoyed roasting this coffee and\
  \ again brewing it with the same manner that I really love to. Form this point I\
  \ wanted to focus on being a coffee roaster, so that I could make a real impact\
  \ and contact to our farmers, not just Bali I guess. \n\nAgain this feeling keep\
  \ pushing me away from my actual position by now. Still I never contented with everything\
  \ I do. My farmer was kind of closed minded person. We could almost do nothing new\
  \ and the community was still so young to do this specialty coffee things in pursuing\
  \ better quality. I felt tired and back myself up to retreat by letting them being\
  \ as what it is by now. Maybe near the future I could help them more by bringing\
  \ more coffee people to make a small change and keep them up at striving and improving\
  \ their coffee quality. But now I knew why god have been showing me this compositions\
  \ before I actually have to do something massive for myself. And I decided to be\
  \ a full time coffee roaster by now. I am striving on it, for the sake of getting\
  \ new connection to another farmers in another island."
