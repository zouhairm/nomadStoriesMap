Text: "As long as I can remember I have always loved the warm weather and despised\
  \ the cold one.  \nThis has ( I will now say unfortunately) influenced for a great\
  \ part of my life ,where and when I went on vacation. \nEverything changed when\
  \ I took a two months long  Estonian language course. \nTo clarify, I study languages\
  \ at the university in Venice and this Estonian language course was offered by my\
  \ university as an extra-curricular activity. \nI was intrigued by this language\
  \ and it seemed an easy and fun course to follow, so I took it. \nNow I can say\
  \ this was a very good decision. The teacher was an ex-student of my university\
  \ and made the course so interesting and captivating , even though the language\
  \ per se is really difficult, and most importantly made us want to visit Estonia.\n\
  Problem was that this language course took place during the months of November and\
  \ December, the holidays  and my final exams were around the corner and it seemed\
  \ like my dream of visiting Estonia would have  remained an unfulfilled one. \n\
  Then  two months later maybe by chance , maybe due to my Google search on Estonia,\
  \ I found it: a really cheap plane ticket and a nice but affordable hotel in Tallinn\
  \ , the capital of Estonia. \nSo one of my friend, that took the language course\
  \ with me, and I booked the flight and the hotel. \nI was so happy that I managed\
  \ to found such a good offer and was so thrilled about the journey that I completely\
  \ forgot that it  was the middle of February. \nFebruary in Estonia is not exactly\
  \ a very sunny month, on the contrary it\u2019s one of the coldest  and darkest\
  \ month of the year. \nThe temperatures can drop far below 0 degrees Celsius, and\
  \ most of the time it snows. \nAfter realizing this I was utterly terrified; what\
  \ did I get myself into?  What if the weather was unbearable during  our entire\
  \ stay? Was there actually something to visit , to do in Tallinn during the winter?\
  \ Would I be miserable the entire trip? \nI put all of this worries aside and trusted\
  \ my first instinct: \u201CMy gut told me to go so I will\u201D I said to myself;\
  \ also the plan tickets were not refundable. \nThe day of the departure came, and\
  \ after three hours of flight there I was in Tallinn.\nIt was absolutely stunning.\
  \ \nTallinn still has its old medieval town, encircled by the medieval city walls\
  \ ,and fortunately our hotel was exactly in the old city. \nSure, it was snowing\
  \ and it was cold but I didn\u2019t care because the scenery was amazing. The snow\
  \ actually added some magic to the old city.  \nAt the beginning of the journey\
  \ I thought that we would have had spent most of our time inside because of the\
  \ weather, and of course we spent some time inside in museums and churches for example,\
  \ but we also strolled around the old city for the most of our stay. \nTallinn is\
  \ also a mix of two cultures: the city is relatively  closed to Saint Petersburg\
  \ so it is still heavily influenced by the Russian culture. Still today a big portion\
  \ of the population is Russian or consider itself Russian. \nFor this reason it\
  \ is possible to see in Tallinn The Alexander Nevsky Cathedral, an orthodox cathedral\
  \ which is something completely different from catholic or protestant cathedral.\
  \ \nTallinn is on the shore of the Gulf of Finland , so it is possible to go to\
  \ Helsinki in Finland by ferry. \nCruising amongst the frozen sea is unbelievable,\
  \ an experience I recommend to everyone. \nBest memory of this journey is me and\
  \ my friend on the seashore, with snow and swans all around us. \nA cold and unexpected\
  \ trip but a special one."
