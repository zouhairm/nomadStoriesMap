Text: "As I landed in New Delhi I understood I was in another planet\u2014where the\
  \ smog swallowed people, and the people resembled stars in the sky\u2014endless\
  \ constellations that took your breath away. I was hyperaware of my minuscule significance\
  \ in the universe while simultaneously understanding that each particle of a person\
  \ contributed to the mass movement of humanity. I had arrived in India\u2014the\
  \ country with a song for a name and silent drums in the wind.\n\nAfter I\u2019\
  d gotten my luggage and my foot stepped between the sliding doors in the New Delhi\
  \ airport to meet my driver\u2014time slowed. There were thousands of people waiting\
  \ behind the rails for their loved ones, late into the night. A low fog hovered\
  \ above their heads. The noises came from everywhere and never went away\u2014they\
  \ were the background noise to every story ever told from India, because India is\
  \ not India without the prayers, the honking, the yelling, and the crying children.\
  \ The noises brought me back to life in a way the quietness found in western airports\
  \ could not. \n\nI arrived in Kolkata three days later with hungry eyes after all\
  \ I\u2019d caught in Delhi. I had an eager desire to learn the crooks and crannies\u2014\
  to master the tricks and turns\u2014to banter with the locals and bargain with the\
  \ market vendors.  I\u2019d seen things I couldn\u2019t unsee\u2014a man selling\
  \ food cross legged on the ground without shoes\u2014sacks full of colorful vegetables\
  \ and lentil beans, saris, gypsy children,  dancers  from Rajasthan in Dilli Haat,\
  \ parakeets, monkeys, and even one of the eight wonders of the world. I\u2019d learned\
  \ more about history in my three days in Delhi than I ever had in any school I\u2019\
  d attended in America. I\u2019d visited a king\u2019s tomb and discovered the essence\
  \ of the word \u201Cancient\u201D in Qutub Minar. If I\u2019d seen and learned that\
  \ much in just three days in Delhi, I couldn\u2019t imagine what awaited for me\
  \ in Kolkata.\n\nMy arrival would be the beginning of a gruesome awakening, one\
  \ that would set the foundation for the start of my adult life. I waited anxiously\
  \ in the Kolkata airport for three hours to retrieve my luggage, and when it finally\
  \ did arrive, I hurried towards the exit\u2014where to my dismay I understood how\
  \ little I had planned for the trip. I hadn\u2019t even gotten my hosts number!\
  \ I had to communicate with her via email, and I had no wi-fi service. I\u2019d\
  \ spend two more hours waiting to get connected to the wi-fi. When I finally had\
  \ a breakthrough I would learn that my peers had been waiting for me right outside\
  \ since early afternoon, and it was after eight in the evening. I ran towards them,\
  \ apologizing profusely as they calmly stared at me as though it was no big deal.\
  \ I later understood it was because every citizen in Calcutta knew that time there\
  \ ran like an old, grandfather clock. It kept busy\u2014it just went at it\u2019\
  s own pace. It was after all, one of the oldest literary cities in the world."
