Text: "Hitchhikers are the epitome of stranger danger. This lesson was drilled into\
  \ my brain growing up, so how my brother and I ended up picking up hitchhikers in\
  \ a foreign country is beyond me.\n\nFace warm with embarrassment, I turn to my\
  \ brother to make an overdue admission.\n\n\u201CI didn\u2019t expect Iceland to\
  \ be quite so icy.\u201D \n\nWalking back toward our car, we\u2019re in the midst\
  \ of a Glacier. It\u2019s re-treating as if previously informed that Iceland shouldn\u2019\
  t be so icy. Enormous chunks of ice have broken free, melted and slowly produced\
  \ the jaw-dropping J\xF6kuls\xE1rl\xF3n Glacial Lagoon. Salty sea water mixes with\
  \ fresh glacial water to create remarkable shades from blue-to-green and white-to-black\
  \ amongst the icebergs jutting from the lagoon. \n\n\u201CIt was your idea to come\
  \ to Iceland in November\u201D\n\nI admit it was a silly thought, but I had done\
  \ my research! Previous winters hadn\u2019t been quite as freezing and icy compared\
  \ to our current experience. \n\n\u201CWhoa!\u201D\n\nTwo kids bundled for the weather.\
  \ Snow pants, winter coat, hat, mittens and rolling luggage? Holding a sign for\
  \ Reykjavik.\n\nBoth our necks crank to the left as we pass them crossing the short\
  \ bridge to Diamond Beach. My mind is racing. Are they in trouble? What could have\
  \ happened to them? We are heading for Reykjavik.\n\n\u201CIf they\u2019re still\
  \ there when we\u2019re leaving, then we will stop and ask what\u2019s going on.\u201D\
  \n\nDiamond Beach sparkles from yards away. A childish joy washes over us as we\
  \ explore the black sand beach peppered in ice chunks of all shapes and sizes. It\u2019\
  s 10:00 A.M. and the sun is trying to rise. Iceland\u2019s high latitude stunts\
  \ the daylight length in the winter, and we experience the beauty of the golden\
  \ hour for most of the day. As the rising sun glistens across a piece of ice comically\
  \ shaped as an oversized diamond, my brother notices and heaves it up with both\
  \ hands. He gets down on one knee and requests a picture as a mock proposal to his\
  \ girlfriend. We\u2019re laughing as we head back to the car. \n\nThey crossed the\
  \ bridge. We will pass right by them, again. My brother stops.\n\n\u201CHey. What\u2019\
  s going on? Are you okay?\u201D\n\n\u201CWe need a ride to Reykjavik. We can help\
  \ with gas, but we can't afford bus fare. Please help us\u2026\u201D \n\nThey are\
  \ so young. It\u2019s freezing. The roads are barren.  \n\n\u201CWe are heading\
  \ to Reykjavik, but we have a full day of sightseeing planned. You\u2019ll have\
  \ to join.\u201D\n\n\u201COf course! We\u2019d be very grateful!\u201D\n\nWe pause.\
  \ We share a look. We shrug. My brother unlocks the door.\n\n\u201CWell, if you\
  \ don\u2019t mind squeezing in the backseat, we do have space.\u201D\n\nAnnette\
  \ and William are from Estonia, yet adventure-seekers just the same as us. Similar\
  \ in terrain to Minnesota, we also shared a commonality of growing up spending time\
  \ outside near lakes, greenery and open spaces. We laughed as we realized we all\
  \ learned English the same way \u2013 watching Cartoon Network. \n\n\u201CLook,\
  \ there is the dog!\u201D \n\nI am excited that the hike to Seljavallalaug will\
  \ be the first sightseeing stop new to all of us. I amped up the adventure by describing\
  \ the black lab that would be waiting to guide us to the pool. They hadn\u2019t\
  \ believed me. \n\n\u201CDon\u2019t forget to grab your swimsuit!\u201D \n\nFollowing\
  \ the tracks between the valley, we begin our trek to the pool. The sun embarks\
  \ on its lengthy path to setting behind the mountains and we admire the serenity\
  \ surrounding us. An overrun from the hot spring stops us. We reach down to feel\
  \ the warm water, but are careful to navigate a crossing that keeps our boots dry.\
  \ Finally, the pool comes into view. \n\nThe green dressing rooms are damp and cold.\
  \ Seljavallalaug is the oldest pool in Iceland. Despite being fed from a natural\
  \ hot spring, it may also be the coldest. Maybe it's just this winter. Our new friends\
  \ laugh as they elect to watch us shiver through our swim rather than joining.\n\
  \n\nThe night sky embraces us as we finally spot signs for Reykjavik. A relieved,\
  \ but somber tone falls over the car as we realized our adventure together is coming\
  \ to an end."
