Text: "The journey began from the \u201CGod's own country\u201D in India and ended\
  \ in the \u201Cland of Midnight sun\u201D amidst the fjord where Vikings sailed,\
  \ and one of the most compassionate individuals on this earth live. Norway Being\
  \ my first ever venture out of India I had my shares of doubt about the whole trip\
  \ I planned across Europe, but it turned out to be the most memorable one.\nFirst\
  \ destination, Germany. My best experience was Octoberfest in Munich. People dressed\
  \ in traditional Bavarian outfits filled the place \u2014 hundreds of people waiting\
  \ outside around 14 huge tents. After half an hour of pleading to security, I got\
  \ an entry. Freshly Brewed German beer, central orchestra, and crazy people. A full\
  \ day of dancing and drinking, unforgettable experience for me.\nSecond destination,\
  \ Spain. Gaudi\u2019s architecture in Barcelona and the city\u2019s party scene\
  \ was enough for my satisfaction, but sky diving in Seville became one of the most\
  \ memorable parts of my life. The adrenaline rush kicked as I walked to the Dornier\
  \ G92 Aircraft and watched all others sitting in front of me jumping one by one\
  \ from 15000 ft. I was terrified, but the free-fall for 1 minute, the descent from\
  \ the sky to the earth, the beautiful infinite landscape, flying above green and\
  \ brown patches of land and minuscule buildings, I wished to be a bird in next life.\n\
  Third Destination, Portugal. I had a short stay there, but one long-lasting association\
  \ with Portugal came in the form of water surfing, which became my all-time favorite\
  \ instantly. Henceforth, I tried to go for water surfing in all the beach places.\
  \ The good cheap food was another attraction of Portugal, being from a country where\
  \ we love spicy food, eating sandwiches gave me cravings only satisfied in this\
  \ place.\nFourth destination, Crete, Greece. I went there to attend a writing workshop\
  \ and had a long stay in the Chania, a city in Crete. I missed the visits to historical\
  \ places in Greece, but I met Greek gods, Hades and Olympus. Those two were the\
  \ main characters of the final submission of my writing piece. We sat with wines\
  \ and olives to do our writings on the edge of the sea, the best days of my whole\
  \ journey.\nFifth Destination, Budapest, Hungary. The craziest parties I attended\
  \ in all of Europe. The ruin pubs of the city and people drinking all night to get\
  \ up and drink again. Although I planned to go for the famous thermal bath in the\
  \ town, at the end of the trip, I needed it.\nSixth Destination, Italy. I started\
  \ my journey from Riomaggiore; the place was stunningly beautiful. I was utterly\
  \ surprised by the architectural marvel of this place, so close to the sea and a\
  \ railway station underneath. My journey ahead was more historical and monumental.\
  \ I traveled further to see the leaning tower of PISA, then went to Rome to see\
  \ the mighty Colosseum and the Vatican empire. From there I headed back to Venice\
  \ to witness the highest high tide since 2008 and roamed around the city in knee-deep\
  \ water with most of the public transport being closed. As crazy as it could go.\n\
  Ninth and Tenth destinations, Croatia and Prague. Take away from Croatia was the\
  \ Plitvice lakes, another mesmerizing place I visited in Europe. Prague was the\
  \ week of Halloween, I attended a party named \u201CSexy Halloween Party,\u201D\
  \ what else I should say. And the cravings for Indian food took me to Lal Quila\
  \ restaurant, the best Indian meal I had in Europe.\nFinal destination, Norway.\
  \ There are so many good things to describe in this wonder. The beautiful city of\
  \ Bergen and it\u2019s fish market for food cravings, never enough OSLO\u2019s nightlife,\
  \ the thrill of trekking to Trolltunga, living paradise in the northern lights,\
  \ watching the strongest tidal current in the world and the snow-covered roads to\
  \ walk in subzero-temperature were few to mention.\nThe memories, experience, and\
  \ learning from the people I met and the places I visited will stay with me forever.\
  \ My love for travel has increased manifold, and I have learned the traveler\u2019\
  s way to visit places."
