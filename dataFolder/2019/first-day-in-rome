Text: "Mama mia, Roma! \n\nThat isn't as cliche as one might think. The Italian speakers\
  \ of Rome do say it here. Mama mia, bello, e fantastico. Ah, alberi! Those clouds\
  \ of evergreen aloft a twining, threadlike mandrel. That anything so fae-like could\
  \ endure the trample of the 21st century is something shattering. They're called\
  \ stone pines, these trees. But no, that isn't what they are at all. \n\nRome is\
  \ like that. Every winding road (and there are a lot of those) seems to lead to\
  \ another marvel of antiquity, and the beauty of it pierces you right in your bones.\
  \ It is a feeling that words cannot convey. Today we spent four bone-splintering,\
  \ heart-perforating hours in Il Colosseo e il Palitino. We relinquished our lives\
  \ out there in the ruins. I died there. Die, I say, because there is no word in\
  \ the English language befit to describe the relics we saw. There is no word in\
  \ any language that comes close to illuminating what it is to look about you and\
  \ see those brumes of foliage, to run your hands over three thousand-year-old limestone.\
  \ Your soul departs in these moments. Your heart and soul fly away, and you're left\
  \ like a carapace on the cobblestone until breath finds you again."
