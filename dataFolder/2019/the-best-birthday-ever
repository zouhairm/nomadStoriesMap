Text: "In November 2017 I spent almost a year collecting money to travel celebrating\
  \ my birthday and my sister\xB4s. We went to Foz do Igu\xE7u in Brazil with lots\
  \ of plans for our schedule, including the tour to the Falls. I had never seen anything\
  \ so magnicent and in that moment I was speechless. while the waters fell I could\
  \ feel the positive energy transmited. It was if the water led us to a calm and\
  \ unknown place never seen before.\n   We also visited the Argentina falls because\
  \ Brazil and Argentina shered this natural wonder, by the way it is impossible to\
  \ say each one is more beautiful, therefore both of than gave to us the amazing\
  \ feeling of peace. As if it was a kind of terapy to relax and forget the problems.\n\
  \    We made friend with some tourists and natives, sharing a little of our culture\
  \ and learning theirs. This moment was so important because we gave to each other\
  \ some suggestins of places to visit in there.\n   The culinary is a bit different\
  \ from mine, but the taste is divine. We ate exocts dishes to enrich our palate\
  \ and I miss some of them.\n   In that unfogettable city, people are very polite\
  \ and teh streeat cleaning was the first detail that impressed me, and won my first\
  \ complement. The hotel was very sofisticated and confortable, but the most important\
  \ is the value so cheap, not only accommodation but also the restaurants, gifts\
  \ shops, places to visit wicth we have to pay to the tickets, like Wax Museum or\
  \ the birds park. This kind of place gives to our eyes something to be always remembered\
  \ and shered, because this experience can change someone\xB4s life\xB4.\n    Even\
  \ today we laughh at the fanny momens that happend along the trip. I will never\
  \ forget this."
