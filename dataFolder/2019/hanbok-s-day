Text: "Last year I decided to visit a different place, somewhere that would expand\
  \ my view and my horizons, far away of everywhere that I have ever visited before.\
  \ For this adventure I chose South Korea, also the place where I did my University\
  \ Exchange Program. When I arrived, I expected a different reception, in a country\
  \ totally different of mine, with an alphabet that I didn\u2019t know, and without\
  \ speak anything, except Annyeonghaseyo, which means hi, a compliment. However,\
  \ everyone was super friendly with me, from the airport to the flight back. Despite\
  \ the fact that many people don\u2019t know English, mainly the elders, they tried\
  \ help me in everything. \nIn spite of the language problems a had to face other\
  \ dilemma, as the food, I never taste nothing so spice before, everything I ate\
  \ resulted in the same feeling: each bite one tear. Thankfully I made friends that\
  \ appreciated another kind of food too, and advise me about non-spice food, which\
  \ one I should eat. Friends are important in this kind of adventure, if they are\
  \ local, they are able to help you and if they are not, they can live adventures\
  \ with you. \nOne of the most memorable day was the hanbok day. Hanbok are traditional\
  \ Korean clothes, costumes worn on formal occasions, it is based on Joseon Dynasty\
  \ clothes, however it underwent practical changes in the twentieth century, tourist\
  \ and Korean people wear hanbok to visit historical places, as Changdeokgung Palace\
  \ and Huwon, Gyeongbokgung Palace and Bukchon Hanok Village. \nIn the middle of\
  \ fall, me and my friends decided to dress hanbok before the weather got colder.\
  \ We went to the Changdeokgung Palace and Huwon ticket office and bought two tickets\
  \ each, one for the palace and other to Secret Gardens, one of the most beautiful\
  \ places that I\u2019ve ever been. After renting the hanbok we were informed that\
  \ visitors don\u2019t need tickets to the palace when they are wearing hanbok, so\
  \ we tried change the tickets and get our money back. Fortunately, we could get\
  \ the money (only 3,000 Korean Won). The palace complex has a guided tour in English,\
  \ and it is mandatory to visit the Secret Gardens. Due to our numerous stops to\
  \ take pictures we were late to return the hanbok, then, we ran a little to arrive\
  \ in the exit in the right time and render it.\nAfter that, we were hungry (at least\
  \ I was!) and we started to look for a rice cake cafe, however, afterward walking\
  \ in circles someone told us that the place was closed. At this time another friend\
  \ indicates a cafe in Insadong, a commercial neighborhood supposedly nearby the\
  \ palace the palace. It wasn\u2019t exactly nearby, because we needed to walk a\
  \ little, too much for short legs. We ate a \u201Cpoo cake\u201D (a chocolate cake\
  \ with poo shape) in Insadong main street and went to a teahouse, finally ate our\
  \ rice cake accompanied by tea and bingsu (scraped ice with sweet toppings), and\
  \ the tea was wonderful. Koran rice cake is a dessert, and unlike the Japanese rice\
  \ cake, which is salty. After enjoying our sweet meal and wanting something salty\
  \ for dinner, we begun looking for it, so we move to Sinchon, where my friend knows\
  \ a good bulgogi restaurant, the famous Korean barbecue. I never tried it before,\
  \ and they strictly recommended it. Now, me too! The staff at the restaurant were\
  \ very friendly, specially with my friend, she went there several times and we received\
  \ free Cola, in view of she was returning with new clients. \nSubsequently, we were\
  \ walking around the neighborhood when a group of Korean girls stopped us and asked\
  \ about our beliefs and how we classify family, friends, boyfriends/girlfriends\
  \ and God, in view of they were writing a book, and suddenly we were discussing\
  \ the differences among our societies and our preferences. We needed to stop the\
  \ conversation, due to the hour and the rain, but it was a nice and random conversation.\
  \ \nI wrote about this day whereas I think that resumes my days in Korea, nice friends,\
  \ beautiful sightseeing and wonderful natives. Korea is definitely a country that\
  \ I want to come back."
