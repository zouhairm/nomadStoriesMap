Text: "When I started traveling I didn\u2019t mean anything serious, it was just to\
  \ get my away from the chronic depression which was affecting my existence, after\
  \ my husband left me alone with our new born son. What I didn\u2019t know was, there\
  \ was a completely different world waiting to embrace me, or rather, for me to embrace\
  \ it back. I took my 23 month young son on a trip to Vietnam, just us two, into\
  \ the unknown, changing two flights and the moment we landed I instantly felt a\
  \ connection and knew that I was meant to be there. Nothing on earth felt more earth\
  \ than that moment, where Hanoi was waiting for me to nourish my empty soul and\
  \ feed me with the of the most delictable cuisine I have tasted. Vietnam is not\
  \ shrouded in mystery unlike some South East Asian countries, it bares it heart\
  \ out for any traveller to see, a country ravaged by war not very long ago, but\
  \ proudly progressing ahead into the future, leaving the past behind. \nThe Vietnamese\
  \ are one of the kindest, sweetest and helpful people I have come across in my many\
  \ travels. Everywhere we go they will simply offer to hold my son and let me enjoy\
  \ my meals in peace, however when I look around  they will be busy feeding my toddler\
  \ with simple rice and chicken soup, even by a man, and that is so touching, I can\u2019\
  t even explain it, I silently had to wipe of my tears each time. A little boy whose\
  \ father abandoned but accepted by strangers thousands of miles away in an unknown\
  \ country, that can happen only in Vietnam. It is not very easy for a single mother\
  \ to take several luggages, a baby\u2019s strollers and several handbags and hop\
  \ countries, not Herculean task either. But the Vietnamese saw it and make it so\
  \ much easy for me, will help me in every possible way they can. This very country\
  \ is the one that have filled up my wounded soul and it\u2019s slowly starting to\
  \ heal and made me fall so much in love with the pele that I have promised myself\
  \ and my son that we shall be back soon, again. I will never give up on my dreams\
  \ of traveling the world, raising awareness about different social issues in the\
  \ society as I travel and explore the ways of the people on different societies\
  \ around the world. The passion for travel is not simply about visiting new places\
  \ and clicking pictures, it\u2019s about living in real time in the places we are\
  \ in and experiencing the real Dee rooted culture, food, listening to the locals\
  \ about the hardship they endure, what makes them happy and listen to them about\
  \ the ongoing social issues they are facing and their opinions about those issues.\
  \ It emits warmth, bring in more passion and increases love- to tell real stories\
  \ or real people."
