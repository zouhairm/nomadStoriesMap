  \ Nothing could be further from the truth! I have so much to tell you. First of\
  \ all, get to know the locals! Don't speak French!? Use Google translate. I literally\
  \ had a French boyfriend for a few days who wanted to come back with me and we spoke\
  \ through the app the whole time. Honestly, it was probably the best relationship\
  \ I ever had! \U0001F602\U0001F923 I met my French lover at a bar close to the hotel\
  \ I stayed in. And boy did he show me around. I mean, Nice has everything, amazing\
  \ coastlines that give the Amalfi coast a run for their money! It also board a cool\
  \ nightlife, I may or may not have accidentally ordered two extremely expensive\
  \ bottles of Rose champagne. Boy was that a surprise to wake up to when I checked\
  \ my bank statements in the morning! Lol Good thing the owner liked me and refunded\
  \ my money for the lady one, apparently our whole group left after we were only\
  \ there a few minutes to go to another club and didn't drink it! Hahaha. Oh did\
  \ I mention my two day lover was a DJ!? He showed me what he was known for that\
  \ night in many different ways! The next day we went to the beach, and can I just\
  \ say it's the best beach I've ever seen in my life. Perfect tropical blue water\
  \ and blue and white striped sunshades that line the beachchairs. There were beautiful\
  \ girls topless in the water, they must have been models from the Cannes film festival\
  \ bc they were absolutely stunning. Locals were extremely friendly when I asked\
  \ for directions, and they have cool little buggies that you can rent for next to\
  \ nothing and they peddle you around in if you don't feel like walking. And don't\
  \ even get me started on the shopping, are you kidding me? French fashion is above\
  \ par. I picked up so many classy hats, one for the beach, one for church, and I\
  \ even picked one up for my ex husbands funeral! Haha. I'll wait as long as it takes!\
  \ I plan ahead haha. But I honestly didn't plan anything on this Vacation because\
  \ I didn't have to! The one thing I will say is that it's  extremely crowded in\
  \ the shopping district, people will seriously run into you and you couldn't  even\
  \ make your way  around a store without everyone in your way, the lines are long\
  \ to check  out. To make it worse,  a lady cut in front  of me while I was waiting\
  \ to pay for my hats and right  when I thought I'd totally cuss her out but she\
  \ wouldn't  understand me...shd invited I kid you not, 5 more people over who also\
  \ got in line with her in front of me. How rude! I certainly hope  that's not  how\
  \ all French  people act in shopping situations! But at least I got to see gorgeous\
  \ old buildings and buy street art while I was there. With its Baroque-style palaces\
  \ and churches, and narrow streets you will never forget it  I visited an insanely\
  \ old church that looked like it was from a fairy tale. The Basilica of Notre-Dame\
  \ de Nice is a Roman Catholic church in Neo-Gothic style. The lights they have on\
  \ it at night make it a sight  to behold. I took a photo by a classic baby blue\
  \ Rolls Royce. Absolute perfection of a car. I ate lobster, I drank champagne, but\
  \ I also did the tourisy thing by taking pictures in the famous \"I love nice\"\
  \ letters, sitting inside the big O. The history and culture is everywhere your\
  \ eye can see, people air drying their laundry on the tiered historical buildings,\
  \ the Apollo statue that crowns the fountain at Place Massena. Side note, the street\
  \ pizza was delicious. I sang kareoke with a live band. I fucked like a champion.\
  \ I lived, loved, and surfed that wave. Nice is hands down the most favorite place\
  \ I've visited so far, and boy does it live up to it's name. Nice isn't just nice,\
  \ its heaven on earth."
