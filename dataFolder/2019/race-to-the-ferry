Text: "As I snailed my way through an island path near Onomichi, Japan, I experienced\
  \ a completely new feeling.  Vehicle envy.  I had set out on this mission with my\
  \ newly formed friend from Honk Kong.  We had rented regular run-of-the-mill bicycles.\
  \  These bikes had been splendid for the first hour of our journey, but as native\
  \ Japanese tourists sped past us on classy mountain bicycles, I began to question\
  \ the suitability of my ride.  When I had remounted after lunch, my legs were quick\
  \ to remind me that I had hardly even biked around the block in the last 10 or 15\
  \ years.  Yet here I was, committed to biking across three small islands before\
  \ sunset when the last ferry would take us to shore.\n\nAnother two hours in, my\
  \ poor friend paused at the top of the hill.  I panted as I dragged my bike up to\
  \ her.  \u201CHey,\u201D she said.  \u201CLet\u2019s take a look at the map.\u201D\
  \ She proceeded to pull it out of her bag.  There was a blue and a red line marking\
  \ the trails.  We had taken the blue trail.  This was under the recommendation of\
  \ the man who rented the bikes to us.  We both felt dismay settling in as we looked\
  \ at the time and then looked at the remaining path.\n\n \u201CI don\u2019t\u2019\
  \ think we are going to make it.\u201D She said. \n\nI gazed out over the beautiful\
  \ landscape for a moment. \u201CWell,\u201D I hesitated, \u201CI know you are faster.\
  \  You can go ahead, and I can stay overnight somewhere\u2026I guess.\u201D   In\
  \ my head, however, I was screaming \u201CDON\u2019T LEAVE!\u201D \n\nAs we paused\
  \ weighing the situation a moment longer, I pointed to the ominous looking red line.\
  \ My mind was quietly screaming, \u201Cdanger\u201D but my eyes clearly confirmed\
  \ that the path, harder or easier, was at least shorter.  Although this was a tourist\
  \ map, it was only written in Japanese.  Japanese uses three scripts. Fortunately,\
  \ one of those scripts is Chinese characters and my Hong Kong friend could read\
  \ it.  \n\n\u201COh!\u201D she exclaimed. \n\n\u201CWhat?\u201D\n\nShe pointed to\
  \ the writing, \u201CThis blue line we have been following is the advanced biker\
  \ route.  The red one is the beginner trail.\u201D\n\n\u201CWhat?\u201D  I was floored.\
  \  No wonder there were so many mountainous hills and beautiful views.  And no wonder\
  \ that my inexperienced legs felt like melted jelly.\n\nShe smiled.  \u201CI guess\
  \ we can make it after all. We just need to turn right instead of left at the T.\u201D\
  \ She hopped on her bike and I followed her on the path which was mercifully downhill."
