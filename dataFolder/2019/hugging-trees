Text: "I moved to Argentina in 2018 I was looking for culture, art, actors, dancers,museums,\
  \ paintings, buildings, old italian structures, something to fulfill my personality,\
  \ after 2 months of living in Buenos Aires this huge city that never sleep, it was\
  \ the G20 event where all square  of microcenter is closed by police because Government\
  \ especially presidents from different countries visit Buenos Aires with their wifes,\
  \ in this moment I was renting a room in the center where was this event, so to\
  \ avoid this, I came at 6 am to my place very early in the morning after an agentinian\
  \ girl friend  that I met in tango classes, invite me to a Milonga, this place where\
  \ hundreds of persons from all over the world came to Argentina for improve their\
  \ tango skills, its quite amazing, while in this big dance saloon people were talking\
  \ about the wonderful trees that are called borrachos like little drunks in Spanish,\
  \ so I said I saw them,  but I haven't observe it nearer to it, when I return, there\
  \ was nobody on the street, looked like the after invasion of zombies, just 5 men\
  \ with their green custome and bats asking where was I staying, I had to pass through\
  \ them, my rent room was in the heart center of Buenos Aires, I was to exhausted\
  \ after 2 months learning and dancing tango everyday and every night, not stopping,\
  \ so \nAfter the police corroborate that I live close that place he finally let\
  \ me in, a friend called me in the meanwhile, I  met him in San Pedro de Atacama\
  \ when I was tour guiding tourists in the desert, he is an Argentinian musician\
  \ that plays in an indiginous group in the north of Chile, my beautiful country,\
  \ he talked, hey where are you? I came to visit my family and I knew that you are\
  \ living here let's meet now, I told him about G20 and that I was staying in the\
  \ middle , he said wait for me, I'm caming to save you ( no one was there) except\
  \ me and this green cops) , I was remember our story in the desert while I was waiting\
  \ for him, he actually save me once I was lost in the desert, first time that I\
  \ walked in this amazing place, he told me I'm a musician of this famous group of\
  \ indiginous musicians do you know it?  Of course they are really good, they makes\
  \ you jump and dance with that music, I saw his green and big eyes, so magic, he\
  \ invites me to his place so I could find my address , we were close, we kissed\
  \ and I told him  I wanted to live in Buenos Aires and bad because I'm a  dancer\
  \ but I must work in my tourism carreer for save money and follow my passion, he\
  \ said when you will be there I'm going to save you again,starting to laugh and\
  \ well he did it. \nWe encounter, I told the cops he is my fiance so he lets him\
  \ pass as well, when he came he broughts me fruits for my breakfast, he teaches\

  \ to hug them with you, we make a promise, even if we are so far, and doing things\
  \ in different places, we'll meet everytime that we can in this place and we will\

  \ remember my friend and his big green eyes dancing a song for me just to make me\
  \ laugh.\n\nPaula Ignacia Marchant Sandoval."
