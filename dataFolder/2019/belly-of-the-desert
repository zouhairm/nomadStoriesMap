Text: "The city is vibrating with energy. Cars advance quickly towards pedestrian\
  \ crosswalks; heavy exhaust fills the air. Elderly men dressed in earth-colored\
  \ garments sit in cafes, smoking and looking out into the streets. As I pass by,\
  \ they glance at me. Their faces are somber, but their eyes are curious with this\
  \ female traveler and her scarlet lips. In the old city, men call out to me from\
  \ shops that brim with soaps and spices. One shop has neat rows of handbags. The\
  \ owner is friendly and introduces himself as Hakeem. \u201CTea?\u201D he asks,\
  \ it is the customary practice when beginning a transaction. I nod, and he motions\
  \ for me to sit on a red plastic stool. When Hakeem returns with tea, he begins\
  \ to massage my shoulders and leans in to kiss me. I stand up, and escape to the\
  \ streets, losing myself in the maze-like alleys where tired donkeys and their fruit-laden\
  \ carts rest against terracotta walls.\n\nThe intoxicating bustle of Marrakesh has\
  \ become overwhelming. The Sahara Desert is calling my name. Someone tells me it\
  \ will take two nights to get there, and if I arrive at the Medina by 7 am I will\
  \ get a discounted tour.\n\nThe large outdoor square is but a frail ghost of the\
  \ night before. In place of the Gypsies who assaulted my arm with henna, the throngs\
  \ of people that circled the snake charmers, musicians and tricksters; and the banter\
  \ of young boys coaxing me to dine at their outdoor restaurants - sit two lone vans\
  \ and a handful of men. I am anxious but hopeful.\n\n\u201CSahara?\u201D The driver\
  \ gestures me towards his van, and I climb into the front seat. \n\nMy travel mates\
  \ are two sisters from Germany, a young couple from China, three American men in\
  \ their early thirties, and myself - the Canadian. I am unsure of what I have gotten\
  \ myself into, trusting the words of a driver I have met only moments earlier.\n\
  \nWe are on the road, and time is passing. We exchange travel stories and giggle\
  \ like old friends. One of the Americans has purchased fresh dates and nuts from\
  \ a street vendor. He shares them with us. Over the next two days, we haggle over\
  \ baby camel rugs, drink sweet Moroccan tea, and dine on overpriced tagine. We stop\
  \ to purchase trinkets we will never use, and buy scarves to tie around our heads.\n\
  \nFinally, the seemingly endless road merges into a horizon of shimmering golden\
  \ powder. Before us lies the great Sahara Desert.\n\nWe tumble excitedly from the\
  \ van. A vision dances within our heads - we are perched upon camels, riding into\
  \ the Sahara sunset. We agree it is a necessary component to our desert experience.\
  \ But the sun is creeping down, and the camels are nowhere in sight.\n\n\u201CWhere\
  \ are our camels?\u201D we demand.\n\n\u201CWe are going to take the 4x4 to meet\
  \ them,\u201D the desert boy replies warily. He glances at our long faces. \u201C\
  Trust me,\u201D he says. This is better.\u201D Disgruntled, we climb onto the roof\
  \ of the SUV. Our legs dangle precariously over its edge.\n\nThe jeep begins to\
  \ move. As it picks up speed, our bodies jostle against each other.  Our eyes are\
  \ wide and our bodies tense. Mountains of sand rise around us, sandy waves dance\
  \ beneath us. An exhilarated shriek escapes my lips. It synchronizes with the euphoric\
  \ cries of my new friends. Up and down we race across the desert dunes. With both\
  \ hands, we grip the thin metal rack with fear. Dusk races to meet us as mother\
  \ desert swallows us whole.\n\nMy heart is pounding as the jeep crawls to a stop.\
  \ I release my white-knuckled grip of the rack and smooth my tousled, windswept\
  \ hair. As I catch my breath, I see them. A magnificent row of hump-backed creatures,\
  \ gracefully making their way across the desert. They are a brilliant picture stretching\
  \ across the sand, their gangly legs moving in unison. We watch in awe, sitting\
  \ from the only vantage point that can truly capture this experience. Like ghosts,\
  \ the mystical creatures and their human passengers disappear back into the Sahara."
