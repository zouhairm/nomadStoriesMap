Text: "'If you blink, that red witch of a desert will eat you alive.'\n\nThe thought\
  \ nagged at me as we waded through the sands of Wadi Rum. The last lights of the\
  \ Bedouin camp stirred uneasily and vanished behind us. Stiff cliffs rose around\
  \ our little trio, but they had lost the rosy-red hue from the day before. The landscape\
  \ no longer seemed worthy of a Star Wars movie. Yet the approaching midnight hour\
  \ and several hookah smokes had us exhilarated and anxious to explore more. We looked\
  \ like a veritable UN mini-assembly comprised of one dancing Indian, one joking\
  \ Uzbek and one slightly scared Bulgarian. Unfortunately, I got to be the Bulgarian\
  \ \u2013 a girl wrapped in baggy clothes that unsuccessfully mimicked the traditional\
  \ attire of the Jordanian Bedouin tribe.\n\nGuided by a smartphone flashlight, we\
  \ were traversing what were essentially the outskirts of the most famous desert\
  \ in Jordan. Without a clue where it would lead us, we trailed off into the darkness\
  \ in single file. We strained our ears to catch any sound of a nervous animal \u2013\
  \ perhaps a wandering camel or an Agama lizard whose beauty sleep we had disturbed.\
  \ There was nothing, though, nothing but a ringing silence that hid in the myriad\
  \ crevices of the rocks.\n\nI gazed longingly back over my shoulder at the lost\
  \ camp. I smelt and felt it all: the perfectly symmetrical red carpets on the floors\
  \ and walls, the polished smiles of the locals, the stinging smell of mint tea and\
  \ the amateur dance moves that we had attempted. The walls of the tent would be\
  \ blowing in the dusty wind while the giant fireplace would give off a fierce warmth\
  \ to the small group of foreigners huddled around it.\n\nWhen my senses returned\
  \ to the unknown path, I was awoken by the flash of numerous eyes in the darkness.\
  \ They danced and flickered around us until we were able to recognise the headlights\
  \ of border patrol jeeps. \n\n\u2018Bad luck for the I-forgot-my-passport gang\u2019\
  , my Indian friend muttered in my ear. I shuddered \u2013 we were identity-less,\
  \ having left our wallets in the camp. Certainly the scorpions would not need to\
  \ check our visas before stinging us.\n\nThrough the jeep windows, however, we spotted\
  \ the laughing faces of our friends from the camp who beckoned us to hop on. We\
  \ were more than happy to oblige. And as the jeeps slid through the dust-swept path,\
  \ I caught a shaky movement in the corner of my eye and turned to stare through\
  \ the window. What I saw was big, no, way too big... a giant snake that slithered\
  \ away only meters from where our trio had been prancing around moments before.\n\
  \nThe border patrol cars pulled up near a booming bonfire where shadowy figures\
  \ had gathered in a magic circle. We descended from the steep jeeps and shook hands\
  \ with the leader of what appeared to be a small Bedouin tribe. In simple English\
  \ he asked that each of us tell a story from their homeland. \u2018Then we will\
  \ set you free\u2019, he joked. \n\nWe plunged into the realm of Scheherazade as\
  \ we discovered that our words were different, but our worlds were the same. We\
  \ laughed and sighed together, not always understanding our sentences but always\
  \ catching the meaning behind them. Sure, the characters were strangers, the events\
  \ were oftentimes ridiculous, but the moral was always the same: the simple truth\
  \ of being human.  \n\nAs dawn winked in the sky, the Bedouins kept their promise\
  \ and set us free. The jeeps drifted away after we had offered our mispronounced\
  \ \u2018shukran\u2019 (thank you). The tribesmen did not wave back, but their smiles\
  \ warmed us on the journey home.\n\nIn the hazy morning, the desert no longer seemed\
  \ like a raging red witch. She was fiery in her hues, but she was also fragile in\
  \ her beauty. It gladdened me to know that we had left nothing but small footsteps\
  \ and small words in that alien land; to know that tomorrow the wind would sweep\
  \ away all traces of us and leave a pristine and secretive parchment for the next\
  \ group of mortal travelers."
