Text: "\"Is that snow?\" I remember asking Adi, as we hurriedly found our way into\
  \ the cafe, trying to hold onto any warmth.\n\n\"No...no, it's like rain but harder.\
  \ What do you call that in English?\" casually replied Adi who seemed to be engulfed\
  \ in his regret of choice of clothing.  \n\n\"Hail stones? So it's hailing.\" said\
  \ I, apprehensively, as I earnestly stared through the window and asked again \"\
  but are you sure that it is not snow?\"\n\nAdi was not paying attention. He had\
  \ found solace in his te de coca and its valiant attempt to ward of the cold that\
  \ was stubbornly clinging to our bodies. \n\nThe idea of snow was always reserved\
  \ for the American movies I watched growing up. The closest I had ever come to experiencing\
  \ a snow day was from the bottom of the Drakensburg mountains, looking up. This\
  \ was no Drakensburg mountain though. This was Chimborazo - one of Ecuador's famous\
  \ volcanoes. Maybe it was just hailing and the altitude finally captured all my\
  \ senses.\n\nChimborazo was the third volcano Ecuador introduced to me. Fixed on\
  \ the outer borders of Riobamba, it is this town's main attraction that calls out\
  \ to all avid hikers and inquisitive tourists. It proudly brags to be the world's\
  \ furthest point from peak to the earth's center.  \n\n5000m above sea level, that's\
  \ quite a feat for an inquisitive tourist like myself I thought, as I reached the\
  \ end of my te de coca and motioned to Adi that we should head out and give this\
  \ volcano a proper snoop around. Standing at the doorway, Adi smiled and nonchalantly\
  \ said \"Look No', I guess you were right, it wasn't hail after all and actual snow\"\
  . It was snowing and my entire being could not fully comprehend the events that\
  \ were taking place before me. I stood statue still as the realization swept through\
  \ me that I honestly did not know what to do when it snowed. This was not a drill\
  \ or a joke, this was my reality. An actual snow day that decided being constricted\
  \ to Christmas movies in my memories was not good enough. Shock and unsolicited\
  \ joy raced through me as I bravely took my first steps into this spontaneous winter\
  \ landscape that had set itself up. Winter had come and I was not ready. The scene\
  \ that was before me saw the white snow take hostage of every surface within its\
  \ reach. It was a surreal set of images that permanently marked itself in my memory.\
  \ \n\nEcuador literally lies on the equator and the equator is infamous for being\
  \ an extremely hot region. My ignorance reserved cold weather and snow days for\
  \ countries like Canada and Switzerland. When the plan to explore Riobamba and adventure\
  \ up Chimborazo presented itself to me, I expected breathtaking views of the surrounding\
  \ landscape and altitude sickness. \n\nI valiantly took a major L in a snow fight\
  \ and clumsily tried to build a snow man. It was pure bliss until the cold robbed\
  \ my face and hands of feeling. The realization that snow was better reserved for\
  \ the TV screens was quickly supported by the constant shivering my body had decided\
  \ to adopt. It really is all fun and games until you can't feel your face anymore.\
  \ \n\nI hiked up a volcano in Ecuador during summer and found myself in a winter-land\
  \ for the day."
