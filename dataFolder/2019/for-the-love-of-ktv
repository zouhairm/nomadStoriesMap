Text: "When I first started teaching in China, everyone talked about KTV. I had no\
  \ idea what it was, and I was worried it was too culturally insensitive to ask.\
  \ I would see buildings all across the city with K-T-V written in bright, bold letters,\
  \ but I was a stranger to what went on inside.\n\nI realized I couldn\u2019t go\
  \ on living in a country without having a clue what this phenomenon was, so I turned\
  \ to my trusty Bing search. Sorry, no Google in China. I found out KTV is similar\
  \ to karaoke. It\u2019s surely not your run-of-the-mill cheesy bar karaoke, though\u2014\
  \ it\u2019s a full-on classy affair with private rooms, quality sound equipment,\
  \ food and drink services, and even disco balls. I was intrigued. \n\nOne Friday\
  \ night, Apple, the head of my school\u2019s English department, invited me out\
  \ for her birthday. I graciously accepted and met Apple, along with a few of her\
  \ closest friends, for hot pot\u2014 simmered vegetables and meat in a communal\
  \ pot of boiling broth. As birthday celebrations often go, we were all well into\
  \ our glasses of wine by the end of the meal. When we finished paying the bill,\
  \ Apple shouted, \u201CKTV! Let\u2019s go to KTV!\u201D\n\nIt was after 10 o\u2019\
  clock at this point. I\u2019d had a long week of teaching, so under normal circumstances,\
  \ I would have headed back to my apartment and gone to bed. But, it was Apple\u2019\
  s birthday, and I felt like I owed her a great night out. Plus, my curiosity peaked\u2014\
  \ I had to experience the mysterious KTV everyone raved about. \n\nWe all left the\
  \ restaurant, dodged the speeding cars across the six-lane street, and headed into\
  \ an unmarked door at the side of a building I wouldn\u2019t have ever known existed\
  \ if I wasn\u2019t with a group of locals. A well-dressed man in a sleek suit greeted\
  \ us, motioning toward the elevator.\n\nThe doors slid open to a chandelier-lit,\
  \ third-floor room with a glistening golden horse statue in the center. Photo panels\
  \ of famous singers lined the wall behind the statue\u2014 Lady Gaga, Rihanna, and\
  \ Shakira captured in pure diva mode. We were led down a dimly lit hallway to our\
  \ own private room, which opened to a plush purple booth, a large marble table,\
  \ multiple wall-length TV screens, a small dance floor, and a stage, complete with\
  \ a vintage microphone.\n\nAs a KTV novice, I looked to my local experts to see\
  \ how things were done. Apple ordered a round of beers, along with popcorn, nuts,\
  \ fruit, and salted chicken feet. Off to the side of the room was the song selector,\
  \ a tablet that would prompt us to first choose a country (China, England, or America)\
  \ and then choose a song. As I browsed the English and American song lists, I was\
  \ impressed with the variety\u2014 everything from \u201CLinger\u201D by the Cranberries\
  \ to \u201CSorry\u201D by Justin Bieber.\n\nApple jumped right in. Choosing a slow\
  \ Chinese ballad to start us off, she belted out the song while her friends sang\
  \ and swayed along. I didn\u2019t know any of the words but did my best to join\
  \ beside them. Based on the music video playing on the screen behind Apple, it seemed\
  \ to involve an unrequited love, as most songs do. \n\nThen, it was my turn. When\
  \ I heard the opening bars of the song I chose, Michael Jackson\u2019s classic,\
  \ \u201CBilly Jean,\u201D I hopped on stage. The wine might have given me an extra\
  \ confidence boost, but I still never felt embarrassed or nervous. Everyone was\
  \ there to simply listen to good music and enjoy each other\u2019s company.\n\n\
  That night I finally learned why everyone loved KTV. From Chinese rock ballads to\
  \ American pop hits, it wasn\u2019t about nailing a high note or showing off a new\
  \ dance move. It was all about the way music brought people from all corners of\
  \ the world together."
