Text: "Life in Death Valley\nWe had almost reached a state where we told ourselves\
  \ \u201CWe don\u2019t want to die without visiting Death Valley\u201D. After plentiful\
  \ planning and few unsuccessful attempts, this time we wanted this to work and we\
  \ made it happen. We were more than prepared for this trip and I had laid out a\
  \ plan for day 1, 2 and 3 route maps, navigation, campgrounds to stay \u2026. List\
  \ can go on. Let me share the intricate details as we go on further.\n6 AM comes\
  \ fast, alarms are sounding off and reality sets in. We are on our way to DEATH\
  \ VALLEY. There is something very enigmatic in this very name, I thought and now\
  \ that in few hours of drive, we would see it for ourselves. Perhaps valley would\
  \ unravel many secrets I hoped. There are two routes which we could take to reach\
  \ there and I preferred \u201Cearlier the better\u201D policy and selected the one\
  \ which said 8hr 53 mins and pushed away all other factors that I had to keep in\
  \ mind. Emphasis on the word \u2018factors\u2019 here and you\u2019ll know soon\
  \ about this. We had to take Sonora pass, which serves as the eastern entry point\
  \ for Yosemite National Park and highest highway pass in California and in the Sierra\
  \ Nevada. Just about a few miles away from Sonora pass, it started raining cats\
  \ and dogs and we realized the road is closed for the season and no way could we\
  \ reach Death Valley taking this route. It was one of those moments when I realized\
  \ I should have done what I do best and not plan for the journey and just be a responsible\
  \ shotgun. Now you know the reference to other \u201Cfactors\u201D not being considered.\
  \ My guy, he went bonkers and he gave that \u201CSee where you got me, I warned\
  \ you!!\u201D look. I was sad, mad and I wished if I could run at Coyote crazy clowns\
  \ speed and reach DV.  Probable that our brain worked much faster during rainstorm,\
  \ we decided to drive back few miles and go southwards via CA-99 S and reach Fresno,\
  \ which would take about two and half hours. Our next stop was in Bakersfield CA,\
  \ filled gas and after few hours of drive joined highway 178 and then moment of\
  \ truth!!! We cut through the stomach of DV, via highway 190. \n   Nothing really\
  \ had gone according to our plan, well accurately my plan!! After all, \u2018The\
  \ beast laid plans go astray\u2019. I must say, Death Valley is one of the most\
  \ overlooked national parks, visitors assuming that it\u2019s just a massive landscape\
  \ filled with sand and cacti. I mean really! Who wants to visit a desert? It\u2019\
  s a natural pun the way geography and civilizations have established down here,\
  \ having Las Vegas next to it, where there is nothing but people whereas Death Valley\
  \ has everything but people.\nNow we were scaling through the twisty canyon roads\
  \ of Panamint springs, beautiful salt extraction points and railroads to transport\
  \ them. Further as we reached Mosaic canyon, driving through rough unpaved roads\
  \ did not fail to surprise us. Hike walled with both mosaic and smooth marbleized\
  \ rocks. It was like waking though the art exhibit. As we had many other places\
  \ to cover, we did not complete the 4-mile hike. But we got just enough serving\
  \ to relish the flavor.\nFurther after we turned the last corner, it almost feels\
  \ like monstrous dunes pop out of nowhere. As we approached mesquite flat sand dunes\
  \ we are simply blown away. We took a walk deep into the dunes, amidst wind blowing\
  \ around and raising up tiny particles of sand. After spending some time amongst\
  \ the dunes, we reached a junction where one of the route takes us to Scotty\u2019\
  s castle but decided to continue on 190 towards visitor center at furnace creek.We\
  \ pitched our tent in Texas springs campground for the night.\nNext day we covered\
  \ Dante\u2019s view, Zabriskie Point, Artists palette, bad water basin and we were\
  \ all set to return, calling it off. I must say Death Valley is still one of my\
  \ favorites and an adventurous trips I have had."
