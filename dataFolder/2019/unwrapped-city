Text: "What would you think if you\u2019d see the The Sony Center complex on the third\
  \ position of the ranking \u201CTop places you should see in Berlin\u201D in your\
  \ guidebook? I am sure it would be something like \u201CWhat am I going to do there?!\u201D\
  \ \n\nI have asked myself this question full of despair right before the boarding\
  \ on my plane to Berlin in the summer of 2015. At first glance, the city indeed\
  \ seemed weirdly rectangular, grey, untidy. What impression could it make otherwise\
  \ if almost every bright spot in the gloomy city center are the \"Doner Kebab\u201C\
  \ signboards?\n\nNone of the tourist would enthusiastically take pictures walking\
  \ around the city, admire the elegance of architecture and enjoy a stunning view\
  \ from its rooftops. Nevertheless, after two days of my journey in Berlin I realized\
  \ that I had never Bennet in such an honest and free place! Berlin doesn\u2019t\
  \ amaze you, it does not even try to. Quite the contrary, this city pushes you away\
  \ as if it says \u201Cjust pass by, dude, there is nothing to look at\u201D.  But\
  \ if you are curious enough and want to unriddle the mystery of this city you would\
  \ find beauty where it is least expected. \n\nBerlin does not hide and cover anything,\
  \ it is extremely sincere and straight. Here you can literally feel the darkest\
  \ time in the history of mankind. The very first one is by the  Berlin Wall - the\
  \ scar that was dividing the city into two parts during 28 years. There you will\
  \ stand over the loopholes dug by people who wanted to reunite with their families\
  \ and lovers and were probably killed for their attempts to escape. \n\nAlso, Berliners\
  \ chose not to restore the Kaiser Wilhelm Church that was badly damaged in a bombing\
  \ raid in 1943. The ruins of the old church were retained and its ground floor was\
  \ made into a memorial hall. Tourists called it \u201CBlue Church\u201D because\
  \ of the glowing blue light glasses of the building. The secret of the glow comes\
  \ from its specific architecture: the light sources between the two walls illuminate\
  \ the glass of numerous cells in the concrete which gives out the mysterious blue\
  \ color from the windows .\n\nAnother place in Berlin with powerful energy is The\
  \ Memorial to the Murdered Jews of Europe right in the center of the city. It is\
  \ a huge site covered with 2700 concrete slabs of different sizes and height. When\
  \ you walk between these flat stones passageways can become very narrow and some\
  \ of the slabs so high that you suddenly start feeling hopeless, fear, insecurity\
  \ - almost everything that the victims of the Holocaust were feeling. Therefore\
  \ tourists rarely take photos from out there, maybe out of respect for the memories\
  \ or maybe they just do not want to capture these moments.\n\nIf you are a seeker\
  \ of experience and a hunter for cool instagram pictures you should probably go\
  \ to Rome, or Paris, or another city with great architecture, world known sights\
  \ and clean cosy streets. But Berlin is different - like an independent, cold, willful,\
  \ majestic guy. He is not interested in winning hearts, even the \u201CI love Berlin\u201D\
  \ t-shirt is not easy to find in souvenir shops. Berlin does not love, Berlin IS\
  \ loved, loved by its residents and those who he had chosen to be loved by.\n\n\
  When you try to have a small talk with a Berliner he would definitely ask, looking\
  \ closely and seriously at you \u201CSo, how\u2019s Berlin?\u201D. And every time\
  \ after my answer \u201CIt\u2019\u2019s not possible to express in one word, this\
  \ city is something special\u201D, they had this ecstatic expression on their faces,\
  \ like a parent who received praises for his child. That is truly an example of\
  \ a deep and faithful love.\n\nAuf Wiedersehen, Berlin! I will be missing you!"
