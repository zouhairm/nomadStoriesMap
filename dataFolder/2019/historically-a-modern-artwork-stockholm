Text: "The mystery of this stunning city lies beneath and beyond it's main streets.\n\
  The cleanest and friendliest city I have ever had the pleasure if visiting. \nMy\
  \ first visit, was a Saturday night. The city air was warm and filled with the scent\
  \ of summer.\nA group of us took to the city streets of Stockholm, to experience\
  \ the local nightlife...But we were pleasantly surprised by what we came across...it\
  \ seems we created our own city night tour. Every corner we turned, the more steps\
  \ we took, we were met with astounding beauty. Historical buildings and cobbled\
  \ stoned streets in this modern day Stockholm. Along the way...we gathered a few\
  \ friendly locals, who turned in to our own personal tour guides.\nTogether, on\
  \ our journey, we came across a hole in the wall...The vibe, and energy was felt\
  \ upon approaching the front entrance...\nWe had finally reached, what we had been\
  \ in search of all night, and we arrived with real locals, by our side.\nStockholm\
  \ Local Nightlife...\nBut we definitely got more than we were search of... the city\
  \ put on the best performance of all time for us.\n\nAt this point, I had travelled\
  \ to many cities:\nFinland, Copenhagen, Tallin, Amsterdam, St Petersburg, New York\
  \ City, Washington DC, Los Angeles,  Denver, ...\nBut Stockholm not only stole the\
  \ show, it stole my heart."
