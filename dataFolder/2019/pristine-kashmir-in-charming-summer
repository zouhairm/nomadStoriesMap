Text: "Treks through any terrain are delightful. Kashmir elevated the bar with its\
  \ sparkling lakes surrounded by towering peaks and rolling meadows. Complementing\
  \ the incredulous beauty is the indomitable warmth of its residents who are selfless\
  \ in their hospitality, scrupulously honest in their dealings, carefree in their\
  \ laughter and honest with their struggles. They have their chin up despite the\
  \ bad press and the atmosphere of general mistrust and animosity which pervades\
  \ any discussion about Kashmir. Our trek was through India hikes who've done a marvellous\
  \ job with the arrangements. Please do visit the lidderwat camping grounds and explore\
  \ the lakes of tarsar and sundarsar with any trekking group. The locals can organise\
  \ an expedition too. You can trek or ride sturdy horses all through the way. It's\
  \ an easy trail with elevation being the only issue on a couple of days out of the\
  \ 6 days one treks. Once you've visited it, any mention of Kashmir will light up\
  \ your memory with flashbacks of glorious nature and pristine beauty. \nAnsar is\
  \ from pahalgam and runs a hotel there. He arranged food for us after all hotels\
  \ in the vicinity had closed for the day. He invited us to his farm to harvest apples\
  \ and stay with his family. Iqbal was handling logistics for India hikes and invited\
  \ us to his house where he treated us to macaroons and kahwa. Ansar and Iqbal are\
  \ not the exception but the norm in Kashmir. Kashmir left my heart just a little\
  \ bit bigger. Neeraj and nikhita signed up for tarsarmarsartrek through indiahikes\
  \ and invited me to join in knowing my love for adventure, abysmally low threshold\
  \ for cold and superfast metabolism. My main concerns were about the trail, weather\
  \ and toilets. altitude sickness is real and accounts for countless failed expeditions\
  \ and human lives. I didn't want to bear the brunt of an unforgiving weather which\
  \ would make the trek a pain and sleeping at night impossible. Most importantly,\
  \ where does one put out what goes in, when concrete toilets are unavailable!\n\n\
  The trek couldn't have gone better. We got mild showers only on the first day and\
  \ clear sunlight on the other days. The hillman tents were exceptional and the sleeping\
  \ bags kept us toasty warm in 3 degrees. We'd pitch and unpitch our tents ourselves\
  \ in the organiser's bid to make us independent trekkers . Two pink tents were the\
  \ detachable toilet tents. A pit would be dug into the ground, a mound of cocopeet\
  \ would be kept beside it and the pink tent would be pitched over it. We were to\
  \ mimic cats and cover up after our nature's call with the cocopeet. \nOur tents\
  \ and food were transported on the beautiful horses. India hikes doesn't allow bonfires.\
  \ Fortunately, the locals regaled us with their warm tales and bonfires whenever\
  \ we popped up around their tents. The piece de resistance - lakes tarsar, marsar\
  \ and sundarsar.\nCrystal clear and shimmering potable water which snakes out through\
  \ various paths and quenches the thirst of humans and livestock around it. Part\
  \ of the reason plastic bottle trash is not found along the trail. People refill\
  \ their bottles from the abundant water. The water is chilling cold in the morning\
  \ and warms up as the day progresses. The various hues of the boundless sky are\
  \ reflected in these waters. The fiery blue and orange of the day and the tranquil\
  \ grey of the night.\nIndiahikes policy states that repeat trek costs are borne\
  \ by them to cultivate a love for the outdoors. That's going to make the reunion\
  \ trek we batch mates have planned a couple years hence a little more sweeter. \n\
  Ansar and Iqbal are in regular touch with us through calls and social media. We\
  \ plan to visit them this year to explore the tarsar trek on horseback and harvest\
  \ apples from their bounteous orchards. They operate from a center of abundance\
  \ and delight in opening up their hearts and homes to travellers from all over the\
  \ world, mindful of their privilege in being born in unarguably the prettiest place\
  \ in India, yet letting their complex equation with their own country sit light\
  \ on their shoulders."
