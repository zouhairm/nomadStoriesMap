Text: It was a liberating freedom. The vibrating sensations as each movement passed
  me. As each breath I took to descend into the world below captivated every atom
  in my body. I knew then, how small we were in this grand world. Yet, how large of
  an impact we can make if we all worked together towards change. My first dive was
  off Bloody Bay Wall. The first time I saw a sea turtle swim in it's element. Free
  of captivity. The first time I saw the colors of each ecosystem, painted in shells
  and corals and fish; like floating art. It was breathtaking. It was unforgetable.
  10 days was not enough for me to want to save our planet, one ocean, one beach,
  one coast line at a time. The impact cleaning beaches in the Cayman Islands left
  me with a life long lesson of perservation and enviromental safety. Since 2011 I
  have strived to make an impact against how our world is treated, one volunteer opportunity
  at a time. Traveling has been a passion of mine ever since that first dive. I continue
  to travel with hopes of experiencing new cultures, meet new people, and change every
  step I can in helping those see the value of our planet.
