Text: "The rays of the winter sun filtered through the immense window of the room,\
  \ the wood of the floor was painted of faint orange that invaded the space, little\
  \ by little, until hit me. When the light reached me, I was already sitting on the\
  \ bed, meditating on thousands of things, but concentrating at one in particular.\
  \ Without further ado, I gave a reply! I left the room across the hall to the kitchen,\
  \ to prepare the chocolate de tablilla, accompanied by the Past\xE9is de Bel\xE9\
  m.\nWhile everything was still in silence, my head continued to spin and draw conclusions.\n\
  Breakfast had been disposed on a small improvised tray and I was staggering and\
  \ praying in order to it would not fall and break down. Then, I carried it to the\
  \ room where Adelaide was. She was laying on the bed, still asleep, with a slight\
  \ grimace drawn on her face, with her hair resting on her back. \nAn incredible\
  \ postcard invaded my mind, and all those thoughts that had occupied me during the\
  \ night until the morning had disappeared. \nHowever the mere fact of returning\
  \ to the previous evening made me shudder.\nIt had been seven months since we had\
  \ last seen each other. \nA beyond belief city gazed us living thousands of stories\
  \ together, walking through the gardens of Sabatini, praying in the Almudena cathedral,\
  \ drinking a ca\xF1a, watching a play in Lavapi\xE9s\u2019 theater, but above all,\
  \ having deep conversations. \nSpeaking as time did not matter when sunsets will\
  \ pass, albeit we continue sharing our fears, dreams, hopes and desires.\nTime has\
  \ flown and our ineffable days together vanished when we were sitting on a bench\
  \ at the Barajas airport. Adelaide had to return to her small home on the Ribera\
  \ del Duero with the illusion of seeing me again and filled of saudade; whilst I\
  \ had to cross the Atlantic and return to my family, leaving her for a while. My\
  \ heart had now turned Lusitanian.\nThe distance became unbearable. \nGray afternoons\
  \ became darker and darker. I was going to the same old paths, with a small bottle\
  \ of tequila that at times it felt like a solace, but then\u2026 I was overwhelmed\
  \ by my thoughts asking me, where is she?\nWe met again, after the absence. \nWe\
  \ were returning to a city we had adopted. A place that transport us to the courts\
  \ of the Spanish empire, in the sixteenth century, during the command of Felipe,\
  \ \"El Hermoso\", sheltered among its churches and castles. The first capital set\
  \ on the shoreline of the Tagus River, high on cliffs that were bordered by the\
  \ ancient walls, communicated by hundreds of narrow alleys, full of cobbled slopes\
  \ and illuminated by lamps, that led to different squares, markets, churches, mosques\
  \ and synagogues, that housed many of residents with accents and languages that\
  \ I could not understand.\nIt was the third Friday of February and that day we were\
  \ celebrating our first anniversary. \nI had ordered a dinner in the finest place\
  \ I could find, and it was the hotel restaurant that seemed to be a medieval castle.\
  \ We were delighted with cochinillo al horno merging with a red wine, while the\
  \ words flowed and laughter invaded the atmosphere of the room. The dessert was\
  \ already on the table, it happened to be traditional tarta toledana, with a layer\
  \ of sweet and cloying mazapan that would starting off to become as sour as I can\
  \ remember\u2026\nFrowning and blurring her smile, Adelaide expressed her great\
  \ disappointment.\nI tried to explain, but none of my attempts had any basis; however,\
  \ her words seemed to have no retort. The evidence was cold, without any emotion\
  \ and with uneven interpretations.\nTears and choked cries whereas memories and\
  \ promises were falling apart.\nWith a lack of breath, she only repeated phrases\
  \ hurting us, one by one, while my suffering intensified in the meantime I saw her\
  \ struggling not to falter ... paralyzing me.\nNow I'm here, handing over her the\
  \ breakfast, trying to repair everything incessantly, in the last few hours we have\
  \ together\u2026 until I fly back again for her."
