Text: "Finding myself in a place outside of time, where the air moves ever so subtly\
  \ slower and the sound of cowbell dances through the breeze like confetti, I sat\
  \ down upon the great stone waterway and laid down my coca offerings. Below me,\
  \ a valley curved its way south. Among the ruins, the only occupants were a herd\
  \ of sheep and an old Andean couple. She, wearing her classic brown bowler hat and\
  \ brightly colored skirt, stood up and looked towards the Eucalyptus forest where\
  \ he was collecting large pieces of wood. She draped her blanket, full of branches\
  \ five feet long, over her back and walked towards him. \n\nI had arrived here by\
  \ way of my faithful aversion to the path most traveled. We had come from Pisac,\
  \ in the Sacred Valley of the Incas, back to Cusco to utilize an excellent local\
  \ resource called the South American Explorers Club. There, we found books, maps,\
  \ volunteer opportunities, Internet access, free coffee and a thirty plus year old\
  \ international network of people, places and services in and around the Sacred\
  \ Valley of Peru. There we met a fellow traveler who turned us on to the free ruins\
  \ near the UNESCO World Heritage Site of Saqsaywauman. \n\nWhen we arrived at the\
  \ Templo de la Luna, it was midday. The place emanated the kind of presence that\
  \ envelopes ancient sacred sites -- the kind of presence that evokes visions and\
  \ remembrances of primordial beginnings. We sat there quietly for a few moments,\
  \ breathing in that kind of sanctity and imagining moonlight. When our restlessness\
  \ finally prompted us to action, we departed the cave to explore the continuing\
  \ network of lava tubes.  \n\nThis is where I drifted off. I noticed towards the\
  \ north there was a beckoning hill with massive boulders and another, less noticeable\
  \ cave. While my companions were busy sniffing their own trail, I began trekking\
  \ uphill towards this lone cave and its quiet immensity.\n\nAs I approached, I remembered\
  \ my local shamanic friend's advice, and made a little bundle of coca leaves, sending\
  \ my breath through them to the local apus, or mountain deities, asking for their\
  \ blessing. Thus offered, I mixed the leaves with llicta, and placed it all in my\
  \ mouth, masticating it into a nice juicy green paste. I tucked it in my cheek and\
  \ savored the sweet taste of the lye. \n\nWhen I arrived on top of the boulders,\
  \ I noticed something tucked between two rocks near the center. It was a piece of\
  \ paper. I picked it up and unfolded it. The paper was grid paper, like the students\
  \ here use, and on it were written notes in Spanish. It was titled: \"the origin\
  \ of the universe: the big bang and other theories of expansion.\" It continued\
  \ to read on the theories of expansion, creation and contraction, as well as the\
  \ laws of gravity and the law of attraction.\n\nThus satiated, I continued towards\
  \ the valley and the idyllic herd of sheep roaming about in timeless leisure. Scattered\
  \ around me were ancient ruins, crumbled stones and memory returning to the earth\
  \ and yet simultaneously enlivened by the active presence of the sheepherders. A\
  \ lifestyle, I imagine, relatively unchanged in the last few hundred years: sheep,\
  \ coca, potatoes; pan flutes, dance and celebration; an integrity with the natural\
  \ world that is so missing from our lives in America. These \"ruins\" are only so\
  \ named by way of foreigners declaring their importance and antiquity. Before UNESCO\
  \ and other global declarations of cultural preservation created such a divide,\
  \ local people actively used many of the world heritage sites in the Sacred Valley.\
  \ Whether farming guinea pigs or storing potatoes, a stone structure in the Andean\
  \ mountains is just plain useful, whether 20 years old or 200. \n\nBy the time I\
  \ reunited with my travel companions, I was riding a horse named Tornado, followed\
  \ by a short smiling Quechua man and few straggling sheep. I had given him five\
  \ soles for the five-minute ride through the ruins, back to the Templo de la Luna,\
  \ the Temple of the Moon. Though Tornado returned me to my own world of time and\
  \ modernity, my pocket still held the origin of the universe."
