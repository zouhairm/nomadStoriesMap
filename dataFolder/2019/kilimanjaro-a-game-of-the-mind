Text: "It is eleven o\u2019clock and with the rustle of several polyamide layers,\
  \ I step out of my tent into the frigid night. Barafu base camp is set at 4,637\
  \ meters altitude in a barren lava field, studded with only a few lone boulders\
  \ and piles of abandoned stretchers. A creeping tide of clouds washes up the lower\
  \ edge of the plain. Before us, a torch-lit procession is already snaking up Kilimanjaro\u2019\
  s imposing white face. We rub our hands together, gulp down some ginger tea and\
  \ having mustered the courage for the summit attack, finally tail on.\n\nRichard,\
  \ our local guide, leads the trudge up the narrow scree footpath. He points to his\
  \ oily cacao forehead. The lack of oxygen draws breath short, causing him to release\
  \ words punctuated by heavy pants: \u201CIt\u2019s\u2026a\u2026game\u2026of\u2026\
  the\u2026mind\u201D. Each utterance comes out of his mouth with a ghostly puff of\
  \ steam twinkling in the headlights. We acknowledge his words with a buttoned-up\
  \ nod. \u201CPole, pole!\u201D\u2013\u201Cslowly, slowly\u201D, he offers, turning\
  \ back to the trail that he knows all too well.\n\nTwo hours of silent footslogging\
  \ pass. I hear my temples pulsating uncontrollably. When the temperature reaches\
  \ -15\xB0C, each gust of wind causes my body to flutter like a white flag of surrender.\
  \ My toes feel as stiff as popsicles. As the body rings all of its biological alarms,\
  \ the mind slips into mountain madness. What if today the sun won\u2019t rise? The\
  \ horizon remains dark. Each passing second draws out infinitely in anticipation\
  \ of the advertised summit sunrise\u2013an event marking the end of the arduous\
  \ ascent. I think of all the calm sleepers back on Earth, separated from us by a\
  \ thick blanket of clouds, ignorant of our self-imposed torment. The task feels\
  \ all the more Herculean.\n\nJust when the sky looks its darkest, the horizon begins\
  \ to crack open. We take the final strained steps onto the crater rim\u2014the mountain\u2019\
  s fifth distinct ecosystem. A glittering snowy plain extends before us, framed by\
  \ Kilimanjaro\u2019s monumental glaciers standing in the clouds. From here, we can\
  \ already see the 360-panorama of the unravelling African dawn. The sun outpaces\
  \ us in a hurry to claim its place in the waking sky. It is the closest I have ever\
  \ stood under it. \n\nThe end is now in sight: Uhuru peak, 5,895 meters above the\
  \ seaside to which my thoughts are already descending. Only a few more steps and\
  \ the wooden signpost greets us on the top of the \u201Cworld\u2019s highest free-standing\
  \ mountain\u201D. We oblige Richard with a high five, but no one stacks silly cairns.\
  \ Relief meshes with helpless anger as we pose stiff-faced for the obligatory shot,\
  \ cheeks hot from tears, mumbling bitterly \u201Cnever again, never again\u201D\
  .\n\nWe slip down the raw scree slopes, descending through red lava plains, the\
  \ misty moorlands, the mellow heathlands and finally, into the steamy rainforest.\
  \ Each change of scenery makes the torments of the past hours seem more distant.\
  \ The headache melts away. Two porters hurry past with a stretcher carrying a hiker\
  \ tangled in pain\u2014a last poignant reminder of the reality of our nocturnal\
  \ struggle. \n\nBut with each passing day, my memories evolve. When I think of that\
  \ night, I now recall the warm sun spilling onto the Savannah like a tropical nectar.\
  \ The coy heaps of clouds resting at my feet, as if scared of ripping on the serrated\
  \ talons of the ice fields that I had just conquered. The feeling of towering over\
  \ the world is unearthly. Would I do it again? Any day."
