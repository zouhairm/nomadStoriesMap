Text: "Early morning March, 24 2017. Full of thoughts in my mind. Couldn't sleep.\
  \ It's been a year since I'm back to Indonesia. Got a good job, but culture shocked\
  \ made me depressed. I can't cope it. \n\nA hot mint tea accompany my loneliness\
  \ while my vision stuck  at  Terminalia Mantaly tree. Heavy rain outside. Thunderstorm\
  \ bursts a silent early morning. Like a thousands of tiger roars for foods. \n\n\
  My mind raged violently. While my other hand type a words on Google to search a\
  \ nearest place to go to. At least a quite place to calm my mind. \nMany options\
  \ appears, but there's only one link that stole my attention. \"Cijulang Green Canyon\
  \ West Java\". \nJust in a second I'm searching for the transportation options to\
  \ reach that place. \n\n8am, Gambir Stasiun Jakarta. Shower rain still flushed the\
  \ city but doesn't bother the city morning rush.  . After printed out my train boarding\
  \ ticket, went upstairs to wait the time for departure to Bandung West Java. \n\n\
  8.15am Train departure on time. A happy smile,  in a big city like Jakarta transportation\
  \ time table always  a mystery. I fall asleep and awake 10 minutes before arrived\
  \ Bandung, west java. \nJati Luwih rice field lays on the left side of railway like\
  \ a green welcome carpet. Amazing! Mountains and buildings around the hills suddenly\
  \  remind me of a city in Portugal, Braga. I'm amazed. I've heard that Bandung has\
  \ a street called Braga, while Portugal has a city nemed Braga. And thanks God no\
  \ rain! \n\n10.37am arrived Bandung. I rushed out to the other road to the mini\
  \ bus office to check the schedule to the green canyon. \n\"Come back around mid\
  \ night sir\" ... \"we will depart at midnight\" damn! I didn't check about it.\
  \ If I know they'll depart at midnight I will take afternoon train. Well I'm here\
  \ now, so a city tour might be a good idea. \n\nBandung city has a uniqueness signature.\
  \ The familiar of Sundanese people really warmed my heart. Traditional Sundanese\
  \ foods \"lalapan\" served with rice and grilled chicken breaks my lunch. My tummy\
  \ is happy. After that spent my time to visit Braga street , factory outlet at jalan\
  \ Riau and then ended up in a massage room in the evening. \n\n01.00am our minibus\
  \ depart from Bandung to Pangandaran. A small conversations between me and the local\
  \ surprises me. They're living in Pangandaran but didn't know about the Green Canyon.\
  \ \"As I know Cijulang  is near Kidul mountain\" chirped the lady who sat next to\
  \ the driver. The driver then replied her \"don't you ever said to confuse him.\
  \ He's  new here\". The driver try to neutralized my confusedness face. \"After\
  \ Pangandaran we will dropp you off at Cijulang where the Green Canyon is\". He\
  \ added. As a new person inside mini van with eight strangers makes me can't sleep\
  \ until we arrived at Pangandaran.\n\n6am Pangandaran. \nAfter drop them off the\
  \ driver said to me to sleep a little bit. He said, \"they are farmers who focusing\
  \ harvest their land and bring to the city, to get Rupiah for their children who\
  \ study in the university. So they never traveling to look at the beautiful nature\
  \ nearby.\" \n\n6.55am we arrived at Cijulang. \nA beautiful green toska color river\
  \ wake my eyes up. Very beautiful morning. Morning sunshine shining trough the coconut\
  \ leaves makes a beautiful light silhouette. I take a deep breath as a sign of grateful\
  \ to God and universe. Really beautiful morning. \n\nWith a small boat we are heading\
  \ to the Green Canyon. A beautiful scenery along the way to Green Canyon. Before\
  \ entering the Green Canyon we are passing 3 amazing  water falls. And then our\
  \  guide turn off the boat machine. And as a sudden, we only hearing sound of nature.\
  \ So peaceful. Some people are going down to the cave while me choose to stay inside\
  \ the boat to enjoy the beautiful of Green Canyon Cijulang, West Java."
