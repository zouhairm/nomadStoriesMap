Text: "I went travelling with my friend Furry Agustini in 2016. That was our first\
  \ time travelling. We both did not know anything about flight and airplane. We did\
  \ not even know that check in early is very important to do before having a flight.\
  \ Our flight route was Makassar-Jakarta-Singapore-Thailand.\n\nMy friend and I were\
  \ late one minute before flight. So, we both missed the flight to Jakarta. Damn!\
  \ That was the first time we go travelling and missed the flight. Finally, we bought\
  \ other tickets to hunt our next flight and yeah we got it.\n\nArrived in Jakarta,\
  \ we directly went to find the place to check in because we were afraid to miss\
  \ the flight anymore. The next flight went so well. But we needed 22 hours to stay\
  \ in Singapore having a transit. And you know? We did not even have a dollar to\
  \ buy something to eat. Fortunately, I brought some breads and wafer in my case.\
  \ We only ate that food to fill our stomache for 22 hours.\n\nThe next flight was\
  \ going to Thailand. Because none of us had ever going to travel overseas, we did\
  \ not know whether or not we checked in again in Singapore to Thailand. We both\
  \ had different perception. So I decided to ask the airport staff and he said that\
  \ we had to chek in again before going to Thailand. The problem was we did not know\
  \ the place and it was an hour before flight. We finally ran finding out where to\
  \ check in. \n\nUnfortunately, there were so many people stood in line. My friennd\
  \ and I almost lose hope. My friend then ran to the frontliner desk and I beg an\
  \ apologize for all the people stood in line and they could understand our situation.\
  \ \n\nAfter having a chat with the frontliner, he asked us to go another place to\
  \ check in again and it was far from our place. What we did just ran and believe\
  \ in God that we could pass the situation. Then we ran away with a hungry stomach\
  \ and a thirsty throat found the place we had to go. You know? Some of the frontliners\
  \ did not want to serve us because the flight would go thirty minutes more. Again\
  \ and again, we almost lose hope. Then there was a good one wanted to serve and\
  \ help us. \n\nFinally, one minute before flight we arrived at the gate and alhamdulillah\
  \ we did not miss the flight to Thailand. \n\nAfter arriving in Thailand, we did\
  \ not know what to do again. Then we read the paper given in the airplane and apparently\
  \ we had to have booked a hotel before entering the country but we hadn't. OMG!\
  \ We tried to find simcard for internet and searched the cheap hostel in Bangkok\
  \ and we found it. It was an hostel that we could stay for two people in one room.\
  \ It did not stop there, we had still another problem. We did not know how to use\
  \ public transportation to go to our hostel. Maybe, some people there knew that\
  \ we were zero about Thailand, they appeared to us and asked about what we were\
  \ going to do. We finally told the truth. Fortunately, they were kind and guided\
  \ us to the hostel. After having a train trip, we walked away for some kilometers\
  \ to go to the hostel in a shiny day and with a hungry stomache. \n\nAfter finding\
  \ the hostel, my friend and I laid down and sleep for 22 hours. It was because we\
  \ were so tired after having unexpected experience beginning in Makassar, Singapore\
  \ and the last is Thailand. What a travel!"
