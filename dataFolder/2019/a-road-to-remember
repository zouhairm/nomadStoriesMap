Text: "It was a short visit to  Chian Mai (a city in north of Thailand) . I decided\
  \ that I would book a tour package the the tour was supposed to take me to DOI SUTHEP\
  \ Mountain peak by hiking next morning. And I will have a guide who will help me\
  \ with stuff. \n\nBut as we know things doesn't go as planned, tour guide never\
  \ came to pick me up I got up around 9:00 a.m. to find out that either I book another\
  \ tour next day or I have to do that on my own, after talking to some locals and\
  \ bit of a Google research I decided that I would bike to the top all let's say\
  \ almost to the top :D. \n\nI went to the nearest bike renting stop and got a  mountain\
  \ bike so the total distance was around 35 km to the top and on my way back I would\
  \ have a nice Downhill to enjoy the ride \n\nI started my ride and was so happy\
  \ , on my way  I visited the Grand Palace and Doi Suthep Temple and kept on riding\
  \  towards the peak. Although the ride was bit difficult but I had some experience\
  \ of riding long distances in my city which is Bangalore (India) so I was able to\
  \ ride.\n\nI reached the peak around 3:00 p.m. I view was mesmerising, while descending\
  \ I met another driver with whom I exchange some food and was talking about my ride\
  \ back to the city(Chiang mai). He suggested that I should take the shortcut which\
  \ she is like around 10km lesser. I was so happy that finally someone gave me direction\
  \ to reach the city sooner since it was getting late. \n\nI took that shortcut and\
  \ started riding my bike I could see that the road was becoming really bad but then\
  \ I was relaxed to see cofee villages and I could meet the kids and was happy sipping\
  \ coffee there, by then it was around 5:00 p.m. \n\nAfter riding my bike downhill\
  \ for like 4 kilometres from the last village I could see that it was getting darker\
  \ and and I have no idea where I am heading to because all of a sudden there was\
  \ no road and I was just trying to ride my mountain bike. it was getting darker\
  \ and then it struck me that I am actually stuck in a Jungle. \n\nI had burn all\
  \ my mobile battery and the camera battery while taking pictures coming up feel\
  \ so there was only one last battery left in my mobile phone first thing what I\
  \ did was that I called up to my to a guy whom I met biking up and send him a passport\
  \ details about me and then told him to send it to the police station and also told\
  \ him my hostel were  I am staying so in case I am stuck here maybe they will find\
  \ me. \n\nBy that time it was pitch dark I couldn't see anyone coming up or going\
  \ down it was one of the most scariest night of my life, I had heard stories that\
  \  there are no tigers or any dangerous animals but they could be snakes which could\
  \ be venomous or even an insect which bites and then you are sick for like 7 days\
  \ with fever so I was like really scared it was pitch dark in  and after hours all\
  \ I could see was that there is a lake far behind down in the foothill so I should\
  \ just walk towards that. \n\nI wasn't able to ride my bike because it was just\
  \ too steep and the front brakes had locked into the rim.I had to carry the bike\
  \ on my shoulder and walk 35km downhill.I had to cross 3 small rivers with water\
  \ sometimes rising upto hips. \n\nI reached the foothill around 1 am there was a\
  \ temple next to the lake, I asked for help as I had turned my ankle and could walk\
  \ anymore they put me in a truck and dropped me to the hostel."
