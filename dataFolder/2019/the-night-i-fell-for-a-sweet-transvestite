Text: "I have never been a big fan of theatre. Perhaps it was due to the traumatic\
  \ experience of performing in a fourth-grade play where I had to remember page upon\
  \ page of mind-numbing dialogue for an audience that just wanted to escape the building\
  \ as much as I did. For the life of me, I don\u2019t remember the name of the play,\
  \ but I do remember my character\u2019s name was Otto, and I believe he had something\
  \ to do with ruining Christmas. \nBut now here I was 40 years later with my wife\
  \ of 20 years, celebrating her 50th birthday with two tickets to The Rocky Horror\
  \ Picture Show in Stratford, Ontario. Recreational marijuana had just been legalized\
  \ three days prior so it\u2019s probably not so surprising that we ended up meandering\
  \ down a pathway next to the Avon River on a rather cold, crisp autumn evening.\
  \  \n\nThere were decades old trees hanging over the river, their branches bobbing\
  \ up and down on the water\u2019s surface as if sipping a drink. There was a single\
  \ duck, not really a duckling, but certainly not an adult \u2013 is there such a\
  \ thing as adolescent water fowl? Its quack reverberated off the century homes lining\
  \ the bank of the river on the opposite side, bringing our attention to the wonderful\
  \ vision before us; a beautiful sunset dipping below a small green bridge to our\
  \ left with the light shining off the majestic structures before us. To say it was\
  \ picturesque would not be doing it justice. But alas, we had to leave to make our\
  \ dinner reservation before the big show. \n\nWe made our way to Pazzo Pizzeria,\
  \ which was billed as having \u201CStratford\u2019s Oldest Cellar.\u201D I thought\
  \ it was a rather odd point of distinction until we journeyed down the stairs and\
  \ got to our table. The restaurant was contemporary and warm, yet still held onto\
  \ the essence of rustic charm.  The crust of the gourmet pizza we ordered was so\
  \ thin, you could surely see through it if not for the wonderful array of farm fresh\
  \ toppings. Fantastico! \nIt was then time to go to the theatre. Stratford is a\
  \ truly walkable city and while the word \u201Cquaint\u201D does seem clich\xE9\
  , I can think of no other word that fits. There were rows of \u201Csmall-town\u201D\
  \ shops and an amazing assortment of restaurants and pubs. However, it was Saturday\
  \ night and the Stratford Festival was on. There was an almost big city buzz you\
  \ couldn\u2019t see, but certainly feel. This city had some history!\n\nStratford\
  \ first incorporated as a town in 1859 and became a city in 1886. The first Stratford\
  \ Festival was in 1953 where Sir Alec Guinness stared in not one but two plays.\
  \ The force was strong in that one! It\u2019s the same festival where William Shatner\
  \ first started overacting, way back in 1954. Since then, the festival has been\
  \ world acclaimed for theatre of a mainly Shakespearean nature. That is, until now.\
  \ \n\nThe Rocky Horror Picture Show was playing at the Avon Theatre and while I\
  \ truly thought the \u201CPO\u201D on our tickets meant \u201CPremium Orchestra,\u201D\
  \ it turned out to mean \u201CPartially Obstructed.\u201D That explains why I got\
  \ the pair for $70. However, we were pleasantly surprised. While our seats were\
  \ on a slightly strange angle, we were just four rows from the stage. We were so\
  \ close, we were shivering in antici\u2026pation!  Dan Chamerory played the role\
  \ of alien transvestite, Frank N. Furter, to perfection. The rest of the cast was\
  \ just as stellar, justifying the two standing ovations.  \n\nThe theatre itself\
  \ was small and intimate, yet at the same time, very Broadway. There were plush\
  \ red seats and fine red carpet. There were intricate light fixtures and ornate\
  \ chandeliers. Posh boxes allowed a select few to be ensconced in their own private\
  \ experience. But we loved our cheap seats. \nI\u2019m still not the biggest fan\
  \ of theatre, but I would time warp back to Stratford again in a heartbeat. And\
  \ while it is the birthplace of Justin Bieber, I will certainly not hold that against\
  \ the residents of this quaint little city."
