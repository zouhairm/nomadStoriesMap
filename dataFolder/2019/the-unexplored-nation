Text: "My country is among the few ones in the world where every feature is worth\
  \ appreciating.Whether this is a topographical, drainage, weather, architectural\
  \ or traditional. A story is hidden behind each.Diversity is what makes it charming.\n\
  \nIn northern areas, there are spell-binding scenery of world famous, snow-covered\
  \ mountains such as K-2. So, are the waterfalls, fruit and flower gardens , unique\
  \ traditions of tribes practiced from centuries and local cottage industries where\
  \ products are made for export purpose . The enthralling environment attracts one\
  \ like a magnet.These areas seem to be a part of paradise on Earth.People visit\
  \ these areas from every corner of the world and become awe-inspired by the breath-taking\
  \ views.\n\nThe rich and gripping culture that is different in all the four provinces\
  \ is famous around the world.Among these, the most influential was of Mughals. Their\
  \ buildings with eccentric architectural style and exquisite decor is liked by every\
  \ eye witnessing it. Whether it is Badshahi mosque or Shalimar Gardens none could\
  \ ignore the delighting buildings ,murals,stonework with intricate designs and patterns\
  \ .The fashionable yet, quaint sights hold immense beauty.\n\nPakistan offers a\
  \ wide-ranging variety. Settlements from urban houses in cities to nomads in Tharparkar\
  \ to fishermen in Gwadar to herdsmen in Himalayas.Languages of all descriptions\
  \ such as Saraiki, Pashto, Balochi, Punjabi and many accents in each of them is\
  \ an added feature.Similarly, we relish four different seasons in an year-a blessing\
  \ only few countries enjoy. With fruits , flowers and aroma of every season, one\
  \ is never bored even living at one place .That one place sees intense heat, cold\
  \ as well as copious rain and leaf fall.Many uncountable blessings make my country\
  \ unique but to write them require thousands of pages .None can hold whole of a\
  \ sea\u2019s water in a single cup.Every single aspect reveals many chapters and\
  \ in those many chapters there are numerous sub-chapters and in all,there is nothing\
  \ that should be left while praising my country.To let the real beauty reach you\
  \ ,you should, yourself approach it -one must visit the one and the only Pakistan.\
  \ From Gilgit to Gwadar, every \u2018Galli and Kocha\u201D will speak for itself."
