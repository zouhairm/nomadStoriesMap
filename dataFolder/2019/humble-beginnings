Text: In 2016 i left the UK for the first time EVER, i met my current girlfriend who
  is from the Czech Republic and after lots of begging from her i decided to get my
  Passport and make my way to her home country. It truly was a leap into the unknown
  as i have never flown or left the uk and to make matters worse i suffer with bad
  anxiety, however i decide i would do this 100% on my own as Jana was already in
  the Czech Rep and i even bough myself a window seat for the added thrill. Needless
  to say it was a very daunting experience even just being at the airport alone made
  me think twice but i swallowed my fear and got on board my plane. Everything was
  fine until we was over Germany when we had turbulence from a storm passing over
  so again my bravery was tested however i couldn't just get off so i knew i was on
  it till the end. We landed gracefully an i disembarked into a completely new world
  and culture. My girlfriend was waiting for me and we spent the day walking around
  Prague and What a day it was, it was a sensory overload in every essence of the
  word, the sights the smells the people it was all just so incredible i dont have
  enough superlatives to describe it. Two weeks later it was time to come home but
  in that short time i had learned how beautiful and awe inspiring traveling can be
  and i plan to do ALOT more of it. I've been back to the Czech Rep several times
  now an plan on going to many other countries as well. It is truly amazing what traveling
  can do for the mind it sets you free and you learn new things whilst you enjoy yourself
  and that for me is priceless.
