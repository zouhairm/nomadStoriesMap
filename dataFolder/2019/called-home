Text: "\u201CJambo!\u201D the tall robed man called to us. \u201CJambo!\u201D we called\
  \ in return. The word rippled through us like a wave. It was the only word any of\
  \ us knew in Swahili, and we extended it like a handshake. They were Maasai people,\
  \ one of the Kenyan tribes, and until yesterday I knew nothing about their culture.\
  \ They greeted us in a line, all of them tall and very thin and clothed in bright\
  \ red. The women had shaved their heads and were adorned with layers of brightly\
  \ colored beads and blankets. They were beautiful. \nThe man speaking to us wore\
  \ feathers around his neck and carried a long staff, and spoke to our tour director\
  \ with a smile and a friendly tone. How many groups had come before us, I wondered,\
  \ to see how these people live. He led us now through the line of women come to\
  \ greet us, through a break between the huts to the center of the village. We gathered,\
  \ herded like students at an assembly, and they told us about their culture. The\
  \ tribe\u2019s medicine man came out with a basket full of herbs and plants. He\
  \ took each one out and showed it to us, explaining what it was and what the Maasai\
  \ people used it for. This man was carrying an entire drugstore in this little wicker\
  \ basket, and all of it had been taken from the ground. He had a mosquito repellent,\
  \ a malaria cure, headache relief, a toothache remedy, and something to ease women\
  \ in labor. A few jokes were thrown around by the people in our group, \u201CI\u2019\
  ll take some of that\u201D, shouted from someone in the back. They laughed, even\
  \ if they didn\u2019t understand. \nAt the edges of the village there were kids\
  \ running around, hiding and watching us from doorways and behind fences made of\
  \ dried grass. They didn\u2019t wear the bright robes and jewelry, they looked like\
  \ the kids I had led at camp. I wondered what they thought of us, wandering through\
  \ their homes taking pictures of them; if they found us curious, or intrusive. \n\
  One of the tribesmen was kind enough to show us inside one the small huts. A small\
  \ group of us stepped through the doorway into an even smaller room, and I stood\
  \ for a few seconds letting my eyes adjust. The walls were built using mud and sticks,\
  \ he explained, and the only light came from a window the size of a brick tucked\
  \ into one wall. There was a bed, and some food tucked away on some handmade shelves.\
  \ With five of us standing in his home it was very crowded. \nAs we left the village,\
  \ we spoke to one of the younger men about his experience going to college in the\
  \ United States. His name was Daniel, and he had left home to get an education with\
  \ the intention of returning to the village with his degree. I couldn\u2019t help\
  \ but find myself surprised. He said many of the Maasai people who have this opportunity\
  \ will do it. Many find jobs in tourism after, bringing groups just like us here\
  \ so that the Maasai way of life can be seen and understood. But he had chosen to\
  \ come back to his tribe and to his way of life. After receiving an education and\
  \ a degree he donned the red robes and returned home. \nI had never seen a life\
  \ like the one the Maasai led. I wanted to ask him if it was strange, or comforting\
  \ to return to after such a different experience. But I had traveled here, and soon\
  \ I would be on a plane returning to my life in New York. Maybe it is the warm embrace\
  \ of the familiar, and maybe it is pride in your way of life, but I understood.\
  \ We seek the unknown until the familiar calls us home."
