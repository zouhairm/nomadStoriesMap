Text: "Leaving Kampala at dawn in a safari van along with a driver we had hired, my\
  \ parents, my brother Prem, and I soon came upon the Western Rift Valley sprawling\
  \ beside us along the highway with the Ruwenzori mountains in the distance. I recalled\
  \ hearing this area referred to as one of the 'cradles of civilization' for it was\
  \ here some of the oldest fossils of mankind's prehistoric relatives had been found.\
  \ Though not stretching back thousands of millennia, we would also be looking to\
  \ the past on this trip, digging into the red soil to unearth our parents\u2019\
  \ roots as both were born and grew up in Uganda.\n\nOur destination was Queen Elizabeth\
  \ National Park where my father had worked as a game biologist after completing\
  \ his masters in zoology at Makerere University in Kampala. We spent the next two\
  \ days roaming the grassy fields of the African savannah, following the same roads\
  \ my father once did when he was monitoring wildlife in the park. Later, touring\
  \ the laboratory facilities where he conducted his studies, now left to waste on\
  \ the grounds, and the home where he used to live, which had also fallen into disrepair\
  \ and reeked of leopard shit, I caught a brief glimpse of his life before he became\
  \ a father, before he came to Canada, and before the torrents of upheaval would\
  \ wash away all his dreams and aspirations. Of course, we also marveled at seeing\
  \ animals in the park, in their natural habitat, but the wildlife itself almost\
  \ took a backseat to the importance of simply being there, on that seemingly hallowed\
  \ ground, with our father.\n\nWe returned to Kampala for a day before traveling\
  \ east to Jinja, where my mother was born. Seeing the town now, the way of life\
  \ they had known had drastically changed and, tragically, it was for the worse.\
  \ As we drove up and down the dusty streets, looking at the houses where our parents\
  \ used to live, the shops they used to visit, and the school my mother used to attend,\
  \ I tried to picture the town as it must have appeared when they lived there, as\
  \ if by waving my hand in front of my face I could create a video editing wipe to\
  \ transform the present to the past. Despite leaving under duress in 1972 as part\
  \ of the Ugandan Asian Exodus enacted by then despotic president, Idi Amin, they\
  \ never harboured any ill will or bitter recriminations toward the country of which\
  \ they were once proud to call themselves citizens and, even after 40+ years of\
  \ living on the Canadian Prairies, they still considered Africa their motherland.\n\
  \nBefore departing Jinja to visit the sugar cane fields in Kakira, we took a skiff\
  \ from the bank of the Nile to an ait in mid-stream where a modest sign informed\
  \ visitors they were standing at the source of the mighty river, snaking northward\
  \ from Lake Victoria to eventually reach the Mediterranean Sea. Prem and I stood\
  \ at the water's edge where my father came up behind us, placed a hand on each of\
  \ our shoulders and said, 'I never could have imagined, especially given the manner\
  \ we were forced to leave, I would one day return with my two grown sons. And I\
  \ can't describe how much it means to me to be with you both here.' He brushed a\
  \ tear from his eye as the three of us stood in silence, contemplating the moment,\
  \ watching eddies swirl in the water below.\n\nPrior to arriving in Uganda, I hadn't\
  \ anticipated what the trip would mean to me and my brother. I couldn't have foreseen\
  \ forming a profoundly emotional connection to a foreign land, one that I had only\
  \ heard of in stories of life 'back home.' And I certainly didn't intend to discover\
  \ answers to questions I'd never thought to ask, leading me to a deeper understanding\
  \ of who my parents were as individuals. This was no mere family vacation; the journey\
  \ was a hajj, a pilgrimage, not of religious import but one of deeply personal significance.\
  \ And because it was our parents\u2019 native land, our visit became a sort of homecoming\
  \ for me and my brother."
