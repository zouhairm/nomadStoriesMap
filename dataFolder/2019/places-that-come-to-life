Text: "Since were I was a child, I loved the art. This day I woke up early and excited\
  \ because I knew that finally, I will be there mixing with the history and making\
  \ it part of me. I walking around through the streets of Barcelona among the small\
  \ alleys full of cobblestones that were embellished with the spanish songs of the\
  \ musicians with whom I was coinciding everywhere. I enjoyed the coastal breeze\
  \ next to the morning sun while I stopped in a small shop for one of its famous\
  \ ice creams. The contrast of colors with the winter trees seemed fascinating to\
  \ me.\n\nI was anxious as if it were a date with someone I knew for the first time\
  \ and actually, it was something very similar. I hurried, climbed the stairs and\
  \ looked for the first small door that would take me to the initial room where my\
  \ trip would begin. I went into Picasso's life there. I could feel his painting,\
  \ breathe his passion, the strength of his strokes and the determination with which\
  \ he chose each style. The sensations transported me to different places, I could\
  \ understand what he wanted to say, his causes, his truths and the issues that worried\
  \ him. I soaked up the joy of their experimentation, of the pain in the images,\
  \ of the joy of trying different techniques, of exploring and sharing with a great\
  \ variety of characters of his time.\n\nI stopped for a longer time in a very particular\
  \ work, I saw its bright colors and its varied forms. It was one of the paintings\
  \ alluding to \u201CThe Meninas\u201D. One simple, small and perhaps the least eloquent\
  \ of all. There contemplating it for a long time I understood it. He was playing\
  \ and he knew it. That's what it was about. At that precise moment, I thought: How\
  \ much was that allowing me? How much did the artist that was inside me emerge?\
  \ I stopped prowling that question inside me as I kept moving forward. The emotion\
  \ overwhelmed me and I could not contain the tears. The message was strong and clear.\
  \ My world shook so that a new idea became part of me.\n\nWithout realizing it,\
  \ 5 hours passed! We had been talking all this time, discovering our similarities\
  \ and also our differences. I could appreciate more my taste for capturing moments\
  \ from the perspective of the windows, I understood the pauses as a sign of renewal\
  \ and that the proper seal is found as you connect and test. Imperfection is perfection\
  \ itself. How much I saw of me there. How much I learned from him.\n\nThe photos\
  \ I took there only show fragments of what I really experienced. It is very different\
  \ to see him, to feel it inside you. It is not just a famous story reflected in\
  \ a postcard or what you see in a book, it is what is impregnated in your skin.\
  \ Because when you let yourself be touched by the places, a new time and space emerge\
  \ inside you, you take their essence and that which when they come into contact\
  \ with you, it transforms you.\n\nThat day I took a symbol of creativity. A reminder\
  \ in the form of a ring that was an invitation for every day to make it part of\
  \ me and translate it into the simple little things in life.  \n\nThe last phrase\
  \ I remember was a call, an invitation that showed me his character and what motivated\
  \ him. It still resonates in my mind as if it were yesterday: \"everything that\
  \ does not have an objective to reach, a result to be conquered, an enigma to solve,\
  \ a mystery to penetrate; I'm not interested\".\n\nI left with my chest expanded,\
  \ my mind full of ideas and my permission to go beyond my own limits towards the\
  \ search for everything that would give me more meaning and pleasure to my life."
