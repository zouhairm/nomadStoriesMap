Text: "A girl from India, where we are still fighting for the freedom, becoming a\
  \ travelling nomad is a far-sighted dream. So, I have never aimed for one, but thanx\
  \ to my mother\u2019s travel obsession, actually she can travel every-day, but a\
  \ middle-class family can only afford one trip a year. \n\nSo, last year in summer\
  \ vacations we had planned a trip to Rajasthan, because we love history and that\
  \ place is filled with historical forts. But my brother suggested a hill station\
  \ the very last minute and we drove to Dalhousie. I know it seems like a movie script,\
  \ but my family is one, can\u2019t help, HAHA!!!! Actually, we always try to have\
  \ a road trip\u2026 so that we can do anything, within our own comfort and reach,\
  \ and moreover, travel anywhere, anytime, it feels more personal.  \n\nWe started\
  \ our journey and after crossing the heavy traffic of Delhi and Haryana, the beautiful\
  \ fields of Punjab and Himachal, the mountainous roads started. It was sometimes\
  \ fun and adventure but sometimes scary. We reached after the hectic drive and checked\
  \ in the hotel. From childhood, I\u2019ve always been an introvert, because of some\
  \ bad experiences and many phobias. And siesmophobia being one of them has always\
  \ forced me to say no to mountains but this trip made me say yes and that night\
  \ in the hotel room, it reoccurred. I had an anxiety attack which led me to knock\
  \ my parent\u2019s door and asking them to travel back home or at least to plains.\
  \ Of course, it was nearly impossible to travel on those roads at that hour and\
  \ my mother somehow calmed me down and the whole night I was cuddled in her. Next\
  \ morning after the regional breakfast, we headed to khajjiar (mini swiss of India)\
  \ and after some good photography session and fully devouring in the green scenic\
  \ beauty of that place, we started our drive to Dharamshala, we have to take the\
  \ high elevated road, coz the main one was under construction. We have to cross\
  \ Chamba (a village in Himachal Pradesh, 2500ft above sea level), where the roads\
  \ are still unbuilt. Every time there was a 360-degree cut, I faced death, because\
  \ on the co passenger seat, all you can see is no fencing and the deep ocean of\
  \ forests 2500ft down and the chances of landslide on the other side any time.\n\
  \ We had a halt for an hour, because of some potholes filling which gave me the\
  \ opportunity of having a chat with the locals and I got to know that they travel\
  \ by foot daily for every basic necessity as there are no modes of travel, even\
  \ the road construction was done by hands only. The amount of fearlessness and the\
  \ hard work they put daily lead me to shred the phobia and actually living the trip.\
  \ We reached Dharamshala by evening and everyone had their dinner but I had some\
  \ other plans. There was an old couple living near our hotel, on the roof of a house.\
  \ The old lady was cooking some soup and dim sums. Both of them were so welcoming,\
  \ I satiated my hunger listened to uncle\u2019s brave stories, a different experience\
  \ altogether.\nThe next day I was the most excited, as we were visiting the world\u2019\
  s most beautiful and highest elevated cricket stadium of Dharamshala. Cricket is\
  \ my first love and visiting a stadium for the first time was a dream come true\
  \ moment for me. We started our drive and visited the famous tea gardens first.\
  \ They were not that big but a whole new experience for me and the serenity and\
  \ peace that place had, made me feel like I want to live their forever. Then we\
  \ visited the stadium, which is something unexplainable because I couldn\u2019t\
  \ decide what to do, to drink the beauty of those magnificent snow-covered mountains\
  \ behind the screens or to admire the pitch and the green rooms and the scoreboard,\
  \ where so many international matches being played. The trip came to end the next\
  \ day, after we visited the Bhakra Nangal dam and the kangra fort, which is a different\
  \ story altogether but I am limited to words."
