Text: "I was travelling to my hometown after a span of 2 years ..just few kilometers\
  \ before my town I notice a funfair in a nearby village ...I remembered going to\
  \ that funfair when I was a kid ..so remembering that I moved my vehicle and reached\
  \ the village ...it was a yearly fair and there  were many small shops of colourful\
  \ objects ..including food items ...many villagers were going to temple to seek\
  \ blessing from the Godess Laxmi ...small children were running here and ther with\
  \ so much joy ..insisting their older ones to buy games and sweets for them .\n\
  I too visited the temple ..I found tht godess was laughing at me and asking me why\
  \ I didn\u2019t visit her in so many years ....the sound of ringing bells in temple\
  \ reminded me my childhood memories , all my old friends ..I was upset as I could\
  \ not be in touch with any of them ..as soon as I came outside ..I noticed small\
  \ firm selling colourful ballon ..I bought  one and released it into air ..as the\
  \ ballon was going up in the air ..I experienced  serine calmness in my mind ..I\
  \ felt all my worries , stress are going up in the air ...\nI was so rejuvenated\
  \ , I decided to visit this funfair every year and rejuvenate myself and my local\
  \ connections to my roots .."
