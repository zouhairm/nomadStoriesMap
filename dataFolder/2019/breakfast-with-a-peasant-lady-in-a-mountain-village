Text: "For us who are living in a modern metropolis like Istanbul, Kars has always\
  \ been a forgotten far away land next to Armenian border, which nobody would bother\
  \ to visit. In our minds, most of the cities in eastern Turkey were undeveloped\
  \ and there was nothing interesting there to see. What a misconception! \n\nEver\
  \ since Orhan Pamuk, the only Turkish Nobel Prize Winner in literature, had written\
  \ a novel in 2006, which was taking place in Kars, this small remote Anatolian city\
  \ slowly began to be noticed. However, when travel influencers discovered its beauties\
  \ and began sharing photographs on social media, interest in Kars literally skyrocketed\
  \ three years ago. Therefore, as soon as I found a ticket on the Eastern Express,\
  \ I jumped on the train to explore this far away land. \n\n\u201CComing here was\
  \ one of the best decisions I have ever made\u201D I thought to myself as I was\
  \ sitting in the living room of  H\xFCsniye, a peasant lady in a mountain village\
  \ called Bo\u011Fatepe which was approximately an hour drive from the city center\
  \ of Kars. There was snow outside as far as the eye can see.  The old stove which\
  \ was in the middle of the room was not only warming the place but also used for\
  \ cooking. A sharp smell of fresh milk, boiling in a pan on the stove was filling\
  \ the air. The plate on the table full of many different kinds of cheeses were so\
  \ appetizing and they were winking to me as if saying \u201CWe are the most delicious\
  \ cheese you can find all over Turkey. Eat us\u201D \n\nI was here to experience\
  \ a local breakfast in a village which was producing the best cheese in Turkey since\
  \ the 1880\u2019s. \n\n\u201CIn 1879, David Moser, a Swiss cheese producer, stopped\
  \ by in this region and was struck by the terrain and expansive pastures. This land\
  \ is home to many different kinds of medicinal and aromatic herbs. When cows eat\
  \ these herbs, they produce a distinctly flavored milk. Upon discovering this fact,\
  \ Moser established a small cheese factory in the village and soon gruyere production\
  \ became the main industry here\u201D H\xFCsniye told me giving information about\
  \ her village\u2019s history. \n\nAs she kept talking I was noticing that she had\
  \ as much information as a tourist guide would have. She continued explaining that\
  \ in that period Russians and Malakans were living here. After World War I, when\
  \ Turks took over the village Russians and Malakans had to leave this village. \
  \ Later, K\u0131pchak Turks from Georgia migrated here and continued gruyere cheese\
  \ tradition and also produced different varieties of cheese like kashar, chechil....etc.\
  \ \n\n\u201CHow can a peasant woman who haven\u2019t even got high school education\
  \ can know so much about history?\u201D I wondered. But this was just the beginning.\
  \ She managed to surprise me with every sentence that came out from her mouth. \
  \ \n\nShe was a member of Bo\u011Fatepe Environment and Life Association. When this\
  \ association initiated eco tourism in the village, French tourists began visiting.\
  \ \u201CHowever the language barrier was a big issue. So we took French classes\
  \ for a year. Comment allez vous?\u201D she said with a proud smile. At that moment\
  \ my jaw dropped. A peasant woman in a mountain village of Eastern Turkey speaking\
  \ French! That was as weird as hearing an Eskimo speaking Arabic. \n\nI was enjoying\
  \ every minute there tasting the delicious cheeses and listening to her stories.\
  \ After breakfast she offered to show me around the village. We stopped by an old\
  \ building from the Russians\u2019 time which is now used as a common area for the\
  \ villagers. H\xFCsniye told me that she is dreaming to create a library in one\
  \ of the rooms of this building.  We entered a small room full of shelves. On the\
  \ shelves mostly children\u2019s books caught my eye. \u201CWe need novels, poem\
  \ books. We need more variety. Would you send me books and help me achieve my dream?\u201D\
  \ she asked. I promised her that I will send as many books as I can find. \n\nI\
  \ didn\u2019t notice how time flew. As the car that will take me back to city center\
  \ began moving, she waved with a smile saying: \u201CAu revoir\u201D."
