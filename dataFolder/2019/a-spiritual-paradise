Text: "I had never imagined a place within the same country I lived to be so different.\n\
  As part of my self-development journey, I decided to take a weekend trip over to\
  \ beautiful Cains, Australia, from my hometown of Melbourne. \n\nInside my mind\
  \ I saw a warm, colourful place, where I could relax and renew my senses. That was\
  \ what I wanted. \n\nI landed and immediately felt my skin getting clammy as I reached\
  \ Trinity Beach, the high humidity hit me like a slap to the face. I saw the greenery,\
  \ the the blue skies, and smelled the tropical landscape around me. I watched in\
  \ awe as I got driven to my hotel, or, could you really call it a hotel? I thought\
  \ I had booked a humble one bedroom apartment, but I walked into a grand apartment,\
  \ two bedrooms, a kitchen, and living room. \n\nOn my balcony, I could see the green\
  \ trees, the vibrant flowers, and I could hear the sound of the ocean nearby. \n\
  While my head knew I was still in the same country, my heart told me I was miles\
  \ away. Nothing about this place reminded me of home. \n\nI embraced the humidity,\
  \ welcomed the heat, and indulged in the scenery around me. The water felt warm\
  \ and smooth on my naked feet as I strode along the soft, white sand. I watched\
  \ as tourists and locals dined at the restaurants around me, wondering what got\
  \ them there, what was their story?\n\nTrinity Beach is an unexpected gem around\
  \ the many places to visit in Cairns. It is a place where locals help each other,\
  \ friendly faces greet you as you provide to keep their business open in this small\
  \ place of only 4,734 people. Laughter of happy tourists echoes around you. You\
  \ know this is a place where joy finds its heart.\n\nI saw colourful creatures all\
  \ around me, lizards, snakes, and spiders. Although I am usually scared, or uncomfortable,\
  \ around them, I embraced this experience in this beautiful place I could only call\
  \ a real-life paradise. \n\nMy once aching heart, and nervous soul, healed in this\
  \ environment. It was like I had been reborn in the perfect place, at the perfect\
  \ time in my life. \n\nMy journey ended with my spirit renewed, my body used to\
  \ the clammy heat, and my head filled with inspiration, joy, and happiness."
