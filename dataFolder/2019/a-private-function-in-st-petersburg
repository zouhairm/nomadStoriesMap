Text: "There are things you can never get in a five-star hotel or a ten-dollar hostel.\
  \ These experiences are in the street or simply getting to know the locals, who\
  \ by the way should let themselves be known. \nFor many travelers, Russia is not\
  \ a friendly country, but my experience was completely the opposite. On a trip to\
  \ that country in 2012, I stayed at the home of a woman named \nEkaterina, who lived\
  \ with her 11-year-old daughter.\nThey were very kind to me and showed me the places\
  \ to visit, we went for a vodka and chatted a lot. I am a traveller who enjoys the\
  \ cultural offerings of the cities. Russia is a must in that respect.\nDuring my\
  \ walk, I passed by the Mariinski Theatre, where the Mariinski Orchestra operates.\
  \ I went in to ask when the next concerts would be and a woman said to me: \"This\
  \ season's concerts are over. You have to wait a month for the next one.\nWhen I\
  \ spoke to Ekaterina, she told me that she was a musician, but she didn't give too\
  \ many details. After my frustrated experience in the theater, we met at the center\
  \ to try a vodka that she called \"glorious\" (and indeed it was).\nBack home, I\
  \ told her about the Mariinski Orchestra, while we were passing by a fish shop in\
  \ her neighbourhood. She smiled and said, \"I'm a violinist in that orchestra. Tomorrow\
  \ you cook fish and I play the violin after dinner.\nAs a fan of culture, Fyodor\
  \ Dostoyevsky is a writer I admire a lot. After dinner with Ekaterina and her daughter,\
  \ while she played the violin, I felt for a moment that it was part of a novel by\
  \ the Russian writer. The night was beautiful. Our balcony overlooked the street.\
  \ A gentle breeze came in. I had had a wonderful and unexpected experience as a\
  \ traveller. I felt, even for a moment, that happiness was something I could touch."
