Text: "I sat restless while I watched the blue dot on my phone\u2019s map move further\
  \ and further away from any signs of life and into the depths of what I only knew\
  \ at the time was Northern Finland. \n\nIt was about 10:30 in the morning yet through\
  \ the frosted tour bus windows the sky was still shadowed with darkness. You could\
  \ say it took a fair bit of adjusting to the fact that I would only see about three\
  \ hours of daylight here during the winter month of December. \n\nWhen we finally\
  \ arrived I went numb. Stepping off the bus was like copping a snowball straight\
  \ to the face. I inched my hand bravely from the warmth of my glove just long enough\
  \ to check the temperature on my phone: minus 17 degrees. Unheard of. And with that\
  \ the gloves were not to come off again. \n\nLit up by a single lamp post, I was\
  \ surrounded by snow, deep, vast and spectacular snow in amongst a forest of white\
  \ coated spruce trees. It was like a scene from Narnia, only rather than mystical\
  \ creatures I was being approached by reindeers.\n\nWe had arrived at a reindeer\
  \ farm \u2013 a surprise from our tour guide on Christmas Eve \u2013 perhaps in\
  \ this sense, maybe it did feel a little mystical. \n\nOn my right was a small wooden\
  \ hut, a home, and when the owner stepped out it was a presence that couldn\u2019\
  t be ignored. \n\nShe was a small older women woman coated in layers of royal blue\
  \ fabric that was embroidered richly with red and gold and paired with shoes and\
  \ headgear made from the fur of her animals. \n \nIt was the cultural dress of the\
  \ S\xE1mi people, Finland\u2019s Indigenous community, and here, tucked away in\
  \ the middle of the snow dense forest far from any other town or neighbouring homes,\
  \ we were captivated by their way of life. \n\nShe greeted us with few words, using\
  \ mostly generic hand actions and gestures while signalling for us to follow her\
  \ towards an open field and we did so like a herd of sheep. \n\nThere, were two\
  \ younger men \u2013 her sons \u2013 dressed in similar richly coloured ponchos\
  \ that looked much more comfortable than the stiff ski jackets we were sporting.\
  \ If it wasn\u2019t for their flushed pink cheeks you would think they must have\
  \ adapted to this piercing climate.\n\nBeside them were a row of reindeers attached\
  \ to small wooden sleighs lined up for us to experience the true S\xE1mi mode of\
  \ transport that in our minds was simply a novelty \u2013  the ultimate Christmas\
  \ experience. \n\nI perched myself on a sleigh lined with reindeer fur and held\
  \ onto the reins tightly after the men had taught me how to steer, much like riding\
  \ a horse. Then with a jolt my sleigh shifted and carved it\u2019s way through the\
  \ powder slow and steady. \n\nIt was manageable, in fact it was easy, just a slight\
  \ shift of the rope here and there and we had made our way in a full circle around\
  \ the field. They were clearly well trained. \n\nWhen we were welcomed into her\
  \ wooden hut it was deceptively bigger than first I\u2019d imagined and made almost\
  \ entirely out of wood including the furniture, while reindeer antlers were hung\
  \ proudly for decoration.\n\nA fire in the centre of the floor warmed the room,\
  \ while traditional tea served up in smooth mugs made from reindeer antlers warmed\
  \ our insides. \n\nThe reindeers lie at the heart of everything they did here at\
  \ the farm. It was part of S\xE1mi tradition to herd them not only for a means of\
  \ transport and food, but to use their skins for clothing and their antlers for\
  \ handicrafts. \n\nWith their cultural dress and nordic traditions feeling so foreign\
  \ it was no surprise their lives were now intertwined with the tourism industry,\
  \ with the \u2018Reindeer Farm experience\u2019 set up to attract and educate.\n\
  \nAs I walked away from their home in the Inari village of Northern Finland, I was\
  \ handed a small white certificate. It was my reindeer drivers license and despite\
  \ it being about as useless as a pen license the feeling of gratitude and accomplishment\
  \ was undeniable."
