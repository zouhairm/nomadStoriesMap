Text: "Running from the Past\n\nAs I stepped onto the runway, I reminisced. How different\
  \ this had been to my expectation. This foreign land was outspoken yet backwards,\
  \ stuck yet free. But most of all - it was distant. \n\nExploring these past few\
  \ months, I had travelled thousands of kilometres up and down mountain ranges. I\
  \ found myself at the tip of the continent, seeing sights others have only dreamt\
  \ of. I was apart of days people spent their whole lives fantasising about. Yet,\
  \ I felt lost. \n\nI awoke to the sweet aromas of amazing coffee every morning.\
  \ There was no need to reach for my coat. Instead, I looked to the clouds to determine\
  \ the style of hat I required. I did not know where I would end up each day and\
  \ that was exciting! But I quickly fell into a routine - a routine I had never intended\
  \ to find this time around. \n\nWaves crashed, the sun shone and sand sunk between\
  \ my toes. I watched the orange drift away as the stars brightened the night. A\
  \ land down under and stars so high. How could I feel so far away? \n\nThe hiking,\
  \ the beaches, the sunny weather and even the storms had a grip of me. I loved every\
  \ crevice of this country. I could drive for hours and not see another soul. Alternatively,\
  \ I could drive five minutes down the road, find an old friend and be dragged five\
  \ years back. \n\nI had jumped into the arms of those I had missed more than I could\
  \ have ever imagined. Finally, I was apart of what I had once craved. Family, friends\
  \ and stability. It was the norm.\n\nWork: the ultimate goal. The perfect way to\
  \ fit into the standards of society. Weeknights? Weekends? They were meant for bettering\
  \ yourself to improve at the all important career. Travel? That was a myth. Something\
  \ only the lucky or rich got to experience. \n\nI had been here before. I had experienced\
  \ the never ending loop of monotony. I made a change. I ran away. I travelled the\
  \ world and found my home was not in one place. My true calling was everywhere yet\
  \ nowhere. It was ever changing and evolved as the world around me evolved. \n\n\
  So as I presented my ticket to fly out of Brisbane; I left \u2018home\u2019. It\
  \ is a funny feeling knowing I do not belong there anymore. It is funny to know\
  \ that I will always be welcome, but will never quite fit in. Or, is it that \u2018\
  home\u2019 no longer fits in with me? \n\nBy Shelley Doherty"
