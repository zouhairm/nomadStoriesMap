Text: "A hot August day, 2018. Giovanni and I, almost lost in the Albanian countryside.\
  \ We are trying to reach the Adriatic sea for a refreshing bath in the water. We\
  \ are crazily driving, with all the windows opened to get as much wind as possible,\
  \ with the only help of a map on a travel guide. We pass trough a chaotic city with\
  \ a complicated name and decide to leave it behind us and continue to find a calmer\
  \ place where to rest. At a certain point we abandon the wide and busy highway and\
  \ we take a smaller road, desperately looking for a signal pointing at the sea.\
  \ We soon lose our orientation, we are in the middle of nowhere, few people around\
  \ and nondescript buildings surrounding the dusty road. As long as we keep on going\
  \ the road become unpaved, and the vegetation grow around wilder. Suddenly, another\
  \ vehicle appears on our way, as if it arrived from another era: a man, seated on\
  \ top of the mountain of hay he\u2019s carrying, is riding a horse that is hauling\
  \ a cart. I\u2019m on a travel through time. I feel that, comfortably seated in\
  \ my modern vehicle, I\u2019m looking to an ancient past, a life of farm and agriculture\
  \ that is passing near me, showing its fierce dignity. Still surprised we continue\
  \ and we randomly take other streets, until we arrive to a dead end. Before going\
  \ back, we catch a glimpse of a group of children, only dressed with shorts, that\
  \ are taking a bath in the river. The water is dirty, of a faint colour between\
  \ grey and brown, but they seem to enjoy a lot, screaming and laughing while jumping\
  \ from the riverbank into the water.\nWe finally find our coveted sea and spend\
  \ some hours on the beach. In the late afternoon, we are on the road again, for\
  \ reaching Tirana, the capital. An incredible delusion. The city appears hot and\
  \ crowded: people going everywhere, with any means of transport, shining storefronts,\
  \ illuminated signs, touristic restaurants with waiters trying to convince us to\
  \ stop: a sad nightmare. Sleeping appears to be the only solution: we find a hostel\
  \ and soon fall asleep. But in the morning, a surprise. The road behind our hostel,\
  \ that we are now walking, seems to be the one of a little and cosy village, not\
  \ of the enormous city we saw the night before. All along the street there is a\
  \ little open air market, mostly for fruit and vegetable: maybe just some small\
  \ apples in a basket, or a dozen of carrots, or a box of potatoes the sellers picked\
  \ up this morning from their garden. The effect is incredible: many people shouting\
  \ the prices of their products, trying to catch the attention of passers-by, a colourful\
  \ set of food neatly laying on the ground, old women all dressed in black seated\
  \ on the sidewalk for washing and cutting vegetable, a man weighing peaches on a\
  \ little portable scale. Once again, Albania offers us a look into a mysterious\
  \ and disappearing world, that seems to come from a far away past."
