Text: "My friend I made  practicing my Spanish one day at my host university\u2019\
  s cafeteria in Madrid. Spain sent me an invitation to visit the Rose Garden by the\
  \ Parque del Oeste with her while the flowers were in bloom. I was only happy to\
  \ oblige and take the extensive metro trip from my host family\u2019s apartment\
  \ to experience the view of the roses alongside my new friend who was also from\
  \ the states, Mary. Once I arrived at the actual park I was a bit overwhelmed to\
  \ find that the open space within the park was a lot larger than I was expecting.\
  \ So I decided to set forth and go about finding my destination. Unfortunately,\
  \ I basically got lost within the hills and valleys and many trees surrounding the\
  \ Parque del Oeste. Even though I felt disheartened not finding the garden immediately;\
  \ it made reaching my target location that much sweeter. The first area was full\
  \ of greenery and intriguing landmarks but the sight I beheld, at the actual Rose\
  \ Garden in Parque de la Montana, was my absolute favorite because of the alluring\
  \ set up with some artfully made arches with flowers and vines intertwined in them\
  \ as well as fountains and of course plenty of roses everywhere. It felt like walking\
  \ into a fairytale landscape seeing the arrangement of the flowers. It is a view\
  \ I will never forget and one I will always cherish as part of my time spent abroad\
  \ with a student visa."
