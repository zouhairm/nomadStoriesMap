Text: 'India is one of my favorite countries to me first time I heard about in 1997
  though amazing Bollywood movie called "Del to Bagal hai", since that time I was
  fascinated to visit India and exploring the culture of the country actually was
  my dream and I had doubt to achieve it. Year over year my passion to visit India
  never stopped till my friend Sara advised me to apply to ITEC scholarship which
  it sponsors by the government of India. Moreover, the scholarship covers everything
  from visa to accommodation to cultural trips, with no time I applied to the scholarship
  and for my surprise, I was selected, candidate.

  My dream finally come true! The scholarship was in Cybersecurity for around two
  months and was an unforgettable journey in my life.

  One of my unforgettable experience in my journey, when I was lost in New Delhi city
  my basic knowledge in Hindi language was fair good- learn it through Bollywood movies,
  I was lost for 5 hours and these hours made me see how incredible India is, in addition,
  it made me stronger and more confident person.

  I usually hear about mother India but now I believe in mother India. I hope to live
  the rest of my lifetime in India I''ll be blessed parson in the planet.'
