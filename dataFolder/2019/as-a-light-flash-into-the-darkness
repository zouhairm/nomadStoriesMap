Text: "I've never lived abroad, I've never lived alone. I've never hitchhiked, I've\
  \ never traveled with no back-way ticket flight. I've never slept in the forest,\
  \ I've never seen a moose. This is me two months ago, today instead, I can say I've\
  \ done all of these things, and more. It's November 11th, 2017 and for two months\
  \ my life completely changed. I still remember the doubts knocking on my brain,\
  \ while I was filling the application form. I can still feel the panic invading\
  \ me thinking back at the moment I've received the letter. See you soon. That was\
  \ the ending: see you soon. Double-click, I've booked a one-way ticket to Estonia.\
  \ Now, here I am, 2300 kilometers away from home. My life in Italy, my body in Estonia,\
  \ my mind...well, ready to roll. I knew it was going to be a real challenge for\
  \ me. I knew it so badly the only way to make it happen was not to think about it,\
  \ until the moment I would actually found myself into it. That's the way you make\
  \ great things happen to you, I do believe so. \n\nIn this very moment, I'm on the\
  \ passenger seat of a yellow truck rolling through the A5. Out there it's already\
  \ dark, as the winter daylight in Estonia happens to be a quick deal. I'm looking\
  \ out the window, and I can see how our truck represents a light flash into the\
  \ dark. One of the most unique characteristics about Estonia it is the following:\
  \ for a considerable part of the year, the country looks exactly like its flag.\
  \ It consists of three horizontal stripes: a white one, a black one and a blue one,\
  \ on a bottom-up overview. It is worth to say that 47% of its land is covered by\
  \ forests. This fact leads everyone to imagine how easy is to cross a forest driving\
  \ out of a city. Also, copious snowfalls are anything but rare during the cold Northern\
  \ winter. Ergo, here comes the flag-landscape: frosted snowy fields at the bottom,\
  \ the pitch-black of the forest in the middle, a bright blue sky at the top - due\
  \ to the mirrored snow. \n\nMy imagination is running and I find myself thinking\
  \ about the possibility that thousands of years ago a man has happened to watch\
  \ the forest from the window of a yellow truck and claimed: \"Hey, I've got an idea\
  \ for our flag!\". But then, I think about the students of the Association of the\
  \ University of Tartu, and also that thousands of years ago trucks didn't exist\
  \ yet...bummer! Anyway, as a matter of fact, several empires and armies have tried\
  \ in the course of history to conquer the small and green flat-lands country. History\
  \ also shows us that no-one ever succeeded in it. Right at this point, my imagination\
  \ leads to a thought: Estonia longs for the independence as much as its one million\
  \ inhabitants, and it pictures that on itself to make clear that the country is\
  \ unavoidably designed to be itself and nobody else's property. So, the first thing\
  \ you learn about Estonia is the attachment to the country, the respect of the tradition\
  \ and the care of the land. The forest has been the asset for the Estonian independence\
  \ during the Russian occupation, and now Estonians pay attention to preserve their\
  \ natural beauties. \n\nToday I have several more things to learn about this country\
  \ as my stay it's just at the beginning. Today I feel lucky thinking back at the\
  \ moment I've decided to give it a try. Today all my fears and all my doubts have\
  \ vanished, because my expectations of what I was going to find were far smaller\
  \ than what I've actually found. People used to say I was crazy for doing such a\
  \ leap into the unknown; when you're wondering in the dark you risk to lose your\
  \ way. I've taken my chance, and now I feel I am like the truck I'm sitting in:\
  \ a light flash rolling through the darkness. Everything to be discovered, everything\
  \ to be enlightened. Curiosity is my gasoline and I can say I'm on my way. I keep\
  \ my light on."
