Text: "That movement in nerves, that jolt on tongue, that power in his anamneses are\
  \ the feelings identical to one incited by the dance, food & music. Their presence\
  \ can always make you feel confident & pleasant, so eventually it became the need\
  \ of human to develop it, get dependent on & survive in their lifetime. It became\
  \ the medium of expressing their thoughts, devotion, desires, passion and their\
  \ relation to the nature, humanity & god, thus becoming a big part of their culture\
  \ & social cohesions. The difference in lifestyle of people since past has assisted\
  \ the regional & traditional variations of these things, as we can see and enjoy\
  \ it today and which infect has made it more compelling and delightful.\n\nIf you\
  \ are attached with atleast anyone of these, you will easily make connections in\
  \ any part of world. The same you can feel in Egypt, which is known to hold one\
  \ of ancient civilisations of world. A country where God has himself embraced the\
  \ land with \"The Nile\", which consequently became source of everything that exists\
  \ there, from giant pyramids to sweet Roz be Laban. The feel of the life comes into\
  \ you in such a way that one can just feel Egyptian past pass through them. It is\
  \ an experience in itself.\n\nGetting along with locals is as easy as buying the\
  \ best fish from the market, but only one should be aware enough of reaching the\
  \ right market through right chain of communication. It is simple ask for information\
  \ from them but be ready to also independently figure out that way yourself. If\
  \ one can try speaking Arabic with them, one can see the real colour of the person\
  \ in front of them, so if they are really willing to assist without any desires,\
  \ one will be able to see that on their face. Sharing a \"shy\", a cup of tea with\
  \ the locals plus \"Sheesha\", it will be a big honour for them.\n\nIn the southern\
  \ part of Egypt where you will find Nubian culture, struggled & evolved through\
  \ various dynasties has a very calming music made by Clarionet, Flute and \nTambourines\
  \ and a light dance form only performed in group & depicting their past in a proud\
  \ & cheerful way. In the lower Egypt(north) you can experience a completely different\
  \ but equally soothing music. It is much more provoked by the Arabian style of music,\
  \ which gives it a variant taste, one of them being Sufi style in which they follow\
  \ any Islamic mystical order which emphasises chanting and trances to attain unity\
  \ with God and their \ncharacterization on this in the form of dance is much more\
  \ powerful. The higher and heavy the chanting gets the more concentrated their performance\
  \ become. The melody is in their voice, specially when they make transition between\
  \ the notes. Other being the traditional \nform which has instruments similar to\
  \ that of the southern music in addition with \"Tablah\" (goblet drum) which is\
  \ used for beats and in fact models the dance of the low land Egypt performed on\
  \ this beats mainly by the man.\n\nIf you love eating, you\u2019ll find a wide variety\
  \ of food, good, fresh and in honest fare that  contains an occasional sensational\
  \ punch. Although it is not much diverse as you might find in Turkey, Pakistan or\
  \ in India but the simplicity and the collection of general food into one is its\
  \ asset which will surely attract you. Its speciality lies in its availability that\
  \ is you can always find a nice place for dinning maybe by the Nile or in old streets\
  \ of downtown and can consume it as breakfast, lunch or dinner anytime. Meals here\
  \ typically centre on stews and \nvegetables but the fishes can be found in large\
  \ variety and the meat is a kind of luxury. If you find a long line across a street\
  \ near a shop be sure that they serve either real nice koshari or the famous falafel(ta\u2019\
  amiyya) and shawarma if you ask them to serve in Suri (Syrian) stlye you might like\
  \ it much more."
