Text: "My mornings is an adventure for me everyday, the adventure of catching the\
  \ local train to work. Sometimes I am late, sometimes it is. Some people wait patiently\
  \ for the train on the platform, having arrived sufficiently in advance and busy\
  \ reading their morning paper, whilst others run helter-skelter looking totally\
  \ undignified, chasing down the train and giving a hand to the driver with pleading\
  \ eyes to miraculously stop. Oh, I am nothing less than our Usain bolt, running\
  \ at my top speed to catch the train!\nAnd what do I see from the train? \u2018\
  Incredible India\u2019 or \u2018Real India\u2019 \u2013 is it just a heap of garbage\
  \ and slums and smelly drains? Well, partly true but not only that! On some days,\
  \ it drizzles, and the running train leaves my face refreshingly splashed with a\
  \ feeling of a child \u2013 like happiness of getting drenched in the rain. On occasions,\
  \ a flock of birds race with the train in a sinewy path, dancing to the music playing\
  \ in your ears, with a peacock giving a guest appearance declaring its supremacy\
  \ on one of the rocks. As the train passes through the cemetery I can\u2019t but\
  \ help notice that the most flourishing and beautiful Gulmohar trees stands amidst\
  \ the buried ones, and what better example of afterlife! The breeze in my hair gives\
  \ a sense of freedom as I see the sun set gloriously, reminding me that it\u2019\
  s evening, and it is the favourite time of the day -  as a cup of ginger tea beckons\
  \ at home. \nIn the train, one meets all kinds of people. I often get irritated\
  \ by the chattering crowd, some of them seated on the floor blocking the door for\
  \ the breeze, but I also stumble upon kindness and humanity in the most unexpected\
  \ of places.\nOne such encounter that I observed was between an old, malnourished\
  \ woman sitting on the floor and a working-class, sharp-tongued lady having breakfast.\
  \ The elderly women just sat with a hunched back, forlornly looking at nothing and\
  \ no one. Out of nowhere, the other lady offered part of her breakfast which she\
  \ was eating which was one meagre looking dosa of which I could easily eat three\
  \ and still be hungry to the old woman. The transition in the elderly lady\u2019\
  s face was amazing, and from a defeated look, I saw a smile stretching from her\
  \ tired eyes right up to her over-ceased wrinkles. That day I learnt the power of\
  \ sharing.\nNot only in the train, but there are so many emotions to observe on\
  \ the platform. In the morning, a toddler with his father on the bike, waves a crying\
  \ goodbye to his working mother, not understanding why she must leave. The mother\
  \ keeps a strong smile with her goodbyes but you can see the affection in her eyes\
  \ that are affixed in their direction even when they are long out of sight, I see\
  \ people dropping their kids off to school with a happy face because they will get\
  \ a few moments of relief while the kids are away. but I wonder to see there transitional\
  \ emotions they were unsatisfied when they were not having kids and are unsatisfied\
  \ now that they cannot live their lives to the fullest, the way they used to when\
  \ they were unmarried.\nOr the young brother, who can\u2019t see her sister leave\
  \ him for school in the morning, or the couple who meets up in the evening at the\
  \ station and joyfully smile and wave as if it were an eternity since they last\
  \ met rather than just that morning.\nTrain journeys are an adventure, exhilarating\
  \ yet painful at the same time."
