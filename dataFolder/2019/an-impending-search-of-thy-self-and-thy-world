Text: "A young girl of 18, decided to embark on a journey to the unprecedented land\
  \ of the Great Pyramids - Egypt! In April 2018, I was selected for an AIESEC volunteer\
  \ program to Egypt. I was supposed to leave in a month for a mere self-exploration\
  \ cum volunteering program. However, little did I know, the journey would rather\
  \ escalate into an amalgamation of all three themes mentioned above: a leap into\
  \ the unknown, making a local connection and finding unexpected things. Even though,\
  \ I had travelled to South Africa for a Round-Square cultural exchange, this somehow\
  \ felt more challenging; more discerning. It felt as if I am leaping into the unknown.\
  \ However, curiousity - to unleash the hidden secrets - and ambivalence has always\
  \ been a dear friend to me. With that spirit in mind, I chose to travel with two\
  \ very dear amigos: Divya and ambivalence. Divya and I cherished a healthy friendship\
  \ of 5 years, and the trip is where it - the tulip of our friendship - started to\
  \ to unfold, and rather disparagingly, I would say. I didn\u2019t expect to find\
  \ the dark - but discerning - parts of our friendship, and unravelling deep-rooted\
  \ indifferences. Ambivalence, on the other hand, didn\u2019t disaapoint me. From\
  \ missing a bus and being stranded at the bus-stop at 11 in the night, to catching\
  \ hold of my own insecurities - Egypt was a bitter-sweet symphony. In India, I live\
  \ with my family: my father, grand-mother and my aunt, and am the only child. So,\
  \ going by what Alfred Adler\u2019s theory of birth-order talked of, I am deeply-attented\
  \ to, but ironically so, I am immensely independent, at the same time. Egypt, on\
  \ the other hand, was a major shift for me. I was expected to share a three-room\
  \ accomodation, having three beds each with 10 girls (yes, one extra!). I shared\
  \ my room with a girl from Pakistan and Ghana - named Manish and Michelle, respectively.\
  \ I have never personally identified myself as a religious person, and always that\
  \ of a spiritual one. Religion is a theory; its a prison, people fear to leave for\
  \ they are scared of the endlessless potential lying futile amidst the chaos of\
  \ the cosmos, waiting to be accepted. Egypt - and my room mate, Manish - taught\
  \ me a whole-lot things about Islam. It opened my eyes to a lot of things, and in\
  \ layman-terms: I gained exposure. As far as the work-front in considered, I was\
  \ working with refugee kids, aged 6-15, and was expected to teach them English.\
  \ Speaking of yet another lesson I learned: language. Human-kind is ashes without\
  \ language. Language is the trunk which holds the branches, fruits and leaves together.\
  \ And I was -abashedly- unaware of how integral Arabic is to the natives. I somehow\
  \ flapped myself out of the pool of unknown waters, everytime I went out to buy\
  \ the groceries or became adept at using sign-language while asking for the price\
  \ of the beautiful bag - for mind you, even the numbers were in Arabic. Egypt taught\
  \ me how mango shakes taste delicious without milk, and how wheat was just not a\
  \ part of their daily regime. People solely use milk from tetra-packs, which made\
  \ me realise the importance of being a Vegan! This way, I made a local connection\
  \ with the people of the city of Cairo, by being an equal part of the city-madness.\
  \ As cliche as this must be; but you do bump into several beings while on your journey\
  \ of life, and so did I. You see yourself in every human-being floating around this\
  \ conciousness, and so did I. I saw a part of my being in everyone: repulsiveness,\
  \ irritability, kindness, compassion. I also met an amazing human-being from Morocco\
  \ - Maria, and I still somehow feel an impending connection with her. Kezban, and\
  \ Chadah, were two more amazing people from Turkey and Tunisia, respectvely. This\
  \ is what my trip was all about - the little things, and surreal moments we involuntarily\
  \ close our eyes towards. I saw myself, and chose to attend to my insecurities and\
  \ relentlessly work on them. Amidst the chaos and madness of the city of Cairo,\
  \ I found myself, and that is the core essense of being - and that is my unsolicited\
  \ victory."
