Text: "Aldona is the most beautiful village in the world. How often do you hear the\
  \ whole village saying that? Wherever we went in Aldona and whoever we spoke to\
  \ \u2013 we heard only one thing \u2013 Aldona is the most beautiful village in\
  \ the world. Asking them, how many villages have you been to is not a valid question.\
  \ They are simply in love with Aldona. We spoke to a shopkeeper who makes savories,\
  \ we spoke to a pharmacist, we spoke to people who run lovely boutique hotels here\
  \ and we spoke to a recent resident here. Everyone had just one thing to tell us\
  \ \u2013 Aldona is the most beautiful village in the world.\n\nWell, I must admit\
  \ that a lot of literary giants are choosing to live in Aldona, so it must be true\
  \ that Aldona is the most beautiful village in the world.\nAldona Name origin:-\n\
  Aldona as per author Maria Aurora Couto, who is an Aldona resident, has its roots\
  \ in Haldi or Turmeric \u2013 a crop that was the planted here in this village.\
  \ As per another Aldona resident, we spoke to \u2013 it comes from the word \u2018\
  Hal\u2019 that in many Indian languages including Konkani means plough. He argued\
  \ that this is an agricultural village named after the agricultural instrument.\
  \ In the recorded history though it was called Haldona till Portuguese twist made\
  \ it Aldona.\nAldona has a population of 6000.\n\nSao Tome or St Thomas Church:-\n\
  Most villages in Goa have a church around which the village life is centered. It\
  \ may have been a temple before it was a church and some villages do have both a\
  \ church and a temple. In Aldona, it is the Sao Tome, a church built in 1596 CE\
  \ on a plateau next to Mapusa river. Whitewashed in pristine white standing in the\
  \ middle of greenery, Goan churches are always charming to look at and so is this\
  \ one.\n\nTale of three bridges & a fort:-\nAldona is flanked by two bridges across\
  \ the Mapusa River, that flows along the village.\nA small cable bridge connecting\
  \ Aldona to Corjuem across Mapusa is a lovely bridge to both observe and cross.\
  \ It is Goa\u2019s first cable bridge and hence very special for the two villages\
  \ that it connects. This is another reason for people of Aldona to say \u2018Aldona\
  \ is the most beautiful village in the world\u2019.\n\nAt sunset time, this bridge\
  \ is very picturesque, with the Mapusa flowing silently below it.\n\nCalvim Bridge:-\n\
  Calvim Bridge is built on a tragic story. 4 schoolgirls and two adults died while\
  \ crossing the river in Feb 2012 and that is when this bridge was commissioned.\
  \ The Plaque gives the names, dates of birth and photos of all these people and\
  \ the Calvim bridge is dedicated to them. But for this story, this would be just\
  \ another steel and cement structure connecting the two villages across a river.\
  \ To me, this was another great example of remembering the locals who lost their\
  \ lives in an accident. This is what makes Goa special.\n\nI was told that you get\
  \ lovely Samosas in the evening across the bridge and it is this Samosawala who\
  \ drives the maximum traffic on the bridge. What bridges can do \u2013 feed hungry\
  \ souls every evening with some tasty samosas?\n\nRamps\nInside the Corjuem fort,\
  \ the most intriguing feature is the four wide ramps in all four corners leading\
  \ to the roof that runs around the fort wall connecting the four ramps. I assume\
  \ that these ramps were meant to roll supplies of some kind or to take animals on\
  \ top. The rooms if any no longer exist. There is a well bang in the middle of the\
  \ courtyard. It almost feels like a mansion that belonged to some rich family. The\
  \ small size of Corjuem fort tells me that there is nothing much that could have\
  \ been guarded inside the fort. It may have been a place to keep an eye on the surroundings\
  \ and make sure that no invaders are coming through land or river route.\n\nA legend\
  \ says that a Portuguese female traveler by the name Ursula e Lancaster was traveling\
  \ around the world dressed as a man, as women could not travel on their own in those\
  \ days. However, when she reached Corjuem fort, she was caught and had to let go\
  \ of her incognito travels. Not sure how true this is, as when I asked the locals\
  \ about this story, they said \u2013 Who knows!. In Aldona, you can hear a new story\
  \ every evening. No wonder best-selling fiction writers love to live here."
