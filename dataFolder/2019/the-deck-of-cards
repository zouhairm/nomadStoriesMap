Text: "We had been in Nicaragua for more than a week. Our clinic was going well, and\
  \ people were comfortable seeing us hanging around the village. They took advantage\
  \ of the fact we were offering a service that otherwise their wouldn't have. Some\
  \ doctors, medicines, a few events for the kids. At the same time we were humbled\
  \ and grateful to learn so much about their customs and habits. Personally, I tried\
  \ to gain the most out of every encounter I had.\nOn the final day I saw this man\
  \ sitting on the ground with his back to the wall. He was resting. I decided to\
  \ sit next to him. He looked at me while I was finding my place on the ground and\
  \ then smiled. I smiled back.\nMy Spanish was decent enough to start a simple conversation,\
  \ so I went \"Como est\xE0 hoy?\". As I had already seen other times, the eyes of\
  \ the man became wide open when he realized I spoke Spanish. He was surprised. I\
  \ heard many people in the village referring to us like Gringos, not expecting anyone\
  \ to understand them. I always laughed when I was able to pick something like that\
  \ from their conversations.\nThe man then talked to me as if he was with a friend.\
  \ Obviously, I didn't expect him to make any effort and speak slower. That's why\
  \ I was happy like that. It made me feel part of the community. Listening to that\
  \ natural speech, I was able to notice the little linguistic nuances that Spanish\
  \ has in that region.\nI immediately found out his name was Armando. He told me\
  \ about his farm and started naming fruit I had never heard in my life. I didn't\
  \ interrupt him and I kept thinking that he was definitely using local names for\
  \ fruit. A mixture between Spanish and some kind of indigenous language. I started\
  \ getting more curious and decided to ask him more about life in that region. To\
  \ my surprise, instead of just talking about family Armando began a lecture on the\
  \ history of a civil war that happened all over Nicaragua no more than 30 years\
  \ before. A war I had never heard about and that was described in all its brutality\
  \ by new friend. Families were divided by it, with cousins or siblings fighting\
  \ and killing each other over a political idea. I was shocked and speechless. Armando\
  \ noticed that and he decided to invite me to his \"finca\". He wanted to show me\
  \ his farm and the products he grew. He didn't want me to associate Nicaragua only\
  \ with that memory of the civil war. I was touched by that invitation and told him\
  \ I was supposed to finish my shift at the clinic and that maybe another day I would\
  \ have been able to go visit him. He understood that and told me goodbye.\nBefore\
  \ leaving he also mentioned how two of his sons were having fun with the activities\
  \ we had organized at the clinic during the week we were there. I asked for their\
  \ names and he told me they were Miguel and Manuel. For the second time in a few\
  \ minutes I was deeply moved by his words. This time because those two kids had\
  \ spent hours playing cards with me during the whole week. I showed them some of\
  \ my card tricks and they taught me some of their card games. We had had a lot of\
  \ fun together and once I heard they were Armando's children I decided I had to\
  \ do something before leaving the village.\nWhen I went back to our \"charla\",\
  \ where the kids were playing, I took Miguel and Manuel to the side. I told them\
  \ how much fun I had had with them during those days and that I had decided to give\
  \ them a little present as a sign of our friendship. I took one of the deck of cards\
  \ we had used and gave it to them. I also told them to say hi to Armando once they\
  \ would get home. Their eyes brightened once they understood their dad and I were\
  \ friends. Then, we all went home happy."
