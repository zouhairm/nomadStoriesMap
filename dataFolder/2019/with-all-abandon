Text: "This past week, our class took a day trip to Brigantine Beach. Though Fall\
  \ is here and city life is getting chilly in Philadelphia, it was incredibly gorgeous\
  \ that day in Atlantic City with its clear blue skies, bird formations, white sands\
  \ and ocean waves lapping rhythmically against the shore.\n\tUpon arrival to the\
  \ beach, my movement teacher Sarah immediately raced me to the ocean and I ran joyously\
  \ with as much recklessness and abandon that I never thought I had, that I haven\u2019\
  t had in a long time.\n\tBut of course, I was wrong about that\u2014the Pig Iron\
  \ Theatre Company always pushes the limits of what you thought was possible a lot\
  \ further.\n\tAs a class exercise, we all partnered up and in each partnering, one\
  \ person would escort the other blindfolded anywhere on the beach.\n\tWhen it was\
  \ my turn to close my eyes, I immediately experienced largeness as my perceived\
  \ constraints of space disappeared. My eardrums suddenly boomed with crashing ocean\
  \ waves. I felt the sloppy wet sand alongside seashells and stray pebbles, which\
  \ my feet pressed gingerly against. Most revealingly, I discovered my breath again\
  \ and again as I have so many times in class and in life, but with the addition\
  \ of having lungs that expanded ten times larger its original size in response,\
  \ I think, to the vastness of the ocean, to the endless supply of salty breezes\
  \ engulfing everyone nearby.\n\tIt was then I learned that the ocean, in its vastness,\
  \ invites bigness.\n\tIt makes the compulsion to just run, dance, leap and splash\
  \ absolutely natural here. And so we did. Michael even threw Francesca into the\
  \ ocean!\n\tYet the ocean brought to my conscious awareness a greater sensitivity\
  \ to my surroundings as well. It was surprisingly easy, for example, to recognize\
  \ my classmates apart without sight\u2014from Ilse\u2019s laugh to Nick\u2019s hands\
  \ to Michael\u2019s kiss on my forehead.\n\tI felt largely at ease too. Adeline\
  \ took watch for me as I blindly walked along the shorelines. Strangely enough,\
  \ the more I trusted my partner, the more curious I was for the space around me\
  \ and the more exploratory I became. It was quite freeing. I then concluded that\
  \ what I\u2019m learning from this exercise is the importance of human connection.\
  \ That within companionship, there exists an affirmation of the self, a greater\
  \ realization of yourself and more fun risk-taking.\n\tQuinn, our school\u2019s\
  \ director, came along and coaxed me into another run towards the ocean. I had the\
  \ lucky chance of doing this before with Sarah eyes opened, but now with eyes closed,\
  \ I felt even a greater, more complete freedom. I swear I never ran that fast in\
  \ my life. In fact, I think I have been too careful for most of my life. Careful\
  \ of knocking things over, of intruding other people\u2019s personal spaces, of\
  \ taking appropriate cues within varied social circles. Yet for once, I didn\u2019\
  t have to worry. I didn\u2019t doubt. There was no restraint, only great abandon.\
  \ My heart leapt and I ran with it.\n\tAnd gosh, does the heart run fast."
