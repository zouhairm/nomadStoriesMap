Text: "That first real trip is crucial.\n\nWhen, for the first time, you travel further\
  \ than Grandma\u2019s house in Eclectic, Alabama. When the road becomes exotic,\
  \ not only in destination but in composition, asphalt giving way to concrete, then\
  \ to cobblestone, or to sand-swept hardpack. When the familiar southern drawl loses\
  \ its cadence, slipping from a Tennessee twang to the rounder sounds of a South\
  \ Carolina conversation, and then on to thicker, wilder accents, leading inexorably\
  \ on to unintelligible foreign tongues that leave you grasping for recognizable\
  \ words.\n\nThat first true step into the unknown either makes or breaks a world\
  \ traveler. The feeling of being alone, out of place, uniquely foreign when you\
  \ have lived your whole life up to that point in a sea of familiarity and predictability\
  \ is either something to be loathed, or it\u2019s something to be loved.\n\nMy first\
  \ trip further than Grandma\u2019s house (yes, there really is an Eclectic, Alabama)\
  \ was about as far from my hometown in rural Tennessee as possible. Geographically,\
  \ culturally, ideologically, you can\u2019t get more radically different than Riyadh,\
  \ Saudi Arabia.\n\nPlus, it was the summer between my seventh and eighth-grade years.\
  \ I was shy, short, awkward, and mercilessly bullied. But I was also uncommonly\
  \ self-aware for a teenager. I figured a few years in the desert would be the perfect\
  \ opportunity for self-reinvention. So I set out to do just that.\n\nAnd, in the\
  \ process, I fell in love with Saudi Arabia and the wider world. I embraced the\
  \ strangeness of every new place. I reveled in the uncertainty of the road, welcomed\
  \ the flood of foreign dialects, learned to love not only the destinations but also\
  \ the journeys themselves.\n\nSo, this is why I travel. For the possibility of continual\
  \ self-improvement through exposure and experience. For the thrill of learning the\
  \ hitherto unknown. For the chance of channelling that awkward teenager that I was\
  \ and showing him that the world is still wide, wild, and ever-expanding.\n\nFor\
  \ the beautiful agony of knowing that every journey taken inevitably creates endless\
  \ roads that still need to be traveled. And, although it is impossible to travel\
  \ them all, that is exactly what I aim to do."
