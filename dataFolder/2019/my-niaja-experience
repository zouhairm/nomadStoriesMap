Text: "I landed in Lagos and adjusted to my new schedule. I was still working remotely\
  \ so I used the CCHUB as a workspace. I learnt about White House food Bukka (Street\
  \ restaurant) and also Afropolitan, which was an event that happened every 3rd friday\
  \ of the week and attracted young people at Marina in the heart of Lagos. They have\
  \ this great roasted fish and plantain which you have to try.I also got to hang\
  \ out with some new & old friends where we went to a resort in Lekki, lagos called\
  \ Lekki Leisure Lake. This was a really nice place to relax and unwind and suits\
  \ the active person as there is a beach as well as a small lake with activities\
  \ like Jet Skiing, Paddle Boating, \nLekki Leisure LakeI did not have to wait long\
  \ for my first trip after safely landing in Nigeria as I had to fly to Kaduna to\
  \ go see my mother who lives there. My parents don't live together so while my family\
  \ lives in Lagos, my beautiful mother lives in the city of Kaduna in the north-western\
  \ part of Nigeria. My 3 sisters and my half-sister also kind of all got married\
  \ there so family galore there. I was excited to see my mum and sisters but also\
  \ really looking forward to meeting my 4 nieces and nephew as the last time I was\
  \ in Nigeria, I only had 2 Nieces.Getting To Kaduna\n\n\n\n\n\nSshes and saw some\
  \ young rural girls that got pretty frightened and maybe thought I was chasing them.\
  \ I did ask them if there was a road and they said hell no. I then took the normal\
  \ road and got into Jos. Jos had one problem, a lot of road checkpoints. Like way\
  \ too many of them. Also the road wasn\u2019t the best. However as soon as you get\
  \ to Bauchi state, the road is a blessing but watch out for the speed bumps which\
  \ are placed at the entry point of every village or town. There is a specific road\
  \ in Bauchi between 2 rocks that is just omg and I actually took pictures while\
  \ driving at high speed, don\u2019t try that please I am a trained idiot. Once again\
  \ on entering Bauchi, I had my Jovago booking awaiting me and it was a great choice\
  \ actually. We decided we were going to go the the famous Yankari Game reserve where\
  \ wild animals live in the wild but the rain had other plans and we had to cancel\
  \ our safari.\nHighlight\n\nWe took a new route and google maps was there to show\
  \ us. I did stop by to buy roadside potatoes as a gift for my uncle in Jos. If you\
  \ haven\u2019t tried Jos potatoes, you are missing out. We also stopped for a small\
  \ fix done on the car which took around a half hour. The Jos road blocks were just\
  \ too much and yes oh yes we had to Roger one or 2 people, as I was driving a tinted\
  \ vehicle and even thought I had the paperwork they just wanted to waste our time.The\
  \ highlight of my trip was my trip from Bauchi to Abuja via Kafanchan. I was with\
  \ a travel partner from my friend\u2019s house called Jo that hitchhiked. \n\n\n\
  We were blown away by how beautiful our own Nigeria was. When we got to Kafanchan,\
  \ I did stop by to pray and I could remember seeing a diverse market with Yoruba\u2019\
  s, Igbos and Hausas co existing. It was beautiful and this is what you would see\
  \ when you travel. People in Nigeria love each other and yes there are some trouble\
  \ makers but there are more good people. We got to Abuja around 7:30 pm making it\
  \ around a 7.5-hour trip including stops and repairs.I got to do so much in this\
  \ trip yet I had so much more undone. My advice to you all is travel more within\
  \ Nigeria. It is a beautiful place. We need to patronise our own country or else\
  \ who will? It is beautiful and when I return I will do more. Peace"
