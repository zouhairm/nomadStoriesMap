Text: "I had difficult childhood. Not anything unusual. Two parents that constantly\
  \ complained about money issues and how bad Latvian government is. Or only vacation\
  \ was going to the big super market to get groceries for the rest of the week. \n\
  \nIn the geography class we usually watched videos about other cultures nature and\
  \ their people. It amazed me. I constantly told my parents that traveling is a ''must''\
  \ thing to do. And their reply was - first get rich and then you could think about\
  \ the traveling opportunity. It sat in my mind for the longest time. you now how\
  \ they say ''your parents are always right'', right?   I sat with this idea in my\
  \ head for more than 5 years. Then came college years, with so many students across\
  \ all world. I was surprised and curious, - how can they do that? Be so free-spirited\
  \ and combine two things education + traveling? I digged deeper on my university\
  \ website. And there it was - The exchange program. I applied without any hesitation.\
  \ They picked me My next destination - Hungary. The wine and goulash nation, probably\
  \ two things that will save the world in the future. I was pumped! You will asked\
  \ me how my parents reacted? They didn't believe that this kind of option even excited.\
  \ I packed my bags and when for adventure for 5 months. BEST 5 months on my life,\
  \ even though i had a couple of doubts on the way. It was all worth it. \nThe people\
  \ I met, the places i saw and most importantly the FOOD that i tried. uh bring me\
  \ back. please! \n\nPeople usually ask how traveling affect you, did it changed\
  \ you in any way?\n\nThe answer is YES, you find your happiness in different nation.\
  \  The people ..more like the family you meet abroad is worth more than a thousands\
  \ of dollars. Now im back in Latvia. ready for more adventure.  NEXT STOP ? \n\n\
  Memories and details may fade, but we never forget how the place made us feel."
