Text: "Hello I'm coming from Bandung, Indonesia. I student in General Achmad Yani\
  \ University, the major is International Relations Department. Now, I'm on my last\
  \ year and will be graduate soon. I wanna tell the story when I'm traveling with\
  \ my brother 5 years ago, anyway you can call me Tao that is my nickname.\nSo, 5\
  \ years ago I was graduated from senior high school and my brother tell me \"how\
  \ we celebrate your graduate with traveling, you can learn something new and this\
  \ is good to get stressed out\" my answer is YES! \nAfter that, I with my brother\
  \ create plan and choose destination, and we choosing going to Karmun Java Island\
  \ in Indonesia, the trip will be need 1 week. 2 days on bus and 5 days on the island.\
  \ I really can't wait for D-Day! Because when I planning this with brother I'm on\
  \ preparation for exam to university.\nSo, D-day is coming. me with my brother going\
  \ to bus stasion with track Bandung-Jepara with 1 night on the bus we sleep and\
  \ eating on the bus and sleep again until we arrived on Jepara Bus Station. From\
  \ Jepara Bus Station we must wait boat ready to the island. After all, we arrived\
  \ on Karimun Java Island (sorry because on the express boat I just sleep hehe) and\
  \ then when we arrived on the dock, we going with a car to the hotel. But the hotel\
  \ is not with a good or special  service but, we just stay with local community\
  \ and the local community will beour friend until next 4 days.\nDay-1 we on the\
  \ Island, we going to the middle of the sea with little boat to see beautiful natural\
  \ under the sea. Yes, we do snorkeling with the other on the boat, I can see how\
  \ the beatiful fish like Nemo on the movie. THIS IS FUN !\nAfter that, night will\
  \ come to us and we going back to the island to take a bath and get some dinner.\
  \ After that, me and my brother going to the central Island on the night. In there\
  \ is like a marketplace or traditional food station, yeah we hungry again hahaha.\
  \ So when we wait our food, we talk to the locak and ask all about the island, the\
  \ island is didn't have electricity on the morning after afternoon but when night\
  \ come electricity will turn on, so if you want to charge your phone or battery\
  \ of camera you can charge on 06.00 pm until 06.00 am. This island have little airport\
  \ for little plane, if you have a lot money yes you can using a little plane to\
  \ here. Finally our food come, and this is time to eating. My food is meatball from\

  \ again and after that we doing some party and barbeque with the other stranger.\
  \ Oh yes you can find baby shark in here. Don't worry, baby shark in here will be\
  \ nice is didn't like on the movie make us scary. The key is, if you didn't have\
  \ a blood on your skin the shark will be kind. In this day we full snorkling to\

  \ our last day on the island. Because we must going back to home as soon as possible\
  \ because my brother have a call from his officee to get back work. So, this day\
  \ we didn't snorkling again, we just walk around on the island and watch sunset\
  \ with drink cocounut on our hand. Ah a beautiful life,\nAnd the day we must going\
  \ back to home using a ship and a bus again to our home. Ah so sad to leave this\
  \ island, maybe someday I can going back to the island. So if you are visit Indonesia\
  \ don't forget to visit this island. \nSee you again."
