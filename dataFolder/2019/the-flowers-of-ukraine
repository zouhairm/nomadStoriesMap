Text: "I have the biggest crush on Ukraine.\_\n\nI visited there a few years ago and\
  \ from the moment I stepped off the plane I felt like I was in a fairy tale. Sure\
  \ there were soldiers with serious looking guns but there were also infatuated fanboys\
  \ and girls with offerings to their superstar gods and goddesses.\_\n\nMost poignant\
  \ of these was the fresh-faced beau in a black leather jacket. He was caught in\
  \ the metamorphosis of trying to shed his his boyhood and become the perfect man,\
  \ without really knowing what that was yet. He still had that beautiful milky clear\
  \ complexion, those rosebud lips, the gorgeous grey eyes that hadn't yet learned\
  \ to flatten to steel but he also had the swagger and stance of a tough guy. And\
  \ he was holding a bouquet of at least two dozen, stunning, long stemmed roses.\
  \ I forget that girls aren't the only ones that believe in fairy tale love.\n\n\
  I love flowers and flowers were everywhere in Kyiv. It was partly because it was\
  \ spring but it had to be more than that. At every subway entrance there were grannies\
  \ selling posies. The men wore flowered shirts. Not the loud Hawaiian shirts that\
  \ I know from the States but lavender button ups blooming with irises or t-shirts\
  \ crowded with daisies. There were bouquets in the bathrooms. Tender spring shoots\
  \ were coming up in tiny ersatz greenhouses made of 2 liter soda bottles that had\
  \ been planted in tiny patches of dirt. Professional women walking to work had sprays\
  \ of flowers to adorn their desks. For a gardener like me it was soul satisfying.\_\
  \n\nSince I have returned from my trip, I keep an eye out for any mention of things\
  \ Ukrainian, feeling like I am twelve again and am putting up posters in my bedroom\
  \ of Sean Cassidy.\_\n\nThis morning I ran across an article about Ukrainian flower\
  \ crowns and their role in separating Ukraine from Russia. It took me back to the\
  \ day I spent in the Ukrainian National Botanic Garden.\n\nThe garden was huge.\
  \ It had brand new Japanese Gardens. It had the most beautiful espalier gardens\
  \ I have ever seen. Even better than Monet's. There were formal rose gardens and\
  \ brides everywhere getting their photos taken. There were forests with magical\
  \ looking birdhouses. And the ubiquitous flowers seemed to be hostess, guide and\
  \ traveling companions.\n\nI noticed a grandmotherly type plaiting little white\
  \ flowers from the weeds into a crown. There was nothing more I wanted at that moment\
  \ than for her to teach me how to make them. It was also when I discovered that\
  \ \"smiling\" at a stranger in Ukraine is a very subtle thing. \n\nSmiling in Ukraine\
  \ is verboten. So I simply softened my face. I was rewarded with the tiniest of\
  \ smiles, more of a deepening of her wrinkles. I felt like I had just won the Nobel\
  \ Peace Prize or something and it was all I could do to stop myself from jumping\
  \ in the air with a very American fist pump and yelling \"YES!!!!!\"\n\nOf course\
  \ all I could do was walk away with the memory of this tucked away in the library\
  \ of my heart."
