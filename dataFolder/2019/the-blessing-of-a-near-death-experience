Text: "My family and I are making our way to Salvador when the blue sky and blazing\
  \ sun announce the second day of our road trip to Salvador, Bahia. From the car\u2019\
  s backseat, my 12 years-old version observes how quickly the landscape changes.\
  \ The houses and stores of the country town we slept last night gives place for\
  \ the green of the vegetation. A light breeze invites the tree leaves to dance.\
  \ A few hours later, majestic mountains rise before our eyes. Our car is the only\
  \ one zigzagging the road curves.\nI love to contemplate nature. There is always\
  \ something magical and mind-blowing to see. Something that feeds my soul and gives\
  \ me inner peace. Even though I am sleepy, I keep my eyes wide open. You never know\
  \ what they can register. You never know which surprises are waiting for you.\n\
  My aunt is trying to calm down my four-year-old cousin. While driving, my uncle\
  \ talks to us, but I am not really paying attention. The radio is playing a past\
  \ decade hit when our vehicle skids. There is sand on the track, so my uncle lost\
  \ control of the car. I am scared to death. My heart beats like a drum, I shut my\
  \ eyes, tightly. A wave of fear floods each centimeter of my body while we get closer\
  \ to a ravine. \nTravel is always a meeting with yourself, a different place or\
  \ people. When I left Rio \u2013 the city where I was born and raised \u2013, I\
  \ just expected to watch my cousin Vinicius\u2019 fight in a Judo Championship.\
  \ I expect to explore Salvador and know more about the city where my ancestors lived\
  \ and created memories. I expected to meet the uncle who I only know by the weekend\
  \ phone calls. \nWhat I could never imagine is that death would like to say hello\
  \ to me.\nI bow my head and pray. What else can I do in this situation? I mutter\
  \ every single prayer I know, waiting for some divine entity to set us free of our\
  \ imminent accident. I think it works because, in the next second, my uncle regains\
  \ control of the car and moves us away from the abyss.\nWe all sigh in relief. My\
  \ family starts complaining about the lack of road signs but I just thanks Heaven\
  \ for staying alive. Nature frightened me but gave me another chance to live a fulfilling\
  \ life as well. It gave me another chance to spread love and appreciate the blessings\
  \ I receive every day. It gave me another chance to be happy.\nIn Salvador, I watch\
  \ the Judo Championship. I talk to my uncle and take a photo of us. I walk by the\
  \ historical streets and ride a ferryboat. At the end of the day, my almost death\
  \ experience made my trip more special. Travel can teach us a lot. Especially when\
  \ we allow ourselves to simply enjoy the journey."
