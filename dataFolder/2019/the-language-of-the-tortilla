Text: "The smell wasn\u2019t quite like anything I\u2019d experienced before. The\
  \ blend of island humidity, salt air, a fresh cup of almost-too-strong coffee, and\
  \ tortillas quickly crisping up over the fire wasn\u2019t something you\u2019d find\
  \ in a Yankee Candle, but in that moment, there wasn\u2019t anything missing. Isabella\
  \ had been rolling out the dough for a few minutes when I walked up from the beach,\
  \ snorkel, fins, and camera in hand. In that distinctive Belizean Garifuna accent,\
  \ she beckoned me over, flour trailing from her fingertips like a ghost\u2019s hand\
  \ waving through the air. \n\nGhost or not, Isabella was a living portrait of earlier\
  \ days, weather-worn skin under a small straw hat, calloused hands, a faded button-down\
  \ shirt and loose blue jeans. One part cowboy, one part grandmother, she was the\
  \ caretaker of the island research station I had crawled back onto after a day diving\
  \ on the reef. Her sons ran the ferry, her husband fished beyond the reef crest,\
  \ and Isabella handled the rest. Though she\u2019d seen both British colonial rule\
  \ and an independent Belize, there was no doubt on that island that you were in\
  \ Isabella\u2019s kingdom. \n\nI dropped my wet gear at the door, brushed the sand\
  \ and the salt away as best I could, and sat down on the stool next to the fire\
  \ pit as the queen tended her tortillas. English may be the official language of\
  \ Belize, but language itself was too rigid a term to describe the way we communicated\
  \ on Isabella\u2019s island. Whispers of Kriol, Garifuna, English, and Spanish rode\
  \ the breezes around our little kingdom. The language of sea spoke of plenty and\
  \ peril. The language of the trees spoke of stifling heat and life-bringing storms.\
  \ In that cabana, with the wind and the tide singing their songs around us, Isabella\
  \ was teaching me the language of the tortilla. Silently we sat there, rolling the\
  \ dough, stoking the fire, flipping the fruit of our labors. \n\nHolding my wrists\
  \ in her fingers, Isabella pressed my hands into the dough as we listened for air\
  \ pockets and felt the resistance, softening at first, and then suddenly returning.\
  \ Spreading out the dough into the round form that even I could recognize, we felt\
  \ for just the right amount of give, and reached for more of the ghostly flour as\
  \ the dough stuck to both our hands and the table. We listened for the sizzle of\
  \ the infant tortilla bursting into our world as we dropped it on the cast iron\
  \ over the fire, smelling the rich, smoky aroma of flour crisping and dough baking\
  \ to life. \n\nStill now, it\u2019s a challenge to put into words how these simple\
  \ round treats told us they were ready. In a way, they were worlds unto themselves,\
  \ with a geography and a language all their own. In the moment, under the guidance\
  \ of Isabella, their language was translated through soft sounds and rich smells,\
  \ and just like that, we knew. \n\nIsabella didn\u2019t know much of my spoken language,\
  \ and I certainly knew very little of hers. We sat in mostly silence, little more\
  \ than smiles and helping hands exchanged between us.  But that silence made way\
  \ for something different. I listened to the sound of the breeze, and how it spoke\
  \ to the fire. I listened to the sound of the sea and how it spoke to the sand.\
  \ More than anything I listened to the sound of the tortillas, a language that a\
  \ part of me already knew, but one that Isabella taught me how to hear.\n\nLife\
  \ is a web of these incredible connections. We all have our stories, and we all\
  \ have our languages. But connecting each of them are these common tongues, too\
  \ often hidden from us. The wind, the sea, the fire. They all speak in ways that\
  \ connect us. From island kingdoms off the coast of Belize to classrooms back home,\
  \ these connections are out there. Sometimes, all it takes is a little bit of silence,\
  \ and a couple dozen tortillas to show us where they are."
