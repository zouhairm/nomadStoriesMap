Text: "Stumbling through Tokyo\n\nIt was our last night in Tokyo \u2013 a Saturday.\
  \ We were staying in a quiet part of the city, cut off from the chaos. It would\
  \ have been around midnight when my friend Billy and I set out. The plan was simple:\
  \ to walk until we eventually came across something worth stopping for. \nWe didn\u2019\
  t have a destination in mind. It was a step-at-a-time arrangement. The first temptation\
  \ to stop that we came across, quite fittingly, was a red-light district. More subdued\
  \ than your usual prostitution hub, this red light district was eerily quiet and\
  \ all but devoid of people \u2013 not a single swearing drunk to be found. From\
  \ the street, the brothels looked like hotel lobbies, clean and business-like, sometimes\
  \ with a man in a suit by the door, though more often without. There was usually\
  \ a sign out front with prices, like the display menu for a restaurant. \nThe sinister\
  \ nature of it all was not lost on Billy and me. We kept on.\n\nThere were long\
  \ stretches of dark and empty streets on our journey to nowhere. We sung gibberish\
  \ back and forth \u2013 rambling rhymes that didn\u2019t make sense. In Brisbane\
  \ we weren\u2019t smokers, but in Tokyo, well, they were just so cheap. Plus, you\
  \ could smoke inside. How could you not? \n\nWe were lured eventually to the soft\
  \ yellow light of a bar. There was quiet chatter inside, laughing. We tossed up\
  \ going inside. The place was small and quaint, like a little cottage. We were unsure\
  \ of the etiquette; we\u2019d have felt like pests just barging in. The owner and\
  \ chef, apparently having picked up on our uncertainty, stepped out onto the street\
  \ and waved us in. It was warm inside, homely. Barely the size of a living room,\
  \ there were nine stools around the bar. Billy and I took the only two remaining\
  \ seats, smack bang in the middle of everything. Sitting down, I could feel the\
  \ walls of the small joint pressed in close around us. The first thing we did was\
  \ order beer. \n\nDirectly to our right was an elderly woman with white hair who\
  \ always had a cigarette between her fingers. Next to her there was a man and woman\
  \ in their late-20s or early 30s. They seemed like a couple. The woman was drunk,\
  \ going on piss drunk. All night the elderly woman kept calling her a whore. It\
  \ was in a friendly way, or at least I think it was. In any case the three spoke\
  \ to each other as if they were family. \n\nOn our left were four kids around our\
  \ age \u2013 two boys and two girls. They were in a rock and roll band together.\
  \ Conversation was hard at first, though we got used to it soon enough. In the end\
  \ we all got on well. We shared food and drink and traded songs back and forth.\
  \ We spoke in gestures and laughed at everything. The lack of a common tongue felt\
  \ irrelevant. For one fleeting night they were some of our closest friends.\nThe\
  \ sun was coming up when we left. Two of the rock and rollers came out onto the\
  \ street with us to say goodbye. We ended up waving to each other for some hundred\
  \ or so metres as we walked away. \n\nWe were still lost \u2013 not that it was\
  \ an issue. We just picked a direction and walked for a while until we found a train\
  \ station. From there, getting home was nothing."
