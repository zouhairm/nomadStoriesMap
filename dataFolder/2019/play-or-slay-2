Text: "Play or Slay.\nDissolving generations of conflicts with a generous dose of\
  \ playfulness.\n\n\u201CSo, is this not how you celebrate New Year\u2019s in your\
  \ country?\u201D A friendly Sri Lankan man asked me as I watched a bunch of half-naked\
  \ men slather oil on each other much like a mechanic would on his spare parts: rehearsed,\
  \ mundane and with abandon. At a distance a tall pole made of the native Puwak tree\
  \ was being greased diligently by some locals. \nWitnessing a pole climbing contest\
  \ was a first for me. I watched the aforementioned men shimmy their way up to the\
  \ top only to slide back down again, or being dragged down by a fellow participant\
  \ who decided to use his comrade as a ladder. It was as though the pole had conspired\
  \ against them but the hilarity of the situation made up for the many failed attempts.\
  \ With every climb and every fall, the men laughed and the audience cheered them\
  \ on. I glanced at my new friend and gestured encouragingly for him to partake.\
  \ He laughed and handed me a king coconut. Together, we raised a toast to their\
  \ bravery. \nMy new friend\u2019s name was Chintaka, Chintaka Thantramudalige (referred\
  \ to from now on as C.T). I learned that he had lived all of his thirty years in\
  \ Sri Lanka, through the civil war and the tsunamis. As we walked away from the\
  \ pole climbers who by now looked like crabs trapped in a barrel, C.T narrated stories\
  \ of the civil war with anecdotes from his childhood. \u201CSee those houses dotting\
  \ the periphery of the ground? If you look closer you will find bullet holes on\
  \ the walls, roof tiles missing, windows cracked and broken. Once you know, you\
  \ cannot stop noticing these things. For 25 years, the Sinhalese and the Tamils\
  \ fought over this land. Now, in the very same land, we play ridiculous games to\
  \ celebrate every New Year that comes.\u201D \nBattleground turned into a playground,\
  \ I liked that. I thought to myself how bizarre this Sri Lankan New Year experience\
  \ has been as I followed C.T to the main event, a Pillow fight. Yes, a pillow fight.\
  \ Except, in this case the pillows were denim sacks that were being generously stuffed\
  \ with cotton and there was no bed to fight on. Instead, there was a precarious\
  \ bamboo structure. A long horizontal pole which was supported by two triangular\
  \ frames on either side, raised five feet off the ground. \nThis was a serious event\
  \ as the grand prize was a brand-new scooter that the whole village had chipped\
  \ in for. The boys of the hour mounted the bamboo structure. And as fate had it,\
  \ one of them was Sinhalese and the other was Tamil. They were ready for war, but\
  \ this time around the weapon of choice was a \u2018pillow\u2019 or something like\
  \ it. \nThe whistle blew off and the two boys let fly their denim sacks. The first\
  \ strike landed on the target\u2019s head, concussion assured, but the young blood\
  \ was not bothered by such minor setbacks. After several blows were hurled back\
  \ and forth, interrupted with fits of laughter and heckling, one of them landed\
  \ a thunderous blow that made his opponent take off from the pole and land into\
  \ a puddle of muddy goop. That sealed the match and the winner was indisputable.\
  \ The two boys laughed silly as one of them scraped some blood of his forehead.\n\
  The crowd was quick to shuffle away from the location and the judge disappeared\
  \ to bring the winner his prize. At that moment I realized that these celebrations\
  \ were perfect moments of human expression. That after 25 years of war, the country\
  \ found its New Year spirit in playing pillow fights and other games that would\
  \ probably never make it to the Olympics but by doing so it allows for ridiculousness\
  \ to exist in a society and that is sadly not how we celebrate New years back in\
  \ my country.\nBy now, the scooter had arrived and the boy took his then opponent,\
  \ now friend for the first ride, probably to the nearby clinic."
