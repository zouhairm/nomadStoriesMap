Text: "On the first day of spring, I set off on foot, leaving the Andalusian city\
  \ of Seville in the South of Spain. I don't know exactly what I was hoping to find.\
  \ Clarity, maybe. Faith, maybe. Or possibly just time to process the difficult year\
  \ I had just survived. I do know that I had spent countless hours researching, dreaming\
  \ and waiting for the day that I could embark on my first Camino.\n\nI walked on\
  \ the Via de la Plata, a pilgrimage path that runs from south to north through the\
  \ heart of Spain. It follows an old Roman road and ends in the city of Santiago\
  \ de Compostela, where the tomb of Saint James is said to lay. \n\nI walked quickly\
  \ and with purpose on that first day. My backpack was too full. It would be few\
  \ days before I would begin leaving unnecessary items behind. The sun was strong,\
  \ the heat contradicted the rainy forecast. I passed a shanty village not far from\
  \ the city. There were feral dogs skulking between the garbage and the rusty corrugated\
  \ metal shacks. \n\nFor more than fifteen kilometers I did not see a single person.\
  \ I walked in silence. The soft \"tup tup tup\" of my steps on the dusty path lulled\
  \ me into an unexpected state of meditation.\n\nShortly before the path diverged\
  \ to meet up with the highway I saw another pilgrim. He looked to be about seventy,\
  \ gray and slightly stooped over. He walked with a jerking movement. As I caught\
  \ up to him I called out \"Buen Camino!\". He turned back and shaded his eyes with\
  \ his hands before shouting back \"Buen Camino!\". I jogged towards him. \n\nAs\
  \ we walked he told me he would only be walking half a Camino this year as he was\
  \ slower than most pilgrims. He had Parkinson's Disease. He told me planned to walk\
  \ a portion of the Camino every year until he could not walk anymore. We walked\
  \ the remaining five kilometers together and arrived at the first day's destination\
  \ just in time for tapas and a cold glass of beer. \n\nDays later I would meet five\
  \ French women all in their eighties. I couldn't help but admiring them and hoped\
  \ that this would be what I'd be like at eighty. They seemed fearless and surefooted.\
  \ Sure, they walked slower than some of younger pilgrims, but they forded the streams,\
  \ climbed the rocky paths, and didn't get as many blisters. One of the women came\
  \ to be known affectionately as \"The Doctor\", she helped thread the giant painful\
  \ blisters that had crippled some of the less experienced pilgrims. \n\nPatience.\
  \ Slowing down. Finding the beauty in the moment. Listening to my body. Accepting\
  \ the kindness of others. Letting go of the material stuff that was literally weighing\
  \ me down. Appreciating the simplest of pleasures; a shared orange, the glass of\
  \ wine at lunch, a hot shower. These were the lessons I would actually learn. The\
  \ Camino softened me. The Camino ignited the spark of adventure within me. It renewed\
  \ my faith in humans.\n\nThe Characters of the Camino. Those in mid-life, sorting\
  \ out their crisis'. The widows. Those who enjoy the challenge of attempting marathon\
  \ style distances and speeds. The lifers, practically homeless, or actually homeless;\
  \ who lived on the path, begged in the towns and who slept underneath the stars.\
  \ The priests. The nuns. Those who came to find God. Those looking for love. The\
  \ nature lovers. The convicts. Those like me who are just a little bit lost.\n\n\
  \"Buen Camino\" to everyone I've had the privilege to meet on the way. Those words\
  \ are both a prayer and a kind of spirited \"You can do this!\". As I sit here in\
  \ the cold of a Canadian winter reminiscing, I remember the words one kind Spanish\
  \ man said to me:\n\n\"Cuando decimos que el Camino es como nuestra propia vida,\
  \ deberiamos decir que la vida es come el Camino, ya que nuestra vida es una permanente\
  \ peregrinacion.\"\n\n\"When we say the Camino is like our own life, we should say\
  \ that our life is like the Camino, since our life is an ongoing pilgrimage.\""
