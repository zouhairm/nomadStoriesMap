Text: "Both me and Noori, an Afghanistan young man (23) who was also an asylum seeker,\
  \ did not expect any extraordinary thing as we traveled to Barendorf, Germany, to\
  \ attend Ankunft bis Zukunft (ABZ). ABZ was a workshop about refugees, held in April\
  \ 2017.\n\nNoori went there from L\xFCneburg because his friends asked him, while\
  \ I, who was an exchange student from Indonesia, went there from my stay in S\xFC\
  dergellersen due to the pros and cons about asylum seekers and refugees which are\
  \ so vigorous in Europe, especially in Germany.\n\nWhy does humanity have to fight\
  \ with the interests of a country?\n\nUnexpectedly, I found more than just an answer\
  \ there; I found myself and Noori becoming the incarnation of Emma Stone and Ryan\
  \ Gosling\u2014or better, Mia and Sebastian\u2014in a movie which got six Oscars\
  \ in Oscar 2017: La La Land. \n\nIt all started when Noori caught me playing the\
  \ piano in music room. I was lonesome and it was quiet there, but the atmosphere\
  \ changed swiftly as he entered the room with a smile. I clearly remember a thing:\
  \ he has dimples in both of his cheeks, deep and alluring. \n\nI stopped my piano\
  \ play in order to respect his presence, but he forbad me. His German sounded stiff\
  \ when he said, \u201CPlay it again, Rani.\u201D\n\nMy fingers then moved above\
  \ the piano keys.\n\nCity of stars, are you shining just for me?\nCity of stars,\
  \ there is so much that I can\u2019t see\u2026\n\nI know that German people are\
  \ known by their frankness. Stereotype. Noori is indeed coming from Afghanistan,\
  \ but he has been lived in Norddeutschland for two years. This might explain why\
  \ he praised me with, \u201CSince I first met you in the hall this morning, I know\
  \ that you are different.\u201D \n\nI chuckled. \u201CThank you.\u201D\n\nWe were\
  \ in the middle of having chit chat when he abruptly gave me an idea to tell each\
  \ other about our life. I agreed without thinking.\n\nThis tall and dark-haired\
  \ man told me about his family that he left, Afghanistan which was (and still is)\
  \ in ruins, and his journey to Germany which went rough; he once walked along the\
  \ mountain for three days, with fear and without stop.\n\nMe, I told him about my\
  \ family whom settle in the inland of Sulawesi, a stranger who thought that I am\
  \ a refugee due to my physical look and veil that covering my head, and a subject\
  \ in school called Politik und Wirtschaft. That subject was one of the reason why\
  \ I was there, trying to answer my own questions.\n\n\u201CWow,\u201D he said. \u201C\
  Have you found the answers that you\u2019ve been searching for?\u201D\n\n\u201C\
  Not yet.\u201D\n\nI tried to explain how difficult it was to digest information\
  \ about who was right and who was wrong, mentioning Angela Merkel\u2019s policy\
  \ to \u201Copen\u201D the Germany\u2019s border in 2015. \u201CCountries have the\
  \ right to reject the presence of someone whom is considered illegal, but I think\
  \ no one is illegal. We are all the same.\u201D\n\nNoori pressed three piano keys\
  \ idly. Do, sol, la. \u201CI think, there will be no answer about who is wrong and\
  \ who is right.\u201D\n\n\u201CWarum?\u201D Why?\n\n\u201CIt depends on your perspective,\u201D\
  \ said Noori. \u201CAnd your heart.\u201D\n\nI was in silence after I realized:\
  \ he was right. \n\nCity of stars, are you shining just for us?\n\n.\n\nAfter ABZ\
  \ workshop, Noori and I got closer. We started as a friend, and then changed into\
  \ best friend, and then we changed again. \n\nI turned into the woman that he was\
  \ in love with. \n\nUnfortunately, love and relationship were out of my reach. My\
  \ journey in Germany was about to end, and I needed to go back to Indonesia; to\
  \ a man that I longed to be in his arms, to a man that was my home.\n\nCity of stars,\
  \ are you really shining just for us?"
