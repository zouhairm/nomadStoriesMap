Text: "\u201CLook out!\u201D Joe yanks me aside to dodge two oncoming motorbikes and\
  \ a honking tuk-tuk. We then leap over uneven bricks in the pavement and side step\
  \ a rickshaw before dashing through the dense fog toward New Delhi Station. The\
  \ stench of defecation is overwhelming as we hurry up the concrete stairs splattered\
  \ with dark stains. A blur of dark figures saunter past, coughing and spitting onto\
  \ the ground. I shudder and tighten my cashmere shawl around me.\n\u201CWe just\
  \ need to get to Varanasi,\u201D I reassure myself, \u201CAll the guidebooks claim\
  \ this spiritual city is the Heart of India, it will be better there.\u201D We dart\
  \ along the crowded platform and dive into the last of the faded blue carriages.\
  \ Panting, I look around at where we are to spend our next 18 hours. Six steel bunk\
  \ beds hanging by chains are arranged in a U-shape. A large blanket-covered lump\
  \ already occupies one. The LED light flickers dully, and the window shutters are\
  \ tightly shut. Wincing, I climb the grimy ladder to my bunk, fingertips lightly\
  \ touching the rungs, and then reluctantly recline on the encrusted steel. A whistle\
  \ blows and three burly men wearing black beanies scramble onto our cabin in the\
  \ nick of time and squish onto the vacant bed below me. The train lurches forward.\
  \ As we gain speed, the carriage rumbles loudly in protest and the walls start trembling.\
  \ Clang! Clang! Clang! A thin man paces up and down our cabin banging his steel\
  \ thermos continually shouting \u201CChai?! Chai?!\u201D, unfazed that no one is\
  \ paying him any attention. Holding back tears, I shut my eyes, trying to block\
  \ out my surroundings. Somehow, amid the racket, I doze off. \nSome time later I\
  \ awaken, shivering, and realize the Chai man has gone and Joe is asleep. I hear\
  \ giggling, and then three small children crawl out from under a blanket and climb\
  \ like cheeky monkeys up to the vacant bunk above them, play wrestling and grinning\
  \ over at me. A proud man strolls out from the adjacent compartment, ruffles the\
  \ hair of one child, and pushes the window shutter open, letting sunlight pour in.\
  \ He notices me shaking and passes me the now spare blanket, which I gladly accept.\
  \ I tell him of my desire to get to Varanasi. He tells me of his family. He is travelling\
  \ with his children and brother who cannot speak. He gestures to the doorway and\
  \ a timid man with wide eyes shuffles in and sits by the window. He reminisces over\
  \ their childhood spent playing cricket then pauses thoughtfully, tells me to keep\
  \ the blanket, then returns to his cabin.\nJoe has awoken and we decide its time\
  \ to eat. The men with beanies notice our sad lunch of leftover peanut brittle and\
  \ a packet of tomato-flavored crisps and share with us their dates, biscuits, and\
  \ chevda, a spicy mix of dried ingredients. They pull down the tray in between the\
  \ bunks and invite us for a game of cards. They teach us Satte Pe Satta, a strategy\
  \ game to lose all your cards, and we play for hours, chatting and laughing. The\
  \ Chai man from earlier returns and we each enjoy a chai. \nDaylight is fading.\
  \ Growing tired, my eyes drift toward the window where I meet the gaze of the timid\
  \ man. With a toothless grin he beckons me over. I sit with him and he offers me\
  \ a tray of assorted sweets. Apprehensively, I pick a pink jelly looking one and\
  \ pop it in my mouth. It slides down like sugary goop with a random crunch in the\
  \ middle. I smile gratefully. I rest my cheek against the cool slimy wall and we\
  \ sit in a comfortable silence, gazing out the window. I lightly tune in to the\
  \ boys chatter and hear them explain to Joe the Hindu concept Atithi Devo Bhava\
  \ or \u2018the guest is equivalent to God\u2019, meaning to welcome visitors with\
  \ enthusiasm and pleasure. I smile to myself, thinking about how the day turned\
  \ out.\nTogether the timid man and I watch the sun descend until the train wearily\
  \ slows to its last stop. \u201CHere we are!\u201D announces Joe, \u201CThe Heart\
  \ of India.\u201D"
