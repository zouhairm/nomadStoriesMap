Text: "\u201CBut did you have to go somewhere on the complete opposite side of the\
  \ world?\u201D This very statement left my father\u2019s concerned lips and my fell\
  \ softy on my relentless ears. \u201CYes dad\u2026I need this.\u201D I decided to\
  \ make the journey to the one place I knew was the furthest away from my home. Thailand.\
  \ In Thai language, Prathet Thai, which means \u201CLand of the Free.\u201D Exactly\
  \ 24-hour time zone difference. I wanted to feel free.\n\nI needed this. \n\nI have\
  \ traveled before, but nothing like this. A spiritual travel, one doused with purpose\
  \ and fueled by a desire to change the world somewhere else if I could not here.\
  \ \n\nThailand, a country known for pad Thai, elephants, and Buddhas. Bustling streets\
  \ loaded with scooters. Sun-kissed skin and jet-black hair, Thai people. Street\
  \ merchants pressing their hands together and lowering their heads to express their\
  \ gratefulness to you and the world while whispering \u201Csat-wat-dee-ka\u201D\
  . \u201CHello\u201D I would respond, timidly, while mimicking the pressed hands\
  \ gesture back. I always thought of myself as thankful, blessed, so I longed for\
  \ an environment that mirrored the selfless ways I lived my life every day. I wanted\
  \ to volunteer my time back to a country who always stood for what they believed\
  \ in. Who singlehandedly created a culture open to gratitude and receiving life\
  \ back from the world. And I envied that. \n\nAmerican culture has us fooled for\
  \ what we should truly be thankful for.\n\nThen I met Dao (\u201Cda\u201D). Her\
  \ name means star. She is an 8-year-old Thai girl, who lives on the island of Koh\
  \ Samui, who shared her pink strawberry popsicle with me. \u201CYou do not have\
  \ one, why?\u201D She asked, speaking clear but broken English. Dao attends a public\
  \ school on the island where she learned at the local school my volunteer group\
  \ was teaching English at for the day. \u201CNo, no\u201D I replied. \u201CYou eat\
  \ it, it is yours.\u201D \u201CYou can have one, here.\u201D Dao\u2019s hand, covered\
  \ in a gluey pink coating, reached out and put the other half of her popsicle in\
  \ my hand. \u201CNow we are both happy\u201D, she said.\n\nI never realized how\
  \ just then, as little of an amount she had in her hand, my happiness was more important\
  \ to her than having the popsicle. I melted, faster than that popsicle did in the\
  \ 92-degree weather Thailand was having that day. \n\nI followed Dao to her playground\
  \ area. The area was painted underwater themed. English words scribbled next to\
  \ the sea life creatures as a way to practice. The swings were worn truck tires\
  \ with rusted chains, the slides had no metal piece to slide down on, they were\
  \ just spray-painted yellow frames. Dao fled towards the slide frames and began\
  \ to climb them. \u201CThis will be our first slide. I can\u2019t wait! I have never\
  \ been down one like this before\u201D I sat in complete awe, my eyes widened, and\
  \ then they watered. How was she able to look past the construction and shambles\
  \ in front of her and appreciate what has yet to come? \n\nWe opted for the sandpit\
  \ and we began to draw pictures. I drew a heart first, she followed with a butterfly.\
  \ I then drew a happy face, and she drew a tree. I asked her if she knew how to\
  \ say what she has drawn in English. She shook her head no. \u201CDao, you know\
  \ what this is! You are surrounded by them!\u201D I spread my arms out wide as I\
  \ inhaled the smell of the trees, the sound of the laughter from other children,\
  \ the warmth of the sun hugging me back. \n\nDao giggled and responded, with a soft\
  \ grin, \u201Cone\u2026.two\u2026..tree!\u201D We both laughed, and I hugged her.\
  \ The bell rang out for their mid-afternoon prayers. This was also signaling the\
  \ volunteers that we were finished for the day.\n\n\u201CDao, you have so much to\
  \ see in this world. You are very bright, and I know you will go far in life.\u201D\
  \n\n\u201CBut I am already happy here\u201D, as she held on to her heart.\n\nIt\
  \ was then I realized, I cannot control the world or what has yet to come. \nJust\
  \ what\u2019s inside of me."
