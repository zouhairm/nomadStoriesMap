Text: "This is my experience while I was attending a seminar in Bhutan, one of the\
  \ countries at the foot of the Himalayas. It was my third visit to the country,\
  \ which is known with its GNH (Gross National Happiness) concept. But unlike my\
  \ first and second visits, in which I fully involved in scientific seminars and\
  \ spent my time in sharing knowledge and engaged in discussions with the other participants,\
  \ during my third visit I interacted more with the local people because the program\
  \ from the Kyoto University, which organized the seminar, encouraged us to do so.\n\
  The most interesting experience for me was when we had the opportunity to have lunch\
  \ in the house of a local inhabitant at Punakha. Like other developing countries,\
  \ Bhutan faces the problem of urbanization. The young people left their villages\
  \ to look for work in the cities. So the government of Bhutan makes My Gakidh Village\
  \ Program, in which the villagers were encouraged to become young entrepreneurs\
  \ by exploiting wisely the surrounding environment, for example by establishing\
  \ home-stays and restaurants.\nWe were given a chance to experience the My Gakidh\
  \ Village program at a village in Punakha. We had lunch at a villager\u2019s house,\
  \ who opens a home-stay. They are used to welcome guests, both to stay or to have\
  \ lunch or dinner. As a government-fostered house, it is equipped with adequate\
  \ facilities to service guests like clean toilet according to the government\u2019\
  s standard. Like other traditional houses in Bhutan, this one was made of wood and\
  \ was built on stilts. A wooden stair led us into the house, while the toilet is\
  \ located under the house. It has two main rooms: family room that also serves as\
  \ guest room and a kitchen that is also the dining room. Bedrooms are located at\
  \ the right and left sides of the main rooms. We dined by sitting on the floor of\
  \ a simple but spacious family room, which can accommodate thirty people. The Bhutanese\
  \ love their king; therefore it is unsurprising to see a photograph of the King\
  \ and the Royal Family in this room.\nThe owner of this house is a sixty-year old\
  \ mother of three. Her eldest son works as a salesperson and travels a lot to various\
  \ cities and countries. He is the one who convinced her to make their house into\
  \ a home-stay. The owner told us that her husband had passed away and her children\
  \ stay in the city to study. To overcome her loneliness, she agreed to open a home-stay,\
  \ which provides her sufficient income. The occupancy rate of the home-stay is unpredictable,\
  \ but she is happy with the opportunity to meet and talk with people from various\
  \ countries with different cultures. While she told her story, the food came one\
  \ by one. The staple food of the Bhutanese is rice, especially red rice. The other\
  \ dishes are usually vegetables cooked with cheese. Most of the Bhutanese are vegetarians,\
  \ but it does not mean that there are no meats in their menu. Poultry, beef, and\
  \ pork are imported from India, because the Bhutanese do not slaughter animals,\
  \ probably due their religion. Almost 99% of Bhutanese are Buddhists.\nThe organizer\
  \ knows that one of the program\u2019s participants, which is I, is a Moslem. So\
  \ the foods being served were all vegetarian dishes. Even the oil used is vegetable\
  \ oil. The Bhutanese love cheese. Almost all of their dishes have cheese as one\
  \ of the ingredients. A typical Bhutan foos is emadatshe, which is a condiment made\
  \ of jalape\xF1o pepper cooked with yak cheese. Its hot and savory taste is suitable\
  \ for Indonesian taste. Bhutanese dishes are commonly hot, although not as hot as\
  \ Indonesian sambals. They are spicy enough for those not used to hot and spicy\
  \ food. Much of the other foods are fried. Some are very similar to Indonesian snacks,\
  \ which are shredded vegetables fried in batter and friend bananas. The lunch is\
  \ ended with dessert, which is rather sour yellow apricots the size of mangosteens.\
  \ That was my fascinating lunch experience at the house of a villager in Bhutan."
