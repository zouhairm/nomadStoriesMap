Text: "Sedona, Arizona is renowned as a haven for all things \u201Cnew age.\u201D\
  \ Tourists flock there from everywhere to connect with the ancient spiritual traditions\
  \ of the Native Americans of the region. Psychics and shamans of all sorts abound,\
  \ along with crystal purveyors, expensive yoga retreats and even the occasional\
  \ UFO sighting. Among these new age enthusiasts, there is a subculture of hikers\
  \ and campers who speak of energy \u201Cvortexes\u201D in the area, supposedly ancient\
  \ sacred spaces which somehow connect to the larger natural forces of the cosmos.\n\
  \tRob and I and his two dogs had arrived in the area to do some hiking among the\
  \ red rock cliffs of Oak Creek Canyon, which are considered some of the most beautiful\
  \ in the American Southwest. When it came to the vortexes, we brought open minds\
  \ tempered by a healthy skepticism. Through some local hikers we found an isolated\
  \ trail reputed to have excellent views of the surrounding landscape. The ancient\
  \ landscape here was astoundingly beautiful, possessing a solemn, sacred air that\
  \ seemed to resonate with the history and energy of millennia of continuous habitation.\n\
  \tShortly along our way we came to what looked like an ancient trail snaking upward\
  \ along the cliff walls toward the canyon rim. It was overgrown, but there were\
  \ enough traces left to follow. The route led us up the side of the steep canyon\
  \ walls and rewarded us with breathtakingly beautiful views. \n\tAfter rounding\
  \ a narrow bend high in the cliff wall, we found ourselves in a strange space. We\
  \ could sense a change in the air; a heaviness, an increased density which lent\
  \ a feeling of foreboding bordering on fear. It seemed as though there was a presence\
  \ nearby, a powerful, almost sinister emanation. The air grew dark and unusually\
  \ humid for this typically dry climate. The vegetation seemed to curl inward, almost\
  \ smothering, forming a dank pocket of shadow in an otherwise radiant place. It\
  \ was as if we had entered a cave, and there was a distinct feeling that something\
  \ else was in the space with us, something alive.\n\tThe dogs frantically sniffed\
  \ the air, growling and whining in a very unsettling manner. The whole place felt\
  \ thick with a tension that I did not recognize and yet felt instinctively familiar.\
  \ It was as if death were hanging in the air all around us. And then in a particularly\
  \ shadowy corner I noticed a rather large pile of animal bones, stripped free of\
  \ all flesh. Faded brown blood stains spotted the earth around the pile. The smell\
  \ of cat urine permeated the air, more pungent and intense than I had ever smelled.\
  \ Rob and I exchanged a look of urgent recognition. We had wandered into a mountain\
  \ lion's den, and it was instantly obvious that we should not linger. \n\tWe turned\
  \ and started furiously back down the trail, nearly dragging the dogs as they barked\
  \ and snarled in the direction of the den. As we skidded down the narrow trail,\
  \ suddenly a blood curdling scream rang out, echoing through the canyon with an\
  \ otherworldly resonance, as if coming from all directions at once. It seemed the\
  \ owner of the den had become aware of our intrusion, and did not sound pleased.\
  \ The terrifying sound sent us sprinting down the trail at a breakneck pace, narrowly\
  \ avoiding a deadly fall from the steep cliffs. Eventually we all made it to safety.\n\
  \tLater we reckoned that if we had come face to face with the mountain lion, the\
  \ dogs would surely have tried to protect us, as their instincts drove them to do\
  \ at the den. Rob and I would likely have made it out, but one or both of the dogs\
  \ would probably have been killed or seriously wounded in the ensuing struggle.\
  \  \n\tWe were lucky. We had not encountered a vortex that day, but we had wandered\
  \ into a strange and threatening place where we had no business being, narrowly\
  \ escaping without harm. I have hiked around Sedona many times since. I have still\
  \ never encountered a vortex, as far as I can tell, and I have been fortunate enough\
  \ to never have wandered into another lion's den either."
