Text: "It was the first day of my first ever solo trip. My first big trip, all on\
  \ my own and without my family, who had been my travel buddies until then. I was\
  \ in a great mood, excited for what the upcoming month had in store for me. \nAfter\
  \ I arrived in Amsterdam and dropped off my bags at the hostel, I ventured out to\
  \ explore the city. I wasn\u2019t scared of what I would find, I was excited. \n\
  The weather was absolutely beautiful that afternoon. The sky was blue and the sunlight\
  \ made everything seem brighter and made it vibrate with colour. The sun always\
  \ makes me happy, but that day there was something new mixed into that feeling.\
  \ It was the feeling of freedom. I could do whatever I wanted. I could go wherever\
  \ I wanted. No more classes, no more exams. Since starting university almost a year\
  \ ago, I did not get a decent break, there was always something to do for the future.\
  \ But not anymore. This was the sweet taste of freedom. \nAs I wandered around the\
  \ city, I noticed so many little things, more than I could count. The shape of a\
  \ door, the tree on a terrace on the top of a house, all the bikes in the streets\
  \ and the boats that drove past me in the canals. I noticed all the sounds around\
  \ me. The sound of traffic in the busier streets, the sound of the trams and all\
  \ the tourists and artists who put on shows in Dam square and the vast sound of\
  \ the water and people talking in the quieter streets. Everything was different\
  \ and new and exciting. Of course I had seen pictures of Amsterdam before and therefore\
  \ at least kind of new what to expect, but being there and experiencing it live\
  \ instead of through a screen was a whole different feeling. \nThat was my first\
  \ afternoon of travelling solo. After just a few days I got used to this new kind\
  \ of freedom. I may not have acknowledged it that much anymore as I did on that\
  \ one day at the beginning of September, but I still enjoyed it. Now, looking back,\
  \ I am starting to realise how much my life at home is predestined, almost like\
  \ it\u2019s set in stone. It doesn\u2019t just come from my university, but also\
  \ from within me. At home I would never just get up early in the morning with nothing\
  \ to do and go out and explore the city. I never thought about doing that before.\
  \ Living somewhere is so much different from just visiting a place. I like my life\
  \ and the city I live in, but sometimes I feel trapped and I don\u2019t even realise\
  \ it. Maybe that\u2019s the reason why I\u2019m always excited to leave and explore\
  \ a new, unknown place and get a taste of freedom."
