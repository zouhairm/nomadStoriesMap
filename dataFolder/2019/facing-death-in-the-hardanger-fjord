Text: "Have you ever had a brush with death? Like, looked it in the eye and begged\
  \ it to let you live? Or witnessed a near-death moment for someone else? Yeah. Today\
  \ was that day.\n\nIt started innocently enough; a slow wake-up, breakfast, double\
  \ checking the weather because it was cloudy, and it was supposed to be clear, piling\
  \ into the van and being driven up the mountain, and starting the day in awe of\
  \ the beauty of Hardangerfjord. \n\nWe started hiking above the clouds. Incredible!\
  \ Clear blue skies above the white clouds below, frost mixed with soggy, muddy trails\
  \ and enthusiastic about the climb to the summit. \n\nIt was beautiful for the first\
  \ 800 meters. And then it started to suck. A lot. Each summit we reached, there\
  \ was yet another to climb. I was tired when we reached the scramble up rocks with\
  \ nothing to stop you from slipping and sliding to your death. \n\nI almost gave\
  \ up then. I honestly considered it. I only continued because I was the last one\
  \ and no one would hear me if I yelled over the wind at the top of the mountain\
  \ and I had no idea how to safely turn myself around. But I dreaded the thought\
  \ of having to come back down this rock face. \n\nI wondered if I could call a helicopter\
  \ and what it would cost. Not even kidding.\n\nI saw one of the views I had admired\
  \ from the bus window on my arrival day. We could see a glacier in the distance.\
  \ You could see mountain after mountain after mountain. It was awesome! And a part\
  \ of me would have rather froze to death than face climbing down those rocks on\
  \ the way down.\n\nWhich is a contributing factor to the incident. \n\nThere was\
  \ a trail that descended in another direction. We walked that way, to check out\
  \ the view better and seek out the trail markings; red painted circles. They seemed\
  \ to go down the back side of the mountain and we weren\u2019t sure if they circled\
  \ around or continued in another direction. Would it take too long? Is there another\
  \ trail?\n\nAnd this is when, as my friend says, groups of people make stupid choices.\
  \ \n\nWe saw a potential trail down but couldn\u2019t tell from the top how steep\
  \ it was. Barbara volunteered to go part way down to check it out, and we would\
  \ follow if it looked good or she would climb back up if it didn\u2019t look passable.\
  \ \n\nThis is where the music changes in the movies and you know bad things are\
  \ about to happen.\n\n\u201CI\u2019ll take a look!\u201D she offered cheerfully.\
  \ And then she took one step that landed on the ice and she slipped off the top\
  \ of the mountain, falling several feet down, her fall only stopping because she\
  \ hit the side of a large rock face and grabbed at everything around her to keep\
  \ herself there. \n\nThis would be when in the movies you\u2019re yelling, \u201C\
  Stop! This is a sign that this is a terrible idea!\u201D \n\nBut stopping is not\
  \ what happened. Instead, everything happened at high speed, starting with that\
  \ fateful step. That step I saw happen just before it happened because I could see\
  \ the ice while standing next to her and she didn\u2019t see it as she surveyed\
  \ the possible trail below. \n\nWhat did happen, is several decisions were made\
  \ while all of us where in a state of shock and with adrenaline pulsing through\
  \ our veins. \n\nShe assured us she was fine, though we\u2019re all sure that was\
  \ a mix of shock, adrenaline, embarrassment, pride and NYC confidence and she continued\
  \ down, \u201CI\u2019m already this far,\u201D with a nervous giggle and a shrug.\
  \ Once at the bottom, WAY down at the bottom, she indicated it was an alright option.\
  \ \n\nSo, in turn, we all made our way down.\n\nWe should have pulled her up and\
  \ went back on the marked path. I mean, this is how people get injured, lost or\
  \ die. But with a few choice expletives, we began the scramble down the cliff."
