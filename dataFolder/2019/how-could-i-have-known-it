Text: "Have you ever felt a light breeze that gently messes up your hair, or a familiar\
  \ scent of a freshly baked carrot pie (Latvian traditional food)? All of this reminds\
  \ me of my hometown..\nIt's a small village, with a small amount of people. But\
  \ that's what I loved about it - everybody knows everything about everyone. As I\
  \ got older it starter to feel smaller and smaller, and I knew that it was time\
  \ to broaden my horizons. I wanted to see what else is out there other than the\
  \ place I was sort of stuck in. That was the start for my love of traveling.\nIt\
  \ was a rough night. I was turning in my bed not able to find a comfortable position.\
  \ I think I must have imagined everything that could happen during the week to come.\
  \ I was full of excitement and it felt like the time had stopped. When the morning\
  \ came I knew it would be an amazing day, because it was time to go to the airport\
  \ and fly to Hurghad, Egypt.\nStepping out of the plain I felt like the happiest\
  \ person in the world. I thought that nothing could be better than this. I felt\
  \ the sun warming up my skin and a rustle everywhere around me. I thought that this\
  \ was paradise on earth. If only I had known what I was going to face.\nWe decided\
  \ that we wanted to see the desert and how the local people lived. I was imagining\
  \ small houses and everyone wearing African jewellery and colorful outfits. That\
  \ was not the reality. The things that I saw forever changed the way I look at things\
  \ now. We were driving for a while and  when we arrived at the village the first\
  \ thing that I remember seeing were the house like tents that they called home.\
  \ They were small and really close to one another. People were walking around almost\
  \ naked and barefooted. They were so thin and fragile. I couldn't believe my eyes,\
  \ that in the 21 century someone could live like that. And if I thought that  was\
  \ a culture shock, I should have prepared myself for what I was about to see next.\
  \ \nWalking around I felt a familiar smell in the air, that reminded me of home.\
  \ It smelled of a freshly baked bread and I was already imagining it in my head.\
  \ When I walked closer to the bonfire I realized that there was no firewood, instead\
  \ they used camel excrement to cook there meals. At that moment I was in shock,\
  \ I almost forgot how to blink. I had never heard such a thing. As I was processing\
  \ my surprise someone started to gently shrug me by my shirt. When I looked down\
  \ I saw a small happy boy that offered me to try this bread. Of course I agreed.\
  \ It wasn't bad, but the idea of how it was made, made me a bit anxious. At this\
  \ point I felt so shocked about everything that I forgot to actually open my eyes\
  \ and see. \nPutting aside all the hunger and poverty, the we're actually happy.\
  \ How could I have missed this? They where dancing and laughing and talking in their\
  \ language, by the way they looked at one another, I could tell that they didn't\
  \ care about the material world. All that they needed was each other.\nAs I was\
  \ making my way back to the jeep my mind was spinning. How could I have judged them\
  \ in my mind? I don't even know them. On this trip I imagined seeing beautiful animals\
  \ and a wonderful scenery, but I didn't know that I would be given an opportunity\
  \ to see how the local people lived. I didn't expect to find this huge contrast\
  \ between two cultures. Despite the fact how they live, they were totally and utterly\
  \ happy, and I knew I wanted to see what else the world could show me."
