Text: 'Utah,Idaho ,Wyoming, Montana, Nevada, Arizona and California. 7 states in 3
  months, what an experience.....

  My started in Provo Utah, where I lived most of my days. The city it appears to
  be small, a university town. The surroundings are breathtaking. I went for hikes
  in the beautiful mountains. You should think about going there. I also took a chance
  to see Yellowstone park, that''s where my big road trip started, long straight highways,
  infinite skyes. I could perceive something different. It was a strong sensation
  of freedom and beauty. I drove all the way up to idaho, I saw several potatoes fields,
  that''s where the best chips in the world come from right? After seeing Idaho I
  enjoyed driving through Montana and Wyoming. As soon as I reached Yellowstone park
  I took a bear tour armed with courage and pepper spray. What a beautiful place.....

  I then spent thanksgiving in San Diego California, what can I say? California is
  a paradise on earth, it has fantastic coasts and cold ocean water, oh and yes perfect
  weather as it hardly rains. I finished my trip in warm Arizona, the land of cactus.
  Had some fantastic burgers and delicious tex mex food. Usa was the trip I always
  dreamed of, the trip of my life.'
