Text: "I would enter Ethiopia through Assad, the same place my father had entered\
  \ 37 years ago. My 18 years old father in the distant 1982, I was 30. He, as a private\
  \ of a dying war, crossed the Atlantic on a Russian ship; he crossed the Strait\
  \ of Gibraltar and the Suez Canal with a youthful yearning joy of adventure. I was\
  \ driven by a different motivation, determined to follow in his footsteps through\
  \ a country to which many ties of blood bind me. The route of both, from Assad (which\
  \ today belongs to Eritrea) to Dire Dawa. In his luggage: a few items of clothes,\
  \ ammunition, canned meat cans. In my backpack the ammunition replaced by a copy\
  \ of Pedro P\xE1ramo; but I was not looking for my father, I was hoping to find\
  \ my sister.\nThe war had broken in 1978 Somalia intended to occupy part of the\
  \ Ethiopian territory. Every place where the sheeps were white with a black head,\
  \ belonged to the Somalis, they said. The war was joined by Russia and Cuba, in\
  \ support of Ethiopia. And there were Cuban teenagers, dragged by a fight they did\
  \ not understand. \nMy father arrived in Jijiga in 1982. It was two years since\
  \ the worst of the war had passed. He had to learn the Amharic and deal with the\
  \ dust of the Ogaden desert. Thirty-seven years later I would arrive in the region\
  \ that, like Comala, gives off warmth in the afternoon that suspends everything\
  \ in memory. I must imagine that my father found a similar scenario: peasants who\
  \ come from nearby areas with camels loaded with various items. In the dusty streets\
  \ everyone promotes what they have to support their families. On both sides, the\
  \ kimbos look like Juan Rulfo\u2019s descriptions.\nIn the third tank battalion,\
  \ twelve kilometers from Jijiga, my father every Sunday designed strategies to escape\
  \ to the city. There he savored the areke and the angera. He was looking for the\
  \ warmth of arms that allowed him to remember his girlfriend. Four birr an hour\
  \ and he was paying for the pleasure and the risk of unknown diseases under the\
  \ feminine costumes. \nBeautiful women, I say to myself and my camera traps faces\
  \ burnt by the sun, skins with shades similar to mine, seductive bodies under the\
  \ vaporous fabric.\nMy father gave himself many times to love. It is difficult to\
  \ know in which meeting my sister was conceived. They were difficult times but love\
  \ united Cuba and Africa once again. In the sixteenth century from Africa to Cuba,\
  \ enslaved men and women, uniting the blood of torture to the blood of love. Then\
  \ my father and other men from Cuba to Africa, trying to mend the errors of history,\
  \ more blood of war and love. Now I, was joining the points.\nAtanachi, it's my\
  \ sister\u2019s name. I am 30 years old; she is 36 or maybe a little older. In 1984\
  \ my father returned to Cuba and never again stepped on Ethiopian soil. Last summer\
  \ we received a letter from Jijiga and we knew that she existed. Now I must embark\
  \ on the journey of reunion. My blood runs through the veins of an Ethiopian woman\
  \ and the blood forms indestructible bonds."
