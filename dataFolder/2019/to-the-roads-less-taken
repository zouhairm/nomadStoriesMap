Text: "It was one of those detours that had to happen!\n\nThe way I plan my travels\
  \ is peculiar because I believe not in scouting the web but a map. The least visited\
  \ place or the remotest island, is usually where I would like to see myself next.\
  \ \n\nKhuri village came up in a similar way. A short detour from Jaisalmer, Rajasthan,\
  \ India brought me to the land of what seemed to be just a vast desert plain. After\
  \ about a three-hour journey, past empty roads, twirling windmills, and endless\
  \ chatter of locals, I got off at a rickety path right next to a huge tree, the\
  \ shade of which was being used by the villagers to try their luck in a game of\
  \ cards. I asked around and was motioned to a bunch of homes down the broken road.\
  \ \n\nThat feeling of entering a countryside seeped in when I first saw a tiny shop\
  \ at a corner, selling nearly everything a household needs; yes, it even had a small\
  \ vegetable seller next to it. There were cows dominating the streets, which isn\u2019\
  t a rare sight in India, and a grazier nearby. I reached out and furthered my question\
  \ which made him come out of his multi-layered turban that covered almost half his\
  \ face. He pointed to a house with a small porch with a hand pump dug right next\
  \ to it. I nodded and walked past the women busy with the daily chores. \n\nThe\
  \ doors were decorated, not with ornaments or garlands, just a usual design on the\
  \ doors typical of the countryside and one which never gets outdated. The lock was\
  \ a chain, a curvy tangle of two iron bars, reaching the loop on which they hung.\
  \ Admittedly, it made me nostalgic. And it was just beginning!\n\nI was being hosted\
  \ by a family of five, two of them had left the village in search of luck in the\
  \ service sector. The owner, Mr. Badal, showed me my room or my hut that had everything\
  \ you'd need to get a perfect night\u2019s sleep - a charpai (woven bed) with bedcovers,\
  \ a small window, an even smaller bulb hanging from the thatched ceiling, and last\
  \ but definitely not the least, no cellphone reception. \n\nI set out, without a\
  \ plan, towards the sand dunes which remained largely untouched by the tourists\
  \ yet. A short walk and there it was, sparkling sand, vast expanse, thorny shrubs,\
  \ camels, and crashing waves of huge sand dunes. I frequently exchanged smiles with\
  \ the locals en route who told me about how tourism was changing in their small\
  \ village of Khuri and how they were even more excited to host the tourists as the\
  \ rush grew. A few of us gathered and saw the sun set before us into the horizon.\
  \ \n\nAt night, an eleven-year-old knocked on my door and invited me out for dinner\
  \ - the basic rice, dal, chapati, and a vegetable finely cooked- basically, everything\
  \ before the market of packaged food took over. I became unexpectedly friendly with\
  \ Ugam, Mr. Badal's wife, and saw myself helping out in the kitchen afterwards.\
  \ \n\nI sat under a clear sky adorned with millions of stars, with complete strangers,\
  \ a wonderful family, gorging on delicious food, and laughing away the troubles.\
  \ The moon shone brightly and I felt surprised realizing how I could gaze at the\
  \ sky, seemingly without getting tired ever."
