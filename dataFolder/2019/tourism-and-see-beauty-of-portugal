  By following this one week itinerary, hopefully Portugal will captivate you too!\n\
  \nDay 1: Lisbon\nAs the country\u2019s capital, Lisbon is an obvious start to any\
  \ Portugal itinerary. And its vibrancy and charm will quickly show you why its regularly\
  \ voted one of the most interesting cities in the world.\n\nSightseeing is a common\
  \ first introduction to the culture and history of Portugal \u2013 and Lisbon\u2019\
  s main sights are easy to see by foot. If you\u2019re not much of a walker, the\
  \ famous Tram 28 is an excellent way to spend an afternoon exploring Lisbon\u2019\
  s most iconic sights.\n\nThe streetcar will climb its way up the steep hills of\
  \ the city center. At some points, you have to pull your arms in because it\u2019\
  s so so close to the buildings! \nAfter you\u2019ve splurged on a few (or more!)\
  \ pasteis, head to Alfama, the oldest neighborhood in Lisbon. You can easily wander\
  \ around this area for hours without much of a real agenda. It is charming! Plan\
  \ to explore Alfama by foot in the afternoon so you can be at the top of the hill\
  \ for sunset from S\xE3o Jorge Castle. Pick up DIY picnic supplies and wine for\
  \ a romantic 360-degree panorama of Lisbon\u2019s terracotta roofs and rolling topography.Peppered\
  \ with ornate mansions and majestic woodlands, it\u2019s hard to imagine a more\
  \ fairytale-like place than Sintra. Located only an hour west of Lisbon, the resort\
  \ town is a fascinating study in creative architectural styles.Start your day with\
  \ a hike up the mountain that backdrops the city. This will lead you up a winding\
  \ path, through the woods, and to lovely views. Once at the top, walk in the 11th-century\
  \ ruins of the Castle of the Moors. This is the oldest sight in Sintra, and has\
  \ beautiful views of the valley.Just behind this castle is the endlessly \u2018\
  grammable Pena Palace. Built in the 19th century, you\u2019ll immediately notice\
  \ the colorful yellow and red exterior that has made the palace iconic. Wander around\
  \ the interior to find unique artifacts and incredible mosaic tile-work.As you get\
  \ ready to head north from Sintra, a natural next stop is Coimbra, a historic university\
  \ town built on a dramatic hilltop. The old city is filled with historical sights,\
  \ such as the Cathedral, Joanine Library, Santa Clara Monastery, and Clock Tower.\
  \ Wander through the cobblestone streets \u2013 all of which ultimately lead to\
  \ a view of the Mandego River Valley below.On your way down, be sure to visit a\
  \ Fado bar, like Hilario or A Capella, where you can listen to local tunes. Fado\
  \ is the traditional folk music of Portugal and is defined by moody melodies and\
  \ Portuguese guitar. What a unique traditional experience!"
