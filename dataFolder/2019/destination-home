Text: "I never expected to find myself in Mahtowa again.  I had spent most my life\
  \ planning my escape from the small town of 387. Mahtowa is one of those small towns\
  \ that most people just pass by heading to more exciting destinations.  I was laying\
  \ there in the warm California sun that I always dreamt of feeling homesick for\
  \ a place I never dreamt I\u2019d ever miss.  When I arrived in Minnesota the first\
  \ thing I noticed was that almost everyone who spoke had the accent that all my\
  \ California friends would relentlessly tease me about having.  We got to Mahtowa\
  \ and stopped at TJ\u2019s the little country store that is the heart of Mahtowa.\
  \  It was really TJ\u2019s that I found myself daydreaming about when I got homesick.\
  \  I remembered Christmases of the past with TJ\u2019s covered inside and out in\
  \ twinkle lights and all the town gathering to watch as Santa Clause rode in on\
  \ his sleigh then standing in line for what seemed like hours waiting to sit on\
  \ Santa\u2019s lap. I remembered Halloweens when the store was turned into a haunted\
  \ house and pretending not to be scared. There was the annual Highway 61 Folk Festival\
  \ next door to TJ\u2019s at Robs Tavern every year and I recalled the year when\
  \ my dad won and how proud I was of him.  It seemed half my childhood was spent\
  \ outside of TJ\u2019s with my friend Leah. Leah and I would sit on the bridge and\
  \ talk about boys throwing sticks and rocks into the creek. When we left TJ\u2019\
  s that day it didn\u2019t feel the same as all things change TJ\u2019s had changed\
  \ too but there was still some remnants of it\u2019s old days like the old wooden\
  \ floor and the smell of the homemade sausage and beef jerky it had become infamous\
  \ for.   Heading down highway 61 the same highway 61 Bob Dylan sang about we would\
  \ pass what most people probably miss.  A little cross with flowers on the side\
  \ of the road I am never able to pass by without thinking about how it got there.\
  \  One foggy March evening in 1990 there was a young man driving his old truck down\
  \ Highway 4 when his brakes would give out at the exact same time that Paula Brigan\
  \ was driving on highway 61 where the two roads intersect.  In the back seat of\
  \ Paula\u2019s car was her little 18 month old daughter Jessica who was sitting\
  \ on the lap of the babysitter when the crash occurred.  In that one moment many\
  \ lives were forever altered and little Jessica ultimately did not survive the crash.\
  \  I pass that cross and I remember little Jessica. When I left Mahtowa I didn\u2019\
  t know that some ghosts both figuratively and literally would follow me all my days\
  \ no matter how far I ran.  I grew up in a haunted house just a few miles from TJ\u2019\
  s.  The original house we moved into burned to the ground but my parents decided\
  \ to rebuild on the same land and we all experienced our fair share of the unexplainable\
  \ in that house I can\u2019t help but wonder if the new owners have had the same\
  \ experiences.  The next day I decided to head out to Bob Lake with my kayak.  Bob\
  \ Lake is a small lake with just a few homes on it and it is one of the most serene\
  \ places on this Earth I\u2019m quite sure. That day I was the only one out on the\
  \ entire lake. I kicked back in my kayak and watched the giant Eagles nest hoping\
  \ to catch a glimpse of the mother who could often be seen bringing food back to\
  \ her babies but this day I did not see her.  I just enjoyed the quiet and the feeling\
  \ of serenity as I had finally begun to make peace with my past. I fell in love\
  \ with my home town again on that visit and I would leave longing not to escape\
  \ but to return again.  Yes you could simply pass by Mahtowa without a second glance\
  \ but you would miss as I almost did a town worthy of a second chance."
