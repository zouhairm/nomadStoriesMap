Text: "The story starts in Sri Lanka, where a woman finds a little boy on a tea plantation\
  \ and takes him in. \n\nThe family eventually leave Sri Lanka and the young man\
  \ grows up in England. As an adult, the young man returns to Sri Lanka to manage\
  \ a tea plantation. Working on the same plantation where he was found, he begins\
  \ searching for his family and birth mother. While on his secret search for his\
  \ family, he meets and falls in love with a tea buyer, but this isn't entirely a\
  \ love story. It's a story of tea, of crime, of family and sacrifices.\n\nUnfortunately,\
  \ his search for his mother uncovers many other evils such as human trafficking.\
  \ He gets to close to truth which lands him in danger and he is kidnapped by a human\
  \ trafficking ring.\n\nThe tea buyer discovers he is  missing and must go in search\
  \ for her love. Her desperate journey to find him will take her to Hong Kong, China\
  \ and Taiwan where she will uncover more secrets and crimes with the fragrance of\
  \ tea in the background of this story. Will she make it in time? Will she find him\
  \ alive? Will her search topple the ring or land her in danger too?\n\n\nIf you\
  \ love tea and travel, take a journey with the tea buyer and uncover shocking truths."
