Text: "Sometimes all you have to do\u2026 is to listen\u2026\n\nMy plane landed in\
  \ Armenia early in the morning. I had been spending for a week in this country.\
  \ I was a witness of 3 conversations and 2 announcements which show me this country\
  \ in difficult time of revolution. I expected to hear something serious, but sometimes\
  \ simple words could explain more than millions of dramatic ones.\n* \t* \t*\n\u201C\
  It was confirmed by the opposition that the protests in the city continue. The head\
  \ of their movement, Nikol Pashinyan, is ready to fight to the last. There was information\
  \ about the blockade of streets and the international airport. All flights will\
  \ be postponed indefinitely.\u201D\n* \t* \t*\n\u201CHave you heard it? We continue\
  \ to strike! Finally, someone will restore order in this country!\u201D\n\u201C\
  You think revolution is a good idea? Do you think something will change? The PM\
  \ has already resigned. It seems everything leads to completion. But after so many\
  \ days we haven\u2019t achieve our goal.\u201D\n\u201CWe will. My husband\u2019\
  s already standing in the mid of the road with our neighbors. We\u2019ll block our\
  \ street. My brothers will block the next street, and someone \u2013 the next one.\
  \ All together, we must put the city in order. Pashinyan knows what he\u2019s doing.\
  \ Armenia is in good hands.\u201D\n* \t* \t*\n\u201CExcuse me, how can I get to\
  \ Erebuni? This is a museum, right?\u201D\n\u201CYep, darling. This is the museum.\
  \ But it\u2019s just on the outskirts of the city, and now traffic jams\u2026they\u2019\
  re everywhere. I'm a taxi driver, not a wizard. Take a look! No, you just look at\
  \ that! Guys are playing the ball on the road, these ones just pulled out the chair\
  \ and chatting with the neighbors! How am I supposed to feed my family? After so\
  \ many days we\u2019re still on strike.\u201D\n\u201CThen why go to work, if you\u2019\
  re not able to drive?\u201D\n\u201CI mean\u2026I\u2019m able to, yeah\u2026 Actually\
  \ you\u2019re able to drive after a couple of blocks, if you know where to turn.\
  \ Get in. I'll give you a little ride.\u201D\n\u201CReally? Thanks a lot! I don\u2019\
  t even know how to\u2026\u201D\n\u201CBut you\u2019ll pay as usual. Sorry, it's\
  \ not my fault. I can\u2019t help it.\u201D\n\u201COkay. I agree. Let\u2019s do\
  \ it. Just tell me later how to walk there. I'm here for the first time.\u201D\n\
  \u201CYes, I will, of course. Get in.\u201D\n* \t* \t*\n\u201CThe speaker of the\
  \ parliament, Ara Babloyan, calls to stop attacks on deputies and appoints the second\
  \ round of the elections of the Prime Minister on May 8. So far this is all from\
  \ the news of Yerevan. We will keep you informed. Now especially for you the song\
  \ \u201CLa Boheme\u201D by Charles Aznavour, a french musician and composer of Armenian\
  \ origin. Yerevan, you will never fight alone\u201D.\n* \t* \t*\n\u201CHey? What\
  \ do you want? Sorry, I\u2019m a tourist and I don\u2019t understand. I do not take\
  \ part in rallies.\u201D\n\u201COh, sweetie, she gives you this for free, don\u2019\
  t be afraid.\u201D\n\u201CFor free?\u201D\n\u201CYes, take it. Just a fresh watermelon.\
  \ I tasted it too. Some raspberries, maybe? Don\u2019t be so shy!\u201D\n\u201C\
  Thanks. You have all the rallies in a similar way? More like a holiday.\u201D\n\u201C\
  No, at first it was necessary to fight a lot. Not now. Now we have almost won, but\
  \ we will stand up to the end. There\u2019ll be order in our country. We all know\
  \ Nicol as ourselves. He will do everything right.\u201D\n\u201CYou have good people\
  \ here, friendly and open. Not in all countries so.\u201D\n\u201CSure thing! That\u2019\
  s why we\u2019re saving the way of our country. Come on! Just taste it! Really delicious!\u201D\
  \n* \t* \t*\nI came to Armenia to see the sights, but suddenly realized that their\
  \ main relic is the soul of the nation. This is their main strength.\nAll of Armenia\
  \ is a small piece of land at the foot of the huge Mount Ararat, their symbol. People\
  \ here are bona fide. People here are active and open. No wonder they think not\
  \ only about themselves, but about the whole country.\nThey respect their history.\
  \ They build their future. They are not afraid to live in the present moment."
