Text: "Deep darkness is cut as the sun crests the eastern peaks, lighting an unseen\
  \ vista in front of me and stopping my steady plod mid-stride. The wakening city\
  \ of Antigua, Guatemala, reveals itself through settling dust. Worn colonial architecture\
  \ fills the narrow valley nestled between three looming volcanoes, whose ominous\
  \ presence is never quite forgotten. Earthquakes and eruptions have shaped this\
  \ place for ages, and raw elemental forces continue to rule here.\n\nMy gaze floats\
  \ across the vista and I am able to pick out a particular rust-coloured rooftop.\
  \ It is one of many to most, but it is where my day began hours earlier with a sip\
  \ of coffee. Now, perched on the slopes of Volc\xE1n de Agua, I was tracing down\
  \ that cup's origins - literally.\n\nAn almost audible smile to my side pulls me\
  \ back to firm ground. Turning, I find Mercedes Perez Gonz\xE1lez waiting patiently,\
  \ watching me watch the distant valley. With a quiet, \"\xA1Vamos!\" we venture\
  \ upwards to his roots above, leaving behind these roots below.\n\nMercedes is a\
  \ coffee farmer and today I am his apprentice. With the unhurried and steady cadence\
  \ of a man who will unapologetically arrive where they are going whenever they happen\
  \ to get there, he leads the way up the meandering path. \n\nWe spend the day together\
  \ in his world - picking coffee high on the volcanic slopes and carrying it on our\
  \ backs down to the tiny yard adjacent his home. From here, the operation expands\
  \ and becomes a family effort. Mercedes introduces his daughter Lydia, who spares\
  \ only a quick smile before getting to work. Swiftly depulping the coffee, we spread\
  \ it to dry on the sun scorched roof.\n\nThe process of coffee is long and involved,\
  \ and we waste no time. Lydia reaches for a basket of already dried beans, turns\
  \ its contents over on a worn wooden table, and we all sit down to sort them like\
  \ a family coming together to tackle a puzzle of a million pieces.\n\nShoulder to\
  \ shoulder, Mercedes' easy smile and eagerness to chat welcomes me into his life.\
  \ We get to know each other as the heat of the midday sun warms our backs. Body\
  \ language filling in gaps of communication due to my broken Spanish, we build up\
  \ a rapport that goes beyond language. From beneath his wide brimmed hat, he tells\
  \ of the origins of his farming life.\n\nSeven years ago, with the help of a low-interest\
  \ small loan program, he began coffee farming here. \"It takes about four years\
  \ for a new coffee plant to yield sellable beans,\" he explains. \"That's a long\
  \ time without making money. Without the loan, I could not have afforded to start.\"\
  \ Originally this allowed him to begin farming on a small piece of land, just under\
  \ one acre in size. Today, he has paid back that loan and successfully expanded\
  \ his land holdings to almost six acres.\n\nAt the back of the house, sorted beans\
  \ are finally funnelled into burlap sacks and ready to be passed along to eager\
  \ buyers.\n\nThe day's work now behind us, we all sit down on Mercedes' shaded veranda.\
  \ A colourful tablecloth is thrown over the rough wood we were working on just moments\
  \ earlier, and bright blue cups are filled with steaming, dark coffee - its beans\
  \ freshly roasted over the fire. Mercedes lifts the drink to his lips and takes\
  \ a long, appreciative slurp. Cup in hand, Mercedes smiles up at me from under that\
  \ wide-brimmed hat of his and says he is happier than he has ever been. \"This life\
  \ is good, and now my daughters can get an education and find whatever life is good\
  \ for them.\"\n\nThe next day, I am back on the rooftop terrace watching the city\
  \ wake, Volc\xE1n de Agua drawing my gaze. I close my eyes and take a long sip of\
  \ coffee. Memories return: I can almost feel the warmth of the volcano's pulsing\
  \ heart, smell the earthiness of its nutrient rich soil, and appreciate the tireless\
  \ effort put into carefully cultivating this cup. A cup of coffee is so much more\
  \ than it first seems. Opening my eyes, I am grateful."
