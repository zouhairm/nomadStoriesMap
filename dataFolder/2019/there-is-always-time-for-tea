Text: "As we rounded one, then two small mountains, I felt a tug in my heart for the\
  \ city of Tienshui. Not because it\u2019s a nice city. Long and narrow by the demand\
  \ of the mountains on either side, the city is an urban jungle of development. The\
  \ river is dammed and host to weeds and grasses, rather than water, in many places.\
  \ And then of course there is the lung-smothering smog that most Chinese cities\
  \ are notorious for. \n\nI arrived in Tienshui, one of the larger cities in the\
  \ Gansu province of China, with my friends and travel companions: Timb, Paul, and\
  \ Patrick. My friends were 19 days into what still is a two-year journey along the\
  \ (symbolic) Silk Road; from Xi\u2019an, China, though Central Asia, to either Istanbul\
  \ or Rome as a final destination. They are walking the entirety of their route,\
  \ and I decided to join them for a few sore and blister filled weeks. \n\nWalking\
  \ with these three, we left a thread of intrigue and fascination everywhere we went.\
  \ The sound of our voices, or trailer tires, or laughter would cause people to look\
  \ up and slowly pause the work they were doing. Perhaps letting the broom fall idle\
  \ in hand, or standing slowly from where they were crouching to pull weeds. I felt\
  \ guilty leaving all these people with not even a grain of understanding as to why\
  \ we were weaving so quickly in and out of their life. But then there were the places\
  \ we decided to stop. Perhaps to shop for food or water, perhaps to see a temple,\
  \ or perhaps just because we needed to sit. And that\u2019s when people would come\
  \ out of the woodwork. \n\nTienshui was one such place. We met \u201CTea Lady\u201D\
  \ when she and her husband stopped us to offer warm water, fresh bread, and invited\
  \ us to visit a cultural site the following morning. The next day, we spent far\
  \ longer than we had planned wandering the grounds of a peaceful temple that Fuxi\
  \ is said to have built. Tea Lady knew so much history of the place, and Patrick\
  \ translated what he could. I wandered in and out of the adult conversation, while\
  \ examining flowers with her children. They would talk to me in Chinese and I to\
  \ them in English, yet somehow we held conversations all day. \n\nAfter noon, Tea\
  \ Lady insisted we head back to the city to have lunch in her home. On the way she\
  \ stopped the car and pulled us all onto a street crowded with people and covered\
  \ in Ginkgo leaves. We four Americans were immediately surrounded by smiles, laughter,\
  \ music, and selfie sticks. The young son of Tea Lady held my hand \u2013 seemingly\
  \ both pleased and nervous to be in the center of attention \u2013 and led me where\
  \ he deemed necessary. It was stimulation overload, and yet we couldn\u2019t stop\
  \ smiling. As swiftly as we arrived, Tea Lady swept us back into the car, and we\
  \ were off again. \n\nSoon we pulled up to their home, and found grandma already\
  \ preparing lunch. The kids pulled us into the kitchen and giggled as they watched\
  \ us try to cut noodles. Once grandma took back over we were all slurping noodles\
  \ together in no time. \n\nNot long after eating, Tea Lady asked if we wanted to\
  \ stay for tea. At this point we had no intention of making any miles, so we sank\
  \ into her large sofa and watched her deliberately set out a beautiful ceramic tea\
  \ set. She sat on one side of the table while her children flitted in and out. We\
  \ sat for hours, drinking tea and watching her pour, steep, stir, and sip. When\
  \ it was time to move on, this home felt familiar. Even though the apartment was\
  \ overflowing with a culture not of my own, we were comfortable there. We parted\
  \ ways having exchanged nothing but food, fragmented thoughts in two languages,\
  \ time together, and most importantly: a story. I realized that even if we couldn\u2019\
  t connect with every person we walked past, the thread we were stringing along behind\
  \ us was weaving together cultures regardless."
