Text: "When in Rome , In my case it is called the rome of India , Goa . All those\
  \ memories flash in front on my eyes even to this day as a pleasant , sweet smelling\
  \ vacation . When I was a tiny tot with my parents and sister , had gone on a road\
  \ trip to several places but goa was special . The feeling of being in Goa is different\
  \ , that serene and distinct smell in the air . When we reached panaji I could see\
  \ the horizon where the sea meets the sky and sun from the window of my car and\
  \ the road running parallel to the sea, a view that I will never forget . Soon we\
  \ reached the large fields of sunflowers where my sister and I posed with sunflowers\
  \ , so beautiful were we and our lunch was a deliciously plated plain rice along\
  \ side goan prawns were the essence of the trip for our taste buds were going madly\
  \ insane which was yet so simplistic . We ended up going to the beach writing our\
  \ names as if we owned them but alas the water washed them plain blank . In the\
  \ evening the night sky lit up so bright with all those stars as we lay on the beach\
  \ which were covered by sea shells . Meeting of people of different kinds and origins\
  \ some were french , russian , iranian , uzbekistanian and definitely how can we\
  \ miss the goan locals those romans .The mix of people who fill the place were immense.\
  \ All immensely happy and immensely fun. Hospitality was their forte . They really\
  \ took care of us . From those beach facing room services to the best local places\
  \ to visit . They showed as all .Beautiful architecture filled churches , museums\
  \ and alleys . Light hearted and fun clothed people with those fancy head capes\
  \ and hats would let the hippie in you breathe in the uptight you.Live a little\
  \ and let your soul have a fun dance . For those souk can get you all dressed up\
  \ in a trinklet , earrings and necklaces and those fancy shoes .That sun shining\
  \ bright down on me while I flap my legs in the beautiful beach may it be candolim\
  \ , calanguate or baga . That immense view of the sea from Aguda and the stories\
  \ of a boat rider of how he has viewed and seen a mermaid and how she has saved\
  \ a lives of several in a ship wreck which was magical indeed. The much more amusing\
  \ stories of the drug dealer Jimmy by the locals which keeps you entangled in the\
  \ mystic goa where his house placed right in the middle of an AG church and a jail.\
  \ The very loud noisy educative boat ride of goa with people on it going all awe\
  \ towards the sun setting land of wine and dine. You can't fathom to know all this\
  \ and be just wise.You cannot whish and wash these memories.These are the beautiful\
  \ ones . \nThe small and quaint toddy shops to those loud drink till you drop beach\
  \ facing shacks for people to forget what they have to .\nThose well lit casinos\
  \ sailing in the mid sea where you can gamble all your pockets have to those old\
  \ coin and stamp shops.\nThose large bridges leading to parts of goa. The silent\
  \ walks on the bricks laden roads and the old age lamp post .\nTo more of such escapades\
  \ and those fun on the roof kinda ones.\nI have never hoped to have enjoyed myself\
  \ so much but at the end I did with all my heart.\nI would like to relive the whole\
  \ experience just for the time and again for Goa to come back into my life .  \n\
  For goa is a feeling , an experience and is meant to be cherished and not lived\
  \ . It is plain and simple good for the soul. Enriching and cherishing ! \nTowards\
  \ the end I didn't feel like leaving but just by the thought of a promising sunrise\
  \ to a better tomorrow star lit sky we moved on to the rest of the road trip . What\
  \ was in the goan air ? Was it love and care with a huge long welcome stare . Being\
  \ dreamy-eyed yet again ! Why so immensely, hard hittingly beautiful?"
