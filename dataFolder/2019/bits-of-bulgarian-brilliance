Text: "It all started with an unplanned bus trip from Athens to Sofia with a final\
  \ destination of Istanbul.\nUnsure about my means of transport to Turkey and hearing\
  \ about Varna a few days prior, I was curious enough to discover it.\nI happened\
  \ to sit near someone on the bus who intended to drive to Varna from Sofia, riding\
  \ with a complete stranger isn`t something I recommend but it does add truth to\
  \ this tale.\nThe forty-something Slavic man who owned an apartment in Varna, drove\
  \ me through the peasantry yet quaint countryside stopping for lunch at a vintage\
  \ service station.\nWe were greeted by a friendly local woman wearing a headscarf,\
  \ offering us traditional Bulgarian chorba (soup) with all kinds of unknown assortments\
  \ as ingredients.\nContinuing on our journey, I witnessed the sad reality of young\
  \ teenage girls selling themselves at the side of the road in broad daylight that\
  \ was a culture shock to me but common in rural areas.\nUpon arrival at the Varna\
  \ apartment, I departed the man\u2019s company as his advances were becoming a concern\
  \ and made way to the YoHo hostel in downtown Varna.\nWhat I find intriguing about\
  \ Eastern Europe is the difference between the ordinary apartments in suburban areas\
  \ and the beautiful city centres with their stunning old towns and rich historic\
  \ architecture.\nTreated to a free walking tour of the city, I explored the traditional\
  \ Russian style temple, Varna Cathedral, considered one of the most beautiful in\
  \ the Balkans, people marvel at when it lights up of an evening.\nWalking along\
  \ the ancient ruins of Roman Thermal Baths, the largest on the Balkan Peninsula,\
  \ it occurred to me, Bulgaria is much more than a former Soviet country but with\
  \ deep historical presence of the Greek, Roman as well as the Ottoman occupation.\n\
  In this far easterly corner of the former Soviet state by the Black Sea, I couldn\u2019\
  t believe there was an unexpected paradise of pleasant climate, mixed cultures and\
  \ clear blue seas.\nHolidaymakers flock from all regions of Europe, particularly\
  \ because its cosmopolitan nightlife, ideal for party makers but still relatively\
  \ unknown as a destination making it a hidden gem.\nAlong the seafront, not to be\
  \ missed, is the Varna Hot Springs, a spot the locals enjoy with water between 38-40\
  \ degrees over-looking the ocean.\nI befriended a 28-year-old Ukrainian woman living\
  \ in Berlin but on a teaching contract in Shumen, an hour\u2019s train ride away.\n\
  I was asked to stay at her house for the following few nights and arrived at the\
  \ train station late at night with no lights on, although creepy, the eeriness added\
  \ to the experience.\nAs a city built within a cluster of hills, there are certainly\
  \ some great walks and site seeing to do, none of which I had researched previously\
  \ but Hanna knew some American Historians who were teaching at the same high school\
  \ as her, who voluntarily took us on a tour of the surrounding areas.\nLeaving the\
  \ centre of the pretty nineteenth-century town with its quaint cafes and shops,\
  \ is a grand stone stairway leading to the Monument to 1300 years of Bulgaria which\
  \ is a very impressive stone construction towering over the valley of Shumen.\n\
  The monument is supposed to tell the history of Bulgaria from the Roman and Ottoman\
  \ occupancy to the communist political era with impressive yet intimidating giant\
  \ sculptures baring a menacing stare down upon you.\nBehind the forest is a beautiful\
  \ forest walk to the lime caves.\nThe cave monasteries functioned during the second\
  \ Bulgarian Empire of the Byzantines, difficult to access but we were able to navigate\
  \ a hollow cave for us to fit underneath having a clear view of potential invaders\
  \ below us.\nUpon returning through the national park, we got a glimpse of the Shumen\
  \ Fortress in the distance described as an ancient archaeological site owned by\
  \ the Thracians in the 5th century B.C. later controlled by the Romans who built\
  \ towers and walls and restored by the Byzantines before Shumen thrived throughout\
  \ the Middle Ages.\nA 10-hour hike was the perfect thing to do before an overnight\
  \ bus trip to Istanbul that evening plus discovering secrets of multifaceted Bulgaria."
