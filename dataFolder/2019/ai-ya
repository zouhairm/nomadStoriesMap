Text: "Gelatinous, and still warm, the milky blob of spit that bubbled and wobbled\
  \ on my foot stopped me mid-step. It\u2019s important I tell you up front that it\
  \ was not my spit. That it was preceded by a deep, guttural hacking from a nearby\
  \ stranger. And that, well, I barely flinched.\nMy stop was more of an abrupt beat\
  \ as the crowd jostled me along the packed street. \nThick with city breath. Oppressively\
  \ hot. Walking felt more like swimming up-tide in custard.\nIt was a muggy Hong\
  \ Kong day, and even though a man had just - albeit it accidentally - spat on my\
  \ foot, I simply uttered a disgruntled: \u201Cai ya\u201D (how local I felt!), and\
  \ continued, undeterred. \n\nOn a quiet(er) corner \u2013 a relative term on an\
  \ island with over 7 million people - I wiped my foot, relieved that I was wearing\
  \ what I had dubbed my \u2018street\u2019 flip-flops, a cheap and functional pair\
  \ I\u2019d bought because my daily commute meant walking through a traditional wet\
  \ market and I couldn\u2019t subject another pair of leather sandals to this particularly\
  \ soggy street. \n\nThe wet market was my favourite place in Hong Kong. It made\
  \ me dry wretch. \nIt reminded me, in a very visceral way, how extremely different\
  \ my world had become, and how I loved that. I\u2019ll set the scene for many a\
  \ Hong Kong wet market: you\u2019ll see shirtless, pot-bellied butchers hacking\
  \ and chopping various cuts of meat and fish, hanging them up, then throwing buckets\
  \ of water over their counters, leaving the street a cesspool of blood and scales.\
  \ The smell of unrefrigerated meat in 30-degree heat with 90% humidity at 7:00 in\
  \ the morning is enough to turn just about anyone (realistically, only really me\
  \ and roughly 2% of the population) vegetarian. \n\nI\u2019d made the temporary\
  \ moved to Hong Kong a light-year (which in travel terms, is relative to one regular\
  \ year) earlier, to pursue that time-old, traditional voyage of self-discovery for\
  \ so many na\xEFve and hapless middle-class and utterly clueless white kids: teaching\
  \ English in Asia.  \nExcept, I wasn\u2019t a kid. \nAnd I wasn\u2019t quite teaching\
  \ English. \nAnd I wasn\u2019t in what I\u2019d expected to find as \u201CAsia\u201D\
  . \n\nI was in a place where markets down side streets intersected with sky scrapers.\
  \ \nWhere \u2018card-board\u2019 grannies pushed carts piled high with boxes, bent-backed,\
  \ but moving faster than sports-cars stuck in stand still traffic. \nI was in the\
  \ fragrant harbour. Filled with every kind of unsettling and sour smell so completely\
  \ contrary to anything one might dub fragrant. \nI didn\u2019t expect to find Asia.\
  \ So beautifully contradictory. Alive with the throb of millions of morning commuters\
  \ who filled a space in my mind that hadn\u2019t stretched enough to even include\
  \ the daily drudgery of morning commutes, let alone the smells, and the spit, that\
  \ make a place: real."
