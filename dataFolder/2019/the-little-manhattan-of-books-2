Text: "If you are not from Turin, the Mole and the two rivers will help you. Chivalrous\
  \ and flirty the Po, coming from the mountains and wild the Dora: the two rivers\
  \ will always know how to show you the way. If it\u2019s foggy and you feel melancholic,\
  \ though, you just need to look up at the sky: the 167 meters tall Madamin* wanted\
  \ by Mr Antonelli works as a giant, masonry, GPS.\n\nSince I\u2019ve been living\
  \ here \u2013 roughly 2 years \u2013 I tried to write down every corner, every point\
  \ of the city in which she was showing herself to help me. There were so many, that\
  \ I started to think that the monument was alive and able to constantly move around.\
  \ And that\u2019s how \u2013 in this nimble yet reassuring way \u2013 that the Mole\
  \ gained my sympathy, but this is another story.\nThe one I am telling today it\u2019\
  s about a housekeeper that used to dust off books. About a part of the city that\
  \ \u2013 seen by the sky \u2013 resembles a triangle. Just like Manhattan \u2013\
  \ but way smaller \u2013 it\u2019s a magic place where tram cables interlock buildings\
  \ and novels, where people come in and out just like ships in an harbor: in a slow\
  \ and adventurous way, bringing some stories\u2026 and taking others with them.\n\
  \nHugged by two rivers,\n\nClose to the Mole,\n\nYou are welcome to\u2026\n\nThe\
  \ small Libreria Therese.\n\nMrs Therese is the main character of an old novel by\
  \ Elias Canetti. The owner of the bookshop, Davide, found this sly and moany lady\
  \ really amusing. That\u2019s why \u2013 12 years ago \u2013 he decided to name\
  \ its bookshop after her, right in a Vanchiglietta corner. Considered as a loud\
  \ and congested neighborhood by the Turin inhabitants \u2013 Vanchiglietta is pretty\
  \ peaceful to me, since I am coming from Rome.\n\nThis labyrinth made of pages and\
  \ shelves called Therese, is an amazing corner to get lost or to find yourself\u2026\
  \ what\u2019s the difference, after all?\n\nThe local residents know this well:\
  \ wheter they are coming from the hill or whizzing on the bike from Lungodora, living\
  \ right upstairs or stopping by before watching a movie in the Fratelli Marx Cinema:\
  \ the Therese, affectionately Theresina, it\u2019s always worth a tour.\n\nYou will\
  \ always find someone wandering around the shelves or lined up in front of the counter\
  \ (a hidden, secret and almost cloaked place).\n\nFrom the corner behind the counter,\
  \ you can find alternately Sara, Davide and their bound stories. Stories about the\
  \ most beautiful book written about Torino, about the last Foster Wallace collection\
  \ or about the time that a friend, in order to get Sara to read a very big book,\
  \ brought it to her divided in three parts (or pieces).\n\nCause books are symbols\
  \ but they are things too, they are pages but they are lives too, and everyone takes\
  \ them and brings them the way they feel and can.\n\nThere\u2019s another thing\
  \ that who is familiar with Therese knows well \u2013 and who is not quickly learns:\
  \ the serious yet easygoing passion that the blonde girl and the wise guy put into\
  \ this bookshop.\n\nExperienced, fun, passionate, joyful, they constantly create\
  \ must-attend events, they chat with the other bookshop owners and treat the store\
  \ as a home. Or as a store where you sweat moving around the tools. Or like a living\
  \ room where you meet your friends, the kind of living room where you can put your\
  \ feet on the table. A place where there is always someone saying the right joke,\
  \ someone who brings wine and bread, someone else in a corner, thinking.\n\nAnd\
  \ then there is you, wandering around and opening a book or two, or three, at peace\
  \ with yourself.\n\nFeeling safe, adventurous, within the strong and flexible walls\
  \ of the little Libreria Therese."
