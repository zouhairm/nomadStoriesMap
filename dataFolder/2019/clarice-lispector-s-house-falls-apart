Text: "In Maciel Pinheiro, a small square located in Downtown Recife, there are two\
  \ women who live surrounded by pigeons. One of them is a lady in her fifties who\
  \ lives in the fountain. There she takes a daily bath, feeds the pigeons and keeps\
  \ some cardboards that uses as a bed. Sometimes she speaks alone or with the lions\
  \ of the fountain. Sometimes she talks to Clarice, who never replies.  \n \nThe\
  \ other woman is Clarice Lispector, one of the main writers of Brazilian modernism\
  \ who died forty years ago in Rio de Janeiro. Right now she is just a statue smeared\
  \ with bird droppings in the middle of the square, and from her stone pedestal is\
  \ doomed to see how the house where she grew up falls apart day after day.\n   \
  \ \nThat was the scene I came across following the steps of the novelist through\
  \ the streets of Recife. Instead of finding a museum or at least a nice plate honoring\
  \ Lispector, I saw that the 387th house in which she had lived was completely abandoned.\
  \ The yellow paint of the walls was cracked and blackened by moisture, replaced\
  \ by vibrant graffitis in which could be read the phrase \"maximum respect for the\
  \ women of Pernambuco\". What a paradox. \n\nI could only imagine that from this\
  \ house, Clarice used to listen closely to the heartbeat of Recife and the sellers\
  \ of the central commerce of Boa Vista Avenue during the thirties. She received\
  \ in the mornings the salty wind of the beaches to which nobody dares to enter,\
  \ even today, fearing the sharks. \n\nI see those walls as a clear reflection of\
  \ Recife\u2019s dualities. It is a city of artists and feminists, but also of absolute\
  \ poverty and neglect. During the daylight it is the \"Brazilian Venice\" but at\
  \ night gets drunk with \"Ax\xE9\". It is the same city that Lispector describes\
  \ in her Memories of Carnival, but the vibes are different.\n\nI approach the statue\
  \ of the writer, who rests her hands on a stone typewriter. She has a lot to say\
  \ but not a single paper. I want to tell her that her house is rotting and that\
  \ her beloved city that received her from Ukraine seems to turn its back on her\
  \ and on many other women. But then the night approaches. The sounds of Boa Vista\
  \ become increasingly strong as it fills with young people. Through the funk songs\
  \ and samba beats that come from a bar nearby I hear voices of women. \n\nI see\
  \ them coming back from school and from the university. Leading small marches in\
  \ the streets and demanding improvements in the health system. Asking for the reopening\
  \ of a nearby theater. Going out to dance and sing without fearing the darkness\
  \ of the city. They converge in the center of Recife, in Maciel Pinheiro square.\
  \ I turn to see the woman at the fountain who feeds her pigeons in complete calmness\
  \ and I think to myself, \"Indeed. Maximum respect for the women of Pernambuco\"\
