Text: "On March 15, 2018, it was my first journey to China, no one accompanied me\
  \ even from my institution or my friends, me alone. Oh my God, I had never been\
  \ to China before and a lonely traveler. I couldn't speak Chinese or Cantonese,\
  \ even before I went there, I asked few of my friends who had ever been there, but\
  \ still in my mind was worry and nervous. On the D day, I travelled with Cathay\
  \ Pacific and I felt like went into the big plane with luxurious cabin. When I sat\
  \ on my bench, thanks God, the man next to me was Indonesian also, he wanted to\
  \ go to Japan, Osaka exactly. He asked me if was this your some travels to China?\
  \ No, it was my first time. When the plane landed in Hong Kong, I was helped by\
  \ the man who sat next to me. He wanted to helped me because his plane was at 11\
  \ to go to Japan. Thanks God he helped me, so I could learn about how the transit\
  \ plane was. I shared to him my cup noodle to waiting my next plane to Guangzhou,\
  \ China. And finally I should say Goodbye to him, and I continued my flight to Guangzhou.\
  \ It was about 2 hours from Hong Kong. When I arrived in Guangzhou, to attend the\
  \ conference about education internationally, I was picked up by the committee,\
  \ her name is Joyce, I never expected that she spoke English, she was friendly and\
  \ a bit of my worry was gone at least. I was dropped at the 4 stars hotel, and no\
  \ one could speak English fluent but Joyce. When I went into the room, wow a luxurious\
  \ hotel that I had ever stayed, but the problem was that I was hungry, I tried to\
  \ phone the hotel to ordered the food that I preferred, but they didn't understand\
  \ me because they couldn't speak English. so, I tried to go downstairs to find some\
  \ food. Thanks God I found the hotel restaurant but still they didn't understand\
  \ what I ordered. I explained again and again and at least I was given the food\
  \ that I wanted and the waiter gave me also the beverage free, which when I looked\
  \ at the menu, the price for the beverage was quite expensive, lucky me. Even they\
  \ didn't understand English but they tried to be friendly and kind.\n I had my roommate\
  \ from Malaysia, his name is Simon, he also helped me to know more about this city,\
  \ Guangzhou, because his grandpa was from this city, thanks God I didn't expect\
  \ to had a helpful roommate like Simon. He bought me a Halal noodle, which he knew\
  \ me from Indonesia that majority people is Muslim. The next day at the conference\
  \ I also didn't expect that I had another friends from Malaysia and Batam, Indonesia,\
  \ oh thanks to you God, they helped me much to communicate with the committee to\
  \ get Halal food and the place to pray. Then, I could go with them and I enjoyed\
  \ travelling China until I went back to Indonesia with the longing to go back to\
  \ China."
