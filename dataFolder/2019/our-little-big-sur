Text: "Sun spilled out. Car journeys. Close Friends. Scene and sky, golden, lifting.\
  \ The South-West Coast of Ireland, on the most far outer reaches. Countryside of\
  \ glory, awaiting to be explored. Myself and two great friends, an old car full\
  \ of tents, pillows and supplies. Prepared for good times ahead.\n\nThe cassette\
  \ player crackled and whistled, sounds and soothing tunes. Hours of driving, stories\
  \ and laughs drizzled along the way.\n\nUpon reaching the tip, the edge of the known,\
  \ the great vast peninsula opened up to our eyes. Roads cut through jutted cliff\
  \ sides, glistening blue water below. Like Big Sur, California, but on our little\
  \ Island. The first time in all my years visiting this spectacle, and an already\
  \ beautiful time at that. Instilling, thrilling moments of intricate beauty. From\
  \ my heart to the islands core.\n\nWe made the most of our short time, straight\
  \ from our first steps. Taking off running. A quaint campsite in Caherdaniel. Sleeping\
  \ on the peninsula. Tents pitched, evening drawing in. A rice dish, cooked on the\
  \ stove. Walking it off on the shoreline, sun setting on the water, silhouetted\
  \ hills in the near distance. Skipping rocks off the still stream. Both young and\
  \ old, in bliss, at this. Moments of rejoice with fellow travellers. Beer flowing,\
  \ music playing. Sounds of sweet serendipity. The sunset spilled into the night,\
  \ which followed, full of fun and folklore. The beat of the Bodhr\xE1n drum mimicking\
  \ the quickening pulse of the heart.\n\nAn early morning awakening the following\
  \ day. Recharge, refuel. Pop down the tents, and short farewells, before traversing\
  \ into the distance. More beauty to ponder, to wonder, to experience. Our next campsite,\
  \ tucked away in Derrynane. Hilly, tumbling, picturesque camp spots. Pitched upon\
  \ a viewpoint, seeing ocean and sea line, miles along, basking in the sun.\n\nOff\
  \ to Derrynane beach, the sun and time of year transforming Ireland into the tropics.\
  \ Crystal white sand, and cyan water, so clear it can be seen from your soul. Oh\
  \ so still and clear in this inlet, the warmest water I ever swam on Irelands shore.\
  \ Kayaking around the bay. Laughing and racing, examining the cliff faces. Boats\
  \ floating blissfully, their occupants out back, eating lunch in the peace and serenity\
  \ of that gleaming scene.\n\nReturning to the campsite for sunset and sounds. Climbing\
  \ along the jagged and low coastline. Chasing the incoming tide. Feeling as if we\
  \ were ten years old. Feeling free. Feeling wild. Reflecting, discussing, engaging.\
  \ A nourishing time,  full of curiosity, with memories from the heart.  Dusk to\
  \ night spent in a cove, feet in the sand. Beers from the adjacent bar. Witnessing\
  \ colours I\u2019ve never seen before. Onwards, to time spent laughing in the tent.\
  \ Absorbing these cherishing memories first hand. Indescribable. Incredible. \n\n\
  The next morning upon the opening of the tent, low and behold, sunset flourished\
  \ over the peninsula and bay. Staring in amazement. In complete wonder, but for\
  \ this landscape, and its residents, just the start of another day. After a golden\
  \ morning of breakfast, cups of tea and chats, the tents were hauled and finally\
  \ packed. A scenic detour through the gap of Dunloe. Scenes of another world. Roads\
  \ so narrow, the little car found it hard to manoeuvre. And I more so, distracted\
  \ by the beauty. But we soldiered on, past horse and cart, little side paths. A\
  \ pod of discovery. Through Killarney national park. A sleepy, silent, but lovely\
  \ journey home. Fuel stops, snack breaks. Remembering and once again rejoicing.\n\
  \nThat trip to Kerry was beautiful, something that could never have been predetermined.\
  \ It\u2019s randomness, and pure free flowing nature, gave it a unique charm. Forever\
  \ locked in my heart and mind, a true adventure, and heres to many more."
