Text: "\u201CIf you think adventure is dangerous, try routine; it is lethal.\u201D\
  \ Paolo Coehlo\nUnknown can be scary and it\u2019s never easy to approach it. It\
  \ can be confusing, it can hit you hard, but it also writes some magnificent stories\
  \ that forever change our life path. It takes you on an amazing journey with most\
  \ unexpected turn of events. It brings joy into your lungs, it frees your soul and\
  \ forever changes your mindset.\n\tSummer of 2018 decided to send me to one of the\
  \ world\u2019s most elegant and powerful cities \u2013 Moscow. Since I\u2019m studying\
  \ Russian language, I gladly took the opportunity to spend a month in a city of\
  \ literature, history and architecture. I never waited for someone to join me, I\
  \ never waited for people to make decisions for me, so I applied, not knowing a\
  \ single person that was participating. Frankly, I didn\u2019t care! That is the\
  \ beauty of travelling \u2013 getting to know so many people, finding the ones that\
  \ fit you right and letting them stay in your life. But it never occured me that\
  \ Russia\u2019s capital will also bring me closer to the love of my life. The one\
  \ that\u2019s also been living in Vienna for so long, but never crossed paths with\
  \ me. The one that\u2019s also from Serbia. The one who\u2019s goals, dreams and\
  \ fears dance so good with mine. I had to go to Moscow in order to find him.\n\t\
  So I arrived at Vienna International Airport on a chill, summer morning, waiting\
  \ for some unknown guy to join me on my way to Russia. My feelings were all mixed\
  \ up \u2013 I woke up at 3 am, so I wasn\u2019t really in a mood to talk with anyone,\
  \ especially with some random guy that just happens to participate in the same programme\
  \ as I am. On the other hand, I was excited to enjoy Russian language, walk the\
  \ streets of Bulgakov\u2019s \u2019\u2019Master and Margarita\u2019\u2019 and make\
  \ new memories. As I patiently waited for this person to join me, I spotted someone\
  \ approching me and speaking in Serbian. That was him! Finally! But there were two\
  \ other people with him, whom I didn\u2019t expect \u2013 loud redhead and a funny\
  \ friend of hers. They all somehow knew each other, so I was the outcast in that\
  \ group. So I headed to Moscow with these three stranges, not knowing that from\
  \ then on, things will never be the same.\n\tMoscow\u2019s huge! was my first impression.\
  \ All those tall buildings, hundreds of metro stations intertwined in a way I couldn\u2019\
  t understand, wide boulevards and smell of new, unknown, unexplored filled my heart\
  \ with joy. I clearly remember the first time I found myself on the Red Square.\
  \ It felt like all those magic moments that people describe in books, fairytales\
  \ and poems, like the whole universe moved into my head, like nothing ever could\
  \ top the feeling of standing in a crowd, surrounded by so many people, but being\
  \ completely alone with this amazing sound of life passing by in the most beutiful\
  \ way I can imagine, staring at the St. Basil\u2019s Cathedral standing proudly,\
  \ showing off, glowing under the warm, summer sky. Moscow was really a dream coming\
  \ true.\n\tOur days passed by really quickly. We were constantly in a hurry, trying\
  \ to make the most out of our month in Russia. I always felt like I\u2019m missing\
  \ out on something, like there are so many things that I haven\u2019t seen yet,\
  \ that Moscow will remain undiscovered, unknown and that my time there is limited.\
  \ But that all changed on a hot summer night, when I was embraced in a strong, warm\
  \ hug that still to this day didn\u2019t end. It made time stop, it made all my\
  \ worries seem so unimportant, so small, so stupid. It made Bolshoi theatre our\
  \ first date spot. It made Red Square a place we would late at night, when no one\
  \ was around. It made Moscow become a city I\u2019ll always remember differently.\
  \ It filled me with love. The unknown suddenly became the most beautiful journey\
  \ life has ever taken me to. And I owe it all to Moscow!"
