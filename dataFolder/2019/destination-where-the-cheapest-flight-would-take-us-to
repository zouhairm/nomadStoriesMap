Text: "Last summer my two best friends and me finished highschool and wanted to fix\
  \ a good memory of it. So we thought about a trip of a couple of days but we couldn't\
  \ decide the destination because there are so many places we wanted to check out\
  \ that we didn't know where to start from. Therefore we made a deal: we would have\
  \ booked the cheapest flight from our nearby airport, whatever the destination would\
  \ be. As fate would have it, we landed in Lille, a charming Flemish town located\
  \ on the border between France and Belgium, a place far away from the tourist routes,\
  \ where we didn't see a single souvenir shop. And I'm so happy about it, because\
  \ I discovered a town very few people know and I didn't know much about myself before\
  \ stepping there. As soon as we arrived there we immediately understood we were\
  \ about to live an authentic travelling experience into the unknown. The airport\
  \ of Lille was really small, surrounded by golden cultivated fields, that we kept\
  \ contemplating for an indefinite period of time (which resembled an hour) waiting\
  \ for the airport shuttle. When it finally came, we hopped on it and asked in english\
  \ for a \"return ticket\" (that was more convenient than a single ticket) and the\
  \ driver looked at us confused. He spoke French only, even if he was driving an\
  \ airport shuttle that probably many foreigners would take. A guy sitting in the\
  \ first row helped us and we bought our tickets. The landscape around Lille gave\
  \ off a peaceful vibe, there were lots of golden fields that I wondered if I was\
  \ in the south of France instead, like in a Van Gogh painting depicting the landscape\
  \ of Provence. Maybe it was because of the summer light that made everything more\
  \ shiny. Entering the suburb of Lille we saw some lush parks, the town has many\
  \ of them, as for example Jardin des Geants, Jardin Vauban, Jardin des Plants, Parc\
  \ de la Citadelle, and there is even a nature reserve of 13 hectares in the town\
  \ area. When we had checked in at the hostel, we went out to explore a bit, walking\
  \ through the park surrounding the fort that is a military base. We saw families\
  \ with children playing, fit people doing jogging, someone walking the dog, it wasn't\
  \ anything special but in some way it was nice how Lille welcomed us with scenes\
  \ of everyday life, of people that were probably thinking about what to do the following\
  \ day, since it was going to be mid August. In the evening, we moved towards the\
  \ centre and got lost in the streets of the Vieux Lille, characterized by typical\
  \ Flemish architecture, with tall and narrow buildings made of red bricks. Two types\
  \ of beer (Trolls and Tongerlo) in a bar where locals hung out completed our first\
  \ day in Lille. The next day, after a full breakfast in the hostel with croissant\
  \ and pan au chocolat, off we went to see the town from above the Beffroi, a tower\
  \ in Art d\xE9co style. When we arrived at the base of the huge 103-meters-high\
  \ tower we expected to find some tourists, maybe a small queue, as the place is\
  \ advertised as one of the main attractions of Lille, but there was absolutely nobody\
  \ and the place seemed closed. We waited a bit, walked around the tower, took some\
  \ photos at the arc the thriompe nearby and we were almost heading back when a family\
  \ came asking if the tower was open. We rang the bell at the tower and after a minute\
  \ a woman opened. We didn't understand clearly if the place was open or she just\
  \ let us in out of kindness but at least we got to see Lille from a different perspective.\
  \ The weather wasn't very nice and there was a cloak of fog at the horizon creating\
  \ a sinister atmosphere. We then visited the museum of art which had some paintings\
  \ of Monet and Van Gogh. We also visited the Vieille Bourse where there was a market\
  \ of old books and postcards and people played chess in the middle of the patio."
