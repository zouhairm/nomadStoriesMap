Text: "In the summer of 2016, I undertook a trip to southern Mexico that made me fall\
  \ in love even more with my country and really appreciate the culture that this\
  \ land comprises.\nI went mainly to support indigenous communities in Chiapas and\
  \ artisans in the area as part of a social service program at my university. I think\
  \ I learned more from the locals than they did from me. \nThe work of the artisans\
  \ of the Maya area is one of the most beautiful and dedicated jobs I have seen in\
  \ my life. They dedicate days, months and even years in the elaboration of their\
  \ textiles, which are also loaded with history and symbols that are inherited from\
  \ generation to generation, there lies all the beauty and wealth of their work.\
  \ Unfortunately, in Mexico, the work of indigenous artisans is usually less valued\
  \ and cheapened by people just because they are indigenous, but I am proud to know\
  \ that at design festivals in other countries they appreciate their work a lot because\
  \ they really value handmade work.\nAmong the cities and communities of artisans\
  \ I visited, I went to San Juan Cancuc, the poorest municipality in Chiapas. One\
  \ of my most precious memories, when I reach the community, was to see a girl without\
  \ shoes and only underwear and a torn blouse, very happy playing with a leaf of\
  \ a plant in a puddle formed by the rain simulating that she was sailing with a\
  \ boat, I loved to witness so much happiness in the simplicity of life. The population\
  \ was really small, and they lived practically in the jungle, the landscapes between\
  \ the mountains were spectacular, and I visited a healer, the only one in that region.\
  \ He had kilometers of crops of different plants, and he knew specifically the benefits\
  \ of each and how to mix them to heal various discomforts and diseases. Being a\
  \ healer is a profession of honor and a sacred legacy, in order for being taught\
  \ all the knowledge about the properties of plants, their father must speak with\
  \ Mother Earth through dreams to grant them the gift of healing. In Chiapas, there\
  \ is great respect for shamans and healers and an amazing syncretism between Catholic\
  \ beliefs and mysticism, perhaps like nowhere else. In San Juan Chamula is where\
  \ you can appreciate even more remarkably this syncretism that they practice with\
  \ fervor. The church of the town, dedicated to San Juan Bautista, apparently on\
  \ the outside is like any Catholic temple, but there are not benches inside because\
  \ they pray on their knees and there are only herbs all over the place and even\
  \ chickens for the rituals with animals they practice like the ancient Mayans.\n\
  In addition to customs, beliefs, knowledge about the Mayans and astrology, I learned\
  \ some interesting facts about the Popol Vuh, the sacred book of the Mayas, the\
  \ most important text that is preserved of them that narrates the creation of the\
  \ world. I was also amazed and proud of the diversity that exists and that so many\
  \ dialects and cultures are preserved.\nAnd definitely what will continue to surprise\
  \ me the most about Mexico, is how different it can be between one State and another,\
  \ in a very contrasted way, both socially and in its ecosystems. The weather is\
  \ very different from the north to the south of the country, there are 12 types\
  \ of ecosystems and seven of them in Chiapas. In some places, it seemed that I was\
  \ in the Amazon, in others in some forest in Germany, in others in a lake in Canada\
  \ or New Zealand, in others in some cloud forest in Colombia, in others in some\
  \ waterfall in Vietnam and all these ecosystems are located in Chiapas, a state\
  \ that wherever you look, you can see landscapes worthy of a postcard.\nHonestly,\
  \ at the beginning of the trip, I didn't think it would change me and expand my\
  \ awareness of myself, other people and the value of hard work, culture, traditions,\
  \ and diversity of Mexico."
