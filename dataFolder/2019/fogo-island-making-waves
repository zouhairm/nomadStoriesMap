Text: "Fogo Island Making Waves\n\n\t We arrived at the Fogo Island Inn to hot tea\
  \ and biscuits, raspberry jam, and a armful of Newfoundland tinder for the wood\
  \ stove that warms each guest\u2019s quarters. Floor to ceiling windows suspended\
  \ us directly above the wild waves of Canadian Spring, and the colourful quilt on\
  \ the bed reminded me of Gram\u2019s house. Something about the place felt like\
  \ home.  \n\tFogo Island is on the northeast tip of Newfoundland, about 25 km across\
  \ and with a population of twenty-five hundred. Being from Prince Edward Island,\
  \ I was used to small harbours, boat sheds, and a cultural life built around tourism\
  \ and the fisheries. My husband and I made passage to Fogo via an old grey Sedan,\
  \ two ferries, a boatload of late May ocean churn, and the wind whistling from the\
  \ north. \n\tThe Fogo Island Inn is a social enterprise, owned and run by the Shorefast\
  \ Foundation, a Canadian charity dedicated to sustaining local industry. Founded\
  \ by social entrepreneur Zita Cobb, the Fogo Island Inn brings jobs to the people\
  \ of Fogo and has largely been credited to have completely revitalized the island\u2019\
  s economy. The inn itself looks like an ancestral dwelling in that it sits atop\
  \ stilt wood legs, called shores. The effect is a sweeping traditional out building\
  \ which meets contemporary design.\n\tAfter an orientation, we are ready for out\
  \ trips. The price of lodging includes food and any and all excursions by community\
  \ hosts, who are vested storytellers at the ready to take you out and show you every\
  \ pond, brook and inlet of Fogo. \u201CAfter the moratorium on the northern cod\
  \ industry, Fogo\u2019s economy was crushed,\u201D our guide explains as we tour\
  \ a large ship yard. I gaze at crab traps piled high in the boats. \u201CThe government\
  \ offered incentives for people to leave and travel inland,\u201D he continues,\
  \ \u201Cbut Fogo Islanders \u2014 they wouldn\u2019t go.\u201D \n\tHaving worked\
  \ in my twenties in the Canadian Rockies, I\u2019ve often thought of the cost of\
  \ tourism disrupting not only the local landscape, but the architecture of small\
  \ communities. Shorefast focuses on the opposite by presenting an authentic Newfoundland,\
  \ down to each doorknob, tea cozy and rocking chair. Everything is made by artisans\
  \ on Fogo, each bedpost and chair handcrafted and designed in a large workshop with\
  \ all-Newfoundland textiles. Furthermore, everything from the wood shop is for sale.\
  \  \n\tWe hiked up to the top of Brimstone Head, a craggy terrain of rock, and looked\
  \ out to the icebergs that float down from the north, and their playful seal counterparts.\
  \ Up winding paths and down the pebbles that border its shores, we visited the unique\
  \ and vibrant arts spaces that welcome artists and writers from around the world,\
  \ implemented through the Fogo Island Arts program, a branch of the Inn. Each of\
  \ the small arts venues (located all throughout the island) brings contemporary\
  \ inspiration to the ancient shorelines of Fogo, and the waves that have crashed\
  \ there for four hundred million years. \n\tRegional tourism is born from a love\
  \ of supporting local, and while we didn\u2019t stay long on Fogo, we certainly\
  \ felt embraced there. Zita Cobb reimagined a future for Fogo, one where the Inn\
  \ could sit in an innovative partnership between land and sea, but also benefit\
  \ the Island in zealous pursuit of modern ecotourism, and the results have been\
  \ astounding. \n\tReturning back to PEI with a pickle sandwich from the Inn, I felt\
  \ an even greater commitment to my island. It has never been more the time to tell\
  \ the the stories of Atlantic Canadians \u2014 of lovers, of dreamers, and of drifters.\
  \ But with the tools of social enterprise, we can all bring the lessons of Fogo\
  \ home. Overcoming adversity in Atlantic Canada and abroad in all small communities\
  \ takes resilience of spirit, commitment to local tradition, and the perseverance\
  \ of creative minds."
