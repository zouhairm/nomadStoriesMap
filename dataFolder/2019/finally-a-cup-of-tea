Text: "Finally I found out the reason behind the Second World War. Wasn\u2019t it\
  \ tea that brought allies together or parted away the nations? Having a cup of tea\
  \ in Turkey was not lesser that a mini-World War for me. \nI never knew how important\
  \ is a cup of tea in the Turkish culture. What more could tell about the value of\
  \ tea, when even a critical decision of getting married is based on the serving\
  \ of a cup of tea by the prospective bride-to-be?\nThanks to Couchsurfing community,\
  \ that made me spend few nights with a Turkish host in Istanbul. On my first-ever\
  \ night in that country, I learned that my kardes (brother) can not speak even a\
  \ single word of English, just like I was not partial to learning Turkish my whole\
  \ life. The first challenge we both faced, on entering his home, was about the decision\
  \ on having tea. Being a considerate host, he desired to offer me arrival tea but\
  \ I was unable to comprehend about this profound offer. Why making me sit in the\
  \ TV lounge, he ran to the kitchen, was dawned on me when he came back with an empty\
  \ tea-pot, asking me if I drink tea. I heartily took the offer and that\u2019s when\
  \ the fun began. He had to ask me how much sugar would I take? At first I didn\u2019\
  t even know it was sugar he was holding out to me, as it was big cubes instead of\
  \ crystals or powder. I thought it\u2019s some kind of dessert. So, I just took\
  \ the sweetest offer ever by the sweetest host ever. It was only hours later when\
  \ he put the cubes in his cup, I came to know this is no dessert but plain sugar.\
  \ Anyhow, better late than never.\nThe next step was quiet easy. He just opened\
  \ the fridge and let me know that I can have any fruit from there. But then, again,\
  \ he had to serve the tea with some cookies or pastries. He had not the slightest\
  \ idea what would I have with my tea, nor could he inquire. In a blissful moment\
  \ of divine inspiration, some heavenly thought came to his Turkish mind and he picked\
  \ up his phone, opened google and showed me the picture of what he was talking about.\
  \ It was in that moment when suddenly could feel a chord being formed. We could\
  \ see The Grand Design. If we can show each other pictures of eatables from google\
  \ images, why don\u2019t we use google translator to convey full sentences!\nThen\
  \ he said in his phone\u2019s microphone, in Turkish of course, if I would like\
  \ to have this pastry or those cookies? Google translated the Turkish to English,\
  \ I heard it and knew what he was asking. With the language barrier cut, we two\
  \ could do a lot of things now. So he took me out to the market, showed me different\
  \ places. And all that night we were communicating through our Google Translators.\
  \ \nBut as me and my host were home again, we finally had that cup of tea with the\
  \ accessories. And let me assure you, that one cup of tea was worth every single\
  \ effort that was put in it. In fact it was more. Every sip I took of that cup was\
  \ rich with my host\u2019s culture, my own language and the fresh air of the food\
  \ streets we walked in together."
