Text: "A year ago, I travelled to one of the most beautiful country in Asia. Japan.\
  \ Japan has their rich and very outstanding culture. Eversince when I was a kid,\
  \ I\u2019ve been dreaming to go and see that magical place. Until I turned that\
  \ dream into reality. I truly enjoyed my time roaming around and seeing the views\
  \ and the most historical places of Japan. Enjoying their food and trying all the\
  \ ritualts that they do. But the best thing that I experienced in Japan is when\
  \ I witnessed how Kind, how patient and how passionate the Locals are. People in\
  \ Japan are the best. They are very welcoming. They are very kind and always willing\
  \ to help. I remember going to a Ramen Museum, as I travelled alone, I have to know\
  \ everything about my itinerary. But there was a time that I got confused with the\
  \ google maps because it was not accurate. As I exited the train station, I didn\u2019\
  t know how to follow the maps. I tried to navigate it but it didnt work. Until I\
  \ decided to ask a lady, she was walking fast like she\u2019s in a hurry but I tried\
  \ to approaced her \u201CHey!\u201D and asked her about the directions. She was\
  \ so nice and she talked to me. I know she\u2019s in a hurry so I asked her to just\
  \ show me in the maps about the direction. But she told me that she wants to go\
  \ with me and she will bring me in that place, and I refused. I told her that I\
  \ don\u2019t want to be the cause of delay since she\u2019s in a hurry. But she\
  \ said, \u201CNo. I want you to arrive safe there. We value our visitors and we\
  \ want them to feel welcome and safe\u201D. At that moment, I didnt know what to\
  \ react but just say thank you very much. That was the first that I hear words like\
  \ that when travelling. Truly the people in Japan are all very welcominga and I\
  \ believe that they still bring their beautiful culture and values in themselves\
  \ wherever they go, whoever they meet and whatever circumstances they face. It was\
  \ such a nice feeling relief when we got to the museum and so, I treat her a bowl\
  \ of ramen, and then after that we became friends and until now we are still having\
  \ a connection that I believe will last a lifetime."
