Text: "As usual, the lady who lived opposite to the night school brought me chai after\
  \ I finished teaching. Her kindness is emblematic of the Lepchas, the mountain people\
  \ indigenous to the misty Himalayas.\n\nI sat at the concrete doorway of the school\
  \ and looked out at the view that rural India offered to me, taking in the bamboo\
  \ forests and the pale green terraces that dotted the hillside. They would soon\
  \ disappear as the wispy clouds roll in and drench the mountains. Many of its inhabitants\
  \ were Lepchas, a welcoming, hardworking tribe who fought and rallied the government\
  \ to have their language and culture recognised.\n\nThe line between being a teacher\
  \ and a friend at night school became blurry as it was a place where I tutored English\
  \ and played games with the children after classes. Of course, I had my favourites.\
  \ Jiwan, the fourteen year old who lived with the lady, had surpassed even that;\
  \ he had become a genuine friend. He had small, paper-thin body of a boy much younger\
  \ than him and yet, was the loudest of all the children, with an obnoxious cackle\
  \ for a laugh and was a shocking cheat at games.\n\nI was wary of him at first because\
  \ he was temperamental and was always getting into fights, but I found myself staying\
  \ back at school every day to chat with him. We would tell stories of when anger\
  \ got the better of us, or exchanged gossip about the villagers.\n\nI didn\u2019\
  t have time for another chat after my drink, but my chai was accompanied with an\
  \ invitation to dinner in the lady\u2019s broken English. I looked at her round,\
  \ kind face with eyes that had disappeared into a toothy smile, the tanned hands\
  \ holding out the mug were rough from farm work in the steep foothills, and accepted.\n\
  \nThe lady lived in a few shacks made of mud walls and tinned roofs. They were nestled\
  \ on the hillside with rows of tea bushes, overlooking the rolling valleys. She\
  \ sent Jiwan to look after me whilst she prepared dinner. I sat on the narrow wooden\
  \ bed in the children\u2019s room and watched Jiwan as he walked around in the dim\
  \ light, talking excitedly and showing me his collection of panda figurines. He\
  \ was wearing the same ratty red fleece that he always wore and faded grey sweats\
  \ that were much too short on him.\n\nJiwan was the only person at night school\
  \ who did not belong in the village, and I did not understand why this boy lives\
  \ in a small village hidden by the clouds when his mother and siblings were in Nepal.\
  \ When I finally asked, he simply told me how lucky he was to be happy even though\
  \ he should not be. I didn\u2019t know how to respond. He grinned.\n\n\u201CMiss,\
  \ I cannot think I\u2019m allowed to be this happy, with so many friends and doing\
  \ good at school, when my life is a mistake.\u201D\n\nJiwan picked up a terrible\
  \ drawing and proudly showed it to me. He rambled about how his family live across\
  \ the border in a dark house, because his father broke the ceiling light in drunken\
  \ anger and they do not have money for reparations. He could never sleep at night\
  \ because his mother\u2019s quiet crying was too loud for the thin walls.\n\nIt\
  \ was soon time for dinner. I trusted the lady to be an amazing cook because the\
  \ food in the Himalayan foothills had not failed me yet, and I was correct. In front\
  \ of me was a spread of Nepalese food, with plates of momos, daal, and fried rice.\
  \ Halfway through dinner I excused myself and cried in the toilet, thinking about\
  \ how his father had shown up to divorce negotiations drunk and demanded that Jiwan\
  \ was to live with him in India. Had he not offloaded Jiwan to a distant relative\
  \ soon after, I would never have met him.\n\nI picture him sometimes, walking behind\
  \ the lady in the hills. They have a mountain of gathered tea leaves strapped to\
  \ their foreheads, and Jiwan has big grin on his face, the perseverance of the mountain\
  \ people shining through the clouds."
