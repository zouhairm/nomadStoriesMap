Text: "The road leading from San Jos\xE9, Costa Rica's capital, to the Caribbean is\
  \ winding and dangerous. Mack Trucks pass our little van way too close for my comfort.\
  \ Reggaeton - a Latin American music somewhat similar to hip-hop blasts through\
  \ the stereo. I'm heading to Puerto Viejo de Talamanca, home one of the fiercest\
  \ and most powerful waves in Costa Rica.\n\nThe town feels sleepy in the morning,\
  \ but it surely comes alive at night. Expats, ticos and Rastafaris mix in the warmth\
  \ of the Caribbean. \"Cerveza fria\" in hand, I stroll through the tiny roads -\
  \ some made of pavement, some made of the dirt. The loud music and the sweet smell\
  \ of marijuana seem to follow me at each step. I've got to go to bed.\n\nEarly in\
  \ the morning I'm awaken by the fear-striking sound of the howling monkeys that\
  \ live around my hotel. It's about five in the morning and the sun has already risen.\n\
  \nThe same streets that were buzzing at night are now empty. I slowly make my way\
  \ to the shore only to find a capsized vessel resting on its side. A victim of Salsa,\
  \ I suppose. The waves here break over shallow reef that covers the seabed. It's\
  \ powerful and scary, but there are already people making their way to the outside.\n\
  \nWith my surfboard under my arm, it's time to surf. There's a deep-water channel\
  \ that goes all the way to the wave, that breaks about 400 feet from the shore.\
  \ I quickly get ready, as another surfer is ready to make his entrance. I follow\
  \ his lead and make my way out unscathed.\n\nI had never seen a wave suck up so\
  \ much water. Sure, I've gone out on bigger days and have surfed bigger waves, but\
  \ Salsa Brava is something special. As soon as I get to the line-up, a young-looking\
  \ man with big dreadlocks makes a late drop in a steep wave. My stomach dropped\
  \ for a moment, as I was sure he was going to wipe out and probably hit the reef\
  \ underneath. In the very last second, he gets up on his feet as a curtain of white\
  \ water engulfs him. For a moment I get a glimpse of his expression. He\u2019s smiling,\
  \ as comfortable as one can be.\n\nPeople are sitting close to each other, but only\
  \ few words are exchanged. Shouts, in the other hand, are heard every time someone\
  \ gets barreled, which happens often. I overheard some locals talking. \"Salsa is\
  \ a criminal wave\". \"Quando Salsa no te quieres, ella no te quieres\u201D. Notes\
  \ taken.\n\nI paddle hard for my first wave. It feels like my board is lifting under\
  \ my chest as I get momentum, and the water level seems to be pushed in the other\
  \ direction as I pop up on my feet. The wall of water gets steeper, and for a moment\
  \ my board seems to be losing traction. My fins finally engage in the water as I\
  \ slide down the face of the wave. I can feel the exact moment when the adrenaline\
  \ kicks in. I'm in ecstasy.\n\nI want more of this hot sauce. I paddle even harder\
  \ for my second wave, a large barreling right-hander. Feeling confident, I misjudge\
  \ my timing. Instead of sliding gracefully on the face of the wave, I'm helplessly\
  \ thrown over the falls like a little rag. Bracing for impact, I cover my head with\
  \ my arms. I know what is going to happen next: I'll hit the reef. Miraculously\
  \ I don't. But when I emerge, the sour smell of the corals floods my nostrils. I'm\
  \ definitely in shallow waters, and that's not a good thing. There's a strange shadow\
  \ casting upon me. I look to my left, and there's a big ship hull just a few feet\
  \ aways. I knew right away I was in danger and that I had to think quick.\n\nI start\
  \ paddling as fast as I can toward the deep-water channel. I'm shaken, but unhurt.\
  \ Back at \"tierra firme\", I'm still trembling. I could have died that day, but\
  \ I'd never felt so alive. I knew right then that I had fallen in love with that\
  \ wave."
