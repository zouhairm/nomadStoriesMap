Text: "On my list of things that I should have been doing that year, upping my life\
  \ and moving to Sydney was not one of them. \n\nHowever, when late January rolled\
  \ around and the Christmas blues had failed to shake themselves from my bones, I\
  \ found I had no choice. Accept defeat and return to my home university, or battle\
  \ through my mental illness and embark on the second leg of my year abroad? I chose\
  \ the latter. \n\nPeople told me that I would love Sydney. A glistening metropolitan\
  \ city, famed for its beaches, bars and sunshine days. A didn't vitamin D help alleviate\
  \ depression? \n\nI stepped off the plane terrified yet hopeful. The sky was a bright\
  \ blue and my accommodation was perfect; central, with a view of the iconic skyline\
  \ from the rooftop terrace, made complete with multiple 'barbies', of course.\n\n\
  *\n\nOur first few weeks there, before term started and we'd be confined to the\
  \ restraints of a classroom yet again, we explored. We cleared our minds in the\
  \ hills of the Blue Mountains. We walked for hours without meeting anyone - mainly\
  \ because we were poor students and couldn't afford the overpriced 'Scenic World',\
  \ an easier way for tourists to experience the area. On our solitary hike, we met\
  \ a lonesome, angry turkey. I questioned my new (kind of) friends when I returned:\
  \ Is it usual for turkeys to be so aggressive here? \"OMG yes!\" screamed one of\
  \ the girls. \"Bush turkeys,\" she continued. A genuine thing, apparently. \n\n\
  A few hours north, still enjoying our extended holiday, we lazed on the beach and\
  \ my partner ate kangaroo, albeit in a pie. I struggled to understand the peculiar\
  \ remote accent of a server in a fish and chip shop. We laughed as we ate our food\
  \ by the docks. \n\nBut with the pressure of school, and with my support system\
  \ now placed down in the sticks of Wollongong, my fleeting moment of bliss was just\
  \ that. \n\nI sought solace roaming the nearby shopping centre, alone.  The air\
  \ conditioning was a welcome relief from the sticky Sydney summer, for which I was\
  \ grossly unprepared; I had even packed my winter coat. Nearby, I discovered where\
  \ all the hipsters hung out, but the artsy shops and welcoming graffiti of Newtown\
  \ did little to lift my mood. \n\nI was furious with myself. Even after finding\
  \ the quieter sands of Bronte Beach, I was still incredibly unhappy. The sun shone,\
  \ but I was still sad. I had sincere female Australian friends who were inviting\
  \ me to parties and for chats on that idyllic roof terrace, yet I preferred to stay\
  \ in bed, curtains drawn, watching old YouTube videos of Antiques Roadshow. \n\n\
  *\n\n\"I'm glad you're feeling better,\" said my therapist one day. \"I was going\
  \ to suggest that you go back to the UK, you seemed very unwell.\" I had just lied\
  \ to her about my feelings towards her and her city. I told her that I was eating\
  \ again, informed her that I'd discovered the nearby supermarket she had directed\
  \ me to - a shop which I had frequented many times before our first meeting. \n\n\
  I took a breath. I recollected my thoughts. I thought \"I am on my own, I need to\
  \ find a way to cope.\" I walked around the campus, around those Hogwarts-style\
  \ buildings and dainty cafes filled with smiling, sociable students. I walked past\
  \ them and continued to the neighbouring park. I sat in the shadow of the trees,\
  \ far enough that the Wi-Fi dropped, but close enough that I could walk a few metres\
  \ and be reconnected again. \n\nI read. I placed my body on the dry, patchy grass\
  \ and I consumed every book that I had ever thought of reading, every fantastical\
  \ story that would help me understand yet forget my own feelings. I missed class\
  \ to read. I skipped lunch, to read. I unplugged from the rest from the rest of\
  \ the world and dragged my limbs to that patch of ground that was mine, it was mine.\
  \ I got angry when someone else sat there. I still remember how the blades felt\
  \ against my shins."
