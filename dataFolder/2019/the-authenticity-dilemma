Text: "It\u2019s my first night in Cambodia and I find myself on the rooftop patio\
  \ at a hostel in Battambang eating dinner with a few other travelers. We are sharing\
  \ stories about our latest adventures, describing our favorite meals, and talking\
  \ about our future destinations -- the typical backpacker stuff. One guy says that\
  \ he went in search of an ancient form of Cambodian kickboxing, which led him to\
  \ spend the afternoon with a group of men practicing in the middle of a field somewhere\
  \ outside of town. The girls mention that they ended up in someone\u2019s home singing\
  \ karaoke the previous night after the bar closed. Throughout the conversation,\
  \ there is a clear demand for exchanging stories about these unique, not-in-the-guide-book,\
  \ \u201Cauthentic\u201D experiences. We wonder aloud about what is written in the\
  \ guide book, how it got there, and how it has changed since its exposure to the\
  \ backpacker community.\n\nAnd then Prak, a local tuk tuk driver, sits down, and\
  \ I ask him where he has traveled in Cambodia. He says he has never left Battambang.\
  \ \n\nAt this point I turn to face him, offering him my full attention while the\
  \ others continue talking amongst themselves. Cambodians don\u2019t travel much,\
  \ he tells me, only the rich ones do, and they are only rich because they take advantage\
  \ of the poor. A decade ago there was no work. People would work all day in the\
  \ fields for $1, or go to Thailand illegally and work all day in the fields for\
  \ $3. Passports cost well over a hundred dollars, enough to prevent a majority of\
  \ the population from affording one. So thousands of people would sneak into Thailand\
  \ through the jungle, far from any legitimate border-crossing, just to find some\
  \ work. All this for only $2 a day more than they were earning back home. \n\nThe\
  \ situation has improved in the last ten years, Prak tells me, so there is some\
  \ work in Cambodia today, but it\u2019s not much better. Now, more hotels and restaurants\
  \ in Battambang are hiring, and it\u2019s easier to borrow money to buy a tuk tuk\
  \ or start a business. But even so, the only steady work is during the high season\
  \ of tourism, from December through April. The rest of the year it rains, and most\
  \ people need to work odd construction jobs here and there just to get by. Many\
  \ young people still go to Thailand during this time to find work, spending half\
  \ the year away from their families.\n\nPrak told me all of this when I asked him\
  \ where else he had been in Cambodia. After listening to his story, the idea that\
  \ we were traveling around his country in search of authenticity did not sit well\
  \ with me. We all had our own idea about what authentic Cambodia looked like, while\
  \ the experience that Prak shared involved working twelve-hour days driving a tuk\
  \ tuk and never once leaving Battambang.\n\nPrak has never studied socio-political\
  \ systems, but he understands that there is an economic imbalance in the world.\
  \ He is constantly interacting with a rotating cast of westerners who are spending\
  \ months on end traveling from country to country for their own pleasure, and he\
  \ will likely go through life without a passport. This imbalance is the context\
  \ that we encounter when we choose to travel in the Global South, and we cannot\
  \ ignore it. Rather, we should collectively shift our mentality away from this far-fetched\
  \ desire for authenticity, and instead start seeking initiatives that support local\
  \ economies. \n\nMuch of the draw for western travelers visiting the majority world\
  \ involves experiencing a new way of life, but a key piece of cultural understanding\
  \ can get lost in translation when searching for authenticity. Because sometimes\
  \ authenticity abroad means after-hours karaoke, but sometimes it means driving\
  \ a tuk tuk for twelve hours a day and earning just enough to cover your basic needs.\
  \ I trust this is not the authentic experience you had in mind when you set out\
  \ on your journey."
