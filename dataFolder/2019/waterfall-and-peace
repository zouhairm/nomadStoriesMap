Text: "The cascading roar of ice-cold water over rocks, the sweet music of running\
  \ water in my ears and the smell of freshwater mixed with nature and rocks in the\
  \ air. Nothing, absolutely nothing could have compared with the majestic view and\
  \ experience I had at the moment.\n\nThe overwhelming peace I felt at the moment\
  \ paid no tribute to the inner turmoil I had experienced in the past few weeks.\
  \ A huge smile on my face, a bouncing spring in my step and peace in my heart, who\
  \ could have thought a simple waterfall could make such a huge difference?\n\n\u201C\
  I would like to go to somewhere new.\u201D I had whispered to my husband at first.\n\
  \n\u201CWhat did you say?\u201D My husband asked.\n\n\u201CI would like to travel\
  \ or at least visit somewhere new\u201D. I said, a little louder this time.\n\n\u201C\
  What do you mean somewhere new?\u201D he inquired. \n\nThat response frustrated\
  \ me. I was being pretty specific already, wasn\u2019t I? How was I to tell the\
  \ amazing man I married that few months after our wedding, I was already feeling\
  \ stifled and needed to go on an adventure? As weird as it sounded, exploring had\
  \ always been my means of getting fresh air and getting away from it all.  Even\
  \ though I don\u2019t get to do it often, it has always been my thing.\n\nSo, I\
  \ went online and started searching for spectacular places that were really close\
  \ to us. After what seemed like hours, I found what promised to be a great trip.\
  \ The pictures I found of Owu waterfall held promise of a great scenery and refreshing\
  \ experience. There wasn\u2019t much information about the waterfall except that\
  \ it was a beauty tucked away in the wilderness. Voila! Wilderness sounded like\
  \ where I wanted to be. It was just the perfect place for me. \n\nThe next day,\
  \ there we were, five of us (myself, my husband, his best friend and wife and a\
  \ friend) on our way to the waterfall. About 30 minutes into the journey, we knew\
  \ we were lost, no thanks to google map. Six stops to ask for directions and four\
  \ hours later, we were coasting down a steep slope into Owu town and it seems the\
  \ journey just began as we still had about fifteen kilometers journey to the waterfall\
  \ on an unpaved road.\n\nAlong dusty narrow roads on a rocky terrain crisscrossed\
  \ with small streams we went.  Our bikes would occasionally stumble and tilt to\
  \ the side as we rode. Soon, the forests on either side of the roads thickened,\
  \ birds chirped along the path and there was the distinct smell of nature in the\
  \ air. I could almost feel myself literally unwinding already. \n\nWe got down from\
  \ our bikes and walked the last kilometer on foot. As I walked up a very narrow\
  \ walkway, I caught my first glimpse of the waterfall briefly through the glade\
  \ of leaves in front of me. Breathtaking and almost bottomless, I felt myself pulled\
  \ towards the water.  I finally stood in full sight of the waterfall and the roaring\
  \ sounds of the cascading water filled my ears.\n\n \u201CThis was definitely worth\
  \ travelling for\u201D was the first thought that ran through my head. The sight\
  \ in front of me, the earthly smell of water, little insects chirping away in the\
  \ background, I immersed my feet into the ice-cold water in front of me and felt\
  \ the peace that had evaded me for too long. \n\nI knew at that moment that I was\
  \ right where I needed to be. I wanted to scream and shout for the joy I felt but\
  \ I settled for only a smile and the peace I could feel. \n\nI sat on top of the\
  \ rocks by the water, braving the occasional spray of ice cold water and speechless\
  \ for the tranquility within my soul. At that moment, I felt divested of the burden\
  \ I had carried for so long. I felt my sadness mix with the flowing water and get\
  \ washed away.  I could almost reach out and touch the growing peace within me.\
  \ I sat there feet in the water, happy and in peace at last!"
