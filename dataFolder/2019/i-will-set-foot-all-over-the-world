Text: 'Travelling isn''t about happy and happiness, travelling can teach all of you
  about life, the real life. Everything you can find, you can be YOU sometimes. I
  like travelling so much, because I can see every culture in this world, I can eat
  whatever I want, I can see this beautiful world with my experience and my eyes for
  real, I can have so much friends in another country especially. I already go to
  some country, Middle East (Turkey), Singapore, Malaysia, Thailand and I love them.
  They teach me and give me unexpected friends, besides that I always buy something
  there, because over than travelling I like shopping more than anything. Every month
  I must go to shopping center, hunting make up, skincare, fashion, shoes, sneakers
  and many more. And with travelling I can find all of them that I want so much because
  sometimes my country rarely to import some stuff to be here. Now I prefer travelling
  in city, it''s like "city tour", hunting food, capture photo, go to shopping center,
  go to museum, walk and cycling around city, ouuhhh its like throw away all resentment
  and learn about culture, it''s nice, very fun and more than just see the sunset
  in beach. So I hope with my hobby and passion to travelling I can be a person that
  always better, enough soul, mature, appreciate differences, and happy always!!

  Thanks'
