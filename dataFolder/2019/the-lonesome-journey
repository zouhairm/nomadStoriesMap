Text: "I have traveled throughout my life with friends and family, however, never\
  \ alone. On impulse, I booked a trip two days before and got on the flight to explore\
  \ this journey alone. \nI have been to Thailand, Bangkok countless of times, but\
  \ I've never been there alone.  This trip I decided to explore Krabi, a sunny beach\
  \ paradise of Thailand. I've never done anything alone, eating alone, traveling\
  \ around alone, or explore alone. This trip, I was determined to find out what it\
  \ would be like to do all that alone, in a country that I'm not familiar with and\
  \ with a language barrier. \nWhile on the flight there, I started to wonder if I've\
  \ made a crazy mistake. I've always been a careful planner but this time round,\
  \ I had no plans made. And I started to wonder if my trip would end up with me locking\
  \ myself in my room and ordering room service. As I arrived, I felt lost in this\
  \ unfamiliar situation. But I braced myself up and started to find a cab to the\
  \ hotel. Communication was a problem as the driver wasn't sure where the hotel is\
  \ located but thankfully it was solved after a few phone calls to the hotel. \n\
  After arriving and settling down into the hotel, I decided to get the hotel's tips\
  \ on what I should be doing for my next few days. And they suggested the island\
  \ boat tours which seemed pretty interesting and I would get to take a swim in the\
  \ ocean. Once I got the days itinerary settled, it was time to have my first ever\
  \ dinner alone. Walking on the roads, choosing a restaurant, I settled down with\
  \ a quiet one. It felt lonely to have such a tasty meal alone, that's when I missed\
  \ eating with my family. While I found boring in the past, but eating alone made\
  \ me realize how I wish I was eating with my family. \nI settled into the quiet\
  \ night and prepare for my lonesome journey the next day. Getting on the boat, seeing\
  \ that everyone was with someone they knew,  felt so uncomfortable and out of place.\
  \ So I kept to myself as how I usually would when I'm alone. Before I would brace\
  \ up my courage, a sweet couple decided to befriend me and we exchanged conversation.\
  \ I finally made some new friends! Maybe this trip wasn't going to be so bad at\
  \ all. \nThe next few days were all so new to me. Making more new friends, trying\
  \ new adventures and making lasting memories. I came to realize that even though\
  \ there was a part of the journey that I was alone,  I got that chance to reflect\
  \ on the moments and learn to cherish the people around me. \nI was happy that I\
  \ had made this choice to travel alone for the first trip in my life. And I believe\
  \ there would be more of my alone trip stories to be told in the future."
