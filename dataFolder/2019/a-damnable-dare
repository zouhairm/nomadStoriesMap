Text: "I was about clicking the shutter of my phone camera with my steadier finger\
  \ having failed to get a sharp image at the first attempt to capture my target.\
  \ However, what I saw through the lense was different from what I initially viewed!\
  \ A huge figure in army camouflage appear from nowhere adjusting his what I think\
  \ was an AK 47 riffle, and about to pull the trigger. All I could hear was the sound\
  \ of my phone dropping on the dusty ground as I raised my hands rubbing my palms\
  \ vigorously as if saying my last prayers. The armed-to-teeth soldier dashed forward\
  \ in seconds and started shouting orders and questions in a language I did not understand.\
  \ He did not speak English but the voice was scary enough to tell me I had little\
  \ time left to still be alive. In my confused state, I was begging and thinking\
  \ at the same time. Will he shoot? And if I die here, who will know? What a dangerous\
  \ adventure despite the warning!\n\nI was actually part of a group of 22 on Peace\
  \ Fellowship at the Rotary Peace Centre at Chulalongkorn University, Thailand. The\
  \ programme was aimed at training Peace Fellows all over the world. The selection\
  \ process was as tough and tedious as identifying a hungry ant as the contest to\
  \ partake was open to whoever wasinterested globally. As a journalist who had covered\
  \ violent conflicts between the Ile-Ife and Modakeke communities in Osun State Nigeria,\
  \ what I saw during the period will ever live with me and continue to make me promote\
  \ peace. consequently, as a security operative, I have had cause to deal with violent\
  \ situations on several occasions, and also realised that many of the issues that\
  \ led to violence are resolvable if there are platforms to do such. So, applying\
  \ for Peace Fellowship in far away Thailand was not a difficult decision to make.\n\
  \nAfter the third week of intensive classwork and simulations in Bangkok, we were\
  \ told that we would go to Chiang Mai, a northern town close to Myanmar border to\
  \ see those displaced by the war in Burma. We were all looking forward to see the\
  \ Thailand-Myanmar border, the refugees, the environment and if possibly some armed\
  \ groups. Our focus was to meet the displaced Shans at the border and we did. Our\
  \ guide took us to a mountain top where the Shans had built a museum in memory of\
  \ their hero, nterestingly, Myanmar can be seen clearly from from there. It appeared\
  \ so close that one could be tempted to just have a dive and get to the other side\
  \ without passport, visa or transport cost. \n\nThen came the warning! \u201CBefore\
  \ the clashes, people can cross freely. They traded and did things together without\
  \ borders. But now that has stopped. On those mountains you are seeing, there are\
  \ different armed groups. If you want to cross, you will have to go down there (the\
  \ guide pointed to a direction). That flag you are seen is Burmese flag This seemingly\
  \ short distance are filled with mines in the bush. Going there is extremely dangerous!\u201D\
  \ Burmese flag! The urge to touch the other side pushed me. When nobody was paying\
  \ attention, I decided to see the flag, take the picture of the border post and\
  \ sneak back to join the group. \n\nI dashed down the hilly cement-paved road. Within\
  \ minutes, I was there. Excited! I looked round but no sign of any life. I reached\
  \ for my phone, activated the \u201CCamera\u201D mode, raised the phone and clicked\
  \ the shutter. Ops! No enough space! I quickly browsed for video application and\
  \ without thinking, deleted two videos. By now I was sweating profusely, thinking\
  \ about my team and what could happen to me. So, with unsteady hands holding the\
  \ phone, I clicked with my wet finger. I quickly checked but was not satisfied with\
  \ the quality of the picture. Now more relaxed with a steadier finger, I was to\
  \ click when the intruding soldier surfaced. Judging my state, he picked my phone\
  \ and gave me a rude push towards the hilly road, I rejoined my team rejoicing.\
  \ They never knew my source of joy!"
