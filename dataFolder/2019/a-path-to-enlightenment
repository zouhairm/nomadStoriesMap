Text: "It was no later than early sunrise when filtered rays from sun stroked my face\
  \ and woke me up from the deep sleep. It had been an exhausting travel by bus for\
  \ 24 hours which put me to rest while we were on later half of our journey. The\
  \ moment i opened my eyes i was mesmerized by the view my eyes were seeing. The\
  \ breath taking greenery, huge mountains, water fall and cloudy weather were enough\
  \ to hit my soul. I had never felt so connected to nature and peace in my life before.\
  \ Another 16 hours of travel were exciting enough to keep us all energetic. We captured\
  \ every breath taking view, stopped at local restaurants and had a pleasure of meeting\
  \ people of local communities. \n       Finally, on reaching our destination that\
  \ is Hunza, Pakistan we checked in to our hotel room and had a good rest. The next\
  \ morning held an experience that i would cherish for the rest of my life. The weather\
  \ was cloudy and rainy. We completed our breakfast and went to wander over streets\
  \ to explore the place. We could feel the rainy droplets and breathe fresh air.\
  \ The place was devoid of any pollution and everything seemed so real and fresh.\
  \ I could feel physically active and mentally healthy. We went to local markets,\
  \ purchased their specialized embroidery shawls, went to gardens and fields and\
  \ had an experience of climbing trees and getting freshly ripened fruits from the\
  \ native people. One thing that i learnt that day was how to be grateful for the\
  \ blessings we have in our lives because this travel gave me the chance to interact\
  \ with people from diverse backgrounds who showed greater examples of hospitality\
  \ that will always be remembered. Talking with the elderly enlightened us with their\
  \ life experiences; a factor which we miss always in our technology based urban\
  \ lives. I could feel more connected to this world, to the nature. Everything was\
  \ so calm and peaceful that one\u2019s soul could feel refreshed. \n   Small markets\
  \ based on mountains had a unique infrastructure. Two way exchanges of sunlight\
  \ and air minimized the use of artificial energy resources. This idea was awesome.\
  \ We even had a chance to visit a wooden made house at the top of mountain. Red\
  \ colored carpets with bolsters were adding to the beauty. There, we were offered\
  \ Dou-Dou, the specialized soup of that area with macaronis and chicken. Trust me,\
  \ it was yum. On the same day, we visited a spot named as Duiker. OMG! I can\u2019\
  t even explain the beauty that place holds. It was an area completely covered with\
  \ mountains whose tips were full of snow. Naturally, the snow seemed to be of golden\
  \ color at the time of sunset owing to the geographical angle at which the sun sets.\
  \ The view appeared as a healer to mind and heart. \n   The next day came with another\
  \ exciting journey that had a touch of history and connection to the past. This\
  \ was marked by our visit to Baltit Fort, a place which was the identification landmark\
  \ of king and queen that ruled the place 700 years ago. It was astonishing to see\
  \ that belongings used by emperors were still intact and kept as souvenir. The fort\
  \ represented the entire picture of ruler ship in the previous eras highlighting\
  \ their prison system, their infrastructure, their crockery, clothing and a lot\
  \ more. Later that day, we had an experience of having moonlight dinner at mountainous\
  \ peak hosted by local residents followed by their traditional music by sitar and\
  \ dance. \n   Our visit ended on a meet up with people from fellow country \u201C\
  China\u201D on a Khunjerab border, world\u2019s most top and highest located border.\
  \ It was a place where two countries unite yet get separated by a common border.\
  \ The people on the other side were friendly and welcoming. The place had minus\
  \ degree temperature with snow all over. On our return we visited \u201CSost port\u201D\
  \ which is famous for trade purposes between two countries. The next morning was\
  \ our departure from Hunza and we came to our city with values and memories that\
  \ were bestowed upon us by the place."
