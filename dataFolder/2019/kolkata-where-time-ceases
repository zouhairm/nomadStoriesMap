Text: I am a bong, that means that I belong from the eastern part of India, that is
  West Bengal. Even after that, because my family had moved out of the region early,
  I could never get the chance to explore West Bengal and its capital Kolkata. When
  I finally visited the city of my roots, I was shocked, it was so much more than
  what I had imagined. I was standing in the city which saw major literary and religious
  revolutions of the country. The next three days, all I did was just walk around
  the city, soaking in to its flavour, it's delicious food and its welcoming people.
  The first day when I had food at a famous restaurant famous for its Bengali Thali,
  I had a foodgasm, it wasn't just good but reminded me of a home which always existed
  but never was. The best part of all the tours were the cheap jetty rides across
  the city. Under the magnificent Howrah Bridge the jetty sails across the mighty
  Hooghly river giving a panoramic view of the city and its reflection. Even not being
  from here, at the end of three days I felt this was the city to be there and I had
  found a second home.
