Text: "In Cairo, everything happens at street level. The oppression of heat is mirrored\
  \ in the oppressive complexity of the streets, in the endlessly austere and ramshackle\
  \ buildings that border them, in the myriad alleyways between them. However, like\
  \ water running effortlessly between huge boulders, the people of Cairo flow through\
  \ the streets with near-frictionless ease; the result is a near-constant sense of\
  \ motion, of deliverance, activity, hustle; people making their way, however they\
  \ can.\n\nOn a recent trip to Cairo I stayed in an apartment block approximately\
  \ half an hour from the city centre. I was dubious at first, but my friend and I\
  \ soon agreed that the location was a perfect way to start and end our days; the\
  \ madness of downtown was lessened out in the peripheries, and we could walk the\
  \ streets relatively hassle-free. The huge, dusty brown cubes would be Brutalist\
  \ masterpieces if situated in London; there they sit side-by-side as a raw practicality.\
  \ From afar they appear intimidating, blank, though the open windows, curtains,\
  \ and random dashes of colour from drying clothes gives some hint to human presence.\
  \ On approach they reveal a vibrancy at odds with their brutal exterior; colour,\
  \ activity and the hallmarks of a working community begin to emerge, their scale\
  \ becoming suddenly human. Children play freely, fixing us with inquisitive stares\
  \ as we passed, while adults walked calmly to and fro. Small shacks selling snacks,\
  \ drinks, cigarettes, fruit and chocolate, stayed open all night, and people relaxed\
  \ in caf\xE9s and small businesses, exchanging nods. We could appreciate this scale;\
  \ though still packed tightly together, there was more of a sense of space here,\
  \ giving us room, and time, to think.\n\nIn the centre we met guide after guide,\
  \ that whilst helpful, still had an air of the hustle about them. Out here, we found\
  \ a community less likely to take us for a ride. The bakers were easily the most\
  \ humble and friendly people we met, charging us next to nothing for the delicious\
  \ breads that we ate each morning, huge hoops drizzled with a thin sweet glazes\
  \ and sesame seeds, smaller rings snipped and stuffed with date paste, and small,\
  \ bite-sized pizza breads topped with olives and tomato. We remarked at their calm,\
  \ unphased attitude, their honesty and humbleness coming as somewhat of a relief\
  \ after the sometimes tricky interactions experienced elsewhere. And elsewhere in\
  \ the blocks we found a small place that gave us good coffee, mint tea and shisha\
  \ for fair prices - and, like the bakers, each return visit was appreciated.\n\n\
  Night, thankfully, falls quickly and early in Cairo, lessening the intensity of\
  \ heat over the city. After an hour or so of intermediate dimness, everything brightens\
  \ again as the darkness sharpens itself, and the city glows with artificial light.\
  \ A new ambience comes into being; the blankness of dust, adobe and sand is forgotten,\
  \ and the modernity of the country rears its head as technology propels the city\
  \ far into the night. A portable food stall served us Shwarma wraps with pickle,\
  \ fries, and a home-made tahini and chilli sauce, and on colourful plastic chairs\
  \ we were introduced to the others sat round chatting, smoking shisha, and sipping\
  \ cold drinks bought from the caf\xE9 nearby. We felt, with a little introduction,\
  \ that we were a part of the scene, not merely walking by.\n\nWith the mornings\
  \ again comes a beautiful sense of peace. We started our days in wandering through\
  \ the alleys, relishing the air, finding endless points of interest, seeing how\
  \ the people that lived and worked here carried out their daily activities. And\
  \ we remarked, on our last morning, how this was the most pleasant, relaxing part\
  \ of our stay; sitting in a small caf\xE9 on the edge of a block, chatting, drinking\
  \ mint tea and soaking in the morning like locals. That in the latticework alleyways\
  \ of Sheraton we found a place where we could witness the city\u2019s entire spectrum;\
  \ all of its adventure, intrigue, mystery, all of the bargaining, all of its hospitality,\
  \ with ease. It's easy to be hustled out of your money and your attention in Cairo;\
  \ take it at your own pace, and you'll find so much more."
