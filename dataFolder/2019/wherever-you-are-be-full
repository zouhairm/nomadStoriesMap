Text: "Traveling to the unknown place, against traditional tourist routes, was my\
  \ decision for the vacation of this year 2019. The objective was to leave a city\
  \ with more than a 6 million inhabitants (Rio de Janeiro) to one with about 6 thousand\
  \ inhabitants (Aiuruoca - MG). We were looking for a time already extinct in big\
  \ cities. In Rio de Janeiro, like most major centers, rules are articulated by capital\
  \ and power relations, time is short and brings people together in social medias\
  \ while driving them away in touch, smell and taste. We no longer know how to enjoy\
  \ a good food, because the lack of time conditions us to satisfy with fast food,\
  \ we no longer feel a deep and intelligent conversation, because what predominates\
  \ are superficial relations.\n\t Aiuruoca was the way to escape the urban chaos,\
  \ to meditate, to breathe and to slow down. Be in this city is to return to a time\
  \ when nature prevailed over human constructions. I really loved the countless waterfalls\
  \ of ice water, dirt roads surrounded by centenary green trees, the smell of wet\
  \ land after the afternoon rain, the taste of Minas Gerais food in Tia Iraci's clay\
  \ pot, a restaurant in the middle of a trail that seems endless, full of natural\
  \ obstacles, tree branches that seemed more like portals for happiness. \n\t People\
  \ from this place still look into your eyes and give a ride without suspect you.\
  \ On weekends, they go to a local square, whether for procession of a little church\
  \ in the center or to dance a \u201Cforr\xF3\u201D in the square. I met Pedro, a\
  \ local residence,  that always warned me of the rain  and always hit it, could\
  \ be blue sky, without clouds, and much hot, but when he said that it was going\
  \ to rain, he never made a mistake. Nobody better than the local people to understand\
  \ all the geographic dynamism. One tip, always listen to these teachings.\n\tDuring\
  \ the visit to the most beautiful waterfall called \u201CGarcias\u201D, we got bogged\
  \ down on the mud road so we decided to keep going. It was more than 9 miles step\
  \ by step moved by desire to get there. Good things follow bad things, so, in the\
  \ halfway I got a ride.They were three friends from S\xE3o Paulo city and their\
  \ 17-year-old dog called Honey. This moment was precious, because from this time\
  \ our connections emerged like a magic pass.\n\tIt was days of trails, waterfalls,\
  \ and the famous afternoon coffee, in a place that most resembled the Buddha's house\
  \ in Brazil. The connections intensified as we sat at the table, overlooking the\
  \ mountains that looked more like paintings. Listening jazz, smelling coffee, surrounded\
  \ by the green tones of nature, we just let our true being flow. We feel privileged\
  \ only to be in that place, because we were in a magic world full of exuberant landscapes,\
  \ new flavors, new friends, exchanges and connections. \n\tThese were days without\
  \ brush the hair, makeup, without high heels or expensive coats, none of that mattered,\
  \ prevailing an inexplicable sense of freedom. In my initial planning, I would pass\
  \ for four different cities, but when I arrived in Aiuruoca, I spent all days without\
  \ getting out of there. Anyway, sometimes we don\xB4t have go so far to find paradises,\
  \ everything depend on the way you look around and what you can extract from the\
  \ new connections. Everyone has something to teach and something to learn, and the\
  \ power of travel, comes from these interactions. Open your heart, and focus on\
  \ the present relationships, don\xB4t weep for the past and don\xB4t plan the future\
  \ too much, just be in full, no matter where you are."
