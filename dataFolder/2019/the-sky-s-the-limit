Text: "The plastic oxygen mask was clamped firmly over my nose and mouth, another\
  \ deep inhale. Thin, radiant green elastic straps attached to the mask differed\
  \ from the rusty forest green of the slender metal tank, which sat next to me faithfully;\
  \ a dog next to its master. I needed the loyalty of the tank \u2013 the feeling\
  \ of the oxygen reaching the depths of my lungs filled not only them, but me, with\
  \ relief.\n\n11,152ft above sea level, Cusco was to be our gateway town into the\
  \ 15th Century Incan citadel of Machu Picchu. The ancient ruins stand at a comparatively\
  \ paltry 7,970ft; my home town of Melbourne, Australia \u2013 a laughable 102ft.\
  \ I was determined that the beauty of Cusco would not be dampened by any physical\
  \ reaction to the unusual altitude. My husband Steve and I consider ourselves to\
  \ be relatively fit - we regularly run and are used to exertion. This however, was\
  \ no match for air so thin it felt as though we were underwater, sucking it down\
  \ desperately through thin straw snorkels of reed. I may have watched too many cartoons\
  \ in my youth.\n\nCusco is the Historic Capital of Peru. A UNESCO World Heritage\
  \ Site, the city hosts two million visitors a year. As I took another slow, deep,\
  \ breath, I pondered over how many of those two million were as lucky as me to have\
  \ found a saviour in their time of need.\n\u201CAll better!\u201D His voice lilted\
  \ upwards; I would discover that this was a permanent trait \u2013 he was ever positive.\
  \ His English was strong, our Spanish fairly poor.\n\u201CGracias\u201D I uttered\
  \ gratefully, \u201Cmuchos gracias.\u201D\nPerhaps it was ridiculous only hours\
  \ after arriving from Lima to have picked the steepest part of town to walk in,\
  \ cobbled road leading to an impossibly steep stone staircase, the flight a tower,\
  \ a challenge.\n\u201CI can\u2019t believe you convinced me to do this,\u201D Steve\
  \ had panted on the staircase as we stopped and sat for a third time on warm stones.\
  \ Beads of sweat slid from my hairline down the side of my face. It was rather difficult\
  \ to respond \u2013 the sun beat down, pounding against my fair skin and my chest\
  \ tightened; a hard pain rising against my lungs, a hand pushing from the inside.\
  \ We reached the top, achievement flowing over our exhausted, sweaty bodies. \n\n\
  The view of the old town was incredible \u2013 an ocean of terracotta rooves extended\
  \ down into the valley, the waves splashing all the way up the Andes range on the\
  \ far side. Houses on the mountain were dense, but trees and shrubs could still\
  \ be seen poking through, a concrete road wound precariously back and forth, making\
  \ its way up to and eventually over the apex. I couldn\u2019t breathe. I dropped\
  \ down onto the footpath heavily, \u201Clike a sack of potatoes\u201D flashed to\
  \ mind. Funnily enough, Peru produces over 3000 different potato varieties \u2013\
  \ a useless fact in that moment but in general quite incredible. I later asked a\
  \ tour guide just which of the 3000 was his favourite, \u201Coh, all of them.\u201D\
  \n\nOut of the cool darkness of a previously unseen wooden doorway, my hero appeared.\n\
  \u201CSenorita, necesitas ayuda?\u201D the husky voice enquired. This, I understood.\n\
  \u201CSi, si, I need help,\u201D I gasped, pointing toward my chest. Steve had been\
  \ getting me to slow down and breathe deeply. We were directed inside and I flopped\
  \ down onto a flowered couch. The man left the room and appeared back in a few seconds\
  \ with the oxygen tank on wheels.\n\nAs I thankfully gulped in the essential molecules\
  \ and began to feel better, I looked around the room. Walls and floor of unfinished\
  \ concrete. A few bright but worn tapestries hung, artwork. Two windows faced out\
  \ onto the street with panes of glass that I could see through the woven pink curtains.\
  \ But, another window on the side of the house was void \u2013 basically just a\
  \ hole in the wall. \n\u201CMi nombre es Luis,\u201D smiled the man, the start of\
  \ a beautiful friendship.\nIn Cusco, I\_realised how a small gesture can be of huge\
  \ importance and although all of our lives are very different, we all breathe. We\
  \ are all human."
