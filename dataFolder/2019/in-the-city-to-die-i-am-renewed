Text: "India is a country that I would like to visit from years ago but the rumors\
  \ of how unsafe this country was has kept me hesitated for quite sometime. Last\
  \ November, a friend invited me to join his trip to India & I never knew that this\
  \ trip will be another turning point of my life.\n\nVisited 6 cites in 14 days trip\
  \ at the northern part of India, I can tell you for sure - all the bad rumors about\
  \ india are exaggerated. The people are friendly. Proud to say that I survived the\
  \ streetfood Challenge & they are delicious.\n\nThe historical buildings, culture\
  \ & stories are beautiful as what i\u2019ve read & heard. I initially thought that\
  \ this gonna be my photography trip but what I found is more than a picture can\
  \ tell. I found a missing piece of my soul, the emptiness that haunts me. The little\
  \ voice that I\u2019ve tried to avoid. \n\nIn this over-populated city name Varanasi\
  \ - the city where people wish to die at, I was faced with my denials. Varanasi\
  \ is believed as the sacred city to die. The Elderly & people with deadly sickness\
  \ comes to this 3500 years old city next to Ganges River & wait patiently until\
  \ his last breath left his lungs.\n\nWhen I arrived here, I was shocked by the noise\
  \ of the traffic. I actually questioned why people wanted to wait for his death\
  \ in such a loud & crowded city. \n\nCuriosity is the best guidelines to explore\
  \ new city. I asked tons of questions to our tour guide who is a brahman - a spiritual\
  \ leader in Hinduism as he tooks us to 4 hour walk in the small alleys of varanasi.\
  \ I didn\u2019t get the answer why one wish to wait for his death?\n\nWhile we enjoyed\
  \ some delicious lassi & dosa in those alleyways, once every 10-15 minutes, a group\
  \ of India men carrying the corpses will pass us by. You have to get use to this\
  \ daily routine here. Not only the Hindus wish to die here in Varanasi, The Buddhist\
  \ is not different since here in Varanasi, there\u2019s this place called Sarnath\
  \ - one of the 4 holy places of Buddhism.\n\nI am a Buddhist & visiting Sarnath,\
  \ the Deer Park where Lord Buddha gave his first teaching is one precious moment\
  \ for me. This place has a heavy positive energy that I can\u2019t describe in words.\
  \ Of course, when you visit the deer park, reading Lord Buddha first Sutta (preach)\
  \ is an obvious wish. \n\nI tried to google the first Sutta but I can\u2019t remember\
  \ the title. I ended up reading some other sutta which I accidentally saw in a temple\
  \ nearby. The Sutta tells about a villain who has killed 999 people & about to make\
  \ Lord Buddha his 1000th victim. \n\nIt is not first time reading this Sutta. But\
  \ i guess the combination of positive energy & My unanswered curiosity, this Sutta\
  \ slap me real hard when i read how Lord Buddha question the Villain, \u201CI have\
  \ stopped, Why haven\u2019t you?\u201D\n\nI have a great career, a nice apartment,\
  \ comfortable car & showered with lots of love from family, friends & colleagues.\
  \ I am happy But I keep feeling unsatisfied with my life. The Line \u201CWhy haven\u2019\
  t you stopped?\u201D Hits the right buttons - My unsatisfied heart. It hit me so\
  \ hard that i started to cry. I cried because I realize it is my source of depression\
  \ & I cried because i am relieved to know that I understand & ready to become a\
  \ better version of me.\n\nFunnily, I even understand why waiting for your death\
  \ is something the elderly & dying patients want to do. If you are ready to face\
  \ your death in peace, you have live enough to left no regret. I am a new person\
  \ that day onwards. I even feel that i am emotionally very stable. I am not easily\
  \ provoked nor angry. I even proposed my long time best friend whom I friendzoned\
  \ for 9 years.\n\nSimply because now I know - being peace with yourself is the only\
  \ way to be happy. Being grateful is the only way to feel fulfilled. And he will\
  \ be my best friend & best partner for life."
