Text: "Growing up, I was used to sitting tight and bored on the road for several hours\
  \ with my parents. We would take many road trips in America, spanning from the north\
  \ to the south to the mid-Atlantic region to Canada to see city tourist attractions\
  \ and national historic sites. My parents fell in love with America, especially\
  \ since I was born to two immigrant parents. This land of opportunity meant more\
  \ diversified cultures and places to learn about, but as a child, I was not fond\
  \ of road trips. I suffered from motion sickness and did not acknowledge the excitement\
  \ that it brought upon my family. Since our transfiguring move to New Jersey to\
  \ Arizona last year, the opportunity to take more road trips as a family began again.\
  \ \n\nThat's when we discovered Arizona did not just have The Grand Canyon but two\
  \ other national parks and several other national monuments. We also found out there\
  \ are many routes from the state to get to other national parks in other states,\
  \ creating actual excitement in my adulthood than any textbook can introduce or\
  \ what my childhood road trips consisted of.\n\nMy love affair of visiting national\
  \ parks extended to 7 parks within the span of a year. Visiting these national parks\
  \ opened up my eyes about how these one-of-a-kind mountains, badlands, and canyons\
  \ all came to life. There are tremendous lands to discover that vary in America,\
  \ especially on the western side of the country. Was I finally coming to understand\
  \ why my parents loved road trips?\n\nOn my 23rd birthday, I went to my first national\
  \ park: Grand Canyon National Park. Its immense landscape wowed me with its deep\
  \ layers of red rock in the canyon that appeared to glow brighter in the distance\
  \ and I learned that there\u2019s 40 identified different layers of rock that formed\
  \ millions of years ago. There are also 11 associated Native American tribes that\
  \ consider the Grand Canyon as home. The physical attraction of the Grand Canyon\
  \ and these facts that kept adding up as I read upon the visitor centers and plaques\
  \ that are scattered through the park made me hungry for more knowledge, for more\
  \ discoveries. \n\nAfter a visit to the Grand Canyon, my family and I took a road\
  \ trip from Arizona to California to explore Joshua Tree National Park. I only saw\
  \ Joshua trees once from Arizona to Nevada back in 2016, but I learned so much more\
  \ about them in this one visit alone: they\u2019re only found in the Mojave Desert\
  \ and the story behind its name was inspired by their shape and reminded a group\
  \ of Mormon settlers of a Biblical story of Joshua and his hands. \n\nAfter Joshua\
  \ Tree National Park, there was Rocky Mountain National Park, Death Valley National\
  \ Park, and so forth. I was planning a national park trip after national park trip\
  \ because it had answered some of my curiosities about the country and what made\
  \ the park unique upon hearing other travelers\u2019 experience of national parks.\
  \ They do not only serve as tourist attractions, but they serve us reminders about\
  \ conservancy. The National Park Service has been protecting these lands and preserving\
  \ these biodiversities for over 100 years. Their work is focused on keeping these\
  \ around for many generations to come. \n\nThere are so many flora and fauna (even\
  \ endangered species) that are hard to come across but make themselves known in\
  \ national parks. A lot of these national parks emphasize the efforts to conserve\
  \ and remind us to leave these places better than you found them. National parks\
  \ are so educative to both the youth and elder and it transformed my perspective\
  \ on history, geology, and ecology. I came to the realization that I wanted to see\
  \ these natural wonders in my country to fulfill a constant desire to seek more\
  \ of the wilderness and solve some mysteries in my head. It all had a touch of humanity\
  \ after all.\n\nMaybe that\u2019s what took me so long to truly love road trips.\
  \ As a visual learner, I was finally making connections to the lessons taught in\
  \ textbooks."
