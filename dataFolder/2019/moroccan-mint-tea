Text: With the blue and white city in the distance behind my small group and I, we
  headed further into the mountains surrounding Chefchauen. Our path was made of pebbles
  and dirt. The fields on either side of us were filled with goats, encapsulated by
  stone walls.  We started passing local's homes and farms as we made it further into
  the mountains.  An older woman who was harvesting mint leaves from her garden saw
  our group, and waved us over to her. Our tour guide translated for us, and told
  us that she would like to invite our group of eight into her home. Out of the Moroccan
  custom of hospitality, she told our tour guide she wanted to serve us all mint tea.  As
  our tour guide translated for us, we learned that she was 73 years old, lived alone,
  and had no family in the area. We could tell that she didn't have much, but she
  shared everything she had with our small group - mint tea, olives and bread. It
  was so heartwarming and beautiful. Although we couldn't speak to her directly, we
  could tell that she just wanted our company. We all sat around a small table, drinking
  our tea, and eating our bread. The woman was smiling,laughing and was simply happy
  to have company sit with her. We finished up our tea and olives, and it was time
  to move on if we wanted to finish our hike and make it back to the city center by
  noon. As we left her house and said our goodbyes with hugs and hands held, I thanked
  her with tears in my eyes. To have such a personal connection with a virtual stranger
  who couldn't communicate with us was such a humbling experience, and one I will
  never forget.
