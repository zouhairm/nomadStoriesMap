Text: "Ignorance is bliss or so the saying goes. Volunteering in Fiji was an incredible\
  \ experience, however the trip showed me far more of the country, than the superficial\
  \ island paradise I was promised. Feeling happy with my life and the world, I decided\
  \ to share my happiness by travelling to Fiji to work as a volunteer teacher in\
  \ late 2018. From what I'd seen on the television and in travel magazines, Fiji\
  \ seemed heavenly, with its white beaches, beautiful clear waters and friendly locals,\
  \ I was instantly hooked. The reality though was far different from the media and\
  \ my na\xEFve imaginings.\nHaving just spent a delightful seventeen hours in Brisbane\
  \ airport, I boarded my boarded my plane to Fiji in a state of excitement (and slight\
  \ insanity). Bula is Fijian for hello, and boy did I feel very welcome, it seemed\
  \ people were popping up from all sorts of placing saying hello. I was immediately\
  \ greeted by the high humidity at Nadi (pronounced Nandi) airport. Despite landing\
  \ at three in the morning, we a group of motley and exhausted travellers were met\
  \ with some suspiciously happy Fijians who merrily serenaded us through customs.\
  \ \nBefore our volunteering could begin we couldn't miss out on the New Years Eve\
  \ celebrations, for me this meant travelling by bus from our hostel to a secluded\
  \ resort. The resort did not disappoint, the beaches were white, the ocean was blue,\
  \ and we even had baby sharks swimming near us when we summoned the bravery to walk\
  \ out to the reef. As the sun set our new year revelry began, and by the early morning\
  \ we'd all gathered to go swimming (fully clothed I might add) and talk about the\
  \ deeper life questions. Questions such as: did anyone else notice that our waiter\
  \ bore a close resemblance to a waiter in the Australian version of Love Island?\
  \ Deep indeed. \nThe honeymoon had to end though, we couldn't laze about on a beach\
  \ and call it volunteering forever, so reluctantly we dragged ourselves back to\
  \ reality. After hiking back to the main road, we managed to hitch a ride with a\
  \ friendly mini-bus driver. In Australia were taught early about accepting help\
  \ from dubious people, there are plenty of stories of Aussies who've innocently\
  \ been caught up in crimes, but the guy seemed friendly, and I don't any of us were\
  \ prepared to wait for much longer on the boiling hot tarmac. People who say Italian\
  \ drivers are crazy have obviously never been in a car with a Fijian. We weren't\
  \ ten minutes in when both myself and my friend were regretting having jumped so\
  \ eagerly into the front seats. One of the blessings the back seat passengers had\
  \ was that they couldn't see just how fast our driver was going, or how close he\
  \ came to killing us all in an accident, not once but several times. This happy\
  \ travelling was soon interrupted however when we were pulled over by a police car.\
  \ We all collectively held our breaths as the officer moved around our vehicle,\
  \ despite his scrutiny we couldn't have expected what happened next.\nBy and by,\
  \ the officer asked our driver to open his boot, a request that our driver refused.\
  \ It gets worse though, the officer then asked the driver to walk with him to his\
  \ car, and we still stuck in the increasingly stuffy mini-bus guessed what our driver\
  \ was hiding. As luck would have it, one of our fellow passengers was a Queenslander\
  \ who was Fijian by birth. He told us matter-of-factly, that our driver was probably\
  \ paying the officer a bribe. Our group of hungover volunteers all looked at each\
  \ other and knew we definitely weren't in Kansas anymore. With a grin that only\
  \ comes from paying a bribe to the law enforcement, our driver merrily jumped back\
  \ behind the wheel and our smuggling mission continued. Like seasoned drug mules,\
  \ we accepted our driver meeting with another driver to pass on his 'goods', in\
  \ a lamb-like fashion. Back safe and sound at our hostel our group wanted to make\
  \ sure if our story reached international news our group would be known infamously\
  \ as the 'Suva Six'."
