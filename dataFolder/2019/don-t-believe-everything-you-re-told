Text: "If you heard about Venezuela, probably the first thing that pops into your\
  \ mind is violence, economic crisis and definitely not people having a good time.\
  \ \nWhen I told my mom I was traveling alone to Venezuela without an itinerary she\
  \ started crying. Even the first Venezuelan I met in the plain told me I was crazy,\
  \ but immediately gave me her phone number in case I felt at risk. That\u2019s one\
  \ of the beauties of this country: \u201Clos venezolanos\u201D, the kindness and\
  \ warmth even when they are feeling helpless. \nI was supposed to meet with Cesar,\
  \ a friend\u2019s friend that had to pick me up at the airport on the 30th of December,\
  \ just one day from New Year Eve. I wasn\u2019t sure where my 2015 was going to\
  \ start, but I knew it was going to be in the right place. Cesar never appeared,\
  \ but instead Raymundo came for me, ready to go for some arepas as we came closer\
  \ to the center of Caracas. Colors, smells, heat, noices, could be the description\
  \ of most of third world country cities. But since I arrived to Venezuela, I felt\
  \ something special, unique, privileged. So many few people get to know this amazing\
  \ country, why me then? \nI finally got to meet Cesar, who immediately wanted to\
  \ know what was I expecting of this trip. \u201CDo you want to go to Isla Margarita?\u201D\
  \ he asked. I wasn\u2019t sure, I had read that Margarita was packed during the\
  \ holidays and probably was much more expensive than other beaches. \u201CHave you\
  \ heard about the Gran Sabana?\u201D continued as he realized I wasn\u2019t convinced\
  \ about the first destination. \u201CNo\u201D I replied and suddenly I knew I was\
  \ going for an unknown adventure.\n18 hours driving non-stop to Santa Elena del\
  \ Uair\xE9n. The longest trip I had ever done by car, without stopping with a complete\
  \ stranger I had met only a day ago. But we had to arrive for the traditional dinner\
  \ of New Year's. Cesar had brought \u201Ctamales\u201D cooked by her grandma and\
  \ we had already bought some cold beers to feast until midnight. \nNext time I looked\
  \ at my watch it was 7 am on the 1st of January of 2015. We had completely fallen\
  \ asleep! Cesar jumped from his sleeping bag and shouted we had to start moving;\
  \ the first day of the year had to be well-spent. We walked for an hour not knowing\
  \ very well where we were going until suddenly I felt the magic. \u201CEl abismo\u201D\
  , in english the abyss, was our destiny. An indescribable view of the Canaima National\
  \ Park, right where Venezuela and the Brazilian Amazonia meet. So much green wherever\
  \ you looked around and I couldn\u2019t stop thinking this was just the beginning.\
  \ And it actually was just the first of many days I traveled around Venezuela as\
  \ I met so many incredible people that opened the doors of their houses without\
  \ asking for anything in exchange. \nI love you Venezuela, you will always have\
  \ a piece of my heart."
