  t party too much!\u201D\n\n\u201CWhat? That\u2019s awesome!\u201D\n\nThese were\
  \ just some of the things people kept saying to me when they knew I was headed to\
  \ Barcelona for a 6-month internship at the age of 19.\_\n\nOn the surface, it seemed\
  \ perfect. \_\n\nI was going to be spending half a year in one of the most beautiful\
  \ cities in the world. I was going to be having tapas and sangrias everyday.\_I\
  \ was going to start my mornings at beautiful cafes in the city.\_I was going to\
  \ be right on the beach facing the Mediterranean Sea.\_I was going to be working\
  \ in a 5-star luxury hotel which was an incredible opportunity to land.\n\nHowever,\
  \ I did not start my internship with all these expectations, simply because I had\
  \ no idea what to expect.\_\n\nI had never moved out of the family home in Singapore\
  \ before, never mind overseas.\n\nI had never worked in a different country before,\
  \ and I did not know anyone prior to moving to this huge city.\_\n\nOh, and my Spanish\
  \ was barely there.\_\n\nAnd what was Spain like when I got there?\_\n\nHonestly,\
  \ I\u2019d never grown up so quickly and so much in such a short period of time.\_\
  \n\nYou only become an adult, whatever that means, when you're forced to, I think.\n\
  \nI'd never been so independent before in my life, and that feeling of being young\
  \ and free in every sense of those words was incredibly liberating.\_I felt waves\
  \ of emotions I had never felt before because I was in so many new situations and\
  \ experiences.  I was constantly self-reflecting if I found myself reacting a certain\
  \ way in a situation I\u2019d never found myself in before, and because of that,\
  \ I learned a great deal about myself.\n\nTruth is, when I started my life there,\
  \ all I wanted was one friend.\n\nThat did not happen.\n\nI ended up making so many\
  \ more acquaintances than I ever thought I would, and that was something I honestly\
  \ struggled with.\n\nThe thing about moving away from everyone you know back home\
  \ is that when you feel low and need a listening ear, whoever you used to rely on\
  \ for emotional support in the past is sleeping because it's 3am where they are,\
  \ or they might be out with plans and unavailable. In that moment you are then forced\
  \ to deal with your problems on your own. \n\nI don't think I had ever felt loneliness,\
  \ the way I felt in Spain.\n\nThankfully, by the end of my internship, I had managed\
  \ to build a solid community of friends that were more than just people I went to\
  \ work or partied with.\_I had built a routine for myself I had eased into. I was\
  \ more comfortable speaking Spanish, and I had restaurants and cafes I loved with\
  \ employees that recognised me and remembered my orders. I had a regular barber\
  \ I went to who would check in on how I was getting on and how much my Spanish had\
  \ (or had not) improved. It was all these small things about my life in Spain, that\
  \ made me feel like I had really found a piece of home in Barcelona. It's something\
  \ I had never really felt before, and will be something I continue searching for\
  \ in the future, whatever city or country I move to.\n\nSpain taught me that home\
  \ does not have to be the place you were born, the place you were raised, or the\
  \ place you are currently living in. Home is a feeling. \n\nSpain taught me that\_\
  I want to experience what life has to offer. I want to meet new people and be immersed\
  \ in different cultures and lifestyles. I want to feel like I am constantly learning\
  \ more things about life and myself faster than my brain can really process and\
  \ put into words. I want to do it not because I can say I did it to anyone else,\
  \ but to really feel like I am living."
