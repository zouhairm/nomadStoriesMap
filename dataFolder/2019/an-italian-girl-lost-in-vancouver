Text: "I was going through a difficult time in my life. I struggled to understand\
  \ what was best to do, what decision to take and in the meantime I shut myself up\
  \ more and more inside those four walls I called home.\nWhen you find yourself in\
  \ front of a crossroads, the only thing to do is to leave for a new adventure and\
  \ forget everything. Turn off your phone and totally immerse yourself in a new reality.\
  \ And so I did. I left Italy for Vancouver. \nI took the first plane and left. I\
  \ arrived in Canada in January and could not enjoy the city until April, when the\
  \ first rays of sunlight came to illuminate the beautiful Vancouver. A city with\
  \ many places to visit that was spoiled for choice. I started with nature, from\
  \ North Vancouver and explored Deep Cove, located at the foot of Mount Seymour.\
  \  I decided to hike Quarry Rock . The Powell Trail leads to this point offering\
  \ views of Indian Arm and the mountains around Belcarra. Then I moved to Lynn Canyon\
  \ Park for a quiet walk and admired the famous suspension bridge. Last naturalistic\
  \ stop was Grouse Mountain, the perfect place for spotting some bears. \nI decided\
  \ then to take advantage of the warm days to relax on the beach and play volleyball.\
  \ From Kitsilano Beach to English Bay.\nI've always been curious about seeing the\
  \ city from above, at 360 degrees. It is something that fascinates me. 44 floors\
  \ in total. 653 steps to reach the top of Lookout, the tower that is the mistress\
  \ of the city. A breathtaking view of the city. At that moment I felt very small\
  \ but it was worth it.\nVancouver is also very keen on it's local producers and\
  \ a visit to Grandville Island was mandatory for me. A giant market overlooking\
  \ the river and the Lion Bridge. Wide choice of international cuisines and a homely\
  \ atmosphere.\nLiving in Vancouver also means experiencing it's night-time part\
  \ and immersing yourself in the characteristic places of Gastown while admiring\
  \ the steam clock that whistles every 30 minutes. I was greeted by a thousand lights,\
  \ street musicians and smiles. \nI also wanted to try the younger part o the city,\
  \ so I tried one of the clubs in Granville street. Reggeton and Latin American music\
  \ but also Justin Bieber'songs of course. \nVancouver cuisine never makes you bored.\
  \ Every day I tried a different cuisine, from Thai, Indian, American and German.\
  \ When I felt homesick I used to go to Marcello's Commercial Drive for pizza, from\
  \ Bibo to Kitsilano to taste the linguine with seafood and tiramisu and from Robba\
  \ da Matti for a delicious panna cotta.\nTraveling alone makes you discover your\
  \ limitations and weaknesses, but allows you to love yourself and believe in yourself\
  \ more. \nThanks Vancouver for everything, see you soon my dear."
