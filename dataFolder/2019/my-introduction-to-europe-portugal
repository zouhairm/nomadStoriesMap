Text: "So here I was a student from India , studying in BERLIN & with a dream of going\
  \ around Europe in the next two years. And my first introduction to what Europe\
  \ was like happened in Portugal . I used couch surfing to get in touch with a family\
  \ in Faro , Portugal. When I did that , I never knew this could be an life changing\
  \ experience ever. So here I was sharing a couch with an unknown family in a small\
  \ island in the corner part of the world, is a big thing for someone who\u2019s\
  \ never been international except for studies. I realised what life is like when\
  \ I spent two or more days with them. The first thing I learnt was to be grateful\
  \ of every good or bad experience in life, it only makes you better. Secondly ,\
  \ of accepting of cultures , I noticed how I then understood the different perspective\
  \ of my own country they had , and I couldn\u2019t agree more. It taught me that\
  \ people should embrace all of good and all of bad of a culture or a country. Thirdly\
  \ of making travel better, a little thing you do for someone who is being there\
  \ , in your land could make the other persons day. Like they made a lot of salad\
  \ for me and I bought them ice cream for deserts. This was all a big thing for this\
  \ 23 year old to take. That\u2019s when I felt , that I\u2019m in Europe embracing\
  \ cultures, accepting people and was full of gratitude of what was happening to\
  \ me. Now regarding the country, I like Portugal more then Berlin (where I stay)\
  \ because it\u2019s got that Raw feeling about it , people are more relaxed , the\
  \ places more and more calmer , neat and it feels like you travel to find yourself\
  \ in those streets in faro , portimao or Benagil caves. This has been truly a enriching\
  \ experience of my life. It was more about the people , culture then it was about\
  \ the place. Portugal lives on in me .\n\nTo end this , I would say some trips change\
  \ you , and some change your life . This one did the latter.\n\nThanks for asking\
  \ this. I\u2019m glad I could write the other version of it from the already written\
  \ one in my diary.  \n\nCheers"
