Text: "After being robbed of everything I had by a taxi driver,\_a new guitar baught\
  \ for me by an american. I'm back in the Barranco district with a smile and much\
  \ music for everyone. Walking lightly.\n\n\_I found a cheap quiet hostal, had a\
  \ relieving shower, and ate. There was a party In the Barranco; but I wouldn't know,\
  \ I was sound asleep. I awake and wonder what lays in store next, I've learned not\
  \ too try, that it's easy to live in survival when you have nothing, your constantly\
  \ pulled by the forces that guide you; but when you have comfort, you have choices,\
  \ and those choices lead to different directions. How do you make them? And if you\
  \ dont try, you now just fade into life. There is a lesson, it's not about stuff,\
  \ it's about, lucky I'm not forever stuck in Lima painting houses and sleeping in\
  \ a bush; not that theres anything wrong with that.\n\n\_Despite myself being very\
  \ tired of the chaos of a city,(I have never liked them much.) The hostal is very\
  \ nice and quiet. Not excited I need to spend 2 more days here, I have nothing I\
  \ would like to do but play guitar in a park, so that's what I will do.\n\n\_ \_\
  \ \_ Of course, luck has it, playing in the park, who do you meet but; a 1 in a\
  \ million street junkie, who speaks half English and as I got to know him find he\
  \ lives be actual true honest morals, his friends; not so much. I bought him rum\
  \ and and shared my smokes, in return he showed me the other side of the town, the\
  \ unsafe parts for a Canadian; but I was adorned to his wolf pack, and he kept me\
  \ local, and showed me the darker side of the streets in lima. \_\n\n\_\_Now I know\
  \ the system, the real prices, the real places, the real people. His wolf pack,\
  \ a gangly crew from around the world, a Turkish fellow; the classic wreck, the\
  \ alpha; an Italian with his flesh melting off from infection, a miniature Peruvian\
  \ suave coke fiend, the Scottish happy scientifical chemical head, the accentric\
  \ and emotionally unbalanced bracelets weaver, the Argentinian tyke with big dreams\
  \ and only a pair of socks and shorts. I cant forget philipo, the completely crazy\
  \ fortune teller who told my past to perfection, this moment to a T, and my future\
  \ to be.\n\nI was given 3 shirts by a guy in the hostel which didnt fit him anymore;\
  \ having no bag, i brought them the shirts. The happiness.. Tore at them like dogs\
  \ after a bone. Later, I was taken by suave peruvian guitarra aficionado Julio,\
  \ to be shown how they busk here, walking to the park, right up to targeted people\
  \ and playing a song, dropping the hat and persisting in them to drop him money.\
  \ I couldnt do it, \"not my style\" I said, I went and made a few sol in 10 minutes\
  \ on the corner with passerbys while he ended up sweetening this quite beautiful\
  \ Chilean girl on a bench.\n\n\_\_\_\_\_Back in the wolfpacks park, we sang and\
  \ drank, till much too late, where we all fell asleep except the few. (this is how\
  \ they keep safe, every night.) I woke up much later with everyone gone except my\
  \ friend, who sat there while I slept all night keeping watch, as he didnt want\
  \ me to get robbed of my guitar. I somehow fit in very well there because there's\
  \ always space in crazy minds. If need be, I would survive in this wolfs den, the\
  \ Barranco; but, that Is not my fate.\n\n\_I'm very greatful, though, those situations\
  \ are a slippery slope, I know from experience; best to dip in, and dip out. So\
  \ now I'm heading up-town to a hostel near the Canadian Embassy which opens tomorrow,\
  \ Monday January 21st, 2019.\n\nGood luck my crazy friends.\n\nMike Blann."
