Text: "Have you ever climbed on the time machine? \nEven if it might be strange, the\
  \ answer is affirmative and soon you will know the reason why!\nIn August 2011 I\
  \ was chosen by my German teacher to take part in a three week study holiday to\
  \ Berlin.\nI was excited but at the same time worried because it was the first time\
  \ for me to travel alone, although I used to travel abroad but with my family.\n\
  Every morning I attended my German lessons at school and then I was free to explore\
  \ the nice German capital together with a travel guide.\nAn experience I will never\
  \ forget is visiting Kreuzberg.\nWell, you readers would have expected to read such\
  \ popular loved attractions as Brandenburger Gate, Alexanderplatz or East Side Gallery...\n\
  Actually, I was really impressed by Berlin\u2019s cosmopolitan character and open-mindedness\
  \ by strolling through one of the city\u2019s most international and diverse neighborhoods.\n\
  Kreuzberg which is the littlest Berlin district is for excellence a symbol of an\
  \ unique and perfect mix between multiculturality and artistic vivacity. Here, in\
  \ fact,  many rebel artists and a great Turkish community live, so that it seems\
  \ to be in a little Istanbul with painted streets. Even the U1 subway line, which\
  \ runs through it, has been ironically renamed Istanbul Express!\nBeing a nonconformist\
  \ district, Kreuzberg lets its inhabitants claim their diversity as they prefer\
  \ by painting huge graffiti or murals, opening stalls at every street corner and\
  \ sometimes treating alleys as public baths.\nKreuzberg is not ashamed to show neither\
  \ its beauty nor its most unpleasant sides: its eccentric being is neither a source\
  \ of pride nor a lifestyle.\nI still remember that sunny Tuesday afternoon when\
  \ I walked on the banks of Maybachufer, a long channel crossing Kreuzberg and I\
  \ heard a hodgepodge of languages...\nIt was so incredible to mingle in the crowd\
  \  among stalls of the huge T\xFCrkischer Markt where the street vendors shouted\
  \ and the colors of fresh vegetables, fruits, cheese, sweets, household items got\
  \ confused with the glitter of belly dance clothes and the surreal parade of homemade\
  \ lamb wool slippers.\nMy curious eyes crossed those of some young women covered\
  \ by colourful hijabs and my sense of smell was inebriated with the pleasant spicy\
  \ smell of yummy Turkish kebab.\nAfter this fascinating full immersion in an oriental\
  \ world, sitting on the ground I enjoyed the music of street artists who were playing\
  \ in an improvised and tiny concert area overlooking the canal. Slow Arab melodies\
  \ gave way to extravagant punk symphonies, performed by boys with bicolour hair\
  \ locks  ridges.\nIn Kreuzberg, hairdressers definitely do not get bored and prejudices\
  \ are out of fashion!\nOne of the most picturesque areas of Kreuzberg is also Kottbusser\
  \ Tor metro station, because I had the feeling of being in Brooklyn, the most populous\
  \ and popular of the New York neighborhoods.\nKreuzberg reminds me of Brooklyn also\
  \ because it was a borderland: before the wall it was in the center of Berlin and\
  \ here it is possible to see Checkpoint Charlie, the point where many Berliners\
  \ lost their lives trying to climb over the wall.\nKreuzberg really was a pleasant\
  \ surprise because I had the feeling of crossing the barriers of time, living past,\
  \ present and future in few hours and in one place.\nNow I can really say I was\
  \ climbed on the time machine!"
