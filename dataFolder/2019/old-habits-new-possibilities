Text: "For at least a decade, I wanted to challenge myself to a \u2018no-fly year\u2019\
  , primarily for environmental reasons. Yet, I had never taken the conscious decision\
  \ to do so. There always seemed to be a good enough excuse to just buy that plane\
  \ ticket (to a conference, a vacation, visit friends or family). And there always\
  \ will be, I soon realized. \n\nIf I could go an entire year without flying \u2013\
  \ and not seeing my family, scattered across several countries only accessible by\
  \ air travel \u2013 all other environmental efforts seemed achievable. \n\n\nThe\
  \ Awakening\n\nIn April 2017, I had the opportunity to travel in Colombia where\
  \ I am originally from. My experience in the Sierra Nevada de Santa Marta, staying\
  \ with the Kogi people who warmly invited my partner and me to their homes, gave\
  \ me the motivation I needed. We spent four days in the middle of the jungle, saw\
  \ spectacular biodiversity, and shared with indigenous people.\n\nThis region is\
  \ home to four main indigenous groups: the Kogi, Wiwa, Arhuaco, and Kankuamo. Their\
  \ spiritual leaders are called mamos. These groups believe the Sierra Nevada is\
  \ the heart of the world: what happens everywhere is reflected here and vice versa.\
  \ The ecosystem here is changing rapidly, and the people are concerned with the\
  \ state of the natural world. \n\nWe had a chance to speak to a mamo and participate\
  \ in an ofrenda: a ritual to thank Mother Nature for all it provides and give back\
  \ in intention and action. This forever changed me. \n\nThat same week, we visited\
  \ some parts of La Guajira further north. Most places were completely empty, but\
  \ you could see that only a few days before it had been a busy place. We saw single-use\
  \ plastic all over the ground and in the water. It really shattered our souls to\
  \ see the state of this otherwise gorgeous backdrop. \n\n\nThe Decision\n\nUpon\
  \ my return, I was forced to cancel future air travel due to changes at work. After\
  \ initial resistance, I eventually realized I had been wishing for this all along!\
  \ It was then, that I made the decision to cancel all air travel for one year. \n\
  \n\nThe \u2013 many unexpected \u2013 benefits and opportunities\n\n-\tAfter deciding\
  \ to take the first step, ease comes naturally  \n\nAs with most things, making\
  \ the fist move requires the most courage. Technology helped me overcome my resistance\
  \ of being far away from my family over the holidays. It also enabled discovering\
  \ and remotely participating in professional events. \n\n\n-\tImproved bonding\n\
  \nMy partner and I travelled to many parts of the UK in our solar-powered van. This\
  \ meant not only seeing parts of the country I probably would not have otherwise,\
  \ but also gave us a new space and amazing experiences to grow as a couple. \n\n\
  -\tNew places to explore\n\nWe also took the van on the ferry to mainland Europe\
  \ and found phenomenal beaches to surf, whilst taking our room along! It really\
  \ is a more affordable way to travel too!\n\n-\tA journey of self-discovery\n\n\
  Changing this one thing, air travel, which most people did not even have access\
  \ to only a few decades ago, came with a few personal discoveries as well. First,\
  \ I decided I want to transition into van life for a year or two. \n\nI also got\
  \ rid of some of the pressure I had put on myself to travel all over the world.\
  \ In some ways, I prefer to avoid the inevitable damage that comes with tourism\
  \ and explore those places closer to home in more depth. \n\n\nMoving Forward\n\n\
  Without planning, or even expecting, this experiment had a lasting effect on me.\
  \ \n\nThough I have had to fly again to visit my family, it has become almost second\
  \ nature to look for low-carbon ways of travelling wherever I go. Air travel is\
  \ my last option when choosing how to get around. \n\nI have also met incredibly\
  \ interesting people when I travel. For some reason, airports and planes seem to\
  \ make people less communicative, or perhaps more stressed. \n\nIn a world where\
  \ we are always rushing, maybe slowing down our travel might help us reconnect in\
  \ better ways to others. And perhaps this is what is required to solve our biggest\
  \ challenges."
