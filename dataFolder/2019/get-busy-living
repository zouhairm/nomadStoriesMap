Text: "I am an adventurous traveller who has a special passion for culture, history\
  \ and self-discovery. My story is short in words but long in memories and experiences;\
  \ when I was 10 I lost my best friend of cancer and she made promise her to live\
  \ my life for the two of us... At 10 that seemed easy, so I continue to explore\
  \ and travel in order to honour her wish; I moved from Colombia to Australia by\
  \ myself when I was 17 to study English, 3 months later I fell in love with this\
  \ country and decided to stay and create a career. \n\nDuring those 4 years of the\
  \ degree, I work a lot and I also travelled more across Asia and Europe and then\
  \ I graduated as a Graphic and Product Designer. As my graduation present, I decided\
  \ to travel for 7 months, across New Zealand, south-east Asia and Africa were I\
  \ spend 3 months and a half volunteering at an orphanage and living with them and\
  \ by far the most amazing experience of my life, counting on the 2 times I almost\
  \ got killed in Kenya.\n\nAt the age of 21, I started to work at the same university\
  \ I graduated from, Griffith University on the Gold coast. I became a lecturer and\
  \ tutor for 4 design subjects, I LOVE my job, I get to teach people to see life\
  \ with open eyes and with love. As designers, we have a big responsibility, we are\
  \ allowed to be weird, creatives to use our imagination and let it flow and expand.\
  \ Helping and seeing people grow is my jam. My job allows me to take time off to\
  \ continue to travel, therefore, every year for the last 4 years I have been travelling\
  \ more and more., two, or three times a year, sometimes four or five...\n\nI have\
  \ been able to volunteer in Nepal for 2 months, spend a week diving in Vanuatu,\
  \  travelled across central America from Mexico to Colombia in 3 months, Volunteered\
  \ in Peru for six weeks, Walk across the Himalayas in India and travelled the Golden\
  \ triangle too. Visit Japan and China. \n\nAt this stage at the age of 28, I have\
  \ been to 43 countries, I recently build my very first house, I was able to designed\
  \ it all and make it my own representation. The material world is important to grow\
  \ and evolve as humans but the most important is not to forget to live while you\
  \ achieve your goals, being able to have a work, life balance is a MUST for everyone\
  \ nowadays. I like to merge myself into the culture and learn as much as I can,\
  \ I speak Portuguese, Spanish and English and I can happily say I am a good responsible\
  \ traveller who is committed to showing the world how beautiful our world is.  \n\
  \nMy love for discovery is currently also part of my studies, I am doing a masters\
  \ in research where the topic is global social responsible travellers and the job\
  \ we have every time we get into a new country. The idea behind is to be able to\
  \ teach others how to communicate and respond across cultures in order to have wonderful\
  \ experiences, and while we get to enjoy and live also help others in need. \n\n\
  Portugal has ALWAYS been my dream, I have never been but I would love to!  \n\n\
  12 years away from home as a nomad, I dont plan to stop anytime soon....\n\ninstagram\
