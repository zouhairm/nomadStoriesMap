Text: "When we are young we always wonder being getting lost in a wonderful or adventurous\
  \ place. So did we. Me and thre other friends \n\nEva! My German neighnour and friend\
  \ in India. She was here for a short internship when we got to know each other \n\
  \nGaurav! Old school mate returned back to India after almost graduating ( drop\
  \ out actually ) from Australia. \n\nAnd one known acquaintance from Poland. A sweet\
  \ and funny one. \n\nWe planned our trip to Nepal. I said yes instantly just out\
  \ of excitement and passion for traveling and exploring the world. Nepal was my\
  \ first country abroad to visit. \n\nGuess what? It was a fucking Road trip and\
  \ I was not even sure if would have enough money to travel until the 4 to 5 hours\
  \ before we left for Nepal\n \n\nSomehow I got the money and our adventure started.\
  \ \nTotally unplanned and no GPS. I guess that's how it was done and been more fun\
  \ and adventurous \n\nIndia and Nepal share four borders. We entered from Mahendranagar\
  \ border in the north west of India and Nepal. Perfect entry no hassle. \nOn the\
  \ way planned our first stop in Nepal which was Bardiya National Park. In a small\
  \ hatchback car we drive into a village and then towards our small resort crossing\
  \ a narrow river which was exciting and little terrifying as well. But we made it.\
  \ Without breaking the car. We followed one of the guide from the resort to take\
  \ us to oour accommodation. Evening started with some Nepali music, self cooking\
  \ ( a wild chicken ) and rice wine ( that's what they call it in some regions of\
  \ Nepal ) \n\nFirst morning In Bardiya National Park started with the wall through\
  \ the Jungle inhabitant to Tigers, Rhinos and Wild Asiatic Elephtans. \nIt makes\
  \ a journey memorable when you have excitement and curiosity and anxiety all the\
  \ same time. Imagine walking through a jungle just with a small stick in your hand\
  \ trying to sport wild animals like tigers and Rhinos. We were fortunate to spot\
  \ Elephants and Rhinos but no tigers. Thankfully Haha\n\nNext day we drove to Tansen.\
  \ A small town in Nepal. Lively friendly people. Lot of momos ( dumplings) which\
  \ you can find everywhere in Nepal.\n\nLater on our Next stop was pokhara. A popular\
  \ hill station in Nepal in the mountains and popular for adventure sports. \nWe\
  \ all chose one of the kind we like and not much scared of and so I went for river\
  \ rafting. \n\nIt's a perfect place for rafting and para gliding. \nStreets full\
  \ of restaurants and cafes with delicious Nepali and other cuisine. Exquisite handicrafts\
  \ at the local shops. \n\nFrom nature we moved to a bit of city life which is into\
  \ Karhmandu. Capital of Nepal. Nice pubs bars\nNearby places to explore like Bhaktapur\
  \ for a perfect sunset a d view of Himalyas. Trying the street food. Fried mushroom\
  \ with mustard sauce, beef tikka and much more. \n\nLive bands performing in the\
  \ evening at a few bars. Perfect end of a day after visiting wonderful architecture\
  \ of Nepal. Durbar square, seyambhunath etc."
