Text: "I come from a small country in Latin America, where the biggest city is one\
  \ with only 250,000 people. Thankfully, I had the opportunity to live in South Korea\
  \ for three years; which became the most unexpected experience of my life. During\
  \ my time there, I was able to try different sports like Korean sumo and taekwondo,\
  \ learn a new language, found a passion for Korean food, met a Korean prince charming\
  \ and even appeared on TV! \n\nThe most striking thing I found living in this country\
  \ was how detached from reality you can become once you start immersing yourself\
  \ in the culture. Suddenly, you start changing the way you dress, become obsessed\
  \ with beauty and Korean products and your behavior in public slowly, but surely\
  \ becomes \"Korean\". It is not just a once in Rome type of adaptation, you literally\
  \ see how people change and become superficial and do anything they can to become\
  \ a Korean. You can rarely step out of the norm and be who you want there, because\
  \ society will tell you that you will be more accepted if you start living their\
  \ way.\n\nThis all intensified once I met prince charming. He was everything the\
  \ dramas described: handsome, rich, conceited and with a dark side. Even standing\
  \ next to him became a social shock that caused stares and gossip wherever we went.\
  \ Being interracial myself, it reminded me of how my parents were looked at in Panama;\
  \ however, they always received positive comments and surprise once they saw me\
  \ and my sister. On the other hand, with him, I could not believe how negative and\
  \ scrutinized things became as we became closer. \n\nYou would think finding love\
  \ with a rich guy is every girl dream. Women strategize and even form schools to\
  \ find and date rich guys; this was not the case for me. I was struck by fate and\
  \ many times I underestimated prince charming due to my own disbelief of how surreal\
  \ life was for me. It was love, but just like in the dramas, the obstacles were\
  \ far greater for us and unlike in those stories, there was never a happy ending\u2026"
