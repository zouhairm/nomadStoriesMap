Text: "Entire cultures are struggling to stay alive.\nThere is a vast amount of knowledge\
  \ among the first Australians that remains untapped into, but it has so much to\
  \ give.\n \nAs I gaze up at the stars atop a rocky cliff overlooking Bass Strait,\
  \ I think of the people whose land this belongs to. Before we named Wilsons Promontory,\
  \ it was Yiruk or Wamoon. To the Boon Wurrung People, it is home.\n \nWe drove three\
  \ hours out of Melbourne and trekked all afternoon to get here.\n \nWe meandered\
  \ along the twisting path to reach the top of Mt Oberon; each windy turn inching\
  \ closer together the higher we climbed. We emerged from the treetops onto bare\
  \ rock that saw sparkling waters and golden sand of the bays sprawl out below. Despite\
  \ the hot sun on our backs, there were shrouds of mists surrounding the hills lower\
  \ down, blending a hot summer\u2019s day with a cold, misty morning. \n\nFrom the\
  \ top of the mountain, we could see our path laid out in front of us - we were to\
  \ head down the other side of the mountain and follow the curves of the bays. We\
  \ weaved our way down and walked for hours through the bushland on a track of only\
  \ dirt and sand. The sand ran between our toes, falling into the nooks and crannies\
  \ of our shoes and socks. The smell of eucalyptus oil rose into the as we crushed\
  \ leaves beneath our feet. \n\nSuddenly the bushes ruffled. A kangaroo bounded across\
  \ the track and disappeared into the shrubbery on the other side. Gone as quickly\
  \ as it came.\n\nBy the time we reached a creek that crossed our path, we were soaked\
  \ with sweat. It was such a relief to dip our hats into the water, pop them back\
  \ on, and feel the cool water trickle down our necks. We felt the heat evaporate\
  \ away from the top of our heads. \n\nWhen I finally saw water ahead, I ran towards\
  \ the sea. My shoes and clothes were off, dumped alongside my bag in the wet sand\
  \ amongst the sand crab holes, and I dived in. We reached Oberon Bay as the sun\
  \ was dropping in the sky and felt accomplished looking up at the towering mountain\
  \ we had just climbed down from. But we weren\u2019t done. \n\nWe followed the arch\
  \ to the point where the river and sea met and crossed barefoot. We walked along\
  \ the edge of the land, along a granite maze from beach to beach. The sand at Oberon\
  \ Bay was soft as it squished between our toes. Further north, the coarse grains\
  \ massaged our feet as we pattered across. The rounded grains of quartz at Squeaky\
  \ Beach were by far our favourite as it squeaked as our feet flicked up the white\
  \ sand. \n\nAnd now, here we sit. We had to run full-pelt up a nearly vertical rock\
  \ face to sit above the trees to watch the setting sun and emerging stars. Seals\
  \ pop their heads out of the water far below as black dots bobbing in the waves.\
  \ \n\nWe know it\u2019s going to rain. \nA Boon Wurrung Elder shares his warning,\
  \ pointing out the brightest stars in the sky. Against the black canvas of the night\
  \ sky, they appear blue and fuzzy. For generations, the first Australians have held\
  \ this wisdom that was only relatively recently stumbled upon by modern day astrophysicists\
  \ and meteorologists. The light from these stars is absorbed by the high humidity\
  \ in the air, and as the light travels through different pockets of air with varying\
  \ humidity, they twinkle different colours. These twinkling stars are therefore\
  \ a predictor of rain given to us by nature, if only we look up. \n\nThe indigenous\
  \ people of Australia have lived here for 65, 000 years. They have so much wisdom\
  \ to share but we never invited them to. We never embraced the crossroads of Aboriginal\
  \ knowledge and modern day science. \n\nAs I sit high up on the rocks, knowing that\
  \ the rain drops will fall on me soon and with so much science buried within the\
  \ stories of the stars above me, I feel only one thing: Barrbunin. Happy."
