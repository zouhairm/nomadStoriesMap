Text: "When I would meet my friends\u2019 grandparents, I always thought it was strange\
  \ that they did not have an accent. In Halifax of 2014, I learned to appreciate\
  \ why.\nStanding beside the ocean on a late August afternoon, my curls embraced\
  \ the salty air like a sponge, taking it all in and once again revealing my Mediterranean\
  \ heritage. A little late for suggestions, the flight attendant the day before had\
  \ warned us on the plane that this province was known for the rain; it experienced\
  \ precipitation on average 200 days per year. As we waited in line near the gate\
  \ of the pier, the sky begged to differ, and it seemed like it was too perfect,\
  \ or possibly unnecessary. The ocean was never-ending, seeing the horizon was a\
  \ serial experience for someone from the city. I was entranced by the water, I had\
  \ never seen the ocean before. Turning to my right, my grandmother was gazing too.\n\
  \"It looks like this all the time\", she said matter-of-factly. \"Every time I'm\
  \ here it looks like this.\"\n\"Nonna,\" I whispered, trying to get her attention\
  \ before more locals realized we were visitors. \"You've only been here twice.\"\
  \nAs the line began to move, she took hold of my hand and say it again. \"Every\
  \ time I'm here it looks like this.\"\nEntering the gates to the renovated museum\
  \ arm-in-arm, I wondered all the places her feet had traveled since she last stepped\
  \ foot here 55 years ago. \nThe museum was under construction the summer before,\
  \ in hopes to remove the curmudgeon feeling in the lobby. But that was unnecessary.\
  \ You could feel the energy absorbed in the bricks from the millions of immigrants\
  \ whose first welcome to Canada was this very building. This beast of a building.\
  \ Offering families to track their loved one's paperwork to the very boat they arrived\
  \ in Canada, it was like a pretend recreation of the journey they all had to face.\
  \ With my grandmother\u2019s presence, the feeling would be there indefinably.\n\
  As a second-generation Canadian, I always felt like a little bit of me was disconnected.\
  \ I had never visited my family's hometown, never seen the mountains in Calabria,\
  \ never tasted food from the south of Italy. The doors were an entranceway to a\
  \ whole new world for millions of people. Walking through the doors as we left the\
  \ tour, I felt like I understood my family more than I could ever imagine. \nMy\
  \ grandmother never graduated from high school, never really spoke English eloquently,\
  \ and still got confused about the internet. But that day she seemed brilliant,\
  \ in every sense of the word. \nWaiting for the bus to bring us back to the hotel,\
  \ Nonna continued to look off into the ocean, almost remorseful.\nIt's not possible\
  \ to see across the world, even if there is nothing in the way. The horizon was\
  \ simply an imaginary line that receded as you approach it. My logical brain knew\
  \ that to be fact. But as I stood with my grandmother beside the ocean at Pier 21,\
  \ I discovered that this was really where my family was from. The moment she walked\
  \ off that boat, my family became a possibility. Looking into the ocean as the sun\
  \ was beginning to set, could she see the Italian shore from here? Was she picturing\
  \ leaving her cousins and friends and grandparents behind all those years ago? Maybe\
  \ if she closed her eyes, she could still hear the slew of people speaking myriad\
  \ languages from every corner of the world with one thing in common. \nAnd as we\
  \ boarded the bus to continue our tour, was it her life or mine that flashed before\
  \ her eyes?"
