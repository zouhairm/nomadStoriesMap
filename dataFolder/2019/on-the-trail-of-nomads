Text: "I was born in Kazakhstan. During my life my family and friends always travelled\
  \ to European countries, Western Asia, like Thailand, India and others. I never\
  \ heard that someone travelled through Kazakhstan. No one even thought about it.\
  \ So never have I.\nOnce my friends from the US came to me and they told me to go\
  \ travelling with them. I said: why? What are you going to do here? It\u2019s boring!\
  \ I supposed we would go to trip for a couple days and I agreed for a trip through\
  \ Kazakhstan.\nI was totally wrong.\nDespite all the non-comfort it\u2019s really\
  \ great experience for me. My friends travel a lot. I opened the country from an\
  \ absolutely different side. It\u2019s like you live all your childhood in one place,\
  \ but you cannot even imagine that it is so colorful, extensive and beautiful.\n\
  I was so amazed by seeing the abundance of nature. We started our trip in Almaty\
  \ \u2013 big city which is surrounded by nature \u2013 hot weather in lowlands and\
  \ the snow in the higher points in mountains, local people will assure you \u2013\
  \ it\u2019s still possible to find the Snow Leopard in peaks of the mountains Alatau.\
  \ There is a small lake Issyk in the mountains where I felt the magic of nature\
  \ and purity. \nThen we went to Charyn canyon. Kazakhstani people are really proud\
  \ of it and consider it as a smaller Grand Canyon of Colorado. I\u2019ve never been\
  \ in US and don\u2019t know how looks like the Grand Canyon. But Charyn \u2013 I\
  \ was petrified that all my life I grew in this country and never expected to see\
  \ such beauty.\nAs our destinations in country located quite far from each other\
  \ we needed to stay in small villages where small amounts of locals still live.\
  \ Why they don\u2019t choose life in towns? \u2013 We want to be in unity with nature,\
  \ with our country and traditions. \nThese people will never refuse to help you:\
  \ give some water or food. They have a small farm where there are domestic animals,\
  \ single-handedly grown plants. That\u2019s the real discovery for me and my friends!\
  \ The always tell you how it\u2019s better to get the route or where a nice oasis\
  \ is (because on south and south-west of Kazakhstan it\u2019s almost a desert).\n\
  Not so far from Almaty there is a lake \u2013 Tuzkol which is translated as Salt\
  \ Lake. That lake is really salty!\nAs we found out this lake is one of the saltiest\
  \ lakes in the world after the Dead Sea and Great Salt Lake in the US. It was a\
  \ surprise and non-expecting experience \u2013 one of the locals recommend us to\
  \ visit it. It has a great view to Tien Shan (Kazakhstan shares its borders with\
  \ China). There aren\u2019t many tourists, so you can enjoy the tranquility of the\
  \ place and feel the moment.\nWe were travelling by car \u2013 which is the perfect\
  \ way to see the country. It is really interesting when you travel from south to\
  \ the north how the landscape changes. Once you watch the desert, later you see\
  \ the forest. \nThe steppe of Kazakhstan is full of interesting. You see unusual\
  \ insects, snakes, rodents. And they don\u2019t afraid the humans if they quite\
  \ far from each other, so you can watch them. \nWhat flowers are there! What colors!\
  \ Brown, green, blue, ruby \u2013 it\u2019s impossible to remember all of them.\
  \ I can suppose, it\u2019s a great place for an artist.\nWhen I came back home,\
  \ I was very impressed. I shared my travel story with my family and friends. I can\
  \ say that it changed me. It has changed my attitude toward my home country. Later\
  \ we travelled with my family to another part of Kazakhstan and that\u2019s a great\
  \ story too.\nWe live in our homes, cities, countries. We see our surroundings all\
  \ the time and we don\u2019t notice anything. We say that we need the change of\
  \ scenery for a holiday and we leave the country and don\u2019t have a desire to\
  \ open our eyes and live a home, but not so far\u2026 And if you do it, you can\
  \ change not only the scenery, but the picture of your life."
