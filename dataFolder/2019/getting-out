Text: "2015 Jan, 1st. A new year for a new leap, questing for the next phase of life\
  \ in the journey into a new state within the same country by road and it takes 12hours\
  \ and to make the journey a wonderful experience it has to only be photographic,\
  \ something that a thousand words can never narrate, money cannot buy and forever\
  \ bright in my soul of heart. \n\nI had a Nikkon Camera D330 with an attached zoom\
  \ lens with the zoom range of 50-300, so it can travel far while seeing exceptionally\
  \ beautiful nature, plane green field, mountains in their different sizes, waterfalls\
  \ and so on, I take pictures of every moment I had, different villages passed across,\
  \ cultural displayed and much more. \n\nTravelling by road can be stressful in such\
  \ a far distance but with my quest for future into another state and capturing every\
  \ moment that caught my eyes and attention, I photograph them, all these beautiful\
  \ natures I had never known I will see them with my eye through the photographic\
  \ lens.\n\nNothing beats what you have that money can't buy and those images captured\
  \ are my greatest treasures and asset, one of the best of the image was getting\
  \ to the entrance of the new state and have it captured was so good and have a series\
  \ of landscape got captured too. \n\nThe journey was worth it and in summary, I\
  \ had spent four years now in Port Harcourt Nigeria. I am a photographer, a graphics\
  \ designer, social media savvy for a football academy. The Journey paid so much\
  \ so far and I will love to travel by air and have some beautiful cities, oceans,\
  \ deserts, mountains, cultures and much more captured and document them.\n\nI am\
  \ Yisa Azeez Asipita."
