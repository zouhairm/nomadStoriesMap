Text: "Travelling is more than seeing the world.  It is more than deep sea diving,\
  \ falling out of the sky, and climbing mountains.  The dynamic adventures that captivate\
  \ and enthrall us are only the tip of the ice berg.   Travelling is the essence\
  \ of spiriting ourselves away into oblivion.  It is the essence of discovering new\
  \ layers in ourselves.  When we travel, we look into the eyes of strangers for intrinsic\
  \ understanding.  We seek to deepen connection, rather than escape.  As we scatter\
  \ ourselves across the globe, stamping our markings on maps like the stars mapped\
  \ across the sky, our roots grow deeper.  It is commonly misconceived that the traveller\
  \ uproots themselves and starts over each time they pack their bags to begin a new\
  \ chapter.  However, the traveller is a novelist.  The traveler knows that no matter\
  \ where they go, or who they meet, we are all reflections of one entity.  There\
  \ is always more than meets the eye.  The traveller bears an open mind, and sacrifices\
  \ the weight of pride in order to let the world into their heart.\n\nThe criteria\
  \ that constitutes a traveller is not found in experiences, or in our passports.\
  \  It is found in our hearts and our intentions.  I've known from a very young age\
  \ that I have an intense passion for learning/growing.  And by learning, I don't\
  \ mean sitting in a classroom and having someone's else's ideas fed to me.  I mean\
  \ constructing my own knowledge and understanding through my own experiences.  I\
  \ mean forming as many connections as I can, by living with my heart on my sleeve.\
  \ There is not a soul who doesn't have something to teach you. Last Summer I learned\
  \ so much through interpersonal connections.  Alien ground is the perfect cultivation\
  \ for stumbling into magic.  When we are blind, our remaining senses are strengthened.\
  \  When I didn't know where I was or what I was doing, I was at my most vulnerable.\
  \  And when you're in the position of vulnerability, you really zone in on what\
  \ matters to you and what doesn't.  You're essentially forced into channeling the\
  \ free thinker you have always been.\n\nThe most important thing I learned about\
  \ myself when I travelled across Canada with only bare essentials, is the imperative\
  \ of empathy.  I have always valued kindness, but the abyss I was thrusted into\
  \ ruthlessly demanded of me to question myself, and to question my own motives/intentions.\
  \  As I slowly depleted the quantity of belongings weighing me down on my back,\
  \ I discovered quality.  And I discovered how the greatest weight of all I bore\
  \ was the mask.  The mask I wore to appease others, and the mask I wore when I looked\
  \ at my own reflection.  I realized I was not forming authentic connections because\
  \ I was not honest with myself or anyone else.  I needed to let go of my fear before\
  \ the wind could spread my seed across fertile earth.  My travel story, is a story\
  \ of learning to let go. \n\nThe most important souvenirs I brought back with me\
  \ to Ontario were not rocks from the sea, or the fairy dust sand that made my bed\
  \ for many nights.  The most important souvenirs were not the things I collected,\
  \ but the sacrifices I made along the way."
