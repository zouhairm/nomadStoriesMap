Text: "French cuisine always seemed untouchable. The French have mastered the art\
  \ of cooking, and are placed on a pedestal by the rest of the world. So of course,\
  \ when I headed to Paris for the first time in 2014, I was looking forward to eating\
  \ as much as I could, wherever I could afford.  Food is always something I have\
  \ enjoyed. Coming from an Italian background I was brought up understanding how\
  \ even the simplest of ingredients can create the most amazing meal. However, I\
  \ left for Paris with the mindset that the more expensive the food, the better it\
  \ would be. While this is sometimes true, my time in Paris taught me otherwise.\n\
  On one particular day, our group started at Notre Dame, headed to the Muse\xE8 du\
  \ Louvre, and walked along the Seine to the Eiffel Tower. By the time we were sitting\
  \ on the lush grass staring in awe at the iron beauty before us, there was only\
  \ one thing on our minds: food. The hunt was on. We were walking for what felt like\
  \ hours. Finally, we found a quiet little bistro nestled in an alley by the Seine,\
  \ under the shadow of the Muse\xE8 D\u2019Orsay. We exchanged pleasantries with\
  \ the waiter in all the French we knew, which was not very much, and sat down excited\
  \ to finally eat. When you\u2019ve been walking all day in the hot August sun, you\
  \ don\u2019t care how much things cost. You only know that you want to eat and want\
  \ to eat now. We ordered escargot, coq au vin, charcuterie boards, not to mention\
  \ baskets upon baskets of bread. \nBy the end of the meal all of us were full and\
  \ talking about how perfect our day had been. Then came the bill. Two hundred and\
  \ seventeen Euro. Our jaws hit the floor. Was the food good? Yes! Was it worth each\
  \ of us forking over nearly eighty Canadian dollars good? Definitely not. \nA week\
  \ later, my friend and I were walking around Paris again and we were famished. What\
  \ to eat, where to go? It was nearing 2pm on a Tuesday and everything was about\
  \ to close up for the afternoon, thanks to the laidback Parisian lifestyle. We needed\
  \ to find something- and quick. Then we saw it: a beautiful small park located across\
  \ the street from a grocery store. We ran into the store and grabbed everything\
  \ we could: baguettes, meats, cheese, tomatoes, a few pains au chocolat and a bottle\
  \ of wine. It was a decent haul, and the grand total? Twenty euro. Our wallets thanked\
  \ us. \nWe made our way to the park to find that the rest of Paris had the same\
  \ idea as us; a picnic in the park. We sat in the grass and indulged. Failing to\
  \ get a knife for the tomato, my friend cleaned off her house key to cut it, they\
  \ were desperate times indeed. We talked and laughed with kind strangers who explained\
  \ that while my friend and I had this spur of the moment idea, picnicking in the\
  \ park is an everyday activity for Parisians. Sure, I had been on picnic\u2019s\
  \ before, but on a Tuesday in Paris it was almost a whole other world. Everyone\
  \ in the park that day had the same mindset: eat, drink, and be Parisian. So, we\
  \ drank, ate to our stomach\u2019s desire, and concluded the afternoon with a nap\
  \ in the sun.  It is still the best meal I have ever had. \nI expected to find good\
  \ food in Paris, who wouldn\u2019t? What I didn\u2019t expect to find was that simplicity\
  \ surpasses extravagance. You can be eating the most expensive meal with the best\
  \ quality ingredients, but is that truly what defines a good meal? I had to re-evaluate\
  \ my prior thinking. A picnic is a simple thing and not something I had anticipated\
  \ doing in France, it wasn\u2019t on a checklist and happened organically. Witnessing\
  \ the amount of sheer bliss people had engaging in simplicity was something unexpected\
  \ and has had a lasting impact on my understanding of what it means to enjoy food\
  \ and life."
