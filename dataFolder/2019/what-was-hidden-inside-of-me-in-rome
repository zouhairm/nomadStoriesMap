Text: "When I opened my eyes, I was there, on the top of the Palatine, observing what\
  \ was left of the greatest empire that ever existed and defined the course of humanity.\n\
  For a few moments I felt that my eyes would not be able to capture all the greatness\
  \ of the little valley, embedded between the hills of the Palatine and the Capitol.\n\
  The ancient Rome's vision is impressive and anticipates the splendor of a civilization.\n\
  How my senses could be faithful to such enchantment towards in all the history being\
  \ there for centuries?\nIt would be a life-changing experience and I was prepared\
  \ for it.\nI have been alone for this journey, after all, so many shadows and details\
  \ engraved on each stone, make the walk unique and special, shape our senses and\
  \ transform us entirely.\nWhile history is relived, the memory is filled with sounds,\
  \ scents and images. Each step is an encounter with the past and its capacity of\
  \ keeping us alive.\nI was there, at the center of ancient Rome. I tasted the sensation\
  \ experienced by generals as I entered the Via Sacra and triumphantly passed through\
  \ the \"Arch of Titus\". I was completely flooded with a strong and inexplicable\
  \ feeling, I felt the weight of thousands of years of conquest and at that moment,\
  \ I abandoned the contemporary world.\nI walked so slowly that I couldn't tell how\
  \ long it took me to appreciate and snapping pictures everywhere, from the most\
  \ different angles, so that somehow the capture image would be able to eternalize\
  \ the moment inside me. I imagined how astonished a traveler would be when walked\
  \ into the Roman Forum and caught a glimpse of such greatness and perfection.\n\
  In front of temples, arches and basilicas, the impressions gathered by my senses,\
  \ nourished and enlivened my soul. A set of clear emotions were enough to show that\
  \ there are places where we can find our essence and modify our way. Each trip is\
  \ an adventure and a learning experience, we receive the stimulus that we are prepared\
  \ to understand that moment. And it was precisely what I experienced during the\
  \ quiet hours that elapsed until sunset.\nWith no rush, I strolled through the ruins\
  \ and observed the magnitude of the \"Temple of Saturn\", listening to a cheerful\
  \ tour guide who was telling to a group of students about Romulus and Remus and\
  \ founding of Rome. Instantly, I remembered my book, so piled and read, with worn\
  \ illustrations, but that was essential to give wings to my imagination for years,\
  \ and to transport me to where I was now. A certain melancholy came over me.\nI\
  \ continued my walk and imagined how life was pulsing in the city. I watched the\
  \ crowd going to the temples in search of the gods' aids, I heard the enthusiastic\
  \ senators voices and tasted the bread of grains and the Gaul's wine that fed the\
  \ soldiers.\nHow much life there was in ancient Rome!\nSuddenly, strength and invincibility\
  \ become fragility and delicacy. I felt a sweet warming aroma like nectar, and it\
  \ remained in me like a balm. I contemplated with admiration what remained of the\
  \ \"Temple of Vesta\" and thought about the choices enforced on the local women.\
  \ Women so sprecial but who were denied of their right to possess their own lives,\
  \ in the name of the beautiful and sad dutty of keeping the fire burning within\
  \ the temple. Despite of all this, the place's atmosphere is light and fresh. Flowers\
  \ adorn subtly the busts that decorate the garden. Sitting on a bench, I reflected\
  \ on the destinations traced in my childhood. I have the feeling of hearing the\
  \ most beautiful voices, singing melodious songs. Wrapped in this dream scenario,\
  \ I think happily how incredible the walk was and that although I did not expect\
  \ to find it, I found the peace that was hidden inside me. \nWhen I realized it,\
  \ the brightness was no longer so intense, and the tourist were rushing out. I came\
  \ across one of staff members saying: \"La visita \xE8 finita\". I smiled at him\
  \ and asked:\n\"Can you take a picture of me?\""
