Text: "It is not so easy to be a girl from Post-Soviet Union country, though I do\
  \ not want to follow historical discourse. This story is not about a country I am\
  \ from, but about me.\nO.K. Let\u2019s concentrate on essential, and essential is\
  \ that a girl from post-Soviet Union country has decided to explore Europe. \nAs\
  \ soon as the airplane touched the land, I found myself standing in the passport\
  \ control line and waiting for my turn in many terms. The room looked small, grey\
  \ and not as special as I expected it to be, but I still felt some special kind\
  \ of relaxation, wondering, what those butterflies were in my stomach.  The border\
  \ policeman welcomed me with a broad smile and that was it. I was in Europe \u2013\
  \ legally, and free. \nHello Berlin!\nI changed and changed stations and lines,\
  \ then buses, then a tram and eventually I was in a small town near Berlin, Frankfurt,\
  \ not that one am Main, but Frankfurt am Oder, where my host friend lived. Yahoo!\
  \ Europe! I liked it so wholeheartedly, it was so amazing, with colorful houses\
  \ like mushrooms on the both sides of the main roads. And I felt I was taking a\
  \ real European walk, when in the evening, for the first time, I walked along the\
  \ river Oder. Breathing fresh European air. I felt exactly like tourist would feel\
  \ from Post-Soviet Union country in Europe. It was all my pleasure. And suddenly\
  \ I felt how unexpected sense of gratitude was born inside of me from nowhere.\n\
  One evening, when I was sitting in the entrance of a small forest (or to be honest,\
  \ I am not really sure, whether it was small or big, but in this way it sounds cooler),\
  \ a young man appeared all of a sudden. I thought to myself no real Euro-trip happens\
  \ without a real vocation flirt - just like a gift from heaven (here I have to mention\
  \ that god did not exist in Soviet Union, in the Post-SU he exists, but it is complicated).\
  \ The young man with a friendly smile approached me (like only Europeans can do)\
  \ and said hello. We exchanged few nice phrases and when he suggested to walk down\
  \ the town in order to tell me some interesting stuff about the city, I happily\
  \ agreed. \nIt was starting getting darker. Who knew, maybe we were going to make\
  \ love? (Let me underline, that sex did not exist in the Post-SU as well)\nMeanwhile\
  \ I liked those red-bricked buildings and was told that it was inherited from Adolf\
  \ Hitler (the greatest enemy of the USSR, by the way). I even was impressed of the\
  \ terrible things from the past. Of course I was, as it was Europe. \nWe came up\
  \ to the bridge and the moment we crossed it, he told me we were in Poland (oh,\
  \ God. Post-SU again, I need Europe, some more Europe please!). I insisted we return\
  \ back. We did. I was pleased. Then he told me, that this territory of Germany was\
  \ occupied by the Soviet Union (Do you think I did not know that? Of course I did,\
  \ but we never use term \u201CPost-Soviet Union Europe\u201D, we, I mean in my country.)\
  \ And I interrupted him. I was fed up with USSR stories, if it\u2019s a \u201Cmust\u201D\
  \ to talk, then let\u2019s talk about current times, about highly developed Europe,\
  \ about its economics, industry etc. but please, not about that past. And we talked,\
  \ and I felt peaceful again. \nIt was midnight. We went to have some drinks, then\
  \ to have sex, that forbidden thing in the past. I even screamed for several times\
  \ \u201COh, God\u201D. Existing one for sure. I made love in a real European way.\
  \ Yeah, I am sure they make love, even for one night. It is Europe.\nNext morning,\
  \ the moment I opened my eyes, I heard the words, which sounded so fucking familiar\
  \ to me. But how? I was at his home... Oh, holly shit, wait\u2026 Why words on my\
  \ native language?! \nGod!\nYes, you, the one who exists! \nHow could it be?! Did\
  \ Post-Soviet Union tourist girl met a Post-Soviet Union student boy?\nEUROPE?!"
