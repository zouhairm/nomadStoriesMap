Text: "I only went because my grandfather died.\n\nThe plan had been Europe \u2014\
  \ horseback riding in the Spanish countryside, savouring custard tarts in Lisbon,\
  \ and castle hopping in Bavaria. I was in Seville, coming out of a flamenco show,\
  \ when I received the news. My mother was already on a plane home.\n\nSince we\u2019\
  d immigrated to Toronto thirteen years ago, I\u2019d only returned to Vietnam sparingly.\
  \ The last time had been in June, when I spent three days in my hometown of Hanoi.\
  \ When we said goodbye, my grandfather had tears in his eyes.\n\nI pieced the story\
  \ together while booking my flight. It had been a sudden heart failure, ten minutes\
  \ of gasping for breath \u2013 and then he was gone. I came back to my family to\
  \ grieve. In the dimming afternoon light, I took walks with my grandmother and sat\
  \ with her by the koi pond. Every morning and night, I burned incense on my grandfather\u2019\
  s altar. I watched the sky try desperately to be blue.\n\nThe days dragged as the\
  \ house mourned, and when routine began to find its feet, I stood in a half-forgotten\
  \ home with a month abruptly devoid of plans. Headed to the Mekong delta on a weeklong\
  \ business trip, my aunt offered me the chance to tag along. I agreed, and we left\
  \ on a Monday morning before dawn.\n\nWe were waiting in the lobby of a hotel in\
  \ C\u1EA7n Th\u01A1 when the tour agency called to say that every trip I\u2019d\
  \ booked for the week was cancelled. It was low season, not enough travellers; they\
  \ apologized. I sat toying with the idea of making my way around alone, but certain\
  \ points would be impossible to reach by bus, and the hastiness of the trip meant\
  \ that I was wholly unprepared.\n\n\u201CI\u2019ll take a day off,\u201D my aunt\
  \ said finally. \u201CWe can hire a car to see the neighbouring provinces. It would\
  \ be a waste to miss.\u201D\n\nThus, in the pitch black of five in the morning on\
  \ Thursday, in the smelly streets along the Pacific coast, our car picked us up\
  \ for our day trip south.\n\nMy reluctance dissipated when I saw the sun rise over\
  \ a foggy plain on a lonely road in H\u1EADu Giang. We stopped the car to stare\
  \ at the light clinging to the grass, the red, gold, and green of the field. Contrary\
  \ to the tour itinerary, our driver suggested we drive straight to C\xE0 Mau in\
  \ the morning to see the main attractions first \u2013 the mangrove forests, the\
  \ speedboat tour, the southernmost tip of the country \u2013 and return for the\
  \ lesser-known sights along the way back. \n\t\nThat was why we didn\u2019t arrive\
  \ at the wind farm until sunset. Having done no research prior to coming, I had\
  \ only heard of it from my aunt, who worked in environmental protection. She insisted\
  \ it was not to be missed, despite not being the top attraction in B\u1EA1c Li\xEA\
  u Province. With 62 turbines at 80m high, the slender white windmills spanned far\
  \ offshore in the clear gray sea. I stepped onto the dock, and the sky opened up\
  \ before me \u2013 a perfect blue with ballooning white clouds. The breeze spun\
  \ the vanes lazily, and we were alone.\n\nThe sun was as gold as when it had risen\
  \ that morning, spilling over the marsh where newts squirmed in the mud. We watched\
  \ as it burned red and began to sink. The clouds darkened, and the sky turned lavender\
  \ and pink. Reflected in the ocean, the windmills stood tall amidst a watercolour\
  \ painting.\n\nI\u2019d come home to my family to grieve, and I expected to find\
  \ nothing beyond \u2013 yet here was a scene to bring kings to their knees. I stood\
  \ in awe watching the tinges of light stream across the landscape and marvelled\
  \ at the plans that had to go wrong, the sorrow that had to be shared, and the coincidences\
  \ that had to line up to bring me there and then.\n\nWith his six grandchildren\
  \ in six different cities abroad, my grandfather had always wanted us to see the\
  \ beauty of our roots and our home. That night, I stood and stared at the sun \u2013\
  \ and then it was gone."
