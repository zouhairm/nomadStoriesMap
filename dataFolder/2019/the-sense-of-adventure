Text: "What does the unknown mean? This is perhaps the first element of change.\n\
  Our life is always an unknown road, high adventure beckons down this road. And only\
  \ dreamers, people who feel that they can change the world can make a first leap\
  \ into the unknown. Are you a dreamer like me? If yes, this story is for you.\n\
  Since antiquity mankind has no fear of the unknown. Primitive men were savages with\
  \ clubs and stones but they achieved more, they opened doors into a new life. Before\
  \ primitive man invented weapons they had hunted together with bare hands. Through\
  \ suffering and death people came to realize the necessity of establishing reliable\
  \ weapons to ensure their safety.  That\u2019s how bows and arrows appeared. Thanks\
  \ to primitive man we can trust our gut feelings and move forward. It\u2019s a good\
  \ example when, known is a result of the unknown. \n\xABBreathe again, please\xBB\
  , precisely with these words I realized it was happiness. I got the chance to go\
  \ abroad and prove myself as a good student. My choice was Poland, a country with\
  \ big opportunities and possibilities, as a little girl I was happy, dreaming about\
  \ treasures tucked inside the polish libraries and I was ready to act.\nUpon arrival\
  \ to Wroclaw I understood that my great adventure had begun. The first thing that\
  \ struck me, and I want to emphasize this is that people are very generous, ready\
  \ to help at any minute. Despite the fact that I was abroad I felt myself at home,\
  \ it was a very warm and friendly atmosphere. It was a different place and I did\
  \ not take notice of language, my habitat and other different things. The second\
  \ thing was the architecture. I was so struck with the cities beauty that I started\
  \ to explore the city. I noticed that the majority of buildings were built in gothic\
  \ style but it managed to retrofit modern style and history. Having walked for some\
  \ time, I came to Elzbieta\u2019s Church. This Church is a must-see in Wroclaw.\
  \ The building boasts impressive Gothic Architecture, now it is of roman catholic\
  \ faith and a basilica. There is a peaceful environment inside the building, it\u2019\
  s a place for spending some time alone with God, also people come up here all the\
  \ time to watch the sunset. You can climb the spiral stairway to \u201Cheaven\u201D\
  \ to see a beautiful view of the city. Nearby there are 2 towers which are connected\
  \ by text:  \u201CDeath is the gate of Life\u201D. After everything I had seen I\
  \ began to think about life. Maybe there\u2019s some validity to what people are\
  \ saying. But as it is also said, the development of history is cyclical and our\
  \ life too. \nSo my history continued, sitting one day at a classroom desk in a\
  \ polish university I thought about where I was and it was a first time I encountered\
  \ problems. There were language, not knowing the laws also I faced this contradiction\
  \ in myself. \u201CIt\u2019s time to surrender\u201D \u2013 said my head, but my\
  \ heart relentlessly repeated: \u201CYou should be unstinting in your efforts\u201D\
  . So I risked, learning is always hard, I remembered this funny time: sleepless\
  \ night with a cup of green tea, 20 books spread throughout room and me, sitting\
  \ and crying. But I will say one thing it was worth it, I think I became more confident,\
  \ I met reliable friends with whom I travelled and it opened new horizons and improved\
  \ my language skills.   I want to say that my move to Poland was my big adventure\
  \ which is still continuing. And I hope to make thousands of leaps into the unknown.\
  \ \nDear reader, I want to wish you be yourself, stay foolish stay hungry and not\
  \ afraid to make a first leap into the unknown as I did."
