Text: "Manaus\n         I look at the seat next to me and thank again for it is empty,\
  \ in the loudspeakers the pilot warns the crew that we were  about to land. Even\
  \ tired I take a look at the view through the window: an island of light in the\
  \ middle of the night in the woods. \n         I'm welcomed by the humidity that\
  \ soaks the clothes of a local taxi driver. \"Good  night\" the old man says with\
  \ an Indian appearance, then quickly get my suitcases. At least taxi drivers never\
  \ change. I tell him the address and we start to run through the city. He offers\
  \ me a cigarette and says I can smoke if I want to, gentle as he is, even offers\
  \ me a small fish shaped ashtray. I thank the offer and ask him where I could eat\
  \ at that time, he opens a smile and hands me a handful of differents flyers. The\
  \ race ends and he gives me a card with his name, I thank him for the race and the\
  \ flyers without even noticing his name, then I enter the hotel.\n        At the\
  \ reception I ask for some suggestion of where to eat at that time. The receptionist\
  \ indicates a place a few meters away, I give up on the idea and go to sleep with\
  \ the clothes of my body. \n        In the morning the sun makes itself present\
  \ in the uncovered curtains. I shower and show some normality before going to eat\
  \ breakfast. I whisper a good morning to the nothing and start looking for coffee.\
  \ The porcelain cups, the old wooden tables, and the old-fashioned retros were the\
  \ synthesis of a decaying place. At the table beside me, a group settle their shopping\
  \ tactics. I enjoy a cold tapioca and some pastries, there was no butter or cheese,\
  \ at least not cow\u2019s, a plaque said \"buffalo cheese\" in a terrible letter.\
  \ I chose not to try it, for the day would be long and the risk was enormous. \n\
  In contrast to the decadence, the hotel was decently located, as I stepped out into\
  \ the street I soon realized that it was one of the city's cavas, the shouting,\
  \ the peddlers, the countless cats on each pole (including the hotel's) all the\
  \ mess was even comforting.\n        I look for signs that (in poorly written English)\
  \ point to the Theater and the region of Largo S\xE3o Sebasti\xE3o. I bump into\
  \ dozens of people on my way because of the narrow sidewalks. The stores called\
  \ attention for the disharmony, the cheeky amazonense style in the constructions\
  \ of the Empire.\n        The bell of the Church didn't ring, the sun did not get\
  \ tired and even Mercury sweated under the scorching sun at the top of the Monument\
  \ to the Opening of the Ports, the boats seemed to want to set sail for fresher\
  \ waters, the theater shone its multicolored dome. I ask a gentleman, who had just\
  \ left the Church, for a cheap place to have lunch. He answers me with a Spanish\
  \ accent pointing to a place in the back of the theater. \"Gracias\", I say, taking\
  \ a tiny smile from him. \n        At the counter the attendant asks me what I want\
  \ for lunch, I decide and soon I receive a bowl of fish soup. I pay and whisper\
  \ a \"thank you\", leaving the place.\n        I march towards the river. Mercury\
  \ distances itself, vultures swirl up fish piles and  boats dock with their colorful\
  \ hulls and nets stretched on the deck. A little smiling girl crosses my path, her\
  \ short hair swinging in worn clothes, her eyes fixed on her path, she runs away\
  \ from everyone, treacherous in improvised ports, bare feet dancing side by side\
  \ with exposed nails, she enters a small boat that looks ready to setsail. I say\
  \ goodbye to the her as she steps away, cutting off the black water. I find the\
  \ card and then I call the taxi driver, who I assume his name is Jos\xE9. I wait\
  \ while little girls pass in front of me and boats set sail. I enter the cab and\
  \ before anything else I say: \nJos\xE9, does it always rain like that?"
