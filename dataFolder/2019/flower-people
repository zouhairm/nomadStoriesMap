Text: "They say Guilin\u2019s scenery is the best under heaven but the day I arrived,\
  \ the sky was flat and grey. I entered the language school tucked away in a dusty\
  \ alley, behind a heavy steel door the same colour as the sky. I didn\u2019t expect\
  \ much from this trip and many of my relatives expressed scepticism when I told\
  \ them of my plan for these next few weeks. \n\nThey asked doubtfully, \u201CHow\
  \ much Mandarin can you learn in three weeks?\u201D  Plenty, as it turned out. I\
  \ spent hours with my tutors, unravelling Chinese menus and learning the vocabulary\
  \ for fruits and vegetables that featured in both Western and Chinese dishes. It\
  \ turned out food was my main interest and a subject of passion for my teachers,\
  \ who gave me recommendations and recipes. \n\nWith food came friends. I started\
  \ going out for dinner with a group of women around my age, who were also studying\
  \ Mandarin at the same language school. We ate dumplings swimming in a clear broth\
  \ and served with an oily chilli sauce that dripped on the plastic tablecloth. We\
  \ dunked slices of meat and raw vegetables in a steamboat unlike anything I had\
  \ ever tried in Australia, where I grew up surrounded by Chinese restaurants. We\
  \ drank imported beer at tiny bars that mainly served Westerners and the occasional\
  \ locals who drank very quickly and became increasingly loud with each bottle consumed.\
  \ \n\nI didn\u2019t expect to find friends with such similar but different backgrounds\
  \ to mine. Like me, they had grown up outside of China but had Chinese heritage.\
  \ We shared the different terms that people used to describe us. ABC. Australian-born\
  \ Chinese. Banana was Harriet\u2019s contribution: yellow on the outside, white\
  \ inside. She was born in China, adopted by American parents and now worked for\
  \ NASA, which to me seemed as all-American as one could get. And then there was\
  \ Zoe, who was born in Malaysia to Chinese immigrants and went to university in\
  \ the UK. She was startlingly pretty, with a small silver nose ring that attracted\
  \ second glances whenever she spoke to any of the locals. And finally there was\
  \ Lily. Like Harriet, she was adopted from China but grew up in Sweden and spoke\
  \ with a lilting accent that puzzled some people when they tried to work out where\
  \ she was from. The four of us formed a tight-knit group very quickly, the kind\
  \ of close connection that usually develops between strangers in a foreign country\
  \ when one\u2019s usual network is thousands of kilometres away. We bonded over\
  \ trips to Guilin\u2019s night markets, gnawing on sizzling skewers of lamb over\
  \ grills that warmed our skin in the cool air. \n\nI put my language skills to good\
  \ use by scrutinising menus for local favourites like 'biang biang' noodles. Thick,\
  \ hand-pulled noodles that were topped with juicy beef and diced potatoes became\
  \ instant favourites. I would describe the meals I had the night before to my teachers,\
  \ using the vocabulary I had only learned days previously as they questioned me\
  \ on the ingredients used and the methods of cooking. \n\nOn my last day in Guilin,\
  \ I reflected back on the words I learned over the past three weeks. Steamed, boiled,\
  \ banana, chicken, fried. All useful vocabulary. But perhaps the most useful lesson\
  \ occurred on my first day of class, when my teacher asked if I was a flower person.\n\
  \nA what? I asked. I quite liked peonies but would not consider myself a flower\
  \ enthusiast by any means. \nA 'hua ren', she repeated. It turned out 'hua ren'\
  \ has another meaning when written using different characters. It means a foreign\
  \ citizen of Chinese origin, a simple term encompassing a complicated and sometimes\
  \ fraught concept. China doesn\u2019t allow for dual citizenship and part of me\
  \ had always considered myself fake-Chinese, since I didn\u2019t carry the requisite\
  \ passport or speak the language fluently. But it turned out the mother language\
  \ had a term for people like me. Flower people."
