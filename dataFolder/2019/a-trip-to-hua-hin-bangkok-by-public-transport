Text: 'Bangkok is one the best city to shop and the rich culture has been linger in
  our days since that. On last December 2017, I and Finna, my travel companion best
  friend were travelling to Bangkok for early celebration in Bangkok, and we include
  Hua Hin one day trip as part of our itinerary trip list. We headed to Hua Hin by
  bus, and its so difficult to find out which number of bus that actually goes there,
  as local Thailand don''t speak English fluently and even though we showed them the
  picture of Hua Hin Santorini Park, they still don''t get what we mean, as my friend,
  Finna didn''t lose hope, she kept on asking locals around, and finally we find one
  local who was able to speak slightly English, and we managed to get the correct
  bus. We stopped by one terminal which was all vans gathered together. Inside the
  Vans there were a couple, the woman was local Thailand people and the other one
  was from US, as we difficult to communicate with the driver to told him that we
  heading to Santorini Park Hua Hin, the woman suddenly helping us to speak to the
  driver and explained to him that we will be back to Thailand after 5 pm and we would
  like to be fetch at the Hua Hin Santorini Park gate. We really thank her for her
  help.

  We took around 5 hours to explore Santorini Park, took alot of beautiful picture
  as the place really resemble of Santorini look, having a tea time in the cute cafe
  inside it. At the end of time, the local ticket staff help us to call and communicate
  with the different vans driver to fetch us at the front gate and dropped at one
  of nearest BTS (Thailand rapid trains ) to get back to our hotel.'
