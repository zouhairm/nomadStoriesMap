Text: "On any given city block, I can have Halal street food, a bagel and schmear,\
  \ a Margarita-fueled lunch, or a grab-and-go sandwich from that place that\u2019\
  s more convenient than good. We have it all in New York City - especially when it\
  \ comes to our food. The city\u2019s gastronomical culture is that popular cheerleader\
  \ that everyone secretly wants to be friends with, know and boast that \u201CI know\
  \ her\u201D. It satisfies our never-ending cravings for the new, the innovative,\
  \ the fun and the unique. But there\u2019s something to be said about traveling\
  \ to the geographical origins of those Instagram-worthy $36 duck-and-something-I-can\u2019\
  t-pronounce entrees. \nGrowing up in a small town in the Florida Panhandle I rarely\
  \ had the opportunity to try new and exciting things. Trips to Wal-Mart were the\
  \ pinnacle of the day, where I drank in the glossy magazines in the checkout aisle.\
  \ The faces, the places, those fancy gourmet meals I knew my mother could never\
  \ pull off, God rest her soul, fueled my ambition to see and do it all.\nI started\
  \ out just like any other twentysomething wannabe actor in New York \u2013 in restaurants.\
  \ Coat check, host, sassy waiter- you name it, I did it. After working my way through\
  \ the fine dining circuit in well-known restaurants, I became immersed in the food\
  \ and wine culture. I was bitten. I hit the books, finally achieving the title of\
  \ Sommelier at 30. The culture gave me everything I enjoyed about life \u2013 wine,\
  \ history, food, family, and travel. \nAs any other unsatisfied New Yorker \u2013\
  \ I wanted to Supersize It, I wanted extra guac, I wanted to add truffles, I wanted\
  \ dessert. I needed to have to pain au chocolat walking in the streets of Paris,\
  \ I needed Vinho Verde in the cafes of Lisbon. Drinking, eating and experiencing\
  \ the cuisines of the world has always provided a satisfying sustenance for the\
  \ soul, however, not so great from my waistline.\nI first started really traveling\
  \ at the age of 28 \u2013 relatively late by some standards, but the seed was planted\
  \ nonetheless. Paris was the first on the list, well because, Paris. I studied the\
  \ language all my life, from middle school to college. Though, when I arrived, I\
  \ must have had an American flag stuck to my forehead. As I learned, most French\
  \ speak English. I just wanted to speak in their language with them. Thankfully,\
  \ I was able to hold a basic conversation with a local while buying a coffee. I\
  \ think she was just being nice. I felt accepted. I felt worldly.\nI ate everything\
  \ French I possibly could. These croissants never tasted fresher, the Champagne\
  \ sung as it danced across my tongue, the duck was more divine, even the coffee\
  \ gave me a boost like I could save the world. When I returned to New York, I swore\
  \ this trip was just the first course of a long, drawn out four-hour dinner. Something\
  \ in me changed, I was hooked on food culture. \nSaving every penny for my excursions\
  \ proved nearly impossible in this city. Some days consisted of Ramen noodles, buttered\
  \ toast and cheap wine, knowing I\u2019d experience the best the world had offer\
  \ soon enough. Upon the death of my mother in 2016, she left me and my brothers\
  \ what little savings she had. I had always admired her courage, especially when\
  \ it came to exploring the world. She had beautiful things from Japan, Korea, France,\
  \ South America, and Italy. I came across photos of her in Florence. Her smile and\
  \ send of wonder spoke to me. Italy was next. \nStumbling upon mom-and-pop local\
  \ eateries is one of my favorite things to do. In Italy, it\u2019s almost impossible\
  \ not to find one. Every stone-paved alley, every red-and-white checkered table\
  \ cloth trattoria pulled me in like a cowboy wrangling steer. Italian hospitality\
  \ should be the 8th World Wonder. Food is just better here. You can taste the soul,\
  \ the care and the love in every tagliatelle noodle, every sauce, every shot of\
  \ Grappa. It was the band-aid over my broken heart. \nWhat is it about tasting a\
  \ country\u2019s own food and wine on their turf that make it sing like a thousand\
  \ canaries? Why is it when I have an Aperol Spritz in my local bar, it never compares\
  \ to the ones I had in Italy? There\u2019s something about immersing yourself in\
  \ the culture of one place, seeing how they go about their daily life, experience\
  \ what they experience, living as they do, that just provides a je-ne-sais-quoi,\
  \ at least for me, that is better lived than described. \nCafes in Portugal, fishing\
  \ for dinner in Belize, 5-star restaurants in San Francisco, Poutine in Canada,\
  \ to the down-home country buffets in Georgia all provided me with a different vantage\
  \ point of the world and how we are all connected by food.\nWhere to next? Not sure,\
  \ there\u2019s such a lot of world to devour."
