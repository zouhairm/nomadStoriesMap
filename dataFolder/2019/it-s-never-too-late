Text: "Leaving Orange County, California, the place I called home for forty years\
  \ was daunting, but long overdue. You see, when my Hungarian mother kept inviting\
  \ me to Miskolc, the city where she was born, I said \u201Cno.\u201D \n\n\u201C\
  Who travels with their Moms?\u201D, I pondered but many times since then I regretted\
  \ that decision. \n\nMy Mother has long passed but lived until age 90, and I found\
  \ myself aging as well and had deep regrets for not exploring more of the world\
  \ outside my United States. \n\nIn 2016 I was given the chance to speak overseas\
  \ in Amsterdam, Czech Republic and Poland. Just me and my backpack for 19 days changed\
  \ my world. Scary as hell, intimidating to anyone who speaks just English, I knew\
  \ I had less time to seek adventure than had I started decades earlier. You see,\
  \ at age 64, time takes its toll and the idea of hiking and backpacking and sleeping\
  \ in less than ideal conditions becomes more fearful.\n\nYet, I did it.\n\nSix weeks\
  \ in Spain and Portugal with my girlfriend during the summer of 2018 and the question\
  \ of \u201CCan we do this?\u201D came up daily. We talked about not just visiting,\
  \ but moving. From a 50/50 likelihood when we started, to 92.7 percent at the end,\
  \ we returned home to purge our lives. \n\nBooks, pictures, furniture, cars; all\
  \ jettisoned to take off into the Wild Blue. From the chaos of selling everything\
  \ we owned, packing up two 28-inch suitcases and leaving for Europe, and finally\
  \ arriving in Valencia Spain, reality takes hold. \u201CCan we do this?\u201D is\
  \ still a daily conversation as we find it challenging to navigate the language\
  \ barrier, plus mass transit, which, to a Californian that lives in a car most of\
  \ the time, is a different world.\n\nWhat would motivate someone my age to undertake\
  \ a worldwide adventure with no termination date?\n\nI\u2019m driven by Millennials!\
  \ \n\nThe number of Generation Y\u2019s is estimated at about 75 million, now bigger\
  \ than the Boomer generation, which for decades set the benchmark of political,\
  \ social, and economic upheaval. \n\nThe Millennials, about age 22 to age 38 right\
  \ now, have their own strengths and weaknesses but one thing they do really well\
  \ is travel! Technology came along at the right time and the Millennial Generation\
  \ is the most traveled in history. \n\nThe best travel invention ever created? The\
  \ Smart Phone, and when you have AirBNBs, Uber, Couchsurfing, Travel Pirate and\
  \ a host of other travel friendly sites at your fingertips, it makes the process\
  \ easier. It\u2019s not a matter of whether they go or not, just a matter of WHERE\
  \ they go!\n\nI admired the heck out of them, and they inspired me. \n\nCurrently\
  \ I am on a worldwide journey, visa free, and staying in places for about six weeks\
  \ at a time.  First stop, Valencia Spain, followed by Tivoli Italy, then, forced\
  \ to leave the European region due to visa restrictions, off to Croatia and Great\
  \ Britain.\n\nI stay at AirBNBs, use Uber and Travel Advisor and Google Maps and\
  \ try to emulate the Millennials. But my primary goal is to motivate other Boomers!\n\
  \nThose born between 1946 and 1964 can get mired in their ways and not realize that\
  \ there are better ways to do things than what they believed. Many think that they\
  \ are \u201Ctoo old\u201D and that traveling is \u201Ctoo expensive\u201D or \u201C\
  too this or too that.\u201D\n\nJust a few years (or decades ago) travel was expensive\
  \ and usually required a professional guide. That was before WOW and Norwegian and\
  \ Ryan Air made air travel so affordable, and the restrictions to Marriott, Sheraton\
  \ and other more expensive lodgings was the norm.  \n\nAside from undertaking my\
  \ journey for my own fun, the plan is to motivate other Silver Surfers to get out\
  \ of their own way and realize that they CAN travel cheaply, with more fun, less\
  \ stress and more adventure.\n\nWould you care to join me?"
