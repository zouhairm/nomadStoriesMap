Text: "A quiet blue blanket spreads around us with a lively green tiny islets here\
  \ and there. After spending the day in a bat cave nearby, we are heading back to\
  \ a main island. We wearily paddle our cayuco ahead, following our guide\u2019s\
  \ directions. Little boat glides fast and light, breaking up a water surface. There\u2019\
  s no one around, no sight of tourists or local boats, and nothing is disturbing\
  \ the silence beside the gentle  splashing of oars in a water. We are lazily rowing\
  \ towards Bocas del Toro where we\u2019re staying for a couple of days. Quite exhausted\
  \ after hours of walking through a jungles to a bat cave, covered in mud but feeling\
  \ happy and accomplished, me and my friend are enjoying piece and quiet in the afternoon\
  \ sun. We use this the time to discuss our plans for the next few days as we\u2019\
  re leaving a slow island life behind and are heading into the main land. There\u2019\
  s plenty to see in a small country of Panama and I still feel the happy excitement\
  \ that usually gets me in a beginning of a journey. We only have been here a couple\
  \ of days, flying into Panama city and traveling to Isla de los Bastimientos. After\
  \ leaving here we are to move west into the main land, and stay in a small town\
  \ of Boquete which gives a great opportunity to climb the Volcano Baru and do some\
  \ jungle trekking. It won\u2019t be long till we make our way down to Panama city\
  \ to catch a plane back to Canada.\n\nSuddenly we seem to slowdown. The guide had\
  \ put the oar down and is pointing somewhere to the right of us: \u201C\xA1Mira!\u201D\
  . We see it right away and freeze - dolphins! \nThat is the last thing we expected\
  \ to see even though the area is not an unusual place for bottlenose dolphins. People\
  \ come here specifically to observe them in a wild. In fact, Bocastorito (Dolphins\
  \ bay) is just around the corner and is a base for dolphin-watching. It is a home\
  \ for about a hundred of residents, permanently living here to bring up their calves\
  \ and feed. We haven\u2019t planned of including such an activity in our agenda\
  \ and the more surprised we are to catch a glimpse of them now.\nTwo dolphins are\
  \ jumping in and out of the water not more than thirty meters from us. Their silvery\
  \ backs sprinkle in the sun as they make their synchronized jumps, just like a duet\
  \ of a synchronized swimmers. Their movements look so graceful and effortless, giving\
  \ an impression of a dance. Later they switch it up and now it looks like they are\
  \ playing, curling their backs midair. You can\u2019t help but feel jealous of how\
  \ free and joyful they seem, hopping and chasing each other. No pictures are taken\
  \ and no comments are made - we just watch, holding our breaths, as afraid to scare\
  \ them off. The encounter lasts only a couple of minutes as the pair is somersaulting\
  \ away towards the open waters. We watch them finally disappear and realize it will\
  \ be one of the highlights of our trip. Something to remember and tell a story about.\n\
  As they\u2019re completely gone we all look at each other and nod - we have to continue.\
  \ Slowly we take the oars and get ready to row.\n\u201CWhat a perfect way to end\
  \ the day\u201D my friend says, and we can\u2019t stop smiling."
