Text: "I hadn\u2019t noticed the clouds until now, at the base of the mountain pass.\
  \ An angry mass of grey pressing in behind us. In front of us, a towering stone\
  \ slope. The valley holds its breath. We\u2019re too far from our last campsite\
  \ to turn back, so we push onwards, which means upwards. \n\nMy ex-boyfriend and\
  \ I had decided to reunite and re-evaluate. We\u2019d been broken up for a year\
  \ and were living thousands of kilometres apart, but I missed him. Our lives had\
  \ been shared for seven years, and the break-up had left me feeling hesitant, small,\
  \ and lonely. I craved connection. Maybe I could find it again? I decided there\
  \ was only one way to find out: a hike. \n\nI chose the most remote place we could\
  \ get to by car \u2014 Tombstone Territorial Park, a rumpled terrain of jagged peaks\
  \ and scrubby valleys in the far northwest corner of Canada. Our reunion began driving\
  \ along a bumpy gravel road through a land of transition: Arctic Circle meets Northern\
  \ Temperate Zone, boreal meets tundra, trees give up and give way to rock and wind.\
  \ Tombstone got its name for a mountain that resembles exactly what you think. We\
  \ joked tentatively that this was a bad omen. \n\nThe first morning breezed by,\
  \ my hopeful gaze sweeping over the lichen encrusted ridges and snow dusted peaks.\
  \ I brushed my fingers against stone slabs leaning on each other in their fight\
  \ against gravity, and marveled at tiny Arctic Poppies sprouting impossibly from\
  \ piles of rock. I surprised myself as I sped up steep slopes and hopped nimbly\
  \ across boulder fields and creeks. We shared exclamations of awe. I felt the stirrings\
  \ of connection.\n\nBy mid-day, the land began revealing itself as one of extremes.\
  \ Quiet sunshine abruptly replaced by screaming winds. Then, back to sun. A meadow\
  \ teeming with marmots suddenly deserted. Explanation came from a golden eagle.\
  \ It swooped hungrily over the marmots\u2019 hummocks, wingspan longer than I am\
  \ tall. \n\nAt our first campsite, beside a crystalline lake, our communication\
  \ faltered. I could feel disconnect and loneliness creeping back in. Did I not know\
  \ how to connect anymore? Or was it just bed time? In this setting, I didn\u2019\
  t want either to be true. With encouragement from the midnight sun, we decided to\
  \ forgo both conversation and sleep, and jump in the lake. Its iciness was shocking.\
  \ We warmed each other with laughter as we scrambled clumsily onto the rocky shore.\
  \ A shared thermos of tea brought us together again, and my hope returned.\n\nA\
  \ day and a half later we\u2019ve reached the steepest part of the pass, and the\
  \ clouds have reached us. The storm begins. The now slick rocks shift under my feet,\
  \ pulling me backward with each step forward. A biting wind plasters my raincoat\
  \ to my skin as I bow down to the forces of nature and begin crawling my way up.\
  \ \n\nA misstep sends a large rock crashing downwards, and sets off a stressful\
  \ exchange about where we should we be positioned relative to one another. I crack\
  \ a joke to ease the tension, but my ex can\u2019t hear me over the downpour. Without\
  \ any conversation and with the rain obscuring my vision, I feel like I\u2019m hiking\
  \ alone. I now know a wilderness reunion was not the solution. As my sodden backpack\
  \ bears down on me, I start comparing myself to my married friends and wondering\
  \ what I\u2019m doing here. \n\nAnd then suddenly I see it, through the rain weeping\
  \ off my eyelashes: a flat ridge, the top of the pass. A grin spreads across my\
  \ face as I pull myself over the edge, drop my pack, and collapse on my back. Lying\
  \ there, the sound of my breath mixes with the rain, and the heartbeat in my hands\
  \ pushes against the ground. The boundaries dissolve between rocks and sky and me.\
  \ This is the strongest sense of connection I\u2019ve felt all year, and I\u2019\
  m alone."
