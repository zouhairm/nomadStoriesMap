Text: "I stepped onto the hot pavement and began to walk. I had no destination in\
  \ mind and no map guiding me. I let my feet carry me which ever way they would,\
  \ sending me down any street as easily as a stream moved fallen leaves. \nI knew\
  \ no one in this country. I was lonely as I wandered the streets of the old Habsburg\
  \ capital, but I tried to push it from my mind. I surrendered myself to the winding\
  \ streets, determined to immerse myself in the experience, here and now. I left\
  \ home where it was, thousands of kilometers away, rather than carrying it in my\
  \ head. \nSo, I followed my every whim, turning corners with no second thought.\
  \ I drank in the views of the buildings around me, each with their own elegant facades\
  \ that harkened back to the days when great powers clashed and the halls of Vienna\u2019\
  s Hofburg palace teemed with nobility, diplomats and men of war. The National Library\
  \ stood proudly nearby, housing countless medieval secrets, now open for the world\
  \ to see. The majesty of these building sawed me and I considered how these same\
  \ streets that were now captivating me had inspired both the truest forms of artistic\
  \ beauty and the darkest deeds mankind has committed. \nMy mind was swimming as\
  \ I continued to wander. It was the early afternoon and Europe\u2019s hottest heatwave\
  \ in years was just beginning. I planned on inviting anyone I met at my hostel to\
  \ have dinner with me in the evening but until then I remained at the mercy of the\
  \ current. It took me to the Stadtspark, which had soft grass that invited me down\
  \ for a rest. I sat there near a wide pond full of catfish and watched the world\
  \ around me. \nThere was a young family sitting on blanket not far from me, with\
  \ two young children yelling and running circles around their parents. An elderly\
  \ couple were strolling on the path and a group of students listened to house music,\
  \ flowing out of a small speaker. All the while the European summer grew warmer\
  \ still, and I was forced to withdraw from this little world to go buy a bottle\
  \ of water.\nI bought one from a man who pedaled a little caf\xE9 on wheels through\
  \ the city. Then my feet carried me away yet again, this time to the railing on\
  \ the edge of one of Vienna\u2019s canals, on the edge of the park. I looked over\
  \ the rail and saw the water down bellow. There was merely a small trickle of water\
  \ that trickled through the canal. It conjured up a memory of an old millhouse I\
  \ had seen only a week earlier in the Dutch countryside. There, a small stream had\
  \ powered a great millstone, that pulverized grain into flour for decades before\
  \ being forgotten and left to decay. I imagined myself as a drop within the stream,\
  \ continuously moving through life, while the wheel continued to turn and pulverize,\
  \ until eventually it too came to stand still. \nIt was then I made my first real\
  \ decision of that day, which was to walk back to my hostel to try and meet some\
  \ others that I would be sharing this experience with. As I walked through those\
  \ streets again, reversing my course, I thought of the history I was walking through.\
  \ No longer was this place the imperial stronghold, busy with administering thousands\
  \ of diverse peoples, that captivated so many before me. It was however, still an\
  \ impactful city to wander. History was not an abstract concept, found only in dusty\
  \ books and in the mundane lectures within university halls. Here, it was undeniably\
  \ alive. Flowing constantly, moving us all forward just as my feet had carried me."
