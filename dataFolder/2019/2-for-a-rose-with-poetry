Text: "The bar's television shows the Benfica match. The city is Porto, but there\
  \ are some fans of the rival in Lisbon. I'm with a friend and make mine his bet:\
  \ red should win. It's an Irish pub and makes sense to take a pint of Guinness.\
  \ The tables are all full: groups of friends, couples, families. It's Friday night\
  \ and for me life is making no sense at the moment. Sometimes things that happen\
  \ are not easy to understand. But we keep living.\nI set up a chair to sit by the\
  \ counter. I need to stay on my side to follow the soccer game. A tourist who appears\
  \ to be German offers the bank holding only his coat. Thank you, but there I had\
  \ already solved my seating problem and began to drink my  beer. After the interval,\
  \ in the first minutes of the second half of the game against the weak Arouca, a\
  \ bouquet of individually packaged flowers enters the bar. They are roses.\nThere\
  \ is also a man holding the plants. Wisdom, go first to the tables where the couples\
  \ are. No one buys. He comes to the counter and offers the sale to the friend who\
  \ accompanies me: \"How about a flower for the girl?\" My friend refuses and after\
  \ the man leaves, as a feminist, I say that if he had offered to buy myself the\
  \ flower for me, I would have done so. But he did not even look at me. Lost the\
  \ sale.\nI finish my pint and ask for another. I go to the bathroom. On the way\
  \ out, I stop at the flower man. He accompanies me to the counter, where he waits\
  \ for a thin one that the bar boy gives him. Must be known from the house. I think\
  \ the courtesy, if I were the owner, would also give beer glasses to the street\
  \ vendors.\nBehold, he does not recognize me and he offers me his product. \"Each\
  \ flower comes with a poem written by me.\" I no longer hesitate and open the wallet\
  \ to collect the \u20AC 2. A coin just in exchange for two of the best things in\
  \ this world. I begin to talk and discover that he is Mozambican but has lived in\
  \ Porto for some time. I ask how many flowers he has already sold and how many poems\
  \ he has already written, he does not know how to measure. Or maybe he does not\
  \ want to. It's Friday, after all.\nFrom my accent, he easily finds out I'm Brazilian.\
  \ His girlfriend is too. Lives in Rio de Janeiro, in Niter\xF3i. They've been together\
  \ for over a year and have never seen each other. He shows a picture from her Facebook.\
  \ Ask me to look at his poetry page. I pick up my phone and do it (short too: Flowers\
  \ and Poetry).\nI ask him how this dating works, she away from him, he away from\
  \ her. \"There's a lot of poetry,\" he says. It tells that it was through the internet\
  \ that they met and that they talk every day. \"You do not have to be around to\
  \ love. Love is in the heart, that's what we feel. \"Maybe one day they'll meet,\
  \ there's no date for that. \"She is beautiful, a wonderful person. I want to go\
  \ to Brazil, but I still have no money.\nI tell him to come, that my country is\
  \ beautiful, full of cheerful people. He says he likes the Brazilians and takes\
  \ his last drink. I choose a pink rose. Attached to that is a page - poetry comes\
  \ handwritten.\nThe man now picks up his coat and the flowers that are yet to be\
  \ sold. They were resting on the bar counter while he paused to work for the beer.\
  \ Now it's time to move on. \"You know, I believe in love,\" he says before leaving.\n\
  I look at him and smile: me too."
