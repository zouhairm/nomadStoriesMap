Text: "It was the winter of 2011. My friend and I embraced our loved ones as a farewell\
  \ to start a parallel life. Exchange students in Sweden. We had never been there\
  \ before.\n\nI got on the plane into the unknown. Friendships, connections, encounters\
  \ with wonderful people who teach us the most beautiful things in life. My Bachelor\
  \ Degree took me there, but my heart made me live great adventures. Unforgettable\
  \ months with people from other cultures and other ways of living but with the same\
  \ dreams and desires.\n\nFor five months I learned about independence, or at least\
  \ an example of what independence was. I saw myself through other people eyes, I\
  \ created a very strong bond with three other people, like my own and remote family.\
  \ We took care of ourselves, shared experiences, culinary adventures, dreams, loves,\
  \ desires and many other amazing things. Some Spanish and Mexican girls in Sweden.\
  \ And in a small place, with a predominantly cold climate, strange and difficult\
  \ language and dark days, I found peace.\n\nNew sounds, flavors, textures, aromas,\
  \ lonely streets with strange names, peaceful wind, lots of snow and amazing scenarios.\
  \ A magical village of few inhabitants with a totally different lifestyle. It was\
  \ marvelous. I remember all the falls my Mexican friend and I had through the ice\
  \ of the snow. We learned about those falls and the perfect shoes we must use to\
  \ walk but even so, from time to time, our leg got lifted in the air and in a matter\
  \ of milliseconds, our whole body flew and fell precipitously. It was part of the\
  \ experience, the pain to show us that we were alive and that we were there. We\
  \ were lucky. How many people can actually do that? How many people have the possibility\
  \ to go as an exchange student and tell a story or maybe thousands?\n\nI have always\
  \ felt like an underdog, like I don\xB4t belong anywhere, like being outside of\
  \ a hungry and noisy world. I am different, a little bit lonely, with a great sense\
  \ of humor and in the search of my own being, wanting to give more and show to myself\
  \ that I can be the person that I know I can be but I do not dare to be. This trip\
  \ was the beginning of that recognition. I'm still looking, I still want to travel\
  \ and get to know myself through other cultures, thoughts, and ways of living that\
  \ have never passed through my mind. I know that I still have a long way to go and\
  \ many things to learn. No matter how old you are and how many stages you have to\
  \ face. The important thing is to get up and get back on track, even if you have\
  \ to start from scratch. Life is a constant change, constant learning, it is not\
  \ cyclical if you don\xB4t want to. We can transform things and translate them into\
  \ the wonders of our deepest dreams.\n\nSweden was a leap into the unknown, but\
  \ there is much more to come for my personal growth. I know there will be more trips\
  \ that could teach me a little bit of who I am and a little bit of that hungry but\
  \ colorful world.\n\nRight now I'm out of my country, traveling, so I can let go\
  \ of things and old loves, find new answers, learn again from my mistakes. I need\
  \ to believe in me from the bottom of my soul and open all those doors to the unknown\
  \ without any fear or without thinking about it. Of course, I sometimes feel those\
  \ butterflies in the stomach like the ones you experience when you're in love, but\
  \ that will not stop me, I want more, I want to break other barriers, discover other\
  \ universes to fulfill my biggest and dearest dream of all, to become a writer.\
  \ I wish to release all those letters sheltered in my head and mold them so I can\
  \ create harmonies that flutter through my eyes and tremble in my fingers whispering\
  \ and, sometimes, screaming: It\u2019s time, now is your moment to shine."
