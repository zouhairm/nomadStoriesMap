Text: "The Faroese are not a flashy people and appear to be humbled by their environment.\
  \ The Faroe Islands are primarily treeless, but are covered in a lush green carpeting\
  \ of grass and are juxtaposed against perpetually cloudy skies above and milky,\
  \ slightly turquoise waters on all sides. There are sheep pastures abound.\n\nAt\
  \ a quick glance, the Faroe Islands appear to be a sleepy place, but with one meditative\
  \ glance at the sky, one would notice the clouds ripping by overhead. One glance\
  \ at the icy sea and one would observe the relentless beating of the coastline.\
  \ The land itself is static, but there is a lulling sense of danger just out of\
  \ reach. Simply by contrast, a feeling of comfort and safety is obtained by merely\
  \ opting to stay put.\n\nI sought a simple place that was easy to navigate and offered\
  \ the chance for solitude. I packed a sketchpad and some paintbrushes and chose\
  \ the Islands\u2019 second largest town of Klaksvik as my base. As I was visiting\
  \ in October, I seemed to be the only tourist in sight. Like the rest of the Faroe\
  \ Islands, Klaksvik is a fishing town and sports a few restaurants, a few pubs,\
  \ and a grocery store. \n\nI found a little boathouse to stay in that had been converted\
  \ to an Airbnb and the fjord on which it was situated provided the perfect backdrop\
  \ and soundtrack for my evenings of painting and reading. In the mornings, I cooked\
  \ breakfast and prepped my lunch for the day\u2019s hiking where I climbed through\
  \ the damp air and soggy earth with the sensation that it had just rained, though\
  \ it never did.\n\nOne evening, I decided to head out after dinner to one of the\
  \ few pubs nearby. Many of the patrons of the pub were older fishermen as evidenced\
  \ by their weather beaten skin, unkempt style, and strong hands. The conversations\
  \ were never filled with a roaring laughter, but were intelligent and enlightening\
  \ and flowed easily due to our mutual curiosities. We spoke about fishing excursions\
  \ to Greenland and the annual whale hunts. I first found myself speaking with a\
  \ crowd, but the crowd slowly dwindled down to just one, a man named Helgi. \n\n\
  Eventually, Helgi asked the inevitable question of whether or not I was married.\
  \ As a gay man in my mid-thirties, I knew better than to offer up an honest answer\
  \ in an unfamiliar culture, so I replied with the typical \u201CI-have-yet-to-meet-the-right-person\u201D\
  \ response and quickly deflected back to him with the same question. Helgi told\
  \ me that he was married once, but that his wife had left him a few years back to\
  \ move to the Greece. \n\nHelgi then told me that he often considered ending his\
  \ own life. He said that he didn\u2019t have much to live for, that his days were\
  \ the same day after day, that he sometimes stood on the bow of the ship at night\
  \ and contemplated jumping in to be swallowed by the water. He said he didn\u2019\
  t know which would be worse, the shock of the cold or the suffocation. My own breath\
  \ stopped as he told me this.\n\nAs a tourist, I found the grey simplicity of the\
  \ Faroes to be endearing, but Helgi instantly taught me that a lifetime in those\
  \ same conditions provided for a vitally different perspective. The image of an\
  \ old man standing in the moonlight on the bow of a fishing boat feeling a lure\
  \ to his death perhaps makes for a beautiful film scene, but looking into the man\u2019\
  s eyes as he told me about his pain was anything but. \n\nI found a sense of romance\
  \ in my trip to the Faroe Islands, but not the romance that is defined by the presence\
  \ of a lover, or even of a dramatic twist. The romance I found was a new lense through\
  \ which to view one\u2019s surroundings and to assign meaning to circumstance. When\
  \ I eventually left Helgi, I shook his hand and tried to smile with my eyes as I\
  \ thanked him for the conversation. I gave Helgi my address and meant it when I\
  \ told him that I hoped he would write to me."
