Text: "I elected to take the Trans-Siberian express route, but not to take the actual\
  \ seven day Trans-Siberian express train. Instead, I'd do as the locals do, and\
  \ take the platskartny (third class, open compartments) all the way across Russia,\
  \ from Moscow to Vladivostok. I planned on stopping at various cities along the\
  \ route as I had nearly two months of vacation. I also planned on using Couchsurfing\
  \ on my journey.\n\nThe first three legs of my trip- Moscow to Yekaterinburg, Yekaterinburg\
  \ to Tomsk, and Tomsk to Novasibirsk- had been uneventful.   The trips were all\
  \ under a day and I was able to pass the time easily in my shared compartments.\
  \ The next leg of my journey was from Novasibirsk to Irkutsk and was about a day\
  \ and a half. I shared a compartment with a mother and daughter. \n\nThe daughter\
  \ was very shy at first, but the mother was quite friendly. She was an English teacher\
  \ at a local school, and they were returning home from summer vacation. We chatted\
  \ about where I was from and how I liked Russia so far- all common traveler questions.\
  \ I told her I also was an English teacher in Korea and we started talking about\
  \ our classes. The daughter was in middle school and tried her English lessons with\
  \ me.\n\nAt the end of the train ride when pulling into Irkutsk, the mother and\
  \ daughter invited me to tea with them and helped me around the city for the first\
  \ day. It was great being able to share with them before parting ways. \n\nThe last\
  \ leg of my Russian train adventure was from Ulan Ude to Vladivostok. This was a\
  \ three day trip. Again, I made my way to my assigned bed and settled in. This time,\
  \ I was sharing with a family. The father, mother, and daughter were with me, and\
  \ the brother and friend were in the next compartment.\n\nWhile this family spoke\
  \ only some English (and I no Russian besides a few trite travelers phrases), the\
  \ father and mother were instantly welcoming to me. Maybe it had something to do\
  \ with my being a 24 year old girl traveling alone. These trains provided boiling\
  \ water and mugs for tea, but travelers were supposed to bring their own food. When\
  \ it was time for the first meal, the family beckoned me to join them. I came down\
  \ from my upper bunk with salami, bread, cucumbers and cheese. They offered me drinks,\
  \ soup, tomatoes, and chocolate. We ended up sharing food every meal.\n\nThey also\
  \ would invite me to play card games with them at times. I even watched a movie\
  \ with the daughter one time, though it was difficult with subtitles on a small\
  \ screen and shared headphones. \n\nOverall, this family was entirely kind and friendly\
  \ to me in a capacity I hadn't expected. I never encountered anyone I had issues\
  \ with or that was unhelpful or mean, but I also hadn't met anyone like this. I\
  \ will always remember the family from the train, and even though we parted in Vladivostok,\
  \ they are one of my favorite stories."
