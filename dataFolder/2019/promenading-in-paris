Text: "In 2017, my daily life consisted of checking dozens of emails, responding to\
  \ endless text messages, and binge watching television to relax. I was in graduate\
  \ school and working full-time. My days seemed to end as soon as they began. Life\
  \ was a constant barrage of decisions. It was overwhelming and oppressive.\n\nThe\
  \ year before, everyone in my program was applying for summer internships. Everyone,\
  \ but my one friend Sam. When I asked why, his response was \u201CI work all year\
  \ long, why would I want to spend my summer working\u201D? His plan was to hike\
  \ the Appalachian trail. I ended up working an internship that summer, but inspired\
  \ by Sam, I decided that after graduation, I would travel instead of finding a job\
  \ right away. Many people did not agree with my decision, but I stayed true to my\
  \ plan, especially after Sam found out he was sick with a rare cancer. It gave me\
  \ even more of a reason to put travel first.\n\nGraduation felt like a huge relief\
  \ and in June of 2017, I arrived at JFK airport with a backpack and a one-way ticket\
  \ to Paris. I had wanted to go to Paris since my Freshman year of high school when\
  \ I took French as my chosen language. As much as I learned over those four years,\
  \ I knew that no book could show me the true spirit of Paris.\n\nI had traveled\
  \ with a friend and our first night in Paris was her Birthday. We went out to dinner\
  \ at a local restaurant close to the Sacre Couer. A simple menu was given to us,\
  \ only five options. It felt nice to not have so many choices. Outside it began\
  \ to drizzle. People darted inside off of the cobblestone streets, but at the same\
  \ time no one seemed in a rush. Many sat drinking wine or having dessert, just enjoying\
  \ the company and the conversation. I felt no need to talk or to eat quickly. There\
  \ was nowhere I needed to be other than in this moment.\n\nWhen the rain stopped,\
  \ we strolled up toward the Sacre Couer. Instead of taking the lift, we took the\
  \ stairs. I was out of breath by the time I reached the top, a realization that\
  \ I needed to get outside and move more. The church was even more astonishing in\
  \ person than photos could ever show. Outside there was an abundance of people,\
  \ some sitting on the large stone steps in front of the church and others sitting\
  \ alongside the hill in front of the church. They were laughing, relaxing, and even\
  \ drinking. After a walk through the church, we took a seat on the on the stone\
  \ steps and spoke with a couple drinking some Corona\u2019s as the sun set over\
  \ the city.\n\nTime seemed to stand still, other than the darkening sky. We stayed\
  \ until the sun disappeared and bid our new friends adieu. The walk back to the\
  \ apartment was one filled with talks of what a peaceful and spectacular day we\
  \ had. We relished in the refreshing simplicity and slow pace we experienced in\
  \ such a large city and how we only took our phones out to take a photo of the sunset.\n\
  \nBack at the apartment, we had a new appreciation for our lack of air conditioning,\
  \ dishwashing machines, and television sets, all things we complained about when\
  \ we arrived. The rest of our time in Paris was spent meandering to the store for\
  \ bread and jam, eating crepes of all kinds when the mood suited us, seeing all\
  \ the typical sights, such as the Notre Dame and Eiffel Tower, and stumbling across\
  \ a local concert in the middle of a small street. All of these things done with\
  \ no hurriedness, no fear of being late, and no need to stop and check texts or\
  \ emails. All we had was a newfound adoration for slowing life down, an adoration\
  \ that I planned to take back home with me.\n\nAs we sat on the balcony our last\
  \ night, still feeling the heat of the day, I took a sip of my wine and in the silence,\
  \ I thought to myself, \u201CSam would love this.\u201D"
