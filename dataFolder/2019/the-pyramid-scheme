Text: "The Pyramid Scheme\n\n        I wanted to climb that pyramid. It didn\u2019\
  t matter how long it took to get there, or how many live chickens were thrown up\
  \ onto the luggage rack and brought onto the shanty-town bus we rode on for 5 hours\
  \ to get out to the middle of nowhere jungle where it sat. I was destined to see\
  \ that giant marvel feat for myself. My mother had climbed Chichen Itza in 1969,\
  \ so \u201CI must climb Chichen Itza\u201D. There was no question.\n\n\tWe took\
  \ a gypsy cab to the site, still unable to see exactly what we were getting ourselves\
  \ into. The jungle isn\u2019t very tall there, but it is thick enough that one can\u2019\
  t see too far ahead. We paid our admission in pesos, the equivalent amount of the\
  \ cost of a pack of gum in the States, and stepped through this Jurassic Park-esque\
  \ gate.\n\n\tJust like in some action adventure/ Lost City movie, there around the\
  \ bend, was the jewel of the Mayan Riviera. The Yucatan topography is very flat,\
  \ so the pyramid at Chichen Itza stands out for miles like a Sears Tower of ancient\
  \ Mexico. To physically, actually see a pyramid in real life is a surreal image,\
  \ and the four of us nomads soaked up all of the visual archaic eye candy.\n\n\t\
  In 2004, before it became officially designated as a \u201CWonder of the World\u201D\
  , rules were very relaxed at Chichen Itza. At that time, one could still physically\
  \ climb it unguarded and unsupervised. It took some hutzpah and the desire to place\
  \ your life in the hands of God and 2000-year-old engineering to want to climb the\
  \ damn thing. But I looked at scaling this triangular temple as something I had\
  \ to walk up in my mother\u2019s footsteps.\n\nMayans were smaller people, so the\
  \ 91 stairs up one side aren\u2019t the easiest to utilize and keep good traction\
  \ on. Meanwhile, the only thing saving you from imminent death is a single thick\
  \ rope, attached to a chain, bolted to the top stair of the pyramid. Tourists were\
  \ climbing up one side, grasping onto the rope for their lives, as they made their\
  \ way up and down the beast.\n\nI\u2019d made the loco decision to wear slip-on\
  \ sandals that day, and knew I\u2019d meet my maker if I tried sporting my #fail\
  \ footwear up the side of a steep pyramid. It was hotter than Satan\u2019s crotch\
  \ that day, and the anxiety, mixed with my fear of heights, began to set in. Throwing\
  \ all caution, rationale, logic, and reason to the wind, I took off my shirt and\
  \ sandals, and set them at the base of el castillo. \n\n Like the panther within\
  \ its throne room, I began to scale Mexico\u2019s pyramidal Mount Everest in an\
  \ attempt to obtain bucket list, parental footstep-walking-in greatness. Sweating\
  \ like a boar, shaking and terrified of plummeting to my death, but determined to\
  \ succeed, I climbed up the pyramid at Chichen Itza as quickly as my bare feet and\
  \ shirtless torso could scurry to the top. When I finally reached the summit, the\
  \ sweat poured off me so profusely one would think I\u2019d just completed a Sports\
  \ Illustrated Swimsuit cover photoshoot.\n\nThe only thing I hadn\u2019t planned\
  \ on was my escape route. How in the hell was I supposed to get down a pyramid without\
  \ a ski lift or helicopter? Deciding I\u2019d already left my vanity at the base,\
  \ I sat down on my toosh and began butt-scooting down the side of a pyramid. I held\
  \ onto the rope with my right hand for dear life; it was shaking and swaying to\
  \ and fro with everyone grasping onto it like a dance bar.\n\nLuckily for me, I\
  \ survived the climbing the great pyramid at Chichen Itza, much like mi madre did\
  \ back when she was young and stupid enough to have climbed it, without safety equipment,\
  \ either. The views from the top were incredible. The vista of the endless jungle\
  \ was breathtaking and the ancient energy from such a thriving culture of the classic\
  \ period was palpable. But, the real takeaway for me, was the bragging rights of\
  \ having climbed a pyramid. \n\nJust like my mama had."
