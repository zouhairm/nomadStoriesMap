Text: "In the garden of a family-owned posada near Mindo, Ecuador, I sat at sunset\
  \ encircled by bird feeders filled with sugar water. Long-tailed sylphs and slender\
  \ wood nymphs flitted, hovered, perched, and sipped nectar. The hummingbirds\u2019\
  \ furious wingbeats refracted the last sunrays into glints of emerald and bronze.\n\
  \     Wildlife abounds in Mindo\u2019s cloud forests. I had only two days to sample\
  \ them, and the first day was coming to a close. I would return to Quito for another\
  \ four weeks of work-related language study.\n     Jorge, a local nature guide,\
  \ joined me in the garden to plan the next day\u2014January 1st. He sketched a route\
  \ and asked, \u201CYou have seen Gallo de la Pena?\u201D \n     My bird book described\
  \ the iconic gallo, or Andean Cock-of-the-Rock: a foot long from crest to tail,\
  \ vermilion except for black tail feathers and wing feathers black to silvery gray.\
  \ But the gallo can go unseen in a forest canopy that performs tricks of light and\
  \ shadow in the wind.\n     \u201CNever,\u201D I told him. I hadn\u2019t dared wish\
  \ for a sighting of this grand resident on so short a trip.\n     Then Jorge shared\
  \ his secret. He knew of a lek\u2014a place where birds court\u2014the gallo\u2019\
  s lek, on a steep hillside behind a neighbor\u2019s farm. He couldn\u2019t guarantee\
  \ the gallos would come, but the pursuit enticed me. \n     Jorge left, and I walked\
  \ to my room in the posada\u2019s main house. Since early morning, the innkeepers\
  \ and staff had been preparing Nochevieja, the New Year\u2019s Eve fiesta where\
  \ families would feast and dance, making the night resound with laughter and music.\
  \ The inn\u2019s guests\u2014families from Quito and beyond\u2014were assembling\
  \ in a refurbished stable beyond the garden. But I prepared for bed, and leaden\
  \ from a day of trekking, soon fell asleep.\n     A few hours later, my alarm woke\
  \ me in the dark. I dressed and walked to the main door, where Jorge was waiting.\
  \ We acknowledged each other and headed to a well-worn Range Rover. Jorge started\
  \ the motor, and for an instant, the insects paused their clicks and chirrs. Jorge\
  \ wiped the mist from the windshield, turned on the headlights, and eased down the\
  \ road. We jostled a few miles to a tiny farmhouse, barely visible in the dark.\
  \ We quietly left the truck and crossed the yard. A woman was waiting on the porch,\
  \ and Jorge reached up to hand her some American dollars.\n     We climbed a wooded\
  \ slope where the muddy ground sucked at my boots. An occasional burst from Jorge\u2019\
  s flashlight revealed low-hanging vines or a jumble of rocks coated with slick,\
  \ black moss. We arrived at a clearing where a rough wooden bench was tucked among\
  \ bushes. I sat down where I could look between the branches and wait.\n     Gently,\
  \ the morning light began to open around us, giving shape to massive tree trunks\
  \ and rubbery leaves. Tiny creatures began to move and I felt a breath of wind.\
  \ Birdsong started. Then from the near distance, I heard a noise, something like\
  \ retching. I looked to Jorge and he nodded at the gallo\u2019s unmistakable call.\n\
  \     Soon we saw movement and lifted our binoculars to scan the ravine below. The\
  \ gagging sounds grew rhythmic and closer until at least two males were near. As\
  \ I focused through the greenery, scarlet appeared in my view.\n     One cock-of-the-rock\
  \ balanced on a branch too slender for his weight, and he swayed up and down. Behind\
  \ him, another gallo attached himself to a tree trunk. Jorge pointed to the location\
  \ of two more. I caught only moments of the birds as they moved among the leaves.\
  \ I saw a sliver of a wing, a curve of a neck, the edge of a crest. The gallos were\
  \ active, eager to claim a space and attract a mate. \n     For a fraction of an\
  \ instant one male came squarely into view, but no females came. Maybe a hawk-eagle\
  \ soared above the canopy and kept them away. Then the males were gone.\n     Jorge\
  \ apologized for them, but I was grateful for even the fractured views. Filled with\
  \ glimpses of the gallos\u2019 lives, I smiled, knowing immediately, I would have\
  \ a very rich year."
