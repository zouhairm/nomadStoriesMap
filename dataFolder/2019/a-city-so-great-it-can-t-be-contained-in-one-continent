Text: "If we travel simply to indulge ourselves we are missing some of the greatest\
  \ lessons life has to offer-unknown.\nI believe that life is about constantly growing\
  \ and learning, and personally, I feel by opening your mind to unfamiliarity you\
  \ are able to grow in ways unachievable by any other matter.\nTrying new things\
  \ may open your eyes and make you realize you found something you never knew you\
  \ liked before.\nLast winter I visited Turkey, and although I am terrified of taking\
  \ long trips alone, I decided and booked a solo trip to Istanbul, Turkey.\nAs soon\
  \ as I walked out from the Ataturk airport I fell in love with Istanbul, with its\
  \ dazzling mix of the old and the new, the West and the East, it is the constant\
  \ beating of the wave of the East against the rock of the West,so there is a reason\
  \ why it is called the    'Center of the Wold'.\nStanding tall with its cascading\
  \ domes and six minarets is the Sultan Ahmed Mosque, or as most people refer to\
  \ it as the Blue Mosque, because of the color of its interior tile. The fact that\
  \ the Blue Mosque has six minarets is very unique, as most mosques have only one\
  \ to four minaret. According to our tour guide, one of the stories was that the\
  \ Sultan directed his architect to make gold (altin) minarets, which was misunderstood\
  \ as six (alti) minarets. An interesting fact is that this is still an active place\
  \ of worship and to see the mosque with its worshippers, to hear the sounds of faith,\
  \ and to feel the spirituality makes the visit even more special.\nOn the other\
  \ side of Sultan Ahmet Park, Hagia Sophia dominates the skyline with its red walls\
  \ and minarets.\nA glorious architecture survivor in the history of Istanbul, is\
  \ a former church, mosque and now a museum with a stunning Byzantine and Islamic\
  \ architecture, nearly 1500 years in age, every wall and floor has a story to tell.\n\
  \ As you walk inside, you start to admire the beautiful and unique artwork, and\
  \ picturing the numbers of emperors and sultans who have probably stood exactly\
  \ where I was standing at the time\u2026 it\u2019s very hard not to feel insignificant.\
  \ Its mesmerising architecture definitely made me stand humbled and soak in the\
  \ intricacy and tranquility.\nThese two great architectural achievements from the\
  \ Ottoman Empire stand next to each other in Istanbul\u2019s main square as if competing\
  \ to be more impressive than the other.\nWondering down the crowded Grand Bazaar\
  \ with its colorful lanterns and its maze of hallways, you will find some of the\
  \ friendliest people in the world.\nWith four thousand shops it is worlds oldest\
  \ shopping mall, this beautiful, historic, teeming shopping district is a living\
  \ reminder of the grandness of the Ottoman Empire.\nMy trip was finished with a\
  \ visit to the Asian side of Istanbul, Anadolu Yakasi (Anatolian Side).\nSituated\
  \ in the Asian part of the city Camlica Tepesi (Camlica Hill) offers a panoramic\
  \ view of Istanbul, which includes both shores of the Bosphorus and the two bridges\
  \ that connect Asia with Europe.\nThe most beautiful sunsets in the entire city\
  \ can be viewed from this hill, and I got a feeling that only from \xC7aml\u0131\
  ca Hill will you realize the true size and force of this 15 million city.\nIstanbul\
  \ carries with it a fascinating blend of secular and religious elements: it is a\
  \ modern city evolving, for sure, but you still do not get the sense that it will\
  \ ever quite leave behind its ancient and historical feel.\nThis trip turned out\
  \ to be one of the best experiences of my life, and if I had not stepped out of\
  \ my comfort zone, I would have never discovered it.\nIn conclusion, immersing oneself\
  \ in a new place can be a culture shock at first, but it forces one out of their\
  \ comfort zone opening the doors for growth.\nCulture and language are some of the\
  \ most challenging and enriching experiences available to people, and through travel,\
  \ one can learn about an unfamiliar culture, and beliefs, which compels us to see\
  \ past our tunneled vision of perception."
