Text: "It was with child-like excitement I hopped out of bed. It is very early. The\
  \ damp thin slither of foam on the floor of a small tent is no match for my high\
  \ spirits. Try as it might to dampen them- today was my day. \n\nI bounded out and\
  \ saw Oliver, king of the campground, seated utop his car seat throne. He was surrounded\
  \ by various treasures collected from the dump. His latest purchases included a\
  \ telescope and tripod, an accordion and a croquet set, which still lay strewn around\
  \ our small tent settlement. Oliver looked tired.\n\nSuddenly I hear a rustling\
  \ noise from Fred\u2019s van. His disheveled head pokes up and with half open eyes\
  \ he peers out the window, moustache bristling. \n\nThese two are going to need\
  \ a coffee to get going.\n\nI wait patiently as they sip their coffees because I\
  \ am a good friend and understand most people these days are \u2018useless without\
  \ coffee\u2019. It is a sad fact and a bad habit but today is not the day to start\
  \ a coffee rehabilitation program, I think to myself. Then I think about what lies\
  \ in store for us on this seemingly innocuous morning.\n\nIt is my turn to drive\
  \ and I make a small effort to tidy my naff car because part of being a good friend\
  \ is to be courteous.\n\nMy car is one of those ugly mini bus type-things. Practical,\
  \ yes, but by no stretch of the imagination is it stylish. When I asked the guy\
  \ at the used car lot if he would ever be seen driving it he exclaimed \u201CHell\
  \ no!\u201D\n\nThis did nothing for my ego as I pootled out of there. But now was\
  \ different. Now there was no time for ego. My veins were filled with the excitable\
  \ anticipation familiar to those first date jitters. The stars had aligned and the\
  \ forecast was perfect. We were going to get some waves. Some very good waves.\n\
  \nOr we would if Fred could decide what board to bring. I tell him bring both and\
  \ get in the car now please. Finally we are off. It is only a short drive to the\
  \ points, probably about 2 songs worth and I have selected 2 bangers to accompany\
  \ us on this happy morning.\n\nI glimpse Fred in my rear-view mirror. He looks miles\
  \ away in the back of my big car. His hair and moustache are being gently tousled\
  \ by the tender fingers of a cool morning breeze. His open collar shirt ruffles\
  \ gracefully in the pleasant rhythm of a simple life. This is a good life.\n\nWe\
  \ get to the spot. It is empty. Despite the faffing we were the first in the car\
  \ park. Unbelievable. My fingers wouldn\u2019t work fast enough as I tried to undo\
  \ my seatbelt. We ran to the view point and the sight that greeted my eyes was better\
  \ than I had dreamed of. Pumping 6ft waves peeled around the point, the detonating\
  \ white-water chasing a perfectly groomed face. Swell lines stacked to the horizon\
  \ behind it. \n\nWe stand there in disbelief, stunned for a moment.\n\nJust then,\
  \ a surf school bus appears."
