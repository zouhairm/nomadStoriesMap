Text: "\u201CI\u2019m sorry.  Could you repeat what you just said?\u201D   \n\n\u201C\
  Mountain biking.  That\u2019s what I want to do here.\u201D\n\n\u201CReally?\u201D\
  \ Pause while thinking back on our serene bike riding done just a few days earlier\
  \ in Tuscany.  \u201CBut, what about your bad knee, and my lack of mountain bike-riding\
  \ skills?  Isn\u2019t this the wrong time and place to learn a new sport?\u201D\
  \ \n\n\u201CMy knee is fine,\u201D husband says. \u201CLet\u2019s do this.\u201D\
  \n\nAnd it happens just that quickly when you\u2019re nearing the end of a cruise\
  \ extravaganza and you want to close it out with a bang. We\u2019d already reached\
  \ our maximum amount of tours involving cathedrals and museums. Never mind that\
  \ I\u2019m not a strong rider and know zero about mountain biking. . .\n\n\u201C\
  Okay then, welcome to Croatia!\u201D Our pert and fit guide, Adrianna, was just\
  \ a little too energetic for my cautious self, but I soon discovered that I really\
  \ didn\u2019t need to worry about her because the pack leader would most certainly\
  \ not be in my eyesight. And while I was never dead last in the \u201Cthis is not\
  \ a race\u201D battle, I made sure to stay close to at least one of the other pacers\
  \ in case my face suddenly met an olive tree.\n\n\u201CWeee, look at me!  I\u2019\
  m mountain biking in Croatia!\u201D I attempted to look calm while whizzing downhill\
  \ at a terrifying speed.  My hands were frozen in place squeezing both brakes, and\
  \ while I can\u2019t speak for the other Tour-de-Croatia members in lead positions,\
  \ I can only speak for those peddling at my \u201Cspeed\u201D, and we were all living\
  \ the moment.  Adrenaline pumping, laughing and carrying on as if it were totally\
  \ natural for us to be mountain biking in Croatia.  \n\nBut at some point that free-flowing,\
  \ no peddling, ride-as-fast-as-you-dare-downhill part of the journey was ending,\
  \ and you know what happens when you reach the lowest valley in a journey?  It\u2019\
  s uphill all the way back, baby.  \n\nThis is also where some riders started dropping\
  \ like flies. Not me.  Not yet.  I chugged, and sometimes walked, and then huffed\
  \ and puffed, one peak after another until meeting my breaking point.  I waited\
  \ by the side of the road for a rescue van and am happy to report that by the time\
  \ it got to me there was no more room left in it.  Better still, as I glanced inside\
  \ I noticed many of the \u2018young guns\u2019 had already called it quits, and\
  \ I\u2019m not too ashamed to admit a tad bit of pride in feeling that this old\
  \ gal had lasted longer than them. Slightly. \n\nSo, with no room in the van, what\
  \ happened next?  I asked if they could take my bike and I would just walk to the\
  \ end.\n\n\u201CYou can do it!  Don\u2019t stop now!\u201D (Or whatever they were\
  \ saying in Croatian.  This was the part where all things \u2013 including my legs\
  \ and brain \u2013 were starting to go mushy.)\n\n\u201CKeep going.  Be strong!\u201D\
  \n\nThat I did.  For at least ten more feet to the top of a hill where I did finally\
  \ meet up with Adrianna and husband and all the others who had somehow managed to\
  \ race ahead, even uphill.  \n\nWhatever.  \n\nThe important part here is that I\
  \ had accepted the challenge, stayed the course, and made it to the end.  Certain\
  \ that there was a yellow shirt for me but alas, it was just a charming farmhouse\
  \ with some much needed refreshments.  First plenty of that mountain fresh Croatian\
  \ water.  Then a group toast with wine that had been pressed and aged on the very\
  \ farm that we were now calling our new motherland for surely we would never leave.\
  \  At least not by bicycle.\n\nOh, and about Croatia in general?  It was charming\
  \ and an honest to goodness mix of really old with really new.  We learned that\
  \ they had experienced civil war with Yugoslavia as little as ten years prior and\
  \ now Croatians were extremely proud of their freedom.  Emerging with a solid foundation\
  \ in ecotourism and plenty of healthy outdoor activities, they are fast becoming\
  \ an \u2018it\u2019 destination for well-traveled sports-minded foreigners looking\
  \ for the new and undiscovered."
