Text: "I am one to plan ahead all the time, but on this adventure I decided to throw\
  \ caution to the wind and let the universe manifest what was to come.\n\nI landed\
  \ in Miami International airport, the unequivocal and infamous MIA. Finding the\
  \ exit was running a rat race through the Minotaur\u2019s labyrinth.  At that point,\
  \ my affair with this Everyone and No Man\u2019s Land began.\n\nMy first stop was\
  \ at South Pointe Beach where the ocean breeze led me as I walked along the pier.\
  \ The rays of sun caressed my skin all the while I was mesmerized by everyone around\
  \ me immersed in their own private worlds of rollerblading, jogging, or getting\
  \ lost in taking selfies with the splashes of blues, greens, and yellow hues of\
  \ the pier. \n\nSetting myself up on the sand, I looked at the deep blue skies and\
  \ dived into the hypnotic tunes of sultry lounge electronica. Time disappeared.\
  \ Out of nowhere, a sun-kissed glistening stranger walked up to me, opened a frozen\
  \ bag of cherries, and offered me some. Our chat began with \u201Chello, how are\
  \ you doing?\u201D in the most musical accent.  \u201CI\u2019m doing well,\u201D\
  \ I replied, as he sat next to me our chat gradually unfolded.\n\nIn English and\
  \ Portuguese, tongues melted together (yes, I learned he was Brazilian) and Portu-English\
  \ ensued. Thiago had been living in Miami for two years and was loving every moment\
  \ of it. \n\nThiago was so knowledgeable and I so eager to explore the ever-changing\
  \ m\xE9nage of world nomads from the eyes of a local, that he unexpectedly became\
  \ my tour guide.\n\nThe first spot we visited, The Corner, is an oasis in the midst\
  \ of high rises and the historic Overtown theatre district in the sweltering heat\
  \ of downtown. I walked up to its \u201Cventanita\u201D  (little window) styled\
  \ after the fa\xE7ade of a Cuban caf\xE9 from where the bartender took my first\
  \ drink order. We sat on the patio for a bit while we regained our breaths from\
  \ biking. At nightfall, Thiago and I danced and sipped cocktails until the wee hours\
  \ in the cooler indoors - where sleek met dive bar, live jazz infused candle-lit\
  \ ambiance. Before dawn, Thiago whispered, \u201CLet\u2019s get out of here,\u201D\
  \ and we hopped on our bike shares. I, of course, followed his lead, as I was intrigued\
  \ as ever to see what was coming next. \n\nBefore I realized, we were riding across\
  \ the Venetian Causeway towards Miami Beach.  We chatted, we laughed, and we got\
  \ lost in translation while I learned so much about Thiago, his family, life in\
  \ Brazil, and his journey as a political refugee. I never really thought of the\
  \ American dream but Thiago taught me what it meant. The hurdles, the endless wait\
  \ for documents, and the anxiety-fueled moments when opening correspondence from\
  \ US immigration services. Thiago shared with me his bubbling excitement to fully\
  \ start anew in America. He was the pure manifestation of the American spirit -\
  \ a courageous, compassionate soul in a new, unknown land sharing with me so much.\
  \ His candidness humbled me.\n\nWe stopped and got off our bikes half way across\
  \ the causeway by the Welcome to Miami Beach sign. There, as we sat in the midst\
  \ of laughter, the sun brought upon us a new day. And for us both, a new opportunity\
  \ to catch and release."
