Text: "I stayed in Manila, Philippines for 3 months, what an experience that was,\
  \ an experience that changed my life actually...\n\nI learned to have peace and\
  \ choose joy in hard circumstances. No, I didn't necessarily choose living in a\
  \ slum community, sleeping on the floor, finding roaches in our room at night, finding\
  \ spiders the size of my palm in the bathroom, catching over six rats in our house,\
  \ and walking miles every day in the heat and humidity or the unexpected POURING\
  \ sheets of tropical rain storms. Although those were some of the hardest times\
  \ of my life, they were also some of the best. Those times have memories attached\
  \ to them, times when we would just look at each other and laugh because there's\
  \ nothing else to do.  \n\nEvery morning when we would wake up and leave the house,\
  \ there would be groups of little kids from the neighborhood waiting to follow us\
  \ on our daily excursions. They would warmly welcome us by screaming our names and\
  \ jumping all over us. One day my friend and I decided to take it slow and hang\
  \ back while the group went out to do their projects. We left the house later to\
  \ go to a drug store to stock up on some of our necessities like toilet paper and\
  \ toothpaste. There were only a couple kids waiting at that point because the rest\
  \ followed the others earlier that morning. So we took the kids to the 7/11 on the\
  \ corner and bought them ice cream for only 19 pesos and they happily followed us\
  \ to the convenience store about a mile away. While we were in the store it had\
  \ started to rain so we sat inside and waited for it to slow down...well it never\
  \ stopped, in fact it just poured harder and harder as time went on. Pretty soon\
  \ the streets started to fill up with water and flood the sidewalks, so we decided\
  \ to just go for it because at that rate we would never get home. We stepped out\
  \ of the store and water is to our ankles so, I took my Birkenstocks off and put\
  \ them in my backpack so they wouldn't be ruined by walking through the water and\
  \ I walked barefoot through the slum streets of the Philippines. The water filled\
  \ up to my upper calves and at this point the neighborhood kids were swimming in\
  \ the streets and would go floating by us on their backs with the currents of the\
  \ water flowing down the streets. My friend and I were soaked, we couldn't see more\
  \ than five feet in front of us and we were ready to just get home after walking\
  \ a mile in that weather. Right before we got home, I looked down at one point and\
  \ literally saw a dead rat float by me down this new river that had formed in our\
  \ neighborhood. At that point it dawned on me that I was walking in this water on\
  \ these streets that housed many different stray animals including; dogs, cats,\
  \ chickens and rats whose bodies housed multiple different diseases and discarded\
  \ lots of feces...and here I was barefoot in this water. I wanted to scream, or\
  \ cry, or maybe throw up? Instead I just looked at my friend and we laughed at our\
  \ situation. What can you do in that moment, there's not much. We were grateful\
  \ to have access to a shower to clean off and extra dry clothes to change into and\
  \ that was not the reality for most people who lived in that neighborhood. Most\
  \ people who lived in that neighborhood couldn't stay out of the storms even if\
  \ they tried to go inside of their home. Most people in that neighborhood used the\
  \ flood water to fill up buckets and bathe their whole families, and wait for the\
  \ next rain to bathe again. \n\nLiving in The Philippines for the short time that\
  \ I did taught me a lot. It opened my eyes to make me realize that majority of the\
  \ world lives this way. And these people smile more than anyone I've ever met in\
  \ a western, civilized nation. It Inspires me."
