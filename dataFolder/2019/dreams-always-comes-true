Text: "Searching about it, and focusing on others\u2019 speech about its culture encourages\
  \ me alot to go there. It was my dream to travel and visit Jordan since I was at\
  \ school. Who can imagine that Amman has the same letters of Oman in our Arabic\
  \ language, the only difference is how to pronounce each one. But really I didn\u2019\
  t care of it, the most important difference to me which I could care was the culture,\
  \ are they the same as well? \n\nYear after year, my dream kept a dream till my\
  \ graduation day. I registered on a training program which planned to be at Jordan.\
  \ Honestly, I didn\u2019t expect that they could accept me, but they did and my\
  \ dream becomes a real. \n\nThe first thing I heard that time about Jordan was its\
  \ people. \u201CTaymora! Don\u2019t ever and ever talk to anyone there\u201D but\
  \ I did. I have a thought that our relations and communications don\u2019t depened\
  \ on the country of the others, it depend on us, how we deal with them? And what\
  \ are our communication tools we have in dealing with them? That will make sense\
  \ on our relation, will it go in a good direction or it will hurt us. \n\nThe trip\
  \ starts from the plane. It wasn\u2019t my first time I travel, but I felt it different\
  \ because I was alone without my family, and with friends who I didn\u2019t meet\
  \ before. It\u2019s different with us as Arab, where people think isn\u2019t good\
  \ a girl travel without anyone of her family. Even of everything, I challenged myself,\
  \ my family, and my society. \n\nGoing to Jordan was the same as going ten years\
  \ back. Seriously, I saw the differences between us and them, even of all the similarities\
  \ I found. It\u2019s old souqs, the design of its home, and its streets, all talk\
  \ about the history of Jordan. You can easily see it, see its heritage, and know\
  \ everything about it. It\u2019s like seeing a movie and understand the idea without\
  \ needing any translation. As well as the food at its restaurants, was the same\
  \ as the past one. I will be wrong if I said that they improve slowly, the right\
  \ thing that they love their history and culture more than we all imagine. \n\n\n\
  To be mentioned at the end, people who know me still asking me the same question\
  \ till now: \u201CWill you go back to Jordan again?\u201D. Is there any other word\
  \ -rather than \u201CYes\u201D- express my interest to go again? The Challenge always\
  \ becomes good, only when you link it with your dreams. Trying to achieve dreams\
  \ even these impossible one, will guide you to achieve other dreams. And that what\
  \ I\u2019m trying to do now, I think its the good time to makes another dream true."
