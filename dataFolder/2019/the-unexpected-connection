Text: "June 2018, I went to my first pride parade in West Hollywood. Me and my friends\
  \ planned it few weeks ago and we got together at the parade. I've been to WeHo\
  \ before but never been to a pride parade. I didn't know what to expect. A colleague\
  \ told me that he felt uncomfortable when he went there few years ago. He didn't\
  \ like the being called cute by other man. I've had homosexual friends before and\
  \ never really had any problems with any of them. In fact, I've always liked them.\
  \ They tend to be very sweet.\n\nThe first day, we went to the festival that was\
  \ going on by the MOCO Pacific Design Center. When we got there, I was surprised\
  \ by the amount of people at the entrance. Lucky for us, we had bought a ticket\
  \ before hand so we got into a smaller line. When we got inside, the amount of people\
  \ where even larger than at the entrance. I've never seen that much people in such\
  \ a small place. I was amazed by also the type of people that were there. There\
  \ were guys with spiked green hair to girls with just a heart sticker on their breasts.\
  \ I felt like I was at an adult Disneyland. Everywhere that I look, people were\
  \ dressed almost naked. Not gonna lie, I liked it.\n\nThe festival had about 5 stages,\
  \ where different type of songs were played. From Electronic Music, Hip Hop, Pop,\
  \ and Latin music. Every stage was wild. People drinking, smoking marijuana, doing\
  \ other sorts of drugs, making out, crazy. There was a BDSM exhibition room as well.\
  \ There were guys wearing dog masks and crawling around inside a circle, some people\
  \ were being spanked, and some BDSM toys on sell. On the big stage at the BDSM room,\
  \ there was a lady tying up another lady. It seemed hot and interesting but it was\
  \ taking long so me and my friends left the place.\n\nLater, we were by the Latin\
  \ music stage, buying drinks and I was minding my own business, dancing to the music\
  \ when a Hispanic guy came in and started dancing with me. I thought why not, and\
  \ kept dancing with him. After few seconds dancing, the guy suddenly gets close\
  \ to me and went for a kiss. For some reason, I didn't back up. I went with the\
  \ flow. It was my first gay experience. The guys stoped and seemed to like it so\
  \ he went again. Im not gonna lie, it was fun, but wasn't my thing. He grabbed my\
  \ crouch and was disappointing, not getting the results he wanted. After I bought\
  \ my drink, he came back and kissed me again. Told me goodbye and left. It was a\
  \ very different and new experience I'm not gonna regret doing.\n\nThe next day,\
  \ we went to the actual parade. It was very loving and positive. A lot of companies,\
  \ such as banks, entertainment companies, and charities were on the parade coloring\
  \ their logos in rainbow. People were giving away all sorts of free stuff. Like\
  \ condoms, chapstick, rainbow colored sunglasses, stickers, and the best, a spanking\
  \ wood which was a discount coupon for a sex shop, which we went later on to use\
  \ it. Me and my friends kept spanking each other with it during the whole day. \n\
  \nOne thing that I really loved about the parade, was that it was such a peaceful\
  \ and loving event despite the hate homosexual people get. There were some homophobic\
  \ Christian people with signs saying \"God hates homo\" out side the parade. But\
  \ the best part was the people in the parade, they stopped and they just spread\
  \ their love to them. To them, the whole event is about peace and love. There were\
  \ drunk people and some teenagers on drugs lost in their mind but aside from all\
  \ that crazy stuff, the parade was beautiful and fun. I hope to experience more\
  \ pride parades from around the world in the future."
